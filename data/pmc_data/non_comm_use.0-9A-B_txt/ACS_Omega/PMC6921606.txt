HIV in the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to
the development
of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND), even with chronic
antiretroviral therapy. In order for antiretroviral therapy to be
effective in protecting the CNS, these drugs should have the ability
to localize in brain areas known to be affected by HIV. Consequently,
this study aimed to investigate the localization patterns of three
first-line antiretroviral drugs, namely, efavirenz, tenofovir, and
emtricitabine, in the rat brain. Liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) were utilized to
assess the pharmacokinetics and brain spatial distribution of the
three drugs. Each drug was administered (50 mg/kg) to healthy female
Sprague–Dawley rats via intraperitoneal administration. LC–MS/MS
results showed that all three drugs could be delivered into the brain,
although they varied in blood–brain barrier permeability. MALDI-MSI
showed a high degree of efavirenz localization across the entire brain,
while tenofovir localized mainly in the cortex. Emtricitabine distributed
heterogeneously mainly in the thalamus, corpus callosum, and hypothalamus.
This study showed that efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine might
be a potential drug combination antiretroviral therapy for CNS protection
against HAND.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART)1 has transformed human immunodeficiency
virus acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (HIV/AIDS) from a deadly incurable disease to a well-managed
chronic disease. This transition has granted the opportunity to focus
on other severe complications associated with HIV, including renal,
cardiovascular, and neurological diseases, among others, with HIV
of the central nervous system (CNS) being the most severe. Atripla
is a fixed-dose regimen containing one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (efavirenz (EFV)) and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TFV-DF) and emtricitabine
(FTC)).2 Atripla is recommended for the
treatment of HIV type 1.

The CNS is considered a viral reservoir
for HIV where the virus
replicates independently from circulating drug levels.3 HIV invades the brain soon after infection and replicates
rapidly leading to various neurological complications.4 The virus crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
via a mechanism known as the “Trojan horse” hypothesis.
Briefly, infected monocyte-derived macrophages carry the virus into
the CNS.5,6 The viral infection spreads further within
the brain when the virus attacks the resident perivascular microglial
cells,7 T-lymphocytes, and astrocytes.8 HIV often targets the neural and microglial cells
by expressing chemokine receptors (e.g., C-X-C chemokine receptor
type 4) responsible for the infection of brain cells.9 Consequently, the brain can serve as an important sanctuary
for HIV to continuously replicate even after the systematic viral
suppression has been achieved.

Despite the extensive use of
cART, the treatment of HIV-associated
neurological disorders (HAND)10 remains
a challenge. Nearly half of HIV-infected individuals have developed
different forms of HAND.7,11 These various forms
of HAND include asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild
neurocognitive disorder (MND), and the most severe form known as HIV-associated
dementia (HAD), which primarily targets patients with low CD4 T-lymphocyte
counts.12 The mechanisms underlying HAND
are not fully understood; however, several studies suggest that most
patients display extensive neurodegeneration in specific brain regions.
Molecular imaging techniques were previously used to study the brain
regions most affected by the virus including the subcortical regions
(e.g., thalamus, basal ganglia, and hippocampus)13 and the cerebral cortex (CTX).14 The cART regimens undoubtedly reduce plasma viral load, yet their
potential to treat HAND remains unknown.15

Antiretroviral drugs must penetrate through the BBB and reach
the
infected brain cells for effective viral suppression in the CNS.16 Therefore, it is essential to investigate the
spatial distribution and localization of current antiretroviral drugs
in different brain regions and within the HIV-infected cells.

The characterization of antiretroviral drug distribution in biological
tissues has solely relied on quantifications from tissue homogenates
using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
techniques. LC–MS/MS has been used to study the pharmacokinetics,
tissue distribution, and metabolism of most antiretroviral drugs including
EFV, FTC, TFV, and more.17−19 Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)
is a powerful technology used to map the distribution of drugs and
their metabolites within tissue sections.20,21 The key advantages of using MSI include a label-free analysis approach,
high resolution, and high throughput per single experiment. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI) ionization is often used for MSI
experiments among other ionization techniques.

In this study,
LC–MS/MS was used to quantify EFV, FTC, and
TFV in plasma and brain homogenate samples following intraperitoneal
(IP) administration. Subsequently, MALDI-MSI was used to show the
localization patterns of the three antiretroviral drugs in rat brain
tissues. The results from this study provide information about the
BBB permeability toward the three drugs and to further help understand
their role in neuroprotection.

2 Results and Discussion
In this study,
we developed an LC–MS/MS method to quantify
three first-line antiretroviral drugs in rat plasma and brain homogenate
samples. The optimized LC–MS/MS method was validated in accordance
with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Bioanalytical Method Validation
Guidelines.22 Furthermore, we developed
and optimized an MALDI-MSI method that was utilized to map the CNS
exposure of the three antiretroviral drugs in rat brain tissues.

2.1 LC–MS/MS Method Development and Optimization
The precursor and product ions of the three target compounds and
their internal standards were obtained by direct injection of each
freshly prepared standard into the mass spectrometer operated in the
MRM positive ion mode (Table 1). The proposed MS fragmentation pathways are shown in Figure S2A–C. In positive ionization mode,
acidifying the mobile phase with FA was used to further enhance the
detection of [M + H] + ions.23

Chromatographic conditions were assessed, including
the LC column
selection, column temperature, mobile phase selection, and the flow
rate. The polar nature of FTC and TFV resulted in poor retention in
several commercially available chromatography columns tested. An Ascentis
Express Amide analytical column (5 cm × 2.1 mm, a particle size
of 2.7 μm, and pore size of 90 Å) resulted in satisfactory
separation compared to other columns tested when operated at room
temperature. Acetonitrile and methanol were tested with different
acid additives such as formic acid and acetic acid in varying strengths.
Methanol (0.1% v/v FA) and ultrapure water (0.1% v/v FA) resulted
in better sensitivity, efficiency, and peak shape for all analytes.
After several trial runs starting from 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and
60% methanol, we observed that starting the LC method at 30% methanol
resulted in all analytes being separated and retained in a shorter
runtime of 10 min. The LC–MS/MS method explained above was
validated following procedures described in our previous study.24 Chromatogram and validation parameters are shown
in Figure 1. The calculated
LOD and LLOQ values are shown in Table 2.

2.2 Quantitative Analysis by LC–MS/MS
A validated LC–MS/MS method was utilized for the quantification
of EFV, TFV, and FTC in rat plasma and brain homogenates following
IP administration of 50 mg/kg each drug to healthy female SD rats.
The method validation data is presented in the Supporting Information including extraction recoveries, matrix
effect (Table S2), and accuracy and precision
(Table S3A–C).

The plasma
and brain concentration–time profiles are shown in Figure 2, with their corresponding
pharmacokinetic parameters summarized in Table 3. The three drugs were detected from 0.25
to 8 h, while no traces of each drug were detected after 24 h. The
mean highest concentrations reached (Cmax) for EFV, TFV, and FTC in plasma were 3246.07 ± 480.54, 5651.72
± 672.87, and 6470.33 ± 500.57 ng/mL, respectively. All
three drugs had plasma Cmax at a Tmax of 0.25 h. The terminal half-lives (t1/2) for EFV, TFV, and FTC in plasma were 0.6,
0.9, and 0.96 h, respectively. From the plasma concentration–time
profile, the estimated area under the curve (AUC0–t) values for EFV, TFV, and FTC were 4255.38, 6807.64,
and 9796.38 ng h/mL respectively.

The quantitative analysis of homogenates of the dissected
one-half
rat brain hemisphere was performed to estimate absolute concentrations
of each drug in the brain. EFV was only detected from 0.25 to 8 h.
TFV was only detected from 0.25 to 4 h and FTC from 0.25 to 6 h, while
no traces of each drug were detected after 24 h. The mean Cmax’s for EFV, TFV, and FTC reached in
the brain were 428.54 ± 33.34, 51.06 ± 29.23, and 591.57
± 46.28 ng/g, respectively. EFV had Cmax occurring at Tmax of 0.5 and 0.25 h
for TFV and FTC, respectively. The t1/2’s for EFV, TFV, and FTC in the brain were 2.8, 1.89, and
0.65 h, respectively. The estimated brain AUC0–t values for EFV, TFV, and FTC were 1509.14, 538.50,
and 666.53 ng h/g, respectively.

In the comparison of plasma
to brain concentration levels, all
three drugs had higher concentrations in plasma than in brain homogenates.
In both plasma and brain homogenates, no drug was detected at 24 h
post-dose. The plasma concentration levels were in the order of FTC
> > TFV > EFV. Overall, the three drugs had a different BBB
penetration
affinity, with the brain concentration levels in the order of FTC
≫ EFV > TFV. These results are in accordance with previous
studies, which have demonstrated that TFV has a low CNS penetration
when compared to other antiretroviral drugs. Best et al. found that
TFV concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were only 5% of
the total plasma concentrations.25 In our
study, we found that TFV brain concentrations were 0.9% TFV of the
plasma concentrations, which is even lower than the reported CSF percentage.
Anthonypillai et al. demonstrated the ability of TFV to cross the
blood-CSF barrier and reach the CSF but at low concentrations.26 The poor BBB permeability makes it difficult
for TFV to reach the CNS. EFV was previously reported to have a high
BBB penetration with the CSF unbound above the wild-type in vitro
IC50 (0.51 ng/g) in lymphocytes, and CSF total concentrations
exceeded this IC50 value by a ratio of 26.27 The IC50 values of 0.51, 11.5, and 1.73 ng/g
were for EFV, TFV, and FTC, respectively.

Central nervous system
penetration effectiveness (CPE) scores have
been previously used to summarize and rank the CNS penetrability of
various therapeutic drugs.28 The CPE scores
are based on physiochemical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties
of drugs and CSF concentration from clinical studies.28 While these reported values reflect the extents of CNS
penetration for different drugs, they do not convey any information
regarding their concentration levels, distribution, and localization
patterns in the brain.

The drug penetration through the BBB
depends on various factors
such as molecular weight, lipophilicity (measured as log P), plasma protein binding affinity, ionization, and membrane transporters
including the influx and efflux transporters.29Table 4 shows the
physiochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of EFV, TFV, and FTC.
The influence of the molecular size on BBB penetration is inversely
related to the square root of the molecular weight.29 The Lipinski rule states that the molecular weight should
be less than 500 Da.1 Banks et al.29 proposed that the molecular weight
of drugs should be less than 450 Da to easily penetrate the BBB.10 The three antiretroviral drugs have molecular
weights less than 450 Da; therefore, other factors define their BBB
penetration. Veber’s drug-like filter is another approach for
predicting the BBB drug transit. Veber’s drug-like filter states
that molecules, with a polar surface area less or equal to 140 Å2 and no more than 10 rotatable bonds, will have a better chance
of crossing the biological barriers.31,32 From Table 4, it is clear that
both EFV and FTC satisfy these criteria. Lipophilicity has commonly
been used in the prediction of BBB penetration of drugs. A study by
Honarparvar showed that lipophilic molecules are likely to partition
into the lipid interior of membranes.32 They found that molecules with log P values from 1.5 to 2.7 have higher chances of penetration
through the BBB,33 with an average log P value of 2.2.

Table 4 Physiochemical and Biopharmaceutical
Properties of EFV, TFV, and FTC
 	physiochemical and biopharmaceutical properties

%	Å2	rotatable

EFV	315.7	4.6	99.5	38.3	1.0	
TFV	287.2	–1.6	<0.7	260.0	19.0	
FTC	247.2	0.6	<4.0	113.0	2.0	
Even though it is anticipated that lipophilic drugs
easily cross
the BBB and enter the brain, this is not always the case, as other
factors also govern the CNS deposition of drugs as shown by the variation
in drug delivery observed in this study. The binding of drugs to plasma
proteins can significantly reduce the free fraction of drugs in the
system available for CNS absorption.34 The
high protein binding of EFV35 can possibly
explain the observation that FTC concentrations are higher than EFV
in both plasma and brain, while EFV has a higher log P value of 4.6 than 0.6 for FTC (Table 4). FTC has a log P value of 0.6 and
is considered to have low lipophilicity; however, the low protein
binding of these drugs allows for increased levels available for CNS
absorption. TFV is extremely non-lipophilic with a log P value of −1.6. Although the protein binding of TFV is low
(<0.7),36 it suggests that lipophilicity
is the main factor leading to low levels of TFV in the brain. Moreover,
TFV does not comply with Veber’s drug-like filter (Table 4). Among the BBB transporters,
multidrug-resistance-associated proteins (MRP4 and MRP5) are known
to transport TFV from the brain to the bloodstream (strong efflux
transporters).37 This could be another
possible explanation for the poor BBB penetrability.

2.3 Spatial Distribution of Antiretroviral Drugs
in the Rat Brain
MALDI-MS was optimized for the detection
of the three antiretroviral drugs in rat brain tissue sections in
reflectron positive ion mode. For each drug, a protonated precursor
ion was monitored for imaging purposes. The precursor ions for EFV,
TFV, and FTC have m/z 316.673, m/z 288.121, and m/z 248.463, respectively (Figures S4–S6). A minimum of three brain sections was analyzed from each biopsy
to confirm the reproducibility of the method. The estimated CHCA matrix
applied to each slide had an average weight of 3.82 ± 0.57 mg
(n = 3). The matrix application method was highly
reproducible across all slides. Figure 3 shows the coronal rat brain images showing the localization
patterns for EFV, TFV, and FTC at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 h post-dose.

Figure 3 MALDI-MS images
of coronal rat brain sections showing a time-dependent
spatial distribution of three antiretroviral drugs. (A) Ion images
for EFV (m/z 316.673) generated
from 0 to 20% of maximum intensity, (B) for TFV (m/z 288.121) generated from 0 to 20% of maximum intensity,
and (C) for FTC (m/z 248.463) generated
from 0 to 50% of maximum intensity. Ion intensities for the three
drugs were normalized against the TIC. Spatial resolution of 100 μm
and a scale bar of 5 mm. The H&E staining with regional labels
and the regions of interest (ROIs) were confirmed using the rat brain
atlas.

The images in Figure 3A clearly show that EFV is widespread throughout
the brain; overall,
the drug is highly distributed in the cerebral cortex (CTX) and corpus
callosum (CC). EFV was also highly abundant in the basal forebrain
(BFB), globus pallidus (GP), and hippocampal formation (HPF) after
0.5 h post-dose. Figure 3B shows that TFV localizes in a different way. At 0.25 h post-dose,
high intensity is observed in the striatum in a caudoputamen (CP),
corticospinal tracts (cst), GP, and high in the CTX. In contrast, Figure 3C shows a high degree
of localization for FTC, mainly in the thalamus (TH), hypothalamus
(HY), and CC. Figure 4 shows the relative abundance of the three drugs in various brain
regions presented as bar graphs.

in different brain regions.
Images were obtained at a spatial resolution of 100 μm and a
scale bar of 2 mm. The sum ion intensities (a.u.) are presented for
each drug at 0.5 h post-dose for EFV (m/z 316.673) and 0.25 h post-dose for both TFV (m/z 288.121) and FTC (m/z 248.463).

Quantifying antiretroviral drugs in the CSF to
measure of their
potential to combat CNS-HIV is not enough. There are advanced imaging
techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron-emission tomography,
MSI, and many others; however, not enough research has been done utilizing
these techniques to visualize and understand the regional brain distribution
of antiretroviral drugs. Several studies have shown that the presence
of HIV in the brain leads to cortical atrophy resulting in different
manifestations of HAND.14,38 Significant evidence
suggests that the neurotic effects associated with HIV also originate
from other brain regions including the basal ganglia located in the
BFB,13 CC,39 and HPF.40 It has been documented that
the cortical regions are mostly affected at later stages of the disease;14 however, Ragin et al. evaluated the occurrence
and the extent of brain injury using quantitative magnetic resonance
imaging in patients infected within a year. They observed reductions
in both total and cortical gray matter.41 HAND is associated with various brain regions,13,14,38−41 and cART regimens are expected
to cross the BBB and distribute homogeneously across the brain for
improved viral suppression and better CNS protection. CTX is the main
region often associated with HAND, and our results show that EFV and
TFV reached this region with an exception of FTC.

Despite the
benefits of using cART1,33 for treatment
of HIV, HAND9,30 remain a threat to HIV-infected
people. The brain is an HIV sanctuary where the virus replicates independently
from the blood.3 To the best of our knowledge,
there are no published studies on antiretroviral drug distribution
in rat brain tissues or brain of any species for that matter.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated that MALDI-MSI
is a versatile platform to study
the spatial distribution and localization of EFV, TFV, and FTC in
situ. The three drugs reached the brain at different levels and localized
in the same brain regions associated with HAND. The coadministration
of these drugs could offer CNS protection against HAND to a certain
extent. Furthermore, this work generally demonstrated a mass spectrometric
approach that can be applied to directly detect and visualize these
clinically important analytes more broadly in biological tissues in
order to create an index that better represents drug penetration across
the BBB. Future developments in MSI will enable imaging of these drugs
at cellular and subcellular levels.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials, Chemicals, and Reagents
TFV-DF, TFV, FTC, and EFV were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Mylan
(South Africa), and Adcock Ingram (South Africa). The internal standards,
namely, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), zidovudine (ZDV), and 4-(4-carboxybenzyl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (CBB), were
all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. LC–MS-grade methanol and
acetonitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Analytical-grade formic
acid (FA) was purchased from Merck Millipore (Merck, South Africa).
The MALDI matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) was
purchased from Bruker (Bremen, Germany). A MilliQ purification system
(Bedford, MA) was used to generate ultrapure water. All other chemicals
and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade.

4.2 Animals
Twenty-seven female Sprague–Dawley
(SD) rats aged 4–5 weeks were supplied by the Biomedical Resource
Unit (University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa). The 27 animals
were randomly divided into nine groups (n = 3 for
each group). All animals were housed under air-conditioned rooms at
a constant temperature of 22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle
and given access to water and food ad libitum. The protocols followed
for the rat experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Research Ethics Committee of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Approval
reference: AREC/007/017D).

4.2.1 Drug Administration and Sampling
Each rat received a single dose (50 mg/kg) of each drug prepared
in 10% (v/v) aqueous solution of dimethyl sulfoxide via IP injection.
Three rats were euthanized via halothane inhalation at each time point
(0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 h). Blood samples were collected via
the cardiac puncture technique, transferred into K3-EDTA-coated tubes,
and centrifuged at 10000 × g for 10 min. Consequently,
the plasma samples were collected and stored at −80 °C.
After blood collection, animals were perfused with saline.42 Following perfusion, rat brain tissues were
rapidly dissected after the termination, washed with saline to avoid
any possible blood contamination, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
(−80 °C). All collected brains were stored at −80
°C until further treatment. Each frozen brain was cut into two
hemispheres where one-half was allocated for MALDI-MSI and the other
one was for LC–MS/MS analysis, respectively.

4.3 Sample Preparation for LC–MS/MS
4.3.1 Plasma Samples
5 μL of internal
standard (500 ng/mL) was added to 100 μL of the plasma homogenate
sample. The mixture was briefly vortexed, and 895 μL of methanol
was added to extract target analytes while inducing the precipitation
of proteins. The mixture was further vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged
at 10000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove
the precipitate. The supernatant was filtered through a Supel-Select
HLB (30 mg, 1 mL) (Supelco, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solid-phase extraction
(SPE) cartridge. The selection of SPE cartridges was based on analyte
percentage recovery after filtration (Table S1). The extract was collected into autosampler vials and vortexed
briefly before injecting 5 μL into the LC–MS/MS system.

4.3.2 Brain Samples
Half of each brain
(hemisphere) was weighed and homogenized in three volumes of ultrapure
water (3 mL/g tissue). The same extraction procedure used for plasma
samples was followed for brain homogenate samples.

The quality
control (QC) samples were prepared at different concentration levels
(low, mid, and high) following the same protocol described above.
Each QC sample was prepared by spiking the sample matrix (plasma or
brain) with varying amounts of target compounds and constant amounts
of their respective internal standards. The limit of detection (LOD)
and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were determined using
signal-to-noise ratios of ≤3 and ≤5, respectively. The
validation parameters including the extraction recovery, matrix effect,
and accuracy and precision (intraday and interday) were assessed as
previously described by Bratkowska et al.24

4.4 LC–MS/MS Analysis
Liquid chromatography
(LC) was performed on a Thermo Scientific Dionex UltiMate 3000 instrument
equipped with a binary solvent delivery system and an autosampler
(Dionex Softron GmbH, Germany). Chromatographic separation was achieved
by gradient elution at room temperature on a 5 cm Ascentis Express
Amide analytical column with an internal diameter of 2.1 mm, particle
size of 2.7 μm, and pore size of 90 Å. The mobile phases
were ultrapure water with 0.1% v/v FA (A) and methanol with 0.1% v/v
FA (B). The gradient LC method was initially increased from 30 to
100% B in 6.5 min. It was then held at 100% for 0.5 min before returning
to the initial composition over 0.5 min. The injection volume was
5 μL, the flow rate was set at 0.35 mL/min, and the equilibration
time was 2.5 min.

Mass spectrometric detection was performed
on an Amazon speed ion trap (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with
an electrospray ionization ion source. The detection of all the analytes
was performed in positive ion mode where the [M + H] + ion
was selected as a precursor ion. The multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode was selected to monitor the mass transitions (precursor
ions → product ions) of EFV, TFV, FTC, and their internal standards
(CBB, ADV, and ZDV). Other mass spectrometric conditions are as follows:
nebulizer: 1.5 bar, dry gas: 1.8 L/min, dry temperature: 180 °C,
scan range: m/z 50 → 600.
Data were analyzed using Data Analysis 4.0 SP 5 and Quant Analysis
2.1 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).

4.5 Sample Preparation for MALDI-MS Imaging
A Leica Microsystems CM1100 (Wetzlar, Germany) cryostat was set
at −20 °C and used for all the tissue sectioning. All
brain sections (12 μm thickness) were sectioned at −1.13
mm anterior bregma. Once sliced, the sections were carefully thawed-mounted
onto indium titanium oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Bruker Daltonics,
Bremen, Germany). The glass slides were stored in a deep freezer at
−80 °C until further sample treatment. The slides were
removed from the freezer (prior analysis) and placed into a desiccator
for 20 min at room temperature to avoid air water condensation on
the sample surface. Optical images were acquired using an HP LaserJet
3055 all-in-one printer prior matrix application. The CHCA matrix
solution was prepared at 7 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA.
ImagePrep (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was used to uniformly
deposit the matrix onto the slides following a standardized previously
described method.23 Briefly, it is a five-cycle
method, and each cycle is composed of three steps including spraying,
incubation, and drying. Matrix deposition was in the form of an aerosol.
The fine droplets (size of ∼20 μm) were generated using
a vibrating spray generator. The CHCA matrix crystal size ranged from
5 to 15 μm with an average of 10 μm. The average total
thickness of the matrix layer was 1.5 V. ImagePrep was operated at
controlled conditions under nitrogen (N2). Each glass slide
was weighed before and after matrix deposition to determine the total
amount of matrix standard applied by difference.

4.6 MALDI-MS Image Acquisition
The acquisition
of the mass spectra was achieved using an Autoflex III MALDI-time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped
with a Smartbeam Nd:YAG laser (355 nm). The MALDI-MS method was optimized
for the detection of the three compounds by spotting freshly prepared
standards on a ground steel MALDI target plate and on an untreated
brain tissue section. External calibration was performed using CHCA
matrix ions and a Peptide Calibration Standard Kit II (Bruker Daltonics).
Three batches of brain tissue sections were analyzed for each drug.
All experiments were carried out in the full-scan reflectron positive
mode within the mass range of m/z 100–550. The optimum laser power was kept at 65% for all
the compounds. Each pixel was collected with 500 shots per spectrum
in 10 random walk shot steps at a digitization rate of 0.5 GS s–1 and a spatial resolution of 100 μm. The LIFT
MS/MS experiments were performed in brain tissues to further confirm
each analyte, and the data is reported in Table S6.

4.7 Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining
After
MALDI-MSI analysis, the matrix was removed with 70 and 100% EtOH,
and the slides were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E).
The H&E images of the stained slides were generated using a scanner
(Leica SCN 400, Leica Microsystems).

4.8 Image Processing
For detailed analysis,
the raw MALDI-MS data was exported as an imzML file from FlexImaging
4.1 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and imported into
MSIQuant analysis Lab software (Uppsala University, Sweden).43 MSIQuant was then used to process the data.
All images were normalized against the total ion current (TIC). The
relative intensities were adjusted for each analyte to improve the
quality of images.

4.9 Statistical Analysis
Pharmacokinetics
and statistical calculations were computed using Stata 13 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX). Graphical presentation of the data was plotted
using Microsoft Excel. All values were presented as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) from three independent experiments (n = 3).
