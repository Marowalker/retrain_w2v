Hydrogels based on bile salts and
lanthanide ions have been reported
for their easy gelation. However, the weak mechanical properties and
water quenching to luminescence of lanthanide ions limit their applications
in practice. Hence, a supramolecular ionogel has been prepared here
through simply mixing of sodium deoxycholate and europium nitrate
in a protic ionic liquid, ethylammonium nitrate (EAN). The prepared
ionogel was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy-dispersive
spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder
diffraction, fluorescence spectroscopy, and rheological measurements.
Such an ionogel resulted synergistically from metal coordination and
hydrogen bonding. The effect of the solvent structure on gel properties
was also explored by comparison with those formed in alkylammonium
nitrates with longer chains. EAN was found to behave more effectively
both as a solvent and a bridge to enhance the ionogel mechanical strength.
The ionogels also exhibited better fluorescent properties than those
of the corresponding hydrogels. The obtained results should expand
the applications of lanthanide-containing luminescent soft materials
in nonaqueous media. It is expected to apply in the fields of solid
electrolytes, biosensors, and optics response.

1 Introduction
Supramolecular
gel has become one of the important research directions
of supramolecular chemistry because of its unique physical and chemical
properties. It is mainly formed by gelator molecules through noncovalent
interactions, including van der Waals interaction, π–π
stacking, hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, metal coordination,
and so forth.1 Gelators are mainly low
molecular weight organic molecules, especially some biomolecules such
as sugars, peptides, amino acids, and their derivatives, which make
supramolecular gels to have many advantages, including high purity
and easy gelation,2 and find broad applications
in fields of sensor, detection, and drug delivery.3−5

It is
well known that solvents play important roles in the supramolecular
self-assembly process. Different solvents may result in different
morphologies and properties of aggregates.6 Nowadays, most research studies on supramolecular gels are mainly
concentrated on those formed in water and organic solvents. As a novel
nonaqueous solvent, the ionic liquid (IL) is composed of organic cation
and anion, which can be classified into two types, the protic or the
aprotic, depending on whether or not the hydrogen-bonding network
can be formed. Among them, ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) is the most
widely studied protic IL.7 Compared with
traditional solvents, IL exhibits a series of outstanding merits such
as low vapor pressure, recyclability, wide liquid range, and good
solubility for a large number of organic or inorganic substances.8 It can also support the self-assembly of amphiphiles.9 Therefore, ionogels with IL as solvents have
attracted researchers’ attention and exhibited broaden practical
applications.10 For examples, Kimizuka
and Nakashima synthesized an ether-containing IL, which could dissolve
amide-rich glycolipid to prepare ionogel.11 This is the first ionogel constructed by low molecular weight gelators
via self-assembly. Maruyama et al. synthesized a gelator composed
of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acids and amino acid methyl esters to
form ionogel at lower gelator concentrations.12 These studies have shown that the hydrogen bonding plays a key role
in gel formation. Within a wide range of concentration of gelators,
the ionogel could retain excellent conductivity and some solid-like
properties, such as easy operation and higher mechanical strength.13 Lunstroot et al. obtained an imidazolium IL
by doping Eu(III) tetrakis β-diketonate complex and prepared
an ionogel by immobilizing above IL in a silica grid. The ionogel
exhibited red light under ultraviolet light irradiation and performed
good ionic conductivity.14 Feng et al.
synthesized carboxyl-functionalized IL which can sensitize the luminescence
of lanthanide ions to form the complex. The complex further coordinated
to silylated bipyridine, resulting in ionogel through hydrolysis and
condensation.15 Cheng et al. studied the
gelation behavior of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium alkylcarboxylates
in the mixed solvent of EAN and water.16

Bile salts (BSs) are one kind of important biological surfactants
and can also act as gelators. Their respective structures include
a polar hydrophilic surface, a nonpolar hydrophobic surface, and a
short hydrophilic tail.17 BSs are natural
anionic surfactants that can self-assemble in aqueous media to form
supramolecular structures such as micelles,18 hydrogels,19 and liquid crystals.20 Among them, the hydrogels based on sodium lithocholate
or deoxycholate (NaDC) can be formed under appropriate pH conditions.19,21,22 Adding metal ions to BS systems,
however, can improve gel performance because the introduced metal
ions not only triggers the self-assembly process23 but also imparts unique properties to gels such as conductivity24 and luminescence.25 Huang et al. have studied the photoluminescent hydrogel produced
from sodium cholate (NaC) and lanthanide ions.26,27 Meanwhile, they reported a series of hydrogels formed by different
metal ions and NaC in water.28 It was found
that the lanthanide ions are much beneficial for molecular aggregation
because of their large ionic radii and high coordination numbers.
Wang et al. also studied the hydrogel prepared by mixing NaDC and
Eu3+ and found the synergistic driving effect by metal
coordination, hydrogen bonding, steric effect, hydrophobic interaction,
and van der Waals interaction on gel formation.29

Though studies on hydrogels containing BS have been
widely developed,
there is no report on corresponding ionogel formation. Meanwhile,
the weak mechanical strength or viscoelasticity of hydrogels and water
quenching to luminescence of lanthanide ions often limit their practical
applications. However, the gels formed in ILs exhibited enhanced mechanical
strength compared to hydrogels and organogels.30 In addition, as one kind weakly coordination nonaqueous
solvent, IL can fundamentally shield the quenching effect of water
to improve the luminescence of lanthanide ions.8 For these motivations, we tried in this work to prepare
a supramolecular luminescent ionogel by adding Eu3+ to
an EAN solution of NaDC, which triggered the self-assembly inside
the system. Through detailed characterizations, the better physicochemical
properties of obtained ionogels and the role of solvents on gel formation
have been presented. Compared with other lanthanide-containing ionogels
which are mainly obtained by doping lanthanide in IL or solid supports,
the ionogel prepared here was constructed directly into nanofibers
through metal coordination and hydrogen bonding. The europium ion
acted not only as the luminescence center but also as the bridging
point to promote one-dimensional growth of nanofibers, whereas EAN
molecule behaved both as a solvent and as a bridge to enhance the
mechanical properties of obtained ionogel.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Gelation Behavior
The aggregated
systems composed of BSs and lanthanide ions in aqueous solutions have
already been reported.26,31 Generally, excellent gelation
behaviors could be observed. However, the applications of these hydrogels
are often limited because of weak mechanical properties and water
quenching to luminescence.31 To overcome
this difficulty, the ionogel was prepared here by Eu(NO3)3 and NaDC in EAN at 25 °C. It should be indicated
that neither NaDC nor Eu(NO3)3 could form gels
in EAN separately, which clearly reflected the fact that such an ionogel
should be formed by the supramolecular complex of NaDC and Eu(NO3)3.

With the inverse tube method, the preliminary
phase diagram of gel formation was obtained and is shown in Figure S1. It was found that the gel phase regions
became wider as the NaDC concentration (CNaDC) increased. Take Eu(III)–NaDC–EAN system at 50 mM
NaDC as an example, the phase diagram at different Eu3+ concentrations (CEu(III)) is shown in Figure 1. The samples were
in a sol state at lower CEu(III) (below
2.5 mM) and in a precipitate state at higher CEu(III) (above 750 mM), whereas the homogeneous ionogel was
formed in between. It is reported that the lanthanide-deoxycholate
hydrogels are usually opaque.29 However,
the formed ionogels here were mainly transparent or translucent (see Figure S2). Following detailed characterizations
on gel properties would be focused on samples at 50 mM CNaDC.

Figure 1 Phase diagram of the Eu(III)–NaDC–EAN system
at different
Eu3+ concentrations.

2.2 Morphology of the Ionogel
The difference
in gel appearance between ionogel and hydrogel can be attributed to
the gel microstructure organization degree. The ordered molecular
packing corresponds to the transparent state, whereas the collapsed
structure leads to the opaque state.32 Usually,
the lanthanide-deoxycholate hydrogels consisted of disordered and
separate fiber or particles.29 However,
different gel microstructures were observed in EAN. As seen from Figure 2a–e for scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of xerogel samples at different CEu(III), the ionogels were present as cross-linked
networks composed of large amounts of entangled nanofibers with diameters
ranging from 20 to 80 nm. As CEu(III) increased,
the fibers became more compact, especially at 250 mM. These similar
morphologies indicated that the ionogels at different CEu(III) were formed from the same building blocks. Generally,
such network structures of ionogels were more ordered than those of
hydrogels, thus causing better transparency. Meanwhile, the X-ray
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) result shown in Figure 2f revealed the existence of
Eu, C, and O elements in nanofibers, confirming the Eu3+ participation in gel formation.

(b); 100 (c); 250 (d); and 500 (e) with xerogel EDS result at 500
mM Eu3+ (f).

2.3 Mechanical Property of the Ionogel
The mechanical strengths of formed ionogels were compared by rheological
measurements. Usually, the elastic (G′) and
viscous (G″) moduli of gel are independent
of applied yield stress in stress sweep.33 The gel microstructure might be destroyed, however, when yield stress
reaches a critical value (τ*), where G′
and G″ dropped immediately. The G′ platform value and τ* are adopted to reflect the gel
mechanical strength.

Figure 3a shows the stress sweep curves of ionogels at different CEu(III). With increasing CEu(III), both G′ and G″ were elevated little and then dropped. Their maximum values
were obtained at 250 mM CEu(III), suggesting
the strongest mechanical strength of the ionogel at this moment. Meanwhile,
the τ* value reached a maximum at 250 mM CEu(III), also indicating the formation of most robust ionogel,
which was consistent with SEM observations. The G′ values (∼104 Pa) here were about 3 orders
of magnitude larger than that of hydrogel,29 showing much improved mechanical properties, which might be resulted
from the bridging between NaDC molecules by EAN.34

Figure 3 G′ (solid) and G″
(hollow) profiles of ionogels at 25 °C as a function of applied
stress (a) and frequency (b) at different CEu(III).

The frequency sweep was used to
determine the viscoelasticity of
ionogels. The obtained results are shown in Figure 3b. The G′ and G″ of samples were found to be independent of frequency,
and G′ was always about 1 order of magnitude
higher than G″, which was a typical property
of gel, denoting a solid-like state.

2.4 Formation
Mechanism of the Ionogel
To investigate the intermolecular
interactions and ionogel formation
mechanism, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) measurements were carried out.

Figure 4 shows FT-IR spectra of NaDC powder and xerogels
formed at different CEu(III). A broad
peak at 3410 cm–1 corresponding to the symmetric
and antisymmetric O–H stretching vibrations of hydroxyl group
could be seen in NaDC powder. Upon the ionogel formation, this peak
position was shifted to 3440 cm–1, which was caused
by reconstruction of hydrogen bonding due to gel formation.35 The previous stronger hydrogen bonding in NaDC
powder was weakened because of the coordination of carboxylate group
to Eu3+. Besides, the peak difference (Δν)
between asymmetric (νas) and symmetric (νs) stretchings of carboxylate groups can reflect the coordination
modes of them in NaDC with Eu3+.36 The νas and νs peaks were located
at 1551 and 1406 cm–1 in NaDC powder, respectively.
However, the νs moved to 1378 cm–1 in the ionogel, indicating the occurrence of coordination between
carboxylate group and Eu3+. The small Δν value
(<200 cm–1) indicated a bidentate coordination
mode between NaDC and Eu3+.37 The absence of symmetry stretching of carbonyl around 1704 cm–1 indicated that the carboxylic acid group was deprotonated
in the ionogel.19 Therefore, the hydrogen
bonding and metal coordination interactions should be the main driving
forces to induce the ionogel formation.

Figure 4 FT-IR spectra of NaDC
(a) and xerogels at different CEu(III) (mM) of 10 (b); 50 (c); 100 (d); 250 (e); and
500 (f).

To further explore the role of
EAN in ionogels, the FT-IR measurement
on ionogels was also done with the results shown in Figure S3. The N–H stretching vibration peaks from
EAN appeared at 3053 and 2987 cm–1 with relatively
high intensities. The peak at 2415 cm–1 corresponded
to the contact ion pairs between NO3– and CH3CH2NH3+ in EAN.
Compared with pure EAN, this peak in the ionogel was moved gradually
to 2404 cm–1 with reduced intensity, which could
be explained by loosing of contact ion pairs.38

To get more reliable gel structure model, we performed XRD
measurement
on ionogel-derived xerogels. As shown in Figure 5, the samples at different CEu(III) exhibited two main diffraction peaks at 5.8°
and 9.2°, which kept nearly constant in different samples. According
to Bragg’s law, the d-spacings corresponding
to the first and second diffraction peaks were calculated as 1.51
and 0.96 nm, respectively. They corresponded to a deoxycholate anion
(DC–) backbone length (∼1.5 nm) or twice
the width (∼0.6 nm).28 It has been
reported that NaDC can be assembled into a unique two-layer structure
because of hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups.39 Therefore, the observed diffraction peaks might reflect
a fact that one DC– anion was linked to another
via a hydrogen bonding between the carboxylate and the hydroxyl groups
to form a DC– pair structure (see Figure S4).22 Compared to the d-spacing observed in the lanthanide–NaDC–water
system (∼1.70 nm), the decreased d value here
indicated a closer packing of NaDC in the ionogel, which might be
resulted from the reduced electrostatic repulsion between DC– anions by the EAN shielding effect. Probably, this is one of the
reasons why ionogels have higher mechanical strength.

at different CEu(III) (mM) of 50 (a);
100 (b); and 250 (c).

As well known, NaDC is a facial amphiphile consisting of
a polar
face with two hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups and a nonpolar face
with methyl groups.26,29 Compared with conventional surfactants,
the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in NaDC are not clearly separated.
In the absence of metal ions, NaDC can form the gel in water through
the combination of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, van
der Waals force, and steric effect. Each two DC– anions are connected by hydrogen bonding in water, with a hydrophilic
cavity formed. The nonpolar faces of DC– pairs stack
together by the hydrophobic effect.19 However,
in EAN, the ionogel formation mechanism was different. As shown in Scheme 1 for possible ionogel
formation process, the pure NaDC itself could not self-assemble into
a gel state in EAN (Scheme 1A) because of weaker solvophobic effect of DC– in EAN than that in water. It was difficult to form cross-linked
fibers only by hydrogen bonding between DC– pairs,
which were mainly dispersed in EAN. Though EAN molecules with short
chains could act as a bridge to link DC– pairs,
the intermolecular forces were too weak to form large aggregates.
Europium ion has a large ionic radius and a high coordination number,
which can bind multiple carboxylate groups. Then, the addition of
Eu3+ would trigger the gelation behavior by metal coordination
interaction (Scheme 1B,C). It can be confirmed by IR results that the hydrogen bonding
between NaDC molecules and metal coordination between Eu3+ and carboxylate groups were both existed in the xerogel skeleton.
Meanwhile, the d-spacings calculated by XRD data
further proved the structure where DC– pairs were
connected. The DC– pairs bridged by EAN molecule
were thus connected to form a fiber network structure. With increasing CEu(III), the coordination of NaDC to Eu3+ became gradually saturated. Meanwhile, EAN was a weak coordination
ligand and could solvate Eu3+, which made the fiber structure
adhered together. In addition, the electrostatic shielding effect
of EAN reduced the electrostatic repulsion of DC– pairs. Therefore, within a suitable Eu3+ concentration
range, the more compact microstructure and therefore the continuously
enhanced mechanical strength of ionogel could be observed. The gelation
concentration range of CEu(III) was also
wider than that of the hydrogel. After adding excessive Eu3+ (Scheme 1D), the
gel could not be formed because of the destruction of the bridged
molecular layers. The precipitate was then obtained because the saturated
coordination made it impossible to connect NaDC molecules to form
network structure. The ordered ionogel structure was thus collapsed,
and the precipitate was produced because of the formation of less
soluble europium deoxycholate.

2.5 IL Structure
Effect on the Ionogel
To further explore the role of solvent
molecules in gelation, we
chose propylammonium nitrate (PAN) and butylammonium nitrate (BAN)
as solvents to obtain 50 mM NaDC solution, which have one or two more
methylene groups than EAN. The pure NaDC–PAN solution still
failed to form ionogel and displayed a lower solubility for NaDC.
However, after the addition of Eu3+, the ionogel was formed
in a smaller Eu3+ concentration range (10–30 mM).
For the NaDC–BAN system, however, no gel could be formed no
matter with or without Eu3+. The possible reason of narrowed
gelation range in PAN and failure gelation in BAN was possibly due
to the weaker solvophobic effect and bridging effect as the hydrophobic
chain extended longer. Studies have shown that the aggregation behaviors
of surfactants in PAN and BAN are more difficult than that in EAN.40 The solvophobic effect in BAN is too weak to
induce the gel formation.

We performed rheological measurements
on the Eu(III)–NaDC–PAN ionogel at 50 mM NaDC and 10
mM Eu3+ with results shown in Figure S5. Compared with the stress sweep data of Eu(III)–NaDC–EAN
ionogel at the same CEu(III) and CNaDC, τ* and G′
values in the PAN system were greater, reflecting better mechanical
properties (Figure S5a). The frequency
sweep results shown in Figure S5b indicated
that G′ of Eu(III)–NaDC–PAN
ionogel was still an order of magnitude larger than G″ and independent of frequency, showing the typical gel characteristics.
The reason for increased mechanical strength in PAN should be attributed
to PAN’s cosurfactant effect. The increased one ethylene group
might enhance the solvophobic interactions between DC– pairs.41

2.6 Photophysical
Property of the Ionogel
We further explored the luminescent
properties of obtained Eu(III)–NaDC–EAN
ionogels. The measured excitation (λem = 620 nm)
and emission (λex = 399 nm) spectra of ionogels at
different CEu(III) are illustrated in Figure S6. Their excitation spectra in Figure S6a showed two broad peaks appearing among
350–500 nm, which were resulted from the 4f6 transition
peaks of Eu3+ at 399 nm (7F0 → 5L6) and 465 nm (7F0 → 5D2).42 The corresponding
emission spectra were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 399
nm and are shown in Figure S6b. Four emission
bands concentrated at 595, 620, 653, and 698 nm were observed, corresponding
to 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions of Eu3+, respectively. Additionally, as can be seen from Figure S6, the fluorescence intensity gradually
increased upon increasing Eu3+ concentration. The strongest
peak at 620 nm, ascribed to the electronic transition of the 5D0 → 7F2 level, was
also known as the ultrasensitive transition. Therefore, the ionogels
exhibited intense red light under ultraviolet light irradiation, as
displayed in Figure S7.

It is well
known that IL is a weak coordinating solvent to lanthanide ions, which
can fundamentally shield the quenching effect of water molecule. For
comparison, the excitation and emission spectra of hydrogel at the
same Eu3+concentration were also investigated. Figure 6a,b exhibits the
excitation and emission spectra of hydrogel and ionogel at 50 mM CEu(III). Obviously, the luminescence intensity
of ionogel was much stronger than that of hydrogel. The fluorescence
decay profiles of 5D0 → 7F2 transitions of such two gels were also measured and are shown
in Figure 6c. The corresponding
fluorescence lifetime (t) values are listed in Table S1. Compared to that of hydrogel (386.64
μs), the t value (696.83 μs) of ionogel
increased significantly, which was attributed to the elimination of
water quenching. In order to further characterize luminescence enhancement,
the absolute luminescence quantum yields of two gels were also measured
and listed results in Table S1. It can
be seen that the quantum yield of the ionogel (15.41%) was also improved,
well consistent with the results of emission spectra and lifetimes.

decay curves (c) of ionogel and hydrogel at 50 mM Eu3+ and

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared a supramolecular ionogel by mixing
Eu(NO3)3 and NaDC in a protic IL, EAN. Though
the DC– pairs were formed by intermolecular hydrogen
bonding, there was no gelation process for NaDC itself in EAN. However,
with the help of Eu3+ coordination interaction, the ionogel
was formed. EAN behaved here both as a solvent and as a bridge to
link the DC– pairs. It was further found that the
ionogel mechanical strength was gradually strengthened with increasing
the concentration of Eu3+ and the ionogel could be formed
in an a broader gelation concentration range than that in water. Comparing
the EAN system with those in PAN and BAN, we could observe an enhanced
ionogel mechanical strength by using PAN both as a solvent and also
as a cosurfactant, whereas in the BAN system, the increased alkyl
chain made it impossible to form any ionogel. Meanwhile, the fluorescence
performance of obtained ionogel was significantly improved by fundamentally
shielding the quenching effect of water molecules. Therefore, as the
first reported BS-based ionogels with many improved properties, they
are expected to find more uses in fields such as solid electrolytes,
biosensors, and optical device. The obtained results here should also
be referrable for broadening the study of soft materials formed in
ILs.

4 Experimental Section

NaDC was obtained from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Eu(NO3)3·6H2O was purchased from Beijing HWRK Chemical Co.
Ltd. Above reagents were used without further purification. EAN, PAN,
and BAN were prepared according to the steps introduced by Evans et
al.43 High-purity water with a resistivity
of 18.4 MΩ·cm was formed from a FLOM water purification
system (Qingdao).

4.2 Sample Preparation
Stock solutions
of NaDC or Eu(NO3)3 (denoted as Eu(III)) were
obtained by dissolving desired amount reagent in EAN. The mixtures
were homogenized by ultrasound and heating until all solids dissolved.
Typically, the stock solutions were incubated at 25 °C for at
least 3 h. The Eu(III)–NaDC–EAN samples were obtained
by directly mixing different concentration stock solutions of NaDC
and Eu(NO3)3. Generally, the sample solutions
were equilibrated at 25 °C for at least 4 weeks before the phase
behavior was observed.

4.3 Preparation of Xerogels
The ionogels
were immersed in acetonitrile for 7 days, and the acetonitrile was
replaced every 12 h. Then, the samples were dried via vacuum freeze
drying, and the xerogels have been obtained.44

4.4 Methods and Characterization

FT-IR spectra
were obtained by an Alpha-T spectrometer (Bruker) from 400 to 4000
cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. For the solid sample, a small amount of it was added into dried
KBr salt and then compressed into a transparent plate. For the ionogel
and IL, they were coated on a KBr plate for measurement.

4.4.3 X-ray Powder Diffraction
