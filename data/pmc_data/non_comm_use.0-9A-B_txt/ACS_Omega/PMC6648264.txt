Anatase and brookite
are robust materials with enhanced photocatalytic
properties. In this study, we used density functional theory (DFT)
with a hybrid functional and the Hubbard on-site potential methods
to determine electron- and hole-polaron geometries for anatase and
brookite and their energetics. Localized electron and hole polarons
were predicted not to form in anatase using DFT with hybrid functionals.
In contrast, brookite formed both electron and hole polarons. The
brookite electron-polaronic solution exhibits coexisting localized
and delocalized states, with hole polarons mainly dispersed on two-coordinated
oxygen ions. Hubbard on-site potential testing over the wide 4.0–10
eV range revealed that brookite polarons are formed at U = 6 eV, while anatase polarons are formed at U =
8 eV. The brookite electron polaron was always localized on a single
titanium ion under the Hubbard model, whereas the hole polaron was
dispersed over four oxygen atoms, consistent with the hybrid DFT studies.
The anatase electron polarons were dispersed at lower on-site potentials
but were more localized at higher potentials. Both methods predict
that brookite has a higher driving force for the formation of polarons
than anatase.

1 Introduction
Titania
(TiO2) is used in a variety of applications,
including sensors,1−3 photocatalysis,4−7 and dye-sensitized solar cells,8−10 and has been
the popular choice of material in the aforementioned applications
because of its low cost, lack of toxicity, and thermal stability.
Common TiO2 polymorphs, namely rutile, anatase, and brookite,
exhibit different photocatalytic activities, irrespective of their
identical chemical compositions. The most stable rutile and anatase
polymorphs have been extensively investigated, both experimentally11−14 and theoretically,15−17 in order to understand their differences in photocatalytic
activity. Because of the well-known difficulties associated with the
synthesis of pure brookite titania, the literature related to the
brookite polymorph is limited.18 A recent
study pointed out that electron and hole trapping in titania polymorphs
play vital roles in photocatalytic activity.19 The authors emphasized that trapping depth was crucial for photocatalysis
performance, and reported that brookite has a moderate trapping depth;
hence brookite is active in photocatalytic reductions and oxidations.
In contrast, anatase has a very shallow trapping depth, which reduces
the lifetimes of photogenerated electrons and holes because of recombination.19 Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of electron
and hole formation in titania polymorphs is very important for developing
an understanding of the catalytic properties of these materials.

The formation of photogenerated electrons and holes is accompanied
by lattice vibrations (phonons) that are quasiparticles collectively
known as “polarons”.20 Therefore,
polaron formation is always associated with lattice distortion. The
pioneering theoretical work of Deskins and Dupuis21−23 provided detailed
information on the structures of electron and hole polarons in both
rutile and anatase polymorphs based on the Hubbard on-site potential
method. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the fact that no universal
Hubbard U parameter is capable of reproducing all
of the experimental observations; depending on the properties of interest,
the most suitable U value for the model must be obtained
by trial and error. In that work, the authors used 10 eV as the effective
Hubbard parameter for investigating the electron- and hole-transport
properties in both rutile and anatase. However, recent studies using
the constrained random-phase approximation proposed effective U values of 3.9 eV for rutile and 4.1 eV for anatase.24 These authors found that the excess electron
was homogeneously distributed (delocalized); consequently electron-polaron
formation is unfavorable in a perfect anatase crystal lattice; moreover,
they claimed that anatase forms electron polarons next to oxygen vacancies
on its surface. Selloni and Di Valentin.25 intensively studied electron- and hole-polaron formation in the
anatase polymorph using the B3LYP hybrid functional. They also proposed
electron-polaron formation on the anatase surface due to the higher
trapping energy at the (101) surface than in bulk anatase.

Mo
and Ching26 reported the electronic
structure and optical properties of the brookite polymorph (as well
as rutile and anatase) using the orthogonalized linear combination
of atomic orbitals method in the local density approximation. These
workers were aware of the electron self-interaction error and introduced
a self-interaction correction and Green’s function-based quasiparticle
terms to correct this issue. Therefore, screened Coulomb potentials
that include range-separated hybrid density functional theory (DFT)
functionals appear in the literature for studying titania phases.
McKenna et al.27 recently reported charge
transfer levels for several polymorphs of titania, including rutile,
anatase, brookite, TiO2 (H), TiO2 (R), and TiO2 (B) using their own hybrid-functional based on the generalized
Koopmans condition to minimize the self-interaction error of electrons.
The authors showed hole-polaron formation in anatase and brookite,
however electron-polaron formation was not observed. Consequently,
the different photocatalytic activities are naturally attributed to
the formation of different polarons in the titania phases. However,
electron paramagnetic resonance results showed that both anatase and
brookite phases contain reduced Ti3+ centers, which are
precursors for electron-polaron formation.28 VandeVondele and Spreafico.29 reported
that electron-polaron formation in titania depends on the system size
and the amount of exact exchange. Hence, they proposed the application
of the random phase approximation on top of PBE0 hybrid orbitals with
a 30% exact exchange. In addition, an 864 atom supercell was suggested
as the best compromise between computational time and accuracy for
calculating the electron-polaron formation energy of anatase; these
are highly computationally demanding or prohibitively expensive tasks
using the current infrastructure of most computing centers.

The recent literature19,30−32 provides experimental
evidence for higher photocatalytic activities
of the pure and mixed phases of brookite. However, a lack of fundamental
understanding about the polaron structure of the brookite phase hinders
the development of visible light active photocatalysts based on brookite.
According to our knowledge, no account of the polaron structure of
the brookite phase of titania has been reported to date. In this study,
we investigated the electron- and hole-polaron structures of the bulk
phases of anatase and brookite using the PBE0 hybrid functional and
Hubbard on-site potential method. In order to reduce computational
costs, we deliberately used a 48 atom system for comparing the anatase
and brookite results. Based on our findings, we explain the experimental
trends currently observed for the anatase and brookite systems.

2 Computational Details
The electronic structures of
pure anatase and brookite stoichiometric
bulk phases were studied using conventional cells and 48 atom supercells
using the plane-wave DFT code in the Vienna Ab initio Software Package
(VASP).33,34 Core electrons were described by the projector
augmented wave method with a 650 eV cutoff.35 Here, we used large cores for both the Ti and O atoms, with valence
electron configurations of 3d24s2 and 2s22p4, respectively. Our large core approximation
is justified by the calculated band gap values that agreed well with
the optical band gap of these materials. Initially, the orbitals were
calculated with the PBE-GGA exchange–correlation functional36,37 with tight criteria for the allowed errors in total orbital energies
(EDIFF = 10–8), and a 5 × 5 × 5 Monkhorst–pack
grid.38 Frequency calculations were subsequently
performed to check the convergence and to confirm the sufficiency
of the above mentioned Monkhorst–pack grid for these systems.
These DFT orbitals were used as the starting points for PBE0-hybrid
calculations.39 Exact exchanges of 25,
30, and 35%, with a 100% PBE correlation energy were used in the PBE0-hybrid
calculations. A more robust normal algorithm with linear mixing and
Kerker mixing parameters40 was employed
for calculations with the PBE0 hybrid functional. Moreover, the “number
of valence electrons” tag was used to define the number of
electrons in spin-polarized calculations of polaron formation energies.
One excess electron was added when studying electron polarons, and
one electron was removed from the system when investigating hole polarons.

Suitable Hubbard parameters were examined in the 4–10 eV
range for both electron and hole polarons. We used Dudarev’s
approach as implemented in the VASP.41 Although
on-site Coulomb (U) and exchange (J) parameter differences (U–J) are meaningful under this scheme, the VASP implementation effectively
sets the J value to zero. Therefore, the selected U value can be considered to be the effective U (Ueff). We applied on-site Hubbard U correction to titanium 3d orbitals and oxygen 2p orbitals
to simulate electron polarons and hole polarons, respectively. According
to the literature27 and our PBE0 hybrid
calculations, both anatase and brookite have a tendency to efficiently
produce hole polarons. Thus, hole polarons have higher polaron formation/trapping
energies than those of electron polarons in these materials. Higher
hole-polaron energies compared to electron-polaron energies were only
observed for a Hubbard U value of 8 eV for both polymorphs.
Hence, a Ueff of 8 eV was chosen to compare
energies using the DFT + U method. However, we would
like to emphasize that the U values presented here
may be valid only in the simulation using the VASP code, as the Hubbard
potential severely depends on the DFT code.42

Three basic calculations were performed for all defect-free
supercells.
First, each supercell was optimized with the PBE-GGA functional. Next,
the calculation was switched to accommodate the PBE0 range-separated
hybrid functional and reoptimized from the PBE-GGA functional parent
orbitals. However, we did not optimize the cell parameters at this
step and only ionic relaxation was computed. During the third step,
an electron (or a hole) was added to the supercell. Here, we did not
additionally attempt to localize the electron (or the hole) by introducing
defects around the respective atom to form a precursor potential.
Thus, all the localized polarnic states spontaneously occurred during
optimization. In this step, we first computed the delocalized polaron
on the nonrelaxed geometry (Edeloc,nonrelax), after which those structures were fully optimized to obtain localized
polarons in the relaxed geometry (Eloc,relax). We performed the same number of steps in the DFT + U method with the respective Ueff value.
Hence, the polaron formation/trapping energy was calculated using
the following equation.24,29,43 1  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Equilibrium Structures
The model
structures used in this study are displayed in Figure 1, and all of the bond lengths and lattice
constants are listed in Table 1 for unperturbed supercells that were investigated with the
PBE (GGA level of theory) and hybrid PBE0 functionals. Hence, our
results can be compared with the available experimental data to validate
our models. Both the PBE- and PBE0-functional calculated structural
parameters and interatomic Ti–O bond distances of brookite
and anatase are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally.

(Ti–O) bond lengths are listed. For brookite all four equatorial

3.2 Bandgaps
Initial attempts to calculate
the bandgap of brookite using theoretical techniques were reported
by Grätzel and coworkers,45 who
used the extended Hückel molecular orbital theory. They calculated
bandgaps of 3.14, 3.23, and 3.02 eV for brookite, anatase, and rutile,
respectively, which revealed that brookite has a gap value that lies
between those of the other two polymorphs of titania. The bandgaps
were recently calculated using PBE, range-separated hybrid (HSE06),
and Green’s function-based quasiparticle (G0W0) approaches in the VASP code. The predicted energies of 1.86
eV (PBE), 3.30 eV (HSE06), and 3.45 eV (G0W0) for brookite are in very good agreement with those of an earlier
study;46 that study reported values for
anatase of 1.94 eV (PBE), 3.60 eV (HSE06), and 3.73 eV (G0W0). Therefore, brookite has a lower bandgap than anatase.
Experimentally determined bandgaps lie between 3.1 and 3.4 eV for
brookite,31 and the optical bandgaps of
brookite and anatase are 3.347 and 3.4
eV,48 respectively.

In this work,
the bandgap of brookite was determined to be lower than that of anatase
calculated using the PBE0 hybrid functional and the on-site Hubbard
potential (Figure 2). These results are in good agreement with the above mentioned literature49 and lend credibility to this study. The hybrid
functional with 25% exact exchange and an on-site potential value
of 6 eV provided a bandgap of ∼3.4 eV for brookite, which is
in good agreement with the experimental optical gap. The bandgap energy
of anatase is clearly higher in each case, and the energy value was
observed to increase linearly with increasing percentage of exact
exchange and on-site Hubbard potential. However, the difference between
the bandgap of brookite and anatase increased with increasing Hartree–Fock
percentage (% HF); these differences are calculated to be 0.20, 0.35,
and 0.37 eV for exact exchanges of 25, 30, and 35%, respectively,
which we attribute to the small lattice sizes of the titania polymorphs
that may be associated with quantum-confinement effects. Nevertheless,
the differences between the brookite and anatase bandgaps are calculated
to be minimal using the on-site Hubbard potentials; they range from
0.06 eV (U = 6 eV) to 0.19 eV (U = 10 eV). Except for a potential of 10 eV, these calculated bandgaps
also increase linearly with increasing the U value,
which is attributed to the higher bandgap opening because of the compellingly
higher on-site potential. The red and black dashed lines in Figure 2 indicate the literature
reported49 bandgaps from higher-level calculations
for anatase and brookite, respectively. The bandgaps are within the
expected range for large supercell calculations.

the (a) PBE0 and (b) on-site Hubbard models.
Black dashed lines in (a) represent the literature reported bandgaps
(from ref (49)) calculated
using hybrid or GW methods for brookite, while the red dashed lines
represent literature reported bandgaps for anatase. Anatase has a
higher bandgap than brookite, in agreement with literature reports
and the experimentally determined optical bandgaps.

3.3 Polaron Geometries by Hybrid
DFT
It is a well-known fact that hybrid functionals can produce
both
localized and delocalized solutions for excess-electron and electron-deficient
structures.29 A percentage of exact exchange
(Hartree–Fock, HF) is applied to the simulation to stabilize
either the localized or delocalized state. Generally, a lower percentage
of exact exchange favors a delocalized solution and vice versa. This
is mainly because of the metastable nature of the localized solution
to the polaron structure at low % HF; hence structure optimization
leads to a delocalized solution. Nevertheless, the delocalized solution
becomes increasingly metastable with higher amounts of exact exchange
such that a localized solution is eventually found at the end of the
simulation. We examined anatase clusters with 25, 30, and 35% HF;
however, polarons (both electron and hole) were not formed in the
bulk unit cells (the bulk anatase structures with fully delocalized
electron and hole polarons can be found in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). This is attributed to
the system size, as it is commonly reported that polarons in anatase
are large and Fröhlich polarons are spread across several lattice
units. Therefore, at the higher concentration limit, excess trapped
electrons are metastable, which always leads to the delocalized solution.
This behavior is in agreement with the experimental observations reported
in the literature.50 In addition, Moser
et al.50 reported that photon adsorption
by ground-state anatase produces a large hole polaron with a radius
of 20 Å, which is dissociated throughout the lattice at a higher
electron density. Moreover, recent theoretical work reported that
polaron formation is unfavorable in a stoichiometrically perfect anatase
lattice, but is favored in rutile.24 Another
study reported that no localized solution exists for an excess-electron
anatase simulation even with an exact exchange of 30%.29 These authors reported that stable polaron structures
were only observed in anatase with large unit cells, and lattice relaxation
was observed to spread over more than four unit cells (∼15.2
Å). As opposed to anatase, brookite stoichiometric lattices with
48 atoms simulated in this work with the hybrid PBE0 functional produced
both electron and hole polarons.

3.3.1 Electron Polarons in
Brookite
The
excess electron in brookite tends to localize itself at two separate
Ti ions in the unit cell. The bond lengths are slightly affected by
the percentage of exact exchange employed; thus, they are weakly dependent
on the amount of exact exchange. We compared the results obtained
using the lowest (25% HF) and highest (35% HF) configurations to highlight
the above observation. The average Ti–O bond lengths and the
changes resulting from polaron formation are reported in Tables S1
and S2 of the Supporting Information for
both the hybrid and on-site Hubbard models, respectively. Figure 3 displays the electron-polaron
geometries obtained from the hybrid calculations. Axial or apical
bonds refer to the bonds linking the two positions that are collinear
with the central Ti ion, while equatorial bonds refer to the bonds
passing through the central Ti ion and are orthogonal to the axial
bonds. We use the above definitions to describe and differentiate
the bond-length variations observed during polaron formation in this
work. Lattice relaxation was observed throughout the brookite in the
[100] and [010] directions of the supercell (∼18.33 Å).
However, the longest bond from Ti to an equatorial oxygen (Ti–Oeq), was lengthened by +0.06 Å (and +0.07 Å) with
respect to that of the unperturbed structure at 25% (and 35%) exact
exchange. The shortest Ti–Oeq bond was contracted
by −0.04 and −0.05 Å at 25 and 35% exchange, respectively,
whereas the longest bond from Ti to an axial oxygen (Ti–Oa) was minimally perturbed and the shortest Ti–Oa bond was elongated by +0.02 and +0.03 Å at 25 and 35%
exact exchange, respectively.

Figure 3 Hybrid-functional calculated brookite supercells
with electron
polarons calculated at (a) 25 and (b) 35% exact exchange. Note that
the electron polaron is localized on two Ti ions and the electron-polaron
wavefunction is delocalized over other Ti ions. Color scheme: blue,
titanium; red, oxygen; yellow, polaronic wavefunction at an isosurface
value of 0.003 e/Bohr3. Ti–O bond distances are
reported for equatorial (Oeq) and axial (Oa)
oxygen bonds at the polaronic site and away from it (see Table S1).

Ti–O bond-length variations measured away from the
localized
polarons are ranged between +0.02 and −0.02 Å; hence,
these bond lengths are only slightly different to those of the unperturbed
geometry. We conclude, therefore, that no fully localized electron
polaron is formed at other Ti ions. On the basis of the more delocalized
nature of the electron-polaron wavefunction in the brookite lattice
(except in the two fully localized states), we believe that both localized
and delocalized states coexist in this lattice. However, we observed
a delocalized polaronic solution even at the highest exact exchange
used (35%) in this study. Therefore, a more stable localized solution
must be obtainable at higher exact exchanges (40% or above); however,
the electron polaron can also be artificially localized at higher
exact exchanges,29 therefore we did not
attempt to apply a higher % HF. Nevertheless, the polaron formation
energies were determined to be negative; therefore electron polarons
are even stable in these supercells. Furthermore, the Ti–O
bond lengths increase in the direction of the a-lattice
constant (9.166 Å), while they decrease in the direction of the c-lattice constant (5.135 Å), which provides a certain
level of anisotropy to the coordination environment at the charge-localization
center.

3.3.2 Hole Polarons in Brookite
Looking
at the polaronic wavefunction, it is clear that four hole polarons
are localized at four oxygen atoms in brookite (Figure 4a,b). They are more pronounced, and three
localized wavefunctions are observed at two-coordinated oxygen sites,
with one localized at a three-coordinated oxygen site. Unlike for
the electron polaron, the longest axial Ti–O bond length decreased
by −0.03 and −0.04 Å using 25 and 35% exact exchange,
respectively, with respect to the unperturbed structure. The shortest
Ti–Oa bond increased by +0.04 and +0.05 Å,
respectively, using 25 and 35% exact exchange. The equatorial bonds
are distorted between +0.01 and −0.02 Å; hence, the equatorial
Ti–O bonds are less affected in the hole-polaron structure.
The Ti–O bond lengths increase asymmetrically at the hole-polaron
site. At the two-coordinated oxygen sites, variations between +0.01
and +0.05 Å were observed, while variations between +0.01 and
+0.06 Å were observed at the three-coordinated oxygen site.

Figure 4 Brookite-supercell
hole-polaron structures calculated using the
hybrid functional with (a) 25 and (b) 35% exact exchange. Holes are
localized on four oxygens, mainly the two-coordinated and three-coordinated
oxygen ions. Color scheme: blue, titanium; red, oxygen; yellow polaronic
wavefunction at an isosurface value of 0.003 e/Bohr3. Ti–O
bond distances are provided for equatorial and axial oxygen bonds
at the polaronic site and away from it (see Table S1).

The hole-polaronic wavefunctions
are fully localized on the oxygen
ions. Therefore, brookite is able to produce a fully localized hole
polaron in its bulk structure, which is in agreement with the recent
work of McKenna and coworkers,27 who reported
hole-polaron formation in brookite; however, no electron polarons
were observed. The lack of electron polarons can be attributed to
the coexistence of localized and delocalized solutions, as observed
in this study. The brookite electron- and hole-polaron structures
exhibit similar scale lattice distortions that are spread across the
entire lattice. Moreover, the electron-polaron geometry of brookite
exhibits equatorial Ti–O bonds that are significantly distorted,
while the two axial Ti–O bonds are significantly affected in
the hole-polaron geometry; three bonds increase in length and three
bonds decrease in length in the direction of the a-lattice vector (a = 9.166 Å), which induce
anisotropy in the [100] direction.

3.4 Polaron
Geometries by DFT + U
The on-site Hubbard
model is popular in the literature
due to its low computational cost and convenience for tuning the properties
of interest. However, it has an inherent drawback, namely that all
properties of interest cannot be simulated with a single Hubbard on-site
potential value.21,22 In addition, it depends heavily
on the implementation in the DFT code.42 Thus, we cannot directly compare the absolute values of U, which are taken from different DFT codes. Nevertheless,
it can be used as a reasonable model for qualitatively comparing results
with those from available theoretical or experimental studies. From
the literature reported values of the on-site Hubbard parameter, U values from 4.0 eV24 (VASP)
to 10 eV22,23 (VASP, CP2K) have been tested for anatase
and brookite. Both electron and hole polarons are observed for brookite
at U = 6 eV; however, both electron and hole polarons
are observed for anatase at U = 8 eV. Nonetheless,
an anatase hole polaron has also been observed at U = 7 eV. Therefore, bulk brookite may arguably form polarons rather
more easily than bulk anatase. The brookite hole-polaron geometry
was better reproduced at U = 6 eV when compared to
that obtained from the PBE0 study, while the electron polaron was
always fully localized on a single Ti atom, in contrast to that observed
in hybrid calculations.

3.4.1 Electron Polarons in
Brookite
Figure 5 shows both electron-
and hole-polaron geometries obtained from Hubbard on-site potential
calculations. The electron polaron is fully localized at a single
Ti atom in brookite. The four equatorial Ti–O bonds and the
two axial Ti–O bonds are elongated from the Ti center. The
axial Ti–O bonds lengthen by about +0.16 Å (for the shortest
bond) and +0.02 Å (for the longest bond). The longest axial bond
seems to be resistant to change, and is minimally distorted, as was
observed using the hybrid functionals. The equatorial Ti–O
bonds lengthen by between +0.13 and +0.02 Å; therefore, all six
bonds that form Ti octahedra dramatically change upon polaron formation.
The structure stretches in the a- and c-lattice vector directions, while the b-lattice
vector direction maintains the minimum distance. Hence, both the hybrid-functional
and Hubbard models predict anisotropy in the electron polarons. Lattice
relaxations are observed throughout the unit cell, as was observed
in the hybrid functional study.

with U =
6.0 eV: (a) electron and (b) hole-polaron structures. Note that the
electron polaron is localized on a single Ti ion, whereas holes are
localized on four oxygen ions. Color scheme: blue, titanium; red,
oxygen; yellow, polaronic wavefunction at an isosurface value of 0.003
e/Bohr3. Ti–O bond distances are recorded for equatorial
and axial oxygen bonds at the polaronic site and away from it (see Table S2).

3.4.2 Hole Polarons in Brookite
The brookite
hole-polaron geometry predicted by DFT + U is remarkably
similar to that calculated with the PBE0 hybrid functional at 35%
exact exchange. The hole-polaron structure is comparatively minimally
distorted from the unperturbed structure. One of the axial Ti–O
bonds with the shortest length was observed to increase (+0.04 Å),
while the longest Ti–Oa bond was observed to decrease
(−0.02 Å). Between the equatorial Ti–Oeq bonds, two bonds increase in length (+0.03, +0.01 Å) and two
decrease in length (−0.02 Å), which clearly induces anisotropy
in the a-lattice vector direction, and provides a
hole-migration path in the [100] direction. This reflects the recent
experimental brookite literature, in which authors have reported the
[210], [201], and [101] facets to be highly active surfaces for photocatalytic
activity.30 Thus, both the hybrid and Hubbard
models predicted anisotropy in the hole-polaron geometry in the a-lattice vector direction.

3.4.3 Electron
Polarons in Anatase
The
electron polarons in anatase are localized on three of the Ti ions
that are separated from each other (Figure 6). All exhibit axial Ti–O bond lengths
that increase asymmetrically by +0.04 and −0.08 Å. In
addition, two equatorial Ti–O bonds become longer by +0.02
Å, and the other two equatorial bonds become shorter by −0.01
Å around the polaron. These observations are in agreement with
the pioneering work of Deskins and Dupuis,21 who reported asymmetrically distorted bond lengths around the electron-polaron
structure of anatase at U = 10 eV (VASP). Because
of the shortening of the bonds in the b-lattice vector
direction (b = 3.776 Å), the lattice relaxation
in the [010] direction is small, with the highest lattice relaxation
observed in the c-lattice vector direction.

in (a) three electron polarons are localized on Ti ions, whereas in

distances are recorded for bonds to equatorial and axial oxygens at
the polaronic site and away from it (see Table S2).

3.4.4 Hole
Polarons in Anatase
The anatase
hole polaron is localized on a two-coordinated oxygen atom; however,
its wavefunction is mainly localized on a single oxygen ion. At higher U (10 eV), the hole polaron is localized on a three-coordinated
oxygen site. Thus, we believe that a higher Hubbard on-site potential
(U = 10 eV, VASP) was applied by Deskins and Dupuis,22 which resulted in a fully localized solution
on the three-coordinated oxygen atoms, while lower Hubbard potential
values localize the hole onto two-coordinated bridging oxygens. One
equatorial Ti–O bond at the hole polaron is significantly elongated
(+1.00 Å), with the other diametrically opposite Ti–Oeq bond contracts by about 0.09 Å. As a consequence, the
Ti ion adjacent to the hole polaron is significantly displaced. Consequently,
the highest lattice relaxation is observed in the direction of the a-lattice vector. However, the other two equatorial bonds
stretch by +0.01 Å and the smallest distortions are observed
in the b-lattice vector direction. In contrast to
its electron polaron, the hole-polaron structure of anatase exhibits
reduced lengths for both axial Ti–O bonds (−0.01 Å)
at all polaron sites. The bond lengths stretch at the hole-polaron
site (the two-coordinated oxygen atom site) by +1.00 and +0.05 Å.

3.5 Polaron Formation Energies by Hybrid DFT
Figure 7 compares
the electron- and hole-polaron formation energies calculated using
the PBE0 hybrid functional for brookite and anatase. Black bars represent
electron-polaron formation energies, while red bars show hole-polaron
formation energies. Depending on the % HF, the formation energies
increase for both electron and hole polarons, as expected. Brookite
and anatase both have higher hole-polaron formation energies compared
to their electron-polaron formation energies. The energies for the
formation of brookite hole polarons are ∼1.6 times higher than
those for the formation of electron polarons for all % HF values.
Hence, there is a strong driving force for the formation of hole polarons,
the bulk structures of these exotic materials rather than electron
polarons. An increase in the exact exchange, from 25 to 35%, results
in an increase in the polaron formation energy of approximately 0.01
eV for these brookite supercells. All of the energetics presented
here are reported per polaron, as different numbers of electron and
hole polarons are formed.

Figure 7 Polaron formation energies of (a) brookite and
(b) anatase calculated
by PBE0. Because of delocalization of the polarons in anatase, their
energies are an order of magnitude lower than those of brookite. Note
these energies are reported per polaron.

Although anatase produces a delocalized solution for the
bulk structures
studied in this work, it is worth comparing the energetics in order
to get a better understanding of these systems. Here, anatase polaron
formation energies for the delocalized solution are calculated as
the energy difference between Edeloc,nonrelax and Edeloc,relax. Nevertheless, the
delocalized polaron energies reveal that anatase has a higher hole-polaron
forming ability, as expected from previous studies.25,27

According to the literature, a 6 × 6 × 1 anatase
unit
cell with 432 atoms has an electron-polaron formation energy of −0.1
eV.29 Therefore, unit cells with 48 atoms
should have very small electron-polaron formation energies. All calculated
anatase electron-polaron formation energies are less than −0.01
eV, which further validates our approach. Hole-polaron formation energies
are comparatively larger than electron-polaron formation energies.
Therefore, the driving force to produce hole polarons in anatase is
also large. The hole-polaron formation energy using 35% exact exchange
is 2.8 times larger than the electron-polaron formation energy. In
addition, a recent study on rutile and anatase found that rutile exhibited
the maximum photocatalytic ability at a particle size of 2.5 nm, whereas
5 nm anatase particles exhibited the maximum photocatalytic ability.11 Consequently, this study further supports the
observation that anatase does not produce localized electron or hole
polarons that catalyze reactions at this unit cell size. Therefore,
anatase is unable to reach its optimum ability with particles of small
sizes. In contrast, brookite produces both electron and hole polarons
at this unit cell size; hence, we can infer size-dependent photocatalytic
behavior for brookite as well as anatase. Therefore, the delocalized
polaronic energies in anatase shed light on its photocatalytic properties.
A comparison of the electron and hole polarons of brookite with those
of anatase at the high-concentration limit predicted using the hybrid
functional reveals that the driving force to produce polarons in brookite
is larger than that in anatase.

3.6 Polaron
Formation Energies by DFT + U
Brookite produces
both electron and hole polarons
at U = 6 eV; however, the brookite electron polaron
is always localized on a single Ti ion, whereas the hole polaron is
dispersed at four oxygen ions in the unit cell, except at U = 8 and 10 eV. Therefore, with the exception of U = 8 and 10 eV, the energy per polaron in a unit cell is
much lower for hole polarons (see Figure 8). At these higher on-site potentials, the
hole polaron tends to be mainly localized on a single oxygen ion (see Figure S2c); as a result, the energy trend expected
using hybrid functionals is observed. However, anatase does not form
electron polarons at U = 6 and 7 eV; electron and
hole polarons form at U = 8 eV, and at higher values,
the electron-polaron formation energy becomes much larger than the
hole-polaron formation energy. The electron and hole polarons in anatase
tend to both be localized on single ions at an effective on-site Hubbard
potential of 10 eV (see Figure S2a,b).
This difference is ascribable to the differences between the on-site
Hubbard Coulomb potential and the Hartree–Fock functional.
Hartree–Fock is an external potential in which all electrons
in the system “feel”, whereas the Hubbard on-site potential
is applied only to a predefined set of electrons (d electrons for
the titanium electron polaron and p electrons for the oxygen hole
polaron). It seems that the on-site Hubbard potential tends to affect
the energetics of the d electrons on titanium considerably more than
the p electrons on oxygen. Consequently, the higher influence of the
Hubbard on-site potential is reflected in the higher formation energies
of the electron polarons. This influence is observed in both the brookite
and anatase polymorphs. Only an on-site Hubbard potential of 8 eV
reproduced the results obtained using the hybrid functional. At that
value of on-site potential, brookite exhibits roughly six-times higher
formation energies for both electron and hole polarons than anatase.
Consequently, brookite has a higher ability to produce both types
of polarons, in agreement with the hybrid-level results. Hence, the
recently observed higher photocatalytic properties of the brookite
polymorph are due to its superior ability to efficiently produce both
types of polaron.

Figure 8 Polaron formation energies of (a) brookite and (b) anatase
using
the on-site Hubbard model. (a) Single hole-polaron formation was observed
with Hubbard U values of 8 and 10 eV, whereas in
(b) the electron polarons of anatase continuously gain energy with
increasing Hubbard U value. Note these energies are
reported per polaron.

4 Conclusions
We presented electron-
and hole-polaron geometries of brookite
and anatase and their energetics using the hybrid PBE0 functional
and on-site Hubbard potential method. The hybrid functional predicts
that the electron and hole polarons formed in anatase are not localized.
In contrast, brookite forms both electron and hole polarons. Despite
this, the brookite electron-polaronic solution has coexisting localized
and delocalized states. Hole polarons are dispersed mainly on two-coordinated
oxygen ions; however, they are more pronounced and only the localized
solution exists. The Hubbard on-site potential was tested for a wide
range of U values (4.0–10 eV), which revealed
that brookite polarons are formed at U = 6 eV and
anatase polarons are formed at U = 8 eV. The brookite
electron polaron was found to always be localized on a single titanium
ion, whereas the hole polaron is dispersed on four oxygen atoms, as
was observed in the PBE0 studies. In brookite, hole-polaron structures
comparable to those predicted using the hybrid functional are observed
at an on-site potential of 6 eV. The anatase electron polaron is dispersed
at lower on-site potentials, but becomes localized with increasing
potential. The electron and hole polarons were found to be localized
on single titanium and oxygen ions, respectively, at 10 eV. The hybrid-functional
and DFT + U methods provided the most comparable
results for anatase and brookite only at an 8 eV on-site potential.
Both methods clearly predict that brookite has a higher polaron-producing
driving force than anatase. This work supplements the void in the
literature concerning brookite electron- and hole-polaron geometries
and energetics, and provides a plausible explanation for the higher
photocatalytic activity of the brookite polymorph. Furthermore, this
study provides a starting point for upscaling the system size using
the more versatile Hubbard method in order to better understand the
relationship between the structures and properties of these exotic
materials.
