The
cleavage of a permethylated α-cyclodextrin, that is,
purity and chemical yield of a maltohexaose derivative thus obtained,
was decisively affected by the reaction time. The matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry spectra
with synthetic data enable us to improve the cleavage reaction more
efficiently. The optimized conditions developed in the present study
allow us to cleave the permethylated γ-cyclodextrin to afford
a
maltooctaose derivative as a new synthetic building block in a high
chemical yield.

Introduction
Cyclodextrins (CDs)
are supramolecular cyclic hosts composed of
six to eight α-(1,4)-linked d-glucopyranose units,
that is, α-, β-, and γ-CDs, and are well-known to
bind organic/inorganic guest molecules in a hydrophobic truncated
cavity.1−3 To impart new functionalities toward CDs, the modification
of primary and/or secondary rims of CDs has progressively been demonstrated
as a rather straightforward strategy. For instance, rim-modified CDs
were reported for chemosensors, biomimetic enzyme models, and supramolecular
materials.4−10 The modification of the CD skeleton itself is likely to be an alternative
to the conventional counterpart because such a change of the skeleton
size and shape unambiguously provides different complexation abilities
compared to those obtained from native CDs. Nevertheless, only little
attention has been paid to such a skeleton modification because of
the inherently extensive synthetic steps.11−19

Of the limited approaches to the skeleton modification hitherto
examined, as shown in Figure 1, Kida and Akashi et al. have demonstrated the cleavage of
permethylated α-CD (1a) and the subsequent insertion
of aromatic spacers into the permethylated α-CD skeleton.17,19 They also performed the cleavage of 1a or permethylated
β-CD (1b) and the subsequent cyclization through
one β-(1,4)-glucosidic bond formation.18 The stability constants and inclusion selectivities of the aromatic
guest molecules with both the skeleton-modified CDs were remarkably
changed, compared to those obtained by using the corresponding nonmodified
permethylated α- or β-CD.17−19 Thus, a synthetic key
step for the creation of such structurally interesting skeleton-altered
CDs is the cleavage of the permethylated CD, as shown in Figure 1, and the maltohexaose
(2a) and -heptaose (2b) thus obtained by
the cleavage are obviously promising building blocks. In synthesizing
a skeleton-altered CD, we found that the purity of 2a plays a significant role in the insertion of an aromatic spacer
into the permethylated CDs. Although the purity by cleavage is thought
to be sensitive to the reaction time, it varies from 42 h to 6 days,17−19 and hence a slight low purity of 2a critically hampered
the insertion reaction.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of permethylated α-,
β-, and γ-CDs
and the cleavage of permethylated CDs; the red circle shows a glucose
unit related to a gradual cleavage.

In the present study, to thus obtain purer malto-oligosaccharides
as building blocks, we elaborated the cleavage reaction and also intended
to expand the range of its cleavage to permethylated γ-CD (1c). The results are discussed to elucidate the factors controlling
the cleavage reaction of the permethylated CDs.

Results and Discussion
At first, to construct a ring-expanded permethylated CD analogue
through cyclization of 2a with an aromatic spacer unit,
we followed the previously reported cleavage method,17−19 and thus 1a was treated with a 30% HClO4 aqueous solution at room temperature for 96 h to afford 2a in 48% yield (see General Procedure in the Experimental
Section). The compound 2a thus obtained by this
procedure was employed for further cyclization with a chromophoric
spacer, but the cyclization was strongly disfavored, nevertheless
a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum of
the compound 2a showed a satisfactory agreement with
the literature values.17−19 This result suggests that a proper purity of 2a was inherently unclear only by means of NMR spectroscopic
analysis because of the overlapping of multiple 1H NMR
peaks in the aliphatic sugar regions (e.g., see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

This fact prompted
us to subject the compound 2a (obtained
for 96 h) to a more sensitive matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis, the data
of which have not been examined in detail in the literature. As shown
in Figure 2e, the main
peak of 1265 is assignable to the molecular ion (m/z, [M + Na]+). Intriguingly, the peak
gradually decreases to 1061, 857, and 653 at regular intervals of
204, which can be attributed to the glucose unit at the end in the
structure of 2a, in the red circle of Figure 1.

Figure 2 MALDI-TOF-MS spectra
of the isolated compound 2a obtained
by the acid-based cleavage for (a) 5, (b) 10, (c) 24, (d) 40, (e)
96, and (f) 144 h.

As discussed below, these
gradual changes occurring at even intervals
are not because of the fragmentation of the main peak but of the further
cleavage of 2a (6-mer) to lower homologues as 5-, 4-,
or 3-mer, although the exact cleavage sequence from either end of 2a is not known at this time. Thus, this
current cleavage protocol gives indeed 2a with complex
malto-oligosaccharide mixtures, which make us practically hard to
purify in spite of severe chromatographic separation and sometimes
cause the incomplete cyclization with aromatic spacers.

As the use of 30% aq
HClO4 for the cleavage of permethylated
CDs was more efficient than Ac2O-concd H2SO4 or Ac2O-70% aq HClO4 for other CD derivatives,11,15,17 the reaction time is a critical
controllable factor without changing the acid reagent. To thus elucidate
the factors that control such a cleavage reaction of permethylated
CDs in 30% aq HClO4, we performed the cleavage of 1a under the same conditions, except for changing only the
reaction times to 5, 10, 24, 40, and 144 h, and the results were compared
with those obtained for 96 h. The peaks of 3- to 5-mers relative to
the product peak in Figure 2a–d are smaller and those observed in Figure 2f are clearly larger than those
obtained for 96 h in Figure 2e, undoubtedly indicating that further cleavage proceeded
by extending the reaction time. To quantitatively analyze these MS
peaks with the synthetic data, the relative ratios for MS peak intensities
and isolated and recovery yields are listed in Table 1.

b The ratios were determined by comparing
the peak intensities as 1 for 2a in the MALDI-TOF-MS
spectra without taking into account the difference in the ionization
efficiency.

c Not observed.

d Not obtained.

The isolated yields gradually increased
from 33% for 5 h to 52%
for 24 h with an appropriate recovery of 1a and eventually
reached constants of 48–50% for 40–144 h without the
recovery of 1a because of the consumption of lower homologues.
The relative peak ratios of 3- to 5-mers ranged from 0.07 to 0.11
for 5–24 h, and the prolonged time drastically increased the
ratios from 0.29, 0.38, and to 5. These results suggest that the cleavage
reaction was completed in 24 h, and hence the purity and the chemical
yield of 2a obtained in the optimized reaction time of
24 h were critically improved. The purity including the lower homologues
of 38% by the previous method was enhanced up by reducing down to
7% for lower malto-oligosaccharide mixtures, enabling the cyclization
of 2a with the aromatic spacers. As the isolated and recovery
yields were 52 and 24%, respectively, the proper yield based on the
consumed 1a was also up to 68% compared to the yield
of 42% reported previously.17

The
optimized reaction time was also subjected to the cleavage
of 1b, and thus 1b was treated with 30%
aq HClO4 at room temperature for 24 h to afford a purer
form of 2b in 46% isolated and 30% recovery yields; in
contrast, the reaction time in the previous report was 144 h18 which may give further lower homologues. For
constructing a much expanded supramolecular cyclic host, the cleavage
of 1c is of particular significance, which has not been
demonstrated yet. It is to note that our cleavage protocol was easily
applied to the cleavage of 1c under the same conditions
to give the corresponding maltooctaose derivative 2c in
a high 70% isolated yield.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
revealed that the reaction time for the
cleavage of permethylated CDs critically affects the purity of malto-oligosaccharide
scaffolds. It is noteworthy that the optimized condition was applicable
to permethylated γ-CD, the cleavage of which was attainable
for the first time. The promising building blocks, that is, malto-oligosaccharides
as the purer form, developed in this study may be expandable to the
creation for various supramolecular CD-based hosts. Further insertion
reactions of aromatic spacers using these purer malto-oligosaccharides
are currently in progress.

Experimental Section
General
The melting
point was measured with a Büchi
B-545 apparatus. The MS spectra were obtained by using a Bruker MALDI
autoflex. The 1H (400 MHz) and carbon nuclear magnetic
resonance (13C NMR) spectra (150 MHz) were recorded in
CDCl3 on a JNM-AL400, JNM ECS400, or Bruker ADVANCE II-600.
The permethylated α-CD was supplied from Osaka Dental University.
The permethylated β- and γ-CDs were synthesized as reported
previously.20

General Procedure for the
Cleavage of Permethylated α-CD
A given amount of permethylated
α-CD 1a was
thoroughly dissolved in H2O by sonicating in a flask. An
amount equal to the added water of a 60% HClO4 aqueous
solution was added slowly to the stirred solution, and the resulting
solution was stirred for various times at room temperature. The solution
was neutralized with a NaOH aqueous solution, and the resultant was
extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous
MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column
chromatography (2:1 hexane/acetone–1:1 hexane/acetone) gave
the desired maltohexaose derivative 2a as a white solid.

of the Maltohexaose Derivative (2a)
Permethylated
α-CD 1a (4.00 g, 3.26 mmol) was
thoroughly dissolved in H2O (127 mL) by sonicating in a
flask. A 60% HClO4 aqueous solution (127 mL) was added
slowly to the stirred solution, and the resulting solution was stirred
for 24 h at room temperature. The solution was neutralized with a
NaOH aqueous solution and the resultant was extracted with chloroform
(250 mL × 4). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography
(2:1 hexane/acetone–1:1 hexane/acetone) gave the desired maltohexaose
derivative 2a as a white solid (2.09 g, 1.68 mmol) in
52% yield with the recovery of 1a (951 mg, 0.776 mmol).
The NMR data showed satisfactory agreement with the literature values.18

Synthesis of the Maltoheptaose Derivative
(2b)
Permethylated β-CD 1b (4.00 g, 2.80 mmol) was
thoroughly dissolved in H2O (108 mL) by sonicating in a
flask. A 60% HClO4 aqueous solution (108 mL) was added
slowly to the stirred solution, and the resulting solution was stirred
for 24 h at room temperature. The solution was neutralized with an
NaOH aqueous solution and the resultant was extracted with chloroform
(200 mL × 3). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography
(2:1 hexane/acetone–1:1 hexane/acetone) gave the desired maltoheptaose
derivative 2b as a white solid (1.85 g, 1.28 mmol) in
46% yield with the recovery of 1b (1.22 g, 0.853 mmol).
The NMR data showed satisfactory agreement with the literature values.18

Synthesis of the Maltooctaose Derivative
(2c)
Permethylated γ-CD 1c (1.92 g, 1.18 mmol) was

to the stirred solution, and the resulting solution was stirred for
24 h at room temperature. The solution was neutralized with an NaOH
aqueous solution and the resultant was extracted with chloroform (200
mL × 3). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography
(2:1 hexane/acetone–1:1 hexane/acetone) gave the desired maltooctaose
derivative 2c as a white solid (1.37 g, 0.829 mmol) in
70% yield; mp 78–83 °C; HR-MS (MALDI-TOF) m/z: 1673.7957 ([M + Na]+, C72H130NaO41, calcd for 1673.7980); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δH 3.21–3.93
