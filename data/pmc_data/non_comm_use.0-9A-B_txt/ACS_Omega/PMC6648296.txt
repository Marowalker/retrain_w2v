Noble metals such
as Au, Ag, and Cu supported over semiconducting
ZnO are well-known heterogeneous oxidation catalysts. All of them
have been utilized for the oxidation of diesel soot with varied success.
However, Au-supported ZnO is seen to be superior among them. Here,
we present a comparative study of all these three catalysts for diesel
soot oxidation to explain why Au/ZnO is the best among them, demonstrating
the contribution of electronic states of metals in composite catalysts.
The electronic states of Cu, Ag, and Au determined by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy on 1 wt % Cu/ZnO, 1 wt % Ag/ZnO, and 1 wt % Au/ZnO catalysts
were correlated with their diesel soot oxidation activities. Although
all three catalysts present reasonable diesel soot oxidation activities
at relatively low temperature, 1% Cu/ZnO and 1% Ag/ZnO oxidize only
about 60% of the deposited diesel soot around 250 °C and 1% Au/ZnO
oxidizes 100% of the deposited diesel soot, at a temperature as low
as 230 °C. The activity of the catalysts is attributed to the
formation of stable M0–Mδ+ bifunctional
catalytic sites at the metal–ZnO interface, which enhances
the contact efficiency of solid diesel soot on Mδ+ and generates the superoxide species on M0 moieties.
The stability of the bifunctional M0–Mδ+ sites is controlled by the electronic interactions between the metal
(M) and n-type semiconductor ZnO at their interface. Very high activity
of 1% Au/ZnO is attributed to the presence of Au3+ at the
catalyst surface, which generates a stronger Coulombic force with
diesel soot electrons. We demonstrate a direct relation between the
diesel soot oxidation activity of these three metals and their electronic
states at the catalyst surface.

1 Introduction
There
is an increased demand of diesel-powered vehicles in recent
years, owing to their efficient energy conversion, higher durability,
and operation reliability, compared to gasoline-powered vehicles.1 However, emission of diesel soot from diesel
engines causes severe environmental and health problems to humans,
animals, and plants. The increasingly stringent U.S. and European
emission standards demand a drastic reduction in the emission of nitrogen
oxides and soot from diesel engines, which requires technical improvements
in the current diesel engines along with improved after-treatment
technologies.

One of the most effective after-treatment technologies
for diesel
soot control is based on a diesel soot filter, in which particles
are trapped.2 The filter has to be regenerated
periodically by the combustion of trapped soot. However, the direct
oxidation of soot requires higher temperatures (around 600 °C)
than the highest diesel engine exhaust gas temperature, which is around
400 °C for most of the diesel engines.3 Such a high temperature in the filter is generally attained by injecting
a diesel fuel into the exhaust, which results in additional fuel consumption
and thermal stress to the filter.

A catalyzed diesel soot filter
is regarded as the best solution
to reduce the soot emissions from diesel engines. In these filters,
soot is trapped and simultaneously oxidized at exhaust gas temperatures
(∼400 °C).4 However, catalytic
soot oxidation is quite slow because of the large size of the soot
particles, which hardly diffuse into the catalyst micropores or mesopores.
Thus, the contact between the catalyst surface and the soot particles
is very low.5 An interesting solution to
this problem is the continuously regenerating trap (CRT), in which
the soot oxidation occurs at relatively lower temperatures.8 In this technology, NO is first oxidized to NO2 over a platinum catalyst. NO2 functions as a mobile
species, creating a catalyst–soot contact and lowering the
soot oxidation temperature. However, the use of CRT is severely restricted
because of the restriction imposed by diesel engine emission norms,
which demands a strong decrease of NOx emissions.

On the other hand, organometallic fuel additives
known as fuel-borne
catalysts (FBCs) can lower the soot oxidation temperature in soot
filters. In this technology, a catalyst-doped soot is formed during
combustion in diesel engines. However, the application of this technology
is strongly restricted because while the diesel soot oxidation temperature
is lowered, the FBCs are consumed continuously and the catalysts (metal
oxides) are accumulated as ash inside the filter.6,7

Some of the catalysts that show good catalytic performances in
diesel soot oxidation are based on a variety of active materials such
as transition metals, transition-metal oxides, alkaline metal oxides,
perovskites, rare earth oxides, and a mixture of two or more of them.9−13 One of the main catalytic functions of transition metals in oxidation
reactions is to transfer the oxygen species from their surface to
the reactants.14 Therefore, the activity
of these catalysts for oxidizing soot particles is the function of
their ability to activate oxygen and the contact probability between
the catalyst and the soot particles.15,18 In other words,
these catalysts must contain active sites for adsorbing and activating
O2 along with active sites for adsorbing diesel soot to
generate close contacts.16,17

In recent studies,
we have reported the diesel soot oxidation activity
of group IB metals such as Cu/ZnO, Ag/ZnO, and Au/ZnO deposited over
ZnO.19−21 The activity of diesel soot oxidation is seen to
vary drastically from one catalyst to the other. While Cu/ZnO and
Ag/ZnO present low activity for diesel soot oxidation, Au/ZnO is seen
to be very active for this reaction at temperatures as low as 230
°C. The unique fact common for all these three catalysts, noticed
through their X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, is
the presence of both metallic and ionic species at their surfaces.
The results of diesel soot oxidation study of the three catalysts
suggest that the catalytic reactions over them strongly depend on
the electronic states of the supported metals (Cu, Ag, and Au). The
difference in their electronic states is governed through the differences
in the electronic interactions of the metallic nanoparticles (NPs)
with ZnO at their interfaces. In this work, we present a comparative
study, unifying diesel soot oxidation results of all three catalysts,
to demonstrate how the electronic states of these noble metals control
the diesel soot oxidation behavior of metal–semiconductor nanocomposites.
The origin of different electronic states of the metals at the support
surface has been explained by considering their electronic interactions
with the support ZnO, which is an n-type wide band gap semiconductor.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Diesel Soot Characterization
Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectrum of the diesel soot
studied in this investigation is presented in Figure 1. The spectrum revealed characteristic absorption
peaks in the mid-infrared region. The characteristic signals of C–H
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of alkane and alkene-type
functional groups appeared at around 2950, 2920, and 2854 cm–1, respectively. The peak detected at around 1711 cm–1 can be assigned to the carbonyl C=O stretching in aromatic
and aliphatic aldehydes and ketones. The absorption band appeared
around 1548 cm–1 could be attributed to C=C
stretching of aromatics and alkenes. The absorption band revealed
around 1462 cm–1 corresponds to conventional coke.22,23 The signal appeared around 1360 cm–1 has also
been observed in activated carbon, graphite, and carbon black.24

Figure 1 FT-IR spectrum of the diesel soot collected on reference
ZnO from
the combustion vessel exhaust during the burning of diesel fuel.

The broad signal detected between
1250 and 900 cm–1 might be the result of overlapping
of the following peaks: C–O
stretching (1191 and 1070 cm–1), C–O–C
stretching (1121 cm–1), and C–C–O
stretching.22 The band detected at around
2360 cm–1 corresponds to CO2 adsorbed
on the catalysts.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
2.2.1 Surface Area Analysis
Specific
surface areas (Sg) of the catalysts were
determined from their N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
recorded at 77 K. The results obtained are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen,
all the freshly prepared catalysts revealed their very low specific
surface area.

Prepared Composite Catalysts

2.2.2 TEM Characterization
of the Catalysts
Representative transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of
1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Au/ZnO catalysts recorded after their
use in the diesel soot oxidation cycle are presented in Figures 2 and S1 (Supporting Information). As can be seen, while after use in
the diesel soot oxidation cycle, Au and Ag NPs of average (ca.) size
∼90 nm are formed over the ZnO surface, Cu NPs of wide size
dispersion (10–140 nm size range) were formed over the support.
The average (ca.) size of the Cu NPs was considerably smaller (∼53
nm) than the average size of Au and Ag NPs (Table 1).

Figure 2 Typical TEM images of the 1% Au/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO,
and 1% Cu/ZnO catalysts.

In Figure 2, we
can also see that both the gold and silver NPs are hemispherical in
shape. These NPs are attached to the support through their flatter
planes over a specific crystal orientation of the support crystallites.
These images suggest that the interfaces between Au or Ag NPs and
ZnO are in tight contact (shown by white arrows).

2.2.3 Diffuse Reflectance Spectra of 1% Au/ZnO,
1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Cu/ZnO Catalysts
Figure 3 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectra (DRS) of all the catalysts studied in this investigation.
Although the absorption spectrum of ZnO revealed a low absorption
in the visible spectral region with a sharp absorption below 400 nm,
the absorption in the visible spectral region is high for all the
three M/ZnO composites. The broad absorption bands peaked around 450
and 510 nm in the spectra of 1% Ag/ZnO and 1% Au/ZnO samples can be
associated with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of
the Ag and Au NPs formed in the respective composites.25−27 On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of the 1% Cu/ZnO catalyst
revealed a broad absorption signal between 550 and 650 nm, corresponding
to the SPR of metallic Cu particles and a broad hump spreading through
400–510 nm associated with the absorption of Cu+.28 In general, the onset of absorption
edge for all the composite catalysts remained close to 380 nm (Figure 3), which is close
to the absorption edge of the ZnO semiconductor.29 However, linear fits to the sharp absorption sections of
the spectra revealed that their band gap energy differs slightly.

Figure 3 UV–vis
DRS absorption spectra of ZnO, 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO,
and 1% Au/ZnO. The band edge positions of the composites are indicated
by thick dotted dashed lines and the maxima of the SPR absorption
bands are indicated by continuous arrows of respective colors.

As can be noticed, the absorption
band of the 1% Ag/ZnO catalyst
in the visible spectral range is exceptionally broad, covering almost
the whole part of the visible region (400–650 nm) with a maximum
at around 450 nm, which might be the result of overlapping the silver
surface plasmonic resonance signal with the σ–σ*
and n−σ* transition signals of Agn clusters, which appear in the 330–360 and 440–540
nm spectral range, respectively.25,26 It is important
to indicate that the band at 275 nm attributed to Ag42+ (produced from the dimerization of Ag2+) cannot be observed because of the overlapping of the broad absorption
signals spreading through 200 and 400 nm of ZnO.30,31

It is interesting to compare the absorption spectrum of pure
ZnO
with the spectra of the supported catalysts. As can be observed, the
absorption edges of ZnO, 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Au/ZnO are not
superposed. Although the absorption edge of the 1% Cu/ZnO and 1% Ag/ZnO
catalysts suffered a small shift toward lower wavelengths, the band
edge of the 1% Au/ZnO catalyst shifted toward higher wavelength.

These small shifts of band edge of the composite catalysts can
be explained by considering a probable interfacial electronic interaction
between the metals and the semiconductor support. The red shift (toward
lower energy) observed for the ZnO absorption edge in the 1% Au/ZnO
spectrum might be due to the electronic transfer from ZnO to Au NPs
at their interface. The blue shift (toward higher energy) of the band
edge detected for 1% Ag/ZnO and 1% Cu/ZnO samples might be caused
by the electron transfer occurred from the Ag or Cu NPs to the ZnO
support at their interface. Although an increase in electron population
in the conduction band (CB) of ZnO effectively increases its band
gap due to the Burstein–Moss effect, the opposite can take
place due to decrease in electron population at the CB of the semiconductor.32 These shifts are due to the interfacial electronic
interactions between the metals and ZnO. As the interfacial area is
a small region at the catalyst surface, the shifts of the band edge
are small, as expected. The results presented in Figure 3 also suggest the presence
of Cu, Ag, and Au in their ionic and metallic states, which was supported
by the results obtained from the XPS analysis of the catalysts, presented
in the next section.

2.2.4 XPS Characterization
of 1% Au/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO,
and 1% Cu/ZnO Catalysts
The capability of a catalyst to activate
oxygen is closely associated with its activity in oxidation reactions.
The electronic states of Cu, Ag, and Au supported on ZnO were determined
by XPS to determine the possible interactions between the catalysts
and oxygen during oxidation reactions. The binding energies (BEs)
for the core electrons and estimated metal/Zn atomic ratios of the
catalysts are presented in Table 2.

2.2.4.1 1% Cu/ZnO Catalyst
The identification
of both Cu+ and Cu0 copper species in solid
catalysts is difficult from XPS analysis alone. The BEs of the Cu
2p3/2 core-level emissions from Cu+ and Cu0 are essentially the same and are detected at about 1.4 eV
below that of Cu2+ ions.33 Therefore,
we analyzed their L3VV X-ray-induced Auger emissions (AEs)
to identify Cu+ and Cu0 in the 1% Cu/ZnO catalyst.
The Auger parameter (αA) was defined as 1  where hν is the energy
of the incident photon (1253.6 eV), BE Cu 2p3/2 is the
BE of the Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron, and BE CuL3VV is the L3VV Auger emission.

The CuL3VV Auger spectrum of 1% Cu/ZnO is dominated by
the ZnL3VV Auger peaks that appeared in the
same energy region as of CuL3VV. Nevertheless,
the peak fitting procedure allowed us to determine the CuL3VV contribution. In Figure 4, the core-level spectrum of the sample is
presented. In Table 2, the BEs of Zn 2p3/2 and Cu 2p3/2 levels,
the values of αA, and the Cu/Zn atomic ratios in
the catalyst are presented.

2.2.4.2 1%
Ag/ZnO Catalyst
The XPS spectrum
of 1% Ag/ZnO is displayed in Figure 5. The XPS estimated that the Ag/Zn atomic ratio (presented
in Table 2) is about
0.26. As it has been listed in Table 2, the Ag 3d5/2 emission band comprises two
components. The component located at around 367.3 eV corresponds to
Ag+ and the component at 368.3 eV corresponds to Ag0 electronic states.34−38 Our analysis revealed a high amount of Ag+ at the surface
of the catalyst. However, the catalyst was reduced during its preparation
in pure H2 at high temperature, suggesting the presence
of Ag0 at the surface of the catalyst. Now, the enthalpy
of formation of bulk Ag2O (−ΔHf = 7 kcal/mol) is very low. This value indicates that
the surface oxidation of Ag0 to Ag2O is hardly
possible under the present reduction conditions, or even in higher
temperatures of oxidation conditions.39 Notwithstanding, the XPS analysis revealed a high percentage of
Ag+ after catalyst reduction.

Figure 5 XPS spectrum of 1% Ag/ZnO.

2.2.4.3 1%
Au/ZnO Catalyst
From the XPS
analysis results of sample 1% Au/ZnO presented in Figure 6 and Table 2, we can see that the XPS spectrum of the
catalyst revealed the Au 4f7/2 emission band with three
components. These components are located at around 83.4, 85.6, and
88.0 eV and correspond to Au0, Au+, and Au3+ electronic states, respectively. The analysis revealed high
amounts of Au3+ (84%) with minor contributions of Au0 and Au+. The Au/Zn atomic ratio value at the surface
of the catalyst (Table 2) is about 0.19 only. This value indicates a low metal dispersion
and the formation of gold NPs of high average particle size, supporting
the observation made from the TEM micrograph of the sample (Figure 2).

Figure 6 XPS spectrum of 1% Au/ZnO.

2.2.5 Metal–Support
Interactions in 1%
Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Au/ZnO Catalysts
The XPS analysis
of electronic states of Cu, Ag, and Au in the catalysts revealed the
presence of metallic and ionic species at their surfaces. The presence
of these species can be explained by considering the energy level
alignment concept, correlating the interactions of Cu, Ag, or Au at
the interface with ZnO, which is an n-type semiconductor.

The
work function values of ZnO, Au, Ag, and Cu are presented in Table 3. ZnO presents a work
function value of 4.9 eV, which is higher than that of metallic Cu
(4.6 eV) and metallic Ag (4.26 eV). Because of the energy level alignment,
the Fermi level of Cu and Ag remains at higher level than that of
ZnO. Therefore, when in contact, the electrons migrate from copper
or silver to the CB of ZnO at their interface, to achieve the Fermi
level equilibration. The electron migration process causes a reduction
in the stability of metallic copper or metallic silver at the metal–support
interface.40,41 As revealed by XPS analysis (Table 2), the formation of
Cu+ or Ag+ results from the electron transfer
from metallic Cu or Ag to ZnO at the metal–support interface.
As can be observed in Table 3, although about 10% of Cu+ was revealed at the
1% Cu/ZnO surface, the presence of about 80% Ag+ was revealed
at the surface of the 1% Ag/ZnO catalyst. The strong difference between
Cu+ and Ag+ surface concentrations may be due
to the work function differences of Cu and Ag (Table 3). Indeed, Ag presenting a lower work function
value (4.2 eV) than that of Cu (4.6 eV) has a higher value of its
Fermi level energy than that of Cu. The transfer of electrons from
Cu to ZnO until the two systems attain equilibrium for the new Fermi
level to be established may be lower than the transfer of electrons
from Ag to ZnO, resulting in a higher concentration of Ag+ compared with the Cu+ concentration at the surface of
the catalysts.

Table 3 Work Function Values of the Different
Compounds in the Catalysts
compound	work function (eV)	
ZnO	4.9	
Cu	4.6	
Cu+	4.9	
Cu2+	5.9	
Ag	4.2	
Ag+	5.3	
Au	5.1	
Au+	 	
Au3+	 	
The work function of Au (5.1 eV) is a bit
higher than that of ZnO
(4.9 eV). Therefore, the Fermi level of ZnO remains at a bit higher
energy than that of gold. In this case, the electrons will migrate
from the CB of ZnO to Au at their interface to achieve the Fermi level
equilibration when they are in contact. The Fermi level equilibration
increases the stability of metallic gold at the Au–ZnO interface.40,41 The formation of very stable metallic Au0 results from
the electron transfer from ZnO to Au as revealed by XPS (Table 2).

XPS analysis
revealed high amounts of Au3+ (84%) with
minor contributions of Au0 and Au+. However,
the catalyst was reduced during its preparation in pure H2 at high temperature, justifying the presence of Au0 at
the surface of the catalyst. Moreover, TEM results revealed the presence
of large Au particles at the catalyst surface, which should behave
as bulk gold, which is rarely found in oxidized state. Now, as the
1% Au/ZnO catalyst was prepared using NaAuCl4 solution,
chloride traces might have remained despite the H2 reduction
at 450 °C. The presence of AuCl3 also cannot be discarded,
which would be responsible for the Au3+ contribution at
the catalyst surface. However, at the ZnO–Au interfacial region,
the electron transfer from ZnO to Au might have resulted in the formation
of metallic Au, despite the interactions between gold and chloride
in other regions of the catalyst.

The results obtained from
the DRS spectra of the composite catalysts
(Figure 2) support
these assumptions. The electronic transfer from copper and silver
to ZnO might have generated an enrichment of electrons in ZnO support,
which might have resulted in the blue shift of its band gap energy.
On the other hand, the electron transfer from ZnO to gold might have
generated a decrease in the electronic density of interfacial ZnO
molecules, resulting in the red shift of its band gap observed in
the absorption spectrum of 1% Au/ZnO.

2.3 Diesel
Soot Oxidation on the Catalysts
Generation of CO during diesel
soot oxidation reactions was not detected
in the studied soot oxidation conditions of this investigation (25–600
°C, 20 vol % O2), which might be due to the high oxidation
activity of 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Au/ZnO catalysts. The CO
oxidation rate might have been higher than the CO generation rate
during soot oxidation over the catalysts. Indeed, these results show
that the diesel soot reacts predominantly via the combustion reaction
at the very strong oxidation conditions in which the reaction is performed
(20 vol % of O2). Nevertheless, the evolutions of diesel
soot oxidation over ZnO at 25–800 °C revealed only trace
amounts of CO at about 500 °C.

The CO2 evolutions
during the diesel soot oxidation with temperature over the three catalysts
studied are displayed in Figure 7. From these curves, the Tinitial (temperatures at which the oxidation started), Tmax (temperatures when the oxidation reached a maximum),
and Tfinal (temperatures when the reaction
completed) were calculated for the three catalysts and presented in Table 4. As can be noticed
from Figure 7 and Table 4, the diesel soot
oxidation activity of all the three catalysts takes place at temperatures
<400 °C.

Figure 7 Evolution of CO2 as a function of temperature
during
diesel soot oxidation over the catalysts.

a Calculated from

In Figure 7, CO2 evolution
during diesel soot oxidation deposited over reference
ZnO in between 25 and 800 °C is presented. In these reaction
conditions, the total area under the CO2 evolution curve
from 25 to 800 °C ([CO2]ZnO) was used as
a measurement of the highest amount of carbon in the diesel soot,
which was accumulated over the catalysts for 1 h. To compare the catalytic
activity of our three catalysts, the areas under the CO2 evolution curves, during the diesel soot oxidation over the catalysts
([CO2]Cat), were estimated and compared with
[CO2]ZnO. The calculated values of [CO2]Cat and [CO2]Cat/[CO2]ZnO are reported in Table 4. In the table, it can be seen that [CO2]Au/[CO2]ZnO (calculated for 1%
Au/ZnO) attained the highest value compared with the calculated values
for 1% Cu/ZnO and 1% Ag/ZnO. These results indicate that 1% Au/ZnO
is a very active and superior catalyst for diesel soot oxidation.
The appearance of intense and sharp signal (Figure 7) in 200–300 °C temperature range,
with a peak at 230 °C, indicates that the diesel soot deposited
during diesel combustion is probably fully oxidized at this low temperature.

2.3.1 Mechanistic Considerations of Diesel Soot
Oxidation over the Catalysts
The differences in the activities
presented by 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Au/ZnO for diesel soot oxidation
cannot be explained by the estimated specific surface area of the
catalysts. As can be seen in Table 1, all the three catalysts present a similar specific
surface area. On the other hand, the diesel soot oxidation activities
of the catalysts (Figure 7 and Table 4) cannot be explained neither by the differences in the average metal
NP size in them. Although the TEM images of 1% Ag/ZnO and 1% Au/ZnO
(Figure 2) revealed
the formation of metal NPs of very similar (∼88 nm for Ag and
89 nm for Au) average sizes in the composite catalysts, the gold-supported
catalyst manifests much higher diesel soot oxidation activity. On
the other hand, the 1% Cu/ZnO catalyst, containing metallic NPs of
about 53 nm average size, presents the same behavior as 1% Ag/ZnO
catalyst.

The catalytic behavior of the three catalysts cannot
be explained by the metal surface atomic concentration revealed by
XPS (Table 2). It can
be seen that the relative atomic ratio (M/Zn) decreases in the order:
Cu > Ag > Au. However, the [CO2]Cat/[CO2]ZnO ratio shown in Table 4 decreases in the order: Au > Cu >
Ag.

Therefore, to explain the exceptionally high diesel soot
oxidation
activity of 1% Au/ZnO at low temperature in comparison to 1% Cu/ZnO
and 1% Ag/ZnO, it is convenient to explain first the effects of 1%
Au/ZnO on the oxidation reaction. On the basis of the results of XPS
analysis of the catalyst surface, we propose a bifunctional catalytic
site consisting of neighboring Au0 and Au3+ (Au0–Au3+). The Au0 sites may be
located at the Au/ZnO interface and the Au3+ site at the
gold NP surface, in close proximity to Au0 (Figure 8). This site might have facilitated
the diesel soot oxidation following a Langmuir–Hinshelwood
reaction mechanism, according to the following steps:

Figure 8 Proposed catalytic site
model at the Au/ZnO surface.

2.3.1.1 First Step
At the Au/ZnO interface,
O2 was adsorbed on the Au0 moiety of the catalytic
site (Au0–Au3+) and superoxide ions (O2–) were generated. Superoxide species are
very active species for optimizing the oxidation of diesel soot.42−47

2.3.1.2 Second Step
The second step involves
simultaneous adsorption of diesel soot at the Au3+ moiety
of the catalytic site. The probability of the diesel soot adsorption
occurrence on the catalyst surface will increase with the number of
activated diesel soot molecules striking the surface. The striking
molecules, to be adsorbed, must carry a total energy equal to or greater
than the adsorption activation energy. The total energy ET of the diesel soot particle is considered to be the
sum of its kinetic energy EK (defined
by the kinetic theory of gases) plus its potential energy UC (generated by the Coulombic forces between
the π electrons of the C=C bonds present in the diesel
soot molecules and the Au3+ moiety of the catalytic site),
according to the following equation: 2  

The total energy of the diesel soot
particles being adsorbed at the Au3+ moiety can be expressed
as 3  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature,
3 stands for the charge number (oxidation state) of Au3+, kc is the Coulomb constant, e is the electric charge, and r is the
distance between the charges.

2.3.1.3 Third
Step
Reaction of the H–C
bond of the adsorbed diesel soot molecule at the Au3+ moiety
with the superoxide formed at Au0. This step may result
in the abstraction of H atoms by the very active superoxide ions.
The reaction between the superoxides formed over Au0 with
the adsorbed diesel soot at Au3+ would strongly increase
the rate of diesel soot oxidation. The successive, simultaneous interactions
of H–C bonds of the diesel soot molecule with O2– at the catalyst surface may result in the generation
of CO2 and H2O molecules (as the final products)
at low oxidation temperature.

For 1% Cu/ZnO and 1% Ag/ZnO, based
on their XPS analysis, we propose a similar catalytic site model at
the catalyst surface (Figures 9 and 10), involving Cu+ or
Ag+ at the Cu/ZnO or Ag/ZnO interfaces, and surface Cu0 or Ag0 sites in proximity to Cu+ or
Ag+. Developed bifunctional catalytic sites consisting
of [Cu+–Cu0] or [Ag+–Ag0] would facilitate the particle matter oxidation following
a similar mechanism at the bifunctional [Au0–Au3+] site.

Figure 9 Proposed catalytic site model at the Cu/ZnO surface.

Figure 10 Proposed catalytic site model at the
Ag/ZnO surface.

However, the adsorption
rate of diesel soot at the Cu+ or Ag+ moieties
of the proposed catalytic sites (step
2) would be much lower than the adsorption rate at the Au3+ moieties of the catalytic sites of 1% Au/ZnO. To provide a mathematical
justification of such assumption, we calculated the total energy ET value of each diesel soot molecule striking
the catalytic sites of copper or silver catalysts: 4   5  

The number 1 in eqs 4 and 5 stands for the electronic charge of
Cu+ and Ag+, respectively.

However, for
the same temperature, 6   7  because of the higher oxidation state
of Au3+.

The diesel soot particles, reacting on the
Au3+ moieties,
may attain the required adsorption activation energy at higher rates
than on Cu+ or Ag+, resulting in a higher adsorption
rate, which is the determining reaction step for diesel soot oxidation.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the results obtained on the IB group metal-supported
ZnO suggest that the diesel soot oxidation activity of metal-supported
metal oxide catalysts is determined by the presence of a metal catalytic
site involving M0–Mδ+ moieties.
Although the M0 moieties accelerate the generation of a
superoxide, the Mδ+ moieties accelerate the diesel
soot adsorption process. The diesel soot adsorption, which is the
rate-determining step in diesel soot oxidation process, can be accelerated
by increasing its Coulombic potential energy, generated by the Coulombic
forces between the π electrons of the C=C bonds present
in the diesel soot molecules and the ionic metal species Mδ+ on the metal NPs. Therefore, the diesel soot oxidation activity
of the supported catalysts depends on the number of electric charges
of metal ion moieties, which reside at the catalyst surface. We demonstrate
the effect of electronic state(s) of metals in metal-supported semiconducting
catalysts on their diesel soot oxidation ability. The proposed general
model can also be extended to other metal–semiconductor heterogeneous
oxidation catalysts. However, we must recognize that the oxidation
state of the supported metal over a semiconductor support depends
considerably on the process of their fabrication/synthesis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalysts Preparation
The support
used for the preparation of the catalysts was ZnO powder, supplied
by Aldrich (99.99%). The catalysts were prepared by impregnation,
using the required amounts of aqueous Cu(NO3)2 (Aldrich 99.99%), AgNO3 (Aldrich 99.99%), and NaAuCl4 (Aldrich 99.99%) solutions to obtain 1 wt % M/ZnO mixtures
(M = Cu, Ag, or Au). The suspensions were magnetically stirred at
25 °C for 1 h. The catalysts were recovered by filtration, washed
thoroughly to remove unreacted species (soluble sodium and chlorine),
and dried under magnetic stirring at 120 °C overnight. The resulting
powders were reduced under pure H2 at a volume flow rate
of 80 mL min–1 at 450 °C for 4 h. The temperature
of the furnace was increased at the rate of 10 °C min–1. The catalysts were cooled down to 25 °C under H2 flow, after which the samples were purged with a nitrogen flow for
30 min. The catalysts were then stored in dry conditions and designated
as 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and 1% Au/ZnO. A ZnO sample was prepared
in the same way to use as the reference.

4.2 Catalyst
Characterization
The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the catalysts were
measured using a BELSORP Mini-II (BEL, Japan) sorptometer, after degasification
at 400 °C for 2 h. The specific surface area (Sg) of the catalysts was determined from their N2 physisorptions at −196 °C, using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
analysis. The isotherms were recorded in the pressure range 0.0–6.6
kPa. The saturation uptake was determined using the technique of back
extrapolation of the linear portion of the isotherms to zero equilibrium
pressure.

A Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped
with an integrating sphere was used to obtain the DRS of the catalysts,
using BaSO4 as the standard reflectance sample.

XPS
spectra were recorded on freshly prepared 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO,
and 1% Au/ZnO samples using an ESCALAB 200R electron spectrometer
equipped with a hemispherical analyzer, operating in a constant pass
energy mode. For recording the XPS spectra of the catalysts, a monochromatic
Mg Kα emission (hν = 1253.6 eV) from
the X-ray tube operating at 10 mA and 12 kV was utilized. To get good
signal-to-noise ratios, the energy regions of the photoelectrons of
interest were scanned a number of times. The intensities of the emission
peaks were determined by integrating the area under each peak after
subtracting an S-shaped background and fitting the experimental peak
to Lorentzian/Gaussian curves (80% L/20% G). Utilizing the position
of C 1s signal, coming from adventitious carbon, which appeared around
284.9 ± 0.2 eV, the peak positions of the elements were referenced.

TEM (JEM 2100F microscope fitted with an INCA X-sight, Oxford Instruments),
operating at 200 kV accelerating voltage and line resolution of 0.14
nm, was used to characterize the Cu, Ag, and Au particle sizes for
each catalyst. Before the TEM analysis, the catalyst samples were
ground and suspended in ethanol. A drop of the suspension was then
mounted over a carbon-coated copper grid and the solvent was evaporated.
The periodic images of the structures on the electron micrographs
were analyzed using digital Fourier transformation.

4.3 Generation of Diesel Soot
In Figure 11, the schematics
of the system used for generating a diesel soot is presented. Pure
Mexican diesel was burned in a glass vessel (diesel burner) under
an air flow rate of 100 mL min–1 for 1 h. In this
investigation, for referring both the soluble and insoluble fractions
of the diesel emission, the term “diesel soot” is used.

Figure 11 Diagram
of the system used for studying the generation and catalytic
oxidation of diesel soot process. (1) Air; (2) diesel burner; (3)
reactor in a programmable furnace; (4) temperature controller; and
(5) gas chromatograph.

The diesel combustion emission from the exhaust of the vessel
was
directed to the catalyst sample, which was placed in a tubular quartz
reactor with an inner diameter of 1 cm. The reactor was placed in
a programmable furnace, as shown in Figure 11. The resulting contact between the diesel
soot generated in the glass vessel and the catalyst is considered
similar to the contact between the diesel soot generated from a real
diesel engine and the catalyzed soot filter. Therefore, the concept
of light mode or tight mode contact between the diesel soot and the
catalyst used in several research studies cannot be applied here.

A Bruker FT-IR spectrometer (Vertex 70) operating in the 800–4000
cm–1 spectral range was used for the characterization
of the soot generated during diesel combustion in the glass vessel.
The diesel combustion emissions were accumulated on ZnO for 1 h under
the same conditions. The FT-IR spectrum was recorded using a thin,
uniform KBr pellet prepared with 0.2 wt % of the diesel soot/ZnO mixture.

4.4 Diesel Soot Oxidation through Temperature-Programmed
Experiments
The performance of 1% Cu/ZnO, 1% Ag/ZnO, and
1% Au/ZnO catalysts for diesel soot oxidation was evaluated by temperature-programmed
oxidation of the diesel soot/catalyst mixtures. For this purpose,
after the diesel soot accumulation over the catalyst, weakly attached
combustion products were removed by air (20 vol % of O2 and 80 vol % of N2) flow of 100 mL min–1. This flow was maintained during the entire soot oxidation process.
The diesel soot/catalyst mixture was then heated from 25 to 600 °C
at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1.

In order
to monitor the reaction temperature along with the exothermic heat
of the diesel soot oxidation, a thermocouple was inserted into the
diesel soot–catalyst mixture. The diesel soot oxidation products
from the reactor were analyzed every 10 min using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph
provided with a thermo-conductivity detector to monitor the CO and
CO2 evolution at different temperatures. To determine the
catalytic effect, diesel soot oxidation was performed under the same
conditions using diesel soot/ZnO mixture as the reference at temperatures
between 25 and 800 °C.
