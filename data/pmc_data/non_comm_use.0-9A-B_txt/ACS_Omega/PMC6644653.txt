Zinc oxide is a low cost and practical
II–VI chemical material,
which is utilized to absorb silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) on zinc
oxide nanosheets (ZnO NSs). Using the Ag NP-decorated ZnO NSs can
improve the electrical characteristics of zinc oxide. Field electron
emission characteristics of ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO NSs indicate
the turn-on fields were 5.3 and 3.2 V/μm in the dark, whereas
the turn-on field were 4.3 and 2 V/μm under UV light, respectively.
In addition, the field electron emission characteristics of ZnO NSs
and Ag–ZnO NSs indicate the enhanced field enhancement factors
were 3002 and 3420 in the dark and 3276 and 4815 under UV light, respectively.

I Introduction
The field emission inter-related
electronic devices must have favorable
electron emission characteristics, mainly determined by their material
nanostructures. The excellent field emission properties provide high
conductivity, shrill-tip morphology nanostructures, high stabilities,
and low work function, as investigated. The various component material
nanostructures of the field emission inter-related electronic devices
have greatly attracted substantial attention, such as ZnO, SiC, CNT,
GaN, and graphene.1−5 Among these materials, zinc oxide (ZnO) was widely studied as a
result of its exhibiting excellent properties from electronic devices
and optoelectronic devices for application. It is well known that
ZnO has a wide band gap as a semiconductor and large exciton binding
energy of 3.37 eV and 60 meV, respectively, at room temperature.6 Generally, in the case of undoped material, the
ZnO exhibits n-type semiconductor properties, with a hexagonal wurtzite
structure, with the lattice constant a = 3.24 Å, c = 5.20 Å.7 Currently,
a variety of nanostructures of ZnO material have been developed, for
example, nanorods, nanowires, nanopins, nanotubes, nanoplates, nanodisks,
and nanosheets (NSs), by various method.8−14 On the other hand, various geometrical morphologies of ZnO nanostructures
have been developed by various grown methods, for example, hydrothermal
method, electrochemical deposition, chemical solution method, and
chemical vapor deposition.15−18 The chemical solution method to synthesize ZnO nanostructures
exhibits distinct advantages of uniform morphology, simple process,
homogeneous size, low temperature, and low cost. It is known that
the excellent field emission properties are attributed to high conductivity,
shrill-tip morphology nanostructures, high stabilities, and low work
function; hence, the NS structure was suitable for achieving excellent
properties in a field emission device. On the other hand, there are
many methods to ameliorate the field electron emission property of
emitters based on ZnO nanostructures, such as metal doping, exposing
with UV light, and decoration of nanoscale noble metal particles on
nanostructure surface.19−21

In this work, the emitter based on ZnO or Ag
nanoparticle (NP)-adsorbed
ZnO used glass substrate by low-temperature chemical solution method
is used so that complex manufacturing processes can be avoided and
give effect to lower costs. The field emission characteristics of
an emitter based on ZnO or Ag NP-adsorbed ZnO were researched. In
addition, the field emission characteristics and reliability in the
dark or on exposure to UV light of emitter based on ZnO or Ag NP-adsorbed
ZnO were also measured. The results of this article demonstrate that
decorating with Ag on ZnO nanostructured surface can enhance field
emission; moreover, the illumination by UV enhanced emission characteristics
from ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO NSs.

II Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a–d
reveals the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images
of ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs. The figures verify pure and Ag–ZnO
NSs were vertically grown and interwoven with each other on the glass
substrate. The average diameter and length of ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO
NSs were ∼16 and ∼20 nm and ∼1.82 and ∼1.83
μm, respectively. In the FE-SEM image, it can be observed that
the surface of ZnO NSs was effectively decorated with Ag nanoparticles
of around 120–180 Å. Figure 1e shows the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
images of Ag-adsorbed ZnO NSs, it can found that these NSs consisted
of 46.31, 52.31, and 1.36% of Zn, O, and Ag, respectively. The EDX
images can indicate that the ZnO NSs contain Ag NPs.

Figure 1 (a–d) reveals
the FE-SEM images and (e) shows EDX images
of ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs.

Figure 2 shows
the
photoluminescence spectra of the ZnO and Ag-adsorbed ZnO NSs. It can
be found that there are two emission bands of UV and visible region,
demonstrating a typical luminescence characteristic of ZnO. The ∼380
nm peak of UV emission can correspond with near band edge emission
and free-excitonic recombination. The ∼540 nm peak of visible
region emission can correspond with nature-generated defects or intrinsic
oxygen vacancies of ZnO structure. In addition, it can also be found
that the UV emission peak is much stronger and visible region emission
intensity was reduced by Ag particle adsorption on ZnO nanosheet surface.6

Figure 2 Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of pure ZnO
and Ag-adsorbed
ZnO NSs measured after excitation by a He–Cd laser at 325 nm.

Figure 3 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO NSs.
On the basis of JCPDS Card: 3601451, the result indicates that these
diffraction peaks correspond with (002), (102), (103), and (112).
The diffraction peak indicated the hexagonal wurtzite structures of
the ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO NSs. The (002) diffraction peak is relatively
higher than the other diffraction peaks; it can be indicated ZnO NSs
crystals mainly grow was along c-axis direction.
Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of Ag were found in Figure 3b. On the basis of JCPDS Card:
04-0783, the result indicates that the peaks conformed to (111) and
(200), meaning the Ag is successfully adsorbed into the ZnO structure.

Figure 3 (a, b)
show the XRD spectrum of ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO NSs.

Figure 4 shows the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (HR-TEM) images, and EDX spectroscopic images
of Ag–ZnO NSs. A sample locational with stochastically chosen
Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of the ZnO NSs. It can be
found that the surfaces display rugged of the Ag-adsorbed ZnO NSs
as a result of the Ag nanoparticle adsorption on the surface; moreover,
the average diameter of Ag nanoparticles was around 6–9 nm.
From the mapped images of Ag-decorated ZnO NSs, it can found that
the Zn, O, and Ag atoms were evenly scattered at all places. The Ag-decorated
ZnO NSs detail 12.116 atom % Ag, as determined in the EDX spectrum;
this can further indicate that the Ag nanoparticles were adsorbed
on the ZnO nanosheet surface.

Figure 4 (a, b) show the TEM, HR-TEM, and mapping images
of Ag–ZnO
NSs.

To further understand the field
emission performance of the ZnO
and Ag–ZnO NSs, the measured current density electric field
(J–E) curves were analyzed
by the Fowler–Nordhein (F–N) equation24 1  E defines the applied field between cathode
and anode, J defines the current density, A is constant (A = 1.56 × 10–10 A V–2 eV), B is constant (B = 6.83 × 109 V eV–3/2 μm–1), ϕ defines the work function
of emitting material (the work function was ∼5.3 eV of ZnO23), and β defines the effective field enhancement
factor. The measurements of field electron emission were processed
in high vacuum for ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs in a homemade cavity.
The anode and cathode used indium-tin oxide glass (ITO glass) and
as-prepared samples (ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs). The working area
of the as-prepared sample is 25 mm2; the spacing between
anode and cathode is at about 160 μm. Figure 5a,b shows the J–E curves of field electron emission measurements from the
ZnO and Ag–ZnO samples. From the J–E curves, it can found that the turn-on fields were 5.3
and 3.2, and 4.3 and 2 V/μm of ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs in
the dark and under UV irradiation, respectively. The turn-on field
is defined as the electric field that corresponds to a current density
of 10–6 A/cm2. To further probe the effective
field enhancement factor, the Fowler–Nordheim equation was
more simplified22 2  The slope of F–N plot is a function
of both β and ϕ; it can be expressed as22 3  This function could be calculated by β
or ϕ.

Figure 5 (a, b) show the J–E curves
of field electron emission measurements and (c, d) show F–N
plot with (1/E) versus ln(J/E2) curves of field electron emission measurements
from ZnO and Ag-adsorbed ZnO samples.

Figure 5c,d
shows
F–N plot with (1/E) versus ln(J/E2) curves of field electron emission
measurements from ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs. From the F–N plot
of ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs, the field enhancement factors were estimated
to be about 3276 and 4815 and 3002 and 3420 under UV irradiation and
in the dark, respectively.

This phenomenon can be explained
by electric field theory and the
band diagram that is shown in Figure 6. The Fermi level of the depletion region of ZnO was
closer to the conductor band compared to valence band, because of
its typical n-type semiconductor property. In the case of an electric
field being applied to the ZnO, the conductor band was curved to the
Fermi level, resulting in electrons being gathered in a quantum well;
thereafter, electrons tunnel to the vacuum level. Here, there are
three factors that can enhance the characteristics of field emission:
(i) When the samples were irradiated to ultraviolet light, many electron–hole
pairs were generated and a large number of electrons moved to the
conduction band. (ii) When Ag nanoparticles are adsorbed on the surface
of ZnO nanosheets, a heterostructure was created between the interface
of ZnO and Ag nanoparticles, therefore increasing the quantum well.
(iii) The Ag nanoparticles can enhance the electrical conductivity.24,25 Both increase of field emission performances and reduction of the
turn-on field can happen in this situation. Figure 7 presents the reliability of Ag-adsorbed
ZnO NS samples when measured with an applied field of 3.2 V/μm
for 60 min. From Figure 7, it was found that Ag-adsorbed ZnO NS samples show good stability
during the measurement period.

III Conclusions
Our samples were successfully
synthesized on a glass substrate
via hydrothermal method. From the J–E curves, it can found that for the pure and Ag-adsorbed
ZnO samples, the turn-on fields were 5.3 and 3.2 and 4.3 and 2 V/μm
in the dark and under UV light, respectively. The Ag NPs adsorbed
on ZnO surface can enhance the electrical conductivity. In addition,
the Ag nanoparticles adsorbed can increase emitter points on ZnO NSs
surface. The results of this article demonstrate that decoration with
platinum on ZnO nanostructured surface can enhance field emission;
moreover, the illumination by UV light enhanced emission characteristics
from ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs.

IV Experimental
Section
First, an ultrasonic oscillator was used to wash
the glass substrates
(Corning 1737) with deionized water, acetone, and methanol. First,
the ZnO film was deposited as a seed layer for 25 nm by radio frequency
magnetron sputtering on a glass substrate. The size of the target
was 3 in. ZnO (99.99%) and the base pressure and radio frequency power
of the chamber were 3.75 × 10–8 Pa and 100
W, respectively. During sputtering, the pressure gases were kept at
5 mTorr and the Ar and O2 gas flows into the chamber were
kept 18 and 2 sccm, respectively. The aqueous solution was sodium
hydroxide (0.4 M) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.1 M) dissolved in
deionized water. Subsequently, the sample of the seed layer coated
on the substrate was steeped in solution for 1 h at room temperature.
The reaction was completed, and the sample was rinsed in deionized
water and subsequently dried at room temperature. The rapid thermal
annealing system was used to anneal the sample in oxygen environment
for 5 min at 400 °C. Thereafter, the sample of the NSs/seed layer/glass
was steeped in solution for 15 min at room temperature; the solution
is 0.1 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3, Sigma-Aldrich) under UV
light (254 nm, 0.025 W/cm2).26,27 The field
emission element based on Ag-decorated ZnO NSs was finished.

The field electron emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM,
Hitachi S-4800I) was used to measure and check the surface morphology
of the ZnO NSs and Ag–ZnO NSs. The high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (HR-TEM, Philips Tecnai F20 G2 FEG-TEM) and Bruker
D8 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to measure and check the crystalline
structure of the ZnO and Ag–ZnO NSs. The field emission characteristics
of our samples were measured by Keithley 2410 equipment in a homemade
cavity (the pressure condition was maintained below 37.5 × 10–9 Pa in the vacuum cavity). The anode and cathode used
ITO glass with 30 mm width and 5 mm length and out samples. The distance
between the cathode and anode is 160 μm. The electron beam evaporator
is used to deposit Pt contact electrode (about 100 nm thick) in our
samples. The field emission characteristics were measured using Keithley
2410 system for providing voltages (the voltages were provided from
0 to 1100 V, with each stage increasing by 10 V).
