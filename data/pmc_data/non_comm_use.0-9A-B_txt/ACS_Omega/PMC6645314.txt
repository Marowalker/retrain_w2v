In
this study, we demonstrate that bipolar electrochemistry is
a viable strategy for “wireless” electrochemical intercalation
of graphite flakes and further large-scale production of high-quality
graphene suspensions. Expansion of the graphite layers leads to a
dramatic 20-fold increase in the yield of high-shear exfoliation.
Large graphite flakes, which do not produce graphene upon high shear
if left untreated, are exfoliated in a yield of 16.0 ± 0.2%.
Successful graphene production was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy
and scanning transmission electron microscopy, showing that the graphene
flakes are 0.4–1.5 μm in size with the majority of flakes
consisting of 4–6 graphene layers. Moreover, a low intensity
of the D peak relative to the G peak as expressed by the ID/IG ratio in Raman spectroscopy
along with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images
reveals that the graphene sheets are essentially undamaged by the
electrochemical intercalation. Some impurities reside on the graphene
after the electrochemical treatment, presumably because of oxidative
polymerization of the solvent, as suggested by electron energy loss
spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In general, the
bipolar electrochemical exfoliation method provides a pathway for
intercalation on a wider range of graphite substrates and enhances
the efficiency of the exfoliation. This method could potentially be
combined with simultaneous electrochemical functionalization to provide
graphene specifically designed for a given composite on a larger scale.

Introduction
Following the first
micromechanical cleavage of graphene from graphite,1 applications of this two-dimensional (2D) material
have been proposed within diverse areas such as polymer composites,2,3 energy storage,4 and nanoelectronics.5,6 All these applications aim to utilize the exceptional mechanical7 and electronic1,8 properties
of graphene. Development of economic and high-yield bulk graphene
production methods have become crucial to enable the further progress
toward these applications.9

Currently,
several strategies exist for large-scale top-down production
of graphene from graphite, including chemical exfoliation,10 electrochemical exfoliation,11−14 and liquid-phase exfoliation
using ultrasound15 or high shear.16 The high-shear exfoliation method developed
by Paton et al. produces oxygen-free graphene of good quality.16 Unfortunately, the yield is low (<1%), and
the procedure would become slightly cumbersome in a scaled-up version,
where the requirement of graphite removal and recycling between exfoliation
steps would be necessary to produce the material more efficiently.
Recently, electrochemical exfoliation has attracted substantial interest
as a method for the production of high-quality graphene in bulk quantities.
Exfoliation was demonstrated in both aqueous5,6,12 and nonaqueous11,14 solvents under either anodic or cathodic conditions. Both positive
and negative ions of varying sizes have already been used for graphite
intercalation,13,17,18 making it possible to fine-tune the properties of the intercalated
product. A limitation of electrochemical exfoliation pertains to the
need for electrical contact with graphite to drive the intercalation
process.5,6,14 Attempts to
remedy this include placing the working electrode at the bottom of
the electrochemical cell11 or using liquid
NaK alloys as an electron source.19 A versatile
and easily scaled-up bulk electrochemical method using graphite flakes
or powder as the source material would be highly desirable.

In this respect, the “wireless” bipolar electrochemistry
becomes particularly interesting.20,21 By polarizing
an electrolyte containing a conducting substrate (the bipolar electrode,
BE) in an electric field between two feeder electrodes (FEs), simultaneous
electrochemical oxidation and reduction can be driven at the extremities
of the BE (Figure 1a).22 Previous examples of this technique
include modification of metal substrates,23,24 functionalization of carbon substrates such as glassy carbon,24,25 carbon nanotubes,26−28 graphite,29 and graphene,30,31 and exfoliation of 2D materials such as WS232,33 and black phosphorus.34

In this paper, we propose a new method for the bulk production
of pristine graphene flakes, in which high-shear exfoliation is combined
with bipolar electrochemistry. We demonstrate that with bipolar electrochemistry
an efficient graphite intercalation process can be accomplished to
significantly increase the exfoliation efficiency upon high-shear
exfoliation (yield = 16.0%). Our method bypasses the need for an electrical
contact to the graphite source material and may thus be applied to
graphite powder or flakes in a simple setup. This demonstrates a true
bulk process for high-yield production of graphene, in a manner that
should be suitable to scale-up. Future work on this method should
allow for scalable production of functionalized graphene sheets by
combining the production with a direct functionalization step using
diazonium salts30 or a simultaneous functionalization
and exfoliation.35,36

Results and Discussion
First, to demonstrate that bipolar electrochemistry is a viable
method for electrochemical graphite intercalation, the setup shown
in Figure 1a was used
to intercalate tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) into a 1 cm piece of graphite foil (Figure 1b) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP). Other salts could also have been used for graphite intercalation.13,17,18Figure 1c shows a significant expansion of the cathodic
end (left side) of the graphite foil. The expansion is expected to
occur from the intercalation of Bu4N+ at the
cathodic end (left side) of the electrode with the oxidation of NMP
taking place at the anodic end.

Figure 1d shows
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the edge of the pristine
graphite foil, whereas Figure 1e,f illustrates the expansion of the layers as a result of
the intercalation of Bu4N+ at the cathodic end
of the foil.18 A clear separation of the
graphite layers is observed. The graphite was also analyzed using
Raman spectroscopy (Figure 1g). The intercalated edge exhibits an additional G peak at
1596 cm–1, which is commonly observed for intercalated
graphite, because of the different environment of the graphite layers
situated next to intercalated ions rather than neighboring graphite
layers.37,38 The D peak is very small in the pristine
graphite and does not change with intercalation, showing that this
process does not damage the graphene sheets. Furthermore, this rules
out the possibility that the shoulder on the G peak in the intercalated
graphite could be a defect-related D′ peak.39,40

The theoretical potential difference between the anodic and
cathodic
ends of the BE can be calculated from eq 1. 1  

In this expression,
ΔE is the voltage between
the FEs, L is the distance between the FEs, ΔV is the potential difference across the BE, and l is the length of the BE.30,41 A ΔV of 14.3 V can be achieved in our experimental setup, considering
ΔE = 50 V, L = 3.5 cm, and l = 1 cm. As observed in Figure 1, this voltage was sufficient to drive a
cathodic intercalation and an anodic oxidation of NMP for the graphite
foil BE.

For the purpose of graphene production from flakes
or powders,
it is reasonable to assume that a similar ΔV can be utilized for exfoliation; however, adjustments will be necessary
due to the decrease in the BE size. A minimum ΔE of 950 V can be expected for flakes of ∼150 μm in size,
if the FEs are positioned closer together with a distance L = 1 cm. Previous studies have shown that bipolar electrochemistry
using high voltages is possible if the temperature and conductivity
of the electrolyte are carefully controlled.25,28L values smaller than 1 cm were tested but led
to repeated short circuit of the FEs.

A two-step procedure was
used for graphene production: (1) intercalation
of Bu4N+ via bipolar electrochemistry (Scheme 1a) and (2) high-shear
exfoliation of intercalated graphite to produce graphene (Scheme 1b). These two steps
can be performed consecutively and require no midway workup. Briefly,
1 mM Bu4NBF4 in NMP was mixed with graphite
flakes (1 mg mL–1). Two stainless steel FEs set
1 cm apart were immersed in the solution (Scheme 1a). A voltage of 1100 V was applied between
the FEs for 1 h, while vigorously stirring the solution. The graphene
was then exfoliated for 1 h at a shear rate of 33 000 s–1 (Scheme 1b). Finally, the solution was centrifuged to remove large
flakes of residual graphite, and the supernatant was collected.

by filtration of a known volume on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)
membrane filters, and the results are reported in Table 1.

An application of extreme electrochemical
conditions for graphene production
has the potential to generate organic residues from side reactions
at the FEs, which would add to the overall yield. To assess this and
evaluate the quality of the graphene produced, a number of characterization
techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron
energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) were employed. Figure 3 shows the TGA of the graphene
sample from 30 to 1100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Foremost, it reveals a mass loss at 600 °C,
which potentially could originate from the decomposition of organic
NMP residues on graphene.42 This is supported
by performing XPS analysis of the samples before and after TGA, which
shows an increase in the C/N ratio from 66 to 393, respectively. The
total mass retained after the loss at 600 °C is 75.9%. A detailed
analysis of the atomic ratios (see the Supporting Information) concludes that 84.5% of the collected mass is
from graphene, which matches the results from TGA. From this, we estimate
a corrected graphene yield of 16.0 ± 0.2%, as reported in Table 1.

Figure 3 TGA of the graphene produced
by the combined bipolar intercalation
and high-shear exfoliation showing the (a) mass loss as the temperature
is increased and (b) first derivative of the mass loss with respect
to temperature.

Obtaining a yield of
16.0% is a remarkable improvement compared
with our control experiments and other studies on bulk production
of graphene. Previous studies have shown yields of <0.1% for high-shear
exfoliation16 and ∼1% for ultrasonication
of graphite,15 with possibilities of recycling
the remaining graphite to obtain a higher yield. The combined bipolar
electrochemical intercalation and high-shear exfoliation thus provides
a significant improvement without even considering recycling residual
graphite.

Figure 4 illustrates
a representative Raman spectrum, recorded from the exfoliated graphene
by the combined bipolar intercalation and high-shear exfoliation deposited
on SiO2. Raman spectroscopy is a strong tool in the quality
assessment of graphene because a qualitative description of the defect
density and the number of layers is easily derived. The spectrum displays
the three characteristic peaks that would be expected from graphene
flakes, that is, the D, G, and 2D peaks as well as the minor D + D′,
2D′, and D + D″ peaks.40 These
peaks are all commonly fitted to Lorentzian functions. However, to
make a good fit, it was necessary to add an additional Gaussian peak
at the base of the G peak. We hypothesize that this could be from
amorphous carbon (am-C) in the form of an NMP residue from the electrochemical
procedure.43

Figure 4 Representative Raman
spectrum of the produced graphene by the combined
bipolar intercalation and high-shear exfoliation.

hrough examination of the intensity, I,
from the
Raman spectrum, we find ID/IG = 0.24 ± 0.10 and I2D/IG = 0.53 ± 0.08, and for full
width at half maximum (Γ) of the 2D peak, Γ2D = 69.8 ± 5.4 cm–1. On the basis of the 2D
peak shape,16 we deduce that the majority
of flakes contain 4–6 graphene layers (see the Supporting Information). These results are similar
to the work of Paton et al.16 wherein they
showed that the D peak in this type of graphene was related to the
flake size and mainly caused by edge defects. Graphene with comparable
or slightly lower ID/IG values than the graphene produced in this paper was
demonstrated in recent works of Cooper et al.,14 Yang et al.,12 and Ossonon and
Bélanger.35 The lower ratios in
these works is most likely due to a larger average flake size. Importantly,
in those cases, a direct electrochemical intercalation procedure was
employed in contrast to the more versatile wireless procedure used
in this work.

Figure 5 shows the
size distribution of graphene flakes (maximum length) measured from
STEM images containing 412 flakes (see the Supporting Information). As seen, it approximately follows a log–normal
distribution, as has previously been described for fragmentation processes
in 2D materials.44 The mean flake size
is 0.42 μm, which is smaller than the graphene flakes of 1–5
μm described by Yang et al.12 and
Ossonon and Bélanger.35 The graphene
flakes produced in this work are probably smaller because of the high
shear forces employed, cutting the sheets apart as they are exfoliated.

bipolar intercalation and high-shear exfoliation with a fitted log–normal
distribution (blue curve) and mean size [red error bar, 0.42 μm,
95% confidence interval = (0.38, 0.46) μm]45 based on 412 flakes.

The electrical properties of graphene films deposited on
a nylon
membrane were examined. The films are found to be electrically conducting,
as would be expected from the low ID/IG in Raman spectroscopy. However, a large internal
resistance is measured which we ascribe to poor electrical contact
between individual flakes (see the Supporting Information for details). In an attempt to resolve this matter,
we are performing ongoing work using bipolar electrochemistry to connect
individual graphene flakes with silver nanowires.

Figure 6 shows further
structural examination of the graphene flakes using monochromated
HR-TEM. A low-magnification image was acquired on a 1.5 μm flake
with an overall appearance of a thin sheet with many surface impurities,
which were later examined with EELS. Upon observation of exfoliated
flakes at a higher magnification, Figure 6b reveals that the impurities consist of
amorphous residues, but more importantly, clean graphene areas are
easily identifiable. Furthermore, Figure 6c illustrates the rough structure of the
graphene edge, potentially originating from damage from the production
method, chemical functionalities located along the graphene edge,
and/or electron-induced beam damage. The insets in Figure 6 show the Fourier transforms
acquired from different areas containing the graphene sheets.46,47

graphene flakes and (b,c) HR-TEM images of different areas in the

Figure 7 displays
a STEM-EELS analysis (using HyperSpy 1.1)48 based on a spectrum image of the graphene flake segment shown in Figure 7b, which is used
to describe the chemical impurities present on the surface of the
graphene sheets in greater detail. Ordinary elemental maps and extracted
spectra from EELS are available in the Supporting Information. To eliminate noise in the data set, we performed
principal component analysis (PCA), in which the first seven PCs were
used based on the scree plot (see the Supporting Information). These seven components explain 97.8% of the variance
in the data set. Simply utilizing the raw EELS spectra to map the
location of the impurities in this data set is particularly difficult
owing to the overlap of the C species originating from the crystalline
C in the graphene flakes and the am-C residuals from the solvent.
Furthermore, other edge overlaps were observed between C and Ca, O
and Cr, and F and Fe. However, by performing independent component
analysis (ICA) in HyperSpy,48 it was possible
to separate the different impurity sources. We found that using five
independent components (ICs) resulted in clearly separated component
spectra that were also physically reasonable.

Figure 7 ICA of an EELS map from
a graphene flake with the (a) independent
component spectra IC1–5, (b) ADF image of a graphene flake,
where the green rectangle highlights the area analyzed with EELS,
and (c–g) spatial loading maps of IC1–5. All scale bars
are 40 nm.

Figure 7a displays
each component along with the energies of the edges for each element
found in the sample. Figure 7c–g shows the corresponding loading maps for each IC.
It should be noted that while principle components (PCs) are ranked
by significance, ICs are randomly ordered, and thus, IC1 is not more
significant in describing the sample than the other ICs.49 The graphene signal is captured in IC5 where
the C-K edge displays sharp π* and σ* peaks.50 The corresponding loading map (Figure 7g) displays the presence of
graphene covering the entire map, as the sheet is intact with the
possible overlap of two different layers, displayed by the sharp boundary
in the lower right part of the image.

An am-C signal on graphene
is evident in IC2 and IC3,50 which is observed
as clusters on the sample.
IC3 clearly displays an O-K edge and a small N-K edge. Because the
source of am-C is most likely originating from oxidized NMP during
the bipolar electrochemistry, the simultaneous presence of C, O, and
N is to be expected in IC3. A small amount of Fe is also found in
IC3, which may be due to the spectral overlap with IC1. Both am-C
and O signals are found in IC2. A literature investigation was completed
for the potential compounds within our material to try to identify
the spectral fingerprint of each molecule (NMP and Bu4N+), but the noise and uncertainty in the decomposition do not
allow for an unambiguous assignment of the molecules.51−53

Upon further examination of the ICs, a Ca impurity, along
with
a small amount of F, is captured in IC4, which is probably a remnant
of the CaCl2 used in the workup procedure. If a small quantity
of CaF2 was present in the CaCl2, this could
be the potential source of F on the graphene sheets as CaF2 is insoluble in water. Finally, IC1 shows the presence primarily
of iron and chromium particles and trace amounts of C and O, indicating
that the stainless steel FEs are, as expected, not entirely stable
at the 1100 V applied during the bipolar electrochemistry.

In Table 2, the
quantification of elements in the graphene sample using XPS is reported.
In general, they agree with the EELS analysis, although the finding
of 1.5 at % nitrogen is noteworthy. The nitrogen content was not clearly
revealed by all EELS spectra; however, other EELS studies on organic
materials similar to NMP have also been unsuccessful in detecting
nitrogen.54 The fact that the analysis
spot area in XPS is significantly larger makes the detection of low-concentration
elements easier using this technique. The potential nitrogen sources
are organic polymeric residues formed from the oxidation of NMP and/or
remains of Bu4N+ ions intercalated between the
layers. As already mentioned, the am-C detected with EELS and the
24% material loss observed in TGA until 600° would be consistent
with the presence of such residues. The clear increase in the C/N
ratio after TGA supports this statement.

at 286.0 eV, and O=C–N at 288.0
eV. Overall, this corresponds well to graphene with impurities consisting
mainly of NMP residues.16,55

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed an electrochemical
pretreatment
for the exfoliation of graphene from graphite that increases the yield
of high-shear production of graphene substantially to as much as 16.0
± 0.2%. This method exploits the wireless capabilities of bipolar
electrochemistry as a pretreatment of the graphite to intercalate
and expand the graphite structure. The graphene produced by this method
is structurally intact. Chemical impurities are present to some extent
and, depending on the application, additional cleaning of graphene
might be necessary. Future experiments with different solvents, intercalants,
and using membranes to separate FEs and BEs could provide optimized
systems that help remedy the impurities. The wireless nature of the
method makes it versatile, and thus, it can be applied to other graphite
sources or other conducting materials in a scalable manner.

Experimental
Section
Graphite Intercalation Using Bipolar Electrochemistry
A 1 cm piece of graphite foil was placed between two stainless steel
FEs (6 cm × 1.5 cm) 3.5 cm apart in a solution of 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in NMP. A voltage of 50 V was applied between
the FEs for 2 min. The sample was rinsed with NMP and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) acetone before analysis.

Graphene Production
with Bipolar Electrochemistry and High-Shear
Exfoliation
Bu4NBF4 (100 mL, 1 mM)
was mixed with 100 mg of graphite flakes in a large beaker. The solution
was placed in an ethylene glycol/dry ice cooling bath and allowed
to cool to −10 °C. A magnetic stir bar was added, and
two freshly polished stainless steel electrodes (6 cm × 1.5 cm)
were mounted 1 cm apart. The electrodes reaching ∼1 cm into
the solution were connected to the power supply. Using a Heinzinger
PNC 6000-300 power supply, 1100 V was applied for 1 h under vigorous
stirring, while monitoring the temperature. The voltage was turned
off if the temperature raised above 50 °C, and the system was
then allowed to cool to −10 °C before again applying the
voltage. The voltage, current, and solution temperature were monitored
while applying a voltage (see Figure S2). After 1 h of applied voltage, the solution turned black. Following
bipolar electrochemical intercalation, the cooling bath, the stirrer
bar, and the electrodes were removed. Graphene was exfoliated by applying
a shear rate of 33 000 s–1 (6000 rpm) for
1 h using a Pro Scientific PRO250 rotor–stator mixer with a
20 mm shear generator. The solution was centrifuged at 750g for 20 min to remove residual graphite and collect the
supernatant. The yield of graphene was measured by filtering 10 mL
of suspension on 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filters (Sterlitech),
washing with 30 mL of ethanol, and drying at 80 °C overnight.
The filters were all weighed with 0.01 mg precision five times before
and after deposition, and the yields were calculated relative to the
graphite starting concentration of ∼1.00 mg mL–1 (exact masses recorded for each experiment was used in calculations).
The majority of graphene in the solution was collected by mixing the
NMP suspension 1:1 with a 1 wt % CaCl2 aqueous solution
to induce precipitation overnight. The following day, the solution
was centrifuged, and the sediment was filtrated, washed with deionized
water, and oven-dried.

Raman Spectroscopy
For Raman analysis,
graphene powder
from a PTFE filter was suspended in ethanol by ultrasonication for
30 min. Graphene was then self-assembled into thin films, by the method
developed by Shim et al.,56 and collected
onto wafers of 285 nm SiO2 on Si. The samples were dried
at 80 °C overnight before analysis. A Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope
equipped with a 150 mW 514 nm laser was operated at an intensity of
∼5 mW and using a 150× lens. For each experiment, 441
spectra were acquired using a 5 s acquisition time in the Streamline
HR mode. Wire 4.3 was used for the analysis. A polynomial background
was subtracted before fitting to Lorentzian functions and a Gaussian
function.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS analysis was performed
on graphene deposited on SiO2, as in Raman spectroscopy.
A Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD spectrometer was used. A monochromatic Al
Kα X-ray source at a power of 150 W with an analysis area of
300 × 700 μm2 was used as the X-ray source.
To record survey spectra, two acquisitions were performed in the 0–1350
eV range at a pass energy of 160 eV. Four acquisitions at a pass energy
of 20 eV were used for high-resolution scans. CasaXPS was used for
data processing. Atomic surface concentrations were determined by
subtracting a Shirley background, using the default sensitivity factors.
All spectra were calibrated against the C=C sp2 peak
for C 1s at 284.5 eV.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The amount
of amorphous
carbon in the sample was determined from TGA on a Netzsch STA 449
instrument. The sample was heated from 30 to 1000 °C at a rate
of 10 °C min–1 in an argon atmosphere. A smoothing
spline was used on the mass–temperature curve before calculating
the first derivative.

High-Resolution TEM, STEM, and STEM-EELS
The graphene
powder was suspended in HPLC methanol by ultrasonication, and two
drops were deposited on a 200-mesh copper grid with a lacey carbon
support structure. Prior to analysis, the samples were baked at 100
°C in vacuum (<10–5 mbar) overnight. HR-TEM
and annular dark-field (ADF) imaging were performed on a FEI Titan
80-300 Cubed TEM equipped with a monochromator, a hexapole-based aberration
corrector (corrected electron optical systems GmbH) for the image
and probe lenses, and a high brightness field-emission gun (XFEG).
An 80 kV electron source was used to limit knock-on damage to the
graphene. The monochromator was used to achieve an energy resolution
of 0.26 eV based on the full width at half maximum of the zero-loss
peak for negative Cs monochromated HR-TEM imaging. EELS spectra were
acquired in STEM mode using Gatan DigitalMicrograph software. The
spectrum image was treated in Gatan DigitalMicrograph to align and
calibrate the spectra to a C-K π* energy of 285.0 eV, and X-rays
were removed using automated procedures. PCA and ICA were performed
in HyperSpy 1.1 (hyperspy.org).48 The STEM images for measuring graphene
flake sizes were obtained on a FEI Talos F200X analytical STEM with
an XFEG at 200 kV.
