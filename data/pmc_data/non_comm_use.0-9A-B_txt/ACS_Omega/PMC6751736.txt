A novel formic acid-assisted rapid
and efficient route for C–S bond construction via the thiol–ene
reaction has been reported. Exclusively, the anti-Markovnikov product
was obtained in good to excellent yield using the developed protocol.
Various styrenes and thiols bearing different functionalities were
well tolerated. The reaction also provided a good yield of sulfones
in a one-pot two-step protocol. The developed method is operationally
simple, green, metal-free, solvent-free, and having a high atom economy
with high regioselectivity.

1 Introduction
Organosulfur
compounds serve as synthons for the various chemical transformations
in organic synthesis. Organosulfur compounds are found in several
biologically active natural products, bioactive peptides, food products,
and flavoring agents.1,2 These compounds are also an important
intermediate in pharmaceuticals, as well as in material chemistry.3 The thiol–ene click reaction produces
the thioether following the free-radical as well as ionic mechanism.4−7 The reaction provided two types of products following Markovnikov
and anti-Markovnikov additions.8 Previously,
various metal-catalyzed (Ru, Cu, In) methods have been developed to
construct the C–S bond.9−12 However, the use of an expensive and toxic metal
catalyst and hazardous reaction conditions limit the scope of these
methodologies. Few metal-free approaches were also reported using
ionic liquids, silica nanoparticles, and Amberlyst as catalyst.13−16 Cumbersome catalyst synthesis, tedious recyclability, and limited
substrate scope are the drawbacks of the previously reported protocols.
To overcome these challenges, we report a green, base-free, metal-free
formic acid-mediated protocol for the synthesis of thioethers at room
temperature (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Thiol–Ene Reaction
2 Results and Discussion
To begin our investigation,
styrene and 4-methoxy thiophenol were chosen as model substrates.
Initially, the reaction was tested in various solvents in the presence
of potassium tert-butoxide as a base at room temperature,
but no reaction was observed (Table 1, entries 1–5). Further, the reaction was attempted
with different bases unsuccessfully (entries 6–8). A reaction
in formic acid with potassium tert-butoxide provided
the desired thioether (entry 9) in moderate yield. However, when the
reaction was performed in acetic acid, a slight decrease in the yield
was observed (entry 10). The presence of base resulted in the formation
of disulfide, which decreases selectivity for the desired product.
Next, when a reaction was performed in the absence of base, an optimal
yield of the desired product was obtained (entry 11). Similarly, the
reaction in acetic acid has also proceeded well in the absence of
base with slightly lower yield (entry 12). The reaction performed
in BF3·O(C2H5)2 and
Cu(OTf)2 resulted in no reaction (entries 13 and 14). However,
a reaction without formic acid showed a considerable decrease in yield
due to the formation of disulfides. Formic acid was found to be efficient
for the rapid conversion of styrene and thiol into their anti-Markovnikov
products at room temperature.

With optimized reaction conditions
in hand, the substrate scope for various styrene and thiol derivatives
was tested. Initially, styrene was reacted with 4-methoxy thiophenol
and provided 92% yield of the desired product (Scheme 2, 3a). The styrenes bearing
electron-donating groups were well tolerated and delivered the product
in good to excellent yield (Scheme 2, 3b−d). The sterically hindered
substrate such as 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene also gave the product in
good yield (Scheme 2, 3d). The halogen-substituted styrene also reacted
well and resulted in good to excellent yield of the desired product
(Scheme 2, 3e−g). Styrenes bearing electron-withdrawing groups such as nitrile,
nitro, and carboxylic acid were tolerated well and provided good yields
(Scheme 2, 3h−j). The O-acetyl group-containing styrene also tolerated
well and provided a good yield (Scheme 2, 3ak). Cyclic styrene systems such as
indene and 1,2-dihydronaphthalene also reacted well and provided a
good yield of the required product (Scheme 2, 3l, 3m). The
heterocyclic styrenes transformed into the desired thioether in good
yields (Scheme 2, 3n, 3o). Naphthalene and biphenyl derivatives
were also reacted well and provided an excellent yield of the desired
product (Scheme 2, 3p, 3q). The bulkier hydrocarbon like 9-vinyl
anthracene gave a good yield of the product (Scheme 2, 3r). The reaction was not
observed with allylic and aliphatic alkenes (Scheme 2, 3s, 3t).

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope for Various Styrenes,
Reaction conditions: 1 (1.0

Various Thiols,

conditions: 4 (1.0 equiv), 5 (1.0 equiv),

Isolated yield, NR: no reaction.

Next, reactions were performed with different thiols.
Thiophenol gave an excellent yield of thioether with styrene (Scheme 3, 6a). Various thiols bearing electron-donating groups reacted well and
provided good to excellent yield of the desired thioether (Scheme 3, 6b−d). The thiol-containing electron-withdrawing group furnishes the
corresponding product in good to excellent yield (Scheme 3, 6e−g).
However, aliphatic thiol did not yield the desired product (Scheme 3, 6h).

The established protocol was further investigated for the
thiol alkyne reaction, which provided the E/Z mixture of the desired product. The synthesized products
and methodology developed are important for several chemical transformations
and material chemistry.17−19 When the reaction of phenylacetylene
(1 equiv), 4-methoxy thiophenol (1 equiv), and formic acid (10 equiv)
was subjected to the optimized reaction conditions, an excellent yield
of the product was obtained. The resulting product was found to be
an E/Z mixture in 20:80 ratio (Scheme 4, 8).
To demonstrate the feasibility and sustainability of the developed
protocol, we performed the gram-scale synthesis on substrate 9 and a good yield of the desired product was obtained (Scheme 4, 11). The sulfone derivative of the desired thioether was synthesized
in good yield (Scheme 4, 12).

Reaction conditions: 7 (1 equiv), 2 (1 equiv), formic acid (10 equiv), rt,

Isolated yield.

E/Z ratio was calculated using 1H NMR, 9 (1 equiv), 10 (1 equiv), rt, 60
min.

Isolated yield in the
gram-scale reaction: 1 (1 equiv), 2 (1 equiv),
formic acid (10 equiv), H2O2 (5 equiv) rt, 1.5
h.

To understand the mechanism of the developed protocol,
following control experiments were performed. Initially, the reaction
with disulfide furnished no product, which ruled out the formation
of disulfide intermediate during the reaction (Scheme 5, A). The reaction of styrene
and 4-methoxy thiophenol provided a good yield of the required product
in the presence of a radical quencher (TEMPO), which ruled out a free-radical
pathway (Scheme 5, B). Next, the isotopic experiment was done to gain the mechanistic
insight into the reaction. The reaction with deuterated formic acid
provided a collective yield of 86% for the desired product having
the D/H ratio of 6:4 (Scheme 5, C). This result indicates that the hydrogen
atom of formic acid plays an important role in the reaction by transferring
the hydrogen atom as well as by thiol activation via electrostatic
attraction (hydrogen bonding). To identify the participation of hydrogen
atom during the reaction, we performed the reaction in deuterated
acetic acid and found a similar result, which confirmed that the hydrogen
atom of the carboxylic group is responsible for the initiation and
rapid conversion of the reaction. The reaction of styrene with sodium
thiophenolate also gave the desired product in good yield, which confirmed
the role of formic acid in the reaction (Scheme 5, D and Scheme 6).

Scheme 5 Control Experiment,
Isolated yield

D/H ratio was calculated using 1H NMR.

Scheme 6 Plausible Mechanism
To support it further, we carried out the infrared analysis of
the reaction. Formic acid showed a strong band at 1726 cm–1, which corresponds to the carbonyl group (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).20,21 The IR spectra of 4-methoxy thiophenol gave a signal at 2559 cm–1, corresponding to the S–H group (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).7 When formic acid and 4-methoxy thiophenol were
mixed, a shift was observed in both formic acid (1726 to 1730 cm–1) and 4-methoxy thiophenol (2559 to 2567 cm–1) bands in IR spectra, which shows the interaction between thiol
and formic acid (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have developed a green, metal-free, and solvent-free methodology
for the synthesis of thioethers. The developed protocol has wide functional
group tolerance and found to be operational for gram-scale synthesis.
Besides, the mechanistic study was performed to ascertain the mechanism
of this important protocol.
