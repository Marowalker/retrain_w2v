The RNA aptamer A4 binds specifically
to tumor prostate cells.
A4 was modified (mA4) by adding deoxyribonucleotides to its ends to
remove the reactive 2′ hydroxyl groups of RNA’s sugar
at the ends of the aptamer and to make it more stable to widespread
RNase contamination in laboratories. Thus, mA4 would be more suitable
to use in the clinical settings of prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed
to characterize this optimized oligonucleotide to verify its potential
as a diagnostic tool. The sequences and structures of A4 and mA4 were
compared through in silico approaches to corroborate their similarity.
Then, the degradation of mA4 was measured in appropriate media and
human plasma for in vitro tests. In addition, the binding abilities
of A4 to prostate cells were contrasted with those of mA4. The effects
of mA4 were assessed on the viability, proliferation, and migration
of human prostate cell lines RWPE-1 and PC-3 in three-dimensional
(3D) cell cultures. mA4 showed configurational motifs similar to those
of A4, displayed a half-life in plasma substantially higher than A4,
and exhibited a comparable binding capacity to that of A4 and unaltered
viability, proliferation, and migration of prostatic cells. Therefore,
mA4 maintains the crucial 3D structures of A4 that would allow binding
to its target, as suggested by in silico and binding analyses. mA4
may be a good PCa reporter as it does not change cellular parameters
of prostate cells when incubated with it. Its additional deoxyribonucleotides
make mA4 inherently more chemically stable than A4, avoiding its degradation
and favoring its storage and handling for clinical applications. These
characteristics support the potential of mA4 to be used in diagnostic
systems for PCa.

==== Body
1 Introduction
According
to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
Program from the National Cancer Institute in the United States, patients
with metastatic stage of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis showed a
five-year relative survival of only 30.5%, while patients with localized
or regional lymph node stage at diagnosis had a five-year relative
survival of 100% between 2009 and 2015.1 Consequently, the substantial gap between these two populations
of patients suggests that the stage of PCa at diagnosis is crucial
for patient survival rates and earlier diagnoses and treatments could
improve them.2

PCa is screened by
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test,
sometimes complemented by digital rectal examination. After a positive
result, PCa is confirmed by histopathological examination of a biopsy.3 In the cases of negative ultrasound-guided biopsy
in men with a high probability of sampling error, most urologists
use prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
PCa diagnosis.4 However, conflicting recommendations
for the use of PSA in the clinical management of PCa5,6 evidenced that PSA is an unspecific biomarker with questionable
utility in some cases.

On the one hand, high levels of PSA may
not indicate PCa. In fact,
PSA is produced by other glands, under other conditions and found
even in females.7 Thus, there is a high
chance of false-positive results with up to 67% of overdiagnosed and
overtreated patients.8 On the other hand,
about a quarter of men with low PSA levels have PCa and are underdiagnosed.9 In addition, PSA testing does not avoid the biopsy
procedure for diagnosis, which is also susceptible of false-negatives
because of sampling errors.10 These facts
support the re-assessment of PSA and the search for more accurate
and definitive biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of PCa.

The approaches that analyze tumor components released in body fluids
are called liquid biopsies.11 These liquid
biopsies represent the current state of a cancer in an individual
and their sampling is less invasive than surgical biopsies.12 Among other constituents, tumors release cells
that may be detected in blood. These cells are known as circulating
tumor cells (CTCs). The expression of surface markers on CTCs and
their quantification have already been studied as factors for the
clinical management of several cancers.13 For PCa, CTCs in blood samples are the most researched target in
liquid biopsies.14

In this view,
our research group used the prostate cell lines PC-3
and RWPE-1 as positive and negative targets, respectively, to select
ligands of PCa CTCs by the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment in three-dimensional cell cultures (3D Cell-SELEX).15 This technology yielded several RNA aptamers
that bind specifically to PC-3 cells. The A4 aptamer was one of the
selected aptamers which showed a small size and a low free energy
according to the minimum free energy (MFE) structure by the Sfold
web server.16 Owing to these desirable
characteristics in aptamers, A4 was further characterized, showing
a high affinity for PC-3 cells.15 Therefore,
we theorized that A4 may be used as a diagnostic tool which detects
PCa CTCs in blood samples from patients.

However, factors and
enzymes that degrade RNAs are highly efficient,
as they show complementary and frequently reiterative mechanisms.
In fact, RNAs may pose a great threat to the humans. For example,
noncoding RNAs may interfere in the regulation of gene expression
and viral RNAs may replicate to infect host cells.17 RNA aptamers are chemically more unstable than DNA aptamers
because of their 2′ hydroxyl group that makes them more susceptible
to hydrolysis and ribonuclease action.18,19

However,
wobble base pairs in RNA aptamers, such as guanosine–uridine
bonds, allow for more complex 3D structures, when compared to DNA
structures.20 For these reasons, we maintained
the unique sequence of the original RNA aptamer with its more intricate
design and we added DNA ends with their higher chemical stability
to a new version of A4 called mA4. The rest of the original RNA aptamer
corresponds to sequences complementary to the primers used in the
selection process that are identical in the other aptamers. At the
5′ end, we changed the sugar of nucleotides 1 to 14 to deoxyribose
to improve RNase resistance and added a thymine spacer of 13 nucleotides.
This spacer is important to avoid potential steric hindrance because
of the interaction of the coupled biotin with labeled avidin molecules
and allow target recognition.21 At the
3′ end, we changed the sugar of nucleotides 44 to 46 to deoxyribose
and replaced the uracil base 46 with thymine, a canonical base in
DNA, again to improve RNase resistance.

Thus, we combined the
advantages of the two types of nucleotides
in mA4, with the intention of reducing its susceptibility to degradation
without perturbing its putative binding motifs. In the present work,
we use in silico approaches to verify the similar composition and
structure of A4 and mA4 and in vitro approaches to compare their resistance
to nuclease in plasma and cell culture media. Enzyme-linked apta-sorbent
assay (ELASA) is also used to prove whether mA4 maintains the binding
profile of A4.

In addition to being specific and resistant to
nuclease, nucleotide-based
probes should not be prone to induce undesirable biological changes
in order to be implemented in theranostic applications. Accordingly,
we also characterize the biological effects of mA4 on the viability,
proliferation, and migration of human prostate cell lines used to
select it. The PC-3 cell line was isolated from bone marrow and it
displays an androgen-independent growth, being considered a good model
of advanced prostate adenocarcinoma22 and
later of prostatic small cell carcinoma.23 Differently, RWPE-1 cell line was developed from the immortalization
of nontumorigenic prostatic epithelial cells with human papilloma
virus 18 representing a benign prostatic epithelium, which is androgen-sensitive.24

With these human cell lines, we can delimit
the potential clinical
uses of mA4 in the management of PCa patients. Thus, we hypothesize
that mA4, the optimized version of A4, can also be used as a diagnostic
tool for PCa.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Sequence of mA4 is Similar to That of A4
mA4 maintained
the specific RNA sequence of A4 without the common
flanking sequences for amplification and with additional random deoxyribonucleotides
at both ends and a poly-T linker at the 5′ end for biotin coupling.
The BLAST25 algorithm showed a good alignment
between the all-DNA versions of the mA4 and A4 aptamers (Figure 1A). This alignment
displayed an expect value of 3 × 10–23 and
a score match of 86.1, with an 83% of cover and 100% of identity between
the 46 common nucleotides. Consequently, mA4 has a similar sequence
to that of A4, with a high-scoring segment. Most of the nucleotides
of the two sequences were identical or homolog. As homolog nucleotides
are able to maintain the function in aptamers with the same sequence,
but different types of sugar in their nucleotides,26 mA4 may retain the binding abilities and affinities of
A4.

and in green indicate guanines. Potential binding domains are PBD
I, PBD II, and PBD III.

2.2 In Silico Prediction of
mA4 Folding Displays
Potential Binding Structures
The most probable secondary
structure of mA4 showed two single strands at the termini, three helical
stems with two asymmetrical internal loops, and a hairpin tetraloop
closed by a guanosine–uridine wobble base pair (Figure 1B). This structure displayed
the lowest free energy (dG = −16.784 kcal/mol) with a GC content
of 49.15%, which increased to 62.07% in the RNA region, and a melting
temperature of 73.6 °C. Compared to A4,15 mA4 showed a free energy only 0.8 kcal/mol higher, one less weak
guanosine–uridine bond, a high percentage of guanosine and
cytosine bases, and a melting temperature 3.1 °C lower than that
of A4. Therefore, mA4 is slightly more unstable than A4, but considering
that its thymine spacer is the main difference between them and that
it makes the mA4 sequence less stable, we ponder that mA4 still is
a stable single-stranded oligonucleotide.

The longest strings
of the two asymmetrical internal loops and the hairpin loop of mA4
share their RNA sequences and consensus motifs with conformations
found in the secondary structure of A4.15 Because secondary structures of aptamers, such as hairpins, bulges,
pseudoknots, G-quadruplexes, and so forth, provide information about
relevant regions of binding because they establish noncovalent interactions
with the target molecule,27,28 we defined three potential
binding domains from the in silico prediction of mA4 folding. Potential
binding domain I (PBD I) consists of nucleotides 25–29, PBD
II consists of nucleotides 33–36, and PBD III consists of nucleotides
44–50 (Figure 1B). The mA4 tertiary structure also shows these three putative binding
sites among the three helical stems (Figure 1C).These common architectural motifs are
crucial, as 3D shapes are responsible for high-affinity noncovalent
bindings between aptamers and their target molecules.29 Consequently, the 59-mer aptamer (mA4) would be able to
bind to PC-3 cells in a similar way to that of the original 55-mer
aptamer (A4).

2.3 mA4 Shows Resistance to
Nucleases under the
Tested Conditions
Prior to the biological assays, the in
vitro stability of mA4 to nucleases was evaluated for 72 h in the
RPMI-1640 medium and Keratinocyte serum-free medium (SFM) used to
culture human tumor prostate PC-3 cells and human nontumor prostate
RWPE-1 cells, respectively. Over this period, its half-life was 4.1
h in RPMI-1640 medium and 1.5 h in Keratinocyte-SFM, showing time-dependent
degradation profiles (Figure 2A). Moreover, the fluorescence of ethidium bromide intercalated
into the nucleotides of mA4 was conserved under the two conditions
analyzed in the agarose gel (Figure 2C). This fact shows that a portion of mA4 remained
undegraded 72 h after its incubation. The degradation of mA4 in Keratinocyte-SFM
was faster than that in RPMI-1640. However, this apparent higher resistance
to nuclease in RPMI-1640 may be put down to the differences in the
nuclease profiles of the media30 rather
than to conformation changes in the aptamer. In addition, mA4 was
coupled with biotin, which would further protect it from nucleases.31

and human

pairs.

mA4 and A4 were also incubated
in human blood plasma to test and
compare their resistance to nucleases present in this biological fluid.
mA4 demonstrated to be almost 25-fold more resistant to nuclease action
than A4 (Figure 2B),
with a half-life of 7.1 h, compared to the half-life of A4 which was
only 0.3 h (18 min) in human plasma. It is remarkable that the staining
profile of A4 fades after 0.5 h (Figure 2D).

Our results are similar to others
comparing RNA and DNA aptamers,
as they are in the same order of magnitude. For example, comparing
anti-thrombin aptamers in human plasma, DNA aptamers were degraded
after 7 h, while RNA aptamers remained only 10 min.32 Apart from the intrinsic higher resistance of DNA to blood
plasma nucleases, the anticoagulant ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA) used in the tubes for blood collection inhibits the action
of endogenous DNases,33 favoring longer
half-lives of present DNAs, including DNA aptamers incubated in blood
plasma. The higher resistance to nuclease of mA4 makes it a better
candidate for a future clinical diagnosis system with blood plasma
as a sample used to detect PCa by liquid biopsy.

2.4 mA4 Binds Specifically to PC-3 Cells
Because the ELASA
is an easy, fast, and cost-effective technique
to monitor the selection process of aptamers, comparable to the traditional
flow cytometry approach,34 we used ELASA
to compare the binding of mA4 and A4 to prostate cell lines used for
A4 selection.

mA4 and A4 showed specificity in their binding,
as both bind to PC-3 cells and do not bind to RWPE-1 cells, in comparison
with the controls (Figure 3). In addition, the absence of the statistical difference
between the binding of A4 and mA4 with PC-3 cells may indicate that
they attach to these cells with comparable forces, in a similar way.
Therefore, mA4 maintains the binding specificity of A4 to prostate
cells.

apta-sorbent assay with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase
. (A) Absorbance at 492 nm of PC-3 cells. (B) Absorbance at 492 nm

A4, and aptamer mA4, both at a concentration of 2 μM. The data
represent the means ± standard errors of the means of three independent
experiments, run in triplicate. Data from cells incubated with aptamers
were normalized subtracting the mean of the absorbance of the same
cells incubated only with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase.
The data were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis
test with the Dunn post-test, *p < 0.05.

Although other studies, such as nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy,
are needed to verify that a modified aptamer has mimetic structures
of the native one,35 our results from the
in silico studies and the ELASA suggest that mA4 may produce a scaffold
on which nucleotides that interact with its molecular target are organized
in structural motifs shared with the original sequence of A4.

2.5 Viability of Prostate Cells Grown under In
Vivo-Like Conditions is Unaffected by mA4
Because different
aptamers need different times to interact with their targets36 and produce a cellular response, we considered
an interval of 48 h which is long enough to assess the potential effects
of mA4 on cell lines. Consequently, these potential effects could
be extrapolated to those of mA4 in a clinical sample tested for diagnosis,
considering the necessary laboratory procedures and handling. In vitro
assays were performed on the epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PC-3,
as they were used in the negative and positive selections of the A4
aptamer, respectively. Although RWPE-1 cells are nonneoplastic human
prostate cells and they represented the nontarget cells, PC-3 cells
are neoplastic human prostate cells and they represented the target
cells, which the aptamer should bind to in a potential diagnostic
or treatment system.

Viability of prostate cells cultured in
magnetic 3D bioprinting was unaffected by the presence of mA4 at concentrations
of 2.5 and 5 μM, after 24 and 48 h of incubation (Figure 4). A4 did not affect the viability
of prostate cells under the tested conditions either (Figure S1).

Figure 4 Effects on prostate cell viability induced
by mA4 in 3D cultures.
(A) Percentage of live PC-3 cells. (B) Percentage of live RWPE-1 cells.
The data represent the means ± standard errors of the means of
two independent experiments, run in triplicate, resulting from a spectrophotometric
neutral red cell viability assay of the prostatic cell lines incubated
with no aptamer (control) and with mA4 at 2.5 and 5 μM for 24
and 48 h. The data were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis
test with Dunn post-test for PC-3 cells and the one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test with Tukey post-test for RWPE-1 cells, *p < 0.05.

Despite cell viability
remaining an issue for CTC isolation methods
that use aptamers for diagnosis from human fluids, it is hard to find
in the literature, cell viability tests with aptamers for diagnostic
use. Contrary to our findings, most aptamers trigger cell death responses
when they bind to their target cells, being used as therapeutic tools
rather than diagnostic ones. For example, anti-EpCAM, anti-CD44, and
bispecific anti-EpCAM-CD44 aptamers, at concentrations up to 4 μM,
reduced the viability of ovarian tumor cell lines, which was correlated
to the expression of these targets in the cells, after 72 h of incubation.37

The fact that mA4 did not kill its target
cells PC-3 means that
it could be used as a diagnostic tool reporting the presence of a
molecular biomarker. If needed and tested, mA4 could report such a
biomarker for a long period after its binding, as it does not kill
the bearing cell. Besides being used as a diagnostic tool, this result
does not exclude its use as a therapeutic tool. However, mA4 would
need to be coupled with a drug to act as a targeted drug delivery
system.

2.6 Prostatic Cells Proliferate at Their Normal
Rate in the Presence of mA4 in an In Vivo-Like System
As
cell viability is intimately related to cell proliferation, but not
all viable cells are dividing, we tested cell proliferation of our
prostate cell lines. PC-3 and RWPE-1 cells also maintained their proliferation
ability (Figure 5),
after incubation with mA4 for 48 h. Similar to our results, the incubation
of the aptamer AS1411 with its target hepatocarcinoma cells failed
to show significant differences in their proliferation profile at
a concentration twice as high as the maximum concentration used by
us, whereas when this aptamer was modified with the replacement of
two internal thymines by two 5-(N-naphthylcarboxyamide)-2′-deoxyuridines
to increase its affinity to its target nucleolin, it decreased the
proliferation of these cells under the same conditions.38 Therefore, modifications that improve the interaction
between aptamers and their targets could induce biological changes
in target cells.

in 3D cultures.
(A) Fluorescence intensity of dividing PC-3 cells. (B) Fluorescence
intensity of dividing RWPE-1 cells. The data represent the means ±
standard errors of the means of two independent experiments, run in
triplicate, resulting from a fluorimetric CytoSelect cell proliferation
assay of the prostatic cell lines incubated with no aptamer (control)
and with mA4 at 2.5 and 5 μM for 24 and 48 h. The data were
statistically analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn
post-test for PC-3 cells and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test with Tukey post-test for RWPE-1 cells, *p <
0.05. Arbitrary units (a. u.).

In contrast to our results of PC-3 cells, most aptamers decrease
cell proliferation when they bind to their target cells whose target
molecules are involved in the signaling of growth factors.36 Thus, our results suggest that if the target
molecule is involved in cell proliferation pathways, either the concentration
of mA4 used in the proliferation assay, the expression of its molecular
target in PC-3 cells, or the interactions between them are not enough
to induce changes in the cell proliferation of PC-3 cells.

However,
the concentrations used were higher to those previously
reported by other researchers. For example, the RA16 aptamer, with
its molecular target unknown, reduced the proliferation of its target
cells NCI-H460 at a concentration of 300 nM,39 six times lower than the highest concentration used in our study.
The U2 aptamer also decreased proliferation of glioblastoma cells
at even lower concentrations, 25 and 50 nM, and after incubation for
24 and 48 h.40 Accordingly, the expression
of the molecular target of mA4 may be low to induce observable changes
in the proliferation of PC-3 cells. Another possibility is that the
interaction between them is too weak and it needs to be enhanced.

2.7 mA4 Does Not Influence Migration of Prostatic
Cell Lines
When these prostate cells were cultured in a monolayer,
under the same conditions, the wound healing assay did not show significant
differences in their migration profile, compared to the controls,
after incubation with mA4 (Figure 6) or A4 (Figure S2) for
24 and 48 h. Although 3D cultures better mimic in vivo conditions
and should be considered the first choice for in vitro tests,41 we did not find an alternative to replace the
wound healing assay which is performed in two-dimensional (2D) cultures.
However, the results of this assay were consistent with those of cell
viability and proliferation that we performed in 3D cultures.

The data represent the means ± standard errors of the means of
two independent experiments, run in triplicate, resulting from a wound
healing assay of the prostatic cell lines incubated with no aptamer
(control) and with mA4 at 2.5 and 5 μM for 24 and 48 h. One-way
analysis of variance with Tukey post-test was used to analyze the
different conditions, *p < 0.05. C. Representative
images of the wound healing assays of the cell lines treated with
5 μM of mA4 after 0, 24, and 48 h. Magnification × 10.
Scale bar 400 μm.

Differently, the aptamer
AXL reduced the migration of the ovary
cancer cells SKOV3-IP1 after 24 and 48 h of incubation at a concentration
of 100 nM.42 The aptamer U2 also decrease
the migration of target glioblastoma multiforme cells, after 8 and
24 h of incubation at 50 nM,40 a concentration
a hundredfold lower than our maximum concentration. Interestingly,
the aptamer CL4, which shares the receptor EGFRvIII as its target
with the aptamer U2, showed that the decrease in the migration of
the target cells depends not only on the presence of the target but
also on the expression of downstream proteins in the signaling pathways
of its target.43 Therefore, we cannot rule
out the chance that the target molecule of mA4 is involved in cell
migration and there is a bypass that could constitutively activate
the corresponding pathway in PC-3 cells. Cell proliferation and migration
share the cellular pathways of microtubule polymerization that are
involved in mitosis, intracellular trafficking, transcription, translation,
and displacement of tumor cells.44 Therefore,
our proliferation and migration results complement each other.

Considering that the binding of mA4 to its targets would inhibit
their functions45 and that we used standard
concentrations of the aptamer when compared to the other studies discussed,
the absence of response in their target cells may indicate that its
molecular target is either little expressed in PC-3 cells, involved
in downstream signaling pathways constitutively activate, or simply
not involved in viability, proliferation, or migration pathways.

3 Conclusions
In the present study, a practical
model was applied to prove the
feasibility of the optimized aptamer mA4 as a probe for in vitro diagnostic
use. Our results indicated a high structural similarity between A4
and mA4, proposing the clinical application of mA4 as a theranostic
tool with potentials in the field of PCa. As 3D cultures display cell
proliferation rates similar to those found in tumor micro-environments,46 in vivo-like 3D magnetic cell cultures were
used for characterization of mA4, which allowed us to increase our
knowledge about mA4 and its interaction with prostatic cells. Because
mA4 bound specifically to tumor prostate cells, is more resistant
than A4 to nuclease present in plasma, and did not affect the behavior
of prostate cells, we determine that mA4 can be directly used in in
vitro diagnostic systems for PCa.

The potential use of mA4 in
other theranostic applications, such
as diagnostic imaging and treatment systems, still requires further
investigation. mA4 did not showed therapeutic action itself against
PCa cells. However, mA4 could be used as a targeted drug carrier,
coupled with a drug, to avoid toxic effects in nontarget cells, which
often limits the effect of treatments.47 As A4 and mA4 bind to PCa cells through molecular targets unknown
to date,15 it would be interesting to identify
the target molecule and its binding region to predict other potential
biological actions of the aptamer in its target cells and to improve
their interaction.48,49 Future findings will hopefully
broaden the clinical applications of mA4.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Aptamers
Integrated DNA Technology
(IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) synthesized mA4 and A4 and biotinylated
them at their 5′ ends. The sequence of the RNA aptamer A4 was
synthesized with its unique nucleotides without the sequences complementary
to the primers used during its selection process (5′GGGCGAGCAGCAGACAGCCGAGAGGUAAGCAAAACCACGCCCGCAUCGUCCUCCC3′).15 This sequence was truncated and deoxyribonucleotides
were added at its ends to design the aptamer mA4 yielding the following
sequence, with the deoxyribonucleotides underlined: 5′TTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGCGAGCAGCAGACAGCCGAGAGGUAAGCAAAACCACGCCCGCAT3′. The sequences of both aptamers were aligned
using BLAST25 to identify common nucleotides.

4.2 In Silico Elucidation of Secondary and Tertiary
Structures
The secondary structure of mA4 was predicted using
the Mfold web server (https://www.idtdna.com/Unafold/Home/Index).50 This secondary structure was translated
into the dot-bracket notation (Vienna format) to be imported to the
RNA Composer web server (http://rnacomposer.ibch.poznan.pl/Home),51 which predicted the tertiary structure
of the RNA form of the aptamer.

The Discovery Studio Visualizer
software (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, v19.1.0.18287, San Diego,
CA, USA) was used to adapt the 3D RNA form of the aptamer to its 3D
chimeric form, with its additional deoxyribonucleotides.

4.3 Aptamer Degradation Assay
Both RPMI-1640
(Cultilab, Campinas, SP, Brazil) and Keratinocyte-SFM (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were supplemented with 100 μg/mL
gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), incubated
with mA4 at a concentration of 33.34 μM at 37 °C for 0,
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h, and then frozen at −80 °C.

Three blood samples were collected in tubes with EDTA (Vacuette
K3EDTA, Greiner Bio-one, Kremsmünster, Austria) from PCa patients,
together with the corresponding informed consent. This experiment
was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University
of Uberlândia (CAAE 71108817.2.0000.5152) in accordance with
all national and local guidelines and regulations.

After venipuncture,
the tubes were centrifuged at 2000g for 15 min at
4 °C and the supernatants were mixed and used
to incubate the aptamers A4 and mA4 separately, at a concentration
of 33.34 μM at 37 °C for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and
24 h. Then, the solutions were frozen at −80 °C.

The degradation of the aptamers at each time and in each diluent
was analyzed after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The bands
were imaged and their intensity were quantified using ImageJ program
(v1.52o, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). A molecular-weight size marker (MM)
of 100 pair bases (DNA Ladder 100 pb, Ludwig Biotecnologia, Alvorada,
RS, Brazil) was used to assist in identifying the aptamers on the
gel. Supplemented media or human blood plasma without aptamers were
used as controls. Data were normalized considering fluorescence intensity
at time 0 h as 100%. Exponential one-phase decay equation was used
to get the half-life of mA4 and A4 under the tested in vitro conditions
by PrismGraph program (GraphPad Software, v.7, La Jolla, CA, USA).

4.4 Cell Cultures
PC-3 (ATCC CRL-1435)
and RWPE-1 (ATCC CRL-11609) human prostate cell lines (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA) were cultured in a monolayer and 3D bioprinting was used
for the in vitro assays. Both cell lines were successfully authenticated
in 2018 by short tandem repeat analysis and monthly tested for mycoplasma
contamination with negative results.

The PC-3 cell line was
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Cultilab, Campinas, SP, Brazil), and
the RWPE-1 cell line was cultured in Keratinocyte-SFM (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Both cell lines were supplemented with
100 μg/mL gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
After trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA solution (Corning,
New York, NY, USA), cells were seeded on either plates for adherent
monolayer cell culture or ultralow adhesion plates (Corning, New York,
NY, USA) for 3D cell culture, according to each assay. Bio Assembler
kits (Nano3D Biosciences, Houston, TX, USA) were used for 3D bioprinting,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

4.5 Enzyme-Linked Apta-sorbent Assay
A day before the experiment,
cells were plated in monolayers, in
96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104. Cells were
blocked with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 5% bovine serum
albumin for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing with PBS and incubation
with 2 μM biotinylated aptamers A4 and mA4 for 1 h at 37 °C.
After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase (SAv-HRP) (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA, USA) diluted (1:250) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were
washed again with PBS, and the peroxidase reaction was initiated by
orthophenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint
Louis, MO, USA) in citrate-phosphate buffer with 3% H2O2 and terminated upon addition of sulphuric acid. The absorbance
of each well was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader to estimate
the binding of the aptamers. In parallel, incubation of cells with
PBS was used as a negative control and incubation of cells with SAv-HRP
in PBS was used for data adjustment.

4.6 Cell
Viability and Proliferation Assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates containing 2 × 103 cells per well and grown
in 3D culture. After 24 h, cells
were treated with the corresponding medium with mA4 at concentrations
of 2.5 and 5 μM and without mA4 (control). Cellular viability
and proliferation were analyzed, after 24 and 48 h of treatment. As
an assay control, cellular viability was also evaluated after incubation
of A4 at a concentration of 2 μM, with an additional death control
with 1% Triton 100-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Fetal bovine serum was not used for these treatments, as it could
degrade the aptamers.

Cellular viability was assessed by an
absorbance-based assay, performed with the neutral red reagent (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Louis, MO, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cellular proliferation was assessed by a fluorescence-based assay,
performed with the CytoSelect cell proliferation assay reagent (Cell
Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.

4.7 Wound Healing Assay
In 12-well plates,
2 × 105 cells per well were grown in monolayers to
full confluence. A longitudinal scratch was made with a sterile pipette
tip at the bottom of each well. Wells were washed with PBS and cells
were treated with the corresponding medium with mA4 at concentrations
of 2.5 and 5 μM and without mA4 (control). As an assay control,
cellular migration was also evaluated after incubation of A4 at a
concentration of 2 μM. Fetal bovine serum was not used for the
treatments, as it could degrade the aptamers.

Images were acquired
using an EVOS inverted microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) at 0, 24, and 48 h after the treatments. The open (wounded)
areas of the images were calculated using the ImageJ program (v1.52o,
NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) to assess cell migration.

4.8 Statistical Analyses
Statistical
analyses were performed by PrismGraph program (GraphPad Software,
v.7, La Jolla, CA, USA). The Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn
post-test or the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Tukey
post-test was used for multiple comparisons according to each set
of data. The value of p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant for all tests.
