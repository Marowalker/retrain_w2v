In
this work, we use density functional theory calculations with
a hybrid exchange–correlation functional and effective core
pseudopotentials to determine the geometry of bare and phosphine-protected
Au8 nanoclusters and characterize their electronic structure.
Au8 clusters were bonded to four and eight PH3 ligands in order to evaluate the effect of ligand concentration
on the electronic structure, while different positional configurations
were also tried for four ligands attached to the cluster. We show
that the neutral clusters become more nucleophilic as the ligands
bind to the clusters at stable sites. The ground-state planar configuration
of Au8 is maintained depending on the concentration and
position of ligands. The effect of ionizing to the +2 charge state
results in disruption of planar geometry in some cases because of
inoccupation of a molecular orbital with the Au–Au bonding
character. Natural bond order charge analyses showed that Au atoms
oxidize upon ionization, instead of phosphine. The net positive charge
makes the clusters more electrophilic with a capacity to absorb electrons
from nucleophiles depending on the concentration and position of ligands
and on the concentration of low-coordinated gold atoms. Besides, ionization
energies and electron affinities were calculated through different
mechanisms, finding that both variables are much higher for charged
systems and change inversely with the concentration of ligands.

Introduction
Since the first publication
about the unexpected catalytic activity
of gold nanoparticles by Haruta1 and Hutchings,2 studies on gold clusters have been increasing
significantly. The efficient catalytic activity of gold-based catalysts,
as demonstrated by the CO to CO2 oxidation at low temperatures,
is related to the small size of the clusters as catalyst deactivation
occurs with cluster sintering.3 The interplay
between the size and the geometric configuration of gold nanoclusters
becomes relevant when clusters are very small. Phase transformations
are expected due to interactions of gold clusters with reducing chemical
environments and charge transfers; in these environments, cluster
nuclearity may change as a result of chemical reactions, such as ligand
exchange.4 Furthermore, 3D configurations
are expected to vanish favoring the stabilization of planar geometries
for small clusters; this transition is likely to occur in gold clusters
with a total number of atoms between 10 and 14 atoms.5 Nevertheless, other reports have identified the change
switch from the planar structure to 3D at Au8 where different
levels of the theory predict either the dominant planar (D2h) geometry or at less common nonplanar
structure (D2d).6 Theoretical calculations have attributed the
stability of planar geometries to relativistic effects in the heavy
gold atom that results in reduction of the s–d energy gap and
s–d hybridizations and orbital overlaps with neighbor atoms.7 Narrow gold cluster size distributions can be
achieved through a combination of nucleation procedures, such as depositing
size-selected gold nanoclusters on metal oxide or carbon substrates8,9 or using metal–ligand complexes as precursors;10,11 specific geometries are also achievable by substituting metals with
other types of metallic atoms in order to suppress isomerization.12 Therefore, the electronic structure and catalytic
behavior of gold clusters can be defined at the synthesis stage.

Small catalyst nanoparticles can be synthesized through deposition
on metal oxide substrates via metal evaporation,13,14 although this type of process results in wide size distributions
of gold nanoclusters.14 Alternatively,
the cluster deposition may take place from liquid solutions of atomically
precise nanoclusters,15,16 which yields narrower distributions.
As a result of liquid phase synthesis processes, ligands bind to outer
gold atoms of the nanoparticles to form charged complexes of ligand-protected
clusters. Typical protecting ligands include thiols, amines, polymers,
and phosphines. Despite stability issues related to weak Au–P
bonds, water-soluble phosphine/gold complexes are commonly produced
because phosphine favors the nucleation of narrow size distributions
of ligand-protected gold clusters, as mentioned above. In addition
to tuning their size by binding with ligands, gold clusters also find
new stable geometries when they interact with ligand molecules, which
are explained by charge transfers resulting from ligand–gold
interactions that weaken Au–Au bonds.17 Ligands are often removed to generate bare metal clusters with exposed
sites for enhanced catalytic activity through certain techniques such
as calcination in a controlled atmosphere,10 heating under vacuum,18 and low-temperature
chemical reactions with peroxides.11 The
catalytic activity of these nanoparticles is related to the cluster
size and geometry and their electronic structure, which is influenced
by the absence, concentration, and configuration of attached ligands.

However, experimental characterization of the electronic structure
in this type of system is still a major challenge, and specific information
for ligand-protected AuX (X < 10) clusters is still limited. The optical absorption spectrum
of thiolated Au25 clusters showed molecular-like transitions
because of quantum size effects.19 Similarly,
electrochemical characterization of small gold nanoparticles has revealed
electron localization and molecule-like electronic behavior and nonzero
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps uncharacteristic of bulk metals.20,21 However, electrodynamic models are not reliable for nanoparticles
with sizes below 5 nm. The superatom model has been used to study
the stability and electronic structure of ligand-protected gold nanoparticles
at energy levels around the HOMO–LUMO gap, explaining delocalization,
orbital contributions near the gap and structural stability due to
occupation of superatom orbitals.22 The
superatom complex model is employed to predict the stability of structures
according to their closed shell requirements. The model has evolved
to present a unified view for ligand-protected gold clusters as superatom
complexes regardless the ligand nature such as thiolate, phosphine,
and halide ligands.23 Thus, for single-shell
clusters, the filling of subshells in an aufbau fashion, that is,
1S2|1P6|1D10|2S21F14|2P61G18|2D103S21H22|..., predicts exceptional stability for spherical
structures with 2, 8, 18, 34, 58, 92, and so forth delocalized electrons
(n*). For (LsAnXm)Z systems, the formula is n* = NνA – M – z, wherein N denotes the number of atoms
of the metal cluster (of type A), and νA denotes the corresponding atomic valence. As already known,
νA = 1 for gold clusters because the delocalized
electrons are mainly derived from the 6s atomic orbitals. M denotes the number of electron-localizing (or electron
withdrawing) ligands—L—(assuming here a withdrawal of
one electron per X), and z is the
overall charge on the complex. In general, phosphine is considered
a weak ligand, which only leads to a steric stabilization of the metal
cluster surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have
predicted the HOMO–LUMO gap of Au11 and Au13 clusters protected by thiol and phosphine ligands stabilized by
halogen or thiolate ligands. The stability was predicted through the
satisfaction of an electronically closed shell superatom complex.
The gaps were computed as 1.5 and 1.8 eV for ligand-protected Au11 and Au13 clusters, respectively, and attributed
to the localization of electrons belonging to the conduction band
by bonding of gold atoms with ligands.24 For cluster sizes closer to our interest, based on the Aun(X)mz+ cluster series (n = 6–9; X = PH3, PMe3, and PPh3),25 a modified electron counting rule for delocalized electrons
for charged phosphine-protected gold clusters: n*
= NνA – M – z + CT, where CT means charge transfer,
was proposed. For the case of the Au8(PH3)m2+ (m = 7 and
8) clusters, this formula led them to calculate 7.7 and 7.2 delocalized
valence electrons with Bader charges and 7.6 and 7.4 delocalized valence
electrons with NPA charges, respectively. This means numbers differ
from the number expected as calculated with the counting rule without
the CT effect (n* = 6). Mollenhauer and Gaston mainly
support this modification on the differences observed between the
molecular orbital diagrams and projected local density of states of
the bared clusters and the gold clusters protected by phosphine ligands.
Nevertheless, more detailed information about molecular orbitals at
energy levels below HOMO is needed for a complete electronic structure
characterization, which is not achievable through the superatom model.
Although other computational and theoretical works have studied ligand-protected
clusters of different sizes26,27 and have predicted
the effect of ligands chemical composition24 and orientation22 on the electronic structure
and stability, information about the influence of concentration and
position of ligands in Au clusters on the electron transition variables
and catalytic activity clusters has not been extensively reported.

In this work, we use DFT calculations with the hybrid exchange–correlation
functional and effective core pseudopotentials (ECPs) to determine
the geometry of bare and phosphine-protected Au8 nanoclusters
and characterize their electronic structure. The electronic density
of states (DOS), charge distributions, orbital occupation and energetics,
electron affinities (EA), and ionization energies (IE) are calculated
for the optimized structures, which were confirmed as minima.

Computational
Methods
DFT calculations are performed as implemented in
the Gaussian09
program.28 M0629 was chosen as the exchange–correlation functional, which
belongs to the family of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
that includes second derivatives of the electron density (meta-GGA).30,31 This functional has been used in previous studies for the characterization
of the Kohn–Sham wave functions of gold clusters18 because its parameterization was carried out
to represent chemical properties of transition metals.32 The M06 functional has been also employed to
describe activation energies for molecule oxidation on Au8 clusters, specifically.33 Despite this
article does not intend to evaluate activation energies, the prediction
of the catalytic behavior is still a motivation to conduct this study.
Therefore, M06 represents a proper choice that leaves a room for the
continuity of this work. It is known that local spin-density approximation
functionals predict better bond lengths in transition-metal dimers
than GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals; however, they also significantly
overestimate binding energies.27 The DZ
basis set with 9s and 5p primitive Gaussian functions (D95)34 is selected to expand the electron wave functions
for phosphorous and hydrogen atoms, whereas the Wood–Boring
quasirelativistic pseudopotential (MWB)35 is used to represent the core electrons of gold atoms, as defined
by the Stuttgart–Dresden (SDD)36−39 ECPs formalism. A very tight
convergence criterion for the solution of linear equations is used
along with self-consistent field iterations, while the ionic positions
are optimized thorough the so-called “Berny” algorithm40,41 with a tight force cutoff. Kick42 software
is used to generate potential-starting geometries of the bare Au8 cluster through a stochastic search over the potential energy
surface (PES). A concise explanation of what the Kick code is and
its main characteristics are detailed in the Supporting Information. The most stable geometry found for the bare Au8 cluster is initially optimized, and PH3 molecules
are then put in the proximity of gold atoms in selected symmetrical
positions. The gold atoms are classified as either two-fold (outer)
and four-fold (inner) according to their coordination and position
in the ground-state planar configuration of the Au8 cluster;
thus, there is a maximum of eight binding sites in the planar bare
cluster (four outer and four inner). In order to analyze the effect
of ligand concentration and position, 4 × PH3 and
8 × PH3 ligands are bonded to the Au8 clusters;
in the case of 4PH3, the four ligands are put close to
either all outer or all inner binding sites and then optimized, whereas
all binding sites (outer and inner) are occupied in the optimizations
of clusters with 8PH3 ligands.

Although ligands as
large as Ph2P(o-tolyl)11 and PPh343,44 are employed to stabilize
experimentally gold clusters, we chose
the smaller PH3 ligand because it is suitable enough for
mimicking the results expected with PPh3 as reported in
previous studies.45−47 For example, for Aun(PX3)mz+ (X = H, Me, and Ph) systems, electronic parameters such as charge
transfer and the HOMO–LUMO gap have been found with very similar
values, demonstrating that the ligand change has nearly no influence
on the cluster structure and nature. On the other hand, the steric
stabilization provided by the phenyl part of triphenylphosphine is
neglected by using PH3 ligands,48 which in turn would require a better description of the dispersion
due to π interactions. As a consequence, the binding energy
changes up to 5 and 11 kcal/mol when the dispersion correction is
included for neutral and plus one-charged Au–PPh3 and Au2PPh3 complexes.48 However, we did not consider an additional dispersion correction
for our DFT method because we were looking for structural changes
and electronic behavior and qualitative energy trends.

The procedure
is performed for bare and ligand-protected clusters
with excess and lack of electrons in the systems with the purpose
of analyzing the oxidation effect on the catalytic activity and for
the calculation of ionization variables. Furthermore, the set of simulations
was repeated for doubly charged systems (2+), with eight ligands and
the two possible configurations for four ligands and with lack and
excess of electrons for ionization energy (IE) and EA calculations.
Ligand–cluster binding energies were also calculated for neutral
and doubly ionized systems as Eb = (Esystem – (Ecluster + Eligand))/N, where N is the number of ligands. All energies included in the
binding energy equation are obtained after a full optimization is
performed and a global minimum is found. The binding energy calculated
for charged ligand-protected clusters takes the optimized energy of
the charged unprotected cluster as a reference along with the optimized
energy for the neutral phosphine. Vibrational frequency calculations
are performed to ensure that the minimized structures correspond to
true minima.

The adiabatic IEs and EAs are calculated from the
energies of the
optimized structure of the reference system (Esystem) and the energies of the optimized clusters in excess
or lack of one electron (+1e– and −1e–, respectively). This means that a new minimum is found
in PES after an electron is added or removed from the reference systems.
IE and EA are calculated according to the following equations 1   2  

Results and Discussion
Bare Au8 Clusters
DFT calculations were
performed initially on bare Au8 clusters; the initial geometry
was set to be planar according to theoretical works reported elsewhere
and conformational searches were performed through the methods implemented
in Kick software for exploration of the PES.42 After the total energy minimization, the ground-state configuration
resulted in a planar configuration (D4h) in agreement with previous reports.5,6 The geometry of the optimized bare cluster is characterized by an
inner set of atoms arranged in a four-fold hollow (square) configuration
with sides of 2.865 Å, while the remaining four gold atoms relax
outside the perimeter of the inner square with each outer gold atom
lying equidistant (2.865 Å) to two inner gold atoms to form a
three-fold hollow (triangle) (Figure 1a). The natural bond orbital (NBO) charge analysis
represented in Figure 1a shows that despite the initial neutrality of the bare cluster,
the negative charges are slightly shifted toward the core of the cluster,
leaving the outer gold atoms with a small net positive charge. These
results start hinting about possible stable binding sites for ligands
because PH3 behaves as a nucleophile. Figure 1b shows the total electron
DOS (TDOS) including the partial contribution of each type of orbital
to the total density (PDOS). Unlike bulk gold, an energy gap between
the HOMO and the LUMO is expected in small clusters such as Au8. This is observed in Figure 1b, where the TDOS line, and therefore all PDOS lines,
vanish through the Fermi level opening a band gap of ∼2.8 eV;
this feature is in agreement with reports demonstrating nonzero gaps
for gold nanoclusters, which increase as the clusters become smaller.21,22,49 As expected from the electron
configuration of gold, the S type of orbitals represent a major contribution
to the HOMO and LUMO, as seen from the red line approaching the black
line at the HOMO energy level in Figure 1b. Conversely, the green line almost superimposes
the black line in the range −12 to −7 eV, indicating
that D orbitals have the greatest contribution at eigenvalues at lower
energy levels. It can be observed from the inset of Figure 1b that both the HOMO (left)
and LUMO (right) of the neutral Au8 cluster have a significant
presence around the outer gold atoms, which defines potential sites
to act as ligand receptors.

Au8(PH3)4,8 Clusters
The
optimized structure of the Au8 neutral cluster was
used to investigate binding of different number of phosphine ligands
to various binding sites, as shown in Figure 2. For all calculations, the PH3 ligands were initially placed with the P atoms lying within a bonding
radius with Au atoms, with the H atoms pointing in the opposite direction.
It was initially assumed that energy minimization through the PES
would result in an overlap of Au and P atomic orbitals to form Au–P
bonds. On the contrary, DFT optimizations showed that the formation
of Au bonds depends on the concentration of ligands around the cluster
and that the stability of the planar geometry of the neutral cluster
is related to both the concentration and the binding sites of ligands
surrounding the cluster. For instance, the Au8 cluster
bonded to eight phosphine ligands (Au8(PH3)8) maintains the initial planar geometry. However, the phosphine
ligands in the proximity of inner gold atoms lose the Au–P
bond redefining the orientation of phosphine, with three of the four
P atoms optimized to be pointing outward from the gold cluster (Figure 2). The low stability
of the inner position is confirmed by the optimized geometry of the
Au8(PH3)4-inner, which causes
a cluster core rearrangement to nonplanar geometry before phosphine
could relax at the vicinity of gold atoms initially located at inner
sites. In the case with the four ligands attached to outer binding
sites (Au8(PH3)4-outer), there
is negligible reorganization from the initial cluster geometry, and
a great structural stability can be inferred from this symmetrical
configuration with four ligands closely interacting with outer gold
atoms (Figure 2). The
NBO charge distribution reported in Figure 1a already evidenced electrophilic binding
sites at outer gold atoms. Thus, phosphine ligands with an unshared
pair of electrons are attracted to these sites rather than more nucleophilic
inner gold atoms, which explains the binding energy per ligand −0.76
eV obtained for Au8(PH3)4-outer, the most negative value found for neutral systems (Figure 2). Furthermore, the presence
of LUMO around outer Au and away of inner Au atoms (right inset in Figure 1b) provides insights
about the instability of Au8(PH3)4-inner. Although it has been demonstrated that highly coordinated gold
atoms can accept a lone pair of electrons from phosphine,47 the high coordination of inner gold atoms leaves
less empty states to be occupied by the free pair of electrons from
PH3, compared to the outer gold atoms. This forces either
phosphine ligands to relax at outer Au sites maintaining the cluster
geometry or the cluster to reconstruct in order to find the ground
state. This reconstruction lowers the energy significantly yielding
a binding energy of −0.75 eV for Au8(PH3)4-inner, very similar to Au8(PH3)4-outer. At high concentration of ligands
[i.e., Au8(PH3)8], the occupation
of outer sites makes the inner sites very unstable, leading to a steric
repulsion of ligands instead of a structural reconstruction of the
planar cluster, as seen in Figure 2. The binding energy per ligand calculated for Au8(PH3)8 is consequently the less negative
for the neutral systems, −0.58 eV.

Figure 2 Initial and optimized
structures of Au8 clusters protected
by PH3 ligands at different concentrations and positions.
The charge of these systems is zero. Yellow spheres correspond to
gold atoms, whereas orange and white spheres represent phosphorous
and hydrogen atoms of the phosphine, respectively. Binding energies
per ligand (Eb) are reported for each
configuration.

It is worth noting that
Au8(PH3)4-outer and Au8(PH3)4-inner clusters
have very different structures but almost degenerated, the first one
maintained the planar structure of the gold cluster but the second
one is evidently 3D geometry. Then, the degeneracy should be expected
to appear for different configurations at a saturated regime as observed
in this case when four ligands are considered instead of the eight
ligands to saturate the eight gold atoms. An example of the SH2 and PH3 ligand effect is reported by Guedes-Sobrinho
et al.47 in a DFT study of three configurations
of Au55 and Pt55 nanoclusters: icosahedron (ICO),
cuboctahedron, and the low-symmetry putative global minimum configuration,
which has been called distorted reduced core (DRC). Interestingly,
the DRC structure as the most stable at the gas phase becomes nearly
degenerated in energy in comparison with the ICO structure when protected
by 18 ligands, which they attributed to an enhancement in the stabilization
induced by the release of the core strain energy.

The electron
DOS decomposed into individual contributions of all
atoms in Au8(PH3)4-outer and
is plotted along with the total electron DOS (TDOS) in the Figure 3. The green line
represents the overlap of the partial DOS (OPDOS) of phosphorous onto
the gold. As seen in Figure 3, the HOMO has the Au–P antibonding character because
the green line becomes negative at the HOMO energy level. The shape
and location of the HOMO (inset molecular orbital at bottom) corresponds
to an antibonding molecular orbital mainly located around the outer
Au atoms and P atoms. The LUMO (inset molecular orbital at top-right),
on the other hand, has the nonbonding character between gold atoms,
which is confirmed by the OPDOS becoming zero at the LUMO energy level.
The LUMO does not affect the bonding nature of the ligated cluster
unless reduction takes place. Besides the HOMO, the electronic state
of the HOMO – 1 also presents the antibonding character, as
indicated by the negative green peak at about −5.5 eV in Figure 3. These two antibonding
molecular orbitals are occupied, and one would expect the cluster
to structurally collapse as a result but this does not occur after
optimization. Nearly degenerate bonding molecular orbitals at lower
energy levels are then responsible for keeping the structural integrity
of Au8(PH3)4-outer, as inferred
from the positive green peak between −10 and −11 eV.
One of those molecular orbitals is shown in the inset of Figure 3 (top left), where
not only the bonding character between Au and P atoms is verified
but also electron delocalization among gold atoms that provides a
bonding interaction between outer and inner gold atoms and significant
structural stability. Because these bonding orbitals are beneath the
HOMO energy, it is expected that the structure of Au8(PH3)4-outer will maintain its highly symmetrical
planar structure upon chemical oxidation because excitation from antibonding
states will not affect the Au–P bonding interactions. Reduction,
on the other hand, may cause some kind of structure deformation or
Au bond stretch/breaking because nonbonding empty electron states
would become filled or partially filled. The DOS plots for Au8(PH3)4-inner are reported in
the Supporting Information and show the
three Au–P antibonding states at the HOMOs (HOMO, HOMO –
1, and HOMO – 2); this supports the poor binding between Au
and P in the inner configuration compared to the outer configuration
in Au8(PH3)4.

Figure 3 Electron DOS for the
optimized structure of Au8(PH3)4-outer.
Inset molecular orbitals correspond to
the bonding orbital 65 with an energy of ∼−10.70 eV
(top left), the antibonding HOMO (bottom), and the LUMO (top right),
showing nonbonding character between Au and P. The OPDOS (green line)
represents the overlap DOS between the Au and P atoms.

The partial and TDDOS curves for Au8(PH3)8 are shown in Figure 4. The highest energy levels including the
LUMO, the HOMO,
and the state just under the HOMO are all antibonding between the
Au and P atoms (i.e., the green OPDOS line is negative). Similar to
Au8(PH3)4-outer, lower energy
molecular orbitals are the ones responsible for holding the planar
geometry of Au8(PH3)8 through strong
binding between Au and P, and inner and outer Au. However, those energetically
close states spread under the high TDOS peak in Figure 4 (−11 to −9.5 eV) also present
contributions from overlap of phosphorous and hydrogen molecular orbitals,
as seen from the cyan and blue lines overlapping in that range. From
the optimized structure of Au8(PH3)8 reported in Figure 2, it is inferred that only one of the inner phosphine ligands is
forming a bond with a gold atom. This is confirmed by the inset molecular
orbital shown in Figure 4 at left bottom, which clearly showcases the bonding overlap between
particular P and Au atoms and is supported by the green line becoming
slightly positive at that energy level. No other bonding molecular
orbitals involving inner phosphine ligands are seen, which confirms
the instability of these binding sites, especially when outer positions
have been filled. A second OPDOS is drawn in Figure 4, corresponding to the overlap of molecular
orbitals of outer and inner gold atoms and aims to account for structure
stability defined by Au-inner/Au-outer interactions. This purple line
becomes positive at states near the HOMO, defining a bonding interaction
between outer and inner gold. The density surface of the HOMO shown
in the inset of Figure 4 (top) indicates that this molecular orbital is indeed overlapping
outer and inner gold atoms covering the three-fold hollow sites formed
by two inner gold and one outer Au. The source of planar stability
at high concentration of phosphine ligands might be related to the
geometrical symmetry of this high energy molecular orbital, although
it is necessary to remark that the purple line becomes negative between
−5.5 and −8 eV defining antibonding interactions at
lower energy levels.

bonding orbital with an energy of ∼−10.50 eV (bottom
left) and the antibonding HOMO (top).

Figure 5 shows
the
electrostatic potential mapped onto the total electron density of
the bare Au8 cluster and all three ligand-protected clusters.
With a planar geometry of the Au atoms, the electronic charges are
symmetrically distributed along the defined plane. The electrostatic
potential surface for Au8 confirms the higher EA of outer
gold atoms compared to Au atoms forming the inner square. The positive
electrostatic potential represented by the dark blue regions delimits
electrophilic zones, where the cluster is susceptible to chemical
attack by nucleophiles such as phosphine. As discussed above, outer
gold sites are the most stable sites for phosphine binding providing
strong Au interaction and stabilizing the planar geometry. When the
symmetrical planar structure is maintained, the charges coming from
the unshared pair of electrons of phosphine distribute over the planar
cluster creating nucleophilic areas at the hollow sites of the cluster,
as shown by the red regions of the electrostatic potential of Au8(PH3)8 and Au8(PH3)4-outer in Figure 5. Neutral Au8(PH3)4-inner does not keep the symmetrical planar structure of the cluster with
occupied outer sites, and therefore, its irregular binding behavior
leads to a limited charge transfer from the ligand to the gold cluster.
The smaller red region of the electrostatic potential of Au8(PH3)4-inner is indicative of less reduction
of gold atoms upon interaction with phosphines in comparison with
Au8(PH3)8 and Au8(PH3)4-outer. Furthermore, the surface profiles
of the electrostatic potential reported in Figure 5 also provide clues about the different chemical
behavior that may exist among clusters with different concentrations
and configurations of ligands. Planar ligand-protected clusters present
a larger and more exposed negative region of the potential on which
electrophiles, or positively charged species, can approach from perpendicular
directions to the cluster plane. The surface of the planar clusters
(Au8(PH3)8 and Au8(PH3)4-outer) becomes a reduction site capable
of providing electrons, which principally come from the phosphine
ligands. Consequently, it is expected that the ionization energy diminishes
as the concentration of ligands bonded to gold atoms of the cluster
increases, as will be discussed later. Au8(PH3)4-inner, on the other hand, presents a limited
negative electrostatic potential sterically obstructed by ligands
bonded to out-of-plane gold atoms, making it less active for reduction
of molecules. However, it is important to remark the small range of
the color map of the electrostatic potentials (−0.07 to 0.07),
which evidences a not too strong potential but rather shows a slight
charge redistribution as a consequence of Au–PH3 interactions.

Doubly Ionized Au8(PH3)4,8 Clusters
The synthesis of
phosphine-stabilized Au clusters in the liquid
phase results in ionized clusters, an example being Au8(PPh3)82+43 and Au8(PPh3)82+.50 These structures have the gold atoms in 3D geometry;
thus, Au8(PPh3)72+ exhibits
an icosahedron-five-vertices shape, while Au8(PPh3)82+ shows a bicapped centered chair shape.
The synthesis of the charged ligand-protected Au8 clusters
with less number of ligands has led to clusters with six ligands such
as [Au8(dppp)4Cl2]2+,
dppp = 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane.51 Its single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the hexafluorophosphate
salt revealed that the cluster core had di-edge-bridged bitetrahedral
geometry. This permitted it to exhibit a prolate shape, which is in
accordance with n* = 4. Besides, in 2013, Kobayashi
et al. synthesized a series of [core + exo]-type
Au8 clusters bearing two alkynyl ligands on the exo gold atoms [Au8(dppp)4(C≡CR)2]2+ by the reaction of [Au8(dppp)4]2+ with alkynyl anions.52 The [Au8(dppp)4]2+ (dppp = 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane)51 cluster synthetized for the first time by Kamei
et al. founded that the cluster core adopted edge-shared tri-tetrahedral
motifs based on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of its structure.51 Calculating n*, its value is n* = 6; this is an oblate distortion explained by the s2p4 molecular orbitals according to the superatomic
complex model.23

Despite the information
above and the usual way to obtain the start geometries for modeling
the charged ligand-protected clusters, that is, from the X-ray data,
we choose to start from the neutral and flat gold structure.

In order to study the electron structure and predict the chemical
behavior of ionized clusters, two electrons are removed from each
one of the optimized neutral systems studied previously. The deficit
of electrons results in a geometry modification of Au8(PH3)8, which is not observed in the corresponding
neutral system (Figure 6). The lack of two electrons and the consequential inoccupation of
the HOMO produce a gold cluster prone to lose its planar stability
in the presence of phosphine ligands at unstable binding sites, which
is supported by recent studies with Au4 where the positive
charge induces 2D–3D geometry transitions.53 This result is expected from the analysis of DOS and molecular
orbitals of the equivalent neutral clusters. Figure 4 shows the HOMO as a bonding molecular orbital
between outer and inner Au, whereas the rest of overlap states (purple
line) correspond to nonbonding or antibonding orbitals. Losing two
electrons results in total inoccupation of the bonding HOMO and the
consequential loss of structural symmetry in Au8(PH3)8. The high stability of Au8(PH3)4-outer is proven as its geometry remains
unaltered by the positive charge. The high bonding character between
gold molecular orbitals at low energy levels (−10.70 eV) shown
in Figure 3 contributes
to maintain the symmetrical planar structure of Au8(PH3)4-outer upon ionization. Similar to the
neutral systems, the outer configuration produces the lowest Au–PH3 binding energy among all charged ligand-protected clusters,
with −2.29 eV, as shown in Figure 6. Conversely, the charged Au8(PH3)4-inner cluster keeps planar geometry slightly
different from the initial configuration but with most of phosphines
optimizing attached to outer gold atoms or with inner gold atoms moving
closer to the phosphine to stabilize the Au–P bond at inner
positions (Figure 6). The charged inner configuration produces a higher binding energy
per ligand (−1.97 eV) compared to the outer configuration but
still lower than the binding energy per ligand of Au8(PH3)8 (−1.71 eV). As described earlier, the
binding energy of charged systems is calculated, taking the energy
of the charged unprotected cluster as a reference along with the energy
of the neutral phosphine. This calculation represents a fair approximation
to the exact binding energy because the two electrons removed from
the ligand-protected clusters come principally from gold atoms, resulting
in a net loss of nearly two electrons in the metal cluster (Figure 7). This approach
is also in agreement with previous computational studies for ligand-protected
Au clusters.11,54

Although our approximation does not follow the common way
to obtain
the initial structure of the charged ligand-protected clusters, that
is, from the X-ray data, the particular distances Au–Au and
Au–P agree very well with the reported values from the X-ray
data, see Table 1.
However, the bicapped centered chair shape was not obtained, but a
3D geometry of the gold core was characterized. It is also worth noting
that our % error is smaller in comparison with these specific results
found by Mollenhaueer and Gaston who optimized the same type of the
cluster but with triphenylphosphine.

The NBO analysis of charges in Figure 7 provides useful
information about the effect
of ligands on the potential chemical reactivity of Au8.
As mentioned above, the ionization that results from the liquid phase
synthesis comes principally from the oxidation of gold atoms, which
become electrophilic centers prone to accept electrons from nucleophilic
molecules. Furthermore, differences in the coordination number of
these positively charged atoms define their EA and reactivity. Four
phosphine ligands in inner positions result in the displacement of
three ligands toward two of the four outer gold atoms [see Au8(PH3)42+-inner in Figure 6]. This
displacement leads to an increase in coordination of outer gold atoms,
producing three and four coordination sites for outer gold atoms that
initially had two coordination sites. Outer gold atoms that remained
two-coordinate exhibited the most positive charge in the cluster (see
Au8(PH3)42+-inner in Figure 7), which
turn them into a potential spot for adsorption of nucleophiles and
electron transfer. Conversely, four ligands in outer configuration
(see Au8(PH3)42+-outer in Figure 7) relax
at the initial positions increasing the coordination to outer gold
atoms from two to three and creating a steric obstruction for axial
binding of approaching molecules. Au8(PH3)42+-outer is expected to have
a lower reactivity compared to Au8(PH3)42+-inner because the electron
transfer pathways are enhanced in the inner configurations. The higher
concentration of phosphine ligands provides the electrons to convert
Au8(PH3)82+ into a less
positive and nonplanar cluster with higher coordination of all its
gold atoms. Therefore, the NBO charge analysis suggest that Au8(PH3)82+ is a weaker oxidizing
agent than Au8(PH3)42+, regardless of the structural configuration. This information is
supported by the electrostatic maps in the Supporting Information (Figure S2) in which positive charges are more
homogeneously distributed than in Au8(PH3)42+, with Au8(PH3)42+-inner exhibiting the sharpest positive
charge distribution among all the charged clusters and positive electrostatic
zones around low-coordinated gold atoms. Similarly, the Mulliken population
analysis reported in Figure S3 shows a
qualitative agreement with the NBO charges, supporting the analysis
of potential binding sites on charged clusters.

Figure 8 shows the
electron density space of the HOMO (Figure 8a) and LUMO (Figure 8b) for the three charged clusters. The occupation
of energy levels by remaining electrons determines the stability and
activity of positively charged nanoclusters. According to the representation
of the HOMO of Au8(PH3)42+-outer (Figure 8a), there is significant electron delocalization among
outer and inner gold atoms which holds the symmetrical planar geometry
and provides stability to charged Au8. The LUMO of Au8(PH3)42+-outer (Figure 8b), related
to the EA, is mainly localized around outer gold atoms. However, the
outer atoms are protected by PH3 ligands in this configuration,
and a lower reactivity is expected because of steric obstruction for
nucleophiles approaching the protected outer gold atoms. The HOMO
(Figure 8a) and LUMO
(Figure 8b) of Au8(PH3)42+-inner, has significant electron density around the lowest coordinated
gold atoms, which were shown to keep the most positive charge. The
low bond order along with the positive charge and lack of steric obstruction
by PH3 ligands predicts a higher activity for oxidation
for the inner configuration of the charged ligand-protected Au8. Molecules with unshared pairs of electrons approaching Au8(PH3)42+-inner will have the chance to form bonds by filling unoccupied molecular
orbitals. Au8(PH3)82+ loses
planar geometry and finds stability with large electron delocalization
among gold atoms at the HOMO energy level [Au8(PH3)82+ in Figure 8a]. The LUMO of Au8(PH3)82+ (Figure 8b) presents high bonding overlap among gold atoms and antibonding
Au–P overlap; this is also seen in the OPDOS in Figure 9 (vide infra). The location
of this molecular orbital has no easy access for approaching molecules
that are willing to provide electrons because all PH3 ligands
are bonded to each one of the gold atoms in a nonplanar configuration,
creating a three-dimensional steric barrier. This is contrary to what
is seen in neutral Au8(PH3)8, which
has a planar configuration and PH3 ligands do not hinder
species approaching the cluster from a normal direction to the plane.
At the HOMO energy level, there is nonbonding and antibonding behavior
evident between gold and phosphorous atoms, which suggest Au–P
bonding orbitals are occupied at lower energy levels as occurs in
the case of neutral ligand-protected clusters.

line), and overlap (OPDOS) partial DOS for charged ligand-protected
Au8 clusters. The OPDOS (green line) represents the overlap
DOS between the Au and P atoms.

The plot of the electron DOS reported in Figure 9 shows the positive overlap
of Au and P molecular
orbitals at low energy levels for all charged ligand-protected clusters,
as seen by the green line becoming positive well below the HOMO energy
level (between −19 and −15 eV). This orbital overlap
confirms the strong bonding between gold and phosphorous as a result
of metal oxidation and increase of electrostatic interaction. As in Figure 1, the vertical dashed
and dash-dotted lines in Figure 9 show the location of the HOMO and the LUMO, respectively.
It is noted that both the HOMO and LUMO are shifted toward lower (more
negative) energy levels as the concentration of ligands also decrease,
finding a minimum at the bare Au82+ cluster.

Charge Transfer and Its Relationship with the Cluster Stability
Employing the modified electron counting rule for delocalized electrons
for charged phosphine-protected gold clusters proposed by Mollenhauer
and Gaston,25 the charge transfer was calculated
for every analyzed system. The charge transfer from the ligand shell
to the cluster is the lost charge by all phosphine molecules, see Table 2. As usually found,
the atomic charge distribution depends on the method used. For example,
the charge transfers calculated with NBO are bigger than the values
obtained with Mulliken. However, the general analysis of the charge
transfer, and therefore of the delocalized electrons and its relationship
with the cluster stability, is mostly the same for both methods. As
expected, the charged transfer was bigger in charged systems than
in the corresponding neutral systems. Thus, the more the negative
binding energy (more stable) was, more charge was transferred. Regarding
the delocalized electron number, the expected numbers were n* = 8 and n* = 6 for neutral and charged
systems because the phosphine ligand effect is considered only as
steric stabilization. Nonetheless, considering the charge transfer,
those numbers become different to whole numbers and higher than 8
or 6 and in all cases. We found a very similar value for the delocalized
electron number (n* = 7.1, considering Mulliken charges)
for Au8(PH8)2+ in comparison with
the value calculated by Mollenhauer and Gaston (n* = 7.2, considering Bader charges). Then, it is possible to infer
that the charge transfer mostly depends on the ligand numbers and
the cluster charge more than on the observed specific 3D gold arrangement.
It was also observed by Guedes-Sobrinho et al.47 who explained the same stability of Au55 and
Pt55 nanoclusters at the limit of 18 ligands (DRC and ICO
structure) based on the charge transfer from phosphine ligands to
the metal cluster as mentioned above.

IEs and EAs
There is an intrinsic relationship between
the energy values of molecular orbitals neighboring the Fermi level
and some electron transition variables. The negative of the HOMO energy
level is related to the vertical IE, whereas the negative of the LUMO
energy approximates to the vertical EA.55 Unlike, the adiabatic electron transition energies calculated by eqs 1 and 2, the vertical IEs and EAs would be obtained from single-point calculations
of systems with excess or lack of electrons. As seen from Figure 9 and Table 3, the negative of LUMO energy
of the cluster (related to the vertical EA) increases as the concentration
of ligands decreases; this indicates that a stronger activity for
oxidation is expected for lower ligand concentration and even stronger
for the bare charged clusters. On the other hand, as the concentration
of ligands increases, the negative of HOMO energy (related to the
vertical IE) becomes lower, which means that less energy is required
to remove an electron from the ligand-protected cluster, turning the
cluster into a potentially active catalyst for reduction of electrophiles.
It is important to remark that at some concentration of ligands (Au8(PH3)42+), the inner configuration
presents a higher adiabatic EA than the outer configuration, which
is expected from the higher concentration of low-coordinated and positively
charged gold atoms present in the inner configuration, as reported
in Figure 7. These
results suggest that a less stable configuration might have better
chemical reactivity if we consider that the outer configuration presents
stronger Au–P binding. However, there is a negligible difference
between the IEs of both structural configurations of Au8(PH3)42+, which means the band gap
also differs from outer to inner configuration, as seen in Figure 9 and Table 3.

The HOMO–LUMO gap values for charged and neutral
systems
are reported in Table 3. The band gap values show an increasing conducting behavior in charged
clusters as the concentration of ligands decreases. For neutral clusters,
on the contrary, the band gap drops as ligand concentration increases,
only if Au8(PH3)4 takes the inner
configuration; however, neutral Au8(PH3)4-outer is the most stable of both Au8(PH3)4 configurations, and it yields the lowest band
gap among all protected and unprotected neutral clusters. HOMO–LUMO
gaps are more related to optical properties and electron conductivity
than reactivity. The energy values of HOMO and LUMO by themselves
provide more information about reactivity and capacity to transfer
and absorb electrons. The second and third columns in Table 3 report the negative of HOMO
and LUMO, respectively. In general, the HOMO and LUMO present lower
values for neutral clusters than for charged ones. This is explained
from the amount of energy required to remove an electron from a neutral
cluster, which should be lower than the energy to remove an electron
from a positively charged system. Also, the amount of energy released
upon electron absorption is expected to be larger for positively charged
clusters in comparison with neutral ones. Adiabatic IEs and adiabatic
EAs were also calculated and reported in the columns 4 and 5 of Table 3. As noted from the
values reported for neutral systems, IE and EA are comparable to negative
HOMO and LUMO, respectively. As seen from the data reported in Table 3, adiabatic electron
transition variables and HOMO–LUMO energies yielded quite similar
values, supporting the previous analysis of IE and EA as a function
of concentration and configuration of ligands. The minimization of
doubly charged clusters over the PES does not alter the qualitative
general trend of increasing EA and IE as the concentration of ligands
decreases. For Au8(PH3)42+ clusters, the inner configuration presented higher adiabatic EA,
as expected from the negative values of the LUMO (i.e., vertical EAs).
As mentioned above, the high EA is associated to the high concentration
of low coordinated and positively charged gold atoms in a nonplanar
configuration. This leads to the conclusion that the chemical reactivity
of gold nanoclusters can be modified with specific ligand decorations,
enforcing different cluster geometries and charge distributions. Theoretical
results herein reported demonstrate that the electronic behavior and
the capacity of small gold nanoclusters to absorb or donate electrons
are influenced by the presence of phosphine ligands, their concentration,
and spatial configuration. Therefore, it can be stated that the chemical
activity of gold clusters can be altered thorough specific synthesis
procedures in which the concentration of phosphine ligands is controlled.

Conclusions
DFT calculations were performed over neutral
and charged Au8 clusters with phosphine ligands added at
different concentrations
and configurations. The bare neutral Au8 cluster has planar
geometry with two- and four-folded gold atoms, with slight negative
charges concentrating at two-coordinated atoms located at the outside
corners of the planar cluster. These sites become centers of ligand
binding as the phosphine transfers an unshared pair of electrons to
the electrophilic corners of the cluster. The charge distribution
in the unprotected neutral cluster hints that the binding behavior
between clusters and four PH3 ligands in the outer configuration
is the most stable ligand-protected cluster with the strongest binding
per ligand. The strong binding stability was evidenced by the planar
geometry kept by the Au8(PH3)4-outer cluster and confirmed by analyses of charge, electron density of
molecular orbitals, and electronic DOS. In the cases where clusters
maintained planar geometry, electrons provided by ligands distributed
along the cluster plane located at hollow sites formed by gold atoms,
making the clusters more nucleophilic. The energy degenerance for
very different neutral structures was observed (outer and inner),
but when those ligand-protected clusters were charged, the degenerance
was lost; although in that case, the gold cluster structure remains
very similar to the flat structure of the neutral Au8 cluster.
Ionizing the ligand-protected cluster resulted in oxidation of gold
atoms and destabilization of the planar geometry in the case of highest
concentration of ligands due to the inoccupation of Au–Au bonding
states at the HOMO energy level. Adiabatic IEs and EAs showed that
both variables are higher for charged systems, as expected, and are
consistent with HOMO and LUMO energies, respectively. Furthermore,
it was shown that IE and EA decrease as the concentration of ligands
increases in both charged and neutral clusters. These results provide
the theoretical support to guide experimental strategies to adjust
the electron density behavior of gold-based clusters, and therefore,
their chemical activity.
