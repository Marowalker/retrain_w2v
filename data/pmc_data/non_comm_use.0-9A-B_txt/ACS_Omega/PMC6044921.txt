Wax apple fruit (Syzygium aqueum Alston cv. Taaptimjan) is a tropical
fruit with many nutritional
bioactive compounds and high economic value. However, when fully ripe,
the thin-skinned fruit is highly susceptible to physical damage and
microbial spoilage that significantly reduce its commercial value.
The present study was aimed to find a suitable ripening stage between
the ripe and overripe wax apple fruits for developing a value-added
beverage specifically cider. The chemical profiles of ripe and overripe
wax apple juice and cider were determined by measuring sugar, acid,
alcohol, mineral, proximate, ascorbic acid, amino acid, antioxidant,
and volatile levels. Overall, the results showed significant variations.
The physicochemical and proximate analysis showed highest values for
ripe fruit juice than overripe fruit juice and the cider samples.
The amino acids in the samples were found almost at similar levels.
Polyphenolic content and antioxidant activities were higher in ciders
than in unfermented juices. In addition, the overripe fruit cider
had more volatile compounds than ripe fruit cider and unfermented
juices. Overall, the overripe fruit is suitable for producing cider,
whereas the ripe fruit is more suitable for the unfermented beverages.

Introduction
Fruits and vegetables produced in Thailand
have good reputation
for extraordinary quality and nutritional properties because of the
uniqueness of the tropical conditions. Tropical fruit crops are one
a major component contributing to the Thai economic growth, and the
export value has trended upward in the recent decades.1 Wax apple is an important fruit grown in all parts of Thailand,
with a high yield of 64 954 tons valued at 2431 million baht
in 2016. Wax apple belongs to the genus of Syzygium in the Myrtaceae family. This fruit has many unique organoleptic
characteristics of being glossy, colorful, tender, juicy, with sweet
low-acidity taste, and with a pleasant aroma of roses. Depending on
the variety, the color of wax apple varies from green to dark red.2 The fruit is widely grown in the tropical region
of Asia, in which Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia are the
major producers. In general, these fruits are pear or bell-shaped,
about 3.4–6 cm long and 4–5 cm wide, and weigh from
70 to 200 g.

These are rich sources of nutrition with water,
carbohydrate, protein,
vitamins, and minerals, along with some medicinal properties such
as antidiabetes, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antihypertensive,
antimicrobial, antituberculosis, and antidiarrheal activities.1,2 However, this fruit is highly perishable because of its thin skin
and can be easily damaged. Furthermore, wax apple has a plentiful
water content in the flesh, inducing cracks, rot, and perishing.3 In addition, it is also sensitive to low temperatures
(0–10 °C) that induce chilling injuries.2 The short shelf life and susceptibility to damage during
transportation limits economic expansion of the wax apple market.
Therefore, novel fruit processing techniques are needed to take full
advantage of the quality and nutritional benefits. There have been
several studies on extending the storage life of fresh fruits. However,
wax apples are not widely considered in terms of processing and new
product development, especially in the field of beverages. Thus, the
processing of both wax apple juice and cider could enhance the value
of the fruit and contribute to international commercialization.

Cider is a fermented low alcoholic beverage made from unfiltered
fruit juice, mostly from apples. The alcohol content in cider depends
on the sugar level of fruit juice and varies from 1 to 12%.4 During fermentation, microorganisms (mainly yeast)
convert sugar to ethanol.4 Yeasts belong
to the class of Saccharomycetes in the fungal phylum Ascomycota. Generally,
the species Saccharomyces, Kloeckera, Candida, and Pichia are widely used in cider
fermentation. High tolerance of acidity enables the yeast to survive
and grow in fruit juices. It also has a significant role in the creation
of the aroma profile in cider. The maximal tolerance of ethanol by
yeast during fermentation is about 65% ethanol yield or 53 g/L ethanol,
and after that, the yeast cell growth and the ethanol production slow
down gradually.5 The efficiency and rate
of fermentation are influenced by several factors, such as sugar content,
temperature, storage time, and pH. One key factor for the cider making
industry is the choice of fruits, and traditionally apples are widely
used because of natural flavor, level of sugars, water content, and
richness in phytochemicals.6 Besides apples,
there are many other fruits such as pear, currants, gooseberries,
mulberries, elderberries, cherries, oranges, dates, pineapples, raspberries,
and strawberries, which are likewise applicable to making ciders.4 However, no prior study has attempted to produce
cider from the wax apple.

Fruit ripening is an irreversible
developmental process that involves
specific biochemical and physiological attributes. Wax apple is a
non-climacteric fruit, which produces low ethylene and has a low respiration
rate during ripening.7 Because it follows
a non-climacteric pattern, the fruit will not further develop off
the tree and will not respond to ethylene for ripening. Therefore,
the development of wax apples until the harvest plays a crucial role
in the fruit characteristics, such as color development, acid and
sugar contents, and phytochemicals. To establish a high-quality standard
of cider beverage, it is important to evaluate the impact of the fruit
variety at different ripening stages on the various important compounds.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the
ripening stage has an effect on the juice and cider quality, and to
generate new information about the physicochemical profiles of wax
apple juices and ciders, when the apples are used at different stages
of maturation. Parameters were quantified in samples including chemical
profile (sugars, acids, alcohols, proximate, ascorbic acid), minerals,
amino acid profile, phytochemicals, antioxidants, and flavor.

Results
and Discussion
The physical qualities of ripe and overripe
wax apple juices and
their ciders are presented in Table 1. The color characteristics lightness (L), chroma (C*)
and hue (H°) varied significantly among the samples. Ripe fruit
juice exhibited higher L values than the other samples. Furthermore,
fermentation slightly decreased the L values of wax apple juice to
lower values for the cider samples. On the other hand, the C* was
slightly higher for the overripe fruit juice than for the other samples.
The ripe and overripe cider samples had higher H° than the unfermented
juices. Overall, the cider samples were significantly different in
color from the fresh juices. The fresh wax apple juices displayed
a pinkish red color, whereas the ciders were yellowish. Sikri8 reported that increased H° could indicate
increased yellowness of food. The changes in color could be from degradation
of anthocyanins during fermentation. Nie et al.9 observed decreased anthocyanin in fermented blueberry juice,
and it was due to interactions of anthocyanin and polyphenol oxidase
during the fermentation. The ripe fruit juice had slightly higher
viscosity than the other samples; the overripe fruit juice and the
cider samples did not significantly differ. The density was slightly
higher for the overripe fruit juice and the cider samples, however
without significant difference (P > 0.05). Furthermore,
the electrical conductivities of fresh juices were lower than those
of the cider samples (P < 0.05).

The sugar, acid, and alcohol contents in ripe and overripe wax
apple juices and their ciders are shown in Table 1. The fermentable sugars sucrose, d-glucose, and d-fructose were significantly higher in the
overripe fruit juice than in the ripe juice. On the other hand, the
cider samples had no detectable sugars after fermentation, suggesting
that all sugar was converted to alcohol by yeast. In accordance with
the sugar results, the total soluble solid (TSS) level was strongly
decreased to below 3.2 °Bx in the cider samples, while before
fermentation, it was between 10.5 and 10.8 °Bx in the fresh juices.
Generally, titratable acidity (TA) relates to the buffering capacity
that maintains pH during the fermentation, which could add and/or
remove acid or alkali in the cider. TA was slightly decreased in the
cider samples compared to fresh juice, possibly consumed to maintain
the pH. pH of the fresh samples (4.29–4.39) was a bit lower
than of the cider samples (4.62–4.63). Volatile acidity (VA)
was plentiful in the cider samples relative to fresh wax apple juices.
Overripe cider and juice samples had slightly elevated VA. Among alcohols,
mainly ethanol and methanol were identified in the cider samples:
ethanol was predominant while methanol contents were small (0.08–0.12%).
A minute level of fermentation had occurred in the unfermented fruit
juices, as evidenced by the presence of ethanol (see Table 1). This could be due to fermentation
by natural yeasts on the fruit surfaces.

The proximate compositions
of ripe and overripe wax apple juice
and their cider are shown in Table 1. Moisture was the dominant component in all proximate
compositions. Ripe and overripe wax apple juices did not differ in
moisture content (P > 0.05), but the ciders had
slightly
increased moisture. Normally, anaerobic fermentation does not influence
the moisture content of a beverage. Ananias et al.10 reported increased moisture levels in the fermented beverages,
which might be from the conversion of alcohol into acetic acid and
water in the presence of oxygen during handling. The carbohydrates
were higher in the fruit juices than in the ciders. Ash content was
stable and did not differ among the samples (P >
0.05). In addition, the results showed less protein in the ciders
than in the juices. The decreased protein in cider could be due to
many reasons, it could be metabolized by yeast to form amino acids
or fatty acids11 and/or changed pH during
fermentation could degrade the protein.12 On the other hand, the fat content was elevated in the cider samples.
Fat could be accumulated from dead yeast cell membranes. Phospholipids
are the key factor strengthening yeast cells and increasing the ethanol
level during fermentation, adversely changing the proportion of phospholipids
and ergosterol in the cell membrane and thereby making an unsuitable
environment for yeast to survive.5,13 The fresh
fruit juices had higher caloric contents than the cider samples. Ascorbic
acid was slightly decreased in the cider samples relative to the unfermented
juices. Ascorbic acid is highly susceptible to chemical and enzymatic
oxidation during processing. Escudero-López et al.14 observed a slight decrease in ascorbic acid
in fermented orange juice. Among the different minerals, calcium,
magnesium, and potassium were predominant. The overripe fruit ciders
had higher levels of calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, copper,
and zinc than the other samples. Overripe juice and cider tended to
have more vitamins and minerals than the ripe samples. Overall, the
proximate compositions significantly differed between the wax apple
juices and their ciders. However, the ripe and overripe cases did
not differ significantly.

The amino acid profiles of ripe and
overripe wax apple juices and
their ciders are presented in Table 2. In the present study, a total of 23 amino acids were
found in the wax apple samples, while cystine, hydroxylysine, asparagine,
and cysteine were not detectable. The results significantly differed
between the juices and the ciders. Most amino acids in the juice decreased
with ripeness. However, the amino acids methionine, phenylalanine,
serine, threonine, and glutamine were reasonably elevated in the overripe
wax apple juice. Generally, amino acids are the building blocks of
proteins and can be converted through various biochemical pathways
to glucose, fatty acids, purines, and pyrimidines during maturation.15 On the other hand, the unfermented juice samples,
especially the ripe juice, exhibited higher levels of amino acids
than the other samples. The overripe wax apple cider had abundant
levels of proline, serine, threonine, and glutamine. In addition,
the amino acids methionine and isoleucine were found incomparable
among each other during this study. The unfermented juice samples
contained tryptophan that was not detected in the cider samples. Fermentation
decreased the amino acids levels because of the assimilation of amino
acids by Saccharomyces sp. and conversion
to fusel acids and fusel alcohols via the Ehrlich pathway, as well
as conversion to proteins via protein synthesis.16,17 These could be the key reasons for lack of and/or decrease in amino
acids in the fermented cider samples. Burroughs18 mentioned in a comparative study of amino acids in apple
juice and cider that the increased level of amino acids in cider samples
could be the result of yeast autolytic processes.

The polyphenolic compounds
and antioxidant efficiencies of ripe
and overripe wax apple juices and their ciders are presented in Table 3. There were a total
of 9 phenolic compounds identified in the samples, namely, gallic
acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric
acid, hydroxycinnamic acid, ferulic acid, vanillic acid, cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside.
Among these, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and gallic
acid were predominant in all the samples. The majority of phenolics
was observed at higher levels in the cider samples than in the unfermented
juices, except for the anthocyanins cyanidins. The levels of phenolic
compounds varied with the ripeness of wax apple fruits, as did in
the individual phenolic types. Several studies have reported augmentation
of phenolic content in fermented fruit beverages.19,20 On the other hand, decreased cyanidins in cider could be due to
the metabolic activity of yeast.21 In another
study, Gomez et al.22 and Zhao and Dixon23 reported that in the presence of ATP, cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-o-glucoside
could move into the yeast vesicles and into the yeast cell and become
unavailable. This could be the reason for unfermented pinkish red
wax apple juice changing yellowish after fermentation. The flavonoid
contents of catechin, quercetin, kaempferol, and rutin were higher
in overripe juice and ciders. Khandaker et al.24 reported that alcoholic solvent was more effective in extracting
the fruit phytochemicals than other organic solvents. The alcohol
from fermentation could separate the nonpolymerized phenolics from
the juice. Overall, the total phenolic contents of the overripe juice
and its cider were higher than in ripe juice or ripe juice cider.
Likewise, the antioxidant activities were highly correlated with the
polyphenolic results; the overripe cider retained higher reducing
power than the other samples. In addition, the radical scavenging
ability of cider, especially the overripe cider, was significantly
higher than in other cases. Budak et al.25 also reported high antioxidant activities in apple ciders compared
to unfermented apple juice. The results showed that wax apple juice
and its cider were more efficient in scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) radicals and hydroxyl radicals than ABTS+ radicals.
Khandaker et al.24 have found that red
wax apple fruit exhibits high DPPH scavenging activity. Fakruddin
et al.26 observed similar antioxidant efficiencies,
particularly in DPPH radical scavenging, reducing power potentiality,
and hydroxyl radical scavenging, in yeast that extracted from fruit
as compared to standard ascorbic acid. This could also be one of the
reasons for slightly higher antioxidant activities in wax apple ciders.

The flavor profiles of ripe
and overripe wax apple juices and their
ciders are presented in Table 4. A total of 57 flavor compounds in 10 categories, namely,
alcohols (18), acids (12), esters (8), terpenes (6), aldehydes (3),
amines (2), and other compounds (8), were observed in the juices and
ciders. The overripe fruit cider (37 compounds) showed more volatile
compounds than the other samples: ripe fruit cider (35 compounds),
ripe fruit juice (29 compounds), and overripe fruit juice (26 compounds).
The results revealed that fermentation helps develop more flavor compounds
in the wax apple juice. The unfermented ripe fruit juice exhibited
more flavor compounds compared to overripe fruit juice. On the other
hand, the overripe fruit cider showed more volatile compounds than
the ripe juice cider. Overall, the different ciders and juices varied
significantly. Yeast plays a vital role in developing various flavor
compounds through its metabolic activity. Among the various flavor
compounds alcohols, esters and their acetates, acids, and fatty acids
are important flavor contributors in alcoholic beverages.27 Normally, alcohol is a byproduct of yeast performing
anaerobic fermentation of sugar in a fruit juice. It has an intense
and pungent odor that contributes significantly to the various flavor
compounds. The alcohol flavor in cider is normally categorized as
“higher alcohol,” and it is also a precursor for synthesizing
esters in the cider. The present study showed that the wax apple ciders
had abundant levels of alcoholic flavor compounds. Among the various
alcohols, hexanal and 3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)- were predominant
in the juices, while 1-butanol, 3-methyl- and 4-hexen-1-ol, (E)- were predominant in the ciders. Overall, 7 alcoholic
compounds were identified in the juice samples, and 10 compounds were
observed in the cider samples. Bicyclo [3.1.0] hex-2-ene, 2-methyl-5-(1-methyl
ethyl)- and 1-hexanol, 2-ethyl- were identified in the juice and cider
samples.

Many studies have reported
ester compounds as the major contributors
of sweet and fruity odor in cider, and these are mainly formed through
esterification of alcohols with fatty acids throughout the fermentation
and post-fermentation stages (Peng, Li, Cui, & Guo, 2015). Some
esters, particularly 3-hexen-1-ol, acetate, (Z)-,
acetic acid, 2-phenylethyl ester, 7-hydroxy heptane-1 and 1-butanol,
3-methyl-, acetate were observed in both juices and ciders. Qiao et
al.28 found various natural fruity flavor
ester compounds in unfermented orange juice. Qin et al.29 reported that fresh apple juice had esters before
it was fermented. The overripe fruit cider contained a higher level
of ester compounds than the ripe fruit cider. This could be due to
the higher concentration of alcohol in the overripe samples (see Table 1). Carboxylic acids
are abundant volatile compounds in ciders, and furthermore, fatty
acids are responsible for the cider’s fruity, cheesy, and rancid
notes.30 The present results show that
the more acidic flavor compounds were present in the ciders than in
the juices. Qin et al.29 reported that
acids normally show a high odor detection threshold, but they did
not affect much cider flavor. There are four fatty acids, namely,
ethyl octonate, ethyl decanoate, octanoic acid, and decanoic acid
observed in the cider samples, and octanoic acid was also found in
the ripe juice samples. On the other hand, acetic acid was observed
at a lower concentration in both juice and cider samples, and the
overripe juice cider had a higher concentration of it (1.57%). Acetic
acid is responsible for vinegar flavor in the cider samples, and it
is synthesized by the oxidation of acetaldehyde by alcoholic or malolactic
fermentation.

Terpenes are pungent oils contributing fruity
odor, and in the
present study, they were only found in the ripe and overripe juice
samples, not in the ciders. Zhang et al.31 reported that terpenes were generated in red wine through esterification. P-Cymene, caryophyllene, α-humulene, 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-3-cyclohexen-1-ol,
and Δ-cadinene were identified in wax apple ripe and overripe
samples. Caryophyllene was predominant among the others, and the overripe
juice had a higher level of terpenes than the ripe juice. Aldehydes
such as pentanal, 2,4-hexadienal, and benzaldehyde were identified
only in the fruit juice samples, and the overripe fruit juice had
slightly more aldehydes. Ye et al.30 reported
that a lower concentration of aldehydes could provide a pleasant fruity
flavor. On the other hand, amines (methanamine and 3-methoxy benzamine)
were only observed in the cider samples. The overripe fruit cider
had more amines than the ripe fruit cider. Garai et al.32 stated that biogenic amines are closely related
to ripening and fermentation and are normally generated into fermented
beverages by microbial decarboxylation of amino acids. The other compounds
observed were two ethers (propane, 1-methoxy- and 2-propanol, 1-chloro),
two cycloalkanes [(1R)-2,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-ene
and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-ene, 2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-], two fluorocarbons
(furan, 2-ethyl- and ethene, fluoro), and two phenols (oxime-, methoxy-phenyl-).
Among the various other compounds, 2-propanol, 1-chloro- was dominant
and was found in the overripe fruit cider. Overall, the cider made
of overripe wax apple fruit juice had more numerous volatile compounds
than the other samples.

Conclusions
The present study had
provided information regarding the impacts
of the ripening stage on the chemical profiles of juices and ciders
made of the wax apple fruit. The results revealed that over ripeness
of the fruit influenced the physicochemical properties, phytochemicals,
and flavor compounds widely. Fruit juice and its cider did not differ
much in terms of synthesis and/or degradation of bioactive chemical
compounds. A slight decrease in amino acids was observed in the cider
samples from their level in juice, but the changes were smallish.
As compared to ripe fruits, overripe fruits are possibly suitable
for producing fermented beverages, as they have abundant vitamins
and antioxidants. The cider produced from overripe wax apple fruit
juice contains more than 6% of ethanol, and it is considered to be
a hard cider. The fruit at the overripe stage normally has a low economic
value because of its short shelf life; therefore, producing value-added
products such as cider could improve the competitiveness of this unique
seasonal fruit.

Experimental Section
Raw Material Preparation
The ripe and overripe wax
apples (Syzygium aqueum Alston cv.
Taaptimjan) were hand-picked from a commercial orchard in Surat Thani
province of southern Thailand. The collected samples were screened
for uniform size [height (7–9 cm) and width (6–8 cm
in diameter)], color (dark red), total soluble solids (10–14
°Bx), and for being free of defects (apparent damage or disease).
The procured fruit was taken to the laboratory within 8 h and then
sorted into two groups (ripe and overripe). Wax apples were cleaned
of dust with tap water and then washed again with distilled water.
After that, the fruit was thoroughly juiced using a food processor
(Philips centrifugal juicer) in a cold environment (4–7 °C),
then roughly strained with cheese close, and a part of the juice extracts
was stored at −18 °C for further analysis while the remaining
juice was used for cider preparation.

Cider Preparation
The cider fermentation process was
carried out based on the method of Alberti et al.16 with some modifications. The wax apple juice extract (6
L) from each group was fermented in a fermenter. Prior to fermentation,
the wax apple juice was thawed to the ambient temperature before yeast
inoculation. The cider yeast strain, Saccharomyces
bayanus (specific for cider and wine fermentation
and obtained from FERMENTIS, France), was inoculated (106 cells/mL) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Alcoholic
fermentation took place in an anaerobic environment at 25 °C
for 10 days (the duration was set based on a preliminary study). After
the fermentation, the cider was racked, bottled, and frozen (−18
°C) until further analyses.

Physicochemical Analysis
The color of the juice and
cider was measured using a Hunter Lab Ultra Scan colorimeter (Hunter
Associates Laboratory, Inc. Reston, VA, USA). The color coordinates L, a, and b were recorded
and further converted to chroma (C*) and hue (H°) angle. The
kinetic viscosity was obtained using a Brookfield viscometer (Model
LVDV-II+, Brookfield Engineering Laboratory, Inc., Middleboro, USA)
and is reported as apparent viscosity (cP). The density of samples
was measured using a hydrometer based on the buoyant force acting
on a tared body floating in the liquid. The results are expressed
in g/cm3. The electrical conductivity of the sample was
monitored using a conductivity meter, giving the result in mS/cm2 (YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). For chromatographic
analysis of sugar and ethanol,33 the samples
were diluted to 1:10 (mL/mL) with ultrapure water and then filtered
through a membrane prior to analysis. The injection volume was set
to 10 μL, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min in isocratic conditions
with ultrapure water (Milli-Q). The column used was a Waters Sugar
Pak 1 (300 × 6.5 mm), and identification of components was done
by comparing to the retention times of reference standards. For quantification,
calibration curves were made for sucrose, d-glucose, d-fructose, ethanol, and methanol. For TSSs, a sample of a few
drops was analyzed using a digital handheld refractometer (Atago,
Tokyo, Japan), and the results are expressed in °Bx. For determination
of acids and VA, the TA was determined by volumetric neutralization
with sodium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein as the indicator. The
TA is expressed in equivalent tartaric acid (g/L). VA was measured
based on the method proposed by Kourkoutas et al.34 The results are expressed as equivalent acetic acid (g/L).
The pH of wax apple juice and cider samples was measured using a digital
pH meter (pH30 Tester, CLEAN, Shanghai, China).

Proximate Analysis
Wax apple juice and cider were subjected
to proximate analysis. The analysis included protein, carbohydrate,
fat, ash, moisture, vitamins, and minerals. The Soxhlet method was
used for fat content, and the moisture content was measured using
a moisture analyzer. The Kjeldahl method according to AOAC35 was used for protein determination. For ash
content, the sample was first dried in an oven at 100 °C before
being transferred to a muffle furnace at 550 °C until a white
or light gray ash remained. Ascorbic acid content in the juice and
cider samples was quantified using a modified high-pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) assay suggested by Lee and Coates.36 The minerals iron, copper, zinc, calcium, sodium,
potassium, and magnesium were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry
with a flame emission spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer 460).

Amino
Acid Profile
The identification of amino acids
in juice and cider samples was done by the chromatographic method
developed by Alberti et al.16 The identification
and quantification were accomplished by HPLC according to the AccQ
Tag reagent kit methodology with a Pico-Tag column (4 mm, 3.9 ×
150 mm). Twenty-three amino acids were quantified in the sample and
are reported in mg/100 mL.

Polyphenolic Compounds and Antioxidants
The extraction
and identification of phenolics (by HPLC) in the samples were conducted
using the method described by Alberti et al.19 The retention times and spectra of the selected phenolic standards
were used to identify the phenolic compounds in the samples by using
calibration curves of standards. The phenolic compounds, mainly gallic
acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, hydroxyl cinnamic acid, ferulic
acid, vanillic acid, cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, and
cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside; and the flavonols such as
catechin, quercetin, kaempferol, and rutin, were identified and quantified,
and the results are expressed in μg/mL. The total phenolic and
total flavonoid contents were also calculated based on the method
of Alberti et al.16 The DPPH scavenging
activity was determined as described by Alberti et al.16 The results are expressed as percentages. The
ABTS+ radical cation scavenging activity of the samples
was determined using the method suggested by Campodonico et al.37 The results are expressed as percentages. The
method suggested by Alberti et al.16 was
applied for identifying the ferric reducing ability of the samples.
The results are expressed as percentages. The hydroxyl radical (OH•) scavenging ability of the samples was measured by
the deoxyribose method described by Halliwell et al.38 The results are expressed as percentages.

Chromatographic
Analysis of Volatile Compounds
The
analysis was performed by mixing 6 mL of a sample with 50 μL
of the internal standard (heptanoic acid) in a 20 mL glass vial. Prior
to analysis, the samples were incubated for 10 min at 60 °C under
agitation in the oven of the automatic injector. After that, the volatile
compounds were identified using the static headspace method proposed
by Pietrowski et al.39

Statistical
Analysis
The fermentation of wax apple
juice extracts was performed in six replications. The data are presented
as mean and SEM (n = 6). Pearson correlations (r) of the observed variables were assessed. Two-way ANOVA
was performed to study the interactions between the evaluated variables
of the juice and cider. All the statistical analyses were run in SPSS
v6 for Windows (IBM, NY, USA).
