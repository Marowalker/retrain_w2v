This
investigation explores optimum synthetic conditions for novel
polymer-metal organic framework hybrid composites composed of Zr-terephthalate-based
MOF UiO-66 and conductive polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers in an effort
to optimize conductivity while minimizing MOF structural deformation.
Successful syntheses of self-assembled PANI nanofibers in PANI@UiO-66
and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites were confirmed using scanning
electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction.
The polymer-MOF composites show different bonding synergies to the
PANI nanofibers depending on the organic linker used. Electronic properties
of the post-synthetically modified PANI@UiO-66 and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 were investigated using UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy. Sheet resistivity of the self-assembled polymer-MOF
composites was determined under an inert atmosphere at room temperature
using four-point probe measurements to confirm tunable semiconductivity
ranging from 40 to 2 mS/sq. Furthermore, the effects of aniline oxidation
on the crystallinity and coordination of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 were determined through analysis of these results.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly versatile
materials studied for numerous applications including gas adsorption,1,2 drug delivery,3 and catalysis4,5 among others. MOFs feature inorganic metal ion nodes linked together
through easily tailored organic ligands, which provide a high degree
of tunability and large specific surface areas. These traits are also
useful for designing thin-film electrode materials for capacitors
or electrocatalytic electrodes; however, there has been little research
on MOFs in electronic-based applications because of limited charge
transport capabilities. Isolation of the inorganic nodes and the inability
of constrained phenyl linkers to π stack limits the desirable
delocalized charge carrier capabilities found in their pure metal
oxide counterparts.6,7 Although, there are examples of
MOFs reported in literature that show conducting and semiconducting
behaviors utilizing 2-dimensional stacking structures.8,9 There have also been examples of highly porous conductive MOFs created
through guest molecule loading, which act as mediators to achieve
a Schottky junction between metal clusters.10 In the former case, these highly desirable structures come at the
cost of long term environmental and chemical stabilities, and in the
latter case, the reagent materials used are often quite expensive
limiting their practicality. Ideally, a semiconducting MOF material
would be chemically robust and affordable, which would be attractive
for use in several electronic-based applications including dye-sensitized
solar cells, electrocatalytic cells, and electrochemical sensing amongst
others.

Interestingly, MOFs composed of tetravalent group IV
metal ions
and carboxylate ligands possess some of the strongest coordination
bonds reported in literature, significantly increasing research interests
in these materials over the last ten years.11−13 More specifically,
zirconium MOFs using the octahedral [Zr6O4(OH)4]12+ secondary building unit (SBU) coordinated
with linear ligands possess additional degrees of tunability without
the loss of crystallinity and superb chemical robustness.14,15 The most basic motif utilizes terephthalic acid (TPA) ligands as
linkers, known as UiO-66, and has shown unprecedented thermal stability.
UiO-66 has proved stable in most polar solvents and acidic conditions,
and it has thermal stability reported up to 500 °C.14,15 Regarding catalytic and photocatalytic systems, modified UiO-66
MOFs have shown potential as molecular photocatalysts for a variety
of reactions including water splitting.5,16,17 Simple pre- and postsynthetic modifications to the
TPA ligands can extend the optical bandgap of the MOF considerably.
For example, an amine functionality introduced presynthetically into
the TPA ligand extends the bandgap of UiO-66 by more than 1 eV.18,19 Unfortunately, due to the localization of charge carriers, Zr-based
MOFs have not been attractive solutions for use in electrochemical
and photoelectrochemical cells.

The introduction of a novel
conducting mediator could be used to
impart true semiconducting behavior unto Zr-based MOFs. This work
therefore seeks to provide UiO-66 and conjugate UiO-66-NH2 with a stable, low-cost mode of electron transport directly through
the in situ synthesis of a conductive organic polymer functionalized
onto the MOF. Polyaniline (PANI) was chosen as a mediator for its
favorable electrostatic interactions between the organic terephthalic
linker (TPA) and the aniline precursor. Furthermore, PANI is an extensively
studied conductive organic polymer due to its simple and tunable synthesis
and high environmental stability.20,21 It has been
shown to possess relatively high conducting capability in its emeraldine
salt state from a combination of an extended π network and plasmonic
effects caused by radical cation amines coupled to anions.22 PANI typically forms thin nanofibrous films
through π stacking of aniline subunits upon evaporation of solvent.
These nanofibers were perceived to bridge Zr-based MOF particles creating
a cohesive polymer-MOF hybrid composite network.25 This ensures a simple, scalable film preparation that could
be used as a novel electrode material.

Polymer-MOF hybrids have
only recently appeared in literature and
are thought to combine the highly attractive features of both materials
for applications in enhancing the surface area and control of polymer
chain functionality. Wang et al. demonstrated the specific PANI-UiO-66
electrostatic relationship on a nanoscopic scale for applications
in photothermal treatment.26 Their finding
also showed increased chemical stability of the polymer in the composite
material. A separate report from this group highlighted its potential
as an electrochemical sensor and supercapacitor.35,36,40 An even more recent work discusses the possible
use of a polymer-MOF material as supports in photocatalytic systems,
but to our knowledge, no work has been done that investigates the
effects of oxidative stress and high PANI concentration on structural
integrity and conductive capability.39 The
PANI@UiO-66 composites used in this study not only exhibit higher
relative PANI concentrations and self-assembled films compared to
the above sources but also feature direct comparison of TPA ligands
that contain different functionalities. In the case of the conjugate
UiO-66-NH2, an amine moiety on the TPA linker was chosen
to impart the MOF with a synthetic route for covalently cross-linking
with PANI. In addition to the clear similarity in structures of aniline
and the 2-aminoterephthalate (ATPA), the derivative UiO-66-NH2 has been shown to readily undergo postsynthetic modification
to form new bonds.23,24 The covalency with amine surface
sites at relatively high-concentration ratios was perceived to provide
PANI@UiO-66-NH2 films with enhanced bulk polymer stability.
This work demonstrates the bulk interaction in the PANI@UiO-66 and
PANI@UiO-66-NH2 comparing thermal and chemical stabilities
and conductivity effects relative to the concentration of oxidant
and aniline used. The implications of this work provide a simple synthetic
pathway to induce tunable, low cost conductivity via PANI@MOF polymer
hybrid films as well as investigate the effects of conventional polymer
reaction conditions on the MOF structure.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
Zirconium (IV) chloride,
purchased ACRO Chemistry (AR purity 97%), terephthalic acid, and 2-aminoterephthalic
acid purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (AR purity <99%) were used as
precursors for UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), purchased from Fisher
Scientific (AR purity <99%), was used as a complexing solvent.
Ammonia peroxydisulfate (APS), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (AR purity
<98%) and aniline, purchased from Fisher Scientific (AR purity
<99%), were used as precursors for PANI synthesis. All chemicals
are analytical grades and were used without any further purification.

2.2 UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 Syntheses
UiO-66 synthesis was completed as a one-pot synthesis in Teflon-lined
reaction vessel based on a solvothermal synthesis reported by Shearer
et al.27 Zirconium (IV) chloride (1.98
mmol) and terephthalic acid (1.98 mmol) precursors were dissolved
in 34 mL of DMF. An addition of 340 μL of concentrated hydrochloric
acid moderator was then added to improve ligand solvent exchange.
The solution was placed in a 120 °C oven and heated for 24 h.
The resulting precipitate was washed three times with DMF, and once
with methanol, before being collected by vacuum filtration. This process
was repeated substituting 2-aminoterephthalic acid for terephthalic
acid to create UiO-66-NH2.

2.3 PANI
Synthesis
PANI synthesis was
adapted from a one-pot synthetic procedure reported by Li et al.25 An ammonium peroxydisulfate precursor solution
was created by dissolving APS (0.799 mmol) in 10 mL of 1 M hydrochloric
acid. Aniline (306 mmol) was dissolved in a separate vial containing
10 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid. The APS precursor solution was then
rapidly added to the aniline precursor solution. The vial was shaken
for approximately 30 s and then left undisturbed to polymerize for
24 h at room temperature. PANI was then centrifuged and washed three
times with 1 M HCl to remove excess APS.29

2.4 PANI@UiO-66 Composite Synthesis
Two
separate aniline and APS stock solutions were prepared according to
the PANI synthesis. UiO-66 (or UiO-66-NH2) was then added
to three empty vials (0.03 g in each). Aniline stock solution was
diluted in accordance with the desired mass ratios of aniline monomer
to MOF (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). Briefly, the three vials containing MOF
were prepped by adding 0.974, 1.947, and 2.921 mL of the aniline stock
solution. Equivalent volumes of APS stock solution were added to a
separate set of vials. All solutions were diluted with 1 M HCl to
4 mL each and sonicated for 30 min to suspend the MOF uniformly in
solution. An additional control trial exposed the fully concentrated
APS stock solution to MOF to confirm retention of the framework. From
this point, the standard PANI synthesis was followed via the rapid
addition of APS solutions to the corresponding aniline@MOF slurries.
After full polymerization and washing, the composite slurries were
drop casted on glass slides and formed polymer-MOF hybrid films through
evaporation-assisted self-assembly of PANI nanofibers.

3 Instrumentation
Functional groups of the PANI@MOF composites
were identified using
Fourier transform infrared attenuated total resonance (FT-IR-ATR)
spectroscopy on a CARY 630 FT-IR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) data of the MOFs and PANI@MOF composites were collected on
a Rigaku Miniflex 600 benchtop diffractometer using a Cu anode with
Kα1 = 1.5406(5) Å and Kα2 = 1.5444(5) Å fitted
with a Ni Kβ filter. Samples were analyzed between 2θ
= 5–80° with a step size of 0.01 degrees and a scan speed
of 0.2 degrees/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out
using a TA Instruments Q600 SDT simultaneous DSCTGA on a powder sample
of MOF and PANI@MOF composites. All samples were heated in air at
a ramp rate of 25 °C/min to 1000 °C and then held isothermally
at 1000 °C before ramping back down to 200 °C at 25 °C/min.
A Micrometrics GEMINI 2360 was used to measure the BET surface areas
of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 using N2 at 77 K. Subsequently,
BET surface area isotherms of PANI@MOF composites were collected on
an Anton Paar NOVA touch. All samples were degassed at 200 °C
for 3 h, and surface areas were measured using the BET equation and
criteria proposed by Roquerol et al.42,43 Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) with complimentary energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) measurements were collected on a JEOL JSM-6480LV SEM and JEOL
JCM-7000 SEM. The pristine UiO-66 3:1 and 2:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2 samples imaged were precoated using 5 nm Au nanoparticles to reduce
charging, and the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 was precoated with carbon.

Conductivity of each composite material was found using the four-point
probe method, on an S-302 resistivity stand reading sheet resistivity
in ohms/square in an inert N2 atmosphere at room temperature.
Eleven trials were performed on each film to achieve a statistical
range of the reciprocal resistivity (sheet conductivity) for each
composite. The optical electronic structure was characterized using
a Persee T8DS UV/vis spectrophotometer with the IS19-1 integrating
sphere attachment.

4 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
FT-IR spectra of different PANI@UiO-66 and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composite powders. Prevalent features of the MOF spectra (black)
include strong symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands from the
TPA carboxylate groups at 1390 and 1584 cm–1 for
UiO-66 and 1379 and 1565 cm–1 for UiO-66-NH2. Additional peaks at 1505 cm–1 (UiO-66)
and 1491 cm–1 (UiO-66-NH2) are the result
of aromatic C–C ring stretching, and the lower frequency peaks
at 667 cm–1 (UiO-66) and 656 cm–1 (UiO-66-NH2) arise from the Zr-μ-Zr stretching
inside the node. There are also additional peaks due to trapped DMF
solvent at 1662 cm–1 (UiO-66) and 1654 cm–1 (UiO-66-NH2). Peaks arising singularly from UiO-66-NH2 include the C–N aromatic amine stretch at 1252 cm–1 and N–H stretching at 3317 and 3444 cm–1.

Figure 1 FT-IR of PANI@UiO-66 composites (A) and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites (B).

The IR spectrum of PANI
(blue) includes characteristic N–H
bending at 1468 and 1438 cm–1 and C–H bending
at 1289 and 1230 cm–1. The broad combination band
coming from 1700 to 1650 cm–1 includes C–C
ring and N–H stretches, as well as secondary N–H deformation.
Combination bands before 1110 cm–1 include aromatic
ring stretching and C–N deformation stretching.

Low doping
1:1 spectra (yellow) shows retention of all major MOF
peaks at intensities comparable to the unfunctionalized MOFs; however,
noticeable peaks at 1133 cm–1 (PANI@UiO-66) and
1140 cm–1 (PANI@UiO-66-NH2) are present
that do not appear in the IR spectrum of the MOFs, which can be attributed
to aromatic ring stretching from the PANI functionalization. Additionally,
there are shoulders on the symmetric and asymmetric COO stretching
peaks arising from C–H and N–H bending in PANI. The
loss of the trapped DMF solvent band at 1655 cm–1 is observed in the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composite, indicating
activation of the MOF due to adsorption of aniline. This indirectly
implies diffusion of aniline into MOF pores during synthesis. Additionally,
hypsochromic shifting of the COO symmetric stretching peak and complimentary
bathochromic shifting of the COO asymmetric peak are observed in the
PANI@UiO-66 composite. These peaks are characteristics of noncovalent
interactions, reducing the strain on Zr–O coordination bonds
as well as a general loss of ligand coordination, which is consistent
with observed PXRD results (see Figure 2). Unfortunately, the broad plasmonic band created
by PANI overshadows N–H stretching frequencies leaving little
detail on oxidation effects on the FG.

Figure 2 XRD of 1:1 and 3:1 PANI@UiO-66
and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites.

IR spectra of higher PANI-doped composites shows overall increases
in PANI stretching frequencies and broadening of spectral bands consistent
with the ratio of aniline used. As expected, the PANI attributed peaks
become more prominent as MOF-related peaks are reduced in intensity
in the PANI@MOF composites. The spectra of PANI@UiO-66 composites
show increasingly larger shifts in the COO symmetric stretching from
1:1 (1394 cm–1) to 2:1 and 3:1 (1416 cm–1), indicating a greater loss of Zr coordination bonding with increasing
PANI concentration. In the case of PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites,
however, retention of Zr−μ–Zr peak and symmetric
O–C–O carboxylate stretching is evident in all the functionalized
spectra supporting higher retention of the MOF motif in solution.
This supports the hypothesis that PANI chain growth is restricted
by the secondary mechanistic pathway provided by the amine functionalization
of the MOF linker. This retention of fixed MOF symmetric carboxylate
stretching is further supported by PXRD results (Figure 2), indicating that the UiO-66-NH2 has much higher resistance to structural collapse in the
strong oxidative environment. This is likely due to the greater decentralization
of electron density provided from the ATPA ligand used in UiO-66-NH2. The lone electron pairs of the aliphatic amine groups provide
a sterically more favorable site for oxidation than the carboxylate
coordination bonds. Thus, this amine group behaves as a terminal site
for oxidative polymerization of PANI ligands while also acting as
a protecting group for the MOF coordination bond.

PXRD data
confirmed that the UiO-66 MOF was successfully synthesized
and that the structure is stable and retains its crystal structure
in both the PANI@UiO-66 and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites.14 As X-ray scattering increases with Z, the diffraction
pattern is dominated by the inorganic portion of the MOF, and it is
not possible to discern information about light atoms; therefore,
only Zr positions can be modelled accurately. The peak positions matched
the reported structure for UiO-6614 with
the 1:1 PANI@UiO-66 showing a high degree of crystallinity. This crystallinity
was largely preserved in the 1:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2 with a
higher background and some peak broadening accompanying the introduction
of the ATPA linker indicating a stronger interaction with the amorphous
PANI. The UiO-66 peaks are still distinguishable in samples with higher
PANI (3:1 pictured) concentration but show significant background
and broadening, with the lower intensity peaks lost in the increased
noise from the higher proportion of the amorphous material in these
composites. This is especially true for the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 composite
in which fewer of the weaker UiO-66 MOF peaks are discernible yet
shows a marked increase in intensity for the peak at 2θ = 17.83(1)°,
accompanied by additional peaks at 2θ = 28.50(2)° and 30.3(3)°,
which are not observed in the 3:1 composite of UiO-66-NH2. These three peaks may indicate some degradation of
the UiO-66 MOF to another Zr-containing phase such as the baddeleyite
polymorph of ZrO2 (PDF card 01-083-0944, CSD ICSD 80050).
Both UiO-66 and baddeleyite phases have a peak around 2θ ≈
18°, so the relatively high intensity of the peak in this region
may indicate it is a composite arising from both phases. This breakdown
of MOF is furthermore evidenced by the extreme drop in the surface
area and thermal stability of the material in the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66
composite.

Refinement of the lattice parameters using the Rietveld
method
showed a slight expansion in the lattice parameter with introduction
of the ATPA linker as shown in Table 1. The 3:1 PANI@UiO-66, however, does not show this
increase in the lattice constant upon increasing PANI concentration.
This expansion in the lattice parameter is likely due to greater synergy
between the PANI polymer and organic linker of UiO-66-NH2. The PANI polymer is capable of covalent linkage to the linker of
UiO-66-NH2 through the −NH2 group of
ATPA, whereas the UiO-66 MOF likely interacts with the PANI polymer
through noncovalent interactions.

Surface
area measurements of pristine UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 fall
well within range reported in literature for these materials
(Table S9) indicating activation of MOF
before PANI functinalization.15,27,28 BET isotherms of composite materials show a decreasing surface area
with an increasing PANI content as expected for composite systems.
The hysteresis loops of each sample (Figure S16) also reflect the composite nature of the PANI-functionalized MOFs.44 Interestingly, the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites retain higher surface areas than the PANI@UiO-66 materials,
with 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 exhibiting a near complete loss of all nanoporosity
(Table 2). This correlates
well with FT-IR and PXRD data suggesting lower retentions of the pristine
MOF content in the UiO-66 composites and further supports the higher
chemical stability of UiO-66-NH2 discussed previously.

Table 2 BET Surface Area and Sheet Conductivity
Measurements of PANI@MOF Composites
material	BET SA (m2/g)	wt % MOF	average sheet
conductivity (mS/sq.)	
1:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2	815	68%	0.019	
1:1 PANI@UiO-66	234	19%	0.23	
3:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2	331	26%	0.85	
3:1 PANI@UiO-66	36	3%	3.04	
Furthermore, surface area
analysis can be used as a direct reflection
of the pristine MOF content in composite systems assuming that all
nanoporosity is attributed purely to the MOF in the material, as reflected
by SEM imaging. This method of the estimating pristine MOF content
was demonstrated by Bunge et al. and is based on eq 1 below.41 1  

The relative weight percent (wt %) of pristine MOF (Table 2) in each composite
reflects
the preservation of crystalline MOF in the sample, but it serves more
as a relative estimation than definitive elemental analysis. These
values are likely an underestimation of the true MOF content, as the
SEM-EDS analysis and PXRD analysis suggest that PANI nanofibers can
block MOF pore sights and polymer oxidation leads to degraded MOFs
with lower surface areas in general. Comparison of the relative wt
% of the composites, however, does show that PANI@UiO-66-NH2 better preserves pristine MOF compared to PANI@UiO-66, as evidenced
by the large discrepancy in the surface area between 1:1 and 3:1 PANI-functionalized
MOFs.

Results from TGA (Figure 3) of PANI@UiO-66 and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 show
characteristic
degradation steps for each MOF respectfully beginning with solvent
evaporation from 50 to 100 °C. The amine-functionalized MOF,
UiO-66-NH2 shows a gradual degradation step from 300 to
600 °C, whereas the UiO-66 MOF shows a more pronounced degradation
step at 500–550 °C. This difference is due to inductive
effects caused by the electronegative amine functional group of UiO-66-NH2, which causes the MOF to be less thermally stable than UiO-66.27,28 Beyond 500–600 °C, all MOF crystallinity lost as the
MOF breaks down into tetragonal zirconia.32 The degradation of PANI is observed in three steps reported for
Cl-doped emeraldine salt: solvent evaporation from 50 to 100 °C
followed by protonic acid decomposition from 160 to 275 °C and
finally the breakdown of the polymer chain gradually into small molecules,
such as ammonia and aniline, from 350 to 1000 °C.33,34 All MOFs excluding 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 exhibit this broad degradation
of the polymer up to 1000 °C.

Figure 3 TGA of PANI@UiO-66 and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites for
low doping (1:1) and high doping (3:1) PANI@MOF Composites

In the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 composite, MOF degradation steps are
still
shown, but the partial framework collapse has clearly resulted in
losses of thermal stability. Interestingly, a new degradation step
appears at 310 °C accounting for 35% degradation. This is attributed
to the breakdown of the polymorphous material into base reagents,
aniline, and zirconium chloride. This can be further evidenced by
the TGA of 1:1 PANI@UiO-66, which also has a much smaller inflection
point in this region not observed in any other material. The 3:1 composite
also shows complete degradation at 600 °C indicating the polymorph
formation also results in less thermally robust PANI.

Conversely,
the amine-functionalized composites exhibit all major
steps associated with each material. Interestingly, the 1:1 composite
also features a sharp degradation step from 585 to 675 C, which may
be attributed to the fragments of polymer attached to MOF side chains.
This observed retention of major degradation steps and proposed polymer
breakdown step coincides with the PXRD and FT-IR results, which clearly
demonstrate penetration of PANI into the MOF network and covalent
linkage to UiO-66-NH2 that is not observed for UiO-66.

Samples imaged using SEM were prepped via drop deposition (1 mg/cm2) on atomically flat Mica discs. All composites were conductively
coated with gold or carbon and imaged using backscatter electron detection
to reduce charging and increase resolution. EDS was performed prior
to conductive coatings. Further, images (Figure S9) of pure PANI show a porous nanofiber network (85–900
nm diameter) congruent with the synthesis reported in literature.25 EDS analysis confirms a fully homogeneous PANI
network in all cases with negligible precursor salt contamination.
The UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 MOF maintains a powder form giving
an octahedral morphology and shows substantially larger aggregates
of 400–1000 nm in size (Figures S10 and S11). This is consistent with PXRD data and MOF topologies
reported in the literature.1,37,38

Because the composites are bulk phase, low magnification of
composite
films provides a great deal of information regarding surface morphology
and aniline polymerizations in the presence of the MOF. In all EDS
spectral maps (see the Supporting Information section), the PANI is uniform and the MOF aggregates do not appear
to be isolated but rather spread uniformly throughout. This contrasts
the topology shown in the images, which is likely the result of the
electron beam penetrating into MOF aggregates embedded beneath the
PANI network. Although reasonable for semiquantitative analysis, Zr
peaks from EDS analysis could not be isolated to the visible MOF aggregate
sites in the SEM images.

The composite film in low doping (1:1)
PANI@UiO-66 is fully aggregated,
and the PANI nanofiber network cannot be observed (Figure 4a). This film, thus, is mostly
aggregated UiO-66, which is supported by PXRD results showing peaks
consistent with the pristine MOF. The lack of any surface detail suggests
that the PANI network aggregates between MOF particles. This behavior
was not observed in other papers using polyaniline/MOF composites
that reported a core–shell relationship.26,35,36 Counterintuitively, the 1:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2 shows high retention of single-MOF particles with a visible
PANI network beneath (Figure 4d). The network is too aggregated to show visible branching,
but the core–shell relationship reported is more plausible
in this case, considering composite film morphology has not significantly
changed from pure UiO-66-NH2. This reasoning is supported
by PXRD result showing that increasing the relative amount of PANI
polymer present significantly alters spectral peaks and peak intensity.
However, large amounts of carbon and oxygen can clearly be seen in
greater quantity around large MOF aggregate sites in the EDS spectra,
which could be attributed to greater MOF/PANI cohesion. Additionally,
the EDS spectra also show more PANI being formed in the PANI@UiO-66
composites over the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites, which supports
the notion that polymerization off the NH2 group of the
organic linker inhibits orderly polymer stacking of PANI. In the amine-functionalized
spectra, the MOF ligands participate in oxidative polymerization on
its surface leading to this greater cohesion, which can be visualized
in high doping 2:1 and 3:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2 SEM images (Figure 4e,f).

Figure 4 SEM images of PANI@UIO-66
at PANI/MOF ratios of 1:1 (A), 2:1 (B),
and 3:1 (C), and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 at PANI:MOF ratios of
1:1 (D), 2:1 (E), and 3:1 (F).

SEM images of the high doping UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 composites
show amorphous PANI fibral networks around aggregated MOF crystals.
MOF aggregates are more spaced throughout the material in each image,
but the PANI network appears to be more prevalent in the PANI@UiO-66
composites. This is supported by EDS results showing that more PANI
has formed in the unfunctionalized composites. The MOF crystal structure,
however, appears different in the 2:1 and 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 composites,
adopting larger needle-like crystal forms. This is likely due to some
degradation of the UiO-66 framework to another Zr-containing phase,
which is consistent with the PXRD results of the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 composite.
The PXRD spectrum (Figure 2) shows broadening due to the amorphous PANI network, which
makes it difficult to observe all peaks that could arise from the
UiO-66 MOF; however, there is a strong increase in intensity for the
peak at 2θ = 17.83(1)°, suggesting that a baddeleyite polymorph
of ZrO2 has formed within the composite. This decomposition
is not observed in the SEM images, TGA, or PXRD spectra of the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites. As indicated previously, the amine-functionalized
linker shows greater chemical resistance, which allows the UiO-66-NH2 to retain its structure in the presence of a strong oxidant,
whereas UiO-66 does not.

In the higher magnification image of
the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2 (Figure S8), the PANI nanofibers
are observed more clearly branching out of MOF aggregates. Comparing
this finding with the PXRD results and 1:1 PANI@UiO-66-NH2 image, it can be concluded that PANI nanofibers are covalently linked
to the MOF surface, as the MOF core clearly encompasses a PANI network
over the entire surface (Figure 5).

Figure 5 UV–vis spectra of PANI@UiO-66 composites (left)
and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites (right).

Studies on optoelectronic and conducting properties of all
PANI@MOF
composite materials reveal a great deal of information on how PANI
conduction can be tuned by the synthesis of nanofibers around MOF
architectures. As seen in Figure 5, the PANI network adds a slight photosensitization
to MOF with a 2.5 eV bandgap. In addition, the plasmonic band absorption
due to the PANI network past 530 nm provides unique conducting capabilities
to the material.25,29This is relevant in the design
of conductive composite MOF materials containing Zr-based MOFs, which
are mostly insulating by nature. The UiO-66 MOF, in particular, is
considered quasisemiconducting with a 4.0 eV bandgap (BG); there is
a slight bathochromic shift of the UiO-66 BG to 3.8 eV observed upon
PANI functionalization. This is attributed to defects in the MOF structure
introduced during the synthesis of PANI nanofibers, which partially
decomposes the UiO-66 framework.30 The
amine functionality in turn shifts the MOF bandgap to 2.9 eV. Under
oxidative polymerization conditions, partial oxidation of the amine
group from TPA results in a new peak at 336 nm observed in the 1:1
and 2:1 spectra. Minimal shifting in PANI absorption bands and overlap
with MOF transitions is observed in 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 composites.

Figure 6 Average
sheet conductivity of all polymer-MOF hybrid composites
and PANI in S/sq.

Sheet conductivity was
measured using a four-point probe in an
inert atmosphere to provide information on both the concentration
of dopant (PANI) and the effects of using different linkers. The conducting
mechanism of PANI itself has been studied extensively, and it has
been shown that PANI is composed of conducting emeraldine salt grains
and insulating emeraldine base grains.31 When the grains π stack in one dimension, conducting grains
can perpetuate charge across the film more efficiently. The results
shown in Figure 6 indicate
that the insulating UiO-66 aggregate particles in the composite block
PANI fiber formation resulting in an increase in sheet resistivity.
However, as PANI concentration increases and the MOF aggregates begin
to decompose the PANI can readily stack conducting grains around the
needle like crystals observed in the PANI@UiO-66 composites. This
greater heterogeneity and high conductivity results in larger variability
observed in the 3:1 PANI@UiO-66 composite electrode.

The same
concentration effect on conduction is seen in the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites, but these materials ultimately possess much less
mobile charge carriers than the PANI@UiO-66 composites. As previously
shown, the UiO-66-NH2 MOF is more resistant to structural
collapse during oxidation and hydrothermal conditions, allowing for
better synergy between the UiO-66-NH2 framework and the
PANI polymer chains ultimately resulting in higher relative surface
areas (Table 2). This
causes nanofiber formation to be sterically hindered by small MOF
pores and directed linearly in all directions from MOF surface and
ultimately leads to poor film integrity, as evidenced by holes observed
in SEM images and less developed PANI network. The amine sites in
the MOF also act as a competing reductant for APS, which may result
in lower PANI yields despite providing surface site covalency. Ultimately,
the greater synergy and chemical stability of the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites come at the cost of low concentration of conduction
grains and bulk film stability.

5 Conclusions
The effects of aniline concentration, oxidant exposure, and linker
functionality on structural and electronic properties of PANI@UiO-66
and PANI@UiO-66-NH2 polymer-MOF hybrid composites were
thoroughly investigated. The PANI@MOF composites all display tunable
semiconducting behavior dependent on linker functionality and aniline
concentration during postsynthetic modification. The amine-functionalized
MOF shows higher chemical resilience to synthetic conditions for aniline
polymerization and ultimately greater cohesion with PANI nanofibers.
Conductivity measurements revealed a direct relationship between aniline
concentration and conduction. The greater synergy of the PANI@UiO-66-NH2 composites ultimately led to constrained fiber formation
and lower conductivity, but the MOF motif was retained after modification.
The UiO-66 MOF, however, is embedded noncovalently within the PANI
polymer network resulting in higher conductivities for PANI@UiO-66
composites but at the cost of MOF structural stability.
