Upon
mixing of aqueous solutions of the freely soluble
building blocks cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) and 4-sulfocalix[4]arene (SC[4]A),
white microcrystals instantly separate in near-quantitative yield.
The driving force for this assembly is suggested to be the outer-surface
interaction of the Q[n]. Dynamic light scattering,
scanning electron microscopy, and NMR (diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy)
analyses have confirmed the supramolecular aggregation of Q[7] and
SC[4]A. Titration 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration
calorimetry have shown that the interaction ratio of Q[7] and SC[4]A
is close to 3:1. Moreover, the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly
can accommodate molecules of some volatile compounds or luminescent
dyes. Thus, this work offers a simple and highly efficient means of
preparing adsorbent or solid fluorescent materials.

Introduction
Generally, supramolecular
assembly involves the formation of complexes
of molecules held together through noncovalent interactions,1−4 including hydrogen bonding,5−8 van der Waals forces,9,10 metal coordination,11−14 π–π interactions,15−18 and so on. It is the core of
supramolecular chemistry and has brought together supramolecular chemistry
and material science,19,20 polymer science,21−23 biomedical science,24−26 and catalysis.27−29 Therefore, supramolecular assembly
is regarded not only as a forefront of contemporary science,30,31 but also as the future of chemistry.31,32

Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s)33−37 have a long history, stretching back to 1905 when
Behrend and co-workers
reported a reaction between glycoluril and formaldehyde,33 although it took 76 years before Mock and co-workers
structurally assigned the first member of the Q[n] family, the cucurbituril Q[6].34 Q[n]s are characterized by a rigid hydrophobic cavity and
two polar portals rimmed with carbonyl groups and have proven to be
ideal building blocks for the construction of various supramolecular
assemblies, not only through host–guest interactions,38−43 but also metal ion coordination.44−47 From our own research and that
of others, it is clear that the electrostatically positive outer surface
of Q[n] can serve as a driving force in the formation
of various novel Q[n]-based supramolecular architectures
and materials,47−52 most notably in the presence of various inorganic anions, such as
polychloride d-transition metal anions [Md-blockClx]y−,53,54 polyoxometallate anions,49 and aromatic organic anions.55,56 We ascribe
such constructions to the so-called outer-surface interactions of
Q[n], including C–H···π
interactions between methine groups of glycoluril moieties of Q[n] and aromatic rings, π–π interactions
between carbonyl groups of glycoluril moieties of Q[n] and aromatic rings, hydrogen bonding between methine groups of
glycoluril moieties of Q[n] and protruded oxygen
atoms of polyoxometallate anions or inorganic cluster anions, but
mostly ion–dipole interactions between the electrostatically
positive outer surface of Q[n]s and inorganic or
organic anions.57,58

Like cucurbit[n]urls, calix[n]arenes also have a long history,
stretching back to 1872 when Baeyer
found that many products could be obtained from reactions between
phenols and aldehydes.59,60 After more than seven decades,
Zinke and Ziegler assigned some of these products,61,62 which were termed calixarenes by Gutsche in 1978.63 Generally, calix[n]arenes are also characterized
by a hydrophobic cavity constructed from n-phenyl
rings bridged by n-methylene groups. There is at
least one reactive site on each phenyl ring, allowing for easy functionalization
of these calix[n]arenes.64−66 As third-generation
hosts, calix[n]arenes, like cucurbit[n]urils, find various applications in drug delivery,67,68 sensing,69,70 separation and recognition,71,72 catalysis,73,74 and so on. 4-Sulfocalix[n]arenes75 (hereinafter abbreviated
as SC[n]As) contain not only aromatic rings but also
sulfonate groups, which can interact with the outer surface of Q[n]s. Thus, SC[n]As could be ideal building
blocks for the construction of Q[n]/SC[n]A-based supramolecular assemblies. Such supramolecular assemblies
may show not only the respective intrinsic properties of the Q[n] and SC[n]A but also new properties due
to their novel forms.

Referring to the first work on the supramolecular
assemblies of
Q[6] and SC[4 or 6]As by Lin and co-workers,76 water-soluble Q[7] (Figure 1a) and SC[4]A (Figure 1b) were selected as building blocks. White microcrystals precipitated
almost instantaneously in near-quantitative yield (>90%) upon simple
mixing of solutions of Q[7] and SC[4]A in neutral water. Dynamic light
scattering (DLS), diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
further confirmed the supramolecular aggregation of Q[7] and SC[4]A. 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
showed the interaction ratio of Q[7] and SC[4]A to be close to 3:1.
It was anticipated that such a supramolecular assembly would have
space to accommodate molecules of some volatile compounds or fluorescent
dyes, such that it might be used as an adsorbent material or a solid
fluorescent material.

Results and Discussion
Interaction of Q[7] with
SC[4]A
Both Q[7] and SC[4]A
are water soluble. However, mixing their aqueous solutions almost
instantaneously produces a white precipitate in near-quantitative
yield (>90%). This phenomenon suggests a strong interaction between
these components, which we interpret as an outer-surface interaction
of the Q[n], including the π–π
interaction of the carbonyl bonds of Q[7] with the aromatic rings
of SC[4]A and ion–dipole interaction between the electropositive
outer surface of Q[7] and the electronegative sulfonyl groups of SC[4]A.57 To probe the interaction of Q[7] and SC[4]A
in more detail, we first used a titration 1H NMR technique
to determine their interaction in neutral D2O. The experimental
results showed that SC[4]A gradually disappeared from the solution
with increasing number of equivalents of Q[7] and the ratio of precipitated
Q[7] to SC[4]A was close to 3:1 (Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The assembled supramolecular
precipitate can dissolve in acidic solution. Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of
the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based precipitate redissolved in 4 M DCl/D2O solution, along with the spectra of pure Q[7] and SC[4]A
in the same acidic medium. Compared to those of the pure molecules,
the signals of both Q[7] and SC[4]A in the supramolecular assembly
showed some changes in chemical shift. For the Q[7] molecule, all
proton resonances experienced an upfield shift (Δδ ≈
0.02 ppm), suggesting that these molecules reside in a shielding area.
For the SC[4]A molecule, all proton resonances experienced a downfield
shift (Δδ ≈ 0.05 ppm), suggesting that these molecules
reside in a deshielding area, that is, at the portals of the Q[7]
molecules.

(c) Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly, each in 4 M DCl/D2O solution.

Diffusion-ordered NMR
spectroscopy (DOSY) is commonly employed
to confirm an aggregation system in solution, since the results can
directly correlate the 1H NMR signals between two interacting
components with the corresponding diffusion coefficient.77−80 In the present case, the DOSY spectrum of a sample with a 3:1 ratio
of Q[7] and SC[4]A in D2O was recorded. The average diffusion
coefficient for the Q[7] component was evaluated as 6.10 × 1010 m2 s–1, as compared to 4.20
× 10–10 m2 s–1 for the SC[4]A component. On mixing the two components in a 3:1
ratio in D2O, the average diffusion coefficient decreased
to 3.20 × 10–10 m2 s–1. This obvious decrease in the diffusion coefficient implies that
the two components become aggregated (Figure S2 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information).

Isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements can provide
quantitative physical and chemical data for an interaction system.
Thus, a solution of SC[4]A was incrementally injected into a solution
of Q[7] (0.10 mM) at 25 °C to record the exothermic binding isotherm
(Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).
The interaction molar ratio determined was 0.36, close to the 3:1
ratio of Q[7] to SC[4]A, and the interaction association constant
(Ka) of the two components was evaluated
as (2.13 ± 0.23) × 105. Moreover, the relatively
large negative enthalpy reveals that the assembly process is typically
driven by a favorable enthalpy change (Table S3 in the Supporting Information).

Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
can also provide aggregation information
on an interaction system. Figure 3 shows DLS data for Q[7]/SC[4]A obtained by simply
mixing solutions of Q[7] and SC[4]A in a molar ratio of 3:1. A single
hydrodynamic diameter distribution centered at around 375 nm can be
seen, attributable to the formation of aggregated assemblies, as compared
to distributions centered at 4.4 nm for Q[7] and 4.1 nm for SC[4]A.

assembly in neutral water at 25 °C.

Thus far, we have described the supramolecular assembly of
Q[7]
and SC[4]A in aqueous solution, which instantaneously yields less
water-soluble microcrystals with a certain interaction ratio (3:1
Q[7] to SC[4]A). Although we have tried various methods, we have not
yet succeeded in obtaining suitable single crystals of the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based
supramolecular assembly. A powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern
of the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based assembly suggested that it was partially
crystallized (Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information). An SEM image provided direct visual information for
the formation of the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly, with
particle diameters in the range 0.2–0.9 μm (Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows a TEM image of the
highly dispersed Q[7]/SC[4]A-based aggregate in acetonitrile; the
sizes of the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based aggregates are in the range of 4–13
nm. Close inspection reveals that each aggregate in the image is actually
a nanosized crystal (Figure 4c). The numerous channels between these Q[7]/SC[4]A-based
aggregates or nanocrystals could make this supramolecular assembly
potentially useful for the absorption of volatile compounds or fluorophore
molecules.

assembly; inset, an enhanced TEM image of nanosized crystal in the
Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly.

The thermal stability of the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular
assembly
was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis in nitrogen (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). It
was found that the assembly underwent weight loss in two stages. The
first stage was assigned to the evaporation of intramolecular and
intermolecular water, with a maximum at 112 °C, as compared to
149 °C for Q[7] and 122 °C for SC[4]A. The peak temperature
of decomposition and carbonization was 413 °C, higher than those
of 388 °C for Q[7] and 320 °C for SC[4]A.

Adsorption
Behaviors of the Q[7]/SC[4]A-Based Supramolecular
Assembly
In spite of the absence of a single-crystal X-ray
structure, the basic interaction between Q[7] and SC[4]A was characterized
using various techniques. The water-insoluble microcrystals could
be redissolved in HCl, and the interaction ratio of Q[7] and SC[4]A
was established as 3:1. Most importantly, microscopy revealed extensive
channels between the microcrystals and the empty cavities of Q[7],
and SC[4]A themselves could make the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular
assembly a promising adsorbent material.

Previous work has revealed
that various Q[n]-based supramolecular assemblies
exhibit selective adsorption of different volatile compounds. For
example, a Q[5]/K+/p-hydroxybenzoic acid
ternary supramolecular assembly exhibits highly selective methanol
adsorption,81 and two different hemimethyl-substituted
Q[6]-based supramolecular assemblies show strong preferences for methanol
adsorption and diethyl ether adsorption, respectively.82 In the present case, various channels can be
observed in the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly and the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of the activated
assembly, as calculated from the isotherm, is 3.1 m2 g–1 (Figure S7 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information). Further experimental results showed
that the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly exhibits different
adsorption properties for selected volatile compounds (gram per gram).
The respective capacities are 0.14 g for methanol, 0.09 g for ethanol,
0.06 g for acetone, 0.10 g for acetonitrile, 0.21 g for dichloromethane,
0.23 g for trichloromethane, 0.22 g for tetrachloromethane, 0.12 g
for diethyl ether, and 0.10 g for n-hexane (Figure 5 and Table S4). Thus, it exhibits a somewhat higher
selectivity for polychloromethanes. Compared to the related capacities
of Q[7] and SC[4]A alone, there are no significant differences among
these three hosts, except that Q[7] shows a higher capacity for methanol
(0.42 g).

Considering not only the various
channels between the microcrystals
but also the probable empty cavities of Q[7] and SC[4]A in the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based
supramolecular assembly, we anticipated that such an assembly would
also have space to accommodate molecules of various fluorescent compounds
and thereby yield solid fluorescent materials. Referring to the method
used in ref (83), a
mixed solvent (water/acetonitrile, 1:9, v/v) was eventually selected
for all experiments in this work. Some typical fluorophore guests,
such as G1, G2, G3, and G4, were selected for adsorption on the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based
supramolecular assembly (Figure 6a). Experimental results indicated that the supramolecular
assembly adsorption-based luminescent materials exhibited fluorescence
emissions in the solid state. For example, loading the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based
supramolecular assembly with G4 (G4@Q[7]/SC[4]A) gave a powder that
appeared light-orange under daylight, with a bright-yellow fluorescence
emission with maximum intensity at 579 nm, compared to the red G4
under daylight, and very weak dark-red fluorescence emission with
maximum intensity at 637 nm under 365 nm UV light (Figure 6b,c). In comparison, loading
pure Q[7] or pure SC[4] with G4 gave powders that appeared light-yellow
or pale-white, respectively, under daylight, with a weak light-blue
(λexc = 561 nm) or weak light-purple (λexc = 558 nm) fluorescence emission under 365 nm UV light (Figure 6b,c). Significant
changes were seen for G4, not only in color (from red, 637 nm, to
bright-yellow, 579 nm) but also in the strength of the fluorescence
emission (over 74 times under the same experimental condition). The
results of other adsorption experiments are presented in Figures S8–S10 in the Supporting Information.
It is interesting that the interactions of different dyes with the
Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly gave rise to different fluorescence
emission phenomena. For example, the assembly adsorbs G1 and exhibits
an enhanced blue fluorescence emission; there are no obvious differences
from G1 itself or the G1/Q[7] or G1/SC[4]A systems (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). Similar phenomena
can be observed for G2 and the G2/Q[7]/SC[4]A, G2/Q[7], and G2/SC[4]A
systems (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information).
The fluorescence emissions of the G3/Q[7]/SC[4]A, G3/Q[7], and G3/SC[4]A
systems show obvious changes compared to that of G3. The wavelengths
of maximum intensity are 487 nm (cyan) for G3/Q[7]/SC[4]A, 488 nm
(cyan) for G3/Q[7], and 507 nm (green) for G3/SC[4]A, as compared
to 457 nm (blue) for G3 (Figure S10 in
the Supporting Information). We also investigated the interactions
of these dyes with Q[7] or SC[4]A alone (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). 1H NMR titration
experiments revealed that Q[7] or SC[4]A can include all of these
dye guests, except that interaction of G1 with SC[4]A resulted in
the formation of a precipitate, suggesting that the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based
supramolecular assembly could not only include dye molecule guests
in the cavities of Q[7] or SC[4]A units but also in its channels.

solid G4 (λexc = 637 nm); G4 + Q[7] (λexc = 561 nm), G4 + SC[4]A (λexc = 558 nm),
and G4 + Q[7]/SC[4]A (λexc = 579 nm).

Further adsorption capacity experiments were performed
by immersing
the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly (10 mg) in a solution
(0.5 mL) containing a dye (2 × 10–3 M) (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). The
loading capacities for the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly
(mol g–1) were evaluated as 5.26 × 10–5 for G1, 4.74 × 10–5 for G2, 4.10 × 10–5 for G3, and 9.20 × 10–5 for
G4.

Conclusions
In summary, by combining water-soluble
Q[7] and SC[4]A as building
blocks, a simple method for synthesizing a Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular
assembly with numerous channels has been demonstrated. The driving
force for construction of this supramolecular assembly is suggested
to be the outer-surface interaction of Q[7]. Titration 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) have
indicated that the interaction ratio of Q[7] and SC[4]A is close to
3:1. Moreover, the Q[7]/SC[4]A-based supramolecular assembly can not
only accommodate some volatile compounds, in particular, polychloromethanes,
but can also selectively adsorb certain organic dyes to yield multiemitting,
including white-light-emitting, solid fluorescent materials. Thus,
the present work not only further enriches the palette of supramolecular
assemblies based on the outer-surface interaction of cucurbit[n]urils, but also combines two major branches of macrocyclic
chemistry, cucurbit[n]uril chemistry, and calixarene
chemistry, in one system. More importantly, such study might open
up new Q[n]-based supramolecular chemistry in the
fields of porous materials and light emitters. More extensive investigations
on the Q[n]/C[n]A-based supramolecular
assemblies and their functions are currently underway.

Experimental
Section
Materials
SC[4]A was purchased from TCI. Q[7] was prepared
in our laboratory according to a literature method.35,36 Other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from
Aladdin and used as received without further purification.

Measurements
All 1H NMR spectra, including
those for titration experiments and DOSY spectra, were recorded at
20 °C from solutions in D2O on a Varian Inova-400
spectrometer. TEM images were obtained with an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 field-emission
transmission electron microscope. SEM images were obtained with a
Zeiss∑IGMA+X-Max20 field-emission scanning electron microscope
(for SEM imaging, Au (1–2 nm) was sputtered onto the grids
to prevent charging effects and to improve the image clarity).

DLS Measurements
DLS data were obtained on a Brookhaven
BI-APDX apparatus at 25 °C. Sample solutions for DLS measurements
were prepared by filtration through a 450 nm Millipore filter into
a clean scintillation vial. DLS measurements were first performed
on separate aqueous solutions of either Q[7] and SC[4]A. These solutions
were then mixed and further DLS measurements were carried out in the
same way. All of the DLS measurements were performed at a scattering
angle of 90°.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Experiments
ITC measurements were performed on a Nano ITC instrument (TA).
All
solutions were prepared in purified water and degassed prior to titration
experiments. Thirty consecutive 8 μL aliquots of a 10 mM solution
of SC[4]A were injected into the microcalorimetric reaction cell containing
1 mL of 1 mM Q[7] solution at 25 °C. A correction for heat of
dilution was applied by injecting the SC[4]A solution into deionized
water and subtracting these data from those of the Q[7] – SC[4]A
titration. Computer simulations (curve fitting) were performed using
the Nano ITC analyze software.

Preparation of Q[7]/SC[4]A-Based
Supramolecular Assembly
SC[4]A (0.04 g, 0.05 mmol) and Q[7]
(0.2 g, 0.15 mmol) were separately
dissolved in water. The Q[7] solution was then added dropwise to the
SC[4]A solution with stirring, whereupon a white flocculent precipitate
was immediately formed almost quantitatively. This precipitate was
collected by filtration; yield: 0.205 g (85%).

Adsorption Studies on the
Q[7]/SC[4]A-Based Supramolecular Assembly
with Selected Volatile Compounds
The requisite amount of
solid assembly (0.5–1.0 g) contained in a tared open glass
phial was placed in a sealable glass vessel, which was then evacuated
with the aid of a vacuum pump. Pumping was continued until the sample
achieved constant weight. A second open container containing a few
milliliter of a volatile liquid, either methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, diethyl ether, acetonitrile, dichloromethane,
trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, or acetone was then added, and
the vessel was resealed. The weight change of the sample was then
determined at 0.25–1 h intervals over 24 h to obtain the vapor
absorption profile.

Preparation of Q[7]/SC[4]A/Dye Solid-State
Fluorescent Materials
Portions (10.0 mg) of Q[7]/SC[4]A were
added to aliquots (0.5 mL)
of 0.01 M solutions of dyes in acetonitrile. The mixtures
were stirred for 1 min. Powder samples with different colored fluorescences
were recovered by filtration: cyan with pyrenemethanamine hydrochloride
(G1), blue with umbelliferone (G2), cyan with levofloxacin hemihydrate
(G3), and yellow with 2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium
iodide (G4).
