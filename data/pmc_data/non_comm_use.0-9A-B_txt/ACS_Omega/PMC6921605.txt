In this article, synthesis of white-light-emitting, highly
stable
carbon dots (CDs) using a colloidal synthesis technique is reported.
It has been observed that the use of a non-coordinating solvent plays
a vital role in the successful fabrication of highly stable CDs. Dilution-independent
emissive behavior in CDs is achieved. Excitation-energy-dependent
emissive behavior is observed in CDs. However, by surface passivating
the CD core by using hexadecylamine (HDA), excitation wavelength dependence
of emission is successfully minimized. Surface-functionalized CDs
(SFCDs) show blue to green light tunable emission with the change
in synthesis conditions. HDA also plays an important role in achieving
dilution-independent emission in SFCDs. Furthermore, the carbon dots
synthesized are highly inert, and their emission spectra are unaffected
on exposure to an open atmosphere for as long as 9 days. A new class
of highly crystalline carbon dots called “carbon onion rings”
is reported.

Introduction
Quantum dots are semiconductor nanoparticles
with confinement of
charge carriers in all the three dimensions.1 Due to this charge carrier confinement, they fluoresce at specific
wavelengths based on the energy band structure of the quantum dot
formed.2 Majority of conventional quantum
dots are based on toxic and environmentally hazardous heavy-metal
ions. Due to these shortcomings, there is a high demand for the synthesis
of benign nanomaterials with similar or better optical properties.
On the other hand, carbon dots (CDs) with equivalent optical properties
come across as nanomaterials with low toxicity. Moreover, CDs are
resistant to photobleaching and photoblinking, show higher luminescence,
and large two photon cross section areas,3−9 which makes them highly beneficial for applications ranging from
LED sources,10 temperature sensors11,12 (nanothermometry) to bioimaging.13,14 Furthermore,
carbon is widely available in nature at low cost, thus increasing
the potential of CDs to replace semiconductor quantum dots in photonic
devices and sensor applications. However, most of the fabricated CDs
reported until now have shown excitation energy and dilution dependent
emissive behavior,15−17 leaving them sterile for applications that require
a controlled and dilution-independent emission.18−20 In this paper,
a novel synthesis technique, which leads to highly stable CDs, is
reported. White-light-emitting, highly luminescent CDs have been successfully
fabricated. It is observed that the fabrication parameters play a
major role in the stability of the dots. Dilution-independent photoluminescence
(PL) behavior is achieved by controlling the temperature of the reaction
and using a non-coordinating solvent during synthesis. CD surface
passivation is achieved by using HDA as the surface-functionalizing
agent. By passivating the surface groups on the carbon core, excitation
wavelength dependence of the emission is minimized. It is observed
that the ratio of molar concentration of HDA (surface-functionalizing
agent)/citric acid (carbon source) plays a major role in the stability
of SFCDs. Furthermore, by passivating the carbon core, a better control
in growth of CDs is achieved, which leads to blue- and green-emitting
dots. Highly stable emission behavior on exposure of CDs to an open
atmosphere and water for long durations is reported.

Chemical Synthesis
CDs were synthesized using a colloidal
synthesis technique under
an inert atmosphere at a high temperature of 300 °C. For bare
CDs, citric acid (C6H807) was used
as a carbon precursor, and octadecene (C18H36, ODE) was used as a high-boiling-point solvent. 0.3 M solution of
citric acid (1 g) in (15 mL) octadecene was prepared and transferred
to a reaction flask. With a stirring rate of 100 rpm, the reaction
flask was heated at 300 °C for 1 h. CD formation involved pyrolysis
of citric acid followed by carbonization. Heating above the melting
point of citric acid led to the breakdown of citric acid molecules
followed by polymerization to form carbon clusters. At high temperatures,
these carbon clusters carbonized to form the carbon core leading to
CD nuclei. After a synthesis time of 1 h at 300 °C, the solution
containing CD precipitates was purified using ethanol to separate
the quantum dot precipitate. The CDs were then dispersed in chloroform.
SFCDs were prepared by using citric acid as the carbon source, octadecene
as the high-boiling-point solvent, and hexadecyl amine (HDA) as the
surface-functionalizing agent. For synthesizing these dots, 0.2 M
(1.5 gm) HDA was added to the reaction flask along with (15 mL) ODE
and (1 g) citric acid. SFCDs were prepared at different HDA concentrations
varying from 0.1 to 0.4 M. With a stirring rate of 100 rpm, the reaction
flask was heated at 300 °C for 1 h. CD formation involved pyrolysis
accompanied by carbonization followed by surface functionalization
of CDs. HDA acts as a ligand, which passivates the surface groups.
Samples collected were purified using ethanol to separate the quantum
dot precipitate and henceforth were dispersed in chloroform. The
fabrication process is summarized through a schematic as shown in Figure 1a−b. The synthesized
bare CDs under UV light showed white-light emission (Figure 1c). White-light emission from
bare carbon dots can be used to fabricate white-light-emitting devices.21−24 SFCDs under UV light showed blue (452) to green (541) color emissions
at different HDA/citric acid molar concentrations ranging from 0.3
to 1.3 (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
for synthesis process of carbon dots (CDs). Initially,
the solution is clear. Gradually, with the increase in reaction temperature
and time, nucleation followed by growth (steps 1, 2) takes place with
a change in color of the solution from pale yellow to brown. Surface
functionalization will take place for SFCDs in step 3. (b) The corresponding
meaning of steps 1, 2, and 3 in the reaction mechanism is explained.
Carbon dots are formed by pyrolysis and then carbonization of citric
acid. ODE acts as a high-boiling-point solvent. For SFCDs, HDA acts
as a surface-functionalizing agent. (c) The synthesized bare CDs under
UV light show white-light emission. SFCDs under UV light show blue
(452 nm) to green (541 nm) color emissions at different HDA/citric
acid molar concentrations. Blue light for sample with molar concentration
ratio HDA/citric acid = 0.3, and green color for samples with molar
concentration ratios HDA/citric acid = 0.6, 1.0, and 1.3 (from left
to right).

Results and Discussion
To further explore the nanostructures,
the as-prepared CDs have
been analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Low-magnification
images show that the particles are spherical in shape. Wide particle
size distribution is observed in the bare (Figure 2a–c) as well as surface-functionalized
CDs (Figure 2g). Average
size of bare CDs is around ∼4 nm. HRTEM images show the particles
to be crystalline in nature. Two different crystal structures appear
at different reaction conditions. Onion rings (Figure 2d) appear when the reaction temperatures
(300 °C) and reaction duration (1 h) are high, while at lower
temperatures and times, parallel lattice planes (Figure 2e) in the CDs are observed.
Bare CD samples are synthesized at high temperatures, which lead to
the formation of hexagonal-shaped carbon onion rings as shown in HRTEM
images. This kind of onion-shaped ring structure has been observed
by Iijima et al. during formation of amorphous carbon films by the
vacuum deposition method at high temperatures and pressures.25 When the graphitic structure of carbon containing
trigonal sp2 state C–C bonds are heated at high
temperatures, the trigonal C–C bond gets strained and a tetrahedral
sp3 C–C bond is formed, which leads to the onion
ring structure.25 At short synthesis duration
and temperatures below 300 °C, only parallel lattice planes are
observed. The HRTEM images clearly indicate a lattice spacing of 0.32
nm in ring geometry and 0.32, 0.29, and 0.21 nm in planar geometries.
However, interplanar spacings of 0.32, 0.29, and 0.20 nm are observed
in SFCDs as shown in Figure 2g. A lattice spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (002) plane
of the graphitic crystal structure, and 0.21 and 0.20 nm corresponds
to the (100) and (101) planes, respectively. Selected area diffraction
(SAED) images of synthesized bare CDs also support the crystalline
nature of carbon dots. Absorption and emission spectra of the as-prepared
CDs and SFCDs are recorded. It is observed that the bare as well as
SFCDs absorb in the UV region and emit in the visible region. Bare
CDs absorb in a broad range starting from wavelengths <830 nm
and show a steep absorption edge at ∼300 nm. No prominent absorption
peak is observed in the absorption spectra of bare CDs (Figure 3a). The emission spectra obtained
from the bare CDs is observed to range from ∼300 to 600 nm
with an emission maximum at 417 nm (Figure 3a). The full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of PL spectra of CDs observed is 141 nm at 300 nm incident excitation
wavelength (λex). The surface of CDs is decorated
with various functional groups (−COC, C=O, etc., Figure 5), which absorb at different
energies and emit accordingly. These surface groups do not emit on
their own, but when attached to the carbon dot surface, they share
their lone pair of electrons with the π orbitals of the intrinsic
carbon core and act as emissive trap sites.26 These groups manifest as energy levels at different energies in
the band gap of the material. The overlap of emission due to these
energy levels leads to a single broad peak at λex of 300 nm. However, large particle size distribution is also observed
in the as-fabricated samples, which is corroborated by the broad absorption
range (300–830 nm) and wide particle size distribution showing
TEM images. Therefore, the wide FWHM observed is due to the cumulative
effect of wide particle size distribution and superposition of emission
due to various (−COC, C=O) surface groups (surface emissive
traps formed during the synthesis of CDs). These bare CDs emit white
light under UV-lamp illumination. Also, they show a quantum yield
(QY) of 4%. Henceforth, to increase the quantum yield and passivate
the surface groups on the carbon core and thereby to enhance the stability
of CDs, SFCDs using HDA are fabricated and investigated. Furthermore,
HDA provides a better control of the reaction, and higher emission
intensity is anticipated due to quenching of surface dangling bonds
present on the CD surface. Absorption spectra of the SFCDs depict
a substantial absorption for wavelengths ≤500 nm with a strong
absorption peak at ∼368 nm (Figure 3b). The SFCDs emit in the range of 370 to
600 nm, with a maximum at 450 nm (Figure 3b). FWHM in photoluminescence (PL) spectra
of SFCDs is ∼120 nm at λex of 300 nm. As
compared to bare CDs, it appears that, in SFCDs, a part of the blue
emission (350–430 nm) due to surface groups is quenched by
HDA and a red shift in emission maxima is observed. A QY of 31% has
been observed for SFCDs. Wavelength dependence of emission spectra
is investigated for λex ranging from 250 to 400 nm.
On illumination of bare CDs with different excitation energies, a
variation in emission wavelength and intensity is observed. There
is an increase in emission intensity with the increase in λex up to 370 nm, and on further increase in λex above 370 nm, the emission intensity decreases (Figure 4a). Variation in emission intensity
at different λex’s corresponds to the density
of surface groups attached to the carbon core. Furthermore, the emission
maxima red shifts by 54 nm on increase in λex from
250 to 400 nm. Excitation-energy-dependent emission is due to the
presence of wide particle size distribution and surface groups, which
act as emissive trap sites on CDs. Different-sized dots and surface
groups excite at different energies and emit correspondingly. In bare
CDs, it is observed that the λex-dependent emission
peak shift is more prominent in the 350–400 nm λex range. Furthermore, by surface functionalizing the bare
dots, a higher control on size of the dot and quenching of surface
states is achieved, which is prominent in the emission spectra of
SFCDs with the variation in λex. In the emission
spectra of SFCDs (HDA/citric acid = 2, Figure 4b), the emission peak shift in the 350–400
nm λex range is minimized. When HDA concentration
is further increased (HDA/citric acid = 3), a more stable λex-independent emission in the 350–400 nm λex range is observed (Figure 4c). A dual emission window is observed in the emission
spectra of SFCDs (HDA/citric acid = 3) at λex ranging
from 270 to 320 nm (Figure 4c). This dual emission is due to amino groups getting attached
to the carbon core in SFCDs. This behavior clearly indicates the passivation
of the surface groups on the CDs. Considering the origin of peaks
from two different sources, although two peaks are observed, there
is no shift in the emission maxima of each peak. Thus, it could be
concluded that HDA passivates the surface groups and stable emission
is achieved. Furthermore, the presence of different functional groups
on the surface of CDs is confirmed by FTIR spectra (Figure 5). The absorption signals at 1045 and 995 cm–1 correspond to C–O–C stretching vibrations. Peaks at
1701 and 1640 cm–1 correspond to C=O stretching
vibration. The absorption values at 3076, 3022, 2924, and 2853 cm–1 correspond to CHx (x = 2, 3) stretching vibrations. The band at 1464 cm–1 corresponds to C–H bending modes. The absorption
peaks between 1653 and 1520 cm–1 correspond to CONH
stretching vibrations. C–O–C stretching vibrations are
deformed in the FTIR spectra of SFCDs, and N–H and CONH stretching
vibrations are observed. In order to check the effect of dilution
on the emission spectra of bare carbon dots and SFCDs, different concentrations
of CDs are dispersed in chloroform and the emission spectra are recorded.
It is observed that, for the bare CDs, the emission intensity decreases
with the increase in dilution of CDs (Figure 6a). A similar behavior is also observed in
SFCDs (Figure 6c).
This decrease in emission intensity is attributed to the decreasing
concentration of the CDs in the solvent. However, in the bare CDs,
the emission maximum wavelength does not shift by a change in dilution
(Figure 6b), which
is attributed to the use of ODE during synthesis. Proper selection
of solvent, synthesis temperature, and concentration of precursors
during synthesis play a very important role in the emissive behavior
of CDs. Most of the CDs reported until now have been synthesized by
hydrothermal synthesis using water as a solvent, pre- and postsynthesis.27,28 Water acts as a source of OH– ions, which get
attached to C=O surface groups on CDs and act as emissive traps. Depending
on the concentration of the solvent (water), more or fewer OH– ions gets attached to the CD surface, and this leads
to dilution-dependent PL behavior in CDs. Since the solvent (ODE)
chosen in our synthesis is non-coordinating and nonpolar, it does not modify the surface of CDs during
synthesis. Hence, the CDs synthesized show dilution-independent emissive
behavior. This dilution-independent emission in CDs can find wide
applications in concentration-sensitive device applications (e.g.,
in chemical sensing). In SFCDs, HDA acts as a source of amino groups
to the carbon surface, and thus, stability of SFCDs is disturbed.
In SFCDs, the molar concentration ratio of HDA/citric acid plays a
vital role in achieving dilution-independent stable emission. For
HDA concentration ∼0.5 times the molar concentration of citric
acid, a large blue shift of 108 nm is observed in the diluted sample
(Figure 6d). With the
increase in HDA concentration, the effect of dilution on the emission
maximum shift decreases (Figure 6d–g). When the molar concentration of HDA is
greater than or equal to twice that of citric acid, SFCDs show dilution-independent
emission behavior because the amount of HDA is enough to completely
passivate the CD surface. Moreover, due to stearic hindrance between
two adjacent CDs, CD–CD interdot interactions can be greatly
reduced leading to dilution-independent emission behavior. Furthermore,
aging and photostability of the CDs are studied by exposing bare CDs
and SFCDs to an open atmosphere for a span of 9 days before taking
the emission spectra. The maximum emission count for bare CDs when
excited at 250 nm (Figure 7a) is of the order of 105, while it is of the order
of 106 in SFCDs (Figure 7c). The intensity increases to the order of 106 when excited by 350 nm in bare CDs (Figure 7b) and it increases to 107 in
SFCDs (Figure 7d).
On increase in exposure time of CDs to an open atmosphere, the emission
intensity decreases in the case of CDs excited at 250 and 350 nm and
SFCDs excited at 250 nm. However, there is an increase in intensity
with the increase in exposure duration in SFCDs when excited at 350
nm. Although there is a decrease in the count among bare CDs (λex = 250 and 350 nm) and SFCD (λex = 250 nm)
and increase in SFCDs (λex = 350 nm), the order of
magnitude remains the same. Furthermore, the normalized emission spectra
seem to be completely unaffected by exposure to an open atmosphere.
So, in conclusion, although the emission count varies, but it should
be emphasized that the intensity remains almost of the same order
of magnitude on exposure to an open atmosphere for as long as 216
h. Furthermore, to find out the effect of water (polar solvent) on
the emission behavior, the CDs and SFCDs are placed in water for a
span of 17 days before taking the emission spectra. It is observed
that CDs and SFCDs are almost insoluble in water (Figure 8a). Bare CDs float over the
surface of water, which get dispersed in water on vigorous stirring.
SFCDs are completely insoluble in water and stick to the walls at
the bottom of the vial. In bare CDs, the surface has few polar groups
such as −C=O and C–O, due to which slight miscibility
in water is observed. However, in SFCDs, these polar groups (C=O)
are passivated by (−NH2–R). Because of the
presence of alkyl groups (nonpolar) at the terminal ends of −NH2–R, highly insoluble behavior in water is observed.
Emission spectra of CDs and SFCDs dispersed in water are recorded
after 17 days (Figure 8b−d). Two incident wavelengths (250 and 350 nm) were used
to excite the QDs. There is a decrease in emission intensity in all
samples in water as compared to CHCl3. The CDs and SFCDs
were highly immiscible in water, which renders the CD concentration
to be very low, leading to lower emission intensity. However, in SFCDs,
the emission intensity is drastically low due to the highly immiscible
nature of dots. SFCDs stick at the bottom walls of the vial, and therefore,
the emission spectra is obtained by the very low concentration of
dots that might be soluble in water (Figure 8).

Conclusions
In summary, the synthesis technique to
obtain highly stable carbon
dots is discussed. Highly luminescent white-light-emitting CDs are
fabricated and characterized. The carbon dots synthesized are chemically
inert, and their emission spectra are unaffected on exposure to an
open atmosphere. Parameters affecting emission behavior of CDs are
discussed. Dilution, excitation wavelength, solvent, and atmospheric
effects on emission are discussed using UV absorption spectroscopy,
PL emission spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. Emission
behavior of CDs in polar solvents such as water is discussed. These
highly stable CDs find wide applications in fabricating various photonic
devices. These organic CDs are prepared using a green synthesis route
and can be highly beneficial for sensor, bio-, and LED applications.
