Theoretically, the edges of a MoS2 flake and
S-vacancy
within the lattice have nearly zero Gibbs free energy for hydrogen
adsorption, which is essentially correlated to the exchange currents
in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, MoS2 possesses
insufficient active sites (edges and S-vacancies) in pristine form.
Interestingly, active sites can be effectively engineered within the
continuous MoS2 sheets by treating it with plasma in a
controlled manner. Here, we employed N2 plasma on a large-area
continuous-monolayer MoS2 synthesized via metal–organic
chemical vapor deposition to acquire maximum active sites that are
indeed required for an efficient HER performance. The MoS2 samples with maximum active sites were acquired by optimizing the
plasma exposure time. The newly induced edges and S-vacancies were
directly verified by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.
The 20 min treated MoS2 sample showed maximum active sites
and thereby maximum HER activity, onset overpotential of ∼−210
mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Tafel slope of ∼89
mV/dec. Clearly, the above results show that this approach can be
employed for improving the HER efficiency of large-scale MoS2-based electrocatalysts.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) gas is an excellent source of clean energy
and perceived as a suitable alternative for hydrocarbon-based fuels.1−4 Hydrogen is abundant in diverse natural compounds such as water,
hydrocarbons, and so on. Hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) from
water-splitting reaction that breaks the H–O bond and releases
oxygen and hydrogen in gaseous form can be achieved through an electrochemical
or a photo-electrochemical process.5−8 These processes are essentially facilitated
by the introduction of a catalytic substance. The best catalytic substances
known for efficient HER are the Pt metal and/or Pt-based materials,9 which are not viable economically.2,10 Therefore, finding new cost-effective materials with comparable
or even better HER performance is highly desirable.

Two-dimensional
(2D) materials, such as MoS2, have been
widely investigated for electronics and optoelectronic applications.11−13 MoS2 also possesses great potential in terms of HER owing
to its structural stability, high electrocatalytic activity, and earth
abundance.14−16 The electrochemical reaction that produces H2 gas mainly occurs at the outmost layer and/or at the edges
of MoS2 where the active sites are located.14,15,17−20 The inner layers do not take
part in the reaction. Therefore, monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) is more suitable for HER compared to bulk counterpart. Another
advantage of 1L-MoS2 is the relatively easy transfer of
an electron from the active sites to the electrode due to maximum
hopping of electrons in the vertical direction.17,21 This phenomenon essentially reduces the contact resistance required
for an efficient reaction. However, crystalline 1L-MoS2 has a low density of active sites in a pristine form that limits
the HER performance. Interestingly, active sites in MoS2 can be engineered by various strategies, such as, doping,20,22 forming cracks on the surface,23,24 and creating
S-vacancies.25,26 The 1L-MoS2 with a
high edge density and defects could be an excellent catalytic material
for an efficient HER.

Pertinently, MoS2 grown over
an Au foil via conventional
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) showed excellent HER performance and
Tafel slope of 61 mV/dec attributed to the excellent coupling between
the Au substrate and MoS2.27 On the other hand, a relatively cost-effective approach is the enhancement
of HER performance by engineering defects in CVD-grown MoS2 on SiO2 substrate using plasma treatment or hydrogen
annealing.24 However, 2D MoS2 samples grown by conventional CVD also could not break the limitation
in terms of cost-effectiveness, as the sample area is typically limited
to ∼1 cm2 or below per synthesis. Such a drawback
arises from the utilization of a solid-phase inorganic precursor (mostly
MoO3 and sulfur powder). In contrast, the metal–organic
CVD (MOCVD) technique uses gas-phase precursors and therefore offers
a wafer-scale area of 1L-MoS2 on arbitrary substrates.
Moreover, the low reaction rate, low reaction temperature, and precisely
controllable flow rate of precursors make MOCVD suitable to yield
uniform, conformal, and wafer-scale 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs).28−33 These properties fulfill the essential requirements for economical
and scalable HER electrocatalytic application.

In this article,
we synthesized a large-scale 1L-MoS2 via MOCVD and employed
N2-plasma treatment to induce
more active sites that are required for an efficient HER. The creation
of active sites by N2 plasma was confirmed by inspecting
the surface morphology and the crystal structure by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM). Micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) and Raman
spectroscopies were employed to study the effect of N2 plasma
on the optical characteristics of MoS2. Both microscopic
and spectroscopic characterization tools clearly showed that increasing
the treatment time results in the formation of more active sites (edges
and S-vacancies). The optimum treatment time is about 20 min that
yielded the best HER activity. We believe that our simple post-treatment
technique can be widely employed for improving the HER efficiency
of transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD)-based electrocatalysts in
general.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphological and Structural Analysis
Initially, a large-area crystalline continuous 1L-MoS2 film was grown by MOCVD, as discussed in Section 4.1. The crystalline MoS2 shows
a poor HER performance because of the low density of active sites,
which are essential for HER activity. Nevertheless, the active sites
including edges and S-vacancy sites can be generated by using N2-plasma treatment. We employed N2 plasma on 1L-MoS2 to induce active sites, as schematically depicted in Figure 1b,c. The creation
of active sites was comparatively studied by inspecting the surface
morphologies of 1L-MoS2 treated with N2 plasma
for various times. Evidently, the untreated sample shows a perfectly
clean surface with no apparent cracks or deformation (Figure S2a). However, a network of cracks, which
work as active sites, begins to appear in the plasma-treated films
(Figure S2b,c). The density of cracks was
found to be increased with the treatment time. The FE-SEM image of
20 min treated sample clearly shows more cracks compared to 10 min
treated sample, as shown in Figure S2b,c,
respectively. Further treatment destroys the film (Figure S2d). Although the FE-SEM image of untreated 1L-MoS2 does not show any apparent structural deformation/distortion,
some distortions were observed at the nanoscopic level resolution,
as shown in the high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission
electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image in Figure 1d. These structural distortions essentially
happen at the grain boundaries, which arise from the lateral junction
of two flakes. Here, it is worth mentioning that the MOCVD technique
produces continuous polycrystalline 1L-MoS2 by laterally
connecting the neighboring flakes and eventually form a large-area
continuous film. The HADDF-STEM images that were taken within the
grain exhibited a uniform hexagonal configuration, as shown in Figure S3a,b. Moreover, the as-grown film was
a dominantly single layer; however, some negligibly small bilayer
regions were also observed (Figure S3c).

the diffraction patterns of each grain. HAADF-STEM images of N2-plasma-treated MoS2 observed at (e, f) cracked
grain boundary, (g) edge sites, and (h) S-vacancies.

The atomic-scale resolution images of N2-plasma-treated
1L-MoS2 film are depicted in Figures 1e–h and S3d–f, respectively. The high-resolution image taken at the
cracked region clearly shows the formation of new edge sites. The
edge seems to be terminated at the Mo edge, as depicted in Figure 1g. Another important
aspect of plasma treatment is the creation of more S-vacancies in
the MoS2 lattice. The HADDF-STEM image taken away from
the crack boundary revealed the formation of S-vacancies (Figures 1h and S3f), which were absent in the untreated sample.
Although it is well known that S-vacancies ubiquitously exist in CVD-grown
MoS2, the density of these intrinsic S-vacancies is not
sufficient to ensure a good HER performance. The S-vacancies should
be at least up to ∼14% for the optimized Gibbs free energy
for hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH* ≈
0).25 These edges and S-vacancies work
as active sites and thereby enhance the HER performance of MoS2.

2.2 Optical Characterization
The effect
of N2 plasma on the optical characteristics of 1L-MoS2 was investigated by micro-Raman scattering and PL spectroscopy,
as shown in Figure 2a. The wavenumber separation between the two dominant Raman modes,
namely, E2g1 and A1g of MoS2, was found to be ∼20.7 cm–1 for
the pristine sample, which is the typical Raman signature of a single-layer
MoS2. After plasma treatment, the peak positions of both
modes did not show a significant shift; however, the peak intensities
rapidly drop accompanied by peak broadening, indicating the lattice
distortion and defects generation such as cracks and S-vacancies.
A similar trend was also observed in the PL spectra. The untreated
sample shows a strong PL peak at ∼667 nm corresponding to the
radiative recombination of A-excitons across the
direct band gap at the K and K′
points in reciprocal space. This again confirms that the as-grown
film was essentially a monolayer. The PL intensity also rapidly drops
with increasing treatment time, which can be also attributed to enhanced
defects sites, created by N2 plasma (Figure 2b).24,34 Moreover, the PL intensity
mapping taken over the selected area of 20 μm2 of
the MoS2 film before and after 20 min treatment further
supports the above results (Figure S4).

treatment. (a) Raman spectra shows the evolution of
typical Raman modes, namely, E2g1 and A1g of MoS2, and (b) PL spectra as a function of treatment
time. The Raman spectra were calibrated by the Si Raman peak. All
of the spectroscopic measurements were carried out at the same position.

2.3 Chemical Compositional Analysis
The
effect of N2-plasma treatment on elemental bonding states
of MoS2 was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), as shown in Figure 3. A comparative XPS analysis of pristine and 20 min plasma-treated
MoS2 sample reveals a slight red shift in S2– 2p1/2 (163.2 eV) and S2– 2p3/2 (161.9 eV) peaks in the treated sample, which is consistent with
the previous report,35 as illustrated in Figure 3a. The shift in the
peak positions in the treated sample essentially indicates a change
in the electronic band structure. Most likely, the Fermi level has
been shifted down toward the valence band due to the formation of
S-vacancies.36 The S-vacancies might transform
the MoS2 from n- to p-type.35,37 Moreover, decrease in the S/Mo ratio from
1.93 of the as-grown MoS2 to 1.71 of the plasma-treated
MoS2 further confirmed the generation of S-vacancies by
plasma treatment. In addition, the peak located at 397.5 eV (green
fitted line in Figure 3b) clearly increased in the plasma-treated sample. This peak can
be attributed to the Mo–N bond.22,38,39 However, the quantitative analysis shows that the
Mo–N bond position can be easily confusable with the peak
position of CNx and CNx–H species, which might be formed during N2-plasma treatment of MoS2 due to the excessive availability
of carbon species in ambient environment.35 To exactly confirm that the peak at 397.5 eV indeed corresponds
to Mo–N bonding, an annealing process would be needed to completely
desorb the carbon species and quickly load to in situ XPS characterization.35 Nevertheless, it was beyond the scope of this
work, even though the N-doped MoS2 can be a practical approach
to form even more active sites at the interior of the MoS2 lattice. Overall, the XPS results suggest that N2-plasma
treatment is a feasible way to cleave the surface of MoS2 and increase the number of active sites in 1L-MoS2 for
enhancing HER activity.

and after 20 min treatment.

2.4 HER Performance
Finally, the HER
performance of N2-plasma-treated MoS2 samples
was evaluated. It is evident that the untreated MoS2 sample
exhibited relatively weak HER activities with an onset overpotential
at −460 mV vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), as shown
in the iR-corrected linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) (Figure 4a). Although the ideal MoS2 crystal has very limited active sites available for HER,
CVD- or MOCVD-grown MoS2 possesses some S-vacancies.26 These vacancies along with the grain boundaries
are indeed responsible for the limited HER activities of untreated
MoS2.40 On the other hand, the
samples treated with N2 plasma for 10–30 min showed
considerable decrease in the onset overpotential (Figure 4a). The smallest value of the
onset overpotential of −210 mV was obtained for the 20 min
treated sample. The above results can simply be understood in terms
of more active sites generated by N2-plasma treatment.
As discussed earlier, the plasma treatment induced active sites (edges
and S-vacancies) in MoS2 lattice that are beneficial for
HER performance. However, the treatment time should be carefully chosen
to acquire optimum active sites. In our case, the optimum time was
found to be 20 min. Employing plasma for a longer time involves the
risk of destroying the film. Nevertheless, the results show that N2 plasma irradiation is an effective way to engineer the active
sites in a controlled manner, and thereby improving the HER performance
of MoS2. The corresponding iR-corrected Tafel plot was
also characterized to manifest the enhancement of the HER performance
in plasma-treated MoS2 (Figure 4b). The slope of 89 mV/dec was observed for
the optimally treated sample (20 min), which is considerably smaller
than 118 mV/dec of the untreated sample. The overpotentials of the
samples of overly treated samples (>30 min) were even larger compared
to those of the as-grown MoS2 because most of the active
area in MoS2 was destroyed. This observation is also consistent
with the morphological and optical characterizations. For a comparative
analysis, the HER performance of N2-plasma-treated MoS2 grown via MOCVD and recently reported CVD methods is tabulated
in Table 1.

Moreover, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the plasma-treated MoS2 was
estimated by
the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement conducted
at −0.4 V vs RHE (Figure 4c). The 20 min treated sample clearly shows a smaller
semicircle diameter than the rest of the samples, indicating the lowest Rct (18 Ω) by fitting the corresponding
EIS spectrum using a Randles circuit model (Figure S5). For the overly treated samples (40 and 50 min), considerably
higher Rct values of 202–280 Ω
were found, respectively, which is consistent with the linear sweep
measurements shown in Figure 4a.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA)
of catalysts can
be evaluated from the value of the double-layer capacitance, CDL, which is known to be proportional to the
ECSA and the roughness factor.41−44 The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were characterized
for all of our samples in non-Faradic potential regions at various
scan rates from 10 to 70 mV/s. This is shown in Figure 4d for the optimal plasma treatment time of
20 min. The values of CDL were calculated
from CV characterizations in Figure 4e, where a 20 min treatment yielded the maximum CDL of 0.74 mF/cm2, which is 4.3 times
larger than that of the as-grown sample (0.17 mF/cm2).
Our CDL results are also consistent with
LSV scan and impedance measurement in Figure 4a,c, respectively, confirming the effect
of N2-plasma treatment on the electrochemical performance
of MoS2 samples.

Furthermore, the stability of the
HER activity was evaluateded
using the transient Chrono potentiometric study for 12 h at 1.5 mA/cm2, as shown in Figure 4f. The samples exhibited inappreciable degradation in HER
and maintained the overpotential, except those samples that were treated
for more than 30 min.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we employed
a simple N2-plasma treatment
mechanism to generate sufficient active sites in terms of S-vacancies
and edges in a large-area 1L-MoS2. This essentially allowed
exploiting the large-area 1L-MoS2 film grown via MOCVD
for efficient HER activities. The density of active sites could be
effectively controlled simply by exposing the sample to N2 plasma for various times. In our case, the sample treated for 20
min showed the best HER performance with the onset overpotential of
−210 mV vs RHE and the corresponding Tafel slope of 89 mV/dec.
Our proposed method is simple and controllable to maximize the HER
efficiency of the wafer-scale working medium, which may also be applied
to other members of the TMD family for even further improving the
HER efficiency.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of 1L-MoS2
A
large-area 1L-MoS2 film was prepared by MOCVD, as schematically
illustrated in Figure 1a. In brief, the synthesis was carried out in a sealed quartz tube
of 1 inch diameter. A SiO2/Si substrate was placed at the
center of the tube. The metal–organic compounds of molybdenum
hexacarbonyl (MHC, Mo(CO)6) and diethyl sulfide (DES, (C2H5)2S) were used as gas-phase precursors.
These precursors have a high equilibrium vapor pressure at room temperature.
Initially, the base pressure (∼1 mTorr) was created in the
chamber. The temperatures of MHC and DES holder were kept at 27 and
40 °C, respectively. The temperatures of the precursor’s
carrier-line and reaction zone were set to 50 and 500 °C, respectively.
30 sccm of Ar and 3 sccm of H2 was flowed into the reaction
chamber. The reaction pressure was set to 60 Torr. The reaction process
was started by introducing 1 sccm of DES and MHC. The reaction time
was set to 10 h. The detailed schematic description is given in Figure S1a and our previous report.29

4.2 N2-Plasma Treatment
The
as-synthesized MoS2 (2 × 3 cm2) was cut
into several pieces, and few samples were selected to study the impact
of plasma treatment as a function of treatment time (Figure 1b). The electric potential
of 20 kV was applied with 100 sccm of N2 flow to generate
plasma (Figure S1b). The distance between
the sample and the high potential tip was adjusted and the corresponding
electrical current was about 0.2 mA. For a comparative study of HER
activity, six samples were prepared with different treatment times
of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min.

4.3 Characterization
The morphologies
of the as-grown and N2-plasma-treated 1L-MoS2 samples were characterized by FE-SEM (JEOL JSM-6500F), high angle
annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM).
STEM samples were prepared without using any polymer backing layer.
Quantifoil holey carbon TEM grids were placed onto flakes on SiO2/Si substrate and a drop of isopropyl alcohol was dropped
and dried. The SiO2 layer was etched by 30% KOH solution
for 4 h and the TEM grids were detached from the substrate. Then,
TEM grids were rinsed several times in deionized (DI) water and dried
in ambient condition. STEM imaging was performed by a JEOL ARM 200F
equipped with image and probe aberration correctors operated at 80
kV. The convergence semiangle was set at ∼25 mrad. HAADF-STEM
images were acquired from 80 to 200 mrad range. Optical properties
were characterized by micro-Raman and PL spectroscopies using 473
nm excitation source under ambient conditions. The chemical composition
analysis was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Theta
Probe AR-XPS System, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

4.4 HER Measurements
The MoS2 samples on SiO2/Si were transferred to a graphite foil
that is a working electrode for studying the HER activity (Figure S1c). The films were transferred by the
wet transfer method.24,37,45 First, MoS2 (1 × 1 cm2) on SiO2/Si was syringed by 0.3 mL poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA, 5% toluene),
spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and dried at 90 °C for 30 min.
The PMMA/MoS2/SiO2/Si was then dipped in 10
mL of KOH solution (1 M) at 90 °C to etch the SiO2 layer. The PMMA/MoS2 was floated on the solution. After
several washings with DI water, the PMMA/MoS2 layer was
transferred onto the target electrode (graphite foil). Finally, the
PMMA layer was removed by 99.99% warm acetone.

The HER measurements
including linear sweep and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) were conducted in an electrochemical workstation (IviumStat,
Ivium Tech) with three electrodes including a Pt wire as the counter
electrode, an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and the MoS2/graphite foil as the working electrode (Figure S1d). For HER stability study, the graphite rod was
used as the counter electrode instead of Pt wire to avoid the Pt dissolution
and deposition on the working electrode during the HER stability experiment.46 All of the three electrodes were placed in 0.5
M H2SO4 electrolyte to observe the HER activity.
The EIS result was fitted using the equivalent circuit evaluator (Ivium
Tech) modeled with two constant-phase elements (CPEs).
