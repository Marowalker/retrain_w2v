The
water-stable material NOTT-401 was investigated for CO2 capture under humid conditions. Water adsorption properties
of NOTT-401 were studied, and their correlation with CO2 sequestration at different relative humidities (RHs) showed that
the CO2 capture increased from 1.2 wt % (anhydrous conditions)
to 3.9 wt % under 5% RH at 30 °C, representing a 3.2-fold improvement.

Introduction
Last year,
global CO2 emissions have increased up to 35.7 billion
tons, of which 90% are fuel-combustion-related emissions.1 As other porous materials, porous coordination
polymers (PCPs) have stepped up to the challenge of CO2 sequestration; they are known for their adsorption properties and
in particular for the feasibility of tuning their pore shape, size,
and adsorption enthalpies. Potential industrial applications for PCP
materials (such as the treatment of postcombustion flue gas where
5–7% of its composition is water) need to show high adsorption
CO2 capacity and water stability.2

Some representative examples of PCPs that showed water stability
are MIL-53, MIL-100, MIL-101, MIL-110, and ZIF-8.3 Water stability in PCPs relies on the metal–ligand
bond strength and steric effects around the ligand.4 Lillerud et al.5 introduced
a water-stable material entitled UiO-66, whereas Yaghi and co-workers
showed a Zr-based water-stable family of PCPs.6 Recently, Snurr, Hupp, and Farha have developed a water-stable series
of Zr-based PCPs (NU-1101 to 1105) with ultrahigh surface areas.7 One of the most common strategies to improve
the water stability of PCPs is ligand functionalization. Walton et
al.8 modified a Zr-based PCP series by
adding nonpolar groups to the ligand. Another synthetic approach to
functionalization is to decorate the PCPs with amines such as HNUST-4,9 MIL-101,10 and MOF-74/CPO-27.11

Studies on CO2 adsorption in
the presence of water molecules
were first presented by Férey et al.12,12a and later by Snurr and co-workers.12b Because H2O molecules strongly compete with CO2 for adsorption sites, the overall CO2 capture is often
decreased. However, Llewellyn and co-workers reported an exceptional
increase (5-fold) in the CO2 adsorption in MIL-100(Fe)
at 40% relative humidity (RH).13 Additionally,
Yaghi et al.6 demonstrated that the incorporation
of bridged μ3-OH groups within the pores of PCPs
increases water affinity. Hence, we hypothesized that the incorporation
of functional groups within the PCP pores (such as −OH) can
be an effective strategy to enhance the water stability of PCPs.

Thus, herein we have chosen a material entitled NOTT-40114 that shows μ2-OH functional
groups inside of the channels (see Figure 1). NOTT-401 crystallizes in the tetragonal
space group I41/amd,
and it is based on a binuclear [Sc2(μ2-OH)] building block and 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate (Figure S1). The Sc(III) center adopts an octahedral
coordination environment, constructed by two adjacent μ2-OH groups and four different 2,5-thiophenecarboxylate O-donors.
The three-dimensional NOTT-401 framework (see Figure 1) comprises channel openings of approximately
6.3 Å (van der Waals radii).14

Experimental Section
Synthesis of NOTT-401 was carried out
as previously reported elsewhere.14 The
synthesized product was first analyzed using
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). PXRD patterns were collected using
a Bruker AXD D8 Advance diffractometer under ambient conditions, operated
at 160 W (40 kV and 40 mA) for Cu Kα1 (λ =
1.5406 Å). Thermal gravimetric analyses were carried out on a
Q500HR analyzer (TA Instruments) under an N2 atmosphere
at a scan rate of 2 °C min–1. Nitrogen (N2) adsorption isotherms were performed using a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 sorptometer (volumetric technique). On the basis of the
N2 adsorption data, it was possible to estimate the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area (0.01 < P/P0 < 0.04). Static CO2 adsorption isotherms,
from 0 to 15 bar at 30 °C, were obtained on a BELSORP-HP analyzer.
CO2 experiments under dynamic and isothermal (30 °C)
conditions were carried out using a humidity-controlled thermobalance
(TA Instruments, model Q5000SA) by varying the RH.

Kinetic CO2 Capture
Experiments
Kinetic
CO2 uptake experiments were carried out using a thermobalance
(Q500 HR, TA Instruments). Before measurements, NOTT-401 samples were
activated at 180 °C for 1 h inside of the thermobalance under
a constant N2 flow. After the activation, the samples were
cooled down to 30 °C, and then CO2 uptake experiments
were performed under a constant CO2 flow of 60 mL min–1. Then, a series of fixed humidity-controlled experiments were
carried out using the thermobalance (Q5000SA, TA Instruments). As
mentioned earlier, the samples were activated before each experiment
(180 °C for 1 h under a N2 flow). Then, the kinetic
uptake experiments were carried out at 30 °C, under a CO2 flow of 60 mL min–1 and a fixed RH (see Scheme S1).

Water Adsorption Experiments
Isotherms were recorded
using a DVS Advantage 1 instrument (Surface Measurement Systems) by
a dynamic method, with air as the carrier gas (mass sensitivity: 0.1
μg, RH accuracy: 0.5% RH, and vapor pressure accuracy: 0.7% P/P0). Before measurements,
samples were activated at 180 °C for 2 h under an N2 flow. The water uptake in weight percentage (wt %) units was calculated
as [(adsorbed amount of water)/(amount of adsorbent) × 100],
consistent with established procedures.

Results and Discussion
After the synthesis of NOTT-401, free-solvent molecules remain
in the pores. Thus, to gain accessibility to the pores upon activation
(heating under vacuum), these molecules were exchanged for acetone.
The NOTT-401 stability was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) (see Figure S2) and bulk PXRD experiments
(see Figure S3) before and after the activation
process. Both PXRD experiments showed retention of the structural
integrity of NOTT-401. Nitrogen (N2) adsorption isotherms
were performed for the activated NOTT-401 samples (180 °C and
10–5 bar for 2 h), and with this information, a
BET surface area of 1504 m2 g–1 and a
pore volume of 0.66 cm3 g–1 were calculated
in the range of 0.01 < P/P0 < 0.04. Water adsorption isotherms were carried out on
the activated NOTT-401 samples (180 °C for 2 h under an N2 flow) at 20 and 30 °C (see Experimental
Section). Figure 2 shows the water (H2O) adsorption isotherm of NOTT-401
at 30 oC. This adsorption isotherm exhibits an uptake of
H2O that gradually increases as the pressure increases
up to approximately %P/P0 = 30. Then, a relatively fast increase in the adsorbed amount of
H2O was observed from %P/P0 = 30 to 50. At the end of the experiment, from %P/P0 = 50 to 90, a constant
lineal H2O uptake was observed, with a maximum water uptake
of approximately 10.2 wt %. The overall H2O isotherm shape
for NOTT-401 is characteristic of a functionalized PCP material with
hydroxyl groups,6 and from %P/P0 = 0 to 50, a marked hysteresis loop
was observed with a sheer drop in the desorption phase (Figure 2, open circles). The diameter
of the pores in NOTT-401 is approximately 6.3 Å,14 which is considerably larger than the kinetic diameter
of H2O (∼2.7 Å). Hence, the characteristic
“kinetic trap” description cannot be used for the hysteresis
loop.15 In this case, this hysteresis can
be attributed to the relatively strong host–guest interactions
that provide an enhanced water affinity to NOTT-401. We then propose
that these interactions are the result of H2O molecules
forming hydrogen bonds with the μ2-OH functional
groups in the inner surface of the NOTT-401 pores, as previously reported.16

Figure 2 Water adsorption isotherm of NOTT-401 at 30 °C. Solid
circles
correspond to adsorption, and open circles correspond to desorption.

We previously reported on the
water adsorption properties of NOTT-400,19d which is not isostructural to NOTT-401 but
is constructed with the same binuclear [Sc2(μ2-OH)] building block. Interestingly, the water adsorption
isotherm of NOTT-400 is very different than that exhibited by NOTT-401.
Although these two materials share the same hydrophilic μ2-OH functional group, NOTT-400 is considerably more hydrophobic
than NOTT-401. Because NOTT-400 is
constructed with a more hydrophobic ligand (H4BPTC = biphenyl-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic
acid) than 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid (NOTT-401), at low %P/P0, the water uptake for NOTT-400
is considerably lower than that for NOTT-401.19d Thus, we may conclude that the nature of the ligand that
conforms a PCP controls the overall water adsorption process even
though the same hydrophilic functional group (μ2-OH)
is present.

A second H2O adsorption isotherm (at
20 °C) was
performed to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption (enthalpy)
for water (see Figure S4). This was calculated
by fitting the two adsorption isotherms (20 and 30 °C) to the
Clausius–Clapeyron equation (see Supporting Information). The enthalpy value was estimated to be 60.7 kJ
mol–1, which is a characteristic value for PCPs,4a and the magnitude represents a very strong hydrogen
bond between water and the μ2-OH functional groups
inside of the NOTT-401 channels.

Later, dynamic and isothermal
NOTT-401 CO2 capture experiments
were carried out. The kinetic CO2 uptake experiment at
30 °C is presented in Figure 3. Under anhydrous conditions and at 30 °C, the
CO2 uptake promptly reached its maximum just after 7 min;
it was estimated to be 1.2 wt % and remained stable through the rest
of the experiment (60 min). Additionally, CO2 sorption
experiments were performed on NOTT-401 under static and isothermal
conditions of 30 °C and 1 bar (see Figure S5). The total CO2 uptake was 11.3 wt %, which is
one order of magnitude higher than that obtained under dynamic conditions
(1.2 wt %). This result is
reasonable because under static conditions, the stabilization time
for each measurement (the gradual increase in the CO2 pressure)
is much longer than that under dynamic conditions where there is a
rapid flow of CO2 gas (60 mL min–1),
and therefore the CO2 uptake is also higher. In addition,
the pretreatment of the samples is completely different in each experiment.
Under dynamic conditions, the activation is generated by heating at
180 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen flow. When this activation
is finished, the temperature is cooled down to 30 °C (under N2) and then the samples were subjected to a flow of CO2. This means that the sample is filled with N2 molecules, which are eventually displaced
by CO2 molecules. On the other hand, in a static CO2 adsorption experiment, the sample is activated under vacuum
(10–3 bar) at 180 °C for 1 h, providing a completely
empty material. Thus, when “small” amounts of CO2 enter into the pores of NOTT-401, there is nothing to displace
(N2 molecules), and therefore the total uptake is expected
to be much higher than under dynamic conditions, as previously reported.19,19e Nevertheless, the central target of this study is to come closer
to a more lifelike CO2 capture state (constant CO2 flow) and analyze the effect of small amounts of water on the overall
CO2 capture.

Figure 3 Kinetic CO2 uptake experiment performed
under anhydrous
conditions of 30 °C with a 60 mL min–1 CO2 flow.

Henry’s law applies
in adsorbate–adsorbent systems
where the adsorbate is too dilute that there is neither competition
for adsorption sites nor interaction between adsorbate molecules.17,17a The experimental CO2 adsorption isotherm of NOTT-401
(at 30 °C) obeys this law, suggesting the ideal gas behavior
of CO2 within the pores (see Figure S6). This is possible when the thermal energy of the CO2 molecules exceeds the potential energies of the dispersive
and the quadrupole interactions with the pore surface. The absence
of load centers with intensive electric fields in the framework as
well as the proximity between the adsorption experiment (30 °C)
and the adsorbate critical temperatures17b (31 °C) can explain such ideal behavior.

The behavior
of the H2O adsorption isotherm is much
more complex. The large hysteresis loop at low pressure (Figure 2) suggests the existence
of specific adsorption sites with strong interactions. NOTT-401 includes
16 μ2-OH groups per unit cell.14 These sites retain 65% of the limit capacity of the material.
The strong dipolar interaction between them explains the hysteresis
loop at low pressure. The behavior of NOTT-401 changes to being more
hydrophobic after H2O molecules entirely cover the μ2-OH functional groups, generating the first adsorption domain
(see Figure S7). Apparently, 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate
ligands are involved in the second adsorption domain. The hydrophobic
nature of these building units and their high electron densities can
open the possibility of retaining molecules with a high electron density
which favor dispersive interactions.

Then, kinetic CO2 isotherm experiments at 30 °C
and under different RHs (5, 20, and 30% RH) were carried out. These
RHs were selected according to the information obtained from the water
adsorption isotherm (see Figure 2): these three RHs are in the low uptake region where
the H2O uptake slowly increases with increasing pressure.

First, for the fixed RH experiments, a NOTT-401 solvent-exchanged
sample was activated at 180 °C for 1 h under a flow of N2 gas (see Scheme S1). Then the
sample was cooled down to 30 °C. When this temperature was stable,
the RH was fixed at 5% RH, and after reaching equilibrium, the sample
was exposed to a constant CO2 flow of 60 mL min–1 (see Figure 4A). Figure 4A shows a constant
uptake of water, which begins immediately at 0 min. Only after 20
min did the water uptake become steady. Interestingly,
on the other hand, the stabilization time for the CO2 uptake
experiment under anhydrous conditions is reached in only one-third
of this time, that is, 7 min (see Figure 3). This difference can be attributed to the
diffusion coefficients; because the coefficient of the water molecule
is smaller than that of CO2, more time is required for
water (vapor adsorption) to reach stability than for CO2 (gas adsorption) in microporous materials.18 After the H2O uptake reached stability, the adsorption
remained constant (plateau) from 20 to 53 min (1.0 wt %, in accordance
with the H2O adsorption isotherm; 1.1 wt %). Afterwards,
the sample was exposed to a CO2 flow (60 mL min–1), and an abrupt weight increment was observed which stabilized at
around 90 min (see Figure 4A). Our hypothesis is that the amount of adsorbed H2O is unchanged after the dosing of H2O/CO2 mixed
gas as we previously reported.19 In the
final part of the experiment, from 90 to 120 min , the maximum amount
of CO2 captured was 3.9 wt % (contemplating
the 1.0 wt % corresponding to the water uptake). Additionally, after
this CO2 capture experiment at 5% RH, a PXRD experiment
was carried out to evaluate the retention of the crystallinity of
NOTT-401, which can lead to the assessment of the sorbent regeneration.
As expected (because NOTT-401 is a water-stable PCP), the material
retained its crystallinity (Figure S8),
suggesting that the regeneration of the material after it has been
exposed to water (RH) is possible.

Figure 4 Kinetic CO2 uptake experiments
performed at 30 °C
and a series of relative humidities: (A) 5, (B) 20, and (C) 30% RH;
H2O (blue line) and H2O + CO2 (red
line).

Hence, in the presence of 5% RH,
the CO2 capture was
approximately 3.2-fold augmented (from 1.2 wt % to 3.9 wt %) when
compared with anhydrous conditions. This improvement in the CO2 uptake on account of H2O can be rationalized by
the CO2 confinement effects produced by the water molecules.20

Nevertheless, it is important to consider
the scenario (as a source
of error) where CO2 increases the H2O uptake.
For instance, in the bulk phase, it is very well known that CO2 and H2O participate in hydration reactions to
form unstable carbonic acid and eventually dissociate into more stable
ions (CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ HCO3– + H+).21,21a,21b The formation
of CO2 hydrate involves a high critical pressure (from
20 to 200 bar) and subambient temperatures (273–285 K).21c Additionally, CO2 solubility in
H2O is very low (0.0286 mol/kg of water) at 1 bar and 303.15
K.21d However, the adsorption of the binary
mixture (CO2 and H2O) is known to be a very
nonideal system where highly complex interactions between these two
species and a pore surface take place.21e−21g Thus, the pore-surface
chemistry and the pore dimensions of the adsorbent (NOTT-401) play
fundamental roles in modifying the loading of CO2 on the
adsorbed water layers at low CO2 partial pressures (e.g.,
1 bar), and a relatively small error could be associated that the
CO2 may also augment the water uptake. This negligible
error can be attributed to a cooperative effect of the adsorption
of CO2 and the formation of its water complexes inside
of the pores, augmenting the adsorbed water in a small portion.21h

On a more detailed inspection, CO2 can be found to interact
with field gradients generated by H2O molecules. Certainly,
the electron density from the oxygen atoms (H2O molecules)
favors their interaction with the dispersive 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate
building units in NOTT-401 (see Figure S9), and because H2O has a smaller kinetic diameter (2.6
Å) than that of CO2 (3.3 Å), this molecule diffuses
easily through the narrow channels in NOTT-401 (6.3 Å). The Henry
constants estimated from the CO2 and H2O adsorption
isotherms are 0.003213 ± 0.000002 and 0.52 ± 0.03 mmol (g
mmHg)−1, respectively, at 30 °C (see Figures S6 and S11). Thus, NOTT-401 shows a selectivity
for water in a H2O(v)–CO2(v) mixture
of 162 ± 9. This high selectivity to water prevents CO2 from being absorbed preferentially in any adsorption domain. However,
the high water selectivity allows the creation of stable domains in
NOTT-401, which favor the CO2 retention.

Later, kinetic
CO2 uptake experiments were carried out
on an activated NOTT-401 sample at 30 °C, with a modified relative
humidity of 20% RH (see Figure 4B). Figure 4B exhibits a regular H2O weight increment that begins
at the start of the experiment (0 min) and at around 50 min becomes
steady. From 50 to 80 min, the H2O adsorption remained
constant, with an uptake of approximately 2.9 wt %, showing good agreement
with the 3.0 wt % in the H2O adsorption isotherm (see Figure 2). Then, a CO2 flow was initiated, after which a sharp uptake was recorded
(see Figure 4B). After
achieving stability (at around 100 min), the final CO2 uptake
was 1.9 wt %. Therefore, the CO2 capture was approximately
1.6-fold augmented (taking anhydrous conditions as reference). Finally,
another set of kinetic CO2 uptake experiments were performed
on a NOTT-401 activated sample at 30 °C and 30% RH (see Figure 4C). The stabilization
time was achieved after 30 min (see Figure 4C), with a H2O uptake of ∼4.5
wt % (at 30% RH, the water uptake was 4.2 wt %, see Figure 2). Then, at approximately 50
min, the CO2 flow was initiated and the weight increase
was very small, reaching a total CO2 capture of only 0.4
wt %. This result means that at 30% RH, the sample is practically
saturated with H2O and that it is not possible to capture
CO2 (see Figure 4C).

As we mentioned before, NOTT-401 shows a pore diameter
of 6.3 Å,14 which corresponds to the
microporous regime.
In contrast, Llewellyn and co-workers13 reported an outstanding result of a 5-fold increase in CO2 uptake on a mesoporous material (MIL-100(Fe)). The MIL-100(Fe) structure
consists of two types of cages with access windows of approximately
25 and 29 Å,13 which are considerably
larger than the micropores exhibited by NOTT-401. Therefore, at 30%
RH, the saturation with H2O molecules of these micropores,
in NOTT-401, was almost complete, and consequently, the incorporation
of CO2 molecules into the micropores was not viable. This
rationalization is based on experimental evidence obtained from another
microporous material previously reported by us.19d Additionally, this experimental evidence is supported by
Medders and Paesani22 who carried out an
in silico infrared spectroscopy study of the behavior of H2O molecules confined in a microporous coordination polymer entitled
MIL-53(Cr). The MIL-53(Cr) structure is based on a series of one-dimensional
chains conformed of
CrO4(μ2-OH) octahedra sharing its corners,
linked by 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) ligands.23 Then, Paesani showed22 two different
scenarios where, depending on the amount of H2O adsorbed
in the material, the location of water molecules inside of the channels
of MIL-53(Cr) is rather different.

In the first case, when there
is low water loading in the pore,
the H2O molecules interact strongly with the pore walls,
through the formation of hydrogen bonds with the μ2-OH functional groups, and this produces a very ordered and homogeneous
organization of the H2O molecules inside of the pore channels.
This was also corroborated by Haigis16 who
demonstrated by molecular dynamics (MD) that at low water loadings,
the water molecules and the hydroxo functional groups (μ2-OH) within the pore form very stable hydrogen bonds in MIL-53(Cr).
Furthermore, using GCMC simulations on MIL-53(Cr), Maurin et al.24 showed that at low water loadings, these molecules
are uniformly distributed at the inner surface of the material.

In the second case, at higher water loadings, intermolecular interactions
between the H2O molecules become considerably stronger,
and, conversely to the first case, the arrangement of water molecules
is neither homogeneous nor ordered inside of the material. In other
words, at low H2O loadings, the channels of MIL-53(Cr)
present a very regular and well-ordered template for packing water
molecules more regularly and efficiently, and therefore these H2O molecules enhance the total CO2 uptake by providing
a hydrogen bond to the CO2 molecules.

Conclusions
Summarizing,
the water-stable NOTT-401 showed interesting water
adsorption properties that provided us a guideline to evaluate the
amount of water needed for a better CO2 sequestration.
Thus, finding the most suitable partial saturation of H2O molecules (percentage of RH) into the micropores of NOTT-401 is
fundamental to improving the CO2 uptake. As previously
described by Paesani,22 Haigis,16 and Maurin,24 via
computational calculations, at low water loadings (in microporous
materials that show bridging hydroxo functional groups), these H2O molecules can be accommodated very efficiently by taking
advantage of the relatively strong hydrogen bond with the μ2-OH functional group. Consequently, these H2O molecules
enhance the total CO2 uptake by providing a hydrogen bond
to the CO2 molecules, as we have experimentally demonstrated.
Thus, our experimental evidence corroborates that the CO2 confinement effects induced by H2O20 can take place inside of the NOTT-401 micropores, enhancing
the total CO2 uptake. After testing different RH conditions
(5, 20, and 30% RH), we found that the maximum CO2 capture
was achieved at the lowest RH (5% RH), with a total amount of CO2 capture of roughly 3.9 wt %. Remarkably, the CO2 capture under humid conditions presents a 3.2-fold increase when
compared with that under anhydrous conditions (1.2 wt %).
