Anisotropic
two-dimensional materials with direction-dependent mechanical and
optical properties have attracted significant attention in recent
years. In this work, based on density functional theory calculations,
unexpected elastic anisotropy and optical isotropy in van der Waals
(vdW) heterostructures have been theoretically proposed by assembling
the well-known anisotropic black phosphorene (BP) and transition-metal
trisulfides MS3 (M = Ti, Hf) together. It is interesting
to see that the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures show anisotropic
flexibility in different directions according to the elastic constants,
Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio. We have further
unraveled their physical origin of the type-II band structure nature
with their conduction band minimum and valence band maximum separated
in different layers. In particular, our results on the optical response
functions including the excitonic effects of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures suggest their unexpected optical isotropies
together with the enhancements of the solar energy conversion efficiency.

1 Introduction
Since the successful
synthesis of graphene, an artificial two-dimensional (2D) atomically
thin honeycomb carbon allotrope,1 the family
of 2D materials has been burgeoning to hundreds of members in the
past decade.2−11 Among them,
low-symmetry 2D materials such as black phosphorene (BP),12−14 tellurene,15−17 monochalcogenides,18−22 dichalcogenides,23−25 and trichalcogenides26−28 have attracted global attention because of their
unique asymmetric 2D crystal structures together with their intraplane
mechanical, electrical, and optical anisotropies.23,29 For
instance, the angle-dependent optical conductivity of BP may allow
the construction of plasmonic devices where the surface plasmon polariton
frequency will have a strong directional dependence on the wave vector.30 Strong anisotropy quasi-one-dimensional charge
density wave states have been observed in TiS3, a typical
transition-metal trisulfide.31 It is interesting
to note that very different transport properties can be achieved in
the field-effect transistors made from the same anisotropic material
as well.32 Nevertheless, the small species
and amount of 2D systems with asymmetric crystal structures limit
the effective application of their anisotropic properties.33,34 Therefore, the development and investigation of novel anisotropic
2D materials is a never-ending task and of considerable interest and
importance.

Combing two different 2D materials together via
the van der Waals (vdW) interaction to obtain the so-called vdW heterostructure
is an effective way to extend the number of 2D material family.35−38 It
is worth noting that the formation of a vdW heterostructure can not
only combine the advantages of two 2D affiliations together but also
introduce unexpected novel properties and phenomena.39−42 For
instance, flexible and semitransparent devices have been fabricated
by combining different 2D semiconductor materials with fine-tuning
of the emission spectra and enhancing electroluminescence.43 By tuning the interfacial distance or applying
an external electric filed, the band alignment between graphene and
GaSe can be effectively modulated in the GaSe/graphene vdW heterostructure.44−46 ZrS3 and HfS3 monolayers can form a stable type-II vdW heterostructure and show
high solar power conversion efficiency up to 18%.47 Superior electrical conductivity, omnidirectional flexibility,
and high Li capacity can be achieved at the same time in the BP–TiC2 vdW heterostructure.48 It is noted
that the single-layer structures of BP and MX3 (X = Ti,
Hf) sharing the same asymmetric orthogonal 2D crystal structure with
reasonable lattice mismatch, which are good counterparts for establishing
high-quality heterostructures.27,49 Hence, it is very interesting
to raise the question that whether BP and MX3 monolayers
can form vdW heterostructures and show attractive novel physical and
chemical properties.50 Therefore, in this
work, BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures were theoretically explored
based on advanced vdW-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations
in order to unravel their interesting mechanical properties, electronic
structures, and optical properties. The present results reveal unexpected
elastic anisotropy and optical isotropy in the BP/MS3 vdW
heterostructures. We assume that these remarkable 2D materials will
find their applications in nanoscaled flexible optical and photoelectrical
devices.

2 Results and
Discussions
BP, TiS3, and HfS3 monolayers
share a similar orthogonal 2D lattice, and the corresponding structure
sketches are illustrated in Figure 1a,b. As listed in Table 1, the optB88-vdW-optimized 2D lattice parameters of
BP, TiS3, and HfS3 are a(BP)
= 4.506 Å, b(BP) = 3.304 Å; a(TiS3) = 4.974 Å, b(TiS3) = 3.384 Å; and a(HfS3) = 5.094
Å, b(HfS3) = 3.576 Å, respectively,
all of which are in excellent agreement with the previous literature.26,27 Herein, the lattice mismatches between TiS3 (HfS3) and BP monolayers are Δa = 10.4%
and Δb = 2.4% (Δa =
13.0%, Δb = 8.2%), which are larger than the
well-known vdW heterostructures.51,52 However, because
the BP monolayer can sustain very large tensile strain and retain
good lattice stability,49,53 the construction of
a BP–TiS3 (BP–HfS3) heterostructure
is still expected. As there are many possible structural configurations
between two 2D orthogonal lattices, a global total energy minimum
search by combining the TiS3 (HfS3) and BP monolayers
together is necessary. We first placed the original TiS3 (HfS3) and BP monolayers together in the same 2D orthogonal
lattice and then we shifted the BP monolayer along the directions
of lattice a and b independently
by the step size of 0.1. After all, we have achieved a total of 100
stacking configurations for the BP–TiS3 (BP–HfS3) heterostructure. Herein, all the configurations were under
full structural optimization with convergence criteria in terms of
both energy and force. Figure 1c,d represents the cohesive energy mapping and the most energy
favorable stacking configurations for the BP–TiS3 and BP–HfS3 heterostructures, respectively, after
structural optimization. It is interesting to show that BP–TiS3 and BP–HfS3 heterostructures show a very
different cohesive energy mapping feature and stable stacking configuration.
The optB88-vdW-optimized 2D lattice parameters of BP–TiS3 and BP–HfS3 heterostructures with the most
energy favorable stacking configuration are a(BP–TiS3) = 4.885 Å, b(BP–TiS3) = 3.340 Å, and a(BP–HfS3) = 4.996 Å, b(BP–HfS3) =
3.464 Å, respectively. We found that the BP monolayers sustain
tensile strains in the heterostructures. On the contrary, the TiS3 and HfS3 monolayers withstand compression strains
in the heterostructures. In addition, it is worth noting that the
deformation of BP is much larger than that of TiS3 and
HfS3 in the heterostructure, which could enhance the stability
of the heterostructure due to the good tensile flexibility of BP.49,53 Furthermore, the binding energy between BP and TiS3 (HfS3) monolayers in the heterostructures is calculated to be 24.44
(22.46) meV/Å2, which is close to the typical vdW
binding energy of around 20 meV/Å2 by the advanced
DFT calculations.38 Hence, the BP–TiS3 (BP–HfS3) heterostructures belong to the
novel growing family of vdW heterostructures.54 The calculated P–P and M–S bond length and the corresponding
changes from the monolayers to heterostructures of the BP–TiS3 (BP–HfS3) vdW heterostructure with the
most stable stacking configuration are also listed in Table 1. For both cases, the P–P
bond length is larger than that in the BP monolayer with positive
bond length change values, whereas the M–S bond length is smaller
than that in the MS3 monolayer with negative bond length
change values, which represent the results that the BP monolayers
sustain tensile strain but the MS3 monolayers withstand
compression strain in the heterostructures. It is worth noting that
all the bond length changes are smaller than 0.06 Å, showing
the very small structure rearrangement and good structure stability
of the monolayers in the vdW heterostructures.

The elastic constants
were calculated by a step-by-step stress–strain method55,56 to explore the mechanical stability and biaxial/omnidirectional
stretchability of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures. For
the 2D orthogonal system, there are only four independent elastic
constants, C11, C22, C12, and C44, as summarized in Table 2. The elastic coefficient matrix can be represented
as 1  

Table 2 Estimated Elastic Constants C11, C22, C12, and C44 (N/m)
for the BP and MS3 Monolayers and the BP/MS3 Heterostructures
system	C11	C22	C12	C44	
BP	28.4	115.9	23.3	30.7	
TiS3	93.4	137.3	14.1	23.6	
HfS3	89.0	125.3	11.3	23.3	
BP–TiS3	164.6	264.5	34.1	48.7	
BP–HfS3	145.4	200.9	19.1	38.9	
Herein, the elastic
constants C11 and C22 describe the response stiffness of the 2D crystal when applied
uniaxial tensile strains along the x and y direction, respectively. The elastic constant C12 implies the ability of the material to resist
biaxial tensile strain. The elastic constant C44 expresses the deformation resistance of the in-plane shear
strain. For all the cases, the calculated elastic constants satisfy
the so-called Born’s mechanical stability criteria, C11, C22, C44 > 0 and Δ = C11C22 – C122 > 0, indicating that all the monolayers
and vdW heterostructures are mechanically stable. From Table 2, three general roles can be
concluded for the 2D monolayers and vdW heterostructures herein: first,
the strong mechanical anisotropic behaviors can be seen from the elastic
constants table. The calculated elastic constants C22 of both the monolayers and vdW heterostructures are
significantly larger than that of C11,
indicating that all these 2D materials are stiffer against strain
in the zigzag (y) direction than in the armchair
(x) direction. Second, the MS3 monolayers
present higher rigidity than the BP monolayer with larger elastic
constants. Third, the in-plane elastic constants of vdW heterostructures
are larger than those of the corresponding monolayers, which means
that the 2D monolayers will strain more than the vdW heterostructures
under the same applied force. Herein, under strain or deformation,
the vdW heterostructures with greater elastic constant or elastic
modulus can act as the scaffold material or substrate material, where
the interlayer vdW interaction can be employed to introduce a driving
force to deform the 2D monolayers with smaller elastic stiffness values.

In order to get a further understanding of the mechanical properties
of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures, we calculated Young’s
modulus E(θ) and Poisson’s ν(θ)
ratio along the arbitrary in-plane direction θ (θ identifies
the angle relative to the armchair direction) from the elastic constants
according to the following equations: 2   3  where Δ = C11C22 – C122, c = cos θ, and s = sin
θ. The corresponding polar diagrams are presented in Figure 2. For the BP monolayer,
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio along the y direction are about 3–4 times larger than those
along the x direction. It is notable that the small
negative Poisson’s ratio around 45° for the BP monolayer
well represents the previous theoretical57 and experimental results.58 For the MS3 monolayers, Young’s modulus along the y direction is about 2 times larger than those along the x direction. In addition, Poisson’s ratio around 45° is
about 3–4 times larger than those along the axial directions.
Anyway, all the monolayers show strong anisotropic mechanical properties
according to the plots of Young’s moduli and Poisson’s
ratios. Interestingly, although the plots of BP and MS3 monolayers show very different patterns, Young’s moduli and
Poisson’s ratio plots of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures
follow the feature of MS3 monolayers very well. It is because
that the rigidity of the MS3 monolayers is stronger than
that of the BP monolayer. Anyway, compared with Young’s moduli
of typical 2D flexible materials, such as graphene (342.2 N/m)59,60 and BN (275.8 N/m),60,61 the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures
show anisotropic flexibility in different directions.

the extension direction with respect to the armchair direction.

For the
better understanding of the electronic structures of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures, we started from the initial screening
of the band structure of the monolayers. The calculated band structure
of BP and MS3 monolayers using the HSE06 hybrid functional
based on the optB86-vdW wave functions are illustrated in Figure S1. The results indicate that the BP and
TiS3 monolayers are direct gap semiconductors, where both
conduction band minimum (CBM) and valance band maximum (VBM) locate
at the Γ point of the first Brillouin zone, whereas the HfS3 monolayer is an indirect gap semiconductor, where CBM locates
at the Γ point and VBM locates between the Γ and K high-symmetry points. As is concluded in Table 3, the calculated band gaps using
HSE06 hybrid functional calculations for BP, TiS3, and
HfS3 monolayers are 1.41, 1.19, and 2.10 eV, respectively.
All the electronic structure results agree well with previously published
works.26,27,62,63 It is interesting to note that both the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures display direct band gap nature according
to their HSE06 band structure plots in Figure 3. Both VBM and CBM of the two vdW heterostructures
are located at the Γ point of the first Brillouin zone. The
HSE06-predicted band gap values for BP–TiS3 and
BP–HfS3 vdW heterostructures are 0.89 and 1.00 eV,
respectively, which are also listed in Table 3. Further investigations on the band decomposition
confirmed that the VBM of both the heterostructures is contributed
by P atoms and CBM of BP–TiS3(BP–HfS3) vdW heterostructure is contributed by Ti(Hf) atoms. To provide
vividly pictures for the better understanding of the role of the constituent
layers in the vdW heterostructures, we have further illustrated the
DFT wave functions for VBM and CBM in the real space in Figure 3 as well. As can be seen, the
VBM of both heterostructures is occupied by the P 3p electrons, whereas
the CBM of the BP–TiS3 vdW heterostructure is originated
from the Ti 3d electrons, and the CBM of the BP–HfS3 vdW heterostructure is originated from the Hf 5d electrons. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures
are typical type-II vdW heterostructures where the CBM and VBM are
localized in different monolayers of the heterostructures. It is worth
noting that type-II heterostructures are highly desirable optical
materials, where the photogenerated electrons and holes can be spatially
separated from each other to different layers.37 Such a phenomenon may efficiently reduce the electron–hole
recombination probability and facilitate the efficiency for light
detection and harvesting.64

To understand
how the excitation state and quantum confinement work on the optical
properties, the optical responses were explored based on the real
and imaginary parts of the time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF)
dielectric functions in Figure S2. TDHF
simulations have been proved to provide a more accurate optical response
with energy-distinguished peaks.65 On the
basis of the dielectric functions in Figure S2a–c, the optical absorption coefficients of the BP, TiS3,
and HfS3 monolayers are presented in Figure 4a–c, respectively. It is obvious that
all the monolayers show very strong optical anisotropy features. For
the BP monolayer, the optical absorption along the xx direction is much stronger than the yy direction
in the infrared and visible light range. In the ultraviolet range,
the yy direction optical absorption peaks are higher
than the xx direction. However, TiS3 and
HfS3 monolayers show very opposite tendencies: the optical
absorption along the xx direction is much weaker
than the yy direction in the infrared and visible
light range. In the ultraviolet range, the optical absorption properties
are more or less isotropic. To achieve a quantitative understanding
of the optical anisotropy features of the monolayers, we have integrated
the optical absorption coefficients in the visible light range of
400–760 nm. The visible light absorption anisotropy factor A can be defined as A = Sxx/Syy, where Sxx and Syy are the area of the optical
absorption coefficients in the visible light range along the xx and yy direction, respectively. For
a 2D material, an A value of 1 denotes the optical
isotropy, and any value that deviates from 1 represents the optical
anisotropy. The calculated visible light absorption anisotropy factor A of the monolayers is also listed in Table 3. We observed that the BP, TiS3, and HfS3 monolayers possess strong optical anisotropy
with A = 5.05, 0.37, and 0.21, respectively. We have
further introduced the methods by Shi and Kioupakis66 to obtain the sunlight energy conversion efficiency P to lowest energy excitons along different directions.67 As the calculated results summarized in Table 3, the sunlight energy
conversion efficiencies P of BP, TiS3,
and HfS3 monolayers along the xx direction
are 0.09, 0.07, and 0.03%, respectively, which are 0.02, 0.21, and
0.09% along the yy direction, respectively. The different
energy conversion efficiencies along diffractions indicate strong
optical anisotropy of the monolayers as well.

and (e) BP–HfS3 heterostructure obtained using TDHF@HSE06
calculations.

We have further
illustrated the optical absorption coefficients of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures in Figure 4d,e according to the TDHF dielectric functions in Figure S2d,e. It is obvious that the optical
absorption of the vdW heterostructures is not simply added by that
of the monolayers. Interestingly, the formation of the vdW heterostructures
leads to a spectral blue shift along the xx direction
and a spectral red shift along the yy direction.
As a result, the optical absorption curves are homogenized in different
directions. Especially in the visible light range, the difference
of the optical absorption of the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures
along the xx direction and yy direction
is much less than that of the monolayers. For quantitative understanding
of the optical anisotropy features of the heterostructures, we have
shown the visible light absorption anisotropy factor A and the sunlight energy conversion efficiency P in Table 3 as well.
We have got the visible light absorption anisotropy factor A values of 1.15 and 1.57 for the BP–TiS3 and BP–HfS3 vdW heterostructures, respectively,
which show very high isotropic features. The sunlight energy conversion
efficiencies P of the BP–TiS3 and
BP–HfS3 vdW heterostructures along the xx direction are 0.32 and 0.47%, respectively, which are 0.19 and 0.14%
along the yy direction, respectively. We found that
the formation of the vdW heterostructures not only leads to optical
isotropy but also enhances the solar light energy conversion efficiencies.

3 Conclusions
In
summary, based on DFT calculations, we have systematically studied
the mechanical properties, electronic structures, and optical properties
of BP, TiS3, and HfS3 monolayers together with
the corresponding heterostructures. The most energetic favorable stacking
configurations of the BP–TiS3 and BP–HfS3 heterostructures have been determined by global total energy
minimum searching. We have found that the BP–TiS3 and BP–HfS3 heterostructures belong to typical
vdW heterostructures but show very different cohesive energy mapping
features and stable stacking configurations. The elastic constants
and mechanical property analyses indicate that the BP/MS3 vdW heterostructures show anisotropic flexibility in different directions.
However, further optical properties guarantee their high isotropic
visible light absorption features. Our findings will provide valuable
insights into the exploration of these remarkable elastic anisotropic
and optic isotropic 2D materials and vdW heterostructures and shed
light on their applications in flexible optical and photoelectrical
devices.

4 Computational
Details
Our DFT calculations of the heterostructures were
performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)68 in conjunction with the projector-augmented
wave69 generalized gradient approximations70 of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof71 pseudopotentials. The optB88-vdW functional72 was used for all calculations to enhance the
description of the vdW interactions.73 The
valence electron configurations for, P, S, Ti, and Hf were 3s23p3, 3s23p4, 3d34s1, and 5d26s2, respectively. We
introduced at least 20 Å thick vacuum in the z-axis direction in order to prevent the interaction between periodic
images.51 The automatically generated k-point set of 14 × 20 × 1 with the Γ symmetry
was used for self-consistent calculations. The relaxation convergence
for ions and electrons were 1 × 10–5 and 1
× 10–6 eV, respectively, which were achieved
with the cutoff energy of 600 eV. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06) hybrid functional74 was applied
to better describe the band gaps and dielectric functions. To obtain
accurate optical dielectric functions comparable with experimental
results,37,75 we employed the TDHF calculations76 based on HSE06 wave functions by including the
excitonic effects. The crystal structures and isosurfaces were visualized
using the VESTA package.77
