Metal oxides as anode
materials for lithium storage suffer from
poor cycling stability due to their conversion mechanisms. Here, we
report an efficient biomimetic method to fabricate a conformal coating
of conductive polymer on ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles,
which shows outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material
for lithium storage. Polydopamine (PDA) film, a bionic ionic permeable
film, was successfully coated on the surfaces of ZnFe2O4 particles by the self-polymerization of dopamine in the presence
of an alkaline buffer solution. The thickness of PDA coating layer
was tunable by controlling the reaction time, and the obtained ZnFe2O4/PDA sample with 8 nm coating layer exhibited
an outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability
and rate capability. ZnFe2O4/PDA composites
delivered an initial discharge capacity of 2079 mAh g–1 at 1 A g–1 and showed a minimum capacity decay
after 150 cycles. Importantly, the coating layer improved the rate
capability of composites compared to that of its counterpart, the
bare ZnFe2O4 particle materials. The outstanding
electrochemical performance was because of the buffering and protective
effects of the PDA coating layer, which could be a general protection
strategy for electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries.

Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) have been widely applied to electronic
devices, electric vehicles (EVs), and hybrid electric vehicles.1 LIBs have become increasingly popular and have
attracted tremendous attention in the past decades.2,3 The
increasing demands for high-performance LIBs have motivated significant
research in exploring low-cost and high-performance electrode materials.
Otherwise, anode materials are key ingredients of LIBs.4,5 Nowadays, commercial graphite has been used as the anode material
in LIBs. However, it suffers from low theoretical capacity (372 mAh
g–1) and fast capacity fading, especially at higher
current rates, which hinder the increasing demands of LIBs for EVs
and other higher power applications.4,6 Therefore,
it is vitally necessary to develop anode materials with high capacity,
steady cycling, and rate performance.7

To overcome these challenges, many studies focused on the electrochemical
Li-storage properties of ternary mixed transition metal oxides (TMOs),
including MeMn2O4 (Me = Fe, Mg, Zn, Cu), MeCo2O4 (Me = Zn, Co, and Ni), and MeFe2O4 (Me = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn).8−12 Among these ternary mixed TMOs, MeFe2O4 attract more attention as iron is cheaper, more abundant,
and environmental friendly. Among all of the candidates, ZnFe2O4 attracts the most attention owing to its low
cost, easy preparation, and high theoretical capacity (1000.5 mAh
g–1). However, ZnFe2O4 anode
materials greatly suffer from fast capacity fading and poor rate capability
arising from their low electronic conductivity and large volume expansion
in the lithiation–delithiation process, which is related to
its conversion reaction mechanism during charge–discharge cycles.13−15 Much effort has been dedicated to overcoming these pulverization
problems, such as introducing conductive agents and constructing nanostructures.16,17 Among these various methods, carbon coating has been widely recognized
as an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performance
of ZnFe2O4 particles. The carbon coating layer
can improve the electronic conductivity of ZnFe2O4 materials and simultaneously accommodate the strain of volume change
during the charge/discharge process, which ensure their structural
integrity and improve their cycling stability.18−23 Moreover, the coating protection of ZnFe2O4 materials can dramatically decrease the surface energy of ZnFe2O4 particles, which could mitigate the side reactions
between the electrode and electrolyte.24 However, despite the above-mentioned advantages, it is difficult
to fabricate a conformal carbon coating layer on ZnFe2O4 materials, which usually needs pyrolysis and chemical vapor
deposition processes.25

Marine mussels
exhibit highly strong adhesion to a wide variety
of organic and inorganic substances. The affinity of marine mussels
to their substances is mainly associated with adhesive proteins containing
abundant catecholamine. Dopamine, a mussel-inspired adhesion material
containing both catechol and amine groups, can be polymerized at mild
basic pH to form an adhesive polymer polydopamine (PDA) film on a
wide range of substrates. The PDA film plays an important role in
surface science.26,27 Besides the adhesive property,
the PDA film has good ionic permeability, which allows the ions penetrate
through the film, which could be used for modifying electrode materials
for LIBs. The PDA-modified separators can improve the wetting ability,
the electrolyte uptake, and the ionic conductivity. PDA has been used
to modify the sulfur cathode in Li/S battery and CuO, SnO2, Si, and Ti–Si alloy anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.26−30 PDA coating layer can effectively improve their electrochemical
performances.

Herein, novel ZnFe2O4/PDA
composites were
successfully synthesized through a facile sol–gel synthesis
and an in situ polymerization approach. The obtained ZnFe2O4/PDA composites exhibited very high reversible capacity,
excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. ZnFe2O4/PDA composites delivered an initial discharge
capacity of 2079 mAh g–1 at 1 A g–1 and retained a reversible discharge capacity of 2074 mAh g–1 after 150 cycles. More importantly, ZnFe2O4/PDA electrode showed an excellent rate capability, which exhibited
a reversible discharge capacity of 1187 mAh g–1 at
5 A g–1.

Results and Discussion
The fabrication
process of ZFDA1 composite is illustrated in Figure 1, which mainly consists
of two processes. First, ZF800 was synthesized by sol–gel method.
Subsequently, PDAs were homogeneously coated on the surface of ZF800
by the self-polymerization of dopamine in the presence of buffer solution.
The obtained ZFDA1 delivered the most optimal electrochemical performance
compared to that of the ZFDA2, ZFDA3, and ZFDA4 electrodes. Detailed
information of the structure, morphology, coating layer, and electrochemical
performances of ZFDA2, ZFDA3, and ZFDA4 samples is presented in Supporting
Information Figures S1–S3. Figure 2a shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZF800 and ZFDA1 samples. Most of the
observed diffraction peaks were well consistent with cubic spinel
ZnFe2O4 (JCPDS card no. 22-1012, space group Fd3m, space group no. 227). Compared to
the XRD pattern of ZF800, the pattern of ZFDA1 showed a decrease in
peak intensity due to the presence of the PDA layer on the crystal.
Obviously, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 18.24, 30.0,
35.34, 36.97, 42.95, 47.03, 53.28, and 56.79° could be associated
with the reflections obtained from (111), (220), (311), (222), (400),
(331), (422), and (511) planes of the ZF800 and ZFDA1 samples. The
strong intensity and narrow peak width of diffraction peaks indicated
that the samples were well crystallized. In addition, the ZF800 and
ZFDA1 samples showed some small impurity peaks (Figure 2a), which were well matched with Fe2O3 (JCPDS card no. 84-0307). The Fe2O3 peaks appeared with the increasing calcination temperature of ZnFe2O4.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of ZF800 and ZFDA1 (a), Fourier
transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of ZF800 and ZFDA1 (b), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) survey spectra of C 1s and N 1s for ZFDA1 composites (c) and
(d).

FTIR was carried out to examine
the surface functional groups of
the ZF800 and ZFDA1 samples. As shown in Figure 2b, both ZFDA1 and ZF800 samples exhibited
strong characteristic peaks at 543 cm–1, which should
be attributed to the vibration of the Zn–O bond. The absorption
peak of Zn–O bond in ZFDA1 was weaker than that of ZF800, which
was related to the PDA coating layer. In the spectrum of ZFDA1, two
peaks at 1500 and 1600 cm–1 appeared, which were
due to the aromatic rings in the PDA layer.32−35 Compared to those of the ZF800
samples, absorption peaks of ZFDA1 at 3434 cm–1 are
broad, which was ascribed to the stretching vibration absorption of
−NH groups linked to the composites.36 These results clearly suggested that the PDA conductive polymer
was successfully coated on the surface of ZnFe2O4.

The polymer coating layer of ZFDA1 was further characterized
by
XPS. As shown in Figure 2c,d, the C 1s XPS of PDA is presented in Figure 2c. The peaks at binding energies of 284.5,
285.4, and 288.1 eV were consistent with the nonoxygenated carbon
C–C, carbon in C–O, and C–N.37,38 In addition, Figure 2d shows the peak centered at 399.6 eV, which was associated with
C–N.36 These features were all typical
peak positions of PDA. The survey spectrum indicated the presence
of PDA coating layer, which was in good accordance with the result
of FTIR (Figure 2b).

The surface morphologies of ZF800 and ZFDA1 composites are shown
in Figure 3. The average
crystallite sizes of the compounds were 100–200 nm. The morphologies
of ZF800 particles were similar to those of ZFDA1 composites (Figure 3a,b). Compared to
those of the ZF800 samples, the particles of ZFDA1 were wrapped by
homogenous and continuous PDA layer. PDA had high affinity to ZnFe2O4 particles and played a significant role in forming
a homogenous and continuous PDA layer. The high affinity of PDA was
associated with its catechol group, which can coordinate with Fe element
in ZnFe2O4.39 In
addition, the element mapping images presented a uniform distribution
of Fe, Zn, O, C, and N elements in the ZFDA1 composites, which revealed
that PDA was well coated on the surface of ZF800.

electron microscope (FESEM) images of ZF800
(a, b) and ZFDA1 (c, d), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) mapping images of ZFDA1 (e).

The microstructures of ZF800 samples and ZFDA1 composites
were
further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation,
and the results are shown in Figure 4. It was confirmed that the ZF800 samples were embedded
in the homogenous and continuous PDA layer and the thickness of the
PDA layer was about 8 nm, which was in accordance with the results
of FESEM images (Figure 3c,d). Figure 4e shows
that the values of interplanar spacing of the ordered crystallites
structure were 0.254 and 0.298 nm, which corresponded well with the
(311) and (220) crystal planes of ZnFe2O4 particles
(JCPDS card no. 22-1012).

and f).

The electrochemical behavior of
lithium ion with the obtained ZF800
and ZFDA1 as electrodes was investigated at a current density of 1
A g–1, and the results are shown in Figure 5a. The ZFDA1 electrode exhibited
initial charge and discharge capacities of 1438.6 and 2079 mAh g–1, respectively, which were higher than those of the
ZF800 electrode. The discharge capacity of the ZFDA1 electrode slowly
decreased to 1407.4 mAh g–1 in the initial eight
cycles, whereas for the ZF800 electrode it decreased to 1160.5 mAh
g–1. Noticeably, the capacities of both ZFDA1 and
ZF800 slightly increased to 1807.9 and 1540.2 mAh g–1 at the 100th cycle, respectively, which should be due to the wettability
of the electrodes. After 150 charging/discharging cycles, the ZFDA1
electrode reached a discharge capacity of 2074 mAh g–1 and no apparent capacity decay was observed. In contrast, the ZF800
electrode began to show capacity decay after 100 cycles. Clearly,
the electrochemical performance of ZFDA1 composite was superior to
that of ZF800. This result confirmed that the particles dispersed
and embedded well in the PDA coating layer, which could buffer the
volume changes of the active materials during electrochemical cycling,
resulting in the improvement of electrochemical performance and cycle
life.26,27

Figure 5 Cycling performances of ZF800 and ZFDA1 electrodes
at the current
density of 1 A g–1 (a) and rate capabilities of
ZF800 and ZFDA1 electrodes (b).

The rate performances of ZF800 and ZFDA1 electrodes were
further
tested at different current densities. As shown in Figure 5b, the ZFDA1 electrode showed
higher reversible capacities than did the ZF800 electrode with the
current density ranging from 0.1 to 5 A g–1. The
ZFDA1 electrode delivered discharge capacities of 1441.7, 1418, 1429.8,
1390.6, 1313.7, and 1215.3 mAh g–1. At the higher
current density of 5 A g–1, the ZFDA1 electrode
also maintained a capacity of 1215.3 mAh g–1, which
was much higher than that of the ZF800 electrode (1015.6 mAh g–1). Subsequently, the current density reduced to 0.1
A g–1, the ZFDA1 electrode recovered the capacity
of 1722.7 mAh g–1 at the 70th cycle, and the ZF800
electrode was 1544.8 mAh g–1. The superior rate
performance of ZFDA1 should be ascribed to PDA coating layer. The
existence of the catechol and amine polar groups of the PDA increased
electrolyte wetting and enhanced ionic conductivity of the electrode.26,40 Clearly, the PDA coating layer played a key role in improving rate
performance.

Figure 6a,b shows
the charge/discharge curves of ZF800 and ZFDA1 electrodes for the
first, second, third, fourth, and fifth cycles at the current density
of 1 A g–1 between 0.005 and 3 V. The initial capacity
loss was mainly caused by the formation of the solid electrolyte interface
and the irreversible reaction on the electrode surface.24,36 During the initial lithiation process, there was a voltage plateau
located at 0.86 V, which was due to the phase transition from ZnFe2O4 to LixZnFe2O4 (x ∼ 0.5).41 Furthermore, two plateaus at about 0.7 and 0.4 V for the
ZFDA1 electrode and at 0.7 V for the ZF800 electrode were due to the
reduction of Fe2+ and Zn2+ to metallic states
during the formation of Li–Zn alloys and Li2O,24,42−44 which were in good agreement with the results of
cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement.

Figure 6 Voltage profiles of ZFDA1 (a) and ZF800
(b) for the first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth cycles at the current density of 1 A g–1, and CV curves of ZFDA1 for the first three cycles
at 0.1 mV s–1 between 0.005 and 3 V (c).

To further investigate the electrochemical properties
of ZFDA1
and ZF800 during the cycling process, CV measurements were first performed. Figures 6c and 7 show the CV curves of ZFDA1 for the first three cycles at
a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in the potential ranging
from 0.005 to 3 V. It was clear that the initial cathodic peak was
obviously different from that of the subsequent cycles. During the
first cathodic sweep of ZFDA1, one small reduction peak could be observed
at about 0.86 V, which usually originated from Li intercalation into
ZnFe2O4 to form the intercalation phase, LixZnFe2O4.41 Other reduction peaks centered at about 0.7 and 0.4 V for
the ZFDA1 electrode were due to the reduction of Fe2+ and
Zn2+ to metallic states during the formation of Li–Zn
alloys and Li2O.24,42−44 In the subsequent cycles, these cathodic peaks shifted to about
0.9 V, which was in accordance with the reversible lithium storage
associated with the reversible reduction of ZnO and Fe2O3 to metal particles embedded in Li2O.43 Furthermore, the initial anodic potential peak
locating at about 1.58 V was attributed to the oxidation of Fe0 and Zn0 to Fe2O3 and ZnO.41 The CV curves did not change significantly on
the further sweeps, suggesting the good cycling stability of ZFDA1.

Figure 7 Electrochemical
impedance spectra of ZF800 particles and ZFDA1
composites; the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were
recorded after 50 cycles.

The enhanced electrochemical performance of the ZFDA1 electrode
was further supported by EIS measurements from 10–1 to 105 after 50 cycles. The Nyquist plots all consisted
of a depressed semicircle in high-medium-frequency range and an inclined
line in the low-frequency region. The semicircle related to the charge
transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrode
system and the electrolyte resistance (Re). The inclined line was derived from the Warburg impedance (Zw) corresponding to the lithium-ion diffusion
in electrode materials.24,39,43 The radius of the semicircle barely changed for both electrodes.
As observed from the slope of the inclined line, the impedance of
the ZF800 electrode was significantly higher than that of the ZFDA1
electrode. These evidences demonstrated that the PDA layer would not
decrease the transportation of Li ions and generate a lower diffusion
resistance during continuous charge/discharge processes.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel approach to fabricate a functional PDA coating
layer was developed to accommodate the volume expansion through a
facile and biomimetic method. It was a simple and low-cost method
of synthesizing a uniform bionic ionic permeable PDA film coated on
ZnFe2O4. Compared with the methods using carbonized
polymers, this method is simple and energy-saving, which has good
potential in the large-scale application of high-capacity electrode
materials. The ZnFe2O4 with PDA coating exhibited
initial charge and discharge capacities of 1438.6 and 2079 mAh g–1, respectively. After charging/discharging cycle for
150 cycles at the current density of 1 A g–1, the
electrode still maintained a discharge capacity as high as 2074 mAh
g–1. More importantly, the conductive polymer coating
of ZnFe2O4 significantly improved the rate capability
at high current densities. The excellent electrochemical performance
is believed to be ascribed to the homogenous and continuous PDA coating,
which could accommodate the volume change. The rational designed materials
showed an outstanding performance as anode for LIBs, and this biomimetic
method could be a general protection method for electrode materials
for LIBs.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All of the chemicals used
in this experiment
were analytical grade without any further purification. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and dopamine hydrochloride
were provided by Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and glycine were purchased
from Tianjin Denn Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and Huzhou Biological
Chemical Co. Ltd., respectively. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride
(Tris-HCl) was provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

Synthesis
of ZnFe2O4 Particles
In a typical sol–gel
synthesis, 10 mmol Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 20 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and
60 mmol glycine were dissolved in 40 mL
of distilled water. Then, the sample was kept at 60 °C with constant
magnetic stirring for 12 h to form bronzing gel. Subsequently, the
resulting bronzing gel was transferred into a muffle furnace and treated
at 100 °C to obtain the bulk precursor. Finally, the obtained
bulk precursor was calcined in a tube furnace under air atmosphere
at 160 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 and then at 800 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The obtained ZnFe2O4 was called
ZF800.

Synthesis of ZnFe2O4/PDA Composite
First, 200 mg of ZnFe2O4 particles and 40 mg
of dopamine hydrochloride were dispersed into 20 mL of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
hydrochloride (Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). The above-mentioned four same mixtures
were stirred for 2, 4, 6, and 10 h at room temperature. The obtained
composites were washed three times by deionized water and dried at
80 °C for 12 h. The samples stirred for 2, 4, 6, and 10 h were
denoted ZFDA1, ZFDA2, ZFDA3, and ZFDA4, respectively.

Characterizations
The crystal structures of ZFDA1 and
ZF800 were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the 2θ
range of 10–80°, which were performed by Bruker D8 Advance
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The morphologies
of all of the samples were determined using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700F). The element composition was
observed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The crystal structure
details were further determined using transition electron microscopy
(TEM); the TEM images were collected by JEOL JEM-2100 microscope with
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was performed by Kratos Axis Ultra spectroscopy with
a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν =
1486.6 eV). FTIR spectra of the materials were recorded on the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Themo Nicole 670FT-IR).

Electrochemical Measurements
To test the electrochemical
performance, the samples were mixed with super-P and sodium alginate
solution at the mass ratio of 4:4:2 in distilled water to form homogenous
slurry by ball-milling for 12 h. The slurry was pasted onto a copper
foil and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. Subsequently,
the obtained electrode was punched to circle plates with the diameter
of 12 mm, whose mass loading was about 1.6 mg cm–2, close to that in another study.31 CR
2032 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The
pure Li metal was used as the counter electrode and microporous membrane
was used as a separator. The electrolyte used here was 1.0 mol L–1 LiPF6 in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate
and dimethyl carbonate (1:1 by v/v). The galvanostatic discharging–charging
measurements and rate capability of the test cells were tested using
a LAND Cell test system (CT2001A, Wuhan, China) at 0.005–3.0
V (vs Li/Li+). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cells were conducted using a Solartron
Analytical electrochemical workstation. The EIS data were recorded
at the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with an alternating
current voltage amplitude of 10 mV.
