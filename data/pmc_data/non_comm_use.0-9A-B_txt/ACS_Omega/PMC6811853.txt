Ring-fused
diphenylchlorins as potent low-dose photosensitizers
for photodynamic therapy of bladder carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma
are described. All studied molecules were very active against HT1376
urinary bladder carcinoma and OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell
lines, showing IC50 values below 50 nM. The in vivo evaluation
of the more promising photosensitizer, using an OE19 tumor/chick embryo
chorioallantoic membrane model, showed a tumor weight regression of
33% with a single photodynamic therapy treatment with the photosensitizer
dose as low as 37 ng/embryo.

1 Introduction
Photodynamic
therapy (PDT) has been used in the treatment of several
types of cancers1−8 and also in other diseases, such as actinic keratosis,9−11 acne,12,13 Barrett’s esophagus,14,15 and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).16,17 PDT is based on the administration of a photosensitizer (PS), which
selectively locates itself in the tumor cells followed by visible
light irradiation. Suitable light exposure of the tumor region leads
to the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), for example,
hydroxyl radicals, the superoxide anion, and singlet oxygen, that
induce cell death. These features provide PDT with an interesting
and much valued dual selectivity.18 Photosensitizer
molecules should be activated with light of 600 to 800 nm wavelengths, the phototherapeutic window, which
bears enough energy to produce ROS, can reach deeper into the tissues
and avoid excitation of endogenous chromophores.19,20 Therefore, one of the desirable characteristics of the photosensitizer
is to absorb strongly within this range. In fact, the most efficient
porphyrin-derived PSs are chlorins, hydroporphyrins that present typically
intense absorption bands in the red and near-infrared (NIR) regions.
Among these, either currently approved or in clinical trials, chlorins
Foscan,22−25 Verteporfin,26,27 and Radachlorin28,29 stand out.

The synthetic strategies for the preparation of
chlorins have been
centered on modifications of naturally occurring chlorins, total synthesis,
and transformation of porphyrins via reduction, cycloaddition, and
annulation reactions20,30−34 with the most common one being based on Whitlock’s
method of porphyrin reduction with diimide.35 However, this methodology affords chlorins with limited stability
due to the easy reoxidation to the porphyrin state and leads to the
formation of by-products, for example, other hydroporphyrins, making
the purification process extremely difficult in some cases. Our contribution
overcame this with the development of a new class of highly stable
ring-fused chlorins. Novel 4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-fused chlorins were synthesized via [8π
+ 2π] cycloaddition of transient 1,7-dipole diazafulvenium methides
with porphyrins.36,37 Further studies demonstrated
that this kind of ring-fused meso-tetraphenylchlorins,
particularly a new dihydroxymethyl derivative, has an impressive performance
against human skin malignant melanoma.38 Furthermore, the incorporation of the platinum(II) metal into their
structure originated excellent theranostic agents for imaging, PDT,
and molecular oxygen sensing.39

Our
contribution to PDT of melanoma extended to the study of novel
ring-fused 5,15-diphenylchlorins (Figure 1). These chlorins were even more photocytotoxic
against A375 skin malignant melanoma cells than the corresponding
tetraphenyl analogues, presenting IC50 values as low as
2.9 nM.40 Furthermore, for one of the derivatives
(chlorin 3), the cell death outcome, apoptosis versus
necrosis, was determined by its concentration. This can be explored
to control the type of cell death in order to improve the effectiveness
of PDT considering that an inflammatory response resulting from necrotic
cell death after PDT can activate the antitumor immune response with
implications also on vascular damage.20,21 This feature
combined with very low dark cytotoxicity makes chlorin 3 a particular interesting photosensitizer for PDT.

UV–vis absorption spectra, and IC50 values against
A375 melanoma cells of chlorins 1–4.40

These outstanding results led us to further explore chlorins 1–4 as PDT agents against other selected
cancers. PDT has been proven beneficial to both esophageal and urinary
bladder carcinomas due to easy endoscopic irradiation, representing
an effective, powerful, and minimally invasive treatment option.41,42 The use of PDT in these tumors offered long survival periods and
even a cure for some patients.43−46 To take a step forward and further examine the photosensitizing
capabilities of these ring-fused diphenylchlorins, we decided to spread
the scope of our research by carrying out early in vivo assessment
of the more promising photosensitizer using the chick embryo chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) model. Although the use of PSs and their accomplishments
concerning vascular development and angiogenesis,47,48 tissular O2 measuring,49,50 and cancer
diagnostics51,52 have been reported using this
model, this is still a somewhat underutilized in vivo assay when it
comes to cancer PDT.53,54 Details on our latest work regarding
the aforementioned topics are herein disclosed.

2 Results
and Discussion
Ring-fused diphenylchlorins 1–4 were prepared and isolated following synthetic
procedures established
at our labs and previously described (Figure 1).37,40 5,15-Diphenylporphyrin
was reacted with the diazafulvenium methide generated in situ from dimethyl 2,2-dioxo-1H,3H-pyrazolo[1,5-c][1,3]thiazole-6,7-dicarboxylate to afford the target 10,20-diphenylchlorins 1 and 2. The reduction of these diester chlorins
(1 and 2) with lithium aluminum hydride
led to the corresponding dihydroxymethyl chlorins (3 and 4).37,40 Chlorins 1–4 present photophysical properties that are adequate to their
use as photosensitizers with high absorption at the therapeutic window
and moderate to high singlet oxygen quantum yields.

The photocytotoxicity
of ring-fused diphenylchlorins 1–4 against human HT1376 urinary bladder carcinoma
and OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines was investigated; the
corresponding dose–response curves are presented in Figure 2, and related IC50/CI95 values are summarized in Table 1. PDT toxicity evaluation was
carried out 24 h after irradiation (a fluence rate of 7.5 mW/cm2, total fluence of 10 J, and a filtered light source with
a cutoff of <560 nm). Chlorins 1–4 showed high phototoxicity against bladder carcinoma cells with IC50 values between 12.8 and 43.0 nM. Photocytoxicity was also
very high against esophageal adenocarcinoma cells with IC50 values below 26.6 nM. Therefore, chlorins 1–4 were demonstrated to be remarkably powerful low-dose photosensitizing
agents showing IC50 values below 50 nM against all tumor
cell lines studied.

5,15-Diphenylchlorins
either with exocyclic methyl ester or hydroxymethyl
functionalities, 2 and 4, respectively,
proved to be better photodynamic agents against both cell lines than
10,20-diphenylchlorins 1 and 3. There was
a curious change regarding the previously reported results on the
PDT activity of diphenylchlorins 1–4 against melanoma (A375 cells) where the more hydrophilic hydroxymethyl
chlorins 3 and 4 were approximately 3 to
5 times more active than their equivalent methyl ester analogues 1 and 2.40 A different
structure–activity trend was observed with HT1376 and OE19
cells. Hence, in addition to the overall hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature
of the diphenylchlorin scaffold, it appears that the diphenyl substitution
pattern of the macrocycle, 5,15-diphenylchlorins versus 10,20-diphenyl,
is an important aspect and might play a differentiating part with
regard to the photodynamic therapy efficiency of this type of photosensitizers
across distinct tumor cells.

The chick embryo has long been
used as a prototypical organism
in several research areas, including oncobiology,55 although studies on photodynamic therapy are scarce.53,54 It is surrounded by the CAM, a highly vascularized extra-embryonic
membrane that can effortlessly be used to graft human cells. When
implanted on the CAM, tumor cells are capable of stimulating the formation
of new blood vessels, gaining their blood supply, which in turn allows
them to develop in a related fashion as in their natural hosts, that
is, to proliferate, invade, and metastasize to the chick embryonic
organs. This presents several key advantages over other standard animal
models: the chick embryo is naturally immunodeficient, thus easily
allowing mammalian tissue xenografts; the procedures are relatively
simple, involving short experimental times and low costs. Also, regarding
the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, the use of
nonmammal embryos does not encompass any legal or ethical restrictions.55−57

In a previous study, we demonstrated that chlorins 3 and 4 show a melanoma A375 cell uptake significantly
higher than the ones observed for the corresponding diester derivatives 1 and 2.40 On the
other hand, in vitro data showed some decrease in the metabolic activity
of both A375 skin malignant melanoma and HFF-1 fibroblast cells after
exposure to chlorin 4. Thus, dihydroxymethyl chlorin 3 showing no dark in vitro cytotoxicity was selected for the
in vivo chick embryo CAM assessment of a human OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma
model. The schematic protocol and timeline for this study is presented
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration
and timeline for the in vivo chick embryo
CAM assay (replicated with permission from Inovotion SAS, La Tronche/Grenoble,
France).

After nine days of incubation
(E9), when the embryo has reached
adequate development, the chorioallantoic membrane of White Leghorn
chicken eggs was grafted with OE19 cells. At day 11 (E11), all groups
of eggs were treated with either the administration vehicle (1% DMSO
in PBS, groups I and III) or chlorin 3 (608 nM, groups
II and IV). Ten minutes after administration, eggs of groups III and
IV were subjected to light irradiation using the conditions indicated
in the Supporting Information (see Table S1).

The number of dead and alive chick embryos was fully counted
at
E18 and combined with the surveillance of visible and macroscopic
anomalies (see Table S2); the key data
are displayed in Figure 4. Interestingly, we observed an ∼50% chick embryo mortality
rate in both light-exposed groups III and IV, but none whatsoever
when only chlorin 3 was administered in group II (15%
compared to 29% in the control group). This is a highly relevant outcome
of the toxicity assay performed because it markedly demonstrates that
the chick embryo mortality attained in the PDT group is mainly due
to the illumination conditions applied.

CAM assay toxicity analysis, presenting the
total, alive, and dead chick embryos for each group of eggs after
treatment at E18.

At day 18 (E18) of the
in vivo chick embryo CAM assay, the CAM
was collected and analyzed (see Figure 3). As can be seen in Table S3 and Figure 5, no
substantial tumor weight variation compared to the control group was
observed in groups II and III, which means that neither ring-fused
chlorin 3 nor light irradiation per se produced a cytotoxic
outcome on OE19 cells. However, the combination of the two, group
IV, that is, the PDT treatment group, prompted a substantial photodynamic
effect with a tumor weight regression of 33% reached with a single-treatment
protocol with the photosensitizer dose as low as 37 ng/embryo.

embryo CAM assay tumor growth analysis, presenting
mean values ± SEM of tumor weights (mg) for each group of eggs
after treatment. The upper portion of the CAM was detached at E18,
and the tumors were carefully removed from normal tissue and weighed.
Significant differences are represented by * where * means p < 0.05.

Genomic DNA was extracted
from the CAM and analyzed by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with specific primers for Alu sequences.
Since these are primate-specific short interspersed elements (SINEs)
with over 1 million copies of which are present in the human genome,
Alu sequences are useful targets for detecting human cells.58,59 From the information exhibited in Figure 6, it was possible to infer that no consequence,
either beneficial or detrimental, was verified in any of the treatment
groups under scrutiny, that is, the application of chlorin 3 or light irradiation on its own and the PDT group, given that the
fold variation of the relative amount of metastasis (RQ value) compared
to the control group/calibrator (which was arbitrarily set to 1) was
only ±0.3 at the most. This value is less than the 2-fold change
(RQ value greater than 2 or minor than 0.5) typically required to
be considered significative.60,61 Regarding the mean
cycle quantification (mean Cq) values attained, it stands to reason
that the number of cycles needed for a fluorescence signal to be detected
was quite nearly the same in all samples studied, between 25.41 and
26.28, regardless of the treatment groups and conditions (see Table S4). Therefore, our study demonstrated
that a nanomolar dose is enough to observe a PDT effect in the tumor
at the upper CAM without an antimetastatic effect in the lower CAM.

chick embryo CAM assay metastasis invasion analysis, presenting
relative amounts of metastasis in the lower CAM for each group of
eggs after treatment compared to the control group (in which an arbitrary
value of 1 was chosen). The effect on the metastatic invasion of the
OE19 cells was evaluated in a portion of the lower CAM collected at
E18. No significant differences were found between groups.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, the photocytotoxicity
of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-fused
10,20-diphenylchlorins and 5,15-diphenylchlorins
against human HT1376 urinary bladder carcinoma and OE19 esophageal
adenocarcinoma cell lines was examined, and IC50 values
of 12.8–43.0 and 12.9–26.6 nM, respectively, were obtained.
All molecules proved to be extraordinarily potent low-dose PSs.

Furthermore, structure–activity relationships could be identified.
The diphenyl substitution pattern of the macrocycle, 5,15-diphenylchlorins
versus 10,20-diphenyl, is the structural feature with higher impact
on the modulation of the PDT activity, although the overall hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
of the diphenylchlorin scaffold must also be considered. In fact,
the diester as well as the dihydroxymethyl 5,15-diphenylchlorin derivatives
presented a slightly superior photodynamic action against both cell
lines to their corresponding isomeric 10,20-diphenylchlorins.

Dihydroxymethyl 5,15-diphenylchlorin was chosen for the in vivo
evaluation using an OE19 tumor/chick embryo CAM model. Despite their
high photodynamic activity, this photosensitizer did not show cytotoxicity
per se since the chick embryo survival rate was very high (85%) when
the chlorin was applied without photoactivation. On the other hand,
no significant tumor weight variation was observed when the chlorin
or light irradiation was employed per se. Therefore, it was only under
the photodynamic treatment conditions that phototoxicity was observed
leading to a considerable tumor weight regression of 33% in a single-PDT
treatment while using a very low dose in the range of tens of nanograms
per embryo.

4 Experimental Section
Chlorins were
prepared from the reaction of 2,2-dioxo-1H,3H-pyrazolo[1,5-c][1,3]thiazole-6,7-dicarboxylate
and 5,15-diphenylporphyrin under microwave irradiation as previously
described.39

4.1 In Vitro
Tumor Cell Biology Assay
4.1.1 Cell Culture Conditions
The human
HT1376 (CRL1472) urinary bladder carcinoma cell line was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection. The human OE19 (96071721)
esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line was purchased from the European
Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures. The cell lines were cultured
according to standard procedures at 37 °C in a humidified incubator
with 95% air and 5% CO2. HT1376 cells were expanded using
the Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma D-5648),
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma
F7524), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/mL penicillin and
10 mg/mL streptomycin, Gibco 15140-122), and 100 μM sodium pyruvate
(Gibco Invitrogen Life Technologies; Gibco 1360). OE19 cells were
expanded using the Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI
1640, Sigma R4130), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Sigma F7524), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/mL
penicillin and 10 mg/mL streptomycin, Gibco 15140-122), and 400 mM
sodium pyruvate (Gibco Invitrogen Life Technologies; Gibco 1360).
For all studies, cells were detached using a solution of 0.25% trypsin–EDTA
(Gibco).

4.1.2 Photodynamic Treatment
For each
experiment, cells were plated and kept in an incubator overnight to
allow the attachment of the cells. The formulation of the chlorin
photosensitizers consisted of a 1 mg/mL solution in DMSO (Fisher Chemical,
200-664-3) with the desired concentrations achieved by successive
dilutions. Photosensitizers were administered in several concentrations
(from 5 pM to 10 μM), and cells were incubated for 24 h. Controls
were included on every plate, including untreated cell cultures and
cultures treated only with the vehicle of administration of the photosensitizers.
For this, DMSO was always administered with a concentration of 1%.
Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; in mM: 137
NaCl (JMGS), 2.7 KCl (Sigma), 10 Na2HPO4 (Merck),
and 1.8 KH2PO4 (Sigma); pH 7.4), and a new drug-free
medium was added. Each plate was irradiated with a fluence rate of
7.5 mW/cm2 until a total of 10 J was reached using a light
source equipped with a red filter (cutoff of <560 nm). Evaluation
was performed 24 h after photodynamic treatment.

4.1.3 Photocytotoxicity Analysis
The
sensitivity of the cell lines to the chlorin photosensitizers was
analyzed using the MTT colorimetric assay (Sigma M2128; Sigma-Aldrich,
Inc.) to measure metabolic activity. Cell culture plates were washed
and incubated with a solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma M5655) in PBS, pH 7.4, in the dark at 37
°C for at least 4 h. To solubilize formazan crystals, a 0.04
M solution of hydrochloric acid (Merck Millipore100317) in isopropanol
(Sigma 278475) was added. Absorbance was measured using an EnSpire
Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). Photocytotoxicity was expressed
as the percentage relative to cell cultures treated only with the
vehicle of administration of the photosensitizers. Dose–response
curves were obtained using Origin 9.0, and the concentration of the
photosensitizers that inhibits the proliferation of cultures at 50%
(IC50) was derived.

4.2 In Vivo
Chick Embryo CAM Assay
4.2.1 Materials
Fertilized
White Leghorn
chicken eggs (Hendrix Genetics, Saint Brieuc, France) were incubated
at 37.5 °C with 50% relative humidity for nine days. At this
time (E9), the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was dropped down by
carefully drilling a small hole through the eggshell into the air
sac, and a 1 cm2 window was cut in the eggshell directly
above the CAM.

4.2.2 Tumor Cell Induction
Human OE19
esophageal adenocarcinoma cells were cultured and expanded as described
above, harvested by trypsinization, washed with complete medium, and
suspended in a serum-free graft medium. An inoculation of 5 ×
105 cells onto the CAM of each egg was made at day 9 (E9).
The eggs were then randomly allocated into 4 groups with at least
20 eggs/group.

4.2.3 Treatment
At
day 10 (E10), tumors
began to be detectable. At day 11 (E11), the groups were treated with
100 μL of chlorin 3 (608 nM) or the administration
vehicle (1% DMSO in PBS), following the conditions summarized in the
Supporting Information (see Table S1).
Ten minutes after injection in the tumor mass, eggs of groups III
and IV were placed under the light source (a CoolLED pE-4000 universal
illumination system equipped with a collimator, see Figure S1) for irradiation using red light (635 nm) with a
fluence of 2.5 J/cm2. The light source with a collimator
was previously calibrated on eggs grafted with OE19 cells at day 11
(E11) using white light in order to achieve efficient illumination
closely around the treated area, that is, centered on the tumor (see Figure S2, top). The distance between the surface
of the upper CAM and the light source with the collimator was 26 cm,
and the diameter of the circle illuminated in the upper CAM was 2.5
cm (see Figure S2, bottom). The time of
irradiation needed to reach 2.5 J/cm2 was 1 min at 83 mW.

4.2.4 Tumor Growth Analysis
At day 18
(E18), the upper portion of the CAM was removed, washed with PBS and
then directly transferred in 4% p-formaldehyde solution
(fixation for 48 h). The tumors were then carefully cut away from
normal CAM tissue and weighed. A one-way ANOVA analysis with post-hoc
tests was then performed on the data (see Table S3).

4.2.5 Metastasis Invasion Analysis
A
1 cm2 portion of the lower CAM was collected to evaluate
the number of metastasis cells. Genomic DNA was extracted from the
CAM using a commercial kit (MagJET Genomic DNA Kit, Ref. K2721, Thermo
Scientific) and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) with specific primers for human Alu sequences (sense: 5′-ACG
CCT GTA ATC CCA GCA CTT-3′; antisense: 5′-TCG CCC AGG
CTG GAG TGCA-3′). The amplification and detection of these
Alu sequences by qPCR was performed on 30 ng of genomic DNA in a final
volume of 20 μL/point using a Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch detection
system with the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min followed
by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C
for 30 s. The variation in the Alu signal relative to the total amount
of genomic DNA (and, therefore, changes in the quantity of human DNA
in the CAM tissue) as well as statistical analysis on the data obtained
was calculated using Bio-Rad CFX Maestro software (see Table S4).

4.2.6 Toxicity
Analysis
The number of
dead and alive chick embryos was totally counted seven days after
treatment (E18) and combined with the observation of visible and macroscopic
abnormalities (see Table S2).
