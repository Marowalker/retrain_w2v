Herein, we have employed
first-principles calculations to investigate
the interaction between XY dual-doped graphene (DDG) (X = AL, Si,
P, S; Y = B, N, O) and sodium/potassium. The introduction of two dopants
alters the adsorption energy (AE) of sodium and potassium with respect
to perfect graphene by an average of 0.88 and 0.66 eV, respectively.
The systems that display the strongest interactions with the two alkalies
assayed are SN and SiB DDG. Although the adsorption energy of sodium
on graphene is weaker in comparison to that of potassium, the introduction
of these dopants significantly reduces this difference. In effect,
in some cases, the AE-K and AE-NA differ by less than 0.05 eV. The
protrusion of the 3p dopants out of the graphene plane creates a hole
where sodium and potassium can easily be intercalated between two
layers of dual-doped graphene. The interlayer distances are reduced
by less than 0.4 Å after K intercalation, making the process
very favorable. Finally, most importantly, this eminent rise in adsorption
energies guarantees exceptional storage capacities at the cost of
low doping concentration.

1 Introduction
In 2020, the Protocol
of Kyoto1 comes
to an end and the Paris2 agreement will
be implemented to limit the temperature rise of the planet by less
than 1.5 °C, with respect to preindustrial levels. The achievement
of this goal requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
For this reason, major automobile companies are planning to use solely
battery-powered engines in their near future, as the famous Rolls
Royce Company has recently announced.3 In
fact, countries like France are planning to prohibit the commercialization
of fossil fuel-based cars by 2040.4 Over
the last few decades, lithium has been extensively used to design
the best rechargeable batteries. In particular, graphene has been
considered to be the most promising material to improve the performance
of lithium-based batteries.5−9 A large number of theoretical investigations have been devoted to
understanding the interaction between lithium and graphene,10−18 as well as with sulfur,19 fullerenes,20 transition-metal dichalgogenides,21 or two-dimensional boron materials.22 And this task has not been easy because the
interaction between carbon materials and alkalies is affected by the
self-interaction error when using density functional theory.23−27 For example, it is difficult to obtain a reasonable
picture with the most popular density functionals even for the benzene-alkali
systems.22,23 Nevertheless, theoretical calculations have
been very useful to shed light into the chemistry behind alkali-based
secondary batteries.10−18 Recently, we studied the effect of dual doping on the adsorption
of lithium onto mono (X) and dual-doped (XY) graphene, where X = B,
N, O; Y = Al, Si, P, S.28 Interestingly,
we found that for all dual-doped graphene (DDG) systems, the clustering
of lithium is inhibited. In the particular case of nitrogen-doped
graphene, the adsorption energy (AE) of lithium is lower than that
computed for pristine graphene. However, when nitrogen is combined
with aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, or sulfur, the AE is tremendously
improved. The most paradigmatic case is that of SN DDG, which presents
the strongest AE with Li: −2.99 eV, at the van der Waals density
functional (vdW-DF)/double-ζ plus polarization (DZP) level.
This value is almost three times the AE of Li over pristine graphene.
This result is not entirely surprising because, among dual-doped graphene
systems, the SN-doped flavor seems to display unique properties.29−38 Although, lithium is the best choice for alkali-based rechargeable
batteries, the problem is that it would be impossible to meet the
global demand if it is supposed to replace gasoline. Sodium and potassium
are much more abundant than lithium in the Earth’s crust. For
this reason, they are good candidates to surrogate lithium. However,
important challenges must be faced to design useful sodium or potassium
rechargeable batteries with reasonable lifetimes.39−43 Bearing in mind the impressive results that we obtained
when lithium interacts with DDG,28 we considered
that a study that investigates the adsorption of sodium and potassium
on these doped graphene systems can help to pave the way toward the
development of useful lithium-free rechargeable batteries.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Sodium Adsorption on Dual-Doped
Graphene
The adsorption energy (AE) of sodium on graphene
is −0.67
eV, at the vdW-DF/DZP level. This value is 0.44 eV higher than the
one computed for lithium (−1.11 eV), using the same methodology.
Also, it is significantly smaller than the cohesive energy of bulk
sodium, which is −1.078 eV/atom. Therefore, graphene should
be modified to inhibit the agglomeration of sodium atoms. In Table 1, we gathered the
AE of sodium on 12 DDG systems when sodium is adsorbed below the 3p
dopant. At the vdW-DF/DZP level, for 9 cases, studied the adsorption
of sodium is stronger than the cohesive energy of bulk sodium. The
three DDG systems for which the AE is higher are PN, SO, and SB DDG,
but it is worth mentioning that all dopants decrease the AE with respect
to that of graphene. The variation of the AE upon doping strongly
depends on the choice of heteroatoms introduced. According to the
vdW-DF/DZP results, the lowest AE was determined for SiB DDG (−2.13
eV), being closely followed by SN DDG (−2.00 eV). This trend
is different than that observed for the adsorption of lithium on DDG,28 because SN DDG exhibited the lowest AE, and
SiB DDG exhibited the second lowest. The net effect of introducing
a pair of SiB/SN dopants is a 3.2/3.0 time decrease of the AE of sodium
with respect to that of graphene. The results obtained employing the
PBE-D2 method and plane waves also point to a significant decrease
of the AE when two dopants are introduced. However, SN DDG presents
the lowest AE, closely followed by SiB DDG. Thus, it seems to be clear
that SN and SiB DDG are the best candidates for increasing the affinity
of graphene toward sodium.

Finally, to support the outcome of the vdW-DF and
PBE-D2 calculations,
we determined the AE onto a hydrogen-terminated graphene cluster.
The AE obtained employing the circumcoronene model also indicated
a significant increase in the affinity toward sodium adsorption. In
line with the PBE-D2 results, SN DDG presents the lowest AE at the
M06-2X/6-311G* level of theory, and SiB DDG the second lowest. For
SN/SiB DDG, the AE of sodium decreases 7.4/6.4 times with respect
to that of graphene. In light of these results, we can confirm that
there is a remarkable decrease in the AE of sodium upon doping. Also,
this effect is larger than the one observed for lithium. In effect,
the AE of Li onto SN DDG is 2.9 times lower than that computed for
graphene.28

2.2 Potassium
Adsorption on Dual-Doped Graphene
The lower cohesive energy
of bulk potassium with respect to that
of lithium and sodium is an advantage to develop potassium-anode materials,
but its large size is a problem. The cohesive energy of bulk potassium
is −0.934 eV/atom, about 0.18 eV higher than that for sodium.
Interestingly, the AE of potassium on graphene is lower than the cohesive
energy of bulk potassium by 0.144 eV. In Table 2, the AE of potassium onto DDG are presented.
In line with the results obtained for sodium, all dopants decrease
the AE, but in the case of potassium, all of the AE are lower than
the cohesive energy of bulk potassium. In fact, when considering the
12 DDG systems, the average AE for potassium is −1.76 eV whereas
that of sodium is −1.55 eV, at the vdW-DF/DZP level. This trend
is not surprising because the AE of potassium on graphene is lower
by 0.33 eV, with respect to that of sodium. The lowest AE is observed
for SN and SiB DDG. At the vdW-DF/DZP level, the AE is −2.43
eV in both cases. This value is 2.2 times lower than the value determined
for graphene. This finding is fully supported by the PBE-D2 calculations
performed with VASP. Indeed, the AE determined for SN and SiB DDG
are −3.03 and −3.06 eV, respectively. In agreement with
the vdW-DF results, the AE is 2.2 times lower after co-doping.

c Lowest values are in bold.

The variations observed for the AE of potassium on DDG systems
were reproduced by the M06-2X calculations carried out for dual-doped
circumcoronene. However, again SN DDG is the best system if we are
interested in obtaining record-breaking AE. At the M06-2X/6-311G*
level, the AE of potassium on SN DDG is 3.8 times lower than that
for graphene. This enhancement is almost a half of that observed for
sodium at the same level of theory. This result is likely to be linked
to the fact that the bonding of sodium on graphene is weaker than
for potassium.

2.3 Comparison between Sodium
and Potassium
Inspection of the results presented in Tables 1 and 2 clearly indicates
that the AE can be finely tuned if the adequate combination of dopants
is selected. Also, it is clear that for the 12 cases assayed, the
dual doping is an effective method to increase the adhesion of these
two alkalies onto graphene. For sodium and potassium, the differences
between the largest and lowest AEs are very similar. For example,
at the vdW-DF/DZP level, it is 1.17 eV for sodium, whereas the value
computed for potassium is 1.34 eV. However, the M06-2X method suggests
a value that is twice larger. This deviation is likely to be related
to the fact that for the latter functional, we used a circumcoronene
model. This statement is supported by the results obtained when the
cluster models are studied using the PBE-D2/6-311G* method. For example,
in the case of potassium, the difference between the largest and lowest
AE is 1.58 eV, significantly larger than the value obtained using
the PBE-D2 method and periodic conditions, namely, 1.1 eV.

The
four methods employed suggested stronger adsorption for potassium
as compared to that of sodium. In the case of pristine graphene, the
AEs of potassium are lower than those computed for sodium by 0.43,
0.51, 0.32, and 0.39 eV, at the vdW-DF/DZP, M06-2X/6-311G*, PBE-D2,
and PBE-D2/6-311G* levels of theory, respectively. However, after
doping, these values become smaller. In effect, the average difference
between the AE-K and AE-Na is 0.25, 0.39, 0.14, and 0.23 eV, at the
vdW-DF/DZP, M06-2X/6-311G*, PBE-D2, and PBE-D2/6-311G* levels of theory,
respectively. Therefore, doping is an effective method to equilibrate
the AE of sodium and potassium on graphene. It is difficult to identify
a method that can predict when the AE of sodium and potassium are
more similar. For example, at the PBE-D2 level, the difference AE-K
– AE-Na is 0.04 eV for AlO DDG, about 0.1 eV smaller than the
average value. A similar trend is observed if the vdW-DF method is
employed. However, discrepancies occur for SB and PO DDG. Inspection
of the M06-2X results seems to indicate that AlO DDG is the system
for which sodium and potassium display more similar AE. Finally, the
PBE-D2/6-311G* results are not in line with those obtained with the
same functional and periodic conditions. Indeed, the cluster model
calculations performed at the PBE-D2/6-311G* level of theory indicated
that for PB DDG, the AE of potassium is only 0.02 eV lower than that
computed for sodium.

2.4 Why is Co-Doping So Useful?
In the
introduction, we mentioned that the adsorption of Li on N-doped graphene
(N in graphitic configuration) is weaker than that on undoped graphene.
This is not strange since nitrogen has one more electron than carbon
and thus induces an n-type doping. In contrast, boron, which is a
p-type dopant, significantly increases the adsorption of Li on graphene.
Given that boron has one electron less than carbon, it facilitates
the charge transfer from lithium to graphene. The AE of Li on B-doped
graphene is −2.41 eV, more than twice the value computed for
graphene. On the same lines, Al also improves the interaction since
the AE of Li on Al-doped graphene is −2.71 eV. This value is
0.3 eV larger than that computed for B-doped graphene. In the case
of Al, there is another fact, besides having one electron less than
carbon, which contributes to lowering the AE: the introduction of
a 3p dopant induces significant structural modifications, as can be
appreciated in Figure 1. In effect, a hole is created around the dopant, which facilitates
the interaction of the alkali with the carbon atoms. This finding
is not new; it has been documented before that the adsorption on curved
π surfaces is stronger than that on planar ones.59 Also, this is the reason why the adsorption
below the 3p dopant is much stronger than that above it.28 In the particular base of SiB DDG, the two factors
are maximized. On one hand, we have the p-type doping of graphene.
On the other hand, silicon creates the structural distortion that
creates a hole where sodium or potassium can be adsorbed. Finally,
in the case of SN DDG, the peculiar structure of this system is the
reason behind the strong affinity toward alkalies. As we have explained
in our previous investigation of SN DDG,29−31 the S and N
dopants replace a CC bond but are not bonded. Therefore, nitrogen
adopts a pyridinic configuration, which facilitates the interaction
with alkalies. We note that the interaction between alkalies and pyridinic
nitrogen is markedly different than that observed for graphitic nitrogen.
This is not surprising since it is well documented that in the Li:::pyridine
complex, the Li atom prefers a σ bonding mode, i.e., Li near
the nitrogen and in the pyridine plane, instead of a π complexation.60 Thus, to make the N doping of graphene useful,
the pyridinic configuration of the nitrogen dopant should be favored
during the synthetic procedure.

2.5 Electronic
Structure of SN and SiB Dual-Doped
Graphene with Adsorbed Alkalies
In our previous work about
lithium adsorption on DDG, we found that when lithium is adsorbed
on SN DDG the system is not a metal but a semiconductor with a gap
of 0.2 eV for an 8 × 8 unit cell. This results in a contrast
with the electronic structure determined when lithium is adsorbed
on pristine graphene since this system has a metallic character. In Figure 2, we present the
band structure and density of states determined when potassium is
adsorbed on SN DDG. In line with the results obtained for lithium,
a gap of 0.42 eV is opened. In the same vein, when potassium is adsorbed
on SiB DDG, we can observe in Figure 3 that the system is a semiconductor. In this case,
the gap is smaller, that is, 0.21 eV. The partial density of states
clearly shows that the empty potassium states are located far from
the Fermi level. For the sake of completeness, we plotted the band
structure and density of states for SN DDG with a sodium atom adsorbed.
As we can appreciate in Figure 4, the system is also a small band gap semiconductor.

2.6 Are the Cluster Model Calculations
Useful?
The use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon instead
of graphene
is useful to identify which combination of dopants is more useful
if one is interested in increasing the strength of the alkali–graphene
interaction. SN and SiB DDG have been indicated by the four methods
as the most promising materials to develop alkali-based rechargeable
batteries. Also, the four methods point to PN DDG as the system displaying
less affinity toward sodium. However, for potassium, the picture is
different as the DFT methods suggest three different systems to have
the highest AE with K: SB, PN, and PO DDG. Thus, the differences cannot
be attributed to the use of a finite graphene model.

In the
case of the PBE-D2/6-311G* method, the AEs computed using cluster
models are higher (less negative) than those obtained when using that
same functional and periodic conditions. On average, they are 0.35
and 0.45 eV higher than those computed for sodium and potassium, respectively.
This difference is expected to be increased if the basis set superposition
error (BSSE) is included for the PBE-D2/6-311G* calculations (Note:
PBE-D2 periodic calculations with VASP are BSSE free). On the contrary,
the AEs computed using the M06-2X/6-311G* method are among significantly
lower than those computed using the other methods. Although the doping
level is very similar, the hydrogen atoms of the cluster induce a
different charge distribution. For example, according to the Mulliken
analysis at the M06-L/6-311G* level, the 18 carbon atoms of circumcoronene
bonded to the hydrogen atoms bear a negative charge of −0.2e. However, in graphene, the carbon atoms located at the
same distance from the dopants are not charged. This difference, for
sure, will alter the long-range interactions.

2.7 Intercalation
in SN Dual-Doped Graphene
Due to their high affinity toward
alkalies, we investigated their
intercalation between two layers of SN DDG when both sulfur atoms
protrude out forming a hole, as shown in Figure 5. At the PBE-D2 level and using VASP, the
interaction energy between sodium and the two SN DDG layers is −6.32
eV. This value is larger (in absolute terms) than twice the Eads of
sodium on one layer of SN DDG by 0.50 eV. On the contrary, the interaction
is weaker than the sum of interlayer interaction energy of two layers
of SN DDG plus twice the AE of sodium on SN DDG by 2.03 eV. Thus,
some energy is clearly lost during the intercalation process. Yet,
it is not too much because of the hole created by the protrusion of
the sulfur atoms out of the graphene plane.

Figure 5 Optimized structure for
S, N dual-doped bilayer graphene with a
potassium atom intercalated.

Interestingly, the intercalation of potassium does not significantly
affect the interlayer distance of bilayer SN DDG. At the vdW-DF/DZP
level, the two layers of SN DDG are separated by an average distance
of 3.59 Å, when sulfur atoms protrude out. This value is increased
to 3.88 Å when one potassium atom is placed in the hole created
by the S and N dopants introduced in both layers. The structures are
shown in Figure 2.
In the same line, for potassium, the interaction with the two SN DDG
layers plus the interlayer interaction energy of two layers of SN
DDG is −8.59 eV. This value is 2.85 eV lower than the intercalation
energy of potassium between two layers of SN DDG. The energy forfeited
to intercalate potassium is 0.84 eV larger than that of sodium because
potassium has a larger atomic radius. Alkali intercalation is a possible
process from a thermodynamic standpoint since energy is gained when
these alkalies are inside the hole created by the dopants. For example,
when the sulfur atoms protrude out of the interlayer region, the two
layers of SN DDG are held by −2.53 eV, but after potassium
intercalation, this value decreases to −5.74 eV.

3 Conclusions
We have studied the interaction between
XY dual-doped graphene
(X = AL, Si, P, S; Y = B, N, O) and sodium/potassium by employing
periodic and finite models. The introduction of two dopants decreases
the adsorption energy of sodium and potassium with respect to that
of perfect graphene by 0.88 and 0.66 eV on average. The systems that
display the strongest interactions with the two alkalies assayed are
SN and SiB DDG. Although the adsorption energy of sodium on graphene
is weaker than that for potassium, the introduction of dopants reduces
the difference. In effect, in some cases, the AE-K and AE-NA differed
by less than 0.05 eV. The protrusion of the 3p dopants out of the
graphene plane creates a hole where sodium and potassium can be easily
intercalated between two layers of dual-doped graphene. The interlayer
distances are reduced by less than 0.4 Å after K intercalation,
making the process very favorable. The monumental rise in AE guarantees
the remarkable storage capacities at the cost of lower doping concentration,
thus preserving the extraordinary properties of graphene up to a large
extent.

4 Methods
We studied the adsorption of
sodium and potassium onto dual-doped
graphene (DDG) using two approaches. In the first place, we carried
out periodic calculations using a 5 × 5 unit cell of graphene.
Second, we performed simulations employing a graphene flake terminated
with hydrogen atoms. The molecule selected was circumcoronene (C54H18). The disposition of the dopants is the same
that employed in our previous studies for the DDG systems.28−32 In general, the 2p and 3p dopants prefer to replace a CC bond, except
in the case of SiB, which prefers a para disposition of the dopants,
as has been documented by us in ref (25). The structure is shown in Figure 1.

For the periodic calculations,
we selected the vdW-DF functional
developed by Dion et al.,44 as implemented
in SIESTA.45,46 We utilized the double-ζ
basis set (DZP) with polarization functions and fixed the orbital
confining cutoff to 0.01 Ry. The split norm used was 0.15. For all
systems, the calculations were performed with the inclusion of spin
polarization. The interaction between ionic cores and valence electrons
was described by the Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudopotentials.47 Optimizations were carried out using the conjugate
gradient algorithm until all residual forces were smaller than 0.01
eV/Å. The unit cells were optimized, and they were sampled using
a 40 × 40 × 1 (about 900 k-points γ
centered) Monkhorst–Pack sampling.

For comparative purposes,
we performed PBE-D248−50 calculations,
as implemented in VASP.51−54 The projector-augmented plane wave approach (PAW)
was selected, and the plane wave cutoff was 450Ry. The Brillouin zone
was sampled with a 7 × 7 × 1 γ centered k-point grid. For sodium and potassium, the PV PAW potentials were
utilized, which include 7 valence electrons.

The calculations
that involved the circumcoronene model were performed
using the M06-2X55,56 and PBE-D2 methods. The basis
set selected was the 6-311G*,57 and the
ultrafine grid was utilized. All systems were confirmed to be minima
by the calculations of vibrational frequencies. These calculations
were carried out with Gaussian 2009.58 We
determined the adsorption energy as follows: AE = E(graphene + X) – E(X) – E(graphene). The E(graphene + X), E(X), and E(graphene) represent the energy of the
total system, energy of Na/K, and the energy of the slab, respectively.
Zero-point energy corrections were not considered for computing AE.
According to this definition, the negative value is for favorable
interaction; a more negative value means stronger the interaction.
Hereafter, PBE-D2 refers to the results obtained using VASP and a
5 × 5 unit cell, whereas the notation PBE-D2/6-311G* is utilized
to discuss the results obtained using the circumcoronene model.
