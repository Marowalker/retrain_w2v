Inflammatory responses mediated by
the transcription factor nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
play key roles in immunity, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. NF-κB
is directly regulated through protein–protein interactions,
including those with IκB and 14-3-3 proteins. These two important
regulatory proteins have been reported to interact with each other,
although little is known about this interaction. We analyzed the inhibitor
of nuclear factor kappa B α (IκBα)/14-3-3σ
interaction via a peptide/protein-based approach. Structural data
were acquired via X-ray crystallography, while binding affinities
were measured with fluorescence polarization assays and time-resolved
tryptophan fluorescence. A high-resolution crystal structure (1.13
Å) of the uncommon 14-3-3 interaction motif of IκBα
(IκBαpS63) in a complex with 14-3-3σ was evaluated.
This motif harbors a tryptophan that makes this crystal structure
the first one with such a residue visible in the electron density
at that position. We used this tryptophan to determine the binding
affinity of the unlabeled IκBα peptide to 14-3-3 via tryptophan
fluorescence decay measurements.

Introduction
The κB-protein
family is well known for their involvement
in cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, and regulation of
the immune response.1−4 The family is divided into transcription factors, summarized as
nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB),
and their inhibitors (IκB). NF-κB is sequestered by IκB
in the cytosol, and upon activation, IκB is phosphorylated and
degraded, while NF-κB is translocated into the nucleus. The
transcriptional activity of NF-κB regulates over 500 genes,
and many of those are involved in a variety of diseases.5 The most abundant representatives of this protein
family are the heterodimer p50/p65 forming NF-κB and its inhibitor
of nuclear factor kappa B α (IκBα), which is fundamental
for the regulation of NF-κB activity.6

The most prominent regulatory pathway of IκBα
is its
phosphorylation at Ser32 and Ser36, which induces ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of IκBα.7,8 Several
studies reported IκBα as an essential component for the
inhibition of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB,9−11 with the nuclear export of the IκBα/p65 complex depending
on a third binding partner, the 14-3-3 proteins.12 Overexpression of 14-3-3 increases the IκBα
amount in the cytosol, while mutation of the possible IκBα
motifs for 14-3-3 binding leads to an increased nuclear signal for
both IκBα and NF-κB (Figure 1A).12

Figure 1 Phosphorylated
IκBα peptide bound to 14-3-3. (A) Schematic
representation of the key elements of the NF-κB pathway. In
short, upon an inflammatory signal (here represented via TNFα
and its receptor TNFR), a signaling cascade (thick dashed arrow) leads
to proteasomal degradation of IκBα and translocation of
NF-κB into the nucleus. Binding of 14-3-3 to IκBα
and NF-κB is required for either nuclear export or cytosolic
retention of the IκBα/NF-κB complex (red dashed
arrow). (B) IκBα protein consists of an unstructured N-terminus,
six helical ankyrin repeats, and the proline (P), glutamic acid (E),
serine (S), and threonine (T) rich (PEST) domain. The 14-3-3 is supposed
to bind to S63 at the unstructured N-terminal region. (C) Fluorescence
polarization (FP) with the IκBαS63 peptide and all human
14-3-3 isoforms. (D) FP with the IκBαpS63 peptide and
all human 14-3-3 isoforms.

The 14-3-3 proteins are dimeric scaffold proteins that interact
with several hundred different proteins.13 The seven human isoforms (β, γ, ε, ζ, η,
σ, and τ) are highly abundant in almost all human cells,
and they exist as homo- or heterodimers.14 The 14-3-3 monomer consists of nine helices that form an amphipathic
binding groove. By binding one or two interaction partners within
the two binding grooves of the 14-3-3 dimer, the activity or cellular
localization of the target proteins is altered.15 Interaction partners of 14-3-3 bind to 14-3-3 via distinguished
phosphorylated motives in most often unstructured regions.16

Physical interaction of 14-3-3 and IκBα
was demonstrated
by co-immunoprecipitation, whereby the truncation analysis of IκBα
suggested only one active 14-3-3 binding motif.12 This motif, 59-PRGSEPW-67, follows the 14-3-3 binding motif
RXpSXP, although phosphorylation of S63 is not yet reported. Co-immunoprecipitation
of the IκBα/14-3-3 complex in the presence and absence
of phosphatases revealed no significant differences, indicating that
the phosphorylation of this residue might not be required for binding.12 However, later studies showed that 14-3-3 binding
protects its interaction partners from phosphatases,17−19 wherefore further investigations are needed to confirm the phosphorylation
status of S63 of IκBα. Nevertheless, this region of IκBα
is most likely unstructured and therefore compatible with 14-3-3 binding.
Fortunately, the binding sequence of IκBα contains a Trp
residue at position 66. An aromatic amino acid at this position, +3
from the phosphosite, is rare within the known 14-3-3 interactome,
which makes this Trp especially interesting. It has been well documented
that Trp is an environmentally sensitive fluorophore that is able
to reflect even subtle changes in its interaction network by spectral
shifts and changes in its quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime.20−22 The specific Trp response depends on a number of intramolecular
and/or solvent interactions (e.g., Coulombic interaction, local polarity,
H-bonding, Trp mobility, etc.), all of which depend on a detailed
protein structure.23,24 Trp emission can be therefore
used for monitoring binding-induced conformational transitions and
variations of microenvironmental polarity. Generally, increased hydrophobicity
leads to blue spectral shift and prolonged fluorescence lifetime of
indole emission.25 We, therefore, utilized
Trp66 fluorescence for the detection of interaction between IκBα
peptides and the 14-3-3 protein.

In this study, the interaction
of IκBα and 14-3-3 is
characterized by a peptide-based approach. The binding of the IκBα
peptide to 14-3-3 was measured by fluorescence polarization (FP) assay
and the interface of IκBα and 14-3-3 was structurally
characterized by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, the intrinsic
fluorescence of Trp66 of the peptide was used to establish a label-free
method for the determination of binding affinities based on fluorescence
decay. Our findings expand our knowledge of the IκBα/14-3-3
interaction and further provide a technique for the characterization
of binding affinities.

Results
14-3-3 Binding Motif of
IκBα
The IκBα
protein contains only one 14-3-3 binding site, which follows a typical
14-3-3 binding motif, 57-PRGSEP-66. To investigate the binding affinity
of 14-3-3 and IκBα, two peptides were synthesized, representing
the unphosphorylated (IκBαS63) and phosphorylated (IκBαpS63)
binding motifs (Figure 1B). In both peptides, the centered Ser63 is flanked by six amino
acids on each side of the wild-type sequence of IκBα.

For the initial measurements of the binding affinities, the peptides
were N-terminally labeled with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
dye and fluorescence polarization (FP) assays were performed for both
peptides with all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms (Figure 1C,D). The unphosphorylated peptide showed
no affinity to either of the seven isoforms, whereas the phosphorylated
peptide showed binding. No peptide reached sufficient binding for
a reliable calculation of dissociation constant (KD), although differences between the isoforms were detectable.
The KD values of IκBαpS63
and 14-3-3 are expected to be in the high micromolar to millimolar
range, with the best binding to 14-3-3η and the weakest binding
to 14-3-3σ (Figure 1D).

This binding
behavior was
previously reported in the literature for peptides representing 14-3-3
binding motifs.26−28 In those cases, a second binding site was essential
for sufficient representation of the bivalent binding to the 14-3-3
dimer. Therefore, we elaborated on a hypothetical presence of additional
binding sites with the prediction server 14-3-3-Pred.29 This server analyzes the amino acid sequence of 14-3-3
interaction partners with three different methods, resulting in a
score for each method plus an overall score. The IκBα
sequence revealed only one site, pT168 (sequence: VLTQSCpT168TPHL;
Supporting Information, Table 1), as a
likely binding site. This residue is located next to the second ankyrin
repeat of the IκBα protein (Supporting Information, Figure S1), and previous truncation assays did
not reveal any effect on the 14-3-3 binding.12 Therefore, we continued with the single phosphorylated IκBαpS63
peptide only.

Crystal Structure of IκBα Peptide
with 14-3-3σ
with Truncated C-Terminus ΔC232-248 (14-3-3σΔC)
To obtain structural information on the binding interface, co-crystallization
trials were performed. The complex of IκBαpS63 with 14-3-3σΔC
was grown to the best diffracting crystals among all 14-3-3 isoforms,
allowing to solve the structure with a high resolution of 1.13 Å
(PDB ID: 6Y1J, Supporting Information, Table S2). The
crystals belonged to the space group C2221, with
one 14-3-3 monomer in the asymmetric unit. One peptide is binding
in each of the two binding grooves of the 14-3-3 dimer (Figure 2A,B). The peptide is binding
in the proximity of both tryptophan residues of 14-3-3, Trp59, and
Trp230 (Figure 2C).
In total, seven of the 13 amino acids of the peptide could be assigned
to the electron density map (Figure 2D), whereas pSer63 till Trp66 is the most rigid amino
acids with the lowest B factors (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Consistently with other 14-3-3/phosphopeptide
structures Arg56, Arg129, and Tyr130 of the protein form polar contacts
with the phospho group of IκBαpS63. Except for phosphoserine,
the only additional direct polar contact detected by Pymol software
appeared to be between Lys67 of the peptide and Glu14 of the protein
(Figure 2E). Nevertheless,
more polar contacts are mediated via waters, like Gly62 of the peptide
with Asn226 and the backbone of Leu222 of the protein, Glu64 of the
peptide and the backbone of Pro167 and Lys122 of the protein, and
the backbone of Trp66 of the peptide and Ser45 of the protein. Additionally,
there are hydrophobic contacts between Gly62 and Val178, Pro65 and
Leu218, Ile219, Leu122, and Trp66, and the aliphatic chain of Lys46
and Gly53, Lys67 and Val46 (Figure 2F).

Measurement of KD via Mean Tryptophan
Fluorescence Lifetime
The crystal structures of IκBαpS63
and 14-3-3σΔC revealed extensive contacts between the
Trp66 residue and the binding groove of 14-3-3, with the indole moiety
being located in a more hydrophobic environment. This binding mode
suggested that the mean fluorescence lifetime τmean of Trp66 might change upon peptide binding and can be therefore
used to detect the binding of the peptide without an artificial fluorescence
labeling. To separate the fluorescence of the peptide from the Trp
fluorescence of 14-3-3ζ, we made 14-3-3ζ fluorescently
silent by mutating its two tryptophan residues, Trp59 and Trp228 (equals
Trp230 in 14-3-3σ), to phenylalanine (W59F and W228F double
mutation of 14-3-3ζ (14-3-3ζnoW)). Then, only the fluorescence
of the peptide is detected.

Indeed, time-resolved fluorescence
decays clearly indicate a progressive formation of IκBαpS63/14-3-3ζnoW
complex by a significant increase of the Trp66 lifetime upon 14-3-3ζnoW
addition (Figure 3A).
This concentration-dependent increase of τmean ranges
from 3.42 ns for the IκBαpS63 alone to 4.30 ns at 763
μM 14-3-3ζnoW (Figure 3A). In contrast, the unphosphorylated IκBαS63
indicated a much weaker interaction with 14-3-3ζnoW (Figure 3B). This finding
is consistent with the results of the polarization assay shown in Figure 1. The τmean for the peptide alone was 3.04 ns, while it increased
to 3.27 ns at a maximum protein concentration of 640 μM, confirming
that the binding sequence needs to be phosphorylated for efficient
binding.

(solid) or 14-3-3ζ (dashed) to the equation described in (C).

The change in τmean due to different
protein concentrations
encouraged us to use this change for an estimation of the binding
affinity of IκBαpS63 to 14-3-3ζnoW. Therefore, τmean was plotted as a function of the 14-3-3ζnoW concentration,
which revealed a binding curve with incomplete saturation (Figure 3C). The data were
fitted to a simple 1:1 binding model resulting in a KD value of about 370 ± 50 μM for the IκBαpS63/14-3-3ζnoW
complex. It has to be noted that the KD values are slightly underestimated since the fitting model neglected
the increased quantum yield of the Trp in the complex. To validate
the obtained dissociation constant, FP assays with 14-3-3ζ and
14-3-3ζnoW were repeated with the highest possible protein concentrations
and both are labeled as IκBαS63/pS63 peptides. The FP
assay also showed incomplete saturation, but the fitting converged
to the KD of about 380 ± 1 and 415
± 30 μM for IκBα with 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ζnoW,
respectively (Figure 3D). Although the accuracy of such a fitting might be questionable,
the similarity of the fitted dissociation constants is promising.
Fortunately, due to the comparable molecular weight of the phosphorylated
and unphosphorylated peptide, the plateau of all FP curves in Figure 3D, defined by the
overall rotational diffusion of the complex, should be very similar.
This makes the comparison of KDs more
reliable.

Within the uncertainty, the fluorescence decay data
agree well
with the fluorescence polarization data, whereas both techniques revealed KD values close to 400 μM for the analogous
IκBαpS63/14-3-3ζnoW complex. Due to limits of protein
solubility, very weak interaction, and thereof inability to reach
saturation, the KD for the unphosphorylated
complex was not reliably quantifiable.

Discussion
This
study focuses on an extension of our knowledge of the IκBα
interaction with 14-3-3 and establishing label-free measurements of
dissociation constants via fluorescence decay on a difficult system.
In the first part, we could validate the 14-3-3 binding motif of IκBα
on the basis of an IκBα-peptide–14-3-3 interaction
with the traditional FP assay. The biophysical assays showed that
phosphorylation of the IκBα peptide is necessary for binding
to 14-3-3, although the rather weak binding made a quantitative determination
of affinity difficult. Regarding the bivalent binding mode due to
the two phospho-accepting pockets of the 14-3-3 dimer, this low affinity
is consistent with those of other 14-3-3 interactions. Several studies
showed similar binding behaviors for single phosphorylated peptides,
and double phosphorylated binding partners reached affinities in the
low-micromolar to the high-nanomolar range.26,27 The transition from a peptide motif to a protein domain or even
full-length protein–protein interaction is expected to considerably
enhance the binding affinity. In the case of 14-3-3 PPIs, only a few
studies succeeded in the analysis of the complex formation of full-length
domains due to the binding of 14-3-3 to unstructured regions of its
interaction partners.28,30−36 In the case of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
2 (CaMKK2), binding to 14-3-3 was established via unstructured peptide-like
motifs, which could be crystallized in a complex with 14-3-3.33 Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
and binding affinity measurements showed that additional contacts
were made with the outside of the 14-3-3 binding groove, while the
peptide-like binding conformation in the binding groove was confirmed.
Similarly, the crystal structure of the neutral trehalase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Nth1)/14-3-3 complex30 revealed that there are extensive interactions
between 14-3-3 and Nth1 beyond those involving the 14-3-3 binding
grooves. Another example of a biphosphorylated interaction partner
of 14-3-3 is procaspase-2.28 In this case,
both binding motifs were tested in fluorescence polarization assays,
whereas only one site showed μM binding. However, both phosphorylation
sites were necessary to establish a complex formation of the full-length
proteins, while no complex formation could be observed for either
single phosphorylated procaspase 2. These data suggest that an additional
binding site is necessary for efficient binding of IκBα
to 14-3-3. This can be either via a not yet identified 14-3-3 binding
site of IκBα or a third binding partner that is simultaneously
binding to IκBα and 14-3-3. A ternary complex formation
has been reported among others for the A20/RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein
kinase (C-Raf)/14-3-337 and glycogen synthase
kinase-3 β (GSK3beta)/Tau/14-3-3 interactions.38 A high-affinity binding of the second binding site might
even mediate binding of the unphosphorylated IκBαS63 motif,12 although the isolated motif needs to be phosphorylated
to show activity in binding assays. For the IκBα/14-3-3
interaction, only one active binding motif could be identified via
co-immunoprecipitation, and also the sequence analysis of the IκBα
protein revealed only one additional possible, but in the structural
context unlikely, binding site (pT168; Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1). In this case, it is
more likely that the additional binding partner NF-κB is essential
to enhance the binding of IκBα to 14-3-3. Binding of 14-3-3
to the NF-κB subunit p65 and to IκBα is needed for
sufficient export of the IκBα/NF-κB nuclear export
or retention in the cytoplasm.12

Noteworthy is also the binding mode of the IκBαpS63
peptide as Trp66 at the +3-position of the phosphorylated residue
shows a remarkable conformation. Multiple 14-3-3 binding sequences
contain aromatic residues; however, even within the constantly growing
collection of peptides crystallized in complex with 14-3-3, only a
small number contain tryptophan residues. Lately, the first crystal
structure was published with a Trp residue, which was actually covered
in electron density, located at the +1-position (Figure 4A).39 Two other examples of peptides binding to 14-3-3 and containing
a tryptophan resides are the serine/threonine-protein kinase 26 (MST4)
derived peptide (PDB ID: 5XY9) and the serine/threonine-protein kinase STK11 (LKB1)
derived peptide (PDB ID: 5WXN). The tryptophan residue of MST4 is at the +4-position
in relation to the phosphorylated residue, while that of LKB1 is at
the −4-position; however, the indol moieties of both tryptophan
residues were not visible in the electron density. That makes this
study the second one with a Trp residue visible in a 14-3-3 crystal
structure.

Figure 4 Comparison of the IκBαpS63 binding mode with other
binding 14-3-3 partners. (a) Only two interaction motifs of 14-3-3
hosting a tryptophan residue within the binding groove. All other
displayed binding modes contain at least one aromatic residues at
(b) −1-position, (c) +1-position, (d) +2-position, or (e) +3-position
in relation to the phosphorylated residue. The 14-3-3 is shown as
a white surface and the IκBαpS63 peptide as green sticks.
Other binding partners are displayed as colored sticks with the associated
PDB ID and the name of the interaction partner. For sequence comparison
and Cα distances, see Supporting Information Table S3.

The amphipathic binding
groove of 14-3-3 provides a lot of options
for aromatic residues to bind (Figure 4). Multiple structures have been published with aromatic
residues at the −1-position or +1-position of the phosphorylated
residue, where they make contacts with the hydrophobic residues of
the binding groove of 14-3-3 (Figure 4B,C).40−43 An aromatic residue at the +2-position is rare and for the structure
shown, the interaction of the yeast Nth1 domain with 14-3-3, the phenylalanine
does not make contact with 14-3-3 (Figure 4D).30 It is only
stable in the context of the full domain, which is not shown for clarity.
Actually, there is no other structure published with tryptophan at
the +3-position in addition to the IκBαpS63. However,
there are at least two structures available with a phenylalanine at
that position, whereby for one the side chain was not visible in the
electron density map (PDB ID: 6GKF; Figure 4E).44 Nevertheless, the
peptide–protein interface of myeloid leukemia factor 1 (Mfl1)
and 14-3-3ε comprises a phenylalanine at the +3-position with
the same orientation as Trp66 of IκBαpS63 (PDB ID: 3UAL; Figure 4E).45 The conformation of the binding motifs deviates C-terminally from
the phospho site more than they do N-terminally, whereas the Mfl1
motif shows the only comparable conformation. Measurements of the
distances of the Cα atoms, Trp66 of IκBα, and phenylalanine
of Mfl1 are 1.5 Å apart, while in all other structures, the residues
at the +3-position are more than 2.6 Å apart (Supporting Information Table S3). This demonstrates that not only the
binding groove in general but also the environment of the phosphorylation
site can accommodate bulky hydrophobic residues like aromatic amino
acids.

The tryptophan, clearly visible in the electron density,
offers
a nice opportunity to use its environmentally sensitive emission for
direct biophysical affinity measurements without a need for a bulky
artificial dye that could eventually bias interactions between IκBα
peptides and 14-3-3. For KD quantification,
we used the FP assay with externally labeled protein, which relies
on changed hydrodynamic properties of the complex. In parallel, we
applied intrinsic Trp fluorescence directly reflecting interaction-induced
variations of the Trp microenvironment. For our system, both methods
gave comparable results, proving the importance of the IκBα
phosphorylation and yielding KD of the
IκBαpS63/14-3-3ζnoW complex formation in the 10–4 M range.

Future research will further evaluate
the binding of IκBα/p65
to 14-3-3 and analyze the contribution of this complex regarding the
nuclear export mechanism of IκBα and p65.

Materials and
Methods
Peptide Synthesis
Peptides were synthesized via Fmoc-solid-phase
peptide synthesis with an automated Intavis MultiPep RSi peptide synthesizer
with a Rink amide AM resin (Novabiochem; 0.59 mmol/g loading). After
the synthesis was completed, the resin was split, with half of the
peptide N-terminally acetylated (1:1:3 acetic anhydride (Ac2O)/pyridine/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)) and the
other one isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled via a β-alanine linker
as described above.46 The peptides were
cleaved with a 2.5:2.5:2.5:92.5 EDT/TIS/MQ/TFA mixture and purified
with a preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) system with mass spectrometry (MS) detection (Supporting Information, Figure S3). The purified peptide was lyophilized
and stored at −30 °C.

14-3-3 Expression
The 14-3-3 isoforms were transiently
expressed in Escherichia coli Nico21(DE3)
or BL21(DE3) competent cells via a pPROEX HTb plasmid. The cells were
grown to a density of OD600 = 0.8–1, and protein
expression was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) for 18 h by 18 °C. The proteins were purified following
standard procedures for Ni-affinity chromatography. For crystallography,
the His6-Tag was removed by TEV cleavage and an additional Ni-NTA
column, followed by size-exclusion chromatography ensuring the highest
purity. All proteins were dialyzed against 25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (Hepes) pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine,
and stored at −80 °C. The exact mass of the proteins was
confirmed via hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) measurements,
whereby the number of peaks in the chromatogram indicated the purity
of the protein (Supporting Information, Figure S4).

Crystallography
14-3-3σΔC232-248
and IκBαS63/pS63
complexes were mixed in a ratio of 1:2 in a final protein concentration
of 12 mg/mL in crystallography buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated overnight at
4 °C. In a hanging drop approach, the peptide/protein complex
was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a precipitation buffer (0.95 mM Hepes
pH 7.1, 28% PEG400, 5% glycerol, 0.19 M CaCl2), crystals
grew within one week. The crystals could be directly fished and flash-cooled
in liquid nitrogen. The data set was measured at the Synchrotron DESY
beamline P11, Hamburg, Germany.

For the indexing, integration,
and molecular replacement, the CCP4 suite47 was used (iMosflm,48 Aimless,49,50 and MolRep51,52). As a search model for molecular
replacement, PDB ID code 4FR3 was used. The refinement was done with phenix53 and the model building in Coot.54

Fluorescence Polarization (FP) Assay
The FP was measured
with FITC-labeled peptides at a final concentration of 100 nM in fluorescence
polarization buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween
20, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA)). The 14-3-3 isoforms were
titrated as indicated. All data sets were measured in at least three
independent experiments in Corning black round-bottom 384-well plates
with a Tecan Infinite F500 plate reader (excitation 485 nm, emission
535 nm).

Time-Resolved Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements
Measurements of time-resolved Trp emission were performed on an apparatus
comprised of a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II;
Coherent) with the repetition rate reduced to 4 MHz by a pulse picker
(APE). The fluorescence signal was collected using time-correlated
single-photon counting detection SPC150 (Becker&Hickl) with a
cooled MCP-PMT (R3809U-50; Hamamatsu). Trp fluorescence was excited
at 298 nm by a tripled output of the laser and the emission was isolated
under the “magic angle” conditions at 355 nm using a
combination of a monochromator and a stack of UG1 and BG40 glass filters
(Thorlabs) placed in front of the input slit. Fluorescence decays
were typically accumulated in 1024 channels with a time resolution
of 50 ps/channel until 105 counts in the decay maximum were reached.
All experiments were performed at 23 °C in a buffer containing
20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The IκBαS63/pS63
peptide and 14-3-3ζnoW concentrations were 1 and 0–763
μM, respectively. Fluorescence decays were analyzed by the model-independent
maximum entropy method55 allowing accurate
determination of the mean fluorescence lifetime τmean, calculated as τmean = ∑αi τi2/∑αiτi, where τi and αi are the fluorescence
lifetime components and the corresponding amplitudes revealed by the
analysis, respectively.
