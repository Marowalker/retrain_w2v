An
important strategy in the construction of biomimetic membranes
and devices is to use natural proteins as the functional components
for incorporation in a polymeric or nanocomposite matrix. Toward this
goal, an important step is to immobilize proteins with high efficiency
and precision without disrupting the protein function. Here, we developed
a dual-functional tag containing histidine and the non-natural amino
acid azidohomoalanine (AHA). AHA is metabolically incorporated into
the protein, taking advantage of the Met-tRNA and Met-tRNA synthetase.
Histidine in the tag can facilitate metal-affinity purification, whereas
AHA can react with an alkyne-functionalized probe or surface via well-established
click chemistry. We tested the performance of the tag using two model
proteins, green fluorescence protein and an enzyme pyrophosphatase.
We found that the addition of the tag and the incorporation of AHA
did not significantly impair the properties of these proteins, and
the histidine–AHA tag can facilitate protein purification,
immobilization, and labeling.

Introduction
Proteins are functional materials created
by nature to execute
diverse activities in living organisms. The superb selectivity, specificity,
and performance of proteins have made them highly desirable components
in the creation of biomimetic materials. A major obstacle in the utilization
of proteins in biotechnology is the difficulty with site-specific
immobilization of proteins without compromising their functions. Introduction
of a peptide tag has been a popular method to facilitate protein immobilization
or detection. Such peptide tags include the GST tag,1,2 strep tag,3−5 HA tag,6,7 flag tag,8−10 arg tag,11,12 c-myc tag,13,14 and His-tag.15,16 Proteins bearing these tags can
be captured or detected via interactions with their corresponding
binding-partner modules or antibodies. Peptide tags are usually directly
encoded into the gene of the target protein and thus have the advantage
of being convenient and highly specific. Although they are very useful
in the purification and detection of the tagged proteins, the application
of most peptide tags in protein immobilization and modification is
limited by the noncovalent nature of the interaction, which suffers
from drawbacks including a high off-rate and low mechanical resilience.
Several systems have been developed to promote the formation of covalent
bonds between a residue in the peptide tag and its catcher module,
such as split inteins,17 the SpyTag/SpyCatcher,18−20 cysteine and α-chloroacetyl interaction facilitated by the
coil–coil interaction,21 the His-tag
and nitrilotriacetate-based arylazide photoreactive label via click
chemistry,22,23 and the use of the substrate
peptide of a ligase or transferase, such as the LAP tag,24 the Q tag,25 the
sortagging motif,26 the formyl glycine
tag,27 and the peptides A1 and S6.28

Incorporation of non-natural amino acids
is another useful technique
used in the site-specific modification of proteins. Examples include
the azido- or alkyne-containing residues via click chemistry,29 norbornene-containing residues that react with
tetrazine-based probes,30 and p-azido-l-phenoalanine via photocatalytic reaction.31 Non-natural amino acids are usually introduced
into the protein of interest through the introduction of a dedicated
orthogonal pair of tRNA and tRNA synthetase that translate a stop
codon (typically TAG) into the specific non-natural amino acid. Recently,
this method has been coupled with in situ biosynthesis to incorporate
a sulfur-containing noncanonical amino acid, S-allyl-l-cysteine, into Escherichia coli proteins.32 Subsequently, the non-natural
amino acid can introduce unique chemistry to facilitate site-specific
modification. Alternatively, if the structure of a non-natural amino
acid is very similar to that of a natural amino acid, it can be incorporated
metabolically using the corresponding auxotrophic strain. In this
case, no additional cellular machineries need to be introduced. For
example, azidohomoalanine (AHA) can be incorporated into the sequence
of proteins by Met-tRNA and tRNA synthetase (Figure 1A). This method has been used by several
groups to label and modify proteins.33−43 However, labeling of the incorporated AHAs often suffers from poor
efficiency because methionine residues usually form part of the hydrophobic
core of a protein and thus have limited accessibility to reactions.
Although all proteins contain methionine (and thus the ATG codon for
AHA incorporation) in their amino acid sequences, only a small percentage
of these residues seemed to be accessible for labeling. One potential
solution is to denature and unfold the target protein before labeling
to improve the accessibility of the AHA residues.29,44 This approach is very useful in the detection of a target protein
but not suitable for applications that demand active proteins. Otherwise,
the residue can be introduced at the surface of the protein via site-directed
mutagenesis.38 Here, we take advantage
of the convenience of metabolic incorporation and address the issue
of limited accessibility through the genetic introduction of a tag
containing the ATG codon. To avoid the formation of a hydrophobic
patch that may potentially affect protein folding, we inserted polar
residues (histidine or serine) between neighboring Met/AHA residues.
The tag has two functions: histidine in the tag can facilitate protein
purification via the conventional metal-affinity chromatography, whereas
methionine (or rather, its replacement by AHA) can be used in covalent
labeling. The performance of the tags was evaluated using two model
proteins, superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) and inorganic
pyrophosphatase from Staphylococcus aureus (PpaC).45 sfGFP was chosen owing to its
intrinsic fluorescence, whereas PpaC was chosen because its enzymatic
activity can be conveniently measured using a colorimetric assay.
Using these two model proteins, we demonstrated that the incorporation
of the tag did not compromise the function of proteins, and the tag
could facilitate both protein purification and modification. We expect
the dual-functional His–AHA tag to be useful in general for
various biotechnological applications.

Results and Discussion
Incorporation of AHA into the Target Proteins
Expression
of AHA-containing proteins was performed using a methionine auxotrophic
strain, DL41(DE3). DL41(DE3) could
not grow in the absence of methionine (Figure 2A). The replacement of Met by AHA slowed
down the growth of the strain and increased the doubling time at the
exponential growth phase from 1 to 2 h, but the two cultures grew
to similar densities at saturation. This result indicates that AHA
can be used effectively as a replacement of methionine in the synthesis
of proteins and supports cell growth. To further confirm that AHA
was incorporated to replace methionine, we submitted AHA-containing
PpaC-H6G3M4 (Table 1) for mass spectroscopy peptide fingerprinting analysis. There are
13 methionine residues in the protein, including four in the tag.
Among them, the peptide containing AHA-substituted Met1, Met125, or
M142 was not detected. Peptides containing AHA replacement of all
10 other methionine residues were identified, indicating that these
residues were at least partially replaced by AHA.

Incorporation of a Dual-Functional
Tag at the C-Terminus of
sfGFP
The intrinsic fluorescence of sfGFP makes it a popular
model protein in studies involving protein modification, including
ones using the azido-alkyne-based click chemistry.50 The polyhistidine tag has been used extensively in the
purification of sfGFP.51 Here, we have
tested two different tag designs, with the addition of two or four
methionine residues (Figure 1 and Table 1). To avoid the potential creation of a hydrophobic patch, we juxtaposed
methionine with histidine. For protein expression, E. coli strain DL41(DE3) containing
the plasmid sfGFP-H6, sfGFP-H7M2, or sfGFP-H6M4 was grown in the M9
medium supplemented with 20 essential amino acids, as described in
the Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 1C, the different
tags did not affect the expression level of the protein. The two proteins
containing methionine residues in the tag can be purified similarly
as that of the His-tagged sfGFP, with similar yields and purity (data
not shown).

To examine the potential effect of the tag and the
replacement of methionine by AHA on the protein structure, we measured
the fluorescence spectra of the three proteins, sfGFP-H6, sfGFP-H7M2,
and sfGFP-H6M4, containing methionine or AHA. After expression and
purification, the fluorescence spectra of the protein samples were
collected (Figure 2B). Six protein samples were examined, including the three different
constructs of sfGFP expressed in the presence of either methionine
or AHA. The wavelength of the emission peak was not affected by the
addition of the tags or the incorporation of AHA. For each construct,
the replacement of methionine by AHA did not affect the fluorescence
intensity. The fluorescence intensity of sfGFP-H6M4 was approximately
10% lower than that of sfGFP-H6 and sfGFP-H7M2.

Then, we examined
the effect of the Met-containing tag in promoting
the efficiency of a click-chemistry reaction. Purified sfGFP bearing
H6, H7M2, or H6M4 tag was subjected to labeling using biotin alkyne
followed by detection using antibiotin western blot (WB). As shown
in Figure 3A, the level
of labeling of sfGFP-H6M4 was significantly better than that of sfGFP-H7M2,
which was also better than that of sfGFP-H6. The relative levels of
labeling of H6M4 and H7M2 were approximately 10- and 3-fold, respectively,
as the level of sfGFP-H6. There are three intrinsic methionine residues
in sfGFP, as highlighted in Figure 1B. The side chain of these methionine residues is likely
involved in hydrophobic interactions in the native structure of sfGFP.
Therefore, when
AHA replaces these methionine residues, its side chains likely have
limited accessibility for the reaction.

Figure 3 (A) Coomassie blue (CB)
stain and anti-biotin WB analysis of three
AHA-containing sfGFP constructs reacted with biotin alkyne. (B) Alkyne
agarose resin incubated with sfGFP-H6M4 expressed with methionine
and then imaged using normal white light (left) or blue light (right).
(C) Alkyne agarose resin incubated with sfGFP-H6M4 expressed with
AHA and then imaged using normal white light (left) or blue light
(right).

To demonstrate the usefulness
of the tag in facilitating immobilization,
we expressed sfGFP-H6M4 in the presence of AHA or methionine and incubated
the alkyne agarose resin with purified proteins. After washing, images
of the modified resin under normal white light or blue light (Figure 3B,C) were taken.
It is clear that the reaction with the alkyne agarose resin depends
on the presence of AHA in the protein. The immobilization of AHA-containing
sfGFP-H6M4 is highly specific. AHA-containing sfGFP-H6M4 readily attached
to the alkyne beads, whereas no binding could be detected for sfGFP-H6M4
expressed in the absence of AHA.

Addition of the GS3M4 Tag
to PpaC
We used PpaC as a
model enzyme to further examine the performance of the methionine-containing
tag. Here, we added an octapeptide “GMSMSMSM” after
the His-tag at the C-terminus of PpaC (Table 1). PpaC is a good model enzyme because the
protein can be expressed and purified at high yields, and its catalytic
activity can be measured using a convenient colorimetric assay. We
have previously determined the crystal structure of PpaC-H6.45 It exists as a dimer, and each subunit contains
nine intrinsic methionine residues (Figure 4A).

in the dimer are color-coded. Methionine residues in the structure

Michaelis–Menten equation to determine KM and kcat. (C) CB stain and anti-biotin

Each experiment was repeated three times. The average value and standard
deviations are shown.

To examine the effect of the tag and the incorporation of
AHA on
the catalytic activity of PpaC, we first compared the catalytic activity
of PpaC-H6 and PpaC-H6GS3M4 expressed in DL41(DE3) grown in the presence of methionine (Figure 4B, black and red). The fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation yielded KM and kcat of 44 ± 9 μM and 887 ± 97 μmol·min–1·mg–1, respectively, for PpaC-H6GS3M4,
which are not significantly different from the KM and kcat of PpaC-H6 (52 ±
15 μM and 897 ± 98 μmol·min–1·mg–1, respectively). Next, we compared KM and kcat of PpaC-H6GS3M4
expressed with AHA (Figure 4B, red and blue). KM and kcat of the protein expressed from cells grown
in the presence of AHA are 43 ± 11 μM and 1050 ± 101
μmol·min–1·mg–1. Differences in KM and kcat between the AHA-containing PpaC and non-AHA-containing
PpaC are not statistically significant.

To compare the level
of labeling of PpaC-H6 and PpaC-H6GS3M4, we
expressed the two proteins in the presence of AHA as described. Although
each PpaC subunit contains nine intrinsic methionine residues, the
level of labeling of PpaC-H6 was much lower than the level of labeling
of PpaC-H6GS3M4 (Figure 4C). Although similar amounts of proteins were used in the experiment,
the band intensity of PpaC-H6GS3M4 in the anti-biotin WB was approximately
four times the band intensity of PpaC-H6. In spite of the abundance
of the intrinsic methionine, the addition of an ATG-encoding tag greatly
improved the efficiency of modification.

Finally, we examined
the usefulness of the AHA-containing tag in
the immobilization of PpaC. PpaC-H6GS3M4 expressed in the presence
of methionine or AHA was incubated with alkyne agarose resin for immobilization
as described in Materials and Methods. After
immobilization, the resin was washed to remove free proteins, and
the PpaC activity of proteins attached to the resin was measured (Figure 4D). For control,
the alkyne agarose resin was incubated in the presence of bovine serum
albumin (BSA). The activity of immobilized PpaC-H6GS3M4 was measured,
as described in Materials and Methods. Without
AHA, there was a low level of adsorption of PpaC-H6GS3M4 to the agarose
resin, leading to a low level of activity. When AHA was incorporated
into the structure of PpaC, the level of activity increased approximately
8-fold, indicting more efficient immobilization. The control sample
with BSA displayed no detectable activity.

In summary, we have
shown that AHA-containing tags introduced at
the C-terminus of two model proteins significantly increased the efficiency
of the click chemistry reaction. The design of the tag is flexible.
We tested three sequences, with two, three, or four extra ATG codons,
in the tag. All of them significantly increased the level of labeling
when the AHA-containing proteins were reacted with biotin alkyne.
When combined with a polyhistidine tag, the histidine–AHA tag
can facilitate both noncovalent interactions such as metal-affinity
purification and covalent binding via reactions with the alkyne functional
group. We avoided the incorporation of multiple Met/AHA residues in
a continuous stretch to avoid the potential problem of creating a
hydrophobic patch, which may interfere with protein folding. Other
than that, the design of the tag is really very flexible. The versatility
of the tag design makes the concept broadly useful in the development
of strategies to label and modify various proteins and immobilize
proteins onto diverse alkyne-functionalized supporting matrices. A
limitation of this method is the compatibility of the tag with specific
protein structures. Although, in most cases, a short peptide tag as
described in this study is not expected to drastically affect the
structure and function of the protein of interest, there is always
a possibility that certain proteins cannot tolerate such modifications.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid Construction
Plasmids pET22-sfGFP
and pET22-PpaC
were created as described in earlier studies.45,46 C-terminal tags were introduced via the fast cloning method using
pET22-sfGFP or pET22-PpaC as the template, and primers are listed
in Table 1.47 All coding sequences were confirmed through
DNA sequencing.

AHA Incorporation into Target Protein
For protein expression,
the corresponding plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain DL41(DE3). Single colonies were first cultured
overnight at 37 °C in M9 medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/L),
and then the Met-starved overnight culture was used to inoculate 30
mL of fresh M9 medium containing 19 essential amino acids (each at
40 μg/mL without methionine) and 50 μg/mL of AHA with
10-fold dilution. The cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking
at 250 rpm until its absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.8, and
then the cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG).
After overnight expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 8000 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C.
Control proteins with
normal methionine in the tag were expressed the same as described
except for replacing 50 μg/mL of AHA with 40 μg/mL of
methionine in the culture medium.

Protein Purification
For purification, the cell pellet
was resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 for PpaC or 20 mM phosphate, 200
mM NaCl, pH 7.5 for sfGFP). The protease inhibitor phenylmethane sulfonyl
fluoride was added freshly to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The
cells were lysed through sonication and then centrifuged at 10 000
rpm, 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated
with Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) for 40 min at 4 °C with shaking.
The resin was then loaded into an empty column, drained, and washed
with the corresponding lysis buffer supplemented with 40 mM imidazole.
Finally, proteins were eluted using the corresponding lysis buffer
supplemented with 500 mM imidazole. After purification, imidazole
in the samples was removed by dialysis against the lysis buffer.

Bacteria Growth Curve
DL41(DE3) strain
was cultured overnight in M9 medium supplemented with 20 essential
amino acids. The next morning, the overnight culture was used to inoculate
three cultures of M9 medium supplemented with 19 essential amino acids
(each at 40 μg/mL, no methionine) plus AHA (50 μg/mL),
with 19 amino acids (each at 40 μg/mL, no methionine), or with
all 20 essential amino acids (each at 40 μg/mL). Cell growth
was measured by monitoring the absorbance of the cell cultures at
600 nm (OD600) at the indicated time.

Protein Biotinylation via
Click Chemistry
The reactivity
of AHA residues in the structure of sfGFP and PpaC was examined through
their reaction with PEG4 carboxamide-propargyl biotin (biotin alkyne).
To initiate the reaction, biotin alkyne (50 μM), tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl) methyl]amine (TBTA, 600 μM),
and CuBr (600 μM) were added into the purified protein sample
in the HEPES buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature
with shaking for 5 min for sfGFP constructs and 1 h for PpaC constructs
and then analyzed using anti-biotin WB.

Protein Immobilization
to Alkyne Agarose Resin
Alkyne
agarose resins were purchased from Jena Bioscience. The alkyne agarose
beads were first washed with 10 bed volume of HEPES buffer (20 mM
HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) three times and then resuspended in 2
bed volume of HEPES buffer containing the indicated protein. TBTA
was added to a final concentration of 600 μM followed by mixing
using a pipette tip. CuBr was then added to a final concentration
of 200 μM. The reaction mixture was mixed thoroughly using the
pipette tip and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the
beads were washed using 10 bed volume of HEPES buffer via centrifugation
three times.

Gel Electrophoresis and WB
Sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was preformed using 20% tris–glycine
gel. For WB, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane after SDS-PAGE and detected using a monoclonal antibiotin
antibody–alkaline phosphatase conjugate.

Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
Fluorescence emission spectra
were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) at 20 °C at an excitation wavelength
of 485 nm.

Fluorescent images were taken using a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY).

PpaC Activity Assay
The PPase activity was measured
using Mn pyrophosphate as the substrate as described.48 Stock solutions of MnCl2 and sodium pyrophosphate
were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio at 0.5 mM right before the analysis
(mixing an equal volume of 1.0 mM MnCl2 and 1.0 mM sodium
pyrophosphate) and diluted to the indicated substrate concentration
for the activity measurement. At neutral pH, pyrophosphate is not
fully deprotonated. The major species is MnH2PPi (MnPPi),
which was considered to be the substrate for PpaC.49 A stock solution of malachite green (0.12%, w/v) was made
by dissolving the dye in 3 M sulfuric acid. A working solution was
always prepared fresh by adding one volume of 7.5% (w/v) ammonium
molybdate into four volumes of the malachite green stock solution
followed by the addition of Tween 20, to a final concentration of
0.2% (v/v). This solution is used to both terminate the enzyme reaction
and initiate the colorimetric reaction to determine the concentration
of phosphates. For activity measurements, PpaC was added into a freshly
prepared reaction mixture containing the indicated concentration of
MnPPi, in a reaction buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) at
room temperature for 5 min. To terminate the enzymatic reaction and
determine the phosphate concentration of a sample, one volume of the
working solution was mixed with four volumes of the enzymatic reaction
mixture to be analyzed. For immobilized PpaC, the reaction mixture
was subjected to a quick centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected
for analysis. The mixture was incubated for 5 min for the color to
develop, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured. We have experimented
with the conditions and confirmed that under these conditions, the
product phosphate accumulation over time was linear.
Therefore, the absorbance at 630 nm, after correction for background,
directly correlates with the rate of hydrolysis. Michaelis–Menten
constant KM and specific enzymatic activity
were determined through fitting the measured values using SigmaPlot.
