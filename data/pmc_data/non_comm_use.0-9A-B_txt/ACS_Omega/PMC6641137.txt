The
use of achiral surfactant assemblies as a reaction platform
for an alkylation reaction resulted in a high enantiomeric excess.
Dilauryldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) vesicles were modified with
cholesterol to promote alkylation of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester (DMGBE) with benzyl bromide, resulting
in high conversion (∼90%) and high enantioselectivity (up to
80%). The R-enantiomer was formed on using the DDAB
vesicles, whereas the use of phospholipid liposomes prepared from
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) produced
an excess of the S-enantiomer. Considering the chemical
structures of the reaction substrates and amphiphiles as well as the
membrane structures and properties of DDAB vesicles and DOPC liposomes,
it is suggested that the enantiomeric excesses result from the location
of the quaternary amine of the amphiphiles and the DMGBE at the outer
surface of the membrane. We show that the enantioselective reaction
at the surface of the self-assembly could be regulated by adjusting
the chemical structures and resulting membrane properties of the self-assembly.

Introduction
C—C bond formation
reactions are fundamental in many areas,
like petrochemicals, materials science, and pharmaceutical chemistry.1−3 Enantioselective C—C bond formations have attracted much
attention from many scientists because these reactions can be an important
tool for synthesizing pharmaceutical chemicals. There have been many
reports on the development of chemical processes to obtain products
enantioselectively, mostly focusing on the design of catalysts.4−6 However, conventional enantioselective reactions need to be carried
out in organic solvents as reaction media and have several reaction
steps for synthesizing catalysts, which require additional energy
for the whole reaction process. Therefore, there is a demand for enantioselective
reaction processes that function in aqueous media.

Some difficulties
must be overcome to achieve enantioselective
reactions in water. Recently, powerful phase-transfer catalysts have
been developed for enantioselective alkylation, utilizing the interface
between the aqueous and organic phases.7−9 However, many catalysts
are unable to work in aqueous media; only a few metallic catalysts
show activity in highly polar environments10 and many organic reactants do not dissolve in water. Many efforts
have been made to synthesize designed catalysts because of difficulties
such as low yields and a lack of catalyst versatility because the
mechanisms of the enantioselective reactions are unclear. Instead,
regulation of the nature of the interface between aqueous and organic
phases may positively affect interfacial reactions and improve the
understanding of the mechanism of these reactions.

Self-assembling
systems such as micelles, vesicles, and nanotubes
can provide the microenvironment of an organic phase within aqueous
media, in which reactions between organic species can occur.11−13 It has also been reported that liposomes can be utilized as a platform
for chemical processes that can achieve separation and conversion
of reactants in aqueous media.16,17 Our previous reports
have shown that liposome membranes could enhance the enantioselective
alkylation of an amino acid derivative.18 In the previous report, it has also been revealed that the chirality
of the product is independent of the chirality of the lipids (l-form or d-form) used for construction of the platform,
suggesting that regulation of the reaction environment is more important
than the chirality of the molecules. Assuming that the ability to
localize reactants within the bilayer of a liposome is an essential
requirement for a successful enantioselective reaction, a vesicle
composed of achiral surfactants can also be used as a platform for
an enantioselective reaction. Previous reports have shown that some
reactions are enhanced with surfactants at the water–organic
solvent interface23 or with surfactants
self-assembled as micelles, which act to enrich the concentration
of reactants at the self-assembly surface.14,15 It has also been reported that vesicles can be constructed using
surfactants and surfactant vesicles can also work as a platform for
some reaction processes.19 Although these
reports showed good examples of reactions with high yields, the possibility
that achiral surfactants could work as catalysts for enantioselective
reactions has never been suggested. Therefore, it would be very valuable
if an enantioselective reaction can be carried out without chiral
catalysts. Herein, for the first time, we propose an enantioselective
reaction system with vesicles of dilauryldimethylammonium bromide
(DDAB), which contains a quaternary ammonium moiety to enhance the
reaction and no asymmetric carbon atom. The reaction of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester (DMGBE)
with benzyl bromide utilizing DDAB vesicles is investigated for the
ability of vesicles constructed from achiral molecules to produce
an enantioselective product and to reveal the mechanism of obtaining
enantioselectivity. Further, we compared the surface properties of
a DDAB vesicle with those of other self-assembling systems (liposomes
and micelles, Figure 1) to investigate a possible reaction model that regulates the observed
conversion and enantioselectivity.

Figure 1 Top: Illustrations of liposome, vesicle,
and micelle. Bottom: chemical
structures of DDAB, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DPPC), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). A liposome is constituted
of natural amphiphilies (often phospholipids, such as DOPC and DPPC),
and in this study, vesicles composed of synthetic, non-natural amphiphiles
(such as DDAB) are called “vesicles”. CTAB is used for
the formation of micelles.

Results and Discussion
We have previously reported that
the alkylation of DMGBE can be
achieved (conversion >90%) at a low enantiomeric excess (e.e. ≈ 5%) in a CTAB micelle solution, whereas a
higher e.e. value (>90%) could be obtained in
a DOPC liposome suspension.18 DDAB was
selected as an amphiphile that can
form vesicles in an aqueous solution and possesses a tertiary ammonium
group that is located on the hydrophilic side of the membrane.20 Alkylation of DMGBE was carried out in a suspension
of DDAB vesicles, as shown in Scheme 1. This reaction showed a high conversion rate (∼90%)
and medium enantioselectivity (e.e. ≈ −50%)
based on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatogram
obtained using a chiral column (Figure 2, Table 1). Most importantly, the (R)-product was formed with the DDAB vesicles.
The (R)-product was also obtained by using the phase-transfer catalyst,8 whereas the (S)-product was formed in excess
in the presence of DOPC liposomes.18 The
size-effect of the DDAB vesicles was also examined, but no significant
differences in conversion and e.e. were observed,
indicating that the formation of the vesicles was an important factor
for the reaction. When the DDAB vesicles were modified with 20% cholesterol,
the e.e. values increased compared to those of the
unmodified DDAB vesicles, reaching approximately −80%. The
reactants were added to the DDAB vesicle suspension in different orders
to examine the effect of partitioning of the reactants in the DDAB
vesicle membrane. Insertion of benzyl bromide into the DDAB vesicle
membrane prior to the addition of DMGBE resulted in the formation
of the (R)-product, with an e.e. value that reached
−56%. These results support the theory that benzyl bromide
can be oriented in the deeper region of the DDAB vesicle membrane
and can react with the DMGBE molecule at the outer surface of the
membrane.

The conformation of DMGBE during
its interaction with the DDAB
vesicle membrane should differ from that on interaction with the DOPC
liposome membrane, as previously reported.18 The physicochemical properties of the membrane are important to
the outcome of a reaction on the membrane of either a vesicle or a
liposome. The surface properties of various self-assemblies were analyzed
using the previously reported method21,22 to investigate
the differences between the DOPC liposomes, CTAB micelles, and DDAB
vesicles. The fluorescent probes 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylamino naphthalene
(Laurdan) and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) have been used to
evaluate the membrane polarity and fluidity, respectively.21 The spectrum of Laurdan is strongly related
to the hydration environment of the Laurdan embedded in the membrane:
the spectrum of Laurdan is blue-shifted when its environment is dehydrated.22 Therefore, the surface characteristics of the
self-assembling system can be distinguished from those of others by
analyzing the fluorescence spectra of Laurdan. Laurdan shows a peak
at 440 nm when embedded in vesicles with a solid-ordered (so) phase, at 490 nm when in vesicles with liquid-disordered
(ld) phase, and at 505 nm for micelles. Figure 3 shows the fluorescence
spectra of Laurdan embedded in a typical liposome (phospholipid vesicle),
micelle, and a DDAB vesicle. The fluorescence spectrum of Laurdan
in the presence of a DDAB vesicle indicates that the DDAB membrane
has quite different characteristics from those of a micelle, showing
it to be more hydrated than typical ld phase vesicles. The membrane polarity can be analyzed in detail
by calculation of its GP340 values; vesicles
in the so phase (such as DPPC liposomes)
showed high GP340 values of ∼0.4,
whereas the GP340 values were about −0.3
for ld phase vesicles, such as DOPC liposomes
(Figure S1a). The GP340 value for a micelle was much lower (GP340 < −0.7), indicating that the micelle surface
is a hydrated environment. The DDAB vesicles also showed low GP340 values (GP340 ∼ −0.6), indicating that DDAB vesicles also form highly
hydrated environments, such as those found in micelles. These results
were also proved by the evaluation of the membrane fluidity, which
was analyzed by the fluorescent probe DPH (Figure S1b). The membrane fluidity (1/P) of the DDAB
vesicles was much higher than that of conventional vesicles (such
as DOPC liposomes).

The addition of benzyl bromide to the DDAB
vesicle caused the fluorescence
spectrum of Laurdan and the value of GP340 to vary (Figure 3b,c), whereas the addition of benzyl bromide to the DOPC liposome
did not change its membrane properties. The membrane of the DDAB vesicle
changed to a more “ordered” structure through its interaction
with benzyl bromide, indicating that the hydrophobic molecules, used
as reaction substrates, can change the membrane properties of DDAB
vesicles. In addition, modification of the DDAB vesicle membrane with
cholesterol also resulted in a similar variation of the membrane,
as seen for benzyl bromide. These findings indicate that the membrane
properties of the DDAB vesicles can be regulated by the addition of
hydrophobic molecules. However, DDAB vesicles modified with either
benzyl bromide or cholesterol had more polar environments than those
of the liposomes, indicating that the DDAB vesicles act as a platform
different from those of liposomes. This finding can be taken as an
explanation for the observed variations in the enantioselectivity
of reactions on using these platforms.

system. (b) DDAB vesicle, (c) DDAB vesicle + benzyl bromide, and (d)
DDAB/cholesterol = 80:20 vesicle. The lines indicate the experimental
result (black), fitted line (red), spectral fraction of the ordered
phase (blue), and spectral fraction of the disordered phase (green).

The dependence of enantioselective
alkylation of DMGBE on the membrane
properties of the self-assemblies was studied by direct comparison
of the obtained results (Figure 4). The conversion values were plotted against the GP340 values, showing an approximately linear
relationship (Figure 4a). It can be clearly seen that the self-assembling systems that
showed lower (more negative) GP340 values
could enhance the conversion in the reaction. The reason for this
enhancement is probably related to the adsorption of the reactants
onto the surface (membrane) of the self-assembling system. Our previous
reports have shown that the self-assembly systems with lower GP340 values could attract a greater number of
hydrophobic substrates due to the exposure of the hydrophobic interior
of the vesicle membrane.16 The adsorption
behavior of the reactants was also investigated in this study. It
was found that a greater quantity of reactants was adsorbed onto the
self-assemblies with lower GP340 values
(Figure 4a). The adsorption
of DMGBE was strongly related to the conversion, indicating that the
interaction between DMGBE and self-assembly was an important factor
for the reaction. Although the e.e. values were low
(∼5%) in the presence of systems with lower GP340 values, such as CTAB micelles, some liposomes that
showed higher GP340 values achieved high
enantioselectivity (e.e. ∼90%; Figure 4b). The conversion and enantioselectivity
were, respectively, suppressed and increased to some extent when benzyl
bromide was inserted into the DDAB vesicle prior to DMGBE addition.
This effect was probably because of the associated change in the GP340 value. These findings revealed the importance
of the properties of self-assembling systems in highly effective reactions
on the surface of self-assemblies.

and DPPC (labeled 4 and 6, respectively) were from ref (18).

We suggest that the reaction model for enantioselective alkylation
at the surface of self-assemblies is also related to the membrane
properties and chemical structures of the reactants and amphiphiles.
As previously reported in phase-transfer catalysis, the Si face of DMGBE tends to interact with and be covered by the hydrophobic
region of the catalyst, which resulted in the formation of (R)-form
enantiomers.8 On applying this tendency
to the DDAB vesicle system, the Si face of DMGBE
faces toward the hydrophobic region of the DDAB vesicle and is hindered
by the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between DDAB and
DMGBE. The DDAB–DMGBE complex formed shows high hydrophobicity
on the basis of its chemical structure, and the complex can enter
into a deeper area of the DDAB vesicle to form stronger hydrophobic
interactions (Figure 5). As a result, benzyl bromide only can react with the Re face of DMGBE, which can produce the (R)-form of the product. This
simple interaction between DDAB and DMGBE could be supported by the
time required to accomplish the reaction. It took only a short time
(within a few hours) to complete the reaction as compared to that
for the reaction with the DOPC liposome. DOPC and DMGBE might form
complicated reaction intermediates via multiple forces, such as (i)
electrostatic interactions, (ii) hydrophobic interactions, and (iii)
hydrogen bonds of both molecules at the interface. In our previous
report, multiple interactions were suggested to be induced in the
case of chiral adsorption of l-amino acids onto the phospholipid
membrane surface, in which an induction time is needed to obtain “mature”
interactions at the liposome surface.17 Similarly, the multiple interactions between the DMGBE and DOPC
molecules are thought to be rather complicated and therefore it could
require more than several hours to form an appropriate reaction intermediate
to obtain the chiral ((S)-form) product (Figure S3). The difference in interactions is considered to have varied
the covered plain face of DMGBE, which results in the production of
opposite enantiomers.

Figure 5 Reaction model of the enantioselective alkylation of DMGBE
(shown
in its depronated form) on the surface of a DDAB vesicle membrane.
In this figure, the Re face of DMGBE is on the top
(outside of the vesicle membrane) and the Si face
is at the bottom (inside of the vesicle membrane).

On modification of the DDAB vesicle with cholesterol,
the value
of GP340 increased, as mentioned above,
which is related to the packing density of the vesicle. The steric
hindrance for the attack of the Si face of DMGBE
by benzyl bromide became larger because the packing density of DDAB
increased in the presence of cholesterol. This effect of cholesterol
leads to the enhanced enantioselectivity of the reaction. In general,
the properties of the self-assembling system can regulate the conversion
and enantioselectivity of interfacial alkylation reactions at the
surface of the assembly.

Conclusions
Enantioselective alkylation
was carried out by utilizing achiral
surfactant vesicles as a platform. The experiments suggested that
the essential factor for obtaining the enantioselectivity by the reaction
at the vesicle surface was not the chirality of the vesicles and vesicle
components but regulation of the reaction environment and interaction
between vesicle components and the reactants. The membrane properties
of the self-assembling system and, particularly, its polarity have
a strong regulatory influence on the interaction of the platform with
the reactants, which eventually influences the conversion and enantioselectivity.
A reaction mechanism is proposed by considering the plausible interactions
between the surfactant (or lipid) and reactants to explain the result
of different enantiomers obtained by using the DDAB vesicle and liposomes.
It is now expected that an interfacial enantioselective reaction could
be regulated by adjusting the membrane properties of vesicles and
the interactions, providing a new and clean process for asymmetric
synthesis.

Experimental Methods
Materials
DPPC and DOPC were purchased
from Avanti
Polar Lipid (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol was purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). CTAB, sodium hydroxide, and benzyl bromide
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). DDAB and DMGBE
were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). These
chemicals were used without further purification.

Preparation
of Vesicles
A chloroform solution containing
lipids was dried in a round-bottom flask by evaporation under vacuum.
The obtained lipid thin film was dissolved in chloroform again, and
the solvent was evaporated. The lipid thin film was kept under high
vacuum for at least 3 h and was then hydrated with distilled water
at room temperature. The liposome suspension was frozen at −80
°C and thawed at 50 °C to enhance the transformation of
small vesicles into larger multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). This freeze–thaw
cycle was performed five times. MLVs were used to prepare large unilamellar
vesicles by extruding the MLV suspension 11 times through 2 layers
of polycarbonate membranes, with different mean pore diameters (50,
100, and 200 nm), using an extruding device (Liposofast; Avestin Inc.,
Ottawa, Canada).

Evaluation of Membrane Polarities
Laurdan is sensitive
to the polarity around the molecule itself, and its fluorescence properties
enable the evaluation of the surface polarity of lipid membranes.
The Laurdan emission spectra exhibit a redshift caused by dielectric
relaxation. The emission spectra were measured with an excitation
wavelength of 340 nm, and the general polarization (GP340) or membrane polarity was calculated as follows  where I440 and I490 represent the fluorescence
intensity of
Laurdan at 440 and 490 nm, respectively. The total concentrations
of lipid (or surfactant) and Laurdan were 1 mM and 10 μM, respectively.
For the CTAB micelle, the concentration of CTAB and Laurdan were 10
mM and 100 μM due to the critical micelle concentration of CTAB
(∼1 mM).

The fluorescence spectrum of Laurdan was deconvoluted
into two spectra using Peakfit software (Systat Software Inc., CA):
one originated from the localization of Laurdan in an ordered membrane
(ordered phase) and the other originated from the localization of
Laurdan in a disordered membrane (disordered phase).

Alkylation
of DMGBE with Benzyl Bromide
DMGBE (0.3
mg (1.0 μmol)) was dissolved in pure water, and then, the aqueous
solution was mixed with the vesicle suspension and NaOH aqueous solution
(10%) to obtain 1 mL of reaction solution. Benzyl bromide (1.5 μL
(12 μmol)) was finally added to initiate the reaction (Scheme 1). The reaction solution
was stirred at 500 rpm at room temperature for 24 h. The total concentrations
were 1.0 mM DMGBE, 12 mM benzyl bromide, 10 mM lipid, and 0.3 M NaOH.
In the case of micelles, instead of liposomes, an aqueous solution
of CTAB was added. The total concentrations were fixed to the same
values as those for the reaction with liposomes.

HPLC Measurements
of the Reaction Solution
After the
reaction completed, the product (and reactant) was extracted to the
organic solvent using the Bligh–Dyer method. In brief, 1 mL
of the reaction solution was mixed with 2 mL of methanol and 1 mL
of chloroform, resulting in a homogeneous, colorless, and transparent
liquid. Then, 1 mL each of chloroform and pure water were added to
the solution to lead to a phase separation. Centrifugation was performed
(1400 rpm, 5 min) to complete the phase separation using a Tabletop
Centrifuge, KUBOTA 5200 (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan).

After the extraction,
the organic phase was moved into a round-bottom flask and chloroform
was removed by evaporation. Diethyl ether (1 mL) was added to the
flask, and 10 μL was taken and dissolved in 1 mL of the mobile
phase for HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was carried out using a Warers
1515 Isocratic HPLC Pump and Waters 2489 UV/Visible Detector (Waters,
MA). To evaluate the conversion of the reaction and enantiomeric excess,
a HPLC column Chiralpak IA (Daicel Corp., Osaka, Japan) was used.
The mobile phase was hexane/2-propanol = 99:1, flow rate = 0.5 mL/min.

Adsorption of Reactants onto Vesicle
The adsorption
amounts of the reactant (DMGBE) were evaluated by a UV spectrophotometer
(UV-1800; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The total concentration of the
reactant and vesicles were same as those in the alkylation method
(DMGBE = 1.0 mM, vesicle = 12 mM, NaOH = 0.3 M). The solution was
incubated for an hour at room temperature with 500 rpm stirring. The
adsorption percentages were calculated from the difference in UV absorbance
of the solutions without and with vesicles  where Ainitial and Afiltrated represent
the absorbance of the reactant in the NaOH aqueous solution and in
the vesicle suspension, respectively.
