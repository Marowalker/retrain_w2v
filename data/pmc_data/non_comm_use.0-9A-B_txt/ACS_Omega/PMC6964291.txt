Uniquely amphoteric soy protein (SP)-rich ultra-fine
fibers (231
nm average diameter) have been facilely electrospun from aq. colloids
and rendered water-insoluble by heating (150 °C, 12 h) to be
highly stable over 14 d (pH 7) as well as under extremely acidic to
basic (pH 0–10, 2 d) or at boil (2 h) conditions. The SP-rich
fibrous membranes are easily tuned to be charged either negatively
by deprotonation above or positively by protonation below the 4.5
PI of SPs. This pH-responsive amphoterism has been demonstrated for
rapid adsorption of either cationic or anionic dyes, selective adsorption
of either dye from their mixtures, and repetitive adsorption/desorption
to recover and reuse both dyes and membranes. Chemisorption and heterogeneous
adsorption of ionic dyes was confirmed by close fitting to the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model (R2 = 0.9977–0.9999)
and Freundlich adsorption isotherm (R2 = 0.9879). This is the first report of water-resilient and pH-robust
ultrafine fibrous membranes fabricated from aqueous colloids of neat
globular SPs, the major byproducts of under-utilized edible oil and
biodiesel. The natural polyampholyte origin, amphoterism, and green
processing make these fibrous materials unique and versatile for many
potential applications involving both anionic and cationic species.

Introduction
The increasing and cumulative presence
of dyes from industrial
effluents in our water ways has posed serious toxicity to aquatic
ecosystems and human health.1 To remove
dyes, activated carbon particulates1 and
biosorbents derived from agricultural byproducts2 are among the most widely studied, however, still produce
concentrated sludges as secondary pollutants that require safe disposal
and/or costly recycling. Polymeric adsorbents that are capable of
controlled separation and regeneration of valuable dyes are thus appealing.3,4 Either negatively or positively charged synthetic5−10 and natural11−13 polyelectrolytes have been processed into adsorbents
for selectively adsorbing either cationic5,9,11−13 or anionic6−8,10 dyes. Some pH-responsive adsorbents
have been derived but only from synthetic polyampholytes14 and mixtures with various chemical modification
and/or polymerization.15−19 None has been generated from natural polymers or polyampholytes,
that is, proteins, especially in the form of ultrafine fibers.

Soy proteins (SPs) are mixtures of large and complex globular proteins
with ca. 47 mol % amino acids containing strongly polar side groups,
that is, 20.5 mol % −COOH and 18.0 mol % −NH2,20 thus natural polyampholytes. Epichlorohydrin-crosslinked
SP hydrogels have shown to exhibit pH-responsive swelling behavior
at pH 2–12.21 SPs are also readily
available, being 44–48% of the vastly under-utilized soy meals,
that is, the main byproduct of the largest edible oil and biodiesel
production in the United States.22 Among
adsorbents, fibers are desirable for their high specific surface and
easy engineering into porous and continuous mass. Fiber spinning the
complex and large globular SPs is, however, challenging in comparison
to fibrous proteins, such as collagen23 and silk fibroin.24 To electrospin into
finer fibers for even a higher specific surface, SPs were denatured
and hydrolyzed by heat (40–90 °C, 40 min to 8 d)25−30 and/or alkali (pH 12)27,29,31 to be dispersed in organic25,26 or aqueous media27−31 first, then with added polymer carriers, such as polyethylene oxide
(400–900 kDa at 10 w/w %27,31 or 200 kDa at 33 w/w %25,26) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (7829 or
10028kDa at 50 w/w %),
and/or surfactants (i.e. 0.529 or 1%27 Triton X-100 and 17.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate30).

Previously, we have successfully dispersed
soy protein isolate
(SPI) homogeneously as aqueous (aq.) SP colloids (SPCs) at up to 9%
by high-speed blending (30k rpm, 15 min).32 These aq. SPCs have shown to be amphoteric, exhibiting ζ-potential
ranging from −39.4 to +32.4 mV and an isoelectric point (PI)
of 4.5. This study was, therefore, to develop a green and facile approach
to process these unmodified aq. SPCs into high specific surface fibrous
membranes. First, electrospinning of aq. SPCs was investigated by
hybridizing with fiber-forming PVA to avoid organic reactions or chemical
modification. The highly polar SP and PVA were then rendered less
water soluble by cross-linking via chemical reaction with naturally
occurring, biocompatible, and less harmful genipin, that is, 5000–10000
times less cytotoxic than glutaraldehyde33 and has shown to cross-link electrospun chitosan (21 °C, 1
d)34 and gelatin (21 °C, 7 d)35 fibers. In addition, heat-induced self-condensation
of amino acid side groups (105–180 °C, 24–120 h)36−38 that have demonstrated to render electrospun collagen36,37 and gelatin38 fibers water insoluble
was streamlined. The effects of genipin cross-linking and streamlined
heat treatment were systematically evaluated by aq. solubility and
resiliency as well as the secondary structure of SPs, crystalline
domains, chemical changes, and thermal behaviors. The pH-tunable amphoteric
characteristics of the optimally cross-linked membranes were elucidated
by their selective adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes as well
as the adsorption isotherm and kinetics, and cyclic adsorption/desorption
for dye recovery as well as fibrous membrane regeneration and reuse.

Results and Discussion
Electrospinnability of Alkaline- and Heat-Treated SPs and SPCs
Aqueous (aq.) 9% SP control suspension that was magnetically stirred
for 1 h phase separated in hours and could only be electrosprayed
into droplets. Adding equal mass of 9% PVA to the aq. SP control enabled
electrospinning only at a very low 0.01 mL/h rate and produced mostly
beads with very few fibers, while dripped continuously (Figure S1, Table S1). Heating (90 °C, 45 min) aq. SP control caused gelation that
was attributed to denaturation or the unfolding of globular structures
to reduce exposure of hydrophobic moieties to water. Following pH
adjustment to 12, the gel became miscible with equal mass of PVA but
still generated mostly beads stringing along thin fibers (Figure S1). Treating aq. SP control in the reverse
order, that is, adjusting pH to 12 then heating at 90 °C for
45 min, enabled continuous electrospinning of 1:1 SP/PVA mixture at
1.5 mL/h for at least 20 h without any dripping into a white membrane
composed of uniform, straight, and smooth fibers with the average
diameter of 267 nm (±65 nm, N = 100) (Figure S1). Heating the basic adjusted SP control
also enable electrospinning with less PVA, but 7:3 SP/PVA(9.75%) fibers
were irregular in widths and among lots of beads and splashes (Figure S1). This mixture also phase separated
in 7–8 h to prevent continuous electrospinning. Both the heterogenous
electrospun products and phase separation indicated the instability
of the mixture.

In contrast, aq. SPC, the supernatant from high
speed blending, mixed with PVA at 7:3 mass ratio could be facilely
electrospun at 1.5–2 mL/h feeding rate continuously for at
least 20 h. The fibrous membrane appeared white initially and then
became pale yellow when thickened. Fibers were uniform in 231 nm (±46
nm, N = 100) width with slightly angulated surfaces
(Figure 1a). Further
increasing SPC in the mixture to 90% could also be electrospun continuously,
but beads were observed regularly spaced along much thinner fibers
(Figure 1b). The significantly
improved electrospinnability of SPC mixtures is attributed to the
surface-active behavior of aq. SPCs that have shown to reduce the
surface tension of water to 41.2 mN/m at above 0.98%.32 The presence of residual salts from alkali extraction and
acid precipitation of SPI isolations may also increase the net charge
density to aid electrospinning. These most uniform 7:3 SPC/PVA hybrid
fibrous membranes were therefore selected for further studies and
denotes simply as fibrous membranes from here on.

shown as inset in each.

Genipin Reaction and Heat Treatment
The 7:3 SPC/PVA
fibrous membranes were chemically cross-linked with 11 mM genipin
in 1:1 v/v EtOH/water under two conditions or heat-treated (150 °C,
12 h). Complete submersion in genipin solutions at ambient temperature
turned the top of the membrane yellowish initially, then some pale
blue spots appeared after 5 h, and all dark blue after 24 h; while
the bottom remained pale blue (Figure S2), probably because of the lack of access to oxygen. The membrane
saturated with genipin solutions at 65 °C appeared bluish in
15 min, then dark blue on both sides in 30–60 min (Figure S2) and, upon lyophilization, became a
pale blue and fluffy mass of irregularly sized, deformed, and merged
fibers (Figure 1c).
The heat-treated membrane, on the other hand, retained the same fiber
sizes (227 ± 48 nm, N = 100) and morphology
but became slightly pale brown (Figure 1d). The brownish color may be attributed to the formation
of melanoidin pigments via Maillard reactions between amines of SPs
and carbonyl groups of reducing sugars, that is, glucose and lactose,
known to be present in SPI. Primary amines of SPs may either react
with the genipin ester group via SN2 nucleophilic substitution
to form secondary amides or attack the olefinic C-3 carbon of genipin
nucleophilically to open the dihydropyran ring to heterocyclic tertiary
amine intermediate 1, and then into intermediate 2 after removing
the C-10 hydroxyl (Figure S2). Aided by
oxygen radicals, these intermediates have shown to polymerize into
blue color products that are commonly recognized as indication of
successful genipin cross-linking of proteins.40 The significantly darker and uniformly blue fibrous membranes from
reaction with genipin at 65 °C for merely 1 h provided clear
evidence of cross-linking and were further studied.

None of
the bonds expected from genipin cross-linking reactions could be discerned
on the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)–attenuated total reflection
(ATR) spectra (Figure S2) because of their
overlapping with C–N and C–O stretch of SPs and PVA
at 1090 cm–1 and genipin characteristic peaks at
1443 and 1080 cm–1 (Figure 2a). Whereas the heat-treated membrane exhibited
a significantly reduced peak at 3362 cm–1 (N–H
and O–H stretchings, Figure 2a), consistent with the amidation and esterification
of the −NH2, −COOH, and −OH among
SPs and possibly esterification between SPs and PVA. Analyses of FTIR
amide I bonds in fibers electrospun from SPC as well as those reacted
with genipin or heat-treated all showed very high extents (86–89%)
of the ordered α-helix and β domains, 18–21% higher
than those electrospun from pH adjusted then heated SP suspensions
(not shown). X-ray diffraction diagrams also confirmed that all fibrous
membranes were similarly semicrystalline with the crystalline index
(CrI) of 60.8–66.8% (Figure S3, Table S2).

as-spun, genipin-cross-linked
(65 °C, 1 h), and heated (150 °C, 12 h) fibrous membranes:
(a) FTIR–ATR spectra; (b) DSC; (c) TGA.

A similar PVA melting endotherm (ca. 227 °C,
30–45
J/g) was observed in as-spun and genipin-reacted fibrous membranes
as in electrospun PVA (228 °C, 55 J/g), but with lowered endotherm
and broad exotherms above 210 °C (Figure 2b,c, Table S3).
The peak decomposition temperature in both genipin (298 °C)-
and heat (287 and 313 °C)-treated samples was distinctively higher
than that of as-spun membranes (284 °C), indicating the improved
thermal stability, although their weight losses at 400 °C were
similar (52–57%, Figures 2c and S3, Table S3). These data confirmed both genipin reaction (65
°C, 1 h) and heat treatments (150 °C, 12 h) improved thermal
stability of the hybrid membranes.

Stability in Water
The stability of these fibrous membranes
in water was observed by their mass and morphology (Figure 3). The as-spun fibrous membranes
lost substantial mass (36.9%) after 1 d and only 1.4% more after prolonged
14 d exposure (Figure 3a, Table S4). The water-immersed membrane
remained opaquely white after lyophilization, but fibers deformed
and merged (Figure 3a, Table S4). The genipin-reacted membrane
lost less mass (21.5% after 14 d) and more gradually, that is, 10.8%
after 1 d and another 10.7% after 14 d (Table S4), and appeared pale blue with merged fibers upon lyophilization,
evident of reactions between genipin and SP amines but some loss of
genipin (Figure 3b, Table S4). In contrast, the heat-treated membrane
only lost 5.4% weight after 14 d in water and retained the same fiber
morphology except for ca. 20% wider fibers (277 ± 36 nm, N = 100) (Figure 3c). Most impressively, the heat-treated fibers remained essentially
unchanged morphologically from extended 2 d immersions in strong acid
(1 M HCl, pH 0) or base (0.0001 M NaOH, pH 10) and only slightly deformed
from boiling for 2 h, all while losing 8.9–12.4% mass (Figure 3d–f). Such
water resiliency was further examined by shearing the heat-treated
membrane into single fibers by high-speed blending (30k rpm, 1 min)
and then air-dried (AD) to be imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
to show excellent shape retention from shear force. The average root-mean-square
roughness of 118 ± 24 nm (N = 5, Figure S4), corresponding to the aggregated SPs
and the desirable higher specific surface for sorption applications.
The excellent integrity of heated fibers following prolonged aq. immersions
under extreme pH and at boil or strong shear force confirms the effectiveness
of heat-induced condensation among SPs and between SPs and PVA. The
5.4–12.4% mass losses from the heat-treated were likely because
of the unbonded PVA. Clearly, the impressive aqueous stability and
resiliency of the heat-treated SP fibers are superior over all those
reported by others.26−32

heated (150 °C, 12 h). Mass loss values in % (N = 3) are denoted.

Color Change in Wet and Dry States
The as-spun fibrous
membranes appeared opaquely white, became translucent and gel-like
when wet by water, and then translucent pale yellow and film-like
when AD, losing most of fibrous features (Figure S5). Both genipin and heat-treated SPC/PVA fibrous membranes
showed remarkable changes in colors and color strength (CS) when saturated
with water (Figure 4a,b). The genipin-reacted membrane turned from pale blue (CS = 36)
into dark blue (CS = 394) once wet by water and remained dark blue
(CS = 330) when AD into a thin film (Figure 4a–c, Table S5). The heat-treated membranes were khaki (Ch = 9) in color and became
orange (CS = 98) when wet and then reversed back to similarly khaki
(CS = 15) when air dried (Figure 4a,b,d, Table S5). Therefore,
the color changes to the respective orange and dark blue colors of
both genipin and heat-treated membranes can signal the presence of
water, but only the heated membrane remained fibrous and could return
to the original color upon air-drying, reversible for a few times,
giving another clear evidence of sufficient cross-linking and water
stability of the heat-treated fibrous membranes.

Rapid and Selective Adsorption and Desorption of Ionic Dyes
The as-spun membranes were hydrophilic, having an average water
contact angle (CA) of 39.2° and absorbing 21.2 ± 0.7 mL/g
(N = 5) water, while even more readily wettable by
nonpolar toluene, hexadecane, and octane but absorbing much less (7.1–9.4
mL/g) of these low-surface tension liquids and lost almost no mass
(Table 1). The as-spun
membranes were clearly amphiphilic on their surfaces but more hydrophilic
in the bulk and in fact partially water soluble, losing over one-third
of mass and fibrous structures as observed earlier. The 12 h heat-treated
membrane surface became significantly hydrophobic with an average
water CA of 110.5° (Table 1), while the bulk of the membrane remained amphiphilic, absorbing
similar quantities of both water (20.5 mL/g) and nonpolar solvents
(15.5–23.4 mL/g) (Table 1). The heat-induced hydrophobicity is consistent with dehydration
reactions among polar −OH, −COOH, and −NH2 groups into less polar amide and nonpolar esters. Lengthening
the heat treatment to 48 h only slightly increased the water CA to
119.8 ± 1.8°, indicating slightly further condensations.

Wetting and adsorption of aq. cationic methylene blue
(MB) and
anionic CBY as well as lipophilic Sudan IV in hexadecane of the fibrous
membranes behaved differently under the neutral condition. Aq. MB
and CBY droplets (10 μL) wetted the as-spun membrane within
3–5 s and water in both dye solutions spread to wet larger
areas than the initial droplets. However, cationic MB only colored
the original footprint of the droplet whereas anionic CBY spreads
nearly to the edge of the wetted area (Figure 5a). This swift affinity of cationic MB over
the anionic CBY to the as-spun membrane indicates its more negatively
charged nature. The heat-treated membrane also showed similarly higher
affinity to cationic MB than anionic CBY (not shown) but took longer
to wet, that is, 10 s or a few minutes for that heated for 12 or 48
h, respectively, indicative of the increased hydrophobicity while
remaining more negatively charged. The one heated for 48 h even caused
the aq. CBY to bead up (Figure 5a, right) but insufficiently hydrophobic to adsorb lipophilic
Sudan IV in hexadecane.

(N = 5); adsorption of MB (blue) and CBY (orange)
at the 1 mg/mL membrane to solution ratio over time: (b) at pH 7 and
(c) at pH 2.

The pH-dependent amphoteric characteristics of
the heat-treated
fibrous membranes were further demonstrated by respective adsorption
of cationic MB and anionic CBY under neutral and acidic (pH 2) conditions.
At pH 7, above the 4.5 PI of SPs, the fibrous membrane was negatively
charged and adsorbed cationic MB rapidly to remove 94.3% from the
10 mg/L mixture in 10 s but adsorbed only 9.9% CBY (Figure 5b). At pH 2, 94.0% of anionic
CBY in the 10 mg/L mixture was adsorbed in 5 min while only 6.2% MB
was adsorbed (Figure 5c). The distinct pH-dependent and switchable electrostatic binding
preference toward ionic species of the heated membrane is attributed
to deprotonation of −COOH at neutral or protonation of −NH2 groups at pH 2, that is, above and below the PI. With increasing
initial MB concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 1000 mg/L, the MB absorbed
decreased, that is, 91.3, 81.4, 54.2, and 31.1%, respectively, and
leveled off after 15 min at lower 10–200 mg/L and 30 min at
higher 500–1000 mg/L concentrations (Figure 5b). Total MB adsorbed increased with initial
10–1000 mg/L concentrations, that is, from 10.5 to 311.3 mg
per g of fibrous membrane (Figure S6).
In the case of anionic CBY (200 mg/L), the total removal (54.0%) at
pH 2 was similar to that of cationic MB (54.2%) at pH 7 but reaching
equilibrium over much longer time of 60 min (Figure 5c). While the maximum adsorption capability
(312.5 mg/g, pH 7) of heat-treated (12 h) fibrous membranes (Figure S6) is similar to values reported on some
activated carbons (9.8–980 mg/g, 0.1–1 h), the most
significant distinction is in its short 0.5 h time to reach equilibrium,
far shorter than fibers electrospun from other proteins and/or synthetic
polymers,11−13 that is, 6 h by keratin (170 mg/g, pH 6),11 2 h by sericin/β-cyclodextrin/PVA (2:1:7,
187 mg/g, pH 8),12 and 6 h by β-cyclodextrin/poly(acrylic
acid) (5:1, 826 mg/g, pH 9)13 and most
agricultural and industrial wastes (0.84–472.1 mg/g, ca. 0.5–24
h).45

The MB adsorption data on heat-treated
membranes showed a significantly
higher correlation coefficient R2 values
of >0.99 in Ho’s pseudo-second-order model (Figure S7) than the merely 0.47–0.70 in
Lagergren’s
pseudo-first-order model (not shown). Therefore, the overall MB adsorption
is confirmed to be by chemisorption instead of physisorption. The
adsorbed MB quantities also showed a better fit of Freundlich isotherm
with the R2 of 0.9879 (Figure S7) over the Langmuir isotherm (R2 = 0.9269) to support more heterogeneous adsorption of MB
onto the fiber surfaces where −COOH and −NH2 groups are randomly distributed.

The five cyclic MB desorption–desorption
of heat-treated
membranes showed that 93–97% was adsorbed in 5 min and 91–94%
of MB desorbed within 1 min, turning the dark blue membrane into the
original dark yellow color (Figure 6a,b). MB adsorption and desorption were over 90% in
all 5 cycles while the membranes retained their fibrous morphologies
(Figure 6a,b), validating
the feasibility of recovering MB and regenerating membranes for practical
repetitive adsorption/desorption applications.

(1:1, 20 mg/L) before and after selective adsorption of MB at pH 7;

Under neutral condition, it took only 10 s for
the anionically
charged membrane to remove 99.7% of the cationic MB from the 1:1 MB/methyl
orange (MO) mixtures, turning the clover green mixture into lemon
yellow and leaving 89.9% anionic MO (Figure 6c). At pH 2, the positively charged fibrous
membranes selectively adsorbed 77.9% anionic MO within 10 s, leaving
a blue solution containing 79.7% MB (Figure 6d). While selective adsorption took only
seconds in both cases, low extents of the oppositely charged dyes,
that is, ca. 10% MO and 20% MB, were also adsorbed in the due process,
indicating very high but not absolute selectivity. Nevertheless, the
unique pH-dependent amphoteric characteristics as demonstrated by
selective binding of cationic and anionic dyes demonstrate the potential
of these SP fibrous membranes for applications in separation and recovery
of oppositely charged ionic species.

Conclusions
Homogeneous and stable aq. SPCs have been
facilely produced by
high-speed blending (30k rpm, 15 min) and robustly electrospun into
SP-rich fibrous membranes of uniform ultra-fine fibers in 231 nm average.
These SP-rich fibrous membranes can be rendered water-insoluble with
either genipin reaction or heat treatment. The heat-treated membranes,
in particular, exhibit excellent wet resiliency under prolonged exposure
(pH 7, 14 d), extremely acidic (pH 0, 2 d) and basic (pH 10, 2 d)
conditions, and at boil (2 h) and from high shear force (30k rpm,
1 min). This successful shear force process to generate aq. SPCs for
electrospinning and heat condensation to fabricate wet-resilient fibrous
membranes represents the first green approach for globular proteins
without chemicals such as alkali, urea, or surfactants as reported
by others. Furthermore, these amphoteric SP-rich fibrous membranes
can be simply deprotonated to carry negative charges under neutral
or protonated to be positively charged under acidic (pH 2) conditions
to selectively adsorb respective cationic MB or anionic CBY and MO
dyes via electrostatic interactions. The rapid MB adsorption fits
the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Freundlich adsorption isotherm
to affirm chemisorption mechanism and the chemically heterogeneous
nature of the fiber surfaces. The absorbed dyes can be effectively
desorbed to regenerate the wet-resilient fibrous membranes in five
adsorption/desorption cycles. This demonstrated ability to selectively
separate and recover cationic and anionic dyes that can be expanded
in the separation and recovery of other cationic and/or anionic compounds
relevant to many potential environmental, biological, and industrial
applications.

at 95 °C for 6 h under constant stirring and then cooled to ambient
temperature. All concentrations were in wt % and expressed as % throughout.

Electrospinning was performed using mixtures of either magnetically
stirred (ca. 2k rpm, 1 h) 9% SP suspension or SPC with 9% PVA at 1:1,
7:3, and 9:1 w/w ratios. Each mixture was loaded into a 30 mL horizontally
placed syringe (Popper & Sons, Inc.), fed at 0.01–2 mL/h
using a syringe pump (KDS 200, KD Scientific, USA) through a flat-end
metal needle (21 gauge), and electrospun at 15 kV operated with a
dc power supply (ES 30-0.1 P, Gamma High Supply, USA). The fine fibrous
membranes were collected on a vertically placed aluminium foil (30
cm × 30 cm) at 25 cm from the needle tip to reach a typical thickness
of 150–200 μm.

Genipin Cross-linking and Heat Treatment
Electrospun
SPC/PVA (7:3, 9%) fibrous membranes (ca. 100 mg) were chemically reacted
with genipin or heat-treated to improve aq. stability. Chemical cross-linking
with 11 mM genipin in 1:1 v/v EtOH/water was performed by either complete
submersion in genipin in an open Petri dish to expose to ambient oxygen
for 24 h or saturation with ca. 600 mg genipin solutions in a sealed
centrifuge tube at 65 °C for 1 h. Following each process, the
membrane was thoroughly washed with EtOH and water in sequence, frozen
at −20 °C for 1 h, and then lyophilized at −50
°C for 24 h in a freeze-drier (free zone 1.0 L Benchtop Freeze
Dry System, Labconco, Kansas City, MO). Electrospun SPC/PVA (7:3,
9%) fibrous membranes were heated at 150 °C under vacuum (ca.
20 Hg) for 12 or 48 h and cooled to ambient temperature.

Characterizations
The morphologies of as-spun and cross-linked
electrospun SPC/PVA (7:3, 9%) fibrous membranes were observed using
a field-emission SEM (XL 30-SFEG, FEI/Philips, USA; Quattro, Thermo
Scientific, USA) at a working distance of ca. 5 mm and an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV. Each sample was mounted with conductive carbon tapes
and sputter-coated with gold/palladium before imaging. Widths of fibers
were measured from 100 individual fibers, and the mean and standard
deviation were reported. Heated (12 h) membranes were blended (30k
rpm, 1 min) in water at 0.1% and AD on the freshly peeled mica (highest
grade V1 mica discs, 15 mm, Ted Pella, Inc.). Then, both Leica DM2500
optical microscope equipped with the cross-polarizing filter and AFM
(MFP-3D, Oxford Instruments Asylum Research, Inc., Santa Barbara,
CA) were applied for the imaging. AFM scanned in the tapping mode
with OMCL-AC160TS standard silicon probes (tip radius < 10 nm,
spring constant = 28.98 N/m, resonant frequency of ca. 310 kHz, Olympus
Corp.) at 1 Hz scan rate under the ambient condition.

The chemical
composition and secondary structures of SPs in fibrous membranes were
studied by FTIR–ATR spectra collected from 3500 to 1000 cm–1 at a resolution of 2 cm–1 using
a Nicolet iN10 microscope spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled detector. The secondary
structure composition, including α-helix (1645–1662 cm–1), β-sheet (1613–1637, 1682–1689
cm–1), β-turn (1662–1682 cm–1), and random coil (1637–1645 cm–1),39 was analyzed in the range of 1600–1700
cm–1 as reported in our prior work.32 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected to study
the crystalline structures of SPC cast film and electrospun PVA and
hybrid fibers on a Scintag XDS 2000 powder diffractometer using a
Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (=1.5406 Å) at an anode voltage
of 45 kV and a current of 40 mA. Samples were compressed into 1 mm
thick flat sheets between two glass slides, and diffractograms were
recorded from 5 to 40° at a scan rate of 2°/min. Peak deconvolution
analysis was conducted using Peak Fit (Systat Software), and individual
peaks were fitted by Gaussian functions with R2 > 0.99 for all deconvolutions. The ratio of the total
crystalline
peak area and the sum of both crystalline and amorphous area was taken
as the crystallinity index (CrI).

Thermal behavior of SPC cast
film and electrospun membranes was
measured using a Shimadzu thermal analysis system (TA-SOWSI), including
a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-60) and a thermogravimetric
analyzer (TGA-50). Both DSC and TGA were performed by heating at 10
°C/min under flowing N2 at a 50 mL/min rate to 400
°C. The first derivative was derived from the TGA data and plotted
as the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve. The L* (lightness),
a* (red to green) and b* (yellow to blue) color coordinates and K/S (absorption/scattering) values of as-spun
and crosslinked hybrid fibrous membranes were measured using a Gretag
Macbeth Color-Eye 7000A tester (Akron, Ohio, United States). All samples
were sandwiched between two glass slides, measured at four different
locations, and the average is reported. K/S values were calculated by the Kubelka–Munk equation
based on the spectral reflectance (R in %) of the
samples as  

The CS was calculated by using the
as-spun hybrid membrane as the
standard  

The dry mass of each membrane before
and after immersion in aq.
media with pH of 0–10 for 1–14 d and air-drying at 65
°C was measured to 0.01 mg using an analytical balance (Shimadzu,
AUW220D). Water CA (10 μL) on the surface of fibrous membranes
was measured by the drop shape analysis method before the spreading
of water droplets. Each membrane was measured five times in different
locations to derive the average and standard deviation. The liquid
(water, toluene, hexadecane, and octane, N = 5) uptake
of the as-spun and heat-treated (12 h) membrane was also weighed to
report the average and standard deviation. The length, width, and
thickness swelling of the heat-treated membrane immersed in water
for up to 2 h were determined by measuring with a vernier scale to
the nearest 0.01 mm.

Adsorption and Desorption
The adsorption of cationic
MB or anionic CBY on heat-treated (12 h) 7:3 SPC/PVA fibrous membrane
was carried out by immersing ca. 100 mg adsorbent in 100 mL aq. MB
(10–1000 mg/L) at pH 7 or CBY (10–200 mg/L) at pH 2
at ambient temperature, handshaking for 10 s then in a shaker (100–150
rpm) for up to 2 h. At predetermined time intervals, 0.5 mL solution
was taken to quantify the amount of MB or CBY using an Evolution 600
UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) based on the calibration
curve determined in the same aq. media. The percentage of MB or CBY
removal was calculated as  where C0 and C is the initial and current dye concentration, respectively.
The amount of MB or CBY adsorbed at each time interval on the membrane, q (in mg/g), was calculated as  where V is the solution volume,
and m is the mass of the membranes. The adsorption kinetics of MB
on heat-treated membranes, that is, t/qt (qt, quantity adsorbed at time t) versus t plot, was fitted with both Lagergren’s pseudo-first-order41 and Ho’s pseudo-second-order42 models for physisorption and chemisorption,
respectively, as well as Freundlich43 and
Langmuir44 isotherms, typical of adsorption
to heterogeneous and homogeneous surfaces, respectively. The recovery
of MB and regeneration of the fibrous membrane (ca. 100 mg) was conducted
in five repetitive adsorption/desorption cycles of 5 min adsorption
of MB (20 mg/L, 100 mL) at pH 7 and 1 min desorption of MB at pH 2.
Following each adsorption/desorption cycle, the membrane was thoroughly
washed by acid (pH 2) and then neutralized for the next cycle. The
adsorption efficiency was evaluated based on dyes left in the solution,
and the desorption efficiency was derived from the dyes recovered.
Selective absorption of either cationic MB or anionic MO dye from
100 mL 1:1 w/w MB/MO mixture (20 mg/L) was studied at pH 7 and 2.
Anionic MO was used in place of anionic CBY as CBY precipitated when
mixed with MB.
