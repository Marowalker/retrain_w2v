The
growing production of biodiesel as a promising alternative
and renewable fuel led as the main problem the dramatic increase of
its by-product: glycerol. Different strategies for glycerol derivatization
have been reported so far, some more efficient or sustainable than
others. Herein, we report a very promising and eco-friendly transformation
of glycerol in nontoxic solvents and chemicals (i.e., solketal, ketals),
proposing three new families of Fe(III) compounds capable of catalysing
glycerol acetalization with unpublished turn over frequencies (TOFs),
and adhering most of the principles of green chemistry. The comparison
between the activity of complexes of formula [FeCl3(1-R)] (1-R = substituted pyridinimine), [FeCl(2-R,R′)] (2-R,R′ = substituted O,O′-deprotonated
salens) and their corresponding simple salts reveals that the former
are extremely convenient because they are able to promote solketal
formation with excellent TOFs, up to 105 h–1. Satisfactory performances were shown with respect to the entire
range of substrates, with results being competitive to those reported
in the literature so far. Moreover, the experimental activity was
supported by an accurate and complete ab initio study, which disclosed
the fundamental role of iron(III) as Lewis acid in promoting the catalytic
activity. The unprecedented high activity and the low loading of the
catalyst, combined with the great availability and the good eco-toxicological
profile of iron, foster future applications of this catalytic process
for the sustainable transformation of an abundant by-product in a
variety of chemicals.

Introduction
Biodiesel is a mixture
of alkyl esters of fatty acids obtained
by transesterification/esterification of vegetable oils or fats with
light alcohols (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Manufacture of Biodiesel (CxHy = Fatty Acid Chain)
The growing interest in renewable resources increases
biodiesel
production year by year. As a consequence, its by-product glycerol
is dramatically invading the market: it is estimated that 41.9 billion
liters will be produced in 2020.1,2 Transforming this by-product
into a renewable bio-based raw material is, therefore, a priority.
Not surprisingly, many new processes have been proposed that use glycerol
as a starting material for a wide range of solvents, chemicals, and
intermediates.3−7 Due to its unique structure, glycerol is a promising intermediate
for the synthesis of acrolein, glycolic acid, ethylene glycol, oxalic
acid, syngas, 1,2-propanediol, mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides, epichlorohydrin,
polyglycerols, acetals, ketals, and many others (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Examples of Glycerol
Conversion into High Added Value Chemicals
Among these compounds, acetals and ketals are an emerging
class
of products that can be used as nontoxic solvents,5 fuel additives,8−10 and building blocks as glycerol-protected
intermediates.11

The formation of
glycerol-based acetals/ketals is an equilibrium
reaction and is typically acid-catalyzed, following the general Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Ketals/Acetals Prepared
from Ketones/Aldehydes and Glycerol
The reaction appeal is evidenced by the intense search
for effective
catalytic systems adhering to the conditions prescribed by the principles
of green chemistry,12 such as atom economy,
absence of auxiliaries, and ease of recovery of the catalyst. Most
of the known catalysts are heterogeneous,13−35 and only a few examples refer to homogeneous systems.36−40 Furthermore, although some mechanistic hypothesis have been proposed,26,41 theoretical in-depth studies are very rare.42

Some of us have long been involved in the development of Lewis
acid catalysts for the sustainable transformation of vegetable oils
and derivatives.43−47 Within this field we recently communicated47 preliminary results about a set of homogenous catalysts based on
iron(III), capable of promoting the synthesis of solketal (five-member
ketal in Scheme 2,
where R1 = R2 = Me). Importantly, the results
suggested a high capacity of iron(III) complexes in promoting the
functionalization of glycerol.

In this work, we report the synthesis
of a broad scope of ketal-based
chemicals through several iron(III) catalysts. Satisfactory performances
were shown with respect to the entire range of substrates with results
competitive to those reported in the literature. The best catalyst
showed a turn over frequency (TOF) of 105 h–1, which is 3 orders of magnitude greater than those reported in the
literature so far for the best homogeneous catalysts.36−40 The experimental study has been accompanied for the first time by
a detailed investigation of the general mechanism through a sophisticated
ab initio calculation, which highlighted the significant role of iron(III)
as Lewis acid. The calculated thermodynamic and kinetic parameters
are in full agreement with previously presented experimental values.22,48,49

Overall, the unprecedented
high activity of the catalysts, the
low loading (up to 10 ppm), the good eco-toxicological profile, along
with their generous availability promise to be convincing features
for the sustainable transformation of a renewable by-product in a
nontoxic solvent.50−53

Results and Discussion
Catalytic Synthesis of Solketal
The synthesis of solketal
(P1) is reported in Scheme 4. A review of the literature (Table 1) discloses flourishing articles,
which propose new catalytic systems for the promotion of the reaction,
and that most of them are heterogeneous (in italic in Table 1).

Substantial amounts of catalyst (≥3–5%)
are necessary
to achieve conversions higher than 95% (entries 4, 6, 7, and 13),
and more often the conversion is incomplete with heterogeneous catalysts,
probably due to the establishment of equilibria inside the pores of
the solids. In view of these disadvantages, the possibility of recycling
the catalyst must be mentioned, which in some cases has been claimed.15,25,26,40 Homogeneous catalysts are much less represented (entries 16–20)
and, as expected, are used in lower concentrations, although never
negligible.

The first target of our work was the choice of a
convenient set
of modular iron(III) catalysts for the synthesis of solketal. Three
families were chosen: complexes of formula [FeCl3(1-R)] containing N,N′-pyridinimine
ligands 1-R, complexes of formula [FeCl(2-R,R′)], containing N,N′,O′,O ligands derived from the deprotonation
of salen 2-R,R′-H2, and simple Fe(III) salts. The choice was to reveal the effects
of (i) the presence of a ligand, (ii) the different geometry of the
complexes, and (iii) the stereoelectronic nature of the substituents
within the same class (Figure 1).

Figure 1 [FeCl3(1-R)] and [FeCl(2-R,R′)] catalyst families.

Initially, the complete set of complexes was screened. All
of the
runs were performed under reflux with an acetone/glycerol ratio of
4:1 for 1.5 h. The catalyst loading was kept at 0.050% mol/mol with
respect to glycerol, such that all of the complexes resulted soluble
in the reaction mixture. To efficiently eliminate water and shift
the equilibrium towards the product, a dedicated experimental apparatus
was set up (Figure 2), in which a small column of 3 Å molecular sieves was introduced
on top of the condenser, able to trap the water both in gaseous and
condensed liquid phases. It should be noted that a complete conversion
using FeCl3 has been recently reported under conditions
that do not require the use of a water trap (entry 19 of Table 1). This claim is,
however, contradicted by the observations of the authors themselves,
who report that the system remains biphasic even at the end of the
reaction. In our opinion, this instead reflects a limited conversion,
overestimated due to a nonappropriate analysis of the reaction mixture.

Figure 2 Apparatus
for the synthesis of solketal: a water trap contained
in a small column of 3 Å molecular sieves introduced upstream
of the condenser.

The initial biphasic
reaction mixture gradually became homogeneous
because solketal improves the mutual miscibility of the components.

The progress of the reaction was monitored by recording the 1H NMR spectrum of a small aliquot of the reaction mixture
diluted in 0.6 mL of D2O. Conversion and selectivity could
be assessed by proper integration of selected regions.

This
first set of experiments disclosed that complexes of type
1 are more active than type 2 (Table 2). In fact, the former ones could quantitatively transform
glycerol over the course of 1.5 h, whereas the conversion was only
partial with the salens species, a sign that substitution of chloride
ligands for the more basic alkoxide donor atoms depresses the Lewis
acidity of the metal center.

b 0.0050 mmol.

c Selectivity ≥ 98%.

Within this class (entries
9–15), the variation of substituents
determined significant effects on the activity: the presence of electron-withdrawing
groups enhanced the conversion up to 65% (entries 14 and 15).

Also, the simple salts could effectively promote the reaction (entries
2–4), and, therefore, further refinements were carried out
by comparing type [FeCl3(1-R)] complexes and
simple salts. Only at 0.00050% mol/mol (that is ca. 3 ppm of iron
versus glycerol), FeCl3 and the nitro derivative [FeCl3(1-NO2)] proved to be
the best catalysts, with TOF values of 105 h–1, that is few orders of magnitude greater than those reported in
the literature so far for the best homogeneous catalysts.36−40 Although iron(III) chloride was slightly more active, [FeCl3(1-NO2)] was considered
the best candidate for subsequent tests, as it is stable to air, easy
to handle, and with excellent solubility. These qualities are particularly
appreciated because they enhance the versatility of the catalyst and
allow its use in convenient conditions. As a proof, a run was performed
for isolating solketal.47 The catalyst
loading was kept at 0.00020%, and the product was easily obtained
by flash distillation of the excess of acetone with an iron content
of less than 10 ppm, and therefore already useful for numerous applications.

A conversion vs time plot was also obtained that showed the reaction
profile and the high initial TOF. The data was collected monitoring
the progress of the reaction both by NMR spectroscopy and by detecting
the trend of the boiling point of the mixture with a thermocouple
immersed in the reaction media (Figure 3). In fact, the progressive formation of solketal gradually
increases the boiling point of the mixture.

and temperature (red line) as a function
of time.

Other Substrates
The iron-catalyzed ketalization of
glycerol was extended to other carbonyl substrates, by using catalyst
[FeCl3(1-NO2)]. Benzaldehyde
or ketones (aliphatic: butanone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone; aromatic:
acetophenone; and functionalized: methyl levulinate) were selected
as substrates. Also, in these cases, previous literature mainly refers
to heterogeneous catalysts (in italic in Table 3), both inorganic and organic in nature.54−72 A first general observation is again that satisfactory conversions
are obtained using high catalyst amounts or more sophisticated reaction
conditions, such as inert atmosphere or ultrasounds. Less represented
are experiments with homogeneous catalysts, of greater interest in
this context. Conversion of benzaldehyde, butanone, acetophenone,
and cyclohexanone with the ionic liquid [MeSO3bmim]MeSO4 did not exceed 87%, a result partially weakened by the high
cost of the catalyst and the need to use toluene as co-solvent (entries
10, 19, 22, and 34). Better results were achieved with phosphomolybdic
acid, used in percentages of 0.5% mol/mol (entries 14, 20, and 23).
The catalyst was reused, although considerable quantities of toluene
were necessary to extract the product.

Within
this frame, we carried out the experiments using [FeCl3(1-NO2)] (Table 4). Two concentrations were chosen:
0.5% mol/mol, the most convenient for comparisons with similar homogeneous
systems, and 0.01%, to verify the permanence of activity even in the
case of more challenging substrates. The reactions were conducted
at a temperature so as to
favor the kinetics without compromising the stability of the catalyst.
In the case of high boiling substrates, removal of water was favored
by working at low pressure to allow its entrapment in the molecular
sieves (Figure 2),
as detailed in the table.

c Reaction time = 4 h.

Benzaldehyde, butanone, cyclohexanone, acetophenone,
and methyl
levulinate (entries 1–3 and 5–6) were quantitatively
converted at a loading of 0.5% mol/mol, and even at this lower value,
this simple catalyst demonstrated its excellent performance (87 and
82%, respectively, with benzaldehyde and butanone). These results
are extremely competitive with the previously discussed literature
reports. According to literature data, the benzaldehyde ketal consisted
of a mixture of the five- and six-membered products,39 as revealed by the NMR spectrum in deuterated methanol.
As expected,69 less satisfying were the
outcomes of the catalysis with cyclopentanone (entry 4).

Mechanistic
Study
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were performed to gain insights into the mechanism of the Fe-catalyzed
glycerol ketalization with acetone. [Fe(H2O)6]3+ was chosen as model active species because it demonstrated
to be active (entry 3, Table 2) and its simple structure avoids complication due to geometrical
isomerism.

The proposed catalytic cycle is resumed in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism
for Fe-Catalyzed Glycerol Ketalization with Acetone
First, acetone binding to the Lewis acid activates
the ketone for
the glycerol nucleophilic attack (I → II). Then, proton transfer between glycerol hydroxylic groups occurs
to yield an acyclic ketal (II → III). The loss of a water molecule from intermediate III is concerted with the intramolecular cyclization to yield the cyclic
ketal IV. Finally, displacement of the newly formed solketal
with a water molecule completes the catalytic cycle.

The computed
mechanism for the glycerol acetalization is reported
in Figure 4, whereas
the selected geometric parameters for reaction intermediates are shown
in Figure 5.

at the M06/LanL2DZ/6-31+G(d,p)/C-PCM (ε = 20.49) level of theory.
Free energies are reported in kcal/mol at 298 K.

Figure 5 Structures of I–IV intermediates
for Fe-catalyzed glycerol acetalization computed at the M06/LanL2DZ/6-31+G(d,p)/C-PCM
(ε = 20.49) level of theory.

Coordination of acetone to [Fe(H2O)6]3+ is the first step of the catalytic cycle. The exchange
of
one water molecule with acetone to give [Fe(H2O)5(acetone)]3+ is exergonic (ΔG =
−4.39 kcal/mol). The acetone oxygen (Oa in Figure 5) strongly interacts
with the iron ion, indeed the Oa–Fe distance is
1.89 Å and the Fe–Oa–Ca angle
is 180° (see intermediate I in Figure 5).

Fe–acetone
binding polarizes the C=O bond, increasing
the electrophilic character of the Ca atom and activating
the carbonyl group for the nucleophilic attack by glycerol.

Indeed, the acetone–glycerol adduct dissociates without
the binding of acetone with the Fe(III) Lewis acid, and a stable product
of the acetone–glycerol nucleophilic addiction cannot be optimized.

A barrier of 13.57 kcal/mol is computed for the nucleophilic addition
of glycerol on [Fe(H2O)5(acetone)]3+.

Moreover, the glycerol binding to acetone modifies the acetone
coordination to the iron center. Intermediate II is characterized
by a Fe–Oa–Ca angle of 144°,
whereas the Fe–Oa and Oa–Ca distances are 1.81 and 1.36 Å, respectively (see Figure 5). The observed structural
rearrangement results from the change in the hybridization state of
the Ca atom. The trigonal, planar sp2 hybridized
Ca of intermediate I changes to a tetrahedral,
sp3 hybridized state in intermediate II, leading
to an increase of the Ca–Oa distance
of about 0.11 Å when going from I to II. The interaction between Oa and the iron also increases
resulting in a decrease of the Fe–Oa distance of
about 0.08 Å when going from intermediate I to II. Another conformation for intermediate II (IIb, see Supporting Information), which can lead to the proton transfer from the glycerol to the
acetone oxygen was also examined at the same level of theory. This
other conformation resulted to be 6.52 kcal/mol less stable with respect
to II (see Supporting Information).

The Ob–Hb hydroxyl group in II is strongly hydrogen bonded to Oc (the Oc–Hb distance is 1.74 Å). The proton
transfer between Ob and Oc is slightly exergonic
(ΔG = −1.30 kcal/mol) with a very low
activation barrier (ΔG‡ =
0.81 kcal/mol).

Once intermediate III is formed,
a concerted nucleophilic
attack and loss of a water molecule bring the formation of the cyclic
ketal coordinated to the iron complex. A barrier of 24.65 kcal/mol
is computed for the concerted intramolecular cyclization.

Moreover,
the solketal product is weakly bound to the iron complex
(Fe–Oa distance is 1.96 Å in IV). The displacement of the cyclic ketal with a water molecule is
exergonic (ΔG = −7.96 kcal/mol), and
it completes the cycle allowing the catalyst regeneration.

A
ΔG of 0.04 kcal/mol is computed for the
complete reaction of Scheme 5, in perfect agreement with the experimental equilibrium constant
of about 1.49

Conclusions
This
paper reports a combined experimental and theoretical study
on the synthesis of glycerol-based ketals promoted by iron(III) complexes.
The screening of catalysts has shown that the presence of chloride
ions enhances the performance of the catalysts compared to those containing
alkoxide donors. Very gratifying results were obtained with low catalyst
loading, in some cases leading to nearly quantitative conversions
with an iron content below 10 ppm. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated
the key role played by iron(III) as Lewis acid. Overall, the ensemble
of results returns a clear picture of the “green” features
of the process, of actual relevance because a renewable by-product
is converted into useful chemicals, and confirms the prominent role
played by iron in relevant synthetic processes.47,73−76

Experimental Section
General
The known products were
characterized by comparing
their NMR spectra with those reported in the literature,40,68 by using a Bruker Avance Ultrashield 400 operating at a proton frequency
of 400 MHz. The following abbreviations were used for describing NMR
multiciplities: s, singlet; t, triplet; q, quartet; and m, multiplet.
Benzaldehyde and the other ketones were commercially available (Sigma-Aldrich)
and were used as received. The iron complexes were prepared according
to literature methods (see Figure 1).

Catalytic Runs
A mixture of glycerol
(0.92 g, 10 mmol),
the appropriate carbonyl compound (40 mmol), and the iron catalyst
was stirred according to the conditions described in Tables 2–4. When appropriate, depressure was applied to the reaction system
of Figure 1, and the
internal pressure was monitored by connection to a mercury column.
The product composition was analyzed through NMR spectroscopy by adding
a small aliquot of the homogeneous reaction mixture to 0.6 mL of the
appropriate deuterated solvent.

Computational
Details
All DFT calculations were performed
using the Gaussian 16 suite of programs.77

The structures of all intermediates were optimized using the
M06 density functional.78

The 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set was adopted for C, H, and O, whereas
the Fe atom was described by the LANL2DZ basis set and the associate
effective core potential,79 which was demonstrated
to be a suitable choice to describe the reactivity of metal centers.80−82

Frequency calculations were performed to assess the nature
of each
stationary point (minimum or transition state).

Bulk solvent
effects (acetone) were accounted for by using the
polarizable continuum model in its conductor-like version (C-PCM).83−85 Dispersion, repulsion, and cavitation terms were also considered.

The computation of harmonic frequencies was also performed to calculate
the free energy of all molecules at T = 298 K and P = 1 atm, assuming an ideal gas behavior.
