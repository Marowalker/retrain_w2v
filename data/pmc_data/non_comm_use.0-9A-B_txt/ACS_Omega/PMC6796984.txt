Based on the hollow
fiber protected molecularly imprinted polymer,
a micro-solid-phase extraction (μ-SPE) method was developed
and applied for the analysis of indole-3-butyric acid in mung bean
sprouts by high-performance liquid chromatography. The extraction
conditions of the μ-SPE method were optimized using L9(34) orthogonal, and optimum conditions were found as
follows: pH of sample solution was 2.0, chloroform was the organic
solvent for embedding the μ-SPE bars, and acetonitrile was the
desorption solvent. In addition, the extraction time was 80 min, desorption
time was 5 min, stirring speed was 800 rpm, and concentration of NaCl
was 10%. Under the optimum conditions, a standard curve was established
for IBA, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999. After extraction
with phosphate buffer solution (pH = 9.0), successful pretreatment
of mung bean sprouts was achieved by the μ-SPE method. The limit
of detection was 0.075 mg/kg, and the recoveries were found to be
in the range of 88.9–106.4%. This method is simple, environmentally
friendly, and can be used for the determination of indole auxin contents
in green bean sprouts quickly and accurately.

1 Introduction
Plant
hormones are present at low concentrations in plant tissues
but play an important role in regulating many aspects of plant growth.1 Auxins are the first of the major plant hormones
to have been discovered. The auxins including indole-3-acetic acid
(IAA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)
are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development.2 IBA promotes rooting and is found to be highly
effective compared to other auxins. Its concentration level exquisitely
controls growing processes of plants. The auxin level has a great
value for the study of biological process in plants. The auxins were
also applied to vegetables, and high-level residues may cause harm.
So, the quantitative determination of the auxin is often very important
in modern agriculture.3,4 Various techniques have been used
for the analysis of auxins; among them, liquid chromatography is the
most commonly used one.5 The quantitative
determination of auxins is still a challenging issue6,7 due to their low concentration and complex sample matrix. At this
point, sample pretreatment is considered to have vital importance
in the whole analytical process.8,9

Although solid-phase
extraction (SPE) has been widely applied for
the analysis, it consumes a considerable amount of organic solvent
as well as more time and causes a blockage of the column bed during
the extraction process.10 As an alternative
to traditional SPE, membrane-protected micro-solid phase extraction
(μ-SPE) was introduced by Lee’s group.11−13 Using μ-SPE,
the amounts of sorbent, desorption solvent, and sample volume decreased,
resulting in lower cost of the procedure.14−16 Since the solid
sorbent is packed inside a membrane, which is often hydrophobic such
as polypropylene hollow fibers,17−19 the direct contact of the sorbent
and sample matrix is avoided. Hollow fibers are widely used in liquid-phase
microextraction (LPME). Its small volume (dozens of microliters) enables
concentration of the target analytes. In addition, sample extraction
and filtration are achieved simultaneously in a single step owing
to the micropores (0.2 μm) on the fiber wall.20,21 Hence, complex samples can be easily treated without filtration.22 Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthetic
materials obtained by copolymerization of functional and cross-linking
monomers in the presence of a template molecule.23,24 MIPs can selectively adsorb a target molecule in preference to other
closely related compounds.25,26 MIPs have superior
specific recognition to other sorbents used in SPE. The most advanced
application of MIPs was believed to be in SPE.27

In this study, polypropylene hollow fibers were packed
with MIP
particles and formed microextraction bars. Tubular hollow fibers were
used to protect the MIP rather than a bag made of polymeric membranes.
The main purpose is to minimize the volume. A molecular imprinting
μ-SPE (MI-μ-SPE) method based on the microextraction bars
was proposed. This method takes advantages of both SPE and LPME, as
shown in Figure 1.
More importantly, it can overcome the poor recognition of MIPs in
aqueous solutions. The proposed method integrated the processes of
SPE and LPME in a single step and improved extraction efficiency.
The microextraction bars were successfully used for the extraction
of IBA in the mung bean sprouts and further determined by HPLC.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SEM Characterization
Polypropylene
hollow fibers, with an inner diameter, wall thickness, and pore size
of 600, 200, and 0.2 μm, respectively, were cut into pieces
of 2 cm length (Figure 2A,C). Subsequently, one end of the segment was sealed with flame,
and the other end allowed packing of polymer particles. The MIP particles
of 38–75 μm were sonicated for 5 min in ethanol and formed
a slurry. Then the slurry was filled into the lumen of hollow fiber
capillary, which was 2 cm in length, with the help of a hypodermic
needle. The outer diameter of the needle is about 0.5 mm. The slurry
was passed by a syringe attached to the needle and sieved by the tubular
membranes. Ethanol passed through the pores of the membrane leaving
the polymer particles inside the lumen, and subsequently, they filled
up the hollow fibers. The microextraction bars were prepared after
sealing other ends of the fibers by flame (Figure 2B,D), and each bar contains about 1.2 mg
of polymer particles. Then the extraction bars were dried for 5 min
and impregnated with a nonpolar organic solvent before use. Then two
pieces of extraction bars were transferred into 4 mL of sample solution
and magnetically stirred. After extraction, the bars were immersed
in 2 mL of acetonitrile for elution of the analyte. The eluent solution
was analyzed by HPLC. Finally, hollow fiber bars were cleaned and
conditioned for the next extraction.

packed (B); cross section

2.2 Imprinting Effectivity and Selectivity
For the preparation of microextraction bars, MIP for IBA was designed
and synthesized. The MIP was prepared using vinylimidazole as the
functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker.
In our previous work,2 the recipe of the
imprinted polymer was optimized concerning the functional monomer,
cross-linker, and solvent in view of the molecular recognition of
IBA. The MIP and nonimprinted polymer (NIP) obtained were investigated
through breakthrough experiments using SPE cartridges, as shown in Figure 3. MIP presented higher
binding capacity (1.13 mg/g) to IBA than NIP (0.87 mg/g) did, and
the polymer showed an obvious imprinting effect in chloroform. The
MIP and NIP particles were packed into an HPLC column (50 × 4.6
mm), and retentions of IBA and its analogues (IAA, IPA and tryptamine)
were examined by HPLC. The selectivities of the polymers were also
evaluated by comparing the retention times of IBA and analogue compound
(Supporting Information, Table S1). It
can be observed that the MIP has high selectivity to IBA.

curves of MIP and NIP for 60 mg/L indole-3-butyric
acid in chloroform. The binding capacity value is extrapolated from
the 50% point of the breakthrough curves.

2.3 Evaluation and Optimization of MI-μ-SPE
Bars
In nonpolar solvents, MIPs usually show good imprinting
effects but almost no efficiency in aqueous solutions. MIPs give the
best recognition in polymerization solvents such as toluene, chloroform,
and acetonitrile. So, microextraction bars prepared with MIP particles
were immersed into nonpolar solvents before applying to the aqueous
sample. Here, the different organic solvents were investigated for
pretreatment of microextraction bars, as shown in Figure 4. The highest binding percentage
was achieved with chloroform as shown in Figure 4A. Compared to other hydrophobic solvents,
chloroform showed much higher binding to IBA. All these solvents can
extract IBA from aqueous solution. Without organic solvents, the binding
percentage was the lowest and much lower than that with organic solvents.
This indicated that liquid-phase extraction has an important contribution
to the overall extraction. MIPs usually have the best binding in the
polymerization solvent. Chloroform was used as the solvent for preparation
of the MIP against IBA. That is why the best binding was achieved
in chloroform. It can be proven that there is the synergic extraction
of LPME driven by chloroform and SPE driven by the MIPs.17 So, chloroform was chosen as the extraction
solvent for further studies. Compared to liquid–liquid extraction,
LPME and SPE, this method consumes much less organic solvent (about
50 μL). That is negligible and still can be regarded as a green
extraction process, although chloroform was used here.

Figure 4 Binding percentages and
desorption recoveries of IBA in different
organic solvents for pretreatment (A) and elution (B) after extraction
of 4 mL of IBA in aqueous solution at 2.0 mg/L.

For quantitative analysis, it was required to desorb IBA from polymer
extraction bars with a suitable solvent. Polar solvents such as methanol,
methanol/acetic acid (9/1), acetonitrile, and ethanol were investigated,
and the highest desorption rate (88%) was achieved with acetonitrile
(as shown in Figure 4B). It was also found that 5 min of desorption time was enough to
obtain satisfactory results. The extraction bars can be completely
recovered with acetonitrile and reused. The results of repeated experiments
showed that the extraction bars can be used over 30 times without
any obvious loss of extraction efficiency.

2.4 Orthogonal
Experiment Analysis
In
order to effectively utilize imprinted polymer extraction bars for
the clean-up of IBA from green bean sprouts, the extraction conditions
were investigated by the L9(34) orthogonal experiment.28,29 The conditions include extraction time, rotation speed, pH, and
concentration of salt (NaCl), as listed in Table 1. It can be seen from the analysis results
(Supporting Information, Table S2) that
contributions of the factors to the extraction are in the following
order: extraction time (A) > rotation speed (B) > NaCl concentration
(D) > pH (C). It was found that the optimum conditions were as
follows:
extraction time was 80 min, rotation speed was 800 rpm, sample pH
was 2.0, and NaCl concentration was 10%. Originally, we expect to
have better mass transfer due to the small diameter of the extraction
bar. However, the result indicates that it needs a long time of extraction.
That is because of poor mass transfer inside the fiber probably caused
by restriction of very small space.

2.5 Analytical Performance and Application to
Real Sample
Analytical performance and practical application
of the proposed method were investigated using mung bean sprouts as
a real sample. The auxin samples were collected and extracted using
the method described in our previous work.30 A calibration curve was established using HPLC for the quantification
of the eluents obtained from extraction bars (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The real samples were spiked within
the range of 5–20 mg/L (as shown in Table 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S2). The concentration of IBA in the green
bean sprouts was found to be 0.23 mg/L, and recoveries were in the
range of 88.9–106.4%. The RSD values were in the range of 1.86–2.22%,
which demonstrated that the method has high accuracy and reproducibility.

Analytical parameters of the proposed method were
compared with
those of other reported methods (Table 3). It clearly shows that the microextraction bars coupled
with HPLC detection exhibited excellent sensitivity, simplicity, and
high recovery. This method can be used for the determination of IBA
in green bean sprouts. Sorbents, which are used for simultaneous extraction
of auxins, are usually not very selective. In such work,31 pollen grains were used as hydrophilic sorbents
for simultaneous determination of 16 plant growth regulators. However,
the MIP not only has high specific binding to IBA but also has good
selectivity to its analogues. Combined with HPLC, it can give high
extraction of the auxins. In addition, this material is very useful
for the fast measurement of individual IBA combined with the spectrophotometric
method, typically where IBA is used alone for promoting plant growth.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, in this work, molecular imprinting
μ-SPE was
developed that combines the excellent features of both liquid–liquid
and solid-phase extractions. The new approach also effectively solved
the poor recognition of MIPs in the aqueous phase. This method also
allowed selective extraction of the auxin from green bean sprouts
and sensitive quantification by HPLC. In addition, it has advantages
of being simple, miniature, low consumption of organic solvents, and
high reproducibility.

4 Experimental Sections
4.1 Polymer Preparation
The rational
design approach was applied for the preparation of MIPs.23 Selection processes of the functional monomer,
cross-linker, and solvent were reported in our previous work.2 In brief, MIP and NIP were prepared according
to the following procedure: 0.203 g (1 mmol) of template (IBA) and
0.376 g (4 mmol) of vinylimidazole (VI) were dissolved in 3.548 g
of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in
a screw-capped glass vial. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min followed
by the addition of 3.172 g (20 mmol) of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate
(EGDMA) as the cross-linker and 0.071 g of initiator (AIBN). The polymer
solution was sonicated for 5 min and purged with N2 for
10 min and then sealed. After that, the solution was polymerized at
80 °C for 24 h in an oil bath. The bulk polymer was ground and
sieved to yield particles of 38–75 μm. Finally, the polymer
particles were washed with methanol/acetic acid (9/1, v/v) and methanol.
The same method was used to prepare NIP in the absence of templates
(IBA).

4.2 Breakthrough Experiment
For the breakthrough
experiments, MIP and NIP particles (100 mg) were packed in a 1 mL
SPE column. The SPE column was activated with 5 mL of chloroform.
The template IBA chloroform solution (60 mg/L) was loaded into the
SPE column with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Each extract was analyzed
by UV–vis spectrophotometers at 280 nm. Finally, the adsorption
amount of IBA was calculated by HPLC.

4.3 Preparation
of MI-μ-SPE Bars
The hollow fibers were cut into pieces
of 2 cm length and ultrasonicated
with acetone for 20 min. Subsequently, one of the ends of the segment
was sealed with flame, and the other end allowed packing of polymer
particles in the form of slurry (carefully weighed, m1). The MIP particles were homogenized by sonication with
ethanol for 5 min. Then the slurry was filled into the lumen of hollow
fiber capillary, and the excess ethanol leaked through the pores of
the membrane leaving the polymer particles inside the lumen. After
being packed, the other end was also sealed by flame and dried for
5 min. Finally, hollow fiber bars were carefully weighed (m2), and the packing amount was calculated according
to m1 and m2.

4.4 Pretreatment of Mung Bean Samples
One hundred grams of mung bean was put in a 200 mL beaker and washed
with distilled water. Under ambient temperature and humidity, water
was changed regularly 2–3 times per day. After three days,
the grown bean sprouts were collected and stored at −20 °C.
20 mL of NaH2PO4-H3PO4 buffer solution (pH = 9.0) was added into 5 g of mung bean sprouts
and kept in the dark overnight at 4 °C. The extraction solution
was centrifuged (9000 rpm, 5 min) by high-speed centrifugation. The
pH of the supernatant was adjusted to the desired value. Each μ-SPE
device was conditioned by ultrasonication in chloroform for 30 s.
Then, 4 mL of sample solution (0.1 mg/L NaCl, pH = 2) was added into
the glass vial for extraction. Finally, the conditioned hollow fiber
bars were transferred to 4 mL of sample solution and stirred for 80
min at 800 rpm. After extraction, the bars were washed with water
twice. Then they were immersed in 2 mL of acetonitrile stirred for
5 min at 800 rpm to desorb the analyte. The desorption solution was
analyzed by HPLC. Finally, hollow fiber bars were cleaned and conditioned
for the next extraction.
