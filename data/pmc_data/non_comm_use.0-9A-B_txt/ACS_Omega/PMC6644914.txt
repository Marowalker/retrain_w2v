Mesoporous
structures of α-Co(OH)2 have been selectively
synthesized by a simple one-pot sol–gel process using propylene
oxide as gelation agent. Synthesized material is investigated for
its crystal structure (crystallinity, phase), morphology (shape, size,
surface area, porosity), and electrochemical performance. The specific
capacity of the as-synthesized α-Co(OH)2 is 430 C/g,
when the electrodes underwent charge/discharge cycling in 6 M potassium
hydroxide at 1 A/g specific current. Enthrallingly, capacity retentions
of up to 86 and 80% were found over 2000 and 3000 cycles, respectively,
at a relatively high specific current of 10 A/g. The as-synthesized
material is studied as full cells or complete devices, wherein it
delivered capacities of about 80 and 25 C/g in symmetric and asymmetric
modes, respectively, at a current of 1 A/g. High capacity is ascribed
to the uniform porous nature of the material with considerable surface
area. With an extraordinary cycle life and charge-storage capacity,
the material prepared is an able contender for supercapacitor electrodes.

Introduction
Shortage of crude oil and global warming
have led to increased
focus on alternate energy-storage devices and conversion systems,
especially supercapacitors and batteries. There is an immediate need
for a breakthrough in this particular area of research so as to counter
the next-generation meager carbon and unceasing economy. Primarily,
rechargeable batteries are used in electric vehicles as power devices
and energy-storage devices, in the case of solar and wind energy harvesting.
Power density is the key issue related to these secondary batteries,
which arises due to the slow kinetics of cationic insertion/deinsertion
within the crystalline framework of electrode materials. Unlike batteries,
the fundamental mechanism which drives the high power density of supercapacitors
is the dependence of charge storage on the electrode surface reactions, either in electrochemical double-layer
supercapacitor or pseudocapacitive materials. The limitation of the
extent of possible reactions at or near the electrode surface tends
supercapacitors to possess lower energy density, which is a key point
to note. This tends us to put enormous effort in search of suitable
materials with higher energy density.1−8

Cobalt hydroxide is a promising material owing to its widespread
industrial applications as solar absorber, catalyst for oxygen evolution
reaction and oxygen reduction reactions, gas sensors, photovoltaic
cells, batteries, supercapacitors, etc.9−12 The hydroxides of cobalt are
familiar in crystallized α- and β-polymorphic forms. The
α-Co(OH)2 (hydrotalcite-like) is composed of stalked
monolayers of Co(OH)2–x with anions
like NO3–, CO3–, and Cl– intercalated. β-Co(OH)2 is isostructural with brucite-like molecular structures consisting
of octahedral layers of ionic cobalt with −OH ion coordinated.
Expanded interlayer spacing in α form compared to that in β
polymorph results in higher electrochemical activity.13 There are many successful synthetic routes, namely, hydrothermal/solvothermal,
precipitation, electrodeposition, and sol–gel methods. Among
these, the sol–gel method provides some advantages mainly concerning
the capacity to give a solid-state compound from a chemically homogeneous
starting material. Many complex inorganic materials like ternary/quaternary
oxides can be synthesized at lower processing temperatures and shorter
synthesis times by controlling the entropy of the solution state and
by effective atomic-level blending of reactants. Also, the sol–gel
chemistry enables control over material morphology and size.14−16

It is always necessary to understand and designate the nature
of
the electrochemical behavior of the material under study. In carbon
materials, a rectangular cyclic voltammogram is obtained, which is
its electrochemical signature due to electrochemical double-layer
capacitor (EDLC) arising from the potential dependency of the surface
density of electrostatically stored charges at the electrode interfaces.
Materials like MnO2/RuO2 exhibit a similar nature,
which derives from reactions that are faradaic in nature, involving
charge passage across the double layer. This pseuodocapacitance originates
from quick and reversible redox reactions involving interconversions
of redox states in the electrode material and the corresponding cationic
insertion from electrolyte. However, in faradaic or battery-type materials,
there exists dependency between charge stored and potential range,
which is nonlinear, and cobalt hydroxide is one such material.1,17

In this report, α-Co(OH)2 synthesized from
sol–gel
route using propylene oxide as a gelation agent is studied for its
electrochemical behavior as a supercapacitor electrode material.13 It delivers capacities of 430 C/g at 1 A/g and
110 C/g at a considerably high specific current of 20 A/g in 6 M KOH.
Interestingly, it retains 80% of initial capacity over 3000 cycles
at 10 A/g, attesting its reliability as supercapacitor electrode material.
Furthermore, it exhibits a high capacity of 80 C/g at 1 A/g in symmetric
mode and a capacity of 25 C/g in asymmetric mode.

Results and Discussion
In the preparation method, we adopted sol–gel route to synthesize
cobalt hydroxide. Gelation agent propylene oxide experiences protonation
of its oxygen and leads to the formation of substituted alcoholic
compound with consequent ring opening with nucleophilic anionic conjugate
base linkage (Cl– from CoCl2·6H2O and F– from NH4F). It consumes
H+ of the H2O and cobalt ions’ aqua complexes
promoting the [Co(H2O)6]2+ hydrolysis
to obtain Co(OH)2. Electronegativity of anions largely
affects the reactivity of epoxide-involving reactions, and the order
is F– > Cl– > Br– > I–. [Co(H2O)6]2+ will not be fully hydrolyzed if ammonium fluoride is not
used and
Cl– ions find the place in the crystal lattice to
form Co2(OH)3Cl phase. In the presence of NH4F, the more competing reaction of F– with
protonated epoxide can enhance the epoxide protonation by consumption
of proton from [Co(H2O)6]2+, resulting in full
hydrolysis of the complex producing cobalt hydroxide. Selective preparation
of pure α-Co(OH)2 mainly depends on the pH of the
system. Frequently used weak bases like ammonia, hexamethylenetetramine,
and urea during the synthesis are to be maintained in some regulated
conditions so as to have their optimum hydrolysis rate. Being exclusive
base, the alkalinity of epoxide is influenced by metal cation’s
acidity, i.e., Co2+, and if it is less acidic, alkalinity
of epoxide will be also low. It is the reason for the condition wherein
reaction between epoxide and the complex will not result in the evolution
of β-Co(OH)2 in the absence of NH4F. However,
pure α phase can be obtained if F– concentration
is regulated.13

Figure 1a presents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of as-synthesized Co(OH)2 powder. The diffraction signals are cataloged as α-Co(OH)2 (JCPDS file no. 74-1057). The prominent peaks at 2θ
values of 11.2, 23, 33, 34, 38.5, 45.5, 59, and 60.5° are related
to the planes (003), (006), (101), (012), (015), (018), (110), and
(113) respectively.13,18 No impurities are present in
the compound.

electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of α-Co(OH)2.

Figure 1b–e
depicts the TEM images in different magnifications of the synthesized
compound α-Co(OH)2, including higher-resolution image
(HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The
images (b) and (c) suggest amorphous and porous structures possessing
mass of tunnels in between the particles. The loosely packed porous
network leads to voids/tunnels from disorganized dispersal of α-Co(OH)2 particles. The HRTEM image of the sample in Figure 1d presents unambiguous lattice
fringes with a lattice plane space of 0.89 nm, related to the (003)
plane of α-Co(OH)2. The SAED pattern of α-Co(OH)2 (Figure 1e)
exhibits some distinct diffraction rings demonstrating typical polycrystalline
structure. This factor is in accordance with the XRD results.13,18

To examine the surface area and porosity of the synthesized
compound,
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were registered
(Figure 2a). The specific
surface area was determined from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) approach from adsorption curves of isotherms in the p/p0 range of 0.1–0.2.
Adsorption and desorption profiles show a loop at higher relative
pressure, reflecting porous essence of the compound. It is seen that
70 cm3/g of N2 is adsorbed at p/p0 = 0.99, possessing a specific surface
area of 14.1 m2/g. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) curves depict (Figure 2b) pore size distribution prominently at around 4 nm and narrow
distribution at 40 nm. Thus, the BET study infers the mesoporous character
of the synthesized α-Co(OH)2.

isotherm and (b)
BJH pore size distribution curve of the sample.

Electrochemical investigations of α-Co(OH)2 electrodes
were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge
cycling, and impedance spectroscopy in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Figure 3 depicts the results
of a three-electrode system. Figure 3a shows CVs of cobalt hydroxide electrodes in the voltage
range of −0.7–0.7 V at varied scan rates (5–100
mV/s). Strong peaks of currents related to faradaic redox reaction
can be observed in the voltammograms, which prove the faradaic type
of the transition-metal oxide/metal hydroxide-related compounds. This
clearly differs from EDLC, which generally gives a rectangular shape.
Higher peak current values with incremental scan rates prove the influence
of scan rate on currents, suggesting tremendous rate performances.
Co being a transition metal shows variable stable oxidation states
(Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+), thereby contributing to faradaic capacitance.10,15,16,19−22 The possible mechanism can be represented as follows. Furthermore,
voltammograms exhibit exceptional reversibility of the concerned electrode
processes. 1   2   3  Charge/discharge profiles
at different specific
currents are given in Figure 3b. The characteristics of these loops of same kind of discharge
plateaus are in accordance with their corresponding CVs and can be
attributed to the faradaic processes taking place in charge/discharge
cycling. The capacity values based on charge/discharge experiments
are shown in Figure 3c. The figure exhibits a superior SC of 430 C/g at a specific current
of 1 A/g and an SC of 110 C/g at an appreciably high specific current
of 20 C/g. As electrochemical stability, cyclability, and Coulombic
efficiency are the primary necessities of supercapacitor electrode
materials for practical applications, the materials were tested for
long charge/discharge cycles at high current. Figure 3d describes the electrode stability and Coulombic
efficiency of α-Co(OH)2 registered at 10 A/g for
3000 continuous cycles. Up to initial 500 cycles, the capacity was
found to fade and thereafter it gets stabilized up to around 3000
cycles. A remarkable performance of the compound is that it shows
86% capacity retention up to 2000 cycles and 80% up to 3000 cycles.
Coulombic efficiency was found to be around 86% at the beginning,
which got improved, reaching a maximum of 98% at the 2500th cycle
without larger fluctuations up to 3000 cycles. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) experiment was done to elucidate the electrochemical
nature of the materials. Figure 3e shows the Nyquist plot. It can be observed that the
curve is composed of a discreet high-frequency semicircle and a spike
in the region of low frequency. Ohmic resistance of the electrolyte
and intrinsic resistance of the electrode material contribute to solution
resistance Rs, which is located at the
crossing with the Z′ axis, possessing a value
of 0.5 Ω. Charge-transfer resistance Rct for the electrode is found to be nearly 1 Ω. In the
low-frequency region, the straight line immediately after the semicircle
is the Warburg resistance reflecting the diffusion process’s
kinetics of electrolyte ions on the electrodes. The slope of the tail
is clearly lower than the standard Warburg slope of 1, referring to
the faradaic nature of the reaction mechanism responsible for charge
storage.23,24

There are quite a few research findings on the supercapacitive
performance of cobalt hydroxides prepared from various routes, excluding
sol–gel processing. Chou et al. fabricated cobalt hydroxide
films on steel mesh and examined their supercapacitor application
in 1 M KOH. They exhibit 220 C/g at 0.1 mA/g and 81% capacity retention
over 3000 cycles.10 Wang et al. synthesized
cobalt hydroxide by following the precipitation route. They claimed
429 C/g at 1 A/g in 2 M KOH.25 Mondal et
al. used surfactant-free chemical route to synthesize β-Co(OH)2, which exhibits 249.6 C/g at 1 A/g in 1 M KOH.26 Carbon fiber loaded with α-Co(OH)2 was studied for its supercapacitive behavior in 1 M LiOH,
and it showed 193.3 C/g at 1 mA/cm2 with 92% capacity retention
over 2000 cycles.27 Du et al. published
the synthesis of microsphere of β-phase of cobalt hydroxide
showing an SC of 108.5 C/g at 2 A/g in 6 M KOH. Their hybrids with
graphene show 216.5 C/g.28 In the recent
past, Huang et al. have prepared flowerlike porous cobalt hydroxide
and its composites of graphene to study their supercapacitive behavior
in 6 M KOH. As-synthesized Co(OH)2 (surface area, 39.1
m2/g) showed an SC of 60 C/g and its graphene composite
(surface area, 97.9 m2/g) showed 192 C/g at 1 A/g.29 Thus, capacity values of 430 and 110 C/g at
1 and 20 A/g, respectively, are an extraordinary achievement of α-phase
of cobalt hydroxide synthesized by simple sol–gel route. A
significant value of capacity at reasonably high specific current
attests its high power capability. The superior electrochemical performance
of the material is ascribed to the known faradaic 1–3 involving the interaction
of metal hydroxide and KOH. Mesoporous characteristic with appreciable
surface area associated with significant pore volume significantly
adds to superior capacity by facilitating effortless riddling of ions
of the electrolyte, which essentially shortens the diffusion.

Figure 4a,c shows
the cyclic voltammograms of α-Co(OH)2 symmetric and
asymmetric capacitors. The voltammograms show appreciable reversibility
in both the cases. However, in the case of symmetric capacitor, CV
shows comparatively larger integrated area, indicating higher electrochemically
active and thereby high capacity. The charge/discharge profiles for
both symmetric and asymmetric capacitors are presented in Figure 4b,d, and the corresponding
capacity values are shown in Figure 4e. Symmetric capacitor delivers an SC of 80 C/g at
1 A/g compared to that of asymmetric mode with 25 C/g. Achievement
of the device in symmetric mode at 10 A/g is attractive, showing an
SC of 65 C/g. We further examined the energy and power densities of
the systems, and the results are presented in Figure 4f. Symmetric device performs better than
the asymmetric one. The symmetric device was able to deliver a high
energy density of 40 W/kg at the power density of 0.6 W/kg and still
kept a remarkable energy density of 32.5 W/kg as the power density
was increased to 8.1 W/kg. Superiority of the device can be credited
to Co(OH)2, which is a faradaic one, which contributes
from both the electrodes of symmetric capacitor.

Conclusions
We successfully designed
α-Co(OH)2 mesoporous
structures selectively through a simple sol–gel procedure.
The designed material exhibited a characteristic architecture of loosely
packed porous network. The as-synthesized compound exhibits an appreciably
great specific capacity of 430 C/g at 1 A/g and shows 86% retention
of capacity over 2000 charge/discharge sweeps and about 80% up to
3000 cycles. Symmetric capacitor showed 80 C/g, and asymmetric capacitor
showed 25 F/g at 1 A/g, which is quite interesting. This simple procedure
of synthesis results in the formation of α-polymorph of cobalt
hydroxide having unvaried porosity and remarkable surface area, which
could facilitate small charge and ion diffusion lengths and very high
transport rates. Therefore, propylene oxide-mediated sol–gel
synthesis is a versatile route to selectively aim at α-Co(OH)2 for supercapacitor electrodes with better specific capacities
and notable cycling stability.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of α-Co(OH)2
CoCl2·6H2O (2.86 g) and
NH4F (0.11 g) were
dissolved in 20 mL of double-distilled water to obtain a clear solution.
Precipitation agent propylene oxide (9.4 mL) was mixed with the above
mixture under stirring and a pink precipitate was formed after 30
min, which changes to green after a couple of hours under continuous
stirring. The resulting precipitate was kept under stirring for 12
h. The resulting compound was rinsed many times with distilled water.
The precipitate was dried in air at ambient condition.

Characterization
Methods
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns were recorded on a PANalytical diffractometer with Cu Kα
source (wavelength, 1.5438 Å). Surface area and pore size distribution
were calculated by Micromeritics surface area analyzer model ASAP
2020. X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded on an AXIS ULTRA X-ray
photoelectron spectrometer. Microscopic analyses were done using an
FEI Tecnai T-20 200 kV transmission electron microscope equipped with
an EDAX facility.

Preparation of Electrodes and Electrochemical
Characterization
For fabrication of electrodes, 70 wt % α-Co(OH)2, 15 wt % conductive carbon (Ketjen black), and 15 wt % poly(vinylidine
fluoride) were ground together. Some drops of N-methyl
pyrrolidone were added to the mixture to form a semisolid, which was
brush-coated on a carbon paper with an overall 1 cm2 geometrical
area and vacuum-dried at 100 °C. Coating and drying exercises
were duplicated to obtain the mass of active material in the range
of 0.8–1 mg/cm2 and finally dried for 12 h. A three-electrode
glass cell was designed using α-Co(OH)2-coated carbon
paper, platinum, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the working,
counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.

All potential
values are reported with reference to SCE. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were performed using
Bio-Logic SA multichannel potentiostat/galvanostat model VMP3. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (frequency window, 0.01
Hz to 100 kHz) with an alternating voltage perturbation of 5 mV were
made using Electrochemical Analyzer model CHI608C. Galvanostatic charge/discharge
cycling tests between −0.4 and 0.5 V were done, and the discharge
specific capacity (C) was calculated using the relation C = It/m, where I is the current, t is the discharge time,
and m is the mass of the active material loaded on
the electrode. In the case of two-electrode system or experiments
with full cell, the compound was coated on two carbon papers of 1
cm2 area and absorptive glass mat (soaked previously in
the electrolyte) was used as separator. The whole system was sealed
and evaluated for its electrochemical performance. In the case of
full cell in asymmetric mode, one of the electrodes was activated
