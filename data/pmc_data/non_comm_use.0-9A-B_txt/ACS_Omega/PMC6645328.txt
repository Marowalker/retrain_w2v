We
report a simple sol–gel process for the deposition of
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)–ZrO2 organic–inorganic
hybrid films at low temperature and studied their properties as a
function of the molar ratios of the precursors in the hybrid sol–gel
solution, which included zirconium propoxide as the inorganic (zirconia)
source, methyl methacrylate as the organic source, and 3-trimethoxy-silyl-propyl-methacrylate
(TMSPM) as the coupling agent to enhance the compatibility between
the organic and inorganic phases. The hybrid thin-film deposition
was done on glass slide substrates by the dip-coating method. After
deposition, the films were heat-treated at 100 °C for 24 h. The
analysis of the hybrid films included Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
to identify their chemical groups and thermogravimetric analysis to
determine the content of their organic and inorganic components. In
addition, capacitance–voltage (C–V) and current–voltage (I–V) curves in metal–insulator–metal structures,
using gold as metal contacts, were measured to find the dielectric
constant and leakage current of the PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid
films. Finally, because of their adequate dielectric characteristics,
single hybrid layers were deposited on indium tin oxide-coated glass
substrates and were tested as gate dielectric in thin-film transistors
(TFTs), using sputtered ZnO layers as the semiconductor active channel.
We measured the output electrical response and transfer characteristics
of these hybrid dielectric gate-based devices and determined their
main electrical parameters as a function of the TMSPM content in the
hybrid dielectric gate layer. The better TFT electrical behavior presents
field effect mobility of 0.48 cm2/V s, low threshold voltage
of 3.3 V, and on/off current ratio of 105, and it was obtained
by using PMMA–ZrO2 with 0.3 TMSPM content as the
gate dielectric layer. The values obtained for the electrical parameters
show that PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid films are quite suitable
for dielectric gate applications in TFTs

1 Introduction
Thin-film transistors
(TFTs) are currently of great interest for
potential applications in different portable devices,1 sensors,2 radio-frequency (RF)
identification tags,3 smart cards, and
backplane circuits for active matrix displays,4 among others. In recent years, the technology has been focused on
the development of new materials, which can be easily processed at
low temperature in large-area applications,5−7 low power consumption,
low operating voltage,7−9 and are compatible with different substrates for
transparent flexible electronics.10 The
organic–inorganic hybrid gate dielectrics address many of these
requirements and therefore represent promising materials.2−5,10 The transistor parameters critically
depend not only on the thickness and the dielectric properties of
the gate insulator but also on the interface formed between dielectric
and semiconductor layers, where the trapped charge has strong influence
on the device electrical behavior.2 For
a better interface, the hybrid gate dielectrics must have good compatibility
with either organic or inorganic semiconductors.11 The organic materials for dielectric gate applications
offer a smooth surface and good compatibility to grow organic semiconductors,
but they have low dielectric constant and therefore low capacitance.12 On the other hand, the high processing temperature
of inorganic dielectric materials with high k values
is not compatible with deposition on flexible plastic substrates required
in flexible electronics.5,13

The appropriated
combination of organic and inorganic phases in
organic–inorganic hybrid materials, strongly bonded at the
molecular level, is a new approach in the development of materials
with reinforced specific properties for a wide variety of applications.14 Many of these hybrid materials can be obtained
by the sol–gel method, which is a solution, low-temperature
process compatible with deposition on large-area substrates.10,15 Hybrid materials have been investigated for dielectric gate applications
in organic or hybrid electronic devices.4,5,10 A simple configuration, frequently employed, is a
hybrid organic–inorganic bilayer dielectric gate, where the
inorganic layer increases the capacitance and the organic one provides
a smooth surface at the dielectric–semiconductor interface.8 High-k inorganic nanoparticles,
such as ZrO214and TiO2,13 embedded in a polymeric matrix, such
as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone), have
also been tested as dielectric gate layers in TFTs. In this configuration,
the inorganic nanoparticles tend to agglomerate, increasing the surface
roughness of the hybrid layers, and the inorganic–organic interaction
is rather low, producing devices with rough interface and poor electrical
parameters, such as high gate leakage current3 and low on/off current ratio.8 Another
less-explored approach is the employment of class II inorganic–organic
hybrid layers,16−20 where the phases are much stronger linked through covalent and/or
ionic bonds at the molecular level. This class of hybrid materials
forms a cross-linked inorganic–organic network, the properties
of which depend on the amount of both phases and the chemical interaction
between them.18 If a proper link is attained
between organic and inorganic phases, the precipitation of phases
can be avoided, yielding a homogeneous hybrid network with high optical
transparency and smooth surface at the macroscopic level.16 In previous studies, we have reported a low-temperature
sol–gel process to deposit PMMA-based hybrid films.16−20 In this deposition process, the cross-linking between PMMA and some
inorganic oxides, such as SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, is attained through trimethoxy-silyl-propyl-methacrylate
(TMSPM) molecules as a coupling agent, with chemical groups compatible
with both inorganic and organic phases. The formation of the hybrid
material consists in the in situ polymerization of the organic phase
during hydrolysis and condensation of the inorganic one. Furthermore,
the properties of these hybrid films, including the dielectric ones,
can be adjusted by controlling the contents of organic and inorganic
components. This way, the PMMA–SiO2 and PMMA–TiO2 hybrid layers with good dielectric characteristics were obtained
and tested as dielectric gates in n-type ZnO-based TFTs with promising
results.16,19

In this work, we report the sol–gel
process to obtain highly
transparent, cross-linked, PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid films
deposited on glass and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates
at low temperature. The development of such a process was based on
our previous experience on the film deposition of PMMA–inorganic
oxide hybrid systems described above. The hybrid films were characterized
by several experimental techniques as a function of their organic
to inorganic content, and it was found, according to their dielectric
properties, that they were good candidates for dielectric gate layers
in TFTs. Therefore, TFTs with a ZnO/PMMA–ZrO2/ITO/glass
structure were assembled in a clean-room environment and analyzed
to determine their main electrical parameters, such as threshold voltage,
channel mobility, and Ion/Ioff current ratio as functions of the composition of the
hybrid dielectric gates.

2 Results and Discussion
The formation of the hybrid network was verified by identifying
the chemical groups of both phases, PMMA and ZrO2, in the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the three samples, shown
in Figure 1. The three
spectra display the same absorption bands with the intensity increasing
with the coupling agent content, which is basically due to the increasing
hybrid film thickness. In this graph, some absorption bands, the most
representative, are labeled with their corresponding vibration modes.
Centered at about 3350 cm–1 is observed the typical
wide and strong band attributed to O–H stretching modes, mainly
from Zr–OH groups resulting from the incomplete inorganic condensation
in the sol–gel process, which is due to the low temperature
of the curing process.4 The groups of the
organic phase produce the absorption bands observed at 2945, 1730,
and 1640 cm–1, which can be related to the stretching
vibration modes of the C–H, C=0, and C=C groups,
respectively.15 The C=C signal arises
from these groups, which are contained in the coupling agent and MMA
monomer molecules. These groups are the bonding point for the polymerization
of PMMA by free radicals,18 and their presence
in the hybrid material evidences some incomplete polymerization of
the MMA monomer. In the wavenumber region between 950 and 1230 cm–1, several vibration modes overlap: at 1075 cm–1, there is a band related to Si–C bonds of
the coupling agent molecules, at 1060–1100 cm–1, there is another band produced by the C–O–C stretching
vibration modes of the acrylic groups, and at 1126 cm–1, there is a band assigned to Zr–O–C, which evidences
some incomplete hydrolysis of zirconium propoxide (ZP). In the lower
wavenumber region, the absorption due to vibration modes of Si–O–Zr
groups, at 930 cm–1, has been reported due to the
interaction between the inorganic phase and the organic one through
the coupling agent molecule.17 The formation
of the inorganic ZrO2 phase in the hybrid material is corroborated
by the signals observed at ∼490 and ∼630 cm–1 related to the vibration modes of the Zr–O groups.21 Thus, FTIR analysis of the hybrid material shows
the formation of both organic and inorganic phases and evidences their
interaction through the coupling agent molecules. Furthermore, this
analysis also provides some insight into the reaction mechanism for
the formation of the organic–inorganic hybrid network. In the
beginning, Si–OH groups result from the hydrolysis of TMSPM
molecules. These bind with the Zr–OH groups of the inorganic
precursor, forming Si–O–Zr groups and then Zr–O–Zr
ones.17

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of the PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid layers with
different TMSPM content.

The high reactivity of the inorganic precursor (ZP) in the
aqueous
medium results in fast hydrolysis, favoring the growth of the inorganic
amorphous network constituted by Zr–O–Zr groups,21 which have affinity with one extreme of the
coupling agent hydrolyzed molecules. On the other hand, the free radical
method results in the polymerization of PMMA organic phase by breaking
the C=C groups of the MMA monomer molecules and binding to
the other extreme of the coupling agent molecules. This process occurs
with some selectivity due to the hydrophobicity of the organic molecules.

Figure 2 shows the
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements for the three types
of PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid films, where three stages of
weight loss were clearly identified for all of the samples.18 At low temperature, up to 230 °C, there
is a gradual, small weight loss between 4 and 6%, corresponding to
the release of residual solvents from the amorphous hybrid network
and due the condensation of hydrolyzed species, which remains inside
(as previously observed in the FTIR spectra), which is a nonoxidative
degradation.17 At a higher temperature,
up to 400 °C, there is a large and abrupt weight loss followed
by a small and gradual weight loss, which continues up to about 650
°C. The abrupt weight loss is related to the oxidative degradation
of PMMA as the organic component in the hybrid material.16 The subsequent gradual weight loss is associated
with the thermal decomposition of PMMA chains, which require more
energy to break due to their interaction with the inorganic phase
through the coupling agent.17 This portion
of PMMA is that which decomposes in the 400–650 °C temperature
range, and it is about 7–8% in the three hybrid samples. This
is because pure PMMA completely decomposes at 385–400 °C,
as reported in the literature.17 In the
600–1100 °C temperature range, there is no more weight
loss because the remaining solvents and organic phase have been completely
removed and only the inorganic phase remains. The remainder material
is constituted by the inorganic components: ZrO2 from the
inorganic source and SiO2 from the coupling agent component.
On the basis of this analysis, the weight content (%) of each phase
and remaining solvents in each sample were calculated, and the results
are shown in the inset of Figure 2 and plotted in Figure 3. The observed trend in these results is that the increasing
TMSPM molar ratio decreases the inorganic content in the hybrid samples,
increasing the organic one on the other hand. This is because the
coupling agent added to the hybrid network contains an acrylic group,
which has a larger mass than that of the silicate one.17 The same trend with the TMSPM content was reported
for the PMMA–SiO2 hybrid system.18

for the weight loss of the samples.

the PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid materials as a function of
the TMSPM molar ratio, determined by TGA analysis.

Figure 4 displays
the current density versus applied electric field characteristic curves,
obtained from I–V measurements,
for the metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structures with
the three types of hybrid insulator layers. It is observed that the
leakage current density is ranging from 10–6 to
10–5 A/cm2, increasing with the TMSPM
content in the hybrid insulator layer. These leakage current values
are comparable to those observed for other dielectric layers reported
in the literature.5,10,16 The dielectric constants of the hybrid layers were determined from
the C–V measurements of the
MIM structures (not shown). For this, the values of C, measured at several frequencies, were substituted in C = κεoA/d, where κ is the dielectric constant, εo is
the permittivity of free space, A is the area of
the capacitor, and d is the thickness of the hybrid
dielectric layer. The dielectric constant values, at different frequencies,
as a function of the TMSPM content in the PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid films are plotted in Figure 5. The dielectric constant values are in the 4–12
range, larger than the dielectric constant of the organic component
PMMA, which is k = 3.9,8 due to the contribution of the inorganic components.20 The remaining solvents, due to the low-temperature
processing, with high-polarizability groups and the presence of monomers
because of the incomplete polymerization also have some influence
on these rather larger values of the dielectric constants.20 The observed trend is that the dielectric constant
decreases with the TMSPM content in the hybrid films; therefore, according
to TGA measurements, it decreases with the increasing organic phase
content, as expected due to its lower dielectric constant. On the
other hand, the dielectric constant increases when the frequency is
reduced because at a lower frequency, there are more contributions
to the polarizability in the hybrid materials. The enhancement in
the dielectric response is another evidence of the appropriate integration
of the organic–inorganic components in the hybrid dielectric
layers.20 These results show that the PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid layers have appropriate dielectric characteristics
to be employed as a dielectric gate layer in devices like TFTs, where
low leakage current and high dielectric constant can enhance the device
performance.

corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device
cross section, where the constituting layers and their dimensions
in the stack (except the Al source and drain) are observed. The PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid layer in this image corresponds to that with 0.3 M
TMSPM content. As observed in this image, the thickness for the ITO
gate contact is around 150 nm, for gate dielectric layer, ∼65
nm, and for ZnO as active layer, ∼42 nm. The thicknesses of
the hybrid layers with 0.5 and 0.75 M TMSPM contents were 110 and
209 nm, respectively, as also measured by the SEM images of the layer
cross section.

gate, and aluminum as source and drain contacts and (b) SEM image
of the TFT cross section, where the PMMA−ZrO2 layer
was deposited with 1:0.3:1 molar ratio.

The electrical response of the hybrid dielectric gate-based
TFT
devices was analyzed from drain–source current (Ids) versus drain–source voltage (Vds) curves, measured at different gate–source voltages
(Vgs) (family curves) and drain–source
current (Ids) versus gate–source
voltage curves, measured at fixed Vds (transfer
characteristics). The latter measurements were fit to following eq 1(22,23) to determine the channel mobility, μsat, and threshold
voltage, Vt, parameters of the devices 1  where W and L are the width and length of the channel and CH is the capacitance per unit area of the PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid dielectric gate layer.

Figure 7 shows the
output characteristics of the ZnO-based TFTs with the three different
hybrid dielectric gate layers, containing (a) 0.3, (b) 0.5, and (c)
0.75 M TMSPM. In the three cases, the Ids–Vds curves were measured in the
voltage range from 0 to 6 V, at several gate voltages (Vgs), 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 V. All of these curves display
the typical output current of a TFT device with linear behavior at
low voltage and good current saturation at higher voltages. It is
observed that the saturation values of the current at the highest
applied Vds for different Vgs’s depend on the hybrid dielectric gate. The
saturation current at 6 V increases from about 0.5 mA to about 2.9
mA for the devices with hybrid dielectric gate layers containing 0.3
and 0.75 M TMSPM, respectively. On the other hand, Figure 8 shows the corresponding transfer
curves for the same TFT devices. On the left y axis,
the Ids current is plotted in semilog
scales, measured at Vds = 6 V, as a function
of Vgs for the three types of devices.
In these curves, it is observed that the current measured at both
lowest and highest applied Vgs voltages
increases for the devices with the hybrid dielectric gate containing
more TMSPM, which could be due to the influence of the leakage current
on the dielectric layers. In Figure 8a, for the device with dielectric gate containing 0.3
M TMSPM, the lowest value of the current, corresponding to the off-state
of this device, is on the order of 10–12 A. This
is a rather low off current (Ioff), and
it is comparable to the values observed in ZnO-based TFTs with inorganic
dielectric layers.24 Meanwhile, the current
values at the highest applied voltage correspond to the on-current
(Ion) of the device, which is on the order
of 10–7 A (almost 10–6 A); therefore,
the Ion/Ioff current ratio for this device is on the order of 105 (almost
106). In Figure 8b,c, the off-currents are not completely defined; however,
we can estimate the Ion/Ioff current ratios for these devices by taking the lowest
currents as the off-currents to obtain 104 and 102 for the devices with hybrid dielectric gates with 0.5 and 0.75 M
TMSPM contents, respectively.

PMMA–ZrO2 as the hybrid gate dielectric varying
the TMSPM content.

Figure 8 Transfer curves for ZnO-based
transistors and PMMA–ZrO2 as gate dielectric hybrid
films at different TMSPM molar
concentrations.

In the right y axis of Figure 8 are plotted the sqrt Ids versus Vgs curves of the three
devices, which were fit to eq 1 to determine their threshold voltage and channel mobility.
The scattered plots correspond to experimental data, and the solid
lines represent the best linear fits to eq 1. A clear trend is observed in the interception
of the solid straight line with the Vgs axis, which is the threshold voltage of the device; it decreases
with the increasing TMSPM content in the hybrid dielectric gate of
the devices. Because the threshold voltages are positive, the TFT
devices operate in the enhancement mode, that is, at Vgs= 0 V, the devices are in the off-state
and a positive gate bias is required to form a conductive channel
and thus turn on the devices. This is an important advantage for low
power consumption. It is also observed that when negative voltage
is applied, the current remains low, unlike some devices reported
in the literature in which undesirable leakage current is observed.3,4,8,15 The
low threshold voltage measured, in the 0–3.3 V range, in our
hybrid dielectric gate devices is a very convenient characteristic
also for low power consumption. These values are rather low in comparison
to other values measured in other ZnO-based10,19 TFT devices, even using inorganic dielectric gates, and other OTFTs
using organic or hybrid dielectric gates.3,13 On
the other hand, the channel mobility in our devices, on the order
of 10–1 cm2/V s, shown in Table 1, has similar values to those
of others reported in the literature for ZnO-based TFTs. The highest
value of mobility, 0.48 cm2/V s, was obtained in the devices
with hybrid dielectric gates with the lowest content of TMSPM (0.3
M). Table 1 summarizes
the electrical performance parameters determined for the ZnO-based
TFT devices as a function of the TMSPM content in the hybrid dielectric
gate. Here, the subthreshold slope, S, was determined
from the relation in eq 2.23 2  From these results, describing the electrical
response of the ZnO-based TFT devices, it can be concluded that the
PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid dielectric layers, processed by
the sol–gel method at low temperature, have very good performance
as a dielectric gate in the TFT devices. The hybrid dielectric gate
with 0.3 M content produced the best device with 0.48 cm2/V s channel mobility and 3.3 V threshold voltage. The on/off current
ratio is 105, which is higher than the values reported
in other works for ZnO-based devices using hybrid dielectric gates.19,23 Several factors concur in this hybrid dielectric gate layer to enhance
the device performance. The smooth hybrid layer with more inorganic
content produces a better dielectric–semiconductor interface,
which favors the low density of traps.20 The small thickness increases the capacitance, and the lowest content
of remnant solvent reduces the leakage current.

3 Conclusions
We reported here the low-temperature
deposition process and the
characteristics of hybrid dielectric layers obtained from a sol–gel
reaction among ZP, TMSPM, and MMA precursors at variable TMSPM molar
ratios. The resulting PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid layers were
employed as dielectric layers in MIM to determine the influence of
the TMSPM content on their dielectric characteristics. Furthermore,
the hybrid dielectric layers were tested as dielectric gate layers
in ZnO-based TFTs and the influence of TMSPM concentration on the
TFT electrical performance was also investigated. All of the TFTs
had low threshold voltage, channel mobility on the order of 10–1 cm2/V s, and on/off current ratio in the
range 102–105. The latter parameter had
more influence of the leakage current in the hybrid dielectric gate
layers. The devices with best performance parameters were obtained
with the hybrid dielectric gate layer containing the lowest amount,
0.3 M, of TMSPM, which had 3.3 V, 0.48 × 10–1 cm2/V s, and 105 values for threshold voltage,
channel mobility, and on/off current ratio, respectively. The characteristics
of larger amount of inorganic component, smaller thickness, and less
amount of remnant solvents in this hybrid dielectric layer yield to
improve its dielectric properties and then the better performance
of the ZnO-based TFT devices. The electrical parameters of this device
are comparable to those of other ZnO-based TFTs reported in the literature,
which uses organic, hybrid, and even inorganic dielectric gate layers.
That is why the PMMA–ZrO2 cross-linked hybrid system
represents a novel hybrid organic–inorganic dielectric material,
the low-temperature processing of which is quite appropriate for its
deposition on rigid or flexible substrates for the development of
flexible electronic devices.

4 Experimental Section
To prepare the sol–gel hybrid solution, zirconium propoxide
(ZP) was used as the inorganic precursor, methyl methacrylate (MMA)
as the source of the organic component, and 3-trimethoxy-silyl-propyl-methacrylate
(TMSPM) as the coupling agent. Benzoyl peroxide was used to start
the MMA polymerization. To hydrolyze the inorganic ZP precursor, ethyl
alcohol was used as the solvent and HNO3 as the catalyzer.
The TMSPM coupling agent solution was prepared using deionized water
and HCl. Three types of PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid films were
deposited from three hybrid precursor solutions obtained by mixing
the ZP, TMSPM, and MMA solutions with molar ratios of 1:0.3:1, 1:0.5:1,
and 1:0.75:1, respectively, where the TMSPM content is increased from
0.3 to 0.75, keeping the same ZP1 and MMA1 molar ratios. The hybrid films were deposited
by dip-coating on conventional glass slide substrates. Before deposition,
the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone (5 min), isopropyl
alcohol (5 min), and deionized water (5 min) and finally dried with
nitrogen. The velocity for both immersion and removal during the dipping
process was 3 cm/min. After deposition, the wet hybrid films were
baked at 100 °C in air (atmospheric pressure) for 24 h in a conventional
oven. The resulting hybrid films in the three cases were homogeneous,
highly transparent, and very well adhered to the glass substrates.
The PMMA–ZrO2 hybrid films were analyzed by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. The FTIR
spectra of the hybrid samples deposited on Cr/Au (10/100 nm)-coated
glass substrates were obtained using a Gx PerkinElmer system in the
reflectance mode (GA-ATR) with a resolution of 4 cm–1, in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm–1. The TGA experiments were performed using a TA Instruments SDT-Q600
TGA–differential scanning calorimetry, from room temperature
to 1100 °C under synthetic air flow (50 mL/min) using a heating
rate of 10 °C/min. The measurements were carried out using PMMA–ZrO2 powders obtained by using the same temperature and baking
time conditions as those used for the curing of the hybrid films.
Cross-sectional SEM images of the hybrid films were obtained in a
Zeiss Supra-40. The hybrid samples were coated with a thin gold layer
before the SEM measurements.

The dielectric characterization
of the PMMA–ZrO2 layers was done in MIM structures
fabricated by depositing the hybrid
layers on gold-coated glass substrates. The top gold electrodes (100
nm) were evaporated using a shadow mask to define top circular contacts
(50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 μm diameters). The current versus
voltage curves of the MIM structures were measured at room temperature
using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200), and a C–V analyzer (HP4284A; Hewlett Packard)
was used to measure their capacitance versus voltage characteristics,
at low and high frequencies (1 kHz to 1 MHz). For the fabrication
of TFT devices, a single layer of PMMA–ZrO2 was
deposited as a dielectric gate on ITO-coated glass substrates previously
cleaned in the same way as the glass substrates. Next, as the active
semiconductor layer, an n-type ZnO thin film (40 nm) was sputtered
on the hybrid dielectric gate using a commercially sintered ZnO target
(99.999%). The ZnO RF sputtering process was performed at room temperature
and using 50 W power. To complete the TFT structure, patterned source
and drain Al (100 nm) electrodes were evaporated through a metallic
shadow mask. The width of the Al electrodes was 500 μm, and
the channel length of the devices was 40 μm. The fabrication
of the devices was performed under clean-room environment (US-class
10 000) at the University of Texas at Dallas. A 4200 Keithley
semiconductor parameter analyzer was used to carry out current–voltage
(I–V) measurements at room
temperature to determine the electrical characteristics of the hybrid
gate-based TFT devices.
