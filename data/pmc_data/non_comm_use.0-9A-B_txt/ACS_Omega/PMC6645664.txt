Contamination of groundwater with
radioactive substances comprising
actinides and lanthanides is a significant environmental hazard and
thus the development of selective, sensitive, and easy-to-apply sensors
for water-soluble actinide and lanthanide ions is highly sought. We
constructed a new selective fluorescent sensor for UO22+, Sm3+, and Eu3+ based on a carbon
dot (C-dot)–aerogel hybrid prepared through in situ carbonization
of 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), a high-affinity heavy metal chelator.
The TTA–C-dot–aerogel enabled the detection of UO22+ ions, which induced a significant red fluorescence
shift, whereas Eu3+ and particularly Sm3+ ions
gave rise to pronounced fluorescence quenching. Importantly, the lanthanide/actinide
ion-selective TTA–C-dots could be synthesized only in situ
inside the aerogel pores, indicating the crucial role of the aerogel
host matrix both in enabling the formation of the C-dots and in promoting
the adsorption and interactions of the lanthanide and actinide metal
ions with the embedded C-dots.

Introduction
Varied industries and
utilities such as coal and phosphate mines,
fossil fuel power plants, and others generate substantial amounts
of natural albeit hazardous toxic metal ions in soil and groundwater.1 Environmental contamination with radioactive
species such as actinide ion UO22+ and long
half-life lanthanide fission products such as 151Sm3+ might also occur through intentional or accidental leakage
(e.g., the nuclear accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima). Human exposure
to these ions occurs through the oral, dermal, wound, or respiratory
routes, significantly increasing the risks of health hazards, including
carcinogenesis, tissue fibrosis, and pneumoconiosis.2−4 Accordingly, the development of sensors that can report on the presence
of lanthanide and actinide ions is critical for alerting and implementation
of strategies for the remediation of contaminated materials.5,6

Varied methods have been developed for the detection of lanthanides
and actinides, including potentiometric membrane sensors,7 sensing platforms based on colorimetric gold
nanoparticles,8 fluorescent molecular dyes,9,10 conjugated polymer sensors,11 and so
on. Fluorescent sensors, in particular, exhibit practical advantages
for metal ion detection in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, easy
operation, low cost, and availability of multiple sensing parameters.5,12 However, although numerous fluorescent sensors for metal ions have
been reported over the past several years,13−15 sensitive and
selective fluorescence sensors for the detection of lanthanide and
actinide metal ions are scarce. Specifically, significant practical
limitations of lanthanide and actinide sensors have been encountered,
including elaborate synthesis schemes, high cost of devices, and insufficient
selectivity and/or sensitivity.12,16

Carbon dots (C-dots)
constitute a family of fluorescent carbonaceous
nanoparticles (<10 nm) and have attracted significant interest
because of their unique structural and photophysical properties.17−19 C-dots can be synthesized from inexpensive and readily available
reagents using simple carbonization procedures.20−22 Importantly,
C-dots exhibit a broad range of excitation-dependent emission spectra,
which are sensitive to the local environments of the dots, making
possible the diverse sensing applications. In particular, metal ion
sensing with C-dots has been reported.23−25 An important aspect
of C-dot chemistry in the context of sensing applications is the observation
that these nanoparticles retain “structural memory”
of the carbonaceous precursors, effectively endowing the dots with
molecular recognition capabilities on the basis of functional units
of the precursor molecules.21 This remarkable
feature has been employed for designing varied C-dot-based sensing
modalities.21,26,27

Here, we report the construction of a new lanthanide and actinide
ion sensor comprising silica aerogel embedding C-dots prepared from
2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (abbreviated TTA) as the carbonaceous building
block. TTA, a β-diketone ligand (Scheme 1), has been employed as a scavenger for varied
metal ions through chelating, forming relatively stable, insoluble
complexes in aqueous solutions and organic solvents.28,29 TTA has been employed as a chelator for lanthanide and actinide
ions.30 In particular, the ligand facilitated
extraction of the ions in highly acidic solutions.31 TTA has been also used as a conduit for sensing applications;
low uranium concentrations could be detected, for example, via the
luminescence properties of uranyl–TTA complexes.32

Scheme 1 Structure of the 2-Thenoyltrifluoroacetone
(TTA) Ligand
Importantly, the TTA-based
C-dots were synthesized directly within
the pores of an aerogel framework. Aerogels, among the lowest density
solids known, constitute excellent materials for sensing applications
because of their porous structures and very high internal surface
area available for the adsorption of guest molecules.33,34 Varied types of aerogels have been synthesized, comprising silicon,
carbon, metal ions, organic polymers, and so on.34−38 Hydrophobic silica aerogels, in particular, have
been used as insulation materials in the aerospace industry,39 in the sorption of miscible organic solvents
in water,40 and as sensors for varied analytes
both in solution and in the gas phase.41,42

The
new hybrid aerogel, encapsulating in situ TTA-generated C-dots,
is capable of reporting on specific lanthanide and actinide ions in
water. We show that the fluorescence of the aerogel-embedded solid-phase
TTA–C-dots underwent ion-specific quenching or distinct red
shifts. The TTA–C-dot–aerogel construct is resilient,
easy to produce in large quantities, and could be effectively used
as a platform for the detection and speciation of lanthanide and actinide
metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of the TTA–C-Dot–Aerogel
Figure 1 illustrates
the simple in situ TTA–C-dot–aerogel fabrication method.
The aerogel host matrix was prepared through high-temperature silica
annealing in the presence of pressurized nitrogen gas.42 After aerogel synthesis and drying, the TTA
precursor was infiltrated into the aerogel pores through incubation
in a diethyl ether–water mixture and heating to generate the
aerogel-embedded C-dots. The TTA–C-dot–aerogel consisted
of easy-to-handle coarse powder, and it was resilient and stable at
room temperature for long time periods (months).

Figure 1 Synthesis of the TTA–carbon-dot–aerogel.
The TTA
precursor was initially incubated with the aerogel matrix. Subsequent
carbonization resulted in the formation of carbon dots inside the
aerogel pores. The red dots represent the graphitic carbon cores of
the C-dots, whereas residual TTA was retained on the surface of C-dots.

Figure 2 presents
the spectroscopic and analytical characterizations of the TTA–C-dot/aerogel
hybrid, both confirming the formation of C-dots within the aerogel
pores and retaining the porous aerogel framework. Typical excitation-dependent
emission spectra were recorded for C-dots inside the aerogel host
(Figure 2A). Notably,
significantly lower fluorescence emission, exhibiting different shifts,
was acquired when the C-dots were hydrothermally synthesized from
TTA in aqueous solution in the absence of aerogel (Figure S1). This observation indicates significant aggregation
of TTA–C-dots in solution and concomitant quenching of C-dots
fluorescence, attesting to the crucial role of the aerogel matrix
in C-dot formation and stabilization.

The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
images
of the TTA–C-dots extracted from the aerogel matrix underscore
the nanoscale dimensionality and crystalline nature of the carbon
nanoparticles (Figure 2B). The HRTEM image shown in Figure 2B reveals a relatively uniform size distribution of
the TTA–C-dots; C-dot diameters of 2.1 ± 0.5 nm were determined
through the examination of several TEM images (Figure S2). The HRTEM image shown in Figure 2B (right) underscores the crystalline graphitic
structure of the carbon cores of the C-dots, displaying the in-plane
lattice spacing of 0.215 nm corresponding to the [110] plane of graphite.21 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
further confirmed the structural integrity of the TTA–C-dots
(Figure S3).

We further examined
the effect of C-dot formation on the properties
of the aerogel matrix, particularly its overall porosity, a critical
parameter in the context of sensing applicability. Specifically, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analysis of the TTA–C-dot–aerogel, shown in Figure 2C, indicates a relatively
high specific surface area of 450 m2/g (Figure 2C,i), average pore diameter
of 4.8 nm (Figure 2C,ii), and pore volume of 0.51 cm3/g. These values are
similar to those of pristine aerogels (not containing embedded C-dots),
confirming that the open porous structure of the aerogel was retained
after the in situ synthesis process.

Fluorescence Sensing of
Lanthanide and Actinide Metal Ions
Application of the TTA–C-dot–aerogel
hybrid for the
detection of lanthanide and actinide ions is depicted in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3A
presents the fluorescence emission spectra recorded following the
addition of aqueous solutions of UO22+, Eu3+, or Sm3+ ions to the TTA–C-dot/aerogel.
The fluorescence spectra in Figure 3A reveal two distinct effects. Specifically, a significant
red shift of the emission peak, from 445 to 480 nm (excitation at
400 nm), occurred upon addition of UO22+ to
the TTA–C-dot–aerogel (Figure 3A). Importantly, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report on ion-induced red shift of C-dot fluorescence.
This shift is likely due to changes in electron density at the C-dots’
surface because of coordination of the UO22+/TTA chelating complex.43 Red fluorescence
shifts in case of conjugated polymers which form chelate with metal
ions have been reported and ascribed to the modulation of conjugation
network and surface electron densities.43 The other effect highlighted in Figure 3A is fluorescence quenching induced upon
addition of Eu3+ and Sm3+ ions to the TTA–C-dot/aerogel;
the quenching effect was particularly apparent upon excitation at
350 nm (Figure 3A,
right panel).

(C) Confocal fluorescence microscopy images (exc. 405 nm and emission

the fluorescence peak (λex 400 nm/λem 445 nm) and (B) intensity (λex 350 nm/λem 405 nm). Comparison of the (C) fluorescence shifts (λex 400 nm/λem 445 nm) and (D) fluorescence

(b) Sm3+, (c) Eu3+, (d) UO22+, (e) Ce3+, (f) Nd3+, (g) Gd3+,
(h) Cd2+, and (i) Pb2+. All ions were at a concentration
of 100 ppm.

To investigate whether
the significant ion-induced fluorescence
modulation of the C-dot–aerogel in Figure 3A (shifts of emission peaks or fluorescence
quenching) was due to the use of TTA as the carbonaceous precursor,
we further tested a C-dot–aerogel hybrid in which the embedded
C-dots were synthesized in situ from a different precursor, 6-O-(O-O′-di-lauroyl-tartaryl)-d-glucose (Figure 3B). Indeed, Figure 3B demonstrates that neither emission shifts nor fluorescence quenching
was induced upon the addition of UO22+, Eu3+, or Sm3+ ions to the C-dot–aerogel not
prepared from TTA as the carbon source. These results are significant,
as they clearly underscore the central role of the TTA units in determining
the sensing features of the new TTA–C-dot–aerogel hybrid.
The TTA–C-dot–aerogel system can also be employed for
sensing lanthanide ions through fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3C). The confocal
fluorescence microscopy images in Figure 3C (exc. 405 nm) show that the initial bright
fluorescence of the C-dot–aerogel particles was substantially
quenched upon addition of Sm3+ ions. Notably, a direct
relationship between Sm3+ concentration and the extent
of fluorescence signal attenuation was clearly apparent (Figure S4).

Figure 4 highlights
the sensitivity and selectivity features of the new TTA–C-dot–aerogel
hybrid. Figure 4A depicts
the concentration-dependent shifts of the fluorescence emission (excitation
400 nm) upon addition of UO22+, Sm3+, or Eu3+. Notably, only UO22+ induced
an experimentally significant fluorescence shift, recorded even in
low (<10 ppm) concentrations (Figure 4A). The graph in Figure 4B, depicting the fluorescence quenching (excitation
350 nm, emission 405 nm) versus ion concentrations, confirms the direct
relationship between metal ion concentrations and the extent of C-dots’
fluorescence quenching, indicating that adsorption of the ions within
the aerogel pores accounted for the fluorescence quenching effect.
Importantly, Figure 4B also indicates that the most pronounced fluorescence quenching
of the C-dots’ fluorescence was induced by the Sm3+ ion, reflected in the detection threshold of 0.5 ppm. Lesser, albeit
experimentally significant, fluorescence quenching was induced by
UO22+ and Eu3+ ions at higher concentrations.
Although metal-ion-induced quenching of C-dots’ fluorescence
has been widely reported,5,6Figure 4B provides an extraordinary demonstration
of selective lanthanide-induced fluorescence quenching via specifically
tailored C-dots.

The bar diagrams in Figure 4C,D highlight the selectivity of the TTA–C-dot–aerogel
platform. Significantly lesser fluorescence shifts (Figure 4C) or quenching (Figure 4D) was recorded upon addition
of ions such as Cd2+, Pb2+, and Na+ to the TTA–C-dot–aerogel. The selectivity of the TTA–C-dot/aerogel
hybrid for UO22+ (fluorescence shift) and Sm3+ and Eu3+ (fluorescence quenching) likely reflects
the high affinity of TTA toward these ions.44−46 The pronounced
binding of the ions to the TTA units at the C-dot surface affects
their surface energy states, likely accounting for metal-ion-induced
quenching of C-dot fluorescence.23 The
TTA-C-dots synthesized inside the aerogel host was extracted and excitation
dependent emission property was observed in Figure S5 which revealed the similar property like Figure 2A.

To further probe the
effects of the lanthanide and actinide ions
on the TTA–C-dots encapsulated within the aerogel matrix, we
carried out Raman scattering experiments (Figure 5). The Raman spectra in Figure 5 corroborate the fluorescence
data in Figures 3 and 4, indicating significant ion-dependent modifications
of the TTA–C-dots surface units. The Raman spectrum of the
untreated TTA–C-dot–aerogel (Figure 5i) exhibits several vibrations ascribed to
the TTA unit,47 including two main peaks
around 1418 cm–1 assigned to the symmetric C=C–C=C
stretching of the thienyl group and a vibration band at 1522 cm–1 assigned to the C=C–C=O stretching.

Figure 5 Raman
spectra of the TTA–C-dots–aerogel. Ion concentrations
were 100 ppm.

The effects of Sm3+ (Figure 5ii) and UO22+ (Figure 5iii) on the Raman
spectra were significant and attributed to metal-induced conformational
changes of the residual TTA on the C-dots’ surface. Specifically,
the main peak at 1417 cm–1 splits upon addition
of Sm3+, giving rise to a shoulder at 1447 cm–1. Likewise, the Raman signal at 1526 cm–1 is more
intense following the addition of either UO22+ or Sm3+ ions compared to that with the bare TTA–C-dot.
Notably, the peak at 1610 cm–1, corresponding to
the C=C–C=O unit coupled to the OH bending mode
(enolate form),48 disappeared upon incubation
of the TTA–C-dot–aerogel with UO22+ (Figure 5iii). This
spectral modification is ascribed to the interaction between the OH
group and the uranyl ion. Furthermore, the weaker vibrational bands
at 400–790 cm–1 in the presence of the two
ions may be traced to covalent interactions between the TTA–C-dot
and the metal ions.49,50 Overall, the Raman scattering
data provide structural evidence for both retention of the TTA units
on the C-dots and participation of the TTA residues in the interactions
with UO22+, Sm3+, and Eu3+. These interactions likely account for the significant fluorescence
shifts and changes in intensities induced by the ions.

Conclusions
We present a new fluorescent sensor for lanthanide and actinide
metal ions based on TTA-generated C-dots prepared in situ within the
porous framework of silica aerogel. The structural and physical properties
of both the aerogel matrix and embedded C-dots were retained following
the synthesis procedure. Importantly, the aerogel framework was critical
for the assembly of the fluorescent C-dots. The TTA–C-dot–aerogel
hybrid constituted a selective and sensitive fluorescence sensor for
UO22+, Sm3+, and Eu3+ ions,
which gave rise to significant red shift of the C-dots’ fluorescence
(in case of UO22+) or dramatic fluorescence
quenching (Sm3+ and Eu3+). The TTA–C-dot–aerogel
sensor exhibits notable practical advantages. Preparation of the hybrid
C-dot/aerogel material is straightforward, using inexpensive and readily
available reagents. The TTA–C-dot–aerogel can be stored
as a powder for long time periods. Sensing experiments are easy to
perform and can be carried out through either fluorescence spectroscopy
or microscopy. Importantly, the selectivity and sensitivity of the
C-dot–aerogel sensor are on par or better than those of most
lanthanide/actinide sensors reported thus far. This work further underscores
the versatility of C-dots/aerogel constructs as sensing platforms
for diverse analytes.

Aerogel Synthesis
Wet silica gel was prepared according
to previous reports.17,33 Briefly, 5 mL of TEOS, 15 mL
of anhydrous ethanol (EtOH), 5 mL of distilled water, and 5 μL
of concentrated hydrochloric acid were mixed in a 100 mL flask and
stirred in a 60 °C water bath for 90 min. Subsequently, 25 mL
of ethanol, 13 mL of distilled water, and 15 μL of NH4OH were added to the solution and stirred for 30 min at the same
temperature. The prepared wet silica gel was coated with parafilm
before it was further dried and transferred into 200 mL of anhydrous
ethanol and placed in a GCF1400 atmosphere furnace under an ultrapure
N2 gas atmosphere. The outlet was subsequently closed while
the ultrapure N2 was continuously passed into the autoclave
and it reached 1 MPa. The temperature was first raised quickly from
room temperature to 200 °C, increased slowly to 246 °C,
followed by 260 °C for 3 h at 2 MPa N2 gas pressure.
White silica aerogel was obtained after opening the autoclave.

In Situ Synthesis
of TTA–C-Dot–Aerogel
Around 50 mg of the TTA
precursor was mixed with 200 mg of aerogel
in a glass vial, and 300 μL of diethyl ether and 500 μL
of distilled water were added to the mixture. The suspension was then
sonicated for 5 min and heated at 140 °C for 6 h. The synthesized
C-dot–aerogel was purified by diethyl ether several times to
remove C-dots that were not embedded within the aerogel.

The suspension was then sonicated and heated at 125 °C for 2.5
h. The synthesized C-dots–aerogel was purified by CHCl3 several times to remove the unbound C-dots.

Ion Sensing
Metal ions were dissolved in distilled
water at different concentrations (1–1000 ppm). Then, 50 μL
of each ion was placed upon 50 mg of the C-dot–aerogel powder
and incubated for 10 min. Fluorescence of the C-dot–aerogel
slurry was recorded with different excitation wavelengths.

samples were prepared by placing a drop of solution on a graphene-coated
copper grid and observed with a 200 kV JEOL JEM-2100F microscope (Japan).
Fluorescence emission spectra of the C-dot–aerogel using different
excitation wavelengths were recorded on a Varioskan plate reader.

Life Sciences, Waltham, MA) equipped with an Axiovert-200 M microscope
(Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and a Plan-Neofluar 63×/1.4 oil
objective with 405 nm laser excitation wavelength. Raman spectra were
recorded with a Horiba-Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR 800 micro-Raman system,
equipped with a Synapse CCD detector. The excitation source was an
argon laser (514.5 nm), with a power of 5 mW. The laser was focused
with a 100× long-focal-length objective to a spot of about 1
μm. Measurements were taken with 600 g/mm grating and a confocal
hole of 100 μm with a typical exposure time of 1 min.
