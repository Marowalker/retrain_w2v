The
thermodynamic parameters of formation and clusterization of
aliphatic alcohols CnH2n+1OH and carboxylic acids CnH2n+1COOH (n = 6–16)
are calculated using the quantum-chemical semiempirical PM3 method.
Four types of dimers are constructed in two directions of the spread
monolayer comprising the most energetically advantageous monomer structures.
The hydrophobic chains of alcohol and carboxylic acid molecules in
the regarded dimers are found to be tilted within 12° to the
normal of the spread monolayer. The structures of the mixed and pure
surfactant dimers are the basis for the mixed alcohol–carboxylic
acid monolayers of the following types: two dimensional (2D) film
1 with single distribution of the individual component in the other
one, when the molecules of the first component do not interact with
each other but are completely surrounded by the molecules of the second
component; 2D film 2 with domain structure, when the film consists
of “islands” of the individual components. The dependences
of the clusterization Gibbs’ energy per one monolayer molecule
on the molar fraction of the components for the mixed 2D films 1 formed
by surfactants with equal alkyl chain length are found to be limited
from top to bottom by the corresponding dependences for pure components.
This indicates the absence of synergetic interaction between the hydrophilic
head groups of carboxylic acids and alcohols and conforms to the available
experimental data. The formation of the described types of mixed films
is competitive. The preferential formation of 2D films 1 with single
distribution of the first component among the molecules of the second
one is possible when the length of the carboxylic acid hydrocarbon
chain is longer by Δn = 1–2 methylene
units than that of the corresponding alcohol alkyl chain. According
to the fractionally linear law, the highest possible content of the
carboxylic acids in such 2D films 1 depends on the Δn value and does not exceed 33.3%.

Introduction
Although Langmuir monolayers have been
studied since more than
a century, they are of current and growing interest for offering unique
information about the organization of molecules in the two-dimensional
(2D) environment at the air/liquid interface.

The number of
publications per year has grown exponentially with
the development of new experimental techniques and is furthermore
on a high level, indicating the general interest in the advantages
of obtaining detailed information by model studies for more complex
systems.1

The development of novel
in situ methods at the air/liquid interface,
such as Brewster angle microscopy,2−4 grazing incidence X-ray
diffraction,5,6 infrared reflection absorption
spectroscopy,7 and surface selective sum
frequency generation,8 contributed decisively
to the experimental progress. Besides the enormous number of monolayer
studies of single amphiphiles, experimental investigations of two-component
systems concern mainly mixtures of nonionic amphiphiles (aliphatic
alcohols, carboxylic acids, and so on) with ionic,9,10 zwitter-ionic,11,12 and aromatic13 compounds. Essentially,
less papers deal with monolayer formation of nonionic surfactant mixtures,
for example, discussing the peculiarities of monolayers of fatty alcohol–carboxylic
acid14 or amine/carboxylic acid mixtures.15,16

The large-scale development of computers and of high-performance
algorithms renders possible the theoretical description of monolayers
using different kinds of molecular modeling methods, particularly
molecular dynamics simulation of surfactant monolayers.17,18 However, there are few theoretical papers modeling their behavior
during monolayer formation. Therefore, we developed an approach for
the description of 2D clusterization of nonionic surfactants (aliphatic
alcohols,19,20 carboxylic acids,21,22 amides,23 α-substituted carboxylic
acids,24,25 and so on) at the air/water interface. The
values obtained for the calculated alkyl chain length of the surfactants
enabling monolayer formation at a given temperature are in agreement
with the existing experiments and values of the structural parameters
of the corresponding monolayers. This encourages us to now use such
an approach for the description of mixed monolayers of nonionic surfactants.
The present work aims at the calculation of structural and thermodynamic
parameters during the joint clusterization of aliphatic alcohols CnH2n+1OH and carboxylic
acids CnH2n+1COOH (n = 6–16) at the air/water interface
under standard conditions.

Results and Discussion
Monomers
We carried
out the conformation analysis of
alcohol and carboxylic acid monomers in our previous papers.19−22 Two stable conformers were found for alcohols with the next values
of the dihedral angle of the hydroxylic group: ∠C2–C1–O–H
= 60° and 300° (−60°) (see Figure 1a). As in ref (19), the values of thermodynamic
parameters of the monomer formation were proved to be identical, we
use the alcohol conformer with ∠α = C2–C1–O–H
= 60° in the present calculations. The structure of the carboxylic
acid monomer is shown in Figure 1b. According to previous investigations,21,22 the structure with the dihedral angles ∠C2–C1–O1–H
= 180° and C3–C2–C1–O2 = −78°
is energetically most favorable. The surfactant monomers are in the
most extended all-trans conformation, as reported by the authors of
experimental investigations.26,27 Such monomer structures
are used for the construction of dimers and larger associates of alcohols
and carboxylic acids.

and carboxylic acids (b).

The calculated values of enthalpy, absolute entropy, and
Gibbs’
energy of monomer formation for alcohols and carboxylic acids agree
well with corresponding experimental values.28 They are listed in our previous papers21,22 devoted to the investigation of monolayer formation by individual
surfactants at the water surface. The calculated values of enthalpy,
absolute entropy, and Gibbs’ energy of monomer formation are
used for the correlation analysis of these values on the alkyl chain
length (Table 1). The
obtained regressions are linear with corresponding correlation coefficients
exceeding 0.9999.

Dimers
In this chapter, mixed dimers
of alcohols and
carboxylic acids are considered forming after further enlargement
of mixed monolayers when molecules of the individual surfactants do
not form domains but possess a single distribution of one component
into the other. For an extreme case, the fragment of such a monolayer
is shown in Figure 2, when alcohols and carboxylic acids are in the ratio of 1:1. Later
on, monolayers are regarded, when one of the components is larger.
In this case, it is also necessary to consider pure dimers of the
individual components. Therefore, one can single out four types of
mixed dimers (two in each of p and q directions of the spread monolayer) and two types of pure dimers
for both components of the mixed monolayer. Four series of mixed dimers
with the same number of methylene units in the alkyl chain n = 6–16 are built for further optimization of their
geometric structure. It should be noted that it is possible to create
mixed films with alcohols and carboxylic acids of different alkyl
chain length. Our previous study29 dealing
with penetration of alkanes into alcohol monolayers shows that the
calculation of mixed dimer structures with all possible options of
alkyl chains for individual components is virtually ineffective concerning
the values of the increments for the found CH···HC
interactions using the correlation analysis. Thus, we confine ourselves
to considering the series of mixed dimers with the same alkyl chain
length.

and carboxylic acids (1:1). Denotation of the basic dimers: 1—dimer

Optimized geometric structures
of the dimers are shown in Figure 3, where associates
of alcohols and carboxylic acids possess 10 methylene units in the
alkyl chain. For all mentioned dimer structures, we calculated the
thermodynamic parameters of their formation and clusterization. Enthalpy,
entropy, and Gibbs’ energy are calculated according to the
following formulas: ΔH298,mCl = ΔH2980 – d·ΔH298,mon(OH)0 – f·ΔH298,mon(COOH)0; ΔS298,mCl = ΔS2980 – d·ΔS298,mon(OH)0 – f·ΔS298,mon(COOH)0; and ΔG298,mCl = ΔH298,mCl – T·ΔS298,mCl, where ΔH2980 and ΔS2980 are the formation enthalpy and entropy of
the corresponding clusters at 298 K; H298,mon(OH)0, S298,mon(OH)0 and ΔH298,mon(COOH)0, ΔS298,mon(COOH)0 are
the formation enthalpy and entropy of alcohol and carboxylic acid
monomers at 298 K, respectively; m = d + f is the total number of the surfactant molecules
in the regarded cluster. The calculated thermodynamic parameters of
dimerization of pure and mixed dimers are listed in Table 2.

It should be noted that the structures
of the mixed dimers 1,p possess edge effects, that
is, the value of the dihedral
angle C3–C2–C1–O2 differs from the typical value
for the most stable monomer conformation. That is why the values of
the thermodynamic dimerization parameters for such structures are
absent in Table 2.
They are also not taken into account when constructing the general
correlation dependences of the thermodynamic clusterization parameters
on the number of intermolecular CH···HC interactions
realized in the regarded cluster. However, we constructed the mixed
tetramers of square structure (singled out with the blue dashed line
in Figure 2) to assess
the increments contributed by the interactions between the functional
groups of carboxylic acids and alcohols in dimers 1,p. In addition, we constructed two more types of linear tetramers
in q-direction of the spread monolayer, (see Figure 3), in which the monomers
of alcohols and carboxylic acids alternate.

The direct calculation
of pure and mixed dimers of alcohols and
carboxylic acids shows that alcohol dimerization is possible for compounds
with 10–12 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, whereas for carboxylic
acids, this threshold alkyl chain length is 18–20 carbon atoms.
The correlation dependences of the dimerization enthalpy, entropy,
and Gibbs’ energy on the number of CH···HC interactions
are obtained for mixed dimers to assess the contributions of the interactions
between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of monomers in the dimers.
The regression parameters of the partial correlations are listed in Table 3.

As is obvious from
the listed data, the contributions of one CH···HC
interaction in the dimerization enthalpy for mixed associates vary
within the limits of −(10.20–10.26) kJ/mol. Such difference
is statistically insignificant within the calculation error. So, this
allows uniting the partial correlations into a general one. In addition,
the listed values are virtually identical to the corresponding contributions
for pure dimers of alcohols and carboxylic acids. For dimerization
entropy, one CH···HC interaction contributes −(28.10–29.66)
J/(mol·K), that is, a somewhat higher modulo than the corresponding
values for dimers of the individual compounds. For dimerization Gibbs’
energy, the increment of one CH···HC interaction varies
within the scope of −(1.42–1.82) kJ/mol. The interactions
of the hydrophilic parts of surfactants in the mixed dimers contribute
insignificantly to the dimerization enthalpy except for dimer 2,q, and for pure dimers except for dimer_OH,p. For dimerization entropy and Gibbs’ energy, these increments
are almost the same for all mixed dimers within the calculation error.

As in our previous works,20,22 partial correlations
for mixed dimers (and square tetramer) are united into a general one 1   2   3  where Ka is a
number of intermolecular CH···HC interactions realized
in the regarded dimer. It can be found depending on the number of
the methylene units in the alkyl chain (nOH and nCOOH) of the surfactant according
to the next formulas:for pure
dimers of alcohols and carboxylic acids in
both directions of the spread monolayer, respectively

 4  for mixed dimers

 5  

The braces denote the integer part of the number. n1,p, n2,p, n1,q, and n2,q are
the identifiers
of the interactions between the functional groups of alcohol and carboxylic
acid in the dimer structures. If, for example, n1,p = 1, then such interaction realizes in
the regarded dimer, otherwise it does not.

Consider in detail,
how the number of CH···HC interactions
depends on the surfactant alkyl chain length in the case that they
are different. For example, if the alkyl chain length for alcohol nOH = 10 and for carboxylic acid nCOOH = 6 methylene units, then such a dimer has three
CH···HC interactions. For longer carboxylic acids with nCOOH = 7 or 8 and the same alcohol decanol,
the number of CH···HC interactions is one more (namely,
four) than in the previous case. For carboxylic acids with even longer
alkyl chains by 1–2 methylene fragments and the same decanol,
the number of CH···HC interactions in the dimer reaches
the maximum (with five). Further lengthening of the carboxylic acid
alkyl chain does not affect the number of CH···HC interactions
in case of the chosen alcohol. Therefore, the highest possible number
of such interactions is defined by the length of the shorter surfactant
in the considered pair. Before the maximum is reached, the number
of CH···HC interactions depends stepwise on the alkyl
chain length of the surfactant with the shorter hydrophobic part.

Figures 4–6 show the graphs of the dependences
of the dimerization parameters for mixed and pure dimers on the alkyl
chain length (in the case where nOH = nCOOH). Here, the black solid lines define the
dependences calculated according to the correlation eqs 1–3; the dots stand for the results of the direct calculations with
the PM3 method. The dependences for the pure dimers calculated in
the previous studies20,22 are also shown in Figures 4–6 for comparison. It is clear that the data of the direct calculations
are in good agreement with predicted values. As can be seen, dimer
1,p is energetically most advantageous among the
four types of mixed dimers. The formation of such mixed dimers is
also more preferable than pure alcohol or carboxylic acid dimers.
The formation of mixed dimers of other types is less preferable. However,
the formation of mixed dimers is slightly more advantageous than the
formation of pure carboxylic acid dimers.

Tetramers
Figure 7 shows the graphs
of the tetramerization Gibbs’
energy for mixed tetramers of the linear and square structures (see Figure 3) to illustrate the
energetic effect of alcohol–carboxylic acid interaction in
comparison to formation of pure clusters. Partial correlations for
tetramers of pure alcohols and carboxylic acids were obtained in our
previous studies.20−22,29 The corresponding parameters
for the dependences of tetramerization enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs’
energy on the number of CH···HC interactions in the
associates are listed in Table 3.

Figure 7 Dependence of variation of the clusterization Gibbs’ energy
for pure and mixed tetramers on the number of methylene units in the
surfactant alkyl chain.

As can be seen in Figure 7, the formation of mixed linear tetramers is almost
isoenergetic
with the formation of mixed linear tetramers of carboxylic acids and
essentially less preferable in comparison to the formation of alcohol
ones. The formation of square mixed tetramers is possible for compounds
with n = 12 methylene units in the alkyl chain. This
is an average value between alcohol and carboxylic acid threshold
alkyl chain length enabling aggregation to tetramers (10 and 14 methylene
units, respectively). Thus, it is possible to assume that interactions
realized between monomers in p-direction of the spread
monolayer are more preferable within the clusterization Gibbs’
energy than ones realized in the other direction. It may be caused
by the hydrogen interactions between hydrogen of the acid carboxylic
group and oxygen of the alcohol hydroxylic group realized in the associates
in q-direction. Our previous calculations21 have shown that the presence of hydrogen bonds
during the interaction of the surfactant polar parts leads to a more
positive contribution to the clusterization Gibbs’ energy.

The contributions of the polar head group interactions and CH···HC
interactions are singled out after the unification of the partial
correlations for dimers and tetramers. These contributions will be
used below for defining the thermodynamic clusterization parameters
for large and infinite 2D clusters using the additive scheme. It should
be noted that the increment of the CH···HC interactions
obtained for mixed and pure associates of alcohols and carboxylic
acids are almost the same: −10.27, −10.39, −10.10
kJ/mol for clusterization enthalpy and −25.12, −19.72,
−23.07 J/(mol·K) for clusterization entropy, respectively.
In addition, the structure is the same for mixed small clusters and
pure ones from the point of view of the number and type of CH···HC
interactions. Therefore, we united the partial correlation dependences
for mixed and pure clusters into a general one to construct the additive
scheme enabling calculation of the parameters for the joint clusterization
of fatty alcohols and carboxylic acids. The final general correlation
is in the next form 6   7   8  where n1,p, n2,p, n1,q, and n2,q are
the identifiers of interactions
between the functional head groups in the mixed associate as in the
corresponding mixed dimer structures; nOH,p, nOH,p, nCOOH,q, and nCOOH,q are the identifiers
of interactions between the functional head groups in the pure associates
of alcohols and carboxylic acids, respectively. If interactions between
the functional groups of the monomer head groups exist in the cluster,
the value of the corresponding identifier is equal to the number of
such interactions, otherwise this identifier is zero. Ka is the number of CH···HC interactions
realized in the regarded cluster.

Large and Infinite Clusters
This chapter deals with
two types of monolayers: 2D film 1 with single distribution of the
first surfactant molecules among molecules of the second one and 2D
film 2 of domain structure, when amphiphilic molecules associate into
homogeneous domains of the same molecules with their later linkage.

2D Film 1 with Single Distribution of the First Surfactant in
the Second One
Several structural fragments can be singled
out between carboxylic acid and alcohol molecules in 2D film 1 that
contribute to values of the clusterization thermodynamic parameters.
They are CH···HC interactions and four types of interactions
between the hydrophilic parts of carboxylic acid and alcohol. According
to Figure 2, these
interactions are identical in dimer 1,p and 2,p in p direction of the spread monolayer
and identical in dimer 1,q and 2,q in q direction. The interactions between the polar
head groups of the same surfactant type should also be taken into
account. The number of mixed interactions in p and
q directions is defined as n1,p, n2,p and n1,q, n2,q. The number of interactions between the
same surfactant molecules is defined as nOH,p, nOH,q for alcohols and nCOOH,p and nCOOH,q for carboxylic
acids. It is easy to determine the number of all interactions described
above independently of the orientation of the alcohol and carboxylic
acid molecules in the monolayer (provided the molecules of the component
with smaller molar fraction are not situated side by side but surrounded
by molecules of the component with bigger molar fraction) as 9  where X is the molar fraction
of the minor component in the associate or film; p and q are the numbers of molecules that construct
the cluster in the corresponding directions.

The dependence
of the number of CH···HC interactions on the alkyl
chain length is defined as 10  where nCOOH and nOH are the numbers of methylene units in the
hydrocarbon chain of carboxylic acids and alcohols, respectively;
the braces denote the integer part of the number.

To obtain
the parameters per one monomer molecule of 2D film, one
should use the procedure that became standard for such series of studies.
Expressions 6–8 should be divided by the total number of monomers in the cluster
(m = p·q).
After that, one has to calculate the limits of the resulting expressions
at infinite number of molecules in the cluster. Then, expressions 6–8 assume the next form
for the 2D film 1 (p = ∞, q = ∞) possessing all types of interactions between the functional
groups of the surfactants described above 11  

The number of
CH···HC interactions per one molecule
of the monolayer can be calculated according to the formula 12  

After substitution of eqs 11 and 12 in the correlation equations
for calculation of clusterization enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs’
energy, 6–8, one
obtains expressions for calculation of these parameters per one surfactant
molecule of the monolayer depending on the surfactant alkyl chain
length and molar fraction. In the case that XCOOH < 0.5, such expressions possess the forms 13   14   15  

If the molar fraction of carboxylic acids exceeds 0.5, the expressions
for clusterization enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs’ energy per
monomer molecule are 16   17   18  

Here, Ka∞/m is the number of
intermolecular CH···HC interactions per surfactant
molecule in the mixed 2D film 1 (see eq 12). As follows from the listed expressions,
the contribution of the carboxylic acid–alcohol interactions
to the clusterization Gibbs’ energy is almost identical to
the pure alcohol interactions and essentially more preferable than
pure carboxylic acid ones.

The dependences of ΔG298Cl,∞/m on the number of methylene fragments in the surfactant
alkyl chain
are shown in Figure 8 when the monolayer contains X = 10% mol of carboxylic
acids. Here, the black solid line corresponds to the formation of
the pure alcohol monolayer and the black dashed line to the formation
of pure carboxylic acid monolayer. The colored lines represent the
formation of mixed alcohol–carboxylic acid monolayers with
the given alcohol alkyl chain length and carboxylic acids with nCOOH = 6–22 methylene units in the alkyl
chain. As is evident from Figure 8, the shorter the carboxylic acid alkyl chain introduced
into the alcohol monolayer, the less preferable is the formation of
such a film in comparison to more long-chained alcohol. This is corroborated
by the fact that the number of CH···HC interactions
is smaller in case of inequality of alcohol and carboxylic acid alkyl
chain lengths in comparison to the maximum possible number for the
compound with longer alkyl chain. In addition, the energetic contribution
of carboxylic acid–alcohol interactions is slightly larger
than that for pure alcohols. Note that the increase of the carboxylic
acid molar fraction in the alcohol monolayer does not change the character
of the described dependences, but the colored lines are more extended
along the ordinate axis.

Figure 8 Dependence of variation of clusterization Gibbs’
energy
per surfactant molecule of mixed 2D films 1 on the number of the methylene
units in the surfactant alkyl chain (n) at XCOOH = 10% mol.

It is interesting to estimate the effect of the increase
of molar
fraction for one of the components on the preference of the mixed
film formation in the case that alcohols and carboxylic acids have
the same alkyl chain length. As is evident from Figure 9, the ΔG298Cl,∞/m dependences for mixed films are limited by the corresponding
dependences for pure components from both sides. Therefore, it is
possible to suppose that there are no synergetic interactions between
the two hydrophilic parts of the different surfactants. The formation
of mixed films is more favorable than pure carboxylic acid clusterization
but less favorable than the formation of pure alcohol films. This
is in agreement with the existing experimental data concerning the
study of surface pressure–molecular area (π–A) isotherms of pure and mixed monolayers of tetradecanol
and tetradecanoic acid.14 The formation
of monolayers with equimolar content of the components is most preferable
among other possible component proportions. This is called forth by
the fact that such monolayers possess the same number of CH···HC
interactions as monolayers of pure alcohols, whereas the number of
these interactions decreases with the increase of carboxylic acid
molar fraction in the mixture.

Figure 9 Dependence of variation of clusterization
Gibbs’ energy
per surfactant molecule of mixed 2D films 1 on the carboxylic acid
molar fraction X (n is the number
of carbon atoms in the surfactant alkyl chain).

2D Films 2 with Domain Distribution of Surfactants
In such
films, the amphiphilic molecules of the same class form clusters
surrounded by the clusters of the other component. Here, the interactions
between the hydrophilic parts of different surfactants should be taken
into account, as in our previous study devoted to alkane clusterization
in the presence of alcohols.30 However,
the number of such interactions in limit tends to zero when obtaining
the clusterization parameters per one molecule of the monolayer. That
is why the thermodynamic clusterization parameters of such films, A298Cl,∞,dom/m, can be calculated as weighted average sum of
the corresponding parameters for monolayer formation of pure components:
alcohol A298Cl,∞,OH/m and carboxylic
acid A298Cl,∞,COOH/m. That means, A298Cl,∞,dom/m = X·A298Cl,∞,COOH/m + (1 – X)·A298Cl,∞,OH/m, where, X is the molar fraction
of the carboxylic acid in the mixed monolayer. The contributions of
the interactions realized between the alcohol hydrophilic parts are
−1.44 kJ/mol for clusterization enthalpy, −111.52 J/(mol·K)
for entropy, and 31.79 kJ/mol for Gibbs’ energy. For carboxylic
acids, these contributions are −170.82 J/(mol·K) and 50.90
kJ/mol for entropy and Gibbs’ energy, respectively, whereas
for clusterization enthalpy, the increment of the head group interaction
is statistically insignificant. Then, the expressions for calculation
of the thermodynamic clusterization parameters per surfactant molecule
of the mixed 2D films 2 are as follows 19   20   21  where, X is the molar fraction
of carboxylic acids in the monolayer; Ka∞/m is the number of intermolecular CH···HC
interactions per surfactant molecule in the 2D film and depends on
the number of methylene units in the surfactant alkyl chain (n) as 2·{n/2}.

The graphical
dependences of clusterization Gibbs’ energy per surfactant
molecule of mixed films with domain structure are shown in Figure 10. Here, the black
solid line corresponds to ΔG298Cl,∞/m for pure tetradecanol, and the black dashed line corresponds to
ΔG298Cl,∞/m for carboxylic
acids with n = 6–16 methylene units in the
alkyl chain. The group of colored lines corresponds to the dependences
of ΔG298Cl,∞,dom/m for mixed
films with the domain structure obtained on the basis of tetradecanol
and carboxylic acid homologues with different content in the monolayer.

Figure 10 Dependence
of ΔG298Cl,∞,dom/m on
the carboxylic acid content in the films (X, % mol)
at given alcohol alkyl chain length (tetradecanol is taken as an example; n is the number of methylene units in the surfactant alkyl
chain).

It is interesting to discover
how the alkyl chain length of carboxylic
acids and alcohols affects the preferable formation of the considered
types of mixed films. The thermodynamic condition of preferable formation
of a mixed monolayer with single distribution of one component among
another in comparison to a monolayer with the domain structure is
the following inequality 22  

It is necessary
to take into account that ΔG298Cl,∞/m for 2D film 1 can be generally expressed as 23   24  where, X is molar fraction
of carboxylic acids in the alcohol monolayer; Ka∞/m is the number of intermolecular CH···HC
interactions per surfactant molecule in the 2D film; U is the contribution of one CH···HC interaction to
the clusterization Gibbs’ energy (−3.81 kJ/mol); VOH and VCOOH are
the contributions of hydrophilic head group interactions for individual
surfactants: 31.79 and 50.90 kJ/mol for alcohols and carboxylic acids,
respectively; and A is the contribution of hydrophilic
head group interactions in the mixed pairs “alcohol–carboxylic
acid” (47.61 kJ/mol).

For 2D films 2 with domain structure 25   26  

When subtracting eqs 25, 26 from 23 and 24, respectively, it is possible to obtain the expression
for ΔΔG298,∞Cl/m. This expression
is valid for any value of X (from 0 to 1) 27  where, X is molar
fraction
of carboxylic acids in the alcohol monolayer; and ΔKa∞/m is the number of intermolecular CH···HC
interactions per surfactant molecule in film lost because of the difference
in the alkyl chain lengths of alcohols and carboxylic acids.

As it follows from eq 12, the value of ΔKa∞/m depends
on the alkyl chain length of the corresponding surfactants and the
molar fraction of the components in the monolayer. The value ΔKa∞/m can be calculated as 28  where, nCOOH and nOH are the numbers of the methylene
units in
the hydrocarbon chain of carboxylic acids and alcohols, respectively;
the braces denote the integer part of the number.

Finally, the
inequality 27 transforms into
the following 29  

The value of  is equal to 0 or 1 (for even and odd values
of n) if both surfactants possess the same number of CH2-units in the alkyl chain. After substitution of the contributions
for all interactions and on account of the previous fact, it is found
that  should exceed 1 or 2. This means that the
formation of mixed films with single distribution of surfactant among
the molecules of the other component is advantageous if the carboxylic
acid alkyl chain length is longer than that of the corresponding alcohol
by 1–2 methylene units. For example, the structure of the 2D
film 1 is more favorable than that of the 2D film 2 for octanol or
nonanol (nOH = 8 or 9) and carboxylic
acids from undecanoic acid (nCOOH = 10
methylene units in the alkyl chain except for the carbon atom of the
carboxylic group). In case of decanol and undecanol, the corresponding
carboxylic acids should have more than 12 methylene units in the alkyl
chain.

It is also necessary to determine the content of surfactant
mixtures
when the 2D film 1 is more preferred provided the condition described
above is fulfilled. The clusterization Gibbs’ energy per surfactant
monomer for 2D film 1 can be expressed in the following way 30  where, ΔG298Cl,∞,OH/m is the clusterization Gibbs’ energy for
alcohol with the given alkyl chain length.

Δn is the difference of the surfactant alkyl
chain lengths; X is molar fraction of carboxylic
acids in the alcohol monolayer; A′ corresponds
to the value of the X held constant in eq 21; and U has the
same meaning as in eqs 23–26.

The clusterization Gibbs’
energy per surfactant monomer
of the 2D film 2 can be written down in the following form 31  where, ΔG298Cl,∞,OH/m is the clusterization Gibbs’ energy for
alcohol with the given alkyl chain length; Δn is the difference of the surfactant alkyl chain lengths; X is the molar fraction of carboxylic acids in the alcohol
monolayer; and U, VOH, and VCOOH have the same meaning as
in eqs 23–26.

Using the condition (eq 22) mentioned above, it is possible to obtain
the expression
for X when the formation of 2D film 1 is more advantageous
than 2D film 2 32  

The obtained
fractionally linear dependence can be illustrated
using hexadecanol (nOH = 16) and carboxylic
acids with nCOOH = 8–22 methylene
units in the alkyl chain taken as an example. As is evident from Figure 11, the elongation
of the carboxylic acid alkyl chain in comparison to the chosen alcohol
leads to a change of the monolayer structure. For example, hexadecanol
and carboxylic acids with nCOOH = 8–16
methylene fragments in the alkyl chain form mixed films with domain
structure at any component proportion (see Figure 11a,b).

Figure 11 Dependence, ΔG298Cl,∞/m, on the
carboxylic acid content in films (X, % mol.) at given
alkyl chain length of alcohol (hexadecanol taken as an example) and
carboxylic acid: (a) nCOOH = 14, (b) nCOOH = 16, (c) nCOOH = 18, (d) nCOOH = 20, and (e) nCOOH = 22.

However, if the carboxylic acid length reaches nCOOH = 18 methylene units, the alkyl chain length difference
Δn = 2. According to the condition (eq 29) described above, this
leads to more preferable formation of 2D films 1 with single distribution
of carboxylic acid molecules in the alcohol monolayer. Such preference
is preserved for the carboxylic acid content X ≤
21.5% mol (see Figure 11c). In case that carboxylic acid has even longer hydrophobic chain
in comparison to the chosen alcohol, the preferable carboxylic acid
content increases to X ≤ 26.2 and 28.2% mol
for carboxylic acids with nCOOH = 20 and
22.5, respectively (see Figure 11d,e). As follows from eq 32, the maximum content of carboxylic acid
is X = 33.3% mol for the limiting case, when the
difference in carboxylic acid and alcohol alkyl chain lengths tends
to infinity.

The obtained data agree with the results of the
experimental studies
for mixed monolayers of tetradecanoic, pentadecanoic, and octadecanoic
acids with tetradecanol and hexadecanol. The authors of ref (14) give the dependences of
equilibrium pressure for the LE-LC phase transition on the carboxylic
acid content. These dependences are linear and possess a kink point
that can be associated with the possible change of the monolayer structure.

Conclusions
This study introduces a theoretical analysis
of the joint film
formation of aliphatic alcohols CnH2n+1OH and carboxylic acids CnH2n+1COOH (n = 6–16) at the air/water interface in the framework of the
quantum-chemical semiempiric PM3 method. The calculation of the thermodynamic
parameters of formation and clusterization of small mixed aggregates
shows that destabilizing contributions of interactions of the surfactant
hydrophilic parts to clusterization Gibbs’ energy are inessentially
smaller than the corresponding contributions for pure carboxylic acids
and exceeds the contributions for pure alcohols. This allows the assumption
that the absence of synergy between the regarded surfactants is lacking
while the formation of mixed monolayers.

Two types of mixed
films are considered: 2D film 1 with single
distribution of the first component in the second and 2D film 2 with
the domain structure. The conditions for the competitive formation
of these films are dependent on the surfactant alkyl chain lengths
and their content in the mixture. The calculations show that the preferable
formation of 2D film 1 is possible, provided (1) the carboxylic acid
alkyl chain is longer than that of the corresponding alcohol by 1–2
methylene units and (2) the carboxylic acid content should not exceed
the value  (in the limit 33.3% mol at Δn → ∞).

The proposed approach can be the basis for theoretical studies
of other binary mixtures of nonionic surfactants at the air/water
interface. It enables us to predict the structure of possible mixed
monolayers depending on the surfactant alkyl chain length and molar
fraction in the mixture.

Method and Model of Calculations
The calculation of the thermodynamic parameters of the joint clusterization
of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids at the air/water interface
is done using the quantum-chemical program package Mopac 200031 in the framework of semiempirical PM3 method.
This method is parameterized within the formation heats32,33 and describes adequately the experimental data concerning the monolayer
formation by different nonionic surfactant classes19−22 despite some restrictions.34

The calculation of the thermodynamic clusterization
parameters
of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids is carried out using the
quantum-chemical model described in details elsewhere.35 Here, we provide only its key points:intermolecular CH···HC
interactions between
the methylene units of the hydrocarbon chains of the interacting surfactant
molecules contribute mainly to the value of the clusterization Gibbs’
energy;

intermolecular CH···HC
interactions are
additive in pairs;

influence of the interface
is taken into account implicitly
via its orientating and stretching effect on the surfactant molecule,
when it is in the all-trans conformation;

thermodynamic clusterization parameters of the regarded
surfactants are calculated using supermolecular approximation;

the additive scheme is constructed using
data obtained
for small clusters (dimers, trimers, and tetramers). It represents
the values of the thermodynamic clusterization parameters as total
contributions of the CH···HC interactions realized
in the cluster and the interactions between the hydrophilic parts
of the surfactants. This scheme takes into account only the CH···HC
interactions realized between the methylene units of the nearest surfactant
molecules as the energy of the intermolecular interaction declines
rapidly proportionally to r–6;

on the basis of the described additive scheme,
the thermodynamic
parameters of film formation are calculated using the limiting values.
