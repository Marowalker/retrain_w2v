Silica-based carrier is a promising
material for recovery of metal
and nonmetal contaminants in chemical oxo-precipitation-fluidized
bed crystallization (COP-FBC) system. Boron species are an essential
element for plant growth and can cause health concerns in human beings
at high concentrations in water environments. The composition of thin-film
transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) contains a wide variety
of metal oxides and can be tailored as promising functional mesoporous
carriers for boron crystallization recovery in the presence of barium
ions and hydrogen peroxide. In this study, waste-derived mesoporous
aluminosilicate (MAS) nanomaterial in the presence of barium ions
and hydrogen peroxide was used as a carrier for sustainable recovery
of crystallized boron, a priority wastewaters pollutant. The MAS shows
the hierarchically homogeneous distribution of nanostructured aluminosilicate
particles with an average size of 12.8 ± 3.6 nm on the surface
after the activation with Na2CO3 at 1000 °C.
Moreover, the negatively charged surface and the mesoporous structure
of MAS enhance the adsorption of Ba2+ onto MAS, and the
Langmuir adsorption capacity of 105 mg/g is achieved, which is conducive
to the enhancement of the recovery of boron species. Moreover, the
recovery efficiency and crystallization ratio of boron by MAS can
be up to 84.5 and 93.4%, respectively. The cross-sectional scanning
electron microscopy images and the high-temperature X-ray diffraction
results confirm the boron recovery mechanism that the negatively charged
functional group as well as the mesoporosity of MAS triggers the rapid
formation of needle-shaped precipitates of barium peroxoborate, and
then converted to barium borate after calcination at 1050 °C.
Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate the possibility
of fabricating environmentally benign mesoporous aluminosilicate adsorbents
from TFT-LCD waste to sustainably recover and crystallize boron species
from water and wastewater in COP-FBC.

Introduction
Boron (B) is an element
with a number of complex compounds such
as boric acid, borate, and perborate in hydrosphere and lithosphere.1 These compounds are commonly used in a wide variety
of industrial purposes and result in increased environmental concerns
after their release into water bodies.2,3 Usually, highly
soluble boron elements are easily associated with charged molecules,
making boron species extremely difficult to be harvested from water
and wastewater.3 Although boron is an essential
element for plant growth, the long-term exposure to high concentrations
of boron would result in toxic effects on human health such as coronary
artery, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.2,4,5 Due to its possible hazard on human beings
and ecology, boron has been promulgated as a priority pollutant and
the guideline level in drinking water is 2.4 mg/L by the World Health
Organization.4,5 Consequently, the need of control
technology for an effective recovery of boron as well as conversion
of precipitates into high-value products gives rise to the development
of sustainable technology for boron treatment and recovery.

Over the past decades, several technologies have been employed
for the removal of boron species from effluent streams, namely, chemical
precipitation,6,7 electrocoagulation,8,9 ion exchange,10 adsorption,11,12 chemical oxo-precipitation (COP),13,14 and COP with
fluidized-bed homogeneous crystallization (COP-FBHC).15 COP is the peroxolysis process of boron species, which
combines oxidant and chemical precipitation for precipitate transformation
from BaB(OH)3OOB(OH)3 and Ba(B(OH)3OOH)2 to the crystallized BaB(OH)2(OO)2B(OH)2 at room temperature,14−16 COP is an efficient
method for the treatment of elevated concentrations of boron in comparison
with the chemical precipitation. Usually, the addition of divalent
metal salts such as calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and barium (Ba2+) along with H2O2 is needed to promote the formation of metal perborate. Barium ions
are regarded as the most suitable ions because of the formation of
barium perborate.17 Although COP and COP-FBHC
exhibit good efficiency in the recovery of high concentrations of
boron, several challenges including the production of high water content
sludge13 and the difficulty in the disposal
of sludge are experienced because of the homogeneous precipitation
process.

To overcome the disadvantage of producing large amounts
of sludge,
COP with fluidized-bed crystallized (COP-FBC), a heterogeneous crystallization
using active silica-based particles as carriers in COP reactor, has
been developed to reduce the produced amount of sludge as well as
to enhance the crystallization ratio.18,19 Several studies
have shown that FBC has a good removal and crystallization efficiency
on the removal of nonmetal elements such as phosphorous18 and fluoride.19 However,
the sand carriers used in COP-FBC are usually nonporous and have a
low surface area, which is relatively difficult in promoting the nucleation
for boron recovery in the presence of Ba2+. It is noted
that several mesoporous materials including SBA-15,20 MCM-41,21 and titanate nanotubes22,23 have been used to adsorb divalent metal ions. However, the use of
mesoporous materials as carriers for COP-FBC to effectively remove
boron as well homogeneously crystallize boron-based precipitates in
the presence of divalent metal ions has received less attention. It
is therefore imperative to look for cost-effective mesoporous materials
as COP-FBC carrier to rapidly recover boron by crystallization of
boron species in the presence of barium ions.

TFT-LCD panel
contains a high content of valuable material including
glass, plastic and precious metals and different approaches for the
recovery of glass from end-of-life liquid crystal display24,25 such as zeolite26 and soda lime silicate
glasses.27 Usually, TFT-LCD can undergo
thermoalkaline treatment and the impurities like metal and metal oxides
can be removed by acid washing.28 However,
the fabrication of silica-based mesoporous materials from TFT-LCD
has received less attention. A previous study has indicated that a
mesoporous aluminosilicate composite can be prepared from the TFT-LCD
waste panel for an effective adsorption of heavy metal ions including
Ni, Cu, and Zn.29 Waste-derived mesoporous
aluminosilicate (MAS) is environmentally friendly, has a high surface
area and a narrow-distributed pore size, and a surface that can be
easily tailored. All these features make it a suitable nanomaterial
to serve as a COP-FBC carrier for the adsorption of Ba2+ as well as for the recovery of boron ion by crystallization of barium
perborate, although MAS has never been used for this scope yet.

In this study, the mesoporous aluminosilicate (MAS) nanomaterial
fabricated from the waste TFT-LCD panels serves as a carrier of COP-FBC
to enhance the adsorption capacity of Ba2+ and the crystallization
efficiency of boron. Moreover, the boron-containing precipitates are
then calcined to form crystalline materials for the recovery of boron.
As shown in Scheme 1, the waste TFT-LCD panel is melted at 1000 °C in the presence
of Na2CO3 to produce hydroxyl-functionalized
MAS, which can enhance the adsorption of Ba2+ by ion exchange.
Ba-MAS is then used as a carrier in the COP-FBC reactor to provide
the crystallization affinity toward boron recovery via the formation
of barium peroxoborate (BaB2(OO)2(OH4)) precipitates in the presence of H2O2. The
identification of the crystallized phase change in the morphology
of Ba-MAS before and after COP-FBC indicates that boron can be recovered
as a high purity of BaB2O4. Results of this
study clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using novel MAS from
the waste TFT-LCD panel for the enhanced recovery of boron elements
in wastewater, which can open a gateway to design an environmentally
friendly treatment technology from the industrial wastes to simultaneously
recover metal ions and inorganics.

Results and Discussion
Surface
Characterization of Silica Sand and MAS
The
surface morphologies of commercial silica sand and the as-prepared
MAS were first characterized and compared by electronic microscopic
images. As illustrated in Figure 1a, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of
silica sand shows a well-rounded pattern with a smooth, fractured,
irregularly cratered, and nonporous surface. The original waste TFT-LCD
material shows large fragments with an unmelted and nonporous surface
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). This
large fragment is mainly from the angular flaky particles within a
broad range of particle size after ball milling.30 The SEM image of MAS after alkali treatment with Na2CO3 at 1000 °C is given in Figure 1b, which shows many roughly
small particles with a multilayered assembly. The particle size of
MAS, produced after the alkali and heat treatment, is in the range
of 0.2–9.0 μm. Moreover, the cross-sectional field emission
transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) images of MAS was further
studied from the red box of Figure 1b to elucidate the change in surface morphology, and
the result is shown in Figure 1c. It is clear that a wide range of nanostructured particles
appear on the surface of MAS. In addition, the MAS shows a homogeneous
distribution of nanoparticles on the surface, which form a hierarchical
structure of aluminosilicate after Na2CO3 treatment
and calcination at 600 °C for 6 h. As shown in Figure 1d, the distribution of MAS
particles exhibits a narrow particle size range of 4–22 nm
with an average lateral size of 12.8 ± 3.6 nm (n = 105), which indicates that MAS can provide a large specific surface
area and pore channel to serve as a superior carrier for the recovery
of boron species. It is noted that our previous study also used TFT-LCD
to prepare the mesoporous aluminosilicate using the thermoalkaline
reaction. The mean particle size is 12.1 ± 3.9 nm after calcination
at 110 °C for 12 h,29 which is similar
to the results obtained in this study.

sand and (b) MAS nanomaterial, (c) cross-sectional
FE-TEM image of MAS, and (d) particle size distribution of MAS.

Figure 2a shows
Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectra of silica and MAS after
the alkali treatment at 1000 °C. The FTIR spectra of silica sand
show a broad peak at 3502 cm–1, which is the stretching
vibration of the −OH bond and/or bending vibration of the adsorbed
H–O–H bond from water molecules.31 The peak at 1090 cm–1 belongs to Si–O–Si
stretching, while that at 800 cm–1 in the silica
sand spectra belongs to Si–O bending. After activation with
Na2CO3, the MAS spectrum also exhibits a strong
peak of hydroxyl functional group (−OH) at 3490 cm–1 and that of carbonyl group (C=O) at 1635 cm–1 in comparison with the silica sand. Another distinct peak located
at 1007 cm–1, which belongs to the T–O–···Na+ bond, is originally
derived from the cleavage of T–O–T′ linkages
(where T and T′ is Si or Al)32 at
1095 cm–1 (Figure S2,
Supporting Information) after Na2CO3 activation.33 Moreover, the X-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns
of MAS after activation treatment in the presence of Na2CO3 show several peaks at 13.9, 24.3, 30.1, 34.5, 38.1,
41.5, and 42.6°, which can be assigned to the (110), (211), (310),
(222), (321), (400), and (411) planes of amorphous sodium aluminum
carbonate silicate (ICDD-PDF-00-015-0469) (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The formation of amorphous silicate
is mainly attributed to the fact that the aluminoborosilicate of TFT-LCD
panel was blended with excess Na2CO3 during
the melting process at a high temperature of 1000 °C.

isotherm and (d) pore size distribution of the commercial silica sand
and the as-prepared MAS nanomaterials derived from the waste TFT-LCD.
Insets in figure (c) and (d) are the enlarged figures of isotherm
and pore size distribution of silica sand, respectively.

The surface chemistry of silica sand and the as-prepared
MAS was
further studied to characterize the change in elemental species. Figure 2b shows the scan
survey spectra of silica sand and acid-treated TFT-LCD panels of MAS
nanomaterials. Several XPS peaks at 102, 153, 284, and 532 eV appear
in the commercial silica sand spectra, which can be assigned to Si
2p, Si 2s, C 1s, and O 1s, respectively. This result clearly indicates
that the silica sand only contains SiO2. The small peak
of C 1s at 284 eV is mainly attributed to trace organic carbons from
the atmosphere. Moreover, several additional peaks centered at 74,
347, 1073, and 1304 eV are clearly observed in the MAS spectrum, which
are mainly contributed from Al 2p, Ca 2p, Na 1s, and Mg 1s, respectively.
The distinct peak of sodium atoms at 1073 eV can be assigned to the
Si–O–Na+ bond.34 Our previous study has reported that the Na2O–B2O3 phase can be removed during the activation process,
and then the exposure of oxygen atoms would produce Si–OH or
Si–O···Na+ functional group after
acid washing.29 Therefore, the borosilicate
TFT-LCD waste can be completely tailored as the sodium aluminosilicate
framework of MAS after the activation.

Pore Texture of Aluminosilicate
Materials
The pore
texture including specific surface areas and pore size distribution
of silica sand and MAS was further examined. As illustrated in Figure 2c, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the silica sand material
can be classified as a type III isotherm with a slight hysteresis
loop at a relative pressure range (P/P0) of 0.9–0.95.35 In
addition, no obvious pore size distribution pattern is observed (Figure 2d). This result clearly
indicates the nonporous nature of silica sand, and the hysteresis
loop at a high P/P0 range
is mainly attributed to the interparticle voids of silica sand. In
contrast to silica sand materials, the adsorption–desorption
isotherm of MAS material follows a type IV physisorption isotherm
with an H3 hysteresis loop in the P/P0 range of 0.4–0.98, which is mainly attributed
to the capillary condensation in mesoporous structures.36 Moreover, the pore size distribution of MAS
exhibits a sharp peak at 3.9 nm and then follows a broad pore size
distribution in the mesoporous region (2–50 nm). The peak of
3.9 m is mainly attributed to the hierarchically pore structure of
nanoparticles, while the broad distribution is from the voids of the
interparticles of MAS. Moreover, the specific surface area is 0.6
m2/g for the commercial silica sand and 226 m2/g for MAS after the activation from waste TFT-LCD (Table S1, Supporting Information), which indicates that the
activated MAS can serve as a potential carrier for COP-FBC treatment.

Adsorption of Ba2+ by MAS
The adsorption
efficiency of barium ions by the treated TFT-LCD panel-based material
(MAS) was investigated at pH 5. The selection of a weakly acidic condition
is to avoid the precipitation of Ba2+ in solution. Figure 3 shows the adsorption
isotherm of Ba2+ by silica sand and mesoporous MAS materials
at 25 °C. The silica sand material exhibits little capacity for
Ba2+ adsorption, probably attributed to the low specific
surface area and the lack of functional groups. On the contrary, the
mesoporous MAS material is an excellent adsorbent of Ba2+ in comparison with silica sand. The adsorption of Ba2+ ion by MAS increases dramatically at a low equilibrium concentration
of <50 mg/L and then levels off to a plateau in a high equilibrium
concentration range of 75–250 mg/L.

Figure 3 Adsorption isotherms
and the fitted Langmuir model of silica sand
and MAS for Ba2+ adsorption.

The adsorption behavior of divalent metal ions onto mesoporous
material can be described by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models.37Table 1 shows the fitted parameters of Langmuir and Freundlich models.
The Langmuir isotherm model can accurately describe the adsorption
of Ba2+ by MAS mesoporous material, and the correlation
coefficient (R2) is >0.995. Moreover,
the maximum adsorption capacity of Ba2+ is 105 mg/g. A
previous study has used the surface-modified 2D titanium carbide to
enhance the adsorption of barium ions, and the adsorption capacity
of Ba2+ was 46.5 mg/g,38 clearly
indicating the superior ability of the developed MAS nanomaterials
toward metal ion adsorption.

model	Freundlich model

MAS	105	0.014	0.999	4.36	3.71	0.863	
The high adsorption efficiency of
Ba2+ by MAS can be
attributed to the high mesoporosity and the functionalization of MAS
during the activation process, which can not only produce a mesoporous
structure for the removal of Na2O–B2O3 phase structure but also increase the functional groups and
electrostatic sites for Ba2+ adsorption. The negatively
charged functional groups on the surface of aluminosilicate (T–O–) can be counter-balanced by the addition of Na+ cations from the activation agent of Na2CO3 to form T–O–···Na+ clusters.29 Besides, Ca2+ and Mg2+, serving as charge compensators of AlO4– clusters, would migrate into the aluminosilicate
surface when the Al-containing tetrahedral network is ruptured.32 Therefore, the negatively charged surface and
mesoporous structure of MAS enhance the adsorption of Ba2+ onto MAS, which may provide high affinity toward the nucleation
of barium peroxoborate precipitate during the boron recovery in the
COP-FBC process.

Boron Recovery by COP-FBC
Since
the adsorbed Ba2+ onto the MAS may increase the crystallization
of borate
precipitates, the recovery efficiency as well as the crystallization
ratio of boron by silica sand and MAS was used to evaluate the performance
of COP-FBC process on boron recovery at the [H2O2]/[B] and [Ba]/[B] ratios of 2 and 1, respectively, at pH 10.5. Figure 4a shows the recovery
efficiency of boron by silica sand and MAS as a function of reaction
time in the COP-FBC process. It is clear that the recovery efficiency
of boron by the commercial silica sand increases slightly from 62.9%
at 10 h of incubation to 76.1% at 100 h. The MAS exhibits a better
and stable recovery efficiency of boron, and the efficiency of 91.2–94.8%
is observed after 100 h of incubation.

Figure 4 Comparison of the boron
recovery performance of silica sand and
MAS in terms of (a) removal efficiency, (b) crystallization ratio,
and (c) effluent concentration as the function of reaction time in
the COP-FBC process at pH 10.5.

The crystallization ratio also shows a similar trend. As illustrated
in Figure 4b, the crystallization
ratio of boron increases from 45.8% at 10 h to 69.2% at 100 h by silica
sand, while the crystallization ratio of 82.7–93.4% is observed
when MAS was used as the carrier. A previous study has used the COP-FBC
process to recover boron in the absence of a carrier and obtained
a crystallization recovery of around 60%.15 In this study, the high crystallization ratio of boron ions is mainly
attributed to the high surface area of MAS and the high adsorbed amount
of Ba2+ onto the surface, which can easily facilitate the
nucleation and subsequently results in fast crystallization within
10 h. Therefore, the high crystallization property of MAS adsorbents
produces less sludge in comparison with the commercial silica sand.
In addition, the boron concentration in the effluent can be maintained
at a relatively low level in the presence of MAS. As shown in Figure 4c, the boron concentration
in the effluent of the COP-FBC process decreases from 35.8 mg/L at
10 h to 23.5 mg/L at 100 h. In contrast, the boron concentration in
the effluent decreases rapidly to 6.5 mg/L in the first 10 h and then
maintains at the similar concentration after 100 h of incubation,
clearly demonstrating the superiority of MAS for boron recovery and
crystallization.

A wide variety of COP processes including pure
COP and COP-FBHC
in the absence of a carrier have been used to remove/recover boron
in aqueous solutions.14,15,17Table 2 compares
the recovery efficiency and crystallization ratio of boron with the
reported results. Lin et al. investigated the effectiveness of boron
recovery by COP using H2O2 and barium ions as
promoters14 and found that peroxoborate
precipitates were transformed from the amorphous BaB(OH)3OOB(OH)3 and Ba(B(OH)3OOH)2 to the
crystalline BaB(OH)2(OO)2B(OH)2.
Vu et al. used COP-FBHC to reclaim boron as the calcium perborate
pellets to minimize the production of sludge and calculated the crystallization
ratio to be around 60%.15 Moreover, Shih
et al. added H2O2 into the COP system to promote
the treatment efficiency of boric acid in the presence of barium ions
and obtained an enhanced boron removal efficiency of 98.5%.17 Although good recovery efficiency of boron by
COP-FBHC is observed, the crystallization ratio is not high and a
large amount of sludge is produced, which needs further treatment
and recycling.

b Recovery that does not take into
account the boron produced from the activation of TFT-LCD.

c Recovery that takes into account
the boron produced from the activation of TFT-LCD.

In this study, the addition of MAS
into the COP-FBC reactor shows
a similar recovery efficiency of boron but a high crystallization
ratio in comparison with those reported for COP and COP-FBHC processes,14,15 clearly indicating that MAS is an excellent carrier to promote the
precipitation of borate species as well as to enhance the crystallization
ratio. The high crystallization ratio can be attributed to the high
porosity and functionalization of MAS materials during the activation
process, which enhance the ion exchange and electrostatic attraction
sites to facilitate a strong interaction between barium ions and diperoxodiborate
dianion (B2(OO)2(OH)42–). Therefore, boron species can be recovered through the formation
of barium peroxoborate. It should be noted that the original TFT-LCD
glass contains boron as N2O–B2O3, which is washed away during the activation process. Therefore,
MAS itself would produce certain amount of boron that is supposed
to be recovered by COP-FBC. This decreases the recovery of boron by
COP-FBC from 94.8% originally to 84.5% when taking into account the
total washed amount of boron from TFT-LCD. Since the boron species
in COP-FBC will be recovered and crystallized, the MAS can, therefore,
be recycled and reused for the sustainable removal of boron from wastewater.

Identification of Peroxoborate Precipitates
Since boron
in solution can be reacted with barium ions to form peroxoborate precipitates
in the presence of H2O2, the change in the chemical
structure as well as the crystallinity of precipitates at various
reaction times was further identified using Raman spectroscopy and
high-temperature XRD. Figure 5a,b shows Raman spectra of the precipitates produced from
reactions based on silica sand and MAS, respectively, at various reaction
times. The Raman spectra of the precipitates from the silica sand
shows four distinct peaks at 745, 875, 1060, and 1553 cm–1. The peak at 875 cm–1 is the contribution of the
symmetric BO3 stretching of B(OH)3 and O–O
stretching of H2O213,39 and the band at 1553 cm–1 is attributed to the
O–O stretching of oxygen.14,15 Bands at 745
and 1060 cm–1 likely arise from the asymmetric [B(OH)4]− stretching of metaborate due to the υ1 symmetric (B–O(OH)) of metaborate14 and symmetric (B–OH) stretching of H3BO3,40 respectively. This means
that the precipitate from silica sand is an amorphous perborate and
the chemical structure is B(OH)3(OOH)−.14 It is clear that the peak intensities
at 875 and 1060 cm–1 increase upon increase in the
reaction time, which means an increase in the crystallization of the
precipitates with time.

Figure 5 Raman spectra of the precipitates produced from
the recovery of
boron in the presence of (a) silica sand and (b) MAS as a function
of reaction time. (c) HT-XRD patterns for crystallized products by
MAS carrier in COP-FBC after 216 h of incubation.

The Raman spectra of the precipitates produced from the MAS system
are different from those from silica sand. Although the bands in the
Raman spectra of the precipitates produced by MAS are similar to those
by silica sand, the crystallization of MAS-based precipitates is more
rapid and several sharp peaks at 711, 934, and 987 cm–1 associated with υasym (B2(OO)2), υsym (O–O), and υsym (B–O)
are observed, respectively.14,39 In addition, the peak
intensity increases with increase in the reaction time from 8 to 216
h, which indicates that the reaction of perborate with peroxo groups
produces cyclic dimeric peroxoborate (B2(OO)2(OH)4)2– by linking two peroxo bridges
with two four-coordinated boron atoms.14,39 It is noteworthy
that the crystalline structure of barium peroxoborate (BaB2(OO)2(OH)4) is rapidly formed in the presence
of MAS carrier because of considerable absorbed amounts of barium
onto the MAS surface. These results clearly demonstrate the superiority
of MAS to rapidly produce crystallized precipitates within 8 h in
comparison with silica sand, which needs 216 h for crystallization.

To further understand the possible structure of the recovered precipitates,
high-temperature XRD (HT-XRD) was further used to in situ identify
the change in the crystallization of MAS-based products at various
temperatures. As illustrated in Figure 5c, HT-XRD patterns show that the structure of peroxoborate
(BaB2(OO)2(OH)4) changes from a well-crystallized
phase originally to an amorphous phase at 200–500 °C.
However, the crystallinity of BaB2O4 changes
again when the samples are sintered to 600 °C. The lattice constants
of a = 11.13 Å, b = 12.67 Å,
and c = 8.38 Å are obtained, which is the C2/c space group of BaB2O4 (ICDD-PDF-00-024-0086). In this study, the boron-based precipitate
is calcined at 1050 °C and a glasslike material is obtained,
which indicates the formation of α-BaB2O4 structure.

Crystallization Mechanism
To further
elucidate the
mechanism of crystallization, the change in the morphology of boron-containing
precipitates by silica sand and MAS materials was further examined
by cross-sectional SEM. As illustrated in Figure 6, the needle-shaped precipitates of perborate
start to accumulate onto the active sites of the MAS surface at 8
h (Figure 6a) and then
almost cover the surface of MAS at 72 h (Figure 6b). Once the formation of perborate precipitates
reaches the saturation of active sites onto the MAS surface, the crystals
start to build up the peroxo-bridge and continue to grow to generate
a multilayered structure at 96 h (Figure 6c). Finally, the MAS surface exhibits a layer-by-layer
assembly to form a core–shell structure at 216 h (Figure 6d). Moreover, the
monoclinic crystal length of barium peroxoborate is in the range of
10–20 μm (inset of Figure 6d). It is also noted that the SEM–EDS spectrum
only shows peaks of Ba, B, and O elements onto MAS after 216 h (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which depicts
the formation of α-BaB2O4 onto the MAS
surface.

Figure 6 Cross-sectional SEM images of (a–d) MAS and (e–h)
silica sand during boron recovery at various reaction times.

Figure 6e–h
shows the evolution of crystallization of the silica sand at various
reaction times. Different from the MAS system, small amount of precipitate
is produced onto the silica sand surface up to 72 h. The precipitation
of spherically colloidal particles onto the silica sand surface is
observed at 96 h and then accumulates on the surface after 216 h of
reaction. The difference in the formation mechanisms of boron precipitates
between silica sand and MAS is mainly attributed to the surface functionality
and specific surface area. MAS contains functional groups including
Si–OH– active sites and negatively charged
ions of T–O–···Na+ on the surface.29,34 The large surface area of MAS
can thus provide abundant ion exchange sites and negative charges
to capture Ba2+ from the aqueous solution, which can, in
turn, produce a highly crystalline barium peroxoborate (BaB2(OO)2(OH)4) through a dimeric peroxoborate
anion (B2(OO)2(OH)4)2–.

According to these results, the possible mechanism of the
crystallization
and recovery of boron in the presence of silica sand and MAS materials
is proposed. As illustrated in Scheme 2, the crystallization of peroxoborate species in the
presence of silica sand occurs from the homogeneous nucleation to
produce flowerlike spherical crystals with a diameter of around 2
μm. The attachment of colloidal particles onto silica sand would
then result in collision between nuclei and silica sands, resulting
in heterogeneous nucleation and granulation. A wide variety of FBC
reactions using silica sand as carriers for the removal of metal and
nonmetal ions in aqueous solution also show similar reaction mechanism.41 Since silica sand lacks high surface area to
enhance nucleation, long crystallization time is needed and a large
amount of sludge would be produced during coagulation/flocculation
processes. In contrast, the Ba2+-adsorbed MAS triggers
the formation of barium peroxoborate more readily, followed by the
nucleation and crystallization to produce a needle-like crystalloid.
The needle-like crystalloid grows directly on the rough surface along
with open pores of MAS. Once the active sites reach saturation, the
crystalline precipitates start to grow layer-by-layer by the formation
of oxo-bridge and subsequently result in the formation of a core–shell
structure.

Conclusions
In
this study, a functionalized mesoporous MAS nanomaterial previously
developed from the TFT-LCD panel waste glass serves as a sustainable
carrier for the adsorption of barium ions as well as the recovery
of boron. The nonporous waste glass is transformed into mesoporous
aluminosilicate nanomaterials via the cleavage of passive Si–O–BO
bonds into the reactive Si–O linkages and negatively charged
ions of T–O–···Na+ on the surface. A high surface area of 226 m2/g is also
obtained for MAS after activation. MAS exhibits an excellent capacity
for barium adsorption, and the maximum adsorption of 105 mg/g is observed,
which enhances the recovery efficiency and crystallization ratio of
boron by 95 and 93.4%, respectively. Moreover, the possible mechanisms
for the crystallization of boron-containing precipitates are elucidated.
The surface functionality and large surface area of MAS trigger the
crystallization of precipitates more readily and produce a layer-by-layer
core–shell-type crystals rapidly. HT-XRD confirms that the
crystallinity of the end-product of MAS crystallization is a hexagonal-phase
BaB2O4, which is then converted to α-BaB2O4 at 1050 °C. Results obtained in this study
clearly demonstrate a novel environmentally benign strategy for the
fabrication of functionalized mesoporous aluminosilicate as the COP-FBC
carrier, which can open a gateway to recover boron species from water
and wastewater after the calcination of boron-containing precipitates.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, >99.5%), NaOH, BaCl2, HBO3, and H2O2 were purchased from Merck Co. Hydrochloric acid
(HCl,
EL grade) and nitric acid (HNO3, EL grade) were obtained
from BASF Co. All the other chemicals used in this study were of analytical
grade and used as received without further purification. The waste
TFT-LCD panel, an aluminoborosilicate glass,42 was from a local TFT-LCD company (Hsinchu, Taiwan). All solutions
were prepared using distilled deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) unless
otherwise mentioned.

Preparation of MAS
The MAS adsorbent
was prepared from
the waste TFT-LCD panel according to our previous study with minor
modification.29 Briefly, TFT-LCD was ball-milled
for 1 h and then blended with Na2CO3 for 10
min at a ratio of 1:3 to fabricate the functionalized mesoporous materials.
It is noteworthy that the melting point of aluminoborosilicate is
up to 1500 °C, which can be reduced to 1000 °C with the
addition of Na2CO3. Therefore, the resultant
mixture was melted at 1000 °C for 10 min in a furnace. After
cooling to room temperature, the resultant material was acid-washed
with 1.0 N HCl repeatedly until the solution pH was around 7. Finally,
the obtained mesoporous aluminosilicate nanomaterial, denoted as MAS,
was calcined in the furnace at 600 °C for 6 h and then stored
in a desiccator for further use.

Characterization of Silica
Sand and MAS
The pore texture
and surface area of silica sand, the commercial carrier commonly used
in the COP-FBC process, and MAS were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm using a micromeritics system
model ASAP 2420 surface area analyzer over a relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.01–0.99
at 77 K. The material was degassed at 150 °C for 6 h in a vacuum
to remove moisture prior to analysis. The specific surface area (SBET) was determined over the P/P0 range of 0.05–0.2 using the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The total pore
volume (Vt) was calculated at a relative
pressure of 0.989. Moreover, the pore size distribution was analyzed
by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model.

The surface
morphology as well as the cross-sectional image of aluminosilicate
materials was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(Zeiss LEO 1530 FE-SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) (Bruker, XFlash Dector 5010) at 20 kV and field emission transmission
electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F/OXFORD X-Max 80T) at 200
kV. The cross section of aluminosilicate materials was prepared using
a rotary microtome (Leica Ultracut, Germany). Moreover, the histogram
of MAS was determined by counting the particle size from the FE-TEM
image. The crystallinity was identified by using a Bruker D8 advanced
X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ =
1.5405 Å) at the voltage and current density of 40 kV and 40
mA, respectively. The change in chemical species of element in MAS
nanomaterials was analyzed by a ESCA PHI 1600 X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (XPS, Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN) using an
Al Kα X-ray source at 1486.6 eV. The crystalline structure of
boron-containing precipitate was determined by high-temperature X-ray
diffraction (HT-XRD) (Multiflex, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with a Cu Kγ
radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The XRD patterns of the precipitate
were recoded from 100 to 700 °C in air on a Pt stage. The Raman
spectra of crystal functional were recorded by a Bruker Senterra micro-Raman
spectrometer equipped with an Olympus BX 51 microscope and a DU420-OE
CCD camera. The functional groups of aluminosilicate-based nanomaterials
were determined with a Horiba FT720 Fourier transformation infrared
(FTIR) spectrophotometer to confirm the functional groups of the as-prepared
MAS nanomaterials.

Adsorption of Barium Ions by MAS
The adsorption of
barium ions by the as-prepared MAS was performed in batch experiments.
After the addition of 1 g/L the as-prepared MAS into 100 mL of solutions
containing 10–300 mg/L barium ions at pH 5, the suspensions
were incubated isothermally at 25 °C on a reciprocating thermostat
water bath shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h in the dark. Appropriate amount
(1 mL) of solution was sampled at the specific intervals and the solution
was filtrated by 0.45 μm filters to separate liquids and solids.
The initial and final concentrations of barium ions in solutions were
measured by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometer
(ICP-OES, iCAP-7400, Thermo Fisher).

COP-FBC Experiments
The recovery of boron by the as-synthesized
MAS and the commercial silica sand were studied in COP-FBC experiments.
As shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information),
50 g/L of the as-synthesized MAS and silica sand was added into each
COP-FBC column. Three different synthetic solutions containing boron,
barium, and H2O2 at flow rates of 15, 15, and
0.7 mL/min, respectively, were transferred into the mixture separately
to yield the [H2O2]/[B] and [Ba]/[B] ratios
of 2 and 1, respectively, at pH 10.5.14 To monitor the change in boron concentration in the COP-FBC reactor,
100 mL of effluent was sampled at regular intervals and then filtrated
by 0.45 μm filters to separate liquids and solids. The boron
concentration in effluent solutions was determined by ICP-OES. In
addition, the efficiency of COP-FBC was evaluated by recovery efficiency
(RE, %) and crystallization ratio (CR, %) of boron using eqs 1 and 2.15,43,44 1   2  where [B]s and
[B]t are the boron concentrations in the
effluent and carrier, respectively; Qt and QB are the total flow rate and boron
flow rate, respectively; CB0 is the initial
boron concentration; and AWB is the total amount of boron
washed from TFT-LCD during activation process.
