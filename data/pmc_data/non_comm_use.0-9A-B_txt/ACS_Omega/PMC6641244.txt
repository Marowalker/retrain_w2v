In this work, dihydro-5-hydroxyl
furan-2-one (2H-HBO), a renewable-sourced
chemical containing the hydroxyl functionality, is converted into
its acrylic counterpart for the first time through a green chemical
procedure using methacrylic anhydride. This newly synthesized acrylic
monomer is able to be polymerized using different techniques such
as bulk, solution, and emulsion polymerization. The ability of this
monomer to copolymerize with other commercially available acrylates
is studied using emulsion polymerization techniques. The pendent lactone
ring remains unopened during polymerization and the new monomer is
able to copolymerize with other acrylates such as methyl methacrylate
and styrene. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer reaction
emulsion polymerization is also studied with the same monomer, leading
to a steady conversion (∼60%) with a low polydispersity of
1.06. The homopolymer produced from such an emulsion polymerization
shows a higher molecular weight than that produced from other methods,
with a glass transition temperature of around 105 °C. This demonstrates
the potential of this monomer as an interesting, green replacement
for methyl methacrylate in certain fields of application.

Introduction
The synthesis and utilization
of functional chemicals from renewable
resources is an active area of research in industry and academia,
with different biomass sources (both land and aquatic) being treated
and converted into platform chemicals from which different final products
like biosolvents and fuels and polymeric products can be manufactured.1−3

Most of the current, commercially available thermoplastics
and
thermosets are produced from petrochemical feedstocks, but gradual
depletion of petrochemical oils and increasing concern about the environment
has created new challenges to replace these fossil feedstocks with
renewable ones.4,5 To date, several renewable platform-based
chemicals have been developed and some are already commercialized.6 Polymers from renewable polylactic acid,7 polyhydroxyalkanoates,8 sugar-based polymers,9 and polymer from
natural oils10 are some examples of these.
Because the cost of the polymers is generally high, more and more
research has been focused on creating more renewable feedstocks that
are not only readily accessible but can also be converted into different
functional platform chemicals for further production of different
polymers.11 Lignocellulosic biomass12 (including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)
is one of the most abundant natural feedstocks from which different
natural precursors can be synthesized. Glucose is obtained from the
degradation of cellulose, whereas hemicellulose degradation results
in the formation of C5 and C6 sugars, which
include xylose and arabinose, and mannose, galactose and rhamnose,
respectively.13 These five- and six-membered
sugars give rise to several building block chemicals like 1,4-diacids
(malic, fumaric, and succinic acid), 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid,
3-hydroxypropanoic acid, itaconic acid, levulinic acid, aspartic acid,
glutamic acid, glucaric acid, 3-hydroxybutyrolactone, glycerol, sorbitol,
and xylitol/arabinitol. Such building blocks can be converted into
fine or intermediate chemicals by catalytic or chemical modifications.14

Levoglucosenone (1,6-anhydro-3,4-dideoxy-β-d-pyranosen-2-one,
LGO), a sugar enone with readily modifiable functional groups and
a double-bond ring structure, can be obtained from the catalytic fast
pyrolysis of cellulose.15 Due to its unique
structure, LGO is an interesting platform material from which several
other important chemicals can be produced. The glycosidic anhydro-linkage,
the keto-group, and carbon–carbon double bound all create three
different functional positions to produce several interesting chemicals.
LGO can undergo acid–base-catalyzed reactions, bromination
reactions, Michael addition, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions,
Diels–Alder reaction, reactions involving keto-group, and so
on.16 Dihydro-5-hydroxyl furan-2-one (2H-HBO)
is a LGO-derived compound recently reported to be produced through
the lipase-mediated Baeyer–Villiger oxidation through a sustainable
way.17 2H-HBO is an important chemical
as it can be modified into different chemicals for the production
of sustainable polymers. 2H-HBO from nonrenewable resource has been
polymerized and reported; however, detailed chemical studies of this
monomer and polymer, including copolymer syntheses and living polymerization,
have not yet been reported.18

The
aim of this research is to use renewable chemicals to produced
renewable structural monomeric units for polymers applied to a wide
range of applications.19,20 In this work, we report the synthesis
of an acrylics monomer from 2H-HBO (obtained from renewable resources),
which produces a polymer that appears to be a promising replacement
for poly(methyl methacylate) (PMMA)21 in
different areas of application. In this paper, the synthesis, characterization,
successful polymerization, and copolymerization of this monomer using
different synthetic techniques such as bulk, solution, and emulsion
polymerization are discussed. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain
transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a method of producing polymers with
defined and controlled molecular characteristics such as molecular
weight and microstructure.22 Nevertheless,
very few reports have been found to study the RAFT polymerization
with any bioderived acrylic monomers.23,24 In this research,
we also report the RAFT emulsion polymerization of our new bioderived
monomer, leading to a polymer with a well-controlled polydispersity
and a high molecular weight.

Results and Discussion
The main
aim of this research work is to synthesize a methacrylic
derivative of 2H-HBO in a facile way with easy workup suitable for
future scale up and subsequent polymerization of the monomer and investigation
of the nature of the polymer in different polymerization techniques,
by both controlled and normal free radical polymerization reactions.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the synthesis of bioacrylics
based on 2H-HBO and its subsequent production of homo- and copolymers
(without disrupting the lactone ring) through free radical and controlled
free radical polymerizations, and further characterizations of these
polymers, have not yet been reported.

Methacrylated 2H-HBO (m-2H-HBO)
Monomer Synthesis
Methacrylic
derivatives are mostly synthesized through the reaction of methacryloyl
chloride, where the reaction should be carefully handled because of
its chemical reactivity, and silica gel column chromatography is needed
to purify the product, which requires a large amount of solvent and,
thus, is not green in terms of scale up. Dichloromethane is generally
used as the solvent, which is itself not a green solvent. In this
report, we synthesize methacrylic derivatives using methacrylic anhydride
(MAN) along with triethylamine (TEA) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)
(as a catalyst) in ethyl acetate as a solvent (Scheme 1). Avoiding a long workup with different
basic and acidic solutions, simple NaHCO3 and water washing
results in pure monomer with a yield of 79%, without using any column
chromatography. The final structure of the monomer synthesized was
confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, and mass spectrometry
results. A byproduct methacrylic acid from this reaction can be recovered
and reused.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Methacrylated 2H-HBO (m-2H-HBO)
The successful incorporation
of methacrylic group is confirmed
from the appearance of vinylic protons at 6.2 and 5.6 ppm (Ha and Hb) and downfield shift of Hf proton (from
∼4.62 to ∼4.75 ppm) and Hd and He proton (from ∼3.8 and ∼3.65 to ∼4.31 and ∼4.18
ppm, respectively) (Figure 1). The disappearance of the OH band and appearance of one
extra carbonyl peak and C=C peak in the IR spectrum confirms
the monomer structure (for detailed 13C NMR and IR, see
the Supporting Information).

Figure 1 1H NMR spectrum of 2H-HBO and m-2H-HBO.

Homopolymerization of m-2H-HBO
The ability of this
monomer to polymerize by free radical polymerization without its ring
being opened (Scheme 2) is confirmed by 1H NMR. Compared to 1H NMR
of m-2H-HBO, 1H NMR of the polymer shows the absence of
vinyl proton (6.0–5.5 ppm) (Figure 2). The appearance of −CH2– peaks (Hc protons) around 1 ppm chain and broadening
of Hf and Hd and He peak confirms
the formation of backbone chain, as well as the retention of the structure
without being opened. The disappearance of the C=C bond signal
at 1637 cm–1 (IR, supporting documents) indicates
the formation of a polymer is also confirmed by IR (Supporting Information) from the disappearance of the C=C
bond signal at 1637 cm−1. The formed polymer was
found to have an average molecular weight, Mn of 9500.

of m-2H-HBO and m-2H-HBO homopolymer.

Scheme 2 Homopolymerization of Methacrylated 2H-HBO (m-2H-HBO)
The polymer has a thermal stability
up to ∼200 °C (without
significant degradation) and 20% of the material degrades around 300
°C, indicating a good thermal stability (Figure 3a). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the homopolymer is found to be around
95.4 °C (from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement)
(Figure 3b), which
is very similar to PMMA, and hence could act as a potential replacement
of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in some cases.

analysis (TGA) analysis of bulk homopolymer
and (b) DSC analysis of homopolymer from bulk (above) and emulsion
(below).

Solution Polymerizations
With considerations of commercial
applicability and environmental effects, solution polymerizations
are carried out in different solvents ranging from low polarity (like
toluene or xylene) to highly polar solvents (such as dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)) including mid-polar-ranged solvents (ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and ethylene glycol). Toluene, xylene, and n-butanol are industrially useful solvents for solution
polymerizations, whereas ethyl acetate, ethylene glycol, and DMSO
are considered greener solvents. Due to the presence of polar lactone
groups, the polymer is sufficiently polar to allow precipitation during
the polymerization in toluene and xylene (termed as “precipitation
polymerization”).25

The polymer
remains soluble during polymerization in the mid-polar range solvents
like ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and ethylene glycol
at the polymerization temperature, but starts to precipitate out from
the solution once it is cooled to room temperature. DMSO is found
to be the best among the solvents in terms of overall solubility,
as well as the molecular weights that could be achieved in this solvent.
This is likely because DMSO has a lower chain transfer constant compared
to other polar solvents, leading to a higher molecular weight because
of the diffusion-controlled nature of the termination step, which
is absent in the other three polar solvent used.26 The polymer remains soluble in this solvent during polymerization,
as well as at room temperature. The molecular weights, molecular weight
distribution, and percent yield of this homopolymer (both bulk and
solution based) are listed in Table 1.

Emulsion Polymerizations
Given the
desirable prospect
of polymerization of such materials in water, emulsion polymerization
of this newly synthesized monomer is undertaken along with other commercially
available monomers (Scheme 3). Simple emulsion formulations are used with 30% solid content,
with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (5
wt %) both used as a surfactant and costabilizer. Compared to bulk
and solution polymerization, homopolymerization of this monomer in
an emulsion yields materials of higher molecular weight, yield, and Tg. This could be due to the combined effect
of bulk and solution polymerization, where water acts as a better
heat dispersant compared to other organic solvents, with each micelle
acting as a miniature bulk reactor. The yield of emulsion polymerization
is found to be 82% (compared to bulk and solution polymerization),
with a Tg around 108 °C (∼95
°C in bulk). The higher glass transition temperature of emulsion
polymer is likely due to higher molecular weight (25 000) and
narrow polydispersity (1.85) compared to the bulk polymerization (molecular
weight: 19 500, Đ: 4.20). A polymer
with a broad molecular weight distribution may contain polymers of
short chain length, which can act as a plasticizer and thus reduce
the glass transition. The particle size of the emulsion polymer is
found to be around 500 nm (see Figure S6a, Supporting Information). To determine its capability to polymerize
with other monomers, copolymerization with different commercially
available monomers in water is studied. Detailed results of these
copolymers along with the homopolymer are shown in Table 3.

Scheme 3 Copolymerization
of Methacrylated 2H-HBO (m-2H-HBO)
Table 2 results
show that this monomer copolymerizes
well with polar monomers such as methyl methacrylate (MMA) and hydroxy
ethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and in terms of yield, the molecular weight
that could be obtained. In addition, it produces comparable composition
ratios and Tg. This monomer copolymerised
well with polar monomers such as HEMA. The copolymer composition ratios
decreased with a reduction in the comonomer polarity and gave a low
copolymer composition ratio with styrene. This may be due to the significant
difference in polarities between m-2H-HBO and styrene and the steric
hindrance between the large pendent groups that both monomers possess.
A significant difference in polarity and steric hindrance between
these two monomers is expected to create a difference in reactivity,
which makes one monomer (styrene in this case) react more readily
compared to other monomers, leading to copolymers with low molecular
weight and compositions rich in styrene.

Kinetics Studies of Emulsion Copolymerizations
To understand
the reactivity of this monomer, emulsion copolymerization studies
with MMA are undertaken and the reactivity ratio of m-2H-HBO (r1) and MMA (r2)
determined experimentally by measuring the copolymer compositions
by 1H NMR spectroscopy at low conversion (<10 wt %).
Fineman–Ross (F–R)27 and
Kelen–Tüdös (K–T)28 (Supporting Information eqs 1 and 2, Figures S4–S6) methods are applied to
calculate the reactivity ratios shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Comparison of Reactivity Ratios by
F–R and K–T Methods

average	3.84 ± 0.042	0.22 ± 0.028	0.84	0.26	4.55	
In this system, m-2H-HBO is more
reactive (r1 = 3.84 ± 0.042) than
MMA (r2 = 0.22 ± 0.028). The reactivity
ratios obtained from the two
different methods appear to be consistent with each other. The higher
reactivity of m-2H-HBO compared to MMA is believed to be due to the
effect high polarity of the ester alkyl substituents in m-2H-HBO.
The 2H-HBO group imparts significant polarity in the structure and
makes the methacrylate more reactive than MMA.29

RAFT Emulsion Polymerizations
RAFT
emulsion polymerization
is also studied. In this aspect of the work, the selection of the
chain transfer agent (CTA) becomes important, as the reagent should
be sufficiently polar to be miscible with the monomer, and should
be sparingly soluble in water. 4-Cyano-4-(((dodecylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)pentanoic
acid (BM1432) satisfies this criterion and is chosen as a CTA for
polymerization. The ratio of monomer to CTA was 100:1, targeting a
molecular weight of 13 000 for full monomer conversion. The
surfactant and co-stabilizer are kept identical to the previous simple
emulsion polymerization to determine the efficiency of both of these
ingredients in the system. Initial phase separation is observed at
the start of the reaction, which recovered over time to form a stable
emulsion after 30 min (ensuring a completely stable emulsion). Table 4 summarizes the result
of polymerizations.

The theoretical
number average molecular weight (Mn) can
be calculated from the % conversion obtained from
gravimetric analysis and using the following equation  where Mn = number
average molecular weight of the polymer, [M0] = concentration
of monomer taken, Mm = molecular weight
of the monomer, [CTA0] = concentration of RAFT agent, φ
= percent conversion, and [MCTA] = molecular weight of
the RAFT agent.

Figure 4 shows the
growth of the molecular weight of the polymer and the polydispersity
of the polymer as a function of conversion. It can be seen that the
theoretical molecular weight agrees well with the experimental molecular
weight. The polydispersity at the start of the reaction is a high
value of 1.3, and slowly decreases as the reaction precedes, indicating
a better control of polymerization. A slow rate of increase in the
molecular weight of the polymer is observed during this span of time,
also indicative of a better controlled polymerization. As the reaction
proceeds with time, the reaction becomes controlled by the transfer
agent, and the rate of increase in molecular weight decreases. The
polydispersity is found to decrease, also indicative of improved control
of the reaction by the CTA. Within 6 h, 60% monomer is found to be
converted to polymer, with a final molecular weight around Mn of 8770 and a low polydispersity of 1.06 (see Figure S5, Supporting Information). The particle
of the final emulsion polymer is found to be around 100 nm (see Figure S6b, Supporting Information). To support
the living character of the RAFT-derived polymer, a chain extension
reaction with MMA is studied keeping the monomer/CTA/initiator same
in DMSO at 70 °C for 6 h. With a conversion of 48%, the final
molecular weight of the polymer is found to be Mn,GPC = 13 000 (Mn,theo:
14 200; Mw,GPC: 19 600, Đ: 1511), which supports the living character of the
RAFT emulsion homopolymer (Figure S5, Supporting
Information).

Conclusions
A bio-based methacrylic
monomer has been successfully synthesized
using a simple sustainable method (simple reaction conditions and
postreaction workup process), with high yield and purity from natural
cellulosic waste. The successful free radical method demonstrates
its capability to be polymerized without the need to react (open)
the lactone ring. This pendent lactone ring makes the polymer polar
and bulky, requiring a sufficiently highly polar solvent such as DMSO
for synthesis so that the material remains soluble. Emulsion polymerization
in water appears more promising than solution polymerization, in terms
of yield, molecular weight, and Tg of
the polymer. The copolymerizing ability of this monomer worked well
with polar monomers such as HEMA, with the ability to
polymerize decreasing with a reduction in the comonomer polarity.
RAFT emulsion polymerization yielded a polymer with a PDI of 1.06
under identical condition and recipe of emulsion polymerization, leading
to a stable latex. The high glass transition temperature of this monomer
showed the potential of this monomer to be a possible replacement
for methyl methacrylate and styrene in different area of applications.

Instruments and Methods
A Bruker DRX spectrometer (400
MHz, Me4Si as internal standard) was used to analyze 1H NMR and 13C NMR in chloroform-d1 and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) at room temperature. IR and
mass spectrometry was performed using Agilent Cary 630 FTIR and Agilent
6120 Quadrupole LC/MS spectrometers, respectively. TGA was performed
using Mettler TGA/DSC1 STAR with a heating rate to 10 °C/min
from 20 to 500 °C under nitrogen atmosphere in a standard aluminum
pan (sample weight: 1–10 mg). A PerkinElmer DSC8000 was used
for the DSC measurement with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in aluminum
pans (sample weight: 10–20 mg). The samples were scanned from
0 to 140 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Each sample
was healed through three heating cycles to remove thermal history,
and the glass transition temperature (Tg) values were obtained from third heating cycle. The molecular weights
of different polymer samples were measured by GPC on Tosoh EcosHLC-8320
equipped with UV detector (λ = 280 nm) and refractive index
detector with Tosoh alpha 2000 and 4000 columns. DMF with LiBr (10
mM) was used as eluent with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The columns were
calibrated with a series of polystyrene standards. JEOL-JEM 2100F
FEGTEM was used at 200 kV to measure the particle size of the emulsions.

Synthesis
Synthesis of Methacrylated 2H-HBO (m-2H-HBO) Monomer
0.10 g (0.90 mM) of DMAP and 13.1 g (129 mM) of TEA were charged
into a two-necked round-bottom flask. 10.0 g (86.1 mM) of 2H-HBO was
added followed by subsequent addition of 25 mL ethyl acetate. The
flask was sealed and the whole mixture stirred under nitrogen for
45 min to ensure the formation of a homogeneous mixture. 13.9 g (90.4
mM) of MAN was mixed with 10 mL ethyl acetate and added to the mixture
dropwise (about 1 drop/s). After the complete addition of MAN, the
solution was allowed to stir under nitrogen for 4 h followed by heating
at 55 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the solution was further
diluted by the addition of 200 mL ethyl acetate. The solution was
filtered to remove TEA–salt and the organic layer was washed
with saturated NaHCO3 solution and water, respectively.
The organic layer was collected and the solvent was evaporated to
collect pure methacrylated 2H-HBO (m-2H-HBO). Yield: 7.9 g, 79%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ/ppm 1.87 (t, 3H),

Synthesis of a Homopolymer,
Poly(m-2H-HBO), by Bulk Polymerization
The synthesized methacrylated
2H-HBO was polymerized by a free
radical bulk polymerization using AIBN as an initiator. 1.00 g (5.43
mM) of m-2H-HBO was placed in a predried round-bottom flask and 0.01
g (0.06 mM) initiator was added. The system was sealed and stirred
under nitrogen for a half an hour to ensure full miscibility of the
initiator with the monomer in a completely inert atmosphere. The system
was then heated at 65 °C for 6 h. After the polymerization, the
hard solid obtained was crushed into fine powder, which was washed
with methanol, redissolved in DMF, and reprecipitated with methanol
and dried in an oven until constant weight. This dried polymer was
then weighed to calculate the yield and used for further characterizations. 1H HMR (400 MHz, DMSO): 0.80–0.96 (d, 3H), 1.80–1.95

Synthesis of a Homopolymer,
Poly(m-2H-HBO), by Solution Polymerization
Solution polymerization
was carried out in different solvents ranging
from toluene to dimethyl sulfoxide considering a range of low to high
polarity with AIBN as an initiator (1 wt % wrt monomer wt). Solid
content of 30% was kept constant in each reaction. 1 g (5.43 mM) of
m-2H-HBO, 0.01 g (0.06 mM) of AIBN, and solvent were added in a round-bottom
flask. The flask was sealed, stirred to make a homogeneous solution,
and flashed with nitrogen for 30 min. The system was heated at 65
°C for 6 h. After polymerization, the polymer was precipitated
out in chilled methanol, washed for 30 min, filtered, and dried in
the oven till a constant weight was obtained.

Synthesis
of a Homopolymer, Poly(m-2H-HBO), by Emulsion Polymerization
Technique
Emulsion polymerization was performed using the
following recipe (Table 5).
SDS and PVA were added to 4 mL of water in a two-neck round-bottom
flask. The mixture was vigorously stirred and heated to 65 °C
to dissolve the emulsifier, and purged for 15 min with nitrogen to
remove any oxygen. The system was sealed and the temperature increased
to 80 °C, followed by the addition of initiator in 1 mL of water.
Immediate slow addition of monomer was followed and the reaction was
continued for 6 h. After the reaction, the white milky emulsion was
centrifuged and washed with methanol, ethanol, and water, respectively,
to remove the emulsifier. The solid polymer obtained was dried in
an oven until constant weight.

Synthesis of Copolymers
by Emulsion Polymerization
Copolymerization reactions were
carried with commercially available
monomers (Table 5).
The feed ratio (1:1) and solid content (30 wt %) were kept constant
for each reaction. The same recipe and reaction conditions were maintained
for each reaction, followed by same reaction workup.

Synthesis
of Copolymers with MMA by Emulsion Polymerization
To study
the reactivity ratio, copolymerizations by emulsion polymerization
were studied. Copolymers of different molar ratios of m-2H-HBO (M1)
and MMA (M2) from 9:1 to 1:9 were synthesized under the same reaction
conditions as previous emulsion polymerizations. To estimate the reactivity
ratios, all of the copolymerizations were terminated at low conversions
(<10 wt %) by quenching with ethanolic hydroquinone solution. Each
reaction mixture was divided into two parts, one part was used to
measure the conversion by gravimetric analysis and the other part
was precipitated in chilled methanol, followed by washing with acetone
and reprecipitation in methanol to obtain a pure copolymer for 1H NMR studies.

Synthesis of a Homopolymer, Poly(m-2H-HBO),
by RAFT Emulsion
Polymerization
The RAFT emulsion polymerization was carried
out under conditions identical to those used for the standard emulsion
polymerization described above (Table 5). The monomer/CTA/initiator ratio was 100:1:0.1. The
CTA was mixed with the monomer and charged together. In different
time intervals, the samples were withdrawn under nitrogen flow. The
samples were cooled in an ice bath and quenched by 10% hydroquinone
solution in ethanol. One part was taken for molecular weight measurement
and another part was analyzed by gravimetric analysis for conversion
calculation.
