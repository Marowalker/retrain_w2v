Targeted delivery of antigens to
antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
by utilizing natural anticarbohydrate antibodies is a promising approach
for selective uptake and enhanced antigen presentation. Previously,
we reported that in the presence of a natural antibody, anti-rhamnose
antibody (anti-Rha), the bacterial sugar rhamnose conjugated with
liposomal cancer antigen MUC1-Tn enhances antigen presentation by
APCs such as dendritic cells by targeting Fc gamma receptors. The
idea was to utilize the natural human anti-Rha antibodies present
in human serum for targeted delivery of cancer-specific antigens.
Recently, we found that the IgG3 antibody isotype was the most prevalent
anti-Rha antibody generated in mice immunized with rhamnose-Ficoll
(Rha-Ficoll) antigen. In this manuscript, we have conjugated the murine
IgG3-Fc with a MUC1-containing cancer vaccine and compared the humoral
and cellular immune response to this vaccine with one targeted via
the human anti-Rha antibody and to the MUC1 vaccine alone. This Fc
approach enhanced antibody production and T-cell proliferation almost
to the same level as using the anti-Rha antibody. These results suggest
that targeting Fc directly to dendritic cells can be an alternative
approach to human anti-Rha for generating effective antigen-primed
T-cells.

==== Body
Introduction
The target of vaccination,
whether preventative or therapeutic,
is to prevent the spread of disease. Preventative vaccines are designed
mainly to produce specific antibodies and memory B cells, whereas
therapeutic vaccines are prepared to stimulate the immune system to
additionally produce antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). A
successful therapeutic vaccine induces both humoral and cellular immunity
and effectively prevents the spread of a disease. Dendritic cells
(DCs) participate between innate and adaptive immunity by capturing
antigen and presenting it to T-cells after processing.1,2 This is very important to generate effective antigen-specific immunity.
After capturing antigen and receiving an activation signal, DCs migrate
to secondary lymphoid organs from the peripheral tissue and present
peptide from the processed antigen to T-cells through major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules.3 Depending on
the absence or presence of inflammatory signals, DCs can be tolerogenic
or immunogenic.4 DCs possess receptors
for inflammatory signals or microbial products and can become mature
cells, which are essential for adaptive immunity.5,6

Different receptors on DCs have been identified for effective capture
and presentation of antigens.7−9 Fc receptors (FcRs) are very common
for antibody-mediated antigen uptake.10,11 Utilizing
a natural anticarbohydrate antibody to enhance the antigen presentation
of a vaccine by forming a complex between the antibody and corresponding
vaccine antigen has been found effective. α-gal antibodies are
among the most common natural anticarbohydrate antibodies present
in human serum. They have been targeted to form complexes with the
α-gal epitope in vivo and were found to augment immunogenicity
by the interaction between FcRs of DCs and the Fc portion of the antigal
antibody.12,13 Similarly, anti-Rha is another anticarbohydrate
antibody found in human serum in large amounts.14 Targeting the anti-Rha antibody for effective uptake and
presentation of a cancer vaccine conjugated with rhamnose has been
found to be very promising in terms of the production of both antibody
and cancer-killing CTLs (CD8 T-cells).15−17 However, the success
of this approach entirely depends on the presence of specific natural
antibodies in human serum which limits its usability.

Direct
conjugation of the Fc portion of an antibody isotype with
a liposomal cancer vaccine is another approach that does not depend
on the presence of natural antibodies. This helps in targeting the
cancer vaccine directly to DCs through FcRs without the need of anti-Rha
antibodies.

In this article, we have compared both approaches
and showed that
the Fc approach can be equally effective as a natural antibody-targeting
(human anti-Rha antibody) approach in generating both cancer antigen-specific
antibody production and inducing cellular immunity.

As a liposomal
cancer vaccine, we used one of the most common tumor-associated
antigens, mucin 1 (MUC1).18,19 It is a glycoprotein
usually overexpressed on the apical surface of tumor cells.20−22 In normal cells, it is highly glycosylated with elongated O-glycans that shield the protein backbone from the immune
system. However, on cancer cells, MUC1 is usually hypoglycosylated
with fewer truncated O-glycans. Some tumor-associated
carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are found on MUC1, notably Tn, TF, and
STn.23 However, because they are not highly
immunogenic, TACAs have been conjugated with different carrier proteins
by different research groups.24,25 The problem with carrier
proteins, however, is that they are immunogenic and might produce
immune responses, which can impede the desired immune response. In
our vaccine design, we used a TLR-2 agonist (Pam3-Cys-SK4) covalently linked to a MUC1-Tn peptide, which helps in DC
maturation and antigen presentation to T-cells.

Results and Discussion
Targeting whole IgG Fc domains to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR)
of DCs for antigen loading can be critical considering FcγR
can be both activating and inhibitory.26,27 Under normal
conditions, this targeting seemed insufficient for DC maturation because
of the presence of inhibitory FcγRIIb. Earlier studies revealed
that knocking out the FcγRIIb receptor from mice or blocking
of FcγRIIb through mAb resulted in the up-regulation of MHC
II molecules.28,29 These studies motivated us to
use the Fc domain from an IgG isotype that would specifically bind
with an activating FcγR and not to an inhibitory receptor. In
mice, IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes both bind with activating FcγR.
However, IgG1 also binds with inhibitory FcγRIIb, whereas IgG3
binds only with activating FcγRI.

We had previously found
that anti-Rha antibodies generated in mice
with Rha-Ficoll were more efficient at enhancing an immune response
than those generated with Rha-ovalbumin.17 The anti-Rha antibody generated in mice was mostly IgG3 when the
mice were immunized with Rha-Ficoll and IgG1 in response to Rha-Ova.
Because mouse IgG3 is supposed to bind only activating FcγRI,
we targeted the Fc portion of the murine IgG3 isotype (Sino-Biological
Inc.) to conjugate with liposomal Pam3-Cys-SK4-MUC1-Tn cancer vaccine.

For conjugation purposes, thiol residues
were introduced into Fc
by modification with the heterobifunctional cross-linker N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate.30 Next, deprotection was carried out by using dithiothreitol (DTT)
and later the protein was conjugated with liposome31 (Figure 1). Details of the conjugation approach are described in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Fc conjugation approach.
Reagent and conditions: (a) Fc in PBS
(pH = 7.5), 30 min, RT (b) DTT solution (15 mM solution), 30 min,
RT.

The freshly reduced thiolated
Fc solution was added to dipalmitidoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) liposomes containing 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethyleneglycol)] DSPE-PEG-MAL (1% by wt).
The mixture was stirred overnight at RT. The liposomal pellet was
centrifuged down, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
buffer, and resuspended in the desired volume of PBS buffer for injections.
Assay of the supernatant showed that approx. 90% of the thiolated
Fc was conjugated to the liposomes.

After the conjugation process,
we sought to determine whether Fc
conjugation enhanced the antigen uptake and presentation by DCs. We
compared this conjugation approach with the human anti-Rha antibody-targeting
approach. As a control group, we used cancer antigen (MUC1-Tn) liposomes
only. Three groups of liposomes were prepared for three groups of
C57BL/6 mice (five per group). Stock solutions were prepared of DPPC,
Cholesterol, DSPE-PEG-MAL, and Rha-TEG-Cholesterol. Aliquots from
stock solutions were mixed to obtain a lipid solution of 30 mM in
a total volume of 1 mL.

Group A received mouse IgG3-Fc-conjugated
cancer vaccine, whereas
group B received human anti-Rha antibody 1 h before immunization with
Rha-containing vaccine. The last group (group C) received cancer antigen
liposomes only. All mice received one priming and two boosts of liposomal
vaccines i.p. after 14 and 28 days. Liposomes were formulated by the
extrusion method with 100 nm polycarbonate membranes as previously
described.17,32

Group A: IgG3-Fc-DSPE-PEG-MAL
(1% by wt), Pam3CysSK4-MUC-1-Tn conjugate (0.2
μmol), DPPC (79%), and cholesterol
(20%) in 100 μL.

Group B: Anti-Rha antibody (10 μg/mouse,
1 h earlier) + Pam3CysSK4-MUC-1-Tn conjugate
(0.2 μmol), cholesterol-TEG-Rha
(10%), cholesterol (10%), and DPPC (80%) in 100 μL.

Group
C: Pam3CysSK4-MUC-1-Tn conjugate
(0.2 μmol), DPPC (79%), cholesterol (20%), and DSPE-PEG-MAL
(1% by wt) in 100 μL.

Mice were bled 7 days after the
second boost for measuring antibody
production. An ELISA assay was performed to determine the antigen-specific
antibody production by screening the mice sera against the antigen,
MUC1-Tn. The ELISA was conducted as described.15 The Fc-conjugated vaccine (group A) was found to have the
best antibody production in comparison with group B. As predicted,
group C had the lowest antibody production (Figure 2A). Therefore, it clearly shows that both
Fc-conjugated antibody and human anti-Rha antibody targeting were
efficient approaches compared to the control group (group C).

Figure 2 Both the Fc
targeting strategy and human anti-rhamnose antibodies
enhance antigen presentation and T-cell priming. (A) Mice were immunized
with vaccines and measured for anti-MUC1-Tn antibody production seven
days after the second boost. NI = nonimmunized. (B) Concentration-dependent
proliferative response of purified CD4+ T-cells primed in vivo with
three different groups of liposomal vaccines and assayed in vitro
with stimulation by different concentrations of MUC1-Tn and DC. (C)
Data from (B) at 40 μg mL–1 of MUC1-Tn antigen
stimulation replotted.

Next, T-cell priming was tested among those groups to determine
whether the Fc-conjugated approach helped in the production of MUC1-Tn-primed
CD4+ T-cells. The proliferation was measured with varying concentrations
(0–40 μg mL–1) of the antigen. Three
mice from each group were sacrificed 7 days after the second boost
of vaccine. Spleen cell suspensions were prepared following the protocol
described earlier.15 CD4+ T-cells were
separated using Dynabeads FlowComp mouse CD4 positive isolation kit
(Invitrogen). The rest of the cell suspension was kept for separating
CD8+ T-cells. DCs prepared from murine bone marrow were first added
to a 96 well cell culture plate (3 × 104 cells in
90 μL) followed by the MUC1-Tn antigen at different concentrations
(0, 10, 20, and 40 μg mL–1 in 60 μL
each).15 After 30 min, CD4+ T-cells were
added to their individual wells (3 × 105 cells in
50 μL) and incubated for 72 h at 37C, 5% CO2. Thus,
the ratio of DCs and CD4 was kept at 1:10. [3H]-Thymidine
was added (25 μL, 40 μCi mL–1) and incubated
for 24 h in the same condition. Cells were harvested, and filters
dried overnight. Scintillation fluid (40 μL) was added to each
well and thymidine incorporation was measured as the CPM value in
a top count scintillation counter (Packard). The best proliferation
was measured at 40 μg mL–1. At this concentration,
CD4+ T-cells from group A proliferated significantly more compared
to the other two groups (B and C) (Figure 2C).

Because high levels of IFN-γ
production are correlated with
enhanced cytotoxicity, we measured the IFN-γ production among
those three groups of mice. Purified CD8+ T-cells were obtained using
the Dynabeads Flowcomp CD8+ isolation kit (Invitrogen) and distributed
in a 12-well plate (1 × 106 in 500 μL/well).
Bone marrow-derived DCs were added (5 × 104 cells
in 500 μL) to make a ratio of 1:20. The combination was pulsed
with the 40 μg mL–1 concentration of 8 amino
acid long CD8 peptide epitope previously reported.15 The plate was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Next day, the plate was centrifuged, and supernatant was
collected immediately for measuring IFN-γ. IFN-γ cytokine
secretion was measured using a murine IFN-γ ELISA kit (Peprotech).
Group A released more IFN-γ compared to group C, which proves
that enhanced uptake and presentation leads to the secretion of more
IFN-γ (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 CD8+ T-cell-specific IFN-γ production and specific cell cytotoxicity
assay. (A) Comparison of CD8+ T-cell-specific IFN-γ production
in three groups of mice shown in Figure 2 at 40 μg mL–1 CD8
MUC1-Tn epitope peptide. (B) Apoptosis of EL4 cells presenting the
CD8 epitope peptide induced by CD8+ T-cells of the different groups.
The ratio of EL4 to CD8+ T-cells was 1:100.

To investigate the cytotoxic ability of CD8+ T-cells separated
from different groups, we used a cytotoxicity assay called a JAM assay.33 A mouse lymphoma cell line (EL4) was used as
a target cell line. One day before the experiment, EL4 cells were
grown in a fresh T25 flask. [3H]-Thymidine was added (40
μCi/mL) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following two washings, cells were brought to 105 cell/mL
and divided into two equal halves. Only one-half was pulsed with the
CD8 epitope. Both flasks were washed twice and 104 EL-4
cells in 100 μL were added to each well of a U-bottom 96-well
plate. The purified CD8+ T-cell concentration was brought to 106 cells/mL and 100 μL added to the plate at a ratio of
E/T of 1:100. Staurosporine (2 μM) was added as a positive control
instead of CD8+ T-cells in some wells. The plate was incubated for
6 h and harvested on a glass fiber filter plate using a cell harvester.
The filter plate was then dried overnight and 40 μL of scintillation
fluid was added to determine the CPM value using a Top Count scintillation
counter. Cytotoxicity induced by primed CD8+ T-cells from group A
was found to be higher compared to the control group (Figure 3B). Specific cytotoxicity was
calculated according to the following formula    Here,
spontaneous cpm denotes the cpm value
of EL4 cells alone and experimental cpm denotes the cpm value of EL4
+ CD8+ T-cells. Staurosporine cytotoxicity was considered as 100%
and % specific cytotoxicity was calculated accordingly.

Statistical Analysis
Results were calculated as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis
was performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 software. Tukey’s
multiple comparison test was performed to determine the statistical
significance among groups (both IFN-γ production and Jam assay)
(*P < 0.1, **P < 0.01) (n = 5, where, n = number of mice per group).

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that targeting a cancer vaccine
with a specific Fc isotype domain might be a promising approach in
terms of enhancing vaccine immunogenicity at both the humoral and
cellular level. The liposomal Fc-conjugated vaccine was better for
producing antigen-specific antibodies compared to the liposomal antigen
only. The vaccine also primed CD4+ T-cells that help in producing
both antibody and CD8+ effector T-cells responsible for killing tumor
cells. Overall, this approach appears to be somewhat better or as
good as targeting anti-rhamnose antibodies to DCs.
