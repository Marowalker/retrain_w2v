The
present work is emphasized on converting toxic cigarette butts
(CBs) into highly fluorescent N,S-codoped carbon dots by a facile
hydrothermal approach and exploring their multiple applications. The
as-produced carbon dots (CBCDs) exhibited bright and stable fluorescence
with a quantum yield of 26% and used as a label-free probe for “on–off–on”
sequential detection of Fe3+ and ascorbic acid (AA). The
fluorescence of CBCDs can be significantly quenched by Fe3+ ions through static quenching and restored upon the subsequent addition
of AA due to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by
AA. This nanoprobe presented great selectivity and excellent sensitivity
to Fe3+ and AA with a detection limit of 0.13 and 0.2 μM,
respectively. Furthermore, the nanoprobe was extended to biosystem
(intracellular detection) and successfully applied for the detection
of Fe3+ in real water (tap, bore, and pond) and AA in biological
samples (human urine and serum). In addition, we have constructed
an IMPLICATION logic gate based on these unique sensing characteristics.
The “visible–invisible” and “UV–visible”
property explored their use as invisible ink for security applications.
Furthermore, highly photostable fluorescent polymer films were prepared
by incorporating CBCDs in poly(vinyl alcohol). It is anticipated that
the strong and stable fluorescence emission nature of these films
might find direct or indirect applications in various optical/optoelectronic
devices, ranging from fluorescent displays to light-emitting diodes.

Introduction
One of the major goals
of United Nations Development Programme
2030 is responsible consumption and production of resources. This
can be achieved only by efficient management of available resources
and proper disposal of toxic waste and pollutants. According to a
recent report given by the World Health Organization (WHO 2017), cigarette
butts (CBs) and other tobacco wastes make up the major number of individual
pieces of litter in the world accounting to more than 40% of all items
collected during urban cleanups.1 These
butts are washed down by drains and eventually make their way to lakes,
rivers, and oceans. Ocean Conservancy also reported similar results
in this regard.2 Most of these CBs are
made up of cellulose acetate, which possess poor photo- and biodegradable
properties, making them persistent in the environment. Furthermore,
the toxic leachates of CBs pose a severe threat to aquatic life (both
marine and freshwater).3,4 According to a recent report,
CBs are potential sources of nicotine contamination in urban water
and can be a major threat to the water quality.5 Hence, effective management of these wastes is essential.
Conventional disposal methods like landfilling or incineration are
neither universally sustainable nor economically feasible for this
purpose.6

Several researchers have
made significant exertions in this concern.
Mohajerani et al. made notable contributions by incorporating CBs
in fired clay bricks6 and asphalt concrete.7 These methods offer reduction of large quantities
of CBs. However, transforming them into desired products is considered
to be a more promising way, as it can offer value-added products besides
waste management. But only a few efforts were made in this regard.
Yi et al.8 produced high-performing energy-storage
material from used cigarette filters. Wei et al.9 reported an eco-friendly approach for extracting cellulose
acetate from CBs to construct a cellulose-based membrane separator
for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Recently, Yilin et al.10 have reported the synthesis of carbon dots (CDs)
from cigarette filters and their application for fluorescence detection
of Sudan I. However, sufficient characterization data was not presented
(chemical composition of formed CDs is not studied) and the possible
formation mechanism of CDs (how the water-insoluble cellulose acetate
fibers are converted to water-soluble CDs) was not explained.

Fluorescent CDs are a new member of nanocarbon family that comprise
discrete, quasi-spherical nanoparticles with sizes below 10 nm.11 After their serendipitous discovery from carbon
nanotubes, they have gained ever-increasing attention due to their
fascinating properties like unique optical properties, multiple functional
groups, excellent biocompatibility, and chemical and photostability.12,13 They are considered as promising alternatives to fluorescent dyes
and quantum dots and are advocated for diversified applications such
as sensing,14,15 bioimaging,16−18 optoelectronic
conversion,19,20 visible-light-activated bactericide,21 fingerprint detection,22 dye degradation,23−25 solar cells,26 printing
inks,27 and gene delivery.28

Preparation methods of CDs reported so far can broadly
be grouped
into either top-down or bottom-up. The top-down approach involves
the breakdown of bulk carbon sources like graphite, carbon nanotubes,
and nanodiamonds into fluorescent CDs by employing techniques like
arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical oxidation in strong acid,
and electrochemical synthesis.11,29 Conversely, in the
bottom-up approach, the CDs are formed from molecular precursors by
applying solvothermal/hydrothermal methods,30−32 ultrasound/microwave33−35 treatments, or simple thermal combustion.36,37 Although a large variety of techniques and starting materials were
employed for the production of CDs, the demand for the sustainable
synthetic routes that adhere to the principles of green chemistry
is still high. To fulfill this requirement, researchers have explored
the use of waste materials like food waste,38 agriculture waste,39 waste paper,40 waste frying oil,41 etc. as precursors. However, the fluorescence quantum yields (QYs)
of the as-produced CDs are less than 10%, limiting the range of their
practical applications. Hence, there is a great need of developing
facile methods for the large-scale utilization of waste resources
toward the production of highly fluorescent CDs.

On the other
hand, doping CDs with nonmetals such as N, S, B, and
P received a great scientific attention as it can offer CDs with improved
properties like resistance to self-quenching, enhanced fluorescence
QY, and sensing selectivity.42 Recently,
codoping with multiple heteroatoms especially N and S has gained extensive
consideration because of the improved efficiency resulting from the
synergistic effect of the doped N and S atoms.43

In the present work, we explored the use of CBs as
source material
for the production of highly fluorescent N and S-codoped CDs. The
as-produced CDs (CBCDs) were systematically characterized by various
analytical techniques, and their stability toward diverse environmental
conditions like high ionic strength, pH, temperature, storage, and
continuous irradiation was evaluated. The CBCDs exhibited bright and
stable fluorescence with a QY of 26%. Physicochemical characterizations
revealed that the CBCDs are spherical with a mean diameter of 3.7
± 1.4 and composed of graphitic core with amorphous/polar surface
functionalities, which impart aqueous solubility. CBCDs were used
as “on–off–on” fluorescent probe for the
detection of Fe3+ and ascorbic acid (AA). The probe was
successfully applied for the analysis of real water (tap, bore, and
pond) and biological samples (human urine and serum), and a possible
quenching mechanism was proposed. In addition, we have constructed
an IMPLICATION logic gate based on these unique sensing characteristics.
Excitation-dependent emission behavior coupled with high biocompatibility
revealed the multicolor cellular imaging potential of CBCDs. Furthermore,
we have prepared fluorescent polymer films by incorporating CBCDs
into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Also these CBCDs were applied as invisible
ink for security applications.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of CBCDs
Here, we report a simple hydrothermal
method for the production of N, S codoped CDs using cigarette butts
as source material. The preparation of CDs from CBs is illustrated
in Scheme 1. Cigarette
butts are mainly composed of cellulose acetate fibers, and they also
contain minor amount of chemicals like nicotine, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), N-nitrosamine, aromatic amines,
and other tarlike components trapped during smoking.6 Conversion of cellulose acetate fibers into water-soluble
CDs is the critical step. Concentrated sulfuric acid is selected to
achieve this conversion due to (1) its strong acid hydrolyzing property,
which produces cellulose from cellulose acetate and further facilitates
the conversion of cellulose into hydrophilic cellulose nanoparticles;44 (2) its strong dehydrating property, which assists
the creation of unsaturated C=C bonds from saturated C–C
bonds; and (3) its strong oxidizing property, which facilitates the
generation of hydrophilic C–O–H and O=C–O–H
from hydrophobic C–H.41 As CDs predominantly
comprise PAHs in their carbon matrix,45 the presence of PAHs in the reaction mixture is expected to facilitate
the formation of CDs. Further, the presence of N-containing compounds
(nicotine and other aromatic amines) is known to promote the formation
of CDs and improve the QY by N-doping and amine passivation. Furthermore,
sulfuric acid can also serve as S dopant to produce S and N-codoped
CDs with improved QY.46 The crucial role
of sulfuric acid is evident from the blank experiment (double-distilled
(DD) water is used instead of sulfuric acid), which resulted in CDs
with very low QY (3%) and insignificant production yield. To obtain
the best CDs out of waste CBs, process parameters like reaction temperature,
time, and concentration of acid were optimized (Tables S1 and S2). Under optimal conditions, CDs with QY as
high as 26% were obtained with a production yield of 9.6%. A comparison
(Table S3) with several previous reports
on the production of CDs from waste materials revealed the advantageous
features (mild synthetic conditions and higher QY and production yield)
of the present method.

of Fluorescent CDs from
Cigarette Butts
Physicochemical Properties
The structure and morphological
features of CBCDs were explored by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis. As presented in Figure 1a, CBCDs possess spherical morphology, are uniform
in size, and are well separated from each other. The corresponding
size distribution histogram obtained by counting 100 nanoparticles
is represented in Figure 1b. Gaussian fitting of the histogram unveiled the statistical
diameter of CBCDs as 3.7 ± 1.4. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image
(inset of Figure 1a)
revealed that most of the CBCDs have clear lattice structure with
a fringe spacing of 0.24 nm, which agrees with the basal spacing of
(1120) lattice plane of graphene.47 Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CBCDs (shown in Figure 1c) presented a single broad
peak centered at 2θ = 24.3 indexed to the (002) lattice spacing
of graphitic carbon, indicating the graphite-like structure of CBCDs.
The interlayer spacing d (0.37 nm) is larger than
that of graphite (0.34 nm), articulating the incomplete graphitization
and can be attributed to the introduction of oxygen-containing functional
groups or owing to the existence of organic functional groups on the
surface.48 Graphitization is further confirmed
by Raman analysis, which exhibited two broad peaks (Figure 1d) centered at 1359 and 1548
cm–1 corresponding to the D and G bands, respectively.
The D band is a measure of disorder in the graphite lattice in the
sense that it corresponds to the A1g (zone-edge) breathing
vibration phonon that is only activated in the presence of a neighboring
sp3 defect.49 The G band corresponds
to the E2g mode of graphite and is related to the vibration
of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal
lattice.50 The integrated intensity ratio
of D and G bands (ID/IG), which is characteristic of the extent of disorder
and functionalization (ratio of sp3/sp2 carbons),
is found to be 0.66, signifying the partial disordered graphite-like
structure of CBCDs.41

HRTEM image), (b) particle size distribution,
(c) XRD pattern, and (d) Raman spectrum of CBCDs.

The elemental composition of CBCDs revealed by scanning electron
microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) (Figure S1a) is found to be C (64.70%), N (8.37%), O (25.27%),
and S (1.66%). The surface functional groups of CBCDs were characterized
through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure S1b). The broad vibrational band in the
range of 3600–3100 cm –1 can be attributed
to the stretching vibrations of N–H and O–H. A strong
band at 1641 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching
modes of C=N/C=O stretching vibration. The peaks at
1568 and 1375 cm–1 can be assigned to C=C
bond stretching and C–H vibrations, respectively.11 The vibrational band at 1047 cm–1 is assigned to the presence of −SO3–, C–O–C, and C–O bonds. The peak at 1313 cm–1 can be due to C(sp2)–N and C–S
bonds,42 while the peak at 1155 cm–1 is ascribed to C–O, C–N, and C–S
bonds.14 Further information regarding
the nature of bonds and chemical composition of CBCDs was obtained
from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectrum
(Figure 2a) of CBCDs
presented four peaks at 168, 285, 400, and 532 eV, which are ascribed
to S 2p, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s signals, respectively. The high-resolution
C 1s spectrum (Figure 2b) reveals four types of carbon bonds: sp3 (C–C
and C–H) at 284.2 eV, sp2 (C=C) at 285.7
eV, C–S/C–N/C–O at 287.2 eV, and C=O/C=N
at 288.7 eV.47 High-resolution N 1s spectrum
(Figure 2c) designates
the existence of pyridinic N s, 1°/2° amino N s (399.0 eV),
and pyrrolic N s (400.7 eV). S 2p spectrum (Figure 2d) can be resolved into three distinct peaks
at 167.5, 168.7, and 169.5 eV, which designates the existence of C–SOx (x = 2, 3, 4) on the surface
of CBCDs.42 ζ potential of the as-prepared
CBCDs suspension was found to be −14.9 mV, demonstrating the
negative surface charge of CBCDs (Figure S2). All of these results manifested the occurrence of multiple functional
groups like −OH, −C=O, −COOH, and −NH
and successful doping of N, S elements in the CB-derived CDs.

Optical Properties
The UV–vis absorption, excitation,
and emission spectra are represented in Figure 3a. As shown in the figure, the absorption
spectrum displays two poorly resolved bands around 270 and 320 nm,
which can be ascribed to the π–π* transition of
carbonic core center and n−π* transition of heteroatomic
surface functionalities or molecule center, respectively.51 Similar to several previous reports, aqueous
solution of CBCDs exhibit bright blue emission under 365 nm UV light,
and it appeared transparent and pale yellow under daylight (inset
of Figure 3a). The
corresponding excitation spectrum shows two peaks, which can be ascribed
to core and surface excitations. Like most of the fluorescent CDs,
CBCDs also exhibited excitation tunable emission behavior. A steady
increase in λex from 300 to 480 nm resulted in a
red shift in the emission peak position along with a concurrent first
increase and then decrease in the emission intensity (Figure 3b). This red shift can be clearly
observed in the corresponding normalized emission spectra (Figure S3). This tunable emission is considered
to be the versatile characteristic of CDs and has been most prominently
ascribed to the selective excitation of subsets of CDs within the
CD ensemble.52 The maximum emission peak
centered at 430 nm was observed under the excitation of 360 nm with
a large stokes shift of 70 nm. As presented in Figure S4, the fluorescence QY of CBCDs at room temperature
was calculated to be 26% (using quinine sulfate (QS) as reference),
which is greater compared to various previous reports (Table S3). The reason for this higher QY may
be due to the synergistic effect of doped N and S atoms.43

Stability
In view
of the fact that fluorescence emission
of many fluorescent probes can be disrupted by the complex environmental
conditions, we have examined the emission spectra of CBCDs under diverse
conditions to verify their practical applicability. The effect of
ionic strength was examined by recording the emission spectra under
various KCl concentrations. As depicted in Figure S5a, only a slight diminution in the photoluminescence (PL)
intensity is observed even at a high KCl concentration of 2 M, which
verifies the excellent stability of CBCDs under high-ionic-strength
environments and outspreads their usage to identical ion-rich biological
conditions. As shown in Figure S5b, change
in the solution pH did not alter the peak position, but caused fluctuations
in the emission intensity. No significant alteration in the emission
intensity is recorded over a pH range of 5–9, which is a beneficial
property for the fluorescent probe to be used in complex biological
system and practical applications. Photostability studies revealed
their excellent property of resistance to photobleaching (Figure S5c). As presented in Figure S5d, the fluorescence intensity of CBCDs was found
almost stable in the temperature range of 25–45 °C representing
their thermal stability. Further, the storage stability of CBCDs was
examined by keeping those under (1) ambient conditions and (2) refrigerator
for 60 days. Virtually no fluctuations in their emission intensity
and no obvious precipitation were observed in both the cases (Figure S6), demonstrating their great stability
and long shelf life.

Detection of Fe3+ and AA
The aforementioned
optical merits, along with the existence of abundant surface functional
groups encouraged us to further investigate the possible sensing applications
of CBCDs. According to several previous reports, the surface functional
groups of CDs can selectively interact with metal ions and produce
a fluorescence change; thus, we have studied the fluorescence response
of CBCDs toward various biologically and environmentally important
metal ions, such as Fe2+, Ca2+, Na+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Sn2+, Cr3+, Al3+, Ni2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, K+, Zn2+, and Fe3+. As shown in Figure S7, among all ions, only Fe3+ caused a severe
decline in the PL intensity, which unveiled the applicability of CBCDs
as highly selective turn-off fluorescent probes for Fe3+ detection. This discrimination effect for Fe3+ can be
credited to the special coordination between electron-deficient Fe3+ ions and electron-rich surface functional groups of CBCDs.46 In the course of developing an efficient probe,
some critical parameters, including usage concentration of CBCDs,
incubation time, and solution pH, were optimized. In general, in the
presence of quencher of a given concentration, lower concentration
of fluorophore will result in greater sensitivity and higher concentration
will achieve a broader detection range;53 hence, through comprehensive consideration of both sensitivity (limit
of detection (LOD)) and linear detection range, 0.05 mg mL–1 of CBCDs was selected as optimum. Quenching kinetic investigations
(Figure S8a) revealed that 2 min of interaction
with Fe3+ is sufficient to produce maximum fluorescence
response, which remained stable in the following 20 min of observation,
suggesting the complexation between Fe3+ and CBCDs is quick
and stable, which is useful in rapid sensing without strict time control.54 As presented in Figure S8b, Fe3+ ions were able to produce decent response in the
pH range of 6–9, which is beneficial as most environmental
and biological samples lie in this pH scale and maximum response is
achieved at pH 7, which is taken as optimum.

Under optimal circumstances,
sensitivity was inspected by computing the fluorescence response of
CBCDs to several concentrations of Fe3+ in the range of
0–100 μM. As depicted in Figure 4a, the PL intensity gradually dwindled with
increasing concentrations of Fe3+. The plot of quenching
efficiency (F0/F) versus
Fe3+ concentration (Figure 4b) displayed a good linearity (R2 = 0.998) in the range of 0–100 μM, where F0 and F are the PL intensities
of CBCDs at 430 nm in the absence and presence of Fe3+,
respectively. The detection limit (LOD) was estimated to be 0.13 μM
based on the equation 3σ/m, where σ is
the standard deviation of the blank signal (n = 6)
and m is the slope of the linear fit. The LOD presented
by our method (0.13 μM) is much lower than the maximum permissible
limit (5.36 μM) stipulated by World Health Organization (WHO)
and LOD presented by other researchers for Fe3+ in drinking
water.55 Comparison of analytical performance
of CBCDs nanoprobe with several chosen probes in the literature (Table S4) revealed the superiority of the present
sensor in terms of linear range, LOD, and applicability to real samples.

10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 100 μM). (c) Fluorescence response (F/F0) of CBCDs toward various
metal ions (black) and subsequent addition of Fe3+ ions

40, 60, 80, 100 μM). (f) Fluorescence response (F/F0) of CBCDs/Fe3+ system
toward various commonly interfering species.

With inherent complexity, metal-ion detection in real samples
poses
a great challenge to the analytical methods not only in terms of sensitivity
but more importantly in selectivity. Hence, to further explore the
applicability of the proposed nanoprobe to real samples, selectivity
and competition experiments were carried out. The black bars shown
in Figure 4c depict
the PL response (F/F0) of CBCDs to various metal ions each at a concentration of 200 μM.
It is evident that none of these metal ions caused a considerable
decline in the PL intensity. Competition experiments were conducted
by subsequently adding 100 μM of Fe3+ to the above
solutions. As represented by the red bars in Figure 4c, no substantial change in the PL response
(F/F0) appeared in the
co-presence of Fe3+ and other metal ions in comparison
to that of Fe3+ alone. All of these results clearly demonstrated
the excellent selectivity of CBCD-based nanoprobe and motivated us
to investigate their practical applicability in real samples.

It is observed that the quenched fluorescence of CBCDs/Fe3+ can be recovered by the addition of AA. This can be attributed to
the (i) antioxidant nature of AA, which can reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and (ii) the high selectivity of CBCDs toward
Fe3+ over Fe2+. Moreover, AA did not exhibit
any significant effect on the fluorescence of CBCDs alone. Hence,
the CBCDs/Fe3+ system can be employed as a turn on fluorescent
probe for the detection of AA (Scheme 2). Kinetic investigations disclosed that, 10 min of
interaction with AA recovered the emission of CBCDs/Fe3+ system to a stable value (Figure S9),
and this 10 min is taken as the incubation time for the assay. Sensitivity
of CBCDs/Fe3+ system toward AA is evaluated by recording
its fluorescence response to various concentrations of AA. As presented
in Figure 4d, the emission
intensity of CBCDs/Fe3+ nicely recovered with increase
in the concentration of AA, and the plot of F/F0 versus AA concentration (Figure 4e) demonstrated a good linearity
(R2 = 0.996) in the range of 0.5–100
μM, where F0 and F are the emission intensities of CBCDs/Fe3+ at 430 nm
in the absence and presence of AA, respectively. The detection limit
(LOD) was estimated to be 0.2 μM based on the equation 3σ/m, where σ is the standard deviation of the blank
signal (n = 6) and m is the slope
of the linear fit. Selectivity of the probe is evaluated by studying
the interference of various amino acids, anions, and sugars. As depicted
in Figure 4f, the probe
presented greater selectivity, which opened their further applicability
to real samples. The sensing performance (linear range and limit of
detection) of the present probe is compared to that of several reported
methods (Table S5), which revealed that
the presented method is among the best methods reported so far.

Scheme 2 Schematic Illustration of On–Off–On Detection of Fe3+ and Ascorbic Acid
Analysis of Real Samples
Practical applicability of
CBCDs nanoprobe was assessed by detecting Fe3+ in real
water (tap, bore, and pond) and AA in complex biological (human urine
and serum) samples. To avoid the particulate matter, real water samples
are subjected to centrifugation and filtration (0.45 μm membrane
filter). Serum and urine samples are subjected to a 100-fold dilution
with PBS before analysis. Then, the water samples were spiked with
various concentrations of standard Fe3+ solution, and the
serum and urine samples were spiked with AA and analyzed by the proposed
method. As shown in Tables S6 and S7, good
recoveries (98–102) and high analytical precision with RDS
3.2 (n = 6) were obtained. Furthermore, the nanoprobe
is validated by comparing the results of Fe3+ and AA detection
in a real sample to those of a standard method (atomic absorption
spectrometry for Fe3+ and high-performance liquid chromatography–UV
for AA). These results confirm the reliability and feasibility of
the proposed nanosensor for monitoring Fe3+ in environmental
and AA in biological samples.

Possible Mechanism of Fluorescence
Quenching
In general,
several sorts of molecular interactions between the fluorophore and
quencher such as electron or energy transfer, excited-state reaction,
collisional quenching, and ground-state complex formation can lead
to fluorescence quenching.56 The quenching
mechanisms are typically classified into (1) dynamic quenching, involving
the transfer of electron from excited-state fluorophore to ground-state
quencher by means of collision and (2) static quenching resulting
from the formation of a nonfluorescent ground-state complex between
the fluorophore and quencher.

To explore the possible mechanism
of quenching of CBCDs fluorescence by Fe3+ ions, the standard
Stern–Volmer equation is applied.  where F0 and F refer
to the fluorescence intensities of CBCDs in the
absence and presence of quencher (Fe3+), respectively; Ksv and kq represent
the Stern–Volmer quenching constant and bimolecular quenching
constant, respectively; [Q] is the concentration of quencher (Fe3+); and τ0 is the average lifetime of CBCDs
in the absence of quencher.

As depicted in Figure 4b, the plot of F0/F versus [Q] exhibited a good linear
correlation (correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.998) and the Stern–Volmer quenching
constant (Ksv) was found to be 2.2 ×
104 M–1. The excellent linear correlation
infers that the observed quenching is either purely dynamic or purely
static and rules out the possibility of static–dynamic combination.51 In principle, fluorescence lifetime measurement
is the most definitive method to distinguish dynamic and static quenching
processes.57 In light of this, fluorescence
lifetime quenching analysis is carried out to confirm the nature of
quenching. Figure 5a reveals that the PL lifetime of CBCDs is not quenched by Fe3+ ions, which rule out the possibility of dynamic quenching.
The bimolecular quenching constant (kq) calculated from Ksv and average lifetime
τ0 (5.26 ns) is found to be 4.18 × 1013 M–1 s–1, which is higher than
the diffusion-controlled limit (1010 M–1 s–1) and further supports the static quenching
mechanism involving the ground-state complex formation. Decline in
the quenching constant with rise in the temperature (Figure 5b) further supported the static
quenching process. All of these findings designate that the quenching
caused by Fe3+ ions is a result of nonfluorescent complex
formed between the surface functional groups of CBCDs and Fe3+ ions. FTIR spectral analysis was further used to verify this assumption.
As shown in Figure S10, evident changes
(especially at the characteristic peaks of C–O, C–N,
and SOx–) were observed
in the FTIR spectrum of CBCDs after the addition of Fe3+, which further confirmed that Fe3+ indeed coordinated
with these surface functional groups of CBCDs.

Cytotoxicity and Cellular Imaging
With the grander
optical properties like bright fluorescence (QY = 26%), high ionic
strength, and tolerance to photobleaching and complex environmental
conditions, the CBCDs showcase a great potential to serve as bioimaging
agents. However, like various biological applications, low cytotoxicity
is the key requirement for a material to be used as bioimaging agent
also. Hence, we have evaluated the inherent cytotoxicity of CBCDs
toward human normal (HEK-293) and human cancerous (HeLa) cells. Standard
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
cell viability assay is employed for this purpose. As shown in Figure S11, CBCDs did not exhibit substantial
toxicity on both cancerous and noncancerous cells and the cell viabilities
remain 85% even at a concentration of 1000 μg mL–1, denoting their excellent biocompatibility. An important observation
is that, at the dosage used for bioimaging (200 μg mL–1), virtually no toxicity is witnessed (cell viability is over 95%),
which indicated that the CBCDs have great potential for biomedical
applications such as in vivo imaging, cellular labeling, and medical
imaging.58 These results are in agreement
with similar studies carried out earlier.59 Further, it is interesting to note that CDs derived from toxic CBs
did not exhibit any toxicity toward human normal and cancerous cells
demonstrating their versatility.

Cellular imaging potential
of CBCDs was evaluated by performing the in vitro cellular uptake
experiments with HeLa cells. After incubating with 200 μg mL–1 CBCDs for 6 h, the cells were imaged under a confocal
laser scanning microscope. As shown in Figure 6, the cells were brightly illuminated with
blue, green, and red colors under the excitation of 408, 488, and
543 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, the control cells did not display
any detectable fluorescence under the same exposure conditions. A
closer observation of the images revealed that the fluorescence glow
is mainly confined to cell membrane and cytoplasmic area while the
nucleus had only a weak glow. These results indicate that, similar
to some previous reports,60 CBCDs were
also having difficulties in labeling the nucleus, while the cytoplasm
and cell membrane are easily stained.

Figure 6 Confocal microscopic images of HeLa cells:
cells treated with 200
μg mL–1 CBCDs for 6 h; cells (CBCDs treated)
further treated with 200 μM Fe3+ for 1 h; and cells
(CBCDs/Fe3+ treated) further treated with 500 μM
AA for 1 h, and images taken under three excitation wavelengths of
405 nm (blue), 488 nm (green), and 561 nm (red).

Intracellular Detection of Fe3+ and AA
It
has been reported that overload and deficiency of Fe3+ can
disturb the cellular homeostasis, resulting in various diseases.61 Hence, developing a simple and sensitive probe
for monitoring intracellular Fe3+ is of great importance.
Impressed by the favorable biocompatibility, cell imaging ability,
and high selectivity, CBCDs were further applied for monitoring Fe3+ in live cells by introducing exogenous Fe3+ into
the CBCD-pretreated HeLa cells. As expected, the confocal microscopic
images taken after supplementing cells with 200 μM Fe3+ in the growth medium exhibited very weak intracellular fluorescence
(Figure 6). Further
treatment of cells with AA resulted in the nicely recovered intracellular
fluorescence indicating that emission of CBCDs/Fe3+ in
the cells can be recovered by AA. It can be observed that the fluorescence
emission of the cells is in the order of CBCDs > CBCDs/Fe3+/AA > CBCDs/Fe3+ treated. All of these results elucidate
that CBCDs could serve as efficient fluorescent probe for “on–off–on”
detection of Fe3+ and AA in living cells.

Logic Operations
of CBCDs
The fluorescence switching
behavior of CBCDs in the presence of Fe3+ and AA can be
employed as multiple molecular logic gates, performing the Boolean
algebraic logic operations.62 The simple
single input molecular logic gate NOT can be constructed using Fe3+ as single input signal (Figure 7a). The multiple input logic gate IMPLICATION
can be realized by taking Fe3+ and AA as input 1 and input
2, respectively. The presence of Fe3+ or AA is taken as
1 and their absence as 0. For output, the maximum fluorescence was
taken as 1 and the corresponding quenched fluorescence as 0. As shown
in Figure 7b, only
in the presence of Fe3+ and absence of AA, i.e., input
(1, 0), significant fluorescent quenching is observed and provided
output as 0, while in the case of other inputs (0/0, 0/1, 1/1), the
output remains 1. The logic symbol, truth table, and output fluorescence
intensity at 430 nm are shown in Figure 7.

inputs.

Fluorescent Ink and Polymer
Finding novel applications
to emerging materials like CDs is always important. Here, CBCDs possess
unique properties, including strong and stable fluorescence and good
transparency in the visible region, which makes them suitable candidates
for fluorescent ink applications.63 To
explore this, a sketch pen is filled with CBCDs aqueous solution (Figure S12) and employed for writing some text
on commercial filter paper. As shown in Figure 8, the words “Osmania University”
are clearly visible (showing blue fluorescence) under UV light, whereas
the filter paper appeared as blank under daylight. It is worth mentioning
that the information on the filter paper remained consistent and can
be reproducible even after 30 days (when stored under ambient conditions)
(Figure S13). These observations suggest
that the CBCDs can be used as invisible ink for loading important
information for secret communications and have a great potential for
anticounterfeiting applications. Furthermore, with their high biocompatibility
(low/nontoxic nature), CBCDs can be safely used as ink pads to form
human fingerprints that do not contaminate the fingers.27Figure 8c characterizes the CBCDs-formed fluorescent fingerprint on
commercial filter paper, which could reflect human fingerprint clearly.
Thus, the water-soluble CBCDs-based fluorescent ink could serve as
an alternative to the traditional inks to form a clear, adelomorphic,
long-lasting, and blue fluorescent fingerprint that can be easily
cleaned with water and is pollution free.64

ink under (a) daylight and (b) 365 nm UV light. (c) CBCDs-formed fingerprints
under 365 nm UV light.

Further extending their applicability to solid-state optic-related
fields is interesting and challenging. Efficient solid-state PL emission
of CDs is extremely important for light-emitting diode (LED) applications.
However, CDs in the solid state generally suffer from self-quenching
because of the aggregation-caused quenching effect, which might be
a result of excessive Forster resonance energy transfer among adjacent
CD particles in the aggregated state or direct π–π
interaction.65 Dispersing CDs in the polymer
matrix is considered to be an effective strategy to avoid this. Here,
we have prepared solid-state films by dispersing CBCDs in poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA). PVA was selected as polymer host because of its known
high optical quality and desirable film properties.66 The as-fabricated films are highly transparent (about 90%
transmittance in the entire visible region) under daylight, while
exhibited bright blue fluorescence under UV illumination (Figure 9). The absorption
spectra (Figure S14a) of CBCDs in the polymer
film is similar to those in solution, and the emission spectra (Figure S14b) also exhibited a similar excitation-dependent
behavior.

Figure 9 CBCDs/PVA film (a) under daylight, (b) under 365 nm UV light, and
(c) corresponding transmittance spectra and fluorescence spectra under
optimal excitation of 357 nm.

In comparison to CBCDs aqueous solution, the optimal emission
spectra
of CBCDs/PVA film exhibited a blue shift of 6 nm and a slight red
shift (3 nm) in the optimal excitation wavelength (Figure S15), which might be due to the fact that PVA environment
is different from aqueous solution.67 The
fluorescence QY of CBCDs in PVA matrix determined using QS as reference
was found to be 33% (Table S8), which is
higher than that in aqueous solution. This enhancement in the QY can
be ascribed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between PVA and surface
functional groups of CDs, which provide a stabilization effect on
the electrons and holes for more efficient radiative recombination.63 A similar enhancement was observed in some previous
reports also.63,66 Furthermore, the optical properties
of CBCDs/PVA films are quite stable and no obvious decrease in PL
emission is observed even after 24 h of continuous exposure to UV
light (365 nm) (Figure S16). With improved
and stable optical properties, CBCDs/PVA films have a great potential
to serve as light conversion film/phosphor material in solid-state
lighting systems.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully demonstrated a simple one-step
hydrothermal method for the production of highly fluorescent (QY =
26%) N,S-codoped CDs from toxic CBs for the first time. Moderate reaction
conditions, using waste as starting material, good production yield
(9.6%), and multifunctional nature of the formed products (CBCDs)
make our method economical and scalable. The as-produced CBCDs were
well characterized and explored for multiple applications. Bright
and stable fluorescence coupled with high biocompatibility made CBCDs
a potential candidate for bioimaging applications. They were successfully
applied as “on–off–on” fluorescent probe
for the sequential detection of Fe3+ and AA in real water
and biological samples. CBCDs were further employed as biocompatible
and invisible ink for loading data and forming fingerprints. The “visible–invisible”
and “UV–visible” properties of CBCDs promise
their applicability in anticounterfeiting. Furthermore, the CBCDs/PVA
films with strong and stable emission might find direct or indirect
applications in various optical/optoelectronic devices, ranging from
fluorescent displays to LEDs.

Experimental Section
Materials
Cigarette
butts were collected from the ash
trays of a local bar and restaurant. All of the chemicals were of
analytical grade and used without further purification. All solutions
were prepared by using double-distilled (DD) water.

Synthesis of
Carbon Dots
CBs (0.5 g) were cut into
small pieces (paper wrap was removed to avoid dust particles) and
placed in a 100 mL of Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 mL of 40% H2SO4 and sonicated for 1 h. Then, the formed dispersion
was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave
and heated at 180 °C for 6 h in an electric oven. After cooling
down to room temperature, the obtained solution was centrifuged to
remove large particles. Then, the solution was neutralized with Na2CO3, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.22 μm
syringe filter to remove the formed precipitate. Afterward, the solution
was purified by dialyzing against DD water for 24 h using a dialysis
tubing (molecular weight cut-off 3500 Da). Finally, CBCDs powder was
obtained by freeze drying and used for the preparation of stock solution
(1 mg mL–1).

Characterization
Fluorescence spectral measurements
were carried out using a JASCO spectrofluorometer (FP-8500) set with
excitation and emission slit widths at 2.5 nm. UV–vis spectral
studies were conducted on a Shimadzu UV–vis–NIR 3600
spectrophotometer. Fluorescence decay analysis was done on a Fluoro
Cube, Lifetime System (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 370 nm Nano LED excitation
source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired
on a JEOL 3010 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of
200 kV by drop-casting a proper dilution of CBCDs aqueous solution
onto the carbon-coated copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were carried out by Kratos AXIS Ultra spectrometer
with Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source (1486.71 eV). Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was recorded on a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21
spectrophotometer. ζ potential measurements were conducted using
a Malvern, Nano ZS90 Zetasizer. Raman spectra were measured with a
Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR with a focal length of 800 mm and equipped
with a He–Ne 633 nm Laser. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of CBCDs were obtained using an X’pert Pro powder X-ray diffractometer
(the Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å.

Calculation of QY
QYs of all of the CBCD samples were
calculated by using the slope method in which quinine sulfate (QS)
is chosen as standard (Φ = 54%). This particular method first
involves the preparation of several concentrations of CBCDs aqueous
solutions and QS 0.1 M H2SO4 solutions by maintaining
the absorbance values less than 0.1 at their excitation wavelengths.
Subsequently, the integrated emission intensities of all of the samples
were recorded by exciting at 360 nm. Afterward, the integrated emission
intensities were plotted against corresponding absorbance values and
the slope values of the obtained linear plots were computed. Finally,
quantum yields were calculated by using the following equation  where Φ is the quantum yield, Grad is
the gradient from the plot of integrated emission intensity versus
absorbance, and η is the refractive index of the solvent (1.33
for both solvents). The subscripts st and x denote standard (QS) and
CBCDs, respectively.

Detection of Fe3+ and Ascorbic
Acid
Solutions
of all metal ions used in this experiment are prepared from corresponding
salts in DD water. At room temperature, 1 mL of DD water is added
to 1 mL of CBCDs aqueous solution (0.1 mg mL–1),
the emission spectra of this sample are recorded at an excitation
wavelength of 360 nm, and the emission intensity at 430 nm is denoted
as F0. In a similar manner, 1 mL of different
metal ion solutions of 200 μM concentration were added to 1
mL of CBCD solution, shaken well, and incubated for 2 min and thereafter
the emission intensity is recorded as F. A similar
procedure was followed for the quantitative determination of Fe3+. In a typical assay, 1 mL of CBCDs solution was mixed with
1 mL of Fe3+ solution of varying concentrations. For the
detection of ascorbic acid (AA), first, 0.5 mL of Fe3+ is
added to 0.5 mL of CBCDs solution and then 1 mL of AA with varying
concentrations was added. The final concentrations of Fe3+ and CBCDs are 100 μM and 0.05 mg mL–1, respectively.
After 10 min of incubation, fluorescence response in recorded.

Cytotoxicity
and Cellular Imaging
Standard MTT assay
was employed for evaluating the in vitro cytotoxicity of cigarette
butt-derived CDs. Experimental studies were performed on both normal
(HEK-293) and cancerous (HeLa) cell lines. Complete details are provided
in the Supporting Information.

Preparation
of Fluorescent Films (CBCDs/PVA Composite Films)
Poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) (1 g) is added to 10 mL of DD water under
constant stirring, and the mixture was heated to dissolve PVA. After
that, 1 mL of 1 mg mL–1 CBCDs aqueous solution was
added to 9 mL of PVA solution and stirred gently for 10 min. Finally,
the mixture was drop-casted onto a clean glass slide and dried in
an oven. After drying, the film was peeled off from the glass substrate
to get a freestanding film.
