Two series of ultraviolet (UV)-cured
self-healing polyurethane
(PU) oligomers were synthesized through a prepolymer process from
isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) or 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI),
polycarbonate diol (PCDL) of varying molecular weight (500, 1000,
and 2000 Da), and chemically modified cyclotriphosphazene as hard
cores were introduced. The synthesized oligomers contained rigid aromatic
rings as “hard cores” and long fatty chains as “flexible
arms”. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (H NMR) and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize
the structures of the oligomers. In addition, the UV-cured self-healing
PU coatings were prepared by designing some coating formulations with
the PU oligomers. The self-healing properties and mechanical properties
of the UV-cured coatings were investigated. The results revealed that
the coatings had self-healing properties based on hydrogen bonds.
As the molecular weight of PCDL decreased, the coatings exhibited
increased hardness, tensile strength, and glass transition temperature.
Furthermore, the coatings exhibited excellent thermostability. The
results proved the application prospects of the self-healing coatings
with high repair efficiency and excellent mechanical properties.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
ability to repair itself after being damaged, which is defined
“self-healing”, is an common phenomenon in nature.1,2 The development of self-healing coatings is highly desirable because
it greatly enhances the durability and longevity of the coating while
reducing the adverse effects of the surrounding environment, such
as physical and chemical damage.3−8 Thus far, two kinds of self-healing coatings have been developed:
(I) extrinsic self-healing coatings, need to pre-embed the healing
agent firstly and (II) intrinsic self-healing coatings that can repair
damage by reversible physical or chemical interactions of the polymer
itself.9−13 For the extrinsic self-healing, the damage can only be repaired
once at the specific location, whereas the intrinsic self-healing
could heal itself multiple times. Therefore, in recent years, more
and more researchers have paid attention to intrinsic self-healing
materials and have achieved many achievements.14−17

Many types of polymers
have been used in the study of self-healing
coatings, and the mobility of polymer chains is an important factor
in ensuring self-healing ability.18 The
healing can only be achieved when the molecular chain diffuses to
the damage interface.19,20 Therefore, most existing self-healing
polymers are soft owing to their low glass transition temperature
(Tg). However, a self-healing coating
characterized by high hardness is required for industrial and aerospace
applications. To solve this problem, Guan et al.21 reported a novel self-healing polymer that could achieve
repair of damage without any external stimulation. Structurally, this
polymer contains the hard–soft microphase-separated system.
The acetylamino polymer as soft phase provides the reversible hydrogen
bonding for self-healing, and the rigid polystyrene as hard phase
provides strength to the material. This is an effective approach to
solving the problem associated with intrinsic self-healing coatings.

Recently, a few publications have reported the polymers with “hard
core, flexible arm” structures. Our research group successfully
prepared ultraviolet (UV)-curable cardanol-based polymers with “hard
core, flexible shell” structures to be used as coatings. The
surface mechanical properties of these coatings, such as hardness,
reduced modulus, surface storage modulus, and storage stiffness, constituted
a considerable improvement.22 Liu and Chung
reported a new functional polymer containing lignin, lignin-graft-poly(5-acetylaminopentyl acrylate) (lignin-graft-PAA), a terminally functionalized polymer obtained
by covalently bonding chemically modified lignin to PAA. The polymer
had both a rigid lignin phase and a rubber-like PAA soft phase, but
the two could be well dispersed to form a multiphase microstructure.
The samples also exhibited good self-healing properties and recovered
to 93% of the maximum tensile stress of the original sample after
repair.23 Therefore, the systematic study
of the application of such polymers in self-healing coatings is of
great significance.

In this paper, “hard core, flexible
arm” polyurethane
(PU) with photo-sensitive groups was synthesized by using the rigid
group as the “core” and the flexible segment as the
“arm”. The polymers were used to prepare a UV-cured
self-healing coating and then investigated properties of the polymer
coating, such as hardness, gloss, and adhesion. The results revealed
that the polymer coatings exhibited good adhesion, gloss, and high
repair efficiency. These results provide a new strategy for preparing
self-healing coatings with good repair performance and excellent mechanical
properties, thereby promoting the further development of related research.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
of UV-Cured Self-Healing
PU
The 1H NMR spectra of IPxHy and HPxHy are shown in Figure 1, as depicted in the 1H NMR spectrum. The resonances of N–H were observed at 6.87–7.13
ppm, and the chemical shift of double bonds (C=C) was δ
= 5.69 and 6.03 ppm, indicating that the photosensitive double bonds
had been successfully grafted to the prepolymer based on the reaction
between isocyanates and hydroxyl27 and
the signals within the 7.14–7.27 and 6.76–6.85 ppm ranges
that were connected to the benzene ring in the cyclotriphosphazene
monomer. The product was successfully synthesized. Water was an impurity
doped in the process of purification. Simultaneously combined with
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum to monitor
the reaction process and the structure of IPxHy or HPxHy, the FTIR spectra are shown
in Figure S3.

Table 1 shows
the
molecular weights and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of synthesized
PU samples. The addition of polycarbonate diol (PCDL) with a high
molecular weight will further generate longer flexible segments, resulting
in an increase in the molecular weight of PU.

2.2 Characterization of Hydrogen Bonds
We envisioned that in our “hard core, flexible arm”
structural design, the self-healing properties of polymer were due
to the presence of reversible hydrogen bonds in the soft arm. Therefore,
we performed a further in-depth investigation of the hydrogen bond
through nuclear magnetic shift and rheological spectra of samples
at different temperatures refer to previous studies.14,28Figure 2 showed the 1H NMR spectra of HP500H6 at four temperatures
(25, 50, 75, and 100 °C), as can be seen from the spectra, the
N–H shifts will change with the temperature. When the temperature
increased, the chemical shift of N–H moved to a lower field,
indicating the existence of reversible hydrogen bonds in our polymer
network. At higher temperatures, more hydrogen bonds were destroyed,
the density of electron clouds around protons increased, as a result,
enhanced the shielding effect and reduced the chemical shift. Based
on these observations, when the chain segment moved to the damaged
place, the hydrogen bond was formed again to repair the scratch. The 1H NMR spectra of IP500H6 at four temperatures
(25, 50, 75, and 100 °C) shown in Figure S4 all exhibit the same trend.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of HP500H6 of different
temperature.

There were two relaxation
modes for characterizing the melt-rheology
properties of hydrogen-bonded polymers, one was due to the polymer
itself and another was due to the reversibility hydrogen bonding in
the polymer, which could be opened and closed with thermo-reversibly.
As shown in Figures 3 and S5,29,30 we investigated
the rheological properties of HP500H6 and IP500H6 by measuring the change of loss modulus with
frequency at different temperatures. The loss modulus was found to
have a significant frequency dependence, when the frequency increased,
the loss modulus gradually increased, and when the temperature rose,
it gradually decreased. This could be attributable to temperature
rise caused hydrogen bond rupture, which affected the dependence of
loss modulus on frequency. In addition, the temperature increase perturbed
the equilibrium and kinetics of the hydrogen bond association, thereby
minimizing the effects on the loss modulus. This result combined with
the chemical shift of hydrogen bonds in 1H NMR at various
temperatures could prove the existence of hydrogen bond networks in
polymers.

various temperatures and frequencies.

2.3 Self-Healing Properties of Coatings
When the surface of coating was damaged, the hydrogen bond between
the chains was broken by heating. At the same time, with an increase
in temperature, the mobility of the soft segment increased and enables
the chains to move to the broken interface. Finally, the coating cooled
down, and through the reconstruction of hydrogen networks, the surface
healed according to the design shown in Figure 4. The self-healing performance of coatings
based on IPxHy or HPxHy were investigated through ultra-deep-field three-dimensional (3D)
microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A razor was used to
scratch a series of sample, followed by heating to 100 °C to
repair it subsequently. From a series of data, it can be seen that
the scratch of the self-healing coating could be almost fully repaired.

Figure 4 Schematic
diagram of the repair process of self-healing coating.

The self-healing property was evaluated through
a scratch repair
test first. The scratched coatings on a heating plate were placed
at the specified temperature for a specified period, and the scratch
repair process was monitored through optical microscopy; from Figure 5 we could see the
process. For the coatings based on IPxHy, that based on IP500H6 or IP1000H6 had the optimal healing
ability; surface damage to this coating disappeared after the coating
was heated at 100 °C. The presence of hydrogen bonding in PU
provided shape memory and healing ability, and the soft chain provided
flexibility when the coating was healing.30 However, the healing performance of IP2000H6 was unclear because of a lower hydrogen bond proportion in the IP2000H6 coating. At the same time, the softer segments
caused the entanglement of chains and reduced chain mobility. In addition,
the coating based on HP500H6 or HP1000H6 had excellent healing ability. By contrast, the HP2000H6 had a longer polymer chain, which caused
entanglement between the segments, making it difficult to diffuse
to the scratch interface, resulting in poor repair effect.

and after healing at 100 °C for periods of varying length. Before
healing: (A) IP500H6; (B) IP1000H6; (C) IP2000H6; (D) IP500H6; (E) HP500H6; (F) HP1000H6; and (G) HP2000H6; and (H) HP500H6. After healing for (a) 5; (b) 5; (c) 60; (d)

We further explored the relatively high repair performance
of the
coatings based on IP500H6, IP1000H6, HP500H6, and HP1000H6. AFM images of these coatings captured before and after
healing are shown in Figures 6 and S6. All of these coatings
were healed through the same way within 1 min. This was consistent
with the above micrograph results, it proved that when the coating
was damaged to some extent, the coatings could achieve the self-healing
effect. The healing process could be observed in Movies S1–S4.

for 1 min: (a); (b); (c); and (d), respectively.

2.4 Properties of the Cured Coatings
Regarding the hardness of the coating with a better repair effect,
we further studied the hardness of a coating with excellent repair
performance. When the molecular weight of PCDL increased (Table 1), the basic properties
of the coatings based on IPxH6 and HPxH6 decreased somewhat
(Table 2). In particular,
the coatings based on IP500H6 had the highest
pencil hardness of up to 2H and the highest pendulum hardness of up
to 146 ± 2 s; these results could be attributed to the higher
double-bond content supporting higher cross-linking densities in the
IP500H6 coating. The higher proportion of the
rigid group provided the coating with higher rigidity. In addition,
the coatings had superior gloss and adhesion. As the molecular weight
of PCDL increased, the soft segment of the oligomer became longer
and the rigidity of the chain decreased. At the same time, the increase
in the molecular weight caused a relative decrease in the content
of double bond and the cross-linking point density was lower and the
curried coating was softer. The coatings based on IPxH6 had the higher hardness compared with HPxH6 at the same molecular weight
of PCDL. The HPxH6 coating
had low hardness, and the higher the molecular weight of PCDL, the
lower the hardness is.

We further
conducted preliminary research for the properties of
the coatings based on IPxH6 on different substrates (Table S1) that
exhibited approximately the same trend.

2.5 Dynamic
Thermomechanical Analysis of Self-Healing
Coatings
Figure 7 shows the variation in the tan δ as a function of the
temperature for the IPxHy and HPxHy. The Tg values of the IPxHy and HPxHy are shown in Figure 7a,b. As the Mn of PCDL increased, the Tg value of the PU decreased. Regarding the coatings based on
IPxHy, Tg decreased from 64.4 to −2 °C,
and the Tg of HPxHy decreased from 15.5 to −28.2
°C. Increasing the molecular weight caused the Tg move to a lower temperature, which could be attributed
to the decrease in the content of hard domain in the polymer network.31,32 With the increase of the rigid structure of the polymer, the flexibility
of PU chains decreased, and thus Tg increased
with an increase in cyclotriphosphazene content. Because of the lower
molecular weight of PCDL500, it can be well dissolved,
be reacted with isocyanate to a higher degree, form an ideal polymer
network, and achieve a series of performances we expected.

the PU: (a) IPxHy; (b) HPxHy.

2.6 Thermal
Stability Characterization of the
Coatings
The thermal stabilities of the coatings based on
IPxHy and
HPxHy was
studied by thermal gravimetric analyzer measurements. From Figure 8, the thermal stability
of the series of self-healing coatings could be found. The temperature
of the coatings based on IP500H6, IP1000H6, IP2000H6, HP500H6 HP1000H6, and HP2000H6 5 wt % weight loss (T5%) were
261, 267, 273, 268, 269, and 259 °C, respectively, indicating
that all samples had good thermal resistance at the temperatures below
259 °C (Table S2). From the above
figure, we could not only see the thermal stability of the PU but
also see the decomposition process of the hard segments and soft segments.
PU chains consist of carbamate as a hard segment and polyols as a
soft segment.33 As we all know, compared
with the long carbon chain structure in the soft segment, the urethane
structure in the hard segment of the PU was more prone to be decomposed.
Therefore, the decomposition of urethane hard segments could be considered
as the first degradation section in afore mentioned oligomer; the
second stage was the decomposition of long fat chains in the soft
segment.34 A minor increase in T5% showed that the increase in the Mn of the PCDLs will increase the heat resistance of the
coatings. In addition, when the Mn of
the PCDLs was 500, the amount of char residue at 600 °C was highest
and the amount of residue decreased as the molecular weight increased.
This phenomenon was due to the cyclotriphosphazene that contains a
great deal of cyclic structures such as benzene rings to give it better
heat resistance.

2.7 Mechanical
Properties of Self-Healing Coatings
The mechanical properties
of the coatings based on IPxHy and HPxHy were investigated
through a tension test. From the Figure 9, we could see the stress–strain curves,
tensile strength, and elongation at break. The coatings based on IPxHy exhibited
superior mechanical properties to those based on HPxHy, especially at a molecular weight
(PCDL) of 500.

Figure 9 Stress and strain curves of the PU coatings: (a) IPxHy; (b) HPxHy. Tensile strength
(c) and elongation at break (d) of the two series of coatings based
on the PU (the X-axis represents the Mn of PCDLs in PU).

Regarding tensile strength, Figure 9c shows different results. The tensile strength
achieved
a maximum value of 24.33 ± 3.91 MPa at IP500H6, which then decreased at a lower molecular weight of PCDL.
The increasing rigidity of the chain was expected as the introduction
of more benzene ring structure in the PU, and more double bonds were
observed in the IP500H6 coatings to form a denser
cross-linked structures, provided stronger intermolecular interaction.
For the HPxHy series, the maximum tensile strength of 8.33 ± 0.87 MPa at
HP500H6 was obtained. The tensile strength decreased
with an increase in Mn in both of the
two series of coatings, and the elongation at break increased. Figure 9d shows that more
than 339% of the ultimate strain could be obtained for IP2000H6 because a high amount of elastomeric PCDL2000 was introduced into the systems. The introduction of a rigid structure
in the polymer would effectively increase the hardness and strength
of the coating; it would reduce the toughness of the coating due to
suppressed plastic deformation upon deformation and reduced elongation
at break.35,36 High soft segment content in the polymer
network improved the flexibility of the polymer.

3 Conclusion
In summary, we developed two series of UV-cured
self-healing coatings
based on PU with “hard core, flexible arm” structures.
On the basis of a comparison between the coatings based on IPxHy and HPxHy, both coatings
exhibited excellent repair effect, the soft arm provided mobility
in the chains, and reversible hydrogen bonding was used to achieve
repair performance. Although the coating based on IP500H6 had higher hardness, this can be attributed to the
rigid structure of the hard core and polymer networks formed by double
bonds, and thus the hardness decreased with an increase in the molecular
weight of PCDL. In addition, the coatings exhibited excellent thermal
stability. With an increase of molecular weight, the Tg modulus and strength greatly decreased, whereas elongation
at break increased relatively. These superior properties of the novel
polymers could be attributed to the unique “hard core, flexible
arm” structures.

Hexamethylene diisocyanate
(HDI) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) were provided by Dongrui
Chemical Materials Co., Ltd. (Wuxi). Asahi Kasei Corporation (Japan)
provided the PCDLs (molecular weight (Mn) = 2000, 1000, and 500 g/mol, named PCDL2000, PCDL1000, and PCDL500, respectively). Dibutyltin dilaurate
(DBTDL) and hydroquinone were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China);
Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd supplied the hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(HEMA); N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)

kindly obtained from QiangLi New-Material Stock Co., Ltd (Changzhou,
China); trifunctional acrylate (CD9051NS) was obtained from Sartomer
Co., Ltd; and the hexakis[p-(hydroxymethyl)phenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene
(H6) were synthesized according to the literature protocol.24−26

4.2 Synthesis of Monomer
4.2.1 Synthesis
of Hexakis[p-(aldehydephenoxy)phenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene
(HAPCP)
Refer to the method reported in the previous literature,24 the synthetic route of the HAPCP was seen in Scheme 1. First, the thermometer
and condenser were fitted onto a 250 mL three-necked flask and placed
in a magnetic stirrer. In the flask, parahydroxybenzaldehyde
(14.76 g, 0.12 mol), 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 20 mL of
triethylamine were placed; the temperature rose to 65 °C. Then,
dissolved phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (6.95 g, 0.02 mol) with
40 mL THF was added dropwise in a constant pressure drop funnel, stirred,
and refluxed for 24 h. Bright yellow solution was obtained by filtered,
and then the solvent was removed. Finally, the product was obtained
and washed three times with ethanol and recrystallized with ethyl
acetate, dried 12 h at a vacuum of 45 °C; pure white needle-like
solid products were obtained. Figure S1 presents the 1H NMR spectra of HAPCP.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of
the Monomer (HAPCP and H6)
4.2.2 Synthesis of H6
The
synthetic route of the H6 was as follows (Scheme 1). The HAPCP (4.31 g, 5.00
mmol), 30 mL of THF, and 15 mL of methanol were placed in a three-necked
flask and stirred for 30 min. Then, 2 g of sodium borohydride was
dispensed into the flask under an ice water bath and stirred for 24
h. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the product
was washed with deionized water, recrystallized from ethanol immediately
and finally dried at 45 °C to obtain the white product. Figure S2 presents the 1H NMR spectra
of H6.

4.3 Preparation of UV-Cured
Self-Healing PU
Scheme 2 shows the
synthesis of the self-healing PU. Two series of oligomers were prepared.
First, 3.36 g of HDI or 4.67 g of IPDI and catalyst DBTDL were placed
into a 250 mL four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer,
thermometer, and condenser. After the temperature rose to 50 °C,
0.01 mol of PCDL (Mn = 500, 1000, 2000
g/mol) was added dropwise in half an hour, and then the reaction was
stirred evenly at 50 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, dropwise added
1.30 g of HEMA was mixed with hydroquinone for 0.5 h under reflux
conditions and reacted with the previous product s for 3 h to form
the NCO-terminated prepolymer. Finally, the reaction was increased
to 70 °C and the H6 dissolved in DMF was added to
the flask for 7 h reaction until the reaction was complete. That is,
the characteristic peak of NCO (2267 cm–1) disappears
completely on the infrared spectrum (FTIR). The final oligomer was
named IPxHy or HPxHy. In IPxHy, and HPxHy, the first letter denotes the type of isocyanate (IPDI or HDI),
the “x” denotes the molecular weight
of PCDL, and the “y” denotes the type
of cyclotriphosphazene monomer.

4.4 Preparation
of UV-Cured Self-Healing Coatings
The aluminum plate was
cleaned with acetone before being used as
the coating substrate. IPxHy or HPxHy was used as the matrix resin and Irgacure 184 (3
wt %) as the photoinitiator, mixed with trifunctional acrylate (CD9051NS,
2 wt %) to prepare UV-cured coating. A 120-thick wet film was daubed
to the substrate with the doctor blade. The wet film was prebaked
at room temperature for 2 h and immediately placed on a hot plate
until the solvent was completely removed. Finally, each sample was
cured under F300 UVA lamp (the light intensity measured by the German-designed
UV INT 140 was 120 mW/cm2) for 60 s to obtain a series
of cured coatings.

4.5 Characterizations of UV-Cured
Self-Healing
PU and Coatings
The AVANCE III HD 400 MHz (Bruker) was used
to measure the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR)
of IPxHy or
HPxHy. The
samples to be tested were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and tested
as tetramethylsilane internal standard at four temperatures (25, 50,
75, and 100 °C). A Thermo Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer was
used to measure FTIR spectra of IPxHy or HPxHy. The wavenumber ranges from 500 to 4000
cm–1. The molecular weight of the polymer was determined
by gel permeation chromatograph (the eluent: THF, flow rate: 1.0 mL/min).
The rheological properties of the polymer were investigated by DHR-2
Discovery rheometer (TA Instruments). All samples were measured in
parallel plate system dynamic mode (angular frequency ranging: 0.01–200
rad/s, plate diameters: 25 mm). A 120 μm thick coating was coated
on the substrate, measuring its gloss at 60° reflective angle.
The hardness of the pendulum was measured with PH-5858, BYK, Germany,
using the ASTM D 4366 test mode, in seconds as the hardness unit.
According to the standard crosshatch adhesion test (ASTM D 3359),
the adhesion of coatings was tested (QFH, Tianjin Jingke Material
Testing Co. Ltd.). The atomic force microscope (AFM MuLtimode) from
the Bruker Company was used to observe self-healing properties of
coatings; first, the surface of the coating was scratched with a scalpel,
followed by heat treatment of the damaged surface with a heat gun,
and the performance before and after the coating damage was taken
by AFM (hot air gun was 5 cm away from the surface, heating time was
1 min, temperature was 180 °C). Using ultra-deep-field 3D microscope
(KH-8700; Hirox) from the Keyence Company, the self-healing performance
in different healing times was observed. The healing process was carried
out at 100 °C on a hot plate (SET) from Shenzhen Fan and hang
Co. Ltd. Thermal stability were characterized using the TGA 1100SF
instrument by heating the samples from 30 to 600 °C; the heating
rate was 20 °C/min. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was measured
by the DMA Q800 (TA Instruments). Temperature range was from −50
to 140 °C, heating rate was 3 °C/min, and test frequency
was 1 Hz. The tensile tests results were examined by the Instron 5967
at the room temperature; the average stretching rate was 20 mm/min
(six samples were 15 mm in length and 4 mm in thickness).
