Nowadays, the efficient, stable,
and scalable conversion of solar
energy into chemical fuels represents a great scientific, economic,
and ethical challenge. Amongst the available candidate technologies,
photoelectrochemical water-splitting potentially has the most promising
technoeconomic trade-off between cost and efficiency. However, research
on semiconductors and photoelectrode architectures suitable for H2 evolution has focused mainly on the use of fabrication techniques
and inorganic materials that are not easily scalable. Here, we report
for the first time an all solution-processed approach for the fabrication
of hybrid organic/inorganic photocathodes based on organic semiconductor
bulk heterojunctions that exhibit promising photoelectrochemical performance.
The sequential deposition of inorganic material, charge-selective
contacts, visible-light sensitive organic polymers, and earth-abundant,
nonprecious catalyst by spin coating leads to state-of-the-art photoelectrochemical
parameters, comprising a high onset potential [+0.602 V vs reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and a positive maximum power point (+0.222
V vs RHE), a photocurrent density as high as 5.25 mA/cm2 at 0 V versus RHE, an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
at 0 V versus RHE of above 35%, and 100% faradaic efficiency for hydrogen
production. The demonstrated all solution-processed hybrid photoelectrodes
represent an eligible candidate for the scalable and low-cost solar-to-H2 conversion technology that embodies the feasibility requirements
for large area, plant-scale applications.

1 Introduction
Organic
semiconductors have attracted considerable interest in
cost-effective electricity generation using third-generation photovoltaics
(PVs).1,2 Recently, a power conversion efficiency
of over 10% has been achieved by the most efficient conjugated polymer
semiconductors in state-of-the-art organic PV cells.3 One of the main advantages of polymer semiconductors is
their compatibility with flexible devices, as well as with solution-processed,
large area deposition techniques.4 In contrast
with the PV field, exploitation of the optoelectronic properties of
conjugated polymers for photoelectrochemical applications has been
scarcely considered.5−10 It is only very recently that polymer-based devices for photoelectrochemical
hydrogen production have been reported by a few groups.11−14 By taking advantage of scientific know-how, large material availability,
and technological solutions that have already been developed in the
organic PV field, efficient organic photocathodes have been demonstrated,15,16 reaching, in some cases, performances comparable with their inorganic
counterparts.17,18 Typically, hybrid organic/inorganic
architectures have been employed, composed of electron donor/acceptor
organic materials in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture, working
as light absorbing and charge generating materials, sandwiched in
between inorganic charge-selective layers.14,16−19 The benchmark architecture for hybrid organic/inorganic photoelectrochemical
(HOPEC) devices reported so far comprises an organic BHJ (namely,
the electron donor regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)
blended with the electron acceptor fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl
C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (P3HT:PCBM)) sandwiched in between
a hole-selective layer (HSL), γ-cuprous iodide (CuI), and an
electron-selective layer (ESL), amorphous TiO2, deposited
by pulsed laser deposition and covered by a sputtered layer of Pt.20 The CuI layer, deposited by spin coating, proved
to be very efficient when working as the HSL,21−24 permitting a photocurrent density
as high as 8 mA/cm2 at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) to be achieved.20

Although
these results demonstrate that HOPEC devices represent
a promising, alternative approach with respect to more established
inorganic photoelectrochemical systems,25,26 their greater
potential advantage could be their use in printing for the low-cost
fabrication of large area devices. To achieve this, a fully solution-processed
architecture is needed. Only very few examples of organic, all solution-processed
photocathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been reported
so far in the literature.27 In the most
relevant example, a maximum photocurrent density of 2 mA/cm2 at 0 V versus RHE was achieved, using MoOx as the HSL and molybdenum trisulfide (MoS3) as a catalyst,
on top of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ.28

Thus,
the production of a hybrid organic/inorganic photocathode
entirely by solution-processed techniques represents a milestone toward
device scalability, low cost, fast fabrication, and high-throughput
industrial implementation. In parallel, the use of earth-abundant
catalysts that are able to replace precious metals and are compatible
with solution processing should be considered as well.

Here,
our objective is the realization of an all solution-processed
photocathode that exhibits competitive performance with respect to
previously reported hybrid architectures. In view of this, we develop
a low-cost technology compatible with the use of environmentally sustainable
catalysts and allowing for easy scale-up of device surface area. We
report hybrid organic/inorganic photocathodes that are entirely realized
by spin coating in air, using commercial fluorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO) as the substrate. These devices show interesting performances
in terms of photocurrent generation and achieve the production of
hydrogen with near unity faradaic efficiency.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the optimized architecture of the all solution-processed photocathode,
namely, FTO/CuI/BHJ/TiO2/catalyst/PEI. In this case, Pt
and branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) were used as the HER catalyst
and organic protective layer, respectively. The CuI, P3HT:PCBM BHJ,
and PEI layers were realized as previously reported.20

dashed line) are also shown. (c) UV–visible transmission spectra
of the all solution-processed photocathode with Pt catalyst (red)
and the same stack fabricated omitting the Pt deposition step (black).

In agreement with recent studies,20 the
very thin layer of CuI (thickness <10 nm) enables a very efficient
hole collection process, thanks to the good match with the P3HT highest
occupied molecular orbital level (Figure 1b) and the electronically favorable and thermodynamically
stable crystalline character. The presence of a crystalline γ-phase
of CuI (Figure S1) is confirmed by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figure S1). The average grain size is 17.4 ± 2.2 nm, as derived from
Scherrer peak analysis. A favorable work function (WF) value of CuI,
equal to 4.87 ± 0.1 eV, was obtained by ambient Kelvin probe
measurements (see Table S1, reporting also
the WF values measured for all of the inorganic materials employed
in the present photocathode architecture), which is in line with literature
values.23,24

During the photoelectrochemical experiments,
the photocathodes
were illuminated through the FTO–glass substrate. However,
even in the presence of the catalyst layer, they display a semitransparent
character, as documented by the transmittance spectra (Figure 1c), thus making irradiation
possible from both directions. This is a pivotal requirement for the
integration of a photocathode with photoanodes in a tandem configuration.
The transmission spectrum is mainly dominated by the P3HT absorption
band, peaking in the green part of the visible range, at around 500
nm. As documented elsewhere for the P3HT:PCBM BHJ,29 and in agreement with our previous reports,19,20,30 a photoactive layer of around
200 nm in thickness was found to be appropriate for optimal light
absorption under simulated illumination at 1 sun intensity.

The deposition of the upper layer on top of the organic BHJ is
particularly challenging by solution-processed methods. So far, solution-processed
TiO2 fabricated in this way has been scarcely reported
as an electron-selective material in photocathode architectures. The
most common approach is based on substoichiometric titania nanoparticles
dispersed in an organic phase (TiO2(org)).13 However, in our case, this strategy did not yield significant
performances, even in the presence of a Pt-based catalyst (Figure S2). Thus, we opted for a completely different
approach. According to Yun et al.,31 TiO2 nanoparticles exhibiting the anatase crystalline phase can
be obtained by a low temperature sol–gel method in aqueous
media (aq). This synthesis was reproduced here with minor modifications
(see Section 4). Crystalline
TiO2 in the anatase phase was confirmed by XRD measurements,
showing a grain size of 5.6 ± 2.2 nm as derived from Scherrer
peak analysis (Figure 2).

Figure 2 ESL layer structural analysis. XRD pattern (blue solid line) of
a TiO2(aq) thin film spin coated over a glass substrate.
Reference reflections of anatase TiO2 (black solid lines)
are also shown for comparison.

The TiO2(aq) WF is 4.71 ± 0.01 eV, as measured
by Kelvin probe analysis (see Table S1).
Both the good energetic match with the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital level of the PCBM donor (Figure 1b) and the crystalline morphology are expected
to enhance the device photoelectrochemical performance by maximizing
electron transfer at the interface and by favoring electronic transport
within the layer, respectively. However, the aqueous nature of the
TiO2(aq) dispersion can cause significant wettability issues
during film formation, due to the incompatible polarity of the underlying
organic surface. One fast
and efficient way to circumvent such an issue is to modify the surface
energy at the interface by applying an oxygen plasma treatment. As
the BHJ surface will be exposed to interactions with plasma particles
and energy fluxes, care has to be taken to avoid thermal, ballistic,
and oxidative damage to the polymer blend. A short and low radio frequency
power density surface plasma treatment performed in a pure O2 atmosphere (hereafter denoted by “plasma 1”, 30 s
at 60 W power) was thus applied to the BHJ surface, whilst keeping
the sample floating at the plasma potential by means of a nonconductive
substrate holder. The plasma treatment resulted in enhanced wettability
and allowed the formation of a more homogeneous TiO2(aq) layer (100–120 nm thick, Figure 1a). Overall, the replacement of TiO2(org) with TiO2(aq) as the ESL turned out to be highly beneficial,
leading to a significant improvement in the photocurrent value (0.8
mA/cm2 at 0 V vs RHE, see Figure S2).

Further efforts toward the realization of efficient photocathodes
for hydrogen production have focused on more careful control of the
hydrolysis process of the titania layer in air, which is considered
an important step in TiOx to TiO2 conversion. We varied the hydrolysis time in air from 10 min up
to 3 days, finding a treatment time of 24 h to be the optimum time.
Afterward, thermal annealing under an inert atmosphere at 130 °C
for 10 min was applied. A Pt catalyst ink was employed (see below
for a direct comparison of the effect of different catalysts), leading
to clusters of catalyst particles dispersed over the TiO2 surface (see Figures 1a and S3). A thin PEI layer was finally
added on top. The latter, according to previous results, is expected
to improve the device lifetime by limiting catalyst detachment over
time, without affecting photocurrent generation.20 Notably, these optimized conditions allowed the achievement
of photocurrents surpassing 1 mA/cm2 at 0 V versus RHE
(Figure 3, blue solid
line).

Figure 3 Photoelectrochemical characterization. Current–potential
characteristics measured in 0.1 M H2SO4–Na2SO4 solution at pH 1.0, under chopped (dashed line)
and continuous (full line) AM 1.5 G light illumination (100 W/cm2) for two different all solution-processed photocathode fabrication
strategies. The TiO2(aq) deposition step was followed by
O2 plasma treatment in one case (red curve), but not in
the other one (blue curve). In both cases, the complete device architecture
was FTO/CuI/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2(aq)/Pt/PEI.

Another critical element in the fabrication of efficient
and reliable
photocathodes is the interface between the ESL and the catalyst layer,
where the presence of defects may easily lead to electron recombination
losses. We found that a second oxygen plasma treatment (using the
same parameters as those of the former one, hereafter denoted as “plasma
2”), in this case on the TiO2(aq) surface prior
to catalyst deposition, is of key importance and leads to a further,
substantial enhancement in the photocurrent of about +400%. A record
photocurrent value of 5.25 mA/cm2 at 0 V versus RHE and
an average value of 4.60 ± 0.39 mA/cm2 at 0 V versus
RHE (mean values ± SD calculated over six measurements, n = 6) were achieved. The introduction of the additional
plasma treatment also leads to higher onset potential values (+0.60
± 0.01 V vs RHE), as compared to the 0.46 ± 0.01 V versus
RHE onset potential measured for the photoelectrode fabricated without
the second plasma treatment step. A significant improvement in the
fill factor shape of the JV curves is also obtained,
characterized by a maximum power point (Vmpp) of +0.22 ± 0.01 V versus RHE and providing a photocurrent
of 3.02 ± 0.09 mA/cm2. Moreover, one should note that
transient capacitive peaks are completely suppressed upon introduction
of the second plasma treatment in the fabrication protocol, thus confirming
the improvement of electron transfer processes at the TiO2(aq)/catalyst interface. Overall, these features represent, to the best
of our knowledge, state-of-the-art performance for a photocathode
entirely fabricated by all solution-processed techniques.

Additional
photoelectrochemical characterization of the solution-processed
photocathodes was focused on relevant efficiency-based features. The
incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) value at 0
V versus RHE is higher than 35% around 500 nm (Figure 4a), where the maximum absorption of the photoactive
BHJ layer occurs (Figure 1c). This indicates that more than one-third of the photons
arriving at the photocathode are converted into electrons that are
capable of driving HER at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Importantly,
the integrated photocurrent (4.90 mA/cm2, blue line) extracted
from the IPCE data shows a good match with photocurrent values measured
by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 0 V versus RHE. Hydrogen evolution
was directly measured by gas chromatography (GC) during a potentiostatic
chronoamperometry (CA) scan at fixed potential (0 V vs RHE). The results
show that after an initial transient behavior, ascribed to a delay
in gas equilibration across the measurement cell, the faradaic efficiency
is 100%, and this is maintained over 2 h (Figure 4b). This indicates that all of the electrons
extracted at the catalyst/electrolyte interface are consumed by the
H+/H2 half-reaction.

parameters and product analysis.

photocathodes (left axis, black circles) and integration of the IPCE

(b) Faradaic efficiency, calculated as the ratio between the measured
and the expected hydrogen content, is shown as red symbols. H2 evolution was monitored by GC during continuous photocathode
operation under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 100 W/cm2) in the electrolyte solution (0.1 M H2SO4–Na2SO4 at pH 1.0).

The photoelectrochemical performance of the all solution-processed
device is comparable when using either water dispersions of commercial
platinum (Pt) nanopowder or other widely reported catalyst layer synthesis
strategies such as an isopropanol solution of platinum on graphitized-carbon
powder (VC-Pt; Vulcan) (Figure 5, red and blue solid lines, respectively). However, the need
to reduce the use of precious materials prompted us to develop architectures
based on earth-abundant catalysts. MoS3 has been reported
as a good HER catalyst with a low overpotential,11,16 and represents a viable option toward the realization of low-cost
hydrogen production systems. A dispersion of commercial MoS3 powder in water/acetone (1:2 v/v) was deposited by spin coating
on top of the plasma-treated TiO2 surface, without any
further postprocessing treatment. The photoelectrochemical response
of the FTO/CuI/BHJ/TiO2/MoS3 photocathode is
comparable with those of the photocathodes obtained with Pt-based
catalysts (Figure 5). The average photocurrent (measured at 0 V vs RHE) and onset potential
values are 3.94 ± 0.13 mA/cm2 and 0.57 ± 0.05
V versus RHE, respectively. Similar to the Pt-based catalyst, MoS3 tends to form clusters of amorphous particles dispersed on
top of the TiO2 surface rather than a conformal layer (Figures S1 and S3). Importantly, optical absorption
spectra show that the MoS3 catalyst layer does not affect
light transmission across the device (Figure S4).

with different electrocatalyst layers. Current–potential characteristics
of different all solution-processed photocathode architectures (FTO/CuI/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2/catalyst) measured at pH 1 under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination
(dashed lines for chopped illumination, solid lines for continuous
illumination) using platinum nanopowder (Pt), VC-Pt, and Pt-free catalyst
(MoS3).

A practical indicator
for the evaluation of photoelectrode performance
is the ideal ratiometric power-saved figure of merit, Φsaved,ideal.32 In the case of HER
driven by a photocathode at Vmpp under
solar power input Ps = 100 mW/cm2, with respect to an ideally nonpolarizable dark electrode (i.e.,
the RHE, with VRHE = 0 at any current),
Φsaved,ideal is defined as  Hence, it provides information about the ability
of a photocathode to achieve H2 evolution at potentials
that are more positive than the thermodynamic potential of H+/H2. For the Pt case (Jmpp = 3.02 mA/cm2 and Vmpp =
+0.22 V vs RHE), we obtain Φsaved,ideal = 0.67%,
whereas in the case of MoS3 (Jmpp = 2.18 mA/cm2 and Vmpp =
+0.17 V vs RHE), Φsaved,ideal = 0.38%. The difference
comes from the larger HER overpotential exhibited by the latter catalyst,
and could also be affected by a poorer alignment between the respective
Fermi levels at the TiO2/MoS3 interface (Table S1).

Lastly, the temporal behavior
of a photocathode is an important
aspect to consider for the long-lasting exploitation of devices. We
should recall that previous studies have shown that conjugated polymers,
and in particular P3HT, preserve their optoelectronic properties when
in contact with aqueous electrolytes.33,34 In addition,
we have recently demonstrated that a thin PEI coating on top of a
conformal layer of Pt catalyst helps to prevent catalyst delamination
during photocathode operation and possibly limits, to some extent,
electrolyte permeation toward the inner layers, thus overall improving
the photocurrent stability.20 Here, we
tested the same approach with the all solution-processed Pt-based
photocathode. The introduction of a protective coating leads to a
significant improvement in photocurrent stability. The PEI-capped
devices provide 3 mA/cm2 even after 40 min of continuous
operation, in contrast to less than 500 μA/cm2 for
the uncovered Pt photocathode (Figure S5). Overall, an extended performance is obtained (reaching 1 mA/cm2 after 100 min of operation) with respect to the uncapped
device. This can be ascribed to the chelating properties of PEI to
metallic ions35,36 and metals.37 The MoS3-based device was intrinsically more
stable with respect to the uncoated Pt-based one, showing about 2
mA/cm2 after 40 min of continuous operation (Figure S5). Unfortunately, a detrimental effect
on photocurrent stability was observed in the PEI-capped MoS3 devices. Elucidation of the detailed reasons for such an unexpected
detrimental effect is currently ongoing. In general, optimization
of the stability properties of hybrid devices will require deeper
and more careful optimization of the interfaces between the organic
and the inorganic layers, especially under harsh electrolytic environments
such as strong acids.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we demonstrate that a fast fabrication technique,
entirely based on solution processing, can be employed for the realization
of low-cost photocathodes. To the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art
performances for polymer-based photocathodes have been reported here,
showing photoelectrochemical parameters that are comparable with other
all solution-processed devices making use of inorganic semiconductors,
such as CuInS2.38 This has been
made possible by the combination of different key steps, including
the use of anatase phase TiO2(aq) as the ESL, which avoids
the use of high temperatures; careful optimization of the BHJ/TiO2 and TiO2/catalyst interfaces, which have a critical
impact on device performance; and the development of techniques that
are fully compatible with the use of earth-abundant catalysts.

Our method contributes to advancing the development of laboratory
prototypes into large area, light and flexible systems for hydrogen
production, employing the same techniques and fabrication facilities
already developed in the field of printed organic PVs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Photocathode
Fabrication
Photocathodes were fabricated on commercial FTO.
Substrates were
cleaned by subsequent ultrasonic baths with a series of solvents.
CuI (Sigma-Aldrich; 97% purity) was dissolved in acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich,
American Chemical Society (ACS) grade) at 10 g/L concentration. CuI
deposition was carried out by spin coating in one single step (3000
rpm rotation speed for 60 s). rr-P3HT (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification, molecular weight (MW) 15 000–45 000,
purity 99.995%) and fullerene derivative PCBM (purchased from Nano-C,
Inc.) were individually dissolved in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich;
ACS grade) and then mixed at a 1:1 wt ratio and at 25 g/L on a polymer
basis. The blend solution was stirred overnight at 50 °C. The
active layer was spin coated on top of the CuI layer in a two-step
process (800 rpm for 3 s, followed by 1600 rpm for 60 s).

Organic-based
TiOx nanoparticles were synthesized according
to ref (13).

Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP 97%; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved
in a mixture of ethanol/isopropanol (5:5 mL) to provide a concentration
of 0.05 mol/L. Then, concentrated HCl was added as the acid catalyst
to provide a water to TTIP molar ratio of 0.82. The precursor solution
was stirred for 72 h at room temperature in a sealed vial. This sol
was spin coated on top of the BHJ surface at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Aqueous-based
TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to a modified
sol–gel protocol31 that comprises
a mixture of titanium TTIP (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol and water
to obtain a TTIP/ethanol/water molar ratio of 1:0.75:83. Then, 1 mL
of concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of concentrated nitric acid
was added as the acid catalyst and the resulting sol was refluxed
under vigorous stirring for 8 h at 80 °C, finally reaching a
stable milky dispersion of TiOx nanoparticles
at 15% concentration in weight under a Ti-basis. A 30 s low power
(60 W) oxygen plasma treatment (plasma 1) was applied to the surface
of the BHJ to enhance the wettability of the aqueous-based titania
dispersion. A three-step spin coating protocol was employed comprising
3 s at 200 rpm, 60 s at 1000 rpm, and 30 s at 5000 rpm. Afterward,
thermal annealing under an inert atmosphere at 130 °C for 10
min was applied followed by a plasma treatment like before (plasma
2) just prior to catalyst deposition.

Commercial platinum nanopowder
(Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in
water at 1 g/L concentration in weight and sonicated for 30 min. The
commercial catalyst Vulcan XC-72 (20% loading VC-Pt; Sigma-Aldrich)
was dissolved in isopropanol at 1 g/L concentration in weight and
sonicated for 30 min. Commercial MoS3 powder (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.) was dissolved in a water/acetone mixture at a volume
ratio of 1:2 in the presence of 1 M NaOH to a mass concentration of
3.8 g/L. The dispersion was stirred at 70 °C for 2 h and then
sonicated for 30 min. The three catalyst dispersions were spin coated
at 2000 rpm for 60 s each. Branched PEI (MW 25 000 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich)
was dissolved in ethanol at 0.1% concentration and spin coated on
top of the full devices at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Further details on material
preparation can be found in the Supporting Information section.

4.2 Material Characterization
Techniques
UV–visible transmittance was collected
using a PerkinElmer
LAMBDA 1050 spectrophotometer. An α-Step IQ surface profilometer
was used to measure the thickness of the BHJ film. Thickness was also
confirmed by SEM cross-sectional measurements using a Zeiss Supra
40 field-emission SEM instrument under an operating voltage of 5 kV
and a working distance of 2 mm. WF data were obtained using a commercial
Kelvin probe system (KPSP020; KP Technologies Inc.). Samples were
measured in air and at room temperature and both a clean gold surface
(WF = 4.8 eV) and a graphite sample (highly ordered pyrolytic graphite,
WF = 4.6 eV) were used as independent references for the probe potential.
X-ray powder diffraction experiments were carried out on a Bruker
D8 Advance diffractometer operating in 2θ configuration for
thin film analysis with Ge-monochromated Cu KR1 radiation (λ
= 1.5406 Å) and a linear position-sensitive detector, with a
2θ range of 20–80° and a step size of 0.015°.
Crystalline grain size was derived through Scherrer’s formula
from the anatase {101} crystalline peak. Error bars in crystallite
grain size and crystalline volume fraction data-points were derived
by error propagation of standard deviations of XRD peak full width
at half-maximum (FWHM) values and areas derived by XRD pattern fitting.

4.3 Photoelectrochemical Measurements
Photoelectrochemical
measurements were carried out at room temperature
in a flat-bottom fused silica cell under a three-electrode configuration
using an Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat/galvanostat station, equipped
with the Nova 1.8 (Metrohm) software package. A Pt wire was used as
the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl, saturated with KCl, was used as
the reference electrode. Measurements were performed in 50 mL of an
aqueous solution of 0.1 M H2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.999% purity)/0.1 M Na2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich,
purity 99.0%) at pH 1.0. Oxygen was purged from testing electrolyte
solutions by continuously flowing nitrogen gas throughout the liquid
volume using a porous frit for at least 30 min before starting measurements.
A constant, slight nitrogen flow was maintained afterward for the
whole duration of the experiments, to avoid redissolution of molecular
oxygen into the electrolyte. Potential differences between the working
electrode and the reference electrode were reported with respect to
the RHE scale using the Nernst equation. A 300 W Xenon light source
(model LS0306; LOT-QuantumDesign Ltd.), equipped with AM 1.5 G filters,
was used to simulate solar illumination conditions at the glass substrate
side of the samples inside the test cell.

LSV was employed to
evaluate the response of the devices in the dark and under chopped
illumination. Voltage was swept starting above the open circuit potential
of the electrochemical cell toward cathodic potentials below 0 V versus
RHE at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Stability tests were performed by running
potentiostatic CA at 0 V versus RHE, under continuous illumination,
and monitoring dark current values from time to time.

For analysis
of the evolved gas products, the hybrid photocathode
was fixed inside a gas-tight test cell with a quartz window and illuminated
from the glass substrate side by a 450 W xenon lamp (ozone-free; Osram),
equipped with a KG3 filter (LOT-QuantumDesign Ltd.) and calibrated
to 1 sun illumination intensity by a Si photodiode. Measurements were
conducted by running CA measurements in three-electrode configuration
at 0 V versus RHE at pH 1 while maintaining rapid magnetic stirring.
Helium gas at 20 mL/min flow was continuously bubbled through the
cell with the out-flow periodically injected into a GC (TRACE Ultra
with a pulsed discharge detector; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; ShinCarbon
ST column; Restek) for in-line characterization of evolved hydrogen.
The Pt wire counter electrode was held behind a porous ceramic frit
to minimize product crossover. The GC response was calibrated within
the same cell and gas flow conditions using a dedicated Pt wire under
galvanostatic hydrogen evolution at known rates.

IPCE measurements
were performed using a 300 W xenon lamp (Cermax
PE 300 BUV) light source and a monochromator (FWHM 10 nm; Bausch &
Lomb) between 350 and 700 nm. The photocathode was fixed inside a
test cell equipped with a quartz window and illuminated from the glass
substrate side using a shadow mask with 0.64 cm2 aperture.
The photocurrent response data were collected by running CA measurements
in three-electrode configuration at 0 V versus RHE and at pH 1, and
were further normalized against a calibrated silicon photodiode (FDS-100;
