In this study, the potential of conversion-type
anode materials
for alkali-ion batteries has been examined and analyzed in terms of
the parameters of prime importance for practical alkali-ion systems.
Issues like voltage hysteresis, discharge profile, rate stabilities,
cyclic stabilities, irreversible capacity loss, and Columbic efficiencies
have been specifically addressed and analyzed as the key subjects.
Relevant studies on achieving a better performance by addressing one
or more of the issues have been carefully selected and outlook has
been presented on the basis of this literature. Mechanistic insights
into the subject of conversion reactions are discussed in light of
the use of recent and advanced techniques like in situ transmission
electron microscopy, in operando X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption
spectroscopy. Three-dimensional plots depicting the performance of
different materials, morphologies, and compositions with respect to
these parameters are also presented to highlight the systematic of
multiparameter dependencies. Inferences are drawn from these plots
in the form of a short section at the end, which should be helpful
to the readers, especially young researchers. We believe that this
study differs from others on the subject in being focused toward addressing
the practical limitations and providing possible research directions
to achieve the best possible results from conversion-type anode materials.

Introduction
Conversion materials are being researched
in parallel to alloying
and intercalation materials as possible ideal anodes for future alkali-ion
batteries.1 The simple conversion electrochemistry
of transition-metal oxides (TMOs), sulfides, phosphides, and similar
compounds of p-block metalloids shares some interesting and useful
electrochemical features with other anode materials.2 As already well understood, different types of anode electrochemistries
that qualify the required norms set for the said application, namely,
the operating potential versus Li/Na <2, are categorized as intercalation,
alloying, and conversion types. Figure 1 plots all of the set of available anode categories
with respect to this defining parameter along X axis
and another primary quantitative parameter i.e., capacity, along the Y axis.3 Although intercalation
and alloying materials have received the preferred focus, conversion
materials have thus far been left out for any type of practical industrial
applications owing to certain specific shortcomings.4

Figure 1 Different Li- and Na-ion battery anode systems listed on the basis
of the reaction potential and specific capacities.

This category of materials lacks seriously in terms
of cyclic stability,
flat charge–discharge behavior, round-trip energy efficiency,
and desirable operating voltages with respect to Li and Na. In this
article, we analyze various conversion chemistries with regard to
these parameters and attempt to provide an outlook based on the work
that has addressed some of these specific issues.

We first compare
the performance of these material types with the
other anode types that have shown commercial promise i.e., alloying
and intercalation. Table 1 portrays the comparison in the best possible way by considering
the performance parameters of real importance for both Li and Na cases.
Among conversion materials, the operating potentials show considerable
variation, which is mostly guided by the transition metal (TM) and
counteranion. The operating potential is also seen to considerably
differ for the Na and Li cases. Figure 2 depicts these observations in a more systematic way.
Despite these unresolved issues on the practical front in the present
form, a lot of high-impact papers are still being constantly published
pertaining to their use as anodes in Li- and Na-ion batteries in view
of the specific positive aspects mentioned above, and efforts are
on to make them industrially attractive and viable with a variety
of strategies.5

Mechanistic Insights into the Conversion
Mechanism
For the broad class of conversion materials, the
conversion redox
reactions ultimately result in the formation of the metallic phase,
as depicted in Scheme 1. The presence of metallic and alkali oxide phases has been probed
by different characterization techniques.16 Indeed, in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) have revealed interesting stages of lithiation and sodiation
during the course of the overall conversion.17,18 The formation of multiple phases at different stages of lithiation
and sodiation has been tracked by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
and other in operando techniques.19−21 In situ imaging techniques
have further enhanced the level of our understanding and have revealed
that the conversion reactions are associated with the breakdown of
long-range crystalline order.22 Thus, lithiation
and sodiation invariably involve breakdown of single-crystalline parent material to polycrystalline metallic
particles dispersed in amorphous alkali oxide matrix. Electron energy
loss spectroscopy analysis of some conversion materials has revealed
that the back conversions are incomplete and thus could be mainly
responsible for inconsistent cycling capacity.

in Conversion-Type Anodes
Problems Associated with Conversion Materials
The major
issues that need to be addressed if the conversion materials are to
invoke a potential commercialization claim are voltage hysteresis,
long sloping regions in discharge profile (voltage-dependent redox
reaction), inconsistent cycling stability, rate instability, and higher
first-cycle capacity loss.23Figures 3 and 4 portray some of these issues based on some relevant literature reports.
Before going into the full analysis and possible ways out, we present
a brief discussion about each of these.

Figure 3 Various issues associated
with conversion materials through relevant
data from the literature: (a) Voltage hysteresis and its various components.24 (b, c) Inconsistent cycling behavior {drastic
decrease (CuCo2O4 nanowalls) and continuous
increase (mixed MnCoOx)} observed in conversion materials.25,26 (d) Intermittency of sloping and small plateau regions in the discharge
profile (graphene/Co3O4).27 (e) Larger irreversible capacity loss and attendant initial
low Columbic efficiency in Fe2O3 conversion
material.25 (f) Drastic decrease in capacity
of conversion materials compared to alloying materials28 (reprinted with permission from refs (24−27), and (28)).

Figure 4 Graphical representation of comparison of issues
associated with
conversion materials with different reported morphologies and compositions:
(a) voltage hysteresis, (b) percentage capacity contribution from
plateau region, and (c) irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle.

Voltage Hysteresis
A major factor that hinders the
practical application of conversion anodes is the low round-trip energy
efficiency due to the voltage hysteresis between the charging and
discharging profiles, i.e., charging occurs at a higher voltage compared
to discharging, indicating that the amount of energy retrieved back
is less than the energy stored in each cycle.1Figure 3a presents
the voltage–capacity profile showing the voltage hysteresis
in conversion anodes. Different reasons have been proposed for the
drastic difference in the charging and discharging potentials.24,29 Although there has been a large volume of research on this subject,
the origin of the voltage hysteresis in conversion anodes is still
not clearly understood. The first and most obvious reason for the
existence of voltage hysteresis lies in the conversion process itself.
The lithiation-mediated conversion to metallic phase and amorphous
alkali oxides does possess a lower activation barrier than the back
conversion to single-phase parent material from these two evenly distributed
phases. Thus, electronegativities of the anions holding Li play a
critical role. Indeed, some preliminary studies by Oumellal et al.
have revealed that oxides show higher hysteresis and hydrides show
the least.30 The voltage hysteresis has
other contributions; notable among them is the contribution from electronic
conductivity of the material. As the lithiation-mediated phase breakdown
generates nonconducting alkali compounds, the iR drop
related to hysteresis will also be invariably present. In addition
to this, the voltage hysteresis contributions from the solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) layer and the surface stresses also contribute significantly.31

However, the lack of a more detailed research
in this context has limited our understanding of the exact origin
of the voltage hysteresis in conversion anodes. Further, the relative
contributions from the different underlying factors also need to be
ascertained through a more fundamental research.

Inconsistent
Cycling Stability
Another important issue
that has been associated with conversion materials is the inconsistent
cycling performance. Figure 3b,c shows two observations in this respect from the relevant
literature.25,26 Both the huge capacity fading
and the constant increase in capacity have been observed for some
initial cycles. Although the exact mechanism behind the capacity fading
is unexplored in any significant details, the phase conversion followed
by aggregation of the metallic domains may be cited as the underlying
reason for the long-term cyclic instability.32 The gradual increase in the size of metallic particles upon cycling
may decrease the kinetic availability of the material for Li storage.
This can consequently lead to massive capacity fading with cycling.
Although some theoretical studies have been directed toward understanding
this, there is a lack of enough experimental research in this respect.
These theoretical studies have hinted that the small irreversibility
inherently associated with the conversion process at individual steps
ultimately leads to cyclic failures.33 The
first-principle calculations on Co3O4 and NiO
reveal that the reaction proceeds by insertion mechanism until the
incorporation of three Li per formula unit and can be cycled completely
if the Li insertion is restricted to this value. But the inclusion
of further Li leads to actual conversion and hence capacity fading
upon cycling can be related to this basic conversion process. Additionally,
the reversible growth of a polymeric gel-like film that grows on the
surface of electrolyte decomposition on progressively crumbled anode
particles can further add to the problem.34 In the case of sulfide materials, additional cyclic instabilities
are induced owing to polysulfide dissolution.35

As far as the capacity increase upon cycling for some conversion
oxides, sulfides, and selenides36,37 is concerned, the lithiation-based
reactivation can be cited as a possible reason. Again, no conclusive
work exists in the literature that can be cited as the exact reason
behind these observations. However, the findings have been partly
attributed to a slow release of Li+ that gets trapped in
amorphous Li2R (R = O, S, P, H, Se) during the first conversion.
Incomplete first conversion due to the formation of isolated islands
in amorphous matrix can participate in subsequent cycles by generation
of new ionic and electronic connections therein.38

To address the capacity fade because of the formation
of larger
metallic domains that in turn make the material kinetically unavailable
for the rest of cycles, prior addition of excess metallic grains can
help solve the issues.39 The extra metallic
sites can act as fresh reaction sites during the charging and can
compensate for the unavailable metal for the rest of the reaction.
However, the lack of proper understanding in this respect has hindered
the progress of research for resolving the issue.

Sloping Regions
in Charge–Discharge Profile
One of the major hurdles
for the conversion materials is the sloping
region in the charge–discharge profiles. The sloping charge–discharge
voltage profiles in electrochemical terms imply that the charge storage
and delivery occur over a range of potentials and not at one fixed
voltage, but the industrial demands are otherwise. For commercial
applications, a material with flat or nearly flat voltage plateau
is sought so as to have less voltage fluctuations during the working
of the full cell. Sloping regions owe their origin to a number of
factors, including incomplete initial reduction, reaction kinetics,
the formation of various metastable phases during the course of discharge,
and ion diffusion within the material.40 For example, the sloping region in the discharge profile of Mn3O4 owes its origin to slow diffusion of Li in the
intermediate LiMnO3 phase compared to fast movement in
the channels of Mn3O4.40,41 The entire sloping discharge profile in the ternary spinel oxides
arises due to the progressive movement of constituent ions while the
spinel structure converts to rock-salt type.42,43 In the case of sulfides (representative: FeS2), the sloping
regions are attributed to the conversion into various metastable Li
phases along the reaction coordinate, whereas the plateau regions
owe their origin to the initial intercalation that proceeds before
the complete conversion.42 This issue is
the least talked about in the literature, but counts as the major
drawback for these materials not being considered for practical applications.
It needs to be addressed so as to bring the voltage profile to the
plateau form or nearly plateau regime. Partial conversion can be an
option, but in that case, full benefits of conversion reaction are
nonachievable. Further insights are needed into the mechanism of conversion
in terms of identification of various metastable states, different
doping strategies that can enhance the kinetic diffusion within the
material, catalyst supports, and conductive supports as viable alternatives.

Different conversion materials have different contributions to
the total capacity. Additionally, the same conversion material in
different morphologies and compositions has been seen to display different
contributions to the total capacity. Figure 3d lists various conversion materials with
varying contributions from the sloping region and plateau regions.

Columbic Efficiency
The very low Columbic efficiencies
(even less than 75%) and higher first cycle losses have questioned
their industrialization claims since their inception.1Figure 3e shows the huge capacity loss observed in the case of Fe2O3. Various underlying phenomena can be associated with
these adversities, three of which need a mention here. They are: (1)
irreversible electrolyte decomposition, (2) incomplete back conversions,
and (3) the back conversion to the phases that can permit less Li/Na
uptake than the original one.44 In some
cases, the Columbic efficiency is remarkably improved after the few
initial cycles, but in some cases, the conditions can become worse
if the polymeric coating of SEI layer breaks.36,45 Again, enough studies have not been carried out to look for the
pedigrees behind the issue, which need to be addressed. The kinetic
path of the back conversion reactions needs to be tracked to devise
suitable strategies that can catalyze smooth and desired conversions.
The future of conversion material research shall be more focused on
fundamental studies like understanding their failure rather than devising
new conversion materials.

Rate Instabilities
Conversion materials,
in general,
are associated with lower rate performance in comparison to the intercalation
and alloying materials (Figure 3f). The massive reorganizations and the gradual movements
of ions have an impact on the overall kinetics of conversion reactions
apart from the diffusion limitations posed by the electrolyte.33,46 In addition to the sluggish ion movements in the material, the lower
electronic conductivity associated with these also imposes kinetic
limitations and thus influences power delivery.1 Thus, two approaches that can be adopted to achieve the
gain in terms of power density are either to increase the diffusion
coefficient of alkali ion in the material or to reduce the diffusion
path length. No conclusive work exists, which could explain the rate
instabilities in the materials. However, on the basis of the existing
understanding, a few strategies can be suggested. The diffusion of
ions can be enhanced by doping of foreign atoms in the material, whereas
the diffusion path lengths can be reduced by fabricating nanomaterials.

Other Issues
Although a variety of conversion materials
have been studied with enhanced electrochemical performance, there
are other challenges to be addressed for commercialization. These
include earth abundance, processing cost, supply chain, and environmental
friendliness. Here, we provide a brief insight into the challenges
for commercialization of conversion anodes other than the need for
enhancement in their electrochemical performance. Earth abundance
of the elements of interest and their regional distribution over earth
are the key factors that are highly influential for cost considerations.
Transition-metal oxides, such as iron oxide, manganese oxide, etc.,
are earth-abundant, need minimum processing cost, and show good electrochemical
performance. However, their lower electrical conductivity may restrict
their use in high-power devices. With conductivity management with
dopants or additives, these elements may stand a good chance for possible
commercialization. Although chalcogenide- and phosphide-based materials
have better capacity and electrical conductivity compared to oxides,
their complex synthesis protocols, toxicity, high reactivity under
ambient conditions, and high processing cost may limit their commercialization
at the industrial level. Further remarks on commercialization aspects
are out of the scope of this article and beyond the expertize of the
authors.

Synopsis of Relevant Literature
Figure 4 surveys the most researched conversion materials
with different reported morphologies and architectures in light of
the voltage hysteresis, discharge profile, and irreversible capacity
loss.13,47−63 These data invite some interesting analyses and potential conclusions
with regard to the issues associated with conversion materials. The
voltage hysteresis plot of relevant conversion materials is shown
in Figure 4a. Among
the various conversion types, phosphides have been seen to render
the lowest voltage hysteresis. The voltage hysteresis values in the
case of the reported CoP nanoarrays and phosphorus-rich CuP2 drop down to ∼0.4 V, which lies close to the Li hysteresis
in successful alloying materials. Oxides, on the other hand, are associated
with very high voltage hysteresis. The voltage hysteresis is inherent
to a material, and synthetic tuning like size and morphology engineering
has only a small effect. However, making composites with carbon may
help reduce the iR hysteresis.

Higher plateau
capacity contributions have been seen from oxides like Fe2O3 and Co3O4 in comparison to Mn3O4 (Figure 4b). Again, phosphides have rendered higher plateau capacity
than sulfides. Phosphorus-rich CuP2 and high-temperature-treated
NiP2 have delivered high proportion of their capacity,
77 and 75, respectively, at a constant voltage, i.e., major contribution
emanating from the plateau region.

Phosphides and sulfides of
transition metals have performed better
as far as irreversible capacity loss is concerned (Figure 4c). However, upon forming composites
with carbon, the irreversible capacity losses have been seen to increase
considerably. Thus, optimization of the carbon percentages along with
suitable choice of conversion material is a must to have minimum losses.

Brief Review of the Research on Improving the Performance of
Conversion Anodes
Size Control
Particle size has a
huge impact on the
overall electrochemical performance. Some comparative studies on the
effect of particle size have revealed a better performance of nanosized
particles than micron-sized particles. This better performance is
due to shortening of insertion path length that Li has to traverse.
Tarascon and co-workers in one of their earlier works had studied
the effect of particle size on the insertion of Li ion into α-Fe2O3.64 Their finding
revealed that nanosized Fe2O3 renders 3 times
better performance in terms of specific capacity than the micron-sized
particles. Xie and co-workers have studied the effect of the diameter
of Fe2O3 nanorods on the overall performance.65 Their measurements revealed a capacity increase
from 450 to 700 mAh g–1 when the particle diameter
changed from 60–90 to 2–16 nm.

It is useful to
point out that the voltage hysteresis and the sloping profiles have
been seen to be associated with inherent materials properties and
that the control over particle size alone does not address these issues.
But positive effects like capacity enhancement and cyclic stability
warrant the studies toward optimization of particle size because the
change in size in itself is associated with a variety of other challenging
issues like extensive electrode decomposition through SEI layer formation,
larger volume changes, loss of intrinsic conductivity, and low volumetric
capacity. The nanosize can also have a considerable influence on increasing
the rate and stability of conversion materials. The rate improvement
may mainly be effected by decreasing the diffusion paths and hence
making the material accessible at higher mass transfer rates. On the
other hand, the stability improvement in the nanosize regime may be
related to complete conversion.

The above findings reveal that
the particle size impacts the overall
performance and needs to be researched for the threshold particle
size for the optimal performance.

Morphological Control
The effects of morphology on
the capacity have already been well studied in the literature.48,66−74 Utilization of the bulk of the material upon nanostructuring leads
to considerable capacity enhancements. Ultrasmall nanoparticles, nanoneedles,
nanorods, nanospindles, nanosheets, and other nanoscale architectures
have resulted in the enhancement of capacity by the complete utilization
of material, harnessing the benefits associated with the nanomorphologies,
in general.47,48,66,75

Other issues like cyclic stability
and rate stability have also been addressed by employing suitable
morphologies.74 The suitably exposed facets
mediate a faster Li/Na transport, thereby minimizing the effects associated
with sluggish kinetics. Improvements in the overall discharge profile,
rate stability, cyclic stability, and even voltage hysteresis have
indeed been observed. The (001) facets of Fe2O3 nanosheets have been seen to mediate faster Li diffusion than the
(010) facets of Fe2O3 nanorods owing to higher
packing density of Fe3+ and O2– along
this facet.70 The enhancement in the rate
has mostly been attributed to a higher diffusion coefficient for Li
along this facet compared to the other. Similarly, studies on the
electrochemical performance of different morphologies of Co3O4 have revealed that the capacity and cyclic stability
of nanoflowers were higher compared to those of nanodisks and nanocubes.76 This result was attributed to better diffusion
paths in the former. The control on pore size and wall thickness in
some cases has been seen to boost the rate performance. The study
of Li storage in the mesoporous Mn2O3 has revealed
that although both the pore size and wall thickness have a profound
effect on the overall rate performance, the effect of pore size variations
is more significant.72 Wall thickness increase
from 5 to 8 nm was seen to bring the rate performance down considerably.
The effect of pore size distribution was more prominent. Larger pore
diameters (intermediate and higher mesoporous range; 10–30
nm) and the higher proportions of even smaller mesopores (<10 nm)
were seen to increase the rate performance considerably.

Our
group has demonstrated that Fe-based MOFs can be used to generate
porous nanostructures of Fe2O3.77 Another phase of iron oxide, Fe3O4, is considered to be promising due to its better cyclic stability
and high current performance, although the theoretical capacity 928
mAh g–1 is lower.78 In
another report from our group, magnetically separated Fe3O4 from red mud was used as an anode material in Li-ion
battery and showed 61% retention after 2000 cycles in a full-cell
assembly with LiMn2O4 as cathode.79

Several studies on the morphology tuning
for performance enhancement
have been mostly restricted to well-known shapes and morphologies
yielding only some broader picture lacking deeper insights. This situation
invites the use of interesting new experimental strategies to specifically
address multiple parametric issues simultaneously.

Composition
Control
Composition has a marked influence
on the overall performance of material. Although the oxides have been
more robust and stable, they have been found to be lacking in terms
of voltage hysteresis. On the other hand, phosphides and hydrides
have shown a lower voltage hysteresis, but are seen to be lacking
in terms of stability.

Different transition-metal compounds
with different anion species with formula MaXb, where X = F, O, S, P, and H, have
been shown to exhibit Li/Na insertion by reversible conversion reaction
with a theoretical capacity that is a factor of three higher than
that of commercial graphite. Among different conversion anodes, transition-metal
oxides are the most explored, which include both binary and ternary
oxides of 3d transition metals, such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu.
Various phases of different binary oxides of 3d transition metals,
including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, and 4d transition metals, including
Nb and Mo, have been studied for their suitability as negative electrode
in Li-ion battery.80 Similarly, transition-metal
oxides store Na-ion through conversion reaction and are considered
to be the potential choices of anode materials for Na-ion battery
as well.2

Among different oxides
studied, iron oxide (Fe2O3) is one of the well-studied
systems because of its many advantages,
including high capacity (1011 mAh g–1), earth abundance,
and stability.81 Hence, there are enormous
efforts to improve its performance by engineering the morphology,
size, precursors, and synthesis protocols.40

Oxide systems with more than one electrochemically active
transition
metal with formula AB2O4 have also been studied
as hosts for Li/Na-ion batteries.82 During
lithiation, the metal ions are reduced into individual metal nanoparticles
in the Li2O matrix. However, during delithiation, metal
nanoparticles are converted into corresponding oxides rather than
mixed transition-metal oxide. Similar to binary oxides, ternary transition-metal
oxides also exhibit low electronic conductivity and cyclic stability.
In the case of binary transition-metal oxides, the conversion from
spinel to cubic phases has been observed. However, the back conversion
has been seen to be sometimes restricted because of the lesser tendency
of one of the constituent ions to switch the oxidation states.

In addition to the oxides, other transition-metal chalcogenide
compounds (sulfides and selenides), phosphides, hydrides, and ternary
chalcogenides have also attracted much attention as anodes in Li-
and Na-ion batteries.83,84 During discharge, Li/Na reacts
with metal chalcogenides to form metal nanoparticles in the sulfide
matrix, resulting in high theoretical capacity (>800 mAh g–1).83,84 Compared to oxides, sulfides
possess better
electrical conductivity. Dissolution of the discharge product, however,
leads to low Coulombic efficiency and cycle life. Although there has
been a considerable progress along this direction, achieving high
practical capacity and cycle life still needs further improvement.
This can be achieved through tuning the size and morphology of the
compound, protecting the material to avoid a direct contact with the
electrolyte so as to avoid dissolution of polysulfides, and tuning
the electrolyte. Transition-metal phosphides can also store Li or
Na ion through conversion reactions, which yield Li3P/Na3P and metal nanoparticles as discharge products.84 Phosphides of transition metals including Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have been studied for Li/Na-storage properties.
Recently, ternary compounds with more than one anion species have
also shown promise as anode materials for alkali-ion batteries. This
includes MSxSey and MPxSy.85 The reaction mechanism involves the
reaction of both anions with Li/Na, which leads to higher theoretical
capacity.

Composite with Carbon
Composites
of conversion anodes
with polymers and carbon materials have been shown to enhance the
electrochemical performance of the active component.86 Carbon-based composites seem to be more promising as they
possess high electrical conductivity, high surface area, and good
mechanical strength.87 In addition to improving
the high current performance by reducing the electronic resistance,
the carbon support absorbs the strain due to the volume expansion
in the electrode which renders better cyclic stability.88 Different carbon forms have been employed to
make composites with the active material of the electrode.89 This includes carbon nanostructures such as
carbon nanotubes (both multiwalled and single-walled), carbon nanofibers,
graphene, carbon nanohorns, etc.27,50,75 This is generally achieved by adding functionalized
carbon nanostructures along with the metal precursor during synthesis.
A thin layer of conductive carbon-coated nanoparticle with core–shell
structure has also shown to improve the electrochemical performance.90 Such coating protects the electrode from direct
contact with the electrolyte and avoids side reactions, facilitating
stable SEI formation. This can be obtained by hydrothermal or solvothermal
treatment of the electrode material or metal with carbonaceous materials,
such as glucose, sucrose, and polymers, followed by high-temperature
annealing in inert atmosphere.91 Although
this strategy has been shown to enhance the stability and high current
performance, the main disadvantage of this method is the formation
mixed-phase/metallic form along with oxide or sulfide due to high-temperature
treatment in the argon atmosphere. Chemical vapor deposition is another
method to obtain thin carbon coating on the electrode surface.92 Instead of adding the carbon source externally,
direct use of metal precursor containing carbonaceous molecules has
been shown to be another promising strategy to develop carbon composite
of metal oxide or sulfide nanostructures. This includes metal–organic
frameworks, metal complexes, and organic salts.93 Heteroatom doping in the carbon matrix can be achieved
by adding an external source or carbonaceous compounds containing
heteroatoms.94

Although coating of
amorphous carbon layer protects the electrode material from degradation
due to volume expansion, its poor electrical conductivity limits the
high current performance of the composite. This can be compensated
by the addition of carbon forms with high electrical conductivity,
such as CNT and graphene. On the other hand, the addition of CNTs
alone fails to stabilize the electrode material unless it is protected
properly. Hence, making composites of metal oxides (MOs)/metal sulfides
(MSs) with more than one carbon matrix can overcome the limitations
of using a single carbon matrix.95

Distribution of electrode materials on high-surface-area conducting
carbon matrix shows improved performance. Increasing the amount of
carbon in the composite reduces the total capacity if the specific
capacity of the carbon is less. Xu and co-workers have shown96 that the presence of conducting graphene support
promotes core–shell conversion in the CoS2/graphene
composite instead of side-to-side conversion observed in bare single-crystalline
CoS2. Core–shell conversion is benign for the overall
lithiation and delithiation process. Figure 5 depicts the stable conversion process in
CoS2/graphene composite in comparison to the bare CoS2 conversion. Additionally, the high surface area of the composite
reduces the volumetric capacity and increases the irreversible capacity
loss in the first cycle because of the SEI formation. Hence, optimizing
the form and amount of carbon content in the composite is the most
challenging task to achieve the best performance of the electrode
material.

Conclusions
In this study, we have
evaluated the conversion materials in terms
of different key parameters that are of interest in the context of
their performance as technologically viable anode materials for alkali-ion
batteries. We recognize that apart from general limitations like volume
expansion and irreversible capacity loss, the conversion anodes need
to perform well in crossing over various other important hurdles like
larger voltage hysteresis, low cyclic stability, low rate performance,
and lower Columbic efficiency, if they are to receive any industrial
attention. We have presented the best of the lot among the state-of-the-art
materials and proposed some possible solutions for realizing their
enhanced performance. A multipronged approach, based on the available
literature and new findings, is required to address these diverse
issues.

In light of previous literature and the new insights
obtained from
in situ techniques, we present below some thoughts on the research
directions that could fuel constructive future research on the conversion
materials.1. The
research is still open toward understanding
issues like voltage hysteresis, inconsistent cyclic performance, and
origin of sloping regions in the discharge profiles (voltage-dependent
conversion) as these issues have not been properly understood as yet.
The kinetics of the conversion processes, in particular, needs a specific
attention in this respect. The multistep kinetics of conversion reaction
needs to be fully explored to locate the reaction intermediates and
various metastable states. Use of techniques such as in situ solid-state
NMR, in situ XAS, in situ transmission electron microscopy electron
tomography, atomic force microscopy, and other dynamic characterization
approaches may be central for battery research in the next decade
as far as conversion materials are concerned.

2. The issue of irreversible capacity
loss in the conversion materials in full-cell assembly can aggravate
into serious failures. Thus, a variety of prefabrication strategies
may be required to undo the associated problems, although their commercial
viability may have to be concurrently established. Some of these include
prelithiation/sodiation, short circuit, adding stabilized lithium
nanoparticles, and use of different electrolyte additives. However,
none of these has thus far solved the issue uniquely and completely.
Thus, synthetic and engineering strategies that account for these
issues in advance shall be the main component of future research on
conversion types.

3. At
the material level, novel synthesis,
fabrication, and postsynthesis processing strategies can be of real
value in terms of directly addressing the issues, but have surprisingly
been less explored in the present context. Architectural control through
the use of patterned electrodes and the use of thin-film deposition
techniques to construct heterostructures through techniques like pulsed
laser deposition, atomic layer deposition, and other deposition methods
may lead to the resolution of some specific issues related to the
conversion-type materials.

4. Certain facets of oxides like Fe2O3 and Co3O4 have been seen
to promote better diffusion of Li and Na than others. Thus, exposure
of suitable facets is important as far as the kinetic stability (rate
performance) is concerned. So far, these findings have been taken
rather less seriously and attempts toward targeted synthesis of the
morphologies that can have suitably exposed facets are needed to be
intensified. Additionally, there is need for theoretical calculations
(predictive modeling) for the recognition of specific phases that
can kinetically promote faster diffusion.

5. The diffusion of Li/Na is a very important
factor for better power delivery. It has been observed that elemental
or defect doping could enhance the diffusion coefficient of Li/Na
within oxides. Thus, novel valence-controlled doping strategies should
be adopted so as to have enough defects in the materials, which in
turn could mediate better diffusion of alkali ions within the material.
The proper choice of conversion materials, with optimized size and
morphology, and their composites with optimized amounts of specific
carbon forms can help achieve the best for this class of materials.

6. The use of micro- and nanopatterned
electrodes and the direct growth of aligned one-dimensional structures
that has been tried in the case of alloying materials may fit the
bill for engineering conversion-type anodes as well. The benefits
of nanostructuring with reduced diffusion paths, better material utilization,
better accommodation of volume expansion, and better material connectivity
with the substrate can be achieved by employing strategies such as
photolithography, patterning, and laser writing techniques.

7. Self-discharge and memory
effects in
the Li/Na-ion batteries are less known and have been neglected. However,
very recent findings have revealed the existence of memory-type effects
in cathode materials, i.e., LiFePO4.97 Similarly, self-discharge has been observed in some LiMn2O4/C Li-ion batteries.98 High temperature and thermal history of battery have also been reported
to mediate the self-discharge in the LiCoO2 cathode.99 Thus, in full-cell configurations for applications
other than mobile electronics, where the battery can get exposed to
higher thermal conditions, the occurrence of these additional issues
cannot be overlooked. Memory effects and self-discharges in anode
materials have so far not been reported in their half-cell configurations,
to the best our knowledge. However, in full-cell configurations involving
conversion materials, these issues have to be addressed, especially
in the context of potential commercialization.
