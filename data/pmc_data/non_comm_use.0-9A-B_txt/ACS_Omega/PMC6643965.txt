A thick coating of
hierarchically porous double-templated TiO2–ZrO2–PMMA–PF127 with excellent
self-cleaning properties and high transmittance has been developed
for the first time on glass substrates using a simple dip-coating
technique. Comparative studies of this sample with a thick and transparent
coating of single-templated TiO2–ZrO2–PMMA have been performed to probe the origin of its exceptional
properties. The formation of the composites, successful incorporation
of the polymer into the matrix, and the porous nature of the films
have been studied. The presence of Ti2+ in the double-templated
samples has been confirmed, which suggest the chemisorption of water
on the surface of the film. The variation in the self-cleaning properties
of the samples on UV-illumination has also been studied. The double-templated
film is found to possess the capability of good hydrophilic retention
even 2 days after UV-irradiation.

Introduction
It has been reported that hydrophilic
coatings of inorganic metal
oxides with large surface area and high porosity clean the surface
quickly.1 Addition of polymers to inorganic
binary metal oxide composites, on the other hand, is known to facilitate
the spreading nature of liquid, and the surface roughness can trap
the water molecules.2 Theoretical works
of Wenzel and Cassie–Baxter suggest that maximal increase in
wetting property of the surface can be achieved by the enhancement
of its roughness.3−5 Also, there are many recent reports on hydrophilicity
achieved through nanoporous structure formation on the film surface.2,6 Therefore, multifunctional polymer-incorporated inorganic composites
in the form of meso/micro/macroporous films, membranes, and powders
are of great significance as they have potential applications as self-cleaning
glasses for solar cells, gas-sensing devices, photovoltaic devices,
and window glass for green intelligent buildings.7−11

TiO2 as a self-cleaning coating
has high transmittance
and has the advantage to make use of both solar energy and rainfall
to clean the surface, which reduces the cost of maintenance.12 For further improving the transmittance, hydrophilicity,
and mechanical and thermal stabilities, the general approach is to
synthesize binary composites involving TiO2 and a low refractive
index material such as ZrO2, SiO2, and so forth.13 The excess amount of hydroxyl groups present
in TiO2–ZrO2/TiO2–SiO2 hybrid composites trap photoinduced holes, which increase
the photocatalytic activity by delaying the recombination of electron–hole
pairs.14 This implies that such a coating
would be able to breakdown the dirt absorbed onto its surface in the
presence of sunlight.15

The hydroxyl
group-trapping ability of TiO2–ZrO2/SiO2 along with high porosity of polymer-incorporated
composites can be combined together in TiO2–ZrO2/SiO2–polymer coatings. Although there are
a few reports on the hydrophilic nature of such coatings, some major
disadvantages of such films remain unaddressed.16,17 The development of such coatings is of extreme significance, and
efforts are underway to realize them. In most of the literature, which
reports the formation of superhydrophilic transparent coatings, the
thickness of the coating is on the nanoscale.12,14,17 Nevertheless, the large-scale production
of such thin self-cleaning glasses is really expensive because of
the sophisticated techniques involved. In this work, single-templated
and double-templated porous, thick, yet transparent films of TiO2–ZrO2–pluronic F127 (PF127), and/or
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) have been prepared via the sol-gel
dip-coating method. The prepared samples are found to exhibit excellent
self-cleaning properties, which can be substantially retained for
hours. Such coatings have significant scientific and technological
importance as their properties can easily be tailored by controlling
the stoichiometry of the composition, type of polymer, and synthesis
parameters.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterization
The
composition of the
as-prepared coatings is primarily analyzed using elemental mapping
and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The elemental maps
of titanium (Ti), carbon (C), oxygen (O), and zirconium (Zr) in both
TZP and TZPPF are obtained using SEM and shown in Figure 1a–f. Composition of
Ti is larger than that of Zr, which is obvious from the mapping and
all of the elements are evenly distributed. In addition, it can also
be seen that the distribution of Ti is more even in TZPPF, which may
be an indicative of the importance of role played by the structure
directing agent in molding the fabric of film.

Figure 1 Elemental mapping analysis
of each element present in (a–c)
TZPPF film and (d–f) TZP film.

The FTIR spectra (Figure 2) of the samples show a small peak at 460 cm–1 corresponding to the Ti–O vibrations.18 The low-frequency band at 930 cm–1 is
attributed to Ti–O–Ti stretching vibrations.19−21 The weak band observed at 652 cm–1 corresponds
to the Zr–O–Ti bond, which authenticates the composite
formation.22 The broad band at 3241 cm–1 in both spectra depicts the bending vibrations of
OH groups originating from the moisture adsorbed on PMMA. The C–O–C
stretching vibrations arising from the copolymer PF127 also exist
at 1067 cm–1, which overlaps with the Ti–O
bond vibrations.21,22 The additional peak at 1375 cm–1 represents the presence of CH2 and C–C
bonds of PF127. The increase in the intensity of absorption is mainly
seen at 1278, 2873, and 2950 cm–1 in TZPPF. This
is due to the presence of the polymer PF127, which is absent in TZP.23

Figure 2 Comparative FTIR spectrum for the region 400–4000
cm–1 of the films.

In order to study the structure of the film thoroughly, Raman
spectroscopic
studies of the films were carried out. The Raman spectra of the samples
excited with 633 nm line of He–Ne laser are shown in Figure 3a,b. Using group
theory, six active Raman modes A1g + 2B1g +
3Eg are predicted for tetragonal ZrO2 in the
range 100–1000 cm–1, whereas monoclinic ZrO2 shows 18 active bands like doublet peak at 180 cm–1 and so forth.22 TiO2 mainly
exists in two forms: anatase and rutile. Raman fundamental modes for
anatase TiO2 are appearing at 144 (Eg),
399 (B1g), 519 (B1g), and 639 cm–1(Eg), respectively, whereas those of rutile
occur at 143 cm–1 (B1g), 447 cm–1 (Eg), 612 cm–1 (A1g), and
826 cm–1 (B2g).24 It is obvious that the positions of some Raman bands of TiO2 and ZrO2 are in close proximity because of which
it is difficult to distinguish them in the spectra. Eight peaks can
be observed at 180, 433, 510, 565, 663, 824, 887, and 947 cm–1 for the TZPPF film, and these peaks belong to the fundamental vibrations
of TiO2 and ZrO2. The bands at 433, 887, and
947 cm–1 are assigned to Ti–O vibrations,
whereas those at 180, 824, and 565 cm–1 are ascribed
to Zr–O vibrations. The peak at 510 cm–1 is
attributed to Ti–O, which is clearly observable in the TZPPF
film. For the TZP film, peaks are observed at 186, 428, 565, 663,
818, 885, and 951 cm–1. The peaks at 428, 886, and
951 cm–1 belong to TiO2, whereas ZrO2 peaks are observed at 186, 818, and 565 cm–1.22,25−27 In the spectra of both
films, the peak at 663 cm–1 is observed, which is
characteristic for both anatase-TiO2 and monoclinic-ZrO2.28 Thus, Raman spectra of composite
films show peaks corresponding to both anatase-TiO2 and
monoclinic-ZrO2. This implies that although the incorporation
of ZrO2 into TiO2 leads to the mixed metal-oxide
network as evident from FTIR, part of the matrix is formed of separate
phases of TiO2 and ZrO2.29,30

Surface Morphology
The formation of porous structures
in the as-prepared coatings is confirmed using small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) investigations,
which are shown in Figure 4a–f. From the figure, it is evident that the SAXS plot
of double-templated composite TZPPF film shows peak corresponding
to diffused scattering at lower 2θ values.31 The main reason for this scattering in TZPPF is its surface
roughness resulting from the pore formation.32 On the contrary, in the case of TZP, a small shoulder appears in
the scattering curve. This has to do with the short-range crystalline
nature of the titania–zirconia matrix rather than diffused
scattering. Thus, the SAXS result confirms that the composite-containing
PF127 is highly porous owing to the disappearance of the shoulder
at 0.18°, whereas the pores are absent in the sample with PMMA
only. The faint rings in the 2D-SAXS diffraction pattern denote the
presence of domains with the same structure but with different orientations
corresponding to the surface. These domains are formed as a result
of the mesostructure organization of pluronic F127. Such rings, however,
are not observed distinctively in TZP because of the absence of domains.33 The WAXS analysis also confirms that the porosity
is present in TZPPF as the intensity of its diffraction peak at 5.6°
has reduced compared to the other sample. The presence of reflections
in the WAXS for both the samples highlights the absence of structural
degradation of the inorganic matrix even after the addition of pluronic
F127.34,35

and TZP composites.

TZPPF and (f) TZP.

A comparison of field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
images (Figure 5a,b)
clearly shows the formation of surface porosity in TZPPF, whereas
such a nature is absent in TZP. From Figure 5a, it is clear that there are pores as large
as 65 nm and as small as 10 nm and these pores are spread all over
the surface. This proves that the film has a bimodal porous (mesopores
and macropores) structure, and because these pores are accessible
from the top, the water falling on the surface can easily diffuse
through the porous framework. The thicknesses of TZP and TZPPF composite
films are very close having values of 2.65 and 2.56μm, respectively,
as shown in Figure 5c,d which depicts the cross-sectional view of the coatings.

Figure 5 FESEM images
of (a) TZPPF film at 1 μm and (b) TZP film at
1 μm. Lateral cross section of (c) TZP and (d) TZPPF films.

Although the FESEM images clearly
disclose the porosity of the
sample, it gives very limited idea about the surface roughness. Therefore,
atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies are performed to gather information
about surface roughness. The 2D AFM images of double-templated and
single-templated films are recorded and are shown in Figure 6a,b respectively. These figures
are similar to the FESEM images as the former shows the formation
of mesoporous structure, whereas the latter has no such characteristic.
The 3D AFM images shown in Figure 6c,d show regular nanotroughs and nanopits at the surface
of both samples, which, however, is prominent and well distinguishable
only in TZPPF. The parameters used for characterizing surface roughness
are average roughness (Sa), root-mean-square
roughness (Sq), skewness (Ssk), and kurtosis (Sku). The Sa, Sq, Ssk, and Sku values for the
TZP are evaluated to be 0.473 nm, 0.595 nm, −0.032, and
3.124, respectively, whereas for TZPPF their respective values are
1.236 nm, 1.657 nm, −1.298, and 5.299. Because the TZPPF
has Sq value higher than 1 nm, it can
be inferred that it has a spherical pore shape with highly roughened
air/solid interface. Single-templated thin film on the other hand,
with a Sq value less than 1 nm, has an
ultraflat surface as confirmed by the FESEM analysis.36 Kurtosis and skewness values help to describe deviation
in texture characteristics such as height distribution, surface roughness,
and so forth. The negative value of skewness represents the symmetry
of peaks and valleys skewed upward relative to the average surface
plane as the center. The kurtosis value greater than 3 implies that
surface height distribution is not Gaussian-like, which implies relatively
spiky surfaces.37,38 Comparing the skewness and kurtosis
value of both surfaces, it is obvious that the TZPPF surface is more
spiky with dominant peaks compared to the TZP surface. Thus, the FESEM
and AFM studies together confirm the bimodal porous structure of the
TZPPF film. Increase in surface roughness is also clearly demonstrated
from the AFM analysis.

film. 3D

Although the FESEM and AFM images have shown that
both mesopores
and macropores are present in the surface layers of TZPPF, these studies
failed to confirm the presence of micropores. For verifying if micropores
are present in the samples, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) images of the surface are taken, which are shown
in Figure 7. The figure
shows a close-up view of the surface of both samples. The darker regions
in the images indicate thicker portions on the surface. This indirectly
signals the surface roughness of the film. These regions can better
be distinguished using color contrast versions of the images. From Figure 7c,d it is evident
that the thicker regions (blue) are scattered in TZP. It can also
be seen that there exist no large patches of thinner regions (golden)
in this sample. On the other hand, the thicker regions of TZPPF prevail
as small clusters. These clusters are not scattered as much as they
are in TZP and large patches of thinner regions are also found to
exist on the surface of this film. The results give a clear indication
of higher surface roughness and micropore formation in TZPPF, which
makes it a trimodal porous system.

films. Their respective
color contrast versions are labeled as (c,d).

The Raman mapping images of the surface of samples are shown
in Figure 8, which
reveals the
distribution of various components. The individual components in the
composite are assigned different colors as indicated in the figure
for the sake of identification. It is obvious from Figure 8a that on the surface of TZPPF
coating, there are thick green lumps of polymer, which actually covers
some portions of the TiO2–ZrO2 distribution.
They are also interconnected by thin strands of polymers. On keen
observation, it can be seen that these lumps of polymers create the
walls of the pores. However, the floors (and in some areas the lower
walls) of these pores would mostly be built of TiO2–ZrO2. Contrarily, large well-distinguishable blocks of polymer
and semiconductor matrix are found to exist in TZP as PF127 is absent
in them. This suggests that pores are not formed in this sample, which
is substantiated by the Raman mapping images.

the distribution of elements in (a) TZPPF
film and (b) TZP film. Images are plotted on the relative intensity
scale. Colors other than the assigned colors arise due to the associated
presence of the constituents.

Superhydrophilicity and Transmittance of the Films
The wetting
behavior of the as-prepared films having different surface
topographies has been evaluated using contact angle (CA) measurements.
CA is the angle between solid surface and tangent to the liquid surface
at the contact point. Parameters such as surface energy, work of adhesion,
and spreading coefficient (Sc) can be
calculated using CA values. A positive value of spreading coefficient
indicates that a liquid will wet immediately and spread on the surface
of the sample completely. Finite CA (i.e., > 0°) means Sc will be negative, which implies the lack of
spontaneous wetting.39−41

CA measurements of TZPPF and TZP are carried
out before and after UV-treatment, and the CA values and its related
parameters are listed in Table 1. The untreated composite film with PF127 behaves as a better
wetting surface as evidenced by its lower CA of 57° as compared
to 92° of the TZP. This has directly to do with the porous structure
and high roughness of the former whose joint effect would help smooth
spreading and channeling of the water. This is mainly called the “wicking
effect”, in which the water in contact with the film surface
will be drawn to the pores by capillary suction force, which later
flows easily through the valleys on the surface. Furthermore, these
composite surfaces have large number of hydrocarbon molecules. The
force that links hydrocarbons together is much stronger than the force
between water molecules, and hence water on the composite wets the
surface. The possibility of polar and nonpolar interactions across
the interface also gives higher adhesion between water and composite.
A lower value of Sc for double-templated
composite as compared to the single-templated one indicates that the
former’s surface is more hydrophilic.42 This is substantiated by the observation of higher work of adhesion
value for TZPPF, which suggests that larger amount of energy is required
to separate water drops from its surface than that of TZP.

Further enhancement
in the spreading of water is possible by treating
the films with UV illumination as TiO2 is abundant in the
matrix. The water CAs (WCAs) for TZP and TZPPF thin films after 3
h of UV irradiation are found to get reduced to a great extent, acquiring
the values 29° and 19°, respectively. Such an enhancement
occurs because of the photogeneration of electron–hole pairs
in TiO2 during UV illumination. This will result in the
reduction of Ti4+ cations to Ti3+ state and
oxidation of O2– anions thus expelling
some oxygen atoms.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies
are performed on
the samples to analyze the presence of Ti2+ in TZPPF and
hence conforming the accuracy of the proposed model, and the corresponding
spectra are shown in Figure 9a,b. It is obvious that TZP samples have no pores on its surface.
The Ti 2p3/2 spin–orbital splitting photoelectrons
are observed near to the binding energy of 458 eV for both films.
The deconvolution of the broad Ti 2p3/2 peak of the TZPPF
thin film gives three components with binding energies 458.6, 458.2,
and 455.1 eV, respectively. Interestingly, for TZP, the very same
peak when deconvoluted gives only two components with binding energies
457.8 and 456.5 eV. The bands at 458.6 eV for TZPPF film and 457.8
eV in TZP film are assigned to Ti4+ 2p3/2, which
confirms the formation of TiO2.43 Peaks occurring at binding energies 458.2 and 456.5 eV, respectively,
for TZPPF and TZP indicate the Ti3+ 2p3/2 state,
whereas the presence of an additional small shoulder at 455.09 eV
in the spectra of the former sample corresponds to the Ti2+ 2p3/2 state.44 It can be noted
that the most intense component in the deconvoluted 2p3/2 peak for the TZPPF thin film on the higher energy part corresponds
to the Ti4+ state, whereas the other components with second
largest and smallest peaks belong to the Ti3+ and Ti2+ states, respectively.17,44−47 The intensity ratio of the peak corresponding to Ti4+ to that of Ti3+ (i.e., ITi4+/ITi3+) for TZPPF is lower compared to that of the
TZP film, which means that major portion of titanium in TZP assumes
a 4+ oxidation state. Thus, the feeble presence of Ti3+ in TZP would be unable to endow the material with hydrophilic nature
till UV-irradiation is realized in order to generate more Ti3+. These Ti3+ would physisorb the water to the surface,
which would make it hydrophilic as reported by Takeuchi et al.48 On the other hand, Figure 9a suggests that the TZP has much reduced
concentration of Ti4+, which enables it to chemisorb water
from the atmosphere with the aid of its pores. Such a reduction in
Ti4+ concentration is a result of the higher surface area
of the porous film, which exposes more titanium atoms to the surrounding
as backed by the Raman imaging and HR-TEM studies discussed earlier.
The most interesting observation that is made from the XPS is the
strong presence of Ti2+ in TZPPF. Such an intense peak
gives a strong indication of the formation of hydrogen bonding as
a result of chemisorption of water. It can be noted that Ti2+ is absent in TZP, which is a consequence of the absence of pores
in it.

Figure 9 XPS spectra of Ti 2p3/2 in (a) TZP and (b) TZPPF films,
(c) Zr 3d, and (d) O 1s.

Further evidence of the Ti2+ oxidation state in
the
sample can be obtained from the XPS peaks corresponding to oxygen,
which are shown in Figure 9d. The O 1s spectrum for TZPPF can be observed to be broad
with the main peak at 531.1 eV and a shoulder at 529.3 eV. The peak
at 531.1 eV is assigned to the elemental O 1s, which makes bonds with
Ti4+ and Ti3+. The shoulder observed at 529.3
eV in the XPS of TZPPF is attributed to the presence of oxygen, bonded
with Ti2+ in the sample.49 The
lower binding energy in this case, which finds its origin in the chemisorption
of water, is understandable because the binding energy of typical
covalent bond, which exists in titania, is much higher. It can be
observed that for TZP, no such peak is observed, which suggests that
no chemisorption is occurring in the sample. A similar result would
not be observed in the case of zirconia because it is not hydrophilic
all by itself. The Zr 3d XPS spectra have two peaks corresponding
to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 and are shown in Figure 9c. The Zr4+ 3d5/2 spin–orbital splitting levels for TZP and
TZPPF are located at binding energies of 182.2 and 181.9 eV, respectively,
whereas their corresponding binding energies of Zr4+ 3d3/2 level are 184.2 and 184.8 eV, respectively.14,46

It can be observed from Table 1 that on increasing the UV-irradiation time to 6 h,
the CA is found to further diminish to about 25° and 10°
for TZP and TZPPF, respectively, which suggests that the latter attains
the superhydrophilic nature. It is worth noting that when the illumination
time is increased, the CA decreases only by 4° in the case of
TZP, whereas a reduction of 9° is observed in TZPPF. This discrepancy
is most probably due to the increased number of exposed TiO2 in latter compared to the former. The presence of pores would enhance
the effective surface area and thus the number of exposed atoms, which
capture chemisorbed water molecules. Another interesting observation
that can be made from Table 1 is that the hydrophilicity is more retainable in TZPPF 24
h post UV-illumination. For TZP, the CA has increased to 32.73 from
25.27 (29.5% increase), whereas its value became 11.03 from 10.09
(9.3% increase) for TZPPF, which is comparatively much lower. Even
48 h after UV treatment, the CA of TZPPF has only reduced to 17.60
(74% deviation from the initial value), whereas that of TZP undergoes
a change of 113% from its initial value. A behavior like this invokes
curiosity and unraveling the reason behind it would be of great interest.
Addition of ZrO2 in TiO2 is reported to generate
more hydroxyl groups that can accept holes on UV radiation, thus preventing
the electron–hole recombination leading to prolonged existence
of hydrophilic nature in the sample.14 However,
this is not the only reason for a completely retainable hydrophilic
nature observed in TZPPF, as such a nature is absent in TZP despite
the presence of equal amount of ZrO2.

The Raman imaging
suggested that the pores in TZPPF have its upper
walls made up of polymer (PMMA + PF127) and lower walls of TiO2–ZrO2. Because PMMA is hydrophobic, the
upper walls would be hydrophobic, whereas the lower walls and base
of the pores would be hydrophilic. The hydrophobic walls would roll
off the dirt, which falls on the surface into the depths of the pores.
However, chemisorbed water in the lower walls and base of the pores
would prevent the dirt from coming into direct contact with them and
getting attached. On the contrary, in TZP, the chances of chemisorptions
are much lesser because of the reduced surface area. Therefore, retainability
of hydrophilic nature of TZPPF is much higher because of its porous
structure.

For most applications such as photocatalytic devices
and window
panes, which require hydrophilic coatings, high transmittance in the
visible region and high absorption in the UV region of the optical
spectrum are a prerequisite. Most of the previously reported self-cleaning
coatings with high transmittance have had very low thicknesses (in
the nanometer range). However, for practical applications, coatings
with such low thicknesses, whose production would need sophisticated
and expensive techniques, are not desirable. Thick coatings with both
hydrophilic nature and high transmittance on the other hand do not
involve many complexities in their production and therefore are the
need of the hour. In this study, it has already been discussed that
both TZP and TZPPF show strong hydrophilic character after UV illumination
at the same time having high thickness values (∼2.7 μm). Figure 10 shows the transmission
spectra of single- and double-templated thin films on the glass substrates.
The TZPPF has a transmittance slightly lesser than that of TZP, even
though their thicknesses values are really close. This discrepancy
is due to the low transmittance of PF127 in the former. Still both
films show high transmittance, and they are comparable to the results
obtained for similar hydrophilic coatings with much lesser thickness
values.12,14,50 For TZPPF,
the average transmittance in the visible region is 81%, whereas that
for TZP is 84%. A sharp fall in the transmittance at 365 nm indicates
the UV absorption by TiO2 in the coatings. Thus, this study
clearly indicates that the prepared samples are extremely potent candidates
for self-cleaning applications.

the films.

Conclusions
The
fact that the as-prepared TiO2–ZrO2–PMMA–PF127
hydrophilic coating is very thick and yet
remains highly transparent in the UV–visible region makes it
the first to be reported with a combination of favorable properties.
The structure and surface studies have revealed that the chance of
chemisorption is very high in the porous films as it can hold water
for more time compared to a flat surface. The complicated surface
of the porous film is created with polymer forming the outer walls
of the pores, whereas TiO2–ZrO2 forming
the inner walls and base. Whereas normal hydrophilic cleaning occurs
in UV-irradiated non-porous coating, a complicated mechanism occurs
in the porous one with a hydrophobic roll off of dirt into the pores
followed by an easy washout with water.

used was TIP/ZP/(PF127 + PMMA) = 70:25:5 wt %. Pluronic F127 and PMMA
were dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol at 50 °C. Separately stirred
inorganic precursor sols were mixed with polymer solution and stirred
for about 2 h at 50 °C. Two or three drops of DEA, which acts
as a chelating ligand, were added dropwise under vigorous stirring.
On the contrary, single-templated TiO2–ZrO2 thin film prepared via the same method has 5 wt % of PMMA.

Both films were deposited on glass substrates by the dip-coating
technique (withdrawal rate 2 mm/s) followed by aging for 10 days at
50 °C. Single- and double-templated samples are designated as
TZP and TZPPF, respectively.

Dip-Coating Process
The dip-coating
process was carried
out using an ion exchanger dip-coating apparatus (Holmarc model no.
HO-TH-IE01) to prepare thin films TZP and TZPPF.

UV Degradation
Process
A UV degradation chamber built
by Prism Foundation, Bangalore, composed of UV LED strips with a wavelength
of 365 nm was used to study the UV degradation activity of the coated
TZP and TZPPF thin films.

Characterization of Films
X-ray
energy-dispersive spectrometry
was conducted using Bruker model: XFlash 6/10. FTIR spectra of the
samples were recorded on the transmittance mode using a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 400 FTIR spectrometer in the range (400–4000) cm–1 with a resolution of 1 cm–1. FESEM
was performed on gold-coated samples using FEI model: Nova NanoSEM
450. The surface relief of the films was examined by AFM Nanoscope
IIIa, Digital Instrument, USA, operating in the taping mode with a
silicon tip. Surface hydrophilicity was studied from static WCA measurements
using a SEO Phoenix CA analyser, and the images captured using a digital
camera at room temperature. Measurements were done with deionized
water, and volume of water drop was maintained at 6–8 μL
using a microsyringe. The size and crystalline nature of colloidal
TiO2–ZrO2 nanoparticles were investigated
by TEM JEOL-JEM-2010, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200
kV. The 2D wide- and small-angle X-ray diffraction images were obtained
using a XEUSS SAXS/WAXS system by Xenocs. The source for the radiation
is Cu Kα with wavelength 1.54 Å. The images were converted
into 1D pattern with the aid of Fit2D software. Raman spectra were
recorded on a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM-HR 800 spectrograph, equipped
with a 632 nm helium–neon laser with 20 mW of power, attached
to an Olympus BHX microscope. XPS was performed using a Kratos analytical
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.
