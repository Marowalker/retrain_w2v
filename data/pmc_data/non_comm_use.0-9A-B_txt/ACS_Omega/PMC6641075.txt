In
this article, we describe the deposition by aerosol-assisted
spray pyrolysis of different types of silver vanadate nanocomposites
with and without graphene oxide (GO) on different substrates (carbon
paper (CP) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)). When deposited on
CP, different amounts of GO were added to the Ag and V precursor solution
to study the effect of GO on the physicochemical properties of the
resulting Ag-vanadate. It is shown that the addition of GO leads mainly
to the formation of nanoparticles of the Ag2V4O11 phase, whereas Ag2V4O11 and Ag3VO4 are obtained without the addition
of GO. The morphology and chemical properties of the composites were
determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray
diffraction, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and UV–visible
and Raman spectroscopies. In addition, the photoelectrochemical (PEC)
properties of such composites were studied by CV, linear sweep voltammetry,
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ideal AgxVOy and GO ratio was
optimized for obtaining higher photocurrent values and a good stability.
The results showed that the presence of GO improves the electrical
conductivity of the catalyst layer as well as the electron injection
from the oxide to the electrode surface. The deposition of pure Ag2V4O11 on FTO does not lead to samples
with stable PEC performances. Samples grown on CP supports showed
an efficient electrochemical detection of small amounts of ethylenediamine
in water solution.

Introduction
Silver vanadates, especially in the form
of α-Ag3VO4 and AgVO3, are
photocatalysts characterized
by a sufficiently large band gap (ca. 2.0–2.2 eV1−8), potentially stable at water oxidation potentials due to the high
oxidation state of V and the monovalent preference of Ag. Other Ag-vanadates,
like Ag2V4O11, have been studied
and used as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries9 and, more recently, as active materials in gas sensing
devices. In particular, nanoribbons of Ag2V4O11 were used in the detection of amines and alcohols
in the gas phase with good sensitivity.10 Nevertheless, up to now, the studies of these materials as photocatalysts
have focused on particles dispersed in water, and most of them have
addressed dye degradation. The particles are usually synthesized by
hydrothermal methods or simple precipitation. Nevertheless, these
experimental conditions (samples in the powder form) make difficult
the accurate measurement of important quantities such as flat-band
potential, photocurrent onset potential, and the photocurrent as a
function of potential. α-Ag3VO4 thin films,
like other vanadates, can be difficult to prepare by standard growth
techniques (CVD and sputtering, for example, because of the difficulties
in obtaining a definite stoichiometry), but very recently a study
by Chemelewski et al. described the successive ionic layer adsorption
and reaction (SILAR) growth of α-Ag3VO4 thin films and their characterization for photoelectrochemical water
splitting (PEC-WS).11 The results of this
study demonstrate that the as-grown material is characterized by p-type
conductivity and therefore cannot be used as a photoanode. However,
an annealing treatment in air up to 300 °C introduces n-type
conductivity. Unfortunately, the resulting n-type behavior is unstable
under photocatalytic water oxidation conditions, so that the photocurrent
continuously decreases with a corresponding anodic shift of the flat-band
potential. The authors interpreted this behavior to be due to the
removal of oxygen vacancies by photo-oxidation. This hypothetical
self-oxidation is also in agreement with the evidence that hole scavengers
are not able to increase the measured photocurrent. The conclusion
of this study was that, although the results are not promising for
the outlook of α-Ag3VO4 as a PEC-WS material
per se, its low band gap still makes it interesting for developing
nanosystems characterized by a more efficient charge extraction by
further nanostructuring. This statement and the lack in the literature
of methods for preparing controlled nanostructured thin films led
us to investigate the use of aerosol-assisted spray pyrolysis as an
alternative, easy, and highly scalable technique to deposit Ag-vanadates
(AgxVOy) on
conductive substrates, either conventional carbon materials or transparent
conductive oxides (such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)), to improve
the photocurrent stability and charge extraction. Although probably
not suitable as PEC-WS materials yet, Ag-vanadates are attractive
materials for the sensing of organics in a water solution taking advantage
of their n-type conductivity that allows their use as photoanodes
enhancing the detection sensitivity as already done in the case of
TiO2 thin films coupled with Cu2O nanoparticles.12 Moreover, the aerosol-assisted spray pyrolysis
allows depositing a large variety of nanocomposite materials containing
graphene oxide (GO) or reduced GO by a simple “one-pot”
procedure. The rationale behind the addition of this second component
lies in the possibility to improve the electrical contact among the
oxide particles with the substrate, thus enhancing the injection of
electrons on the electrode surface and therefore the PEC performances.
Also, the presence of GO helps to obtain nanocomposites with a high
surface area, by increasing the number of nucleation sites, acting
as a sort of “fishing net” configuration13 and eventually inducing the formation of different
crystal phases. We used a precursor solution (VO43– and Ag+) in which Ag+ ions are kept solvated
by complexation with NH3. The consequent alkaline pH also
allows the stabilization of GO sheets forming a stable suspension.
We have deposited AgxVOy NPs by the aerosol-assisted method with different amounts
of GO on a carbon paper (CP) and on an FTO glass. After the characterization
of the materials by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements,
we have verified that when GO is added to the mixture the main phase
is actually Ag2V4O11. We have tested
these electrodes as photoanodes under visible light in KHCO3 solution, and, at variance with the results obtained on the films
deposited by SILAR on FTO,11 we found a
rather stable photocurrent for pure and AgxVOy&GO composite materials on the
CP support. Moreover, the presence Ag+ ions in these materials
makes them interesting candidates for the electrochemical detection
of ammines.

Results and Discussion
Material Characterization
In Figure 1, we report the SEM
images of the deposits
on CP obtained from pure AgxVOy solution and AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL. In the former
case, it is well evident (Figure 1a) that the carbon fibers of the CP are coated with
particles of very different shapes and sizes, whereas in the latter
(Figure 1b,c) the particles
are apparently smaller and more uniformly distributed. As evident
from Figure 1b,c, the
GO sheets are coating some areas of the carbon fibers like a “blanket”.
In Figure 1c, the typical
wrinkles of GO sheets are also clearly visible. In Figure 1d, the morphology of the deposit
obtained on the FTO glass is shown. The particles have a rather large
size distribution (30–200 nm) with spherical particles growing
on platelet-like larger crystals.

from precursor solutions
containing pure AgxVOy (a) and AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL (b). (c) Close-up view of the deposit
from AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL. (d) Morphology of the deposit obtained on FTO.

Figure 2 shows the
results from XPS and WAXD measurements on the AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL sample.
The V 2p signals together with the O 1s peak are reported in Figure 2a. The V 2p3/2 signal is found, as expected, at 517.6 eV (V+5), and
no other component is present.14,15 The O 1s Kα3,4 satellite is also visible in the fitted spectra at about
522.4 eV. The O 1s peak (Figure 2a), instead, can be fitted with at least two components:
the main one at 530.6 eV, corresponding to V–O bonds,15 and the component at about 532.5 eV, which can
be assigned to −OH and −COOH groups in GO and adsorbed
water molecules. Because the O 1s peak of GO is also characterized
by a main component at 530.5 eV, it is not possible (spectra not reported)
to calculate the accurate stoichiometry (V/O ratio). In any case,
if only the first O 1s component is considered, the resulting stoichiometry
would be VO3.5. However, the Ag MNN Auger peak (Figure 2b) shows, very clearly,
the presence of both Ag+ and metallic Ag. The fitting of
the Ag MNN peak allows us to estimate the Ag+/Ag ratio16 (1:1), and consequently, the Ag+/V
ratio in the vanadate was found to be 0.5. The presence of metallic
Ag is also verified by WAXD (Figure 2c):19 the WAXD data show
the presence of metallic Ag, Ag3VO4, and Ag2V4O11. The presence of the peak at 2θ
= 29.4° is clearly attributable to the presence of Ag2V4O1117 (see also
Raman spectra discussion below), whose structure is reported in Figure 2d. This peak should
correspond to reflection from the (2̅03) planes, which is particularly
evident in the case of Ag2V4O11 prepared
at alkaline pH, as in our case.10,18 The intense peaks at
2θ = 38.1 and 44.3° confirm the presence of metallic Ag.
It is noteworthy that in the case of the deposit obtained without
GO, the peaks at 2θ = 31 and 32.4°, which can be attributed
to Ag3VO4, are more intense, indicating that
the presence of GO leads to a higher Ag2V4O11/Ag3VO4 ratio. To obtain the weight
ratio of the different phases, we applied the quantitative analysis
of the diffraction patterns of powder mixtures19 that allows obtaining, considering the different absorption
coefficients of each phase, the corresponding fraction by weight.
To achieve greater accuracy, we proceeded to the deconvolution of
the peaks, by the application of the least-squares fit elaborated
by Hindeleh and Johnson20 and to the determination
of the intensity, calculated as the area subtended by each peak. The
results of this analysis are given inTable 1.

Phases from XRD Analysis

Ag3VO4	37%	14%	
Ag	45%	67%	
a The differences
between the amounts
of phases measured by XRD and the results of XPS and Raman measurements
can be due to the way in which the sample for XRD measurements was
collected: each powder sample was collected by scraping the surface
of the CP substrates. In this way, the phase that was more strongly
anchored to the substrate was underestimated.

Deposits obtained on FTO, after annealing at 250 °C
for 1
h, show only the presence of the Ag2V4O11 phase, suggesting that this substrate favors the formation
of such phases.

The presence of the Ag2V4O11 as
the main component is confirmed by TEM images. In fact, as reported
in the literature, Ag2V4O11 crystals
are commonly found with a nanostripe or needle shape, as can be clearly
seen in the images reported in Figure 3.10 In Figure 3b, the Ag2V4O11 needles can be clearly seen together on a GO
sheet with typical wrinkles. The same crystalline shape is also found
in the sample without GO. The darker spots correspond to metallic
Ag nanoparticles and Ag3VO4, whose presence
is also confirmed in the UV–vis spectra obtained on FTO glass.
In Figure 3c,d, we
report the EDX maps together with the corresponding SEM images acquired
on AgxVOy and
AgxVOy&GO
0.75 mg/mL after electrochemical work. In the case of the material
deposited without GO, it is evident that large needles and stripes
are grown on the CP surface together with smaller particles. However,
when the growth is performed with GO, the dimension of the particles
is more uniform, and “worm-like” structures appear probably
due to the presence of the thin GO blanket. The Ag/V atomic ratio
(which includes metallic Ag) determined by EDX is 3:5 in the case
of AgxVOy and
1:1 for AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL. The UV–visible spectra of AgxVOy and AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL,
grown on FTO and presented in Figure 4, are similar, and the main component, at about 430–450
nm, is overlapping with localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs)
of Ag NPs embedded in the crystalline nanostripes or needles of Ag2V4O11. These resonances are typically
found at about 400 nm in the case of NPs with a diameter of 30–40,
whereas a shift toward a longer wavelength is characteristic of larger
aggregates. The absorption maximum, at 434 nm, due to the presence
of Ag2V4O11 can be seen in the figure
inset, where the UV–vis spectrum of Ag2V4O11 obtained by hydrothermal synthesis and drop-casting
on glass from an ethanol suspension is reported.21 It is important to highlight that the UV–vis spectra
were acquired after running several cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles
(0.0–0.9 V vs SHE) to dissolve most of the metallic Ag.

Figure 3 TEM images
of AgxVOy (a)
and AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL (b). Ag2V4O11 crystals are characterized by the needle-like shape. Darker
spots are due to residual Ag NPs or small amounts of Ag3VO4 (AgxVOy sample). (c, d) SEM images and EDX element maps are reported.
Large needle-like particles are visible for the AgxVOy sample: smaller structures
are found in the case of AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL.

Figure 4 UV–vis spectra of AgxVOy and AgxVOy&GO deposited on FTO. Both spectra have
been obtained after running several CV cycles (0.0–0.9 V vs
SHE) to dissolve most of the metallic Ag. The arrows indicate absorption
due to AgxVOy (430–450 nm) and LSPR of residual Ag NPs (400 nm). In the
inset, the UV–vis spectrum of Ag2V4O11 obtained by hydrothermal synthesis and drop-casting on a
soda-lime glass from an ethanol suspension is reported.

In Figure 5, we
report the Raman spectra obtained for samples deposited on CP and
FTO using AgxVOy&GO precursor solutions with different amounts of GO. The spectra
of the samples with GO, normalized to the intensity of the peak at
840 cm–1 (see below), are characterized by resonance
bands at about 500, 630, 790 (sh), and 840 cm–1,22,23 as well as typical GO-derived D and G bands at about 1350 and 1600
cm–1. The samples prepared from solutions containing
0.40 and 0.75 mg/mL GO are also characterized by a very sharp peak
at 950 cm–1. This last resonance seems to shift
to 930 and 925 cm–1 in the case of samples containing
1.50 mg/mL GO and those without GO, respectively. As a reference,
we also report the Raman spectrum of Ag2V4O11 obtained by hydrothermal synthesis.

Figure 5 Raman spectra of Ag2V4O11 and
of samples containing AgxVOy&GO with various amounts. The spectra are normalized
to the intensity at 840 cm–1 (excluding the sample
containing 1 mg/mL GO). An offset is applied to the spectra for clarity.
The Raman spectra acquired after the electrochemical measurements
are reported as gray dotted lines.

There is a rather reliable correlation between V–O
bond
distances, bond orders, and Raman stretching frequencies, as very
well clarified in the literature.24−26 The Raman spectra of
α-Ag3VO4 characterized by one single band
at about 800 cm–1 and that of Ag4V2O7 by three bands at 830, 790, and 770 (sh) cm–1 are typical of tetrahedral and 5-fold coordinated
vanadates.14,27 In contrast, the higher number
of bands found in the spectra of the deposited samples (500, 630,
790, 840, and 950 cm–1) correlates well with octahedrally
coordinated vanadate species. The very intense feature at 950 cm–1 matches nicely with a V–O distance of about
1.6 Å and a bond order of about 1.65–1.7. These bond lengths
and the corresponding Raman frequencies are typical of octahedrally
coordinated vanadium oxides containing polyanions like V2O62– or V10O286–. In fact, there are silver vanadates, known
as Ag-vanadate bronzes, that are structures deriving from β-Ag4V4O12. The structure of Ag4V4O12 consists of infinite chains with the
formula [V4O12]n.18,28 These chains, of a zigzag shape, are double
and consist of an edge sharing VO6 distorted octahedra
with the V–O bonds distributed in four domains, with the shortest
one, a vanadyl bond, equal to 1.67 Å. As well described in ref (18), the conversion of β-Ag4V4O12 to AgxV2O10 is possible by eliminating crystallographic
shear (CS) planes of Ag2O and O2 according to
the following reaction:  The elimination of Ag2O is also
in agreement with the high amount of metallic Ag according to WAXD
and XPS measurements, because Ag2O can easily decompose
to O2 and Ag above 160 °C. It is worth noting that
the peaks at 500 and 950 cm–1 together with the
large structure between 750 and 880 cm–1 are clearly
visible in the Raman spectrum of Ag2V4O11 obtained by hydrothermal synthesis10 and reported in Figure 5. Therefore, Raman spectra indicate that the deposits are
mainly composed of Ag2V4O11 and a
smaller amount of Ag3VO4 (band at 790–800
cm–1). The presence of a G-band at 1353 cm–1 and a D-band at about 1600 cm–1 is indicative
of multilayer GO aggregates.29 A final
comment regards the spectra acquired after electrochemical measurements
and therefore without the embedded metallic Ag NPs (see the following
section). These spectra are reported in Figure 5 as gray dotted lines. The main difference
with the spectra acquired before the electrochemical measurements
is the intensity of the band at about 790 cm–1 in
the case of the pure AgxVOy sample and the intensity of the bands at 950 and
500 cm–1 in the case of the sample containing GO.
We attribute this difference to the SERS effect due to the presence
of Ag NPs. The sample containing GO also showed a pronounced leaching
of the deposit as evidenced by the low intensity of the D and G bands
due to GO. Finally, the Raman spectra of the deposits obtained on
FTO are very similar to the ones obtained on CP (blue and dark green
curves in Figure 5)
and correspond to the Ag2V4O11 phase.

In conclusion of the whole set of physicochemical characterizations,
we have strong evidence for the prevalent presence of Ag2V4O11 species in the deposited films. In the
following section, we will assume such a hypothesis when discussing
the PEC measurements.

Mott–Schottky Plots, PEC Measurements,
and Electrochemical
Sensing of Ethylenediamine
The idea behind the use of Ag-vanadates
as electrochemical sensors for the detection of amines is that this
material is characterized by (1) surface sites that are effective
for the adsorption of N atoms through nonbonded electron pairs (Ag–O
sites), (2) a certain number of surface sites at which anodic discharge
of water, with the generation of OH radicals, occurs at sufficiently
low overpotentials (usually metal oxides or composites of metal oxides)
and a good stability at alkaline pH. The mechanism proposed in the
literature for the oxidative detection of aliphatic amines, according
to the above-mentioned requisites, is the following30      where S[OH] indicates a surface site where
the anodic discharge of water occurs and S′[R] a site where
ammines are adsorbed by lone-pair donation.

To these requirements,
we can add that of stable n-type conductivity, so that the increase
in the anodic current under illumination can improve the sensitivity.
In this paragraph, we will, therefore, verify first the possibility
of using this material as a photoanode with the production of a sufficiently
stable photocurrent. Then, we will also consider the effect of the
addition of GO on the photoactive properties of the Ag-vanadates.
Finally, we will present the electrochemical detection of ethylenediamine
in the dark as well as under illumination.

The Mott–Schottky
plots obtained from pure AgxVOy and AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL
samples are reported in Figure 6. They present a typical positive slope characteristic of
an n-type behavior. The imperfect linear shape of the plot might be
due to the presence of different phases, as already indicated by the
Raman and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, which can provide different
electronic properties in the synthesized materials under polarization
conditions. The flat-band position is about 0.95 V. The n-type conductivity
is somewhat surprising and opposite to what is usually expected in
the case of typical photocatalysts such as Ag3VO4 or Ag4V2O7. In particular, α-Ag3VO4, the stable phase at room temperature, is expected
to be a p-type semiconductor according to the theoretical predictions
and confirmed by optical and electrical measurements, because the
energy of formation of oxygen vacancies is high and oxygen vacancies
do not compensate for the Ag cation vacancies. As a result, holes
are formed and therefore Ag-vanadates are usually characterized by
a p-type conductivity.11,31,32 Danzhen Li,33 who synthesized Ag4V2O7 by a hydrothermal procedure at
low pH (between 4 and 6), obtained a p-type behavior as well, caused
by Ag vacancies in the lattice with quite good photocatalytic performances
under visible light. Mullins and co-workers prepared Ag3VO4 thin films by SILAR obtaining an n-type conductivity
after a mild annealing of the deposit at temperatures slightly higher
than 150 °C. They measured an increase in the anodic photocurrent
up to annealing temperatures of 300 °C, but with a very quick
decay of it after only 30 s. This decay was also accompanied by a
shift of the flat-band potential to more positive values. The authors
concluded that the high values of the initial photocurrents were actually
due to the removal of oxygen vacancies created by the annealing procedure.11 An n-type conductivity was instead found in
the case of AgxV2O5 vanadate bronzes.34 In our case, the
main component is Ag2V4O11, especially
in the case of samples containing GO, and we can say that this type
of vanadate is characterized by an n-type conductivity and by a lower
band gap (1.88–2.0 eV)35,21 compared with the values
found in the literature for Ag3VO4 and other
vanadates (α-Ag3VO4: 2.4–2.2 eV;
β-Ag3VO4: 2.67 eV; Ag4V2O7: 2.4 eV; and AgVO3: 2.5 eV).4,36

Figure 6 Mott–Schottky
plots of samples obtained from AgxVOy and AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL
solutions.

In Figure 7, we
report typical photocurrent responses of samples obtained from AgxVOy and AgxVOy&GO with
increasing amounts of GO. All of the samples are characterized by
an n-type conductivity, and the obtained current density values in
a 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (pH = 8.3) are all between about
60 and 20 μA/cm2 at 1.30 V versus SHE with the onset
just below 1.20 V, as reported in Figure 7.

Figure 7 (a) Photocurrent of samples obtained from pure
AgxVOy solution
and AgxVOy&GO at different
concentrations at 1.3 V vs SHE. (b) Photocurrent vs GO concentrations
at different voltages. The renormalized photocurrent values (see text)
expressed as μA/(cm2 mg Ag2V4O11) can be obtained by multiplying for a conversion factor
= 0.195 C/mg Ag2V4O11 (C stays for
coulomb).

The rather slow increase of the
photocurrent by illuminating the
sample is due to the morphology of the deposit on the CP, which is
also found in other cases.37 In any case,
the addition of 0.25 mL of pure methanol in the electrolytic solution
(total volume 50 mL) did not show any clear increase of the photocurrent
and therefore we think that the hole mobility is rather small, as
already verified by Mullins and co-workers.11 The effect of the addition of GO to the precursor solution was verified
by normalizing the photocurrent (recorded at 1.20, 1.25, and 1.30
V vs SHE) to the amount of Ag (as Ag+ in the vanadate)
contained in each sample. The amount of Ag+, after stripping
the metallic Ag by applying several CV cycles between 0.0 and 0.9
V, was obtained dissolving the deposit by dropping a concentrated
NH3 solution (≈1 mL) on the CP filter and rinsing
with 50 mL of 0.1 M KHCO3 solution. The same solution was
then used to redeposit metallic Ag NPs on a new CP filter and finally
re-dissolving them by performing a CV between 0.0 and 0.9 V. This
procedure allows only the determination of a charge proportional to
the amount of Ag+ in the sample. It is also important to
notice that the amount of metallic Ag contained in the deposit, as
shown by XPS and WAXD measurements, is completely dissolved as soon
as potentials above 0.5 V versus SHE are applied. To be sure that
each sample was free from metallic Ag, several CV cycles were performed
(between 0.0 and 0.9 V) before photocurrent determination. Under these
conditions, with a pH solution of 8.3, no precipitation of Ag2O or Ag2CO3 on the carbon fibers can
occur.a In conclusion, the amount of Ag+ determined as described above corresponds only to the Ag+ ions contained in the vanadate. The results of this normalization
procedure are reported in Figure 7, wherein it is clear that the best compromise is obtained
by using the solution containing 0.75 mg/mL of GO.

The effect
of GO on the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode
interface can be evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements obtained on a pure AgxVOy sample and on the one containing
0.75 mg/mL of GO. The Nyquist plots reported in Figure 8 indicate that, apart from the lower resistance
of the sample containing GO, the pure AgxVOy has a capacitive behavior with a
very high resistance.

Figure 8 Fitted Nyquist plots of the samples prepared from pure
AgxVOy solution
and
AgxVOy&GO
0.75 mg/mL.

In Figure 9, we
show the Bode plot obtained from 104 to 10–1 Hz. The EIS spectra show two time constants, differing in the frequency
domain, wherein higher frequencies can be assigned to the double-layer
capacitance/charge transfer resistance system, in series with a capacitance/resistance
corresponding with the electronic transfer of a thicker inner layer.
It is evident that the polarization resistance of the sample containing
GO is about two-thirds of that containing pure AgxVOy (resistance extracted from
the Bode plot at the lowest frequency).

Figure 9 Simulated EIS spectrum
of the samples prepared from AgxVOy, (a) and AgxVOy&GO 0.75
mg/mL (b) and simulation models.

We have simulated the EIS measurements with equivalent circuits,
as reported in Figure 9. In the simulation, R0 represents the
solution resistance. Y1 and R1 represent the charge transfer process between the film
and the electrolyte within the double layer on the electrode, whereas Y2 and R2 represent
the capacity and resistance of the film. In both time constants, capacitances
were substituted by constant phase elements (CPEs). To take into account
their nonideal character,38 the Brug equation39 was used to convert CPE into capacitances. The
obtained values are, in the case of the pure oxide: Cfilm = 1.97 mF, CDL = 215
μF, whereas in the case of the AgxVOy&GO composite: Cfilm = 398 μF, CDL =
485 μF. The film resistance (R2)
reduces from 130 to 28 kΩ after the introduction of GO. Therefore,
the better performance in terms of electronic transfer obtained for
the samples containing GO can be associated with a better electrical
conductivity of the deposit that shows the presence of a higher amount
of Ag2V4O11, characterized by n-type
electrical conductivity,28 as indicated
by Raman and XRD spectra. For now, we can simply associate a lower
resistance and a more efficient charge injection on the electrode
surface with the presence of GO. It is worth pointing out that the
two best performing samples are those that, according to Raman spectra
and XRD, show also the highest amount of Ag2V4O11, whereas samples containing 1.5 and 3 mg/mL GO present
a less intense band at 950 cm–1, which we consider
as representative of the presence of short V–O bonds. Therefore,
it appears that a proper ratio between GO and AgxVOy/NH3 solution
is crucial in favoring the formation of these compounds. To our best
knowledge, in the literature there is another example of composite
AgxVO4&GO obtained by simply mixing preformed
Ag3VO4 and GO, which does not show the formation
of any Ag2V4O11 phase.14

As stated in the introduction, Ag2V4O11 is a versatile vanadate and its
use as a sensor in the detection
of amines and ethanol in the gas phase has already been tested.10 The detection of amines in a water solution,
especially biogenic amines, is also an important task. The detection
of biogenic amines and, in particular, histamine by electrochemical
methods requires the use of polycrystalline boron-doped diamond thin-film
electrodes, gold nanocrystal-modified glassy carbon electrodes, or
thin-film Ni electrodes, as described in refs (40, 41). In our case, the electrode can be prepared
in a few minutes and therefore can be considered as an interesting
alternative to the methods mentioned above. Ethylenediamine (EDA)
is chemically similar to biogenic amines but easier to handle and
can be used as a tester for biogenic amines.

In Figure 10, we
show the response of the AgxVOy/CP sample to the addition of small amounts
(200 μL) of 0.01 M EDA solution in 0.1 M KHCO3, by
reporting the current at 1.15 V versus SHE (the peak corresponds to
the oxidation of the amine41,42) as a function of the
EDA concentration. The electrode showed a good sensitivity to the
addition of EDA with a linear range between about 50 and 300 μm
concentrations. The detection limit, calculated in the response linear
range, considering ΔI as 3 times the standard
deviation in the nonfaradic region, was about 0.2 ppm. This value
is comparable to other literature data.40,43 Slightly worse
results are obtained for the nanocomposite with GO (Figure 10c). In this case, the linear
range is also lower than in the case of AgxVOy as well as the detection limit. This
behavior indicates that the linear range and the response of the electrode
strongly depend on the amount of the deposited catalyst (the amount
of AgxVOy is
less in the case of samples containing GO, as discussed above in this
section) and possibly by the presence of GO sheets, which prevents
the adsorption of the amines on the vanadate surface.

addition of 200 μL of 0.01 M EDA
solution. (b) AgxVOy response to the addition of 200 μL of 0.01 M EDA

The current values at 1.15 V vs SHE are reported in the figure insets
as a function of the EDA concentration. The bottom LVS curve (red)
is the electrode response before EDA addition. The calculated detection
limit, considering ΔI = 3σ, where σ
is the standard deviation calculated in the nonfaradic region, is
0.2 ppm in the case of AgxVOy. The dotted curve (a) is the response of a clean
CP electrode in the same solution after 10 EDA additions (3.8 ×
10–4 M). (e) CV on a freshly prepared AgxVOy sample in KHCO3 solution.

It must be noted that
before performing a sensing measurement,
each electrode must be “activated” by applying some
CV cycles between 0.0 and 0.9 V versus SHE to strip the amount of
metallic Ag (in the form of Ag NPs) that forms during the deposition
process (see XRD and XPS characterization) and after exposure of the
electrode to light for a few hours. The accumulation of Ag NPs on
the surface of Ag-vanadates is well documented and was observed also
in the case of Ag2V4O11 crystals
by HR-TEM measurements.17 Considering the
good photoactivity of the films, as described in the previous part
of this section (n-type behavior and stable photocurrents up to 1.30
V vs SHE), we carried out the sensing experiments also on a AgxVOy film under illumination
(Figure 10b). As clearly
visible from Figure 10b, when the sensing is performed under illumination, the increase
in the anodic current (the onset of the photocurrent is above 1.0
V) corresponds to a higher slope of the linear range of the electrode,
and this allows a lower detection limit (≈0.1 ppm). The linear
range is slightly lower than that in the previous case probably because
of the formation of Ag NPs induced by the light as testified by the
appearance of a weak anodic current at about 0.65 V (Figure 10b). As mentioned above, although
the presence of GO improves the photocurrent values, considering the
value normalized to the Ag-vanadate content, the sensing efficiency
depends instead on the absolute amount of Ag-vanadate and therefore
when the sensing experiment is performed using the AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL
sample (Figure 10d),
the performances are only slightly better than those obtained under
dark conditions (higher slope value in the linear range) and in any
case comparable to those obtained with the pure AgxVOy sample in the dark.

Conclusions
A quick and easy synthesis of AgxVOy and AgxVOy/GO thin films or nanoaggregates was obtained
by aerosol-assisted deposition. The deposition process that allows
us to obtain a ready-to-work electrode can be completed in a few minutes,
at difference with the more standard, hydrothermal synthesis, which
requires a heat treatment in a closed vessel at 180 °C for about
48 h. The obtained deposit adheres well on CP or FTO and does not
require the addition of nafion to prevent material loss during the
electrochemical measurements. The precursor solution consisted of
an alkaline solution (NH4OH) containing Ag, V, and O with
a Ag/V atomic ratio of 3:1. Different amounts of GO flakes were added
to the precursor solution to study the effect of GO on the physicochemical
and electrochemical properties of the Ag-vanadate film.

The
sample prepared without GO consisted of a mix of Ag2V4O11 and α-Ag3VO4 phases
with a large particle size distribution. The addition of
GO resulted in a significant increase of the Ag2V4O11/α-Ag3VO4 ratio and a more
homogeneous dispersion of the Ag2V4O11 nanoparticles on the GO sheets. This material was characterized
by a stable n-type conductivity. The presence of GO led to the improvement
of the electrical conductivity of the film by assisting the electron
injection on the electrode surface.

The AgxVOy samples deposited on CP
without and with GO were finally tested
as electrochemical sensors for amine detection in solution. The electrodes
showed a good sensitivity to the amine with a linear range between
about 50 to 300 μm concentrations and with a detection limit
of about 0.2 ppm. A lower detection limit could be obtained by performing
the sensing measurements under illumination.

Experimental Section
Aerosol-Assisted
Deposition
The precursor solution
containing Ag, V, and O in the stoichiometric amount (3Ag/V), named
throughout the text as AgxVOy solution, was prepared according to the following
reactions:    V2O5 (4.0269 g, 22.1
mmol) and NaOH (5.3137 g, 133 mmol) were dissolved in deionized (DI)
water (15 mL) to obtain a Na3VO4 solution. AgNO3 (22.5581 g, 133 mmol) was dissolved in water (20 mL). Then,
both solutions were mixed together and stirred for 15 min to induce
the precipitation of Ag3VO4 (or other Ag-vanadates).
Finally, a concentrated (35% weight) NH4OH solution was
added dropwise until a clear solution (AgxVOy, 100 mg/mL) was obtained. Lyophilized
GO obtained by the Hummers method was dissolved in milli-Q water to
obtain a solution with a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Then, 5 AgxVOy solutions (5.0
mg/mL) with variable GO contents (0, 0.40, 0.75, 1.50, and 3.00 mg/mL)
were prepared (AgxVOy&GO).

A commercial medical ultrasonic aerosol
generator was used to deposit the composite on a 15 mm round CP (Toray,
TGP-H-60) or on FTO (Aldrich, 7 Ω/sq). Volumes of 4 mL of the
AgxVOy&GO
solutions and 2 mL of concentrated NH4OH were mixed together
and then introduced in the aerosol generator. The resulting vapor
was directed by an air stream (flow rate = 60 mL/min) on the CP substrate,
which was kept at 250 °C throughout the deposition. The samples
were named AgxVOy, AgxVOy&GO
0.4 mg/mL, AgxVOy&GO 0.75 mg/mL, AgxVOy&GO 1.50 mg/mL, and AgxVOy&GO 3.00 mg/mL according to the
content of GO in the precursor solution. The procedure followed to
deposit AgxVOy and AgxVOy&GO on FTO was the same but the substrate was kept at 270 °C.

Material Characterization
The nano- and micro-scale
morphology of the materials was studied by field electron gun (FEG)
SEM, using a Zeiss Supra 35 VP equipment. Micrographs were taken with
an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and using an in-lens high-resolution
detector. EDX analysis was performed on the same machine with an accelerating
voltage of 10 kV. For TEM analysis, the samples were embedded in acrylic
resin LRW and allowed to polymerize O.N. at 60 °C. The samples
were cut with an LKB ultramicrotome, and 100 nm thick slices were
deposited on 200 mesh copper grids. The observation was made by a
TEM FEI Tecnai G12 operating at 100 kV. The images were acquired with
an OSIS Veleta camera.

XPS measurements were performed on a
custom-built UHV chamber (base pressure = 5 × 10–10 mbar) equipped with a nonmonochromatized double-anode X-ray source
(Omicron DAR-400), a hemispherical electron analyzer (Omicron EA-125),
and a 5-channeltrons detection assembly. The electron analyzer acceptance
angle was ± 4°, and the diameter of the analyzed area was
3 mm. The spectra were acquired with Al Kα radiation. The binding
energy scale was calibrated with respect to the Pt 4f7/2, and all reported spectra intensities were obtained after a Shirley
background subtraction.

WAXD patterns were recorded in the diffraction
angular range of
10–50° 2θ by a Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer,
working in the reflection geometry and equipped with a graphite monochromator
on the diffracted beam (Cu Kα radiation)

Raman spectra
were acquired with a ThermoFisher DXR Raman microscope
using a 532 nm laser (5 mW), focused on the sample with a 50×
objective (Olympus) obtaining a spot size of about 1 μm. UV–vis
spectra were acquired in the absorbance mode on a UV–vis Cary
5E spectrophotometer.

All of the electrochemical measurements
were obtained in 0.1 M
KHCO3 solution in a three-electrode electrochemical cell
controlled by Autolab PGSTAT204. The Pt electrode and saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode,
respectively. PEC measurements were done by visible light LED sources
controlled by the optical bench (Metrohm-Autolab) coupled to the Autolab
PGSTAT204. All of the potentials mentioned in this article are referred
to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). EIS data were obtained at
the open circuit potential of the samples in the cell without light.
The amplitude for EIS measurements is ±10 mV, and the frequency
range was set from 104 to 10–1 Hz performing
10 points per decade. Stability tests (1 h) were conducted by setting
the potential from 0.55 to 1.30 V with linear steps of 50 mV under
visible light illumination. Then, the values at 1.20–1.30 V
were collected to estimate the stability of the prepared samples.
The electrochemical detection of EDA was performed in a 0.1 M KHCO3 solution by linear sweep voltammetry scans with several additions
of 200 μL of 0.01 M EDA solutions and using an SCE reference
electrode and a glassy carbon counter electrode to prevent eventual
dissolution of Pt and redeposition of Pt NPs on the working electrode.44 The scan rate was 0.05 V/s.

a In a 0.1 M
KHCO3 solution
(pH = 8.3), where the CO32– concentration
is about 10–3 M, the precipitation of Ag2CO3 occurs for [Ag+] higher than 10–4 M. The stripping of metallic Ag, as deduced from the CV data, always
leads to [Ag+] ≤ 6 × 10–6 M. Similar considerations can be applied considering the formation
of Ag(OH) and Ag2O.
