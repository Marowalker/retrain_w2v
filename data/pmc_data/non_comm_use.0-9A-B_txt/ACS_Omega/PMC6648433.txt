Planar and lithography-free
metal–insulator–metal
(MIM) resonators based on the Fabry–Pérot etalon are
attractive for biochemical sensing applications because of their acceptable
optical performance and cost-effectiveness. However, injecting analytes
into the insulating layer where the optical field is localized (high
light–matter interaction) is difficult. Here, planar and lithography-free
MIM resonators interacting with their environment are reported. In
the MIM, molecules of a liquid can infiltrate the inherent nanopores
in the deposited silver nanomembrane and be absorbed into the silk
protein hydrogel membrane. The silk layer is swollen when water molecules
are absorbed, inducing a large shift in the resonance wavelength.
Thus, in this study, the proposed MIM resonator was applied as a highly
sensitive water sensor, and a water content as low as 0.008% in organic
solvents could be determined by reading the shift in the transmission
peak. This limit can be lowered further by using a high-resolution
spectrometer and a thicker silk layer. In addition, the area of interaction
can be artificially selected by applying an elastomer stamp and a
patterned photoresist window.

Introduction
Fabry–Pérot
(FP) optical cavities are widely used
in optoelectronic devices such as filters, coating, and spectrometers.1−3 The FP cavity can be easily formed by using two highly reflective
metallic films sandwiching a lossless dielectric layer having at least
a quarter-wavelength thickness; this construction is a so-called metal–insulator–metal
(MIM) resonator.4,5 Although the ultrathin metallic
layers are optically slightly lossy, strong light localization can
be induced inside the dielectric layer, and this results in efficient
color filtering and absorption.6−8 Recently, the study of planar
and lithography-free MIM resonators has been revived because of their
advantages, including cost-effective fabrication and optical performance
comparable to those of other complicated optical resonators.6,9,10 The advantages of planar and
lithography-free MIM resonators make them particularly suitable for
chemical and biological sensing applications.4,5,11,12 However, in
a conventional MIM resonator, it is hard for analytes to exert an
influence on the optical mode because the resonators are composed
of rigid materials, and there is no way for the analytes to be absorbed
into the dielectric layer where the optical field is strongly localized.6 Therefore, the use of a soft dielectric layer
that can absorb the analytes, as well as mirror layers with channels
for analyte penetration, is necessary.

Mechanical stability,
optical transparency, and biocompatibility
are traits of silk protein that make it an attractive material for
use in bio- and nano-optical devices.13−17 The good optical properties of silk protein make
it more desirable than conventional dielectric materials for engineering
biocompatible optical devices.18,19 Thus, many silk-based
optical structures have been actively used to obtain reflectors, lasers,
and color filters.4,17,20,21 In addition, composites of noble metals
and silk nanostructures impart biocompatibility and a strong optical
response.4,22−24 Facile intermolecular
cross-linking by water vapor or organic solvent treatment creates
nanochannels in the hydrogel, and these nanochannels facilitate the
detection and quantification of the analytes in aqueous solutions.4,22−24 Furthermore, the hydratable silk hydrogel allows
the interaction of the photonic device with various body fluids in
vivo, making these devices ideal candidates for epidermal and human-implantable
applications.25 The properties of silk
make it suitable as the dielectric layer in MIM-based sensors for
translating the chemical signal to the optical resonance depending
on the operating environment.5

The
detection of traces of water in organic solvents is critical
in the pharmaceutical, biological, and chemical industries, especially
in organic synthesis, because water traces can impede the production
of chemicals and drugs and, in organic solvents, can directly lead
to the failure of organic reactions.26−28 Widely used water detection
methods include Karl Fischer titration29 and chromatography,30 but these are expensive
and require specialized instruments, as well as being time-consuming.
In contrast, optical devices are adaptable water sensors for use in
biological and chemical environments because of their high sensitivity
and the possibility for wireless measurement.31−34 Many spectrometric sensors using
fluorescence, reflectance, and attenuation have been demonstrated
using photonic crystals,35 metal–organic
frameworks,36 fluorescence probes,37 infrared absorbing dyes,38 fiber-optic Bragg gratings,39 and fiber lasers.40 However, these optical
techniques are either complicated to use or not compatible with the
biological environment. As far as chemical sensing in the biological
environment is concerned, the dimensions and biocompatible traits
of the optical device are crucial factors.

Here, we report an
ultrathin, planar, and lithography-free MIM
color filter that can interact with the aqueous environment through
the inherent nanopores in the ultrathin metallic layer. The MIM color
filter was fabricated by sandwiching a silk hydrogel layer between
two planar 30 nm-thick silver (Ag) nanomembranes. The resonance wavelength
can be adjusted by varying the thickness of the intermediate silk
layer. In an aqueous environment, water molecules infiltrate the Ag
layer and swell the silk hydrogel layer, resulting in a huge red shift
in the resonance wavelength. The thickness of the top Ag nanomembrane
is highly related to the infiltration time of the solvent molecules
and the quality (Q) factor of the FP cavity. We applied
our interactive MIM resonator for the detection of minute amounts
of water in organic solvents, such as acetone and isopropyl alcohol
(IPA). The minimum water concentration that induced the 0.36 nm shift
(the resolution limit of the spectrometer) was 0.04% in acetone and
0.008% in IPA, comparable to the most sensitive water sensors. The
experimental results also show that the sensitivity of the proposed
water sensor can be significantly improved when a high-resolution
spectrometer and a thicker silk layer are applied. Because liquids
penetrate the metallic layer of the planar MIM structure, we can choose
any spot on the sensor to induce the color change, and color changes
by selective wetting were observed using a wet or solvent-filled polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) stamp. In addition, the patterned MIM resonator was obtained
by selective cross-linking. The MIM with a planar and ultrathin silk
hydrogel and Ag layers is an intuitive, cost-effective, and highly
sensitive biochemical sensor that can interact with its environment.

Results
and Discussion
MIM resonators were fabricated on a glass
substrate with an interfacial
layer of silk protein between two 30 nm-thick Ag layers (Figure 1a). To induce cross-linking
between the silk molecules, the silk layer was treated with methanol.
The cross-linked silk film became a hydrogel and could swell when
water molecules were absorbed.41 The Ag
layers were deposited by an electron beam evaporation system, and
it is well-known that there are inherent nanopores in deposited noble
metal layers having thicknesses of less than 50 nm.42 Therefore, when the MIM resonator was immersed in an aqueous
solution, water and other small molecules could be absorbed into the
silk layer through the thin Ag layer. This caused the refractive index
(RI) of the hydrogel to be reduced and the thickness to be increased.
Although the reduced RI resulted in the blue shift of the resonant
wavelength, the red shift caused by the increased distance between
two Ag mirrors dominated the change of the resonance, resulting in
a huge red shift (Figures 1b and S1).

Images of the MIM structure in air (dried) and water with the swollen
silk spacer under white light irradiation.

By controlling the thickness of the silk layer, the MIM resonator
could be utilized as a color filter. Finite-difference time domain
(FDTD) simulations were used to find the thickness of the silk layer
(tsilk) for the color filtering. The chosen
thicknesses of the silk layer to exhibit color filtering in the blue,
green, and red regions were 90, 120, and 150 nm, respectively. With
the increase of tsilk, the resonance wavelength
was red-shifted. Figure 2a shows the simulated and measured transmission spectra of the designed
and fabricated MIM resonators in air. The experimental results showed
spectral peaks at 470.1 (blue), 552.4 (green), and 637.3 nm (red)
in the transmission spectra. The small incongruity between the measured
and calculated spectra resulted from fabrication tolerances. In water,
the intermediate silk layers absorbed water molecules and showed resonance
wavelengths red-shifted to 670.9, 764.1, and 865.9 nm (Figure 2b). Our previous study indicated
that the RI of the silk hydrogel was 1.43,17 and the FDTD simulations revealed that the tsilk values of the swollen silk hydrogel layers were expanded
to around 165, 185, and 250 nm from 90, 120, and 150 nm, respectively.
Additionally, for the 250 nm-thick MIM (in water), the second-order
resonance mode came within the detection range of the spectrometer.
The Q factor, which is defined as Q = λpeak/Δλfwhm, was ca.
16, where Δλfwhm is the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the resonance and λpeak is the resonance
wavelength. The acceptable Q factor and the red shift
over 200 nm in the wavelength indicate that the demonstrated MIM is
useful for a remarkable sensor for use in an aqueous medium.

blue, green, and red color filters with tsilk = 90, 120, and 150 nm, respectively. (b) Experimental and simulated
transmission spectra of the MIM color filters in water. Using simulation,
the estimated thicknesses of the swollen silk films were determined
to be 165, 185, and 250 nm for the blue, green, and red color filters,
respectively.

The thin polycrystalline
Ag layer deposited by the vacuum evaporation
method contains nanopores which allow the liquid molecules and ions
to penetrate it. As a consequence of heavy deposition, the size and
the numbers of nanopores are reduced, finally disappearing.42 To investigate the effect of the Ag layer thickness
on the water infiltration, MIM color filters with top Ag layers with
different thicknesses (ttop_Ag = 10, 20,
and 30 nm) were fabricated. In these experiments, the thicknesses
of the bottom Ag layer and the intermediate silk layer were fixed.
A droplet of water was carefully placed on the top Ag layer to avoid
penetration via the edges of the MIM structure (Figure 3a). With increasing thickness of the top
Ag layer, the transmission peaks became blue-shifted, and the Q factors increased because of the increase in the reflection
by the top Ag layer (Figure 3b,c) in both experiment and simulation.

MIM with varying Ag top layer thickness
(10, 20, and 30 nm). (a) Schematic of the water penetration through
the nanoporous top Ag layer. (b) Experimental (solid) and simulated
(dashed) transmission peaks of the color filters with varying Ag top
layer thickness in air and water (c). Time-dependent characteristics
of water diffusion into the MIM with different top Ag layer thicknesses:
(d) 10, (e) 20, and (f) 30 nm.

The diffusion rate of water through nanopores is directly
linked
to the number and size of pores; thus, the diffusion increases with
decreasing ttop_Ag. This can be estimated
by tracing the shift in the transmission spectra. A droplet of water
with 100 μm radius was carefully placed on a spot and was absorbed.
The swollen volume (V) of the silk layer was 2.1
× 10–15 m3. The saturation times
to reach to the fully swollen status were 0.749 (ttop_Ag = 10 nm), 4.172 (ttop_Ag = 20 nm), and 6.109 s (ttop_Ag = 30
nm) (Figure 3d–f),
which increased with increasing ttop_Ag. Using the experimental data, we could estimate the water permeability
of the Ag nanomembrane deposited on the silk layer using Darcy’s
law,43 as shown in eq 1. 1  Here, K denotes the permeability
of the Ag nanomembrane, and ΔP is the pressure
difference across the membrane depending on the gravitational force
(mg) of the 1 M water per cross-sectional area (A) of flow. ΔL is the thickness of
the nanomembrane, and η is the viscosity of 1 M water. The mass
of the water (m) is obtained by multiplying the density
(ρ) by volume (V), and g is
the gravitational acceleration. F is the flow rate
across the Ag nanomembrane, measured by dividing the swelled volume
of silk by the diffusion time. We obtained permeabilities of 2.3 ×
10–6 m2 (ttop_Ag = 10 nm), 8.2 × 10–7 m2 (ttop_Ag = 20 nm), and 8.4 × 10–7 m2 (ttop_Ag = 30 nm). Thus,
the increasing thickness of the Ag layer results in the decreasing
permeability of the nanomembrane.

In addition, the effect of
the nanopores on the FP resonance was
investigated using FDTD simulations. For all thicknesses of the top
Ag layer (10, 20, and 30 nm), a single nanopore with different diameters
or a varying number of 10 nm-diameter nanopores was added to the top
Ag layer in the simulated unit cell (Figures S2 and S3). The simulations reveal that the nanopores had no influence
on the FP resonance. Additional resonances can arise when the size
of the nanopore is comparable to the dimensions of the FP cavity (Figure S4). Therefore, the ultrathin and polycrystalline
Ag layer acts as a nanochannel for the liquid molecules, as well as
acting as a reflective mirror to form the FP cavity at the same time.

In our previous study, we proved that the swelling ratio of the
silk hydrogel layer was related to the water content of organic solvents.17 Because the Ag layer of our MIM resonator acts
as a nanochannel connecting the silk layer and the environment, the
MIM device is attractive as a highly sensitive water sensor. MIM resonators
with three tsilk values [90 (blue), 120
(green), and 150 nm (red color filter)] were immersed in 50 mL of
acetone or IPA solutions, and a small amount of water was added to
the organic solvent. As shown in Figure 4, the resonance wavelengths were red-shifted
with increasing water content because the silk layer was expanded
by the absorbed water. For the blue and green color filters, the resonance
wavelength shows a steplike shift because the minimum resolution of
the spectrometer is 0.36 nm. This indicates that the sensitivity of
the MIM-based water sensor can be improved by using a high-resolution
spectrometer. The minimum water contents required to induce the 0.36
nm shift were 70 μL (0.14%), 50 μL (0.10%), and 20 μL
(0.04%) for the blue, green, and red color filters in acetone, respectively
(Figure 4a–c).
Interestingly, in IPA, the minimum water content was reduced to 6
μL (0.012%) for the blue and green color filters and 4 μL
(0.008%) for the red color filter (Figure 4d–f). This means that the same MIM
color filter becomes a more sensitive water sensor in IPA. Previously,
we observed that some organic solvents attract water molecules in
solvent mixtures, and the strength of the attraction depends on the
polarity of the solvent.4 IPA is a weaker
attractor than acetone, so water molecules can expand the silk layer
more easily in IPA. Additionally, as the thickness of the silk layer
increases, the water sensor becomes more sensitive because the wavelength
shift by swelling is increasing with increasing tsilk when we consider that the swelling ratio is similar
for all tsilk. Our device has a better
limit of detection (LOD) than those of fluorescence-based sensors
(0.20 and 0.09% LOD in acetone and IPA).37 Although more sensitive water sensors have been demonstrated using
an infrared absorbing dye (0.0001% LOD in IPA)38 and a Cd-based metal–organic framework (0.0078%
LOD in IPA),36 our device is still attractive
because the LOD can be improved by using a high-resolution spectrometer
and thicker silk layer, and there is no need to use an additional
pigment, which could contaminate the organic solvent.

in 50 mL acetone and IPA solutions.

An advantage of our interactive
MIM-based sensor is that any spot
on the vast Ag plain can be chosen for sensing. Figure 5a shows a schematic of the selective wetting
of the MIM-based sensor. A PDMS stamp with letters was fabricated
and placed on the top Ag layer after wetting each letter with water,
IPA, or acetone, thus allowing the solvents to infiltrate the attached
areas only. Under white light illumination, a change in color was
only observed for the water-wet letter, whereas no significant change
in color was observed for the IPA-wet and acetone-wet areas. The measured
transmission spectra confirmed these observations (Figure 5b). Very small blue shifts
could be observed for the IPA and acetone because of the reduced RI
of the insulator layer by the absorbed solvents. This shows that any
solvent can pass through the nanopores and that diffusion through
the lateral direction by capillary effect is negligible (Figure S5).

The solvent infiltrating
property makes it possible to generate
a patterned MIM resonator by selective cross-linking. First, the MIM
with the amorphous silk layer was fabricated and, then, a photoresist
(PR) was spin-coated on the MIM. The mask was illuminated with UV
light through a mask with square patterns, and the PR was developed
to remove the exposed (positive-tone PR) or unexposed (negative-tone
PR) PR area (Figure 5c,d,f). Subsequently, the PR-coated MIM was exposed to methanol to
induce the cross-linking of the silk layer through the opened region.
Finally, we put the MIM in an ultrasonic water bath for 30 s. In this
process, the non-cross-linked region was removed because the amorphous
silk was selectively dissolved in water. For the negative PR and positive
PR, the square-patterned color filters were successfully generated
and showed the transmission peaks in air and water (Figure 5e,g).

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated an interactive, planar, lithography-free,
and cost-effective MIM color filter using a silk hydrogel sandwiched
between two Ag nanomembranes. The inherent nanopores in the Ag nanomembranes
allowed liquid molecules to infiltrate and be absorbed by the silk
layer where the optical field is highly localized. The silk hydrogel
is swollen by water molecules, resulting in a huge shift in the FP
resonance wavelength. FDTD simulations were carried out to design
and estimate the resonance behaviors in different environments. We
applied the MIM color filters for the highly sensitive water sensor.
Traces of water in acetone and IPA could be determined by reading
the wavelength shift of the FP mode. Additionally, selective wetting
was carried out by means of a PDMS stamp and a PR window to channel
solvents to the desired area. Thus, applying silk protein to a MIM
resonator provides a new way to make the planar resonator that is
in contact with its environment, which will be useful for biochemical
sensor applications.

Methods
Preparation of Silk Aqueous
Solution
Bombyx mori cocoons
were boiled in a 0.02 M Na2CO3 solution for
45 min to remove the sericin protein.
Subsequently, the obtained silk fibroin was washed with distilled
(DI) water and air-dried for 24 h. Then, silk fibroin was dissolved
in a 9.3 M LiBr solution at 60 °C for 4 h to yield 20 wt % silk
solution. The silk/LiBr solution was further dialyzed at room temperature
for 48 h by means of a dialysis membrane (CelluSep T1, MWCO 3.5k,
Membrane Filtration Products) to obtain a 6 wt % silk solution. Furthermore,
the silk solution was purified by centrifugation twice at 9000 rpm
at −1 °C, followed by filtration with a 0.45 μm-pore
syringe filter.

Fabrication of MIM Resonators
The
MIM color filters
were generated on a quartz substrate. The top (10, 20, and 30 nm)
and bottom (30 nm) Ag layers were deposited by electron beam evaporator
(SEE-7, ULTECH). The silk solution was diluted with DI water to 4.5
wt %. The silk fibroin solution was spin-coated using a spin coater
(ACE-200, Dong Ah Trade Corp) to obtain silk films having thicknesses
of 90, 120, and 150 nm on the bottom Ag layer by controlling the spinning
speed to 4200, 3700, and 3200 rpm, respectively. To make the silk
hydrogel, the samples were immersed in methanol and dried in air.
Afterward, the top Ag layer was deposited on the hydrated insulating
silk layer.

PR Window Using Photolithography
Hexamethyldisilazane
was spin-coated at the 2000 rpm on the MIM resonator for the better
adhesion of the PR. Then, hard-baking was carried out at 100 °C
for 120 s. Furthermore, 2 μm-thick positive PR (AZ GXR-601,
AZ Electronic Materials) and negative PR (DNR-L300, Dongjin Semichem
Co., Ltd.) films were spin-coated at 4500 rpm. The samples were soft-baked
at 100 °C for 90 s. A photomask with the square pattern was placed
and aligned on the MIM, which was further exposed to UV light, followed
by treatment with AZ 300MF developer to remove the exposed or unexposed
PR area.

Selective Wetting by PDMS Molds
Liquid PDMS was prepared
by continuous mixing of SYLGARD elastomer base and curing agent (cross-linker)
of 10:1 wt % for 5 min. The prepared mixture was poured onto the mold
and kept at 60 °C for 24 h, which allowed the cross-linking of
the PDMS. The replica mold (stamp) was obtained by peeling off the
PDMS film. Water, acetone, and IPA were added to the embossed feature
of the PDMS stamp using a pipette and placed on the MIM to allow the
solvent molecules to pass through the selectively wet area.

Simulations
The simulated unit cell was set in a three-dimensional
layout and boundary conditions were imposed in the lateral directions.
A simulation unit cell of 1000 nm was selected along the x-axis. A plane-wave source in the range of 300–1000 nm with
2000 frequency points was placed on the top of the MIM device along
the +z direction. The power monitor was placed below
the bottom Ag layer to record transmission. The complex RI of Ag was
obtained from the data of Palik.44 The
RI of silk protein in air was 1.54, whereas that in water was 1.43.
The mesh size for the metallic structure was 10 nm in the x, y, and z directions.
