A phytopathogenic fungus, Macrophomina phaseolina, which infects a wide range
of plants, is an important consideration in agronomy. A jute endophytic
bacterium, Burkholderia contaminans NZ, was found to have a promising effect in controlling the fungus
in in vitro culture conditions. Using the iTRAQ LC-MS/MS method for
quantitative proteomics study, an analysis of the whole proteome of Macrophomina phaseolina with or without B. contaminans NZ challenge identified 2204 different
proteins, of which 137 were found to have significant deviation in
expression. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis
identified most of the upregulated proteins to be functionally related
to energy production (26.11%), as well as defense and stress response
(23.45%), while there was significant downregulation in oxidative
stress protection pathways (42.61%), growth and cell wall integrity
(30.95%), and virulence (23.81%). Findings of this study suggest the
development of a battle when the phytopathogen encounters the bacterium. B. contaminans NZ manages to arrest the growth of
the fungus and decrease its pathogenicity, but the fungus apparently
survives under “hibernating” conditions by upregulating
its energy metabolism. This first ever proteomic study of M. phaseolina will go a long way in understanding
and developing strategies for its effective control.

Introduction
Antagonistic
fungal–bacterial interactions lie at the very heart of competitive
survival for the limited resources in the bio-ecosystem. This paradigm
for existence has been a long-term focus of researchers desperate
for an enhanced understanding of bionetwork functions so as to develop
potent biological control agents against fungal pathogens, providing
alternatives to chemicals for practical agronomic purposes. Numerous
examples highlight the use of bio-control agents in combating fungal
phytopathogens, among them the control of Fusarium by Bacillus in cumin1 and by Pseudomonas putida in tomato2 are two from a list of many recent developments.

With respect to bio-control, some bacteria exhibit antifungal properties
by producing antifungal compounds, secondary metabolites, chitinolytic
enzymes, siderophores, toxins, etc.3,4 Some other
bacteria like B. gladioli exhibit mycophagy
against Rhizoctania solani, that is,
the bacteria grow and multiply at the expense of fungal biomass.4 However, due to the pathogens’ diverse
mechanisms of resistance, an efficient biological arsenal is still
unavailable. Many pathogenic fungi possessing a well-equipped mechanism
for thriving in a competitive environment render themselves almost
invincible to control. They appear to be affected at some point by
the bio-control agents but soon functionalize their genomic resources
to overpower the latter.5 It is therefore
necessary to understand how these pathogens respond in the presence
of bio-control agents. In vitro studies on the antagonism of bacterial
strains against fungal plant pathogens have revealed significant information
on the genes associated and compounds involved.6 Transcriptomic analysis of the phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani AG-3 in response to the antagonistic
bacteria Serratia proteamaculans and Serratia plymuthica(7) and
a dual transcriptional profiling of Collimonas fungivorans versus Aspergillus niger(8) were performed some years ago. These transcriptomic
analyses revealed differential expression of genes related to xenobiotic
degradation, toxin and antioxidant production, carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism, and hyphal rearrangements and genes for production of
putative antifungal compounds. Proteome mapping of an antagonistic F. oxysporum strain proposed candidate proteins that
may play important roles in bio-control and highlight the close interrelationship
between the fungus and its bacterial partners.9

Macrophomina phaseolina, a
phytopathogenic fungus that affects a diverse range of host plants,
poses a major worldwide threat to crop yield.10 Diseases caused by M. phaseolina include
seedling blight, charcoal rot, color rot, stem rot, root rot, and
damping off in more than 500 plant species, among which are economically
important crops like cotton, sorghum, gerbera, soybean, potato, sunflower,
chickpea, and jute, an important fiber-producing crop of Southeast
Asia.11 This fungus is a major growth-limiting
factor of the two most widely cultivated species of jute, Corchorus olitorius and C. capsularis.(12)

A number of reports have been
made on the bio-control of M. phaseolina, some of which include control by Bacillus and Trichoderma in strawberry,13 by Trichoderma in sunflower,14 mung
bean,15 and chickpea, by Trichoderma and Pseudomonas(16) in
gerbera, etc. However, not much is known as to how they impede M. phaseolina from infecting plants or what the molecular
mechanism of the fungal response to inhibition is.

In the present
manuscript, we report the isolation of Burkholderia
contaminans NZ as an endophytic bacterium from jute
(Corchorus olitorius), which inhibits
the growth of M. phaseolina in in vitro
culture conditions. The study attempted to understand the mechanism
of antifungal activity of B. contaminans NZ, and we found that the bacterium does not kill the fungus but
forms and maintains a steady inhibition zone around the fungal mycelia.
These mycelia are even able to germinate when transferred from the
bacteria challenged plate onto fresh medium albeit with loss of pathogenicity.
This bacterium–fungus interaction demonstrates the ability
of M. phaseolina to withstand bacterial
stress and develop strategies to remain static in the face of adversity.

Even with the availability of M. phaseolina genome sequenced in 2012,17 a proteome
study is necessary to understand its response to different stimuli.
We therefore employed a strategy for a relative and absolute quantification
(iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis of M. phaseolina to delineate the changes in the fungal proteome in the presence
of B. contaminans NZ. The iTRAQ technique,
which has a high degree of sensitivity, with amine specific isobaric
reagents permitting identification and quantitation of up to eight
different samples simultaneously,18 was
used to obtain an extensive coverage of the M. phaseolina proteome. In this regard, we have been able to identify up to 82.4%
of the total fungal proteins. A total of 2204 proteins were identified,
of which 137 were found to be differentially regulated upon B. contaminans NZ challenged condition. Interestingly,
most of these proteins with altered expression are related to defense,
virulence, cell proliferation, and cell wall composition together
with the proteins of redox and metabolic pathways.

The ability
of M. phaseolina to remain alive under
inhibitory conditions imposed by B. contaminans NZ points to a distinct phenomenon executed by the phytopathogen.
The fungus upregulates its energy metabolic pathway at the cost of
downregulating the expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress
management and proteins which can lead to pathogenicity. This apparently
allows M. phaseolina to lie torpid
under bacterial inhibition.

Overall, the proteome data of M. phaseolina provide us with important information
as to how the fungus responds to the bio-control environment.

Materials
and Methods
Unless mentioned otherwise, all of the chemicals
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, (St. Louis, MO). Culture media,
Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), and Tryptic Soya Broth (TSB) were obtained
from HiMedia (HiMedia, India). Trypsin (mass spectrometry grade),
RIPA (radioimmune precipitation) lysis and extraction buffer, and
BCA Protein Assay Kit were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Thermo
Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL). iTRAQ 4-plex multiplex kit was purchased
from AB Sciex (Framingham, MA). Protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased
from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN).

In Vitro Dual-Culture Assays
In vitro dual-culture assays were carried out on PDA plates. A
5 mm plug taken from the plate of an actively growing colony of M. phaseolina was inoculated on one side of a Petri
dish. Fresh cells of B. contaminans NZ were streaked in 3 cm length parallel lines on the other side
of the fungal plug. Plates containing only the fungus were also set
up as controls. All plates were incubated at 28 ± 2 °C for
4–5 days.

Photographs of hyphae from both control and B. contaminans NZ challenged fungus were taken using
a fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL, ThermoSci) version 3.6.0 (bright
field, 20×).

Change in Pathogenicity of B. contaminans NZ Challenged M. phaseolina
To assess any changes in fungal pathogenicity, an assay
was performed with jute seeds (Corchorus olitorius var. O4). The seeds were surface-sterilized by treating with 5%
NaOCl for 1 min and then rinsed with autoclaved water three times
for 2 min.19 The seeds were allowed to
germinate on a 110 mm Whatman filter paper (moistened with sterile
water) in Petri plates under two different conditions. In one plate,
1% fungal mycelial solution was inoculated, and in the other, a similar
amount of mycelia from B. contaminans NZ challenged M. phaseolina was used.
A seedling plate without any inoculum was used as the control.

Cell Culture
and Preparation of Protein Extracts
M. phaseolina cells were incubated in 50 mL of PDB for 5 days in an incubator
shaker at 28 °C at 180 rpm; 20 mL of an overnight culture of B. contaminans NZ in TSB was added to 50 mL of 3
day old M. phaseolina culture in PDB.
The fungal mycelia were collected after 2 days of co-culture.

Pure and co-cultured fungal mycelia were filtered and washed three
times with ice-cold 10 mM Na phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) to remove bacterial
contamination and were ground in liquid nitrogen in a precooled mortar.
Crushed fungal cell samples were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer
containing 1× concentration of a protease inhibitor cocktail.
The supernatant was collected following centrifugation and subjected
to three pulses of sonication on ice. Total soluble proteins were
recovered by centrifugation at 14 000g for
30 min at 4 °C, precipitated overnight with 6 volumes of (vol/vol)
ice-cold acetone at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting protein precipitate
was washed twice with cold acetone, air-dried, and stored at −80
°C until use. Semidried pellet was dissolved using 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich).
Total protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein
concentration was calculated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a
standard. Three such experiments were carried out; a total of three
biological and three technical replicates were analyzed for the elucidation
of the differential proteome.

Trypsin Digestion and iTRAQ
Labeling for LC-MS/MS
A total of 100 μg of proteins
from each sample were reduced using 10 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) at
60 °C for 60 min and alkylated using a 20 mM IAA (iodoacetamide)
at room temperature for 30 min. The proteins were then digested overnight
by sequencing-grade trypsin dissolved in 1:20 w/w 50 mM TEAB (triethylammonium
bicarbonate) at 37 °C according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (AB Sciex, Inc.). Then, the peptides from each sample
were first resuspended in 100 mM TEAB and iTRAQ reagents were dissolved
in 70 μL of ethanol by vortexing for 1 min. Peptides from control
and stressed samples were labeled with iTRAQ mass tag 114 and 116,
respectively, at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction was stopped
by adding 120 μL of H2O, followed by centrifugation
at 13 800g for 1 min. The samples were then
pooled together into one fresh tube, as illustrated in Figure 5, and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator.
Except for the iTRAQ labeling, a similar digestion protocol was followed
to prepare fungal protein samples for total protein identification.

Peptide Fractionation by High-pH RP HPLC and LC-MS/MS
Prior
to mass spectrometric analysis, the pooled peptides were resuspended
in 80 μL of buffer A (98% H2O, 2% acetonitrile, pH
10.0) and were fractionated using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system on high-pH
reverse-phase Zorbax 300Extend-C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 3 μm,
150 Å, C18, Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA). The 60 min
linear gradient was composed of 96% buffer A for 1 min; 4–19%
buffer B (98% acetonitrile, 2% H2O, pH 10.0) for 30 min;
then 19–95% buffer B for 23 min, followed by 95% buffer B for
5 min. The eluted fractions were collected at every 1 min interval
into 48 fractions and then pooled to give a total of 12 fractions.
The collected fractions were then lyophilized and stored at −20
°C until MS analysis.

For LC-MS/MS, data were acquired
using 5600 TripleTOF+ (AB Sciex, Concord, Canada). The
instrument was coupled with an Eksigent NanoLC-2DPlus system (Eksigent,
Dublin, CA), and the samples were loaded at a flow rate of 2 μL/min
for 10 min and eluted from the analytical column at a flow rate of
300 nL/min in a linear gradient of 5–35% solvent B in 60 min.
Solvent A was composed of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, and solvent
B contained 95% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The
TripleTOF 5600 system was run on an information-dependent acquisition
(IDA) mode with a TOF/MS survey scan (350–1250 m/z) where the accumulation time was 250 ms. For
fragmentation, a maximum of 10 precursor ions per cycle were selected
with a total cycle time of roughly 2.3 s and each MS/MS spectrum was
collected for 100 ms (100–1500 m/z). The parent ions with a charge state from +2 to +5 were included
for the MS/MS fragmentation. The threshold precursor ion intensity
was set at more than 120 cps (count per second) and was not present
on the dynamic exclusion list. After fragmentation of an ion by MS/MS,
its mass and isotopes were excluded for 10 s. The MS/MS spectra were
operated in high-sensitivity mode with “adjust collision energy”
when using iTRAQ reagent settings.

Protein Identification
and Data Analysis
All of the wiff. files containing MS and
MS/MS spectra generated from Triple TOF 5600 were submitted for database
searching and quantitative analysis using the ProteinPilot v4.5 software
(AB Sciex, Concord, Canada). ProteinPilot search engine was used for
iTRAQ-based quantitation in a data-dependent mode. This search engine
uses a sequence tag method plus protein database searching. Each MS/MS
spectrum was searched against Macrophomina species
from Uniprot/swissprot database (November 28, 2012; 14 056
entries) and against Burkholderia proteins (1 508 793
entries) to distinguish the bacterial proteins from those of the fungus.
The search parameters were set as iTRAQ peptide label, cysteine alkylation
with methyl methanethiosulfonate, trypsin digestion, and identification
focus for biological modifications. The resulting dataset was auto-bias-corrected
to normalize any variation arising from unequal mixing of the differently
labeled samples. False discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using a
target-decoy-based strategy. The proteins and peptides were filtered
with 1% global protein-level FDR. For quantitation, the ratio threshold
was set to >1.3 (equivalent or more than 95% confidence) and p-value < 0.05 to ensure that quantitation was based
on at least two unique peptides. Proteins were considered only if
they were significant in all independent biological and technical
triplicate experiments. The average values of replicates were used
to indicate the final protein abundance at a given time point. The
mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited at the ProteomeXchange
Consortium via the PRIDE20 partner repository
with the dataset identifier PXD009121.

Statistical and Bioinformatics
Analysis
A statistical analysis to compare the groups was
performed using t-test (Sigma Stat, Jandel Scientific).
For functional annotation and cellular location, the protein lists
were analyzed according to the Blast2GO tool (https://www.blast2go.com/),
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Predicted interacting
partners were analyzed using STRING v10 database.21

Results
Effects of B. contaminans NZ on Growth and Morphology of M. phaseolina Mycelium
When M. phaseolina was co-cultured with B. contaminans NZ, a clear inhibition of fungal mycelial
growth was evident at 4 days (Figure 1B) compared to the control without bacteria (Figure 1A). This inhibition
persisted for more than 16 weeks (Figure 1C). Sclerotia collected even from a 3-month-old
confrontation plates were found to retain viability and were able
to germinate when transferred onto a fresh PDA plate. Microscopic
observations of fungal hyphae during interactions with bacteria revealed
a change in the hyphal morphology, including mycelia swelling with
increased septation and branching and thickened cell walls (Figure 2B) compared to the
control hyphae, which were straight having normal branching and septation
(Figure 2A).

Impairment of Pathogenicity in M. phaseolina
When B. contaminans NZ challenged M. phaseolina was used
to inoculate jute seeds, the germinating seedlings looked healthy
(Figure 3C) and were
similar to the ones in which no M. phaseolina was inoculated (Figure 3A). This indicated a significant loss of virulence in the Burkholderia challenged M. phaseolina. However, M. phaseolina without the
stress appeared as virulent as expected with seedlings dying from
heavy infection when inoculated with the same (Figure 3B).

normal growth. Seedlings inoculated with (B) M. phaseolina, where the seedlings are small and brown, indicating heavy infection,
and (C) B. contaminans NZ challenged M. phaseolina. Here, the seedlings are white, long,
and healthy-looking, indicating a loss of pathogenicity of B. contaminans NZ challenged M. phaseolina.

Identification of M. phaseolina Proteome
A total of 2204 proteins
common to the two biological replicates were identified (Figure 4A) (a list of total
identified proteins is available in Supporting Information Table S1). Analysis found M. phaseolina to have a relatively high number of enzymes which belong to hydrolases,
oxidoreductases, and transferases (Figure 4C). Homology-based function prediction was
carried out for M. phaseolina proteome
using Blast2GO. A majority of the proteins was found to belong to
the transport machinery (14%) followed by cellular protein metabolic
process (12%), carboxylic metabolic process (9%), and oxidation–reduction
process (9%) in the category of biological process (Figure 4D). Similarly, the hydrolase
activity (27%) and the oxidoreductase activity (20%) were predicted
in the molecular function category (Figure 4E). Most of the proteins of the cellular
compartment category were found to be localized in the membrane (Figure 4F).

Quantitative Proteomics of M. phaseolina under Bacterial Stress
On
quantitative analysis of M. phaseolina under normal and B. contaminans NZ
stressed conditions (Figure 5A), a total of 47 282 spectra were
obtained from the iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiment. After data filtering
to eliminate low-scoring spectra, a total of 25 429 unique
spectra with 1% false discovery rate (FDR) met the strict confidence
criteria for identification. Raw data showed normal distribution of
relative abundance reflecting the unchanged condition of the majority
of proteins (Figure 5C); data were further normalized using the bias correction feature
of the ProteinPilot v 4.5 software (Figure 5D). Spectral data were searched using Uniprot
decoy database, and proteins with at least two validated peptides
were considered for quantitation. iTRAQ data for all replicates were
found to be similar, suggesting a change in protein abundance in M. phaseolina under B. contaminans NZ stress.

proteomic analysis, (B) table showing the number of modulated proteins
and total identified proteins, (C) histogram displaying log 2
ratios of all proteins, and (D) box plot showing the effect of bias
correction (normalization) based on total reporter ion intensity.

Among the proteins which showed a significant change
(P < 0.05) in abundance, 137 differentially expressed
proteins (DEPs) within the ratio >1.40 or <0.8 under B. contaminans NZ stress were chosen.

Profile of
Differential Protein Abundance
Among the total differentially
abundant proteins in all of the replicates, 95 were found to be upregulated
(Figure 6A) and 42
downregulated (Figure 6B) (lists of upregulated and downregulated proteins are available
in Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4, respectively). A volcano plot was used to show the log 2
ratio of the gene expression levels between the control and stressed
conditions; the colored dots in green and red represent the differentially
abundant proteins. P value <0.01 is represented
by the blue horizontal lines, and 1.4-fold expression difference is
represented by the two red vertical lines (Figure 6C). Cluster analysis based on biological
process revealed that the majority of proteins belong to the metabolic
processes (Figure 6D).

Differentially expressed proteins
of M. phaseolina were further annotated
using Blast2GO. Up (Figure 7A)- and downregulated (Figure 7B) proteins were analyzed separately into three categories
of “molecular function”, “biological process”,
and “cellular component”.

Figure 7 GO-based functional annotation
of (A) upregulated and (B) downregulated proteins.

Functional Classification of Differentially Expressed Proteins
Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of responsive proteins was
further carried out according to the KEGG pathway database. The differentially
abundant proteins were found to be majorly classified into 12 categories
according to their putative biological functions.

Upregulated
DEPs: The majority of upregulated DEPs classified into three categories:
energy and carbohydrate metabolism (26.11%), defense and stress response
(23.45%), and amino acid metabolism (19.91%).

The other categories
are: genetic information processing/transcription; translation (6.64%);
cell growth and death/endocytosis/apoptosis/senescence (5.31%); signaling
pathway (4.87%); folding, sorting, and degradation (3.09%); biosynthesis
of other secondary metabolites (3.09%); lipid metabolism (2.66%);
metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (2.21%); nucleotide metabolism
(1.32%); cellular community/cell motility (0.88%); and metabolism
of xenobiotics (0.44%) (Figure 8A).

Figure 8 Functional categorization based on KEGG database of (A) upregulated
and (B) downregulated proteins.

The effect of B. contaminans NZ resulted
in the upregulation of several proteins involved in energy and carbohydrate
metabolism, glycolysis, and citric acid cycle. Many proteins involved
in defense response were also upregulated, such as the molecular chaperones,
antioxidant enzymes, and heat shock proteins, indicating their crucial
protective roles against biotic stress.

Downregulated DEPs:
The three major categories of downregulated DEPs are defense- and
stress-related (22.5%), energy and carbohydrate metabolism (16.9%),
and cell growth and death/apoptosis/senescence (15.5%).

The
other categories are: amino acid metabolism (9.9%), xenobiotic biodegradation
and metabolism (8.4%), translation and transcription (5.6%), lipid
metabolism (4.2%), biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (4.2%),
transport and cellular motility (4.2%), signal transduction (2.8%),
metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (2.8%), and folding, sorting,
and degradation (2.8%) (Figure 8B).

The downregulated proteins of energy and carbohydrate
metabolism are mainly related to biosynthesis of disaccharides, polysaccharides,
metabolism of amino sugars, fatty acid biosynthesis, and the oxidative
pentose phosphate pathway.

As the enzymes essential for cell
wall rigidity, cell integrity and important regulators of growth,
cell division, motility, and oxidative damage protecting antioxidant
systems enzymes were downregulated majorly, it is clear that B. contaminans NZ manifests profound stress on the
fungal cell wall structure and organization.

Strikingly, pathogenicity
regulatory genes and metabolic and signaling responsive proteins were
also downregulated, indicating that M. phaseolina resorts to energy conservation as an effective strategy for countering
the stress imposed by B. contaminans NZ.

Protein–protein interaction networks are important
for understanding cellular processes at the systems level.22 To assess such interactive network of up- and
downregulated fungal proteins, the most upregulated protein enolase
was searched as the query protein in the STRING database. The predicted
functional partners were found to be pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate
kinase, and triosephosphate isomerase. In M. phaseolina, all of these proteins were found to be upregulated with enolase
(Figure 9A).

analysis of (A) enolase and (B) GRX1 (glutathione S-transferase) using
STRING database.

As an example of a downregulated
protein, glutathione S-transferase, which plays an important role
in oxidative stress management, was used as another input in the STRING
database. Its predicted functional partners were found to be glutaredoxin
and glutathione oxidoreductase, both of which were found to be downregulated
along with the input protein (Figure 9B).

Discussion
Many researchers have
focused their attention on bio-control approaches for limiting the
growth of Macrophomina phaseolina.
In this regard, Burkholderia sp. has been known for
some time to be effective in controlling the growth of this plant
pathogen.23 While studying a microbiome
of jute, Burkholderia contaminans NZ
isolated as a jute endophyte was also found to be a potent bio-control
agent effective against M. phaseolina. Since proteomics is now widely employed to recognize factors responsive
to environmental or biotic stresses, a comparison of both B. contaminans NZ challenged and unchallenged proteome
of M. phaseolina was expected to provide
an understanding of physiological responses to this biotic stress
condition and highlight the variations in the protein profile following
the stress.

Besides the genome sequence of M.
phaseolina that depicts its large arsenal of hydrolyzing
enzymes,17 not much is known about the
protein profile of the fungus. Abundance of the hydrolyzing enzymes
was validated by our proteome data (Figure 4C). Upon further analyses of the differentially
regulated proteins, a pattern became apparent, which allowed an understanding
of how this pathogen while losing its killing prowess manages to survive
under “hibernating” conditions when confronted by B. contaminans NZ.

Based on the data collected
through this experiment, M. phaseolina appears to be significantly affected by the presence of B. contaminans NZ. Its proteome changes considerably
with elevated expression of defense responsive genes, and it seems
to apply a major emphasis on energy production through the recruitment
of diverse pathways and by decreasing the anabolic system (lipid synthesis,
etc). Most of the highly abundant proteins obtained under B. contaminans NZ-induced stress are found to be
involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. The main pathways
affected are the classical glycolytic pathway, TCA cycle, oxidative
phosphorylation, pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis. Further
carbohydrate metabolic processes which were also affected include
fructose, sucrose, starch, and other monosaccharide metabolic pathways.

Proteins
Upregulated
Proteins Involved in Carbohydrate and Energy
Metabolism
Enolase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis, is
known to respond to stress by increasing its expression.24 This enzyme has been reported to be a multifunctional
protein, upregulated in heat shock and in response to hypoxic stress
and glucose deprivation.24

Thus,
a 6.2-fold upregulation of enolase implies that B.
contaminans NZ causes substantial stress on M. phaseolina, which alludes to an all-out effort
by the latter to stay alive. It corroborates why viable fungus is
obtained even from 3-month-old bacteria–fungus co-culture plates.
Studies by De Backer et al. and Lo et al. showed that knockout of
enolase (ENO1) gene causes a reduction in the growth rate and mycelium
formation and increased drug sensitivity in C. albicans.(24)

Another upregulated enzyme, triosephosphate
isomerase, crucial for glycolysis, has also been reported to be regulated
in various abiotic stress responses, and the expression is highly
increased under oxidative stress.25 Additionally,
elevated expression of the glycolytic enzyme 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent
phosphoglycerate mutase observed for M. phaseolina was similar to that found for Pallisentis umbellatus, where both the enzymes and the glycolytic pathways were found to
be induced under oxidative stressed condition during the initial sclerotia
formation.26

Phosphoglycerate kinase,
a housekeeping enzyme of the glycolytic pathway reported to protect
cells against oxidants,27 was also in the
list of proteins which showed an elevated expression. A proteome analysis
of A. fumigatus, where 117 proteins
were identified with an altered abundance in response to hypoxia,
phosphoglycerate kinase was also shown to have increased activity.27

Other key glycolytic enzymes, namely,
ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase along with other glycolytic enzymes
ketose-bisphosphate aldolase class-2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
and pyruvate kinase, had elevated levels in M. phaseolina after B. contaminans NZ challenge.

Upregulation of the citric acid and oxidative phosphorylation pathways
indicate a possible mechanism by which M. phaseolina tries to overcome B. contaminans NZ
challenge. One of the most significantly upregulated proteins, citrate
synthase, determines the fungal ability to survive by reducing its
competition for nutrient resources.28 Upregulation
of formate dehydrogenase, which has an important role in respiration
and oxidative phosphorylation and is known to provide alternative
metabolic pathways, is thought to help fungal survival under unfavorable
conditions.29

Proteins Necessary for
Defense
M. phaseolina also
upregulates some of its defense-related proteins upon bacterial stress,
including chaperonins and heat shock proteins, which usually function
as signals to biotic stressors. Among them, Hsp 12 is solely responsible
for stress tolerance, cell morphology, and adhesion, and Hsp 20 and
70 are involved in membrane and cellular protein maintenance.30 Upregulation of such proteins appears to limit
the growth of M. phaseolina in the
presence of B. contaminans NZ (as evident
from the microscopic study of fungal filaments (Figure 2)).

Proteins Downregulated
Proteins
Involved in Oxidative Stress Management
M.
phaseolina fails to confront the oxidative stressed
condition posed by B. contaminans NZ
because of downregulation of its major oxidative stress controlling
systems and the machinery that helps to maintain integrity and rigidity
of its cell wall. In fungal intracellular signaling, ROS is used to
decide between growth and proliferation on the one hand and growth
arrest and cell differentiation on the other.31 Interestingly, most of the rate-limiting enzymes related to oxidative
stress response pathway were shown to be downregulated in M. phaseolina under B. contaminans NZ stress. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway
(glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) responsible for NADPH production
was found to be downregulated. Since a steady supply of glutathione
was apparently absent due to the downregulation of glucose-6-phosphate
1-dehydrogenase, glutathione-associated enzymes like glutathione S-transferase
and glutaredoxin were also found to be downregulated.

Reduced
expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress management appears
to be a target for B. contaminans NZ
inhibition, and as a result, an array of proteins like the peroxidase,
flavodoxin, glutaredoxin, etc. involved in such stress response was
found to be downregulated.32

Proteins
for Cellular and Structural Integrity
Proteins essential
for cell wall rigidity and cell integrity, namely, tubulin, were greatly
downregulated, indicating an influence on fungal cell wall structure
or organization. Glycosyl transferase family 39, essential for cell
wall rigidity, cell integrity and budding, growth, and adaptation
to environmental stress, was also downregulated.33 Glutamine amidotransferase class-2, a downregulated enzyme,
is reported to be induced by cell wall stressors.34 It catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic
pathway for the synthesis of a cell wall protein, chitin. Expression
of cell wall modification genes is expected to be altered when fungi
are exposed to stress conditions.7 Another
downregulated protein, heterokaryon incompatibility Het-C reported
for regulation of cell wall assembly is essential in fungal growth
and development.35

Downregulation
of the main regulators of growth, cell division, motility, and development,
such as RasGTPase, microtubule proteins, tubulin α chain, kinesin-like
protein, etc., could also be responsible for the observed reduction
in growth and marked morphological change in hyphae with swollen and
balloon-shaped cells and subcellular abnormalities.36 Excessive hyphal branching close to the bacterial colony
was discernible (Figure 2). Such morphological changes in the cell membrane have also been
reported forF. solani and C. dematium following inhibition
by Burkholderia cepacia.(37)

Proteins Involved in Producing Secondary
Metabolites
Fungi, especially the filamentous ones, produce
a range of secondary metabolites associated with pathogenicity through
the involvement of various cytochrome P450s (CYPs).38 In F. asiaticum, it has
been reported that tubulin binding cofactor A (TBCA) plays a vital
role in the vegetative growth, conidiation, temperature sensitivity,
and virulence.39 Downregulation of both
cytochrome P450s and TBCA explain the reasons behind the observed
loss of pathogenicity in the case of Burkholderia challenged M. phaseolina.

The
secondary metabolite melanin is important for fungal survival and
plays a crucial role in infecting hosts.40 As melanin synthesis is essential for fungal pathogenicity, enzymes
involved in melanin biosynthesis like scytalone dehydratase have been
considered a good target for developing control agents against fungal
diseases.41 After bacterial interaction,
scytalone dehydratase of M. phaseolina was found to be downregulated 7.69-fold, indicating severe impairment
of melanin biosynthesis, leading to decreased stress tolerance and
virulence.42

Proteins Involved in Virulence
Moreover, GTP-binding proteins like septins (downregulated in M. phaseolina after the biotic stress) are generally
necessary for virulence in fungal pathogens and are directly associated
in host tissue adhesion and entry.43 In C. albicans, a family of four flavodoxin-like proteins
(FLPs) act as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductases, conferring important
antioxidant effects. FLPs reduce ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), which in
turn serve as a free-radical-scavenging antioxidant in the membrane
and is critical for fungal virulence.32 With the downregulation of flavodoxin in M. phaseolina, B. contaminans NZ appears to exude
both oxidative stress and reduced fungal pathogenicity.

In a
virulence study of A. fumigatus, ribosomal
biogenesis proteins, RNA-processing protein HAT helix, and signaling
molecules (including G-protein, Ras protein RasGTPase, and recoverin)
have been reported to increase virulence through an alteration of
the metabolic response under stressed conditions.44 These same proteins found to be downregulated in M. phaseolina emphasize their effect on fungal virulence.
The downregulated NmrA like protein is known to serve as a regulator
of the sugar-sensor mechanism integrating carbon and nitrogen metabolism
to control plant infection in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.(45)

Conclusions
This pioneering proteomics study has shed
light on how M. phaseolina, a versatile
organism in terms of sustainability, employs diverse combating mechanisms
resulting in a tug of war that leads to an apparent inhibition of
fungal growth. However, the phytopathogen under siege manages to stay
dormant in its own territory and reverts from its arrested growth
to an active life with reduced virulence once the challenge is removed.
The available genome data and now this proteomic analysis have contributed
to a novel understanding of how this devastating fungal pathogen responds
towards bio-control and stress.
