To
explore the structural transformation of cyclopentadienyl ruthenium (CpRu) complexes in response to
external stimuli, the reaction of [RuCp(MeCN)3][X] (X =
PF6, (FSO2)2N [= FSA]) and tris(alkylthio)benzenes
(1,3,5-C6H3(SR)3; L1: R = Pr, L2: R = Me) was investigated, and the crystal structures and thermal
properties of the products were examined. The reaction produced the
sandwich complexes [RuCpLn][X]
or dinuclear complexes [Ru2Cp2(μ-Ln)2(CH3CN)m][X]2 (X = PF6, FSA)
depending on the reaction conditions. The sandwich complex [RuCpL1][FSA] was an ionic liquid. The
solids of dinuclear complexes transformed into the thermodynamically
stable sandwich complexes upon heating accompanied by acetonitrile
loss. This change resulted in a transformation from crystal to ionic
liquid for complexes with the FSA anion. UV irradiation of the sandwich
complex [RuCpL1][PF6] in methanol produced the dinuclear complex [Ru2Cp2(μ-L1)2L12][PF6]2. The complex transformed into the sandwich complex
upon heating.

Introduction
Many cyclopentadienyl
ruthenium (CpRu) complexes have been synthesized
to date because of the interest in their chemical reactivities and
catalytic activities.1−15 They are also used for the construction of various supramolecular
assemblies.16−18 A versatile precursor for their production is the
triacetonitrile complex [RuCp(MeCN)3]+,9−13 which produces cationic sandwich-type Ru complexes upon reaction
with arene ligands.13−15

Ionic liquids are salts with melting points
below 100 °C,23,24 and we have synthesized a variety
of organometallic ionic liquids
containing cationic sandwich complexes.19−22 In particular, ionic liquids
with the formula [RuCp(arene)][X] (X = fluorinated anion) have been
prepared using the reaction of [RuCp(MeCN)3]+ with arene ligands.25−28 As part of this investigation, we previously found that the reaction
with ortho-substituted benzenes afforded either sandwich-type or chelate
complexes depending on the reaction conditions (Figure 1), and their interconversion in solution
was possible upon application of light and heat.29 Based on this mechanism, organometallic ionic liquids that
transform into amorphous coordination polymers upon photo-irradiation
were designed.30,31

Figure 1 Reaction of [RuCp(MeCN)3]+ with 1,2-disubstituted
benzene ligands (L). Transformation between the products
occurs in acetonitrile by application of light and heat (E, E′
= SMe, NMe2).

In this study, to further
explore the structural transformations
of CpRu complexes via external stimuli, the reaction of the triacetonitrile
complex with meta-substituted ligands was performed because they cannot
form chelate complexes unlike the ortho-substituted benzenes. The
reaction with 1,3,5-C6H3(SR)3 ligands
(L1: R = Pr; L2: R = Me) produced sandwich-type or dinuclear
complexes depending on the reaction condition (Figure 2). The hexafluorophosphate (PF6–) and bis(fluorosulfonyl) amide ((FSO2)2N–; FSA) anions were used as counter
anions. The FSA anion is often used for the preparation of ionic liquids.24 The thermal properties of the products were
investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), along
with crystal structure determination. Furthermore, the thermal reactivity
of the dinuclear complexes and the photochemical reactivity of the
sandwich-type complexes were investigated.

benzenes investigated in this study. The thermal reaction and photochemical
reactions of the products are also shown.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation and Thermal Properties of the
Sandwich-Type Complexes
A solution of [RuCp(MeCN)3][PF6] and L1 or L2 in 1,2-dichloroethane was heated
at 90 °C for 16 h to
produce the sandwich-type complexes [1a][PF6] and [1b][PF6] in 83 and 76% yields, respectively
(Figure 2, top), as
pale yellow crystals. In addition, [1a][FSA] was synthesized
using the same procedure from [RuCp(MeCN)3][FSA] in 75%
yield. The complex was obtained as a pale yellow liquid, which solidified
upon application of physical agitation at low temperature (−16
°C).

The thermal properties of the prepared complexes were
investigated via DSC, and the obtained data are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. The melting points of [1a][PF6] and [1b][PF6]
were 99.5 and 213.7 °C, respectively, and they crystallized upon
cooling from the melt (Figure 3a). The melting point of [1a][FSA] was 42.7 °C,
and this salt can be regarded as an ionic liquid. Once melted, this
salt maintained the liquid state at room temperature, exhibiting a
glass transition at −52 °C upon further cooling (Figure 3b). The ratio of
the glass transition temperature to the melting point (Tg/Tm) was 0.68, in agreement
with the empirical relationship (Tg/Tm ≈ 2/3).32 This complex exhibited a phase transition at −53.5 °C
(ΔH = 1.3 kJ mol–1) in the
solid state.

states,

Crystal
Structures of the Sandwich-Type Complexes
The
crystal structures of [1a][PF6] and [1b][PF6] were determined at 90 K, crystallizing
in space groups P21212 and P21/c, respectively. The packing
diagrams are provided in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), and the structures of the cations are shown in Figure 4. One of the four
crystallographically independent cations is shown for [1a][PF6], while the other cations are provided in Figure
S2 (Supporting Information) and exhibit
different substituent conformations. The Ru–Cpcentroid and Ru–Arenecentroid distances in these cations
are 1.82 and 1.71 Å, respectively, which are usual values for
CpRu complexes.28,31 The C–S–C angles
of [1a][PF6] and [1b][PF6] were 101.5–105.1° and 102.8–103.3°,
respectively. In both crystals, the cations exhibited intermolecular
π–π interactions between the arene rings, forming
a dimeric structure with centroid–centroid distances of 3.43
([1a][PF6]) and 3.37 Å ([1b][PF6]), respectively.

(a) [1a][PF6] and (b) [1b][PF6]. The hydrogen
atoms were omitted for clarity.

Preparation and Thermal Properties of the Dinuclear Complexes
The reaction of [RuCp(MeCN)3][PF6] and the
ligands in acetone at room temperature produced orange crystals of
the acetonitrile-coordinated dinuclear complexes [2a][PF6]2 and [2b][PF6]2 in 28 and 37% yields, respectively (Figure 2, bottom). Similarly, the reaction of [RuCp(MeCN)3][FSA] and L1 under the
same conditions produced orange crystals of [2a′][FSA]2 in 22% yield.

Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
showed that the acetonitrile ligands in the complexes are released
upon heating. The TG curves of [2a][PF6]2 and [2b][PF6]2 measured
at 10 °C min–1 are shown in Figure 5. Weight losses of approximately
6 wt% at 140–160 °C (Figure 5a) and 10 wt% at 158–180 °C (Figure 5b) corresponded to
the loss of acetonitrile (calculated values: 6.3 and 7.2 wt%, respectively).
At higher temperatures (approximately 200–350 °C), both
complexes showed a gradual weight loss of approximately 60 wt %, corresponding
to the arene ligand loss (calculated values: 50.9 and 61.5 wt%, respectively).

Figure 5 TG–DTA
traces of (a) [2a][PF6]2 and (b)
[2b][PF6]2 at
10 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
TG and DTA curves are shown in solid and dashed lines, respectively.

[2a][PF6]2 exhibited
melting
and acetonitrile loss simultaneously, which was observed as an endothermic
peak at approximately 152 °C (onset: 141 °C) in the differential
thermal analysis (DTA) curve (Figure 5a), whereas [2b][PF6] melted
at a higher temperature than the acetonitrile loss, exhibiting two
peaks at approximately 168 and 202 °C (onset) in the DTA curve
(Figure 5b). Their
thermal properties were also investigated using DSC (see below), which
revealed that the loss of acetonitrile was accompanied by a structural
transformation to the sandwich complexes.

Crystal Structures of the
Dinuclear Complexes
The crystal
structures of [2a][PF6] and [2b][PF6] were determined at 90 K, and the dinuclear cationic
complex structures are shown in Figure 6. The two Ru ions in each cation are bridged by two
arene ligands, where each Ru ion is coordinated with an acetonitrile
and the two sulfur atoms of the arene ligands. Therefore, one of the
three sulfur atoms in each arene ligand remained uncoordinated. In
[2a][PF6]2, three of the six propyl
substituents exhibited twofold disorder with occupancies of 0.57:0.43–0.76:0.24.
One Cp ring exhibited rotational disorder over two sites with an occupancy
of 0.58:0.42. The coordination bond lengths in [2a][PF6]2 (Ru–S = 2.35–2.39 Å, Ru–N
= 2.06 Å) and [2b][PF6]2 (Ru–S
= 2.37 Å, Ru–N = 2.06 Å) were almost identical. However,
the coordination angles of S–Ru–N (84.1–93.4°
in [2a][PF6]2; 92.9° in [2b][PF6]2) and S–Ru–S
(93.4 and 94.9° in [2a][PF6]2; 98.7° in [2b][PF6]2) differed
slightly probably because of the packing effect. The two arene rings
in the cation of [2a][PF6] exhibited a 11.6°
dihedral angle, whereas those in [2b][PF6]2 were oriented in a parallel manner because the cation is
located on the inversion center. The centroid–centroid distances
between the two arene rings in these complexes were 3.65 and 3.53
Å, respectively, and were likely stabilized by intramolecular
π–π interactions. The dinuclear structure resembles
the structural motif of the previously reported AgI coordination
polymer [Ag2(bsb)2(ClO4)2]n [bsb = 1,3,5-tris(benzylsulfanyl)benzene].33

Figure 6 Molecular structures of the cations in (a) [2a][PF6]2 and (b) [2b][PF6]2.

The crystal structure of [2a′][FSA]2 could not be determined, but
it likely has a similar dinuclear structure.
This complex contains only one acetonitrile ligand in the cation,
in contrast to [2a][PF6] and [2b][PF6]; hence, a sulfide moiety of an adjacent unit in
the crystal probably coordinates to the metal center instead of acetonitrile.
This structure seems plausible considering the structure of [3a][PF6]2 (see below).

Thermal Conversion
from a Dinuclear to Sandwich-Type Complex
The formation of
the sandwich-type and dinuclear complexes by the
reactions at 90 °C and room temperature, respectively, indicates
that they are the thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively.
DFT calculations also indicated that the sandwich-type complex is
thermodynamically more stable (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Based on this feature, we could observe a thermal
transformation from the dinuclear complex to the sandwich-type complex.

The photographs taken upon heating the crystals of [2a][PF6]2 are shown in Figure 7a. Upon heating, the orange crystals melted
at approximately 150 °C, affording an orange liquid [Figure 7a(ii)]. The liquid
turned to a pale yellow liquid of [1a][PF6] upon further heating [154–159 °C; Figure 7a(iii–iv)], and this
color change is consistent with the coordination transformation to
the sandwich complex accompanied by acetonitrile loss. Complete transformation
to [1a][PF6] was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The DSC trace of this complex measured in a sealed
pan is shown in Figure 8a. A large endothermic peak was observed at 153.5 °C (ΔH = 128 kJ mol–1), which corresponds to
melting and concomitant structural transformation. Upon cooling, the
resultant mixture of [1a][PF6] and acetonitrile
did not solidify and exhibited a glass transition at −66 °C,
whereas removal of acetonitrile by vacuum drying left a solid of [1a][PF6].

Figure 7 Photographs of (a) [2a][PF6]2, (b) [2a′][FSA]2, and (c) [2b][PF6]2 (polycrystals
and single crystals)
taken upon heating.

Figure 8 DSC traces of (a) [2a][PF6]2 and (b) [2b][PF6]2 measured in
a sealed pan where liq. and gl. are the liquid and glassy states,
respectively. The discontinuity observed at 180 °C on the cooling
runs is an artifact.

The photographs of [2a′][FSA]2 taken
upon heating are shown in Figure 7b. The orange crystals melted at around 145 °C
and concomitantly transformed to the sandwich complex [1a][FSA] [Figure 7b(ii)],
which was a pale brown liquid. Therefore, the conversion from the
solid to ionic liquid was achieved.

In contrast, the crystals
of [2b][PF6]2 did not melt because
the cation contained no alkyl chains.
The photographs of this complex are shown in Figure 7c. The orange crystals exhibited the acetonitrile
loss and coordination transformation at approximately 160 °C
in the solid state, affording [1b][PF6] as
a white solid [Figure 7c, top row, (i)]. The solid melted upon further heating to approximately
210 °C. On the other hand, upon heating single crystals, melting
was observed at around 165 °C [Figure 7c, bottom row, (i)]. This was due to the
presence of acetonitrile in the product. Consistently, when DSC measurements
of [2b][PF6]2 was performed in
a sealed pan (Figure 8b), melting occurred at 166.4 °C with structural transformation,
yielding a large enthalpy change (ΔH = 93.7
kJ mol–1). In the second cycle, melting was observed
at around 200 °C because most of the acetonitrile has escaped
during subsequent heating.

Photochemical Reaction of the Sandwich-type
Complex
The sandwich complex [1a][PF6] underwent
a photochemical reaction in solution (365 nm), yielding a dinuclear
complex (Figure 2,
upper right). [1b][PF6] was insoluble in methanol
and unsuitable for photoreaction investigation.

UV irradiation
of [1a][PF6] in methanol for 3 h produced
orange crystals of [Ru2Cp2(μ-L1)2L12][PF6]2 ([3a][PF6]2) in 28% yield. The structure of the
cation was determined by X-ray crystallography at 90 K and is shown
in Figure 9 (space
group P-1). The cation exhibited a dinuclear structure
similar to that of [2a][PF6]2,
but with four arene ligands, two of which were coordinated to the
Ru ions instead of acetonitrile. The cation adopted a centrosymmetric
structure, and the two arene rings bridging the Ru ions were arranged
in parallel. The centroid–centroid and interplane distances
between the two were 3.80 and 3.21 Å, respectively. The average
Ru–S bond lengths and S–Ru–S angles were 2.38
Å and 84.6–93.3°, respectively. Four of the six crystallographically
independent propylthio substituents exhibited twofold disorder, with
occupancy ratios of 0.50:0.50–0.81:0.19.

Figure 9 Molecular structure of
the cation in [3a][PF6]2.

Heating the [3a][PF6]2 solid
at 170 °C for 5 min quantitatively afforded a mixture of [1a][PF6] and L1. Therefore, this dinuclear complex was thermally transformed to
a sandwich complex, similar to the other dinuclear complexes.

Conclusions
The reaction of the triacetonitrile CpRu complex [RuCp(MeCN)3]+ with 1,3,5-tris(alkylthio)benzenes produced
either sandwich-type complexes or dinuclear complexes depending on
reaction conditions. Dinuclear complex formation from the meta-substituted
ligands is a striking contrast to the formation of mononuclear chelate
complexes from the ortho-substituted ligands. The dinuclear complexes
exhibited a novel structural type and are interesting from a supramolecular
perspective. Furthermore, the dinuclear complexes transformed to thermodynamically
stable sandwich complexes upon heating concomitant with the loss of
acetonitrile. The sandwich complex photochemically produced a dinuclear
complex with four ligands in solution.

We explored the phase
change phenomenon coupled with structural
changes of metal complexes upon application of external stimuli based
on the unique reactivities of CpRu complexes. The transformation between
the ionic liquid and amorphous solid upon application of light and
heat was previously reported. In this study, a thermal conversion
from the crystal to ionic liquid was achieved, adding versatility
to the material transformation phenomenon of CpRu complexes.

Synthesis of the Ligands
1,3,5-Tris(propylthio)benzene
(L1)
K2CO3 (79 mg, 0.57 mmol) and
1-bromopropane (71 mg, 0.57 mmol) were added to a DMSO (1.5 mL) solution
of 1,3,5-benzenetrithiol (20 mg, 0.12 mmol) and stirred at room temperature
for 10 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was subsequently
heated to 50 °C and stirred for 1 d. Water (7.5 mL) was added
to the mixture, and the solution was extracted with diethyl ether.
The organic layer was washed with water and a saturated saline solution.
The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent
was then evaporated under reduced pressure. The resultant pale yellow
liquid was dried under vacuum for 5 h at room temperature (28 mg,
81%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.03

This ligand was
prepared by a modification of the
published procedure.35 1,3,5-Trifluorobenzene
(40 mg, 0.3 mmol) was added dropwise to a NaSCH3 (135 mg,
1.9 mmol) suspension in dehydrated 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone
(4 mL) with stirring for 16 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the
reaction mixture was added to water and a white precipitate was collected
by filtration, washed successively with water and cold methanol, and
vacuum-dried (55 mg, 86%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 2.47 (s, 9H, CH3), 6.88 (s,
3H, C6H3).

Synthesis of
the Sandwich-Type Complexes
[RuCpL1][PF6] ([1a][PF6])
L1 (77 mg, 0.26 mmol) was added to
a dehydrated
1,2-dichloroethane solution (2 mL) of [RuCp(MeCN)3][PF6] (56 mg, 0.11 mmol), and the resulting solution was refluxed
for 20 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting solution was evaporated
under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in a small amount
of dichloromethane before being subjected to column chromatography
(alumina, eluent: diethyl ether and then acetonitrile). The fraction
containing the desired salt was collected and evaporated. The residue
was dissolved in a small amount of acetone, to which excess of diethyl
ether was added to precipitate the product as a white powder (65 mg,
83%). Pale yellow crystals were obtained upon recrystallization from
acetone–diethyl ether at −40 °C (36 mg, 46%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): δ 1.07 (t, 9H, CH3, J = 7.4 Hz), 1.73 (sext,

[1b][PF6] was
synthesized using the same procedure as [1a][PF6] using [RuCp(MeCN)3][PF6]
(51.2 mg, 0.12 mmol) and L2 (50.0
mg, 0.23 mmol). Recrystallization of the product (55 mg, 76%) from
acetone–diethyl ether at −40 °C afforded pale yellow
crystals (15 mg, 27%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN):

[RuCpL1][FSA] ([1a][FSA])
An aqueous solution (0.5 mL) of K[FSA] (53 mg, 0.245
mmol) was added to an acetone (2.5 mL) solution of [RuCpL1][PF6] (38 mg, 0.062 mmol) and
stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The solution was extracted with
dichloromethane (20 mL), and the organic layer was dried over MgSO4 before being evaporated. The procedure was repeated seven
times until the complete disappearance of PF6– was confirmed by 19F NMR spectra (CD3CN).
The resulting yellow oil was purified via column chromatography (activated
alumina, dichloromethane (Rf = 0.1)/acetonitrile (Rf = 0.9), gradient from 1:0 to 0:1). The solution was evaporated
and dried in vacuo for 6 h to afford a yellow liquid (32 mg, 28%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): δ 1.06 (t, 9H, CH3, J = 7.4 Hz), 1.72 (sext,
6H, CH2), 3.02 (t, 6H, CH2, J = 7.4 Hz), 5.29 (s, 5H, Cp-H5), 6.32 (s, 3H, C6H3). Anal. Calcd for C20H29F2O4S5NRu: C, 37.14; H, 4.52; N, 2.17.

was also synthesized using the same procedure as [1a][PF6], with [RuCp(MeCN)3][FSA] (82 mg, 0.18 mmol) and L1 (111 mg, 0.37 mmol) in 75% yield
(84.9 mg).

Synthesis of the Dinuclear Complexes
[Ru2Cp2(μ-L1)2(MeCN)2][PF6]2 ([2a][PF6]2)
[RuCp(MeCN)3][PF6] (18.5 mg, 0.042 mmol) and L1 (25.1 mg, 0.083 mmol) were dissolved
in acetone (0.5 mL) in a test tube. Diethyl ether (10 mL) was then
carefully layered onto the solution. Orange crystals of [2a][PF6]2 were formed by storing the solution
in the dark at room temperature for 2 days (16.1 mg, 29%). The product
dissociated in CD3CN to yield a mixture of [RuCp(MeCN)(CD3CN)2]+ and L1 in a 1:1 ratio, as confirmed by the 1H
NMR spectrum. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): δ
1.03 (t, 9H, CH3, J =
7.4 Hz), 1.66 (sext, 6H, CH2), 1.99 (s,

[2a′][FSA]2 was synthesized using the same
procedure as [2a][PF6]2 with [RuCp(MeCN)3][FSA] (15 mg, 0.032
mmol) and L1 (19 mg, 0.064 mmol).
Acetone and diethyl ether were bubbled with nitrogen gas for 15 min
before use. The product was obtained as an orange solid (10 mg, 22%)
and dissociated in CD3CN to give a mixture of [RuCp(MeCN)(CD3CN)2]+ and L1 in a 1:1 ratio, as confirmed by the 1H
NMR spectrum. The ratio of the Cp ligand to acetonitrile in the spectrum
was 2:1. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): δ 1.03
(t, 9H, CH3, J = 7.4
Hz), 1.66 (sext, 6H, CH2), 1.99 (s, 3H),
2.96 (t, 6H, CH2, J =
7.4 Hz), 4.30 (s, 5H, Cp-H5), 7.03 (s,
3H, C6H3). Anal. Calcd for
C42H61N5Ru2S10O8F4: C, 37.79; H, 4.61; N, 3.15. Found: C,

Photochemical
Reaction of [1a][PF6]
A solution
of [1a][PF6] (10.1 mg, 0.019
mmol) in MeOH (0.6 mL) was irradiated with UV light (365 nm LED light,
100 mW cm–2) for 3 h, gradually forming orange needle
crystals of [Ru2Cp2(μ-L1)2L12][PF6]2 ([3a][PF6]2). The crystals were washed with cold
methanol and dried under air (5.1 mg, 28%). Anal. Calcd for C70H106F12P2Ru2S12: C, 46.08; H, 5.86; N, 0.00. Found: C, 45.87; H, 5.94; N,
0.11. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): δ 1.03
(t, 9H, CH3, J = 7.4
Hz), 1.66 (sext, 6H, CH2), 2.96 (t, 6H,
CH2, J = 7.4 Hz), 4.30
(s, 5H, Cp-H5), 7.03 (s, 3H, C6H3). FT-IR (ATR, cm–1): 535, 543, 580, 676 (Ar), 1129, 1239, 1380, 1456, 1554, 2873, 2931,
2962. Heating [3a][PF6]2 at 170
°C for 5 min produced a liquid mixture of [1a][PF6] and L1 as confirmed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
