Polyethylene
mimics of semicrystalline polyphosphoesters (PPEs)
with an adjustable amount of noncovalent cross-links were synthesized.
Acyclic diene metathesis copolymerization of a phosphoric acid triester
(M1) with a novel phosphoric acid diester monomer (M2) was achieved. PPEs with different co-monomer ratios and
0, 20, 40, and 100% of phosphodiester content were synthesized. The
phosphodiester groups result in supramolecular interactions between
the polymer chains, with the P–OH functionality as an H-bond
donor and the P=O group as an H-bond acceptor. A library of
unsaturated and saturated PPEs was prepared and analyzed in detail
by NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, differential scanning
calorimetry, thermogravimetry, rheology, and stress–strain
measurements. The introduction of the supramolecular cross-links into
the aliphatic and hydrophobic PPEs showed a significant impact on
the material properties: increased glass-transition and melting temperatures
were observed and an increase in the storage modulus of the polymers
was achieved. This specific combination of a flexible aliphatic backbone
and a supramolecular H-bonding interaction between the chains was
maximized in the homopolymer of the phosphodiester monomer, which
featured additional properties, such as shape-memory properties, and
polymer samples could be healed after cutting. The P–OH groups
also showed a strong adhesion toward metal surfaces, which was used
together with the shape-memory function in a model device that responds
to a temperature stimulus with shape change. This systematic variation
of phosphodiesters/phosphotriesters in polyethylene mimics further
underlines the versatility of the phosphorus chemistry to build up
complex macromolecular architectures.

==== Body
Introduction
Inspired by nature,
supramolecular chemistry uses hydrogen bonding,1−4 metal–ligand interactions,5 or
donor–acceptor π–π stacking6 to assemble small molecules or polymers into materials
with an extensive range of properties.7 In nature, complex structures are generated by hydrogen bonding
such as proteins, which fold into specific three-dimensional structures
to enable their function, or DNA with hydrogen bonding between the
nucleic acids, which plays a crucial role in the double-helical structure.8 The strength of a single hydrogen bond (H-bond)
is ca. 10–40 kJ mol–1 relatively weak; however,
multiple H-bonds result in high cohesive energies, which can act as
physical cross-links in polymer networks. Due to the temperature sensitivity
of H-bonded networks, their viscoelasticity can be changed to give
low-viscosity melts or more solidlike properties. However, by choice
of the H-bonds, the material properties can be designed in advance
due to weak H-bonds having a fast bond exchange, which results in
stimuli responsiveness, whereas strong H-bonds having a retarded bond
exchange leading to solidlike properties. Several technological concepts
such as self-healing,9 shape-memory processes,10 and dynamic energy dissipation11 have been achieved by the incorporation of H-bonds into
polymers. H-bonds alter or improve the mechanical properties of a
polymer12,13 and are not only crucial for industrially
important polymers like polyurethanes or polyamides13−15 but have also
been reported in several supramolecular polymers.16,17

We have been recently working on aliphatic polyethylene (PE)
mimics
based on P-containing aliphatic polymers. Such polyphosphoesters (PPEs)
or polypyrophosphates crystallized similar to polyethylene but bring
the potential to be degradable.18−20 In linear main-chain PPEs, two
phosphoesters build the polymer backbone, whereas the pendant ester
group can be used to tune their chemical functionality.21,22 Besides chemical functionality, herein we used the pendant chain
to introduce physical cross-linking into a polyphosphoester PE mimic.
Phosphodiester groups were installed into the polymer backbone, with
the P–OH functionality as an H-bond donor and the P=O
group as an H-bond acceptor. We report the synthesis of aliphatic
PPEs with a variable amount of phosphodiesters and -triesters via
acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of A2-type
phosphodiester or -triester monomers. By the co-monomer ratio, the
amount of H-bonding groups in the main chain was adjusted to control
the properties of the noncovalent polymer network. As ADMET polymerization
produces unsaturated PPEs, with typically a low degree of crystallinity,
hydrogenation can be performed to increase their crystallinity.23 In combination with the supramolecular H-bond
interactions, this is another way to control the mechanical properties
of the polymer networks that were studied herein by rheology. Depending
on the amount of H-bonding cross-links, brittle or ductile materials
with healing and shape-memory properties were obtained. This study
expands the previous studies on aliphatic PE mimics to dynamic materials
with noncovalent cross-linking, which broaden potential applications.

Results
and Discussion
Monomer and Polymer Syntheses
To
study the influence
of noncovalent/supramolecular cross-linking, two different phosphate
monomers were prepared. Both monomers were equipped with two C11 unsaturated alkyl chains for the linear ADMET polycondensation. M1 is a phosphotriester carrying a phenoxy side group, whereas M2 is a phosphodiester with the P–OH side group, which
is able to undergo H-bonding. M1 was used by our group
previously and was synthesized by esterification of phenyl dichlorophosphate
with 10-undecen-1-ol in the presence of triethylamine.23M2 was prepared by the reaction
of phosphorus oxychloride with 2 equiv of 10-undecen-1-ol followed
by hydrolysis of the remaining P–Cl bond with water. The effect
of H-bonding on the properties of M2 can be already seen
between both monomers. At room temperature, M1 is a viscous
liquid, whereas M2 is a white solid.

The polymerization
and copolymerization of both monomers were accomplished by acyclic
diene metathesis (ADMET) (co)polymerization (Figure 1a). Polymerization was conducted in bulk
without the addition of the solvent with mechanical stirring. To adjust
the number of physical cross-links and thus to alter the mechanical
properties, copolymers with different amounts of M2 were
prepared: 0 mol % (P1), 5 mol % (P1-H0.95-co-P2-H0.05), 20 mol % (P1-H0.80-co-P2-H0.20),
40 mol % (P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40), or 100 mol % (P2). Copolymers with ≤40
mol % M2 were prepared with Grubbs first-generation catalyst.
Copolymers with higher amounts of M2 were obtained only
with Hoveyda–Grubbs first-generation catalyst. As the viscosity
increased during the polymerization, the temperature was increased
from 65 °C up to 90 °C. P(1x-co-2y) with x ≤ 40 mol % were obtained as viscous
oils at room temperature. To increase their crystallinity, hydrogenation
with 10% Pd/C was performed.

cross-linked PPEs by H-bonding between the P–OH and P=O

1H NMR and 31P NMR were used to confirm the
composition of copolymers and showed that the monomer composition
used in the synthesis is found in the polymer product. Figure 1b shows the characteristic
shift for the protons in the backbone next to the phosphates, which
allows the determination of the monomer ratio. For all polymers, gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) showed successful polymerization and
molar mass dispersities of ca. 2, as expected for a linear polycondensation,
and apparent molar masses (vs PS standards) between Mn = 4700 and 11 400 g mol–1.
For GPC measurement of P2, the P–OH groups were
converted to the methyl esters by esterification with trimethylsilyldiazomethane
to ensure solubilization in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (the 1H NMR spectra of the methoxylated P2 showed a characteristic
doublet at 3.75 ppm, proving successful esterification; cf. Figure S16). Also, the other copolymers were
transformed into the methyl ester and measured on the GPC, which increased
their apparent molar masses and probably increased their hydrodynamic
radius after esterification (cf. Table 1).

Two melting peaks were observed with P–OH functionality
above 20%, which were reported for other polymers prepared by ADMET
previously.26 The melting temperature increased
significantly with more P–OH groups incorporated into the polymers.
The crystallinity determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) shows no clear trend with increasing H-bonding, and X-ray diffractograms
(XRD) (Figure S27) revealed a similar degree
of crystallinity and crystal structure for P(1-Hx-co-2-Hy) (with y ≤ 0.4). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) indicated thermal stability between 260 and 300 °C
(Figure S26) with a relative high char
yield for P2, which could make this polymer additionally
an interesting flame retardant.27

Mechanical
Properties
Tensile Stress–Strain Measurements
From the
thermal characterization, the influence of the number of noncovalent
cross-links on the material properties was already obvious. The effect
of increasing H-bonding groups on the stress–strain behavior
of PPEs was investigated. For P1-H and P1-H0.95-co-P2-H0.05, the polymer
films were too brittle to conduct a reproducible measurement with
the dog-bone specimen. P1-H0.80-co-P2-H0.20 and P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40 polymer films and dog-bone specimen
were still relatively brittle, but already during handling, higher
flexibility was obvious. Still, relatively low elongations ranging
from 7.3 ± 0.8 to 9.5 ± 0.6% were achieved in the stress–strain
test before breaking, as expected for a brittle semicrystalline polymer
(Figure 2a). P1-H0.80-co-P2-H0.20 and P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40 showed
a relatively low material stiffness with a Young’s modulus
of 0.8 ± 0.2 GPa. In contrast, P2-H exhibited an
average elongation at break of 100 ± 30%, with a yield strength
(σy) of 20.5 MPa, as more noncovalent
interactions are present in this polymer (Figure 2b). Interestingly, the unsaturated analogue P2 showed the highest elongation at break of the investigated
samples with 640 ± 45%. The yield strength of 8.6 MPa, however,
was lower due to the decreased chain packing of the unsaturated backbone
(with cis and trans double bonds). P2-H seemed to be
stronger, probably due to the higher crystallinity and chain arrangement,
whereas P2 was less strong but more ductile and undergoes
strain crystallization after passing the yield point. This is in agreement
with the measured Young’s modulus values of 0.8 ± 0.1
GPa for P2 and 1.2 ± 0.2 GPa for P2-H, indicating a significant higher material stiffness for P2-H.

Rheological Measurements
To probe the softening and
melting behavior of the polymers, we measured the temperature dependencies
of their storage G′ and loss G″ moduli in the range of below the glass transition to a temperature
above the melting transition. The temperature sweeps in Figure 3 show that a higher P–OH
amount in the copolymers led to an increase of both glass-transition
and melting-transition temperatures. Even the unsaturated P2, with the double bonds still in the backbone, had a Tm of ca. 50 °C resulting in a solid material at room
temperature, which was not the case for the unsaturated PPEs with
a lower amount of hydrogen-bonding groups.

Figure 3 Temperature dependencies
of the storage G′
and loss G″ moduli measured on heating from
below Tg to above Tm. (a) P1-H, P1-H0.80-co-P2-H0.20 and P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40. (b) P2 and P2-H.

It is interesting to consider
and compare the moduli measured at
temperatures above the melting temperature where the crystalline parts
of the polymers are molten and the polymer chains are able to move.
For P1-H, G′ is much lower than G″ and it shows much lower viscosity compared to P1-H0.80-co-P2-H0.20 and P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40. G′ of P1-H without any H-bonding is
around 103 times lower compared to G′
of P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40, proving that P1-H has more fluidlike properties and
less elasticity. Even though G′ of P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40 is much higher
due to the H-bonding, tan δ (G″/G′) is still <1, indicating a predominantly fluidlike
material. Only when the physical cross-linking was increased to 100
mol % of monomer 2, a distinct change in the rheological
behavior was detected (Figure 3b). Unlike the polymers without H-bonding or lower H-bonding
content, G′ for P2 is larger
than G″ at temperatures above the melting
transition. Furthermore, the values of G′
of P2 were ca. 100 times higher than for P1-H0.60-co-P2-H0.40 and ca. 105 times larger than for P1-H. Over the entire
temperature range, G′ is larger than G″ showing the strong H-bonding of the phosphates
in P2, which resulted in a solidlike behavior even up
to 140 °C. After hydrogenation of P2, the melting
temperature was further increased by more than 100% to ca. 110 °C. P2-H has slightly higher G′ and G″ values compared to P2 below 30 °C
due to the more crystalline backbone; however, after melting of P2-H, both polymers show similar values for G′ and G″. The dependency of Tm, Tg, and G′ on the amount of H-bonding groups is summarized
in Figure 4. A linear
increase of thermal properties and storage modulus can be observed
for copolymers with P–OH amounts up to 80%, whereas the cumulative
H-bonding in the homopolymer P2-H led to an extraordinary
increase of Tg, Tm, and G′ values.

transition temperatures and G′ after melting

Shape-Memory and Healing Properties of P2
and P2-H
The majority of shape-memory polymers have phase-segregated
morphologies
consisting of soft and hard domains. The soft domains will crystallize
when cooled under a strained state, and under heating, those soft
domains will melt and trigger the shape-memory transition.28 Irradiation with light29,30 and heating above the polymer’s glass transition31 are other triggers for shape-memory transitions.
In P2, reversible hydrogen-bond association is combined
with crystallization of the aliphatic chains, in which the strained
state can be stabilized by forming a physical cross-linking when cooled
due to the slow H-bond exchange as well as crystallization of the
soft domains. The release of the strained state is achieved by heating
above the melting temperature of the crystalline domains and by a
fast H-bond exchange with heating.32 A
proposed mechanism for the shape memory and self-healing due to main-chain
H-bonding is shown in Figure 5. PPEs with lower amounts of M2 did not show
any shape-memory properties. Furthermore, shape-memory properties
were found only for P2 and not for P2-H.
To assess the shape-memory properties of P2, a dog-bone specimen was
prepared (Figure 5a).
After heating to 70 °C, the shape was changed by wrapping it
around an NMR tube and when allowed to cool, the shape was retained.
On heating this new shaped material again to more than 70 °C,
the original shape was almost completely recovered (Figure 5a). The difference in the melting
points of P2 and P2-H (Figure 6b) and a certain necessary
amount of H-bonding groups support our proposed mechanism in Figure 5. The strained shape
is pinned by the crystallization of our cooling PPEs and by a slower
H-bonding exchange. When heated above Tm, the crystalline parts are melting and the H-bonds can trigger the
shape memory. Due to the presence of noncovalent cross-links in the
material, P2 could also be healed by heating a cut piece above the
melting temperature of the crystalline domains (Figure 5b). For healing, specimens with different
diameters were used to allow for easily distinguished interfaces.
The cut pieces were softened at 100 °C, reattached, and then
left to heal at 100 °C for 0.5 h. The healed polymer showed the
same stretching as the original polymer cylinders (Figure 5b).

Figure 5 (a) Shape-memory properties
of P2. A dog-bone sample
was wrapped and stretched around an NMR tube at 70 °C to give
a strained spiral shape, which maintained its shape at room temperature.
The original shape was almost recovered after heating at 70 °C.
(b) Healing properties of P2. Cylindrical polymer specimens
with different diameters were used to visualize the interfaces. Healed
material was obtained after pressing multiple samples at 100 °C
together. After healing at 100 °C for 30 min, the healed material
showed similar elasticity. (c) Proposed self-healing and shape-memory
mechanism with breaking and re-association of hydrogen bonds with
temperature change.

Figure 6 (a) Tensile stress–strain
curves measured for samples of P2 before and after healing.
(b) DSC of P2 and P2-H with a heating (second
run) and cooling rate of 10 K
min–1.

The healing efficiency of P2 was further analyzed
by tensile stress–strain measurements of dog-bone specimen
of P2 (as prepared) and P2 after healing.
Elongation of ca. 640% was achieved for the “as prepared”
specimen. After cutting the dog-bone samples of P2 and
healing at 100 °C, the ultimate elongation was almost recovered
with 610 ± 20% (Figure 6a). In contrast, healing of a cut sample of P2-H was not successful probably due to the higher melting point (Figure 6b). In P2, the combination of a relatively low melting point with the multiple
H-bonds, which avoid the flow of the polymer, allows the healing to
take place efficiently above the melting. In the molten polymer, the
chains are mobile and the H-bonds exchange fast, allowing the movement
of polymer chains and the formation of new H-bonds. Once the temperature
drops, H-bonds will exchange slower and the polymer will crystallize
resulting in a completely healed material.

Combination of Metal Adhesion
and Shape Memory
The
adhesion properties of phosphoric acid esters on hydroxyapatite33,34 or metals like alumina35 are well known
and therefore these materials are often used as dental adhesives or
metal coatings. Shear lap test on alumina was conducted for the herein-prepared
polymers and underlined the strong adhesion of P2 with
a tension of 22.6 N mm–2 (Figure S28). Figure S29 shows the fractures
after the shear lap test; all polymers except P2 showed
an adhesion fracture, which is mostly an undesired fracture. P2 showed a hybrid fracture, which is desired for many applications
due to the balance of adhesion and cohesion strength. These adhesion
properties were combined with the shape-recovery process in an easy
device that responds to a temperature stimulus with a shape change: P2 was brought into a rectangular shape and used to glue two
pieces of steel together. On these metal plates, a circuit with an
light-emitting diode (LED) was installed. This closed circuit was
opened, i.e., disconnected by changing the shape of P2 after heating. In the stressed state, the metal plates are connected
(Figure 7 top) and
the LED is switched on. When the polymer glue is heated above the
melting point, the shape-memory transition was triggered and the polymer
disconnected the circuit by moving the two metal plates away from
each other (Figure 7 bottom). This combination of adhesion and shape-memory properties
might be further expanded to more sophisticated devices or smart materials
for tissue engineering (e.g., for an implant or bone adhesion).

of the shape-memory and adhesive properties of P2: P2 was glued to two metal plates after shape
deformation and a circuit was closed to light an LED. After shape
recovery, the metal plates were moved apart to disconnect the circuit.

Summary
We prepared
noncovalently cross-linked polyphosphoester PE mimics.
PPEs with a variable number of phosphodiester units were prepared
by ADMET polycondensation. Polymers with 40% or lower P–OH
functionality were brittle due to the low amount of noncovalent cross-linking.
However, they showed linear enhanced viscosity above the melting temperature
in rheology with increased H-bonding. Furthermore, PPEs with 20 and
40% H-bonding functionality were more flexible and their polymer films
could easily be processed to the dog-bone specimen, whereas PPEs with
no H-bonding or just 5% H-bonding functionality showed low flexibility.
The homopolymer of M2 carries in every mononer unit the H-bonding
functionality, which led to the highest values for tensile stress–strain
and thermal transitions. In addition, P2 exhibited healing, shape-memory
properties, and strong adhesion to metal surfaces. With the adjustable
content of noncovalent cross-linking in synthesis, the polymers exhibit
tunable mechanical properties depending on P–OH functionality
in the main chain. Combining the properties of PPEs like the degradability,
potential inherent bone adhesion, and osteoinductive potential of
phosphate-containing polymers with properties arising from the reversible
cross-linking of hydrogen bonds, these PPEs might find application
as novel materials for bone tissue regeneration. Furthermore, such
materials might also be interesting for flame-retardant coatings or
adhesives.

from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, or Fluka and used as received
unless otherwise stated. Triethylamine was distilled from calcium
hydride and stored over molecular sieves (4 Å) under argon prior
to use. Dry solvents were purchased from Acros Organics or Sigma-Aldrich
and stored with a septum and over molecular sieves. Deuterated solvents,
Grubbs first-generation catalyst, Hoveyda–Grubbs first-generation
catalyst, and Pd/C (10 wt %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and

Methods
SEC measurements were performed
in THF with
a PSS SecCurity system (Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity). Sample
injection was performed by a 1260-ALS autosampler (Waters) at 30 °C.
SDV columns (PSS) with dimensions of 300 × 80 mm2;
10 μm particle size; and pore sizes of 106, 104, and 500 Å
were employed. The DRI Shodex RI-101 detector (ERC) and UV–vis
1260-VWD detector (Agilent) were used for detection. Calibration was
achieved using polystyrene standards provided by Polymer Standards
Service. For nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra of the monomers and polymers
were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 300, 500, or 700 MHz spectrometer.
All spectra were recorded in CDCl3, CDCl3/MeOD
(7:3), or pyridine-d5 at 298 K. The spectra
were calibrated against the solvent signal and analyzed using MestReNova
8 from Mestrelab Research S.L. The thermal properties of the synthesized
polymers have been measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
on a Mettler Toledo DSC 823 calorimeter. Three scanning cycles of
heating–cooling were performed in an N2 atmosphere
with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min–1. TGA was carried out on a Mettler Toledo ThermoSTAR TGA/SDTA 851-Thermowaage
in a nitrogen atmosphere. The heating rate was 10 °C min–1 in a temperature range of 25 to 600–900 °C.
Fourier-transform infrared spectra were recorded in transmission mode
accomplished with a Bruker Tensor II (Platinum ATR). Rheology experiments
were performed using an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES,
Rheometric Scientific). Plate–plate geometry was used with
plate diameters of 6 mm and the gap between plates of 1 mm. The experiments
were conducted under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Oscillatory shear
deformation was applied under conditions of controlled deformation
amplitude, which was kept in the range of the linear viscoelastic
response of the studied samples. The temperature dependencies of the
storage G′ and loss G″
moduli were determined at a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 and a constant deformation frequency of 10 rad s–1. Stress–strain behavior was studied using a Zwick Z005 universal
testing machine equipped with a 50 N force sensor and 200 N clamping
jaws. Dog-bone-shaped samples (with 13 mm gauge length and 2 mm width)
were cut from compression-mold films. Samples were strained at room
temperature and an extension rate of 10 mm min–1. For studying the healing properties, dog-bone samples were cut
with a knife in the middle. The pieces were softened at 60 °C
and reassembled manually and left for 12 h at 100 °C before tensile
testing.

The solution was cooled to 0 °C with an ice bath. Dry dichloromethane
(50 mL) and 1.8 equiv of triethylamine (71 mL, 0.51 mol) and 101.22

funnel, was charged with phosphorus oxychloride (26.87 g, 0.18 mol),
dissolved in dry dichloromethane (60 mL) under an argon atmosphere.
The solution was cooled to 0 °C with an ice bath. Dry dichloromethane
(40 mL) and 2 equiv of triethylamine (48.59 mL, 0.36 mol) and 1.99
equiv (70.05 mL, 0.36 mol) of 10-undecen-1-ol were added over a period
of about 1 h via the dropping funnel. After stirring overnight, the
precipitated triethylammonium hydrochloride was removed by filtration.
The filtrate containing the dialkylene chlorophosphate in dichloromethane
was stirred vigorously, and an excess of water (ca. 100 mL) was added
to the mixture. The acidic aqueous phase was exchanged every day with
fresh water until the reaction was finished. The reaction was acidified
until phase separation occurred. The organic layer was separated from
water and dried with Na2SO4, and the dichloromethane
was evaporated in vacuo. The viscous residue was dissolved in hexane
(100 mL) at room temperature and kept at −20 °C to allow
precipitation. The product was filtered and washed with cold hexane,
and a colorless solid was obtained (yield: 86%, 63.30 g).1H NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3, 298 K): δ = 5.91–5.71

Representative Procedure
for the ADMET Bulk Polymerization of M1 and Copolymerization
with M2 up to 40%
P1
In a vacuum
reactor, M1 (100 g) and
for copolymers the analogue equivalent of M2 and the
Grubbs first-generation catalyst (0.3 mol %) were mixed under an argon
atmosphere. Polymerization was carried out at reduced pressure [first
membrane pump (5 h, 50 mbar) and then oil pump (1 mbar)] to remove
ethylene gas evolving during the metathesis reaction at 65 °C
for 1 h and 85 °C for 16–48 h. The crude mixture was dissolved
in CH2Cl2 and treated with tris-(hydroxymethyl)phosphine
(10 equiv with respect to the catalyst) and 2 mL of Et3N. After being stirred for 1 h, water was added in the same volume
to the organic phase and the solution was stirred overnight. The organic
layer was washed twice with 5% aqueous HCl and brine to remove the
catalyst residue. The water layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 several times until the emulsion disappeared and the
water layer got clear. The combined organic phase was dried over sodium
sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated
at reduced pressure. (Yields typically: 95%). 1H NMR: (300

Representative
Procedure for Catalytic Hydrogenation

A Schlenk
flask was charged with P1 and dissolved in toluene (ca.
12 wt %). The air was removed by reduced
pressure and flushing the reactor with argon. 10% Pd/C catalyst (10

P2-H
P2 (2 g) was dissolved in 40 mL of
toluene/methanol (7:3) at 40 °C and then transferred into a hydrogenation
tube. The polymer solution was degassed for 10 min by bubbling argon
under vigorous stirring. The hydrogenation catalyst precursor [(PCy3)3Cl2Ru=CHOEt]
(4.4 mg; synthesized from Grubbs first-generation catalyst with ethyl
vinyl ether)24 was added and the solution
was again degassed for 2 min. Hydrogenation was then performed in
a high-pressure reactor at 40 °C and 60 bar H2 overnight.
After hydrogenation, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure
to give P2 in quantitative yield. NMR measurement was
done by dissolving 0.1 mL of the reaction mixture before removing
the solvent in 0.5 mL of CDCl3/MeOD (4:2). Dissolving P2-H again was not accessible for any tested solvent. 1H NMR: (300 MHz, CDCl3/CD3OD 4:2, 298
