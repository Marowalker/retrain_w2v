Five neutral bis(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes, [Cu2(LMe,Me,Me)2] (1), [Cu2(LMe,Me,Et)2]·CH2Cl2 (2), [Cu2(Li-Pr,i-Pr,i-Pr)2]·2H2O (3), [Cu2(Lt-Bu,Me,i-Pr)2] (4), and [Cu2(Lt-Bu,t-Bu,i-Pr)2]·H2O (5) have been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal
X-ray
diffraction analyses, magnetic studies, and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, in which the ligands [H2LMe,Me,Me = N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzyl)-N′,N′-dimethylethylene-1,2-diamine,
H2LMe,Me,Et = N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzyl)-N′,N′-dimethylethylene-1,2-diamine, H2Li-Pr,i-Pr,i-Pr = N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-diisopropylbenzyl)-N′,N′-diisopropylethylene-1,2-diamine, H2Lt-Bu,Me,i-Pr = N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylbenzyl)-N′,N′-diisopropylethylene-1,2-diamine, and H2Lt-Bu,t-Bu,i-Pr = N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylbenzyl)-N′,N′-diisopropylethylene-1,2-diamine]
contain the same [O,N,N,O]-donor atoms combination but differ in substituents
at phenol rings and at an amino nitrogen atom. The effect of these
remote substituents on the nature of exchange coupling interactions
(ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic) between the copper(II) ions has
been investigated. The average Cu–O–Cu angle, Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle, and Cu···Cu separation in 1–5 are varied systematically by these remote ligand substituents in
the range 98.6–83.3°, 26.0–46.5°, and 2.982–2.633
Å, respectively. As a result, the intramolecular spin–spin
coupling in these complexes are changing gradually from a strong antiferromagnetic
(J = −395 cm–1, where Ĥ = −JŜ1Ŝ2) to a moderate ferromagnetic
(J = +53.2 cm–1) regime. The crossover
angle at which the magnetic interaction changes from antiferromagnetic
to ferromagnetic (J = 0) is determined to be ca.
87° for this series of dicopper(II) complexes. DFT calculations
support the experimentally determined crossover angle and disclose
various magneto–structural correlations in the series 1–5.

Introduction
Dinuclear
copper(II) complexes with a Cu2O2 core generated
by the bridging hydroxido, alkoxido, and phenoxido
ligands have received wide interest in contemporary coordination chemistry
because of their relevance to bioinorganic chemistry,1 as well as in molecular magnetism.2 Being a d9 system with S = 1/2 ground
state, the magnetic behavior of copper(II) complexes is relatively
easier to handle, both from experimental and theoretical points of
view.3 Bleaney and Bowers derived a theoretical
expression for the magnetic exchange coupling in dinuclear copper(II)
compounds for the first time4 and used
that expression to explain magnetic properties and EPR signatures
of a dimeric copper(II) acetate.5

Numerous exchange-coupled bi- and polynuclear transition-metal
complexes have since been extensively studied in order to determine
magneto–structural correlations,6 which could ultimately lead to the rational design of novel materials
with desired magnetic properties. Thus, a linear correlation between
the exchange coupling constant (J) and CuII–O–CuII bridge angle (θ) within a
family of planar dihydroxido-bridged dicopper(II) complexes was demonstrated.7 A transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
coupling (J = 0) was predicted to occur at θ
≈ 97°. The phenomenon is believed to be due to an “accidental
orthogonality” of two copper-based magnetic orbitals resulting
in a spin triplet ground state with minimized interelectronic repulsion.
A similar correlation has been reported also for the alkoxo-bridged
dicopper(II) complexes.8,9 Indeed, several theoretical approaches
have been employed to investigate the magnetic behavior of dicopper
complexes and provide the structure–properties correlation
starting by the purely qualitative approach involving the estimation
of the energy splitting and finishing by more complex ab initio methods.10

Although many structurally characterized
bis(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes are known, except for few examples,11−13 the copper(II)
ions in dimers are almost exclusively antiferromagnetically coupled.14 There are some scattered investigations on a
series of bis(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II) complexes14c,15 that reveal exclusively antiferromagnetic coupling. Thus, Thompson
et al.15 reported a linear relationship
between the exchange coupling constant and phenoxide bridge Cu–OPh–Cu
angle (θ). The extrapolation of the data to the ferromagnetic
regime yielded the crossover point (J = 0) at θ
≈ 77°, which is well below the angle reported for dihydroxido
and dialkoxido complexes.7−9 Sillanpää et al.14c proposed a more realistic crossover angle,
θ, of 89°, extrapolating the antiferromagnetic coupling
in a series of diphenoxido complexes toward the ferromagnetic regime.13b Thus, the lack of compounds exhibiting ferromagnetic
coupling constitutes a serious obstacle for the proper investigation
of magneto–structural correlations, as reported for hydroxido-
and alkoxo-bridged complexes.7−9 A series of bis(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes revealing both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling
would be desired for precise magneto–structural correlations.

We have an ongoing project on the chemistry and reactivity of transition-metal
complexes involving phenol-based ligands.16,17 Herein, we report a new family of bis-(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes, 1–5, including five structurally similar
tetradentate diphenol ligands (Scheme 1). Different sets of ligand substituents exert different
steric pressure on the participating copper centers, which allows
a large modulation of both structural parameters and magnetic properties
in the series. Ultimately, we have been able to obtain antiferromagnetically
and ferromagnetically spin-coupled complexes and, consequently, derive
a precise magneto–structural correlation in bis-(μ-phenoxido)dicopper
species. The structural requirements for a crossover point (J = 0) have been determined precisely by interpolating magnetic
data for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were also made to understand the magneto–structural correlations.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Iminodiphenol Ligands
Experimental Section
Materials
All reactions were carried
out in aerobic
environment with chemicals available from commercial sources and used
as received. The solvents were reagent grade, dried by standard procedure,18 and distilled under nitrogen before use. The
tetradentate bis-phenol ligands were prepared following a reported
procedure19 with minor modification. The
protocol involves a Mannich-type condensation reaction between a 2,4-substituted
dialkylphenol and N,N-dialkyl ethylenediamine
as outlined below. Altogether, five ligands have been synthesized,
all having N2O2 donor combination but differ
among themselves by the steric hindrance offered by the substituents,
R1, R2, and R3 combinations, which
is systematically varied in going from H2LMe,Me,Me to H2Lt-Bu,t-Bu,i-Pr as summarized in Scheme 1.

Synthesis of
Ligands
A modified procedure for the synthesis
of N,N-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzyl)-N′,N′-dimethylethylene-1,2-diamine, (H2LMe,Me,Me) is described here as a prototype. To a solution
of 2,4-dimethyl phenol (2.44 g, 20 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) were
added N,N-dimethylethylenediamine
(0.88 g, 10 mmol) and paraformaldehyde (60 mg, 20 mmol). The resulting
solution was refluxed for 15 h. It was then cooled to room temperature
and rotary evaporated to ca. 10 mL volume. The resulting white precipitate
was filtered off, washed with 20 mL of cold methanol and recrystallized
from dichloromethane/methanol (1:1 v/v) mixture. Yield: 80%; mp 174

[Cu2(LMe,Me,Me)2] (1). The ligand H2LMe,Me,Me (89 mg, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in methanol
(30 mL). To this were added Et3N (68 μL, 0.50 mmol)
and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (90 mg, 0.25
mmol). The resulting dark brown solution was refluxed for 2 h and
filtered over a Celite bed. The filtrate solution was left in the
air for slow evaporation. The product was obtained as a brown crystalline
solid within 2–3 days. The crystals were filtered off, washed
with cold methanol, and air dried. Some of these crystals were of
diffraction quality and used directly for X-ray crystal structure
analysis. Yield: 70 mg (65%). Anal. Calcd for C44H60N4O4Cu2: C, 63.21; H, 7.23;

Physical Measurements
IR spectroscopic measurements
were made on samples pressed into KBr pellets using a Shimadzu 8400S
FT-IR spectrometer, whereas for UV–visible spectral measurements,
a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer was employed.
Elemental analyses (for C, H, and N) were performed at IACS on a PerkinElmer
model 2400 Series II CHNS Analyzer. The electrospray ionization mass
spectra (ESI-MS) in the positive ion mode were measured on a Micromass
QTOF model YA 263 mass spectrometer. The 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker model AVANCE DPX-400 spectrometer using
SiMe4 as the internal reference. Magnetic susceptibility
data were collected with a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer
working between 1.8 and 350 K with the magnetic field up to 7 T. The
data were corrected for the sample holder and the diamagnetic contributions
calculated from Pascal’s constants.21

Theoretical Calculations
Program ORCA 4.0.0.2 was used
for all spin-unrestricted DFT calculations.22 The calculations were performed on molecular structures as obtained
from crystallography without further optimizations. Single point calculations
were conducted with B3LYP functional23,24 using def2-SVP
and def2-TZVP basis sets25 for C/H and
non-C/H atoms, respectively. RIJCOSX approximation with appropriate
auxiliary basis sets (def2/J)26 were employed
for all calculations. Magnetic coupling was analyzed using broken-symmetry
formalism.27−29 Corresponding orbitals were used to visualize molecular
magnetic orbitals.30 Molecular orbitals
and spin density maps were visualized with Molekel.31

X-ray Crystallography
Suitable crystals
of 1 (brown block, 0.14 × 0.12 × 0.08 mm3), 2 (brown block, 0.16 × 0.12 × 0.09
mm3), 3 (brown block, 0.10 × 0.09 ×
0.08 mm3), 4 (brown block, 0.16 × 0.15
× 0.10
mm3), and 5 (brown block, 0.12 × 0.08
× 0.06 mm3) were mounted on glass fibers coated with
perfluoropolyether oil before mounting. Intensity data for the aligned
crystals were measured employing a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer
equipped with a monochromatized Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å) source at 150(2) K except for compound 2, which
was measured at 293(2) K. No crystal decay was observed during the
data collections. In all cases, absorption corrections based on multiscans
using the SADABS software32 were applied.
The structures were solved by direct methods33 and refined on F2 by a full-matrix least-squares
procedure based on all data minimizing wR = [∑[w(F02 – Fc2)2]/∑(F02)2]1/2, R = ∑||F0| – |Fc||/∑|F0|, and S = [∑[w(F02 – Fc2)2]/(n – p)]1/2. SHELXL-2013 was used for both structure solutions and refinements.34 A summary of the relevant crystallographic data
and the final refinement details are given in Table 1. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
The hydrogen atoms were calculated and isotropically fixed in the
final refinement [d(C–H) = 0.95 Å, with
the isotropic thermal parameter of Uiso(H) = 1.2Uiso(C)]. The SMART and SAINT
software packages35 were used for data
collection and reduction, respectively. Crystallographic diagrams
were drawn using the DIAMOND software package.36

Results
and Discussion
Syntheses
Five tetradenate amino-bis
phenol ligands
(H2LR1,R2,R3) with closely related structures
have been synthesized in moderate to high yields by Mannich type of
condensation reaction between N,N dialkylethylenediamine and 2,4-dialkylphenol (Scheme 1). These ligands in aerobic environment (with
the exception of H2LMe,Me,Et) combine with Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O in refluxing methanol in
the presence of an added base (NEt3) to generate the neutral
bis-(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II) complexes (1, 3–5) having a planar Cu2O2 core
(Scheme 2) as revealed
from X-ray crystallography (vide infra). We have failed to isolate
compound 2 in the crystalline form following the same
procedure using the ligand H2LMe,Me,Et. Interestingly,
however, when Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O
was replaced by CuCl2·2H2O as the metal
ion precursor, we were able to isolate 2 in the crystalline
form.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Scheme for Bis(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II) Complexes 1–5
The Cu(II) centers in compounds 1 and 2 present a square pyramidal geometry. We have deliberately
chosen
to introduce three different substituents R1, R2, and R3 in the ligand framework in order to influence
the coordination geometry around the individual copper centers. Such
strategy appears to be successful because the copper centers in the
later three compounds, 3, 4, and 5, appear to be square planar (Scheme 2), as one of the donor amino nitrogen atoms is forced
to stay away from coordination due to larger steric constraints exerted
by a bulky R3 substituent, such as i-Pr.
Similarly, the remaining substituents R1 and R2 attached to the phenolate rings of the coordinated ligands also
have their cumulative influence on the crystal structures of compounds 1 and 3–5. Juxtaposition of the steric
influence of all these substituents has an overall effect in tuning
the average Cu–O–Cu bridge angles in the reported compounds.

Description of Crystal Structures
A slightly different
crystal structure of compound [Cu2(LMe,Me,Me)2] 1 was reported earlier.37 The methodology adopted for the synthesis of that compound
was also different. In our hand, the complex crystallizes in the orthorhombic
space group Pnna with four molecular mass units accommodated
per unit cell. The molecule has a two-fold symmetry and the asymmetric
unit contains half of the complex molecule, that is, one crystallographic
copper site. A perspective view of the molecular structure of 1 is displayed in Figure S1 (in the Supporting Information), and the relevant metrical parameters along with
those of compounds 2–5 are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The coordination geometry around the individual copper center
is distorted square pyramidal with a τ parameter38 of 0.23. The basal plane around the Cu center
is completed by the phenolate oxygen atom O1, bridging phenolate oxygen
O2 and the amino nitrogen atom N1, all coming from the tetradented
N2O2 ligand along with the bridging phenolate
oxygen O2′, coming from another ligand attached to the adjacent
metal center. The apical site is coordinated by the remaining amino
nitrogen atom N2 of the N2O2 ligand. The basal
planes around the adjacent copper atoms (Cu1, O1, O2, N1, and O2′
plane) form a folded geometry with a roof angle of 58.55°. The
phenyl rings are rotated with respect to the Cu2O2 plane and form a dihedral angle of 56.75°. The intramolecular
Cu···Cu separation and the Cu1–O–Cu2
bridge angle of the Cu2O2 core are 2.9822(16)
Å and 98.63(17)°, respectively. The trans angles O1–Cu1–O3
(165.15(18)°) and O2–Cu1–N1 (151.36(19)°)
in the basal plane are appreciably short of linearity, indicating
a slightly compressed basal plane and the Cu ions are displaced out
(by 0.248 Å) of these planes toward the apical nitrogen atoms.
The crystal packing analysis indicates that the shortest Cu···Cu
intermolecular distance is equal to 8.339(2) Å, confirming that
the complexes are well isolated.

Compound [Cu2(LMe,Me,Et)2]·CH2Cl22 crystallizes
in the triclinic
space group P1̅ with two complexes per unit
cell, which also contains one dichloromethane molecule as solvent
of crystallization. The asymmetric unit of 2 consists
of a dinuclear Cu2L2 molecule with two phenolate
O atoms acting as a (μ-O)2 bridge between the crystallographically
independent metal centers. The H2LMe,Me,Et ligand
coordinates as an (LMe,Me,Et)2– anion
in a tetradentate/bridging manner through the two phenolate oxygen
atoms and nitrogen atoms of the amino groups. A perspective view of
the molecular structure is presented in Figure 1. The coordination geometry around the two
copper atoms is distorted square pyramidal with τ values38 of 0.35 and 0.09 for Cu1 and Cu2, respectively,
indicating different degrees of distortion around the two metal sites.
The basal plane around the copper atom Cu1 is completed by one phenolate
oxygen O1, one amino nitrogen N1, and two bridging phenolate oxygen
atoms O2 and O3. Corresponding donor atoms around Cu2 are O4, N3,
O3, and O2, respectively. The apical site around these metal centers
is taken up by the remaining amino nitrogen N2 and N4. The distances
of the axial N atoms from the metal centers Cu1 and Cu2 are 2.503(3)
and 2.429(2) Å, respectively, which are more elongated compared
to the corresponding distance 2.392(5) Å found in complex 1. The observed dihedral angle (61.73°) between the two
basal planes indicates a folded syn-clinical arrangement. The Cu1
and Cu2 atoms are displaced from their respective basal planes by
0.290 and 0.241 Å, respectively. The intramolecular Cu···Cu
separation and the average Cu1–O–Cu2 bridge angle of
the Cu2O2 core are 2.993(4) Å and 97.92°,
respectively. The average dihedral bridge angle between the phenoxo
plane and Cu2O2 plane is 58.48°. The shortest
Cu···Cu intermolecular distance is longer than in 1 and equal to 12.820(7) Å.

Compound [Cu2(Li-Pr,i-Pr,i-Pr)2]·2H2O 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic
space group P21/c with four molecular mass units accommodated per unit cell.
It contains two water molecules as solvent of crystallization. A perspective
view of the molecular structure of 3 is displayed in Figure 2a. Unlike the previous
two compounds, the ligands coordinate in a tridentate/bridging manner
to the individual copper centers. The steric constraints of the bulkier
isopropyl groups enforce the amino nitrogen atoms N2 and N4 of the
ligands (Figure 2a)
to stay away from coordination. The Cu centers, thus, have square
planar geometry in this compound. Its relevant metrical parameters
are summarized in Table 2. The basal plane around the copper atoms are completed by one phenolate
oxygen, one amine nitrogen, and two bridging phenolate oxygen atoms
[O1, N1, O2, and O3 around Cu1 and O2, O3, O4, and N3 around Cu2].
The trans angles at the copper centers lying in the range of 165.4–170.0°
indicate a distorted square-planar nature of the metal ion geometry.
The dihedral angle between the two basal planes around the copper
atoms is 46.98° (Figure 2b). The intramolecular Cu···Cu separation and
the average Cu1–O–Cu2 angle of the Cu2O2 core are 2.866(2) Å and 94.39°, respectively. The
Cu1 and Cu2 atoms are displaced from the basal planes by 0.013 and
0.055 Å, respectively. The average dihedral angle between the
phenoxo plane and Cu2O2 plane for this molecule
is 51.26°. The shortest Cu···Cu intermolecular
distance is found to be equal to 10.598(3) Å.

Compound [Cu2(Lt-Bu,Me,i-Pr)2] 4 crystallizes
in the triclinic space group P1̅ with two complexes
accommodated per unit cell. A perspective view of the molecular structure
of 4 is displayed in Figure 3. Important metrical parameters are presented
in Table 2. Here also,
the coordination geometry around the two copper centers is distorted
square planar and the trans angles around the copper centers in the
basal planes vary from 165.32 to 169.32°. The dihedral angle
of 76.55° between the two basal planes also indicates a folded syn-clinical arrangement. The Cu(1) and Cu(2) ions are displaced
from the basal planes by 0.150 and 0.158 Å, respectively. The
intramolecular Cu···Cu separation and the average Cu1–O–Cu2
angle of the Cu2O2 core are 2.7204(4) Å
and 86.945°, respectively. The average dihedral angle between
the phenoxo plane and Cu2O2 plane for this molecule
is 73.36°, whereas the shortest Cu···Cu intermolecular
distance is equal to 11.876(1) Å.

Compound [Cu2(Lt-Bu,t-Bu,i-Pr)2]·H2O 5 crystallizes in the monoclinic
space group C2/c with eight molecular
mass units accommodated per unit cell. This compound has an almost
similar structure (Figure S2) as that of
complex 4. The influence of the associated dianionic
ligand H2Lt-Bu,t-Bu,i-Pr with bulkier substituent
combination has important ramifications on the overall structural
parameters as summarized in Table 2. The dihedral angle between the two basal planes around
copper atoms is 80.96°. The intramolecular Cu···Cu
separation and the average Cu1–O–Cu2 angle of the Cu2O2 core are 2.633(1) Å and 83.27°, respectively.
The latter value is probably the shortest Cu–O–Cu bridge
angle, reported thus far in the literature for a bis(μ-phenoxido)
dicopper(II) complex. The average dihedral angle between the phenoxo
plane and Cu2O2 plane for this molecule is 68.69°.
The Cu1 and Cu2 atoms are displaced from the basal planes by 0.147
and 0.149 Å, respectively, whereas the shortest Cu···Cu
intermolecular distance is 11.010(1) Å.

A gradual increase
in the steric bulk of the substituents on the
ligand’s N atom enforces the Cu centers in these dinuclear
copper complexes to adopt a square planar geometry in 3–5 instead of a square pyramidal geometry observed in 1 and 2. The combinations of substituents, thus, have
a modest to large influence in tuning the Cu···Cu separations,
bridging Cu–O–Cu bond angles, and hinge distortion of
the Cu2O2 framework (Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle) as summarized in Table 3.

Electronic Spectra
Electronic spectra
of these compounds
were recorded in dichloromethane solution. All complexes exhibit strong
absorption bands in 412–434 nm region due to phenolate to metal
charge-transfer transitions.39 Much weaker
bands in 636–661 nm region were assigned to d–d transitions39 (Figure 4). Upon increasing the steric crowding of the substituents
at the phenol ring, the ligand to metal charge-transfer band exhibits
a bathochromic shift (Table 4) due to an enhanced charge transfer from phenolate to metal
ion concomitant with the increase of the inductive effect.

Magnetic Properties
Magnetic properties of the complexes 1–5 were investigated using a SQUID magnetometer working
between 1.8 and 350 K up to 7 T. The temperature dependence of χT for all compounds is reported in Figure 5. The room temperature χT values are equal to 0.39, 0.49, 0.70, 0.84, and 0.81 cm3 mol–1 K for compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
For compounds 4 and 5, these values are
in good agreement with the theoretical value of 0.82 cm3 mol–1 K expected for two noninteracting copper(II)
ions (S = 1/2; g = 2.1). In the
case of the three former compounds, 1–3, the observed lower χT values originate from
the occurrence of antiferromagnetic interactions, which are still
operative at room temperature. Such fact is further confirmed by the
decrease of χT upon cooling, reflecting strong
dominant antiferromagnetic interactions. At low temperature, the zero
χT value for complexes 1–3 points out a diamagnetic ground state. In contrast, the temperature
dependence of χT for complexes 4 and 5 shows a positive deviation upon cooling due to
the presence of ferromagnetic interactions to reach a maximum close
to 10 K before decreasing at low temperature, most likely because
of intermolecular interactions. The maximum χT values of 1.13 and 1.02 cm3 mol–1 K
for 4 and 5, respectively, are close to
the value of 1.10 cm3 mol–1 K expected
for a S = 1 species (g = 2.1) resulting
from a ferromagnetic coupling between the spin carriers. Such ferromagnetic
interaction is ultimately confirmed by monitoring the field dependence
of magnetization at 1.8 K (Figure 6), which can be fitted with a Brillouin function for
a S = 1 species (g = 2.30 ±
0.02 and 2.10 ± 0.02 for 4 and 5, respectively).

correspond to the fit using PHI.

To get further details, the exchange
interaction between the two
Cu(II) ions can be extracted using the isotropic Hamiltonian, Ĥ = −JŜ1Ŝ2, leading to the well-known
Bleaney–Blowers equation.5 Using
the PHI software,40 the thermal dependence
of χT as well as the magnetization curves for 4 and 5 were fitted. Note that for 4 and 5, an intermolecular interaction parameter was
taken into account, whereas for 2, both a temperature-independent
paramagnetism (TIP) contribution and intermolecular parameter were
taken into account. The parameters from the best fits are reported
in Table 5. It could
be noticed that for compound 2, the weak value of the
gyromagnetic factor may reflect the presence of a small diamagnetic
impurity. Yet, the slope of χT versus T being mainly affected by the exchange interaction, the
extracted constant could be considered as meaningful.

The nature of the magnetic exchange interactions in phenoxido dinuclear
complexes has been largely studied.14a Thus,
there are several parameters affecting the magnitude and sign of the J parameter, such as, the value of Cu–O–Cu
angle, the Cu···Cu and Cu–O distances,41 as well as the distortion of the copper ion
geometry,42 the effect of the asymmetry
in the Cu–hydroxo bond, and the out-of-plane displacement of
the hydrogen atoms of the hydroxo-bridge.9 Noticeably, there are only limited examples of phenoxido-bridged
dinuclear copper complexes that exhibit ferromagnetic interactions.11−13 It appears that one of the main factors controlling the sign of
the exchange interactions is the Cu–O–Cu bridging angle,
which is correlated with the geometry of the Cu(II) ion.12,14c,43 In the case of hydroxo-bridged
dicopper(II) complexes, it was experimentally evidenced that J varies linearly with this bridging angle through the Hatfield
and Hodgson relationship.7a A transition
from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic coupling is therefore expected
for a Cu–O–Cu angle smaller than 97°.

In
the wide majority of the reported phenoxido systems, the magnetic
interaction is found to be antiferromagnetic due to the important
bridging angle. Thus, the complexes 1–3 exhibit
common antiferromagnetic interactions with the magnitude of J, which increases as the Cu–O–Cu angle increases.
Reducing this angle induces the switching to moderate ferromagnetic
interactions as shown in Figure 7 with a linear plot (involving experimental data in
blue squares). In our present systems, the crossover point is found
for the Cu–O–Cu angle (θ) at 87° (Figure 7). This value is
in good agreement with the value of 90° that was previously reported.11 However, we would like to point out that the
strength of this ferromagnetic coupling is way larger than in other
reported complexes because of the smaller Cu–O–Cu angle
in our systems. This can be ascribed to short Cu···Cu
distance and a large hinge distortion of the Cu2O2 core leading to large Cu–O–Cu–O torsion angle
(the average dihedral angle between the Cu2O2 plane and the bridging phenoxy aromatic ring plane). A switch from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic regime in our series can be estimated
to occur at the Cu···Cu distance of 2.71 Å (Figure S3) and at Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle of 42° (Figure S4).
It could, however, be noticed that below the crossing point, the magnitude
of the ferromagnetic interaction is less dependent on the angle’s
change.

Figure 7 Correlation of experimentally and theoretically determined exchange
coupling constant J with Cu–O–Cu angle
in 1–5. Blue squares: experimental data; red circles:
theoretical data. Best fitted line is drawn between the experimentally
determined coupling constant and Cu–O–Cu angle (R2 = 0.9).

Of particular interest in compounds 1–5 are the different alkyl substituents (R1, R2, and R3) with
similar Hammet parameters in their ligand frameworks that support
a high quality correlation, spanning a transformation from antiferro-to
ferromagnetic range. Ruiz and co-workers9b found that besides the Cu–O–Cu angle, other structural
features may highly impact the magnetic coupling in dinuclear copper-based
compounds such as the out-of-plane displacement of the hydrogen atoms
of the hydroxo bridge, asymmetry in the Cu2O2 unit, as well as a hinge distortion. Indeed, they demonstrated an
interesting correlation between the Cu–O–Cu angle and
out-of-plane angle of the hydroxo bridge in certain hydroxo- and alkoxo-bridged
Cu(II) binuclear complexes. In the case of 1–5, the out-of-plane angle is almost the same. However, the
torsion Cu–O–Cu–O angles are quite different
and impact the magnetic interactions. This last aspect is discussed
in the next section.

Theoretical Calculations and Magneto–Structural
Correlations
DFT calculations were performed on complexes 1–5. The exchange coupling constants were calculated
using a broken-symmetry
approach.27−29 To preserve all subtle geometrical features that
can heavily influence spin coupling, calculations were performed using
molecular structures as determined by X-ray crystallography (vide
supra) without optimization.

The calculated antiferromagnetic
coupling constants in 1–3 are in excellent agreement
with experimentally obtained values (Table 6). Although we were able to reproduce ferromagnetic
coupling in 4 and 5, its strength is underestimated
in our calculations. In spite of considerably differing molecular
structures in the series 1–5, the Cu–Cu
coupling seems to correlate with a Cu–O–Cu angle. Similarly,
to related species,14c a roughly linear
correlation (involving the red circles) can be obtained, also displayed
in Figure 7 for a comparison
with the experimental plot. Thus, a crossing point of 86° corresponding
to the change of the sign of the coupling constant has been obtained
in our calculations. This value is in very good agreement with the
experimentally obtained correlation (at 87°) and previously reported
data on related species.14c

Interestingly, the coupling in 1–5 correlates
with a hinge distortion of the Cu2O2 core expressed
as a Cu–O–Cu–O torsion angle. Actually, a linear
correlation between the coupling constant J and Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle of similar quality has been obtained in this case (Figure 8). Our results are
in line with previous works on bis(μ-phenoxido)14a and bis(μ-hydroxido)9bdicopper(II) complexes, where the increasing hinge distortion
resulted in the shift of the Cu···Cu coupling from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic regime.

Figure 8 Correlation of calculated
exchange coupling constant J and Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle with Cu–O–Cu
angle in 1–5. Blue squares: coupling constant
(R2 = 0.997); red circles: torsion angle
(R2 = 0.94).

Because both Cu–O–Cu angle and Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle correlate with J, these two structural
parameters should correlate with each other. Indeed, an excellent
linear correlation (R2 = 0.995) between
the two angles could be obtained as also depicted in Figure 8. Thus, although both the decrease
of Cu–O–Cu angle and the increase of Cu–O–Cu–O
torsion angle are known to promote ferromagnetic coupling in bis(phenoxido)-bridged
dicopper(II) complexes,14a here, we have
disclosed a correlation between those structural parameters for the
first time. Furthermore, we have analyzed the geometry of all similar
known bis(phenoxido)dicopper complexes that are nonplanar: they feature
phenylene–CH2–N(R)–CH2–phenoxides
and Cu–O–Cu–O torsion angles of nonzero. A similar
linear correlation, albeit of lower quality (R2 = 0.88), has been obtained for those data (Figure. S5). The fit is exceptionally good for structures
with Cu–O–Cu–O angles higher than 10° and
Cu–O–Cu angles lower than 100°. For more flat structures
with Cu–O–Cu–O angles below 10°, the data
become spread significantly.

The antiferromagnetic coupling
between two copper d(x2 – y2) type orbitals
in 1–3 is promoted by superexchange interactions
through in-plane p-orbitals of bridging oxygen atoms (Figures 9, S6, and S7). Such antiferromagnetic coupling is common for this
class of compounds.14a However, relatively
strong ferromagnetic coupling in 4 and 5 is rather unusual. Here, antiferromagnetic pathway by superexchange
via bridging oxygen becomes significantly diminished (Figures 10 and S8). Besides decreased Cu–O–Cu angle that generally
leads to ferromagnetic coupling, a large hinge distortion of the Cu2O2 core renders the two NOCuOO coordination planes
strongly tilted to each other. In the extreme case, with the dihedral
angle between the two NOCuOO planes attaining 90°, the antiferromagnetic
pathway via superexchange vanishes completely, which should lead to
very strong ferromagnetic coupling (Figure 11). In our case, significantly tilted NOCuOO
coordination planes at 76.6 and 81.0° lead to relatively strong
ferromagnetic coupling in 4 and 5, respectively.
Thus, both structural parameters, small Cu–O–Cu angle
and large Cu–O–Cu–O torsion angle in bis(phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes, are indicative of ferromagnetic coupling, which is in agreement
with previous correlations.14a

Conclusions
We have reported the synthesis and systematic
variation of exchange
coupling constant (J) in a series of bis-(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes, 1–5, featuring tetradentate aminodiphenol
H2LR1,R2,R3 ligands in which the ligands contain
the same [O,N,N,O] donor atoms but differ in substituents at phenol
rings (R1, R2) and at an amine nitrogen atom (R3). The substituents
are changed from methyl to tert-butyl on the phenol
rings and from methyl to isopropyl at the amine nitrogen atom, thus
exerting different steric pressures on the participating copper centers.
Among the substituents, R1 and R2 play a crucial role in tuning the
Cu–O–Cu angle, Cu···Cu separation, and
Cu–O–Cu–O torsion angle, whereas R3 controls
the geometry around copper ions, changing from square pyramidal to
square planar. Because of the fine tuning of structural parameters
via ligand substituents, complexes 1–3 exhibit
antiferromagnetic coupling, whereas 4 and 5 reveal ferromagnetic exchange. Thus, the average Cu–O–Cu
bond angle, Cu–O–Cu–O torsion angle, and Cu···Cu
separation are varied gradually within the 1–5 series in the range 98.6–83.3°, 26.0–46.5°,
and 2.982–2.633 Å, respectively. As a result, spin coupling
changes gradually from strong antiferromagnetic (J = −395 cm–1) to moderate ferromagnetic
(J = +53.2 cm–1) values. The crossover
point at which the magnetic coupling is changed (J = 0) is determined at ca. 87°. Interestingly, 5 has the lowest Cu···Cu separation (2.633 Å)
and smallest Cu–O–Cu bond angle (83.3°), and consequently,
a large ferromagnetic coupling constant (J = +53.2
cm–1) has been reported thus far for bis(μ-phenoxido)dicopper(II)
complexes. The results of DFT calculations are in agreement with the
experimentally determined crossover angle and disclose excellent magneto–structural
correlations in the series 1–5.
