Mixed halide (I/Br) complex organic/inorganic
hybrid perovskite
materials have attracted much attention recently because of their
excellent photovoltaic properties. Although it has been proposed that
their stability is linked to the chemical inhomogeneity of I/Br, no
direct proof has been offered to date. Here, we report a new method,
secondary electron hyperspectral imaging (SEHI), which allows direct
imaging of the local variation in Br concentration in mixed halide
(I/Br) organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites on a nanometric scale.
We confirm the presence of a nonuniform Br distribution with variation
in concentration within the grain interiors and boundaries and demonstrate
how SEHI in conjunction with low-voltage scanning electron microscopy
can enhance the understanding of the fundamental physics and materials
science of organic/inorganic hybrid photovoltaics, illustrating its
potential for research and development in “real-world”
applications.

1 Introduction
Metal
halide organic/inorganic perovskite photovoltaic materials
that crystallize with an ABX3 structure have attracted
intense academic and industrial attention for optoelectronic applications.1−4 In this ABX3 structure, A, B, and X are monovalent cations
[methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), and cesium (Cs)], divalent
cations (Pb and Sn), and halide anions (I, Cl, and Br), respectively.5−7 Of the various organic/inorganic perovskite materials, methylammonium
lead triiodide (MAPbI3) is the most studied material for
photovoltaic devices.8 However, focus has
now shifted towards solid solutions of hybrid perovskite materials
with multiple A- and X-site species to enhance stability against ambient
moisture9,10 and to improve the photovoltaic properties.5,8 As a consequence, the structural, thermal, and photovoltaic properties
of mixed I/Br perovskites have been widely investigated.11,12 Nevertheless, conclusions regarding local halide composition and
distribution remain speculative even though they are considered responsible
for charge carrier recombination by creating trapped states13 that collectively affect the optoelectronic
performance.14

As it has been established
that the structure and composition of
heavily mixed hybrid perovskites (HPs) is very complex because of
the occurrence of spontaneous spinodal decomposition, amorphous impurities,
and related nanoscale phase segregation,15 a novel, fast microscopy technique that can reveal such variations
in films and real devices is urgently called for.16 This is to enable further advances in the device performance.
Therefore, here we introduce a fast hyperspectral imaging technique
based on the secondary electron (SE) signal in a low-voltage (LV)
scanning electron microscope. Hyperspectral imaging is the integration
of conventional imaging and spectroscopy to attain both spatial and
spectral information.17 Because we integrate
the SE spectroscopy with SE imaging, we refer to this method as secondary
electron hyperspectral imaging (SEHI) in which carefully selected
spectral window(s) within the overall SE signal is used to reveal
the presence of nanoscale inhomogeneities in Br composition in the
lateral direction and across the film thickness with a sub-10 nm resolution.
In addition, SEHI enables the observation and identification of nanosized
local regions with excess organic material in complex organolead mixed-halide
perovskite films that resemble device structures. Thus, we find that
SEHI enables direct observation of several nanoscale features in organolead
mixed-halide perovskites, which cannot be revealed using conventional
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), LV-SEM, or any other analytical
technique because of the different constrains of many standard analytical
techniques, as summarized below.

Currently, energy dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy is the main
analytical tool inside of a scanning electron microscope for elemental
mapping;18,19 however, this technique is limited because of its spatial resolution,
which is typically about 1 μm, and is not suitable for materials
that require lower electron beam energy (≤1 kV) because there
is insufficient energy to excite characteristic X-rays. Even for electron
beam energies typically used for EDX, organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite
photovoltaic materials, without the application of any top conductive
coating, suffer damage during irradiation due to because of a combination
of the intensity (typically 86 pA) and kinetic energy (at 10 keV)
of the electrons.20

Halides are particularly difficult to detect using
standard scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) imaging techniques, where typically a high-energy
electron beam is used as the primary source of excitation, giving
rise to excitation of surface atoms, which provides energy for dissociation,
desorption, and chemical reactions. The cross section for electron-stimulated
dissociation of nominally gaseous species ranges from 10–15 cm2 down to unmeasurably small values,21 with halides exhibiting the highest values and therefore
making these difficult to detect. Nevertheless, a gradient between
Br and I concentration over a length of several micrometers can be
mapped using SEM-EDX, as recently demonstrated.22

Imaging of chemical variations on the submicron scale,
without
the application of a conductive coating, requires a radically different
approach that allows the minimization of both incident beam energy
and beam current. This can be realized by exploiting the SE signal.
This approach enables imaging with a high resolution and minimum damage
in a situation where the atomic number contrast between the mixed
components of the perovskite photovoltaic materials is too low in
conventional SEM to provide information about the spatial distribution
of, for example, the anion species. The overall SE signal consists
of contributions from both SE1 and SE2.23,24 SEs generated
directly by the incident primary electrons through inelastic interactions
with the electrons of the material to be analyzed are known as SE1
and carry high-resolution, surface-specific information about the
electronic structure of the material. SE2 are produced by electrons
scattered elastically by the nuclei of the atoms present in the material
prior to SE generation. Although the SE2 signal contains average atomic
number contrast and is 2–3 times the magnitude of the SE1 signal,20 it provides a limited resolution in an SE image
in conventional SEM. Furthermore, the average atomic number changes
only slightly when I is partially replaced by Br (change of <2
for [PbI3]− and [PbI2Br]−) compared with that on the incorporation of Cs (where
the change in the average atomic number is almost 20). Hence, the
image contrast in conventional SEM of complex triple-cation organic/inorganic
hybrid perovskites25 is dominated by the
average atomic number contrast arising from Cs, thus obscuring Br
variations. Here, we demonstrate that SE2 can be suppressed (filtered)
to generate an image contrast based on SE1, which may then be used
to map changes in the local electronic properties (bandgap) with a
high spatial resolution. This can be exploited to map Br distributions
because the difference in the bandgap on substituting I with Br is
substantial (bandgap of MAPbI3 is 1.7 eV compared with
2.3 eV for MAPbBr3).26 By contrast,
the substitution of Cs for MA and FA ions results in a bandgap change
of only 0.02 eV.27

Energy filtering
is already widely used in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) to enhance chemical contrast and provide direct compositional
information, with a lateral resolution of 1–2 nm.28,29 However, this technique relies on the ability to prepare electron
transparent samples that do not sustain damage during irradiation
under a high-voltage, intensely focused electron beam. Preparation of TEM samples from organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite
materials is difficult, and images within the literature are principally
of powders and films at a low resolution with no high-quality chemical
analysis at the requisite spatial resolution.30 Such a limitation, of course, does not apply in cases of nanoparticles
without any organic component and does not require an additional sample
preparation. In fact, if the nanoparticles are small enough, an indication
of atomic columns can be seen in the EDX maps of the nonvolatile components,
as was demonstrated on the maps of Cs and Pb taken from the CsPbBr3 nanoparticles.31

An alternative
is ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS),
which provides quantitative information about the valence band region
and interfaces, but its spatial resolution is poor because ultraviolet
lamps illuminate a large area (1 mm2).32,33 Micro-Raman spectroscopy has also been used to probe the Br to I
concentration ratio in an organic/inorganic mixed halide photovoltaic
material.34

However, laser-induced
degradation cannot be avoided, and its resolution
is insufficient to map intragranular variations in the halide concentration.
Conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) has also been used to map
intragranular open circuit voltage and short circuit current homogeneity
in Cl- and I-based perovskites. The observed voltage and current values
were nonuniform, and variations were related to the facet-dependent
density of the trapped states.35 Photoluminescence
(PL), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and HIM-SIMS (helium ion
microscope coupled with secondary ion mass spectrometer) are other
techniques used to map Cl concentration and hypothesize the presence
of Cl on the surface,36 but they have a
limited lateral spatial resolution and cannot assess the distribution
as a function of film thickness.37 Here,
we present a solution to address the challenge of characterizing the
nonuniform distribution (segregation) of Br in photovoltaic-applicable
perovskite materials using SEHI and further demonstrate on fracture
surfaces of the photovoltaics film, sub-10 nm resolution and high
chemical contrast images, illustrating the Br distribution. However,
no Br-related chemical contrast would be expected if Br was distributed
uniformly throughout the material.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Origin of SE Peaks in SE
Spectra
SEHI has never been used to characterize perovskite
solar cell materials
and is not well-understood even for much simpler materials such as
metals.38 We first identify the origin
of the SE emission spectra, with the aim of mapping halide distributions
in mixed cation [Cs and formamidinium iodide (FAI)]-based and halide
(I/Br)-based organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites.

Collecting
SE spectra of a number of materials used in such devices allows some
insight into which particular energy regions are suitable to map chemical
distributions while suppressing other types of contrast (e.g., topography).
The integrated spectra of TiO2, PbI2, and MAPbI3 are shown in Figure 1a. For SEs emitted with energies <4 eV, the integrated
SE spectra of all three materials are similar, but substantial differences
emerge at energies >4 eV. This effect is also clearly observed
when
comparing the same compound that differs only in particle size, as
illustrated for TiO2. The particle size was determined
using autocorrelation functions as described in Figure S1a,b, and comparisons were made on two different TiO2 films (1 and 2) where the particle size of the TiO2(1) film is smaller than that of the TiO2(2) film (Figure S1a,b). We therefore conclude that structural
effects play a role in the emission of SEs with energies exceeding
4 eV, rendering SEs in this energy range unreliable for chemical mapping.
By contrast, the emission of SEs with energies <4 eV is not affected
by the particle size and, importantly, differences in the volume fraction
do not seem to have a strong influence on the spectrum. We conclude
that SEs at energies <4 eV (are largely SE123,24) result from a direct interaction of the primary electron with the
material and may reflect aspects of the electronic band structure.
For less complex materials such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
(HOPG), a close link with the UPS spectra was determined,39 and we propose that this may also be the case
for MAPbI3. To test this hypothesis, Figure 1b shows the first derivative of the data
presented in Figure 1a. We note the presence of a fine structure in the spectra of both
PbI2 and MAPbI3, with all peak positions listed
in Table 1. The observed
peak positions for MAPbI3 in Figure 1b are in good agreement with those found
in the valence band spectra of MAPbI3 measured using UPS.28 The positions of these peaks are indicated in Figure 1b by the dashed vertical
lines. A direct comparison of the UPS and SE spectra is presented
in Figure S2. We thus conclude that SEs
with energies <4 eV may be used for mapping chemical variations
based on changes in the band structure, and SEHI may be used to select
the most suitable energy window for a specific material.

2.2 Contrast for Organic/Inorganic
Hybrid Perovskite
Materials with Multiple A- and X-Species
Figure 2a shows the integrated SE spectra
of HP1 and HP2 where the lower-energy region of SE spectra are similar,
confirming that the Cs concentration variation does not affect the
SE emission in the low-energy range and hence does not drastically
alter the band structure. It would therefore be difficult to identify
the Cs distribution in the SEHI cross-sectional images in this low-energy
region. Our greatest interest, however, is the mapping of Br because
of its expected influence on device stability and photovoltaic properties.
The SE spectra of Br-doped hybrid perovskite HP3 are plotted in Figure 2b. The low-energy
region (<4 eV) of the SE emission is strongly increased compared
with non-Br-containing perovskites (HP2), and thus, Br-rich regions
appear bright in SEHI images taken with an energy window of 0–3.5
eV. To predict the window of maximum Br contrast and to check that
the contrast does indeed originate from Br variations, we plotted
the predicted contrast curve in Figure 2c. These contrast curves were derived from the SE spectra
in Figure 2b using eq 1 (see Materials and Methods). We observe a high contrast energy
window of 0–4 eV for HP3/HP2, with peaks in contrast of ∼20.0%
at 2.4 eV which is related to the inclusion of Br (see Table 2), whereas the change in the
Cs composition is reflected in the contrast plot for HP2/HP1, yielding
no more than 6% contrast at its peak. Hence, the dominant contrast
relates to the presence of Br when imaging is carried out at the 0–4
eV energy window. To verify that the bright contrast is indeed caused
by Br and not Cs, we present images taken from smaller energy windows
2.1–3.5 and 3.5–5.3 eV. The contrast curve in Figure 2c predicts positive
contrast for both Br- and Cs-rich regions in images taken with the
2.1–3.5 eV window. However, the prediction for images taken
in the 3.5–5.3 eV window is that there is no Cs-related contrast
and a clear contrast reversal is due to Br (e.g., the highest Br concentration
will appear the darkest). The latter is indeed observed (see Figure S4b) and is further evidence that the
contrast stems from Br segregation. Furthermore, we investigate the
contrast in a specimen with 100% Br (no Cs or I) and check for Br
segregation-related contrast with the same method as above (see Figure S4c), in which case we do not observe
any Br segregation but indications of access organic material. This demonstrates the power of hyperspectral imaging, where multiple
images of the same area taken with different SE energy windows can
be used to identify the cause of contrast.

The
differentiated SE spectra of HP1, HP2, and HP3 perovskite materials
are shown in Figure 2d. The peak positions for both HP1 and HP2 in the low-energy region
are at 0.5, 1.3, 2.2, and 3.0 eV and are consistent, albeit having
slightly different peak intensities. The change in the SE intensity
may be due to small variations in the bandgap for the different compositions.
For example, the 1.3 eV peak for HP2 is not well-pronounced; however,
it has an enhanced intensity for HP1. Most notable, however, is the
change in the peak width. The peaks in the SE spectra of the material
with a higher organic content (HP2) are less sharp than those in HP1 (Figure 2d), indicating that
the Cs-doped perovskite system may have a more ordered electronic
structure, in accordance with refs (40) and (41).

Indeed, it was previously reported that an increase
in the Cs content
led to the formation of a sharp absorption onset in FA(1–x)CsxPb(I0.6Br0.4)3 materials, which was taken as an indication
of a more ordered crystalline perovskite material with an increased
Cs content.42 This further points to the
similarities in the characteristics of the SE spectra and optical
absorption spectra because both are influenced by the crystalline
order of the material. Because the optical bandgap is derived from
the onset of the optical absorption spectra, a strong effect of bandgap
on the onset, and hence the low-energy region of the SE spectra, is
to be expected. Given the
well-established change in the electronic band structure as a result
of partially replacing I with Br,43−45 it is not surprising
that the addition of Br in the HP3 perovskite has a pronounced effect
on the shape of the SE spectrum in the low-energy region. The most
intense peak in the spectrum of HP3 is observed at 2.1 eV, whereas
for HP2, it is at 3.2 eV. From these results, we conclude that the
HP2/HP1 contrast curve (Figure 2c) lends itself to hyperspectral imaging of the distribution
of Br, which is the focus of the next section.

2.3 Nanoscale
Mapping of Br in Organic/Inorganic
Hybrid Perovskites
The variation of Br with depth has been
previously postulated.12,46 HIM-SIMS has been reported to
be capable of mapping Br with a nanoscale resolution, but it has not
been attempted to date;37 however, lateral
profiling with HIM-SIMS has revealed significant variation in the
lateral Br concentration over 300 nm range. Here, we demonstrate that
hyperspectral imaging is an ideal technique for Br mapping. As shown
in Figure 3, we compare
standard SE and hyperspectral cross-sectional images (in the energy
range of 0–3.5 eV) of HP3 perovskite materials where the grain
size is 300–500 nm. Figure 3a,b displays standard SE images without (Figure 3a) and with sample tilt (Figure 3b). Figure 3c,d shows the corresponding
hyperspectral images of the HP3 perovskite (in the energy range of
0–3.50 eV). We first compare the contrast in the case of normal
electron beam incidence (no sample tilt). In the standard SE image
(Figure 3a), the contrast
is almost uniform throughout the cross section, whereas in the corresponding
hyperspectral images (Figure 3c), a clear contrast variation between the neighboring grains
is observed (Figure S3). Because of the
choice of the energy window (see Figure 2b,d), we can expect brighter grains in Figure 3c to contain an increased
concentration of Br with respect to other regions and also expect
the magnitude of the Br-related contrast to depend on the position and width of the energy window used to
form the image. That this is indeed the case is shown in Figure S4a,b; hence, the strong contrast between
the grains in Figure 3c is due to the presence of an inhomogeneous distribution of Br.
The contrast principally arises from the difference in the band structure
between Br- and I-based perovskites. The high contrast difference
(∼75.0%) between Br-rich and I-rich grains in Figure 3c is consistent with that observed
as a result of band-off sets in doped regions in semiconductors and
for molecules that are highly diluted within a host self-assembled
monolayer.47−49 The Br concentration variations can be mapped with
a sub-10 nm resolution as determined from the line profile across
two grains, one of which is Br-rich (see Figure S5).

Figure 3 Standard SE and hyperspectral cross-sectional images of the HP3
perovskite: (a) Standard SE image, (b) tilted standard SE image, (c)
hyperspectral image at 0–3.5 eV, and (d) tilted hyperspectral
image at 0–3.5 eV. The scale bars represent 2 μm.

The contrast due to variations
in the electronic structure also
leads to other notable differences between the standard SE image (Figure 3a) and the hyperspectral
image (Figure 3c).
In the standard SE image, an area (indicated by the black arrow) in Figure 3a with weak SE emission
that appears black can be observed and is likely to be interpreted
as a void. The same area in the hyperspectral image contradicts such
a conclusion and identifies this as an area containing excess organic
material. In the standard SE image, the contrast on a flat surface
is dominated by differences in the atomic number (due to the substantial
proportion of SE2). We confirm this further by the images shown in Figure S6, in which the stoichiometry of the
perovskite was varied. Here, changes in the organic content (MAI)
can lead to up to 45% contrast variations in the standard SE image,
while being suppressed in the SEHI. For images formed from low-energy
SEs only, the atomic number contrast is suppressed and the main contrast
mechanism is due to differences in the electronic band structure.

The above conclusions still hold when the sample is tilted, as
shown in Figure 3b,d,
which permits inspection of the fracture surface and allows more accurate
determination of the Br distribution, more specifically whether Br
resides at the grain interior or boundary. We conclude that the fracture
propagation is largely intergranular with occasional transgranular
regions (we refer the reader to Figures S7 and S8 for detailed evidence toward this conclusion). The contrast
in the tilted hyperspectral image (Figure 3d) differs between the two neighboring grains
at the grain boundary (indicated by an arrow) and also within the
grain on the right of the grain boundary. Part of the right grain
appears bright, and hence, we conclude that it is Br-rich but that
the Br concentration decreases (becomes darker across the grain).
The grain to the left of the boundary remains dark and thus is not
Br-rich.

From Figure 3c,d
it can be observed that these bright Br-rich areas are not continuous
throughout the perovskite layer and instead are capped by dark grains
(see Figure S9). This illustrates the value
of studying cross sections rather than top surfaces only that are
insensitive to through-thickness variations in the composition (see Figure S10).

Regions of intergranular fracture
permit the investigation of Br
distribution along the grain boundaries. Figure 4 shows the images of an area in which the
fracture process resulted in the loss of a grain (indicated by the
black arrow), as can be seen by the uneven fracture front and cavity
formation evident in both the standard SE image (Figure 4a) and the hyperspectral image
(Figure 4b) (see Figure S11, which shows Br-rich cavities left
behind). We now compare the contrast between the remaining cavity
walls in Figure 4a,b.
In the hyperspectral image (Figure 4b), the cavity walls are significantly brighter compared
with the surface of the neighboring grain, whereas in the standard
SE image (Figure 4a),
the contrast is almost uniform. We therefore conclude that the cavity
walls and hence these particular grain boundaries are Br-rich, but
we do not find evidence that this is the case for all grain boundaries.
Our experimental results indicate that the Br distribution is not
solely limited to grain boundaries but also varies between and within
grains. Furthermore, the probability of finding Br-rich grains on
the surface is low because of the presence of capping grains, as indicated
in Figure 3c. These
grains are thin (20–40 nm) but easily visible within the hyperspectral
images. The capping layer is specific to this material system, but
the nonuniform Br distribution can also be seen in other Br-based
perovskite systems, for example, MA(1–x)FA(x)PbI(3–y)Br(y) (see Figure S12).

Figure 4 Standard SE and hyperspectral cross-sectional
images of the HP3
perovskite: (a) Standard SE image and (b) hyperspectral image at 0–3.5
eV. The scale bars represent 2 μm.

Local variations in the Br concentration in the organic/inorganic
hybrid perovskites are thus clearly demonstrated using hyperspectral
imaging, and we postulate that these have not previously been observed
using techniques such as SIMS depth profiling because of limitations
to their lateral and vertical nanometer-scale resolutions.37 Furthermore, because of the excellent
sub-10 nm spatial resolution used here, we demonstrate direct evidence
that some of the Br is concentrated at the grain boundaries in a manner
similar to that reported for Cl.46 Because
local inhomogeneities in the Br concentration have been identified
as crucial for further progress of the field,12,37,46 we expect our method to make a significant
contribution to this area.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we present a rigorous validation process for the
origin of image contrast in hyperspectral SE imaging, which is not
limited to organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites. More generally, we
conclude that the separation of SE1 from the SE2 signal will be possible
using hyperspectral imaging. This facilitates investigation of a material
in terms of density-related changes and electronic properties, which
is of great interest in, for example, two-dimensional materials or
nanostructured natural materials (e.g., silk).50−52

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
SE spectra
were collected
for methylammonium iodide (MAI)-, methylammonium bromide (MABr)-,
cesium (Cs)-, and FAI-based hybrid perovskites. The structures investigated
were based on glass/FTO/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 for MAPbI3-based samples and glass/FTO/m-TiO2/Cs(1–x)FA(x)PbI(3–y)Bry (where 0.05 < x <
0.3 and 0.2 < y < 1.0) for Cs/FA mixed halide-based
perovskite samples (supplied by Dyesol UK Ltd.). For MA/FA and mixed
halide-based perovskite samples (supplied by Michael Stringer), the
structure was glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/MA(1–x)FA(x)PbI(3–y)Br(y) (where 0.05 < x < 0.15 and 0.05 < y < 0.15).

4.2 Hyperspectral Imaging
The basic principles
of the experimental method to collect SE spectra have been reported
elsewhere.53 In this work, we used an FEI
Nova NanoSEM 450 scanning electron microscope. All samples were imaged
using a through-lens detector (TLD) at a working distance of 2 mm
with a beam current of 16 pA and an accelerating voltage of 1 kV.
Hyperspectral imaging window selection was performed by varying the
bias to the deflector electrode, and a sequence of SE images was taken
by increasing the deflector voltage (0–10 eV), with a step
size of 0.2 eV. The dwell time was adjusted to 200 ns. We measured
and compared the SE spectra of individual layers and their stack to
identify the spectral window for individual materials. We plotted
SE emission with reference to the applied deflector voltage for individual
materials and calculated the hyperspectral energy window using the
Seiler SE contrast equation. The contrast (C) is
given by eq 1(23) 1  where I1 and I2 represent the SE emission intensity of individual
materials. Complete structures were then imaged using these energy
windows.
