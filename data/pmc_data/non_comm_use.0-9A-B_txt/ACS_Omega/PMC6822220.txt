1,4-Diaryl-
and 1-aryl-4-alkyl-substituted 1,2,4-triazolium salts
are convenient air-stable precursors to carbenes used both as organocatalysts
or as ligands for transition metal complexes. Traditionally, they
are prepared via a multistep synthetic pathway with the low-yielding
formation of the triazolium ring occurring in the last step. We have
developed an alternative two-step synthesis involving the conversion
of a primary amine or aniline derivative to the corresponding 4-substituted
triazole followed by a copper-catalyzed arylation with diaryliodonium
salts. This transition metal-catalyzed arylation can be carried out
under mild conditions in acetonitrile and is tolerant toward both
water and oxygen. Additionally, the high functional group tolerance
of the protocol described here gives easy access to triazolium salts
containing heterocyclic substituents or sulfides.

Introduction
Mostly known as convenient,
air-stable precursors to N-heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs) used in organocatalytic transformations,1−7 1,2,4-triazolium salts also form upon deprotonation of NHC ligands
for transition metal catalysts.7−12 Beyond the field of catalysis, these 1,2,4-triazole-based ligands
form phosphorescent cyclometalated complexes with the substituents
on the carbene ligand being key to their tunable emission wavelengths,13−15 while other late transition metal complexes containing 1,2,4-triazole
ligands have shown promising in vitro anticancer activity in studies
involving breast, colon, lung, skin, liver, and cervical cancer as
well as leukemia.16−20N-Aryl-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles are also frequent
building blocks in organic compounds with biological activity.21−23 Although less common than imidazolium or 1,2,3-triazolium salts,
1,2,4-triazolium salts have been successfully used as ionic liquids
for dissolving cellulose.24

Traditionally,
1-aryl-substituted 1,2,4-triazolium salts are prepared
in three steps via a condensation reaction between an oxadiazolium
intermediate derived from an aryl hydrazine and a primary amine (Scheme 1a).25−28 There are several disadvantages of this synthetic route: First,
the oxadiazolium intermediates are not only highly water-sensitive
and decompose within minutes upon exposure to air but their formation
also requires perchloric acid, thus raising safety concerns regarding
the scaling up of the procedure. Second, many aryl hydrazines are
either not readily available or very expensive. Third, while phenyl
hydrazine proved to be unproblematic and yielded the desired intermediates
nearly quantitatively, we were never able to isolate more than 8%
of the 3-mesityl-1,3,4-oxadiazolium intermediate derived from the
electron-rich mesityl hydrazine. We therefore decided to investigate
alternative routes to 1,4-diaryl- and 1-aryl-4-alkyl-substituted 1,2,4-triazolium
salts. Scheme 1b shows
our approach in which the primary amine RNH2 is first converted
to the 4-R-4H-1,2,4-triazole, followed by a copper-catalyzed
N-arylation using diaryliodonium salts.

Scheme 1 Preparation of 1-Aryl-Substituted
4H-1,2,4-Triazolium
Salts from Primary Amines
The use of diaryliodonium salts is well established for the arylation
of a wide range of oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles both with and
without a copper catalyst.29−31 Chen and co-workers have described
a copper-free route to N-aryl pyridinium species
from diaryliodonium salts and pyridinium N-oxides
or sulfonamidates via a radical rearrangement;32,33 however, the N-arylation of pyridines themselves requires a copper
catalyst.34,35 Most similar to this work describing the
1-arylation of triazoles is a recent report by Kumar et al. investigating
a copper-catalyzed N-arylation of [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridines leading to fused triazolium salts.36 To our knowledge, there have been no examples described
in the literature for the copper-catalyzed 1-arylation of monocyclic
triazoles with diaryliodonium salts; however, the preparation of 4-aryltriazolium
or 3-arylimidazolium salts via similar methods has been reported before.37−47

Results
and Discussion
We were aiming to find the mildest conditions
to carry out the
copper-catalyzed quaternization within short reaction times. To optimize
the copper-catalyzed 1-arylation of 4-R-4H-1,2,4-triazoles,
we initially carried out a series of reactions on a 0.5 mmol scale
with 4-benzyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole (1a)
and diphenyliodonium tetrafluoroborate, which we monitored by LC-MS
(Table 1). We found
that at 100 °C, >95% conversion was achieved in the presence
of all copper(I) and copper(II) catalysts except CuI after 4 h in
DMF and acetonitrile, while reactions in water required prolonged
reaction times (entries 1–13). When lowering the reaction temperature
to 80 °C in acetonitrile, copper(I) proved to be superior to
copper(II): After 4 h, 100% conversion was observed with CuOAc but
only 87 and 88% were found with anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 and
Cu(OAc)2·H2O, respectively (entries 14–16).
Without the addition of a copper catalyst, the conversion dropped
to 17% after 4 h of reaction time (entry 17). When shortening the
reaction time to 1 h, the presence of CuOAc led to 97% conversion,
while anhydrous Cu(OAc)2 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O showed significantly lower conversions (entries 18–20),
thus being consistent with CuOAc being the most efficient catalyst.
Since no unwanted side reactions were observed under these conditions,
we decided to carry out the copper-catalyzed 1-arylation of triazoles
with CuOAc in acetonitrile at 80 °C.

To explore the
scope of the copper-catalyzed N-arylation, we prepared
a variety of 4-R-4H-1,2,4-triazoles 1a–1m from the corresponding primary amines R-NH2 as described in Scheme 1b.48−54Table 2 summarizes
the results of the 1-arylation of 1a–1m with diphenyliodonium tetrafluoroborate using our previously optimized
conditions. Based on NMR studies, 100% conversion was observed with
all 4-R-4H-1,2,4-triazoles 1a–1m, and the corresponding 1-phenyl-4-R-4H-1,2,4-triazolium salts 2a–2m were
obtained as sole products in good to excellent yields (Figures S002–S015). While this was not
surprising with simple alkyl (2a–2c), aryl (2d and2e), or haloaryl substituents
(2g–2k), the copper-catalyzed arylation
of 1f gave 2f cleanly without any arylation
of the para-methoxy-substituted sulfide. Likewise,
although 1l and 1m contain several heteroaryl
nitrogen atoms that could be quaternized, 2l and 2m form preferentially and none of the other possible arylation
products were observed under the chosen reaction conditions despite
the presence of an excess of diaryliodonium tetrafluoroborate. The
isolated yields were generally within 5–10% of the NMR yields.
However, significantly lower isolated yields were obtained with the
heteroaryl-substituted triazolium salts 2l, which was
strongly retained on silica, and 2m, which decomposed
on silica and had to be purified by recrystallization.

Since the
1-aryl substituent governs the electronic properties
of 1,2,4-triazolium salts used for organocatalytic transformations,
a late stage introduction of the aryl group appears to be of general
interest to the organic community. We found that with our N-arylation
method, we were able to introduce a variety of aryl groups in the
last synthetic step, using triazole 1d to investigate
the scope of diaryliodonium salts in the copper-catalyzed quaternization
of triazoles (Table 3). We observed that both the use of diaryliodonium tetrafluoroborates
and triflates resulted in complete conversion to the corresponding
1-aryl-4-phenyltriazolium salts (2d–9d) within 4 h of reaction time. Unhindered electron-rich (e.g., 6d) and electron-poor (e.g., 7d) aryl groups
were introduced with high yields, whereas a decreased isolated yield
was observed for ortho-substituted aryl groups (3d–5d). Although LC-MS indicated complete
conversion, we were unable to isolate 9d.

e Conversion

In
the hope to find a way to isolate 9d, we decided
to investigate the use of unsymmetrical diaryliodonium salts for the
quaternization of triazole 1d (Scheme 2).30 Unfortunately,
with mesityl(perfluorophenyl)iodonium triflate, only traces of the
desired compound 9d were detected, and 5% of the side
product 4d was isolated. The remaining components of
the mixture consisted of unreacted starting materials including the
unreacted mesityl(perfluorophenyl)iodonium triflate. However, when
mesityl(phenyl)iodonium triflate was used instead for the N-arylation,
the more electron-deficient phenyl group was, as expected, transferred
preferentially giving 2d with 95% selectivity.29 Efficient separation of 2d from
the side product 4d was only possible on a small scale
by column chromatography, thus making the use of symmetrical diaryliodonium
salts more desirable for the N-arylation of triazoles (Table 3).

Scheme 2 N-Arylation with
Unsymmetrical Diaryliodonium Triflates
Due to their very low yields via the traditional route (Scheme 1a), we were particularly
interested in applying our N-arylation method to the synthesis of
1-mesityl-substituted 1,2,4-triazolium salts 4a–4l (Table 4). Although
complete conversion was observed for all reactions, the isolated yields
were generally lower than for the corresponding phenyl derivatives
(Table 3) due to more
challenging separation of the desired product from IMes2OTf by column chromatography. Indeed, we did observe increased yields
upon scale-up of the catalytic reactions (e.g., with 4c) as this allowed us to purify the triazolium salts by recrystallization.

The
copper-catalyzed quaternization of 4-R-1,2,4-triazoles 1a–1m provides an efficient route for
systematically varying not only electronic but also steric parameters
of triazolium salts (Table 5). Unsymmetrically substituted electron-rich carbene precursors
(3j and 5b) as well as sterically hindered
electron-poor 1,2,4-triazolium salts (7e and 8e) were readily prepared in high yields. The electron-rich pyrimidine
derivative 6m was found to form cleanly, but its separation
from the remaining diaryliodonium salt provided a challenge since 6m was observed to decompose on silica.

As demonstrated above, our optimized reaction conditions proved
to be ideal from a synthetic perspective for achieving complete N-arylation
of 4-R-1,2,4-tiazoles within short reaction times. Nevertheless, we
were curious how specific reaction parameters such as temperature,
catalyst loading, or stoichiometry of the diaryliodonium salt would
impact the rate and completeness of the N-arylation. In particular,
lowering the reaction temperature might allow the use of triazoles
containing sensitive functional groups. Indeed, further investigation
of the reaction temperature (Figure 1) indicated that although the reaction rate decreases
significantly below 60 °C, prolonged reaction times led to complete
conversion.

Figure 1 Temperature dependence.

Similarly, lowering the catalyst loading from 5 to 1 mol% or 0.5
mol%, resulted in slower but complete product formation within 4 h
with the chosen test substrates (Figure 2). Accordingly, while quaternization was
still observed without the addition of the copper catalyst at 80 °C,
N-arylation occurred at significantly lower rates, and 82% conversion
was obtained after 23 h.

Figure 2 Catalyst loading.

Since all reactions proceeded cleanly to the desired products,
we rationalized that addition of stoichiometric quantities of diaryliodonium
salt should lead to complete product formation. Indeed, when the loading
of diaryliodonium salt was decreased to either 1.25 or 1.1 equivalents,
the reaction still went to completion but required more time (Figure 3). With 1.0 equivalents
of diaryliodonium salt complete conversion was observed after 24 h.

Figure 3 Stoichiometry
of diaryliodonium salt.

Although the reaction
proceeds slowly without a copper catalyst
(Figure 2), we propose
in analogy to the related literature a Cu(I)/Cu(III) mechanism to
be operative in the presence of a copper salt.29,36,55 This is supported by our own findings that
copper(I) proved to be more efficient than the corresponding copper(II)
salt in catalyzing the N-arylation.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated an efficient alternative route
for the preparation of 1-aryl-substituted 4R-4H-1,2,4-triazolium
salts from 4-R-4H-1,2,4-triazoles via a copper-catalyzed
quaternization using diaryliodonium salts. Key features of this pathway
are a uniformly applicable protocol, short reaction times, complete
conversions, and clean product formation.

General
Procedure 2a for the Catalytic Arylation of Triazoles 1a–1m
A 10 mL Schlenk flask equipped with
a stir bar was loaded with the triazole (1 mmol, 1.0 equiv), diaryliodonium
salt (1.5 mmol, 1.5 equiv), and copper(I) acetate (0.05 mmol, 5 mol%),
sealed with a PTFE screwcap, and filled with argon. Dry acetonitrile
(4 mL) was added under a stream of argon, and the flask was resealed,
then placed into an oil bath, and stirred for 4 h at 80 °C. After
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the solvent was
evaporated. NMR yields and conversion were determined by addition
of mesitylene (1 mmol, 1 equiv) in DMSO-d6 to the crude reaction mixture. The pure triazolium salts were obtained
either by recrystallization or column chromatography (dichloromethane/acetone,
4:1) as described below.

General
Procedure 2b for the Catalytic Arylation of Triazoles 1a–1m
A 5 mL microwave tube equipped with
a stir bar was loaded inside a glovebox with the triazole (0.5 mmol,
1.0 equiv) and the diaryliodonium salt (0.75 mmol, 1.5 equiv). After
sealing the microwave tube and removing it from the glovebox, the
catalyst (copper(I) acetate (0.025 mmol, 0.05 equiv, 5 mol%) in 2
mL of acetonitrile) was added via syringe to the reaction mixture.
The reaction mixture was then stirred for 4 h in an oil bath at 80
°C, cooled to room temperature, and concentrated. NMR yields
and conversion were determined by addition of mesitylene (0.5 mmol,
1 equiv) in DMSO-d6 to the crude reaction
mixture. The pure triazolium salts were obtained either by recrystallization
or column chromatography (dichloromethane/acetone, 4:1) as described
below.
