This paper proposes a new method
of using two NIR digital cameras
to measure water turbidity accurately and quickly. A measuring device
based on an NIR camera and image processing software is designed.
Two NIR cameras collect scattered and transmitted images when the
NIR light is passing through the turbid solution. The average RGB
values of 400 pixels in the central region of the image are obtained
and converted into CIE Lab color space values. The water turbidity
was measured by the functional relationship between turbidity and
the corresponding color components (R, G, B, L, a, b, and grayscale). The results of comparison with a commercial
turbidimeter show that this method has a high accuracy for the determination
of standard solution with wider linear range and is consistent with
the turbidimeter results for the measurement of real samples, which
verifies the feasibility of this method.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water contains suspended
and colloidal substances such as soil,
dust, microorganisms, and zooplankton, which can make the water turbid.
Turbidity refers to a solution’s degree of obstruction to light,
which includes the scattering of light by suspended matter and the
absorption of light by solute molecules.1 Turbidity is not only related to particulate matter in water but
also to the particles’ size, shape, and surface area.2 Liquid turbidity measurement has a wide range
of applications in water supply, brewing, pharmaceutical preparation,
environmental protection, health and epidemic prevention, and many
other industries.3 In water quality monitoring,
turbidity is also an important parameter to characterize water quality,
and turbidity measurement plays an important role in the turbidity
control systems for industrial and drinking water.4

Some turbidity measurement techniques are based on
optical methods,
including the visual turbidity, transmission light, scattering light,
and ratio methods.5−7 A visual turbidimeter has poor accuracy and is only
suitable for rough judgment of water turbidity.8 The transmission light, scattering light, and ratio methods
that were based on the photoelectric detection have been developed
and were utilized to measure the turbidity.9 The main difference among them is the different angles of photodetectors
relative to incident light and the different number of photodetectors.
The angle of the detector has a great influence on the measurement
range and sensitivity of turbidity detection.10 As for the transmission light method, the angle between the photodetector
and incident light is 180°. When the path length is determined,
multiple light scattering events will occur among particles in high
turbidity solution (>250 NTU), and the linear relationship between
scattering light intensity and suspended particle concentration will
be disturbed.11 Therefore, the transmission
light method is always used to measure those high turbidity solutions,
whereas the scattering method is suitable for the low turbidity measurements.12 In the ratio method, two detectors are utilized
simultaneously. One detector for incident light, positioned at 90°,
is used to measure the intensity of scattered light, and another detector,
at 180°, is used to measure the intensity of transmitted light.
Because the transmission and scattering light have the same transmission
medium, the influence of the change of water color and light source
on turbidity is the same, so this method can remove part of the interference
and improve the sensitivity. However, the ratio of scattered light
to transmitted light intensity is not strictly linear, although it
is approximately linear within a certain range of turbidity, so the
measurement range of turbidity has certain limitations.13

Apart from the conventional turbidity
detection methods as mentioned
above, some new turbidity measurement methods have been developed,
such as using the attenuation of signal intensity as a turbidity measurement
when measuring depth with a lidar pulse signal.14 It is able to measure the turbidity within the range of
0–1000 NTU with improved accuracy and robustness compared to
the existing turbidity sensors.15 Another
type of detector, using a plastic fiber sensor, has also been studied.
This type of detector uses multimode optical fibers, and the probe
is immersed in the turbid solution to collect reflection signals and
determine turbidity by using different reflection signals.16 In addition, there is a measurement method based
on chromaticity coordinates based on transmission spectroscopy, which
uses different absorbance of different turbid solutions to express
the turbidity of solutions by chromaticity coordinates.17

The above turbidity measurement methods
are all based on the photoelectric
detection technique. For them, it is necessary to design the optical
path, photoelectric detection circuit, signal amplification and processing
circuit, and A/D conversion circuit. Hence, the whole system is complicated
and the cost is expensive.18,19 Additionally, a smartphone
camera with the HydroColor was applied to measure the remote sensing
reflectance and turbidity.20

In this
study, a simple device with low cost was designed to measure
the turbidity. Two NIR cameras were used to obtain the transmitted
and scattered light images of NIR light passing through a turbid solution,
and the RGB values of images were obtained by image processing. Then,
the CIE Lab and the grayscale values of the solution image are obtained
by RGB values. Luminance refers to the brightness of a surface, expressed
in L, that is, the light flux reflected from a surface.
The intensity of light can be measured by the total amount of light
illuminated on the plane, which is called incident light. If the intensity
of light is measured by the amount of light reflected from the plane
to the eyeball, then it is called reflection light or brightness.
Under the same conditions, the greater the intensity of light, the
brighter it will be. Among some color spaces, the CIE Lab is the most
intuitive color space to express brightness. Moreover, it is found
that the luminance (L) has a linear relationship
with turbidity when the RGB color space is converted into Lab color
space in our experiments. The variation trends of RGB, Lab, and grayscale
values with a series of turbid solutions and modes of transmission,
scattering, and ratio are analyzed and fitted, and the expressions
of RGB, Lab, and grayscale values for turbidity are obtained. The
real samples were measured and compared with turbidimeter data to
verify the feasibility of this method for turbidity measurement.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Experimental Data and Analysis
To
test the performance of our device, some standard solutions with different
turbidity values were prepared according to the international standard
ISO7027. First, the distilled water was filtered at least twice by
a microporous membrane with a pore size of 0.2 μm. Then, the
filtrate was obtained as the zero turbidity water (means 0 NTU without
sample). The other standard solutions with different turbidity values,
such as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250,
300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950,
and 1000 NTU were prepared, referring to the ISO 7027 using the zero
turbidity water, hydrazine sulfate, and hexamethylenetetramine.

The RGB values of transmitted and scattered light corresponding to
different turbidities were measured and then converted to Lab and
grayscale values, respectively. Note that each standard solution was
measured five times to reduce the error. The standard deviation for
each measurement was calculated using eq 1 as shown below 1  where
the α is the standard
deviation, Vi is the measurement values, V0 is the averaged value, and n is measurement amount. However, the calculated standard deviation
values are rather small (∼0.5) in comparison to the measured
values. Hence, the standard deviation was not considered. The averaged
value, which was calculated by the five measurements, was regarded
as the experimental data in this study.

Figure 1 shows that
the variation trend of G and R values
is consistent with that of turbidity in the scattering and transmission
modes. However, the B value in the scattering mode
does not correspond to turbidity one to one, whereas the B value in the transmission mode is almost the same and hardly distinguished
at a low concentration range. Hence, the B value
is not suitable for the turbidity measurement under the current condition.
One reason for this is the different spectral sensitivity of the red,
green, and blue channels.20 The blue and
the green channels have cross interference. Moreover, the blue channel
has high sensitivity. Another reason is that the camera’s white
balance setting affects the gain of the three-color channels.

between turbidity and RGB values. (a) Relationship
in scattering mode. (b) Relationship in transmission mode.

Figure 2 shows
the
good corresponding relationship between the L value
and turbidity, which means that the L value can be
used to measure turbidity, while the values of a or b are not suitable for turbidity measurement because of
the nonmonotonicity between turbidity and a or b. According to the Beer–Lambert law, as shown in eq 2 2  where IT is the intensity of transmitted light, I0 is the intensity of incident light, k is the proportional constant, d is the
turbidity
of the sample solution, and l is path length; there
is a negative exponential relationship between transmitted light intensity
and turbidity. However, the relationship between luminance L and turbidity is approximately linear when the transmitted
light is measured in this research. The reason is that the luminance L obtained by the imaging method is different from the light
intensity obtained by the photocell of the turbidimeter.

Figure 2 Relationship
between turbidity and Lab values. (a) Relationship
in scattering mode. (b) Relationship in transmission mode.

By using the ratio between scattering and transmission data,
the
influence of light refraction, the color of turbid solution, aging,
and instability of the LED light source on measurement can be eliminated.
The ratios of R, G, and B are denoted as R′, G′, and B′. As shown in Figure 3, the R′, G′, and B′ values in the
transmission/scattering mode have high sensitivity for low concentrations,
whereas they become very low for the medium and high concentrations.
The sensitivity of RGB in scattering/transmission mode is high for
high concentration and low for medium and low concentrations.

(b) Relationship in the ratio of transmission to scattering mode.

The ratios of L, a, and b are denoted by L′, a′, and b′, as shown in Figure 4. In this ratio mode,
the effect based on
the L′ value is the best. Using either the
ratio of scattering to transmission or transmission to scattering
mode, the L′ value has higher discrimination
of changes in turbidity. However, the color components a′ and b′ are indistinguishable at
the medium turbidity range and cannot be used for turbidity measurement.

2.2 Fitting Results of R, G, L, and Grayscale
Values to Turbidity
Through the analysis of experimental
data, the trend of change
between the R value, G value, L value, and turbidity shows good monotonicity, so R, G, and L values in
the scattering, transmission, and ratio measurement modes are selected
for turbidity measurement. The formulas of fitting curves and coefficient
of determination are given in Figure 5. The fitted coefficients R2 are very close to 1, which means that the fitted formulas have a
good fit with those curves. Using these fitted formulas, the turbidity
of the solution can be calculated.

transmission, and the ratio

value in the ratio of transmission to scattering mode (Tran/Scat-G′), and (h) fitting curve of L′
value in the ratio of transmission to scattering mode (Tran/Scat-L′).

The grayscale of image
also represents the turbidity of solution.
It can be calculated using eq 3 3  where R, G, and B means the RGB values of the turbid
solution images. These grayscale values in scattering and transmission
modes are also fitted, as shown in Figure 6.

2.3 Measurement of Standard Turbidity
To verify
the performance of the turbidity measurement of our device,
the turbidity of standard solutions and real samples were measured
using the designed device and two commercial turbidimeters, namely,
Turb-1 with the range of 0–200 NTU and Turb-2 with the range
of 0–1000 NTU. The standard turbid solutions of 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, and 200 NTU were measured by our setup,
and compared with Turb-1, the standard turbid solutions of 50, 100,
200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 NTU were measured and compared
with Turb-2. All of the turbidity data and standard turbidity value
were analyzed by the independent sample t test. The
detailed results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. As shown in the two
tables, no matter the results of the one-sided test or the results
of the two-sided test, the significance level are much greater than
0.05 in each set, indicating that there was no significant difference
in data. These results show that the performance of our setup is comparable
to that of commercial products.

The measurement
accuracy was estimated by calculation of the deviation
rate using eq 4 as shown
below 4  where D̅ is the deviation rate, Vi is the measurement
values using the designed device and two commercial turbidimeters, V0 is the corresponding standard turbidity values,
and n is measurement amount using the same method.
The less D̅ value means the higher measurement
accuracy.

Moreover, the accuracy was also calculated to estimate
measurement
accuracy using eq 5 5  where A is
the accuracy level, max means the maximum values that are measured,
and R is the measurement range of the instruments.
The less A value means the higher measurement accuracy.

All the calculated deviation rates and accuracy levels are listed
in Tables 1 and 2. As shown in Table 1, the deviation rates under the Scat-R, Scat-L, Scat/Tran-L′,
Tran/Scat-G′, Tran/Scat-L′, and Scat-gray measurement modes are lower than those of
the value measured by Turb-1, whereas the other deviation rates are
higher than those of Turb-1. Additionally, the Scat-R, Scat-L, Tran-L, Scat/Tran-L′, Tran/Scat-G′, Tran/Scat-L′, Scat-gray, and Tran-gray modes are more accurate
due to their less A values. However, all the deviation
rates and accuracy levels measured by Turb-2 are higher than those
of the values measured by our designed setup, which means that our
methods are more accurate for the measurement of high turbidity solutions.
To get a trade-off between low turbidity solution measurement and
high turbidity solution measurement, eight measurement modes, that
is, Scat-R, Scat-L, Tran-L, Scat/Tran-L′, Tran/Scat-G′, Tran/Scat-L′, Scat-gray,
and Tran-gray, were selected for turbidity measurement.

2.4 Contrastive Measurement of Real Samples
Ten sample
solutions were obtained from local rivers, industrial
wastewater, and production water, and the other 10 sample solutions
were randomly prepared with standard turbid water. These 20 sample
solutions were used as the current study’s real samples. The
data of 20 real samples measured by Turb-1, Turb-2, and our chosen
eight measurement models were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (analysis
of variance). Their Pearson correlation coefficient γ were also
calculated. When the significance level α is 0.05, the critical
value Fcrit (1, 38) is 4.0982.

The
analysis results of real samples are shown in Table 3. The probability P-values
of the eight groups of data are all greater than α, whereas
all F values are less than Fcrit. The Pearson correlation coefficients are very close to
1. These results indicate that there is no significant difference
between the data of eight measurement modes and the Turb-1 and Turb-2
data. It also shows the practicability and consistency of measurement
results using the new NIR digital camera device.

3 Conclusions
A turbidity measurement method based on
the NIR camera is proposed.
The turbidity measurement device and image acquisition software were
designed. The transmission and scattering images of NIR light through
solutions with different turbidity were obtained with the camera and
used to obtain the fitting relations and correlation of turbidity
values under transmission, scattering, and ratio modes for different
color components. Data analysis verifies the feasibility of eight
turbidity measurement methods: luminance L and color R in scattering mode, luminance L in transmission
mode, color G in transmission/scattering mode, luminance L in ratio (scattering/transmission and transmission/scattering)
mode, and grayscale in scattering and transmission mode. Compared
with two standard turbidimeters, our device and proposed methods have
higher accuracy in the measurement of standard solutions. For the
measurement of specific water samples, our experimental results are
consistent with those of the standard turbidimeters, which verify
the practicability of our methods. Using the NIR camera instead of
an optical detection system not only reduces the cost of the design
but also improves the accuracy of the measurement. The method can
also be applied to other NIR measurement fields.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Measuring Device
Figure 7 shows the schematic diagram
of the designed device. The system consists of an NIR light source,
a sample cell, two NIR cameras, and a microcomputer. The NIR light
source uses an 850 nm, 0.5 W LED, powered by the USB port from the
camera, and driven by an adjustable current source circuit. The working
current is about 15 mA. As reported by Omar and Matjafri, the NIR
light source is less influenced by the color of the solution.21 Therefore, NIR light sources with a wavelength
at 850 nm was used in this study. When the LED works in constant current,
the current flowing through the LED can be kept within the rated working
range to ensure the stability of the light source. One camera for
the transmission mode is in line with the NIR light source (180°),
and the other for the scattering mode is perpendicular to the NIR
light source (90°). A black PVC tube is used to connect the camera
and the sample compartment, and the inner diameter of this PVC pipe
is 30 mm. The camera is connected to the microcomputer through a USB
port. The acquired image is sent to the computer for further processing
to obtain the required experimental data. The black cover and sample
chamber form a closed space, which effectively avoids the interference
of other light sources on the turbidity measurement.

Figure 7 Schematic diagram of
the experimental device.

4.2 The Function
of the NIR Digital Camera
Two NIR cameras with the same type
were used in the experiment. Both
of them are 850 nm narrow-band filters combined with ordinary CMOS
cameras. The CMOS sensor model is AR0130. The maximum resolution is
1280 × 960. The 850 nm narrow-band filter with a focal length
of 3.6 mm can effectively eliminate the influence of other wavelengths
and improve the sensitivity. To verify the experimental results, the
camera can be manually adjusted in focus, white balance, tone, and
other parameters.

The CMOS photosensitive elements used in digital
cameras are semiconductor devices used to record the change of light.
Each pixel of the camera is equivalent to a photoelectric detection
element. After the light passes through the turbid solution and the
850 nm filter, in turn, the camera collects the incident light with
a wavelength of about 850 nm. The camera’s photodiode detects
the intensity of NIR light sensitively. The CMOS image sensor converts
an optical image into an electrical signal, which is converted into
a digital image signal after A/D (analog-to-digital conversion). Then,
it is sent to the digital signal processing (DSP) chip for processing
into raw RGB data and transmitted to the computer through the USB
interface. For RGB cameras, the NIR light is equivalent to a white
light source, and the result of camera imaging is a gray image.22 Therefore, the camera can take a clear NIR image
and express it in RGB. In addition, using the camera can avoid the
necessity of developing a photoelectric detection, signal processing,
and A/D conversion circuit to allow visualization of the turbidity
measurement process.

4.3 Design of Image Acquisition
Software
The image acquisition software interface is shown
in Figure 8. Using
the Visual Studio platform,
it was developed with C# language and Camera_NET control, and the
programming was relatively simple. “Camera selection”
is used to select the experimental camera, and “camera settings”
includes options to adjust the brightness, white balance, tone, saturation,
and exposure settings of the camera. The software automatically saves
the parameters of the previous camera settings. However, due to the
different requirements of transmission and scattering for camera parameters,
transmission and scattering need a set of fixed camera parameters.
“Snapshot the frame” obtains a frame image and takes
the average RGB value of 400 pixels in the central region of the frame
image. In this way, the RGB value corresponding to the turbid solution
can be obtained, and then, the corresponding Lab value of the turbid
solution can be obtained by converting the RGB color space to the
CIE Lab color space. In the CIE Lab color space, “L” represents the luminance of the solution through light,
“a” represents the range from red to
green, and “b” represents the range
from yellow to blue. L ranges from 0 to 100, and a and b range from +127 to −128.

Figure 8 Screenshot
of the software interface.

An approximate conversion algorithm is used to transform the RGB
color space to the CIE Lab color space as follows.23 First, the RGB color space is converted to the XYZ color
space 6   7  

Then, the XYZ color space is converted to CIE Lab color space 8   9
