[Pb2(bdc)1.5(aiz)]n (1) and [Pb2(bdc)1.5(aiz)(MeOH)2]n (2) (H2bdc = 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic
acid, aiz = (E)-N′-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)isonicotinohydrazide)
have been synthesized, and structural characterization has been established
by X-ray analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Here, bdc2– links two Pb(II) centers and the aiz ligand binds
the metal centers in two different manners: chelating and monodonating.
Thus, polymerizations have taken place from the combination of mixed
ligand system. Optical band gaps have been studied via UV measurements.
Again, the experimental and calculated (from density functional theory
(DFT)) band gaps agree well and the semiconducting properties of synthesized
polymeric materials have been approved. Thus, optoelectronic and photonic
devices can be made by this type of coordination polymers (CPs). The I–V representative curves of 1 (device-A) and 2 (device-B) in both dark and
illuminated conditions show that device-A has a higher magnitude of
current than device-B. Dark- and photo-conductivity values of device-A
are calculated as 2.94 × 10–6 and 6.12 ×
10–6 S m–1, respectively, whereas
for device-B, the values of dark- and photo-conductivity are 2.92
× 10–7 and 3.66 × 10–7 S m–1, respectively, at room temperature.

==== Body
Introduction:
Lead(II), a heavy toxic metal, is affecting almost every organ
in the body.1 Still, lead is used worldwide
because of its application in energy storage devices for their reliability
and cost-efficiency such as lead-acid batteries and lead-carbon batteries2 along with lithium-ion battery.3,4 The coordination chemistry of lead is not so popular unlike transition
metals as Pb(II), d10, neither is magnetically active nor synthesizes
colorful complexes. However, the group 14 Pb(II) has a large radius
and has also flexible stereochemical activity with distinctive coordination
preferences, which provide unique opportunities to construct an interesting
network.5 Besides, Pb-halide perovskites
APbBr3 are potential photoactive materials and have shown
promise for low-cost photoconducting and solar energy conversion materials.6 This has prompted us to design Pb(II)-based metal–organic
coordination polymers (MOCPs).7 Emerging
trends of chemistry have been continuously flagging due to the synthetic
compounds and their applications. The metal–organic framework
(MOF)8−18 is one of the potential materials in this direction. The metal–organic
coordination polymeric compounds are also useful to construct photonic
and optoelectronic devices.19−22 Semiconducting materials made by polymeric organic
compounds have been used over the last few years, but the insufficient
thermal stability lagged them behind. Overall electronic properties23−28 of these types of materials may be tuned by the thoughtful selection
of organic ligand entities. High thermochemical stability of the coordination
polymer arises due to the presence of a strong covalent bond, which
is generated by the self-assembly (via secondary interactions)29−32 process. Nonmetallic materials can also be used as semiconductor
materials,24 but sometimes these compounds
are lagging behind due to the complicated synthetic procedure, nonreproducibility,
and thermal and chemical instability. In the case of metal-introduced
hybrid materials, these problems can be overcome.19−22 The highly ordered molecules
in the coordination polymers produce unitary cell-like arrangements.33 Different secondary interactions assemble the
motifs to form a large surface area to collect photons in illumination
conditions, which causes transfer of excited electrons from highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO).34,35 The photoconductivity over the polymeric
molecule–electrode interface occurs via excitation of charge
carriers and migration over the lattice followed by charge separation.
In this aspect, we are able to design two Pb(II)-based coordination
polymers36−41 and are useful to fabricate optoelectronic devices.

In the
present work, two Pb(II)-based coordination polymeric compounds
[Pb2(bdc)1.5(aiz)]n (1) and [Pb2(bdc)1.5(aiz)(MeOH)2]n (2) have been
synthesized (Scheme 1), and electrical conductivity has been studied. A higher magnitude
of current is observed in the I–V characteristic curves for 1 than 2, in
both dark and irradiated conditions. Dark- and photo-conductivity
values of 1 are calculated as 2.94 × 10–6 and 6.12 × 10–6 S m–1,
respectively, whereas for 2, the values of dark- and
photo-conductivity are 2.92 × 10–7 and 3.66
× 10–7 S m–1, respectively.
Thus, these compounds may be possible options for optoelectronic device
fabrication.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Compound 1 and 2 upon the
Reaction of Pb(NO3)2 with Aiz and H2bdc Ligands
Result and Discussion
Crystal
Structures
The confirmatory molecular arrangements
of 1 and 2 are obtained by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The asymmetric unit in 1 contains
two metal centers (Pb01 and Pb02), and they are in the distorted pentagonal
geometry with a PbO4N coordination sphere. In Pb01, the
center metal ion binds through bdc2– in two different
manners, chelating (by two O-atoms from a carboxylic acid group) and
bridging (by two O-atoms, one is μ1-O and another
is μ2-O, from two different carboxylic acid groups),
and resulted in polymerization. Again, there is a monodonation of
pyridyl-N atom from the “aiz” ligand. Thus, every Pb(II)
center is coordinated with three bdc2– and one aiz
ligands. The Pb–O and Pb–N bond lengths (Pb01–O004,
2.435(10); Pb01–O2, 2.943(10); Pb01–O005_d, 2.763(9);
Pb01–O006, 2.285(10); and Pb01–N00A_c, 2.533(12) Å)
also confirm the distorted nature of the geometry (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) View of the repeating
dimeric unit of 1, (b) one-dimensional
(1D) ribbon-like polymeric arrangement of the molecule along the “b” axis, and (c) two-dimensional (2D) square-grid
net of 1 viewed along the “a”
axis.

The similar PbO4N geometrical
atmosphere also appears
around the Pb02 center. In this case, the central metal ion is chelated
from both the ligands: dicarboxylic acid and aiz along with bridging-O
of the second bdc2– unit. The Pb02–O and
Pb02–N bond lengths are Pb02–O1, 2.322(10); Pb02–O2_a,
2.651(10); Pb02–O3, 2.392(12); Pb02–O005, 2.890(9);
and Pb02–N1, 2.447(15) Å (Figure 1a). Due to presence of two types of Pb(II)
centers and two kinds of bridging units (bdc2– and
aiz), 1 adopts a 1D ribbon-like polymeric structure (Figure 1b), and the 2D square-grid
arrangement is achieved by the chelating and monodonating nature of
aiz with Pb(II) (Figure 1c). During the formation of structural architecture, there are a
few prominent supramolecular hydrogen-bonding (intramolecular: N2–H2A···S1
= 2.07 Å (∠N2–H2A···S1
= 143°), C3–H3···O2 = 2.59 Å (∠C3–H3···O2 = 131°), and
C00S–H00S···O004 = 2.42 Å (∠C00S–H00S···O004 = 127°) along with intermolecular:
C4–H4···O1 = 2.56 Å (∠C4–H4···O1 = 159°) and C00X–H00X···O005
= 2.51 Å (∠C00X–H00X···O005
= 134°)) interactions, which play a crucial role in maintaining
the molecular structure. As a result, 1 produces a three-dimensional
(3D) structure assisted from π···π interactions
(Figure 2). The asymmetric
unit of 2 also holds two metal centers (Pb1 and Pb2)
of hexa-coordinated geometry with a PbO5N coordination
sphere. In the Pb1 center, the metal ion binds in a chelating manner
by two different bdc2– units along with bridging-O
(μ2-O) with another bdc2– unit
and monodonation of the pyridyl-N atom from the aiz ligand and satisfies
the hexa-coordinating (Pb1–O3d, 2.638(9); Pb1–O4c, 2.500(7);
Pb1–O5c, 2.526(7); Pb1–O6, 2.532(8); Pb1–O7,
2.711(8); and Pb1–N4, 2.449(9) Å) geometrical arrangement
(Figure 3a).

π···π interactions in 2 (along

molecule (along the a-axis).

But in the Pb2 environment, two solvent molecules (MeOH) are coordinated
with the metal center and it is also chelated by aiz and bdc2– ligands (Pb2–O1, 2.301(8); Pb2–O2, 2.414(7); Pb2–O3,
2.795(8); Pb2–O9, 2.788(12); Pb2–O10b, 2.808(9); Pb2–N2,
2.425(9) Å). Again, the monomeric unit undergoes polymerization
from dicarboxylic acid along with aiz and is supported from the π···π
supramolecular interaction (Figure 3b) to form 2D arrangements (Figure 3c).

The hydrogen bonding, intermolecular
(O(9)–H(9)···O(4)
= 1.97 Å (∠O(9)–H(9)···O(4)
= 168°) and C(26)–H(26B)···O(6) = 2.50
Å (∠C(26)–H(26B)···O(6)
= 164°)) and intramolecular (C(3)–H(3)···O(3)
= 2.50 Å, ∠C(3)–H(3)···O(3)133),
is responsible for the formation of assembly of the molecules and
constructs a 3D supramolecular structure (Figure 4).

tetragonal
grid. (b) 3D supramolecular interdigitated structure of molecular
arrangement.

Thermal Stability of 1 and 2
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA,
30–700 °C) revealed
that 1 is more stable (150 °C) than 2 (120 °C) (Figure S1) and the loss
in weight may be due to the release of coordinated solvent molecules.
Finally, the network breaks after 225 °C for 1 and
270 °C for 2. To verify the phase purity of 1 and 2, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
test was also undertaken (Figures S2 and S3).

DFT Computation
The experimental UV–vis spectra
of 1 and 2 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
have sharp absorption at ∼323 and 360 nm, respectively. The
time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation in the
triplet spin state (using the DMSO solvent and conductor-like polarizable
continuum model (CPCM) model) was performed to investigate the cause
of UV–vis transitions in 1 and 2.
The TD-DFT-calculated energies of the specific bands along with the
nature of transitions, theoretical lambdas, and oscillation strengths
(f) are listed in Table S1. Some molecular orbital diagrams with energy are also listed (Tables S2–S5). The λ (calcd) values
for 1 and 2 are 327.72 and 360.09 nm, respectively,
and these may be interligand charge transfer transitions (ILCTs) and
the experimental wavelengths are 323 and 362 nm correspondingly. For
compound 1, the transition from HOMO → LUMO +
1 (β) has contributions mainly due to the absorption bands at
323 nm. However, 2 shows the absorption peaks at 362
nm, and this may be due to the HOMO – 1 → LUMO + 1 (α)
transition. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO, ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO (eV), is also obtained from DFT computation in the
triplet state (Figure 5), and it is correlated with the obtained band gap (normally considered
as the difference between conduction and valence bands) from Tauc’s
plot by the UV spectrum. Minor discrepancy between experimental and
calculated band gaps is obtained in the triplet than in the singlet
spin state (Figure S4). The band gaps (Tauc’s
plot) of the synthesized 1 and 2 were estimated
as 3.46 and 3.01 eV, respectively, while band gaps from DFT computation
are 2.84 and 2.52 eV (β spin), respectively.

Figure 5 Energy difference between
HOMO and LUMO of 1 and 2 in the triplet
state (DFT).

Optical Characterization
The optical characterization
was studied (λ, 300–600 nm). Figure 6 (inset) exhibits normalized optical absorbance
spectra of 1 and 2. The optical band gap
of the compounds resembles the excitation of an electron to the conduction
band from the valance band (obtained using Tauc’s equation).42,43 1  where α is the absorption coefficient; Eg is the band gap energy, h is Planck’s
constant, ν is the frequency of light, n is
the electron transition process-dependent constant
(in direct transition, n = 1/2), and A is the constant, which is considered as 1 for the common
case.44,45 The (αhν)2 vs hν plot of compounds under investigation
is shown in Figure 6. In the (αhν)2 vs hν plot, the linear region of both the plots is extrapolated
and the direct optical band gap energies of 1 and 2 are calculated as 3.46 and 3.01 eV, respectively.

Electrical Characterization
Figure 7 shows I–V characteristics of device-A (Al/1/ITO) and
device-B (Al/2/ITO) under dark and illuminated conditions,
and it shows that device-A has a higher magnitude of current than
device-B. At room temperature (RT), dark- and photo-conductivity values
of device-A are calculated as 2.94 × 10–6 and
6.12 × 10–6 S m–1, respectively,
whereas for device-B, the values of dark- and photo-conductivity are
2.92 × 10–7 and 3.66 × 10–7 S m–1, respectively. The inset of Figure 7 shows the logarithmic presentation
of current as a function of voltage.

and (b) device-B under dark and illumination conditions.

For better understanding of the charge transport mechanism
in devices,
the thermionic emission (TE) theory is used,46 and according to this theory, the current of a diode may be stated
as follows, eqs 2–447 2  where 3   4  where I0 is the
saturation current, q is the electronic charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature
in kelvin, V is the forward bias voltage, η
is the ideality factor, ϕB is the effective barrier
height at zero bias, A is the diode area (7.065 ×
10–6 m2), and A* is
the effective Richardson constant (1.20 × 106 A m–2 K–2). According to Cheung, the
forward bias I–V characteristics
(in terms of series resistance) may be stated as48eq 5 and the
series resistance is calculated49 from eqs 6–8 5  where IRS indicates
the voltage drop across the series resistance of the device. 6   7  and H(J)
can be stated as 8  From the dV/dln(J) vs J plot, the series resistance, RS, and ideality factor, η, for all of the devices
in dark- and photo-conditions are determined by the slope and intercept,
respectively (Figure 8). Using the y-axis intercept of the H(J) vs J curve, the potential barrier height (ϕb) for the devices is calculated, and the slope of this plot
provides a second determination of the series resistance. Obtained RS, η, and ϕb are listed
in Table 1.

Schottky barrier diodes in dark- and photo-condition.

light	3.66 × 10–7	0.97	3.64 × 105	0.78	3.44 × 105	
The value of η
in dark conditions deviates from ideal behavior,
and the difference may arise for the presence of inhomogeneities of
the Schottky barrier height, hole recombination in the depletion region,
series resistance, and existence of interface states.50,51 The ideality factor, η, value moves toward unity upon illumination
of light. After absorbing light, the series resistance, RS, of the compounds in both cases decreases and signifies
its applicability in the field of optoelectronic devices.

By
using the power law (I ∞ Vm), the current conduction mechanism is described,52 where m refers to the slope
of the I vs V curve. The current–voltage
plot (Figure 9) exhibits
two different regions under forward bias. At low bias voltage, region-I,
the sample exhibits an Ohmic nature, i.e., the current is directly
proportional to the applied bias voltage (I ∞ V). The region II corroborates the variation of current
with square of forward bias voltage (I ∞ V2), and in this region the conduction mechanism
is explained by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mechanism
dominated by the discrete trapping level.53,54

Figure 9 Logarithmic
plots of the I–V characteristic
curves in dark and light conditions: (a) device-A
and (b) device-B.

The injected carriers
spread and make a space charge field when
it is more than that of background carriers, and the currents are
controlled by the field and known as SCLC.55 The performance of the device greatly depends on the mobility and
transit time of carriers. Thus, from the I vs V2 plot, the mobility has been evaluated (Figure 9) taking the Mott–Gurney
space-charge-limited current (SCLC)56,57 (eq 9) 9  where I is the current, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, μeff is
the effective mobility of electron, d is the thickness,
and εr is the dielectric constant. The dielectric
constant (εr) of the material is derived by the capacitance
vs frequency plot (C–F) (Figure 10) taking58 (eq 10) 10  The values of mobility for 1 and 2 are
8.31 × 10–7 and 2.25 × 10–7 m2 V–1 s–1 under
dark conditions and 1.43 × 10–5 and
2.57 × 10–6 m2 V–1 s–1 under photo conditions, respectively. This
has been admirable compared to some other materials of this type.
Some examples of semiconducting materials and their corresponding
photosensitivities are listed in Table S6.

Figure 10 Capacitance versus frequency plot (a) for 1 and (b)
for 2.

The transit time, τ,
is the time required by a carrier to
travel to the cathode from anode, and it may be stated as a summation
of the average time spent by each electron (as a free carrier) plus
the total time spent in the trap.59 The
transit time of the charge carrier is calculated using eq 11(60) 11  In dark conditions, the effective mobility
values of the carriers are estimated as 8.31 × 10–7 and 2.25 × 10–7 m2 V–1 s–1 for 1 and 2, respectively.
Effective carrier mobility (μeff) values, after irradiation
of light, improve to 1.43 × 10–5 (1) and 2.57 × 10–6 m2 V–1 s–1 (2), respectively. In dark conditions,
the transit time (τ) is longer, which leads to higher trapping
probabilities, but the situation is reverse after illumination of
light, which may be due to the higher carrier mobility.59 The values of μeff and τ
of 1 and 2 are presented in Table 2.

Impedance Spectroscopic
Measurement
The impedance spectroscopic
study is carried out within the frequency range 40 Hz to 10 MHz taking
the oscillating voltage of 200 mV by an Agilent 4294A LCR meter at
room temperature. Nyquist plots for two compounds 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 11. The higher-frequency semicircular arc represents
the bulk contribution, and the intermediate- or low-frequency semicircular
arc represents the grain-boundary or electrode-specimen effect.61 the bulk resistance Rb (dc resistance) of the sample is obtained from the intercept of
the semicircle on real axis Z′, and from this
figure, it is clearly specified that 1 possesses lower
resistance than that of 2. This lower bulk resistance
of 1 results in enhanced possibility of charge transfers
and reduces the charge recombination chances.

Conclusions
Here, two coordination polymeric compounds with
Pb(II) as node,
bdc2− and aiz as linkers, were isolated. The Pb(II)
coordination systems have been synthesized, structurally elucidated,
and well characterized. Isostructural compounds are utilized for studying
electrical conductivity. The I–V characteristics are determined for 1 and 2 in dark and illuminated conditions. From this study, at room temperature,
dark- and photo-conductivity values of 1 are calculated
as 2.94 × 10–6 and 6.12 × 10–6 S m–1, respectively, whereas for 2, the values of dark- and photo-conductivity are 2.92 × 10–7 and 3.66 × 10–7 S m–1, respectively. In the absorption of light, the compounds show increased
electrical conductivity. Thus, the compounds may be the potential
alternative for optoelectronic device fabrication. Higher distortion
and greater polarization in the structure of 1 may be
the reason for the faster charge mobility and higher conductivity
than those of 2.

Synthesis of 1
(E)-N′-(Thiophen-2-ylmethylene)isonicotinohydrazide
(aiz)
was prepared by stirring of isoniazid and thiophene-2-carbaldehyde
in dry MeOH solution for 6 h. A solution of aiz (0.046 g, 0.2 mmol)
in dimethylformamide (DMF)/MeOH (1:10 v/v) (2 mL) was gently and sensibly
layered in a solution of Pb(NO3)2 (0.066 g,
0.2 mmol), in 2 mL of H2O taking 2 mL of DMF buffer solution
followed by layering with H2bdc (0.033 g, 0.2 mmol, neutralized
with Et3N, 0.04 g, 0.4 mmol) in 2 mL of EtOH. Brown needle-shaped
crystals of 1 were found after 2 weeks (0.123 g, yield
69%). Elemental analysis (calcd %) for C23H15N3O7Pb2S: C 30.97, H 1.70, N 4.71;

Synthesis of 2
2 was prepared
following the same technique as used for the synthesis of 1, except the use of buffer solution, H2O/MeOH (1:1, v/v)
instead of DMF. The red prismatic crystals of [Pb2(bdc)1.5(aiz)(MeOH)2]n (2) were acquired after seven days (0.142 g, yield 74%). Elemental

Theoretical
Calculations
The Gaissian-09 program with
the DFT-B3LYP hybrid function was used to carry out DFT computations
for determining the correlation between theoretically and experimentally
obtained band gaps.62,63 For C, H, and N, the 6-31G (d)
basis set was allocated, and for Pb, LanL2DZ was used. The SCXRD coordinates
were taken for the compounds during the calculations. In the experimental
spectra, low-lying electronic transitions of the compounds were acquired
from TD-DFT calculations.64,65 GaussSum was used to
calculate the fractional contribution in the metal-ion-centered molecular
orbital and ligand-based molecular orbital.66
