In this study, two
respective groups of RNA aptamers have been
selected against two main classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparosan,
and chondroitin, as they have proven difficult to specifically detect
in biological samples. GAGs are linear, anionic, polydisperse polysaccharides
found ubiquitously in nature, yet their detection remains problematic.
GAGs comprised repeating disaccharide units, consisting of uronic
acid and hexosamine residues that are often also sulfated at various
positions. Monoclonal antibodies are frequently used in biology and
medicine to recognize various biological analytes with high affinity
and specificity. However, GAGs are conserved across the whole animal
phylogenic tree and are nonimmunogenic in hosts traditionally used
for natural antibody generation. Thus, it has been challenging to
obtain high affinity, selective antibodies that recognize various
GAGs. In the absence of anti-GAG antibodies, glycobiologists have
relied on the use of specific enzymes to convert GAGs to oligosaccharides
for analysis by mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, while these methods
are sensitive, they can be labor-intensive and cannot be used for
in situ detection of intact GAGs in cells and tissues. Aptamers are
single-stranded oligonucleotide (DNA or RNA) ligands capable of high
selectivity and high affinity detection of biological analytes. Aptamers
can be developed in vitro by the systematic evolution of ligands by
exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize nonimmunogenic targets,
including neutral carbohydrates. This study utilizes the SELEX method
to generate RNA aptamers, which specifically bind to the unmodified
GAGs, heparosan, and chondroitin. Binding confirmation and cross-screening
with other GAGs were performed using confocal microscopy to afford
three specific GAGs to each target. Affinity constant of each RNA
aptamer was obtained by fluorescent output after interaction with
the respective GAG target immobilized on plates; the KD values were determined to be 0.71–1.0 μM
for all aptamers. Upon the success of chemical modification (to stabilize
RNA aptamers in actual biological systems) and fluorescent tagging
(to only visualize RNA aptamers) of these aptamers, they would be
able to serve as a specific detection reagent of these important GAGs
in biological samples.

Introduction
Glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs) are linear acidic polysaccharides comprising
repeating disaccharide structures of uronic acid and hexosamine residues
that are ubiquitously found in all animal tissues.1 These polysaccharides are responsible for critical functions
in development, normal physiology, and pathophysiology.2 The study of the GAG structure is essential in
developing structure–activity relationships and has been intensively
investigated.3,4 Because GAGs are polydispersive
and often microheterogenous, structural elucidation is exceedingly
difficult and is well behind the structural characterization of other
important biopolymers, such as nucleic acids and proteins.5 Structurally simple (unmodified) GAGs, such as
heparosan (HE), hyaluronan (HA), and chondroitin (CH), are expressed
by human and animal pathogenic and commensal bacteria as capsules
and are used as molecular camouflage.6,7 However, animal-derived
GAGs are biosynthesized in the golgi by a nontemplate-driven process,
making it difficult to rely on deriving structural insights through
understanding GAG biosynthesis.1,8 The simple GAG polysaccharide
backbone is commonly modified by N- and/or O-sulfation and epimerization
in the golgi affording highly complex GAGs. Most of what we know about
the GAG structure comes from their controlled chemical or enzymatic
depolymerization to disaccharide or oligosaccharide structures that
are somewhat easier to characterize than intact GAG polysaccharides.9,10 There have recently been major advances in mass spectrometric methods
that have allowed the sequencing of small intact GAGs,5 yet complete structural characterization remains elusive.

Antibodies, particularly monoclonal antibodies prepared using hybridoma
technology, have been useful tools for solving the structure of protein
biopolymers.11 GAG structures across animal
species are so similar that GAGs derived from one animal are generally
not immunogenic when administered to another, and the only reported
GAG reactivity is in autoimmune disease sera.12 Antibodies generated to GAGs are therefore typically generated against
the protein cores of proteoglycans carrying GAGs or unnatural structural
features introduced to GAGs through chemical or enzymatic processes.13 This severely limits the repertoire of antibodies
available for studying the GAG structure. Proteins obtained using
phage display-based directed evolution have been reported to recognize
GAG structures,14,15 as these are not dependent on
an immune response for their generation. While these specific GAG
binding ligands allow in situ assessment of intact GAGs in tissues,
they display relatively weak binding affinities.14

A rapidly emerging type of molecular ligand for recognizing
targets
with high specificity and affinity is the nucleic acid aptamer. Aptamers
are single-stranded RNA or DNA of 20–100 nucleotides, which
can be generated through the systematic evolution of ligands by the
exponential enrichment (SELEX) strategy and can bind to specific molecular
targets.16,17 Structural motifs of aptamers, such as stem
loops, and ionic interactions play major roles in facilitating specific
recognition of a target ligand.18 RNA aptamers
having relatively low molecular weights, compared to proteins, are
easy to synthesize in large quantities using automated oligonucleotide
synthesis19 or in vitro transcription20 and have been applied in biological and clinical
applications. Furthermore, RNAs can be modified structurally and chemically
to be resistant to nuclease degradation.21

Although RNA aptamers have been used in sandwich assays with
lectins
to analyze glycoforms,22 there are only
a few examples of aptamers that were evolved to recognize carbohydrates.23−26 Basic carbohydrates, such as the amino-substituted trisaccharide
tobramycin, strongly interact with an acidic RNA aptamer through ion
pairing.23 DNA aptamers designed for neutral
carbohydrates, such as cellulose, interact specifically but with lower
binding affinities of 3–6 μM.24 Recently, oligonucleotide aptamers for neutral monosaccharides,
termed “low-epitope targets”, have been improved through
complexation with ternary boronic acids, to become “high-epitope
organic receptors” for these targets.26 In addition, RNA aptamers have recently been reported to be capable
of recognizing a sialic acid-terminated glycan with relatively high
binding affinities of 1–5 nM.25 Nonetheless,
no aptamers have been reported to date to interact with polyanionic
(highly negatively charged) carbohydrates with high selectivity and
good binding affinity.

In the current study, we describe the
first preparation and characterization
of two groups of RNA aptamers that are evolved using the SELEX strategy
and able to interact with two respective polyanionic carbohydrates,
HE and CH, with high specificity and submicromolar binding affinity.

Results
and Discussion
Aptamer Selection
A directed evolution
strategy involving
SELEX with a special negative selection procedure was used in this
study to obtain RNA aptamers that selectively interact with HE or
CH (Figure 1). The
RNA aptamer was first chosen over the DNA aptamer because RNA has
significantly increased conformational flexibility. Because of the
negatively charged nature of both GAG and nucleic acid species, we
speculated that the increased conformational flexibility imparted
by RNA would fortify the optimal selection of a high binding aptamer
to the target GAG. RNAs with certain consensus sequences (mainly G3A clusters) are often predominately enriched during SELEX
because of the strong interaction with the solid support (e.g., agarose/magnetic
beads and cellulous membrane) used to immobilize the targets of interest,
even though such solid support has already been utilized for negative
selection.27 The presence of such “background-binding”
RNAs makes it much harder and sometimes impossible to enrich desired
aptamers that specifically bind to the targets of interest.27 Our initial SELEX trial confirmed this previous
observation as the predominant RNA recovered after aptamer selection
(against HE immobilized on the magnetic beads) also contained G3A clusters (HE-03 with 20/28 sequence hit, group “A”
of Table S1). This was the case even though
the blank magnetic beads were used as negative selection in each round
of SELEX to remove the “background-binding” RNAs.

Figure 1 SELEX method
for obtaining RNA aptamers to GAGs. A random oligonucleotide
library is incubated with GAG-coated magnetic beads. Nonspecifically
bound oligonucleotides are washed off, and a negative selection is
carried out before reiterating the process for a total of 10 more
times.

We used DNA oligonucleotides carrying
the sequence complementary
to the consensus clusters of “background-binding” RNAs
to overcome this problem. After each selection round DNA/RNA duplexes
are formed, and the hybridized “background-binding”
RNAs are subjected to RNase-H digestion. Therefore, in this modified
SELEX process, a group of DNA oligonucleotides (Table S3), including those employed in the study by Shi et
al.,27 was used to quench the “background-binding”
RNAs in the enriched RNA population. As a result, we obtained two
respective groups of candidate RNA aptamers with 12 additional unique
sequences against HE (referred as HE-## in group “B”
of Table S1) and 39 unique sequences against
CH (referred as CH-## in Table S2). More
than 85% (73 out of 85) sequenced clones of these newly evolved candidate
RNA aptamers did not contain the consensus cluster sequences found
in group A, indicating that this sophisticated negative selection
strategy was able to effectively suppress the enrichment of “background-binding”
RNA in SELEX.

Confirmation of the Interaction of Candidate
RNA Aptamers with
Respective GAGs
We next used confocal microscopy to directly
visualize RNA–GAG interactions suggested by SELEX results to
confirm the interaction of evolved candidate RNA aptamers with the
respective GAG targets (HE or CH). Each candidate RNA aptamer was
first incubated with the same GAG-magnetic bead sample used for its
generation. After thorough washing to remove unbound RNA molecules,
nucleic acid-specific binding fluorophore, SYBR Green II, was added,
and the beads were imaged by confocal microscopy. Additionally, blank
magnetic beads were used in the same way to filter out the unique
“background-binding” RNAs in the pool of candidate RNA
aptamers. As displayed in Figures S4 and S5, 10 HE and 12 CH candidate RNA aptamers (Table 1) were found to show much stronger interaction
with the corresponding GAG-bead sample than with blank magnetic beads
(Figure 2). On the
basis of the sequence alignment (Figure S6), we observed that most of these RNA aptamers do not share a conserved
sequence motif. We hypothesize that either some of these aptamers
lack binding specificity to the respective GAG targets (discussion
below) or they might fold into different tertiary structures that
can interact with different regions of the same GAG molecule. The
latter hypothesis will require further investigation, including computational
simulation approaches.

is in bold.

On the basis
of confocal microscopy imaging, we noticed that although
the number of HE and HA molecules immobilized to the beads are higher
than that of CH, the number of bound aptamers, indicated by the fluorescence
density of RNA, is similar for each GAG studied. We speculate that
although higher GAG coverage on the beads is supposed to provide more
RNA aptamer binding sites, the higher steric hindrance caused by the
denser neighboring GAGs and higher molecular repulsions generated
between the immobilized GAG and RNA also need to be taken into consideration.
In addition, the future study of the minimal aptamer binding domain
of the GAG may help to explain such correlation between the fluorescence
density and the GAG coverage on the beads.

Aptamer Selectivity Screening
Because different classes
of GAG polymers share common sugar backbone structural features, it
is highly possible that some of the evolved RNA molecules may cross-react
with a closely related GAG class. Therefore, we next examined the
binding specificity/selectivity of the evolved RNA aptamers toward
their target GAG. For this purpose, we also used the same confocal
microscopy-based screening strategy to examine the binding specificity
of each RNA aptamer toward the three common unmodified GAG classes,
HE, CH, and HA. On the basis of the confocal microscopy imaging data
(Figures 3, S7, and S8) and average fluorescence intensity
quantification (Figure 4), we identified three HE (HE-08, HE-13 and HE-14) and three CH (CH-09,
CH-20 and CH-32) aptamers that were bound specifically and showed
no detectable interactions with the other two control GAG molecules.
On the basis of the sequence alignment, three HE- or CH-specific binding
aptamers share tentative discontinuous sequence motifs (boxed in Figure 5) with at least 3-nt
long consensus identity shared by at least two aptamers. In addition
to these selective aptamers to HE and CH, we have observed that HE-01,
-06, -09, -10, and -17 are also able to recognize HE and HA, whereas
CH-03, -04, and -35 recognize CH and HA. On the basis of the targets
they have shown to recognize, we speculate that HE-08, -13, and -14
may recognize the GlcNAc residue and α-linkage between GlcNAc
and GlcA in HE, whereas HE-01, -06, -09, -10, and -17 can also recognize
both GlcA and GlcNAc residues in HE and HA. Similarly, CH-09, -20,
and -32 may recognize GalNAc residues and β-linkages in CH,
whereas CH-03, -04, and -35 may recognize the β-linkage only
in CH and HA. Although we can speculate the interaction was based
on the structural components of the GAG targets and what aptamers
were able to recognize each GAG, further studies relying on experimental
and computational modeling are required to fully elucidate such sequence–function
relationship. Nevertheless, our ability to obtain GAG recognizing
RNA aptamers with high selectivity sets the stage for future applications
of aptamers in polysaccharide recognition in the fields of biology
and medicine.

Determination of Aptamer-GAG
Binding Affinity
The apparent
dissociation constant (KD) was next measured
to determine the aptamer–GAG binding affinity. Various concentrations
of the RNA aptamer (0–4.5 μM) were first added to a constant
amount of its respective GAG immobilized on a 96-well microplate.
After washing off unbound RNAs, RiboGreen was added, and the fluorescence
intensity was quantified using a plate reader. Saturation curves were
obtained by plotting the fluorescence intensity of GAG–RNA
binding complex, a function of RNA aptamer concentration.

The
saturation curves of RNA aptamers HE-08, HE-13, and HE-14 to HE are
shown in Figure 6A.
The KD value of each aptamer was extrapolated
using nonlinear regression analysis (Table S5). Aptamers HE-08 and HE-14 show very similar KD values for HE, 0.75 and 0.71 μM, respectively, whereas
HE-13 shows a slightly larger KD value
of 1.0 μM. The saturation curves of aptamers, CH-09, CH-20,
and CH-32, binding to CH are shown in Figure 6B. On the basis of the nonlinear regression
analyses (Table S5), aptamer CH-20 and
CH-32 show higher affinity to CH with KD values of 0.76 and 0.89 μM respectively, whereas CH-09 shows
slightly lower affinity with a KD value
of 1.0 μM. These aptamers have comparable binding capabilities
for their respective target when compared to many GAG-interacting
proteins.28 Therefore, we suggest that
these aptamers have the potential to serve in practical biological
and medical applications.

constants
(KD) of RNA aptamers specific to (A) HE:
HE-08, HE-13, and HE-14 and to (B) CH: CH-09, CH-20, and CH-32. A
control of immobilized biotin was used in both cases. KD values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis
based on the saturation curves.

Although the HE and CH aptamers have been evolved, screened,
and
validated to specifically target unsulfated GAG classes, we speculate
that they may also interact with their closely-related sulfated GAGs,
such as heparan sulfate, a highly sulfated chemical analog of HE,29 heparin that contains some HE sequences,4 and CH sulfate, a modified version of CH. Therefore,
in a preliminary test in this report, we have screened the three specific
HE aptamers (HE-08, HE-13, and HE-14) against immobilized heparin
(Figure S10). Only one aptamer, HE-14,
showed binding to heparin with an apparent KD of 0.87 μM (Table S5) but
with significantly lower fluorescence intensity compared to interaction
with HE. Interactions of HE-08 and HE-13 with heparin were comparable
to the control, and affinities were not calculated. Although the disaccharide
structural unit of HE is also present in heparin, it contains many
sulfated glucosamine, uronic acid residues, and epimerized iduronic
acid residues.1 Therefore, although it
is possible that the aptamers can interact with these modified versions
of their intended target, we speculate that the weaker binding of
the HE aptamers to heparin is due to stronger ionic repulsions between
the aptamers and this highly sulfated GAG. Because the overall fluorescence
intensity of HE-14 binding to HE is much higher than that of HE-14
binding to heparin, we still assert the three HE aptamers are target-specific.
SELEX would probably need to be performed starting with the initial
RNA library and an immobilized heparin target to obtain an RNA aptamer
specific to heparin.

Conclusions
Using SELEX with a sophisticated
negative selection strategy, two
small libraries of RNA aptamers were generated against the simple
(unmodified) GAGs, HE and CH. Positive binding was confirmed for approximately
one-third of the members of each RNA aptamer library using a confocal
fluorescence assay. When the HE and CH aptamers were cross-screened
using the same assay, about one-third of these positive binding aptamers
showed specific binding to the simple (unmodified) GAG used in its
generation. Ultimately, three positive binding and specific aptamers
for each of the two unmodified GAGs were obtained. The binding affinity
(KD) of these specific aptamers ranged
from high nanomolar to low micromolar and were similar among the HE
and CH classes. Typical binding affinities between a protein and its
polysaccharide target are often comparable, suggesting that these
aptamers have good binding capabilities for their respective targets.28

Though there is much more work that can
be done to improve upon
these aptamers, the molecular interaction of the RNA aptamers with
respective GAGs might be computationally modeled and elucidated in
the future, and the suspected RNA bases at the RNA–GAG interface
can be further degenerated for another round of SELEX.30 In addition, many modifications are available
to tune the binding affinity and stability.21 Aptamer truncation and nucleobase modification can be explored to
increase binding affinity,21 whereas incorporation
of naturally conserved RNA motifs can be used to provide stability
during in vivo applications.31,32

This study also
details a robust method for immobilizing GAGs to
a solid support that is useful for the selection of aptamers to the
target GAGs. Though we immobilized HA onto magnetic beads, we did
not select aptamers for this GAG as it had the least potential for
therapeutic and diagnostic outcomes. With this experimental setup
in place, HA and modified versions of each GAG can undergo selection
for RNA aptamers specific to the intended target.

Future Work
In this study, unmodified HE and CH were used for selection and
aptamers were only cross-screened for specificity among the unmodified
classes (including HA). The HE and CH are modified in vivo, resulting
in higher ordered structures of GAGs. These highly modified animal-sourced
GAGs contain stretches of unmodified domains identical to the GAGs
used to generate the RNA aptamers. Beyond our preliminary test regarding
this aspect, it will therefore be important to further screen the
selected aptamers against their modified counterparts. In brief, HE
aptamers should be tested for interaction with heparan sulfate, and
CH aptamers should be tested for interaction with CH sulfate. This
could reveal some aptamers that are not wholly specific to their intended
target. With their ability to specifically detect the respective GAG
targets, these RNA aptamers could serve as novel molecular tags and
analytical/molecular biology tools for GAG structural recognition
in complex mixtures.

Ultimately, we plan on applying future
generations of these RNA
aptamers in cell systems. Notable areas of interest include utilizing
the aptamers as a means to sense GAGs shed from the glycocalyx under
various stressors or disease states, to visualize GAG patterning of
the glycocalyx or endothelium, and to detect and regulate the GAG-dependent
cell signaling interactions and cell differentiation (Figure 7). For these aptamers to be
effectively applicable, they must undergo some modifications such
as chemical modifications to the individual bases, RNA truncation
for improving RNA stability, and fluorescent labeling for tracking
and imaging aptamers.

can
be modified with molecular beacons for sensing capability, whereby
fluorescence occurs after interaction with GAG. (B) Fluorescently
labeled aptamers interact with GAGs to visually pattern various mammalian
cell types glycocalyx.

These modifications and applications of the aptamers in cell
systems
are not trivial and will require great effort to carry out systematic
studies of the resulting binding interaction before and after modification.
As elaborated below, we plan to execute this systematic study to (1)
develop a robust modified RNA aptamer capable of sensing and (2) to
understand the binding interaction of RNA and GAG and the underlying
mechanisms of the aptamer selectivity. (1) “Vanilla”
RNA aptamers can be easily degraded in actual biological systems because
of the presence of active nucleases. We will need to chemically modify
the RNA bases or truncate the RNA aptamer to improve the RNA stability
in the presence of nucleases. However, to minimize or avoid the loss
of aptamer’s binding specificity and affinity to GAG targets,
we need to use both computational modeling and experiments to elucidate
the functional core of the RNA aptamers, to find out the bases that
are not responsible for actual binding, and to finally test whether
the chemical modifications on or deletion of those bases will undermine
the binding of those “vanilla” RNA aptamers initially
obtained by SELEX. In addition, we need to develop an effective chemistry
to covalently label the RNA aptamers with respective fluorophores,
which need to be verified as not interfering with the aptamers’
interaction with their respective GAG targets. (2) As the aptamers
likely bind to a small portion of the total GAG and that different
aptamers act on different domains of the GAG, we plan to test the
current RNA aptamers against varying degrees of polymerization of
the target GAGs to elucidate the smallest unit required for aptamer–GAG
interaction. We would also like to use the binding information on
computational studies to model the interaction and to predict the
types of sequences that would generate high binding affinity aptamers
to various GAGs.

Experimental Procedures
Preparation and Characterization
of Unsulfated GAGs
HE33 and CH34 were respectively prepared from E. coli K5 (ATCC #23506) and recombinant E. coli K5 cultured on glucose. HA from Streptococcus zooepidemicus was provided by Professor
Toshihiko Toida (Chiba University, Japan).
More than 95% purity of each GAG sample is confirmed by nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (Figure S1) and
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS, Figures S2 and S3),33,34 which prove the high purity (HE >97%, heparin >99%, CH >95%,
and
hyaluronic acid >99%) of the GAG samples used in this study. Molecular
weight of each GAG sample was determined by high-performance liquid
gel permeation chromatography, according to the official monograph
for heparin35 with minor modifications.36 Average molecular weight for HE, HA, and CH
are 37.7, 125, and 36.4 kDa respectively.

Immobilization of GAGs
on the Magnetic Microbeads
Unsulfated
GAGs, HE, CH, and HA, were each covalently linked through their reducing
ends to amine-functionalized magnetic microparticles (1.0 μm,
herein simply referred to as “magnetic beads”) obtained
from Chemicell GmbH (Berlin, Germany). More specifically, reductive
amination was carried out by mixing 2 mg of GAG (1 mg in the case
of CH) and 30 mg of amine-functionalized magnetic beads in 10 mL of
dimethylsulfoxide that contained 15% glacial acetic acid (v/v) and
reacted in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride (5 mg) for 120
h at 70 °C. Sodium cyanoborohydride (5 mg) was replenished every
24 h. The reaction was stopped by decreasing the temperature to 25
°C. Then, the beads were washed exhaustively with 1 M NaCl to
remove noncovalently associated polysaccharide. Reductive amination
afforded immobilized GAGs, in an “end-on” orientation
with attachment through their reducing ends, which will allow for
larger surface area coverage and greater accessibility of GAG subunits
and closely mimic the bacterial capsule and mammalian glycocalyx.

Next, to reduce nonspecific ionic interactions of the nucleic acid
backbone with the beads, unreacted primary amines on the beads were
blocked by converting to N-acetyl groups with acetic
anhydride/water/tetrahydrofuran (v/v/v, 1/4/4). “Blank”
magnetic beads utilized in the negative selection or as a negative
control in confocal microscopy-based screening were subjected to only
the blocking treatment. Amount of each beads-immobilized GAG was quantified
(Table S6) by conducting the standard disaccharide
analysis following GAG digestion using appropriate polysaccharide
lyases.10,37

In Vitro RNA Aptamer Selection
An
RNA library that
contains 30-nt long degenerated sequences flanked by constant primer
binding regions was obtained from TriLink Biotechnologies Inc. (see
sequence in Table S4). To select the RNA
aptamers targeting HE or CH GAGs, a 5 nmol RNA library (containing
∼3 × 1015 unique RNA molecules) was suspended
in the binding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2). For the initial round of selection, the library was incubated
with 10 μL of GAG-coated magnetic beads for 2 h under shaking
(200 rpm) before being thoroughly washed five times to remove the
nonspecific-binding RNA. The resulting RNAs bound to the target GAG
were recovered by reversing the RNA–GAG interaction by heating
at 85 °C for 3 min. The solution containing the eluted RNAs was
extracted and concentrated using phenyl/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
(v/v/v, 25/24/1) (PCA) extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.
The recovered RNAs from the previous selection round were reverse-transcribed
using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher
Sci) and PCR-amplified to obtain DNA templates for making the RNA
library for the subsequent selection using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription
Kit (ThermoFisher Sci). Starting from the second selection round,
before mixing the library with the target GAG as described above,
the newly transcribed RNA library will be hybridized with the “negative-selection”
DNA oligo mixture (Table S3), followed
by RNase-H digestion to remove the “background-binding”
RNAs, DNase digestion to remove the “negative-selection”
DNA, and cleaned by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. For
each GAG, 10 rounds of selection were conducted before the enriched
RNAs were Sanger-sequenced for their identity. It should be noted
that to enrich the RNA aptamers for those with high binding affinity,
the RNA–GAG incubation conditions varied as the selection progressed:
during rounds 1–4, the RNA library was incubated with 20 μL
of GAG beads for 2 h with shaking at 200 rpm; for rounds 5–8,
the RNA library was incubated with 10 μL of GAG beads for 1
h with shaking at 200 rpm; for rounds 9–10, the RNA library
was incubated with 10 μL of GAG beads for only 30 min with shaking
on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm.

Sequence Identification
and Analysis
After the 10th
round of selection, the enriched RNA molecules were RT-PCRed into
double-stranded DNAs, which were subsequently cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO
vector using the TOP TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies)
and amplified in E. coli TOP10 cells.
Colonies containing cDNAs of 51 HE-targeting and 62 CH-targeting RNAs
were Sanger-sequenced by Genscript Biotech. All the sequences were
further compiled and analyzed using the alignment algorithm embedded
in Geneious (Biomatters Inc). Note that the purified plasmids containing
interested cDNA inserts were kept and used in in vitro transcription
to produce specific RNA molecules for the downstream binding and selectivity
assays.

RNA–GAG Interaction and Selectivity Screening
For each candidate RNA aptamer, 20 μL of 1 μM (quantified
by Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Kit) RNA solution was mixed with 10 μL
GAG beads or blank beads in 70 μL binding buffer and incubated
in an Eppendrof tube at room temperature for 2 h with shaking at 200
rpm. Excess or unbound RNA molecules were then removed after washing
five times using binding buffer. Then, SYBR Green II dye was added
according to the manufacture’s protocol, and the interaction
of RNA with GAG beads or blank beads was characterized by a Zeiss
LSM 510META Spectral Confocal Microscope using 488 nm excitation laser
and a 520 nm emission filter. The average fluorescence density of
each interaction was quantified in ImageJ (NIH) by normalizing the
average fluorescence intensity of the confocal micrographs to their
ratio of the fluorescence area to total area. This therefore reflects
the amount of GAG-bound RNA molecules. The same procedure was used
to screen the binding specificity of the selected candidate HE and
CH aptamers to HE, CH, and HA GAGs immobilized on the magnetic beads.

GAG Biotinylation
The carboxyl groups of each GAG were
first activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) in
order to biotinylate the GAGs. GAG (5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of
0.1 M 2-[morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 4.7. EDC (0.5 mg)
and sulfo-NHS (1.5 mg) were added and stirred at room temperature
for 15 min. Next, concentrated (10×) phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2) was
added to adjust the pH to ∼7.0. Finally, amine-PEG3-biotin
(2.5 mg) in 1 mL of PBS buffer was added to the activated GAGs and
allowed to react for 10 h at room temperature. Postreaction, excess
biotin molecules were removed by washing excessively with 1 M NaCl
and then water using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL centrifugal filter [3
kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO)]. Successful GAG biotinylation
was confirmed by NMR analysis (Figure S9).

Immobilization of Biotinylated GAG to a Microplate
Black 96-well streptavidin-coated microplate (ThermoFisher Sci) wells
were washed three times using 200 μL Trisbuffered saline wash
buffer (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 containing 0.1% BSA, and 0.05%
Tween-20 detergent). Next, a solution containing biotinylated GAG
(100 μL of 0.05 mg/mL) was added and incubated at room temperature
for 2 h with shaking at 200 rpm. Amine-PEG3-biotin was used as a negative
control after being immobilized to a separate microplate. The amount
of total GAG immobilized onto the microplate was quantified (Table S6) by disaccharide analysis using LC–MS
as described below.

LC–MS-Based Disaccharide Analysis
Standard LC–MS-based
disaccharide analysis was carried out to quantify the amount of GAG
molecules immobilized to a microplate. For HE, the GAG was hydrolyzed
by recombinant Flavobacterial heparin lyases I, II, and III,10 whereas CH and HA were hydrolyzed using CH lyase
ABC, all expressed in E. coli.10 The enzymatic digests were then purified by
Ultra-0.5 mL Centrifugal Filters (10 kDa MWCO) and lyophilized before
the LC–MS analysis (below).

The dried samples were AMAC-labeled
by adding 10 μL of 0.1 M AMAC in DMSO/acetic acid (v/v, 17/3)
and incubating at room temperature for 10 min, followed by the addition
of 10 μL of 1 M aqueous NaBH3CN and incubating for
1 h at 45 °C. The resulting samples were centrifuged at 13 200
rpm for 10 min. Finally, each supernatant was collected and stored
in a light-resistant container at room temperature until analyzed
by LC–MS.

LC was performed on an Agilent 1200 LC system
at 45 °C using
an Agilent Poroshell 120 ECC18 (2.7 μm, 3.0 × 50 mm) column
with two mobile phases (A: 50 mM ammonium acetate aqueous solution,
and B: methanol). The mobile phase passed through the column at a
flow rate of 250 μL/min and a gradient of 0–12.5 min,
15–27.5% B; 12.5–13 min, 27.5–100% B; 13–16
min, 100% B; 16–16.2 min, 100–15% B. An Agilent 6300
ion trap equipped with an ESI source was coupled online. The full-scan
(300–900Da) MS analysis was performed under the negative ionization
mode with a skimmer voltage of −40.0 V, a capillary exit of
−40.0 V, and a source temperature of 350 °C. Liquid nitrogen
was used as the drying and nebulizing gas at a flow rate of 8 L/min
and a pressure of 40 psi, respectively. To quantify the GAGs, unsaturated
disaccharide standards of CS (0SCS-0, 4SCS-A, 6SCS-C, 2SCS, 2S4SCS-B, 2S6SCS-D, 4S6SCS-E, TriSCS), HA (0SHA), and HS (0SHS, NSHS, 6SHS, 2SHS, 2SNSHS, NS6SHS, 2S6SHS, TriSHS) purchased from Iduron,
were run prior to the samples. Data analysis was performed using Agilent
ChemSolution software, and the resulting total sugar for each GAG
immobilized is listed in Table S6.

Binding
Affinity (KD) Determination
of Final RNA Aptamers
The binding affinity (quantified as KD) of the selected aptamers to their targets
was determined using a constant amount of GAG over a range of RNA
aptamer concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4.5 μM).
After adding RNA aptamer solution to the microplate wells with immobilized
GAG, the mixture was shaken (200 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature.
Postincubation, the microplate was washed three times (each shaking
for 3 min) with 200 μL binding buffer. Then, 100 μL RiboGreen
dye (200-fold dilution) was added to stain any RNA molecule bound
to the GAG. The amount of RNA–GAG binding complex was determined
by measuring the fluorescence intensity using a microplate reader
(excitation: 480 nm; emission: 520 nm). Saturation curves were obtained
by fitting the mean fluorescence intensity of aptamer–GAG complex
to the range of aptamer concentrations. Nonlinear regression was used
to determine KD values.
