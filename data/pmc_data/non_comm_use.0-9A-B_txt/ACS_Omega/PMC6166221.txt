Substitution of the m,p-chloro groups
of bis-benzylidinepiperidone
RA190 for p-nitro, generating RA183, enhanced covalent
drug binding to Cys88 of RPN13. Treatment of cancer cell lines with RA183
inhibited ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, resulting in rapid
accumulation of high-molecular-weight polyubiquitinated proteins,
blockade of NFκB signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, an
unfolded protein response, production of reactive oxygen species,
and apoptotic cell death. High-grade ovarian cancer, triple-negative
breast cancer, and multiple myeloma cell lines were particularly vulnerable
to RA183. RA183 stabilized a tetraubiquitin-linked firefly luciferase
reporter protein in cancer cell lines and mice, demonstrating in vitro
and in vivo proteasomal inhibition, respectively. However, RA183 was
rapidly cleared from plasma, likely reflecting its rapid degradation
to the active compound RA9, as seen in human liver microsomes. Intraperitoneal
administration of RA183 inhibited proteasome function and orthotopic
tumor growth in mice bearing human ovarian cancer model ES2-luc ascites
or syngeneic ID8-luc tumor.

Introduction
Ovarian
cancer exhibits
an increased
accumulation of misfolded and polyubiquitinated proteins that is associated
with a stressed ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), and this
occurs despite the coordinate upregulation of proteasome components.1 The resulting unfolded protein response (UPR)
is associated with an increased sensitivity to proteasomal inhibition.2,3ADRM1 is amplified and overexpressed in a significant
fraction of several cancers, most notably ovarian carcinoma.4−6ADRM1 encodes
human RPN13 that is associated with the 19S regulatory particle (RP)
of the proteasome by binding to RPN2.7−10 Knockdown of RPN13 expression
in ovarian and colorectal cancer cells by ADRM1 small
interfering RNA (siRNA) produces a toxic accumulation of polyubiquitinated
proteins and apoptosis, whereas overexpression is associated with
proliferation, migration, and growth in soft agar.11−15 In one study, RPN13-deficient mice not only survive
but reach normal body weight.16 A later
study17 found that loss of RPN13 causes
neonatal lethality in mice, but that RPN10 can compensate for RPN13
in the liver. Thus, RPN13 inhibitors could potentially be tolerable
and efficacious against ovarian and other cancers.

The proteasome
inhibitors bortezomib (Bz), carfilzomib, and ixazomib all target the
same β5 subunit of the 20S catalytic subunit, and iβ5
of the immunoproteasome,18 and are licensed
for treating multiple myeloma (MM).19 However,
they are associated with thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, and the eventual
emergence of resistance to the proteasome inhibitor.20 Despite activity against MM and promising in vitro activity
against ovarian cancer cell models, intravenous (i.v.) bortezomib
had no appreciable clinical activity against ovarian cancer in early
phase trials, either alone or in combination with carboplatin.21 New drugs targeting the 19S regulatory particle
(RP) of the proteasome may be able to improve activity against ovarian
cancer, overcome resistance in MM, and reduce side effects, including
immunosuppression.

Recently, we have described a bis-benzylidinepiperidone,
RA190, which covalently binds to cysteine residue 88 (Cys88) of RPN13
via Michael addition and is active against models of MM and ovarian
cancer.15,22−25 In seeking to improve
its potency, we identified RA183. We also noted structural similarities
between RA183 and the previously described cancer drug candidates
b-AP1526 and RA93,27 that
act as 19S RP deubiquitatinase inhibitors. Here, we compare their
properties and examine whether RA183 inhibits proteasomal degradation
and its potential for therapeutic activity against ovarian and other
cancer models.

Results and Discussion
RA183 Binds to RPN13 More
Strongly Than RA190
RA190 is structurally distinct from typical
Michael acceptors in
that the carbonyl moiety shares two alkenes and is attached at their
β-carbon to two substituted aromatic rings.22 We hypothesized that substitution of the m,p-chloro groups of RA190 with p-nitro (RA183, see Figure 1A), given its greater electron-withdrawing effect, might enhance
the nucleophilic attack of Cys88 from the 42 kDa proteasome RP protein
RPN13. To evaluate whether this substitution improves covalent binding
to RPN13, we also conjugated biotin to RA183 (RA183B) as a tag. By
comparison to the biotinylated version of RA190 (RA190B),22 a significantly stronger labeling of a 42 kDa
band (the apparent molecular weight of RPN13) was observed in the
RA183B-treated 19S RP (Figure 1B). Labeling of RPN13 was lost in 19S RP pretreated with RA183
and then incubated with RA190B or when the 19S RP sample was pretreated
with RA190 and then labeled with RA183B (Figure 1B). These results indicate that RA183 reacts
with RPN13 more strongly than RA190.

Figure 1 RA183 binding to RPN13 is stronger than
RA190.

in which a biotin moiety (blue) is linked to RA183, and likewise for
RA190B. (B) Purified 19S RP (200 ng) was labeled with RA183, RA190,
RA183B, or RA190B (20 μM) alone or in the presence of competitor
RA183 and RA190 (100 or 200 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C. After
labeling, equal aliquots were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE), transferred to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane,
probed with streptavidin peroxidase, and developed with chemiluminescence
for the recognition of biotinylated proteins. (C, D) Cell lines from
cancers of different tissue origins were lysed in Mammalian Protein
Extraction Reagent (M-PER). In addition, Escherichia
coli transduced with a plasmid expressing 6His and
T7 tag-labeled RPN13 or irrelevant antigen and induced with isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mM, 2 h) were lysed
in B-PER. Cell lysates (40 μg of protein) were treated with
5 μM RA183B (L) or not (C) for 45 min at 4 °C and subjected
to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–streptavidin. The asterisk corresponds to
∼42 kDa RPN13 band.

RA183 Binding Pattern in Cell Lines
We analyzed the binding
pattern of RA183B in extracts of cell lines of ovarian, breast, colon,
and cervical cancers and MM origin. A band of 42 kDa was detected
in each, suggesting RPN13 as the common primary target for RA183 in
cells of diverse origin (Figure 1C,D). Several, but not all cell lines showed weaker
labeling at ∼50 kDa, also seen upon labeling of 19S RP (Figure 1B). Notably, extracts
of bacteria induced to express tagged full-length human RPN13 labeled
at the expected size (Figure 1D).

RA183B Binds RPN13 Directly
in Cell Lysate
We sought to further confirm direct binding
to RPN13 in cell lysates using a precipitation assay. Briefly, RA183B-pretreated
or untreated SKOV3 cell lysate was denatured with 1% (w/v) SDS at
70 °C, then cooled, and finally diluted 10-fold. The biotinylated
proteins were collected on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, separated
with a magnet and washed exhaustively. Bead eluate was subjected to
Western blot analysis with antibody to RPN13 (Figure S1A). We observed pulldown of RPN13 from the RA183B-treated
lysate. This band was also labeled with HRP–streptavidin (Figure S1B), which indicates that RA183B directly
binds to RPN13. Diminished labeling of the 42 kDa target of RA183B
was observed in ADRM1 knockdown HeLa cells compared
to control, consistent with lower levels of RPN13 available for reaction
(Figure S1C–E).

RA183 Binds
to Cys88 of RPN13 Pru Domain, from Where
It Interacts with a Hydrophobic Cavity
RA190 adducts Cys88
of the RPN13 Pru domain.22 Comparison by 1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) NMR spectroscopy of the chemical shifts of 15N-labeled
human RPN13 Pru domain alone or preincubated with RA183 revealed shifted
signals for several residues (Figure 2A), including Cys88. A similar subset of RPN13 amino
acids was affected by RA183 addition as for RA190;22 however, RA183-bound RPN13 Pru yielded strong signals in
contrast to the signal loss observed for RA190-bound RPN13 Pru (Figure 2B). A peak consistent
with adduct formation between RA183 and the RPN13 Pru domain was observed
by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Figure 2C), indicating that
RA183, like RA190, binds covalently.

Figure 2 RA183 adducts to RPN13 Pru domain C88,
making hydrophobic
interactions in a neighboring pocket. (A) (1H, 15N) HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled RPN13 Pru domain alone

by dialysis (orange). Signals affected by RA183 are labeled. (B) Comparison
of RPN13 Pru domain with RA190 (left panels) and RA183 (right panels)
for G91 and C88 as indicated. In contrast to RA190, which causes severe
attenuation, most signals shift to an observable new location after
RA183 addition, as exemplified by G91 and C88. (C) LC–MS experiment
for RA183-exposed RPN13 Pru domain. Unmodified Rpn13 is present (expected
molecular weight of 17 017 Da) as well as an additional species
at a molecular weight shifted by 512.3 Da. The expected molecular
weight shift caused by RA183 attachment is 513 Da. The sample used
for this experiment is identical to (A). (D) Normalized peak intensity

or proline groups are excluded from this analysis and indicated by
*. (E) Lowest-energy structure of RPN13 Pru with RA183 adducted. The
data from (D) are mapped onto an RPN13 Pru domain ribbon diagram with
a red gradient, as indicated, and RA183 carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
atoms are displayed in blue, indigo, and red, respectively. (F) Expanded
view of the RPN13 Pru–RA183 complex, as shown in (E) to illustrate
interactions at the contact surface with key amino acids displayed
and labeled. (G) Selected regions of (1H, 13C) HSQC spectra acquired on 13C-labeled RPN13 Pru domain
alone (top) and after incubation with 10-fold molar excess unlabeled
RA183 (bottom). The M31 methyl group splits into multiple states following
RA183 addition.

In the presence of RA183,
signal shifting was not observed for 15N RPN13 Pru C88A
(in which cysteine 88 is replaced with alanine) by 1H–15N HSQC experiments (Figure S2A). In contrast, RA183 addition induced changes to the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of 15N RPN13 Pru
C60/80/121A (in which cysteine 60 and 80 and 121 of the Pru domain
are all replaced with alanine) (Figure S2B). Thus, RA183, like RA190, reacts with the thiol of Cys88 of RPN13
Pru.

We quantified the loss of signal from the RPN13 Pru unbound
state caused by RA183 incubation (Figure 2D). As previously measured for RA190,22 we found the most effected amino acids to localize
to a surface opposite to the ubiquitin-binding loops, which as expected
contains C88. We used the data plotted in Figure 2D to generate model structures for RPN13
Pru–RA183 by using High Ambiguity Driven protein–protein
DOCKing (HADDOCK) and crystallography and NMR system (CNS). The structure
calculations yielded three clusters (Figure S2C), similar to RA190, that all place RA183 in a cavity rich with hydrophobic
amino acids and with C88 at the periphery (Figures 2E and S2D).

In all cases, interactions are formed between either RA183 or RA190
and RPN13 Pru M31, V85, P89, V93, and F106; W108 also interacts with
the most populated cluster from RA190 and all structures calculated
for RA183. The most populated (56%) and lowest-energy configuration
for RPN13 Pru–RA183 directs the RA183 phenylalanine group toward
the side-chain atoms of RPN13 M31, T37, T39, and P40 (cluster 1);
the lowest-energy structure from this cluster is presented (Figure 2E). By contrast,
the RA190 phenylalanine group in the lowest-energy RPN13–RA190
structures is closer to F106 (Figure S2E).22 The placement for RA183 enables its
longer p-nitro group on the benzylidene ring to be
directed toward RPN13 R104 and F106 (Figure 2E). A p-nitro benzylidene
group adopts a similar configuration in the RPN13–RA183 structures
from cluster 2 (Figure S2D, left panel),
although these structures direct the RA183 phenylalanine group toward
V85 and P89 (Figure S2F). Cluster 3, which
contains 8% of the RPN13–RA183 structures, is similar to cluster
1, but with the p-nitro benzylidene farther from
R104 (Figure S2G, green vs blue). Compared
to the structures in clusters 1 and 2, the electrostatic energy of
structures in cluster 3 is higher because of lost interaction with
R104 (Figure S2C). This configuration,
however, features additional interactions for the other p-nitro benzylidene group in RA183 with M31, P40, V93, and W108 of
RPN13 Pru (Figure S2G, green vs blue).
All RPN13 Pru–RA183 structures from the three clusters have
an exposed amine group (Figures 2E and S2D), which is consistent
with the ability of biotinylated RA183 to bind to RPN13 Pru.

We propose that RA183 likely undergoes chemical exchange between
the various configurations represented in our three clusters. In particular,
our experimental data indicate the presence of multiple bound-state
configurations for RPN13 Pru–RA183, as illustrated by multiple
bound-state signals for the G91 amide group (Figure 2B) or M31 methyl group (Figure 2G).

RA183 Impacts RPN13 Interdomain
Interactions but Not Binding
to Ubiquitin
While RPN13 Pru domain binds to ubiquitin, its
other C-terminal DEUBAD domain binds to the deubiquitinating enzyme
UCH37.8−10,28,29 An 1H–15N HSQC study of full-length
RPN13 revealed signal shifting
in the presence of RA183 for amino acids of both domains (Figure 3A,B). As expected,
amino acids from the RPN13 Pru domain were affected by RA183, as demonstrated
for T39 and G91 (Figure 3B), and notably, so were residues L314 and M342 from the DEUBAD domain
and T273 of the interdomain region (Figure 3A,B). When not interacting with binding partners,
the two domains of RPN13 interact with each other, which causes signal
shifting for the RPN13 full-length protein in 1H–15N HSQC NMR spectra compared to RPN13 fragments that contain
only the Pru or DEUBAD domain.30 Therefore,
we compared spectra recorded on full-length RPN13 and RPN13 DEUBAD
domain to those recorded on full-length RPN13 mixed with RA183. The
comparison revealed RA183 to cause signal shifting that reflects the
truncated protein and thus loss of interaction with RPN13 Pru domain,
as exemplified by T273, L314, and M342 (Figure 3B).

respectively. (B, top) Expanded regions highlighting T39 and G91 of

(black) and after incubation with 10-fold molar excess RA183, followed
by buffer exchange to remove excess and labile RA183 (orange). (F)

with equimolar ubiquitin (orange). Resonances effected significantly
are labeled, and a comparison to unligated RPN13 (black) with ubiquitin
(orange) is provided for I75, which is at the ubiquitin-binding surface.

We previously found that RA190
adducts to C357 in the RPN13 DEUBAD domain; this interaction, however,
is more labile than RA190 covalent modification of C88,22,31 most likely because this site is surface exposed and does not offer
a favorable binding pocket. We tested for RA183 interaction with the
DEUBAD domain cysteine by LC–MS. Indeed, we observed RPN13
DEUBAD domain to be adducted by RA183 (Figure 3C, left), but in contrast to the Pru domain,
this interaction was lost following exchange to a buffer with no RA183
(Figure 3C, right),
thus supporting a more labile interaction at this location.

RPN13 C88 is proximal to the proteasome-binding site, which is contributed
by the C-terminal 14 amino acids in RPN2.32 Therefore, we tested whether RPN2 (940–953) interferes with
RA183 adduction to RPN13 Pru by using LC–MS. We added RA183
to RPN13 Pru domain preincubated with RPN2 (940–953). RA183-conjugated
RPN13 Pru domain was detected by LC–MS (Figure 3D, black); however, this species was not
detected in the presence of RPN2 (940–953) (Figure 3D, orange). Moreover, only
one RA183 molecule conjugated to full-length RPN13 preincubated with
RPN2 (940–953) (Figure 3E). Collectively, these findings suggest that RA183 targets
the RPN13 Pru domain when RPN13 is free from the proteasome, and the
DEUBAD domain when it is proteasome-bound.

We tested whether
RA183 interaction affects RPN13 Pru binding to ubiquitin. RPN13 Pru
was preincubated with RA183 and interaction was confirmed by a 1H–15N HSQC experiment (Figure 3F, black). Next, ubiquitin
was added to equimolarity. Signal shifting reflective of interaction
with ubiquitin was observed, indicating that RA183 does not inhibit
RPN13 Pru interaction with ubiquitin (Figure 3F, orange). For example, I75 shifts in an
identical manner whether RA183 is present or not (Figure 3F, inset).

Promiscuity
in RA183 Binding in Vitro
We
noted the structural similarity of RA183 to b-AP1526 and RA9,3,27 previously identified as DUB
inhibitors and candidate cancer therapeutics (Figure 1A), and in a previous study, found RA190
to interact with UCH37 in vitro.31 Indeed,
b-AP15 binds promiscuously in vitro, not only to its known targets
UCH37 and USP14, but also to RPN13 (Figure S3A–C) and adducts RPN13 Pru C88 (Figure S4). VLX1570, an analogue of b-AP15 being tested in MM patients (NCT02372240),
competed with binding of RA183B to RPN13 only at high concentrations,
well above its IC50 for cancer cell cytotoxicity (Figure S3D).

At 5 μM, RA183 exhibited 19S RP DUB
inhibition in vitro (Figure S5A) and competed
with HA-UbVS labeling of USP14. However, only limited inhibition of
HA-UbVS labeling of UCH37 was apparent at even 25 μM RA183 (Figure S5B), although it could bind directly
to purified UCH37 (Figure S5C). RA183 did
not impact 20S CP proteolytic activities (Figure S5D–F).

RA183 Inhibits
NF-κB Activation
We hypothesized that RA183 treatment
inhibits the activation of NF-κB by preventing the proteasomal
degradation of IκB-α. IκB-α degradation at
20 min after the addition of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)
was inhibited by RA183 (Figure 4A,B), and this coincides with an accumulation of total polyubiquitinated
proteins (Figure 4C).
Further, in HEK 293 cells carrying an NF-κB-Luc reporter, RA183
produced a dose-dependent decrease in NF-κB-associated promoter
activity (Figure 4D).
Similar results were also obtained with RA190 and bortezomib (Figure 4D).

Figure 4 RA183
blocks NFκB
signaling and irreversibly induces cell death. (A) HeLa cells were
simultaneously treated with 10 ng/mL TNFα and 1 μM RA183
(right) or 10 ng/mL TNFα only as a control (left). Whole cell
lysates were prepared at the indicated times and analyzed by Western
blot for IκB and β-tubulin levels. (B) HeLa cells were

Two hundred ninety-three cells transiently transfected 1 day earlier
with a luciferase reporter construct driven by either an NFκB-dependent
promotor (NFκB-Luc) or a constitutive promoter (Luc) were treated
with the compounds indicated and TNFα (10 ng/mL) for 7 h. Upon
the addition of luciferin, bioluminescence was measured in cell lysates
using a luminometer. The % activation of the NFκB-dependent
promoter (normalized by the constitutive reporter construct) as compared
to TNFα stimulation in the absence of compound is presented.
(E) SKOV3 cells were treated with compounds (0.5 μM) for 4 h,
lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis with Ub antibody. (F)
SKOV3 cells were treated with bortezomib, RA190, cisplatin, or RA183
(1 μM) for 12 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot
analysis with antibody to ubiquitin. (G, H) The viability of HeLa
cells treated with bortezomib (G) or RA183 (H) or at the indicated
concentrations for 24 h (+, +) was compared to 1 h treatment with
the same compounds at the same concentrations, after which the cells
were washed and the medium was replaced without compounds and incubated
for a further 23 h (+, −). Cell viability was measured by the
XTT method.

Activity of RA183 against
Cancer Cells
An initial survey of cytotoxicity for a panel
of epithelial cancer
cell lines suggested that ovarian, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),
and colon cancer cells were sensitive to RA183 (Table S1). Bortezomib-treated patients often develop resistance.33 We tested RA183 against two MM cell lines that
were selected for resistance by extended culture in bortezomib and
it was similarly efficacious against both the bortezomib-resistant
derivative lines and their parental lines, consistent with a distinct
mode of action from bortezomib (Table S1).

RA183 Triggers Rapid Accumulation
of High-Molecular-Weight Polyubiquitinated Proteins
Treatment
with RA183 caused a rapid accumulation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitinated
proteins (Figure 4E,F),
but b-AP15 was less potent. Importantly, bortezomib produced a buildup
of lower-molecular-weight Lys48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins
compared to RA183, consistent with its targeting of the 20S subunit
and suggesting that RA183 prevents deubiquitination of proteasome
substrates by 19S RP.

Irreversible
Action of RA183
The cytotoxicity of RA183 was not reversed
by washout, consistent with an irreversible inhibitor, whereas the
cells recovered significantly after washout of bortezomib, as expected
(Figure 4G,H).

RA183
Induces Unresolved Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Apoptosis
Accumulation of unfolded proteins upon the inhibition of proteasome
function by RA183 rapidly induces an unresolved unfolded protein response
(UPR) and apoptosis, a mechanism associated with bortezomib-induced
cytotoxicity,34 as demonstrated by rapid
upregulation of CHOP-10 (Figure 5A), BIP (Figure 5B), and spliced XBP1 mRNA (Figure 5C)
and ATF4, all important effectors of UPR (Figure 5D). Cleavage of PARP, elevated levels of
the apoptotic protein BAX (Figure 5E), and production of reactive oxygen species (Figure 5F) and apoptotic
cells were detected 12 h after incubation with RA183 (Figure 5G,H).

h. (E) After treatment of ES2 cells with 1 μM RA183 for the
indicated times, ES2 cell lysate was subjected to Western blot analysis
and probed with antibody to PARP (top) and Bax (middle) or actin (bottom).
(F) OAW42 cells were treated with RA183 (empty) or vehicle control
(filled) for 12 h, respectively. After treatment, the cells were harvested
and incubated with the cell-permeable dye H2DCFDA. Release
of dichlorofluorescein was analyzed by flow cytometry as a measure
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). H2O2 was used
as a positive control (not shown). (G, H) SKOV3 and TOV21G cells were
treated with 1 μM b-AP15 or RA183 at 0.5 or 0.25 μM for
12 h and analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with fluorescein-labeled
annexin-V.

Inhibition of Proteasome
Function in Mice by RA183
Treatment of HEK 293 cells expressing
tetraubiquitin firefly luciferase
(4UbFL) with RA183 induced a dramatic increase in luciferase activity
(Figure 6A) consistent
with inhibition of proteasomal 4UbFL degradation (Figure 6B).

Figure 6 RA183 inhibits
proteasomal activity and tumor growth in mice. (A, B) 293TT cells
were stably transfected with 4UbFL expressing plasmid35 and treated with titrations of the indicated compounds
for 4 h. Lysates were prepared and luciferase activity was measured
(A). Data are presented as fold change in luciferase activity compared
to untreated cells. (B) Levels of Lys48-linked ubiquitin in lysates
were analyzed by Western blot. (C) Mice were administered 4UbFL DNA
to the skin via gene gun (i.d.). After 24 h, the site of DNA administration
was treated topically by application of 4% (w/v) RA183 (40 μL)
in emu oil or oil alone (10 mice/group) respectively. After the indicated
time points post-treatment, bioluminescence was measured by intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of luciferin and imaging with an IVIS 200 at the
site of DNA delivery (* p <0.05, ** p <0.01). (D) Mice were administered 4UbFL DNA to the leg muscle
(intramuscularly (i.m.)) via in vivo electroporation. RA183 was given
i.p. at 20 mg/kg. After the indicated time points post-treatment,
bioluminescence was measured in control and RA183-treated animals
(10 mice/group) by intraperitoneal injection of luciferin and imaging
with an IVIS 200 at the site of DNA delivery. (E, F) 3 × 105 ID8-Luc cells (a syngeneic mouse ovarian cell line expressing
luciferase) were injected into the peritoneal cavity of C57BL6 mice
(five per group) on day 0. The mice were initially treated daily i.p.
with either vehicle or 5 mg/kg RA183 dissolved in 2% DMSO and 25%
β-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin on days 3–17 and then RA183
dose was escalated to 10 mg/kg on days 17–24. The tumor growth
was detected by imaging the mice through IVIS system and measuring
the luciferase activity (relative light units (RLUs)) before, at the
interval, and after the treatment. (G) Nude mice were administered
ES2-luc cells i.p., and 2 days later, a basal bioluminescent level
was determined for each mouse. Nude mice bearing ES2-luciferase cells
i.p. were treated with either 6.6 mg/kg RA183 (dissolved in 2% DMSO
and 25% β-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin) (i.p.) or vehicle alone
(n = 9 per group) 6 days on and 1 day off. Prior
to and both 7 and 14 days after initiation of treatment, the mice
were imaged for their luciferase activity (RLU) and fold change over
baseline was determined.

To test for proteasome
inhibition by RA183 in vivo, we first employed biolistic delivery
of the 4UbFL reporter plasmid via gene gun to transduce the skin of
mice. After i.p. injection of luciferin, the enzymatic activity of
luciferase in the skin was visualized as bioluminescence using an
IVIS imager. At 2 h post gene gun delivery of the 4UbFL DNA, the mice
were imaged and baseline luminescence was recorded. The control group
(n = 10) of mice was treated topically at the site
of 4UbFL delivery with vehicle alone (emu oil) and another group (n = 10) was treated topically with 40 μL of RA183
(4% w/v in 5% emu oil) (Figure 6C). At 4, 18, and 42 h post-treatment, the mice were imaged
and luminescence was quantified; RA183 treatment was associated with
4UbFL stabilization at 4 and 18 h, but returned to near baseline by
42 h (Figure 6C). In
a similar experiment, the 4UbFL reporter DNA construct was delivered
i.m. by in vivo electroporation, and we chose to administer RA183
i.p. because recent clinical data36 suggest
that this is more effective than i.v. administration of proteasome
inhibitor for the treatment of ovarian cancer (Figure 6D). One day after electroporation i.m. with
the 4UbFL reporter, the mice were imaged to obtain baseline bioluminescence.
One dose of RA183 (20 mg/kg in 25% β-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin
in water) was administered i.p., and the mice were imaged again at
4 and 24 h to determine the luciferase activity. RA183 caused a rapid
increase in bioluminescence, which was sustained for >24 h.

In Vitro
Microsomal Stability and Metabolite
Identification of RA183
In our previous study,22 RA190 was detected in the plasma of mice 1 h
after i.p. injection, and it exhibited an initial half-life of ∼4
h. In contrast, upon i.p. administration, no RA183 was detected in
plasma at 1 h, suggesting that it is degraded rapidly in vivo, possibly
by the liver. Indeed, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH)-dependent metabolism was observed when RA183 and RA190 were
incubated with human liver microsomes. Most RA183 (∼93%) was
converted to metabolites after 1 h incubation with human microsomes,
whereas RA190 was more stable such that only ∼41% was converted
to metabolites in 1 h (Figure S6). One
major metabolite of RA183 was observed with loss of mass that is consistent
with the RA183 structure (Figure S7). The
proposed metabolite structure was confirmed by chemical synthesis
as the active compound RA9.3,27 Since ovarian cancer
is routinely treated with i.p. chemotherapy, and this potentially
enhances the tumor dosing while limiting systemic toxicity,36 we elected to proceed with i.p. administration
for studies to assess the antitumor activity of RA183 in mouse models
of ovarian cancer.

Tumor Therapy
with RA183
We first examined in immunocompetent mice the
therapeutic effect of RA183 against the syngeneic murine ovarian tumor
model ID8-luc expressing luciferase.24,37 C57BL6 mice
were challenged i.p. with ID8-luc tumor as this is the site through
which ovarian cancer primarily develops and spreads. Treatment was
initiated 3 days later. The mice were administered i.p. either 6.6
mg/kg RA183 in 25% β-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin in water or
vehicle alone for 12 days daily and tumor growth was measured using
bioluminescent imaging. On day 17, the RA183-treated mice showed a
significantly lower tumor burden (Figure 6E,F). The dosing was increased to 10 mg/(kg
day) RA183 for 5 more days and on day 24, the tumor burden had not
increased further, whereas the control mice demonstrated continued
tumor growth.

Nude mice were inoculated i.p. with human ES2-luc
ovarian clear cell carcinoma cells. After 4 days, treatment i.p. with
vehicle alone or 6.6 mg/kg RA183 daily was initiated for 12 days.
Bioluminescent imaging on days 7, 10, and 13 indicated that treatment
with RA183 significantly reduced ES2 xenograft tumor burden compared
to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6G).

Studies indicating an important biological
role for RPN13 in ovarian and other cancers and resistance to cisplatin
treatment,38,39 as well as the preclinical antitumor
activity
of RA183 and RA190 indicate the promise for this approach to treat
ovarian and TNBC in addition to MM.25 Our
data provide information about the pharmacophore of the α,β-unsaturated
carbonyls of this series of bischalcones and the influence of the
side chains upon metabolism and specificity for RPN13, with which
to further improve their druglike properties.

Methods
Cell Lines
and
Viability Assays
All cell lines were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in specified medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and
100 μg/mL streptomycin at 5% CO2. OV2008, HeLa, SiHa,
ME180, HT3, and C33A were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium-, OVCAR3-, CaSki-, ES2-, TOV21G-, NCI-H929-, MM.1S-, RPMI-8226-,
U266-, ANBL6-, and Bortezomib-resistant lines in RPMI-1640, and SKOV3
and HCT116 cell lines in McCoy’s 5A medium. Cell viability
was assayed using CellTiter 96 AQ ueous One Solution Reagent
(Promega, Madison, WI). Cells seeded at a concentration of 1000 cells/well
for HeLa, 5000 cells/well for ES2 and HCT116, 3000 cells/well for
ovarian cancer lines, and 10 000–20 000 cells/well
for other cell lines in 100 μL medium in 96-well plate were
treated with compounds at specified concentrations. After the indicated
periods, the cells were incubated according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide labeling mixture (Sigma) for 1–2 h and absorbance at
570 nm was measured using a Benchmark Plus microplate spectrophotometer
(Bio-Rad).

Antibodies and Western
Blot Analysis
Total cellular protein (10–20 μg)
from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes,
and analyzed by Western blot. Antibodies
for Western Blot analysis were obtained by the following commercial
sources: anti-p21(WAF1), Bax (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA), antiubiquitin (SC8017), anti-IkB-α (C-15), anti-ATF-4 (SC-200)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PARP (BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, California), (Stressgen Corp., Victoria, BC, Canada), antitubulin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), anti-actin, anti-ADRM1 (anti-RPN13) (Sigma-Aldrich),
antiubiquitin, Lys48 (05-1307) (Millipore), streptavidin Dynabeads
(Invitrogen), HRP–streptavidin (Invitrogen), peroxidase-linked
antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), and antirabbit IgG (GE Healthcare
U.K. Ltd., U.K.) and utilized at the concentration recommended by
the manufacturer.

Flow Cytometry
Induction of apoptosis
was determined using annexin V-PE Apoptosis
Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were resuspended
in binding buffer and 5 μL of annexin V-PE and 5 μL of
7-AAD were then added into the cells, which were then incubated at
room temperature for 15 min and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Active
caspase-3 was measured using PE-Active Caspase-3 antibody (550821)
and 1× BD Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation buffer (51-6896 kc) (BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
flow cytometry. To assay ROS, 2 × 105 cells were added
to a six-well plate the day before use. After treatment and incubation,
the plates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
the cells were harvested with trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid. The cells were subsequently washed again with PBS and then suspended
in 1 mL of PBS. The cells were incubated with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA; 1 μM) in a CO2 incubator
at 37 °C for 60 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS
and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Biotin
Labeling Assay
19S purified proteasome (R&D Systems,
Cat. No. E-366) (500 ng) in 19S buffer (20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 15% glycerol) was incubated with compounds (20 μM) for
a period of 30 min at room temperature, mixed with an equal volume
of Laemmli sample buffer (20 μL) (Bio-Rad), and boiled for 5
min. The total sample was mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample
buffer (20 μL) (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 5 min. The proteins
were separated using a 4–15% Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN SDS-PAGE
gel (1 h at 100 V) and transferred to PVDF membrane overnight at 4
°C (24 V). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
in PBST for 1 h at room temperature and washed for 20 min (3×
with PBST). Then, the membrane was probed with HRP–streptavidin
(1:10 000 in PBST) for a period of 1 h at room temperature
and washed for 30 min (3× with PBST) and developed using HyGLO
chemiluminescent detection reagent (Denville) for biotin recognition.

Recombinant RPN13 Preparation
Human RPN13 full-length, Pru
domain, DEUBAD domain, RPN2 (940–953),
and His-tagged UCH37 were prepared as described previously.30,31,40

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed at 25
°C on Bruker AVANCE 700, 800, or 850 MHz spectrometers equipped
with cryogenically cooled probes. Processing was performed in NMRPipe,41 and the resulting spectra were visualized with
XEASY.42 Protein concentrations were calculated
by extinction coefficients based on amino acid composition and absorbance
at 280 nm for protein dissolved in 6 M guanidine–HCl. Buffer
A (20 mM NaPO4, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.1% NaN3, 5% D2O pH 6.5) was used for all NMR samples except those
containing RA183 or b-AP15, which were performed in buffer B (buffer
A with no DTT present). For all NMR samples, 10-fold molar excess
RA183 or b-AP15 (5 mM stock in DMSO) was preincubated with RPN13 protein
at 4 °C overnight and unreacted or labile RA183 or b-AP15 was
removed by extensive dialysis against buffer C (20 mM NaPO4, 50 mM NaCl, pH 6.5).

LC–MS
Analysis of RA183 Adducts
Human RPN13 full-length, Pru domain,
DEUBAD domain, RPN2 (940–953), or His-UCH37 was dialyzed extensively
against buffer C to remove DTT. Complexes of RPN13 full-length:RPN2
(940–953) or RPN13 Pru:RPN2 (940–953) were formed by
incubating sample mixtures on ice for >1 h. Next, 20 or 50 μM
RA183 (5 mM stock in DMSO) was added to 100 μL of 2 μM
target sample and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h while rotating. After
2 h, the samples were immediately analyzed by LC–MS without
any dialysis. For LC–MS analysis, acetonitrile was added to
RA183-treated proteins to a final concentration of 10%. LC–MS
was performed on either an Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa
Clara, CA) 6100 Series Quadrupole LC/MS System or 6520 Accurate-Mass
Q-TOF LC/MS System, each equipped with an electrospray source, operated
in the positive-ion mode. Data acquisition and analysis were performed
by OpenLAB CDS ChemStation Edition C.01.05 or MassHunter Workstation
(version B.06.01). For data analysis and deconvolution of accurate
mass spectra, MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (version B.07.00)
with BioConfirm Workflow was used.

RPN13 Pru–RA183
Complex Calculation
RPN13 Pru–RA183
complexes were generated by using High Ambiguity Driven protein–protein
DOCKing (HADDOCK) 2.243 in combination
with CNS44 via a method described previously.22 The atomic coordinates for human RPN13 Pru domain
were obtained from PDB 5IRS.45 Four distance restraints
were defined between C88 Sγ of RPN13 and four atoms of RA183
to recapitulate the sulfur–carbon bond; HADDOCK requires two
distinct molecules for docking. 1H,15N HSQC
experiments were recorded on 15N-labeled RPN13 Pru without/with
RA183. The ratio of peak intensity values (Δ) was plotted for
each RPN13 backbone and side-chain (Figure 2D) amide group according to eq 1, in which I represents
peak intensity and 0.65 is a scaling factor derived by setting the
randomly coiled N- and C-terminal ends of RPN13 Pru domain as unaffected
by RA183. 1  RPN13
Pru residues with Δ values greater than 1 standard deviation
(SD) above average (Figure 2D), and >40% accessibility were defined as “active”
and their neighbors as “passive” with the exception
of M31, V93, V95, F106, and W108. The accessibility of these amino
acids is <40%; however, their side chains are located in the binding
surface and these residues were therefore also defined as active.
Ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) were imposed to restrict hRPN13
Pru active residues to be within 2.0 Å of any RA183 atom.43 A total of 1000 structures were subjected to
rigid-body energy minimization, and 250 lowest-energy structures were
chosen for semiflexible simulated annealing in torsion angle space,
followed by refinement in explicit water. During semiflexible simulated
annealing, atoms at the interface were allowed to move, but constrained
by the AIRs and unambiguous distance constraints defining the sulfur–carbon
bond. After water refinement, 250 RPN13 Pru–RA183 structures
were sorted into three clusters by using a 1.5 Å cutoff criterion
on the root-mean-square deviation of RA183. The lowest-energy structure
of each cluster was energy-minimized by Schrödinger after explicit
introduction of a covalent bond between RPN13 C88 Sγ and the
RA183 reacted carbon.

Mapping the
RPN13 Pru Domain Surface That Interacts with b-AP15
1H,15N HSQC experiments were recorded on 15N-labeled RPN13 Pru without/with b-AP15. The ratio of peak intensity
values (Δ) were calculated for each RPN13 Pru domain backbone
amide group, according to eq 2, in which I represents peak intensity and
0.259 is a scaling factor to adjust for reduced protein concentration
in the RPN13 Pru–b-AP15 sample; this value was derived by setting
the randomly coiled N- and C-terminal ends of RPN13 Pru domain as
unaffected by b-AP15. 2  RPN13 Pru residues
with Δ values greater than 1 SD value above average were mapped
onto an RPN13 Pru domain ribbon diagram with a red gradient by using
PyMOL software.

Immunoprecipitation
Assay
SKOV3 cells (5 × 107 cells) were lysed
in 2 mL of M-PER buffer, and lysate was cleared using a tabletop centrifuge
(2 min, 13 000 rpm). The collected supernatant was precleared
with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (100 μL) (Invitrogen,
Cat. No. 65601) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were removed by magnet,
and the supernatant was either treated with RA183B (1 μM) or
untreated for 45 min at 4 °C. Lysate was denatured using SDS
(1% final concentration) at 70 °C for 5 min and diluted 10-fold.
Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (200 μL) were added to
both samples and incubated at 4 °C overnight with continuous
gentle rotation. The beads were separated using a magnet and washed
with M-PER (200 μL, 3×). The supernatant was saved for
Western blotting. The collected beads were eluted by heating at 70
°C for 10 min with 25 μL of M-PER and 25 μL of Laemmli
buffer. The beads were removed using magnet, and the sample was separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked
with 5% milk and treated with RPN13 antibody (SAB1404889, Sigma).
The membrane was treated with HRP-linked antimouse IgG secondary antibody
and developed using chemiluminesence reagent.

siRNA Knockdown Studies
HeLa cells were transfected
with Dharmacon siRNA for RPN13 (L-012340-01-0005) (50 nM) or nonspecific
control (D-001810-10-05) for 48 h. The cells were lysed and subjected
to the labeling experiment similar to the previous experiments.

Luciferase Assay
Subconfluent
cultures of cells were transfected with 4UbFL or FL plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The
cells were seeded at 10 000 cells/well in a 96-well plate 48
h post-transfection and incubated with compounds or vehicle (DMSO)
at the doses or time indicated for individual experiments. Luciferase
activity in cell lysate was determined with a Luciferase Assay Kit
(Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Bioluminescence was measured by using a GloMax-Multi Detection System
(Promega, Madison, WI).

Microsomal
Stability and Metabolite Assays
Human and mouse liver microsomes
and the NADPH regenerating systems were used to characterize the stability
and metabolism of RA183 that were purchased from Corning Life Sciences
(Tewksbury, MA) and BD Gentest Products and Services (Woburn, MA).
RA183 and its proposed metabolite were synthesized at Johns Hopkins
University and verified by NMR and mass spectrometry analysis.

Quantitative
PCR To Measure mRNA Levels
Total RNA was isolated from cells
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Extracted RNA was normalized for concentration and reverse-transcribed
using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). CHOP10 expression levels
were measured by TaqMan Gene Expression Assays with TaqMan Gene Expression
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and run with the standard thermal
cycling protocol. Spliced XBP1 mRNA was assayed with
SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) following the protocol for the
iCycler System. Forward and reverse primers were 5′-TGCTGAGTCCGCAGCAGGTG
and 5′-TGGGTCCAAGTTGTCCAGAATGCC, respectively. Calculations
were done according to the Livak method46 and normalized to reference gene GAPDH. Each condition was replicated
three times, and each sample was run in triplicate.

In Vivo DNA
Delivery, Imaging, and Treatment
All animal procedures were
performed according to approved protocols
and in accordance with the recommendations for the proper use and
care of laboratory animals. Nude, C57BL/6, Balb/c female mice (4–6
weeks old) were purchased from the NCI-Frederick Animal Production
Area (Frederick, MD). Gene gun particle-mediated DNA delivery was
performed using a helium-driven gene gun (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA),
as described previously.47 For electroporation,
a patch of the mouse leg was shaved and 10 μg of 4UbFL or FL
DNA plasmid in 20 μL of PBS was injected into the quadriceps
femoralis muscle, followed immediately by injection of the 2 Needle
Array to 5 mm depth encompassing the injection site and square-wave
electroporation (ElectroSquarePorator 833, BTX-2 Needle Array 5 mm
gap, Harvard Apparatus) delivered as eight pulses at 106 V for 20
ms with 200 ms intervals. Two hours after gene gun delivery of the
plasmid or 1 day post-electroporation, the mice were injected with
luciferin (0.3 mg in 100 μL of water i.p.) and anesthetized
with isoflurane, and optical imaging was performed for basal level
luciferase expression. Images were acquired for 10 min with a Xenogen
IVIS 200 (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA). Equally sized areas were analyzed
using Living Image 2.20 software. The mice were again imaged at 4
and 24 h post-treatment.

Tumor Treatment
Studies
Nude mice (eight per group) were inoculated with
1 × 106 ES2-Luc cells i.p. in 100 μL of PBS.
On day 3, the mice were imaged for basal level luminescence expression.
The mice were randomized into two groups, treated daily i.p. with
RA183 (6.6 mg/kg) or vehicle, and imaged again on days 7 and 14. Results
are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). ID8-Luc cells
(3 × 105) were injected into the peritoneal cavity
of C57BL6 mice (n = 5 per group) on day 0. The tumor
growth was detected by monitoring luciferase activity after injection
of luciferin. The mice were treated daily with either vehicle alone
or RA183 (5 mg/kg) on days 3–17. The daily RA183 dose was increased
to 10 mg/kg on days 18–24. The mice were imaged on days 3,
10, 17, and 24 for their luciferase activity.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance of differences
was assessed by two-tailed Student’s t using
Prism (v.5 GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and Excel. The level of significance
was set at p ≤ 0.05.
