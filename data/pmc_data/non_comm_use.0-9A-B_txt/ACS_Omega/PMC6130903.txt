The plant xylem is a preferred niche
for some important bacterial
phytopathogens, some of them encoding expansin proteins, which bind
plant cell walls. Yet, the identity of the substrate for bacterial
expansins within the plant cell wall and the nature of its interaction
with it are poorly known. Here, we determined the localization of
two bacterial expansins with differing isoelectric points (and with
differing binding patterns to cell wall extracts) on plant tissue
through in vitro fluorophore labeling and confocal imaging. Differential
localization was observed, in which Exl1 from Pectobacterium
carotovorum located into the intercellular spaces
between xylem vessels and adjacent cells of the plant xylem, whereas
EXLX1 from Bacillus subtilis bound
cell walls of most cell types. In isolated vascular tissue, however,
both PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 preferentially
bound to tracheary elements over the xylem fibers, even though both
are composed of secondary cell walls. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy,
employed to analyze the interaction of expansins with isolated xylem,
indicates that binding is governed by more than one factor, which
could include interaction with more than one type of polymer in the
fibers, such as cellulose and hemicellulose or pectin. Binding to
different polysaccharides could explain the observed reduction of
cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities in the presence of expansin,
possibly because of competition for the substrate. Our findings are
relevant for the comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis by P. carotovorum during xylem invasion, a process in
which Exl1 might be involved.

Introduction
The biological function
of bacterial expansins is currently unknown.
Expansins are small proteins with plant cell wall loosening activity
encoded by plants and some plant-associated microorganisms; however,
the activity of prokaryotic expansins can be up to 10-fold weaker
than that of plant expansins in tissue extension assays (a parameter
known as creep).1,2 In plants,
α-expansin activity targets xyloglucan–cellulose junctions,
allowing the growing tissue to expand under the turgor pressure of
the cells in eudicots;3,4 meanwhile, β-expansins from
pollen (group 1 pollen allergens) solubilize polysaccharides from
cell walls of monocots, studied principally in grasses.5,6 The role of fungal and bacterial expansins is less clear, but the
presence of expansin genes in some plant-symbiont and plant-pathogenic
microorganisms suggests a role in their interaction with plant hosts.7

Relaxation of the plant cell wall and matrix
solubilization by
expansins is achieved by a biophysical mechanism in which noncovalent
bonds that link cellulose and hemicellulose are disrupted, resulting
in slippage of the cellulose microfibrils or release of polysaccharides
from the insoluble material.1,5,8 Structural analyzes and mutagenesis experiments on Bacillus subtilis expansin EXLX1 (BsEXLX1) and its interaction with Arabidopsis thaliana cell walls indicate a model of expansin activity where three aromatic
residues in domain 2 mediate binding through a planar surface to cellulose
microdomains with higher than average concentration of xyloglucan
hemicellulose.4,9 Cell wall extension activity requires
polar residues on domain 1 (particularly Asp82 in BsEXLX1).9,10 Bacterial expansins also contain several
charged residues on the surface that affect their interaction with
cell walls of different plant species.10,11Figure S1 shows that BsEXLX1
is highly positively charged and readily binds whole cell walls, whereas PcEXL1 from Pectobacterium carotovorum (the etiologic agent of soft rot in several vegetable crops) is
predominantly negatively charged and is unable to bind to the same
structures.10,11 Furthermore, after depleting
proteins, pectin, and hemicellulose from cell walls, PcExl1 increases its binding to the cellulose-enriched preparations,
in contrast to BsEXLX1 that binds preferentially
to whole cell walls, suggesting that a substrate enriched in cellulose
could be the main target of PcExl1 in the cell wall.9,10 However, the functional reasons for these differences still need
to be determined. Besides cellulose, BsEXLX1 also
avidly binds peptidoglycan, as expected because of its basic isoelectric
point, although the significance of this observation is still unknown.12

Phytopathogenic bacteria encoding expansins,
for example, Pectobacterium, Xanthomonas, Clavibacter, Ralstonia, and Xylella (all of which are sources
of important economic losses), inhabit the plant xylem.12−15 Xylem is composed of four cell types: xylem vessels and tracheids,
which are collectively called tracheary elements (TEs), xylem fibers
(XFs) and xylem parenchyma. TE cells die by programmed cell death
leaving hollow conduits with supportive secondary cell wall thickenings
that are composed of distinctive ring and helical structures; XFs
also differentiate and undergo programmed cell death to provide structural
rigidity by also depositing secondary walls. Parenchyma cells are
the only cell type with active metabolism in the xylem.16,17 Tracheary conduits form the niche for some expansin-encoding bacteria
to thrive despite its low nutrient abundance and oxidative environment.18 Once in the xylem, bacteria spread throughout
the plant, and depending on the species, some develop exopolysaccharide
biofilms or emboli that ultimately obstruct water transport though
the conduits leading to wilting, whereas others degrade the plant
tissue by expressing a battery of pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzymes.15,18 Although expansin molecular function in bacteria is still unknown,
evidence of deletion mutants indicates a role for interaction or infection
of the plant host: EXLX1 from B. subtilis is required for proper colonization of maize roots;12 CelA, a plasmid-encoded protein in Clavibacter
michiganensis requires its expansin domain for wilt
development in tomato;19,20 and finally, expansin mutants
of Ralstonia solanacearum and on the
genome-encoded expansin from C. michiganensis show opposite effects on tomato wilting, in which the mutant has
less severe symptoms than the wild-type Ralstonia strain, whereas mutant C. michiganensis produced faster necrosis at longer distances from the inoculation
site in comparison to wild-type cells.21 These studies point to the importance of expansins for host infection,
but addressing the biochemical function or identifying the possible
site of action of expansins is still required.

Despite available
information on the biochemistry and substrate
affinity of expansin BsEXLX1,4,9,12,22 scant information
exists regarding the interaction of expansins from other microorganisms
with plant cell walls. Furthermore, the existing idea of bacterial
expansins as enhancers of cellulase activity for improving tissue
invasion is yet to be confirmed, and in fact, contradictory results
indicate that bacterial expansins not only fail to enhance cellulase
activity (reviewed in Martinez-Anaya, 2016) but also they might actually
decrease it.13,24 Here, we investigated the tissue
localization of expansin P. carotovorum EXL1 in both, whole plant tissue and isolated vascular tissue from
plants susceptible to infection with P. carotovorum, and compared it to B. subtilis EXLX1
localization. Additionally, we analyzed the interaction of PcExl1 with TEs and XFs by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
(FCS), with the aim of determining the binding properties of PcExl1 to these substrates.

Results
Fluorophore-Labeled
PcExl1 Localizes to the Plant Xylem
We previously reported
that expansins from P. carotovorum (PcExl1) and B. subtilis (BsEXLX1) have different isoelectric points, resulting
in acidic (pI < 5) and basic proteins (pI > 9), respectively,
at
pH 7.5 (Figure S1).10 This difference explains variation in their binding to
isolated plant cell walls: PcExl1 binds to cellulose
with a low content of pectin and hemicellulose, whereas BsEXLX1 has affinity for cell walls with greater content of the same
two components.10 We aimed to determine
the binding site for these expansins in the plant tissue; thus, we
incubated cross sections of celery petioles with fluorophore-labeled PcExl1-Cy3 or BsEXLX1-Cy3 or BsEXLX1-Alexa 488 and observed their localization through confocal
microscopy. As fluorophores conjugate with lysine residues, we first
determined in silico that binding sites involved in expansin interaction
with the substrate should not be affected (e.g., increased, given
the ring structure of the fluorophores) by fluorophore conjugation
of nearby lysine residues, which we subsequently confirmed through
comparative binding studies of Cy5-labelled and nonlabeled PcExl1 to Avicel and vascular tissue in pull down assays
(Figure S2). BsEXLX1 bound
to cell walls of most cell types, including both xylem and phloem,
and to cambium cells, and appeared less abundant in metaxylem cells,
in agreement with previous reports9 (Figures 1a and S3). In contrast, PcExl1 showed
a strong localization to xylem and a very faint signal was detected
in cambium and phloem cells (Figure 1b). In the broccoli inflorescence stalk, PcExl1 also localized to the xylem, whereas BsEXLX1
showed less specific binding (Figure S3c,d). The PcExl1 signal of the xylem vessels appeared
as punctate in most cases (Figures 1b–d; and S3), in
numbers of dots that seem to correspond to the number of surrounding
cells (which could be easily counted in pictures of tissue stained
with BsEXLX1, Figure 1); indeed, a closer examination of xylem vessels showed PcExl1 localization on the intercellular spaces of the vessels
and the surrounding cells. In cross sections, xylem conduits appear
circular but they consist of pitted and helical structures along the
stalk that we sometimes found protruding from the tissue, which were
also stained by PcExl1 (Figure S4). To confirm that the area in which PcExl1
localizes corresponds to the xylem, we used toluidine blue, which
stains the primary cell wall pink and the secondary cell wall blue
by binding to lignin. Indeed, the areas labeled by PcExl1 of both celery and broccoli were positive for secondary cell
wall staining (Figure S5); longitudinal
sections of tissue confirmed that PcExl1 specifically
binds to the xylem vessels (Figure S6).

Figure 1 PcExl1 binds specifically to the xylem of celery
in comparison to BsEXLX1. Confocal images of a cross

results of at least three independent labeled-protein preparations.
Scale bars: 200 μm in (a) and (b); 50 μm in (c); and 20
μm in (d).

Treatment of isolated
cell walls to sequentially remove proteins,
pectin, and hemicellulose results in an increase in binding of PcExl1 and a decrease in binding of BsEXLX1.9,10 Thus, we visualized the localization of PcExl1
and BsEXLX1 incubated simultaneously before and after
an equivalent sequential extraction of soluble proteins, pectin, and
hemicellulose removal in tissue samples. Untreated celery tissue showed
that BsEXLX1 localizes to primary and secondary cell
walls, whereas PcExl1 again was predominantly found
on the secondary cell wall of the xylem (Figure 2a). Protein depletion caused loss of tissue
structure resulting in dispersion of the xylem vessels into a greater
area within the celery cross section; therefore, the PcExl1 signal appears more disperse in the form of rings and dots (possibly
corresponding to the signal of cell corners around overlapping conduits
at different focal planes), whereas BsEXLXs also
appeared dispersed, but in a different patter that excluded the conduits
edges (Figure 2b).
After proteins and pectin removal, the tissue disaggregated leaving
xylem components that remained glued together and were bound by PcExl1 and also by BsEXLX1 (Figure 2c); finally, subsequent hemicellulose
depletion provoked separation of the xylem helical bundles to which BsEXLX1 increased binding, whereas PcExl1
kept showing strong signal, resulting in a greater degree of colocalization
(Figure 2d). Altogether
these results indicate that as determined with isolated cell walls, PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 bind preferentially
to different structures in the intact plant tissue, but once pectin
and hemicellulose are removed, both expansins bind to the remaining
fraction composed of secondary cell wall.

hemicellulose with 1 M NaCl, 50 mM CDTA, and 4 M NaOH (d), and incubated
simultaneously with BsEXLX1-Alexa 488 and PcExl1-Cy3. Ph: phloem; Par: parenchyma; MX: metaxylem;

with ImageJ software using the Z projection tool
at maximum intensity for fluorescence and average intensity for bright
field. Pictures are representative results of at least two independent
labeled-protein preparations with different fluorophores.

Fluorophore-Labeled PcExl1 Binds TE but Not
XF
Because PcExl1 binds to the xylem vessels,
we then analyzed its
localization among the xylem components using isolated vascular tissue
(strings) from different vegetable species: celery, kale, beetroot,
and Swiss chard, which are susceptible to infection (determined by
tissue maceration or wilting in the case of Swiss chard) by P. carotovorum strain BF20 in 48 h (strain BF20 was
called 101 in ref (10)). These strings were treated with an adapted protocol using a gentle
treatment with alkali and hypochlorite that have been used to isolate
the TEs from celery,25 which partially
depleted lignin, and a second method using acetic acid and sodium
chlorite, which removed lignin almost completely, as determined by
a decrease in fluorescence either with ethidium bromide staining or
by autofluorescence at 405 nm (Figure S7). In comparison to a bright ethidium bromide signal that we observed
as lineal fibers, autofluorescence revealed mainly the xylem vessels
of the sample before treatment, but fluorescence decreased after partial
lignin removal, and only the background was visible after complete
lignin removal in both cases (Figure S7). Preparations of vascular tissue after lignin depletion comprised
TEs (including vessels and tracheids) and XFs. In the vasculature,
partially depletion of lignin, xylem vessels stained brightly after
incubation with either fluorophore-labelled PcExl1-Cy5
or BsEXLX1-Cy5 (Figure 3a,c) but tracheids (that were less abundant
in our samples) were also stained (Figure S8, celery and kale). In contrast, very faint or no signal was observed
on the XFs despite their abundance in the samples, and in some cases,
expansin binding was only revealed by increasing the detector gain
of the confocal microscope. This pattern was observed independently
of the plant species, including rhubarb (which did not show infection
symptoms up to 72 h post-inoculation and therefore was considered
as an infection-resistant species), which demonstrates the intrinsic
ability of expansins to bind xylem independently of the infective
capacity of P. carotovorum (Figure S8). Complete lignin depletion resulted
in a slightly greater number of visible XFs, and this was especially
evident with BsEXLX1 in comparison to PcExl1 (Figures 3b and 2d). Also, we determined that expansin binding to
the helical xylem is quite specific because the staining pattern was
maintained even after reducing possible nonspecific interactions by
blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA) prior to expansin incubation
(Figure S9). Altogether, these results
indicate that expansins preferentially bind to TEs in comparison to
XFs and that binding to XFs are somewhat inhibited by the presence
of lignin.

Figure 3 Expansins PcExl1 and BsEXLX1
preferentially bind TEs over XFs in isolated vascular tissue. Proteins: PcExl1 (a,b) and BsEXLX1 (c,d) were labeled
with fluorophore Cy5 and then incubated with isolated vascular tissue
from Swiss chard. When the tissue was treated to partially remove
lignin (a,c) only the TEs are visible, but the signal appears on the
XF fraction of completely delignified tissue (b,d), especially when
incubated with BsEXLX1 (arrows). Images were reconstructed
from multiple stacks with ImageJ software using the Z projection tool at maximum intensity for fluorescence and average
intensity for bright field. The scale bar is 100 μm. Pictures
are representative results of at least four independent labeled-protein
preparations.

TEs and XFs deposit secondary
cell walls with high cellulose content17 to which expansins have affinity; therefore,
we investigated why PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 show a preference for TEs over XFs. We reasoned that it could
be due to sugar composition, cellulose accessibility, cellulose crystallinity,
fiber structure, or a combination of some of these characteristics.
First, we obtained separate preparations of partially delignified
TEs and XFs from Swiss chard (because of their facility to be manipulated
under the microscope among the fibers from the different vegetables)
and quantified their sugar composition after hydrolysis with diluted
sulfuric acid. TE and XF hydrolysis yielded approximately 30 and 35%
of sugars, respectively, with glucose as their main component (85%).
Xylose was slightly more abundant in the TEs, whereas the concentration
of arabinose and galactose (and probably other sugars such as mannose)
was twofold higher in XFs compared to that in TEs (Table 1); xylose and arabinose are
likely derived from hemicellulose, whereas galactose and mannose could
come from pectin because these sugars are scarce in hemicellulose
from secondary cell walls.26 The proportions
and composition of sugars are similar to those determined for celery.25

PcExl1 Inhibits
the Hydrolysis of Polysaccharides from the Plant
Vasculature
To learn about the nature of these substrates
(isolated TEs and XFs), we analyzed their susceptibility to degradative
enzymes (using commercial cellulase and xylanase preparations). Treatment
of TEs with fungal cellulase for 2 h yielded 3.5-fold more reducing
sugars (RSs) compared to those released by digestion of XFs (Figure 4a,b, black bars).
It has been suggested that expansin enhances cellulase activity; thus,
we added PcExl1 to the reaction. Interestingly, we
found a decrease of the amount of RSs released (Figure 4a,b, gray bars). These results imply that
more accessible cellulose exists in TEs and that PcExl1 might be competing for binding sites with the cellulases as
previously reported.13,24 X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine
the cellulose crystallinity index (CI) in TEs and XFs resulted in
40% CI for the XFs against 35% for TEs (although analyzes of nine
determinations showed that this difference is not statistically significant).
On the other hand, texture analysis (degree of preferred orientation,
measured as the fwhm of the fitted curve) yielded differences between
TEs and XFs, with full width at half-maximum (fwhm) values of 83 and
54, respectively (Figure 4e,f). These results suggest that the intrinsic arrangement
of cellulose fibers within these two elements is different, with the
arrangement in XFs being more tightly packed and preferentially oriented
along the axis of the fiber than that of the cellulose fibers within
the TEs.

Figure 4 TEs and XFs differ in digestibility and texture; and PcExl1 affects enzyme activity. Isolated TEs (a,c) and XFs (b,d) from
Swiss chard were incubated with 1 U cellulase (a,b; black bars) to
determine their accessibility by the production of RS. Another set
of reactions included 8.8 mM PcExl1 (a,b; light gray
bars). Results are the average and standard deviation (SD) of three
biological experiments by triplicate. (e,f): CI and texture were determined
by XRD of isolated TEs and XFs. Results are the average and SD of
nine independent measurements with three independent replicate samples.
Asterisks indicate statistical significance at p <
0.01 confidence, evaluated through a paired t-test.

Given that xylem elements contain
hemicellulose, we analyzed the
effect of a fungal endoxylanase. This treatment also resulted in an
increased level of RSs (1.7-fold) from TEs in comparison to that of
XFs after digestion for 120 min (Figure 4c,d), where reactions did not reach a maximum
of RS release from TEs, whereas they did for XFs (Figure 4c,d). This result agrees with
the xylose levels contained in each type of fiber (10.5% vs 7.3%; Table 1). Again, the addition
of PcExl1 to the reaction obstructed the action of
the endoxylanase, suggesting binding to hemicellulose also.

Binding
of PcExl1 to Xylem Components Is Multifactorial
We characterized
the interaction of PcExl1 with
TEs and XFs in more detail by FCS, to analyze the kinetics of PcExl1 diffusing and/or interacting with the substrates.27 With FCS, we compared the mobility of Cy5-labelled PcExl1 in solution (in the absence of substrate) and in
the presence of TEs or XFs. The autocorrelation function of Cy5 and
Cy5-PcExl1 in solution has a single component each
and was well fitted by a model of 3D diffusion, with DCy5 = 250 ± 1.3 μm2 s–1 and DCy5-PcExl1 = 136 ± 2.4 μm2 s–1 (mean
± standard error), respectively (Figure S10). We assume that binding of Cy5-PcExl1 to xylem
components would reduce its mobility, which might be reflected in
a decay of their corresponding autocorrelation function curves. We
performed FCS experiments at two distinct sampling frequencies (50
vs 500 kHz) (Figure 5a,b). Isolated XFs or TEs were incubated with diluted PcExl1-Cy5 for 48 h (to ensure that chemical equilibrium was achieved). Figure 5 shows the ensemble
average of the autocorrelation function for Cy5-PcExl1 in solution, interacting with isolated XFs, or with isolated
TEs (see Figure S11 for single point FCS
experiments). Within the same experimental samples, the amplitude
of G(0) for Cy5-PcExl1
interacting with either XFs or TEs was higher than that for free Cy5-PcExl1, which might erroneously indicate a chemical equilibrium
shifted for free PcExl1 (the number of mobile Cy5-PcExl1 molecules is inversely proportional to G(0); Figure S11). However,
such concentration differences mainly reflect the relative abundance
of mobile species, which are a minor fraction of Cy5-PcExl1 determined by pull down analysis (not shown) with a major contribution
of immobilized Cy5-PcExl1. A more reliable estimation
of the abundance of bound versus free Cy5-PcExl1
can be obtained from the histograms of photon counts of the corresponding
point FCS measurements (Figure 5c,d). Under this experimental regime, we found that Cy5-PcEx1 was more abundant on free solution (outside) than
within XFs (inside), as the number of photon counts was higher for
free Cy5-PcExl (p < 0.001, t-test) (Figure 5c). In contrast, Cy5-PcEx1 was not statistically
more abundant within (inside) versus outside, in any of TEs or XEs
(p = 0.3, t-test) (Figure 5d). Interestingly, we had to
employ 10-fold greater laser power (1% vs 0.1%) for the point FCS
experiments using XFs as a substrate (Figures 5a,c and S11a),
compared to those experiments performed with the TEs (Figures 5b,d and S11b); otherwise, the Cy5-PcEx1 signal was
dominated by noise. The latter indicates that Cy5-PcEx1 binds more to TEs than to XFs, but this requires quantification.
Of note, the autocorrelation function curves of Cy5-PcExl1 calculated directly at XFs or TEs showed longer and multiple
decaying times (Figure 5a,b), indicating an important decrease in Cy5-PcExl1 mobility and more than one factor intervening on the binding
to the substrate. In any case, the interaction of Cy5-PcExl1 with the xylem components severely impinges on protein mobility,
supporting the hypothesis that PcExl1 binds to this
substrate, and at multiple binding sites.

Discussion
Here, we have determined that the site of
localization of expansin
Exl1 from P. carotovorum is the plant
xylem, specifically, the intercellular spaces between the xylem vessels
and the surrounding cells in cross sections of whole tissue preparations,
in contrast to EXLX1 from B. subtilis that localizes on the cell walls of different cell types. Also,
both expansins bind to the TEs (helical and pitted structures) in
isolated vascular tissue, which are made of secondary cell wall. Xylem
components dispersed in the disorganized tissue after the removal
of soluble proteins from cross-sectional preparations of celery petioles
allowing more signal because of binding of PcExl1,
pectin, and hemicellulose, resulted in helical structures resistant
to the treatment because of their secondary cell wall composition,
and became a better substrate for BsEXLX1 after the
removal of the competing charged components. Although more BsEXLX1 binding occurred, PcExl1 was still
more prevalent in double-staining experiments, confirming previous
observations indicating that BsEXLX1 interaction
is more important in terms of binding capacity to whole cell walls
(given the significant electrostatic component to its binding), and
in comparison, it explains the relatively little binding of PcExl1 to whole cell walls.10 One important difference we encountered by working with the vasculature
as a substrate compared to pure cellulose (such as Avicel) for expansin
binding was the low expansin recovery after incubation and boiling
in the sample buffer, making binding quantification difficult (Figure S2). Additionally, we noticed that all
protein bands (expansins and irrelevant controls) incubated with the
vascular tissue showed a slight delayed mobility. So far, we have
no explanation for these observations.

Similar staining patterns
of isolated delignified xylem (corresponding
to structures rich in cellulose and crystalline cellulose) with fluorophore-labeled PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 could arise from binding
to cellulose through aromatic residues on domain 2, which could agree
with the reported comparable binding parameters of both expansins
to pure cellulose (such as Avicel10); however,
in our recent experiments, we have consistently found that the fraction
of bound PcExl1 to Avicel was lower with respect
to BsEXLX1 (approximately 40% bound PcExl1 vs 90% bound BsEXLX1, possibly due to a more
crystalline Avicel lot) (Figure S2), suggesting
that the strong PcExl1 binding could be due to the
presence of other substrates besides cellulose. The reason for the
strong binding of the expansins to TEs compared to XFs is puzzling,
given their similar chemical composition (Table 1). Whereas we found through XRD analysis
that the CI of TEs and XFs (partially depleted of lignin) is statistically
the same, we found significant differences in their organization,
as evidenced by the texture analysis of XRD patterns. In particular,
XFs showed a narrower spread of the diffraction pattern along the
χ angle (characterized by a smaller fwhm), which implies a more
ordered arrangement (preferential alignment) of the crystalline cellulose
fibrils within XFs than that in the TEs. This arrangement makes XFs
resemble bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) or Avicel more
and could be the reason for the low RS yield from XFs after digestion
with a cellulase mixture compared to digestion of the TEs.

Wang
et al. 2013, reported that expansin BsEXLX1
binds to cell wall microdomains with higher content of xyloglucan
in Arabidopsis walls.4 However, as our fluorescence-based localization experiments
cannot discriminate among different domains on the isolated helical
structures, we were unable to discern whether the xylem structure
presents a homogeneous substrate for expansin binding. Interestingly,
the autocorrelation function curves of diluted Cy5-PcExl1 showed multiple components for the interaction either with TEs
or with XFs. The complexity of such experimental autocorrelation functions
precludes the use of a simple diffusion and binding model (such as
the one used to compute the diffusion coefficient of free Cy5-PcExl1). Instead, it points out to the existence of multiple
binding sites with differential affinities to either TEs or XFs, or
binding to different substrates (cellulose, hemicellulose, or pectin),
or different interaction types (electrostatic and hydrophobic), or
a combination of these. A more elaborate model, including both diffusion
and binding, could be used to fit the experimental autocorrelation
functions of Cy5-PcExl1 bound to either TEs or XFs.
The autocorrelation function of binding dynamics could be written
as the contribution of several species interacting with either TEs
or XFs with different binding kinetics. Further studies will be performed
to determine the factors behind this behavior.

Enzymatic hydrolysis
of the polymers, either with cellulase or
xylanase indicated differences on the accessibility of cellulose and
hemicellulose among TEs and XFs: more accessible cellulose seems to
exist in TEs that in the XFs, as the amount of reducing sugars was
threefold lower in the XF, which in comparison contained more hemicellulose
that was also released from the TEs. These results agree with the
amount and type of sugars quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and with the degree of order in the polymers determined by
crystallography. Surprisingly, we found that this enzymatic activity
was inhibited in the presence of PcExl1, which suggests
binding to competing sites containing cellulose or hemicellulose,
which could contribute to the FCS profiles observed. Indeed, we have
quantified a small concentration of soluble polysaccharides from incubations
of the vasculature of Swiss chard with expansin, resembling the activity
of maize EXPB1 on maize silk cell walls (Figure S12). Solubilized sugar concentration is quite low and variable
at the conditions used here (pH 7, 30 °C), but clearly above
that of the controls without expansin, or containing the irrelevant
proteins BSA or lysozyme. We suggest that PcExl1
could be targeting pectin associated with cellulose as UV–vis
scans of the reaction supernatants indicate soluble phenolics with
a peak at 310 nm corresponding to p-coumaric acid,
which can be found esterified to pectin in cell walls of Swiss chard,
whereas arabinoxylan (the target of ZmEXPB1) is not
abundant in the cell walls of this species, although these experiments
do not discard hemicellulose being solubilized; however, given that
cell corners are rich in pectin and were targeted by PcExl1, point
to pectin being solubilized. We are carrying out further studies to
determine the identity of this polysaccharide and the best conditions
in which solubilization occurs, as it could be an important aspect
of PcExl1 biological activity.

Lignin could
be another component of the cell wall affecting expansin
binding. We removed most lignin from the vasculature and found that
staining of the TEs was comparable with samples containing some lignin,
albeit the intensity of the fluorescence was slightly decreased. We
hypothesize that lignin removal exposes less abundant polysaccharides
(hemicellulose or pectin) in the XFs (which were brighter than TEs
with ethidium bromide staining) because more signal was observed with BsEXLX1, for which electrostatic interaction is as important
as hydrophobic binding, whereas PcExl1 showed similar
staining patterns in samples in the presence or absence of lignin.
Other reports indicate that approximately 5–10% of sugars are
solubilized by our delignifying treatment,500 and our determinations of sugar composition of the sample that approximately
15% are carbohydrates other than glucose, indicating that hemicellulose
and pectin remain in the fibers after the chemical treatment and suggests
a tight interaction of these polysaccharides with the cellulose in
both, the TEs and XFs.

Some works claim that treatment of lignocellulosic
material with
bacterial expansins facilitates the hydrolysis by digestive enzymes
such as cellulases (reviewed in refs (23) and (28)), but our results indicate the opposite; although it must
be considered that the enzymes used for synergism in our experiments
are of fungal origin and their optimal activity occurs at pH 5 and
50 °C, far from the near neutral conditions at which hydrolytic
enzymes of Pectobacterium are most
active.29 Still, most industrial conversions
use fungal enzymes in their processes; thus, the utility of bacterial
expansins in the energy industry seems limited at present.

Finally,
the specific localization of PcExl1 to
the xylem is significant because P. carotovorum is a xylem-invading bacterium.14,15 Therefore,
it would be important to determine the biological implication of such
preference in the context of plant infection. Meanwhile, our results
indicate that PcExl1 binds the isolated xylem of
vegetables sensitive or resistant to P. carotovorum infection.

Conclusions
The function of bacterial
expansin remains unknown despite the
evidence of a growing body of in vitro analyses. We have provided
evidence indicating components of the plant xylem as the possible
site of action of the expansin PcExl1 from the phytopathogen P. carotovorum. We have also identified that interaction
of PcExl1 with TEs and XFs depends on several factors
and that FCS method is a powerful tool for their identification.

Materials
and Methods
Expansin Fluorophore Labeling
Expansin-like proteins PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 were purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 transformed with
pET22 plasmids bearing the corresponding sequences as previously reported,10 except that after concentrating, PcExl1 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography in a Macro-Prep
high Q chromatography column (Bio-Rad) with 20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5
and eluted with a 0.1–0.5 M NaCl gradient. The fractions containing PcExl1 were concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris
buffer pH 7.5. The purity of the proteins was confirmed on 15% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels with 0.5%
of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, in a Stain-Free Tray in a Gel Doc EZ photodocumentation
system (Bio-Rad). Purified PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 were labeled on primary amino groups with Cy5 fluorophore and
Alexa 488 from Lumiprobe, or Cy5 using the Cy5 Protein Labeling Kit
from Jena Bioscience following the manufacturer’s indications.
Briefly, 5–10 mg of each protein was incubated for 1 h with
fluorophores dissolved in dimethylformamide, in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate
buffer at room temperature with gentle agitation; non-incorporated
fluorophores were separated from the conjugated proteins using a Sephadex
G-10 resin. Aliquots were stored at −20 °C in 20 mM phosphate
buffer pH 7.5. Theoretical calculation of the number of fluorophores
conjugated (as indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions)
indicated between 0.5 and 1 per protein molecule.

Plant Material
Preparation
Celery, broccoli, rhubarb,
beetroot, kale, and Swiss chard were purchased at the experimental
field of the Facultad de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma
del Estado de Morelos. For whole tissue expansin localization, transversal
sections of approximately 0.5 mm (hand cut with a razor blade) of
celery petioles and broccoli stalks were placed into stabilization
solution (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgSO4, pH 6.9) and
then incubated for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 100
mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature with gentle
rocking. Next, slices were washed three times (10 min each) with 100
mM PBS, and a final wash in 100 mM phosphate buffer. Vegetable vascular
tissue was extracted with the help of a cutter from lengthwise-open
petioles and placed immediately in distilled water. Xylem strands
were obtained as previously described.25 Briefly, samples were boiled for 30 min in distilled water and then
transferred to 1.25 M NaOH and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Several washes were necessary to achieve neutrality. Lignin was partially
depleted from the strands by incubation in 1 M NaClO dissolved in
250 mM acetic acid for 1 h at 37 °C and thoroughly washed with
distilled water. Complete lignin depletion was obtained by incubating
xylem strands in 1% sodium chlorite and 0.14% acetic acid at 70 °C
for 20 h.30 This material was washed several
times and stored in water at 4 °C. XFs and TEs were separated
under the microscope using a 40× objective with two insulin syringe
needles, trying to preserve their structure as best as possible. They
were collected and stored in distilled water at 4 °C.

Enzymatic
Assays
Twenty milligrams (wet weight) of
XFs and TEs was incubated at 50 °C with 1 U of either cellulase
mix from Trichoderma reesei (Sigma-Aldrich
Cat. C2730) or endoxylanase from Trichoderma longibrachiatum (Sigma-Aldrich Cat. X2629), in 500 μL of 50 mM acetate buffer,
pH 5 or pH 4.5, respectively. Equivalent reactions contained 10 μg
of PcExl1. Samples were taken every 30 min for quantification
of RSs using the DNS method31 and interpolation
from glucose and xylose standard curves.

Acid Hydrolysis and HPLC
Between 20 and 30 mg of dry-weight
XFs or TEs was dried at 45 °C in an oven for 1 h and then immediately
transferred to pressure tubes containing 10 times their weight of
72% sulfuric acid, mixed for 1 min, then incubated at 30 °C in
a water bath for 1 h, with occasional stirring. Distilled water was
added to dilute sulfuric acid to 2.5%, and reactions were autoclaved
1 h at 121 °C with conditions for sterilizing liquids. Afterward,
samples were filtered through 0.45 μm membranes and neutralized
with CaCO3 powder to pH 5–6. To remove the excess
CaCO3, samples were centrifuged 10 min in a bench microcentrifuge
at a maximum speed. Ten microliters of the hydrolysate was analyzed
by HPLC (UltimateRsPump 3000) in an Aminex HPX-87H #125014 column
at 247 psi and 85 °C. Peaks were analyzed with Chromeleon 6.9
software comparing to glucose, xylose, arabinose, and galactose standards.

XRD Analysis
Two-dimensional diffraction patterns of
TEs and XFs were collected using a D8 Davinci diffractometer (Bruker,
Billerica, MA) equipped with a sealed tube cobalt source. All analyses
of the resulting patterns were conducted using the Bruker TOPAS software.
The beam was collimated to a diameter of 0.5 mm (35 mA, 45 kV). TE
and XF samples were dropcast onto clean silicon wafer pieces and oven-dried
for the analysis. A still frame of a blank piece of silicon was initially
examined to correct for background. The background intensity was subtracted
from each sample frame prior to integration of the data. A 2θ
range of 13°–42° was used for the CI analysis. Integration
along the relative angle χ for every 2θ value was performed
to obtain one-dimensional diffraction plots of intensity versus 2θ.
The background-corrected intensity versus 2θ plots were fitted
to five symmetric Lorentzian peaks, four peaks corresponding to the
(100), (010), (002), and (040) crystalline planes,32 and one broad amorphous peak fixed at 24.1°. The CrI
was calculated by the peak deconvolution method as the ratio of the
area for the crystalline peaks over the total area for the diffraction
plots. The CrI was calculated for bacterial microcrystalline cellulose
(BMCC from the Moran-Mirabal laboratory) as a reference to validate
the deconvolution method. In addition, texture analysis was conducted
to assess the degree of preferred orientation of the cellulose fibers
within the samples. One-dimensional plots for texture analysis were
generated by performing integration along a range of 2θ values
comprising the (002) peak and plotting the resulting intensity values
versus χ. A symmetric Lorentzian peak was fitted to the plot
for each sample to determine the fwhm, which was used to assess the
degree of preferred orientation.

Confocal Microscopy
Celery or broccoli tissue was incubated
1 h at 4 °C with fluorophore-conjugated proteins PcExl1-Alexa 488 or BsEXLX1-Cy3 or in buffer only
(negative controls). Samples were placed on microscope slides, and
analysis was performed using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope
with objectives 10× and 60× S/1.3, x 4.0. Cy3 excitation
was obtained at 543 nm using DM405/488/543, and a Zeiss laser scanning
microscope LSM 510 META was attached to Zeiss Axiovert 200 M, using
a Plan Neofluar 10X/0.30 Ph1 objective. PcExL1-Alexa
488 was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser and an HFT UV 488/543/633
nm dual dichroic excitation mirror with a NFT 490 Beam Splitter and
a BP-500-530 IR emission filter for detection. BsEXLX1-Cy3 was excited at 543 nm with a He/Ne laser, with the same
dual dichroic excitation mirror and a LP 560 emission filter for detection.
The parameters were adjusted until no background fluorescence was
observed. Images were processed using LSM 510 Release Version 4.2
5P1 software (Carl Zeiss MacroImaging GmbH, R & D in collaboration
with EMBL Heidelberg, Germany). Cy5-conjugated PcExl1 and BsEXLX1 were incubated overnight at 4 °C
with isolated vascular tissue of vegetables in PBS, washed with PBS,
and placed on microscope slides. Specimens were observed with an Olympus
FV1000 microscope with an UPLSAPO 30× objective of 1.05 numerical
aperture. Excitation wavelength was 635 nm, and fluorescence emission
was collected with filters of bandwidth between 655 and 755 nm. Xylem
autofluorescence was obtained at 405 nm excitation.33 Images were processed and analyzed with Fiji software.34

Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy
For FCS measurements, we used an Olympus FV1000 microscope with
a UPLSAPO 60X S numerical aperture: 1.30 objective, and a pinhole
of 140 μm to obtain backprojected pinhole size of 344 nm for
Cy5 excitation volume (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cy5 fluorophore was
excited with a 635 nm solid-state laser line, and the filters for
the far-red emission channels had a nominal bandwidth of 655–755
nm (BA655-755; DM405\488\543\635). The average fluorescence intensity
of the sample remained constant, indicating that the fluorophore was
not significantly photobleached during the measurement. The fluorescence
intensity of the sample at the laser focus was collected as a function
of time and saved as a long data string (10 240 000
points). To perform FCS, tens of millions of measurements must be
acquired at high frequency, generally in the kilohertz to megahertz
range. The pixel sampling frequency used was 50 or 500 KHz, and each
measurement lasted <5 min. Data were collected in the pseudo-photon
counting mode. The power of the laser was set at 0.1% in the instrument
software. Because of the variation in the laser alignment from day
to day, the waist (w0) of the excitation
beam was calibrated before each day’s measurement. The beam
waist depends on the instrument setup and must be calibrated each
time the system is aligned. For this purpose, a substance with a known
concentration and diffusion coefficient (D) was used
to calibrate the excitation volume. The calibration was achieved by
measuring the autocorrelation curve of 100 nM Cy5 (in 20 mM phosphate
buffer pH 7.5) and fitted considering a diffusion rate of 250 μm2 s–1.35 The typical
values of ω0 of the FV1000 confocal microscope employed
was 0.27 μm (estimated standard error = 6.9 × 10–4; t value = 3.9 × 102; Pr (>|t|) = 0).

Data Analysis of FCS Measurements
The autocorrelation
curves of the FCS measurements were calculated by applying the normalized
autocorrelation function equation to the collected data set. The normalized
autocorrelation function of the fluorescence fluctuations is defined
as , where t refers
to the
time point of intensity acquisition and τ refers to the time
delay between acquisitions. Diffusion coefficients were extracted
from the experimental autocorrelation curves by fitting to a model
of diffusion in 3D considering transitions to the triplet state, Gtotal(τ) = Gblinking(τ)Gdiffusin(τ), using the
bound-constrained quasi-Newton method implemented using R-software
libraries.36,37 Free diffusion in three dimensions
was computed as , with , where diffusion time is τD, the radius of the focal volume is s, and
the half-length
of the observation volume is u. Experimental autocorrelation
functions were fitted, assuming a Gaussian intensity profile for single-photon
confocal microscopy.27 The parameter u is expressed as u = ks, with k being the eccentricity of the focal volume.
We considered a value for k of 3, as recommended
for single-photon confocal measurements.27 Transitions to the triple state, due to intersystem crossing (blinking),
were computed as , where B is the fraction
of blinking molecules and τB is their characteristic
rate. Estimates of the diffusion coefficient for Cy5 were DCy5 = 250 μm2 s–1 (estimated standard error = 1.3; t value = 194.5;
Pr (>|t|) = 0); and for Cy5-PcExl1
were DPcExl1 = 136 μm2 s–1 (estimated standard error = 2.4; t value = 56.1; Pr (>|t|) = 0). The
typical
triplet state estimates for Cy5 were B = 0.13 (estimated
standard error = 2.7 × 10–2; t value = 4.9; Pr (>|t|) = 9.1 × 10–7), and τB = 9.1 × 10–6 s
(estimated standard error = 1.1 × 10–6; t value = 4.6; Pr (>|t|) = 3.4 ×
10–7), which agree with the corresponding estimates
for
cyanine dye Cy5 obtained under similar experimental conditions.35 Typical estimates for triplet state of Cy5-labeled PcExl1 were B = 0.3 (estimated standard
error = 2.3 × 10–2; t value
= 12.3; Pr (>|t|) = 8 × 10–35) and τB = 9.9 × 10–6 s (estimated
standard error = 1.6 × 10–6; t value = 6.2; Pr (>|t|) = 5.9 × 10–10).
