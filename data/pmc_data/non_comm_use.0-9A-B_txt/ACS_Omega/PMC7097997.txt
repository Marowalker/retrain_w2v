Capping agents play an important
role in the synthesis of silver
nanostructures in polyol solvents. In this work, we demonstrate that
using a small amount of tannic acid (TA), a reducing capping agent,
in addition to poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a protective capping
agent, can lead to the production of monodisperse spherical silver
nanoparticles (Ag NPs) that are stable with respect to particle aggregation
for at least 100 days and have particle sizes ranging from 16 to 28
nm depending on the TA concentration. We hypothesize that the complexation
between PVP and TA can lead to the formation of a stable particle
coating and a fast Ag+ reduction rate at a relatively high
TA concentration. Both effects can benefit the formation of small
spherical Ag NPs with narrow size distribution.

Introduction
Silver nanostructures,
such as nanoparticles (NPs) and nanowires
(NWs), have found use in a wide range of applications, such as in
transparent electronic devices,1−3 biosensors,4,5 and
photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.6,7 Stable and
monodisperse Ag NPs are desired in many applications.7,8 The focus of this study is to prepare such particles using the polyol
synthesis method, which is simple to perform and scalable and has
been shown to produce a wide variety of silver nanostructures.9,10

Capping agents play an important role in controlling the shape
and size of silver nanostructures produced in polyol reactions. The
preferential adsorption of capping agents onto specific silver crystal
facets can serve to control both the size and shape of silver nanocrystals.
For example, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) is a commonly used capping
agent, and it preferentially adsorbs onto (100) silver crystal surfaces
over (111) facets, which can facilitate the growth of Ag NWs.11,12 Some capping agents can also serve as reducing agents, and the rate
of reduction can be controlled by varying concentration and temperature.
For example, tannic acid (TA) and citrate are two capping agents
that can also reduce Ag+ to Ag(0) and have been employed
in successful syntheses of silver nanostructures in both water and
polyol solvents.13−18

Furthermore, using a capping agent that can serve as a reductant
in addition to a protective capping agent in a single reaction may
lead to the size-controlled synthesis of monodisperse Ag NPs that
are stable in suspension for long periods of time. In the work reported
by Bastús et al., sodium citrate and a small amount of TA were
used together in the aqueous synthesis of Ag NPs.15 In their reaction, TA induced fast Ag+ reduction
at the early stage of the reaction to produce a large number of nuclei,
which led to the formation of small monodisperse particles. The particle
size can be controlled by TA concentration. The citrate ions effectively
capped the Ag NP surfaces, and the resulting Ag NPs were free from
aggregation for over 49 days.15

In
this work, we report the production of stable monodisperse Ag
NPs produced by using both TA and PVP in polyol. In addition to the
synergy described above, the complexation between TA and PVP may improve
the stability of the nanoparticles against aggregation at a relatively
low PVP concentration. The PVP–TA complexation might also suppress
TA–Ag+ chelation, which could allow for the fast
production of small Ag NPs at higher TA concentrations.

Results and Discussion
Monodisperse and stable dispersions of Ag NPs were produced using
a polyol-based synthesis method with a mixture of two capping agents,
PVP and TA (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows
UV–vis spectra, representative transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images, and size distributions of Ag NPs produced in ethylene
glycol using 1 mM PVP and 5–1000 μM TA. The TEM images
demonstrate a narrow size distribution when the TA concentration is
between 50 and 150 μM. The UV–vis spectra of Ag NP suspensions
produced using TA concentrations of 150 μM or lower have single
absorbance peaks that are relatively narrow, which also suggest monodisperse
particle sizes.19,20 In addition, the product Ag NPs
appear to have uniform coatings in TEM images, with an average thickness
of ca. 2–3 nm. Such synthesis using mixed capping agents could
be readily reproduced, with four trials of the reaction using 100
μM TA exhibiting UV–vis spectra that were practically
indistinguishable (Figure S1a). To test
the stability of the Ag NPs in suspension, as-prepared suspensions
were stored at 4 °C for 100 days, and no evidence of aggregation
was observed (Figure S1b,c). Reactions
using 1 mM PVP with TA ranging from 5 to 150 μM all produced
homogeneous near-spherical Ag NPs (Figure 1a,b), and the average size of Ag NPs gradually
decreased with higher concentrations of TA, from 27 nm at 5 μM
TA to 19 nm at 150 μM TA (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 (a) UV–vis spectra of as-prepared product mixtures
from
reactors prepared using 30 μM AgOCOCF3, 1 mM PVP,
and a varied concentration of TA at 150 °C. Each spectrum is
normalized to its highest peak. Representative TEM images are shown
in (b1–b6), and particle size and coating layer thickness distributions
of the Ag NPs produced from these reactions are shown in (c). TA concentrations
used for (b1–b6) are 5, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 1000 μM,
respectively. In (c), boxes represent the 10–90% probability
of the size or thickness distribution, whiskers represent 1–99%
probability of the size or thickness distribution, and squares in
the boxes represent mean values.

We hypothesize that the formation of small spherical Ag NPs with
narrow size distribution is facilitated by the complexation of PVP
and TA.21 The spontaneous formation of
particles in solutions containing TA and PVP can be demonstrated by
a simple, qualitative light scattering test, in which a red laser
is shined through the EG mixtures containing PVP, TA, or both PVP
and TA (Figure S2). At room temperature,
mixtures containing 1 mM PVP (by repeat unit) and TA at a concentration
higher than 5 μM showed significantly stronger light scattering
than the mixtures containing PVP or TA alone, suggesting the formation
of PVP–TA particles. These particles may result from the exothermic
PVP–TA complexation described by Bizley et al.21 Although light scattering decreased in all mixtures when
heated to 150 °C, PVP–TA mixtures still exhibit stronger
scattering than PVP or TA in EG.

The PVP–TA complexation
may lead to a better coating on
Ag NPs, which could inhibit aggregation as compared to using PVP alone.
The similar UV–vis absorbance peak shapes and widths of the
as-prepared product suspensions using PVP alone as compared to using
both PVP and TA (Figures S1 and S3) suggest
that both conditions can produce Ag NPs with narrow size distributions.
However, after particle separation and washing, substantial particle
aggregation was observed in dispersions of Ag NPs produced from polyol
reactions without the addition of TA (Figure 2). In contrast, Ag NPs from PVP–TA
reactions had monodispersed size distributions, as can be seen in
the TEM images and histograms of Figure 1. In fact, both PVP and TA were detected
in Ag NP samples collected from PVP–TA syntheses via infrared
spectroscopy (Figure S4). The characteristic
peaks of both PVP and TA were observed. These data suggest that the
coating produced in solutions containing the PVP–TA complexes
is more effective in preventing aggregation as compared to that from
PVP of similar concentrations.

Figure 2 Representative TEM images of Ag NPs produced
from polyol reactions
at 150 °C using 30 μM AgOCOCF3 and varied concentrations
of PVP: (a) 1 mM, (b) 2 mM, (c) 3 mM, and (d) 4 mM. Average Ag NP
diameters and standard deviations are marked on each image.

The PVP–TA complexation may also influence
the rate of Ag+ reduction. It has been demonstrated that
fast Ag+ reduction at the early stage of reaction can lead
to the production
of smaller spherical Ag NPs with narrow size distribution and slow
reduction of larger Ag NPs.22 TA can induce
two opposing effects on the reaction kinetics: (1) TA is a reducing
agent and can accelerate Ag+ reduction,15 and (2) TA can chelate Ag+ and lower the free
Ag+ concentration in solution, which would decelerate Ag+ reduction.23,24 For example, polyol reactions
performed using TA without the addition of PVP were sensitive to TA
concentration (Figure 3). Monodisperse Ag NPs were produced when using 1 or 10 μM
TA (TA/AgOCOCF3 molar ratios at 1:30 and 1:3, respectively; Figure 3a,b). However, the
higher concentration of 100 μM and 1 mM TA led to Ag NPs with
heterogeneous shapes and wide size distributions (Figure 3c,d). The broadened particle
size distribution can be explained by the slower Ag+ reduction,
which was presumably caused by TA–Ag+ chelation,
and similar results are reported in the literature for aqueous Ag
NP synthesis using TA.23,24

Figure 3 Representative TEM images of Ag NPs produced
from polyol reactions
at 150 °C using 30 μM AgOCOCF3 and varied concentrations
of TA: (a) 1 μM, (b) 10 μM, (c) 100 μM, and (d)
1 mM. Average Ag NP diameters and standard deviations are marked on
each image.

PVP–TA complexation may
suppress the chelation of Ag+ by TA and accelerate Ag+ reduction when PVP and
TA are both present. This can explain the decreasing particle size
observed at higher TA concentrations (Figure 1). In addition, the narrower size distribution
of Ag NPs is consistent with faster nucleation and slower and less
subsequent growth on the existing Ag NPs. At the concentrations employed
in this work, the relation between Ag NP size and TA concentration
did not extend to the highest TA concentration (1 mM) employed. At
the higher TA concentration (TA/AgOCOCF3 molar ratio at
3.3:1), polydisperse and aggregated Ag NPs were produced.

To
track the reaction rate, UV–vis absorbance spectra of
reaction mixtures were measured over time. Aliquots collected from
PVP–TA reactions had narrower peak widths than observed from
reactions using PVP without the addition of TA, which suggested narrower
Ag NP size distributions. In addition, reactions using 1 mM PVP with
0–100 μM TA were all very rapid, and the reaction extent
exceeded 70% within 1 min (Figure S5),
rendering these measurements inconclusive in terms of comparing reaction
rates.

To better demonstrate the effect of TA and PVP on the
reaction
rate at early stages, a series of scaled-up Ag NP syntheses (each
with 25 mL of reaction mixture volume) were performed in 100 mL Schlenk
bottles. The scaled-up reactions exhibit slower reaction rates than
the aforementioned rapid reactions performed in 20 mL scintillation
vials (each with 5 mL of reaction mixture volume). As compared to
the scaled-up reaction using 1 mM PVP, the reaction using 1 μM
TA in the absence of PVP and the reaction using 1 μM TA and
1 mM PVP were both significantly faster (Figures 4 and S6). When
the TA concentrations were increased to 100 μM, the rate of
both reactions decreased, which could be explained by the TA–Ag+ chelation. However, the reaction using 100 μM TA without
the addition of PVP was significantly slower than the one using 100
μM TA with 1 mM PVP. These observations demonstrated that the
PVP–TA complexation may suppress TA–Ag+ chelation
and promote Ag+ reduction at relatively high TA concentrations.

Figure 4 Plots
of reaction extent over time for scaled-up polyol reactions
(each with a 25 mL total volume) at 150 °C using 30 μM
AgOCOCF3 and varied concentrations of (a) PVP only or mixtures
of PVP and TA, and (b) PVP only or TA only. Reaction extent was calculated
by dividing the absorbance peak area between 350 and 550 nm of the
corresponding UV–vis spectrum (Figure S6) by that of the 60 min sample from the reaction using 1 mM PVP and
10 μM TA.

TA is both a reducing agent and
a chelating agent for Ag+. More interestingly, its complexation
with PVP makes its effect
more unique. The combined effect of PVP and TA influences the rate
of Ag+ reduction at different stages of the reaction, the
rate of Ag atom addition onto existing silver particles, and the aggregation
of Ag NPs.

Therefore, the combined effect of PVP and TA makes
the synthesis
of Ag NPs in the TA–PVP system unique. Our results showed that
using TA in combination with PVP in a polyol reaction may improve
the size and shape control of the Ag NPs produced. A different species
that is both a reducing agent for Ag+ and a capping agent
of Ag NPs would have a different effect on the reaction when used
together with PVP. For example, citrate is another commonly employed
reducing capping agent in Ag NP syntheses in EG,11,25 but it neither forms a complex with PVP nor forms a chelate with
Ag+ in the same way as TA. Indeed, Ag NP syntheses using
PVP and citrate with similar conditions as the PVP–TA reactions
resulted in particles with poor size and shape control (Figure S7).

Moreover, the wide range of
optimal TA concentration in our PVP–TA
method can be an advantage. When using the monodisperse Ag NPs as
seeds for additional silver growth, it is beneficial to directly use
the as-prepared particle suspension since separating and washing the
Ag NPs may compromise their reactivity in the growth reaction.26−28 A wider optimal concentration range leaves more room for the choice
of seed growth reaction conditions.

Conclusions
This
work employed a combination of protective and reducing capping
agents in the synthesis of Ag NPs in EG: PVP and TA. Reactions using
both PVP and TA produced stable monodisperse Ag NPs with better size
and shape control as compared to using TA or PVP alone. The PVP–TA
synergy observed may be the result of complexation between PVP and
TA, which enhances Ag NP protection and facilitates control over the
reaction rate. The PVP–TA reaction system also has a relatively
wide range of optimal TA concentration, which provides a handle for
size control and could be beneficial for using the Ag NPs in seeded
silver nanostructure syntheses. Similar strategies using mixed capping
agents may be applied in the colloidal syntheses of varied metal nanoparticles.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Instruments
Chemicals used in this study
included MilliQ Water (using Millipore, 18.2 MΩ), ethylene glycol
(EG, ACS certified, Fisher Chemicals), silver trifluoroacetate (AgOCOCF3, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Alfa Aesar,
M.W. 1 300 000), sodium citrate dihydrate (ACS reagent,
Macron), and tannic acid (TA, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich). Solvents
and chemicals were used as received. Silver trifluoroacetate solutions
were freshly prepared before reaction, during which silver salt was
handled using plastic scoopula.

Instruments used for Ag NP synthesis
included a magnetic stir plate, 20 mL scintillation vials, a 100 mL
Schlenk bottle, an argon purging gas line, a heating mantle, and a
temperature control unit composed of an Omega PFA-coated 12″
type J thermocouple and an NI USB-TC01 thermocouple measurement device.
All glassware was cleaned by submerging in a 4 M HNO3 solution
for at least 8 h, rinsed using MilliQ water, and then dried before
use.

Reaction Procedures and After Treatments
The Ag NP
syntheses using various PVP, TA, and sodium citrate concentrations
were performed in 20 mL scintillation vials under argon. In each reaction
vial, appropriate volumes of EG, PVP in EG, TA in EG, and sodium citrate
in EG (Table S1) were added to make EG
solutions with a total volume of 4.9 mL. With magnetic stirring, the
reaction mixtures were heated to 150 °C and held at that temperature
for 30 min under an argon atmosphere. Then, 100 μL of 1.5 mM
AgOCOCF3 in EG was injected, resulting in a 5 mL reaction
mixture with a Ag+ concentration of 30 μM, as well
as the desired PVP and TA concentrations. The reaction mixture was
held at 150 °C for another 1 h before cooling by submersion of
the reaction vessel in an ice bath. For reaction rate measurements,
the vessels were held at 150 °C for various times after AgOCOCF3 injection and immediately followed by cooling in an ice bath.

To separate the particles from a reaction mixture and prepare samples
for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 500 μL of the reaction
mixture was mixed with 1.5 mL MilliQ water. The resulting mixture
was centrifuged (16 500g for 40 min), and
the supernatant was discarded. The particles were then resuspended
in 1 mL MilliQ water and centrifuged again (16 500g for 40 min). Finally, the particles were resuspended in 20 μL
MilliQ water, dropped onto a holey-carbon-coated copper TEM grid,
and dried in air.

A series of scaled-up Ag NP syntheses were
performed in 100 mL
Schlenk bottles under argon. In each reaction, appropriate volumes
of EG, TA in EG, and PVP in EG (Table S2) were added to make a solution with a total volume of 24.5 mL. With
magnetic stirring, the reaction mixture was heated to 150 °C
and held at that temperature for 30 min under an argon atmosphere
using an argon purging gas line (not a Schlenk line). Then, 500 μL
of 1.5 mM AgOCOCF3 in EG was injected, resulting in a 25
mL reaction mixture with a Ag+ concentration of 30 μM
and the desired PVP and TA concentrations. The reaction mixture was
held at 150 °C for an additional hour before cooling by submersion
of the reaction vessel in an ice bath. During the reaction, several
samples (1.5 mL each) were taken from the reaction mixture at different
time points after AgOCOCF3 injection and immediately followed
by cooling in an ice bath.

Nanostructure Characterization and Analysis
UV–vis
spectra were obtained from as-synthesized product mixtures using an
Agilent 8453 UV–vis system. An FEI Tecnai T12 transmission
electron microscope was used to collect TEM images of Ag NPs. The
Ag NP diameters were measured from the TEM images, and the coating
layer thickness was calculated by (dtotal – dAg)/2, in which dtotal is referred to the total diameter of Ag NPs, including
the coating layer, and dAg is the diameter
of the Ag NP core. Figure S1d shows a zoomed-in
TEM image illustrating how the polymer coating on Ag NPs can be observed
in TEM images. All size measurements were conducted manually in TEM
images using ImageJ.29
