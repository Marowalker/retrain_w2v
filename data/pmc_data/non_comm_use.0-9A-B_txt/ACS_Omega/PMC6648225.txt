==== Body
We would like to correct the
following minor errors in the paper:Figure 3 legend: Blue data points should be ss sims,
red data points should be tt sims, blue line should be ss elliptical,
and red line should be tt elliptical.

Figure 3 caption, lines 4 and 5 should read, “...for
the side-to-side configuration (blue) and the tip-to-tip configuration
(red).”

p 14965, column 2, paragraph
2, lines 8–10 should
read, “...has a higher energy compared to the  power law, whereas the
tip-to-tip configuration
has a lower energy...”

The above corrections
do not change any of the conclusions
of the paper.
