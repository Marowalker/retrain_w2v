The measurement of biological events
on the surface of live cells
at the single-molecule level is complicated by several factors including
high protein densities that are incompatible with single-molecule
imaging, cellular autofluorescence, and protein mobility on the cell
surface. Here, we fabricated a device composed of an array of nanoscale
apertures coupled with a microfluidic delivery system to quantify
single-ligand interactions with proteins on the cell surface. We cultured
live cells directly on the device and isolated individual epidermal
growth factor receptors (EGFRs) in the apertures while delivering
fluorescently labeled epidermal growth factor. We observed single
ligands binding to EGFRs, allowing us to quantify the ligand turnover
in real time. These results demonstrate that this nanoaperture-coupled
microfluidic device allows for the spatial isolation of individual
membrane proteins while maintaining them in their cellular environment,
providing the capability to monitor single-ligand binding events while
maintaining receptors in their physiological environment. These methods
should be applicable to a wide range of membrane proteins.

Introduction
Cell-surface receptors
play a primary role in translating extracellular
signals into intracellular messages.1−5 A variety of biochemical and microscopy-based techniques have been
developed to both monitor ligand interactions with membrane receptors
and measure downstream signaling events.1,6−12 Whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiology are often employed
to monitor the functional activity of ion channels. Fluorescence imaging
and complementary techniques provide insights for ligand–receptor
binding events, which initiate essential chemical and electrical communication
between the intracellular and extracellular environments.4,13−15 Understanding these interactions is a key component
to deciphering the role these signaling events play in the proliferation
of diseases such as cancer. Although existing approaches have added
significant understanding of the structure and function of receptors,
most involve ensemble measurements that lack the specificity to monitor
the dynamics of individual receptor–ligand activity.16−18 Single-molecule studies of membrane proteins are limited by intracellular
autofluorescence, weak fluorophore emission, membrane protein mobility
on the cell surface, and high protein concentrations that are incompatible
with single-molecule measurements. One approach to address the challenge
of fluorophore brightness is the use of relatively large but photostable
labels such as quantum dots,19 which can
be utilized to monitor membrane receptor mobility and, in some circumstances,
ligand interactions.20,21 However, these studies are complicated
by the relatively large size of functionalized quantum dots, and their
potential toxicity limits their practical use in many applications.22

An alternative approach to visualizing
single-membrane receptors
on the cell surface is the isolation of small extensions of the cell
membrane using nanoaperture arrays such as zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs),
which have previously been used to study single receptors on the surface
of live cells.6 ZMWs have been utilized
for a variety of applications including DNA sequencing23−33 and the isolation of purified proteins for single-molecule Förster
resonance energy-transfer studies. ZMWs are well-suited for single-molecule
studies because the excitation light is confined to a small domain
near the entrance of the aperture. Rather than light transmitting
through the ZMW, an evanescent wave is generated that exponentially
decays away from the entrance and the resulting small spatial dimensions
of the focal volume (∼10–21 L) allow for
single-molecule measurements at micromolar concentrations.25 Only fluorescent molecules in the lower portion
of the ZMW are within the observation volume and visible with fluorescence
excitation. ZMWs can also be employed for cell-based studies. Proteins
at high concentrations on the surface of live cells can be isolated
at single-molecule levels in protrusions of small portions of the
plasma membrane in the apertures. With the correct properties, metal
composition, and size, ZMWs can also be tuned to enhance the fluorescence
signal of single fluorophores for both immobilized molecules33−36 and those in solution.37−39

One major drawback of cell-based
studies using standard ZMWs is
that the apertures are only accessible from one side of the device.
Devices are normally fabricated on a thin (∼150 μm) glass
substrate that serves as the backbone for the ZMW while the apertures
themselves are patterned in a thin metal film on top of the substrate.
This configuration is not compatible with monitoring single-ligand
interactions with cell surface receptors, as the glass substrate that
serves as a base for the ZMW makes them inaccessible to solution exchange
from the side of the device opposite the cells. Recently, the Wanunu
group has fabricated a hybrid ZMW with a 5 nm nanopore drilled through
its center.31 Fabrication of the device
on a silicon nitride membrane allowed solution exchange through the
5 nm pore and voltage-driven delivery of DNA to the pore for optical
and electrical measurements. Arrays of similar nanoporous membranes
have also been used as sensors for analyte trapping and monitoring.40−44

Here, we developed a new device that integrated ZMW arrays
(40 000
holes) with microfluidic delivery that was compatible with isolating
small portions of the plasma membrane on a live cell. To allow for
solution delivery from both sides of the device, we fabricated ZMWs
on a 120 nm thick silicon nitride substrate coated with a 100 nm thick
gold layer and coupled this with the microfluidic device. A network
of microfluidic channels was microfabricated in polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS), and one surface of the microfluidic device was then mounted
on a glass coverslip while the ZMW was integrated into the opposing
surface. The microfluidic cavity between the glass and ZMW was approximately
80 μm tall, allowing for fluid to be delivered to the underside
of the ZMW device, but still making it compatible with high numerical
aperture (NA) objectives necessary for single-molecule imaging. A
schematic of the device is shown in Figure 1. This approach provides the benefits achieved
with standard ZMWs such as isolating single proteins from high concentrations,
limiting cellular autofluorescence, and providing fluorescence enhancement
while retaining the freedom to monitor ligand fluorescence delivered
via the microfluidic channels. This enabled us to individually address
multiple receptors simultaneously and observe ligand binding and unbinding
events at each receptor location.

Figure 1 (A) Diagram depicting the assembly of
the array and the microfluidic
device. The gold-coated SixNy membrane patterned with 230 nm diameter ZMWs is
bonded to the underside of a PDMS microfluidic delivery system using
an oxygen plasma with a glass coverslip capping the bottom. Excitation
light is directed through the objective and focused on the sample
plane through the microfluidic. Emission is collected by the same
objective and directed via a dichroic toward the EMCCD. (B) Schematic

wells. The cell is shown in purple with an extension of the membrane
containing an EGFR shown in green extends into the well. EGF is represented
by the red molecule binding to the green receptor in the schematic.
A syringe pump is used to wash in EGF-A647, and a 640 nm laser excitation
is used to visualize binding events.

Results and Discussion
We demonstrate that our microfluidic-ZMW
(mf-ZMW) devices can be
used to image single-ligand delivery events by culturing cells that
express epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) within the ZMWs.
The plasma membrane extended into several of the wells lying under
each cell. The receptors are contained in filopodia-like projections
into the wells, which limits the number of EGFRs within them. ZMWs
are subwavelength apertures, so light is not transmitted through the
well. Only receptors near the lower end of the well would be visible.
Although the dimensions of the aperture and the extension of filopodia-like
structures limit the numbers of receptors in the wells, there is likely
more than a single receptor in the well. However, the dimensions of
the apertures limit the number of ligands being delivered from the
microfluidic side of the well. At the concentration of ligand used
in our studies (20 nM), the simultaneous delivery of more than one
ligand to a single well would be a rare event. We delivered fluorescently
labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) via the microfluidic channel
(Figure 1). This enabled
us to directly observe and quantify binding and unbinding events at
the single-ligand level, which consequently allowed us to determine
ligand turnover based on single interactions.

Fabrication and Characterization
of mf-ZMWs
Gold ZMWs
were fabricated on ∼120 nm thick low-stress silicon-rich silicon
nitride (SixNy) membranes (Figure S1B). This hybrid
ZMW SixNy membrane
acts as a support for the metal film instead of a glass coverslip,
which is typically used. Because the SixNy membrane is ≥1400 times thinner
than a glass coverslip, the ZMW features can be patterned through
it. The hybrid membrane structure is plasma-bonded with a microfluidic
delivery system, allowing cells to adsorb onto the SixNy side of the ZMW while
solution is delivered from a microfluidic channel bonded to the metal
side of the membrane. We utilized two different substrates. The first
was commercially available porous SixNy substrates (Norcada Inc.) with 2 μm
diameter holes. These substrates are compatible with cell culture
and integration with a microfluidic device and could also be easily
coated with a metal layer; however, the well diameters were too large
to create the confined focal volume effect present in true ZMWs. However,
it was possible to use these larger apertures to optimize the process
of integrating the silicon nitride membrane with microfluidics and
to verify cell membrane protrusion into the wells and ligand delivery
through the microfluidic channels. We coated one side of these membranes
with a 10 nm layer of chromium, followed by a 90 nm layer of gold.
The opposite face of the membrane was bonded to a microfluidic device
composed of PDMS (Figure 1). To test the viability of the device, we cultured mouse
neuroblastoma (N2a) cells expressing EGFR fused to green fluorescent
protein (GFP) directly on the unmodified gold surface of the substrate.
Imaging the GFP through the transparent microfluidic cavity showed
that the cell plasma membrane had extended into the wells (Figure 2A). We then delivered
EGF conjugated to a fluorescent label [(tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)]
through the microfluidic device. All studies with 2 micron apertures
utilized TMR-labeled EGF. Although the cells showed no background
fluorescence at 561 nm excitation prior to delivering EGF–TMR,
the preferential binding of ligands to EGFR–GFP was apparent
postdelivery (Figure 2B). TMR fluorescence was observed only in those wells where GFP fluorescence
was also present. These initial results also verified that the microfluidic
device could be fabricated thin enough (<140 μm) to be compatible
with the working distance of high-NA objectives. This demonstration
also showed that preferential delivery of a ligand to a cell-surface
receptor could be achieved with no apparent nonspecific interactions
of the ligand with the substrate or with portions of the cell membrane
not containing the EGFR.

is only visible where it extends into the wells. (B) Wide-field fluorescence
image of the same region showing preferential binding of TMR-labeled

We next fabricated devices with
∼230 nm diameter apertures
using a substrate composed of SixNy membranes fabricated at the Center for Nanophase
Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These
apertures are small enough to produce a true ZMW effect. To fabricate
these ZMWs, a 120 nm thick layer of SixNy was deposited on both sides of a 300
μm thick double-side-polished silicon wafer by using low-pressure
chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). ZMW features were patterned using
electron-beam lithography (EBL) on one side of the SixNy surface (the front
side) followed by reactive ion etching (RIE) of the nitride layer
down to the silicon substrate (Figure S2). A conventional contact alignment optical lithography process was
carried out on the backside of the wafer to pattern a window corresponding
to the area, which contained the ZMW features. After etching the SixNy layer on the
backside, the wafer underwent KOH wet etching to remove the exposed
silicon substrate all the way to the nitride membrane on the front
side (Figure S2). This resulted in devices
composed of a thick silicon frame with a thin silicon nitride membrane
suspended across the frame. The ZMWs extended all the way through
the SixNy membrane,
allowing access to the holes from either side. This device was then
coated with a 5 nm layer of chrome followed by a 100 nm layer of gold
using thermal evaporation (Figure S2H).
The apertures maintained the same diameter after metal deposition
(Figure S2G).

A PDMS microfluidic
device was fabricated so that the aperture
arrays could be integrated into the top internal surface of the microchannels
while the bottom surface of the channels was sealed with a 170 μm
thick glass coverslip (Figure 1A and B). The PDMS devices were designed with an internal
recessed surface; the ZMW arrays were designed such that the silicon
frame surrounding them could be plasma-bonded to the recessed surface
inside of the PDMS device. The glass coverslip was then plasma-bonded
to the other surface of the PDMS device, creating an enclosed fluidic
pathway that could be used to flow fluid past the gold-coated surface
of the ZMW arrays, while cells could be cultured on the opposing surface.
The apertures of the ZMWs using this fabrication method ranged between
210 and 230 nm, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy image
in Figure S2G.

Single-Ligand Binding
We cultured N2a cells expressing
EGFR–GFP directly onto the mf-ZMW, and an additional PDMS reservoir
was created on the SixNy side of the membrane to contain the cells and cell media.
We were able to monitor the cells using bright-field illumination
(Figure 3A) and via
GFP fluorescence with 488 nm excitation (Figure 3B). Excitation light was delivered from the
bottom side of the mf-ZMW through the microfluidic channels. High
levels of bright-field illumination from the top were sufficient to
locate cells with electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD)
detection. Neither lower level bright field nor laser illumination
was sufficient to image through the mostly opaque gold surface. Once
the cells were located with bright-field excitation, we used wide-field
fluorescence illumination to monitor the emission with an EMCCD to
quantify the cell footprint and the number of wells exhibiting plasma
membrane protrusions that also contained labeled receptors. Typically,
∼20% of the apertures under a cell footprint exhibited GFP
fluorescence, indicating plasma membrane containing EGFRs. Once the
apertures containing EGFRs were identified, we delivered a solution
containing 20 nM EGF labeled with Alexa 647 (A647) at a constant flow
rate through the microfluidic channel to the underside of the ZMW.
A647 was used for all single-molecule studies because it is a better
single-molecule fluorophore and the plasmon enhancement in gold ZMWs
is larger in the red region of the visible spectrum.45 While imaging through the microfluidic channel during ligand
delivery, diffuse fluorescence was observed and corresponded to EGF-A647
in solution. The presence of this fluorescence signal verified the
delivery of EGF to the ZMW, and at this point, we initiated data collection,
capturing images at a rate of 5 frames per second. Binding events
were observed where EGF molecules became immobilized in the location
of EGFR-containing apertures. As shown in Figure 4A,C, a single EGF molecule is readily visible
when it binds to an EGFR isolated in an aperture. In areas not containing
a bound EGF molecule, only diffuse background fluorescence was observed
because of labeled EGF flowing through the device. The single-step
photobleaching7,46 shown in the representative time
trace in Figure 4B
is indicative of the single-molecule behavior. The time trace shows
that while the ligand is bound, the fluorescence intensity is higher
for a period of time until the molecule photobleaches or the ligand
unbinds. This is also clearly visible in Figure 4C, where the ligand is not present in the
first frame just before binding. It is then visible for the next 5
frames and disappears for the final 2 frames after the molecule photobleaches.
A schematic illustrating the delivery and binding of single ligands
with EGFRs is shown in Figure 4D, demonstrating the use of mf-ZMW devices to monitor ligand–receptor
turnover.

binding.

Effect of mf-ZMWs on Single-Molecule
Emission
Two of
the primary challenges in single-molecule imaging are fluorophore
brightness and photostability. Plasmonic structures including gold
ZMWs have previously been shown to enhance the fluorescence signal
of single-molecule fluorophores.35,38,39,47,48 To determine whether mf-ZMWs alter the photophysical properties
of fluorophores, we isolated single EGF-A647 ligands on the surface
of a glass substrate and compared them to the same molecules isolated
in mf-ZMWs. To bind EGF-A647 to glass substrates, we functionalized
glass coverslips with biotin using 2 mg/mL Silane-poly(ethylene glycol)-Biotin
in 95% EtOH for 30 min. EGF-A647 was coupled via streptavidin, and
the vacant binding site was used to immobilize the molecule on the
biotin-coated surface.

We measured the photostability and brightness
of fluorophores under both conditions using 640 nm excitation and
EMCCD detection of single molecules. Fluorophores on a glass substrate
exhibited a fluorescence intensity (IFl) of 362 counts per 200 ms (Figure 5A), whereas molecules in the mf-ZMW showed an IFl of 1215 counts per 200 ms (Figure 5B). These studies indicate
that similar to standard ZMWs, mf-ZMWs enhance the fluorescence signal
of nearby fluorophores. Because the photostability of molecules will
directly impact the duration that ligands can be monitored after delivery
to the cell, we also compared the photostability of EGF-A647 on glass
substrates with that in the mf-ZMWs. Molecules on a glass substrate
had a survival time of 2.3 s (Figure 5D) and those in mf-ZMWs had a survival time of 1.3
s. The increase in fluorescence intensity and the decrease in photostability
are similar to what has been observed for molecules isolated in standard
gold ZMWs.35 Representative time traces
of molecules on glass versus that in an mf-ZMW are shown in Figure 5C. We then calculated
the relative number of detected photons for single EGF-A647 ligands
using the emission intensity and photostability of individual molecules.
Molecules in mf-ZMWs yielded 8580 ± 464 counts versus an average
of only 3691 ± 163 counts when isolated on the glass surface
(Figure 5F). This shows
a greater than 2-fold increase in the number of detected photons for
the ligand bound to the EGFR as seen in the representative time traces
(Figure 5C). The increase
in the number of detected photons in the presence of the mf-ZMW is
likely due to a combination of plasmon-related enhancement occurring
during both excitation and emission and arising from the interaction
of light with the metal nanostructures. Gold ZMWs in particular have
recently been observed to contribute to a similar fluorescence enhancement
of fluorophores, which excite at 640 nm excitation.35

survive for approximately 2.3 s. (E) Plot of the average survival
time (τST) for single EGF-A647 molecules bound to
EGFR in the nanoarray showing that they survive for approximately
1.3 s. (F) Plot comparing the average number of detected photons (IFL × τST) for single molecules
on glass to those in mf-ZMWs showing roughly a 2-fold increase. Error
bars represent the standard deviation.

Time-Lapse Single-Molecule Imaging to Determine Ligand Turnover
Fluorophore survival times before photobleaching limit the duration
that we can continuously monitor ligand–receptor interactions.
Constant excitation leads to the detection of ligands for approximately
4–6 frames (0.8–1.2 s of continuous imaging) before
photobleaching. This is likely shorter than the lifetime of EGFRs
on the plasma membrane. Common strategies to increase photostability
such as reducing the excitation intensity and the use of an oxygen
scavenging system were not compatible with the mf-ZMW device. Our
excitation intensity was set at the minimum level to be able to distinguish
the fluorophore signal from the background. Strategies to eliminate
oxygen, such as the use of oxygen scavenging systems in sealed environments,49,50 can alter the physiological environment and are often not compatible
with live cell studies. Additionally, the live cell chamber on the
top of the device combined with the fluid exchange of the mf-ZMW substrate
made it impossible to isolate fluorophores from the environment as
would be necessary for oxygen scavenging systems. To increase the
longevity of our observation window, we utilized time-lapse interval-based
single-molecule detection. This allowed us to extend the total amount
of time a ligand is visible by shortening the time the molecule was
continuously exposed to laser excitation. While the number of frames
(4–6) remained the same, increasing the interval between frames
allowed us to extend the observation times long enough to encompass
the turnover of EGF-A647. For example, using a time lapse with the
laser shuttered for 5 s between frames extends the experimental window
for ligand observation to 21 s. We performed time-lapse experiments
at increasing intervals until the average observed time of the bound
ligand decreased below the number of frames needed to photobleach
the molecule. Time-lapse interval measurements on the binding of EGF–EGFR
were performed by using the same experimental conditions as with the
continuous measurements, but with 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 40, and 100 s shuttered
intervals in between frames. The longer the time interval, the longer
the A647 fluorophore on EGF can be monitored for continued binding
to the EGFR. We observed an average of 3–5 frames per EGF–EGFR
binding event for all time-lapse interval measurements up through
intervals of 25 s. At 40 and 100 s intervals, there is a marked decrease
in the number of frames for which a single ligand is visible on the
mf-ZMW surface (Figure 6B). On the basis of our characterization of the photostability of
A647 (4–6 frames on average), a decrease in the number of frames
observed below this threshold can be attributed to the ligand unbinding
from the receptor and diffusing out of the ZMW aperture prior to being
photobleached. On average, the ligand was visibly bound to the receptor
for 2 frames at 40 s intervals and 1 frame with 100 s intervals (Figure 6B).

Figure 6 Turnover of EGFR and
EGF binding. (A) Schematic comparing continuous
excitation to time-lapse measurements. In each case, a total of 4
frames are taken, but with a built-in shuttered time interval, and
the total duration of the experiments is extended because of the interval.
Fluorophores that bleach in approximately 4 frames can be used to
measure dynamics on a longer time scale by introducing a shuttered
interval between frames. (B) Bar graph showing the average number
of frames a fluorophore is visible during a series of interval studies.
For 1–25 s intervals, there is no significant difference between
the groups (t-test, p < 0.01).
The average number of frames is equal to or greater than the 4 frame
bleaching level (dotted red line), indicating that the molecules are
bleaching before turnover. Time-lapse intervals ranging from 40 to
100 s show a drop below the 4 frame bleaching level, indicating that
the ligand is departing the surface prior to photobleaching. (C) Plot
of interval time vs the average time molecules were observable. At
longer time-lapse intervals, a clear plateau is reached, showing that
the turnover time is between 80 and 100 s.

We also plotted the time-lapse interval versus the average
duration
of molecules that were observed for each interval. The observed duration
was defined as the number of frames multiplied by the frame interval.
For example, with a 1 s interval, the average number of frames (200
ms exposure) was ∼4 frames and the duration was calculated
as 3.8 s (Figure 6A).
A clear plateau was seen in the length of time the molecules were
observed as the time-lapse interval increases (Figure 6C). When time intervals are not long enough
to extend the observation window beyond the turnover time, the observation
time increases sharply between consecutive intervals as seen in intervals
of 1–25 s (Figure 6B). The plateau observed at the 40 s interval indicates that
departure occurs prior to reaching the 4–6 frame photobleaching
regime. We attribute this to single-EGF turnover when bound to EGFRs.
Although ligand-induced endocytosis of the EGFR typically occurs on
a longer time frame51 than the intervals
studied here, our experiment does not differentiate between departure
of the A647-labeled EGF due to unbinding and the loss of fluorescence
due to internalization of the receptor–ligand complex. On the
basis of the differences in time scales for unbinding and internalization,
the vast majority of our observed events are likely due to ligand
turnover. These studies shown here are the first to observe single-ligand
turnover on the surface of a live cell and produce rates similar to
those shown in the studies of isolated EGF and EGFR on a glass substrate.52

Conclusions
We have developed a
hybrid system composed of arrays of nanoapertures
on a SixNy membrane integrated with a microfluidic delivery system. These devices
offer many of the same benefits as standard ZMWs such as fluorescence
enhancement and single-molecule isolation. However, they also offer
the additional advantage of being compatible with isolating nanoscale
domains of the plasma membrane, which can then be accessed using the
microfluidic device. The spatial isolation of these small domains
provides a way to monitor single proteins on the surface of a live
cell. Using EGFR and EGF, we have shown that mf-ZMWs can be used to
monitor single-ligand binding to EGF receptors. By reducing the ZMW
diameter to ∼200 nm, this method has the potential to be a
powerful tool capable of monitoring interactions between ligands and
virtually any receptor, by enabling the spatial isolation of single
receptors on the surface of a cell and providing access to these receptors
via microfluidic channels. The ability to isolate several molecules
in parallel on a cell surface and individually monitor receptor activity
should have a wide range of applications including functional measurements
of single channels, ligand–receptor interactions, and receptor
turnover.

Experimental Section
Fabrication of 230 nm ZMWs in Silicon Nitride
Membranes
All SixNy membrane fabrication processes were conducted at
the CNMS at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. Fabrication was performed using EBL to
pattern the ZMW features onto one side of a SixNy-coated silicon wafer (front
side), whereas photolithography was used to pattern larger (microscale)
features onto the backside. A combination of RIE and wet chemical
etching was used to produce nanoporous SixNy membranes suspended on a silicon substrate.
Prior to beginning the fabrication procedure, low-stress silicon-rich
silicon nitride (120 nm thickness) was deposited onto both sides of
300 μm thick 4 in. double-side polished silicon wafers by the
LPCVD process (Figure S2A).

ZMW features
were defined using a JEOL JBX-9300FS EBL system. First, the nitride-coated
silicon wafers were spin-coated with a ZEP-520A electron beam resist
(Zeon Chemicals, Japan) at 2000 rpm for 45 s and baked on a hot plate
at 180 °C for 2 min (Figure S2B).
The wafers were then exposed at a dose of 400 μC/cm2 with 100 kV acceleration voltage and 2 nA beam current. The patterned
wafers were then developed for 30 s in a xylenes solution, rinsed
with isopropanol (IPA), and dried with N2 gas (Figure S2C), followed by a 6 s oxygen plasma
exposure at 100 W and 10 sccm O2. The patterned silicon
nitride layers were then etched in an inductively coupled ion plasma
etching system (Oxford Plasmalab 100) down to the silicon substrate
with the e-beam resist as the etch mask (Figure S2D). The process was carried out in a mixture of 45 sccm octofluorocyclobutane
(C4F8) and 2 sccm O2 gases at 200
W radio frequency (rf) and 15 °C. The electron beam resist was
then removed by soaking the wafers in acetone for 60 min followed
by an oxygen plasma exposure to 100 sccm O2 at 10 W rf
for 5 min in the plasma etching system to remove any organic residue
(Figure S2E).

Once the ZMW arrays
were patterned onto the top side of the SixNy-coated wafers,
the backside of the wafers was patterned using conventional contact
alignment optical lithography and etched to complete the nanoporous
membranes (Figure S2F). Prior to photoresist
coating, an adhesion promoter MCC Primer 80/20 (MicroChem, Westborough,
MA) was spin-coated onto the SixNy surface at 3000 rpm for 45 s. A positive
photoresist MICROPOSIT S1818 (MicroChem, Westborough, MA) was used
to pattern the backside silicon nitride window. The wafers were then
baked on a hot plate at 115 °C for 1 min and exposed for 5 s
using a Quintel contact aligner. The wafers were developed using CD-26
solution (<5% tetramethylammonium hydroxide, MicroChem, Westborough,
MA) for 1 min and 50 s, rinsed with deionized (DI) H2O,
and dried with N2 gas. The wafers were exposed to an oxygen
plasma for 1 min to remove any residual photoresist. The backside
silicon nitride window was etched using the same recipe as for the
front side nitride. A 5 min oxygen plasma exposure was used to remove
the remaining S1818 photoresist.

The final step in the process
is to chemically etch the 300 μm
thick silicon from the backside of the wafers, to create suspended
nanoporous silicon nitride membranes. The wafers were submerged in
a 30% potassium hydroxide (KOH) bath at 80 °C for a period of
3 h.53 An apparatus was used to protect
the front side of the wafer, leaving the silicon nitride membrane
unharmed (Figure S2F). Upon removing from
the KOH solution, the wafers were rinsed gently with DI H2O and IPA. The wafers were placed in an electron beam evaporator
where 5 nm of chromium and 100 nm of gold were deposited onto the
front side of the wafer (Figure S2H). The
wafers were then cleaved into separate membrane devices. With the
deposition process completed, the perforated edges were separated
from one another and the individual membranes were ready for integration
into microfluidic devices (Figure S2H).

Cell Culture on Silicon Nitride Membranes
Mouse neuroblastoma
cells were transfected with EGFR labeled with GFP. The cells (3 million)
were plated in a T-75 flask in N2a-specific media (45% Opti-MEM, 45%
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and 10% fetal bovine
serum) and incubated for 24 h. The cells were transfected on day 2
using a modification of the standard Lipofectamine 2000 protocol.
EGFR–GFP (3500 ng) was added to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
containing 250 μL of Opti-MEM. Separately, 14 μL of Lipofectamine
2k was added to a second microcentrifuge tube containing 250 μL
of Opti-MEM. Both tubes were allowed to equilibrate for 5 min. During
this period of time, the N2a media were removed from the flask and
replaced with 10 mL of Opti-MEM. When the 5 min waiting period was
complete, the two microcentrifuge tubes were mixed together and left
to incubate for an additional 25 min. At the end of the 25 min waiting
period, the solution in the microcentrifuge tube was added to the
T-75 flask and placed back in the incubator for a period of 24 h.
After 24 h, the transfection mix was removed from the flask and the
cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After rinsing,
5 mL of Versene was added to the flask for 5 min to resuspend the
cells into the solution. The cell solution was then added to a conical
tube and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the cells. The
Versene solution was removed from the conical tube, and 2 mL of fresh
N2a media was added to the pellet. The cell concentration was measured
using a cytometer, and the concentration was adjusted to attain a
concentration of 100 cells/μL. The cell suspension was then
added to the membrane surface of the mf-ZMW devices. The devices were
placed in the incubator for 30 min to allow the cells to settle onto
the membranes; after this time, 400 μL of N2a media was added
to the surface and the devices were returned to the incubator until
imaging the following day.

Microscale Aperture Studies
Silicon
nitride membranes
with 2 μm apertures were purchased from Norcada Inc. to be used
in the microfluidic devices. These membranes were coated with 10 nm
of chromium followed by 90 nm of gold using sputter deposition. The
coated membranes were then plasma-bonded to the top inner surface
of PDMS microfluidic devices using a Harrick PDC-32G plasma cleaner;
to accomplish this, the membranes and PDMS were exposed to an oxygen
plasma for 30 s and then quickly removed from the vacuum chamber,
and the two surfaces to be bonded were pressed together to make a
permanent seal (Figure 1A). This bonding process was then repeated to plasma-bond the bottom
surface of the PDMS device to a clean, 150 μm thick glass coverslip
(Figure 1B).

Transfected N2a cells were added to the devices as described in the
previous section and were imaged with an Olympus 60× water objective
and wide-field epifluorescence laser excitation. Before moving forward
with the microfluidic delivery portion of the experiment, 488 nm laser
excitation was used to confirm the existence of EGFR–GFP-transfected
cells with membrane protrusions in the ZMWs. Next, the system was
observed at 561 nm excitation to ensure that there was no background
fluorescence to compete with the ligand EGF–TMR. Bovine serum
albumin (BSA), which is known to adsorb onto surfaces and prevent
nonspecific binding,54 was diluted to 0.1%
in PBS 1× and flushed through the microfluidic channels for 10
min using a syringe pump. Next, 10 nM EGF–TMR (in 0.01% BSA)
was flushed through the microfluidic channels for a period of 4 min.
BSA rinsate (0.1% in PBS 1×) was washed through the channels
once more to remove any unbound EGF–TMR conjugates. Images
of the devices were captured with a 200 ms exposure time per frame
on an inverted microscope to show the clear presence of EGFR–GFP
with 488 nm excitation and the specific binding of the ligand EGF–TMR
in the same locations using 561 nm excitation.

Single-Ligand Binding
Gold-coated SixNy membrane ZMWs with ∼230
nm diameter apertures were plasma-bonded to the inside of the microfluidic
delivery system, which were then plasma-bonded to a clean 22 ×
22 mm #1.5 glass coverslip. The ZMW was oriented such that the gold-coated
surface was facing down toward the glass coverslip and the SixNy side was facing
up. The distance between the gold-coated surface and the top of the
glass coverslip was <100 μm, making it possible to use high
NA objectives. N2a cells expressing EGFR–GFP were then plated
on the SixNy surface of the mf-ZMW devices.

Imaging of the mf-ZMW devices
was performed on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 81) using a 1.49
NA 100× oil immersion objective. An Andor iXon I3 EMCCD camera
was used to collect all data during these steps. First, the membrane
was brought into focus using bright-field illumination; because of
the semitransparency of 100 nm thick gold, the N2a cells could be
located during this step, despite imaging through the ZMW surface.
The regions with cells were then exposed to 488 nm excitation (Cobolt
MLD) to excite the GFP on the plasma membrane surface and determine
the presence of GFP-labeled receptors in the wells. Once the cells
were located, a Cole-Parmer syringe pump was used to deliver a buffer
solution containing 0.1% BSA in PBS 1× through the channel for
a period of 10 min at a flow rate of 20 μL/min. The position
of the cells was noted on the camera by capturing a 200 ms snapshot
with 488 nm excitation, and a second snapshot (200 ms) was captured
using 640 nm excitation (Cobolt MLD) to determine the fluorescence
background signal in the absence of A647.

A new solution containing
20 nM EGF-A647 in 0.1% BSA in PBS 1×
was delivered to the mf-ZMW devices at a flow rate of 10 μL/min
while monitoring the ZMW surface in real time with 640 nm excitation.
At higher concentrations of fluorescently labeled EGF, background
fluorescence from diffusing EGF obscured the signal from those bound
to the EGFR on the cell membrane. As soon as the fluorophores begin
passing into the field of view, the flow rate was reduced to 1 μL/min
for the data collection process. The slower flow rate was used to
avoid solution turbulence that caused bubbling and disrupted single-molecule
data collection. Data were collected by using an electronic shuttering
system to accurately control the timing of exposures to the 640 nm
laser. Continuous movies were collected without pause in between frames,
as well as time-lapse interval movies were collected with pauses between
frames that included 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 40, and 100 s intervals.

Data Analysis
All images were analyzed in ImageJ (NIH),
and data analysis was performed using OriginPro. Regions of interest
(ROIs) for single-ligand binding events were selected by using the
Time Series Analyzer 3.0 plugin with a square shape and 4 × 4
pixel size. These ROIs were overlaid with 488 nm excitation snapshots
of a cell to ensure that an event occurred within a well on the plasma
membrane. The ROIs were then measured for their longevity (fluorophore
survival time) and brightness (fluorescence intensity), which was
the average fluorescence intensity minus the fluorescence background
after photobleaching. These values were then averaged, and the error
bars represent the standard deviation of this population. For time-lapse
studies, the number of frames each single molecule lasted was averaged
for each of the intervals and the error was calculated as the standard
deviation of the same population. Any fluorophores that were present
during the first frame of the time-lapse interval measurements were
not included in the final data, as it was impossible to determine
how long the fluorophore was present before the movie began.
