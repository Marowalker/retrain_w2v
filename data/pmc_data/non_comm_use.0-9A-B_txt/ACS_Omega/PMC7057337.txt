In this study, we report a green and economical
hydrothermal synthesis of fluorescent-nitrogen-doped carbon quantum
dots (NCQDs) using citrus lemon as a carbon source. The prepared NCQDs
possess high water solubility, high ionic stability, resistance to
photobleaching, and bright blue color under ultraviolet radiation
with a high quantum yield (∼31%). High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) results show that the prepared NCQDs have
a narrow size distribution (1–6 nm) with an average particle
size of 3 nm. The mercury ion (Hg2+) sensing efficiency
of the NCQDs was studied, and the result indicated that the material
has high sensitivity, high precision, and good selectivity for Hg2+. The limit of detection (LOD) is 5.3 nM and the limit of
quantification (LOQ) is 18.3 nM at a 99% confidence level. The cytotoxicity
was evaluated using MCF7 cells, and the cell viabilities were determined
to be greater than 88% upon the addition of NCQDs over a wide concentration
range from 0 to 2 mg/mL. Based on the low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility,
and other revealed interesting merits, we also applied the prepared
NCQDs as an effective fluorescent probe for multicolor live cell imaging.

Introduction
At present, water contamination
by heavy metals has become a serious
problem.1 Heavy metals are toxic to aquatic
living organisms and harmful to humans through food-chain accumulation.2 Mercury is a heavy metal well known for its extremely
high toxicity and a threat to human life and the whole environment.3 Inorganic mercury in water mainly appears in
the toxic form of the Hg2+ oxidation state. As per the
World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation, the maximum uptake
of Hg2+ is 0.3 mg/week and the maximum acceptable limit
in drinking water is 1 μg/L.4 The
maximum level of mercury in drinking water permitted by the US Environmental
Protection Agency is 2 ppb.5 In this regard,
monitoring the concentration of Hg2+ in water is very essential.
Techniques for accurate quantification of trace concentrations of
mercury such as atomic absorption spectroscopy6 and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry7 provide limits of detection up to parts per billion
levels. However, their excellent performance is achieved at a high
cost and time-consuming sample preparation and preconcentration procedures.
As an alternative, fluorescent detection methods that can encompass
a variety of advantages, including real-time and remote measurements,
sensitivity and selectivity against competing analytes, and reliable,
compact, and low-cost detection, have been developed for sensing of
Hg2+ ions in an aquatic environment. Ncube et al.8 reported a fluorescent sensing probe based on
a naphthyl azo dye modified dibenzo-18-crown-6-ether for the detection
and determination of Hg2+ ions in water, and the probe
showed high sensitivity and selectivity for Hg2+ ions among
various alkali, alkaline earth, and transition-metal ions. Xia and
Zhu9 used surface-modified CdTe quantum
dots as fluorescent probes in the sensing of Hg2+ ions.
However, the highly toxic effect of inorganic quantum dots, low quantum
yield, and easy photobleaching of organic dyes have limited the application
of these materials in the real-environment detection of Hg2+ ions. Recently, Hg2+ ion probe based on the fluorescence
quenching of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) has been developed and received
intense attention because of its simplicity, sensitivity, and selectivity.10−12

Carbon dots, which are also known as carbon quantum dots (CQDs),
are a class of fluorescent nanomaterials with ultralow particle size
(<10 nm). CQDs have interesting properties such as unique bright
and tunable photoluminescence, high water solubility, excellent biocompatibility,
and stability to photodegradation and photobleaching.13 In comparison with other quantum dots that are derived
from heavy-metal precursors, CQDs are environmentally green and nontoxic
to cell.14 Because of these important properties,
the CQDs have attracted immense attention in various applications
such as analytical sensing,15 bioimaging,14 and photocatalysis.16

Much progress has been made in the synthesis of photoluminescent
CQDs using different methods. Researchers frequently used the hydrothermal
method since it is a facile, eco-friendly, one-step process with a
low synthesis cost as compared to other methods.17 Carbonization carried out by the hydrothermal method at
low temperature with self-created pressure is a green method because
no pollutant is released into the environment. Different natural products
like orange juice18 and amino acids19 have been used as precursors to prepare fluorescent
CQDs. Investigating new and green precursors for the economical synthesis
of fluorescent CQDs is important. In the search for new precursors
for carbon quantum dots, using environmentally green plant materials
is becoming most encouraging. However, the quantum yield of most of
the carbon quantum dots prepared from plant materials is relatively
low.20−24 In the search for high quantum yield carbon quantum dots from natural
products, we investigated the synthesis of NPQDs from lemon fruit
juice as a source of carbon.

Studies have shown that citric
acid is an excellent precursor for
the synthesis of CQDs because it has well-known low carbonization
temperature,18 and amine-containing molecules
such as ethylenediamine are able to passivate CQDs with amines and
form nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots, thus increasing the quantum
yield and selectively sensing analytes, such as Hg2+, Cu2+, and Cr6+ ions.14 In
spite of the controversy regarding the mechanism of the photoluminescence
(PL) of doped CQDs, it is agreed that trap states with different energy
levels can be introduced by surface groups, which result in excitation-dependent
fluorescence.25

The sour taste of
lemon juice is due to the presence of a high
concentration of citric acid.26 Motivated
by these, we synthesized water-soluble highly fluorescent-nitrogen-doped
carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) with high quantum yield (QY ∼ 31%)
using eco-friendly green hydrothermal synthesis methods utilizing
lemon juice as a precursor and ethylenediamine as the co-reagent.
The fluorescence intensity of the prepared NCQDs is based on the pH
value, and they have high photostability under different salt conditions,
high photobleaching resistance, and high water solubility. The cell
viability study using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay of the MCF7 cell line indicated that
the as-synthesized NCQDs are nontoxic. The prepared NCQDs were used
for Hg2+ ion sensing in water and cell imaging, and the
results revealed that they have great potential in sensing and biological
application.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Reagents
Citrus lemons were collected
fresh from the nearby market in Andhra University, India, and NCQDs
were prepared from the juice of these lemons using the hydrothermal
method. All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without
any further purification. Milli-Q water was used throughout the analysis.

Synthesis of NCQDs
Twenty milliliters of filtered fresh
lemon juice and 2 mL of ethylenediamine co-reagent were mixed in 100
mL hydrothermal autoclave and kept in a furnace at 200 °C for
3 h. The as-obtained black paste was cooled down to room temperature
and then dissolved in 15 mL of water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
15 min to separate insoluble matter. Then, dichloromethane was added
to the brown solution of NCQDs and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20
min to remove unreacted organic moieties. The separated upper aqueous
layer was then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min thrice
to remove larger-sized particles, and a brown-yellowish supernatant
was finally obtained. NCQDs with smaller particle sizes were separated
using column chromatography taking silica gel as the stationary phase
and dichloromethane as the solvent. The as-prepared NCQDs were stored
at 4 °C for characterization and used for applications.

Characterization
High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM, Jeol/JEM 2100, LaB6) operated at 200 kV was used
to determine the morphological and microstructural properties of the
prepared NCQDs. Further morphological and compositional information
of the samples was determined using field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Ultra-60) equipped with an X-ray energy-dispersive
spectroscope. PANalytical X’pert pro X-ray diffraction (XRD)
using Cu Kα1 radiation (45 kV, 1.54056 Å; scan
rate of 0.02°/s) was used to determine the crystalline pattern.
The IR spectra were obtained over the range of 400–4000 cm–1 using an Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer
(Bruker). The emission properties of the NCQDs were determined with
a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Scientific). The absorbance
spectra of NCQDs were recorded using a UNICAM UV 500 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Electron Corporation).

Quantum Yield
The following eq 1 was
used to calculate the quantum yield (QY)
by taking quinine sulfate in 0.1 M H2SO4 (the
quantum yield of 54% at 365 nm) as a reference.27 The QY of NCQDs was determined by following the reported
protocol. The UV–vis absorption at 365 nm and PL emission spectra
(excited at 365 nm) of carbon dots and reference was measured, respectively.
To reduce the reabsorption effects, the absorbance was kept under
0.05 at the excitation wavelength. The QY can be calculated using
the following equation 1  where QYsamp and QYref are the quantum yields; Isamp and Iref are emission
intensities; Asamp and Aref are the UV–vis
absorbances; and nsamp and nref are refractive indexes of the sample and reference,
respectively.

Sensing of Hg2+
The fluorescent
(FL) assay
of Hg2+ was carried out at room temperature using fluorescence
quenching of 25 μg/mL of NCQDs in phosphate-buffered solution
(PBS) at pH 7.4 (absorbance of solution = 0.05). For the detection
of Hg2+ ion, the NCQDs solution was taken in a cuvette
and 30 μL of different concentrations of Hg2+ was
added, and finally, the volume was adjusted to 3 mL by the NCQDs solution.
The FL emission spectra at 365 nm excitation were measured after reaction
for 5 min at room temperature. Selectivity study was done using competing
ions in place of Hg2+ and a mixture of other cations with
Hg2+. The reproducibility of the method was investigated
by recording the FL spectra of nine solutions prepared side by side
containing 1 × 10–8 M Hg2+ prepared
in the same procedure as mentioned above.

Cytotoxicity Test
The biocompatibility of NCQDs was
tested on human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cells using the MTT assay.
Cytotoxicity was evaluated by determining the activity of mitochondrial
enzymes in live MCF7 cells to transform the yellow MTT solution to
an insoluble purple formazan. MCF7 cells were cultured in 96-well
tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells
per well and then the cells were incubated in a medium containing
different doses of NCQDs for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed
and the cells were washed with the phosphate-buffered solution (PBS).
Fresh medium with 10 μL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT solution was supplemented
to each well and incubated for 4 h and then the medium was replaced
with 150 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by shaking
for 15 min to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance of each
well was measured at 570 nm using a multimode microplate reader (Biotek,
Cytation3). The untreated cells were used as controls for determining
the cell viability from the following equation 2  

Cell Imaging
The
bioimaging potential of NCQDs was
investigated using MCF7 cells. The MCF7 cells were cultured in 6-well
culture plates at a density of 105 cells per well in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (DMEM) having 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Then, the
medium was replaced with a fresh medium of 0.025 mg/mL NCQDs and incubated
for 6 h. After that the cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove
extracellular NCQDs, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted using
50% glycerol. Images were obtained using “Zeiss LSM 510 Meta
confocal Microscopy” at laser excitations of 405, 488, and
561 nm.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
Upon hydrothermal treatment of precursors
at 200 °C for 3 h and after separation as per procedures, the
brown solution of NCQDs was obtained, as shown in Scheme 1. Figure 1 shows the absorption and emission spectra
of the as-prepared NCQDs. The prepared NCQDs show two typical absorption
peaks at 245 and 353 nm, as shown in Figure 1 (black solid line), which extended with
a tail to the visible region. The absorption peak at 245 nm could
be assigned to the π–π* transition of aromatic
−C=C– bonds in the sp2-hybridized
domain of graphitic core and the other peak at 353 nm could be assigned
to the n–π* transition of −C=O,
C–N, or −C–OH bonds in the sp3-hybridized
domains, which may be from hydroxyl (−COOH) or amine (−NH2) group on the surface of NCQDs.28−31 The aqueous solution of NCQDs
with brown-yellowish color appears bright blue under ultraviolet radiation
(inset in Figure 1b),
which indicates the bright luminescence of the prepared NCQDs. Figure 1 (blue broken line)
indicates the emission spectra of the blue luminescent NCQDs, with
excitation at 360 nm and emission at 452 nm. Full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) value obtained at this particular fluorescence emission is
75 nm, indicating the narrow size distribution of the synthesized
NCQDs.32−35

Scheme 1 Scheme Showing Reaction of Precursors
to Produce NCQDs
To further study the
optical properties of the as-prepared NCQDs,
a fluorescence study was carried out at different excitation wavelengths.
To clarify the concept of photoluminescence, the 2D FL emission spectra
of the NCQDs can be divided into two parts: one with excitation wavelengths
from 300 to 410 nm (Figure 2a) and the other with the excitation wavelength from 410 to
490 nm (Figure 2b).
As seen from the figures, the sample shows fluorescence with symmetrical
peaks. The fluorescence emission intensity increases as the excitation
wavelength increases from 310 to 360 nm, and the maximum emission
intensity is obtained at the excitation wavelength of 360 nm. Further
increase in excitation wavelengths results in a decrease in emission
intensity. Overall, as the excitation wavelengths increase, the emission
wavelengths shift to longer wavelengths (red shift). Figure 2c depicts the fluorescence
emission–excitation spectra of the NCQDs, with excitation wavelengths
increasing from 300 to 400 nm in 4 nm steps and showing symmetrical
emission peaks. Figure 2d indicates the excitation and emission contour map of NCQDs showing
emission at different excitation wavelengths. The fluorescence of
NCQDS may be due to the π-plasmon absorption in the core carbon
nanoparticles,36 and, to large extent,
photoluminescence is highly affected by the surface chemistry of NCQDs.37 The as-synthesized NCQDs show a high FL quantum
yield (QY ∼ 31%) relative to the standard quinine sulfate.
This relatively high QY is due to nitrogen doping in NCQDs, as heteroatom
doping may significantly improve the QY of carbon dots and N doping
may provide the most effective enhancement to QY.38−40 As shown in Table 1, compared to the
NCQDs synthesized using different plant materials as precursor, the
NCQDs synthesized from citrus lemon juice in this work has a high
QY.41−46 NCQDs showed the conversion FL in addition to strong down-converted
FL properties. Figure S3a shows the FL
spectra as NCQDs are excited with a longer-wavelength light with emissions
centered at a wavelength of 450 nm, which is comparable to that of
the down-converted FL peaks.

The ionic strength of the as-synthesized NCQDs was investigated
at different concentrations (0.25–2 M NaCl), and it was obtained
that the change in the concentration of salt has no significant effect
on the fluorescence of NCQDs (Figure 3a). In addition, NCQDs have shown high FL stability
in that neither significant shift in emission wavelength nor significant
reduction in FL intensity is observed upon continuous exposure to
ultraviolet radiation from 1 to 45 min (Figure 3b) and after 3 months of storage. The effect
of pH on the fluorescence property of NCQDs was investigated and the
fluorescence intensity of the NCQDs depends on the pH of the solution
but there is no shift in emission wavelength. Decreasing pH from 6
to 2 increased the FL intensity (Figure 3c) and increasing the pH from 8 to 12 decreased
the FL intensity (Figure 3d). These results described that under low pH values, the
NCQDs, probably, exist as isolated species in the aqueous solution;
the nanoparticles agglomerated with increasing pH value because of
interactions such as hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups.46 The change in fluorescence intensity with pH
change should result from the transition between isolated C–NH2 in acidic conditions and agglomerated C=NH in alkaline
conditions. As shown in Figure S8, the
surface nitrogen of NCQDs-OH existed in the form of imino groups in
the alkaline environment. However, the imino groups could be transformed
into amino groups in acidic conditions.

and after preservation for 1 and 3 months. (c) pH effect in acidic
media with a pH of 6–2. (d) pH effect in basic media with pH

The morphological properties of
the as-synthesized NCQDs were confirmed
by HRTEM (Figure 4a,b).
The results indicated that the NCQDs are uniformly distributed quasi-spherical
nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Particle sizes of the
NCQDs are of diameter in the range of 1–6 nm with an average
of 3 nm based on a statistical analysis of more than 90 dots (histogram
in Figure 4d). Figure 4c shows the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) of the NCQDs, the holes indicating
the particle formation and only two bright spots observed indicating
the amorphous nature. As shown in the inset of Figure 4a, the as-synthesized NCQDs exhibit a lattice
spacing of 0.19 nm, which is similar to the (100) facet of the sp2 graphitic carbon.49 X-ray diffraction
patterns show a broad and intense diffraction peak centered at 2θ
= 23° and a weak peak at 2θ = 42°, which is assigned
to the (002) and (101) diffraction patterns of graphitic carbon, as
shown in Figure 7a,
which indicates the amorphous nature of the NCQDs and is in accordance
with previous structure analysis on disordered amorphous graphitic
CQDs.50

images. (c) SAED of
NCQDs and (d) particle size distribution histogram.

Information regarding the surface functional group of NCQDs
was
investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As
can be seen in the spectrum (Figure 6b), there is a broad overlapping strong bands in the
range of 3070–3600 cm–1, which can be due
to the stretching vibration of the O–H and N–H bonds.
The vibrational band of the C–O bond at 1112 cm–1 confirms the presence of primary −OH groups on the surface
of NCQDs. The appearance of bands at 2934 cm–1 and
in the range of 1040–1300 cm–1 illustrates
the existence of aliphatic C–H and C–N/C–O functional
groups, respectively. The sharp band at 1546 cm–1 can be assigned to the N–H vibration and deformation band,
which indicates the presence of an amino functional group. In addition,
the existence of characteristic stretching and bending vibrational
bands for C–H and stretching vibrations for C=C in aromatic
hydrocarbons at 3060, 770, and 1434 cm–1 confirms
the presence of the aromatic skeleton (sp2-hybridized carbon)
in the prepared NCQDs. Hence, the FTIR analysis shows the presence
of functional groups such as alcohols, amines, aromatic rings, and
carbonyls on the surface and sp2/sp3 core carbon
in NCQDs derived from citrus lemon juice. The presence of different
functional groups on the surface makes the NCQDs highly water-soluble.51−53

Raman spectrometer analysis also confirmed the structural
properties
of NCQDs. As shown in Figure 5, the Raman spectrum of the NCQDs exhibits two peaks at 1348
and 1547 cm–1, corresponding to the D and G bands
of graphitic carbon, respectively. The ratio of ID/IG is 1.03, which is characteristic
of the disorder amorphous nature and the ratio of sp3/sp2 carbon, implying structural defects in the synthesized NCQDs.

FESEM images of a paper

NCQDs. The result
from the elemental composition analysis of the energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum (Figure 6c) reveals the presence of C, O, and N in the as-synthesized
material, indicating the formation of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum
dots.

spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum (inset elemental composition of NCQDs

Quantitative Assay
The mechanism to determine Hg2+ using fluorescence quenching
of NCQDs is based on the interaction
of oxygen/nitrogen-containing groups over the NCQDs surface with Hg2+ cations. The oxygen/nitrogen-containing groups have a good
affinity to form a coordination bond with Hg2+ ions by
donating electron pair from the functional terminal to the metal ions,
resulting in the fluorescence quenching effect.54 The fluorescence quenching of NCQDs by Hg2+ ions
presumably due to facilitating nonradiative electron/hole recombination/annihilation
through partial electron transfer process in coordinate bond formation.55,56 The fluorescence sensing performance of the nitrogen-doped carbon
quantum dots based on fluorescent quenching was evaluated by adding
different concentrations of Hg2+ (0–100 μM)
into the NCQD solution. As shown in Scheme 2, the fluorescence of NCQDs quenched in the
presence of Hg2+ ion and the fluorescence quenching intensity
depends on the concentration of Hg2+. The fluorescence
spectra in the presence of various concentrations of Hg2+ in NCQDs are shown in Figure 7a. With increasing concentration
of Hg2+, the fluorescence intensity of the NCQDs was gradually
decreased.57 A linear relationship between
the fluorescence quenching factor of NCQDs and the concentration of
Hg2+ was obtained within a linear range of 0.001–1
μM with a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.995, as shown in Figure 7b.

concentrations of Hg2+ and (b) corresponding calibration
curve. (c) Fluorescence quenching response of NCQDs to different metal
ions with the same concentration (1 μM). (d) Specific FL quenching
response of NCQDs to Hg2+ ions in the presence of other

Scheme 2 Scheme Showing Fluorescence Quenching
of NCQDs by Hg2+ Ions
The linear regression equation53 is 3  where I0 and I are the fluorescence
intensities of NCQDs solutions at
465 nm without and in the presence of Hg2+ ions, respectively,
and [Hg2+] is the concentration of Hg2+ ions.
Detection limit determined based on the blank is 5.3 nM (t. σ, n = 9, where σ is the standard
deviation and t is taken from a one-sided Student’s t distribution for n – 1 degrees
of freedom at a 99% confidence level) and precision is 1.32% relative
standard deviation (RSD; 0.01 μM, n = 11).
The limit of quantification for this method is 18.3 nM (10σ, n = 9) at a 99% confidence level.

Selectivity
To
study the selectivity of Hg2+ ions over other competing
cations, 30 μL of 1 × 10–4 M solution
of cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Sn2+, Ba2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Al3+) were added to
NCQD solution in phosphate-buffered solution of pH 7.4 and makeup
to 3 mL with final concentration of 1 μM. Fluorescence spectrum
was recorded after 5 min of addition and compared with the fluorescence
intensity of blank (3 mL of NCQDs in phosphate-buffered solution).
As shown in Figure 7c, the addition of Hg2+ and Fe3+ ions noticeably
reduces the intensity of NCQDs, whereas the effect of other cations
is negligible. To further investigate the interference of the above
cations with Hg2+ ions, 25 μL of 1 × 10–4 M solution of cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Sn2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Al3+) and 30 μL of 1 × 10–4 M of Hg2+ were taken in a cuvette containing
NCQDs and the volume adjusted to 3 mL and then the spectrum was recorded. Figure 7d illustrates that
the presence of cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Sn2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Al3+) with Hg2+ has no effect on the fluorescence sensing
of Hg2+ because the fluorescence decrease is the same as
that for the solution containing only Hg2+. However, the
presence of Fe3+ causes more decrease, although it is insignificant.
Hence, NCQDs can be used for selective fluorescence sensing of Hg2+ ions in aqueous solution.

Real Water Analysis
To evaluate the feasibility of
the fluorescent NCQDs for Hg2+ sensing, different concentrations
of Hg2+ added in water samples were determined by the spike
recovery method, and the results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the recoveries of the
samples were found to be in the range of 95–101% and the RSDs
were less than 5.0%. The results showed that it was an applicable
method for the determination of Hg2+ in water samples.

Cytotoxicity Test and Live Cell Imaging
The feasibility
of NCQDs derived from lemon juice for potential bioimaging applications
was evaluated by the cytotoxicity test through the MTT assay using
human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cells. Results of cytotoxicity
studies performed using various concentrations of NCQDs (0.312–2
mg/mL) are shown in Figure 8. The NCQDs exhibited low cytotoxicity, with cells maintaining
the viability of about 88% for MCF7 cells at a high concentration
of 2 mg/mL after 24 h incubation. The results revealed the low toxicity
and excellent biocompatibility of the prepared NCQDs derived from
lemon juice, which made them a suitable fluorescent probe for bioimaging
application.44

Fluorescence imaging
potential of NCQDs was tested by treating
MCF7 cells with 0.025 mg/mL of NCQDs derived from citrus lemon juice.
Cell images were recorded with confocal microscopy at laser excitations
of 405, 488, and 561 nm. Figure 9 shows the confocal microscopic images of MCF7 cells
after incubation with NCQDs. The obtained bright-field image after
incubation indicates the viability of the cells (Figure 9a). After excitation at 405,
488, and 561 nm, bright blue, green, and red luminescence in the cytoplasm
region was observed, respectively, indicating the excellent cell membrane
permeability of NCQDs.58 The results indicate
that fluorescent, water-soluble NCQDS derived from citrus lemon juice
can be used as an excellent fluorescent bioimaging probe.

Conclusions
A facile, environmentally
green hydrothermal method was used to
synthesize highly photofluorescent, water-soluble nitrogen-doped carbon
quantum dots (NCQDs) using abundantly available fruit, citrus lemon
juice as a carbon source and ethylenediamine as a coreagent. The obtained
NCQDs exhibit high quantum yield, narrow size distribution, highest
fluorescence intensity, good water solubility, excellent stability,
and good resistance to ionic strength and photobleaching. From an
environmental perspective, investigation of the sensing efficiency
of NCQDs for Hg2+ ions in water samples shows that the
material is suitable to develop selective sensors with high accuracy
(LOD = 5.3 nM, LOQ = 18.3 nM) and high precision. From the MTT assay,
we observed that the prepared NCQDs show low cytotoxicity and excellent
biocompatibility. The multicolor living cell imaging of the NCQDs
was investigated, and we conclude that the prepared NCQDs may be used
as an eco-friendly fluorescent nanomaterial for potential in vitro
or in vivo multicolor imaging and sensing applications.
