CK2α and CK2α′
are the two isoforms of the catalytic
subunit of human protein kinase CK2, an important target for cancer
therapy. They have similar, albeit not identical functional and structural
properties, and were occasionally reported to be inhibited with distinct
efficacies by certain ATP-competitive ligands. Here, we present THN27,
an indeno[1,2-b]indole derivative, as a further inhibitor
with basal isoform selectivity. The selectivity disappears when measured
using CK2α/CK2α′ complexes with CK2β, the
regulatory CK2 subunit. Co-crystal structures of THN27 with CK2α
and CK2α′ reveal that subtle differences in the conformational
variability of the interdomain hinge region are correlated with the
observed effect. In the case of CK2α′, a crystallographically
problematic protein so far, this comparative structural analysis required
the development of an experimental strategy that finally enables atomic
resolution structure determinations with ab initio phasing of potentially
any ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor and possibly many non-ATP-competitive
ligands as well bound to CK2α′.

Introduction
Vertebrate genomes
encode two paralogs of the catalytic subunit
of protein kinase CK2 referred to as CK2α and CK2α′.
They are the products of the CSNKA1 and CSNK2A2 genes, which are two
of 517 eukaryotic protein kinase (EPK) genes in Homo
sapiens.1 The knockout
of CK2α in mice prevents the development of viable animals;2 in contrast, knocking out CK2α′
merely leads to infertile males because of severe globozoospermia.3 The main physiological interaction partner of
CK2α and CK2α′ is CK2β, a homodimer that
recruits two catalytic chains to form a CK2α2/α′2β2 holoenzyme.4

CK2 is biomedically relevant in particular for cancer therapy.5 Therefore, it is subject of considerable efforts
to design effective and selective inhibitors,6−9 most of them being ATP competitive.
Currently, with silmitasertib (CX-4945; Chart 1f),9 one such
CK2 inhibitor is part of a clinical phase-2 study (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02128282). CK2 inhibition experiments are typically performed exclusively
with either CK2α or with the CK2α-based holoenzyme, and
the structure determination of enzyme/inhibitor complexes normally
relies on co-crystallization with CK2α rather than CK2α′.
As a consequence, it has been only rarely reported that a compound
showed a significant efficacy difference between the isoforms.10−12 The most comprehensive investigation of this type, which revealed
a general tendency of natural flavonoids to inhibit CK2α′
more strongly than CK2α, was published only recently.12

Results and Discussion
The study we present here originates from a similar feature observed
for a derivative of the indeno[1,2-b]indole scaffold
(Chart 1a,c). Several
indeno[1,2-b]indole-type molecules were described
to be effective CK2 inhibitors13−15 without isoform selectivity.
However, in the case of 5-isopropyl-4-[(prop-2-en-1-yl)oxy]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroindeno[1,2-b]indole-9,10-dione
(THN27; Chart 1c),
we found an approximately 2-fold stronger inhibition effect for CK2α′
(IC50 = 273 nM) than for CK2α (IC50 =
607 nM) (Figure 1a).
The binding of CK2β, meaning catalyzing the kinase reaction
with either a CK2α- or CK2α′-based holoenzyme rather
than the unbound catalytic subunit, balances the difference (Figure 1b), a feature that
was reported for CK2-inhibitory flavonoids as well.12

Figure 1 Differential inhibitory effect of THN27 on CK2α and CK2α′.
(a) Dose-response curves of CK2α (red) and CK2α′
(black) for the inhibition with THN27. (b) Dose-response curves of
the holoenzymes CK2α2β2 (red) and
CK2α′2β2 (black) for the
inhibition with THN27. For each dose-response curve in (a) and (b),
one example out of three replicates is shown. The histograms in the
insets provide averages of all replicates together with the results
of a statistical evaluation of their differences via an unpaired t-test.

This equalizing effect
of CK2β made a project to optimize
the basal isoform selectivity of THN27 not very promising. Therefore,
rather than working out comprehensive structure–activity relationships,
we decided to investigate whether the diacritic binding of THN27 by
the two CK2α paralogs is correlated with structural differences.

On a level of primary structures, the two isoforms are 86% identical
in the canonical EPK catalytic core (Figure 2). In particular at the ATP site, some CK2α
typical bulky side chains such as Val67 or Ile175, which are known
to determine the inhibitory selectivity with respect to other members
of the EPK superfamily17 (gray shadows
in Figure 2), are fully
conserved in CK2α′; the only sequence variation in the
ATP-binding region refers to two residues of the hinge (His114 and
Val115 in CK2α vs. Tyr115 and Ile116 in CK2α′; Figure 2) connecting the
two main structural domains (lobes) of the kinase. This hinge region
often contributes to the binding of cosubstrate or cosubstrate-competitive
molecules via hydrogen and halogen bonds;18,19 however, the polar interactions between ligand and hinge are only
made with main chain atoms. In consequence, an impact of a sequence
variation in the hinge region appears to be not evident, especially
because the first crystallographic analysis of an indeno[1,2-b]indole-type inhibitor, the THN27 similar compound 4p (Chart 1b), with CK2α
and CK2α′ has revealed that no hydrogen bonds between
the hinge backbone and the inhibitor are formed.13

Identical positions are printed with capitals. Regions contributing
to the ATP-binding site are indicated by different colors: the glycine-rich
loop in green, the strand β3 in brown, the interdomain hinge
in red, the catalytic loop in blue, and the magnesium-binding loop
in magenta. Large side chains restricting the space at the ATP site17 are highlighted with gray shadows.

To gain deeper insight into the structural differences
between
CK2α and CK2α′ upon binding of THN27 (Chart 1c), we solved corresponding
co-crystal structures (Table S1, structures
1, 2, and 4). For CK2α, more precisely for the C-terminal truncation
construct CK2α1–335,20 it was comparatively straightforward to determine two complex structures
of acceptable quality. They resulted either from a “high-salt”
(precipitant: 4.1 M NaCl) or from a “low-salt” crystallization
condition (precipitant: 30% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000) (Table S1, structures 1 and 2). Human CK2α,
in contrast to CK2α′ or other CK2α homologs, is
well known for its crystalline polymorphism. It depends among others
on the salt concentration of the crystallization medium and is accompanied
with local conformational changes in the ATP site region;13,19,21 therefore, the use of two different
crystallization media was intended to get a comprehensive structural
picture of THN27 binding similar to the approach recently described
for 4p.13

For crystallization of
CK2α′, we used the point mutant
CK2α′C336S.16,19 Here, we were
faced with a problem described earlier16 that has restricted the CK2α′ structures published
so far to a relatively small number:13,16,19,23,24 CK2α′ crystallizes easily under a variety of conditions
but typically as showers or bundles of rather tiny and essentially
unusable needles (top-left corner of Figure 3a). To some extent, we had overcome this
problem previously by screening various CK2 inhibitors as CK2α′C336S crystallization additives, which had identified 3-(4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)propan-1-ol (MB002; Chart 1e) as the most effective hit.16 For this study, we refined that approach by
several steps of standard micro- and macroseeding and most importantly,
by increasing the lithium chloride content of the crystallization
drop. The optimal LiCl concentration after equilibration was in the
range of 0.7 to 0.9 M. The optimized procedure allowed us to grow
large well-shaped CK2α′/MB002 crystals (top-right corner
of Figure 3a) in a
reproducible way.

Figure 3 General strategy to determine atomic resolution ab initio
structures
of CK2α′ complexes with ATP-competitive inhibitors. (a)
Outline of the procedure with the CK2α′/MB002 structure
as primary result. The replacement inhibitors: (b) THN27, (c) AR18,
and (d) CX-4945. For comparison, structures of CK2α′
with the indeno[1,2-b]indole-type inhibitor 4p13 (b, c) or of CK2α with CX-494522 (d) were overlaid. 4p and CX-4945 are drawn with black
C-atoms. The four inhibitors are displayed in their final electron
densities with cutoff levels of 1.5 σ for (a), (b), (d) or 1.0
σ for (c).

These CK2α′/MB002
crystals are most valuable tools
to determine high-quality CK2α′ complex structures because
of a number of properties: (i) their diffraction power is excellent
with standard synchrotron beamlines leading reliably to diffraction
data sets of 1.0 ± 0.1 Å resolution as shown in this study
(Table S1), (ii) this high resolution enables
ab initio structure determination, thus avoiding any model bias from
known CK2α or CK2α′ structures, for example, all
four CK2α′ structures of this study (Table S1, structures 3–6) were solved via ab initio
phasing, (iii) the crystals are reasonably robust and tolerate transfer
and soaking steps fairly well, (iv) the ATP site is fully accessible
in the crystal packing, which permits to replace the original MB002
inhibitor by exhaustive ligand exchange; because of the size of the
crystals, the penetration of colored inhibitors such as THN27 to the
center of the crystal body is easily observable under a microscope,
which provides a preliminary indication of binding; whether this binding
is specific that must be validated by a difference fourier map or,
as done in this study, by an electron density calculated after ab
initio phasing, and (v) with about 250 μm in each dimension
(top-right corner of Figure 3a), the crystals are not at their limit. Rather, larger CK2α′/inhibitor
crystals can be grown in the indicated way up to a size suitable for
neutron diffraction studies. Neutron diffraction enables the experimental
determination of precise hydrogen atom positions, which are potentially
beneficial for the in silico design and optimization of CK2 inhibitors.

To test the power of the procedure, we determined CK2α′
co-crystal structures not only with the MB002 ligand and with our
selective target molecule THN27 but also with two inhibitors of either
higher or lower affinity. The latter was the indeno[1,2-b]indole-type compound AR18 with a large substituent at ring C instead
of ring A (Chart 1d).
This kind of variation of the indeno[1,2-b]indole
framework is an efficient way to weaken the affinity to CK2 while
simultaneously improving the binding to a former off target, the breast
cancer resistance protein ABCG2, which is an ABC half transporter
overexpressed in breast cancer cells.28 AR18 is an intermediate of these polypharmacology efforts. As a
high-affinity ligand, we chose the benchmark CK2-inhibitor CX-49459 (Chart 1f) for which no CK2α′ structure is available
so far. Whereas CX-4945 replaces MB002 completely within 2 days of
crystal soaking (Figure 3), an increasing degree of occupation with soaking time could be
observed for AR18 and THN27. After 7 days, it was more than 90% for
either AR18 or THN27, leaving only small amounts of residual electron
density that did not disturb the structure refinement later. In each
of the three cases, a reference structure determined by co-crystallization
rather than soaking and ligand exchange was superimposed: for CX-4945,
a complex structure with CK2α (3NGA),22 and for AR18 and for THN27, the CK2α′ structure 5OOI13 containing the indeno[1,2-b]indole-type inhibitor
4p, which differs from THN27 by two additional methyl groups at the
ring A substituent (Chart 1b). These overlays show close coincidences of the bound inhibitors
(Figure 3d) or at least
their central scaffolds (Figure 3b,c). Thus, the replacement procedure outlined in Figure 3 leads to reliable
results, and it is a promising and generally applicable strategy to
determine atomic resolution structures of CK2α′ complexes
with essentially any ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor and possibly with
further small molecule ligands of CK2.

The CK2α′/MB002
structure is the highest-resolved
X-ray structure of a protein kinase published to date. One of its
remarkable details not visible in a lower resolution structure of
this complex (3OFM)16 is a pairwise ambiguity
of the side chains of Phe122 and Tyr126 in the small helix αD.
Each of them can adopt an “out”- or an “in”-conformation.
This leads to the combinations Phe122-out/Tyr126-in (blue electron
density in Figure 4a), which is prevailing in the CK2α′/MB002 structure,
or Phe122-in/Tyr126-out (green electron density in Figure 4a), which is less occupied.
The respective in-rotamer of the side chains overlaps slightly with
the so-called “αD pocket”. This is an allosteric
site so far exclusively known from CK2α where it can be exploited
for the design of highly selective CK2 inhibitors.25,29 Some of them are bivalent molecules such as CAM4066 (Figure 4a) with an anchor group for
the ATP site and a second one for the αD pocket.

Figure 4 Structural observations
in complexes of CK2α′ and
CK2α with MB002 and THN27. (a) Pairwise ambiguity of the helix
αD residues Phe122 and Tyr126 in the CK2α′/MB002
complex, visible by alternate side chain conformations in direct vicinity
of the αD pocket. The two alternate rotamers of Phe122 and Tyr
126 are embedded in either green or blue electron densities (cutoff
level 1 σ). The αD pocket is indicated by the bivalent
CK2 inhibitor CAM406625 (PDB 5CU4), which
is drawn with transparent spheres. The indeno[1,2-b]indole-type inhibitors (b) THN27 and (c) 4p bound to CK2α′
(green C-atoms), to low-salt CK2α (magenta-colored C-atoms)
and to high-salt CK2α (black C-atoms), are drawn after superimposition
of the enzyme matrices. The hydrogen bond networks around two conserved
water molecules26 typical for the binding
of indeno[1,2-b]indole-type inhibitors13 are indicated by magenta-colored dotted lines.
The two black dotted lines in the high-salt CK2α/THN27 complex
(b) show the remaining hydrogen bonds of THN27 after an H-bond loss
after rotation of the inhibitor. (d) 2D-projection (LIGPLOT)27 of the noncovalent interactions between THN27
and either CK2α′ (THN27 with green C-atoms) or CK2α
(high-salt structure; THN27 with magenta-colored C-atoms). (e) Peptide
switches (highlighted by gray parallelograms) and side chain movements
at His115 and Val116 of CK2α documented by final electron density
(cutoff level 1 σ) lead to a novel hinge conformation in the
high-salt CK2α/THN27 complex.

The occupation of the αD pocket by a small molecule
requires
that neither Phe121 nor Tyr125 (the CK2α equivalents of Phe122
and Tyr126 in CK2α′) are directed inward. In CK2α,
this can be achieved either by out-conformations of those side chains
or by backbone rearrangements in the helix αD region or by combinations
of these as exemplified by the CK2α structure 5CS625 (black ribbon in Figure 4a). The essential hinge/helix αD flexibility
required for accessibility of the αD pocket is known for a long
time for CK2α.21,30,31 It was confirmed by in silico simulations with CK2α,32,33 but it was never observed in the case of CK2α′ where
the hinge/helix αD backbones of available structures are rigid
and coincide in a fairly narrow range. This was shown recently for
seven CK2α′ chains,13 and
it is confirmed here for the four high-resolution CK2α′
structures of this study (Figure 4a). Does this mean that in CK2α′, in contrast
to CK2α, the αD pocket is inaccessible for inhibitory
compounds? Is therefore the αD pocket rather than the ATP site
the key region for the design of isoform selective CK2 inhibitors?
These questions must remain open at the moment, but it is at least
remarkable in this context that the CK2α′/MB002 structure
of this work provides the first indication that, irrespective of a
rigid helix αD backbone, a limited side chain flexibility next
to the αD pocket exists (Figure 4a). Whether this flexibility is sufficient to permit
an out/out-rotamer combination of the Phe122/Tyr126 couple and thus
to open the αD pocket of CK2α′ for suitable small
molecules, this must be clarified by enzymological and crystallographic
experiments.

To detect structural reasons for the conspicuous
differential inhibitory
efficacy of THN27 (Figure 1a), we compared the three THN27 complex structures of this
work (Table S1, structures 1, 2, and 4)
among each other (Figure 4b) and with three published CK2α/CK2α′
structures in complex with 4p (Figure 4c).13 Overall, a remarkable
“oxygen-in”/“hydrophobic-out” binding
mode that was recently described for 4p13 is confirmed by THN27 (and by AR18 as well): whereas the inhibitor
does not form any hydrogen bond with the hinge region, its two ketonic
oxo groups (Chart 1c) participate in a solvent inaccessible hydrogen bond network that
involves two conserved water molecules26 (front and back water in Figure 4b–d) as well as Lys69 and Glu82, two residues
conserved likewise (Figure 4b,c).

4p serves as a reference here because its orientation
within the
ATP site and its anchoring by three H-bonds is maintained in detail
(Figure 4c), irrespective
of the harboring enzyme isoform, the crystallization conditions (high
or low salt) and the crystal packing; even structural variations of
the neighboring hinge/helix αD region, which can occur if CK2α
serves as the host enzyme,21 have no impact
on 4p binding. The coordination of THN27, however, is significantly
more variable (Figure 4b) in the CK2α′/THN27 and in the low-salt CK2α/THN27
complex (green- and magenta-colored C-atoms in Figure 4b); the THN27 binding is equivalent to the
4p complexes in Figure 4c, whereas in its high-salt structure with CK2α (black C-atoms
in Figure 4b), THN27
is significantly rotated outward. This means that only two of its
originally three H-bonds remain (black dotted lines in Figure 4b). This loss of one H-bond
is schematically depicted in Figure 4d.

In parallel to this, in direct proximity to
the bound THN27 inhibitor,
a novel conformation of the interdomain hinge that was never observed
before for CK2α was trapped in the high-salt CK2α/THN27
structure. This is a remarkable feature against the following background:
the aforementioned conformational flexibility of the hinge/helix αD
region of human CK2α21,25,30,31 mainly refers to the helix αD,
whereas the interdomain hinge in a strict sense (red in Figure 2) usually accompanies these
adaptations by moving as a rigid group of low internal dynamics. The
standard conformation of the hinge is found in the high-salt CK2α/4p
complex, in the CK2α′/THN27 complex (black and magenta-colored
C-atoms in Figure 4e), and in all other structures of this study with one exception.
This exception is the high-salt CK2α/THN27 structure (green
C-atoms in Figure 4e) where unprecedented peptide switches accompanied with large shifts
and reorientations of the enclosed side chains can be observed. A
comparison of the two high-salt CK2α structures suggests that
these conspicuous structural changes are not enforced by the high
salt concentration; rather, they seem to reflect subtle impacts of
the nearby THN27 ligand. Remarkably, this conformational variability
concerns His115 and Val116 (Figure 4e), that is, exactly those two residues that make up
the only sequence differences between CK2α and CK2α′
in the ATP site neighborhood (Figure 2). Tyr116 and Ile117, the CK2α′ equivalents,
are significantly larger, less flexible, and thus presumably stabilizing
factors of the standard hinge conformation as it was observed in CK2α′
structures so far exclusively.

In summary, with CK2α′
as a docking partner, THN27
encounters a conformationally stable enzyme environment with a binding
site preformed to coordinate the compound in the typical indeno[1,2-b]indole binding mode known from 4p.13 The CK2α isoform, however, is conformationally dynamic
in the hinge/helix αD region as an essential part of the ATP
site environment and does not provide a preformed conformation for
THN27 binding. Thus, either structural adaptations of CK2α are
necessary for optimal THN27 binding or THN27 partially binds in a
nonoptimal mode, that is, with a reduced number of enzyme-inhibitor
H-bonds (Figure 4d).
These structural features correlate well with the higher inhibitory
impact of THN27 on CK2α′ than that on CK2α, which
we observed (Figure 1a) and was reported for certain inhibitory benzimidazole derivatives11 and for natural flavonoid inhibitors12 as well.

However, it seems to be unlikely
that this slight preference of
THN27 for CK2α′ can be extended toward a CK2 inhibitor
with strong isoform selectivity. The reason is that CK2β binding
to CK2α′ and CK2α removes the IC50 difference
of THN27 (Figure 1b)
as reported similarly for flavonoid-type CK2 inhibitors12 and that the CK2β-bound form of CK2α/CK2α′
is the dominating CK2 entity in cells.34 Most probably, CK2β exerts this equalizing effect by stabilization
of the hinge conformation. Comparative structural analyses of significant
CK2α2β2- and CK2α′2β2-holoenzyme complexes are required to validate
this hypothesis.
