Previous studies
have shown that many kinds of microorganisms,
including bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, can convert parent
ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides. However, most microorganisms
used for ginsenoside transformations may not be safe for food consumption
and drug development. In this study, 24 edible and medicinal mushrooms
were screened by high-performance liquid chromatography analyses for
their ability to microbiologically transform protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type
ginsenosides. We observed that the degradation of ginsenosides by Schizophyllum commune was inhibited by high concentrations
of sugar in the culture medium. However, the inhibition was avoided
by maintaining sugar concentration below 15 g L–1. S. commune showed a strong ability
to convert PPD-type ginsenosides (Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd) into minor ginsenosides (F2, C–O, C–Y,
C–Mc1, C–Mc, and C–K). The production
and bioconversion rates of minor ginsenosides were significantly higher
than those previously reported by food microorganisms. The fermentation
process is efficient, nontoxic, eco-friendly, and economical, and
the required biotransformation systems are readily available. This
is the first report about the biotransformation of major ginsenosides
into minor ginsenosides through fermentation by edible and medicinal
mushrooms. Our results provide a green biodegradation strategy in
transformation of ginsenosides using edible and medicinal mushrooms.

==== Body
Introduction
Ginsenosides are the
major active constituents in Asian ginseng,
American ginseng, and Notoginseng and have been demonstrated to have
a wide range of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory,
antidiabetic, antifatigue, antioxidant, antiobesity, and antitumor
activities.1−4 They have been widely used in functional food, traditional medicine,
and cosmetics industries with high economic value. Currently, more
than 100 ginsenosides have been identified, isolated, and characterized.4,5 According to the sugar moieties at the C-3, -6, and -20 position
of sapogenins, major ginsenosides can be classified into protopanaxadiol
(PPD)-type ginsenosides (e.g., Rb1, Rc, Rb2,
and Rd) and propanaxatriol-type ginsenosides (e.g., Rg1 and Re). They make up about 90% of the total ginsenosides in ginseng
species.5 Minor ginsenosides, present at
low concentrations in ginseng, include Rg3, Rh1, Rh2, F2, compound K, compound Mc, and compound
Y. These compounds have attracted great interest because they are
readily absorbed into the bloodstream, and these minor ginsenosides
have better pharmacological activities than the major ginsenosides.6−9

Microbial transformation is considered to be the most promising
method for the preparation of minor ginsenosides. Previous studies
have shown that many kinds of microorganisms can convert major ginsenosides
into minor ginsenosides, including bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous
fungi.10,11 However, many microorganisms can produce
toxic compounds such as biogenic amines, botulinum neurotoxins, aflatoxins,
zearalenone, fumonisins, and ochratoxins. These toxins are of great
concern due to their acute and long-term toxic, carcinogenic, nephrotoxic,
mutagenic, teratogenic, hepatotoxic, and immunosuppressive effects.12,13 Therefore, most microorganisms used for ginsenoside transformations
are not safe for food consumption and drug development.

The
human intestinal bacteria can transform ginsenosides into more
active forms and can be used safely in a variety of foods.14−17 However, human intestinal bacteria require an expensive medium and
exhibit low yield and poor productivity. In addition, the fact that
many filamentous fungi have been given generally regarded as safe
(GRAS) status in many industrial applications could be questioned
by mycotoxin production. For example, Aspergillus niger is one of the most important industrial filamentous fungal species
used in biotechnology, where it is studied extensively for its ability
to transform natural products. However, research data showed that A. niger has the potential to produce two groups
of potentially carcinogenic mycotoxins.18−21 Thus, it is a great challenge
to establish green biotransformation methods to identify the appropriate
microorganism for ginsenoside biotransformation.

Mushrooms are
defined as macrofungi with distinctive and visible
fruiting bodies that may grow above or below ground. There are at
least 15 000 species of fungi that can be considered as mushrooms,
and at least 2000 species are edible and medicinal.22 Recently, edible and medicinal mushrooms have been widely
consumed in many countries as food, nutraceuticals, and medicine.
Their nutritional and health benefits come from their high protein,
fiber, vitamin, and mineral contents, low-fat level, and bioactive
secondary metabolites.23,24 Compared with extensively studied
bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, edible and medicinal mushrooms
are safely used as edible microorganisms for food consumption and
drug development. The required biotransformation systems are readily
available, and the fermentation process is green, nontoxic, eco-friendly,
and economical. In addition, edible and medicinal mushrooms play a
very important role in many biotechnological processes, such as biodegradation
of raw plant materials, bioremediation of soil, and industrial waters,
as well as biopulping and biobleaching of paper pulp.25,26 However, very little work has been carried out on the biotransformation
of ginsenosides by edible and medicinal mushrooms.

The objective
of this work was to study the role of edible and
medicinal mushrooms in ginsenoside biotransformation. Special attention
has been paid to their metabolic patterns and biotransformation pathways.
The results highlight an important practical application of the green
ginsenoside biotransformation strategy using edible and medicinal
mushrooms.

Results and Discussion
Edible and Medicinal Mushroom Screening
In this study,
24 edible and medicinal mushrooms were screened for the ability to
convert ginsenosides. Among the cultures screened, Schizophyllum commune showed a strong ability to
convert ginsenosides into a less polar metabolite. Therefore, this
fungus was selected for ginsenoside biotransformation. S. commune is a popular edible and medicinal mushroom
and has been demonstrated to have various pharmacological properties,
such as antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and antitumor activities.27−29S. commune is known to produce a
variety of hydrolytic enzymes, such as cellulase, xylanase, and β-glucosidase.30,31 It has been studied for different industrial applications in areas
like food, pharmacology, agro-industry, bioprocessing, and environmental
technology. However, S. commune has
rarely been investigated for the biotransformation of ginsenosides.

Identification of Metabolites
In recent years, high-performance
liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESIMS)
has been extensively used for the determination of ginsenoside structure.
In this study, the metabolites of ginsenosides Rb1, Rc,
Rb2, and Rd by S. commune were identified according to the standards and HPLC-ESIMS ion fragments.
As shown in Figure S1, the [M –
H]− ion at m/z = 945 was observed for compound 2, which confirmed its molecular
mass as 946 Da. The major fragment ions at m/z 783[M – H – Glc]−, 621[M
– H – 2Glc]−, and 459[M – H
– 3Glc]− can be assigned to glycosidic cleavage
fragments. The m/z = 459 ion corresponded
to the characteristic ion of PPD-type aglycone. The MS of compounds
3 and 4 gave m/z of 783 and 621
as the deprotonated molecular ion [M – H]−, which confirmed the molecular mass to be 784 and 622, respectively.
The metabolites corresponding to compounds 2, 3, and 4 were identified
as Rd, F2, and C–K, respectively, by comparing the
mass spectra and retention times with those of reference compounds.
Similarly, the metabolites corresponding to compounds 6, 7, 9, and
10 were identified as C–Mc1, C–Mc, C–O,
and C–Y, respectively. Characteristic fragment ions of ginsenoside
are summarized in Table 1.

Effects of Glucose Concentration on Ginsenoside Biotransformation
To study the effect of the initial glucose concentration on PPD-type
ginsenoside (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd) biotransformations,
various concentrations of glucose (ranging from 5 to 50 g L–1) were employed in the culture medium. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, when S. commune was grown in fermentation
medium containing 25–50 g L–1 glucose, after
4 days of fermentation, only ginsenoside Rb1 was converted
into Rd, whereas ginsenosides Rb2, Rc, and Rd did not undergo
any degradation. In contrast, ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd were converted to minor ginsenosides when the
glucose concentration was in the range of 5–15 g L–1. These results indicate that the glucose level was the determining
factor for the ginsenoside bioconversion by S. commune. The high glucose concentrations inhibited degradation of ginsenosides
Rb2, Rc, and Rd, whereas low glucose concentrations promoted
the degradation of these ginsenosides.

Figure 1 HPLC profile of the metabolites
of ginsenosides (A) Rb1, (B) Rd, (C) Rc, and (D) Rb2 converted by S. commune with
liquid medium containing 15 and 30
g L–1 glucose. Peak numbers: (1) Rb1,
(2) Rd, (3) F2, (4) compound K, (5) Rc, (6) compound Mc1, (7) compound Mc, (8) Rb2, (9) compound O, and
(10) compound Y. Peaks were identified using both authentic standards
and LC-ESIMS.

of ginsenosides (A) Rb1, (B) Rd, (C) Rc, and (D) Rb2 by S. commune with liquid
medium containing 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, and 50 g L–1 glucose.

Table S1 shows the mean biomass accumulation
of S. commune grown in the fermentation
medium containing 5, 15, and 30 g L–1 glucose or
a combination of both glucose and ginsenoside Rb1 (5 g
L–1). When S. commune was grown in fermentation medium containing 5 or 15 g L–1 glucose, the mycelial biomass in the presence of ginsenoside Rb1 was higher than in the absence of ginsenoside Rb1. When S. commune was grown in fermentation
medium containing 30 g L–1 glucose, the mycelial
biomass was not statistically different between cultures grown in
the presence and absence of ginsenoside Rb1 media. It was
suggested that S. commune may use the
sugars hydrolyzed from ginsenosides as a carbon source. Yousef and
Bernards investigated and reported the metabolism of ginsenosides
by the ginseng root pathogen Pythium irregulare.32 The results showed that ginsenosides
could significantly promote the in vitro growth of P. irregulare. The growth of P. irregulare in the presence of ginsenosides was more than 2-fold of that in
the control group (no ginsenosides).

Effects of Different Carbon
Sources on Ginsenoside Biotransformation
The effects of different
carbon sources on the conversion of ginsenosides
were also investigated. Each carbon source (glucose, lactose, maltose,
sucrose, and starch) was added to the initial medium at a concentration
of 15 or 30 g L–1. Figure 3 shows that the effects of lactose, maltose,
sucrose, and starch on the ginsenoside biotransformation were the
same as the effects of glucose. The PPD-type ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd) could be degraded into minor
ginsenosides by S. commune with liquid
medium containing 15 g L–1 sugar. However, the degradation
of ginsenosides Rb2, Rc, and Rd did not occur using 30
g L–1 sugar as the sole carbon source. This phenomenon
is similar to carbon catabolite repression (CCR). CCR is a key regulatory
system found in most microorganisms that ensures preferential utilization
of energy-efficient carbon sources. CCR has been sometimes called
a glucose effect because the presence of glucose often prevents the
use of other carbon sources. This is usually achieved through the
inhibition of expression of genes encoding for enzymes involved in
the catabolism of nonglucose carbon sources.33 Therefore, it seemed that the degradation of ginsenosides by S. commune can be regulated by CCR.

carbon sources on biotransformation of ginsenosides
(A) Rb1, (B) Rd, (C) Rc, and (D) Rb2 by S. commune with liquid medium containing 15 and 30
g L–1 sugar.

Effects of Nitrogen Sources and Metal Ions on Ginsenoside Biotransformation
Nitrogen sources and metal ions are other two essential components
for the growth and metabolism of microorganisms. Hence, we selected
nitrogen sources and metal ions to investigate their influence on
the biotransformation of ginsenosides. As shown in Figures S2 and S3, our results indicated that yeast powder
was the most favorable for ginsenoside transformation in the fermentation
medium with 15 g L–1 glucose as the carbon source.
Out of all of the examined metal ions, MgSO4 and KH2PO4 most significantly increased ginsenoside bioconversion.
However, neither the nitrogen source nor the metal ion had an effect
on the degradation of ginsenosides Rb2, Rc, and Rd when S. commune was cultured in fermentation medium containing
30 g L–1 glucose as the sole carbon source. These
results indicate that the nitrogen sources and metal ions were not
the determining factors for the ginsenoside bioconversion by S. commune.

Transformation Pathways of Ginsenosides and
Glucose Utilization
The profiles of glucose utilization and
ginsenoside transformation
during the fermentation processes are shown in Figure 4. When S. commune was cultured in fermentation medium containing 15 g L–1 glucose, the glucose was quickly utilized and almost completely
metabolized within 96 h of fermentation. Using ginsenoside Rb1 as a substrate of S. commune, three transformation products, Rd, F2, and C–K,
were detected throughout the transformation period. The results are
presented in Figure 4A. Ginsenoside Rb1 was gradually transformed into Rd during
0–48 h, and ginsenosides F2 and C–K were
produced very weakly. From 48 to 96 h of incubation, the content of
ginsenoside Rb1 decreased rapidly. Ginsenoside Rd quickly
approached its maximum production as long as the content of ginsenoside
F2 and C–K accumulated gradually. Then, the amount
of Rd decreased continuously after 96 h, leading to a significant
increase in the amount of F2. These results indicate that
F2 is the main transformation product of ginsenoside Rb1 and the biotransformation pathway of Rb1 by S. commune can be traced as follows: Rb1 → Rd → F2 → C–K (Figure 5A). However, the
biotransformation pathway of Rb1 by S. commune was different from that by human gut bacteria. The intestinal bacteria
can hydrolyze the ginsenoside Rb1 in two different pathways:
Rb1 → G–XVII → G–LXXV →
C–K and Rb1 → Rd → F2 →
C–K.14 When ginsenoside Rd was tested
as substrate of S. commune, the transformation
products, F2 and C–K, were detected in the metabolites
throughout the transformation period (Figure 4C). A similar result suggested that the transformation
pathway of Rd was Rd → F2 → C–K.

Figure 5 Biotransformation
pathways of ginsenosides (A) Rb1,
(B) Rb2, and (C) Rc by S. commune.

When ginsenoside Rc was used as
a substrate, two major transformation
products, C–Mc1 and C–Mc, were detected.
As shown in Figure 4E, C–Mc1 and C–Mc were observed during 0–48
h and maintained at a low level, then increased gradually from 48
h until the end of the experimental period. The biotransformation
pathway of Rc was Rc → C–Mc1 → C–Mc
(Figure 5B). Ginsenoside
C–Mc is the main transformation product of ginsenoside Rc.
For ginsenoside Rb2, two major transformation products,
C–O and C–Y, were detected. As shown in Figure 4G, the level of Rb2 decreased gradually throughout the transformation period. The amount
of C–O and C–Y was relatively low during the first 48
h of incubation and then increased continuously from 48 h until the
end of the experimental period. Our results showed that C–Y
was the main transformation product of Rb2 and the biotransformation
pathway of Rb2 can be traced as follows: Rb2 → C–O → C–Y (Figure 5C). The biotransformation pathways of Rb2 and Rc by S. commune were
also different from that by human gut bacteria. The intestinal bacteria
can transform the ginsenosides Rb2 and Rc with the pathway
Rb2 → C–O → C–Y → C–K
and Rc → C–Mc1 → C–Mc →
C–K.15 However, S.
commune is not able to hydrolyze the ginsenosides
Rb2 and Rc to C–K.

When S.
commune was grown in fermentation
medium containing 30 g L–1 glucose, the glucose
was rapidly utilized within 96 h of incubation, then metabolized slowly
from 96 h until the end of the experimental period. Under high levels
of glucose, ginsenoside Rb1 (Figure 4B) was gradually converted into Rd within
144 h of incubation, whereas the degradation of Rd (Figure 4D), Rc (Figure 4F), and Rb2 (Figure 4H) was not observed. These
results indicate that the hydrolysis of the terminal glucose residues
at C-20 of Rb1 was not affected by glucose levels, but
the terminal and inner glucose residues at the C-3 of Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd were inhibited by the high concentration
of glucose. In addition, under the low glucose levels, the glucose
and protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd) were simultaneously consumed by S. commune. However, the rate of glucose consumption was always higher than
that of ginsenosides.

CCR is a universal regulatory phenomenon
in many microorganisms.
However, there are exceptions. For some pathogenic bacteria, such
as Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, glucose is only a secondary
carbon source, which is referred to as reverse CCR.34,35 Another peculiarity is the co-fermentation of glucose and other
carbon sources that occurs in Corynebacterium glutamicum and engineered Escherichia coli,
although this co-fermentation is highly regulated.36,37 In our work, the degradation of ginsenosides Rb2, Rc,
and Rd was inhibited by various carbon sources at high concentrations.
The inhibition was avoided by maintaining sugar concentration below
15 g L–1. In addition, the utilization of sugar
and biotransformation of ginsenosides Rb1 to Rd by S. commune occur simultaneously. The reason and mechanism
behind these phenomena warrant further studies.

Optimization
of Substrate Concentration and Cosolvent on Minor
Ginsenoside Yield
The effect of different ginsenoside (Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd) concentrations on the biotransformation
for the production of minor ginsenosides was investigated under optimized
culture conditions. The contents of minor ginsenosides in the media
were detected by HPLC. As shown in Figure 6A, the bioconversion rate declined gradually
following a rise in the ginsenoside concentration from 2.5 to 5 g
L–1and decreased rapidly above this range. The results
indicate that high ginsenoside concentration was not beneficial for
the production of minor ginsenosides; it may be the poor aqueous solubility
of ginsenoside that inhibited its utility by S. commune.

Figure 6 Effects of substrate concentration and cosolvent on ginsenoside
degradation by S. commune. (A) Effect
of different substrate concentrations. (B) Effect of various cosolvents.

Usually, a cosolvent can improve the aqueous solubility
of ginsenoside
substrates and promote the permeability of cell membrane and increase
the bioconversion efficiency.38 Therefore,
the effects of various cosolvents on the ginsenoside biotransformation
were investigated in this study. As shown in Figure 6B, among the five different cosolvents, Tween
80 was found to be the optimal cosolvent to improve the ginsenoside
solubility and enhance the production of minor ginsenosides. When
the fermentation medium contained 5 g L–1 substrate
and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80, the bioconversion rates of ginsenosides Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd were more than 90%. The maximum
yields of ginsenosides F2, C–Y, and C–Mc
were raised to 75.2, 62.7, and 64.9%, respectively. The production
and bioconversion rates were significantly higher than those previously
reported by food microorganisms.16,17,39

Effects of Glucose Concentration on Ginsenoside
Biotransformation
by Various Edible and Medicinal Mushrooms
On the basis of
the experimental results, we further investigated the effect of initial
glucose concentration on the ginsenoside biotransformation by various
edible and medicinal mushrooms. Our results showed that many edible
and medicinal mushrooms, including Ganoderma lucidum, Hericium erinaceus, Pleurotus ostreatus, Grifola frondosa, and Flammulina velutiper, were only
able to convert ginsenoside Rb1 to Rd, which was not affected
by sugar concentration. It has been shown that ginsenoside Rd possesses
many pharmacological activities.40−42 However, the concentration
of ginsenoside Rd is extremely low in most natural ginseng plants.
Thus, many studies have been aimed at biotransformation of major ginsenosides
(Rb1, Rb2, and Rc) to pharmacologically active
Rd using enzymes or microorganisms.10 However,
ginsenoside Rd is just an intermediate in the reaction and can further
be transformed into other compounds. This leads to a low yield and
bioconversion rate of ginsenoside Rd. Thus, edible and medicinal mushrooms
are also an effective and green ginsenoside Rd producer.

Conclusions
In summary, this study investigated the role of edible and medicinal
mushrooms in ginsenoside biotransformation. A total of 24 edible and
medicinal mushrooms were selected and screened for their ability to
microbiologically transform ginsenosides by HPLC analyses. Our results
showed that the degradation of ginsenosides by S. commune was inhibited by high concentrations of sugar. However, the inhibition
was avoided by maintaining sugar concentration below 15 g L–1. S. commune showed a strong ability
to convert ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides. We found that S. commune may use the sugars hydrolyzed from ginsenosides
as a carbon source. Under the low glucose levels, the glucose and
ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd) were simultaneously
consumed by S. commune. The production
and bioconversion rates were significantly higher than those previously
reported by food microorganisms. In addition, many edible and medicinal
mushrooms were only able to convert ginsenoside Rb1 to
Rd, which was not affected by the concentration of sugar. Thus, edible
and medicinal mushrooms are also an effective and green ginsenoside
Rd producer. This is the first report about the biotransformation
of major ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides through fermentation
by edible and medicinal mushrooms. The results indicate that edible
and medicinal mushrooms would be potential food microorganisms for
obtaining minor ginsenosides.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Ginsenosides
Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rg1, F2, 20S-Rg3,
20R-Rg3, Rh2, and C–K were obtained from
Norman Bethune College of Medicine, Jilin University (Changchun, China).
Ginsenosides C–O, C–Y, C–Mc, and C–Mc1 were purchased from Dalian Green Bio Co Ltd (Dalian, China).
Acetonitrile and methanol of HPLC grade were from Fisher (Fisher Scientific).
Water was purified by a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). All
other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade.

Microorganisms
and Growth Conditions
A total of 24
mushroom species were obtained from the Engineering Research Center
of Chinese Ministry of Education for Edible and Medicinal Fungi, Jilin
Agricultural University (Jilin, China). They were stored at 4 °C
on potato dextrose agar slants and subcultured once a month. The freshly
inoculated slant was incubated at 25 °C for 7 days before use.
The fermentation medium for the flask culture consisted of the following
components: 15 g of glucose, 3 g of yeast powder, 1 g of KH2PO4, and 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O in 1 L of distilled water. Fermentations were carried out in 250
mL shake flasks on a rotary shaker (160 rpm) at 28 °C for 7 d.
All media were sterilized at 121 °C for 30 min.

Screening of
Microorganisms
Preliminary screening was
performed in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 mL of fermentation
medium and 50 mg of protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides. The flasks
were placed on a rotary shaker operating at 160 rpm at 28 °C.
After 7 days of incubation, the ginsenosides were extracted three
times by sonification with aqueous saturated n-BuOH
for 20 min. The n-BuOH extract was concentrated under
reduced pressure to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in methanol
and then analyzed by HPLC-UV.

Effects of Glucose Concentration
To study the effect
of glucose concentration on ginsenoside transformation, the different
concentrations of glucose (ranging from 5 to 50 g L–1) in the initial culture medium were tested. The biotransformation
medium was composed of 3 g L–1 yeast powder, 1 g
L–1 KH2PO4, and 0.5 g L–1 MgSO4·7H2O and a certain
initial concentration of glucose as investigated. Fermentation was
carried out on a rotary shaker (160 rpm) at 28 °C. After 2 d
of culture, 2 mL of the substrate solution was added to each shake
flask, and then the initial concentration of ginsenoside in the culture
medium was diluted to 5 g L–1. Incubation was then
allowed to proceed for 5 d. Finally, the ginsenosides were extracted
by n-BuOH and analyzed by HPLC-UV.

Effects of
Different Carbon Sources
Glucose, sucrose,
maltose, lactose, and soluble starch were selected as alternative
carbon sources in the fermentation medium to investigate influences
on the ginsenoside biotransformation. The concentration of each carbohydrate
as a sole carbon source in the culture medium was 15 or 30 g L–1 in these experiments. The biotransformation medium
was composed of 3 g L–1 yeast powder, 1 g L–1 KH2PO4, and 0.5 g L–1 MgSO4·7H2O and a certain initial concentration
of sugar (glucose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, or soluble starch) as
investigated. The other fermentation conditions were the same as above.

Effects of Nitrogen Sources
The concentrations of 3
g L–1 yeast powder, soybean powder, peptone, corn
steep powder, NaNO3, and (NH4)2SO4 were selected as alternative nitrogen sources in the fermentation
medium to investigate influences on the ginsenoside biotransformation.
The biotransformation medium was composed of 15 or 30 g L–1 glucose, 1 g L–1 KH2PO4,
and 0.5 g L–1 MgSO4·7H2O and an alternative nitrogen source (yeast powder, soybean powder,
peptone, corn steep powder, NaNO3 or (NH4)2SO4). The other fermentation conditions were the
same as above.

Effects of Metal Ions
The concentrations
of 1.5 g L–1 KH2PO4, NaH2PO4, CaCl2, MgSO4·7H2O,
FeSO4, ZnSO4, and CuSO4 were selected
as alternative metal ions in the fermentation medium to investigate
influences on the ginsenoside biotransformation. The biotransformation
medium was composed of 15 or 30 g L–1 glucose, 3
g L–1 yeast powder, and an alternative metal ion
(KH2PO4, NaH2PO4, CaCl2, MgSO4·7H2O, FeSO4,
ZnSO4, or CuSO4). The other fermentation conditions
were the same as above.

Biotransformation Pathway and Glucose Utilization
Ginsenosides
Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd were dissolved in a 100
mL shake flask containing 30 mL fermentation medium. The initial concentration
of each ginsenoside in the medium was diluted to 5 g L–1. Incubation was then allowed to proceed for 0–144 h. The
dynamic profiles of the ginsenoside biotransformation and glucose
utilization were monitored during the biotransformation process.

Effects of Substrate Concentration and Cosolvent
The
effect of initial ginsenoside concentration on the biotransformation
for production of minor ginsenosides by S. commune was investigated with its levels of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 g L–1. Based on the above initial substrate concentration
experiment result, the effect of five different cosolvents (glycerol,
Tween 80, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, and methanol) on the ginsenoside
biotransformation was also investigated.

Analytical Methods
Ginsenoside analysis was carried
out on an LC-20A liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with
two LC-20AT pumps and an SPD-20A UV/Vis detector. Samples were separated
on a Cosmosil C18 reverse-phase silica column (5 μm, 250 ×
4.6 mm2) at 25 °C using acetonitrile (solvent A) and
water (solvent B). A gradient elution program was performed according
to the following profiles: 0–20 min, 22% (A), 78% (B); 20–25
min, 22–30% (A), 78–70% (B); 25–45 min, 30–46%
(A), 70–54% (B); 45–55 min, 46–64% (A), 54–36%
(B); 55–70 min, 64–66% (A), 36–34% (B). The injection
volume was 20 μL. The flow rate was kept at 1.0 mL min–1. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 203 nm. Glucose
was determined by HPLC (LC-20AT; Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a
refractive index detector and a Cosmosil Sugar-D column (250 ×
4.6 mm2). The column was operated at 30 °C, and the
mobile phase was acetonitrile/water (75:25 v/v) at 1 mL min–1.

The ginsenoside degradation products were analyzed and identified
by a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (MAT; San Jose, CA) equipped
with an electrospray ion source in negative-ion mode. The ESI parameters
were the following: ion source voltage, 5000 V; capillary voltage,
−40.0 V; source temperature, 150 °C; capillary temperature,
280 °C; and sheath gas and auxiliary gas flow rates, 65 and 11
arbitrary units, respectively. Full scan spectra were recorded in
the m/z range of 200–2000.
The HPLC conditions for the HPLC/ESIMS analysis were the same as above
mentioned for the analysis method of ginsenosides.

Statistical
Analysis
The statistical analysis was conducted
based on an SPSS20.0 system (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data are expressed
as the mean ± SEM. The ginsenoside contents of the two groups
were analyzed by independent sample t-test. Differences
between the groups were analyzed using analysis of variance ANOVA.
A difference of p < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.
