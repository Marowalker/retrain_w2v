New brominated β-carbolines
irenecarbolines A (1) and B (4) along with
known β-carbolines 2 and 3 and a new
8-oxoisoguanine derivative, 5, were isolated from a solitary
ascidian, Cnemidocarpa irene. The structures
of these compounds
were determined on the basis of their spectral data. All, except for 3, inhibited the action of acetylcholinesterase (AchE). The
activities of 1 and 5 were comparable to
those of galantamine, a clinically used AchE inhibitor. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be present in high concentrations
in blood, and fluorescence was observed in certain types of cells
found in the blood of the tunicate.

==== Body
Introduction
Ascidians (phylum Urochordata)
are known to be a rich source of
important biologically active secondary metabolites, as represented
by ecteinascidin 743, developed as the anticancer drug trabectedin
and now used worldwide to treat soft-tissue sarcomas.1 Morphologically, ascidians can be classified into two types,
colonial and solitary. Although numerous secondary metabolites (more
than 1200 compounds) have been isolated from ascidians, they have
generally been obtained from colonial ascidians. To date, approximately
a hundred compounds have been obtained from solitary species, with
many metabolites with interesting structures and biological activities
reported only recently.2,3 In our continuing effort to discover
molecules that interact with neuronal receptors,4 ion channels, or neurotransmitters, we found that the aqueous
crude extract of the solitary ascidian Cnemidocarpa
irene collected in Hokkaido, Japan, inhibited acetylcholinesterase
(AchE). Here, we report the isolation and structural determination
of new β-carboline derivatives and a new purine derivative as
bioactive principals of the tunicate. We also report our unexpected
finding that some of those compounds are present in large amounts
in the blood (coelomic fluid) of the animal.

Results and Discussion
A specimen of a solitary ascidian, C. irene, was collected from the Sea of Japan from an underwater cave in
the Oshima-Kojima Islet off the Oshima Peninsula of Hokkaido, Japan.

Both water and methanol extracts of the tunicate exhibited inhibition
of AChE, as measured by Ellman’s method,5 inhibiting 73 and 63% of the enzyme activity at a final
concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Thus, we separated the extracts
guided by the AChE inhibition activity and obtained four β-carbolines
(1–4) and a purine derivative (5) (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Compounds isolated from C. irene.

The frozen tunicate (130 g) was
extracted with water, and the extract
was dialyzed with a cellulose membrane to remove macromolecules. The
low-molecular-weight fraction exhibited the bioactivity of a highly
complex mixture of UV-absorbing compounds and so it was fractionated
on a C18 reversed-phase flash column. The fraction was eluted with
40% aqueous methanol and further separated by a Sephadex LH-20 column
to give 1 (55.3 mg, purity 96%) as a yellowish solid.
Compound 1 showed two molecular ions at m/z 261 and 263 in its matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrum, indicating the
presence of a bromine atom. A molecular formula of C12H10N2Br was established on the basis of its high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) data along with
its 13C NMR data, in which 12 carbon signals were observed
(Table 1). The extended
conjugation nature of the compound was suggested from UV data, showing
characteristic absorptions at λ 247, 311, and 368 nm. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 1, two singlets and four doublets
were observed in the aromatic region. Analysis of the J-values as well as correlation spectroscopy (COSY) data indicated
that sets of protons that resonated at δH 8.59/8.49
(J = 5.9 Hz) and δH 8.24/7.53 (J = 8.3 Hz) were adjacent to each other. In addition to
those aromatic protons, a heteroatom-bound methyl singlet was observed
at δH 4.51. Two spin systems, for N-methyl pyridinium (C-9a/CH-1/N-CH3/CH-3/CH-4/C-4a)
and trisubstituted benzene (C-5a/CH-5/CH-6/C-7/CH-8/C-8a) substructures,
were established on the basis of NMR data, including COSY, heteronuclear
single-quantum correlation, and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation
(HMBC) data (Figure 2).

Cross HMBC correlations between H-5 and C-4a and H-4
and C-5a connected
C-4a and C-5a (Figure 2). A nitrogen atom was inserted between the aromatic C-8a (δC 146.3) and C-9a (δC 137.1) on the basis
of chemical shifts of those carbons to form a pyrrole ring (Table 1).

The remaining
hydrogen and bromine atoms were connected to the
pyrrole nitrogen and a benzene ring, respectively, to form an N-methyl-β-carbolinium structure. The bromine atom
was assigned to C-7 (δC 127.4) because the nuclear
Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) correlation between H-5
(δH 8.24) and H-4 (δH 8.49) indicated
that spin system δ 8.24/7.53 (H-5/H-6) is in the upper half
of the carboline ring (Figure 2). The counterion was assigned to be a chloride ion on the
basis of the negative-mode ESIMS data (Figure S7b in the Supporting Information (SI)). Thus, the structure
of 1 was determined to be 7-bromo-N-methyl-β-carbolinium
chloride. Although compound 1 is structurally related
to 2-methyleudistomines D (6) and J (7),
which are cytotoxic compounds that are found in Eudistoma
gilboverde (Figure 3),61 itself
has never been reported previously. It was named irenecarboline A
after the species name of the tunicate.

Figure 3 Known halogenated β-carbolinium
compounds.

Compounds 2 and 3, which emitted blue
fluorescent light on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) upon irradiation
with UV light, were also isolated from a bioactive eluent (30% aqueous
methanol) of the above C18 flash column. The characteristic UV absorption
patterns of these compounds, similar to those of 1, suggested
that they are also β-carboline alkaloids. Thus, the fraction
was further separated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, and
the fluorescent compound was finally purified by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) to give 2. A minor fluorescent
compound accompanying 2 was also purified to give 3. Compounds 2 and 3 were assigned
to be N-methyl-β-carbolinium and N-methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate, respectively, on the basis
of their spectroscopic and spectrometric data (Figures S8 and S9).

N-Methyl-β-carboline
was first found in
the bark of Desmodium pilchellum(7) and later in the Okinawan Haploscrerida sponge,8 whereas N-methyl-β-carboline-3-caroxylate
was first reported in the deep sea soft coral Lignopsis
spongiosum as a weak antimicrobial compound.9

Compound 4 was isolated from
a 2-propanol extract
of the residual material after water extraction of the animal. The
molecular formula of 4, C13H12N2Br, deduced from HRESIMS, along with NMR data (Table 1), suggested that it was a higher
homologue of 1. The overall profile of the 1H NMR data of 4 was very similar to that of 1, with a new methyl singlet at δH 3.07 replacing
the signal for H-1. The NOESY correlations observed between this methyl
(δH 3.07) and the N-methyl group
(δH 4.38), along with the above data, indicate the
position of the methyl to be at C-1. An ABX system for the trisubstituted
benzene and an AB system for H-3/H-4 were evident from the 1H NMR data. The position of the bromine substitution was again determined
to be C-7 because a NOESY correlation was observed between H-5 (δH 8.27) and H-4 (δH 8.48), as in the case
of 1. Thus, the structure of 4 was determined
to be 7-bromo-1-methyl-N-methyl-β-carbolinium
chloride. As 4 had never been reported previously, we
named it irenecarboline B.

Compound 5 was present
in the 10% aqueous methanol
eluate of the above C18 flash column. This fraction was further purified
by combinations of gel-filtration chromatography on Sephadex LH-20
and HW-40 columns to give 5 as a major component. The
HRESIMS of 5 along with the 13C NMR data suggest
a formula of C8H11N5O2. Three singlets at δH 3.56, 3.66, and 3.82 in the 1H NMR spectrum were assignable to N-methyl
groups. Compound 5 exhibited a characteristic UV absorption
at 313 nm, which differs significantly from that observed for β-carbolines.
These spectral characteristics were similar to those of the neuroactive
methylated 8-oxoisoguanines (9–11) previously reported by us from marine sponges (Figure 4).10 The positions of the three methyl groups were assigned on the basis
of the key HMBC correlations observed between CH3-3/CH3-9 (δH 3.82/3.66) and C-4 (δC 141.6), CH3-9 and C-8 (δC 154.0), CH3-1 (δH 3.56) and C-6 (δC 146.7), and CH3-1/CH3-3 and C-2 (δC 150.2) (Figure 4). The heteroatom substitution pattern in the purine ring of 5 was assigned to be of the 8-oxoisoguanine type because the
UV absorption at a λmax of 313 nm for 5 was closer to that of 9–118 than to that of the 8-oxoguanine type (∼290
nm).11 Therefore, the structure of 5 was assigned to be 1,3,9-trimethyl-8-oxoisoguanine.

related isoguanines from sponges.

Next, we tested the inhibition of AChE by compounds 1–5 at a fixed concentration of 0.1 μg/mL.
All compounds except for 3 inhibited more than 50% of
the enzyme activity (Table 2). Thus, we generated concentration–response curves
for 1, 2, 4, 5, and galantamine (GAL), a positive control (Figure 5). All tested compounds exhibited concentration-dependent
inhibitions. The IC50 values calculated from the curves
are listed in Table 2.

It is well known that β-carbolines inhibit cholinesterases7,12,13 and that β-carbolinium
salts are better inhibitors than their nonionic counterparts.7,14 The most recent example is a chlorinated nostocarboline (8) (Figure 3) isolated
from the cyanobacterial strain of Nostoc 78-12A,
which was shown to inhibit AChE at an IC50 value of 5.3
μM.15 Nevertheless, our finding added
new information to the structure–activity relationship of β-carbolinium
AChE inhibitors in that the bromine substituent on the benzene ring
and an alkyl substituent at C-1 of the pyridine ring positively contributed
to the activity, whereas the carboxyl group at C-3 reduced the activity.
Moreover, we detected inhibitory activity in purine 5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a natural
purine compound with anticholinesterase activity. Of note, however,
synthetic theophylline derivatives that were designed and synthesized
based on the structure of donepezil, a commercially used AChE inhibitor
for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, exhibit inhibitory
activity.16

To date, no chemical
investigations on C. irene have been
reported, although several interesting secondary metabolites,
including pentacyclic pyridoacrydine, the cnemidines17 and taurine amides of various heteroaromatics, and stolonines
A–C,18 were reported from Australian Cnemidocarpa stolonifera. 3-Bromotryptamine and 1,3-dimethylisoguanine
were also reported from Cnemidocarpa bicornuta from New Zealand.19 Thus, this genus
of ascidians might be of interest due to its unique biosynthetic machinery
for the production of bioactive aromatic molecules.

The presence
of potent inhibitors of neurotransmitter biosynthesis
in ascidians is intriguing in light of their physiological functions.
We thus examined the localization of β-carbolines in the animal.
A live animal was dissected, and the organs and blood were separately
collected. Irradiation with UV light (360 nm) onto the dissected animal
resulted in the emission of blue fluorescence, mainly from the blood
(see the graphic in the abstract). Liquid chromatography (LC) analysis of
the blood indicated that the concentrations in 1 and 2 were 250 and 210 μM, respectively, which are 340 and
30 times higher than their IC50 values.

We were able
to keep the ascidian healthy for more than 5 months
in a laboratory aquarium. Fortuitously, the animal spawned and larvae
were collected. Interestingly, the entire body of the larva emitted
fluorescence upon irradiation at 405 nm (Figure 6). Fluorescent micrograph observations of
the blood showed many types of morphologically distinguishable cells.
Interestingly, the same types of cells reacted differently to the
fluorescence (Figure 7). Six to nine different cell types have been identified in ascidians,
and their physiological roles have been reported to be involved in
the immune response and vanadium concentration, although the details
are largely still unknown.20−22 It is known, however, that the
tunichromes found in several species of both solitary and colonial
ascidians form fluorescent complexes with vanadium ions, and certain
blood cells emit fluorescence upon irradiation with blue light. The
presence of vanadium and tunichromes in the present species has never
been reported, and indeed we could not detect the presence of tunichromes
in the LC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the present sample.

(C, D) each represent the same view field. Numbered cells (arrow)
show morphologically different cells. Some morphologically identical
cells that differ in fluorescence (e.g., 10 and 11) are numbered separately.

In solitary ascidians, defensive
primary metabolites, such as antimicrobial
peptides23,24 and lectins,25,26 are well known
to be present in the blood. In some cases, however, small secondary
metabolites are suspected to function as chemical defenses. For example,
halocyamines, tetrapeptide-like metabolites with antimicrobial activity,
were found in the blood “morula”-like cells, the most
abundant cells in the hemocytes of the edible tunicate Halocynthia roretzi.27

The presence of β-carbolines in the blood of C. irene suggested some physiological functions of
the compounds in this species. However, a possible defensive role
of these compounds against bacterial infection is less likely, as 1 and 2 did not show antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis (data not shown). Of note, the cholinergic neuron in Ciona intestinalis larvae was characterized and shown
to govern the complex motor behavior of the larvae.28 Interestingly, the settlement process of the metamorphosing
larvae of C. intestinalis was stimulated
by treatment with acetylcholine.29 These
observations supported the idea that the AChE inhibitors in ascidian
blood have functions. Further investigations on the biosynthesis and
physiological functions of the aromatic metabolites present in this
ascidian species are in progress in our laboratory.

Experimental
Section
General
Infrared spectra were recorded on FT/IR-4200
(JASCO, Tokyo) using KBr pellets. UV–vis data were recorded
on SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using water as
a solvent. NMR data were recorded on a JNM 400, ECP 400, ECZS 400
(1H 400 MHz, 13C 100 MHz), or ECA600 (1H 600 MHz, 13C 150 MHz) (JEOL, Tokyo). The samples were
dissolved either in D2O (99.990 atom % D) or methanol-d4 (99.8 atom % D). Chemical shifts were referenced
in 1H NMR to methanol-d4 δH 3.30 and in 13C NMR to methanol-d4 δC 49.0. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were
recorded on an AB4700 spectrometer (Sciex, Tokyo) using either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinamic
acid or gentisic acid as a matrix. HRESIMS spectra were recorded on
Exactive (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Yokohama). An LC/MS experiment
was performed in the positive ESI mode on a Sciex 5600 LC/MS system
using an AM12S03 YMC reversed-phase column (C18, 4.6 × 75 mm2), eluting with a gradient of MeOH (0.05% formic acid)–H2O (0.1% formic acid). The purity of the compounds was established
using a Corona ultra RS charged aerosol detector (CAD) (Thermo-Fisher).
Normal-phase (silica gel 60F 254) or reversed-phase (RP18F 245S) plates
were used for TLC using (A) pyridine/EtOAc/AcOH/H2O 150:70:33:60
or (B) CHCl3/MeOH/AcOH/H2O 40:20:2:4 (v/v) for
normal-phase and MeOH/H2O 25:75 for reversed-phase TLC.
HPLC was performed on a system comprising an LC-20AD pump and an SPD-M20A
photodiode array detector (Shimadzu) using COSMOSIL (5C18-AR-II packed
column, 10 mm i.d. × 250 mm), eluting with a gradient of MeOH–H2O 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (v/v).

Biological
Material
Ascidians were collected using
SCUBA in September 2013 and 2015 from a 20 m deep underwater cave
in the Oshima-Kojima Islet of the Sea of Japan, off Oshima Peninsula,
Hokkaido, Japan, during the cruise of the Hokkaido University research
vessel, Ushio Maru. The specimens were stored at −20 °C
pending use. Two live specimens were kept in an aquarium for 6 months
by feeding with brine shrimp. A larva found in the aquarium was kept
separately in a Petri dish. The animal was identified by one of the
authors (T.N.) as C. irene (Hartmeyer,
1906), and reference specimens were deposited in the National Museum
of Nature and Science, Tsukuba (registered as NSMT-Pc1124 to 1128).

Isolation of 1, 2, 3,
and 5
A frozen specimen (HAK83, 130 g) was lyophilized,
and the dried sample was extracted with water to give a crude extract
after lyophilization (6 g). The crude extract was suspended in water
and dialyzed using a cellulose (15 kDa cutoff) tube to give a macromolecular
portion (0.28 g) and a low-molecular-weight portion (5.3 g). The small
molecular portion (3.81 g) was separated on a C18 (Wako gel) flash
column (5.5 × 20 cm2, 0.05% TFA aq. with increasing
amounts of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, and 100% methanol, each 300 mL).
The active fraction (40% methanol eluate) was separated on a Sephadex
LH-20 column (2.5 × 120 cm2, 0.05% TFA, 1.5 mL/min,
10.5 mL/tube × 120 fr.). The fractions were combined according
to TLC into nine fractions. Compound 1 was eluted in
fraction 7. The purity of the fraction was determined to be 95% using
a CAD detector. Irenecarboline A (1), pale yellow solid:

C12H10N2Br, 261.0022). A set of chloride
ions was detected in negative-mode ESIMS m/z 34.96/36.96 [M]−.

The 30% methanol
eluent of the C18 column was further separated on a Sephadex LH-20
column (2.5 × 120 cm2, 0.05% TFA, 1.5 mL/min, 10.5
mL/tube × 120 fr.) to give a fraction containing 2 (540–620 mL eluate) and 3 (630–840 mL

A fraction (266 mg) eluted
with 10% MeOH using the C18 flash column
was chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column into nine fractions.

Isolation of 4
A fresh specimen of the
ascidian (448 g) was extracted with water, and then, the residual
material was exhaustively extracted with 2-propanol and finally with
methanol. The organic extract was concentrated, and the residue was
partitioned between the upper and lower layers of hexane–ethyl
acetate–methanol–water (4:7:4:3). The aqueous layer
was further partitioned between butanol and water. HPLC analysis of
the butanol layer indicated the presence of compounds 1 and 2 and a small amount of 4. Purification
of the butanol layer (26 mg) by reversed-phase HPLC afforded 4 (1.96 mg). Irenecarboline B (4): UV (MeOH)
λmax (log ε) 248 (4.00), 313 (3.92),
370 (3.52); IR (KBr) 3433, 2928, 2372, 1681, 1398, 1330, 1201, 1337,
806, 667, 472; 1H NMR (methanol-d4, 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (methanol-d4, 100 MHz), see Table 1; HRESIMS m/z 275.01758
[M]+ (calcd for C12H12N2Br, 275.01784).

Inhibition of AChE
Ellman’s
method was used
to assess the inhibition of AChE.30 Briefly,
5,5′-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (3 mM, 125 μL), acetylthiocholine
(1.5 mM, 25 μL), Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM, 50 μL),
and the sample solution (10 mg/mL, 5 μL) were mixed in a 96-well
microtiter plate, and then, AChE from the electric eel Electrophorus electricus (0.28 U/mL, Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to the mixture. Absorption with the sample (A), with control water (B), and without AChE (C) at 412 nm was measured after 5 min of incubation at room
temperature. Inhibition was calculated using the following equation  Concentration–inhibition
curves (n = 3 at each data point) were generated,
and IC50 values were calculated using the software GraphPad
Prism.
