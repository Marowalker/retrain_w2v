To meet the increasing
need for clean combustion, improve the combustion
efficiency of fuels, and reduce the pollutants produced in the combustion
process, it is necessary to systematically study the combustion of
hydrocarbon fuels. An accurate and detailed chemical kinetic model
is an important prerequisite for understanding the combustion performance
of hydrocarbon fuels and studying complex chemical reaction networks.
Therefore, based on ReaxGen, new detailed mechanisms for the low-temperature
combustion of n-nonane are proposed and verified
in detail in this study. Meanwhile, some international mainstream
combustion models such as the LLNL model and the JetSurf 2.0 model
are compared with ours, showing that the proposed new mechanisms can
better predict the ignition delay combustion characteristics of n-nonane, and they also hold in a wide range of conditions.
In addition, the numerical simulation results of the concentration
curve calculated for the new mechanisms, especially Model v2, are
in good agreement with the experimental data, and the mechanisms can
reproduce the performance of the negative-temperature-coefficient
behavior toward n-nonane ignition. The numerical
simulation results of the laminar flame propagation velocity varying
with the equivalence ratio are also in good agreement with the available
experimental data. Finally, the ignition delay sensitivity of n-nonane is analyzed by the sensitivity analysis method;
the key reactions affecting the ignition mechanism are investigated;
and the reaction path analysis is conducted to better understand the
models’ predicted performance. In a word, the new mechanisms
are helpful to understand the ignition properties of large hydrocarbon
fuels for high-speed aircrafts.

1 Introduction
With
the development of the aerospace industry, especially the
acquisition of supersonic flight technology, higher technical requirements
are put forward for the development and design of advanced engines.
Aviation fuel gradually emerged with the birth of the aircraft at
the beginning of this century. In order to ensure flight safety and
long lifespan of engines, there are strict requirements on fuel quality.
Linear paraffins usually account for a large proportion of diesel
and aviation fuels.1,2 The literature shows that the
mass fraction of RP-3 aviation kerosene is as high as 72.0%.3 At present, the basic combustion data on linear
alkanes from methane to octane are abundant, and combustion-related
measurement data on n-decane, n-dodecane,
and other large hydrocarbons can be effectively obtained. Nonetheless,
research on the oxidation chemistry of n-nonane is
very scarce. Taking into account that n-nonane is
a typical representative of paraffin in petroleum-based fuels,3−5 experimental and theoretical studies on n-nonane
combustion are particularly necessary for the development of clean
and efficient combustion and the development of new energy fuels.

The detailed description of the existing experimental data on n-nonane combustion is shown in Table 1.4,6−11 Although establishing a comprehensive n-nonane
kinetic mechanism to describe its oxidation under a wide range of
experimental conditions is important because of the complexity of
large hydrocarbon fuels, the kinetic models currently used to describe n-nonane combustion are extremely rare, and are primarily
acquired by manual construction. Among them, Westbrook et al. developed
a kinetic model (LLNL model)12 for describing
the pyrolysis and oxidation of linear alkanes (from n-octane to n-hexadecane) over a wide temperature
range; Wang et al. developed a kinetic model (JetSurf 2.0 model)13 for the high-temperature oxidation of linear
alkanes; cyclohexane; and methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,
and n-butyl cyclohexanes. Because the detailed combustion
mechanism usually contains a very large number of species and reactions,
the mechanism for manual construction takes a long time and is prone
to errors. Conversely, this paper proposes a method to develop a high-precision
low-temperature mechanism for the combustion of n-nonane using an automatic mechanism construction program.

At present, there have been a few automatic mechanism generation
programs, such as EXGAS14 developed by
Battin-Leclerc et al., MAMOX15 developed
by Ranzi’s research group in Milan, REACTION16 developed by Blurock et al., RMG17 developed by Green et al., and ReaxGen18 developed by Li Xiang Yuan’s team. Among them, ReaxGen has
successfully developed some low-temperature combustion mechanisms
for large hydrocarbons, such as n-heptane,19,20n-decane,21 and n-undecane.21 Accordingly, this
paper mainly uses ReaxGen to automatically generate the new detailed
mechanisms for low-temperature combustion of n-nonane.
In order to verify the reliability and rationality of the new mechanisms,
a few internationally published models that can be used for n-nonane combustion simulation are compared with them, such
as the LLNL model12 and the JetSurf 2.0
model.13 This study aims to investigate
the ignition delay time in a shock tube, the concentration of important
species in the jet stirred reactor (JSR), and the propagation speed
of the premixed laminar flame. Furthermore, the numerical simulation
results of these combustion models are analyzed and compared with
the effective experimental data in literature. Finally, the sensitivity
analysis and the reaction path analysis are used to identify the types
of reactions that are critical for low-temperature ignition.

2 Mechanism Construction
The detailed combustion mechanism
of hydrocarbon fuels can be constructed
according to the hierarchical structure.19,22 The core mechanism is crucial to explain the combustion characteristics
of large hydrocarbons.23 Generally, the
mechanism construction for large hydrocarbons mainly includes two
parts: the core mechanism and the expansion mechanism. The core mechanism
is mainly low-carbon hydrocarbon molecules and free radicals (less
than four carbon atoms). Previous studies have shown that AramcoMech
1.324 and AramcoMech 3.025 developed by Curran’s group have a good effect on
the mechanism construction for large hydrocarbons.19 Therefore, the new mechanisms of n-nonane
developed in this study are mainly based on AramcoMech 1.3 and AramcoMech
3.0, respectively. In addition, the expansion mechanisms are automatically
generated by ReaxGen. The fundamental concept in generating a mechanism
by ReaxGen is the reaction classes. The specific reaction classes
in this work are mainly:18,21,26

the Supporting Information. Finally, the
new n-nonane combustion mechanisms, Model v1, based
on AramcoMech 1.3, including 1200 species and 4615 reactions, and
Model v2, based on AramcoMech 3.0, including 1506 species and 6068
reactions, are developed (provided in the Supporting Information). In these mechanisms, the thermodynamic data and
transport data for species in the core mechanisms are derived from
refs (24) and (25), respectively; the thermodynamic
data for other species are mainly calculated by the group contribution
method proposed by Benson;27 transport
data for other species are calculated through the diffusion coefficients
using the approach introduced in ref (28).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Mechanism Validation and Comparison
In order to improve
the accuracy and the applicability of the mechanisms,
extensive verification is needed for the experimental data on various
fuels in different temperature ranges, pressure ranges, the reaction
atmosphere, and the physical model. At present, the combustion reaction
dynamics experiments used to verify the model involve macroscopic
combustion parameters such as the ignition delay time and the flame
propagation speed and microscopic combustion parameters such as species
concentration. In this paper, the new mechanisms for n-nonane combustion are verified by the experiments of the ignition
delay time in a shock tube, species concentration in a JSR, and the
laminar flame propagation speed. At the same time, a detailed comparison
is made between the new mechanisms based on automatic program construction
and the international mainstream mechanisms based on manual construction.

3.1.1 Ignition Delay in a Shock Tube
Yong et al.9 systematically studied gas-phase
ignition delay experiments for n-nonane/air mixtures
at temperatures ranging from 684 to 1448 K; pressures ranging from
2.0 to 15.0 atm; and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The n-nonane shock tube ignition delay experiment was simulated,
with the new mechanisms and the international mainstream combustion
mechanisms,12,13 by the homogeneous closed reactor
model in the Chemkin-Pro package.29 The
assumption of adiabatic, constant volume, and homogeneous conditions
is applied for high-temperature conditions. Moreover, at longer ignition
delay times such as low-temperature ignition, the gradual pressure
increase can have considerable effects on the ignition process. To
consider this pressure increase, an average pressure rise rate of
3%/ms was considered by employing the Senkin/VITM approach.30 The comparison between the numerical simulation
results and the experimental data is shown in Figures 1–3. The results show that the new mechanisms and the LLNL model12 can well predict the ignition and combustion
characteristics at different equivalence ratios. Because the JetSurf
2.0 model13 does not contain the low-temperature
combustion reaction classes of n-nonane, it can be
seen that this model can only well predict the high-temperature ignition.
On the contrary, the new mechanisms can accurately reproduce the negative-temperature-coefficient
(NTC) behavior of n-nonane ignition under different
conditions. However, some differences are still found. For example,
in Figures 1c, 2d, and 3c, the new mechanisms
and the LLNL model can give a good simulation performance, but in
the low-temperature range (T < 750 K), there are
some discrepancies between the numerical simulation results and the
experimental data. Besides, as shown in Figure 3a, the predicted values of the LLNL model
under rich combustion conditions are slightly higher than the experimental
data, those of Model v1 are slightly lower than the experimental data,
and those of Model v2 are in best agreement with the experimental
data. However, at a pressure of 5 atm, as shown in Figure 3b, it can be found that the
LLNL model and the JetSurf 2.0 model are in good agreement with the
experimental data, while our models slightly underpredict the experimental
data. Different combustion results are obtained because of the discrepancies
in the reaction network and reaction rates in different combustion
models.19 From the results of ignition
simulation, it is seen that the new mechanisms and the LLNL model
show a higher simulation accuracy.

3.1.2 Jet-Stirred
Reactor Speciation
Dagaut et al.4 experimentally studied
the oxidation of n-nonane in the JSR over a wide
range of conditions, which provided the basic data for verifying the
rationality of the combustion mechanism of n-nonane.
In this paper, the evolution of the concentration of important components
such as n-nonane, C2H4, CH4, CH2O, CO, CO2, H2, and
H2O was studied. The simulations in this section were carried
out by using the transient perfectly stirred reactor code with an
end time of 20 s in the Chemkin-Pro package, whose method is similar
to that employed by Metcalfe et al.24 and
Sarathy et al.31 The measurements and predictions
with Model v1, Model v2, the LLNL model, and the JetSurf 2.0 model
for the molar fraction profiles of n-nonane, C2H4, CH4, CH2O, CO, CO2, H2, and H2O are shown in Figures 4–9. The simulation conditions are performed
at an initial concentration of 0.1% n-nonane; equivalent
ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0; pressures of 1 and 10 atm; and residence
times of 0.07 and 0.7 s. It can be seen from the figures that the
numerical simulation results of the new mechanisms are in overall
agreement with the available experimental data, especially at atmospheric
pressure and with a residence time of 0.07 s (shown in Figures 4, 6, and 8). Model v2 is found to be superior
to other combustion models for CO, CO2, H2,
and H2O predictions, except for the H2O molar
fraction in the NTC region, as shown in Figures 5h, 7h and 9h, for which Model v2 underpredicts the experimental
data. In addition, the NTC behavior of n-nonane was
discovered experimentally between 600 and 750 K, which is well reproduced
by the new mechanisms from the evolution of n-nonane,
CO, and H2O, as shown in Figures 5, 7, and 9. In contrast, the JetSurf 2.0 model cannot reproduce
the NTC behavior of fuel combustion well (shown in Figures 5a, 7a, and 9a) because of the lack of low-temperature
reactions in this model.

0.7 s residence time.

Formaldehyde is an important
intermediate for the oxidation of n-nonane from low
temperatures to high temperatures.10 As
presented in Figure 4c, the formaldehyde concentration increases
above 900 K and reaches the peak value at 1050 K. The predictions
of the profile of formaldehyde concentration using the new mechanisms
are in satisfactory agreement with the measurement. At the same time,
under high-pressure conditions, as shown in Figures 5c, 7c, and 9c, the prediction of formaldehyde by the new models,
especially Model v2, can also be in good agreement with the experimental
data.

Although the new mechanisms and the LLNL model can well
reproduce
the NTC behavior of fuel combustion, there are still some discrepancies
with the experimental data. For example, the new mechanisms, especially
Model v2 can well predict the speciation of all the important species,
except for C2H4 and CH4 at the pressure
of 10 atm, as shown in Figure 5b,d. One of the possible reasons is that the reaction network
is not fully described in these mechanisms. In order to develop a
comprehensive detailed mechanism suitable for a wide temperature range,
a wide pressure range, and different equivalence ratio conditions,
further research work needs to be undertaken. Furthermore, our research
group is trying to optimize it by combining high-precision quantum
chemical calculations and species concentration analysis.

3.1.3 Laminar Flame Speeds
Laminar flame
speed, as an important parameter for fuel mixture reactivity, diffusivity,
and heat release, is a key factor for verifying the accuracy of the
combustion model. Ji et al.11 experimentally
determined the premixed flame propagation speeds of C5–C12
alkanes at atmospheric pressure. This section focuses on the verification
of the flame propagation speed of n-nonane with different
combustion models. Simulations were performed with the Premixed Laminar
Flame-Speed Calculation code of Chemkin package.29Figure 10 shows the comparison between the simulation results and the experimental
data on the laminar flame propagation speeds at the unburned mixture
temperature of 403 K and pressure of 1.01 × 105 Pa.
It can be clearly seen that these models have different prediction
values for n-nonane. Among them, the LLNL model is
in good agreement with the experimental values under rich combustion
conditions. Under other conditions, it has a large error with the
experimental data, especially when the equivalent ratio is 0.9–1.3.
The detailed mechanisms developed in this paper are in overall agreement
with the available experimental data except at the equivalent ratio
from 1.0 to 1.2, at which the simulation results are slightly higher
than the experimental value. The JetSurf 2.0 model, based on the core
mechanism USC Mech II,32 is better than
the other combustion models in predicting the laminar flame speed;
it has been shown that the combustion mechanisms of large hydrocarbons,
such as n-heptane,18,20 isooctane,18n-decane,18n-undecane,18n-dodecane,18 methylcyclohexane,33 and n-propylcyclohexane,34 developed with USC Mech II as the core mechanism,
show good performance for the prediction of laminar flame propagation
speed.

of 403 K and atmospheric pressure.

3.2 Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity
analysis plays an important role in understanding the key reactions
and mechanism simplification in the fuel combustion process. Considering
that there is no low-temperature combustion reaction type in the JetSurf
2.0 model, the new mechanisms and the LLNL model were selected for
sensitivity analysis. The specific conditions of the sensitivity analysis
are the equivalent ratio of 1.0, the initial temperature of 700 K,
and the pressure of 15 atm, and the result is shown in Figure 11. There are relatively significant
differences between our mechanisms and the LLNL model in the types
of key reactions that are sensitive to ignition. Among them, the reaction
with the maximum promoting effect on the ignition of n-nonane, in the new mechanisms, is the reaction class ROOH = RO +
OH, such as s46C9H20O2 ⇒ OH
+ s170C9H19O in Model v1 and s52C9H20O2 ⇒ OH + s187C9H19O in Model v2, and in the LLNL model is the isomerization
reaction ROO = QOOH, such as c9h20o2-2 = c9ooh2-4. For the reaction with the greatest
inhibition of ignition, all these mechanisms are of the reaction class
ROO = QOOH, such as s12C9H20O2 ⇒
s49C9H20O2 in Model v1, s11C9H20O2 ⇒ s43C9H20O2 in Model v2, and c9h20o2-4 = c9ooh4-2 in the LLNL model.
It can also be seen that at temperatures below 700 K, reactions that
are sensitive to ignition are the reactions in the expansion mechanism.
In addition, the reaction class RH + ROO = R + ROOH also has a promoting
effect on ignition, such as the reactions s0C9H20 + s12C9H19O2 ⇒ s2C9H19 + s46C9H20O2, s0C9H20 + s12C9H19O2 ⇒ s4C9H19 + s46C9H20O2 and s0C9H20 + s12C9H19O2 ⇒ s3C9H19 + s46C9H20O2 in Model v1, as shown
in Figure 11a, and
the reactions s0C9H20 + s13C9H19O2 ⇒ s2C9H19 + s52C9H20O2, s0C9H20 + s13C9H19O2 ⇒ s4C9H19 + s52C9H20O2 s0C9H20 + s13C9H19O2 ⇒ s3C9H19 + s52C9H20O2, s0C9H20 + s12C9H19O2 ⇒ s2C9H19 + s45C9H20O2 and s0C9H20 + s12C9H19O2 ⇒ s4C9H19 + s45C9H20O2 in Model
v2, as shown in Figure 11c, which is consistent with the low-temperature ignition characteristics
of the n-heptane combustion mechanism.26 In the LLNL model, as shown in Figure 11b, it can be seen that both
the reaction classes RH + OH = R + H2O, such as nc9h20 + oh = c9h19-4 + h2o, and RH + H = R + OH, such as nc9h20 + h = c9h19-5 + oh show strong positive sensitivity.
In addition, in the LLNL model, it was found that the decomposition
reaction of ketones such as c9ket2-4 = oh + ch3coch2 + nc5h11cho, c9ket3-5 = oh + c2h5coch2 + nc4h9cho, c9ket4-2 = oh + ch3cho + c5h11coch2, c9ket1-3 = oh + ch2cho + nc6h11cho, c9ket4-6 = oh + nc3h7coch2 + nc3h7cho, and c9ket5-3 = oh + c2h5cho + nc4h9coch2 all have an effect on ignition. Therefore, it can be concluded that
the key reactions affecting the low-temperature ignition of the new
mechanisms and the LLNL model are quite different. This indicates
that these combustion models have different effects on the ignition
delay due to the difference in the reaction network, which is like
the previous comparative study of different n-heptane
combustion models.19

of ignition delay time with respect to the
reaction rate during the low-temperature combustion of n-nonane with Model v1, Model v2, and the LLNL model.

3.3 Reaction Path Analysis
Based on the
time-integrated element flux analysis,35 the reaction path of n-nonane under constant pressure
ignition simulation was carried out with the C element as a flow target.
The element flux results for the n-nonane/O2/N2 mixtures were obtained under the conditions of a pressure
of 15 atm, an equivalent ratio of 1.0, and a temperature of 700 K
(amounts less than 5% were ignored). The reaction path analysis of
the LLNL model is displayed in Figure 12. In Figure 13, the conversion fraction of complex decomposition
pathways for Model v1 and Model v2 prescribed for n-nonane are shown in red font and black font, respectively.

Figure 12 Time-integrated
element flux analysis result of the LLNL model
for n-nonane ignition at 700 K and 15 atm with ϕ
= 1.0. The data are conversion percentages of carbon.

Figure 13 Time-integrated elemental flux analysis result of Model v1 and
Model v2 for n-nonane ignition at 700 K and 15 atm
with ϕ = 1.0. The data are conversion percentages of carbon.
(Both the species name with the red font in Model v1 and the adjacent
species name with the black font in Model v2 represent the same species.)

As shown in Figures 12 and 13, the main
fuel consumption
paths are hydrocarbon fuels (RH) producing the alkyl radicals R• by H-abstraction. Then, the reaction R• + O2 → ROO• took place to yield
peroxy radicals ROO•, which will first isomerize
to produce hydroperoxyalkyl radicals QOOH. The QOOH radicals will
further yield some O2QOOH radicals by the reaction QOOH
+ O2 → O2QOOH. It can be found that the
main reaction path is almost the same, but the conversion fraction
of complex decomposition pathways is quite different. Take n-nonyl radicals as an example. In the LLNL model, approximately
60% of n-nonyl radicals underwent the R• + O2 chemistry, and there is only 12.57% in Model v2
and only 41.17% in the Model v1. The existence of the NTC zone is
mainly due to the enhanced reversibility of the reaction R• + O2 = ROO as the temperature increases.36 In summary, the discrepancy in the reaction flux will affect
the ignition of these mechanisms.

4 Conclusion
An accurate and detailed chemical kinetic model is an important
prerequisite for understanding the combustion performance of hydrocarbon
fuels. Although large mechanisms can be produced manually, automatic
generation provides a systematic tool that helps to simplify and systematize
mechanism production. The use of a mechanism automatic program to
develop a complex large hydrocarbon combustion mechanism can effectively
reduce the mechanism construction time and errors. Accordingly, in
this study, combined with the core mechanisms—AramcoMech1.3
and AramcoMech3.0—and the expansion mechanisms produced by
the automatic generation program ReaxGen, new mechanisms for low-temperature
combustion of n-nonane are developed. In order to
verify the rationality of the mechanisms, they are analyzed and compared
with international mainstream combustion mechanisms. Systematic comparisons
show that the low-temperature combustion mechanism of n-nonane developed by the mechanism automatic program possesses a
high simulation precision in both the shock tube experiment and the
species concentration generation experiment, and can be used in a
wide range of conditions. Finally, through the ignition sensitivity
analysis, the key reactions affecting the ignition are investigated.
It is found that the reactions which have obvious effects on fuel
ignition are quite different in different combustion models; and through
the reaction path analysis, it can be seen that the conversion fraction
of complex decomposition pathways is also distinct. Therefore, it
can be inferred that different combustion models have different effects
on combustion characteristics because of different reaction networks.
In addition, because of some discrepancies between the predicted values
and the experimental data, our research group is trying to optimize
the model by combining high-precision quantum chemical calculations
and species concentration analysis. A systematic method to automatically
generate a mechanism for the low-temperature combustion of n-nonane could also be used to generate the mechanisms of
other large hydrocarbons. Moreover, the new mechanisms of n-nonane provide a theoretical basis for revealing the nature
of fuel combustion and basic data for the development of advanced
engines.
