A series
of substituted sulfonanilide analogs were prepared and
evaluated as novel potent inhibitors of SH2 domain-containing inositol
polyphosphate 5′-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2). SHIP2 has been shown
to be a new attractive target for the treatment of insulin resistance
in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), which can lead to life-threatening
diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Amongst the synthesized compounds,
the two most promising candidates, 10 and 11, inhibited SHIP2 significantly. Additionally, these compounds induced
Akt activation in a dose-dependent manner, increased the presence
of glucose transporter 4 at the plasma membrane, and enhanced glucose
uptake in cultured myotubes in vitro at lower concentrations than
metformin, the most widely used antidiabetic drug. These results show
that the novel SHIP2 inhibitors have insulin sensitizing capacity
and provide prototypes for further drug development for T2D and DKD.

==== Body
Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is
one of the major health concerns in the world
today. Globally, more than 425 million people were suffering from
this metabolic disorder in 2017, and the predicted number of affected
individuals in the future is dramatically higher, expected to reach
629 million by 2045.1 Customarily, diabetes
is divided into type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D and T2D)
in addition to some rare forms of the disease.2 T2D, accounting for the majority of the patients, is characterized
by insulin resistance (the inability of the cells to respond to insulin)
and inadequate production of insulin.2 Severe
long-term complications of T2D include cardiovascular diseases, diabetic
kidney disease (DKD), diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy.3,4 Recently, a new classification of diabetes mellitus has been proposed,
dividing the patients into five subgroups based on six clinical variables.5 Interestingly, patients with severe insulin resistance
were observed to have the highest risk of DKD, the severe and potentially
life-threatening complication of diabetes.5 This observation raises the interest to design novel insulin sensitizers
that could be used to treat T2D and DKD.

At the cellular level,
insulin resistance in muscle, adipose, and
kidney glomerular epithelial cells may be caused by a defect in glucose
uptake as a consequence of decreased activity of the phosphatidyl
inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated insulin signaling pathway or impaired
translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)
to the plasma membrane.6−8 The insulin signaling cascade is activated when insulin
binds to its receptor on the plasma membrane, triggering a cascade
of intracellular events that result in the activation of downstream
kinase Akt and glucose uptake into cells.6 SHIP2, SH2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5′-phosphatase
2, has been identified as a 5′-lipid phosphatase that suppresses
insulin signaling by hydrolyzing the PI3K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) to PtdIns(3,4)P2 (PIP2), resulting in a reduced activation of Akt and diminished glucose
uptake.9,10 Both genetic and experimental studies link
SHIP2 to metabolic disorders. Polymorphisms in INPPL1, the gene encoding SHIP2, are associated with hypertension, the
metabolic syndrome, and T2D.11−15 In rodent models of insulin resistance and T2D, SHIP2 has been shown
to be upregulated in insulin responsive tissues, including the skeletal
muscle, adipose tissue, and kidney glomeruli,16,17 apparently contributing to insulin resistance. In addition, a transgenic
mouse model overexpressing SHIP2 under a modified β-actin promoter
impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.13 These data indicate that SHIP2 is an excellent drug target
to ameliorate insulin resistance and treat T2D and DKD.

Only
a few compounds that inhibit SHIP2 have been described. The
known inhibitors belong to the thienylamide-based,18,19 pyridinylamide-based,20 or (benzenesulfonylamino)benzamide-based21 compound classes. Furthermore, only a few studies
describe the effects of these inhibitors in animal models or cultured
cells.19−21 We recently observed that metformin, a biguanide,
binds to SHIP2 directly and inhibits its catalytic activity,22 thus supporting SHIP2 as a target to treat T2D.
Apart from metformin, none of the other thus far described SHIP2 inhibitors
are in clinical use. We have now designed a sulfonanilide-based compound
library of new SHIP2 inhibitors and tested their potency to inhibit
SHIP2 in vitro. In addition, using cultured myotubes, we tested whether
the two most potent inhibitors enhance the activation of the insulin
signaling pathway and increase glucose uptake.

Results
Chemistry
Various novel sulfonanilide SHIP2 inhibitor
candidates (1–12) were synthesized
by stirring together different sulfonyl chlorides with various anilines
or N-methylanilines under basic conditions in acetonitrile
at room temperature. The solid sulfonanilide products were obtained
in good yields (49–68%) and high purity (>98%) after recrystallization
(Scheme 1).

(1 equiv), pyridine (∼6 equiv), dry MeCN (5 mL), room temperature,
35–210 min. *Yield is calculated after recrystallization from
MeOH or EtOH. **Purity is determined using HPLC by careful
integration of the peak areas.

Inhibition
of SHIP2 Activity by Sulfonanilides
To investigate
the ability of the sulfonanilides to inhibit the activity of SHIP2,
we divided them to three groups based on three different anilines: N-methylaniline, 2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline, and 2,4-difluoro-N-methylaniline. The N-methylaniline-based
sulfonanilides 1–6 inhibited SHIP2
activity by only 3–15% (Table 1). Replacing N-methylaniline with
2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline resulted in the p-tolyl compound 7, which inhibited SHIP2 activity by 17%. On the other hand,
a slight decrease in the inhibition was seen for the trifluorophenyl
compound 8 and furyl compound 9, which inhibited
SHIP2 activity by 10 and 9%, respectively. In contrast, the 2-thienyl-substituted
analog 10 showed an increase in the SHIP2 inhibition,
with a very promising inhibition efficiency of 45%. Alternatively,
modifying the aniline in compound 8 to 2,4-difluoro-N-methylaniline gave an increase in the inhibition for the
pentafluorinated compound 11, which similarly inhibited
SHIP2 activity by 45%. The 2-thienyl compound 12 with
2,4-difluoro-N-methylaniline was almost inactive.
The IC50 values for the best two SHIP2-inhibiting sulfonanilides, 10 and 11, were 41.2and 7.07 μM, respectively
(Table 1).

Cytotoxicity of Sulfonanilides 10 and 11
To further evaluate the properties
of the sulfonanilides 10 and 11, we measured
whether they affect the
viability of L6 myotubes using the alamarBlue cell viability assay.
Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 showed no or very
little effect on cell viability up to 200 μM concentration (Figure 1). When the concentration
was increased to 300 μM, sulfonanilide 10 decreased
the viability of myotubes by only 7% whereas sulfonanilide 11 reduced cell viability by 24% at this concentration (Figure 1). This indicates that sulfonanilides 10 and 11 are not toxic to myotubes.

Figure 1 Cytotoxicity
of sulfonanilides 10 and 11. Sulfonanilide 10 was not cytotoxic up to 200 μM
concentration. Both sulfonanilides 11 and 10 affected very little the cytotoxicity at high concentrations (tested
up to 300 μM).

Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 Activate
the Insulin Signaling Pathway
As the phosphorylation of Akt
indicates the activation of the insulin signaling pathway, we next
determined the effect of sulfonanilides 10 and 11 on insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation in L6 myotubes.
For this, myotubes were pretreated for 15 min with 1, 10, 25, or 50
μM sulfonanilide 10 or 11 followed
by stimulation with 10 nM insulin for an additional 15 min. Akt was
activated with 10 and 25 μM sulfonanilide 10 and
1 and 10 μM sulfonanilide 11 (Figure 2). Neither sulfonanilide 10 nor 11 activated Akt at 50 μM concentration
in this short-term treatment. The level of total Akt did not change
under any of the conditions (Figure 2). These data indicate that sulfonanilides 10 and 11 increase insulin-induced phosphorylation of
Akt in a dose-dependent manner in a short-term treatment.

Figure 2 Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 activate Akt
in L6 myotubes. L6 myotubes serum starved for 20 h were treated with
sulfonanilide 10 or 11 (1–50 μM)
or vehicle (DMSO) for 15 min after which insulin (10 nM) was added
for an additional 15 min. Activation of the insulin signaling pathway
was determined by analyzing the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 by
quantitative Western blotting. (A, B) Quantification of protein levels

expressed as fold-change relative to the vehicle, and values are mean
± SEM. Three experiments in which n = 3 for
each condition. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 Enhance Glucose
Uptake
To determine the functional effects of sulfonanilides 10 and 11, we evaluated their ability to enhance
glucose uptake into L6 myotubes stably overexpressing HA-tagged GLUT4
glucose transporter (referred to as L6-GLUT4 myotubes).18 For this, L6-GLUT4 myotubes were treated with
50 μM sulfonanilide 10 or 11 for 20
h, whereafter the cells were treated or not with 100 nM insulin, followed
by measuring the cellular uptake of radioactively labeled 2-deoxyglucose.
For comparison, we carried out glucose uptake assays with metformin,
the previously characterized SHIP2 inhibitor,22 using the same 50 μM concentration of metformin. Under serum
starvation, both 10 and 11 alone increased
glucose uptake by 18–19%. With insulin stimulation, 10 and 11 increased glucose uptake by 30 and 23%, respectively,
compared to control cells stimulated with insulin (Figure 3). Metformin, on the other
hand, did not enhance glucose uptake at this concentration with or
without insulin stimulation (Figure 3). These data indicate that sulfonanilides 10 and 11 enhance insulin-induced glucose uptake into
L6-GLUT4 myotubes at 50 μM concentration whereas metformin does
not.

Figure 3 Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 enhance glucose
uptake in L6 myotubes. Glucose uptake in L6 myotubes overexpressing
GLUT4 transporter was measured by a radioactive 2-deoxyglucose assay
after 20 h serum starvation and inhibitor treatment (sulfonanilides 10 or 11, or metformin) and either with or without
15 min insulin stimulation. Four experiments in which n = 4 for each condition. Data are expressed as fold-change relative
to the control (no inhibitor treatment, no insulin), and values are
mean ± STD. Statistical significance denoted as: * = compared
to control without insulin; # = compared to control with insulin;
**/## p ≤ 0.01, ***/### p ≤ 0.001 (unpaired Student’s t-test).

Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 Increase
the Presence of GLUT4 at the Plasma Membrane
To further confirm
that sulfonanilides 10 and 11 affect the
insulin signaling pathway, we investigated their effect on GLUT4 translocation,
using L6-GLUT4 myotubes. The HA-tag is located in the extracellular
domain of GLUT4, which allows quantifying the presence of GLUT4 on
the plasma membrane by surface labeling with an antibody against the
HA-tag. In control myotubes without sulfonanilide treatment, insulin
stimulation increased the relative amount of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane
by 16% compared to myotubes without insulin treatment (Figure 4). Treatment of myotubes with
sulfonanilide 10 led to a 4% increase in the amount of
GLUT4 on the plasma membrane without insulin stimulation (Figure 4). The increase with
insulin stimulation was 26% compared to control cells without insulin
stimulation and 10% compared to control cells treated with insulin.
Sulfonanilide 11 increased the presence of GLUT4 on the
plasma membrane by 8% without insulin stimulation. The increase with
insulin stimulation was 15% compared to control cells without insulin
stimulation, but when compared to control cells with insulin stimulation,
there was no increase (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 increase the
presence of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane. HA-GLUT4 on the plasma membrane
(PM) was measured by On-Cell Western assay after 20 h treatment with
sulfonanilide 10 or 11 and either with or
without 15 min insulin stimulation. Four experiments in which n = 6–10 for each condition. Data are expressed as
fold-change relative to the control (no sulfonanilide treatment, no
insulin), and values are mean ± STD. Statistical significance
denoted as: * = compared to control without insulin; # = compared
to control with insulin; */# p ≤ 0.05, **/## p ≤ 0.01, ***/### p ≤ 0.001
(unpaired Student’s t-test).

Docking Studies of Sulfonanilide 11
To
investigate the binding mode of our most potent inhibitor, sulfonanilide 11, we docked 11 onto the phosphatase domain
of SHIP2 (PDB ID: 4A9C; crystal structure described by Mills et al.23) (Figure 5). In our simulations, the sulfonyl group binds tightly between the
four amino acid units Arg 611, Tyr 661, Arg 682, and Asn 684 in SHIP2.
The fluoride substituents are hydrogen bonded to Arg 682 and Glu 473.
Additionally, π-stacking is observed from the phenyl ring to
the Arg 682 unit.

the binding pocket of the SHIP2 phosphatase domain (PDB ID: 4A9C).

Discussion
We have designed and
synthesized a series of sulfonanilide derivatives
that we analyzed for their potency to act as novel SHIP2 inhibitors.
Based on our in vitro analyses, we have created two new nontoxic SHIP2
inhibitors that enhance glucose uptake into cultured myotubes more
potently than metformin.

In our molecular library of 12 sulfonanilide
derivatives, based
on three different anilines, we observed that combining a highly fluorinated
benzenesulfonyl chloride with 2,4-difluoro-N-methylaniline
as in 11 increases the ability of the sulfonanilide to
inhibit the activity of SHIP2 as measured by using the purified SHIP2
phosphatase domain and malachite green phosphate assay. Additionally,
the 2-thienyl compound 12 with 2,4-difluoro-N-methylaniline was almost inactive possibly due to blocking of the
hydrogen bonding to the free N–H group, therefore having a
negative effect on the binding mode. This result indicates that 2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline
should be preferably combined with a heteroarenesulfonyl chloride
as seen in 10, which increases the ability of the compound
to inhibit SHIP2. Consequently, sulfonanilides 10 and 11 were identified as the most potent SHIP2 inhibitors.

As SHIP2 hydrolyzes PIP3 to PIP2 and thereby
reduces the activation of Akt,9,10 SHIP2 inhibition is
expected to lead to the activation of Akt. In line with this, we observed
that sulfonanilides 10 and 11 increase the
insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, indicative of its activation,
in a similar manner as the previously characterized SHIP2 inhibitors
AS1949490, AS1938909, and N-[4-(4-chlorobenzyloxy)pyridine-2-yl]-2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-acetamide
(CPDA).18−20 Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 activated Akt in a dose-dependent manner, with the lowest concentrations
(10 and 25 μM for 10 and 1 and 10 μM for 11) enhancing Akt phosphorylation in a short-term (30 min)
treatment. The highest concentration tested (50 μM) did not
enhance Akt activation in this short-term treatment, apparently indicative
of activation of a negative feedback loop abolishing Akt activation.
In the cell viability measurements using alamarBlue, which measures
cellular metabolism and cell viability,24,25 both 10 and 11 appeared to slightly enhance the metabolic
activity of the cells at 50 μM concentration. The highest concentration
of sulfonanilide 11 (300 μM) lowered cell viability
by 24% while 10 had only a minor effect on viability
at this concentration. This indicates that both 10 and 11 are well tolerated by myotubes at their effective concentrations.

SHIP2 inhibition is expected to enhance the insulin-induced increase
in glucose uptake, and as expected, sulfonanilides 10 and 11 increased glucose uptake into myotubes after
20 h treatment at 50 μM concentration. Metformin, the most widely
used antidiabetic drug, did not increase glucose uptake at this concentration.
We and others have previously shown that 2 mM metformin is necessary
to increase glucose uptake into myotubes.22,26 It may be that sulfonanilides 10 and 11 are more potent than metformin in increasing glucose uptake, or
alternatively, 10 and 11 may be transported
more efficiently into cells than metformin. Metformin is internalized
by organic cation transporters (OCTs), the expression of which is
lowered in cultured cells in vitro compared to tissues in vivo, thus
leading to a low uptake of metformin in vitro.27 Previous studies have shown that sulfonylureas bind to
the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium
channel, also present in muscle cells.28 Apparently, sulfonanilides 10 and 11 are
internalized in a similar manner by SUR, but this requires further
studies. Nevertheless, sulfonanilides 10 and 11 enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into myotubes at a concentration
ineffective for metformin.

An earlier study revealed that the
sulfonylureas gliclazide and
glyburide increased glucose uptake independently of insulin by increasing
the content of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) at the plasma membrane
in L6 myotubes, with no effect on GLUT4.29 Sulfonanilides 10 and 11 slightly increased
the presence of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane with or without insulin
stimulation, which may be due to increased exocytosis or slower endocytosis
of GLUT4 as a result of the treatment with the sulfonanilides. This
may explain at least partially the increased glucose uptake seen with
sulfonanilides 10 and 11. On the other hand,
the sulfonylureas glimepiride, gliquidone, and glipizide have been
shown to enhance insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by increasing
the transcriptional activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ (PPARγ),30 a transcription
factor that regulates lipid and glucose metabolism.31 It thus appears that different sulfonylureas affect glucose
metabolism via different mechanisms, in addition to their major function
as enhancers of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells.27

The new suggested classification of diabetes
into different subgroups
based on specific clinical characteristics opens an important avenue
for developing new and more effective individualized treatments as
patients in different subgroups have a differing risk of diabetic
complications.5 Of special interest in
terms of DKD is the subgroup of severely insulin resistant patients.5 In our previous study, we found that SHIP2 activity
is elevated in the kidney in patients with T2D receiving other medication
than metformin compared to people without diabetes.22 We further found that metformin increases the insulin sensitivity
of peripheral tissues and protects from a kidney injury by inhibiting
the catalytic activity of SHIP2.22 Thus,
new SHIP2 inhibitors that are more potent than metformin in their
insulin sensitizing capacity could provide more effective treatment
options for T2D and DKD and serve as an alternative to metformin when
its use is contraindicated.

In conclusion, our results show
the potential of targeting SHIP2
to develop new treatments for T2D. Here, we have synthesized a molecular
library of sulfonanilide derivatives and established their capacity
to act as novel SHIP2 inhibitors. Among the compounds synthesized,
2′-bromo-4′-fluoro-2-thiophenesulfonanilide (10) and 2′,4′-difluoro-N-methyl-2,3,4-trifluorobenzenesulfonanilide
(11) were identified as the most potent SHIP2 inhibitors
having insulin sensitizing capacities. Therefore, these compounds
serve as important prototypes for the further development of new treatments
for T2D and DKD.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Commercially purchased reagents
and solvents were used without further purification if not otherwise
stated. N-Methylaniline and 2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline
were distilled prior to use. The solvents were dried in a VAC Vacuum
Atmospheres Co. solvent purifier system. The reactions were followed
using Sigma-Aldrich Supelco silica gel on TLC Al foils with fluorescent
indicator 254 nm and using the Plate Express Advion MS (TLC-CMS) instrument
with APCI±-ionization. Column chromatography was performed using
VWR Chemicals silica gel 40–60 μm with the eluent systems
specified in the experiments. Melting points were measured in one
end open capillaries with a digital melting point apparatus, Büchi
B-545. 1H and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded
on a Varian UNITY INOVA 500 spectrometer (500 MHz 1H-frequency
and 125 MHz 13C-frequency) in CDCl3 (containing
0.03% tetramethylsilane, TMS, as reference) or DMSO-d6 as a solvent at 27 °C. All the chemical shifts
are given in parts per million (ppm). IR spectra were recorded using
a Bruker ALPHA FT-IR spectrometer with a platinum-ATR disc (Bruker
Optics). High-resolution mass spectrometry, HRMS, analyses were made
using a Bruker Micro-TOF time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics) with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+). The protonated
molecular ion, [M + H+], or the corresponding sodium salt,
[M + Na + H+], was identified. All the measured HRMS m/z-values were within a 5 ppm error margin.

The purity of the final products was determined using reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography, RP-HPLC. The purity of all
compounds was above 98%, determined by integration of the peak areas
using an Agilent 1200 series LC-unit. The column used was a Waters
Symmetry RP-C18, 5 microns particle size, 4.6 mm ×
250 mm. The products were eluted with the MeCN/0.1% formic acid in
milli-Q water eluent mixture using a gradient method (55:45 0–4
min, 55:45 to 90:10 4–14 min, 90:10 to 55:45 14–19 min,
55:45 19–25 min). The flow rate was 1 mL min–1 (pressure ∼110 bar), and UV-wavelengths used were 254, 280,
and 265 nm. The column temperature was 40 °C, and the injection
volume was 10 μL. Elemental analyses were performed on a vario
MICRO cube elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau,
Germany).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 1–12
In our protocol for preparing the
sulfonanilides, the sulfonyl chloride (1 equiv) was dissolved in dry
acetonitrile (5 mL) under argon atmosphere at room temperature. The
aniline or N-methylaniline (1 equiv) in pyridine
(∼6 equiv) was added to the sulfonyl chloride solution. The
reaction was stirred at room temperature under argon and monitored
by TLC and TLC-CMS until completion (35–270 min). The reaction
mixture was acidified with aq 2 M HCl solution and extracted with
ethyl acetate (6 × 5 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed
with 30 mL of water and 30 mL of aq sat NaCl solution, dried over
MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated. The crude solid product
was purified by recrystallization from either methanol or ethanol
(abs). The pure solid product was filtered, dried, and characterized
by spectroscopic methods.

SHIP2 Activity Measurements
For the activity measurements
and other biological assays, sulfonanilides 1–12 were dissolved in DMSO and then further diluted into indicated
concentrations in assay buffers or media. The capacities of 1–12 to inhibit SHIP2 activity and the
IC50 values of 1–12 were
measured using the recombinant SHIP2 phosphatase domain and malachite
green phosphate assay at the High Throughput Biomedicine Unit (University
of Helsinki, Finland). Different concentrations of 1–12 were dispensed to 384-well plates after which 100 ng of
purified His-tagged recombinant SHIP2 phosphatase domain in reaction
buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.25, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, 250
mM sucrose and 0.25 mM EDTA) was added, and the plates were incubated
for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was started by adding
7.5 μL of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City,
UT, USA) diluted in the reaction buffer (the final concentration of
PI(3,4,5)P3 per well was 100 μM in the total volume of 15 μL),
plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and 15 μL
of BIOMOL green reagent (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) was added
to wells. After 25 min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance
was measured at 620 nm using a Pherastar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech,
Offenburg, Germany) (n = 3 for each condition).

Cell Culture
Rat L6 myoblasts (American Type Culture
Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA) and L6 myoblasts stably overexpressing
HA-tagged GLUT4 transporter (L6-GLUT4) were grown in high glucose
DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA), glutamine (Lonza; Walkersville, MD, USA), and penicillin–streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) at +37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
For differentiation, the FBS concentration in the medium was lowered
to 2%.

Cytotoxicity Assay
For cytotoxicity analyses, L6 myoblasts
were seeded on 96-well plates, differentiated for 7 days into myotubes,
and incubated O/N with 0-300 μM sulfonanilides after which 10
μL of alamarBlue cell viability reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) was added according to the manufacturer instructions.
The fluorescence was measured at 544/590 nm ± 20 nm using a Hidex
Sense microplate reader (Hidex, Turku, Finland) at 0 and 60 min time
points after the addition of the alamarBlue reagent, and the viability
of the cells was calculated. The assay was repeated three times (n = 4 for each condition).

Akt Activation Assay
To measure the Akt activation
(phosphorylation), L6 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes
for 7 days, serum starved O/N, and treated with 0–50 μM
sulfonanilides for 15 min after which 10 nM insulin (Actrapid, Novo
Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was added for an additional 15 min. The
cells were lysed in NP-40 buffer (1% nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (50
mM NaF and 1 mM Na3VO4) and protease inhibitor
cocktail (cOmpleteProtease Inhibitor Coctail tablets, Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and then immunoblotted as in Tolvanen et
al.32 Briefly, samples were separated in
8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL
PVDF transfer membrane, Merck Millipore Ltd., Tullagreen, Ireland).
The membrane was blocked using Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln,
NE, USA) and incubated with primary antibodies against pAkt (phospho-Akt,
Ser473, #9271, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), Akt (pan-Akt,
#281046, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and actin (A3853,
Sigma-Aldrich) followed by secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW Donkey
anti-Rabbit and IRDye 680RD Donkey anti-Mouse, both from LI-COR, Lincoln,
NE, USA). Three individual assays were performed (n = 3 for each condition).

Glucose Uptake Assay
Glucose uptake
was measured by
a radioactive 2-deoxyglucose assay. L6 myotubes overexpressing GLUT4
glucose transporter were differentiated for 8–9 days. Cells
were serum-starved for 20 h supplemented with 50 μM of sulfonanilides 10 or 11, 50 μM of metformin. Thereafter,
cells were stimulated or not with 100 nM insulin for 15 min at 37
°C in DMEM (without d-glucose, l-glutamine,
phenol red, and sodium pyruvate) (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The cells were exposed to 1 μCi/mL 2-deoxy-d-[1, 2-3H(N)]-glucose (PerkinElmer,
Waltham MA, USA) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton
X-100 in PBS, and the radioactivity of lysates was measured with a
Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux liquid scintillator and a luminescense
counter (PerkinElmer). Four independent experiments were performed,
with 4 technical replicates for each condition.

On-Cell Western
for HA-GLUT4
Differentiated L6-GLUT4
myotubes cultured on 96-well plate were treated with sulfonanilides 10 or 11 at 50 μM concentration for 20
h, of which the last 4 h in a serum-free medium. The quiescent cells
were stimulated or not with 100 nM insulin for 15 min at 37 °C
and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde on ice for 5 min followed by 20
min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with a primary antibody
against HA.11 epitope tag (#901513, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA)
diluted 1/100 in 50% Odyssey Blocking buffer (LI-COR) in PBS at room
temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody
(IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse, LI-COR) and the nuclear marker DRAQ-5
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) at room temperature
for 1 h. The fluorescent signals were detected and quantified with
an Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR). DRAQ-5 was used for normalization.
Four independent experiments were performed, resulting in total in
30–34 replicates for each condition.

Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as means ±
STD or SEM of three or four independent experiments. Statistical analyses
were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test. P-values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.
IC50-values were calculated using GraphPad Software, Inc.,
Prism version 6.05 (San Diego, CA, USA) using four-parameter curve-fit.

Molecular Docking of Sulfonanilide 11 onto the
Structural Model of SHIP2
The crystal structure of the phosphatase
domain of human SHIP2 in complex with a ligand biphenyl 2,3′,4,5′,6-pentakisphosphate
was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4A9C). The protein structure
was cleaned, hydrogens added, and solvent molecules removed using
Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, BIOVIA Discovery Studio, client 2018,
San Diego: Dassault Systèmes, 2018, software. Sulfonanilide 11 was prepared using a prepared ligand function. The binding
site in SHIP2 was designed as described in Mills et al.23 Docking of 11 onto the model of
SHIP2 was performed using GOLD 5.7.1 with default parameters, and
the docking poses were analyzed visually and based on the Goldscore
Fitness values.
