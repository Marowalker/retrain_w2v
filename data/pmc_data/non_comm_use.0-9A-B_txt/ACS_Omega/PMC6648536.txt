The
ability to control the growth of carbon nanotube (CNT) coatings
with adjusted packing density is essential for the design of functional
devices with an emphasized interaction with the surrounding medium.
This challenge is addressed in the present study using an innovative
single-pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process based on the thermal
conversion of ethanol to CNTs. Benefitting from the relatively safe
and easily bio-derived carbon source is enabled using a cobalt catalyst
and a magnesium oxide promoter. The resulting innovative direct-liquid
injection CVD opens up new opportunities for low-temperature CNT deposition.
The simultaneous formation of a cobalt catalyst along the process
results in a sustainable CNT growth that is substantially emphasized
with the deposition time. Furthermore, the formation of these catalyst
nanoparticles in the porous structure nucleates new CNTs and results
in a substantial film densification. Relative to densely packed CNTs
that feature a density exceeding 1000 mg/cm3, the investigated
process enables an adjusted density from 0.1 to 20 mg/cm3 with no significant impact on the quality of the obtained multiwalled
CNTs. This unprecedented control over the packing density of the CNT
film paves the way toward the development of high-performance functional
nanocomposite coatings.

1 Introduction
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
have attracted great attention in various
applications such as chemical1 and biological2 sensing, thermal management,3 and polymer nanocomposites4,5 and as black
coatings for space applications6,7 owing to their high
aspect ratio, chemical stability, and electronic and optical properties.8

The synthesis of CNTs was reported using
different methods such
as arc discharge,9 laser ablation,10 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).11 Thermal CVD has typically retained a considerable
attention as an inexpensive mass production method.11 Not surprising that a massive effort is spent to understand
the underlying growth mechanisms on various surfaces and using a variety
of catalysts and promoters.12 Although
most of the reported low-temperature CVD growth processes for CNTs
demonstrate the plasma activation as an efficient approach, the thermal
CVD remains the method of choice.13

The low-temperature CVD synthesis usually involves the highly reactive
carbon source: acetylene.12,14 Although less reactive,
alcohols are considered as a promising alternative as high-quality
CNTs can be obtained.15 This advantage
results from the simultaneous hydroxyl radical etching of the formed
amorphous carbon,15 which extends the lifetime
of the catalyst and yields CNTs with a better quality. The hydroxyl
radicals are either issued from the thermolysis of the alcohol or
from the implementation of water vapor as an additive.16 The surface state in the thin-film technology
plays a pivotal role in determining the properties of the synthesized
coatings. This is particularly true for the growth of CNTs as their
formation is a result of a subtle interplay between the catalyst nature
and size, surface functional groups, and the carbon source.

An enhancement of the CNT growth was reported with the basicity
of the growth surface, which was associated with the preferential
conversion of hydrocarbons to fragments susceptible to undergo aromatization.17 Acid surfaces, however, were shown to favor
the formation of nonsuitable complex unsaturated hydrocarbons.17 This effect was exploited in our previous study,
and a single step CNT growth was obtained starting at 330 °C.6

Controlling the density of the grown CNTs
is an important asset
to adapt their suitability for different applications. High-density
CNTs are, for instance, suitable for supercapacitors18 and heat dissipation devices.3,19 Whereas sparsely
grown CNTs are suitable for functionalization, heterogeneous catalysis,
and reinforced composite materials.20 In
the last applications, CNTs are mostly detached from the substrate
and suspended in liquids before their processing to achieve the desired
density.21,22 Other reported approaches are based on the
adjustment of the density of the catalyst nanoparticles on the substrate
prior the CNT growth.23,24

In the present work, we
report on a mechanistic study for an innovative
low-temperature growth process where the basic promoter and the catalyst
nanoparticles are simultaneously deposited along the conversion of
ethanol into CNTs. A focus is given to the possibility to adjust the
density of the obtained CNT layer. Understanding the interplay between
the processing parameters and the growth characteristics is of prior
importance for any upscaling or further developments.

2 Results and Discussion
In this study, we do focus on the
systematic investigation of the
CNT film density as a function of the deposition parameters, an aspect
that is usually marginalized despite its importance. This shortcoming
is presumably related to the quick deactivation of the catalytic nanoparticle.25−27 A deactivation of Co and Fe nanoparticle catalysts was reported
after a duration that might be as short as 1 min during the growth
of CNTs.28 The presence of the catalyst
in the form of metal carbide is essential to maintain the diffusion
of carbon and precipitation of CNTs.29,30 The growth
ceases upon the formation of an amorphous capping carbon layer on
the metal carbide.31 To secure a continuous
growth of CNTs, the deactivated catalytic nanoparticles need to be
substituted without interrupting the process.32

The deposition of CNTs was carried out using the ethanol mixed
solution of Co(acac)2 and Mg(acac)2. Depending
on the deposition temperature, ethanol acts as a reducing agent for
Co(acac)2 to produce the catalytic nanoparticle which is
in the form of metallic or carbide of cobalt,33−35 whereas Mg(acac)2 yields MgO under the same conditions. Therefore, the process
with ethanol mixed solution of Co(acac)2 and Mg(acac)2 is expected to form Co–MgO or CoCx–MgO depending on the growth temperature.6 Here, the CNT growth catalyst is identified as
being Co or CoCx, whereas MgO is identified
as the basic growth promoter. The obtained CNT films were characterized
using Raman scattering and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
methods, and the results are displayed in Figure 1. The depth profile analysis with the SIMS
technique shows a regular intensity of carbon across the film. This
signal decays abruptly at the interface, where the intensity of elements
from the substrate is detected (Si).

Figure 1 SIMS depth profile (left panel) and Raman
surface analysis (right
panel) of the as-grown CNT films using a precursor ethanol solution
of Mg(acac)2 and Co(acac)2. The films are obtained
at 485 °C and under a pressure of 7 mbar.

The signals attributed to magnesium and cobalt are present
all
across the film but the intensities in both cases show spikes at the
interface. These spikes might be associated with the backward displacement
of the Co and MgO nanoparticles during the Cs+ bombardment.
Such a displacement is certainly favored by the low density of the
CNT film. The overall profile, however, indicates clearly that carbon,
Co, and Mg are present all across the deposited films.

The quantitative
determination of the catalyst “Co”
and promoter “Mg” content was assessed by the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy analysis. This analysis reveals representative
atomic ratios of  

The thermogravimetric analysis, not
shown, was performed in air
at a ramp of 10 K/min using the as-grown film. The profile reveals
a single weight loss step starting at ∼290 °C and ending
with a plateau at 380 °C. The low-temperature oxidation of the
CNT is attributed to the catalytic action of Co3O4 formed during the heating step or upon exposure to air. The oxidized
cobalt catalyst in addition to MgO results in 9% of the initial mass.

The Raman scattering evidences the two characteristic signals corresponding
to the in-plane, G: 1615/cm, and defect-related (D: 1360/cm) vibrations
in the CNTs. No features related to radial breading modes are detected,
which is an indication of the multiwall structure of the obtained
CNTs.36

The continuous supply of
the precursor solution (ethanol–Co(acac)2–Mg(acac)2) was investigated at the deposition
temperature of 485 °C and the pressure of 7 mbar, while increasing
the deposition time from 5 to 180 min. The geometric thickness of
the obtained CNT film, displayed in Figure 2, features a trend that diverges significantly
from the conventional linear increase of the thickness with the deposition
time in CVD processes. In fact, the growth of the CNT is reasonably
expected to take place at a constant rate on every single-catalyst
nanoparticle: vCNT = Ncatalyst·k1·t, whereas the number of the catalyst nanoparticles increases
linearly with time as well; Ncatalyst = k2·t. This situation corresponds
to two consecutive reactions with constant rates. On the basis of
this assumption, the deposition of the CNT film on the surface is
expected to evolve as a function of the square of the time, which
is confirmed by the linear trend observed in Figure 2. The linear fit features a coefficient of
determination of: nR2 = 0.993. The surface
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the grown films
after 5, 10, and 15 min shows similar morphology consisting of randomly
oriented CNT. This observation confirms the absence of an incubation
time, which is in line with the observed kinetics. A high-magnification
SEM surface morphology, displayed in Figure 3, shows CNTs diameter around 10 nm. The cross-sectional
SEM observation evidences the random nature of the grown CNTs on silicon
substrates, while maintaining a uniform overall thickness.

the CNTs as a function of deposition time (upper panels)
and surface SE-micrographs after 5, 10, and 15 min.

Figure 3 SEM cross-sectional micrographs of CNTs after different
deposition
times and a high-magnification representative surface morphology.

The effect of the temperature
from 390 to 630 °C, Figure 4, reveals a window,
450–580 °C, where the grown thickness after 2 h of deposition
is maximal. It is worth mentioning that the geometric thickness of
the film does not correspond to the length of the individual CNT as
they present a random orientation. Therefore, although the temperature
effect results in a trend that appears as the conventional three deposition
regimes: kinetic, diffusion limited, and thermodynamic; care should
be taken for the interpretation of this experimental result.

Figure 4 Effect of the
deposition temperature, pressure, and injection time
(from left to right) on the deposited thickness of CNT after 2 h of
deposition.

It is worth reminding
that no CNTs grew in the absence of MgO below
500 °C. Therefore, the growth of CNTs can be impacted by any
parameter that disturb the synergetic co-formation or distribution
of the catalyst and the promoter.

The effect of the total pressure
on the growth rate was investigated
by restricting the pumping capacity, while maintaining a constant
inlet flow rate and composition. At a substrate temperature of 485
°C, the pressure was adjusted up to 10 mbar. As displayed in Figure 4, the attained thickness
after 2 h of deposition rises linearly with the pressure. While increasing
the total pressure, the partial pressures of ethanol, Mg(acac)2, and Co(acac)2 all increase linearly. The obtained
trend evidences that the limiting step is a first order in respect
to the partial pressure of one of the reactants. This conclusion is
further confirmed by the observed linear increase of the grown thickness
with the increase of the flow rate (injection time) at a constant
pressure.

The mechanistic study reveals an appealing CNT growth
temperature
window with relatively high and stable growth rate. The deposition
rate within this window can be further adjusted by controlling the
total pressure in the reactor and the feeding rate of the reactants.

The various investigated parameters have, as seen in Figures 2 and 4, a clear impact of the growth rate assessed by measuring the geometrical
thickness of the CNT film. The monitored data, however, do not inform
about the packing density of CNTs within the obtained films. Combining
the weight gain and the geometrical thickness enabled assessing the
film density as a function of all investigated parameters. The assessed
data highlight various trends with the processing parameters. One
illustrative example, effect of the deposition time, is provided in Figure 5. This example shows
a substantial increase of the film density with the increase of the
deposition time, an increase that could be fitted with a power law.
The analysis of the various trends, however, reveals that the key
parameter influencing the density of the film is their thickness. Figure 5 displays the log–log
plot of the density of the obtained films as a function of their thickness
regardless of the investigated processing parameter. A single trend
could be identified with a power law with the exponent: 1.9 ±
0.2. It is worth noticing that the individual CNTs nucleate on the
catalytic nanoparticle that are continuously deposited along the process
on the substrate and also as a decoration of the formed CNTs. Therefore,
the growth of CNTs contributes to the rise of the geometrical thickness
and also to the densification of the film via infiltration.

Figure 5 Density (ρ)
of CNT films as a function of their thickness
(d) for different deposition durations (t), pressures, temperatures, and injection opening times. The error
bars correspond to the calculated uncertainty based on the precision
at determining the mass and thickness of the film.

The overall study shows that the density of the
CNT films is very
low relative to the densely packed vertically aligned CNTs. The last
lies typically around 30 mg/cm3 using various chemistries,
a density that was raised to 570 mg/cm3 using liquid-mediated
zipping.37 Efforts were reported on the
densification of the as-grown CNTs via the catalyst layer engineering
using a CVD process based on the catalytic decomposition of C2H2.38−41

A density of 300 mg/cm3 was reported for the grown
CNT
at 600 °C using a TiSiN buffer layer to limit the bulk diffusion
of the catalyst and an upper discontinuous aluminum layer to limit
its lateral diffusion.38 With a growth
at 700 °C, a CNT density of 250–350 mg/cm3 was
obtained using a sputtered catalyst stack: Al/Fe/Al.39 At a higher deposition temperature, 750 °C, and using
a consecutive catalyst deposition approach, a film density of ∼1000
mg/cm3 was attained.40 Probably,
the highest reported CNT film density is 1600 mg/cm3, which
was reached at 450 °C using a stack of SiO2, Cu, Ti,
Mo, and Co layers as a catalyst coating prior thermal treatment.41

It is worth noting that the present study
enables attaining a substantially
contrasting density range. The possibility to adjust this parameter
is in line with the controlled infiltration and densification upon
the rise of the thickness. A 2 orders of magnitude change of the density
is observed with the variation of the thickness, which is a considerable
asset for the adaptation of the film properties to various applications.

This flexible approach contrasts greatly with those based primarily
on the control of the density of the initial catalyst nanoparticles
prior the CNT formation.24,40,42 The last is limited by the commonly observed deactivation of the
catalyst.30 The density tuning as observed
in Figure 5 is, however,
limited by the coupled thickness-density dependency, and it is challenging
to perceive thick films with a very low density. This drawback can
be overcome for applications where a matrix or core/shell structure
is needed. In this case, the sequential deposition of the CNTs and
of the matrix7,43 enables decoupling the thickness-density
dependency.

Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate the effect
of the processing
parameters on the quality of the as-deposited CNTs. High values of
the ratio of the signals, Id/Ig, inform about the high crystallinity in the obtained
CNTs. The integrated peaks from Raman spectra, Figure 6, are displayed for all deposited CNTs while
varying the temperature, pressure, deposition time, and the precursor
injection time. The deposition parameters are represented between
the 0 and 1 to delimit the explored range. For this purpose, the injection
opening times (4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 ms) were divided by 10 ms and the
deposition pressures (3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10 mbar) were divided by
10 mbar. Similarly deposition temperatures (390, 420, 450, 485, 530,
and 580 °C) were divided by 580 °C and deposition durations
(30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) by 180 min.

Figure 6 Effect of the processing
parameters on the ratio of Raman peak
intensities.

As shown in Figure 6, the ratio Id/Ig features values
between 1.2 and 1.8 irrespective of the deposition
parameters. This observation confirms that the quality of the outer
layers of the CNTs is not sensitive to the deposition parameters within
the investigated ranges. The reported transmission electron microscopy
observations show indeed that the MgO-promoted CNT growth yields CNTs
with the defect-rich outer surface.6

3 Conclusions
A mechanistic study was performed for the
growth of randomly oriented
CNTs from the thermal conversion of ethanol on the cobalt catalyst
and using MgO as a promoter. The process enables a wide temperature
window where the growth rate is significantly high. The grown thickness
is shown to follow a power law kinetics, which was associated with
the rise of the number of catalyst particles with the deposition time.
The formation of these nanoparticles within the bulk of the porous
film enables a densification that correlates essentially with the
film thickness. The control of the film density within 2 orders of
magnitude is unprecedented for the CVD growth of CNTs. This densification
is insensitive to the processing parameters and does not influence
the quality of the obtained CNTs.

4 Experimental
Section
Films of CNTs were grown on 4″ silicon wafers
by direct
liquid injection CVD in a custom-built cold wall, vertical stagnation
point flow reactor. Ethanol solution containing 0.6 × 10–3 mol L–1 cobalt acetylacetonate
(Co(acac)2) and 0.6 × 10–3 mol L–1 magnesium acetylacetonate (Mg(acac)2)
was used as the precursor. The injection of the single mixed precursors’
feedstock was performed as a pulsed spray using a frequency of 4 Hz
and opening times adjusted between 4 and 10 ms. The injection was
performed in an evaporation tube maintained at 220 °C. The substrates
were maintained at a constant temperature between 380 and 630 °C
during deposition. Nitrogen was used as the buffer gas at a flow rate
of 550 sccm, whereas the chamber pressure was adjusted in the range
of 3–10 mbar. The standard time of deposition was set at 2
h except when investigating the growth kinetics at 485 °C, where
the deposition time was varied from 5 to 180 min.

The thickness
of the obtained films was measured using an Alpha
Step D-500 profilometer from KLA-Tencor. Cross-sectional microscopic
investigations of as-grown CNTs were carried out on a Hitachi SU-70
FE-SEM, whereas the surface morphology was inspected by SEM (FEI Helios
NanoLab 650) at a working distance of 4 mm and an accelerating voltage
of 5 kV. Raman spectroscopy was performed using an inVia Raman spectrometer
from Renishaw with a 532 nm laser at a power of 0.44 mW to avoid noncontrolled
surface heating. The SIMS was performed, on an area of 60 μm
in diameter, using SC-Ultra with a primary Cs+ beam at
an incidence of 63.2°. The current and energy of the beam were
fixed at 25 nA and 5.5 keV, respectively, during the depth profile
analysis. The detected positive ions are MCsx+ with x = 1 or 2.

The density of the grown film was assessed from
the combined geometric
thickness obtained by cross-sectional microscopy (tCNTs) and the specific mass gain due to deposition.  where m1 and m2 are the masses of
the substrate before and
after coating, respectively, whereas A is the coated
surface and d is the thickness of coated film.
