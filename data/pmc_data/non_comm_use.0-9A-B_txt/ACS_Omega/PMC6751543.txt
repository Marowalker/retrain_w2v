The electronic properties of neutral
2,4-bis(4-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
amino-2-hydroxy-6-(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)phenyl)squaraine
(1) and charged 2-((3-octadecylbenzothiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl)-3-oxo-4-((3-(4-(pyridinium-1-yl)butyl)benzo-thiazol-3-ium-2-yl)methylene)cyclobut-1-enolate
iodide (2) squaraine derivatives were analyzed based
on comprehensive linear photophysical, photochemical, nonlinear optical
studies (including two-photon absorption (2PA) and femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy measurements), and quantum chemical calculations.
The steady-state absorption, fluorescence, and excitation anisotropy
spectra of these new squaraines revealed the values and mutual orientations
of the main transition dipoles of 1 and 2 in solvents of different polarity, while their role in specific
nonlinear optical properties was shown. The degenerate 2PA spectra
of 1 and 2 exhibited similar shapes, with
maximum cross sections of ∼300–400 GM, which were determined
by the open aperture Z-scan method over a broad spectral
range. The nature of the time-resolved excited-state absorption spectra
of 1 and 2 was analyzed using a femtosecond
transient absorption pump–probe technique and the characteristic
relaxation times of 4–5 ps were revealed. Quantum chemical
analyses of the electronic properties of 1 and 2 were performed using the ZINDO/S//DFT theory level, affording
good agreement with experimental data. To demonstrate the potential
of squaraines 1 and 2 as fluorescent probes
for bioimaging, laser scanning fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa
cells incubated with new squaraines were obtained.

1 Introduction
The synthesis and investigations of new squaraine derivatives are
of great interest for a diverse range of fields, including organic
photovoltaics,1−4 ion sensing,5−8 nonlinear optics,9−12 optical data storage,13−15 photodynamic therapy,16−19 and fluorescence bioimaging.20−23 Most of the known symmetrical squaraines are neutral
compounds with electron-deficient C4O2 central
squarainyl ring playing the role of the electron acceptor part (A),
flanked by the electron-donating terminal groups (D). Together they
form corresponding D–A–D-type electronic structures,24,25 and can be stabilized by resonance with zwitterionic forms.19,26 Squaraine derivatives exhibit linear photophysical and nonlinear
optical properties that are largely determined by the nature of the
terminal substituents,27,28 intramolecular steric hindrance
and hydrogen bonding,29,30 and symmetry of the electronic
distribution.31,32

Typically squaraines possess
high photochemical stability.33,34 Symmetrical squaraines
are characterized by relatively sharp and
strong absorption bands with maximum extinction coefficient, εmax > 105 M–1 cm–1,34−36 efficient fluorescence in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range,33,37,38 and large two-photon absorption
(2PA) cross-sections, δ2PAmax up to 104 GM.12,20,39 The large 2PA cross-sections are a result
of the large εmax combined with double resonance.40 These properties are promising for applications
in two-photon-induced fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) bioimaging,39,41,42 and it is a subject of active
interest. Unsymmetrical squaraines typically exhibit much broader
and less intense absorption bands43,44 and can be
used for the development of organic solar cell technologies.1,32,45,46 Charged squaraine molecules are scarcely addressed in the scientific
literature,43,47 and are mainly characterized
by specifically designed substituents with an uncompensated charge
that does not noticeably change the electronic distribution of the
primary π-electron system. These charged substituents may have
a variety of desired effects, such as increased bonding sensitivity
for specific biomolecules,48,49 strongly modified aggregation
phenomena,50 and increased sensor’s
sensitivity.43

In this work, we present
the synthesis and comprehensive linear
photophysical and nonlinear optical characterization of neutral (1) and charged (2) squaraine derivatives with
potential for bioimaging applications. The nature of the electronic
structures, 2PA efficiency, and fast relaxations in the excited state
of 1 and 2 were revealed using a 1 kHz femtosecond
laser system along with the quantum-chemical analysis at the ZINDO/S//DFT51 levels of theory. Fluorescence bioimaging of
HeLa cells was accomplished under one-photon excitation for 1, and one- as well as two-photon excitations for 2 to demonstrate their potential ability as probes in laser scanning
fluorescence microscopy.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Design and Synthesis of 1 and 2
Squaraines 1 and 2 (Figure 1) were obtained via
the condensation of electron-rich aromatic precursors with squaric
acid in a one-pot reaction using a Dean–Stark water separator.52−55 The chemical structure and purity of the related compounds were
confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectroscopy. An overview of the synthetic procedures and molecular
characterization details are illustrated in the Supporting Information. Briefly, based on nucleophilic substitution
with 1-(2-bromoethoxy)-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane under basic conditions,
5-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino) benzene-1,3-diol was converted into compound A (see Scheme S1). For the unsymmetrical
squaraine 2, two different activated heterocyclic compounds, B and C (see Scheme S2), were synthesized based on the general reactivity of 2-methylbenzothiazole
with alkyl iodide derivatives under heating in a microwave reactor.
The two different activated heterocyclic compounds were then subjected
to a condensation reaction in a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a 10% yield
of 2 after purification. Significantly, when the last
step is performed in this way, the separation of the semisquaraine
can be avoided.

2.2 Linear
Photophysical and Photochemical Measurements
Linear spectroscopic
characterization of 1 and 2 was performed
at room temperature in air-saturated spectroscopic
grade tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and acetonitrile (ACN). All solvents were purchased from commercial
sources and used without further purification. The steady-state one-photon
absorption (1PA) spectra of 1 and 2 were
measured in 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes using a Varian Cary-500
spectrophotometer and solute concentrations C ≈
(6–8) × 10–6 M. The steady-state and
time-resolved fluorescence parameters, such as corrected fluorescence,
excitation, and excitation anisotropy spectra, fluorescence quantum
yields, Φfl, and corresponding lifetimes, τfl, of 1 and 2 were obtained for
dilute solutions (C < 10–6 M)
using a FLS980 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburg Instruments Ltd.) in standard
1 cm path length spectrofluorimetric quartz cuvettes. The values of
Φfl was determined by a relative method56 with cresyl violet in CH3OH as a
reference.57 The steady-state excitation
anisotropy spectra of 1 and 2, r(λ) = r0(λ)/(1 + τfl/θ) (where r0(λ),
θ = η·V/kT, η, V, k, and T are the fundamental
anisotropy spectrum, rotational correlation time, solvent viscosity,
effective rotational volume of the molecule, Boltzmann’s constant,
and absolute temperature, respectively),56 were measured in viscous polytetrahydrofuran (pTHF) and glycerol
at room temperature. Under these experimental conditions θ ≫
τfl (i.e., depolarization processes related to molecular
rotational motion are negligible) and the fundamental anisotropy spectrum
can be obtained as r0(λ) ≈ r(λ). The level of photochemical stability of 1 and 2 were characterized by the photodecomposition
quantum yield, Φph, equal to the number of decomposed
molecules divided by the number of absorbed photons, that can be determined
by the expression:58 1  where D(λ,0), D(λ,tir), NA, ε(λ),
λ and tir are the values of initial
and final absorbance of the solution,
Avogadro’s number, extinction coefficient (M–1 cm–1), excitation wavelength (nm), and irradiation
time (s), respectively; I0(λ) is
the spectral distribution of the excitation irradiance. Equation 1 corresponds to an absorption
method, comprehensively described in ref (58), and the values of Φph were
determined under continuous wave diode laser irradiation of 1 and 2 into the main absorption band (λ
= 650 nm, average beam irradiance ≈ 50 mW/cm2).

2.3 2PA Spectra and Femtosecond Transient Absorption
Pump–Probe Measurements
The degenerate 2PA spectra
of 1 and 2 were obtained in THF (1) and ACN (2) at room temperature in 1 mm path length
quartz cuvettes with molecular concentrations C ≈
10–3 M, using an open aperture Z-scan method.59 Transient absorption pump–probe
measurements34,60 were performed in DCM (1) and ACN (2) at room temperature in a 1 mm
quartz flow cell to minimize thermo-optical distortion and photodecomposition
processes. Experimental details of the femtosecond laser system and
process employed were comprehensively described previously.60,61 In brief, the exit laser beam of a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier
Legend Duo+ (Coherent, Inc.) at λ = 800 nm, with 1 kHz repetition
rate, pulse duration, τP ≈ 40 fs, and pulse
energy, EP ≈ 12 mJ, was split in
two separate channels for Z-scan and pump–probe
experimental setups. The first beam pumped an optical parametric amplifier
HE-TOPAS (Light Conversion, Inc., tuning range 1500–2800 nm),
and the output beam was frequency-doubled with a 1 mm BBO crystal
and filtered by spike filters with transmission bands of ≈10
nm (fwhm). The resulting laser channel was tuned in the range ∼750–1400
nm with τP ≈ 100 fs, pulse energy, EP ≤ 10 μJ, and used for Z-scan measurements. The second part of the split output
of the Legend Duo+ at 800 nm was attenuated and focused in a standard
quartz cell with water (1 cm path length), producing a white light
continuum as a probe beam for pump–probe measurements. The
pump beam for this setup was taken from the Z-scan
channel tuned to 650 nm. The transmitted probe signal was detected
with an Acton SpectraPro 2560i spectrograph and PI-MAX2 ICCD camera
(all Princeton Instruments, Inc.). The time resolution of the pump–probe
setup was estimated to be ∼200 fs.

2.4 Computational
Details
All quantum-chemical
calculations were performed with Gaussian 2009, Rev.A02.62 The density functional theory (DFT) level B3LYP/6-31G*
was used for geometry optimization, while a semiempirical ZINDO/S
method63 was adopted to describe the electronically
excited states. For compound 2, several ion pair configurations
were used as starting points. They all converged to two configurations
with iodide anion in the molecular plane. Out of those, the lowest
energy one was used for the spectral predictions (the iodide was replaced
with fluoride). The 2PA spectra of 1 and 2 were calculated with an in-house script64,65 implementing the sum over states (SOS) formalism66 with six excited states and empirical broadening parameter,
Γ = 0.1 eV. Following the previously proposed strategy,51 the empirical parameters (common for both chromophores
and equal to pσ = 1.266 and pπ = 0.530) were adjusted in modified Gaussian
code to fit the longest observed wavelengths in the 1PA spectra.

2.5 Cell Culture and Incubation
To estimate
the cytotoxicity of compound squaraine 1 and 2, HeLa cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin at
37 °C, in a 95% humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning, USA) at a concentration
of 5 × 103 cells/well for 48 h. Next, HeLa 116 cells
were incubated with different concentrations of compound 1 or 2 for an additional 22 h. After that, 20 μL
of Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One solution reagent was added into each
well followed by incubation for 2 h additionally. The respective absorbance
values were measured on a Tecan Infinite M200 PR plate reader spectrometer
at 490 nm to determine the relative amount of formazan produced. Cell
viabilities were calculated based on the following eq 2: 2  where Abs490nmS is the absorbance of the cells incubated
with
different concentrations of the dye solutions, Abs490nmD is the absorbance of cell-free
well containing only dye at the investigated concentration, Abs490nmC is the absorbance
of the cells only incubated in medium, and Abs490nmD2 is the absorbance of the
cell-free well.

2.6 One- and Two-Photon Fluorescence
Microscopy
Imaging
HeLa cells were placed onto poly-d-lysine
coated coverslips in 24-well plated at the density of 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated for 48 h. The investigated squaraine 1 solution was diluted to the concentration of 40 μM,
and squaraine 2 solution was diluted to the concentration
of 10 μM, respectively. After 2 h incubation, the solutions
were extracted and the coverslipped cells were washed abundantly with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (2×). After incubation
with medium containing 1 μg/mL Hoechst for nucleic acid staining,
cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS buffer at
room temperature for 10 min. The fixing agent was extracted and washed
(2×) with PBS. A fresh solution of NaBH4 (1.0 mg/mL)
in PBS buffer was used to treat the fixed cells for 10 min (2×)
to reduce the autofluorescence. The coverslipped cells were then washed
with PBS buffer (2×), deionized water (1×), and mounted
on microscope slides using an antifade mounting media (Prolong Gold)
for imaging.

Fluorescence cell images were obtained on an inverted
microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a Q-Imaging-cooled CCD and
a 100 W mercury lamp. The TexRed filter cube (Ex: 562/40 nm; DM: 593
nm; Em: 624/40 nm) was used to match the excitation wavelength of
squaraine 1 or 2 and to capture most of
its emission profile. A customized filter cube (Ex: 377/50 nm; DM:
420 nm; Em: 460/40 nm) was used for the nucleic acid imaging.

Two-photon fluorescence images were recorded with a Bruker Ultima
fluorescence microscopy system equipped with a Coherent Mira 900F
laser source (76 MHz, mode-locked, 200 fs pulse width). The fs laser
excitation was tuned to 820 nm in order to achieve the peak of fluorescence.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Linear
Photophysical Properties and Photochemical
Stability of 1 and 2
The steady-state
1PA spectra of new symmetrical 1 and unsymmetrical 2 squaraine derivatives exhibited similar sharp and narrow
main absorption bands at ∼640–680 nm (Figure 2, curves 1) with maximum extinction
coefficient of εmax ≈ (1.5–1.8) ×
105 M–1 cm–1 (see Table 1), which is typical
for symmetrical squaraine structures with absorption maxima in the
600–700 nm spectral range.24,30,33 This means that the symmetry of the main π-electron
system in 2 is not noticeably affected by the charged
substituent in the molecular structure, while a weak solvatochromic
behavior of the absorption spectra was observed (Table 1). Aggregation effects of 1 and 2 were negligible in all employed solvents
with solute concentrations C ≤ 10–3 M. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of 1 and 2 (Figure 2, curves (2)) exhibited relatively small Stokes shifts, typical for
symmetrical squaraines,20,33,37 and were independent of excitation wavelength, λex, over the entire absorption range. The values of the fluorescence
quantum yields, Φfl, were strongly dependent on solvent
polarity (see Table 1) without any dependence on λex and no violations
of Kasha’s rule56 were observed.
Taking into account similar shapes and spectral positions of the absorption
and emission spectra of the new squaraines in different solvents,
nearly equal extinction coefficients, and strong dependence of Φfl on solvent polarity, it can be assumed that solvation processes
mainly affect the radiationless intramolecular transitions in 1 and 2 without noticeable influence on the radiative
transition dipoles. Both compounds exhibited single-exponential fluorescence
decay in all solvents with characteristic lifetimes, τfl, in the range 0.8–1.7 ns. The values of τfl can be calculated based on the Strickler–Berg approach67 and corresponding lifetimes (τflcal) are presented
in Table 1. According
to these data, experimental and calculated values are in acceptable
agreement with each other, as evidenced by good mirror symmetry between
absorption and fluorescence spectra and small changes in the optimized
molecular geometry of 1 and 2 under electronic
excitation.68

(orientation polarizability),
Δf = (ε – 1)/(2ε + 1) –
(n2 – 1)/(2n2 + 1), where ε and n are the dielectric
constant and refraction index of the solvent, respectively.56

The
excitation anisotropy spectra of 1 and 2, r(λ) = r0(λ)/(1
+ τfl/θ) (see Section 2.2), were measured in solvents of different
viscosity (Figure 3, curves 1–3); the resulting data along with linear photophysical
parameters are presented in Table 1, revealing the nature of the main absorption bands,
relative orientations of the transition dipoles, rotational correlation
times, θ, and effective rotational volumes, V. The nearly constant value of anisotropy in the main 1PA band (i.e.
≈600–700 nm) is evidence of a single electronic transition
S0 → S1 of 1 and 2 in this spectral range (S0 and S1 are the
ground and first excited electronic state, respectively).69 The values of fundamental anisotropies, r0(λ), were measured in viscous solvents
(i.e., pTHF and glycerol at room temperature), where rotational depolarization
processes are negligible and r0(λ)
≈ r(λ). The maximum value of r0(λ) is determined by the angle, α,
between the absorption (S0 → S1) and
emission (S1 → S0) transition dipoles
and can be expressed as r0 = (3 cos2 α – 1)/5.56 Relatively
high values of r0 ≈ 0.35–0.37
in the main absorption bands are supportive of a close to parallel
orientation of the corresponding absorption and emission transition
dipoles of 1 and 2 (i.e., α ≤
13–17°). In this case, it is possible to estimate relative
orientations of the absorption dipoles S0 → Sn (Sn are higher
excited electronic states).70 Dramatic
changes in the excitation anisotropy spectra of 1 and 2 in the short wavelength range (λex <
550 nm) reflect the sufficiently different orientation of the S0 → Sn transition dipoles
relative to S0 → S1 (25° < α
< 50°). The observed maximum (for 1) and minimum
(for 2) at ∼350 nm are in good agreement with
the spectral position of the corresponding weak short wavelength absorption
bands (see insets in Figure 3), and indicate the relatively small (α ≈ 20°)
and large (α ≈ 50°) angles between S0 → Sn and S0 →
S1 transition dipoles for 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 3 (a) Compound 1: normalized 1PA spectra (4),
steady-state
excitation anisotropy spectra in pTHF (1), THF (2), and DCM (3); inset,
steady-state excitation spectra; (b) compound 2: normalized
1PA spectra (4), steady-state excitation anisotropy spectra in glycerol
(1), DMSO (2), and ACN (3); inset, steady-state excitation spectra.

As seen in the data for both compounds 1 and 2 in Table 1, the values of the rotational correlation time, θ,
exhibit
nearly linear dependence on solvent viscosity, η, and a correspondingly
weak dependence of the effective rotational volume, V, on solvent properties in accordance with θ = η·V/kT. This suggests that for each squaraine
dye, nearly the same volumetric shapes of the solvated molecular structure
are formed in different solvents.

The photostability of 1 and 2 were characterized
by an absorption method detailed previously,58 and corresponding photodecomposition quantum yields, Φph, were determined using eq 1 with data presented in Table 1. According to these data, neutral squaraine 1 exhibited sufficiently high photostability, Φph ≈ 10–6, comparable to the corresponding
values of laser dyes.71,72 In contrast, the photodecomposition
processes for charged squaraine 2 were much more efficient
in all employed solvents (Φph ≈ 10–4); however, this level of stability is still acceptable for its practical
application in bioimaging.73

3.2 2PA and Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
of 1 and 2
The investigation of
the 2PA properties of squaraines 1 and 2 were performed over a broad spectral range (740–1400 nm)
using an open aperture Z-scan technique59 with the corresponding degenerate spectra presented
in Figure 4 (curves
1, 2). We use different solvents because of different solubility and
higher concentration which is important in Z-scan
measurements. We know that solvatochromic effects are not strong for
the investigated squaraines, and we can expect that 2PA spectra do
not exhibit a strong dependence on solvent polarity. Accordingly,
the 2PA spectra exhibited two well-defined bands at ≈600 and
≈380 nm for 1, and ≈620 and ≈500
nm for 2. The observed long wavelength, weak 2PA maxima
(δ2PAmax < 100 GM) are typical for centrosymmetrical squaraine derivatives
and can be assigned to the spectral position of the asymmetric vibrational
modes of the main linear absorption band.33,74 It also means, that the shape of the main π-electron system
of 2 is sufficiently close to the centrosymmetric structure,
and the charged, nonconjugated substituent does not play a substantial
role in the corresponding nonlinear optical properties.

Figure 4 Degenerate
2PA (1, 2) and normalized steady-state 1PA (1′,
2′) spectra of 1 in THF (1, 1′) and 2 in ACN (2, 2′).

The values of 2PA cross-sections noticeably increase in the short
wavelength region up to δ2PAmax ≈ 420 GM and δ2PAmax ≈ 260
GM for 1 and 2, respectively. These 2PA
maxima are related to two-photon allowed S0 → Sn electronic transitions, as can be concluded
from the steady-state excitation anisotropy spectra (Figure 3, curves (1)) and very weak
1PA efficiency in this spectral range. It should be mentioned that
the δ2PAmax for 1 and 2 are smaller than previously
reported values for symmetrical squaraine derivatives.12,20 Based on a simple three-level model for 2PA processes,75 this can be explained by the relatively small
extinction coefficients, ε(λabmax), and corresponding reduced values
of the related transition dipoles for S0 → S1 transitions,  (μ01 in debye, ν
in cm–1, λ in cm).76 The potential of 1 and 2 for application
in laser scanning fluorescence microscopy techniques can be estimated
using a “figure of merit”, FM = δ2PA·Φfl/Φph ≈ 106 to 108, which is comparable with
known two-photon fluorescent molecular probes for bioimaging.33,77

Excited-state absorption (ESA) and fast relaxation processes
in
the ground and excited states of 1 and 2 were investigated using a femtosecond transient absorption pump–probe
technique under excitation in the main long wavelength 1PA band (λex = 650 nm). Temporal dependences of the induced optical density,
ΔD, on the delay between pump and probe pulses,
τD, were obtained over a broad spectral range, and
corresponding dependences, ΔD(τD), along with the transient absorption spectra, are presented in Figures 5 and 6. The main ESA bands were observed in the short wavelength
region at ∼450–530 nm (for 1) and ∼500–570
nm (for 2) that are typical for symmetrical squaraines
with λabmax at ∼600–700 nm.33,34,37 It should be mentioned that gain (i.e., optical amplification via
stimulated emission) is not possible in the spectral range λ
< 600 nm, and saturable absorption (SA) is negligible because of
a weak linear absorption at λ < 570 nm for both molecules.
Observed negative changes in the optical densities (i.e., ΔD < 0) in the spectral range of 580–680 nm for 1 and 600–700 nm for 2 are related to
SA processes and some possible inputs of gain in the corresponding
fluorescence contours (Figure 6c,d, curves (3)). Negative values of ΔD for λ ≥ 680 nm (for 1) and λ ≥
700 nm (for 2) are mainly determined by the gain phenomena.
No superluminescence or lasing was observed for these squaraines,
presumably because of their relatively low-fluorescence quantum yields
(see Table 1). Fast
but weak relaxation processes were observed for 1 in
DCM with a characteristic time of 4–5 ps (Figure 6a) that can be related to solvent
reorganization phenomena in low-viscosity solvents after S0 → S1 excitation.56,78 By contrast,
the charged squaraine 2 did not exhibit any fast relaxation
in the S1 excited electronic state, and after excitation
the value of ΔD relaxed to zero in accordance
with its nanosecond fluorescence lifetime, τfl.

3.3 Electronic
Structure Analysis
The
electronic transitions of 1 and 2 were described
based on a ZINDO/S//DFT theoretical approach (see Section 2.4). The optimized molecular
geometry, essential molecular orbitals, and calculated parameters
of the lowest singlet excited electronic states of 1 and 2 are presented in Figures 7 and 8 and Table 2, respectively. Optimized molecular
geometries of 1 and 2 were obtained for
the S0 ground-electronic state and revealed a nearly planar
configuration of the central conjugated molecular core. Two intramolecular
hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups and central squaraine oxygens
were predicted in 1. Deduced from Figures 7b and 8b, the structure
of the conjugated π-electron system of the charged compound 2 is close to centro-symmetric, which is in agreement with
the experimentally observed spectral shape and position of the main
long wavelength 1PA contour.

The calculated parameters of the lowest excited states
and oscillator
strengths of the corresponding electronic transitions (see Table 2) revealed a good
correlation with experimental data.

It should be mentioned that
the linear 1PA spectra of 1 and 2 were acceptably
described by the theoretical
approach employed without taking into account vibrational modes of
the squaraine structures. Calculated long wavelength electronic bands
of 1 and 2 are well-separated from others
(Figure 9) and can
be assigned to corresponding single electronic S1 states
in the 550–700 nm spectral range (Table 2). This is experimentally confirmed by the
constant values of anisotropy in the range of the main 1PA bands (see Figure 3, curves 1). The
degenerate 2PA spectra of 1 and 2 were calculated
using the SOS approach66 with 6 electronic
states and presented in Figure 9. The obtained 2PA spectra with maximum δ2PAmax ≈ 350–450
GM are in acceptable agreement with the experimental ones (Figure 4, curves 1, 2), except
for the blue shift of the calculated 2PA maximum for 2 and longer wavelength, weak 2PA bands in the spectral range of two-photon
forbidden transitions (i.e., one-photon allowed 1PA bands). These
transitions can be experimentally observed for centrosymmetric molecules
because of the vibronic interaction with the nonsymmetric vibrational
mode.33 It is interesting to mention that
in contrast to strictly centrosymmetric squaraine 1,
calculated electronic parameters of unsymmetrical 2 reveal
nonzero δ2PAmax in the main long wavelength 1PA band, while all its linear
spectral properties strongly suggest a nearly centrosymmetric structure
for 2.

spectra of 1 (a) and 2 (b).

3.4 Cell Viability Measurement
To ascertain
the potential utility of fluorescent probe squaraine 1 and 2 for fluorescence microscopy, their viability
was evaluated using HeLa cells via the MTS assay (Figure 10).79,80 After 24 h incubation with various concentrations, HeLa cells exhibited
relative high viability with concentration up to 40 μM for squaraine 1, and 10 μM for squaraine 2. The data
indicated that both squaraine 1 and 2 have
low cytotoxicity over a concentration range of 0.5–40 μM
and 0.625–10 μM, respectively, appropriate for cell imaging.

and 2 (b).

3.5 One-
and Two-Photon Cell Bioimaging with New
Squaraines
On the basis of cell viability test results, 30
μM squaraine 1 and 10 μM squaraine 2 in solution were used for fluorescence cell imaging for
the HeLa cell line.81,82 As presented in Figure 11, cells incubated with compound 1 exhibited bright fluorescence in the cytoplasm area. In
comparison, dye accumulation surrounding the nucleus area was observed
for cells incubated with squaraine 2 (Figure 12). Fluorescence microscopy
imaging results indicate that both compound 1 and 2 have great potential in the application of in vivo bioimaging.

To further investigate the potential use of compound 2 in imaging studies, two-photon fluorescence microscopy in vitro
cell imaging was conducted.82,83 As presented in Figure 13, HeLa cells incubated
with 10 μm compound 2 exhibited bright fluorescence
in the perinuclear area, consistency with the one-photon image result.
The excitation wavelength employed in 2PFM imaging experiments was
820 nm, which is in the NIR window, facilitating deeper penetration
compared with typical one-photon excitation in the visible range.
This result and low cytotoxicity demonstrated that the squaraine 2 is a promising candidate for in vivo imaging studies.

fs pulse width, Ex: 820 nm; Em: 624/40 nm).

4 Conclusions
Linear photophysical, photochemical,
and nonlinear optical properties
of new squaraines 1 and 2 were comprehensively
investigated in liquid media at room temperature. The neutral centrosymmetric 1 and unsymmetric derivative with charged nonconjugated substituent 2 exhibited very close linear spectral parameters, including
relatively narrow and sharp absorption and fluorescence peaks with
small Stokes shifts and only weak dependence on solvent polarity.
The nonconjugated charged substituent in 2 did not noticeably
change the symmetry of the main π-electron system, but dramatically
decreased its photostability. The steady-state excitation anisotropy
spectra of 1 and 2 revealed only one electronic
transition S0 → S1 in the main long wavelength
1PA band and its nearly parallel orientation to the corresponding
emission transition dipole S1 → S0 that
is similar to symmetrical squaraine derivatives.33,37 The degenerate 2PA spectra of new squaraines with cross-sections
of δ2PAmax ≈ 260–420 GM at the maxima were obtained by an open
aperture Z-scan method over a broad spectral range
using femtosecond excitation, revealing two well-defined 2PA bands
for each squaraine. The most intense ESA spectra of 1 and 2 were found in the short wavelength range, 450–550
nm, while fast relaxation processes in the excited state were observed
for neutral squaraine 1 with a characteristic time of
4–5 ps. Quantum chemical calculations of the main electronic
parameters of these two squaraine derivatives, including 1PA and 2PA
spectra, were performed with the ZINDO/S//DFT level of theory. We
found acceptable agreement with the experimental data, except for
the spectral position of the main 2PA peak for 2 and
weak 2PA intensity in the main one-photon allowed absorption band
of 1 and 2.

The one-photon fluorescence
imaging results demonstrated the potential
ability of squaraine 1 and 2 that can be
applied in the bioimaging study. In particular, HeLa cells incubated
with compound 2 exhibited bright fluorescence upon two-photon
excitation which indicates that this compound is also a promising
candidate for two-photon fluorescence imaging studies.

The linear
photophysical and nonlinear optical properties of the
new squaraines, acceptable photostability (FM > 106), and preliminary two-photon fluorescence
bioimaging with 1 and 2 suggest their potential
for use as fluorescence contrast agents in laser scanning fluorescence
microscopy imaging applications.
