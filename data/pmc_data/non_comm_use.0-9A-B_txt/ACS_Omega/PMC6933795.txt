Droplets of n-hexadecane were observed
to shrink
under ultraviolet (365 nm) and spread under blue light (475 nm) irradiation
on an aqueous solution of photosensitive surfactant AzoTAB. We demonstrate
that the change of wettability of n-hexadecane droplet
on the solution depends on the change of oil–water interface
tension. According to the addition of ethanol into the substrate,
the change of relative diameter ΔD/D exceeds 20%, much larger than the system without ethanol.
With light-emitting diode (LED) light as a sole power source, without
any other triggers, we provide a contactless and isothermal method
to realize photocontrolled alternative spreading and shrinking of
a droplet on a liquid surface, which provides a basis for a chromocapillary-based
optical zoom liquid lens.

1 Introduction
The spreading coefficient
is usually used for describing the mechanisms
of one liquid spreading on the surface of another, which is defined
as S = σw – (σo + σow) (σw, σo, and σow refer to the air–water surface
tension, the air–oil surface tension, and the oil–water
interface tension, respectively). It is a thermodynamics criterion
to distinguish different types of wetting (for the case of short-range
forces): a complete wetting regime where a drop spreads out into a
molecular-thickness membrane with S > 0 and a
partial
wetting regime where a drop spreads into a finite liquid lens with S < 0.1 If the spreading coefficient S changes and keeps negative value S <
0, the partial-wetting droplet would extend for ΔS > 0 and shrink for ΔS < 0.2 Therefore, the change of spreading coefficient
(ΔS) in a system would lead to the change of
wettability and
the motion of contact line, and it can be realized by adjusting the
relevant interface tension in this formula. Until now, there have
been many methods to induce the change of interfacial tension, which
are summarized into three categories including creating surface micro-/nanostructure,
controlling chemical composition (or chemical components concentration),3−5 or using external field stimuli.

For solid substrates, the
studies on special surface with micro-/nanostructures
developed rapidly, especially natural interfaces including lotus leaves,
water-strider legs, and the elytra of aquatic beetles, etc.6−8 Besides, various approaches for the preparation of fine surface
geometrical structures were proposed, such as template synthesis,9 phase separation,10 electrochemical deposition,11 electrohydrodynamics,12 crystallization control,13 chemical vapor deposition,14 self-assembly,15 and so on. In addition,
chemical component concentration gradients can be generated in many
ways including asymmetric dissolution (for instance, in the “camphor
boat” experiment),16 electrochemical
control,17,18 interfacial chemical reaction,19 pH gradient,20 etc.
Undoubtedly, there are various methods to adjust interface tension
but, nonetheless, these methods are usually irreversible. To realize
the controllable wetting and tunable interface tension, the strategy
of using external stimuli is developed. The most common external stimulus
is based on thermal (thermocapillary effect),21−25 electrical (electrowetting effect),26−30 electrochemical effect,31 etc. The thermal-capillary
effect is based on a thermal-induced change of interface tension.
Temperature gradients were exploited to generate interfacial gradients
which can induce interfacial liquid flow toward higher interfacial
tension. The other well-known example is the electrowetting effect
that the liquid–solid interfacial tension is electrostatically
controlled. The contact angle (CA) and interface tension of the conducting
liquid on a nonconductive surface are varied by applying a potential
difference between the liquid and the surface.

In recent years,
light irradiation is studied as an important external
stimulus to switch surface wettability reversibly. Under ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation, various light-responsive inorganic oxides and organic
polymers could change from large contact angles (CAs) to relatively
low CAs and return to their original state in darkness or under visible
light. The first type of substrates is light-responsive inorganic
oxides. The titanium dioxide (TiO2) substrates were first
found to have a photosensitive effect. Their photosensitive wettability
was reported by Fujishima et al. in 1997,32 and relevant research about wetting behaviors on titanium dioxide
(TiO2) were carried out over the next few years.33,34 Moreover, reversible wettability transition in complex environments,
such as underwater or oil, draw people’s attention. Switchable
underwater superoleophobicity–superoleophilicity on laser-modified
titanium surfaces was reported in 2015.35 Recently, Yang et al. reported a fast optical induced wetting states
transition surface achieved by atomic layer deposition of ZnO on micropillared
glass substrate surfaces, enabling tens of seconds transitions for
a wetting/dewetting cycle, shortened from an hour as typically reported.36 The other kind of photosensitive wettability
on solid substrate is achieved by the organic compound layer with
photochromic moiety. For instance, incorporation of azobenzene into
a solid surface composition provides photodependent wettability.37−40 After that, azobenzene containing surfactants were developed rapidly,
which played an important part in recent researches.

In comparison
with the photosensitive solid substrate, it could
be imaged that if a liquid contained photosensitive organic matter
with photochromic functional groups, the interfacial characterization
could be controlled by light illumination with different wavelengths.
In terms of mechanism, chromocapillary effect is a light-induced Marangoni
effect, which was first reported by Diguet in 2009.41 In recent years, photosensitive surfactants modified with
an azobenzene moiety have played the role of a transducer mediating
between different states of size, shape, surface energy, and spatial
arrangement of various nanoscale soft-material systems.42 AzoTAB is one kind of most commonly used photosensitive
surfactant containing an azobenzene moiety. It is in a trans, apolar
configuration under dark or blue light, while it isomerizes into cis,
polar configuration under UV condition. Both isomers can be easily
and quickly converted from trans to cis or cis to trans upon UV (365
nm) and blue light (475 nm), respectively.43 The trans isomer exhibits a higher affinity for the surface than
the cis isomer, which is easier to desorb from the surface.44 Photosensitive surfactants are extensively applied
in fields of photomanipulation of liquids,41,45−47 fundamental investigations in biology,48,49 physics,50−52 or chemistry.53−55 They provide a foundation to
realize reversible photoisomerization of molecules by incorporating
an azobenzene moiety into a molecule. These two different molecule
polarities would lead to two different molecule behaviors. Therefore,
this kind of photosensitive surfactant molecules offers a new possibility
that a macroscopic one-way physical process might be tuned and reversed
by light irradiation with different wavelengths.

In this article,
we are going to introduce a noncontacting method
to adjusting interface tension in an isothermal and wavelength-dependent
manner based on “chromocapillary effect”. It is driven
by surface tension gradient similar to the thermocapillary effect,
but the only difference is that the presence of the photosensitive
surfactant rather than temperature drives it. We find that UV/blue
light can be used to adjust the spreading coefficient S to control wetting behavior of a microliter-sized n-hexadecane droplet on the surface of AzoTAB solution. We observed
alternative shrinking and spreading of n-hexadecane
droplet under UV and blue light, respectively. It is attributed to
different interfacial properties under UV and blue light, which depend
on the different adsorption properties of two isomers (trans or cis).
Based on the principle of thermodynamics, we use the spreading coefficient
to explain this phenomenon preliminarily, which may provide a potential
method for a chromocapillary-based optical zoom liquid lens.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
N-hexadecane
(purity AR 98%, ρ = 0.77 g/cm3, viscosity μ
= 3.451 mpa·s, surface tension σ = 26.8 mN/m at 20 °C)
was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation in Shanghai, China.
The deionized water was produced by a MilliQ Academic filtering system,
Millipore Inc. To obtain a light-sensitive surface, a cationic photosensitive
azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide surfactant (AzoTAB) was dissolved
in the aqueous substrate.

2.2 Experimental Methods
N-hexadecane is chosen as a floating droplet owing to its nonvolatility,
chemical stability, insolubility in water, especially its negative
spreading coefficients in pure water (S = −2.5
mN/m), and not completely spreading in low-concentration surfactant
solution. Therefore, we could produce a macroscopic floating film
on an aqueous substrate. Besides, n-hexadecane could
hardly adsorb near-ultraviolet light (365 nm in our experiment), which
would not generate the thermal effect.

To obtain a light-sensitive
surface, a cationic photosensitive azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide
surfactant (AzoTAB) was dissolved in the aqueous substrate. We prepared
1 mM AzoTAB aqueous solution, which is below the critical micelle
concentration of AzoTAB in water (CMC = 12.6 and 14.6 mM for trans-
and cis-AzoTAB molecules, respectively56). The experimental setup consists of a 660 nm coaxial parallel light
source, 0.11× telecentric lens, and a CCD camera for direct observation,
as shown in Figure 1. After an alternative UV/blue light stimulus, we observed the floating
oil film shrinking and spreading, respectively.

Figure 1 Sketch of the experimental
setup used for the observation of droplet
wetting. The solution could be irradiated by UV/blue light using the
surface light source above the observation setup. The relevant data
are listed as follows: surface tension of air–oil, σo = 27.8 mN/m; air–water, σw = 57.9
mN/m; oil–water, σow = 33.9 mN/m; and spreading
coefficient S = σw – (σo + σow) = −2.8 mN/m.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Light-Driven Shrinking and Spreading on AzoTAB
Solution
A 10 μL droplet is deposited on the surface
of 1 mM aqueous AzoTAB solution; then, it rapidly spreads and reaches
the equilibrium state with a diameter of 36.65 mm (9.5 μm calculated
thickness) (Figure 2a). After the first 120 s UV irradiation, the contact line of the
film slowly retreats inward at an average speed of 0.025 mm/s, and
a smaller film with a diameter of 33.385 mm forms (Figure 2b). Next, after the 180 s exposure
to blue light, the oil film spreads slowly at an average speed of
0.017 mm/s and forms a bigger film with a diameter of 36.75 mm (Figure 2c). In these two
processes, the maximum of the relative change in diameter ΔD/D is just about 8.9% for UV and 9.3%
for blue light. Here, in spite of the small relative change rate of
the diameter, we realize the tunable spreading and shrinking process
by light stimulus. However, the relative change in diameter ΔD/D is always less than 10%. It is a crucial
problem as to how to get a larger relative change in diameter.

Figure 2 Three successive
states of 10 μL of n-hexadecane
on 1 mM AzoTAB solution is shown: (a) initial state; (b) the state
after 120 s UV irradiation; and (c) the state after 180 s blue light
irradiation. The solid line is the initial position of the contact
line, and the dotted lines represent where it was in the previous
state. Scale bar is 10 mm.

In our experiment, wetting transition occurs during
the spreading
process. When the droplet touches the solution surface, the initial
spreading coefficient is positive (S = +8.7 mN/m),
and the droplet starts to spread as an oil film. At a later point,
we observed that the spreading process stopped, and this indicates
that S turns to a negative value (S < 0) based on the definition of S. Between the
two states, there is a transition from S > 0 to S < 0, which is caused by the change of air–solution
surface tension with its area compressed. We added 10 μL of
droplets to four different diameter containers containing 1 mM AzoTAB
solution (see Supplementary experiment in the Supporting Information). We found that the larger the diameter
of the container, the larger the spreading area. This result shows
that wetting transition is attributed to the compressed air–solution
surface area by droplet spreading. Moreover, it also suggests that
there may be an invisible thin film around the finite oil film, which
would affect the wettability.

Here, the n-hexadecane
droplet forms a finite
oil film on the substrate, and the initial spreading coefficient S is positive (S = +8.7 mN/m). In relevant
reference, it is called pseudopartial wetting configuration, which
is an equilibrium state composed of a thin oil film coexisting with
the lens of the oil (shown in Figure 3a).The air–water surface is replaced by the
oil–water and air–oil interface. In other words, oil–water
interfaces and their light response in this regime including A and
B in Figure 3a are
similar under uniform light irradiation. Therefore, there are almost
no resultant forces or interface tension gradient in this case. As
a result, photoresponsive wettability is difficult to realize in this
case. In our experiment, we can achieve only 10% relative change in
diameter at most.

Figure 3 Configuration of pseudopartial wetting without ethanol
and partial
wetting with 5% ethanol.

To realize a remarkable light-controllable wettability,
we add
ethanol into the substrate. We observe a smaller size of oil film
with S = −2.8 mN/m < 0, which is defined
as the partial wetting regime (shown in Figure 3b). The effect of ethanol is to decrease
the polarity of the substrate and spreading coefficient S (S < 0). In this regime, absence of excess oil
around the droplet, three interfaces coexist including air–water,
air–oil, and oil–water interfaces. The difference in
light response properties between oil–water and air–water
interface induces the interface tension gradient to drive the light-responsive
wettability.

Through our experiments, 5% in volume is an appropriate
concentration,
which could observe a remarkable light-driven wetting/dewetting process.
More details about the selection of ethanol concentration are analyzed
in the Support Information.

3.2 Enhanced Light-Driven Shrinking and Spreading
on AzoTAB Solution
We add 5% ethanol into 1 mM AzoTAB solution
and enhance the relative change of diameter ΔD/D. The four pictures in Figure 4a–d give the four successive states
of the oil film after the light irradiation. The initial state is
shown in Figure 4a,
and the spreading area of the droplet is smaller than that without
ethanol, as shown in Figure 2a. Same as the experiment above, the film shrinks under UV
light (Figure 4a,b)
and spreads under blue light (Figure 4b,c) (see the Supplementary video in the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Series of light-induced spreading and
shrinking processes of 10
μL of n-hexadecane droplet on 20 mL 1 mM photosensitive
surfactant solution are shown in (a–d). After 120 s UV irradiation,
the film shrinks from (a) to (b). Then, the film spreads after 180
s blue light irradiation and its state turns to (c). The evolution
of the film diameter with the illuminating time under alternative
120 s UV and 180 s blue light is shown in (e). The scale bar is 10
mm (the solid line and dashed lines represent the initial position
and the position of the previous state, respectively).

Figure 4e gives
three cycles of the shrinking and spreading processes. In general,
the addition of ethanol makes the oil film smaller but makes the relative
change in diameter ΔD/D greater.
The relative change in diameter ΔD/D exceeds 20%, obviously larger than the <10% in the
ethanol-free case. In Figure 4e, after the first exposure to UV light, the diameter of the
oil film was reduced from 17.28 to 12.8 mm, and the change was about
25.9% of the initial diameter in 120 s with its contact line moving
uniformly at an average speed of 0.036 mm/s. Next, when irradiated
with blue light, the diameter of the oil film increased from 12.8
to 15.8 mm. In this process, the speed of the contact line gradually
and slowly decreased, returning to the starting position. Next, another
two same cycles were completed under alternative UV and blue light
irradiation. According to the series of experiments, we effectively
improved the relative change in diameter (ΔD/D > 20%) by adding ethanol into the substrate,
compared with ΔD/D < 10%
without ethanol. Besides, it takes longer time to achieve the same
size of diameter change in the case of blue light (about 180 s) than
it does for UV (about 120 s), and the velocity of the spreading is
more slow in blue light. Next, we are going to study the mechanism
of light-driven spreading/shrinking and try to analyze the reason
for different moving speeds of contact line under UV or blue light.

3.3 Dynamic Surface and Interface Tension
First of all, we make an analysis of the equilibrium states before
and after light irradiation according to the principle of energy,
but we do not focus on the intermediate dynamics process during light
irradiation because no matter what dynamics process it goes through,
the principle of energy is satisfied and the derived results are always
valid. So, we do not have to analyze the intermediate process.

Based on the energy principle, the functional relationship between
droplet diameter D and spreading coefficient S is obtained (see Supplementary texts in Supporting Information), which is given in eq 1 1  We derive geometry parameters of the liquid
in the equilibrium state, which is independent of viscosity but depends
on the spreading coefficient S. It suggests that
we can tune the spreading coefficient S by light
irradiation to control the wetting and dewetting process. In the first
step, the solution was irradiated by UV light, and we notice that
the film shrinks because of the reduced spreading coefficient (ΔS < 0); but the film grows after blue light irradiation
as a result of the spreading coefficient increasing (ΔS > 0). The series of phenomena is attributed to the
change
of interfacial tension between two phases after light irradiation.

To verify this point of view mentioned above, we measured the air–solution
surface tension and n-hexadecane–solution
interface tension evolution with irradiation time (shown in Figure 5) using optical contact
angle measuring and contour analysis systems (Dataphysics, OCA15EC).
The pendant drop method was used in this experiment, analyzing the
shape of drops and deducing the surface tension by the Young–Laplace
equation.

Figure 5 Representative evolution of (a) interface tension between n-hexadecane film and AzoTAB substrate solution (1 mM AzoTAB
solution mixed with 5% ethanol in volume), (b) surface tension of
the 1 mM AzoTAB solution mixed with 5% ethanol, and (c) spreading
coefficient of the system, as functions of time.

The result in Figure 5a indicates that n-hexadecane–solution
interface
tension grows from 33.94 to 36.28 mN/m under UV, while it falls from
36.16 to 34.36 mN/m under blue light irradiation in 200 s. But, the
result in Figure 5b
suggests that the air–solution surface tension slowly grows
under both UV and blue light in 200 s with Δσw < 1 mN/m. Considering the definition of spreading coefficient S = σw – (σo +
σow), we calculate the spreading coefficient S in Figure 5c according to the data in Figure 5a,b. (Here, air–hexadecane surface tension σo is constant, equal to 26.8 mN/m, which we measure experimentally).
The spreading coefficient falls under UV with the shrinking behavior
of the film, while it grows under blue light with the film spreading.
The evolution of the spreading coefficient in Figure 5c is consistent with the film wetting behavior.

In other words, the change of the spreading coefficient (ΔS ≠ 0) means that there are interface tension gradients
near the contact line. The difference in light response properties
between oil–water and air–water interface induces the
interface tension gradient to drive the light-responsive wettability.
Under UV light irradiation, oil–water interface tension grows
significantly, but the changes of air–water and air–oil
surface tension are quite small. As a result, the direction of surface
tension gradient and contact line moving are radially inward. Contrary
to the former, the surface tension gradient and induced contact line
moving are radially outward under blue light irradiation. When the
light is turned off, the gradient disappears with the liquid keeping
a stationary equilibrium state.

3.4 Photoisomerization and Distribution of AzoTAB
Molecules on the Interfaces
The interface tension is an interface
property, which is affected by the adsorption and desorption of AzoTAB
surfactant molecules. When the surface is stimulated by UV light,
a part of adsorbed trans isomers convert into cis rapidly. With cis
molecules desorbing from the interface quickly, the surface coverage
or adsorbance decreases (Figure 6b). As a result, the interfacial tension of oil–water
interface increases,57 and the liquid shrinks
as the spreading coefficient decreases (ΔS <
0). For the situation under blue light, it is the opposite; the oil–water
interface adsorbance increases, and, as a result, the liquid spreads
with ΔS > 0 (Figure 6c). The change of polarity of AzoTAB molecules
would lead to different adsorption properties, which is reflected
in the change of interface tension and spreading coefficient S in macroscope.

Figure 6 Distribution of surfactants molecules on interface
is shown. (a)
Initial state without any light irradiation, (b) state after UV light
stimulation with cis molecules desorbing from the interface, and the
size of oil film becoming smaller, and (c) the state after blue light
stimulation with the trans molecules adsorbing to the interface and
the size of oil film becoming larger. The photoisomerization of AzoTAB
surfactant molecules is shown in the inset.

The velocity of spreading or shrinking depends
on different adsorption/desorption
speeds of two isomers of AzoTAB surfactant molecules. Cis isomers
can adsorb and desorb from the interface faster than trans isomers.
In relevant references, the cis isomer adsorbs 10 times faster than
the trans isomer, but the cis conformation also desorbs 300 times
faster.43 UV spectrophotometric measurements
showed that when the solutions are prepared under UV light (365 nm)
the solution contains 16% of trans isomers as compared with 66% of
trans isomers under monochromatic blue light (436 nm). Under UV light
irradiation, trans isomers convert into cis isomers (the fraction
of cis = 84% in the photostationary state) and desorb from the interface
quickly. Under blue light, the molecular configuration is dominated
by trans isomers (the fraction of trans = 66%), and trans isomers
adsorb to the interface more slowly than cis isomers. As a result,
the velocity of spreading is slower under blue light illumination
in macroscope.

3.5 Spreading Kinetics on Photosensitive Solution
To verify the above suppose about the distribution of surfactants
on the surface and identify the differences between the two surfaces
irradiated by UV and blue light, we performed another set of experiments.
A photosensitive solution substrate (without ethanol) is preilluminated
by UV or blue light for 5 min and, then, we deposited 10 μL
of n-hexadecane on it. As soon as the drop is released,
the surface of the supporting aqueous solution deforms. From that
moment, the droplet starts to spread rapidly and the position of the
contact line is recorded. The spreading speed of the contact line
is so high that the spreading process is less than 2 s.

Possible
power-law spreading dynamics could be revealed by plotting the radius
versus time on logarithmic scales, as shown in Figure 7. We observed a spreading process of an acceleration
followed by deceleration, rather than a clear scaling law with a constant
slope. The physical responses of experimental systems are often more
complex and, because of the interplay of various forces, only show
power-law-like spreading for finite time intervals. To be able to
make quantitative comparisons with existing work, we fit this data
with straight lines for finite time intervals during the rapid spreading.
We find that the average exponents are 0.47 < αblue < 0.65 for blue light regime and 0.27 < αUV < 0.43 for UV light regime.

Figure 7 Scaling law of oil droplet spreading on
photosensitive solution
substrate which is preilluminated by UV or blue light for 5 min. The
average scaling exponent for the situation preilluminated by blue
light is 0.559 according to linear fitting, which is represented by
the blue line (r ∝ t0.559), and 0.365 for the situation preilluminated by UV, which
is represented by the purple line (r ∝ t0.365). rd is defined
as the radius where its slope begins to decay.

We can contrast this result with power-law spreading
of a droplet
on a deep viscous support, for which r(t) ∝ t3/4 basing on viscous boundary
layer assumption. In this model, the surface tension gradient is balanced
by viscous forces, but gravity and inertia can be neglected.59 In addition, two other important results are r(t) ∝ t1/2 for the gravity–inertia spreading regime and r(t) ∝ t1/4 for
the gravity–viscous spreading regime.

For spreading on
blue light preilluminated substrate, 0.47 <
αblue < 0.65 indicates that gravity–inertia
spreading (r(t) ∝ t0.5) dominates at the beginning, and then it
quickly turns to surface tension–viscous regime (r(t) ∝ t0.75).
At the beginning, the spreading coefficient S is
positive (S = +8.7 mN/m), and so the resultant force
of interfacial tension in the horizontal direction is outward which
drives the droplet spreading. Before αblue reaches
0.75, the air–solution surface is compressed for droplet spreading
in a finite petri dish. Therefore, there is a possibility that the
adsorbance of surfactant molecules per unit area on the surface increases
with S decaying quickly during the compression process.
As a result, before αblue reaches 0.75, the driving
force (spreading coefficient) cannot drive the spreading and the contact
line brakes with αblue suddenly decaying to 0.03.
In other words, if the petri dish is large enough (absence of surface
compression), αblue would reach 0.75, and spreading
kinetics would become surface tension–viscous regime.

For spreading on UV light preilluminated substrate, the spreading
coefficient S is much smaller than that under blue
light (S = +3.0 mN/m), which could hardly drive the
spreading. Therefore, only gravity-driving regime exists such as gravity–inertial
or gravity–viscous regime. In our experiment, 0.27 < αUV < 0.43 indicates that gravity, inertia, or viscous force
dominates at the same time.

In addition, we find some differences
between the two regimes in Figure 7: (1) faster spreading
rate and larger equilibrium radius of the droplet for blue light regime,
which indicates a better wettability and a larger spreading coefficient S compared with UV regime; (2) a sudden and remarkable decline
of the scaling rate for blue light regime, but a relatively gentle
process for UV regime; (3) rdblue > rdUV (rd is defined as the radius where its slope begins to decay)
indicates Sblue > SUV, where Sblue and SUV are the spreading coefficients for blue and
UV light
regime, respectively. It is remarkable that the sudden brake of the
radius for blue light regime might be attributed to the higher surface
pressure around the droplet. With the droplet spreading, the air–water
surface is compressed rapidly, which induces higher surface pressure
and surfactant adsorbance per unit area. The sudden decline of scaling
rate for blue light regime also indicates that the adsorbance of surfactant
molecules (trans isomers) on the air–water surface is more
than that for UV regime, which is consistent with the previous research.43 Therefore, there is a relatively gentle deceleration
process for UV regime due to its low surface coverage of trans isomers.

4 Conclusions
To summarize, we have observed
tunable spreading and shrinking
of an oil droplet on a photocontrolled liquid substrate. Besides,
we effectively improve the relative change in diameter (ΔD/D > 20%) by adding ethanol into the
substrate,
compared with ΔD/D < 10%
without ethanol. This photocontrolled spreading and shrinking are
induced by the tunable spreading coefficient S, which
decreases under UV but increases under blue light. Power-law spreading
dynamics verifies that n-hexadecane has better wettability
on the surface with high coverage of trans surfactant molecules (irradiated
by blue light), while it is poor for the air–solution surface
with low coverage of trans surfactants (irradiated by UV light), due
to different fraction of conformers and the distribution of surfactant
molecules on the interface. The series of experiments provides a basis
for a chromocapillary-based optical zoom liquid lens. However, there
are still unclear and unsolved problems which may cause difficulties
in application. Long response time of the droplet (about 120 s with
the relative change in diameter of 20% in our experiment) and the
spreading/shrinking rate cannot be controlled very well. After many
times of alternative spreading and shrinking, the shape of the floating
film easily becomes irregular and asymmetric. How to shorten the response
time and control accuracy is a crucial topic in the future research
of a chromocapillary-based optical zoom liquid lens.
