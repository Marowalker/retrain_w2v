Polymeric nanocarriers have been
extensively used in medicinal
applications for drug delivery. However, intravenous nanocarriers
circulating in the blood will be rapidly cleared from the mononuclear
macrophage system. The surface physicochemical characterizations of
nanocarriers are the primary factors to determine their fate in vivo,
such as evading the reticuloendothelial system, exhibiting long blood
circulation times, and accumulating in the targeted site. In this
work, we develop a series of polyurethane micelles containing segments
of an anionic tripeptide, hydrophilic mPEG, and disulfide bonds. It
is found that the long hydrophilic mPEG can shield the micellar surface
and have a synergistic effect with the negatively charged tripeptide
to minimize macrophage phagocytosis. Meanwhile, the disulfide bond
can rapidly respond to the intracellular reduction environment, leading
to the acceleration of drug release and improvement of the therapeutic
effect. Our results verify that these anionic polyurethane micelles
hold great potential in the development of the stealth immune system
and controllable intracellular drug transporters.

Introduction
In recent years, drug
delivery nanocarriers, including polymeric
micelles, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and inorganic or other
solid particles, have been widely used for the diagnosis and therapy
of malignant tumors.1−4 The physicochemical properties of nanocarriers such as size, surface
hydrophobicity, and surface charge may affect their interaction with
blood components, leading to rapid recognition and elimination by
the mononuclear macrophage system (MPS), and hence influence the endurance
of blood circulation, biodistribution, and the accumulation at the
target sites.5−8 The hydrophilicity of the surface of nanocarriers is an important
factor to affect their fate in vivo. The grafting of hydrophilic poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) onto the surface of nanocarriers has been widely utilized
to increase the hydrophilicity of nanocarriers9 and create a thermodynamic shield,10,11 which can
counteract the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between
nanocarriers and opsonins or MPS, leading to minimization of the rapid
opsonization, suppression and elimination of the reticuloendothelial
system (RES), and a prolonged blood circulation time.12−16

The surface charge of nanocarriers is the primary factor that
determines
their stability and longevity in the blood circulation, the mechanism
and efficiency of cellular uptake, the bioavailability, and the therapeutic
effect in vivo. The negatively charged surface of nanocarriers can
help prolong the time of blood circulation and minimize the clearance
by MPS.17,18 For example, Yamamoto et al.19 verified that the negatively charged PEG–PDLLA
micelles can significantly minimize nonspecific uptake by the spleen
and liver due to the electrostatic repulsion between micellar and
cellular surfaces. Elci et al.20 demonstrated
that positively charged AuNPs were rapidly cleared from the blood
circulation, whereas the negatively charged and the neutral nanoparticles
circulated longer. Moreover, the negative surface charge of nanocarriers
could significantly minimize the bovine serum albumin adsorption compared
with positively charged samples.21,22

Desired
nanocarriers for drug delivery systems should be able to
overcome not only extracellular barriers, but also the intracellular
barriers.23 The design of stimuli-responsive
nanocarriers that release drugs in response to intracellular signals
has received great interest. In recent years, redox-responsive drug
delivery systems involving disulfide bonds have been developed for
cellular imaging24−26 or cell-specific drug release.27−30 The redox potentials in the cytoplasm
are distinctly discrepant between tumor and normal tissues due to
the different concentrations of glutathione (GSH) tripeptide, which
is the most abundant redox agent in the cytoplasm.31,32 It has been demonstrated that the intracellular GSH concentration
reaches up to 10 mM,33 while the concentration
drops to about 2–20 μM in the extracellular fluids.34 Furthermore, the GSH amount in tumor tissues
is at least 4-fold higher than that in the normal tissue in mice.35 The different reduction potentials in different
cell regions have been exploited for triggered disulfide bond cleavage,
thereby causing disintegration of micelles and drug unloading.

In our previous study, we have reported the construction of several
multifunctional polyurethane micelles as drug delivery systems.36−38 We have demonstrated that the cationic polyurethane micelles carried
out an effective internalization.39,40 However, the
positive surface charge of polyurethane micelles could accelerate
the elimination by macrophages and increase the accumulation in the
liver, spleen, and kidney.38,41−43 In this work, we aim to develop anionic polyurethane micelles containing
the hydrophilic PEG chain and disulfide bond, which can minimize the
recognition and elimination by RES owing to the electrostatic repulsion
and hydrophilic shell protection and respond to the redox potentials
in tumor cells, to improve the biodistribution and maintain the therapeutic
effect of polymeric micelles.

To provide the negative charge
of polyurethane, we designed and
synthesized a tripeptide chain extender (TCE), the sequence of which
is lysine–lysine–phenylalanine (Lys–Lys–Phe),
containing an anionic carboxyl group. l-Cystine diethyl ester
(CYSD) containing a disulfide is incorporated into the polyurethane
to provide redox stimuli sensitivity. Meanwhile, to better understand
the relationship between the anionic groups and mPEG chains of different
molecular weights, and clarify their influence on the physical, chemical,
and biological properties of micelles, polyurethanes with different
contents of TCE, mPEG, and disulfide bond were synthesized and systematically
characterized. These polyurethanes form micelles with a negatively
charged surface by self-assembly (Scheme 1). The self-assembly ability, stability in
the physiological environment, redox-stimulated response, drug loading,
and drug-release profile of these anionic micelles were investigated.
Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry
were performed to evaluate the cellular uptake and phagocytosis of
the micelles.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of the Tripeptide Chain Extender
To introduce
the negatively charged groups into the polyurethane micelles, the
tripeptide chain extender (TCE) was designed and synthesized. The
structure and synthetic route of the tripeptide are shown in Scheme 2. The sequence of
the tripeptide is Lys–Lys–Phe. Diamino groups of the
first lysine (Lys) in the sequence can ensure that the tripeptide
incorporated into the polyurethane skeleton as a chain extender, and
the carboxyl group from phenylalanine (Phe) provides a negative charge.

Scheme 2 Synthesis Route of the Tripeptide Chain Extender
Mass spectrometry was carried out to prove the successful
synthesis
of TCE as listed in the Materials and Methods section. The structure of the TCE was further confirmed by 1H NMR and FTIR spectra. As shown in Figure 1A, peaks at 7.16 ppm are assigned to the
benzene ring from Phe (−C6H5). The peaks
at 4.13, 4.03, and 3.15 ppm are attributed to the hydrogen protons
linked by chiral carbon atoms. The signals near 7.9 and 7.5 ppm are
assigned to the amide group (−CONH−). Signal peaks of
other hydrogen protons can be found as shown in Figure 1A.

Figure 1 (A) 1H NMR spectrum and (B) FTIR
spectrum of the tripeptide
chain extender. The solvent of 1H NMR is DMSO-d6.

In the FTIR spectrum (Figure 1B), the absorption
bands around 3448 and 3298 cm–1 are attributed to
vibrational modes associated with
the primary amine and secondary amine. The peak at 1631 cm–1 belongs to the C=O stretching, and the characteristic peaks
of the carboxyl group appear at 1560 and 1381 cm–1. The band near 700 cm–1 is assigned to the out-of-plane
bending mode of =C–H in benzene. These results indicate
that the tripeptide chain extender has been successfully synthesized.

Synthesis of Anionic Polyurethanes
To explore the effects
of different contents of anionic carboxyl groups and various molecular
weights of the hydrophilic shell in micelles on the phagocytosis by
macrophages, a series of polyurethanes were synthesized by changing
the feed ratio of TCE and the molecular weight of mPEG (Table 1). The polyurethanes are named
as TxC50mEy, in which T, C, and
mE represent TCE, CYSD, and mPEG, respectively; x represents the molar ratio of TCE and y represents
the molecular weight of mPEG. Polyurethanes without TCE or mPEG were
also prepared as control samples (T0C50mE1900 and T50C50mE0). As shown
in Table 1, the molecular
weights (Mn) of the polyurethanes range from 23 000 to 60 000
g/mol with relatively narrow distributions (PDI 1.28–1.67).

as TxC50mEy, where T is for tripeptide chain extender, C is for CYSD,
mE is for mPEG, x is for the molar fraction of the tripeptide chain
extender, and y is the molecular weight of mPEG, respectively.

b Molecular weights and molecular
weight distributions were determined by GPC.

To clarify the structure, Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectra of anionic
polyurethanes.
The characteristic proton shifts near 7.2 ppm result from the benzene
ring protons of the TCE (−C6H5). There
is no peak near 7.2 ppm in the spectrum of T0C50mE1900 without TCE.
The shift at 3.1 ppm is attributed to the methylene protons attached
to the disulfide bond (−CH2–S–S−).
The peaks of different methylene protons of the PCL segments are observed
at 1.32 ppm (−CH2CH2CH2−),
1.55 ppm (−CH2CH2CH2−),
2.26 ppm (−CH2COO−), and 3.96 ppm (−CH2O−), respectively. The chemical shifts of methylene
(−CH2–OCO−) and methyl protons (−CH3) in the ethoxyl group of LDI are at 4.44 and 1.18 ppm, respectively.
The methylene protons of the mPEG are found at 3.51 ppm. No mPEG peaks
are seen for the control sample T50C50mE0. The 1H NMR spectra
indicate that the polyurethanes with the different carboxyl groups
and various molecular weights of mPEG were successfully synthesized.

and (f) T0C50mE1900 in DMSO-d6. The chemical
structures of the main components for anionic polyurethanes are also
presented in this figure.

The FTIR spectra were used to characterize the specific chemical
groups in anionic polyurethanes. As shown in Figure 3, a broad stretching band around 3395 cm–1 is mainly attributed the N–H stretching vibration
associated with the amino groups in urethane. There are no peaks at
about 2200 cm–1 (stretching vibration of −N=C=O),
indicating that LDI has been completely reacted into urea or urethane
groups. In the carbonyl region of 1650–1750 cm–1, the strong peaks at approximately 1732 cm–1 are
assigned to the carbonyl (C=O) in LDI and PCL. The peak at
1650 cm–1 is assigned to the hydrogen-bonded carbonyl
of TCE and CYSD, while the control sample T0C50mE1900 without TCE
has a correspondingly lower single at 1650 cm–1.
Meanwhile, the absorption bands in the infrared fingerprint region
near 705 cm–1 caused by the benzene ring have obviously
enhanced with the incorporation of TCE. These results further demonstrated
that the polyurethanes had been successfully synthesized.

Preparation and Characterization of Anionic Polyurethane Micelles
To investigate the effects of the anion carboxyl groups on the
self-assembly behavior of the micelles, the size, size distribution,
ζ-potential, and morphology of the micelles in the physiological
environment were measured by DLS and TEM. The results obtained from
DLS are listed in Table 2. The size ranges from 84 to 137 nm with PDI 0.13–0.37. As
the molecular weight of mPEG increases, the micellar size shows an
obviously downward trend owing to the hydrophilicity improvement,
which is validated in our previous reports.44 All of the micelles show a surface negative potential from −5
to −33 mV. The absolute values of the ζ-potential decrease
as the mPEG segment chain grows as well as the TCE content decreases.
In particular, the longest chain of mPEG (Mn = 5000) completely shields
the carboxyl anion on the surface of micelles, the ζ-potential
of which is −5 mV, similar to the T0C50mE1900 micelles without
carboxyl groups. The shortest mPEG (Mn ≤ 500) has little ability
to cover anionic groups. Simultaneously, with the content of the carboxyl
anion decreased, the ζ-potentials of micelles grafted with mPEG1900
increased from −18.77 to −6.20 mV. As observed by TEM
(Figure 4), the morphologies
of representative anionic polyurethane micelles (T0C50mE1900 and T50C50mE1900)
display an irregular sphere and individual dispersion, and the diameters
are calculated to be about 100 nm according to the scale, which is
quite consistent with DLS results (Table 2). In addition, the incorporation of an anionic
tripeptide has slight influence on the morphology of micelles.

To further understand the distribution of the tripeptide
in the
micelle structure, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation
was carried out by a computer. Blue, red, green, and yellow colors
in the simulated structures of anionic polyurethane micelles represent
PCL, tripeptide, mPEG, and CYSD, respectively (Figure 5). It is found that mPEG-free T50C50mE0 can
still self-assemble into micelles but the particle size is not uniform.
As shown in Figure 5, the size and size distribution become smaller and narrower with
the increasing chain length of mPEG. In addition, TCE is found to
be mainly distributed between the PCL core and the mPEG shell, and
a small amount of TCE is buried into the PCL core, which might be
due to the structure of the tripeptide. In detail, the phenylalanine
can provide strong hydrophobicity, which improves the interaction
of TCE and the PCL core, while the two hydrophilic lysines prompt
TCE migration to the micellar surface. The distribution of the tripeptide
can explain why longer mPEG chains can completely shield the negative
surface charge of micelles.

micelles.
Blue, red, green, and yellow represent PCL, tripeptide, mPEG, and
CYSD, respectively.

To evaluate the effects
of anionic carboxyl groups on the stability
of micelles under physiological conditions, the size change of micelles
was monitored in PBS solution at 37 °C for 24 h (Figure 6). Apparently, it can be found
that the size of micelles without mPEG (T50C50mE0) changed significantly
from 60 to 80 nm. Other micelles display extreme stability in PBS
solution within 24 h. These results indicate that the mPEG segments
could provide micelles good steric stabilization, and the anionic
TCE with the carboxyl group cannot affect the stabilization of micelles
in the buffer solution.

for 24 h of incubation
at 37 °C in PBS solution (pH 7.4). Significance levels were set
at *P < 0.05. All data presented as mean ±
SD (n = 3).

The redox-stimulated response of the disulfide bond under a reductive
environment was evaluated by monitoring the size change of micelles
in PBS with 10 mM GSH. As shown in Figure 7, the size of the micelles containing disulfide
bonds exhibits a dramatic increase in 1 h, indicating that the disulfide
bond can respond to the reductive stimulus and rapidly cleave under
the 10 mM GSH environment.

micelles incubated

Drug Loading and Release
The chemotherapeutic drug
PTX was used to evaluate the drug-loading capacity of anionic polyurethane
micelles. Two drug-loading parameters of anionic polyurethane micelles,
LC and EE, are plotted in Figure 8A. All of the micelles have a good drug-loading capacity
with the same PTX feeding amount (10%); the maximum LC and EE are
∼6 and ∼50%, respectively. The incorporation of anionic
TCE cannot affect the drug-loading ability of anionic polyurethane
micelles. In addition, the size of micelles has basically no change
after the encapsulation of PTX except the size of T0C50mE1900 (Figure 8B).

(%) and encapsulation efficiency (%) of
PTX in anionic polyurethane micelles. (B) Size of anionic polyurethane
micelles containing PTX. Significance levels were set at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. All data are
presented as mean ± SD (n = 3).

To further study the release profiles of PTX-loaded anionic
polyurethane
micelles, we examined the PTX release under an imitated physiological
environment and reducing environment in vitro. As depicted in Figure 9A, there is a strong
correlation between the release rates of PTX and the length of mPEG
segments. The PTX accumulative release rates of T0C5mE1900 and T50C50mE1900
were about 60% within 120 h, while a serious initial burst release
in the profile of the T50C50mE0 occurred due to the lack of mPEG segments,
and the accumulative PTX release was near 100% after 120 h. This phenomenon
may confirm that the longer hydrophilic mPEG shell would inhibit PTX
release.44 In addition, T50C50mE0 without
mPEG is relatively unstable in PBS solution, which would be a reason
for the rapid drug release. As shown in Figure 9B, the release profiles of T50C50mE1900 and
T0C50mE1900 are almost the same under the physiological environment,
which indicates that anionic TCE has a slight impact on the release
profiles of polyurethane micelles. However, the release rates of T0C50mE1900
and T50C50mE1900 micelles were sharply increased in PBS with 10 mM
GSH, and the cumulative release amounts increased from ∼60
to ∼95%. It could be anticipated that a higher concentration
of GSH in tumor cells could trigger intracellular PTX release and
subsequently increase the cytotoxicity of micelles.

polyurethane micelles in PBS (pH 7.4) with or without 10 mM GSH solution.
Significance levels were set at *P < 0.05. All
data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3).

In Vitro Cellular Uptake
The analyses
on flow cytometry
and CLSM were carried out to evaluate the internalization efficiency
of anionic polyurethane micelles with a varying content of TCE and
mPEG with different molecular weights in tumor cells (HeLa). T50C50mE0
displayed the strongest fluorescence signal due to the lack of a hydrophilic
mPEG chain as a sheltered enclosure (Figure 10). Moreover, as shown in Figure 10, the fluorescence signal
decreased along with the increase of the length of the mPEG chain
or/and content of TCE. Evidently, the fluorescence intensity of FITC-labeled
anionic polyurethane micelles is observed at the cell membrane. Simultaneously,
the fluorescence signal is difficult to be observed in the cytoplasm
within 3 h of incubation (Figure 10B). Most of the anionic polyurethane micelles attach
to the cell membrane, which due to the longer hydrophilic mPEG chain
would provide the superior stabilization by steric repulsion. In addition,
TCE would supply the negative surface charge, which can inhibit the
internalization of anionic polyurethane micelles. Therefore, the polyurethane
micelles with mPEG segments and the anionic TCE can hardly enter HeLa
cells within 3 h. Future studies on incorporating the monoclonal antibody
through carboxylic acid reactions will be carried out to improve the
internalization by tumor cells.

micelles for 3 h.

In Vitro Cytocompatibility
and Antitumor Activity
To
assess the biocompatibility of anionic polyurethane micelles, L929
fibroblast cells were employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity by a CCK-8
cell viability assay. As shown in Figure 11A,B, the cell viability of all micelles
is higher than 85% even at a high concentration (0.1 mg/mL) within
72 h of incubation. It indicates that these anionic polyurethane micelles
have good biocompatibility. Moreover, these blank micelles also do
not inhibit the growth of tumor cells (HeLa cells) (Figure 11C,D).

Figure 11 Viability of L929 mouse
fibroblasts (A, B) and HeLa cells (C, D)
treated by drug-free anionic polyurethane micelles for 24 h (A, C)
and 72 h (B, D).

The antineoplastic potential
of the PTX-loaded anionic micelles
was investigated against HeLa cells in vitro by a CCK-8 cell viability
assay. The commercialized anticancer drug Taxol was set as a positive
control. The cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells is dependent on the length
of mPEG segments and the content of the anionic groups in the anionic
polyurethane micelles. As shown in Figure 12, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50’s) of T50C50mE0, T50C50mE500, T50C50mE1900, T50C50mE5000,
and Taxol were calculated to be 0.447, 1.377, 4.074, 8.054, and 0.088
μg/mL, respectively. Particularly, the IC50 of micelles with
a long mPEG chain (Mn ≥ 1900) is 10–20 times higher
than that of the micelles without an mPEG chain, which is because
a longer hydrophilic mPEG chain can effectively hamper cell uptake
of micelles as well as decrease the PTX release from polyurethane
micelles. On the other hand, micelles incorporated with the anionic
carboxyl groups have slightly increased the IC50 value from 3.664
(T0C50mE1900) to 4.074 (T50C50mE1900) μg/mL. The negatively
charged carboxyl groups could prevent the micelles from internalizing
into the tumor cells due to the electric repulsion between the micellar
surface and the cytomembrane. The lowest cytotoxicity of PTX-loaded
T50C50mE5000 can be associated with the synergistic effects of a longer
mPEG chain and the anionic carboxyl groups of the micelles.

of anionic polyurethane micelles against HeLa cells

values of various PTX formulations toward HeLa cells for 72 h of incubation.

Phagocytosis of Macrophages on Anionic Polyurethane
Micelles
Phagocytosis is one of the main mechanisms of the
innate immune
defense to remove and clear extraneous materials in the blood or tissue,
which would greatly reduce the bioavailability of drug delivery systems.
To evaluate the effect of anionic TCE and the hydrophilic mPEG segments
on the clearance of macrophage phagocytosis, the murine raw264.7 cells
were employed to study the phagocytosis (Figure 13). It was found that the fluorescent signals
of T50C50mE1900 and T50C50mE5000 were much weaker than those of T50C50mE500
and T50C50mE0 (Figure 13A,C). Moreover, the fluorescent intensity gradually darkened with
the increase of anionic TCE (Figure 13B,D). Importantly, the T50C50mE5000 micelles have not
been swallowed by macrophages within 3 h. These results indicate that
the hydrophilic mPEG chain and anionic TCE have a synergistic effect,
owing to the dual role of the electrostatic repulsion and hydrophilic
protection, against the elimination of micelles by macrophages. Therefore,
the negative surface charge as well as the mPEG segments have a great
ability to help the drug delivery system to escape the interception
by macrophages in the immune system. Such micelles contain disulfide
bonds, which would quickly respond to the GSH stimulation in tumor
cells, and thus can help accelerate the drug release at tumor cells
to improve the biodistribution and enhance the therapeutic effect.

polyurethane micelles for 1 h (A, B) and 3 h (C, D).

Conclusions
A series of anionic polyurethanes containing
anionic tripeptide
chain extenders and disulfide bonds have been designed and prepared,
and these polyurethanes can be self-assembled in an aqueous solution.
It was found that the longer mPEG chains can completely screen the
negative surface charge of micelles due to the TCE distributed between
the hydrophobic PCL core and the hydrophilic mPEG shell. The anionic
polyurethane micelles have good stability under the imitated physiological
environment. In addition, it is verified that the disulfide bond provided
by CYSD quickly responded to the GSH stimulation, leading to the disintegration
of micelles and acceleration of drug release at tumor cells. Moreover,
longer hydrophilic mPEG chains and a negatively charged micellar surface
have a synergistic effect on weakening the macrophage phagocytosis
as well as on the internalization by tumor cells, due to the electrostatic
repulsion and hydrophilic protection. Therefore, the anionic TCE and
hydrophilic PEG shell have great potential to help micelles evade
the MPS uptake, minimize the clearance of RES, prolong the blood circulation
time, and increase the accumulation at the tumor site. Future studies
on incorporating the monoclonal antibody through carboxylic acid reactions
will be carried out to simultaneously improve the immune evasion and
therapy efficacy of the anionic polyurethane micelles in vivo.

solution. The mixture solution was stirred for 1 h. Then, the methanol
was removed by vacuum rotary evaporation at 45 °C, after which
the pH of the mixture solution was adjusted to 3 using 1 M HCl. The
mixture solution was extracted by ethyl acetate three times, and the
organic layer was washed sequentially with saturated NaHCO3 solution, saturated NaCl solution, and deionized water, dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4 for 24 h, and filtered to obtain
Boc-Lys-acy (yield: 82%). Boc-Lys-acy and Phe-OMe were added into
the CH2Cl2. The pH value of the mixture solution
was adjusted to 7–8 using N-methylmorpholine,
and the temperature was decreased to ∼0 °C using the ice-water
bath. DCC and HOSU were added and the mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 48 h. After complete reaction, dicyclohexylurea (DCU)
was removed by filtration and the solution was washed sequentially
with 0.6 M citric acid, saturated NaHCO3 solution, saturated
NaCl solution, and deionized water, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 for 24 h, and then filtered. The solution was concentrated
with a rotary evaporator. Then, the solution of diethyl ether/petroleum
ether (v/v, 1:1) was added to recrystallize and obtain the product
of Boc-lys(acy)-Phe-OMe (yield: 81%). Boc-lys(acy)-Phe-OMe was dissolved
in ethyl acetate, and AcOEt/HCl was added dropwise into the mixture
solution to deprotect the BOC group. Then, the residual solvent in
the product was removed using vacuum rotary evaporation. A small amount
of menthol was added to dissolve the product, after which a large
amount of diethyl ether was added to precipitate and obtain the purified
product lys(acy)-Phe-OMe (yield: 88%). DCC and HOSU were added to
the CH2Cl2 solution of lys(acy)-Phe-OMe and
Boc-lysine, which was cooled in the ice-water bath to 0 °C. Next,
the mixture solution was stirred for 48h at room temperature. Subsequently,
DCU was removed by filtration and the collected solution was concentrated
with a rotary evaporator. To the mixture, 0.5 M HCl was added, and
it was extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic layer
was washed sequentially with saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3, saturated NaCl solution, and deionized water, dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4 for 24 h, and filtered to obtain
the product Boc-lys-lys(acy)-Phe-OMe (yield: 83%). Boc-lys-lys(acy)-Phe-OMe
was converted to the final tripeptide with HCl and saturated ethyl
acetate, and then dilute NaOH solution was used to adjust the pH to
8. The solvents were removed by vacuum rotary evaporation at 50 °C,
and the residue was dissolved in anhydrous methanol. Finally, the
methanol solution was dried with a rotary evaporator to gain the crude
product. It was further purified with silica gel column chromatography
(yield: 77%).

Synthesis and
Characterization of Polyurethanes
A series
of anionic polyurethanes were synthesized from l-lysine diisocyanate
(LDI), mPEG, cystine, CYSD, and PCL according to our previous report.45 Briefly, pre-polymerization of LDI and PCL was
carried out in the presence of 0.1% stannous octoate catalyst and
under the protection of nitrogen at 60 °C for 1 h. The resulting
solution was cooled down to room temperature, after which the chain
extender CYSD and tripeptide were added to react at room temperature
for 1 h (for T0C50mE1900, the addition of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) is
needed to react at 80 °C for an extra 2 h). Subsequently, mPEG
as the terminated chain was added and reacted at 90 °C for 6
h. The final products were precipitated by diethyl ether and washed
at least three times, after which the products were dried under vacuum
at 50 °C for 2 days.

The polyurethanes were characterized
by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography
(GPC). 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AV II-400
MHz spectrometer, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as a solvent. FTIR spectroscopy was performed by a
Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer using the KBr tablet method. GPC was
examined on Waters-1515; the mobile phase was N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/50 mM LiBr with a flow rate of
1 mL/min at 40 °C.

Preparation and Characterization of Polyurethane
Micelles
The anionic polyurethane (50 mg) was first dissolved
in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMAc), and then
the resulting polymer solution was added dropwise into 30 mL of deionized
water. Subsequently, the obtained solution was dialyzed by a dialysis
bag (MWCO = 3500 g/mol) in a large amount of deionized water for at
least six cycles. Finally, the solution was passed through a syringe
filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm to obtain the micelles.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern zetasizer Nano ZS) was used
to measure the size, size distribution, and ζ-potential of anionic
micelles at 25 °C with an angle of 90°. A transmission electron
microscope (TEM, Hitachi model H-600-4) was used to observe the morphology
of polyurethane micelles. The micelles were negatively stained by
1% phosphotungstic acid and dropped onto the copper grid, and then
observed at 75 kV.

Stability and Redox Stimuli-Responsiveness
of Polyurethane Micelles
To study the stability of the anionic
micelles, the micelles were
incubated at 37 °C in a shaker under PBS (pH 7.4) with or without
10 mM GSH for 24 h. The change of size was determined at the scheduled
time by DLS.

Drug Loading and Release in Vitro
Paclitaxel (PTX)
was first dissolved in acetone, and the acetone was evaporated by
nitrogen in a glass vial to form a transparent film. The micelles
were added into the vial under ultrasonication for 2 h at room temperature.
The unloaded PTX drug was filtered by a syringe filter with a pore
size of 0.45 μm. The concentration of PTX was calculated by
a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with
a reverse-phase C18 column (Agilent 1260 series). The eluent was a
mixture of acetonitrile and water (60:40 v/v) with 1 mL/min flow rate.
The UV detector was set at 227 nm and the temperature was set at 30
°C.    The PTX release profile was investigated using
the dialysis method as previously described.36 Briefly, the PTX-loaded micelle solution (15 mL) was added to the
dialysis bag. The bag was immersed into 100 mL of PBS (0.01 M) solution
containing 1 M sodium salicylate. The experiment was performed in
an incubator shaker, which was maintained at 37 °C and 100 rpm.
At desired time intervals, 1 mL solution of the media was taken out,
and an equal amount of fresh buffer solution was replenished. The
concentration of PTX in the release media was measured by HPLC.

Cell Culture
The murine fibrosarcoma cell line (L929),
human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), and murine macrophage cell
line (Raw264.7), which were purchased from West China Medical Center
of Sichuan University (Sichuan, China), were cultivated in RPMI 1640
media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
The cells were cultivated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Cellular Uptake in Vitro
Confocal
laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) and flow cytometry microscopy were used to observe the internalization
behavior and intracellular distribution of the anionic micelles. In
brief, Raw264.7 and HeLa cells were plated in a six-well plate with
a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and cultivated in
1640 media containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin. FITC-labeled anionic
micelles were prepared by physical entrapment of the fluorescent probe
FITC. Next, the FITC-labeled micelles with cultured cells were transferred
into wells and incubated for 1 and 3 h (HeLa cells only incubated
for 3 h). Then, each well was washed three times using 0.1 M PBS.
For the CLSM test, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 min and stained with DAPI for 10 min. For flow cytometry, the cells
were collected by trypsin treatment and centrifugation. After removing
the supernatant, 0.1 M PBS (0.5 mL) was used to resuspend the cells.
Finally, the cells were analyzed by Cytomics FC 500 (Beckman Coulter).

Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxicity of anionic micelles
was evaluated using L929 and HeLa cells with proliferation in vitro.
The cells were cultured in a 96-well plate with a density of 5000
cells/well. PTX-loaded or drug-free anionic micelles with different
concentrations were transferred into the wells with cultured cells
and incubated for 24 and 72 h. The cell viability was evaluated using
a CCK-8 assay kit.
