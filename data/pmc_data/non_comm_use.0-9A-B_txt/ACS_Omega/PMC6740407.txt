Size-
and shape-dependent features of plasmonic nanocrystals govern
the development of their applications. In the past decades, gold nanostructures,
such as gold nanorods and nanoshells, have been well studied and applied
for sensing, bioimaging, and photothermal generation. However, knowledge
of copper chalcogenide, a new generation of plasmonic nanomaterials,
is limited, especially about their preparation and size- and shape-dependent
photothermal properties. In this work, controllable size and shape
Cu2–xS nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized
by a facile aqueous route. Using low-molecular-weight polyethylenimine
(PEI) as the reducing and capping agents, the size and shape of Cu2–xS NCs can be controlled with lengths
from 6.5 to 46.5 nm and the aspect ratio from 2.2 to 7.5 by adjusting
the concentration of PEI. The plasmonic peak of Cu2–xS experiences a redshift (from 1145 to 1369 nm) when
the length increases from 6.5 to 44.5 nm. Under the irradiation of
1064 nm laser with 1.33 W/cm2, an excellent photothermal
conversion rate (from 34.9 to 49.0%) is obtained. The characterization
of Cu2–xS NCs is conducted with
a UV–vis spectrometer, transmission electron microscopy, powder
X-ray diffraction measurements, and 1064 nm laser.

Introduction
Over the past two decades,
semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), such
as CdTe,1 CdSe,2 ZnS,3 and PbSe,4 have played important roles in different research fields due to
their unique size- and shape-dependent properties. The energy states
and band gap of these NCs can be tuned by varying the sizes and shapes,
doping with impurities, and growing core–shell structures.
Their optical and electrical properties have been well studied and
extensively applied in biomedical imaging,5 photovoltaic,2 nanophotonic, and sensing
research.6 In recent years, copper-based
chalcogenide NCs are emerging in the research community because of
their capability of heavy doping, resulting in creating hole carriers
in the NCs. In the case of copper sulfide (i.e., Cu2–xS), it is a p-type semiconductor, which has strong
near infrared (NIR) absorption originated from localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR7) of free holes. This newly
discovered plasmonic property in semiconductor NCs has attracted considerable
attention. In particular, the optical and plasmonic properties of
Cu2–xS NCs are highly dependent
on the doping level, crystal structure, size, and shape. For this
reason, comprehensive studies have been conducted on investigating
their nanostructures, synthesizing chemistry, optical responses, and
potential applications. In 2011, Alivisatos et al.8 investigated the influence of size (ranging from 2 to 6
nm) of Cu2–xS NCs on the LSPR absorption.
This work indicated that when the size of Cu2–xS increases, the LSPR absorption peak exhibits a
redshift. In 2015, Mou et al.5 synthesized
ultrasmall (<5 nm) Cu2–xS nanodots
for deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy, and
Kar et al.9 fabricated Cu2–xS nanorod and nanowall arrays in reducing carbon
dioxide into methane under sunlight. These investigations revealed
that the Cu2–xS NCs can be grown
into a variety of morphologies and crystal structures and the potential
of these NCs has not been fully explored.

Finely, controlling
the size and morphology of Cu2–S nanostructures
is of great importance in specific applications.
Various reports have described the methods for synthesizing Cu2–xS nanoparticles and nanorods. Liu
et al.10 synthesized Cu2–xS nanoparticles by injecting sulfur precursors into
Cu–O organic solution at 210–220 °C with strict
oxygen-free environment. To obtain rod-shaped Cu2–xS NCs, Alivisatos et al.11 replaced the Cd element on cadmium sulfide nanorods with the Cu
element through the cation exchange method. Kruszynska et al.12 synthesized copper sulfide nanorods by applying
trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and octadecene (ODE) as surface ligands
with accurate temperature control in reactions. Our group has reported
a nonaqueous millifluidic approach for fabricating a variety of Cu2–xS nanostructures by adjusting the
concentration of precursors and flow rates.13 From the literature, it can be observed that varying the sizes and
shapes of nanoparticles is relatively easy to achieve in organic phase
synthesis.14−16 Inorganic phase synthesis, the use of high temperature
and highly concentrated surfactant solution, and the large variety
of surfactants can passivate specific crystal faces and facilitate
anisotropic growth of nanocrystals, resulting in complex nanostructures.
However, there is only limited number of reports on aqueous phase
synthesis.

One of the reasons that copper chalcogenide nanoparticles
have
drawn lots of attention is their photothermal (PTT) effect.17−19 This light-to-thermal feature, which is associated with the interaction
between electromagnetic radiation and surface excited carriers, has
been applied for cancer therapy within the recent 10 years.20 Due to the noninvasive19 and real-time17 characteristics of PPT,
it is a promising way to cure tumor by generated heat in pathological
sites. The most studied PTT agents for cancer treatment is gold nanostructures21−26 due to their tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak range
from visible to NIR light. Different morphologies of gold nanoparticles
such as nanosphere,22 nanostar,21 nanorod,17,26 and nanocage27 have been studied for photothermal therapy.
Very recently, gold nanoshells from AuroLase have been tested for
pilot clinical trials.23,24 We envision that the future development
of photothermal agents will be on the heat conversion efficiency (HCE)28 (admitted dosage), production cost28 (cost for therapy), and particle size (body
clearance).25 The Cu2–xS nanocrystal, which also has been found to possess
a photothermal effect,29 could be a potential
candidate to replace gold nanostructures as PTT agents. The advantages
of Cu2–xS NCs include (i) easy
fabrication with low cost,28 (ii) small
particle size (normally <10 nm)5,30 and low cytotoxicity,31 (iii) strong NIR absorption located in the “biological
transparent window”,29 and (iv)
capability of generating a photoacoustic signal for bioimaging.32 According to the previous report, copper-based
chalcogenides nanostructures have been investigated corresponding
to different crystallographic compositions, such as Cu1.8S,33 Cu9S5,28 Cu7.2S4,34 and CuS.13 Li et al.34 obtained a high HCE (56.7%) in Cu7.2S4 NCs. However, the NCs were synthesized using a complex
organic synthesis procedure with a strict oxygen-free environment.

In this paper, we propose a facile way to synthesize controllable
size and shape Cu2–xS NCs in an
aqueous solution. A highly available copper(II) chloride and sodium
sulfide were used as the copper source and sulfur source, respectively.
Low-molecular-weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI), which has cationic
properties and low cytotoxicity,35 was
utilized as the reducing and capping agents. The size and morphology
of Cu2–xS NCs can be adjusted with
lengths from 6.5 to 46.5 nm and the aspect ratio from 2.2 to 7.5 by
simply varying the concentrations of PEI. HCE of nanostructures was
also studied, and 34.9 to 49.0% of HCE were obtained accordingly to
Cu2–xS NCs with distinct morphology
under 1064 nm laser irradiation (1.33 W/cm2). Compared
to the reported synthesis methods for Cu2–xS NCs, the method proposed in this article is very simple and
easy to implement. Furthermore, the high HCE obtained in this experiment
makes PEI-capped Cu2–xS NCs as
promising PTT agents.

Results and Discussion
There are
a few protocols for producing copper chalcogenide nanoparticles,28,36 the proposed facile method is among the first attempt to use a single
capping agent for synthesizing elongated (or rod-shaped) Cu2–xS NCs. A series of samples obtained by this method
including nanoparticles and nanorods are shown in Figure 1. The morphology (from dot
to rod) of Cu2–xS NCs can be manipulated
by adjusting the concentration of PEI from 0.032 to 0.160 mg/mL (dots
with ∼7 nm in diameter), 0.224 to 0.750 mg/mL (mixture with
dots and short nanorods), and 1.00 to 1.6 mg/mL (homogeneous nanorods)
in the synthesis procedure. In addition, it is noticed that the aspect
ratio of Cu2–xS nanorods can be
tuned from 2.2 ± 0.3 to 7.5 ± 0.5 by applying different
PEI concentrations. Furthermore, the crystal structures and LSPR spectra
were closely related to the morphology of Cu2–xS NCs. With a shorter dimension of NCs, the crystallographic
phase was dominated by yarrowite (Cu9S8), while
covellite (CuS) was mainly obtained in Cu2–xS nanorods, as shown in Figure 3. The position of the LSPR peak was also affected by
the morphology. With a longer length of nanorods, the LSPR peaks appear
to have a clear redshift from 1231 to 1369 nm, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 1 TEM images of Cu2–xS nanostructures
synthesized with different concentrations of PEI solutions. (a–e)
Under low concentration of PEI, Cu2–xS NCs appear more spherical in shape. (f–i) Under high
concentration of PEI, the morphology of Cu2–xS NCs becomes more anisotropic.

Table 1 summarizes
the design condition and major findings of Cu2–xS NCs of different sizes and shapes (Samples A–I).
These interesting findings cause the motivation to study on their
physical properties. Typically, four samples with distinct features
were chosen as representatives to illustrate the morphology and composition
change with the variation of the amounts of PEI. Under a low concentration
of PEI (0.032 mg/mL), Cu2–xS dots
(Sample A) were formed and appeared in a nearly spherical shape with
an average size of 6.5 nm. TEM images in Figure 2a,e show the size distribution (5–10
nm). With the concentration of PEI increased to 0.224 mg/mL, Cu2–xS nanoparticles are elongated. Short
rod-shaped nanoparticles (Sample D) can be seen in Figure 2b. The differentiation of the
width and length can be seen in Figure 2f. The aspect ratio graph in Figure 2j indicates the mixture of nanoparticles
and short nanorods. With the concentration of PEI further increases
to 1 mg/mL, the morphology of NCs becomes uniform in rod-shaped. In Figure 2c, clear rod-shaped
Cu2–xS NCs (Sample G) with a distinguishable
width (6.5 nm) and length (38.5 nm) are observed. The aspect ratio
also increases from 3.0 to 6.0 compared with samples in Figure 2b. With the PEI concentration
in 1.28 mg/mL, longer Cu2–xS nanorods
(width, 6.5 nm; length, 44.5 nm) (Sample H) are obtained as shown
in Figure 2d. Figure 2l shows that the
aspect ratio increases from 6.0 to 6.5. Figure 2 clearly shows a transition
of the formation from “dot” to “rod” due
to the increase of PEI. A lower concentration (0.032–0.32 mg/mL)
of PEI results in the formation of nanoparticles or the mixture of
nanoparticles and short nanorods, while uniform nanorods can be obtained
with higher PEI concentration (0.75–1.60 mg/mL). The length
of nanostructures can be adjusted from 8 to 46 nm, as shown in Figure 2e–h.

Table 1 Size, Shape, and LSPR Peak of Cu2–xS NCs Obtained from Different Concentrations
of PEI

However, as the concentration of
PEI increases from 1.28 to 1.60
mg/mL, the length of Cu2–xS nanorods
has no significant change. According to the TEM images of the Cu2–xS nanostructure, the width or diameter
of the Cu2–xS nanostructure tends
to be larger with low PEI concentration. One of the reasons is that
the amino group of PEI appears to have strong affinity to particular
crystal orientation at high concentration (e.g., 0.75–1.60
mg/mL). Such mechanism can be considered as an analogy to the use
of oleylamine and dodecylamine for producing semiconductor nanorods
in the organic phase.6,37,38 Similar studies by using citrate acid to synthesize Cu2–xS NCs were conducted. However, no nanorod was found
at any surfactant concentration. It could be attributed to the fact
that PEI is preferentially bind onto (1 1 0) or (1 0 0) faces of Cu2–xS NCs at high concentration. Under
low concentration of PEI, the affinity to (1 1 0) or (1 0 0) faces
is much weaker resulting in the formation of dots or dot/nanorod mixture.
In addition, the actual shape of PEI-capped CuS nanorods is fusiform,
which is quite different with the traditional rod-shaped nanostructure.
It is noted that polymer-like materials are observed in Figure 1f–i. We speculate that
these materials are the remaining surfactant PEI as high concentration
of PEI was used for synthesizing Cu2–xS rods. In contrast, the situation is not obvious in dot-shaped
samples as shown in Figure 1a–d.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images
reveal the lattice plane spacing of each type of nanostructure. In Figure 2m, the lattice plane
spacing of Cu2–xS nanostructures
is 1.98 Å, which corresponds to (0 0 34) crystallographic planes
of hexagonal yarrowite (PDF card number 36-0379). The lattice plane
spacing in Figure 2n is 1.88 Å, which refers to the (1 1 1) plane, one of major
planes in yarrowite. The highly similar diffraction patterns of corresponding
samples in Figure 2q,r indicate that they are dominated by the same crystallographic
phase. According to the HRTEM images of Cu2–xS nanorods, both have ∼1.890 Å lattice plane spacing
value, which correspond to (1 1 0) crystallographic planes of hexagonal
covellite (PDF card number 06-0464). The (0 0 19), (1 0 23), and (1
0 25) planes illustrated by the diffraction pattern in Figure 2s indicate the coexistence
of the hexagonal yarrowite and covellite crystal phase. As the nanorods
are further elongated, the covellite phase is dominant in nanostructures
as illustrated in Figure 2p,t.

According to the XRD patterns in Figure 3, Cu2–xS nanorods (Samples
G and H) were occupied by hexagonal
modifications of covellite and yarrowite, respectively. However, Samples
A and D, which were synthesized at low concentration of PEI, have
a better match XRD pattern with hexagonal yarrowite (Cu9S8, PDF number 36-0379) than covellite (CuS, PDF number
06-0464). Three major peaks of Sample A at 28.65, 31.83, and 47.36°
representing the respective (0 0 22), (1 0 13), and (1 1 1) planes
of yarrowite. Both Samples A and D (in Figure 3) have a similar XRD pattern. By combining
the diffraction pattern in Figure 2q,r, we conclude that both Samples A and D are yarrowite
crystal phases. The XRD patterns of the Cu2–xS nanorod appear to match the covellite crystal phase. The
distinguishable peaks at 27.68, 29.27, 31.78, 47.94, 52.71, and 59.35°
corresponding to (1 0 1), (1 02), (1 0 3), (1 1 0), (1 0 8), and (1
1 6), respectively. In addition, as the XRD signals of Sample H at
29.27, 31.78° has a better match with covellite than Sample G,
indicating that the crystal phase of Cu2–xS NCs is morphology-dependent. It is obvious that the concentration
of PEI alters the crystal structures. The amino of PEI combines with
copper into the coordinate bond and reduces the valence state of copper.

of Samples A, D, G, and H with the reference pattern
of hexagonal yarrowite (PDF number 36-0379) and hexagonal covellite
(PDF number 06-0646).

The absorbance of Cu2–xS nanostructures
with different morphologies is measured by UV–vis–NIR
spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 4. The strong absorption in
the NIR range is originated from the collective oscillation of valence-band
free carriers (holes) on the surface of Cu2–xS NCs, resulting in the LSPR effect. Both Cu9S8 and CuS NCs exhibit strong NIR absorption. Herein, the LSPR
peaks can be tuned from 1148 to 1323 nm with the morphology and composition
change of Cu2–xS NCs. As highly
self-doped semiconductors, the band gap of Cu2–xS can be tuned by the value of x. According to Cheung et al.,13 as the x value increases, Cu2–xS NCs have higher band gap energy resulting in the blueshift of the
LSPR peak. According to Figure 4, CuS dots have an LSPR peak at 940 nm. However, Sample A,
with the same morphology but different composition, has an LSPR peak
at 1148 nm. In addition, for Cu2–xS NCs with the same composition but elongated nanostructures, for
example, Samples G and H, the LSPR peak is nearly 400 nm redshifted
away from CuS dots. As shown in this work, the shape is a more predominant
factor on affecting the LSPR peak. The strong NIR absorption of PEI-capped
Cu2–xS NCs cause the motivation
to investigate the photothermal response of these copper-based chalcogenide
NCs. Pure water and Cu2–xS NCs
were placed in line and irradiated with a 1064 nm laser for 5 min.
The NIR irradiation first penetrated the water sample then passed
through the Cu2–xS NCs. The IR
image in Figure 5a
indicates the temperature change of water and Cu2–xS suspension. The temperature of Cu2–xS NCs was raised from 23 to 43 °C in 5 min even
with attenuated laser. In sharp contrast, the temperature of water
was almost constant (from 23 to 25 °C in 5 min). Detailed photothermal
profiles of different Cu2–xS NCs
were further examined. Cu2–xS NCs
with different morphologies were prepared with the same optical density
(0.5 absorbance in 1064 nm) and then irradiated by 1064 nm laser at
1.33 W/cm2 for 10 min. Distilled water was served as a
negative control. As shown in Figure 5b, a morphology-dependent photothermal response was
observed. Specifically, the temperature of Cu2–xS NC suspension was raised from 23 to 55–65
°C, and Cu2–xS dots possess
the faster elevation.

natural logarithm of driving force temperature. (d) Plot of temperature
change (ΔT) over 10 min vs the aqueous dispersions

densities.

To have a quantitative comparison
of the photothermal response,
the heat conversion efficiency (HCE) was calculated. According to
Roper’s report,39 the HCE, η,
of the synthesized PEI-capped Cu2–xS can be calculated by eq 1 1  where h is
the heat transfer coefficient, S is the surface area
of the container, and the value of hS can be obtained
from Figure 5c. Tmax is the steady-state temperature of Cu2–xS dispersion, while Tsurr is the surrounding temperature. Qdis represents the energy absorbed by the container and
distilled water. I is the power of the laser, while A1064is the absorbance of Cu2–xS NCs at 1064 nm. The optical density of all the
nanocrystal suspension was prepared to 0.5 at 1064 nm and irradiated
by 1064 nm laser (1.33 W/cm2) until a steady-state temperature
was reached. Then, after the laser was shut off, the cooling process
of the aqueous dispersion was recorded for measuring the rate of heat
transfer from NC dispersion to the ambient environment. Consequently,
the obtained HCE of Cu2–xS NCs
are summarized in Table 2.

of Various Cu2–xS Nanostructures

Remarkably, an HCE of 49.0% was obtained from Cu9S8 dots, which is top-ranking among the reported Cu2–xS nanostructures so far. Cu2–xS with elongated morphology has reduced performance
in the photothermal response, which is also illustrated in Figure 5d. The reason for
the variation of HCE obtained in different Cu2–xS structures is still unclear, and further investigation
is needed. In fact, the surfactant has played an important role. For
the Cu2–xS nanorods, the surface
was heavily encapsulated in the PEI polymer matrix, which may affect
the relaxation of phonons and transfer of heat. Another reason could
be the shift of the LSPR peak. Although the samples had the same absorption
at 1064 nm, the portion of scattering and absorption components could
be different.40 Similar to gold nanorods,
with the aspect ratio growth, the scattering component increases,
while the absorption component decreases,41 Cu2–xS nanorods might have a
similar change with growth in the longitudinal direction, resulting
in the difference of HCE. The high HCE value of as-prepared Cu2–xS NCs makes them highly superior
as photothermal agents. Besides, according to the UV–vis–NIR
spectrum of rod-shaped Cu2–xS NCs,
the LSPR peaks are located at 1277 and 1323 nm, which enable this
material for deep tissue biological applications. In addition, to
explore the photothermal stability, Cu2–xS dispersion was irradiated with laser for 10 min followed
by a natural cooling with laser off for three repeated cycles. The
results indicate good stability and reproducibility of Cu2–xS nanostructures in these cycles (Figure S1).

Conclusions
Cu2–xS nanorods, with an aspect
ratio from 2.2 ± 0.3 to 7.5 ± 0.3 and the length from 6.5
to 44.5 nm, have been successfully fabricated using a facile aqueous-based
approach. Low-molecular-weight PEI was used as the capping agent.
The concentration of PEI has played an important role to vary the
shape of NCs. XRD analysis revealed that the dominant crystallographic
phase of Cu2–xS (Cu9S8 and CuS) was also altered with the morphology change.
As observed from the UV–vis–NIR spectra, when the length
of NCs increases, the corresponding LSPR peak exhibits a redshift
from 1145 to 1369 nm. The prepared Cu2–xS NCs exhibit high HCE (from 34.9 to 49.0%) under the irradiation
of 1064 nm laser with 1.33 W/cm2 power density. In addition,
49.0% of HCE is one of the promising results in the current reported
articles.

Experimental Section
Materials
Copper(II) chloride (99%,
Sigma-Aldrich),
sodium sulfide (90+%, ACROS Organics), Poly(ethyleneimine) solution
(Mn ∼1800, Sigma-Aldrich), and
absolute ethanol (≥99.5%, Merck) were used in the synthesis
of the nanoparticles. All chemicals were used as-received without
further purification.

Synthesis of PEI-Capped Cu2–xS NCs
Cu2–xS NCs were
synthesized by employing low-molecular-weight branched PEI as reducing
and capping agents. Copper(II) chloride and sodium sulfide were employed
as the copper source and sulfur source, respectively. The nucleation
and growth processes were proceeded at 85 °C, followed by incubation
in an ice bath. A typical procedure is as follows: PEI solution was
prepared in required concentration, and copper(II) chloride powders
were dissolved in PEI aqueous solution with 1 mmol/L concentration
under stirring. The solution was blue color. Freshly prepared sodium
sulfide solution was then added dropwise until the color turned red-brown.
The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and subsequently incubated in
an 85 °C water bath for another 10 min. The color of solution
changed from red-brown to dark green, indicating the formation of
Cu2–xS NCs. The samples were centrifuged
with acetone and redispersed in deionized water.

Characterization
of Cu2–xS NCs
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of different
Cu2–xS NCs were obtained using
a JEOL JEM-2011 TEM. All TEM samples were prepared by dropping 20
μL of Cu2–xS aqueous dispersion
onto a standard copper TEM grid and dried at room temperature. Powder
X-ray diffraction was measured with a Rigaku SmartLab powder XRD diffractometer
operating with Cu Kα radiation and Bragg–Brentano θ–2θ
geometry. The samples were prepared by dropping Cu2–xS acetone dispersion on the low-background silicon
sample holders at 30 °C for removing the solvent. The UV–vis–NIR
spectra of Cu2–xS samples were
recorded on an Agilent Cary 5000 Scan spectrophotometer. The infrared
thermal image was captured by the FLIR ONE device. The hydrodynamic
size and zeta potential were measured by a Marvin Nano-ZS90.

Evaluation
of Photothermal Performance
The aqueous
dispersion (1 mL) of Cu2–xS NCs
with different optical densities at 1064 nm were irradiated with an
NIR laser (FU1064ADX-F34, 1064 nm, 1.333 W/cm2). The NCs
dispersions were placed in quartz cuvettes with a temperature probe
attached (with an accuracy of 0.1 °C). The temperature changes
of samples were recorded in every 60 s. To investigate the heat transfer
efficiency, the aqueous dispersion was irradiated with a 1064 nm NIR
laser for 10 min, followed by a naturally cooling process to ambient
temperature. Cu2–xS NCs with different
morphologies were measured under the same conditions.
