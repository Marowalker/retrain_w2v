Using density functional theory and
an implicit solvation model,
the relationship between the topology of boron nitride (BN) nanomaterials
and the protonated/deprotonated states of amino acid analogues is
investigated. In the solvated phase, the calculated results show distinct
“physisorbed versus chemisorbed” conditions for the
analogues of arginine (Arg)- and aspartic acid (Asp)-conjugated BN
nanomaterials, including a monolayer (ML) and a small-diameter zigzag
nanotube (NT). Such a distinction does not depend on the functional
groups of amino acids but rather depends on the curvature-induced
interactions associated with the tubular configuration. Arg and Asp
interact with the BNML to form physisorbed complexes irrespective
of the state of the amino acids in the solvated phase. For the NT,
Arg and Asp form chemisorbed complexes, and the distinct nature of
bonds between the donor electron moieties of N(Arg) and
O(Asp) and the boron of the tubular surface is revealed
by the natural bond orbital analysis; stronger s-type bonds for the
deprotonated conjugated complexes and slightly weaker p-type dominated
bonds for the protonated conjugated complexes. The interaction of
neutral Trp with BN nanomaterials results in physisorbed configurations
through π-stacking interactions with the indole ring of the
Trp and BN nanomaterials. The calculated results form the basis for
a theoretical study of more complex protein macromolecules interacting
with nanomaterials under physiological conditions.

1 Introduction
Nanomaterials with different
topologies possess unique and distinct
properties that can be exploited for biologically related applications,
such as biosensing,1 drug delivery,2 and bioimaging.3 Some
of the topologies that have been investigated as substrates for these
applications include nanotubes (NTs),1,4 nanowires,5 nanoparticles,6 nanorods,7 and two-dimensional (2D) sheets.8Boron
nitride NTs9 (BNNTs), one of the emerging
nanomaterials, have a morphology similar to that of the well-established
carbon NTs (CNTs). BNNTs are recognized as viable candidates for conjugation
with biomolecules,10 showing a strong affinity
toward proteins.11 However, experiments
show contrasting results in terms of the toxicity effects of BNNTs.12

To provide a strong foundation for the
biologically related applications
of BN nanomaterials, the nature of the interface has been the focus
of several theoretical investigations. For DNA and RNA nucleotides,
physisorbed configurations were predicted.13 For amino acids interacting with BNNTs, the calculated results show
that arginine (Arg) and aspartic acid (Asp) exhibit relatively strong
bonds with the surface of the BNNTs relative to the case of tryptophan
(Trp).14 A recent theoretical study considering
only the side chains of α-amino acids interacting with a (6,0)
BNNT and a BN monolayer (ML) reported that the nature of the interaction
strongly depends on the side chain of the analogue molecules in the
gas phase.14b Interactions of the neutral
configurations of the basic and acidic amino acids with both the ML
and NT appeared to be weak and associated with the oxygen-containing
side groups (e.g., serine, Asp, glutamic acid, asparagine, and glutamine).
Stronger interactions with the BNNTs are predicted by the presence
of nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., lysine, histidine, and Arg).
The aromatic amino acids (e.g., Trp, tyrosine, and phenylalanine)
weakly interact with the BNNTs. For the case of BNML, dispersive-type
interactions follow the order of aromatic > N-containing groups
>
O-containing groups of amino acid analogues in the gas phase.

As physiological conditions include the presence of water, theoretical
results obtained for the gas phase may not provide a direct correlation
to experimental results. This is due to the occurrence of different
protonated states within the amino acids in the solvated phase. This
is addressed in this study by considering the interaction of the analogues
of Arg, Asp, and Trp with a BNML and a (5,0) zigzag-type BNNT in a
solvated phase. It is important to note that a small-diameter BNNT
was chosen for its large curvature and BNML was chosen for the lack
of curvature, facilitating the end points to examine the role of topology
in defining the interface of the conjugated complexes in the solvated
phase. Armchair and zigzag BNNTs may show different characteristics,
with the latter found to be more reactive, thereby providing an end
point for the investigation.15 The role
of curvature can be expressed in terms of induced strain of the sp2 bonds in defining the nature of the interface for the conjugated
BN nanomaterials. The
smaller zigzag NTs have greater strain as compared to that of the
armchair configurations.16Both
zigzag and armchair NTs converge to the same properties exhibited
by larger NTs;17 for this reason, armchair
NTs were not considered in this study.

The amino acids considered
are Arg and Asp, representing basic
and acidic side-chain functional groups, respectively, and Trp for
its aromatic properties. Asp is a polar amino acid with a side chain
of carboxylic that can be protonated/deprotonated, resulting in a
net neutral/negative charge, and Arg is a polar amino acid with a
side chain of guanidyl that can be protonated/deprotonated, resulting
in a net positive/neutral charge. Under the physiological condition
of pH 7, both the amino acids are charged, with Arg being protonated
and Asp being deprotonated. The equilibrium configurations of the
conjugated complexes were analyzed in terms of binding energy, bond
distances, and Mulliken charges to gain insight into the nature of
the interface under solvated conditions. Specifically, the calculated
results are expected to shed light on the topological and chemical
conditions for “physisorption versus chemisorption”
of amino acids interacting with BN nanomaterials under physiological
conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
To benchmark
the calculated results, we first report the gas-phase
results of Trp-, Arg-, and Asp-conjugated BN nanomaterials. Later,
results of the solvated-phase calculations considering the different
protonated states of Arg and Asp interacting with BN nanomaterials
are presented.

In gas phase, the calculated results are in qualitative
agreement
(Table S1 of the
Supporting Information) with those obtained using the periodic supercell
models.14b,14dThe
effect of the inclusion of dispersive interaction correction term
D2 on the calculated energies (Table S2) was also investigated. For all cases, the D2 term shows its importance
in capturing contributions from dispersive interactions, which are
generally dominant in the conjugated complexes considered.

It
is known that the interaction of Trp with nanomaterials is governed
by long-range dispersive interactions, with a capability of forming
weak ionic bonds in a conjugated system. Calculations at the density
functional theory (DFT) (Perdew, Becke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)) level
of theory find the adsorption energy to be +0.02 eV for Trp-conjugated
BNML. Inclusion of the D2 term yields the value of −0.74 eV
for BNML. This is not the case with Trp-conjugated BNNT, where the
increase in adsorption energy is small after including the D2 term.
The calculated adsorption energies are −0.74 and −0.29
eV for BNML and BNNT, respectively, at the DFT (PBE-D2) level of theory.
The reduced surface area of the BNNT decreases the interaction with
Trp relative to that available for BNML. This is what has also been
seen for the cases of organic molecules interacting with the BN nanomaterials
in the gas phase.13b,14c,18

Inclusion of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) correction
term lowers the adsorption energy while maintaining the hierarchy
of the interaction strength: protonated Asp < deprotonated Arg
< Trp < deprotonated Asp < protonated Arg toward BNML and
Trp < protonated Asp < protonated Arg < deprotonated Arg
< deprotonated Asp toward BNNT (Table S2). The calculations involving the interaction of BNML with amino
acids were performed with the ML frozen; relaxing the ML configuration
only slightly lowered the adsorption energy. The calculated difference
in the adsorption energy of Asp interacting with the frozen and relaxed
MLs was about 0.01 eV at the DFT (PBE-D2) level of theory. The results
for the tubular configurations were obtained by constraint-free optimization
of BNNT interacting with amino acids.

In the solvated phase,
the calculated adsorption energies of Arg,
Asp, and Trp interacting with the BNML and the (5,0) BNNT obtained
at the DFT (PBE-D2) level of theory are listed in Table 1. The calculated nearest-neighbor
distances between the amino acids and BN nanomaterials, Mulliken charge
transfer, and dipole moments associated with the equilibrium configurations
are also given in Table 1. The calculated equilibrium configurations of amino acids interacting
with BNML and BNNT are displayed in Figures 1, 2, and S1.

a Negative ΔQ represents
charge transfer from BNML (BNNT) to molecule. In the
solvated phase, the protonated Arg and deprotonated Asp have charges
of +1 and −1, respectively.

When conjugated with the BNML, the interactions are
dominated by
the long-range dispersive interactions, yielding physisorbed configurations
(Figure 1). This is
affirmed by the noticeable increase in the adsorption energies after
the inclusion of the D2 correction term in calculations; the BNML-conjugated
complexes show an order of magnitude increase in the adsorption energies
relative to that of the BNNT-conjugated complexes (Table S2). In the solvated phase, the protonated or deprotonated
Arg and Asp interacting with BN nanomaterials have similar adsorption
energies (−0.57 to −0.96 eV) and near-neighbor distances
(2.61–2.79 Å). A negligible charge transfer occurs in
BNML complexes, and the charged BNML complexes have a higher dipole
moment relative to that of neutral BNML complexes as expected.

For BNNT, the calculated results show a difference between the
chemisorbed configurations of the protonated and deprotonated complexes
(Figures 2). The protonated
Arg (i.e., Arg(+)) forms a bond between N (amino group) and B (tubular
surface) atoms, with the near-neighbor distance and adsorption energy
of 1.86 Å and −0.85 eV, respectively. Mulliken charge
analysis shows a small charge transfer between Arg(+) and BNNT. The
protonated Asp prefers to interact with the O (carboxyl group) in
the equilibrium configuration, with the near-neighbor distance and
adsorption energy of 1.59 Å and −1.23 eV, respectively;
a larger charge transfer from the BNNT to Asp also accompanies it.
The increased electronegativity of oxygen in Asp yields a stronger
interaction of the protonated Asp with BNNT.

The interaction
energies and distances are summarized in Figure 3. The deprotonated
Arg and Asp interact with the BNNT to form stable complexes, where
Asp and Arg are chemisorbed on the NT surface with a higher adsorption
energy of about −2.1 eV and a smaller near-neighbor distance
of 1.5–1.6 Å. The nearest-neighbor distance of Arg-conjugated
BNNT (i.e., R(BBNNT–N)) is similar
to that of the cubic BN,19 suggesting a
sp3-type bond at the tubular surface. A higher charge transfer
from BN nanomaterials to the deprotonated Arg and Asp suggests the
interaction to be partially ionic in the conjugated complexes. It
should be noted that the deprotonated Arg and Asp exist together only
at a basic pH. The low pKa value (3.86)
of Asp does not facilitate its coexistence with Arg at a neutral pH.

Figure 3 Physisorbed
vs chemisorbed configurations in the solvated phase:
adsorption energy vs near-neighbor distance of amino acid-conjugated
BN complexes.

To ascertain the nature
of bonding in chemisorbed configurations,
natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis is performed for the BNNT complexes.
For deprotonated amino acids, BBNNT atom on the tubular
surface changes its local environment; originally, its characteristic
is a strained sp1.9–2.2 bond. When conjugated, the
B atom accommodates the newly formed bonds with the neighboring NBNNT atoms. The bond characteristics are sp2.83 (sp2.71), sp2.92 (sp3.02), and sp2.86 (sp2.71) for the deprotonated Arg (Asp(−))-conjugated complexes, whereas the bond characteristic of the BBNNT–NAA (OAA) bond is predicted
to be sp3.42 (sp3.66) for the deprotonated Arg
(Asp–)-conjugated complexes. The tubular surface
atoms, therefore, form sp3-like bonds in the deprotonated
complexes. Interestingly, the protonated amino acids show sp2-like characteristics with a larger p-orbital contribution
from BBNNT atom in the conjugated complexes. The BBNNT bonds are predicted to have characteristics of sp2.28 (sp2.56), sp2.41 (sp2.57), and sp2.43 (sp2.63) for Arg(+) (Asp)-conjugated complexes. The bond characteristic of the BBNNT–NAA (OAA) bond is sp7.99 (sp5.06) for the Arg+ (Asp) complexes.

The calculated adsorption energies are in a stark contrast with
the results of a recent DFT (B3LYP-D2) study20 employing a finite cluster model. For the cases of Arg and Asp interacting
with BNML, the reported energy values20 are −172.21 kcal/mol (−7.46 eV) and −156.96
kcal/mol (−6.81 eV), respectively. These values seem inconsistent
as they are significantly higher relative to the PBE-D2 results together
with the results of the periodic supercell model employing the B3LYP-D2
functional form.14b

Considering that
Trp is a nonpolar aromatic amino acid, investigation
of an interaction of Trp with BN nanomaterials in the solvated phase
can quantify the effect of solvated phase with reference to gas-phase
results. In the solvated phase, Trp stabilizes in the physisorbed
configurations with π-stacking interactions with the indole
ring of Trp and BN nanomaterials, as was the case in the gas phase
(Figure S2). The calculated results agree
with recent experimental results, suggesting physisorption of Trp
on BNML.21

In
the solvated phase, the calculated results show that the interaction
strength with BNML follows the order of deprotonated Arg > protonated
Arg(+) > protonated Asp > deprotonated Asp(−). This is
slightly
different for BNNT, with the hierarchy being deprotonated Asp(−)
> deprotonated Arg > protonated Asp > protonated Arg(+).
The interaction
strength in terms of the adsorption energy shows a contrasting behavior
for BNML and BNNT complexes; BNMLs prefer to form physisorbed complexes
irrespective of the charge states of amino acids, and BNNTs prefer
to form chemisorbed complexes via the formation of a covalent bond
dictated by either dominant p-type (e.g., protonated Arg) or s-type
(e.g., deprotonated Asp) electronic states.

We are aware of
the fact that the PCM may not accurately represent
the interaction of amino acids with water molecules. In general, the
presence of H-bond networks between the amino acid-conjugated complexes
in the solvated phase is likely to modify the equilibrium geometries.
This fact was examined for the case of deprotonated Arg interacting
with both the BNML and BNNT using explicit solvation by including
six water molecules. The calculated results shown in Figure 4 reflect the configurations
obtained using the implicit solvation model. The conclusion is that
the topological variation determines the physisorbed versus chemisorbed
state for amino acids interacting with BN nanomaterials. Furthermore,
it is found that water molecules do not dominate the interface between
the amino acids and the BN nanomaterials. Interestingly, both theoretical
and experimental studies revealed the hydrophobic nature of pristine
BNNT.14b,22

and (5,0) BNNT (right)
in the presence of several water molecules (atoms: H (white), B (pink),
C (gray), N (blue), and O (red)).

It should be noted here that capturing of the physics and
chemistry
of the solvation effect by the PCM was demonstrated in a theoretical
study of the zwitterionic forms of glycine and alanine.23 Our recent study of the interaction of DNA with
chalcogenide quantum dots also shows an effective screening of the
electrostatic interaction between QD and DNA by the solvation model.24 Considering that Figure 4 represents the results of limited DFT calculations,
we plan to use the molecular dynamics method to obtain a detailed
atomistic view of the interface of amino acid-conjugated BN nanomaterials
in the solvated phase.

3 Computational Model
The BNML and BNNT configurations were represented by finite cluster
models, as shown in Figure 5. The
BNML (18 Å × 16 Å) was simulated using a B49N49H22 cluster, and the (5,0) BNNT (4 Å
× 20 Å) was simulated using a B50N50H10 cluster. The cluster edge atoms were passivated by
hydrogen atoms to ensure their appropriate coordination in both the
ML and tubular configurations.25 The cluster
model has been successfully used to describe the properties and interactions
that are localized in nature,26 such as
the cases considered in the present study.

nanomaterials: (left) BNML represented by
the (B49N49H22) cluster and (right)
(5,0) BNNT represented by the (B50N50H10) cluster. The cluster edge atoms are passivated with H atoms (atomic
symbols: N (blue), B (pink), and H (white)).

The DFT calculations were carried out using the Gaussian09
program
package.27 The exchange and correlation
functional form was represented by the PBE functional form.28 The 6-31g(d,p) basis set29 was used for the constituent atoms of the amino acids and
BN nanomaterials. Grimme’s D2 semiempirical approximation was
included within DFT via a posteriori term to the total energy of the
system.30 The importance of the inclusion
of the dispersive term has been emphasized in previous calculations
of interfaces consisting of BN nanomaterials.14a−14c,20

Initially, constraint-free
geometry optimizations of the complexes
were performed to determine the preferred orientation and optimum
height of amino acid relative to the surface of nanomaterial with
the exception of BNML, where sheet was frozen to mimic its periodic
nature. This step was then followed by further calculations, including
(i) height scan of the molecule perpendicular to the surface in incremental
steps of 0.1 Å and (ii) surface grid scan in steps of 0.25 Å
at the height obtained in step (i). A representative energy surface
obtained by scanning a 4 Å × 4 Å area with 400 grid
points is shown in Figure S2. These calculations
were performed at each level of theory, including PBE (gas phase),
PBE-D2 (gas phase), and PBE-D2 (solvated). It is worth noting that
a similar procedure has been successfully employed to obtain the equilibrium
configurations of the complexes consisting of organic molecules interacting
with graphene, CNT, and BNNTs.14d,31

To test the reliability
of the cluster model, a comparison is made
with the properties calculated using the periodic supercell model14c (Table S1). For
BNNT, the bond lengths (RBN) along the
tube axis and the zigzag direction are 1.45 and 1.47 Å, respectively;
periodic DFT calculations also showed the same values of RBN.14c For BNML, the calculated RBN is 1.45 Å, which is in agreement with
the previously reported value of 1.45 Å.14c The semi-ionic nature of bonding displayed in the cluster
model is similar to that predicted by the periodic model, with N having
negative charge in the 2D lattice.25 Both
the ML and tubular configurations are predicted to be semiconducting.14c For the ML, the calculated energy gap between
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) is 4.1 eV, which compares well with the previously
reported value of 4.6 eV obtained using DFT (B3LYP).14c The calculated HOMO–LUMO gap in (5,0) BNNT is 1.7
eV at the DFT (PBE) level of theory. BNNTs show band gap properties
similar to those of their analogue CNT for tubes smaller than (15,0)
or (15,15).32In
general, the inner electronic states interact with tubes having smaller
diameter, thereby reducing the band gap, as was calculated for zigzag-type
(n,0) BNNTs.17

The
α-amino acids contain amine (−NH2)
and carboxylic acid (−COOH) groups, which are connected with
the α-C, forming the backbone of amino acids. Each amino acid
is characterized by its side chain attached to the α-C. The
side chains range from one hydrogen atom to an indole group, giving
each a unique functionality. The backbones form polypeptide chains,
which then fold to form a complex protein structure. In a recent calculation,
a methyl group (CH3) is used to represent a termination
of the backbone, mimicking the protein configuration in a computationally
efficient way.14b Amino acid analogues
are then defined as [CH3-R] molecules consisting of the
side chain (R) and the α-C terminated by three H atoms (Figure 6). This approximation
is similar to the one employed previously with the exception that
the α-C atom is also excluded from the configurations.14b,33

Figure 6 Chemical
structures of the amino acids considered. The first column
is the amino acid in its zwitterionic form, followed by the analogues
in different protonated states. In the analogues, the backbone is
replaced by a −CH3 group.

Each amino acid has specific pKa (i.e.,
logarithmic acid dissociation constant) values for the dissociation
of each proton. The pKa of the Asp side
chain is 3.65, indicating that the side chain can be protonated or
deprotonated. The calculated results find small differences between
the protonated and deprotonated structures at the PBE-D2 level of
theory (e.g., RO–C is 1.21 (1.26)
Å and the RC–C is 1.53 (1.59)
Å in the protonated (deprotonated) Asp). This is also the case
with Arg, where RNH2–C is 1.35 (1.40) Å and the RC–N is 1.33 (1.40) Å in the protonated (deprotonated) Arg.

As biological processes occur in a solvated environment, inclusion
of the effect of such environment in a theoretical model is necessary
for accurate calculations. This fact has also been brought out by
calculations on glycine-conjugated BNNT.14a In this study, the implicit solvation was modeled using a PCM.34 This model simulates the solvent by representing
it as a homogenous continuum medium with a dielectric constant of
78.36 (for water). The adsorption energy of amino acids interacting
with the BN nanomaterials is then calculated using the following equation 1  where Ecomplex is the total energy of a bioconjugated complex, Enanomaterial is the total energy of BNML or
BNNT, Emolecule is the total energy of
the amino acids
considered, and EBSSE is the BSSE, which
was calculated using the counterpoise method.35 The BSSE can only be calculated for the gas phase. NBO analysis
was also conducted on the conjugated NT to characterize the nature
of bonding of the chemisorbed states in the conjugated BNNT complexes.36

4 Summary
The interactions
of neutral and charged amino acid analogues with
BN nanomaterials are investigated in a solvated environment using
the implicit solvation model. The calculated results based on DFT
show that the deprotonated states of the polar amino acids facilitate
the formation of chemically bound states between the donor electron
moieties (i.e., O(Asp) and N(Arg)) and the NT
surface of BBNNT. In the absence of curvature for the BNML,
the amino acids form physisorbed complexes, which are governed by
dispersive interactions. The calculated results show that BNNTs would
have the ability to immobilize proteins through strong interactions
with the acidic and basic amino acids and therefore can be used in
health-related applications.
