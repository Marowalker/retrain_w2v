To evaluate the comparative antibacterial
activity of leucine-based
cationic polymers having linear, hyperbranched, and star architectures
containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments against Gram-negative
bacterium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), herein we performed zone of inhibition
study, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) calculation, and bacterial
growth experiment. The highest antibacterial activity in terms of
the MIC value was found in hyperbranched and star architectures because
of the greater extent of cationic and hydrophobic functionality, enhancing
cell wall penetration ability compared to that of the linear polymer.
The absence of the bacterial regrowth stage in the growth curve exhibited
the highest bactericidal capacity of star polymers, when untreated
cells (control) already reached to the stationary phase, whereas the
bacterial regrowth stage with a delayed lag phase was critically observed
for linear and hyperbranched architectures displaying lower bactericidal
efficacy. Coagulation of E. coli cells,
switching of cell morphology from rod to sphere, and lengthening due
to stacking in an antimicrobial polymer-treated environment at the
bacterial regrowth stage in liquid media were visualized critically
by field emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence
microscopy instruments in the presence of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
stain.

==== Body
Introduction
Recently, the emergence
of drug-resistant bacteria has challenged
modern science and medicine, as bacterial infections are increasingly
posing threat to public health.1 The World
Health Organization has recently recognized that certain bacterial
pathogens have attained resistance to most of the commercially available
and clinically used antibiotics.2 According
to the reports of the Center for Disease Control, antibiotic confrontation
after treatment with those antibiotics has been extended to 2 millions
of people in the United States and lack of proper treatment caused
death of 23 000 individuals annually.3 Hence, there is an urgent requirement for the development of new
antibacterial agents to fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
leading to the generation of mechanistically diverse nonantibiotics.4

These nonantibiotic treatments of chronic
wound infections have
led to the application of honey5,6 and silver.7,8 However, these approaches cannot be an universal remedy as silver
may negotiate wound healing and honey can be difficult to handle.
These problems have highlighted the clinical need to develop new approaches.9 One promising alternative approach is to generate
naturally occurring host-defense antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).10,11 These peptides fold into secondary conformations such as α-helix
or β-sheet after binding to bacterial cell membranes, followed
by the penetration of their hydrophobic and cationic side chains into
distinct domains. Although the molecular mechanisms of these peptides
are still a matter of debate, the most convincing mechanism is the
interaction of AMPs with negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces
through electrostatic interaction, followed by insertion into cell
membranes through a hydrophobic group, leading to the disruption of
membrane integrity and ultimately causing cell death.12 Alternatively, interaction with cellular targets such as
enzymes and DNA/RNA after penetration of some peptides through the
cell membrane inhibiting macromolecular synthesis causes cell death.
Thus, the peptides may have complex mechanisms to exhibit their antimicrobial
efficacy.13,14 Greater abundance of negatively charged
lipids in bacterial cell membranes than in mammalian cells and zwitterionic
phospholipids provide a net neutral charge on the surface of mammalian
cells and introduce selectivity of cationic peptides to bind preferentially
to bacteria by electrostatic attraction.2,15

Though
these peptides are promising alternatives of conventional
antibiotic candidates, large-scale commercial production of AMPs is
largely problematic because of their complicated multistep synthesis
and high manufacturing costs and also because they undergo easy proteolytic
degradation.13,16 To address these issues, biocompatible
cationic polymeric materials imitating the properties of AMPs have
been explored as promising replacements of conventional drugs.17,18 Amphiphilic polymethacrylates,19 polynorbornenes,20 and polyamides21 have
been explored as synthetic antimicrobial agents. There have been several
recent reports on synthetic antimicrobial agents utilizing new and
updated approaches. Abd-El-Aziz et al. introduced antimicrobial resistance
challenged with metal-based antimicrobial macromolecules.22 Nguyen et al. established the high antimicrobial
efficacy of carbon monoxide by releasing a polymer against Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is highly efficient at
preventing biofilm formation.23 AMP mimicking
primary amine- and guanidine-containing methacrylamide copolymers
prepared by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer
(RAFT) polymerization was also investigated.24 Another report exploring the antimicrobial graft copolymer gels
based on 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethylphosphorylcholine and 2-hydroxypropyl
methacrylate in wound dressing application has already been investigated.25 Potent and selective antimicrobial activity
of polycarbonates toward Gram-positive bacteria was investigated by
Nimmagadda et al.3

Many investigations
have explicated the role of structural parameters
of these synthetic AMP imitating polymers in controlling antimicrobial
properties. For example, the effects of amphiphilicity,26,27 molecular weight (MW),28 type of cationic
charges,1 and PEGylation29,30 have been explored to control antimicrobial activity. In this regard,
cationic polymer architecture is also expected to play a critical
function to demonstrate antimicrobial efficacy because of the diverse
orientation of cationic charges and the hydrophobic group with differential
structural variation of those polymers, leading to variable bacterial
cell wall penetration ability. To understand the role of the cationic
polymer architecture on antibacterial efficacy and bacterial cell
morphology, herein we investigated leucine-based cationic polymeric
architecture-induced antibacterial activity against Gram-negative
bacterium, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and bacterial cell morphology variation
upon treatment at supra-minimum inhibitory concentration (supra-MIC).
We have chosen a side-chain leucine-containing polymer because our
previous report demonstrated the highest bacterial cell morphology
switching in semisolid media [Luria Bertani (LB) agar plate] compared
to other amino acid-based polymers.31 Herein,
side-chain leucine-based cationic polymers having linear, hyperbranched,
and star architectures were synthesized via RAFT polymerization. The
highest antibacterial efficacy of star polymers was observed via bacterial
growth experiment in different media and MIC determination. Polymeric
architecture-tempted E. coli cell morphology
at regrowth stage was explored by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), Gram staining, and confocal fluorescence microscopy
after 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, whereas
cell coagulation, morphological switching from rod to sphere, and
lengthening of treated cells with a smooth bacterial cell wall were
visualized. On the basis of these observations, the molecular mechanism
of bacterial cell wall perturbation through morphological switching
and cell coagulation is proposed.

Results and Discussion
Polymer
Design and Synthesis
We previously reported
maximum bactericidal efficacy and drastic morphological switching
in semisolid media from a side-chain leucine-based cationic polymer
having a linear architecture compared to other amino acid (alanine
and phenylalanine)-based homopolymers.31 On the basis of this observation, we have prepared a series of leucine-based
cationic polymers with a structural design of linear, hyperbranched,
and star architectures via the RAFT polymerization technique (Scheme 1) to investigate
the effect of polymeric architectures on their antimicrobial activity
and bacterial cell morphology. Results from the synthesis of side-chain
leucine-based homopolymer,
hyperbranched, and star polymers are summarized in Table 1 and discussed in the Supporting Information. Number-average MWs (Mn,GPC) and polydispersity index (D̵) values were determined from the gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
analysis (Table 1 and Figure S2). The linear homopolymer was designated
as LP and hyperbranched polymers were named as HBP1, HBP2, HBP3, and
HBP4 for [Boc-l-leucine methacryloyloxyethyl ester (Boc-Leu-HEMA)]/[S-(4-vinyl)benzyl S′-hydroxyethylthiocarbonate
(VBHT)] = 5, 10, 20, and 25, respectively. For both linear and hyperbranched
architectures, corresponding Mn,GPC values
are much higher compared to the theoretical MWs (Mn,theo), which were calculated based on monomer conversion
(conv.) during the RAFT polymerization.35 Three star polymers generated from the HBP1 core with the ratios
15/1/0.1, 50/1/0.1, and 85/1/0.1 of [methyl methacrylate (MMA)]/[HBP1]/[2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN)] are designated as SP1, SP2, and SP3, respectively. Again,
P(HBP4-star-MMA) and P(HBP4-star-polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA)) prepared
at ratios 15/1/0.1 of [MMA]/[HBP4]/[AIBN] and 15/1/0.1 of [PEGMA]/[HBP4]/[AIBN]
were named as SP4 and SP5, respectively. The compressed character
of the star polymers can explain the much lower values of Mn,GPC for the star polymers than the corresponding Mn,theo values calculated from the monomer conversion
(Table 1).36 Boc-deprotected polymers (vide infra) were represented
as DLP, DHBP1, DHBP2, DHBP3, DHBP4, DSP1, DSP2, DSP3, DSP4, and DSP5,
where D stands for Boc deprotection.

k RB = 1/DB.

Incorporation of Cationic Charges to Leucine-Based Polymer Architectures
Cationic charge is an essential requirement to disrupt negatively
charged cell membrane of bacteria through electrostatic interaction.37 Hence, cationic charge was introduced to all
the synthesized polymers by removing Boc groups from pendent leucine
moieties in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature
to generate polymers with primary ammonium (−NH3+) salts (Scheme 1). Successful Boc deprotection was demonstrated by 1H NMR spectrum, exhibiting the disappearance of Boc proton signals
at around 1.44 ppm (Figures S3–S6). The −NH2 signal was lost in the 1H NMR spectrum because these protons are exchangeable with the surrounding
deuterated solvent (D2O). Cationic nature of these types
of polymers is already established by our group through the measurement
of zeta potential.38,39

After deprotection, DLP,
DHBP3, DHBP4, DSP4, and DSP5 exhibited prompt solubility in aqueous
medium, making these polymers physiologically more important.40 On the contrary, delayed water solubility for
DHBP1, DHBP2, DSP1, DSP2, and DSP3 was observed, which became soluble
after overnight stirring. This can be explained by the greater DB
of DHBP1 and DHBP2 compared to that of other hyperbranched polymers.
The number of hydrophobic VBHT moieties increased with increasing
DB, hence overall hydrophobicity of DHBP1 and DHBP2 was enhanced,
lowering the rate of water solubility.35 Three star polymers prepared from DHBP1 consist of both hydrophobic
components: the DHBP1 core and the MMA arm, introducing overall hydrophobicity
and thus lowering aqueous solubility. The ultimate water solubility
of these polymers could be explained by the enhancement of overall
charge density because of −NH3+ units
of the branched polymers (DHBP1 and DHBP2) with increasing DB.40

Antibacterial Activity against E. coli
To examine the bactericidal efficacy
of leucine-based architecture
variable cationic polymers, a preliminary zone of inhibition experiment
was performed. Sterile agar plates were prepared, followed by inoculation
with E. coli, and sterile filter paper
disks loaded with 5, 10, and 20 μL of each polymer from 10 mg/mL
stock solution were gripped onto the top of the agar layer and incubated
at 37 °C. The results of the disk susceptibility tests are visualized
in Figure 1. The zone
of inhibition was not observed when 5 μL of the polymer was
deposited. However, a clear and localized inhibition zone upon treatment
of a higher volume (10 or 20 μL) of polymer solutions confirmed
strong bacterial growth inhibitory effect as our polymers contain
sufficient cationic and hydrophobic groups essential for exhibiting
bactericidal properties.41 The hyperbranched
architecture bears a greater extent of cationic charges compared to
the linear version, which increases with increasing DB as the charge
density is proportional to DB.42 The isopropyl
group of leucine introduced hydrophobicity for the homopolymer. For
hyperbranched copolymers, additional hydrophobicity was incorporated
by the phenyl groups of VBHT. Another additional hydrophobic poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) block was introduced in DSP1, DSP2, DSP3, and
DSP4. For DSP5, the hydrophilic PEGMA block decreased the overall
hydrophobicity but enhanced the aqueous solubility. The bactericidal
mechanism of cationic hydrophobic polymers is well-established.43 The cationic charge binds to the negatively
charged bacterial cell wall electrostatically, followed by the insertion
of hydrophobic constituents into the bacterial cell membrane, causing
cell death through leakage of the cytoplasm.44 Hence, by increasing the cationic charge and hydrophobicity, the
bactericidal efficacy of synthetic polymers should be enhanced.45 As our architecture variable polymers contain
a different extent of cationic charge and hydrophobicity as discussed
above, they should also exhibit different bactericidal properties,
but the differentiation is very difficult to be observed in the zone
of the inhibition method. The area of the inhibition zone (the circled
portion) was calculated quantitatively and reported in Table 2. The experiment was performed
in duplicate and also with sterilized water exhibiting no inhibition
zone, which established the fact that the zone of inhibition was only
generated by the polymer treatment (Figure S7).

Next, the comparative cationic
polymer architecture-induced bactericidal
properties were visualized by the broth microdilution technique. DLP,
DHBP3, and DSP5 were chosen for the comparative study from the series
of polymers to determine MIC, as prompt water solubility made these
polymers physiologically more important compared to others. MIC against E. coli was calculated by the turbidity-based assay,
the accepted standard assay, which requires a growth medium containing
nutrient proteins and fragments.46 These
components in a medium may interact nonspecifically with the polymers
and interfere with the physicochemical characterization of polymers
in solution. MIC depends on salt concentration and buffer system of
the media,24 hence these factors have to
be tuned before MIC calculation. To establish the relationship between
the polymer architecture and the antibacterial activity, polymers
were tested in an antibacterial assay using LB broth media with phosphate
buffer containing defined salt concentration and MIC values were obtained
as ∼80, 60, and 50 μg/mL or 1.6, 1.4, and 1.2 μM,
respectively, for DLP, DHBP3, and DSP5 (Table 2). Thus, the greater antimicrobial efficacies
of hyperbranched and star polymers than that of the linear architecture
polymer are obtained here, which can be explained by the greater hydrophobicity
and cationic charge density of these polymers than that of the linear
version as discussed in the previous section. The bactericidal properties
of DHBP3 and DSP5 could not be differentiated by MIC values. However,
the MIC range (50–80 μg/mL) for our leucine-based cationic
polymers with variable architecture demonstrated the greater antibacterial
efficacy against E. coli in comparison
to many reported primary amine-based AMP mimics.24,47

Bacterial cells, exposed to AMPs at supra-MIC, that is, the
value
larger than MIC, revealed more prominent information about morphological
variation.48 To obtain major information
about cationic and hydrophobic leucine-based polymer architecture-triggered
bacterial cell (E. coli) morphological
switching, we measured OD600 at supra-MIC values (200,
400, and 600 μg/mL) for DLP, DHBP3, DHBP4, DSP4, and DSP5 (Table 2). Interestingly,
some initial optical density (OD) values were obtained at these concentrations,
and an instant haziness appeared after immediate addition of the above-mentioned
polymers except DSP5. The phenomenon can be explained by measuring
the transition pH of each polymer. After the removal of the Boc group,
side-chain leucine-based linear, hyperbranched, and star polymers
are expected to show pH-responsive behavior because of their ability
of protonation/deprotonation of side-chain primary amine groups.49

Polymers were dissolved in deionized (DI)
water (2 mg/mL), and
their pH-induced phase transition was measured using UV–vis
spectroscopy at 25 °C. The initial pH of the solutions was adjusted
to approximately 2.5, and then the pH of the solution was increased
in intervals of approximately 0.5 pH units (using 0.1 M NaOH solution).
After a certain time, a sudden increase in pH was visualized for all
four polymers by adding only one drop of NaOH. The % transmittance
(% T) was recorded at 500 nm for all the polymer
solutions adjusted to different pH values. Reduction of 50% T of the polymer solutions is reported as the phase transition
pH. For linear polymer (DLP) and hyperbranched hydrophobic copolymer
(DHB3), the transition pH values were obtained as 6.0 and 4.6, respectively
(Figure S8). Lowering of transition pH
of DHB3 in comparison to that of DLP can be explained by the increase
in the number of hydrophobic VBHT units, already explored by our group.38 Hence, the cloudy nature of the media (pH =
7) after polymer addition can be explained by the lowering of transition
pH (<7) of the polymers because of the presence of a hydrophobic
functionality, leading to greater interaction with media particles.
For two star polymers, DSP4 and DSP5, considerable reduction of transmittance
was absent, exhibiting minimum interaction (minimum OD600) with media particles (Figure S8). The
orientation of DSP4 in solution is such that complete reduction of
transmittance was not observed, hence transition pH was not accurately
determined, though minimum transmittance was observed at ∼50%
because of the presence of the hydrophobic PMMA block. For DSP5, the
hydrophilic PEGMA block enhanced the transition pH making it completely
homogeneous at media pH and exhibited minimum interaction (minimum
OD600) with media particles (Table 2). Nevertheless, architecture-induced comparative
antimicrobial properties were investigated at the supra-MIC value
(200 μg/mL).

Antibacterial Assay of Linear Polymers against E. coli
Bacterial growth experiment was
performed initially in LB broth media at 200 μg/mL of DLP. The
OD600 value of the bacterial culture with and without DLP
was recorded at a time interval of 2 h and plotted against time to
obtain the bacterial growth curve (Figure 2A). Initial OD600 of DLP due to
the lowering of transition pH and interaction with media particles
was recorded as 0.420. The bacterial growth curve generally consists
of a lag phase, a log or an exponential phase, a stationary phase,
and a death phase.50 When a microorganism,
such as a bacterial cell, is introduced into the fresh medium, it
requires some time to adjust with the new environment. This phase
is termed as the lag phase,51 in which
cellular metabolism is accelerated, cells are increasing in size,
but the bacteria are not able to replicate, and therefore, there is
no increase in cell mass. In the log phase,52 the microorganisms are in a rapidly growing and dividing state.
There was an increase in metabolic activity and the number of bacterial
cells at an exponential scale. At the stationary phase,53 the number of bacterial cells and hence OD600 became constant as all the nutrients in the growth medium
are used up by the cells for their rapid multiplication. At the death
phase,54 bacterial cell death occurs because
of the depletion of nutrients. Hence, OD600 reached to
a constant value. The elongation of the lag phase, that is, the required
time for the bacterial culture to enter into the logarithm phase after
polymer treatment, was the major investigation as the length of the
lag phase depends directly on the growth condition of the organism.55 The linear polymer extended the lag phase and
exhibited its growth inhibitory properties up to 9 h (Figure 2A). Then, the bacterial cells
started growing under the antimicrobial polymer-treated environment.

the presence and absence of (A) DLP in LB broth media, where initial
OD600 value of DLP is 0.420; (B) DHBP3 in LB media and

of DHBP3 is 0.255 in LB media; (C) DSP4 and DSP5 in LB media, where
initial OD600 values of DSP4 and DSP5 are 0.495 and 0.002,
respectively.

The cells at higher OD600 (at 11, 13, and 15 h) were
collected, and the cell morphology was investigated by Gram staining
(Figure S9) and FESEM experiment (Figure 3) in each of these
fractions with respect to control. Single cells were very difficult
to be observed by the staining method because of their smaller cell
size, but lower population and coagulation of cells in the treated
environment in comparison to the control set were critically visualized.
Individual cell morphology was clearly established by FESEM analysis.
There are several reports exhibiting polymer-treated E. coli cell images exploring the corrugated cell
surface and the debris of polymer-treated cells, which established
the cell wall disruption mechanism.44 Most
of the FESEM images have been taken upon the exposure of antimicrobial
agents at their MIC.16,56 We have performed FESEM of the E. coli cells under the regrowth stage (after their
delayed lag phase) and under the exposure of DLP at the supra-MIC
value to obtain additional and more critical observation about bacterial
cell morphology. Coagulation of treated cells was more prominently
observed than Gram-staining images (Figure 3D). Elongated cells after treatment with
a smooth cell surface were also critically observed with much lower
population compared to the control (Figure 3E,F). A sheetlike structure was also observed
upon treatment (Figure 3E, inset).

Antibacterial Assay of Hyperbranched Polymers
against E. coli
Bacterial
growth was visualized
in both LB broth media and CDM by measuring OD600 values
in the presence and absence of DHBP3 treated at the supra-MIC value
(200 μg/mL) (Figure 2B). The delayed lag phase of the bacterial growth curve up
to 15 h followed by the regrowth of E. coli cells (Figure 2B)
was observed in the LB media, which is greater than that of DLP (9
h) (Figure 2A), and
hence exhibited greater bactericidal efficiency of the hyperbranched
architecture compared to that of the linear analogue. This can be
explained by the increasing cationic charge and hydrophobicity of
the hyperbranched structure compared to that of the linear one.57 The greater number of −NH3+ moieties in the hyperbranched architecture electrostatically
interact with the negatively charged bacterial cell wall, followed
by the insertion of the hydrophobic phenyl group through the bacterial
cell membrane, leading to cell wall disruption and cell death.46 Initial OD600 because of the lowering
of transition pH and interaction with media particles was recorded
as 0.255. Interestingly, the interaction was only visualized in the
LB broth. In CDM, the interaction between the polymer and media was
absent. Compared to the LB broth, the polymer exhibited a greater
bactericidal nature in CDM as lower OD600 established lower
bacterial cell growth at higher time interval (at 19 and 23 h) with
respect to control. The delayed lag phase of the bacterial growth
curve even in the absence of polymer treatment in CDM compared to
the LB broth media established the superiority of LB over CDM for
the growth experiment as in CDM bacteria needed greater time to adjust
with the environment. Nevertheless, the growth experiment in CDM in
addition to generally used LB broth media established a bactericidal
property of the hyperbranched polymer at different media and different
interactive nature of the polymer with media particles.

To obtain
morphological information, cell pellets were collected from LB broth
media at different time intervals to perform Gram staining, crystal
violet staining (Figures 4, S10, and S11), and FESEM experiment
(Figure 4). Individual
cell morphology was difficult to be observed in the Gram-staining
experiment because of the smaller cell size (Figure 4A,B), but crystal violet staining of cells
exhibited some spherical morphology after treatment at different time
intervals (3, 8, 13, and 19 h), whereas clear rodlike morphology of E. coli was retained in the control set during the
growth experiment (Figures 4A–D and S11) (marked by
red spheres). The spherical morphology was mainly observed in the
earlier stage (at 3 and 8 h), that is, below the log phase (up to
15 h) (Figure 4E,F)
(marked by red spheres). Cell stacking was critically observed after
treatment at near (13 h) and above the lag phase that is at the regrowth
stage (19 h) (Figure 4G,H) (marked by red spheres). Because of the promising bactericidal
efficiency, much lesser cell numbers were observed under treated conditions
(Figure 4G).

violet staining: control at (A) 3, (B) 8,

coli cells at (E) 3, (F) 8, (G) 13, and (H) 19 h of

bar (20 μm).

To obtain additional
information about E. coli cell morphology
in the treated environment, cell pellets were collected
below and above the regrowth stage to perform the FESEM experiment
(Figure 5). Cell size
was enhanced, and the stacking of the cells was observed with respect
to control (comparing Figure 5A,E). Cell population diminished significantly because of
the bactericidal nature of the polymer specifically near the junction
of the lag and log phases of the growth curve (at 13 h) compared with
control (Figure 5B,F).
Some sheetlike cell stacking was also significantly visualized in
the lag phase and regrowth phase after treatment (Figure 5H).

Antibacterial Assay of
Star Polymers against E. coli
Bacterial cells were studied in
LB media in the presence of two star polymers, DSP4 and DSP5, at 200
μg/mL with respect to control. Results were compared with the
growth curves obtained during treatment with linear and hyperbranched
polymers. Most effective growth inhibitory effect was demonstrated
by the growth curve obtained during treatment with polymers having
a star architecture (Figure 2C). Bacterial growth was fully diminished, and the exponential
log phase was absent up to 23 h, when bacterial growth without polymer
treatment reached to the stationary phase, and hence, bacterial regrowth
was inhibited. Initial OD600 of DSP4 was recorded as 0.495,
whereas DSP5 exhibited initial OD600 = 0.002. Earlier,
we have observed that hydrophilic PEGMA caused a decrease of the antibacterial
activity of the amino acid-based cationic homopolymer as it could
not affect the surface wettability and solubility.31 However, here the hydrophilic PEGMA unit enhanced the surface
wettability of DSP558 and maximized antimicrobial
efficacy among all polymer series.

Individual cell morphology
was visualized by FESEM by collecting the cell pellets after the treatment
with DSP5 at 15 h incubation during the growth experiment. Rough cell
surface, cell blisters, and longer cells (marked by a red circle in Figure S12B) were observed because of electrostatic
and hydrophobic interaction of the polymer with E.
coli cells (Figure S12).
Cell pellets of earlier time intervals could not be generated by centrifugation
for the SEM experiment because of lower cell population in media caused
by the strongest bactericidal properties of DSP5.

The number
of cells (Nt) at any
given time point (t) was calculated from
the corresponding growth curves (Table S1). Significant differences in Nt values were also cross-checked using one-way analysis of variance,
which is a collection of statistical models employed to analyze the
differences among group means and their associated procedures (such
as “variation” among and between groups), developed
by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. The significance
of decrease in cell population was determined by the test of significance
and the calculated probability (P) value. The significance
level for a given hypothesis test is such a value for which a P-value less than or equal to is considered statistically
significant. Typical values for significance are 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01.
These values correspond to the probability of observing such an extreme
value by chance. On the basis of this fact, we can conclude that decrease
in cell population was not statistically significant during the treatment
with DLP and DHB3 in CDM, but a significant decrease in the cell number
was observed upon treatment of DHB3 in LB media (P ≥ 0.001) and DSP4 (P > 0.1) and DSP5
(P ≥ 0.01) (Table S1).
Hence, the greater antibacterial efficacy of the star architecture
compared to that of the hyperbranched and linear ones is proved statistically.

Proposed Antibacterial Mechanism against E. coli
The mode of action of leucine-based cationic polymers having
different architectures was evaluated by optical microscopy and confocal
fluorescence microscopy using a well-documented live/dead bacterial
assay based on the DAPI fluorescent dye probe. DAPI binds with the
nucleic acid of both live/dead bacteria and stains blue.59 The staining images were exhibited in Figure 6 with a positive
control comprising the lowest antimicrobial DLP-treated and the highest
antimicrobial DSP5-treated E. coli cells
and untreated live bacterial cells as a negative control collected
during the growth experiment in LB media at 11, 13, and 15 h of incubation.
The bacterial cell wall and morphology could not remain intact during
treatment. Some spherical cells appeared, indicating rod to spherical
switching during treatment (Figure 6C,F,G). Cells were stacked to each other and became
longer, especially under the exposure of the linear polymer (Figure 6D,E), already established
by FESEM (Figure 3E,F).
The highest length of the linear polymer-treated cell was explained
by the faster rise of the growth curve compared to other curves obtained
upon treatment of hyperbranched and star polymers; hence, longer bacterial
cells were arrested in the lag phase upon treatment with DLP.60 Coagulations of the treated cells were visualized
in optical microscopy images even without staining (Figure S13, circled red).

and (B) 15 h; after treatment with DLP

after treatment with DSP5 at (F) 11, (G) 13, and (H) 15 h of incubation
after DAPI staining.

The star polymers could form self-assembly35 which can be considered as single-molecular cationic particles.46 The cationic properties of these intramolecular
aggregates enhance their electrostatic binding to anionic lipopolysaccharides
on the E. coli cell surface and lead
to the substitution of the divalent cations, which are the stabilizing
agents of the outer membrane. Hence, permeability of the outer membrane
would increase the promotion of the uptake of the polymers by the
cell surfaces like AMPs.61 The diffusion
of the polymer through the peptidoglycan layer leads to electrostatic
interaction with anionic lipids of inner cytoplasmic membranes, followed
by the insertion of hydrophobic groups, causing membrane disruption62 and leading to lethal leakage of cellular contents.
Hence, strong perturbation of the cell wall integrity would enhance
with increasing cationic and hydrophobic group. During this perturbation
stage, morphological switching and cell stacking leading to a longer
cell were observed. For linear and hyperbranched polymers, the mechanism
is same as discussed above. Different extent of cationic and hydrophobic
groups can explain the discrepancy of antimicrobial action. Thus,
the role of polymer architecture on antibacterial mechanism can be
established in a significant way.

Antibacterial Activity
against Bacillus subtilis
DLP and DSP5 were further used on Gram-positive B.
subtilis bacterium, and their activity was investigated
by the zone of inhibition method. Sterile agar plates were prepared,
followed by inoculation with B. subtilis, and sterile filter paper disks were loaded with 5, 10, and 20 μL
of each polymer from 10 mg/mL stock solution gripped onto the top
of the agar layer and incubated at 37 °C, but no inhibition zone
was observed (Figure S14). Next, the experiment
was performed upon the exposure of 50, 100, and 200 μL of polymer
solution from the same stock and growth was inhibited partially (Figure 7) as some cells are
visible within the inhibition zone, the circled portion (Figure 7), but the number
is much less compared to the other portion of the plate. These phenomena
established lower antibacterial activity of our polymers on B. subtilis compared to that on E.
coli. The cell wall of a Gram-negative bacterium is
more anionic and hydrophilic compared to that of the Gram-positive
one and hence leads to stronger electrostatic interaction between
the anionic cell wall and the cationic polymer, leading to greater
bactericidal efficacy to E. coli.63

Conclusions
In this report, we have presented bactericidal
capacity of cationic
polymers having different architectures by obtaining a localized inhibition
zone. The variable architectures of side-chain leucine-based cationic
polymers are the key determining factors of antimicrobial activity
against Gram-negative bacterium E. coli and treated bacterial cell morphology. Hyperbranched and star polymers
displayed an excellent bactericidal capability compared to the mostly
used linear counterpart, visualized by MIC values and bacterial growth
experiments. The differential antibacterial activity of the hyperbranched
and star polymers was established by obtaining the bacterial growth
curve in liquid media (LB broth or CDM). The complete disappearance
of the bacterial regrowing stage upon treatment of star polymers indicated
the phenomenon, when untreated cells (control) already reached to
the stationary phase, whereas the bacterial regrowth stage with a
delayed lag phase was critically observed for the linear and hyperbranched
architectures exhibiting lower bactericidal efficacy. Bacterial cell
morphology during the growth stage in liquid media at different time
intervals after antibacterial and architecture variable polymer treatment
was visualized by Gram staining, FESEM, and confocal fluorescence
microscopy after DAPI staining, resulting in coagulation of cells,
cell lengthening due to stacking, and some rod to spherical transformation.
Much lower antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-positive B. subtilis was explored by these polymers via the
zone of inhibition method. Hence, this investigation highlights the
potential of cationic polymeric architecture to improve the antimicrobial
activity, followed by the establishment of the antimicrobial mechanism
against E. coli proceeding through
morphological switching involving cell wall perturbation and cell
surface coagulation.

Gram Staining
Gram staining was performed with cells
collected at different time intervals during the growth experiment
with polymers having various architectures and from control set (without
polymers) at the same time gap. Standard published protocol33 for Gram staining was followed, and the slides
were visualized under a light microscope.

FESEM Analysis
Bacterial cell pellets (E. coli) were
collected at different time intervals
during the growth experiment with polymers having various architectures
and from control set (without polymers) at the same time lag. The
cultures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitates
were washed two times with DI water and then with 1% PBS buffer solution
(pH 7.2). One microliter of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS was added for
0.5 μL culture in the next stage. The samples were incubated
at room temperature for 30 min and then overnight at 4 °C. The
pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with
PBS. Dehydrations of the samples were performed in different ethanol
grades (10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100%—each volume 200
μL for 10 min). Samples were incubated in 100% ethanol for 1
h. Finally, FESEM samples were prepared: an aliquot of sample solution
was drop-casted on a cover slip, dried, and coated with gold/palladium
(20:80). The images were obtained using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma instrument.

Fluorescence Microscopy
The E. coli cell pellets collected at different time intervals during the growth
experiment before and after polymer treatment were centrifuged at
6000 rpm for 15 min at 10 °C. Then, samples were resuspended
in 1 mL Milli-Q water, followed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for
15 min. The supernatant was removed, and bacterial cell pellets were
washed three or four times with PBS. Next, the cells were incubated
with DAPI (25 μL in 200 μL Milli-Q water) for 30 min in
the dark. DAPI can stain both live and dead bacterial cells and bind
with nucleic acid selectively.34 Excess
dye was removed by washing three times with Milli-Q water. Then, 20
μL of glycerol and 50 μL of samples were drop-casted on
the glass slide and sealed. The stained cells were visualized by a
