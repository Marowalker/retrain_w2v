Rice
(Oryza sativa L.) is a staple
food for most of the world’s population, as it is eaten by
nearly half of its inhabitants. Phenylpropanoid glycosides derived
from plants have various biomedical effects. The comparison of the
concentrations of the four major phenylpropanoid glycosides in brown
rice, i.e., 6-O-feruloylsucrose (1),
3′,6-di-O-sinapoylsucrose (2),
3′-O-sinapoyl-6-O-feruloylsucrose
(3), and 3′,6-di-O-feruloylsucrose
(4), between a conventional japonica-type cultivar Koshihikari and a high-yielding indica-type cultivar Takanari revealed that they were 57–162% higher
in Koshihikari than in Takanari. To identify quantitative trait loci
(QTLs) for the concentrations of these compounds (1–4), reciprocal chromosome segment substitution lines derived
from a cross between Koshihikari and Takanari were analyzed. We identified
QTLs for the concentrations of compound 1 on chromosome
2 and of compound 2 on chromosome 4 in the reciprocal
genetic background. The concentrations of these compounds were increased
by the Koshihikari alleles and decreased by the Takanari alleles.
Therefore, the favorable alleles of Koshihikari are available to ameliorate
the lower concentrations of compounds 1 and 2 in Takanari. The combinations of QTLs identified in the present
study together with those of other biologically active compounds make
it possible to breed health beneficial cultivars.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Rice (Oryza
sativa L.) is a staple
food eaten by nearly half the world’s inhabitants.1 According to physiological and morphological
differences, rice cultivars are classified into indica and japonica types.2Indica-type cultivars, which exhibit resistance
to high temperatures,3 are adapted to the
tropical regions,1 whereas japonica-type cultivars, which exhibit resistance to low temperatures,3 are adapted to the temperate regions.1 Although most of the rice that is consumed in
the world is produced by indica-type cultivars,4 the majority of the rice produced in Japan is
from japonica-type cultivars.

As brown rice
has bioactive compounds that are beneficial to human
health, such as γ-oryzanol, tocopherols, tocotrienols, phenylpropanoids,
and γ-aminobutyric acid,5−7 eating brown rice has been focused
on by many consumers.8 Phenylpropanoid
glycosides exert several biomedical effects, such as antiviral,9 antibacterial,10 and
antiinflammatory11 activities. Recently,
we have isolated four phenylpropanoid glycosides, i.e., feruloyl and/or
sinapoyl moieties and a sucrose moiety, 6-O-feruloylsucrose
(1), 3′,6-di-O-sinapoylsucrose
(2), 3′-O-sinapoyl-6-O-feruloylsucrose (3), and 3′,6-di-O-feruloylsucrose (4), together with γ-oryzanol
containing a feruloyl moiety and a sterol moiety, from japonica-type cultivars of brown rice.5

The concentrations of γ-oryzanol, α-tocopherol, and
α-tocotrienol are high in japonica-type cultivars
compared to indica-type cultivars.12−14 In contrast,
the concentration of γ-tocotrienol is high in indica-type cultivars relative to japonica-type cultivars.12,15 Recently, a gene involved in the biosynthesis of γ-tocotrienol
showing strong biological activities has been identified.15 However, whether the concentrations of phenylpropanoid
glycosides differ between indica- and japonica-type cultivars remains unknown. Furthermore, quantitative trait
loci (QTLs) for the concentrations of phenylpropanoid glycosides have
yet been identified.

Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs)
carrying a specific
chromosome segment derived from a donor cultivar in the genetic background
of a recurrent cultivar are a powerful tool for the more accurate
identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with even minor effects
compared to primary mapping populations, such as recombinant inbred
lines.16 Recently, Takai et al. have developed
reciprocal CSSLs derived from a cross between a conventional japonica-type cultivar Koshihikari and a high-yielding indica-type cultivar Takanari.17 Moreover, several QTLs related to photosynthesis rate and lodging
resistance were found using the CSSLs.18,19 More recently,
we have identified QTLs for the concentration of γ-oryzanol
using the CSSLs.14

This study aimed
to identify QTLs responsible for the concentrations
of phenylpropanoid glycosides using reciprocal CSSLs derived from
a cross between Takanari and Koshihikari. In future breeding programs,
our findings should help enhance the health benefits of brown rice.

2 Results
2.1 6-O-Feruloylsucrose
(1) Concentrations in Reciprocal CSSLs
We examined
the concentrations of compound 1 in Koshihikari and Takanari
(Figures 1 and 2). Koshihikari exhibited a concentration (22.2 mg/kg)
that was 57% higher than that of Takanari (14.2 mg/kg) (Figure 3). To identify QTLs for the
concentration of this compound (1), we assessed the reciprocal
CSSLs derived from a cross between Takanari and Koshihikari. Among
the 40 lines of the Koshihikari genetic background, the concentrations
varied from 15.9 to 31.6 mg/kg (Figure 3a). SL1206, SL1212, and SL1218 exhibited lower concentrations,
whereas SL1201, SL1202, SL1208, SL1210, SL1213, and SL1235 had higher
concentrations than Koshihikari. Among the 37 lines with the Takanari
genetic background, the concentrations varied from 10.2 to 16.6 mg/kg
(Figure 3b). SL1302,
SL1303, and SL1305 accumulated higher concentrations, whereas SL1324,
SL1327, and SL1330 had lower
concentrations than Takanari. In addition, we confirmed that SL1206
had significantly (P < 0.001) lower concentration
(17.8 ± 1.2 mg/kg) than Koshihikari (24.0 ± 0.3 mg/kg) in
the samples obtained in 2011.

2.2 3′,6-Di-O-Sinapoylsucrose
(2) Concentrations in Reciprocal CSSLs
The examination
of the concentrations of compound 2 in Koshihikari and
Takanari (Figures 1 and 2) revealed that they were 162% higher
in the former (9.6 mg/kg) compared to the latter (3.7 mg/kg) (Figure 4). In the Koshihikari
genetic background, the concentrations varied from 6.0 to 13.9 mg/kg
(Figure 4a). SL1217
was the only line with a lower concentration than Koshihikari. In
the Takanari genetic background, the concentration varied from 0.4
to 6.6 mg/kg (Figure 4b). SL1315 was the only line that accumulated a higher concentration,
whereas SL1327, SL1335, and SL1336 exhibited lower concentrations
than Takanari. In addition, we confirmed that SL1217 had a significantly
(P < 0.05) lower concentration (4.4 ± 0.4
mg/kg) compared to Koshihikari (5.7 ± 0.1 mg/kg) in the sample
obtained in 2011.

genetic background have significantly different concentrations from
their parent cultivars.

2.3 3′-O-Sinapoyl-6-O-Feruloylsucrose (3) Concentrations in Reciprocal
CSSLs
The quantification of the concentrations of compound 3 in Koshihikari and Takanari (Figures 1 and 2) showed that
they were 84% higher in the former (18.0 mg/kg) compared to the latter
(9.8 mg/kg) (Figure 5). In the Koshihikari genetic background, the concentrations varied
from 12.5 to 22.6 mg/kg (Figure 5a). SL1212, SL1215, SL1218, and SL1224 had lower concentrations
than Koshihikari; in contrast, no lines exhibited higher concentrations
than this cultivar. In the Takanari genetic background, the concentrations
varied from 4.4 to 12.4 mg/kg (Figure 5b). SL1324, SL1335, and SL1336 had lower concentrations
compared to Takanari, whereas no lines exhibited higher concentrations
than this cultivar.

2.4 3′,6-Di-O-Feruloylsucrose
Concentrations (4) in Reciprocal CSSLs
We also
examined the concentrations of compound 4 in Koshihikari
and Takanari (Figures 1 and 2). Koshihikari exhibited a concentration
(5.3 mg/kg) that was 116% higher than that of Takanari (2.5 mg/kg)
(Figure 6). However,
in both the Koshihikari and Takanari genetic backgrounds, no lines
exhibited significantly different levels of compound 4 compared to Koshihikari and Takanari, respectively.

2.5 QTL Mapping for the Concentrations
of 6-O-Feruloylsucrose (1), 3′,6-Di-O-Sinapoylsucrose (2), and 3′,6-Di-O-Feruloylsucrose (3)
According to
the differences in the concentrations of compounds 1–3 in the reciprocal CSSLs derived from a cross between Takanari
and Koshihikari, we mapped the QTLs for the concentrations of these
three compounds (1–3). In the Koshihikari
background, 13 QTLs for the compounds 1–3 were identified (Figure 7a). Eight QTLs for the concentration of compound 1 were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. The Takanari
allele decreased this variable for three but increased it for five
of these QTLs. Furthermore, one QTL for the concentration of compound 2 was identified on chromosome 4, and the Takanari allele
decreased this variable. For the concentration of compound 3, four QTLs were identified on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the
Takanari alleles showed negative effects on this variable.

among chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in the Koshihikari
(a) and Takanari (b) genetic backgrounds grown in 2012. a Chromosome numbers are shown above each physical
map. b Marker names are indicated at the

arrows show putative QTLs for the concentrations of 6-O-feruloylsucrose (1), 3′,6-di-O-sinapoylsucrose (2), and 3′-O-sinapoyl-6-O-feruloylsucrose (3),
and the upward and downward arrowheads indicate where a concentration
was increased by the Koshihikari or Takanari allele, respectively.

In the Takanari background, 10 QTLs were identified
for the concentrations
of compounds 1–3 (Figure 7b). Five QTLs for the concentration
of compound 1 were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 7,
8, and 9. The Koshihikari allele increased this variable for two but
decreased it for three of these QTLs. Furthermore, three QTLs for
the concentration of compound 2 were identified on chromosomes
4, 8, and 11. The Koshihikari allele increased this variable for one
but decreased it for two of these QTLs. For compound 3 concentration, two QTLs were identified on chromosomes 7 and 11
and the Koshihikari alleles showed negative effects on this variable.

2.6 Relationships between the Daily Mean Air Temperatures
during Ripening and the Concentrations of 6-O-Feruloylsucrose
(1), 3′,6-Di-O-Sinapoylsucrose
(2), 3′-O-Sinapoyl-6-O-Feruloylsucrose (3), and 3′,6-Di-O-Feruloylsucrose (4)
Correlation
coefficient analyses were conducted to determine the effects of the
daily mean air temperatures during ripening on the concentrations
of compounds 1–4 (Figure 8). No positive or negative
correlations were observed between the temperatures and the concentrations
of compounds 1–4 in the Koshihikari
genetic background and those of compounds 1 and 4 in the Takanari genetic background (Figure 8a–e,h). The temperatures exhibited
positive correlations with the concentrations of compounds 2 (r = 0.394**) and 3 (r = 0.509***) (Figure 8f,g). However, the exclusion of the values obtained for SL1335 and
SL1336 canceled these correlations.

and Takanari (e–h) genetic backgrounds grown in 2012.

3 Discussion
Brown
rice has bioactive compounds, for instance, γ-oryzanol
and phenylpropanoid glycosides.5,7,14 To breed rice cultivars containing abundant bioactive compounds,
first it is necessary to determine the difference in their concentrations
among cultivars (e.g., between indica- and japonica-type cultivars) and identify the corresponding
QTLs using plant materials for genetic analysis. The concentration
of γ-oryzanol is higher in japonica-type cultivars
compared to indica-type cultivars.12−14 In our previous
study, a japonica-type cultivar Koshihikari accumulated
a 37% higher concentration of total γ-oryzanol than an indica-type cultivar Takanari.14 In the present study, we compared the concentrations of compounds 1–4 between Koshihikari and Takanari and
found that they were 57–162% higher in the former than that
in the latter (Figures 3–6). γ-Oryzanol consists of one
phenylpropanoid moiety (i.e., the feruloyl moiety) and one of sterol
moiety, and compounds 1–4 consist
of one or two phenylpropanoid moieties (feruloyl and/or sinapoyl moieties)
and one sucrose moiety, suggesting that Koshihikari might accumulate
higher concentrations of compounds with phenylpropanoid moieties.

To identify the QTLs for the concentrations of compounds 1–4, the concentrations of the reciprocal
CSSLs derived from a cross between Koshihikari and Takanari were analyzed.
We identified QTLs for the concentration of compound 1 at RM6842–RM17836 on chromosome 2 in the reciprocal genetic
backgrounds (Figure 7). These concentrations were enhanced by the Koshihikari allele but
diminished by the Takanari allele. Moreover, we confirmed that SL1206,
which carries the Takanari allele on chromosome 2 in the Koshihikari
genetic background, showed a lower concentration of compound 1 compared to Koshihikari in the samples obtained in 2011.
SL1305, which carries the Koshihikari allele in the Takanari genetic
background, exhibited a concentration of compound 1 that
was 19% higher than Takanari (Figure 3b). In the same region of chromosome 2, a QTL for the
concentration (w/w) of cycloartenyl ferulate, one of the major components
of γ-oryzanol, was identified previously only in the Takanari
genetic background and the concentration was increased by the Koshihikari
allele.14 We also found QTLs for the concentrations
of compound 2 at RM3916–RM5608 on chromosome 4
in the reciprocal genetic backgrounds (Figure 7). These concentrations were increased by
the Koshihikari allele but decreased by the Takanari allele. Furthermore,
we confirmed that SL1217, which carries the Takanari allele on chromosome
4 in the Koshihikari genetic background, showed a lower concentration
of compound 2 than Koshihikari in the samples obtained
in 2011. SL1315, which carries the Koshihikari allele in the Takanari
genetic background, exhibited a concentration of compound 2 that was 63% higher than Takanari (Figure 3b). In the same region of chromosome 4, a
QTL for the concentration of cycloartenyl ferulate (weight/grain)
was identified previously in the reciprocal genetic backgrounds and
the concentration was increased by the Koshihikari allele but decreased
by the Takanari allele.14 Compound 2 inhibits activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase, which catalyzes
the hydrolysis of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, thus exhibiting biologically
beneficial properties.20 In addition, a
QTL (SPIKE/GPS), which regulates the number of spikelets
per panicle, grain weight, and photosynthesis, was isolated in the
same region of chromosome 4.18,21 The number of spikelets
per panicle was increased by the Koshihikari allele but decreased
by the Takanari allele, whereas grain weight was decreased by the
Koshihikari allele but increased by the Takanari allele.17 As suggested in our previous study, the concentration
of compound 2 might be related to the condition of grain
filling.5 Thus, the favorable alleles of
Koshihikari can be used to improve the concentrations of both compound 2 and cycloartenyl ferulate in Takanari; however, it is necessary
to determine whether these compounds are increased because of a pleiotropic
effect by SPIKE/GPS.

In addition to the above-mentioned
QTLs identified in the reciprocal
genetic backgrounds, many QTLs were identified in only one of the
two genetic backgrounds (Figure 7). In our previous study, we identified QTLs for the
concentrations of total γ-oryzanol and 24-methylenecycloartanyl
ferulate, which is one of the major components of γ-oryzanol,
at RM6034–RM3838-1 on chromosome 5 in the reciprocal genetic
backgrounds.14 In the present study, QTLs
for the concentrations of compounds 1 and 3 were identified in this vicinity of chromosome 5 only in the Koshihikari
genetic background and the concentrations of these compounds (1 and 3) were decreased by the Takanari allele
(Figure 7). SL1218
and SL1219 exhibited lower concentrations (weight/weight) of total
γ-oryzanol and 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate than Koshihikari
in a previous study.14 However, SL1218
exhibited concentrations of compounds 1 and 3 that were 31% and 35% lower, respectively, than those of Koshihikari,
whereas SL1219 had similar concentrations of compounds 1 and 3 compared to Koshihikari in the present study
(Figures 3 and 5). This result suggests that QTLs for the concentrations
of compounds 1 and 3 and γ-oryzanol
exist separately on chromosome 5 and that the QTL for the concentrations
of compounds 1 and 3 may undergo epistatic
interactions with other loci.

Koshihikari is the most representative
leading cultivar in Japan
with a planted area of approximately 490 000 ha (i.e., 35%
of the food rice grown in Japan) in 2018. QTLs for the concentrations
of compound 1 were identified at RM3688–RM3515-1
on chromosome 2 and RM7332-3–RM5442 and RM6970–RM7389
on chromosome 3 only in the Koshihikari genetic background (Figure 7). Interestingly,
unlike the QTLs identified at RM6842–RM5897 on chromosome 2,
RM3513 on chromosome 3, and RM1248–RM17836 on chromosome 5,
the concentrations were greatly enhanced by the Takanari allele. SL1208,
SL1210, and SL1213, which carry the Takanari alleles in the Koshihikari
genetic background, exhibited concentrations of compound 1 that were 33–36% higher than those of Koshihikari (Figure 3). Thus, the favorable
alleles of Takanari can be used to increase further the elevated concentration
of compound 1 in Koshihikari.

We previously found
that the concentrations of compounds 2 and 3 were lower in plants that ripened at
low air temperatures than in those that ripened at high air temperatures.5 In all tested reciprocal CSSLs and their parent
cultivars, heading dates were much later in SL1335 and SL1336 than
in other lines and cultivars,17 showing
that SL1335 and SL1336 ripened under low air temperature conditions
(Figure 8f,g). SL1335
and SL1336 had very low concentrations of compounds 2 and 3 compared to other reciprocal CSSLs and their
parent cultivars (Figures 4b, 5b, and 8f,g). Therefore, the lower concentrations of compounds 2 and 3 observed in SL1335 and SL1336 and the QTLs located
on chromosome 11 may be attributed to the lower air temperatures experienced
during ripening. However, the concentrations of compounds 1–4 in the other lines did not vary significantly
according to temperature (Figure 8a–e,h).

In conclusion, the comparison
of the concentrations of compounds 1–4 between Koshihikari and Takanari revealed
that these levels were much higher in Koshihikari than in Takanari.
We identified QTLs for the concentrations of compound 1 on chromosome 2 and compound 2 on chromosome 4 in the
reciprocal CSSLs derived from a cross between Koshihikari and Takanari.
These concentrations were increased by the Koshihikari allele but
decreased by the Takanari allele. We also found that QTLs for compound 1 were identified on chromosomes 2 and 3 only in the Koshihikari
genetic background. Interestingly, the concentrations of this compound
(1) were enhanced by the Takanari allele. The combinations
of QTLs identified in the present study, together with those for the
concentrations of γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol, will allow
the breeding of cultivars that are beneficial to human health.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Plant Materials
This study was conducted
in 2012 in the experimental paddy field of the Institute of Crop Science,
NARO (36°02′ N, 140°04′ E), Tsukubamirai,
Ibaraki, Japan. We used reciprocal CSSLs (40 and 39 lines in the Koshihikari
and Takanari genetic backgrounds, respectively) and their parent cultivars
(Koshihikari and Takanari). Two paddy fields were used and each CSSL
grown in each paddy field was arranged in a randomized complete block
design with three replicates.

Geminated seeds were sown in nursery
boxes in late April. Plant seedlings were transplanted by hand into
the paddy field in mid-May at a density of 22.2 hills/m2 (one seedling per hill) with a spacing of 15 cm between hills and
30 cm between rows. Seven days before transplanting, the field was
applied 6 g N m–2 in the form of controlled-release
fertilizer with the same proportion of LP40, LPS100, and LP140, and
also applied 5.2 g P m–2 and 7.5 g K m–2 in the form of synthetic fertilizer. Eighty percent of the total
N content in LP40 and LP140 is released at a uniform rate up to 40
and 140 days after application, respectively, and that in LPS100 is
released at a sigmoid rate up to 100 days after application at 20–30
°C. After trimming, the area of each plot was 5.7 m2.

At maturity (mid- to late September), plants from 1.8 m2 (40 hills) were harvested and the air-dried plants were threshed.
The rough rice grains were dehusked and used for the determination
of compounds.

Climate conditions and the heading dates of reciprocal
CSSLs, Koshihikari,
and Takanari were as described by Takai et al.17 As SL1320 and SL1323 in the Takanari genetic background
did not head, grains were not obtained for these lines.

To confirm
the results obtained from the plants grown in 2012,
grains of two lines SL1206 and SL1217, which carry the Takanari alleles
on chromosomes 2 and 4, respectively, in the Koshihikari genetic background
and of Koshihikari grown in 2011 were used.

4.2 Determination
of Compounds
Powdered
grains (50 grains) were extracted with aqueous acetone (acetone/H2O, 1:1 (v/v), 20 mL) at 25 °C for 1 day in the dark.
The aqueous acetone extracts were subjected to C18 HPLC
(TSKgel ODS-80Ts, Tosoh, 4.6 × 250 mm2; eluent, CH3CN/H2O/TFA, 5:95:0.05 to 35:65:0.05 (v/v) for 60
min by linear gradient; flow rate, 0.8 mL/min; UV detection at 320
nm) to determine 1 (tR 28.8
min), 2 (tR 44.1 min), 3 (tR 45.2 min), and 4 (tR 46.2 min).5 The identity of peaks 1–4 was confirmed
with previously isolated 6-O-feruloylsucrose (1), 3′,6-di-O-sinapoylsucrose (2), 3′-O-sinapoyl-6-O-feruloylsucrose (3), and 3′,6-di-O-feruloylsucrose (4). The amounts of 1–4 were calculated using standard curves according to peak
areas.

4.3 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were performed using a general linear model in SPSS (version
17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Analysis of variance was used to examine
the response of the concentrations of compounds 1–4 to CSSL. CSSL and replication were considered as a fixed
effect and a random effect, respectively. Significant treatment effects
(P < 0.10) were determined using Dunnett’s
test. To delineate candidate QTL regions, substitution mapping was
conducted by comparing overlapping segments among the CSSLs according
to a previous study.22
