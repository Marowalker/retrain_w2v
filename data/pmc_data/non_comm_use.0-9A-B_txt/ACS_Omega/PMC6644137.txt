Two-dimensional layer-structure
materials are now of great interest
in energy storage devices, owing to their graphene-like structure
and high theoretical capacity. Herein, graphene-like molybdenum disulfide
(MoS2) nanosheets were uniformly grown on carbon fabrics
by using a hydrothermal method. They were evaluated as binder-free
electrodes for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors. As expected,
long cycling life and high capacity/capacitance are achieved. When
used as self-standing electrodes for LIBs, they deliver a high area
capacity of ∼0.5 mAh/cm2 even after 400 cycles and
remarkable rate capability in the charge/discharge potential range
of 1–3 V. In addition, a three-dimensional integrated electrode
of the MoS2 nanosheet exhibits a high capacitance of 103.5
mF/cm2 and long cycling stability up to at least 15 000
cycles at a current density of 3 mA/cm2 for supercapacitors.
The great cycling stability of MoS2 in supercapacitors
is promising in the enhancement of cycling stability through their
integration with other materials as alternatives to graphene in some
special fields.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
energy storage devices have attracted worldwide attention
due to their vital roles as dominant mobile power sources for a range
of applications, such as mobile devices, new-energy vehicles, and
smart devices.1−4 To develop high-performance electrode materials for lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), metal oxide nanostructures
with high specific capacity/capacitance, typically 2–3 times
higher than that of the carbonous materials, have attracted much attention.5−8 However, their poor cycling stability leads to worse electrochemical
performance which cannot satisfy the practical applications. Therefore,
developing electrode materials with long cycle lives is still an urgent
mission.

Since graphene was discovered in 2004, many other two-dimensional
(2D) layer-structure materials have also regained research interest.9−15 So far, among those two-dimensional (2D) layer-structure materials,
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has played a significant role,
which has been extensively studied for many applications such as photodetectors,
water treatments, memorizers, and especially for SCs and LIBs.16−19 However, when evaluating as an electrode material for Li-ion batteries,
due to the large volume change during the charging/discharging cycles,
the conductivity is low and the structure is destroyed, resulting
in faster capacity decay. To resolve this problem, a feasible way
is to composite with other materials which have excellent electronic
conductivity, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.20−23 Another approach is to increase the interlayer distance of MoS2, which will also introduce voids and defects into MoS2 to increase its lithium ion storage capacity. The third way
is to design binder-free electrodes.

Compared to traditional
binder-enriched materials, the self-standing
electrode does not have any additional current collector or binder,
which leads to high-speed electron transport and ion diffusion. Therefore,
the binder-free electrode can effectively enhance the electrochemical
performance of active materials. In recent years, specific mechanical
and electronic properties of three-dimensional (3D) flexible binder-free
energy storage devices have attracted great attention for the next
generation, such as LIBs and SCs.24−27 For instance, the synthesis of
graded 3D ZnCo2O4 nanowire array/carbonless
cloth binder LIB integrated electrode is reported with high reversible
capacity and good cycling performance.28 Cheng et al. also developed an LTO/graphene foam self-standing electrode
with excellent electrochemical properties.29 SCs and LIBs have many common features in improving the electrochemical
properties of active materials despite their different charge storage
mechanisms. The rationally designed binder-free electrodes are among
them. Very recently, the electrodes based on NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays on carbon textiles synthesized by Zhang et
al. exhibited high reversible capacity/capacitance and excellent cycling
ability for LIBs and SCs.30 Oxygen-deficient
Fe2O3 nanorods on carbon fabrics were synthesized
by Lu et al., and high capacitance and excellent cycling stability
are achieved when used as anodes for SCs.31

In previous reports, many kinds of composites based on MoS2 were synthesized to enhance the cycling stability of MoS2. Recently, to get a more excellent anode material for LIBs,
hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets/activated carbon fiber cloth
and three-dimensional hierarchical MoS2 nano-array/carbon
cloth were synthesized and evaluated. However, the galvanostatic charging
and discharging tests were performed at a potential ranging from 5
mV to 3 V and 1 mV to 3 V, respectively, and the cycling performance
is not so good. Moreover, when the charge/discharge voltage was below
1 V, the carbon cloth and active carbon fiber can contribute a great
deal of the capacity to the whole electrode, which results in the
calculated capacity of active materials higher than real.32−34 At the same time, MoS2-based SCs are mainly binder-enriched.
According to previous reports, MoS2 can be widely used
in almost all commonly used electrolytes, because of the relative
stability of MoS2 in acid, neutral, and alkaline aqueous
solutions. When used in alkaline aqueous solution, some researchers
choose Ni foam as the current collector. However, the Ni foam can
easily form NiO on the surface and has a great influence on the measurement
of capacitor properties, which may result in error and exaggerated
capacitance, especially when a little amount of electrode-active materials
are used for the measurements.35−37 To avoid the above problem, carbon
fabrics used as the current collector of the SC electrode may be a
good choice, which can reflect the SC properties of active materials
more accurately.

In this work, graphene-like MoS2 nanosheets on carbon
fabrics are successfully synthesized in a typical and easy hydrothermal
method and directly used as self-standing electrodes for LIBs and
SCs. When evaluated as anodes of LIBs, this kind of integrated electrode
showed high regional capacity, long cycling stability, and excellent
rate performance in a galvanostatic charging and discharging potential
window ranging from 1 to 3 V. When evaluated as electrodes for SCs,
the as-synthesized integrated electrodes exhibited long cycling stability
until 15 000 cycles with a capacitance fading of only 19.4%
in a two-electrode coin cell configuration, when the current density
is 3 mA/cm2.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphologies and Structural Analysis
The graphene-like
MoS2 nanosheets grown in carbon fabrics
were synthesized via an easy hydrothermal method. Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the MoS2 nanosheets. The pattern can be
well indexed to hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS card no. 73-1508).
The peak located at 2θ = 26° is a typical diffraction caused
by carbon fabrics. The other peaks located at 2θ = 14.39, 33.62,
39.65, 44.14, 49.87, and 58.56° can be assigned to the (002),
(101), (103), (006), (105), and (110) planes of the hexagonal MoS2 phase, respectively. Their morphologies were characterized
through the use of field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
and FE-transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM). Figure 1b shows the SEM image of the
as-synthesized products, which were evenly coated high-density samples.
The higher magnification of the SEM image shown in Figure 1d reveals that the samples
on the carbon fabrics are graphene-like ultrathin nanosheet structures.
To clearly observe the thickness of the sample on the carbon fabrics,
the sectional view of the as-synthesized product is shown in Figure 1c. We can clearly
estimate that the thickness of MoS2 nanosheets coated on
carbon fabrics was ca. 200–300 nm. Figure 1e shows the TEM image of the MoS2 nanosheets which were scratched from the carbon fabrics, and we
can clearly see a two-dimensional layer-structure, corresponding to
the SEM images very well (Figure 1d). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and
high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) analyses effectively indicate the polycrystalline
texture of MoS2 nanosheets (Figure 1e,g). The lattice fringes are visible, and
the d-spacing of 0.2635 nm was computed to correspond
well to the (101) lattice plane of the hexagonal MoS2 nanosheet.
The higher magnification image of MoS2 nanosheets is shown
in Figure 1f. We can
observe a well-defined layered structure of MoS2 nanosheets.
The thickness of the MoS2 nanosheet is about 2.5 nm, which
was characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM) in Figure 1h.

pattern. (g) HR-TEM image of MoS2 nanosheets. (h) Three-dimensional
AFM image of MoS2 nanosheets.

The detailed elemental composition and the valence states
on the
surface of MoS2 nanosheets are further characterized by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The investigated spectrum
of the MoS2/carbon fabrics (Figure 2a) shows the existence of Mo, S, C, and O
elements. Figure 2b,c
show the high-resolution XPS spectra of Mo 3d and S 2p obtained from
the MoS2/carbon fabrics. The high-resolution Mo 3d peak
(Figure 2b) shows two
sub-peaks and a small peak at the binding energies of 229.6, 232.8,
and 226.8 eV that correspond to the Mo 3d5/2, Mo 3d3/2, and S 2s states, respectively, indicating that molybdenum
is in its Mo (IV) state. In Figure 2c, the peaks at the binding energies of 163.6 and 162.5
eV correspond to the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 states,
respectively. All of the binding energy values are well consistent
with those reported for MoS2.38

2.2 Li-Ion Battery Performance
Coin-type
cell configuration was used to assess the energy storage properties
of MoS2/carbon fabrics for LIBs. The mass loading of MoS2 nanosheets on carbon fabrics used for LIB tests is about
2.5–3 mg. MoS2 nanosheet/carbon fabric as a cathode
was compared with Li metal under the constant current circulation
conditions under the potential window of 0.01–3 and 1–3
V at the current rate of 0.2 mA/cm2 at room temperature.
When the discharge potential was below 1 V, the carbon fabrics will
react with Li metal, and this process is nearly irreversible. As a
result, the Li metal will be wasted and lead to low Coulombic efficiency.
Furthermore, the reduction peak of MoS2 does not exist
below 1 V. Therefore, we test the electrochemical performance of MoS2/carbon fabrics at a potential ranging from 1 to 3 V. Figure S1 shows the charge/discharge profiles
of MoS2/carbon fabrics and pure carbon fabrics for the
1st, 5th, and 60th, respectively. We can see that the pure carbon
fabrics exhibit high area capacity (Figure S1b). The first-discharge reaction of MoS2/carbon fabrics
comprises mainly two regions. The first potential plateau at ∼1.1
V associated with the reaction of MoS2 and Li+ as in eq 1. The second
plateau at ∼0.6 V is associated with the reduction of Mo4+ into the metallic Mo embedded into a cubic Li2S matrix through the conversion process (eq 2) and the formation of a gel-like solid electrolyte
interphase layer at the interface of the electrolyte and the electrode.
In the charge profiles, the two plateaus at ∼1.7 and ∼2.3
V are associated with the oxidation of cubic Mo to hexagonal MoS2 and dissociation oxidation of Li2S to sulfur,
respectively. In the second and subsequent discharge profiles, two
potential plateaus at ∼1.8 and ∼1.15 V are associated
with reduction of S to Li2S and the formation of lithium
intercalate of LixMoS2, respectively. 1   2  Considering that the main lithiation/delithiation
reaction of MoS2 is above 1 V after the first cathodic
process, and the potential plateau is above 2 V, the capacity contribution
below 1 V cannot be taken into consideration when assembled into full
battery, then, we think that the galvanostatic charge/discharge tests
of MoS2/carbon fabrics performed at a potential ranging
from 1 to 3 V are more suitable.

Figure 3a shows the charge/discharge profiles of
MoS2/carbon fabrics for the 1st, 20th, 100th, 300th, and
400th at the potential between 1 and 3 V, respectively. Because the
reduction process (eq 2) may not occur in the first discharge process, the corresponding
oxidation process may not exist either. The reaction mechanism can
be changed when the potential window changed. According to Figure 3a, during the first
discharge, a large plateau at about 1.25 V can be attributed to the
reaction of MoS2 and Li+ as in eq 1. The reaction of eq 2 does not exist. In the first charge
process, a large inconspicuous plateau between 1.5 and 2.5 V may be
associated with the extraction of Li+ from the LixMoS2 lattice. In the subsequent cycles,
only a simple insertion/extraction process occurs. It should be noted
that the Li+ intercalate potential of the first discharge
process is lower than the subsequent cycles, which can be attributed
to the different discharge depth resulting in the different Li+ insertion potential. Figure 3b shows the cycling performance of MoS2/carbon
fabrics and pure carbon fabrics at a current density of 0.2 mA/cm2 in the potential window between 1 and 3 V. Because the pure
carbon fabrics contribute such little capacity to the whole electrode,
the reaction of Li with carbon fabrics can be neglected. After 400
cycles, the MoS2/carbon fabrics still hold a high reversible
area capacity of 0.4 mAh/cm2, about 80% capacity retention
after the 1st cycle, compared to the cycling performance of MoS2 carbon fabrics tested at a potential window from 0.01 to
3 V (Figure S2), which shows a capacity
retention of only 63% in the 60th cycle after the 1st cycle. The enhanced
cycling performance of MoS2/carbon fabrics when tested
at a potential ranging from 1 to 3 V can be attributed to two reasons.
First, the depth of discharge can result in the easier destruction
of the electrode. Second, the current collector taking part in the
electrochemical reaction may result in the active materials peeling
off from the current collectors and the capacity fading rapidly. To
provide more direct evidence, the morphologies of MoS2/carbon
fabrics tested at a potential ranging from 0.01 to 3 V (a, b, c) and
1 to 3 V (d, e, f) after the cycles were compared. Figure 3c shows the rate performance
of MoS2/carbon fabrics at various current densities from
0.2 to 4 mA/cm2 in a potential window of 1–3 V.
When the current density increases to 4 mA/cm2, the MoS2/carbon fabric electrode still exhibits a high area capacity
of 0.29 mAh/cm2, and when returning back to 0.2 mA/cm2, the capacity of MoS2/carbon fabrics is recovered
with a capacity retention of about 86.7%. The first two charge/discharge
curves of pure carbon fabrics above 1 V are shown in Figure S3. As shown in Figure S3, pure carbon fabrics contribute a low area capacity of less than
0.015 mAh/cm2 between 1 and 3 V. Figure 4a–c show the SEM images of MoS2/carbon fabrics tested at a potential ranging from 0.01 to
3 V after 60 cycles, and it was observed that the structures of the
carbon fabrics and graphene-like nanosheets were completely destroyed.
The materials are partly peeled off from the carbon fabrics. Figure 4d–f show the
SEM images of MoS2/carbon fabrics tested at a potential
ranging from 1 to 3 V after 400 cycles. Compared to the electrode
that is tested at 0.01–3 V, the morphologies of MoS2 were not destroyed completely, and thus we can see the nanosheet
structure clearly.

60 cycles (a–c) and after 400 cycles (e, d, f). The charge/discharge
potential range was 0.01–3 V (a–c) and 1–3 V
(e, d, f), respectively.

2.3 Supercapacitor Performance
The MoS2/carbon fabrics were also applied as self-standing electrodes
of supercapacitors. The mass loading of MoS2 on carbon
fabrics used for SC tests is about 1.8–2.2 mg/cm2. The capacitive properties of the MoS2/carbon fabrics
were first tested with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements in three-electrode configurations. Figure 5a displays the CV curves of the MoS2/carbon fabrics at scan speeds varying from 10 to 50 mV/s. The pseudocapacitance
behavior can be confirmed obviously from the fact that the CV curve
shape is different from the electrical double-layer capacitance, which
is a nearly rectangular CV curve. Notably, redox peaks between −0.8
and 0 V can be seen in all CV curves due to the Faraday effect. As
the scanning rate increases from 10 to 50 mV/s, the peak current rises
up, but the CV curve shape shows no significant change. This result suggests
that rapid redox reactions towards electrochemical energy storage
can be performed with MoS2/carbon fabrics.

Figure 5 (a) CV curves, (b) constant-current
charge–discharge voltage
profiles, (c) specific capacitance as a function of current density,
and (d) cycling performance at a current density of 2 mA/cm2.

Constant current charge/discharge
profiles were conducted at current
densities ranging from 1 to 8 mA/cm2, which are displayed
in Figure 5b. The representative
capacitance of the electrode material is calculated as follows  where I represents the constant-discharge
current, S means the geometrical area of the electrode,
Δt is the discharged time after IR drop, and ΔV is the voltage drop upon discharge.
The specific capacitance of the MoS2/carbon fabric electrode
calculated from each discharge curve is about 191.9, 152.3, 136.7,
127.4, 119.3, and 92.6 mF/cm2 at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 mA/cm2, respectively, as shown in Figure 5c. Figure 5d shows the cycling performance of MoS2/carbon
fabrics at a current density of 2 mA/cm2. After 2000 charge/discharge
cycles, specific capacitance attenuation is negligible, indicating
that the MoS2/carbon fabric electrode has superior cycling
stability performance.

The symmetric two-electrode system adopted
to evaluate the capacitive
performance in this study due to the three-electrode configuration
may easily overestimate the energy storage capability of an electrode
material for practical supercapacitor use. Moreover, the cycling performance
in a three-electrode system can be affected by some other aspects,
such as the active materials peeling off from the current collectors. Figure 6a presents the CV
curves of the two-electrode device at scan rates from 10 to 300 mV/s
with a potential window between −0.8 and 0.8 V. Not only because
of the surface electrosorption of Li+ cations but also
because of the fast, reversible successive surface redox reactions
of MoS2, the measured CV curves show quasirectangular shapes.
It can be seen from the absence of redox peaks that the supercapacitor
is charged and discharged at a pseudoconstant rate throughout the
voltammetric cycle. From the galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements at current densities between 0.5 and 8 mA/cm2, we obtained the accurate electrochemical values of the symmetric
two-electrode system (Figure 6b). The capacitance of the electrode can be calculated according
to the following equation  where I is the constant discharge
current, S is the geometrical area of the electrode,
Δt is the discharged time after IR drop, and ΔV is the voltage drop upon discharge,
respectively.39−41 The area capacitance values of the electrode were
about 159.38, 134.5, 114.5, 103.5, 93.5, 85.63, and 71 mF/cm2 at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 mA/cm2 that are calculated
from the charge/discharge curves, respectively, as shown in Figure 6c. Compared with
the three-electrode configurations, the capacitance of the electrode
is lower in a two-electrode system, which may be a normal phenomenon
in the supercapacitor test. Figure 6d shows the cycling performance of the two-electrode
system at 3 mA/cm2. After 15 000 cycles, the electrode
still retains a high specific capacitance of about 83.7 mF/cm2 (about 80.6% capacitance retention).

3 Conclusions
In summary, graphene-like MoS2 nanosheets have been
successfully grown on carbon fiber fabrics with strong adhesion by
a simple hydrothermal method. The MoS2/carbon fabrics are
self-standing electrodes for energy storage devices. When used as
an anode for Li-ion batteries, graphene-like MoS2/carbon
fabrics give a high reversible area capacity of 0.5 mAh/cm2, long cycling stability (80% capacity retention after 400 cycles),
and excellent rate performance. A high specific capacitance of about
95 mF/cm2 at 3 mA/cm2 and extraordinary cycling
stability (near 81% capacitance retention after 15 000 cycles)
can be achieved as an electrochemical capacitor electrode. Because
of the excellent cycling stability of MoS2, we can composite
with other electrode materials that have large specific capacitance
but poor cycling stability to improve the electrochemical properties
of electrode materials just like graphene and partly replace graphene
in some special aspects.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
Synthesis
Graphene-like
MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by a typical and simple hydrothermal
method. Since all reagents used are analytical without further purification.
To directly grow MoS2 nanosheets on carbon fabrics, commercial
carbon fabrics which are used as substrates were first cleaned with
acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, and then the carbon fabrics
were cut into the needed sizes (2 cm × 4 cm) and immersed in
0.5 M NaOH solution for about 1 h. After the above pretreatment, a
piece of the above carbon fabrics was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel
autoclave (50 mL) containing a mixture of 0.3 g Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.4 g CH4N2S,
and 35 mL deionized water. The sealed autoclave was heated in an oven
at 240 °C for 24 h. Immediately after the completion of the reaction,
the reacted carbon cloth was washed with deionized water and ethanol,
and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h.

4.2 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern was obtained by using an X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert
PRO, PANalytical B.V., the Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectrometry was performed
on a VG Multi-lab 2000 system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray
source. The morphologies and structures of the as-synthesized products
were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI, the Netherlands), a field-emission transmission
electron microscope (Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, the Netherlands), and an
atomic force microscope (AFM, SPM9700, Shimadzu).

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
carbon fabric-supported MoS2 nanosheets directly acted
as the working electrode. Lithium metal was used as the counter electrode,
and a polypropylene film (Celgard-2300) was used as the separator.
The electrolyte used was 1.0 M LiPF6 solution with a mixture
of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC, 1:1 in volume).
Galvanostatic charging and discharging tests were conducted using
a battery testing system (Land, China) at a potential ranging from
1 to 3 V. The SC tests were performed on a CHI 660C electrochemical
workstation in an aqueous LiOH electrolyte (1 M). The three-electrode
cell tests were conducted with Pt foil as the counter electrode and
a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. The two-electrode
SC tests were conducted in a two-electrode coin cell (CR2032) configuration
assembled in air, where MoS2/carbon fabrics serve as both
the cathode and anode, glassy fibers serve as the separator. Coin
cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox for a lithium-ion
battery.
