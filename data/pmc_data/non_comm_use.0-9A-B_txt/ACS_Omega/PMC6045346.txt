Globally,
the need for “on-site” algal-toxin monitoring
has become increasingly urgent due to the amplified demand for fresh-water
and for safe, “toxin-free” shellfish and fish stocks.
Herein, we describe the first reported, Lab-On-A-Disc (LOAD) based-platform
developed to detect microcystin levels in situ, with initial detectability
of saxitoxin and domoic acid also reported. Using recombinant antibody
technology, the LOAD platform combines immunofluorescence with centrifugally
driven microfluidic liquid handling to achieve a next-generation disposable
device capable of multianalyte sampling. A low-complexity “LED-photodiode”
based optical sensing system was tailor-made for the platform, which
allows the fluorescence signal of the toxin-specific reaction to be
quantified. This system can rapidly and accurately detect the presence
of microcystin-LR, domoic acid, and saxitoxin in 30 min, with a minimum
of less than 5 min end-user interaction for maximum reproducibility.
This method provides a robust “point of need” diagnostic
alternative to the current laborious and costly methods used for qualitative
toxin monitoring.

1 Introduction
With
the rapid incline of population growth, the global demand
and pressure for clean water supplies has never been more apparent.
The resultant anthropogenic environmental impacts are predicted to
increase freshwater harmful cyanobacterial and algal bloom prevalence
and duration.1,2 These impacts include both global
warming and water quality degradation, particularly due to eutrophication.
Human, ecological and economic health can all be negatively impacted
by harmful cyanobacterial and algae blooms formed due to eutrophication.3,4

Microcystis aeruginosa is one
of
the most recurrent toxin-producing species of freshwater cyanobacteria
and commonly prevails in fresh and brackish water. One of the most
dangerous toxins produced from harmful algal blooms (HABs) is microcystin-LR
(MC-LR), produced directly by M. aeruginosa, and is shown in Figure 1 left. MC-LR can cause significant health issues for both
humans and animals,5 particularly by inflicting
hepatotoxicity and carcinogenesis through ingestion.6 In the EU, regulatory levels for MC-LR in water is 1 ng/mL
for drinking water and bathing sites, with a >20 ng/mL concentration
eliciting further action.3 One of the most
extreme cases of human exposure transpired in Caruaru, Brazil, in
1996 in a haemodialysis clinic.7 It was
reported that 86% of the 116 patients undergoing dialysis in this
clinic experienced severe MC-LR related symptoms, including liver
failure, resulting in the death of 52 patients.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
MC-LR, DA, and STX in their predominant
congener form.

A second documented marine
toxin is domoic acid (DA), also demonstrated
in Figure 1 center,
which is a highly potent neurotoxin. Naturally manufactured by variant
species of diatom, originating from the genus Pseudonitzschia, it can be responsible for eliciting the amnesic shellfish poisoning
(ASP) illness.8 Following human exposure,
some responses to ASP can include gastrointestinal distress, confusion,
disorientation, seizures, permanent short-term memory loss, and in
the most severe cases death.8,9 The earliest documented
case of ASP contamination was in 1987 on the eastern coast of Prince
Edward Island, Canada, where harvested mussels, contaminated with
DA, were consumed.8−11 This case reported the death of 4 people, with a total of 143 people
presenting similar ASP illness. Following the Canadian ASP event of
1987, and to protect seafood consumers, authorities established an
action limit for DA of 20 μg DA/g shellfish tissue.8 As there is no well-defined action limit for
free DA in drinking water, a method of extraction of DA from shellfish
for detection using antibody technology,12 which involved a 250-fold dilution step, was used to translate the
action limit for free DA to approximately 80 ng/mL in water.

A third highly prevalent marine toxin is saxitoxin (STX), also
illustrated in Figure 1 right, which is another potent neurotoxin. It is most notably responsible
for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) and is produced by the genus Alexandrium spp. Some of the human responses following
exposure to PSP can include gastrointestinal symptoms, numbness/tingling
in mouth, dizziness, headache, fever, ataxia, respiratory distress,
and death.13 Although there is currently
no statutory guideline for STX contamination of drinking water, a
suggested 3 ng/mL informal guideline concentration of for STX is currently
used.14

These relatively low guideline
levels illustrate the importance
of continuous environmental monitoring, and in particular, on-site
algae-toxin monitoring.

Currently, there are several in situ-based
systems with the potential
to monitor toxin presence, and in particular MC-LR, where one such
case was developed by MacKenzie et al. in 2004.15 This approach uses a technique, referred to as solid phase
adsorption toxin tracking, which has since been adapted to allow the
detection and monitoring of toxic algal blooms and shellfish contamination
events.16 This technique, while beneficial,
does require laboratory-based liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
analysis on the previously deployed and recovered materials. This
limits the potential of the analysis system, preventing continuous
autonomous analysis. Another disadvantage of this method is the low
throughput capabilities, as well as the inability of real-time data
capture, due to a weekly based deployment and recovery sampling regime.
These limitations also illustrate the requirement for highly trained
technicians who are capable of handling and characterizing weekly
samples, consequently increasing the associated costs significantly.
These increased costs would also negatively impact the ability of
this approach to perform multiplexed, high density sampling in sites
of interest. Other alternative biosensor-based methods, which have
been used in the detection of MC-LR, have also been limited by this
requirement of laboratory-based analysis. Chianella et al.17 detailed a novel molecularly imprinted polymer-based
piezoelectric sensor for MC-LR with a low detection limit for 0.35
nM (0.35 ng/mL) using in-laboratory analysis. Similarly, electrochemical
biosensors with reported sensitivities of 0.1 μg/L (0.1 ng/mL)
for MC-LR18 and 9.0 × 10–11 M (∼0.09 ng/mL) for a MC-LR specific gene sequence19 again require the use of laboratory-based instrumentation.
A highly sensitive immunosensor for MC-LR has also been demonstrated,20 whereby a graphene–gold nanocomposite/functional
conducting polymer/gold nanoparticle/ionic liquid composite film with
electrodeposition achieved MC-LR detection limits as low as 3.7 ×
10–17 M (∼4 × 10–5 ng/mL). Another immunosensor based-method by presented by Queirós
et al.,21 demonstrates the use of a Fabry–Pérot
interferometer combined with an optical fiber, coated with a sol–gel
imprinted sensing membrane, attained a MC-LR detection sensitivity
of 12.4 ± 0.7 nm L/μg [∼0.08 nm–1·(ng/mL)]. Finally, a cantilever-based immunosensor was also
developed, which could assess MC-LR concentrations as low as 1 pg/mL
(0.001 ng/mL) in varying water sources.22 While these methods achieve highly desirable detection sensitivities,
they all suffer from the common requirement of expensive laboratory
equipment, with specially trained personnel, to perform the analysis.
However, an in situ based method has been previously reported by Long
and colleagues,23 whereby a commercially
available portable trace organic pollutant analyzer was used to detect
MC-LR; however, the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was significantly
higher than any of the laboratory-based methods at 0.03 μg·mL–1 (30 ng/mL), which is above the 1 and 20 ng/mL action
limits for MC-LR in drinking water and bathing sites, respectively.3

To facilitate toxin monitoring at the “site
of interest”,
in situ toxin detection can be alternatively achieved using Lab-On-A-Chip
(LOC) technologies. This can be achieved through precisely controlling
and manipulating of small quantities of liquids contained within a
LOC platform, to process and analyze a sample as if in laboratory
environments, even when in situ. These relatively new technologies
are highly customizable and commercially viable alternatives to the
current detection methods which have been previously employed for
environmental monitoring. LOC-based platforms have been used to specifically
target in situ environmental monitoring, including the detection of
phosphate24−27 and Escherichia coli (E. coli),28,29 with the potential
to also detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, endocrine disruptors
(EDCs), inorganic ions, and heavy metals, by utilizing already developed
microfluidic techniques.30 Whilst LOC platforms
are highly convenient, cost-effective, and highly adaptive, the pumping
technologies often required to drive sample progression through an
LOC cartridge can be expensive. This is primarily due to the high
costs associated with precise pumping mechanisms. A derivative of
the LOC platform, circumventing these externally required expenditures
is the Lab-On-A-Disc (LOAD) platform.31,32

The
LOAD centrifugal microfluidic platform replaces these previously
required pumping mechanisms with a centrifugal driving force, utilizing
a more cost-effective motor system. To date, on-chip water quality
assessment systems have been primarily developed using LOC systems,
with only a few examples reported on centrifugal disc platforms.33,34 There are multiple advantages associated with LOAD platforms, including
automation of system through precisely-timed sample actuation using
centrifugal forces, precise liquid handling, control of samples using
valves, ability to multiplex assays using identical test conditions,
and a myriad of detection techniques compatible on disc, making it
an ideal technique for in situ environmental monitoring.

In
this paper, the first reported multi-analyte LOAD algal toxin
sensor is described. The purpose of this sensor is to advance the
first generation LOAD platform,35 whereby
multitoxin detection of a single, prelysed sample was confirmed using
a fluorescent microscope. The novelty of this system includes the
use of highly specific recombinant antibody (rAb) technology, coupled
with highly sensitive immunoaffinity purified antibodies (Abs) from
chicken, which have far greater sensitivity than their commercial
counterparts. The production of specific DA and STX Abs in chickens
allowed for large quantities of highly sensitive immunoglobulin Y
(IgY) to be purified with relative ease and minimum cost. The LOAD
platform combines immunofluorescence with centrifugally driven microfluidic
liquid handling to achieve a next-generation disposable device for
in situ high-throughput sampling. rAb were selected over alternative
antibody technologies. rAb ensure consistent biosensing detection,
with high purity yielded from production and minimal batch-to-batch
manufacturing variation. A low-cost, “LED-photodiode”
based optical sensing system was tailor-made for the platform. This
optical sensing system allows the fluorescence signal of the toxin-specific
reaction to be quantified. This system can rapidly and accurately
detect the presence of the targeted toxins in approximately 30 min,
with a maximum of 5 min of user-interaction and high reproducibility.
Because of the imminent requirement for a rapid and reliable qualitative
assessment of waterbodies at the point of need, this sensor has the
potential to provide an in situ alternative to the current laborious
and laboratory-based methods used for multiple toxin detection.

2 Results and Discussion
The system design was largely
inspired by the limitations of current
in situ environmental monitoring techniques. The system itself was
specifically designed to prioritize some of these limiting factors,
such as portability, reliability, and ease-of-use, where it is envisaged
that future assembly line manufacturing will offer further reproducibility
and cost-effectiveness improvements. This compact, rapid system was
achieved through small hardware size, simultaneous multi-sample detection
in separate assay form, and reduced assay runtime through minimal
user interaction and incubation periods.

2.1 Microfluidic
Disc Characterization
Reliable fluid manipulation is vital
to conduct accurate assay protocols.
For this reason, the on-disc fluidic dynamics were assessed, with
the results demonstrated in Figure 2 and Supporting Video. The
manual valve approach demonstrated excellent control of liquid, with
minimal premature sample leakage between reservoir transitions. As
this technique indirectly controls sample progression, via direct
pneumatic air actuation, there was no additional cross-reactivity
between the sample and microvalve material. This phenomenon occurs
as the sample, while progressing within a microchannel with a ∼7.5
× 10–8 m2 cross-sectional area,
experiences an increased surface tension force. This increased surface
tension then prevents air-sample pass-through, resulting in an air
compression proportional to the centrifugal force acting on the sample.
Therefore, with the liquid acting as a cap for the succeeding reservoir,
a pressure release through a valve is required to further sample progression.
This pneumatic valving strategy can also be future automated, as described
by Kim et al.36 It is expected that with
the integration of a motor,26,37 sampler,38 and multidisc changer,39−41 long-term autonomous
sensor deployment could be achievable.

Figure 2 Fluid dynamic characterization
of microfluidic disc using a colored-aqueous
solution. The sample was initially loaded into the “load”
reservoir (1). Once the first valve was manually opened while the
disc was stationary, spinning of the disc allows sample progression
only to the succeeding “incubation” reservoir (2), with
minimal premature leakage into the test reservoir (3). The second
valve was opened then for the sample to pass to the test reservoir
(4) and halted (5), with the process repeated until the sample has
passed into the control reservoir (6) and halted for the allocated
time (7), where it was then moved (8) and stored (9) in the waste
chamber.

2.2 Biosensor
Characterization
Because
of the potential human health hazard posed by MC-LR, DA, and STX (which
shall be generically referred to as “toxin”), and the
repercussions associated with a false qualitative screening of waterbodies,
including human health, fishery, recreational, and economic impacts,
a screening method needs to be capable of detecting toxins with a
significant degree of confidence. An assessment of the screening data
variability or coefficients of variation (CV) is critical in determining
the reproducibility of the assay format. Initial experimental design
approaches were investigated to evaluate and determine the optimal
assay parameters for use with the system.

2.2.1 Biosensor
Selection
To attain the
low levels of relevant detection (ng/mL), highly sensitive biosensors
were an essential component in achieving this detectability. All Abs
(recombinant for MC-LR, and polyclonal for STX and DA) were produced
in-house with MC-LR antibody fragments assessed (Figure 3). In the case of DA, it was
also reported that the in-house produced scFv performed better that
the commercial counterparts (sourced by Abcam Ltd.) (Figure 4).

of the microcystin scFv vs scAb antibody
form.

counterparts

2.2.2 Assay Optimization Studies
As the
detection system was limited to an 11-bit ADC reference readout (in
the form of “0-2047” fluorescence response units’
for the end-user), it was important to identify the system’s
maximum fluorescent readability threshold. Therefore, the amount of
fluorescent antibody required for this assay format was investigated
by analyzing varying concentrations of primary antibody to ascertain
the dynamic range of the system. There are several parameters that
primarily influence direct planar assay performance; these include
antibody/antigen concentration, contact time, and flow rate. These
parameters were evaluated for this assay, while a rotational frequency
of 35 Hz constant spin rate was used for the final assay procedure. Figure 5 illustrates the
averaged results (n = 3) of a direct binding assay
performed on the disc to assess optimal antibody concentration and
determined by the system via fluorescence at 430 nm.

Figure 5 Direct binding assay
measured by the system. A set concentration
of MC-LR-BSA coated on the test wells of a disc was probed with varying
concentrations of the Alexa-430-labeled anti-MC-LR scFv. The scFv
were excited fluorescently at 430 nm with the emission signal recorded.
The system readout was limited to “0-2047” response
units (R); therefore, any dilution factor below 1:75 produced a signal
outside of the detectable range.

It was observed that the optimum concentration of anti-MC-LR-Alexa-430
labeled-scFv to be used in the assay for MC-LR detection was approximately
40 μg/mL (1/75 dilution), as observed in Figure 5. This was subsequently calculated to be
approx. 12 and 20 μg/mL for anti-DA-Alexa-430 labeled-scFv and
STX-Alexa-430 labeled-scFv, respectively. These Abs will be generically
referred as “anti-toxin”-Alexa-430 labeled-scFv to avoid
repetition. Once the assay conditions were established and direct
binding of the antibody to the surface of the disc was successfully
quantified, inter/intra assay studies were performed to develop a
calibration curve. Method precision and accuracy for the assay were
evaluated using validation standards in the same complex matrix as
the study samples, that is, lake water samples.

2.2.3 Performance Studies
To assess the
performance of the system with each of the toxins, a number of studies
were conducted to identify the variation between assay readings on
the same disc (intraday) and between separate disc readings on different
days (interday). Six microfluidic discs, with six assay tests per
disc, were manufactured for each toxin. Each of the six assays were
set to be injected with varying toxin concentrates (0, 1, 10, 100,
1000, and 10 000 ng/mL), resulting in triplicate results (over
two separate days) for each concentration. The poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) discs were treated and functionalized at the test zone with
“toxin”-conjugate and the control zone with anti-chicken
antibody. The incubation zone was coated via passive adsorption with
anti-toxin-Alexa-430 labeled-Abs. A silanization approach was also
deemed the most effective in coating the disc surfaces with the detection
molecule of interest, namely, a toxin–BSA conjugate. Issues
arose with the level of background noise observed from the uncoated
discs. The background noise was circumvented by coating the perimeter
of each well with black acrylic paint to negate any inherent optical
interference generated from the PMMA discs.

To determine the
interday variation of results, calibration curves were generated for
each toxin in the range 0–10 000 ng/mL. The CV values
between the interday batches were then calculated via calibration
curve analysis. For the intraday studies; lake water aliquots (1 mL)
were spiked with toxin at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, and
10 000 ng/mL. Sample progression, through each assay step (see Figure 8), was achieved using
the spin cycle approach discussed in microfluidic disc characterization.
The sample progression included pass-through of the incubation chamber,
where the anti-toxin-Alexa-430 labeled-scFv was coated. This was resuspended
by incubation for 5 min with the toxin sample prior to passage over
the test chamber, whereby toxin in the sample and immobilized toxin
on the disc compete for binding to the anti-toxin scFv. Following
resuspension of the Abs at the incubation-zone (see Figure 8), the sample was centrifuged
to propel the sample through the test, control, and waste chambers.

Binding was fluorescently observed in both test and control chambers
separately. Bound scFv was quantified via fluorescence measurement
with a 430 nm excitation light-emitting diode (LED), with the prefiltered
optical range above 475 nm collected, including the emission peak
at 545 nm. Fluorescence measurement occurred after assay completion,
with each single fluorescence value programmed to consist of an averaged
(n = 640, with C sampled every 8
μs) reading generated every ∼0.5 s, with a further averaging
of data captured over a 30 s run. The signal generated from the bound
scFv was found to be inversely proportional to the amount of toxin
present in the test sample. The sample was then passed from the test
chamber to the control chamber where scFv was picked up by the control
anti-chicken antibody. Once signal could be observed in this control
chamber, it was used as a qualitative measure to ensure that the sample
had successfully passed through all zones of the disc, thus signifying
cessation of the assay. The readings generated from assessment of
these lake water-spiked standards formed the calibration curves for
each toxin whereby the system’s performance could be determined.

To determine the detection capabilities of the system, equal volume
lake water samples were spiked with varying concentrations of “toxin”
(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10 000 ng/mL). The spiked lake water
samples were individually applied and run through the prefunctionalized
PMMA disc. The fluorescent response units (R) of the system were then
normalized by dividing the max achievable fluorescence of the blank
(0 ng/mL) response (R0). The intra-assay analysis of each of the toxins,
shown in Figure 6,
was performed in triplicate within the same assay. The observed CV
for this assay was <0.05%, proving considerable quantitative agreement
between the intra-assay standards. A best-fit calibration curve was
applied to the mean data, with assay accuracy determined by comparing
the error of predicted concentrations against known standards. These
results are shown in Table 1.

Figure 6 Intra-assay analysis (n = 3) for MC-LR, DA, and
STX measured on the microfluidic sensor. Spiked concentrations of
“toxin” were incubated with anti-toxin-Alexa-430 labeled-scFv.
The sample was passed to the test zone to interact with coated toxin
conjugate. Signal was observed by fluorescent measurement at the test
zone at 430 nm.

The precision analysis shown in Table 1 demonstrates excellent correlation
<20%
for high concentrations of MC-LR when estimated from the calibration
curve. This is evident by the estimated concentration error recorded,
from use of the calibration curve for validation standards, down to
as low as 100 ng/mL of MC-LR. However, it was noted that while the
overall reported value difference reduced between decreasing MC-LR
levels, the relative percentage deviation to the expected value increased.
This may be due to stearic hindrance effects during the binding event,
when low or noncompeting levels of MC-LR are present, and full capacity
binding of the Abs at the test zone is attempted.42 Ng et al.43 discuss the use
of long flexible linkers such as polyethyleneimine and dextran being
more favorable for covalent attachment than shorter linkers such as
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), as the long flexible linkers
circumvent problems associated with antibody accessibility and steric
limitations, which could be a contributing factor to the low sensitivity
observed within the assay. Taking these hindrance effects into consideration,
and the lower optimum concentration of anti-toxin-Alexa-430 labeled-Ab
used for the DA and STX assays, an increased averaged error correlation
(Table 1) of <26
and <32%, respectively, was not unsurprising.

Quantitative
immunoassays rely on calibration correlations to determine
the analyte concentration in samples from the strength of the signal
produced. Figure 7 illustrates
how the log of analyte concentration is plotted against the percentage
antibody bound. The latter is the signal level expressed as a normalized
function of the total signal response units per response in the presence
of no competitive agent (R/R0). The graphs shown in Figure 6 illustrates the assessment
of toxin detection down to 1 ng/mL in spiked lake water samples. Intraday
CV (n = 3) were calculated as <0.1% for replicates
within the same assay (Figure 6), and the interassay (Figure 7) CV (n = 2) were calculated as <0.27%
for the average calibration curve of MC-LR. These CV values confirm
the reproducibility of the assay. The detection capacity of this assay
as observed from the validated standards is approximately 7.2 ng/mL.

Figure 7 Interassay
analysis for MC-LR, DA, and STX measured on the microfluidic
sensor. Lake water samples spiked with concentrations of DA and STX
were incubated with anti-toxin-Alexa-430 labeled antibody. The sample
was passed to the test zone to interact with coated toxin conjugate.
Signal was observed by fluorescent measurement at the test zone at
430 nm.

The LOD for the system was observed
by using eq 1. The LOD
was calculated to be 7.2 ng/mL for
MC-LR for this assay. This LOD meets the need for an early warning
system capable of providing an early warning assessment of bathing
waterbodies when MC-LR is present, while it is short of the 1 ng/mL
detection limit for drinking water currently. The detection limit
observed from the interday analysis of DA and STX using the detection
system was found to be approximately 20 and 50 ng/mL, respectively.
It was also expected that individual optimizations of the antibody/antigen
concentration, contact time, and flow rate for each of the DA and
STX would have further reduced the LOD. The CV of the DA and STX assay
from the intra-assay studies (Figure 6) were both determined to be less than 0.05%, with
the precision of the assay determined from the interassay studies
(Figure 7) found to
be within 95 and 90% agreement with actual spiked concentrations,
respectively.

Recent detection methods
described for the detection of MC-LR include
biosensor-based methods44−47 or ELISA-based methods48 or even MALDI-TOF49 analysis. These methods
suffer from extensive automation requirements or laborious testing
via specially trained personnel; the methods are also not applicable
for testing in situ at the “point of need”. The qualitative
method described herein illustrates a method for routine use as a
future-autonomous rapid warning system for water quality, with results
in 30 min with minimal end-user interaction. This assay represents
several notable advantages; first, the system is made of inexpensive
materials suitable for mass replication and second, the simple design
offers the potential to become a rapid and easy-to-use instrument
for direct use in the field at the point of need. It has a high within-assay
response-reproducibility and a negligible assay turnaround time. The
limitations of the proposed assay relate to potential deviations induced
to individual discs because of each of the discs currently being manufactured
and assembled by hand, which it is hoped in the future can be produced
using industry standard assembly lines.50 Also, while the biosensor application within the disc is initially
complex, it is hoped that through mass production breakthroughs such
as automated assembly line production, this platform could become
significantly faster and more cost-effective to produce. This proof
of concept system shows detection of low levels of toxins, which makes
it highly applicable for use as a warning system for the qualitative
assessment of recreational or fishing waters. Because of the system
being designed for the detection of “free toxin”, the
addition of a lysing step for extracting toxin from the species for
improving the sensitivity of the system requires would be beneficial
and has been previously demonstrated either on disc32 or through a preloading mechanism.51 The system will be coupled with a wireless communications platform,
motor, and automatic sampler for use as an automated rapid warning,
integrated system. This would include monitoring, analyzing, interpreting,
and distribution monitoring data, in which continuous real-time detection
can be performed for offering generic warning or trigger an alarm
as required, similar to the deployable MARIABOX system.38

3 Conclusion
Intoxication events due to consumption of contaminated seafood
and water supplies due to prevailing marine toxins is becoming a global
problem. Ideally, the monitoring of harmful toxins like MC-LR, DA
and STX should be performed on a device in situ, which is sensitive
enough to perform accurate detection toxin outbreaks in a complex
aquatic matrix. Currently, there is a high priority for the development
of easy-to-use, rapid, robust, and nonexpensive devices for monitoring
of the required low action level concentrations of toxins. Herein,
a rapid system capable of providing an early warning system for the
presence of toxic residues in water samples in situ is described.
This system is capable of detecting algal toxin residues in lake water
matrices using rAb technology and immuno-affinity-purified Abs with
fluorescent-labeling. The advantages of the system are the incorporation
of these elements into a rapid assay for the concurrent detection
of three algal toxins at the point of need. The Abs are produced under
minimum cost conditions and are made in very large quantities. The
instrument provided reproducible dynamic linear ranges and rapid assay
times. The rapid fabrication techniques used in disc generation offered
a platform, whereby tailoring of the prototype’s size, shape,
reservoir volume, and surface structure for rapid assay integration
became feasible. This allowed facilitation of a fully enclosed platform,
specifically optimized for minimal end-user interaction. In addition,
the disposable discs can be mass produced, allowing convenient and
safe “on site” toxin handling, with future possibilities
aimed at fully autonomous system deployment. While these toxin analytes
were used as a “proof of concept” to determine the functionality
of the system, the system is designed generically to allow for future
multiplexing and with testing of numerous toxin variants. This method
could alleviate the costly laboratory procedures associated with frequent
toxin monitoring.

(UK) Ltd. DA polyclonal antibody was obtained from Abcam Ltd. Cambridge,
United Kingdom. Donkey anti-chicken IgY Fab was obtained from Gallus
Immunotech (Antibodies-online GMBH). Lake water samples were obtained
from Leixlip reservoir in Dublin, Ireland, and stored in RNAse and
DNAse free tubes (Fisher Scientific, UK) at 4°. Black acrylic
paint (obtained from Tiger Direct) was also used for biosensor signal
enhancement.

4.2 Preparation of Conjugates
and Fluorescent
Antibodies
MC-LR–BSA conjugates and the recombinant
anti-MC-LR-Alexa-430 were prepared, as per the method by Murphy et
al.52 All animal models used were approved
by the Department of Health and Children, Ireland licensing authority
under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 as amended, for Dublin City
University under license ref no. B100/2705. DA and STX conjugates
were prepared using an Imject EDC KLH spin conjugation kit (Fisher),
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. A Leghorn chicken was
initially immunized subcutaneously with of equal parts solution of
DA-KLH/STX KLH conjugate and Freund’s complete adjuvant. The
final concentration of the initial immunization was 200 μg/mL.
The first boost (day 14) was then administered using 100 μg/mL
of each conjugate in PBS, mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Freund’s
incomplete adjuvant, in a final volume of 1 mL. The final 4 boosts
that followed (days 36, 52, and 66) all contained 100 μg/mL
of each conjugate and were administered in the same manner as the
first boost using an incomplete adjuvant. Serum Abs were isolated
from the chicken and subsequently labeled with Alexa-430.

4.3 Microfluidic Disc Manufacturing
The
microfluidic disc was designed and developed as a single-assay version
of the previously reported multitoxin detection disc.35 The previously reported multitoxin detection disc was fluidically
optimized for sample metering between three separate assays via pneumatic-based
valving with detection performed using a fluorescent-based microscope,
whereas this single assay format, shown in Figure 8, was fabricated primarily to fully characterize a toxin detection
performance on a microfluidic disc platform using an in-house built
fluorescence-based complementary system. The microfluidic disc platform
was manufactured from PMMA sheets and “pressure sensitive adhesive”
(PSA) sheets (ARseal90880), obtained from Radionics and Adhesives
Research, respectively. The discs were manufactured through assembling
consecutive layers of PMMA and PSA.53−55 The roof was additionally
covered using PSA to act as a manual active microfluidic valve layer.
The reservoir floor of the biosensor was laser etched to improve the
binding process (70% power, 60% using Epilog Zing 16, Epilog Laser
USA) with the surrounding reservoir walls painted black, using acrylic
paint, before full disc assembly.

Figure 8 Competitive toxin detection assay protocol
represented by functional
microfluidic reservoirs. (A) Microfluidic assay structure consists
of five reservoirs (loading, incubation, test, control, and waste)
in radial alignment connected by microchannels, each with separate
ventilation systems, and 6 replicates per disc. Each reservoir is
a single step in the competitive assay protocol (B). This inverse
assay demonstrates how a loaded sample, containing prelysed microcystis,
interacts with the reservoir of fluorescent (Alexa 430)-anti-MC-LR
Abs, with the control Abs available for quantification through a separate
capture site to act as a positive control.

4.4 Preparation of Reservoir Surface for Bioactivation
The PMMA layers of the disc were thoroughly surface cleaned in
a class-1000 clean room with the assistance of ultrasonication; A
2% (v/v) solution, consisting of Micro-90 in deionized water was prepared
to remove any present oil, grease, resin, and any biological material
on PMMA layers prior to assembly. This solution was placed in a heat-sealed
bag with all of the PMMA layers and ultrasonicated at 50 °C for
30 min. Subsequently, the PMMA layers were each rinsed three times
with deionized (DI) water, followed by isopropanol. Finally, the PMMA
layers were then rinsed a final time with DI water and dried using
nitrogen. Following this, the PMMA and PSA disc layers were assembled
as two halves [the lower half (LH) and upper half], with a center
point at the floor of the reservoirs, leaving the reservoir floors
exposed on the LH for antibody immobilization treatment. After cleaning
and assembly, the two halves of the discs were then placed in heat-sealed
bags for storage, while the biosensor components were being integrated
to the LH of the disc. Following this integration, the two halves
were then combined to form a single disc.

4.5 Amine
Surface Functionalization of Biosensor
Reservoir Floor by Liquid Phase
Following the cleaning process,
the LH of several discs were then exposed to a microwave-induced O2 plasma, allowing multiple reservoir floor surfaces to be
treated simultaneously, using the plasma cleaner (Harrick plasma,
USA). The O2 gas stream was regulated by the integrated
mass flow controller until the required operating pressure within
the chamber adjusted to approximately 1000 mT. The LH of the discs
was exposed to the O2 plasma for 10 min on the “high
setting”. A 3% APTES solution was prepared in 98% ethanol to
functionalize the PMMA disc reservoirs. This solution was then immediately
applied to the detection reservoirs (reservoir 3 “Test”
and reservoir 4 “Control”) of the surface-activated
discs to provide a binding bridge between the surface oxidation of
the reservoir floor and hydroxylation (−OH groups) of the toxin
conjugates and toxin-specific Abs. The discs were then incubated at
room temperature for 1 h in a fume hood in a 15 cm diameter Petri
dish with cover. Following functionalization, the discs were then
cleaned twice, using a solution of 98% ethanol under ultrasonication
for 15 min. The discs were baked at 60 °C for 2 h in an oven,
where significant cracking of the PMMA discs was noted at high temperatures.
The discs were then allowed to cool to room temperature, at which
point the toxin conjugate/Abs were added to reservoir floor.

4.6 Microfluidic Disc Characterization
The fluidic motion
on the microfluidic discs was assessed using a
customized, in-house developed “spin stand”56 (shown in Figure 9), as previously
demonstrated by Kirby et al.57 Briefly,
the centrifugation of the discs was regulated using a computer-operated
spindle motor (Faulhaber Minimotor SA, Switzerland). A highly sensitive,
short-exposure camera (Pixelfly, PCO, Germany) was combined with a
stroboscopic-programmed light source (Drelloscop 3244, Drello, Germany),
which was synchronized with the spindle motor using in-house built
electronics, for visualizing on-disc fluidic performance under centrifugation.
Furthermore, as the roof was covered using PSA to act as a manual
active microfluidic valve layer, actuation of the microvalves was
attained by pin puncture, allowing pneumatic pressure release which
had prevented sample progression to occur. In summary, the discs were
spun at 35 Hz for 30 s to transport the sample to the subsequent reservoir,
followed by halting of the disc for the required incubation period
per reservoir. After this wait period, the sequential manual microvalve
was opened. This cycle was repeated until the sample had successfully
completed the full assay protocol.

Figure 9 “Spin stand” used for microfluidic
characterization.
This observation setup had a triggering mechanism for actuation of
camera and pulse light every 2πn rotations
(whereby n is a natural number and dependant on rotational
speed). This gives the viewer the perspective of a stationary disc
with fluidic motion, giving precise liquid characterization whilst
simultaneously running assay to be tested in the detection system.

4.7 Optimization
of Antibody Concentration
Preliminary studies were performed
to determine the optimal labeled-antibody
concentration for use in the final assay. An optimal antibody concentration
will provide sufficient signal observation when interacted with the
immobilized toxin conjugate on the surface, and subsequently measured
fluorescently at 430 nm on the system. Varying dilutions of each antibody
from 1/35, 1/75, 1/150, and 1/300 were assessed fluorescently, by
applying 100 μL of each to the inlet channel on a functionalized
disc and spinning the disc on a spin stand at 35 Hz for 1 min. A depletion
sample which included 10 μg/mL of free toxin with 1/75 dilution
of antibody at equal volumes was assessed also. The amount of bound
antibody was determined via fluorescent measurement at 430 nm.

4.8 Toxin Conjugate and Control Antibody Binding
to Biosensor Surfaces
The Alexa-430 labeled specific Abs
were coated on the 2nd radially aligned “incubation zone”
reservoir (see Figure 8) where 100 μL of optimally determined antibody concentration
was added (40 μg/mL). As this reservoir was not functionalized
prior to coating, the antibody was passively adsorbed onto the reservoir
floor of the incubation zone. The sequential release of the sample
was then required for antibody resuspension within the incubation
zone. MC-LR, conjugated to BSA (1 μg/mL), was prepared in a
PBS solution, where 100 μL was then added to each of the 3rd
radially aligned “test” reservoir (see Figure 8). Commercially available anti-chicken
IgY (H + L) (100 μL), at approximately 10 μg/mL (Gallus
Immunotech Inc., Canada), was added to each of the 4th radially aligned
“control” reservoir (see Figure 8). The coated discs were stored at 4 °C
covered for 12 h. To avoid any nonspecific binding from occurring
on the biosensor reservoir floor, the remaining activated amine sites
were then subsequently blocked with 200 μL of 3% BSA (in PBS
solution) added to each reservoir. The blocking agent was left to
incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, after which it was aspirated. Finally,
the disc assembly was completed and the prepared disc was ready for
toxin determination.

The exact same procedure to determine the
calibration curve for DA was followed as was outlined previously for
the MC-LR calibration curve. The variables used for DA include approximately
12 μg/mL of antibody as assessed via ELISA. The conjugate coated
on the test well was 1 μg/mL of DA–BSA conjugate prepared
in-house in DCU. The control antibody used in the control well was
the anti-chicken IgY (H + L) 100 μL, a commercial antibody from
Gallus Immunotech Inc., Canada.

Similarly, the exact same procedure
to determine the calibration
curve for STX was followed as was outlined in section for the MC-LR
calibration curve. The variables used for STX include approximately
20 μg/mL of antibody as assessed via ELISA. The conjugate coated
on the test well was 1 μg/mL of STX–BSA conjugate prepared
in-house in DCU. The control antibody used in the control well was
the anti-chicken IgY (H + L) 100 μL, a commercial antibody from
Gallus Immunotech Inc., Canada.

4.9 Manufacture
of the Detection Platform
The detection system shown in Figure 10 was 3D-printed
from acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene, to hold the disc, with an incorporated fluorescent detection
apparatus to separately capture fluorescence values at both reservoirs
three and four on the disc (Figure 8). The detection system utilized a top-down detection
configuration with a 405 nm excitation LED (cat no. 713-4898, Radionics
Ltd Ireland), a 475 nm long pass filter (cat no. 64-617, Edmund Optics
Ltd.), and a photo-LED emission detector sensitive from 420–675
nm (cat no. 708-2813, Radionics Ltd., Ireland). This in-house developed
system was controlled by a Pololu Wixel microcontroller (cat no. 785,
Cool Components Ltd.), which transmits communications to a user interface
via a universal serial bus (USB) and/or wirelessly (using a second
Pololu Wixel microcontroller). While this model does not contain a
motor, as microfluidic characterization was done using the previously
described “spin stand”, motor incorporation will be
done in future models similar to those described by Duffy et al.26,27,37

Figure 10 Detection system. This 3-D printed system
was designed to allow
in situ detection of MC-LR applied to the LOAD platform. It is configured
for a top-down detection method of the test reservoir (TR) (see reservoir three in Figure 8) with a 405 nm (REx) excitation source
(Exs), a 475 nm long pass filter (OF), and a
photo-LED emission detector (Pd) for collecting the emission
radiation (REm). The optical components are all stored
in a swappable “Optical Detection Block” and are adhered
to the bottom of the “Electronic Component Housing”
by screw (S). This in-house developed system is controlled by a Pololu
Wixel Microcontroller, stored in the “Electronic Component
Housing”, which can transmit communications to user via a USB
and/or wirelessly (using a second Pololu Wixel).

4.10 Measurement of Toxin Binding
The
preliminary assay was performed at room temperature in the laboratory
using the developed system box connected to a portable laptop facilitating
analysis via the Pololu Wixel software. The analysis was performed
by adding 100 μL of the lake water sample via a pipette to the
sample load zone on the disc. When spun at 35 Hz, the water sample
travels from the sample loading zone into the incubation zone. The
water sample is allowed to interact with the now reconstituted antibody
in the incubation zone for 10 minutes and the disc is spun again at
35 Hz. The water sample with potential toxin and resuspended antitoxin
antibody then advanced to the test zone, whereby toxin in the water
sample and toxin coated on the wells of the test zone compete for
binding to the fluorophore conjugated antibody. Bound antibody on
the wells of the test zone is inversely proportional to the amount
of toxin present in the water sample. The water sample continues through
to the control zone, whereby anti-chicken Abs capture the fluorophore-labeled
anti-chicken Abs; this signifies successful transition of the water
sample from the loading zone through the incubation and test zones
and to the control zone. The water sample then flows from the control
zone to the waste zone, and the fluorescent readings are measured.
Readings from the system are taken every 0.5 s; these values are exported
into excel and an average of 10 measurements is taken for each fluorescent
analysis.
