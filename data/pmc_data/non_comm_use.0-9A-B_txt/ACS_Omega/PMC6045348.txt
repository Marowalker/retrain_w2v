Two
new brominated bis(indole) alkaloids, dragmacidins I (1) and
J (2), showing low micromolar cytostatic activity, along with three
known congeners were isolated from the Tanzanian sponge Dragmacidon sp. and their structures determined by
the analysis of their NMR and MS data. From the study of their mechanism
of action, it can be concluded that the mitotic arrest at metaphase
in treated tumor cells, mediated by inhibition of PP1 and/or PP2A
phosphatases is involved in the observed antiproliferative activity.
Differences in their bioactivities were rationalized, and a plausible
binding mode is proposed on the basis of computational simulations.

1 Introduction
Oceans
hold about 80% of the Earth’s living organisms; however,
the majority of them remain unstudied. Many marine organisms are sessile
so they cannot move to escape from predators, and many have evolved
to be able to produce a variety of bioactive substances to help them
survive through chemical-mediated mechanisms. These molecules hold
a great promise for the development of new drugs.1,2 Among
these substances, diverse bioactive bis(indole) alkaloids such as
topsentins,3 hamacanthins,4 and dragmacidins5−8 have been isolated from different sponge orders such
as Halichondrida, Haplosclerida, and Verongida, as well as from the
tunicate Didemnum candidum.9 These compounds have shown a wide variety of
interesting activities when assayed as cytotoxic,10 antibacterial,10 α adrenergic
antagonists,11 protein phosphatase (PP),
and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors,12,13 or more recently
as antimalarial agents,14 confirming this
chemical scaffold as a promising drug lead. From a structural point
of view, the main difference between all of these compounds lies in
the nature of the cycle tethering of the two indole moieties. Thus,
topsentins contain an imidazole or a ketoimidazole ring, hamacanthins
a piperazinone or a dihydropyrazinone ring, and dragmacidins a piperazine
or a pyrazinone ring. To avoid confusion, it is worth mentioning that
dragmacidins A and B were originally named as dragmacidons A and B,6 despite the fact that the lead compound of this
series was designated as dragmacidin, 2 years before.3 Subsequently, all of the references about these compounds,
including their synthesis,15−17 have used the dragmacidin nomenclature,
as we have used in this work.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Isolation and Characterization
As
a result of our continuing efforts to find antitumor compounds from
marine organisms, we found that extracts obtained from the sponge Dragmacidon sp., collected off the coast of Tanzania
at a depth of 80 m, showed promising results in our bioassay-guided
screening program. The organic extract (CH2Cl2/CH3OH, 1:1) prepared from the frozen sample was fractionated
using C18 reverse-phase flash liquid chromatography. Subsequent fractionation
of the active portion using C18-HPLC was undertaken, yielding five
structurally related bioactive compounds: two new metabolites, dragmacidin
I (1) and dragmacidin J (2), along with
the already-known dragmacidin A (3),6 dragmacidin B (4),6 and didebromodragmacidin (5),15,16 although it should be noted that the latter (5) has
only been described as an intermediate in the total synthesis of 4 but not reported as a secondary metabolite isolated from
a natural source (Figure 1).

(6), and hamacanthin A (7).

2.2 Structural Elucidation
Dragmacidin
I (1), isolated as a brown powder, showed a molecular
formula of C21H21BrN4 based on its
HRESITOFMS (m/z 409.1053 and 411.1059
[M + H]+) and its 1H and 13C NMR
spectra (Table 1).
The observation of peaks at m/z 409
and 411 in a 1:1 ratio indicated the existence of a bromine atom within
the molecule. Analysis of the 1H, 13C NMR, and
gHSQC spectra showed the presence of 21 carbon atoms that could be
assigned as nine sp2 methines, two sp3 methylenes,
two sp3 methines, one methyl group, and seven nonprotonated
carbons. Analysis of gCOSY and gHMBC spectra allowed the assembly
of the planar structure of the molecule (Figure 2). Thus, the COSY cross-peak between H4′
and H5′ together with the observed gHMBC correlations between
H4′ and C3′, C6′, and C7a′, between H5′
and C7′ and C3a′, and between H2′ and C3a′
and C7a′ indicated the presence of a 6-bromoindol-3-yl moiety.
The H4″–H5″–H6″–H7″
spin system was established from gCOSY cross-peaks, which in combination
with gHMBC correlations between H4″ and C7a″, between
H7″ and C3a″, and between H2″ and C3″,
C3a″, and C7a″ indicated the presence of an indol-3-yl
moiety. The third fragment was established to be an N-methyl piperazine ring through gCOSY correlations between H2–H3
and H5–H6, in combination with three-bond correlations between
the methyl group at δH 2.89 and C3 and C5. Both indolyl
moieties were joined to the piperazine ring by the observed gHMBC
correlations between H2 and C2′, C3′, and C3a′,
together with the correlation between H5 and C3″.

The stereochemical relationships
within this molecule were solved
on the basis of the observed large coupling constants between H5–H6ax (3JH5–H6ax = 12.8 Hz) and H2–H3ax (3JH2–H3ax = 12.8 Hz), characteristic
of antiperiplanar-orientated protons along with the dipolar correlations
observed in the ROESY experiment between H3ax and H5ax as well as between H2ax and H6ax.
These data set the relative orientation of H2 and H5 as trans-diaxial,
indicating that both indolyl residues are in equatorial positions.
Further analysis of the ROESY experiment showed clear dipolar correlations
between the aromatic protons H4′ and H4″ with the piperazine
protons H2 and H5, respectively. Moreover, the indole proton H2′
cross-correlated with H3ax as did the corresponding H2″
with H6ax. From this information, it appears that both
indole rings adopt a perpendicular orientation relative to the main
plane of the piperazine moiety of 1, as depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Three-dimensional molecular
model of dragmacidin I (1). Dipolar interactions, as
detected by the ROESY experiment, are
depicted as red dashed lines.

Dragmacidin J (2) was isolated as a brown powder,
with a molecular formula of C22H23BrN4 based on its HRESITOFMS (m/z 423.1148
and 425.1145 [M + H]+), suggesting that, compared to 1, compound 2 bears an additional methyl group.
This observation was supported by the analysis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments
(see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) that clearly showed the presence of a new methyl group at δH/δC 2.88/40.5 and allowed the assignment
of all 1H and 13C signals, where the most notable
changes were observed in the chemical shifts of C2, C6, and C3′.
The relative orientation of the substituents at C2 and C5 was established
as trans-equatorial (3JH5–H6ax = 12.8 Hz and 3JH2–H3ax = 12.8 Hz), as proposed for 1.

Dragmacidin A (3), dragmacidin B (4),
and didebromodragmacidin (5) were studied and their HRESITOFMS
as well as their NMR data were compared with those reported in the
literature. Complete matches were found for all three compounds, thereby
confirming their structures.

The absolute configuration of the
new dragmacidins I (1) and J (2) is proposed
to be (2R,5S) on the basis of their
measured optical rotation values.
Thus, the positive specific rotations measured in methanol for 1 (+4.7, c 0.1) and 2 (+13.0, c 0.1) are very close to that reported for dragmacidin A
(+4, c 0.2) prepared by enantioselective total synthesis,14 clearly suggests an identical absolute configuration
for all of them.

2.3 Biological Activity
It has been reported
that some bis(indole) compounds show important biological activities.10−13 In particular, dragmacidins E and D were reported as inhibitors
of serine/threonine PPs, but no experimental details were published
by the authors.12 Therefore, all of the
isolated compounds (1–5) were evaluated to assess
their antiproliferative activity toward three different human cancer
cell lines: lung (A549), colon (HT29), and breast (MDA-MB-231). Three
molecules (1–3) revealed a significant bioactivity
against all of the tested cell lines (Table 2). Interestingly, nonsymmetric compounds 1, 2, and 3 proved to be clearly
more active than their two symmetrical partners 4 and 5. Although it has been described that molecular symmetry
is an important structural property in some cytotoxic compounds,18 this is a counterexample where in vitro activity
correlates with the spatial nonsymmetrical distribution more than
with the degree of substitution.

To get insights into
the mechanism of action of the active molecules,
both A549 (lung) and HeLa (cervix) carcinoma cells were treated with
compounds 1–4 at different concentrations, and
their actin and tubulin cytoskeletons were examined by immunofluorescence
with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. HeLa cells were
used at this stage because of their higher sensitivity to antimitotic
agents, therefore being more appropriate for microscopy studies. These
studies revealed that after treatment for 24 h at 10 μM, compounds 1–3 induced a mitotic arrest in metaphase in HeLa cells
that was independent of the disorganization of the tubulin cytoskeleton
because at this concentration, an important portion of the cells remained
phenotypically normal, and their microtubules were appropriately polymerized
(Figure 4). Furthermore,
A549 cells treated with compounds 1–4 at an identical
concentration (10 μM) did not show any effect on their cytoskeleton
and were not multinucleated as should be the case after treatment
with tubulin-binding agents. Confirmation of the previous observations
about the mitotic arrest induced by this class of compounds was obtained
by analyzing the cell cycle of the treated tumor cells by flow cytometry.
Thus, after 6 h of treatment with 10 μM of 4, a
clear G2/M arrest was observed, both in A549 and HeLa cells (see Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information). Indeed,
the ratio of A549 cells in G2/M increased from 11% in the control
to 30% after treatment with 4, whereas in HeLa cells,
the ratio moved from 15 to 48% (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information).

the effects of dragmacidins
in tumor cell cultures. Actin is shown in red, tubulin in green, and
DNA (stained with Hoechst 33342) in blue.

Next, we examined whether the observed cell cycle arrest
in metaphase
was because of the inhibition of a protein kinase involved in mitosis.
To this end, dragmacidin A (3) was tested against a full
panel of kinases including 28 cyclin-dependent kinases; 11 serine/threonine-protein
kinases NEK, PLK, and BUB1; and aurora A, B, and C kinases (a detailed
list is included in the Supporting Information). However, none of them was significantly inhibited at the tested
concentration (10 μM), indicating that the mechanism of action
of these compounds does not implicate the inhibition of these proteins.
We then analyzed whether dragmacidins were inhibiting phosphatases,
the kinases’ counteracting partners that are also essential
for the dynamics of cell cycle. We treated HeLa cells with 10 μM
of compounds 1–4 for 1, 6, and 24 h, monitoring
the phosphorylation status of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), an
essential cell cycle controller which is regulated through dephosphorylation
by PPs, PP1 and PP2A. As a result, we observed a continuous increment
of the pRB phosphorylation status in HeLa cells after 1, 6, and 24
h of exposure to dragmacidins 1–4, showing that
this family of compounds effectively inhibits PP1 and/or PP2A phosphatases.
Similar results were observed in A549 cells where the hyperphosphorylation
of pRB increased after 1 and 6 h of incubation, but subsequently turned
down, resulting in a hypophosphorylated protein after 24 h. We also
analyzed the phosphorylation status of AURKA and AURKB, both kinases
being essential in the transition from metaphase to anaphase during
mitosis and both of them targets of PPs, PP1 and PP2A. Again, we could
see an increase in the phosphorylation of both kinases, clear after
1 h of treatment with the compounds and remaining high after 24 h
of treatment (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Western blot assays undertaken on HeLa (left) and A549 (right)
cells extract to monitor the phosphorylation status of the pRB (P-pRB).

Therefore, our conclusion was
that mitotic arrest at metaphase
in treated tumor cells mediated by inhibition of PP1 and/or PP2A phosphatases
is involved in—if not responsible for—the observed antiproliferative
activity of dragmacidins 1–4. This statement was
corroborated by evaluating compounds 1–5 in vitro
to test their inhibition of the PP1 phosphatase. Residual activities
of 48.7 ± 6.0%, 45.3 ± 4.2%, 54.3 ± 5.5%, 102.3 ±
13.0%, and 101.0 ± 4.4% were, respectively, obtained after incubation
of the enzyme with a 10 μM concentration of 1–5 in our assays, indicating that compounds 1–3 have an IC50 value close to 10 μM, whereas 4–5 did not show significant inhibition at the tested
concentration. These values are on the same order of magnitude as
those obtained from the cytotoxicity assays.

Dragmacidins do
not share a common structural characteristic of
most PP1 and PP2A inhibitors, that is, the presence of a negatively
charged residue, generally a phosphate or a carboxylic acid, to mimic
the phosphate group that these proteins hydrolyze.19,20 In addition, despite compounds 1–5 representing
only a small series of structural variations, their structure–activity
relationships turned out to be intriguing. The loss of in vitro activity
observed in 4 and 5 is difficult to understand,
as their structural variations are small compared to 1–3. Thus, we first looked at potential differences in pKa values among 1–5 as a possible explanation.
Dragmacidins are weak bases and in consequence, variations in their
neutral/charged ratios may have an impact on their ability to cross
cell membranes. Therefore, pKa values
for each compound (1–5) were calculated using
a combination of molecular mechanics (MM) and DFT computational methods,
as implemented in the jaguar pKa software21 (Table 3). Smaller pKa values were obtained
in our calculations for the piperazine moiety of compounds 1–3 and therefore there would be a smaller ionized fraction of them
under the assayed conditions (i.e., at pH = 7.4, 83% ionization for
a pKa = 8.1 in 5 vs 64% for
pKa = 7.5 in 3). Considering
that the neutral form of a drug is more lipid-soluble, this would
result in a better diffusion of 1–3 into the cell.
Although differences between the predicted pKa values are small, results become more reliable because the
differences between predicted values are calculated more accurately
than absolute pKa values themselves because
of the cancellation of systematic errors.21 This calculated physicochemical outcome is in accordance with the
experimentally measured bioactivities and may provide a rationale
for the observed variations.

Next, in an attempt to understand the basis of the observed differences
in bioactivity, simulations of docking 1–5 into
the binding pocket of PP1 were performed.22−25 Metalloproteins, such as PP1
that includes two manganese atoms on its binding pocket, are challenging
systems to model because of the limitation of currently available
force fields treating transition metal atoms. In this case, for our
calculations, we decided to keep one crystallographic water molecule
directly coordinated with both metal ions.26,27 This was because after inspection of PP1 crystallographic structures
in complex with different inhibitors, it turned out that this water
molecule was a common feature of all of them.22−25 To predict protein–ligand
binding, we used a three-step procedure: first, electrostatic charges
were calculated for all protein residues located at less than 3A of
the metal ions using DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level.28 These charges were then used to perform a quantum
mechanics/MM (QM/MM) docking. This step improves the treatment of
partial charges induced by the receptor on the ligands, obtaining
them from QM calculations.29 Finally, the
10 best binding poses obtained from QM/MM docking of each ligand were
evaluated using MM-generalized Born surface area (GBSA) calculations.30 The last calculations were used to estimate
relative binding affinities, and although the absolute values calculated
are not necessarily in agreement with experimental binding affinities,
the relative ranking of the ligands is expected to agree reasonably
well, particularly in the case of congeneric series, as it is the
case. Taking into account that the previously calculated pKa values were close to the physiological pH,
calculations were performed using both ionized and nonionized states
for all ligands.

Our simulations resulted in two general binding
trends. One set
of poses filling the hydrophobic groove and a second set of solutions
filling the acidic groove of the PP1 binding site. In most cases,
the conformation of the bound ligand remained similar to that of the
free status; this is with both indole rings oriented in a plane perpendicular
to the central piperazine ring. As we expected, because of the absence
of negatively charge groups in 1–5, few simulations
resulted in ligands directly interacting with the metals in the active
site. Thus, 1, the ligand with the best bioactivity,
showed the most negative interaction energy (ΔGbinding = −42.6 kcal/mol) on its nonprotonated
state bound into the hydrophobic groove. An analysis of its binding
interactions indicated that π–π stacking interactions
as well as H-bonds between both indole rings and the protein stabilizes
the complex of 1 with PP1 (Figure 6). On the other hand, ligands 2 and 3 displayed their best binding affinities on its
protonated form bound into the hydrophobic groove. However, while 2 seems to keep the same position as 1 into the
binding site, ligand 3 turned out to be slightly shifted
down into the hydrophobic groove, possibly because of its larger size
as it includes an additional bromine atom, resulting in 1 in each indole moiety now. Equally, 4 showed its best
affinity on its protonated state, forming a complex almost superimposable
with that obtained for 3. However, according to our results,
the new N-methyl group of 4 shows unfavorable
electrostatic interactions mainly with the indolic NH of Trp 206,
something that could explain its lower bioactivity. Finally, didebromodragmacidin 5, the ligand with the lowest bioactivity, was the only one
that showed binding poses exclusively within the acidic groove of
the PP1 binding site.

3 Conclusions
Two new congeners of the dragmacidin family of alkaloids have been
isolated from the marine sponge Dragmacidon sp. together with the other related metabolites. These molecules
were tested in antiproliferative activity assays resulting in low
micromolar activities. Their mechanism of action was investigated
through different molecular biology experiments that indicated that
these molecules act via inhibition of Ser–Thr PPs. Moreover,
according to our simulations, dragmacidins bind PP1 by filling the
hydrophobic groove of the binding site, not directly interacting with
the metal atoms of the protein but blocking the access of target protein
phosphate groups into the catalytic site in a way that may represent
a new paradigm to inhibit Ser–Thr PPs type 1 and possibly other
analogous phosphatases such as PP2A.

4 Methods
4.1 General
Optical rotations were measured
on a Jasco P-1020 polarimeter. UV spectra were obtained using an Agilent
1100 DAD. IR spectra were acquired on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR
spectrometer with ATR sampling. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian
“Unity 500” spectrometer operating at 500/125 MHz (1H/13C), approximately. Chemical shifts were reported
in parts per million using residual acetone-d6 signal (δH 2.05 and δC 29.84)
as the internal reference. HRESITOFMS spectra were acquired on an
Agilent 6230 TOF LC/MS chromatograph spectrometer. HPLC purifications
were performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with a Gilson FC204
fraction collector and a DAD G1315B Agilent detector.

4.2 Sponge Material
The sponge Dragmacidon sp. was collected in Kashani Island (039°
36′ 937″ E, 05° 08′ 010″ S), Tanzania,
in February 2010, by autonomous diving using a closed-circuit rebreather
at a depth of −80 m. The sample was immediately frozen at −20
°C. A voucher specimen was identified by Dr. Santiago Bueno Horcajadas
and deposited at PharmaMar (ORMA086310).

4.3 Extraction
and Isolation
The frozen
organism (125 g) was triturated and extracted 3 times using 500 mL
of a 1:1 mixture of CH2Cl2/CH3OH.
The combined extracts were concentrated to give a dry brownish crude
(12.3 g), which was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography on Polygoprep
RP-18 stationary phase with a stepped gradient started with H2O, subsequently followed by CH3OH and CH3OH/CH2Cl2 (50:50). The fraction eluted with
CH3OH was further purified by HPLC using a Sunfire Prep
C18 column (5 μm; 10 × 150 mm; Waters), with a gradient
of CH3CN/H2O (+0.04% TFA) starting from 20%
H2O that rose to 50% in 20 min (flow rate 3 mL/min and
UV detection at 254 nm). This procedure yielded compounds 1 (6.8 mg, tR = 7.9 min), 2 (11.7 mg, tR = 10.7), 3 (2.5 mg, tR = 12.0 min), 4 (2.4 mg, tR = 15.3 min), and 5 (0.7 mg, tR = 6.6 min).

and 425.1164).

4.5 Biological Evaluation
4.5.1 Antiproliferative Assays
A549 (ATCC
CCL-185) lung carcinoma, HT29 (ATCC HTB-38) colon adenocarcinoma,
MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) breast adenocarcinoma, and HeLa (ATCC CRM-CCL-2)
cervix adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine. Cell cultures were always kept at the low-passage stage.

A colorimetric assay with sulforhodamine B (SRB) was used to determine
the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. Briefly, cells were
seeded in 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to stand for 24 h
in drug-free medium before treatment with vehicle alone or a range
of 10 serial half dilutions starting from 20 μM of the compounds
for 72 h. For quantification, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), fixed for 15 min in 1% glutaraldehyde solution, rinsed
twice with PBS, stained in 0.4% SRB-1% acetic acid solution for 30
min, rinsed several times with 1% acetic acid solution, and air-dried.
SRB was then extracted with 10 mM Trizma base solution and the optical
density measured at 490 nm in a POLARstar Omega microplate multilabel
reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). All evaluations were performed
in triplicate, and the resulting data were fitted by nonlinear regression
to a four-parameter logistic curve with Prism v5.0 software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), following the algorithm developed by
the American National Cancer Institute (NCI).1 This algorithm calculates the GI50 value, the compound
concentration that produces 50% of the cell growth inhibition as compared
to control cultures, a convenient measure of the activity of cytostatic
compounds.

4.5.2 Immunofluorescence
Cells were treated
with the appropriate concentration of the compounds for 24 h, then
fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100), and
incubated with appropriate primary and secondary fluorescence-conjugated
antibodies, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Preparations
were counterstained with Hoechst 33342, labeling DNA, and mounted
with Mowiol mounting medium. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert
200M microscope equipped with a 63× oil-immersion objective,
an Axiocam HRm digital camera, and an Apotome-1 structured illumination
system (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

4.5.3 Western
Blot
Cell protein extracts
were prepared following standard procedures in RIPA buffer in the
presence of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics) and
phosphatase inhibitors (PhosStop, Roche Diagnostics). After quantification
with BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA),
15–25 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After
using appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, blots were developed
by a peroxidase reaction using the ECL detection system (Amersham-G.E.
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) with a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).

4.5.4 Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
Cells were treated with 10 μM of the assayed compounds for
6 h and subsequently washed with PBS and fixed with 70% cold ethanol.
Cells were then treated with RNAse I and stained with 50 μg/mL
propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed with a BD Accuri-6 flow cytometer
(Becton and Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the FlowJo v10.1
cytometry analysis software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).

4.5.5 PP Inhibition Assays
Ser–Thr
PP-1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (P7937).
The EnzCheck Phosphatase Assay Kit from Molecular Probes was used
to monitor the phosphatase activity. This kit uses 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl
phosphate (DiFMUP) as a substrate for the enzyme. Assays were performed
at 25 °C using 0.2 units of protein and 10 μM of the tested
compounds (1–5) in a volume of 100 μL of
pH 7.4 buffer-containing 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 2 mM DTT, 1
mM EDTA, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.025% TWEEN 20, and 20% (v/v) glycerol.
DiFMUP (5 μM) was used as a substrate, essentially following
the method provided with the reactive. The hydrolysis reaction was
monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy at λex of
360 nM and λem of 460 nM. Assays were performed in
triplicate, and errors are described as standard deviation from the
average.

4.6 Computational Chemistry
4.6.1 Conformational Searches
Molecular
modeling calculations were carried out using Macromodel software.31 Conformational searches of dragmacidins 1–5 were undertaken using 1000 steps of a hybrid method
that included torsional and low-mode sampling. All searches were carried
out under the OPLS3 force field using a dielectric constant value
equivalent to the solvent that was used for the NMR measurements (acetone,
ε = 20.7). No bond restrains were applied, and all conformations
within 12 kJ·mol–1 of the lowest energy structure
were saved for further analysis.

4.6.2 pKa Calculations
Prediction of pKa values was undertaken
by quantum mechanical calculations in solution phase (water) using
selected conformations for each molecule as the input.20 A first step of geometry optimization of both
of the protonated and nonprotonated forms of each molecule were carried
out using the B3LYP functional and 6-31G* basis set. Next, single-point
calculations were performed in solution and gas phases at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ
level of theory using the PBF implicit solvation model for evaluation
of the solvation energies. Finally, the resultant solvation energies
were corrected by a set of empirical parameters as implemented in
the software Jaguar.

4.6.3 Docking and Binding Energy
Calculations
The Glide software package as implemented within
the Schrodinger
suite was used to propose binding modes of dragmacidins 1–5 to the catalytic subunit of PP1.32,33 Hence, the
protein file was prepared using the coordinates of the PP1–okadaic
acid complex (1JK7) after ligand removal.18 The comparison between the different crystallographic structures
available for PP1 showed only small differences in the protein structure
and a conserved water molecule coordinated with metal ions. Therefore,
this water molecule was used in our calculations. The Quantum Mechanics
Polarized Ligand Docking protocol as implemented in the Glide software
was used as follows: an initial rigid receptor docking was performed
generating initial charges with a semiempirical method and using the
XP (extra precision) mode. Top five poses were used to derive partial
atomic charges induced by the protein using electrostatic potential
fitting using the accurate option (6-31G*/LACVP* basis set with the
B3LYP functional). Finally, the ligands including the new charges
were redocked using XP mode, and a maximum of 10 poses of each were
saved. Calculations were performed using both ionized and nonionized
states for all ligands. The docking area was set around the active
site.

MM-GBSA calculations were undertaken using Prime as implemented
within the Schrodinger suite. QM charges and positions for all ligands
obtained from the docking calculations were used. Residues within
a distance of 3.0 Å of the ligands were considered as flexible,
and an implicit VSGB2.0 solvation model was used for the calculations.
The MM-GBSA protocol included receptor, ligand, and receptor–ligand
complex minimizations followed by energy calculations of ligands and
receptor extracted from optimized receptor–ligand complex.
The resultant binding poses were ranked on the basis of their binding
free energies.
