This work focussed on the synthesis of a new catalytic material
isinglass (IG)-based Fe3O4@GA@IG core/shell
magnetic nanoparticles and the investigation of its catalytic activity
in two important multicomponent reactions. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared using a simple coprecipitation method
and then coated with IG consisting predominantly of the protein collagen
in the presence of glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. The obtained
hybrid material has been characterized by Fourier transform infrared
analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), vibrating sample magnetometry, energy-dispersive X-ray, X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analyses.
The results of XRD analysis implied that the prepared nanocomposite
consists of two compounds of crystalline magnetite and amorphous IG,
and the formation of its core/shell structure had been confirmed by
TEM images. The catalytic performance of the as-prepared core/shell
bionanocatalyst was evaluated for the first time in the synthesis
of 1,4-dihydropyridine and 4H-pyran derivatives under
sonication in ethanol. This core/shell structure because of the superparamagnetic
property of Fe3O4 and unique properties of IG
as a bifunctional biocatalyst offers a high potential for many catalytic
applications. Recycling study revealed that no significant decrease
in the catalytic activity was observed even after six runs.

1 Introduction
In recent years, sonochemistry
as one of the greenest and effective techniques has been considered
in the synthesis of various bulk and nanomaterials. The synthesis
of substances by ultrasonic irradiation requires less amounts of solvents
and catalysts, which better meets the ecological requirements. In
the liquid medium, cavitation is the predominant phenomenon induced
by ultrasound. The phenomenon of acoustic cavitation corresponds to
the creation, growth, and then implosion (collapse) of bubbles formed
when a liquid is subjected to a periodic pressure wave. The implosion
of the bubble then locally causes the release of a large amount of
thermal energy (locally, the temperature can reach 5000 °C and
the pressure of several hundred atmospheres) and mechanical energy
(jet emission of liquids moving at a speed of 100 meters per second)
without any significant change in the whole medium (in terms of temperature
and pressure).1,2 Because of its unusual properties,
this technique has been extensively used.

The development of
new hybrid materials combining organic and inorganic compounds to
improve their properties for catalytic applications is a challenge
that has always existed. In the field of the development of adaptive
materials, hybrid materials with a polymer component make it possible
to answer a large number of environmental or societal problems via
biomimetic approaches. Nature has always combined organic and inorganic
components, at the nanoscale, to construct smart materials with remarkable
properties and functions (mechanics, density, permeability, color,
hydrophobicity, etc.). Shellfish carapaces, mollusk shells, bones,
and tissues are examples of organic–inorganic natural materials.3−5

The field of functional
materials is in constant search of materials with innovative properties.
Depending on the functions involved, it is advantageous to combine
properties of the material, normally present in different materials.
One of the ways of increasing the number of interesting properties
that a nanoparticle (NP) possesses is through the formation of particles
with a core/shell structure.3 Such a structure
often makes it possible to combine the properties of two very different
types of particles. Magnetic core/shell NPs have a huge potential
for application because of the range of properties that can be envisaged
for this type of materials.4,5 Magnetically separable
NPs can be functionalized with catalysts, working then at the boundary
between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, both being “in
the solution” and separable by the application of an external
magnetic field, resulting in remarkable catalyst recovery without
the need for a filtration step.6

Isinglass (IG) was derived from the swim bladders of certain tropical
fish and consists predominantly of the protein collagen, which is
readily soluble in organic acids. IG collagen exists as a rodlike
triple helical molecule and is thermally labile.7 IG consists of 90 basic side chain groups and 118 acid
groups per thousand total residues. Because 41 of the acidic groups
are in the amide form, there is an excess of basic groups and the
protein; therefore, it has a basic character, that is, has a basic
isoionic pH.8 The total hydroxyl content
of IG is high and in consequence has high hydrogen bonding capacity;
thus, it is capable of bonding with many groups, such as C=O,
OH, and so forth, on other compounds. Therefore, in continuation of
our works using bionanocatalysts in organic synthesis,9,10 we planned to functionalize Fe3O4 magnetic
NPs (MNPs) with IG to prepare a bionanocatalyst for use in organic
synthesis.

1,4-Dihydropyridine (1,4-DHP) and 4H-pyran structural architectures occur in many bioactive natural products
and synthetic drugs, and these structural units serve as important
chemical intermediates.11−13 Consequently, several methods have been reported to promote their
preparation.14−40 Although most of these processes offer distinct advantages,
some of them suffer from a few limitations such as prolonged and tedious
catalyst preparation, using expensive and hazardous reagents and solvents,
besides more catalyst loading.38 Therefore,
to overcome these disadvantages, a great deal of efforts is directed
to develop a novel biocompatible catalytic system for the synthesis
of these compounds. As a result, the present core/shell Fe3O4@GA@IG as a bionanocatalyst has been prepared (Scheme 1) and has been studied
for the first time in the synthesis of 1,4-DHP and 4H-pyran derivatives via the one-pot multicomponent condensation of
an aldehyde, a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, and ammonium acetate under
sonication condition in ethanol.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Fe3O4@GA@IG
The prepared magnetic nanocomposite Fe3O4@GA@IG
structure was elucidated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) analysis, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) technique, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).

On the basis of the FT-IR spectra of Fe3O4@GA@IG,
the presence of IG and Fe3O4 can be clearly
observed by the characteristic absorption peaks present at 550 cm–1 related to Fe–O vibration (Figure 1c). Because of the fact that
IG has a collagen structure, the main absorption bands were 3444–3100,
2900–2893, 1649, 1369, 1155, and 1074 cm–1. The absorptions bands at 1369 and 1155 cm–1 might
be accredited to the ν(C–N) and δ(N–H) absorptions
of amide II, respectively. Amide I band associated with ν(C=O)
absorptions could be found at 1649 cm–1, the peaks
at 2900–2893 cm–1 were attributed to ν(CH2) and ν(CH3) of amide B, and the band between
3444 and 3110 cm–1 corresponds to N–H stretching
of amide A. Peak shifts of amide in Fe3O4@GA@IG
were clearly observed (1649 in IG to 1651 cm–1 in
Fe3O4@GA@IG). The observed shift in the infrared
spectra is related to the chemical interaction between Fe3O4@GA NPs and IG.

As can be seen from the SEM analysis
shown in Figure 2b,
the average particle size was 63 nm. These images show a homogeneous
and monotonous surface of the bionanocatalyst. Moreover, to verify
the core/shell nanostructure of the as-prepared bionanocatalyst, its
TEM images were provided. As shown in Figure 2c, the black centers represent the Fe3O4 core and the brightest areas show the IG shell.

Figure 2 (a,b) SEM and
(c) TEM
images of the as-prepared Fe3O4@GA@IG core/shell
nanocomposite.

The EDX analysis revealed that Fe, O, C, S, and N are the main
elements present in the bionanocomposite with Fe being the most abundant
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 EDX analysis of Fe3O4@GA@IG.

The
hysteresis loops of Fe3O4 MNPs and Fe3O4@GA@IG are exposed in Figure 4. As shown in the figure, the magnetization
decreases from plateau state to zero on removal of the magnetic field
for both NPs; neither coercivity (Hc) nor remanent magnetization (Mr)
was observed in the hysteresis curves, which clearly indicates their
superparamagnetic nature. The coverage of the surface of Fe3O4 NPs by IG is the origin of the reduction in saturation
magnetization.

of Fe3O4@GA@IG.

TGA was carried out under inert nitrogen gas
at a steady speed of 10 °C/min and 800 °C temperature.

As shown in the curve of Figure 5, the first mass loss of the magnetic bionanocatalyst
occurred below 240 °C, which can be attributed to water thermodesorption
from the surface (drying), whereas the second weight loss above 240
°C is associated with the release of hydroxyl ions from the NPs
and volatilization. The third mass loss occurred at 411 °C and
is due to the combustion of all carbon content.

Figure 5 TGA analysis
of Fe3O4@GA@IG.

According to
the results of BET analysis, the specific surface area of the bionanocatalyst
was 28.15 m2/g. The volume of the single-point adsorption
cavity is 0.142816 cm3/g, and the single-point cavity dissipation
volume is 0.159 cm3/g. The particle size is 20 nm. Figure 6 shows the nitrogen
absorption and depletion diagram of magnetic Fe3O4@GA@IG. The specific surface area of the IG catalyst is 1.20 m2/g, and the cavity volume of the single point is 0.0024 cm3/g. Also, Figure 6 shows the absorption and desorption diagram of nitrogen of
IG. Because of the presence of Fe3O4 NPs, the
catalyst has a significant increase in the specific surface area.

of Fe3O4@GA@IG.

The XRD pattern of the magnetic nanocatalyst has been illustrated
in Figure 7. In the
XRD pattern of Fe3O4@GA@IG, on the basis of
JCPDS card#19-629, the positions of diffraction peaks at 2θ
= 30°, 35°,43°, 53°, 57°, 62°, and 74°
were attributed to (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440), and (533)
of Fe3O4 NPs, which was surrounded by the IG
shell. Forasmuch as the main peaks of Fe3O4@GA@IG
are the same as those of pure Fe3O4 NPs, which
means that the crystal structure of Fe3O4 NPs
is well-maintained even after the procedure of making a new MNP catalyst.
Wide peaks of diffraction angles 10–23 are related to the amorphous
property of IG on the surface of Fe3O4 NPs.

2.2 Synthesis of 1,4-DHP
and Polyhydroquinoline Derivatives by Fe3O4@GA@IG
The catalytic activity of Fe3O4@GA@IG was
investigating in a pseudofour component reaction for the synthesis
of polyhydroquinoline and 1,4-DHP derivatives. To obtain the optimal
conditions, the reaction between 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (2b), ethyl acetoacetate (3), dimedone (4),
and ammonium acetate (6) with 1:1:1:1 molar ratios and
the reaction between 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (2b), dimedone
(4) or cyclohexanedione (5), and ammonium
acetate (6) with 1:2:1 molar ratios were selected as
the model reactions for the synthesis of polyhydroquinoline and 1,4-DHP,
respectively.

The effects of various parameters such as the
catalyst, solvent, temperature, and energy sources were investigated
on the rate and yield of the polyhydroquinoline and 1,4-DHP synthesis
reaction (Table 1).
As can be seen (Table 1, entry 1–4), in the absence of any catalyst, with or without
solvent, at room temperature or at reflux in ethanol, the reaction
yield was very low. The effect of ultrasound on the reaction rate
is well-evinced, although the reaction time decreases to half, but
the yield remains mediocre (entry 5). When Fe3O4@GA@IG (5 mg) was used as the catalyst in ethanol at room temperature,
the yield increased moderately (entry 6); however, the increase in
catalyst loading has not been favorable. Obviously, we studied the
synergistic effect of ultrasound and the catalyst, and as expected,
the yield has increased remarkably, whereas the reaction time has
decreased (entry 9). The reaction was carried out in other solvents,
such as water, acetonitrile, and chloroform, but none of these solvents
were found to be effective. Finally, to show that the catalytic characteristics
of the components of the hybrid material have been improved, Fe3O4 and IG were used separately (entries 17, 18).
As could be guessed, the use of this hybrid system shows a higher
activity and higher yield in a shorter reaction time. As a result,
the optimum condition was the use of 10 mg of Fe3O4@GA@IG under ultrasonic irradiation in ethanol as the solvent
(entry 15).

To further explore the effectiveness of the Fe3O4@GA@IG bionanocatalyst and extend the scope of
this protocol, the reaction between various aromatic aldehydes 2a–l, ammonium acetate (6), and 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds 3, 4, and 5 under
optimized conditions was realized, and the results are shown in Table 2.

The two pathways
[A] and [B] of the plausible mechanism consist of a sequence of consecutive
reactions proposed in Scheme 2. In path [A], the reaction proceeds through an acid–base
bifunctional catalyst. Initially, the acidic sites of the bionanocatalyst
activated the aldehyde by protonation; on the other hand, the acidic
hydrogen of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds was captured by the amine
group of the bionanocatalyst; these electrophiles and nucleophiles
reacted together and created the Knoevenagel intermediate [I] that undergoes a Michael reaction with the second enolizable 1,3-dicarbonyl
compound producing the intermediate [II]. The Michael
product [II] reacted with ammonium acetate forming an
enamine that endures intramolecular cyclization followed by dehydration,
yielding the desired product.

A comparison between this work
and previous reported methods for the synthesis of 1,4-DHP and polyhydroquinoline

2.3 Synthesis of 2-Amino-4H-pyran Derivatives by
Fe3O4@GA@IG
To reach the optimal conditions,
the reaction between 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (2b), dimedone
(5), and malononitrile (9) with 1:1:1 molar
ratios was selected as the model reaction. The effects of various
parameters such as the catalyst, solvent, temperature, and energy
sources on the rate and yield of the 2-amino-4H-pyran
derivatives were investigated for the model reaction (Table 4). As the results indicate,
the optimum condition was the use of 20 mg of Fe3O4@GA@IG under reflux in ethanol (entry 11).

are demonstrated in Table 5.

2.4 Investigating the Recyclability
of Fe3O4@GA@IG in Hantzsch Reaction
One of the advantages of heterogeneous catalysts is the easy separation
and recyclability. In this regard, the recyclability and reuse of
the magnetic bionanocatalyst was evaluated in the model reaction.
At the end of the reaction, Fe3O4@GA@IG was
collected by an external magnetic field and then washed with ethyl
acetate, normal hexane, and ethanol and then dried in an oven at 50
°C. The recycled magnetic nanocatalyst was used for six consecutive
times in the model reaction. According to the results illustrated
in Figure 8, there
is no appreciable reduction in the efficiency of the Fe3O4@GA@IG catalyst. FTIR spectra of the recycled catalyst
were recorded after six cycles and compared with the fresh catalyst
(Figure 1c,d). It can
be clearly seen that the used catalyst has not undergone any structural
changes.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a new biocompatible IG-based core/shell MNP, Fe3O4@GA@IG, was prepared, characterized, and its
catalytic activity was verified. Fe3O4@GA@IG
was proven to be a bionanocatalyst for the synthesis of 1,4-DHP and
4H-pyran derivatives via two one-pot three-component
reactions under sonication in ethanol. This method offers several
advantages such as the use of ultrasound waves as an alternative green
source of energy, omitting toxic solvents or catalysts, good yields,
short reaction times, very simple workup, magnetically separable,
recyclable, and green catalyst obtained from a natural source. This
catalyst showed suitable recyclability with no significant yield decrease
after six runs. Given its performance, it can be used in other acid–base-catalyzed
reactions.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
All reagents and materials were purchased from commercial sources
and used without purification. All of them were analytical grade.
The swim bladders were obtained from common carp of Caspian Sea. SEM
analysis was performed by using KYKY-EM3200 (26 kV). TEM analysis
was carried out by EM10C-100 kV. XRD analysis was done by Holland
Philips Xpert, Co K and ultrasonicated by Topsonics, 20 KHz, 400 W. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE
DPX 500. The chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts per million
and referenced to the tetramethylsilane internal standard. IR spectra
were recorded in KBr on a Shimadzu FT-IR spectrometer and were reported
in wavenumbers (cm–1). All melting points were measured
on a capillary melting point apparatus.

4.2 General Procedure for the Preparation of Fe3O4 NPs
The MNPs was synthesized using
a coprecipitation method described previously.41 In a typical procedure, FeCl3·6H2O (5.20 g) and FeCl2·4H2O (2.00 g) (Fe2+/Fe3+ = 2:1) were dissolved in deionized water
(25 mL) purged with N2 to get a homogenous solution. Chemical
precipitation was performed by the slow addition of NaOH solution
(1.50 mg L–1), under vigorous stirring at 80 °C
for 60 min, until the pH = 10 was reached. The precipitate was separated
from the solution by an external magnetic field, washed three times
with deionized water and ethanol (25 mL), and dried in an oven at
65 °C for 24 h.

4.3 General Procedure for the Preparation of Fe3O4@GA@IG
Initially, Fe3O4 (0.1 g) and
glutaraldehyde (10 mL) were sonicated in ethanol (15 mL) for 15 min.
Then, IG (0.1 g) was added to the flask and the mixture was sonicated
for 1 h. The prepared magnetite IG was separated by an external magnet
and placed in an oven at 60–70 °C for 24 h.

4.4 General Procedure for the Synthesis
of 1,4-DHP and Polyhydroquinoline Derivatives
A mixture of
aldehyde (1.0 mmol), ammonium acetate (1.0 mmol), 1,3-dicarbonyl (2.0
mmol), and Fe3O4@GA@IG (10 mg) in ethanol (2.0
mL) as the solvent was placed into a round-bottom flask and irradiated
by an ultrasonic probe sonicator. To synthesize polyhydroquinolin
derivatives, aldehyde (1.0 mmol), ammonium acetate (1.0 mmol), dimedone
(140.2 mg, 1.0 mmol), 1,3-dicarbonyl (1.0 mmol), and Fe3O4@GA@IG (10 mg) in ethanol (2.0 mL) were placed into
a round-bottom flask and sonicated. The reaction progression was surveyed
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using ethyl acetate/hexane (1:3)
as the eluent. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was
removed by an external magnet. The pure product was obtained after
recrystallization from alcohol–water.

4.5 General Procedure for the Synthesis of 4H-Pyran Derivatives
A mixture of aldehyde (1.0
mmol), malononitrile (66 mg, 1.0 mmol), 1,3-dicarbonyl (1.0 mmol),
and Fe3O4@GA@IG (20 mg) in ethanol (3 mL) was
stirred at the reflux condition. The reaction progress was checked
by means of TLC technique using ethyl acetate/normal hexane (1:3)
as the eluent. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was
removed by an external magnet and the product was crystalized and
separated from the residual solution by cooling.
