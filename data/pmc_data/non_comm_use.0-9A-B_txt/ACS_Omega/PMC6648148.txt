Alkaloid
extract from Rauvolfia macrophylla Stapf
(AERMS) was studied as the corrosion inhibitor for C38 steel
in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 using electrochemistry
and surface analysis. The corrosion inhibition was efficient and proceeds
via adsorption of AERMS on the steel surface due to the active functional
groups present in the molecules. AERMS acts as a mixed inhibitor in
HCl and as a cathodic inhibitor in H2SO4. In
H2SO4 corrosive medium, the presence of iodides
improves the adsorption of the alkaloid molecules by reducing the
surface charge of the electrode and thus substantially decreases the
corrosion rate. Two pure alkaloids (tetrahydroalastonine (THA) and
perakine (PER)) were quantitatively isolated from AERMS, and their
anticorrosive properties for C38 steel in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 were evaluated. THA showed the highest efficiency
while the performance of PER was less important compared to the extract.
This confirms that the efficiency of AERMS was the result of the complementary
action of the chemical compounds present in the extract.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
pickling process, cleaning and removal of localized deposits
(rust, bacterial deposits, calculus, etc.) from pipes and other steel
based structures used in industries, are generally performed in concentrated
acid solutions.1−12 These aggressive milieus easily corrode metals during the cleaning
process. Inhibitors are frequently added to the acidic solution before
application to prevent or reduce corrosion. At relatively low concentrations,
inhibitors can substantially reduce metal corrosion.13,14 The most commonly used inhibitors in acid medium are organic compounds
whose efficiency is attributed to the presence of heteroatoms (O,
N, S, and P) in their structures.8,15−20 These heteroatoms can coordinate with iron(II) resulting from steel
corrosion, forming complexes at the metal surface, thereby serving
as a barrier to aggressive agents.13,16

Nitrogen-rich
compounds are attractive as corrosion inhibitors.
The large amount of nitrogen-rich corrosion inhibitors are synthetic
compounds.13,21−23 However, it
was shown recently that natural compounds extracted from plants also
display very interesting properties.6,7,15,24 Moreover, plant extracts
have the advantage of being less expensive, easily obtained, renewable,
highly biodegradable, available, and especially nontoxic to the environment.25,26 Among these natural nitrogen-rich compounds extracted from plants
and used as corrosion inhibitors, alkaloids represent the most important
family. The size, functionalities, and geometry of these molecules
are determining parameters that explain their efficiencies when used
as corrosion inhibitors.27

Alkaloid
extract of various origins have been shown to have excellent
corrosion inhibition properties toward C38 steel in acidic media,
mainly HCl.15,16,28−30 Some other studies also reported that these inhibition
properties decrease slightly when the temperature of the corrosive
solution was increased.14,31 In general, the activity
of these compounds as corrosion inhibitors are explained by the formation
of a passive layer at the metal surface, which reduces its accessibility
to corrosion agents.15 Although the nature
and the chemical composition of this passive layer are not well elucidated
yet; it is obvious that it consists mainly of a mixture of the alkaloids
and corrosion products.15,16

Cameroon, with
its large forest and exceptional biodiversity, is
considered as a reservoir of natural substances with interesting pharmacologic
applications. Indeed, lots of compounds have been isolated from local
plants by organic chemists,32 many of which
are alkaloids that are potential corrosion inhibitors. Rauvolfia macrophylla Stapf (RMS) is a Cameroonian
medicinal plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. This plant contains
huge alkaloid fraction and is highly solicited in traditional medicine,
especially in the treatment of various diseases like rheumatism, hepatitis,
and malaria. Despite, its high alkaloid content, the use of RMS as
a corrosion inhibitor has never been reported to the best of our knowledge.

The aim of this work is to investigate the corrosion inhibitory
properties of alkaloid extract from RMS on C38 steel in 1 M hydrochloric
acid and 0.5 M sulfuric acid media. This included the elucidation
of the protection mechanism involved and the study of the effect of
some external parameters such as the experimentation temperature and
the amount of the extract. The use of an additive such as iodide to
improve the inhibition efficiency was also scrutinized. The comparative
study of the alkaloid extract and the isolated compounds (tetrahydroalastonine
(THA) and perakine (PER)) in the extract is performed. For this to
be achieved, the alkaloid fraction was first extracted from the RMS
bark, and the corrosion inhibition parameters were obtained from electrochemical
measurements (polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
curves).

and H2SO4 Solution
2.1.1 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS curves (Nyquist and Bode
representations) of C38 steel in 1
M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 obtained in the absence
on one hand and presence on the other hand of AERMS at various concentrations
are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 EIS curves of C38 steel in the absence and presence of AERMS at
various concentrations. (a) Nyquist plots, (b) Bode modulus, and (c)
Bode phase angle plots in 1 M HCl. (d) Nyquist plots, (e) Bode modulus,
and (f) Bode phase angle plots in 0.5 M H2SO4.

The Nyquist plots in 1 M HCl and
0.5 M H2SO4 solutions with the AERMS (Figure 1a,d, respectively)
display the capacitive loop characteristic
of the corrosion process controlled by a charge transfer step on a
solid electrode with a heterogeneous and irregular surface. The diameters
of the capacitive half-loops of the Nyquist diagrams and the impedance
modulus (Figure 1b,e)
increased gradually with the AERMS concentration in the corrosive
solution. However, this increase is not proportional because as the
concentration doubles, the distance between the curves remains approximately
equal. The inductive loops at lower frequencies was attributed to
the relaxation processes due to ion adsorption (mainly Clads–, Hads+, and SO4 ads2–) on the electrode surface.13 The best
equivalent circuit that matches the experimental data of the Nyquist
plots is presented in the inset of Figure 1a for hydrochloric acid and Figure 1d for sulfuric acid, where Rs (the first intersection of the semicircle
with the Zr axis) represents the resistance
of the corrosive solution; Rct (the second
intersection of the semicircle with the Zr axis) is the charge transfer resistance, L is the
inductance, which is intimately associated with the inductive loop
at low frequencies, RL is the inductive
resistance, and A is the CPE (constant phase element)
constant that accounts for surface inhomogeneity. After the fitting
procedure, these electrochemical parameters are recorded in Table 1.

Low values of the goodness of fit (χ2) indicate
that the fitted data have good agreement with the experimental data.
The values of the charge transfer resistance increases with the amount
of the AERMS in solution, while the double layer capacitance (Cdl) decreases at the same time. The formation
of a protective layer (due to the reaction of alloy when in contact
with oxygen of the solution) by adsorption on the surface of the C38
steel electrode fully explains the trend of the values of Rct and Cdl obtained.
These molecules are probably associated to the corrosion products
to form a protective layer, which reduces the number of active corrosion
sites.8,15 The values of deviation from the ideal behavior
(n) did not vary significantly, therefore confirming
the charge transfer controlled mechanism of C38 steel without and
with inhibitor.16 The thickness of the
protective layer depends on the concentration of the inhibitor in
solution: for high AERMS concentrations, the rather higher thickness
was noticed, substantially increasing the charge resistance transfer
and thus the inhibition efficiency. The adsorbed layer also affects
the double layer capacitance (Cdl) at
the electrode/solution interface by replacing water molecules. The
best inhibition efficiency (97%) obtained in the hydrochloric acid
solution compared to sulfuric acid (93%) could be due to the beneficial
adsorption of chloride ions at the anode surface.10,26

2.1.2 Polarization Curves
The potentiodynamic
curves (logarithmic transformation) recorded in hydrochloric acid
and in sulfuric acid solutions in the absence and presence of AERMS
at various concentrations are presented in Figure 2.

A shift in corrosion potential is insignificant
and cannot be ascribe
to the act of the corrosion inhibitor. The cathodic branch (assigned
to the proton reduction) and the anodic branch (assigned to the oxidation
of iron) of the signal are well defined. In both acids, the current
densities recorded in the cathodic part of the curves decrease gradually
with the amount of the AERMS added, showing that the extract inhibits
the cathodic reaction associated to the corrosion process. A similar
observation was made on the anodic part of the curve recorded in HCl,
that is, a decrease in the iron oxidation current with AERMS concentration.33−35 In sulfuric acid, the decrease in the oxidation current densities
was not clearly observed. AERMS can thus be considered as a cathodic
inhibitor in sulfuric acid and a mixed inhibitor with predominant
cathodic effectiveness in HCl. The values of the anodic and cathodic
(βa and βc) slopes in both acids
are respectively modified with the addition of the inhibitor. These
observations suggest that inhibition is controlled by anodic and cathodic
reactions.15 One can also notice that at
high oxidation potentials (> −0.25 mV in HCl and > −0.35
mV in H2SO4), almost no variation of the oxidation
current densities was observed even when the extract was present in
the corrosive medium.27

As expected,
the corrosion current density greatly decreased as
the amount of AERMS in the solution grows from 234 to 16 μA
cm–2 in H2SO4 and from 381
to 30 μA cm–2 in HCl. Consecutively to these,
substantial diminishes of Jcorr and high
percentages of IE up to 90% were obtained for AERMS concentrations
higher than 100 mg/L. One particularly noticeable result was the high
efficiency of the inhibitor in HCl at lower concentrations (IE of
63% at 5 mg/L) compared to H2SO4 (18% at 5 mg/L).
This clearly showed that the counteranion of the acid was inactive
during the inhibition process.13,26 The corrosion potential
has no direct correlation with the composition of the corrosive solution
as it varies randomly.16

Ours results
clearly show that the activity of AERMS as an inhibitor
proceeds via a step of its adsorption at the surface of the steel
electrode, making the accessibility of the metal to protons more difficult.
The adsorption of the inhibitor at the surface of the steel electrode
was confirmed by FTIR analysis of the thin layer recovered at the
electrode surface after its immersion in a corrosive solution containing
AERMS for 3 h (Figure 3 and Table 3).

During this adsorption step, the water molecules and
other ionic
species previously adsorbed on the metal surface are replaced by the
inhibitor molecules. In order to assess the spatial distribution of
the inhibitor on the metal surface, the coverage (θ) was determined
at a given AERMS concentration, and these experimental data fitted
with a well-known linearized Langmuir model (eq 1)36,37 1  where K is
the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant, and Cinh (mg/L) is the concentration of the inhibitor. Figure 4 represents the results
obtained for HCl and H2SO4.

for C38 steel corrosion inhibition in
(a) 1 M HCl and (b) 0.5 M H2SO4 at different
AERMS concentrations.

The correlation coefficients (quite close to 1 (R2 > 0.99) both in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4) tend to show that the Langmuir adsorption isotherm
was suitable
to describe AERMS adsorption in a single layer on the C38 steel surface.15

2.1.3 Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy
(FESEM) Analysis
This surface analysis technique is used
to visualize very small topographic details on the surface and to
produce less electrostatically distorted images. Figure 5 shows the surface morphology
of C38 steel during FESEM analysis.

Figure 5 FESEM micrographs of C38 steel: (a) freshly
polished surface (b)
after 3 h immersion in 1 M HCl, (c) after 3 h immersion in 1 M HCl
with 100 mg/L AERMS, (d) after 3 h immersion in 0.5 M H2SO4, and (e) after 3 h immersion in 0.5 M H2SO4 with 100 mg/L AERMS.

FESEM micrograph observation of the surface obtained before
immersion
(Figure 5a) is smooth.
After immersion in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions
in the absence of the inhibitor, a highly damaged steel surface was
observed (Figure 5b,c)
with the presence of clusters of iron and punctures. This is due to
the oxidation of iron in the absence of the inhibitor. In the presence
of AERMS (Figure 5c–e),
the surface of steel exhibits an absence of rust. By comparing the
micrographs obtained after immersion in the two solutions without
inhibitor, we can conclude that the surface of steel in the presence
of AERMS is almost free of corrosion. These observations can be explained
by the formation of a film made up of alkaloid molecules on the steel
surface preventing the access of aggressive agents.1,6,13,15

2.2 Effect of Temperature
Corrosion inhibitors
are used in various environments submitted to noticeable temperature
variations. The corrosion mechanism being essentially a surface phenomenon
should then be very sensitive to temperature variations.

2.2.1 Polarization Curves
The polarization
curves recorded at 30, 40, 50, and 60 °C in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M
H2SO4 solutions without and with the optimal
concentration of AERMS (100 mg/L) are presented in Figure 6. The electrochemical parameters
and the inhibition efficiencies derived from these curves are recorded
in Tables 4 and 5.

As expected, the temperature increases with
the current densities
in the absence of the corrosion inhibitor. The corrosion current densities
(Jcorr) follow the same trend, confirming
the harmful effect of the temperature increase in the corrosion of
C38 steel. This tendency is preserved even in the presence of the
inhibitor (100 mg/L). However, in HCl + 100 mg/L AERMS, it is mainly
the anodic branch that was strongly affected by the temperature increase,
whereas it was the cathodic branch in the case of H2SO4. These results clearly suggest that the mechanism of action
of the extract as the corrosion inhibitor of C38 steel is different
in the two acid solutions. The decrease in inhibition efficiency in
0.5 M H2SO4 when the temperature was increased
suggests the physical adsorption of the inhibitor molecules.15

2.2.2 Thermodynamic Activation
Parameters
In order to further the elucidation of these corrosion
phenomena,
the activation energy and thermodynamic parameters associated to the
adsorption of AERMS on the C38 steel surface were determined. This
was achieved using current densities obtained from the extrapolation
of plots at different temperatures. The activation energy derived
from the Arrhenius equation (eq 2)(38) was obtained by plotting the
logarithm of the experimental corrosion current density versus (1/T) (Figure 7). 2  where K is
the Arrhenius pre-exponential constant, Ea (J/mol) is the activation energy, T (K) is the
temperature, and R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) is the
gas constant.

Figure 7 Arrhenius plots of (a) ln Jcorr vs
1/T and (c) ln(Jcorr/T) vs 1/T in 1 M HCl and (b) ln Jcorr vs 1/T and (d) ln(Jcorr/T) vs 1/T in 0.5 M H2SO4 in the temperature range of
30–60 °C and in the absence and presence of 100 mg/L AERMS.

The activation energy (Ea) values calculated
from the slopes of the straight lines in the absence and presence
of AERMS are listed in Table 6.

Table 6 Thermodynamic Activation Parameters
of C38 Steel in 1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 without
and with 100 mg/L AERMS
solution	Ea (kJ mol–1)	ΔHa (kJ mol–1)	ΔSa (J mol–1 K–1)	
1 M HCl	70.33	72.83	–70.80	
1 M HCl + 100 mg/L AERMS	73.83	71.08	–96.61	
0.5 M H2SO4	74.58	71.83	–77.60	
0.5 M H2SO4 + 100 mg/L AERMS	113.74	111.24	32.11	
It is clear that the addition of 100 mg/L AERMS increases
the apparent
activated energy from 74.58 to 113.74 kJ/mol in 0.5 M H2SO4 and from 70.33 to 73.83 kJ/mol in 1 M HCl. This behavior
suggests that AERMS inhibits the corrosion reaction by increasing
its activation energy. This could be done by adsorption of the molecule
inhibitor on the C38 steel surface, making a barrier to the mass and
charge transfer.39

Some other useful
thermodynamic parameters such as the standard
enthalpy of activation (ΔHa) and
standard entropy of activation (ΔSa) can be derived from the Arrhenius equation (eq 3) put in a different form: 3  where h (6.626
068 × 10–34 J s) is the Planck constant, and N (6.022 × 1023 mol–1)
is the Avogadro’s number. By plotting ln(Jcorr/T) = f(1/T) (Figure 7c,d), ΔHa and ΔSa were determined (Table 6).

The positive values of ΔHa both
in the absence and presence of AERMS confirm the endothermic nature
of C38 steel dissolution in acid media.15,31,40 By contrast, in the same condition, the values of
ΔSa are negative. However, ΔSa is lower in the presence of the extract, confirming
the higher stability of the protective layer when AERMS was added
in HCl solution. Indeed, in the presence of the inhibitor, the Fe–inhibitor
complex is formed in the place of Fe–H2O. The decrease
in the entropy upon inhibitor addition implies that the protecting
layer is more ordered in the presence of the inhibitor.1

The strong increase in the value of ΔSa in 0.5 M H2SO4 with
the addition of
alkaloid extract (32.11 kJ/mol) indicates that the activated complex
is more disordered in the presence of the inhibitor.31 The effect of the anion (Cl– or I–) is very crucial on the overall adsorption process.

2.3 Effect of Iodide on the Efficiency of AERMS
on the Corrosion Inhibition of C38 Steel
In order to improve
the adsorption of AERMS on the steel surface in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium, the halide ions may be used. Iodide is well
known for its ability to enhance the efficiency of alkaloid extracts
as corrosion inhibitors.41,42 The large size of this
highly polarizable anion seems to be the factor responsible for this
exceptional efficiency.43 The effect of
the concentration of this anion on the efficiency of AERMS was investigated.
The study was conducted exclusively in sulfuric acid because of the
lower adsorption of the extract in this acid compared to HCl. Nyquist
plots and polarization curves for C38 steel are presented in Figure 8, and corresponding
data are given in Tables 7 and 8.

Figure 8a compares
the Nyquist plots of the effect of 1 mM iodide on the corrosion of
C38 steel in H2SO4 without or with AERMS.

The curve obtained in the presence of the extract without iodide
is also plotted as a reference. The IE determined from Rct and Jcorr reported in Tables 7 and 8 shows that 1 mM iodide offers poor protection of steel against
corrosion (IE of 61%). When iodide is associated to AERMS, a net decrease
in current densities was observed, and IE moves from 90% without KI
to 96% in the presence of the anion. These results clearly demonstrate
that iodide improves the ability of the extract to protect the metal
against the corrosive environment of the acidic solution. As a matter
of fact, the IE is equivalent to the value obtained in HCl using identical
AERMS concentrations.

The large size and the important polarizability
of iodide facilitate
the bonding of the anion at the metal surface through chemisorption.
This is followed by the adsorption of protonated alkaloids present
in AERMS on the first layer of adsorbed halide ions.15,44 AERMS adsorption was more homogeneous as it was directed by the
first layer of well-adsorbed iodide. This results to a more uniform
metal surface coverage and thus good protection. Potentiodynamic analysis
(Figure 8b) shows that,
in the presence of 1 mM iodide alone in the acidic solution, anodic
protection was displayed. Associated to the extract, a mixed-type
inhibitor was obtained as both cathodic and anodic protection was
obtained. These results confirm once again the synergetic effect of
KI toward the corrosion inhibition of C38 steel when added to the
alkaloid extract. The corrosion parameters (Jcorr and Ecorr) extracted from
these curves confirmed this interpretation (Table 8).

2.4 Isolation of THA and PER
and Study of Their
Inhibition Efficiency
2.4.1 Isolation of THA and
PER
AERMS
contains several alkaloids that can act as corrosion inhibitors. The
effect observed with AERMS is certainly the result of the complementary
action of the efficient compounds present in the extract. Only two
compounds (THA and PER) were quantitatively isolated from AERMS and
analyzed using high-resolution 13C and 1H NMR.
Following the interpretation of these 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift spectra (see Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2), the chemical structures of
PER and THA were elucidated (Figure 9). These structures correspond to some compounds recently
isolated in the extract of Rauvolfia tetraphylla and Rauvolfia serpentina, respectively.45,46

Figure 9 Structure
of isolated molecules: (a) perakine and (b) tetrahydroalastonine.

Examining the structure of these
two indole alkaloids reveals that
their adsorption on the metal surface can proceed via the free doublets
of basic nitrogen, oxygen atoms, and aromatic rings.

2.4.2 Corrosion Inhibition of C38 Steel in 1 M
HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 by THA and PER
The corrosion inhibition of THA and PER on C38 steel in 1 M HCl and
0.5 M H2SO4 was evaluated and compared to the
result obtained with the extract (AERMS). A concentration of 10 mg/L
was chosen to compare the efficiencies of the inhibitors in the active
domain of the process. Indeed, results obtained with AERMS showed
that at a concentration of 10 mg/L, the inhibition efficiency was
higher than 60%. The polarization curves and Nyquist plots obtained
with AERMS, PER, and THA in HCl and H2SO4 are
presented in Figure 10. The constants derived from these plots are summarized in Table S3.

Figure 10 Comparison of the polarization curves
and Nyquist diagrams for
C38 steel in (a, c) 1 M HCl and (b, d) 0.5 M H2SO4 in the absence and presence of different inhibitors (10 mg/L).

The addition of inhibitors decreases
the corrosion current density.
However, the cathodic curves are more shifted toward the lower current
density, especially in HCl, with THA as the most efficient inhibitor.
The Nyquist plots were more effective to distinguish the efficiencies
of the three inhibitors. Indeed, the differences are well highlighted
on the curves depicted in Figure 10c,d. Based on the Rct values,
THA was confirmed as the most efficient inhibitor followed by AERMS.
Surprisingly, AERMS is more efficient than PER, especially in H2SO4. The poor efficiency of PER compared to THA
may be due to the more pronounced steric hindrance of the basic nitrogen
atom.15 This result confirms once again
the decisive role played by the availability of the structural basic
nitrogen atom on the corrosion inhibition. On the other hand, one
can conclude that the constituents of the extract act concomitantly
in AERMS; the more powerful compensating the less efficient.

3 Conclusions
This study puts a major emphasis
on the three points: the investigation
of the inhibitory properties of AERMS, the improvement of the adsorption
of AERMS in H2SO4 medium by KI, and the comparative
study of the inhibitory activity of AERMS and the two isolated compounds.
Several interesting points can be highlighted from the obtained results.
AERMS strongly adsorbs on the steel surface and thus prevents its
corrosion. These surface phenomenon were confirmed by analyses of
the metal surface before and after corrosion experiments (FESEM and
FTIR). The inhibition of AERMS was improved in the presence of iodide
in corrosive solution where it acts as a mixed inhibitor, with the
efficiency increasing from 90 to 96% in H2SO4 medium. The experiment with the two isolated compounds of the extract
(PER and THA) confirmed the important role played by the basic nitrogen
atom in the process and the variable efficiencies of compounds present
in the alkaloid extract. More investigations are still needed to determine
whether the action of the compounds is synergetic or just the superimposition
of the individual effect.

4 Materials and Experimental
Methods
4.1 Materials and Solutions
Corrosion
tests were performed on a cylindrical C38 steel sample from Tacinas
Company (France). Its chemical composition (wt %) was 0.360 C, 0.230
Si, 0.680 Mn, 0.016 S, 0.077 Cr, 0.011 Ti, 0.059 Ni, 0.009 Co, 0,160
Cu, and 98.388 Fe according to the French standard. The C38 steel
surface was coated in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) ribbon, leaving
a free circular basal working surface of 0.785 cm2. To
obtain reproducible results, the working electrode was polished with
silicon carbide abrasive papers of different grades (100, 1200, 2500,
and 4000) from the most abrasive to the least abrasive. Corrosive
solutions (1 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4) were prepared
from commercial solutions of 37% HCl (Scharlau) and 98% H2SO4 (Scharlau) and distilled water.

4.2 Extraction of Total Alkaloids from Rauvolfia
macrophylla Stapf Bark
RMS barks
was harvested at the So’o locality, of Nyong and So’o
division, in the center region of Cameroon. The samples were cut into
tiny pieces, air dried for 15 days, and finely grounded. The resulting
powder was macerated at room temperature for 3 days in a dichloromethane/methanol
(1:1) mixture. The crude extract was obtained by evaporating the solvent,
and the total alkaloid extract was obtained following Pandian’s
procedure.3 The Dragendorff’s test
confirmed the high content of alkaloids in the extract.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical experiments were performed in a thermostated electrochemical
cell with three electrodes: the working electrode was the C38 steel
rod, the auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire, and the reference
electrode was a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). These electrodes
were connected to an Autolab PGSTAT 12 (EcoChemie) potentiostat/galvanostat
controlled by the software FRA (Frequency Response Analysis) for electrochemical
impedance measurements, and GPES (General Purpose Electrochemical
System) for the open circuit and potentiodynamic polarization experiments.

Before recording the polarization and EIS curves, the working electrode
was first immersed in the test solution (acidic solution with or without
AERMS) for 3 hours (experimental optimum immersion time required to
reach constant potential at a steady-state open circuit).

The
polarization curves were recorded by scanning the potential
from −800 to −200 mV/SCE at a scan rate of 0.5 mV/s.
The inhibitory efficiency (IE) was calculated using eq 4 4  where Jcorr (A cm–2) and Jcorr(inh) (A cm–2) are the
corrosion current
density in the absence and presence of the inhibitor, respectively.

A voltage amplitude of 10 mV around the open-circuit corrosion
potential and a frequency range of 10 kHz to 100 mHz were used for
the EIS measurements. The inhibition efficiencies were determined
using eq 5 5  where Rct (Ω
cm2) and Rct(inh) (Ω
cm2) are the charge transfer resistance in the
absence and presence of the inhibitor, respectively.

The capacity
of double layer was determined using eq 6 6  where ωmax = 2πfmax, and fmax (Hz) is the frequency corresponding
to the maximum
value of the imaginary component of the Nyquist curve. Following the
model of Helmholtz,33,47,48 we have 7  where εo is
the dielectric constant of the adsorbed water, and ε is the
permittivity constant and the thickness of the layer formed.

The study of the influence of the concentration of AERMS was performed
in 1 M HCl or 0.5 M H2SO4, while the influence
of the temperature was achieved by varying the temperature of the
electrolytic solution at the optimum AERMS concentration.

4.4 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
recording of the FTIR spectra of the deposits on the electrode
surface after immersion in the corrosive solutions proceeded as follows:
the electrode previously polished was immersed for 3 h in the acidic
solution in the presence of (or without) the corrosion inhibitor,
and the electrode was then removed from the solution and dried for
1 h in open air. The passive layer was then gently removed with a
spatula, and the resulted powder used for the preparation of the KBr
pellets used for the recording of the FTIR spectra.

4.5 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FESEM) Analysis
FESEM analysis was used to investigate the
surface morphology of C38 steel after immersion in 1 M HCl and 0.5
M H2SO4 solutions in the absence and presence
of AERMS at the optimum concentration for 3 h. FESEM analysis was
performed with a Sopra 55 VP field emission scanning microscope.
