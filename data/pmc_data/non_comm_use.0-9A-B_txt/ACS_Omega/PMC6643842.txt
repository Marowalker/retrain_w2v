An electrochemical biosensor for
the detection of cardiac troponin
I, cTnI, an important cardiac biomarker, is described. A combination
of a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb20B3, and a novel Ir(III)-based
metal complex was used for detection using faradaic electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy. A limit of detection of 10 ag/mL was achieved,
which is significantly lower than established assays. The ability
to detect these ultralow concentrations enables rapid and early stage
detection of cardiac events and opens up the possibility of developing
a point-of-care device.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease
(CVD) is one of the most prevalent causes
of human death in both developing and developed countries.1 The World Health Organization estimates that
on an average, 30% of all global deaths are associated with CVD, and
it may be one of the leading causes of death in developing countries.2,3 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading type of CVD and
occurs when part of the heart muscle is damaged following blockage
of a coronary artery. AMI management and its rapid diagnosis, for
example, through a molecular biomarker, are required4 is extremely time-sensitive. Several biomarkers have been
explored for the detection of AMI, for example, creatine kinase MB
(CK-MB), myoglobin, and cardiac troponin (cTn).5 The latter is recommended as a biomarker of choice for
acute coronary syndrome. cTn exists as a complex between three single-chain
polypeptides: troponin T (cTnT)
binds the other troponin components to tropomyosin, troponin
I (cTnI) inhibits ATP activity when bound
to actin, and troponin C (cTnC)
contains binding sites for calcium. In general, upon AMI, the troponin
complex becomes fragmented, and the individual protein components
are then released into the bloodstream. Among the three types of troponins,
cTnI (molecular weight 23 876 Da) is preferred for detection
because of its superior cardiac specificity and selectivity.6 The concentration of cTnI increases within 2–6
h upon the onset of AMI and reaches a maximum concentration of the
order of 50 ng/mL during the next 24 h.7

Accurate and rapid determination of cTnI is very important
for
early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of AMI. Typically, within
2–12 h upon the onset of AMI, cTnI levels rise in the serum
and remain elevated for 5–10 days.8 Because of the crucial need for early diagnosis, cTnI testing should
be performed within 3–4 h after the suspected onset of AMI.
To date, several techniques have been reported for cTnI detection
including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,9,10 use
of optomagnetism,11 field-effect transistor-based
analysis,12 fluorescence immunoassay,13 and electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based biosensors.14−17 The development of electrochemical immunosensors based on electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS)18−21 can provide direct sensitive and selective detection
and is suitable for developing a point-of-care device.22 Limits of detection (LOD) in the nanometer–picometer
range under controlled laboratory conditions have been reported for
impedance-based biosensors.23−28 In particular, recent studies have reported on significant LOD detection
of cTnI using EIS3 (Table 1) and their promising application as early
detection and management of CVD.

In this contribution, a novel
monoclonal antibody (*mAb), mAb20B3,
specific to epitope 24–39 region of troponin I (cTnI) was investigated
as either the primary (capture) or, when labeled with a novel iridium
metal complex, as secondary (detection) antibody in sandwich assays
on a gold disk electrode. Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, because
of their easily modifiable optical, photophysical, and electrochemical
properties, are increasingly being applied in biological applications.29−33 Compared to traditionally studied complexes such as Ru(bpy)32+, cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes have higher
photoluminescence efficiency and easy tunability of the emission wavelength,
which is extremely useful for multiplexed detection of several biomarkers
without separation.34 Additionally, iridium(III)
complexes have presented the ability to hinder electron transfer between
the electrode surface and the electrolyte because of the hydrophobicity
and the large molecular structure of the complex.33 As a result of these multiple properties, Ir(III) complexes
have recently been successfully applied as electrochemical enhancement
probes for biological sensor.32,33

Moreover, this
sensor, compared to those reported previously for
cardiac biomarker detection,14−17 replaces the conventional Ru(bpy)32+ by using a brighter Ir(II) metal complex, presents higher
sensitivity, and permits fast, reliable, and inexpensive detection
of lower quantities of antigen, which is supported by confocal microscopy.
In this work, the investigation of Ir(III)-labeled antibodies and
their ability to enhance the detection of cTn by EIS and confocal
microscopy, has, to our knowledge, not yet been reported.

Scheme 1 illustrates
the detection strategy. The electrode, modified with the capture antibody,
was incubated with various concentrations of troponin I in the range
of 1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL. A secondary antibody specific to a different
epitope region (epitope region 41–49) of cTnI, labeled with
a redox-active cyclometalated Ir(III) complex, was then attached and
the faradic impedance was measured. Currently, LOD for cTnI assays
are in the 80–100 fg/mL range using electrochemical methods,
for example, ECL biosensors,10 which compare
favorably with other analytical methods.6−9 The approach reported here is expected to
have significant applications for the detection of low levels of cTnI
(ag/mL) as a promising, rapid, and precise alternative to current
time-consuming, conventional methods. The superior analytical performance
could allow cTnI to be rapidly detected in the early stage of AMI.

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical Impedance
Studies
EIS detection provides
an extremely rapid, simple, and sensitive method for biological samples.
Detecting cTnI before and after any AMI symptoms is a vital component
of routine heart checkups. Therefore, there is a significant drive
to develop an easy, highly accurate, and robust label-free EIS detection
method for trace cTnI before and after AMI symptoms in addition to therapeutic monitoring of the disease.
Normally, protein quantifications in a biofluid are detected in EIS
measurements using a redox probe in solution whose heterogeneous electron-transfer
rate constant39,40 is dependent on antibody–antigen
binding. External redox probes, for example, ferricyanide, used during
the impedance measurements may change the biological system, leading
to a decreased sensitivity.41 However,
if the redox probe is attached to the detection probe surface (i.e.,
secondary antibody) instead of being a redox-active electrochemical
probe in solution, the antibody–cTnI binding events can be
detected in a dilute Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered solution
(DPBS). Thus, a suitable nontoxic redox probe can potentially be covalently
attached to the secondary antibody.

In this study, a dilute
electrolyte, 0.001 M DPBS, was utilized for EIS so that the double-layer
thickness was comparable to the thickness of the antibody–target–secondary
antibody/Ir–COOH layer, thus making the measurement sensitive
to changes occurring within that film.20,41−43 Changes in the EIS spectra can be related to the change in resistance
and capacitance of the interface, thus providing insights into the
effects of both surface modification and analyte binding.44 In particular, this dilute concentration of
electrolyte ensures that both cell resistance (intersection of the
right-hand side of the Nyquist semicircle with the x-axis) and capacitances depend strongly on cTnI concentration (surface
coverage).

Novel mAb20B3 as the Primary Capture Antibody
Step
1
Modification of gold surface was monitored using
EIS (Supporting Information, Figure S4).
The EIS data were analyzed by Nyquist plots. Nyquist plots show the
frequency response of the electrode/electrolyte system and plot the
imaginary component (Z″) of the impedance
against the real component (Z′). The interfacial
resistance (Rct) at the electrode surface
is given by the semicircle diameter obtained in EIS.45 In the present study, non-faradaic electrochemical impedance
study measurements were first carried out to characterize the formation
of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid
(16-MHDA) and attachment of the in-house mAb20B3 antibody (specific
to troponin epitope region 24–39) onto a gold disk electrode.
A clear semicircle was observed for the bare gold electrode, and the Rct value was determined to be about 248 ±
116 Ω (Supporting Information, Figure
S2) for 60 independent electrodes. The Rct value increased to 2064 ± 64 Ω for the electrode modified
with 16-MHDA. After the immobilization of mAb20B3 (100 μg/mL)
on the Au/MHDA electrode, the average Rct value of 30 electrodes further increased to 4019 ± 89 Ω.
The increased Rct arises from hindered
ion transport, indicating successful immobilization of the mAbs.19 The properties of a commercial mAb (Hytest mAb228)
with a similar epitope (epitope region 26–35) were also measured.
In comparison to the novel monoclonal mAb (4019 ± 89 Ω),
the commercially available mAbs (Hytest 228) exhibited an average
(n = 30) Rct value of
3151 ± 569 Ω (Supporting Information, Figure S5). This lower resistance suggests a more porous antibody
layer.

Step 2: Impedance Characteristics of the cTnI Immunosensor
The change in interfacial resistance was monitored as the cTnI
concentration varied systematically from 1 ng/mL to 1 ag/mL (n = 3) (Supporting Information, Figure S6). EIS responses were recorded in the presence of 1 mM
DPBS using an amplitude of 25 mV and the direct current (dc) potential
set to the open-circuit potential (OCP). The frequency range was between
0.01 and 100 000 Hz. To ensure that the double-layer thickness
was comparable to the thickness of the antibody–target–secondary
antibody layer, the electrolyte used was 1 mM. This ensured that the
measurement was sensitive to changes occurring within that film itself.29

As demonstrated in Figures 1A● and S6 (Supporting Information), the interfacial resistance increased with increasing
cTnI concentration, reflecting the binding of cTnI to the capture
antibody (20B3) immobilized on the electrode. The best fit least-squares
regression line is y = 925 ± 94x + 20 308 ± 1147, indicating a high sensitivity and a
low nonspecific background current and the relative standard deviation
(RSD) was in between 3 and 5% (n = 3) for all cTnI
concentration levels. LOD defined as (3σ/slope) was determined
to be 100 ag/mL. This range encompasses the clinically relevant range
(usually up to 0.06–1.5 ng/mL in clinics). The sensitivity
of the assay using the custom-synthesized mAb20B3 antibody, defined
as the slope of calibration curve, is approximately 1.2 times higher
than that found using a commercial antibody (Hytest 228, Figure 1A, ■) with
a similar epitope. In addition, the commercial mAb-based immunosensor
showed a higher LOD (10 fg/mL) than that obtained for the custom-generated
mAb (100 ag/mL). These results most likely reflect a higher association
constant for the custom antibody with the cTnI target. The wide dynamic
range, approximately 9 orders of magnitude, low LOD, and excellent
sensitivity make the assay based on the custom antibody attractive
for the development of a label-free, point-of-care cardiac diagnostic
device. However, labeled antibody approaches can deliver even greater
sensitivity without adding significant complexity to the measurement.

Figure 1 (A) Dependence
of interfacial resistance (n =
3) on cTnI concentration where the primary antibodies are mAb20B3 (●) and mAb228 (■),
following exposure to increasing cTnI target (1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL)
and after immobilization of the Ir (III)-labeled commercial secondary
antibody mAb19C7 (B). In all cases, the supporting
electrolyte is 1 mM DPBS and EIS was recorded between 0.01 and 100 000
Hz using an alternating current (ac) amplitude of 25 mV and the dc
potential set to the OCP.

Step 3: Novel Ir(III) Secondary Antibody
After the
capture of cTnI target, a secondary antibody (Hytest 19C7, specific
to epitope region 41–49) labeled with the Ir–COOH complex
(Figure 1B) was bound
to the primary antibody–target complex. The conformational
changes associated with target binding a hydrophobic complex such
as Ir–COOH brings the redox reporter into close proximity to
the electrode, yielding a change in the interfacial properties and
therefore disturbing the electrochemical reaction and a more resistive
behavior (higher impedance) can be expected.46,47 Subsequently, the interaction of iridium complex with increasing
concentrations of cTnI leads to a remarkable increased electron-transfer
resistance (Figure 1B, ●). The high resistance of the electrode interface is induced
by the adsorption of the iridium complex and the formation of a hydrophobic
layer on the electrode surface. The target molecules show a good linear
relationship between impedance and concentration of cTnI ranging from
1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL with an R2 value of
0.9955. A 2-fold increase in the calibration slope was observed after
the conjugation of Ir–COOH (1697.6 Ω, Figure 1B, ●) compared to the
antibody–cTnI-modified electrode (925.78 Ω, Figure 1A, ●), indicating
a high sensitivity of the assay. The observation that the corresponding
was observed after the conjugation of Ir–COOH (1697.6 Ω, Figure 1B, ●) compared
to the antibody–cTnI-modified electrode (925.78 Ω, Figure 1A, ●) indicating
a high sensitivity of the assay. The corresponding resistance
increases with Ir–COOH, demonstrating successful binding to
the modified electrode. The observation that resistance increases
linearly with log[cTnI] rather than [cTnI] suggests that the current
response is influenced by the successful binding of Ir–COOH
to the modified electrode as well as the cTnI concentration. To directly
confirm that the Ir(III)-labeled secondary antibody is indeed bound
to cTnI, luminescence microscopy was carried out (Figure 2). Similar to the results of
electrochemistry studies, the fluorescence on the gold surface only
changes when the electrode is incubated with Ir–COOH. In comparison
to the sensor in the absence of Ir–COOH, the LOD further decreased
from 100 to 10 ag/mL. The LOD of this sensor has proven to be lower
than that achieved by a commercially available electrochemical sensor
from Abbott, i-STAT, that can detect cTnI at levels 80 ng mL–1.48 Once more, the sensitivity of the
assay using the custom-synthesized mAb20B3 primary antibody was compared
to a commercial antibody (Hytest 228) with a similar epitope, after
the incubation of cTnI and Ir(III)-labeled secondary antibody. Significantly,
as shown in Figure 1B ■, the sensitivity of the assay using commercial antibodies
was approximately 34% lower with an LOD of 1 fg/mL.

Figure 2 Confocal images of an
electrode modified with 16-MHDA and the in-house-generated
mAb20B3 (A) and a commercially available Hytest mAb228 primary antibody
(B), following exposure to the cTnI target (1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL) and
the Ir(III)-labeled commercial secondary antibody (mAb19C7). Luminescence
images were recorded live on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope
using a 40× oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.4) and a 488 nm
argon ion laser applied for iridium-labeled antibody imaging. Scale
bar 20 μm.

In conclusion, these
data suggest that mAb20B3 utilized as a primary
antibody demonstrates extremely high affinity for cTnI. The capture
efficiency of the in-house-generated mAbs has enhanced the overall
sensitivity of the impedimetric response because of a greater quantity
of cTnI immobilized on the electrode surface for each given target
concentration.

Confocal Characteristics of the cTnI Immunosensor
To
evaluate the troponin (cTnI) surface coverage and labeling efficiency
of Ir–COOH–mAb, confocal luminescence microscopy was
employed. The extent of nonspecific binding of antibodies to 16-MHDA
was investigated, that is, when the capture antibody and cTnI target
are absent. The 16-MHDA layer was exposed to Ir–COOH–mAb
(100 μg/mL stock concentration) for 1 h at 37 °C. For all
three antibodies, negligible fluorescence is observed following exposure
to the labeled antibody, suggesting that nonspecific binding is not
a significant issue for these capture surfaces (Supporting Information, Figure S7).

Figure 2 shows the representative confocal
luminescence images of the in-house-generated mAb-20B3 (A) and commercially
available mAb228 (B)-modified electrodes after exposure to suspensions
of cTnI at concentrations ranging from 1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL, followed
by exposure to the Ir-labeled secondary antibody mAb19C7 for 1 h at
37 °C. For both antibodies, the emission intensity increases
with increasing troponin concentration for both the 20B3mAb- and 228mAb-functionalized
electrode surface. Significantly, the fluorescence intensity for 1
ng cTnI with the Ir–mAb19C7 antibody was 30% higher for mAb20B3
capture antibody compared to the Hytest mAb228 one. This enhanced
emission at low concentrations is potentially useful for the early
detection of cTnI.

mAb20B3 as the Secondary (Detection) Antibody
Impedance
Measurements for the Modification of Gold Electrodes
with mAb-19C7 as the Capturing Antibody
Commercially available
cTnI assays are highly cardiac specific and typically target the N-terminal
region (amino acids 41–49). In accordance with commercial tests,
the performance of the assay was carried out using Hytest mAb19C7
(epitope region 41–49) as the primary antibody. Non-faradaic
electrochemical impedance study measurements were carried out to characterize
the 16-MHDA SAM-conjugated mAb19C7 gold electrode. As previously demonstrated,
a clear semicircle was observed for the bare gold electrode with an
average Rct value of 248 ± 116 Ω
(Supporting Information, Figure S8) for
the average of 30 independent electrodes. The Rct value further increased to 2064 ± 64 Ω for the
16-MHDA SAM-modified electrode. The covalent attachment of Hytest
mAb19C7 (100 μg/mL) on the electrode surface introduces a barrier
to the interfacial charge transfer, which is clearly indicated by
the significant increase of Rct of the
electrode to the value 5670 ± 118 Ω. Hytest 19C7 is an
immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2b) antibody and has unique biological properties
compared to mAb20B3/mAb228 (IgG1). IgG1 is thought to have a more
open and flexible (leaky) conformation than the more compact and rigid
IgG2b as it only has two disulfide bonds in its hinge region (four
in IgG2b).49 The highly packed nature of
the parent antibodies, Hytest 19C7, was largely reflected in the Nyquist
plot, suggesting that structural differences in the CH1 domain (nonleaky)
are responsible for the 41% increased resistance observed (Rct = 5670 ± 118 Ω) when compared
to mAb20B3 (4019 ± 89 Ω).50

Impedance Characteristics of the cTnI Immunosensor with N Terminal
Targeted Primary Antibody
Impedance studies focusing on the
detection and quantification of cTnI protein-19C7 were performed on
planar gold disk electrodes. The calibration profiles of complex plane
Nyquist plot (−Z″ vs Z′ where Z″ is the imaginary impedance
and Z′ the real impedance) and admittance
plot (−Y″ vs Y′
where Y″ represents the imaginary part of
admittance and Y′ the real part) are given
in Figure 3A,B, respectively.
Concentration-dependent impedance measurements are calculated based
on the theory of charge generation and transportation at the electrode
interface.20 This is due to the fact that
proteins in solution act as polyelectrolytes and hence its electrical
charge will be affected upon binding.51 It is apparent that the Z′ component and
the Z″ component of impedance, Figure 3A, both increase with increasing
frequency from the baseline/antibody trace. This figure shows that
antibody and cTnI binding (both proteins) promoted a substantial increase
in the barrier to charge transfer at the MHDA/gold surface. In the
admittance plane (Figure 3B), the frequency decreases from right to left as the concentration
of cTnI increases. The semicircle is due to the double-layer capacitance
and solution resistance of the antibody–cTnI hybridization.
In addition, to calculate the calibration equation, the plot of Rct vs the concentration of cTnI was illustrated
(Figure 4A,◊).
Two linear segments were observed; one in the concentration range
of 1 ag/mL to 100 fg/mL and the other in 1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL, y = 527.6x + 16016 and y = 4543.6x + 63838, respectively. Each data point
attained is an average value of three replicate measurements. The
variances observed for the calculated slopes for the calibration segments
were due to different activities of the sensor surface in low- and
high-concentration solutions of the analyte.52 For the higher concentrations (between 1 pg/mL and 1 ng/mL), the
increasing Rct indicates a rapid increase
of troponin immobilized onto the modified sensor surface and therefore
hindered charge transfer. Similar to the label-free sensor modified
with mAb20B3_cTnI (Figure 1A, ●), the LOD of mAb19C7_cTnI was determined to be
100 ag/mL, which was based on the standard deviation of the blank
noise (95% confidence level, n = 3).

Figure 3 Nyquist (A) and admittance
(B) plots of anti-cTnI (mAb19C7, epitope
region 41–49) bound to modified gold electrodes with the concentration
of cTnI systematically varied from 1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL (N = 3). The EIS spectra were recorded in the presence of 1 mM DPBS
using an amplitude of 25 mV and the dc potential set to the OCP. The
frequency range was between 0.01 and 100 000 Hz.

(■) secondary antibody. (C) Linear regression plots of four
sandwich immunoassays with in-house-generated and commercially available
antibodies, following exposure to the cTnI target (1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL)
and Ir(III)-labeled secondary antibody. In all cases, the supporting
electrolyte is 1 mM DPBS and EIS was recorded between 0.01 and 100 000
Hz using an ac amplitude of 25 mV and the dc potential set to the
OCP (N = 3).

Impedance Characteristics of cTnI Using Ir(III)-Labeled mAb
20B3 Secondary Antibody
Using the iridium-labeled secondary
antibody results in a resistance that (Figure 4A, ●) is approximately 6 times larger
than that found in the label-free assay. In the presence of Ir–mAb20B3,
a linear range from 1 ng/mL to 1 ag/mL was obtained for cTnI detection,
with a detection limit of 10 ag (3σ/slope). The best fit linear
regression equation was y = 3157.3 ± 185.7x + 63024 ± 3724.8 (R2 =
0.9906) and RSD was in between 1 and 13% (n = 3)
for all cTnI concentration levels. LOD is less than 0.1 ng/mL, which
could provide a useful insight into the onset of AMI. The performance
of this sensor was compared with the one having Ir–COOH–mAb228
as secondary antibody. Similar to the in-house-generated antibody,
the linear range spans from 1 ag to 1 ng/mL with an LOD of 10 ag/mL
(Figure 4B, ■).
However, there was a 28% decrease in sensitivity when compared to
the Ir–COOH–mAb20B3 sandwich assay (Figure 4B, ●), indicating that
less Ag–Ab interactions took place and the affinity of mAb228
is less for cTnI than our in-house-generated mAb-20B3. Similarly,
confocal microscopy was used to better indication of the density and
distribution of Ir–COOH in the sample for different analyte
concentrations. Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting Information show the confocal images for the mAb19C7_cTnI (1
ag/mL to 1 ng/mL)-modified electrodes following labeling with Ir–mAb20B3
(Supporting Information S9) and Ir–mAb228
(Supporting Information S10) for 1 h at
37 °C. For both studies, it can be clearly seen that a very large
percentage of active binding sites is occupied by iridium and the
images show the cumulative fluorescent intensity of Ir–COOH
after the incubation of increasing concentrations of captured troponin
for both the mAb20B3- and mAb228-functionalized electrode surface.

In the present study, we have compared two groups of mAbs specific
to human cTnI. The novel mAb, 20B3, was benchmarked against leading
commercial antibodies and in a two-site immunoassay for cTnI. A comparison
of all four immunoassays carried out is shown in Figure 4C with alternating primary
and secondary mAb combinations (Supporting Information, Scheme S1). It can be clearly seen that the combination of N-terminal
specific antibodies for the capturing of cTnI with our novel mAb labeled
with Ir(III) gave a very low LOD of 10 ag. The improved diagnostic
sensitivity of this assay could significantly affect the number of
AMI diagnoses and thereby crucial for decision making about appropriate
therapy.

Conclusions
To conclude, this study
highlights a proof-of-concept example for
a novel, robust, and extremely sensitive electrochemical immunoassay
for the detection of troponin I, which is a biomarker for myocardial
infarction. We have combined mAb technology with EIS to produce a
high-performance assay for the determination of the cardiac biomarker.
Significantly, an Ir(III) complex was employed as a label for the
detection antibody, producing a sensor capable of giving an enhanced
impedance response that can be readily detected. LOD resulted 10 ag/mL,
which to our knowledge is the first reported bioassay capable of detecting
cTnI at these detection levels. Specifically, we tested an in-house
antibody (mAb20B3) against a similar commercially available antibody
with the same epitope target region (mAb228), observing its superiority
in selectivity and sensitivity in capturing and detecting. This work
opens the possibility for a broader application of mAb engineering
across other biologically relevant biomarkers, and we are currently
pursuing this opportunity. By combining mAb engineering with low background
detection techniques such as EIS, there exists significant potential
for the development of a new generation of rapid, sensitive, and selective
biosensors as well as substantial scope for the improvement of current
systems, all with a common aim of improving point-of-care health monitoring.
Future work will focus on measurements in whole blood/serum. Given
the sensitivity of the current assay to the LOD of cTnI, there is
reason to be optimistic about the sensor’s performance in these
clinical samples.

Experimental Section
Materials
MAb228
(epitope region 26–35) and
MAb19c7 (epitope region 41–49) were purchased from HyTest Company.
The novel antibody, mAb20B3 (epitope 24–39, NYRAYATEPHAKKKSKI),
was custom-generated “in house”. 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS), DPBS, 16-MHDA, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate,
tri-n-propylamine, and Triton X-100 were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Ir(6-phenylphenanthridine)2 2-(carboxyethyl-phenyl)pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (Ir–COOH)
was synthesized, as reported elsewhere.53

Instrumentation
EIS and voltammetry were performed
using a CH Instruments, model 760E, electrochemical workstation. A
traditional three-electrode electrochemical cell was set up (22 ±
2 °C). A 2 mm diameter planar gold disk modified with the capture
antibody was employed as the working electrode. The counter electrode
was a large area coiled with a platinum wire and silver/silver chloride
(Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl) acted as a reference. EIS measurements were performed
inside a Faraday cage in 1 mM DPBS (pH = 7.4) at the OCP in the frequency
range of 0.01–100 000 Hz, with a 25 mV ac amplitude.
Time-resolved emission lifetime and anisotropy measurements were executed
on a PicoQuant FluoTime 100 time-correlated single-photon counting
system (λex = 458 nm) using a Thurlby Thandar Instruments
TGP110 10 MHz pulse generator. Luminescence images were recorded on
a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope using a 40× oil immersion
objective lens (NA 1.4) and a 488 nm argon ion laser applied for iridium-labeled
antibody imaging.

Methods
Photophysical Characterization
of Ir–mAbs
Because
of oxygen sensitivity, polarized emissions, and long emission decays
of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, luminescence lifetime and time-resolved
luminescence anisotropy were utilized to confirm antibody–Ir
conjugation. In particular, oxygen sensitivity is important as small
changes in the O2 accessibility of the metal center can
cause significant changes in luminescent lifetime, which can be a
useful confirmation of biomolecule conjugation, in the case of this
study, Ir–antibody conjugation. In all cases, an increase in
luminescent lifetime was observed (Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S2). Interestingly, the lifetime
for mAb20B3–Ir conjugate increased approximately 2-fold compared
to Ir–COOH alone, which is likely due to conformational arrangements
in which the complex is protected more from water and oxygen quenching.

Anisotropy utilizes rotational time θ measurements associated
with the emission transition moment that lies along the fluorophore
structure.54 The rotational time depends
on the viscosity of the solvent and on the size of the fluorophore.55 The bigger the fluorophore is, for example,
fluorophore bound to a protein, the longer the rotational time necessary
to achieve a depolarized emission. From the data recorded (Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S3),
the free complex did not present any anisotropy as predicted, whereas
the Ir–antibody conjugates presented rotational times ranging
from 480 to 760 ns. The fundamental anisotropy, r0, ranged from 0.4
(parallel transition dipoles) to −0.2 (perpendicular dipoles)
and from this value, the angle β between the absorption and
emission transition moment was calculated using eq 1 1  

β Values in
PBS solution ranged from 37 to 40° suggesting
similar dimensions following conjugation for all conjugates. Overall,
luminescence lifetime and anisotropy measurements demonstrated successful
Ir–antibody conjugation in all cases.

Expression and Purification
of Anti-cTnI mAb20B3
Purification of mAbs
Hybridoma cells
which express
mAb20B3 (against cTnI epitope 24–39) were produced by previous
study.56 Culture media from tissue culture
flasks derived from actively growing hybridomas were centrifuged at
125g for 5 min. The supernatant was then concentrated
from approximately 500–5 mL using an Amicon stir cell system
(GE Healthcare) with an ultrafiltration membrane (100 kDa molecular
weight “cut-off”).

Protein G Purification
of mAbs
Protein G (2 mL) was
added to a 20 mL column (VWR). The column was then rinsed twice with
5 mL of PBS and a A cap was placed on the column base. The IgG-containing
sample was added to the resin and gently mixed for 1 h on a roller
at 4 °C before addition to the column. The flow-through was reapplied
to the column. The whole process was then repeated three times. Afterward,
the column was then additionally washed twice with 10 mL of 1×
PBS (pH 7.5). The antibody was eluted with 10 mL of 100 mM glycine–HCl
buffer (pH 2.5). The eluted fractions were analyzed by determining
the absorbances at 280 nm. The fractions of the collected eluted antibodies
were then combined, concentrated, and buffer exchanged three times
against filtered (using 0.2 μL filter) 5 mL of PBS (pH 7.5)
using 10 000 MWCO Vivaspin columns (Sartorius, #VS0601) by
centrifuging at 3220g at 4 °C. Sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
and western blotting (WB) were then performed for the analysis of
expression and purification of 20B3 mAb (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Protein concentration was determined
by the bicinchoninic acid assay assay. The purified IgG was divided
into 100 μL aliquots and stored at −20 °C.

Figure S1 shows the SDS–PAGE and
WB probed with goat anti-mouse-Fc-specific antibody, followed by horseradish
peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-goat antibody. MW: protein ladder,
E2: 1:80 dilution of 20B3 mAb elution, E1: 1:20 dilution of 20B3 mAb
elution, W2: column wash 2, W1: column wash 1, F-T: “flow-through”.

Labeling of mAbs with Ir(III) Complexes
The mAbs were
labeled with the Ir–COOH complex by first activating the complex
dissolved in DMSO (0.03 M) with NHS and EDC (ration 4:1) at room temperature
for 20 min. Following this, the activated complex (10 μL) was
added directly to an Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of DPBS solution
(pH = 7.4) of the antibody (100 μg/mL) and allowed to slowly
stir at room temperature for 4 h. After that, the reaction mixture
was purified by different cycles of centrifugation using an ultracentrifugal
tube with a cutoff of 30 K.

Fabrication of Immunosensor
Scheme 1 illustrates
the troponin I (cTnI) immunosensor.
Initially, an SAM of MHDA was formed by immersing a gold electrode
(Au) for 24 h in an ethanol solution containing 1 mM 16 MHDA. After
the SAM formation, the Au/MHDA electrode was treated in a mixture
of 5 mM EDC, 15 mM NHS, and DPBS solution for 20 min at room temperature
to activate the carboxylic acid groups of MHDA. The custom capture
mAb, mAb20B3 (epitope 24–39), was subsequently covalently immobilized
on the Au/MHA electrode by incubating the modified electrode in a
0.1 M DPBS solution (pH 7.4) containing 100 μg/mL stock concentration
for approximately 1 hour at 37 °C. After coating with the capture
mAb, the Au/MHDA/mAb electrodes were incubated in various concentrations
of troponin in the range of 1 ag/mL to 1 ng/mL for an approximately
1 h at 37 °C. A commercial capture mAb with similar epitope regions
(Hytest mAb228, epitope region 26–35) to mAb20B3 was carried
out in parallel to compare the capture efficiency of the antibody.
After incubation with troponin I, the functionalized electrodes were
immersed in a DPBS solution containing the soluble labeled Ir–mAb19c7
(100 μg/mL stock concentration) for 1 h at 37 °C and again
washed, prior to electrochemical analysis.

Cross-Reactivity
of mAbs
In order to determine whether
the system has a high affinity to the specific cTns or is a generic
capture platform, peptide-specificity analysis was carried out on
Biacore 4000. Our group has previously carried out epitope-specificity
studies56 and eliminated issues with reactivity
against the other cTnI synthetic peptides and linker chemistries.
Epitope region specificity was confirmed by mapping experiments using
SPR, and discounting issues with reactivity against the other cTnI
synthetic peptides and linker chemistries and positive mAbs were found
to exclusively react with the synthetic peptide.
