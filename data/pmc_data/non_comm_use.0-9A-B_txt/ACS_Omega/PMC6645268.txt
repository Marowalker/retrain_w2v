The effect of preparation conditions
on the performance of Ni-based catalysts was investigated for glycerol
steam reforming. La0.7Ce0.3NiO3 mixed
oxides were synthesized using different solution concentrations and
calcination temperatures by a co-precipitation method. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
inductively coupled plasma, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed
reduction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, CO2-temperature-programmed desorption, thermal gravity analysis, and
Raman spectroscopy were performed to characterize the catalysts. With an La2NiO4 phase at lowest solution concentration, a catalyst precursor included
an LaNiO3 phase instead of La2NiO4 at other solution concentrations. At a low calcination temperature
of 700 °C, it was found that the smaller particle size of CeO2 incorporated more lanthanum and higher surface basicity,
and the La2O2CO3 phase could effectively
inhibit and eliminate coking leading to the better performance of
catalysts.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With energy crisis and
environmental issues, it is urgent to develop renewable energy resources.
Currently, the use of biomass to obtain liquid fuels has received
much interest, such as biodiesel with properties similar to diesel.
Biodiesel as carbon neutral fuel is biodegradable and nontoxic and
is derived from the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal
fats by reacting with alcohol to produce approximately 10% (w/w) of
crude glycerol. The profitability of biodiesel depends heavily on
the economics of the byproducts. Nowadays, glycerol is used mostly
in the pharmaceutical, personal care, food, and cleaning industries.
Glycerol is employed as a source of renewable hydrogen, which provides
a promising solution for the dilemma of surplus glycerol.

Various
routes for the preparation hydrogen by glycerol, namely steam reforming,1 autothermal reforming,2−4 partial oxidation,5 aqueous-phase reforming,6,7 and
supercritical water reforming,8 have been
extensively investigated. Glycerol steam reforming (GSR) is
a catalytic process and technology similar to those of methanol or
ethanol steam reforming and provides higher hydrogen yield at atmospheric
pressure,9 so, GSR is widely utilized.
GSR can be represented by eqs 1 and 2 1   2  Different methods of process intensification and catalytic
materials have been extensively studied for steam reforming. For example,
Dou et al. studied several methods of process intensification, such
as the sorption-enhanced steam reforming,10 chemical-looping steam reforming11,12 and the sorption-enhanced
chemical-looping steam reforming.13

In GSR, the most investigated materials are Ni-, Pt-, Co-, and Ru-based
catalysts,14−17 and less researched materials are Rh-, Ir-, and Pd-based catalysts.18−21 As a matter of fact, Ni-based catalysts are less costly and well-known
to promote the rupture of C–C, O–H, and C–H bonds.22−24 However, the main challenges for Ni-based catalysts are sinter,
carbon deposition, and rich hydrogen gas with a low CO concentration.
Accordingly, three strategies were presented to address these challenges
containing methodologies for the preparation of highly dispersed nickel
catalysts with a strong metal–support interaction, promotion
in the mobility of the surface oxygen, and then the removal of surface
carbon deposition and process intensification via in situ absorption
of CO2.25

Furthermore,
perovskite-type mixed oxides, represented by the general formula ABO3, as catalyst precursors have received increasing attention
due to their special crystal structures.26−29 In ABO3 structures,
the A-site is a large rare earth cation and the B-site is a small
cation of a d-transition metal, which may be partially substituted
by A and B cations of similar oxidation state and ionic radius.22 These mixed oxides are able to produce highly
dispersed metallic particles upon reduction, which inhibit the formation
of carbon, and exhibit a high oxygen mobility (OM), which may be beneficial
for the removal of carbon deposits.27 In
addition, Kamonsuangkasem et al.24 reported
that after reducing the catalysts, the CeAlO3 perovskite
suppresses the interaction between Ni and Al2O3, thereby increasing the number of active and Brønsted acid
sites to improve the bifunctional metal–acid properties of
Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 in the hydrogenolysis
and dehydrogenation–dehydration of condensable intermediates
that produce more H2. However, Veiga et al.30 manifested that after reducing the catalysts,
LaTiO3 perovskite has no effect on catalytic performance.

For LaNiO3, the effect of partial substitution of La
with a great range of metal cations (Ce, Ca, Sr, Sm, Nd, etc.) was
widely investigated.22,31,32 But less investigations about the effect of preparation conditions
on the performance of perovskite-type mixed oxides are found. In this
work, solution concentrations and calcination temperatures were studied
over a series of La0.7Ce0.3NiO3 mixed
oxides prepared by the co-precipitation method. Several characterization
techniques and online analyses of gas phase products were used to
determine the performance of catalysts in GSR.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Catalysts
The analysis results of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
are summarized in Table 1. A 6 wt % loading of Ni on L900-0.03-0.1 is much less than that
on other catalysts in the range of 12–14 wt %, which exhibits
that Ni loading decreases dramatically with solution concentration
declining to a certain extent. It is found that calcination temperature
influences the textural properties of catalysts. When catalysts are
calcined at 700 °C, the solution concentration remarkably affects
the textural properties. L700-3-1.9 shows the highest specific surface
area, pore volume, and pore diameter.

L700-3-1.9	14	101	0.46	44.2	
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of calcined samples are shown in Figure 1. The CeO2 phase shifting to lower Bragg angles due to lanthana doping, and
the perovskite phase were found in all samples without the detection
of the NiO phase, which indicated that the used co-preparation method
was efficient to produce the perovskite structure.22 The appearance of the perovskite structure was not affected
by the investigated calcination temperature, which was consistent
with the study result of Glisenti et al.26 The La2NiO4 phase (2θ = 32.5°)
was presented only in L900-0.03-0.1, with the LaNiO3 phase
(2θ = 23.2, 32.8, 47.3, 58.6°) instead of the La2NiO4 phase in other catalysts. For preparing catalysts
with constant mole numbers of nitrate and precipitant, the formation
of La2NiO4 requires less nickel than that of
LaNiO3. Thus, L900-0.03-0.1 had the lowest Ni content in
agreement with the ICP result. At a low calcination temperature of
700 °C, it was obvious that the diffraction peaks of the CeO2 phase were more diffusive. Smaller particles of CeO2 possess significantly more Ce3+ sites, which contributes
to the higher reducibility of the ceria.33 Tang et al.34 had reported that the Ce3+ content was higher, implying the higher oxygen vacancy density,
which enhanced the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and surface oxygen
mobility (OM).

Figure 1 XRD patterns of La0.7Ce0.3NiO3 perovskite-type mixed oxides.

After reduction treatment (Figure 2A,B), all catalysts mainly decomposed to
Ni (2θ = 44.6, 51.8, 76.4°), La(OH)3 (2θ
= 15.6, 27.5, 39.5, 48.6°), and CeO2 with lanthana
doping. As shown in Figure 2B, a shift of the diffraction peaks of CeO2 was
larger at a calcination temperature of 700 °C, which manifested
CeO2 by doping more lanthana. The introduction of other
metal cations as dopants (such as La3+) can also modify
OSC and surface oxygen mobility OM of the oxide by lowering the barrier
for oxygen migration and decreasing the activation energy for the
reduction of the ceria species.25,35 Therefore, higher OSC
and OM in L700-0.3-0.6 and L700-3-1.9 could only be inferred from
the available data, which contributed to the gasification of the carbonaceous
deposits. The mean Ni crystal sizes were 11, 11, 12, 13, and 13 nm
corresponding to L900-0.03-0.1, L900-0.3-0.6, L900-3-1.9, L700-0.3-0.6,
and L700-3-1.9, respectively, which revealed that Ni crystal sizes
did not have clear correlation with calcination temperature and solution
concentration. L900-0.03-0.1 had the weakest intensity of the diffraction
peak of Ni due to the lowest Ni content as discussed above.

Figure 2 XRD patterns
of reduced catalysts. (A) 10–65° of 2θ and (B) 35–56°
of 2θ.

The reduction profiles
of catalysts are shown in Figure 3. The peaks of other catalysts except L900-0.03-0.1
within 300–400 and 500–550 °C were defined for
the LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxides,22,31 although there were more than three peaks attributing to the fluctuation
of the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) system and the reduction
of CeO2.36 The reduction peak
of L900-0.03-0.1 at highest temperature was ascribed to the existence
of La2NiO4,31 which
indicated that L900-0.03-0.1 had the strongest metal–support
interaction. Moreover, L900-0.03-0.1 had the lowest amount of hydrogen
consumption in all samples because of the lowest Ni content (Table 1).

Figure 3 H2-TPR profiles
of La0.7Ce0.3NiO3 perovskite-type
mixed oxides (10 °C/min).

The CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
profiles of reduced catalysts are shown in Figure 4. Two major peaks were observed at 67–152
°C originating from the decomposition of a monodentate carbonate
and at 267–647 °C probably arising from the decomposition
of bidentate and/or bridged carbonates.37 It was concluded that calcination temperature and solution concentration
could affect the surface basic properties of the catalysts. At a calcination
temperature of 700 °C, a large amount of strong basic sites of
catalysts could be inferred from their high specific surface area.
The maximum amount of weak basic sites was obtained, at the highest
solution concentration. As the solution concentration decreased, the
strong basic sites of the catalysts increased. Charisiou et al.38 revealed that active sites for glycerol conversion
are not necessarily based on Ni0, but it is the basicity
of the catalysts (oxygen anion sites) which is the key parameter to
form acetol and even break the C–C bonds to a certain extent.
Vizcaíno et al.39 provided that
coke formation from ethylene decreased, thanks to the basic properties
of Ca/SBA-15 and Mg/SBA-15 supports. Sahraei et al.1 concluded that the enhanced steam adsorption in the presence
of basic materials could also help the oxidation of carbonaceous deposits.

2.2 Catalytic Performance
Catalytic performance
was investigated at 575 °C for GSR with S/C = 5 after 2.5 h of
feeding in all samples. The blank experiment in the absence of the
catalysts was run under the same conditions to observe that the hydrogen
product was negligible. In addition, C2H4 and
C2H6 were not detected in all experiments. The
yield of the gas product and Xg are given
in Figure 5. The CH4 yield was about 2% for all samples, which indicated that
hydrogenation reactions between CO/CO2 and H2 formed were inhibited.40 The molar CO/CO2 ratio was about 0.5 on L900-0.03-0.1, whereas the ratio was
approximately 0.2 on other samples. This result illustrated that all
catalysts facilitated the water–gas-shift reaction (WGSR).
L900-0.03-0.1 had a relatively lower molar CO/CO2 ratio
which might due to different catalyst precursors. The H2 yields were 57, 79, 82, 82, and 91% corresponding to L900-0.03-0.1,
L900-0.3-0.6, L900-3-1.9, L700-0.3-0.6, and L700-3-1.9, respectively. Xg were 60, 92, 88, 95, and 100%, respectively.
L700-3-1.9 with the highest Ni content and specific surface area had
the highest initial H2 yield and Xg. L900-0.03-0.1 with the minimum Ni content had the lowest
initial H2 yield and Xg. The
result elucidated that the catalytic activity positively correlated
with the primary Ni content and the specific surface area, but was
unrelated to the particle size of Ni. Meanwhile, Goula et al.41 proved that despite much lower specific surface
area of apatite-type lanthanum silicates (ATLSs) compared to the Al2O3 support and their eventually larger Ni crystallites,
Ni-ATLS exhibit excellent low temperature conversion rates and selectivity
towards H2 production.

Figure 5 Yield of the gas product and Xg for all samples in GSR after 2.5 h of feeding (reaction
conditions: T = 575 °C, S/C = 5, and W/F = 49.7
g h/mol).

Stability tests of catalysts with
similar Ni content were performed for 21.5 h. The yield of the gas
product and Xg are displayed in Figure 6. There is always
a gap between the data obtained after 10.5 and 20 h in Figure 7, because the data were not
collected at night. The average CH4 yield was near 2%,
and the average molar CO/CO2 ratio was about 0.3 in all
catalysts. Hence, the prepared catalysts could hinder methanation
reaction and promote WGSR. The H2 yield declined smoothly
from 80 to 66%, and Xg decreased from
92 to 70% for L900-0.3-0.6 during stability experiment. There was
a rapid decline in H2 yield from 82 to 44%, and Xg had the same change trend for L900-3-1.9.
After the H2 yield reduced from 82 to 70% within the initial
4.5 h, the H2 yield was basically stable at around 70%
for L700-0.3-0.6. Meanwhile, the same change trend was observed in Xg. There was a rapid decrease in H2 yield from 91 to 60% and in Xg from
100 to 61% during 21.5 h for L700-3-1.9. Furthermore, the reductions
of H2 yield and Xg were extremely
slow after 9.5 h.

(b) L900-3-1.9, (c) L700-0.3-0.6, and (d) L700-3-1.9.

Figure 7 Yield of the gas product and Xg over L700-0.3-0.6 after 3 h of feeding in GSR (reaction conditions: T = 400, 450, 500, 575, and 700 °C, S/C = 5 and W/F
= 49.7 g h/mol).

The reaction temperature
from 400 to 700 °C was studied after 3 h of feeding over L700-0.3-0.6
with the best performance. The experimental result is illustrated
in Figure 7. Xg increased with the increasing temperature
below 575 °C and it underwent a drop from 575 to 700 °C.
H2 yield raised with the increasing temperature below 500
°C, and it underwent a drop from 500 to 700 °C; H2 yields at 500 and 575 °C were rather close. Possible explanations
for the above results were the C–C bond cleavage favored at
higher temperatures, the thermodynamic equilibrium and carbon deposits.23,32,42,43 CH4 yield was very low over the whole temperature range,
which clarified that the prepared catalysts had a sufficient capacity
for reforming CH4 into hydrogen and carbon oxide.38,44,45 It was worth noting that H2 yield could reach around 60% at 450 °C.

2.3 Characterization of the Used Catalysts
The XRD patterns
(Figure 8) show main
phases of all used catalysts including Ni, La2O2CO3 (2θ = 11.1, 22.2, 25.8, 30.3, 44.4°), and
CeO2 with lanthana doping. It was only inferred from the
available data that the appearance of the La2O2CO3 phase rather than the La(OH)3 phase was
assigned to the existence of CO2 under reaction conditions.31,46,47 Verykios et al.48 discovered that the catalytic activity occurs at the Ni–La2O2CO3 interface, whereas the oxycarbonate
species participate directly by reacting with deposited carbon, thus
restoring the activity of the Ni sites at the interface. Simultaneously,
de Lima et al.27 reported that La2O2CO3 strongly interacts with Ni particles,
inhibiting sintering during the reaction. The lines of Ni phase overlap
with those of the La2O2CO3 phase,
thus, it is difficult to estimate the particle size of Ni on used
samples.

Figure 8 XRD patterns of the used catalysts after stability tests.

Raman spectroscopy of the used catalysts (Figure 9) is performed to
characterize the structure of the deposited coke after stability tests.
All samples had two characteristic peaks located at around 1338 cm–1 (D band) and 1587 cm–1 (G band),
usually assigned to phonons of E2g and A1g symmetry,
respectively.49−51 It was obvious that the D band area was greater than
the G band area, which indicated a predominance of a low degree of
crystalline carbon species in all samples.

Figure 9 Raman spectra of the
used catalysts after stability tests.

Additionally, the deposited carbon was determined by thermal
gravity analysis (TGA). The derivative thermograms are shown in Figure 10. To exclude the
influence of La2O2CO3, all samples
were pretreated at 800 °C for 30 min, the mass losses were 3.2,
3.5, 4.3, and 4.0% corresponding to L900-0.3-0.6, L900-3-1.9, L700-0.3-0.6,
and L700-3-1.9, respectively. In Figure 10, the slight mass gain of L900-3-1.9 was
observed, whereas other catalysts had an obvious increase in the mass,
reaching the maximum mass at 403 °C for all catalysts. The result
could be due to the oxidations of metal nickel and Ce3+.23,52 Different carbon types were obtained for
each catalyst, because of amorphous carbon oxidizing below 550 °C
and the oxidation of graphitic/filamentous carbon required higher
temperature.53,54 It was reported that the catalyst/support
system governed the type of the carbon deposited as coke at the end
of the reaction.55 The mass of carbon deposition
was represented by the difference between the maximum mass due to
oxidation and the minimum mass. Thereby, the mass loss due to carbon
deposition followed the order, L700-0.3-0.6 (9.9%) < L700-3-1.9
(13.9%) < L900-3-1.9 (19.7%) < L900-0.3-0.6 (22.4%). The CO,
CH4, and C2 species were the initiating species of the
coke deposited as some of them underwent a further Boudouard reaction,
methane decomposition, and polymerization, respectively, forming different
coke species on the catalyst surface.24 Furthermore, CO2-TPD indicated that the surface basicity
of the catalysts followed the order L900-0.3-0.6 < L900-3-1.9 <
L700-0.3-0.6 < L700-3-1.9, and surface basicity of L700-0.3-0.6
was slightly lower than that of L700-3-1.9. Therefore, L700-0.3-0.6
had the lowest coking amount contributed to high basic site density,
highest La2O2CO3 mass, CeO2 with more lanthana doping, and smaller particle size of CeO2. L900-0.3-0.6 had the highest coking amount ascribed to the
lowest basic site density and La2O2CO3 mass. While there was still high H2 yield (66%) for L900-0.3-0.6
after 21.5 h of reaction. This result could be due to most carbonaceous
species covering the surface of supports rather than Ni active centers.
Coking was mainly influenced by surface basicity of the catalysts
and the mass of La2O2CO3 in this
work, but coking was significantly associated with the particle size
of Ni in other literature studies.31,56

Figure 10 TGA curves
for used catalysts after stability tests.

The co-precipitation method with a fixed molar ratio was
effective for the appearance of La2O2CO3 in catalysts, because there was a reaction between La(OH)3 in reduced and fresh catalysts and CO2 in the
reaction system. The synthesis method affected the textural, structural,
and surface properties of the catalysts.57 In this work preparation conditions also influenced the physicochemical
properties of catalysts. It was corroborated that catalytic deactivation
was determined by growth situation and amount of coke. Amadeo et al.58 demonstrated that filaments are not generated
by the direct involvement of the surface metal but rather they grow
with the mechanisms involving a surface containing both acid and base
functionality.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, the solution concentration and calcination temperature could
influence physicochemical, structural, and textural properties of
the synthesized catalysts. L900-0.03-0.1 with the lowest Ni content
had the lowest initial activity, so, the decline in solution concentration
to a certain extent was adverse to nickel deposition. L700-3-1.9 had
excellent initial activity contributed to the highest Ni content and
specific surface area. L700-0.3-0.6 exhibited optimal catalytic performance,
because of the lowest coking content due to the highest La2O2CO3 mass, high density of basic sites, and
small particle size of CeO2 doping more lanthana. The correlation
of the physicochemical properties of catalysts with catalytic performance
revealed that the co-precipitation method with a fixed molar ratio
in proper solution concentration and low calcination temperature induced
great catalytic performance for glycerol steam reforming. The growth
situation of carbon deposition should be further studied for future
work.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation
Method
When La0.7Ce0.3NiO3 mixed oxides were prepared by the co-precipitation method, the molar
ratio of 0.7:0.3:1:5 for La3+, Ce3+, Ni2+, and HCO31– was kept constant.
Only solution concentration and calcination temperature were varied
in the co-precipitation procedure. The specific synthesis procedures
were as follows. La(NO3)3·6H2O (99.0%, Kelon), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.0%, Kelon), and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.0%, Kelon) were dissolved in distilled water together
to receive three different total concentrations with 0.03, 0.3, and
3 mol/L. Meanwhile, ammonium hydrogen carbonate was dissolved in distilled
water to obtain three different concentrations with 0.1, 0.6, and
1.9 mol/L. Then, the three resulting precipitates obtained by adding
the corresponding precipitant to nitrate solution were filtered, washed
with distilled water, and dried at 80 °C for 2 h and at 110 °C
for 6 h. After this, the materials were carefully ground in a mortar,
and then calcined for 6 h at a certain temperature, labeled as LT-x-y (T is the calcination temperature, T = 900 or 700
°C, x is the concentration of nitrate solution, x = 0.03, 0.3 and 3 mol/L, y is the precipitant
concentration, y = 0.1, 0.6 and 1.9 mol/L). Finally,
L900-0.03-0.1, L900-0.3-0.6, L900-3-1.9, L700-0.3-0.6, and L700-3-1.9
were synthesized.

4.2 Characterization Method
Nitrogen physisorption measurements were conducted using a surface
area analyzer (Belsorp-max). Catalysts were degassed at 350 °C
for 4 h before N2 adsorption–desorption measurements.
The textural properties of the catalysts were obtained by the BET
and BJH methods.

After microwave digestion of reduced samples
in aqua regia, the nickel content was determined by ICP-AES (Agilent
7700x).

XRD data were collected using an X’Pert3 Powder
Diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm). The Scherrer equation was used to calculate
the mean Ni crystal size based on the diffraction peak of the Ni(111)
facet.

The reducibility of the catalyst precursor was evaluated
by TPR using a 6 vol % H2/Ar flow. 30 mg of sample in a
U-shaped quartz tube was heated from 50 to 900 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min.

Surface basicity of the reduced catalyst
was measured by the CO2-temperature-programmed desorption
(CO2-TPD). 50 mg of the catalyst was reduced at 650 °C
for 30 min, followed by flushing with 50 mL/min Ar for 30 min at 650
°C and then cooling down. A 10 vol % CO2/Ar flow (50
mL/min) was adsorbed at 50 °C for 1 h, and then the sample was
purged by 50 mL/min Ar for 30 min. Finally, the TPD of CO2 was performed from 50 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
in an Ar flow (50 mL/min).

TGA (STARe System METTLERTOLEDO
Corp.) was used to investigate the carbon deposition of the used catalyst.
The catalyst was pretreated at 800 °C for 30 min and then cooled
to room temperature in 50 mL/min N2. Next, the catalyst
was heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min in 50 mL/min air.

Raman spectroscopy was performed
to characterize the carbon deposition of 10 mg of the used catalyst.
Raman spectra were obtained using an inVia Raman Microscope (inVia
Reflex) with a He–Ne green laser (532.14 nm) at ambient conditions
in the range of 1000–2000 cm–1.

4.3 Catalysis Measurement
The catalytic tests were investigated
in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (inner diameter 8 mm) loaded with 100
mg of powder catalyst. Prior to starting a test, catalyst was reduced
in situ at 650 °C under a 5 vol % H2/N2 flow (30 mL/min) for 40 min. The feed liquid with a steam to carbon
molar ratio equaling 5 (S/C = 5), was fed at 0.012 mL/min through
a peristaltic pump at a space time of 49.7 g h/mol. Besides, N2 carrier gas was kept at 30 mL/min by a mass flow controller.
The products passed through a cold trap for liquid product capture
and then a bed of silica gel (16 cm). The gas products were analyzed
online by gas chromatography (Pgeneral GC 1100) equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector and a TDX-01 column (80–100 mesh) with
N2 carrier gas. The catalytic performance was evaluated
by hydrogen yield (YH2), glycerol
conversion to gaseous products (Xg), and
yield of C-containing gas product (Yi)      where, i is
the CO, CO2, or CH4.
