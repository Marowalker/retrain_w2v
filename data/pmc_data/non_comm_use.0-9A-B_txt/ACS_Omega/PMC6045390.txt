To find out potential GDNF family
receptor α1 (GFRα1)
agonists, small molecules were built up by molecular fragments according
to the structure-based drug design approach. Molecular docking was
used to identify their binding modes to the biological target GFRα1
in GDNF-binding pocket. Thereafter, commercially available compounds
based on the best predicted structures were searched from ZINC and
MolPort databases (similarity ≥ 80%). Five compounds from the
ZINC library were tested in phosphorylation and luciferase assays
to study their ability to activate GFRα1–RET. A bidental
compound with two carboxyl groups showed the highest activity in molecular
modeling and biological studies. However, the relative position of
these groups was important. The meta-substituted structure otherwise
identical to the most active compound 2-[4-(5-carboxy-1H-1,3-benzodiazol-2-yl)phenyl]-1H-1,3-benzodiazole-5-carboxylic
acid was inactive. A weaker activity was detected for a compound with
a single carboxyl group, that is, 4-(1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl)benzoic acid.
The substitution of the carboxyl group by the amino or acetamido group
also led to the loss of the activity.

Introduction
Glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands
(GFLs) consist of GDNF, neurturin (NRTN), artemin (ARTN), and persephin
(PSPN).1 GDNF and NRTN have demonstrated
the ability to support the survival of brain dopamine-producing neurons,
thus being potential therapeutic agents for Parkinson’s disease.2−4 The survival of sympathetic and sensory neurons is supported by
ARTN, and hence it has been considered for the treatment of chronic
pain.5 However, the development of therapies
for neurological diseases based on GFLs has serious problems associated
with the delivery, stability, and potential side and off-target effects
of these ligands.6 Therefore, the discovery
of small molecules that bind to and activate GFL receptors would have
large potential for the development of new strategies against neurodegenerative
disorders.6−8 GDNF specifically binds to GDNF family receptor α1
(GFRα1), and then the complex binds to and signals through the
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase RET. ARTN binds to GFRα3,
NRTN to GFRα2, and also signal to the cells via RET.1 Presently, structures of two scaffolds acting
as the GDNF receptor agonists have been reported, XIB40359 and BT1310 (Figure 1). Also BT13 derivative,
compound called BT18 activates RET.11

The aim of the current work was to find out new low molecular
weight
compounds acting as GFRα1 receptor agonists using the structure-based
drug-design approach and molecular docking. The potential binding
site for such agonists was searched by examining the protein–protein
interactions on the binding interface between GDNF and GFRα1
in the GDNF–GFRα1–RET complex. A strong binding
of a small-molecule ligand in this site could lead to the conformational
changes and to the RET signaling.

Results and Discussion
GDNF–GFRα1
Interface
Essential interactions
at the binding interface between the GDNF and GFRα1 (i.e., hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic areas) were examined using the available crystal
structures of the complex (PDB codes: 4UX8(12) and 3FUB;13 see Target in Methods). GFRα1 was treated as a receptor and GDNF as
a ligand. There are several notable regions of the ligand–receptor
interaction. First, three hydrogen bonds are formed by amine group
of Arg171 and Arg224 (GFRα1) with oxygens of carboxylate group
of Glu61 (GDNF). Three hydrogen bonds are also formed involving amine
groups and carbonyl oxygens of peptide bond between Asn162 (GFRα1)
and Glu62 (GDNF), Asn162 (GFRα1) and Ser112 (GDNF), and Arg224
(GFRα1) and Leu114 (GDNF). The hydroxyl groups of Ser172 (GFRα1)
and Tyr120 (GDNF) are also hydrogen bond donors to the carbonyl oxygens
of peptide bonds of Asp110 and Gln227, respectively (Figure 2). In addition, potential van
der Waals interactions between the side groups of neighboring residues
of the ligand, and the receptor can stabilize the binding complex
(see Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). GDNF docking results are well in line with the
previously published GFRα114,15 and GDNF16 mutagenesis studies. Our assumption was that
low-molecular-weight ligands (MW < 500) have to bind to residues
of amino acids of GFRα1, therefore imitating the native ligand
GDNF. According to the analysis of binding site for the GFRα1–GDNF
complex, the key residues for interactions with a small molecule are
Arg171 and Arg224 residues of the receptor which is in line with the
previously published data.14,15 Consequently, the ligand
acting as a potential receptor agonist has to be bound in the region
of Thr179, Arg171, Arg224, and Gln227, forming hydrogen bonds to Arg171,
Arg224, and/or Gln227.

and GDNF (blue) are colored as gray (carbon), blue (nitrogen), red
(oxygen), and white (hydrogen). Hydrogen bonds are represented in
green dashed lines.

Ligands Construction and
Docking
The ligands were built
up using molecular fragments that have significant docking binding
to these receptor areas [see structure-based drug design (SBDD) approach
in Methods]. The first group of ligand structures
consisted of fragments of benzoate anion and its alkyl-substituted
(Me, Et, and i-Pr) derivatives at the meta position.
The length of the carbon chain (CH2)n of the carboxylate substituent was also varied, with n = 0, 1, and 2 (Figure 3A). Thereafter, the heterocyclic derivatives were generated
by the substitution of carbon atoms by up to two nitrogen atoms in
the benzene ring (Figure 3B). The calculated binding energies for the studied 28 molecules
from the first group of structures (Table S2) were in the range of −4.3 to −5.6 kcal/mol. Only
one of the heterocyclic compounds (25) was able to demonstrate
substantial specific binding, as illustrated in Figure 4A, where the nitrogen atom of this compound
is hydrogen bonded to the amine group of Arg171 and has additional
van der Waals interactions with residues of Ile175, Thr179, Met211,
Gln227, and Thr228. All results from the molecular docking calculations,
that is, the corresponding binding energies and binding modes, are
given in Table S2 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Structures of low-molecular-weight ligands used in the molecular
docking to receptor GFRα1.

Figure 4 Calculated binding modes of compound 25 (A), compound 42 (B), compound 77 (C), and compound 86 (D) in the active site of GFRα1 (PDB code: 4UX8). The amino acid
residues of GFRα1 are colored as gray (carbon), blue (nitrogen),
red (oxygen), and white (hydrogen). Hydrogen bonds formed between
compound and residues of GFRα1 are represented in green dashed
lines.

The second group of the constructed
GFRα1 receptor ligands
included 46 structures, where (i) at the R2 position, hydrophobic
alkyl group in the cyclic structures was substituted by hydroxyl,
hydroxymethyl, amino, or aminomethyl groups (Figure 3C) enabling to form an additional hydrogen
bond; (ii) more flexible cyclohexene (Figure 3D) or cyclohexanone basic structures (Figure 3E) were also used
instead of rigid aromatic rings; and (iii) the carboxylate group was
replaced by sulfonate group (Figure 3F), which can be strongly bound to proteins. The free
energy of binding for all compounds was similar, which is in the range
of −4.4 to −5.2 kcal/mol. Compounds consisting of more
flexible cyclohexene or cyclohexanone rings as well as the sulfonate
group did not have significantly lower binding energy. Most of the
ligands of this subclass formed hydrogen bonds with the receptor by
the carboxyl oxygens and/or by the added polar substituent at the
R2 position, by the nitrogen atom of the aromatic cycle,
and by an oxygen atom of the sulfonate group (Table S2). As an example, compound 42 has two
hydrogen bonds between its carboxyl oxygens and NH2 group
of Gln227 as well as between its CH2OH group and NH group
of Arg171 in addition to the interactions with Ile175, Met211, Arg224,
and Thr228 (Figure 4B).

The third group of developed GFRα1 receptor ligands
was built
using the following fragments: (i) flexible 5-oxocyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylate,
(ii) hydroxyl group, and (iii) hydroxyalkyl group (n of alkyl chain (CH2)n = 0–4; Figure 3G) or (2-hydroxyalkylcyclopropyl)methyl
group (n of alkyl chain (CH2)n = 0–2; Figure 3H). The binding energies for these eight compounds
ranged from −5.0 to −6.1 kcal/mol (Table S2). Figure 4C demonstrates the binding mode of compound 77, which forms three hydrogen bonds by its carboxyl oxygens with amine
group of Arg224, by hydroxypropyl group with the amine group of Gln227,
and by hydroxyl group with carbonyl oxygen of Thr228 as well as van
der Waals interactions with nearby residues of Arg171, Ile175, Met211,
and Val230 of GFRα1.

According to the docking results
on compounds from all these groups,
we can conclude that (1) compounds with rigid aromatic ring(s) give
somewhat lower binding energies than compounds with flexible cycles;
(2) besides carboxyl functional group, hydroxyl group and its analogues
as well as nitrogen atom of the heteroaromatic cycle may lead to additional
hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues of GFRα1. Proceeding
from these observations, the fourth group of 10 structures was constructed
from fragments based on quinoline-3-carboxylate or isoquinoline-3-carboxylate,
hydroxyl or hydroxymethyl group, and (2-hydroxyalkylcyclopropyl)methyl
group (Figure 3I,J).
This group showed the lowest binding energies: −5.5 to −6.4
kcal/mol (Table S2). Surprisingly, only
one hydrogen bond was formed through carboxyl oxygens of ligand to
the amine group of Arg224 as demonstrated in Figure 4D for compound 86, which has
also van der Waals contacts with Arg171, Thr179, Met211, Gln227, and
Thr228.

Testing of Potential GFRα1 Receptor Agonists
On the basis of the last group of structures, similar compounds were
searched from ZINC17 and MolPort18 databases (see Table S2). Five available compounds from the ZINC library (Figure 5) were initially tested in
5 and 20 μM concentrations in luciferase assay in cells expressing
GFRα1–RET.19 Those ones activating
luciferase by 1.5 times and above (compounds 107 and 118) were selected for dose-dependent experiments and RET
phosphorylation (RET pY) assays (see Experimental
Section); the remaining compounds were considered inactive
(fold induction below 1.5 at 20 μM) and excluded from further
experiments. As predicted by the modeling, the bidental compound 107 with two carboxyl groups has the highest activity. Notably,
a weak activity was detected for a much smaller compound 118 with a single carboxyl group in its structure. However, the relative
position of these groups is important. The meta-substituted structure 108 otherwise identical to compound 107 is inactive.
The substitution of the carboxyl group in compound 118 by the amino or acetamido group (compounds 119 and 120, respectively) also leads to the loss of the activity.

Figure 5 Compounds
tested in luciferase assay in cells expressing GFRα1–RET.

Thus, compounds 107 and 118 were tested
in luciferase assay in six concentrations (0.1, 1, 5, 10, 25, and
50 μM). Notably, compound 118 is a close derivative
of the compound XIX described in the patent.20 Application of 107 to GFRα1–RET expressing
cells led to moderate activation of luciferase [one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) F(12,39) = 33.11] in 25 μM
(1526 ± 77.61 vs 514.8 ± 43.77 in control, P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test)
and 50 μM concentrations (1963 ± 193.1 vs 514.8 ±
43.77 in control, P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s post hoc test), application of 50 μM 118—to borderline activation of luciferase (956.3 ±
78.89 vs 514.8 ± 43.77, P = 0.0063, one-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test) (Figure 6). To confirm luciferase assay results and
evaluate the ability of these compounds to stimulate RET by direct
methods, the selected compounds were tested in RET pY assays using
western blotting. RET was immunoprecipitated, and western blotting
membranes were probed first with antibodies against phosphorylated
tyrosine residues (pY) and afterward—against RET protein to
evaluate protein loading. Resulting images were quantified using Visual
Studio software. Compound 118 failed to activate RET
pY (relative intensity 0.70 ± 0.17 in control vs 0.64 ±
0.11 in compound-treated cell lysates, N = 3). Compound 107 activated RET pY in the cells expressing GFRα1–RET
but not in the cells expressing only RET (Figure 7A–C). Repeated measurements (RMs)
ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between treatment
groups in RET pY assay in both GFRα1–RET (P = 0.0020, F(1.120,5.601) = 28.31) and GFP–RET
(P = 0.0219, F(1.069,4.275)) expressing
cells (Figure 7B,C).
Post hoc Dunnett’s test revealed that compound 107 increased RET pY by 45% (relative intensity 0.68 ± 0.17 in
control vs 0.99 ± 0.26 in compound-treated group, P = 0.0405, RM ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test) in GFRα1–RET,
but not in GFP–RET expressing cells (relative intensity 0.42
± 0.16 in control vs 0.34 ± 0.077 in compound-treated group, P = 0.693 RM ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test).
As expected, the positive controls (GDNF in GFRα1–RET
and soluble GFRα1–GDNF complex in GFP–RET expressing
cells) increased RET pY by 3.8-fold (P = 0.0042,
RM ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test) and 4.9-fold (P = 0.0465, RM ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test)
in GFRα1–RET and GFP–RET expressing cells, respectively.
These results indicate that compound 107 might, similarly
to GDNF protein, require the presence of GFRα1 coreceptor to
stimulate RET pY.

ng/mL) (a1/GDNF) in GFP-transfected cells (C). WB—western blotting,
IP—immunoprecipitation.

The discrepancy between luciferase assay and RET pY assay
data
for compound 118 can be explained by the differences
in the sensitivity of these assays. Luciferase assay is extremely
sensitive and accumulates signals for the prolonged period of time
that can include multiple cycles of RET and downstream signaling cascade
activation, whereas RET pY assay is less sensitive and reflects activation
of the receptor that is achieved at the moment of cell lysis. Another
possibility is RET independent activation of luciferase in response
to compound 118. Luciferase assay is designed to represent
an activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway.19 This pathway includes multiple
regulatory proteins that can be targeted by compound 118.

All corresponding binding modes obtained by molecular docking
are
illustrated in Figure 8. The most active compound 107 forms hydrogen bond by
its carboxyl oxygens with NH group of Arg224 and interacts with Thr180,
Ala220, Gln227, and Val230 (Figure 8A). The another potential GFRα1 receptor agonist 118 has also one hydrogen bond between its carboxyl oxygens
and amine group of Arg224 as well as van der Waals interactions with
residues of Arg171, Met211, Gln227, Thr228, and Val230 (Figure 8C). Although inactive compounds 108 and 120 also form hydrogen bonds (Figure 8B,E), their molecular
configuration can be different in solution and there is no binding.
For instance, dipole moments μ are different for para- and meta-substituted
structures 107 and 108 (μpara < μmeta), respectively.

blue (nitrogen), red (oxygen), and white (hydrogen). Hydrogen bonds
formed between compound and residues of GFRα1 are represented
in green dashed lines.

MD Simulations of GFRα1–Ligand Complexes
To
specify the nature of the ligand–protein interactions,
the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA)21 binding energy calculations were carried out
using data from molecular dynamics simulations. In MM/PBSA, the free
energy of a state (ligand or protein) is estimated from the following
sum 1  where the first three terms
are standard molecular
mechanics energy terms from bonded (bond, angle, and dihedral), electrostatic,
and van der Waals interactions. Gpol and Gnp are the polar and nonpolar contributions
to the solvation free energies, respectively. Gpol is typically obtained by solving the Poisson–Boltzmann
equation or by using the generalized Born model (giving the MM/GBSA
approach), whereas the nonpolar term is estimated from a linear relation
to the solvent accessible surface area. The last term in the above
equation is the absolute temperature, T, multiplied
by the entropy, S, estimated by a normal-mode analysis
of the vibrational frequencies. The results for the lowest binding
energy states for the complexes of compounds 107, 108, and 118 with GFRα1 at the GDNF–GFRα1
interface are given in Table 1. The binding free energy for the active para-substituted
compound 107 is by 19.0 kcal/mol and by 9.4 kcal/mol
lower than that for the inactive meta-substituted compound 108 and for compound 118 with weaker activity, respectively.

The binding mode of compound 107 was also confirmed
by the counterpart molecular dynamics modeling. The simulations carried
out at the GFRα1 interface to GDNF indicated strong hydrogen
bonding of the carboxylate groups of the ligand to the receptor residues
Arg224 and Thr180 (Figures 9 and S2). This binding is complemented
by the water-assisted binding of the nitrogen atoms of the benzimidazole
rings to residues Glu223 and Glu227.

Figure 9 Calculated binding mode of compound 107 by the molecular
dynamics simulations.

It should be noted that this compound is very different from
the
earlier reported active compounds, that is, XIB40359 and BT13.10 XIB4035 is unable
to activate RET in the absence of endogenous ligand, that is, GFL,22 and BT13 is the RET agonist that is able to
signal in the absence and presence of GFRα coreceptors. Therefore,
compound 107 seems to represent a new scaffold that can
be further optimized to develop efficient GFRα1 agonists. Although
weak biological activity of 107 makes the evaluation
of its interaction with GFRα1 difficult, biological data indicate
that it might be the first compound activating GDNF receptor system
via GFRα1 coreceptor in the absence of endogenous GFL. Thus,
further biochemical and cellular testing of such compounds have large
biomedical interest.

Methods
Structure-Based Drug Design
When the three-dimensional
structure of biomolecular target is known, the SBDD approach can be
applied in the drug discovery and development process.23,24 The task is to design small molecules (receptor agonists) that will
fit to the binding pocket of the target (hydrophobic surfaces, hydrogen
bonding sites, etc.), and the binding affinity will be predicted by
a fast approximate docking program. Ligands are built up by molecular
fragments using “linkers” or “scaffolds”,
if necessary, within the constraints of the binding site in the case
of de novo method. The compounds constructed this way have to correspond
to Lipinski’s rule of five.25

Target
We proceeded from two available crystal structures
on the GDNF–GFRα1 complex downloaded from Protein Data
Bank. The hybrid structural model of reconstituted mammalian GDNF–GFRα1–RET
complex (i.e., RET ternary complex; code: 4UX8) had been derived from electron microscopy
and low-angle X-ray scattering data with a resolution of 24.0 Å.12 The protein consists of chain A and chain B
(RET; residues 29-508), chain C and chain E (GFRα1; residues
6-348), and chain D and chain F (GDNF; residues 42-134). The crystal
structure of the GDNF–GFRα1 tetrameric complex (code: 3FUB) was measured by
X-ray diffraction with a resolution of 2.35 Å.13 The asymmetric unit contains two chains of GFRα1
(chain A, residues 150-348; chain C, residues 150-348) and two chains
of GDNF (chain B, residues 40-134; chain D, residues 32-134).

Both raw crystal structures were corrected, and hydrogen atoms were
automatically added to the protein using Schrödinger’s
Protein Preparation Wizard of Maestro 10.7.26 AutoDockTools (ADT)27 1.5.6 was used
to identify the binding interface between the chains of GDNF and GFRα1.
As hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions were largely identical
in both crystal structures, thus, chains C and D of GDNF–GFRα1–RET
complex (code: 4UX8) was used for the further study. Water molecules were removed from
the crystal structure.

Small-Molecule Library
The initial
data set for virtual
fragment-based docking screening was constructed by molecular fragments
in a way that compounds would be bound to the biological target GFRα1
similarly to GDNF. Commercially available compounds based on these
structures and using Tanimoto similarity coefficient (≥80%)
were searched from ZINC17 and MolPort18 databases. The two-dimensional chemical structures
of ligands were converted into three-dimensional structures and preoptimized
by molecular mechanics MM+ field using HyperChem 8.0.28 The “Online SMILES Translator and Structure File
Generator”29 program was used to
create pdb files for molecular docking procedure.

Molecular Docking
AutoDock Vina 1.1.230 was used for the
docking studies to find out binding modes
and binding energies of ligands to the receptor. The number of rotatable
bonds of ligand was set by default by ADT.27 However, if the number was greater than 6, then some of rotatable
bonds was made as nonrotatable, otherwise calculations can be inaccurate.31 The active binding site on GFRα1, obtained
by the removal of GDNF (chain D), was surrounded with a grid box sized
30 × 30 × 30 points with a spacing of 1.000 Å. The
settings used for the iterated local search global optimizer based
on mutation and local optimization steps, accepted or rejected with
a Metropolis criterion in Vina, were nine modes, one central processing
unit, and an energy range of 1 kcal/mol. Other settings were used
as default.

Molecular Dynamics
The molecular
dynamics simulations
were carried out using Desmond simulation package of Schrödinger
LLC.32 The NPT ensemble with the temperature
of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar was applied in all runs. The simulation
lengths were 10 and 50 ns with a relaxation time of 1 ps. The OPLS_2005
force field parameters were used in all simulations.33 The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated
using the particle mesh Ewald method.34 The cutoff radius in Coulomb’ interactions was 9.0 Å.
The water molecules were described using simple point charge model.35 The Martyna–Tuckerman–Klein chain
coupling scheme36 with a coupling constant
of 2.0 ps was used for the pressure control and the Nosé–Hoover
chain coupling scheme36 for the temperature
control. Nonbonded forces were calculated using an r-RESPA integrator
where the short-range forces were updated every step and the long-range
forces were updated every three steps. The trajectories were saved
at 4.8 ps intervals for analysis. The behavior and interactions between
the ligands and protein were analyzed using the Simulation Interaction
Diagram tool implemented in Desmond molecular dynamics package. The
stability of molecular dynamics simulations was monitored by looking
on the root mean square deviation of the ligand and protein atom positions
in time.

Luciferase Assays
To identify compounds
activating
GFLs receptors and check their ability to activate intracellular signaling
via RET, we used previously developed reporter-gene-based system (MG87
murine fibroblast stably transfected with PathDetect Elk-1, GFRα1,
and RET).19 The day before the experiment,
the reporter cells were plated into 96-well plates (PerkinElmer) at

15 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1% DMSO for 4 h and stimulated with compounds
or GDNF. Then, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline containing 1 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM NaF and
lysed on ice in 0.5 mL per well of RIPA-modified buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
1% NP-40, 1% TX-100, 10% glycerol, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), 1 mM Na3VO4, 2.5 mg/mL of sodium deoxycholate,
1 mM NaF). Plates were incubated at +4 °C on the horizontal shaker
for 30 min with vigorous shaking; lysates were collected to the Eppendorf
tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at +4 °C at 13 000 rpm
to precipitate cell debris.

To immunoprecipitate RET cell lysates
were incubated overnight at +4 °C on the round rotator in the
presence of 1 μg/mL of goat anti-RET C-20 antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-1290, RRID:AB_631316) and magnetic beads
conjugated with protein G (Dynabeads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#
10004D). Beads were washed three times with 1× tris-buffered
saline (TBS) with 1% triton X-100; bound proteins were eluted by 100
μL of 2× Laemmli loading buffer, resolved on 7.5% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. Membrane was blocked for 15 min at room temperature with
TBS-T (1× TBS containing 0.15% Tween 20) containing 10% skimmed
milk and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Millipore, Cat#
05-321, RRID:AB_309678) diluted 1:1500 in TBS-T with 3% skimmed milk
for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times
for 5 min in TBS-T and incubated in the 1:1000 solution of secondary
antimouse antibodies conjugated with HRP (DAKO, Cat# P0447) diluted
in TBS-T containing 3% skimmed milk for 45 min at room temperature.
Membranes were washed with TBS-T for 4 × 10 min. Stained bands
were visualized with a Pierce ECL western blotting substrate (Cat#
32106) or SuperSignal ELISA Femto substrate (Pierce, Cat# 37075) using
LAS-3000 imaging software. To confirm, equal loading membranes were
stripped and reprobed with anti-RET C-20 antibodies (1:500) diluted
in TBS-T containing 3% skimmed milk. To detect C-20, we used secondary
antigoat antibodies conjugated with HRP (1:1500, DAKO, Cat# P0449).

Quantification of RET Phosphorylation
Quantification
of RET pY images was done using Image Studio 5.2 software. Intensities
of the bands corresponding to phosphorylated surface form of RET (MW
= 170 kDa) and total surface form of RET were first normalized to
their areas and intensity/area values for RET pY band then were normalized
to the intensity/area values of RET band. The images from 3 to 6 independent
experiments were quantified.

Statistical Analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed
by one-way or RMs ANOVA with the Dunnett’s post hoc test to
determine the significance of the differences. P values
below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
