Single-monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides exhibit exceptionally
strong photoluminescence (PL), dominated by a combination of distinct
neutral and charged exciton contributions. We show here that the surface
charge associated with ferroelectric domains patterned into a lead
zirconium titanate film with an atomic force microscope laterally
controls the spatial distribution of neutral and charged exciton populations
in an adjacent WS2 monolayer. This is manifested by the
intensity and spectral composition of the PL measured in air at room
temperature from the areas of WS2 over a ferroelectric
domain with a polarization dipole pointed either out of the surface
plane or into the surface plane. This approach enables spatial modulation
of PL intensity and trion/neutral exciton populations and fabrication
of lateral quantum dot arrays in any geometry, with potential applications
in nonvolatile optically addressable memory or optical quantum computation.

Introduction
Single-monolayer transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit
striking optical properties arising from the evolution of their band
structure to direct gap from indirect gap, which is characteristic
of two or more layers.1−4 The dielectric screening
of single-monolayer TMDs is very low due to their two-dimensional
(2D) character relative to that of bulk material because the screening
that would normally occur due to carriers in the bulk is largely absent.
Thus, their properties are strongly influenced by their immediate
environment and can be modified and controlled by variations in the
local charge density due to adsorbates5−7 or electrostatic gating,8−10 generating keen interest in a wide variety of electronic and optical
device applications.11−14

This has stimulated efforts to develop large-area synthesis
of
these single-monolayer materials using various chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) processes4,15−17 to facilitate
emerging device technologies or incorporation into van der Waals heterostructures.18 There is significant interest in using TMDs
in conventional field-effect or tunneling transistors,11,16 as well as in ferroelectric memory and photodetector applications.19−22 Although typical substrates include SiO2/Si and sapphire,
recent work has demonstrated the growth of MoS2 on periodically
poled lithium niobate wafers, with growth occurring preferentially
on only one of the two polarization domains, resulting in laterally
templated growth.23

The absorption
and luminescence of TMD monolayers are highly sensitive
to their environment, and their quantum efficiency can vary significantly
if they are placed on different substrates2 or are chemically treated.24,25 Photoluminescence (PL)
typically consists of contributions from the free exciton and the
charged exciton or trion, depending upon the environment and surface
treatment.7 Because the the exciton and
trion binding energies are very large (∼600 and ∼30
meV, respectively), these characteristic emission features persist
at room temperature. Here, we show that the intensity and spectral
composition of PL from single-monolayer WS2, measured in
air at room temperature, can be spatially controlled by the polarization
domains in an adjacent film of the ferroelectric material, lead zirconium
titanate (PZT). These domains are written and read in the PZT using
a conductive atomic force microscope (C-AFM),26 and they produce local surface charge and electric fields arising
from the polarization dipole. Because the polarization domain wall
width in a ferroelectric material can be as low as 1–10 nm,27 this approach enables spatial modulation of
the PL intensity and trion/neutral exciton populations, with potential
for nanoscale resolution. This offers spatial control over their corresponding
interactions, which have recently led, for example, to the observation
of new phenomena arising from trion coupling to localized pockets
of a 2D electron gas in WS2.28

Results and Discussion
The samples were fabricated by mechanically
transferring large-area
monolayer WS2 grown by a CVD process29 onto a 100 nm thick lead zirconium titanate (Pb[Zr0.2Ti0.8]O3) film on a conducting n-type
strontium titanate wafer. The transfer was performed using standard
techniques that have been described elsewhere30 and in the Methods section. AFM images of
the PZT film before and after transfer of the WS2 monolayer
are shown in Figures S1 and S2 (Supporting
Information), respectively.

Before transfer, a metal marker
grid pattern (Ti/Au) was deposited
onto the PZT using either a shadow mask or photolithography technique
to assist in locating specific poled areas. Polarization domains were
then written into the PZT film using a C-AFM.26 A tip voltage of ±10 V direct current (dc) was applied in the
contact mode, and 10 × 10 μm square polarization domains
were written in a checkerboard pattern. A positive tip voltage generates
polarization dipoles pointing into the sample plane and a negative
charge at the PZT surface, whereas a negative tip voltage generates
polarization dipoles pointing out of the sample plane and a positive
surface charge. The polarization domains were imaged with the same
instrument in the electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) mode, and an
EFM phase image of such an area is shown in Figure 1a. A horizontal EFM line scan averaged across
the top two poled domains is shown in Figure 1b. There is strong contrast between the 10
× 10 μm squares written with opposite AFM tip polarities,
indicating successful poling of the PZT film. There is little contrast
between the areas of PZT that were not poled by the AFM and the 10
× 10 μm squares intentionally poled with a +10 V tip bias,
due to the global poling of the entire PZT film before addressing
it with the AFM. Figure 1c schematically illustrates the orientation of the poled domains
within the PZT film and the corresponding charge distributions.

Figure 1 (a) Image of
the poled PZT surface obtained with an AFM operated
in the EFM phase mode. The same AFM was used to write the polarization
domains into the PZT in a checkerboard pattern, with the tip polarities
shown. The total image size is 30 × 30 μm, and each poled
square is 10 × 10 μm. The dashed lines are guides to the
eye, and the bias voltages applied to the C-AFM tip are indicated.

two panels of the checkerboard. (c) Schematic cross section of the
PZT film illustrating the orientation of the polarization domains
and the corresponding surface charge.

After mechanical transfer of the WS2 monolayer
onto
the poled PZT films, PL spectra were acquired in air at room temperature
with 1 μm spatial resolution using a PL microscope equipped
with both incident laser beam scanning mirrors and a stepper motor-controlled
sample stage for rastering in the xy sample plane,
permitting both single-spot and scanned-area spectral acquisition.
Four separate transfers of monolayer WS2 onto the PZT were
performed, and representative data are shown. Discrete spectra were
typically acquired at 1 μm steps in both x and y directions. A 488 nm laser was used, with an incident
power on the sample of less than 5 μW to avoid spurious effects
such as photoexcitation of free carriers and inadvertent trion formation.7 For reference, the raw PL spectra and corresponding
peak intensity map acquired from WS2 over a 30 × 30
μm region of the PZT film that was not poled with the AFM are
shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows individual
spectra acquired from the positions indicated in Figure 2b. These spectra are generally
attributed to the ground-state exciton, referred to as the “A”
exciton in the literature, and they can be fit with two Lorentzian
components, which will be discussed later. The PL intensity map in Figure 2b is reasonably uniform,
demonstrating that any inhomogeneity in either the PZT or the transferred
WS2 has a modest effect on the intensity and little effect
on the spectral distribution.

Figure 2 (a) Raw PL spectra and (b) PL peak intensity
map of these spectra
obtained from the WS2 monolayer over a 30 × 30 μm
area in the sample plane, acquired from a region of the PZT that was
not poled by AFM. The PL intensity and spectral distribution are very
uniform over this area.

Similar data acquired from the WS2 over a 30 ×
30 μm area of the PZT that was intentionally poled with the
AFM in the checkerboard pattern described above (Figure 1a) are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows typical raw PL spectra (solid black
line) obtained from the regions labeled Box 1 and Box 2 in Figure 3b, where the underlying
FE polarization dipole is pointed down into the surface plane (negative
PZT surface charge) or up out of the surface plane (positive PZT surface
charge). The spectrum from Box 1 over the “down” polarization
domain in the PZT shows a lower intensity and a markedly asymmetric
line shape, peaked at ∼1.99 eV, with a distinct low-energy
tail. In contrast, the spectrum from Box 2 over the “up”
polarization domain shows a much higher intensity and a narrower,
nearly symmetric line shape, peaked at ∼2.01 eV. Figure 3b shows a spatial map of the
peak intensities of the raw PL spectra, with significantly higher
intensities observed from Boxes 2 and 3 over the up polarization domains
than those from Boxes 1 and 4 over the down polarization domains. Figure 3c shows the spatial
variation of the raw PL line width (full width at half-maximum (FWHM)),
where the line width in Boxes 2 and 3 is markedly narrower than that
in Boxes 1 and 4. It is clear that both PL intensity and spectral
distribution are strongly modulated by the polarization domains in
the underlying PZT film, with a significantly higher intensity and
narrower line widths observed over the domains with the polarization
dipole pointing out of the sample plane (positive charge at the PZT
surface).

Figure 3 (a) Raw PL spectra (solid black line) and fits (dashed green line)
using two Lorentzians centered at 2.01 eV (red line) and 1.99 eV (blue
line), with the difference between the raw spectra and the fit shown
by the purple residual line. (b) PL peak intensity map of the raw
PL spectra obtained from the WS2 monolayer over a 30 ×
30 μm2 area in the sample plane, acquired from a
region of the PZT that was intentionally poled by AFM in the checkerboard
pattern illustrated in Figure 1a. (c) Spatial map of the raw PL line width (FWHM) corresponding
to the data from (b).

The PL spectra can be quantitatively fit using two Lorentzian
components,
shown by the red and blue lines in Figure 3a, with the fit and residual shown by green
dashed and purple solid lines, respectively. The fits are obtained
by first allowing the Lorentzian peak energy, height, and FWHM to
vary to determine the optimal peak energies, 1.99 and 2.01 eV, for
all spectra, and then allowing only the Lorentzian height and FWHM
to vary to minimize the residual for individual spectra. The PL spectra
of Box 1 (WS2 over the down polarization domain with a
negative PZT surface charge) are dominated by the lower-energy Lorentzian,
whereas the spectra of Box 2 (WS2 over the up polarization
domain with a positive PZT surface charge) are dominated by the higher-energy
component.

To understand the origin of these changes in intensity
and spectral
distribution, we begin by noting that recent work has shown that WS2 monolayers on SiO2/Si substrates can be purposefully
prepared so that their PL is dominated by either the neutral exciton,
X°, or the charged exciton, X–, consisting
of an electron bound to the exciton and referred to as a trion.7 PL from the air-exposed surface at room temperature
is dominated by emission from the neutral ground-state exciton near
2.0 eV, attributed to the presence of surface adsorbates which act
as electron acceptors. When the sample is placed in vacuum and illuminated
with a laser, the PL spectrum is dominated by the trion which appears
at a lower energy, attributed to the laser-induced desorption of these
surface adsorbates, which leave behind excess electrons to form trions.
The relative intensities of these two components are determined from
the available surface charge due to adsorbates or laser power, and
their energy positions and separation depend further on the particular
substrate, strain, and total electron density.30

We note that the down polarization domains in Boxes
1 and 4 result
in negative charge accumulation at the PZT surface, and our spectra
obtained from WS2 over these regions have a more significant
contribution from the lower-energy PL component. On the basis of the
spatial correlation of the negative surface charge with the lower-energy
PL component, reduced intensity, and broader line width, we conclude
that the PL from Boxes 1 and 4 is dominated by the trion contribution.
In contrast, the up polarization domains in Boxes 2 and 3 result in
positive surface charge accumulation at the PZT surface, and the spectra
obtained from WS2 over these regions have a more significant
contribution from the higher-energy component. On the basis of the
spatial correlation of the positive surface charge with the higher-energy
PL component, higher intensity, and narrower line width, we conclude
that the PL from Boxes 2 and 3 is dominated by the neutral exciton.
These results demonstrate that the trion to exciton population ratio
can be laterally modulated at room temperature, with a spatial resolution
determined by the polarization domains in the underlying ferroelectric
layer.

Conclusions
In
summary, reduced dielectric screening due to the single-monolayer
habit makes single-monolayer TMDs attractive as an active transport
channel for conventional field-effect transistor applications16 because the channel can be easily pinched off
by small gate voltages, enabling ultralow-power operation in a proven
and highly scalable architecture. In a similar manner, TMDs are attractive
as the channel material in ferroelectric transistors19 because the positive/negative surface charge associated
with the polarization domains effectively gates the channel conductivity.
Because these domains exhibit remnant polarization, such hybrid structures
are very promising for nonvolatile memory applications,20 with the additional advantage of large-area
optical erasing21 due to the strong optical
absorption of the direct-gap TMD monolayer: the photogenerated carriers
effectively erase the ferroelectric domain structure. As we have shown
here, the surface charge distribution in the ferroelectric layer also
dramatically affects the optical emission properties in the adjacent
TMD monolayer, enabling lateral spatial control of the luminescence
intensity and spectral composition. The lateral resolution is determined
by a combination of the ferroelectric domain wall width (∼10
nm, material dependent) and the exciton/carrier diffusion length in
the TMD, which is known to be exceedingly short due to the sub-picosecond
exciton formation times and picosecond radiative lifetimes. The ability
to purposefully design and modulate adjacent populations of trions
and neutral excitons may have implications for nonvolatile optically
addressable memory,21 single-photon emitters,31 optical quantum computation, and fabrication
of lateral quantum dot arrays in any geometry.

Methods
WS2 Monolayer Growth
Monolayer WS2 on SiO2/Si was prepared by CVD in a 2 in. tube furnace.
WO3 powder and sulfur precursors are heated to 825 °C
under a 100 sccm argon and 10 sccm hydrogen flow. Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
acid tetrapotassium salt is used as seed molecules to promote lateral
growth. This procedure has been recently shown to produce large-grain
(>20 μm) uniform-coverage monolayer WS2 that exhibits
enhanced PL.29 The monolayer nature of
the film was confirmed by Raman and PL mapping.

Transfer of
WS2 to PZT
The films were removed
from the Si/SiO2 growth substrate and transferred to the
desired wafer. In the first step of the transfer process, poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) resist (950 A4) is spun onto WS2 and
cured on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. The sample is then
submerged in buffered hydrofluoric acid (HF) to etch the oxide layer,
freeing the WS2 from the growth substrate. Once released,
the film is moved to deionized water, where it floats on the surface.
WS2 is then lifted from the water with the desired substrate.
Adhesion is improved by spinning at 2000 rpm and baking at 100 °C.
PMMA is then removed using acetone and isopropanol.

Ferroelectric
Domains
Polarization domains were written
into the PZT film using C-AFM (Park NX-10) cantilevers with dc voltages
of up to ±10 V. Two types of cantilevers were used: Cr–Pt-coated
(Multi75E, Budget Sensors) and Au-coated (PPP-NCSTAu, Nanosensors)
Si cantilevers. Similar results were obtained with both. The line-scan
densities of at least 512 lines per 10 μm were used. Dynamic
contact electrostatic force microscopy was used to image the polarization
state of the poled regions, at a frequency of 75–160 kHz.
