Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
is widely used to observe graphene
on metal substrates. However, the origin of the SEM image contrast
of graphene is not well understood. In this work, we performed in
situ SEM imaging of layer-number-controlled graphene on a Ni substrate
using a high-pass energy filter for secondary electrons. We found
that the graphene layer contrast was maximized at 15–20 eV,
corresponding to the π–σ* interband transition
in graphene. Our results indicate that the SEM image of graphene is
produced by attenuation of the electrons emitted from the metal substrate
by the monoatomic layers of graphene.

Introduction
Imaging is indispensable
for the study of atomic-layered materials.
Graphene research was accelerated by the fact that even monolayer
graphene can be observed by an optical microscope when it lies on
a 300 nm thick SiO2 film and the thickness of graphene
layers can be measured.1 Despite their
atomic thickness, graphene and other atomic-layered materials can
influence the optical index, reflectivity, or emissivity of the substrate
material. Emissivity modification of a copper surface by graphene
coverage is employed for in situ observation of chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) processes of graphene on copper.2 Although optical imaging can be carried out using conventional microscopes,
this approach severely restricts the combinations of atomic-layered
material and substrate material and the spatial resolution is limited
by the wavelength of light. By contrast, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) offers a versatility in terms of possible material combinations
and a much higher spatial resolution. Graphene imaging by SEM has
been widely used in many studies.3−8 SEM is also used for in situ imaging of graphene segregation9,10 or chemical vapor deposition (CVD)11 on
metal surfaces. Although in situ imaging of graphene segregation can
be nicely performed by low energy electron microscopy (LEEM),12−15 SEM is capable of in situ observation of graphene CVD with introduction
of hydrocarbon or alcohol gases, which is unsuitable for LEEM because
of a high voltage applied to the specimen. On the other hand, in contrast
to LEEM for which the image formation mechanism is well understood,16 the formation mechanism of secondary electron
(SE) images of atomic-layered material is complex and thus poorly
understood.17 Considering the weak interaction
between primary electrons and the atomic-layered material, the direct
SE emission from graphene should be much smaller than that from the
substrate. Nevertheless, monolayer graphene can be clearly imaged.
There are many factors that can affect the SE emission from graphene-coated
materials, such as work function, oxidation/nonoxidation, intercalation,
charging, and attenuation of SEs. It is necessary to clarify the contrast
formation mechanism and optimize the observation conditions.

In this study, we investigated the SE image contrast of graphene
on metal surfaces using layer-number-controlled specimens prepared
by segregation in the SEM chamber. We were able to optimize the contrast
between graphene and the substrate by selecting the SE energy.

Results
and Discussion
SE Image
Contrasts Depending on the Detector
The SEM instrument used
(LEO 1530 VP, Carl Zeiss) has two types of SE detectors, in-column
and out-lens detectors.18 The SE contrast
of graphene depends on the type of detector. Figure 1a–d shows in situ SE images of graphene
growing on a large Ni(111) grain surface. A supporting movie of the
graphene growth has been prepared as the Supporting Information. SE images simultaneously acquired with the in-column
and out-lens detectors are shown in the left and right parts of the
SE images, respectively. For monolayer graphene, the SE image acquired
with the in-column detector exhibits prominent edge contrast, which
accentuates the monolayer graphene on the Ni surface.9,10 The edge contrast appears as either bright (for the right edge in Figure 1) or dark (for the
upper and left edges) depending on the inclination of the substrate
surface or the nonuniformity of the detection efficiency. No
such edge contrasts appear in the SE image acquired with the out-lens
detector. Apart from the edge contrast, the brightness of the graphene-coated
region is almost the same as that of the bare Ni surface. On the other
hand, the graphene-coated regions appear more clearly, as a darker
contrast. The even darker area seen in Figure 1d is the second layer of graphene segregated
underneath the first layer. Although this second layer can also be
recognized in the SE image acquired with the in-column detector, the
contrast is less prominent and the edge contrast is absent. The differences
in the SE images of graphene between the two types of detectors presumably
stem from the difference in the energy ranges detected. Lower energy
SEs are mainly collected by the in-column detector, whereas the remaining
higher energy portion is collected by the out-lens detector.18 To determine the effect of SE energy on graphene
contrast, we performed energy-filtered imaging by adding an energy
filter into the specimen stage.

Figure 1 In situ SE imaging of the graphene segregation
process on a wide
Ni(111) grain surface observed at ≈800 °C. SE images simultaneously
acquired with the in-column (left half) and out-lens (right half)
detectors are shown. During observation, two domains of monolayer
graphene proceeded from the left and right ends of the view field
as seen in (a) and (b), and merged in the center in (c). The second
layer appeared in (d). The labels Ni, ML, and BL in the left images
in (a) and (d) denote nickel, monolayer, and bilayer, respectively.

Energy-Filtered
SE Images of Graphene
SEs were acquired with the in-column
detector through an aperture 3 mm in diameter, set 4 mm above the
specimen surface (see Figure S1). The filter
can generate a retarding electric field between the specimen and detector,
thus acting as a high-pass filter of the SE energy.

Figure 2 shows the retarding
voltage dependence of SE images of graphene on the polycrystalline
Ni surface observed at ≈800 °C. The contrast settings
of the in-column detector were the same for all images. The brightness
of each image in Figure 2 was adjusted so that the brightness of the Ni surface appeared the
same for all of the retarding voltages. Figure 2a highlights monolayer, bilayer, trilayer
(three layers), and tetralayer (four layers) graphene-coated regions
with red, green, dark blue, and light blue shading, respectively.
On a large crystal grain (center of the SEM images), there are monolayer,
bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer graphene regions on the surface
at the initial stage. Because in situ imaging was performed at ≈800
°C, graphene segregation continued, causing a shape change while
the retarding voltage was increased. At 0 V, similar to the SE images
under ordinary conditions (Figure 1), monolayer graphene appears slightly darker than
the bare Ni surface and the graphene-coated region becomes darker
with increasing number of layers. At 5 V, where electrons with energies
higher than 5 eV are going through the filter and being detected,
monolayer graphene becomes slightly brighter than the bare Ni surface.
The contrast between monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer
graphene is very small. At 15 V, monolayer graphene becomes clearly
darker than Ni and bilayer and thicker multilayer graphene films appear
much darker than monolayer graphene, resulting in clear layer contrasts.
At 25 V and higher, although the graphene-coated regions are darker
than Ni, the contrast between layers is smaller than that at 15 V.
The edge contrast of monolayer graphene is not so prominent even at
0 V and disappears at 10 V and higher voltages.

Figure 2 Energy-filtered SE images
of graphene on polycrystalline Ni observed
at ≈800 °C. Panel (a) highlights graphene-coated regions
by shading with different colors for the different numbers of layers.
Monolayer: red, bilayer: green, trilayer: dark blue, and tetralayer:
light blue. The retarding voltages were (b) 0 V, (c) 5 V, (d) 15 V,
(e) 25 V, and (f) 35 V.

To quantify the contrast change, we digitalized the brightness
of graphene SE images and plotted the retarding voltage dependence
of the SE image brightness for monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer
graphene, as shown in Figure 3a. The image brightness shows a maximum around 3–10
V and rapidly decreases with increasing the retarding voltage, but
detailed behaviors are different between the bare Ni surface and graphene-coated
surfaces. The brightness increases at voltages lower than 3 V, which
seems unusual as energy distribution of SEs. This might be due to
the fact that the acceptance angle of the in-column detector for emitted
SEs changes with the SE energy. The collection efficiency of the in-column
detector is especially high for the lower energy SEs. To compensate
for the collection efficiency of the detector and to elucidate the
difference in the graphene layer contrast, the data in Figure 3a are normalized relative to
Ni and shown in Figure 3b. It can be seen that the brightness of monolayer graphene is maximized
at 3 V and minimized at around 15 V. For thicker layers, although
the maxima and minima shift to slightly higher voltages depending
on the number of layers, their behavior is similar to that of monolayer
graphene. More importantly, the difference in brightness between the
mono-, bi-, and trilayers is maximized at around 15 V. The contrast
between the bi-, tri-, and tetralayers is smaller for all voltages.
Such voltage-dependent contrast changes cannot be explained simply
by the work function difference between the films of varying layer
numbers.19

Origin
of Graphene SE Image Contrasts
Given that most of the SEs
are emitted from the Ni substrate, the fact that the graphene layer
contrast is maximized at a retarding voltage of around 15 V means
that the attenuation of SEs by graphene is maximized here. Furthermore,
the smaller brightness difference for thicker layers indicates that
SEs from the substrate are mostly suppressed by the graphene layers.
Thus, the behavior shown in Figure 3b likely reflects the energy dependence of the inelastic
mean free path (IMFP) of SEs.

To confirm this interpretation,
we extracted the attenuation length from the data shown in Figure 3a. Because the data
in Figure 3a represent
the integrals of SE intensities over each retarding voltage, we calculated
the SE intensity at a certain energy I(E) as the numerical differentiation using the brightness of adjacent
retarding voltages  where V is the retarding
voltage at E = eV, e is the elementary charge, ΔV is the retarding
voltage increment (=1 V), and N(V) is the brightness measured at retarding
voltage V. Thus, we can obtain the attenuation length
λ(E) of an electron through graphene via  where n is the number of graphene layers, d is the graphene interlayer spacing (0.34 nm), and I0 is the SE intensity generated from the Ni
substrate. Here, we assume that the effect of graphene layers on the
penetration of primary electrons (1.45 keV) is negligible so that I0 is constant for n = 1–4. Figure 4 shows the energy
dependence of the electron attenuation length induced by the graphene
layers. The data derived from different number of graphene layers
follow almost the same energy dependence. The minimum value, 0.6–1.0
nm, appears at ≈20 eV, which qualitatively agrees with the
IMFP of electrons in solids,20 although
the scatter in the data becomes large owing to the small SE intensities
in the higher energy region, where the attenuation length might be
overestimated. The difference between the attenuation length minimum
≈20 eV (Figure 4) and the brightness minimum ≈15 eV (Figure 3b) is caused by the fact that the brightness
in Figure 3 represents
the integrals of SE intensities over each retarding voltage. Because
the brightness at a certain retarding voltage includes SEs with energies
higher than the retarding energy, the brightness is minimized at a
voltage lower than 20 V.

Figure 4 Attenuation length of electrons derived from
data in Figure 3a.

The minimum attenuation length
should be related to the maximum
probability of inelastic scattering of electrons, i.e., the most probable
energy loss process in graphene. This corresponds to the energy loss
peak due to the π–σ* interband transition in graphene.21 For a suspended graphene, the π–σ*
interband transition energy is ≈15 eV but the energy can be
altered by the interaction between the substrate and graphene. The
energy loss peak at ≈20 eV is actually observed for graphene
on Ni.22 It should be noted that the energy
loss peak at ≈15 eV for suspended graphene is often referred
to as π+σ plasmon;22,23 most SEs have a momentum
nearly perpendicular to the graphene plane and excite the π–σ*
interband transition rather than inplane vibration of electrons in
graphene.21

The cause of the peculiar
edge contrast of monolayer graphene on
the Ni surface remains unclear. The present energy filtering results
provide some clues. The edge contrast disappeared at higher retarding
voltages (>10 V), suggesting that the edge contrast was created
by
lower energy SEs. For the in-column detector of the Gemini column,
the accepting range of the takeoff angle of SEs depends on the SE
energy.24 The detector accepts SEs emitted
with a wide range of takeoff angles, including those emitted with
small takeoff angles (i.e., nearly parallel to the specimen surface)
in the case of lower energy SEs. With increasing energy, the lower
limit of the detectable takeoff angle of SEs increases. Thus, if the
edge contrast is generated by lower energy SEs emitted with small
takeoff angles, it is reasonable for the edge contrast to disappear
at higher retarding voltages. In addition, the energy filter can affect
the selectivity for takeoff angle, resulting in a less clear edge
contrast, as seen in Figure 2.

Application
to SE Imaging of Graphene on Cu
The graphene contrast on
a bare Cu surface is also maximized at a retarding voltage of ≈20
eV. Figure 5 shows
SE images of graphene islands nucleated on polycrystalline Cu observed
at retarding voltages of 0 and 20 V. On a bare Cu surface, the graphene
contrast is very faint in the absence of an applied retarding voltage.25 By contrast, under a retarding voltage, monolayer
graphene islands appear much darker than the Cu surface, which makes
graphene observation easier. Graphene on Cu also shows an energy loss
peak at ≈20 eV.26 This result confirms
that the main origin of graphene SE contrast formation on metal surfaces
is the graphene-induced attenuation of SEs generated in the metal
substrate.

at ≈800 °C with retarding voltages of (a) 0 V and (b)
20 V.

Conclusions
We
performed energy-filtered SE imaging of graphene with controlled
layer numbers utilizing in situ graphene segregation. We found that
the SE contrast of graphene on Ni and Cu surfaces was maximized at
retarding voltages of 15–20 V. In this voltage range, the layer
contrast between monolayer and bilayers of graphene was also maximized.
This was explained by the energy dependence of graphene-induced attenuation
of SEs generated in the metal substrate. The maximum attenuation corresponds
to the π–σ* interband transition in the electronic
states of graphene. This method is generally useful for observing
atomically thin films on metal substrates.

Experimental
Section
Graphene was synthesized by segregation on the Ni
surface at elevated
temperatures. We used an SEM instrument (LEO 1530 VP, Carl Zeiss)
and modified the specimen stage to allow resistive heating by passing
a direct current (dc) through the specimen. Thus, the SEM instrument
could be used for in situ observation of graphene formation during
segregation. The Ni specimen used was a 0.1 mm thick Ni (>99%)
foil
whose surface was mechanically polished. The foil was cut into a 0.3
× 20 mm2 piece for heating to ≈1000 °C
with a dc of ≈5 A in the SEM chamber. Before in situ SEM observation,
the specimen was annealed at 950 °C in an Ar/H2 (3%
H2 by volume) mixture gas in a quartz furnace to enlarge
the Ni grains. Then, a carbon film (in the form of disordered graphite)
was deposited by using ethanol vapor supplied by bubbling Ar/H2 gas (total pressure of 800 Pa) through liquid ethanol at
900 °C for 20 min. During in situ observations, we estimated
the specimen temperature on the basis of the behavior of graphene,
which either dissolved (>900 °C) or underwent monolayer and
multilayer
segregation (≈790–900 °C), according to previous
studies.27,28 The vacuum pressure of the specimen chamber
was ≈7 × 10–3 Pa by pumping with a turbomolecular
pump. Although this was not an ultrahigh vacuum, contamination of
the specimen surface during observation was negligible at the elevated
temperatures. To avoid the effect of contamination, all of the observations
were done at the elevated temperatures.

The LEO 1530 VP has
two types of SE detectors: (i) the so-called
in-column detector set in the Gemini column,18 and (ii) a normal E–T detector29 (out-lens detector). The former collects lower energy SEs being
intercepted by the weak electrical field of the objective lens, whereas
the latter collects the remaining high energy SEs.18 In addition, we installed an energy filter on the specimen
stage to measure the energy dependence of the SE contrast. As shown
in Figure S1, SEs were acquired with the
in-column detector through a 3 mm diameter aperture set 4 mm above
the specimen. The electrode with aperture was capable of applying
a retarding electric field on the SEs emitted from the specimen. The
minimum SE energy was determined by the retarding voltage, acting
as a high-pass filter of SE energy. The primary electron energy was
1.45 keV.
