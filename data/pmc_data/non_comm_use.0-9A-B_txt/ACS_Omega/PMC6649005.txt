Nowadays, most of the commonly used
superabsorbent polymers (SAPs)
are derived from synthetic polymers, particularly acrylic acid and
its copolymers made with acrylamide. Here, we describe a novel and
environmentally friendly aqueous-based process for fabrication of
a new, natural, cellulose-based SAP (hydrogel). In this two-step process,
cellulose was first reacted with sodium monochloroacetate (MCA) to
obtain carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and then cross-linked with epichlorohydrin
(ECH). In distilled water (d-water), the water retention value (WRV)
of the newly fabricated hydrogels reached 725 g d-water/g gel, which
is significantly greater than any other commercially available superabsorbent
cellulose-based material (WRV of 10–100 g/g) and comparable
to the commercial synthetic (polyacrylate) SAP gels (WRV of up to
1000 g/g). In saline water (s-water; 0.9% NaCl), the maximum WRV attained
was 118 g s-water/g gel, which exceeds more than 2-fold the WRV of
commercial gels (40–50 g/g). Compositional analysis was carried
out to determine the amount of carboxyl groups and average molecular
mass, and the parameters for hydrogel preparation were optimized.
The natural SAP was characterized using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction
(XRD). The hydrogels showed good re-swelling properties losing only
5–10% of their capabilities to reabsorb d-water when reused
in four consecutive cycles. Because of their superior swelling properties
in physiological saline, the new hydrogels can compete with their
synthetic counterparts in applications such as high-value hygiene
and biomedical products.

1 Introduction
Cross-linked networks
of polymer chains with a three-dimensional
linear or branched structure, which can absorb and retain significant
amounts of water, are termed superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) or hydrogels.1,2 The high water absorption potential of hydrogels is due to the presence
of hydrophilic functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.
Because of their hydrophilic nature and ability to swell, hydrogels
are broadly used in personal hygiene products,3,4 agriculture,5 biomedical applications,6,7 heavy
metal removal,8,9 and drug delivery.10,11 Currently, most of the commercially available hydrogels are cross-linked
synthetic polymers, such as polyacrylic acid and acrylic acid-acrylamide-derived
copolymers.12−16 The water intake potential of these SAPs is up to 1000 times of
their weight (1000 g water/g SAP).17

Hydrogels are normally insoluble in water due to their cross-linked
structure and large molecular weight. However, water absorption takes
place within the hydrogel matrix, which causes water retention and
swelling that are controlled to a great extent by the cross-linking
density and the charge groups resided in the hydrogel molecules.18 The greater the charge of the SAPs, the greater
their water absorption capacity in both s-water and pure d-water.

Biodegradability and biocompatibility along with insignificant
toxicity are the prime characteristics of renewable bio-based hydrogels
such as cellulose-derived superabsorbents.19−22 However, most of the hydrogels
currently available on the market are mainly based on petroleum-derived
acrylic acid and acrylamide, which are of oil-based nonrenewable nature.
In addition, some natural polymers, such as carboxyalkyl cellulose,
gum, carboxyalkyl starch, and cellulose sulfate may contain a portion
of grafted polymeric particles from polyacrylates, sulfonated polystyrene,
and poly(vinyl alcohol).23,24 These types of “mixed”
superabsorbent materials of the renewable/nonrenewable origin are
capable of absorbing 10–100 g d-water/g hydrogel, which is
significantly lower than the water intake potential of synthetic SAPs
(1000 g d-water/g SAP).17,23,24

In search for new and fully bio-based hydrogels, renewable
and
biodegradable polymers such as cellulose have been extensively studied
as a raw material for SAPs.25−28 Cellulose-based hydrogels prepared by cross-linking
with succinic anhydride via etherification were shown to absorb 400
times of the gel’s dry weight.29 A SAP prepared by cross-linking co-dissolved carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl
cellulose with divinyl sulfone denoted a maximum water absorbency
of 425 g d-water/g material.30 Alam and
Christopher31 reported a natural cellulose-chitosan
cross-linked hydrogel that was able to absorb up to 610 g d-water/g
gel. However, all cellulose-based superabsorbent materials reported
to date suffer from inferior water absorbency and production costs
compared to their synthetic counterparts.

The objective of this
work was to develop a new and completely
renewable cellulose-based hydrogel with improved swelling and re-swelling
capabilities that could compete with synthetic SAPs of environmental
concern. The new hydrogel was prepared using two inexpensive and biodegradable
materials: CMC and ECH. The two-step fabrication process is aqueous-based,
eco-friendly, and catalyst-free and does not require any energy-intensive
post-purification step rather than a simple water washing of the hydrogel.
Here, we described the process and its advantages and the properties
of the newly prepared hydrogel and its potential applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Cross-linking
of Hydrogels
The CMC coupling reaction with ECH is presented
in Figure 1. Cross-linking
occurred between
the epoxy group of ECH and the hydroxyl group in CMC (at any position)
via an ether bond. This reaction takes place in an alkaline condition
(in the presence of NaOH) without a catalyst, with NaCl and water
that are the only co-products. As NaCl is highly soluble in water,
it can be easily washed out from the hydrogel once the reaction is
complete.

Figure 1 Cross-linking reaction of CMC with ECH used for hydrogel preparation.

The composition and properties
of the new hydrogels are shown in Table 1. The first two columns
of Table 1 provide
information about the initial concentrations of CMC and ECH in weight
percent used for the hydrogel preparation. Although the weight ratio
of CMC to ECH in the resulting hydrogels was kept at 0.75, the initial
concentrations of CMC and ECH had a profound impact on the gel’s
composition (carboxyl content) and properties, such as average molar
mass (Mc) and WRV (Table 1). Best results in terms of water absorbency
were obtained with 3 wt % CMC and 4 wt % ECH: the WRV of the hydrogel
reached 725 g d-water/g gel water and 118 g s-water/g gel (Table 1). The gels having
higher water absorbency are better suited for water absorption applications.
Increasing the CMC concentration above 3 wt % resulted in reduction
of gel’s WRV, Mc, and carboxyl
content. This can be explained with the state of the macromolecular
network formed at different initial cellulose concentrations. The
gel’s cross-linked network is characterized by the availability
of capillary spaces and the cross-linking density (CD). The use of
higher CMC concentrations increased the CD (decreased Mc) of the forming gel, which resulted in a decrease of
the absorption potential and WRV values. The denser cross-linked structure
effectively screened the gel’s internal matrix from the flux
of incoming water, which limited cellulose hydration. On the other
hand, cross-linking of CMC at concentrations lower than 3 wt % produced
very weak gels with a changeable physical condition that could not
keep water, hence lowering the WRV (Table 1). Therefore, cross-linking plays an important
role in the formation and manipulation of the properties of superabsorbent
gels. The cross-linking density and swelling capacity of gels can
be modified by varying the amount of cross-linker. Moreover, the degree
of cross-linking impacts the integrity, strength, swelling, and hygroscopicity
of gels.32 Different weight ratios of CMC
to ECH in the resulting hydrogels have also been studied, and the
corresponding obtained results are provided in Table 1.

a CMC containing
3.5 mmol of COOH
groups/g cellulose.

The
occurrence of the carboxymethylation reaction was confirmed
by 13C solid-state NMR and FTIR investigations. Figure 2a displays the 13C NMR spectra of unmodified and modified cellulose. The unmodified
cellulose exhibited carbon peaks at C1 (105 ppm), C4 (85 ppm), C2,
C3, and C5 (74 ppm), and C6 (65 ppm), which are all typical of cellulose
I.33 On the other hand, a new peak at 173
ppm appeared in the 13C NMR spectra of the CMC samples
confirmed the presence of the newly introduced COOH groups.33 The FTIR spectra of unmodified cellulose, CMC,
and the new cross-linked hydrogel are exhibited in Figure 2. In the case of unmodified
cellulose, the characteristic absorption peaks at 3300 and 2900 cm–1 correspond to O–H and C–H stretching
vibrations, respectively.34 The same peaks
can be seen for CMC and the CMC–ECH cross-linked gel. In addition,
the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) group is evident from the
peak at 1740 cm–1, which confirms the successful
introduction of carbonyl groups (Figure 2). This result also confirms the presence
of COOH groups in the CMC and hydrogel. A new peak at 1328 cm–1 in the cross-linked gel demonstrates the successful
ether-based cross-linking of CMC with ECH.35

cellulose cross-linked hydrogels.

2.2 Swelling Properties of Hydrogels
The time course of the WRV of the cellulose hydrogel obtained from
3 g/L CMC cross-linked with 4 g/L ECH (Table 1) in d- and s-water is shown in Figure 3. The WRV in d-water
increased rapidly and reached to 400 g d-water/g gel in 2 h. Afterward,
the water absorption rate became slower, and the equilibrium WRV of
725 g d-water/g gel was attained at 40 h (2400 min). The WRV of the
modified cellulose hydrogel in s-water also increased sharply to reach
74 g s-water/g gel in the first 40 min. Thereafter, the absorption
rate levelled off, with an equilibrium WRV of 118 g s-water/g gel
obtained after 2400 min. The obtained WRV values for this modified
cellulose hydrogel (cross-linked by ECH) in d- and s-water are larger
than any other cellulose-derived hydrogels reported in the literature
(400 g d-water/g cellulose-based hydrogels cross-linked with succinic
anhydride;29 425 g d-water/g cross-linking
co-dissolved carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose with divinyl sulfone;30 610 g d-water/g cellulose-chitosan cross-linked
hydrogel31). One disadvantage of the cellulose-based
absorbent materials is their lower water absorbency (in d-water) compared
to that of the commercial synthetic SAP (∼1000 g d-water/g
gel).12,36 This work reports the WRVs of cellulose-based
hydrogels in d-water that are comparable to the water absorbencies
of commercial SAPs. Furthermore, our fabricated cellulose-based hydrogel
demonstrated a significantly better WRV in s-water (118 g/g gel) compared
to the commercial SAP (40–50 g/g).12,29,31

Figure 3 WRV of hydrogel obtained from 3 g/L CMC cross-linked
with 4 g/L
ECH as a function of time.

The water absorption capacity of the fabricated hydrogel
following
four consecutives re-swelling cycles is exhibited in Figure 4. The WRV of the hydrogel in
the second cycle decreased only 5–10% as compared to the first
cycle, which is probably due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between
−COOH and −OH groups during the first cycle. However,
the water absorbencies of the hydrogel in cycles 3 and 4 did not change
further and remained similar to the WRV for the cycle 2.

Figure 4 WRV of best
absorbing hydrogel (obtained from 3 g/L CMC cross-linked
with 4 g/L ECH) following four consecutive re-swelling cycles.

The water absorbency of the gel
strongly depends on the type of
salt present in the water. The effect of the ion types on the swelling
ability of the modified cellulose hydrogel cross-linked by ECH is
shown in Table 2. As
shown here, the equilibrium swelling capacity Ws of the gel in the presence of monovalent cations decreased
in the following descending order: NH4+ >
K+ > Na+ (Table 2). This can be explained by the fact that
the charge
screening effect of these cations on the Ws values decreased in the same order. In the presence of salts with
different cationic charges, the absorption capacity of the hydrogel
declined in the order monovalent > divalent > trivalent cations.

Apparently, the degree of
cross-linking in the gel was influenced
by the cation charge of the salt dissolved in water. Additional cross-linking
points were formed due to the physicochemical interaction of the divalent
(Ca2+) and trivalent (Al3+) cations with the
carboxylate groups present in the hydrogel matrix.37 This caused a decrease in the gel swelling capacity. Table 2 also demonstrates
that the salt sensitivity factor f was in reverse
proportion to Ws as lower f values corresponded to higher Ws values.

2.3 Crystalline Properties of Hydrogels
The
crystallinity of the best absorbing hydrogel (WRV of 725 g d-water/g
gel and 118 g s-water/g gel, Table 1) was investigated by XRD, and the results are displayed
in Figure 5. The typical
peaks of cellulose were assigned according to Nishiyama et al.38 and Isogai et al.39 The 2θ angles of 15.3°, 16.5°, and 22.6° correspond
to the (110), (110), and (200) peaks, which are typical of cellulose
Iβ. Using eq 5,
the C.I. of the unmodified cellulose was determined to be 73%. Following
cellulose modification to CMC and hydrogels, the C.I. decreased to
52 and 56%. This suggests that some crystalline regions in cellulose
were also modified in addition to the amorphous region. The peaks
for modified (CMC) and cross-linked cellulose (hydrogel) look very
similar (Figure 5).
The slight shift of both peaks toward left from the peak for unmodified
cellulose may be due to a partial conversion of cellulose I to cellulose
II during the carboxymethylation reaction.

hydrogels.

2.4 Morphological
Properties of Hydrogels
The optical microscopic images of
the unmodified and modified CMC
cellulose fibers are exhibited in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The fiber diameter is
enlarged due to the electrostatic repulsions caused by the carboxylate
anions (−COO−) obtained from the ionization of the carboxyl
groups (−COOH) following carboxymethylation (Figure 6a,b). The plain (control) fibers
presented in Figure 6c are the unmodified cellulose fibers. The carboxymethylation reaction
did not convert all hydroxyl groups (−OH) to carboxylmethyl
groups (−OCH2–COOH), and some −OH
groups remained intact in the modified cellulose. This can explain
the two types of fibers that can be seen from Figure 6d: (1) fibers that have a lower degree of
carboxymethylation (similar to the unmodified control fibers—images
on Figure 6a,c) and
(2) modified fibers that are highly carboxymethylated (see images
for unmodified cellulose fibers from Figure 6b).

and (b) modified CMC
fibers; SEM images of (c) unmodified and (d) modified CMC fibers;
SEM image of (e) 50-fold and (f) 500-fold magnified best absorbing
cross-linked hydrogel (WRVs of 725 g d-water/g gel and 118 g s-water/g
gel).

The magnified cross-sectional
SEM images of the best absorbing
hydrogel can be observed in Figure 6e,f. The hydrogel is highly porous with a macroporous
architecture. This suggests that the electrostatic repulsions caused
by the ionic charge of the carboxylate anions (COO–) in the hydrogel have increased the space of the cross-linked hydrogel
network. The SEM image shows that the gel has an open porous geometry
with a pore size in the range of 300–600 μm, which is
separated by sheet-like walls and ultrathin structures, as revealed
in Figure 6f. The high
porosity of the hydrogels would facilitate rapid mass penetration,
which is useful in superabsorbent applications.

2.5 Potential Applications of Hydrogels
The new hydrogels
hold promise for use as “green superabsorbents”
owing to their biodegradable constituents and the eco-friendly cross-linking
process employed for their fabrication. The hydrogel was fabricated
by a straightforward reaction between CMC and ECH that are both biodegradable,
relatively inexpensive, and largely available. This will have a positive
impact on the hydrogel production cost. Because of the high absorption
capacity of the new hydrogels and in particular, their superb absorbing
potential in s-water, they could be suitable for applications such
as diapers, feminine hygiene products, wound dressings, meat soaking
pads, wiping papers, etc. This material could also serve as a feedstock
for development of advanced bioabsorbents with new properties and
applications.

3 Conclusions
A novel
hydrogel has been prepared from cellulose as a renewable
material with the objective of improving the inferior liquid absorption
performance of bio-based superabsorbents currently available on the
market. The process for fabrication of the new hydrogels is eco-friendly
as it utilizes two inexpensive and biodegradable organic compounds,
CMC and ECH. The raw material for CMC, bleached kraft pulp, was used
without prior removal of the hemicellulose, which translates into
a significant yield and cost advantages. In addition, no catalyst,
pre- or post-purification, was required to produce the hydrogel. Although
a maximum d-water absorbency of 725 g d-water/g gel attained was still
lower than that of the commercial synthetic SAPs (1000 g d-water/g
SAP), it was significantly larger than any other superabsorbent cellulosic
material reported in the literature. However, the maximum absorbency
of 118 g s-water/g gel of the gel in s-water exceeded approximately
2.5 times the WRV of commercially available synthetic SAPs (40–50
g s-water/g SAP). Furthermore, the new hydrogels demonstrated excellent
re-swelling potential as only 5–10% of the maximum water absorption
capacity was lost after four consecutive times of gel recycling and
reuse. The swelling properties of the gel can be controlled by CD, Mc, carboxyl groups, and cationic charge. Because
of their green nature and superior absorption capacity, especially
in physiological saline solution, the newly developed hydrogels may
be able to compete with synthetic SAPs in personal hygiene, pharmaceuticals,
food applications, and other novel applications.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
A kraft pulp mill in Canada
supplied bleached softwood kraft pulp. Sodium monochloroacetate (MCA),
epichlorohydrin (ECH), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) were supplied by
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Whitby, Ontario, Canada). All chemicals
were used as received.

4.2 Preparation of CMC
The carboxymethylation
reaction was carried out in aqueous (water) media according to a previously
reported method.40 Air-dried BSWK pulp
(50 g) was mixed with 230 g of MCA solution (100 g of MCA in 130 g
of water) in a Hobart mixer at room temperature for 10–15 min
and then transferred into a Nalgene bottle. The Nalgene bottle was
placed in a 50 °C preheated water bath for 4 h to allow impregnation
of MCA into the fiber interior. Thereafter, a solution of NaOH (62.5
g of NaOH in 100 g of water) was added to the reaction mixture and
agitated for 10–15 min in the Hobart mixer. The reaction was
allowed to proceed overnight (12 h) at room temperature. After completing
the reaction, the pulp was washed by 60 vol % ethanol, which assisted
in coagulation and filtration of the cellulose fibers out of the pulp
mixture. Finally, the CMC fibers were washed with 70% ethanol twice
and dried at 50 °C in an oven.

4.3 Preparation
of Hydrogels
Three weight-based
CMC/ECH ratios of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.5 were maintained during hydrogel
preparation. Different weight percent concentrations of CMC and ECH
(Table 1) were added
to a 6 wt % NaOH solution to form a cellulose suspension. For example,
to prepare a hydrogel that had WRVs of 118 g s-water/g gel and 725
g d-water/g gel, 3 wt % CMC (containing 3.5 mmol of COOH groups/g
cellulose) was mixed with 4 wt % ECH and 93 wt % of NaOH (at 6 wt
% concentration). The suspension was stirred until the CMC fibers
were fully mixed with the NaOH solution. ECH (Table 1) was then added slowly into the mixture
and stirred at 100 rpm and room temperature for 20–30 min until
the liquid turned into a highly viscous gel. The viscous gel was transferred
into a heated bath at a temperature of 50 °C and allowed to perform
the cross-linking reaction for 4–5 h. Thereafter, the cross-linked
gel was diced into cubes (1 × 1 cm), immersed into excess d-water,
and thoroughly washed to remove excess ECH. The d-water was changed
several times until the water conductivity reached 700 S/cm. Finally,
the gel was dried in an oven at 50–60 °C and then ground
in a lab-scale, high-speed grinder to a particle size of 400–600
μm.

4.4 Characterization of Hydrogels
The
carboxyl content of the CMC fibers and the cross-linked gels was determined
using a conductometric titration method31,41 with a METER
pH/conductivity S470-KIT (Mettler Toledo GmbH, Greifensee, Switzerland)
titrator. A certain amount of CMC fibers and cross-linked gels (with
a solid content of ∼20 mg dry basis) and 2.5 mL of 0.02 M sodium
chloride solution were added, and the mixture was sufficiently stirred
to prepare a well-dispersed solution. Then, 0.1 M HCl was slowly added
to the mixture to set the pH to 3. Then, the suspension was titrated
with a 0.01 M NaOH solution at a rate of 0.1 mL/min until the mixture
reached pH 11. The carboxyl group content of CMC fibers and the cross-linked
gels was determined from the conductivity curves using the following
equation (eq 1)31 1  where [COOH]g is
the carboxyl content of the CMC fibers or the cross-linked gels in
mmol/g, VNaOH is the volume of NaOH (mL)
required for deprotonation of the carboxylic groups, MNaOH is the molarity of NaOH (mol/L), and DWg is the weight (g) of the dry CMC fibers/gels initially dissolved
in d-water.

The water retention value (WRV) of the cross-linked
gels was measured by immersing the gels in d-water or 0.9 wt % NaCl
aqueous solution (s-water). The swelling gels were withdrawn from
the solution at each time interval and weighed out after removing
the excess liquid from the surface of the gel. Excess d-water (or
s-water) was removed by filtration using a 20 μm mesh nylon
cloth. The free swell WRV, a measure of the dynamic water absorption
properties of the gel, was calculated using eq 2(31,34) 2  where Wt is the weight of the wet gel
at time t and Wd is the
weight of the dried gel.

To measure the water re-swelling kinetics,
the hydrogel was first
bone-dried in an oven at 50 °C for 12 h. Thereafter, 0.2 g of
the dried gel was soaked in 200 mL of d-water at room temperature
for up to 180 min. The WRV of the swollen gel was then measured according
to eq. 2. The drying-soaking
operation, described above, represented one re-swelling cycle. This
re-swelling cycle was repeated four times using the same hydrogel.

The cross-linking density (CD) of the hydrogel is provided by the
average molar mass (Mc) that is entrapped
between any two cross-linking points contained in the gel. The CD
value is inversely proportional to Mc,
therefore, the higher the Mc, the lower
the CD. The Mc value of any hydrogel can
be calculated using a previously developed method42 based on the Flory–Huggins theory43 3  where Q is
the equilibrium water absorption of the hydrogels, D2 is the density of the hydrogels, V1 is the molar volume of the solvent used for swelling, and X1 is the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter
between solvents and hydrogels. Here, we assumed (as per the literature31) a density of 1.5 g/cm3 of the hydrogel
(density of cellulose) and X1 = 0 because
the volume fraction of methanol in water was 0 (the Flory–Huggins
interaction parameter comes from the volume fractions of methanol
in the methanol/water mixture).

The influence of ions (cations
and anions obtained from NaCl, KCl,
NH4Cl, CaCl2, and AlCl3 salts) on
the swelling capability of hydrogels (for 40 h) was studied as described
by Rodrigues et al.44 The dimensionless
salt sensitivity factor (f) was calculated31,34 as follows (eq 4) 4  where Ws and Ww is the
equilibrium swelling
capacity in s- and d-water, respectively. All salts were used at concentrations
of 0.08, 0.11, and 0.15 mol/L.

The particle size was measured
with an optical microscope (Olympus
CKX41, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Solid-state 13C NMR
spectra of the samples were obtained on a Varian/Agilent VNMRS-400
instrument operating at 100.5 MHz. Samples were packed uniformly inside
a 7.5 mm zirconium rotor and spun at 5500 Hz. Spinning sidebands were
suppressed using the TOSS sequence.

Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of
the samples were performed on an FTIR spectrometer using a Bruker
Tensor 37 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) with a PIKE MIRacle Diamond
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. Solid samples were placed
directly on the ATR crystal. The maximum pressure was applied by lowering
the tip of the pressure clamp using a rachet-type clutch mechanism.
The sample spectra of all 32 scans were averaged (from 550 to 4000
cm–1) with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

The crystalline properties of the cross-linked gels were
examined
by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The measurements were performed on a X′Pert
Pro diffractometer (PANalytical B.V., Netherlands) with a PIXcel detector
and Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The X-ray diffractograms
were acquired with a 2θ (Bragg angle) range of 10°–30°
at a scan rate of 0.005° s–1.

The crystallinity
index (C.I.) of cellulose was calculated from
the XRD spectra as follows41 5  where I200 is the intensity of the (200) plane reflection, typically
located around 2θ = 22.6°, and IAM is the intensity at 2θ = 18°, corresponding to the minimum
in a diffractogram.44

Morphological
changes in cellulose fibers were studied using Hoffman
modulation contrast optical microscopy (HMC, Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U,
Tokyo, Japan) and Hitachi Su-70 field emission scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Hitachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan). A few drops of 0.01% (w/v)
toluidine blue solution were added to the fiber sample suspension
at least 30 min prior to imaging for an optical microscopy measurement.
For the SEM measurement, the gels were swollen to equilibrium in d-
or s-water at 23 °C and neutral pH for 24 h and then freeze-dried
using a LABCONCO FreeZone 2.5 instrument (LABCONCO, Kansas City, USA).
The freeze-dried samples were placed on double-sided carbon adhesive
discs attached to aluminum specimen stubs and then sputter-coated
with gold to improve specimen conductivity. The images were taken
at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.
