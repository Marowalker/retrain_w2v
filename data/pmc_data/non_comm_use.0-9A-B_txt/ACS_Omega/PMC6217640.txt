Hypochlorous
(OCl–) acid is the most well-known
bacterial oxidant to be produced by neutrophils. Excess amounts of
OCl– can cause various disorders in living systems.
Herein, we have designed, synthesized, and characterized two novel
organoselenium-based target molecules (Probe-1 and Probe-OCl) based on a synthetic intermediate of mycophenolic
acid for the aqueous detection of OCl–. Probe 1 has been recently reported (Org. Lett. 2018, 20, 3557–3561);
both probes show immediate “turn-on” fluorescence (<1
s) upon the addition of OCl–, display an increase
in the fluorescence quantum yield (3.7-fold in Probe-1 and 11.6-fold in Probe-OCl), and are completely soluble
in aqueous media without the help of any cosolvent. However, a decrease
in the “turn-on” intensity with the oxidized version
of Probe-1 in cell assays due to the anhydride/phthalate
functionality suggests that probe degradation occurs based on hydrolytic
action (a probe degradation half-life of ∼1500 s at 15 μM Probe-1 and 150 μM OCl). Thus, the change of “anhydride”
to “methylamide” begets Probe-OCl, which
possesses more stability without sacrificing its water solubility
properties and responses at short times. Further studies suggest that Probe-OCl is highly stable within physiological pH (pH = 7.4).
Surprisingly, in live cell experiments involving U-2 OS cells and
HeLa cells, Probe-OCl accumulated and aggregated in lipid
droplets and gives a “turn-on” fluorescence response.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays
confirmed that Probe-OCl is not toxic. Cuvette aggregation
studies were also performed (tetrahydrofuran/H2O) to demonstrate
aggregation-induced fluorescence at longer times. Our current hypothesis
is that the “turn-on” fluorescence effect is caused
by the aggregation-induced emission mechanism available for Probe-OCl. In this case, in tandem, we reanalyzed the Mes-BOD-SePh derivative to compare and contrast cell localization
as imaged by confocal microscopy; fluorescence emission occurs in
the absence of, or prior to, Se oxidation.

Introduction
In recent years, many
researchers have been focusing on the development
and optimization of optical and visualization methods to discern the
plethora of important small-molecule analytes such as metal cations,
anions, and biologically active neutral or zwitterionic molecules
[biothiols and reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)]
that are created and exist within the biological system.1 To achieve this aim, many precise analytical
methods have been developed, which involve methods and systems such
as potentiometric,2 coulometric, colorimetric
methods,3 and quantum dot media.4 Because there is no perfect sensor, the quest
to synthesize a soluble medium that is small molecule in nature and
also bears other excellent attributes including selectivity, sensitivity,
reusability, etc. is still being undertaken. These methods have several
drawbacks such as high detection limits [limit of detection (LOD)]
and require relatively long times for acquisition of results or extensive
procedures, as well as expensive instruments to obtain a quantitative
result. On the other hand, fluorescence methods have many advantages:
they are specific, sensitive toward specific analytes, easy to handle,
and have a high temporal and spatial resolution, thus accommodating
the possibilities for both in vitro and in vivo bioimaging.5−8 Currently, the majority of fluorophores which have been synthesized
address problems such as complex or difficult syntheses, large molecular
size, and poor solubility; hence, these factors limit the applications
of the fluorophore in fluorescence labeling and functionalization.
Among the reported organic dyes, maleimide derivatives offer various
promising properties, such as high emissivity, large Stokes shifts,
water solubility, and ease of modification with many functional groups.8b

Through continuous research efforts, more
research results have
emerged regarding ROS/RNS and its important role in maintaining the
physiological and biological processes of the human body.9−11 Among other ROS/RNS, hypochlorous acid (OCl–)
is a highly potent oxidant generated during phagocytosis that serves
as a pathogen “killer” within the immune system.12,13 OCl– is one of the most biologically important
ROS; OCl– is produced by the myeloperoxidase enzyme
in leukocytes (macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils), and the reaction
between chloride (Cl–) and H2O2 gives OCl–.14−19 The OCl– species, an oxidizing agent of great
renown, can undergo reaction with biothiol groups (cysteine, homocysteine,
and glutathione) and thioethers (such as methionine) within cells.20,21 Because of this action, an excess in concentration of OCl– in biological systems can lead to inflammation-associated tissue
damage and a series of life-threatening diseases, such as neurodegenerative
disease [i.e., Alzheimer’s disease (AD)],22 atherosclerotic,23−25 cardiovascular disease,26,27 hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury,28,29 lung injury,30 and cancer;31 therefore, the development of new biocompatible
classes of molecules that can help for use in highly sensitive and
selective ROS fluorescent probes in living systems is vitally important.

To date, a number of fluorescent small molecules have been synthesized
and characterized to detect HOCl.32−35 However, the real-time detection
of HOCl in a biological system remains a challenge.36−38 The presence
of a cosolvent,39 low sensitivity, poor
photostability and/or chemostability (possibly photobleaching or facile
S–E bond cleavage), and long response time, for example, in
some cases hinder the actual use in biological systems.40 Over a period of decades, extensive efforts
have been put forth to develop highly selective fluorescent probes
for the imaging of ROS at the cellular level. The precise measurement
of concentrations of ROS in living systems is a challenging proposition,
and chemosensing with excellent selectivity and high sensitivity is
the tool in need, which can be employed for the present goal. Many
strategies were used to detect HOCl based on its high reactivity;
compounds containing thiol,41,42 oxime,43−45 dibenzoylhydrazine,46p-methoxyphenol,47,48 and organochalcogen (S, Se, and
Te) units49−53 have been used. They have displayed highly responsive properties
upon oxidation that can be used as HOCl-reactive moieties.

Lipid
droplets (LDs) are organelles in cells whose size varies
between 20 and 100 nm; LDs conserve and maintain the production of
neutral lipids such as steryl esters, triglycerides, and retinyl esters
in the cells (eukaryotic and some prokaryotic).54−56 LDs can be
identified by their hydrophobic central core which is surrounded by
a single layer of amphiphilic lipids and proteins, which separate
between the aqueous and organic layers.57 LDs may be found accumulated in the cytoplasm of cells, especially
in cells which are responsible for the trafficking and protein maturation.58 LDs are well-known for their important role
in the human immune system such as to modulate the stability of proteins
and for exchanging the protein. In addition, LDs are known as a powerhouse
for synthesizing molecules important for defense against pathogens
such as eicosanoids. Besides that, LDs also help convert overabundant
fatty acids into triglycerides in order to separate healthy and toxic
fatty acids and keep them housed within relatively inert LDs.59 Recent studies suggest that lipid oxidation
products increase in the brains of AD patients and may involve a significant
increase in the concentration of LDs in many diseases characterized
by the abnormal concentration of lipid supply and metabolism.60,61 LD buildup in cells can occur during the progression of pathologies
such as neuropathies, cardiomyopathies, or during liver inflammation
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus.62 The development and progression of several common metabolic diseases
such as obesity, type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome have been associated with the abnormality in neutral lipid
storage.63a Despite their proposed strong
relationship to many diseases, our knowledge of LDs is still quite
limited.63b

In continuation of our
efforts directed toward the development
of molecular probes involving phenyl selenide groups as reactive substituents,
we recently reported a novel meso mesitylene-BODIPY system.
This system contains a chloro- and phenyl selenide at the 2- and 6-positions,
respectively, which can react specifically toward HOCl in vitro and
also supply a “turn-on” fluorescence in the presence
of LD living cells because of aggregation-induced emission (AIE).51 The effect of other substituents on the BODIPY
system during the detection of HOCl was also investigated.51,53,65

Even though many application
studies have been achieved using phthalate
molecules and anhydride derivatives,66 to
the best of our knowledge, anhydride and amide phenyl selenide conjugates
have never been investigated in such fluorescence studies; here, we
pursue selective, water-soluble, and low-molecular-weight detection
of HOCl in vitro and demonstrate a “turn-on” response.
Because of the susceptibility of phthalates to decomposition, Probe-OCl was investigated in detail despite its apparent
vulnerability.67−69 Further studies in living cells also demonstrated
that Probe-OCl has the ability to accumulate within LDs
and act with “turn-on” fluorescence signaling prior
to Se oxidation and gives rise to fluorescence because of the AIE
effects.

Results and Discussion
The syntheses of Probe-1(67) and Probe-OCl are outlined
in Scheme 1 for comparison.
The starting materials were
synthesized according to a known literature procedure. The diene product
underwent reaction with phenylselenyl chloride in the presence of
acetonitrile and water and then undergoes a Diels–Alder reaction
to form Probe-1 and Probe-OCl in good yield
(51 and 62%), respectively. The structures of Probe-1 and Probe-OCl were characterized by spectroscopic techniques
[multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral data, mass
spectrometry (MS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Figures
S4–S18, Supporting Information].

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Probe-1(67) and Probe-OCl for HOCl
Results from the study of UV–visible spectroscopy
of Probe-1 and Probe-OCl are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S19 and S24).
The spectroscopy analysis of Probe-1 and Probe-OCl (15 μM in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4) is explained in Table 1. Both probes show a “turn-off”
emission because of the incorporation of the phenylselenyl group at
the 2-position of the probe, which quenches the fluorescence by an
intramolecular photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) process and gives
a “turn-on” fluorescence after the addition of OCl– (Figure 1).

Both
probes inherit identical photophysical properties and selectivity
toward OCl–. However, Probe-1 is not
as stable as Probe-OCl (Figures S19–S23, Supporting Information). We observed that upon
the addition of OCl–, the emission of Probe-1 gradually decreased over time as observed in the time-dependent
experiment (Figure 2A). This could likely occur because of the instability of the anhydride
functional group in the aqueous or cellular environment. We suspected
that the anhydride motif within Probe-1 undergoes hydrolysis/degradation;
thus, decreasing the emission of the resulting molecule proposed to
be due to C–O bond rupture and anhydride ring opening and resulting
in no loss of the ability for Se to become singly oxidized/oxygenated. Probe-1 and perhaps its depleted form are less likely to aggregate,
and our thinking is that the C–O cleavage tendency is only
likely to make the tendency for aggregation decrease. On the other
hand, the incorporation of methylamide within the skeleton of Probe-OCl affords a much greater stability to Probe-OCl as suggested in the time-dependent experiment (Figure 2B). The stability of Probe-OCl opens the possibility for Probe-OCl to be applied suitably in live cell imaging.

Figure 2 Comparison of time-dependent
emission spectra of [A] Probe-1 (15 μM) and [B] Probe-OCl (15 μM) with
various concentrations of NaOCl in solution (10 mM PBS pH 7.4) incubated

nm (Probe-1); λex: 416 nm, λem: 523 nm (Probe-OCl). Slit width 3.0 nm/3.0
nm.

First, we investigated the photophysical
properties of Probe-OCl. UV–visible absorption
spectra show the maximum absorption
at 396 nm. However, upon the addition of OCl– (1.0
equiv) to Probe-OCl, the absorbance peak undergoes a
red shift (toward longer wavelength) to 416 nm, whereas after the
addition of other ROS/RNS, no significant change in the absorption
spectra of Probe-OCl could be observed (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The selectivity of Probe-OCl toward various ROS/RNS (NaOCl, H2O2, tBuOOH, O2•–, •OH, tBuO•, NO, and ONOO–) was conducted under physiological
conditions of the human body in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4. At a concentration
of 15.0 μM, Probe-OCl showed selectivity toward
OCl– (Figure 3A); there is no increase in the fluorescence intensity toward
other ROS/RNS even when higher concentrations of other ROS/RNS (20
equiv) were made available. The addition of NaOCl to Probe-OCl gives a rise in emission centered at 523 nm with the enhancement
of fluorescence intensity gauged at ∼30 fold. The fluorescence
quantum yield (ΦF) of Probe-OCl was
found to be 0.032, related to the assigned PET process involving the
incorporation of the phenylselenyl group. However, the addition of
the NaOCl analyte allowed for a significant increase in the quantum
yield (up to 0.37) because of the formation of Probe-OCl[O] (Scheme 2).

λem: 523 nm. Slit width 3 nm/3 nm.

Scheme 2 Reversible Oxidation Mechanism for the Detection of
NaOCl
Next, the interference study
of OCl– with other
ROS/RNS was employed. This suggested that the excess of different
oxidants does not serve in an additive fashion. The results clearly
showed that the other ROS/RNS did not give any observable optical
changes in the emission spectrum (Figure S27, Supporting Information). Since the presence of even a small aliquot
of metal ion solution at high dilution with Probe-OCl may serve as interference for the sensor and therefore for the reaction
and the desired operation of the probe with OCl–. We first added various soluble metal ions in the solution of Probe-OCl (15.0 μM), followed by OCl– (5.0 equiv). This result shows that the metal ions did not interfere
with Probe-OCl (Figure S28, Supporting Information).

In order to monitor OCl– in macrophage cells, Probe-OCl should
remain stable in a slightly
acidic environment without eliciting any fluorescence response. Hence,
we tested the response of Probe-OCl toward OCl– at various pH levels (Figure 4). The results reveal that, as expected, the pH value of the
solution has an influence on the fluorescence response to [OCl–]. As shown in Figure 3, the fluorescence intensity at 523 nm of the Probe-OCl response to OCl– was gradually
enhanced when the pH increased in the range of 6.0–7.0; it
reached the maximum intensity in the range of 7.4–11.0. However,
in the pH range of 4.0–5.0, the probe did not respond to OCl–; we did not observe any fluorescence enhancement in
this pH region (4–5) because of the pH effect toward Probe-OCl detection. The trend of fluorescence intensity changes
of Probe-OCl at 523 nm demonstrates that the probe can
tolerate a slightly acidic environment; because of this, it is suitable
to detect OCl– in living media and cellular subcompartments
such as macrophage cells.

Figure 4 Changes of the emission spectra of Probe-OCl (15 μM)
with NaOCl (10 equiv) under various pH conditions in solution (10
mM PBS, pH 7.4) incubated for 1.0 min λex: 416 nm,
λem: 523 nm. Slit width 3.0 nm/3.0 nm.

Titration of Probe-OCl with the increase
of the concentrations
of NaOCl (0–150 μM) was carried out; the experiments
supported that the emission intensity of Probe-OCl proportionally
increases upon the addition of NaOCl from 0 to 10 equiv (Figure 3B). The fluorescence
of Probe-OCl reached emission saturation after the addition
of 9 equiv of NaOCl. Further study showed that the LOD of the probe
was determined to be 90 nM (Figure S27, Supporting Information).

The time-dependent study of Probe-OCl and Probe-1 was carried out simultaneously with the
addition of 10 equiv of
NaOCl. Probe-OCl shows a very fast response upon the
addition of NaOCl and gives a strong green fluorescence just after
the addition of NaOCl (Figure 5). On the other hand, we observed a rapid decrease in the
emission intensity with Probe-1. The time-dependent experiments
of Probe-OCl indicate that Probe-OCl reacts
very fast with OCl–; this result opens up the possibility
of Probe-OCl to be used as a real-time sensing agent
in the cellular level.

Figure 5 Comparative time-dependent emission spectra of Probe-OCl (15 μM) and Probe-1 (15 μM) with the addition
of 10.0 equiv of NaOCl in the 10 mM PBS pH 7.4, followed by incubation
for 3000 s; λex: 404 nm, λem: 502
nm (Probe-1) λex: 416 nm, λem: 523 nm (Probe-OCl). Slit width 3.0 nm/3.0
nm.

It has been known that OCl– has an ability to
oxidize selenium to selenoxide in aqueous, as well as in organic solvent,
media. We hypothesized that OCl– will clearly oxidize
selenium to selenoxide under sufficient concentrations of analyte.
In order to help confirm the reaction mechanism, the characterization
of the oxidized species was carried out by high-resolution MS (HRMS)
data of Probe-OCl with OCl– (5.0 equiv).
The m/z peak at 385.9843 (found)
is consistent with the selenoxide version of Probe-OCl [385.9907 (calcd) [M + Na+] (Figure S16, Supporting Information).
In addition, we observed the shift in the 77Se NMR spectrum
from 399.4 to 985.3 ppm, which is related to the oxidation of selenide
(Figure S12, Supporting Information). Accordingly,
the formation of the selenoxide blocks electron transfer from the
phenyl selenide donor moiety to Probe-OCl, which results
in a blocking of the PET process and an increase in the emission intensity
of the probe. These HRMS data support that selenoxide formation has
occurred after the addition of OCl– to the Probe-OCl solution (Scheme 2).

To investigate the reversibility of the chemical
oxidation, Probe-OCl[O] was treated with biothiols such
as glutathione,
homocysteine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and l-cysteine, which has an ability to revert the selenium oxide
species (R2Se=O) to its original reduced state (R2Se).71,72 The result (Figure 6) showed a significant decrease
in the fluorescence intensity with glutathione, l-cysteine,
and homocysteine. In the case of glutathione and homocysteine addition,
oxidized Probe-OCl gives a “turn-off” fluorescence
signal after 5 h of incubation time involving a screening that simulates
the sequence of several redox cycles (Figure S33, Supporting Information). Surprisingly, the addition of l-cysteine into oxidized Probe-OCl gives a “turn-off”
fluorescence within 5 min and the redox cycles can be repeated four
times.53 This result indicates that Probe-OCl has reversibility attributes desirable for next-generation
probing.

with the addition of 10 equiv of l-cysteine after 5 min in
solution (10 mM PBS pH 7.4). λex: 416 nm, λem: 523 nm. Width 3.0 nm/3.0 nm.

To confirm the nature of the photomechanism at play, density
functional
theory (DFT) geometry optimization calculations were performed. Optimized
structures were estimated by DFT calculations using the Gaussian 09
program. The B3LYP functional with a 6-31g* basis set was used, and
the 6-311g* basis set was used only for Se; all calculations were
performed in the gas phase (Figure S28, Supporting Information). As observed by considering the geometry of the
optimized structure of Probe-OCl and Probe-OCl[O], the case of these two kinds of molecular orbital electron density
maps is surprising; they seem almost the same and are without the
involvement of the selenyl position. Also, the difference in energy
between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of DFT-optimized geometries of probe and
oxidized probe is almost the same. Differences of electronic distributions
were observed in the case of HOMO – 2, HOMO, and LUMO + 1 orbitals.
In parts of electronic distributions for HOMO – 2, LUMO + 1,
the phenylselenium moiety does not possess electronic distribution
density, and in the HOMO segment, all of the electronic distributions
involved the phenylselenium moiety. Therefore, HOMO-to-LUMO electronic
distributions changed from being directly on the phenylselenium moiety
to being on the center of the naphthalimide moiety. On the other hand,
the electron transfer from phenylselenium to the naphthalimide core
of the chemically oxidized probe could have occurred more effectively
than for the probe because the electronic distributions seen in the
HOMO – 2, HOMO, LUMO + 2 level overlapped with phenylselenium
from the naphthalimide core (Figure S29, Supporting Information). From these results, the fluorescence “turn-on”
event could be explained by a blockage of the PET that would ordinarily
exist between phenylselenium and the naphthalimide core occurring
from the oxidation of the selenium center (Table S3, Supporting Information).

To further demonstrate the
applicability of Probe-OCl, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT)
assays were performed. Probe-OCl was found to be nontoxic
to cells and did not interfere with cell proliferation (Figures S31
and S32, Supporting Information). To examine
prospective biological applications of Probe-OCl, U-2
OS (Figure 7) and HeLa
cells (Figure S32, Supporting Information) were chosen for live cell imaging. DRAQ5 was used to costain the
nucleus of the cells; 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and Alexa-488
were used because of the similar range of excitation wavelength with Probe-OCl and Mes-BOD-SePh. Then, U-2 OS cells
were treated with Probe-OCl, followed by a 10 min incubation
period, and the cells were expected to exhibit low fluorescence based
on the presence of the synthetic molecule. Surprisingly, a strong
fluorescent dot pattern was observed (Figure 7A). Then, we compared the Se results with
those from our previous work using BODIPY mesitylene functionalized
at the so-called meso-position (MES-BOD-SePh).51 We conclude that the fluorescence observed could
be caused by the aggregation of the probe within
a LD, as the images showed a similar pattern and overlapped with the
previous developed MES-BOD-SePh, which selectively targets
the LDs (Figure 7B).
Furthermore, to confirm that our Probe-OCl selectively
targets LDs, both probes were counterincubated and observed to overlap
in their signals and fluorescence characteristics (Figure 7C).

with 25 μM Probe-OCl (blue, Ex/Em 405/500) in PBS
[B] and 25 μM Mes-BOD-SePh (green, Ex/Em 488/530)
[C] and coincubated for 10 min. Probe-OCl signals were
consistent with LD staining dye MES-BOD-SePh. Scale bar,
10 μm.

The AIE feature of Probe-OCl was investigated in a
tetrahydrofuran (THF)/water mixture, by measuring the increase of
the fluorescence emission spectrum of Probe-OCl (Figure 7). Probe-OCl exhibited weak emission in THF; there is no increase in the emission
intensity up to a 9:1 (v/v) THF/water mixture. Surprisingly, we observed
a significant increase in the emission intensity in a THF/water mixture
when a ratio of 4:6 is used (Figure 8). The fluorescence intensity decreased dramatically
and reached the lowest intensity measured when the water fraction
reached ∼80%. However, when the water fraction reached ∼90%,
the fluorescence intensity increased. These optical changes are attributed
to twisted intramolecular charge-transfer effects arising from increased
solvent polarity as seen through a solvent system that is gradually
increasing in its portion of water.68 The
addition of water can effectively influence the present conditions
of Probe-OCl; therefore, Probe-OCl possesses
AIE properties.

Conclusions
In summary, two fluorescent
probes, Probe-1 and Probe-OCl, were scrutinized
and compared in new cellular media
and directly prepared and characterized based on a synthetic intermediate
of mycophenolic acid for the specific detection of hypochlorous acid
(HOCl). Both probes showed sensitive, selective, and fast responses
to HOCl over other ROS/RNS because of the oxidation of selenide to
selenoxide. Both probes showed immediate “turn-on” fluorescence
responses (<1 s) upon the addition of OCl– and showed an increase in their
quantum yield (3.8-fold in Probe-1 and 11-fold in Probe-OCl); they are completely soluble in aqueous media without
the help of any cosolvent. Further studies showed that Probe-1 is unstable in a water environment at longer times and undergoes
what could be categorized as fluorescence photobleaching. Therefore,
we incorporated methylmaleimide within Probe-OCl to help
increase the stability of the compounds. The superiority of Probe-OCl includes high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid
“turn-on” fluorescence response for HOCl under physiological
pH. Surprisingly, when Probe-OCl was studied in living
cells (U-2 OS cells and HeLa cells), MTT assays confirmed that Probe-OCl is not toxic. Probe-OCl undergoes AIE
in LDs. We reanalyzed the Mes-BOD-SePh derivative for
a comparative localization of probes. Probe-OCl was reported
to be a probe for LDs as seen in cuvette aggregation and induced fluorescence
based on the addition of OCl– but lacks stability-based
hydrolytic action of water (probe degradation with a half-life of
∼1500 s at 15 μM Probe-1 and 150 μM
OCl). Thus, the change of “anhydride” to “methylamide”—an
interesting substitution to explore in medicinal chemistry—led
us to investigate Probe-OCl. This system is more appropriate,
and this phenomenon helped make determinations within the range of
physiological pH and based on associated attributes such as stability
than compared with Probe-1.

General
Considerations
All chemicals were used without
further purification and purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich,
Tokyo Chemical Industry). 1H, 13C, 77Se NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker Avance 400 and Agilent-NMR-vnmrs
600 MHz spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) and dimethyl selenide
were used as external standards. ESI-MS was performed on a Bruker
micrOTOF-QII by the research support staff at KAIST. A time-of-flight
mass spectrometer was operated at a resolution of 20 000. Absorption
spectra and stopped-flow absorption spectra were measured using a
JASCO V-530 and JASCO-815 UV–vis spectrophotometer, respectively.
Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu RF-5301pc
spectrofluorophotometer.

penta-2,3-dienoate (0.400 g, 3.17 mmol) in MeCN (6 mL) was subsequently
added to 1 mL of H2O, which was then added to a well-stirred
solution of PhSeCl (0.912 g, 4.75 mmol) in 5 mL of MeCN at room temperature.
Then, the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2
h. The mixture was then evaporated directly and purified by column

Synthesis
of Probe-1 (7-Hydroxy-4-methyl-5-(phenylselanyl)isobenzofuran-1,3-dione)
A solution of triethylamine (0.438 mL, 3.14 mmol) in acetonitrile
(5 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of 5-methyl-4-(phenylselanyl)furan-2(5H)-one (0.400 g, 1.57 mmol) and trimethylacetyl chloride
(0.387 mL, 3.14 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL), and the mixture was
stirred at 60 °C for 14 h. The precipitate of triethylamine hydrochloride
was formed, precipitated, and filtered away. The filtrate was then
washed with 10% sodium carbonate, dried over MgSO4, and
concentrated. The residue was concentrated and filtered through silica
gel using petroleum ether/EtOAc (4:1) to afford the diene as a colorless
oil. This was used directly for the next reaction. The above-mentioned
diene (0.390 g, 1.15 mmol) and maleic anhydride (0.136 g, 1.38 mmol)
were dissolved in diethyl ether (3 mL) under N2 and stirred
overnight. Concentrated H2SO4 (1.5 mL) at 263
K was added slowly to this resulting sticky liquid product. The cream-colored
mixture was stirred for 5 min and then poured over crushed ice. The
precipitated product was filtered off, washed by the addition of ice
water, dried, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica
gel flash column chromatography using n-hexane/EtOAc

A solution of triethylamine (0.472 mL, 3.40 mmol) in acetonitrile
(5 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of 5-methyl-4-(phenylselanyl)furan-2(5H)-one (0.500 mg, 2.80 mmol) and trimethylacetyl chloride
(0.417 mL, 3.40 mmol) in acetonitrile (15 mL), and the mixture was
stirred at 60 °C for 14 h. The precipitate of triethylamine hydrochloride
was formed and filtered off. The filtrate was washed with 10% sodium
carbonate, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The residue
was concentrated and filtered through silica gel using a petroleum
ether/EtOAc (4:1) solvent combination to afford the diene as a colorless
oil. This was used directly for the next reaction. The above-mentioned
diene (0.600 g, 1.53 mmol) and N-methylmaleimide
(0.150 g, 1.53 mmol) were dissolved in diethyl ether (3.0 mL) under
N2 and stirred overnight. Concentrated H2SO4 (1.5 mL) at 263 K was added slowly to the resulting sticky
liquid product. The cream-colored mixture was stirred for 5 min and
then poured over crushed ice. The precipitated product was filtered
off, washed by the addition of ice water, dried, and concentrated.

Preparation of Samples
Stock solutions
(10 mM) of Probe-1 and Probe-OCl were prepared
in dimethyl
sulfoxide. The test solution was prepared by the addition of 15 μM Probe-1 and Probe-OCl to 3 mL of PBS (10 mM,
pH 7.4). After that, analytes were added, and a vortex mixer was used
to make solutions homogeneous and ready for measurements.

Measurement
of Quantum Yield
The fluorescence quantum
yield of Probe-1 and Probe-OCl before and
after the reaction with OCl– was measured with fluorescein
as a reference (0.10 M NaOH). The quantum yield was calculated with
a comparative method according to the equation  where QR is the
fluorescence quantum yield of fluorescein, m is the
slope of the line obtained from the plot of the integrated fluorescence
intensity versus absorbance, and n is the refractive
index of the solvent. Subscript R refers to the reference measurement
(fluorescein).

Determination of LOD
LOD of probes
was calculated from
fluorescence titration measurements and blank measurements. To obtain
the value for the slope, the values of fluorescence titration measurement
intensity for Probe-1 (502 nm) and Probe-OCl (523 nm) were used, respectively. Therefore, the detection limit
was calculated with the following equation:  where σ is the standard deviation of
10 blank measurements and k is the absolute value
of the slope between the fluorescence intensity versus the HOCl concentration.

DFT Calculations
The molecular structures of Probe-OCl and Probe-OCl[O] and their HOMO–LUMO
levels were calculated by DFT calculations by Gaussian 09 software
(B3LYP method with 6-311g* basis set for Se only and 6-31g*).

Cell Maintenance
and Live Cell Imaging
HeLa and U-2
OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco) or RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL, Gibco).
The HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 0.6 × 105 cells on sterilized μ-slides (ibidi, München, Germany).
After 24 h, cells were washed with Dulbecco’s PBS (D-PBS) two
times. Next, 25 μM Probe-OCl and 25 μM MES-BOD-SePh were added to the cells, and the cells were incubated
for 10 min at 37 °C and washed with D-PBS two times. Live cell
images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany)
laser scanning confocal microscope, and 63× objective lens were
used. The excitation wavelengths were 405 and 488 nm, and the detection
wavelengths were 410–495 and 500–563 nm.

Cell Viability
Assays
The proliferation of HeLa cells
was determined by the MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich) using an established
procedure. Briefly, the HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×
104 cells into a 96-well plate (n = 4).
Next, the cells were pretreated with Probe-OCl at various
concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μM) for 1–6 h.
After incubation, the proliferation reagent MTT (0.5 μg/mL)
was added to each well, and the reagent-applied cells were incubated
for 3 h at 37 °C and under 5% CO2. Absorbances were
measured using a Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific) at 540 nm, and
the reference wavelength was 690 nm.
