In
the present work, the oxidation stability of blends of methyl
oleate, zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), and a high viscosity index
mineral base oil was determined by the method of a rotating pressure
vessel, while the antiwear abilities were evaluated on a four-ball
friction tester. Thereafter, the thermal decomposition characteristics
and oxidation products of the oxidized blends were analyzed by a thermogravimetric
analyzer and a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer, respectively.
The results showed that the antioxidation ability of ZDDP was substantially
improved by methyl oleate, while the antiwear capacity is markedly
impaired by methyl oleate. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition
characteristics and oxidation products of ZDDP-containing oils were
altered by methyl oleate. The present study evidently convinced that
chemical interactions between ZDDP and methyl oleate had occurred,
which were attributed to the increased antioxidation ability and decreased
antiwear capacity of ZDDP in oils contaminated with methyl oleate.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Engine oils are very important
lubricants. They are blends of mineral
or synthetic base oils and varieties of additives such as detergents,
dispersants, and oxidation inhibitors. Zinc dialkyldithiophosphates
(ZDDPs) are excellent multifunctional additives and have been extensively
used in engine oils as antiwear agents, antioxidants, and corrosion
inhibitors for over 60 years. Although in recent years, the total
elimination of ZDDPs or only extremely low levels of ZDDPs in engine
oils has been expected, due to increased automotive emissions caused
by phosphorous- and sulfur-poisoned catalytic converters, no acceptable
antiwear additives to replace ZDDPs are currently available, and the
research concerning ZDDPs remains one of the most interested topics
in the tribological field.1−4

Biodiesel is a competent, environmentally friendly
substitute for
conventional petrodiesel. It comes from renewable vegetable oils or
animal fats and consists mainly of unsaturated and saturated fatty
acid methyl esters (FAME) such as methyl oleate, methyl linoleate,
methyl linolenate, and methyl stearate. In the past few decades, a
vast amount of studies on the production and performances of biodiesel
has been performed and reported.5−8

As we know, during the operation of an engine,
a small amount of
incompletely combusted fuel will scrap into the engine oil sump by
oil seepage flow or gas entrainment. Therefore, engine oils are regularly
exposed to fuel dilution, which adversely affects their quality and
thus performances. It has been known that due to its relatively higher
viscosity and reactivity, biodiesel is more prone to accumulate in
engine crankcase and is more harmful to engine oil quality than conventional
petrodiesels.9,10 The effects of biodiesel on engine
oil degradation have as such become special concerns during operation
of a biodiesel-driven engine. In previous years, although some investigations
have been done to understand the negative impacts of biodiesel on
engine oil deterioration,11−16 the nature of engine oil degradation caused by biodiesel is still
not fully clear.

Conventionally, engine oil degradation under
engine operation conditions
is accompanied by very complicated chemical reactions such as oxidation
and polymerization. Thus, from chemical points of view, engine oil
degradation induced by biodiesel can naturally be ascribed to the
chemical characteristics of FAMEs and their interactions with engine
oil components, viz. additives and base oils. The present investigation
focused on the performance characteristics of ZDDP in a mineral base
oil under the influence of methyl oleate, which is an abundant FAME
in most biodiesels. Antioxidation ability and antiwear capacity of
ZDDP in oils blended with methyl oleate were evaluated, and thereafter
the thermal decomposition characteristics and the chemical compositions
of the oxidized oils containing ZDDP and methyl oleate were analyzed,
in an attempt to understand the effectiveness of ZDDP in biodiesel-fueled
engine oils.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
In this work, methyl oleate
(purity ≥99%) was obtained from Xiya Chemicals Co. Ltd. China.
The ZDDP used was zinc dioctyl dithiophosphate purchased from Tianhe
Petrochemicals Co. Ltd. China, while n-hexadecane
(purity ≥99.5%) was provided by Kemiou Chemical agents Co.
Ltd. China. Additionally, a mineral base oil of HVI 350 (kinematic
viscosity = 68.57 mm2 s–1, 40 °C;
viscosity index = 98; flash point = 221 °C; pour point = −6
°C) was provided by Sinopec, China. Prior to experimentations,
a series of blends of different mass percentages of methyl oleate
(abbreviated as MO), ZDDP, HVI 350 (abbreviated as HVI), or n-hexadecane (abbreviated as C16) were prepared,
which were herein named MO/ZDDP/HVI or MO/ZDDP/C16 blends,
respectively. Namely, MO/ZDDP/HVI refers to the blends of different
contents of MO, ZDDP, and HVI, while MO/ZDDP/C16 refers
to the blends of MO, ZDDP, and C16. Taking MO (20%)/ZDDP
(2%)/HVI (78%) for example, it indicates that it is a blend of 20%
MO, 2% ZDDP, and 78% HVI.

2.2 Oxidation Stability Test
The oxidation
stabilities of 12 MO/ZDDP/HVI blends with various contents of MO and
ZDDP were evaluated by the rotating pressure vessel method following
the Chinese standard SH/T0193, which well corresponds to ASTM D2272
in the determination of oxidation stability of lubricating oils. The
oxidation induction periods of MO/ZDDP/HVI blends were determined.
Longer induction period indicates better oxidation stability of a
sample.

2.3 Wear Test
In this work, antiwear
performances of a series of fresh and oxidized MO/ZDDP/HVI blends
with a constant content of ZDDP of 2% but various contents of MO were
evaluated on a MMW-1P universal four-ball friction tester. The four-ball
friction tester consists of a rotating ball that slides on three stationary
balls located in an oil cup under selected loads. The balls used in
the wear test were GCr15 bearing steel balls (diameter 12.7 mm, hardness
59–61 HRC, and surface roughness Ra 0.040 μm). The wear tests were performed under the loads of
392 N at the rotary speed of 1200 rpm for 30 min. The wear scar diameters
(WSDs) of the worn surfaces of the steel balls, which well characterize
the antiwear behavior of a lubricant, were determined after each test
run. Lower WSD demonstrates better antiwear performance of a lubricant.
The oxidation experimentations of MO/ZDDP/HVI blends were performed
in a glass reactor at a constant temperature of 150 °C under
an air atmosphere (flow rate of 300 mL min–1) for
6 h.

2.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
To understand the interactions between ZDDP and MO, and thus the
effects of MO on the performances of ZDDP, thermal decomposition characteristics
of two oxidized blends of MO/ZDDP/HVI, viz. MO (0%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI
(98%) and MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (78%), were evaluated using a SDT-Q600
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) from TA Instruments. Typically, about
10 mg of samples, in an alumina pan, were heated at a rate of 10 °C/min
from room temperature to 600 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (flow
rate of 50 mL/min.). The oxidation of the MO/ZDDP/HVI blends was performed
following the procedures of oxidation experimentations as described
in 2.3.

2.5 Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS)
Analysis
Since mineral base oils are very complex blends
of hydrocarbons of different sizes and structures, characterization
of chemical compositions of oxidation products of MO/ZDDP/HVI can
be highly difficult. Thus, to simplify GC/MS analysis, n-hexadecane instead of HVI was used as a surrogate for mineral base
oil. In this work, two MO/ZDDP/C16 blends, viz. MO (0%)/ZDDP
(2%)/C16 (98%) and MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/C16 (78%),
were used. Prior to analysis, the MO/ZDDP/C16 blends were
subjected to thermal oxidation following the procedures of oxidation
experimentations as described in Section 2.3. After oxidation, the chemical compositions
of the oxidized samples were characterized on a gas chromatograph
coupled to a mass spectrometer. The GC/MS analysis was performed following
the procedures as reported previously by the authors.17 In short, chromatographic separation was conducted on a
quartz capillary column with helium as the carrier gas. The GC oven
programmed temperature was set at an initial temperature of 160 °C
for 3 min and ramped at a rate of 10 °C min–1 to 240 °C for 2 min and then at 5 °C min–1 to 300 °C where it was held for 10 min. Mass spectrometry analyses
were carried out in the EI mode.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Effect of MO on the Antioxidation
Ability
of ZDDP
Oxidation stability is one of the most important
characteristics of engine oils. Shown in Figure 1 are the oxidation induction periods for
various MO/ZDDP/HVI blends.

Figure 1 Oxidation induction periods for MO/ZDDP/HVI
blends.

In Figure 1, a significant
increase in induction periods for oils with ZDDP is observable. However,
a drastic decrease in induction periods for oils with increasing concentrations
of MO is also obvious. These confirmed that ZDDP is a powerful oxidation
inhibitor but adversely MO is an intense oxidation enhancer for mineral
oils. The excellent antioxidation ability of ZDDP has been well known.
The readily oxidizing ability of unsaturated FAMEs due to their inherent
high chemical reactivity has also been widely accepted.18 Furthermore, by comparing the results of blends
with different contents of MO, it can also be found that in the case
of 0% MO, the induction periods of blends with ZDDP are approximately
two times higher than that without ZDDP. However, in the case of 5%
MO, 10% MO, or 20% MO, the induction periods of blends with ZDDP are
even three times higher than that without ZDDP. This indicated that
although the addition of MO markedly impaired the oxidation resistance
of oils, the ability of ZDDP in resisting the oxidation of oils was
substantially improved by MO. The enhanced antioxidative ability of
ZDDP can naturally be attributed to the interactions between ZDDP
and MO, on the mechanism of which intensive investigation is still
required. In addition, the positive effect of MO on the antioxidative
ability of ZDDP demonstrated that ZDDP had worked properly and efficiently
as an oxidation inhibitor in oils with MO.

3.2 Effect
of MO on the Antiwear Ability of ZDDP
Figure 2 shows the
wear scar diameters of the worn surfaces lubricated with fresh and
oxidized MO/ZDDP/HVI blends containing 2% of ZDDP but different percentages
of MO. To help in understanding the antiwear characteristics of ZDDP
and MO in a blend, WSDs for fresh and oxidized neat HVI 350 mineral
oil were also tested and are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 WSDs for fresh and oxidized MO/ZDDP/HVI blends
with different concentrations
of MO.

It is clear from Figure 2 that the variations of WSDs
for fresh and oxidized MO/ZDDP/HVI
blends with contents of MO are markedly different. This indicated
that MO had participated in the tribological processes but that its
effects on the antiwear ability of ZDDP were different before and
after oxidation of a blend. Before oxidation, a low concentration
of MO, namely, 5.0%, helped in improving the antiwear ability of ZDDP,
which might primarily be attributed to the fortified boundary lubrication
film strength thanks to the co-adsorption of polar MO molecules on
the friction surfaces. Adversely, at higher MO concentrations such
as 10 and 20%, the antiwear ability of ZDDP decreased with increasing
percentages of MO, as might probably be related on one hand to the
competitive adsorption between ZDDP and MO on the friction surfaces
and thus reduced boundary film strength, and on the other hand to
the decreased oil viscosity resulting from high percentages of MO
in a blend. However, after oxidation of MO/ZDDP/HVI blends, the antiwear
ability of ZDDP, although slightly improved in the blend without MO
in comparison to that before oxidation, was impaired obviously by
various and increasing contents of MO characterized by a substantial
increase in WSDs. From the chemical and tribological points of view,
the observable rise of WSDs for oxidized MO-containing blends was
undoubtedly correlated with the interactions, including tribo interactions,
between MO and ZDDP to form very complicated chemicals, which contributed
to the deteriorated antiwear performance of ZDDP.

3.3 Thermal Decomposition Characteristics
Figure 3 shows the
TGA curves, the percentage of mass loss versus temperature, for two
oxidized blends of MO (0%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (98%) and MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI
(78%).

Figure 3 TGA curves for oxidized blends of MO/ZDDP/HVI.

It can be observed from Figure 3 that the thermal decomposition characteristics of
the oxidized blends are markedly different. Typically, the blend of
MO (0%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (98%) thermally decomposed and volatilized by
two steps, first at the temperature of 267 °C and second at about
378 °C. A rapid and significant matter loss of 77.8% was detected
in the first step, which can be attributed to the evaporation of light
oxidation products and low molecular hydrocarbons of HVI 350 mineral
oil. However, the TGA curve of the MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (78%) blend
shifted to a lower temperature range, in comparison to that of MO
(0%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (98%). This indicated that thermal decomposition
characteristics of ZDDP-containing oils had been changed by MO. The
TGA profile for the MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (78%) blend can be divided
into three decomposition phases or three decomposition steps. In the
first phase that extends up to 326 °C, light oxidation products
or hydrocarbons decomposed initially at about 223 °C and then
volatilized evidently upon increasing temperatures, with a substantial
percentage of matter loss of 48.6%. In the second phase, from 326
to 361 °C, heavier oxidation products decomposed and rapidly
evaporated, producing a sharp loss of mass of 39.2%. In the third
phase, after 380 °C, a small amount of mass loss is observable,
which corresponded to the cracking of high molecular oxidation products,
leaving behind traces of nonvolatile residues, possibly arising from
the metallic zinc of ZDDP. The TGA results demonstrated that different
varieties and amounts of chemicals had been produced during oxidation
of the blends of MO (0%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI (98%) and MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/HVI
(78%). It is thus reasonable to speculate that very complex chemical
interactions between ZDDP and MO, direct or indirect, are likely to
have occurred during oxidation of the blends.

Displayed in Figure 4 are total ion chromatograms (TICs) of GC/MS
analysis for two MO/ZDDP/C16 blends that had been thermally

products are also given in Tables 1 and 2.

By comparing the GC/MS
results of oxidized MO/ZDDP/C16 blends shown in Figure 4 and Tables 1, 2 with
those of oxidized MO/C16 blend, which have been previously
analyzed and reported by the authors,17 it can be observed clearly that a relatively
few varieties of oxygenated degradation products had been generated
for blends containing ZDDP. In fact, in our previous GC/MS analysis
of the oxidized MO/C16 blend, many varieties of oxy-compounds
of alcohols, ketones, acids, and esters were detected, typically characterized
by formation of 4-hexadecanedione (retention time 14.959 min; relative
content 12.906%), 1,2-dodecanediol (retention time 15.132 min; relative
content 11.023%), methyl palmitate (retention time 16.461 min; relative
content 10.962%), 1-pentyl decanol (retention time 15.239 min; relative
content 6.560%), and methyl stearate (retention time 18.321 min; relative
content 4.363%). Thus, the GC/MS results, in combination with the
oxidation stability results as shown in Figure 1, definitely convinced on one hand that MO
is inclined to induce the oxidation of oils and on the other hand
that ZDDP is excellent in inhibiting the oxidation of mineral oils.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy from Figure 4 that for the oxidized MO (0%)/ZDDP (2%)/C16 (98%) blend, a sulfur-containing compound of dioctyl disulfide
(17.893 min in Figure 4a) was detected, which is an excellent wear reducer and was thereby
an important attribute for improved antiwear ability as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, for the
oxidized MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/C16 (78%) blend, chemical species
containing sulfur and phosphorus such as dioctyl sulfoxide (15.405
min in Figure 4b) and
di(2-ethylhexyl) methyl phosphate (20.105 min in Figure 4b) were produced, which are
also good antiwear agents and had partially compensated the loss of
antiwear capacity caused by oxidation, although the antiwear abilities
of the oxidized MO-containing blends were slightly poorer than those
of fresh ones as also shown in Figure 3. Formation of sulfur and phosphorus-containing chemicals
indicated that ZDDP had taken part in the oxidation reactions and
had been partially depleted in the oxidation process. Finally, based
on the results of GC/MS analysis, as well as the results of oxidation
stability evaluation, TGA analysis, and wear tests, it can be firmly
concluded that chemical interactions of MO with ZDDP had occurred
during oxidation of MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/C16 (78%) blends,
obviously characterized by formation of dioctyl disulfide in the oxidized
MO (0%)/ZDDP (2%)/C16 (98%) blend, which might come from
thermal decomposition of ZDDP, but dioctyl sulfoxide and di(2-ethylhexyl)
methyl phosphate in the oxidized MO (20%)/ZDDP (2%)/C16 (78%) blend, which were definitely derived from reactions of ZDDP
with MO. Thus, from the results of the present study, it is reasonable
to infer that the mechanism of interactions between MO and ZDDP under
elevated temperatures is closely related to the inherent nature of
high chemical activity of MO to induce its intensive reactions with
ZDDP as well as with thermal decomposition products of ZDDP. Noticeable
chemical interactions between biodiesel and ZDDP have been previously
reported by Fang et al.,19 who observed
that degradation products of biodiesel could interact with oil additives
including ZDDP, with an associated result of reduced oil performances.
They also revealed that biodiesel dilution in lubricating oil could
result in production of complexes between oxidized biodiesel components
and ZDDP.

4 Conclusions
The
current study has demonstrated that MO substantially improved
the antioxidation ability but markedly impaired the antiwear capacity
of ZDDP. Furthermore, the present investigation also indicated that
thermal decomposition and oxidation characteristics of ZDDP-containing
oils were altered by MO. Thus, based on the present results, it can
be concluded that the effectiveness of ZDDP as an oxidation inhibitor
was fortified but as a wear reducer was hampered by MO in mineral
oils and that chemical interactions between ZDDP and MO were noticeable,
which were attributed to the increased antioxidation ability and decreased
antiwear capacity of ZDDP. Naturally, it can also be inferred from
the present results that the compatibility of ZDDP with other FAMEs
such as methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate is also likely to occur
and needs specific attention, to fight against quality degradation
of engine oil caused by biodiesel and to develop novel biodiesel engine
oil formulations.
