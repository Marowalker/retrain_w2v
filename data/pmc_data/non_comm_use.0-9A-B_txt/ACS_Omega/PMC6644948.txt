The
excellent physical and chemical properties of cyclodextrin
polymer (poly-CD)/azobenzene-modified polyacrylic acid (PAA-Azo) binary
composite hydrogels have been designed and prepared. The prepared
hydrogels were subjected to a variety of characterizations, including
scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, circular dichroism
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, rheological properties, and specific
surface area tests. It was found that the obtained hydrogels have
the cross-linked three-dimensional porous network nanostructures,
and the formed composite poly-CD/PAA-Azo hydrogel can basically be
shear thinned and have good recovery performance. A process of gel–sol
transition can occur when the gel has a stimulatory response under
UV light irradiation. In addition, such excellent properties of hydrogels
exhibit different mechanisms in the adsorption of organic molecules
that are harmful to the environment, such as bisphenol A (BPA) and
methylene blue (MB). The polymeric hydrogel serves as novel adsorbent
agents to adsorb BPA via host–guest interaction and anchor
MB via electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding.

1 Introduction
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are
macrocyclic oligosaccharides with the special
structure of hydrophobic interior cavity and hydrophilic exterior
ring.1 β-Cyclodextrin is composed
of seven repeated monomers of glucopyranose units linked by α-(1,4)
glycosidic linkages. Due to moderate internal diameter, low price,
and negligible toxicity, β-cyclodextrin-based self-assembled
materials have been intensively investigated in many fields, such
as controlled release drug carriers, self-healing hydrogels, and electrochemical
sensors.2−4 However, native cyclodextrins are unable to incorporate
certain hydrophilic compounds or large molecules. To overcome these
limitations and extend the inclusion capacity, the syntheses of cyclodextrin
polymers are necessary.5,6 Cyclodextrin polymers could be
prepared by reacting cyclodextrins with cross-linking agents, such
as epichlorohydrin, carbonyl compounds (e.g., diphenyl carbonate,
dimethyl carbonate, carbonyldiimidazole), and organic dianhydrides
(e.g., pyromelitic anhydride).7−10 In contrast to CDs, cyclodextrin polymers (poly-CD)
exhibited higher efficiency to accommodate high-weight molecules and
demonstrated higher stability constants since all of the cyclodextrin
units co-operatively participated in the formation process of inclusion
complexes.11−13

Polymeric hydrogel is a series of essential
soft matter with cross-linked
network structure. Stimuli-responsive polymeric hydrogels are significant
at present and have potential applications as “smart”
materials in many areas owing to well responsiveness to environmental
stimuli, such as light, pH, temperature, or solvents.14−16 Compared to the fixed networks constructed by chemical cross-linking,
the stimuli-responsive hydrogels showed temporary physical network,
which could be inversely transformed into solutions by adjusting the
environmental factors.17

Recently,
the supramolecular self-assembled hydrogels via host–guest
interactions between cyclodextrins polymers and guest molecules have
attracted much attention. The hydrophobic cavity of cyclodextrins
can obtain host–guest inclusion complexes with suitable hydrophobic
guest molecules through hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions,
van der Waals forces, and dipole–dipole interactions. Hence,
the host–guest interaction via cyclodextrin can be utilized
to form hydrogel as adsorbent agents to anchor and remove organic
molecules from harmful environment. In addition, bisphenol A (BPA)
is one of hydrophobic contaminants, which comes from food packaging
materials, including epoxy resins and polycarbonates mainly used for
water bottles and tin internal coatings.18 BPA could be removed using cyclodextrin-based hydrogel through the
host–guest interaction to form inclusion complexes. Besides,
methylene blue (MB) is a kind of organic dye from aqueous solution,
which is harmful to the environment. Now many excellent research works
have been achieved about the synthesis of novel composite materials
for MB removal. For examples, Jale et al. reported the synthesis of
carbonized peanut shell as low-cost adsorbent for adsorption of MB.19 Yildiz and co-workers investigated monodisperse
Pt/Rh@GO nanocomposites and their adsorption performances for MB with
adsorption capacity of 346.79 mg/g.20 Han
et al. reported the preparation of flower-like MoS2 nanosheet-based
nanostructure and superior dye-adsorption performance.21 Sert et al. investigated the synthesis of monodisperse
Vulcan carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles via microwave-assisted method
and application for MB removal with remarkable adsorption capacity
of 271.15 mg/g.22

In this present
work, we synthesized cyclodextrin polymers (poly-CD)
by cross-linking agents and fabricated photosensitive supramolecular
polymeric hydrogel via poly-cyclodextrin (poly-CD) and azobenzene-branched
poly(acrylic acid) copolymer (PAA-Azo) to investigate the light-responsive
properties of polymeric hydrogel after UV irradiation. These new sol–gel
switching hydrogel materials through host–guest interactions
could be utilized as light-operated switch and self-healing materials.
Moreover, these polymeric hydrogels served as excellent adsorbent
agents to remove BPA via hydrophobic interaction and MB via electrostatic
interaction and hydrogen bonding, which demonstrated potential applications
in dye removal and wastewater treatment.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization
of Hydrogels
The photographs of as-obtained poly-CD/PAA-Azo
composite hydrogels
are showed in Figure 1. It was observed that all hydrogels perform good gelation stability,
and the gel with lower concentration of poly-CD becomes more transparent
and clearer. To explore the internal structure of the gels, the morphological
and spectral characterizations were performed. Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of poly-CD and PAA-Azo as well as the five groups of hydrogels. The
XRD pattern of pure PAA-Azo has a broad peak with centered position
of 23°, which is mainly attributed to the alkyl main chain in
the PAA molecule. The XRD pattern of poly-CD shows many diffraction
peaks between 2θ values of 10–25° indicating the
amorphous state of the cyclodextrin polymer. For the five groups of
hydrogels, the obtained XRD patterns of Gel-A and Gel-B are similar
to poly-CD, indicating that the concentrations of poly-CD in the hydrogels
were excessive. Compared to the formed Gel-C, Gel-D, and Gel-E, the
diffraction peaks assigned to poly-CD almost disappeared and there
appeared the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ value of
19.4°, which indicated that the special interaction occurred
in the hydrogels (Table 1).

PAA-Azo in Hydrogels

Gel-C	25:0.8	25:1	
Gel-D	12.5:0.8	25:1	
Gel-E	6.25:0.8	25:1	
The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of
the five groups
of hydrogels are shown in Figure 3. The characteristic peak at 3350 cm–1 was mainly owing to the stretching vibration peaks of −OH,
−COOH, and H–OH groups. As for poly-CD, the peak at
2915 cm–1 was assigned to the −CH2 group, which is due to the introduction of the epichlorohydrin as
a cross-linking agent. And the peaks at 1650, 1150, and 1095 cm–1 originated from C=H bonds, C=O bonds,
and C–OH bonds, respectively, which indicated the good hydrophilicity
of poly-CD.23−25 The characteristic peaks at 1015 and 910 cm–1 are attributed to the vibration peaks of the C–O–C
bond and the α-1,4 glycosidic bond on the cyclodextrin backbone,
respectively. In addition, the above characteristic peaks also appeared
in the FT-IR spectra of hydrogels with different concentrations, and
the newly appearing characteristic peaks at 1730 and 1660 cm–1 were attributed to the stretching vibration peaks of carbonyl and
amide bonds, respectively. Therefore, the present obtained FT-IR data
demonstrated the successful synthesis of composite materials between
poly-CD and PAA-Azo, which occurs through the linkage of amide bonds.
It should be noted that due to the component of poly-CD solution with
maximum concentration of 100 mg/mL, the formed Gel-A demonstrate cloudy
state with a few aggregates, which can be seen in photograph of hydrogels
in Figure 1. The concentration
ratio of the Gel-E was the minimum gelation concentration between
poly-CD and PAA-Azo. Thus, the formed Gel-B and Gel-E were selected
as representatives for the next characterization investigation.

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra
of poly-CD, PAA-Azo, and composite hydrogels with
different concentration ratios.

It could be seen that the micro/nanosized morphologies of
the Gel-B
and Gel-E hydrogels are demonstrated in Figure 4. The cross-linked network-like hydrogel
system could be formed under the dispersion medium, and the microscopic
size changed from several micrometers to hundreds of nanometers. Comparison
of Gel-B and Gel-E, it was found that the pore structure existed both
in the Gel-B and Gel-E. Due to the poly-CD concentration in Gel-E
was lower than that in Gel-B, so the more porous structures and larger
specific surface area were appeared in Gel-E than that in Gel-B. The
porous microstructures of the hydrogels were further investigated
by utilizing the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms,
and the pore size distributions of poly-CD/PAA-Azo hydrogels were
calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method
shown in Figure 5.
In the range of relative pressures from 0 to 1, Gel-E shows the hysteresis
loops of typical IV isothermal curves at the p/p0 = 0.3–0.7, indicating that the mesoporous
structures exist in the Gel-E.26−28 Thus, Gel-E demonstrated more
pores and larger specific area than Gel-B. In addition, the BJH method
was used to calculate the specific surface areas of the two groups
of gels, as shown in Table 2, where the physical properties of nitrogen adsorption and
desorption are shown. It can be clearly observed that the specific
surface areas of hydrogels in Gel-B and Gel-E are 66.148 and 68.184
m2/g, respectively, whereas the average pore diameters
are 4.886 and 5.225 nm, respectively, and the average pore volumes
are 0.077253 and 0.086408 cm3/g. The higher specific surface
areas and larger pore diameters and pore volumes can be expected to
enhance the enveloped capacity of the organic molecules.

Figure 6 demonstrates
the thermograms of the prepared hydrogels under nitrogen conditions.
It could be observed that the first weight loss of four curves was
around at 100 °C. This can be normally explained by the removal
and evaporation of surface-adsorbed water molecules. From the thermogravimetric
curves of PAA-Azo, it can be seen that PAA-Azo mainly loses weight
in two stages of 190 and 480 °C, which is mainly owing to the
decomposition of the alkyl backbone of PAA molecules and the azobenzene
group organics. As for poly-CD, the weight loss of 62% at 300 °C
was attributed to the thermal decomposition of cyclodextrin oligosaccharides.29−33 In addition, from the thermogravimetric plots of poly-CD/PAA-Azo
hydrogels of Gel-B and Gel-E, it can be seen that there is approximately
10% weight loss between 100–300 °C, which is attributed
to poly-CD molecules and the thermal decomposition of alkyl chains
in PAA-Azo molecules; and the mass loss approximately 55% between
300 and 400 °C was mainly attributed to the inclusion complexes
of the composite hydrogels became thermal decomposition.

Figure 6 Thermogravimetric
(TG) curves of poly-CD, PAA-Azo, Gel-B, and Gel-E.

The rheological behavior of two kinds of obtained
hydrogels was
characterized, considering the dependence of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″)
on angular frequency (ω). The storage modulus G′ represents the elastic part of stored energy in material
and also becomes the elastic modulus; the loss modulus G″ reflects the viscosity and energy loss of the material and
also becomes the viscous modulus. Comparing Figure 7a,b, the G′ and G″ values of the Gel-B and Gel-E are equal at shear
stresses of 1.02 and 0.43%, respectively. This shows that the Gel-B
has relatively wider viscoelastic region and shear strength relative
to the Gel-E. At a shear stress of 0.001%, the frequency-dependent
oscillating shear rheological behavior of the obtained gels was measured
in Figure 7c,d. It
was found that G′ dominated the detected frequency
range, exhibiting the true gel-state behavior.34−37 From the Figure 7e,f curves, it can be seen that the two groups
of gels can basically be shear thinned and have good recovery performance.

characterizations of Gel-B (a, c, and e) and Gel-E
(b, d, and f) hydrogels.

The photoisomerization performances of the azobenzene group
were
studied using the minimum gel formation concentration of Gel-E, as
shown in Figure 8. Figure 8a shows the Gel-E
placed in a quartz cell, and the hydrogel would be exposed to UV light
at different time intervals with 365 nm UV lamp in dark conditions.
The UV–vis spectra were measured with the irradiation time
of 0 s, 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min, as shown in Figure 8c. Observing the
UV–vis spectra of the Gel-E before irradiation, it can be found
that the absorption peaks appear at 221, 282, and 433 nm. The characteristic
peak at 348 nm was attributed to the π–π* transfer
of the azobenzene trans-isomer, whereas the n−π*
transfer of the cis-isomer was at 438 nm. With the
increase of the irradiation time, the intensity of the π–π*
transfer peak gradually decreased and the position of the peak became
slowly blue shifts, at the same time, the intensity of the n−π*
transfer peak gradually increased. The equilibrium state was basically
reached after 5 min of irradiation, indicating that the cis and trans isomers of azobenzene group almost reached
equilibrium at this time. Figure 8d is a comparison of circular dichroism (CD) spectra
before and after UV light illumination. It could be seen that the
hydrogel had a good chiral signal before illumination, indicating
that the azobenzene group and the β-CD group in the poly-CD/PAA-Azo
hydrogel have the host–guest reaction. The host–guest
recognition had formed in a hydrogel system with a stable cross-networking
structure. Compared with the CD spectra of the 10 min UV light, the
chiral signal was weaker and almost disappeared. This indicated that
UV light make the azobenzene group change from trans-isomer to cis-isomer. The conformational conversion
of isomer caused the partial host–guest interactions of azobenzene
group and β-CD groups to be disassembled, and the stable system
of hydrogels was conversed to a sol state macroscopically, as shown
in the photograph of Figure 8b.

2.2 Adsorption
Performances toward Dye Removal
On the basis of the above
characterization analysis, we know that
the obtained hydrogels have porous nanostructure and large specific
surface area. So, the adsorption properties of present obtained gels
to bisphenol A and organic dyes were researched. The Gel-E was chosen
as the typical adsorbent to selectively remove MB and BPA mainly owing
to the larger specific surface area and more porous structures. The
adsorption kinetics was carefully investigated by fitting experimental
data with the pseudo-first-order model and pseudo-second-order model
adsorption equation, as shown in Figure 9. Classical kinetic models were utilized
to show the above adsorption mechanism as follows:

Figure 9 Kinetic adsorptions of
(a) qt versus t plots
and (b) t/qt versus t plots for BPA and MB.

The pseudo-first-order model can be showed by eq 1 1  The pseudo-second-order model can be showed
by eq 2 2  where qe represents
the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe and qt represents the adsorption capacity
at time t and the k1 and k2 values represent the kinetic rate constants.38,39 The kinetic results are calculated and summarized in Table 3, and demonstrated that the
pseudo-two-order model showed a higher correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.99) in MB adsorption process, whereas
the pseudo-first-order model seemed more accurate (R2 > 0.99) in BPA adsorption process. Thus, it was hypothesized
that Gel-E exhibited the different mechanisms in removal of MB and
BPA. In addition, the fitted removal efficiency of Gel-E for MB reached
85.3248 mg/g, whereas for the BPA system, the calculated removal efficiency
showed value of 20.7297 mg/g. It should be noted that from previous
reports, the removal efficiencies of MB from different composite materials,
including sandwiched Fe3O4/carboxylate graphene
oxide nanostructure, polydopamine sheathed electrospun nanofibers,
and diamond based core–shell nanocomposites, showed the value
range of 34–40 mg/g.40−42 In addition, some two-component
supramolecular gels based on glutamic acid component and graphene
oxide hydrogels demonstrated the maximum removal values of 16.898
and 334.448 mg/g for MB removal.43,44 Thus, present
obtained composite gel materials exhibited excellent removal capacities
for MB molecules. Moreover, durability and regeneration of absorbent
materials seemed very important in real industrial application. Different
composite systems mentioned above can be reused several times or recycled
in a controlled way, demonstrating long use in wastewater purification.45,46 However, as for present composite hydrogel materials, due to the
mass losses of poly-CD and PAA-Azo components in the regeneration
process by washing with organic solvents, the durability and reusability
performance do not seem promising.

MB	85.3248	0.96126	3.2181 × 10–3	84.1750	0.99914	5.4157 × 10–3	
It is well known that cyclodextrin-based compounds
also have a
good affinity for the binding of BPA mainly due to host–guest
interaction, so they can be utilized as specific host molecules for
anchoring and removal of BPA from wasterwater.47 On the other hand, MB belong to a positively charged organic
molecule, which interacts with many adsorbents through electrostatic
attraction and hydrogen binding.41,42 Therefore,
present prepared hydrogel materials could remove both kinds of organic
molecules with good removal efficiency, which was reasonably attributed
to different removal mechanisms. As shown in Figure 10, the prepared gels served as adsorbent
agents to anchor MB via electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding
by functional carboxyl groups linked in molecular skeletons, which
demonstrated high removal efficiency mainly due to porous structures
and numerous chemical active sites to anchor MB molecules. In addition,
the differences of assembly modes in the Gel-E and BPA are exhibited
in Figure 10b. BPA
molecules could be embedded on the cavity of CD in gel systems via
host–guest interactions, showing a versatile adsorption process.
It can be expected that the current obtained composite hydrogel materials
can be used for potential extensive applications in fields of nanocomposite
materials and environmental engineering, demonstrating new clues for
the design and preparation of β-CD-based hydrogels.

(a) and BPA (b).

3 Conclusions
In summary, new composite hydrogel materials based on poly-CD and
PAA-Azo polymers were prepared, and the dye removal capacities of
the hydrogels were studied. Various poly-CD/PAA-Azo composite hydrogels
with different concentrations ratios were prepared, demonstrating
gel–sol conversion process due to the cis–trans isomerization of azobenzene group. The maximum removal
efficiency of present obtained gel reached 85.3248 mg/g for MB and
20.7297 mg/g for BPA, demonstrating excellent anchoring capacities.
The prepared gels served as adsorbent agents to anchor MB via electrostatic
interaction and hydrogen bonding by functional carboxyl groups linked
in molecular skeletons. And the removal of BPA molecules could be
attributed to host–guest interactions with versatile adsorption
process. Present research work showed new exploration of composite
hydrogels used as composite absorbent materials for applications in
environmental engineering and wastewater treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
β-Cyclodextrin
(β-CD,
98%), epichlorohydrin (99%), 4-aminoazobenzene (N-Azo), and poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA, average MW ∼ 450 000) were obtained from
Alfa Aesar (Tianjin, China) Chemicals, Aladdin Reagent Chemicals (Shanghai,
China), and TCI Shanghai Chemicals without further purification. N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. Methylene blue (MB)
and bisphenol A (BPA) were purchased from Beijing Chemicals with analytical
reagent grade. The used other reagents, such as toluene and isopropanol,
were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. with analytical
reagent grade. All aqueous solutions were obtained with water from
a double-stage Millipore Milli-Q Plus purification system.

4.2 Preparation of Hydrogels
First, poly(β-cyclodextrin)
(poly-CD) was synthesized according to the literature.48−50 The final white product solid was obtained after freeze–drying
process. The azobenzene-branched poly(acrylic acid) copolymer (PAA-Azo)
was prepared according to our previous work.51 Then, aqueous poly-CD solutions with various concentrations (100,
50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 mg/mL) were prepared and continuously stirred
at room temperature until poly-CD molecules was completely dissolved
into ultrapure water. Aqueous PAA-Azo solution (10 mg/mL) was also
prepared and fully dissolved by sonication for 2–3 min. Then,
1 mL of PAA-Azo solutions was mixed with the different concentrations
0.8 mL of poly-CD solutions, respectively. After sonication for 30
min, the gelation states were formed. The detailed formulations are
shown in Table 1, and
the prepared samples of hydrogels were named as Gel-A, Gel-B, Gel-C,
Gel-D, and Gel-E. It should be mentioned that the concentration ratio
of the Gel-E was also the minimum gelation concentration between poly-CD
and PAA-Azo.

4.3 Adsorption Experiments
Adsorption
performances were performed by utilizing two typical organic molecules,
methylene blue (MB) and bisphenol A (BPA). The UV–vis absorption
spectra were monitored for the adsorption process at wavelengths of
276 nm (BPA) and 632 nm (MB) using a 752-type UV–vis spectrometer
(Sunny Hengping scientific instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).
Required solution of BPA was prepared from 1 mg/mL of stock prepared
in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide solution. About 1 mL of as-obtained poly-CD/PAA-Azo
hydrogel was added to 20 mL of BPA solution with 25 mg/L concentration
at room temperature. Corresponding to the hydrogel was added to 100
mL of MB solution (5 mg/L) at room temperature. The absorbances were
monitored at different time intervals and then calculated and fitted
using the calibration curves.

4.4 Characterization
The xerogels were
acquired via FD-1C-50 lyophilizer (Beijing Boyikang Experimental Instrument
Co., Ltd., China) to completely remove water over 2–3 days.
The morphology of the hydrogels was characterized via a field-emission
scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800II, Hitachi, Japan) with
5–15 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray diffraction patterns were
investigated on an X-ray diffractometer (SMART LAB, Rigaku) using
Cu Kα X-ray radiation. FT-IR spectra were carried out by a Fourier
infrared spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet Corporation) by the conventional
KBr disk tablet method. The specific surface areas and pore diameter
distributions were measured by using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
measurements (NOVA 4200-P). Thermogravimetries (TG) were conducted
by a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxxsi multaneous thermal analyzer (Netzsch
Instruments Manufacturing Co, Ltd, Germany) in argon gas atmosphere.
UV–vis absorption spectra were investigated on a Shimadzu UV-2550
system (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra
were obtained by a JASCO J-810 CD spectrometer. Dynamic rheology experiments
were measured with an Anton Paar MCR302 rheometer at room temperature.
