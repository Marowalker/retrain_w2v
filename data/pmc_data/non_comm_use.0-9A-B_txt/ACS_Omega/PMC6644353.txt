Polymers
or small molecules with functional groups were always
employed to synthesize two-dimensional (2D) silver nanostructures,
but the polysaccharides and derivatives have rarely been used for
their preparation, let alone of uniform quadrilateral shapes. Herein,
amylopectin derivatives containing concentrated carboxyl groups were
first used for the synthesis of uniform 2D quadrilateral silver nanoplates
(QAgNPs) with lamellar structure. As a native hyperbranched polysaccharide,
amylopectin was esterified with 10-undecenoyl chloride and then modified
via thiol–ene click chemistry to introduce high amount and
high density of carboxyl groups. Then, QAgNPs were synthesized via
UV photoreduction in the presence of the resultant amylopectin 11-((3-carboxyl)ethylthio)undecanoate
(APUE3-MPA) in water–tetrahydrofuran binary system.
QAgNPs showed novel uniform quadrilateral shapes with lamellar structure,
as verified by their wide-angle X-ray scattering patterns. The average
interlayer distance was around 1.3 nm, whereas the average edge lengths
of QAgNPs varied between 0.29 ± 0.07 and 1.09 ± 0.25 μm.
The concentration of APUE3-MPA and the amount of water
in the reaction system strongly affected the shapes of QAgNPs. Thus,
the reaction system and the arrangement of numerous carboxyl groups
were the key factors for the formation of lamellar-structured QAgNPs.

Introduction
Nanosilver with various
shapes including nanoparticles, nanowires,
nanobelts, and nanoplates has been extensively investigated for the
past decades because of their wide potential applications in many
fields, such as catalysis, optoelectronic devices, and chemical and
biological sensing.1−8 Among these silver nanostructures, two-dimensional (2D) silver nanostructures
have attracted particular attention, motivated by their unique and
interesting optical properties.9−11 For instance, the extinction
peak of silver nanospheres with the diameter of 40 nm is located at
about 400 nm. Only small shifts of the peak could be observed via
changing the size of the silver nanospheres.12 In contrast, silver nanoplates could display resonance in the near-infrared
range (NIR),13 which endows them with the
ability of being used in optical communication, photodynamic therapy,
and biological imaging because of the deeper penetration depth of
the NIR light.14 Moreover, the resonance
wavelength could be tuned in a wide range by changing the shape and
size of the silver nanoplates. Various methods have been developed
for synthesizing 2D silver nanostructures. Generally, various synthetic
polymers, such as polyacrylamide (PAM), polyacrylic acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
or small molecules with functional groups (carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl
groups) were used for this purpose because they can selectively adsorb
on certain crystal facets or be utilized as templates during the synthesis
process. These properties can promote the anisotropic growth, thus
facilitating the formation of 2D silver nanostructures.10,15,16

Citrate was once recognized
as the key component for producing
of silver nanoplates until it was reported to be replaced by many
other di- and tricarboxylate compounds with two or three carboxylate
groups.17 The presence of high density
of carboxylate or amino groups seems to be advantageous for the synthesis
of 2D silver nanostructures. Xie et al. systematically studied the
synthesis of silver nanostructures using peptides with different ratios
of carboxylic groups to per peptide unit.18 Peptides without a carboxyl group resulted in irregularly shaped
and spherical Ag nanocrystals, whereas higher yield of 2D Ag nanoplates
was obtained using peptides with more carboxyl groups per unit. The
selective adsorption of carboxyl groups to certain crystallographic
planes and the moderation of the Ag+ reduction kinetics
via the interaction with carboxyl groups jointly facilitate the formation
of silver nanoplates. Xiong and co-workers reported that PAM could
assist the formation of silver nanoplates through mediating the reduction
rate via the complex formed between Ag+ and amino groups
of PAM.15 Other carboxyl or amino groups
containing polymers, for instance, surface-carboxylated polystyrene
spheres were also used as templates to synthesize silver nanodisks.19 In addition, 2D silver nanostructures have also
been prepared via the self-assembly of silver nanoparticles. For example,
silver nanoparticles capped with various alkanethiols have been reported
for the formation of 2D superlattice via a self-assembly process.20,21 Thiolate-protected silver nanocrystals were also reported as the
assembly components to fabricate 2D silver nanostructures. Jia et
al. investigated the synthesis of self-assembled thiolated silver
nanocrystals with lamellar structures.22 The results showed that the intriguing photophysical properties
of the self-assembled silver nanocrystals are closely related to their
lamellar superstructures. Li and Wang also reported the self-assembly
of p-aminothiophenol (PATP)-capped silver nanocrystals
into lamellar-structured nanoleaves and proposed their potential applications
as “molecular junctions”.23

Over the past decade, much effort has been devoted to the
synthesis
of metal nanostructures via the assistance of natural polymers, such
as cellulose, starch, chitin, alginate, and their derivatives, owing
to their biodegradability, sustainability, and versatile modifications.24−29 However, zero-dimensional nanoparticles were always obtained in
these previous studies. Employing native polymers to assist the preparation
of 2D silver nanostructures was rarely reported. Until recently, Tufenkji
and co-workers reported the synthesis of silver nanostructures in
various shapes by irradiating the aqueous solution of AgNO3 with suspended cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) using UV light.30 The results showed that the carboxyl content
of CNC had a great effect on the shapes of the obtained silver nanostructures.
Triangular silver nanoplates were obtained with CNC containing low
contents of carboxyl groups. Higher contents of carboxyl groups resulted
in a mixture of hexagonal nanosheets and flowerlike/dendric structures.
Although this work showed the possibility of forming 2D silver nanostructures
with the assistance of CNC, silver nanoplates with uniform shapes
could not be obtained. Until now, to our best knowledge, native polysaccharides,
such as starch, cellulose and chitin as well as their derivatives
have never been reported to be used for the synthesis of uniform 2D
silver nanoplates, let alone of lamellar structures.

Compared
with cellulose and other native polymers, amylopectin
is a native polysaccharide with a hyperbranched structure and many
branched chains.31,32 Because of the presence of numerous
hydroxyl groups within a much more compact space in comparison with
linear polymers or most other polysacchrides, a wide variety of functional
groups in a high density can be introduced onto its backbone.33

Herein, amylopectin derivatives, namely
amylopectin 11-((3-carboxyl)ethylthio)undecanoate–3-mercaptopropionic
acid (APUE3-MPA) was obtained after the esterification
of amylopectin with 10-undecenoyl chloride and further modification
with MPA via thiol–ene click chemistry. Then, quadrilateral
silver nanoplates (QAgNPs) were synthesized via the UV-induced photoreduction
of AgNO3 in the presence of APUE3-MPA, which
acted as both stabilizer and mediator to control the shape of the
silver nanoplates. Finally, the structure and morphology of the obtained
silver nanoplates was systematically analyzed.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of APUE3-MPA
The synthesis
of APUE3-MPA and APUE3-MPA-stabilized
QAgNPs is shown schematically in Figure 1a. APUE3-MPA with a high density
of carboxyl groups were obtained via the total esterification of amylopectin
with 10-undecenoyl chloride and then modified with MPA via the UV-initiated
thiol–ene click reaction (Figure 1b). Compared with the Fourier-tansform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of amylopectin (Figure 1c), APUE3 showed the new FTIR
peaks at 1745 cm–1 ascribed to C=O stretching
vibration and at 1644 cm–1 because of vibrations
of vinyl groups, while the band at 3292 cm–1 ascribed
to vibrations of hydroxyl groups disappeared. Thus, all hydroxyl groups
were totally substituted by 10-undecenoyl groups.34 According to elemental analysis, the average degree of
substitution (DS) ascribed to 10-undecenoyl groups was 3, which was
in accordance with the results obtained from FTIR. The slight decrease
of the signal intensity attributed to the vibrations of alkene C=C
at 1644 cm–1. The emergence of a new broad band
between 3160 and 3400 cm–1 because of O–H
stretching vibrations of the carboxyl groups shown in the FTIR spectrum
of APUE3-MPA indicated a partial modification of C=C
bonds with MPA. The average DS ascribed to MPA groups was determined
to be 0.99 using elemental analysis.

of QAgNPs stabilized
by AUPE3-MPA. (b) Chemical structure of APUE3-MPA. (c) FTIR spectra of amylopectin, APUE3 and APUE3-MPA. (d) Thermogravimetric curves of amylopectin, APUE3 and APUE3-MPA.

The thermal properties of amylopectin, APUE3,
and APUE3-MPA were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)
(Figure 1d). After
the esterification, the degradation onset temperature increased from
300 °C (amylopectin) to about 377 °C (APUE3).
The enhanced thermal stability of APUE3 is ascribed to
the total substitution of the hydroxyl groups by more stable alkane
chains.35 In comparison, APUE3-MPA showed a lower degradation onset temperature (349 °C) than
that of APUE3, which is ascribed to introduced carboxyl
groups. The carboxyl groups can decarboxylate on heating, thus lower
the thermal stability of APUE3-MPA.36

Synthesis of QAgNPs Stabilized by APUE3-MPA
As mentioned above, the formation of 2D silver
nanoplates can be
facilitated by carboxyl groups of a high density. Thus, APUE3-MPA with carboxyl groups of a high density were further employed
to synthesize silver nanoplates.

By using 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solution of APUE3-MPA with various concentrations
and 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.02 M), QAgNPs were
primarily obtained according to their transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images (Figure 2). Using the APUE3-MPA/THF solution with a low concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL, only aggregated silver nanoparticles were formed (Figure 2a). When the concentration
of APUE3-MPA was increased to 0.5 mg/mL (Figure 2b), silver nanoplates with
the regular quadrilateral shape were observed. By increasing the concentration
of APUE3-MPA solutions to 1 mg/mL (Figure 2c), 2 mg/mL (Figure 2d) and 4 mg/mL (Figure 2e), silver nanoplates with similar quadrilateral
shapes but distinct sizes were generated. The average edge lengths
(Figure S1) of silver nanoplates shown
in Figure 2b–e
were 0.29 ± 0.07, 0.60 ± 0.09, 0.73 ± 0.13 and 0.70
± 0.14 μm, respectively. Furthermore, although the QAgNPs
shown in Figure 2c,d
have similar average edge lengths, solutions with higher concentrations
of APUE3-MPA resulted in broader size distributions.

Figure 2 TEM images
of silver nanoplates prepared with 1 mL of 0.02 M aqueous
AgNO3 solution and 10 mL of THF solutions of APUE3-MPA with various concentrations: (a) 0.1; (b) 0.5; (c) 1; (d) 2;
(e) 4 mg/mL. (f) Control sample prepared with 1 mL of AgNO3 (0.02 M) and 10 mL of THF solution of APUE3 instead of
APUE3-MPA (2 mg/mL). Reaction time: 2 h.

In comparison, control experiment using 10 mL of
APUE3 solution (2 mg/mL) and 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution
(0.02 M) only resulted in silver nanospheres with the sizes of several
dozens of nanometers (Figure 2f). This result is also in accordance with the general formation
of zero-dimensional silver nanostructures in an aqueous reaction system,
such as using other native polymers (sodium alginate and starch) or
synthetic polymers without or without enough carboxyl groups.18,24,37−39 These results
indicate that the existence of a high-density carboxyl groups in APUE3-MPA facilitated the formation of QAgNPs. Moreover, the sizes
of the resultant QAgNPs were greatly affected by the concentration
of APUE3-MPA, which allows the adjustment of the sizes
of QAgNPs.

Furthermore, the state of APUE3-MPA in
the mixture exhibited
a great effect on the formation of the silver nanostructures. The
addition of water (as a poor solvent) in 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution to THF solutions of APUE3-MPA (Figure S2a) generally lead to white aggregation
of APUE3-MPA in the mixture. This aggregation should in
fact be unfavorable for the formation of silver nanostructures with
any uniform regular shape. In contrast, regular quadrilateral shape
was obtained as shown above using APUE3-MPA as the polymeric
matrix, in particular, if its amount was sufficient. As the silver
nitrate aqueous solution was added, the hydrophilic carboxyl groups
were rearranged to expose to the water phase and provided nucleation
sites for the formation of silver nanostructures. The dispersion became
light yellow during the proceeding reaction (Figure S2b), which indicated the formation of the silver nanostructures.
At low concentrations, APUE3-MPA (0.1 mg/mL) could not
provide enough carboxyl groups for the formation of platelike silver
nanostructures. As the concentration of APUE3-MPA increased
up to a certain extent (0.5 mg/mL or more), uniform quadrilateral-shaped
silver nanoplates were obtained (Figure 2b–e). This is predominantly because
of the presence of a high density of carboxyl groups which are exposed
to the water phase during the aggregation of APUE3-MPA
chains.40,41 The aggregated APUE3-MPA should
have provided sufficient carboxyl groups as nucleation sites for the
formation of silver nanoplates. Considering the amphiphilic property
of the as-prepared APUE3-MPA and the water–THF binary
reaction system, the amount of added water strongly affected the formation
of QAgNPs. The effects of a few critical parameters including the
reaction time and the amount of water will be discussed further below.

The WAXD pattern of QAgNPs prepared with 10 mL of APUE3-MPA/THF solution (2 mg/mL) and 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution
(0.02 M) for 2 h indicates the presence of lamellar structures inside
the nanoplates, as revealed by 10 significant periodic diffraction
peaks between 6.6 and 70° (Figure 3a). The average interlayer distance (Table S1) was calculated to be 1.342 ± 0.002 nm (Figure 3b). The formation
of the lamellar-structured silver nanoleaves has been reported via
a self-assembly method.23 The presynthesized
silver nanoparticles were first etched by PATP into silver nanoclusters
(Ag25). Then, the formed Ag25–PATP–Ag25 complexes self-assembled into lamellar-structured 2D silver
nanoleaves driven by the π–π stacking force and
the strong dipole–dipole interaction between the neighboring
benzene rings of PATP. In contrary, lamellar-structured silver nanoplates
have never been synthesized with the assistance of polysaccharides
and their derivatives.

solution with the concentration of 2 mg/mL and 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.02 M). Reaction time was 2 h. (b) The average
interlayer spacing calculated according to Bragg’s law.

The chemical surface analysis
was performed by using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 4a–c shows the detailed spectra of C 1s, S 2p, and Ag
3d of QAgNPs prepared in 2 h with 10 mL of APUE3-MPA/THF
solution (2 mg/mL) and 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.02
M). For the identification of the chemical states, the spectra were
shifted to the main peak of C 1s at 284.6 eV.42 The C 1s peaks (Figure 4a) show the presence of four components. The main peak corresponds
to C=C and C–C bonds, with a full width at half maximum
(fwhm) of 1.3. The peak at 285.7 eV (fwhm of 1.5) indicates the presence
of C–O and C–S bonds.43,44 The fourth
peak at 288.9 eV with a fwhm of 1.4 can be assigned to the carboxyl
group (O–C=O).45 The peak
at 286.9 eV with a fwhm of 1.5 can be interpreted as the carbon of
the carbonyl groups.46 The sulfur 2p (Figure 4b) exhibits a doublet
arising from the two spin–orbit split S 2p3/2 and
S 2p1/2 spectra features at a binding energy 162.0 and
163.1 eV with an fwhm of 1.14 and 1.52, respectively. The presence
of these signals indicates the interaction between sulfur and carbon
(C–S–C).47 Two peaks ascribed
to Ag 3d were identified at 368.3 and 376.4 eV both with a fwhm of
1.3 (Figure 4c). These
peaks are attributed to the two spin–orbit coupling of Ag 3d
into Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2. On the basis of
the peak position of Ag 3d5/2 at 368.3 eV and Ag 3d3/2 at 376.4 eV, it can be concluded that elemental silver
[Ag(0)] was present in the samples.48

To monitor the formation
process of QAgNPs, diverse QAgNPs were
prepared with 10 mL of THF solution of APUE3-MPA (2 mg/mL)
and 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.02 M), whereas the
reaction times were varied between 20 s and 5 h. The samples were
immediately processed and measured on TEM, as shown for the reaction
times of 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 60 min, 2 h, and 5 h (Figure 5). It can be seen
from Figure 5a that
silver nanoparticles with sizes of several nanometers were formed
already at the beginning (20 s) of the reaction. Embryonic platelike
nanostructures were constructed, when the reaction was prolonged to
40 s (Figure 5b). Nanoplates
were already present after 1 min reaction, indicating a fast formation
process of potential silver nanoplates. When the time increased to
5 min, more silver nanoplates with regular quadrilateral shape were
generated. This indicates a fast reduction of silver ions (at least
fivefolds) occurred in our reaction system in comparison with previous
work, for example, the CNCs-assisted photoreduction synthesis of anisotropic
silver nanoparticles.30 Furthermore, with
further increase of the reaction time, no obvious change of the shapes
was observed. In contrast, the average lateral length of QAgNPs varied
depending on the reaction time. According to the statistical result
(Figure S3), the average lateral lengths
of the silver nanoplates obtained for 5, 10, and 60 min were 1.09
± 0.25, 1.02 ± 0.19, and 1.03 ± 0.19 μm, respectively,
whereas longer reaction time resulted in a slight decrease in average
lateral edge length (0.73 ± 0.13 and 0.79 ± 0.14 μm
for silver nanoplates prepared for 2 and 5 h, respectively).

of QAgNPs prepared with 10 mL of THF solution of APUE3-MPA
(2 mg/mL) and 1 mL of aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.02 M)
after distinct reaction times: (a) 20 s; (b) 40 s; (c)
1 min; (d) 5 min; (e) 10 min; (f) 60 min; (g) 2 h; and (h) 5 h. Scale
bars: 200 nm in (a//b) as well as 1 μm in (c–h).

When AgNO3 solution
was added into the THF solution
of APUE3-MPA, silver ions would complex with the carboxyl
groups of APUE3-MPA. At the same time, APUE3-MPA binding with Ag+ formed complexes within the water–THF
binary system. The aggregation of APUE3-MPA induced by
adding water would make more carboxyl groups expose to water phase
and interact with Ag+. The numerous nucleation sites facilitate
the anisotropic growth of QAgNPs. After 1 min UV irradiation, QAgNPs
with obvious quadrilateral shapes already formed. The strategy of
immobilizing silver ions with carboxyl groups containing materials
for further formation of silver nanoparticles have been employed by
many other groups.49−51 In addition, it was reported that UV photoreduction
of Ag+ become easier when Ag+ are bonded to
carboxyl groups.52 Thus, the fast reduction
of Ag+ happened because of the existence of large number
of carboxyl groups on the backbone of APUE3-MPA. Obviously,
uniform QAgNPs formed within shorter time in comparison with the similar
photoreduction method previously reported.30,53

As mentioned above, the role of water in the formation of
QAgNPs
needs to be taken into account because of its influence on the aggregation
of APUE3-MPA, the arrangement of carboxyl groups, and the
dispersion of Ag+. To investigate the effect of added water,
diverse mixtures of water and THF with volume ratios of 1/9 and 5/5
were used as the cosolvent to prepare AgNO3 solution. The
corresponding solutions were denoted as AgNO3-1/9 and AgNO3-5/5. These solutions and the aqueous solution of AgNO3 were further used for the synthesis of silver nanoplates,
while keeping the amount of AgNO3 in each reaction system
constant. By using 10 mL of APUE3-MPA (2 mg/mL) and 1 mL
of AgNO3-1/9 (0.02 M), 1 mL of AgNO3-5/5 (0.02
M) or 2 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.01 M) for the preparation
of silver nanostructures with diverse shapes and sizes were obtained
(Figure 6a–c).
Interestingly, compared with the silver nanoplates (Figures 2d and 5) prepared with 1 mL of AgNO3 aqueous solutions (0.02
M) and 10 mL of APUE3-MPA (2 mg/mL), the silver nanoplates
(Figure 6a–c)
resulted from 1 mL of AgNO3-1/9 (0.02 M), 1 mL of AgNO3-5/5 (0.02 M), or 2 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution
(0.01 M) had more irregular shapes. This difference is ascribed to
the diverse amounts of water used in the reaction systems. Water not
only induced the aggregation of APUE3-MPA to certain extent
but also facilitated the dispersion of the Ag+ and the
arrangement of carboxyl groups via the interaction with water molecules.
With less water (1 mL of AgNO3-1/9 and 1 mL of AgNO3-5/5) in the reaction system, a worse dispersion of Ag+ and less carboxyl groups exposing to water would be expected.
Whereas using 2 mL of AgNO3 aqueous solution (0.01 M),
the APUE3-MPA aggregation would be more. Thus, an inappropriate
amount of water is more likely to result in silver nanoplates with
irregular shapes (Figure 6a–c). In addition, the amount of water also affected
the sizes of the resultant silver nanostructures. The QAgNPs (Figures 2d and 5) have the largest average sizes, whereas the silver nanostructures
prepared with 1 mL of AgNO3-1/9 (Figure 6a) have the smallest average sizes of about
several dozens of nanometers.

Figure 6 TEM images of the samples prepared with 10 mL
of THF solution of
APUE3-MPA (2 mg/mL) and the solution of constant amount
of AgNO3 dissolved in water–THF mixtures with various
volume ratios. The solutions of AgNO3 in water–THF
mixtures were denoted as AgNO3-X/Y: (a) 1 mL of AgNO3-1/9 (0.02 M), (b) 1 mL of
AgNO3-5/5 (0.02 M), and (c) 2 mL of aqueous solution of
AgNO3 (0.01 M, only water as solvent for AgNO3). (d–f) WAXD patterns of the samples (a–c), respectively.

In contrast to the big difference
of shapes, these silver nanostructures
all have similar lamellar structure according to their WAXD patterns
(Figures 3a and 6d–f). However, less periodic peaks were detected
for irregular silver nanostructures (Figure 6d–f) compared with regular QAgNPs
(Figure 3a). The average
interlayer distance (Tables S2–S4) for the silver nanostructures shown in Figure 6a–c was calculated to be 1.343 ±
0.004, 1.342 ± 0.004, and 1.340 ± 0.003 nm, respectively.
Thus, the volume of water present in the reaction system has a great
effect on the shapes of final silver nanostructures, but it only slightly
influences the formation of lamellar structures. In particular, it
should be noted that the mechanism of the reaction in a binary system
resulting in polymeric aggregates was more complicated than using
single-phase homogeneous reaction conditions. Instead, the parallelogram
shapes of obtained QAgNPs are easily formed and can even be tuned
by changing the amount of water in the reaction system. Thus, we presented
herein a novel strategy for preparing a novel group of QAgNPs with
lamellar structures using derivatized native amylopectin as substrates.
Such large QAgNPs are of great interest for diverse potential applications,
such as catalysis, antibacterial surface, and sensing.2,54−56 It should be noted that the aggregation formed within
the binary system greatly hinders the exploration of further potential
applications. Several methods including washing via solvent exchange,
ligand exchange, and acid hydrolysis were not successful to remove
the aggregation of APUE3-MPA, whereas further study is
required to effectively separate QAgNPs from polymer matrix.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized a carboxyl group-rich polymer (APUE3-MPA) derived from amylopectin, a kind of natural hyperbranched
polysaccharide. APUE3-MPA with a high density of carboxyl
groups was utilized to synthesize silver nanostructures in a binary
(water and THF) system. Unlike many other silver nanostructures formed
with the assistance of small molecules, synthetic polymers or polysaccharides,
2D silver nanoplates synthesized in the presence of APUE3-MPA exhibited regular quadrilateral shapes. Obtained QAgNPs has
lamellar structure with an average interlayer spacing of around 1.3
nm, as demonstrated by their WAXD patterns with up to 10 periodic
peaks. In addition, the APUE3-MPA-stabilized QAgNPs have
a lateral size ranging from about 100 nm to more than 1 μm.
Furthermore, we found that the volume of water strongly affected the
shapes of the resultant silver nanoplates. The binary (water–THF)
reaction systems and the presence of carboxyl groups in a high density
were the key factors determining the structures and shapes of QAgNPs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Amylopectin from maize and 10-undecenoyl
chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Silver nitrate (ACS reagent,
≥99.0%) and MPA (≥99.0%) were obtained from Merck KGaA.
All other chemicals of analytical grade were received from VWR (Darmstadt,
Germany) and used without further purification. Ultrapure water was
used for all experiments.

Synthesis of Amylopectin 10-Undecenoyl Ester
with a DS of 3
(APUE3)
Prior to the typical synthesis of APUE3, amylopectin (2 g) was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C
overnight. Then, amylopectin was suspended in 60 mL of pyridine in
a three-neck flask. 10-undecenoyl chloride (16.8 mL) was dropped into
the pyridine suspension of amylopectin under stirring, and the temperature
was raised to 100 °C. After 4 h reaction, the reaction mixture
was poured into 300 mL of ethanol. The precipitate was collected by
centrifugation and redissolved into THF after removing the solvent.
To remove the impurities, the precipitation–redissolution process
was repeated for at least four times. Finally, the obtained APUE3 was dissolved in THF and stocked for further use.

the APUE3-MPA solution in THF was dialyzed in THF for 1
week with refreshment of THF every 24 h.

Synthesis of APUE3-MPA-Stabilized Silver Nanoplates
Silver nanoplates were
synthesized using APUE3-MPA as
stabilizer via UV irradiation, which has proven to be a straightforward
method for synthesizing silver nanostructures.57 Typically, 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.02
M) was added drop by drop within 1 min using a pipette (Eppendorf,
volume 100–1000 μL) to 10 mL of the as-prepared APUE3-MPA/THF solutions (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/mL) under stirring.
Then, the mixtures were exposed to UV light with stirring for 2 h.
To observe the formation process of the silver nanoplates, samples
were also prepared with 1 mL of aqueous AgNO3 solution
(0.02 M) and 10 mL of APUE3-MPA/THF (2 mg/mL) solution
for different reaction times (1, 5, 10, 60 min, 2, and 5 h). In addition,
to investigate the effect of water on the reaction in (water–THF)
binary system, samples were also prepared with 10 mL of APUE3-MPA/THF solution (2 mg/mL) and a constant amount of AgNO3 dissolved in water–THF mixtures with various volume ratios
(water–THF), which were denoted as AgNO3-X/Y: (a) 1 mL of AgNO3-1/9 (0.02
M), (b) 1 mL of AgNO3-5/5 (0.02 M), and (b) 2 mL of aqueous
solution of AgNO3 (0.01 M, only water as solvent for AgNO3), reaction time of 2 h. All of the experiments were conducted
with UV light of 320–400 nm at the intensity of about 100 mW/cm2.

Characterization
Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
APUE3 and APUE3-MPA were precipitated by
adding five times
the volume of ethanol into APUE3/THF and APUE3-MPA/THF solution. The precipitates were collected via centrifugation
at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. The obtained solid APUE3 and APUE3-MPA were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C
overnight prior to the FTIR measurement. FTIR measurements were conducted
on a BRUKER ALPHA FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with
a versatile high throughput ZnSe attenuated total reflection crystal.
Spectra were recorded between 4000 and 400 cm–1 with
a resolution of 4 cm–1 and accumulated 24 scans.

Elemental Analysis
The contents of carbon, hydrogen,
and sulfur were determined with an Elemental Analyser 4.1 vario EL
III (Elementar, Germany). The total DS was calculated according to
the reference previously reported.27

Thermogravimetric Analysis
TGA was performed under
nitrogen flow of 20 mL/min using a Netzsch TG209 instrument. Samples
of about 10 mg in crucibles were treated from 20 to 700 °C at
a heating rate of 20 °C/min.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM observation was
performed under 120 kV using a CM 12 TEM (Philips, Netherland). Obtained
QAgNP dispersions stabilized by APUE3-MPA were diluted
fivefold with THF, before a drop of each diluted QAgNPs dispersion
was placed onto the copper grid. After that, the sample was dried
at ambient temperature.

Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction
WAXD
measurements were
conducted on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range of 4°–80°
at a scanning rate of 2°/min with the scan interval of 0.05°.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The XPS measurements
were performed on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe II (ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki,
Japan) with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation with a spot size
of 200 μm and a photon energy of 1486.6 eV. Detailed spectra
were captured at a pass energy of 46.95 eV and a step size of 0.1
eV for carbon (C 1s), silver (Ag 3d), and sulfur (S 2p).
