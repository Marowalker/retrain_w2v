Forward osmosis (FO) has emerged
as a new technology for desalination
and exhibits potentials for applications where reverse osmosis is
incapable or uneconomical for treating streams with high salinity
or fouling propensity. However, most of current draw agents in FO
are salts and difficult to be recycled cost- and energy-effectively.
In this work, we demonstrate a new and facile approach to efficiently
recover water from the FO process with enhanced water purity by using
a binary ion liquid/hydrogel system. The hybrid ion liquid/hydrogel
draw solution system demonstrated in this work synergistically leverages
the thermoresponsive properties of both the ionic liquid (IL) and
hydrogel to improve the overall FO performance. Our findings corroborate
that the hydrogel mitigates the water flux decline of the IL as the
draw agent and provide a ready route to contiguously and effectively
regenerate water from the FO process. Such a route allows for an efficient
recovery of water from the draw solute/water mixture with enhanced
water purity, compared with conventional thermal treating of lower
critical solution temperature IL draw solute/water. Furthermore, hydrogels
can be used in a continuous and readily recyclable process to recover
water without heating the entire draw solute/water mixture. Our design
principles open the door to use low-grade/waste heat or solar energy
to regenerate draw agents and potentially reduce energy in the FO
process considerably.

Introduction
The rising global demand
for unconventional water resources due
to rapid population expansion, urban development, industrialization,
and climate change has urged global scientists to multidirectionally
leverage first-principles scientific innovations toward a future of
sustainable water and energy.1,2 Oftentimes, the critical
challenge lies at the codependent relationship between water and energy.
In essence, early-stage innovative technologies need to couple energy
frameworks into the big picture. For desalination, the current leading
technology is reverse osmosis (RO), a pressure-driven membrane-based
separation process where water is allowed to pass through a semipermeable
membrane that rejects salts. With the advent of technologies in high-performance
membranes, energy recovery devices, and efficient pumps, seawater
RO (SWRO) now consumes much less energy than thermal desalination
and has been the benchmark for any new desalination technology.3 Still, SWRO plants consume 3–4 times the
theoretical minimum energy for desalination because of the need of
extensive pre- and post-treatment processes.3 Furthermore, being highly dependent on thermoelectric energy as
the main power source, SWRO inevitably creates a non-negligible carbon
footprint which further exacerbates climate change and intensifies
the ecological imbalance.

To augment freshwater sources, any
low-quality water sources should
be considered. For local areas where access to a cumbersome SWRO plant
is impossible, a mobile and compact system that can be flexibly plugged
in at the point-of-use and does not require high-grade energy is a
must, that is, when emerging technologies such as solar-assisted portable
systems (e.g., solar humidification/dehumidification desalination,
solar pond, and solar still), membrane distillation, (electro)adsorption,
and forward osmosis (FO) come into play, each of which has its own
pros and cons.4,5 Being spontaneously driven by
a chemical potential (i.e., osmotic pressure difference) created by
two solutions with different salinities across a semipermeable membrane,
FO is considered as a potentially viable energy-efficient desalination
technology6 with low fouling propensity.7,8 Sharing the same modularity potential as RO but with a capability
of desalinating water with a low-grade or waste heat source, FO is
thus attractive to niche point-of-use water applications where no/low-pressure
operation and infrequent membrane replacement are required. Furthermore,
FO can be readily integrated with other post-treatment stages such
as nanofiltration,9 ultrafiltration,10 membrane distillation,11,12 or low-pressure RO13 when need be.14 Especially, in such a hybrid system, if solar
energy can be effectively integrated with the FO module, total electricity
consumption for the whole process will be predominantly determined
by the post-treatment step.

With FO, however, one of the energy-intensive
steps is to regenerate
the osmotic agent (or draw solute), a critical factor that once improved
might help enhance the practicality and applicability for FO. Easy
separation/recycle must therefore be considered as an important criterion
for an ideal draw solute besides others such as high osmotic strength,
non-toxicity, and low cost. Besides conventional inorganic solutes,
several approaches for stable and regenerable draw agents with high
osmotic potential have been proposed in recent years,15 such as organic solutes (e.g., switchable polarity solvents16), surface-modified nanomaterials (e.g., magnetic
nanoparticles),17,18 hybrid organic–inorganic
multivalent salts (e.g., phosphazene19),
or polyelectrolytes.20,21 Although rendering draw agent
systems with remarkably high osmotic potential and regenerability,
these systems still encounter difficulties related to (1) (ir)reversible
agglomeration (for nanomaterials which require further costs to redisperse
them back into the solutions to maintain high osmotic strength upon
reusing), (2) solvent-induced membrane degradation (for switchable
polarity solvent systems which require high-cost solvent-resistant
membranes), (3) pumping energy intensiveness (for polyelectrolyte
systems because of their high viscosity), or (4) the need for energy-inefficient
phase-separating and trace-removal steps to recover draw solutes such
as CO2-assisted phase separation and/or reverse osmosis.22

To enable an energy-efficient separation
of draw solutes from water
for (1) collection of uncontaminated freshwater and (2) regeneration
of draw solutes, leveraging solar thermal energy and/or industrial
low-grade heat as the energy source is inevitable.23 Thermoresponsive materials are thus attractive for draw
solutes to help realize this target.12,24−27 Among those, ionic liquids (ILs) stand out as prominent candidates
as their ionic nature generally guarantees a high osmotic pressure.
Unlike commonly used inorganic salts in FO, the chemical structure
of both cations and anions of ILs can be readily fine-tuned to exhibit
desired thermodynamic properties.28,29 More specifically,
for the FO process, well-designed ILs undergo a lower critical solution
temperature (LCST) phase transition which significantly decreases
its miscibility with water upon heating.30−32 As this phase
transition of IL/water mixtures can occur at relatively low temperature
(∼50 °C), IL-derived draw solutes can function effectively
in a solar-powered FO desalination process and so does the cross-linked
versions of LCST ILs, that is, hydrogels, as they retain the LCST
phase behavior in this form.33−38

When thermoresponsive upper critical solution temperature
or LCST
ILs are used as draw solutes for FO, their regeneration typically
involve two phases: water-rich and IL-rich phase.29 The IL-rich phase can be recirculated back to FO to replenish
the draw solution, whereas the water-rich phase needs a further filtration
step, for example, nanofiltration, to produce fresh water. The water-rich
phase, although has a substantially lower solute concentration than
sea/brackish water, still contains ∼10 wt % of ILs according
to the lever rule of their U-shape LCST phase diagram (see the Results and Discussion section for details). To
recover water from IL-derived draw solutes with much less solutes,
hydrogels appear to be more beneficial as they are cross-linked ILs.
However, these hydrogels are often directly immobilized into FO membranes34,35,39 and thus markedly limit their
integration into a continuous FO process. To synergistically leverage
the advantages offered by ILs and hydrogels while overcoming each
of their drawbacks, we deterministically tailor a binary draw solute
system incorporating both thermoresponsive ILs and hydrogels and study
their behaviors in the FO process. The feasibility of using the hydrogel
to mitigate the water flux decline of the IL draw and recycling water
from the hydrogel is specifically demonstrated in this study. The
overarching goal is to render a draw solute system that can effectively
function in a continuous FO process, providing fresh water with minimal
solute contamination and requiring minimal electrical energy for regeneration.40,41

Results and Discussion
To have ILs with a LCST phase behavior,
a subtle balance between
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity is required for the ionic components.29,31 In this study, we focused on ILs with tetrabutyl phosphonium ([P4444]+) as the cation because of its balanced amphiphilicity
and capability to show LCST with a variety of anions. Three different
anions, including 4-methylbenzensulfonate ([MBS]−), 2,4-dimethylbenzensulfonate ([DMBS]−), and 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate
([VBS]−) anions (Figure 1), were assessed in terms of phase-transition
temperature and draw ability for FO. Note that P4444–VBS
was assessed not only as a draw solute but also as a monomer for hydrogels
by cross-linking the vinyl groups (Figure 1). The phase separation occurs immediately
(<5 s) after heating above its LCST, as shown for 10 wt % P4444–VBS at 50 °C (Figure 2a). To understand the dependence of IL concentration
on the phase separation temperature, IL/water mixtures with varying
concentrations were measured by temperature-dependent UV–vis
spectroscopy to generate the corresponding turbidity curves (Figure S1). The drop of transmittance at λ
= 600 nm was used to interpret the LCST for each IL/water mixture.
The dependence of concentration on the transmittance drop temperature
is summarized in an LCST phase diagram (Figure 2c). Among the three ILs, P4444–MBS exhibits the highest transition temperature across the
entire concentration range, whereas P4444–DMBS shows
a moderate LCST behavior with a transition temperature of 33 °C
at 50 wt % and P4444–VBS shows the lowest with LCST
of 28 °C at 50 wt %. The draw ability of ILs was initially assessed
by using 10 wt % ILs as draw solutions (DSs) against deionized water
(DI) as the feed solution (FS) (Figure 2b). Because P4444–DMBS possesses
the highest draw ability and a moderate LCST phase behavior, we focus
on evaluating the potential of P4444–DMBS as the
IL draw solute in the binary system.

route of the thermoresponsive
hydrogel.

Temperature-dependent turbidity curves of the hydrogel (λ =

The turbidity curve of the hydrogel was measured
with the swollen
hydrogel (twice of its original weight) (Figure 2d). Because the hydrogel mainly consists
of P4444–VBS, the LCST of the swollen hydrogel is
expected to be close to the LCST of 50 wt % P4444–VBS,
that is, 30 °C (Figure 2c). Counterintuitively, a LCST phase transition was detected
at 56 °C for the hydrogel (Figure 2d). We hypothesized that this interesting shift in
LCST was perhaps due to the addition of poly(ethylene oxide) as a
flexible cross-linker which then plasticized the IL structural network.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the freeze-dried water-contained
hydrogel clearly shows the sponge-like structure (Figure 2e), confirming its capability
of absorbing water.

The viscosity (Figure S3) and osmolality
of P4444–DMBS were further assessed as a function
of concentration. The osmotic concentration relative to the mass ratio
of IL and water (Figure 3a) does not generally follow mole stoichiometric trends.42 The IL behaves as a near-ideal solute43 at dilute conditions until a cluster-forming
domain begins, which results in a plateau of the osmotic pressure
as increase in concentration beyond that point is involved in cluster
formation. Beyond this cluster-forming regime, there is then a rise
in osmotic pressure as the bulk water between clusters is removed
at higher concentrations. A similar trend has been observed in other
solutes44 including LCST materials.45 Osmotic water flux was measured in the FO mode
(active layer faced the DS) to evaluate P4444–DMBS
as a draw solute against DI water and saline water FS (Figure 3b,c). Direct FO measurement
of 70 wt % P4444–DMBS against saline water FS with
varying salinities shows an intriguing insight into the draw ability
of P4444–DMBS. Specifically, the 70 wt % IL solution
is able to extract water from 0.15 to 0.3 M saline water (Figure 3c). Although the
water flux we observed for 70 wt % P4444–DMBS against
DI water is lower than that of using a common draw solute, such as
NaCl (Figure 3d), these
results have shown a similar and even higher flux compared to using
other ILs as the draw solute27 and possess
other advantages.

Figure 3 (a) Osmolality of P4444–DMBS solutions

Water flux profiles of (b) P4444–DMBS with varying
concentrations as DSs against DI water as the FS, (c) 70 wt % P4444–DMBS as the DS against saline water at various
concentrations as FSs, and (d) saline water with varying concentrations
as DSs against DI water. The FO measurements were conducted with Aquaporin-inside
membranes at 25 °C.

The synergistic effect created when both IL and hydrogel
were used
as draw solutes was evaluated with the setup shown in Figure 4a. Hydrogels packaged in a
tea bag were placed in the DS bottle. The micrometer size pore of
the tea bag allows an unhindered flow of the IL solution while preventing
hydrogels from flowing into tubes and clogging the FO cell. The DS
was stirred continuously throughout the whole FO process to ensure
a well-mixing and homogeneous solution, and the weight change of the
FS was recorded digitally and converted into water flux (see Material and Experiment section for details). The
contrast of using solely IL and an IL/hydrogel binary system as draw
solutes is clearly shown in Figure 4b. Because the initial flux (Jini) is dominated by the IL concentration, Jini obtained by the 40 g IL draw solute (Jini = 0.26 L·m–2·h–1) was higher than that of the 30 g IL/2 g hydrogel draw solute (Jini = 0.19 L·m–2·h–1). However, the flux performed by the former case
decreased significantly more rapidly than the latter case because
of the loss of osmotic pressure by continuous dilution. Furthermore,
the 30 g IL/2 g hydrogel performed even better than the 40 g IL in
the long run (>100 min). This enhanced durability of the binary
draw
system is contributed to the relatively constant IL concentration
in the DS. In a tandem fashion, hydrogels are able to simultaneously
extract water from the IL solution which then allows IL to draw water
from the FS at a relatively constant draw ability. Noticeably, because
the monomer of hydrogels is almost chemically identical to the IL,
using 30 g IL/2 g hydrogel in 70 g of DI water is equivalent to 31.4
wt % IL in terms of the amount of active materials, which is lower
than the case of using 40 g IL in 70 g of DI water (36.4 wt %). This
means that the binary draw solute system can not only reduce the cost
of draw solutes but also reinforce the draw performance in a long
run while maintaining a comparably low reverse solute flux, of 13.6
± 2.7 g/m2·h (or 0.031 ± 0.006 mol/m2·h) (Figure S4) as those performed
by typical IL-based draw solute systems reported in the literature.46,47 Note that these values were compared when cellulose acetate membranes
were used for FO tests.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic illustration of the FO setup.
(b) Long-term FO experiments
with various draw compositions against 0.15 M saline water feed, showing
that the synergistic effect of incorporating the hydrogel with ILs
retains the draw ability in the long run. The FO measurements of 30
g P4444–DMBS/2 g hydrogel and 40 g P4444–DMBS DSs were conducted with cellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes.
The reverse IL flux is 13.6 ± 2.7 g/m2·h (0.031
± 0.006 mol/m2·h) in our IL/hydrogel binary draw
system-of-interest.

As aforementioned, the
water in hydrogels can then be retrieved
by a thermal treatment. To evaluate this capability, after the FO
experiment, the water-saturated hydrogel exhibited a weight of 5.8
g, suggesting that a significant amount of water (1.9 times of the
initial hydrogel weight) was adsorbed by the hydrogel. The hydrogel
was further heated at 60 °C to recover the water from the hydrogel
system (Figure 5a).
In this process, the hydrogel sample was first loaded in a sealed
syringe and then heated in a water bath at 60 °C upon which an
amount of liquid emerged within a few minutes. To calculate the water
content emerging from this step of regenerating the hydrogel while
collecting fresh water, a calibration curve of P4444–DMBS/water
mixtures was first created. Briefly, samples with 1, 6, 10, and 20
wt % of P4444–DMBS were prepared and diluted by
89 times by adding desired amounts of DI water. Conductivity was measured
on the diluted samples, which exhibited a strong linear correlation
with R2 = 0.9986, as depicted in Figure 5b. Likewise, the
liquid sample from the hydrogel was diluted using the same ratio as
being used in the calibration (i.e., 89 times) and then measured with
a conductivity probe. The recycled liquid displayed a conductivity
of 93 μS/cm, which corresponds to an amount of only 6 wt % IL
(blue triangle in Figure 5b). A reasonably high purity of water could thus be recovered
from the process (of 94 wt % in this study). Because P4444–DMBS has been demonstrated to exhibit very low cytotoxicity
by using human fibroblast cell models,30 traces of ILs in the output stream do not necessarily need be treated
for some applications, for example, thermoelectric power plant cooling.
For the purpose of producing drinking water, the output stream can
be further treated by the nanofiltration process, and the LCST behavior
of P4444–DMBS provides an opportunity to utilize
thermal energy in the secondary process.

recovery from hydrogels. (b) IL/water conductivity
calibration curve and recycled water conductivity (all samples were
diluted by 89 times): y = 13.308x + 8.9607 (R2 = 0.9986).

To probe the effectiveness of using a hydrogel
to recover water
from the ion liquid versus directly heating the ion liquid, a 30 wt
% P4444–DMBS solution was also heated at 60 °C
to phase-separate water from the system using the same thermal treatment
for regenerating the swollen hydrogel. As expected, the homogenous
ion liquid/water mixture started to show two phases (water-rich phase
on top and IL-rich phase at bottom) when heating it up to a temperature
higher than the phase change temperature of 56 °C. The water-rich
phase from the top solution was again diluted by 89 times and showed
a conductivity of 165 μS/cm, suggesting a content of 12 wt %
IL (green triangle in Figure 5b). We estimated that the water content from heating the IL/water
mixture was only 88 wt %, relatively lower than the 94 wt % in the
case with the hydrogel. We believe that directly heating the hydrogel
affords another facile and effective approach to recover water from
the draw solution with a high water purity and efficiency without
the need of heating the entire draw solute, potentially providing
significant reduction of energy for water regeneration for the FO
process.

Conclusions
In this study, a proof-of-concept regarding
leveraging ILs both
in their natural and cross-linked (hydrogel) forms for use as a binary
draw solute system for FO is shown. Three thermoresponsive ILs and
a hydrogel with similar chemical identity have been assessed as the
draw solutes for FO, and the corresponding LCST phase behavior was
studied with UV–vis spectroscopy. With the considerations of
osmotic strength and phase transition temperatures, P4444–DMBS was used in a binary draw system with hydrogels. The
synergistic effect of using the IL/hydrogel binary draw solute system
has been demonstrated in terms of (1) creating a more durable DS with
less active materials, (2) the water recovered from the hydrogel contains
less solutes compared to direct phase separation of IL solutions,
and (3) the hydrogels are in a mobile phase which makes a continuous
FO process possible. In all, the proposed binary IL/hydrogel solute
system, in its infancy, shows encouraging results toward a future
of a sustainably and energy-efficiently solar-driven FO process where
just a small portion of the DS, that is hydrogel, needs to go through
a simple replenishing process to retrieve fresh water with decent
purity. Further improvement of FO performance in this approach is
expected by coupling hydrogels with other draw solutes with high osmotic
strength, for example, inorganic salts or organic salts.

Materials and
Experiments
Materials
Tetra-N-butylphosphonium
chloride (>80% in water), sodium 2,4-dimethylbenzenesulfonate monohydrate
(>98%), sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate (>93%), and sodium p-toluenesulfonate were purchased from VWR. Dichloromethane
(HPLC grade), poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (average Mn = 550 Da), and benzophenone (reagentplus,
99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used in
synthesis without further purification. DI water used in this study
was produced by the Milli-Q system (Advantage, A10).

Characterization
1H NMR spectra were recorded
in CDCl3 on a Bruker AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (500 MHz)
at room temperature. For the SEM characterization, a piece of the
swollen hydrogel (twice of its original weight) was freeze-dried by
the lyophilizer (LABCONCO, FreeZone 4.5 Plus) overnight and then coated
with a thin Au layer. The SEM image was recorded on a Zeiss Gemini
Ultra-55 Analytical Field Emission SEM system. The LCSTs of ILs and
the hydrogel were determined by monitoring the transmittance of light
(λ = 600 nm, ASD QualitySpec Pro UV–vis spectrometer).
A temperature-controlled water reservoir was coupled to the UV–vis
cuvette, and the temperature of the IL solution was directly recorded
by a thermocouple in situ (Figure S1a).
Viscosity was measured using an electromagnetically spinning viscometer
(EMS-1000, Kyoto Instruments). This technique measures viscosity based
on the rotation rate and magnetically applied force to a 2 mm aluminum
ball located in the testing solution. The viscometer was calibrated
using known standards (Cannon Instruments Inc.) and was within 3%
of the known values. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C throughout
the measurement, a rotation rate of 1000 rpm was used, and the reported
values represent the average of at least 10 individual viscosity measurements
on the same solution (Figure S3a). Additional
viscosity measurements were made using the falling bob method at 15
°C with a Cambridge Applied Systems VL4100 viscometer (Figure S3b). Inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) test, performed on Varian ICP-OES
720 Series, was used to quantify the total trace amount (ppm to ppb)
of ILs crossing over the membrane from the draw to the feed during
FO tests. After FO tests, samples of the feed was collected and diluted
by 100 times before ICP tests. Phosphorous 1000 ppm standard solution
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used to prepare diluted standard solutions having
phosphorus concentration ranging from 0.1 to 250 ppm. Osmotic pressures
of low concentration of IL aqueous solutions (i.e., 10 and 20 wt %)
were measured by freezing point depression osmometry using an Advanced
Instruments Inc. model 3250 Osmometer. Osmotic pressures of high concentration
of IL aqueous solutions were converted by the water activity (eqs 1 and 2) measured via non-contact resistive electrolytic sensor technology
on a Novasina LabMaster Standard Water Activity Instrument (range
−0.003 to 1.00aw, with an accuracy
of ±0.003aw) with Full Temperature
Control (0–50 °C, with an accuracy of ±0.3 °C). 1   2  

Synthesis of ILs and the Hydrogel
P4444–MBS
was prepared by dissolving tetra-N-butylphosphonium
chloride (10 g, 27 mmol) and sodium p-toluenesulfonate
(5.35 g, 27 mmol) in DI water (25 mL) and stirring overnight. The
dissolved mixture was extracted by dichloromethane (20 mL for three
times) and then washed by DI water (10 mL for three times). The solvent
was removed by rotary evaporation at 80 °C. 1H NMR
(500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.89–0.93 (t, 12H, CH3), 1.35–1.43 (m, 16H, CH2), 2.01–2.16
(m, 8H, CH2), 2.22 (s, 3H, CH3), 6.94–7.06
(d, 2H, CH), 7.56–7.68 (d, 2H, CH) ppm (Figure S2a).

P4444–DMBS was prepared
by dissolving tetra-N-butylphosphonium chloride (100
g, 270 mmol) and sodium 2,4-dimethylbenzene sulfonate monohydrate
(56.5 g, 270 mmol) in DI water (275 mL) and stirring overnight. The
dissolved mixture was extracted by dichloromethane (20 mL for three
times) and then washed by DI water (10 mL for three times). The solvent
was removed by rotary evaporation at 80 °C. 1H NMR
(500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.89–0.93 (t, 12H, CH3), 1.35–1.43 (m, 16H, CH2), 1.98–2.07
(m, 8H, CH2), 2.26 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.60 (s, 3H,
CH3), 6.96 (d, 1H, CH), 6.99 (s, 1H, CH), 7.78 (d, 1H,
CH) ppm (Figure S2b).

P4444–VBS was prepared by dissolving tetra-N-butylphosphonium
chloride (50 g, 135 mmol) and sodium
4-vinylbenzenesulfonate (30.9 g, 135 mmol) in DI water (175 mL) and
stirring overnight. The dissolved mixture was extracted by dichloromethane
(20 mL for three times) and then washed by DI water (10 mL for three
times). The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at 60 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.89–0.93
(t, 12H, CH3), 1.43–1.45 (m, 16H, CH2), 2.23–2.25 (m, 8H, CH2), 5.19–5.22 (d,
1H, CH), 5.69–5.73 (d, 1H, CH), 6.63–6.68 (q, 1H, CH),
7.26–7.34 (d, 2H, CH), 7.81–7.83 (d, 2H, CH) ppm (Figure S2c).

The hydrogel was prepared
by mixing P4444–VBS
(2 g), poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (50 mg), and benzophenone
(8.24 mg) under nitrogen followed by 2 h of UV-curing (356 nm, 2030
μW/cm2, Spectrolinker XL-1500 Series UV Crosslinker).

FO Measurement
Commercial flat sheet membranes were
used in this study, including Aquaporin-inside FO membranes (Sterlitech)
and CTA flat sheet membranes (HTI). The Aquaporin-inside membrane
was soaked in DI water for 1 h to replace the liquid in the package
before use, and the CTA membrane was stored in a 2% Na2SO3 solution and rinsed with DI water before use. A commercial
membrane cell (Sterlitech, CFO42A) was used for the FO measurements
to sandwich the flat-sheet membranes with a total membrane active
area of 42 cm2. In the FO measurement, the active layer
of FO membrane faced the draw solution (AL–DS configuration).
The general FO experimental procedure started with 100 g of FS and
100 g of DS in the glass media bottles. For the study of the synergistic
effect of the binary draw solute system, 30g and 40 g ILs (P4444–DMBS) were dissolved in 70 g of DI water, separately, and
an additional 2 g of hydrogel in a tea bag was placed in the 30 g
IL solution. In this way, the draw performance of 30 g IL + 2 g hydrogel
can be directly compared with 40 g IL. A gear pump (LongerPump, BT
100-1L) was used to continuously recirculate both DS and FS at a flow
rate of 120 mL·min–1. A stirrer was used in
the DS bottle to ensure good mixing of DS and water extracted from
FS. The mass variation of DS was monitored by a digital balance (Veritas)
with a uncertainty of ± 5 mg and converted to the permeate flux.
The first 15 min of each batch was used to stabilize the system, and
then, the flux was calculated from the proceeding time and mass loss
of the FS reservoir.

Water Regeneration from the IL/Water Mixture
In this
work, when the water permeation data was completed, the hydrogel was
removed from the IL mixture with the external surface quickly cleaned
with paper towels and was weighted to record the water trapped in
the hydrogel. Afterward, the hydrogel was placed in a syringe and
heated at a 60 °C water bath, and the water started to phase-separate
from the swollen hydrogel. The syringe was only used for draining
the phase-separated water phase and no pressure was applied on the
hydrogel. A freshly synthesized hydrogel (2 g) was studied, which
yielded a limited quantity of liquid samples of 3.3 g. For the conductivity
measurement (Oakton cond 6+), the liquid sample was diluted by 89
times by DI water. To estimate the water content in the sample from
regeneration, a calibration curve was created by preparing IL/water
mixtures with known IL content from 1 to 20 wt % and subsequently
diluted by 89 times using DI water to ensure consistency with the
calibration sample with recycled water. Conductivity was measured
on the diluted samples and plotted into a calibration curve.
