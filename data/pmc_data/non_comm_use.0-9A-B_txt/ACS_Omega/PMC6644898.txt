Optical
properties of noble metal nanostructures associated with
localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are technically important
for optical switches and plasmonic devices. In this work, silver nanoclusters
are embedded inside the soda-lime glass matrix, followed by a thermal
annealing process in an open air atmosphere for 1 h. The effects of
thermal annealing on the plasmonic behavior of Ag nanoclusters embedded
in the glass matrix are studied with UV–vis spectroscopy and
photoluminescence. In the SPR spectra, a 14 nm blue shift is observed
in the visible range under the influence of thermal annealing at a
higher temperature. The thermal effects on Ag particle size and SPR
have been illustrated for plasmonic properties. The structural and
elemental investigation of as-grown Ag nanoclusters is confirmed by
X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscope,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The structural, plasmonic, and
thermodynamic properties associated with the growth mechanism of Ag
nanoclusters have been explained under the thermal process. Enthalpy
(ΔH), entropy (ΔS),
and Gibbs energy (ΔG) for Ag nanoclusters growth
and nucleation are significantly calculated and interpreted at different
temperatures. An empirical relation among the ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG is developed
vis-a-vis activation energy (97.70 J/mol), which is calculated by
the Arrhenius linear equation.

1 Introduction
Over
the past few decades, plasmon-based noble metallic nanostructures,
such as Ag, Au, and Cu, under the category of transitional metals,
have drawn tremendous scientific attention and interest due to their
tunable plasmonic and catalytic behavior on the nanoscale. Such embedded
metallic nanostructures are significantly used in various applications,
such as optoelectronics,1−3 catalysis,4 detection,5 and biomedicine.6 In the field of plasmons, the noble metal nanoclusters,
which are dispersed in a transparent glass matrix, exhibit both linear
and nonlinear optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties.
These nanostructures are highly useful for surface-plasmon-based applications,
like surface-enhanced fluorescence,7 surface-enhanced
Raman scattering,8 and nanophotonic devices
and circuits.9 The interaction of electromagnetic
radiation with such a metal-nanocluster-embedded glass matrix exhibits
characteristic SPR in the visible region due to a coherent oscillation
of conduction band electrons.10 Thus, the
resonance frequency of metallic nanoclusters could be tuned by selecting
the composition, dielectric matrix, and interparticle distances of
narrow and shaped nanoparticles.11,12 Therefore,
among the plasmonic noble metals, Ag has attracted great attention
due to its localized sharp and distinct SPR in the visible light region.
In plasmonic materials, a transparent silicate glass embedded with
nanoscale Ag metal is one of the best choices due to its third-order
nonlinear susceptibility and ultrafast effect.13,14 Therefore, the soda-lime glass matrices have been used as advanced
host matrices for growing metal clusters on the nanoscale due to their
mechanical strength, higher transparency, and easy fabrication. The
arrays of metallic nanoclusters could be oriented under thermal or
irradiation environments for producing a fine size distribution of
nanosize particles inside the soda-lime glass matrix. Currently, various
methods have been reported for the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles embedded
in a glass matrix, such as ion implantation, melt-quench techniques,
low-energy ion-beam mixing, physical vapor deposition, laser ablation,
and ion exchange.15,16 The synthesis methods have been
reported with few demerits, but the ion-exchange method, which we
have chosen, needs less concentration with shorter time. Thereby,
we have preferred to anneal the sample from 500 to 650 °C, with
a higher precision and better size control, which is advantageous
over other methods used.

In the light of the above, Ag nanoclusters
embedded on a soda-lime
glass matrix have been fabricated using 0.5% of AgNO3 with
95.5% of NaNO3. The Ag+ ion exchange has been
made within a short duration at 390 °C as compared to the reported
work.15 The chosen ratio of AgNO3 and NaNO3 is found adequate to reduce Ag+ to
Ag0 in thermal conditions.15,16 The Ag particles
are structurally oriented as nanoclusters under uniform annealing
(up to 650 °C) for 1 h inside the dielectric matrix. Therefore,
the objective of our work has been to study the nanoclustering and
tunable plasmonic behavior of the Ag-doped soda-lime glass. The structural,
optical, and thermodynamic properties of as-grown Ag nanoclusters
have been investigated and explained with mutual relevance. Such relevance
is very useful to develop thermodynamic aspects for a thermally induced
process by considering enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy.17,18 Moreover, thermodynamic measurements revealed the fundamental information
about the physicochemistry of the growth mechanism, which has been
explained under thermal conditions.19−21 In contrast, the annealing
temperature and time are both important factors for growing the material
under controlled morphology with the surrounding environments. Thus,
in a thermal process, the chemical and physical interactions of components
regulate both the nucleation and the crystal growth with lattice orientations
allowing the mass and heat-transfer phenomenon.22,23

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows UV–vis
spectra of pristine (ion-exchanged) and annealed samples at various
temperatures for 1 h. The thermal interaction required to release
electrons from the soda glass matrix for Ag+ reduction
to Ag0, substantiated by higher thermal energy from 550
to 650 °C, seems to be accompanied with higher atomic or electronic
energy involvement causing a blue shift. However, simultaneously the
higher kinetic energy could have synergized the Ag dispersion vis-à-vis
glass materials to place Ag0 closely as a cluster of comparatively
larger sized. Along with this, the needful fundamental science is
incorporated in the article. It is seen that the pristine sample does
not show any absorption band due to the ionic form of Ag+ ↔ Na+ exchanged inside the glass matrix or below
1 nm Ag particle synthesis at 390 °C for 5 min.24 After annealing, the sharpened SPR intensity increases
from 500–650 °C due to the thermal growth of neutral Ag
particles inside the glass matrix (Figure 1a).

spectroscopy analysis.

The substrate was considered as a host material that provided
the
required electrons for reduction of Ag ions into neutral Ag atoms.
A temperature-driven mechanism was developed for the reduction process,
and the source of electrons are discussed in the mechanism. In the
process, initially Ag+ was introduced to replace Na+ inside the glass matrix. At higher temperatures, the electrons
are captured from the silicate species of glass that used to reduce
the Ag+ to Ag0. Moreover, the pure glass slide
was used as the blank during the UV–vis spectra measurements,
which nullified the substrate properties. Thus, an absorbance exists
owing to the reduced Ag particles in UV–vis spectra. It is
concluded that the higher population of reduced Ag atoms are formed
with the ascending temperature, which reduces broadening of the SPR
band at the visible region. As a result, a significant blue shift
of 14 nm was observed from 425 to 411 nm, in the range of 500–650
°C (Table 1).
It is already reported that the refractive index decreases at the
glass surface with increasing temperatures.25 As compared to pristine Ag, a higher Ag population occurs at 500–650
°C on transferring the higher kinetic energy, where the medium
itself becomes highly mobile rather than emitting rays, so the refractive
index decreases. The structurally oriented reduced Ag atom arrays
produce a lower refractive index from 500 to 650 °C. An effect
of thermal treatment for controlling the size of Ag nanoclusters inside
the glass matrix was investigated by the Mie theory calculation (Figure 1b–d). For
the small clusters <10 nm, the decrease in fwhm with increasing
cluster size is due to the mean free-path effect of electrons.26 For a higher blue shift from 500 to 650 °C,
the shorter λmax, a free mean path is generated.
However, the shorter mean free path indicates Ag+ →
Ag0 reduction at 500–650 °C due to oscillated
electronic encounters caused by enhanced surface Ag dispersion. The
plasmonic behavior of Ag nanoclusters, which are well dispersed in
the transparent glass matrix and depend on size-dependent permittivity
ε(ω, R) and absorption extinction (K) of Ag nanoparticles, where R > λ
and λ is the wavelength of light, is given by the following
equation under quasistatic or dipole–dipole approximation.25 1  The Mie theory resonance occurs when ε1(ω)
= −2εm. When the Mie theory
is fulfilled, the light field induces a resonant coherent oscillation
of free electrons across the metal nanoparticle.

The optical coefficient (α)
for metal (Ag) nanoparticles
surrounded by the dielectric medium is expressed as36,37 2  where εm is the dielectric
constant of the medium, V is the volume fraction
of metal particles, which is small compared to the imposed light wavelength
(λ), and ε1 and ε2 are frequency-dependent
real and imaginary components that could be expressed by the optical
constant of their bulk metal.38 The dielectric
function ε (ω, R) for metal nanoparticles
can be given as 3  Where
Γ and Γ(R) are relaxation time for the
bulk metal and size-limited time, respectively,
and ωp is the Drude plasma frequency in bulk metal.
The Drude plasma frequency depends on the electron density (n) of electron effective mass (me), N is free electrons per unit volume (Ag, ωp = 5.17 × 1015 s–1), νf = 1.39 × 106 m/s is the Fermi velocity for
bulk silver, and C is the volume concentration of
the embedded particles.

The resonance condition is satisfied
only for the Ag nanoparticles
in the visible wavelength range. This is basically the origin of their
intense color, as shown in Figure 1. The average size of Ag nanoclusters is calculated
with the equation given below. 4  where d is the average
size
of the particle, Vf is the Fermi velocity
of electrons of bulk Ag (1.39 × 106 m/s), and ΔE1/2 is the fwhm of SPR band. The data are in
close agreement for a size of Ag that is smaller than the free mean
path of electrons, which is 27 nm at room temperature (RT) (25 °C)
for the bulk Ag.26 The particle sizes calculated
by UV–vis absorption spectra based on the Gaussian profile
are 1.4, 2.8, 5.2, and 6.1 nm for 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C,
respectively (Figure 1b).

Figure 2 shows PL
spectra of the as-exchanged and thermally annealed Ag+–Na+ ion-exchanged glass samples at various temperatures for 1
h. The PL spectra were recorded at 325 nm excitation wavelength at
RT for all samples. The PL intensity decreases systematically on turning
toward higher annealed temperatures at 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C
respectively. The pristine sample shows higher intensity due to higher
Ag+ ionic population, which exists on the glass substrate
initially, but the intensity decreases systematically from 500 to
650 °C as the Ag+ ionic species converts into Ag0 atoms under the thermal growth process.27 Moreover, the opacity of Ag nanoclusters dispersed in soda-lime
glasses increased (very faint to dark yellow) with increasing annealing
temperatures (Figure 2a). It has earlier been studied that the no emission spectra were
recorded for the neutral Ag0 atom in any excitation wavelength,
whereas the Ag+ ions show luminescence behavior in both
the bulk crystal structure and the glass matrix.27 On increasing annealing temperatures, the decreased PL
intensity has confirmed a fast growth of Ag0 atoms on the
glass matrix, which might be the reason for reducing the PL intensity.
The luminescence properties of pristine and annealed samples under
325 nm have been identified using Commission Intemational de I’Eclairage
(CIE) chromaticity study (Figure 2b). The emission spectra of Ag-embedded samples were
converted to CIE chromaticity using PL data. The pristine samples
show a yellow region compared with annealed samples as the latter
shows a blue shift, which is also exhibited in UV–vis spectra.
The CIE diagram shows an optical change in the visible range due to
size variations at different temperatures. The shifting of color in
the CIE graph indicates a blue shift observed from 500 to 650 °C
(Figure 2b), which
is in close agreement with UV–vis blue shifts. This study helps
to observe the opacity change in Ag-embedded glass materials due to
change in absorbance and scattering of diffused and accumulated Ag
particles. This is the reason that we have used the CIE study with
PL data in our work. These optical results indicate that the as-embedded
Ag nanostructures show multicolor emissions over the visible zone
when they are induced by the single-wavelength light. These optical
properties could be used in several applications like optoelectronic,
bioimaging, and light emitting diodes.

and annealed samples with opacity order,

For the morphology, transmission election microscopy
has been performed
for an Ag-embedded glass-annealed sample at 650 °C, which was
mounted on a carbon-coated copper grid with 200 mesh. Figure 3 shows TEM images of spherical
Ag nanoclusters embedded in the glass matrix after thermal growth
(Figure 3a). The 5
nm average size is calculated from the TEM images at 650 °C (Figure 3d) and reported already,
which is in close agreement with the UV–vis size calculated
by the Mie theory (Figure 1b,d). Several researchers have also reported TEM images for
lower temperatures (2.9, 4.4 nm at 550 and 600 °C), which were
correlated with the 650 °C annealed sample in our study.47 Both the high-resolution transmission electron
microscope (HRTEM) image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern (Figure 3b,c)
were analyzed, which shows spherical Ag nanoparticles. The particles
show a crystalline nature as they are grown at higher temperatures
with (111) crystallographic planes that have 0.24 nm d-spacing for Ag0 nanoparticles.28,29 The UV–vis results show the intense peaks that might have
come out due to spheres of Ag0 particles that could be
of equal distribution. Thereby, we have applied the Mie theory for
size determination of metallic Ag particles and not the metal oxide
(Ag2O). The metallic crystalline nature was confirmed with
SAED patterns, and the shape is analyzed by TEM images that show spherical
Ag particles. The shape, size, and distribution are investigated under
the nanorange for Ag0 particles because the plasmonic properties
are tuned by the size and distribution pattern of the particles in
the glass substrate.

nanoparticles.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
were analyzed for the pristine
and annealed samples at 600 and 650 °C for 1 h. The XRD profile
of a pristine sample shows few extra peaks due to the glass compositions
and glassy behavior of the ion-exchanged sample at 390 °C (Figure 4). The annealed samples
show a very sharp and high intense peak due to the rapid thermal growth
of Ag nanoclusters with (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystallographic
planes and the FCC crystalline structure with respect to 38.2, 44.3,
64.6, and 77.2° values (JCPDS file no. 00-004-0783) (Figure 4).30 Thus, the thermal effects play a significant role for both
the nucleation and growth of Ag nanoclusters inside the glass matrix.
At 390 °C, that is, before annealing a sample, the extra peaks
have appeared in XRD spectra of the pristine sample, which may be
due to the presence of Ag2O at 32.7° on the 2θ
scale (ICCD Card No: 00-41-1104) along with glassy contents, such
as Fe2O3, at around 57, 54° (511, 422),
Al2O3 46° (400) (JCPDS 10-0425) and MgO
at 42° (200) (JCPDS- 01-1235).31−33 Remarkably, on completely
annealing from 600 and 650 °C, the glass matrix did not show
these peaks in XRD spectra, which could be due to a higher distribution
of Ag neutral atoms diffused on the glass surface at 600 and 650 °C.
However, the annealed sample at 600 °C showed a comparably less
intense peak than that at 650 °C, which indicates the higher
diffusion and accumulation of Ag nanoclusters on the glass surface
at the applied temperature (Figure 4). Thus, the particle sizes are controlled under thermal
effects and the crystalline sizes of Ag nanoclusters were calculated
using the Scherrer equation with respect to different temperatures.
The obtained sizes are 8.9 and 8.3 nm for the 650 and 600 °C
annealed samples using the Debye–Scherrer formula (Figure S4). Thus, on increasing the annealed
temperature, the sizes are increased because of the larger clustering
of reduced Ag particles. The obtained sizes are 8.9 and 8.3 nm for
the 650 and 600 °C annealed samples in XRD results, respectively,
using the Debye–Scherrer formula (Figure S4). Thus, on increasing the annealed temperature, the sizes
are increased because of the larger clustering of the reduced Ag particles.
These results are close to the UV–vis sizes (5.2 and 6.2 nm)
for 600 and 650 °C, whereas the TEM images show a 5 nm average
size, which is in agreement with XRD and UV–vis sizes. At higher
temperatures, the XRD peaks (38.2, 44.3, 64.6, and 77.2°) support
the presence of Ag particles and not Ag2O, which infer
a pure Ag nanocluster formation. These results are correlated with
the spectra of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the eV
for the splitting of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of the Ag0 atom are present at 650 °C.
These splitting energies are closely matched with the XPS of the literature
values reported for the Ag atom.34,35 Consequentially,
the pristine sample shows comparably broad and less intense peaks,
with some additional peaks due to the presence of glassy compositions
with less Ag particles. However, the annealed samples show highly
intense and sharp peaks due to larger Ag0 population on
the glass surface. The oxidation state of Ag particles is confirmed
by XRD and XPS, where the neutral Ag particles were found at higher
temperature. In the pristine sample, Ag2O could be present
because an ion-exchange process was conducted in open air at 390 °C.
However, at 650 °C, due to higher kinetic energy, the oxygen
could have escaped out of the chemical process of ion exchange. Thus,
the Ag2O peak is not seen in XRD spectra.

samples at 600 and 650 °C. The XRD profile of pristine and annealed
samples.

The XPS spectra were recorded
for the investigation of in situ
diffusion of Ag atoms toward the glassy surface under thermal treatment.
In XPS measurement, the core-level photoelectron binding energy was
initially calibrated by the surface carbon C 1s at 284.6 eV. Figure 5 shows Ag 3d XPS
spectra of the Ag annealed sample at 650 °C for 1 h. The thermal
growth of Ag nanoclusters identify with XPS spectra of core-level
Ag 3d signals, which reveal the thermal diffusion of Ag atoms on the
surface at higher temperatures. Binding energy of the annealed sample
is located at 368.0 and 374.1 eV, corresponding to spin–orbit
splitting of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively (Figure 5b). The located peak of Ag 3d at the core-level spectrum
confirmed the presence of neutral silver in metallic form in the glass
host and showed 6.0 eV differences34,35 between the
two major Ag peaks. The results confirmed that Ag+ ionic
atoms are reduced as Ag neutral atoms and diffuse toward the glass
surface as nanoclusters under thermal treatment. The expected elements
like C and O are present due to the atmospheric environment, where
the O atom occurred may be due to the SiO2 content of the
glass matrix. For the annealed sample at 650 °C, the Ag 3d peaks
were observed at 368.0 and 374.1 eV corresponding to the spin–orbit
splitting of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 (Figure 5b), respectively, whereas the pristine sample did not show the Ag
3d peak because there is no reduced Ag atom on the glass surface at
390 °C. The AgO XPS peaks are reported at 368.2 eV, which is
not found in the 650 °C annealed sample because of a complete
reduction of Ag+ to Ag0. So it is considered
that the reduced Ag atoms are diffused toward the surface at higher
temperatures rather than the Ag oxide species. Ag0 is not
observed in the full scan because the C and O peaks are prominent
as compared to Ag atom, but by selecting the binding energy of core
Ag 3d determined with XPS, the peak is observed at 650 °C due
to spin-splitting in the orbit of Ag 3d5/2 and
Ag 3d3/2. So in XPS full survey scan spectra,
the carbon C 1s peak appeared due to a natural contaminant reaching
the vacuum chamber of the XPS instrument (Figure 5). The O 1s peak appeared at 531.1 eV, which
may be assigned to SiO2 of the glass matrix (Figure 5d).

3 Thermal Growth Mechanism
for Ag Nanoclusters
inside the Glass Matrix
During the ion-exchange process,
the Ag+ ions are incorporated
into the host matrix by substituting Na+ at 390 °C
to form Ag0 in a small amount. Under the thermal conditions
(up to 650 °C), the Ag ions reduced to neutral Ag atoms by capturing
the required electrons from the glass matrix,39 especially from the silicate species (Figure 6). The population of Ag nanoparticles depends
upon a fractional volume of Ag+ ions, which requires sufficient
electrons from the host material. The proposed mechanism infers that
the required electrons are captured from the glass-containing atoms,
especially the intrinsic oxygen.40 The
thermal reduction of Ag ions into Ag neutral is explained in the growth
mechanism, where the available electrons have reduced the Ag metal
represented as: 

Figure 6 Schematic representation for thermal growth of Ag nanoclusters
within soda-lime glass. The thermal growth mechanism for Ag nanoclusters
within the glass matrix.

The Ag+ ions are reduced into Ag nanoclusters
on capturing
the electrons as per requirements, leading to higher population of
Ag nanoclusters under the annealing conditions. The Ag atoms with
higher kinetic energy diffuse on the glass surface at higher temperatures
because of the thermal relaxation of surface tensile stress. Ag0 accumulation with the relaxation produces the Ag nanoclusters
on the glassy surface after cooling the annealed samples at RT for
5–6 h. Such spatial Ag nanocluster arrangements vis-à-vis
thermal reduction induce thermodynamic changes. Thus, we have reported
enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs energy (ΔG), as the metallic
nanomaterials were prepared under thermal process (Table 2). We have also observed the
initiation, ionization, reduction, dissociation, and oxidation processes
systematically under a thermally driven mechanism for Ag nanoclusters’
growth. Thus, our work explored new information for developing advanced
metallic embedded nanomaterials by dispersing noble metals in the
dielectric medium on thermal treatments.

4 Thermodynamics
for Thermally Structured Ag Nanoclusters
inside the Glass Matrix
As the Ag nanoclusters are grown
and reoriented under the temperature-driven
mechanism, the thermodynamic properties are studied. Such studies
are relevant for basic understanding of Ag+ to Ag0 reduction, with thermally realigned Ag nanoclusters within the matrix.
Ag+ ions require sufficient energy to overcome the static
barrier potential at a low temperature, which could be considered
as the bonding energy of Ag–O in the matrix. This required
energy is noted as activation energy (Ea), which plays a key role for the thermal growth of Ag clusters.
Thus, we have studied the activation energy with the enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs energy
(ΔG) values for pristine and annealed processes
(Table 2). Moreover,
Ag+ to Ag0 were thermally dispersed in the glass
matrix and precipitated as Ag nanoclusters at various temperatures.
Thus, both the diffusion and accumulation of the Ag atoms increase
at higher temperatures, which could have caused a change in optical
properties by light scattering and absorbance of diffused Ag atoms41 and are adequately focused on in this study.

In the UV–vis absorbance measurement, pure soda-lime glass
slide is used as the blank sample which nullified the glass (substrate)
properties for the optical density. Thus, the optical absorbance exists
through the Ag particles that are embedded or diffused on the glass
surface. So it is clearly justified that the optical density is considered
due to the reduced Ag atoms. Consequently, we have used optical absorbance
as the authentic data for calculation of activation energy and other
thermodynamic parameters for Ag nanocluster growth. So UV–vis
absorbances are used to detect the changes in the form of optical
density, as experimentally observable signals. The optical density
or absorbance is used as authentic data to calculate the activation
energy along with other thermodynamic properties (Figure 7). The activation energy is
calculated using the Arrhenius equation (Figure S3) on increasing the temperature and fitted as 5  where abs is the absorbance, T is
the temperature (kelvin), R is the gas constant
(8.314 J/(mol K)), A is the frequency factor, and Ea is the activation energy (J/mol). Log(abs)
versus 1/T plot of the Arrhenius equation is a straight
line with (−Ea/R) slope, depicting Ag0 diffusion on the glass matrix as
the first order process (Figure 7). The reduction from Ag+ to Ag0 and diffusion of Ag0 toward the surface depends on the
activation energy, which is the essentially required energy for breaking
Ag–O bonds during the annealing process. Because Ag0 is featured by optical absorbance, the absorption is noted as an
authentic experimental variable for calculating Ea. Further, this Ea is used
to calculate the ΔH for the pristine and annealed
processes given under 6  The temperature
effect on pristine and annealed
samples have been investigated; the absorbance versus temperature
relation furnishes information about the kinetic rate for Ag0 nanoclustering and derives thermodynamic parameters of the growth
mechanism. So the Gibbs energy (ΔG) and entropy
(ΔS) for Ag clustering are calculated using
equations (Figure S3) given as 7  Equation 7 is modified as under  Because
the UV–vis absorbance inferred
the transformation from Ag+ → Ag0, it
is used as a variable in the equation for calculating the Gibbs energy
(ΔG) 8  where, the
symbols are usual for Ag nanoclustering
under the applied thermal treatment, respectively, at both adequate
activation energy and Gibbs energy. The chosen thermodynamic parameters
have supported the thermal nanoclustering of Ag in the glass matrix.

Figure 7 Activation

Activation energy calculation.

The above mechanism has inferred an enthalpy change which
could
illustrate an internal arrangement of Ag nanoclusters. The positive
ΔH from 5.62 to 7.77 kJ/mol depicts growth
and nucleation processes for pristine and annealed samples (Table 2). From 390 to 650
°C, for the annealing process, ΔH becomes
more endothermic on decreasing ΔG from 923.15
and 873.15 K, which indicates a spontaneous process (Table 2). Further, increasing positive
ΔH values and similarly decreasing ΔG values directly reflect a coercive thermodynamic energy
exchange from 390 to 650 °C (Figure 8). Such a valuable thermodynamic relationship
creates a vacancy and elucidates the need of kinetic energy for transforming
Ag+ to Ag0 owing Ag–O bond breaking and
arranging the Ag atoms in an FCC phase with higher crystallinity.
This kinetic energy enhances the nucleation of a larger population
of Ag atoms42,43 into the FCC crystal lattice.
Thereby, on forming the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystallite
planes, polycrystallinity of the Ag nanocluster samples are depicted
from XRD analysis (Figure 4). Table 2 reports
the entropy of the process from 390 to 650 °C, where the high
annealing temperature is associated with positive entropy as compared
to the negative entropy at lower temperature. These results support
the findings obtained from the XRD analysis, where the FCC (111),
(200), (220), and (311) planes of Ag are absent in the pristine sample
(at T = 663.15 K), whereas the crystallographic planes
are present in annealed samples at higher temperatures (Figure 4). The presence of lattice
planes of Ag nanoclusters, which is diffused in the glass, reflects
a less ordered arrangement with positive entropy. The higher temperature
facilitates the presence of variable crystalline plane orientations
with a randomized direction of atomic arrangements.

Figure 8 Kinetic model for enthalpy,
entropy, and Gibbs free energy for
pristine and annealed samples. ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG relations for thermal growth
of Ag nanoclusters.

The positive ΔS values for annealing depict
favorable entropic changes with increased Ag0 population.
Both the ΔH and ΔS values
show an optimized energy, with a mutual relationship of the enthalpy–entropy
compensation phenomenon. Such trends depict causing either the higher
ΔH absorption or release, and in both cases,
the ΔS increases and decreases accordingly.
Thus, their mutual relationship depicts a partitioning of Ag0 in the glass matrix in spatial orientations. A significant mutual
relation among ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS reveals the thermal growth and clustering
behavior of Ag atoms in the process (Figure 8). On increasing ΔH, ΔS is increased due to the required thermal
energy transformation during the bond breaking and making process
for the Ag–O and Ag–Ag inside the glass matrix. Thus,
the enthalpy is increased for reduction and clustering of the reduced
Ag atoms through the redox and Ag clusters reorientation phenomenon.
However, ΔS is increased due to a stronger
nanoclustering of reduced Ag atoms at higher temperature, which forms
Ag–Ag bonds. These two thermodynamic parameters collectively
infer the thermal growth and clustering behavior, which utilizes almost
all energy in the process of balancing the minimum energy of the system.
It is well documented that the spontaneity of any chemical reaction
could be represented by ΔG values.44 So in our work, we have explained the dependence
of ΔG in favor of Ag clustering within the
dielectric matrix. Also, at a very high temperature as well as higher
kinetic energy, the Ag atoms tend to self-accumulate as nanoclusters.
The thermodynamic synergy among ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS data are not independent
to each other but are interdependent. In our studies, the Ag-embedded
glass materials were subjected from 500 to 650 °C, where Ag+ converts to Ag0. The ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG properties
along with Ea are calculated using optical
absorbance at different temperatures. The trend and magnitude of the
ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG model is developed for nucleation and growth of Ag0 under the thermal process.

5 Conclusions
The Ag nanoclusters were grown and nucleated in a glass matrix
by an ion-exchange process, followed by thermal annealing from 500
to 650 °C. The Ag ions are reduced into neutral silver atoms
(Ag0), and subsequently Ag0 atoms are diffused
toward the surface under thermal treatments. The SPR behavior with
different sizes are calculated and explained by the Mie theory using
UV–vis measurements at various temperatures. Lower photoluminescence
intensity on increasing temperatures is attributed to the reduction
of Ag+ to Ag0 atoms on the glass matrix. The
XRD results have confirmed the FCC crystalline structure of Ag metal
after annealing the samples at 600 and 650 °C for 1 h. HRTEM
images have revealed the presence of spherical Ag nanoparticles (d111 = 0.23 nm), with a maximum particle size
of 5 nm at 650 °C, which is consistent with the Mie theory sizes.
The oxidation state of Ag0 has been confirmed by XPS spectra
located at Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 spin–orbit splitting for Ag nanoclusters at 650
°C. Thermodynamic studies are made for a thermal process with
97.70 kJ/mol of activation energy. The entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs
energy are arrived at from optical absorbance considered as experimental
authentic results, which help to understand the thermal mechanism
for reduction and nucleation of Ag nanoclusters.

6 Experimental
Section
6.1 Materials
Chemical reagents, such
as AgNO3 (99.0%) and NaNO3 (99.0%), were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich. Commercial (Blue Star Company, India) soda-lime
glass with weight-percent-wise composition of 72.0% SiO2, 14.0% Na2O, 0.6% K2O, 7.1% CaO, 4.0% MgO,
1.9% Al2O3, 0.1% Fe2O3, and 0.3% SO3), with 1 mm thickness, was used as the
host matrix. AR grade solvents were used for cleaning of the samples
in the whole experiment.

6.2 Synthesis of Ag Nanoclusters
The
ion-exchange (Ag+ ↔ Na+) route was performed
for Ag nanoclusters synthesis in a soda-lime glass. The Ag-embedded
glass material was prepared by an ion-exchange method, followed by
a thermal annealing at air atmosphere. Soda-lime glass was chosen
as the dielectric host matrix for Ag nanoclusters growth. First, the
glass slides were poured in formic acid for 15 min to remove the impurities
from the slide surface. Later, the poured glass slides were cleaned
with distilled water, acetone, and trichloroethylene by ultrasonication
(20 kHz) for 15 min. Now, the homogeneous mixture of 0.5% AgNO3 and 95.5% NaNO3 was prepared by molten piston
grinding. The glass slide pieces were kept in an alumina boat (Al2O3 > 99%) and filled with a grinded homogeneous
mixture of AgNO3 and NaNO3 precursors. The alumina
boat was transferred into a tubular furnace for Ag and Na ion-exchange
inside the glass slide at 390 °C for 5 min (Figure SI1). During this short duration, the Ag+ ions diffuse inside the glass by replacing the Na+ ions;
the details are given in Figure 6. After ionic in situ diffusion the as-ion-exchanged
samples were cooled at room temperature and then cleaned with distilled
water and acetone for removing the rest of the adhering part of AgNO3 on the glass surface. The as-ion-exchanged (pristine) samples
were faint yellow or colorless, and such optical behavior is observed
due to in situ diffusion of ionic species (Ag+/Na+) with different sizes, mechanical stress, and change in electrical
polarization of diffused ions in glass. Further, the cleaned pristine
samples were annealed from 500 to 650 °C for 1 h so that the
glass melting point is maintained to prevent glass. At lower temperatures,
few Ag+ ions are formed by Ag–O bond breaking in
the matrix but for diffusion on the surface, the higher energy is
required to move the ions toward a more relaxed surface. Thus, on
increasing temperature, the larger Ag segregation and diffusion was
done on the glassy surface and it could be understood by the size
difference in Ag+ and Na+ (ionic radius ratio, rAg+/rNa+ is 1.29).45,46 Our work is compared
and discussed with respect to annealing studies of Ag particles collected
from AgNO3 as precursor. These studies were conducted at
600 °C as reported elsewhere, and we have used a less concentration
as compared to that in the reported work,47 where the samples were annealed up to 650 °C. The effect of
temperature on size and plasmonic properties were investigated up
to 650 °C, which is advanced than that in the reported work.
Noticeably, we have investigated the thermodynamic properties accompanied
with a thermal growth of Ag nanoclusters at different temperatures,
which is not reported by other researchers who had followed the ion-exchange
route. Contrary to others, we have determined entropy, enthalpy, and
Gibbs properties, which are the most intricate probes and critically
undergo a change in their magnitudes vis-à-vis structural states
of the Ag nanoclusters. Thereby, our thermodynamic model could be
proven to be a pioneering one.

It is of key importance to find
thermodynamic properties because of the thermal process followed for
Ag diffusion and their clustering. Thus, the activation energy is
estimated with Gibbs energy, which helps to produce the Ag atoms due
to energy difference of pure Ag and Ag–O inside the glassy
matrix. The Gibbs free energy of Ag–O is lower than that of
the pure Ag, and this difference could have caused a dissociation
of Ag–O bonds to form Ag–Ag bonds that favor the minimum
energy state.48 Thus, it is clear that
the thermodynamic behavior of Ag diffusion by energy loss and thermal
relaxation of surface stress are caused by the radius difference between
Ag+ and Na+ (rAg+/rNa+ is 1.29).
The thermal growth mechanism for Ag nanoclusters inside the glass
matrix is schematically investigated, and its chemical reaction is
explained in Figure 6. The annealed samples were taken for their structural and optical
behavior in thermodynamic studies. The pristine and thermal annealed
samples were characterized by UV–vis, PL, XRD, XPS, and HRTEM
techniques for the optical, structural, and elemental confirmation.

The growth process of Ag nanoclusters embedded in glass were optimized
by thermal annealing using a tubular furnace from 500 to 650 °C.
The plasmonic properties were studied by dual beam UV–vis spectroscopy
(spectro 2060 plus) from 300 to 800 nm wavelength, and the pure soda-lime
glass was taken as a reference sample for UV–vis measurements.
The PL measurements were carried out by the Fluoromax Photoluminescence
spectrometer at 325 nm excitation wavelength for all samples. The
shape and size of Ag nanoclusters were studied with HRTEM (JEOL TEM
2100) operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The Ag-embedded glass
sample was crushed via pestle and mortar to form fine powder, and
then a few milligrams of the powder was dispersed in ethanol under
ultrasonication for 30 min. The few drops of the upper suspension
were placed on carbon copper-coated grid with 200 mesh for analysis.
The crystal structures of pristine Ag and Ag nanoclusters diffused
on a glass substrate were confirmed by XRD analysis (Bruker D8 diffractometer
using Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.54060 Å). XPS measurements
were performed using Omicron Nanotechnology ESCA plus (electron spectroscopy
for chemical analysis) with UHV twin anode Al Kα radiation of
1486.6 eV, generated by a 15 kV electron effect on the Al anode. The
pass energy (20 eV) was applied for 0.5 eV resolutions during photoelectron
scanning.
