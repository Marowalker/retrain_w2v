Colon cancer has emerged as one of the most devastating diseases in the
whole world. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-phosphatidylinsitol-3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling hub has gained lots of attention due to its deregulation
in colon cancer cells. However, selective targeting of oncogenic MAPK-PI3K
hub in colon cancer has remained highly challenging, hence it has
mostly been unexplored. To address this, we have engineered a hyaluronic
acid layered lipid-based chimeric nanoparticle (HA-CNP) consisting
of AZD6244 (MAPK inhibitor), PI103 (PI3K inhibitor), and cisplatin
(DNA impairing drug) ratiometrically in a single particle. Electron
microscopy (field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic
force microscopy) and dynamic light scattering were utilized to characterize
the size, shape, morphology, and surface charge of the HA-CNPs. Fluorescent
confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry analysis confirmed
that HA-CNPs were taken up by HCT-116 colon cancer cells by merging
of clathrin and CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis along with macropinocytosis
to home into acidic organelles (lysosomes) within 1 h. A gel electrophoresis
study evidently established that HA-CNPs simultaneously inhibited
MAPK-PI3K signaling hub with DNA damage in HCT-116 cells. These HA-CNPs
stalled the cell cycle into G0/G1 phase, leading to induction of apoptosis
(early and late) in colon cancer cells. Finally, these HA-CNPs exerted
remarkable cytotoxicity in HCT-116 colon cancer cells at 24 h compared
to that of the free triple drug cocktail as well as HA-coated dual
drug-loaded nanoparticles without showing any cell death in healthy
L929 fibroblast cells. These HA-coated CNPs have potential to be translated
into clinics as a novel platform to perturb various oncogenic signaling
hubs concomitantly toward next-generation targeted colon cancer therapy.

1 Introduction
Colon
cancer has materialized as the third foremost malignancy
in the whole world with 1.4 million new cases and 700 000 casualties
per year.1,2 Several chemotherapeutic small molecule
drugs (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, capecitabin, and irinotecan) have
already been approved by the FDA and are extensively used in clinics
for the treatment of colon cancer patients.3−5 However, these
traditional chemotherapeutic drugs extinguish noncancerous healthy
cells along with rapidly growing cancer cells as collateral damage
leading to severe off-target toxic side effects to the patients. However,
in the last couple of decades, the advent of molecularly targeted
therapy shifted the paradigm to reduce off-target toxicity.6−10 In this context, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), downstream mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) (involving RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade), and phosphatidylinsitol-3-kinase
(PI3K) (involving PI3K-Akt-mTOR cascade) signaling hubs remain highly
dysfunctional in different types of cancer including colon cancer.11−13 As a result, components of MAPK and PI3K pathways served as potential
targets for novel anticancer drug development.14−17 However, due to tumor heterogeneity,
the emergence of drug resistance (intrinsic and extrinsic), and complex
inter-/intracascade crosstalk, single pathway targeting strategies
remained suboptimal and less effective.18−21 Subsequently, synchronized targeting
of MAPK and PI3K signaling by polypharmacy evolved as an interesting
strategy.22−27 Nevertheless, small molecule MAPK and PI3K inhibitors showed dose-limiting
cardio- and immunotoxicity, developmental lethality, and hyperglycemia.28−30 Nanoscale toolkits have the promise to address these challenges.

In the last couple of decades, nanomedicine has changed the course
of cancer treatment by packing multiple therapeutic entities (small
molecule drugs, siRNA, microRNA, antibodies, and proteins) of different
physicochemical properties in a single nano-platform.31−35 Nanocarriers have unique properties that enable them to be accumulated
into malignant tissues by dysfunctional blood vessels (passive targeting).36−38 However, much improved accumulation of therapeutics into cancerous
tissues in a more specific manner can be achieved by surface decoration
of nanoplatforms with targeting moieties that can recognize specific
marker overexpressed on tumor tissues (active targeting).39,40 Several small molecules (biotin, folic acid), nucleic acids (aptamers),
proteins (antibodies), and biopolymers (carbohydrates) have been used
to surface wrap the nanoplatforms for improved therapeutic efficacy
of nanomedicine.41−45 In this context, recently, bio-polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA)
has been widely explored to coat different nanoplatforms to actively
target overexpressed CD44 receptors in different types of cancer cells,
especially colon cancer cells.46−48 Despite having immense improvements
in developing numerous nanocarriers for drug delivery into cancer
tissues, targeting of the therapeutically relevant oncogenic signaling
hub (MAPK-PI3K) selectively in colon cancer cells remains in its infancy
for next-generation cancer treatment.49−52

Encouraged by this less
explored space, in this article, we have
engineered hyaluronic acid-coated chimeric nanoparticles (HA-CNPs)
(inspired by a Greek mythological creature called “Chimera” having lion, goat, and serpent in the same
body) comprising AZD6244 (MAPK inhibitor), PI103 (PI3K inhibitor),
and cisplatin (DNA-damaging FDA-approved drug) in a ratiometric manner.
These HA-CNPs were hypothesized to be internalized more efficiently
through CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis into colon cancer cells
to target MAPK-PI3K signaling hub along with cellular DNA for improved
efficacy (Scheme 1c).
These HA-CNPs were found to be internalized into the colon cancer
cells (HCT-116) through a combination of CD44 receptor and clathrin-mediated
endocytosis mechanisms followed by localization into acidic lysosomal
compartments within 1 h. Simultaneous inhibition of MAPK and PI3K
signaling was achieved along with DNA damage by these HA-CNPs in HCT-116
cells leading to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, followed by
induction of apoptosis (early and late stage). Finally, these HA-CNPs
demonstrated remarkably improved cell killing ability compared to
that of the free drug combinations in HCT-116 colon cells, without
showing toxicity to the healthy fibroblast cells. This hyaluronic
acid-coated chimeric nanoparticle-mediated inhibition of MAPK-PI3K
signaling hub has the potential to usher in a novel therapeutic strategy
toward colon cancer patients in the future.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Engineering Hyaluronic
Acid-Coated Chimeric
Nanoparticles
To target MAPK-PI3K signaling hub, we have
chosen AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor) and PI103 (dual Akt-mTOR inhibitor)
as both of them are currently under clinical trials.53−56 Moreover, inhibition of MAPK-PI3K signaling hub along with downstream
nuclear DNA damage augmented therapeutic efficacy in cancer therapy.57−60 Therefore, we have chosen cisplatin (FDA-approved anticancer drug)
as the DNA-damaging agent in combination with AZD6244 and PI103. Biocompatible
and biodegradable cholesterol was used as the vector for developing
the chimeric nanoparticles. Furthermore, our group recently developed
cholesterol-based nanoparticles for targeting PI3K signaling to overcome
drug resistance in breast cancer cells.49 Hyaluronic acid, a negatively charged polysaccharide, was applied
to surface decorate the chimeric nanoparticles to target overexpressed
CD44 receptors on colon cancer cells.61,62

Cholesterol
(1) was first reacted with succinic anhydride to append a linker to
afford the cholesterol−succinic acid conjugate (2) in 77% yield,49 followed by conjugation with AZD6244 through
an ester linkage in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDCI)/4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to achieve the cholesterol–AZD6244
conjugate (3) in 78% yield (Scheme 1a). The cholesterol–AZD6244 conjugate was characterized
by 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopy
and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
(Figures S1–S4). We further conjugated
PI103 and cisplatin (CDDP) with cholesterol through ester and Pt–O–carboxylato
linkages to acquire cholesterol–PI103 (4) and cholesterol–CDDP
(5) conjugates.49 To impart positive charge
on the chimeric nanoparticles for further coating with negatively
charged HA, we synthesized the cholesterol–ethylenediamine
conjugate (6) from cholesteryl chloroformate.63

Chimeric nanoparticles (CNPs) were engineered by blending
conjugates
3, 4, 5, and 6 with phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polythylene
glycol)] (DSPE-PEG) in a ratiometric manner (Scheme 1b).49 Size and
surface charge of non-HA-coated bare CNPs were determined by dynamic
light scattering (DLS). The mean hydrodynamic diameter and ζ
potential were found to be 143.4 nm (polydispersity index (PDI) =
0.078) and +36.4 mV, respectively (Figure S5). These triple drug-loaded CNPs were further surface layered by
incubation with hyaluronic acid to obtain HA-CNPs (Scheme 1b).50 Mean hydrodynamic diameter of the HA-CNPs was found to be increased
to 176.5 nm (PDI = 0.139) (Figure 1a). On the other hand, the surface charge of the HA-CNPs
was also found to be −13.9 mV (Figure 1b). This increment in hydrodynamic diameter
and reversal of surface charge from positive to negative clearly confirmed
that the surface of the CNPs was successfully covered by hyaluronic
acid. The shape and morphology of the HA-CNPs were further visualized
by electron microscopy. The field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure 1c,d) evidently revealed that
HA-CNPs had a spherical shape and sub-200 nm size for potential accumulation
into tumor tissues by passive targeting through dysfunctional vascularization.36 To confirm the presence of AZD6244 and cisplatin
in the same particle, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was
performed. The elemental analysis from EDX spectra (Figure S6) confirmed the presence of Br and Pt atoms as components
of AZD6244 and cisplatin. This EDX assay exhibited that HA-CNP contained
inhibitors and DNA damaging drug in the same nanoparticle.

(c) FESEM, and (d) AFM.

Triple drug loading into HA-CNPs was subsequently evaluated
by
UV–vis spectroscopy through concentration versus absorbance
calibration curves at characteristic λmax = 273,
296, and 706 nm for AZD6244, PI103, and cisplatin, respectively (Figure S7a–c). The mean loading of AZD6244,
PI103, and cisplatin in the HA-CNPs was found to be 313.4 ± 4.5
μM (loading efficiency = 29.0%), 286.9 ± 7.5 μM (loading
efficiency = 23.5%), and 201.9 ± 6.9 μM (loading efficiency
= 16.8%), respectively (Figure S7d). HA-CNPs
with this triple drug loading were used for further biological studies.

To be successfully translated to clinical applications, the nanoparticles
should be stable in biological milieu for a prolonged time for effective
accumulation in tumor tissues by active and passive targeting.64,65 Hence, we evaluated the stability of HA-CNPs in cell culture media
for 7 days at body temperature. HA-CNPs were incubated in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) cell culture media containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C, and the hydrodynamic diameter,
polydispersity index (PDI), and surface charge were evaluated by DLS.
It was observed that HA-CNPs showed an increase in hydrodynamic diameter
from 160.4 ± 1.2 to 173.3 ± 1.0 nm at day 6 (Figure S8a). However, the size increased to 182.2
± 3.0 nm on day 7. On the other hand, the PDI value increased
marginally from 0.13 ± 0.01 to 0.0.19 ± 0.05 over 6 days
with a sudden increase to 0.38 ± 0.02 on day 7 (Figure S8b). Finally, the surface charge of the HA-CNPs decreased
continuously from −17.5 ± 0.1 to −8.2 ± 0.9
mV over 6 days and decreased to −6.2 ± 0.9 mV on the 7th
day (Figure S8c). From this stability assay,
it was evident that HA-CNPs remained stable in cell culture media
for 6 days, which is enough for them to be accumulated into tumor
tissues from blood circulation. However, the rapid increase in hydrodynamic
diameter, PDI, and surface charge after 7 days indicated that serum
proteins were absorbed on the nanoparticle surface leading to aggregation
after a week.

2.2 Cellular Internalization
We hypothesized
that HA-CNPs will be internalized into the acidic organelles like
lysosomes through endocytosis (Scheme 1c). To evaluate the subcellular localization of HA-CNPs,
we tagged the nanoparticles with a green fluorescent fluorescence
isothiocyanate (FITC). We treated FITC with the cholesterol–ethylenediamine
conjugate (6) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as
base to obtain the cholesterol–FITC conjugate (8) (Figure S9). 1H and 13C
NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF spectra confirmed the structure of
the cholesterol–FITC conjugate (Figures S10–S12). FITC-labeled HA-CNPs were synthesized by blending
conjugates 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with PC and DSPE-PEG in a ratiometric
manner, followed by hyaluronic acid coating to obtain HA-FITC-CNPs.
The size and ζ potential of FITC-CNP and HA-FITC-CNP were determined
by DLS study. The mean diameter and ζ potential of FITC-CNP
were found to be 142.4 nm and +34.6 mV (Figure S13a,b). Whereas the mean diameter and surface charge of HA-FITC-CNP
were determined to be 162.5 nm and −19.8 mV (Figure S13c,d). The size and surface charge of HA-FITC-CNP
and HA-CNP were found to be similar, which confirmed our choice of
HA-FITC-CNP for the cellular internalization study. To evaluate the
cellular internalization of nanoparticles, we treated CD44 receptor
overexpressed HCT-116 colon cancer cells with green fluorescent HA-FITC-CNPs
at different time points (1, 3, and 6 h) followed by staining the
acidic compartments by LysoTracker Red DND-99 (red fluorescent). The
cellular nucleus was subsequently stained with blue fluorescent DAPI.
High-resolution fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
was used to visualize the cellular localization of HA-FITC-CNPs. From Figure 2, we observed that
HA-FITC-CNPs were internalized into HCT-116 cells and localized into
red fluorescently labeled acidic organelles (lysosomes) within 1 h.
However, over 3 and 6 h, a gradual decrease of HA-FITC-CNP internalization
and localization in lysosomes was visualized. To further validate
the above observation, we quantified the overlapping of green (HA-FITC-CNPs)
and red fluorescence (LysoTracker Red) signals from confocal images
through Pearson’s and Mander’s coefficients. Table S1 demonstrates that 77.3% volume colocalization
was found within 1 h. On the other hand, the % volume colocalization
of green and red fluorescence gradually decreased to 40.6 and 23.4%
at 3 and 6 h, respectively. This quantification indeed supported the
fluorescence confocal imaging study conclusion that HA-FITC-CNPs internalized
and homed into acidic organelles within 1 h, with a gradual decrease
over 6 h. We anticipated that over 6 h exposure of HCT-116 cells with
HA-CNPs, all HA-binding receptors were saturated by hyaluronic acid
on the nanoparticle surface, leading to reduced cellular uptake of
further nanoparticles.

cells after treatment with FITC-labeled HA-CNPs (green) at 1, 3, and
6 h. Lysosomes and nuclei were stained with LysoTracker Red DND-99
(red) and DAPI (blue), respectively. Yellow regions are indicating
the colocalization of HA-FITC-CNPs into lysosomes. Scale bar = 20
μm.

After localization into acidic
lysosomes, the HA-CNPs should release
their drug payload through cleavage of acid labile ester and Pt–O
coordinate bonds.49,50 To evaluate the drug release
in the acidic environment, we incubated HA-CNPs in pH = 5.5 solution
(lysosome mimic), and the released drugs were quantified in predetermined
time points through concentration versus absorbance calibration graphs
in UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure S7a–c). At pH = 5.5, it was found that nearly 81.3 ± 3.8% of Akt-mTOR
inhibitor PI103 was released after 72 h (Figure S14a). However, a slightly smaller amount (69.9 ± 8.6%)
of MEK inhibitor AZD6244 was released after 72 h. On the other hand,
only 58.5 ± 4.9% of DNA damaging drug cisplatin was found to
be released after 72 h. We attributed the different amount of inhibitor
and cytotoxic drug released in the acidic environment to the relatively
labile nature of the chemical bonds through which they are linked
with the cholesterol moiety. The phenolic ester linkage is highly
labile in acidic media leading to a higher amount of free PI103 release
from the HA-CNPs. On the other hand, the aliphatic ester linkage in
the cholesterol–AZD6244 conjugate made it a little less labile
in acidic media compared to the phenolic ester causing less release of AZD6244 even at 72 h compared to that of
PI103. Finally, the Pt–O coordinate bond is much less labile
compared to the phenolic and aliphatic ester linkages in acidic milieu.
Hence, cisplatin release was much less compared to that of PI103 and
AZD6244 after the same time interval (72 h). We expect that over prolonged
exposure in a tumor acidic environment, HA-CNPs would constantly release
the three drugs in a continuous manner.49 However, both the signaling inhibitors and the cytotoxic drug showed
controlled and continuous release over 3 days. To demonstrate that
the release of inhibitors and drug from HA-CNPs is pH dependent, we
incubated HA-CNPs in physiological medium (pH = 7.4) and quantified
drug release in a time dependent manner. It was found that only 25.0
± 0.6, 31.8 ± 4.4, and 19.7 ± 2.9% of PI103, AZD6244,
and cisplatin were released, respectively, even after 72 h (Figure S14b). It is also noteworthy that HA-CNPs
released negligible amounts of inhibitors and drugs (less than 10%)
within 1 h (before reaching the acidic lysosomes) at pH = 7.4, indicating
that the nanoparticles can safe-guard the loaded drugs before reaching
the drug release site. This drug release study evidently confirmed
that HA-CNPs released their payloads by a much improved amount in
an acidic environment compared to that in physiological medium. With
excellent stability in cell culture medium, we anticipate that HA-CNPs
would only release the drugs inside tumor tissues (acidic milieu)
and show the least premature drug release in blood circulation (physiological
milieu) before reaching the tumor tissues by passive and active targeting.

2.3 Mechanism of Cellular Internalization
Nanoparticles
can home into the lysosomal compartments through endocytosis
under different mechanisms (clathrin/caveolin-mediated endocytosis
and macropinocytosis).66 The exact mechanism
of endocytosis of HA-CNPs was evaluated. HCT-116 cells were pretreated
with specific endocytosis inhibitors (chlorpromazine, genistein, and
amiloride) followed by green fluorescent FITC-labeled HA-FITC-CNPs.
As a control, HCT-116 cells were treated with only HA-FITC-CNPs without
any pretreatment with endocytosis inhibitors. Cellular internalization
of HA-FITC-CNPs was visualized by CLSM. Confocal microscopy images
in Figure 3a evidently
show that genistein-treated cells engulfed HA-FITC-CNPs in a similar
way to the control cells. However, chlorpromazine pretreated cells
showed remarkable reduction in HA-FITC-CNP internalization. Interestingly,
on the other hand, amiloride pretreated cells demonstrated moderate
uptake of HA-FITC-CNPs leading to more nanoparticle internalization
compared to that of chlorpromazine-treated cells, but less compared
to that of genistein-treated cells. We further evaluated the cellular
uptake of HA-FITC-CNPs by quantifying the green fluorescence intensity
inside the cells from confocal images. It was assessed that genistein
pretreated cells showed only a 6% reduction in fluorescent intensity
compared to that of no-inhibitor treated cells (Figure S15). However, chlorpromazine and amiloride pretreated
cells demonstrated nearly 76 and 50% reduced fluorescent intensity
compared to that of control cells. The mechanism of endocytosis was
further evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. HCT-116 cells were
pretreated with endocytosis inhibitors (chlorpromazine, genistein,
and amiloride) followed by treatment with HA-FITC-CNPs. The fluorescently
labeled cells were quantified by flow cytometry assay. The flow cytometry
data clearly demonstrated that genistein-treated cells internalized
HA-FITC-CNPs as well as control cells (treated with HA-FITC-CNPs only
without any inhibitor pretreatment). However, interestingly, chlorpromazine-
and amiloride-treated cells reduced HA-FITC-CNP uptake remarkably
up to 94.5 and 47.2%, respectively (Figure 3b). As chlorpromazine, genistein, and amiloride
are inhibitors for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated
endocytosis, and macropinocytosis, respectively, these microscopy
and cell sorting analyses confirmed that HCT-116 cells took HA-FITC-CNPs
up by a combination of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis
mechanisms and homed them into acidic organelles like lysosomes.

Figure 3 HCT-116
colon cancer cells were pretreated with endocytosis inhibitors
(chlorpromazine, amiloride, and genestein) followed by treatment with
HA-FITC-CNPs (green fluorescent) to evaluate the mechanism of endocytosis
by (a) confocal microscopy. Nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue fluorescent).
Scale bar = 35 μm. (b) Flow cytometry analysis.

We hypothesized that the hyaluronic acid coating
over the chimeric
nanoparticles containing MAPK-PI3K signaling inhibitors will help
them to internalize by the interaction with the CD44 receptor overexpressed
on colon cancer cells. In our previous study, we screened a panel
of colon cancer cells and observed that HCT-116 cells highly overexpressed
CD44 receptors.50 To evaluate our hypothesis,
we pretreated HCT-116 cells with free hyaluronic acid to saturate
the CD44 receptors as well as receptors for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM)
followed by incubation with HA-FITC-CNPs (Figure 4a). The control cells were treated with only
HA-FITC-CNPs without pretreatment with HA. The internalization of
green fluorescent HA-FITC-CNPs was observed by high-resolution CLSM.
From Figure 4b, it
can clearly be observed that HA pretreated cells internalized a highly
reduced amount of HA-FITC-CNPs giving considerably less green fluorescence
signal in confocal microscopy. Whereas, without any HA pretreatment,
HCT-116 cells engulfed a large amount of HA-FITC-CNPs giving rise
to high fluorescence intensity in microscopy. Furthermore, the confocal
imaging data was validated with flow cytometry analysis. After pretreatment
with HA followed by HA-FITC-CNP incubation, the fluorescently labeled
HCT-116 cells were quantified by flow cytometry. It was observed from
the cytometry analysis that HA pretreated cells were labeled with
HA-FITC-CNPs to a remarkably lesser extent. On the other hand, non-HA
pretreated cells were highly labeled with green fluorescence from
HA-FITC-CNP internalization (Figure 4c). From these fluorescence microscopy and cell sorting
analyses, it was established that HA-FITC-CNPs were internalized into
lysosomes of HCT-116 cells through HA-CD44 interaction mediated endocytosis.

2.4 Targeting MAPK-PI3K Signaling Hub
It was hypothesized that after internalization into acidic lysosomes,
HA-CNPs will release AZD6244 and PI103 for simultaneous inhibition
of MAPK-PI3K signaling hub. To validate our hypothesis, we treated
HCT-116 cells with HA-CNPs for 24 h and the expression of MAPK and
PI3K signaling proteins was evaluated by western blot analysis. Phosphorylation
of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in MAPK signaling cascade
should be inhibited by AZD6244 through perturbation of MEK. From western
blot images in Figure 5a, it was observed that expression of p-ERK was
highly reduced after treatment with HA-CNPs whereas the amount of
total ERK remained unperturbed. Quantification from the protein-expression
analysis also validated that HA-CNPs reduced the expression of p-ERK by 2.5-fold compared to that of the non-nanoparticle
treated control cells (Figure S16a). On
the other hand, PI103 was expected to inhibit PI3K signaling by inhibiting
phosphorylation of Akt. To evaluate the effect of the nanoparticles
on PI3K signaling, we treated HCT-116 cells with HA-CNPs for 24 h
and the expression of p-Akt was determined by western
blot analysis. The gel electrophoresis in Figure 5a clearly demonstrates that HA-CNPs reduced
the expression of p-Akt while keeping the total amount
of Akt protein the same. Further quantification from western blot
analysis showed that HA-CNPs reduced the expression of p-Akt by nearly 1.5-fold compared to that of the control cells (Figure S16b). Finally, we evaluated the effect
of cisplatin-mediated DNA damage in HCT-116 cells. The poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) family of proteins are upregulated as a consequence
of DNA damage in cancer cells, making them the markers for DNA damage.67,68 HCT-116 cells were treated with HA-CNPs for 24 h and the expression
of PARP was visualized through Western blot analysis. The gel electrophoresis
in Figure 5a shows
that HA-CNPs increased the expression of PARP through DNA damage.
Further quantification from western blot analysis revealed that HA-CNPs
increased the expression of PARP by 7.4-fold compared to that of the
non-nanoparticle treated cells (Figure S16c). These gel electrophoresis studies evidently
confirmed that HA-CNPs inhibited MAPK-PI3K signaling hub simultaneously
with DNA damage in colon cancer cells.

determined by flow cytometry analysis. (d) Cell viability of HCT-116
cells after treatment with HA-CNPs and free drug cocktail for 24 h
was determined by MTT assay.

2.5 Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis
Inhibition
of MAPK-PI3K signaling hub along with DNA damage leads to cell cycle
arrest.69,70 We assessed the potential of HA-CNPs to
arrest the cell cycle of colon cancer cells. HCT-116 cells were treated
with HA-CNPs for 24 h followed by staining the cellular DNA with propedium
iodide (PI), and the cells in different stages of the cell cycle were
quantified through flow cytometry analysis. The flow cytometry analysis
in Figure 5b reveals
that HA-CNP treated cells were in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases in
87.86, 6.39, and 4.9%, respectively. Whereas, control cells were found
to be in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases in 24.26, 11.65, and 65.45%,
respectively. From this cytometry analysis, it was confirmed that
HA-CNPs stalled the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase in HCT-116 cells.

Cell cycle arrest into the G0/G1 phase would lead the cancer cells
into programmed cell death or apoptosis.64 We further evaluated the induction of apoptosis by HA-CNPs through
flow cytometry analysis. HCT-116 cells were treated with HA-CNPs for
24 h and the phosphatidylserine flipped at the outer surface of the
apoptotic cells was stained with green fluorescent FITC-labeled Annexin
V. The DNA of the late apoptotic and necrotic cells was counter stained
with red fluorescent propedium iodide. The cells in different apoptotic
and necrotic stages were quantified with fluorescence cell sorting
analysis. The flow cytometry analysis in Figure 5c demonstrated that HA-CNPs induced a remarkably
higher number of cells into early (60.08%) and late (30.06%) apoptosis.
On the other hand, non-nanoparticle treated control cells showed only
7.21 and 6.85% of cells in early and late apoptotic stages, respectively.
This cytometry data clearly confirmed that HA-CNP mediated inhibition
of MAPK-PI3K signaling hub in combination with DNA damage followed
by cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase triggered the colon cancer
cells into apoptosis.

2.6 Cell Death
One
of the hallmarks of
cancer is to resist programmed cell death or apoptosis.71 Hence, induction of apoptosis to the cancer
cells would lead to cell death. We evaluated the potential of HA-CNPs
to trigger cell death in colon cancer cells. HCT-116 cells were treated
with HA-CNPs in a dose-dependent manner over 24 h, and the amount
of viable cells was determined by MTT assay. As a control, we treated
HCT-116 cells with a cocktail of free inhibitors (AZD6244 and PI103)
and cisplatin in the same ratio present in HA-CNPs (AZD6144/PI103/CDDP
= 1.5:1.4:1). It was found that HA-CNPs killed HCT-116 cells with
an extremely reduced IC50 = 0.91 ± 0.09 μM with
only 13.7 ± 1.2% viable cells at 25 μM concentration of
AZD6244 (Figure 5d).
Whereas a combination of free AZD6244, PI103, and cisplatin showed
much a higher IC50 = 5.7 ± 0.8 μM with high
cell viability (35.7 ± 5.8%) at 25 μM concentration of
AZD6244. To assess whether the HA-CNPs were more effective compared
to their dual drug-loaded counterparts; we synthesized HA-AZD-CDDP-NPs,
HA-AZD-PI103-NPs, and HA-PI103-CDDP-NPs by using the same method and
having the same drug loading. We further treated HCT-116 cells with
HA-coated dual drug-loaded nanoparticles in a dose-dependent manner
for 24 h and cell viability was quantified by MTT assay. Interestingly,
it was observed that HA-AZD-CDDP-NPs, HA-AZD-PI103-NPs, and HA-PI103-CDDP-NPs
showed much higher IC50 = 2.96 ± 0.33, 13.0 ±
1.13, and 6.05 ± 0.86 μM, respectively, compared to that
of HA-CNPs (Figure S17a–c). Moreover,
HA-AZD-CDDP-NPs, HA-AZD-PI013-NPs, and HA-PI103-CDDP-NPs demonstrated
much less efficacy in killing HCT-116 cells in the highest concentration
(25 μM), as indicated by high cell viability, 24.6 ± 4.4,
47.2 ± 3.1, and 34.9 ± 5.7%.

One of the major challenges
of nanoparticle-mediated targeting of MAPK-PI3K signaling hubs in
cancer cells specifically is not to induce any off-target toxicity
to the healthy cells. To address this issue, we further evaluated
the effect of HA-CNPs on L929 fibroblast cells. L929 cells were incubated
with HA-CNPs in a dose-dependent manner for 24 h and the cellular
viability was measured by MTT assay. Interestingly, it was found that,
HA-CNPs showed almost no toxicity to the fibroblast cells even at
the highest concentration (cell viability = 107.1 ± 4.5% at 25
μM concentration of AZD6244) (Figure S17d). From these cell viability assays, it was confirmed that HA-CNPs
showed remarkable efficacy in HCT-116 colon cancer cells when compared
to that of the free drug cocktail as well as the HA-coated dual drug-loaded
nanoparticles. Moreover, HA-CNPs showed negligible toxicity toward
healthy fibroblast cells, which showed their benign nature toward
noncancerous cells.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have engineered sub-200 nm size hyaluronic acid-coated
cholesterol-based chimeric nanoparticles (HA-CNPs) that can simultaneously
enclose MAPK-PI3K signaling hub inhibitors (AZD6244 and PI103) along
with DNA impairing drug (cisplatin) in a ratiometric manner. These
HA-CNPs were internalized into HCT-116 colon cancer cells through
a combination of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis,
and CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis, and they were homed into lysosomes.
MAPK-PI3K signaling hub was inhibited in combination with DNA damage
by these HA-CNPs. Furthermore, HCT-116 cells were stalled in the G0/G1
phase in the cell cycle, leading to early and late apoptosis by HA-CNPs.
Finally, remarkable cell death was induced by HA-CNPs on HCT-116 cells
compared to that of the free drug combinations as well as HA-coated
dual drug-loaded nanoparticles keeping healthy fibroblast cells unharmed.
These HA-CNPs have the potential to be a platform technology for targeting
multiple oncogenic signaling hubs toward next-generation targeted
therapy for colon cancer.

4.2 Synthesis of Cholesterol–Succinic Acid
Conjugate (2)
Cholesterol–succinic acid conjugate
(2) was synthesized from cholesterol (1) by using the procedure previously
described.49 In short, cholesterol (100
mg, 0.26 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of a pyridine/dichloromethane
(DCM) mixture (1:1 vol/vol) followed by addition of succinic anhydride
(130 mg, 1.3 mmol) and a catalytic amount of DMAP. The reaction was
stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The progression of the reaction
was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). After the starting
material was completely consumed, pyridine and DCM were evaporated,
and the crude compound was further dissolved in 5 mL of DCM. Crude
product in DCM was washed with 1 N HCl (10 mL) and water (10 mL).
The organic layer was then separated using a separating funnel and
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Crude product was
filtered and DCM was evaporated under reduced pressure. Pure cholesterol–succinic
acid conjugate (2) was obtained in 77% yield after purification through
silica gel column chromatography using 1% methanol in DCM as mobile
phase.

4.3 Synthesis of Cholesterol–AZD6244 Conjugate
(3)
Cholesterol–succinic acid conjugate (2) (5 mg,
0.01 mmol) was dissolved in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) (2 mL) followed
by addition of EDCI (5.68 mg, 0.015 mmol) and DMAP (2.5 μL,
0.015 mmol) into the reaction mixture and stirred for 10 min. AZD6244
(6.9 mg, 0.012 mmol) was added into the reaction mixture and stirred
for 24 h at room temperature. The progression of the reaction was
followed by thin layer chromatography. To quench the reaction, 0.1
N HCl solution was added into the reaction mixture. The organic layer
was washed with water (10 mL × 2) and brine (5 mL × 2).
The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and finally, the solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure. Crude product was purified by silica gel column with dichloromethane/methanol
as the eluent to afford a pure cholesterol–AZD6244 conjugate
(3) in 78% yield.

4.4 Synthesis of Cholesterol–PI103
Conjugate
(4)
Synthesis and characterization of cholesterol–PI103
conjugate were performed by a previously described method.49 In short, cholesterol–succinic acid conjugate
(2) (21 mg, 0.04 mmol) was dissolved in dry DMF (2 mL) followed by
addition of EDCI (8 mg, 0.04 mmol) and DMAP (5 mg, 0.04 mmol). The
reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. PI103 (5 mg,
0.014 mmol) was added into the reaction mixture and stirred for another
24 h at room temperature. After the complete consumption of starting
material (monitored by TLC), the reaction was quenched with 1 N HCl
(5 mL) and diluted with DCM (10 mL). The organic layer was washed
with water (10 mL × 2) and brine (10 mL). The organic layer was
then separated and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 followed by filtration. Organic solvent was further evaporated under
vacuum to obtain crude product. Pure cholesterol–PI103 conjugate
(4) was obtained in 72% yield after purification through silica gel
column chromatography using 1% methanol in DCM as mobile phase.

4.5 Synthesis of Cholesterol–Cisplatin
Conjugate (5)
Cholesterol–cisplatin conjugate (5)
was synthesized by previously described methods.63 Cholesterol–succinic acid conjugate (2) (5 mg, 0.01
mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of DMF and aquated cisplatin (600 μL
= 3.08 mg, 0.01 mmol) was added into it. The reaction mixture was
stirred for 24 h. After 24 h, solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporator
and the crude cholesterol–succinic acid–cisplatin conjugate
(5) was obtained in 90% yield.

4.6 Synthesis
of Cholesterol–Ethylenediamine
Conjugate (6)
Cholesterol–ethylenediamine conjugate
(6) was synthesized starting from cholesteryl chloroformate (7) and
ethylenediamine.63 Briefly, ethylenediamine
(1 mL, 15.6 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (5 mL) and cooled to 0
°C. Cholesteryl chloroformate (7) (500 mg, 1.1 mmol) was dissolved
into 5 mL of dry DCM and added drop wise into cold ethylenediamine
solution for 20 min with stirring. The reaction mixture was allowed
to come to room temperature and stirred for 24 h. The reaction was
quenched with water (10 mL) and washed thoroughly with water (15 mL
× 3). The organic layer was further washed with brine (5 mL)
followed by drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, it was then filtered
and evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain cholesterol–ethylenediamine
conjugate (6) in 76% yield.

4.7 Synthesis of Cholesterol–FITC
Conjugate
(8)
Conjugate 6 (10 mg, 0.0211 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL
of anhydrous DMF. To this solution, 12.3 mg (0.031 mmol) of fluorescence
isothiocyanate (FITC) was added followed by the addition of 3.6 μL
(2.2 mmol) of DIPEA. The reaction was stirred in the dark at room
temperature for 24 h. Progression of the reaction was followed by
TLC. The reaction was quenched with water (5 mL), and 30 mL of dichloromethane
was added into it. The organic layer was washed with water (30 mL
× 3). The organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. Crude
product was purified by silica gel column with dichloromethane/methanol
as the eluent to afford pure cholesterol–FITC conjugate (8)
in 60% yield.

4.8 Synthesis of Hyaluronic
Acid-Coated Chimeric
Nanoparticles
Synthesis of chimeric nanoparticles was performed
by using the procedure described in ref (49). Briefly, 6 mg of l-α-phosphatidylcholine,
1 mg of each of the cholesterol–drug conjugates (3, 4, and
5), 3 mg of cholesterol–ethylenediamine conjugate (6), and
0.6 mg of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polythylene glycol)2000] (DSPE-PEG2000) were dissolved in 5.0 mL of DCM in a round bottom flask. Organic
solvent was slowly evaporated under vacuum to form a thin and uniform
lipid layer with constant rotation in the rotary evaporator. Any trace
of organic solvent was removed under high vacuum for 30 min. The drug-containing
lipid layer was further hydrated with 1 mL of double distilled water
for 2 h at 60 °C. The nanoparticles formed after the hydration
step were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove unwanted
bigger particles. After passing through the Sephadex size exclusion
column, the nanoparticles were extruded through (minimum 15 cycles
of extrusion) a 200 nm Whatmann polycarbonate membrane at 60 °C
to obtain the CNPs. Further, hyaluronic acid was coated on the CNPs
to obtain HA-CNPs by the protocol previously described.50 Typically, to the above resultant CNP solution,
0.5 mL of (0.5 mg/mL) hyaluronic acid solution was added drop wise
under rigorous stirring. After 10 min, hyaluronic acid-coated CNPs
were centrifuged at 45 000g. The HA-CNP pellets
were washed with water to remove the excess hyaluronic acid. HA-CNPs
were resuspended in water and stored at 4 °C for further use.

4.9 Size, Surface Charge, Shape, and Morphology
Determination
Hydrodynamic diameter and surface charge of
CNPs and HA-CNPs were determined by dynamic light scattering using
a Zetasizer Nano2590 (Malvern, U.K.). CNPs or HA-CNPs (30 μL)
were suspended in 1 mL of double distilled water and scattering of
light was measured at a 90° angle to obtain the hydrodynamic
diameter. The measurements were performed in triplicate.

HA-CNPs
(5 μL) in water were drop-casted on either a silicon chip without
dopant (for FESEM) or on a mica sheet (for AFM) and dried under reduced
pressure for 2 h. For FESEM, the silicon chip was then coated with
gold having 30–40 nm layers by a Quorum Q150T-E5. A Carl Zeiss,
Ultra plus SEM was used at 4 kV voltage to measure the FESEM images.
NanoWizard AFM was used for force microscopy.72

4.10 Quantification of Triple Drug Loading in
HA-CNPs
Concentration versus absorbance calibration graphs
were determined from UV–vis spectroscopy at λmax = 296, 267, and 706 nm for PI103, AZD6244, and cisplatin, respectively.
For quantification of drug loading, HA-CNPs were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) in three different concentrations (5, 10, and 15%)
and absorbance was measured. Loading of PI103 and AZD6244 was measured
from absorbance versus concentration graphs. To evaluate cisplatin
loading, 100 μL of HA-CNPs was dissolved in 400 μL of o-phenelenediamine solution in DMSO (1.2 mg/mL). The mixture
was heated at 100 °C for 4 h until a bluish-green coloration
appeared. Absorbance of the solution was measured at λmax = 706 nm and cisplatin loading was calculated from the calibration
curve. Drug loading was quantified in triplicate.49,63

4.11 Drug Release from HA-CNPs
Release
of PI103, AZD6244, and cisplatin was determined by a dialysis method
in pH = 5.5 and 7.4.49 The amount of PI103,
AZD6244, and cisplatin released at predetermined time points was quantified
by UV–vis spectroscopy at λmax = 296, 267,
and 706 nm, respectively. Released PI103, AZD6244, and cisplatin at
each time point were quantified in triplicate.

4.12 Stability Determination of HA-CNPs
Stability of HA-CNPs
was assessed by DLS. 100 μL of HA-CNPs
was incubated in DMEM media having 10% FBS at 37 °C for 7 days.
Hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index, and surface charge were
evaluated at different time points and plotted.

4.13 Cellular Internalization by Confocal Microscopy
A total
of 50 000 HCT-116 cells were seeded on coverslips
in a six-well plate. After 24 h, cells were treated with HA-FITC-CNPs
at an FITC concentration of 2 μg/mL at 37 °C for 1, 3,
and 6 h. After each time point, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and fixed with paraformaldehyde solution (4%) for 15
min at 4 °C. Lysosomes and nuclei were stained by LysoTracker
Red DND-99 and DAPI for 45 min and 5 min, respectively. Cells were
washed with PBS and mounted on a glass slide using 5 μL of SlowFade
diamond antifade reagent. The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy
(Zeis LSM 710). HCT-116 cells were pretreated with different endocytosis
inhibitors followed by treatment with HA-FITC-CNPs. The cellular internalization
was further visualized by confocal microscopy.50

For hyaluronic acid-mediated cellular uptake, HCT-116
cells in six-well plates were treated with 2 mL of serum-free cell
culture media containing 5 mg/mL HA for 2 h followed by treatment
with HA-FITC-CNPs for a further 2 h. The cells were then visualized
by confocal microscopy.

4.14 Cellular Internalization
by Flow Cytometry
A total of 105 HCT-116 cells
were treated with various
endocytosis inhibitors (amiloride, genistein, and chlorpromazine)
at a concentration of 100, 30, and 37 μM, respectively, for
30 min at 37 °C. Control cells were incubated at 37 °C without
any treatment of inhibitor. The fluorescently labeled cells were counted
by using a BD FACS Calibur.50

For
hyaluronic acid-mediated cellular uptake, HCT-116 cells in six-well
plates were treated with 2 mL of serum-free cell culture media containing
5 mg/mL HA for 2 h followed by treatment with HA-FITC-CNPs for a further
2 h. The fluorescently labeled cells were counted by using a BD FACS
Calibur.

4.15 Western Blot Analysis
A total of
1.5 × 105 HCT-116 cells were treated with HA-CNPs
for 24 h followed by cell lysis and suspension in sample buffer. Proteins
were visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
using primary antibody solution (p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2
in 1:2000 dilution, and GAPDH in 1:5000 dilution) and then incubated
in HRP conjugated secondary antibody solution (1:10 000 dilution).49,50

4.16 Detection of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry
A total of 2 × 105 HCT-116 cells were attached
in a six-well plate followed by treatment with HA-CNPs for 24 h. After
24 h, cell medium was aspirated and cells were centrifuged at 750
rpm for 2 min and washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in 100 μL
of Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide solution followed by incubation
at room temperature for 5 min in the dark. Further analysis of apoptosis
was performed by using a BD FACS Calibur.72

4.17 Cell Cycle Analysis
A total of 2
× 106 HCT-116 cells were attached in a six-well plate
followed by treatment with HA-CNPs for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized,
washed with PBS, and centrifuged. Cell palettes were fixed with 70%
ice-cold ethanol for 30 min. Fixed cells were further stained with
propidium iodide and analyzed with BD FACS Calibur.72

4.18 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
Assay
A total
of 5000 HCT-116 cells were attached in a 96-well plate and treated
with HA-CNPs in a concentration-dependent manner for 24 h. A free
drug cocktail was used as control. MTT reagent (20 μL/well)
was added and further incubated for 4 h followed by solubilizing formazan
crystals. UV–vis spectroscopy was used to measure absorbance
at λmax = 550 nm to calculate cell viability. All
experiments were performed in triplicate.72
