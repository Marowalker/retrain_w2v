A ligand exchange of one of the acetonitrile
ligands of the (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–phenyloxazoline
complex (Ru(II)–Pheox)
by pyridine was demonstrated, and the location of the exchange reaction
was examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study
the mechanism of its catalytic asymmetric reactions. The acetonitrile
was smoothly exchanged with a pyridine to afford the corresponding
(pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox complex with
a trans orientation (C–Ru–N(pyridine)) in a quantitative
yield, and the complex was analyzed by single-crystal X-ray analysis.
DFT calculations indicated that the most eliminable acetonitrile is
the trans group, which is consistent with the X-ray analysis. The
direction of the ligand exchange is thus determined on the basis of
the energy gap of the ligand elimination instead of the stability
of the metal complex. These results suggested that a reactant in a
Ru–Pheox-catalyzed reaction should approach trans to the C–Ru
bond to generate chirality on the Ru center.

1 Introduction
Development
of transition-metal-catalyzed carbene transfer reactions,
such as cyclopropanation of a π bond and C–H insertion
reactions, have recently attracted great interest.1 Recently, we reported that (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–phenyloxazoline
complex (Ru(II)–Pheox), which has a unique C1-symmetric structure, is an efficient catalyst for carbene
transfer reactions. We successfully demonstrated that a series of
Ru(II)–Pheox complexes could promote catalytic asymmetric intra-
and intermolecular cyclopropanations of a wide variety of olefins
and asymmetric Si–H insertion reactions with diazo compounds
to give the desired products in high yields with high enantioselectivities.2 On the other hand, details on the generation
of the metal–carbene complex from Ru(II)–Pheox and a
diazo compound in the initial stage of the reaction remain scarce.
In addition, the crystallinity of the Ru(II)–Pheox complex
was low and its X-ray crystal structure has not been reported. Herein,
we report structural and theoretical studies on the ligand exchange
reaction of a Ru(II)–Pheox complex, including (1) an experimental
chemical method to determine the structure of the complex by X-ray
analysis and (2) a computational method to analyze the behavior around
the ruthenium center by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
This is the first report to analyze the ligand exchange reaction using
DFT calculation and X-ray analysis.

2 Results
and Discussion
The ligand exchange from acetonitrile to pyridine
on Ru(II)–Pheox
proceeded smoothly in the presence of pyridine (1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 at room temperature, and the desired Ru(II)–Pheox
complex with one pyridine ligand and three acetonitrile ligands was
obtained in quantitative yield. Surprisingly, compared with the (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–Pheox complex, (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3 Ru(II)–Pheox has a high crystallinity and pure
single crystals were obtained. The results of single-crystal X-ray
analysis of the (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox
complex are shown in Figure 1 and Tables S1–S6. The site
selectivity of the elimination of acetonitrile and coordination of
pyridine might be affected by the trans effect of the C–Ru–ligand
and proceed selectively at (A). On the basis of the experimental
results, we examined the stability of various Ru(II)–Pheox
complex with ligands by density functional theory (DFT) using the
Gaussian 16 program.3 The LanL2DZ4 basis set for Ru and 6-31G(d)5 for other atoms in combination with the B3LYP6 hybrid functional were used for all calculations.

Figure 1 X-ray
analysis of the (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox
complex.

Initially, we investigated the
structural stability of (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox.
The most stable structure is d, which has a pyridine
in the (D) direction. One of
the optimized structures a, which has the same complex
as the X-ray structure in Figure 1, is slightly higher in energy than b, c, and d (Figures 2 and S3, Table S7). In addition,
other calculation levels also give the same results (Tables S8 and S9). These results suggested that the (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox complex is formed by kinetic control not
thermodynamic controlled product.

The bond length of Ru–N1
by X-ray analysis of (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox
is clearly longer than that of the other
three Ru–N bonds although pyridine nitrogen can coordinate
to Ru(II) more strongly than acetonitrile nitrogen. These suggest
that the rate for elimination of acetonitrile on site (A) differs from that for others. Thus, we calculated the energy gap
for the elimination of an acetonitrile from (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–Pheox. The result of DFT calculation shows as e (Figure 3(1)). Each of the Ru–N(acetonitrile) bond lengths in (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–Pheox complex e were scanned in
CH2Cl2 solvent (using polarizable continuum
model (PCM)7) to determine the kinetically
most favorable ligand elimination pathway (Figure 3(2), Tables S11 and S12). The results showed that the energy gap of the elimination of acetonitrile
at (A) is the lowest energy pathway.

Furthermore, these energies were
also calculated for Ru(II)–Pheox
complexes with three acetonitrile ligands and one vacant coordination
site on the ruthenium atom ((acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox)
by the DFT calculations. As a result, the energy of the structure
with the three acetonitriles shows the same result with Figure 3(2) and the elimination of
acetonitrile at (A) is clearly lower (by more than 12
kcal/mol) than the energies of the other structures (Figure 4, Table S10).

complex (f–i).

These results indicate that (A) is the most
eliminable
position in this complex. The elimination of acetonitrile and insertion
of pyridine into Ru(II)–Pheox should proceed from (A) on the basis of the stability of the elimination by kinetic control
in the initial stage of the catalytic cycle. The selectivity may be
due to the trans effect of the C–Ru ligand and accordingly
affect the enantioselectivity of carbene transfer reactions using
Ru(II)–Pheox complexes.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated
the ligand exchange reaction of an acetonitrile
of (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–phenyloxazoline (Ru(II)–Pheox)
with a pyridine and examined the reaction by DFT calculations. This
ligand exchange reaction proceeded site selectively from the position
trans to C–Ru bond (A). DFT calculations show
that the direction of the ligand exchange is determined on the basis
of the energy gap of the ligand elimination instead of the stability
of the metal complex. The results provide important information for
understanding the behavior around the Ru atom in an organometallic
complex, which will allow the design of new and more efficient C1-symmetric catalyst systems.

4 Experimental Section
To a solution of (acetonitrile)4Ru(II)–Pheox
complex 1 (64.7 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 2.0 mL of CH2Cl2 was added pyridine (8.1 mL, 0.1 mmol) in one portion.
The mixture was stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The resulting
mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give (pyridine)(acetonitrile)3Ru(II)–Pheox complex 2 (68.6 mg, >99%
yield) as a yellow solid.
