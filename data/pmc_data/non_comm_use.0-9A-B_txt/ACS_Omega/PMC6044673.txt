By applying calculations based on
density functional theory, and
on density functional perturbation theory, together with generalized
gradient approximation-Perdew–Burke–Emzerho and screened
Coulomb hybrid HSE06 functionals, we predict novel and suitable fundamental
parameters of the stable monoclinic Ta0.75V0.25ON semiconductor for solar water splitting. In addition to its predicted
bandgap of 2.0 eV in the required zone for solar-driven water splitting,
this material reveals a high visible-light absorption coefficient,
high static dielectric constant, high hole and electron mobilities
along the [001] and [010] crystallographic directions, relatively
low exciton binding energy, and suitable band edge energy levels for
oxidizing water and reducing protons. The optical, charge-carrier
transport, and redox features predicted for this material are found
to be considerably better than those obtained for Ta3N5, which is the most common semiconductor photocatalyst used
in visible-light-driven water splitting.

1 Introduction
Producing hydrogen from
water splitting using powder photocatalysts
under sunlight is a low-cost, attractive, and scalable technology.1,2 Besides the good crystallinity required for the prepared material,
finding a new good candidate photocatalyst for solar water splitting
requests at least the following challenging fundamental parameters
to be present in the semiconductor as a photon absorber: (1) adequate
bandgap energy (greater than 1.23 eV and near 2.0 eV) to absorb a
large amount of photons in the visible region, which corresponds to
43% of the direct sunlight at Earth’s surface; (2) static dielectric
constant greater than 10 accompanied by a binding energy of the exciton
smaller than 25 meV to achieve a good ability for the exciton to be
dissociated into free carriers;3−8 (3) smaller hole and electron effective masses than 0.5m0 (m0 denotes the mass of
free electron) to obtain good transport properties;3,9,10 (4) relative band edge energy levels suitable
for splitting water, to provide enough driving forces to the created
holes and photoexcited electrons for water oxidation and proton reduction.11

It has been clearly demonstrated in previous
computational studies12−29 that the calculated fundamental parameters mentioned above of widely
used semiconductors in photocatalysis and photovoltaics can accurately
predict the experimental data by means of density functional theory
(DFT) using the screened Coulomb and hybrid exchange-correlation functional
HSE06.30,31 By applying this computational scheme, we
have recently shown interesting dielectric, charge-carrier transport,
and redox features of (Ta1–xNbx)ON solid solution materials (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) for water splitting, whereas they revealed
almost UV light absorption features due to their large predicted direct
bandgaps in the 2.8–3.0 eV range.23 In addition, we have recently predicted suitable optoelectronic
features of VON polymorphs for photovoltaic applications with computed
bandgaps of 1.3 and 1.4 eV,26 located in
the suitable range for good efficiency.32

Getting inspired from the two previous studies, we present
here
a detailed theoretical investigation on the required physicochemical
parameters of (Ta1–xVx)ON (x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5) semiconductor
compounds that could be used for solar water splitting, following
the above invoked accurate first-principles quantum computations.
Besides the structure and stability of the studied systems, we studied
their optoelectronic and redox properties with various V contents.
We also compared the computed data to those acquired for Ta3N5, which is the most common semiconductor used in visible-light-driven
photocatalytic water splitting. The adequate bandgap energy (2.0 eV)
predicted for the Ta0.75V0.25ON material as
well as the high static dielectric constant, the small hole and electron
effective masses, the low exciton binding energy, and the appropriate
locations of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the
oxidation and reduction potentials of water indicate the potential
for this material to be effective in water splitting for hydrogen
production under solar energy.

2 Computational Details
Simulation of Ta(1–x)VxON structures was performed by considering the monoclinic
crystalline structure of TaON (space group P21/c; Ta is in Wyckoff position 4e) as experimentally
identified using the neutron and synchrotron diffraction analysis.21,24,33,34 Several structural configurations with different V contents were
generated starting from the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell model of
TaON, which contains 32 functional units, by substituting various
Ta atoms with V. Particular attention was paid to key structures showing
well-dispersed or agglomerated V to identify the lowest energy configurations.
The generic Ta(32–p)VpO32N32 supercell model adoped
in the calculations leads to the corresponding stoichiometry Ta(1–x)VxON (x = p/32). Ta(1–x)VxON structures with x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 were modeled by giving p values of 4, 8, and 16, respectively. The explored structural
configurations were fully relaxed by DFT using the VASP program35−38 along with the Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof (PBE) functional39 and the projector-augmented plane wave approach.40 The considered valence electrons were 5d36s2 for Ta, 3p63d44s1 for V, 2s22p4 for O, and 2s22p3 for N. A 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack-type k-point grid was considered to sample the Brillouin zone.41

Thermodynamic stability of the explored
Ta(1–x)VxON materials relative
to the pure TaON and VON phases was investigated using the reaction
indicated in eq 1 1  The reaction energy was computed using eq 2 2  where Eform(Ta(1–x)VxON) is the formation energy of Ta(1–x)VxON, which was computed using eq 3 3  As can be seen, eq 3 takes into account the
0 K electronic energy
of Ta(1–x)VxON, Ta, and V solids in the most stable configurations and
of N2 and O2 molecules in the gas phase and
the thermal component of the chemical potentials of nitrogen (ΔμN) and oxygen (ΔμO), which depend on
the temperature and pressure through the entropy and enthalpy terms
of each molecule in the gas phase, as indicated in eq 4 4  Note that the thermal contributions of each
gas phase molecule were calculated with the DMol program42 by applying the PBE functional in connection
with the DNP basis set43 by systematically
including the zero point vibrational energy, whereas those for solids
were not considered. The electronic energies of the solid-state systems
and molecules were calculated with VASP. Here, ΔμO and ΔμN were set to −0.22 and
−0.18 eV, respectively, to be under standard conditions (T = 298 K and p(O2) = p(N2) = 1 atm). Positive or negative reaction
energy leads to a less or more stable system than TaON or VON. Note
that the formation energies of TaON and VON solids in eq 2 were calculated using eq 3 for x = 0 and
1, respectively.

Investigating the electronic structures of
Ta(1–x)VxON semiconductor compounds
was done by DFT with the HSE06 exchange-correlation functional,30,31 using the VASP software.35−38 The optical spectra were simulated using the sum
over empty states approach as described in VASP together with HSE06.
The absorption coefficient of solids was calculated as in eq 5 5  where
λ and ω correspond to the
frequency and wavelength of the upcoming photon. k(ω) represents the imaginary part of the refractive index,
which is defined by eq 6 6  The imaginary part ε2(ω)
of the frequency-dependent dielectric function is obtained from the
momentum matrix elements of transitions between the various filled
to empty states, as in eq 7 7  Here, k is the k-point in the Brillouin zone,
Ω represents the unit cell volume,
ω is the incident light frequency, and v and c are the respective valence and conduction bands. Ψkv and Ψkc represent the
eigenstates, û the external field vector with r the momentum operator. As the dielectric function describes
the causal response, the real part ε1(ω) was
derived from the imaginary part through the transformation of Kramers–Kronig,
see eq 8 8  where P is the principal
integral value. More detailed information about this methodology is
given in refs (44−46).

The dielectric
constant tensor at high frequency (ε∞) of
the crystal was obtained by computing the self-consistent response
while applying an electric field from the external region,47 using VASP with HSE06. This method includes
local field effects by optimizing the crystal orbitals after applying
the electric field. The vibrational dielectric constant (εvib) tensor was determined by computing the spectrum of phonons
using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) approach along
with the linear response approach, as ascribed in VASP with the PBE
functional. The static dielectric constant tensor (ε0) was then deduced from the addition of both optical and vibrational
parts.

The tensors of hole and electron effective masses generated
on
the energy levels of the band edges of the semiconductor were obtained
from the HSE06-computed electronic band structure through eq 9 9  Here, i and j represent the reciprocal
components and En(k) is the k-space
dispersion relation for the n-th band level. The
second derivatives of the energy with respect to the wave vector in
the Brillouin zone were numerically computed by means of the finite
difference approach.48

The binding
energy of the exciton was calculated using the hydrogenic
model49 and eq 10 10  Here, RH is Rydberg’s
constant in the atom of hydrogen (13.6 eV), m0 denotes the mass of the free electron, ε0 is the arithmetic average of the tensor values in the three main
crystal orientations, and μ is the reduced mass of the exciton
given by eq 11 11  where mh* and me* denote the geometric
averages of the tensor
values in the three main crystal orientations.

Ta0.75V0.25ON–vacuum interface was
simulated by building a () slab containing eight atomic layers with
a vacuum along the  direction
to select the (001) surface.
The slab was fully optimized by maintaining the cell parameters constant
at the bulk relaxed values. The thickness of vacuum was carefully
refined to neglect any possible electron interaction of the two opposite
slab borders. Moreover, the slab thickness required to reproduce the
bulk bandgap was also carefully checked. A thickness of 20 Å
for the slab (eight atomic layers) and a thickness of 20 Å for
the vacuum well reproduced the bulk signature of this semiconductor
compound. The absolute energy of vacuum was deduced from the calculation
of the averaged local potential along planes that are parallel to
the (001) surface of Ta0.75V0.25ON using the
HSE06 functional, as described in VASP. The correction of possible
errors generated by the periodic conditions was done by adding dipole
corrections to the total local potential calculation.50

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
of Crystal Structure and
Thermodynamics
The stability of the explored (Ta1–xVx)ON structures was
examined to check whether it was thermodynamically possible to incorporate
V at Ta sites into the monoclinic lattice of TaON. Figure 1 presents the DFT-optimized
lowest energy (Ta1–xVx)ON structures for x = 0.125, 0.25,
and 0.5, whereas Table 1 summarizes their computed reaction energy and cell parameters.

and O in red. The substitutional V species at Ta sites are displaced

The optimized cell constants of TaON reproduce very
well the experimental
data.21,24,34 Its structural
configuration consists of sharing irregular TaO3N4 polyhedra by edges. Each Ta is linked to three O and four N with
bond lengths of Ta–O located in the 2.03–2.15 Å
range and bond lengths of Ta–N in the 2.06–2.13 Å
range. With respect to the (Ta1–xVx)ON materials for x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5, the most stable configurations show dispersed
V species with V–V distances varying from 5.0 to 7.23 Å.
Upon geometry relaxation, the new V locations were very slightly displaced
as compared with the initial locations of Ta inside the lattice of
TaON. This gives very similar lattice constants as found in the monoclinic
phase of TaON (Table 1). Discussing now the energetics of the lowest energy structures
with x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5, we can clearly see
that their calculated reaction energies are negative with values of
−0.08, −0.23, and −0.57 eV, respectively (see Table 1). This result indicates
that these materials seem to be thermodynamically more stable than
TaON or VON. Other geometrical configurations for x = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5, with more separated V by shorter V–V
distances going from 3.22 to 3.95 Å, showed slightly less stability
by 0.06, 0.07, and 0.09 eV than the previous cases, respectively.

3.2 Bandgap Narrowing and Visible-Light Optical
Absorption Enhancement with Increasing V Concentration
Figure 2a displays the calculated
electronic structure using HSE06 for TaON and 3.0 eV as a bandgap
value was predicted, and this was reasonably close to the measured
one of 2.8 eV.24 The valence band edge
energy levels mainly consist of N 2p states with little implications
of Ta 5d and O 2p states. The conduction band edge energy levels consist
of unoccupied Ta 5d orbitals. For this semiconductor, the energy of
the bandgap involves direct optical transitions from N 2p6 to Ta 5d0 orbitals.

Figure 2 Electronic density of states of (Ta1–xVx)ON
materials with different
V concentrations obtained with HSE06: (a) x = 0,
(b) x = 0.125, (c) x = 0.25, and
(d) x = 0.5.

For (Ta1–xVx)ON, the HSE06-computed bandgaps are much narrower
than that
obtained for TaON (see Figure 2b–d). Bandgaps of 2.3 and 2.0 eV are obtained when
V concentration is increased to 12.5 and 25%, respectively (see Figure 2b,c). An additional
increase in the V concentration to 50% again reduces the bandgap energy
up to 1.6 eV, as displayed in Figure 2d. The electronic analyses show lower density of Ta
5d orbitals accompanied by higher V 3d density orbitals in the conduction
band while increasing the V concentration (Figure 2b–d). As a consequence, the conduction
band states located within a wide energy range of these compounds
are predominant by unoccupied V 3d orbitals (Figure 2b–d). As expected, in all cases, the
upper part of the valence band states is principally made by N 2p
orbitals similarly as obtained in TaON. Therefore, the lowest energy
bandgap energy of these materials originates from direct N 2p6–V 3d0 orbital excitations. The impact of
the spin–orbit interaction on the electronic structures of
these materials was also checked and very small bandgap energy reductions,
0.01 eV only, were found.

We have also investigated the light
absorption properties of the
considered (Ta1–xVx)ON materials by calculating their UV–visible
optical absorption coefficient in terms of incident photon wavelength.
For TaON, an absorption onset at around 400 nm was revealed from the
computed spectrum (Figure 3a). (Ta1–xVx)ON having 12.5, 25, and 50% V at Ta sites exhibits
completely different optical behavior showing the presence of new
intense visible-light absorption bands with extended onsets at around
540, 590, and 700 nm, respectively (Figure 3b–d). The main reason for the important
increase in the optical density with increasing V content is directly
linked to the increase in the density of V 3d states. The new optical
absorption bands appeared in Figure 3 originate from the electronic transitions from N 2p
orbitals located in the valence band to empty V 3d orbitals located
in the conduction band. By comparing our computed spectra of (Ta1–xVx)ON
materials with that obtained for Ta3N5, we can
clearly see that the absorption efficiencies of (Ta1–xVx)ON are quite higher
than that of Ta3N5 in the entire visible region.
These results clearly highlight that monoclinic (Ta1–xVx)ON could be a potential
solar-driven energy absorber. Note that our computed optical absorption
coefficient spectrum for Ta3N5 was found to
be in good agreement with the obtained experimental one.51 Recently, we have shown a particular trend showing
a linear upward shift of both valence and conduction band edge energy
levels of (Ta1–xNbx)ON materials with increasing Nb content.23 Here, we expect a very similar trend. However,
our main target was to find an adequate predicted bandgap energy of
the semiconductor photocatalyst greater than 1.23 eV and very close
to 2.0 eV for the overall water splitting under solar light irradiations
to absorb a large amount of photons in the visible region by respecting
the water-splitting limits and the required thermodynamic driving
forces of the photogenerated holes and photoexcited electrons. On
the basis of these conditions, we mainly focused, in what follows,
on the Ta0.75V0.25ON material with this optimal
composition to investigate the dielectric constant, charge-carrier
transport, and band edge energy positions with respect to water-splitting
limits. We systematically compared the computed results with those
obtained for Ta3N5.

3.3 Optical/Static
Dielectric Constant and Hole/Electron
Effective Mass Tensors of Ta0.75V0.25ON: Comparison
with Ta3N5
The calculated nonzero values
of the high-frequency and static dielectric constant tensors of the
Ta0.75V0.25ON crystal in the three principal
directions together with those obtained for Ta3N5 are reported in Table 2. For Ta0.75V0.25ON, we found ε0 values of 28.1, 41.7, and 28.0 in the three respective [100], [010],
and [001] principal directions with an averaged value of 32.6. As
the obtained value is quite higher than 10, this indicates that the
Ta0.75V0.25ON crystal has excellent dielectric
properties. Interestingly, the static dielectric constant is dominated
by the vibrational component (see Table 2 for more details), which may come from the
high electronegativity of nitrogen and oxygen leading to important
Born charges generated in this system. Our computed static dielectric
constant of Ta0.75V0.25ON is found to be close
to that obtained in the case of the perfect Ta3N5 crystal, 40.7, suggesting dielectric properties similar to those
of Ta3N5.

To evaluate the possibility
of the exciton to be dissociated to
free holes and electrons by considering the material Ta0.75V0.25ON, we have calculated the exciton binding energy
using the hydrogenic model. A low value of 4.7 meV was obtained for
Ta0.75V0.25ON, which is lower than the thermal
energy at 298 K, and hence, a facile separation of exciton to free
holes and electrons could be achieved using Ta0.75V0.25ON. Because our computed value of this material is very
close to 4.4 meV, as was obtained for Ta3N5,
the ability of the exciton to be dissociated to free charge carriers
using the Ta0.75V0.25ON material is expected
to be good and similar to that of Ta3N5.

With respect to the calculated hole and electron effective mass
tensors of Ta0.75V0.25ON and Ta3N5 crystals, high anisotropies are found in the obtained values
along the three crystallographic directions as shown in Table 3. The smallest hole effective
mass of Ta0.75V0.25ON is found to be in the
[001] direction with a value of 0.20m0. The lowest effective mass of electron of 0.38m0 was obtained in the [010] direction. As a result, the
highest mobility of holes could be in the [001] orientation, whereas
the highest electron mobility could be in the [010] direction. As
both effective masses are smaller than 0.5m0, good transport properties of charge carriers are expected in these
two particular crystal orientations. We stress here that the migration
of electrons and holes seems to be easy along these two particular
orientations; therefore, the separation of electrons and holes could
be achieved at this compound surface. In contrast, the effective masses
of holes in the [100] and [010] orientations and those of the electrons
in the [100] and [001] directions are quite large; therefore, the
transport properties of holes and electrons are expected to be poor
in these two directions. Interestingly, our lowest effective masses
computed for Ta0.75V0.25ON (mh* = 0.12m0; me* = 0.18m0) are found to be much lower
than those obtained for Ta3N5 (mh* = 0.84m0; me* = 0.62m0), yielding much better transport
properties than Ta3N5.

3.4 Redox Properties of Ta0.75V0.25ON: Comparison with Ta3N5
Using HSE06,
the computed electronic structure of the (001) slab
model of Ta0.75V0.25ON within 20 Å thickness
reproduced well the bulk bandgap energy of this compound. Values of
−1.25 and +0.75 eV were obtained for the valence and conduction
band edge energy levels, respectively. Then, the electrostatic potential
profile, calculated at the HSE06 level, and averaged over parallel
planes to the (001) surface, results in the vacuum having an energy
of 5.0 eV (see Figure 4b). Taking into account these values, the calculated energy level
of the conduction band edge relative to vacuum of Ta0.75V0.25ON using HSE06 is found to be 0.25 eV higher than
the H+/H2 potential, whereas the energy level
of the valence band edge is calculated to be 0.52 eV lower relative
to the O2/H2O potential (see Figure 5a). Due to the suitable band
positions relative to O2/H2O and H+/H2 levels, respectively, Ta0.75V0.25ON could be a promising candidate for the evolution of both hydrogen
and oxygen. Interestingly, our computed band positions of Ta0.75V0.25ON relative to water redox potentials are found to
be well positioned and better than those obtained for Ta3N5 that, on the basis of HSE06 calculations, was predicted
as a promising candidate only for hydrogen evolution, due to the unsuitable
computed valence band edge energy level relative to O2/H2O potential (Figure 5b).21,22 The positive impact of substituting
Ta by V on the photocatalytic properties of TaON is in line with previous
experimental reports on V-doped TiO2 and mesoporous silica,
in which remarkable visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity enhancement
upon V incorporation was observed.52,53

4 Conclusions
In the context of screening
possible materials for photocatalytic
water splitting, we have investigated the thermodynamic stability
as well as the redox and optoelectronic properties of (Ta1–xVx)ON solid solution
semiconducting compounds (with x = 0.125, 0.25, and
0.5) by means of calculations based on DFT (together with the perturbation
approach DFPT) using both GGA-PBE and screened Coulomb hybrid HSE06
functionals.

Our study predicted Ta0.75V0.25ON as a promising
photocatalyst for splitting of water driven by solar light, with an
adequate bandgap of 2.0 eV, high absorption efficiency, a static dielectric
constant greater than 10, smaller hole and electron effective masses
than 0.5m0 along the [001] and [010] crystallographic
directions respectively, binding energy of the exciton lower than
25 meV, and suitable energy levels of band edges for water-splitting
limits. The obtained solar energy absorption and redox features of
Ta0.75V0.25ON were clearly better than those
acquired for Ta3N5, which is the most common
semiconductor photocatalyst used in visible-light-driven water splitting.
