Aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplet
generation has significant
potential in biological and medical applications because of its excellent
biocompatibility. However, the ultralow interfacial tension of ATPS
makes droplet generation extremely challenging when compared with
the conventional water-in-oil (W/O) system. In this paper, we passively
produced ATPS droplets with a wide range of droplet size and high
production rate without the involvement of an oil phase and external
forces. For the first time, we reported important information of the
flow rate and capillary (Ca) number for passive,
oil-free ATPS droplet generation. It was found that the range of Ca numbers of the continuous phase under the jetting flow
regime is 0.3–1.7, as compared to less than 0.1 in the W/O
system, indicating the ultralow interfacial tension in ATPS. In addition,
we successfully generated ATPS droplets with a radius as small as
7 μm at the maximum frequency up to 300 Hz, which has not been
achieved in previous studies. The size and generation frequency of
ATPS droplets can be controlled independently by adjusting the inlet
pressures and corresponding flow rates. We found that the droplet
size is correlated with the pressure and flow rate ratios with the
power-law exponents of 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.

1 Introduction
The
high efficacy of microdroplets for chemical reaction, material
synthesis, drug delivery, and disease treatment has been proven in
several studies over the last few decades.1−9 In recent years, the water-in-oil (W/O) system because of its appropriate
physical properties has been mainly used to generate aqueous droplets
in an oil environment.1 Despite the remarkable
advantages, some important issues need to be considered when using
oil as the continuous phase in the manufacturing of aqueous droplets.
One of the critical challenges is the recovery of the aqueous sample
from the oil phase, which is very difficult and often requires expensive
and cumbersome postprocessing.10,11 Furthermore, the involvement
of oil would be detrimental to the viability of cells in biochemical
reactions, biomaterial syntheses, and cell or protein encapsulation
and always raises concerns about the toxicity of oil.10−13

To circumvent these challenges, aqueous two-phase system
(ATPS)
has been proposed to produce oil-free and nontoxic aqueous droplets.14 The biocompatible nature of ATPS makes it the
best candidate suited for the various biological applications.13 However, ATPS droplet generation and manipulation
are challenging and difficult when compared with the conventional
W/O system. This is attributed to the ultralow interfacial tension
of ATPS, often less than 0.1 mN/m. It should be noted that the interfacial
tension of the conventional W/O system ranges from 1 to 40 mN/m.15 The low interfacial tension in ATPS results
in either a long stream of the dispersed phase throughout the channel
without droplet breakup or extremely unstable nonuniform droplets.10,13,16 As a result, involvement of external
forces is always required to facilitate breakup of the stable dispersed
phase thread.16−20 However, these techniques are ineffective in costs and time and
involve additional requirements for chip fabrication and experimental
setup. In addition, the droplet generation frequency (or throughput)
in the active methods, which is of great importance for the scale-up
of droplet manufacturing in practical applications, is limited to
as high as 50 Hz because of its long response time.15

Recently, a passive liquid-filled pipette tip method
has been introduced
to generate ATPS droplets without the requirement of the external
perturbation.10,13,21 This system has successfully provided continuous passive generation
of the ATPS droplets because the interfacial tension force is comparable
with the inertial and viscous shear forces. One of the major
issues in the previous results is that the inlet flow conditions varied
because of the changes in the height of a fluid column in the pipette
tip as the fluid was kept injected and the total throughput was limited
to the amount of fluid stored in the pipette tip. In addition, no
studies of passive ATPS droplet generation reported the exact information
of capillary (Ca) number. This is because all previous
studies injected fluids using a pressure-controlled mechanism by the
pipette tips. Ca number is the most important dimensionless
number in microfluidic droplet generation used mainly for studying
the fundamental physics, identifying different flow regimes, calculating
droplet properties, and most importantly designing the droplet generators
with different channel geometries.1,10,22−25 Because of its significance, many studies with W/O
systems provided Ca number and it is typically in
the range of 10–3 to 1.25 Another issue is that the droplet generation frequency is limited
at 15 Hz, which is too low to manufacture droplets for actual biomedical
applications. To reach a higher frequency of droplet generation, inlet
hydrostatic pressures (or flow rates) should be further increased
than the current level. Zhou et al.15 passively
obtained high frequencies of ATPS droplet generation by using an additional
oil-chopper phase, but their method requires postprocessing for product
collection to separate the ATPS droplets from the oil.

In this
work, we used precise control of flow rates to produce
ATPS droplets without applying any external forces and employing an
oil phase. For the first time, we measured inlet flow rates of ATPS
during droplet generation, which was impossible in the previous passive
oil-free ATPS studies. The flow rate information was used to characterize
the droplet properties in terms of the dimensionless Ca number and droplet size. The pressure-/flow rate-controlled
passive method generated droplets as small as 7 μm in radius
at the generation frequency up to 300 Hz. In addition, we found that
the droplet size is correlated with the pressure and flow rate ratios
with the power-law exponents of 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. To our
knowledge, this is the first successful passive generation of oil-free
ATPS droplets with a wide range of sizes at high frequencies, which
are comparable with those in the W/O system.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Passive Generation of ATPS
Droplets by Rayleigh–Plateau
Instability
Droplet flow regimes generally consist of squeezing,
dripping, jetting, and stratified flow.1,22 Among them,
the jetting flow regime is preferred to obtain spherical droplets
with higher throughput. ATPS droplet generation under the jetting
flow regime occurs by thread breakup because of the Rayleigh–Plateau
(R–P) instability that explains why a falling liquid jet breaks
into tiny droplets. The R–P instability growth rate (ω)
is a function of the perturbation wavenumber (k),
interfacial tension (σ), viscosity (μ), size of the jet
(r0), and channel height (h), as shown in eq 1.
The interfacial tension of ATPS is typically in the range of 10–1 to 10–4 mN/m, indicating the ultralow
interfacial tension force in droplet generation when compared with
that in the W/O system.13 The ultralow
interfacial tension σ would induce a slow growth rate ω
along the jet as observed in eq 1.15,26 Consequently, it is expected that the droplet
breakup length and time are greater and the breakup rate is smaller
in ATPS than those in W/O systems. This makes either erratic droplet
breakup very far downstream or a thread that survives indefinitely
inside the channel without ever breaking up in ATPS.13,26,27 1  

Because the interfacial tension of
ATPS is much lower than that of the W/O system,  viscous shear
and inertial forces should be low to be comparable or less than the
interfacial tension force to enable droplet generation. It should
be noted that Ca number is the ratio between viscous shear
force and interfacial tension force. In other words, the flow velocity
of the ATPS should be close to the viscocapillary velocity (Ca number should be less than or about 1; Ca = μv/σ, where μ is the viscosity, v is the flow velocity, and σ is the interfacial tension).15 Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the ultralow
flow rates to break up the dispersed jet passively and generate spherical
ATPS droplets. Conventional syringe pump-based passive methods that
the majority of W/O systems employed are unable to produce ATPS droplets
because the required flow rate is near the lower limit of the flow
rate of these commercial pumps. It should be noted that many syringe
pumps are unstable at their lower limit of the flow rate.13

To overcome this issue, as aforementioned,
the pipette tip-based
passive droplet generation has been attempted at lower flow rates
than that in syringe pumps. One limitation of this method is its inconsistent
inlet pressure in given settings because of the change in the height
of a fluid column and inherent low frequency because of the fluid
injection at too low flow rate. To generate droplets with uniform
properties (size and composition), it is necessary to maintain consistent
fluid injection at constant flow rates. In addition, to increase generation
frequencies, the fluids should be introduced at higher pressure and
flow rates than the previous pipette tip ATPS droplet generation.10,13 In this study, a precise pressure-driven flow injection scheme was
utilized to enable generation of rapid, stable, and pulseless droplets
with flow rates near the lower limit of commercial syringe pumps but
higher flow rates than the pipette tip method. The experimental setup
consists of a pressure controller, fluid reservoirs, flow units, and
a microfluidic chip (see Experimental Section). Inlet pressure of the dispersed phase (PDEX) ranging from 7 to 15 kPa and inlet pressure of the continuous
phase (PPEG) dependent on PDEX varying between 10 and 32 kPa were introduced at constant
rates to generate uniform ATPS droplets. It should be noted that the
operating pressure in the pipette tip method was close to 1 kPa.10,13 At fixed PDEX, the maximum and
minimum values of PPEG for droplet generation
were monitored. For example, at PDEX =
15 kPa, the range of PPEG resulting in
droplet generation is 23–32 kPa. PPEG higher than 32 kPa and less than 23 kPa leads to the backflow of
dextran (DEX) and the stratified flow of DEX, respectively. At this
range of inlet pressure of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and DEX, the
resultant flow regime is the jetting in which the generated droplets
are smaller with higher frequencies than the dripping regime.

2.2 Ca Number and Flow Rate Ratio
in ATPS
Information about flow conditions and relevant dimensionless
numbers is important to study the fundamental physics and hydrodynamic
mechanisms of ATPS droplet generation.1 In addition, the dimensionless geometry-independent results of the
droplet properties are important in application of the present method
in various geometries.10Ca number, expressed as the viscous shear force over the interfacial
tension force between two phases,28 is
the most important parameter in droplet microfluidics by which we
can compare the results of this study with different systems of droplet
generation such as W/O systems in different configurations.22 Hydrostatic pressure-driven injection of fluids
was used in all of the previous studies of passive, oil-free ATPS
droplet generation. The presence of the two-phase flow (i.e., both
continuous and dispersed phases) in the main channel of length L makes it impossible to use the relationship between the
pressure drop and the flow rate of single-phase flow .29 This results
in no information about the flow rate of both continuous and dispersed
phases and relevant Ca number.

Here, we present
our test results in terms of the flow rate and Ca number in passive, oil-free ATPS droplet generation (Table 1). In conventional W/O systems,
because the dispersed and continuous phases were mostly controlled
by commercial syringe pumps at constant flow rates, the dimensionless Ca number could be calculated at the typical range of 10–3 to 1. On the other hand, none of passive and oil-free
ATPS studies except the current study have provided the Ca number because the inlet flow rates (or velocity) were unknown.
In general, the interfacial tension of ATPS is several orders of magnitude
smaller than that of W/O systems, and this is why the Ca number in the current study is in the relatively large magnitude
when compared with those in W/O systems.

As in W/O systems, the relationship
between flow conditions and
geometries, such as droplet size versus flow rate ratio and Ca number was investigated.34,35,37−39Figure 1a shows variations in the flow rate ratio
versus the pressure ratio. As can be seen, the flow rate ratio has
a power-law dependence on the pressure ratio in a log–log graph, QDEX/QPEG = 0.3(PDEX/PPEG)3.8. The power and coefficient depend on the hydraulic resistance in
the flow path, which is a function of the channel size and viscosity.4Figure 1b shows variations of dimensionless droplet size (droplet
diameter, D) versus the flow rate ratio. As is clear
from the figure, increasing the flow rate ratio results in an increase
in the droplet size. This is in line with the fact that increasing QDEX and decreasing QPEG leads to bigger droplet generation. D/W varies between 0.15 and 0.28 when the flow rate ratio linearly increases
from approximately 0.002 to 0.056. This linear relationship has also
been observed by Garstecki et al.40

Figure 1 (a) Variations
of the flow rate ratio as a function of the pressure
ratio and (b) dimensionless droplet size vs the flow rate ratio.

Figure 2 presents
the droplet size and CaDEX in terms of CaPEG. Figure 2a provides unique contributions of viscous shear
and interfacial tension forces to droplet generation as the Ca number is directly related to these two forces. It should
be noted that the Ca number provides a unique venue
to determine the droplet properties in the various systems. The range
of CaPEG in our experiments is 0.3–1.7
(Ca ≈ O(1)), indicating that the ultralow
interfacial tension of the system and the Ca number
in the current study are greater than those in the conventional W/O
systems (Table 1).
This implies that the effect of the viscous shear force exerted
by the PEG phase is comparable to the interfacial tension force. We
observed that the dripping flow regime in the ATPS droplet generation
does not occur in this range of Ca numbers, but rather,
this range of Ca numbers is favorable for the jetting
flow regime. The unique ultralow interfacial tension in ATPS makes
it impossible to generate droplets close to the junction at even low
flow velocity as CaPEG is still around
1, which should be in the jetting regime (Table 1). In such conditions with extremely low
velocity, that is, low inlet pressure and low inlet flow rate of PEG,
bigger droplets at low frequencies are generated under the dripping
flow regime, which is not a favorable condition for droplet generation.10 On the other hand, to achieve the high frequencies
of droplet generation, an increase in CaPEG number at fixed PDEX makes droplet size
decrease because of the increase in the velocity of the PEG phase
and resultant enhanced viscous shear force, as shown in Figure 2b. From these figures,
it is observed that the minimum value of Ca number
in the jetting flow regime is about 0.2, as found in the literature,41 whereas the maximum Ca number
is close to 1.7. It should be emphasized that the range of Ca numbers in the jetting flow regime in ATPS is introduced
in the current study (Table 1).

2.3 Droplet
Generation Frequency and Droplet Size
Higher throughput with
superior size controllability, leading to
higher manufacturing efficiency and significant savings of chemicals
and time, is an important need for many large-scale applications. Table 2 shows a comparison
of the droplet size and resultant generation frequency in various
ATPS droplet generation schemes. In terms of the droplet size, the
current study provides much smaller droplets when compared with those
in active methods while compatible with passive methods. The droplet
size was conveniently controlled by changing the inlet flow rates
of two phases. On the other hand, the generation frequency was significantly
improved compared with the previous reports in ATPS droplet generation.

Figure 3 shows the
droplet frequency with respect to PPEG at different PDEX. In this figure, the
droplet generation frequency increases with increasing PPEG at all PDEX. The highest
droplet frequency is found at ∼300 Hz at PDEX = 11 kPa and PPEG = 30
kPa, which has not been achieved in all previous ATPS droplet generation
(Table 1) (see Supporting
Information Video S2). High generation
frequency of ATPS droplet generation is essential for laboratory or
clinical settings such as biological and chemical assays in droplets
and high throughput manipulation, analysis, sorting, and encapsulation
of cells.42−44 To increase the droplet generation frequency further, PPEG should be increased in theory. However,
considering the dimensions of the microchannel in our experimental
setup, further increasing of PPEG results
in a very thin stream of DEX and unstable tiny droplets.

Figure 3 Variations
of the droplet frequency as a function of PPEG at different PDEX.

Small aqueous droplets in picoliter to nanoliter are particularly
useful for cell research, drug delivery, organic particle synthesis,
and microreactors.47 In droplet microfluidics,
it has been known that the drop size typically depends on the channel
geometry and input pressures.10 The channel
geometry and input pressures directly alter the dispersed and continuous
phase flow rates, making peculiar flow regimes with various droplet
sizes. In our study, spherical droplets in the range of 7–14
μm in radius were generated mainly by the R–P instability
in the jetting flow regime (see Supporting Information Videos S1 and S2).

Figure 4a shows
the variations of droplet size at different PPEG and PDEX. It shows that the
droplet size increases by increasing PDEX at fixed PPEG. This result is well aligned
with our observation that the breakup point of the liquid jet moves
from the junction to downstream, causing a long DEX stream. In other
words, an increase in PDEX causes a higher
inertial force of the dispersed phase than the interfacial tension
force resulting in larger droplets. Because of the low interfacial
tension force, droplets are unable to maintain their perfect spherical
shape.26

Figure 4 (a) Variations of droplet size as a function
of PPEG at different PDEX and
(b) dimensionless droplet size vs the pressure ratio.

On the other hand, as PPEG increases
at fixed PDEX, the location of droplet
pinching-off moves closer to the junction resulting in smaller droplets.
The viscous shear force exerted on the interface would be increased
by the higher flow rate of the continuous phase, which makes a stronger
elongation effect acting on the DEX thread-thinning process and the
breakup of the DEX phase into smaller droplets.48 The smallest droplet size in our study is 14 μm in
diameter at PPEG = 30 kPa and PDEX = 11 kPa (Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows the dimensionless droplet size versus the inlet
pressure ratio. The size of formed droplets can be scaled with the
pressure ratio (PDEX/PPEG = 0.37–0.71) of both phases as a power-law
relationship (D/W = 0.4(PDEX/PPEG)0.8, Figure 4b inset).
The droplet size as a function of flow rate ratio shows fewer variations
than the pressure ratio (in log–log coordinates). From Figures 4b and 1b, it can be seen that the increase in droplet size is greater
by increasing the pressure ratio compared with the flow rate ratio.37

3 Conclusions
Understanding
the fundamental mechanisms of droplet generation
in all aqueous phases has important implication, particularly in biomedical
research. In this paper, we investigated flow characteristics and
resultant droplet properties during droplet formation in a flow-focusing
geometry in a passive ATPS system without the involvement of an oil
phase and external forces. In contrast to all previous passive ATPS
studies, we provided Ca number in the range of 0.3–1.7
based on flow rates maintained constant. This range of Ca number in ATPS is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than the
conventional oil–water systems, indicating that ATPS generates
droplets at the ultralow value of interfacial tension. The relatively
high range of Ca number requires unique inlet flow
conditions where flow rates should be set in near the lower limit
of commercial syringe pumps and the upper limit of the pipette tip
method. The exclusive flow regimes generate ATPS droplets with different
sizes, 7–14 μm in radius, and frequencies up to 300 Hz,
impossible previously in both passive and active methods for ATPS
droplet formation. The size and frequency were significantly improved
when compared with those in the previous studies. Particularly, generation
of ATPS droplets in the passive method without the involvement of
an oil phase has been limited to 15 Hz. The experimental results showed
that the droplet size can be characterized by a power law of both
pressure and flow rate ratios with different exponents of 0.8 and
0.2, respectively.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Experimental Setup
A schematic of
the experimental setup including a flow-focusing microfluidic chip
and a flow control system is shown in Figure 5. The flow-focusing geometry consists of
two inlet and one outlet ports. The width (W) of
the downstream and PEG channels is 100 μm, whereas the width
of the DEX channel is 50 μm. The height (h)
of all of these channels is 75 μm. A high-precision microfluidic
pressure control system, MFCS-EZ (Fluigent, Inc., USA), with a flow
unit platform including a flow-board and two in-line flow units was
used. The flow units are two high-precision individual flow sensors
for measuring the flow rate: M model (up to 80 μL/min with a
lowest detectable flow rate increment of 0.06 μL/min) and S
model (up to 7 μL/min with a lowest detectable flow rate increment
of 0.01 μL/min) were used for the PEG and DEX phases, respectively.
As shown in Figure 5, the outlet of the pressure controller was connected to fluid reservoirs
of PEG and DEX to inject controlled pressurized air. The pressurized
air drives the fluid and then the fluid flows through the outlet
of the reservoirs. After passing through flow units, the fluid enters
the chip creating droplets. Multiple calibration processes were performed
for accurate flow rate measurements. An inverted microscope (IX73,
Olympus Corp., Japan) with a 10× objective lens and high-speed
camera (INFINITY3-3UR, Lumenera Corp., Canada) was used to capture
images of ATPS droplets. For high-speed imaging, the camera operated
at 50–80 fps with an exposure time of 1.0 ms. ImageJ software
was used for image processing such as droplet size measurements.

Figure 5 Experimental
setup and schematic of a microfluidic chip.

4.2 Microfluidic Chip
The microfluidic
chip was fabricated using standard soft lithography and photolithography
techniques with PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane). The channel geometry
was created using computer-aided design (CAD) software (AutoCAD 2016,
Autodesk, Inc., USA). To form a patterned photomask, the CAD designs
were printed onto a transparency sheet (25 400 dpi, CAD/ART
Services Inc., USA). Spin coating was used to distribute a thin layer
of KMPR 1025 photoresist (MicroChem, USA) to a 4 in. silicon wafer
(UniversityWafer, Inc., USA). After exposure to UV light through the
patterned photomask, the wafer was chemically developed to form the
channel geometries. A 10:1 ratio mixture of PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow
Corning, USA) resin to curing agent was poured onto the silicon wafer.
The wafer was allowed to cure in an oven for 1 h before removal of
the PDMS layer. Inlet and outlet holes were made using a 1.0 mm diameter
biopsy punch (Integra Miltex, Inc., Germany). Finally, the PDMS layer
and a glass microscope slide (25 × 75 × 1.0 mm,
Fisher Scientific, USA) were permanently bonded through an oxygen
plasma treatment (Harrick Plasma, USA).

4.3 Chemicals
To prepare the ATPS solution,
two solutions of 10% (w/v) PEG (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 16% (w/v)
DEX (Alfa Aesar, USA) were formulated by dissolving PEG and DEX separately
in deionized water. The two solutions were then thoroughly mixed in
a beaker using a magnetic stirrer (Isotemp stirring hotplate, Fisher
Scientific). The solution was left for a minimum of 24 h of inactivity
while phase-separation occurred, forming upper PEG-rich and lower
DEX-rich phases. After the solution reached equilibrium, we partitioned
the two phases with syringes into separate 50 mL conical centrifuge
tubes (Corning Falcon centrifuge tubes, Fisher Scientific). Viscosity
values are μPEG = 17.0 mPa·s and μDEX = 71.9 mPa·s for the PEG and DEX phases, respectively.13 The interfacial tension of the ATPS solution
is 0.103 ± 0.006 mN/m, and the densities of the PEG and DEX phases
are ρPEG = 1013 kg/m3 and ρDEX = 1067 kg/m3, respectively.49
