This article presents the catalysis investigation of
octanethiolate-capped
palladium nanoparticles (C8 PdNP) and phenylethanethiolate-capped
palladium nanoparticles (PhC2 PdNP) for chemoselective catalytic hydrogenation
reactions of styrene derivatives in the presence of other reducible
functionalities. The results show that the C8 PdNP is highly active
under mild reaction conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure)
and selective for hydrogenating monosubstituted alkene groups without
reducing other reactive functional groups such as nitro, halo, carbonyls,
and so forth. In comparison, the noncovalent interactions between
surface phenyl ligands and aromatic substrates are found to hinder
the hydrogenation activity of PhC2 PdNP.

Introduction
Colloidal metal nanoparticle catalysts
are considered semiheterogeneous
because of their homogeneous kinetic traits and heterotopic surface
properties. Furthermore, their high surface energy makes colloidal
metal nanoparticles very useful catalytic systems that operate with
high activity under mild conditions. Due to these advantages over
the traditional homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, colloidal
metal nanoparticles with controlled activity have recently attracted
increased research interests for selective organic reactions.1−5

Palladium catalysts have been popularly used for hydrogenation,
exceeding the reputation of other metal catalysts such as platinum
and rhodium.6−20 One of the reasons for that is their lower metal hydrogen bonding
energy compared to those of both Pt and Rh.6 The classical palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is well known for efficient
hydrogenation of organic compounds possessing various reducible functionalities.21 However, in general, selective hydrogenation
of Pd/C for several highly reactive functionalities has been difficult
because of its uncontrollably strong catalytic activity.

Chemoselective
hydrogenation of alkene has been studied for many
decades using various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts especially
for the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries.22−24 For example, common substrates such as unsaturated alkenes often
possess other reducible functionalities such as nitro, halo, carbonyl,
and so forth. Because the property of organic compounds changes dramatically
depending on the functional groups in the molecule, it is crucial
to have catalysts with high chemoselectivity for different functional
groups. The activity of palladium catalysts could be modulated by
using various support systems,21,25 but the present systems
still pose problems especially for highly reactive functional groups.
In addition, the development of catalysts for chemoselective hydrogenation
that operates in mild reaction conditions is extremely desirable.

There have been several studies on chemoselective hydrogenation
utilizing supported palladium catalysts including those supported
by macromolecules. The chemoselectivity and activity of the supported
Pd catalysts depend on the structure and functional groups of the
supports, the type of ligands (or adsorbents), and the reaction environments
such as solvents, temperature, and pressure.25 These Pd-based catalysts supported on solid materials, such as fibroin
(Fib), polyethyleneimine (PEI), boron nitride (BN), molecular sieves
(MS), chelate resin (Pd/CR11), ceramic, and spherically shaped activated
carbon (Pd/SC), have been intensely reviewed by others.21,25 For example, Pd/Fib could selectivity hydrogenate alkene, alkyne,
azide, and nitro functionalities in the presence of other readily
reducible functionalities, such as benzyl esters and aryl halides.
Furthermore, both Pd/MS and Pd/BN possessed similar catalytic activity,
selectively hydrogenating alkynes, alkenes, and azides to the corresponding
alkanes and amines without reducing other functionalities within the
substrates. The Pd/CR11 catalyst exhibited a high activity for selective
hydrogenation of a variety of reducible functionalities, such as alkyne,
alkene, azide, nitro, benzyl ester, and aryl benzyl ether, in the
presence of benzylic or allylic alcohol, indicating the moderated
deactivation of the catalytic activity that is based on the chelation
effect of the iminodiacetate moiety on CR11 to palladium metal. The
Pd/SC catalyst exhibited chemoselectivity not only for alkyne, alkene,
azide, and nitro functionalities but also for the alkyl TBS ether
functionality in the presence of other functional groups.

Our
research group has shown that PdNPs synthesized using S-alkylthiosulfate ligands demonstrate superior catalytic
activity for the isomerization of terminal alkenes and the selective
hydrogenation of dienes to alkenes.18,26 The results
indicated that the partial poisoning of PdNPs by the thiolate ligands
allows a superior control over the activity of colloidal PdNP catalysts.
In this paper, the partial poisoning of PdNP catalysts by alkanethiolate
ligands is investigated for chemoselective hydrogenation of alkene
in the presence of various reactive functional groups under mild reaction
conditions. Several other methods including Wilkinson’s catalyst
have shown to be effective for chemoselective hydrogenation in the
presence of reactive functional groups.21,25,27−30 However, the semiheterogeneous characteristics of
PdNPs provide additional benefits including facile separation of PdNPs
in their powder form that leads to simple isolation of pure products
and high recyclability. These results are compared to other catalysts
based on kinetic studies and selectivity outcomes.

Results and Discussion
Chemoselective Hydrogenation by Octanethiolate-Capped Pd Nanoparticles
The previous work from our group showed that the catalytic hydrogenation
of styrene to ethylbenzene is completed in less than 24 h at room
temperature and under atmospheric H2 pressure by utilizing
5 mol % C8 PdNP.26 No other product involving
hydrogenation of benzene group is detected, indicating a good hydrogenation
selectivity for alkene group over aromatic functionality. Since styrene
hydrogenation to ethylbenzene is an important process as ethylbenzene
is a key compound in the aromatics industry,31,32 the high selectivity of C8 PdNP catalysts that operate under mild
reaction conditions is already potentially valuable. The previous
studies confirmed the contribution of the p orbitals and planar geometry
of the benzene ring in aiding the formation of the di-σ-bonded
Pd-alkyl intermediate that is necessary for the hydrogenation process.26,33,34 To further investigate alkanethiolate-capped
PdNP as chemoselective hydrogenation catalysts, m-nitrostyrene was first selected as a control system (Scheme 1). Because the nitro moiety
is strongly electron-withdrawing and in general very reactive to Pd
catalysts under a hydrogen environment, it was necessary to determine
the optimized conditions that provide an efficient hydrogenation activity
for less activated alkenes while maintaining high chemoselectivity
for hydrogenation of alkene over the nitro group.

Scheme 1 Reaction Scheme for
Catalytic Hydrogenation of m-Nitrostyrene Using C8
PdNP
The results in Table 1 show that the C8 PdNP catalyst was most
effective in the original
reaction condition (entry 1: room temperature, 1 atm H2, 5 mol % PdNP, and CDCl3 solvent) with the complete reduction
of alkene to alkane without hydrogenating the nitro functional group.
The complete hydrogenation of alkene group required 24 h of reaction
under this standard condition. However, decreasing the loading of
PdNP to 2.5 and 1 mol % resulted in incomplete hydrogenations of alkene
with 97 and 76% conversions, respectively, after 24 h (entries 2 and
3). When the concentration of reactants was decreased by ∼67%,
the hydrogenation of m-nitrostyrene to 1-ethyl-3-nitrobenzene
dropped noticeably from 97 to 8% indicating the importance of kinetic
collisions (entry 4). The use of polar solvents such as methanol,
acetone, and DMSO had negative influence on the catalytic activity
of C8 PdNP due to the heterogeneous nature of catalyst conditions
(entries 5–7). In comparison, Pd/C was able to hydrogenate
both alkene and nitro functional groups under the same mild reaction
condition exhibiting its highly active but less selective catalysis
nature.

b The reaction
condition was heterogeneous.

c The major product of hydrogenation
reaction by Pd/C was 3-amino-1-ethylbenzene.

Encouraged by the high selectivity of C8 PdNP for
hydrogenation
of alkene in the presence of nitro group, we further explored the
substrate scope of this catalytic system (Table 2). The possible synergistic effect between
the heteroatoms of the nitro group and PdNP was investigated using trans-β-nitrostyrene, ethyl trans-4-nitrocinnamate, and 1-nitrocyclohex-1-ene (entries 1–3,
respectively). None of these alkenes were reactive toward hydrogenation,
and quantitative amounts of starting materials were recovered in all
three cases. The results indicated that disubstituted and trisubstituted
alkene hydrogenation are challenging for these thiolate-capped PdNP
catalysts. We propose that the presence of alkanethiolate ligands
sterically hinders the formation of the di-σ bonded intermediate
needed for the direct hydrogenation of multisubstituted alkenes.

Alkenes with Nitro Group by C8 PdNPab
a Reaction conditions: 50 mL round-bottom
flask, substrate (0.5 mmol), C8 PdNP (2.5 mol %), CDCl3 (2.5 mL), and 24 h.

b Hydrogenation
of ethyl trans-4-nitrocinnamate using Pd/C at the
same condition resulted in the
reduction of both C=C and NO2 groups.

With the activity and selectivity of C8 PdNP that
can be applied
to the hydrogenation of monosubstituted alkene, the hydrogenation
of various styrene derivatives with other functional groups such as
trifluoromethyl, aldehyde, bromo, fluoro, methyl, acetyloxy, and amino
groups was investigated (Table 3). The catalytic reactions of alkenes with various reducible
functionalities using C8 PdNP resulted in the desirable reduction
of C=C bond in high yields with remarkable selectivity. As
shown in the result of control experiment using m-nitrostyrene (entry 2), the catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrostyrene (entry 3) exhibited the same result, with the complete
reduction of alkene to alkane but without the reduction of nitro group.
Thus, the position of the functionalities on the benzene ring does
not affect the activity and selectivity of the C8 PdNP catalyst for
styrene hydrogenation. Moreover, the hydrogenation of another substituent
using C8 PdNP was not affected by the presence of a strongly electron-withdrawing
group, −CF3 (entry 4). The catalytic reactions of
challenging substrates that have reducible carbonyl functional groups
such as aldehyde and acetyloxy substituents also resulted in highly
chemoselective hydrogenation of alkene group (entries 5 and 6). Three halogenated styrene substrates, p-fluorostyrene, m-chlorostyrene, and p-bromostyrene, were selectively hydrogenated to the corresponding
1-ethyl-4-fluorobenzene, 1-chloro-3-ethylbenzene, and 1-bromo-4-ethylbenzene,
respectively, in high yields without any reductive dehalogenation
(entries 7–9). Figure S1 demonstrates
the kinetic studies of p-fluorostyrene to 1-ethyl-4-fluorobenzene
that is monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy to obtain a clearer
image of chemoselective hydrogenation reaction over time. Moreover,
other substituents with strong electron-donating property such as
−OCH3 and −NH2 or weakly electron-donating
alkyl substituents such as CH3 (entries 10–12) are
also fully hydrogenated without any notable change in the activity
of the C8 PdNP catalyst. Hence, the presence of electron-withdrawing
and election-donating groups in the styrene substrates does not have
any impact on the hydrogenation activity of C8 PdNP. The hydrogenation
of phenylacetylene (entry 13) produced a full hydrogenation product
in high yield, indicating the overall high activity of C8 PdNP for
terminal alkynes. In summary, the C8 PdNP catalyst exhibited high
activity toward unsaturated C=C bonds but no reduction of NO2 group and other less reactive functional groups including
carbonyl and halogens was observed. The presence of strongly electron-withdrawing
(−NO2, −CF3) or electron-donating
group (−OCH3, −NH2) had no impact
on the catalytic hydrogenation of styrene derivatives by C8 PdNP.
The chart in Figure 1 summarizes the chemoselectivity of C8 PdNP and other Pd-based catalysts
for hydrogenation of various functional groups.

The selectivity of alkene hydrogenation in the presence
of NO2 group is relatively challenging for other supported
metal
or metal nanoparticle catalysts as they reduce it to the corresponding
NH2. In comparison, our C8 PdNP catalyst exhibits an excellent
chemoselectivity for alkene hydrogenation that functions under a mild
reaction condition. Only a handful of Pd-based catalysts have shown
comparable catalytic activity and selectivity without reducing the
nitro group. The conversion yields and selectivities in addition to
the reaction conditions for the hydrogenation of m-nitrostyrene with other Pd-based catalysts are compared with those
of C8 PdNP in Table 4. The layered double hydroxide-supported nanopalladium (LDH-Pd0)
catalyst was reported for producing a mixture of products with a low
selectivity for 3-ethyl-1-nitrobenzene.35 Pd nanoparticles supported on fibrous silica nanospheres KCC-1-NH2 could be used for the transfer hydrogenation of alkene with
the use of HCOOH as a source of hydrogen.36 However, this catalyst reduced both functionalities of 3-nitrostyrene
with 45% conversion yield to 3-ethylaniline. When 3 equiv of formic
acid was employed under the same reaction condition, the formation
of 3-ethylaniline was observed in higher yield. Thus, both supported
Pd catalysts are considered more active but less selective than C8
PdNP for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. Other supported Pd catalysts
were reported for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene. Pd/MS5A exhibited
a fine selectivity for the hydrogenation of alkene in the presence
of nitro group in a mild reaction condition comparable to ours.37 Yet, the catalyst was not able to selectively
hydrogenate the terminal alkene when used for the hydrogenation of
styrene derivatives with more electron-donating substituents on the
aromatic ring, which limits the utility of the catalyst (vide infra).
Palladium nanoparticles immobilized on nitrogen-enriched porous carbon
(Pd/NPC) demonstrated a high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation
of alkene with HCOOH as the hydrogen donor, but the catalyst achieved
the reduction of both C=C and NO2.38

Transition-metal complexes were also reported for
hydrogenation
of styrene derivatives. Potassium bis(η4-anthracene) cobaltate showed a good activity in catalytic hydrogenation
reaction with unbiased styrene, but the reaction proceeded much poorer
with styrene derivatives with an electron-donating group such as acetoxy.39 Furthermore, an immobilized rhodium complexe
on silica was used for catalytic hydrogenation of 4-bromostyrene.40 The catalyst completed the hydrogenation of
4-bromostyrene under mild conditions, but the complete conversion
required 50 h, which are about double the reaction time needed for
C8 PdNP. The 0.5% Pd/MS5A catalyzed the hydrogenation of 4-bromostyrene,
affording a 71:29 mixture of 4-bromostyrene and 4-bromoethylbenzene.37

Iron-catalyzed hydrogenation of styrene
derivatives was reported
with an FeCl3–LiAlH4 catalyst.41 Although the reaction was operated under a high-pressure
condition (10 atm H2), the hydrogenation of 4-fluorostyrene
to 1-ethyl-4-fluorobenzene was limited to 77% conversion. The biowaste-derived
cobalt chitosan catalysts used for the hydrogenation of C=C
in 4-fluorostyrene yielded 81% of 1-ethyl-4-fluorobenzene in water
but required elevated temperature and high H2 pressure.42 Copper nanoparticles supported on diamond nanoparticle
annealed with hydrogen (Cu/DH) were investigated for the hydrogenation
of 4-methoxystyrene.43 The catalyst selectively
hydrogenated the alkene group, but the presence of a strong electron-donating
substituent caused the reaction to require 30 h to reach 60% conversion.
Iron-based homogeneous catalysts bearing a bis(phosphino)amine ligand
used for the hydrogenation of 4-methoxystyrene required a much longer
reaction time of 168 h to reach full conversion even at a higher operating
temperature.44 All these comparisons clearly
demonstrate the high activity and selectivity of C8 PdNP for the chemoselective
hydrogenation of styrene derivatives with various reactive functional
groups including highly electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
groups.

The stability and recyclability of C8 PdNP were examined
in the
previous work from our group using the same reaction condition that
catalyzed the hydrogenation of 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,4-diene.18 The C8 PdNP catalyst was precipitated and separated
from the reaction mixture and then dried without any solvent before
being recycled for more catalysis reactions. The results showed that
even after seven cycles, the activity and selectivity were maintained
at almost same levels. Thus, it is noteworthy to mention that the
C8 PdNP catalyst can be reused several times without the significant
loss of both its activity and selectivity.

PhC2 PdNP versus C8 PdNP
We have also recently developed
and worked on another catalyst, which is phenylethanethiolate-capped
Pd nanoparticles (PhC2 PdNP).33 The PhC2
PdNP has been synthesized with the same thiosulfate protocol that
was described earlier and found to have similar average particles
size with C8 PdNP. The average size and the surface ligand density
of PhC2 PdNP are 1.7 ± 0.8 nm and 0.32 ligand/surface atom, respectively.
In comparison, C8 PdNP has an average core size of 2.3 ± 0.9
nm and a ligand density of 0.35 (see the Supporting Information). The ligand of PhC2 PdNP is terminated with a
phenyl group, and with two methylene carbons, the ligand has a total
of eight carbons, which is the same number of carbons for C8 PdNP.
PhC2 PdNP has been examined for the selective hydrogenation of various
styrene derivatives under the same reaction condition used for C8
PdNP (Table 5). The
results indicated that the PhC2 PdNP exhibits the same chemoselectivity
for the C=C group in styrene derivatives as that of C8 PdNP
but with much lower catalytic activity for all substrates examined
here.

Derivatives Using PhC2 PdNPab
a Reaction conditions: 5 mol % PhC2
PdNP, 0.5 mmol substrates, room temperature, 3 mL of CDCl3 solvent, and 1 atm H2 for 24 h.

b No hydrogenation of other reducible
functional groups besides the C=C group was observed.

Kinetic studies have been conducted for two styrene
substrates
with different functional groups for both C8 and PhC2 PdNPs. One of
the substrates that was chosen for this study is 4-methoxystyrene.
As shown in Figure 2a, the two catalysts show clear differences in the initial kinetic
activity. After the first hour of the reaction, C8 PdNP produced 56%
of the product while PhC2 PdNP produced only 13%. After 24 h, both
catalysts achieved the reduction of C=C without reducing the
methoxy group. However, the hydrogenation of alkene by PhC2 PdNP resulted
in less than 50% conversion and reached a plateau after 6 to 24 h
reactions. Another example of the kinetic study was with 4-bromostyrene
(Figure 2b). After
1 h, C8 PdNP showed significantly higher yield at nearly 30% whereas
PhC2 PdNP displayed much lower yield. The final results after 24 h
reaction were quite similar for both PdNP to those of 4-methoxystyrene.
These kinetic studies clearly demonstrated that the catalytic reactions
of PhC2 PdNP are kinetically much slower than those of C8 PdNP and
reach an equilibrium at ∼50% conversion.

and (b) 4-bromostyrene.

Mechanistic Interpretations of the C8 PdNP and PhC2 PdNP Activities
The mechanistic interpretations for different activities of C8
PdNP and PhC2 PdNP are outlined in Figure 3. The presence of aromatic group in the styrene
substrates providing the overlapping p orbitals on the surface of
C8 PdNP is previously found to be a reason for the increases in the
formation of the di-σ-bonded Pd alkyl intermediate that results
in facile hydrogenation (Figure 3a).26 On the other hand,
the catalytic reaction of styrene derivatives with PhC2 PdNP resulted
in lower yields for the hydrogenation product. It is proposed that
the phenyl group that is present in the surface ligand interferes
with the contribution of phenyl group in the substrate (Figure 3b). The noncovalent interaction
between surface ligands and substrates has been shown to similarly
affect the catalytic selectivity of PdNP.33 In specific, for our catalytic system using PhC2 PdNP, the π–π
interaction of the aromatic groups between ligand and substrate would
reduce the strong interaction of the substrate with the Pd surface.
This prevents the essential contribution of phenyl group in the substrate
to form a di-σ-bonded Pd-alkyl intermediate on the catalyst
surface. Therefore, the weaker adsorption of styrene on the Pd nanoparticle
surface was directly translated to the slower catalytic hydrogenation
by PhC2 PdNP and the equilibrium between the substrate and Pd-alkyl
intermediate. Based on the previously reported catalytic activity
of PdNP generated from 2-cyclohexyl-1-ethylthiosulfate (CyC2 PdNP)
that was similar to that of C8 PdNP,33 the
presence of a large phenyl group, which is smaller than the cyclohexyl
group, does not seem to cause any significant steric problem on the
nanoparticle surface. Hence, different catalytic activities of PhC2
PdNP should mostly arise from the influence of aromatic π–π
interactions between surface ligands and substrates.

Conclusions
Octanethiolate-capped palladium nanoparticles
with an average core
size of 2.3 nm were used for chemoselective catalytic hydrogenation
of various styrene derivatives at room temperature and under atmospheric
pressure. This colloidal nanocatalyst exhibited outstanding activity
and selectivity for hydrogenating the monosubstituted alkene group
to the corresponding alkane in the presence of other reducible functional
groups under mild reaction conditions. Various reactive functionalities
such as aldehyde, nitro, chloro, bromo, acetoxy, and multisubstituted
alkene groups were not reduced by palladium nanoparticles. Furthermore,
phenyl-terminated ligand-capped palladium nanoparticles exhibited
a decreased catalytic activity for styrene hydrogenation. The influence
of ligand–substrate noncovalent interactions on the catalytic
activity of Pd nanoparticles was observed from this study. Not only
the alkene group but also the alkyne group was fully hydrogenated
to alkane using octanethiolate-capped Pd nanoparticles. Considering
the importance of chemoselective alkene and alkyne hydrogenation,
octanethiolate-capped palladium nanoparticles proved to be a potentially
recyclable catalyst that operates under mild conditions and promising
for the petrochemical, fine chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.

Experimental Section
Materials
1-Bromooctane (C8H17Br), 2-bromoethylbenzene (C6H5C2H4Br), and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) for synthesizing
the C8 and PhC2 ligands were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Tetraoctylammonium
bromide (TOAB), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and potassium
tetrachloropalladate (II) (K2PdCl4) were obtained
from Acros. In addition, ethanol, methanol, acetone, and toluene were
obtained from Fisher Scientific. Acetone-d6 (CD3COCD3), chloroform-d1 (CDCl3), dimethylsulfoxide-d6 (CD3SOCD3), and methanol-d4 (CD3OD), which are used as solvents for the catalysis
reaction, were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.
Water was purified by using a Barnstead NANO pure Diamond ion exchange
resins purification unit.

Synthesis of Sodium S-Octylthiosulfate
The synthesis followed the previously published procedure from our
group.18,45 A 250 mL round-bottom flask was charged
with 20 mmol 1-bromooctane (C8H17Br) (193.128
g/mol), and 20 mmol sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (248.172 g/mol)
was mixed with 40 mL of ethanol and 40 mL of nanopure water. The flask
was connected to the reflux condenser. The mixture was refluxed for
3 h, and then the sample was evaporated under reduced pressure by
utilizing a rotary evaporator. The white solid product was recrystallized
using hot ethanol and a cooling bath to form the ligand as a crystalline
solid. The ligand was then stored in a vacuum oven for an extended
time. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): triplet (δ
3.1 ppm, α-CH2–S), quintet (δ 1.7 ppm,
β-CH2CH2–S), broad peak (δ
1.3 ppm, −CH2−), and another triplet (δ
0.90 ppm, CH3−). More characterization results for
sodium S-octylthiosulfate in addition to the synthesis
and characterization results for sodium 2-phenyl-1-ethylthiosulfate
are available in the previous publications.18,33,45

Synthesis of Octanethiolate-Capped Palladium Nanoparticles (C8
PdNP)
A 500 mL round-bottom flask was charged with 0.4 mmol
potassium tetrachloropalladate(II) (K2PdCl4,
326.428 g/mol) dissolved in 12 mL of nanopure water and 2.0 mmol TOAB
(546.81 g/mol) dissolved in 25 mL of toluene and stirred for 15 min.
The reaction starts with the phase transfer of the metal precursor
PdCl42– from aqueous phase to organic
phase using TOAB as the phase transfer agent (Scheme 2). The aqueous layer was separated and discarded
using the separatory funnel after the phase transfer. Sodium S-octylthiosulfate ligand (0.8 mmol) was dissolved completely
in 10 mL of 25% methanol. The ligand and 2.0 mmol TOAB were added
at the same time to the organic layer that was placed in a round-bottom
flask, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. The purpose of the
second addition of TOAB is to ensure the transfer of thiosulfate ligands
from the aqueous phase to the organic phase and to provide temporary
capping for the growing nanoparticle before the thiosulfate ligand
is capped onto the nanoparticle. In a falcon tube, 8 mmol NaBH4 (37.83 g/mol) was dissolved in 7 mL of nanopure water and
then added slowly to the stirring reaction flask within 10 s. NaBH4 is used as the reducing agent that initiates the nucleation
growth of Pd nanoparticle. The solution’s color turned black
instantly with the addition of NaBH4, which indicates the
formation of octanethiolate-capped Pd nanoparticles. The reaction
was stirred for 3 h. After the stirring, the solution was placed in
a separatory funnel to remove the aqueous layer. The organic layer
was concentrated by utilizing a rotary evaporator for a few minutes
until the solute became a black solid. The Pd nanoparticles were washed
with ethanol and methanol several times, alternating between sonicating
and centrifuging for 15 min before they were dried under vacuum. The
black powder of C8 PdNP is easily soluble in organic solvents such
as chloroform and toluene and is bench-stable. The synthesis of PhC2
PdNP followed the same procedure that is also available in the previous
publication.33

Scheme 2 Synthesis of C8 PdNP
Characterization of Palladium Nanoparticles
1H NMR spectra were obtained by using Bruker Fourier 400-MHz. The
NMR sample of the Pd nanoparticles was prepared in CDCl3. The 1H NMR spectra of C8 PdNP displayed three small
peaks at 0.8 ppm for methyl and 1.3 and 1.6 ppm for methylenes (Figure S2). The 1H NMR spectra of
PhC2 PdNP displayed one broad peak at 6.8–7.4 ppm for the phenyl
group (Figure S3). The broadening of signals
corresponding to α- and β-CH2CH2–S proposes that the hydrocarbon species derived from sodium S-octylthiosulfate and sodium 2-phenyl-1-ethylthiosulfate
are attached to the nanoparticle.18,45 More spectroscopic
characterization results for C8 PdNP and PhC2 PdNP are available in
the Supporting Information (Figures S2–S7). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using
a JEOL 1200 EX II electron microscope. The particle size was proved
to be around 2.3 ± 0.9 nm for C8 PdNP and 1.7 ± 0.8 nm for
PhC2 PdNP by the TEM images and histograms (Figures 4 and 5). The TEM image
showed that the nanoparticles were spherical and fairly monodisperse.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data were obtained using TA Instruments
SDT Q600. TGA data suggested that the metal ligand ratio was 84.3%
of metal and 15.7% of the ligand for C8 PdNP and 83.0% of metal and
17.0% of the ligand for PhC2 PdNP (Figure S8).

the average core size of C8 PdNP is 2.3 ± 0.9 nm (data obtained
from multiple images).

Catalysis Experiments
In a 50 mL round-bottom flask,
2.5 mL of CDCl3 was placed with 5 mol % Pd nanoparticle
catalyst and covered with a rubber stopper. The solution was purged
with H2 gas for 10 min with two needles, one to let the
H2 gas into the flask and the other to let it out. After
the influx of H2 gas was removed, 0.05 mmol substrate was
injected into the sealed flask using a 1 mL syringe. The reaction
was continuously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. An aliquot
of the solution was transferred to an NMR tube to obtain 1H NMR spectra.
