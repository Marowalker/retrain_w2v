Dendritic β-nucleating agent
(β-NA) can readily manipulate
the formation of dendritic β-crystal with a unique toughening
effect on polypropylene (PP) to drastically enhance the ductility.
However, by the current method, the geometric size is too large to
fully perform the nucleating efficiency. In this study, by comparatively
investigating the effect of molecular weight of PP and diffusion of
β-NAs in a PP melt, we proposed a novel carrier strategy that
selective enrichment of β-NAs in a PP carrier was followed by
directed migration into polymer matrix. Accordingly, the growth of
NAs was controlled by the release from the PP carrier, which decreased
the available amount of β-NAs during the growth stage. In this
case, the viscosity difference between PP carrier and matrix determined
the interfacial movement of β-NAs. When the PP carrier and matrix
had same molecular weight, the diffusion and release became favorable
to facilitate the formation of the dense and fine dendritic aggregates.
As a result, the relative content of β-crystals reached 92%,
with a drastic increase of ∼82% in the optimal condition compared
to the directed compounded PP/β-NAs sample. This study can open
a new avenue to tailor the topologies of β-NAs and the ensuing
β-crystals for high-performance PP products.

Introduction
Polypropylene (PP) is a typical polymorphic
material, and the crystalline
compositions including crystalline modification and topological structure
determine the final properties.1−3 β-Crystal can overcome the
intrinsic inferior toughness of α-crystal and, thus, is more
attractive in real practical applications.4,5 With
respect to the stable α-crystal formed under common processing
conditions, β-crystal is thermodynamically metastable and can
be obtained only under some specific crystallization conditions. Generally,
incorporation of β-nucleating agents (β-NAs) is the most
feasible industrial way to boost the number of β-crystals and
enhance the toughness of PP products.6−8

In recent years,
some soluble β-NAs have been found to dissolve
in PP melts at high temperature and recrystallize into various morphological
aggregations upon cooling, providing a facile and effective tool to
tailor the crystalline morphology and the resulting performance of
PP products.9−11 By adjusting the final solubility of β-NAs,
Varga firstly obtained dot, needle-like, dendritic NA aggregates and
revealed the template effect on the formation of dendritic β-crystals.12 Luo demonstrated that the PP sheet containing
dendritic β-crystals exhibited an increment of 76% in the impact
strength due to better connection between the dendritic crystallites.13 Although soluble β-NAs and their thermally
induced morphologies have been widely studied,14−16 the researches
on the β-NAs morphological regulation mainly focused on relatively
high-molecular-weight PP resins.17,18 In these cases,
dendritic β-NAs, which were generated via dissolution–recrystallization
process, often existed in the form of micrometer-sized aggregates
with thick stems, affording a low specific surface area for heterogeneous
nucleation of β-crystals. As a result, the nucleating efficiency
of β-NAs reduced and some α-crystals were inevitably generated
in the blank zone without β-NAs, which had a negative affect
on the resulting mechanical properties of PP products. Therefore,
it is of great importance to achieve a controllable formation of fine
dendritic aggregates of β-NAs.

Two factors may be taken
into consideration to seize the clue of
minifying the dendritic aggregates. On the one hand, similar to polymer
crystallization, the formation of dendritic β-NAs aggregates
in the PP melt follows the homogeneous nucleation mechanism.19 The size of the resulting β-NAs is determined
by the gap between dissolution and recrystallization temperatures,
which, in turn, depends on the concentrations of β-NAs and molecular
weights of PP.20−22 On the other hand, decreasing the available amount
of β-NAs can restrict the furcating growth of the β-NAs
to generate smaller aggregates.23 Enlightened
by the diffusion-controlled release technology,24,25 a novel carrier strategy that selective enrichment of β-NAs
in a carrier is followed by the directed migration into polymer matrix
should be feasible to regulate the growth of the dendritic aggregates.
To this end, we first study the impact of the molecular weight on
the dissolution and crystallization temperatures of the PP/β-NA
system by constructing a ternary experimental phase diagram of temperature/concentration/molecular
weight. Then, PP resins rich in β-NAs are proposed as a novel
carrier for slowly supplying β-NAs to the PP matrix via thermal
diffusion, and the effects of molecular weights of PP carriers were
investigated to reveal the diffusion mechanism. Finally, the submicron
dendritic β-NAs aggregates with high nucleating efficiency were
obtained, providing a practical instruction for the manipulation of
PP crystalline composition and morphology by varying the topologies
of β-NAs.

Results and Discussion

Diagram of PP/β-NAs Sample:
Dependence of Concentration and Molecular Weight
To study
the morphological evolution of β-NAs, it is necessary to comprehensively
understand the underlying correlation between the dissolution and
crystallization of β-NAs in PP melts. We first investigated
the states of β-NAs in PP melts during the heating/cooling processes.
As demonstrated in many studies,26−28 there are three different
physical states in the corresponding PP melts based on the solubility
of β-NAs, namely solid, solid-saturated solution coexistence,
and unsaturated solution, determining the ensuing morphologies with
the recrystallization during the cooling. A typical growth process
is presented in Figure 1. When β-NAs do not dissolve in PP melt and stay in solid state
at low temperature, they keep the original morphology. Once β-NAs
start to dissolve with the increasing temperature, β-NA/PP solution
becomes saturated. Upon cooling, the dissolved molecules are prone
to crystallization on the nondissolved ones along the preferred direction
under the directing effect of hydrogen bonding between the amide groups
attached to β-NAs, forming the needle-like morphology. With
the complete dissolution, i.e., unsaturated solution, the homogeneous
nucleation and growth will result in the highly branched dendritic
aggregates. The surface of the aggregates hosts a number of nuclei
for the growth of β-crystal, so the topologies of the β-NAs
aggregates can be transformed into the morphologies of the resulting
β-crystal via epitaxial crystallization on the surface. Accordingly,
three morphological β-crystals can be obtained by adjusting
the solution state in PP melt: spherulite, fibrous, and dendritic
crystals.

β-NAs were in (a) solid, (c) saturated, and (f) unsaturated
conditions. (d, g) Morphology of the recrystallized NA aggregates

The prerequisite for dendritic β-crystals is the complete
dissolution of β-NAs in the PP melts during heating, and the
size is strongly dependent on the undercooling, which represents the
gap between dissolution and recrystallization temperatures. Because
the dendritic β-NAs are generated during the cooling process
only when they are completely dissolved in PP melts, the heating temperature
of the special structure forming is defined as the dissolution temperature
(Td). The recrystallization temperature
(Tc) corresponds to the temperature at
which the dissolving β-NAs initially re-appear. Accordingly,
a ternary experimental phase diagram as function of NAs concentration
and molecular weight of PP was constructed, as shown in Figure 2. One can observe that both Td and Tc shift to
higher values with increasing β-NAs concentration and molecular
weight.

(b) recrystallization temperature (Tc)

experimental phase diagram of PP/β-NAs blends as a function
of concentration of β-NAs and molecular weight of PP, where
the blue surface indicates Td, whereas
the green one represents Tc.

The dissolution is a substantial movement and exchange
process
at the interface between the given solute and solvent. It is reported
that solute molecules pass through a stagnant film composed of solvent
molecules surrounding the solid solute surface and then diffuse into
the solvent.29,30 Therefore, the diffusion is a
limiting factor determining the dissolution of β-NAs in the
PP melt. On the basis of Einstein–Sutherland equation,31 the diffusion rate is related to the dissolution
temperature and the viscosity of the polymer melt. 1  where D is the diffusion
constant, kB is Boltzmann’s constant,
η is the viscosity, T is the absolute temperature,
and r is the radius of the solute particle. Accordingly,
variation in the dissolution temperature at the different β-NAs
concentration and PP molecular weight can be well understood. Based
on dissolution equilibrium theory, at a given temperature, the solubility
of β-NAs in PP melts is constant, and the thermal molecular
motion is intensified and D value increases with
increasing temperature, which is favorable for the dissolution of
β-NAs. Obviously, at high concentration of β-NAs, a higher
temperature is required for dissolution. In addition, the viscosity
of polymer melt is related to the molecular weight. With rise in the
molecular weight of PP, the melt viscosity increases, as shown in Figure 3. The D value decreases and the corresponding diffusion of β-NAs from
the boundary layer becomes difficult. Compared to small-molecule solvent,
polymer melt featuring long-chain and entanglement networks exhibits
a unique cage effect on solute molecules, which need to overcome the
large steric hindrance to diffuse through the boundary layer and finally
dissolve into the melt. The constraining effect of the network structure
on molecular motion has been well-discovered.32,33 High-molecular-weight polymer possesses a longer chain with more
inter- and intramolecular entanglements, magnifying the cage effect
to constraint the movements of β-NAs. Therefore, with the increase
in the molecular weight of PP, the dissolution temperature of β-NAs
also rises.

Figure 3 Zero-shear-rate viscosities of PP resins with different molecular
weights.

Analogous to the results investigated
by Kristiansen and his co-workers34−36 for PP/α-NAs (di-benzylidene-sorbitol)
mixtures, PP/β-NAs
mixture follows a typical monotectic phase behavior, as the two components
display totally solid immiscibility and homogeneous solution in liquid
state. Upon cooling, the solubility of β-NAs in PP melts decreases,
initiating recrystallization. The recrystallization of β-NAs
in the PP melt is the homogeneous nucleation and growth process.19 The supercooling expressed by the difference
between dissolution and crystallization temperatures dictates the
size of the resulting β-NAs aggregates. Specially, small aggregate
is only generated at high supercooling.21,37 The contour
map of the gap between the Td and Tc was plotted as a function of the concentration
of β-NAs and the molecular weight of PP. As shown in Figure 4a, the high supercooling
is only observed in the narrow region of the concentration lower than
0.2% and molecular weight less than 2.5 × 105 g/mol.
Therefore, fine dendritic aggregates of β-NAs only can be obtained
in PP of low molecular weight. Here, two key issues should be noted.
First, for the low-molecular-weight PP, the self-nucleation originating
from quick molecular motion ability is evident, deteriorating β-nucleating
efficiency of β-NAs.38 In this case,
α-crystals prevail over β-crystals, which are verified
by dark α-crystals featuring positive bi-refringence in Figure 4b1. Second, with
increasing either molecular weight or β-NAs concentration, the
nucleating efficiency is promoted, but it is inevitable to cause the
supercooling to decrease. As a result, β-NAs aggregates in Figure 4b2–b5 are
more than 200 μm and even reach 600 μm in the lowest supercooling.
The β-crystals grow in the zone adjacent to the β-NAs,
whereas α-crystals appear in the blank zone without β-NAs.
Unambiguously, it is extremely difficult for PP to generate a large
number of fine dendritic β-crystals due to the mismatch between
supercooling and nucleating efficiency.

Morphological Manipulation of β-NAs via Diffusion-Controlled
Release Technology
In the conventional compounding samples,
all of the NAs are dispersed homogeneously in the matrix and the size
of the resulting β-NAs aggregates is determined by the gap between
dissolution and recrystallization temperatures. However, the gap of
polar β-NAs in a nonpolar PP, especially a high-molecular-weight
one, is low, so the size of β-NAs often is large. Inspired by
diffusion-controlled release of drug, β-NAs were first distributed
into one kind of PP to obtain a β-NA carrier (c-NA); then the
c-NA was added into pure PP matrix. In the diffusion-controlled release
process, the growth of β-NA is controlled by the releasing rate
of NAs from PP carrier, which can decrease the available amount of
β-NAs during the growth stage. As a result, the smaller aggregates
can be obtained. In this study, the widely used PP resin having molecular
weight of 477 100 g/mol was chosen as a model because β-NAs
can promote the crystallization in the form of β-crystal.39,40 Expectedly, the growth of dendritic β-NAs in PP matrix can
be weakened via the diffusion-controlled release of β-NAs to
obtain homogeneous fine dendritic β-NAs and the ensuring β-crystal.
First, the effect of the diffusion between same molecular weight PP
on the morphology of β-NAs was revealed. In this case, the molecular
weight of β-NAs-loaded PP carrier and PP matrix is the same. Figure 5 displays the morphological
evolution of β-NAs during the cooling process. Initially, needle-like
β-NAs appeared at the interface between the two PP phases (Figure 5b,c). With the decrease
in the temperature, the fibrous β-NAs branched and large numbers
of three-dimensional dendrites evolved from the melt. Compared to
the conventional compounding way in which β-NAs were directly
incorporated into PP matrix (Figure 4b3), the mean size of dendritic β-NAs decreased
from over 500 to 88.5 μm via the diffusion-controlled release
technology. Obviously, the diffusion of β-NAs from the PP carrier
containing β-NAs effectively controls the growth of dendritic
β-NAs.

Figure 5 Morphological evolution of PP3/β-NAs sample during
cooling
from 250 °C. The photos are taken at (a) 230 °C, (b) 190
°C, (c) 165 °C, (d) 155 °C, (e) 145 °C, and (f)
137 °C, respectively.

It should be noticed that the amount of β-NAs was 1%
in the
carrier, where β-NAs cannot dissolve completely in the PP melts.
The diffused β-NAs are possibly stemmed from two forms, namely
solid aggregated particles and the dissolving molecules. It must be
answered that which kind of β-NAs dominates the diffusion. Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) are insolvable and easily assemble into micrometer-sized
aggregates, which are similar to the insoluble β-NA aggregates.
Therefore, CNTs can be utilized as tracing elements to reveal the
diffusion behavior of the β-NAs in the PP matrix. As shown in Figure 6, the interface between
CNTs and pure PP stays discernable and unchanged in the whole heating
cycle. On the contrary, for PP/NAs sample, the interface extended
gradually. It can be deduced that the solid β-NAs aggregated
particles have no moving ability, and the dendritic β-NAs completely
resulted from the diffusion of the dissolving β-NAs from the
PP carrier. When it happens, the physical state of β-NAs-loaded
carrier is transformed from solid-saturated solution to solid-unsaturated
solution, leading to the further dissolution of the aggregated particles.
The dissolving β-NAs are supplied sequentially and diffused
into PP matrix, so the nucleation and growth of the dendritic β-NAs
proceed simultaneously. As a result, the resulting aggregates exhibit
small size. The formation mechanism of fine dendritic β-NAs
controlled via diffusion-controlled release is proposed as in Figure 7.

Figure 6 PLM photos of the migration
behavior for (a) CNTs and (b) β-NAs

(a3, b3). The blue line indicates the interface between pure PP phase
and the modified PP phase.

Figure 7 Formation mechanism of fine dendritic β-NAs controlled via
diffusion-controlled release.

Further, the effect of the PP carriers with different molecular
weight was investigated. As shown in Figure 8, when the molecular weight of the PP carrier
is higher than that of PP matrix, fine dendritic aggregates of β-NAs
are observed, similar to the result of Figure 5; in the case of the carrier with the molecular
weight lower than that of PP matrix, only few dendritic aggregates
of β-NAs are confined to the interface between the carrier and
PP matrix. This variation can be ascribed to the viscosity difference
between the PP carrier and matrix. The viscosity of polymer melt is
highly related to the molecular weight. High-molecular-weight PP exhibits
high viscosity. When the viscosity of the carrier is higher than that
of PP matrix, the diffusion of β-NAs happens readily along the
decreased-viscosity direction. On the contrary, there is the resistance
effect induced by the increased viscosity on the diffusion of β-NA,
which can compel the backflow to less viscous carrier in the form
of favorable energy. The diffusion of β-NAs out of the carrier
is difficult and the resulting dendritic aggregates are few (Figure 8c). This is similar
to the dispersion of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with different
substitutes in polystyrene bulk from Misra group, where the retardant
dissolution caused the preferential surface aggregation of the diffusing
particles.41 Additionally, comparison between Figure 8a,b demonstrates
that when the carrier has the same molecular weight as the matrix,
more β-NAs are diffused from the carrier compared to the higher-molecular-weight
carrier. This can be attributed to the strong mobility of β-NAs
in the less viscous PP carrier. Accordingly, we can come to a conclusion
that when the PP carrier and PP matrix share the same molecular weight,
the fine dendritic β-NAs and β-crystals can be achieved
via diffusion-controlled release technology.

(b) PP3, and (c) PP5 into PP3 matrix. (a1–c1) Corresponding
polarized photos with the diameter distributions of the aggregates.

Finally, the relative contents
of β-crystals (Kβ) in the
samples were evaluated by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) melting curves. The peaks below 155 °C
in Figure 9 correspond
to the melting of β-crystals, whereas the melting peak above
155 °C resulted from α-crystal.42 When β-NAs are blended directly with the PP matrix, Kβ presents the lowest value, which should
be attributed to low specific surface area of large β-NAs featuring
more than 300 μm size generated at the low supercooling (Figure 4b2). On the contrary,
with the diffusion-released strategy, the fine aggregates are generated,
providing more available nuclei for PP crystallization to facilitate
the formation of β-NAs; moreover, the size and content of β-NAs
can be controlled by regulating the molecular weight of the PP carrier.
When the carrier has the same molecular weight as the PP matrix, the
diffusion of β-NAs from the carrier becomes more favorable,
leading to dense and finer dendritic β-NAs. As a result, the Kβ reaches 92%, with a drastic increase
of ∼82% compared to the directed compounded PP/β-NAs
sample (HPP). Moreover, it seems interesting that there are double
peaks of β-crystals in the directed compounded PP/β-NAs
sample. As stated earlier, micrometer-sized β-NAs in the sample
have a low specific surface area and thus low nucleating efficiency
of β-NAs, resulting in imperfect β-crystals.43 During the heating process, the less stable
β-crystal will be transformed into the stable one, thus two
melting peaks of β-crystal are observed at ∼155 °C.
For the samples prepared via the diffusion strategy, fine β-NAs
exhibit a high specific surface area to facilitate sufficient crystallization
of PP, generating more perfect β-crystals with single melting
peak.

Conclusions
In
this study, the experimental phase diagram for the binary system
consisting of PP and β-NAs was constructed to reveal the dependence
of the concentration and PP molecular weight on the solubility and
crystallization of β-NAs in PP melts. The results showed that
high supercooling was only observed in the narrow region of the concentration
lower than 0.2% and molecular weight less than 2.5 × 105 g/mol. Nevertheless, fine dendritic β-crystals cannot be obtained
in bulk matrix due to the rapid crystallization of α-form crystal.
On the contrary, when β-NAs were selectively distributed in
the PP carrier, the growth of dendritic β-NAs was determined
by the diffusion of β-NAs out of the carrier, which decreased
the available amount of β-NAs during the growth stage. As a
result, submicron dendritic NAs and β-crystals were generated.
Moreover, the releasing efficiency of β-NAs depended on the
viscosity difference between the carrier and matrix. Only if the PP
carrier and the matrix had the same molecular weight, the dense and
fine β-NAs were formed. The fine dendritic aggregates featuring
high specific surface area can provide more available nuclei for PP
crystallization to facilitate the formation of β-crystals, which
not only drastically increases the fraction of the β-crystals
but also promotes the crystallization of more perfect crystal.

Samples Preparation
To achieve a
uniform dispersion
of β-NAs in the matrix, a simple two-step method was applied
to prepare β-NAs-containing PP in this study. First, the master
batches of PP/β-NAs mixture with 1 wt % concentration were melting
blended by a micro twin-screw extruder to achieve the desired dispersion.
The temperature from barrel to die was set from 150 to 185 °C,
with a screw speed of 25 rpm. After granulating, the master batches
were then diluted to the expected concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
0.4, 0.5, and 0.7 wt % by adding pure PPs, and extruded again via
the same mixing process. For comparison purpose, PP with 0.1 wt %
carbon nanotube (CNT) was also prepared in the same way.

Characterization
Polarized
Light Microscope (PLM)
The phase behaviors
of the samples were directly observed by polarized light microscope
(Leica DM2500P) connected to a hot stage (Linkam THMS600, Linkam Scientific
Instruments Ltd., U.K.) and a Pixelink camera (PL-A662). Samples were
initially heated to the expected temperature at a rate of 30 °C/min
and then held for 5 min to realize thermodynamic equilibrium. Afterward,
the samples were cooled to 135 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min,
and the self-assembling morphologies of β-NAs were recorded.

Figure 10 illustrates
the observation process of the specimens used for diffusion behavior:
(a) both pure PP and 1 wt % β-NAs-containing PP pellets were
first compressed into thin film using two hot glass slides at 180
°C. The β-NAs-containing PP film (c-NA) was then cut to
the appreciated size and put in the center of the pure one via hot
compressing at 180 °C. (b) The specimens were heated to 250 °C
to partly dissolve β-NAs, thus triggering the diffusion from
c-NA to PP matrix. (c) After cooling, the diffusion was terminated,
and the β-NAs self-assembled to dendritic aggregates in the
PP matrix. For convenience, PPx–y was defined, where x presented
the kind of the carrier and y corresponded to the
kind of the matrix.

Figure 10 Schematic illustration for the observing process of β-NA
diffusion from the PP carrier to PP matrix: (a) placing the c-NA film
in the center of the pure one; (b) heating and holding temperature
to trigger the diffusion; (c) cooling to observe the self-assembling
morphology of β-NAs in PP matrix.

In addition, the morphologies of the dendritic β-NA
aggregates
were first recorded by the Pixelink camera and then the Linkage software
provided by Linkam Scientific Instruments was utilized to analyze
the size of the dendritic aggregates. Over 100 dendritic crystalline
aggregates were recorded and the average size and distribution were
calculated.

Rheological Tests
The extruded pellets
were first dried
in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 4 h and then pressed into a 2 mm
thick sheet at 180 °C on a hot press. The zero-shear-rate viscosity
was then measured by using a rotary rheometer (AR2000, TA instruments)
in the steady sweep mode with a shear rate from 0.01 to 10 s–1. The plate diameter was 25 mm and the gap was 1 mm. All of the samples
were in equilibrium at 250 °C in the oven for 5 min before start.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The relative
fractions of β-crystal (Kβ) of samples were investigated with a Q20 differential scanning calorimetry
apparatus (TA), which was calibrated using indium and zinc standards.
For the samples prepared via the diffusion-released technology, the
content of β-NAs in the PP carrier was 1 wt %. The diffusion
regions in the observed PLM specimens were cut and then heated from
40 to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The relative fraction
of β-crystal (Kβ) is calculated
according to the following equations 2  where Xα and Xβ are the crystallinities
of the α- and β-crystals, respectively, and they can be
obtained by 3  where ΔHi is the measured fusion and ΔHio is the standard
fusion heat (177 J/g for the α-crystal and 168.5 J/g for the
β-crystal13).

For comparison,
the homogeneous compounded one with 0.1 wt % NAs was also investigated
at the same condition.
