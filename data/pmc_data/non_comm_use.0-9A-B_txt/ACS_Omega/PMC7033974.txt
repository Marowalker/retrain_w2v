Hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts
were prepared by desilication
and impregnation with 2 wt % metallic ZnO. X-ray diffraction and Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) results showed that the structures of the
hierarchical zeolites were relatively preserved despite desilication
but were accompanied with sequential loss in crystallinity, likewise
Bro̷nsted acidity causing decline in conversion or activity
of the catalyst. However, pyridine FTIR shows enhancement of the Bro̷nsted
acidic sites. Throughout the activity test, the hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5
catalysts showed an outstanding performance within 5 h on stream with
the average aromatic (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) selectivity trend,
represented by their NaOH concentrations 0.3 M > 0.4 M > 0.2
M > 0.1
M corresponding to 61.0, 53.5, 40.3, and 36.8%, respectively. Their
average propane conversions within the same period followed a consecutive
trend 0.1 M > 0.2 M > 0.3 M > 0.4 M conforming to 34.1, 24.8,
17.3,
and 10.2%, respectively. These were compared with that of the reference
(ZnO/ZSM-5), which exhibited an average aromatic selectivity of 25.2%
and propane conversion of 39.7%. Furthermore, the hierarchical catalyst
generally displayed a low amount of C9+ heavier aromatics with the
ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M) catalyst having the lowest C9+ selectivity of 23.7%
compared to the reference catalyst with 72.7% at the same time on
stream.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The conversion of light
alkanes into aromatic compounds mainly
benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX) is one of the major industrial
processes that has attracted so much attention due to the BTX’s
wide range of application as intermediate materials in both chemical
and petrochemical industries.1 They are
used for blending with gasoline to enhance the octane number.2 In addition, toluene is used in the production
of adhesives and benzene is extensively used in the downstream chemical
processes such as production of styrene and phenol, while xylenes
are essential for production of purified terephthalic and isophthalic
acids.3 Currently, BTX are produced from
naphtha. However, recent research efforts are focused on catalyst
development for BTX production from alternative feedstocks such as
light alkanes.4 Moreover, rapid progress
has been made recently in utilizing stranded natural gas reserves
for converting gas to liquid using a non-oxidative methane dehydroaromatization
(DHA) catalytic route whereby the conventional gas-to-liquid (GTL)
technologies become economically unaffordable.5 The major challenges experienced so far in its implementation are
the thermodynamic barrier, which limits the benzene yield to 12–13%
at 700 °C, and rapid catalyst deactivation as a result of coke
accumulation on the surface of the catalyst, which accounts for 10–20%
methane conversion when the Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is employed.6 A key research question in developing such a
catalyst is the relative difference in diffusivity between light alkanes
and aromatics and the effects of the difference on the BTX selectivity.7 The H-ZSM-5 may be employed as a catalyst, but
it undergoes quick deactivation and also causes cracking that leads
to a large selectivity for C1 and C2 products.8 This problem has been overcome by the addition
of transition metals such a zinc, platinum, or gallium to facilitate
the dehydrogenation activity and to suppress cracking.1 Despite this improvement, an important drawback of the
H-ZSM-5-based catalysts is their small pores, which results in poor
metal dispersion and inadequate diffusion leading to the formation
of bulkier aromatic products.9,10 The new mesoporous
and microporous composite that combines both the pore structure advantage
of the mesopore and the strong acidity of the zeolite is one of the
most promising materials that enhance the diffusion rate and expose
the active sites for reactions.11 These
materials enable mass transport of larger reactants and products and
thus allow acid-catalyzed reactions to proceed on the mesopore surface
and pore mouth, which alternatively serve in improving existing reactions/processes
currently using zeolite catalysts.12 The
proven qualities of hierarchical zeolites have necessitated their
use extensively by some researchers in the past for propane aromatization
with more utilization of gallium, platinum, and zinc as dehydrogenating
metals. However, prior to the adoption of hierarchical catalysts,
the formation, structure, and dispersion of active gallium species
were a matter of great challenge due to its bulky nature; various
methods such as hydrothermal in situ synthesis and post synthesis
treatments (impregnation, ion-exchange, chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), and reduction–oxidation treatments) were employed for
the incorporation of gallium into H-ZSM-5.13 Moreover, the cases of gallium leaching have also been reported.14 In addition, the poisonous nature and high price
of gallium compared to zinc pose a limiting role. Besides, the only
disadvantage of zinc so far observed was its vaporization from the
catalyst bed at severe treatments (≥550 °C).15

Some of the works carried out on propane
aromatization include
that of Akhtar et al.3 who showed that
the creation of intracrystalline mesoporosity into H-Ga-ZSM-11 via
desilication significantly improve propane aromatization. The conversion
of propane over H-Ga-ZSM-11 increased from 1.3 to 10.3% after desilication,
whereas the BTX yield increased from 2.72 to 34.2%, a similar trend
was also observed for n-hexane aromatization. The
work carried out by Al-Yassir et al.3 in
the synthesis of stable ordered mesoporous H-galloaluminosilicate
using surfactant-mediated hydrolysis approach significantly improved
the dispersion of gallium species in the form of extraframework, which
enhanced its aromatization activity. The optimal ordered mesoporous
H-galloaluminosilicate sample exhibited superior performance and stability
with a propane conversion of 56.3% as compared with 30.8% provided
by the steamed conventional H-galloaluminosilicate. Also, at comparable
conversion level, ordered mesoporous H-galloaluminosilicate was more
selective to BTX with 58.3% as compared with 42.5% for the steamed
conventional sample. The superior aromatization was attributed to
hydrothermal synthesis and hierarchical pore arrangements on the dispersion
of gallium species. Another recent work by Ogunronbi et al.3 investigates the effects of introducing different
types of mesoporosities in microporous Ga-ZSM-5, with random intracrystalline
and ordered intercrystalline MCM-41 mesostructures. Using this catalyst,
propane conversion increased to 33.9, 47.4, and 33.4% upon alkaline
treatment, CTAB-mediated hydrolysis, and coating with the MCM-41 layer,
respectively, up from 30.3% for microporous Ga-ZSM-5. At conversion
of 13–15%, the mesoporous samples were more selective to BTX
with ∼56% as compared to 48.9% for the microporous sample.
Furthermore, previous works have shown that apart from the diffusion
problem sustained by the microporous ZnO/ZSM-5, a low selectivity
to aromatics was observed on these catalysts.17 Therefore, this work focuses on improving the textural properties
of the catalyst by synthesizing hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 with high porosity
for propane aromatization.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of reference and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts are
depicted in Figure 1. It is observed that all the synthesized catalysts showed the characteristics
peaks of a typical ZSM-5 zeolite at 2θ equal to 8.00°,
8.86°, 23.14°, 24.00°, and 45.51° (JCPDS 00-042-0024),
with a monoclinic crystal system. The obtained results are a clear
indication that despite the desilication and ZnO deposition, the parent
ZSM-5 structure is maintained. However, a closer observation of the
peaks at 8°–10° and 22°–25° shows
a great suppression of peak intensity as the NaOH concentration increases,
which indicates a fractional dissolution of the ZSM-5 framework and
decrease in crystallinity.16,17 The results obtained
are in agreement with that of Sadowska et al.18 who reported that mild desilication of ZSM-5 (0.1 M and 0.2 M NaOH)
has no obvious effect on the crystallinity. However, higher concentration
of NaOH causes a noticeable effect on the crystallinity. Furthermore,
there was no noticeable peak(s) to show the presence of ZnO from the
XRD patterns and this could be attributed to the detection limit of
the XRD analyzer used as only 2 wt % ZnO was impregnated for all the
catalysts. A zinc content of 0.5–2 wt % was determined by Iwamoto
et al.19 to exhibit good and stable activity
for the aromatization reaction at 350–550 °C range.

catalysts.

2.2 Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The FTIR spectra of
reference and hierarchical ZnO/H-ZSM-5 in the
lattice vibration region (400–4000 cm–1)
are shown in Figure 2. The intensity of the bands at 450, 550, and 790 cm–1 represents the bending vibration of SiO4 and AlO4 groups in the H-ZSM-5 framework. The 450 and 550 cm–1 bands, which also represent the five-membered ring pentasil unit
of the ZSM-5 structure likewise zeolite crystallinity, are clearly
reduced upon desilication treatment aimed at generating mesopores.
This further supports the XRD data since the reduction in the aforementioned
bands corresponds to crystallinity loss as well.14 The absorption band at 1100 cm–1 with
a take-up at 1225 cm–1 represents the external asymmetric
stretching of the Si–O–Si bridge. The stretching vibration
of the band at 1627 cm–1 implies the existence of
hydroxyl groups (OH–) of absorbed water on the surface
of ZSM-5 while the band at 3445 cm–1 signifies that
stretching of internal tetrahedral Si–OH–Al hydroxyl
bridges attributed to Bro̷nsted acid sites is also broadening
as compared to the parent ZnO/ZSM-5; likewise, the band at 3660 cm–1 represents the terminal Al–OH groups, which
is consistent with Razavian et al. findings.20

2.3 Nitrogen Sorption Studies
Nitrogen
(N2) adsorption–desorption isotherms of both microporous
(reference) and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Figure 3, while Table 1 presents the surface
areas, pore volumes, and average pore sizes for the synthesized catalysts.
The ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited characteristics of the type I isotherm
that are often associated with materials that have extremely fine
micropores and low fractions of mesopores, according to IUPAC classification.21 Though the ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the presence
of the hysteresis loop, its large range for the hysteresis loop indicates
the H4-type hysteresis loop with slit-like pores.21 However, after desilication with NaOH of different
concentrations, there was a change from the type I to type IV
isotherm classification of the hysteresis loop. As the NaOH concentrations
increases, there was an increase in the hysteresis loop, which is
associated with capillary condensations in the mesopores of the desilicated
catalysts.22 The adsorption and desorption
branches of the hysteresis loop exhibited by the desilicated catalysts
are the characteristics of the H3-type hysteresis loop and also with
a slit-like pore but with increased mesopores from 31.7–100%
(Table 1).21 Furthermore, both the micropore area and volume
decrease as the NaOH concentration increases. These trends show that
the percentage mesoporosity increases at the expense of the micropores
(Table 1), agreeing
with the results in the open literature.21,22

Table 1 shows the
textural properties of the reference and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts.
Upon alkaline treatment for 2 h at 65 °C using a Si/Al ratio
of 50, ZnO/ZSM-5(0.4 M) showed a complete loss of microporosity (Vmicro = 0 cm3/g) implying 100% retention
of mesoporosity. This is in proximity to the findings made by Xiao
et al.13 who demonstrated that upon alkaline
treatment at 75 °C for 2 h using a Si/Al ratio of 25, (0.5 M
and 0.7 M) NaOH concentrations led to severe destruction of the micropores;
moreover, several portions of the framework had collapsed and big
void defects with dimensions exceeding 50 nm were formed, meaning
that the pore system of the zeolite was seriously destroyed. The influence
of the Si/Al ratio was also studied by Na and Somorjai24 whose work demonstrated that the higher the
Si/Al ratio, the more prone the catalyst to excessive Si dissolution.
The pioneering work by Groen et al.25 showed
that the Si/Al ratio within the range of 25–50 is the optimal
for developing a uniform mesoporous structure, which is highly dependent
on temperature and time. From this, it can be confirmed that alkaline
treatment conditions (temperature, time, and Si/Al ratio) play a vital
role in fine-tuning mesoporosity development by desilication.

Table 1 also shows
that desilication caused changes in the elemental composition as compared
with the reference catalyst. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZnO/ZSM-5 decreased upon treatment with NaOH, from
47 to 41, 35, 26, and 22 as expected upon treatment with NaOH solutions
of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M concentrations, respectively. A similar
trend was reported by Xiao et al.23 and
Groen et al.25

2.4 Pyridine
FTIR
The FTIR spectra of
chemisorbed pyridine for the reference and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM5 catalysts
are depicted in Figure 4. Upon alkaline treatment, there was a sequential decrease in the
intensity of 1450 cm–1 band (Lewis sites) coupled
with an increase in the intensity of 1550 cm–1 band
(Bro̷nsted sites). The increase in framework Al was as a result
of Si leaching from the framework as shown in Table 1. This further corroborates the results shown
in Figure 4. Nevertheless,
the increased Bro̷nsted acidity could be associated with the
addition of H+ ions during ion exchange and realumination
caused by leached alumina during desilication, which conforms to the
work carried out by Fang et al.11 and Verboekend
et al.27

ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst.

2.5 Propane
Aromatization
Aromatization
of propane over bifunctional zeolite catalysts involves a series of
complex heterogeneous reactions that include dehydrogenation, oligomerization,
cyclization, and aromatization with excessive cracking as the side
reaction. In the propane aromatization process, the Bro̷nsted
acid sites are responsible for the oligomerization, cyclization, and
cracking of olefins while the Lewis acid sites catalyze the dehydrogenation
of alkanes and cycloalkene intermediates.28 According to Li et al.,26,29 porosity and acidity
are generally considered to be the main factors influencing product
selectivity and stability.

The catalytic performances of the
reference and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Figure 5A–E. Figure 5A shows the result
on a catalyst that has not been subjected to NaOH treatment but was
impregnated with 2 wt % zinc oxide just like other catalysts. Its
performance depicts a gradual decrease in propane conversion that
was observed within 5 h on stream. This began with a sharp conversion
of around 47% at 1 h and then declined gradually with time to 32%
at 5 h on stream. The high propane conversion within 2 h signifies
good dehydrogenation activity of the reference ZnO/ZSM-5 influenced
by the Bro̷nsted acid sites and the active metal ZnO species.
Zinc cations are unable to perform propane dehydrogenation steps without
the simultaneous presence of strong Bro̷nsted acid sites, which
appear to be involved in the initial activation of C–H bonds
in alkanes.30 The decline in conversion
after 2 h may possibly be due to poor diffusion of the propane molecules
to acidic sites located within the zeolite cavities as a result of
smaller pore size or pore blockage prevailing in surface reactions,
which leads to massive coke depositions.9

Figure 5 (A–E)
Time on stream experiment of propane aromatization
over reference and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts at 540° C.
Propane: nitrogen ratio of 1:2 and WHSV of 1200 mL/g h.

The low aromatic selectivity within the range of 21–27%
after 5 h on stream could be ascribed to confinement of aromatic products
within the micropores of the catalyst and consequently increasing
the residence time leading to over-cracking and eventually tilting
the selectivity to methane and ethylene, which are secondary products
of the reaction. This trend is in agreement with the work of Kim et
al.31 and Ogunronbi et al.14

The performance of hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1 M)
catalyst is depicted
in Figure 5B. A consistent
drop in propane conversion was observed from 39 to 30% within 5 h
on stream. The conversion at 1 h for the ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1 M) catalyst
was 39%, a bit lower than that of the reference catalyst (Figure 5A). A linear increment
in aromatic selectivity was also observed from 26 to 44% within 5
h. This increase could be attributed to improved diffusion of the
desired products out of the intraframework mesoporous channels of
the catalyst.

The catalytic activity of the ZnO/ZSM-5(0.2 M)
catalyst is presented
in Figure 5C. This
shows a relatively stable conversion of 24–25% within 5 h on
stream. It can be seen that the conversion activity of the catalyst
at 1 h dropped to 24%, which was lower than that of ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1
M) (39%). The superior performance of the ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1 M) catalyst
could be attributed to its higher dehydrogenation activity influenced
by the deposited metal species. In addition, an increased aromatic
selectivity was observed from 30 to 55% within 2 to 5 h on stream.
The improved selectivity could be as a result of the superior acidity
and textural properties of the catalyst.

The ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M)
catalyst (Figure 5D)
shows a low conversion (23%), which consistently
declined to 17% within 5 h on stream. This shows a drop-in dehydrogenation
activity influenced by the acid sites responsible for cracking and
the active metal phase, which facilitate the dehydrogenation process.
Moreover, the increased aromatic selectivity from 43–71% within
5 h on stream could be attributed to improved acidity and porosity,
which enables efficient transport of the reactant and desired product
out of the intraframework channels due to a wider pore size of 5.52
nm (Table 1).The maximum
aromatic selectivity attained by ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M) is 71% while that
of the reference catalyst is 31% within the same time range.

For the ZnO/ZSM-5(0.4 M) catalyst (Figure 5E), a very low conversion was observed, which
consistently declines within 5 h. The relative low conversion could
be attributed to almost complete loss of shape-selective properties
as evidenced from the micropore volume (Vmicro = 0.0 cm3/g from Table 1). The high aromatic selectivity displayed at 1 h could
be ascribed to enhanced acidity and diffusion of reactants and products
(100% mesoporous) coupled with wider pores (Table 1). The gradual decline in selectivity after
1 h can be ascribed to the preferential deactivation of strong Bro̷nsted
and Lewis acid sites, which promotes hydride abstract that could be
the factor contributing to the selectivity decline with time on stream.4

2.6 Effect of NaOH Treatment
on Catalyst Performance
within 5 h on Stream
The effect of NaOH treatment on catalyst
performance is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that propane conversion decreases with the
increase in NaOH concentration. The reference ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst has
the highest conversion of 39.7% while for the hierarchical catalysts,
the conversion values were 34.1, 24.8, 17.3, and 10.2%. The reason
for higher conversion for the reference ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst could be
attributed to the Bro̷nsted acid sites responsible for cracking
and the active metal phase, which enables high dehydrogenation activity
of the catalyst. However, a low aromatic selectivity of 25.2% was
observed for the reference ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst, which could be attributed
to its pore geometry (size and shape) exhibiting an average pore width
of 2.25 nm (from Table 1). The hierarchical catalyst selectivity increases progressively
with increasing NaOH concentration from 0.1 to 0.3 M (36.8 to 60.9%)
but decreases the 0.4 M NaOH concentration to 53.5%. These improvements
could be attributed to the enhanced acidity as evidenced by the decrease
in a Si/Al ratio from 47 to 22 and porosity of these materials from
4.59 to 6.24 nm (from Table 1), which accelerate the reaction and better transport of the
products out of their channels.

performance within
5 h on stream.

2.7 Product
Distribution of Reference and Hierarchical
ZnO/ZSM-5 Catalysts
The liquid product distribution of the
reference and hierarchical ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts is shown in Figure 7. The ZnO/ZSM-5 microporous
catalyst is more selective toward C9+ and its selectivity toward aromatic
products is negligible. The poor selectivity toward aromatic compounds
could be attributed to the highly crystalline nature as portrayed
by the XRD diffraction patterns in Figure 1 and possibly pore blockage as a result of
insufficient ZnO deposition into its narrow pores of 2.25 nm with
a high surface area of 386 m2/g as shown from the BET results
in Table 1. The aromatic
products tend to be retained in the microporous domains of the catalyst,
which prolongs the residence time, thereby resulting in the formation
of gaseous products due to cracking.14,32,33

Figure 7 Liquid product distribution of the reference and hierarchical
ZnO/ZSM-5
catalysts at 5 h on stream.

However, with respect to individual aromatic products, the best
performing catalyst, ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M), depicts a lesser crystalline
material (Figure 1), exhibiting a wider pore size of 5.52 nm and a relatively lower
surface area of 273 m2/g (Table 1), which dropped by 29% as compared with
the reference material, likewise had its highest selectivity toward
toluene, benzene, and m-xylene products with 33.3,
13.4, and 12.8%, respectively. ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1 M) was relatively crystalline,
portraying 4.59 nm pore width and an abnormal drop in total surface
area by 34% (255 m2/g) as compared to the reference catalyst.
This inconsistent drop in the surface area could be attributed to
pore blockage as a result of realumination caused by leached alumina
during desilication back into the framework. However, the catalyst
favored mostly the production of ethyl benzene with 6.4% while ZnO/ZSM-5(0.2
M), a fairly crystalline material (Figure 1), depicts 4.91 nm pore width and a surface
area of 281 m2/g (27% drop in surface area) compared to
the reference material. This catalyst favored the o-xylene product most with 12.4%. The reference catalyst exhibits
the highest negligible selectivity of 1.9% for the p-xylene isomer as compared with the hierarchical catalysts. Another
critical trend to note from Figure 7 is that a further increase in amorphous nature of
the material or loss in crystallinity from 0.1 to 0.4 M desilication
range yields more (C1–C5) gaseous products due to excessive
cracking despite wider pore width, which facilitates transport to
and from the catalyst. ZnO/ZSM-5(0.4 M), a highly amorphous material
(Figure 2), with a
widest pore width of 6.24 nm and a surface area of 107 m2/g (72% drop in surface area) as compared with the reference catalyst
produced the highest amount of (C1–C5) gaseous products among
other catalysts. Moreover, insignificant amounts of the light liquids
were observed for virtually all the catalyst samples. The light liquid
compositions for 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M desilicated catalysts were
0.41, 0.08, 0.17, and 0.73%, respectively, while for the reference
catalyst was 0.77% being a bit higher than the ZnO/ZSM-5(0.4 M) catalyst.

In general, benzene, m-xylene, and toluene selectivities
increase gradually for the 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 M NaOH-treated catalysts
but decrease for the 0.4 M NaOH-treated catalyst. These increased
trends demonstrated by benzene, toluene, and m-xylene
products could be attributed to the alkylation reaction, which is
an acid catalyzed reaction predominantly favored by catalysts with
higher acidity. Alkylation is a subsequent step in the aromatization
of propane, which is the backbone of producing various aromatics products.
Alkylation is directed by electrophilic substitution in which an electrophile,
usually an alkyl substituent, attacks the benzene ring leading to
the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation known as an arenium
ion.34 Furthermore, the most stable carbocation
intermediate will have the lowest activation energy (Ea); likewise, the fastest rate and therefore would be
the major product.35,36 As such, the reason for high
toluene composition in ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M) could further be explained
based on the stability of the toluene molecule by the presence of
a methyl group on the benzene ring, that is, this activates the aromatic
ring by increasing the electron density on the ring through an “inductive
donating effect”, and this electron donating property allows
the alkyl group to stabilize the carbocation on the benzene ring.
Benzene also showed similar behavior at ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M) and this
could be related to its high thermodynamic and chemical stability
due to the presence of its delocalized π-electrons above and
below the plane of the ring.34 Meanwhile,
the reason for the decreased selectivies of o- and p-xylenes and an increased selectivity of m-xylene within the range of 0.1–0.3 M desilicated catalysts
could be explained on the basis of their thermodynamic and kinetic
stabilities. The m-xylene isomer is a thermodynamically
controlled product, whereas the other two isomers are kinetically
controlled products, which can influence the composition of the respective
products, and m-xylene is the most stable product
among the xylene isomers because in ortho- and para-xylene, electron density becomes high due to resonance
or mesomeric (+R) effect of the methyl (CH3) group.34 That is, since it is an ortho–para directing group, this is not seen in
the case of the meta-xylene isomer. During the isomerization
reaction, rearrangement involving hydride shift instead of methyl
shift could also occur, with the exception of the meta-carbonium ion, its two methyl groups in one of the canonical structures
are capable of partially neutralizing the positive charges on the
carbon ring atoms, while in the other two isomers, only one methyl
group can behave this way; thus, its meta-carbonium
ion will be more stable than the other two and as such equilibrium
is shifted to the formation of the m-xylene isomer.35,37 In contrast to methyl-benzene (toluene) selectivity, ethyl-benzene
selectivity decreased within 0.2–0.4 M desilication series,
which is least stable compared to the latter. This could be explained
on the concept of hyperconjugation of the alkyl substituents.34 This is due to the fact that the hyperconjugation
effect dominates over the inductive effect. The methyl group has three
α-hydrogen atoms, which will fill the carbonium ion deficiency
and increase the electron density of the benzene ring to a greater
extent, whereas the ethyl group has two α-hydrogens, which is
less when compared.

3 Conclusions
Hierarchical
ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts were successfully synthesized,
characterized, and tested in a microfixed bed reactor at a pressure
of 1 atm, temperature of 540 °C, and weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) of 1200 mL/g h. The XRD analysis showed a progressive loss
of zeolite crystallinity as concentration of NaOH increases from 0.1
to 0.4 M, which was attributed to silica leaching from the framework
without complete lattice destruction. ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M) showed the
optimal performance with the highest aromatic selectivity of 61.0%
at the expense of propane conversion of 17.3% within an average of
5 h on stream compared to the reference catalyst with 25.2% aromatic
selectivity and a propane conversion of 39.7%. The ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M)
hierarchical catalyst also displayed the lowest C9+ (heavier hydrocarbons)
selectivity of 23.7% while for the reference, the selectivity was
72.7% at 5 h on stream. The average aromatic selectivity for the reference
and hierarchical catalysts within 5 h on stream followed the trend:
0.3 M > 0.4 M > 0.2 M > 0.1 M > reference ZnO/ZSM-5 while
the average
propane conversion followed a consecutive trend: reference ZnO/ZSM-5
> 0.1 M > 0.2 M > 0.3 M > 0.4 M. The reference ZnO/ZSM-5
favored mostly
C9+ and a negligible amount of the p-xylene isomer.
The best performing catalyst, ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M), had its highest selectivity
toward toluene, benzene, and m-xylene products, which
are all influenced by increased acidity and hierarchical pore geometry.
It also displayed a low amount of C9+ heavier aromatics, which are
influenced by the presence of mesopores. ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1 M) displayed
its optimum selectivity toward ethyl-benzene while ZnO/ZSM-5(0.2 M)
favored o-xylene the most. The synthesized hierarchical
catalysts exhibited very good aromatic selectivity and stability when
compared with the reference microporous catalyst.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
The
commercial ZSM-5 catalyst
(Si/Al ratio of 50, Zeolyst International), sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich,
reagent grade, 98% anhydrous pellets), zinc nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich,
98% purity), nitrogen gas (99.9% purity), and propane gas (99.9% purity)
are the reagents used in this work, whereas equipment and analytical
tools used were microfixed bed reactor (fine reactor 4100, Fine Tec),
surface area and porosimetry analyzer (V-Sorb 2800P, Gold APP), hydrogen
generator (QL-500, Global sources), XRD analyzer (Empyrean, Panalytical),
FTIR analyzer (8400-S, Shimadzu), XRF analyzer (X-Supreme 8000, Oxford
instruments), and gas chromatograph (GC) (model 910, Buck).

4.2 Alkaline Treatment of Parent ZSM-5
The parent ZSM-5
zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 50 (Zeolyst International)
obtained in the form of NH4-ZSM-5 was calcined at 550 °C
for 5 h at a heating rate of 30 °C/min to convert the NH4-ZSM-5 to H-ZSM-5. A calculated amount of the H-ZSM-5 was
dispersed in 300 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution and heated at 65 °C
for 2 h under stirring. The suspension was then cooled in an ice bath
and the solid was recovered by suction filtration. The solid was subsequently
washed with deionized water until a pH of 7 was obtained. This was
subsequently dried at 90 °C for 1 h and then ion-exchanged with
0.5 M NH4Cl at 70 °C for 3 h. The resultant mixture
was cooled, filtrated, and washed. Drying was done at 95 °C,
and then the mixture was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain
protonic hierarchical H-ZSM-5. A similar procedure was repeated using
0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M NaOH solutions.

4.3 Zinc
Impregnation on the Parent and Hierarchical
H-ZSM-5 Catalysts
Zn was impregnated onto the H-ZSM5 and
the protonic hierarchical H-ZSM-5. For this work, a ZnO loading of
2 wt % was used for all the catalyst preparation. In a typical synthesis,
Zn (NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich,
98% purity) containing 2 wt % ZnO was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized
water and subsequently introduced (dropwisely) into another beaker
containing H-ZSM-5 or hierarchical H-ZSM-5. This was then evaporated
at 70 °C under stirring until dryness and dried overnight at
95 °C. The samples were calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain
the ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts. The catalyst samples were denoted as ZnO/ZSM-5
as the reference catalyst without alkaline treatment, while hierarchical
ZSM-5 catalysts were denoted as ZnO/ZSM-5(0.1 M), ZnO/ZSM-5(0.2 M),
ZnO/ZSM-5(0.3 M), and ZnO/ZSM-5(0.4 M) with alkaline treatment with
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M NaOH concentrations, respectively.

4.4 Catalyst Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was performed to determine the structural properties of the
samples and the patterns were recorded with an Empyrean diffractometer
system using Cu Kα radiation (λkα1 =
1.540598 Å, 45 kV, and 40 mA). Each sample was scanned over a
range of 4° to 80° (2θ) and a step size of 0.026261°.
Analysis was carried out using HighScore Plus analysis software by
Panalytical while the elemental compositions of the respective catalysts
were analyzed using an X-Supreme 8000 XRF analyzer by Oxford Instruments.

The N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were
conducted on a V-Sorb 2800P surface area and porosity analyzer (V-Sorb
2800P, Gold APP) at −196 °C. Prior to the analysis, all
the samples were degassed under vacuum at 250 °C for 9 h. The
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model was used to calculate
the total surface areas, which were derived within the relative pressure
(p/p0) range of 0.0731–0.2383.
The micropore volume and micropore and mesopore surface areas were
derived from the t-plot. The pore size distribution
was calculated by the BJH method applied to the adsorption branch
of the isotherm.

Transmission FTIR spectra of lattice vibration
were recorded in
the 400–4000 cm–1 range at 2 cm–1 resolution, averaging 10 scans, using a Shimadzu FTIR spectrometer
(8400S) with IR solution software, while for the pyridine-FTIR, the
samples were weighed in crucibles (about 25 mg each) and degassed
in an oven at 250 °C for 2 h. After degassing, the samples were
placed in a desiccator containing pyridine in a Petri dish. The desiccator
was vacuumed continuously using a vacuum pump for an hour before the
samples were taken for FTIR analysis. Transmission FTIR spectra of
adsorbed pyridine were also recorded using a Shimadzu FTIR spectrometer
(8400S) to determine the nature of acid sites (Bro̷nsted and
Lewis acid sites).

4.5 Catalyst Performance Test
Catalytic
activity tests were carried out in a fixed bed stainless steel microreactor
(4100, FINETEC Instruments) at 540 °C, atmospheric pressure,
weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1200 mL/g h, and propane-to-nitrogen
ratio of 1 to 2. A total of 1 g of a catalyst, comprising of 0.5 g
of zeolite and 0.5 g of powdered glass bead, was loaded into the reactor
with a diameter of 9 mm and length of 64 mm. Initially, nitrogen was
fed into the reactor at ambient temperature flowing at a rate of 20
mL/min and preheated gradually to a reaction temperature of 540 °C.
The feed (consisting of 33 wt % propane and 67 wt % nitrogen) was
passed into the catalyst bed at a flow rate of 60 mL/min after being
preheated to the reaction temperature. The experimental setup is shown
in Figure 8. The
gaseous and liquid products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph
(model 910 by Bulk) equipped with a flame-ionized detector (FID) and
a (Restek MXT-1) column. The TCD was equipped with (molecular sieve
13X and Hayesep D) columns.

The propane conversion xpropane and product selectivity Si were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 while a schematic drawing
of the reactor setup is shown in Figure 8 1   2
