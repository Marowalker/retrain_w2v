The objective of
this work was to develop rituximab (RTX)-modified
polymeric micelles for targeting of B-cell lymphoma cells, through
postinsertion of RTX-poly(ethylene glycol)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (RTX-PEG-DSPE) into methoxy
poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEO-PCL) or methoxy
poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(ε-benzylcarboxylate-ε-caprolactone)
(PEO-PBCL) micelles. Mixed micelles were made traceable by introducing
Cy5.5 to RTX and conjugating Cy3 to propargyl moiety, end-capped PCL
or PBCL. Successful adaptation of the postinsertion method for the
formation of immunomicelles was evidenced by measurement of RTX levels
on the micellar surface, purified from free RTX by size exclusion
chromatography, using microBSA assay. A change in the micellar diameter,
from 50–70 nm for PEO-PCL and PEO-PBCL micelles and 20 nm for
PEG-DSPE micelles, to 80–95 nm for the mixed micellar population
as well as the critical micellar concentration of mixed micelles provided
further proof for the success of the postinsertion method applied
here. Mixed micelles containing PCL or PBCL with a degree of polymerization
of 22 (PCL22 and PBCL22) were thermodynamically
and kinetically more stable than those with PCL15. Accordingly,
RTX micelles containing PCL22 or PBCL22 showed
a higher percentage of Cy3+/Cy5.5+ cell population
in CD20+ KG-15 cells, than those with PCL15.
The percentage of Cy3+/Cy5.5+ cell population
drastically reduced in the presence of competing RTX for micelles
containing PCL22 or PBCL22 cores, indicating
the superiority of these structures for active targeting of CD20+ cells. No significant difference in the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel
in RTX-micelles versus plain ones was observed, reflecting the noninternalizing
function of CD20. The results show that traceable mixed micelles prepared
through postinsertion of RTX-PEG-DSPE to PEO-PCL22 or PEO-PBCL22 micelles can be used for targeting and/or imaging of CD20+ B cell lymphoma cells. The postinsertion method can be adopted
to prepare other PEO-poly(ester)-based immunomicelles for active targeting
of other diseased cells.

==== Body
Introduction
Lymphoma can be defined
as neoplasm of lymphoid origin, with more
than 25 different histological subtypes. B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
(NHL), which accounts for more than 90% of all adult cases of lymphoma,
is CD20 positive.1,2 Conventional chemotherapy regimen
used in lymphoma usually consists of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin
(DOX), vincristine, prednisone (CHOP).3 The survival of a patient with aggressive lymphoma is reported to
be less than 50%, which urges the need for new therapies.4

The introduction of rituximab (RTX), a
chimeric anti CD20 monoclonal
antibody, has changed the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Rituximab
was first tested as a single agent in the treatment of NHL in 1997,
with limited success.5 Clinical studies
over the years have shown the huge impact of adding RTX to the conventional
chemotherapy regime in NHL therapy.5 For
instance, a randomized study (399 patients) conducted by 86 centers
in France, Belgium, and Switzerland showed a significantly higher
rate of complete remission in patients receiving RTX along with CHOP
(76 vs 63%; P = 0.005). The median following the
survival rate for 2 years was also significantly improved (57 vs 38%; P = 0.001).6 Another study showed
a significant improvement in the event free survival (42% for RTX
with CHOP vs 25% for CHOP alone; P < 0.0001).7

In search for the development of more effective
and less toxic
drugs for NHL, targeting of NHL cells using CD20 monoclonal antibody
radio-immunoconjugates has been pursued.8,9 This included
ibritumomab tiuxetan, a yttrium 90–conjugated monoclonal antibody
to CD20, which has shown an overall response rate of 80% compared
with 56% for RTX in clinical studies (P = 0.002),
perhaps by locating the radiopharmaceutical in close proximity of
the malignant NHL cells.10 Application
of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)s using monoclonal antibodies (mAb)s
against CD20 has not been explored due to the noninternalizing nature
of CD20, which will limit the success of this approach. Instead, internalized
antigens such as CD19 and CD22 were targeted for this purpose.11−13

An alternative approach for targeted drug/radiophamaceutical
delivery
to NHL is the use of nanodelivery systems modified on their surface
with mAbs against NHL antigens. In this approach, the nanocarrier
can physically load several moles of drug or radiochemical inside,
carry the drug toward the target cells, and then release it either
in the vicinity of malignant cells or inside the cells following carrier
internalization.14 This approach has several
advantages over the use of ADCs or radio-immunoconjugates: (a) it
can take advantage of the physical barrier provided by the nanocarrier
against drug distribution and toxicity in normal organs; (b) it can
lead to enhanced anticancer effects for the incorporated drug even
using noninternalizing antigens, including CD20, for drug targeting;
(c) it can increase the ratio of the delivered drug per mAb in the
system; and finally (d) it can be used for the delivery of drug combinations.

The development of RTX-modified liposomes and nanoparticles has
been pursued in previous studies showing favorable results. For instance,
Wu et al. have studied the effect of adriamycin-containing liposomes
modified on their surface with a fab fragment of RTX in NHL xeno-transplant
in SCID mice and showed a significant reduction in tumor burden in
animals treated with this formulation compared with plain liposomes
carrying adriamycin or free drug.15 In
another study, Zhou et al. prepared mesoporous silica nanoparticles
decorated with RTX and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX). They have also
observed significant inhibition of tumor growth for nanocarriers of
DOX modified with RTX on their surface compared with plain nanoparticles
and free DOX in a Raji lymphoma-bearing mice model.16

Polymeric micelles (PMs) are nanodelivery systems
extensively explored
for application in cancer therapy because of their unique and favorable
properties in tumor targeting.17−20 PMs consist of amphiphilic block copolymers that
can self-assemble and form core/shell structures. In an aqueous environment,
the hydrophobic core of PMs can solubilize lipophilic drugs. In this
environment, the shell is hydrophilic, providing stealth properties,
protecting the carrier from aggregation and early uptake by phagocytic
cells. Development of antibody-modified polymeric micelles has been
mostly conducted using poly(ethylene glycol)-phospholipid (PEG-PL)
micelles, which are known to have suboptimal stability for tumor targeting.21,22 Few studies have reported on the development of other classes of
polymeric micelles, including poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(caprolactone)
(PEO-PCL), modified on their surface with antibodies through maleimide
functional groups on the PEO end.23

The objective of this study was to develop an easy method for the
preparation of mAb-modified poly(ester)-based micelles of different
structures. For this purpose, we explored postinsertion of RTX-PEG-PLs
into PEO-poly(ester) micellar structures. In this context, RTX or
its Cy5.5 conjugated counterpart were chemically linked to commercially
available 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[succinimidyl (polyethylene glycol)] (NHS-PEG-DSPE). The
Cy5.5-labeled RTX-PEG-DSPE was then mixed with either Cy3-conjugated
methoxy poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(α-propargylcarboxylate-ε-caprolactone)(PEO-PCL-PPrCL-Cy3)
with different PCL chain lengths (15 or 22 PCL degree of polymerization
(DP)) or Cy3-conjugated methoxy poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(α-benzylcarboxylate-ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(α-propargylcarboxylate-ε-caprolactone) (PEO-PBCL-PPrCL-Cy3)
(22 PBCL DP). The formation of mixed micelles, thermodynamic and kinetic
stability of mixed micelles, as well as preferential uptake of micelles
by CD20 positive and negative cells were then evaluated. Finally,
the capacity of different mixed micelles for loading, release, and
in vitro delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) to CD20 positive versus CD20
negative cells was assessed. The results showed the success of the
postinsertion method in the formation of traceable mAb-modified PEO-poly(ester)s
mixed micelles and shed light on the higher stability of mixed micelles
containing PCL22 and particularly those with PBCL22 leading to improved targeting of CD20 positive cells by these structures.

Results
Characterization
of Synthesized Block Copolymers and Their Micelles
The characteristics
of prepared block copolymers and the associated
micelles are summarized in Table 1. All micelles showed critical micelle concentration
(CMC)s in the μg/mL range (Table 1). The CMC of MM-PCL22 and MM-PBCL22 was higher than that of the micelles prepared from individual PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4 or PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4 block copolymers. However, it
was significantly lower than the CMC of micelles prepared from NHS-PEG-DSPE.
Among the prepared mixed micelles, MM-PBCL22 micelles had
the lowest CMC (12.3 μg/mL), which indicates that these mixed
micelles are the most thermodynamically stable ones. On the other
hand, the MM-PCL15 micelles showed a high CMC around 74.9
μg/mL.

g The data for mixed micelles are
statistically different from their counterpart micelles prepared from

The Z average diameter of the self-assembled structures was below
100 nm and they showed a relatively narrow polydispersity index. To
confirm the successful formation of mixed micelles, the size of a
micelle formed from individual block copolymers, i.e., PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4, PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4, PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4, or NHS-PEG-DSPE, was measured separately before mixing.
After mixing, the size of PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4/NHS-PEG-DSPE, PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4/NHS-PEG-DSPE, or PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4/NHS-PEG-DSPE pairs was also measured at different incubation
time intervals. For mixed micelle samples, at time zero, two peaks
reflecting the size of micelles from each individual block copolymer
appeared. As the incubation continued for 24 h, only one peak was
observed. The average diameter of mixed micelles measured at this
time point was shown to be significantly larger than the average diameter
of micelles from individual polymers, as shown in Table 1. Moreover, the average diameter
of RTX-modified mixed micelles was between 93 and 110 nm compared
with average diameters of 78–93 nm for their counterparts without
RTX modification.

Quantification of RTX on Micelles
The amount of RTX
conjugated to the mixed micelles was quantified by Micro Bicinchoninic
Acid (BCA) protein assay. This was done after separating different
populations formed following mixing of PCL15, PCL22, or PBCL22 based block copolymers with PEG-DSPE ones,
using the Sepharose column. All 32 collected fractions from the Sepharose
column were primarily subjected to DLS measurements to identify the
average size of particles in the corresponding fraction. Thereafter,
the microBCA assay was used to identify the fractions that contained
RTX. The BCA reading was also used to quantify RTX concentration and
conjugation efficiency in the collected fractions. Combining the data
from these measurements, we found that the first 5 fractions collected
from the Sepharose column had neither micelles nor RTX (only phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)) (Table 2). This was evidenced by no absorbance in the BCA assay or reading
in the DLS. Fractions 6–11 were suggested to have RTX-conjugated
mixed micelle, because DLS measurement showed the existence of colloidal
particles at a 90–110 nm size range for these samples. Additionally,
we had a high absorbance in the BCA assay in these fractions. Fractions
12 to 14 had only the plain micelles, which was implicated by the
absence of BCA response and a reading in the DLS similar to the size
identified for plain micelles (from 45 to 65 nm). Fractions 15–16,
on the other hand, were responsive to BCA assay and showed a size
similar to that identified for RTX-PEG-DSPE micelles (around 30 nm).
Fractions 17–28 most likely included a mixture of the free
antibody and RTX-PEG-DSPE/NHS-PEG-DSPE unimers. Fractions 28–32
showed no reading by DLS and no absorbance by the BCA assay. The high
polydispersity index and average diameter recorded for fraction 17–22,
may be attributed to the aggregation of free RTX under experimental
conditions.

Kinetic Stability of Polymeric Micelles
The kinetic
stability of micelles was studied by DLS after their incubation with
sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), which acts as a destabilizing agent. Figure 1A,B shows the % intensity
of the micellar peak and its polydispersity, respectively, for PCL15, PCL22, PBCL22, NHS-PEG-DSPE, as well
as MM-PCL15, MM-PCL22, and MM-PBCL22 (descriptions in Table 1) over time in the presence of SDS. As shown in the figure,
NHS-PEG-DSPE showed a dramatic drop in the signal intensity of the
micellar peak immediately after incubation with SDS. After 2 h of
incubation, the intensity of the micellar peak was less than 5%. In
the case of PBCL22 micelles and MM-PBCL22, there
were neither a change in the intensity of the micellar peak nor the
polydispersity index (PDI) even after 24 h of incubation, which shows
that these micelles remained intact throughout incubation with SDS.
For PCL22 micelles and MM-PCL22, the signal
intensity of the micellar peak dropped around 60% after 6 h of incubation
with SDS. Their PDI also started to increase above 0.5, around the
same time. The behavior of MM-PCL15, on the other hand,
was different from that of micelles of PCL15. The PDI of
MM-PCL15 reached 1 only after 2 h, implying micellar dissociation.
For micelles of PCL15 from single block copolymer, the
PDI remained intact for upto 4 h and then increased. Overall, among
block copolymers under study, the PEO-PBCL-based micelles (from single
block copolymer or mixed) seemed to be the most stable ones, kinetically.
Individual and mixed micelles containing PCL22 were the
next kinetically stable ones.

In Vitro Cellular Association
The
RTX-modified mixed
micelles were labeled with 2 fluorescent dyes; Cy5.5 (conjugated to
RTX) and Cy3 (conjugated to the end of poly(ester) block in micelle
core) (Figures 2 and 3).

block copolymers labeled with Cy3 at the PCL end. The PEO-PBCL-PrPCL-Cy3
micelles are prepared using the same procedure.

or PEO-PBCL-PrPCL-Cy3 micelles.

Figures 4 and 5 summarize the results of flow cytometry measurements
for the association of the RTX-MM-PCL15, RTX-MM-PCL22, and RTX-MM-PBCL22 with KG-15 (CD20+) or SUP-M2 cells (CD20–). In the dot plot (Figure S1), the bottom left section represents
Cy3 and Cy5.5 negative cells, the bottom right section shows the cells
positive for Cy3 only, the top left section is cells positive for
Cy5.5 only, and the top right section shows cells double positive
for Cy3 and Cy5.5.

in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

the average percentage of Cy3/Cy5.5 positive cells ± SD. (n = 3)* denotes statistically significant (unpaired Student’s t-test P < 0.05).

As shown in Figure 4, cells treated with RTX- modified MM-PCL22 and MM-PBCL22 were mostly positive for both Cy3 and Cy5.5. This observation
suggests that these micellar systems remained intact in the media
when incubated with the cells. In addition, the association of the
RTX modified MM-PCL22 and MM-PBCL22 with KG-15
(CD20+) was 3.7- and 4.2-fold enhanced compared with their
association with SUP-M2 (CD20–) cells, respectively
(unpaired Student t-test, P <
0.05) (Figure 5). On
the other hand, for RTX-modified MM-PCL15, the vast majority
of the cells was only positive for Cy5.5 dye, which suggests that
these mixed micelles dissociated in the media and the Cy5.5-labeled
RTX-PEG-DSPE micelle is the population associating with the CD20+ cells (Figure S1).

To assess
the effect of the receptor (CD20) mediating the cellular
association of RTX-conjugated mixed micelles, a competition study
with preincubation of cells with free RTX was conducted. In this experiment,
we compared the percentage of cells that were positive for both Cy3/Cy5.5
without and with pretreatment with free RTX. The results showed a
significant reduction of the Cy3/Cy5.5 double positive cells for RTX-MM-PCL15, RTX-MM-PCL22, and RTX-MM-PBCL22 on
the KG-15 following pretreatment with free RTX (Figure 4) (unpaired Student t-test, P < 0.05). In contrast, pretreating the SUP-M2 cells
with free RTX did not change the association of the RTX-modified micelles
with the SUP-M2 cells. We investigated the effect of RTX competition
on the association of plain micelles with both KG-15 and SUP-M2 cells
by looking into the difference in the percentage of Cy3 positive cells
with and without pretreatment with free RTX. The results showed no
significant difference in the association of the plain MM-PCL15, MM-PCL22, and MM-PBCL22 micelles
upon competition with free mAb compared with those without RTX pretreatment
in both cell lines (unpaired Student t-test, P > 0.05). Pretreatment with RTX also reduced the percentage
of Cy5.5 positive KG-15 cells for RTX-PEG-DSPE micelles (P < 0.05, unpaired Students’ t teat) reflecting the competition
of free RTX for association of RTX-PEG-DSPE micelles with CD20 cells.
This difference was not seen for SUP-M2 cells (P >
0.05, unpaired Student’s test).

Characterization of PTX-Loaded
Polymeric Micelles
Solubilization
of PTX in MM-PCL15, MM-PCL22, MM-PBCL22, and its counterpart micelles from single block copolymers was examined.24 Under identical loading conditions, no significant
difference in the encapsulation efficacy between PCL15 versus
MM-PCL15, PCL22 versus MM-PCL22,
and PBCL22 versus MM-PBCL22 micelles was observed
(unpaired Student’s t-test, P > 0.05). Overall, MM-PCL22 and MM-PBCL22 showed
significantly higher encapsulation efficacy than MM-PCL15 (one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), P < 0.05)
(Table 3).

PTX Release from Polymeric Micelles
The in vitro release
profile of PTX from polymeric micelles under study is illustrated
in Figure 6. A comparison
of the release profile between MM-PCL15, MM-PCL22, MM-PBCL22 with their counterpart micelles prepared from
single corresponding PEO-poly(ester) block copolymers was conducted
by the f2 similarity factor. In addition
to the f2 factor, the unpaired Student t-test was also conducted for the purpose of point-to-point
analysis. Our results showed that MM-PCL22 significantly
slowed down the release of PTX compared with PCL22 micelles
at a 48 h time point (40.7% of PTX released from MM-PCL22 compared with 53.1% release from PCL22) (unpaired Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). On the other hand,
when comparing the release behavior at an early time point, for instance,
after 2 h, we notice that the release of PTX from MM-PCL22 (8.49%) was significantly higher than its release from PCL22 (2.2%) (Unpaired Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). However, when measuring the f2 factor, no significant difference between the release
profile of MM-PCL22 and PCL22 micelles was observed
(f2 = 52.3). In contrast, the release
of PTX from MM-PCL15 after 48 h was significantly accelerated
compered with its release from PCL15 (75.05 versus 46.86%
release for MM-PCL15 and PCL15, respectively)
(unpaired Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). The same pattern was also noticed after 2 h, where 1.2%
of PTX was released from PCL15 whereas 23.5% was released
from MM-PCL15 (Unpaired Student’s t-test, P > 0.05). When conducting the f2 factor analysis, a significant difference
between the
release profile of PTX from PCL15 and MM-PCL15 was noted (f2 = 10.9). In the case of
MM-PBCL22, there was no significant difference between
the release profile of PTX from and PBCL22 (58.1%) and
MM-PBCL22 (60.75%) at 48 h (Unpaired Student’s t-test, P > 0.05). Interestingly, when
looking at the release profile of PTX after 2 h, we see a significantly
noticeable burst release of PTX from PBCL22 (30.5%) compared
with only (6.5%) from MM-PBCL22 (Unpaired Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). Additionally, when
conducting the f2 similarity factor analysis,
a significant difference in the release profile between PBCL22 and MM-PBCL22 was shown (f2 = 38.4). Overall, by comparing the release profile of all prepared
mixed micelles, MM-PCL22 appeared to have a significantly
slower release profile, since only 14.7 and 40.7% of PTX were released
after 6 and 48 h, respectively, from this formulation while 55.78
and 75.1% were released from MM-PCL15 after 6 and 48 h,
respectively. For MM-PBCL22, 26.6 and 60.8% of PTX were
released after 6 and 48 h, respectively, making this formulation between
MM-PCL22 and MM-PCL15 in terms of PTX release.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The results of in vitro cytotoxicity
of PTX loaded in RTX-MMs versus plain MMs and free PTX against both
KG-15 and SUP-M2 cells following 24 and 72 h of incubation is illustrated
in Figure 7A,B, respectively.
This study was conducted at a concentration equivalent to 400 ng/mL
of PTX (close to IC50 of PTX in the cell lines under study). Overall,
at 24 h of incubation time, irrespective of the cell line used and
the core forming block in the mixed micellar formulations of PTX,
no significant difference between the cytotoxicity of RTX-modified
and plain micelles was observed (Unpaired Student’s t-test, P > 0.05). However, free PTX
was
significantly more cytotoxic than the micellar formulations in both
cell lines (Unpaired Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). At 72 h, for the SUP-M2 cells (CD20–), there was no significant difference between the cytotoxicity of
PTX loaded in RTX-conjugated mixed micelles and plain mixed micelles
regardless of the core-forming structure (Unpaired Student t-test P > 0.05). However, free PTX
was
found to be more cytotoxic than micellar PTX formulations (both plain
and RTX modified) (Unpaired Student t-test P < 0.05). In KG-15(CD20+) cells, free PTX
showed similar cytotoxicity to that of encapsulated PTX in both plain
and RTX-modified micelles (Unpaired Student t-test P > 0.05).

Discussion
The main objective of this research was to come
up with simple
methods for the development of traceable mAb-modified poly(ester)-based
micelles for active cancer targeting so that the fate of nanocarriers
can be easily followed in the biological systems. Our aim was to develop
methods that are (a) easy and feasible, (b) use commercially available
functional materials for mAb conjugation (c) ensure the maintenance
of a fluorescent tag with the nanocarrier, and (d) do not jeopardize
the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of developed nanocarriers
upon introduction of the fluorescent tag. For this purpose, RTX was
used as a representative clinically relevant mAb for active targeting
of CD20 positive NHL cells. In effect, post insertion of Cy5.5 tagged
RTX-PEG-DSPE into polymeric micelles composed of PEO-PCL-Cy3 or PEO-PBCL-Cy3
of different core lengths was pursued (Figures 2 and 3). Since the
Cy3 azide was chemically conjugated into the core of the micelles
and the Cy5.5 NHS ester dye was conjugated to the RTX on the distal
end of the shell of the micellar system (Figure 2), no interference between the two dyes was
expected or observed. In addition, this design will allow tracing
of the components of the mixed micelles in the cells as well as in
vivo following administration, providing clues on the micellar stability
in biological systems.

Rituximab was covalently attached to
the distal end of PEG-DSPE
micelles through the reaction of the reactive NHS ester end of NHS-PEG-DSPE
with the aliphatic free amine from the lysine of RTX to form a stable
amide bond. This reaction was found to be appropriate for our purpose
for several reasons. First, the reaction is simple and can be carried
out in aqueous media at mild conditions. The amino group of the mAb
is a good nucleophile at pH = 8, which can attack the carboxyl group
of the NHS ester of the PEG-DSPE micelles to form a stable amide bond.
Conveniently, the complementary determining region (CDR) of RTX will
not be inactivated by this reaction, since, CDR doesn’t include
any lysine.25−27 Besides, NHS-PEG-DSPE is commercially available.

For the development of Cy3-tagged micelles, we prepared PEO-PCL-PPrCL
and PEO-PBCL-PPrCL block copolymers, first. Cy3 was then conjugated
to the PPrCL end of the block polymers. Mixed micelles were then prepared
through co-incubation of RTX-modified or plain PEG-DSPE micelles with
PEO-PCL/PEO-PBCL ones. It was assumed that the PEG-phospholipids can
spontaneously insert themselves into the more stable PEO-poly(ester)
micelles to form mixed immunomicelles.28−30 The validity of this
assumption was confirmed by following the changes in the size of particles
upon co-incubation of two micellar populations that turned into one
population over time (Table 1). The level of success in the formation of stable traceable
micelles by postinsertion of RTX-PEG-DSPE into PEO-PBCL or PEO-PCLs
of different PCL lengths was further evaluated by following the kinetic
and thermodynamic stability of mixed micelles versus micelles from
their individual polymer/lipid counterparts (Figure 1). The stability of mixed micelles was also
evaluated investigating the proportion of Cy5.5/Cy3double positive
CD20+ and CD20– cells versus the proportion
of cells that were only positive for either Cy5.5 or Cy3 (Figure 4).

Previous
studies have shown a direct correlation between the hydrophobicity
of block copolymers and the thermodynamic stability of polymeric micelles
as reflected by a decrease in their CMC.31,32 Increasing the hydrophobicity of the polymer, either through elongation
of PCL chain or the introduction of more hydrophobic benzyl groups
in the core-forming block has been shown to improve the thermodynamic
and kinetic stability of micelles formed from individual block copolymers.33,34 This has been the case here for micelles prepared from individual
block copolymers and mixed micelles and reflected in the reduced CMC
of micelles (an indication of thermodynamic stability) showing higher
tendency of block copolymers for self-assembly at lower concentrations.
Hydrophobicity of block copolymers (those having longer PCLs or those
with PBCL structures) also contributed to the resistance of the micellar
structure to dissociation in the presence of SDS, implying improved
core rigidity due to hydrophobic interactions within the micellar
core. In general, mixing with PEG-DSPE appeared to lower the thermodynamic
stability (increase the CMC) of PEO-poly(ester)s under current study.
This effect was more noticeable for PEO-PCL15 than PEO-PCL22 and PEO-PBCL22 micelles, however. MM-PBCL22 was the most thermodynamically stable system among the three
mixed micelles (Table 1), which is due to its higher hydrophobicity. Mixing of PEG-DSPE
did not seem to affect the kinetic stability of PEO-PCL22 and particularly that of PEO-PBCL22 micelles, but loosened
the micellar structure for those formed from PEO-PCL15 (Figure 1).

We then
investigated the formation of mixed micelles and their
stability in cell media, by comparing the association of Cy5.5/Cy3
dye with CD20 positive versus CD20 negative cells for MM-PCL15, MM-PCL22,
and MM-PBCL22.21,35 In our work, RTX was reacted
with NHS-PEG-DSPE at a very low ratio (1:100) so that the stealth
properties provided by the PEG shell were not compromised following
RTX modification of micellar shell (Table 2).28 Despite the
low RTX density, the RTX-conjugated MM-PCL22 and MM-PBCL2 showed significantly increased association with CD20+ cells. This was evidenced by a significant increase in the
Cy5.5+/Cy3+ population for KG-15 cells treated
with RTX-micelles compared with those treated with plain MMs (Figure 4). This observation
reflects the high affinity and selectivity of RTX toward CD20 as well
as the abundant and well-exposed countenance of CD20 on the surface
of KG-15 cells.28,36,37

Among different RTX-MMs under study, RTX-MM-PCL15 showed
the lowest population of Cy5.5/Cy3+ cells (Figures 4 and 5), whereas a high population of Cy5.5+ positive cells
was observed. The latter points to the instability of MM-PCL15 and its rapid dissociation to two separate micellar populations
consisting of Cy5.5-labeled RTX-PEG-PSPE and Cy3-labeled PEO-PCL15
micelles and is in line with our earlier observation on the low kinetic
stability of these micelles. In agreement with the above observation,
pretreatment of CD20+ cells with free RTX was the most
effective in lowering the proportion of Cy5.5+/Cy3+ cells for MM-PCL22 and MM-PBCL, again reflecting the higher stability
of these micelles.

Upon PTX loading, among different mixed micellar
formulations,
MM-PCL22 showed the highest EE (Table 3) and the slowest release profile (Figure 6). These results
were also in line with our previous findings.24 With the exception of KG-15 cells at 72 h incubation time, micellar
PTX formulations under study showed lower cytotoxicity compared with
free PTX. This may be attributed to the slow release of PTX from the
micellar formulations. No significant difference between the cytotoxicity
of PTX loaded in RTX-conjugated mixed micelles following 24 or 48
h of incubation and that of plain mixed micelles was observed, irrespective
of CD20 positivity of treated cells (Figure 7). This may be a reflection of the noninternalizing
nature of CD20, where RTX-modified micelles are expected to provide
extracellular release of the loaded PTX in the vicinity of cancer
cells. Nevertheless, the conditions of the in vitro study where plain
and RTX-modified micelles are both in similar contact with cells irrespective
of their CD20 level of expression may not be a good predictor of in
vivo conditions, where more rapid wash off of plain (unmodified carriers)
from the surface of the cells can take effect.28,38 The loading level of PTX in the formulations under study was below
1%. Despite high potency of PTX, developed formulations would need
a high level of excipients to achieve clinically relavant doses in
animal models for in vivo investigations pointing to the necessity
of further optimization studies to increase drug loading levels.

Conclusions
Traceable mAb-modified polymeric micelles without jeopardizing
the functionality of the mAb and the stability of the nanocarrier
can be developed through postinsertion of fluorescently tagged mAb-PEG-DSPE
to PEO-poly(ester) micelles. A positive correlation between the hydrophobicity
of the poly(ester) core and the stability of mixed micelles was established
that led to an improved targeting efficiency for RTX-modified mixed
micelles of higher hydrophobicity in the poly(ester) core.

Synthesis of PEO-PCL and PEO-PBCL Diblock Copolymers
Methoxy poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (ε-caprolactone)
(PEO-PCL) with different DPs of the PCL block was synthesized by ring
opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone using methoxy PEO (5000
Da) as the initiator and stannous octoate as catalyst.40 Briefly, melted PEO (0.5 g) and dried ε-caprolactone
(0.285 mg or 0.170 mg) were mixed in a vial with stannous octoate.
The vials were then sealed under vacuum. The reaction was preceded
by placing the vial in the oven at 140 °C for 6 h and vortexing
every 30 min for the first 2 h. Cooling the vials at room temperature
terminated the reaction. For the PEO-PBCL block copolymer, methoxy
PEO (5000 Da) (0.5 g), α-benzylcarboxylate ε-caprolactone
(BCL) (0.545 g), and stannous octoate were used as initiator, monomer,
and catalyst, respectively, under identical reaction conditions as
described above. The product of this reaction was purified by dissolving
it in dichloromethane and then precipitation in n-hexane. The product
was then washed with n-hexane twice and dried in a vacuum oven overnight
at room temperature. The samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3) and then subjected to 1H NMR 600 MHz
(Bruker; Billerica MA) for characterization. The DP of PCL and PBCL
blocks was determined from the 1H NMR based on the peak
intensity ratio of the protons from the ethylene moiety of PEO (δ
= 3.65 ppm) to peak intensity of the proton from the methylene of
the caprolactone (δ = 4.06 ppm) considering a molecular weight
of 5000 Da for the PEO block. The DP for each block is represented
as a subscript in the abbreviated name of polymers in the manuscript.

Preparation of α-Propargyl-ε-caprolactone End-Capped
PEO-PCL and PEO-PBCL Block Copolymers
The α-propargyl-carboxylate-ε-caprolactone
(PrCL) (60 mg) was polymerized at the end of PEO114-PCL22, PEO114-PCL15 or PEO114-PBCL22 (200 mg) through reflux in dry toluene (10 mL)
for 24 h using stannous octoate as catalyst. The prepared PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4, PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4, and PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4 were purified by precipitating the solution in
n-hexane. The precipitate was collected and dried in a vacuum oven
overnight. The samples were dissolved in CDCl3 and then
subjected to 1H NMR 600 MHz (Bruker 300 AM; Billerica MA)
for characterization. The degree of polymerization of PPrCL was calculated
based on the peak intensity ratio of the protons from the ethylene
moiety of the PEO (δ = 3.65 ppm) to peak intensity of the proton
from the methylene of the propargyl (δ = 2.50 ppm), considering
a molecular weight of 5000 Da for the PEO block.

Conjugation
of Cy3 Azide to PEO-PCL-PrPCL and PEO-PBCL-PrPCL
Cy3 azide
was conjugated to the propargyl end of the PEO-PCL-PrPCL
and PEO-PBCL-PPrCL block copolymers by click chemistry (Figure 2). The reaction is copper-catalyzed
azide-alkyne cycloaddition that allowed the synthesis of 1, 4 substituted
trizole. PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4, PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4 or PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4 polymer (0.01 mM), Cy3 azide
(0.001 mM), Cu(II) TBTA (0.0001 mM), and ascorbic acid (0.0001 mM)
were added to degassed DMSO. Cu(I) is the active form of the catalyst;
however, Cu(II) was used because Cu(I) is unstable and cannot be stored;
so it is generated in situ by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) with ascorbic
acid. The TBTA complex was used to stabilize Cu(I) toward disproportionation.
The reaction was kept stirring in dark for 24 h.41 The solution was purified by dialysis against double distilled
water for 24 h changing water every hour for the first 4 h. The solution
was then centrifuged for 5 min to remove any remaining free dye. The
Cy3 conjugated polymers were then freeze-dried and stored until further
use.

Conjugation of Rituximab or Cy5.5-labeled Rituximab to the NHS-PEG-DSPE
Micelles
Rituximab (Mwt 145 KDa)
was labeled with Cy5.5 NHS ester at an applied 1:20 molar ratio (mAb:
Cy5.5). RTX contains 49 lysines in total. The NHS ester dye was reacted
with the primary amine from the antibody in PBS at slightly alkaline
media of pH = 8.3 for 4 h at room temperature in the dark to yield
a stable amide bond. The conjugate was then purified by size exclusion
chromatography on the Sepharose CL-6B column using PBS (pH 7.4) as
the mobile phase. About 40% of the lysine’s primary amines
in RTX can react with Cy5.5. Therefore, 60% of remaining primary amines
from lysine in the RTX is free for the reaction of NHS-PEG-DSPE.

Micelles were prepared from the NHS-PEG-DSPE phospholipid by cosolvent
evaporation method. Briefly, NHS-PEG-DSPE (0.001 mM) was dissolved
in acetone, followed by drop-wise addition of this solution to 2 mL
of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) while stirring. The solution was
left overnight to allow evaporation of the acetone. The RTX or Cy5.5-labeled
RTX was added to NHS-PEG-DSPE micelles at a 1:100 molar ratio. The
NHS group from the micelles was reacted with the primary amine from
the antibody at pH 8 for 4 h in PBS. The conjugate was then purified
by Sepharose CL-6B column using PBS (pH = 7.4) as the mobile phase.

Formation of Mixed Micelles by Postinsertion Method
Mixed
micelles were formed by incubating PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4-Cy3, PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4-Cy3, or PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4-Cy3 micelles with the RTX-PEG-DSPE (plain or labeled with
Cy5.5 NHS dye) at a 1:1 molar ratio in PBS for 24 h (Figure 3).

Quantification of the Conjugated
mAb on the Micelles
Mixed micelles composed of RTX-PEG-DSPE/PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4
(RTX-MM-PCL15),
RTX-PEG-DSPE/PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4 (RTX-MM-PCL22), or RTX-PEG-DSPE/PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4
(RTX-MM-PBCL22) with no dye were prepared using the method described
under the method described above. The mixed micelles were then purified
from free unconjugated RTX by passing through Sepharose column using
PBS as the mobile phase. The eluent was collected in 32 fractions
of 1 mL each, from the column. Each fraction was subjected to dynamic
light scattering (DLS) and protein quantification by Micro BCA assay
to distinguish and separate the parts containing free RTX, RTX modified
micelles, and those containing plain micelles. Micro BCA assay using
absorbance at 560 nm (by Synergy Hybrid plate reader, Winooski) was
also used to quantify the concentration of mAb in fractions containing
RTX conjugated micelles and those containing free RTX.

Micelle Size
The hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity
of PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4, PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4, PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4, and NHS-PEG-DSPE micelles and that of mixed micelles
without any conjugated dye (1 mg/mL) were measured using DLS (ZETA-Sizer
Nano. Malvern Instruments Ltd., U.K.). The analysis was performed
at a scattering angle of 173° at 25 C°.

Micelle Stability
Critical micelle concentration (CMC)
of PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4, PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4 PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4, and their mixed micelle counterparts with NHS-PEG-DSPE
(without dye or antibody) as well as NHS-PEG-DSPE micelles alone was
determined by DLS.42 Single attenuator
index was used throughout all measurements. The scattered light was
detected at an angle of 173°. Measurements were carried out in
polystyrene cells at 25 °C. Using the scattered light intensity
as a function of polymer concentration, a series of micelle solutions
(0.060–1000 μg/mL) in deionized water were prepared for
different micellar formulations. The count rate (Kcps) as a function
of the intensity of the scattered light was plotted against log concentration
of a polymer. The intersection of the two linear graphs in the sigmoidal
curve was used to determine the CMC on the x axis.

Kinetic stability was measured with DLS by mixing the micelles
formed from individual polymers and those of mixed micelles (without
dye or antibody) at a total concentration of 1 mg/mL with sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) (20 mg/mL) in a 2:1 v/v ratio. The scattered light intensity
and the PDI were measured at different incubation time intervals.43

Measuring the Cellular Association of Micelles
by Flow Cytometry
To evaluate the cellular association of
micelles, in vitro, two
different lymphoma cell lines KG-15 (CD20+) and SUP M2
(CD20–) were used. KG-15 and SUP M2 cells (1×105 per well) were suspended in the media in a 24-well plate
and incubated at 37 °C until the confluence was around 70%. The
cells were treated with the Cy5.5-labeled RTX-MM PCL15-Cy3,
RTX-MM PCL22-Cy3, or RTX MM PBCL22-Cy3 as well
as their plain (no RTX) counterparts for 4 h. A competition study
was also carried out by pretreating the cells with free RTX at a concentration
equivalent to 10 times the concentration of the conjugated antibody
on micelles, 2 h prior to the micellar treatment. After the incubation,
cells were centrifuged and washed twice with cold PBS before analysis
using a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer. The cells were gated using
forward versus side scatter to exclude debris and dead cells before
the analysis of 10 000 cells. The data were analyzed with FlowJo
cell analysis software version 10 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, Ore.) and
plotted as a Quadrant plot.

Encapsulation of PTX in Polymeric Micelles
and Their Characterization
Paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded polymeric
micelles were prepared by the
dialysis method.44 The block copolymers
(PEO114-PCL15-PPrCL4, PEO114-PCL22-PPrCL4, or PEO114-PBCL22-PPrCL4) and PTX were dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide (0.5 mL). This solution was
added to doubly distilled water (4 mL) in a drop-wise manner under
moderate stirring for 1 day, followed by organic solvent removal by
dialysis against double distilled water for another day (Spectrapor,
MW cut-off 3500 Da). The micellar solution was then centrifuged at
11 600g for 5 min to remove any free unimers
and unencapsulated PTX. The PTX-loaded PMs were than incubated with
NHS-PEG-DSPE for another day to allow the formation of mixed micelles.
An aliquot from the micellar solution was diluted with acetonitrile
allowing the micelles to break. The solution was analyzed for PTX
concentration using LC-10AD SHIMADZU HPLC system at a flow rate of
1.0 mL/min at room temperature. The detection was performed at 227
nm using a SPD-10Avp SHIMADZU UV–VIS detector. Reversed phase
chromatography was carried out with a Microsorb-MV 5μ C18-100
Å column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) with 40 μL of the sample
injected in a gradient elution using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous
solution and acetonitrile. The percent of acetonitrile was 40% at
time zero and increased to 100% within 15 min.45 The amount of loaded PTX was measured and used to calculate
PTX encapsulation efficiency and loading as described in the following
equations    

Release of PTX from Polymeric Micelles
Release of PTX
from MM-PCL15, MM-PCL22, or MM-PBCL22 and micelles prepared from individual PEO-PCLs or PEO-PBCL or PEG-DSPE
polymer was determined in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The micellar solution (3 mL) was transferred
into a dialysis bag (Spectrapor, MW cut-off 3500 Da) and placed into
500 mL of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 10% FBS. The release
study was performed at 37 °C in a Julabo SW 22 shaking water
bath (Germany). At selected time intervals, the whole release media
has been replaced with a fresh one and aliquots of 200 μL were
withdrawn from the inside of the dialysis bag for HPLC analysis and
replaced with double distilled water. The amount of PTX released was
calculated by subtracting the amount of PTX remaining in the dialysis
bag from the initial amount of PTX. The release profiles were compared
using the similarity factor, f2, and the
profiles were considered significantly different if f2 < 50.  where n is the sampling
number
and Rj and Tj are the percent released of the reference and test
formulations at each time point “j”.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study
The cytotoxicity of free
PTX and PTX encapsulated in RTX-MM PCL15, RTX-MM PCL22, or RTX-MM PBCL22 and their plain counterparts
(without RTX modification) against 2 different cell lines (KG-15 and
SUP-M2) was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% P/S (Penicillin and Streptomycin) antibiotics
and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a tissue culture
incubator. Growth media containing 5000 cells was placed in each well
of a 96-well plate and incubated until the confluence was around 50%.
PTX-loaded micellar solutions, free PTX, and empty micelles at different
concentrations were incubated with the cells for 24 or 72 h. MTT solution
(5 mg/mL) was added to each well, and the plates were then incubated
for another 4 h. The plates were centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min, and the media was aspirated and replaced by DMSO to
dissolve the formazan crystals. The cell viability was detected by
measuring the optical absorbance at 570 nm using a Synergy Hybrid
plate reader (Winooski). The mean absorbance of each treatment was
determined and converted to the percentage of viable cells relative
to the control.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed
using either unpaired Student’s t-test or
one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test analysis, as indicated in the text.
The significance level (α) was set at 0.05. For nonlinear regression
analysis, Graphpad prism was used (version 7.00, Graphpad Software
Inc., La Jolla, CA). All experiments were conducted in triplicate
unless mentioned otherwise. In tables or graphs, data points are represented
as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
