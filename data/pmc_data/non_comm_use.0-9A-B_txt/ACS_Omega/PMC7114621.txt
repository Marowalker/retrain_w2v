Nanosized
mesoporous CuMgAl ternary oxide catalysts were prepared
by thermal decomposition of CuMgAl-layered double hydroxides at 500
°C with nominal Cu/Mg/Al ratios of 1:1:1 (Cu-LDH-I), 1.5:0.5:1
(Cu-LDH-II), and 2:0:1 (Cu-LDH-III). The synthesized catalysts were
characterized by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
CO2-TPD, and N2 physisorption analysis techniques.
The catalytic activity of the synthesized materials was investigated
for the Henry reaction between nitromethane and numerous aldehyde
derivatives under ultrasonic irradiation. The three CuMgAl ternary
oxide catalysts exhibited a high catalytic activity, forming nitro
alcohol products with 100% atom economy. The CuMgAl-I catalyst derived
from Cu-LDH-I offered high turnover frequencies (TOFs in the synthesis
of all of the nitro alcohols in shorter reaction times). The superior
catalytic activity of the CuMgAl-I sample is attributed to the synergistic
effect between the physicochemical properties of the catalysts and
ultrasonic irradiation. The HRTEM analysis of the used CuMgAl-I catalyst
revealed the evidence for the cavitation collapse, which causes localized
deformation and surface erosion. Moreover, the synthesized catalysts
also exhibited robust sustainable activity that resisted deactivation
over repeated usage. The present example of ultrasonic-assisted catalyzed
organic synthesis represents a novel strategy for the solvent-free
green synthesis of nitro-alcohols by the Henry reaction with 100%
atom economy.

1 Introduction
The
Henry reaction continues to attract attention in synthetic
organic chemistry research.1−3 With the development of suitable
chiral catalysts, the reaction was established as a viable approach
in asymmetric organic molecules synthesis, particularly in the field
of pharmaceuticals and experimental therapeutics, in which the biological
activities of compounds depend on their relative chirality.2 Traditional approaches for C–C coupling
in the Henry reaction involving soluble inorganic bases such as alkali-metal/alkaline-earth-metal
hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, alkoxides, ethoxides, and organic
bases such as primary, secondary, and tertiary amines frequently produce
dehydration products.1 Moreover, control
of the basicity of the reaction medium is vital to obtain higher yields
of β-nitro alcohols. However, the reported methodologies in
the literature suffer from the drawback of the production of moderate
yields of alcohols over long reaction times.2,3

Stoichiometric organic synthetic methods, which have largely been
applied so far, give rise to large quantities of inorganic salts as
byproducts, disposal of which has serious consequences in the environment.4 The homogeneous catalytic procedures described
in the literature have many drawbacks, such as the removal of waste
and the difficulty in recovering the catalyst from the products. Potentially,
many byproducts can be formed during the selective synthesis of 2-nitroalkanols,
such as aldol olefins and their polymers and Cannizzaro products,
depending on the nature of the base.5 The
Henry reaction has undergone significant developments, for example,
silyl nitronates have been used in the presence of fluoride ions or
alternatively α,α-doubly deprotonated primary nitroalkanes.6 These reactions are valued in the stereo-selective
synthesis of vicinal amino alcohols, but are performed under severe
conditions that reduce the diastereoselectivity of the reactions with
aromatic aldehydes. Therefore, to achieve better yields and diastereoselectivity
in the synthesis of 2-nitro alcohols, it is vital to investigate the
use of heterogeneous catalysts with basic sites.7

Although there have been outstanding advances in
the development
of heterogeneous catalysts for the Henry reaction,8,9 the
development of an environmentally friendly process and a robust environmentally
benign catalyst to synthesize novel Henry reaction products remains
a challenge. Great progress has been made in the development of mesoporous
solid bases in the last decade.10 They
are extremely desirable in green catalytic processes owing to their
advantages, including accelerated mass transfer, negligible corrosion,
and easy separation. In addition to their widespread applications
in the catalytic synthesis of biologically active organic molecules
and fine chemicals, mesoporous solid bases have also been used as
catalysts in the field of energy and environmental research.11 Nanosized metal oxides behave efficiently as
they have unique features such as high specific surface area, electric
conductivity, and thermal stability. The utilization of nanosized
mesoporous solid-base catalysts is an alternative to the classical
environmentally unfriendly homogeneous catalysts.

Metal oxides
synthesized from hydrotalcite-like structures are
considered as nanosized mesoporous solid-base catalysts, which have
unique features with respect to crystallite size, morphology, and
surface area, as well as high catalytic efficiency in various catalytic
reactions.12,13 For example, in the last decade,
CuO/Al2O3 obtained from hydrotalcites has been
considered an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of alcohols.14 Furthermore, MgO has strong Lewis basic sites
due to the presence of O2– ions and has been used
as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkyl ketones.15

Ultrasound irradiation has been proven
to be an important tool
in the arsenal of “green chemistry.”16−18 The utilization
of ultrasound irradiation has become a common practice to overcome
the disadvantages such as longer reaction times, unsatisfactory yields,
usage of expensive reagents, and operation of reactions under high
temperatures, and is commonly termed “sonochemistry.”
In the present work, three nanosized mesoporous CuO/MgAlOx catalysts, CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III,
have been prepared from CuMgAl-layered double hydroxides, CuLDH-I,
CuLDH-II, and CuLDH-III catalysts were employed for the Henry reaction
between nitromethane and a variety of benzaldehydes assisted by ultrasound
irradiation. The aim of this study was to synthesize alcohols with
100% atom economy and high turnover frequencies (TOFs). A thorough
characterization of catalysts was also performed to understand the
relationship between the physicochemical properties of the catalysts
and their catalytic functionality.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Composition by
Inductively Coupled
Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)
The ICP-AES
analysis of the Cu-LDH precursor samples was carried out to determine
their chemical composition. The Cu/Mg/Al molar ratios in the three
solids are presented in Table 1, and are very close to the molar compositions used in the
synthesis of the CuMgAl-layered double hydroxides. These results confirm
the efficacy of the preparation procedure used in the present work.

Table 1 Chemical Composition of As-Synthesized
Cu-LDH Precursors
 	CuLDH-I	CuLDH-II	CuLDH-III	
Cu/Al	0.95	1.40	1.90	
Mg/Al	0.97	0.57	 	
Cu + Mg/Al	1.92	1.96	1.88	
2.2 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD)
The powder
XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CuLDH precursor samples are shown
in Figure 1A. The diffraction
patterns reveal the typical crystalline phase of a carbonate-containing
layered double hydroxide phase (JCPDS 22-700).19 The powder XRD (PXRD) patterns of three samples show sharp
and intense diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11, 23, and 34° corresponding
to (003), (006), and (009) reflections and broad diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 39, 47, and 56° associated with (015) and (018)
reflections, respectively. However, a poorly crystalline malachite
phase [Cu2(OH)2CO3, JCPDS 10-0399]
was also detected in the PXRD pattern of the CuLDH-III sample, which
is mainly due to the high copper content in the material.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of (A) as-synthesized CuLDH precursor samples and
(B) calcined CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III catalysts.

Figure 1B shows
the PXRD patterns of the CuLDH samples calcined at 500 °C for
8 h. The formation of metal oxide of the predominant metallic cation
was observed after thermal decomposition of layered double hydroxide
below 700 °C.20 In the case of CuMgAl-I
and CuMgAl-II samples, crystalline CuO phase (JCPD 01-078-0428) was
observed along with the MgO periclase structure. Upon calcination,
the CuMgAl-III sample, which is composed of the layered double hydroxide
and malachite phases, yielded highly crystalline CuO and poorly crystalline
γ-Al2O3 phases.21 The formation of CuO phase at low temperature can be ascribed to
the well-known Jahn–Teller effect of copper ions22 and their behavior inside brucite-like layers.23 The crystallite size of the CuO phase, determined
by using the Debye–Scherrer equation, was calculated to be
around 18, 21, and 25 nm for CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III samples,
respectively. The gradual increase in CuO crystallite size can be
attributed to the precipitation of copper particles within the LDH
layers resulting in grain growth of platelets of the Cu-LDH samples,24 which in turn results in the formation of highly
crystalline CuO phase after calcination in air at 500 °C.

Relatively intense XRD reflections due to γ-Al2O3 appeared in the CuMgAl-III sample, while CuMgAl-I and
CuMgAl-II samples have not shown these reflections. This is mainly
due to the Cu, Mg, and Al composition of the samples. The Cu/Mg/Al
ratio for CuMgAl-III is 2:0:1, while it is 1:1:1 and 1.5:0.5:1 for
CuMgAl-I and CuMgAl-II samples, respectively. The CuMgAl-III sample
does not contain any Mg; it contains only Cu and Al. The absence of
Mg in the CuMgAl-III sample could be the reason for the dominance
of γ-Al2O3 reflections. It is also well
known that Al2O3 is present in the γ phase
structure at a relatively low temperature.25 The presence of MgO could suppress the formation of well-crystalline
Al2O3 phase, which could be attributed to the
more dominant appearance of the periclase structure than the amorphous-like
structure of Al2O3 at 500 °C.

2.3 Morphology Studies by Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)
The SEM images for the dried Cu-LDH precursors and calcined CuMgAl
ternary oxide samples are shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively. The SEM images of the LDH precursor samples
clearly reveal that the LDH precursor materials form platelike agglomerated
particles. The morphology of the LDH material was changed with an
increase of Cu content or a decrease of the Mg content in LDH precursors.
Most of the particles in the CuMgAl-III sample lost the best-defined
platelet structure, and the platelet size decreased upon an increase
of Cu inclusion. The calcined CuMgAl-I sample is composed of aggregated
nanoparticles with undefined spongelike morphology. The morphology
of the CuMgAl-II sample is very similar to that of the CuMgAl-I sample;
however, relatively large particles were formed in this sample. In
contrast, the CuMgAl-III sample shows individual isolated near-spherical-shaped
aggregated particles with a larger size (approximately 2 μm)
than in the other two samples. It is known that the decarbonation
process that takes place during the calcination of the hydrotalcite
samples is an exothermic process.26

The destruction of the LDH layer structure to form Mg–Al oxides
and the expulsion of copper oxide particles precipitated within the
layered structure resulted in the formation of macropores. The growth
of large particles of the CuLDH-III sample, which in turn resulted
in the highly crystalline CuO phase after calcination is majorly due
to high copper loading. These results are in accordance with the XRD
data. The EDX profiles of the CuMgAl catalysts are also included in
the Supporting Information of the revised
manuscript. The chemical compositions are shown in Table S1, and the CuMgAl-III sample has the highest Cu content
compared to the other two samples, as anticipated.

The HRTEM
images of the CuMgAl-I and CuMgAl-II samples (Figure 2) are composed of
small irregular sheets of Mg/Al/Cu oxides, which could be beneficial
for a high exposure of active Cu2+ sites. The two samples
with sheetlike morphology have size ranging from 10.5 to 24.5 nm.
Large sheet particles are likely due to Mg–Al–O, whereas
smaller particles are CuO. In the HRTEM image of the CuMgAl-III sample,
several small-size CuO nanoparticles are clearly visible, while large
sheets of MgO disappeared. The images clearly exhibit that lattice
fringes correspond to the “d” spacing
of MgO and CuO. The HRTEM images of CuMgAl-1 and CuMgAl-II samples
exhibited particles with lattice fringes by a distance of 0.243 nm,
which could be attributed to the (111) plane of the cubic MgO phase.
The lattice fringes of CuO particles, which could be confirmed by
the high crystalline nature with a d-spacing of 0.254
nm, belong to the lattice plane of (111).27 The particle size distribution of CuO particles in the CuMgAl-III
sample (Figure S3) was calculated from
the HRTEM results, and the average particle size is about 13–15
nm.

Figure 2 HRTEM images of calcined CuMgAl samples.

2.4 N2 Physisorption Studies
The
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained
at −196 °C for all of the calcined samples are shown in Figure 3A. The CuMgAl-I sample
exhibited type-IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loop, which is characteristic
of the presence of slitlike mesopores.28 The CuMgAl-II and CuMgAl-III samples show type-II isotherms with
a clear H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification.29

Figure 3 (A) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
and (B)
pore size distribution patterns of ternary CuMgAl oxide samples.

The H3 hysteresis loops exhibited a delayed condensation
in the
adsorption branch of the isotherm and showed no limiting adsorption
at high P/P0 values.
The hysteresis loops differ depending on the extent of Cu/Mg substitution
in the layered hydrotalcite sheets. The hysteresis loop of the CuMgAl-III
sample, with Cu/Mg ≈ 2 is narrower than that of the CuMgAl-II
sample, with Cu/Mg ≈ 1, which indicates the possible precipitation
of crystalline copper oxide particles with a different surface area
and pore structure. The pore size distribution patterns for calcined
CuMgAl ternary oxide samples were obtained from the adsorption branch
of the isotherms by using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT)
method (Figure 3B).
A multimodal distribution in the micro-, meso-, and macrosizes was
observed for CuMgAl-II and CuMgAl-III samples, whereas a bimodal distribution
in the micro- and mesosizes is detected for the CuMgAl-I sample. The
changes in the pore size distribution could be attributed to the different
crystalline phases with different sizes.

The results from N2 adsorption–desorption measurements
are consistent with SEM images (Figure S2). Table 2 shows the
BET surface areas (SBET), total pore volumes
(Vp), and average pore sizes for all of
the calcined samples. The CuMgAl-I sample has a higher surface area
and pore volume (78 m2 g–1 and 0.210
cm3 g–1) than the CuMgAl-II (70 m2 g–1 and 0.194 cm3 g–1) and CuMgAl-III (20 m2 g–1 and 0.153
cm3 g–1) samples. The notable decrease
in the surface area with increasing copper concentration is linked
to an increase in the particle sizes of the materials, as demonstrated
by XRD and SEM analyses.

and Pore Sizes Derived from the N2 Physisorption Data of

2.5 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
To gain an insight into
the location and nature of the Cu, Mg, Al,
and O species present in CuMgAl samples, XPS studies were performed.
The deconvoluted XPS spectra of the Cu 2p, Mg 2p, Al 2p, and O 1s
core levels are shown in Figure 4A–D. The deconvoluted Cu 2p3/2 X-ray
photoelectron spectra for the CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III
samples are shown in Figure 4A. The Cu 2p3/2 peak position in the range of 933.5–933.9
eV and shape of the Cu 2p3/2 spectral lines are consistent
with the presence of CuII in the form of CuO phase.30−32 The assignment of binding energy is also corroborated by the presence
of the satellite signals at 942.2 and 943.9 eV, which are characteristic
of CuII species. The CuLMM Auger spectra for CuMgAl ternary
oxide samples are shown in Figure S4. A
minor difference was observed in the kinetic energy maximum of CuLMM
Auger photoelectron spectra of the samples. The CuMgAl-I sample showed
a kinetic energy maximum at 917.3 eV, and an increase in the Cu content
resulted in an increase of the kinetic energy (CuMgAl-II: 917.5 eV,
CuMgAl-III: 917.9 eV). Diaz-Droguett et al.33 reported that Cu2+ species have a kinetic energy of the
Auger transition at ca. 917–918 eV. These observations indicate
that the three samples possessed Cu2+ species, and the
shift in kinetic energy maximum is most likely due to the difference
in interaction between the CuO and other oxides.

Figure 4 XPS core spectra of (A)
Cu 2p (B) Mg 2p (C) Al 2p, and (D) O 1s
for calcined CuMgAl samples.

The binding energy of the Mg 2p peak (Figure 4B) appeared around 49.3 eV for both CuMgAl-I
and CuMgAl-II samples; the positions of the peaks are in accordance
with the peak of XPs for Mg2+ in MgO phase. Similarly,
the samples exhibited three different XP peaks of Al 2p at 73.2, 75.7,
and 78.4 eV corresponding to the species in the Al3+ oxidation
state. The observed results confirm that the Cu, Mg, and Al atoms
are in bonding with oxygen atoms as they remained clustered during
the thermal treatment, and these oxides might exist in the amorphous
state or very small crystallites. The existence of a combination between
Mg, Al, and Cu and oxygen atoms is also proved by the O 1s spectra
shown in Figure 4D.
The O 1s spectra of the samples showed two peaks; the peak at 530.4
eV could be attributed to the lattice oxygen of Mg–O, Cu–O,
and Al–O species,34 while the second
peak at 531.8 eV could be associated with the oxygen-adsorbed species,
surface hydroxyl, or adsorbed water molecules.35 The ratio of the two peak intensities indicates that an
increase of the Cu content in LDH resulted in an increase of more
surface oxygen-adsorbed species. The decline in the intensity of the
peaks of XPS detected with an increase of the Cu content (principally
Mg 2p and O 1s) indicates the greater homogeneity of Cu species on
the surface. The bulk atomic composition of materials (based on the
precursor amounts) is in accordance with the surface atomic composition
(Supporting Information Table S1).

2.6 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
FT-IR
spectroscopy was used further as a tool to investigate the
structural feature of the synthesized CuO/MgAlOx catalysts (Figure 5). A broad band at 3420 cm–1 could be attributed
to the O–H vibration of the structural −OH groups. It
is interesting to observe a band at 1358 cm–1, with
a shoulder at 1530 cm–1, due to the presence of
[CO3]2– species.36 The FT-IR bands in the 500–1000 cm–1 region
could be assigned to M–O and M–OH species. It was reported
that vibrations due to Cu–O appears around 530 and 590 cm–1.37 And Cu–OH species
show bands at 469 and 720 cm–1.38 Hsu and Nacu reported a wide, strong absorption band at
430 cm–1 for the stretching vibration of Mg–O.39 It is interesting to note the γ-Al2O3 phase yields IR absorption bands around 759,
630, 652, 617, 554, and 465 cm–1.40 From all of these observations, it is possible to argue
that the FT-IR bands observed at 850, 780, 630, and 430 cm–1 in the samples are due to lattice vibrations involving the Mg2+, Cu2+, and Al3+ cations. It is interesting
to note that the intensity of the observed bands is strikingly high
in the case of the CuMgAl-I sample compared to other two samples.
An increase in the IR peak intensity is usually related to an increase
in the amount (per unit volume) of the functional group associated
with the molecular bond. A change in intensity could also be due to
some changes corresponding to the sample composition related to the
bonds, phase, crystallinity, etc. The synthesized samples clearly
possessed different phases with different elemental compositions and
sizes of the particles. The CuMgAl-I sample majorly contained nanosized
crystalline MgO and CuO phases. This could be the major reason for
the appearance of high-intense FT-IR bands corresponding to the M–O
and M–OH species in this sample.

CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III samples.

2.7 CO2 Temperature-Programmed Desorption
(CO2-TPD)
The deconvoluted CO2 desorption
profiles for the CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III samples are shown
in Figure 6. It is
generally accepted that weakly basic sites are correlated with OH
structural groups (Brønsted basic sites), moderate basic sites
are attributed to the metal-oxygen pairs in Mg–O (Lewis basic
sites), and strong basic sites are associated with low-coordination
oxygen atoms.41 The total number of basic
sites, which are ascribed to the presence of −OH and Mg–O
groups, decreased monotonically as the Cu content increased (FT-IR
spectra). As shown in Figure 6, the CuMgAl-I sample exhibited three desorption peaks corresponding
to weak, medium, and strong basic sites. The CuMgAl-II sample showed
two peaks attributed to weak and strong basic sites. In contrast,
relatively small desorption peaks centered at 150 and 200 °C
(due to weak basic sites) were observed in the case of the CuMgAl-III
sample. The quantitative data from the TPD-CO2 experiments
were obtained to understand the amount of basic sites. It is known
that the presence of MgO increases the quantity of the basic sites,
especially the medium-strength basic sites.42 The CuMgAl-III sample possessed less number of basic sites (86.3
mmol g–1) compared to CuMgAl-II (220.5 mmol g–1) and CuMgAl-I (292 mmol g–1). The
high surface area, presence of plenty of copper oxide species, and
increase in the basicity in the CuMgAl-I catalyst could offer better
catalyst activity in the Henry reaction.

of the CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III
samples.

2.8 Activity
of Catalysts in the Henry Reaction
The Henry reaction is
a base-catalyzed C–C bond-forming
reaction between nitroalkanes and aldehydes or ketones (Scheme 1); therefore, the catalytic
efficacies of CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III samples were investigated
for this reaction. For comparison purposes, the catalytic activities
of the bulk oxides (MgO, γ-Al2O3, and
CuO) are also tested. The reaction between nitromethane (1) and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (2a) in the presence of catalyst
was carried out under solvent-free conditions using conventional heating
and ultrasound irradiation. In each reaction, the same product, 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-nitroethan-1-ol
(3a), was obtained (as determined by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC)).

Scheme 1 Schematic of the Henry Reaction
The structure of the product 3a was elucidated by
spectroscopic and analytical methods. The IR spectrum of 3a shows a band at 3447.02 cm–1, which is a characteristic
band for the alcoholic OH group, and two bands at 1514.35 and 1339.51
cm–1 attributed to the presence of the NO2 group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a broad singlet at δ
= 5.65 ppm, which is a characteristic of proton of −OH groups,
which disappeared upon addition of D2O. The aliphatic protons
appear as a multiplet at δ = 4.48 ppm for 1-H and as a pair
of multiplets at δ = 4.60 and 4.85 ppm for 2-H protons. Additionally,
the signals of the aromatic protons appear in the aromatic region
of the spectrum. The 13C NMR spectrum shows two aliphatic
saturated carbon atoms at δ = 128.70 and 69.98 ppm for C-2 and
C-1, respectively. The results obtained from the catalytic test reactions
are presented in Table 3. The performances of all the catalysts were studied by monitoring
the formation of the product 3a. The target product was
formed with 100% conversion of reactants in the case of CuMgAl catalysts;
however, the yield of the catalysts differed considerably (Table 3).

Table 3 Catalytic Test Reaction of 1 and 2a Performed
Under Conventional and Ultrasound
Irradiation Conditions
The data in Table 3 show that all of the CuMgAl catalysts offered acceptable
yields
of the product. Among the bulk oxides, MgO exhibited considerable
yield, but other two oxides CuO and γ-Al2O3 have not shown any conversion under studied reaction conditions.
The ultrasonic-assisted catalytic reactions were completed in shorter
reaction times with higher yields of the product compared to the reactions
carried out by the conventional heating method. A discrepancy in the
catalytic performance of the catalysts existed as CuMgAl-I required
only 30 min to obtain 86% yield, whereas CuMgAl-II and CuMgAl-III
needed 45 and 65 min to obtain 75 and 71%, respectively, under conventional
heating. The CuMgAl-I catalyst offered a high turnover frequency in
the Henry reaction due to the presence of more basic sites. However,
under ultrasonic irradiation, the difference in activity between CuMgAl-I
and CuMgAl-II is small, which is probably due to the fact that these
two samples possessed majorly CuO and MgO phases. The synergy between
the copper species and surface Lewis basic sites derived from MgO
presented in the samples is responsible for the nucleophilic activity
at the oxygen atom. In addition, the physical phenomenon known as
acoustic cavitation at the solid–liquid interface under ultrasonic
irradiation is suggested to enhance the activity of a catalyst.43 And this effect might be equally contributing
to improve the activity of both CuMgAl-I and CuMgAl-II catalysts in
the Henry reaction. It was suggested that the microjet impact and
shock wave damage at the surface of a solid (catalyst), along with
the shock wave associated with the cavitation collapse, cause localized
deformation and surface erosion, which increases the size of the possible
reaction area.44 It is noteworthy that
the intensity of cavitation depends on the type of solvent and frequency
of ultrasonic waves used for the reaction. Therefore, the solvent
used to perform the ultrasonic-assisted reaction must be carefully
chosen. As a general rule, most reactions are performed in water;
however, in this methodology, nitromethane was used as a solvent.
It was found that nitromethane has a slightly high vapor pressure
than water45 and cavitation is more difficult
with a low-vapor-pressure liquid.

Recent advances in green chemistry
principles drive chemists to
strive to achieve maximum yield and also design a methodology that
maximizes the incorporation of atoms of the reactants into the desired
product (atom economy) to make reactions greener. In this context,
the determination of the atom economy is important. The atom economies
for the investigated catalysts in the Henry reaction were calculated
by eq 1(46) 1  

It was observed that
the atom economy for the reaction with CuMgAl-I
(i.e., under the best conditions) to give compound 3a is 100%. CuMgAl-I is the most efficient catalyst for the synthesis
of 2-nitro-1-(4-nitrophenyl) ethanol (3a) because it
offered the highest yields (99 and 86%) in the shortest reaction times
under both ultrasonic and conventional methods, respectively. Therefore,
CuMgAl-I was selected to explore the substrate scope of the Henry
reaction under ultrasound irradiation conditions; the results are
summarized in Table 4.

Table 4 Scope and Generality of the Henry
Reaction Under Optimum Reaction Conditions
The structures of the
isolated products 3a–j were elucidated
by IR, 1H, and 13C
NMR spectroscopy techniques. The IR spectra show a characteristic
band for the OH groups of the products 3a–j. It is clear from the data in Tables 3 and 4 that the CuMgAl-I
catalyst displays efficient activity in all of the reactions, giving
high yields in short reaction times (1–14 min). Furthermore,
only one isolable alcohol product was synthesized using the CuMgAl-I
catalyst in the reactions between nitromethane and various aldehyde
derivatives.

The CuMgAl-I catalyst represents a mixture of nanosized
CuO and
MgO phases, as evidenced by the PXRD patterns. In addition, γ-Al2O3 is usually formed in an amorphous phase in the
presence of CuO at a low calcination temperature of around 500 °C.14 The CuMgAl-I catalyst possessed a large surface
area and pore volume compared to the other two synthesized catalysts
(CuMgAl-II and CuMgAl-III). It is known that textural properties such
as surface area and pore size have a significant impact on the catalyst
performance. Results from N2 physisorption measurements
of samples indicated that a multimodal distribution in the micro-,
meso-, and macrosizes was presented in CuMgAl-II and CuMgAl-III samples,
whereas a bimodal distribution in the micro- and mesosizes is detected
for the CuMgAl-I sample. It was also known that smaller or larger
pores are not suitable for the catalysis, as larger pores could cause
the formation of larger CuO crystallite and decrease its dispersion.
The smaller pore size in the catalysts could cause diffusional limitations.
Due to the moderate particle size and pore size, CuMgAl-I could offer
better performance. The superior catalytic activity of the CuMgAl-I
sample could be attributed to the combination of synergistic effects
between the physicochemical properties of the catalysts and ultrasonic
irradiation. It is also well known that the presence of MgO and −OH
groups in the catalysts is responsible for the Lewis and Brønsted
basic sites, respectively.47 The nitro–aldol
reaction (Henry reaction) is usually carried out by adding small amounts
of bases such as ionic bases, alkali-metal hydroxides, alkoxides,
carbonates, and sources of fluoride anion (e.g., TBAF) or nonionic
organic amine. It was previously reported that the type of the base
and solvent used do not have a significant effect on the overall result
of the reaction.48 However, the presence
of a strong alkali such as aqueous NaOH could lead to the dehydration
of the nitro alcohol products to give nitroalkenes.49

In the present system, MgO acts as a base and γ-Al2O3 acts as a moderate acidic site due to the Al3+ cation, and the Cu2+ species are widely accepted
as an
active species in the Henry reaction. Therefore, the dehydration of
the nitro alcohol products could be ruled out in the studied methodology
and the catalytic selectivity toward alcohol formation is directly
related to the dispersed copper sites. The synergy between the copper
species and surface Lewis basic sites derived from MgO presented in
the samples led to the nucleophilic activity at the oxygen atom, thus
improving the activity for the Henry reaction. The TON and TOF values
were calculated and are presented in Table 5. Remarkably, high TON and TOF values were
achieved with a small amount of copper in the CuMgAl-I catalyst. On
the basis of the observed catalytic activity results, the synthesized
CuMgAl-I catalyst can be considered to be a suitable efficient catalyst
for the selective synthesis of nitro alcohol.

Different Aldehydes and Nitromethane Using CuMgAl-I Catalyst under
Ultrasonic Irradiation
2.8.1 Recycling of the Catalyst
It was
vitally important to study the stability of the CuMgAl-I catalyst
under ultrasound conditions. Therefore, the reaction between 1 and 2c was repeated six times using a recovered
catalyst. To recover the solid catalyst, it was filtered and washed
with acetone after each catalytic cycle and then dried in vacuum before
reuse. The catalytic activity was monitored for each reaction, and
the results are presented in Figure 7. The results show that there was no apparent decline
in the catalytic activity even after six runs, with the yields obtained
in the recyclability test being within experimental error.

Figure 7 Recycling of
the CuMgAl-I catalyst in the reaction between 1 and 2c.

As described previously, the superior
catalyst performance under
ultrasound irradiation may be due to the microjet impact and shock
wave damage occurring on the catalyst surface. The HRTEM analysis
is used to study the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on the catalyst
surface. The HRTEM image (Figure S5) of
the spent CuMgAl-I sample shows the presence of agglomerated particles
with very few lattice fringes, indicating that the ultrasonic waves
caused the localized deformation and surface erosion resulted in an
increased available interface for the reactions. Therefore, the HRTEM
analysis of the spent catalyst provided an evidence for enhanced TOFs
in the Henry reaction.

Based on the observed catalyst activity
and characterization results,
it is necessary to develop a proposed mechanism for this reaction
utilizing CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III catalysts. From the
FT-IR and CO2-TPD results, it is clear that CuMgAl-I and
CuMgAl-II catalysts possess Lewis basic sites as well as OH-Brønsted
basic sites, while the CuMgAl-III catalyst does not possess any basic
sites. Therefore, a plausible mechanism for the Henry reaction over
synthesized CuMgAl catalysts was suggested mainly on the copper active
sites and Lewis base centers, as presented in Figure 8. Initially, the nitromethane molecule is
coordinated to the active Cu center on the surface of catalyst forming
an intermediate. The hydrogen abstraction from the intermediate by
the Lewis base sites yields the nitronate ion, and the nucleophilic
carbon atom of the nitronate ion attacks the carbon of the carbonyl
group in the aldehyde molecule to form β-nitro-alkoxide, as
shown in Figure 8.
Finally, the protonation of β-nitro-alkoxide affords β-nitro
alcohol and catalyst, which are used for the next cycle.

reaction mechanism over CuMgAl catalysts.

3 Conclusions
The green reaction protocol
described herein offers a rapid, atom-economic,
and safe alternative to other methods for the Henry reaction to synthesize
the nitro alcohol derivatives using the heterogeneous recyclable CuMgAl
ternary oxide catalysts under ultrasonic irradiation. The CuMgAl ternary
oxide catalysts were derived by the thermal decomposition of Cu:Mg:Al
hydrotalcites with different Cu, Mg, and Al atomic ratios. The reactions
were proceeded under mild reaction conditions and offered the products
in excellent yields with 100% atom economy. The excellent catalytic
activity could be attributed to the synergistic effect between the
CuMgAl catalysts and ultrasonic irradiation. This remarkable synergistic
effect between the ultrasound irradiation and the catalyst in the
Henry reaction protocol was established according to the results obtained
from HRTEM analysis of the used catalyst sample. The analysis showed
that the presence of agglomerated particles with the cavitation collapse
causes localized deformation and surface erosion enables an increase
in the solid/liquid interface for the organic reactions. Other advantages
of the present reaction protocol include simple separation and purification
procedures. The excellent catalytic performance of the CuMgAl-I (Cu/Mg/Al
= 1:1:1) catalyst is due to the combined effects of nanosized crystallites
with a large surface area, mesoporosity, and superior basic properties,
which provide a durable sustainable catalyst that can be reused over
a long period of time.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
The following chemical reagents
were used for the synthesis of the catalysts: aluminum nitrate nonahydrate,
magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, sodium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide
(all from Sigma-Aldrich Laborchemikalien GmbH, Seelze, Germany), copper(II)
nitrate trihydrate (Fluka AG, Chemische Fabrik, CH-9470 Buchs, Switzerland),
and distilled/deionized water. The following chemical reagents were
used for the Henry reaction: nitromethane, p-nitrobenzaldehyde
(all from BDH Limited, Poole, England), m-nitrobenzaldehyde
(Koch Light Research Laboratories, Gauteng, South Africa), o-nitrobenzaldehyde, p-bromo benzaldehyde,
4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 5-bromo-3-nitrosalicylaldehyde, vanillin,
3,5-dimethoxy benzaldehde, 3,5-dibromobenzaldehde, and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde
(all from Sigma-Aldrich Laborchemikalien GmbH, Seelze, Germany).

4.2 Synthesis of the Cu-LDHs
The copper/magnesium/aluminum
layered double hydroxides (Cu-LDHs) were prepared by the co-precipitation
method. Two solutions, namely, solution A, containing the calculated
amounts of metal (Cu, Mg, and Al) nitrates, and solution B, containing
the precipitating agents NaOH and Na2CO3, were
added slowly and simultaneously by a peristatic pump to a flask containing
distilled water at 50 °C to maintain the constant pH value (at
around 10 ± 0.1). The total contents were stirred by using an
overhead stirrer to ensure rapid and efficient mixing to obtain the
precipitate. The obtained precipitate was filtered through Whatmann5
filter paper, and the resulted cake was washed with distilled water
until the residual solution pH became neutral.44 The cake was then dried in an electric oven at 80 °C
for 12 h. The theoretical Cu/Mg/Al ratios of the synthesized CuLDH
materials are 1:1:1, 1.5:0.5:1, and 2:0:1 for Cu-LDH-I, Cu-LDH-II,
and Cu-LDH-III, respectively.

4.3 Synthesis
of CuMgAl Catalysts
The
as-synthesized Cu-LDH materials were calcined in a muffle furnace
in a flow of air at 500 °C for 8 h to obtain CuMgAl catalysts.
The solids obtained from Cu-LDH-I, Cu-LDH-II, and Cu-LDH-III were
labeled as CuMgAl-I, CuMgAl-II, and CuMgAl-III, respectively.

4.4 Catalyst Characterization Methods
The chemical composition
of the samples was determined using Optima
4300 DV, PerkinElmer ICP-optical emission spectrometer. Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) studies were performed on all of the prepared solid
samples by using a Bruker diffractometer (Bruker D8 advance target).
The PXRD patterns were recorded with monochromatized Cu Kα irradiation
(λ = 1.5405 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The different crystalline
phases in each of the samples were identified by comparing the data
with those compiled by the Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction
Standards (JCPDS). The sizes of the crystallite phases were calculated
by using the Scherrer equation: D = Kλ/β cos θ, where “D” is the average crystallite size of the phase under
investigation, “K” is the Scherrer
constant (0.89), “λ” is the wavelength of the
X-ray beam used (1.5405 Å), “β” is the full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak, and “θ”
is the diffraction angle.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were carried out by using an X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (SPECS GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Prior to the analysis,
the samples were degassed under vacuum inside the load lock for 16
h. The binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C 1s) line at 284.6
eV was used for calibration, and the positions of the other peaks
were corrected according to the position of the C 1s signal. For the
measurements of high-resolution spectra, the analyzer was set to the
large-area lens mode with energy steps of 25 meV and in the Fixed
Analyzer Transmission (FAT) mode with a pass energy of 34 eV and dwell
time of 100 ms.

A JEOL JSM840A scanning electron microscope
and an FEI Tecnai F30
high-resolution transmission electron microscope were used to investigate
the morphological characteristics of the solid samples. Prior to each
measurement, the sample was placed on an aluminum block using carbon
tape. The FT-IR spectra of the samples were obtained using a Bruker
α-II FT-IR spectrometer. The CO2-TPD analysis was
performed using a CHEMBET-3000 instrument (Quantachrome). The samples
were outgassed at 100 °C (1 h) by flowing helium gas over the
sample. Then, the sample was saturated with CO2 at 120
°C for 30 min. Subsequently, the sample was treated with helium
gas to remove the physisorbed CO2 gas. Finally, the TPD
patterns of the samples were collected by ramping the sample temperature
to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

N2 physisorption experiments were carried out
at −196
°C using a NOVA 3200 e automated gas sorption system (Quantachrome)
to investigate the textural properties of the solids. Before every
measurement, the adsorbent was pretreated at 150 °C for 6 h.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation was applied
to determine the specific surface areas, and the average pore radii
were deduced from the equation 2Vp/SBET, where Vp is the total pore volume
(at P/P0 = 0.98).

4.5 Typical Procedure for the Henry Reaction
4.5.1 Conventional
Method
A mixture of
4-nitrobenzaldehyde (0.5 g), nitromethane (3 mL), and catalyst (150
mg) was heated together in a two-necked, round-bottom flask at 90
°C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (eluent:diethyl
ether/chloroform in 1:1). Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture
was cooled and the product was extracted by dissolution in hot ethanol.
The catalyst was removed by filtration and washed with alcohol prior
to drying and reuse. After evaporation of the volatile materials under
vacuum, compound 3a was recrystallized from EtOH/DMF.

4.5.2 Ultrasonic Method
A mixture of
aldehyde 2a–j (3.3 mmol), nitromethane 1a (3 mL), and the catalyst (150 mg) was added to a three-neck,
round-bottom flask, and the reaction mixture was subjected to ultrasound
irradiation for the time required to complete the reaction (Table 1). All reactions were
kept at 25–30 °C; the temperature was maintained by the
addition and removal of water from the bath (the temperature inside
the reaction vessel was 27 °C, and the reaction flask was placed
in the middle of the ultrasonicator bath to achieve effective cavitation).
The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (eluent:diethyl
ether/chloroform in 1:1). Then, the product mixture was cooled and
extracted with acetone. The catalyst was then removed by filtration,
and the products were purified by crystallization from EtOH/DMF to
afford the pure crude β-nitro-alcohols 3a–j in excellent yields.

4.6 Characterization
of the Reaction Products
All melting points were determined
by using a Barnstead International
1002 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. TLC was performed
on aluminum silica gel 60 F254 (E-Merck). The spots were detected
by UV light absorption. The IR spectra were recorded with a Thermo-Nicolet-6700
FT-IR spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker WM 400 spectrometer at 850 MHz in deuterated
chloroform (CDCl) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) using tetramethylsilane (TMS; 0.00 ppm) as internal standard.
Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm relative to the signal
for TMS as a standard, and coupling constants are given in hertz.
The reactions performed under ultrasound irradiation were carried
out in a Daihan (Wiseclean, D-40 MHz) ultrasonic bath.
