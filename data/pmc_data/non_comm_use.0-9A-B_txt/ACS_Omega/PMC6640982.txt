We first report that
a highly enantioselective C–C bond
formation reaction was achieved with liposomes in aqueous media. Alkylation
of N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester (DMGBE) with benzyl bromide was conducted in the presence
of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide micelles, resulting in a high conversion
of DMGBE but little enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of
the product. The same reaction was then carried out in 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine liposome suspensions, where
the e.e. values were high (at least 90 % (S)), indicating that the
liposome membranes can behave as the promoter of the enantioselective
reaction. Changing the type of lipid to 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to form a more ordered bilayer membrane
lowered the reaction conversion but still maintained high e.e.% , that is, >90 (S), regardless of lipid chirality.
It is indicated that multiple interactions between the DMGBE intermediate
and lipid molecules promoted the migration of the intermediate into
the interior of the membrane, whose bottom side (Si face) could be free for alkylation. These results suggest that liposomes
can promote and regulate the alkylation of amino acid derivatives.

1 Introduction
Phase-transfer
catalyst (PTC) has been developed as a powerful
tool in synthetic organic reactions. The major advantages in the use
of PTC are high yield and enantioselectivity; furthermore, PTC can
be used to synthesize both natural and artificial amino acids (Scheme 1).16,17 As an example of enantioselective alkylation of a prochiral glycine
derivative (1) (N-(diphenylmethylene)glycine tert-butyl ester (DMGBE)) and benzyl bromide (2), the designed PTCs produced both 3S(17) and 3R.16,11 In this reaction, (i)
an inorganic base (e.g., NaOH) promotes the deprotonation of 1 at the organic solvent–water interface, (ii) the
ion pair formation migrates the intermediate of 1 to
the organic phase, and (iii) alkylation is conducted (Scheme S1). Because of the poor solubilities
of 1 and PTC, the reaction requires an organic phase
(e.g., toluene, CH2Cl2).16−8 To develop a green sustainable
chemical process, metal-free, base/acid-free, and organic-solvent-free
systems are desired. However, highly selective reactions have rarely
been achieved.8,19

Scheme 1 α-Amino Acid
Synthesis Using PTC16
Self-organized nanoarchitectures (such as micelles,
vesicles, nanotubes,
etc.) are generated by noncovalent interactions between amphiphilic
molecules in aqueous media. They have attracted much attention in
various fields.1−13 It has also been reported that the interface of reverse micelles
was shown to increase the enantioselectivity of catalytic hydrogenation.27 Although there are several reports about the
asymmetric synthesis of amino acid derivatives using amphiphilic catalysts
as PTC,11,9,10 the use of
organic solvents as reaction media still needs to be studied. To construct
a hydrophobic environment in water, liposomes, spherical bilayer vesicles
containing highly ordered hydrophobic–hydrophilic interfaces,
can be utilized (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of liposome (a) and micelle (b). Comparison of the membrane
rigidity (c): so, solid-ordered phase

liposome); ld, liquid-disordered phase
(1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)
liposome).

Our previous report showed that
the pseudo-interphase of liposomes
was able to act as a platform for reactant localization.12 At the self-assembly interface, organic synthesis,
such as the Diels–Alder reaction, can be conducted without
the use of organic solvent.20−23 It is, therefore, expected that the liposome membrane
interface can also be utilized as an organic-solvent-free interface
for chemical reactions. In addition, the physicochemical properties
of membranes, in other words, the microscopic environment formed on
the liposome or micelle surfaces, can be characterized using fluorescent
probes.12,14,15 Particularly,
the lower critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of phospholipid
(<10–9 M) suggests that it possesses a relatively
rigid interface (less hydrophilic), as compared to that of the micelle
systems (CAC: ∼10–4 M) (Figure 1c). It is, therefore, expected
that the self-assembly (in aqueous media) can act like a PTC without
the use of any organic solvent.

In this study, asymmetric alkylation
of 1 with 2 was carried out in the presence
of self-assemblies (micelle
and liposome). Herein, the amphiphiles, including the quaternary ammonium
group, were employed as a component of self-assembly: phospholipid
(DOPC and DPPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium bromide (DOTAP)
for liposomes, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) for micelles
(see Figure S1 for amphiphile’s
chemical structure 3–9). Because both the reactants 1 and 2 showed quite poor solubility in water,
their localization could be limited to the interior or the surface
of the self-assembled membranes in aqueous media. This is the first
report of a metal-free and organic-solvent-free asymmetric synthesis
of α-amino acid with high enantioselectivity (Scheme 2) using the self-assembly surface
as the reaction media.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Alkylation of DMGBE with
Benzyl Bromide in
Aqueous Media
In the alkylation of 1 with 2 using PTC, inorganic bases (NaOH, KOH) have been used to
promote the deprotonation of 1.18 In the presence of amphiphilic assemblies and NaOH, the alkylation
reactions of 1 with 2 were conducted (Table 1, Figure 2). In the presence of tetrabutylammonium
hydrogensulfate (TBAH in CH2Cl2–water
solvent: entry I) and CTAB (micelle in water: entry III), product 3 was obtained with a higher conversion but small enantioselectivity
(Table 1). The values
of both conversion and enantiomeric excess (e.e.)
of the reaction with TBAH in water were very low (entry II), clearly
suggesting that the organic solvent–water interface is necessary
for this reaction. In the presence of the CTAB micelle, the hydrophobic
environment of the self-assembly can be utilized as an alternative
to organic solvent, wherein the value of e.e. was
very low (e.e.% < 10). In contrast, the reaction
conducted with the DOPC liposome resulted in a high enantioselectivity
(3S, e.e.% > 90: entry IV). Such
differences
in the values of conversion and e.e. could be provided
by the membrane structure: CTAB as the micelle and DOPC as the lipid
bilayer.

particular assembly. Independent experiments were conducted at least
three times to calculate the values of conversion and e.e.

2.2 Reaction
Site at the Membrane Interface
To estimate the possible reaction
site in the liposome, 1 and 2 were independently
incorporated into self-assemblies,
and then, the suspensions were mixed to initiate the reaction (Table 2, Figure S3). For the case of DOPC liposome, a negligible amount
of 3 was obtained, suggesting that both 1 and 2 are isolated by each membrane and the reaction
at the membrane–membrane interface hardly occurred (entry VII).
In contrast, a mixing of 1 and 2-preadsorbed
DOPC liposome resulted in 3S, indicating that the hydrophobic–hydrophilic
interface of the liposome can act as its reaction site (entry VI).
In the case of a CTAB micelle system, a mixing of 1 and 2, which were independently preadsorbed into the CTAB micelles,
successfully conducted the reaction although the e.e. value was quite low (entry V). Because of the high CAC value of
CTAB, the membrane surface of its micelle could show a dynamic nature,
wherein the CTAB molecules continuously associate and dissociate with
each other, and the entrapped reactants can then be in contact with
the micellar interface. Such a dynamic nature of the CTAB micelles
leads to racemic products as well as TBAH in organic solvent–water
systems. On the contrary, the liposome membrane itself showed an advantage
in enantioselectivity. Table 3 shows the comparison of enantioselectivity in the alkylation
of 1 with 2 in the presence of the reported
PTCs.17,11,9 As a tendency,
the PTC possessing a rigid structure shows a high enantioselectivity
(PTC-1, PTC-2, PTC-4, and PTC-5). Although self-assembled materials
are classified as soft matter, we demonstrated the enantioselective
alkylation of 1 with 2 using liposome membranes
as soft interface. A high e.e. value was obtained
at an earlier stage of the reaction in the presence of the DOPC liposome
(entry VIII). Particularly, zwitterionic DOPC assemblies showed high e.e. values, indicating that the migration of the reaction
intermediate (step (ii)) into the interior of the liposome was assisted
by its interaction with the lipid headgroup, which restricts α-carbon
of 1 attacking 2 existing in the membrane.

2.3 Evaluation of the Polar Environment Constructed
on the Membrane Surface
Liposomes (DOPC, DPPC, and DOTAP)
were found to have higher enantioselectivities than the CTAB micelle
(Table 4). The enhancement
of the reaction at the surface of the liposome membrane can be related
to the microscopic environment. Particularly, the membrane polarity,
evaluated by Laurdan,12,14,15 could be a key parameter to understand the surroundings of 1 and 2. In brief, a spectrum of Laurdan includes
multiple emission peaks depending on its surrounding, and the obtained
spectrum can be deconvoluted to understand the balance of the existing
hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments. As shown in Figure 3, one is from Laurdan embedded
in the hydrophilic area (green lines: membrane in disordered phase14) and the other is from the hydrophobic area
(blue lines: membrane in ordered phase14). DOPC contains unsaturated alkyl chains (fluid phase at r.t.15), showing the disordered phase as dominant (Figure 3a). On the other
hand, the fluorescence spectrum of DPPC (Figure 3b), which only contains saturated alkyl chains
(gel phase at r.t.15), showed that the
ordered phase was dominant. Lower GP340 values (GP340 < −0.2, Figure 3d) indicated the
presence of liquid-disordered (ld) phase,
whereas higher GP340 values (GP340 > 0.326) indicated the
presence of solid-ordered (so) phase.
Our previous report also revealed that the hydrophobic molecules could
adsorb onto the disordered-phase liposomes (e.g., DOPC liposome),12 indicating that the interaction between the
hydrophobic reactants and the liposomes was stronger with DOPC than
that with DPPC. In the presence of the DPPC liposome, the conversion
value was lower than that with other liposomes (entry XV). Unadsorbed
reactants (in aqueous phase) were less reactive in the bulk aqueous
solution (cf., entry II). The effects of the addition of CTAB and
dilauryldimetylammonium bromide (DDAB) on the membrane properties
and the phase state of the liposome were also investigated. The DOPC
liposome modified with CTAB and DDAB showed slight changes in the GP340 values, whereas the liposomes modified
with CTAB and DDAB resulted in similar values of conversion and e.e. (entries XVI and XVII). Importantly, the analysis of
Laurdan can distinguish the vesicles and micelles. The micelles show
a lower GP340 value (GP340 < −0.7), and their less hydrophobic environment
could not produce enantioselectivity. By comparing the peak area ratio
of the disordered phase (Ad) and the ordered
phase (Ao), a phase state of each self-assembly
can also be revealed. The area ratio values (Ao/Ad) of DOPC liposome, DPPC liposome,
and CTAB micelle were 0.16, 6.6, and 0.05, respectively. On
the basis of these data, an ordered phase has Ao/Ad > 2.5, a disordered phase
has 0.3 > Ao/Ad > 0.1, and a micelle phase has Ao/Ad < 0.1. DDAB, a bilayer-forming
amphiphile,24 also showed a higher conversion
but an opposite enantioselectivity.25 The GP340 value of the DDAB liposome was similar
to that of the CTAB micelle, indicating that the more polar environment
(GP340 < −0.4) of the liposome
contributed to produce 3S as the product. These results
suggest that the enantioselectivity of the reaction in the presence
of self-assemblies could be controlled by the membrane polarity.

2.4 Discussion of the Enantioselectivity of the
Reaction Mechanism in the Presence of Liposomes
According
to Kitamura et al.,11 a successful strategy
for the design of PTC involves the following components: (1) quaternary
ammonium, (2) rigid binaphthyl group, and (3) a flexible alkyl chain
(PTC-5). Particularly, flexible alkyl chains increase the polarity
around the ammonium group, which enables the enolate to access the
reaction pocket (see ref (16) and Figure S5). A series of
works by Maruoka et al. have reported the PTCs that can provide 3R.16,11,19 Considering these previous findings, it is assumed that the interaction
face of 1 (or deprotonated intermediate) with PTC is
a key to gain selectivity, and the “active” plane of
the alkylation can then be controlled.16 Considering the polarity of the carbanion intermediate of 1, it could be located at the membrane surface. In a case
study of asymmetric epoxidation, Kumar and Bhakuni reported that the
specific interactions between the lipid and the guest molecule in
liposomal configurations restrict the orientation of the guest molecule
at specific sites, which has been exploited in stereospecific synthesis.8 It is thus assumed that the controlled localization
of reactants can provide stereospecificity of the product. In our
case, one hypothesis is that the organized structure of lipid membranes
has an advantage in the preference binding of 1 (or intermediate);
thereby, the reaction face (Si face (bottom side), Re face (top side), see Scheme S1) can be restricted. The ionized lipid headgroup faces the bulk water,
whereas the hydrocarbon tails associate with the neighboring lipid
molecules in the liposome membrane. Herein, possible interaction models
for lipid molecule and 1 (carbanion) at the membrane
were considered.

2.4.1 Lipid Chirality
To verify the hypothesis, d-DPPC (enantiomer of l-DPPC) was used to form a liposome.
As a result, no difference in conversion and e.e. values was observed (Table 5). In general, a chiral selectivity is generated by the molecular
chirality of the catalyst. However, our result indicates that the
enantioselectivity of the reaction, generated by the platform (self-assembled
lipid bilayer), is independent of lipid chirality. The reaction intermediate
of 1 is expected to have a planar structure after deprotonation
of α-carbon. The possible factors to promote the enantioselective
reaction can herewith be described as follows: the quaternary ammonium
group stabilizes the anionic group of the intermediate of 1 (carbanion (α-carbon) or enolate), the hydrophobic interior
attracts the phenyl group of 1, and a hydrogen bond is
formed between the proton (δ+) at α-carbon
of the intermediate of 1 and a carbonyl group or phosphate
group. At the liposome membrane, the orientation of lipid molecules
is restricted irrelevantly to lipid chirality, revealing its lesser
contribution. To induce a chirality in product, at least a “three-point”
interaction between 1 and the lipid molecules is necessary.
Considering the laterally organized structure of the liposome, multiple
lipid molecules could contribute to a stereospecific interaction with
the intermediate. As a result, the Re face of the
intermediate of 1 can be masked with the lipid headgroup,
and then, the alkylation was conducted mainly at the Si face.

a 1 was added to 2-adsorbed
DOPC liposome suspension to initiate the reaction.

2.4.2 Phosphate
Group
Phospholipids (DOPC,
DPPC) are zwitterionic molecules, whereas DOTAP and CTAB are in the
form of alkylammonium salt in self-assembly. The effect of the phosphate
group can be discussed using the DOTAP liposome. As shown in Table 4, the DOTAP liposome, as
well as the DOPC liposome, also produced 3S with a higher e.e. value. The carbonyl group can act as a hydrogen-bond
donor; thus, the speculated interactions between 1 and
DOTAP molecules are electrostatic (at headgroup), hydrophobic (at
membrane interior), and hydrogen-bond (at carbonyl group) interactions. It
is assumed that the counterion (chloride) of the DOTAP molecule forms
an ion pair with sodium cation in the reaction step (i) and this ion
pair migrates the intermediate of 1 into the interior
of the membrane in step (ii).

2.4.3 Carbonyl
Group
DDAB, tetraalkylammonium
bromide with two C12 chains, is also known to form a vesicular (liposome)
structure.24 Interestingly, 3R was obtained as the major product in the presence of the DDAB liposome,25 whereas the DOPC/DDAB = 90:10 liposome showed
e.e. > 96% (3S). Focusing on the polar environment
of
the membrane, the characteristic of the DDAB liposome was quite similar
to that of the CTAB micelle; in contrast, the DOTAP liposome was similar
to the DOPC liposome (Figure 3). Because of the lack of carbonyl group, the lateral association
of DDAB molecules could be weaker than that of the DOTAP-type lipids;
meanwhile, the membrane could be less rigid. Although details must
be investigated for the reaction mechanism with the DDAB liposome,24 it is expected that the Re face
could be free after the interaction with the DDAB liposome.

As a summary, a supposed interaction mechanism of the reaction in
the presence of the DOPC liposome is shown in Figure 4. In this study, although an excess amount
of amphiphiles was used as compared to that of the reactants, we demonstrated
that the liposome conducted the alkylation of 1 with 2 in aqueous media (without any organic solvent) and then
obtained a high enantioselectivity.

liposome interface.

3 Conclusions
Liposomes were shown to be potentially useful
as a platform for
the asymmetric synthesis of α-amino acid derivatives. Localization
of the reactants was determined to be an important factor for regulating
the reaction and its chiral selectivity. In the liposome membrane,
a planar hydrophobic interior faces the ionized headgroup, wherein
the ion pair formation of the reactant and lipid headgroup could promote
the phase transfer of the reaction intermediate into the membrane
interior. In a general aspect, a chiral selectivity in an asymmetric
reaction is provided by a chiral environment, which is usually originated
from the chirality of catalyst. At the same time, we demonstrated
that the liposomes provided a chiral selectivity of the product independent
of the lipid chirality, suggesting that the self-assembled membrane
structure could contribute to provide a chiral environment for asymmetric
reaction in aqueous media. It is expected that the liposome membrane
systems can be utilized as a novel reaction medium for safe and clean
organic synthesis processes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
DPPC and DOPC were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipid (Alabaster, AL). CTAB, sodium hydroxide,
and benzyl bromide were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka,
Japan). DDAB, TBAH, and DMGBE were purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industries (Tokyo, Japan). All of these chemicals were used without
further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Liposomes
A chloroform
solution containing lipids was dried in a round-bottom flask by evaporation
under vacuum. The obtained lipid thin film was dissolved in chloroform
again, and the solvent was evaporated. The lipid thin film was kept
under high vacuum for at least 3 h and then hydrated with distilled
water at r.t. The liposome suspension was frozen at −80 °C
and thawed at 50 °C to enhance the transformation of small vesicles
into larger multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). This freeze–thaw
cycle was performed five times. The MLVs were used to prepare large
unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) by extruding the MLV suspension 11 times
through two layers of polycarbonate membranes with a mean pore diameter
of 100 nm using an extruding device (Liposofast; Avestin Inc., Ottawa,
Canada).

4.3 Evaluation of Membrane Polarities
Laurdan is sensitive to the polarity around the molecule itself,
and its fluorescence properties enable us to evaluate the surface
polarity of lipid membranes. The Laurdan emission spectra exhibit
a redshift caused by dielectric relaxation. These spectra were measured
with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm, and the general polarization
(GP340), the membrane polarity, was calculated
as follows  where I440 and I490 represent the fluorescence intensities of
Laurdan at 440 and 490 nm, respectively. The total concentrations
of lipid and Laurdan were 100 and 1 μM, respectively. The fluorescence
spectrum of Laurdan was deconvoluted into two spectra using
the software Peakfit (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA): one originates
from the localization of Laurdan in an ordered membrane (ordered phase)
and the other originates from the localization of Laurdan in a disordered
membrane (disordered phase). By calculating the area below the spectrum
originating from the ordered phase (Ao) and the area below the spectrum originating from the disordered
phase (Ad), the area ratio of ordered
phase to disordered phase in the actual vesicle sample (Ao/Ad) was determined.

4.4 Alkylation of DMGBE with Benzyl Bromide
DMGBE (0.3
mg, 1.0 μmol) was dissolved in pure water, and
then, the water solution was mixed with liposome suspension and NaOH
aqueous solution (10%) to obtain 1 mL of reaction solution. Benzyl
bromide (1.5 μL, 12 μmol) was finally added to initiate
the reaction (Scheme 1). The reaction solution was stirred at 500 rpm in r.t. for 24 h.
The total concentrations of DMGBE, benzyl bromide, lipid, and NaOH
were 1.0, 12, and 10 mM and 0.3 M, respectively. In
the case of surfactants (CTAB, TBAH, etc.), an aqueous solution
of the surfactant was added instead of the liposome suspension. The
total concentrations were fixed to the same values as those of the
condition of the reaction with liposomes.

4.5 HPLC
Measurements of Reaction Solution
After the reaction was
complete (24 h after the initiation of the
reaction), the product (and reactant) was extracted to the organic
solvent using the Bligh–Dyer method. In brief, 1 mL of the
reaction solution was mixed with 2 mL of methanol and 1 mL of chloroform,
resulting in a homogeneous, colorless, and transparent liquid. Then,
1 mL of chloroform and 1 mL of pure water were added to the solution
to lead to phase separation. Centrifugation was performed (1400 rpm,
5 min) using a Tabletop Centrifuge KUBOTA 5200 (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan)
to complete the phase separation process.

After the extraction,
the organic phase was moved to a round-bottom flask and chloroform
was removed by evaporation. Diethyl ether (1 mL) was added to the
flask, and 10 μL of it was taken and dissolved in 1 mL of mobile
phase for HPLC analysis (Daicel Chiralpak IA, mobile phase was hexane/2-propanol
= 99:1, flow rate = 0.5 mL/min). The HPLC analysis was done using
Waters 1515 Isocratic HPLC Pump and Waters 2489 UV/visible Detector
(Waters, Milford, MA) to evaluate the conversion of the reaction and
the e.e. The reproducibility of the reaction was good (at least n ≥ 3 for each reaction system); the errors in the
values of conversion and e.e. were less than 10% for all reactions
carried out in this study. The trial number (n) of
each reaction system is as follows: for I, II, III, and IV, n ≥ 5; for XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, and XXI, n ≥ 4; otherwise, n ≥ 3.
