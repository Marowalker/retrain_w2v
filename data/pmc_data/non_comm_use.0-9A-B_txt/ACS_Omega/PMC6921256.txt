Previous research has shown that polyhedral oligomeric
silsesquioxane (POSS) particles in silicone oil show electrorheological
(ER) activity. The effect of the number of same functional groups
attached to POSS cage structures on the ER activity of these structures
is discussed in this article. Two compounds of the octahedral geometry
(T8) of cyanopropyl POSS (cPOSS) were used for this investigation.
One of the compounds (monofunctionalized cPOSS) was commercially available,
and the other (octafunctionalized cPOSS) was synthesized. The effects
of the number of cyanopropyl functional groups attached to the inorganic
silicon–oxygen core structure of the POSS compounds on the
rheological properties are demonstrated through steady flow and oscillatory
tests. Particular attention is paid to how the number of cyano functional
groups affects the behavior of these suspensions of cPOSS compounds
in silicone oil under increasing electric field strength. The research
also contributed answers to the effects of changing the concentration
of the cPOSS particles in the suspension. The flow curve was described
by the Herschel–Bulkley model, and the yield stress values
were ascertained from the model. The dielectric characterization was
also done to support the ER response results, which showed that the
octafunctionalized compound gave a better response. The differences
in the ER properties of these compounds have also been discussed with
the tests.

Introduction
Smart materials are materials designed
so that one or more of their properties change as a result of external
stimuli. Electrorheological fluids (ER fluids) are a kind of smart
materials, which undergo a change in the properties by the application
of the electric field. They are suspensions of polarizable particles
in nonpolarizable solvents. The rheological properties of the ER fluid,
such as viscosity, stress, and shear modulus, undergo a reversible
change by orders of magnitude when an electric field is applied.3 The suspended particles in the ER fluid are polarized
by the electric field application and form chain-like structures and
instantaneously return to their original state when the field is removed.
The formation of the fibrillated structures causes an increase in
resistance to flow and develops yield stress that must be overcome
for flow to occur. ER fluids have received attention over the years
and find application in shock absorbers, clutches, dampers, actuators,
and in ER fluid-assisted polishing in semiconductors.

Diverse
particle–solvent suspension systems exhibit ER behavior. The
dispersed phase is commonly inorganic particles or organic materials,
while the dispersing phase is normally nonpolar solvents with low
conductivity. The internal parameters and factors that influence particle
polarization have been widely investigated by researchers.

ER
suspensions containing high concentrations of particles that possess
permanent dipoles show larger ER effects in suspensions than conventional
ER fluids.1,3 Several systems have been used to show this
phenomenon. In their comparison of electrorheological performance
between urea-coated and graphene oxide-wrapped TiO2 nanoparticles
and bare TiO2 nanoparticles, Dong et al.5 showed that bare titanium nanoparticles had improved ER
characteristics as a result of having more polar functional groups
attached to it as shell materials. Specifically, for the graphene
oxide (GO), there are lots of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on the
basal planes and its edges. These functional groups enhance the electrostatic
interaction between the particles, reduce its conductivity, and influence
the graphene oxide to become negatively charged. Kawai and Ikazaki10 studied the electrorheology of three fluids
consisting of dispersoids with different functional groups and the
same alkyl chain of C16H33, which are dispersed
in dimethyl silicone oil. The functional groups are the −OH
from n-hexadecanol, −COOH from n-heptadecanoic acid, and −CN from n-heptadecanonitrile.
They introduced temperature as a variable for their experiments and
monitored the ER effect and complex dielectric constants of the three
different compounds as they were heated to their melting points and
past it. Through crystallography and infrared spectroscopies, they
made observations in the structural changes of these compounds, and
after the experiments, they concluded that the ER effect of hexadecanol
is highest and that of the heptadecanonitrile is lowest. Cheng et
al.2 synthesized uniform titania microspheres
with an enhanced ER effect using an acetic acid-assisted sol–gel
method for synthesis. The enhancement in ER properties is attributed
to the combined effect of the increased polar molecule content and
reduced particle size. Plachy et al.6 designed
an ER suspension (urea-coated lithium titanate nanoparticle-based
suspension), which has higher yield stress in two orders of magnitude
in comparison to a bare lithium titanate nanoparticle/silicone oil
combination. The ER behavior of the bare lithium titanate nanoparticles
was improved by coating with urea.

The main attraction for polyhedral
oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) variants is that they offer multiple
functionalities because of their three-dimensional frameworks, which
make it possible to add different functional groups or to use them
as fillers for different end results.16 POSS has been used as fillers to mitigate particle sedimentation,
which is a major drawback in ER application. Li et al.17 adjusted the hydrophilicity of graphene oxide
(GO) nanosheets so that it can be compatible with silicone oil and
overcome phase separation or sedimentation. This has been achieved
by decorating the active amine groups of octameric aminopropylisobutyl
POSS with the oxygen-containing groups of GO, thereby preventing the
reaggregation of GO and reducing the total thickness of the final
POSS-GO structure. High yield stress ER fluid that are comparable
to that of conventional ER fluids has also been identified by McIntyre
et al.3 in a sulfonated-POSS/PDMS ER fluid
system.

There are limited studies on the electrorheology of
POSS and the effect of different or number of functional groups attached
to the core of the POSS. McIntyre et al.3 discovered that less than 10% (7% wt) by weight sulfonated polyhedral
silsesquioxane cage structures (s-POSS or TSAE-POSS, which means the
Tri sulfonic acid ethyl POSS) in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS or silicone
oil) showed an increase of viscosity by a factor of 1 × 102 for an electric field strength of 2 kV/mm. This was in contrast
to another POSS particle known as isotropic octa-isobutyl POSS, which
exhibited virtually no ER behavior at the same weight percentage.
Even when increased to 10% wt, the octa-isobutyl POSS particles still
showed no ER effect. Upon investigating the dielectric properties,
it was discovered that the octa-isobutyl POSS/silicone oil system
is not dielectrically active, while that of TSAE-POSS is active and
it was concluded that the presence of the sulfonated groups is responsible
for the dipolar behavior. McIntyre et al.1 did another study, which was an improvement in the previous work
in ref (3). This study
showed that when mixed with a small (1 wt %) amount of nanocage s-POSS,
micrometer-sized polystyrene (PS) particles (10 wt %) in PDMS (89
wt %) liquid gave a significant ER effect. They associated this improved
behavior to the formation of a thin adsorbed layer of s-POSS onto
the PS surfaces to give a new core/shell particle with improved dielectric
and conductive properties. The s-POSS/PS/PDMS suspension exhibited
an increase in ER activity by an order of magnitude beyond that of
the s-POSS/PDMS suspension. McIntyre et al.7 improved on their work using sulfonated polystyrene particles (s-PS)
instead of PS. The s-PS with s-POSS and PDMS combined to give an even
better ER effect. The s-POSS/s-PS/PDMS system exhibited a further
increase in yield stress of over 200% when compared with the s-POSS/PS/PDMS
mixture.

We recently showed that a new class of ER fluid (octafunctionalized
POSS variant in PDMS) exhibited an ER effect. This new POSS cage structure
for ER applications was synthesized in our previous work4 using the hydrolyzation route and was characterized.
The dielectric study was done, and rheological properties were examined.
In this research, the effects of the number of cyano functional groups
attached to the POSS cage structure are shown. The two compounds of
the octahedral geometry (T8) of cPOSS were used for this
investigation. One of the compounds, octafunctionalized cyanopropylsilsesquioxane
(8 CN-POSS), was synthesized and characterized in our previous work4 and the other compound monofunctionalized cyanopropylisobutylsilsesquioxane
(1 CN-POSS) was commercially available. The effects of the functional
group attached to the inorganic silicon–oxygen core structure
of the POSS compounds on the rheological properties are demonstrated
through steady flow and oscillatory tests. Particular attention is
paid to how the number of cyano functional groups affects the behavior
of these suspensions of cPOSS compounds in silicone oil under increasing
electric field strength.

Results and Discussion
Dielectric Properties
The dielectric test was carried
out to gain further insight into the differences in the magnitude
of the polarizability of the suspensions. Systems with high dielectric
constants give enhanced particle polarization, and this leads to strong
and stable mesostructure formation within the suspension spanning
the electrodes.3 The height of the ε′
curve shown in Figure 1 reflects the size of the induced dipole moment, which indicates
the presence of polarization. The data in Figure 1 show that the 8 CN-POSS exhibited a higher
permittivity than the 1 CN-POSS. The introduction of the cyano group
to the POSS cage structure led to increased polarization and dielectric
activity. The relative permittivity of both suspensions ascends in
the low-frequency region, while the dielectric loss shows descent
from its maximum value in the low-frequency region. This is an unusual
occurrence. This anomalous increase in the dielectric constant before
the decrease is attributed to low-frequency conductance. The conductivity
peak can result at lower frequencies when the field is not alternating
as quickly, and this conductivity is that of the particles and not
the suspension. The mechanism of the ER effect had earlier been investigated
and understood to be governed by interfacial polarization11 through a slow polarization process (<1 ×
105 Hz). There is no obvious dielectric relaxation observed
for the two suspensions between the 1 × 102 and 1
× 105 Hz frequency region at the concentration tested
as recommended in the work done by Hao et al.20

8 CN-POSS and 1 CN-POSS in PDMS suspension.

Steady Shear Electrorheological Behavior of 8 CN-POSS and 1
CN-POSS
The dependence of the shear stress on the shear rate
for the different concentrations is shown in Figure 2. The steady-state flow curves were measured
with and without applying the electric field to show the ER activity
of the suspensions of both ER particles. The non-Newtonian behavior
of both suspensions can be seen in Figure 2. An apparent yield stress is developed even
at the 1% wt concentration without the electric field applied. The
non-Newtonian behavior of the concentrations of both suspensions at
no applied electric field in Figure 2 is unusual, especially for the lowest concentration
of 1%. Previous work of Liu et al.18 showed
a Newtonian behavior for silica microspheres and for particle concentration
that was as high as 10% by volume. Conversely, an optically transparent
ER fluid of urea-modified silica nanoparticles, which have been fabricated
by Liu et al.,19 have been found to behave
like a non-Newtonian fluid, but at a higher concentration of 10% by
volume at no electric field applied. They attributed this behavior
to the dispersion state of the particles and their wettability to
the dispersing oil medium. At 0 kV/mm in Figure 2, the flow curve data appear noisy and remain
relatively the same for 0 kV/mm measurements as concentration increases
for both 8 CN-POSS and 1 CN-POSS. At 4 kV/mm, it is seen that the
shear stress increases as concentration increases. The increased amount
of polarizable particles in the suspensions leads to a stiffer solid
network being formed, and thus, a higher ER effect. This increase
in shear stress is pronounced in the 8 CN-POSS suspension as the concentration
is increased in the on-state of 4 kV/mm. The ER effect is higher in
the 8 CN-POSS more than the 1 CN-POSS because of the polarity of the
eight cyanopropyl functional groups attached to it. The higher particle
concentrations in the suspensions are able to form stiffer and stronger
chain-like structures than the suspensions with lower particle loading.
The highest concentration of the 8 CN-POSS at 8% showed the highest
ER response at the 4 kV/mm electric field strength. The 1 CN-POSS
suspension only showed a slight increase in shear stress, even in
the on-state of 4 kV/mm.

0 and 4 kV/mm for all concentrations.

Figure 3 (a) Shear stress vs shear rate curves for varying electric
fields of 8% wt suspensions and Herschel–Bulkley fit of curves.
(b) Herschel–Bulkley yield stress calculated from flow curves
at different electric fields for 8% wt suspensions.

The electric field-induced ER effect is shown in Figure 3a, which shows a
plot of the 8% wt concentration of both ER suspensions. The shear
stress of the 8 CN-POSS is seen to increase as the electric field
is increased from 1 to 4 kV/mm. It is important to note the sharp
decrease in the shear stress values of the 8 CN-POSS in the lower
shear rate region of <2 (1/s) at the highest electric field of
4 kV/mm. The drop in the shear rate may be associated with an electric
saturation of the suspension. This occurrence is mainly in the lower
shear rate region where the hydrodynamic forces are weak, and there
is sufficient particle-to-particle interaction and contact for electrostatic
discharge to occur. The dielectric particles within the suspension,
therefore, breakdown as the electric field strength is increased beyond
its breakdown voltage, and it acts as an electrical conductor with
electrostatic discharge. Thus, the yield stress for the suspensions
at increased concentrations go through a maximum at 3 kV/mm and then
drops.4,13

The apparent yield stress of the suspensions
of the ER particles from Figure 3b suggests that even in the absence of the electric
field (0 kV/mm), the ER particles in the suspensions will arrange
into a network-like structure with the fluid, resulting in gel-like
viscoelastic behavior.12 The yield stress
is the stress required for flow to occur, and it depicts the strength
of the solid network of particles in the suspension. The Herschel–Bulkley
yield stress for the off-state and on-state of the varying electric
field applied has been shown in Figure 3b and is calculated from the flow curves of the ER
suspensions. The nonlinear Herschel–Bulkley model was used
to fit the flow curve data.

The log–log dependence of
the yield stress on the electric field strength obeys the power law
from the conduction and polarization models. 1  where q is the rigidity of
the internal structures formed when the electric field is applied,
and the value α should be within the range of 1.5–2 for
well-developed structures for the conduction model and 2 for the polarization
model.10,21 The conduction model considers particle
interaction only as the factor for the ER effect when the gap between
the conducting particles in the fluid decreases and the α value
approaches 1.5.21 As shown in Figure 3b, τy scales
as ∼E0.7 for the 8 CN-POSS and
as small as E0.15 for 1 CN-POSS. The polarization
model on the other hand relates the material parameters such as the
dielectric constants of the liquid and solid particles to the rheological
properties using an idealized ER system of uniform hard dielectric
spheres dispersed in a Newtonian fluid medium and the yield stress
is found to be proportional to the square of the applied electric
field (i.e., α = 2).

Figure 4 shows the ER efficiency dependence on the
concentration at shear rates of 10 (1/s) and 100 (1/s). The ER efficiency
measures the electroviscosity difference between the off-state when
no field is applied and the on-state with the applied electric field.14 It is given as efficiency 2  In this case, the data presented in Figure 4 is the difference
in viscosity at 0 kV/mm, when no field was applied, and 4 kV/mm. This
is an important parameter that can be used to analyze the performance
of the ER fluid across the shear rate band.6 The ER efficiency increases as the concentration increases for the
8 CN-POSS compared to the 1 CN-POSS, which is basically a flat line
as shown in Figure 4 for the 10 (1/s) and 100 (1/s). This is an indication that the 8
CN-POSS has a higher ER effect than the 1 CN-POSS as a result of the
increased number of cyano functional groups attached to its cage structure.
The increase in viscosity for the 8 CN-POSS at higher shear rates
of 100 (1/s) for instance is not as great as the lower shear rates
because the structures at high shear rates have been broken apart.

and 100 (1/s).

Linear Viscoelastic (LVE) Behavior of 8 CN-POSS and 1 CN-POSS
Research has shown that ER fluids behave as viscoelastic materials.12 Oscillatory tests carried out to determine the
viscoelastic properties of the ER suspension help provide a better
understanding of the microstructural changes in the linear and nonlinear
viscoelastic regions.

The complex shear moduli G′ and G″ were measured at varying
electric field strengths at an increment of 1–4 kV/mm as shown
in Figure 5. These
measurements allow for the comparison of the structure within the
suspensions. The viscoelastic network of the ER suspensions of 8 CN-POSS
and 1 CN-POSS is shown in Figure 5. The storage and loss moduli increase as the electric
field is increased with 8 CN-POSS showing a higher increase in the
storage and loss modulus values across the strain tested. The linear
viscoelastic (LVE) region is the range in which the test can be carried
out without destroying the structure of the sample. The plateau in
the lower strain area that characterizes this LVE region (seen in
(top) of Figure 5 at
1 and 2 kV/mm) can be seen to become shorter as the electric field
is increased. The storage modulus becomes increasingly nonlinear as
the electric field increases, and it can be assumed that the deformation
occurring to the structures is not reversible. The behavior of the
loss modulus at lower electric fields (Figure 5 (bottom)) shows an internal structure that
is characterized by a weak strain overshoot15 called the “Type III behavior”, where we see a strain
hardening followed by a strain thinning. Normalization curves of G′ and G″ will show a transition
from Type III to Type I (strain thinning) where the loss modulus decreases
as the electric field strength increases.

At increasing electric fields from 1 to 4 kV/mm for 8% wt concentration.

Figure 6 shows the frequency sweep of the ER fluid with both the storage
modulus in Figure 6a and the loss modulus
in Figure 6b at 1%
fixed strain. The frequency sweep was used to investigate the time-dependent
deformation behavior of the suspension in the linear viscoelastic
region. Both the storage and loss modulus showed an increase as the
strength of the applied electric field is increased, indicating that
the ER fluids show solid behavior.22 The
8 CN-POSS showed a higher storage modulus than the 1 CN-POSS. There
is an increase of the storage modulus at higher frequencies. At higher
frequencies, the structures in the suspension exhibit less flexibility
and higher rigidity at a faster motion, and the storage modulus values
could increase up to five to ten times higher than the plateau region
at a low frequency.23

Conclusions
Our previous experiments established the
fact that the 8 CN-POSS is electrorheologically responsive. The effect
of the number of functional groups attached to the octahedral POSS
geometry on the ER response has been shown in this work by comparing
the 8 CN-POSS with a commercial variant 1 CN-POSS, through steady
flow tests and oscillatory tests. Concentrations of 1, 4, 6, and 8%
by weight were prepared for the ER suspensions. The electrorheological
characterization and analysis such as the steady flow curves, Herschel–Bulkley
yield stress, and ER efficiency indicate that the ER effect of the
8 CN-POSS is greater with the increasing concentration and electric
field strength than the 1 CN-POSS. The power-law with respect to conduction
and polarization models has been used to quantify the ER effect. The
viscoelastic analysis of both ER suspensions also shows that the 8
CN-POSS has a greater ER effect. The polarizability of the particles
in the suspension was investigated, and the 8 CN-POSS was found to
have a higher dielectric constant. Adjusting the functional groups
attached on cage structures could improve the ER properties of ER
fluid designs, which can be used for various electrorheological applications.

Experimental Section
In our previous work,4 the hydrolyzation route used by Dare et al.8 was adopted to synthesize the 8 CN-POSS cage
structure. The suspensions of both 1 CN-POSS, which is commercially
available, and 8 CN-POSS have been compared in this work. Figure 7 shows the structure
of both 8 CN-POSS and 1 CN-POSS. The 500 cSt silicone oil was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and the 1 CN-POSS particles were purchased from
Hybrid plastics.

Characterization of 8 CN-POSS and 1 CN-POSS
The microstructure
and morphology of the synthesized 8 CN-POSS and commercially available
1 CN-POSS were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

The SEM images of 8 CN-POSS in Figure 8a show that the particles are micrometer-sized
and are well dispersed in size and range from 1 to 200 μm, while
the SEM images of 1 CN-POSS in Figure 8b show that the particles are also micrometer-sized
and range in size from 5 to 100 μm and appear smoother compared
to 8 CN-POSS.

magnification. (b) SEM images of 1 CN-POSS in the increasing order
of magnification.

The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra method via a Cary 630 FTIR instrument was
used to identify the absorption bands and assign them to the bonds
within the compound. According to FTIR spectra database and the literature,9 for 8 CN-POSS; stretching vibrations for the
−CN group was seen at 2245.8 cm–1, stretching
vibration for the C–H group at 2939.8 cm–1 and bending vibration at 1406.0 cm–1, stretching
vibration for the Si–C group at 747.4 cm–1, while 1096 cm–1 corresponds to the Si–O
stretch. For 1 CN-POSS; the −CN group stretch was barely seen,
C–H stretching was seen at 2952.3 cm–1, the
Si–C stretch was seen at 739.4 cm–1, and
the Si–O stretch at 1079.8 cm–1.

Preparation of Electrorheological Suspensions
The required
quantities of 8 CN-POSS and 1 CN-POSS and silicone oil of 500 cSt
viscosity were weighed and vacuum-dried at 130 °C for 24 h to
ensure that traces of moisture that would influence the outcome of
the results are eliminated. After drying, the POSS compounds were
crushed to ensure a uniform particle size distribution. Contact with
air was minimized by capping the containers, and concentrations of
1, 4, 6, and 8% by weight were prepared in separate vials. A homogenous
mixture between the particles and the silicone oil was obtained using
a vortex mixer.

Electrorheological Measurements
Rheological properties
were measured with a strain-controlled Anton Paar MCR 302 parallel
plate rheometer. A plate size of 25 mm was used and 0.3 mm spacing
between plates in such a way that to achieve a 1 kV/mm electric field
strength, a setting of 0.3 kV will have to be entered. The electric
field was applied using the FuG DC power supply HCP 14-12500. The
sample from the vial is slowly
and uniformly dispersed onto the top of the bottom plate, and the
required experimental settings are entered in the PC rheoplus software
before the start of each test. Each test (rotational, oscillatory
tests) was carried out with fresh samples because once a sample is
used, the structure is broken down and takes time to rebuild, therefore
the chances of having an accurate result with the same sample reduce.
A shear rate sweep of 0.1–100 s–1 was done
at fields of 0–4 kV/mm in 1 kV/mm incremental steps for all
four concentrations prepared. This was done at a constant temperature
(25 °C) to measure the flow curves. The yield stress of the suspensions
was ascertained using the Herschel–Bulkley model. Oscillatory
tests for strain amplitude were conducted at variable amplitudes or
strain from a lower to a higher strain, while the frequency is held
constant. Amplitude sweep was done from 0.1 to 1000% at a constant
frequency of 10 rad/s at electric fields ranging from 0 to 4 kV/mm
in steps of 1 kV/mm. The storage and loss moduli are derived from
this experiment

Dielectric Spectroscopy of Suspension
The dielectric
test was conducted at 25 °C over a range of 20 Hz to 1 MHz frequency
measured by an IET 1920 precision LCR meter equipped with a liquid
measurement cell, which has two metal electrodes separated by a Teflon
spacer. The test was carried out with a 2% wt concentration of both
compounds in silicone oil. The aluminum measuring cell was filled
with the suspension, and the terminals from the LCR meter was connected
to the ends of the cell. The capacitance and dissipation factor were
recorded remotely on the PC. The parallel plate capacitor equation 3  was used to calculate the dielectric constant.
The dielectric loss was also calculated.
