A method for conjugating cholesterol
to peptide ligands through
non-disperse polyethylene glycol (ND-PEG) through a non-hydrolysable
linkage is described. The iterative addition of tetraethylene glycol
macrocyclic sulfate to cholesterol (Chol) renders a family of highly
pure well-defined Chol-PEG compounds with different PEG lengths from
4 up to 20 ethylene oxide units, stably linked through an ether bond.
The conjugation of these Chol-PEG compounds to the cyclic (RGDfK)
peptide though Lys5 side chains generates different lengths of Chol-PEG-RGD
conjugates that retain the oligomer purity of the precursors, as analysis
by HRMS and NMR has shown. Other derivatives were synthesized with
similar results, such as Chol-PEG-OCH3 and Chol-PEG conjugated
to glutathione and Tf1 peptides through maleimide–thiol chemoselective
ligation. This method allows the systematic synthesis of highly pure
uniform stable Chol-PEGs, circumventing the use of activation groups
on each elongation step and thus reducing the number of synthesis
steps.

Introduction
Cholesterol (Chol)
is an essential component of the plasma membrane
of the eukaryotic cell. By improving the physical stability of the
membrane, cholesterol plays a crucial role in membrane integrity,
modulating membrane permeability and transmembrane signaling.1 Chol is extensively used to stabilize liposomes
and other lipid-based nanovesicles (L-NVs) and also reduce the permeability
of encapsulated drugs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of drug encapsulation.2−4 Furthermore, its 3β-hydroxyl group offers a chemical point
for derivatization, thus allowing the generation of numerous Chol
conjugates. In this regard, cholesteryl–polyethylene glycol
(Chol-PEG) conjugates are commonly used in the production of PEG-coated
liposomes or other nanovesicles to prolong their circulation time
in plasma, improving the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the encapsulated
drugs.5,6 Chol-PEG conjugates also behave as solubilizing
surfactants that serve to prevent aggregation of the formulated nanovesicles.5 The coating abilities of these conjugates are
also used to increase the colloidal stability and aqueous dispersity
of metallic nanoparticles, such as gold nanorods.7 Moreover, the amphiphilic character of Chol-PEG conjugates
can facilitate their self-assembly by forming micelles, which have
been used as delivery systems for poorly water-soluble anticancer
agents such as quercetin8 and docetaxel.9 In fact, some drug delivery systems based on
Chol-PEG conjugates exploit the capacity of cholesterol moieties to
trigger their endocytosis through a lipid-raft-mediated mechanism,
minimizing the endo-lysosomal trafficking after internalization.10,11 Cholesterol’s ability to anchor into cell membranes is also
exploited for the development of Chol-PEG-based cell membrane imaging
probes12−14 and eukaryote15 and bacteria16 cell surface engineering. Additionally, these
Chol-PEG moieties are versatile scaffolds that can be modified with
specific targeting ligands and used in drug nanoformulations to enhance
their capacity to accumulate in specific cells and/or tissues. Recently,
Chol-peptide conjugates have demonstrated great potential as hybrid
materials with unique properties and pharmacological applications.17

In the literature, Cholesterol and PEGs
have been conjugated mainly
through an ester bond linkage and, to a lesser extent, by an ether
or a carbamate bond.1,5,18 The
preferential use of an ester bond is associated with the straightforward
introduction of the different-PEG-length moieties onto Chol. However,
esters are easily hydrolyzed, thus releasing Chol and altering the
behavior of the nanovesicles, for instance, favoring their aggregation.
The use of Chol-PEG conjugates linked through a more stable chemical
function, like an ether, can overcome these drawbacks and generate
nanoformulation systems with a more predictable behavior.19,20 These stable Chol-PEG conjugates are usually synthesized by polymerization
processes, and the final molecules contain non-uniform PEG moieties.
However, the synthesis of Chol-PEG units linked through an ether bond
containing non-disperse PEGs (ND-PEGs) is arduous.21−24 Given the known correlation between
erratic biological activities and non-uniform PEG lengths,25−27 the use of ND-PEGs in drug delivery systems has recently attracted
a growing interest. Here, we report the synthesis of a family of non-disperse
ether-linked Chol-PEGn-OH derivatives (from 4 up
to 20 ethylene oxide units) prepared using a recently described methodology28,29 based on the use of tetraethylene glycol macrocyclic sulfate as
the electrophile moiety to allow iterative PEG chain elongation. This
methodology afforded the desired pure compounds via straightforward
work-up procedures, without any chromatographic purification. Additionally,
Chol-PEGn-OH moieties were derivatized with targeting
peptides, either via carbamate bonds or by a chemoselective thiol
maleimide ligation, obtaining Chol-PEGn-peptide conjugates
in good yield and excellent purity (up to 99%). In the future, we
plan to explore the impact of the PEG lengths of these conjugates
on the physicochemical properties of different lipid-based nanovesicles
and on their biological behavior, but herein we focus on the development
of a methodology for their production.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Chol-PEGn
To generate
the Chol-PEGn units, we explored two strategies:
first, a sequential two-step process based on alcohol tosylation of
Chol or Chol-PEG and subsequent reaction with tetraethylene glycol
(TEG) and, second, an iterative addition of tetraethylene glycol macrocyclic
sulfate to Chol or Chol-PEG hydroxyl groups. We have previously reported
the synthesis of Chol-PEG4-RGD starting from Chol.30 The formation of Chol-PEG4-OH (4a) was carried
out using a Williamson-type ether synthesis (Scheme 1), achieving good yields through the reaction
of cholesteryl p-toluenesulfonate (3a) with TEG using 1,4-dioxane as a solvent under reflux. However,
attempts to increase the PEG chain length of 4a following
this strategy did not afford the desired PEG-chain elongation. Recently,
the synthesis of linear ND-PEGs has been described using oligoethylene
glycol (OEG) macrocyclic sulfates as electrophilic moieties to react
with PEG terminal hydroxyl groups.28,29 Compared to
other reported methods, with this strategy, it is not necessary to
work with protecting or activating groups during the elongation process
and the number of synthesis steps is reduced. The use of the tetraethylene
glycol macrocyclic sulfate as an elongation building block that contains
the activation moiety allows us to explore Chol-PEG growth avoiding
the use of activating groups such as p-toluensulfonate,
which in our hands has resulted in being unsatisfactory to produce
Chol-PEGn (n > 4). We then considered
applying this methodology to the synthesis of Chol-PEGn structures with a well-defined molecular size. To develop an economically
effective synthesis and following our previous work,19,20 we performed the PEG elongation experiments using compound 4a as the starting material and we generated Chol-PEGn derivatives of different PEG lengths applying this new
methodology. Chol-PEG4 4a was treated with NaH at 0 °C
for 2 h. The resulting alkoxide was reacted with the macrocyclic sulfate 2 at reflux overnight to afford the intermediate Chol-PEG8-sulfate.
This intermediate was hydrolyzed with a THF/H2O mixture
and H2SO4 at reflux for 5 h to render Chol-PEG8 5 in an 83% yield (Scheme 1). Other methodologies to prepare compound 5 have been reported in the literature,22 but they involve tedious steps of selective monoprotection of oligoethylene
glycol moieties. Iterative addition of TEG macrocyclic sulfate 2 following the same procedure resulted in a viable approach
to increase the PEG chain length up to PEG20 for the first time with
a 57% yield and excellent purity (99% as shown by HPLC, see Table 1 and the Supporting Information) and without the need
of any chromatographic purification. The use of 3 equiv of macrocyclic
sulfate 2 was necessary to ensure complete reactions
and avoid mixtures of Chol-PEGn units with different
PEG lengths. We assessed the scalability of the process by preparing
Chol-PEG8 5 in a 2 g scale with the same excellent results.

Using this approach, we also prepared
compound 4b that
retains the chirality of the cholesterol β-hydroxyl group (Scheme 1) being the enantiomer
of the previously described 4a. In this case, treating
Chol 1 with NaH at 0 °C for 2 h followed by a reaction
with macrocyclic sulfate 2 at rt was unsuccessful. Remarkably,
when the temperature of the ring-opening reaction was increased (up
to reflux using THF as a solvent), product 3b was obtained
in good yields after 12 h. Acid hydrolysis of this intermediate afforded
Chol-PEG4 4b, which was analyzed by HRMS (ESI) to confirm
its integrity. To the best of our knowledge, no previous examples
using Chol 1 as a nucleophile for the ring-opening reaction
of macrocyclic sulfates have been described. The methodology described
herein will allow the preparation of even longer Chol-PEG derivatives
in a straightforward manner. Chol-PEGn moieties were
purified by flash chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate for Chol-PEG4
and CH2Cl2 with an increasing percentage of
ethanol (0 to 80%) for Chol-PEG8 to Chol-PEG20. The purity of all
compounds was determined by UPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS with it being higher
than 95% in all cases (Table 1). HRMS analysis confirmed the excellent purity and integrity
of the final Chol-PEGn products (4a, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and
was used to determine their polydispersity indexes (PDIs).

A
key parameter for the high quality of the Chol-PEGn platforms is the base selected to generate the alkoxide derivatives,
as Tanaka,31 Davis,32 and Bruce25 reported. In our
protocol, we used NaH, a strong base that can generate PEG alkoxides
that lead to chain scission, but the control of the number of equivalents
of NaH and the reaction times were enough to minimize this secondary
reaction. The PDIs observed for all the Chol-PEGn synthesized are indicative of highly monodisperse compounds (Table 1).

Synthesis of
Chol-PEGn-OCH3
Since PEGs are
susceptible to oxidative degradation when exposed
to air, most of the PEGs used for coating nanoparticles are CH3 end-capped. Methylation of the Chol-PEGn-OH moieties was achieved by their treatment with NaH at 0 °C
for 1 h and then by reaction with CH3I at rt for an extra
hour, achieving excellent yields and purities (Table 1).

Synthesis of Chol-PEGn-RGD
We then
studied the introduction of a peptide ligand as a targeting unit into
these Chol-PEGn-OH moieties. As a proof of concept,
we selected the cyclo-(RGDfK) peptide 12, a specific
ligand for integrin receptors that has been widely used in drug delivery
systems for cancer therapies.33 This peptide
has a ζ-NH2 group in the Lys side chain (HZ1,2),
which can be easily derivatized and used for conjugation purposes.

The conjugation of cyclo-(RGDfK)19 was
performed via a two-step process based on the transformation of the
hydroxyl group of Chol-PEGn-OH to the corresponding
chloroformate or ester carbonate and subsequent peptide introduction
through a carbamate bond. The following hydroxyl derivatizations to
ester carbamate were explored: (a) nitrophenyl carbonate by a reaction
with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate and (b) succinimidyl carbonate by
direct derivatization with N,N′-disuccinimidyl carbonate. In both the chloroformate and nitrophenyl
carbonate derivatizations, the reaction with the peptide produces
a side product resulting from the incorporation of a second unit of
the peptide to the Chol-PEG4-RGD moiety. In detail, in these reactions,
the carboxylic acid of the side chain of the Asp residue of Chol-PEG4-RGD
was transformed into a reactive derivative, thus favoring the introduction
of a second unit of cyclo-(RGDfK) 12 by means of an amide
bond. Although condition b allowed full conversion of Chol-PEG4 into
Chol-PEG4-RGD, a more appropriate two-step derivatization strategy
was developed (Scheme 2), consisting of the preparation of the chloroformate derivatives
by a reaction of Chol-PEGn-OH with a phosgene solution
in toluene. These compounds were then smoothly converted into the
succinimidyl ester carbonates derivatives by addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Cyclo-(RGDfK) introduction onto these
Chol-PEGn derivatives allowed the preparation of
Chol-PEGn-RGD compounds (13–17) with a high yield (up to 87%) and purity (up to 99%, see Table 1, Figures 1 and 2, and the Supporting Information).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Chol-PEGn-RGD Conjugates
Remarkably, the PDIs of all Chol-PEGn-RGDs showed
values similar to those previously determined for their precursors
(Table 1 and the Supporting Information).25,31,32 The purification of Chol-PEGn-RGD conjugates when n was 4, 8, and 12 (compounds 13, 14, and 15) was carried out
by washing the compound precipitated with H2O to remove
the excess c(RGDfK) peptide and CH3CN to eliminate the
unreacted Chol-PEGn. Due to the solubility in H2O of Chol-PEG16-RGD (16) and Chol-PEG20-RGD (17), these compounds were purified by solid-phase extraction
using a PoraPak Rxn cartridge (Waters) and eluting with H2O with an increasing percentage of ethanol (0 to 100%).

HR-NMR Analysis
of the c(RGDfK) Peptide and Chol-PEGn-RGD
The c(RGDfK) peptide was unambiguously assigned
using a combination of 2D TOCSY and NOESY experiments both in water
and in DMSO solvents. We used 1D 13C NMR to follow the
intensity changes at the PEG chain resonances (−OCH2CH2O−) and confirm the PEG length increases in
the different Chol-PEGn-RGD conjugates (Figure S52 in the Supporting Information). In
these comparisons, the remaining signals of the molecule are the same,
corroborating the data achieved by mass spectrometry. Furthermore,
we also acquired and assigned 2D TOCSY and 2D NOESY experiments for
each Chol-PEGn-RGD derivative. Depending on the solubility
of the samples, these experiments were acquired either in DMSO (for
derivatives up to PEG16) or in water (for Chol-PEG20). Specific chemical
shift changes were observed for the Lys5 side-chain resonances, corroborating
that the Chol-PEGn system is attached to the RGD
peptide through the Lys5 HZ1 proton. To illustrate these differences,
the superposition of the RGD peptide to Chol-PEG20-RGD (17) is shown in Figure 2. The conjugate Chol-PEG12-RGD is also indicated. Other conjugated
systems are shown as well in the Supporting Information.

Synthesis of Other Chol-PEG-Peptide Ligands
We also
studied the introduction of two other peptide ligands into the Chol-PEG
platforms using chemoselective ligation between maleimides and thiols
to generate the corresponding conjugates (Scheme 3). For this purpose, we selected two Cys-containing
peptides for conjugation: T7, a transferrin-receptor 1 (TfR1) binding
peptide3421 modified with
a Cys at its N-terminal position, which was synthesized
by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis, and a reduced glutathione,
a tripeptide that contains a Cys on its sequence, used to permeate
the blood–brain barrier through a transporter protein.35

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Chol-PEG4-Maleimide and Conjugation
with Blood–Brain
Barrier Shuttle Peptides
Chol-PEG4-maleimide derivative 20 was prepared by
a reaction of Chol-PEG4-OH 4a with a phosgene solution
in toluene for 2 h and then followed by the addition of the previously
synthesized maleimide moiety 19, achieving a yield of
35%. The T7 peptide 21 was conjugated to intermediate 20 by reacting for 36 h in DMF at rt. After solvent evaporation
and subsequent addition of acetonitrile, the final product 22 was isolated as a precipitate in a 58% yield. In the case of glutathione
conjugation, we used DMSO as a solvent because of the insolubility
of the reduced glutathione in DMF. Compound 23 was obtained
by precipitation in acetonitrile with a yield of 49%. All compounds
were characterized by HRMS, which confirmed their chemical integrity.

Conclusions
Although a large number of methods to generate
Chol-PEG conjugates
have been described, practically all of them render nonuniform Chol-PEG
where both subunits can be linked through degradable (ester) or stable
(carbamate or ether) bonds. Generally, the instability and/or the
nonuniform character of these conjugates has been associated to reproducibility
issues and erratic behavior in in vivo experiments of diverse nanovesicles
in different applications. This fact, together with the increased
characterization requirements for nanoformulation components, has
generated an increasing interest in the development of strategies
to produce well-defined hybrid molecules as Chol-PEG conjugates. We
have devised an efficient methodology to synthesize highly non-disperse
directly linked Chol-PEGn (n = 4–20)
via an ether linkage involving iterative addition of tetraethylene
glycol macrocyclic sulfate to cholesterol in combination with an accurate
control of base equivalents and reaction times. The use of the tetraethylene
glycol macrocyclic sulfate as an elongation building block, which
contains the sulfate as an activation moiety, circumvents the use
of protecting or activation groups on each PEG growth step. Thus,
compared to other methods the number of synthesis steps is reduced
during the PEG elongation process. This approach allows us to prepare
stable Chol-PEGn compounds with n ≥ 6 in a straightforward manner without a purification process
during PEG chain growth and permits the methodic synthesis of all
Chol-PEGn (n, n + 4, n + 8, ...), allowing us to study systematically
the effect of increasing units of ethylene glycol on properties such
as solubility or integration capacity onto natural or artificial membranes
(nanovesicles). The use of these uniform Chol-PEGn conjugates in different applications such as liposomes or nanovesicle
formulations can help fine-tune their physical–chemical properties
and behavior in vivo. Furthermore, we have conjugated Chol-PEGn with different peptide ligands preserving its uniform
properties and generating highly pure peptide conjugates that were
easily isolated by simple precipitation or solid-phase extraction
cartridges. Other methodologies purify the protected final compound
by gel silica chromatography and then eliminate the protecting groups.

This strategy enhances the feasibility to synthesize “a
la carte” Chol-PEG conjugates with a range of PEG lengths,
linkages, and peptide ligands, thereby modulating the properties of
these systems in the formulation of targeted nanosystems for drug
delivery. Given the fact that very few very well defined PEG drugs
are available, this synthesis makes a significant contribution to
expanding the portfolio of Chol-PEGn compounds with
potential applications in drug delivery systems, membrane imaging
or engineering, and sensors, thus helping them progress into clinic
practice. Currently, we are studying the physical–chemical
and biological properties of our different-length Chol-PEG conjugates
in diverse lipid nanoformulations for drug delivery purposes.

Synthesis of Chol-PEGn
Tetraethylene Glycol Macrocyclic
Sulfate (2)
Compound 2 was synthesized
as described previously
by Zhang et al.28 Briefly, tetraethylene
glycol (10.00 g, 51.49 mmol) was placed in a 2 L round-bottomed flask
under a N2 atmosphere and dissolved with anhyd CH2Cl2 (1200 mL), and DMAP (314 mg, 0,05 equiv) and DIEA
(42 mL, 4.8 equiv) were added. Then, a solution of thionyl chloride
(7.51 mL, 2 equiv) in anhyd CH2Cl2 (250 mL)
was added slowly at 0 °C. After 6 h, sat. NaCl (500 mL) was added
slowly at 0 °C, and the reaction was stirred overnight. After
this period, the two phases were separated, and the aqueous phase
was washed with CH2Cl2 (3 × 100 mL). All
the organic phases were pulled together, dried over MgSO4, and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated to dryness. The intermediate
was purified by flash chromatography using silica gel as the stationary
phase and hexane/CH2Cl2/EtOAc as the mobile
phase to afford the tetraethylene glycol macrocyclic sulfite intermediate
(8.64 g, 70% yield). 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 3.68 (m, 8H), 3.82 (m, 4H), 4.10 (m, 2H), 4.35 (m, 2H).
This compound (3.088 g, 12.85 mmol) was suspended in a mixture of
CH3CN:CCl4:H2O (1:1:1.5, 122 mL:122
mL:504 mL), and then NaIO4 (5.50 g, 2 equiv) and RuCl3 (13.3 mg, 0.005 equiv) were added. The resulting mixture
was stirred for 2 h, and both phases were separated. The aqueous phase
was washed with CH2Cl2 (4 × 100 mL). All
the organic phases were pulled together, and the solvent was evaporated
affording compound 2 (pure, 2.90 g, 75% yield). HPLC-MS

Chol-PEG4 via Williamson-Type
Ether (4a)
Into a 100 mL round-bottomed flask,
cholesterol 1 (2.06
g, 5.33 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (14 mL) and 4-toluensulfonyl
chloride was added slowly at 0 °C, and the reaction was stirred
overnight. Then, pyridine was evaporated under reduced pressure, and
the crude was dissolved in 14 mL of chloroform. Subsequently, 80 mL
of CH3OH was slowly added until a precipitate was formed.
The crude was washed with CH3OH (2 × 25 mL) and CH3CN (25 mL) yielding 2.306 g (82% yield) of compound 3a as a white solid.

Compound 3a (2.306
g, 4.26 mmol) was weighted, and a solution of tetraethylene glycol
(13.97 g, 12.42 mL, 71.94 mmol, 17 equiv) in anhyd 1,4-dioxane (35
mL) was added dropwise with an addition funnel. The mixture was refluxed
with stirring for 24 h under an Ar atmosphere. Then, the mixture was
cooled down to rt, and it was concentrated to dryness. The resulting
crude was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and washed
with saturated NaHCO3 (2 × 20 mL), H2O
(2 × 30 mL), and saturated NaCl (1 × 20 mL). The organic
phases were dried over MgSO4 and filtered, and the solvent
was evaporated to dryness. The crude was purified by flash chromatography
using silica gel as the stationary phase and hexane/EtOAc as the mobile
phase to afford 4a (1.91 g, 80% yield) as a yellowish
oil. UPLC-MS (ESI, elution condition 7): tR: 1.03 min, calcd mass for C35H63O5+ [M + H]+: 563.46; found: 580.7 [M + H + H2O]+. Chemical purity: 99%. 1H NMR: (400

Chol-PEG4 via Macrocyclic Sulfate (4b)
In a two-neck 100 mL round-bottomed flask equipped
with a refrigerator
was placed 0.021 g of NaH 60% dispersed in mineral oil (0.522 mmol)
with 8 mL of THF and then added a solution of Chol (0.101 g, 0.26
mmol) in THF (13 mL) under an argon atmosphere at 0 °C. The white
suspension was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. After that, it was allowed
to temper until reaching room temperature and, a solution of cyclic
sulfate 2 (0.200 g, 0.780 mmol, 3 equiv) in anhyd THF
(10 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 36 h at reflux
and then cooled down, and THF was removed under vacuum. The residue
was dissolved in water (50 mL) then H2SO4 (2
mL, 35.49 mmol) was added, and it was refluxed for 5 h. The reaction

Synthesis of Chol-PEGn-RGD
Cyclo-(RGDfK) Peptide (12)
The synthesis
was carried out manually in a filter funnel with a pore size-1 fritted
glass disc that was modified with a PTFE key using 2-chlorotritil
resin (10.62 g, 0.68 mmol/g loading). First, the amino acid, Gly (3.75
g), was introduced in CH2Cl2 (4 mL) using N,N-disopropylethylamine (DIEA, 10.71 mL,
5 equiv) and left for 8 h. Then, capping with CH3OH (5
mL) and DIEA (1.071 mL, 0.5 equiv) was done for 30 min and consequently
washing with CH2Cl2, DMF, and CH2Cl2. The cleavage of the peptide was carried out by treatment
with a CH2Cl2:TFA (99:1 v/v) mixture (15–20
mL/g of resin) for 5 min and repeated five times affording the protected
peptide. Cyclization was carried out as described by Dai et al.36 with some modifications. The crude was dissolved
in ethyl acetate (1.3 L), and 4.86 mL of Et3N (20 equiv)
and 4.2 mL of T3P (8 equiv.) were added and stirred for
2 h. The protecting groups from the cyclic peptide were eliminated
by treatment with a mixture of 40 mL of TFA:TIPS:H2O (95:2.5:2.5
v/v/v) for 3 h. The final peptide was precipitated by addition of
cold diethyl ether and centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded
affording the cyclo-(RGDfK) (3.44 g, 58%) without purification. HPLC-MS

the solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Then, solvents
were removed under reduced pressure, and CH2Cl2 (10 mL) was added. This organic phase was washed with 5% aqueous
NaHCO3 (2 × 20 mL), and the combined organic phases
were dried with MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness. The crude
was used without any further purification in the peptide incorporation
reaction. In a 50 mL round-bottomed flask, the cyclo-(RGDfK) peptide
(0.446 g, 0.536 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in anhyd DMF (7 mL) and
DIEA (0.09 mL, 1 equiv.), and a solution of a succinimidyl ester carbonate
derivative of compound 4 (0.453 g, 0.643 mmol. 1.2 equiv)
