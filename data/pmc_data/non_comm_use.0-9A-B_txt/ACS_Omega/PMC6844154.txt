We
demonstrate an effective and facile method for the deposition
of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on graphene by using spontaneous galvanic
reaction. Despite the interest and importance of the hybrid structure
of noble metal-deposited graphene has been considerably increased
for its fundamental knowledge in chemical and physical sciences and
for its various applications, the progress of this subject is very
slow mainly because of the lack of synthetic methods for such structures,
especially that are not free from chemical contamination and usage
of complex and expensive equipment. Therefore, we developed a new
method allowing chemically pure AuNPs/graphene hybrid structures employing
galvanic reaction. The spontaneous galvanic reaction was derived from
reductant/graphene/oxidant sandwich structures, such as Au ions/graphene/Ge
wafer and Au ions/graphene/copper foil, by placing Au ion solution
droplets on graphene transferred on a germanium wafer or as made graphene
on Cu foil, respectively. According to scanning electron microscopy
and atomic force microscopy results, it was confirmed that AuNPs were
successfully formed on the graphene surface. This result implies two
important points. One is that the formation of pure AuNPs on graphene
is possible without using other chemicals frequently required for
conventional NP preparation. The other one is that it was experimentally
demonstrated that there are electronic communications between the
oxidant and reductant that are separated by graphene, through which
electrons can pass freely.

Introduction
The hybrid structures
of metal nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on
graphene have attracted a great deal of attention because of their
potential applications in various fields in physics,1 sensors,2 catalysts,3 and so forth. Therefore, many researchers have
contributed to develop methods to construct such hybrid structures
by using external potential,4 laser,5 various additives,6 and so forth. However, most of the proposed methods have various
limitations including cost ineffectiveness and process complexity
because they require the use of many chemicals, additional equipment,
or external energy source to apply. Among various electrochemical
deposition processes, spontaneous galvanic reaction has been considered
as one of the simplest and facile reactions that can form metal NPs
when the metal source ions are brought into contact with the target
substrate if their redox potential values are well matched.7 Previously, galvanic reaction was successfully
employed to spontaneously form noble metal NPs, such as Au, Pt, and
Pd NPs, on less noble metal or semiconductor substrates such as Cu
and Ge without additives such as reducing agents, pH adjusters, and
complexing agents.8 When the noble metal
cations and the substrate are in contact, the electrons withdrawn
from the reductant substrate by oxidation are used to reduce the metal
cations into the corresponding metal NPs on the substrate. In the
p-type semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube case, metal deposition
could also be achieved spontaneously and directly by the galvanic
reaction.9 However, in the graphene case,
the galvanic reaction could not be applied because of its intrinsic
semimetallic electronic structure. To overcome this limitation, we
designed reductant/graphene/oxidant sandwich structures, so that the
reductant and oxidant could cause the galvanic reaction and exchange
charges through graphene and eventually form AuNPs on the surface
of graphene.

Results and Discussion
We chose
germanium (Ge) and copper (Cu) as reductants that would
reduce noble metal cations (Au3+) upon contact into the
corresponding AuNPs according to thermodynamically favorable redox
potential energy (Table 1).10

To achieve the spontaneous metal deposition on graphene,
we first
fabricated samples of the graphene/Ge structure by transferring graphene
that was separately synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
process onto a Ge wafer substrate. (Detailed experimental method is
described in the Method Section). After that,
an aliquot of aqueous solution of AuCl4– (0.1 M) was dropped on graphene/Ge for 5 min (Scheme 1a). As a result, spherical AuNPs in a quite
uniform size (80–100 nm) were found on graphene as observed
by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) (Figures 1a,b and S1a). The size and
uniformity of the resulting AuNP are largely affected by several reaction
parameters including the concentration of AuCl4–, reaction time, and so forth. In addition, Raman spectra confirmed
the successful transfer of graphene on the Ge substrate, and the formation
of AuNPs was observed by enhanced Raman scattering because of AuNPs
formed on the top of the graphene surface (Figure S2). The elemental composition of the AuNPs and substrate was
investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S3).

and graphene/Cu

Shows Charge Communication between the Substrate (Ge or Cu) and AuCl4– Ions through Graphene
To confirm the origin of the electrons from Ge rather
than providing
electrons from graphene itself, a series of control experiments were
performed. We conducted the same reaction by using (1) the as-synthesized
graphene on copper (graphene/Cu) instead of Ge, which also has matched
the thermodynamically favorable redox potential (Table 1) to AuCl4– solution, and (2) the transferred graphene on SiO2 (graphene/SiO2) to make sure that the origin of the electron is Ge or Cu,
rather than graphene itself, thus to assure that graphene acts only
as a window for electrons. In the graphene/Cu case, Cu foil has an
advantage over Ge for preparing samples because Cu foil used for the
growth of graphene by CVD still can be used without any extra treatment,
which guarantees convenience and clean conditions. On the graphene/Cu
samples, spherical AuNPs of 50–80 nm size were formed into
a film (Figures 1c,d
and S1b). Also, we observed high crystallinity
of the resulting AuNPs by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) (Figure S4). On the other hand,
in the case of graphene/SiO2, no AuNP was found on graphene
(Figure S5). This clarifies that graphene
itself does not involve in the reduction of AuCl4–, so the electrons used for the formation of AuNPs on graphene/Ge
and graphene/Cu must come from Ge and Cu. In other words, the galvanic
reaction that took place across the graphene could offer direct and
facile metal NP deposition by using the electrons from Ge or Cu (Scheme 1b).

In general,
the size of noble metal NPs formed by the spontaneous
galvanic reaction is highly affected by the concentration of the oxidant
solution.11 Therefore, we examined the
change in AuNP size by varying the concentration of AuCl4– solution (Figure 2a). The AuCl4– solutions
at different concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL resulted in
the size increase of AuNPs from 49–106 and 85–141 to
289–690 nm, respectively. The trend indicates that the amount
of electrons withdrawn from the Ge substrate differs depending on
the concentration of the AuCl4– solution
and it affects the size of the resulting AuNPs. Furthermore, to examine
how many layers of graphene could be accessible for the spontaneous
deposition by electrochemically generated electrons, the reaction
was carried out with bilayer and trilayer graphene and exfoliated
thick graphite. As a result, AuNPs grown on the bilayer graphene were
similar to those of the monolayer graphene, and slightly larger AuNPs
were grown on the trilayer graphene (Figure S6), but no AuNP was formed on the exfoliated graphite on Ge (Figure S7). This indicates that charge communication
between the reductant and oxidant is available for bilayer and trilayer
graphene but not beyond them.

depending on the
AuCl4– concentration. (b) Dark-field
(left) and bright-field (right) TEM images of the AuNPs/graphene structure.
Red and blue dots show different grain, and the white dotted line
shows grain boundary.

The chance for the formation
of AuNPs in the gap space between
the graphene layer and Ge or Cu substrates was excluded because it
is well known that most of large ions and molecules including solvents
are impermeable to graphene.12 Moreover,
because all the reactions were performed by placing oxidant solution
droplets on the top of graphene, there is no chance for the oxidant
droplet to diffuse into the space between the graphene and substrate.
Furthermore, to confirm whether AuNPs were formed on graphene grain
or grain boundary, dark-field TEM measurement was conducted. As a
result, we observed the area that shows different grains and grain
boundaries (Figures S8 and 2b) and confirmed that AuNPs were formed on the graphene crystal
domain rather than on the grain boundary.

Meanwhile, another
direct evidence of charge communication between
the reductant and oxidant through graphene was obtained from the electrical
current flow through graphene. For this, we designed an electrochemical
cell to measure the electrical current generated upon the galvanic
reaction through graphene to elucidate the accurate and direct observation
of the charge communication through graphene (Figure 3a). The electrochemical cell has a hole with
a specific area to compare the accurate amount of electrons, and Ag/AgCl
and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively.
(Detailed experimental method was described in Method section). When
AuCl4– solution came into contact with
Cu or graphene/Cu, the Cu was oxidized and AuNPs were formed. Because
this means the electrons were extracted from Cu, we measured the current
as a function of time using electrochemical current measurements.
Because the redox reaction occurs spontaneously and immediately, the
initial current measurement was performed in deionized (DI) water,
and the change was measured upon adding AuCl4– solution while maintaining 0 V potential. To examine the tendency
of electron generation and the influence of the substrate on passing,
a series of control experiments were performed. We conducted the electrochemical
current measurements by using (1) Cu and (2) graphene/Cu. As a result,
from Cu and graphene/Cu cases, the instantaneous current increases
to −81.36 and −147.04 μA were observed, respectively,
and then a gradual decrease was observed (Figure 3b). The instantaneous current increase may
owe to extracting electrons from Cu, and the gradual decrease of the
current indicates the accumulation of AuNPs. Also, the electrochemical
current difference shown from Cu and graphene/Cu is believed to be
originated from the native oxide layer present only on Cu. The oxide-free
graphene/Cu shows a higher current level than the Cu-containing oxide
layer. Furthermore, when the bias voltage was increased to more negative,
the current also increased, which means the negative bias voltage
accelerates the oxidation of Cu, allowing a higher current to flow
(Figure S9). The concentration of AuCl4– solution also influences the current flow
because a high concentration of AuCl4– drives higher mass transfer of Cu2+; hence, more electrons
could be generated (Figure S10).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated
a direct and facile AuNPs deposition
process on graphene by using galvanic reaction. An efficient electron
transfer from the reductant to oxidant through graphene was induced
by spontaneous galvanic redox reaction from reductant/graphene/oxidant
sandwich structures and successfully resulted in AuNP deposition on
graphene. It is also noteworthy that this result also confirmed the
efficient charge communication through the graphene basal plane, by
confirming that the charge transfer occurs through the graphene basal
plane rather than through grain boundaries by performing TEM. Furthermore,
the charge communication was proved by electrochemical current measurements
that showed an immediate current increase. Our results have an importance
as they not only suggest the simplest way for the fabrication of the
metal NPs/graphene hybrid structure but also provide an opportunity
to prove charge communication in a system divided by graphene, which
can be further employed in various applications.

Method Section
General Information
All reagents were purchased from
commercial sources and used without further purification. HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich > 99.9 %), Cu foil (Alfa Aesar, 0.025 mm
thick,
annealed, coated, 99.8%, metals basis), and Ge(110) substrate (Crystal
bank, 500 μm thick, N-type, undoped, >50 Ω·cm
resistivity,
single-side polished). All the SEM images were obtained by using a
JEOL and AFM images using an atomic force microscope (Nanoscope III).
Raman spectra were obtained using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WiTec),
and XPS data were obtained at the Research Institute of Industrial
Science and Technology (RIST, Korea) (VG ESCALAB 250, VG Scientific).

Synthesis of Graphene by CVD
A piece of Cu foil (Alfa
Aesar, 0.025 mm thick, annealed, coated, 99.8%, metal basis) was purified
by soaking it in acetic acid (25%) and dried by N2 (99.999%)
blowing. The Cu foil was located at the center of the 1 in. protection
quartz tube inside a tube heating furnace under vacuum conditions
(∼4 × 10–2 Torr), and H2 gas
(40 sccm, ∼12 × 10–2 Torr) was flown
for 10 min to flush the protection tube. After that, temperature was
raised to 1050 °C and maintained for 10 minutes for annealing
of Cu foil; then, the CH4 gas (purity, vendor) was supplied
for 20 min. Moreover, the Cu foil was fast cooled to 25 °C by
opening the lid of the tube furnace, and CH4 gas was turned
off at 800 °C.

Transfer Graphene from Cu to the Arbitrary
Substrate
To transfer the graphene on a Ge substrate or graphene/AuNPs
on a
SiO2 substrate, the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution
(MicroChem Corp., 950 PMMA A5) was spin-coated on one side of the
as-synthesized graphene or graphene/AuNPs on Cu foil and graphene
on the other side was removed by using oxygen plasma (Femto Science,
COVANCE-MPR). Cu was then etched by using ammonium persulfate aqueous
solution and washed using DI water. The PMMA/graphene film was fished
by a Ge(110) or SiO2 substrate and heated at 180 °C
for 2 h in air. Finally, PMMA was removed by soaking in acetone and
annealed under Ar and H2 flow for 1 h.

Electrochemical
Current Measurements
A piece of Cu
foil was annealed at 1050 °C for 10 min to equate conditions
with the graphene/Cu sample. The electrochemical current measurements
were performed using a Versastat 3.0. To measure the accurate and
comparable current value, the electrochemical cell was designed to
have a hole, which has a specific area to measure from the same exposed
area. Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrode,
respectively. The scan rate was 0.2 point per second, and the bias
voltage was 0 V for 300 s.
