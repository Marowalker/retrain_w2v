Similarity searching (SS) is a core
approach in computational compound
screening and has a long tradition in pharmaceutical research. Over
the years, different approaches have been introduced to increase the
information content of search calculations and optimize the ability
to detect compounds having similar activity. We present a large-scale
comparison of distinct search strategies on more than 600 qualifying
compound activity classes. Challenging test cases for SS were identified
and used to evaluate different ways to further improve search performance,
which provided a differentiated view of alternative search strategies
and their relative performance. It was found that search results could
not only be improved by increasing compound input information but
also by focusing similarity calculations on database compounds. In
the presence of multiple active reference compounds, asymmetric SS
with high weights on chemical features of target compounds emerged
as an overall preferred approach across many different activity classes.
These findings have implications for practical virtual screening applications.

1 Introduction
Chemical similarity searching
(SS) using molecular fingerprints
is one of the mainstay methods in the chemoinformatics field1,2 and continues to be one of the most popular approaches for ligand-based
virtual screening.3−5 Fingerprints are bit string representations of molecular
structure and properties and produce molecule-specific linear bit
patterns.1,2 In SS, fingerprint representations of query
(reference) and target (database) compounds are compared using similarity
metrics, first and foremost, the Tanimoto coefficient (Tc).1 Fingerprint overlap is quantified as a measure
of molecular similarity.1,2 In virtual screening,
query compounds typically are known actives that are used to search
databases and rank database compounds according to decreasing similarity
to reference molecules.2 Calculated fingerprint
similarity is then used as an indicator of activity similarity.2 Despite its conceptual simplicity, SS has been
successful in many practical applications to identify novel active
compounds3−5 and often rivals computationally more complex screening
methods.6

A long-investigated issue
in SS has been the question of how to
best increase the information content of search calculations and maximize
the recall of active compounds in benchmark settings as well as the
identification of new chemical entities in prospective applications.2 Over the years, this question has been addressed
in methodologically different ways. One of the first approaches operates
at the level of reference compounds. Compared to search calculations
using single reference compounds, the use of multiple references usually
increases the recall of active compounds.7 These observations can be rationalized to result from neighborhood
behavior of similarity calculations.8 This
means that the use of multiple related yet distinct reference molecules
expands the chemical neighborhood of given active compounds and increases
the likelihood of identifying structurally variable target compounds
having similar activity. This neighborhood principle in virtual screening
even applies if additional reference molecules are used whose activity
status is unknown,9 as long as they are
sufficiently similar to known actives and complement their chemical
neighborhoods. The use of multiple reference molecules including similar
compounds with unknown activity states (presumed inactive compounds)
is referred to as “turbo” SS.9,10 This
term was coined in analogy to turbochargers that increase engine power
through the use of exhaust gases of an engine. Accordingly, turbo
similarity searching (TSS) is expected to increase search performance
by using inactive compounds that are structural neighbors of known
actives. If multiple reference compounds are used, regardless of their
activity states, data fusion techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) calculations must be applied
to merge the results for individual reference molecules and generate
a final similarity score.7,9 For example, in 5-NN
calculations, the five largest similarity values obtained for k reference molecules are averaged to yield the similarity
score of a given database compound, and in 1-NN calculations, the
largest of k values is chosen as the final score.

In addition to increasing the number of reference compounds, SS
can also be tuned by considering alternative similarity measures.11,12 For example, while Tc calculations are symmetrical in nature (i.e.,
the comparison of the fingerprint of molecule A to the one of B produces
the same similarity value as the comparison of B to A).1 By contrast, calculation of the Tversky index
(Tv)13 makes it possible to induce asymmetry
in similarity assessment. By appropriately adjusting weighting factors,
increasing weight can be put on molecular representations of query
or target compounds,2 as further discussed
below. For example, fingerprint settings of the reference compounds
might be preferentially weighted relative to those of database compounds
or vice versa.12

Another class of
methods addresses the issue of similarity search
information at the level of molecular representations. In so-called
fingerprint or bit profile scaling,14,15 bit patterns
of multiple reference compounds are compared, and consensus bits are
identified that are preferentially set on in reference molecules,
given a certain threshold (e.g., 80% of available references). Then,
a scaling factor (sf) is applied to consensus bits to increase their
relative impact on Tc calculations.14,15

Although
different categories of methods to increase the effectiveness
of SS have been individually explored in confined benchmark calculations,
these approaches have so far not been systematically compared. Therefore,
we have revisited the question of how to increase the information
content and effectiveness of SS through a large-scale analysis and
comparison of different strategies using hundreds of compound activity
classes, hence going far beyond typical benchmark settings. In particular,
we have been interested in addressing the question to what extent
increasing reference compound information or emphasizing characteristic
features of query and/or target compounds might contribute to similarity
search performance. In the following, the results of our systematic
investigation are presented.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Analysis Concept
Standard SS, TSS,
Tversky similarity searching (TvSS), and SS with scaled consensus
bits (CBSS) have been compared using varying numbers of reference
compounds. The CBSS approach is illustrated in Figure 1. We note that for structural fingerprints,
consensus bits can be mapped to reference and hit compounds, and the
resulting structural patterns can be interpreted. Such feature mapping
can identify important substructures in active compounds that determine
structure–activity relationships.16 For SS, TSS, and CBSS, the symmetrical Tc similarity metric was
applied. SS with single reference molecules served as a baseline for
search performance. Calculation details are provided in the Materials and Methods section. Initially, different
search strategies were applied to 609 qualifying compound activity
classes. On the basis of the results, a subset of 100 activity classes
was selected for which SS using single reference compounds approached
its limits (corresponding to randomly generated compound rankings).
Different search strategies were then compared in greater detail using
these “difficult” activity classes, which yielded a
further refined view of their relative performance.

Figure 1 SS with scaled consensus
bits. The CBSS approach is schematically
illustrated. Fingerprint features corresponding to consensus bits
(orange) may identify common substructures of reference compounds.
In this example, consensus bits delineate a coherent substructure
which can also be found in a hit compound.

We note that TvSS and CBSS depend on predefined parameter settings.
In the case of TvSS, these parameters include the α and β
factors that determine relative weights on the bit settings of reference
and database compounds, respectively, in Tv calculations. In CBSS,
parameters include the cut-off value for determining consensus bits
for a set of reference compounds (e.g., bits set on in at least eight
of 10 references, corresponding to a cut-off value of 80%) and the
sf that is applied to consensus bits in Tc calculations. An initial
systematic parameter search to optimize search performance for a sample
of activity classes revealed that there were no generally preferred
parameter settings, but that best parameters often varied for individual
classes, as one might expect. Therefore, alternative parameter settings
were applied, as further specified in the Materials
and Methods section.

2.2 Global Similarity Search
Comparison
All similarity-based compound rankings were evaluated
using the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC). Figure 2 shows boxplots of
mean AUC ROC for all 609 activity classes and different search strategies.
Boxplots were grouped by the number of reference compounds that were
used and color-coded according to different strategies and parameter
settings. All search strategies displayed an enrichment of correctly
identified active compounds at high ranks, as reflected by median
AUC ROC values of 0.7 or greater. With increasing number of reference
compounds, there was a general increase in search performance across
all strategies. For 20 reference compounds, mean AUC ROC values greater
0.9 were consistently observed. On a global scale, differences in
search performance between different strategies were only small, which
was attributed to averaging effects over many different activity classes.
Therefore, we next analyzed the distributions of activity classes
over different AUC ROC values for standard similarity search calculations
using increasing numbers of reference compounds. Figure 3 shows these distributions,
which again emphasize the strong gain in similarity search performance
when reference compound information was increasing. Hence, SS using
single reference compounds provided a baseline performance level.
The corresponding SS (1ref) AUC ROC distribution in Figure 3 had a mean value of 0.718
and a standard deviation of 0.122. Thus, an AUC ROC value of 0.6 corresponded
almost exactly to one standard deviation below the mean of the SS
(1ref) distribution (1σ = 0.596). Activity classes falling into
the AUC ROC interval [0.5, 0.6] were categorized as “difficult”
because standard SS approached its limits in these cases, with only
marginally better performance than random compound ranking (corresponding
to an AUC ROC value of 0.5). Thus, these classes represented challenging
test cases and were expected to benefit most from the application
of increasingly information-rich search strategies. Therefore, activity
classes falling into the AUC ROC interval [0.5, 0.6] were selected
for further analysis, yielding exactly 100 classes.

Figure 2 SS across all activity
classes. Boxplots show the distributions
of mean AUC ROC values for different similarity search strategies
across all 609 activity classes. Boxplots report the smallest value
(bottom line), first quartile (lower boundary of the box), median
value (thick line), third quartile (upper boundary of the box), and
largest value (top line). Data points below the bottom line or above
the top line represent statistical outliers.

Figure 3 Baseline
performance. Density plots report the distribution of
activity classes over AUC ROC values for SS using increasing numbers
of reference compounds. SS using single reference compounds represents
the baseline performance of all search calculations. Dashed red lines
mark the AUC ROC interval [0.5,0.6] for SS (1ref) into which 100 activity
classes fall. These classes were categorized as difficult test cases.

2.3 Search Results for Difficult
Activity Classes
Figure 4 shows boxplots
of mean AUC ROC values for the subset of 100 activity classes and
different search strategies. Compared to the global view, a much more
differentiated picture was obtained concerning the relative performance
of the different similarity search strategies. As expected, search
performance was generally lower for these activity classes. However,
for 20 reference compounds, median AUC ROC values above 0.8 were observed
in all cases except one, hence clearly indicating successful calculations.
Compared to SS, TSS did not provide a detectable advantage, although
larger numbers of references including “turbo” compounds
were used in each case. Hence, the search calculations were largely
determined by available active reference compounds, rather than additional
decoys. In this context, we note that previous investigations of TSS
were carried out on comparably small benchmark sets. By contrast,
clear differences were observed for TvSS calculations with an opposing
asymmetry and also for CBSS with different parameter settings. Notably,
(Tv-α = 0.01) calculations were consistently superior to (Tv-α
= 10), especially when fewer than 10 reference compounds were used.
For searches with single reference molecule, the median of the AUC
ROC distribution for (Tv-α = 10) was close 0.5 (random compound
ranking). However, for (Tv-α = 0.01), an increase in the median
exceeding 0.6 was observed. Furthermore, the (Tv-α = 0.01) strategy
also reached the overall largest median AUC ROC value exceeding 0.85
for 20 reference compounds. The results also showed that there was
overall no significant advantage of CBSS over SS and TSS when a large
sf of 5 or 10 was used. By contrast, the (CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05)
combination exceeded the search performance of SS, TSS, and CBSS with
other parameter settings.

Figure 4 SS across 100 difficult activity classes. Boxplots
report the distributions
of mean AUC ROC values for different similarity search strategies
across all 100 activity classes falling into the SS (1ref) AUC ROC
interval [0.5,0.6], according to Figure 2.

2.4 Preferred Search Strategies
Figure 4 shows that (Tv-α
= 0.01) and (CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05) were the overall best performing
search strategies. Performance advantages over other approaches were
largest for 5 or fewer reference compounds but also observed for 10
and 20 references, albeit by a smaller margin. This was an unexpected
finding because both approaches prioritized characteristics of target
compounds over reference molecules. In the case of (Tv-α = 0.01),
this was achieved by the asymmetric nature of the similarity calculations,
which put 100-fold more weight on the bit settings of database compounds
compared to the reference compounds. Corresponding effects were produced
by (CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05) through a special form of bit profile
scaling. In this case, all bits that were set on in fingerprints of
reference compounds were scaled down by their frequency (given sf
= 1) for Tc calculations. For example, if a bit was present in half
of the reference compounds, it was considered with a value of 0.5
during Tc calculations. Only bits consistently set on in all reference
compounds obtained a regular weight of 1. Thus, the (CBSS-sf = 1,
cut-off = 0.05) strategy de-emphasized bit settings of reference compounds
during Tc calculations, thus achieving a similar net effect as (Tv-α
= 0.01), which highly weighted bit settings of database compounds
during Tv calculations.

2.5 Structural Heterogeneity
Figure 5 (top) shows
the
distribution of scaffold-to-compound ratios for all activity classes
compared to the subset of 100 difficult classes. Scaffold-to-compound
ratios were calculated as a measure of intraclass structural heterogeneity.
A large scaffold-to-compound ratio indicates the presence of many
compounds with distinct core structures. Such structural heterogeneity
typically complicates SS. Hence, one might assume that activity classes
with low standard similarity search performance might simply be structurally
more diverse than others. However, the comparison of scaffold-to-compound
ratios in Figure 5 shows
that differences in search performance could not solely be attributed
to different degrees of structural heterogeneity because many difficult
classes fell into the area proximal to the mode of the global distributions.
Nonetheless, there was a tendency for classes with increasing scaffold-to-compound
ratio to yield reduced search performance, as also revealed in Figure 5 (bottom). The scatter
plot reports result for SS (20refs) while highlighting difficult classes
(selected on the basis of SS (1ref) calculations). However, the observation
that differences in similarity search performance could not simply
be attributed to varying degrees of structural heterogeneity among
active compounds emphasized the need for an in-depth analysis of relative
search performance using different strategies and relevant parameters.

Figure 5 Scaffold-to-compound
ratios and search performance. The diagram
at the top compares the global distribution of (nscaffold-to-ncompound) ratios
for all 609 activity classes (gray) to the distribution of the 100
classes with low SS (1ref) search performance (red). The scatter plot
at the bottom relates ratios of activity classes to SS (20refs) AUC
ROC values.

2.6 Focusing
on Target Compounds
For
any set of active reference compounds, the (Tv-α = 0.01) and
(CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05) strategies were found to be the generally
preferred approaches. Albeit methodologically distinct, these strategies
had in common that they emphasized characteristic features of target
compounds. Figure 6 shows mean Δ AUC ROC values for these strategies relative
to standard SS using three reference compounds for the subset of 100
activity classes. The results are representative for varying numbers
of reference compounds. For the majority of activity classes (87/100),
the performance of (Tv-α = 0.01) was superior to (CBSS-sf =
1, cut-off = 0.05), albeit often only by a slight margin. However,
comparing true positives among highly ranked database compounds for
different activity classes showed that these strategies often detected
overlapping yet distinct sets of active compounds, as illustrated
in Figure 7a. The overlap
between active compounds in the top 1% of the ranking generated using
the different search strategies is reported in Figure 7b. Hence, although asymmetric SS achieved
overall higher performance, both strategies were complementary in
detecting active compounds.

Figure 6 Comparison of preferred search strategies. Shown
is the change
in mean AUC ROC values for the (Tv-α = 0.01) and (CBSS-sf =
1, cut-off = 0.05) strategies using three reference compounds relative
to SS (3refs) for the 100 activity classes (each bar represents a
class). Five activity classes with largest reduction in search performance
relative to SS are numbered (1: neuropeptide Y receptor type 1 ligands,
2: PI3-kinase p110-delta subunit inhibitors, 3: tyrosine-protein kinase
receptor FLT3 inhibitors, 4: HERG inhibitors; 5: cytochrome P450 3A4
inhibitors).

Figure 7 Representative search results. (a) For two activity
classes, exemplary
reference molecules and highly ranked active compounds detected using
different search strategies according to Figure 6 are shown. (b) Venn diagrams show the overlap
in correctly identified active compounds within the top 1% of the
database rankings for the two search strategies.

Figure 7a also shows
that correctly identified active compounds using (Tv-α = 0.01)
had a tendency to be smaller and less complex than reference compounds
or were substructures of reference compounds. Preferential detection
of substructures of active compounds is a direct consequence of highly
weighted bit settings of database molecules. It follows that reduced
search performance of asymmetric SS with high weights on the bit settings
of database compounds relative to SS is likely to result from the
presence of potential hits that are larger and chemically more complex
than reference compounds. In such cases, putting high weights on the
bit settings of reference compounds reverses this tendency and favors
the detection of larger hits that contain reference compounds as substructures.
Differences in molecular size and complexity typically lead to differences
in fingerprint bit density.17 If fingerprints
of potential hits have higher bit density than those of reference
compounds, asymmetric SS with high weights on bit settings of reference
compounds favors the detection of such hits. Hence, molecular size
and complexity effects can be directly related to fingerprint bit
densities. Moreover, systematic differences in bit density between
active and inactive compounds also affect SS.17 Such bit density differences can also be exploited through asymmetric
SS with appropriate weights, leading, for example, to the preferential
de-selection of reference compounds having lower fingerprint bit density
than optimized active compounds.17

For the 100 activity classes, the median molecular weight of correctly
identified hits was 406.1 for SS, 392.1 for (CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off
= 0.05), and 386.2 for (Tv-α = 0.01). Furthermore, the median
potency of correctly identified hits was 670 nM, for SS, 790 nM for
(CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05), and 786 nM for (Tv-α = 0.01).

2.7 Concluding Remarks
In this work,
we have investigated alternative similarity search strategies on an
unprecedentedly large scale and analyzed their relative performance. Figure 7 illustrates that
different search strategies often detect overlapping yet distinct
sets of active compounds, which are essentially impossible to predict,
and hence emphasize the need for a detailed analysis of search calculations
and factors that determine their outcome. In accordance with our analysis
concept, identifying activity classes that provided challenging test
cases for standard SS and attempting to improve search performance
in these cases provided a differentiated picture of alternative methods
and strategies. The systematic search trials discussed above revealed
that the accuracy of SS could be improved by increasing reference
compound information as well as by emphasizing characteristic features
of target compounds. First, a general gain in search performance was
achieved when increasing numbers of active reference compounds were
used, which is intuitive and has been observed previously. Interestingly,
further expansion of reference neighborhoods through the addition
of turbo compounds had only little effects when assessed systematically.
Hence, characteristic features of compounds having a specific activity
were more important than adding decoys. Second, however, for any given
number of active reference compounds, the (Tv-α = 0.01) and
(CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05) search strategies emerged as best-performing
approaches. This was unexpected because these strategies emphasized
bit settings of target compounds, either directly through asymmetric
search calculations, (Tv-α = 0.01), or indirectly by de-emphasizing
bit settings of reference compounds, (CBSS-sf = 1, cut-off = 0.05).
By contrast, putting high weight on bit settings of reference molecules
through CBSS was less effective. Hence, the analysis revealed a dual
role of reference and target compound information for optimizing search
performance and identified preferred strategies for advanced SS. TvSS
with multiple reference compounds and high weights on target compounds
was the overall best approach across all activity classes and should
thus be an attractive choice for practical virtual screening applications.
Given the large number of activity classes that were investigated,
this strategy should be an attractive initial choice. Considering
the influence of both reference and target compounds on the search
results, asymmetric SS should generally be a preferred approach for
virtual screening because it makes it possible to carry out complementary
search trials, with high weights on reference or database compounds.
Importantly, if highly optimized active compounds from medicinal chemistry
are used as references, which is often the case, typical screening
hits are expected to be smaller and chemically less complex. Hence,
asymmetric SS with high weights on bit settings of database compounds,
the preferred strategy identified in our large-scale investigation,
favors the detection of such hits.

3 Materials
and Methods
3.1 Activity Classes
From ChEMBL (release
24),18 compound activity classes were extracted
that contained at least 100 compounds with available high-confidence
activity data for which the following selection criteria were applied:19

Species “Homo sapiens”, relationship type “D”, confidence score “9”,
target type “single protein”, activity type “Ki”
or “IC50”, activity relation “=”,
activity unit “nM”; if an activity comment “inactive”,
“inconclusive” or “not active” was detected,
the compound was removed.

On the basis of these selection criteria,
at total of 609 activity
classes comprising 259 099 unique compounds were obtained.
From compounds of each class, conventional Bemis–Murcko scaffolds20 were extracted and scaffold-to-compound ratios
per class determined as an indicator of intraclass structural diversity.
On the basis of these ratios, maximally diverse compound sets have
a value of 1 (i.e., each compound contains a unique scaffold/core
structure).

3.2 Molecular Representation
Compounds
were consistently represented as extended connectivity fingerprints
with bond diameter 4 (ECFP4),21 a preferred
fingerprint design for SS and other chemoinformatics applications.
ECFP4 is a feature set fingerprint consisting of layered atom environments
encoded using a hashing function. The size of the feature set is compound-dependent
but can be folded through modulo to yield a fingerprint with constant
number of bits per molecule. A folded 1024-bit version of ECFP4 was
generated using RDKit.22

3.3 Similarity Searching Setup
For each
search trial, 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 reference compounds were randomly
selected from each activity class. Then, the search was carried out
for the remaining active compounds per class using all other 608 activity
classes as the background database (representing potential false positives
in compound rankings). Each trial with a single or multiple reference
compounds was carried out 30 and 10 times, respectively, with independently
selected compounds, and search results were averaged. Calculations
with multiple reference compounds were carried out using 1-NN or k-NN data fusion selecting the largest similarity value
or the average of the similarity values of all reference compounds
as the final similarity score for each database compound, respectively.
We found that there were no significant differences in search performance
between 1-NN and k-NN calculations and hence report
the results of 1-NN calculations herein.

For all search strategies
except TvSS, fingerprint Tanimoto similarity was calculated. 1  

Equation 1 shows the
formula for calculating the Tc where A and B refer to the fingerprint
representations of query compound A and database compound B, respectively.
Tc is defined as the intersection of the fingerprints of A and B divided
by the union of the fingerprints A and B.

Database compounds
were ranked on the basis of decreasing similarity
scores to reference molecule(s). Rankings were evaluated using AUC
ROC calculations that relate true and false positive rates to each
other.23

For individual similarity
search strategies, specific calculations
were carried out, as described in the following.

3.3.1 Tversky
Similarity Searching
In
TvSS, Tc calculations are replaced with the asymmetric Tv similarity
measure, which makes it possible to differentially weigh the bit settings
of query and target compounds. 2  

Equation 2 shows the Tv formula. As above, A and B refer to the
fingerprints of reference compound A and target compound B. The α
and β weighting factors are used to introduce the asymmetry
into similarity calculations. For α = β = 1, Tv corresponds
to the symmetric Tc.

A systematic parameter search was carried
out for a subset of 30
activity classes and a total of 135 α-to-β ratios ranging
from 0.005 to 200 to identify ratios that maximized search performance.
While preferred values typically varied in a class-dependent manner,
combinations of (α = 0.01, β = 1) and (α = 10, β
= 1) were preferred in several instances and hence used for all activity
classes. In the former case, 100 times more weight was put on the
fingerprint settings of target (database) compounds, whereas in the
latter, 10 times more weight was put on reference compounds (given
a constantly set value of β = 1).

3.3.2 Turbo
Similarity Searching
For
TSS, an initial SS (1ref) search was carried out in the database to
identify nearest neighbors of chosen reference compounds, which were
then added to the reference set. For single reference compounds, the
top three or 10 neighbors were added for different search trials.
For multiple reference compounds (n = 3, 5, 10, or
20), the top n or 2n neighbors were
selected (yielding a maximum of 40 turbo compounds).

3.3.3 Similarity Searching with Consensus Bit
Scaling
For CBSS, consensus bits were determined on the basis
of their frequency in reference sets and subjected to scaling. For
example, if a cut-off value of 80% was applied and two bits were identified
that qualified as consensus bits, these bits were scaled taking their
reference set frequency into account. If one bit was set on in 80%
of the references and the other in 90%, applying a sf of 5 produced
an effective weight of 4.0 for the former and of 4.5 for the latter
during Tc calculations. Therefore, two parameters must be set including
the frequency cut-off for consensus bits and the sf applied to them
during Tc calculations. For CBSS, a parameter search was carried out
for a subset of 30 activity classes and sets of 5 reference compounds
to optimize search performance. Cut-off values ranging from 0.1 to
1.0 and sf ranging from 0 to 10 were investigated. For global search
calculations, (sf, cut-off) combinations were selected that yielded
high search performance in several cases including (5, 0.8), (10,
0.8), and (0.05, 1).
