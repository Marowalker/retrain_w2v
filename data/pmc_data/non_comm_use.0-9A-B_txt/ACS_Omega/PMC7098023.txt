This
study was focused on the geometries and properties of the structural
isomers obtained from a random walk of methylpentynol–HN3 clusters. The theoretical aspects of hydrogen bonding effects
on the discussed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (1,3-DC) reactions [between
methylpentynol (a) as a dipolarophile and azide (b) as a 1,3-dipole] have shown regioselective output concepts.
The dipolarophile methylpentynol (a) was applied for
the treatment of insomnia. Both methylpentynol (a) and
azide (b) can be H-bond acceptor and H-bond donor agents.
Because of this trait of them, structures of H-bonding arrays (c–f) and methylpentynol–azide clusters (g–m) can be probable. In this work, regioselectivity
of the 1,3-DC reaction [between methylpentynol (a) as
a dipolarophile and azide (b) as a 1,3-dipole] was determined
based on these structures (c–m) using density
functional theory (DFT). The energy levels of the reactants (a and b) and the structures of H-bonding arrays
(c–f), methylpentynol–azide clusters (g–m), transition states, and products (1 and 2) were studied, and also, the free energies of
the reaction (ΔrG and ΔG#, in kcal mol–1) and rate
constants were determined using Eyring’s equation (k). Structural data were calculated and obtained by the
DFT/B3LYP method. Seven different basis sets have been used to obtain
the most appropriate results from comparison of data.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
type of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (1,3-DC) reactions has been widely
used in various fields.1,2 A lot of reports in the scientific
literature have devoted to 1,3-DC reactions because of their interesting
features and their products such as 1,2,3-triazole.3 The five-membered hetero-aromatic rings, which could be
achieved by 1,3-DC reactions, widely played an important role in various
biochemical processes.4

Stereochemistry
in these reactions is one of the important spotlights.2 The focus of attention has been attracted on the regio-,
diastereo-, and enantioselectivity of 1,3-DC reactions, which were
rationalized through frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory.5−10 Choosing the appropriate substrates and electron-donating or electron-withdrawing
functional groups that are located on the reagents can lead to the
intended stereochemistry in these types of organic reactions. This
stereoselectivity would occur by altering the relative FMO energies.
It should be noted that another influential factor for selectivity
is steric restraint effects, which has been known as a substantial
factor.1,5,11,12 This demand was also realized by the purposeful use
of some special catalysts. The “canonical” 1,3-DC reaction
of terminal alkynes and azides was dramatically accelerated by the
Cu(I) catalyst which was first reported by Sharpless and co-workers13 and Meldal and co-workers as a click chemistry
approach.14 The copper ion catalyzes the
1,3-DC reactions and yields regioselectively in the 1,4-disubstituted
triazole ring. Therefore, several catalysts have been pursued to expand
the application of this reaction by forming the 1,5-disubstituted
product.11 This goal was recently achieved
using ruthenium-based catalysts.15 However,
the obtained research data on the regioselectivity performance of
1,3-DC reactions have not been reported using H-bonding arrays with
a topology of the cluster. Herein, regioselectivity has been attained
by “silico modeling” via hydrogen-bonding networks (HBNs).
In 1920, the term of hydrogen bonds was used in the literature for
the first time.16 The following form was
applied to represent the isolated hydrogen bond in HBNs (X is an electronegative
element and Y is a basic site):17

The evolution of hydrogen-bonding concepts keeps extending over time;18−21 nowadays, hydrogen bonds are considered one of the most important
noncovalent interactions.16,22 Although the structures
of the isolated hydrogen bonds were discussed before, the main principles
of topology in isolated H bonding may be useful for the application
of H-bonding clusters to investigate the construction of the structures.23,24 One of the first articles about water clusters was published in
1969,25 and also, one of the first articles
about HBNs was published in 1979 which dealt with the issue of how
hydration water molecules and hydroxyl groups of macromolecules can
cooperate to form a network-like pattern.26 However, such data could be grouped into gas-phase clusters. In
a low-temperature gas-phase environment, this cluster on the HBNs
has provided important information related to the structure of the
cluster geometry.27−29 Extensive studies have been performed on water cluster
structures and alcohol; as a result, a large amount of data on properties
of clusters has appeared in the literature.24,30−41 These interests notably direct researchers’ attention toward
clusters of different alcohols.36 As previously
mentioned, in the X–H···:Y form of the hydrogen
bond, X is an electronegative atom which comes from group IV–VII
atoms. The halogen bond is a kind of hydrogen bond where the X atom
is from group VII. This type has also been taken into consideration.42−44

In this investigation, methylpentynol (a) molecules
were converged in a cluster of azide molecules (b) using
an H-bonding array framework. The estimates of some arrays of methylpentynol–HN3 clusters will be presented here. The obtained data were calculated
by the density functional theory (DFT)/B3LYP method. Parallel calculations
at seven different basis sets were performed for all structures of
reactants (a and b), H-bonding arrays (c, d, and f), methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m), and products (1 and 2) for comparison. The reaction is presented in Scheme 1. In Figure 1, the schematic of the 1,3-DC reaction between
methylpentynol (a) and azide (b) to achieve
products (2) using an H-bonding array (c) has been shown as a sequential process.

2 Results
and Discussion
In the present work, there are two options
to calculate ΔG# and ΔrG for the product (2). The first
assumption is that there will be no interactions between the reactants
before the 1,3-DC reaction. Meanwhile, in the second assumption, H-bonding
arrays are being exhibited as reactants in the 1,3-DC reaction. The
results of the reaction have shown that the species “c” and “d” as the precursor
of the discussed reaction are more stable than the sum of the energies
of “a” and “b”
initiator ingredients because of hydrogen bonding between the reaction
initiator in “c” and “d”. Because the formation of the H bond is with relative stability,
the reactants tend to form the discussed H-bonding arrays and clusters.
The computational results of the reaction demonstrated that the energy
level of the “e” form is higher than what
it should be possible to follow the reaction (see Scheme 1).

2.1 Structural
Remarks and Topology of H-Bonding Networks
Any electron-rich
group has been determined as an acceptor, so H-bonding arrays can
be mapped out in three modes (c–e). Methylpentynol (a) can act as an acceptor of two
hydrogen bonds and a donor of one hydrogen bond. With methylpentynol
(M), azide (A), nA + M (MAn), and n = 2, two structures are conceivable:
“f” (the open-chain structure with 2-docking
N–H···:O) and “g”
(3-fold).

However, about n ≥ 3 clusters
with equal number of azides have a circular arrangement, in which
docking is obvious in one of them: “h”
(3-fold and docking), “i” (4-fold), “j” (4-fold and docking), “k”
(5-fold), “l” (5-fold and docking), and
“m” (6-fold).

The structural data
[angle of X–H···:Y (°) and H-bond length
of X–H···:Y (Å)] and topologies of H-bonding
arrays (c, d, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m), which are obtained from calculations
with seven different basis sets, are categorized in Tables 1 and 2. Because the polarization functions give more room for the electrons
to get away from each other to minimize electron–electron repulsion,
the augmented basis sets give remarkably good calculated geometries
which can give results comparable to the simple basis sets.

The main interest of the DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p)
method lies in the fact that it is more flexible and gives geometry
optimization with high accuracy. Therefore, all used topology pictures
given in Table 2 were
obtained by DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) (see Tables 1, S1 and S2). Table S1 demonstrates the HBN topologies of the
methylpentynol–azide clusters (f–m) which
were obtained by DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p). Table S2 shows the H-bond length (Å) and angle (°) of N–H···:O
and O–H···:N in methylpentynol–azide
clusters (f–m).

2.2 “X–H···:Y”
Distances and Suitable Binding
The H-bond lengths (Å)
and the H-bond angle (°) of the host–guest relations of
N–H···:O and O–H···:N
for H-bonding arrays (c, d, and f) and methylpentynol–azide clusters (g–m) are depicted in Tables 1 and 2. However, there are three graphs
and two figures embedded in Table 1 to schematically compare “c”
and “d” arrays. Almost all methods show
great evidence. The trend of reviews from the first basis set to the
seventh basis set shows that the methods which have diffuse “s” and “p” functions for
heavy atoms presented more acceptable results. Furthermore, more evolved
results are obtained by expanding the polarization functions in methods.

The comparison of the depicted results from seven different basis
sets in Table 1 shows
that the interactions of the H bond in the “c”
array (N–H···:O) are more appropriate than the
interactions of the H bond in the “d” array
(O–H···:N). In almost all results, the values
of the angle of N–H···:O (°) [c] are significantly
larger than the values of the angle of O–H···:N
(°) [d]. Therefore, the angle of N–H···:O
(°) [c] tends to 180°. The bond angles of N–H···:O
(°) [c] and O–H···:N (°) [d] were
176.41 and 175.30° (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* method); 175.77 and
174.41° (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G** method); 176.18 and 175.57°
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G* method); 177.99 and 176.68° (in the
DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G* method); 177.54 and 176.30° (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G**
method); 177.54 and 176.30° (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G** method);
and 176.70 and 176.79° (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) method),
respectively. The H-bond length of N–H···:O
(Å) [c] in all methods was clearly lower than the H-bond length
of O–H···:N (Å) [d]. The H-bond lengths
of N–H···:O (Å) [c] and O–H···:N
(Å) [d] were 1.932 and 2.044 Å (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G*
method); 1.927 and 2.049 Å (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G** method);
1.938 and 2.033 Å (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G* method); 1.927 and
2.045 Å (in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G* method); 1.936 and 2.053 Å
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G** method); 1.936 and 2.053 Å (in the
DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G** method); and 1.967 and 2.073 Å [in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)
method], respectively. This perception of H bonds is based on geometry
and energy of N–H···:O and O–H···:N
in the discussed system, which could be ascribed to a rather negative
electrostatic charge of the oxygen atom (Oδ−). Two nonbonded electron pairs of oxygen atoms were considered to
be immediate acceptors of the hydrogen bond, which is also expected
to play a definite role in determining the geometrical arrangement
in the HBNs.

Looking at the computational results of basis sets,
from the first (6-31G*) to the seventh (6-31++G(2df,2p)), the downward
trends in system stability for both “c”
(N–H···:O form of the H bond) and “d” (O–H···:N form of the H bond)
are quite evident (see Table 1). The values of stability of the structure (because of the
H bond) for N–H···:O [c] and O–H···:N
[d] (in kcal mol–1) were −7.945 and −4.904
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* method); −7.797 and −4.798
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G** method); −7.433 and −5.087
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G* method); −6.618 and −4.538
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G* method); −5.822 and −3.950
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G** method); −5.812 and −3.943
(in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G** method); and −5.110 and −3.287
[in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) method], respectively. Also, these
trends are entirely continuous for other structures of clusters (f–m). The comprehensive data about the stability of
structure energy are shown in Table 3. If you would like to see these trends for the stability
of structure energy per number of H bonds, the data are available
in Table 4.

2.3 Characterization
of the Methylpentynol–Azide Clusters’ Potential Energy
Surfaces
Here, we have presented level benchmark calculations
of the interaction energies of the H-bonding cluster structures constituting
methylpentynol–azide clusters to achieve the regiochemical
outcome of 1,3-DC reactions. The obtained results highlighted the
importance of the diffuse basis set functions for the accurate prediction
of the energy data using the DFT functional. In terms of 6-31+G*,
the functions of polarization and diffuse were just added to the heavier
atoms. The basis set 6-31++G** puts the functions of polarization
and diffuse on the hydrogen atoms as well. The results from 6-31+G*
may be similar to those obtained with 6-31++G**, if the interactions
do not involve hydrogen bonding (except for the lower absolute energies).

Tables 3 and 4 include the three-dimensional diagrams. The three
dimensions are (1) the cluster structure energy per H bonds (kcal
mol–1), (2) the applied basis sets in the benchmark
calculations of the interaction energies of the H-bonding cluster
structures, and (3) the cluster structures state (c to m) energy (in Table 4, this part was calculated and shown for per H bonds).

As briefly mentioned in the previous section, the H bond is along
with relative stability for all studied cluster structures. Furthermore,
the results depicted in Table 3 have shown the willingness of a downward trend of the cluster
structure energy in each azide addition step, which means increase
in the stability of the cluster structure. Eq 1 was applied to calculate the results shown
in Table 3. 1  

The results shown in Table 4 are based on the assumption that there is equal stability
energy for all types of H bonds in H-bonding arrays (c, d, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m). Therefore, to achieve the data
given in Table 4, the
recorded data in Table 3 were divided based on number of H bonds in the structures.

Because of the results shown in Tables 3 and 4, it is possible
to compare the seven used basis sets. The potential energies are explicitly
sensitive to the basis set choice, but their change trends are almost
the same for all clusters. In review of the basis sets from the first
(1: 6-31G*; the simplest) to the seventh [7: 6-31++G(2df,2p); the
most augmented], the observations are as follows:

In the comparison
of (1) 6-31G* and (2) 6-31G** (in which 2: 6-31G** added “p” polarization functions for hydrogen to 1: 6-31G*),
the results change somewhat toward the benchmark method [DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)
method]. However, these changes are minor. The obtained ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these two basis
sets (1: 6-31G* and 2: 6-31G**) for H-bonding arrays (d, c, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m) is as follows (see Table 3): 0.106 (for “d”); 0.148 (for “c”); 0.195
(for “f”); 0.336 (for “g”); 0.469 (for “h”); 0.447 (for
“i”); 0.481 (for “j”); 0.451 (for “k”); 0.586 (for
“l”); and 0.437 (for “m”).

In the comparison of (1) 6-31G* and (3) 6-311G*
[in which 3: 6-311G* is a split-valence triple-zeta basis that added
one Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) to 1: 6-31G], the results for “d”, “i”, “j”, “k”, “l”,
and “m” become more distant from those
of the benchmark method (DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) method). These
distances of the obtained ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these two basis sets (1: 6-31G* and 3: 6-311G*)
for “d”, “i”,
“j”, “k”, “l”, and “m” are as follows
(see Table 3): 0.289
(for “d”); 0.602 (for “i”); 0.144 (for “j”); 1.250 (for
“k”); 0.496 (for “l”); and 2.193 (for “m”).

In the comparison of (1) 6-31G* and (4) 6-31+G* (in which 4: 6-31+G*
added diffuse “s” and “p” functions for nonhydrogen atoms to 1: 6-31G*), the results
show significant changes toward the benchmark method (DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)
method). The obtained ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these two basis sets (1: 6-31G* and 4: 6-31+G*) for H-bonding
arrays (d, c, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m) is as follows (see Table 3): 0.260 (for “d”); 1.179 (for “c”); 1.784
(for “f”); 2.286 (for “g”); 3.188 (for “h”); 2.372 (for
“i”); 3.368 (for “j”); 2.937 (for “k”); 3.799 (for
“l”); and 2.864 (for “m”). The significant differences between results of the (1)
6-31G* basis set and results of the (4) 6-31G* basis set could be
ascribed to a rather negative electrostatic charge (δ–) of the involved electronegative atoms in the HBNs, which is also
expected to play a decisive role.

As mentioned before, the methods
which have diffuse “s” and “p” functions for heavy atoms presented more acceptable
results. Therefore, the last four methods [4: 6-31+G*, 5: 6-311+G**,
6: 6-311++G**, and 7: 6-31++G(2df,2p)] are more acceptable. Because
of the comparison of (1) 6-31G* and (4) 6-31+G*, which showed that
the 6-31+G* basis set is more acceptable, the DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G* method
is the basis for comparisons of the last four methods.

In the
comparison of (4) 6-31+G* and (5) 6-311+G** (in which 5: 6-311+G**
added “p” polarization functions for hydrogen
and one GTO to 4: 6-31+G*), the results show significant changes toward
the benchmark method [DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) method]. The obtained
ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these
two basis sets (4: 6-31+G* and 5: 6-311+G**) for H-bonding arrays
(d, c, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m) is as follows (see Table 3): 0.588 (for “d”); 0.796 (for “c”); 1.997
(for “f”); 1.633 (for “g”); 2.613 (for “h”); 2.029 (for
“i”); 3.233 (for “j”); 1.955 (for “k”); 3.760 (for
“l”); and 2.056 (for “m”).

In the comparison of (4) 6-31+G* and (6) 6-311++G**
(in which 6: 6-311++G** added diffuse functions for hydrogen, “p” polarization functions for hydrogen, and one GTO
to 4: 6-31+G*), the results show significant changes toward the benchmark
method [DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) method]. The obtained ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these two basis
sets (4: 6-31+G* and 6: 6-311++G**) for H-bonding arrays (d, c, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m) is as follows (see Table 3): 0.595 (for “d”); 0.806 (for “c”); 2.000
(for “f”); 1.631 (for “g”); 2.547 (for “h”); 2.003 (for
“i”); 3.193 (for “j”); 1.934 (for “k”); 3.691 (for
“l”); and 1.971 (for “m”).

In the comparison of (4) 6-31+G* and (7) 6-311++G(2df,2p)
(in which 7: 6-311++G(2df,2p) added one set of “d” polarization functions and one set of “f” polarization functions to nonhydrogen atoms and also two
sets of “p” polarization functions to hydrogen
atoms; furthermore, it added diffuse functions for hydrogen also,
to 4: 6-31+G*), the results show considerable changes. The obtained
ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these
two basis sets [4: 6-31+G* and 7: 6-311++G(2df,2p)] for H-bonding
arrays (d, c, and f) and methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m) is as follows (see Table 3): 1.251 (for “d”); 1.508 (for “c”); 3.083
(for “f”); 3.339 (for “g”); 4.817 (for “h”); 5.022 (for
“i”); 6.663 (for “j”); 5.949 (for “k”); 8.187 (for
“l”); and 6.969 (for “m”).

The comparison of (5) 6-311+G** and (6) 6-311++G**
(in which 6: 6-311++G** added diffuse functions for hydrogen to 5:
6-311+G**) shows almost identical results with high correlation because
the diffuse functions for hydrogen do not have an effect on the results
of calculations for these clusters in the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G** method.
This was predictable because of the absence of negative charges on
the hydrogen atoms in these clusters; however, the sixth method was
also used in the calculations to report the results and compare the
data. The obtained ΔE (in kcal mol–1) from these two basis sets (5: 6-311+G** and 6: 6-311++G**) for
H-bonding arrays (d, c, & f) and methylpentynol–azide clusters (g–m) is as follows (see Table 3): 0.007 (for “d”); 0.010 (for
“c”); 0.003 (for “f”); 0.002 (for “g”); 0.066 (for
“h”); 0.026 (for “i”); 0.040 (for “j”); 0.021 (for
“k”); 0.069 (for “l”); and 0.085 (for “m”).

In these comparisons [e.g., in the comparison of 1: 6-31G* and 2:
6-31G**, the comparison of 4: 6-31+G* and 5: 6-311+G**, and the comparison
of 4: 6-31+G* and 7: 6-311++G(2df,2p)], the observations show that
the polarization functions have significant effects on the results.
The results of the comparison of (5) 6-311+G** and (6) 6-311++G**
clearly show that calculations are not affected by diffuse functions
for hydrogen. However, the DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) method was used
as the benchmark method because of its flexibility in all aspects
including large polarization functions and diffuse functions for all
atoms.

As could be seen, the three-dimensional diagram shown
in Table 3 has demonstrated
a harmony in its convergence and integration, which shows the reliable
relationships between the applied methods and basis sets in the applied
benchmark calculations of the interaction energies of the H-bonding
cluster structures.

2.4 Dipole Moment
The dipole moment surfaces (DMSs) for methylpentynol–azide
clusters are constructed as a sum of DMSs for each cluster components.
The dipole moment vector of each methylpentynol–azide cluster
is represented as a vector sum of effective charges on all involved
atoms. The fit expression of the dipole moment vector must be covariant
with respect to all permutations of like atoms; that is, it must transform
such as a vector under permutations of like atoms. The dipole moments
(Debye) of methylpentynol (a) calculated using six basis
sets are (1) 1.24, 6-31G* basis set; (2) 1.16, 6-31G** basis set;
(3) 1.32, 6-311G* basis set; (4) 1.24, 6-31+G* basis set; (5) 1.21,
6-311+G** basis set; and (6) 1.21, 6-311++G** basis set. Furthermore,
these amounts are 1.96, 2.00, 2.03, 2.03, 1.88, and 1.87 for azide
(b), respectively. The full DMSs of H-bonding arrays
(c–f) and methylpentynol–azide clusters
(g–m), which were calculated using six basis sets,
are shown in Table 5. In this investigation, H bonds (N–H···:O)
in the docking position play a clearly crucial role in the DMS (see Table 5). The results about
“d”, “g”, “i”, “k”, and “m” structures that have no N–H···:O
type of H bonds in the docking position have shown lower values. The
dipole moment amounts of “c”, “h”, “j”, and “l” structures that have N–H···:O
type of H bonds in the docking position have shown greater values.
However, the dipole moment amount of the “f”
structure showed the highest value. The dipole moment
amount of the “f” structure in DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G*
is 5.78 debye, which is the highest one.

2.5 Thermodynamic and Kinetic Data
The investigation of
the cluster structure energy per H bond (see Table 4) showed that the “c”
H-bond array (N–H···:O) has the highest amount
of stability. However, the “d” H-bond array
(O–H···:N) is the most unstable mode in the
components of the reaction (see Table 4). Therefore, the “d” H-bond
array (O–H···:N) is more suitable than the “c” H-bond array (N–H···:O) to
react.

Scheme 1 illustrates the overall pattern of the reaction energy diagram (shown
right) and the structure of the reactants (a and b), H-bonding arrays (c–e), products (1 and 2), and TSs (shown left). The obtained
data calculated by the DFT/B3LYP method and the used basis sets were
as follows: (1) 6-31G*, (2) 6-31G**, (3) 6-311G*, (4) 6-31+G*, (5)
6-311+G**, (6) 6-311++G**, and (7) 6-31++G(2df,2p). In Figure 2, the schematic diagram of
the 1,3-DC reaction between methylpentynol (a) and azide
(b) to achieve the product (2) using the
“d” H-bond array (O–H···:N)
was shown. The used data were calculated using seven different basis
sets.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the 1,3-DC reaction between methylpentynol (a) and azide (b) to achieve the product (2) using the “d” H-bond array (O–H···:N).

There is almost similar behaviors in the diagrams
in Figure 2, on the
basis of the obtained results by the benchmark calculations of the
interaction energies of the H-bonding cluster structures constituting
methylpentynol–azide clusters to achieve the regiochemical
outcome of 1,3-DC reactions. However, there are some discussable results.
The energy level of the precursors was obtained as the lowest and
more stable states using the 6-311G* basis set (light blue line) in
comparison with the other applied basis sets. Despite the fact that
the energy level of the TS form was more stable than that of DFT-B3LYP/6-311++G**
(red line) and DFT-B3LYP/6-311+G** (green line) by the DFT-B3LYP/6-311G*
method, the lowest energy level for the TS form was obtained by DFT-B3LYP/6-31G*
(gray line), and the energy level of the precursors was also obtained
with a bit difference with DFT-B3LYP/6-311G* (light blue line). The
obtained results for DFT-B3LYP/6-311++G** (red line) and DFT-B3LYP/6-311+G**
(green line) methods are almost the same and/or very near together.
Therefore, on the basis of the obtained results, the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G*
(gray line) has shown the lowest energy level for the TS state and
almost admissible results for the energy level of the precursors in
the interaction energies of the H-bonding cluster structures constituting
methylpentynol–azide clusters to achieve the regiochemical
outcome of 1,3-DC reactions.

In fact, it is evident that the
6-31++G(2df,2p) basis set is the most comprehensive. Eventually, the
“d” H-bond array (O–H···:N)
and DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) method were selected as two main items
to calculate the thermodynamic (ΔrG and ΔG# in kcal mol–1) and kinetic (rate constants = k in M–1 s–1) data. Eqs 2–4 were applied to calculate
details, which are summarized in Table 6. The DFT-calculated results demonstrated that the
form “c” is 5.111 and 1.824 kcal mol–1 more stable than “a + b” and “d”, respectively. Because
of H bonding, the [TS]2 is 2.386
kcal mol–1 more stable than the [TS]1 from the reaction of “a + b” (see Scheme 1 and Table 6).

a In these cases, there is no H bonding
between the precursors. However, in the real states, H bonding takes
place between the species.

2.6 HOMO and LUMO and Regioselectivity
Although there is
a regioselective
orientation for all studied cluster structures [the H-bonding arrays
(c, d, and f) and the methylpentynol–azide
clusters (g–m)], examination of the topologies
shows that each azide in the studied structures has different positions.
Also, depending on the stability of structures and structure energy
of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO), there is a different reactivity for each
studied structure. In earlier structural evidence, it was observed
that the “d” H-bond array (O–H···:N)
is preferable to other cluster structures in terms of energy and topology.

Herein, the energy (eV) of the HOMO and LUMO (Table 7) is studied to compare the
reactivity of cluster structures. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels
of the discussed clusters have demonstrated the softness and hardness
(acid–base interactions). Also, the HOMO–LUMO energy
gaps show the gap between the acid–base interactions in the
discussed cluster H-bonding. The lowest energy gap of HOMO–LUMO
among the data shown in Table 7 was identified for the “d” H-bond
array (O–H···:N) with 5.63 eV, which means that
the “d” H-bond array (O–H···:N)
is a more suitable case for the discussed reaction.

a Mulliken charge of carbon atoms of acetylene. .

b The data are just for methylpentynol (a).

2.7 Mulliken
Charge and Regioselectivity
The results have shown that the
interplay between cooperative hydrogen bonding and a Mulliken charge
of carbon atoms of acetylene may be an efficient theme in regioselectivity
in this reaction. During the formation of HBNs (depicted in Table 7 and Figure 3), significant shifts were
observed in the Mulliken charge of carbon atoms of acetylene for “d” and “g”. Because of this
function, it may lead to more regioselectivity in the 1,4-product
(2) formation and the facility of the simultaneous reaction would
increase.

Figure 3 Orbital energy (eV) of the HOMO and LUMO and the Mulliken charge
of some atoms, related to DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) (pictured left);
the property range for the electrostatic potential map is from −172.242
to 243.491 (kJ mol–1) and the dipole moment vector
(μ: 2.40 debye), related to DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G** (pictured right).

The amount of the difference between the values
of Mulliken charges of acetylene carbon atoms (Δε(a.u.)) was calculated in all structures including methylpentynol
by the DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) method. These amounts are impressive,
ranging from 0.232 to 0.344. The biggest amounts of the Mulliken charge
differences were obtained for “d” (0.343
a.u.) and “g” (0.344 a.u.).

3 Conclusions
In this study, components as free molecules
(a) and (b), the arrays of HBNs (c–f), and methylpentynol–azide clusters (g–m) were investigated. The clusters and orientations of the molecules
beside each other have not been investigated before as the certain
affecting factor on the regioselectivity of the 1,3-DC reaction. Increasing
the size of the intended system increases the computational requirements,
which causes lots of restrictions in carrying out quantum chemical
calculations for involved systems with very large numbers of molecules.
Here, a thermodynamic predicted model has examined the orientation
on the modeled structures. Also, the geometries and properties of
some methylpentynol–HN3 clusters were presented.
The obtained results clearly showed that there was a close correlation
between the H-bonding effect and the formation of the methylpentynol–HN3 clusters. Regioselectivity was easily predicted using all
examined structures, but this issue was more significant in the case
of the “d” H-bond array (O–H···:N)
consisting of one methylpentynol and one azide molecule. With regard
to the results of this study, it seems that the use of a limited amount
of the reactant (a) could be a regioselectivity pathway.

4 Computational Method
The simulation of gas-phase methylpentynol–azide
clusters based on HBNs was the first step of the present study. This
goal was complemented with determining the preferred structures [methylpentynol
(M), azide (A), and nA + M (MAn); 1 ≤ n ≤ 5]. The calculations
were conducted on a comprehensive set of methylpentynol–HN3 clusters.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculation
was performed in this investigation. The DFT calculations reported
were carried out using the Spartan ‘10 package.45 The B3LYP (the combination of the new Becke’s
exchange potential46 and the nonlocal correlation
functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr47) method
was applied for calculations. All the accepted geometric arrangements
were optimized based on seven different basis sets. The used basis
sets are as follows: (1) 6-31G*, (2) 6-31G**, (3) 6-311G*, (4) 6-31+G*,
(5) 6-311+G**, (6) 6-311++G**, and (7) 6-31++G(2df,2p). For more information
about basis sets, view ref (48).

The compared structural data of calculations and
all structures’ geometries are shown in the comprehensive tabulations.
Data show that there is only a small difference between DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G**
and DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G**. The absence of the negative charge on the
hydrogen atoms is the nature and origin of this similarity in these
methods for clusters in this study. DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G** has diffuse
“s” and “p”
functions for nonhydrogen atoms and diffuse functions for hydrogen
as well, so it is not economical in terms of time. However, this method
was used to make a comparison between the data. DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p)
is a method with high accuracy because it covers all aspects. This
method has a more flexible and larger basis set with two sets of “d” polarization functions and one set of “f” polarization functions to nonhydrogen atoms and
also two sets of “p” polarization functions
to hydrogen atoms; furthermore, it has diffuse “s” and “p” functions for heavy atoms
(atoms other than H and He) and diffuse functions for hydrogen as
well. Thus, using this method can be beneficial to evaluate the thermodynamic
(ΔrG and ΔG# in kcal mol–1) and kinetic (rate constants
= k in M–1 s–1 and log k) data of the 1,3-DC reactions of methylpentynol
(a) with azide (b).

The TSs were optimized
based on the discussed Huisgen reaction, which introduces a concerted
mechanism. The principal demand was the rate constants of reactions
that were obtained using the Eyring equation, in agreement with the
TS theory49 2  where k is the reaction rate constant, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is
the absolute temperature, h is Planck’s constant,
ΔG# is the Gibbs energy of activation,
and R is the gas constant. All inputs are constant
and only free activation energies (ΔG#) are variable, which were achieved as follows 3  

In addition, the free energy changes
of the reactions (ΔrG) were achieved
at 298.15 K using the following equation 4  

The computations of the ground states, energies
of the HOMO and LUMO, and the ΔEHOMO–LUMO of product structures of the suggested molecules in vacuum have
been performed by the DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) method. The structures
of the precursor, TSs, and the 1,3-DC process to receive the product
derivatives have been computed. The graphs and the related tables
demonstrate the appropriate data.
