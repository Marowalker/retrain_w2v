In
this report, the novel and site-specific radioiodination of
biomolecules by using aryl diamine and alkyl aldehyde condensation
reaction in the presence of a Cu2+ catalyst under ambient
conditions was reported. 125I-labeled alkyl aldehyde was
synthesized using a tin precursor with a high radiochemical yield
(72 ± 6%, n = 5) and radiochemical purity (>99%).
The utility of the radioiodinated precursor was demonstrated through
aryl diamine-installed c[RGDfK(C)] peptide and human serum albumin
(HSA). Radioiodinated c[RGDfK(C)] peptide and HSA protein were synthesized
with high radiochemical yields and purity. 125I-HSA protein
showed excellent in vivo stability and negligible
thyroid uptake as compared with directly radioiodinated HSA by using
the tyrosine group. Excellent reaction kinetics and the in
vitro and in vivo stabilities of 125I-labeled alkyl aldehyde have suggested the usefulness of the strategy
for the radioiodination of bioactive molecules.

Introduction
Among the various available
radioisotopes, radioiodine is the most
extensively used for radiolabeling of biologically active macro and
micromolecules.1−3 Radioiodine can be used for positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging (124I),4 singlephoton
emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging (123/125I),5,6 treatment of various cancers (131I),7 and pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies of newly
designed therapeutic drugs (125I).8−10 Several methodologies
have been reported in the literature for the efficient and chemoselective
radioiodination of biomolecules.11,12 The most frequently
used strategy is direct radioiodination via the tyrosine group in
the selected peptides and proteins by using some strong oxidizing
agents.13 The use of an electrophilic aromatic
substitution reaction on the tyrosine group provides a high radiochemical
yield within a short time.14 However, radioiodine
attached to biomolecules are usually unstable inside a living body.
In vivo deiodination and the accumulation of free radioiodine in the
blood, thyroid, and other organs results in a high background signal
and poor image quality.15 Moreover, strong
oxidizing agents can damage and/or alter the bioactivity of radiolabeled
biomolecules.16 To address these issues,
many radioiodinated maleimide and N-succinimidyl
ester-based prosthetic groups have been synthesized for thiol and
amino group coupling reactions, respectively (Scheme 1).17−19 Unfortunately, these prosthetic
groups cannot provide chemoselective, fast, and high-yield radiolabeling.16 Recently, conventional bioconjugation methods
including radioiodinated azide–alkyne cycloaddition,20 Staudinger–Bertozzi ligation,21 and inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder
ligation between trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-conjugated biomolecules and
radioiodinated tetrazine were utilized for radioiodination.22 The bioconjugation reactions based on azide–alkyne
cycloaddition and Staudinger–Bertozzi ligation demonstrated
slow reaction kinetics. The reaction between TCO and radioiodinated
tetrazine is fast but it provides a mixture of radioiodinated products,
which may not be acceptable to regulatory authorities for clinical
application.22 Therefore, the search for
more efficient, easy to apply, and clean bioconjugation reactions
is still in demand to satisfy diverse applications. Moreover, expansion
can provide additional and better choices when multiple reactions
are used to modify the biomolecules.

For several
decades, benzimidazole molecules have been widely applied
in organic synthesis, and various strategies have been developed for
the construction of benzimidazole.23−26 Previously published reports
have suggested that o-phenylenediamine and alkyl
aldehyde can react quickly in the presence of oxygen and a catalytic
amount of copper to provide highly stable benzimidazole with a high
yield at room temperature (rt).27,28 In this report, a new
radioiodination strategy using an aryl diamine and alkyl aldehyde
condensation reaction has been demonstrated. The condensation reactions
between aryl diamine and radioiodinated alkyl aldehyde have been tested.
The cRGD peptide and human serum albumin (HSA) protein were used as
the model substrates.22 The biodistribution
data for radioiodinated HSA have been acquired to confirm the in vivo stability against deiodination. Among the various
available radioiodine, 125I has been selected because of
its easy commercial availability and suitable half-life (59.4 days),
which allows repetitive experiments to optimize the radiolabeling
procedure.29

Results and Discussion
Radiosynthesis
of 125I-Labeled Aldehyde [125I] 5
The radiosynthesis
of 125I-labeled aldehyde [125I] 5 is shown in Scheme 3. An alkyl chain containing aldehyde has
been synthesized by considering its importance for the efficient production
of the corresponding benzimidazole. For the identification and characterization
of radioiodinated [125I]
5, nonradioactive analogue 4-iodo-N-(4-oxobutyl)benzamide 5 has been synthesized by the coupling of 4-aminobutyraldehyde
diethyl acetal and 4-iodobenzoic acid under basic conditions and then
subsequent reduction under acidic conditions in the next step (Scheme 2). Radioiodination
of 6 was accomplished using [125I]NaI and
chloramine-T as an oxidizing agent (Scheme 3). The radioiodination reaction was terminated
by adding aqueous sodium metabisulfite. After high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) purification of the crude product, [125I] 5 was obtained with a
high radiochemical yield (72 ± 6%, n = 5). The
specific activity was 45 GBq/μmol and chemical purity was more
than 99%. A HPLC chromatogram of the crude mixture clearly showed
the major product [125I]
5 at 22.6 min (Figure S16). Radiolabeling
reaction was performed by using varying amounts of radioactivity (100
μCi to 1 mCi), however, the radiochemical results were consistent.
The radioiodinated compound [125I] 5 was found to be stable in the refrigerator (4 °C)
for more than 6 months and did not undergo hydrolysis, unlike already
used active ester-based prosthetic groups (Bolton–Hunter-reagent).8 Compound [125I] 5 was found to be stable in different media, including
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), saline, and mouse serum at 37 °C
for more than 24 h, as determined using radio-HPLC (Figure S17).

Reagents

[125I]NaI, chloramine-T, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), rt,
10 min and (ii) Cu2+, pH 7.5, rt, air.

Radiosynthesis of Compound [125I] 7
Aldehyde diamine coupling reactions
were carried out using radioiodinated compound [125I] 5 and diamine group containing
compound 4. An aryl diamine ring supplemented with the
electron-withdrawing group (−OCH2−) has been
selected to accelerate the coupling reaction (Scheme 1). Before the radiosynthesis of the target
compound [125I] 7, a nonradioactive analogue 7 was synthesized for the
HPLC identification and characterization of [125I] 7. Compound 7 was synthesized
by stirring compounds 4 and 5 in the presence
of oxygen and a catalytic amount of copper sulfate at rt (Scheme 2). The radiolabeling
reaction was performed by mixing various concentrations of 5-(3,4-diaminophenoxy)-N-(2-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)ethyl)pentanamide 4 (5, 25, and 50 μM) with 100 μCi of [125I] 5 at rt. The reaction
was monitored at different time points by using radio-HPLC, and radiochemical
yields observed are summarized in Table 1. More than 99 and 91% of [125I] 7 were obtained using 50 and 25 μM of 4, respectively, within 30 min and at rt (entries 2 and 3).
In addition, more than 80% of [125I] 5 was converted into [125I] 7 using 5 μM of substrate 4 in 30 min (entry 4). The reaction was slow at 5 min although we
used 50 μM of precursor 4 (entry 1), however, a
high radiochemical yield was observed 30 min post incubation (entry
3). The radiochemical yields and reaction kinetics were found to be
comparable to many bioconjugate reactions given in the literature.28 These results encouraged us to label the model
protein using a diamine and aldehyde coupling reaction.

Radiosynthesis
of Compound [125I] 8
Radiolabeled cRGD peptides have
a high binding affinity and selectivity for αvβ3 receptors and are extensively used to detect metastatic diseases
and rapidly growing cancers in preclinical studies. Many radiolabeled
cRGD peptides have been developed for SPECT or PET-based studies of
tumor models.30 We also selected cRGD as
the model peptide to test the efficiency of our radiolabeling strategy.
Radiosynthesis of the titled compound [125I] 8 is shown in Scheme 4. The radiolabeling reaction was performed
by mixing the different concentrations of aryl diamine-installed cRGD 8 (5, 25, and 50 μM) with 100 μCi of [125I] 5 at rt in the presence
of a catalyst. The radioiodination reaction was monitored using radio-HPLC,
and the observed radiochemical yields are summarized in Table 1. More than 99% of [125I] 8 were obtained using
50 μM of 8 within 30 min and at rt (entry 5). In
addition, 93% and 69% of [125I] 8 were obtained for 25 and 5 μM of 8, respectively. The radiolabeling reaction was neat, and only one
radioiodinated product was observed in the radio-HPLC chromatogram.
In our previously reported cRGD peptide radioiodination using TCO
and radioiodinated tetrazine-based bioconjugation reaction, a mixture
of isomers was observed.22 These results
can support preclinical studies, however, they can impede with getting
an approval from regulatory authorities for clinical application of
the bioconjugtion reaction. In this regard, it is a clear advantage
for aryl diamine alkyl aldehyde coupling reaction to radiolabeled
small molecules with high radiochemical purity.

Radioiodination of HSA [125I] 9
To
determine the radiolabeling efficiency
of an aryl diamine alkyl aldehyde coupling reaction, [125I] 5 was treated with aryl
diamine containing HSA protein 9 (Scheme 5). The HSA protein not only serves as a drug-delivery
carrier but also enhances the blood circulation time of rapidly clearing
drugs.31−34 It is readily available against chemical modifications and can be
stable at different pH levels (4–9) and at high temperature
(60 °C for 10 h).35 For successful
noninvasive sentinel lymph node imaging, 68Ga, 99mTc, and 18F-labeled HSA have been synthesized and used.36−40 In this experiment, we used maleimide–cysteine-34 conjugation
instead of N-succinimidyl ester–lysine based
coupling on HSA because it offers a better diamine installed HSA protein
with minimum alteration of the protein structure and a very high purity
product. In our previous study, for the synthesis of TCO-modified
HSA, TCO succinimidyl ester was used, which caused changes in the
structure and biological activity of modified HSA.22 This is because lysine groups are abundant in the HSA protein,
and TCO succinimidyl ester group addition can go in an uncontrolled
fashion. The maleimide-cysteine reaction used in this study showed
clear advantage over previous results.

aryl diamine-functionalized HSA [125I] 9
Reagents and conditions:
(i)
PBS, rt, pH 7.5, 10 h and (ii) [125I] 5, Cu2+, air, rt.

For the chemical installation of the aryl diamine group
to the
HSA, a 4 molar excess amount of maleimide containing aryl diamine 4 was incubated with HSA in PBS of pH 7.5 at 25 °C for
10 h (Scheme 5). At
the end of the reaction, the mixture was passed through a PD-10 (size
exclusion) column to get chemically installed aryl diamine HSA. The
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
analysis confirmed the purity and characterization of the desired
product. The results showed that 1.3 aryl diamine groups were conjugated
with one HSA protein at rt (Figure S14).
To determine the efficiency of an alkyl aldehyde aryl diamine condensation
reaction, various concentrations of aryl diamine-installed HSA were
incubated with 100 μCi of 125I-labeled alkyl aldehyde [125I] 5 in the presence
of a catalytic amount of CuSO4. The radiochemical yields
were determined using radio thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and are
summarized in Table 2. The conversion yield was concentration-dependent and more than
a 94% radiochemical yield was obtained for 50 μM aryl diamine-modified
HSA 9 within 2 h (entry 3). Under the same reaction conditions,
89 and 67% radiochemical yields were obtained for 25 and 5 μM
of aryl diamine-modified HSA, respectively (entries 4 and 5). In the
control experiment, [125I] 5 was incubated with nonmodified pure HSA under the same
conditions, but no nonspecific interactions were observed (Figure S15). Next, we prepared [125I] 9 for a biodistribution
study through incubation of 50 μM aryl diamine-modified HSA 9 with 1.0 mCi of 125I-labeled alkyl-aldehyde [125I] 5 for 2 h in the
presence of a catalyst. The crude mixture was purified using a PD-10
desalting column to provide [125I] 9 with 90% isolated radiochemical yield and more
than 99% radiochemical purity. To compare the in vivo behavior, HSA
was also radioiodinated via a tyrosine ring using [125I]
NaI and chloramine-T as the oxidizing agent. 125I-HSA ([125I] 10) was synthesized
with an 83% radiochemical yield and more than 99% radiochemical purity
after purification through the PD-10 column.

Biodistribution of Radioiodinated
HSA
Biodistribution
studies were performed using [125I] 9 and ICR male mice. Each mouse was intravenously
injected with 1 μCi of a radiolabeled product, and the biodistribution
data were acquired at 0.5, 3, 6, 24, and 36 h post injection. A large
amount of radioactivity (24.07 ± 1.28% ID/g) was found in the
blood pool during the initial time point; the level of activity was
quite high even after 24 h (8.32 ± 0.72% ID/g) and 36 h (6.73
± 0.48% ID/g) post injection (Figure 1). These observations suggest that [125I] 9 has a long blood
circulation time, which can be used to increase the blood half-life
of the fast clearing drugs after conjugation with [125I] 9.41 The radioactivity uptake in other organs including spleen, liver,
small intestine, large intestine, lungs, heart, and stomach was significantly
high at the initial time point but decreased with the passage of time.
Slightly high kidney uptake suggests renal clearance of the labeled
compound via urine. The accumulation of radioactivity in the thyroid,
which normally indicates in vivo deiodination, was 5.20 ± 1.61%
ID/g and 4.86 ± 1.01% ID/g at 24 and 36 h post iv injection,
respectively. We performed the biodistribution study of directly radioiodinated
HSA ([125I] 10),
and the data are summarized in Table S1. The accumulation of radioactivity from [125I] 10 in the thyroid was normal during
the first time point but increased with the passage of time. The thyroid
uptake was found to be 255.1 ± 66.21% ID/g and 395.2 ± 59.98%
ID/g at 24 and 36 h post iv injection, respectively. These results
suggest the high instability of radioiodine on the tyrosine ring in vivo. Moreover, the [125I] 5 structure is proved to be stable and altogether
different from iodotyrosine, which can undergo easy deiodination in vivo. The overall isolated radiochemical yield and in vivo stability of alkyl aldehyde aryl diamine condensation
reaction is far better as compared with the direct radioiodination
of tyrosine using some harsh oxidizing agents such as chloramine-T,
which can damage the protein and decrease the bioactivity of the radiolabeled
protein. The aryl diamine and alkyl aldehyde condensation reaction
can be used for the radioiodination of many other small and large
bioactive molecules. Moreover, the in vitro and in vivo stabilities of precursor [125I] 5 are quite high and it is normally
unreacted toward all functional groups in biologically active proteins.

Conclusions
In the present study,
we demonstrated an efficient and novel 125I-labeling strategy
for biologically active molecules (proteins
and peptides) by using an alkyl aldehyde and aryl diamine condensation
reaction. The rapid condensation reaction using [125I] 5 was applied on HSA and cRGD
peptide, which provided 125I-labeled HSA ([125I] 9) and cRGD peptide ([125I] 8) in an excellent
radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity. The biodistribution
study suggested that 125I-labeled HSA ([125I] 9) is highly stable against in vivo deiodination and can be used for the SPECT imaging
study. Moreover, the present methodology is potent; it proceeds in
aqueous medium under ambient conditions, and the coupling reaction
has excellent conversion, favorable reaction kinetics, and excellent
biocompatibility, as compared with previously reported ligation. The
investigation of the novel alkyl aldehyde and aryl diamine condensation
reaction by using different therapeutic and diagnostic radioisotopes
as well as engineered proteins such as repebody protein is in progress.

Biodistribution of Radioiodinated
HSA [125I] 9
For a biodistribution
study, 25 male ICR mice (6 weeks old) were purchased from Orientbio
Co., Ltd (Jeonbuk, Korea Republic). The ICR mice were divided into
five groups so that each group contained five animals. Each mouse
was injected with an aqueous solution of [125I] 9 or [125I] 10 (100 μL, 1 μCi) through the
tail vein. After 0.5, 3, 6, 24, and 36 h post injection, a group of
mice were sacrificed under isoflurane dose; the organs of interest
(thyroid, lungs, stomach, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, large intestines,
and small intestine) and blood were collected. The collected blood
and organs were weighed and the accumulated radioactivity was determined
using a 1480 wizard 3, (PerkinElmer, USA) gamma counter. The final
biodistribution data were reported in terms of the percentage injected
dose per gram of organ or blood (% ID/g). All animal experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee
and performed according to the guidelines prescribed by the committee.
