Thyroid
hormones are important regulatory hormones, acting on nearly
every cell in the body. The two main thyroid hormones are l-thyroxine (tetraiodo-l-thyronine, T4) and 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), which are produced in the thyroid
gland and secreted into the blood stream. Other important thyroid
hormone metabolites are 3,3′-diiodo-l-thyronine (T2) and l-thyronine (T0), which may show
increased levels in circulation due to dietary iodine deficiency or
other medical disorders. Owing to their central role in cellular functions,
sensitive and specific detection methods for thyroid hormones are
needed. In this work, native mass spectrometry (MS) was used to quantitate
thyroid hormone binding to the anti-T4 antibody Fab fragment.
First, the binding affinity for T2 was determined via direct
ligand titration experiments. Then, the affinities for the other ligands
were determined by competition experiments using T2 as
the “low-affinity” reference ligand. The highest affinity
was measured for T3, followed by T4, T2, and T0 (Kd = 29, 3.4, and
260 nM and 130 μM, respectively). Thus, it is evident that the
number and positions of the iodine substituents within the thyronine
rings are important for the ligand binding affinity of anti-T4 Fab. Surprisingly, structurally related tetrahalogen bisphenols
were also able to bind to anti-T4 Fab with nanomolar affinities.

Introduction
Thyroid hormones (THs)
play an important role in the regulation
of metabolism, especially growth and development.1 THs exert their effects by binding to thyroid hormone receptors
(THRs), which are members of a nuclear hormone receptor family. THRs
exist in three major isoforms, THRα1, THRβ1, and THRβ2.2

Thyroid hormones are derivatives of l-tyrosine and contain
a variable amount of iodine substituents in their structures (Figure 1). They are produced
in the thyroid gland, which secretes these hormones into the blood
stream. The most abundant TH in the blood is l-thyroxine
(tetraiodo-l-thyronine, T4), which contains four
iodine substituents in the ring positions 3, 5, 3′, and 5′.
In the cells, T4 is converted to a more potent 3,3′,5′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) by deiodinases. The binding affinity
of T3 to THRα1 is significantly stronger (Kd = 0.06 nM) as compared to T4 (Kd = 2 nM).3

Figure 1 Chemical structures
of thyroid hormones and bisphenols used in
this study.

In serum, THs exist either free
or bound to several different proteins,
such as thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin, albumin, and apolipoproteins.
Concentrations of the protein-bound THs are in the nanomolar level,
while free THs are present in picomolar concentrations.4 The concentration of free T4 in the
blood stream is higher than that of T3 (typically around
19 and 4 pM).3

There are also a number
of other compounds that structurally resemble
T4 and T3. These include thyroid hormone metabolites,
3,3′,5′-triiodo-l-thyronine (so-called reverse
T3), 3,3′-diiodo-l-thyronine (T2), and l-thyronine (T0), as well as other compounds
such as different organohalogen compounds. One class of such compounds
is bisphenols, which are widely used as starting materials in polycarbonate
and epoxy resin synthesis. Different bisphenols have also potential
to bind different nuclear hormone receptors and may affect a variety
of physiological functions.5,6 Thus, thyroid hormones,
their metabolites, and other structurally related compounds (e.g.,
halogenated bisphenols) form a group of molecules, which may bind
to the same receptor protein(s) with different affinities and specificities.
Sensitive and specific detection methods for these molecules are therefore
needed.

Two widely used, label-free techniques for biomolecular
interaction
analysis are surface plasmon resonance (SPR)7 and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).8 In SPR, the other binding partner (usually ligand) is covalently
immobilized onto a sensor surface and the binding of the other analyte
(protein) is then measured. SPR directly provides association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants for the interaction, which can be used
to calculate dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding. In ITC, the biomolecular interaction is quantified
by measuring the heat (enthalpy) associated with the binding, which
is used to determine Kd as well as other
thermodynamic parameters. Therefore, ITC can be considered a true
label-free technique. However, ITC suffers from high sample consumption,
lengthy analysis times, and low sensitivity, which limits the accessible Kd range. SPR is more sensitive and faster than
ITC and also directly provides kinetic information, but the method
is not truly label free as one binding partner is immobilized, which
may alter binding thermodynamics. Furthermore, neither SPR nor ITC
directly provides binding stoichiometry, and therefore, the obtained
values depend on the model used for the data fitting.9

An alternative method to study ligand binding to
proteins is native
mass spectrometry (MS).10 In native MS,
proteins are measured in their folded, biologically active states.
Native MS does not require any labeling or immobilization of the binding
partners, which could have adverse effects on the binding. Furthermore,
native MS is more sensitive and faster as compared to many other techniques
and can also be used to screen more than one ligand at the time. Unlike
any other technique, native MS directly provides the binding stoichiometry
since separate signals for the free and bound protein forms are obtained.
In addition, measurements can be carried out with very small amounts
of purified protein materials and even with endogenous protein samples.9,11

In this work, native MS was used to quantitate thyroid hormone
binding to the anti-thyroxine antibody Fab fragment (anti-T4 Fab). To gain insight into the binding specificity of anti-T4 Fab, we chose T4, T3, T2, and T0 among different thyroid hormones for this study.
In addition, binding of structurally related tetrahalogen bisphenols
(tetraiodobisphenol-A, TIB; tetrabromobisphenol-A, TBB; tetrachlorobisphenol-A,
TCB) was also characterized (Figure 1). The work was carried out in three steps: (1) initial
screening of the ligands to find approximate binding affinities and
to select a “low-affinity” reference ligand, (2) direct
titration of a reference ligand to determine its accurate Kd value, and (3) ligand competition experiments
with the other ligands to determine their respective Kd values. This workflow provided accurate Kd values for all the ligands studied, ranging from low
nanomolar to high micromolar levels. The results well demonstrate
the performance of native MS in the accurate analysis of ligand binding
thermodynamics (at high- and low-affinity regimes) as well as high
sensitivity of the technique (i.e., only ∼0.5 μg of protein
consumed per a single native MS experiment).

Results and Discussion
MS Analysis
of Anti-T4 Fab Fragment
Prior
to the ligand binding experiments, the desalted anti-T4 Fab fragment was analyzed in both denaturing and native solution
conditions (Figure 2). In the denaturing conditions, the electrospray ionization Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrum of anti-T4 Fab (Figure 2A) exhibited a broad charge state distribution (CSD) centered at
high charge states (20+ to 42+ at m/z 1200–2200), consistent with the fully denatured (unfolded)
protein in these conditions. The most abundant isotopic mass, obtained
from the deconvoluted mass spectrum (see inset in Figure 2A), was determined to be 48703.897
Da, which differs from the calculated mass (48643.489 Da) by 60.41
Da. The reason for this deviation is not known but was not further
investigated since the protein was able to bind its target ligands
(this study). In contrast, the mass spectrum measured in the native
solution conditions (Figure 2B) displayed a narrow charge state distribution centered at
low charge states (16+ to 13+ at m/z 3000–3500), indicating that anti-T4 Fab remained
fully folded in these conditions.12 Therefore,
20 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution (pH 6.9) was selected as the
solvent for the further ligand binding experiments. The direct infusion
ESI FT-ICR experiments permitted native MS measurements of anti-T4 Fab even at 10 nM protein concentration (data not shown).
However, for the further experiments, the protein concentration was
fixed to 0.1 μM to obtain sufficiently high signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratios for more accurate binding constant determinations.

acetate (pH 6.8) (native conditions). In (A), the inset shows the
deconvoluted mass spectrum with the peak representing the most abundant
isotopic mass marked with an arrow.

Ligand Screening
The initial ligand screening experiments
were performed to determine the approximate binding affinities of
the ligands toward anti-T4 Fab. The mass spectra indicated
only 1:1 binding for the five ligands (T4, T3, T2, TIB, and TBB), at different ligand concentrations,
suggesting that the ligand binding was specific (Figures S1–S7). The only exceptions were T0 and TCB for which also the binding of the second ligand at the highest
ligand concentrations was observed. This most likely represents nonspecific
binding to the other than the primary binding site. Based on the initial
ligand screening, T4 and T3 were recognized
as the high-affinity ligands, having low nanomolar binding affinities.
In addition, T2 showed clearly a weaker binding affinity,
being in the submicrometer range. The remaining ligands (T0, TIB, TBB, and TCB) showed submicromolar to micromolar affinity
range. To measure the Kd values, direct
ligand titration experiments for the high-affinity ligands T4 and T3 were not possible at 0.1 μM protein concentration
because the free ligand concentration would have been extremely low
at any substoichiometric ligand concentration, making it difficult
to obtain accurate Kd values. Therefore,
we decided to first perform direct ligand titration experiments with
the “low-affinity” ligand (T2) against anti-T4 Fab to obtain its accurate Kd value. Then, this ligand would be used as a reference ligand to
find Kd values for the other (low or high
affinity) ligands through competitive ligand binding experiments.

Determination of Kd for T2–Anti-T4 Fab Complex by Using
a Direct Ligand Titration
Based on the initial screening,
the T2 ligand was selected
as the “low-affinity” reference ligand. For the titration,
10 different ligand concentrations were used, ranging from 0.005 to
2 μM, at a fixed Fab concentration of 0.1 μM. The native
ESI FT-ICR mass spectra showed only the peaks corresponding to the
free Fab and the Fab–ligand complex, implying high binding
specificity (Figure 3A). From the ESI-MS spectra, we calculated the free and bound protein
concentrations using the peak intensities and deduced the free ligand
concentrations.13 The MS titration plot
for T2 binding is presented in Figure 3B. The curve fitting yielded a Kd value for T2 of (2.63 ± 0.16) ×
10–7 M. We then used this value to determine the
dissociation constants for the other ligands by using ligand competition
experiments, having at least two different ligand concentrations.

value from the five replicate samples. The solid red line represents
the best fit to the specific one-site binding model.

Determination of Kd Values for the
Other Ligand–Fab Complexes by Using Ligand Competition Experiments
The T2 ligand was used as a “low-affinity”
reference ligand (Lref) to determine Kd values of the other (high and low affinity) ligands.
The representative mass spectra of the ligand competition experiments
are presented in Figure 4 (for the other ligands, see Figure S8). The determined Kd values of the thyroid
hormones and bisphenols are reported in Table 1. Among the thyroid hormones, T3 had the highest affinity, followed by T4, T2, and T0. Adamczyk and co-workers studied thyroid hormone
binding to anti-T4 Fab earlier by using SPR.14,15 They found that T4 had the highest affinity (approximately
10 times higher than that of T3) and that T2 did not show any binding, at least within the Kd range accessible by the SPR technique. The differences
in the ligand affinities might well be due to the structural differences
between antibodies, which manifest in different specificities. Also,
solubilities of ligands and differences in the experimental setup
may affect results. In SPR, one component is immobilized, whereas
in ESI-MS, both components are in solution.8 Only T0 had clearly a weaker binding affinity (approximately
five orders of magnitude lower than that of T3), which
suggests that the iodine substituents have a decisive role for the
ligand recognition of the anti-T4 Fab fragment. Interestingly,
bisphenols also had relatively high binding affinities toward the
Fab fragment with the affinities lowering as the halogen size gets
smaller (i.e., I > Br > Cl). It is therefore evident that anti-T4 Fab is able to accept many different ligands in its binding
site (i.e., promiscuous ligand binding). These results are in line
with some previous studies.6

Additionally, measurements
were performed to investigate whether
the dissociation constants were independent on the used ligand concentrations.
This self-validation experiment was done by using two different concentrations
for T4/T2, T3/T2, and
T0/T2 ligand pairs (i.e., 0.14/0.5, 0.14/0.5,
and 15/0.05 μM, respectively). The determined Kd values were very similar to those determined earlier; Kd for T4 was (2.39 ± 0.37) ×
10–8 M, Kd for T3 was (3.80 ± 0.14) × 10–9 M, and Kd for T0 was (1.74 ± 0.18) ×
10–4 M. Thus, it is evident that the chosen ligand
concentrations were optimal for ligand competition experiments and
did not markedly affect the obtained Kd values.

Conclusions
The binding affinities of selected thyroid
hormones and related
halogenated bisphenols to the anti-T4 antibody Fab fragment
were successfully determined by using a native MS-based method. The
results clearly show that the iodine atoms in thyroid hormones play
a major role in the ligand binding affinity and selectivity. The ligand
without iodine substituents (T0) had approximately five
orders of magnitude lower binding affinity as compared to the ligand
with the highest affinity (T3). The results suggest that
the ligand with three iodine atoms (T3) has even a higher
affinity as compared to the ligand with four iodine atoms (T4). The reason for this is not evident without further structural
studies, but it can be noted that T3 also binds with higher
affinity to the thyroid hormone receptor as compared to T4.3 On the other hand, T4 has
been reported to have a higher affinity to the plasma membrane receptor
on integrin αυβ3, which initiates nongenomic actions.16,17 It is also remarkable that two tetrahalogen bisphenols, TIB and
TBB, also show nanomolar binding affinities to anti-T4 Fab,
which point out to their potential to bind to other thyroid hormone
receptors, which may result in endocrine disrupting activities.5 As stressed by Jecklin et al, the use of several
independent methods is advantageous in determining binding affinities
of ligands to proteins.8,9 The
current results show that native MS serves as an effective, independent
method to accurately measure dissociation constants for protein–ligand
complexes within a large dynamic range (from low nanomolar to millimolar
affinity levels) and has some benefits over more conventional techniques,
such as a high dynamic range, high sensitivity, and possibility to
screen several ligands at the same time, as well as a direct stoichiometrical
information directly provided. Native MS could also serve as a promising
tool to characterize specificity of closely related ligands such as
thyroid hormones to further to clarify cellular events on which thyroid
hormone regulation would be a good example.17

Experimental Section
Materials
The Fab fragment antibody
library from a
multi-immunized mouse was constructed and displayed to a surface of
bacterial phages as described by Tullila and Nevanen.18 Multi-immunization included thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine (T3). The anti-T4 Fab repertoire
was enriched utilizing streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (SpeedBeads;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Santa Clara, CA) functionalized with a biotinylated
T4-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and a KingFisher magnetic
particle processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a method described
by Tullila and Nevanen.18 After four rounds
of selection, a total of 384 single colonies were cultivated and induced
for antibody production in 96-well plates. The T4 binding
affinity was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
A robotic station (Beckman Coulter) was employed to ELISA screening
assays as described by Arola et al.19 The
antibody clone giving the highest intensities against T4- and T3-HSA-coated wells in ELISA was chosen for production
and purification.

The anti-T4 Fab-fragment was produced
in Escherichia coli and purified by
using an immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by a protein
G affinity chromatography. The produced protein was analyzed by a
nonreducing SDS-PAGE using GelCode staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and showed a high level of purity. All thyroid hormones (T4, T3, T2, and T0), tetrahalogen
bisphenols (TIB, TBB, and TCB), and ultrapure ammonium acetate (NH4OAc; 99.999%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis,
MO). Prior to the mass measurements, the protein sample was concentrated
by using a 5 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter device (Vivaspin 2; GE Healthcare,
Gillingham, U.K.) using ultracentrifugation at 15,000 rpm (Eppendorf
5804 R) at 4 °C. The concentrated protein sample was further
desalted with a Sephadex G-25 M (PD-10; GE Healthcare) column, using
aqueous ammonium acetate (20 mM; pH 6.8) as an eluent. The protein
stock solution concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad DC
protein assay20,21 with bovine serum albumin as
the standard, and the absorbance of the protein sample was determined
at 280 nm with a UV spectrophotometer (VWR Spectrophotometer UV-1600PC).
All the ligands were accurately weighed and dissolved in 4 M NH4OH/ethanol (1:1, v/v) to a concentration of 1 mM. All the
solvents (HPLC grade) were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The
protein and ligand solutions were stored at −20 °C prior
to use. The structures of the ligands are shown in Figure 1.

Mass Spectrometry
All mass spectrometric experiments
were performed by using a 12-T Bruker solariX XR Fourier transform
ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Apollo-II).
Mass spectra were obtained in a positive ion mode, and the samples
were directly infused to the ion source at a flow rate of 2 μL
min–1. Dry nitrogen was used as nebulizing (4.0
L min–1) and drying (80 °C, 1.0 bar) gas. The
ions were accumulated in the hexapole ion trap for 3.5 s and then
transferred to the dynamically harmonized ICR cell (Paracell) for
trapping, excitation, and detection. The time of flight was set to
3.5 ms. All other instrumental parameters were carefully adjusted
to preserve noncovalent interactions in the gas phase. One hundred
1024 kWord time-domain transients were summed for each spectrum and
zero-filled once prior to fast Fourier transform (FFT) and magnitude
calculation. The mass spectra were externally calibrated by the ESI
Tuning mix (part no. G2431A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
The mass spectra were acquired from m/z 1500 to 5000. The data acquisition was attained by ftmsControl 2.1
software and further processed and analyzed by DataAnalysis 4.2 SR1
software. All native MS experiments were performed in 20 mM aqueous
ammonium acetate (pH 6.9) solution. For denaturing MS experiments,
a mixture of CH3CN/H2O/CH3COOH (49.5:49.5:1,
v/v; pH 3.2) was used as a solvent instead.

Ligand Affinity Determination
Initial
Screening to Determine Approximate Binding Affinities
First,
the approximate binding affinities of thyroid hormones and
tetrahalogen bisphenols to anti-T4 Fab were determined
via initial screening experiments (Figures S1–S7). Since the binding affinities were expected to be in the nanomolar
range,14,15 the protein concentration was fixed to 0.1
μM and each ligand was added at four to six different concentrations
until the ligand saturation was observed (except in the case of TCB,
for which the saturative binding was not observed even at a molar
ligand excess of 200).

Direct Ligand Titration
A direct
ligand titration9,22,23 was used to determine the binding
constant for the “low-affinity” reference ligand. Among
the thyroid hormones tested, 3,3′-diiodo-l-thyronine
(T2) was selected as the reference ligand owing to its Kd value, fitting perfectly to a lowest practical
protein concentration of 0.1 μM (see Results
and Discussion section for details). Briefly, the concentration
of anti-T4 Fab was kept constant, while T2 concentration
was varied (0.005–2.0 μM), spanning approximately the Kd value estimated through initial screening
experiments. The fractional saturation (Y) of the
protein was calculated from the intensity ratio of the protein–ligand
complex (PL) and free protein (P) for every single ligand (L) concentration
(intensities averaged over different charge states), and the data
were fitted into the specific, single-site binding model24 1  where Bmax is
the number of binding sites (maximum occupancy) and
[L] is the free ligand concentration. Five replicate samples were
prepared and measured for each T2 concentration. The curve
fittings were performed using OriginPro 15.0 software (Origin Lab,
Northampton, MA, USA).

Ligand Competition Experiments
To
determine the binding
affinities for the other ligands, ligand competition experiments were
performed.25,26 Briefly, T2 was used
as the “low-affinity” reference ligand, whose accurate Kd value was determined earlier by the direct
ligand titration. The two ligands, competing for the same binding
site in anti-T4 Fab, were mixed at the appropriate concentrations
(determined earlier by initial screening experiments) with the protein
at a fixed concentration of 0.1 μM. Ten replicates were measured
for each ligand pair from three different samples. The final values
have been reported as the mean value ± one standard deviation.

A mathematical model to calculate Kd values from the competition experiments was as follows: For L and
Lref, competing for a single binding site in P, the two equilibrium reactions are    where P is the receptor protein, L is the
ligand, and Lref is the “low-affinity” reference
ligand. Briefly, the intensity ratio (R) of the total
abundance of the ligand-bound protein (PL) and free protein (P) was
calculated for each spectrum. The affinity measurement for the “low-affinity”
ligand (Lref) was performed by a direct titration method.
The individual Kd values for L and Lref are derived as 2   3  where the brackets represent
equilibrium concentrations of L, Lref, P, PL, and PLref. The mass balance equations at equilibrium are 4   5   6  where [P]total,
[L]total, and [Lref]total are the
total protein, ligand, and reference ligand concentrations, respectively.

At equilibrium, [P] is the same for both ligands, and thus, eqs. 4 and 5 were simplified to 7  

The ESI-MS spectrum directly
provides normalized intensities (“concentration coefficients”) i(P), i(PL), and i(PLref), such that their sum equals 1, which can then be used
to calculate equilibrium concentrations by eqs 8, 9, and 10: 8   9   10  These calculations are valid
if one assumes that the ionization and ion transmission efficiencies
for P, PL, and PLref are the same (they are if mL ≈ mLref ≪ mP, which is true in this case),
and there is no complex dissociation upon ionization/desolvation stages
(i.e., careful adjustments of instrumental parameters). The intensities
should be calculated as integrated sums of different charge states
to avoid any bias resulting from different CSDs between the free and
bound proteins. The free ligand concentrations, [L] and [Lref], can be obtained from eqs 5 and 6. The equilibrium concentrations
[L], [Lref], [PL], and [PLref] as well as the
predetermined/known Kd(Lref) can be inserted into eq 7 to calculate Kd(L).
