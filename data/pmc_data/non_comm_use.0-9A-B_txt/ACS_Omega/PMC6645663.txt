We describe herein a fluorescence-based
assay to characterize and
report on nucleophilic addition to carbonyl moieties and highlight
the advantages a fluorescence-based assay and multiplex analysis can
offer. The assay relies on the fluorogenic properties of meso-formyl boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes that become emissive following
nucleophilic addition. A reactivity palette is assembled based on
the increasing electrophilic character of five meso-formyl BODIPY compounds tested. We show that increasing rates of
emission enhancement correlate with the decreasing electrophilic character
of BODIPY dyes in the presence of an acid catalyst and a nucleophile.
These results are consistent with the rate-limiting step involving
activation of the electrophile. Increasing product formation is shown
to correlate with the increasing electrophilic character of the BODIPY
dyes, as expected based on thermodynamics. In addition to providing
rates of reaction, analysis of the fluorescence parameters for the
reaction mixtures, including emission quantum yields and fluorescence
lifetimes, enables us to determine the extent of reactant conversion
at equilibrium (in our case the estimated yield of a transient species)
and the presence of different products, without the need for isolation.
We anticipate that our reactivity palette approach, combined with
the in-depth fluorescence analysis discussed herein, will provide
guidelines toward developing fluorogenic assays of reactivity offering
multiplex information, beyond fluorescence intensity.

Introduction
A significant effort
has been devoted over the past decade toward
developing fluorogenic probes for reaction screening.1−6 A number of fluorescence-based assays have been reported to monitor
and study bond formation in a diverse set of reactions including aldol
reactions,7−9 Mannich-type reactions,10 Michael additions,11−13 and palladium-catalyzed reactions.14−16 These assays,
using fluorescence intensity as a marker, provide a rapid, in situ
screening platform that is of simple application and requires minimum
equipment investment.

We serendipitously uncovered that meso-formyl
boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are nonemissive, yet their emission
is readily restored following the reaction with methanol.17,18 These dyes, we reasoned, would serve as uniquely sensitive probes
of nucleophilic attack, given that their emission is undetectable
before the reaction (i.e., their emission quantum yield is nominally
0) but readily observable to the naked eye upon methanol addition.18 Given the ubiquitous nature of nucleophilic
addition reactions in biology19−22 and in synthesis, the availability of a series of
fluorogenic electrophiles23 would provide
a simple, suitable tool to study nucleophile and aldehyde reactivity.

Here, we demonstrate that a reactivity palette may be assembled
for nucleophilic addition screening composed of electrophilic fluorogenic meso-formyl BODIPY dyes of increasing reactivity. We show
that the rates of emission enhancement and the emission intensity
measured for meso-formyl BODIPY dyes upon hemiacetal
and/or acetal formation in the presence of various small alcohols,
water, and ethanedithiol (see Scheme 1) provide suitable markers to elaborate a reactivity
scale and to determine the extent of reaction, respectively. We also
highlight the valuable information a fluorescence assay may offer,
with relative simplicity, beyond monitoring the fluorescence intensity
alone. Specifically, we show the importance of monitoring the photophysical
parameters of the reaction mixtures, including the emission quantum
yield and the fluorescence lifetime, and of investigating the photophysical
properties of the reaction products. Information on reaction yields,
number of products, and type of products formed, we show, may be gained
upon inspecting these various photophysical properties.

BODIPY and an Alcohol (ROH)
We propose that our reactivity palette approach combined
with the
in-depth fluorescence analysis developed herein will be of general
applicability toward developing additional fluorogenic assays (including
high throughput) on reactivity.

Results and Discussion
Rationale
Toward implementing a reactivity scale, we
conceived a fluorogenic reactivity palette consisting of five electrophilic,
nonemissive, meso-formyl BODIPY dyes (see compounds 1–5, Figure 1).18 Nucleophilic addition and
concomitant disruption of the formyl moiety deactivate an otherwise
highly efficient nonradiative decay pathway for the excited state,17,18 rendering the probes emissive (Figure 2A). meso-Formyl BODIPY dyes
thus provide highly sensitive substrates toward developing a fluorogenic
palette.

work. The numbering of the BODIPY core is shown in green.

the error associated with performing a linear fit on the initial increase

the trajectories displayed in panel (D) with eq 2 and p-TsOH concentration.
Error bars were obtained from the error of the fitting with eq 2. (F) Equilibrium of meso-formyl BODIPY in the presence of an alcohol and an
acid catalyst.

To tune the electrophilic
character of BODIPY dyes, substitution
of the BODIPY core was performed with either electron-rich or electron-withdrawing
groups at positions C2 and C6 of the dye. From a frontier molecular
orbital (FMO) perspective, the reaction of a formyl group with a nucleophile
involves orbital mixing between the highest occupied molecular orbital
of the nucleophile and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
of the formyl group. Substitution of BODIPY dyes with electron-rich
groups, destabilizing the LUMO, renders the formyl moiety less electrophilic.
In turn, substitution by electron-withdrawing groups, for example,
either chlorine atoms or nitriles, and concomitant lowering of the
LUMO render the formyl group more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

Reactivity
The reactivity of compounds 1–5 was tested in acetonitrile upon the addition of methanol where either
a hemiacetal or acetal may form. Steady-state emission experiments
were conducted where fluorescence intensity enhancement immediately
following the addition of the nucleophile was monitored. Although
a trend in reactivity was apparent from results with compounds 1–5, we also noticed large variations in reruns of
the experiments, possibly the result of traces of water affecting
the ensuing kinetics of reaction. This observation prompted us to
explore the addition of an acid catalyst in a controlled fashion working
initially with compound 3. We chose p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) as an organic acid
catalyst, as it is commonly used in the preparation of acetals.24−26 Reproducible results with p-TsOH enabled us to
learn the equilibrium position and to obtain initial rates of reaction
under a range of conditions.

Consistent with the reversible
nature of the methanol addition (see Scheme 1), reaction of increasing amounts of methanol
at constant concentrations of compound 3 and in the presence
of p-TsOH as a catalyst resulted in increased intensities
at t = ∞, that is, once the reaction has reached
equilibrium (see Figure 2A). Under the assumption that conversion of meso-formyl BODIPY is small (confirmed by the apparent fluorescence quantum
yield experiments, vide infra) and working with a large excess of
nucleophile, one may then obtain a linear correlation between the
concentration of methanol added and the intensity at t = ∞ (Figure 2B). Under the above working conditions, both the electrophile initial
concentration, [E]0, and the nucleophile concentrations
used, [Nu]0, remain fairly constant upon reaction. One
may then show that the electrophile–nucleophile adduct concentration
[Nu–E], and thus the emission intensity, is proportional to
the initial concentration of the reactants used (see eq 1). 1  

In support of a pseudo-first-order
reaction mechanism in the presence
of excess nucleophile, the fluorescence intensity enhancement versus
time curves followed an exponential behavior. Fitting the fluorescence
intensity trajectories with an exponential growth curve according
to kinetic eq 2 next
enabled us to obtain values for the pseudo-first-order rate constant kapp, where I∞ is the fluorescence intensity at t = ∞ once
the reaction has reached equilibrium and I0 is the fluorescence intensity at t = 0. To our
initial surprise, while the initial rate of enhancement increased
linearly with increasing methanol concentration, at a large excess
of nucleophile, the reaction order changed and approached zero order
on nucleophile concentration, as observed from the plateau in the
plot of initial rate versus methanol concentration (see Figure 2C). 2  

To understand the mechanism of the nucleophilic addition to compound 3, we next subjected 3 to increasing concentrations
of p-TsOH in the presence of large excess of nucleophile,
1.09 M methanol, where the reaction approaches zeroth order in methanol
(see Figure 2D). A
linear correlation was observed between the concentration of p-TsOH and the apparent rate constant (Figure 2E). The linearity suggests
the formation of a catalyst-activated aldehyde (protonation of the meso-formyl BODIPY) as the rate-determining step and thus
a general acid catalysis mechanism (see Figure 2F).

To test the reactivity of our palette,
we monitored the rates of
intensity enhancement for compounds 1–5 in acetonitrile
in the presence of 1.09 M methanol and 0.333 mM p-TsOH (see Figure 3A). A linear free-energy relationship (LFER) analysis was conducted
utilizing the natural logarithm of the ratio of measured apparent
rate constant values (obtained according to eq 2, relative to compound 1) and
the difference in oxidation potentials for compounds 1–5 (see Figure 3B).27

Figure 3 (A) Intensity–time trajectories following the reaction
of
compounds 1–5 with 1.09 M methanol
in acetonitrile supplemented with 0.333 mM of p-TsOH
at 21 °C. Dye concentrations were prepared such that their respective
absorbance was 0.1 at the excitation wavelength used (i.e., 16, 20,
4.5, 16, and 3 μM for dyes 1–5, respectively)
(B) LFER correlation (slope = −5.2 and intercept = 0.1) between
the ratio of apparent rate constants (kapp) and the difference in oxidation potentials (to compound 1) in acetonitrile for BODIPY dyes 1–5 vs ferrocene
previously obtained by us.18 Where reversible
oxidation potentials were not available (i.e., compounds 3–5), anodic peak potentials were used. Compound 1kapp and oxidation potentials were used as a
reference. (C) LFER correlation (slope = 8 and intercept = 0.4) between
the calculated relative yield (vide infra) and the difference in reversible
reduction potentials in acetonitrile for dyes 1–5 (relative to compound 1) measured vs ferrocene previously
obtained by us.18 Compound 1 yield and reduction potentials were used as a reference.

Consistent with a rate-limiting step involving
activation via protonation
of meso-formyl BODIPY, we retrieved a negative slope
for the LFER correlation. Electron-rich groups on the BODIPY core
stabilize the activated complex, whereas the larger electronic density
in the BODIPY core increases the basicity and stabilizes the protonated meso-formyl BODIPY dye. An energy increasing by ca. 0.5
eV (∼48 kJ/mol) for the oxidation potential of BODIPY dyes
previously obtained by us18 in moving from
electron-releasing ethyl groups (compound 1) to an electron-withdrawing
nitrile group (compound 5) resulted in a drop by ca.
1 order of magnitude at 21 °C for rate constants. The rate enhancement
observed with decreasing oxidation potential is smaller than 8 orders
of magnitude expected at room temperature based on energy stabilization
alone. This indicates that the meso-formyl moiety,
which is uncoupled from the BODIPY core as it is 90° from the
BODIPY plane,17 is only moderately affected
by the substitution of the BODIPY core.

To test the equilibrium
position, we next compared the calculated
relative yield of the emissive product (vide infra) obtained for compounds 1–5, following the reaction with methanol. In comparing
the percent yield, we assumed that the radiative decay constant (krad) for each of the hemiacetal products formed
with compounds 1–5 was similar as is generally
the case for BODIPY dyes and is the case for meso-hydroxymethyl BODIPY dyes obtained, following the reduction of the
formyl moiety.18

A new LFER with
a positive slope was obtained when correlating
the natural logarithm of the ratio of the yield of the emissive product
(relative to compound 1) for dyes 1–5 in the presence of 1.09 M methanol and p-TsOH versus
the difference in reduction potentials (relative to compound 1) (LUMO energy values) (see Figure 3C). This LFER indicates that BODIPY cores
bearing electron-withdrawing groups favor product formation. The results
are consistent with FMO considerations, predicting the equilibrium
position to be displaced toward products in the increasing order 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5. A 10-fold increase in the product formation
was recorded upon stabilizing the LUMO by ca. 0.3 eV (29 kJ/mol) at
21 °C.

We next tested the effect of nucleophiles on the
rate of addition
to our formyl dyes by monitoring compound 3 in the presence
of various small alcohols, water, and ethanedithiol (Figure 4). The formation of nonemissive meso-imines upon the reaction of compounds 1–5 with amines precluded testing with this nucleophile substrate.17 Furthermore, amines are known to be fluorescence
quenchers of BODIPY dyes.28 All alcohols
tested reacted at comparable rates (kapp ≈ 0.003 s–1) and reached comparable fluorescence
intensities (∼50 000 counts/s). This is not surprising
given the general acid catalysis mechanism proposed (vide supra).
We did observe however a ca. −10-fold rate increase upon the
use of water as a nucleophile which may be partly due to lowering
of the pKa of p-TsOH
in the presence of water versus acetonitrile.29,30 The hydrate formation led to a very small emission enhancement,
indicating that it is not a stable compound.

Figure 4 (A) Intensity–time
trajectories following the reaction of
4.5 μM of compound 3 and 1.09 M methanol (MeOH),
ethanol (EtOH), butanol (BuOH), ethylene glycol (EtyGly), water (H2O), and ethanedithiol (EtSH2) at 21 °C in
acetonitrile supplemented with 0.333 mM of p-TsOH.
(B) Apparent rate constants for various nucleophiles tested were obtained
from fitting the intensity–time trajectories in panel (A) with eq 2. Error bars were obtained
from the error of the fitting with eq 2.

A ∼10-fold drop
in the reaction rate was recorded upon the
addition of ethanedithiol. The mismatch between the hard electrophile
(formyl moiety) and the soft nucleophile (thiol) may alter the mechanism
of the reaction, rendering the nucleophilic attack the rate-determining
step. We also observed a ca. 2-fold larger emission enhancement in
the presence of ethanedithiol consistent with the larger stability
of thioacetals (and presumably hemithioacetals) versus acetals (and
hemiacetals).31

Equilibrium
To
determine the product(s) formed in the
reactions of our palette with various alcohol nucleophiles, we prepared
and isolated the meso-acetal BODIPY 6 from its precursor 5 (Figure 5A) by stirring at 80 °C with ethylene
glycol in the presence of p-TsOH. Figure 5B shows the absorption and
emission spectra of acetal 6 in ethylene glycol in comparison
to those of 5 dissolved in ethylene glycol, where the
hemiacetal and acetal may both form. The absorption and emission maxima
of 5 (reacted) and 6 in this solvent were
markedly different (λabs = 502 nm and λem = 537 nm versus λabs = 514 nm and λem = 556 nm, respectively). The marked difference recorded
between the spectra of the isolated acetal and the product obtained
upon the addition of ethylene glycol to compound 5 highlights
the predominant formation of hemiacetal (rather than acetal) in solutions
of compound 5 in acetonitrile in the presence of either
methanol or other alcohols studied herein (vide supra). In addition,
fluorescence lifetimes of 5 and 6 were markedly
different in ethylene glycol (Table S1).
A similar conclusion would also apply to reactions with less electrophilic
compounds 1–4. Importantly, the poor solubility
of compounds 1–5 in acetonitrile/methanol mixtures
precluded the use of NMR toward monitoring the reaction mixture.

Photophysics of Reaction Mixtures
We next revisited
the final intensities reached at equilibrium for various nucleophiles
and compounds 1–5 studied herein to extract information
on yields. In addition to providing a qualitative understanding on
the extent of reaction completion at equilibrium, the emission intensities
recorded, when combined with fluorescence quantum yields for the emissive
products obtained and with their fluorescence decay rate constant
values kdec (or their reciprocal, fluorescence
decay lifetimes τdec), may provide a quantitative
yield of the product formed in our palette upon the reaction with
nucleophiles without the need of product isolation. Specifically,
by measuring the apparent emission quantum yield (Φfapp) of solutions
of 1–5 in 1.09 M methanol with p-TsOH (0.333 mM) and estimating the actual emission quantum yield
of the hemiacetals formed (Φf), one may estimate
the product yield of hemiacetal, a transient species, from the ratio
of the above two values, that is, yield = Φfapp/Φf.

Comparison of the fluorescence of the solutions of 1–5 in 1.09 M methanol and p-TsOH, with the fluorescence
from the solutions of standard compounds whose emission quantum yield
is known (specifically ethyl-substituted PM605 and the analogous H-substituted
dye),18 yielded values of Φfapp for our palettes 1–5 in methanol (see Table 1). Although it is not possible to isolate
a hemiacetal and directly measure its emission quantum yield, we obtained
this parameter utilizing eq 3 by assuming that the radiative decay rate constant for these
compounds is comparable to that of their meso-hydroxymethyl
BODIPY analogues18 (i.e., krad ≈ 1 × 108 s–1) and by incorporating the τdec values measured
for solutions of 1–5 in the presence of 1.09 M
methanol and p-TsOH (Table 1). It is safe to estimate krad ≈ 1 × 108 s–1 for hemiacetals considering that similar krad values were recorded for all meso-hydroxymethyl
BODIPY analogues of compounds 1–5 and for compound 6 (Table S1). This value is also
typically reported in the literature for BODIPY dyes.18,32Tables 1 and 2 list yields of reactions based on τdec and Φfapp for solutions of compounds 1–5 in methanol and p-TsOH and also for compound 3 in the presence
of various alcohols, water, and ethanedithiol and in the presence
of p-TsOH. 3   4

d Yield was calculated from the ratio
of Φfapp and Φf.

The above yield estimations based on photophysical properties assumed
that a sole product was formed; however, should an acetal and a hemiacetal
coexist, their intrinsic fluorescence lifetimes and emission quantum
yields would enable a similar analysis, decoupling their contributions
to the overall emission recorded and providing a direct readout on
the yield of each compound.

Importantly, we found that the hemiacetals
formed from the symmetric
BODIPYs (1, 2, and 4) gave
monoexponential lifetimes, whereas hemiacetals formed from the asymmetric
BODIPYs (3 and 5) gave biexponential lifetimes
as did compound 6 (Table S1). The two-component lifetimes for 3, 5, and 6 may be rationalized by the formation of atropisomers.
The meso-position of the BODIPY core is sterically
crowded because of the methyl groups at positions C1 and C7. This
crowding has been shown to give rise to atropisomers from asymmetric
BODIPYs.33 Because the BODIPY core is asymmetric
in compounds 3, 5, and 6 and
the meso-position of BODIPY is sterically hindered
(preventing rotation), formation of two atropisomers is a plausible
outcome. In our analysis, we considered an average fluorescence decay
lifetime based on the pre-exponential factors (amplitude) to estimate
the yield for the atropisomer formation.

Conclusions
We
have described herein a simple and rapid method and ensuing
analysis for characterizing the reaction of nucleophiles with a series
of fluorogenic meso-formyl BODIPY dyes. Our off/on
fluorogenic reactivity palette relies on the nucleophilic addition
to the formyl moiety that transforms the otherwise nonemissive meso-formyl BODIPY into an emissive meso-hemiacetal BODIPY. Our reactivity palette shows an LFER between
the reactivity and the oxidation potentials of the meso-formyl BODIPY dyes used, where the negative slope retrieved implies
an acid-catalyzed reaction. In turn, an LFER with a positive correlation
between reduction potentials and reaction yield (proportional to the
equilibrium constant under our experimental conditions) highlights
the product stabilization with lowering of the LUMO of the reacting
electrophile. The lifetimes and apparent quantum yields recorded for
the palette upon reaction with nucleophiles allow for an estimation
of the reaction yield of the transient hemiacetal species and the
number and types of fluorescent products formed without the need for
product isolation. In general, we anticipate that the analysis described
herein will be of broad application to fluorescence-based assays especially
when the formation of more than one product is expected.

Experimental
Section
Materials
High-performance liquid chromatography grade
solvents for spectroscopy were purchased from Fisher Scientific. 8-Acetoxymethyl-2,6-diethyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-pyrromethene
fluoroborate (PM605) was purchased from Exciton, Inc. (Dayton, OH).
All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Co. and were
used without further purification.

Instrumentation
Absorption spectra were recorded using
a Hitachi U-2800 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. Luminescence
spectra were recorded using a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer
using 1 cm × 1 cm quartz cuvettes and corrected for detector
sensitivity. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were
recorded on a Varian VNMRS 500 instrument at 500 and 126 MHz, respectively.
Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were measured on a Thermo
Scientific Exactive Orbitrap.

Time-Based Fluorescent
Enhancements
Time-based fluorescent
measurements were recorded on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer
equipped with a four-position Peltier with motorized turret. Glass
fluorimetry cells (3 mL) with 1 cm path lengths were used as sample
cells. The excitation and emission slits were set to 2 nm. The temperature
control was set to 21 °C. Solutions of dyes 1–5 in acetonitrile (3 mL final volume) were prepared in cuvettes at
concentrations such that each solution had an absorbance of 0.1 at
the excitation wavelength (i.e., 16, 20, 4.5, 16, and 3 μM for
dyes 1–5, respectively). Each solution was supplemented
with 0.333 mM p-TsOH (unless otherwise indicated).
When ready to measure intensity over time, the nucleophile of interest (1.09 M, unless otherwise specified)
was added to each cuvette (final volume 3 mL). Compounds 1, 3, and 4 were excited at 500 nm, and
their emission was collected at 560 nm. Compounds 2 and 5 were excited at 475 nm, and their emission was collected
at 538 nm. The emission was background-corrected with an acetonitrile
blank.

Fluorescence Quantum Yield
Acetonitrile solutions of meso-acetoxymethyl BODIPY dyes:18 H2BOAc (8-acetoxymethyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl pyrromethene
fluoroborate) or PM605 was used as a standard to calculate the apparent
quantum yields of reaction mixtures of dyes 1–5 in acetonitrile treated with 1.09 M methanol and 0.333 mM p-TsOH (following the equilibration monitored via fluorescent
enhancement). meso-Hydroxymethyl BODIPY dye, HCNBOH
(8-hydroxymethyl-2-cyano-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl pyrromethene fluoroborate),18 was used as a standard to calculate the quantum
yield of 6 in acetonitrile. Absorption and emission spectra
of the standards and 6 were measured at five different
concentrations. Because the fluorescence of 1–5 is very sensitive to concentration, only single emission and absorbance
spectra were measured, following the reaction completion. The integrated
emission intensity versus absorbance was then plotted and fitted linearly.
Relative apparent quantum yields of fluorescence for reaction mixtures
of dyes 1–5 and the quantum yield of dye 6 with respect to the standard were obtained from eq 5, where Φx, Δ, and η refer to the fluorescence quantum yield, the
slope obtained from the above-mentioned plot, and the solvent refractive
index for the unknown (x) or standard (st) sample, respectively.

Emission spectra were recorded for solutions using excitation and
emission slits of 1.4 nm. 5  

Fluorescence Lifetime Studies
The fluorescence lifetime
measurements were carried out using a Picoquant FluoTime 200 Time-Correlated
Single Photon Counting setup employing a supercontinuum laser (WhiteLase
SC400-4, Fianium, Beverly, MA). Excitation wavelengths were spectrally
separated from the broadband emission by a computer-controlled acousto-optical
tunable filter (Fianium). Compounds 2, 5, and 6 were excited at 475 nm, and compounds 1, 3, and 4 were excited at 500
nm. The excitation rate was 10 MHz, and the detection frequency was
less than 100 kHz. Photons were collected at the magic angle. An instrument
response function was measured with colloidal silica beads and was
used to deconvolute the time profile of the excitation source from
the emission decay. Reduced chi-squared statistics were employed to
determine good fits to biexponential decays.

Synthesis
Compounds 1–5 were prepared
according to literature procedures18 where
spectroscopic data matched those of the reported materials.

Compound 5 (50 mg, 0.17 mmol)
was dissolved in dry toluene (5 mL) under argon. Ethylene glycol (0.5
mL) and p-TsOH (3 mg, 0.015 mmol, 0.09 equiv) were
added, and the solution was stirred for 4 days at 80 °C. The
solution was then diluted with ethyl acetate, washed two times with
saturated sodium bicarbonate, and washed once with brine. The organic
layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure. The title compound was purified using
flash column chromatography with hexanes/ethyl acetate (1:1) giving
an orange residue (9.5 mg, 17%). 1H NMR (500 MHz; CDCl3): δ 6.27 (s, 1H), 6.02 (s, 1H), 4.27–4.24 (m,
