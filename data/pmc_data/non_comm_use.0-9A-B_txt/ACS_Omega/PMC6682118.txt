Chemical dyes are used in a wide
range of anthropogenic activities
and are generally not biodegradable. Hence, sustainable recycling
processes are needed to avoid their accumulation in the environment.
A one-step synthesis of Fecore–maghemiteshell (Fe–MM) for facile, instantaneous, cost-effective, sustainable,
and efficient removal of brilliant green (BG) dye from water has been
reported here. The homogenous and monolayer type of adsorption is,
to our knowledge, the most efficient, with a maximum uptake capacity
of 1000 mg·g–1, for BG on Fe–MM. This
adsorbent was shown to be efficient in occurring in time-scales of
seconds and to be readily recyclable (ca. 91%). As iron/iron oxide
possesses magnetic behavior, a strong magnet could be used to separate
Fe–MM coated with BG. Thus, the recycling process required
a minimum amount of energy. Capping Fe–MM by hydrophilic clay
minerals further enhanced the BG uptake capacity, by reducing unwanted
aggregation. Interestingly, capping the adsorbent by hydrophobic plastic
(low-density polyethylene) had a completely inverse effect on clay
minerals. BG removal using this method is found to be quite selective
among the five common industrial dyes tested in this study. To shed
light on the life cycle analysis of the composite in the environment,
the influence of selected physicochemical factors (T, pH, hν, O3, and NO2) was examined, along with four types of water samples (melted snow,
rain, river, and tap water). To evaluate the potential limitations
of this technique, because of likely competitive reactions with metal
ion contaminants in aquatic systems, additional experiments with 13
metal ions were performed. To decipher the adsorption mechanism, we
deployed four reducing agents (NaBH4, hydrazine, LiAlH4, and polyphenols in green tea) and NaBH4, exclusively,
favored the generation of an efficient adsorbent via aerial oxidation.
The drift of electron density from electron-rich Fecore to maghemite shells was attributed to be responsible for the electrostatic
adsorption of N+ in BG toward Fe–MM. This technology
is deemed to be environmentally sustainable in environmental remediation,
namely, in waste management protocol.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Dye
molecules usually consist of complex aromatic frameworks and
exhibit bright colors. Such aromatic frameworks also exhibit long-term
stability, preventing biodegradation.1 Extensive
and versatile usage of dye generates serious pollution problems in
environmental water bodies. Dyes mainly enter food products via industrial
emissions (beverage industries, waste water of textiles, printing
practices, etc.), causing serious health hazards.2,3

The great visibility of dyes, even at trace concentrations, is
generally related to less-dissolved oxygen in aquatic habitats, decreasing
the penetration of sunlight along with photosynthetic activities.
In this way, ecological harm may spread downstream to agricultural
or aquaculture regions, affecting aquatic flora and fauna. It is,
therefore, obligatory for some places to exercise proper treatment
before the disposal of such wastewater.4

Brilliant green (BG) products include a group of dye compounds
which have many uses, namely, biological staining, dermatological
agent, veterinary medicine, and inhibitor of mold/intestinal parasites/fungus
propagation.3 Global demand for coatings
and paints is predicted to rise 3.7 percent per year to 54.7 million
metric tons in 2020, valued at $193 billion.5 The growing consumer demand for dye compounds in various end-use
segments (such as plastics, textiles, food, and paints & coating)
is projected to act as a major growth factor for the global market
over the following few years.6

Accumulation
of dyes in the environment, as nearly indestructible
toxicants, is thereby a great concern. BG, a widely used dye,7,8 travels to incorporate itself in aquatic systems (highly soluble,
100 g/L) and in the atmosphere (because of high volatility of the
aromatic compound). Thereby, the development of green recycling processes
are warranted.

In the past decade, there have been considerable
efforts to remove
BG from water. Biological molecules, zinc oxide, and activated carbon
are very common in comparison to other sorbents. We have summarized
the results of BG removal capacities of different groups in Table
S1, Supporting Information. The use of
iron oxide in this context is rare (Ishaq et al.9) and magnetite impregnated bentonite, reported by Ishaq
et al., is probably the most efficient BG adsorbent (877 mg·g–1) so far.9 However, maximum
uptake capacity, time, recyclability, applicable conditions/versatility,
cost, and simplicity of operation are some major challenges for the
prototype/industrial use.10

Highly
environmentally available iron and iron oxide (a major component
of airborne dust particles)11 have also
been found to be of great interest in environmental remediation and
understanding of atmospheric processes.12−14 The surface morphology
and passivation/capping of the nanoparticles can be manipulated to
obtain a fruitful remediation application. The property of water affinity
(hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) of the surface is also noteworthy
in this regard.12−16

To have versatile applicability of a proposed remediation
technique,
the effect of environment and co-contaminants in environmentally available
conditions should be accounted for carefully, along with the rate,
sustainability, efficiency, cost, and simplicity of the designed method.12,17,18

This research is aimed
at the development of a recyclable and sustainable
protocol for BG dyes. As such, an efficient synthesis process of maghemite
(Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3)-coated
Fe composite, Fe–MM, was developed for the recycling of the
BG dye. The constituents of Fe–MM were natural, nontoxic, and
widely available in the airborne dust particles and soil. The process
was found to not only be fast, cost-effective, and facile, but also
the most efficient, to the best of our knowledge. We studied the effect
of environmental conditions, surface manipulations, and the effect
of coating on adsorbent efficiency. We will herein discuss the potential
of a new reagent for recycling of the anthropogenic dye in the environment.
We also explore the role of reducing agents during the synthesis of
Fe–MM and the strength and limitation of the green method.

2 Results and Discussion
We performed complementary synthesis,
characterization, and adsorption
studies. The following section explores all systematic steps related
to our results and the implication of this research.

2.1 Fe–MM:
A Highly Efficient Adsorbent
for BG
We found Fe–MM to be the most efficient and
a fast adsorbent to adsorb BG at room temperature, and absorbance
(at 623 nm) of the BG solution was dramatically decreased in the presence
of Fe–MM. We have compared our maximum adsorption capacity
(Qm) of 1.00 g·g–1 with 47 other adsorbents in Table S1, Supporting Information. To the best of our knowledge, Qm ≥ 1 has not been reported so far.

Fe powder,
maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), hematite (α-Fe2O3), and magnetite (Fe3O4) are all vastly commercially and environmentally available.19−21 However, unlike Fe–MM, they could not at all adsorb BG [Figure 1a]. We used nanopowders
of maghemite (<50 nm), hematite (30–50 nm), magnetite (50–70
nm), and Fe (35–45 nm) from Sigma-Aldrich. However, they could
not at all decrease the absorbance of BG in water. Hence, the synergism
between maghemite and Fe in Fe–MM made Fe–MM an efficient
adsorbent of BG.

Figure 1 (a) Digital image representing the removal of BG from
water using
Fe–MM; comparison of removal capacity of (b) BG with different
Fe compounds, (c) different dyes with Fe–MM, and (d) 10 mL
of different BG concentrations with 1.0 mg of Fe–MM.

It is to be noted that such commercially
available Fe/Fe-oxides
enhanced the absorbance of BG, probably because of the breakage of
self-aggregation of the dye molecules.22,23 The %removal1 (PR) was ∼77.2 for 10 mL of 100 mg/L BG
with 1.0 mg of Fe–MM and insignificant with the same mass of
other Fe/Fe-oxides, as obtained from absorption spectra [Figure 1b]. 1  where C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of BG in the solution, respectively.

We also replaced BG dye
by other commonly available industrial
dyes (safranin-O, malachite green, methylene blue, and rhodamine B)
and discovered that PR was insignificant for other dyes. Even though
the chemical structure of BG (triarylmethane dye) is closely related
to malachite green, Fe–MM could remove BG selectively, indicating
the specificity of Fe–MM as a BG adsorbent [Figure 1c]. N donor in a BG molecule
(attached to the −C2H5 group) was less
effectively involved in resonance than with malachite green (attached
to the −CH3 group) because of steric reason, causing
strong attachment with Fe–MM.

The concentration of BG
was varied (25–130 mg/L) with a
fixed mass (1.0 mg) of Fe–MM and PR was decreased gradually
with the increased concentration of BG, as shown in Figure 1d.

Fe–MM was shown
to be an efficient adsorbent for BG, and
the adsorption process was determined to be physisorption. In physisorption,
the electronic structure of the atom or molecule is hardly perturbed
upon the process of adsorption. It is mainly caused by van der Waals
forces. Such intermolecular forces depend on the nature of molecules
and the distance between them. Thus, selectivity comes in physisorption.
Leed et al.24 have reported the relation
of electronic structure in physisorption and chemisorption. Fe–MM
was selective to BG because of the specificity of the electronic structure
in binding sites of the adsorbents and interaction sites of the adsorbates.

2.2 Characterization of Fe–MM
To extensively
understand the properties of Fe–MM, we characterized
Fe–MM using several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques
[Figure 2]. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analyses indicated that Fe–MM was a mixture of Fe (47.60%)
and maghemite (52.40%) [Figure S1, Supporting Information]. As X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
indicated the property of the surface, we found ∼100% Fe in
Fe–MM at +3 oxidation states. The binding energies [∼710.78
eV for Fe(III) 2p3/2 and ∼724.42 eV for Fe(III)
2p1/2, respectively] correspond to Fe(III) of maghemite.25

Figure 2 (a) Compositional analysis from XRD of Fe–MM; (b)
wide-range
and high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe–MM; (c) TEM and HRTEM
image of Fe–MM; and (d) high- and low-resolution SEM image
of Fe–MM.

Likewise, the positions
of the satellite peaks for the Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks are also very sensitive to
the iron oxidation states and are often considered for qualitative
determination of the ionic states of Fe [Figure 2]. They clearly indicated that the surface
of Fe–MM was maghemite, because of aerial oxidation of Fe.
The in situ-produced maghemite, covering the Fe core, was likely the
main adsorbent. Thus, Fe–MM was Fecore–maghemiteshell.

For further characterizations of Fe–MM,
we performed transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis.
Fe–MM was composed of nanowires with ∼30 nm diameter,
consisting of linearly arranged nanospheres. A lattice fringe of 0.29
nm is the indication of the (220) plane of maghemite.26 In another region, we found the indication of the (111)
plane of inverse spinel maghemite [fringe spacing of 0.470 nm] as
well as the (101) plane of goethite [fringe spacing of 0.409 nm].27,28 Such an observation, again, supported that Fe–MM was Fe–Fe
oxide core–shell material. However, we did not observe any
sharp dark–fade contrast core–shell image in TEM.29 One thereby might consider that the surface
of Fe–MM was rich with Fe–MM, whereas elemental Fe remained
mostly inside.

Fe–MM was found to be a long prickly iron
nanowire (of diameter
∼30 nm), formed via linear aggregation of nanospheres [scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image]. Thus, Fe–MM looked similar
to the root of a ginger tree, as an aggregate under a scanning electron
microscope. Such nano-ginger has been disclosed to be a highly efficient
adsorbent for BG in this paper.

2.3 Adsorption
Isotherm for Maximal Uptake
To evaluate the efficacy of BG
removal from water via Fe–MM
nano-ginger, a nano-trap, a fixed amount of BG (10 mL of 100 mg/L)
was added to various masses of Fe–MM. After that, our data
were fitted using three adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Elovich) to obtain the value of maximum adsorption capacity [Figure 3].30 For the case of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, homogenous
adsorption sites and monolayer coverage are assumed, and the following
equation is followed. 2  Ce and qe denote the equilibrium concentration of BG
(mg L–1) in solution and adsorbed BG (g) per gram
of Fe–MM, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) was calculated from the slope of the best-fitted
straight line of Ce/qe against Ce.

Figure 3 (a) Amount of BG adsorbed
per unit mass of Fe–MM (qe) vs
the solution phase concentration of BG
(Ce) at equilibrium; the fit to the linearized
form of the (b) Langmuir adsorption isotherm, (c) Freundlich adsorption
isotherm, and (d) Elovich adsorption isotherm.

Heterogeneous adsorption sites are considered in the Freundlich
adsorption isotherm, with the following equation. 3  

The slope of the best-fitted straight line of log(qe) versus log(Ce) gives the
adsorption intensity (n) and Freundlich constant
(KF). Qm can
be found by substituting Ce by C0 (initial BG concentration in solution).

The Elovich adsorption isotherm describes multilayer adsorption,
with the following equation. 4  

The data of adsorption,
closer to 100%, were excluded during the
plotting of adsorption isotherms, as isotherms are valid, when there
is equilibrium between BG in the solution and the adsorbent. The Qm for Langmuir was calculated to be 1.00 g·g–1 and R2 (the coefficient
of determination) was 0.997. This adsorption procedure did not really
follow Freundlich and Elovich adsorption isotherms (R2 were 0.732 and 0.667, respectively). Therefore, homogeneous
and monolayer coverage of BG on Fe–MM with Qm of 1.00 g·g–1 was inferred.

The crucial characteristics of the Langmuir isotherm are expressed
by a dimensionless constant, equilibrium parameter RL.31 5  where KL and C0 denote the Langmuir
constant and the highest
initial dye concentration (mg L–1), respectively.
The value of RL specifies the kind of
isotherm, that is, to be unfavorable (RL > 1), linear (RL = 1), favorable
(0
< RL < 1), or irreversible (RL = 0). The absolute RL value (0.0086) in our experiment is in between zero and one,
signifying that the adsorption of BG onto Fe–MM is favorable.
Moreover, the value of RL is closer to
zero, indicating that the process is as favorable as a spontaneous
process (KL is 1.155 L mg–1).

2.4 Rate of Adsorption
The adsorption
process, reported here, was very fast. BG got adsorbed within 30 s
of coming in contact with Fe–MM nano-ginger. According to the
previous literature, adsorbents have needed a significant time for
the adsorption process, often a couple of hours.1,32 The
slow adsorption process is a major limitation for the prototype and
industrial usage.33

The fast adsorption
made the Fe–MM surface highly useful to remove BG from water
bodies, in the context of environmental remediation. It is a pseudo-first-order
heterogeneous reaction.30 Because of the
rapidity of the reaction, a rate constant could not be measured. Easy
separation of the adsorbed dye on magnetic particles using only a
magnet was an extra facility.

2.5 Recovery
of BG
The adsorption of
BG on the Fe–MM surface was likely physisorption in nature,
because the adsorbed BG was readily recovered by washing Fe–MM
with copious amounts of water. We were able to recover 91% of BG by
aging Fe–MM–BG (obtained by shaking 1 mg of Fe–MM
with 10 mL of 100 mg/L) in 8 L of water for 2 h. The spectroscopic
signature of BG remained unaltered after recovery. As such, the experimental
protocol used in this study is seemingly sustainable and requires
minimal energy. By mild heating (40 °C), the process of 89% recovery
of BG can be done within 0.5 h.

2.6 Recyclability
of Fe–MM
We
performed the BG adsorption experiment for several cycles using the
same Fe–MM after washing with water. The values of PR were
found to be 77.2, 67.2, 55.2, and 41.8 for the 1st cycle, 2nd cycle,
3rd cycle, and 4th cycle, respectively [Figure 4a]. Because of the high affinity of BG, complete
removal of BG from the Fe–MM surface was a slow process, requiring
many washes. Active sites of Fe–MM might be blocked/changed
to some extent because of the aggregation of the nano-ginger or for
being immersed in water for a long time, exhibiting a gradual decrease
of adsorption capacity. It is interesting to state that Fe and maghemite
in Fe–MM were converted to magnetite (100%) after a few cycles
of the BG removal process [Figures 4b and S2, Supporting Information]. In other words, BG adsorption was physisorption, but Fe–MM
changed its composition during the process of recovery of BG from
Fe–MM.

Figure 4 PR of 1 mg of Fe–MM in 10 mL of 100 mg/L BG solution
at
different (a) cycles, (c) temperatures, and (d) pHs; (b) XRD spectrum
and composition analysis of Fe–MM after the fourth cycle.

There were some practical reasons
for the gradual decrease in the
uptake capacity of Fe–MM. They include:(a) During the BG recovery
process, Fe–MM
was sonicated in water for ∼2 h. Thus, rusting of elemental
Fe and some inactivation of active sites might take place.

(b) Fe–MM had a strong
affinity
for BG. Hence, complete recovery of BG was not possible in a green
and energetically efficient way (no heat or no chemicals). Consequently,
further BG uptake capacity was decreased by Fe–MM.

(c) Because of the presence
of copious
amounts of water during BG recovery, collection of suspended Fe–MM
by a magnet was not quantitative and the chances of loss of Fe–MM
were expected to be higher.



Oxidation
of iron in water is well established.34 In our experimental conditions, the maghemite coating of
iron and BG in water changed the formal potential to generate magnetite
at the end.

We found a similar adsorption spectrum of pure BG
and recovered
BG after the first and fourth cycles, indicating the purity of recovered
BG.

2.7 Life Cycle Analysis: Evaluation of Environmentally
Relevant Physicochemical Conditions on BG Removal Technology
To understand whether the protocol of water decontamination of water
from BG was applicable in various environmental conditions, we tested
the uptake capacity of BG in selected environmentally relevant physicochemical
conditions and established the versatility and limitation of the process.

2.7.1 Effect of Temperature
We investigated
the effect of temperature by gradually increasing the temperature.
The extent of adsorption and PR decreased gradually. PR was 79.9 at
0 °C, 77.2 at 20 °C, 72.4 at 40 °C, and 60.9 at 60
°C [Figure 4c].
For the case of physisorption,35,36 an equilibrium between
the fluid and the adsorbent is expected. The target molecules are
captured on the surface of the adsorbent via van der Waals forces,
with low heat of adsorption.

Chemisorption demands binding sites
on the surface, where the target molecules are attracted, forming
a covalent chemical bond with a higher heat of adsorption, roughly
identical to the heat of reaction. Adsorbents with lesser heats of
adsorption are much more sensitive to temperature. Enhanced temperatures
facilitate desorption in the case of physisorption and efficient collision
(between targets and binding sites because of the enhanced Brownian
motion) in the case of chemisorption.36 Thus, our observation of temperature dependence supports physisorption
processes, under experimental conditions used in this study.

2.7.2 Effect of pH
Investigating the
effect of pH is a matter of interest for the pollution control protocol,
as the earth water reservoirs depict diverse acidity.37 BG solution was found to have different absorbances (with
similar ∼λmax = 623 nm) depending on the pH.
The BG solution was green, blue, and cyan (with suspending sulphur
as colloid) at acidic, neutral, and alkaline pHs, respectively.

We found that lower pHs (pH 2) had the highest removal capacity of
BG in the presence of Fe–MM. The PR at variable pHs were as
follows, as shown in Figure 4d:

2 (84.7%) > 4 (70.0%) < 6 (77.2%) > 8 (58.2%)
< 10 (66.6%).

It is mentionable that aging of BG at high
pH (pH 10) for over
an hour produced a colorless solution, probably because of the irreversible
oxidation of BG. It is important to note that we obtained a similar
colorless BG solution by prolonged bubbling of O3 gas in
BG solution at neutral pH. Removal of such oxidized BG could not be
monitored by absorption spectroscopy.

After treating colorless
BG solution with Fe–MM, washing
of Fe–MM with water, and decreasing the pH could not bring
back the colored solution of BG, implying the conversion to be likely
an irreversible redox process. It is to be noted that we adjusted
the pH of the solution using only HCl and NaOH.

2.7.3 Effect of hν, O3, and NO2
Iron (Fe0) and maghemite,
the main constituents of the adsorbent Fe–MM, are widely available
in the earth’s atmosphere.38,39 They have
been classified as sustainable materials by different groups.40,41 Dust particles are very often formed via the aggregation of such
iron particles with clay materials.42 In
this context, we investigated the effect of several environmentally
available physicochemical conditions on the adsorption of BG on Fe–MM
[Figure 5a].

Figure 5 Effect of environmentally
relevant physicochemical conditions on
Fe–MM to observe BG adsorption capacity, (a) schematic representation
and (b) PR; (c1,c2) represent the composition from XRD analysis after
UV A and UV A + NO2 treatment on Fe–MM, respectively;
(d1–d3) represent SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of Fe–MM
after UV A + NO2 treatment, respectively.

As mentioned in 2.7.1 and 2.7.2, enhancement of temperatures increased the
desorption capacity
of BG from Fe–MM and lowering of pH enhanced adsorption, whereas
increasing the pH favored oxidation of the dye.

The sun is the
fundamental source of radiation to our planet, including
ultraviolet rays. Seasonal variation of exposure levels of UV radiation
has been demonstrated by Rafieepour et al.43 Yet, the energetic UV will be removed in substantial amounts in
the atmosphere by ozone molecules. As such, predominantly the ultraviolet
radiation, reaching the earth surface, is UV A (∼315–400
nm). To mimic solar radiation, we performed experiments in which we
exposed 15 W UV A light (Hitachi) to dry solid Fe–MM for 5–60
min. It was found that the PR of the exposed Fe–MM decreased
(%) slightly, even after 1 h of exposure, indicating that the Fe–MM
adsorbent was robust for UV exposure, under experimental conditions.
There was also an insignificant change of PR, when Fe–MM in
BG solution was exposed to radiation, as shown in Figure 5.

Ozone and NOx (NO and
NO2) are produced from natural
and anthropogenic sources and are present in the environment in a
significant quantity.44 O3 is
a greenhouse gas (mainly formed via photochemical oxidation of carbon
monoxide and volatile organic compounds).45

NO2 is also a source of O3 via photochemical
reaction.46 6  and 7  

Furthermore, ozone-initiated
reactions are known to start a series
of secondary reactions, which lead to the formation of reactive radicals,
such as OH and HO2, in the troposphere.47

OH radicals were produced via the reaction 8  followed by the reaction 9  

We bubbled ozone in the BG solution with Fe–MM
for 5 s.
We also aged Fe–MM with O3 (100 ppb) gas for 1 h
in a gas-tight three-neck round bottom flask in the dark and under
UV-A (315–400 nm). For all the cases, an insignificant change
of PR was observed. The adsorbent Fe–MM could efficiently withstand
exposure to O3 [Figure 5b].

We performed additional sets of experiments
using NO2 gas. Bubbling and aging had an insignificant
effect on BG adsorption
capacity, under our experimental conditions. On the contrary, aging
under UV A light greatly reduced the adsorption capacity of Fe–MM.
Consequently, the potential in situ-generated NO changed the surface
and composition of Fe–MM, diminishing BG adsorption efficiency.

Composition analysis of Fe–MM after (NO2 + UV
A) treatment indicated 9.8% magnetite and 90.2% Fe. Fe–MM with
only UV A treatment produced 92.5% magnetite and 7.5% Fe [Figure 5c, Figures S3 and
S4, Supporting Information]. Hence, Fe
present in the core is not the adsorbent. Synergism of Fe and iron
oxide was responsible for the adsorption process.

It is to be
noted that Fe–MM possessed wire-like morphology
after (NO2 + UV A) treatment, as confirmed from SEM and
TEM analysis. The HRTEM image showed ∼0.2 nm fringe spacing,
characteristic of the (110) plane of Fe [Figure 5d].48

2.7.4 Effect of Co-Contaminating Metal Ions: A
Limitation
Natural water may be composed of various metal
ions. The influence of co-polluting metal ions was hence investigated.
We sonicated 10 mL of BG (100 mg/L) with 1.0 mg of Fe–MM. The
solution became colorless as BG got adsorbed on Fe–MM (Fe–MM–BG),
and 1 mL 10–2 M of different metal ions (Al3+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, Pb2+, Sn2+, and Zn2+) was added and sonicated with Fe–MM–BG.

After 10 min, we measured the absorbance of the supernatant. It
was found that Al3+, Cu2+, Fe3+,
Hg2+, and Pb2+ caused significant desorption
of BG in solution after 10 min, being adsorbed on the Fe–MM
surface [Figure 6].
Thus, the presence of some specific metal ions in the aqueous medium
limited the application of the technology.

Figure 6 Recovery of BG from water
Fe–MM–BG, using different
metal ions.

The high charge density
of Al3+ was attributed to be
the main reason for the highest rate of releasing BG from Fe–MM.
We shall refer to the solid obtained after a 10 min sonication of
Fe–MM–BG with Al3+ as Fe–MM–BG–Al.
Thus, the replacement reaction, based on affinity of the metal ions
toward Fe/maghemite, generated free BG in the solution.

The
metal ions remained hydrated in the solution and thereby the
hydrodynamic radii of the metal ions were responsible for the desorption
of BG. Thus, effective surface charge density and diffusion ability
(mobility) would be related to hydrodynamic radii. Tourinho et al.49 have reported the role of hydrodynamic radii
and mobility of the ions. Al3+, in our case, was found
to be likely the best BG recovering cations, considering all the factors
under the environmental conditions used in this study.

As the
adsorption process was much faster in comparison to some
metal-induced desorption process, this protocol could be useful in
the textile industry. Moreover, the used concentration of metal ions
in Figure 6 was elevated
(10–2 M). Industry effluents usually have metal
ion concentrations less than that as co-pollutants. This study evaluated
the effect of metal ions to understand the extreme situations, along
with relative diffusion ability and mobility, and hydrodynamic radii,
from a fundamental point of view. Masking of metal ions can also be
performed before BG removal. Miura50 have
indeed reported the masking protocol of metal ions during spectroscopic
analysis.

The present protocol can also be an efficient platform
for the
sensing of metal ions in the effluents.

2.7.4.1 Characterization
of Fe–MM–BG
and Fe–MM–BG–Al
As depicted in Figure 7, XPS studies indicated
that Fe in Fe–MM–BG was in an Fe(III) oxidation state
[binding energy of 711.00 eV corresponds to Fe(III) 2p3/2], supporting the magnetite phase of iron oxide.51 Slightly higher binding energy was due to the capture of
electron density of iron by N+ of BG, suggesting a clue
for the mechanism of the adsorption process. The wire-like morphology
of Fe–MM was extensively aggregated in Fe–MM–BG,
as obtained from SEM and TEM images. The lattice fringe of 0.289 and
0.295 nm indicated the (220) plane of magnetite [Figure 7].

Figure 7 (a1–a4) represent
wide-range and high-resolution (Fe) XPS,
SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of Fe–MM–BG, respectively;
(b1–b4) represent wide-range and high-resolution (Fe) XPS,
SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of Fe–MM–BG–Al, respectively.

XPS studies indicated that Fe
in Fe–MM–BG–Al
was in the Fe(III) oxidation state [binding energy of 710.47 eV corresponds
to Fe(III) 2p3/2].51 Decrease
of binding energy was due to the release of electron density of iron
by N+ of BG. The morphology of Fe–MM–BG–Al
was mostly wire-like, as obtained from SEM and TEM images. The lattice
fringe of 0.489 and 0.247 nm indicated the (111) and (311) planes
of magnetite, respectively [Figure 7].52

2.8 Environmental Water Analysis
The
removal of BG from environmental water samples was investigated using
water from Saint Lawrence river (Montreal, Canada), tap water (McGill
University, Canada), melted snow (near Burnside Hall, McGill University),
and rain water (Montreal).

Each environmental aquatic sample
of 50 mL was studied by adding different quantities of BG. Then, Fe–MM
was added to decontaminate water from BG. We found that BG removal
was satisfactory for all the samples, supporting the usefulness of
this technique for real environmentally available samples [Table S2, Supporting Information].

The compositions
of natural snow and water are quite diverse around
the world and include wide ranges of trace and ultratrace components.
There is also a significant variability in the compositions of snow
and water samples. In this study, similar samples were taken for another
field research in this laboratory. As such, elemental analysis, total
organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon analyses were performed.
Triple quad-induced coupled plasma mass spectrometry (QQQ-ICP-MS/MS)
analysis, along with total carbon and dissolved organic carbon determination
of molten snow samples indicated a suite of elements, which are shown
in the Supporting Information (Table S3).
These analyses led to the quantification of a significant organic
carbon presence (2.30 g/m3 including 1.17 g/m3 of dissolved organic compounds) as well as metals such as Al, Cr,
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Sr, Cd, Ba, Pb, U, and Hg. The quantification
of metals is given in the Supporting Information. More detailed measurements of various snow and natural water samples
around the city of Montreal have been shown previously.53−56

2.9 Effect of the Capping Agents on the Adsorbent
2.9.1 Clay Minerals: Hydrophilic Capping Agent
Iron, in various
forms, was found to be in clay minerals. We synthesized
kaolin-, montmorillonite-, and sepiolite-capped Fe–MM composites,
KaFe–MM, MtFe–MM, and SpFe–MM.16 Such passivation was also helpful to decrease the possibility
of unwanted aggregations of the nanoparticles, increasing the surface
area of the adsorbent and such passivated adsorbents were hydrophilic.20 One milligram of KaFe, MtFe, and SpFe had PR
of 80.2, 79.9, and 73.1%, whereas it was 77.2% for Fe–MM (in
10 mL of 100 mg/L BG solution). It is noteworthy that the main adsorbents,
that is, Fe compounds, were almost half in clay material-passivated
adsorbents, in comparison to Fe–MM.

In our previous study,20 we have reported clay mineral (namely kaolin)-passivated
Fe–MM during the synthesis of Fe–MM. From contact angle
measurement, we also concluded20 that such
clay mineral-passivated Fe–MM was hydrophilic in nature. We
herein found that such clay mineral-passivated Fe–MM enhanced
the removal of BG.

2.9.2 Plastic: Hydrophobic
Capping Agent
One of the most alarming and emerging contaminants
in water is plastic
in various forms such as nanoplastics, microplastics, and in bulk.
Though plastics are not soluble in water, yet micro- and nanoplastics
can be suspended in water, and are recognized to be potential hazards.
Yet, there is some technological advancement to recycling plastic,
and easy recognition of plastic in water is still a challenge.16

We performed a suite of additional experiments
to decipher the role of a hydrophobic coating of common plastic on
Fe–MM adsorbent efficiency. A piece of transparent low-density
polyethylene (plastic) bag of 25 mg was kept inside 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solvent for 48 h and then the piece of plastic was removed from
THF. As such, THF was statured with plastic (p-THF). Fe–MM
(2 mg) was sonicated separately in different volumes of p-THF (0.1–1.6
mL) and dried to obtain plastic-capped Fe–MM. The aqueous solution
of 10 mL of 100 mg/L BG was sonicated and we observed that Fe–MM
treated with more p-THF had lesser PR. Figure 8 denotes a monotonous inverse relation of
p-THF and PR. Our BG recycle protocol is, thus, a promising technology
of suspended plastic particles in water. The inefficient BG adsorption
of plastic-coated Fe–MM was due to the increased hydrophobicity
and inactivation of the active sites of the adsorbent.

Figure 8 (a) Schematic representation
of colorimetric recognition of plastic
via the intensity of green color of BG; (b) absorption spectra of
BG with Fe–MM (modified by variable amounts of p-THF) and the
inset represents PR of BG with Fe–MM (modified by variable
amounts of p-THF).

We observed that the
common plastic was insoluble in common organic
solvents and water, but sufficiently soluble in THF (confirmed from
adsorption spectroscopy). Subsequently, p-THF was added in water,
leading to the formation of a white colloidal stable suspension. Our
plastic recognition protocol could be a potential colorimetric sensing
platform of plastic in water. Future studies are recommended to evaluate
the applicability of this discovery, as environmental sensors for
the detection of plastic contaminants in aquatic systems.

2.10 Role of a Reducing Agent in Post-oxidation
During the synthesis of Fe–MM, a reducing agent was required
to reduce Fe(II) to Fe(0). Aerial oxidation was responsible for subsequent
surface oxidation. To investigate the role of reducing agent in post-oxidation
processes, we used several well-known reducing agents, namely, sodium
borohydride (NaBH4),57 hydrazine
(N2H4),58 polyphenol
in green tea extract,59 and lithium aluminium
hydride (LiAlH4).60

All
of these reducing agents produced black-colored Fe(0) as soon as they
were added to the Fe(II) solution. Subsequently, aerial oxidation
produced different products. However, NaBH4 produced the
efficient adsorbent (Fe–maghemite composite) of BG. We found
that 77.2, −50, −24.1, and −3.9 were the PRs
for NaBH4, LiAlH4, N2H4, and polyphenols, respectively [Figure 9a].

Figure 9 (A) (a) PR of 1 g of Fe–MM, produced
from different reducing
agents, in 10 mL of 100 mg/L BG solution; (b–d) represent the
composition of Fe–MM, using N2H4, polyphenols,
and LiAlH4, respectively (obtained from XRD); (B) potential
mechanism of adsorption of BG on the Fe–MM surface, represented
schematically.

The constituents of Fe–MM,
produced from NaBH4, were Fe (47.6%) and maghemite (52.4%)
[Figure 2a]. The constituents
of Fe–MM, produced
from N2H4, were lepidocrocite (40.8%), akaganeite
(3.3%), magnetite (16.8%), and goethite (8.6%) [Figures 9b and S5, Supporting Information].

The constituents of Fe–MM, produced
from polyphenols of
green tea, were goethite (10.0%), akaganeite (19.2%), and bernalite
(70.8%) [Figures 9c
and S6]. The constituents of Fe–MM
produced from LiAlH4 were akaganeite (100.0%) [Figures 9d and S7, Supporting Information].

Except for NaBH4, all reducing agents caused complete
post-oxidation of Fe in different ways. Thereby, the post-oxidation
depended on the employed reducing agent, as found from compositional
analysis of XRD. Only NaBH4 directed proper post-oxidation,
forming an excellent adsorbent.

Notwithstanding that, the observed
negative data in Figure 9a had occurred as we found
that the absorbance of pure BG was set as 100%. However, some iron
compounds made a complex with BG, rendering a higher absorbance than
pure BG, leading to negative removal efficiency. However, negative
adsorption efficiency conclusively indicated that they were insignificantly
adsorbent for BG.

Pal et al.61 have
clearly proposed the
relation between the nucleophilicity of BH4– and the oxidation of Ag nanoparticles. Similarly, BH4–, a strong nucleophile, adsorbed on the surface
of zero-valent iron and decreased its reduction potential. Thus, Fe
might react rapidly with oxygen, making a coating of maghemite on
Fe. Therefore, further contact of Fe with oxygen could be hindered,
forming Fecore–maghemiteshell compounds,
an efficient adsorbent.

2.11 Potential Mechanism
The reduction
of Fe(II) by NaBH4, followed by aerial oxidation, produced
Fecore–maghemiteshell particle, an efficient
adsorbent of BG. When we used other reducing agents in lieu of NaBH4 during the synthesis of Fe–MM, the obtained product
did not possess any elemental Fe (as confirmed from XRD). Such treatments
significantly decreased adsorption capabilities.

Fe (being covered
by iron oxide of a specific phase) is important for BG adsorption
and exclusive employment of NaBH4 dictates such post-oxidation
in a perfect manner. Further research is still needed to understand
the insight into post-oxidation from morphological and electronic
ground.

(UV A + NO2) treatment greatly enhanced the
contribution
of Fe in Fe–MM, destroying BG adsorption ability. Consequently,
Fe with a surface coating of iron oxide (maghemite) was important
for it being an efficient adsorbent. The drift of electron density62,63 from electronically rich Fe to maghemite helped to attract N+ of BG. The enhancement of binding energy after BG adsorption
on the Fe–MM surface supports the excess electron density on
maghemite, before the BG adsorption.

Homogenous, monolayer,
and Langmuir type of physisorption might
cause repulsion of closely placed N+ in BG dye. HSO4–, as counter anions, prevented repulsion,
favoring the adsorption process, as depicted in Figure 9.

In this paper, to our knowledge,
we have disclosed one of the most
efficient inorganic adsorbents for decontamination of water from BG.
The adsorbent is inexpensive and sustainable, as iron oxides are largely
available in the environment, in soil, and in airborne dust particles,
which are found commonly in our planet. Furthermore, this method is
fast, does not require energy, and is shown to be recyclable.

Further experimentations and modeling studies are warranted to
establish the unequivocal mechanism, relating to oxidation states,
phase, morphology, composition, and crystal plane.

2.12 Sustainable Technology
We are here
presenting a new material, Fe–MM, with nano-ginger morphology,
for BG recycling technology with plastic recognition. The constituents
of Fe–MM were maghemite and Fe(0), both of which are ubiquitous
in the environment, and commonly observed in airborne dust particles.
Moreover, iron and iron oxide nanoparticles have been shown to be
biocompatible nanomaterials, having abundant applications in various
biomedical activities.64−66 In our procedure, no other toxic coating/passivating
agent was used for BG removal.

We synthesized Fe–MM by
reducing FeCl2 with NaBH4. It is important to
note that NaBH4 was used for the synthesis of Fe–MM,
but not for the adsorption process. Sodium metaborate (produced during
NaBH4-induced reduction) could be quantitatively be collected
and could be converted to NaBH4, using a previously described
method.67 10  

The proposed procedure is relatively
simple, fast, recyclable,
highly efficient for BG removal and recovery, energetically convenient,
and cost-effective. Because of the suite of experiments to evaluate
its life cycle analysis upon relative environmental conditions such
as radiation, T, pH, co-pollutants, and atmospheric
oxidants, the proposed technology is sustainable.

A magnetic
adsorbent is helpful for facile and rapid separation,
without centrifugation or dialysis unlike other biocompatible adsorbents.68 All these features of our technique help to
make our technique effective for industrial applications as well as
academic research.

Adsorbents used in this study are iron-containing
compounds, and
sodium borohydride was washed away during the course of synthesis.
Though sodium borohydride is a fairly active reducing agent, it can
also be recycled from sodium metaborate.67 The involvement of NaBH4 in the synthesis is often considered
green by several groups.69,70 As such, one could
easily recover the adsorbed BG from Fe–MM. The adsorbent was
thereby recyclable and sustainable.

The Fe–MM, loaded
with BG, can be separated from water by
a magnet (as both Fe–MM and Fe–MM–BG were magnetic).
BG was recovered from Fe–MM, loaded with BG, by shaking it
in copious amounts of water. BG could thus be retrieved back, as mentioned
in 2.5. The protocol included the recycling
of the dye. Moreover, elevated temperature also released BG, although
the thermal method is not suitable energetically.

3 Conclusions
A cost-effective, fast, recyclable, efficient,
sustainable, and
simple protocol has been stated for the removal of BG to purify water.
The process is Langmuir-type physisorption and recyclable. The efficient
maximum adsorption is observed to be 1000 mg·g–1. The drift of electron density from core to shell is responsible
for such efficient adsorption. The adsorbent will open up a new area
of environmental remediation, using the constituent of airborne dust.
Not only BG, but also other toxic/hazardous materials may be eliminated
from the environment using a similar mechanism. The additional advantage
of magnetic adsorbents, like ours, is that they are easily separable
by a magnet. Instead of just removing the BG, this protocol allows
the removal of BG and recycling it with practically no energy and
high efficiency. Furthermore, in the course of this protocol, we synthesized
new materials, which can be used as added value, rendering our method
desirable for sustainable industrial applications. Our technology
has the potential to be an asset for waste management at industrial
scales. Such a protocol can also be used in fabric, food processing,
and water purification industries. Moreover, our colorimetric plastic
recognition strategy may open up a new mechanistic understanding of
environmental remediation and in finding a novel adsorbent for myriad
applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Supplies
All the reagents
were of analytical reagent grade and Milli-Q water was used throughout
the experiment. All metal salts, iron dust, and all iron oxides were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride, hydrazine, and lithium
aluminum hydroxide were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Hydrochloric acid,
different organic solvents, sodium hydroxide, and BG were purchased
from Fisher Scientific. All glassware were cleaned with freshly prepared
aqua regia, subsequently rinsed with copious amounts of distilled
water, and were dried well before use. All the reagents were used
without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis
of Fe–MM
A yellow
solution of 5.2 g of FeCl2·4H2O (60 mL)
was prepared in a 4:1 ethanol/water mixture. A solution of 200 mL
of a 1 M NaBH4 solution was made by dissolving required
solid NaBH4 in ice-cold Milli-Q water. The cold NaBH4 solution was slowly added into the FeCl2·4H2O solution in an ice-bath through constant shaking. An instant
color change from yellow to black was observed. After adding all of
the NaBH4 solution, the reaction mixture was shaken for
another 30 min and left for 24 h. After 24 h, the supernatant was
decanted, leaving the solid inside the container, using a strong magnet.
The black solid was washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water and then
with ethanol. To dry it completely, the black solid was then kept
in a vacuum oven at 65 °C. The obtained grayish-black solid was
crushed with a mortar and pestle to obtain the Fe–MM.

4.3 Analytical Techniques for Physical and Chemical
Characterization
4.3.1 Production and Exposure
of Ozone
An ozone generator (Yanco Industries Ltd.) was used
to obtain O3 by flowing O2 with a flow rate
of ∼60 mL/min
to create O3 with a concentration of ∼46 000 ppm/mL.
O3 was bubbled slowly (one bubble/3 s) in 10 mL of 100
mg/L solution of BG with 1 mg of Fe–MM for 30 s and two parts
of it were made. One was aged in the dark and the other under UV A
light for 30 min. Subsequently, the absorbance of BG in solution was
measured (after centrifugation) by employing a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Cary 50 Bio).

We also treated two sets of solid 1 mg Fe–MM
with 100 ppb O3 in three-neck gas-tight containers for
30 min, one in the dark and another with UV A light. Then, the BG
adsorption experiment was performed. The concentration of ozone (100
ppb) was calculated by employing a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Cary 50 Bio).

4.3.2 Exposure of NO2 Gas
A solution of BG (10 mL, 100 mg/L) with 1 mg of Fe–MM
was
bubbled with NO2 gas (60 mL/min) for 10 s from an NO2 cylinder (TC-3ALM-139/Dot 3AL). It was divided into two parts
and one was aged in the dark and the other under UV A light for 30
min. Then, the absorbance of BG was measured (after centrifugation)
by employing a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary 50 Bio).

We also treated two sets of solid 1 mg Fe–MM with NO2 gas (60 mL/min) for 3 s in a three-neck gas-tight container and
aged them for 30 min, one in the dark and another with UV A light.
The adsorption experiment was subsequently performed.

4.3.3 XRD Spectroscopy
XRD was recorded
with a Siemens D500 X-ray diffractometer (Co source, λ = 1.79
Å). XRD patterns were recorded for 10° ≤ 2θ
≤ 90°. The samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature
at 20 psi before taking the measurements.

4.3.4 X-ray
Photo Electron Spectroscopy
XPS measurements were carried
out with the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha
XPS. The samples were loaded onto a carbon tape to be placed on a
grid for the analysis. Samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature
before measurement.

4.3.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Particle
morphology was examined using a FEI Helios NanoLab 660 DualBeam (focused
ion beam) extreme high-resolution scanning electron microscope. The
microscope contains Leica Microsystems EM VCT100 cryo-transfer system,
MultiChem gas injection system, and EDAX Octane Ultra 100 mm2 SDD, and TEAM 3D EDS analysis system. Samples were vacuum-dried
at room temperature before measurement. The samples were put on a
carbon tape before SEM analyses.

4.3.6 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature
before measurement.
The samples were put on a carbon tape before TEM analyses. Then, 20
mg of each sample was dispersed in 4 mL of Milli-Q water. Then, 10
μL of each sample solution was deposited on glow-discharged
carbon film-coated copper electron microscopy grids and dried. The
samples were imaged using a FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin TEM microscope (FEI
Electron Optics) equipped with a tungsten filament at 120 kV, containing
an AMT XR80C CCD camera system.
