Positron emission
tomography (PET) is a sensitive modality for
cancer molecular imaging. We aim to develop a PET probe for sensitive
detection and risk stratification of prostate cancer by targeting
an abundant microenvironment oncoprotein, extradomain-B fibronectin
(EDB-FN). The probe consists of a small ZD2 peptide specific to EDB-FN
and a 64Cu-DOTA chelate. The probe was synthesized using
standard solid-phase peptide chemistry and chelated to 64Cu prior to imaging. PET images were acquired at 4 and 22 h after
intravenously injecting a 200 μCi probe into mice bearing human
PC3 and LNCaP tumors, which represent highly aggressive and slow-growing
prostate tumors, respectively. At 4 and 22 h postinjection, tumors
could be clearly identified in the PET images. A significant higher
signal was observed in PC3 tumors than in LNCaP tumors at 22 h (p = 0.01). Probe accumulation was also higher in PC3 tumors
at 24 h. These data demonstrated that PET molecular imaging of EDB-FN
in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer allows efficient
differentiation of PC3 and LNCaP tumors in vivo. The ZD2 peptide-targeted
PET probe shows potential in the detection and characterization of
high-risk prostate cancer to improve the clinical management of prostate
cancer.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is a prevalent disease
with a high heterogenicity
in men over 50 years of age. The current diagnostic approaches for
prostate cancer, such as prostate-specific antigen screening, have
a high false-positive rate, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.1 A noninvasive approach that can accurately detect
prostate cancer and stratify the risk of the disease is highly valuable
for tailoring precision therapies for patients who need immediate
intervention and spare those with low-risk tumors. Positron emission
tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive molecular imaging modality
routinely used in clinical management of cancer. The development of
PET probes has mostly been focused on targeting the markers associated
with overexpressed cell receptors2 and
elevated metabolisms.3,4 However, the expression levels
of these markers are subject to change during disease progression,
and a single biomarker cannot always suffice for cancer diagnosis
because of cancer heterogeneity.5 Tumor
microenvironment plays a critical role in the outgrowth, migration,
and metastasis of aggressive tumors.6 The
tumor microenvironment biomarkers, including angiogenesis, hypoxia,
acidic pH, extracellular matrix (ECM), and so forth, are critical
determinants of tumor aggressiveness regardless of the heterogeneity
of cancer cells.7 Molecular imaging of
these tumor microenvironment biomarkers could be a promising approach
for accurate detection and characterization of aggressive cancers,
including prostate cancer.7,8

Among the ECM
proteins, extradomain-B fibronectin (EDB-FN) is considered
as one of the most cancer-selective proteins with negligible expression
in normal adult tissues.9 The upregulation
of oncofetal fibronectin, including EDB-FN, is an important hallmark
of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).10,11 EMT plays an important role in the invasion, metastasis, and drug
resistance of many malignant human cancer types, including prostate
cancer.12 It has been demonstrated clinically
that EDB-FN is highly expressed in high-risk prostate cancer, but
lowly expressed in benign lesions and benign prostatic hyperplasia.13−16 Further, EDB-FN expression is inversely correlated with patient
survival.10,17−19 Therefore, EDB-FN is
a promising molecular imaging target for early detection and risk
stratification of prostate tumors.

We have recently developed
targeted magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) contrast agents specific to EDB-FN and demonstrated the potential
of molecular imaging of the ECM protein for cancer detection and risk
stratification in mouse models of breast and prostate cancer.20−24 These contrast agents were constructed by conjugating a small-peptide
ZD2 (Thr-Val-Arg-Thr-Ser-Ala-Asp) to gadolinium chelates and a gadofullerene.
As compared to antibody-labelled probes, the small-peptide-targeted
imaging agents possess the advantages of better tumor-penetrating
ability and minimal background noise because of rapid clearance of
unbound agents from the circulation for clear delineation of aggressive
tumors. The development of ZD2-targeted PET probes has the potential
for highly sensitive and quantitative molecular imaging of EDB-FN
for accurate detection and risk stratification of aggressive tumors.

Herein, we aim to develop a ZD2 64Cu-DOTA conjugate
as a PET probe for EDB-FN and evaluate its efficacy for PET imaging
in mice bearing aggressive PC3 and slow-growing LNCaP human prostate
tumor xenografts. Previously, we showed that EDB-FN was highly expressed
in aggressive PC3 tumors and negligibly expressed in slow-growing
and nonmetastatic LNCaP tumors.20 MRI with
a EDB-FN targeted contrast agent ZD2-Gd(HP-DO3A) showed stronger contrast
enhancement in the PC3 tumors than in the LNCaP tumors.20 The use of 64Cu is particularly attractive
because of its 12.74 h half-life, providing extended imaging time
frame for cancer detection in the prostate with minimal background
inference, especially from the bladder. The PET probe was synthesized
by conjugating the ZD2 peptide to a macrocyclic ligand, DOTA, followed
by complexation with 64CuCl2. The ability of
the PET probe in cancer detection and characterization of tumor aggressiveness
was evaluated in mice bearing PC3 and LNCaP tumors.

Results
The ZD2 64Cu-DOTA conjugate was synthesized by conjugating
ZD2 peptide to a macrocyclic chelate DOTA using solid-phase peptide
chemistry, followed by complexation with 64CuCl2 (Figure 1). A short
spacer with two repeats of 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid was introduced
between the peptide and the chelator. The targeted ligand ZD2-DA-DOTA
was purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry [m/z = 1425.8 (M + 1), observed; 1425.5, calculated]. The preparation
of the targeted PET probe was demonstrated by complexation of equal
molar ZD2-DA-DOTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4)
and cold CuCl2 in dilute HCl (0.1 N) at 45 °C for
30 min, the same condition used for radiolabeling. The formation of
ZD2-DA-(Cu-DOTA) was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry [m/z = 1487.8 (M + 1), observed; 1486.04,
calculated].

The efficacy of ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA) for
prostate cancer
PET imaging was then investigated in male nude mice bearing both PC3
and LNCaP human prostate cancer xenografts. Previously, we showed
that EDB-FN was highly expressed in aggressive PC3 tumors and negligibly
expressed in slow-growing and nonmetastatic LNCaP tumors.20 The tumor models were used to represent high-risk
and low-risk prostate tumors and to test the ability of the probe
to detect and stratify aggressive prostate cancer. Radiolabeling was
performed by mixing 20 μL of 64Cu(II) solution (0.1
N HCl, ca. 1 mCi or 37 MBq) with 480 μL of ZD2-DA-DOTA (0.05
mg/mL, a large excess, PBS, pH = 7.4) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube and was maintained at 45 °C for 30 min with intermittent
shaking. The reaction mixture was then diluted in the ratio of 1:2
with PBS and tested with a pH paper to ensure neutral pH for intravenous
injection. The radiotracer was injected intravenously at the dose
of 7.4 MBq (200 μCi) per mouse. PET images of the mice were
acquired in a group of four mice bearing both PC3 and LNCaP tumor
xenografts at 4 and 22 h after the injection.

Figure 2 shows the
representative three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering and axial PET/computed
tomography (CT) images of two tumor-bearing mice at 4 and 22 h after
injection of ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA). Stronger signal was visible
in the aggressive PC3 tumors than in the slow-growing LNCaP tumors.
The location and size of PC3 tumors were clearly delineated in the
PET images. The tracer uptake or signal intensity was quantitatively
analyzed in the region of interest (ROI) at 4 and 22 h. As shown in Figure 3, ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA) resulted in higher probe uptake in PC3 tumors than in LNCaP
tumors. At 22 h, PET revealed an over two-folds higher accumulation
of PET tracer in highly aggressive PC3 tumors (7711 ± 1994 Bq/mL)
compared to the less aggressive LNCaP tumors (3213 ± 1511 Bq/mL)
(N = 4, P < 0.05, two-tailed
Student’s t test). Other organs that demonstrated
substantial radiotracer uptake were liver, stomach, and kidney, indicating
the clearance of the radiotracer through hepatic and renal pathways.

h after injection of ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA).

Figure 3 Quantitative tracer uptake in the muscle, liver, heart,
and LNCaP
and PC3 tumors at 4 and 22 h after ZD2-DA-64Cu(DOTA) injection
(N = 4).

The biodistribution of the radiotracer was measured after
euthanizing
the mice at 24 h postinjection (Figure 4. The biodistribution pattern was consistent with the
findings in PET imaging, with a strong uptake in the tumors, liver,
and kidney. Other organs, such as brain and muscle, exhibited a low
radiotracer uptake, which is a desirable property of the radiotracer.
Comparison of the radiotracer uptake in PC3 and LNCaP tumors indicated
that the radiotracer accumulation in PC3 (1.64 ID %/g) is higher than
that in the LNCaP tumor (0.86 ID %/g) (N = 3, P = 0.32, two-tailed Student’s t test), which corroborated that the probe preferentially accumulates
in the more aggressive PC3 tumor than in the nonmetastatic LNCaP tumor.

of ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA) in different tissues
at 24 h after injection. Data is presented as mean ± sem (N = 3).

The expression of EDB-FN
in the prostate tumors was determined
by immunofluorescence staining of the tissue section of PC3 and LNCaP
tumors with an anti-EDB-FN monoclonal antibody BC1 after PET imaging.
An Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used to stain
the BC1 antibody and EDB-FN. Figure 5 shows the fluorescence images of the tumor sections
acquired with an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope.
Strong fluorescence staining was visible in the PC3 tumor section,
whereas little staining was observed in the LNCaP tumor. Consistently,
we have previously shown that the EDB mRNA level in LNCaP cells was
lower than that in PC3 cells.20 The EDB-FN
expression levels in two different prostate tumors correlated well
with the observation with PET molecular imaging. The result suggests
that ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA) is effective for sensitive and
quantitative visualization of EDB-FN expression in prostate cancer.

Discussions
PET imaging has been
applied in the clinical examination of prostate
cancer mainly with [18F]-FDG, based on elevated glucose
metabolism of prostate cancer compared to that of normal tissues.
However, [18F]-FDG PET has not demonstrated the ability
to differentiate benign prostate cancer from aggressive ones.25 PSMA-specific PET probes have recently been
developed for prostate cancer. Clinical studies have demonstrated
the ability of the PSMA probes for effective detection of PSMA-positive
prostate tumors.26 However, a recent study
cautioned that the PSMA probes may not be able to differentiate benign
tissues from prostate cancer.27 Novel PET
probes are needed to detect and risk-stratify aggressive prostate
cancer to meet the clinical need of a noninvasive diagnostic modality
for precision clinical management of prostate cancer.

We have
shown in this study the potential of PET imaging of the
ECM oncoprotein EDB-FN with a peptide probe ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA)
for detection and characterization of prostate cancer. Previously,
we have shown that EDB-FN is highly expressed in the fast-growing
PC3 tumors and lowly expressed in the slow-growing LNCaP tumors.20 ZD2 peptide-targeted MRI contrast agents were
able to generate strong signal enhancement in PC3 tumors than in LNCaP
tumors.20 The results of PET molecular
imaging EDB-FN with ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA), especially at 22
h postinjection, are in agreement with MR molecular imaging with a
ZD2 peptide-targeted MRI contrast agent. When comparing the probe
uptake in the tumors, stronger PET signals were detected in the fast-growing
PC3 tumors with a high EDB-FN expression than in the slow-growing
LNCaP tumors. However, a significant signal intensity was still observed
in the LNCaP tumors of the PET images. This could be attributed to
the relatively low chelation stability of 64Cu-DOTA monoamide.
It has been shown that free 64Cu(II) released from the
chelate could accumulate in the prostate tumors in animal models.28 The relatively high signal intensity in the
LNCaP tumors could be attributed to the accumulation of free 64Cu(II) released from the probe.29 Nevertheless, the targeting effect of the ZD2 peptide of the probe
still resulted in significantly higher signal intensity in the PC3
tumors than in the LNCaP tumors. As compared to MR molecular imaging,
PET imaging produces sensitive and quantitative visualization and
measurement of EDB-FN expression levels in prostate cancer, which
could provide more accurate risk stratification of aggressive prostate
cancer.

Generally, PET imaging with probes of relatively short
half-lives
suffers from significant signal inference from the bladder for imaging
primary tumors in the prostate because of a limited imaging window.
The relatively long half-life 64Cu allows sufficient time
to empty the bladder and to minimize the potential signal interference
from the bladder, which is critical for early detection of primary
tumors in the prostate. Substantial signals were still visible in
tumors at 22 h postinjection with little signals in the bladder. Significant
signal intensity was observed in the liver with ZD2-DA-(64Cu-DOTA), which could also be attributed to the relatively low stability
of Cu-DOTA monoamide. The release of free 64Cu(II) from
the chelate may lead to nonspecific accumulation of the radioisotope
in the liver.

Antibodies and antibody fragments have been developed
to target
EDB-FN for the detection of cancer, including prostate cancer. A recent
clinical study has shown that an antibody-labelled PET probe, 131I-L19-SIP, specific to EDB-FN was effective for imaging
advanced prostate cancer with PET, suggesting that EDB-FN is a promising
molecular marker for clinical PET imaging of prostate cancer.30 This study has shown that the small-peptide-targeted
PET probe specific to EDB-FN also has the potential for prostate cancer
imaging. As compared to antibody-based probes, small-peptide PET probes
may possess several advantages, including cost-effective production,
better tumor penetration through diffusion and perfusion, and rapid
excretion of the unbound probe from circulation.

Further optimization
is needed to improve the stability of ZD2-targeted
PET probes. We will choose ligands that form stable complexes with 64Cu(II), which will minimize the release of free 64Cu(II) ions and the consequent nonspecific tissue uptake. The clinically
used radioisotopes, for example, 68Ga, will be used to
develop the ZD2-targeted PET probe for sensitive detection and risk
stratification of prostate cancer. The specific overexpression of
EDB-FN has also been reported in a number of human cancers, including
melanoma,31 breast cancer,32 glioma,33 head and neck cancer,34 and so forth. An optimized ZD2 peptide-targeted
PET probe has the potential to be used for imaging of a broad spectrum
of human cancers. Currently, we are working on the optimization of
ZD2-targeted PET probes and testing the ability of the probes for
imaging other types of cancer.

Conclusions
A small-peptide-targeted
PET probe, ZD2-DA-64Cu(DOTA),
specific to EDB-FN was synthesized and tested for prostate cancer
imaging. The probe was effective in detecting prostate tumors and
exhibited higher uptake in high-risk prostate tumors with a high EDB-FN
expression than in low-risk tumors in animal models. The results suggest
that ZD2-targeted PET probes have the promise for sensitive detection
and characterization of prostate cancer. Optimizations of the targeted
probe are needed to improve the chelation stability of the radioisotope
and the ligand to minimize the nonspecific uptake in a normal tissue
and to further improve its accuracy for quantitative determination
of the EDB-FN expression and risk stratification of aggressive prostate
cancer. The high sensitivity of PET and specific detection and characterization
of the targeted probe provide another toolset for prostate cancer
diagnosis and precision management of the disease.

Materials and
Methods
Synthesis of ZD2-DA-DOTA and Chelates
The reagents
used for chemical synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint
Louis, MO, USA), unless otherwise stated. Fmoc-protected amino acids
and 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin were acquired from Chem-Impex International,
Inc. (Wood Dale, IL). The spacer, Fmoc-8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid
(Fmoc–NH–(CH2CH2O)2–CH2COOH), was acquired from Chempep (Wellington,
FL). 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tris-tert-butyl acetate-10-acetic acid (DOTA-tris(t-Bu))
was purchased from TCI America (Portland, OR).

The precursor
ZD2-DA-DOTA, which contains the ZD2 peptide (sequence: TVRTSAD), two
repeats of NH2–(CH2CH2O)2–CH2COOH, and DOTA was synthesized by sequentially
adding the corresponding protected amino acids, Fmoc–NH–(CH2CH2O)2–CH2COOH, and t-Bu-DOTA on the resin in a solid phase using standard Fmoc-peptide
chemistry.21 The product was then cleaved
off the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropyl silane/H2O (96.5:1:2.5) and stirred at room temperature for 3 h and
precipitated in ether to give a crude product. The final product was
purified using preparative HPLC on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped
with a semipreparative C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA). ZD2-DA-DOTA was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
on a Voyager DE-STR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) in the
linear mode with R 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix (M + 1: 1425.8,
observed; 1425.7, calculated).

Cell Culture and Animal
Models
The animal study has
been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and all subjects signed
an informed consent form. PC3 and LNCaP cells were acquired from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin in a humid incubator maintained at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. Male athymic nude mice (4–6 weeks old)
were acquired from the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Cleveland,
OH, USA) and housed in the CWRU Animal Core Facility. Three million
cells in high concentration Matrigel (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) were
used for tumor inoculation. LNCaP cells were subcutaneously inoculated
in the left flank of the mice. Four weeks later, PC3 cells were inoculated
on the right flank of the same mice for PET imaging.

Radiolabeling
The radioisotope 64Cu(II)
was acquired from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (Madison,
WI). The chelation of ZD2-DA-DOTA with Cu(II) was first tested with
cold CuCl2 in 0.1 N HCl aqueous solution under the same
condition as radiolabeling. Equal molar ZD2-DA-DOTA in PBS buffer
(pH 7.4) and CuCl2 solution was mixed and stirred at 45
°C for 30 min. The formation of ZD2-DA-(Cu-DOTA) was verified
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (M + 1: 1487.8, observed; 1486.04,
calculated). For radiolabeling, 10 mCi 64Cu(II) was dissolved in 200 μL of
0.1 N HCl. Twenty microliters of 64Cu(II) solution (ca.
1 mCi) was mixed with 480 μL of ZD2-DA-DOTA (0.05 mg/mL, a large
excess, PBS) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The vessel was then
maintained by heating at 45 °C for 30 min with intermittent shaking.
The final pH of the solution was adjusted to be neutral using NaOH
solution before injection.

PET Imaging
All in vivo imaging
studies were conducted
according to the CWRU Animal Research Committee-approved protocols
and guidelines. The mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen
and injected with ∼200 μCi [∼7.4 MBq] ZD2-DA-64Cu(DOTA) via the tail vein. The mice underwent 10 min static
PET scans after 4 and 22 h uptake period PET scans (Inveon microPET,
Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc.). Images were reconstructed using
3D-OSEM with 3D histogramming and a zoom factor of 1.0 (two iterations
followed by MAP with 18 iterations). CT scans (Siemens Medical Solutions
USA Inc.) were performed after PET procedures for anatomical coregistration.
AMIDE version 1.0.557 and AMIRA software were used to analyze the
PET/CT images g. ROIs were drawn for PC3 and LNCaP tumors to calculate
the ratio of specific to nonspecific (muscle) binding.

Biodistribution
After the last micro-PET/CT imaging
at 22 h postinjection, three mice were euthanized, the organs and
blood were collected and weighed, and the activity was determined
in a gamma counter. The percent-injected dose per gram of tissue was
calculated using a standard containing 2% of the injected dose.

Histological Analysis
After image acquisitions, the
mice were euthanized. The tumors were harvested, embedded in an optimal
cutting temperature medium, frozen in −80 °C, cryosectioned
at 5 μm, and permeabilized with cold acetone. The tissue was
blocked with bovine serum albumin (1%) in PBS at room temperature
for 1 h. Anti-EDB-FN BC1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was incubated
with the tissue section of PC3 and LNCaP tumors. After extensive washing,
secondary anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody was incubated for 1
h. Tissue sections were counterstained with Prolong Gold antifade
mounting medium with 4′ 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Thermo
Fisher, Waltham, MA). The stained tissues were imaged on an Olympus
FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope.
