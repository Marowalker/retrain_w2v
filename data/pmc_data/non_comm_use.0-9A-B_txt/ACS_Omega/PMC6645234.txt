The objective of this study, the
first of its kind on these specific
South African low-sulfur coals, was to capture H2S and
SO2 produced under inert and oxidizing conditions from
sulfur compounds present in the coals. The capturing agents were calcium
and magnesium oxides formed during the transformation of calcite and
dolomite. The effectiveness of two different scrubbing solutions (0.15
M cadmium acetate and 1.1 M potassium hydroxide) for absorption of
volatilized H2S and SO2 was also investigated.
The bituminous coal (coal A) contained dolomite, calcite, pyrite,
and organic sulfur. Lignite (coal B) had a high organic sulfur content
and contained gypsum, no or low dolomite and pyrite contents, and
no calcite. A third sample (coal C) was prepared by adding 5 wt %
potassium carbonate to coal A. Under oxidizing conditions and at elevated
temperatures, FeS2 produced Fe2O3, FeO, and SO2. It transformed to FeS and released H2S under inert conditions. Organic sulfur interacted with organically
bound calcium and magnesium at 400 °C in an inert atmosphere
to form calcium sulfate and oldhamite ((Ca,Mg)S). CaO, produced from
calcite or dolomite, reacted with SO2 and O2 at 950 °C to form calcium sulfate. Treatment of lignite at
400–950 °C resulted in 96–98% evolution of sulfur
as gases. Hydrogen sulfide formation increased with the increasing
thermal treatment temperature under inert conditions for the three
coals. Under oxidizing conditions, sulfur dioxide formation decreased
with the increasing temperature when heating coals B and C. The lowest
ratio (0.01) of H2S to SO2 was achieved during
thermal treatment of the blend of coal and potassium carbonate (coal
C), implying that almost all of sulfur was retained in the coal C
ash/char samples. In situ capturing of sulfur gases by CaO and MgO
and by the added K2CO3 in coal C to form calcium/magnesium/potassium
sulfates and potassium/calcium/magnesium aluminosilicate glasses during
utilization of these and similar coals could reduce the percentage
of sulfur volatilized from the coals by 54–100%, thereby potentially
decreasing their impact on the environment.

==== Body
Introduction
The inorganic portion of coals consists
effectively of two fractions:
(1) a range of discrete crystalline mineral particles (i.e., mineral
matter) occurring in the coal in different ways and, especially, in
low-rank coals and (2) a range of nonmineral inorganic elements dissolved
in water in pores or intimately associated with the organic matter.1,2 All coals contain sulfur in different forms (pyrite, sulfate, and
organic sulfur) varying between 0.2 and 11%.3,8−10 During heating, as in combustion or gasification
processes, the minerals originally present in the coal undergo various
transformations. Examples of such transformations include, among others,
conversion of carbonates to oxides and formation of gaseous sulfur
species.11−15 Transformations of organic sulfur and sulfur-bearing minerals have
been investigated under both reducing/inert and oxidizing conditions
and have been reported extensively.16−19 While various commercially available
coal-cleaning operations can effectively reduce the amount of pyritic
sulfur in coals, these operations do not remove organic sulfur. The
organic sulfur present in coal is likely to be an issue with regard
to potential air pollution and material corrosion during coal utilization.13,14,20−22

Pyrite
can decompose in different ways depending on the atmosphere,
with the transformation processes and products dependent on the temperature,
oxygen concentration, flow rates, and particle size.3 Pyrite undergoes oxidation reactions to form iron oxides
such as hematite, maghemite, and magnetite; ferric and ferrous sulfate;
and sulfur dioxide during coal combustion.11−15,10,19,23,24 Depending on the concentration of oxygen, the transformation of
pyrite can occur in two ways: through either the direct oxidation
of pyrite or a two-step process, which first involves thermal decomposition
in an inert atmosphere to form pyrrhotite, followed by oxidation of
the pyrrhotite.24 Reactions that occur
during the oxidation of pyrite and decomposition of iron sulfate when
using different concentrations of oxygen can be described by the following
equations.3 1   2   3   4   5   6  Lime, which is derived from
thermal decomposition of calcite and dolomite, and also from nonmineral
Ca associated with organic matter, can interact with or capture SO2 and SO3 released from the transformations of the
organic sulfur and sulfur-bearing minerals to form anhydrite (CaSO4).25,26

Under an inert atmosphere
(e.g., during pyrolysis) or under reducing
conditions, pyrite can react at temperatures between 300 and 600 °C
to form pyrrhotite (Fe(1–x)S) and
reactive sulfur.3,27,28 This reactive sulfur can react with hydrogen from coal to form hydrogen
sulfide.

Sulfur-containing gases pollute the environment and
may also deactivate
catalysts used in reactions of gases derived from coal, such as the
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.29 It
is thus important to understand the transformation of sulfur compounds
during heat treatment of coal and lignite. Such studies can provide
insight to reduce sulfur emission during combustion, gasification,
and pyrolysis.

The preponderance of chemical studies on bituminous
coals have
been carried out with bituminous coals of the northern hemisphere,
which were deposited during the Carboniferous era. South African bituminous
coals are of Permian age. The kinds of plants that dominated the palaeoflora
of the Permian are different from those of the Carboniferous. In addition,
the environments of accumulation of plant matter and its initial transformations
to coal were likely different. Therefore, one aspect of this study
sheds insight into the sulfur chemistry of South African bituminous
coals, which are geologically younger than the far more extensively
studied northern hemisphere coals. In addition, when studying a particular
kind of coal, such as bituminous, it can be insightful to compare
a coal of different rank, as was done in this study by including a
South African lignite.

Several relatively recent papers in the
literature have also reported
the use of K2CO3 and/or Ca(OH)2 additives
in reactions of coal.35,46,49,50 However, those papers concentrate on the
use of these added compounds as catalysts for gasification and pyrolysis
and discuss recovering and reusing these materials. This article is
much different from these other recent studies in that the authors
used added potassium carbonate as a sorbent for in situ sulfur capture,
not as a catalyst, and that the authors neither address nor contemplate
recovery and recycling of the additives.

Sulfur analyses of
other South African coals from Highveld mines
show that the total sulfur content varies between 0.2 and 11%.3,8−10 The present work was the first study of its kind
on these specific low-sulfur South African coals. The primary objective
of this study was to investigate the transformations of sulfur-bearing
minerals and organic sulfur in the two selected coals at elevated
temperatures under inert and oxidizing conditions. The two coals were
a bituminous coal of 1.13–1.26% sulfur (air-dried basis) and
lignite of 0.98% sulfur, in which the majority of the sulfur is present
as organic sulfur. In addition, the lignite ash has a higher concentration
of alkali elements than does the bituminous coal ash, as discussed
below in the Results and Discussion section.
To probe the possibility that any significant differences in in situ
capturing could be due to the alkali elements, a third sample was
prepared by doping the bituminous coal with 5% of potassium carbonate.

The secondary objective was to test the effectiveness of two different
scrubbing solutions (0.15 M cadmium acetate dihydrate and 1.1 M potassium
hydroxide solutions) for absorption of volatilized H2S
and SO2. The absorption of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur
dioxide gases using cadmium acetate solutions has not previously been
studied in detail during reactions of these South African coals. Cadmium
acetate is well known to be useful in the analysis of H2S in the offgas released from conversion and combustion processes
of other kinds of coals.7,53−55

Evaluation of mineral matter by quantitative X-ray diffraction
and chemical analyses of the coal samples were used to determine sulfur
contents, as well as the proportions of sulfur-bearing mineral matter
and minerals that are responsible for the in situ capturing of potentially
polluting sulfur gases. The study also includes comparisons with data
from other analytical techniques, partly to check and confirm the
accuracy of the results obtained in this study. The use of such information
in understanding the transformation of sulfur-bearing mineral matter
in the South African coals and a subsequent sulfur in situ capturing
during thermochemical processes are also included in the discussion.
The industrial implementation of the results obtained in this study
could reduce emission of environmentally harmful sulfur gases (Table 1).

Table 1 shows the
concentrations of the different forms of sulfur in the three samples.
Pyritic sulfur and mineral sulfur are dominant in coals A and C. The
pyritic sulfur content in coal B is negligible (0.03%), but coal B
is richer in organic sulfur than the other samples.

Coal A and
coal B contained the same percentage of sulfatic sulfur
lower than that in coal C. This is consistent with the fact that sulfates
are minor constituents of the mineral matter of most coals likely
arising from oxidation of sulfides.30 Although
we did not determine the sulfur functional groups in these samples,
there seems to be a consensus in the literature that the organic sulfur
present in lignites (such as coal B) could be attributed to significant
amounts of thiol and disulfide structures, whereas substantial amounts
of thiophenic structures are present in higher-rank coals.9,44,45,52 Similar forms of sulfur were found to be present in other coals
when using sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)44,45 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)46,52 analyses. In addition, the presence of organic sulfur has been noted
in the macerals of South African coals,30 based on more detailed electron microprobe studies using quantitative
element mapping (Table 1).

Char and Ash Chemistry
Tables 5 and 6 show the differences
in the XRF results for char and ash samples produced from the heat
treatment of the different coal samples under an inert atmosphere
(Table 5) and air (Table 6). The concentrations
of phosphorus present in the char samples slightly differed. This,
and the slight differences in potassium and iron concentrations in
other char and ash samples, could be due to the uncertainty of XRF
analysis (±1% for both K and Fe with this instrument) and also
to the mass loss of coal and lignite during thermal treatment. The
XRF results for the char and ash samples compare favorably to those
of the ashes of coals (Table 4), excluding the sulfur results.

The
proportions of inorganic elements in the ash samples, derived
from XRF analysis and reported in the traditional oxide form, are
given in Table 4. The
XRF results of the ash derived from coal A are slightly different
from the XRF results for the ash sample prepared from the blend of
coal A and potassium carbonate (i.e., coal C). The three ashes displayed
similar base-to-acid ratios of ≈0.3. These XRF results for
the coals evaluated in this study are in good agreement with previous
XRF results for other South African coals.11,13,14

Silicon and aluminum are the dominant
elements in the ashes, with
lesser but still significant proportions of calcium, iron, magnesium,
potassium, sulfur, and titanium. Lignite ash contains higher concentrations
of Na2O relative to the ashes of coals A and C, which contained
no detectable sodium. (The detection limit for sodium with this XRF
instrument is 0.03%, and the uncertainty when determining the concentration
of sodium in solid samples is 1%.) The minor elements Mn, Cr, V, Ba,
Zr, Sr, and Zn, reported as oxides, made up ≤0.95% of the ash
samples. On the basis of the SO3 contents in Table 4, the ash of coal A contained
7.63% sulfur reported as SO3 and coal B ash contained 8.09%
SO3.

The extent of sulfur retention in the ash samples
depends partly
on the ashing conditions (e.g., heating rate) and partly on the proportion
of elements such as Ca, Mg, Na, and K that are available to combine
with the gaseous sulfur species released during ash preparation. Because
the heating rates used for ashing were the same for all three samples,
ashing conditions can be eliminated as a variable that would affect
sulfur retention so that ash chemistry is the main consideration affecting
the observed results. The ashes from coals A and B contain a large
molar excess of CaO and MgO relative to the amount of SO3 reported in the ash. If CaO and MgO do not react with metakaolinite
from dehydration of kaolinite at elevated temperatures (≤950
°C), there is more than enough Ca and Mg in these ashes to account
for capturing all of the sulfur. The presence of feldspars (Table 9) such as anorthite
and of amorphous material (calcium aluminosilicates) in the chars
and ash samples produced at 950 °C implies that some CaO from
the transformations of dolomite and calcite and organic Ca reacted
with metakaolinite.13,14

The char and ash samples
contained low concentrations of sulfur
when compared with the parent coal samples, (Tables 4–6). Clearly,
most of the sulfur has been released, presumably as SO2 and/or H2S (Tables 4–6). More sulfur gases
were released under both atmospheric conditions at the higher temperatures.
Even coals that would be very attractive for utilization based on
daf sulfur contents <2% can still release much of that sulfur as
gaseous compounds. Low concentrations of sulfur in char and ash samples
show that most of the sulfur originally present in the coal can be
released under conditions used in our experiments. Depending on prevailing
environmental regulations, this potential sulfur emission would still
need to be addressed (Figure 1).

Mineralogy for Coals (A–C) and Char and Ash Samples
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Table 7, Figure 4) revealed that lignite contained no calcite and pyrite,
in comparison with the bituminous coal samples (Table 7, Figure 2, and Figure 3). XRD detected low concentrations of gypsum in lignite but
not in the other samples.13 The presence
of gypsum could account for the sulfate sulfur in lignite. Minor amounts
of pyrite, calcite, and dolomite were found in the bituminous coal
and bituminous coal + K2CO3 blend samples (Table 7 and Figures 2 and 3). Other minerals that are present in the coals (Figures 2–4) are not discussed in
detail.

Traces of hematite (Fe2O3) and
wuestite (FeO)
are found in some of the ash samples produced at 400 and 950 °C
under oxidizing conditions, most likely produced by the oxidation
of pyrite (Table 9).
Trace amounts of pyrite are still present in char and ash samples
produced under both inert and oxidizing conditions, due to organic
carbon matrix inhibiting the transformations of minerals.13,15 Pyrite present in the coal undergoes extensive oxidation at elevated
temperatures to form iron oxide (hematite) and sulfur dioxide during
heat treatment.11−15,10,19,24,31,32

Oldhamite (Ca, MgS) also appears to be present
in the char and
ash samples (Tables 8 and 9). This mineral
was not found to be present in any of the samples A–C (Table 7 and Figures 2–4). Lime (CaO), which was formed during the interaction of organically
associated calcium, can react with sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide
at 400 °C to form oldhamite under inert conditions. Oldhamite
can survive at temperatures >950 °C.33,34 Carbon or carbon monoxide reduces calcium sulfate formed during
the interactions of organic sulfur and organically associated calcium
to form oldhamite at temperatures between 950 and 1500 °C during
pyrolysis of coal under inert atmospheres.43 The chemical reactions of oldhamite under an inert atmosphere are
as follows 7   8   9  Formation
of oldhamite is responsible for
high sulfur retention in the char and ash samples.

The concentration of anhydrite in the char and ash samples varied
between 0.6 and 6%. Anhydrite likely formed by interaction of SO2 gas, derived from the organic sulfur and pyrite, with a combination
of CaO released from carbonate minerals in the coal and nonmineral
Ca released from the organic matter during heat treatment under oxidizing
conditions.25 Formation of anhydrite is
primarily responsible for the retention of sulfur in the char and
ash samples. In addition, other researchers found that potassium carbonate
melt and potassium ions from the decomposition of K2CO3 at 891 °C react with organic sulfur and sulfur species
from transformation of pyrite at 900 °C to form potassium sulfate.35 Other potassium species react with metakaolinite
from transformation of kaolinite to form either potassium aluminosilicate
glass or potassium feldspar. This accounts for the high percentage
of sulfur retained in the ash of coal C produced in both inert and
oxidizing conditions. In a similar study, both calcium hydroxide and
potassium carbonate were added to coal to capture sulfur-bearing compounds
during pyrolysis and gasification.46 Sulfur
XANES analysis results indicated that sulfur was retained in the char
and ash samples as K2SO4 and not as CaSO4 and CaS. H2S and COS formed during the transformation
of pyrite and organic sulfur were released during pyrolysis and gasification.46 Ca(OH)2 added to coal could possibly
have reacted with the sulfur species differently than would calcium-bearing
minerals inherent in the coal during pyrolysis and gasification. Other
researchers found that the excluded minerals, i.e., discrete particles
of minerals in the coal, and included minerals, inherent minerals
associated within the carbonaceous matrix, react differently during
thermochemical processes.11,47

Gypsum was observed
to contribute up to 1.6% of the minerals to
these samples. Gypsum would not be expected to be present in the char
and ash treated at elevated temperatures under either atmosphere because
it loses water of hydration completely at about 165 °C. We attribute
its presence to the reaction of anhydrite with moisture at ambient
temperature during sample preparation. (In fact, anhydrite is sold
commercially under various trade names, such as Drierite, for use
as a dehydrating agent.)

The absence of lime from the analyses
shown in Tables 8 and 9 is attributed to several factors. There is a low
concentration of
calcite in these samples to begin with. Lime, formed during the decomposition
of calcite, dolomite, and organically associated Ca, could have reacted
with water vapor to form portlandite (Table 9) and also could have reacted with metakaolinite
during transformation of kaolinite at temperatures >900 °C
to
form anorthite.14,25 The small amount of periclase
(Tables 8 and 9) noted in the char and ash samples likely formed
by decomposition of dolomite or from nonmineral Mg in the organic
matter.

Absorption of H2S
All cadmium acetate scrubbers
formed a yellow precipitate of cadmium sulfide during both the pyrolysis
and combustion experiments. The precipitate was separated from the
aqueous phase via filtration after a few hours of storage at room
temperature. The total masses of the CdS precipitate that was formed
during heat treatment under both inert atmosphere and oxidizing conditions
were 10 and 540 mg, respectively (Table 10). The amorphous precipitates (Figure 8) were dried before
weighing and corrected for the mass of the filter paper. Hydrogen
sulfide evolved during the transformation of pyritic and organic sulfur9,10,19,36−39 at elevated temperatures, under both atmospheres, reacted with cadmium
acetate present in the scrubber solution samples to precipitate amorphous
yellow cadmium sulfide, CdS.7,53−55 These results obtained in this study are consistent with other work
on sulfur transformation at elevated temperatures to form H2S, COS, and SO2 during pyrolysis and gasification.44,45 The following possible reaction between pyrite and hydrogen from
the organic matter can take place at elevated temperatures (400–950
°C) to form hydrogen sulfide and pyrrhotite under inert conditions.9,10 10  The reaction
that then takes place is 11  The XRD and inductively
coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) results for the yellow precipitate samples clearly
confirmed that the purity of the amorphous samples (Figure 8) is 95% containing mainly
Cd (77%) and S (18%).

Hydrogen sulfide that was not absorbed
by cadmium acetate can react
with potassium ions and water present in the second scrubber solution
(potassium hydroxide solution) to form water-soluble potassium hydrogen
sulfide (KHS).40

IC Analyses
The
concentrations of SO2 gas
captured as SO42– by the scrubber solutions
(cadmium acetate and potassium hydroxide solutions) during pyrolysis
and combustion at 400 and 950 °C are presented in Table 10. Other cadmium and potassium
ions in the scrubbers could react with sulfate to form water-soluble
cadmium sulfate and potassium sulfate. Under both inert and oxidizing
conditions, the concentration of SO42– in the scrubber solution samples decreased with increasing temperature
for all three coal samples. The low concentrations of SO42– shown in Table 10 may correspond to the available free CaO from the
decomposition of calcite or dolomite during heat treatment. CaO can
react with sulfur oxide gases to form calcium sulfate. The in situ
capturing of the sulfur oxide gases during combustion resulted in
significant retention of sulfur in the ash and char.

The concentration
of sulfide anions in the scrubber solution samples from the experiments
was not determined during the IC analysis. As discussed above, cadmium
acetate solution captured hydrogen sulfide as a yellow precipitate
of cadmium sulfide. At ambient temperature, the solubility product
constant of cadmium sulfide is 3.6 × 10–29,
indicating that the sulfide ion concentration in these cadmium solutions
is negligible.

%SO3 Volatilized as SO2 during Thermal
Treatment of Coals
From the XRF analysis results (% ash composition),
the %SO3 was calculated using the formula  where A indicates
values
from Table 4, B indicates values from Table 5, C indicates values from Table 6, D indicates values from Table 13, and [ ] indicates the concentration of SO3.

The calculated results for %SO3 volatilized at
400 and 950 °C during thermal treatment experiments are given
in Tables 11 and 12. From these two tables, the trend of increasing
%SO3 volatilized with increasing temperature appears, for
all samples heated under both atmospheres. Coals that contained calcite
and dolomite (A and C) had a low degree of sulfur volatilization compared
with lignite (B), which contained no calcite. This implies that reactive
CaO from the transformation of calcite or from nonmineral calcium
can capture sulfur oxide gases to form inert calcium sulfates.13,15,25,36,38 The coal containing calcite, dolomite, and
added potassium carbonate (coal C) produced the lowest volatilization
of sulfur in both inert and oxidizing conditions (Tables 11 and 12).

The results for lignite are consistent with organic
sulfur being
the dominant sulfur form and with the findings in the literature that
much of this sulfur would be in the form of thiols and disulfides.
The C–S and S–S bonds are very weak and should readily
cleave during thermal treatment. This has been observed for pyrolysis
and liquefaction of Spanish Mequinenza lignite,51 which has unusually high organic sulfur content (Table 13).

Calculations of Masses of Some Volatilized
Hydrogen Sulfide
and Sulfur Dioxide Gases and Their Ratios
The masses of CdS
precipitates were used to calculate masses of volatilized hydrogen
sulfides. The concentrations of sulfate in the scrubber solutions
were used to calculate masses of sulfur dioxide evolved. The recorded
masses of the precipitates, calculated masses of hydrogen sulfide
and sulfur dioxide gases absorbed in the scrubber solutions, and their
calculated ratios are presented in Table 10 and Figures 5–7.

The masses of hydrogen sulfide
absorbed in the cadmium acetate
solutions increased with an increase in temperature during thermal
treatment under an inert atmosphere. In contrast, the masses of hydrogen
sulfide absorbed decrease with an increase in the temperature during
heating under oxidizing (air) conditions. These significant reductions
in the masses of the absorbed hydrogen sulfide when heating coals
at 950 °C under oxidizing conditions are likely due to the fact
that any H2S that does form becomes oxidized to SO2. The observed differences could also be attributed to an
in situ capturing of sulfur-containing gases by calcium species to
form calcium sulfates.25,38 The masses of hydrogen sulfide
absorbed in the cadmium acetate solution increases with an increase
in temperature during the thermal treatment of the calcite-free lignite
in air.

Due to the reaction between CaO and sulfur dioxide to
form calcium
sulfates,13−15 the masses of sulfur dioxide absorbed in the scrubber
solutions decreased with an increase in the temperature for experiments
in air (Figure 6).
The low masses of sulfur dioxide absorbed in the scrubber solutions
did not change significantly during thermal treatment under nitrogen.

Excluding samples NA4 and AA4, low ratios of H2S to
SO2 (Figure 7) were obtained after thermal treatment under
both atmospheres. The lowest ratio of H2S to SO2 was achieved after heating the blend of coal and potassium carbonate
(coal C) under oxidizing conditions. This suggests that almost >90%
of sulfur was retained in the ash and char samples containing anhydrite
and in potassium carbonate melt or potash aluminosilicate glasses
produced from coal C. Low masses of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide
and low H2S to SO2 ratios can be attributed
to reactions among hydrogen sulfide, potassium ions, and water to
form potassium hydrogen sulfide. Also, hydrogen sulfide can react
with carbon monoxide from decomposition of organic oxygen functional
groups to form COS.41,42,45

Summary of the Results for the Samples from Thermal Treatment
Experiments
The XRD analysis results indicated that low concentrations
of calcite
(0.7–2.5%) and pyrite (0.1–0.2%) were present in these
coals. The coals also contained organic sulfur (0.5–1%) and
mineral sulfur (0.02–0.03%). Lignite (coal B) contained 0.03%
pyritic sulfur and 1% organic sulfur. XRD results for the char and
ash samples indicated the presence of periclase (MgO), derived from
the decomposition of dolomite. In some instances, pyrite transformed
to wüstite and hematite at elevated temperatures. Calcium sulfate
and oldhamite were formed by reaction of organically associated calcium
or CaO released from calcite or dolomite, with sulfur-bearing gases
formed from decomposition of organic sulfur compounds and pyrite.
The formation of anhydrite (at 950 °C under air) and oldhamite
(at 400 °C under nitrogen) in the char and ash samples is responsible
for significant sulfur retention concentrations in the char and ash
samples (Tables 8 and 9).

Figure 8 Diffractogram
of amorphous CdS precipitate formed after the absorption
of H2S by Cd acetate solution during the laboratory thermal
treatment of coals.

Coals with relatively
high concentrations of CaO from calcite achieved
42–86% reductions of sulfur gas evolution. A 96–98%
sulfur volatilization was obtained from heat treatment of lignite
(coal B), which contained no calcite, at 400–950 °C in
air. Addition of potassium carbonate to the bituminous coal (coal
C) containing calcite and dolomite significantly enhanced the retention
of sulfur (72–100%) in the ash and char samples under both
inert and oxidizing conditions. These high percentages of sulfur retention
in the char and ash derived from coal C are attributed to the formation
of calcium sulfates, potassium sulfate, oldhamite, and potassium/calcium
aluminosilicate glasses (amorphous materials).

The masses of
hydrogen sulfide absorbed in the cadmium acetate
solutions to form an amorphous CdS precipitate (Figure 8) increased with the increasing temperature
during thermal treatment under nitrogen. However, hydrogen sulfide
formation decreased with an increase in temperature during heating
of samples B and C under oxidizing conditions, entirely consistent
with the expected oxidation of sulfur to its oxide. The mass of hydrogen
sulfide increases with an increase in temperature during thermal treatment
of the calcite-free lignite sample under oxidizing conditions.

The amount of sulfur dioxide decreased with an increase in the
temperature when heating samples B and C under the oxidizing condition.
The amount of sulfur dioxide absorbed, however, did not change significantly
during the thermal treatment of any of the coal samples under the
inert conditions.

The lowest ratio of H2S to SO2 was achieved
after heating the blend of coal and potassium carbonate (coal C) under
oxidizing conditions. Almost 100% of sulfur was retained in the ash/char
samples produced from coal C.

Conclusions
Integration of XRD,
XRF, proximate and ultimate analyses, IC, and
ICP-MS, forms of sulfur and gravimetric analyses, has provided a better
understanding the sulfur transformations and in situ capturing of
the released sulfur gases during the pyrolysis and combustion of a
selected South African low-sulfur bituminous coal and lignite. Most
of the sulfur originally in the coal can be released under conditions
used in our experiments.

Ashes produced in this study all had
similar base-to-acid ratios.
Therefore, the basicity or acidity of the ash and the effects of ashing
conditions can be eliminated as factors involved in sulfur retention.
Sulfur retention must depend upon interactions of sulfur species with
specific coal or ash components.

Coals that contained calcite
and dolomite (A and C) had a lower
degree of sulfur volatilization than that for lignite (coal B), which
contained no calcite. Reactive CaO can capture sulfur oxides to form
inert calcium sulfates. The coal containing calcite, dolomite, and
added potassium carbonate (coal C) produced the lowest volatilization
of sulfur in both inert and oxidizing conditions. This indicates an
additional benefit of relatively high potassium contents in ash.

Oldhamite, not found in any of the coals, appears in the chars
and ashes. Lime can react with sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide
at 400 °C to form oldhamite, which persists to temperatures of
>950 °C. This reaction contributes to high sulfur retention.

Under oxidizing conditions, formation of anhydrite is primarily
responsible for the retention of sulfur in the char and ash samples.
Almost 90% of sulfur was retained in the ash and char samples containing
anhydrite. For coal C, sulfur capture was augmented by the presence
of potassium carbonate melt or by potash aluminosilicate glasses.

The amount of sulfur dioxide evolved decreased with an increase
in temperature for coals B and C under oxidizing conditions. CaO captured
SO2 to form anhydrite in the ash or char.

Treatment
of lignite, which contained no calcite and no pyrite,
at 400–950 °C under inert and oxidizing conditions resulted
in 96–98% volatilization of sulfur gases, providing further
evidence for the importance of calcium as the primary sulfur-capturing
agent in these coals. Under inert conditions, almost all of the sulfur
in lignite volatilizes without being captured in the ash, even at
400 °C. This is consistent with organic sulfur being by far the
dominant sulfur form.

The amount of hydrogen sulfide released
increased with an increase
in temperature during the thermal treatment of all coals under inert
conditions. Hydrogen sulfide that may have dissolved in the potassium
hydroxide solution would form water-soluble potassium hydrosulfide.
The masses of sulfur dioxide absorbed in the scrubber solutions decreased
with an increase in the temperature when heating coals B and C under
oxidizing conditions. This is attributed to the significant amount
of CaO from the complete decomposition of calcite or dolomite at elevated
temperatures. The free CaO captured SO2 to form anhydrite
in the ash or char.

Addition of K2CO3 to
bituminous coal eliminated
release of sulfur gases during pyrolysis at 400 °C. Even at 950
°C, the reduction in sulfur volatilization achieved by K2CO3 addition is still significant. K2CO3 can also affect the caking behavior of bituminous
coals.49,50 There may be some process advantages of
adding relatively inexpensive K2CO3 to bituminous
coal pyrolysis to reduce sulfur gas volatilization.

Thus, the
primary agent for in situ capturing of sulfur gases is
calcium oxide (transformed product of either calcite or dolomite).
Anhydrite or oldhamite (depending on temperature and atmosphere conditions)
is responsible for significant sulfur retention. This in situ capturing
of sulfur gases by CaO can be augmented by the addition of K2CO3 and possibly by MgO from dolomite. Collectively, these
factors can significantly reduce the release of sulfur gases during
pyrolysis, by 54–100%.

Experimental Section
Coal and Lignite Samples
Coarse (<38 mm)-sized bituminous
coal (coal A) and lignite (coal B) samples were taken by the North-West
University (NWU) from a South African Highveld coalfield and Karoo
sequence, respectively. A representative subsample of coal A was mixed
with 5 wt % analytically pure K2CO3 to increase
the concentration of potassium in the sample (referred to as coal
C).

The samples were first crushed to less than 3 mm using a
jaw crusher (Samuel Osborne (SA) Ltd, model 66YROLL) and a grinding
mill (Usborn Coal Equipment). The crushed sample was screened using
a standard sieve to a particle size of <1 mm. Further reduction
of the >1 mm fraction was conducted using a 600 rpm Fritsch P-14
rotary
mill for an hour and a 280 × 230 mm2 macrocrusher
(model number 46-126) containing 10 mm stainless steel balls. Finally,
a laboratory ball mill with stainless steel balls was used to mill
the samples to −212 μm.

Scrubber Solutions for
Absorption of Sulfur Gases from the Thermal
Experiments
Two solutions were used as scrubber solutions.
One liter of 1.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution was prepared
by dissolving 64.34 g of KOH pellets (assay 97.20%; Promark chemicals)
in 500 mL of deionized water and then diluting this solution with
deionized water to the graduation mark of a 1000 mL volumetric flask.
The 0.15 M cadmium acetate solution ((CH3COO)2Cd) was prepared by transferring 40 g of cadmium acetate dihydrate
((CH3.COO)2Cd·2H2O; assay 99%;
SAARChem) into a 1000 mL glass beaker, adding 600 mL deionized water
and 100 mL acetic acid (assay 99.8%; Rochelle Chemicals), and diluted
to the mark with deionized water. Fresh solutions were prepared for
each experiment.

Thermal Treatment Experiments
The
scrubbing system
fitted with glass bottle scrubbers was connected to a high-temperature
tube furnace (model TSH12/75/610: Elite Thermal Systems Ltd.), as
shown in Figure 1.
The furnace can reach a maximum temperature of 1200 °C. Air and
nitrogen lines were also connected to the furnace. For each experiment,
20 g of the desired sample was weighed in a boat crucible, which was
then placed into the tube furnace prior to heating. Before heating,
100 mL of each scrubber solution was added to the scrubber bottles
connected as shown in Figure 1. Cadmium acetate solution was present in the first scrubber
followed by potassium hydroxide solution in the second scrubber to
absorb the gases emitted during the thermal treatment of the coals.
The heating experiments were conducted at 400 and 950 °C for
3 h under air or nitrogen atmospheres.

The rationale for selecting
these temperatures is as follows: First, there is general consensus
that the initial region of active thermal decomposition of most coals
is 350–400 °C;48 heating at
400 °C makes it likely that the coals have passed through the
region of active thermal decomposition but not gone beyond this region.
Second, coals undergo an additional set of reactions in a temperature
region of 550–900 °C, known as the region of secondary
degasification.48 By similar reasoning,
heating at 950 °C makes it likely that the samples have experienced
secondary degasification but have not gone beyond. The scrubber solutions
were connected to the furnace as soon as the sample was introduced
at room temperature, the air or N2 flow was started at
a rate of approximately 80 mL/min, and the gas flow bubbled through
the scrubbers all through heat-up, the reaction, and cool-down. After
the experiment, the residue of each sample was left in the furnace
to cool to room temperature before removal. The heat-up rate of the
furnace was 10 °C/min, whereas the cooling rate was 3 °C/min.
All solid and liquid samples that were generated from the thermal
treatment experiments were prepared and submitted for the analyses
as mentioned in the Analytical Methods section.

Analytical Methods
Samples A–C were submitted to
the South African Bureau of
Standards (SABS), Coal and Mineral Technologies laboratories for the
analyses of the forms of sulfur. The ISO 157 method, Standard Part
11, 1959, was used to determine the concentrations of the different
sulfur forms (pyrite sulfur, sulfate sulfur, and organic sulfur) as
well as mineral sulfur (the sum of pyrite and sulfate sulfur). The
percentages of the total sulfur in the different samples were determined
through an A632 sulfur determinator using the ASTM D4239 method, ASTM
Standards, D2492, Philadephia, 1988.

The following test methods
were used to determine the moisture
content (ISO 11722:1999), ash (ISO 1171:2010), volatile matter content
(ISO 562:2010 and ISO 1170), and ultimate analysis (ISO 12902-CHN
instrumental method). The percentage of the dried basis volatile matter
and the percentage of volatile matter(ar) are calculated by the following
formulas: %volatile matter (db) = volatile matter(ad) ×
100/100 – M(ad) and %volatile matter(ar) = volatile matter(ad)
× 100 – M(ar)/100 – M(ad), where ar is as received, db is dried basis, ad is
air-dried, and M is the moisture content, which are
included in the standard methods, ISO 562:2010 and ISO 1170, respectively.

The original coal samples, along with residual char or ash samples
and yellow precipitate samples from the scrubber solutions, were subjected
to mineralogical analysis using a PANalytical Inc. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) instrument with Rietveld-based X’Pert HighScore Plus
Software.4,5 Each solid sample was spiked with 20% Si
(Aldrich, 99.9% purity) and was subsequently micronized in a McCrone
micronizing mill. The prepared solid samples were submitted for determination
of the concentrations of amorphous compounds and crystalline phases.
Residual char and ash samples were also subjected to X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) analysis using the fusion method, where the solids were fused
into a borosilicate disk6 and analyzed
by ARL 9800XP Thermo-Scientific XRF spectrometry techniques.

The postreaction cadmium acetate and potassium hydroxide scrubber
filtrates from the experiments were mixed (acetic acid was added to
prevent the precipitation of cadmium hydroxide) and submitted to the
NWU Eco-analytical Laboratory (Centre for Water Science) for ion chromatography
(IC) analysis to determine the concentration of sulfate. About 20
μL of the liquid sample was injected into a Metrosep A Supp
4-250/4 anion-exchange column (stationary phase), which was held at
25 °C, with a pressure of 5.83 MPa and a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min.
IC analyses of samples were done under isocratic conditions using
disodium carbonate (Na2CO3) (1.8 mmol/L) and
sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) (1.7 mmol/L) as mobile
phase with a pH 10.30. The standards used during the IC analysis included
fluoride 2.0 mg/L, chloride 2.0 mg/L, nitrite 5.0 mg/L, bromide 10.0
mg/L, and nitrate 10.0 mg/L. CdS precipitate samples were also submitted
for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis
(at NWU) for determination of the concentrations of Cd, S, Fe, Ca,
Pb, Al, and Mg.
