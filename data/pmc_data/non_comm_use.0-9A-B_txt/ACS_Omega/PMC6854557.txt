In vitro experiments
previously published demonstrated the ability
of fullerenes to decrease the capability of organophosphorus (OP)
compounds to inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Experiments described herein
demonstrate molecular level affinity interactions between fullerenes
and the OP test compound paraoxon with NMR spectroscopy. The calculated
binding constant of 19 M–1 indicates that this binding
was not covalent.

Introduction
Acetylcholinesterase
(AChE)-inhibiting organophosphorus (OP) compounds
are toxic substances used as insecticides and nerve gases. Cholinergic
poisoning associated with AChE inhibition can be rapid and severe.1 Although protection from OP compounds can be
provided by protective clothing, poisonings still occur and rapid
treatment with atropine and pralidoxime may be needed for survival.
However, situations in which large numbers of people are exposed,
such as occurred when an OP compound was released in the subway system
of Tokyo in 1995, have prompted the search for additional protectants.2,3

Fullerenes are spherical structures containing 60–80
carbons
in their respective molecular structures. They have been proposed
for a variety of medical uses, including those based on their antioxidant
property and their potential capability to deliver drugs and genes.4−6 The C80 metallofullerenes used in this study have also been proposed
for use as MRI contrast agents.7,8

Previous results
demonstrated protection from OP-induced AChE inhibition
in incubates of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells or hen brain homogenates
containing a series of OP compounds plus fullerenes.9 This protective effect was demonstrated using a wide range
of OP concentrations with a wide variety of derivatized fullerenes.
Delays in OP-induced toxic effects were also demonstrated in vivo.10−12 The experiments outlined in this article were designed to investigate
the mode of action of the OP–fullerene interaction at the molecular
level to help explain how derivatized fullerenes decrease OP toxicity.
The data generated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggest
that molecular binding of an OP compound to a fullerene provides a
possible mechanism for fullerene reduction of OP-induced AChE inhibition
seen in previous studies.9−12

Materials and Methods
Test Materials
For these studies, paraoxon-ethyl (97.5%
pure, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and hydroxylated fullerene nanomaterials
(Luna NanoWorks, Danville, VA) were used. The fullerenes listed in Table 1 include a C70-OH fullerene and a C80 gadolinium trimetasphere metallofullerene
(Gd3N@C80(OH)n).

The
fullerene compounds were prepared by functionalizing the surface of
the cage molecule with water solubilizing small molecule groups. C60(OH)n has approximately 14 hydroxyl
groups on the surface of fullerene C60. C60(COOH)
and C60-pyrrolidine have the same number of six carboxylic
acid and pyrrolidine groups, respectively. C70(OH)n has about 20 hydroxyl groups. M3N@C80(OH)n has 24 hydroxyl groups for both M as Sc and
Gd. C70-Bis-malonate has two malonic acid groups attached
to the fullerene surface (Figure 1).

Chromatographic Methods for the Examination of OP–Fullerene
Interactions
Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)
Initial experiments
were done with a mixture of C70-bis-malonate fullerene
(C70-OH) and paraoxon using silica as the stationary phase
and chloroform/methanol/trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase (50:45:5)
in molar ratios of 1:1, 4:1, and 10:1.

High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC)
HPLC
analysis was also used to examine possible covalent OP–fullerene
interactions. The hypothesis was that the fullerene could form a covalent
bond with the phosphorus of paraoxon, releasing the leaving group p-nitrophenol. For these analyses, each of the six fullerenes
listed in Table 1 was tested. The respective fullerene solutions
were made up in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. Each of the individual
solutions was spiked with 100 μL of 1 μM paraoxon made
up in the same buffer before incubation for 25 min at 37 °C.
A portion of the final sample volumes was aliquotted into 2 mL amber
autosampler vials and loaded into the autosampler of an Agilent 1100
Series HPLC. The respective solutions (20 μL) were injected
for analysis. The analytes of interest were separated on an Agilent
Zorbax XDB C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm × 5 μm) using
a gradient mobile phase composition that started in the aforementioned
phosphate buffer before increasing the concentration of methanol with
a constant flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. UV detection and quantification
of paraoxon and p-nitrophenol were performed at 270
and 312 nm, respectively.

Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Spectroscopy for the Examination
of OP–Fullerene Interactions
Additional interactions
of OP and fullerene were examined by the complexation of paraoxon
with two different hydroxylated fullerenes. The test fullerenes were
the C80 derivative containing gadolinium (Gd3N@C80(OH)n) and a nonmetallic C70 derivative (C70-OH). All proton (1H) and phosphorus (31P) NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Advance III 600 NMR instrument
(600 MHz, 242 MHz, respectively). Prior to the NMR experiments, the
purity of paraoxon was checked in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) with TMS by 1H NMR.

Each of the NMR experiments
with paraoxon and the fullerenes C70-OH or Gd3N@C80(OH)n was run in deuterium oxide (D2O)
with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) 0.04% as the internal
reference (chemical shift δ = 0.00 ppm). Proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were collected for each sample. Increasing
quantities of fullerenes were added to 0.5 mL of a fresh solution
of paraoxon 0.5 mg/mL (1.8 mM) in D2O. The mixture was
homogenized with a vortex mixer, and 10 μL of H3PO4 2% in D2O were added. The solution was then transferred
to a clean, dry NMR tube for analysis. NMR spectra data were acquired
15 min after preparing the tube.

Results
TLC
No changes in migration distances among the fullerene
alone and the fullerene + paraoxon were observed when analyzed at t = 0, 30 min, and 18 h. These results suggest that paraoxon
was not forming a covalent bond with the fullerene molecule.

High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
No significant
changes in paraoxon concentration were observed and the metabolite
of paraoxon, p-nitrophenol, was not detected in any
of the incubated mixtures. The detection limit for p-nitrophenol was set at a concentration of <10–7 M (Table 1 and Figure 2). These results
further substantiate TLC results, indicating that paraoxon was not
forming a covalent bond with the fullerene molecule.

the paraoxon (270 nm, top) and p-nitrophenol (312
nm, middle) control standards and the incubation
mixture of paraoxon with Gd3N@C80(OH)n (bottom), labeled in the figure as GdTMS(OH).

No major change in the chemical shift was observed after
the addition
of sodium chloride to the mixture of C70-OH, even after
long incubation times. Sodium chloride may not be the best salt to
deaggregate the fullerenes as it was difficult to get a strong enough
signal in the presence of sodium chloride. Sodium phosphate buffer
has been reported to be a stronger salt to disrupt aggregation.14

NMR Results for Gd3N@C80(OH)n
(Table 2 and Figure 3) demonstrated an
upfield change in the chemical shift as the concentration of fullerene
was increased. Band broadening in the NMR signal was also observed,
most likely as a result of strong paramagnetic interferences associated
with the increasing inorganic Gd content. Longer acquisition times
were used in an attempt to compensate for this observed effect but
did not produce ideal peak shapes necessary for the quantitative NMR
analysis. As a result, subsequent studies described herein were performed
using the C70-OH fullerene. In doing so, higher concentrations
of the fullerene were able to be used while maintaining ideal peak
shapes, thereby allowing observable chemical shift changes (Δδ)
within a reasonable amount of spectral collection time (Table 3 and Figure 4).

Plotting the difference in the 31P NMR chemical shift
(Δδ) versus fullerene concentration resulted in a binding
isotherm curve that reaches a plateau at around 0.03 M (Figure 5). The binding constant (Kb) could be calculated from the double reciprocal
plot of the binding isotherm plot (Figure 6) following the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation.13  where the binding constant
(Kb) was calculated by dividing the intercept
by the slope
from the double reciprocal plot (1/Δδ) versus 1/[C70] and was determined to be 19 (M)−1.

Discussion
The results suggest that derivatized fullerenes
interact with OP
compounds in a manner much like cyclodextrins that have previously
been shown to decrease the OP capability to inhibit AChE.15−17 The binding constant of three cyclodextrins incubated with paraoxon
ranged from 110 to 182 mole/L in a publication that provided these
data.13 The OP aggregate with a derivatized
fullerene in experiments described here has a binding constant about
10 times lower than cyclodextrin–OP aggregates. This may be
because there is no cavity in the fullerene to complex the OP molecule.
Most of the complexation studies done with OP compounds have been
done with proteins where the hydrophobic and π–π
interactions are larger. For example, the binding constant of paraoxon
to human bovine albumin was found to be 1.914 × 10–4 mole/L.18 The binding constant of paraoxon
to the C70-OH is modest if we compare it to the binding
constant of immobilized paraoxon to cholinesterase (3084–6327
M–1 depending on the enzyme source).19

Another study examined the interaction
of cyclodextrins with two
OP nerve gases and published disassociation (Kd) values of 7–9 mM.20 The Kd of the paraoxon–cyclodextrin aggregates
contrasts with the Kd (0.34 mM) reported
for paraoxon with human recombinant acetylcholinesterase, a difficult
disassociation.21

OP compounds interact
with solubilized fullerenes, but the difference
in binding constants between OP compounds with cholinesterases versus
OP compounds with solubilized fullerenes is vast. Also, although not
specifically calculated for the compounds used here, the disassociation
constant for OP–fullerene is highly likely to be greater than
for OP–AChE. This suggests that solubilized fullerenes are
likely to only have a minor role for prophylaxis of potentially severe
OP toxicity after dermal exposure, including toxicity associated with
OP nerve agents. However, further exploration may be warranted to
determine if, especially in combination with other protectants, they
could be used after dermal exposure to OP compounds occurs, especially
if signs of toxicity had not appeared before treatment could commence.
Topical exposures to toxic OP compounds are relevant, and time for
absorption is longer by this route of exposure, so substances like
fullerenes that interact with OP compounds but do not have intrinsic
toxicities could have future value in amelioration of OP-induced toxicities
especially if applied alone or in combination before potential exposure
or after exposure and before onset of symptoms. Further experiments
are needed to determine such potentially beneficial possibilities.
