The complex nature of multifactorial diseases, such as
Morbus Alzheimer,
has produced a strong need to design multitarget-directed ligands
to address the involved complementary pathways. We performed a purposive
structural modification of a tetratarget small-molecule, that is contilisant,
and generated a combinatorial library of 28 substituted chromen-4-ones.
The compounds comprise a basic moiety which is linker-connected to
the 6-position of the heterocyclic chromenone core. The syntheses
were accomplished by Mitsunobu- or Williamson-type ether formations.
The resulting library members were evaluated at a panel of seven human
enzymes, all of which being involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration.
A concomitant inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase and human monoamine
oxidase B, with IC50 values of 5.58 and 7.20 μM,
respectively, was achieved with the dual-target 6-(4-(piperidin-1-yl)butoxy)-4H-chromen-4-one (7).

==== Body
Introduction
The treatment of multifactorial diseases
requires interactions
with several biological targets. Multitarget compounds combine activity
at more than a single biological target in one molecule. They offer
two or more pharmacophores, which are either structurally overlapping
or separated by a spacer. The design of single-molecule multitarget
drugs has become an increasingly attractive option with a variety
of advantages, compared to combination therapies.1,2 The
concept and application of multitarget small molecules (MSMs) include
the simultaneous modulation of receptors and the inhibition of enzymatic
systems implemented in the progress of the disease.2−4 Neurodegenerative
diseases are intensively investigated employing multitarget approaches.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process characterized
by a progressive decline of memory and learning capabilities resulting
from complex and multifactorial, but not completely identified, biological
events. Among these, oxidative stress and a deficit of neurotransmitters
as well as neuronal death play a key role.5 Even the most substantiated and investigated hypotheses of AD, beta-amyloid
and tau, have not resulted in Alzheimer’s drug breakthrough
yet.6

Several strategies are currently
applied for AD therapy; acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), as well as monoamine oxidases
(MAO) A and B, are investigated as MSM targets for AD treatment.2,4 From these, AChE still remains a valuable target with clinical success
in AD treatment, as the selective loss of cholinergic neurons in AD
results in a deficit of acetylcholine in specific brain regions that
mediate cognitive functions. Inhibition of AChE increases the acetylcholine
concentration in the synaptic cleft, thus enhancing central cholinergic
neurotransmission. In addition, the noncholinergic actions of AChE
might affect the aggregation of toxic amyloid peptides.2 MAO enzymes catalyze the deamination of neurotransmitters
and thereby release reactive oxygen species. These enzymes contribute
to the symptoms of dementia and dopamine degradation. MAO inhibitors
possess neuroprotective effects, reduce oxidative stress, and are
frequently administered in the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders
such as AD and Parkinson’s disease.7,8 A
variety of dual-targeting compounds has been developed combining the
moieties for AChE and MAO inhibition in one molecule.2,4

A recent communication9 on the pharmacological
profile of a highly advanced hit compound for AD (contilisant, Figure 1) showed it to be
an antioxidant, permeable, strong neuroprotective agent, able to increase
the level of neurotransmitters in the brain. This tetratarget compound
inhibited human cholinesterases (AChE, IC50 = 0.53 μM;
BChE, IC50 = 1.69 μM) and human monoamine oxidases
(MAO-B, IC50 = 0.078 μM; MAO-A, IC50 =
0.145 μM) and specifically modulated the human histamine H3
(Ki = 10.8 nM, antagonist) and sigma 1
receptors (Ki = 65.2 nM, agonist) in a
manner suitable for AD therapy. Being active in appropriate AD animal
models, contilisant exceeded the efficacy of the marketed drug donepezil.9

Figure 1 Design of chromenone-based MSMs.

The current research project was directed toward
MSMs, which, in
contrast to contilisant, might act as reversible MAO inhibitors. For
this purpose, we planned to substitute the N-methyl
propargylamine motif responsible for irreversible MAO inhibition by
a typical pharmacophore for reversible inhibition, serving at the
same time as the central heterocyclic core replacing the indole. This
strategy can be realized with several building blocks such as 4H-3,1-benzothiazin-4-ones,10 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinones,11 and coumarins.12−14 We decided to incorporate the chromen-4-one structure into our envisaged
molecules (Figure 1), as chromen-4-ones constitute well-established reversible MAO inhibitors.14−18 Moreover, as potential targets for our MSMs, we considered further
human enzymes which are involved in pathophysiological processes of
neurodegenerative diseases (see below), that is, matriptase-2 (MT-2),
monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and cholesterol esterase (CEase).

Results and Discussion
The present versatile design
allowed us to introduce linkers of
various lengths attached to differently sized cyclic (or acyclic)
tertiary amine moieties. The envisaged series 1–28 consists of groups of four compounds each with the same amino motif
and n methylene units ranging from 2 to 5 (Table 1). In order to synthesize
these compounds, the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry (IQOG, CSIC)
established a collaboration with Eli Lilly’s Open Innovation
Drug Discovery program, granting access to their Automated Synthesis
Lab. This program featured a globally accessible, remote-controlled
automated lab that can perform many different types of chemical transformations.19 All steps are controlled by a customized software
and can be monitored in real time. The lab works continuously and
is equipped with conventional and microwave heating, liquid-handling
robots, work-up stations, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
for reaction monitoring, solvent evaporation, and sample preparation
for automated purification.

Table 1 Inhibition of Human Enzymes by Chromenones 1–28
a The method for the preparation of
the compounds is given in parentheses.

b n.i. (no inhibition) refers to IC50 > 100
μM (for AChE and BChE) and to <5% inhibitory
activity@10 μM (for MAO-A, MT-2, MAGL, and CEase), respectively.

The products were synthesized through the formation
of an aryl–alkyl
ether bond, either by Mitsunobu- or Williamson-type etherification
(Scheme 1, Supporting Information). Thus, the readily available
6-hydroxychromen-4-one20 and the respective
amino alcohol were subjected to the Mitsunobu reaction using triphenylphosphine
and di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DBAD) in dichloromethane
(Method A, Table 1).21 Combining triphenylphosphine and the dialkyl
azodicarboxylate into one reagent, (cyanomethylene)tributylphosphorane
(CMBP) has been shown to be a particularly effective phosphorane ylide
for the Mitsunobu reaction.21,22 This reagent was applied
and the reactions were performed in toluene at 100 °C for the
preparation of additional final compounds (Method B, Table 1). A further subset of products
was synthesized by following a two-step route, involving the O-alkylation of 6-hydroxychromen-4-one with an appropriate
α,ω-dibromoalkane to produce an ether intermediate, which
was used in situ, owing to its remaining alkyl bromide moiety, for
the subsequent N-alkylation of the amino component
(Method C, Table 1).23,24 In case of compounds 4, 24, and 27, we observed an unexpected cleavage of the vinylogous lactone,
and the final compounds were therefore produced through an acid-promoted,
microwave-assisted ring closure (see Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Entries to Chromenones 1–28
Moreover, (R)-2-methylpyrrolidine
was alkylated
with 2-bromoethanol and 3-bromo-1-propanol, respectively, and the
hydroxyl groups were converted to mesylates which were finally used
for the ether bond formation providing 25 and 26 (Method D, Table 1). All compounds were isolated by a strong cation exchange (SCX)
procedure, applying a benzenesulfonic acid-bonded sorbent. The basic
products were liberated with ammoniacal methanol and obtained in moderate
yields and excellent purity (see Supporting Information).

The in vitro measurements of cholinesterase activity were
carried
out following the method of Ellman, with 5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic
acid applied as a chromogenic reagent to detect the thiocholine liberated
from acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, respectively.25 The majority of the chromenones showed inhibitory
activity against AChE (Table 1), with the most advantageous amino moieties being pyrrolidine
(1–4), piperidine (5–8), and
azepane (21–24). More polar termini, that is,
morpholine (9–12) and N-methylpiperazine
(13–16), caused a reduction of potency. Derivatives 25–28 were weaker AChE inhibitors than their isomeric
counterparts 5–8, probably because of the sterically
more demanding 2-methylpyrrolidine moiety. Our data revealed a clear
influence of the linker length on AChE inhibition, with four- and
five-membered carbon-containing chains (n = 4 and
5) being more favorable than ethylene and trimethylene linkers (n = 2 and 3). This trend was observed throughout all the
seven groups of tested chromenones.

AChE-catalyzed substrate
cleavage follows an acyl transfer mechanism
and is mediated by the catalytic triad Ser203–His447–Glu334.
While the esteratic site is located at the bottom of a deep and narrow
gorge, the peripheral anionic site (PAS) on the AChE surface is involved
in ligand guiding and noncholinergic functions. It is formed by the
residues of Tyr72, Asp74, Tyr124, Trp286, and Tyr341, which are clustered
around the entrance of the active site gorge. It was expected from
structurally related AChE inhibitors,13,18,24,26 including donepezil,27 that the accommodation of the active chromenones
is stabilized by cation−π interactions between the inhibitor’s
protonated tertiary amine and the aromatic residues of Trp86 and Phe338
at the midpoint of the gorge. However, based on our docking investigations
with the prototypical compound 7, it aligned in an inversely
oriented manner with the chromenone interacting with the catalytic
anionic site (CAS) and the amine pointing toward the PAS (Figure 2A). Specifically,
the chromenone system of 7 is assumed to undergo π–π
stacking with the indole side chain of Trp86 and hydrophobic interactions
with His447 of the catalytic triad. The piperidinium moiety of 7 is engaged in a π–cation formation with Tyr341
and an attractive charge interaction with Asp74. The analogous inhibitor 24 bearing a linkage elongated by one methylene group and
an azepanium moiety showed a similar accommodation in the active site
of AChE (see Supporting Information, Figure
S1).

Mixed-type inhibition is known for donepezil28 and several other AChE inhibitors.4,29,30 We chose active chromenone inhibitors
out
of each group, namely 3, 8, 11, 15, 20, 24, and 27 (Table 2), and carried
out kinetic measurements with different substrate and inhibitor concentrations.
The dissociation constants Ki and αKi were obtained, where Ki describes the competitive and αKi the uncompetitive contribution to AChE inhibition. A pronounced
competitive mode was mainly determined (α = 2.1–3.3),
with the exception of 11 (α = 0.7), where the affinity
to the enzyme–substrate complex may arise from interactions
between the inhibitor and regions not involved in substrate binding.

determined for 24.

Both cholinesterases have widespread but different
brain distributions.
AChE represents the major therapeutic target of cholinesterase inhibitors,
whereas BChE is considered to act as a coregulator of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. In AD patients, a significant increase of cortical
BChE levels was found. In contrast to AChE activity, that of BChE
progressively increases with the advance of dementia. Hence, BChE
inhibition may provide additional benefits in AD therapy.2,31−33 We identified just two chromenones, 24 and 25, with stronger activity against BChE than AChE
(Table 1). The most
potent BChE inhibitor of the series, that is 24, bears
the most extended aliphatic substituent of the present chromenone
series, which obviously facilitates a preferred interaction with the
active site of BChE being larger and able to accommodate bulkier substrates,
compared to AChE (for docking studies with 24 in the
active site of BChE, see Supporting Information, Figure S2).34

Compound 24 was selected for a kinetic study at BChE
in the presence of different substrate and inhibitor concentrations.
The mixed-type inhibition as noted for AChE was also observed for
BChE with a pronounced competitive portion and an α value of
5.0 for this dual cholinesterase inhibitor (Table 2).

The two MAO isozymes are involved
in neurodegenerative diseases.
Hyperactivity of MAO enzymes, decreasing the concentration of dopaminergic
and serotoninergic neurotransmitters, has been observed in AD patients.4,7,35 The expression of MAO-B in neuronal
tissues increases with aging, resulting in increased dopamine metabolism
and higher levels of hydrogen peroxide and oxidative free radicals.
MAO-B is therefore thought to play a pivotal role in the progression
of AD.7,18 As MAO-A contributes to toxin-induced apoptosis
and striatal damage of neuronal cells, this isoform also represents
a target for the development of MSMs.4,18 In this study,
chromenones 1–28 were investigated for the inhibition
of MAO-B and MAO-A using human recombinant enzymes and applying the
Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay.12 At
a single concentration of 10 μM, several chromenones exhibited
MAO-B inhibitory activity, whereas only one compound, namely 10, was notably active against MAO-A (Table 1). The best four compounds at MAO-B (7, 9, 10, and 21),
as well as two selected because of their anticholinesterase activity
(3 and 24), were subjected to concentration-dependent
analyses (Table 2).
IC50 values between 1 and 7 μM were obtained for
the most potent MAO-B inhibitors out of this series. The reversibility
of MAO-B inhibition was exemplarily demonstrated for compound 7 (see Supporting Information,
Figure S3). Chromenone 10 turned out to be equipotent
against both MAO isoforms (Table 2).

For 3-substituted coumarins and chromen-4-ones,
a plausible binding
mode within the MAO-B active site has been proposed where the unsubstituted
face of the heterobicyclic core is directed to the flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, in close proximity to Tyr398 and Tyr435.14,17 A similar accommodation of our 6-substituted chromen-4-ones with
the fused heteroaromatic ring oriented toward FAD was expected and
confirmed by an exemplary docking approach with inhibitor 7 (Figure 2B).

Human MT-2, a type-2 transmembrane serine protease, is the main
proteolytic regulator of iron homeostasis. MT-2 cleaves hemojuvelin,
a coreceptor for bone morphogenic proteins, which induces hepcidin
transcription through a Smad signaling pathway. The inhibition of
MT-2, leading to reduced plasma iron levels, was postulated as a new
therapeutic opportunity to treat iron overload diseases, such as hemochromatosis
and β-thalassemia.36,37 MT-2 is mainly expressed
in the liver, but low expression levels have also been found in the
brain.38 As brain iron accumulation is
a characteristic feature in several neurodegenerative disorders such
as AD,39 we included MT-2 in our multitarget
screening. MT-2 exhibits primary substrate specificity for basic amino
acids, and these chromenones, all of them with a basic nitrogen within
the side chain, were considered as possible candidates for MT-2 inhibition.
As a source for MT-2, we used stably transfected human embryonic kidney
(HEK) cells as wild-type HEK cells do not produce MT-2.36 An established fluorometric assay with the peptidic
substrate Boc–Gln–Ala–Arg–AMC was applied,
and the formation of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was monitored.40 However, none of the chromenones caused a noteworthy
MT-2 inhibition (Table 1).

MAGL and CEase also belong to the family of serine hydrolases.
MAGL preferably degrades monoacylglycerols including the endocannabinoid
2-arachidonyl glycerol that is hydrolyzed to glycerol and the eicosanoid
arachidonic acid, a precursor of prostaglandins. 2-Arachidonyl glycerol
is the endogenous ligand of the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors
1 and 2.41 Inhibition of MAGL was shown
to have protective effects in AD progression by preventing the formation
and accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and the expression of
BACE 1, maintaining the integrity of hippocampal synaptic structure
and function, thus improving spatial learning and memory in mice.42 Cholesterol is a regulator of lipid organization,
the precursor of neurosteroid biosynthesis, and important in the development
and progression of AD.43 It was recently
reported that the inhibition of CEase reduced the concentrations of
amyloid-β42 oligomers and increased the concentrations
of the corresponding monomers, which protected neurons against synapse
damage.44 Thus, MAGL and CEase seemed to
be adequate enzymes for the multitarget approach together with cholinesterases
and MAO-A and B. For the quantification of the MAGL and CEase activities,
the chromogenic 4-nitrophenyl butyrate and the fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl
butyrate were used.45 However, the chromenones 1–28 exhibited neither MAGL nor CEase inhibitory activity
(Table 1).

Conclusions
In this study, we have selected seven human
enzymes which can be
considered to constitute relevant drug targets for an MSM approach
for neurodegenerative diseases. Our inhibitor design provided a systematically
combined library of chromen-4-ones employing structural features for
affinity toward cholinesterases and monoamine oxidases. Screening
of this library revealed chromenone 7 as a potent dual-target
small molecule with single-digit micromolar IC50 values
at the particularly AD-relevant enzyme combination of AChE and MAO-B.
Another library member, 24, targeted both cholinesterases,
and chromenone 10 showed inhibitory activity against
both MAO isozymes. We expanded our screening portfolio by further
enzymes which have hitherto not been considered for a multitarget
application against Morbus Alzheimer and related disorders. Although
not successful with the present set of compounds, we will focus on
elaborating such an extended set of enzymes in future multitarget
studies.
