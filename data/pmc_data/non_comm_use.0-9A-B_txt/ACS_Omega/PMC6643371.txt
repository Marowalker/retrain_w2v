Intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) exist in highly dynamic
conformational ensembles, which pose a major obstacle for drug development
targeting IDPs because traditional rational drug design relies on
unique three-dimensional structures. Here, we analyzed the conservation
(especially structural conservation) of potentially druggable cavities
in 22 ensembles of IDPs. It was found that there is considerable conservation
for potentially druggable cavities within each ensemble. The average
common atom percentage of potentially druggable cavities is as high
as 54%. The average root-mean-squared deviation of common atoms ranges
between 1 and 8 Å for multichain IDPs, and a common pocket is
kept after direct alignment of cavities. In addition, the conservation
of potentially druggable cavities varies among different proteins.
In the comparison of multi- and single-chain IDPs, some multichain
IDPs have an extremely high conservation, whereas another multichain
IDPs’ conservation appears worse, and the single-chain IDPs
have relatively moderate conservations. This study is a new attempt
to generally assess the potentially druggable cavities in IDPs for
taking IDPs as druggable targets, and this work also lends support
to the opinion of IDPs tending to bind to “multiconformational
affinity” compounds.

1 Introduction
Intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) have attracted a considerable
interest owing to their vital functions in physiological processes1−5 and their abundant existence in all species.6−9 Numerous IDPs are associated with
human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative
diseases, and diabetes.10−13 Therefore, IDPs have been recognized as important
targets in drug design.14−17 On the other hand, IDPs usually exist in highly dynamic
conformational ensembles as “protein clouds”,17−19 and ligands may bind to IDPs in a way of “ligand clouds around
protein clouds”.20 This is a major
obstacle for drug design targeting IDPs because traditional rational
drug design relies on the unique three-dimensional structure of proteins.21,22 As a result, the progress in drug designs for IDPs is limited,23−30 most cases were carried out by experimental screening, and only
a rare example was achieved via rational design.27

A prerequisite of small-molecule drug design is the
druggability
of protein targets, that is, whether they have suitable cavities for
ligand binding.31,32 The druggability is usually accessed
based on the size, shape, and physicochemical properties of the surface
cavities. The average cavity number per 100 residues is ∼3.4
for IDPs, slightly larger than that for ordered proteins (∼2.8).33 Surprisingly, the average potentially druggable
probability of cavities in IDPs was estimated to be 9%, almost twice
that for ordered proteins (5%).33 However,
it should be clarified that these numbers and druggability of IDPs
are averages for many distinct conformations in their ensembles. In
this regard, the conservation of particular cavities is critical and
should be further considered. A schematic analysis is demonstrated
in Figure 1. Intuitively,
there are three types of cavities existing in IDPs, the cavities of
type-I are structural conservatives in different conformations of
a certain ensemble; their druggability is poor and cannot be used
for drug design. For the cavities of type-II, although they all maintain
good druggability, their constituents or conformation or both changes
across the ensemble, that is, the cavity conservation is poor; therefore,
they cannot be used as drug targets either. The cavities of type-III,
on the other hand, have good druggability and maintain a good conservation
among most conformations of the ensemble, which are ideal drug target
sites to focus on. The number and location of three types of cavities
are not confined similar to schematics.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram illustrating
the interplay between the druggability
and conservation of cavities in IDPs. Type-I cavities maintain good
conservation but poor druggability. Type-II cavities maintain druggability
but have low structural conservation for the binding site because
of conformational changes. Type-III cavities keep both good druggability
and conservation, which are ideal drug targets.

In this article, we put forward methods to study the conservation
of potentially druggable cavities in IDPs and their possibility of
being drug targets, which may be used for finding targets before screening
ligands against IDPs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Data for Analysis
The analyzed dataset
was constructed based on pE-DB, a database for the deposition of structural
ensembles of IDPs based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and other data measured in solution.34 Ensembles in pE-DB usually contain a high number
of conformations (with an equal weight in the spirit of important
sampling in statistics), which is necessary for the analysis of cavity
conservation. For a full analysis, the oncoprotein c-Myc is also included
in our dataset, for which structure-based rational inhibitor design
has been successfully performed,27 and
the conformational ensemble was obtained from large-scale molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations.20

All
conformational ensembles are analyzed using the program CAVITY developed
by Yuan et al.31 to provide information
about their binding cavities, such as the number of cavities in each
conformation, their druggability, and geometrical parameters. The
predicted cavities are classified by CAVITY into three types according
to their CavityDrugScore: druggable, undruggable, and amphibious (its
druggability is not good as the potentially druggable cavities but
still better than the undruggable ones). A brief introduction about
CAVITY can be found in Materials and Methods. Only potentially druggable cavities are further analyzed because
of their potential in drug design. It is noted that CAVITY and other
existing druggability analyzing algorithms have been trained on globular
proteins; therefore, their accuracy may drop for IDPs. However, in
a recent successful example on c-Myc,27 Yu et al. used CAVITY to identify potential druggable cavities and
used Glide (a virtual screening program originally developed for ordered
proteins) to screen potential binding compounds, and finally 7 out
of 273 tested compounds exhibited a good activity in further experiments.
This seems to suggest that CAVITY and other existing algorithms may
be used for IDPs as a helpful first step before more accurate algorithms
are developed specifically.

Comparing all cavities with each
other directly is not reasonable
in conservation analysis because the number of cavities for one protein
alone is large. In addition, some cavities are obviously in different
parts of the protein and cannot be consistent, and thus a direct comparison
would decrease the overall consistency. Therefore, a simple clustering
to group the cavities of a protein was artificially performed. We
have calculated the mean sequence position (δ) of all residues
for each cavity to approximately estimate its specific position within
the protein. For a protein with a wide range of δ values, cavities
are artificially divided into 1–3 groups to reduce unnecessary
comparison and improve accuracy. The classification results are shown
in the Supporting Information. Cavity conservation
is evaluated within each group.

The resulting dataset and some
of their average properties are
listed in Table 1.
Among pE-DB, 6 ensembles (1AAB, 3AAD, 4AAD, 5AAD, 6AAD, and 9AAA) have too few potentially
druggable cavities and are thus discarded in our analysis. We have
divided the systems into single chain and multichain, which contain
12 and 7 ensembles, respectively. The conformation number of the multichain
ensembles is much smaller than that of the single-chain ones, and
their analysis results are less accurate statistically (see the Supporting Information for a brief discussion
on the effect of sample size). Therefore, we only discuss the multichain
systems very briefly (in Figure 9 below), whereas the emphasis is put on the single-chain
ones.

2.2 Surface Area, Volume, and pKd (Fundamental Information of a Cavity)
CAVITY
provides information about the surface area and volume of each single
cavity and predicts the binding pKd with
properly designed ligands.31 We have calculated
the average and standard deviation of these properties of potentially
druggable cavities for each ensemble and plot the results of single-chain
systems in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Histograms illustrate the properties (surface area, volume, and
pKd) of potentially druggable cavities
from different ensembles of single-chain IDPs. Cavities in each ensemble
were divided into 1–3 groups as listed in Table S2.

The results of Figure 2 clearly show that
the average surface area and the volume
of potentially druggable cavities of a protein ensemble differ from
those of another ensemble. 6AAA (p15PAF) has the largest
cavity surface area and volume. The standard deviations within an
ensemble are smaller, suggesting the consistency in the size of potentially
druggable cavities. On the other hand, the predicted pKd (ligand-binding affinity) is high and similar, except
for c-Myc, indicating these IDPs have the ligand binding sites for
drug design. As shown in Figure 2, it is reliable to divide some of the ensembles into
1–3 groups because the difference of the surface area and volume
between different groups is large, and if mixed together, the overall
results will omit important differences.

Compared to the ordered
proteins, the potentially druggable cavities
of IDPs have larger surface area and volume (see the Supporting Information). From the geometric perspective, the
deeper the pocket, the stronger its ability to bind small molecule
is. The ratio of volume/surface approximately reflects the average
depth of cavities. The calculated average volume/surface ratio of
potentially druggable cavities is 2.29 Å for IDPs, almost doubles
that for order proteins (1.33 Å). It reflects the structural
basis underlying the excellent druggability of IDPs.

2.3 Figure Factor (Shape Parameter of a Cavity)
To quantitatively
measure the cavity shape and study its structural
conservation, we refer to the algorithms in geography and use the
following Boyce–Clark figure factor35,36 1  to analyze the geometry of the cavity
vacant
(the vacant space surrounded by cavity wall) by projecting it onto
a plane perpendicular to the maximum depth direction of the cavity.
In eq 1, ri is the radial length from the centroid
of the planar graph to the boundary, and n is the
number of equally spaced radials taken. The figure factor quantitatively
measures the difference between the considered shape and a standard
circle. Its value ranges from 0 for a standard circle to 200 for a
straight line, and it is equal to ∼8.9 for a square.36 In addition, the maximum depth of cavities provided
by CAVITY is also analyzed. The results of the figure factor and maximum
depth of potentially druggable cavities in single-chain IDPs are shown
in Figure 3 with representative
cavities. The average figure factor varies over a wide range. The
lowest figure factor is found in 2AAD, whose cavity vacant is circular
in shape. The largest figure factor is found in 6AAC, whose cavity
vacant is highly irregular. The conservation of cavities in terms
of the standard deviation in different proteins is different. Better
conservation with lower standard deviation relative to the mean of
the figure factor is observed in 2AAA, 4AAB, and 5AAA, whereas the
conservation in 1AAA, 2AAD, and 9AAC is relatively worse. In addition,
the three parts (groups) in 7AAC or 8AAC are obviously different in
the average figure factor.

Figure 3 Histograms showing the average figure factor
and maximum depth
of potentially druggable cavities in different ensembles of single-chain
IDPs. Error bars represent standard deviations. Representative cavities
with figure factor and depth values similar to the average values
in each ensemble are displayed as space filled models.

2.4 Common Atom Percentage
(Composition Parameter
of a Cavity)
To measure the composition conservation of potentially
druggable cavities, we compare two cavities and calculate the percentage
of common atoms as 2  where ncommon(i,j) is the number of common non-H atoms
appearing in both cavity i and cavity j, and ni and nj are the non-H atom number
of cavity i and j, respectively.
It is noted that cavities of each conformation were divided into 1–3
groups according to the residue number range as described above, and ncommon(i,j) is computed only for i and j belonging
to the same group.

Figure 4 shows that a high proportion of potentially druggable
cavities are well-conserved in composition with pcommon(i,j) larger than
50%. The most conserved systems are 2AAA, 4AAB-1, 5AAA-2, 7AAC-1,
and 7AAC-3, which have an average pcommon of 0.67 ± 0.12, 0.64 ± 0.16, 0.65 ± 0.13, 0.64 ±
0.18, and 0.65 ± 0.17, respectively, indicating that the shift
of potentially druggable cavities among conformations is small. The
overall average of pcommon for potentially
druggable cavities in single-chain IDPs is 0.518, which is close to
the value determined previously for all cavities (0.52).33 The least conserved systems are 2AAD-2 (with
⟨pcommon(i,j)⟩ = 0.33 ± 0.18) and 9AAC-2 (with ⟨pcommon(i,j)⟩ = 0.35 ± 0.19).

Figure 4 Common-atom percentage of potentially
druggable cavities in different
ensembles. (a) pcommon(i,j) plotted in ascending order for each ensemble.
The data points are evenly spaced within each ensemble to span the
full horizontal range. Some values were omitted to avoid crowding.
Red lines indicate the level of 50%. (b) Average of pcommon(i,j) in different
ensembles. Error bars represent the standard deviation.

The distribution of pcommon(i,j) for each ensemble is given
in Figure 5. The distributions
are all wide, with the tails approaching the upper limit of pcommon = 1. After removing the first data point
for uncorrelated cavities with pcommon ≈ 0, 9 of all 12 ensembles can be well-described by a Gaussian
distribution (solid lines in Figure 5). The remaining three ensembles have relatively small
numbers of conformations and potentially druggable cavity data for
fitting.

cavities for different conformational ensembles. Red lines are fitted
to the scattering data with a Gaussian function.

2.5 Root–Mean-Squared Deviation (Parameter
of a Conformation Change of a Cavity)
The root-mean-squared
deviation (rmsd) of the atomic positions between two structures is
often used to characterize the conformational differences of ordered
proteins. To measure the conformation conservation of potentially
druggable cavities, we calculated the rmsd based on common atoms between
any two cavities in an ensemble, as explained in the Materials and Methods. The results are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 (a) Average rmsd of potentially
druggable cavities for different
ensembles. Error bars represent standard deviations. (b) Distribution
of the rmsd of potentially druggable cavities for different conformational
ensembles. Red lines are fitted to the scattering data with a Gaussian
function.

The average rmsd values of potentially
druggable cavities in different
ensembles vary from 5.14 Å for 2AAA and 5.49 Å for c-Myc
to 11.21 Å for 7AAC-2 (Figure 6a). The rmsds are significantly larger than what was
determined previously for all cavities (∼3.5 Å).33 The reason for the difference is because potentially
druggable cavities are usually larger and contain more atoms. In general
cases, the more atoms in comparison, the relatively larger rmsd value
is. On the other hand, the rmsd distribution is wide (Figure 6b), with considerable cavities
possessing small rmsd values.

To present the conserved conformations
of potentially druggable
cavities in IDPs more intuitively, we have drawn two examples of aligned
cavities in Figure 7. For 2AAA, among the 130 conformations in the ensemble, there are
only six potentially druggable cavities. After alignment (Figure 7a), a common pocket
is clearly exposed. At the same time, magnification of a few local
regions (insets in Figure 7) shows that the spatial deviation among the corresponding
chemical groups is small. For c-Myc in which inhibitors have been
successfully designed, although the conformations are highly diverse
as revealed previously,20 the potentially
druggable cavities are still in good conservation and the opening
of the pocket is not disrupted, as shown in Figure 7b. Such a structural diversity for c-Myc
has not prohibited the design of inhibitors against c-Myc. Therefore,
potentially druggable cavities of IDPs are well-conserved in conformation.
This lends support to the optimism of rational drug design for IDPs.

Figure 7 Examples
of potentially druggable cavities that are aligned together
to demonstrate the conformational conservation in (a) 2AAA and (b)
c-Myc. In each panel, a potentially druggable cavity was chosen as
the reference conformation to align other cavities based on common
atoms. Common atoms are shown in sticks and surfaces, whereas other
parts are shown as lines. Insets are magnified sections. Graphics
is prepared using PyMOL.

In general, the ensembles of IDPs in the pE-DB database that
we
considered have many conformations in each entry [compared with the
protein data bank (PDB) dataset], which greatly facilitates the conservation
analysis. PDB also provide some useful structures of IDPs, for example,
a Disprot-pdb dataset with 15 entries was constructed (listed in Table 2) by selecting proteins
with more than 10 conformations and at least 50% of the solved amino
acids in the PDB structure being shown disordered in DisProt.33 However, the number of conformations in Disprot-pdb
is small, and only a few provide sufficient amount of potentially
druggable cavities for the conservation analysis. Analysis on the
few systems from Disprot-pdb is shown in Figure 8. The potentially druggable cavities in the
Disprot-pdb dataset can be seen to have high common atom percentage
values (>70%) and low RMSD values (<4 Å), being more conservative
than those in the pE-DB dataset. The alignment of cavity conformation
(Figure 8b–d)
also illustrates the existence of a common pocket and the spatial
coincidence of groups from different conformations.

What is more, another small conformational ensemble of c-Myc370–409 (Apo and Holo states) calculated the consistence
of the binding pockets in representative conformations, which have
virtually screened the inhibitors with computation and been experimentally
proved.27 The common atom percentage (pcommon) and rmsds are 0.58 ± 0.19 and 4.32
± 0.23, respectively, which are almost same with the consistent
results in our study.

2.6 Multichain Proteins (Oligomeric
Proteins)
An oligomer is a short multimer formed by a smaller
number of monomer
units.37 In contrast to the above single-chain
proteins, the cavity in oligomeric proteins often consists of more
than two chains. In the same way as single-chain protein analysis,
we also analyzed the surface area/volume, pKd, figure factor, common atom percentage, and rmsd of potentially
druggable cavities in oligomeric IDPs, and the results are shown in Table 1 and the Supporting Information. In general, the conservation
of potentially druggable cavities in multichain proteins is better
than that in single-chains, and the average rmsd of common atoms ranges
between 1 and 8 Å. That is, because the multichain protein should
be more conformationally stable than single-chain protein. The difference
between multichain and single chain ensembles can be determined intuitively
by plotting the average common atom percentage of every ensemble and
the corresponding rmsd in one graph, which is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Average common atom percentage and rmsd of single-chain systems
(squares) and multichain systems (circles). Better conservation for
chains is found when the corresponding data points are located in
the bottom-right corner.

It can be seen from Figure 9 that the conservation of the different ensembles is
quite
different. For multichain ensembles, the data points of 2AAB, 3AAA,
4AAA, and 7AAA are located primarily on the left side of the plot,
which is indicated by a red ellipse. On the other hand, data points
of 3AAB, 5AAC, and 8AAA are located in the bottom right part of the
plot. The points of single-chain IDPs, however, are more centrally
located in the graph. Multichain ensembles appear to have larger range
of conservation, from which some multichain IDPs have an extremely
high conservation, whereas another multichain IDPs’ conservation
appears worse. For 5AAC, the conservation of different parts varies
considerably. The pcommon of the three
parts are 0.40, 0.28, and 0.84, respectively. Further analysis and
aligned images are reported in the Supporting Information.

Three are three groups of protein/peptide
with more than one ensemble
in pE-DB: synuclein, CYNEX4, and HSPB6. For synuclein, there are α-,
β-, and α/β-hybrid-types, their pcommon (0.42 ± 0.18, 0.43 ± 0.20, 0.38 ±
0.18) and rmsd (7.83 ± 2.53, 7.83 ± 3.08, 8.14 ± 2.73)
are highly consistent. For CYNEX4, after the wide type is mutated
into T266D, the conservation of potentially druggable cavities slightly
decreases from 0.32 ± 0.17 to 0.26 ± 0.14. For HSPB6, there
are four ensembles with different fragment lengths between 104 and
160, and both pcommon and rmsd exhibit
high fluctuations, which may result from the length difference or
the small conformation numbers of ensembles.

2.7 Some
Remarks
In general, the global
druggability of IDPs is affected by three important factors: the probability
of druggable cavities in the conformation ensemble; the expected pKd values of druggable cavities with ligands;
and the conservation of druggable cavities, that is, the possibility
of a ligand to bind to many conformations. It is noted that even if
the probability of druggable cavities is low, effective inhibition
to IDPs is still possible because the binding of a ligand to druggable
cavities would stabilize the corresponding conformations and change
the ensemble distribution. In our current study, it is difficult to
quantitatively clarify the relative importance of these factors because
ligands are not explicitly considered in the analysis. However, in
a recent combined experimental and computational study on c-Myc, it
was revealed that all six active compounds identified in experiments
for c-Myc are “multiconformational affinity” compounds
(i.e., compounds that bind to various groups of conformations with
similar affinity) in virtual screening.27 This suggests that the last factor is essential for drug design
upon IDPs. More future works are needed to understand the druggability
and design strategy difference between IDPs and ordered proteins.

On the other hand, conformational ensembles are the basis of the
drug design targeting IDPs. Reliable force fields are essential for
accurate characterization of conformational ensembles of IDPs, as
the number of degrees of conformational freedom far exceeds the number
of available experimental observables. Most previous force fields
were developed to target ordered proteins.38 In recent years, some force fields have also been developed to improve
their accuracy in modeling IDPs.39,40 For example,
a newly modified CHARMM36m was demonstrated to generate conformational
ensembles in agreement with the experimental data.40 The improved force fields for IDPs are highly favorable
for ensemble construction and drug design targeting IDPs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically analyzed
the conservation of
potentially druggable cavities of IDPs from the pE-DB dataset. Although
IDPs lack rigid structures and exist in highly dynamic conformational
ensembles, there is considerable conservation for their potentially
druggable cavities. For example, the predicted binding pKd has a narrow range between 5.81 and 6.99, and the average
common atom percentage can reach 54%. The rmsd is in the range of
1–8 Å for multichain systems, and direct alignment shows
that a common binding pocket is usually exposed. In addition, the
ensembles with partial-ordered structure were compared with the IDPs,
concluding that the pcommon and rmsd of
potentially druggable cavities for partially ordered ensembles are
similar with that for IDPs. We also calculated the conservation of
binding pockets in IDP c-Myc370–409 that have been
experimentally proved getting inhibitors by a virtual screen, whose pcommon and rmsd are consistent with the results
we analyzed in other systems. This work leads to optimism of attempt
for rational drug design, targeting the disordered region of proteins.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Datasets
pE-DB
(http://pedb.vib.be) is an openly
accessible
database for the deposition of structural ensembles of IDPs based
on NMR, SAXS, and other data measured in solution.34 Each ensemble in pE-DB is composed of a high number (dozens
to hundreds or even more) of conformations, which provides a large
number of samples to analyze the conservation of potentially druggable
cavities. We analyzed all 24 entities (ensembles) of pE-DB but discarded
six of them (1AAB, 3AAD, 4AAD, 5AAD, 6AAD, and 9AAA) because they had
too few potentially druggable cavities to analyze any possible conservation.
We also incorporated c-Myc into the dataset. C-Myc is a transcription
factor that is activated upon dimer formation with its partner protein
Max and is expressed constitutively in most cancer cells.25 Large-scale MD simulations have been conducted
to determine the ensemble of c-Myc370–409, where
the conformations are highly diverse.20 In total, the main dataset we used contains 19 entries and are listed
in Table 1.

Disprot-pdb
is another source of IDP structures, which was constructed by combining
the information from the database of protein disorder (DisProt)41 and the protein data bank (PDB).42 The disorder percentage of proteins in DisProt
ranges from 0 to 100%, and the structures solved in the PDB may belong
to either ordered or disordered regions of the proteins. For analysis,
our Disprot-pdb dataset is constructed by selecting proteins with
more than 10 conformations and 50% of solved residues in the PDB structure-labeled
disordered in DisProt (listed in Table 2). However, many entries in Disprot-pdb have too few
potentially druggable cavities to enable the conservation analysis.
As a result, only three systems from Disprot-pdb are briefly discussed
in Figure 8.

It is noted that the available ensemble data of IDPs are usually
less accurate than the structure data of ordered proteins. Generating
reliable disordered ensembles is a notoriously difficult problem because
of the inherent underdetermined nature of the problem. It is still
impossible to accurately determine protein structural ensembles from
the available experimental data, for example, NMR spectroscopy and
SAXS data. As a result, the available ensembles of IDPs inevitably
contain systematic bias/artifacts depending on the structural calculation
algorithms, the experimental data used, and molecular models employed
in structural generation. This large uncertainty may lead to misleading
observations on some specific systems, such that some IDPs appear
to contain more conserved cavities, whereas others do not. In this
sense, the determined globally average properties would be relatively
more reliable than those for specific systems because the uncertainty
is reduced in averaging over all ensembles. On the other hand, in
a prospective view, by exploiting the growing amount of available
structural data and the increasingly accurate force fields as a priori
knowledge40 and combining emerging experimental
and computational approaches,43 it will
progressively enable reliable quantification of structural ensembles
of IDPs.44 Last, considering that drug
design targeting IDPs is still in its infancy, any revealed insights
on the druggability of IDPs would be useful even if they are not as
accurate as those for ordered proteins.

4.2 Cavity
Calculations
The druggability
analysis is an important step in a drug discovery project.32,45,46 We used the program CAVITY developed
by Yuan et al.31 to predict druggable cavities
in the protein surface. Here, we provide a very brief introduction
on CAVITY for the convenience of audiences. More details can be found
from the original paper of Yuan et al.31,47

CAVITY
searches the cavities through the following approach: (1) mesh the
space occupied by the whole protein molecule (default length 0.5 Å,
which is less than ∼2 Å resolution of crystal structure)
with 3D grids; (2) identify the characteristics (i.e., occupied, nonoccupied,
and boundary) of each grid points by a water molecule (radius 1.4
Å) rolling the surface of protein; (3) erase all of the nonoccupied
lattices accessible using a sphere with a default radius of 10 Å;
(4) a shrink-and-expansion algorithm is carried out to separate conjoint
cavities and remove improper cavities, where any cavities with maximum
depth greater than the “maximal joint depth” are subject
to separation, and too shallow cavities are discarded.

After
cavities were detected, CAVITY evaluates their druggability
based on their geometrical structure and physical chemistry properties.
Three kinds of probe atoms are used to identify the physical–chemical
properties of grid points: sp3-N as hydrogen bonds donor,
sp2-O as hydrogen bond receptor, and sp3-C as
hydrophobic group. The interaction between the probe and the protein
is evaluated using the SCORE algorithm by Wang et al.48 Finally, various characteristics of cavities are identified:
volume, surface area, maximum depth, hydrophobic surface, edge layer
area, and the areas of the hydrogen bond donor and receptor. A predicted
pKd (the potential binding affinity of
the cavity with properly designed ligands) and a CavityDrugScore were
calculated from the characteristics whose formulas have been optimized
based on some training datasets. It is noted that the induced-fit
effect and the entropy effect were not considered in CAVITY, which
may decrease the actual pKd of IDPs because
the binding effect of a small molecule would be partially compensated
by the conformational adjustment of IDPs.49 According to the obtained CavityDrugScore, detected cavities are
classified by CAVITY into three categories: druggable (CavityDrugScore
≥ 600), amphibious (−180 < CavityDrugScore < 600),
and undruggable (CavityDrugScore ≤ −180). In this article,
only predicted druggable cavities were further analyzed.

To
measure the cavity shape, we refer to the algorithms in geography
and use the Boyce–Clark figure factor,35,36 as given in eq 1 by
flattening the cavity vacant along the maximum depth (z) direction into a two-dimensional shape. The conservation of potentially
druggable cavities was further measured by the common atom percentage
and rmsd as described here. For a particular potentially druggable
cavity (i) in an ensemble, we selected a cavity (j) from each conformation (J) that has
the highest common atom percentage with i among all
cavities of the conformation J, whereas the comparisons
between other cavities and the cavity i are omitted.
After calculating the common atom percentage, we extracted the coordinates
of the common atoms between cavity i and each of
these picked cavities j and calculate their rmsds.
Conservation is higher when the average common atom percentage is
large and the average rmsd is small.
