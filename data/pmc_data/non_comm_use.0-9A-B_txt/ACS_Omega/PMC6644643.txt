The
wettability of customized Li–O2 battery electrodes
is altered by mixing acetylene black carbon particles with various
binders. The wettability of the electrode can be characterized by
the static contact angles between the electrode surface and nonaqueous
electrolyte, which is 1 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium
salt (LiTFSI) dissolved in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and
the double-layer capacitance measured by the cyclic voltammetry. Results
show that electrodes containing poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)
binder are lyophilic and increasing the fraction of poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) increases the lyophobicity of electrodes. Li–O2 batteries are discharged at 0.1 mA/cm2 with the cut-off
voltage of 2.0 V. The discharge capacity of the electrode with 15%
PVDF (36.5°) carbon coatings is 1665.8 mAh/g, whereas the customized
electrode with 15% PTFE (128.4°) carbon coatings obtains the
discharge capacity of 4160.8 mAh/g. However, the discharge capacity
decreases to 3109.5 and 2822.9 mAh/g as the PTFE content further increases
to 25% (135.5°) and 35% (138.5°), respectively. The electrode
composed of two lyophobic carbon coatings on top and bottom and one
lyophilic carbon coating in the middle has the static contact angle
of 118.8° and acquires the highest specific discharge capacity
of 5149.5 mAh/g.

1 Introduction
Greenhouse
gas emissions from the production and consumption of
fossil fuels have resulted in global climate change, acid rain, as
well as other environmental consequences, which attract growing concerns
from the world. Thus, renewable energy is emerging and thriving globally
to replace the fossil fuels. However, the lower energy density and
intermittency of renewable energy, such as solar energy and wind energy,
limit their commercialization.1 Currently,
the rechargeable battery is considered as one of the compromising
technologies to efficiently store renewable energy. Among rechargeable
batteries, the Li-ion battery has achieved a great success and has
been widely applied in many devices and instruments, including mobile
phones and electrical vehicles.2 The practical
specific energy of the Li-ion battery (∼200 Wh/kg), however,
has already approached the theoretical specific energy (∼600
Wh/kg).3

The Li–air battery
using O2 from the atmosphere
displays a much higher theoretical energy density (∼11 000
Wh/kg based on Li anode) than other rechargeable batteries.4 However, many obstacles, such as the low discharge–charge
current rate, low charge discharge energy efficiency, and poor cycle
life need to be overcome to commercialize the Li–air battery.5,6 Since CO2 and H2O in air would react with
active components in batteries and deteriorate the performance, most
laboratory experiments were conducted under pure O2 environment.7,8 Experiments in this study has utilized pure O2 so that
the term Li–O2 battery is presented throughout this
paper. Generally, a rechargeable Li–O2 battery using
organic electrolyte consists of a lithium metal anode, a separator
saturated with the organic electrolyte, and a porous cathode electrode
(typically made from carbon or catalysts). The electrochemical reactions
occurring on the anode and cathode as well as the overall reaction
are shown below. The reversible cell voltage is 2.96 V.9 1   2   3  During the discharge operation, the Li metal
is oxidized at the anode to generate lithium ion that transfers through
the separator and reaches the porous cathode. The lithium ion reacts
with oxygen from the ambient or gas channels and generates lithium
peroxide (Li2O2) at the cathode. The oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) should occur both on triphase boundaries
formed by the electrode material, the electrolyte and oxygen, as well
as the interface of electrode material and electrolyte. The charging
reactions at the anode and cathode are reversed from discharging reactions
in which lithium peroxide is decomposed and oxygen is released at
the cathode and lithium metal is deposited at the anode.

The
O2 diffusion in the porous cathode is a key factor
that determines the discharge capacity of Li–O2 batteries.10,11 Therefore, many studies on Li–O2 batteries have
paid considerable attention to the O2 diffusion in the
porous cathode because poor O2 diffusion will reduce the
capacity. The O2 diffusion in the porous cathode is related
to carbon loading,12 pore clogging induced
by the deposition of solid lithium peroxide,13−16 and the partial pressure of oxygen.17 In addition, the wettability between the electrolyte
and electrode also significantly affects the performance of Li–O2 batteries because the O2 diffusion coefficient
in air is several orders of magnitude higher than that in the liquid
electrolyte. For instance, the O2 diffusion coefficient18 in nonaqueous electrolyte calculated by the
Stokes–Einstein equation is on the order of 10–6, whereas the diffusion coefficient is on the order of 10–2 in air.19 The contact angle is often
applied to characterize the wetting behavior between the liquid and
solid surface. The electrolyte and carbon material in electrode possess
different dielectric constants, which affect the wettability of the
solid to the liquid. The contact angle of the electrolyte on the surface
of carbon electrode increases when the difference of dielectric constant
between the electrolyte and carbon electrode is larger. The electrolyte
with a larger contact angle is less likely to wet the carbon electrode.
Xu et al.20 showed that the wettability
affected the O2 diffusion in the porous electrode and thus
the discharge and charge capacities. The measured contact angles of
1 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) in various
nonaqueous solvents and their mixtures on the surface of both carbon
and Teflon showed that the discharge capacity was improved when the
contact angle increased. For example, the contact angle of 1 M LiTFSI
in propylene carbonate (PC)/ethylene carbonate (EC) (1:1 wt) on the
surface of carbon was 47°, whereas that of 1 M LiTFSI in PC/dimethoxyethane
(DME) (1:1 wt) on the surface of carbon was 5°. The discharge
capacity with the PC/EC solvent was 167.5 mAh/g, whereas the capacity
was only 27.4 mAh/g with the PC/DME solvent. Binders such as poly(vinylidene
difluoride) (PVDF) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) are used to
combine different types of small particles together and adjust the
wettability of cathode electrode in Li–O2 batteries.
Zhang et al.21 investigated the wettability
of carbon electrodes using the electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in PC/EC with a weight ratio of 1:1. The electrode made from Super
P carbon mixed with PTFE (8:2 wt) had the contact angle of 99°,
whereas the electrode made from KB 600 carbon mixed with PTFE (8:2
wt) had the contact angle of 56°. The battery with lyophobic
electrode obtained a higher discharge capacity (3175 mAh/g) than the
battery with a lyophilic electrode (798 mAh/g).

On the other
hand, strongly lyophobic electrodes may deteriorate
the discharge–charge performance. The Li–O2 battery using lyophobic electrode was researched by Chen et al.,22 in which the experimental data showed that the
specific discharge capacity increased from 1365 to 2365 mAh/g when
the PTFE weight ratio increased from 0 to 30%. However, the electrode
composed of 40 wt % PTFE deteriorated the performance of Li–O2 battery such that the specific discharge capacity decreased
to 2130 mAh/g. The PTFE weight ratio should be optimized because a
higher PTFE content will reduce the amounts of triphase boundaries
for the electrochemical reactions battery electrode. The contact angles
of water on the surface of raw carbon paper and carbon paper with
30 wt % PTFE were measured to be 136.6 and 148.3°, respectively.
It should be noted that the water and liquid electrolytes have very
different dielectric constants: the dielectric constant of water is
78.323 at 25 °C, whereas that of tetraethylene
glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) is 7.9.24 Therefore, the contact angle measured by water cannot represent
the surface wettability between electrode and liquid electrolyte.

Because of the significantly different O2 diffusivity
in gas phase and electrolyte phase, electrodes with mixed wettability
could create triphase boundaries that facilitate the oxygen transfer
through gas phase (nonwetted pores). However, too many nonwetted pores
will decrease the ionic conductivity of electrodes. Therefore, this
study has conducted a systematic investigation on the effects of wettability
of electrodes toward organic electrolyte (including both lyophilicity
and lyophobicity) and its effects on the deep discharge capacity of
Li–O2 battery. The wettability of electrode was
adjusted by mixing carbon powders with different binders (PTFE and
PVDF) at various weight ratios. The stability of binders has been
systematically examined25 in the presence
of commercial Li2O2, which showed that PVDF
was unstable because of the presence of highly electron-withdrawing
functional groups and an α or β hydrogen atom next to
them. The PTFE binder was demonstrated to be stable in the presence
of Li2O2. In addition, the PVDF binder was confirmed
to degrade in Li–O2 batteries.26 The products formed in the PVDF degradation was measured
by Raman spectroscopy and showed the Raman shifts of ∼1123
and 1525 cm–1. However, the degradation can be prevented
by drying the electrode under higher temperature, such as 200 °C.
Thus, the stability of PTFE and PVDF binders can be guaranteed in
this study if the electrodes are prepared according to the process
in Experimental Section. The wettability of
various customized electrodes was indicated by the contact angles
of 1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME electrolyte on the customized electrode surface
as well as the double-layer capacitance, which is proportional to
the area of wetted pore surface in the electrode.27 After comparing the specific discharge capacities of electrodes
with lyophilic and lyophobic carbon coating layers, the electrodes
consisting of mixed coating layers were produced and tested to optimize
the discharge–charge performance. The study shed light on the
criteria to improve the O2 diffusion and increase the specific
discharge capacity of Li–O2 batteries.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Initial Deep Discharge
All these
customized electrodes are tested by the deep discharge experiments
at the current density of 0.1 mA/cm2. The discharge capacity
of raw carbon cloth is negligible (<100 mAh/g) due to the low specific
surface area. Therefore, the reported specific discharge capacity
is calculated on the basis of the weight of carbon powders coated
on the electrode without considering the weight of raw carbon cloth
substrate and binders. The discharge curves with the highest discharge
capacity among three repeated experiments of each electrode are shown
in Figure 1, and the
discharge capacities are compared in Figure 2. The lowest specific discharge capacity
of 1665.8 mA/h g is achieved by the electrode with 15% PVDF carbon
coatings. When the PTFE binder is used in the customized electrode,
the electrode becomes more lyophobic. The specific discharge capacities
of Li–O2 batteries increase from 3145.8 to 4160.8
mAh/g when the mass fraction of PTFE binder increases from 5 to 15%
but decreases to 3109.5 and 2822.9 mAh/g when the mass fraction of
PTFE binder further increases to 25 and 35%. The significant variation
of specific discharge capacity can be attributed to the wettability
change. To quantitatively correlate the discharge capacity with the
electrode wettability, both the static contact angle and the double-layer
capacitance of customized electrodes are measured and exhibited.

curves of Li–O2 batteries with
customized electrodes.

Figure 2 Deep discharge Li–O2 batteries using customized
electrode.

2.2 Contact
Angle Measurement
The static
contact angle between electrolyte and electrode surface is measured
to indicate the surface wettability difference among customized electrodes
with various contents of PTFE and PVDF binders. Instead of measuring
contact angle between a water drop and electrode surface,22 the 1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME electrolyte (5 μL
per drop) is dropped on the surface of customized electrodes to measure
the static contact angle. The measured static contact angles (<90°
for lyophilic surface and >90° for lyophobic surface) as well
as images of electrolyte drops on electrode surfaces are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Results of static contact
angle measurements on customized electrode
surface.

The measurement of static contact
angle is unsuccessful when the
electrolyte drop is dripped on the surface of customized electrode
containing 5% PTFE because the electrolyte droplet quickly spreads
into the electrode. It indicates that the surface of 5% PTFE is lyophilic
and is more easily wetted by the electrolyte. When the PTFE content
increases from 15 to 35%, the electrode becomes more lyophobic and
the static contact angle increases from 128.4 to 138.5°. The
mixed I electrode, which consists of one 15% PVDF coating sandwiched
by two 15% PTFE coatings, displays a slightly lower static contact
angle (118.8°) than the electrode with 15% PTFE. It may be caused
by the fact that a small amount of PVDF binder is mixed on the top
layer of carbon coating during the fabrication. In addition, the contact
angles of customized electrodes with 15% PVDF carbon coatings as well
as the mixed II electrode consisting of one 15% PTFE carbon coating
sandwiched by two 15% PVDF carbon coatings are less than 90°
and are unstable.

2.3 Double-Layer Capacitance
Measurement
Since static contact angles represent the surface
rather than internal
wettability of customized electrodes, the double-layer capacitance
of customized electrodes is also measured. This study employs an electrochemical
approach27 to quantify the solid–liquid
interfacial area and promote the understanding of wettability within
customized electrodes. The electric double layer is created on the
electrode surface that is wetted by the electrolyte because the customized
electrode made of carbon powders is electrically conductive. The double-layer
capacitance is related to the wetted interfacial area via the following
equation 4  where C is the capacitance,
εr is the relative permittivity of the electrolyte,
ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, d is the double-layer thickness, which can be approximated as Debye
length, and Asl represents the wetted
pore surface. For an electrolyte with the given composition measured
at the room temperature, parameters of εr, ε0, and d can be considered as constants. Therefore,
the change of the area of the wetted pore surface is proportional
to the variation of the double-layer capacitance.

Figure 4 exhibits the relationship
between the volume of added electrolyte and the measured double-layer
capacitance. Considering the battery frame shown in Figure 8, the double-layer capacitance
is related to the wetted pore surface in the electrode as well as
the wetted area in the current collector. Thus, it is necessary to
measure the capacitance when only the strongly lyophilic separator
is inserted in the battery. Generally, as more electrolyte is added,
more pore surface is wetted so that the double-layer capacitance increases.
The customized electrode containing 15% PVDF has larger capacitances
than that with 35% PTFE because the former electrode is more lyophilic
and more pores are wetted by electrolyte. For example, the capacitance
of the electrode with 15% PVDF was 12.9 μF more than that of
the electrode with 35% PTFE at the volume of 20 μL. The capacitance
of 35%-PTFE electrode combined with the separator is only slightly
higher (<5 μF in all volumetric cases) than that of a single
separator, as shown in Figure 4. It indicates that most of the electrolyte added into the
lyophobic electrode is repelled into the lyophilic separator. The
double-layer capacitance increases almost linearly with the amount
of added electrolyte when the electrolyte is less than 60 μL.
As the electrolyte is added, more electrolyte spreads into the separator.
Therefore, the wetted surface in the current collector may account
for a larger fraction of the double-layer capacitance. The sudden
rise in the capacitance after 100 μL may be attributed to the
fact that electrolyte is squeezed out from the battery frame and the
extra double layer is created. Although the compression during battery
assembly may partially compensate the capillary pressure within the
electrode and cause measuring errors, especially when the electrolyte
was more than 60 μL, the measurement of double-layer capacitance
demonstrates the general trend that more pores are wetted by the electrolyte
in the lyophilic electrodes.

Figure 4 Double-layer capacitance vs volume of electrolyte
added on the
customized electrode.

2.4 Discussion
More lyophobic electrodes
facilitate O2 diffusion by creating more gas paths. The
improvement of O2 transfer results in a higher specific
discharge capacity. However, the specific discharge capacity of the
electrode decreases after further increasing the PTFE content to more
than 15%. The influences of PTFE content on specific discharge capacity
possesses good consistency with the published data.22 Further increasing the PTFE content generates more lyophobic
pores that reduce the number of triphase boundaries for the ORR reaction
and decreases the ionic conductivity. In Figure 5, the equivalent resistance measured by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) mainly includes the electronic resistance
of the electrodes, current collectors, and ionic resistance of the
electrolyte, as well as the contact resistance between these components.
All electrodes are tested in the same battery frame design with the
same electrolyte. Therefore, variations of the equivalent resistance
can be attributed to changes of the ionic resistance. More lyophobic
electrode impedes the ionic transfer by decreasing the ionic conductivity.
The resistance displays the same trend as the static contact angle.
In addition, the unstable discharge curves at the end of discharging
process imply that lyophobic electrodes still experience O2 starvation on cathode, which increases the overpotential and causes
the sudden death of the battery.

Figure 5 Equivalent ionic resistance of the batteries
with customized electrode
of different wettabilities.

To facilitate the oxygen diffusion without significantly
sacrificing
the ionic conductivity, electrodes with mixed wettability have been
designed and tested. The mixed electrode structures shown in Figure 1c,d consist of three
carbon coatings. In mixed I electrode, the top and bottom layers with
15% PTFE are lyophobic and the middle layer with 15% PVDF is lyophilic.
The battery with mixed I electrode achieves the highest specific discharge
capacity of 5149.5 mAh/g. Because of the lyophobicity of both the
top and the bottom coatings, O2 can diffuse into the electrode
without much diffusion resistance and reach the electrolyte that accumulates
in the lyophilic coating in the middle. This design utilizes the porous
structure inside the electrode more effectively. Also, adding a lyophilic
layer in the middle of electrode may reduce the O2 diffusion
length compared with the fully lyophobic electrode. The combined effects
lead to the highest specific capacity. In comparison, the mixed II
electrode is composed of one carbon coating with 15% PTFE layer sandwiched
by two carbon coatings with 15% PVDF. This electrode only results
in 2700.6 mAh/g deep discharge capacity because the lyophilic top
and bottom layers impose more resistance in O2 diffusion.
Comparing with the electrode with 15% PVDF, applying one lyophobic
layer in the middle of mixed II electrode increases the discharge
capacity by about 1000 mAh/g. The result is consistent with the previous
conclusion as well as the study conducted by Xia et al.28 that partially wetted electrodes perform better
than electrodes fully saturated by the electrolyte. The mixed I customized
electrode with stacking coatings (lyophobic coatings on top and bottom
with a lyophilic coating in the middle) can be beneficial to promote
the design of air electrodes and provide a valuable reference to fabricate
high-capacity electrodes.

2.5 Discharge–Charge
Cycle
Although
this study is focusing on the deep discharge capacity of Li–O2 batteries with customized electrodes, the cycling performance
is also investigated and analyzed. The first discharge–charge
cycles of Li–O2 batteries with customized electrodes
at 0.1 mA/cm2 are shown in Figure 6. The cut-off voltage of charge is set as
4.5 V. The mixed I 15% electrode as well as PTFE 15% electrode result
in a discharge–charge cycle with the average coulombic efficiency
close to 85%, whereas the battery with 15% PVDF achieves a slightly
higher coulombic efficiency of 93%. The lower coulombic efficiencies
of mixed I 15% electrode and PTFE 15% electrode can be contributed
to the fact that more electrolyte in the lyophobic electrode evaporates
because of much longer discharge and charge time, which may increase
the ionic resistance during charge and thus deteriorate the coulombic
efficiency.29 Besides, PVDF favors the
thin Li2O2 film formed on the surface of electrode,
whereas PTFE results in more Li2O2 toroids,
which are more difficult to decompose during charging.30 The cycling performance of Li–O2 batteries with PTFE 15% electrodes is also studied with the cut-off
capacity of 1000 mAh/g. Figure 7 shows that coulombic efficiency is more than 90% in the first
nine cycles and the discharge–charge curves are shown in Figure S4. The cycling performance of Li–O2 batteries using customized electrodes is validated. Further
study will focus on optimizing the design of customized electrode
since the rational structure can increase the cycle life of Li–O2 batteries.31,32

3 Conclusions
The wettability of electrode was mainly altered by mixing acetylene
black carbons with PTFE and/or PVDF binders at various weight ratios.
The customized electrodes containing PVDF binder or less PTFE binder
(<15%) were lyophilic, and their corresponding discharge capacities
were lower than those of lyophobic electrodes. The electrode with
15% PTFE exhibited the deep discharge capacity of 4160.8 mAh/g because
lyophobic electrode provided more gas path for O2 diffusion.
This study also designed customized electrodes with stacked layers
by combining the lyophilic layers with lyophobic layers. The mixed
I electrode (15% PTFE carbon coatings on top and bottom, one 15% PVDF
carbon coating in the middle) showed the highest deep discharge capacity
of 5149.5 mAh/g among all of the experimental cases. The mixed wettability
promoted the oxygen diffusion without significantly lowering the ionic
conductivity or reducing the number of reaction sites. Therefore,
configuring the wettability in the electrode design is an important
direction to increase the discharge capacity of Li–O2 batteries. Further study may focus on improving the configuration
of customized electrode wettability considering the spatial distribution
of pore size31 and specific pore volume
of various carbon powders.

4 Experimental Section

The electrolyte was prepared in a glovebox with <1 ppm water and
<5 ppm oxygen. The electrolyte salt, LiTFSI (99.95%), from Sigma-Aldrich,
was dissolved in TEGDME and the concentration was 1 mol/L.

4.2 Air Cathode Preparation
AvCarb 1071
HCB plain carbon cloth fabric purchased from Fuel Cell Store was used
as the substrate of the customized cathode electrode on cathode. Conductive
acetylene black (purchased from MTI Corporation) mixed with various
weight ratios of PTFE was dissolved in the ethanol solution to form
the carbon slurry. The substrate carbon cloth was dipped into the
carbon slurry and dried in the atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the electrode
was heat-treated at 350 °C for 30 min. The electrodes with customized
coatings of 5, 15, 25, and 35% (in weight) of PTFE were obtained.
In addition, electrodes with 15% PVDF carbon coatings and electrodes
with mixed carbon coatings (both 15% PTFE and 15% PVDF) were prepared
following the same procedure aforementioned. The schematic views on
the structure of the customized electrodes are displayed in Figure 8. The targeted carbon loadings of all customized electrodes
were 2 mg/cm2. The measured carbon loadings of the fabricated
electrodes were 2.1 ± 0.1 mg/cm2.

4.3 Battery
Assembly
The battery was
constructed by sandwiching the oxygen diffuser, customized cathode
electrode, separator, and lithium chip in the battery frame shown
in Figure 9(29) The battery frame was customer-designed and
made from highly corrosion-resistant grade 2 titanium. The open ratio
of oxygen diffuser was 50% and the separator was a Whatman GF/B glass
fiber filter from Fisher Scientific with the diameter of 2.1 cm. The
lithium chip with the diameter of 1.56 cm was purchased from MTI Corporation.
The PTFE gasket and O-ring purchased from McMaster-Carr were inserted
to prevent oxygen leaking. All batteries were assembled in the glovebox
by adding 60 μL of electrolyte in the separator and in the cathode
electrode. The substrate layer faced the O2 side and the
1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME electrolyte was added on the coating layer.

4.4 Wettability
Measurements
The contact
angles between 1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME and surfaces of customized electrodes
were measured using ramé-hart Model 190 contact angle goniometer
at the room temperature. The static contact angle, which can be maintained
for 120 s during measurement, was used to characterize the surface
wettability. Each measurement was conducted at three different locations
on the surface of customized electrodes using 5 μL of electrolyte
drops. Double-layer capacitance measurement was carried out by the
cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests with SP 150 potentiostat from BioLogic
Science Instrument. The experimental setup was the same as the battery
assembly in the discharge experiment. The 1 M LiTFSI/TEGDME electrolyte
was added on the surface of the electrode by a pipette. All CV measurements
were performed from −0.2 to 0.2 V at the scanning rate of 0.2
V/s and repeated at least three times. The EIS data were analyzed
by the EC Lab software (V11.02).

4.5 Deep
Discharge Measurements
Assembled
batteries were connected to a four-channel Arbin MSTAT4 battery tester.
The pure oxygen was supplied at a flow rate of 0.3 sccm, and the pressure
of the pure oxygen was maintained at 10 kPa gauge pressure. After
resting for 1 h, deep discharge tests were conducted at room temperature
and repeated at least three times.18 First
discharge–charge cycles of Li–O2 batteries
with Mixed I, 15% PTFE and 15% PVDF carbon coatings, were also tested
and analyzed.
