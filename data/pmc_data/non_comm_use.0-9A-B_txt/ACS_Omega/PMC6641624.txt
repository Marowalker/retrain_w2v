Squalene is selectively and entirely
converted into squalane over
the spherical sol–gel-entrapped Pd catalyst SiliaCat Pd(0) under solvent-free and mild reaction conditions of 3 bar H2 and 70 °C. The catalyst was reused successfully in eight
consecutive cycles, with palladium leaching values <2 ppm, opening
the route to sustainable and less-expensive hydrogenation of phytosqualene
with important sustainability consequences.

Introduction
Obtained
by full hydrogenation of the highly unsaturated all-(E) linear terpenoid squalene ((6E,10E,14E,18E)-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosa-2,6,10,14,18,22-hexaene),
an immune system stimulant and anticarcinogenic and antioxidant agent
widely used in traditional medicine and nutraceutical products,1 squalane (C30H62) is a
clear and nonirritant oil widely and increasingly employed by the
cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries.2 For example, thanks to its exceptional capacity
to penetrate and impart flexibility to the human skin, as well as
to vehiculate and increase the absorption of other active substances,3 squalane is used to formulate top cosmetic products
including creams, hair conditioners, lotions, lipsticks, sunscreens,
bath oils, and foundations. Today, this valued substance is mainly
derived from vegetable sources including olive oil (46% of the overall
market share in 2015)4 and biotechnology
squalene from sugarcane (10%), even though a significant fraction
(40%) is still obtained from deep sea shark liver oil (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Squalene Purity and
Composition Issues, Depending on Its Origin
Sugarcane squalene is obtained via Pd-catalyzed dimerization
of
sesquiterpene (E)-β-farnesene derived from
sucrose fermentation over genetically engineered strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,5 affording a consistent composition of 94% phytosqualane along with
3.5% isosqualane and 2.5% monocyclosqualane.6Table 1 summarizes
the advantages and disadvantages of heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation
processes carried out in industry over the commonly used supported
metal catalysts.

Accounting for about
40% of the overall production cost,7 the
squalene hydrogenation process is carried
out over nickel-kieselguhr catalyst under the solvent-free reaction
conditions of 4 bar H2 at 200 °C8 or over more costly Pd/C of 70 bar H2 at 160
°C. In the former case, extensive leaching of Ni requires prolonged
purification of the hydrogenated product over silica and other adsorbent
materials to meet the maximum acceptable levels of highly toxic nickel
compounds (Ni2+ and Ni0) in a cosmetic product
(0.2 ppm). In the latter, the surface-derivatized nature of conventional
commercial Pd/C catalyst leads to a rapid decrease in the catalytic
performance.9 Furthermore, if squalene
originating from olive oil is used,10 the
inevitable presence of residual waxes requires first a “winterization”
step to precipitate wax, followed by hydrogenation in two steps: first
under 5 bar of H2 pressure for 3–4 h, followed by
another 3 h at 30 bar H2 to afford complete saturation.

We recently reported that the heterogeneous hydrogenation of squalene
dissolved in ethanol over SiliaCat Pd(0) selectively
affords high yields of squalane using an ultralow amount of palladium
loading (0.02 mmol/g of squalene) under remarkably mild conditions
(1 bar H2 30 °C, or 50 °C when shorter reaction
times are needed).15 Comprising organosilica
catalyst doped with Pd(0) nanocrystals, the catalyst is reusable,
with hydrogenation of a lesser pure olive oil squalene (82 wt %) requiring
somewhat harsher reaction conditions.

Shortly afterwards, Soni
and Sharma in India reported the excellent
performance of a Pd/clay catalyst under solvent-free conditions at
200 °C under 4 bar H2.16 Complete conversion of squalene to squalane was achieved after 6
h with a Pd loading of approximately 0.06 mmol/g of squalene. Under
the said optimized reaction conditions, the catalyst was remarkably
stable and an ultralow amount of Pd leached into the product (0.0311
ppm), which established the best squalene hydrogenation catalyst ever
reported. Now, we show how the full hydrogenation of all-E linear squalene into valued squalane is achieved over the spherical
sol–gel-entrapped Pd catalyst SiliaCat Pd(0)
under solvent-free and mild reaction conditions (3 bar H2 and 70 °C) over a 0.2 mol % Pd loading in the form of 2.5 wt
% SiliaCat Pd(0) catalyst (Scheme 2) using two squalenes of a different origin
and purity.

Scheme 2 Solvent-Free Hydrogenation of Squalene over SiliaCat Pd(0) under Optimized Reaction Conditions
The catalyst is extensively
reusable, with palladium leaching values
<2 ppm, opening the route to an easier and low-cost hydrogenation
of squalene.

Results and Discussion
SiliaCat Pd(0) is a heterogeneous catalyst obtained
via the alcohol-free sol–gel polycondensation of alkoxysilanes
such as methyltrimethoxysilane (MTES).17 The hydrophobic character of the organosilica support protects the
Pd nanoparticles (NPs) against oxidation, increases the stability
against moisture, and increases the catalytic activity of the catalyst
under mild conditions.18,19

Following advances anticipated
in 2011 for which the spherical
morphology of the silica microparticles could be beneficial to catalysis,20 the catalyst is now available in spherical morphology
(Figure 1, left).

Figure 1 Scanning
electron microscopy (left) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (right) images of SiliaCat Pd(0) spherical
palladium catalyst used throughout this study.

The newly prepared catalyst comprises catalytically active
Pd0 NPs encapsulated within a spherical mesoporous organically
modified silica matrix. The presence of highly dispersed average 3.1
nm palladium NPs was clearly revealed by the TEM analysis (Figure 1, right). The crystalline
nature of the active nanophase is evident from the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the catalyst powder (Figure 2, right) characteristic of the face-centered
cubic (fcc) structure of metallic Pd for which a typical 2.6 nm crystal
domain was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation21 from the line broadening of majority (111) reflections
(Table 2).

the Pd/MeSiO1.5 catalyst (Figure 3, right) has a lower BET surface area (average
400 m2/g) and a broader pore size distribution centered
at 8.0 nm.

organotrialkoxysilanes for which the Si atoms appear as Tn bands type, where n is the number

absence of any signal at −40 ppm related to ethoxy groups derived
from nonhydrolyzed MTES and the presence of signals only at −56
ppm (T2, MeSi(OSi)2OH) and −66 ppm (T3, MeSi(OSi)3) correspond to almost complete hydrolysis
of the MTES organosiloxane precursor.24

analysis.

c Leaching of Pd
and Si was assessed
by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
analysis in 1,1,2-trichloroethane.26

d Sixteen hours reaction time.

First, entries 2–8 in Table 4 show that in each
case the experimental values of
leached Pd (and Si) in the crude product were <2 ppm (threshold
value for palladium in oils for cosmetic and food products in the
United States).

Entries 1 and 2 show that the hydrogenation
of high-purity squalene
with complete conversion and 99% squalane selectivity was smoothly
achieved at 70 °C after 24 h reaction. However, entry 3 shows
that when squalene obtained from olive oil in 82 wt % purity was used
in place of pure squalene, the substrate conversion into squalane
was only 39%. Furthermore, entries 3–8 show evidence that the
hydrogenation of olive oil-derived squalene requires harsher conditions
than that of pure squalene, with temperature having a crucial effect.
Rise in the temperature from 70 to 180 °C increases the selectivity
in squalane from 39 to 100%. At 150 °C and under 3 bar H2, the conversion of olive oil squalene to squalane with 98%
selectivity was achieved after 24 h (entry 7). At 180 °C, however,
complete conversion was obtained after only 16 h (entry 8).

Squalene conversion and selectivity to squalane were calculated
and plotted against the reaction temperature (Figure 5) revealing the dependence of squalane selectivity
on the latter parameter.

Figure 5 Effect of temperature in hydrogenation of olive
squalene (82 wt
% purity).

Effect of H2 Pressure
To study the effect
of hydrogen pressure on the solvent-free catalytic hydrogenation of
olive squalene (82% pure) over 0.2 mol % Pd, the H2 pressure
was increased from 3 to 20 bar and the conversion of squalene to squalane
at 180 °C was evaluated at different reaction times (Table 5).

b Squalene
conversion/squalane selectivity
evaluated by GC–MS analysis.

From the data in Table 5, the values for squalane conversion and selectivity
after
4, 7, and 16 h were calculated and plotted against the H2 pressure (Figure 6), revealing the dependence of squalane selectivity on the H2 pressure.

Figure 6 Effect of hydrogen pressure on hydrogenation of 82% pure
olive
oil squalene.

Figure 6 shows that
after 4 h, raising the H2 pressure from 3 to 20 bar improves
the squalane selectivity from 30 to 98%. Similarly, after 7 h reaction
time, bringing the hydrogen pressure to 20 bar enhances the squalane
selectivity from slightly more than 50% to complete selectivity with
the full conversion of squalene over a very low Pd loading (0.005
mmol Pd/g of substrate).

After 16 h and at 180 °C, complete
conversion of olive oil
squalene to squalane was obtained at all of the H2 pressures
applied (3, 6, and 10 bar). The effect of the hydrogen pressure suggests
that, as expected from a truly heterogeneous reaction involving a
solid (the catalyst) and a gaseous reactant (H2), the rate
of reaction is strongly dependent on the solubility of the hydrogen
in the reaction mixture over the range of pressure studied. The hydrogen
pressure impacts directly on the H2 diffusion through the
gas and liquid films at the bubble–liquid interface and therefore
the diffusion through the bulk liquid phase and the liquid film at
the liquid–solid interface, as well as the reaction rate on
the catalytic solid surface. A high reaction pressure also affects
the kinetics of squalene adsorption and squalane desorption from the
Pd0 NPs (the GC–MS analysis clearly showed a fast
primary hydrogenation of squalene even after 4 h, revealing the presence
of intermediate partially hydrogenated products of squalene).

Effect
of Catalyst Loading
Table 6 shows the results obtained by varying the
reaction palladium loading using once again 82 wt % olive oil-derived
squalene under different reaction conditions. Entry 1 displays that
over 0.5 mol % Pd catalyst, corresponding to 0.012 mmol Pd entrapped
in SiliaCat Pd(0) per gram of squalene, the substrate
conversion to squalane at 120 °C under 3 bar H2 pressure
is quantitative after 20 h. At the same H2 pressure and
increasing the temperature to 150 °C (entry 2) and 180 °C
(entry 3), the conversion becomes quantitative after 16 and 7 h, respectively,
showing once again the large impact of the reaction temperature on
the rate of squalene hydrogenation.

b Squalene conversion/squalane
selectivity
evaluated by GC–MS.

c Leaching of Pd and Si was assessed
by ICP-OES analysis in 1,1,2-trichloroethane.

Entries 4–6 in Table 6 show that reactions at 180 °C, with
over 0.2 mol % Pd
catalyst (corresponding to 0.005 mmol Pd/g of squalene) under 3–10
bar H2 pressure, result in quantitative conversion of squalene
to squalane after 16 h. Under higher H2 pressure (20 bar),
the rate of the squalene hydrogenation reaction increased with 98%
squalane selectivity observed after 4 h only, and the quantitative
conversion to squalane after 7 h (entries 7 and 8).

Finally,
lowering the SiliaCat Pd(0) load to 0.1
mol % Pd only (corresponding to 0.0024 mmol Pd/g of squalene), the
quantitative conversion to squalane could be achieved only at a higher
temperature and an H2 pressure (entries 9–12) at
180 °C, whereas over 0.05 mol % Pd (corresponding to 0.0012 mmol
Pd/g of squalene), the selectivity to squalane after 24 h was 58%
only under 10 bar H2 (entry 13) and 84% under 20 bar H2 pressure (entry 14) despite full conversion of squalene.
The relevance of the reaction parameters on the solvent-free squalene
hydrogenation to squalane over SiliaCat Pd(0), thus,
follows the order: Pd concentration > temperature > pressure.

We ascribe the high catalytic activity of the newly developed spherical
SiliaCat Pd(0) catalyst to (i) the large mesoporosity,
(ii) hydrophobicity of the organosilica matrix protecting the NPs
tightly entrapped within the sol–gel cages (Figure 7), and (iii) the enhanced morphology
with its much larger surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) when compared with analogous sol–gel catalyst
comprising irregular xerogel microparticles.

Figure 7 Molecular structure of
the SiliaCat Pd(0) catalyst.

The dramatic dependence of the hydrogenation rate on the
reaction
temperature may be explained by squalene/squalane diffusion limitations
through the inner porosity of the solid catalyst and subsequent access
to the active sites on the Pd NPs.

Catalyst Stability
The reusability of the catalyst
was evaluated in several consecutive multigram hydrogenation reactions
of 82% pure olive oil squalene (50 mL, 43.13 g, 105 mmol) using 0.5
mol % SiliaCat Pd(0) under solvent-free conditions
at 150 °C under 3 bar hydrogen pressure. In each cycle, once
the maximum conversion of squalene to squalane was achieved, the catalyst
was collected by filtration, washed with tetrahydrofuran (three times
during 10 min) to remove the wax impurities present in the olive oil
squalene, dried at room temperature and reused in the subsequent cycle. Figure 8 shows that the spherical
SiliaCat Pd(0) heterogeneous catalyst was reused
successfully in eight consecutive cycles.

Figure 8 Reusability of SiliaCat Pd(0) in squalene hydrogenation.

In the first three consecutive reaction tests, complete conversion
was obtained in 20 h, after which the squalane selectivity progressively
decreased to reach high values after 24 h (cycles 4 and 5) and after
40 h (cycles 6–8). The longer reaction time was applied to
ensure a high squalane conversion.

In brief, the SiliaCat Pd(0) heterogeneous catalyst
was stable and robust, which is a crucially important factor for practical
applications in place of conventional Pd/C and Ni-kieselguhr commercial
catalysts.

The amounts of Pd and Si leached from the SiliaCat Pd(0) during catalysis were assessed by analyzing via
ICP-OES the
metal content in the isolated crude product after the filtration of
the catalyst.a Values reported in Tables 4 and 6 show that in each case the values of leached Pd and Si found in
the crude product are <2 ppm.

Table 7 summarizes
the outcomes of squalene hydrogenation reaction using different heterogeneous
catalysts under optimized solvent-free conditions or with the substrate
dissolved in alcohol or n-heptane. Entry 2 in Table 7 shows that SiliaCat Pd(0) affords the highest yield and selectivity under
the mildest reaction conditions.

Conclusions
The newly developed
sol–gel-entrapped Pd catalyst SiliaCat Pd(0)
in spherical morphology added in small amount
of 0.2 mol % smoothly mediates the chemoselective full hydrogenation
of squalene into valued squalane under solvent-free, mild reaction
conditions (3 bar H2 at 70 °C). Catalysis is truly
heterogeneous, with values of leached palladium <2 ppm. The catalyst
is easily recovered and reused for several consecutive reaction runs
with practically no loss of catalytic activity, opening the route
to a cleaner and less-expensive hydrogenation of squalene. Compared
with numerous other commercial catalysts employed in industry, lower
temperatures and pressures are generally required due to several synergistic
factors that include easier accessibility of the Pd0 NPs
entrapped in the inner huge porosity of the hydrophobic organosilica
spherical microparticles of enhanced surface/volume ratio. Like organosilica
irregular xerogel catalysts of the SiliaCat series,25 the spherical SiliaCat Pd(0)
catalyst does not swell or stick to the reactor surface and can be
easily handled in air, showing no tendency to ignite upon exposure
to air, as happens with conventional Pd/C and related catalysts.

Squalane is an extremely important emollient and bioactive substance
with multiple health benefits and its production cost is significantly
(40%) impacted by the cost of the hydrogenation process.7 Now that phytosqualene biotechnologically derived
from sugarcane or extracted from olive oil milling residues is replacing
squalene of animal origin,2 these findings
will further contribute to lowering the cost and increasing the availability
of high-quality squalane.

were used as received. Multigram hydrogenation tests of squalene under
maximum pressure of 3 bar H2 at 120 °C were carried
out in an Ace Glass 6437 system equipped with a batch glass reactor.
The 500 mL glass reactor was charged with 250 mL olive squalene (82
wt % purity; 214.5 g, 522.25 mmol) and 4.43 g SiliaCat Pd(0) (2 wt %) for 0.2 mol % Pd. Mechanical stirring was then set
at 850 rpm and the reaction mixture was degassed five times, replacing
three times the vacuum by Ar and twice Ar with H2. The
hydrogenation reactions conducted at H2 pressure higher
than 3 bar were carried out in a Parr 4848 high-pressure reactor controller
equipped with a steel container. The 100 mL steel reactor was charged
with 50 mL olive squalene (43.13 g, 105 mmol, 82 wt % purity) and
0.89 g SiliaCat Pd(0) (2.5 wt %) for 0.2 mol % Pd
loading. The mixture stirred at 700 rpm was purged with H2 at 20 bar five times, after which the desired pressure was maintained.
The reaction temperature was then raised from 22 °C to the desired
reaction temperature and maintained for several hours, after which
the reaction mixture was allowed to reach 50 °C and the solid
catalyst recuperated by filtration. The reaction conversion and squalane
selectivity were assessed by GC–MS.

The GC–MS
analysis showed that in cases where the conversion
of squalene (molecular weight (MW): 410) to squalane (MW: 422) was
incomplete, a large number of intermediate partially hydrogenated
products (MW: 412, 414, 416, 418, and 420) were present in the reaction
mixture. We thus explored the effects of the reaction temperature,
hydrogen pressure, and catalyst loading on conversion and selectivity.

The physical properties of SiliaCat Pd(0) catalyst
were determined by nitrogen adsorption, transmission XRD, TEM, 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, and ICP-OES. Nitrogen adsorption
and desorption isotherms at 77 K were measured using a Micromeritics
TriStar II 3020 system. The resulting data were analyzed with the
TriStar II 3020 version 3.02 software. Both BJH adsorption and desorption
branches were used to calculate the pore size distribution. The XRD
analysis were performed on a Siemens D-5000 X-ray diffractometer equipped
with a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418).
The spectra were recorded in the 2θ range of 0–30°
for the undoped support and of 10–90° for SiliaCat Pd(0) catalyst at a scan speed of 1°/min and a
step scan of 0.02°. The powder diffraction file of the International
Centre for Diffraction Data was used to identify the diffraction peaks
characteristic of crystalline Pd(0) with a fcc lattice.

The
TEM photographs were taken with a JEOL-2010 microscope equipped
with a LaB6 electron gun source operated at 200 kV. Solid-state 29Si NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance spectrometer
(Milton, ON, Canada) at a Si frequency of 79.5 MHz. Each time the
solid sample was spun at 8 kHz in a 4 mm ZrO rotor. A Hahn echo sequence
synchronized with the spinning speed was used while applying a TPPM15
composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. A total of 2400 acquisitions
were recorded with a recycling delay of 30 s.

The leaching of
Pd and Si was assessed by ICP-OES analysis of the
squalane crude product in 1,1,2-trichloroethane (concentration 100
mg/mL) using a PerkinElmer Optima 2100 DV system. The values measured
are reported as milligram of Pd and as milligram of Si per kilogram
of squalane oil.
