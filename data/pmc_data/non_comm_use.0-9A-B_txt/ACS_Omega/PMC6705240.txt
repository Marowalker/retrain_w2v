Copper(I)
oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles (NPs) are selectively
prepared in high yields under continuous flow in a vortex fluidic
device (VFD), involving irradiation of a copper rod using a pulsed
laser operating at 1064 nm and 600 mJ. The plasma plume generated
inside a glass tube (20 mm O.D.), which is rapidly rotating (7.5 k
rpm), reacts with the enclosed air in the microfluidic platform, with
then high mass transfer of material into the dynamic thin film of
water passing up the tube. The average size of the generated Cu2ONPs is 14 nm, and they are converted to copper(II) oxide
(CuO) nanoparticles with an average diameter of 11 nm by heating the
as-prepared solution of Cu2ONPs in air at 50 °C for
10 h.

Introduction
The physical and chemical
properties of nanoparticles of metal
oxides are distinctly different to bulk materials, and they are attracting
considerable attention. They find applications in diverse fields,
including chemical manufacturing, environmental technology, energy
conversion, and storage as well as in biological areas.1−4 A diversity of techniques have been used to prepare metal oxide
particles in general, including electrophoretic and electrochemical
deposition,5 vacuum deposition,6 sonochemical processing,7 lithography, and diffusion-controlled nanoparticle growth.8 Focusing on dicopper oxide (Cu2O)
and copper oxide (CuO), they have been prepared using such techniques,
with the uniform size and shape of the particles.7,8 They
find particular use in catalytic organic transformations, electrocatalysis,
and photocatalysis.9−11 Developing synthetic methodologies and supports that
increase the stability of copper nanoparticles have been explored,
especially in regard to their sensitivity to oxygen, water, and different
reagents. This has led to the development of more complex-structured
nanoparticles, as in core–shell particles, and different ways
to oxidize the copper.12

Batch processing
is typically used in the fabrication of copper
oxide nanoparticles, but such processing can result in variation of
product from batch to batch, and refined reagents are required. An
alternative approach to prepare different metal oxides in general
involves the use of lasers, and this includes in the synthesis of
copper oxide nanoparticles.13−17 Pulsed laser ablation (PLA) involves ablating a solid target in
a liquid phase or in air, which has a number of advantages. These
include (a) not requiring the process to be operating under a high
vacuum, (b) the processing is simple and high yielding, and (c) it
avoids the use of chemicals. In addition, optimizing the experimental
parameters can result in controlling the shape and size of the nanoparticles.17 PLA involves absorption of the laser radiation
at the metal surface as the so-called interaction zone, which causes
the transformation of kinetic energy into thermal energy. Also, if
the laser power is sufficiently high, a local plasma plume with high
temperatures and pressures is formed,18 and this can lead to the formation of metal oxide particles in the
presence of oxygen.

We report the synthesis of copper(I) oxide
nanoparticles using
PLA under continuous flow conditions, which can minimize batch variation
in the process, as discussed above. Continuous flow processing is
important in being able to scale up from the research laboratory processing
to large-scale production, thereby avoiding batch-to-batch variation,
which can occur for traditional processing while minimizing capital
outlay, with built in just-in-time production.19 The synthesis featured the use of the vortex fluidic device
(VFD) as a dynamic thin film microfluidic processing platform, Figure 1. The relatively
inexpensive VFD houses a borosilicate glass tube (20 mm O.D.,17.5
mm I.D.), open at one end, which is rotated at high speed (up to 9
k rpm) and can be inclined from 0 to 90° relative to the horizontal
position.19−21 It has two common modes of operation as follows:
(i) the confined mode where a finite volume of liquid is added to
the rapidly rotating tube, and (ii) the continuous flow mode where
liquid is constantly fed into the tube usually as droplets. Under
the centrifugal force, the liquid whirls up and exits at the top of
the tube, and this continuous flow mode of operation of the VFD offers
scalability to the processing by simply extending the operating time.22−24 Applications of the VFD also include enhancing enzymatic reactions,19 controlling organic synthesis,20,25 probing the structure of self-organized systems,26 protein separation,27 exfoliation
of 2D graphite and boron nitride,21 protein
folding,28 and more,23,29−31Figure 1. Herein, we have established that the VFD is selective in forming
copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) NPs with an average particle size
of 14 nm in diameter, as a one-step continuous flow process at ambient
pressure, with the oval operation avoiding a purification step. The
process can also minimize the generation of waste, in avoiding the
need for adding any reagents, although specific surfactants can be
added at the end of the processing if required. Using an aqueous solution
and avoiding harsh chemicals impart high in green chemistry metrics
into the processing and developing more sustainable processing for
the future.27Figure 2 is a zoomed-in representation of the operation
of the VFD in generating Cu2ONPs when the laser strikes
the copper metal rod inside the rapidly rotating glass tube. The confined
mode was initially used to establish optimal conditions for generating
the Cu2ONPs, before applying these conditions to continuous
flow. This approach has been used for a number of applications of
the VFD in translating the processing into continuous flow. Heating
solutions of the generated copper(I) oxide particles, Cu2ONPs, in water results in conversion to nanoparticles of copper(II)
oxide, CuONPs. We note that the VFD is effective in being able to
control the size and shape of nanoparticles, for example, superparamagnetic
magnetite nanoparticales.23 In the context
of copper oxide nanoparticles, this is important for downstream applications,
for example, in gas sensors, magnetic phase transition, superconductors,
and catalysts.32,33

Results and Discussion
Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles were selectively
formed in the VFD under different operating conditions of the device,
with this material readily converted to copper(II) oxide (CuO) nanoparticles
post VFD processing by gentle heating in air. The optimization experiments
were initially carried out in the confined mode of operation of the
VFD, for a 15 min processing time, with 1 mL of Milli-Q water inside
the rapidly rotating tube. The tilt angles of all the experiments
were set at 45°, which has been established as optimal setting
for many applications of the device.23,24,34 The effect of choice of laser power was then explored,
using 450, 550, 600, and 650 mJ. For the lowest power, no product
could be isolated, with a low yield obtained at 550 mJ. In contrast,
high yields were obtained for 600 and 650 mJ, and accordingly, 600
mJ was chosen as optimal setting in being cognizance of minimizing
energy usage in developing processing high in green chemistry metrics.
The next operating parameter to be optimized was the rotational speed
of the tube, and to this end, we carried out laser ablation experiments
at 4.5 k, 5.5 k, 6.5 k, 7.5 k, and 8.5 k rpm. XRD was used as the
primarily characterization technique for the resulting Cu2ONPs. The rotational speeds of 4.5 k, 5.5 k, and 6.5 k rpm gave diameters
of 19 nm ± 2 nm, whereas 8.5 k rpm gave 17 nm ± 1 nm particles,
and 7.5 k rpm gave 14 nm ± 1 nm diameter particles, Figure S2b. Moreover, the XRD for material generated
at 4.5 k, 5.5 k, 6.5 k, and 8.5 k rpm showed increasing amount of
CuONPs relative to 7.5 k rpm, and this was chosen as the optimum speed.
Overall, the confined mode experiments established the optimal power
setting of the laser and optimal rotation speed while minimizing the
amount of conversion of Cu2ONPs to CuONPs.

The flow
rate of Milli-Q water into the VFD was then optimized,
for 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 mL/min flow rates. The 1, 0.75, 0.5,
and 0.1 mL/min flow rates resulted in a higher percentage of CuONPs
relative to 0.25 mL/min, Figure S2c, and
this flow rate was then considered as optimal for preparing Cu2ONPs. Thus, the overall optimized conditions were at a laser
power of 600 mJ, a rotational speed of 7.5 k rpm, and with a flow
rate of 0.25 mL/min. Water was used to dilute the solution, necessitating
the drying of the product, Figure S2c and Figures 3 and 4. The copper rod showed visible etching
and blackening post laser ablation experiments.

laser operating at 600 mJ. Analogous data were obtained for CuONPs
prepared from a dispersion of Cu2ONPs heated to 50 °C
for 10 h.

The pH of water used for the experiment was 6.90, but immediately
after the VFD processing, it was slightly lower at 6.75, with the
solution containing a dispersion of Cu2ONPs. After heating
the solution at 50 °C for 10 h in an oven, the pH decreased slightly
to 6.69, with the NPs converted to CuO. ATR-FTIR spectra established
the presence of Cu2ONPs and CuONPs, with a broad peak at
3400 cm–1 corresponding to an O–H stretching
vibration band and 1628 cm–1 bending vibration of
water and surface-bound hydroxyl moieties.35,36 Two peaks in the fingerprint region, at 1025 and 857 cm–1, correspond to bending vibrations for surface-bound hydroxyl moieties.36 Any CuO present was identified by peaks at 979
and 931 cm–1 as well as at 597 cm–1, which corresponds to Cu–O vibrations, Figure 3b.35,37−40 UV–vis spectra could be used to differentiate between Cu2ONPs and CuONPs, with solutions of the pure components taking
on clear light green and light brown solutions, respectively.41−43 A clear brown solution of CuONPs44 was
prepared after heating a Cu2ONP solution in air at 50 °C
for 10 h. Figure 3a
shows a color change from green to brown in accordance with the change
of band gap energy between Cu2ONPs and CuONPs. The presence
of the different copper oxide structures was established using XRD,
at the same time providing the average particle size of the isolated
materials using the Scherrer equation. The XRD pattern (Co Kα,
λ = 1.7889 Å) was devoid of peaks for elemental copper,
ruling out the formation of a core–shell structure such as
Cu@Cu2O,45,46 but with peaks corresponding
to Cu2O, at 34.8, 42.7, 49.6, 62.2, 72.9, and 88.1°, Figure 3c.46−50 The Cu2O diffraction pattern had peaks
at 2θ of 34.8, 42.7, 49.6, 62.2, 72.9, and 88.1°, corresponding
to (110), (111), (200), (211), (220), and (311) for cubic cuprite,
respectively.46−50 In addition, there were small peaks assigned to the presence of
some CuO, presumably arising from some oxidation during the workup
immediately post VFD processing. The peaks for CuONPs are at 2θ
of 38.2, 41.6, 45.4, 54.3, 57.4, 63.5, 68.9, 73, 78.6, 81.3, and 86.7°,
corresponding to (110), (111), (111), (112), (202), (020), (202),
(113), (002), (311), and (220), respectively. Heating the Cu2NPs at 50 °C for 10 h gave sharp peaks corresponding to the
diffraction pattern for exclusively CuO, Figure 3c.51,52 The size of the Cu2ONPs was estimated from the Scherrer equation to be 14 ±
1 nm and the size of the CuONPs at 11 ± 1 nm.

The mechanism
of forming the nanoparticles by laser irradiation
of copper metal in the VFD involves creating Cu2ONPs in
the air in the VFD tube, Figure S6. The
metal rod contains no copper oxide, and thus, the oxygen is from the
air. Moreover, the thermal energy delivered to the surface of the
copper target creates a plume of copper, which reacts with oxygen
in the air, resulting in the formation of Cu2ONPs, and
this is reflected in a change of color of the liquid from colorless
to green48,49 during the processing. When a pure nitrogen
gas atmosphere was used in the VFD, as a control experiment, no oxidation
was evident, and there was no change in color of the water, Figure S6. Thus, oxygen in the air is the reactive
species in forming Cu2ONPs. The time and temperature with
oxygen from air were keys to convert Cu2ONPs to CuONPs, Figure S5.53,54 It is also noteworthy
that there was no evidence for the formation of core–shell
Cu@CuO2NPs or indeed any particles based on elemental copper
(XPS and XRD). The need for a partial pressure of oxygen gas is also
evident by the formation of Cu2ONPs in toluene or isopropyl
alcohol (IPA), Figure S4, but these reactions
were not pursued further given that the focus of the research is on
developing processes that are high in green chemistry metrics, in
avoiding the generation of an organic solvent waste stream and the
formation of metal carbide nanoparticles.

According to the literature,
the binding energies of Cu(I) by XPS
are at about 936.5 and 956.5 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively.
On the other hand, XPS energies for Cu (II) are shifted to about 934
and 954 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. Furthermore, the
CuONP spectrum had two extra peaks at 941.2 and 943.7 eV. These correspond
to the relative intensities of the shake-up satellites on the surface
of the material, Figure 4a,c. Moreover, the XPS spectra for O1s in Cu2O and CuO
were distinctly different with the O1s in CuO shifting from 534.5
and 532.4 eV to 531.3 and 529.7 eV, respectively, Figure 4b,d.55−58 The XPS results are also consistent
with the sample being devoid of elemental copper, as for example in
Cu@Cu2O, being devoid of the Cu(0) peak at 932 eV and associated
shake-up satelites,59Figure 4a. The XPS spectrum for Cu2ONPs has peaks at about 936.5 and 956.5 eV, representing Cu
2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. The shake-up satellites are at around
944.1 eV with the shake-up satellites for the CuONPs are at 941.2
and 943.7 eV.55−58

The morphology, size, and shape of Cu2ONPs and
CuONPs
were investigated by SEM, AFM, and TEM, respectively. Both nanoparticles
were shown to have a similar topography and were aggregated. The size
of the nanoparticles was established using XRD and SEM, Figure 5 and Figures S7 and S8. AFM images gave information
on the size of the nanoparticles, Figure 7. In addition, TEM images for both Cu2ONPs and CuONPs provided more details about the size and shape
of the nanoparticles, showing a different shape for each structure, Figure 6 and Figure S9. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) on
both Cu2ONPs and CuONPs in solution established the presence
of agglomerates, 164 and 91 nm diameters for Cu2ONPs and
CuONPs, respectively, Figure 8. The sizes of Cu2ONPs and CuONPs were measured
for about 200 particles from TEM images. These showed size estimations
similar to those from the Scherrer equation for the bulk material, Figure 9. Magnetization data
was collected for CuONPs, showing an essentially linear (paramagnetic)
response versus applied field to 1.5 T, with a hint of ferromagnetism
at very low fields. The results are consistent with the previous measurements
by Punnoose et al.60 both in terms of the
form and magnitude of the magnetization. From Figure 10, it can be seen that magnetization is 0.0473
(Am2 Kg–1) at room temperature and 1.5
T for CuONPs collected from outside the VFD tube and 0.0482 M (Am2 Kg–1) for particles from inside the VFD
tube. These values of magnetization for the ≈11 nm NPs of this
work are slightly smaller than those recorded at room temperature
and 1.5 T for 6.6 nm NPs by Punnoose et al.60 in line with the magnetization versus particle size trends of their
work.

Conclusions
Cu2ONPs were
prepared by pulsed laser irradiation of
a pure copper rod positioned inside a VFD tube, with the material
readily converted to copper(II) oxide on mild heating in solution.
The NPs are created in situ, in a continuous flow
process, using water as the choice for solvent. TEM images and XRD
data incorporating the use of the Scherrer equation established the
presence of nanometer-sized particle, with the mechanism of formation
of Cu2ONPs involving oxidation of copper in air above the
thin film of liquid in the VFD. The new method of the synthesis of
these NPs is simple and in high yield, using metal as the source of
copper, at the same time avoiding the use of harsh chemicals or agents
using water as the choice for solvent,23,24 and the scene
is set for using this method for generating oxides of other metals.

Overall, the overall novelty of this work is the ability to selectively
prepare relatively small Cu2ONPs from elemental copper,
using a process that can minimize the generation of waste, and this
is possible using the VFD thin-film microfluidic platform. Also, it
is noteworthy to note that the Cu2ONPs are readily converted
to small CuONPs by mild heating, and that selectively forming Cu2ONPs in water using laser processing is challenging,17,23 being difficult to scale and control the homogeneity, with long
ablation times resulting mainly in the formation of larger particles.

In exploring the applicability of the process for scaling up, we
prepared 200 mg of Cu2ONPs, as a powder, over 12 h for
a single pass through the VFD. In addition, we prepared 200 mg of
CuONPs as a powder, from heating a suspension of 200 mg of Cu2ONPs in water at 50 °C. This augurs well for the potential
application of the copper(I and II) oxide NPs.1−4

Experimental Section
Materials
A high purity (>99.998%) 8361 h copper metal
rod of 8 mm in diameter (Koch-Light Laboratories Ltd. Colnbrook Bucks,
England) was used for all the processing. Milli-Q water was used.

Synthesis of Cu2O and CuO
Nanoparticles
of Cu2O were generated in the dynamic thin film in the
VFD tube (borosilicate glass tube of 20 mm O.D., 17.5 mm I.D., and
19.5 cm in length) on irradiating a stationary pure copper rod (>99.998%)
located in the middle of the tube. The laser used was generated from
a Nd:YAG source, as a pulsed source operating at 1064 nm and 600 mJ/pulse.
The laser was operated unfocussed, with a beam diameter of 8 mm, giving
a fluence of 1.2 J cm–2. Under continuous flow,
water was delivered via a jet feed to the base of the tube, with a
flow rate setting of 0.25 mL/min, and for confined mode, 1 mL of liquid
was added to the tube with the experiment run for 15 min. The rotational
speed for the glass tube in the VFD was 7.5 k rpm, with the tube titled
at 45° relative to the horizontal position. The product from
confined mode and continuous flow was Cu2ONPs dispersed
in water. The method used to collect the product after 90 min was
as follows: approximately 20 mL of solution, Figure S5a, was centrifuged at RCF = 9980 g for 20 min; whereupon,
the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was redispersed in 5 mL
of acetone, followed by centrifugation at RCF = 4000 g for 10 min.
The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet was left to air dry
for 5 min. This method was effective in rapidly removing the water
and collecting the Cu2ONPs as a powder. This powder was
then stored in a sealed vial, taking care to exclude oxygen in avoiding
oxidizing the material to CuONPs, which was shown to occur after 1
week. For each 1 mL of the original solution from the continuous flow
process, approximately 0.8 mg of product was collected. The method
used to deliberately prepare CuONPs was to heat a dispersion of the
Cu2ONPs from the continuous flow process in an oven at
50 °C for 10 h as shown in Figure S5b. The water was then removed under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator),
affording a brown powder, which was stable in air. The same steps
were used to isolate the product remaining in the tube after continuous
flow processing. On completing the experiment, the material remaining
in the VFD tube was shown to be Cu2ONPs. This was collected
from inside the VFD tube after 2 h of processing using the same above
method, Figure S4e. Approximately 15 mg
of Cu2ONPs was collected inside the VFD, post processing.
Cu2ONPs collected from inside the VFD tube after 2 h using
15 mL of water afforded approximately 15 mg of the material.

Characterization
The nanoparticles were characterized
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Inspect FEI F50), atomic
force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope 8.10 tapping mode), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra, with a monochromatic Al Ka X-ray
source), XRD (Bruker D8 ADVANCE ECO, Co Kα, λ = 1.7889
A), ATR-FTIR (Perkin Elmer Frontier), UV–vis spectroscopy (Agilent
technologies Cary 60 Uv–vis), and TEM (Tecnai_G2_Spirit). Particles
were collected using a centrifuge (Dynamica VELOCITY 14R). Magnetization
measurements were carried out using a Quantum design MPMS at 295 K
in the field range ± 1.50 T.
