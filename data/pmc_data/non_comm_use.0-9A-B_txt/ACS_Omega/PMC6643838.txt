In
this article, the polymer network chain formation through cross-linking
and scission under n strain stages is studied based
on the thermal fluctuation principle. The aim is to clarify the effects
of chemical reactions, especially the network chain cross-linking,
dangling chain cross-linking, cross-link scission, and network chain
scission, on the free energy of network chain to generalize the classical
two-network model. In our model, the free energy change for a chain
formation is associated with the reaction sequences, except network
chain cross-linking or cross-link scission reactions under the same
strain stage. A new constitutive expression for network chain formed
under two strain stages is derived according to affine deformation
theory in which independent network hypothesis and stress-transfer
function are not required. Comparison between our model and previous
experimental data about recovered stretch ratio of γ-irradiated
silicone elastomer validates that our model can give more precise
result than previous two-network model.

1 Introduction
In general, most elastomeric
polymer products are practically used
under strain. And, the occurrence of cross-linking and scission is
inevitable when the polymer is used at high temperature, irradiation
condition, or long time duration, resulting in permanent changes in
the chain property and network topology. This is termed as “chemical
relaxation” effect for changes of the mechanical behavior with
time. Based on the changes in average network chain property, Tobolsky
and co-workers first proposed the two-network model to describe the
relaxation behavior of rubber under strain.1 Independent network hypothesis is applied in Tobolsky’s two-network
model, where the new cross-links formed by cross-linking are treated
as an additional independent network to balance the stress of the
original network. As the scission reaction is ignored, Berry et al.2 and Scanlan and Watson3 discovered that the Tobolsky’s two-network model cannot describe
the stress relaxation behavior of aging rubber. Therefore, Flory4 and Fricker5 introduced
stress-transfer function to describe the memory or feedback effect6 caused by the cross-link scission. Up to date,
two-network model is widely used to describe elastic behavior for
polymer temperature aging,7 oxidative aging,8 radiation aging,6,9,10 double network,9,10 transient network,11,12 and so on. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations have confirmed
the two-network model and explained the stress-transfer function.13−15

Although the two-network model has been successfully employed
in
many fields, it still cannot completely characterize the chemical
reactions of a network chain formation. In Figure 1, we list several important chemical reactions
during chain formation. First, the reaction from state of Figure 1a to state of Figure 1b or from state of Figure 1c to state of Figure 1d is network chain
scission, which will form the stress-free dangling chains. Second,
the reaction from state of Figure 1a to state of Figure 1c or from state of Figure 1b to state of Figure 1d is the network chain cross-linking, which
will improve the cross-link density and therefore increase the material
modulus. Especially, network chains formed by cross-linking of dangling
chains are in the state of ease as sketched from state of Figure 1b to state of Figure 1d. Moreover, the
reaction from state of Figure 1c to state of Figure 1a or from state of Figure 1d to state of Figure 1b is the cross-link scission, which will result in
the feedback or memory effect.4,5 Additionally, it should
be noted that there is another special reaction of cross-link scission,
which is different from the reaction as shown in state of Figure 1c to state of Figure 1a. As shown in Figure 1e, chain AB and chain
CD can be reorganized into chain AC and chain BD by the bond-exchange
reaction, which yields covalent adaptable networks.16,17 Unfortunately, two-network model uses only two parameters, scission
ratio ξsci and cross-linking ratio ξxl, to describe the scission and cross-linking reactions.6,18,19 Obviously, the parameter ξsci does not distinguish effects of network chain scission
and cross-link scission, and the parameter ξxl does
not distinguish network chain cross-linking and dangling chain cross-linking.

Chemical reactions not only affect
the property of network chain,
but also affect the network topology. To study the effect of chemical
reactions on the formation of a network chain, a lot of theoretical
analyses20−25 and numerical simulations21,26−31 have paid the main attention to the length or molecular weight of
the chains and the topology of networks. Here, we focus on the effects
of chemical reactions on the property of average network chains. Although
numerical simulations32,33 can calculate the free energy
of a network chain with the given formation history, there is not
a systematic theoretical model for network chain formation due to
arbitrary chemical reactions under n strain stages.
To the best of our knowledge, only Baxandall and Edwards34 have given the theoretical function for the
free energy changes of the network chains after cross-linking under n strain stages.

To describe precisely the formation
history of an ideal chain over
complex bond reactions, here we generalize the two-network model based
on thermal fluctuation principle. In Section 2, we propose a fluctuation deformation-based
method to describe the effect of cross-linking and scission on the
free energy change of a network chain and build the theoretical formation
model of the network chain under strain. In Section 3, based on our formation model, we discuss
the relationship between the free energy change of a network chain
and its formation history. In addition, we reconstruct the constitutive
model for the network undergone two strain stages based on affine
deformation and derive the recovered stretch ratio function. After
the comparison between our theoretical model with previous experimental
data about recovered stretch ratio of silicone elastomer, conclusions
are given in the end.

2 Theoretical Model
2.1 Fluctuated Chain Model
Here, we adopt
the assumptions as Flory’s two-network model to describe the
chemical reactions of ideal chains based on affine deformation:4 (1) the positions of chemical bonds cross-linking
and scission are independent and distributed uniformly in the network;
(2) the cross-links deform as if they were embedded in a homogeneous
and isotropic elastic continuum.

For ideal chains, the free
energy is decided by the conformation entropy.20 Moreover, the Gaussian distributed conformation of ideal
chains can be equivalent with an average chain composed of thermal
fluctuated monomers. Hence, a fluctuated chain is introduced here
as a representative chain to describe the mechanical behavior of polymer
network. As shown in Figure 2a, monomers on chain AB fluctuate randomly from their thermal
equilibrium positions except cross-links A and B pinned on the background.
When cross-linking takes place on the monomer C, it is pinned on the
elastic continuum background and its instantaneous location C1 is fixed. For example, if the instantaneous location C1 is at thermal equilibrium location C0 (free energy
of this state is not changed), where the end-to-end distance ratio
|RAC|/|RBC| equals
Kuhn length ratio NAC/NBC, the two subchains AC and BC have the same elastic
property with the parent chain AB and permanent deformation is nonexistent.
If cross-linking happens at C1, where the monomer C fluctuates
from C0, with a fluctuation displacement δ, the elastic properties of two subchains AC and BC are different
from that of parent chain AB and permanent deformation occurs. It
should be noted that for an instantaneous location C1,
the two subchains AC and BC are no longer Gaussian. In Section 2.2, we will introduce
the statistical behavior of monomer C to keep the Gaussian property
of subchains and make affine theory to be applicable. Based on affine
theory, the deformation of the average chain is coincident with the
macrodeformation. Therefore, the fluctuation displacement δ can affect the macrodeformation and change the free energy. In other
words, fluctuation-induced macrodeformation can be applied to describe
the effect of cross-linking reaction on the free energy of a chain.
Cross-link scission as the inverse reaction of cross-linking can also
be handled by the fluctuation deformation. In the following, we use
fluctuation deformation to describe the chemical reactions shown in Figure 1.

chain AB under thermal fluctuation. The

background. The blue dot line represents the conformation of the chain with monomer

(c) Schematic of the equivalent relationship between deformation free
energy change ΔFR of cross-linking
and fluctuation stretch ratio λδ.

2.2 Cross-Linking Reaction
First, we
analyze the cross-linking reaction. To simplify the model, Figure 2b shows that a one-dimensional
chain AB with length N (number of Kuhn units) deforms
from original end-to-end distance R0 to
current end-to-end distance R. The stretch ratio
λ is defined as λ = R/R0. For the ideal chain in the one-dimensional space, we
have ⟨R02⟩ = Nb2/3, where the sign ⟨•⟩ expresses the mean value of a random variable and b is the Kuhn length. If cross-linking occurs at the equilibrium
position C0 of monomer C, the chain AB is divided into
two subchains AC and BC, whose Kuhn numbers are N1 and N2, respectively. Accordingly,
the splitting ratios are defined as θ1 = N1/N and θ2 = N2/N. So, the end-to-end
distances of the two subchains AC and BC are R1′ = Rθ1 and R2′ = Rθ2, respectively. Obviously, this linear splitting does not change
the total free energy.

Practically, the instantaneous position
of monomer C deviates from the equilibrium position C0 with
the thermal fluctuation displacement δ. When cross-linking happens,
monomer C is pinned on the instantaneous position C1 in
the elastic continuum background based on assumptions (2). So, we
have the end-to-end distances Rα = Rα′ ± δ, where
the subscript α = 1 or 2 for subchains AC or BC. The additional
stretch ratios imposed by fluctuation displacement δ for AC
and BC are 1  Define λδα as the “fluctuation stretch ratio”. The end-to-end
distances for AC and BC can be rewritten as 2  For an
ideal chain, the free energy can be
expressed as 3  in
which kB is
the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.20 The first term on the right of eq 3 is R-dependent
free energy and can be expressed as a function of λ with the
form FR(λ) = kBTλ2/2. Here,
we named FR as the deformation
free energy. The second term F(N, 0) is the R-independent free energy for zero end-to-end
distance chain and depends only on the Kuhn units number N.35 Because the total number of Kuhn units
is not changed by the chemical reactions, the equation F(N, 0) = F(N1, 0) + F(N2,
0) for the subchains AC and BC must be held. Therefore, the free energy
change caused by chemical reactions depends only on the deformation
free energy change, which means ΔF = F(N, R) – F(N1, R1) – F(N2, R2) = ΔFR. For a subchain in one-dimensional
condition, free energy change caused by the fluctuation stretch ratio
is ΔF(λδα) = kBTλα2(λδα2 – 1)/2. It is noted that the stretch ratio of
each subchain λα = λ√θα because original end-to-end distance of the subchain
is R0α = R0√θα. Therefore, free energy
changes of the two subchains are 4  Hence, all the free energy
change caused by
the fluctuation displacement δ reads 5  Based on the
theory of thermofluctuation,
ΔF(δ) must conform to Boltzmann distribution.
So, the probability of δ is P(δ) = A exp(−ΔF(δ)/kBT), where A is the normalized constant. The mean values of δ and δ2 can be derived as ⟨δ⟩ = 0 and 6  Taking the value
of ⟨δ2⟩ into eq 5,
we have ⟨ΔF(δ)⟩ = kBT/2, which is independent
of the deformation state. In the remaining of this paper, we directly
use the free energy change ΔF to express the
mean value of free energy change. Equivalently, we can obtain the
value of ΔF by the theorem of energy equipartition
theory. When the number of chains increases by one, the free energy
of system increases by kBT/2 per space dimension. Thus, the effects of the reactions, including
cross-linking or scission, on the free energy change of the system
can be linked to the fluctuation stretch ratio through eqs 4–6. Taking the value of ⟨δ2⟩ into eq 2 and choosing λ =
1, the mean square values of end-to-end distances for AC and BC are
⟨R12⟩ = Nθ1b2/3 and
⟨R22⟩ = Nθ2b2/3, respectively,
which satisfy the characteristic of Gaussian chains. With the help
of the statistical behavior about monomer C, subchains hold the Gaussian
property and affine theory is applicable.

It should be noted
that the fluctuation stretch ratio λδ does
not affect the mean value of end-to-end distance
because of ⟨λδ⟩ = 1 based on eq 1. But λδ plays an important role in relating the cross-linking with deformation
of the chain and makes the subchains following the Gaussian distribution. Figure 2c illustrated the
relationship between the deformation free energy change and fluctuation
stretch ratio. For a network chain in the state of S1 with
stretch ratio λ1, the relationship between deformation
free energy and stretch ratio can be described by the function F1R(λ). After
cross-linking, the network chain changes from state S1 to
S2 with deformation free energy increment kBT/2. The relationship of deformation
free energy and stretch ratio for S2 can be described by
another function F2R(λ). For equivalence, the deformation free energy of
state S2 equals that of state S3 according to
the relationship F1R(λ). The deformation in state S3 has an increment
λδ compared with state S1, where
λδ represents the fluctuation stretch ratio
due to cross-linking. So, the description of cross-linking reaction
can be unified in the deformation-dependent free energy function of FR(λδ).

We generalize the cross-linking model of one deformation
stage
to n discrete deformation stages, where one cross-linking
reaction happens at each deformation stage. This problem has been
discussed by Baxandall and Edwards with the replica theory.34 Assume that the end-to-end distance of an original
network chain R0 after ith cross-linking is Ri, and the splitting ratio of Ri relative to Ri–1 is θi, where i = 1, 2,..., n. The fluctuation stretch ratio caused
by the cross-linking in ith deformation state is
λδi and we have
λδi = 1 + δi/(Ri–1θi) based on eq 1. Generalizing eq 2 to the nth stage, we have 7  where λi is the stretch ratio of the ith stage related to
(i – 1)th stage. Introducing variables 8  which represent the accumulated values of
the mean-square fluctuation stretch ratio, stretch ratio, and splitting
ratio after original network chain cross-linking n times, respectively, the mean-square end-to-end distance Rn of eq 7 yields 9  Using the
recursive method, we obtain the
mean-square fluctuation stretch ratio as (see Appendix for detail) 10  where Bi = 1/Θi – 1/Θi–1 is named
as the multiplication
factor for the ith stage, representing the incremental
number of network chains from (i – 1)th stage
to the ith stage. Obviously, the deformation free
energy of a single network chain is 11  Explicitly,
the value of 1/Θn denotes the total
number of subchains formed after
the nth stage. If the subchains experience additional
deformation λ after n deformation stages, the
final deformation state is Λ = Λnλ. Therefore, the free energy change of a network after n deformation stages is the difference between the total
free energy of the current state FR/Θn and the state without
chemical reactions kBTΛ2/2, which yields 12  The result of eq 12 coincided with the Baxandall and
Edwards’
model,34 but the derivation here does not
use the replica theory. Especially for one time cross-linking condition
of n = 1, we have ΔF = (kBT/2)(Λ2/Λ12).

2.3 Cross-Link Scission Reaction
Now,
we consider the cross-link scission reaction. As sketched in Figure 3a, the uncross-linking
state S1 has one network chain with free energy F1 and the cross-linking state S2 has
two network chains with free energy F2. The progress of cross-linking reaction is from state S1 to S2, and the inverse progress is the cross-link scission
reaction. According to the view of the chemical reaction kinetics,
these two reactions have different energy barriers to overcome. However,
according to the view of the chemical reaction thermodynamics, the
energy difference between S1 and S2 is fixed
as kBT/2, which is independent
of reaction paths and deformation state. If we set a cross-link break
in deformation state of Λs, the total free energy
change of chains is −(kBT/2)(Λ2/Λs2) when the network deforms to stretch ratio Λ,
which is the reverse value of cross-linking for n = 1.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic of free energy transformation path for network chain
cross-linking and cross-link scission. (b) Sketch of a cross-link
scission process of network chains AC and BC which own different cross-linking
history.

Figure 3b shows
an ordinary network chain AB formed from cross-link scission of AC
and BC. Network chain AC is formed from chain L1 by n1 stages cross-linking and BC is formed from
chain L2 by n2 stages cross-linking.
Assume that the system is undergone n strain stages
before cross-link scission, we have n ≥ n1 and n ≥ n2. Introduce null stage (no chemical reaction) with the BiAC = 0 or BiBC = 0 into L1 or L2 to make sure n1 = n2 = n. Cross-linking
history of AC and BC are defined as ΘnAC, ΛδnAC, ΘnBC, and ΛδnBC, respectively. ΛδnAC and ΛδnBC can be obtained from eq 10, and the free energy for AC and BC can be
derived from eq 11.
When the cross-link scission happens at (n + 1) step
with strain state Λn+1, the free
energy change by cross-link scission is −(kBT/2)(Λ2/Λn+12), and the total free energy
of chain AB is 13  with 14  in which BiAB (i = 1, 2,..., n + 1) are the equivalent multiplication
factors, and Λδ(n+1)AB is the mean-square fluctuation
stretch ratio of chain AB. Here, (Λδ(n+1)AB)2 has the same functional form as the (ΛδnAB)2 in eq 10, which indicates that the cross-link scission
can also be described by the fluctuation stretch ratio. Therefore,
if we choose chain AB experiencing n times cross-linking
and one time cross-link scission as the average chain, the free energy
change of network has the same form as eq 12, which is 15  Explicitly,
we have Bn+1AB < 0 in eq 15, which
represents the total decrement of cross-links due to the cross-link
scission reaction, and we no longer need the stress-transfer function
to describe the cross-link scission reaction. Although Baxandall and
Edwards34 have obtained eq 12, they have not extended the equation
to describe the cross-link scission reaction. Additionally, for any
cross-linking and cross-link scission sequence, we can obtain multiplication
factors from eq 14 and
the total free energy change from eq 15.

2.4 Other Reactions
Network chain scission
is another scission reaction, illustrated as the reaction from state
of Figure 1a to state
of Figure 1b. Because
the dangling chains formed by network chain scission cannot bear loads,
the deformation free energy must be zero, which means FR = 0. Network chain scission loses all
formation history of the original chain. So, we have Λδ2 = 0 from eq 11. After network chain scission, the dangling chains can cross-link
to form new stress-free network chains under strain Λr, which is the reaction illustrated in the reaction from state of Figure 1b to state of Figure 1d. In this case,
the deformation free energy of the new network chain is kBT/2 for Θ = 1. The accumulated
values of mean-square fluctuation stretch ratio can be derived from eq 11 as 16  which is completely different from eq 10 for the loss of formation
history. In addition, the dangling chain can form dangling cyclic
chain through cross-linking by itself. The dangling cyclic chain also
cannot bear loads, so we have FR = 0 and Λδ2 = 0 based on eq 11. For the bond-exchange
reaction as shown in Figure 1e, it only changes the network topology and does not change
the number of chains. So, the free energy of network chain does not
change. Many researches have been done to study the changes in network
topology on the network elasticity,24,25 but here we
just focus on the free energy changes of average chain under isotropic
condition.

From the above discussion, our model can be used
to describe different chemical reactions and their effects on the
free energy of network chain. The formation history of a network chain
is recorded by accumulated values of fluctuation stretch ratio. We
can find that the chain scission has an important effect on the formation
of network chain because it makes the network chain lose the formation
history until reforming the new network chain.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Formation History of a
Network Chain
In general, the formation history of a network
chain is the sequence
of chemical reactions under different deformation states. We first
discuss the relationship between the free energy change of a network
chain and chemical reaction sequence. Based on eqs 12 and 15, the total
free energy changes of the system due to cross-linking and scission
directly relate with Bi and Λi (i = 1,
2,..., n). Obviously, if Bi changes with Λi, the formation history of the chain is correlated with the cross-linking
and scission sequence. If Λi is
fixed, the sequence of Bi can be changed. This sequence-independent property has been used
in the classical two-network model. It not only simplifies the theoretical
analysis of cross-linking and cross-link scission4,5,34 but also reduces the calculation complexity
of numerical simulation greatly.13−15,36 When network chain scission happens, the dangling chains are formed
and the strain state is released. As the lost deformation history
is dependent on the sequence number of network chain scission reactions,
the chain formation sequences have great effect on the free energy
change. In conclusion, the free energy change for a chain formation
is associated with the reaction sequences, except network chain cross-linking
or cross-link scission reactions under the same strain stage.

3.2 Constitutive Model
Using our network
chain formation model, we reconstruct the constitutive equation for
the polymer undergone chemical reactions at deformation state λ1. Based on the formation history, the network chains are categorized
into dangling-dependent chains whose formation history contains network
chain scission and dangling-independent chains whose formation history
does not include the network chain scission. Assume that the fraction
of the original chains undergone chain scission reaction is ξsci. So, the network chains can be categorized into dangling-dependent
chains with proportion ξsci and dangling-independent
chains with proportion (1 – ξsci). Set the
average multiplication factor of each chain as B,
so the increment number of chains or cross-links is ξxl = B. For dangling-independent chains, the mean-square
fluctuation stretch ratio can be deduced from eq 10 as ΛδC2 = 1 + ξxl/λ12. For
the dangling-dependent chains, the reaction sequence can affect the
mean-square fluctuation stretch ratio but not the constitutive model.
For simplification, we assume the chain breaks first and then cross-links
with another chain to form a new network chain; hence, ΛδD2 = ξxl/λ12. After the chemical reactions, the state of each chain
can be described as λΛδ. Here, we use
the same symbols ξsci and ξxl with
different physical meaning to compare with classical two-network model.
Because these two types of chains are independent, the stress σtotal of the system can be derived by superposing their stresses
as 17  where σ
(•) expresses the constitutive
equation. Because the free energy changes are taken into account naturally
in our formation model, the independent network hypothesis and the
stress-transfer function are not needed, which coincide with the result
of Weisgraber’s molecular dynamics simulation.36

Under uniaxial load in the x-direction,
we use the Neo–Hookean constitutive model to obtain the constitutive
equation as 18  where G0 is the
shear modulus of the pristine material. The first item on the right
side of eq 18 is the
stress coming from dangling-independent chains whose mean-square fluctuation
stretch ratio is ΛδC;x2 = 1 + ξxl/λ12. For the uniaxial loading condition, if the stretch ratio in the x direction is λ1 and the stretch ratios
in the y and z axes are the same
as 1/√λ1, then the mean-square fluctuation
stretch ratio in the y- and z-directions
are ΛδC;yz2 = 1
+ ξxl λ1. The second item on the
right side of eq 18 is
the stress coming from the dangling-dependent chains whose mean-square
fluctuation stretch ratio is ΛδD;x2 = ξxl/λ12. The mean-square fluctuation stretch ratios in y- and z-axes are the same as ΛδD;yz2 = ξxl λ1. Then, eq 18 can be simplified as the following form 19  Obviously, eq 19 has the same form as the constitutive
equation based
on the two-network model. Solving eq 19 for σ = 0, we obtain the recovered stretch ratio
as 20  where feff = ξxl/(1 – ξsci). For the constitutive
equation base on two-network model, we also get the same expression
of recovered stretch ratio as eq 20, but feff = f1,eff/f0,eff. Specially, for
Tobolsky’s two-network model, we have f1,eff = ξxl and f0,eff = 1 for just the cross-linking reaction. For Fricker’s two-network
model, the additional stress-transfer function Φ = ξsci/(1 + ξxl) is needed to describe the memory
or feedback effect of cross-link scission,6 and we have f0,eff = (1 – ξsci + Φξxl) and f1,eff = (1 – Φ)ξxl.

To
validate our model, we compare the results of our model with
the experiment and the previous two-network model. Here, we adopt
the experimental data about the recovered stretch ratio of the stretched
silicone elastomer after γ-radiation obtained by Chinn et al.37 With the assumption of the linear dependence
of chain scission, cross-linking, and cross-link scission proportions
on radiation dosage D, we have ξ sci = ksciD, ξ xl = kxlD, where ksci and kxl are
constants. In the experiment of Chinn et al.,37 the values of stretch state for γ-radiation are λ1 = 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9. Using eq 20 to fit the experimental data, we have ksci = 0.002203 (kGray)−1 and kxl = 0.007273 (kGray)−1, which
are different from the values of Maiti et al. obtained from the two-network
model with ksci = 0.002 (kGray)−1 and kxl = 0.010 (kGray)−1.9Figure 4a gives the comparison of the results of our model,
the experimental data, and results from Fricker’s two-network
model. Both our model and Fricker’s two-network model can give
good perdition for conditions of λ1 = 1.2, 1.4, and
1.6. But for λ1 = 1.9, Fricker’s two-network
model has a great derivation from the experimental data and our model
can also give a good prediction. The reason is that our model can
properly distinguish the different reactions and their effects on
the free energy of network chain. Moreover, net cross-link density
ratio can be calculated as ν1/ν0 = (1 – ξsci + ξxl), where
ν1 and ν0 are the cross-link density
of the current state and the initial state. Figure 4b gives the comparison of the experimental
data measured by NMR and the solvent swelling methods,37 results from Tobolsky’s two-network model,37 Fricker’s two-network model,6 and our model. It is apparent that our model
is more precise than the previous models and give a better perdition
of the net cross-link density ratio for all dose ranges. Here, we
use the average chain to represent the property of the isotropic affine
network. However, the real network is generally complex and many factors
can affect the property of the system, including the pending chains,
cyclic defects, entanglements, and so on. The deviations between the
theoretical model and reality are included in the fit parameters,
such as ksci and kxl used here.

4 Conclusions
According to the principle
of the thermal fluctuation, we propose
the fluctuation deformation to describe the effect of the chemical
reactions on the free energy change of polymer network chain under
strain, including the reactions of cross-linking, cross-link scission,
and chain scission. The formation history of an ideal network chain
formed through chemical reactions on n strain stages
is modeled as the function of the mean-square fluctuation stretch
ratio. In our model, the free energy change for a chain formation
is associated with the reaction sequences, except network chain cross-linking,
or cross-link scission reactions under the same deformation state.
Classifying network chains as dangling-dependent chain and dangling-independent
chain, the constitutive equation for network chains formed under two
strain stages is derived in the affine theory framework. Compared
to classical two-network model, the independent network hypothesis
and stress-transfer function are not needed in our model, and the
recovered stretch ratio derived from our new two-network model is
better able to predict the experimental results. In conclusion, the
connection between the fluctuation stretch ratio and the chemical
reactions in our model can give insight into the nature of the formation
of network chains under strain, and can be applied to describe the
mechanical behavior of polymer undergone chemical reactions in various
applications.

Appendix:
Mean-Square Fluctuation Stretch Ratio
After n Times Cross-Linking
In Section 2.2, we consider
a chain formed by n times cross-linking
happening on n discrete deformation stages, where
one cross-linking occurs at each deformation stage. The end-to-end
distance is expressed as eq 7. Based on the definition of splitting ratio, the Kuhn number
of a network chain undergone (n – 1) cross-linking
reactions is A.1  According to eq 1 for one time cross-linking happening
on one deformation
stage, the nth fluctuation stretch ratio is A.2  When the nth cross-linking
reaction takes place with the splitting ratio θn, based on eq 6 and eq A.1,
the mean-square fluctuation deformation is A.3  Owing to ⟨δn⟩ = 0, we have ⟨λδn⟩ = 1 and the mean-square
the nth fluctuation stretch ratio is A.4  Substituting eq A.3 and ⟨R02⟩ = N0b2/3 into eq A.4, we have A.5  The above equation
is multiplied by ∏i=1n–1⟨λδi2⟩, and
it is transformed
to A.6  Introducing
the variables shown in eq 8, we can obtain the following
recursion equation A.7  Using the recursive method,
we can obtain
the mean-square fluctuation stretch ratio as shown in eq 10.
