In the context of valorization of
lignin produced from the pulp
and paper industries, biodegradable UV-protection films were prepared
using lignin and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). Initially, CNC films
were optimized for improving their transparency by studying the effect
of various sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentrations. Maximum (%) transmittance
of CNC film was obtained for NaOH addition between 3 and 4 wt %. The
optimized CNC suspensions were used for incorporating alkaline lignin
(AL) and softwood kraft lignin (SKL) in various concentrations (1–10
wt %). Morphological characterization showed homogeneity of the lignin
distribution in CNC/lignin films. Complete UV blocking was achieved
at 10 wt % lignin (AL or SKL) in CNC films. Cross-polarized optical
microscopy and scanning electron microscopic images of films showed
some degrees of global alignment of CNC rods upon addition of NaOH,
which remained unaffected by lignin addition. Lignin modification
through acetylation reduced the lignin color and improved visible
light transmission of films without significantly affecting the UV-absorption
properties. Presence of lignin also enhanced the thermal and contact
angle stability of the films. This work shows for the first time that
CNC aqueous suspensions with and without containing lignin could be
tuned through the addition of NaOH to produce transparent and homogenous
films, providing a simple and green approach in engineering CNC/lignin
UV-protection films.

Introduction
Biomass-derived
materials are promising alternatives to the petroleum-based
polymers due to their sustainability and biodegradability. The major
structural components of trees and various plants, cellulose, lignin,
and hemicellulose, are the most abundant naturally available biomass-based
materials. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are the crystals derived
from acid hydrolysis of native cellulose with a diameter between 4–25
and 100–1000 nm in length, is rapidly emerging as one of the
most fascinating nanomaterials for multifunctional application, mainly
due to their inherent advantages, including nanoscale dimension, high
specific strength and stiffness, high surface area, ease of processing,
and cost effectiveness.1−3 Moreover, CNC possess interesting optical properties
by virtue of their chiral nematic self-assembly. Controlling this
behavior would facilitate their use in applications, such as security
papers, mirrorless lasing, and polarizing films.4−6 Lignin is the
second most abundant renewable carbon source after cellulose, it is
an amorphous, polyphenolic branched structure formed from enzyme-assisted
dehydrogenative polymerization of the phenyl propanoid units.7 Five million metric tons of lignin is produced
worldwide predominantly as a noncommercialized waste product per year.8 In pulp and paper industries, lignin is a main
component of black liquor produced from the kraft process. Currently,
the primary usage of this lignin-based waste product is to produce
energy. Only 2% of all industrial lignins and 100 000 tons
of kraft lignins available are valorized per year.9

Lignin is a natural UV blocker due to its functional
groups, such
as phenolic units, ketones, and other chromophores.7,10,11 Aromatic structure of lignin can increase
thermal and oxidation stabilities of polymers in blends, and the free
radical scavenging ability of its phenolic groups gives lignin an
excellent antioxidant property.12−17 Currently, organic and inorganic UV blockers are widely used for
the UV-protection applications.18,19 Organic absorbers are
often toxic and degrade upon exposure to sunlight.20−22 Inorganic UV-blocking
agents, such as ZnO and TiO2, are mostly used in the form
of nanoparticles.23,24 However, their higher loading
is required for the complete UV blocking, which often leads to agglomeration,
reducing the transparency of the resultant polymer nanocomposite films.18,25 Some of the coatings developed for the UV-blocking applications
using inorganic particles, such as titanium dioxides and cerium oxide
doped with iron, silica, alumina, or organic liquids, showed higher
absorption in a visible region, which induced the opaque nature to
these coatings.26 CNC can form transparent
films or coatings, and lignin is a naturally available and biodegradable
UV blocker. CNC and lignin can be synergistically used to obtain the
films with high transparency and UV-absorption properties.

A
common challenge in engineering new nanocellulose–lignin-based
materials is incompatibility between hydrophilic cellulose and hydrophobic
lignin. In addition, at normal pH and in the absence of chemical additives,
both CNC and lignin have a negative charge and therefore there is
an electrostatic repulsion between them. It was noticed that nonderivatized
cellulose/lignin films could be formed using green solvents, such
as ionic liquids, but this approach is not economical due to high
cost of solvent.27 Other approaches using
some hazardous organic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide/water
and dioxane/water, did not produce homogenous films.28 To compatibilize CNC and lignin, several attempts were
carried out through covalent bond formation.13,29 Sadeghifar et al.13 have produced flexible
cellulose/lignin UV-blocking films containing low amounts of covalently
bonded lignin. In this procedure, azide-modified cellulose microcrystals
dissolved in dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride were reacted with
propargylated softwood kraft lignin (SKL) to produce 0.5, 1, and 2
wt % lignin containing materials. Cellulose films were then prepared
by regeneration in acetone. Cellulose film containing 2% lignin showed
around 100% absorption of UV-B (280–320 nm) and majority of
UV-A (320–400 nm). The obtained films were uniform, but the
procedure required use of organic solvents and long preparation times.
Another approach reported in literature for covalent bond formation
between cellulose nanocrystal and lignin was using Fenton’s
reagent (H2O2 and FeSO4) as an initiator.29 This approach increased covalent and noncovalent
bonds between both polymers and contributed to the increase in the
water resistance of coated films on quartz slides and in water retention
in self-supported films as a hydrogel film. Natural UV-absorbent coatings
prepared from CNC and dehydrogenation polymer or organosolv lignin
by simple evaporation of the colloidal blended mixture have also been
reported.28 These materials were in the
form of thin films and are transparent on glass or quartz slides with
variable antireflective or UV-absorbent properties, depending on the
process used. In these materials, lignin and CNC are interacted through
noncovalent and electrostatic forces.28,30 However, homogeneity
and hydrophobicity of these materials were not reported. Water-soluble
polymers, like poly(vinyl alcohol), have been used for the preparation
of lignin-based transparent films,31 but
the resultant nanocomposite films were not fully biodegradable.

The present study shows for the first time that homogenous and
transparent films of CNC and lignin can be processed without the use
of organic solvents. The simple and novel approach shown in this study
for CNC/lignin nanocomposite film preparation uses aqueous alkaline
solvent containing sodium hydroxide (NaOH). CNC and alkaline lignin
(AL) or softwood kraft lignin (SKL) is compatibilized in this aqueous
alkaline suspension. The CNC/AL and CNC/SKL films were casted using
aqueous alkaline mixture containing optimal NaOH concentration. The
resultant homogenous, transparent films were characterized for their
structural, optical, thermal, and hydrophobic properties.

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Morphological Properties
CNC and CNC/lignin
films were prepared by casting the aqueous colloidal suspension followed
by drying it at room temperature. As shown in Figure 1a, CNC film prepared at neutral pH showed
iridescent colors. This iridescence is caused by the chiral nematic
ordering of CNC upon drying.32−35 Films prepared by addition of 2 wt % AL and SKL in
aqueous CNC suspension did not affect the chiral nematic assembly
of the CNC and retained iridescence, as shown in Figure 1c,e, respectively. AL is a
water-soluble form of lignin and produced homogenous films (Figure 1c), whereas nonhomogenous
films were obtained for SKL due to its low solubility in aqueous CNC
suspension (Figure 1e).

Figure 1 CNC-based films from aqueous suspensions at different pHs, CNC
films at (a) pH 7, (b) pH 11.5; CNC/AL (2 wt %) films at (c) pH 7,
(d) pH 11.5; CNC/SKL (2 wt %) films at (e) pH 7, (f) pH 11.5.

It was observed that in alkaline
conditions (pH 11.5), the chiral
nematic ordering of CNC disappeared completely and produced highly
transparent films (Figure 1b). Although the effects of electrolytes and pH on the aqueous
phase behavior of the CNC have been studied for the various inorganic
salts, their effect on film transparency has not been focussed. Most
studies involved the effect of small electrolyte concentrations on
ζ potential, particle size, pitch length, alignment and phase
formation in aqueous CNC suspensions.33,36−38 Alkaline condition used in preparing CNC/lignin films in this study
showed the effect of NaOH on the film transparency. This, to the authors
knowledge, is the first attempt to show the effect of NaOH addition
on the CNC film transparency. The addition of sodium counter ions
hinders chiral interaction between the CNC rods leading to transparent
films (detailed explanation can be found in the following section).
It also helped in forming uniform films reducing the shrinkage during
drying. As shown in Figure 2, CNC film with 4 wt % NaOH addition formed uniform film throughout
the Petri dish, whereas pure CNC film shrank upon drying and produced
an iridescent film of uneven thickness. Shrinkage in the pure CNC
film is caused by the hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups on
the surface of CNC. Addition of NaOH introduced the sodium and hydronium
counter ions, which reduced the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl
groups.

Figure 2 Dried CNC films with 4 wt % NaOH (left), CNC film without NaOH
addition (right).

The lignin addition to
the alkaline aqueous CNC suspensions produced
transparent and homogeneous films of CNC/AL and CNC/SKL, as shown
in Figure 1d,f, respectively.
Besides eliminating iridescence, addition of NaOH also helped in uniformly
dispersing SKL in suspension producing the homogenous CNC/SKL films.
Such uniformity resulted due to alkaline conditions, where pKa of aromatic hydroxyl lignin group is achieved.
Deprotonation of this hydroxyl group produced the phenolate anion,
thus stabilizing the lignin molecules in aqueous suspensions through
electrostatic repulsions. Uniform dispersion of lignin in aqueous
suspension is also retained in the dried films, thereby producing
highly homogenous CNC/lignin films similar to those of lignin-grafted
CNC films.29

The root-mean-square
(RMS) roughness of the CNC/lignin films was
also measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The average RMS
roughness values were 7.3 ± 1.3, 13.3 ± 2.1, and 12.9 ±
1.4 nm for CNC, CNC/AL (10 wt %), and CNC/SKL (10 wt %), respectively.
Topographical AFM images of the 10 wt % CNC/AL and 10 wt % CNC/SKL
films (Figure 3) showed
homogeneity of lignin dispersion in the CNC matrix.

Figure 3 Topographical images
of CNC/lignin films using alkaline aqueous
mixtures (a) CNC/AL (10 wt %), (b) CNC/SKL (10 wt %).

Structural features of CNC rod self-assembly can
be observed from
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images taken across slanted
cross-sections of the films. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the chiral nematically arranged rods
across the film thickness are clearly visible. The different locally
nematic layers of CNC are oriented in various directions, giving rise
to overall helical chiral nematic self-assembly. However, in the case
of the films with 4 wt % NaOH addition, these layers of CNC with chiral
nematic orientations were not observed. The SEM images of this sample
in Figure 4c,d, show
few rods orienting out of plane, whereas most CNC rods are in the
plane. This shows that there is some level of global alignment of
CNC rods in the film upon addition of the NaOH. This is also supported
by the cross-polarized optical microscopy images discussed in the
following section. Similar morphology of CNC rods was observed for
the 10 wt % CNC/SKL films (Figure 4e,f), in this case uniform distribution of lignin particles
could be seen across the film thickness. Uniform and homogenous lignin
dispersion was also observed in case of 10 wt % CNC/AL and 10 wt %
CNC/acetylated-SKL (Ac-SKL) films (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Acetylation of SKL did not affect its
morphology and dispersibility in CNC matrix.

images of the CNC film (a, b), CNC
(4 wt % NaOH) (c, d), and CNC/SKL (10 wt %) (e, f).

The thickness of the films increased linearly with
the increase
in lignin concentration (Figure 5), CNC/AL, CNC/SKL, and CNC/Ac-SKL films had similar
thickness at certain lignin concentration. The average thickness of
CNC film was 46.3 μm, which has increased upto 67 μm upon
10 wt % lignin addition.

lignin concentrations.

Optical Properties
Optimization of Film Transparency
To enhance the scope
of CNC/lignin films in applications requiring transparent UV-protection
properties, it is desirable to maximize the visible light transmission
and precisely control the UV light blocking. Since addition of NaOH
influences the film transparency, its concentration in suspension
needs to be optimized to get the maximum transparency in the film.
For this purpose, 1.64 wt % aqueous CNC suspensions with various NaOH
additions ranging from 0.5 to 15 wt % were prepared. These suspensions
were characterized for the ζ potential and average CNC particle
size using Malvern Zetasizer, and the corresponding films were characterized
for the UV–vis transmission.

As shown in Figure 6a, addition of NaOH influenced
the size and the ζ potential of the CNC particles in suspension.
It was clearly observed that ζ potential and average particle
size of CNC slightly increased till 7 wt % NaOH addition; however,
drastic changes in these parameters were observed at higher concentrations.
A small decrease in the average particle size at 0.5 wt % NaOH addition
was observed, which may have arisen from compression of the electrical
double layer of CNC. Such behavior has been described for CNC rods
upon addition of trace electrolytes by Araki and Kuga37 and Dong et al.39 Small concentration
of sodium ions can cause shrinkage of effective particle size through
shielding of the surface charge on CNC. This exposes its twisted morphology
thereby manifesting the formation of chiral nematic ordering. Iridescence
of the films (Figure 7a,b) and their characteristic transmission spectra in Figure 6b show that such morphology
of CNC has retained until 1 wt % NaOH addition. At 1.5 wt % NaOH concentration,
increase in double layer would obscure the chiral morphology by making
the effective rods straight and smooth, which results in loss of iridescence,
as shown in Figure 7c. At concentrations more than 4 wt %, the negative charge on the
CNC surface is completely screened by increase in double layer thereby
reducing the absolute ζ potential. When the absolute value of
ζ potential is less than 30 mV, the van der Waals force dominates
the electrostatic repulsion and thus charged particles tend to aggregate
causing drastic increase in particle size.40 Some studies have also shown that higher concentration of NaOH could
also lead to desulfation reducing the stability of the CNC rods in
suspension.41,42

10 wt %, and (i) 15 wt %.

Figure 6b
shows
the transmission spectra of the films prepared from suspensions with
various NaOH concentrations. At lower concentrations of 0.5 and 1
wt % NaOH, dip in transmittance is observed with minimum transmittance
at around 470 nm. This transmission behavior is caused by characteristic
reflection of light from the iridescent CNC films.33,43,44 In CNC films with 1.5 wt % NaOH, destruction
of chiral nematic structure has led to increase in transparency. As
shown in Figure 7c–f,
films within NaOH concentration range of 1.5–4 wt % looked
completely transparent; however, their transmittance has increased
within this range (Figure 6b). This may have resulted from the increase in alignment
of more nematic domains with NaOH addition. Increase in global alignment
of CNC reduces the variation in refractive index across the film thickness.
This in turn will increase the visible light transmittance by lowering
the dispersive losses in the film.45 The
increased CNC particle size at higher NaOH concentrations caused more
scattering of incident light reducing the transparency of resulting
films. After 4 wt %, the film transmittance was reduced (Figure 6b) in accordance
with the increased CNC particle size (Figure 6a) resulting in hazy films (Figure 7g–i). On the basis of
the maximum optical transmittance and ability to completely solubilize
the largest concentration of SKL used in this study, 4 wt % NaOH concentration
was chosen to prepare CNC/lignin films.

UV-Blocking Properties
of Film
Lignin has the ability
to absorb the UV light due to its phenolic structure. UV-blocking
properties of CNC/AL and CNC/SKL films were characterized through
its UV transmission spectra after incorporating the lignin at various
concentrations. The UV–vis transmittance of the films was measured
in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm, as shown in Figure 8. Transmission spectra
include all of the normal incident light on the films exposed perpendicular
to the light source excluding the absorbed and scattered light. All
of the films were prepared using the optimized (4 wt %) of the NaOH
concentration.

Figure 8 UV–vis transmission spectra of CNC and CNC/lignin
films
with various lignin concentrations.

The CNC films showed a higher transmittance in the UV and
visible
regions, maximum transmittance for this film was upto 90%. The homogenous
lignin containing films exhibited high transmittance in the visible
spectrum and high absorption in the UV spectrum. As shown in Figure 8, CNC/SKL films with
1 wt % lignin contents completely blocked UV-C (200–280 nm)
spectrum, whereas CNC/AL (1 wt %) partially blocked UV-C. Increasing
lignin concentration to 4 wt % completely blocked the UV-C and partially
blocked the UV-B (280–320 nm) for both the films, whereas at
10 wt % lignin concentration total UV protection was obtained in the
both films blocking UV-C, UV-B, and UV-A (320–400 nm) spectra.
At this lignin concentration, visible light transmittance for CNC/AL
films was slightly higher than CNC/SKL. The UV-protection behavior
and visible light transparency are similar to the covalently bonded
microcrystalline cellulose/SKL films prepared and reported by Sadeghifar
et al.13 However, the transparency of these
films was lower compared to that of the CNC/organosolv lignin films,
which have a lower thickness, reported by Hambardzumyan et al.28

Sun protection factor (SPF) was also estimated
using the method
used by Dutra et al.46 SPFs of the 1 wt
% CNC/AL and CNC/SKL films were 10.6 and 13.4, respectively, which
indicates UV-B protection equal to 100 – (100/SPF), which is
close to 91 and 93%, respectively. With 4 wt % lignin, UV protection
has increased to 97.3 and 97.6% for CNC/AL and CNC/SKL films corresponding
to their SPFs of 36.5 and 41.1.

Since UV-protection stability
of films will determine their service
life, the transmission spectra of films before and after exposure
to UV light were compared for their UV-blocking performance for 2
h. As shown in Figure 9, the transmission spectra for CNC and CNC/lignin films did not change
after UV exposure showing UV stability of the films.

Figure 9 UV–vis transmittance
of CNC and CNC/lignin films before
and after UV (254 nm) exposure for 2 h (UVT refers to UV treated).

Birefringent Properties
of Films
As discussed previously,
the transparency of the CNC film depends on the self-assembly of CNC
rods. The CNC rods in chiral nematic films are helically oriented
across the thickness of the film, which exhibits various colors
owing to circular polarization of the incident light,47 whereas for films with fully nematic arrangement of rods,
a linear polarization of incident light is achieved.45Figure 10 shows the transmitted cross-polarized optical microscopy images
of CNC and CNC/lignin films. These images were taken at two different
orientations of the films, which are 45° apart from each other.
The transmitted light images of CNC films at these two positions showed
clear contrast. The overall image appeared dark at 0° position
with respect to either polarizer or analyzer, whereas strong birefringence
occurred when turned to 45° position. This indicated that there
is some degrees of alignment of CNC rods within the film, which can
be attributed to the nematic arrangements induced in transition regime
concentration. The transition regime concentration is where the CNC
rods go from fully isotropic to fully nematic arrangement. As shown
in study by Bertsch et al.,48 this transition
concentration starts at 4–5 wt % without addition of electrolyte
and was reduced to 1–2 wt % upon addition of electrolytes.
CNC and NaOH concentrations used in this study were 1.64 wt % and
16.7 mM NaOH, respectively, which would be in an isotropic regime.
Although isotropic to chiral nematic ordering of CNC rods in this
suspension was hindered due to charge screening, the local nematic
ordering of rods would retain in these films. Nematic ordering of
such CNC domains gives rise to some degrees of overall CNC alignment
in the dried films. Interestingly, lignin incorporation did not hinder
the NaOH-induced self-assembly of CNC. The structural details regarding
the CNC self-assembly have been shown previously in Figure 4. The polarizing property of
the films adds to the functionality of these films making them potential
biobased film material for the applications, such as sunglasses, contact
lenses, windows, etc., where visible light polarization along with
UV-blocking properties are desired.

CNC and CNC/lignin films

Lignin Modification To Enhance the Visible Light Transmission
To improve the scope of optical applications of CNC/lignin films,
it is desirable to reduce the lignin color and improve the visible
light transmission. Several methods were discussed in literature related
to lignin color reduction; however, most of them degrade the lignin
aromatic structure reducing its UV-absorption properties.49−53 Lignin in its natural form mostly occurs as acetylated lignin in
hardwoods.53 However, it is transformed
into the dark brown-colored material during its isolation processes.
In spite of many efforts, the isolation of totally unaltered native
lignin is still a challenge.54,55 Acetylation of lignin
replaces the phenolic hydroxyl groups in lignin with the acetyl groups,
which reduces the lignin color by preventing the formation of quinone
and quinone methide chromophores.53 AL
and SKL acetylation was carried in presence of acetic anhydride and
pyridine. Degree of acetylation of the lignin samples was qualitatively
determined from their Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra performed
before and after acetylation, as shown in Figure 11. For Ac-SKL samples (Figure 11a), a stretching vibrational
band of the hydroxyl groups between 3200 and 3400 cm–1 is eliminated showing complete acetylation of the hydroxyl groups,
whereas for Ac-AL (Figure 11b) there is significant decrease in the peak intensity showing
the partial acetylation of the hydroxyl groups. Also, the C=O
stretching vibrational absorptions for phenolic and aliphatic acetyls
could be observed in Ac-SKL and Ac-AL samples at 1760 and 1740 cm–1, respectively.

Figure 11 FTIR spectra comparison of (a) SKL and
Ac-SKL, (b) AL and Ac-AL.

Figure 12 shows
the change in color obtained after the acetylation of SKL, the dark
brown color of SKL has significantly reduced to the light brown color.
0.1 wt % solutions of AL, Ac-AL, SKL, and Ac-SKL were prepared using
1:1 (v/v) dioxane/water solutions. Figure 13 shows the transmission spectra of the 0.1
wt % solutions of these lignin samples. It was observed that due to
lignin color reduction, the visible light transmission at 550 nm is
enhanced by 65 and 160% for AL and SKL lignin samples, respectively.
The UV-blocking properties of the lignin are only slightly affected
due to the acetylation, the Ac-AL and Ac-SKL can still block the UV
light upto 375 nm compared to 400 nm obtained for AL and SKL. The
extinction coefficient values for the lignin samples listed in Table 1 also show slight
reduction after the acetylation. The UV-absorption properties of lignin
are mostly retained due to the retention of its aromatic structure
after acetylation. Figure 14a,b shows the effect of lignin acetylation on the transparency
and transmission spectra of CNC/lignin films, respectively. The visible
light transmittance of 10 wt % CNC/Ac-SKL film at 550 nm is enhanced
by 67% compared to 10 wt % CNC/SKL film, without significantly affecting
the UV-blocking properties.

Hydrophobicity
Owing to its aromatic structure
and the fewer hydroxyl groups compared to CNC, lignin is generally
considered relatively more hydrophobic than CNC. However, no appreciable
change in hydrophobicity was observed upon addition of 10 wt % lignin
to CNC, as static contact angle did not increase significantly for
the CNC/lignin films. Average static contact angles measured for 10
wt % CNC/SKL, 10 wt % CNC/Ac-SKL, and neat CNC samples were in the
range of 43 ± 2° (Figure 15). However, it was observed that for lignin containing
CNC films, the contact angle was more stable than that of neat CNC
films. Within first 100 s, the contact angle of 10 wt % lignin containing
films, i.e., CNC/Ac-SKL and CNC/SKL reduced to 38°, whereas for
CNC films contact angle rapidly reduced to 25°. In case of CNC
films, hydrophillic hydroxyl groups are easily available for the water
molecules. The water droplet spreads easily on the surface thereby
rapidly reducing the contact angle. For CNC/lignin samples, penetration
into the films was reduced by the uniformly dispersed hydrophobic
lignin network surrounding the cellulose nanocrystals in the matrix.
Unexpectedly, similar initial contact angle of CNC and lignin containing
CNC films may be due to low concentration of lignin present on the
surface of the film.

as a
function of time.

Thermal Stability of the
Films
Thermal decompositions
of CNC and CNC/lignin films were studied using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) in an inert nitrogen medium. Decomposition behavior in terms
of weight percent versus temperature and derivative weight percent
versus temperature (differential thermogravimetric (DTG) plot) are
shown in shown Figure 16a,b, respectively. DTG plot shows large peaks between temperature
range 300–330 °C, which largely corresponds to pyrolysis
of cellulose chains resulting from depolymerization, dehydration,
and decomposition of glycosyl units.56,57 Similar thermal
behavior was obtained for the NaOH-treated sulfonated CNC.58 Smaller peaks between 180 and 190 °C for
all of the samples correspond to sulfate group decomposition, whereas
peaks around 230 °C observed in cases of CNC/SKL and CNC/Ac-SKL
would be due to presence of impurities induced in SKL during kraft
processing.

Figure 16 Thermogravimetric analyses for CNC and CNC/lignin films.
(a) Weight
percent vs temperature. (b) Temperature derivative weight percent
vs temperature.

Thermal stability of
the CNC films is enhanced upon incorporation
of the SL. Figure 16a showed more weight loss at any given temperature for the CNC films
compared to lignin containing films. Peak temperature (T1) from DTG plot corresponding to CNC pyrolysis has shifted
to higher temperature upon lignin addition. T1 for neat CNC films is 307 °C, which has increased to
312 °C for 10 wt % CNC/SKL and 327 °C for 10 wt % CNC/Ac-SKL.
Presence of the phenolic OH groups within the lignin structure and
the aromatic char originating from the lignin at elevated temperature
are responsible for the thermal stability characteristics of the lignin
incorporated in polymer matrix.59−62 Acetylation of lignin further enhances the lignin
thermal stability due to replacement of hydroxyl groups with more
stable acetyl groups in lignin.63 The increased
thermal stability of the nanocomposite films makes lignin-based films
a promising candidate for applications in severe environmental conditions.

Conclusions
A simple approach to prepare the CNC and lignin-based
transparent
and homogenous UV-protection films is developed. The results demonstrated
for the first time that CNC aqueous suspensions with and without containing
lignin could be tuned through the addition of NaOH to produce transparent
and homogenous films. CNC films were optimized for transparency using
various NaOH additions. It was observed that the addition of NaOH
in the range of 3–4 wt % resulted in the CNC films with maximum
transparency. Moreover, NaOH addition enhanced the homogeneity of
the films by uniformly dispersing lignin in the films. CNC/AL and
CNC/SKL with 10 wt % lignin concentration provided complete UV blocking.
The UV-protection behavior of these films was stable under UV irradiation.
Acetylation of lignin reduced the lignin color with only slight reduction
in their extinction coefficient. Incorporation of 10 wt % Ac-SKL into
CNC films increased visible light transmittance at 550 nm by 67% without
significantly affecting the UV-blocking property compared to 10 wt
% CNC/SKL films. Presence of lignin also provided the thermal and
contact angle stabilities. SKL addition (10 wt %) increased the maximum
weight loss temperature (T1) of CNC by
5 °C, whereas 10 wt % Ac-SKL, being more stable, increased T1 by 20 °C. Due to the relatively more
hydrophobic nature of lignin compared to CNC, contact angle of CNC/lignin
films remained stable over time compared to CNC films; however, initial
contact angle was unaffected by the presence of lignin. There is scope
for the further optimization in terms of lignin color reduction and
increasing the CNC alignment. Progress in these areas can make CNC/lignin
nanocomposites a biodegradable, low-cost alternative as a coating/film
material with UV blocking and optical polarization functionality for
sunglasses, automobile windshields, home windows, contact lenses,
and UV-sensitive polymers.

Experimental Section
Materials
CNC,
purchased from the University of Maine
Process Development Center, was manufactured at U.S. Forest Service’s
Cellulose Nanomaterials Pilot Plant at the Forest Products Laboratory,
Madison, WI. The sodium form of CNC were obtained as an aqueous gel
(11.5–12.5 wt %), with crystal dimension specifications in
the range of 5–20 nm for width and 150–200 nm for length.
Some of the literature values are in agreement with these reported
dimensions.42,64,65 Reid et al. have reported aspect ratio of this CNC to be ∼19
with an average length of 134 ± 52 nm and width 7 ± 2 nm.64 SKL was provided by our industry partner, and
this softwood kraft lignin contains 95 wt % lignin with impurities
mainly as residual sugars, sulfur, and ash. NaOH pellets, anhydrous
pyridine, acetic anhydride were purchased from TCI America. AL, purchased
from the Sigma-Aldrich, is water-soluble lignin with low sulfonate
content with an average molecular weight of ∼10 000.

Methods
Acetylation of Lignin
The purpose of lignin acetylation
was to replace lignin hydroxyl groups with acetyl groups to reduce
the dark lignin color, which is partly caused by chromophores arising
from phenolic hydroxyl groups, such as quinone and quinonemethides.
SKL (1 g) was dissolved in a mixture of pyridine (10 mL) and acetic
anhydride (10 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 72 h.66,67 The reaction mixture was then added dropwise into a 500 mL of ice
water to precipitate the acetylated lignin. Subsequently, followed
by filtration and repeated washing with ice water and ethanol.

Film
Preparation
CNC films were prepared by mixing
1 g of CNC in 60 mL of deionized (DI) water with or without addition
of NaOH, whereas CNC/lignin films were prepared by suspending 1 g
of CNC in 30 mL of DI water, which was mixed for 30 min using magnetic
stirrer. Separately, required quantity of lignin was mixed in a 30
mL of DI water with an addition of 240 mg of 5 M aqueous NaOH solution.
The aqueous alkaline lignin solution was mixed for 30 min to completely
dissolve all of the lignin without having any large visible aggregates.
CNC suspension and lignin solution were then mixed together for another
30 min to get the uniform mixture of the CNC/lignin. This mixture
was then casted on polystyrene Petri dishes and dried at room temperature
in a fume hood for 48 h to obtain the uniform, transparent CNC/lignin
films. CNC/acetylated-SKL (Ac-SKL) films were prepared using the similar
procedure. However, in this case, Ac-SKL was solubilized in 30 mL
of dioxane and CNC is suspended in 30 mL of DI water, before mixing
these mixtures together. NaOH solution (240 mg, 5 M) was added to
this mixture. These films were dried on a Teflon mold in fume hood
for 48 h. NaOH and lignin concentration wherever mentioned throughout
this study are wt % based on the total weight of 1 g of CNC instead
of mixture weight. This was used for convenience as each film is prepared
from 1 g of CNC.

Characterizations
UV–Vis Spectroscopy
Transmission spectra of
the aqueous lignin solutions and CNC/lignin films were carried out
using a Thermo Scientific GENESYS 10S UV–vis spectrometer in
the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Transmittance at the wavelength
of 550 nm was used as a measure of film transparency. Sun protection
factor was calculated using absorbance within UV-B range (290–320
nm). Extinction coefficient (ελ) of the lignin
and acetylated lignin was calculated using Beer–Lambert equation
as follows  where ελ (wt %–1 cm–1) is an extinction coefficient
measured using absorbance Aλ, which
is a maximum peak absorbance at wavelength (λ = 255 nm). d is the path length for the incident light, which is 1
cm in this case, and C (wt %) is the concentration
of lignin solution.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the lignin samples were measured on a Nicolet
6700 FTIR spectrometer by Thermo Scientific. A total of 64 cumulative
scans in absorption mode was taken, with a resolution of 1 cm–1 in the frequency range 4000–600 cm–1.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
AFM images of CNC/lignin
films were performed under ambient conditions on a commercial AFM
(Pacific Nanotechnology Nano-R AFM, Pacific Nanotechnology, Santa
Clara, CA) in noncontact mode using aluminum AFM tips with resonant
frequencies in the range of 150–210 kHz and force constants
in the range of 4.5–14 N m–1 (MikroMasch,
Wilsonville, OR). Images are collected at a scan rate of 0.5 or 1
Hz depending on the image size with resolution of 256 × 256 data
points. The RMS roughness of films was obtained from 10 μm ×
10 μm AFM scans.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM images of CNC
and CNC/lignin films were taken using a JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) 7000-F
field-emission scanning electron microscope. Films were sputter-coated
with gold before taking images.

Optical Microscopy
Cross-polarized images of CNC and
CNC/lignin films were taken using a Nikon (Melville, NY) Eclipse 80i
microscope with an LU Plan Fluor 4×/0.13NA Nikon objective lens
and a Nikon DS-Ri2 microscope camera. Each film was placed between
the cross-polarizers, and images were taken in direction oriented
at 0 and 45° to the polarization axis.

ζ Potential and Particle
Size Measurement
The
dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instrument) was
used to determine the ζ potential and CNC particle size in aqueous
suspension as a function of NaOH concentration. Dilute CNC suspensions
of 1.64 wt % with various NaOH concentrations (0–15 wt % of
the CNC weight) were prepared by magnetically stirring the suspension
mixture for 2 h. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C with
at least three experiments for each sample.

Contact Angle Measurements
Static contact angle of
the films was measured on a Ramé-Hart model 200 automated goniometer,
using DROPimage standard software provided by Ramé-Hart. Measured
contact angle was an average of three readings obtained for the water
droplets, the measurement error is ±2°.

Thickness
Tester
The thickness of the films was measured
using the thickness tester from Testing Machine Inc. Reported thickness
values were an average of at least 15 measurements along the film
diameter.

Thermal Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was
performed on a TGA Q500 (TA instruments) under nitrogen at a rate
of 10 °C min–1 from room temperature to 800
°C, with 20 min isothermal step at 120 °C to ensure the
removal of residual moisture.
