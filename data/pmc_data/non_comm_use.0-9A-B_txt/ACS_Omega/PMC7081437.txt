Molecular composition
of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a hot
topic in subjects such as environmental science and geochemistry.
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR
MS) has been applied to molecular composition characterization of
DOM successfully. However, high instrument and maintenance costs have
constrained its wider application. A high-resolution Orbitrap mass
spectrometer (Orbitrap MS) can provide approximately 500,000 resolving
power (at m/z 200), which is potentially
capable of characterizing the molecular composition of DOM. In this
paper, the application of high-resolution Orbitrap MS was evaluated
by comparing with FT-ICR MS in the aspect of resolution, mass distribution,
detection dynamic range, and isotopic peak intensity ratio. The impact
of instrument parameters of Orbitrap MS was further investigated,
which includes ionization, ion transfer, and mass detection. The result
shows that the high-resolution Orbitrap MS is capable or even preferable
for molecular characterization of DOM. However, the peak intensity
distributions are dependent on the instrument parameters, which could
affect the environmental impact assessment caused by the sample itself.
The result indicates that development of a universal and comparable
method is of great demand.

Introduction
Dissolved organic matter
(DOM) is an organic mixture that usually
exists in water, soil, and other environmental systems.1−3 DOM is an important component of the global carbon cycle and plays
a critical role in the global climate change.4−7 In recent years, many scientific
issues relating to DOM have become attractive topics under the situation
of global climate change.8−10 Generally, DOM is mainly composed
of C, H, O, and N with minor contributions from S and P. The molecular
composition of DOM is extremely complex and usually contains a number
of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and other functional groups.11 Traditional analytical methods such as infrared spectroscopy
and elemental analysis only reveal information of DOM on a macroscopic
property level.12,13 The most effective method for
the molecular composition analysis of DOM is mass spectrometry (MS).14 Conventional mass spectrometry, however, has
a low resolution and cannot fully characterize the DOM on the molecular
level. Mass spectrometers that reach the requirements need a resolving
power of more than 100,000 (at m/z 400). Fourier transform ion resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR
MS) is an ideal method for analyzing the molecular composition of
DOM.15

Electrospray ionization (ESI)
coupled with FT-ICR MS has been applied
for characterizing the DOM since the late 1990s.16−20 Though various ionization methods, such as atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization, laser desorption ionization, and paper-based
spray ionization have been used in characterizing DOM, negative mode
ESI has been widely accepted and preferred in the DOM research field.2,7,8,21−35 Although FT-ICR MS provides unparalleled high resolution, the high
costs of instrument, maintenance, and operation have constrained its
wide application.36,37 The Orbitrap mass spectrometer
(Orbitrap MS) is a new type of commercially available high-resolution
mass spectrometer. Unlike the FT-ICR MS utilizing liquid helium to
maintain the superconducting magnetic field, it uses an electrostatic
axially harmonic orbital trap as the mass detector.38 The maintenance cost is much cheaper as compared to FT-ICR
MS.39,40 Since 2005 when the Orbitrap MS became commercially
available, many powerful techniques have been gradually applied to
Orbitrap MS, and the resolution has increased from about 150,000 to
more than 450,000 (at m/z 200) in
the past years.37,38,41 Orbitrap MS showed superior ability in characterizing low-molecular-weight
(MW) molecules and has been used to characterize DOM from various
resources.42−44 Additionally, the high scan rate makes the Orbitrap
MS capable of coupling liquid-phase chromatography to separate and
characterize DOM online.45

Reproducibility
of MS has been a challenge in the analytical chemistry
field for decades.46−49 For Orbitrap MS, as an alternative to high-resolution MS, technology
iteration and upgradation is quick. However, there is still lack of
systematic evaluation of Orbitrap MS on DOM characterization, although
evaluation of early models of Orbitrap Elite MS for DOM characterization
has already been studied.36,50 The resolving power,
ion transmission, and versatile MSn capability of Orbitrap
MS have been improved dramatically, which calls for the demand for
the evaluation of the Orbitrap Fusion MS for DOM characterization.
Instrument operation is a non-negligible problem and affects the results
dramatically.51 Therefore, the extent of
impact caused by instrument parameters to the environmental sample
analysis should be investigated.

This paper will evaluate the
applicability of the Orbitrap Fusion
MS for the molecular characterization of DOM by comparing with FT-ICR
MS in the aspect of resolution, mass distribution, detection dynamic
range, and isotopic peak intensity ratio. The instrument parameters
of ionization, ion transfer, and mass detection of the Orbitrap Fusion
MS will be investigated.

Results and Discussion
Validation of Orbitrap
MS by Comparing with FT-ICR MS
Molecular Weight and Peak
Intensity Distribution
Figure 1 shows the broadband
and expanded spectra of FT-ICR MS and Orbitrap MS. FT-ICR MS mass
spectra exhibited a maximum around m/z 350 and a mass range of m/z 200–800
(Figure 1a). The overall
similar mass distribution of the Orbitrap MS mass spectra compared
to that of FT-ICR MS is notable, despite that Orbitrap MS mass spectra
exhibited a maximum around m/z 340
and a mass range of m/z 150–800
(Figure 1b). This is
expected because of the ubiquitous discrimination of low m/z ions in FT-ICR MS.52 This mass distribution discrimination phenomenon can be clearly
demonstrated from our recent work on characterization of a crude oil.
A comparison between the mass spectra of crude oil collected via the
Orbitrap MS and FT-ICR MS clearly demonstrates the advantage of Orbitrap
MS on low-mass molecule characterization (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Although negative mode
ESI has been widely accepted, the profile of mass spectrum both in
the mass range and peak relative abundance was affected by the ionization
source and the instrument operating parameters.46 Most of the accepted DOM spectra are composed of a series
of peaks ranging from m/z 150 to
800. The peak intensity distribution of the detected masses is bell-shaped
as highly degraded natural DOM shares similar molecular structures.53

MS.

peaks labeled (e.g., 17/9/8 means [C17H10O8 – H]−).

In the expanded spectra, the peak intensity distribution at m/z 341 (Figure 1c) and m/z 521(Figure 1d) shows
peaks at an odd nominal mass. The peak intensity distribution at a
nominal mass is continuous. Both the number and relative intensity
of peaks in these ranges obtained by the two mass spectrometers are
very similar. It should be noted that the FT-ICR mass spectrometer
was not running at its highest mass resolution status in order to
obtain high quality peak shape and stable mass range distribution.

Mass Resolution
In Figure 1c,d, the expanded spectra of Suwannee River
natural organic matter (SRNOM) at m/z 341 and m/z 521 clearly shows
the predominant [CHO] compounds in the DOM, with a difference of 36.4
mDa induced by the substitution between O and CH4. In Figure 1c, the low abundant
peak series, [C17H9O8]−, [C18H13O7]−,
and [C19H17O6]−, and the high abundant peak series, [C13H9O11]−, [C14H13O10]−, and [C15H17O9]− are seen. The observation of these
two series of compounds with different saturations are consistent
with previous research.33 Resolution of
[C14H13O10]− is
310,000 and 360,000 (R = m/Δm50%) in FT-ICR MS and Orbitrap MS, respectively.
Kim et al.54 studied the resolution requirements
for determining the elemental composition of petroleum crude oil.
At present, FT-ICR mass spectrometers with different magnetic field
strengths are configured for DOM analysis; instruments with a resolving
power above 300,000 can basically meet the threshold of DOM molecular
composition characterization.54−56 Therefore, Orbitrap MS can theoretically
meet the DOM analysis requirements from the perspective of resolution.
It should be pointed out that the FT-ICR MS spectrum in Figure 1c is the result of averaging
64 time-domain acquisitions. Benefitting from the long signal acquisition
time, the FT-ICR mass spectrometer performs better than Orbitrap MS
in the detection of low-abundance compounds such as [C17H9O8]−, as shown in Figure 1c .

At high m/z values, for example, at m/z 521 Da (Figure 1d), Orbitrap MS shows good baseline. This is mainly
caused by the root-cut process in data acquisition, which limits the
potential custom processing on the free induction decay signal, like
short-time FT.57 The problem can be resolved
by using third-party data acquisition systems, such as FTMS Booster
(Spectroswiss, Switzerland).

Isotopic Peak
Table 1 shows the
five kinds of compounds from m/z 341.95 to 341.20. Theoretical isotopic peak intensity
could be calculated using IsotopePattern (Bruker) based on the natural
isotope abundance of each element. The ratio of theoretical isotopic
peak intensity to the monoisotopic peak intensity varies from 14 to
19%. The measured isotopic ratio of FT-ICR MS ranges from 12 to 25%,
of which the formula [C17H25O7]− has the biggest difference; this is because the relative
intensity of the monoisotopic peak is only 4% of the base peak in
the broadband spectra, and so the low intensity is of great influence
on the measured isotopic ratio. The measured isotopic ratio of the
other four peaks correlate well with the theoretical value (Table 1). For Orbitrap MS,
all measured isotopic ratios are lower than the theoretical values,
and this is caused by the root-cut of baseline as discussed above.
Certainly, the lower cumulative time of Orbitrap MS affects the ion
detection of low-abundance ions.

In high-resolution DOM mass spectrum, the 13C isotope
peak usually appears beside the N1Ox compound peak at an even nominal mass, for example, an 8 mDa
mass difference is observed between [13CC13H13O10]− and [C13H12N1O10]− because of
the substitution between 13CH and N. The presence and relative
abundance of isotope peaks are of great importance in molecular formula
identification; so far, many molecular formula programs have adopted
isotope detection as a validation procedure.58,59 However, Table 1 indicates
that molecular formula assignment programs appropriate for FT-ICR
MS may not be suitable for Orbitrap MS. Isotope abundance of Orbitrap
MS is usually underestimated.

Impact of Instrument Parameters
of Orbitrap MS
Suwannee
River fulvic acid (SRFA) standard sample has been used widely in the
DOM study; it was selected in the experiment to evaluate the impact
of the instrument setting including ionization source, ion transfer
optics, and mass detector on the spectrum.23,49,60−62 The detailed parameter
setting is described in the Experimental Section.

In this study, molecular information is presented by means
of statistical analysis. The proportional relationship between elements
such as C, H, O, S, and N is the basic parameter in representing the
degree of DOM degradation. In addition, AImod is a widely
used degradation index calculated through a specific computational
formula.63,64 Characteristics of each broadband spectra
were revealed by accumulating relative intensities of the respective
molecular formulae, which had been used in many publications.8 Therefore, the perturbation of instrument parameters
to the signal response could provide reference for the DOM study.

Neg
Ion Spray Voltage
Table 2 shows the amount of O10 class
compounds and some representative indexes commonly used for the analysis
of DOM detected under each set of instrument parameters. Although
the influence of ion spray voltage (group A) on the amount of detected
O10 class compounds is slight, when the ion spray voltage
increases from A1 (2600 V) to A6 (3100 V), the relative abundance
of compounds with a high oxygen content, such as [C14H7O11]−, gradually increases. The
relative abundance of compounds with a low oxygen content, such as
[C19H27O6]−, gradually
decreases (Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information). Double-bond equivalent (DBE), MW, and O/C increase
along with increased ion spray voltage. One possible cause is that
ESI ionization sources tend to ionize polar compounds, whereas compounds
with higher oxygen content have higher polarity and are more easily
ionized, which lead to higher signal intensity.

Ion Transfer Tube Temperature
As shown in Table 2, the number of O10 compounds detected at different ion
transfer tube temperatures
(group D, from 200 to 300 °C with a 25 °C gradient) increased
first and then decreased as the temperature increases, and the main
compounds that changed were those with more carbon atoms (Figure S4). The heat of ion transfer tube is
mainly used to volatilize the solvent for better ion generation. Therefore,
it is possible to explain that when the temperature is lower than
275 °C, incomplete volatilization of the solvent induced loss
of these ions. However, when the temperature is higher than 275 °C,
the ions are prone to chemical changes at high temperatures, resulting
in a decrease in the number of detected ions. However, the change
of MW and C atomic number is not obvious. The change of DBE is consistent
with that of O/C, which proves that the bias of ion transfer tube
temperature on DOM analysis should not be ignored.

rf-Lens
As shown in Table 2, the impact of rf-lens (group E) on the
number of detected O10 class compounds cannot be ignored.
The rf-lens is an ion transmission device consisting of progressively
spaced, stainless-steel electrodes. The mass spectrometer applies
an rf voltage to the electrodes; adjacent electrodes have voltages
of the opposite phase. As the rf amplitude increases, ions of progressively
higher mass-to-charge ratios pass through to the exit lens and move
toward the subsequent optics. Along with the increasing rf-lens (group
E, from 20 to 120% with a 20% gradient), the number of detected O10 class compounds gradually increases. When the rf-lens was
20% (E1), the m/z range of detected
O10 class compounds was 270–545, and when the rf-lens
was 120% (E6), the m/z range of
detected O10 class compounds was 272–569. In addition,
the DBE distribution range of detected O10 class compounds
at 20% rf-lens is narrower than that at 100% (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

AGC Target
The number of ions injected into the detector
cell is of great importance to ion detection; a small number of ions
could not generate a detectable signal. As can be seen in Table 2, with the increase
of the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) target (group F), the detected
amount of O10 compounds did not change significantly. The
change of other representative parameters is not obvious, which proves
that the AGC target is independent of the selectivity of ions as long
as the signal is stable. AGC controls the number of injected ions,
regardless of ion characteristics. However, space charge interactions
would reduce the dynamic range and transient lifetime once the ions
became too dense. Ion injection of Orbitrap MS is determined by the
instrument parameter, specific lens of AGC unit turn on or off, to
control the number of ions injected. Soule et al.46 studied the effect of AGC target on LTQ FT-ICR MS and proved
that AGC target was not linearly correlated with the number of detected
peaks.

Van Krevelen diagram, which takes the O/C ratio as the
horizontal coordinate and H/C as the vertical coordinate, is widely
used to display the compound type distribution of DOM and reveal the
biochemical conversion of DOM molecules.8,11,65Figure 2 shows the Van Krevelen diagrams of the CHO compound under instrument
parameters A1 and E1. It can be seen that more compounds with a low
O/C ratio are detected under instrument parameter A1 (Figure 2a) than E1 (Figure 2b). The center of the compound
distribution under A1 is around O/C = 0.55 and H/C = 1.2, whereas
under E1, the center is around O/C = 0.65 and H/C = 0.9. The compound
type could be classified into lipid, tannin, and other types by their
region in the Van Krevelen diagram by referring to a typical compound
type classification (Figure S6). It is
clear that with the instrument parameter of E1, compounds which are
likely to be tannin and aromatics have higher responses. Figure 2c is a derived Van
Krevelen diagram, in which the relative intensities of the respective
molecular formula detected under different instrument parameters were
accumulated. It can be seen from Figure 2c that the ion spray voltage, ion transfer
tube temperature, and rf-lens have a great influence on O/C and H/C.
While comparing the data of environmental DOM samples, it can be found
that not only the characteristics of the samples themselves but also
the influence of the instrument parameters would affect the results.
Mass spectra are impacted by multiple parameters together, and it
is more complicated while evaluating all parameter combinations, although
the actual instrument parameter settings vary from instrument to instrument.
The purpose of this paper is not to provide parameter paradigms but
to reveal the impact of instrument parameter setting on the DOM analysis.

Application Prospect of Orbitrap MS
As a new mass spectrometer,
Orbitrap MS has been improved obviously in the spectrum quality for
DOM analysis. Although the resolution of the instrument could not
reach that of FT-ICR MS, the resolving power of Orbitrap MS can meet
the requirements of DOM analysis. Moreover, an analytical method such
as liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution MS is strongly
needed for a complex mixture analysis, which broadens the dimension
of molecular composition information. Compared to FT-ICR MS, Orbitrap
MS has a broader application prospect because of its higher scan rate
as well as its detection of low MW ions (as low as 50 Da). It is obvious
that as a particularly convenient and readily deployable mass spectrometer,
Orbitrap MS should be considered as an alternative tool in characterizing
DOM molecular composition. In some occasions, it could provide supplementary
information missed in FT-ICR MS. Considering the lower instrument
and maintenance costs, the prospect of Orbitrap MS for DOM characterization
is optimistic.

Conclusions
Orbitrap MS is a rapidly
developing technology for high-resolution
MS analysis of a complex mixture. Comparing with FT-ICR MS, the Orbitrap
MS has a comparable mass resolution power, an acceptable isotope ratio,
a more reasonable mass distribution in the lower mass end, and a more
rapid signal acquisition. Orbitrap MS is suitable for the molecular
characterization of DOM in various aquatic systems and has optimistic
application prospect in multiple academic communities. Instrument
parameters of ionization, ion transfer optics, and mass detector have
great influence on the results of the analysis. A standard method
should be developed for molecular characterization of DOM as well
as other complex mixtures.

Experimental Section
Samples and Reagents
SRFA and SRNOM samples were purchased
from the International Humic Substances Society. Analytical grade
methanol was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, which was
purified by distillation before use. SRFA and SRNOM were diluted in
methanol to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL in methanol for
MS analysis.

MS Analysis
An Orbitrap Fusion MS
(Thermo Scientific,
USA) and a 9.4T Apex FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) were
used for the molecular composition analysis of DOM. Samples were infused
directly into the negative mode ESI sources at a speed of 180 μL/h.
The mass range for FT-ICR MS was m/z 200–800; detailed instrumental setting for FT-ICR MS is described
elsewhere.51 For Orbitrap MS, the ranges
were m/z 150–800 for SRNOM
and 100–800 for SRFA. The instrument resolution mode was selected
as 500,000. The sampling duration was 2 min for each acquisition,
and the microscan was set at 3.37,55,58 In the instrument parameter evaluation section, instrument parameters
such as ion spray voltage, sheath gas, aux gas, ion transfer tube
temperature, rf-lens, modified AGC target, and spectrums under different
parameters were acquired. Detailed instrument parameters are shown
in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information).

Data Analysis
Mass lists of Orbitrap MS were internally
calibrated with a high-abundance homologous series and extracted using
Xcalibur Qual Browser (Thermo Scientific). After averaging all scans
in the collected 2 min spectrum, noise peaks with relative intensity
below 0.1% were discarded. Internal calibration and extraction of
mass lists of FT-ICR mass spectra were performed with DataAnalysis
3.4 (Bruker). Mass peaks with s/n magnitude greater than 6 were exported
to peak lists. Molecular formula assignments of mass lists of both
Orbitrap MS and FT-ICR MS were performed using custom software. The
typical element constrains (CcHhNnOoSs, c < 50, h < 80, o < 30, n < 4, s < 2)23 and heuristic rules were integrated to eliminate
cases where multiple formulae were assigned to the same m/z.66,67 Also, it should be noted that
all molecular formulae in this article refer to [M – H]−. Relative intensities were calculated by dividing
the intensity of each peak by the sum of the intensities of all assigned
molecular formulae in one broadband mass spectrum.
