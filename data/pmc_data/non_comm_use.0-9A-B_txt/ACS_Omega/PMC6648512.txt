Transition-metal
oxides are considered
as promising anode materials because of the high theoretical specific
capacities. However, the fast capacity fading and unstable cycling
performance restricted their electrochemical performance. To achieve
fast and stable lithium storage capability, in this work, bricklike
Ca9Co12O28 is synthesized via a modified
Pechini method with the assistance of the C12H25SO4Na surfactant. The as-obtained Ca9Co12O28 ternary oxides exhibit stable structural stability,
which may be attributed to the in situ formed CaO layers during the
first discharge process. When tested as an anode material in lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs), bricklike Ca9Co12O28 exhibits an excellent reversible capacity of 517 mA h g–1 at 1 C after 200 cycles. Even at the high rate of 3 C, the discharge
capacity can still reach 392 mA h g–1 after 200
cycles. It reveals a great application prospect in anode materials
of LIBs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The growing demand of
consumer electronics
and electric vehicles (EVs) has sparked a strong interest in developing
high-performance electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1−3 The limited theoretical capacity
of commercial graphite (300–350 mA h g–1)
stimulates the development of the next-generation anode materials.
Among them, the specific capacity of the transition-metal cobalt oxides
(CoO, Co3O4) can reach up to 700–1000
mA h g–1, which is considered as the promising anode
material of LIBs.4−6 Nevertheless,
the application of the cobalt oxides is limited by the poor capacity
retention and sluggish rate performance, which commonly result from
the aggregation of metallic nanoparticles and the huge volume variation
during cycling.7−9 By
partially replacing Co ions with cheap and environmentally friendly
metal ions, the construction of layered Co–Ca-based ternary
oxides, such as Ca2Co2O5, Ca3Co4O9, and Ca9Co12O28, has been taken into account for improving the electrochemical
performance of traditional cobalt oxides.10−12 For Ca9Co12O28, CoO layers and rock salt CaO
layers are arranged alternately in
the c-axis direction. Co–Ca-based oxides transform
into metal nanodomains (Co) embedded in the Li2O and CaO
matrix during the cycling processes, while the inactive CaO is performed
as the structural buffer layer.13,14

Typically, Co–Ca-based
ternary oxides are synthesized via a solid-state route by heating
calcium and cobalt sources at high temperature for several hours.
Despite its simplicity and operability, the products are frequently
prepared with large particle size and inferior degree of chemical
homogeneity, thus leading to the limited electrochemical performance.
For instance, the compound Ca2Co2O5 prepared by the high-temperature solid-state reaction was reported
to exhibit a reversible capacity of 365–380 mA h g–1, which is just comparable to that of graphite.15 On the contrary, the wet-chemical process offers the uniform
mixing conditions and mild reaction environment, which can guarantee
the crystallinity, purity, and uniform particle size of the final
products. Citrate sol–gel method is one of the most typical
routes for the preparation of Co–Ca-based ternary oxides. This
reaction promotes the intimate mixing of reactants on the atomic scale
and lowers the reaction temperature.16,17 For instance,
nanosized Ca3Co4O9 particles could
be prepared via PEG 400-assisted or starch-assisted sol–gel
methods.18,19 When used as an anode material for LIBs,
nanosized Ca3Co4O9 exhibited enhanced
cycling stability compared with nanosized Co3O4 and commercial Co3O4.20 It delivers a stable reversible capacity of ∼500 mA h g–1 after 50 cycles. Recently, some other synthetic methods
have also been reported for the preparation of performance-optimized
Ca3Co4O9 compounds, for instance,
Ca3Co4O9 nanofibers obtained by solution
blow spinning,21 polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 materials synthesized by sintering
and spark plasma sintering,22 and Cr-doped
Ca3Co4O9 materials synthesized by
the thermal hydrodecomposition method.23 However, as for another layered Co–Ca-based ternary oxides
of Ca9Co12O28, the currently reported
synthetic methods can hardly meet the demands for the sake of improving
their structural stability and rate capability. Wu’s group
reported the universal synthesis method of porous Ca9Co12O28 nanowires via microemulsion reaction and thermal
decomposition.24 When operating under the
current rates of 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0.1 C, the discharge capacities
reached 241, 115, 72, 55, 46, and 208 mA h g–1,
respectively. Despite the good Coulombic efficiency, the specific
capacity and rate capability are far from meeting the needs of practical
applications. In our previous work, we fabricated Ca9Co12O28 nanoparticles with a size of about 25 nm through
a Pechini method.13 The initial charge/discharge
capacity reached 908/816 mA h g–1, together with
the stabilized capacity of 210 mA h g–1 after 50
cycles, which was significantly improved compared with other reported
works. However, further work still needs to be conducted for the enhancement
of cycling stability and discharge capacity.

In this article,
bricklike Ca9Co12O28 is synthesized
via a modified Pechini method with the participation of the C12H25SO4Na (SDS) surfactant, which offers
the delicate combination of different advantages. First, the SDS surfactant
can decrease the interfacial energy between intermediate particles
and the solvent, thus achieving the control of crystal growth and
particle sizes.25,26 Therefore, in the as-obtained
products, the homogeneity and crystallinity are ensured. Second, the
reaction kinetics is improved in bricklike Ca9Co12O28 because of the abundant ionic diffusion channels,
thus leading to the enhanced rate performance.27,28 Furthermore,
because of the layered distribution of metal ions in the chains of
polymeric gels, the primary particles can be protected from agglomeration.29,30 To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that bricklike
Ca9Co12O28 is prepared with the assistance
of the SDS surfactant via a modified Pechini route. This work may
provide a novel and facile strategy for the fabrication of Ca9Co12O28 anode materials.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of Bricklike
Ca9Co12O28
All the chemical
reagents
here were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
In a typical synthesis, 0.015 mol of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O and 0.02 mol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water,
followed by the addition of 0.07 g/L SDS. After stirring for 1 h at
40 °C, 0.07 mol of citric acid was added slowly and stirred for
2 h to form chelates between citric acid and metal ions. After adding
0.28 mol of ethylene glycol to the stirring solution under 80 °C,
the polymeric resin was preliminarily formed. Then, the above solution
was distilled to exclude water added at the first stage. To completely
form the polymeric resin, the obtained solution was heated in a draught
cupboard at 150 °C. The Ca9Co12O28 materials were finally obtained after the calcination of polymeric
resin in air at 850 °C for 4 h.

2.2 Characterization
The phase of the final
products was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker,
Germany) with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm).
The microstructure and morphology of the samples were observed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI TECNAI20, USA) and field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS, Germany) coupled to the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis related to the chemical composition.

2.3 Electrochemical Measurement
The electrode
active materials were composed of a Ca9Co12O28 anode, conductive agents (acetylene
black, Super P), and polymer binder polyvinylidene fluoride, with
the weight ratio of 7:2:1. The mixture was uniformly ground for 30
min, and then the organic solvent of N-methyl pyrrolidone
solution was added dropwise. The as-obtained slurry was cast onto
Cu foil and dried at 100 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven before
being assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (MB-LABstar 1200/780,
Germany). The coin-type cells (size: 2016) consisted of the working
electrode, metallic lithium anode, separator (Celgard 2400), and nickel
foam. LiPF6 (1 M) in a mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethylcarbonate,
and diethyl carbonate (1:1:1, v/v/v) was used as the electrolyte.
The galvanostatic charge and discharge tests were conducted on a Land
battery test system (Wuhan, China) within the voltage range of 0.001–3
V versus Li+/Li at a series of current densities at room
temperature.

3 Results
and Discussion
The crystallographic structure of the as-obtained
product has been identified by XRD as shown in Figure 1a. The sharp and high-intensity peaks are
observed in bricklike Ca9Co12O28,
which can be assigned to the well-crystallized orthorhombic phase
(JCPDS card no. 21-0139). It is worth noting that the (010) reflection
shows high intensity, indicating that the crystallites are abundant
in (010) facets along the ac plane. Figure 1b–d shows the morphological characterization
of Ca9Co12O28 materials. As observed
from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 1b), bricklike structures are prepared in
a two-dimensional (2D) structure with homogeneous distribution. Some
of the bricklike structures expose their lateral planes, and the thickness
reaches approximately 200 nm. Furthermore, their evident corners and
edges can also be investigated. TEM images (Figure 1c,d) exhibit the frontal surface characters
of bricklike Ca9Co12O28. It can be
seen that the bricklike structures are mainly stacked by 2D layered
materials along specific direction. The uniform distribution of Ca9Co12O28 samples should be mainly attributed
to the mild reaction environment offered by the SDS surfactant. As
observed in the EDX spectrum (Figure 1e), the uniform distribution of Ni, Mn, and O elements
is investigated, together with the existence of the C element, which
is mainly obtained from the thermal decomposition of polymer chains.
The protective carbon layers on the compound surface can enhance the
ionic/electronic conductivity and structural durability, thus yielding
better electrochemical performance.

Depending on the experimental
results, we propose the possible formation mechanism of bricklike
Ca9Co12O28 in Figure 2. Generally, the crystal growth involves
nucleation and the subsequent growth of nuclei, during which the chelating
ligands play a vital role in controlling the crystal shape.31−33 In the initial stage, under the
action of three carboxyl groups and one hydroxyl group of citric acid,
the metal ions and citric acid form chelates through various reaction
patterns. As the reaction proceeds, massive metal ions come together
in a certain arrangement to form primary bricklike structures, which
are three-dimensionally connected with each other via hydrogen bonds.34 The interaction between positively charged metal
ions and the negatively charged SDS surfactant leads to selective
adsorption of surfactant molecules on the bricklike structures. On
the one hand, the uniform adsorption of the surfactant on bricklike
structures enables their synchronous growth. On the other hand, after
the addition of ethylene glycol, polymerization leads to the formation
of an interrelated conductive network. Consequently, the stoichiometric
metal ions can be confined in the polymer gels, which prevent the
agglomeration of the primary nanoparticles. After the energy-efficient
calcination, the Ca9Co12O28 products
can be finally obtained.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration of the formation processes
for bricklike Ca9Co12O28 via a modified
Pechini route.

The redox process of
bricklike Ca9Co12O28 is evaluated
by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) in the voltage range of 0.005–3.0 V, and the corresponding
data are presented in Figure 3. Noticeably, distinct changes can be observed in CV curves
before and after activation, shown in Figure 3a, which may be attributed to the two different
reaction processes. The oxidation peaks are shifted from 1.967 to
2.054 V, whereas the reduction curves are varied from 0.746 to 0.565
V. In addition, under the fast scan rate of 1 mV s–1, the curves almost follow the same trajectory after activation,
where little changes are observed in the consecutive CV curves (as
shown in Figure 3b).
This illustrates for the complete and stable intercalation/deintercalation
process of lithium ions in the layered Ca9Co12O28 materials. We further notice that the CV curves of
bricklike Ca9Co12O28 are almost identical
to those of CoO anodes.35 This proves that
the stable CaO layers do not take part in the electrochemical reaction
after activation because of the high bond strength of CaO. From the
characteristic peaks of the redox process, the reduction peaks at
around 0.57 V are attributed to the reaction between lithium and the
Ca9Co12O28 anode, which lead to the
formation of a CaO matrix, metallic Co nanoparticles, and Li2O. In the oxidation process, two distinct peaks are observed at 1.12
and 2.05 V because of the generation of CoO. The multistep reactions
on the positive-electrode side of the Ca9Co12O28/Li half-cells can be written as follows20,24,36      

Figure 3 (a) Comparison
between the CV curves before activation and after activation at a
scan rate of 1 mV s–1. (b) Diagram of the five consecutive
CV curves after activation under 1 C for three cycles at the same
scan rate.

On the basis of the first discharge
reaction,
the theoretical capacity of Ca9Co12O28 is calculated to be 636 mA h g–1 (38 Li per formula
unit). However, a lower reversible capacity is obtained in the subsequent
charge/discharge cycles (2 Li per formula unit). This result can be
attributed to the electrochemical inactivity of the CaO matrix.

As shown in Figure 4, in order to understand the electrochemical performance of Ca9Co12O28 anode materials, we conduct
further tests by coin-type batteries. The charge/discharge diagrams
of the 1st, 20th, 50th, 80th, 100th, and 200th cycles at 1 C (C is
defined as 38 Li per formula unit of Ca9Co12O28) are shown in Figure 4a. The discharge capacity of the first cycle is up
to 1287 mA h g–1, which exceeds its theoretical
value largely and reveals obvious capacity variation when proceeding
to the following stages. We mainly attribute this phenomenon to the
different reaction mechanism according to the as-mentioned equation
and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) surrounding
active materials.13,15,20 In
addition to that, the first discharge curve of the Ca9Co12O28 anode can be mainly divided into three regions.20,24 In region (1), the voltage drops speedily to 0.71 V, which is related
to the insertion of a small amount of lithium ions into Ca9Co12O28; in regions (2) and (3), the voltage
remains stable and then reflects a gradual voltage drop down to the
cutoff voltage (0.001 V). These results correspond to the transformation
of Ca9Co12O28 into Co–CaO–Li2O phases and the growth of the polymeric layer on the surface
of the metal nanoparticles, respectively. From the 20th to 200th discharge
curves, the voltage value of the plateau is around 1 V, higher than
that of the 1st discharge curve. This may be ascribed to the conversion
reaction from cobalt oxide to Co. The discharge capacities remain
stable from the 20th to the 200th cycles, reaching 459, 472, 489,
497, and 517 mA h g–1. The cyclic property of bricklike
Ca9Co12O28 is also evaluated under
different current densities of 1 and 3 C, as shown in Figure 4b. Noticeably, the Ca9Co12O28/Li half-cells undergo large irreversible
capacity loss when proceeding to the second cycle because of the formation
of SEI films and decomposition of Ca9Co12O28 into the Co–CaO–Li2O phase. During
the following cycles, the capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency
can remain at a high level even under the large rate of 3 C. After
200 cycles, the discharge capacities reach 517 and 392 mA h g–1, while the Coulombic efficiencies are almost 100%.
We can further observe the variation trend of Ca9Co12O28 from the inset figures, which are selected
from the discharge capacities of 2nd, 50th, 100th, 150th, and 200th
cycles. Ca9Co12O28 anodes experience
almost no decline in discharge capability when the current rate increases
from 0.5 C to 1 C. Under the high rate of 3 C, Ca9Co12O28 anodes still show superior stability but sacrifice
part of the reversible capacity. Figure 4c demonstrates the discharge curves of 0.5,
1, 2, and 3 C, from which we can observe a little decrease in specific
capacities and working potentials. However, the small polarization
at these current densities, especially at high current densities,
demonstrates that the as-obtained samples own excellent ionic and
electronic conductivities. Rate performance, as one of the significant
factors for the practical application in EVs, has been evaluated as
shown in Figure 4d.
The inset figures show the variation trend of discharge capacities
under different current densities. Specifically, Ca9Co12O28 delivers the reversible capacities of 1308,
595, 535, 474, 419, and 381 mA h g–1 at 0.1, 0.5,
1, 2, 3, and 5 C, respectively. When the current density goes back
to 0.1 C, the reversible capacities remain at around 608 mA h g–1. In addition, Ca9Co12O28 anodes deliver stable discharge capacities under different
current densities, illustrating for their excellent rate capability.

curves for the selected cycles at the current density of 1 C, (b)
cycle performance at the rates of 1 and 3 C (inset figures are the
histograms and scatter diagrams of cycle performance and specific
capacity at 1 and 3 C, respectively), (c) discharge curves at the
rates of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 C, (d) rate performance at different rates
(inset figures are the histograms and scatter diagrams of different
discharging rates and specific capacity, respectively).

For the energy storage materials, especially the
anode materials
of LIBs, the main problems are related to the fast capacity decay
at high discharge rates. The possible reasons mainly include the structure
collapse of electrode materials, aggregation of the nanoparticles,
the significant volume variation, etc. However, in this article, the
as-obtained bricklike Ca9Co12O28 exhibits
superior rate performance, which is superior to the most reported
works (as shown in Table 1). The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed
to the following factors: (a) the SDS surfactant can restrict the
connection around the primary bricklike structures, thus controlling
the particle sizes; (b) the stoichiometric metal ions are confined
in the polymer gels, preventing the agglomeration of primary nanoparticles;
(c) the comprehensive electrochemical properties of the system, including
ionic/electronic conductivity, structural stability, etc., can be
enhanced by the residual carbon layers on the surface, which are obtained
from thermal decomposition of polymer chains; (d) in bricklike Ca9Co12O28, rock salt CaO layers and CoO
are alternately arranged along the c-axis direction.
The inactive CaO matrix could alleviate the mechanical stress and
the aggregation of metallic nanoparticles, whereas the active CoO
offers good specific capacity, thus achieving synergistic effect.

4 Conclusions
Bricklike
Ca9Co12O28 mixed oxides are synthesized
via a modified Pechini method with the assistance of the SDS surfactant.
The as-obtained active/inactive nanocomposites are composed of highly
dispersed Co nanoclusters embedded in the Li2O–CaO
matrix. Typically, Ca9Co12O28 is
used as a thermoelectric module. In our tentative use of it as an
anode material in LIBs, we find its good electrochemical performance.
Impressively, Ca9Co12O28 can deliver
the reversible capacity of 517 mA h g–1 after 200
cycles at 1 C. Even under 3 C, the specific capacity still reaches
392 mA h g–1 after 200 cycles. The Coulombic efficiencies
are almost 100% under both rates. Inspiringly, this modified Pechini
method can be potentially applied in the synthesis of other Co–Ca-based
ternary oxides for electrochemical property improvement.
