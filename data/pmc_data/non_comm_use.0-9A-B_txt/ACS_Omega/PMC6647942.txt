Influences of different
enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of konjac glucomannan (KGM) with various
addition proportions on the structural characteristic of gluten protein
and dough properties were evaluated. Results revealed that addition
of KGM decreases the free sulfhydryl and freezable water content of
dough, and KGM with different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees had more
beneficial effects on strengthening the gluten structure by the raised
molecular weight of gluten proteins and the increased disulfide bonds
and β-sheet content, especially KGM with 15 min enzymatic hydrolysis
treatment (KGM II). Besides, microstructure observation and thermal
analysis results illustrated that addition of KGM promotes gluten
cross-linking and improves the thermal stability of the gluten network
structure. Dough possessed better elasticity, as well as tensile and
texture properties with the addition of KGM than the control sample.
And the KGM with 15 min enzymatic hydrolysis showed the most positive
effect on dough quality than others, and 2.0% addition proportion
is the most acceptable.

Introduction
Dough
is a complex mixture of wheat flour and many other ingredients. There
are different processing methods to produce different traditional
flour products like bread, biscuit, noodles, steamed bread, and many
other forms. Assessment index of dough quality mainly includes appearance,
texture, cooking, and rheology properties, among which the rheology
properties play an important role in determining dough quality.1,2 Numerous researchers have proved that gluten protein quality is
an important influencing factor of wheat processing suitability and
has a positive correlation with dough rheology properties.3,4 Therefore, dough quality can be evaluated by the gluten protein
content of flour, which has obvious effects on viscoelasticity and
the rheological properties and serves as a support skeleton in dough.

Addition of various food additives not only affects the texture
and enhances the volume of final products but also decreases the risk
of physical damage induced by different food processing approaches.
Addition of 2.0% trehalose improves the specific volume and granular
structure of baking products made from frozen dough and hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose reduces the mobility of water and restrains the formation
and growth rate of ice crystals to make the microstructure and network
structure of gluten more stable during the freezing process.5,6 In has been proved that pectin and fruit polyphenols could affect
the interactions between water and gluten proteins during dough formation
and bread baking, which resulted in change in cross-linking of the
gel structure and texture properties of bread.7

Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is a typical
high polymer dietary fiber, which was extracted from the roots and
tubers of Amorphophallus konjac. It
consists of d-mannosyl and d-glucosyl β-1,4-linked
at a molar ratio of 1.6:1.0, while β-1,3-mannosyl units connect
to the other side chain.8 The molecular
weight (Mw) of native KGM ranges from
1.0 × 105 to 2.0 × 106 Da and is influenced
by species and producing areas. It was widely used as gelatine, thickening
agent, and water-retaining agent in the food and pharmaceuticals industry.9,10 KGM can be decomposed into oligosaccharides with different degrees
of degradation via physical and chemical treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis.11−14 Recently,
enzymatic hydrolysis has been commonly used in KGM degradation and
KGM skeletons have been hydrolyzed into monosaccharides by β-mannanase,
which catalyzes β-d-1,4-mannopyranosyl into mannobiose
and mannotriose.15−17 The
degradation products with various Mw values
have excellent dispensability, specific physicochemical properties,
and antioxidant activities.18−20 In addition, degraded KGM can serve as a kind of additive to promote
synergistic effects when combined with protein to form different rheologies
of dough.21−23 Understanding
the enzymatic hydrolysis of KGM will be beneficial to broaden its
development scope in the food industry.

In this study, a microrheology
analyzer (Rheolaser MASTER) was employed to analyze the change of
the viscoelastic properties of dough with different enzymatic hydrolysis
degrees of KGM addition. This approach is built in accordance with
the measurement of the mean-square displacement (MSD) of particles
by laser light scattering and gives a deep understanding on the elastic
and viscosity index (moldflow viscosity index), storage modulus (G′), and loss modulus (G″). Based
on the diffusing-wave spectroscopy and theory of Brownian motion,
decorrelation curve quantifies particle motion, which was obtained
and characterized by the viscoelasticity of soft materials.24,25 Based on this result, we can have a better understanding about dough
viscoelastic properties.

It has been proved that KGM could improve
the external and internal appearances of loaf. However, there are
few studies about the influence of different enzymatic hydrolysis
degrees of KGM on dough quality. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the effect of different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of KGM
addition on the structural characteristic of gluten proteins and dough
properties; the viscoelasticity of dough was detected by a microrheology
analyzer and provides information about variation on the texture and
tensile properties. The purpose is to focus on the interaction mechanisms
between different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees with the gluten protein
and dough quality. The consequence may stimulate the progress of KGM
with different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees and lay the theoretical
foundation for the application of KGM in flour products.

Results and Discussion
Effect of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic Hydrolysis on the
Molecular Weight of Gluten Proteins
Molecular weight distribution
of gluten proteins with different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of
KGM addition was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), and the corresponding chromatogram is shown in Figure S1. Protein fractions were divided into
four fractions with elution time ranges of 5.15–8.46 min (peak
1), 8.67–15.91 min (peak 2), 15.77–18.23 min (peak 3),
and 18.17–18.26 min (peak 4). Relative percentage and Mw values of individual fractions were calculated,
and are shown in Table 1.

row of the same parameter with different letters indicate a significant
difference (P < 0.05).

As shown in Table 1, with increased proportion of KGM addition with different
enzymatic hydrolysis degrees, Mw of gluten
proteins showed a continuous increase in each group. With increase
in the additional proportion of KGM I, peak 1 and peak 2 areas increased
and peak 3 and peak 4 areas decreased, resulting in the increment
of Mw. This indicated that with the existence
of KGM, gluten proteins with low molecular weight polymerized and
formed into large polymers and shifted into peak 1 and peak 2. KGM
has been reported to have high cohesiveness and it can interact with
smaller subunits and bind to gluten proteins.9 The samples with KGM addition also showed a continuous increase
of Mw, which was in accordance with the
result of elution time for different peaks (Figure S1) that peak 1 and peak 2 were left-shifted. Partly because
KGM has better water absorption ability than gluten protein, the effect
of protein structure is related to the development of aggregates with
ample space in dough.

For group with KGM II addition, Mw increased significantly compared to other
samples because KGM molecules without enzymatic hydrolysis would tend
to self-aggregate or form larger aggregates with gluten proteins.
This behavior resulted in the molecular chain entangling more easily
and large glutenins not dissolving in the extract solution. In addition,
some researchers have proved that glutenin as a kind of high-molecular-weight
protein plays a decisive role during wheat application processing,
leading to strong elongation resistance of gluten. An increasing number
of experiments proved that high-molecular-weight subunit of wheat
glutenin has a remarkable influence on gluten quality and the baking
quality of dough. HPLC result agreed with the next result of free
sulfhydryl content, and both can be explained similarly.

Effects of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic
Hydrolysis on the Free Sulfhydryl Content of Gluten Proteins
Disulfide bonds and hydrogen-bond interaction are critical elements
to decide the gluten characteristics and influence the dough properties.
Glutenin polymers were formed by the interaction between high- and
low-molecular-weight subunits through disulfide bonds in the gluten
network structure.26,27 Studies show that noncovalent
hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions promote gliadin cross-links
with glutenin polymer. This particular three-dimensional network structure
affords the dough with specific rheological properties.28 Therefore, the effect of different enzymatic
hydrolysis degrees of KGM addition in the exchange of free sulfhydryl
was investigated in this study, as shown in Figure 1. The higher free sulfhydryl values (7.81
μmol/L) of control group than other groups shows that the gluten
network of control group samples is highly unstable. While for KGM
groups, as the KGM amount increased, the free sulfhydryl content markedly
decreased, which suggested that addition of KGM could increase the
stability of the gluten network.

Figure 1 Effect of enzymatic hydrolysis
degree of konjac glucomannan added on free sulfhydryl content of gluten
protein.

With different enzymatic hydrolysis
degrees of KGM added, the sulfhydryl content decreased to a different
extent for every group. Compared to samples without KGM addition,
the sulfhydryl content decreased from 7.81 to 5.13 μmol/L with
the proportion of 2.0% KGM I added and the sulfhydryl transformed
into disulfide bonds, besides the same variation of sulfhydryl content
occurred with KGM II and KGM III added. It is interesting that KGM
II addition results in more significant changes of sulfhydryl content
than KGM I and KGM III, i.e., decrease from 7.81 to 4.92 μmol/L.
After KGM I, KGM II, and KGM III added up to 2.0%, the free sulfhydryl
content dropped by 2.69, 2.89, and 2.85%, respectively. When the additional
proportion reached 2.5%, the sulfhydryl content in increased in comparison
to the KGM group, which demonstrated that KGM I, KGM II, and KGM III
addition restricts the formation of disulfide bond. The result is
possibly ascribed to the synergistic effects of KGM. This protective
effect was relevant to the KGM substitution levels, and changes in
the free sulfhydryl content showed that different enzymatic hydrolysis
degrees of KGM had a better impact on preventing protein denaturation,
especially KGM II addition.

Effects
of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic Hydrolysis on the Secondary
Structure of Gluten Proteins
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy can quickly detect the secondary structure of protein.
In general, amide I band (1600–1700 cm–1)
was used to characterize the secondary structure of gluten proteins,
and the characteristic absorption peaks of the amide I band are illustrated
in Figure S2, which were classified into
α-helix (1650–1660 cm–1), β-sheet
(1610–1640 cm–1), β-turn (1660–1670
cm–1), and random coil (1640–1650 cm–1); the content of these four regions are shown in Figure 2.26 The results illustrated that the secondary structure of
gluten protein in all groups was mainly β-sheet and random coil
accounts for a small fraction. As proportion of KGM increased to 2.0%,
the β-sheet content increased from 39.12 to 40.45%, while with
KGM I, KGM II, and KGM III added, β-sheets increased from 39.12
to 44.01, 45.99, and 40.02% respectively. Meanwhile, some reports
have verified that β-sheet was the main structure of gluten
proteins and the formation of β-sheet at the cost of β-turn.29 So, β-turn decreased from 39.25 to 37.5,
34.98, 34.24, and 39.01%, respectively. The higher β-sheet content
and lower β-turn manifested that gluten structure became more
stable and elastic protein polymerization increased in each group.
Interestingly, KGM II addition has significant influence on the secondary
structure than KGM. This was because KGM would tend to self-aggregate
or form larger aggregates with gluten proteins and attributed to the
molecular chain entanglements more easily.30 And then with enzymatic hydrolysis occurred, more hydrophilic groups
appear and have excellent surface activity to bind with gluten protein;31 thus, 2.0% addition was the acceptable proportion.
Besides, the higher α-helix content corresponds to a more ordered
structure and β-sheet is referred to as the most stable protein
conformation.

Figure 2 Effect of enzymatic
hydrolysis degree of konjac glucomannan added on the secondary structure
changes of gluten protein. The secondary structure contents included
α-helix content (A), β-sheet content (B), β-turn
content (C), and random coil content (D).

Effects of Degree of
Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic Hydrolysis on the State of Water in Dough
Lower-field nuclear magnetic
resonance (LF-NMR) was used to study water migration and state in
dough. A typical T2 relaxation time distribution
curve is shown in Figure S3, which shows
three peaks of T21, T22, and T23, representing
bound water, immobilized water, and free water, respectively.5Figure 3 shows the proportion of every peak of T2 distribution with different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees
of KGM addition.

Figure 3 Effect of enzymatic hydrolysis
degree of konjac glucomannan
added on the water fluidity of dough. The T2 relaxation time distribution includes T21 (A), T22 (B), and T23 (C).

Addition of KGM resulted in a decrease in freezable
water. According to previous studies, a more tight structure of the
KGM-gluten compound could be expected, which can bind more water tightly.
After different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of KGM addition, freezable
water content of the KGM I, KGM II, and KGM III groups decreased by
4.65, 5.88, and 1.50%, respectively, with addition proportion of up
to 2.0%. It is evident that free water in the KGM I and KGM II groups
was lower than that in the control group, which indicates that addition
of KGM I and KGM II tended to lower the content of freezable water.
This demonstrated that KGM could inhibit freezable water flow. Besides,
introduction of the hydrophilic groups of KGM increased with the occurrence
of enzymatic hydrolysis and the substitution of oligo mannose groups
is in conformity with both substituents degree and position, thereby
making hydrogen bonds more complex.31,32 Several hydrophilic
groups exist in KGM molecule, which
bind the water in a certain space and reduce the water mobility and
the ability of water vapor to escape. The unit of water molecules
with the polar and nonpolar amino acids of the gluten proteins was
protected and the bound water content increased. Although high molecular
weight makes KGM have good gelatinization and thickening properties,
it affects the solubility of KGM in water and limits the application
scope of KGM. Compared to KGM and different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees
of KGM addition, the augment of T21 and T22 and the decrease of T23 in dough system indicated that the addition of KGM increases
the ability of gluten networks to bind water. But T23 decreased with different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees
of KGM addition proportion up to 2.0%, while increased for 2.5% KGM
addition, which could be attributed to the high capacity of water
holding, while with KGM added, T21 and T22 increased and T23 decreased with KGM addition proportion up to 2.5%. In conclusion,
if the optimum addition proportion was different, then the water state
is significantly different from each other. So, addition of KGM II
exhibited better advantageous effects on inhibiting the formation
of free water. A change of state of water is the basis of the transformation
of gluten protein characteristics and dough properties.

Effects of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic
Hydrolysis on the Elasticity of Dough
Dough with different
enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of KGM addition affects the water state
and disulfide bond changes, which could modify the rheological properties
of dough. The dynamic rheology results are expressed as elasticity
index (EI) and describe the elastic properties of dough samples. The
parameter EI is proportional to storage modulus (G′) and describes the process of change of sample elasticity
with time. The gradual reduction of platform area height corresponds
to the reduction of the lattice and represents the further formation
of a network structure. And reduction in lattice size corresponds
to the increase of product elasticity, which means that the network
structure is built more tightly.33Figure 4 shows the elasticity
index (EI) values for KGM I, KGM II, and KGM III groups affected by
different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of KGM addition with various
proportions. Compared to other samples, dough with 2.0% KGM II addition
has the best elasticity index. This phenomenon was due to the more
even distribution of KGM II than KGM I and KGM III in dough network,
and it will form a larger gel network after absorbing water. As a
result, it works more effectively with gluten and reduces the probability
of forming large aggregates. So it has less damage to the gluten network
continuity and preserves the higher elasticity of dough. Dough with
2.0% KGM III addition exhibited lower elasticity than samples with
2.0% KGM II addition because the degree of enzymatic hydrolysis increases
with extension of enzymatic hydrolysis time and exposure to more hydrophilic
groups, which may form larger aggregates through hydration and destroy
the continuity of gluten network structure. For KGM I, the molecular
weight is relatively higher than for KGM II; thus, the capacity of
water holding became lower, which causes the gluten protein cross-linking
with a small amount, but is not stable. This result is in accordance
with the analysis of water state in dough.

on the elasticity index of dough. Dough with different proportions
of KGM I (A), KGM II (B), and KGM III (C) added.

Effects of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic Hydrolysis
on Microstructure of Dough
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
was used to observe the dough microstructure. From Figure 5, we can see that dough microstructure
has a continuous network and starch granules were inserted in the
gluten network. Figure 5A shows that dough with 2.0% KGM present numerous aggregated starch
particles implanted in continuous gluten network, indicating that
KGM tended to gelatinize during dough production slightly. Micrographs
of samples with proportions of KGM II at 2.0% (Figure 5C) were similar to the control group. In
the complex system of gluten-KGM, KGM joint connection with gluten
network and discrete starch granules could observe clearness. Figure 5C shows that starch
granules are enclosed in a tight gluten network, demonstrating that
a higher amount of KGM addition binding relationship between protein
and KGM affects the textural and rheological properties of dough.
Li et al.34 applied polymer science technology
to study gluten properties, indicating that the relationship between
gluten and starch influences the behavior of dough system. With 2.0%
KGM II filling into the gluten network (Figure 5C), a stronger stable connection between
starch, protein, and KGM is formed. Gluten network was marginally
influenced with KGM III substitution at 2.0%, which could see the
exposure of starch granules to gluten, losing regular structure in
other parts of Figure 5D. Besides, Figure 5B,C shows that the starch undergoes deformation, implying the competition
between KGM and other components in dough seriously.

of dough with
different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees of KGM added. Dough sample

Effects of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic
Hydrolysis on the Textural and Tensile Properties of Dough
The textural properties can effectively evaluate the dough quality
that takes consumers’ feeling into consideration. Textural
parameters, including hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness,
are shown in Figure 6. Dough made with KGM II obtained higher values than control group.
The total trend is the continuous increase in hardness, springiness,
cohesiveness, and chewiness as the proportion was up to 2.0%.

Figure 6 Effect of enzymatic
hydrolysis degree of konjac glucomannan added on the textural properties
of dough. Textural properties include hardness (A), springiness (B),
cohesiveness (C), and chewiness (D).

However, the 2.5% dough sample with KGM addition has comparatively
higher values of hardness, whereas the opposite effect of KGM was
evident at 2.5% KGM on springiness. The lower acceptability of the
samples with KGM I might be due to its unsatisfactory textural property
to cater to Chinese consumers’ chewing preference. This finding
might infer that KGM addition amount up to 2.5% for dough could effectively
improve dough textural properties. The increased hardness of the dough
samples may be explained by the relatively low water distribution
inside the dough network. Considering the values of springiness and
cohesiveness, a significant increase was found with KGM II added,
supporting the extraordinary influence of the protein network formation.
Chewiness also increase with KGM II addition, but not significantly.
Therefore, KGM II addition was not affected significantly by the water
competition due to the molecular weight compared to the other samples.
Besides, dough treated with KGM III exhibited a weaker influence on
dough textural properties than KGM I.

As shown in Figure 7, dough treated with a series
of KGM (KGM, KGM I, KGM II, and KGM III) exhibited increased extensibility,
extension area, and maximum resistance. The large extensibility of
dough with KGM addition could form more developed protein network
by the KGM and potential better water-holding capacity. However, the
strength of the effect remarkably depends on the special KGM molecular
weight.35 In fact, addition of KGM II increased
the parameters of extensibility, extension area, and maximum resistance.
It also partially promotes a more stable linkage between proteins
and the KGM II molecules. Moreover, addition of the KGM II in dough
resulted in samples having reduced probability of the chain slide
when a stress was applied and easy breaking apart owing to the enhanced
chain–chain interactions between the KGM II and the gluten
protein molecules. The same tendency is observed for the addition
of KGM I and KGM III. In contrast, KGM I and KGM III influenced the
parameters to a lesser extent, with an increase of extensibility and
extension area, respectively, while KGM III addition up to 2.5% significantly
decreased chewiness. Therefore, dough with KGM II addition exhibited
the most acceptable tensile properties of dough.

Figure 7 Effect of enzymatic hydrolysis
degree of konjac glucomannan
added on the tensile properties of dough. Tensile properties included
extensibility (Ek) (A) and extension area
(Ak) (B), which were estimated by calculating Rkmax × Ek and maximum resistance (Rkmax) (C).

Effects of Degree of Konjac Glucomannan Enzymatic
Hydrolysis on the Thermal Properties of Gluten Proteins
To
investigate the effects of different enzymatic hydrolysis degrees
of KGM addition to the gluten protein thermal properties, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out. Tp and ΔH are the key parameters acquired
from the DSC test that are useful to analyze the protein thermal properties,
and are presented in Table 2. As vital parameter, Tp increased
as the gluten protein molecules aggregation.36 Dough with KGM II addition had significantly higher values of Tp and ΔH than other samples.
Moreover, Tp became higher as the additional
proportion increased. However, dough samples with KGM III addition
displayed the lowest Tp and ΔH values than the others. These evident changes demonstrate
a limitation of the network structure formation when KGM was added,
due to the given enzymatic hydrolysis degree. The interaction between
gluten protein and the KGM would be weakened due to the strong self-aggregation
of the KGM molecules. Thus, KGM molecules may appear to self-aggregate
to form larger aggregates with gluten proteins. This phenomenon has
been attributed to the molecular chain entanglements more easily.
In addition, the ΔH values required for melting
the gluten depend on the extent of network structure aggregation and
the internal available water.37 Therefore,
KGM II molecules could interact easily with the other components of
the dough. Finally, addition of KGM II provided a more coherent microstructure
of the dough or a better water distribution in dough network capable
of undergoing thermal resistance. Then, these changes of Tp and ΔH values in different groups
agreed with the results of T2 distribution,
and bound water content was higher in dough with KGM II addition than
in other groups, thus preventing water fluidity.

Conclusions
The effects of different enzymatic
hydrolysis degrees of KGM addition on the water distribution, elasticity,
microstructure, and textural and tensile properties of dough were
evaluated in the present study. Results revealed that different enzymatic
hydrolysis degrees of KGM addition promoted gluten cross-linking through
decreased free sulfhydryl and freezable water. KGM with 15 min enzymatic
hydrolysis treatment showed a significant increase in bound water
and decrease in free water. Besides, thermal tests demonstrated that
the thermal stability of gluten protein improved with KGM addition
and the microstructure became denser. In addition, dough possessed
the most acceptable elasticity and tensile and texture properties
with 2.0% KGM II addition. Therefore, these results will provide the
theoretical basis for KGM to widen its application in the development
of food industry.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Wheat flour with 14.38%
protein, 72.19% starch, 0.45% ash, and 12.83% moisture (dry basis)
was supplied by Wudeli Flour Group Co., Ltd. (Henan Province, China).
The protein, starch, ash, and moisture content analyses of wheat flour
were performed according to AOAC International.38 Konjac glucomannan (KGM) with ≥98% purity was obtained
from Bomei Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Hefei Province, China), and β-mannanase
was purchased from Solarbio Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The
activity of the β-mannanase unit was 60 000 U/g. All
other reagents and chemicals were of analytical purity, and deionized
distilled water was used for all experiments.

Konjac Glucomannan Solution Preparation
Different enzymatic
hydrolysis degrees of KGM were determined according to previous study.31 KGM (1.00 g) was dissolved with 100 mL of citrate
buffer solution (0.1 mol/L) and then added with 0.1 mg of β-mannanase
to start the experiment. The solution pH of the reaction mixture was
set as 4.8 for time ranges of 5 min (KGM I), 15 min (KGM II), and
30 min (KGM III), and the water bath temperature was kept steady at
40 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling after the set time,
and then the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and filtered
through a 0.22 μm poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane
filter. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed
with a differential refraction detector (Shimadzu RID-10A, Kyoto,
Japan) according to the study by Yang et al.39 with some modifications. A 20 μL solution of KGM with enzymatic
hydrolysis treatment was injected into a gel chromatography column
(OHpak SB-805 HQ, Kyoto, Japan), and ultrapure water was used as moving
phase with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min at 25 °C. The molecular
weights (Mw) of KGM with different enzymatic
hydrolysis treatment times are listed in Table 3.

Dough Sample
Preparation
Wheat flour (50 g), KGM I, KGM II, KGM III (0.0,
0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5% of wheat flour dry basis) solution, and
deionized distilled water were mixed and knead for 5 min. The sample
with KGM addition was set as the control group. The total amount of
deionized distilled water added was 55% of wheat flour dry basis.
Dough was kneaded for 10 min with all ingredients. Then, the dough
was covered with food-grade plastic film, fermented for about 30 min,
and then washed by 2.0% sodium chloride solution and lyophilized for
further analyses.

Gluten Molecular
Weight Analysis
Gluten molecular weight was detected by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Shimadzu LC-20AT system equipped
with an RF-20A UV–vis detector (Shimadzu, Japan) according
to the method of Ceresino.40 Gluten protein
was extracted from the wheat flour with 1 mL of acetic acid (500 mM)
solution. Then, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000
rpm and filtered through a 0.22 μm PVDF membrane filter. The
filtrate (20 μL) was injected into the size exclusion column
(BioSep-SEC-S4000, Phenomenex, 300 × 7.8 mm2, Torrance),
and the samples were eluted with acetic acid solution (500 mM) at
a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min and detected at 280 nm.

Free Sulfhydryl Content Analysis of Gluten Proteins
Free sulfhydryl content of gluten proteins was analyzed according
to the method described by Zhou et al.41 Freeze-dried gluten proteins (5 mg) were dissolved in 5 mL of urea
solution (8 moL/L, 1.04% Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), 0.69% Gly, 1.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 8 M urea, pH
8.0) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernate (1 mL)
was then mixed with 2 mL of Tris–Gly solution (1.04% Tris,
1 mM EDTA, 0.69% Gly, 1.5% SDS) and 200 μL of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) reagent (4 mg/mL), and then the mixture was shaken for
30 min at 25 °C. Each supernatant was measured at 412 nm. For
measurement of the total sulfhydryl equivalent groups (SHeq), 2 mL of Tris–Gly solution and 0.02 mL of β-mercaptoethanol
were continuously added to 1 mL of supernatant after centrifugation
and shaken for 1 h at 25 °C. Then, 10 mL of 12% trichloroacetic
acid was added to precipitate gluten protein. The sediment was washed
by 12% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min
three times. The gluten proteins sediment was redissolved in 10 mL
of Tris–Gly solution and 0.04 mL of DTNB reagent. The absorbance
measurement was also recorded at 412 nm. The SHF and SHeq values were calculated by the following equation 1  where 73.53 = 106/(1.36 × 104) and 1.36
× 104 are DTNB molar absorption coefficients, A412 is the detection absorbance of the sample
at 412 nm, D is the dilution factor of the sample,
and C is the sample concentration (mg/mL). In addition,
the disulfide bonds (SS) content was calculated from SHF and SHeq. Besides, the disulfide bond (SS) content was
calculated based on SHF and SHeq determination 2  

Secondary Structure Analysis
The secondary structure of gluten protein was studied using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy according to the method of
Nawrocka et al.42 FTIR spectra were recorded
in the wavelength range of 4000–400 cm–1 using
a Nicolet IS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet Corp.). Gluten protein
sample (1 mg) was mixed with 150 mg of KBr powder and compressed at
a force of 5 kN for 30 s. FTIR spectra were recorded with 64 scans.
The secondary structure contents of the samples were analyzed using
OMNIC software package and Peakfit software (Origin, version 9.1).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry Analysis
The thermal changes of gluten protein were analyzed using a DSC
system (DSC-60 Plus, Shimadzu, Co., Japan) according to Wang et al.43 Gluten protein was freeze-dried and ground through
120-mesh sieve. Gluten samples (3.0–5.0 mg) were tableted into
an aluminum pan (S201-52943, Shimadzu, Japan) and then heated to 250
°C with constant nitrogen purging at a constant rate of 5 °C/min.
A sealed empty aluminum pan was used as a reference. The enthalpy
change (ΔH) and peak temperature (Tp) of gluten protein with addition of different amounts
of KGM were obtained using TA-60 Analysis software (version 2.21,
Shimadzu Co., Japan).

Low-Frequency
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis
Water fluidity of dough
was detected by low-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR)
to analyze T2 according to the report
of Ding et al.44 NMR probes (10 mm diameter)
filled with 2.0–3.0 g of dough samples were covered with a
layer of plastic film. The T2 relaxation
curves were obtained using a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
pulse sequence. Resonance frequency was set as 22 Hz; magnetic strength,
0.5 T; coil diameter, 60 mm; and magnetic temperature, 32 °C.

Microrheology
In each experiment,
2 g of dough was loaded into a 4 mL glass bottle seamless, and the
sealed glass cell was loaded into the chamber (Rheolaser Lab, Formulaction,
France) and maintained at 25 °C for 30 min prior to measurements.
For this experiment, a coherent laser beam (650 nm) was applied to
the sample. The mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the tracer particles
was calculated using decorrelation functions. Three key parameters
were obtained from the MSD curves.24 Elasticity
index (EI) is derived from the MSD curve of low decorrelation time
using the following equation  where MSD is the mean height value of the curve at low decorrelation
times (<0.1 s) and EI is in direct proportion to storage modulus
(G′). Besides, the slope of the MSD curve
platform represents the ratio of the product’s solid and liquid
properties; the smaller the slope, the slower the particle moves,
which means the dough properties are closer to solid state.

Microstructure of Dough
The dough
microstructure was obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
based on the method of Li et al.45 Freeze-dried
dough samples were coated with gold particles using metal spraying.
Pictures were taken by an SU-1510 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi
Co., Ltd., Japan) with a 5 kV acceleration voltage with 2000×
magnification.

Texture and Tensile
Tests
The texture tests of dough were performed as previously
described with minor modification.45 The
dough sample was prepared in the shape of 30 × 30 × 30 mm3, and texture analyses were determined using a texture analyzer
equipped with a P/100 aluminum plate, using 1.0 mm/s testing speed,
40% pressure, 5.0 s testing time, and 5.0 nm distance. The hardness,
springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness were recorded.

The
tensile test was performed on a texture analyzer equipped with a Kieffer
extensibility rig. Strips of dough (⌀1 mm × 50 mm) were
mounted on the tensile grips, using 5.0 mm/s pretest speed, 2.0 mm/s
test speed, 5.0 mm/s post-test speed, 5.0 s test time, 0.05 N trigger
force, and 75.0 mm distance. The Rmaxk (maximum resistance), Ek (extensibility),
and Ak (extension area) were estimated
by calculating Rmaxk × Ek.

Statistical
Analysis
Statistical data analysis for three independent
replicates was carried out and the data were expressed by mean ±
standard deviation. Results were calculated and graphs were obtained
using the Origin software (version 9.1), followed by the one-way analysis
of variance at the significance level of 0.05. SPSS was used to determine
differences among mean values at significance levels of 0.01 and 0.05
for the correlations between rheological, textural characteristic,
and structure parameters.
