There is increasing demand for the
ability to form ohmic contacts
without lossy intermediate layers on both the top and bottom sides
of metal–semiconductor–metal plasmoelectronic devices
such as quantum cascade lasers and metasurface photodetectors. Although
highly Si-doped n-GaAs surfaces can allow an ohmic contact without
alloying, conditions for realizing nonalloyed ohmic contacts to other
n-GaAs surfaces, originally buried inside but exposed by removing
the substrate, have yet to be studied. We discovered that nonalloyed
ohmic contacts to initially buried surfaces with a practically low
contact resistivity down to 77 K can be realized by fulfilling certain
requirements, specifically keeping the Si-doping concentration within
a narrow range of 7.5 × 1018 to 1.25 × 1019 cm–3 and setting the growth temperature
of the succeeding upper layers to a low value of 530 °C.

Introduction
Metal–insulator–metal structures
that strongly confine
light between two metal–insulator interfaces in the form of
surface plasmon polaritons are one of the most fundamental architectures
in plasmonics, metamaterials, and nanophotonics.1−3 They have extensively
been applied to nanofocusing,4 enhanced
spectroscopy,5 infrared emitters,6 and lasers.7 Although
simple insulators or fluorescent films have been inserted between
metals in the conventional studies, there is growing interest in metal–quantum–nanostructure–metal
plasmoelectronic devices: new generation structures sandwiching epitaxially
grown semiconductor quantum optoelectronic devices between metal layers.
Metal–metal (MM)-waveguide quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with
enhanced mode confinement can be viewed as one of such devices (Figure 1a).8−10 Quite recently, striking performance of metasurface quantum-well
infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) was also reported (Figure 1b).11−13 Many of them
are based on Au-GaAs/AlGaAs-Au configurations. In these devices, the
metal–semiconductor interfaces need to achieve electrical functionality
for current flow with low contact resistance in addition to showing
optical functionalities to be able to efficiently guide and confine
the electromagnetic fields. To attain optimal optical functionalities,
the formation of well-defined and abrupt interfaces between the semiconductor
and metals is necessary on both sides. When alloyed intermediate layers
are formed to create ohmic contacts, uncontrolled micro- and/or nanosized
alloyed structures with random compositions significantly degrade
the plasmonic properties of metal–semiconductor interfaces.14,15 To solve this problem, the ohmic contacts on both sides of these
devices should be obtained using nonalloying methods. The separation
between the metal layers (i.e., the thickness of the semiconductor)
should also be as thin as possible to enhance the electromagnetic
field, which requires thin contact layers. Finally, the necessary
ohmic characteristics should be maintained even at low temperatures
because metal–semiconductor–metal plasmoelectronic devices
are often operated under cryogenic conditions.8−13 To fulfill these emerging requirements for standard n-GaAs-based
devices, it is necessary to revisit the classical challenges of the
formation of ohmic contacts to Si-doped n-GaAs.

work.

As is well known, ohmic contacts,
which exhibit a linear current–voltage
(I–V) characteristic, are
one of the most important elemental technologies for semiconductor
optoelectronic devices. Since 1970s, there has been considerable research
carried out on ohmic contacts to the standard Si-doped n-GaAs (100).14−20 Because of the compensation effects of Si, the maximum active carrier
concentration in the Si-doped GaAs is usually limited up to the carrier
concentration (Nc) of 5 × 1018 cm–3.21−23 Because this carrier
concentration is insufficient for the formation of nonalloyed ohmic
contacts, alloyed ohmic contacts have normally been used.14−20 Ohmic contacts with low contact resistivity are realized by depositing
metal (+ dopant) films such as AuGe or InSn onto the n-GaAs, followed
by annealing at around 400 °C. The process produces alloyed intermediate
layers between metals and semiconductors, which are not acceptable
for plasmoelectronic devices as mentioned above.

Metal–semiconductor–metal
plasmoelectronic devices
are normally fabricated using the following sequence based on the
substrate inversion process, as schematically shown in Figure 1c: growth of an initial-side
contact layer (“initial-side” means that the contact
layers are grown at the initial stage of growth) on the sacrificial
layer, device layer (such as QCL and QWIP), and end-side contact layer
(“end-side” means that the contact layers are grown
at the end of the growth) (Figure 1c-1), metal-electrode formation on the end-side contact
layer (Figure 1c-2),
bonding the original substrate to the support substrate upside down
using Au–In–Au8−10 or Au–Au12,13 bonding (Figure 1c-3), etching the original substrate and sacrificial layer (Figure 1c-4), and metal-electrode
formation on the initial-side contact layer (Figure 1c-5). Between these two sides of the contact
formation (Figure 1c-2,c-5), the way for making a nonalloyed ohmic contact with the
end sides (Figure 1c-2) is straightforward. According to the previous studies, nonalloyed
ohmic contacts with low contact resistivity can be realized by using
(i) in situ metallization,24 (ii) doping
of ultrahigh-concentration Si,25 or (iii)
capping with low-temperature-grown GaAs (LT-GaAs) layers.26 Thus, if we can also achieve ohmic contacts
with the initial sides (as indicated by the red dashed line in Figure 1), double-sided nonalloyed
ohmic contacts will become feasible. However, nonalloyed ohmic contacts
to the initial sides have not yet been established. In recent reports
on metal–semiconductor–metal devices, the initial sides
are nonalloyed Schottky or alloyed shallow ohmic materials using Pd
as a compromise.8−10,12,13,19,20 There are several restrictions on the realization of nonalloyed
ohmic contacts to the initial sides. The initial-side surfaces are
first buried by the crystal growth of the succeeding upper layers
and then exposed after bonding to the support substrates upside down,
followed by etching of the original substrates and sacrificial layers.
This rules out the in situ metallization technique ((i) above).24 It is also necessary to grow high-quality epitaxial
layers such as QCL or QWIP on the initial-side contact layers. Therefore,
LT-GaAs with a low-crystal quality ((iii) above) cannot be used.26,27

In this paper, we report a way of realizing nonalloyed ohmic
contacts
to the initial-side n-GaAs layers by utilizing the technique of doping
of ultrahigh-concentration Si ((ii) above).25 We found that nonalloyed ohmic contacts cannot be realized by simply
applying the technique using ultrahigh-concentration Si, which is
effective for the end sides.25 By carefully
optimizing the Si-doping concentration and growth temperature, nonalloyed
ohmic contacts to the initial sides were, for the first time, realized
in n-GaAs-based devices.

Results and Discussion
We began
by examining whether the technique using ultrahigh-concentration
Si, which is effective for the end sides,25 is also applicable to the initial sides. We grew a device layer
(the QWIP structure consists of Al0.3Ga0.7As
with n-GaAs QWs) sandwiched by initial-side and end-side contacts
on an AlGaAs sacrificial layer. The initial-side contact layer consists
of (1) 30 nm n-GaAs (the Si concentration (NSi) is 5.5 × 1019 cm–3),
(2) 15 nm n-GaAs (NSi = 3 × 1018 cm–3), and (3) 5 nm GaAs (nondoped), which
were grown on an Al0.55Ga0.45As sacrificial
layer at 530 °C. After the growth of the initial-side contact
layer, the sample was heated to 580 °C, and the device layer
was grown at the same temperature. Finally, the end-side contact layer,
which consists of (3) 5 nm GaAs (non-doped), (2) 15 nm n-GaAs (NSi = 3 × 1018 cm–3), and (1) 30 nm n-GaAs (NSi = 5.5 ×
1019 cm–3), which were grown at 530 °C.
Immediately after the growth of the end-side contact layer, the substrate
was cooled down to room temperature. The high concentration of Si
(NSi = 5.5 × 1019 cm–3) in the layer (1) is realized by δ-doping of
Si (the δ-doping density (N2DSi)
is 1 × 1013 cm–2) in n-GaAs (NSi = 5 × 1018 cm–3) with a 2 nm separation. The number of δ-doping (Mδ) is 16 because δ-doping was also performed
on top of the sacrificial layer. After Ti/Au electrode formation,
we first evaluated the contact properties of the end side. After the
formation of the Ti/Au electrodes, the end-side contacts exhibited
linear I–V curves with a
contact resistivity (ρc) of 3.9
× 10–4 Ω·cm2 at 77 K,
as shown in Figure 2a. This result is consistent with ref (25). Next, we evaluated the contact properties of
the initial side at 77 K after the substrate inversion process. For
this sample, we bonded the original substrate to the support substrate
using Au−Au diffusion, as shown in Figure 1c. Figure 2b shows the I–V characteristic between the two electrodes on the initial side at
77 K. Nonlinearity is clearly visible, indicating the formation of
Schottky-like contacts. Because the contact resistance is too high,
we cannot estimate the contact resistivity by transmission line model
(TLM) measurements for this sample. It is thus concluded that the
reported method for the end sides is not applicable to the initial
side. A new approach is necessary.

Figure 2 I–V characteristic between
the two electrodes at 77 K of (a) end-side and (b) initial-side contact
layers with a high concentration of Si. The size of the electrodes
and separation between the two electrodes are 600 × 400 μm2 and 100 μm, respectively.

On the n-GaAs surface, the Fermi level is pinned by the surface
states located in the middle of the bandgap, which causes the formation
of surface-depleted region.25,28 To reduce the thickness
of the surface depletion region for efficient electron tunneling and
improve contact resistivity, it is necessary to increase the active
carrier concentration. Here, we calculate the contact resistivity
using a simple model in which the ionized donors are uniformly distributed,
and the surface Fermi level of n-GaAs is pinned by the surface states
located in the middle of the bandgap (inset of Figure 3). The ρc value at zero bias is calculated using the following equation as
reported in ref (28) 1  where mc, q, ℏ, E, t(Nd, E), Nd, EFM(Nc), kB, T are the effective
electron
mass, electric charge, reduced Planck constant, energy, transmission
coefficient, donor concentration, metal Fermi level, Boltzmann constant,
and temperature, respectively. The donors are fully activated and Nd = Nc in the neutral
region (right-hand side of the energy band diagram shown in the inset
of Figure 3) Assuming
that the Schottky barrier height is 0.8 eV, we calculated ρc at low temperature as a function of Nc (plotted in Figure 3). The calculation results clearly suggest that contact resistivity
is highly sensitive to the active carrier concentration in the contact
layers. For example, increasing Nc from
3 × 1018 to 5 × 1018 cm–3 improves ρc by more than two orders of magnitude.
Thus, maximization of active carrier concentration should be implemented
to improve the contact resistivity. Note that the contact resistivity
is also highly sensitive to the Schottky barrier height.

of carrier concentration Nc at low temperatures.
The inset depicts the energy band diagram of
a metal–n-GaAs junction.

We attempted to maximize the active carrier concentration
by optimizing
the doping. As a reference structure, we fabricated an initial-side
contact layer without δ-doping. The initial-side contact layer
consists of (1) 20 nm n-GaAs (NSi(1) = 5 × 1018 cm–3), (2)
15 nm n-GaAs (NSi(2) = 3 ×
1018 cm–3), and (3) 10 nm GaAs (nondoped)
grown at 530 °C. After the growth of the initial-side contact
layer, an imitation device layer was grown on top at 580 °C.
In this sample, the VDP measurement gave a total active carrier density
(Ntotal) of 1.41 × 1013 cm–2 at RT. This density is very close to the
total doped Si density of 1.45 × 1013 cm–2, indicating that almost all the doped Si atoms had become active
donors. Next, we checked Ntotal in the
initial-side contact layer with high-concentration Si (NSi(1) = 5.5 × 1019 cm–3) by adding δ-doping (N2DSi = 1
× 1013 cm–2 and Mδ = 11; δ-doping was also performed on top
of the sacrificial layer) with a 2 nm separation. Although we drastically
increased the Si concentration, the active carrier density measured
by the VDP method at RT rather decreased to Ntotal = 1.33 × 1013 cm–2.
The reduction of active carrier density indicates that NSi(1) = 5.5 × 1019 cm–3 is too high, and the carrier compensation effects (formation of
Si on As-site, Si–Si pairs, or Si–X centers) become
dominant.23

To maximize the active
carrier concentration, therefore, we investigated
the lower Si-doping concentration conditions. We fabricated a series
of samples in which initial-side contact layers consisted of (1) 20
nm n-GaAs (NSi(1) = 5–17.5
× 1018 cm–3), (2) 15 nm n-GaAs (NSi(2) = 3 × 1018 cm–3), and (3) 10 nm GaAs (nondoped). In the layer (1),
δ-doping of Si (N2DSi = 0–5
× 1012 cm–2) was performed with
a 4 nm separation to realize a moderately high concentration of Si.
The δ-doping was also applied to the sacrificial layer (Mδ = 6). After the growth, imitation device
layers were grown on top at 580 °C. Figure 4 shows the carrier density of the samples
at RT measured using  van der Pauw (VDP) method. On increasing NSi(1) from 0.5 × 1019 to 1.25 × 1019 cm–3, Ntotal increases from 1.41 × 1013 to 1.93
× 1013 cm–2. However, further increasing NSi(1) results in a decrease in Ntotal to 1.67 × 1013 cm–2. This result reveals that the active carrier density
peaks when NSi(1) is around
1.25 × 1019 cm–3 (N2DSi = 3 × 1012 cm–2).

Figure 4 Total active carrier density Ntotal at
RT as a function of Si concentration in layer (1) NSi(1).

Using the sample with the maximum carrier concentration (NSi(1) = 1.25 × 1019 cm–3), we evaluated ρc of the
initial-side contact layer by the TLM measurement after the substrate
inversion process, as shown in Figure 10c. From here, the thickness of the layer
(1) is fixed at 28 nm, and δ-doping of Si (N2DSi = 3 × 1012 cm–2 and Mδ = 7) was performed with
a 4 nm separation. No δ-doping was performed on the sacrificial
layers. The details of the structure of the initial-side contact layer
are as follows: (1) 28 nm n-GaAs (NSi(1) = 1.25 × 1019 cm–3),
(2) 15 nm n-GaAs (NSi(2) =
3 × 1018 cm–3), and (3) 10 nm GaAs
(nondoped). As seen in Figure 5a, the I–V curve
between the two electrodes exhibits a linear property at RT in a range
of ±0.3 V, indicating ohmic characteristics in this range. The
value of ρc measured by TLM is 2.0 × 10–1 Ω·cm2. At 77 K, however, ρc increases to 6.4 Ω·cm2, and a nonlinear
property was observed. The contact resistivity is therefore improved
by optimizing the Si-doping concentration. However, it is still insufficient
to realize an ohmic contact at low temperatures.

Figure 5 I–V curves between two
electrodes. The upper layers were grown at (a) 580 °C and (b)
530 °C. The size of the electrodes and separation between the
two electrodes are 600 × 400 μm2 and 100 μm,
respectively.

We attributed the observed
difference in contact resistivity between
the end-side and initial-side contacts to changes caused by annealing.
Although the samples were cooled down immediately after the growth
of the end-side contact layers, the initial-side contact layers are
annealed at 580 °C during the growth of the imitation device
layers. To suppress these temperature-induced changes, we also grew
the upper imitation device layer at 530 °C for the next step.
At 530 °C, we can still maintain the quality of GaAs and AlGaAs
at a reasonably high level. By reducing the temperature for the imitation
device layer growth from 580 °C to 530 °C, we found that Ntotal measured by VDP slightly increased from
2.02 × 1013 to 2.33 × 1013 cm–2. The increase in carrier density at a lower growth
temperature is consistent with that reported in the literature.29Figure 5b shows the I–V curves
between the two electrodes at RT and 77 K of the sample in which the
upper layer was grown at 530 °C. It is now clear that the nearly
linear I–V curve is maintained
in a range of ±0.3 V down to 77 K, indicating the realization
of a nonalloyed ohmic contact in this range even at 77 K. The ρc values at RT and 77 K are 2.0 × 10–2 and 1.1 × 10–1 Ω·cm2, respectively. It should be noted that the I–V curve at 77 K exhibits nonlinear characteristics in the
high voltage region (|V| > 0.3 V) while linearity
nearly maintains at RT, as shown in the inset of Figure 5b. When a higher voltage is
applied to the triangular barrier (as shown in the inset of Figure 3), the effective
thickness of the barrier for tunneling becomes thinner, resulting
in the nonlinear increase of current. However, the obtained ohmic
properties in a range of ±0.3 V at 77 K are good enough for many
GaAs-based plasmoelectronic device applications because their device
core layers exhibit relatively high resistance.30 We additionally point out that further improvement of the
contact properties might be obtained by tuning the Schottky barrier
heights if necessary.31,32

For the further understanding
of the effects of the annealing temperature
on contact resistivity, we checked the Si depth profiles using secondary
ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The SIMS measurements were performed
on the samples after the substrate inversion process (Figure 10c) whose I–V curves are shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the Si depth profiles. The high Si concentration
observed at the surface region (0–3 nm) is due to surface contamination
and is not discussed. On decreasing temperature from 580 °C to
530 °C, the lack of diffusion of Si into the nondoped GaAs layer
is clearly visible. Suppression of diffusion causes an increase in
Si concentration in the highly Si-doped layer (1) (+20%). Here, we
additionally noted that Si diffusion into AlGaAs (the device layer)
is highly suppressed in the sample grown at 530 °C. This is important
for improving the device’s performance, such as by reducing
the leakage current in the photodetectors.

Figure 6 Log plot of Si concentration NSi depth
profiles of the samples in which the upper layers of the initial-side
contact layers are grown at 580 °C (red) and 530 °C (blue).
The measurements were performed after the substrate inversion process.
The inset shows a linear plot around the surfaces.

Because the SIMS measurement cannot distinguish
the activation
state of Si atoms, we also evaluated the depth profiles of active
carrier density by the VDP measurements combined with step-by-step
etching (the details are explained in the Experimental
Section below). In addition to the two samples of initial-side
contacts (whose upper device imitation layers were grown at 530 °C
and 580 °C) after the substrate inversion process, we also performed
the same experiment on the end-side contact in which the same layer
structure was grown at 530 °C ((1) 10 nm GaAs (nondoped), (2)
15 nm n-GaAs (NSi(2) = 3 ×
1018 cm–3), and (3) 28 nm n-GaAs (NSi(1) = 1.25 × 1019 cm–3 at 530 °C)). Figure 7 shows the plot of the reduction of Ntotal (ΔNtotal) by each 2 nm-thick etching step. It is clear that the active carrier
density of the top part of the initial-side contact in which the upper
layer was grown at 530 °C is higher than that of the initial-side
contact in which the upper layer was grown at 580 °C (+60–80%).
This carrier density difference is larger than the Si concentration
difference (+20%), which is possibly due to the inactivation of doped
Si (compensation effects) by high temperature annealing in addition
to the effects of diffusion.29,33 From the results, it
is reasonable to conclude that the actual carrier volume density in
the highly Si-doped layer (1) increased (+60–80%) by reducing
the growth temperature. According to our calculations of the contact
resistivity in the above section, the change is likely to result in
a significant change in the contact resistivity.

Figure 7 Plot of active carrier
density difference ΔNtotal of the initial-side contacts
in which the upper layers of the initial-side
contact layers are grown at 580 °C (red), 530 °C (blue),
and end-side contact (black). The measurements for the initial-side
contacts were performed after the substrate inversion process.

Another noteworthy feature observed
in Figure 7 is that
the carrier concentration in the
top part of the end-side contact is much higher than those in the
initial-side contacts. Most probably, this high carrier concentration
is the main reason why it is easy to obtain a nonalloyed ohmic contact
to the end side. During the growth of Si-doped GaAs, surface segregation
of Si occurs, resulting in the high Si concentration at the top part
of the end-side contact.34 In addition,
the end-side contact is cooled down immediately after the growth,
which suppresses the inactivation of Si (compensation effects).29,33 In contrast, the surface segregation of Si reduces the Si concentration
at the surfaces of initial-side contacts. Also, the initial-side contacts
are inevitably annealed for the growth of upper layers. These make
it difficult to obtain low-resistance Ohmic properties at the initial-side
contacts. Therefore, decreasing the growth temperature for the contact
layers and upper layers is highly important for minimizing these effects
while the crystal quality of the upper layer should also be taken
into account.

To minimize ρc, we investigated
ρc as a function of NSi(1) controlled
by the δ-doping density per layer (N2DSi). Except for the Si concentration, the growth conditions are the
same as with the sample shown in Figure 5b (the upper layers were grown at 530 °C). Figure 8a shows ρc of samples with various NSi(1) at RT and 77 K. When NSi(1) is tuned
in a range of 0.75 × 1019 to 1.25 × 1019 cm–3, nonalloyed ohmic contacts are realized down
to 77 K in a range of ±0.3 V. In contrast, with higher or lower NSi(1), ρc exhibits
high values. Optimal contact resistivity was obtained at NSi(1) = 7.5 × 1018 cm–3 (ρc = 8.5 × 10–3 Ω·cm2 at RT and ρc = 4.1 × 10–2 Ω·cm2 at 77 K), where N2DSi per layer is 1 × 1012 cm–2. Figure 9 shows the I–V curves between the two electrodes
at RT and 77 K of the optimal initial-side contact. Although small
nonlinearity is still visible in the high voltage region at 77 K,
ohmic property is further improved compared with Figure 5b.

Figure 8 (a) Contact resistivity
ρc at RT and 77 K and
(b) total active carrier density Ntotal at RT as a function of the Si concentration in layer (1) NSi(1). When ρc is
higher than −1.5 × 10–1 Ω·cm2, nonlinear I–V curves
were observed, indicating a Schottky-like contact.

Figure 9 I–V curves between
two
electrodes at RT and 77 K. NSi(1) is 7.5 × 1018 cm–3 and the upper
layers were grown at 530 °C. The size of the electrodes and separation
between the two electrodes are 600 × 400 μm2 and 100 μm, respectively.

Finally, we would like to note an additional factor that
has significant
effects on contact resistivity. The total active carrier density of
the sample with NSi(1) = 7.5
× 1018 cm–3 (which exhibits the
best contact resistivity) is Ntotal =
2.09 × 1013 cm–2, which is lower
than that of the sample with NSi(1) = 1.25 × 1019 cm–3 (Ntotal = 2.33 × 1013 cm–2), as shown in Figure 8b. In addition, the total active carrier density of the sample with NSi(1) = 3 × 1019 cm–3 is higher than that of the sample with NSi(1) = 5 × 1018 cm–3 (Ntotal = 1.84 × 1013 and 1.59 × 1013 cm–2). However,
the contact resistivity at RT of the former sample is higher than that of the latter sample
(ρc = 2.2 × 10–1 as compared
with 5.7 × 10–2 Ω·cm2). It has been reported that high doping of Si and/or annealing results
in changes in the Si configurations in the GaAs.23,33,35,36 These changes
possibly modify the electronic structures of n-GaAs, which in turn
would affect the contact resistivity. To verify if this is the case,
however, further studies will be needed.

Hence, tuning NSi(1) to
within a narrow range of 7.5 × 1018 to 1.25 ×
1019 cm–3 and maintaining a slightly
low substrate temperature of 530 °C are the keys to the creation
of an initial-side nonalloyed ohmic contact.

Although the obtained
contact resistivities are not as low as the
typical values (ρc = 10–6–10–7 Ω·cm2) for the
alloyed ohmic contacts to n-GaAs and small nonlinearity appears in
the high voltage region at 77 K, the values are still in the acceptable
range for specific applications such as metasurface QWIPs.

Conclusions
We have realized nonalloyed ohmic contacts on buried n-GaAs that
appear after bonding the original substrates to support substrates
with an upside-down configuration, followed by etching the substrates
and sacrificial layers. An end-side nonalloyed ohmic contact is easily
obtained by doping with ultrahigh density Si as reported previously.
When similar structures are applied to the initial-side contact, however,
the contacts become a Schottky-like contact. For the initial side,
we found that moderate Si-doping density, which is lower than that
for the end side, is necessary. The temperature for the growth of
upper device layers on the initial-side contact layers is critically
important for the suppression of Si diffusion and inactivation. Nonalloyed
ohmic contacts in a range of ±0.3 V that operate from RT to 77
K can be obtained by tuning the concentration of doped Si to within
a narrow range of NSi = 7.5 × 1018–1.25 × 1019 cm–3 and reducing the substrate temperature during the growth of the
upper device layers from 580 to 530 °C. The optimal contact resistivity
obtained in this study is ρc = 8.5
× 10–3 Ω·cm2 at RT and ρc = 4.1 × 10–2 Ω·cm2 at 77 K for NSi = 7.5 ×
1018 cm–3. Our results show that double-sided
nonalloyed ohmic contacts to Si-doped GaAs are feasible in which ohmic
contacts are realized on both sides without the formation of an intermediate
alloyed layer for metal–semiconductor–metal plasmoelectronic
device applications. The required thickness for a contact layer is
only 53 nm, which contributes to the realization of thin semiconductor
layers enabling higher field enhancement.

Experimental Section
The samples were grown on semi-insulating GaAs (100) substrates
using a solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. Typical
sample structures for the evaluation of initial-side contacts are
shown schematically in Figure 10a. After the growth of GaAs
buffer and Al0.9Ga0.1As (and Al0.55Ga0.45As) sacrificial layers, the n-GaAs initial-side
contact layer was grown at 530 °C. The contact layer consists
of (1) a highly Si-doped GaAs layer (Si concentration NSi ≥ 5 × 1018 cm–3), (2) n-GaAs (NSi = 3 × 1018 cm–3), and (3) GaAs (nondoped). To minimize
Si segregation from the layer (1) to the device layer grown on top
of them, we inserted layers (2) and (3). Next, a device layer (or
imitation device layer) consisting of Al0.3Ga0.7As and GaAs layers was grown at 580 °C or 530 °C. Note
that 580 °C is the typical growth temperature for high-quality
GaAs and AlGaAs by MBE.37−39 To increase the number of Si
atoms substituted for Ga, the layer (1) was grown at somewhat low
temperature of 530 °C, and a δ-doping technique was used
to increase Si.29,40 During the growth of n-GaAs (NSi = 5 × 1018 cm–3), we interrupted the growth and performed δ-doping of Si (N2DSi = 0–1 × 1013 cm–2) with 2–4 nm separations.

Figure 10 Schematic illustrations
of samples and their fabrication process.
(a) Sample structures after MBE growth and (b) samples with InSn electrodes
for VDP measurements. (c) For the I–V characteristic and TLM measurements, the substrate inversion
process was applied: (c-1) the MBE-grown samples were bonded to the
support substrates using glue upside down, (c-2) followed by etching
of the substrates and sacrificial layers, and (c-3) formation of Ti/Au
electrodes. The red dashed lines indicate the surfaces of the initial-side
contacts.

The total active carrier density
(Ntotal, cm–2) in the
contact layers (layers (1), (2),
and (3)) was checked using conventional van der Pauw (VDP) methods.
For the measurements, InSn was thermally diffused from the top surfaces
at 420–450 °C, as shown in Figure 10b.

For evaluation of contact resistivity,
the original substrates
were bonded to the support GaAs substrates using glue upside down
(Figure 10c-1), followed
by removal of the GaAs original substrates and AlGaAs sacrificial
layers by mechanical and chemical etching (Figure 10c-2). Ti/Au metals were then evaporated
to the exposed initial-side contact layers (1) for electrode formation
(Figure 10c-3). The
samples were not annealed after metal deposition. The I–V curves are obtained in between the two
electrodes. The contact resistivity (ρc, Ω·cm2) was estimated using the transmission
line model (TLM) measurement.41 The values
of ρc were estimated by fitting
the values of resistance between the electrodes with different separations.

The depth profiles of the doped Si density were measured using
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The depth profiles of the
active carrier density were evaluated by the VDP method combined with
step-by-step etching of the sample surfaces by 2.3% tetramethylammonium
hydroxide solution. Each time after the 2 nm-thick etching (the etching
time was 1 min), we measured the total active carrier density (Ntotal, cm–2) by the VDP measurement.
By calculating the difference of Ntotal (cm–2) before and after each etching step (ΔNtotal), we evaluated the active carrier area
density in the etched 2 nm-thick layers.
