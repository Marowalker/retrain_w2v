The
emergence of a new class of novel psychoactive substances, N-benzyl-substituted phenethylamine derivatives so-called
“NBOMes” or “Smiles”, in the recreational
drug market has forced the development of new sensitive analytical
methodologies for their detection and quantitation. NBOMes’
hallucinogenic effects mimic those of the illegal psychedelic drug
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and are typically sold as LSD on
blotter papers, resulting in a remarkable number of fatalities worldwide.
In this article, four halide derivatives of NBOMe, namely, 2-(4-fluoro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine, 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine, 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine, and 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine, were detected and quantified
simultaneously using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method,
and two detection systems were compared: photodiode array detection
(detection system I) and amperometric detection via a commercially
available impinging jet flow-cell system incorporating embedded graphite
screen-printed macroelectrodes (detection system II). Under optimized
experimental conditions, linear calibration plots were obtained in
the concentration range of 10–300 and 20–300 μg
mL–1, for detection systems I and II, respectively.
Detection limit (limit of detection) values were between 4.6–6.7
and 9.7–18 μg mL–1, for detection systems
I and II, respectively. Both detectors were employed for the analysis
of the four NBOMe derivatives in the bulk form, in the presence of
LSD and adulterants commonly found in street samples (e.g. paracetamol,
caffeine, and benzocaine). Furthermore, the method was applied for
the analysis of simulated blotter papers, and the obtained percentage
recoveries were satisfactory, emphasizing its advantageous applicability
for the routine analysis of NBOMes in forensic laboratories.

Introduction
Over the last decade,
the use of the so-called new psychoactive
substances (NPSs) has escalated in an unprecedented rate worldwide,
posing a significant risk to public health and to drug control agencies.1 NPSs are considered to be legal alternatives
to illicit drugs and are synthetically designed to mimic their structure
and euphoric effects but are not controlled under the Misuse of Drug
Act.2 By the beginning of 2010, a new group
of NPSs, commonly described as “NBOMes”, “N-Bombs”,
“Smiles”, or “Solaris”, has emerged into
the drug market and Internet vendors, resulting in several cases of
intoxication and fatalities.3−8

NBOMes are N-benzylmethoxy-derivatives of
the
2C–X series of psychoactive phenethylamines with methoxy substitutions
at positions 2 and 5 and a substitution at position 4, often consisting
of a halogen (i.e., fluoride, chloride, bromide, or iodide).9 The four most common NBOMe derivatives include
(see Scheme 1) 2-(4-fluoro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine (2a, 25F-NBOMe),
2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine
(2b, 25C-NBOMe·HCl), 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine (2c, 25B-NBOMe),
and 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethan-1-amine
(2d, 25I-NBOMe), which is the most popular member of
this family among drug abusers.9 They are
potent agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and even doses in
micrograms can produce psychoactive effects.10 NBOMes were first synthesized in the early 2000s by Ralf Heim as
a pharmacological tool to study the 5-HT2A receptor.11 However, NBOMe’s use for recreational
purposes had never been reported before 2010 when they started to
be available through the Internet.9 They
are considered as hallucinogenic stimulants that can induce euphoria,
hallucination, agitation, tachycardia, serotonin-like syndrome, seizures,
intoxication, and eventually death.5,12−14 These hallucinogenic properties resemble those of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) (Scheme 1); wherefore, they are commonly sold as LSD on blotter papers
taken sublingually or by nasal insufflations.14−17

In 2013,
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration temporarily controlled 2b–d as schedule I illegal drugs, for
2 years under the Controlled Substances Act.18 In June 2014, the UK permanently controlled NBOMes and listed them
as class A substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971).19 Later, in November 2014, the World Health Organization
in Geneva has placed NBOMe derivatives under international control.20 Currently, the U.S. is listing the previously
mentioned NBOMe derivatives under schedule I controlled substances
according to the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) published
in November 2018.21 Hence, there is a requirement
for the development of simple analytical methodologies for the detection
and quantification of such illicit drugs to restrict their commercialization
and abuse. Analysis of NBOMe derivatives, by validated analytical
procedures or in individual case reports, has been extensively performed
using a range of analytical approaches (see Table 1 for a summary), such as liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS),11,22−31 ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(UPLC–MS/MS),4,32−34 gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS),15 and paper
spray ionization-mass spectrometry (PSI-MS).35 In addition to attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR),36 high-performance
liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD)37 and high-performance thin-layer chromatography
(HPTLC)38,39 have been previously introduced as standardized
protocols for the qualitative and/or the quantitative analysis of
NBOMes (Table 1). Other
approaches have reported the use of electrochemical methodologies
including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using screen-printed
carbon electrodes (SPEs)9 and square wave
voltammetry (SWV) utilizing glassy carbon12 and boron-doped diamond40,41 as working electrodes.
These reported electrochemical methodologies have the limitation of
quantifying NBOMes individually, and they are unable to detect NBOMes
simultaneously in complex samples as present in forensic scenarios.

Herein, for the first time, we report a potential high-performance
liquid chromatographic method using two detection systems: photodiode
array detection (HPLC-DAD) (detection system I) and amperometric detection
(HPLC-AD) utilizing commercially available impinging jet flow cell
incorporating SPEs (detection system II) for the simultaneous quantification
of four NBOMe derivatives (2a–d; Scheme 1). The proposed analytical
methodology was validated according to the International Conference
on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for the quantitative analysis of
the target analytes and demonstrated to be suitable for the routine
analysis of NBOMe derivatives in pure forms, in the presence of LSD,
and common adulterants typically found in street samples (e.g. paracetamol,
caffeine, and benzocaine), as well as within simulated blotter papers
offering excellent selectivity and specificity.

Results and Discussion
First, the cyclic voltammetric
profiles of each NBOMe derivative were explored using SPEs (electrode
size: 3.1 mm diameter) in a 0.04 M Britton–Robinson (B–R)
buffer at pH 7.0, which is the optimum pH previously reported by Andrade
et al. for the electrochemical characterization and quantification
of NBOMe derivatives.9Figure 1 depicts an overlay of the
cyclic voltammograms obtained for the four NBOMe derivatives, and,
as can be seen in the figure, each derivative develops two oxidation
peaks (peak I and peak II) at the following potentials (vs Ag/Ag/Cl): Ep1 ≈ +0.815 V and Ep2 ≈ +0.996 V for 25F-NBOMe (2a), Ep1 ≈ +0.817 V and Ep2 ≈ +1.027 V for 25C-NBOMe (2b), Ep1 ≈ +0.829 V and Ep2 ≈ +1.031 V for 25B-NBOMe (2c), and Ep1 ≈ +0.80 V and Ep2 ≈ +1.013 V for 25I-NBOMe (2d) (Table 2). Andrade et al.
have described the oxidation mechanism of these drugs occurring on
the SPE surface as follows (see Scheme 2):9 the first observed oxidation
peak (peak I) develops as a result of the oxidation of the secondary
amine present in the NBOMe structure into a primary amine, which will
be attached to the electrode surface, in addition to the generation
of an aldehyde. This process involves the removal of one electron
from the amino-nitrogen of the NBOMe secondary amine. The second oxidation
peak (peak II) occurs due to the replacement of the halogen atom in
the NBOMe compounds by a hydroxyl group, which afterwards produces
a ketone. The latter oxidation step happens via an electron transfer
from the highest-filled molecular orbital of organic halide to the
electrode, leading to the formation of cation radical [RX]+•; this is followed by the fission of a carbon–halogen bond
to form a carbocation, which will be attacked nucleophilically by
the hydroxyl group and its subsequent oxidation to a ketone (quinone).
Due to the overlap of the voltammetric signatures of the four NBOMe
derivatives, it is impossible to quantify each drug separately if
present together in a mixture by conventional electrochemical methods
when in a forensic scenario. Therefore, efforts were next directed
toward using high-performance liquid chromatography for the separation
of the target analytes, and quantification was carried out by comparing
the sensitivity of two detectors, which are photodiode array (detection
system I) and amperometric detectors (detection system II).

Optimization of the Experimental and Chromatographic
Conditions
Experimental Setup and Configuration of HPLC-AD System
Since the analytical quantification of NBOMe halide derivatives was
achieved herein by comparing two detection systems, namely, DAD and
AD, wherefore, the order of the detectors and the experimental setup
is important for the optimization of the proposed analytical method.
The most suitable arrangement of the two detectors was made following
Zuway et al. who used the same commercial impinging jet flow cell
for the HPLC amperometric detection of synthetic cathinones.42 They reported that the optimum experimental
setup can be accomplished by placing the flow-cell amperometric detection
system after the photodiode array detector and connecting them via
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) tubing (230 × 1.6 mm2, i.d. 0.3 mm, internal volume: 16.25 μL). This configuration
was proven to be better as it reduced the system back-pressure and
thereby decreased the flow-cell leakages observed when the amperometric
detector precedes the UV detector.42 In
addition, Zuway et al. reported using two flow cells of different
designs, which were the commercially available impinging jet flow
cell and custom-made iCell channel flow cell. In this work, only the
impinging jet flow cell was used, as Zuway et al. demonstrated that
iCell flow cell has reduced sensitivity as a result of its large internal
chamber volume used with the SPE, which increases the sample dispersion,
diluting the analytes, thus reducing the SPE’s sensor sensitivity
via mass transfer/diffusion to the electrode surface.42−45 Full optimization of all of the experimental parameters, affecting
the separation and quantitation of the analytes of interests, is described
in detail in the Supporting Information (SI) with the chromatographic conditions chosen for this study summarized
in Table 3.

After optimization of all

The order of elution of the drugs (from the chromatographic column)
depends on their degree of polarity, the more polar derivative, which
is the fluoride; 25F-NBOMe (2a) elutes first (tR = 3.83 ± 0.02 min) followed by the chloride;
25C-NBOMe (2b) (tR = 5.96
± 0.02 min) and then the bromide; 25B-NBOMe (2c)
(tR = 7.01 ± 0.03 min) and eventually
the iodide derivative; 25I-NBOMe (2d) elutes last (tR = 9.45 ± 0.05 min). The amperometric
peaks of the target analytes were slightly delayed by 0.39 s in comparison
with their corresponding peaks in the HPLC-DAD chromatogram; this
is due to the PTFE connection tubing between the HPLC-DAD and the
flow cell accommodating the SPE sensing platform. The retention times
of the analytes of interest within the amperogram were as follows:
25F-NBOMe (2a) (tR = 3.84
± 0.02 min), 25C-NBOMe (2b) (tR = 5.97 ± 0.02 min), 25B-NBOMe (2c) (tR = 7.02 ± 0.03 min), and 25I-NBOMe (2d) (tR = 9.46 ± 0.05 min).

Validation of the Proposed
Method
Validation of the
proposed method was performed in accordance with the International
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for the validation of
analytical procedures.46 The linearity
of the proposed HPLC-DAD (detection system I) and HPLC-AD (detection
system II) was evaluated by analyzing a series of different concentrations
of calibration standards (n = 6). Calibration curves
were constructed by plotting the average of peak areas (for detection
system I) or the average of peak heights (current, μA) (for
detection system II) for each concentration level of each investigated
drug against its corresponding concentration. The linear regression
equations were generated by the least-squares treatment of the calibration
data and are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Good linearity of the
tested analytical methodology is demonstrated by the high values of
coefficient of regression (r2), which
is ≥0.999, for detection system I, and ≥0.997, for detection
system II. When comparing the sensitivity of the two detectors, it
is apparent that detection system I is more sensitive than detection
system II. This can be confirmed by the higher slope (b) values of the calibration curves of the HPLC-DAD (b = 9.08–23.12) in contrast to those obtained by the HPLC-AD
system (b = 2.37 × 10–3–5.70
× 10–3). Furthermore, the sensitivity of the
accessible linear range of detection system I (10–300 μg
mL–1) slightly surpasses that of detection system
II (20–300 μg mL–1). However, this
difference in sensitivity is negligible in exchange for the advantage
of the amperometric detector being less expensive and more economic
than photodiode array detector. In both detection systems, HPLC-DAD
(detection system I) and HPLC-AD (detection system II), the limit
of detection (LOD) for each drug was determined using the following
formula: LOD= (3Sy/x)/b, where Sy/x is the standard
deviation of residuals and b is the slope of the
regression line of the calibration curve of each drug. The values
of LOD range from 4.56 to 6.65 and 9.65 to 17.98 μg mL–1, for detection system I and detection system II, respectively (Tables 4 and 5). These small values of LOD confirm the sensitivity of the
proposed method. However, by comparing the LOD of both detectors,
we concluded that HPLC-DAD (detection system I) is more sensitive
than HPLC-AD (detection system II). The repeatability (intraday precision)
of the developed methodology, utilizing both detectors, was assessed
by analyzing each concentration level six times (n = 6), within the same day, in the same laboratory, by the same analyst
using the same equipment. The percentage relative standard deviation
(RSD %) of the obtained results, for both detectors, was calculated
and is presented in Tables 4 and 5. The RSD % values were <2%,
indicating the good agreement between the individual test results
and confirming the precision of the proposed method. The system suitability
testing is used to evaluate the suitability of the chromatographic
system prior to using and is considered as an integral part of method
validation.47 All system suitability parameters
are listed in Tables 4 and 5, and it is evident from the tables
that all of the analytes fulfilled the ideal range of system suitability
parameters, proving the high-quality performance of the proposed chromatographic
system and ensuring confidence in the analytical method. Next, the
robustness of the proposed method was verified by introducing slight
changes in the method parameters such as column temperature (60 ±
2 °C), molarity of formate buffer (5.0 ± 2.0 mM), and pH
of buffer (7.0 ± 0.2 pH units). These variations did not have
any significant effect on the measured responses (peak area or peak
heights) as the calculated RSD % for the measured responses did not
exceed 2% in all of the cases (Tables S1 and S2). Furthermore, the retention time of all of the drugs and the total
run time were not affected when changing the aforementioned three
parameters (Table S1). The selectivity
of the proposed method was examined by testing the possibility of
interference of LSD with the determination of NBOMEs, as NBOMes are
commonly sold on blotter papers represented as LSD.22 As seen in Figure 3, the LSD did not interfere with any of the four NBOMe derivatives,
as it eluted early at the beginning of the chromatographic run with
retention times (tR) = 2.77 min in HPLC-DAD
(Figure 3A) and 2.78
min in HPLC-AD (Figure 3B). The resolution (Rs) between the LSD
peak and the next peak in the chromatogram (25F-NBOMe, 2a) is equivalent to 3.73, which proves the good selectivity and the
successfulness of the proposed protocol. Further selectivity and specificity
testing employing adulterants commonly found in street samples and
pharmaceutical excipients are found in the Supporting Information (SI).

Forensic
Application
Application of the Proposed Method to Simulated
Blotter Papers
Most recreated NBOMe blotter papers contain
higher doses of 500–800
μg per blotter,22,27 and the dimensions of the seized
blotters usually are in the range of [(0.5 × 0.5)–(1 ×
1) cm2].40,41 Therefore, three different simulated
blotter papers were laboratory-prepared (each blotter was prepared
in triplicate) using concentrations of 500 and 600 μg per blotter
of NBOMes, and LSD was added in two blotters to simulate real samples.
After the extraction of the drugs from the blotters with methanol,
the dilution of the samples was done to obtain concentrations within
the linearity ranges and then analyses were carried out; each blotter
was analyzed in triplicate. Depicted in Table 6, each drug eluted at its specified retention
time (tR) when utilizing detection systems
I and II, and the recovery% (R%) and error% (Er%) ranged from 99 to 101% and −1 to
(+)1%, respectively, emphasizing the high accuracy of the proposed
method. The good precision of the method was demonstrated by the low
RSD% values, which did not exceed 3%. Furthermore, the standard addition
procedure was applied and the calculated recoveries% ranged from 98
to 102 and 98 to 100% for detection systems I and II, respectively,
confirming the accuracy of the developed method (Table 7).

Conclusions
This work presents, for the first time, a simple rapid reliable
chromatographic method utilizing both photodiode array (detection
system I) and amperometric (detection system II) detectors for the
simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analyses of four NBOMe derivatives
(25F-, 25C-, 25B-, and 25I-NBOMe) (2a–d) in a single run. Both detection systems were reproducible and sensitive,
as the detection limits (LOD) reported herein are low enough for the
detection of the target analytes in confiscated blotter papers. Also,
the availability of instrumentation and the cost-effectiveness are
a noted advantage if compared with expensive mass detectors, as normal
UV detectors can be used in the case of detection system I because
quantification was done at a single wavelength (λmax = 205 nm), while detection system II employs commercially available
impinging jet flow cell incorporating SPEs, which are single shot
(disposable), mass-produced, and of economic prices. However, hyphenated
methodologies coupled to MS (e.g., LC–MS and GC–MS)
are indispensable tools that cannot be substituted with the developed
method for the analysis of seized blotters in forensic laboratories.
This is due to the fact that these blotters usually contain untargeted
compounds, which can be primarily screened and detected with mass
spectroscopy, while the presented methodology can be used as a final
conclusive confirmation of the presence of NBOMe in blotter papers.
The selectivity and the specificity of the proposed methodology were
tested by analyzing the studied drug mixture in the presence of LSD,
common adulterants found in street samples (i.e., caffeine, paracetamol,
and benzocaine), and pharmaceutical excipients, and none of them interfered
with the determination of the analytes of interest, demonstrating
the high selectivity of the method. Moreover, the proposed method
was successfully applied for the analysis of laboratory-prepared (simulated)
blotter papers, and the percentage recoveries obtained showed acceptable
levels of accuracy and precision, which can make this protocol the
one of choices for the routine analysis of the studied drugs in forensic
and quality control labs after prior screening by mass spectroscopy.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
All reagents (2C-F·HCl,
2C-C·HCl, 2C-B·HCl, 2C-I·HCl, 2-methoxybenzaldehyde,
triethylamine, and sodium borohydride) were of commercial quality
(Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, U.K., or Fluorochem Limited, Hadfield,
U.K.) and used without further purification. Lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD, 3) was obtained from LGC GmbH (Luckenwalde, Germany)
and used without any further purification. Solvents (Fisher Scientific,
Loughborough, U.K.) were dried, where necessary, using standard procedures.48 The target compounds (2a–d) were synthesized from their corresponding phenethylamine
hydrochlorides (1a–d), using an adaptation
of the method reported by Hansen et al.49 and obtained as stable (confirmed by 1H NMR and GC–MS),
off-white powders. The hydrochloride salts were determined to be soluble
(10 mg mL–1) in deionized water, methanol, and dimethyl
sulfoxide. To ensure authenticity of the materials utilized in this
study, the synthesized samples were structurally characterized (see
the Supporting Information) by high-field
NMR, FTIR, and GC–EI-MS. The purity of all samples was confirmed
by both NMR and GC–EI-MS (>99.5% in all cases). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (10 mg/600 μL in MeOH-d4) were acquired on a JEOL AS-400 (JEOL, Tokyo,
Japan) NMR spectrometer operating at a proton resonance frequency
of 400 MHz and referenced to the residual solvent peak (MeOH-d4: 1H NMR δ = 3.31 ppm, 13C NMR δ = 49.00 ppm50).
All samples were filtered prior to analysis. Infrared spectra were
obtained in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 using
a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10ATR-FTIR instrument (Thermo Scientific,
Rochester). GC–MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890B
GC and an MS5977B mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Wokingham,
U.K.). The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization
mode at 70 eV. Separation was achieved with a capillary column (HP5
MS, 30 mÅ, ∼0.25 mm, i.d. 0.25 μm) with helium as
the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL min–1. A 2 μL aliquot of the samples was injected with a split ratio
of 50:1. Both the injector and the GC interface temperatures were
maintained at 280 °C. Oven temperature program: 50 °C (hold
for 3 min) → 50–320 °C (30 °C min–1) → 320 °C (hold for 6 min). The MS source and quadrupole
temperatures were set at 230 and 150 °C, respectively. Mass spectra
were obtained in full-scan mode (50–550 amu). All samples were
prepared as 1 mg mL–1 solutions in methanol with
no derivatization and analyzed individually. Eicosane (1 mg mL–1) was used as an internal standard, and each sample
was injected six times.

All aqueous solutions were prepared
with Milli-Q deionized water of resistivity ≥18.2 Ω cm
(Millipore system). All solutions (unless stated otherwise) were vigorously
degassed, for 10 min, with highly pure nitrogen to remove oxygen prior
to analysis.

Instrumentation
High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography-Photodiode Array Detection
(HPLC-DAD) (Detection System I)
Reverse-phase HPLC was performed
with an Agilent HP series 1100 liquid chromatography instrument (Agilent
Technologies, Wokingham, U.K.). It consisted of an Agilent 1100 series
quaternary pump G1310A (serial DE80301064), which comprises a solvent
cabinet, an Agilent 1100 series vacuum degasser G1322A (serial JP73017007),
and an Agilent 1100 series photodiode array detector G1315A (serial
DE74603601), which was set at 205 nm. The LC system was equipped with
an Agilent 1100 series thermostated column compartment G1316A (serial
DE91810205) set to 60 °C and a 100-place autoinjector G1313A
(serial DE54901543), with an injection volume of 10.0 μL. The
analytical column used was an ACE C18-AR column (150 × 4.6 mm2 i.d., particle size: 5 μm), Hichrom Ltd., U.K. The
mobile phase consisted of 30:70% (v/v) of 5 mM ammonium formate and
100 mM potassium chloride buffer (pH 7.0): acetonitrile, flowing at
a rate of 2.5 mL min–1. The total run time was 10
min. The LC system was controlled by Agilent Chemstation (ver. 10.02)
software (Agilent Technologies, Wokingham, U.K.) for data analysis.

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Amperometric Detection
(HPLC-AD) (Detection System II)
The HPLC was coupled, in
sequence, to a flow cell obtained from Metrohm UK, Runcorn, U.K. (impinging
jet flow cell; product code: DRP-FLWCL-TEF-71306; 3.3 × 6.0 ×
3.3 cm3, flow chamber volume = 8 μL), housing the
SPE to give the HPLC-AD system. The connection between the DAD and
the flow cell was achieved via PTFE tubing (230 × 1.6 mm2, i.d. 0.3 mm, internal volume: 16.25 μL). The SPEs
utilized in this part of the study were fabricated in-house, as previously
described,42,51 and consisted of a 3.1 mm diameter
graphite working electrode, a graphite counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode. Amperometric measurements were carried out using
an EmStat 3 potentiostat/galvanostat (PalmSens BV, The Netherlands)
and controlled by PSTrace (version 4.4) software (PalmSens, The Netherlands).
All of the amperometric measurements were carried out using the following
parameters: (i) potential (E, +1.0 V); (ii) equilibration
time (tequibriation, 10.0 s); (iii) data
interval (tinterval, 0.08 s); (iv) current
range (100 nA to 1 mA); and (iv) total run time (trun, 5000 s). A new SPE was used for each experiment performed.
Buffer pH measurements were made using a “SevenCompact pH/Ion
S220” (Mettler-Toledo AG, Switzerland) pH meter.

Preparation
of the Mobile Phase [5 mM Ammonium Formate–100
mM Potassium Chloride Buffer (pH 7.0): Acetonitrile, 70:30% v/v]
The 5 mM ammonium formate–100 mM potassium chloride buffer
was prepared in a 2.0 L volumetric flask, by dissolving 0.6306 g of
ammonium formate and 14.91 g of potassium chloride into ultrapure
deionized water, and then the pH was adjusted to 7.0 (±0.02)
with 0.2 M NaOH. Afterwards, appropriate proportions of each of the
aqueous phase (1.4 L) and the organic modifier (0.6 L) were mixed
to obtain a 2.0 L mobile phase of the desired ratio. Finally, the
mobile phase was vacuum-filtered through a 0.45 mm pore filter paper.

Preparation of Standard Stock Solution and Calibration Curve
Working Solutions for HPLC
Each NBOMe derivative (10.0 mg, 2a–d) was weighted accurately into one
20.0 mL glass volumetric flask and diluted to volume with the mobile
phase to give a stock solution (S) containing 0.5 mg mL–1 of each drug. Working solutions for calibration standards were prepared
by further dilution of the latter solution (S) with the mobile phase
to obtain concentrations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 μg
mL–1 of each analyte. Working solutions were injected
directly into the HPLC, and the peak areas (for the HPLC-DAD analysis)
and peak heights (for the HPLC-AD analysis) of the target drugs were
plotted against their corresponding concentrations to construct the
calibration curves.

Selectivity Standards
Lysergic Acid Diethylamide
(LSD)
LSD (5.0 mg) was weighed
into a 10.0 mL glass volumetric flask and diluted to volume with the
mobile phase to get a stock solution of concentration 0.5 mg mL–1 of the drug. The latter solution (1.0 mL) was transferred
to a 5.0 mL volumetric flask, and the solution was made to the mark
with the mobile phase and injected into the HPLC to monitor the retention
time (tR) of LSD alone. Another 1.0 mL
of the LSD stock solution was transferred to a 5.0 mL volumetric flask
containing 1.0 mL of the NBOMe standard stock solution (S), and the
flask was made to the mark with the mobile phase and injected into
the HPLC to test the possibility of LSD interference with the determination
of the four NBOMe derivatives.

Forensic Application
Application
of the Method to Simulated Blotter Papers
Three blotter papers
(A4 white sheet blotters purchased from Amazon,
U.K.) were laboratory-prepared and analyzed using the proposed method
as follows: blotter papers were cut into pieces with dimensions 1
× 1 cm2; then, nine blotter papers were soaked into
three different vials (each three blotters were soaked into one vial),
and each vial contained 2.0 mL of the following solutions: vial 1
had 200 μg mL–1 LSD and 600 μg mL–1 25I-NBOMe (2d), vial 2 contained 100
μg mL–1 LSD, 500 μg mL–1 25I-NBOMe (2d), and 600 μg mL–1 25C-NBOMe (2b), and vial 3 had 500 μg mL–1 25B-NBOMe (2c). The blotter papers were
kept submerged into the solutions in the vials overnight; the next
day, the contents in the blotter papers were extracted by transferring
each blotter paper to an Eppendorf containing 1.0 mL methanol and
sonicated it in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. Finally, the obtained
solutions were diluted to half with the mobile phase to get concentrations
of the drugs within the linearity ranges and injected into the HPLC.
Standard addition solutions were prepared by a twofold dilution of
the latter sample solutions with the mobile phase and then spiking
them with known portions of 25I-NBOMe (2d) and/or 25C-NBOMe
(2b) and/or 25B-NBOMe (2c) standard solutions
to obtain total concentrations within the specified linearity ranges,
and then the solutions were injected into the HPLC.
