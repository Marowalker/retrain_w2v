In
the present work, we report, for the first time, a novel one-step
approach to prepare highly graphitized carbon (HGC) material by selectively
etching calcium from calcium carbide (CaC2) using a sulfur-based
thermo-chemical etching technique. Comprehensive analysis using X-ray
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms reveals a
highly graphitized mesoporous structure for the CaC2-derived
carbon with a specific surface area of 159.5 m2 g–1. Microscopic analysis displays micron-scale mesoporous frameworks
(4–20 μm) with a distinct layered structure along with
agglomerates of highly graphitized nanosheets (about 10 nm in thickness
and 1–10 μm lateral size). The as-prepared HGC is investigated
for the role of an anode material for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries.
We found that HGC exhibits good lithium storage performance in the
0.01–1.5 V range (reversible capacity of 272.4 mA h g–1 at 50 mA g–1 after 100 cycles and 214.2 mA h g–1 at 500 mA g–1 after 500 cycles),
whereas, when sodium is considered, we observed a drop in the overall
electrochemical performance owing to the high graphitization degree.
More importantly, the present study provides a perspective approach
to fabricate HGC via a simple, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic
route using CaC2 and sulfur as reactants.

Introduction
Designing and preparing
new carbon materials has long been of interest
in the field of materials science and engineering. Various carbon
materials with unique structures and morphology have been found to
be useful for a variety of applications owing to their outstanding
chemical and physical properties.1−3 Extracting metals or
metalloids from carbides using halogens, supercritical water, selective
oxidation, or vacuum decomposition has been demonstrated to be effective
for synthesizing a large family of carbon materials ranging from amorphous
carbon to graphite, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, and thus-obtained
carbon is termed as carbide-derived carbon (CDC).2,4 The
CDC structures have found numerous applications especially in lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors (SCs), gas storage, catalysis, biomedical
engineering, tribology, and as membranes.2 Particularly, porous CDC obtained by chlorination has been widely
studied for SC application because of the high specific surface area
and tunable pore size with a narrow size distribution.5−10 For example, Kou et al. prepared Mo2C-derived chlorine-doped
ordered mesoporous carbon with few-layered graphene walls and investigated
its performance as electrode material for SCs and LIBs.5 The Cl-doped porous CDC showed promising potential
for electrochemical energy storage (EES) with a high charge capacity
of 733 mA h g–1 at the current rate of 0.5 A g–1 after 100 cycles and a high specific capacitance
of 250 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 in 1
M H2SO4 solution. However, most of the available
reports on CDC exploit their potential in SCs owing to the high specific
surface area, whereas few studies are related to the use of CDC in
LIBs.2−4

Among various metal carbides, calcium carbide
(CaC2)
is a commercially available alkaline earth metal carbide with low
cost and serves as an ideal alkynyl source for synthesizing carbon
materials. Besides chlorine treatment of CaC2 to produce
CDC,11−13 various other methods have been proposed including
thermo-reaction of CaC2 using reactants like halogenated
hydrocarbon,14,15 oxalic acid,16 AlCl3·6H2O,17 CuCl2·2H2O,18 MgCl2,19 NaCl,20 and CO221 and electrochemistry technique through anodic oxidation of CaC2 dissolved in a LiCl–KCl–CaCl2 melt.22 The CaC2-derived carbon nano-onions18 and carbon nanosheets21 have also been studied for LIBs’ application, which displayed
a good cyclic performance with a reversible capacity of 391 mA h g–1 after 60 cycles at 37.2 mA g–1 and
a high capacity of 494 mA h g–1 after 200 cycles
at 100 mA g–1 as well as a good rate performance.
These investigations demonstrate the potential of CaC2-derived
graphitized carbon as anode candidates for rechargeable LIBs. In this
respect, we consider of significant importance developing new, efficient,
and low-cost techniques to fabricate carbon materials starting from
CaC2 as carbon source.

In this work we report, for
the first time, a new one-step approach
to prepare highly graphitized carbon (HGC) from CaC2 by
the thermo-reaction with sulfur at 550 °C. The structure and
morphology of the CaC2-derived HGC were characterized in
detail by various techniques, and the electrochemical performance
was investigated for application in LIBs and sodium-ion batteries
(SIBs).

Results and Discussion
The carbon formation achieved
by selectively etching calcium from
CaC2 using sulfur can be expressed as: CaC2 +
S = CaS + 2C. The Gibbs-free energy of the reaction at 550 °C
is ΔrGΘm = −374.5 kJ mol–1,
suggesting the occurring of a spontaneous reaction. Furthermore, the
enthalpy evaluation returns a strong negative value of ΔrHΘm = −433.2 kJ mol–1, implying that the reaction
of CaC2 with sulfur is thermodynamically advantageous.
Indeed, owing to this negative enthalpy value, the reaction will tend
to release heat which will facilitate the proper completion of the
reaction itself. At the end of the reaction the final carbon product
can be easily retrieved by removing the CaS byproduct through washing
with dilute hydrochloric acid and deionized water. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the resulting product is shown in Figure 1a. The sharp diffraction peak
around 2θ = 26.4° is attributable to the (002) reflection
of hexagonal graphite (JCPDS no. 41-1487), confirming the formation
of carbon with high graphitization degree. Calculated by the Bragg’s
law, the interplanar spacing of (002) reflection is 0.337 nm, similar
to graphite. The weak reflections at 42.3, 44.4, and 54.5° result
from the (100), (101), and (004) planes of hexagonal graphite, respectively,
whereas the two remaining diffraction peaks around 35° and 60°
are ascribed to contaminating SiC (JCPDS no. 49-1428). We speculate
that the presence of Si can be associated to impurity elements present
in the HGC product. These impurities could not be removed by acid
washing owing to their chemical bonding with HGC, as also confirmed
by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) result shown in Figure S2. We believe that SiC was probably formed
during the synthesis process of carbon from CaC2 at 550
°C. Similar XRD results have also been found for carbon materials
derived from CaC2 and polyhalogenated hydrocarbons by interfacial
mechanochemical reactions.15

(b) Raman spectrum, (c) high-resolution XPS spectrum
of C 1s, and (d) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
of the resulting product obtained by the reaction of CaC2 and sulfur at 550 °C for 5 h. The inset in (d) is the pore-size
distribution.

The structure of the
as-prepared carbon was identified by Raman
spectroscopy (Figure 1b). The peak at about 1380 cm–1 (D-band) is associated
with the defects and disordered structures of carbonaceous solids,
whereas the peak around 1600 cm–1 (G-band) is ascribed
to the stretching modes of the C–C bond of typical graphite.14−16 The intensity of the G-band (IG) is
much higher than that of the D-band (ID) with an IG/ID value of 3.2, suggesting that the as-prepared carbon is of high
graphitization degree,14,21 consistent with the XRD result.

The structure of the HGC was further investigated by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 1c). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s could be deconvoluted
into four peaks centered at 284.8, 285.5, 286.5, and 288.9 eV, attributed
to sp2-C, sp3-C, C–S, and C=O,
respectively.5,15,21−23 The predominant sp2-C peak is indicative
of the high graphitization degree of the carbon product. The presence
of the C–S peak demonstrates slight S-doping in the carbon.
The bonding information between carbon and sulfur is further revealed
in the high-resolution S 2p spectrum (Figure S1, Supporting Information), where the two peaks centered at 164.2
(S 2p3/2) and 165.4 eV (S 2p1/2) with an intensity
ratio of 2:1 and binding energy difference of 1.2 eV correspond to
spin-orbital splitting of thiophene-like sulfur incorporated into
graphite.24 The sulfur doping is preferential
in polarizing electron pairs, improving the graphitization degree
of carbon and introducing redox reactions owing to the large size
and high chemical activity.24 As evidenced
both theoretically and experimentally,24−26 heteroatom doping could
improve the electrical properties and chemical activity of carbon,
thus is favorable for energy storage capability.

In addition,
the specific surface area of HGC was evaluated by
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 1d). The product exhibits typical
IVa isotherms with an H3 type hysteresis loop at a relative pressure
of 0.4–1.0, indicative of the presence of meso- and macropores
in the carbon framework.27,28 The specific surface
area and pore volume are 159.5 m2 g–1 and 0.34 cm3 g–1, respectively. From
the pore-size distribution curve (the inset in Figure 1d), the mesopores are primarily 21 and 39
nm in size and the macropores are larger than 50 nm. These pores,
formed during the removal of CaS from the reaction product, are conducive
to improving the electrolyte permeability, increasing the electrode/electrolyte
contact interface and facilitating Li-ion transportation.29,30

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to examine the morphology
and microstructure of the HGC. From the FE-SEM image (Figure 2a), the product consists mainly
of three-dimensional (3D) fluffy carbon of about 4–20 μm
in size with an uneven surface, which is in fact composed of thin
carbon sheets with a lateral size of about 1–10 μm (Figure 2b). From the high-magnification
SEM image in the inset of Figure 2a, the carbon framework displays a layered structure
with plentiful mesopores. According to the EDX spectrum of HGC (Figure S2b), the carbon content accounts for
about 86.26 wt % (91.76% in atomic percent) and the S-doping content
is about 5.80 wt % (2.31% in atomic percent). The other elements of
O (7.05 wt %), Si (0.12 wt %), and Ca (0.77 wt %) stem from the strong
adsorption of CO2 and H2O on the porous HGC
and the impurities in CaC2. The element mappings for C
and S (Figure S2a) indicate the uniform
distribution of sulfur throughout the product, further confirming
the S-doping in the HGC. The TEM image of the carbon sheets and the
corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern are
shown in Figure 2c,
whereas the distinct diffraction rings in the inset confirm the high
graphitization of carbon. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image
of a single carbon sheet (Figure 2d), the planar spacing is about 0.34 nm, matching well
with graphite. Moreover, some disordered carbon could also be observed
on the surface of the graphitized nanosheet. As a consequence, the
HGC including 3D frameworks and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets reveals
long-range ordered rearrangement of carbon atoms occurring during
the selective thermo-chemical etching of CaC2 by sulfur.

of the HGC. The inset in (a) is the high-magnification SEM image of
the carbon framework, and that in inset in (c) is the corresponding
SAED pattern.

Starting from the aforementioned
electro-optical characterizations,
we argue that the obtained HGC characterized by high graphitization
degree, mesoporous structure, high surface area, and slight S-doping
might indeed be endowed with good electrochemical lithium storage
performance as the LIB anode. The assembled LIBs were charged and
discharged galvanostatically in the narrow voltage range of 0.01–1.5
V (vs Li+/Li) instead of the widely used 0.01–2.5
V or even 3 V as we were aiming for realistic applications. For the
first discharge profile (Figure S3), three
plateaus at about 1.7, 0.75, and 0.1 V can be observed, which are
due to the reaction of chemically bonded sulfur with Li+ to form Li2S,23,31,32 electrolyte decomposition with consequent formation of a solid electrolyte
interface (SEI) film on the surface of the active material,21,26 and the insertion of Li+ into graphitic layers,21,33 respectively. Upon the subsequent charge process, a plateau at around
0.1 and a sloped curve above 0.3 V are observed, delivering a charge
(reversible) capacity of 296.9 mA h g–1 at the current
density of 50 mA g–1 when the charge cut-off voltage
is set at 1.5 V. Meanwhile, a large initial irreversible capacity
loss could be observed, a common feature for carbon-based materials,
which can generally be assigned to the formation of an SEI layer.
It should be noted that the small amount of chemically bonded sulfur
provides a very limited contribution to the discharge plateau at 1.7
V of the initial discharge capacity, whereas no evident contribution
to the reversible capacity of the carbon material, as the delithiation
reaction of Li2S, occurs above 1.5 V. Cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) were also measured to provide enhanced information about the
charge/discharge processes, as shown in Figure S4. From the CV curve of the first scan, three reduction peaks
at about 1.7, 0.7, and 0.1 V can be seen in the cathodic scan, which
are in good agreement with the plateaus observed in the first discharge
profile (Figure S3). The wide peak at 0.7
V disappears after the initial scan, indicating the irreversible formation
of the SEI layer during the first cycle. The absence of a high-voltage
plateau at about 2.3–2.4 V, related to the multistep lithiation
process of elemental sulfur S8 in the initial discharge
process, together with the absence of the corresponding reduction
peak in the CV graph, further confirm that there is no residual S8 but chemically bonded sulfur in the carbon product. This
result was indeed in agreement with previous works reported in the
literature.23,31,32

It should be noticed that because of the choice of adopting
a narrow
voltage range with an upper cut-off voltage of 1.5 V, the reaction
during the first cycle between chemically bonded sulfur with Li+ determines a strongly irreversible reaction, which in turn
partially contributes to the cell capacity loss. After the first cycle
the capacity becomes stable, showing also a highly reversible process,
as evidenced by the overlapped CV curves shown in Figure S4 and charge/discharge profiles shown in Figure 3a. Even though the
reversible capacity of HGC as anode for LIBs is considerably lower
than those of previously reported carbon-based materials5,18,21,33 because of the narrow voltage range adopted in this work, the HGC
exhibits good cycling stability (Figure 3b). The initial Coulombic efficiency (CE)
is relatively low, 33.5%, in comparison to standard graphite anodes,
which can be attributed to the relatively large surface area of mesoporous
HGC as well as to the existence of disorders in the structures.21 The CE of the second cycle increases dramatically
to 87% and further to more than 95% after five cycles. After 100 cycles
at the current density of 50 mA g–1 the reversible
capacity of HGC is 273.5 mA h g–1 with a CE close
to 99.5%.

charge/discharge voltage profiles for the selected cycles at the current
density of 50 mA g–1, (b) cycling performance and
CE at 50 mA g–1, (c) rate performance at various
current densities, and (d) cycling performance and CE at the high
current density of 500 mA g–1. Cut-off potentials:
0.01 and 1.5 V.

In order to investigate
the possibility of applying HGC to high-power
LIBs, its rate performance was evaluated at elevated current densities
up to 1600 mA g–1. As shown in Figure 3c, the HGC displays an excellent
rate capability with reversible capacities of 276.6, 262.3, 236.6,
188, 158.5, and 137.8 mA h g–1 at 50, 100, 200,
400, 800, and 1600 mA g–1, respectively. Importantly,
when the current density was changed back to the initial 50 mA g–1, the corresponding capacity was recovered almost
entirely by settling to a value equal to 272.4 mA h g–1, very similar to the initial 276.6 mA h g–1. This
reversible capacity capability demonstrates that the HGC electrode
is characterized by a robust electrochemical structure resulting in
a good stability even after a high rate of cycling. Furthermore, a
500-cycle-long cycle analysis of HGC at the high current density of
500 mA g–1 was also conducted, as depicted in Figure 3d. The HGC showed
good cycling stability for over 500 cycles with a reversible capacity
of 214.2 mA h g–1. The average CE after the first
cycle was about 99.6%.

Besides the possibility of employing
HGC within LIBs, their effectiveness
was also tentatively investigated within sodium-storage systems as
the emerging SIB technology is known to carry the prominent advantage
of cost-effectiveness although at the expense of electrochemical performance.34 The galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles
are illustrated in Figure S5. Here, a long
discharge plateau at about 0.5 V (vs Na+/Na) is observed
in the first cycle owing to the decomposition of electrolyte on the
surface of the carbon material resulting in SEI film formation. The
initial reversible capacity is found to be 86.5 mA h g–1 at 50 mA g–1, much lower than that for LIBs. During
the subsequent cycles (Figure 4a), the HGC shows sloped charge/discharge voltage profiles
without visible plateaus with the reversible capacity becoming fairly
stable. Interestingly, a difference that can be found when comparing
the charge/discharge voltage profiles for LIBs and SIBs is that the
voltage plateaus below 0.2 V for LIBs are absent for SIBs, which could
explain the lower sodium storage capacity. The relatively low capacity
for sodium storage reflects that HGC is possibly not suitable for
SIBs because of the absence of stable Na–C binary compounds
and to the relatively large Na+ ion dimension that makes
Na+ ions difficult to be intercalated into graphite.34 Nevertheless, owing to the existence of numerous
pores and defects inside HGC, a stable reversible capacity around
81 mA h g–1 with CE close to 98% during cycling
at 50 mA g–1 could be delivered (Figure 4b).

Conclusions
In summary, a facile
and economical route to prepare HGC from low-cost
CaC2 at moderate temperature was developed. The CaC2-derived carbon is characterized by a high graphitization
degree and it mainly consists of 3D mesoporous frameworks and 2D nanosheets.
The synthesized HGC, once employed as anode material for rechargeable
LIBs, exhibits good lithium storage performance with reversible capacity
of 272.4 mA h g–1 at 50 mA g–1 after 100 cycles and 214.2 mA h g–1 at the high
current density of 500 mA g–1 after 500 cycles as
well as a good rate capability. Furthermore, the sodium-storage behavior
of HGC was also investigated, resulting in a limited electrochemical
performance because of the high graphitization degree. Finally, we
expect that the introduced approach to prepare carbon materials from
CaC2 could be especially exploited by the carbon industry
with also the consequence of possibly broadening the research and
development on other kinds of carbides.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of CaC2-Derived Carbon
In a
typical procedure, the raw materials of 3.2 g of chemically pure sublimated
sulfur (S8) and 6.4 g of industrial CaC2 powder
(corresponding to a molar ratio of 1:1) were mixed and put into a
stainless-steel autoclave of 30 mL capacity. As a reactor, the tightly
sealed autoclave was heated in an electric oven to 550 °C and
maintained for 5 h. When the autoclave was naturally cooled to ambient
temperature, the solid product in the autoclave was collected and
washed consecutively with dilute hydrochloric acid and deionized water
until all soluble materials were removed. After drying at 100 °C
for 12 h in an oven, black powder was ultimately obtained.

Material
Characterization
An XRD pattern was obtained
on a Rigaku Dmax-rc diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.1541 nm) at a scanning rate of 4° min–1. The morphology of the resulting carbon product was examined using
a Hitachi SU-70 field-emission scanning electron microscope with an
energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer and a JEOL JEM-2100 high-resolution
transmission electron microscope. A Raman spectrum was collected on
a Lab-RAM HR800 with excitation from an argon ion laser (632.81 nm).
XPS analysis was carried out on a KARTOS XSAM800 X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer, using Al Kα (hν = 1486.6
eV) radiation as the excitation source (V = 12 kV, I = 10 mA). The core-level energies were corrected with
the C 1s binding energy of 284.8 eV. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were acquired at −196 °C in a Quadrasorb SI
sorption analyzer with the samples being degassed at 300 °C for
3 h under a vacuum in the degas port. The specific surface area was
calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller model, and
the pore-size distribution was calculated in accordance with the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method.

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical properties
of the CaC2-derived carbon materials were investigated
using CR2025-type coin cells that were assembled in an argon-filled
glovebox. The working electrodes were prepared by coating the slurry
of the as-prepared carbon (80 wt %), carbon black (10 wt %), and polyvinylidene
fluoride (10 wt %) dissolved in n-methyl pyrrolidinone
onto a Cu foil substrate and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C
for 12 h. The mass loading of the active material was around 1.2 mg
cm–2 on each electrode. A lithium metal foil (sodium
metal used for SIBs) was used as a counter electrode while a glass
filter (Whatman) was used as a separator. The employed electrolyte
was a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl
carbonate (1:1 by volume) (for SIBs, 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene
carbonate and propylene carbonate −1:1 by volume). The cells
were galvanostatically discharged and charged at varied current densities
in the voltage range from 0.01 to 1.5 V (vs Li+/Li or Na+/Na) using a Biologic BCS-805 multichannel battery test instrument
at room temperature. CVs were also measured on the same instrument
at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in the same voltage
range.
