Halogen-free
flame-retardant polystyrene (PS) foams prepared by
supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) foaming have been
achieved. The flame-retardants include expandable graphite (EG) and
melamine phosphate (MP), and their influence on the foamability, decomposition
behavior, fire performance, and mechanical properties of PS foams
were investigated. It has been shown that flame retardants can generate
inert gases and catalyze the char formation from PS, and the formed
thick char layer with a notable barrier property can greatly decrease
the heat release of PS foams. The addition of triphenyl phosphate
(TPP) or hexaphenoxycyclotriphosphazene (HPCTP), which acts as a flame-retardant
plasticizer, can obviously improve the foamability and fire performance
of the foams. TPP or HPCTP can generate active phosphorous species
and phenoxyl radicals to enhance the gas phase flame-retardant effect;
therefore, the flame-retarded PS foams (with 25 wt % MP/EG) achieve
HF1 and V-0 ratings, with limiting oxygen index (LOI) values of 30.1
or 29.6%, respectively. The numerical assessment of synergistic effects
of TPP and HPCTP on further enhancing flame retardancy of PS foams
has been provided by the microcalorimeter (MCC) test. Further X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation on char residues of
PS foams demonstrates the formation of the P–O–C and
other stable structures.

1 Introduction
Polystyrene
(PS) foam has many advantages, such as lightweight,
heat insulation, shock absorption, noise reduction, and easy processing.1−3 Therefore, PS foam is widely used in various fields of national
economy, for instance, building, packaging and automobile.4−7 However, due to the chemical composition and structural features,
the PS foam is extremely flammable. Consequently, its limiting oxygen
index (LOI) is very low, only 18.0%.8 Meanwhile,
the combustion process is very rapid and will release a lot of heat
and toxic gases. A large number of serious building fire accidents
were caused by an external insulation of PS foams, resulting in huge
loss of people’s life and properties.9 It has been reported that the direct losses from fire was accounted
for 0.05–0.22% of GDP among industrialized nations.10 Usually, the halogen flame-retardant is with
high efficiency in reducing combustibility of PS foams, but it will
generate corrosive and toxic gases during the burning process.11,12 Government has gradually banned the use of halogen flame retardants;
therefore, it is of very important practical significance to develop
halogen-free flame-retardant PS foams with satisfactory properties.
Intumescent flame retardant, comprising an acid source, a gas source,
and a carbon source, is one of the important halogen-free candidates
to improve the flame-retardant property of PS foams, and best known
example of this is ammonium polyphosphate (APP) in combination with
a carbon source.11,13 During the combustion process,
intumescent flame retardants will form a foam-like carbonized layer
to reduce heat, oxygen, and fuel transfers.

Nowadays, the PS
foam is mainly prepared by the physical foaming
methods using hydrocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons as the blowing agents.
However, due to the environment and safety concerns,14 the replacement of conventional foaming agents is a fundamental
technological innovation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an ideal
physical blowing agent in the production of polymeric foams because
it is nonflammable, low cost, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly.15−17 In addition, the critical state (critical temperature: 31.1 °C;
critical pressure: 7.38 MPa) of CO2 is mild and easy to
achieve.18 To obtain polymeric foams, the
substrates absorb supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2)
to saturation state and then are followed by fast depressurization
at a constant temperature.19 Some research
has focused on the utilization of SC-CO2 to prepare flame-retardant
polymeric foams, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA),20 polypropylene (PP),21 and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile)
(SAN).22,23 It has been reported by Urbanczyk et al.22 that the SAN foams modified by (organo)clays/melamine
polyphosphate (MPP) were prepared by SC-CO2 foaming, and
a significant decrease in the heat release rate was observed owing
to the synergistic effect of the flame retardants. However, there
is a rare report dealing with the preparation of halogen-free flame-retardant
PS foams by SC-CO2 foaming.

In our previous work,24 we have proved
the synergistic effect between melamine phosphate (MP) and expandable
graphite (EG) on the flame-retardant PS. Based on this, a novel method
is adopted in the present work to prepare flame-retardant PS foams
with MP and EG by SC-CO2 foaming. The flame-retardant granulates
are obtained by melt extrusion, and the SC-CO2 saturated
granulates are used to prepare flame-retardant foams by hot-press
molding. To achieve a high expansion ratio and improve flame-retardant
property, we adopt triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and hexaphenoxycyclotriphosphazene
(HPCTP) to act as a flame-retardant plasticizer,25 which can decrease the viscosity of composite melt and
increase the chain segments movement ability. Through this method,
the commercial PS resin or waste PS foams can be used to produce flame
retardant PS foams, and we provide a new simple method to realize
the recycling or functionalization of waste PS foams. The impact of
MP/EG on the foamability of PS composites was evaluated by a rheology
test, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and cell morphology
analysis. The fire performance, heat release rate, and thermal oxidation
stability of the foams were systematically revealed by multiple test
methods. The formation of C–O–P in the char residue
was confirmed through an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test.
According to the results, the flame retardant mechanism combining
of gas phase and condensed phase is proposed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Flame Retardants
on Foaming Performance
The foaming performance of PS composites
is related to the viscosity
and glass transition temperature (Tg). Figure 1 shows the rheology
and DSC curves of PS composites. As the increasing of EG/MP content,
which can obstruct the movement of PS molecular chains, the viscosity
of PS composites shows a dramatic increase. The neat PS and flame-retardant
PS composites are with obvious shear thinning behavior. With the increase
of shear rate, the viscosity decreases gradually due to the orientation
of molecular chains and graphite flakes during the test.26 Adding MP/EG leads to the increase of viscosity,
but has little influence on the glass transition behavior, which happens
in the range of 100–120 °C. TPP and HPCTP can act as the
flame-retardant plasticizer, which can weaken the forces between polymer
chain segments and make the segments movement easier. When adding
3 wt % TPP or HPCTP, the Tg of 75PS composite
decrease from 105 °C to 96 or 100 °C, respectively. In addition,
the viscosity decreases clearly, especially for TPP3 composite, the
viscosity of which is much lower than the neat PS. For amorphous polymers,
the cell growth occurs above Tg, and the
melt is subjected to elongational deformation during the cell growth
step, which is impacted by the melt viscosity. The melt viscosity
will have an influence on the cell size, and the low viscosity will
promote cell growth, which will lead to the formation of larger cells.27,28 As for the cell stabilization, the morphology must be stabilized
and the cell growth has to cease, and the main factor is the increase
of melt viscosity that is caused by a reduction of the polymer’s
temperature. So, the Tg is a key parameter
for the cell stabilization because the polymer will behave like a
solid and the cell growth will stop by hardening of cell walls when
the temperature is below Tg. The decrease
of the viscosity and Tg will influence
the cell growth and cell stabilization steps of the foaming process
and will result in the decline of the foaming temperature.

Figure 1 (a) Rheology
and (b) DSC curves of different flame-retardant PS
composites.

The SEM images, expansion
ratio, and average cell size of flame-retardant
PS foams are presented in Figures 2 and 3. The 100PS foam with
a uniform cell size is obtained by SC-CO2 foaming, and
its average cell size, cell density, foam density, and expansion ratio
are 78.95 μm, 6.62 × 107 cells/cm3, 26.91 kg/m3, and 38.79 times, respectively. MP/EG can
reduce the absorption of CO2 and will lead to the heterogeneous
nucleation, so it will influence the foaming performance. The microvoids
between EG/MP and PS-melt can act as nucleation points, and gas will
diffuse to the microvoids,29 so the cell
will grow around EG/MP. The sheet filler EG leads to the collapse
or collision of cells in the PS matrix because the sharp edges and
harsh surface of EG will cause a cell rupture and hinder the cell
growth.30 Therefore, the sheet filler EG
contributes to the merging of cells, which results in forming of the
large size cells. The uneven dispersion and agglomeration of the flame
retardants happen with the increase of MP/EG content, which will further
deteriorate the foamability. The 25 wt % MP/EG addition results in
the increase of cell density and foam density and the decrease of
expansion ratio and average cell size.

and (e) MP/EG.

Figure 3 Average cell size and
expansion ratio of different flame-retardant
PS foams.

Although, it has been reported
that SC-CO2 has a plasticizing
effect to decrease the polymer melt viscosity,31 the effect is still not enough under a high flame-retardant
amount. Adding TPP or HPCTP decreases the viscosity and Tg, which is beneficial to the cell growth and will cause
the merging of cells. This is because a relative low melt viscosity
and the enhancement of viscous behaviors of TPP3 and HPCTP3 (Figure S1) are in favor of the diffusion of gas
through polymer melt, which will reduce the resistance of cell growth.32 In consequence, the cell density decreases slightly,
but the average cell size and expansion ratio increase clearly. Compared
to that of 75PS foam, the foam density decreases from 61.89 kg/m3 to 52.86 or 44.73 kg/m3, and the average cell
size increases from 39.73 μm to 53.31 or 46.55 μm, by
the addition of 3 wt % TPP or HPCTP. As a result, TPP and HPCTP can
act as a plasticizer to improve the foamability.

2.2 Thermal Oxidation Stability of Flame-Retardant
PS Foams
TGA as a valid approach to study the degradation
behaviors of materials was adopted to evaluate the thermal oxidation
stability of PS foams. Figure 4 presents the TGA and derivative thermos-gravimetric (DTG)
curves of flame-retardant PS foams and the detailed results are recorded
in Table 1. The neat
PS foam decomposes rapidly at 300–400 °C according to
the radical chain mechanism, and its initial decomposition temperature
(temperature at 5% weight loss, T5 wt %) and maximum decomposition rate are 315 °C and 23.14 wt %/min.
The thermal oxidation of PS generates styrene monomer, oligomers (dimer,
trimer, and tetramer), and products of oxidation (benzaldehyde, acetophenone,
phenol, styrene oxide, etc.),33−35 which can fuel the combustion
process.

The addition of MP/EG can increase
the initial decomposition temperature
of PS foams, which illustrate that the thermal oxidation stability
of foams is enhanced. However, the increments gradually decrease with
the increase of MP/EG amount, this is due to the lower initial decomposition
temperature of EG (190 °C, Figure S2) and MP (285 °C). The redox reaction between H2SO4 and the graphite of EG, which releases abundant blowing gases
(CO2, SO2, and H2O), leads to the
formation of the expanded graphite with a vermicular structure and
large volume.36,37 Meanwhile, high viscosity products
(such as polyphosphate compounds) are generated by the decomposition
of MP (Figure S2), which are helpful to
strengthen the bond between the expanded graphite to form a thick
barrier. At the early stage, the barrier can suppress the escape of
the volatiles, which leads to the weight loss delay and initial decomposition
temperature increase. Adding MP/EG enhances the char yield of the
foams at 700 °C, and the maximum weight loss rate of the foams
decrease as well. The escaping time of the volatile products are prolonged
by a char layer, which will cause the increase of free radicals life,
resulting in accelerating the thermal oxidation of PS. Compared with
100PS foam, the corresponding temperature of maximum mass loss rate
(Tmax) of flame-retardant foams are shifted
to the lower temperature. As for 75PS foam, the char residue at 700
°C and maximum weight loss rate are 14.80 wt % and 14.85 wt %/min,
respectively.

The char yield at 700 °C of TPP3 and HPCTP3
foams are 15.88
and 18.55 wt %. The addition of a small amount of HPCTP results in
the char residue increase, which will promote the formation of the
dense barrier to strengthen the condensed phase flame-retardant effect.
Compared with that of 100PS foam, the maximum mass loss rate of TPP3
and HPCTP3 foams are 14.65 and 14.70 wt %/min, which have a decline
of 36.69 and 36.47%, respectively. As a result, TPP and HPCTP can
act as the synergistic flame retardants to enhance the flame retardancy
of PS foams.

To further estimate whether there is an interaction
between PS
and flame retardants, the experimental and calculated TGA curves were
plotted in Figure 5. The initial decomposition temperature of 75PS, TPP3, and HPCTP
foams are shifted from 41, 48, and 76 °C to the higher temperature
than the calculated one, respectively. Meanwhile, the experimental
char yield is significantly higher than the calculated one. The char
yield at 700 °C of 75PS, TPP3, and HPCTP foams is 14.80, 15.88,
and 18.55 wt %, respectively. It is worth noting that 13.43 wt % (53.72
wt % × 25/100), 12.75 wt % (46.90 wt % × 28/103), and 13.80
wt % (50.77 wt % × 28/103) residues are from the flame retardants,
and the rest (1.37, 3.13, and 4.75 wt %) are from PS. Therefore, the
true residues from PS are 1.83, 4.30, and 6.52 wt %. Compared with
that of 100PS foam (0.27 wt %), the true residues from PS of 75PS,
TPP3, and HPCTP foams have about 6.78, 15.93, and 24.15 times increase.
The results indicate that adding flame retardants can promote PS to
participate in carbonization reaction and improve the thermal oxidation
stability of PS foams.

and HPCTP3

2.3 MCC and
Cone Calorimetric Analysis
Microcalorimeter (MCC) was utilized
to assess the fire performance
improvement of different flame-retardant PS foams, and the results
are presented in (Figure 6) and summarized in Table 2. The 100PS foam shows a very rapid heat release, with
a high peak heat release rate (Peak-HRR) and total heat release (THR)
values of 929 W/g and 37.8 kJ/g, respectively. As for flame-retardant
foams, the Peak-HRR and THR values decrease clearly with the increasing
of flame-retardants amount. Adding a small amount of TPP or HPCTP
can further reduce Peak-HRR and THR values. Compared with 100PS foam,
the Peak-HRR and THR values of HPCTP3 foams decrease to 496 W/g and
27.9 kJ/g , which have a reduction by 46.6 and 26.2%, respectively.
Heat release capacity (HRC) is an important assessment parameter to
the fire safety of polymer foams,38 the
HRC value of HPCTP3 foam reduces from 962 to 511 J/g·k, with
a decrease by 46.9%.

a Flame retardant
effectivity (EFF)
and synergistic effectivity (SE) were calculated by MCC data as follows:
EFF = (Peak-HRRpolymer – Peak-HRRcomposite)/Flame-retardant content; SE = EFFFlame-retardant + synergists/EFFFlame-retardant.

To provide a numerical assessment of synergistic effects
of TPP
and HPCTP, the flame retardant effectivity (EFF) and synergistic effectivity
(SE), as shown in Table 2, of flame-retarded PS foams were calculated. As defined by Lewin,39−41 the EFF values and SE values of PS foams are calculated by the reduction
of Peak-HRR, which are obtained from MCC results. With the increase
of the flame-retardants amount, the EFF value decreases gradually,
which illustrates that the contribution of a unit mass of flame retardants
to the flame retardant efficiency decreases gently. Adding 3 wt %
TPP or HPCTP, the EFF values of foam increase (17.15 and 17.82, respectively).
The SE values of TPP3 and HPCTP3 foams are 1.16 and 1.21, respectively,
indicating that TPP and HPCTP can act as the synergists to further
enhance the flame retardancy of PS foams.

Figure 6 HRR curves of different
flame-retardant PS foams from the MCC test.

The cone calorimeter test, which is able to effectively assess
burning behaviors of polymeric materials in actual fire accidents,42,43 was adopted to evaluate the fire safety of PS foams as well. Figure 7 presents the HRR,
THR, fire growth rate index (FIGRA), weight loss, and smoke production
rate (SPR) curves of 100PS and flame-retarded PS foams, and the detailed
data are shown in Table 3. The ignition times of flame-retarded PS foams are shorter than
that of 100PS foam. During the heating process, the rapid melting
of 100PS foam results in the increase of the distance between the
heated surface and heater, so that the heating efficiency is reduced.
Meanwhile, adding flame retardants increases both of the viscosity
and thermal conductivity of flame-retarded foams, which will cause
the fast rise of surface temperature to decomposition temperature.44 As a result, flame-retarded PS foams are ignited
in a shorter time. After ignition, 100PS foam releases abundant heat
within 100 s. For 75PS and
TPP3 foams, the slightly higher THR values is due to their higher
foam density. All flame-retarded PS foams show typical HRR curves
of the char-forming substance and are with lower HRR values. It is
noteworthy that the obvious reduction of Average-HRR and Peak-HRR
values are considered as the most significant element in reducing
fire loss. The Peak-HRR, Average-HRR, and THR values of HPCTP3 foam
are 169 kW/m2, 74 kW/m2, and 18.63 MJ/m2, which decrease by 56.92, 43.51, and 23.24%, respectively,
compared to those of 100PS foam. Adding a small amount of HPCTP, which
presents a good synergistic effect both on enhancing foaming and fire
retardant properties, can further decrease the heat release of the
foams. The prolonged burning time and reduced HRR values are induced
by the thick char layer, which can suppress the escape of the combustible
volatiles. The FIGRA, which is calculated by the ratio of HRR on time
(HRRi/ti), is very useful to
evaluate the contribution of a material to fire.45 The FIGRA curves of flame-retarded PS foams are lower than
100PS foam, which shows that adding flame retardants can decrease
the dedication of PS foams to a fire. Compared to that of 100PS foam,
the maximum FIGRA value of HPCTP3 foam decreases from 5.63 to 4.12
kW/m2/s. Meanwhile, the decrease of the MAHRE (maximum
average rate of heat emission) value also indicates the fire performance
improvement of the flame-retarded foams.

In Figure 7d, the
weight loss rate of flame-retarded PS foams are much lower than 100PS
foam, and flame-retarded PS foams are of higher mass retention. The
peak mass loss rate (Peak-MLR) and Average-MLR of HPCTP3 foam reduce
from 0.18 and 0.09 g/s to 0.07 and 0.02 g/s, with a reduction by 61.11
and 77.78%, respectively. This result indicates that the formed thick
char layer can cut off the fuel supply to the combustion process,
which will cause the flame to self-extinguish. During the combustion
process, PS foam will generate a large volume of toxic smoke, resulting
in the death by suffocation or inhalation.46 The Peak-SPR and total smoke production (TSP) of HPCTP3 foam are
0.08 m2/s and 6.61 m2/kg, which decrease by
50.00 and 30.64% in comparison to 100PS foam, respectively. The CO
and CO2 production rates of flame-retarded PS foams are
lower than that of 100PS foam. The slowly release of toxic smoke creates
the conditions for the safety evacuation of personnels. It is worth
noting that adding flame retardants increase the CO yield (defined
as the mass of CO formed from the unit mass of burning materials).
It is known that the CO production results from incomplete combustion.
The active phosphorous species generated by the decomposition of the
flame retardants can act as radical scavengers and cause the incomplete
combustion, thus correspondingly more CO is produced under forced
flaming conditions. In other words, the flame retardants are with
a flame retardant effect in the gas phase.47

Figure 8 presents
the residues of 100PS and HPCTP3 foams after cone calorimetric test.
The 100PS foam has almost no residue left after the test, but HPCTP3
foam has about 21 wt % char residue retention. In the heating process,
EG forms the worm-like expanded graphite, and MP decomposes to form
high-viscosity phosphate-containing compounds, which can strengthen
the bond between the expanded graphite. The formed thick char residue
possesses an obvious barrier effect, which can suppress the exchange
of heat, air, and volatile products. The flame retardancy of PS foams
is greatly improved due to the condensed phase flame retardant effect.

test.

2.4 Flame
Retardant Mechanism of PS Foams
As shown in Figure 9, the chemical composition
of the char residue for 75PS, TPP3, and
HPCTP3 foams were characterized by XPS analysis. The results show
that the C content is very high indicating that the expanded graphite
is enriched on the surface of the residues and can play a role as
barrier. Take HPCTP3 foam as an example to illustrate the detailed
information of C1s, O1s, P2p and
N1s spectra. The peaks at 284.650, 286. 087, and 288. 650
eV are assigned to C–H and C–C in aliphatic or aromatic
species, C–O–P in phosphate compounds, and C=O
in carbonyl compounds, respectively. The peaks of O1s spectra
with a binding energy around 531.819 and 533.104 eV are the contributions
of =O in phosphate or carbonyl groups and −O–
in C–O–P or C–O–C groups.48−50 The peak at 134.306 eV corresponds to P–O–C or PO3– groups in phosphate species.51 For N1s spectra, the peak at 399.740
is attributed to nitrogen in pyrrole- or pyridine-type structures.48,49 The binding energy around 401.530 eV is corresponding to the quaternary
nitrogen and the formation of oxidized nitrogen compounds.52 The formation of the stable structures (such
as C–O–P) is beneficial to the retention of more char
residues at a high temperature.

Figure 9 XPS spectra of the heat-treated (a) 75PS,
(b) TPP3, and (c) HPCTP3
systems.

Figure 10 shows
the flame retardant mechanism of PS foams. Under the heating condition,
EG will come into forming a worm-like expanded graphite by the redox
reaction (>190 °C) between H2SO4 and
graphite.
MP will undergo a series of complex reactions (including condensation,
chain scission, and crosslinking) during the decomposition process,
and will decompose into various intermediates, such as melamine pyrophosphate,
melamine polyphosphate, melam ultraphosphate, water, ammonia, and
melamine.53 The high-viscosity phosphate-containing
products cover the surface of worm-like expanded graphite, which can
prevent the oxidation of expanded graphite. Therefore, the thick char
layer with excellent barrier effect is formed. The inert gases (SO2, CO2, H2O, NH3, etc.) generated
by EG and MP can dilute the concentration of the fuels and oxygen.
Furthermore, TPP and HPCTP can act as the synergists to improve the
flame retardancy. The decomposition of TPP and HPCTP will generate
active phosphorous species (such as PO·, P·, and PO2·) and phenoxyl radicals,54,55 which can quench down the flammable free radicals (such as H· and OH·) and inhibit the combustion
process. Due to both of gas phase and condensed phase flame retardant
effect, the flame retardancy of PS foams is improved obviously.

Figure 10 Flame retardant
mechanism of PS foam.

2.5 Flammability of Flame-Retardant PS Foams
The LOI test, vertical burning test, and horizontal burning test
were adopted to evaluate the flammability of PS foams, as presented
in Table 4. The 100PS
foam quickly burns up to the holding clamp and produces an abundant
black smoke, with a low LOI value of 18.4%. Increasing the MP/EG content,
the flame retardancy of PS foams improves gradually by the formation
of the thick char layer. Adding 25 wt % MP/EG, the LOI value of 75PS
foam increases to 26.3% but can only reach HBF and V-1 ratings. Further
increase of the MP/EG content will enhance the flame retardancy of
PS foams but will deteriorate the foaming performance. TPP and HPCTP,
which can act as the flame-retardant plasticizer, were added to enhance
both of the foamability and fire performance of PS foams. The LOI
values of TPP3 and HPCTP3 foams are 30.1 and 29.6%, respectively,
and both can achieve HF1 and V-0 ratings.

2.6 Thermal Conductivity and
Mechanical Properties
of PS Foams
Figure 11 presents thermal conductivity of different flame-retardant
PS foams. The thermal conductivity of flame-retarded PS foams increase
with the increase of MP/EG amount. There are two main reasons for
this phenomenon: first, the foam density increases significantly with
the MP/EG content increasing; second, part of the EG particles, which
are of higher thermal conductivity than PS, form the heat conduction
path. The thermal conductivity of 75PS foam is 0.0435 W/(m·k).
After the introduction of TPP or HPCTP into PS composites, the improvement
of the foaming performance leads to the decrease of the foam density.
Therefore, the thermal conductivity of TPP3 and HPCTP3 foams decreases
to 0.0372 and 0.0363 W/(m·k).

Figure 11 Thermal conductivity of different flame-retardant
PS foams.

The bending strength and compressive
strength of 100PS, 75PS, TPP3,
and HPCTP3 foams were investigated, as shown in Figure 12. The bending strength and
compressive strength of 75PS foam are higher than that of 100PS foam
because of the increase of the foam density and the decrease of the
cell size. However, adding TPP or HPCTP causes the reduction in the
foam density of TPP3 and HPCTP3 foams. The continuity and stability
of the cell structure deteriorate as well, due to the formation of
the large cells induced by EG. Compared with 75PS foam, the bending
strength of TPP3 and HPCTP3 foams reduce to 0.660 and 0.560 MPa and
the compressive strength of those decrease to 0.180 and 0.178 MPa,
respectively.

and HPCTP3.

3 Conclusions
Synergistic effects of flame retardants on the foamability and
fire performance of PS foams prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide
foaming are observed. The results show that the MP/EG content will
increase the melt viscosity of PS composites and deteriorate the foaming
performance. The addition of TPP or HPCTP decreases the melt viscosity
and glass transition temperature of PS composites and improves the
foaming performance. Meanwhile, adding another 3 wt % TPP or HPCTP
further enhances the flame retardant performance of 75PS foam (with
25 wt % MP/EG addition), achieving HF1 and V-0 ratings, with LOI values
of 30.1 or 29.6%, respectively. The formation of the stable structures
(such as C–O–P) are beneficial to retain more char residues
at a high temperature, which can play a role in suppressing the exchange
of heat, air, and volatile products. The inert gases (H2O, NH3, etc.), active phosphorous species (such as PO·, P·, and PO2·), and phenoxyl radicals generated by the decomposition of the flame
retardants are helpful to suppress the combustion process. Due to
both of gas phase and condensed phase flame-retardant effect, the
heat release rate, total heat release, and smoke production rate of
the foams decrease significantly, which create the conditions for
the safety evacuation of personnels. The thermal conductivity, bending
strength, and compressive strength of HPCTP3 foam are 0.0363 W/(m·k),
0.560 MPa, and 0.178 MPa, respectively.

4.2 Preparation
of Flame Retardant PS Foams
Figure 13 reveals
the preparation process of flame retardant PS foams, and the formulation
of different foams are summarized in Table 5. PS and flame retardants were premixed and
then extruded by a TSSJ-25/33 corotating twin-screw extruder (Φ
= 25 mm, L/D = 33, Chenguang Research Institute of Chemical Industry,
China) with an extrusion temperature of 180 °C and a rotation
speed of 150 rpm. The dried extruded pellets were saturated with SC-CO2 in a stainless steel autoclave (Beijing Century Senlang Experimental
Apparatus Co., Ltd., China) at a temperature of 45 °C and a pressure
of 12 MPa for 4 h. The saturated PS granulates were used to prepare
foams by hot-press molding (YJ63 × 2 Plate Vulcanizing Press
Machine, Chengdu Rich Chuanghong Technology Co., Ltd., China) at corresponding
foaming temperature under 20 MPa. After 15 min, the flame-retardant
foams were obtained by rapid pressure drop.

4.3 Characterization
The rheology test
was carried out on a 25 mm parallel-plate rotational rheometer (AR2000ex,
TA instruments, USA) using a 1.8 mm gap. The dynamic frequency sweeps
of different flame retardant PS composites were carried out in a frequency
range from 100 to 0.01 Hz using 5% strain at 180 °C.

The
DSC test was performed on a Q20 DSC analyzer (TA instruments, USA)
under a nitrogen environment in an aluminum pan. The flow rate is
50 mL/min, and the heating rate is 10 °C /min. The glass transition
temperature was calculated from 40 to 180 °C.

The morphology
of PS foams was observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (FEI Instrument Co., Ltd., Netherlands) after gold sputter-coating.

The horizontal and vertical burning tests were performed on an
HK-HVR horizontal and vertical flame tester (Zhuhai Huake Testing
Equipment Co., Ltd., China) according to UL-94, ASTM D4986, and ASTM
D3801, with sample dimensions of 150 × 50 × 13 mm3 and 127 × 12.7 × 13 mm3.

The LOI value
was measured by a JF-3 oxygen index instrument (Nanjing
Jiangning Analysis Instrument Company, China) with 130 × 10 ×
10 mm3 samples according to ASTM D2863.

The TGA test
was carried on a TA-Q50 instrument (TA instruments,
USA) from room temperature to 700 °C under an air atmosphere.
The heating rate is 10 °C/min, and the gas flow rate is 60 mL/min.

The MCC test was carried out at a FAA-PCFC microcalorimeter (Fire
Testing Technology Limited, UK). The sample (about 4 mg) was heated
to 750 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/s under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The combustor was set to 900 °C with an oxygen/nitrogen flow
rate of 20/80 mL/mL.

The combustion behaviors were investigated
by cone calorimeter
(Fire Testing Technology Limited, UK). The samples with 100 ×
100 × 15 mm3 were exposed to a radiant heat flux of
35 kW/m2 according to ISO 5660.

XPS spectra of the
char residue obtained at 700 °C were recorded
by Shimadzu/Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD Multifunctional X-ray Photoelectron
Spectrometer (Manchester, UK).

Bending strength and compressive
strength of different PS foams
were tested by INSTRON 5567 tensile and compression tester (Instron
Corporation, USA). The bending strength was completed according to
ISO 1209-1:2004 with a testing speed of 10 mm/min with a sample size
of 120 × 25 × 20 mm3. For the compressive strength
test, samples were measured at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min with
dimensions of 50 × 50 × 30 mm3 according to ISO
844:2007. At least five samples were used to calculate the average
values. Thermal conductivity of the foams was obtained by a hot disk
thermal analyzer (Hot Disk AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
