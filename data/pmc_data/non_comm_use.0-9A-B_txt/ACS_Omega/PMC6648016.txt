With the increasing consumption of
natural resources, photocatalysis
converting solar energy to chemical energy has attracted extensive
attention of researchers owing to the advantages of developing energy-saving
and environmentally benign processes. In this work, a facile and simple
method was developed to synthesize a metal-free organic optoelectronic
molecule (denoted as DPPRD), which is composed of a central diketopyrrolopyrrole
moiety and two terminal units of a rhodanine (RD) moiety. This is
a first green strategy toward the synthesis of DPPRD. Because of good
thermal stability, narrow band gap, and excellent visible light absorption
of solar spectrum, DPPRD exhibited to be an efficient and chemically
stable photocatalyst for visible light degradation of organic pollutants
such as bisphenol A (BPA) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution.
The control experiments with different types of radical scavengers
implied that the hole (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) were the key reactive species during the photodegradation
processes. The photodegradation pathways of BPA and MO were thus proposed
based on the identified intermediates. This improved method for DPPRD
synthesis is expected to widen its applications to industrial production,
whereas its excellent visible light photocatalytic activity would
be utilized potentially in the field of environmental and industrial
applications.

1 Introduction
Photocatalysis,
a promising technique especially using visible
light as an energy source, has gained considerable attention for the
environmental remediation because of the advantages of developing
energy-saving and environmentally benign processes.1−3 Traditional
inorganic semiconductors such as TiO2,4,5 ZnO,6 and SnO27,8 exhibit excellent
ultraviolet light response, and thus, they are known as efficient
UV-sensitive photocatalysts widely used in the degradation of organic
pollutants through the surface oxidation reactions caused by photoinduced
positive holes and negative electrons.9 Considering the fact that the ultraviolet light accounts for only
5% of sunlight,10 quite limited solar energy
is absorbed by conventional inorganic semiconductors, which retards
their practical applications. Therefore, various physical and/or chemical
methods including doping,11 dye sensitization,12 and π-conjugated molecule coupling13 have been developed to improve the visible light-responsive
photocatalytic activity of inorganic semiconductors.14−18 It is still a challenging subject to develop heterogeneous photocatalysts
with promising visible light photocatalytic activity.

Compared
with traditional inorganic semiconductors, the photoactive
organic materials with novel chemical structures, flexibility in molecular
design, and low cost provide numerous opportunities to tailor the
physicochemical properties through the configuration modification
with useful organic functional groups. Among photoactive organic materials
family, metal-free organic semiconductors have attracted remarkable
attention because of their advantages of unique electron delocalization,
flexibility, and proper optoelectronic properties.19,20 In particular, most of the π-conjugated organic molecules
exhibited excellent visible light absorption and electron-transfer
character21,22 because the intramolecular charge-transfer
(ICT) effects were helpful to tune the energy levels and optical band
gap. Diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) are a star-conjugated acceptor system
which possesses favorable properties of strong light absorption and
high photochemical stability.23,24 Chen et al. reported
that introducing the 3-ethylrhodanine (RD) units in the terminal position
of DPP could improve solar light absorption.25 Very recently, an ambipolar optoelectronic molecule, containing
the strong electron-withdrawing units of DPP and 3-ethylrhodanine
(RD), has been designed and explored in the organic solar cells.26−28 However, there are few examples of using π-conjugated organic
semiconducting molecules as photocatalysts for the degradation of
organic pollutants under visible light irradiation. Recently, the
composited organic photocatalyst obtained through π–π
interactions of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane and perylene tetracarboxylic
diimide was reported to show high efficiency for the visible light-irradiated
degradation of phenol.29 From the viewpoint
of practical application, developing ideal photocatalysts needs to
consider several key features, such as easy synthesis and separation,
high visible light photocatalytic activity and stability, good reusability,
and possibility of designing environmentally benign continuous flow
processes.

In this work, a facile and simple method was developed
for the
synthesis of a metal-free organic optoelectronic molecule (denoted
as DPPRD) consisting of a central DPP moiety and two terminal units
of a rhodanine (RD) moiety (Figure 1). DPPRD was applied to the photocatalytic degradation
of bisphenol A (BPA) and methyl orange (MO) dye under visible light
irradiation. Under optimized conditions, DPPRD provided the degradation
rates of 99 and 95% for BPA and MO, respectively. In cycling experiments,
DPPRD showed reusable performance for the degradation of organic pollutants.
The intermediates and reactive species of the photodegradation of
BPA and MO have been investigated, allowing us to propose possible
mechanisms.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of DPPRD.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of DPPRD
A simple and green
method was developed for the synthesis of DPPRD as shown in Scheme 1. The target molecule
DPPRD was very conveniently achieved through the reaction of DPP-based
dialdehyde compound (1) with two 3-ethylrhodanine pigments
in the mixture solution of dichloromethane and triethylamine at room
temperature under atmospheric pressure. The purified product was achieved
by recrystallization at 80% yield. This is a first green strategy
toward the synthesis of DPPRD. Compared with previous reported literature,26−28 the improved synthetic method shows the following
advantages: an hypotoxic solvent of dichloromethane replacing hazardous
and carcinogenic solvents of chloroform and piperidine and no need
of heating/reflux and nitrogen/argon protection during the reaction
process. According to the mild synthesis conditions described above,
this improved synthetic method with environmentally friendly features
has potential to the practical application in industrial production
because it is expected to reduce energy consumption and simplify the
operation process.

2.2 Thermal Property, Optical Absorption, and
Frontier Orbitals
As shown in Figure S4 (see the Supporting Information), the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) curve showed that only 5% weight loss (Td) of DPPRD was observed when the temperature was raised
up to 355 °C, implying that the DPPRD molecules have high thermal
stability. The UV–vis spectra of DPPRD either in the solid
state or in the organic solvent are shown in Figure 2. When diluted in chloroform solution, the
spectrum of DPPRD was featured by two strong absorption bands at 649
and 702 nm, which are located in the 400–760 nm wavelength
region of solar light. This indicated that multiple dyes could increase
the photoresponse by introducing conjugated building blocks.28 The maximum absorption band of DPPRD solution
located at 702 nm had a coefficient efficiency of 8.3 × 104 L M–1 cm–1, which was
attributed to π-electron delocalization and ICT effect between
the DPP and RD moieties in DPPRD molecules. The absorption band around
400 nm could be attributed to the π–π* transitions
between substituted moieties and their conjugated skeletons.30 Compared with DPPRD in chloroform solution,
the diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectrum of DPPRD in the solid
state displayed a broader and red-shifted absorption spectrum in the
range of 400–850 nm, suggesting that the molecules formed aggregates
in the solid state. The optical band gap of DPPRD was extrapolated
from the diffuse reflectance edge following the Tauc equation.31 As shown in Figure S5, the band gap of 1.39 eV suggested that DPPRD exhibited excellent
visible absorption properties. The frontier orbitals of DPPRD were
measured by cyclic voltammetry (Figure S6), and the values of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are summarized
in Table 1.

2.3 Photocatalytic Performance of DPPRD
The photocatalytic activity of DPPRD has been investigated for the
first time in the photodegradation of organic pollutants under visible
light irradiation. BPA and MO were selected as the representative
pollutants. This would provide a new photocatalyst system for the
visible light photodegradation of organic pollutants.

2.3.1 Effect of Initial pH
The pH value
usually influences greatly the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts
during the photodegradation process.32 Therefore,
the effect of the pH of BPA solution was first investigated. Figure 3a displays the time-dependent
photodegradation of BPA solution (0.04 mmol L–1)
with different initial pH values. After 120 min of visible light irradiation,
the degradation rate of the BPA aqueous solution was about 85, 99,
70, and 55% at pH 2, 5, 9, and 11, respectively. It is obvious that
BPA in acidic solutions was more easily photodegraded than in alkaline
solutions because the alkaline media may make a part of H2O2 easily decompose into H2O and O2 rather than the generation of the hydroxyl radicals •OH.33 The above results are in agreement
with the literature data that weakly acidic media are beneficial for
the photodegradation of BPA.34 However,
in acidic media, the degradation rate of BPA decreased from 99 to
85% when the pH value decreased from 5 to 2, indicating that the lower
pH value of the reaction solution was less favorable for BPA photodegrdation.
It may be that the generated hydroxyl radicals •OH were unstable and they may interact with each other to form H2O2 in lower pH reaction solution. On the basis
of the above experimental results, the optimum pH value was 5; hence,
the following photodegradation reactions were carried out under this
pH value.

(c) initial BPA concentration on the DPPRD-catalyzed photodegradation,
and (d) first-order kinetic curves of BPA degradation under visible
light irradiation.

2.3.2 Effect
of Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration
As a common and green
oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is
directly added into the photodegradation
system to act as an electron acceptor generating the hydroxyl radicals •OH under irradiation.35 The •OH radicals not only greatly accelerate the photocatalytic
activity but also eliminate the colored intermediates formed during
the reaction processes.36 Accordingly,
the effect of H2O2 concentration on the initial
photonic efficiency has been studied and discussed. As shown in Figure 3b, the photodegradation
of BPA was investigated at different H2O2 concentrations.
The photodegradation occurred effectively in the presence of both
H2O2 and photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.
After irradiation for 120 min, BPA was photodegraded 75, 82, and 99%
in the presence of 4.9, 9.8, and 19.6 mmol L–1 of
H2O2, respectively. This can be ascribed to
the fact that the •OH in the photocatalytic system
increased with increasing initial H2O2 concentration
from 4.9 to 19.6 mmol L–1. However, when the concentration
of H2O2 further increased from 19.6 to 39.2
mmol L–1, the photodegradation rate of BPA decreased
from 99% to about 87%. This is possibly because an excess amount of
H2O2 may become the scavenger to extinguish
the •OH radicals and that some •OH radicals would recombine to form H2O, leading to the
decreased oxidizing ability during the degradation process.37 These detailed reaction steps will be discussed
later. Moreover, the H2O2 molecules also competed
with the BPA molecules for adsorption and diffusion at catalytic active
sites at higher concentrations of H2O2, which
could result in relatively lower degradation rates. From the above
results, the optimal H2O2 concentration of 19.6
mmol L–1 was selected for the following photodegradation
of BPA.

2.3.3 Effect of Initial BPA Solution Concentration
Figure 3c shows
the effect of the initial concentration on the photodegradation of
BPA. The correlation between initial concentration BPA and its photodegradation
rate was fitted with pseudo-first-order model, which can be expressed
by the equation  where C0 and Ct are the initial concentration
and concentration at reaction time (t), respectively,
while kapp is the apparent rate constant
that was obtained from the slope of the straight lines of ln(C0/Ct) versus reaction time (t). The kapp value at different concentrations was calculated and
shown in Figure 3d.
It is clearly seen that as the initial concentration of BPA increased
from 0.04 to 1.0 mmol L–1, the kapp value decreased from 0.0329 to 0.0048 min–1, indicating that the photodegradation rate was the highest at the
lowest concentration of BPA. The above results suggested that the
BPA molecules competed with each other more greatly when diffusing
to the catalytic active sites at the higher concentrations. This would
lower the kapp values. Although the kapp value was the lowest at 1.0 mmol L–1 of BPA, a full photodegradation of BPA was still possible after
prolonging the reaction time to 7 h.

2.3.4 Photodegradation
of MO
To gauge
the photocatalytic generality of DPPRD, it was further applied to
the photodegradation of the azo-dyes, which exist in majority in the
textile wastewater. MO is a typical azo-dye containing the N=N
double bond and the sulfonyl group bonded to the benzene ring. Figure 4a shows the results
of MO photodegradation carried out under visible light irradiation,
the time course of which was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy.
The UV–vis band at ca. 505 nm is assigned to MO. The band intensity
of MO with an initial concentration of 5 ppm exhibited a monotonic
decrease with reaction time. The photodegradation of the MO solutions
with different concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 30 ppm was also investigated
under the optimum conditions (Figure 4b). The DPPRD photocatalyst was highly active for the
degradation of MO under visible light irradiation. MO (5 ppm) was
degraded by 95% after visible light irradiation for 150 min. Furthermore,
the MO solution with higher concentrations could also be photodegraded
effectively after prolonging the visible light irradiation time. This
is probably related to the fact that more MO molecules were able to
be dispersed on the DPPRD surface, which made the reactive intermediate
species (radicals) rapidly convert during the photodegradation process.38 The corresponding pseudo-first-order kinetic
curves were calculated as shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S10c).

optimum conditions. (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra of MO solution (5 ppm) during the degradation process
and (b) effect of the initial concentration of MO.

2.4 Possible Mechanism of Photodegradation
on
DPPRD
For proposing the photocatalytic mechanism, investigation
of the active species during the photocatalytic processes is essential.39 Compounds n-butanol (n-BuOH), benzoquinone, and EDTA-2Na were introduced to BPA
or MO solution as the scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (•OH), superoxide radicals (O2•–), and hole (h+), respectively (Figure 5). The addition of benzoquinone showed a
minor influence on the degradation efficiency of both BPA and MO,
indicating that only a small amount of O2•– participated in the photodegradation reactions, whereas the addition
of n-BuOH or EDTA-2Na as scavengers of •OH or h+ distinctly retarded the degradation rate, implying
that •OH and h+ acted as major active
species in the photodegradation system under visible light irradiation.40

Figure 5 Effect of different scavengers on the photocatalytic degradation
of BPA and MO. EDTA-2Na (0.01 M), n-BuOH (0.5 M),
and benzoquinone (0.25 mM) were used as hole (h+), hydroxyl
radical (•OH), and superoxide radical (O2•–) scavengers, respectively.

On the basis of the above results and previous
literature,41−43 the photocatalysis mechanism on DPPRD can be explained
by the following
reactions. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  

The irradiation of
DPPRD by visible light produced the electrons
(ecb–) and holes (hvb+) (eq 1).41 The H2O2 molecules could
absorb visible light energy, generating •OH due
to the breakage of O–O bonds (eq 2). Both H2O2 and O2 were able to react with ecb– as electron
acceptors to generate •OH and O2•–, respectively (eqs 3–5). Moreover,
H2O2 could also react with O2•– because it was a better electron acceptor
than O2 (eq 6).42 However, an excess amount of H2O2 might react with •OH to form
HO2• (eq 8), which was less active
than •OH. A part of •OH might
recombine to form H2O (eq 9),43 leading to a decrease
in the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the appropriate amount
of initial H2O2 is very important in the photodegradation
system.

The photodegradation intermediates of BPA and MO were
investigated
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–mass spectrometry
(MS). The results of BPA degradation are shown in Figure 6. Prior to the irradiation,
there was a strong mass-to-charge (m/z) peak located at m/z 227 (Figure 6a), which could be
ascribed to the starting material of BPA. After 120 min of irradiation,
the peak of BPA disappeared; meanwhile, two new peaks at m/z 205 and 183 appeared (Figure 6b), indicating that the BPA molecules were
completely degraded into two intermediates, corresponding to compounds A and B, respectively. A further irradiation
for 60 min made the peak of A disappear but that of B increase; meanwhile, two prominent peaks at m/z 115 and 103 appeared (Figure 6c), corresponding to intermediates C and D, respectively. This indicated that A could be transformed into B, C, and D tandemly; meanwhile, a part of B was also degraded into C and D. However,
the amount of B produced from photodegradation of A was more than that of degraded B, resulting
in a slight increase in the intensity of peak of B. Then,
the reaction mixture was further illuminated for 60 min(Figure 6d), and the intensities of
the three peaks corresponding to B, C, and D decreased, indicating that the intermediates have been gradually
degraded to CO2 and H2O.

Figure 6 HPLC–MS analyses
of photodegradation intermediates of BPA
under irradiation for (a) 0, (b) 120, (c) 180, and (d) 240 min.

The analysis of photodegradation intermediates of MO at different
time intervals was shown in Figure 7. Initially, only the main peaks at m/z 304 that corresponded to the ionization of MO
were observed (Figure 7a). When the photodegradation reaction was carried out for 90 min,
two new peaks appeared at m/z 289
and 260, corresponding to intermediates E and F, respectively, with the decrease of the characteristic peak of MO
at m/z 304 (Figure 7b). After 150 min of irradiation, the peak
of MO became very low, indicating that MO was almost completely degraded
(Figure 7c). At the
same time, a new and prominent peak at m/z 156 appeared, corresponding to the fragmented compound G. Finally, all the peaks of intermediates gradually decreased
with further irradiation (Figure 7d), indicating that the intermediates generated were
further oxidized to CO2 and H2O.

Figure 7 HPLC–MS analyses
of photodegradation intermediates of MO
under irradiation for (a) 0, (b) 90, (c) 150, and (d) 240 min.

On the basis of the obtained intermediates
and previous literature,44,45 the routes for the
photocatalytic degradation of BPA and MO are
proposed and illustrated in Schemes 2 and S1 (see Supporting
Information), respectively. As shown in Scheme 2, the generated •OH radicals
could react with the aromatic ring of BPA, resulting in the formation
of unstable intermediates, which were not detected by HPLC–MS
and could be easily oxidized to organic acids A and B. A was subsequently transformed into B, C, and D; meanwhile, a part of B was also degraded to C and D.
The simple organic acids C and D were finally
mineralized to CO2 and H2O.

for the Photodegradation of BPA under Visible Light
2.5 Reuse of DPPRD Photocatalysts
The
stability and recyclability of a heterogeneous catalyst is very important
for its practical application. The recyclability of the photocatalyst
was investigated by reuse of DPPRD for the degradation of BPA and
MO. As shown in Figure 8, after five cycles for photodegradation of BPA and MO under the
same reaction conditions, the photodegradation rate remained above
91% for BPA and 88% for MO. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of fresh DPPRD and that reused five times showed very similar
peaks (Figure S12), which demonstrated
that the catalyst exhibited excellent chemical stability in the degradation
reactions under visible light irradiation.

3 Conclusions
A metal-free organic molecule
DPPRD has been synthesized by a facile
and simple method. DPPRD exhibited excellent chemical stability, high
visible light photocatalytic activity, and reusability for the photodegradation
of BPA and MO in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation.
A possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants
was proposed. This work not only verified that DPPRD has bright application
prospects in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants but
also provided a new strategy for application of metal-free organic
materials in the field of environmental purification.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of DPPRD
All chemicals
and reagents, purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company, were used without
any further purification. 3-Ethylrhodanine (1 mmol) and compound 1 (0.1 mmol) (Scheme 1) were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (30 mL) solution
and then triethylamine (1.5 mL) was added to the mixture. The resulting
mixture was stirred for 12 h under room temperature. The reaction
mixture was then extracted with CH2Cl2, washed
with water, and dried over MgSO4. After removal of the
solvent, the mixture was purified with methanol by recrystallization
two times, which afforded the product DPPRD as a dark green solid
(69 mg). Its chemical structure was determined by 1H NMR
spectroscopy (see the Supporting Information), showing chemical shifts (δ) of 9.17 (d, J = 4 Hz, 2H), 7.90 (s, 2H), 7.54 (d, J = 4 Hz, 2H),
4.2 (m, 4H), 4.09 (m, 4H), 1.93–1.84 (m, 2H), 1.38–1.27
(m, 16H), 0.96–0.86 (m, 18H).

4.2 Characterization
Methods
The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a
Bruker AVANCE III 400 spectrometer.
The chemical shift values (δ) were expressed in parts per million
by referring to the residual protons in CDCl3 solvent (δH = 7.26 ppm). High-resolution mass spectral data (HRMS) were
collected on a Bruker APEX II FT-MS mass spectrometer. The cyclic
voltammetry measurements were run on a CHI660C electrochemistry station
(CHI) at room temperature using three conventional electrodes, a platinum
working electrode, a saturated Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the
reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Tetrabutylammonium
phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in
CHCl3 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte,
and the scan rate was set at 100 mV s–1. TGA measurements
were performed on a STA PT1600 instrument (Linseis company) at a heating
rate of 10 K min–1 under a nitrogen flow. The UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectrum of DPPRD was recorded on a PerkinElmer
LAMBDA 35 UV/vis spectrometer using polytetrafluoroethylene as a reference
while that of the MO aqueous solution was recorded on a SPECORD-S600
spectrometer (Jena. Germany) equipped with 1.0 cm quartz cells. The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV
X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418
Å). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 80 FT-IR spectrometer
using the KBr pellets.

4.3 Photodegradation of BPA
or MO Solution
Photocatalytic activity tests were investigated
by the degradation
of BPA or MO in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation.
The reactions were performed in a quartz reactor with a cover using
a 250 W xenon lamp with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) as an
irradiation
source. In a typical experiment, 100 mL of BPA or MO solution (0.04–1.0
mM) and 2 mg of the catalyst were stirred in an air-saturated aqueous
solution at room temperature under dark for 2 h until reaching an
adsorption equilibrium. The adsorbed amount of BPA or MO the on surface
of DPPRD was analyzed to be less than 2%, which could be neglected
when calculating the catalytic conversion. An appropriate amount of
H2O2 was then added into the reactor and the
suspension was irradiated to start the photoreaction. During the irradiated
photoreaction, a proportion of the reaction mixture (ca. 2 mL) was
sampled at a time interval of 30 min. After removing the solid catalyst
by filtration through a membrane (0.45 μm), the amount of BPA
or MO remaining in the solution was analyzed by HPLC (Waters 2695-2489
HPLC, C18 (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) using CH3OH/H2O (70%:30%, pH = 5 adjusted by acetic acid)
as the eluent or a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The photodegradation
intermediates were identified by HPLC–MS on an Agilent Technologies
2690 instrument interconnected with a tandem ABSciex 5600+ TOF mass
spectrometer. An Eclipse Plus C18 (1.8 μm, 2.1 ×
60 mm, Agilent) column was used. The compounds of n-butanol (n-BuOH, 0.5 M), benzoquinone (0.25 mM),
and EDTA-2Na (0.01 M) were used as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), superoxide radicals (O2•–), and hole (h+) scavengers, respectively. The used DPPRD
catalysts were recovered by washing with distilled water and drying
at 353 K. The recycling experiments of the regenerated catalyst were
then subject to the photodegradation reactions under the aforementioned
experimental conditions.
