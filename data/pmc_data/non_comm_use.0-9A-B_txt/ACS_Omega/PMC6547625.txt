An automated approach
to the collection of 1H NMR (nuclear
magnetic resonance) spectra using a benchtop NMR spectrometer and
the subsequent analysis, processing, and elucidation of components
present in seized drug samples are reported. An algorithm is developed
to compare spectral data to a reference library of over 300 1H NMR spectra, ranking matches by a correlation-based score. A threshold
for identification was set at 0.838, below which identification of
the component present was deemed unreliable. Using this system, 432
samples were surveyed and validated against contemporaneously acquired
GC–MS (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) data. Following
removal of samples which possessed no peaks in the GC–MS trace
or in both the 1H NMR spectrum and GC–MS trace,
the remaining 416 samples matched in 93% of cases. Thirteen of these
samples were binary mixtures. A partial match (one component not identified)
was obtained for 6% of samples surveyed whilst only 1% of samples
did not match at all.

Introduction
The detection, and
identification, of drugs within a seized sample
is a desirable means of evidence and intelligence gathering.1 Given the growing issue of novel psychoactive
substances (NPS) and herbal products mixed with synthetic cannabinoids,
known as spice,2,3 a technique is required for the
detection of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) within a seized
sample, if indeed it is present. Such a technique is urgently needed,
given that the number of NPS reported to the European Monitoring Centre
for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has risen from 13 in 2008 to
101 in 20144 and that in 2016, a survey
of 625 UK inmates reported 33% had used spice in the last month.5

The established analytical tools of GC–MS
(gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry) and HPLC–MS (high performance liquid chromatography–MS),
which are employed by forensic laboratories (and by harm reduction
point-of-care services6) for the identification
and quantification of drugs of abuse, struggle with the high-throughput
that is required to test the number of seized samples. Additionally,
in some instances, the reference standards are not available for comparison.
Recently, a number of studies have been reported that focus on the
use of various spectroscopic techniques to achieve high sample throughput,
whilst also detecting the API present in seized samples. Studies have
utilized IR (infra-red) spectroscopy,7−10 Raman spectroscopy,11−14 NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance),9,10,15−17 HPLC,9,10,18−21 and GC–MS.9,10,22−25

IR and Raman spectroscopies
have been used for the analysis of
more than 200 seized NPS samples, resulting in the identification
of a single component or a mixture in 76% of the samples surveyed.26 17% of samples were partially identified, with
a further 7% that were unidentifiable. One of the limitations of this
study was the lack of reference spectra; the reference library needed
to be extended through the independent identification of NPS via NMR
and MS.

A recent development concerning Raman spectroscopy is
the use of
a portable hand-held technology for mobile detection. A study employing
785 and 1064 nm excitation sources highlighted that the latter wavelength
was more suitable, giving fewer false positives and false negatives
for the NPS screened whilst also significantly lowering fluorescence.27 In addition, IR has been used in conjunction
with chemometric methods (partial least squares (PLS) discriminant
analysis) to distinguish four classes of drugs with an average reliability
rate of 98.6% for the 932 samples surveyed.8 A further use of PLS-based analysis in conjunction with Raman and
IR spectroscopies has been exemplified for the quantification of cocaine
in samples consisting of cocaine, sodium carbonate, and either caffeine
or lidocaine.28

A further study utilized
liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution
MS for the detection of NPS in wastewater from a festival in Amsterdam.29 Implementation of an algorithm to extract accurate
masses which were then compared to an in-house database of 2000 entries
of NPS and transformation products facilitated the detection of eight
NPS compounds.

The combination of dopant-assisted positive photoionization
ion
mobility spectrometry (DAPP-IMS) and direct analysis in real time
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-TOF MS) has been employed successfully
to screen drug samples with minimal sample preparation.30 Although the method provided a fast response
and high-throughput, the method was limited due to its inability to
identify all the components in a mixture or unambiguously identify
similar compounds, such as epimers.

A method utilizing GC–MS
for the analysis of cathinones,
amphetamine-like stimulants, and other NPS has been developed that
incorporates an almost simultaneous derivatization and extraction
step, which is achieved through the use of hexyl chloroformate and
dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction.22 The chromatographic method allowed the separation of 26
stimulants, which were all resolved in under 15 min.

The development
of a compound database and HRMS (high-resolution
mass spectrometry) spectral library, consisting of data for 875 and
252 NPS from multiple classes, respectively, has been utilized for
the analysis of 13 serum samples that had been spiked with up to five
NPS per sample.31 32 of the 35 compounds
present were detected using the method developed. Furthermore, HRMS-based
screening of four seized samples provided results consistent with
official forensic laboratory findings.

NMR, despite being a
powerful analytical technique, has been underutilized
for the detection of drugs within samples. This is largely because
of the perceived complexity of the measurement but also the inherent
cost of requiring a superconducting magnet and the associated technical
costs. However, the recent development of bench-top NMR spectrometers
has made this technique a much more attractive and affordable prospect.
This approach is exemplified through the identification of drugs in
real case samples, carried out for two samples, using a limited library
of twelve spectra on a benchtop 80 MHz spectrometer and compared by
visual inspection with data collected on a 600 MHz spectrometer.32 Another report has investigated the differentiation
of 65 fentanyl analogues, by eye, using 1H NMR spectra
obtained on a low-field spectrometer (62 MHz).33 Quantum mechanical spin system analysis was employed in
this report, and this highlighted that field strength-independent 1H NMR libraries could be useful for drug analysis. Furthermore,
the quantification of components in over-the-counter painkiller drugs
has been utilized in an undergraduate practical, again using a visual
inspection to identify the various components.16

Screening of spice samples using low-field NMR has
been explored
by Gilard and co-workers.34 In their study,
nine synthetic cannabinoids were detected and quantified. Although
high-field NMR spectroscopy, sometimes in conjunction with mass spectrometry,
is required for unambiguous structural identification, low-field NMR
provided useful insights, in the form of diagnostic signals, as to
their chemical structure. However, the greater spectral band overlap
compared to data acquired from a superconducting system did present
a data analysis challenge.

In this paper, we detail a fully
automated NMR system that acquires
the 1H NMR spectrum of a sample, processes it, and then
using a developed pattern recognition algorithm, compares the spectrum
to a reference library of over 300 1H NMR spectra, before
finally reporting the drug(s) present (if there are any to detect).
The simplistic nature of the experimental measurement overcomes the
need for dedicated technical staff, and the robustness of the algorithm
for spectral analysis means that it can be readily utilized in custodial
suites.

Results and Discussion
Reference Library and Algorithm Development
1H NMR spectra of all reference compounds were collected
using the
Pulsar instrument. The reference library thus consisted of 302 spectra
altogether. The large number and types of materials represented in
the reference library enable a wide range of seized materials to be
identified and also allow for various tests of the performance of
the pattern recognition algorithm.

The 1H NMR spectra
were truncated into two discrete sections: the “class”
region (0.46–1.54 ppm) and a fingerprint region (3.90–12.50
ppm). “Classes” of compounds possess similar backbone
structures, and hence spectral features, but it was imperative that
the algorithm developed could also differentiate compounds within
a class. Both sections were used in the pattern recognition process.
Further, to account for some variations in the dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) signal that was used as an internal standard, the algorithm
accommodated a tolerance of ±0.06 ppm on the chemical shift of
any peak.

Before commencing any analysis of seized samples,
the algorithm’s
performance in terms of correct identifications was tested by using
it to the validation sample spectra. This allowed evaluation of technical
repeatability, as well as the ability of the method to detect and
identify previously unseen mixtures and an estimation of the rate
of false-positives.

Of the 130 controlled substance replicates,
the class was correctly
identified in all but one of the samples (>99% success rate) and
the
compound in all but six (>95% success rate). Notably, all of these
were from the diphenidine class, of which 5 were misidentified as
other closely related diphenidines. Note that the diphenidines were
somewhat over-represented amongst the technical replicates due to
the ready availability of these compounds.

The algorithm produces
a “match score” as an output
for each sample: this is the largest of the Pearson’s correlations
between the sample spectrum and each of the library spectra. The median
score from correct identifications across all classes was 0.993. In
contrast, the median score for the incorrect identifications was 0.96.
A summary figure expanding on these values is given in the Supporting Information. It is worth noting that
the median score for the amphetamine class was 0.993 and that this
was also the individual score for the technical replicate of MDMA;
this was the most prevalent compound amongst the seized samples discussed
below.

For the 32 validation mixtures, there were 21 correct
identifications
of both compounds present in the sample. The median match score for
these was 0.923. This is substantially lower than the typical match
scores for single compounds, reflecting the increased difficulty of
identifying unknown binary mixtures of unknown concentration ratios.
A further 10 were identified as single compounds instead of mixtures,
with one of the two compounds being correctly identified. The final
sample was found to be a mixture, but one of the individual compounds
was incorrectly identified as a different cutting agent; importantly,
therefore, this was not a false positive with regards to controlled
substances. From consideration of the outcomes from the validation
samples, a threshold was set empirically at 0.838: match scores greater
than this are indicative of a correct match, whereas identifications
with lower scores are considered unreliable.

Analysis of Seized Samples
432 seized samples were
analyzed as part of this work. These samples represent a seized material
within the Greater Manchester region and tested by the MANchester
DRug Analysis & Knowledge Exchange (MANDRAKE) partnership in accordance
with the UK Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) and Misuse of Drugs Regulations
(2001). All samples were analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy
(ca. 5–10 mg of sample dissolved in 0.6 mL of deuterated DMSO)
and GC–MS (see Supporting Information for method and sample preparation). The results from the 1H NMR analysis were cross-referenced with GC–MS data acquired
from the same sample. The GC–MS validation approach is outlined
in the Supporting Information. Compounds
identified through the work detailed herein are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Compounds detected in
the seized samples as part of this work.

Of the 432 samples analyzed, thirteen (3%) possessed no peaks
in
the GC–MS chromatogram. Of these, 1H NMR analysis
identified that adulterants such as lactose were present, which would
require derivatization before they could be detected by GC–MS.
Two samples were identified as containing lactose only (median match
score 0.964) and another one as sucrose only (match score 0.968).
Two further samples were indicated to be comprised of sodium gamma-hydroxybutyric
acid with a median match score of 0.851. The other eight samples possessed
match scores below the identification threshold (i.e. lower than 0.838),
and thus their identifications were considered unreliable.

Three
samples returned a null result in both the 1H
NMR and GC–MS, that is, they consisted of no material that
possessed a 1H NMR signature, and no peak was observed
in the GC–MS trace.

The other 416 samples resulted in
partial or complete agreement
between the 1H NMR and the GC–MS outcomes. Of these
416 samples, the result from the 1H NMR analysis matched
the GC–MS result exactly in 387 cases (93%), thirteen of which
were identified as being binary mixtures by both GC–MS and 1H NMR. Partial agreement was obtained for 25 (6%) of samples
surveyed, whilst the outcomes from just 4 samples (1%) did not match
at all. A partial match here means that either the 1H NMR
analysis or the GC–MS trace were missing one or more components
than the other method detected.

By far the most common drug
identified was MDMA, accounting for
171 instances (40% of samples surveyed). Cocaine and ketamine (85
(20%) and 74 (17%) instances respectively) were the next most common.
Samples found to contain mephedrone, paracetamol, benzocaine, ethylone,
heroin, caffeine, diazepam, or cannabis accounted for a further 23
samples (5% of samples surveyed). Figure 2 shows the percentage breakdown by class
of single and binary component samples. A recent report from a UK
festival onsite drug checking service reported that the three most
common drugs identified were MDMA (57%), ketamine (13.5%), and cocaine
(10%).35 The results presented here reaffirm
these drugs as the most commonly encountered and with similar frequencies.

showing the relative numbers of samples of different
compositions, as identified by 1H NMR analysis and subsequently
validated by GC–MS, for (a) single component samples and (b)
binary mixtures.

The median match score
for the seized MDMA samples was found to
be 0.986 (range 0.858–0.997). This implies that some of the
samples analyzed were almost of reference standard quality. In theory,
an exact match with a reference compound will have a score of 1; in
practice, sources of variance such as instrumental drift, spectral
noise, and concentration differences mean that this is rarely achieved.
The value obtained for the technical replicate of the reference MDMA
discussed above was 0.993. Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectral variation of
ten seized samples containing MDMA in comparison to the 1H NMR reference spectrum of MDMA.

Figure 3 Series of 1H NMR spectra of
MDMA. Spectrum 1 is the
reference spectrum that is included in the reference library, whereas
spectra 2–11 are seized samples (sample IDs 123, 207, 244,
309, 377, 405, 561B, 582, 598A, 598B, and 613).

Similarly, ketamine and cocaine samples had median match
scores
of 0.980 and 0.973 respectively. For the cocaine samples, the 1H NMR analysis was able to differentiate between the free-base
form and the hydrochloride salt. Four instances of free-base cocaine
were found, for which the median match score was 0.184 higher than
that of cocaine hydrochloride (median match-score for free-base cocaine
was found to be 0.987). The difference between the two match scores
is important, as the match score for cocaine hydrochloride is below
the validation threshold in some instances. Although the 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis reveals this difference, GC–MS
only reports the presence of cocaine.

It is noteworthy that
MDMA and ketamine both possess amine protons
and the 1H NMR chemical shift is concentration-dependent
(see Figure 3 for the
variation of the amine protons of MDMA at ca. δ 9.1). Thus,
the algorithm developed was able to successfully deal with this and
still match the 1H NMR spectrum to that of the reference
spectrum. The use of deuterated DMSO also prevents this amine proton
from being deuterated, and thus the molecule is not needed to be chemically
changed to facilitate its successful detection. The median match scores
for the other single component samples are shown in Table 1.

The detection of 6-Br-MDMA in eight samples (two as
the sole component
and six as a binary mixture with magnesium stearate) highlights a
way in which the method can be used to identify a drug class, despite
the material not being in the reference library. Initial analysis
of these eight samples indicated that the material was a possible
unknown—all the match scores were below the validation threshold
as they ranged from 0.755 to 0.644. Five samples reported the sample
consisting of an amphetamine (MDMA), whilst the other three were indicated
to be N-ethylpentylone hydrochloride, or a precursor
to its production, piperonal. Despite the range of materials suggested,
there is commonality, in that all of the compounds possess a 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene
ring, with the benzene ring possessing a substituted aliphatic chain
or functional group. Analysis of the GC–MS traces for these
eight compounds identified a single component that had a retention
time of 6.7 min. Subsequent analysis of the samples using high-field 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and MS in conjunction
with previously reported36 MS data revealed
the structure to be 6-Br-MDMA. A sample was synthesized and the reference
library updated accordingly with its 1H NMR spectrum. This
enabled two of the samples to be identified as 6-Br-MDMA with a median
match-score of 0.896, although a further reference sample needed to
be created to correctly identify the other six, due to the presence
of magnesium stearate. These samples are discussed further in the
mixtures section.

The detection of diazepam in two samples required
a modification
of the general procedure to enable its analysis by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. In general benzodiazepines such as diazepam are produced
as tablets which contain a large concentration of lactose. When part
of the tablet is dissolved in DMSO both the API and excipient are
soluble. The lactose is in such a high concentration that it swamps
the signals from the diazepam. The subsequent result from matching
the fingerprint is usually lactose. By contrast, the benzodiazepines
are soluble in acetonitrile while the lactose is practically insoluble.
Repeating the sample prep using deuterated acetonitrile in place of
DMSO-d6 allowing the 1H NMR
data acquisition and analysis to be performed under the same conditions
as the other samples analyzed. The corresponding median match score
for these two samples was 0.959. There are other misused pharmaceuticals
which may present a similar issue with the analysis, for example,
buprenorphine. The procedure using deuterated acetonitrile is also
applicable in these cases.

Of the 416 samples exhibiting GC–MS
peaks, 24 samples were
identified as synthetic cannabinoids, of which one was a mixture.
The synthetic cannabinoids needed extracting from the plant material
and were not seized as crystalline materials. All of the samples were
typically less than 1.5% API by weight (see Supporting Information for details on the experimental protocol used to
determine this) with only three samples possessing more than this
threshold (highest 3.8%). Twenty samples were found to comprise 5F-ADB
as the sole API. We note here that some of match scores for the samples
were very similar to other materials in the database. For example,
four samples had match scores that differed by only 0.001–0.005
compared to that of buprenorphine hydrochloride whilst another two
samples were 0.003–0.008 different to MMB-CHMINACA. A further
three samples were indicated to be 5F-ADB by GC–MS but gave
a null response in terms of the 1H NMR analysis. The GC–MS
traces for these three samples indicated that the API was 0.3–0.7%.
It is notable that of the four samples that did not produce a match
between the GC–MS result and that of the 1H NMR
analysis, three of them were synthetic cannabinoid samples.

Mixtures
The algorithm developed is capable of detecting
binary mixtures, which is commonplace for drugs (e.g. cocaine) as
they are “cut” with another material. Of the samples
analyzed, thirteen samples were identified as being a binary mixture
by both GC–MS and 1H NMR, with a further 26 samples
being identified as being a partial match, that is, one component
not identified in the 1H NMR spectrum when two or more
are present in the GC–MS trace, or vice versa.

Of the
thirteen binary mixtures correctly identified, 69% of these were cocaine
based, the other 31% were amphetamine and caffeine (two instances)
and benzocaine and ketamine (two instances). The cocaine samples were
cut with caffeine, levamisole, benzocaine, or phenacetin. Four samples
were identified as being a mixture of cocaine and levamisole by GC–MS
(retention times 8.22 and 7.50 min respectively) and also by 1H NMR analysis (median match score 0.885). Following analysis
of the gas chromatogram, the amount of levamisole in these samples
was observed to range from 3.6 to 17.6%. The success of the 1H NMR analysis is particularly noteworthy here, given that levamisole
and cocaine have similar aromatic moieties and therefore overlap in
the 1H NMR spectrum. The class region is key to distinguishing
between the two different components in these cases, whilst also facilitating
the identification of both components present.

One instance
of a cocaine and phenacetin mixture was identified
by 1H NMR (match score 0.837) and validated by the GC–MS
data. Analysis of the gas chromatogram revealed that cocaine was prevalent
in this mixture (79.4% cocaine and 20.6% phenacetin). The relative
amount of cocaine in the single instance of cocaine mixed with caffeine
was 90.2%. The match score for this sample was 0.922. A similar median
match-score (0.849) was obtained for the two cocaine and benzocaine
samples despite the composition of cocaine varying from 24.7 to 80.9%.

Two samples were identified as amphetamine and caffeine (1H NMR median match score 0.890). From GC analysis, the relative amount
of amphetamine present ranged from 23.3 to 36.7%. Similarly, the two
samples that returned ketamine and benzocaine by both 1H NMR and GC–MS analysis had a 1H NMR median match
score of 0.919.

Partial Matches
26 samples were
identified as partial
matches. Six of these that contained 6-Br-MDMA, in its hydrochloride
form, were found to also consist of magnesium stearate. In the absence
of 6-Br-MDMA, magnesium stearate does not dissolve in DMSO, as evidenced
by the lack of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. However, it
was observed that if magnesium stearate was added to a sample of 6-Br-MDMA
hydrochloride in DMSO, a new peak was observed at 1.21 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum with concomitant loss of the amine peak at
9.23 ppm (see Supporting Information for 1H NMR spectra). It is believed that a disproportionation reaction
had occurred, leading to the exchange of the chloride for stearate
which resulted in magnesium chloride being formed. The practice of
increasing the water solubility of drugs using disproportionation
is well-documented.37−40 Some samples were more heavily cut with magnesium stearate than
others, and thus a reference 1H NMR spectrum of 6-Br-MDMA
with magnesium stearate was required. A suitable sample was prepared,
a 1H NMR spectrum acquired, and the reference library was
updated accordingly. Subsequently, the median match score for the
six seized samples was 0.926. These were recorded as partial matches
because magnesium stearate cannot be observed under the GC–MS
conditions employed and so could not be validated.

Ten cocaine
binary mixtures were recorded as partial matches, with a further three
that were found to be tertiary mixtures and one that comprised six
components. One of the tertiary mixtures by GC–MS proved to
comprise benzocaine, paracetamol, and cocaine in a ratio of 6.6:15.8:77.6.
The 1H NMR analysis, which is limited to reporting on binary
mixtures only, returned paracetamol and cocaine as the match, with
a match score of 0.926. Benzocaine was not reported, most likely due
to the low concentration present in the sample. Similarly, another
tertiary mixture was identified to be cocaine, benzocaine, and levamisole
by GC–MS and returned cocaine and benzocaine as the match in
the 1H NMR analysis with a match score of 0.869. As levamisole
is only present at a level of 0.4%, it is not surprising that the 1H NMR analysis identified the two most prevalent components.
The final tertiary mixture was found to consist of cocaine, ketamine,
and benzocaine in a 35.6:35.7:28.7 ratio. The match scores for benzocaine
and cocaine, and benzocaine and ketamine, differ by only 0.007 for
this sample being 0.856 and 0.849, respectively. Thus, despite the
algorithm being limited to detecting two components only, appraisal
of the match scores can provide evidence for the presence of three
components in a mixture.

The six-component mixture consisted
of cocaine, levamisole, hexadecanoic
acid, tolycaine, heptan-3-ol, and phenacetin with cocaine (87.9%)
and phenacetin (7.4%) being the most prevalent. The 1H
NMR analysis reported cocaine and phenacetin with a match-score of
0.862. It is noteworthy that the other components were all present
at a level of 3% or lower, and this will have hindered their detection
in the 1H NMR spectrum.

Of the ten cocaine binary
mixtures, three samples did not return
cocaine as the primary identified API. All of these samples comprised
largely of benzocaine (>79%), and hence, the 1H NMR
spectrum
was dominated by the signals of benzocaine. Furthermore, the lower
molecular weight of benzocaine compared to cocaine results in lower
signal intensity of the latter in the 1H NMR spectrum,
also hindering its detection.

A further six samples were cocaine
and levamisole binary mixtures.
For five of these samples, levamisole comprised <2% of the sample
according to GC–MS analysis (with one exception where the levamisole
was present at the 5% level), and this might have prevented its detection
in the 1H NMR analysis. The other sample indicated levamisole
as an additional component in the 1H NMR analysis. Although
this represents a false-positive hit, the important aspect is that
cocaine is detected in the sample as this is the main API. The final
cocaine containing sample was shown to be cut with caffeine but only
at the level of 1%. Again, this low amount is not conducive to its
detection by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

The remaining six
samples were indicated by 1H NMR to
have one too few or one too many components compared to the GC–MS
trace. One of these samples returned only AMB-FUBINACA by 1H NMR whilst the GC–MS showed it comprised the former as well
as 5F-ADB. Both components on a weight-by-weight basis were <2.5%,
with AMB-FUBINACA being present at almost five times the amount of
5F-ADB. Another sample was shown to comprise alpha-d-lactose
and caffeine whereas GC–MS reported only caffeine; this is
as expected, as lactose would need to be derivatized in order to be
detectable under the GC conditions employed. Another sample of note
here is one that comprised methiopropamine and 2-aminoindane by GC–MS
but was determined to be methiopropamine and amphetamine sulfate following 1H NMR analysis. Despite the difference in compositions, it
must be noted that 2-aminoindane is the rigid analogue of amphetamine
and hence has similar 1H NMR resonances; thus there is
a scientific rationale for its detection following 1H NMR
analysis.

Conclusions
There is a need for
a high-throughput analytical technique with
facile sample preparation to deal with increasing numbers of drug
seizures made by law agencies. This paper presents an approach comprising
an automated NMR benchtop spectrometer, which acquires, processes,
and interprets the spectral data with minimum user knowledge. The
findings of the analysis are reported in around 5 min.

The approach
makes use of an algorithm that analyses the acquired 1H
NMR spectrum by matching it to a library of over 300 reference
spectra from known substances. 432 seized samples were tested using
this system, and the outcomes compared with GC–MS data, a currently
accepted reference method (see Table 2). The GC–MS trace in thirteen cases (3% of
the samples surveyed) were devoid of any peaks, so the 1H NMR analysis could not be validated for these samples. A further
three samples were found to lack any API or cutting agent after both 1H NMR and GC–MS analysis.

% partially matched (two or more component samples)	5.8 (25)	
a The number in parentheses indicate
the number of samples of that type.

For the remaining 416 samples, the outcomes by GC–MS
and 1H NMR matched in 93% of cases. Of these, thirteen
samples
were identified as being a binary mixture by both GC–MS and 1H NMR. A partial match (one component not identified) was
obtained for 6% of samples surveyed, whilst only 1% of samples resulted
in contradictory outcomes.

The analytical predictive power of
the algorithm was exemplified
in the detection of 6-Br-MDMA which identified the methylenedioxy
ring structure and the class of compound. Further characterization
of the samples, and the synthesis of a reference sample, led to the
complete elucidation of the chemical structure. Note that the disproportionation
of chloride for stearate from magnesium stearate present in the majority
of seized samples of this type required an additional reference 1H NMR spectrum to be acquired and the spectral library updated
accordingly. Eight samples were found to possess 6-Br-MDMA as the
API, with six of these being heavily cut with magnesium stearate,
as indicated by the match scores.

The protocol was modified
for the detection of benzodiazepines,
for example, diazepam. Deuterated acetonitrile was used instead, but
the methodology for detection, acquisition, processing, and reporting
remained consistent with that of the samples collected in deuterated
DMSO.

Having demonstrated the validity of the approach, future
work will
be directed toward a quantification method to widen the applicability
of the qualitative approach employed here, and to improve the ability
to handle multicomponent mixtures.

Methodology
Materials
302 reference compounds were synthesized
(see below) or obtained either from Fluorochem (UK), Sigma Aldrich
(UK), BRC Fine Chemicals (https://www.brc-finechemicals.com/—prior to the UK Psychoactive
Substances Act (2016), which came in to effect on the 26th May 2016
and made it an offence to manufacture, supply, possess, and import
and export psychoactive substances named in this Act) or Carbosynth
(UK). The following groups of chemicals were synthesized according
to, or adapted from, the literature references cited: 4-methoxyamphetamines,41 2-, 3- and 4-fluoroamphetamines,42 thiopropamine,43 methiopropamine,44 dimethyldiphenidines,23 3- and 4-chloroethcathinone,45 trifluoromethylmethcathinones,45 3- and 4-chloro N,N-diethylcathinones,46 2-, 3- and 4-methcathinones,46 2-, 3- and 4-fluoromethcathinones,47 diphenidine and ephenidine derivatives,23 fentanyl derivatives,48 fluorolintanes,23 25I-,25B-, 25C-, and
25F-NBOMe,49 MMB-CHMINACA, MMB-CHMICA,
5F-ADB, AMB-FUBINACA, and AB-FUBINACA,50 2C-C, 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-F, and 2C-H.51 All
synthesized reference standards were fully characterized and exhibited
physical and spectral data consistent with the literature and determined
to be >99% pure by high-field NMR. These consisted of a range of
narcotics,
NPS, and controlled substances, as well as commonly encountered non-controlled
substances and adulterants. In total, there were 21 classes of compound:
aminoindanes, amphetamines, atypical diphenidines, benzodiazepines,
cathinones, diphenidines, ephenidines, fentanyls, fluorolintanes,
methylenedioxycathinones, NBOMe, narcotics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals,
phenethylamines, piperazines (including MT-45 and its derivatives),
precursors, steroids, and synthetic cannabinoids. Two further “classes”
of non-controlled substances were also included: a range of “cutting
agents” and “background residues” (i.e., only
DMSO).

432 seized samples of unknown identity were obtained
from Greater Manchester Police via the MANchester DRug Analysis &
Knowledge Ex-change (MANDRAKE) partnership and were stored and analyzed
in accordance with the UK Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) and Misuse of
Drugs Regulations (2001). The samples were collected over the period
January 2017–August 2018. All of these samples were supplied
in their solid, bulk forms. For the seized materials, a micro-spatula
tip of the material (ca. 5–10 mg) was dissolved in 0.6 mL of
deuterated DMSO. If diazepam was suspected, then 0.6 mL of deuterated
acetonitrile was used instead. For spice samples, approximately 50
mg of material was weighed out and 0.6 mL of deuterated DMSO added.
The spice material was heavily agitated to ensure that the API became
dissolved in the DMSO. All samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm
polyvinylidene difluoride syringe filter (Whatman) directly into a
NMR tube. Samples were analyzed by 1H NMR and validated
against contemporaneously acquired GC–MS data (GC–MS
method outlined in Supporting Information).

The reference samples were prepared for NMR analysis by
dissolving
10 mg of compound per 1 mL of deuterated DMSO, or in the case of diazepam,
deuterated MeCN.

130 compounds from the reference collection
were available in sufficient
quantity to prepare a replicate sample. All but three of the controlled
substance classes (NBOMe, 2C-derivatives and piperazines) were represented
in this validation collection. A further 32 samples of non-controlled
substances in the reference collection were prepared in pairwise combinations,
to assist with development of the mixture identification method.

NMR Data Acquisition
1H NMR spectra were
acquired of all samples using a Pulsar benchtop NMR spectrometer (Oxford
Instruments, Abingdon, UK) operating at a frequency of 59.7 MHz. The
temperature of the probe was calculated to be 308.5 K by measuring
the separation (in Hz, Δδ) between the CH2 and
OH signals of neat ethylene glycol and implementing the equation T [K] = 466.5 – 102.00Δδ.52 After the sample had been inserted, an automated
procedure began whereby the instrument would lock on to the deuterated
signature of DMSO (thus used as a chemical shift reference) before
acquiring 16 scans (for the spice samples, 64 scans were acquired).

Following acquisition, the data were processed in MNova (Mestrelab
Research, Santiago de Compostela, Spain) using an automated script
file. The processed FID was then analyzed by the pattern recognition
algorithm, developed in-house using Matlab (The Mathworks Inc, Cambridge,
UK). The algorithm employs a minimum distance classifier. The multivariate
distance between the sample spectrum and each of the reference spectra
is calculated. The sample is identified as the nearest reference compound,
provided the “match score” (equal to one minus the distance)
exceeds an (empirically determined) threshold; if it does not, then
the outcome is considered to be tentative, unreliable, or unknown.
Binary mixtures are accommodated by extending the pattern search with
synthetically generated mixture spectra of pairwise combinations of
the reference library.

The collection of NMR data and the subsequent
analysis takes approximately
5 min. If signal-to-noise was found to be poor, more scans were obtained.
This was only required in less than 1% of the samples being analyzed,
and this was due to the amount of sample available being low, for
example, the residue material within plastic packets used to transport
illicit materials.
