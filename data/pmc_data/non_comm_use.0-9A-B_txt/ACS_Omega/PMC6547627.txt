Natural
cellulose-based materials (CBMs) have considerable potential
as strong and lightweight materials for advanced structural applications.
Herein, we demonstrate a mechanically strong yet lightweight CBM with
highly aligned wood fibers by the coupling pulping of wood blocks
with mechanical pressing, which exhibits a tensile strength of 719.0
± 30.2 MPa, an elastic modulus of 19.0 ± 1.4 GPa, and a
density of 1.32 g/cm3. The extraordinary mechanical properties
of the CBM are mainly ascribed to the good orientation of wood fibers
in the longitudinal direction as well as the dramatically increased
hydrogen bonds among adjacent fiber cells due to the lignin removal
and mechanical pressing. More significantly, the resulting sheet-like
anisotropic CBMs can be used to fabricate anisotropic and isotropic
bulk CBMs with maximum tensile strengths of 561 and 330 MPa, respectively,
through a facile and scalable layer-by-layer stacking method. This
work exploits the mechanical potential of cellulose and the large-scale
production of anisotropic and isotropic bulk CBMs with extraordinary
mechanical performance and may open up a range of novel applications
to CBMs.

==== Body
Introduction
Modern society has long been sought to
achieve strong yet lightweight
materials for advanced applications ranging from building, transportation,
and medical instruments to electronics, power plant, and aerospace.
Unfortunately, most of the current high-performance materials are
nonrenewable and nonbiodegradable, which fails to fulfill the growing
requirement of sustainable development.1−4 Cellulose-based materials (CBMs) from wood
not only are earth-abundant, renewable, and environmentally beneficial
but also have the potential to be mechanically strong, light weight,
and stiff, which can be given high-priority consideration to alleviate
our reliance on petroleum-based materials, steel, and concrete.5−7

From the structural point of view, crystalline cellulose of
an
elementary fibril has a tensile strength of 7.5–7.7 GPa and
Young’s modulus of 110–220 GPa,8−10 exceeding those
of glass, Kevlar, and steel fibers. Micro-sized cellulose fibers self-assembled
by helically aligned elementary fibrils exhibit remarkably reduced
mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 0.3–1.4 GPa
and Young’s modulus of 14–27 GPa.11 For bulk wood consisting of microscale cellulose fibers,
50–140 MPa tensile strength and 2–14 GPa modulus are
obtained,12 indicating the sharp decrease
of mechanical properties during the biosynthesis. Therefore, how to
transfer the extraordinary mechanical performance of cellulose to
bulk CBMs is an urgent issue to be overcome.

Recently, tremendous
efforts have been devoted to produce strong
CBMs by rational orientation of micro and nanocellulose fibers, which
enable the effective transformation of the superior mechanical properties
of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) into bulk CBMs.13−20 For example, Nishino et al. developed an all-cellulose composite
material by impregnating manually aligned ramie fibers into molecular
cellulose solution. The resulting all-cellulose composite exhibited
an ultimate tensile strength of 480 MPa and an elastic modulus of
45 GPa.21 Mechanical stretching is an efficient
approach to orientate CNFs in the planar direction.13,17−20 Sehaqui et al. prepared strong nanopaper by cold drawing of the
CNF hydrogel. After drawing, the tensile strength increased from 185
to 397 MPa while the modulus increased from 10.3 to 33.3 GPa.20

To further improve the mechanical properties
of CBMs by mechanical
stretching, Tang and co-workers demonstrated a macroscopic ribbon
with strong tensile strength (576 ± 54 MPa) and modulus (32.3
± 5.7 GPa) by grafting of CNFs with ethylene glycol which can
prevent CNF agglomeration, thus facilitating the subsequent alignment
of CNF during mechanical stretching.19 However,
the inefficiency and complexity of these methods limited the scalable
preparation of strong CBMs. Moreover, the mechanical performance of
these CBMs is much lower than that of a single CNF.22 Lately, Hu’s group proposed a facile top-down approach
to process natural wood into a high-performance bulk CBM for structural
applications. The resulting bulk CBM possesses a tensile strength
of 548.8.3 ± 47.2 MPa, resulting from the utilization of well-aligned
wood fibers in natural wood.23

Herein,
we demonstrated strong and lightweight CBMs with highly
aligned micro-sized wood fibers. Wood blocks were treated with an
aqueous sodium hydroxide–anthraquinone (NaOH–AQ) system
to remove lignin while maintaining the well-aligned configuration
of wood fibers in the longitudinal direction, and the delignified
wood blocks were then mechanically pressed with a presser to increase
the hydrogen bonds among cellulose fibers that facilitated the increase
in tensile strength of the as-prepared CBMs. More significantly, anisotropic
and isotropic bulk CBMs with fascinating mechanical properties were
presented by a layer-by-layer stacking approach. Our work exploits
the mechanical potential of the cellulose and the large-scale production
of bulk CBMs with superior mechanical performance, which may open
up a range of novel applications to CBMs.

Results and Discussion
Transferring the exceptional mechanical performance of the cellulose
to bulk CBMs is still challenging. Herein, we fabricated CBMs with
extraordinary mechanical properties by a combination of delignification
and mechanical pressing. Figure 1a highlights a straightforward method to fabricate
a strong CBM by delignification and mechanical pressing of natural
wood. Wood blocks obtained by longitudinally cutting the wood trunk
were cooked by NaOH–AQ liquor to remove the lignin and hemicellulose
as much as possible, leading to softening of the well-aligned structure
of wood fibers. Removing the lignin in the middle lamella can dramatically
promote the subsequent formation of hydrogen bonding among aligned
fiber cells during mechanical pressing. After this, the delignified
wood block with aligned wood fibers was mechanically pressed to prepare
a strong CBM (Figure 1b). The as-fabricated CBM notably exhibits a strong tensile strength
of 773 MPa (Figure 1c), which is shown to be higher than those of typical metals (AlSi10Mg
alloy24 and high specific-strength steel25), and even of lightweight titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V)26 and those of other CBMs (polyethylene glycol-grafted
CNF ribbon19 and densified wood23) as shown in Figure 1d.

A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to
investigate
the microscopic structure of natural wood, delignified wood, and CBM
prepared from natural wood. SEM images in Figure 2a demonstrate the ordered orientation of
wood lumina parallel to the growth direction of tree. The cell walls
adhere to each other by a mixture of the lignin and hemicellulose.
However, the tight adhesion between neighboring fiber cells becomes
loose after pulping because the lignin in the middle lamella was removed
(Figure 2b). Figure 2c shows the good
preservation of the alignment feature of fiber cells during the fabrication
process. The magnified SEM images in Figure 2d indicate that there are many rectangle-like
pores (cell lumina) with a diameter of 30–50 μm, and
the boundaries between adjacent cell walls are fuzzy due to the existence
of the heavily lignified middle lamella. After delignification, visible
gaps between adjacent cell walls appear due to the removal of the
middle lamella (Figure 2e). Mechanical pressing along the radial direction was applied to
compress the loose configuration of delignified wood into a dense
structure with approximately a six-time reduction in thickness. No
conspicuous lumina is seen from the SEM images in Figure 2f, which suggests that more
hydrogen bonding among aligned fiber are forming during mechanical
pressing. Thus, the oriented arrangement of microstructures along
with the increased numbers of hydrogen bonds leads to the super tensile
strength of CBMs.

In summary, the preparation strategy
proposed in this study not
only preserves the ordered arrangement of fiber cells in wood but
also promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds. The well-aligned arrangement
of microscale structures along with the rising numbers of hydrogen
bonds contributes to transferring the outstanding mechanical potential
of wood fibers to CBMs.

Thanks to the good preservation of highly
aligned microstructures
and the increased number of hydrogen bonds among adjacent cell walls
during the fabrication, the resulting CBMs exhibit excellent mechanical
properties with an average tensile strength of 719.0 ± 30.2 MPa
and Young’s modulus of 19.0 ± 1.4 GPa. The maximum stress
of the CBM in the longitudinal direction is approximately 15 times
stronger than that of original wood (46.5 ± 5.10 MPa), and its
maximum Young’s modulus is nearly 4 times larger than that
of original wood (Figure 4a, Table 1).

Table 1 Lignin Content, Tensile Strength,
and Modulus of Natural Wood Blocks and CBMs with Different Cooking
Times

lignin content (%)	27.3 ± 0.09	12.8 ± 0.11	5.8 ± 0.08	3.76 ± 0.05	2.12 ± 0.06	
tensile strength (MPa)	46.5 ± 5.10	470.3 ± 19.60	563.1 ± 26.40	719.0 ± 30.18	615.6 ± 25.50

As we mentioned above, lignin removal in wood can facilitate the
formation of hydrogen bonds at the interfaces of neighboring fiber
cells in the subsequent mechanical pressing, which results in the
strong strength of the CBMs. When the cooking time increasing from
1 to 3 h and the lignin content decreasing from 27.3 ± 0.09 to
3.8 ± 0.05%, both the tensile strength and modulus show a gradually
growing trend (Figure 3b, Table 1). When
the cooking time reaches 3 h, the as-prepared CBM exhibits average
tensile strength and modulus of 719.0 ± 30.2 MPa and 19.0 ±
1.4 GPa, respectively. The result indicates that the increased numbers
of hydrogen bonds among adjacent fiber cells after lignin removal
primarily contributed to the full utilization of the exceptional mechanical
properties of CBMs. However, as the cooking time increased to 4 h,
the tensile stress and modulus of the as-prepared CBM begin to decline
as shown in Figure 3b,c. The decrease in mechanical properties of the CBM may be due
to the degradation of the cellulose.

Strong 2D submillimeter thick films and 1D microfibers
are two
types of CBMs that are widely reported in previous literature,4 which can limit their application in the fields
where strong and lightweight bulk materials are needed. In this section,
a facile and scalable layer-by-layer stacking approach was proposed
to fabricate anisotropic and isotropic bulk CBMs with superb mechanical
properties. Anisotropic bulk CBMs were fabricated by rationally stacking
anisotropic CBMs along the axial direction of the fiber and gluing
with 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution, as shown in Figure 4a, followed by hot pressing at a temperature of 50 °C
to accelerate drying. The upper images in Figure 4c show the anisotropic bulk CBMs with a dimension
of 5 × 3.5 × 0.7 cm3 that presented an ultimate
tensile stress of 561 MPa (Figure 4d).

Figure 4 Schematic to illustrate the fabrication of (a) anisotropic
and
(b) isotropic bulk CBMs and their corresponding digital photos (c)
and stress–strain curves (d).

Although anisotropic bulk CBMs exhibit excellent mechanical
properties
along the axial direction of the wood fiber, the tensile stress in
the direction perpendicular to the wood fiber alignment is only 30
MPa (Figure 3d), which
will restrict their uses in some areas that require excellent mechanical
properties in all directions. Therefore, we fabricated isotropic bulk
CBMs by stacking an anisotropic CBM with fiber alignment in the x direction, followed by the y direction
and gluing with 2% CMC solution. Finally, the sample was dried by
hot pressing at a temperature of 50 °C for 4 h. As a result,
the fiber alignment between adjacent anisotropic CBMs is perpendicular,
as shown in Figures 4b,c. The resulting isotropic bulk CBMs have a tensile stress and
a modulus of approximately 330 MPa and 15 GPa, respectively (Figure 4d).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate a strong CBM with highly aligned
wood fibers by a facile top-down method involving NaOH–AQ pulping
of the wood block and subsequent mechanical pressing. The as-prepared
CBM exhibits a record tensile strength as high as 773 MPa and a modulus
of up to 21.7 GPa. The strong strength of the resulting CBM was primarily
due to the good orientation of wood fibers in the longitudinal direction
as well as the increased numbers of hydrogen bonds among adjacent
fiber cells resulting from the lignin removal and mechanical pressing.
Moreover, anisotropic and isotropic bulk CBMs with exceptional mechanical
performance are successfully fabricated from aforementioned sheet-like
CBMs by a facile and scalable layer-by-layer stacking approach, which
show maximum strengths of 561 and 330 MPa, respectively. Such strong
yet lightweight CBM sheds light on fully exploiting the extraordinary
mechanical potential of the cellulose and has the potential to use
as high-performance engineering materials in the areas that are traditionally
dominated by artificial petroleum-based materials such as plastics,
concrete, and metals.

Experimental Section
Materials
Pine
wood (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) blocks with
a dimension of 100 × 35 × 3 mm3 were used in
this work. Sodium hydroxide (>96%) and anthraquinone (>98%)
were purchased
from Guangzhou Jinhuada chemical reagent Co., Ltd.

Fabrication
of CBMs
The delignification of wood blocks
was performed in a 1 L stainless autoclave reactor (Parr 4523, USA).
The delignification solution was prepared by dissolving sodium hydroxide
(20 g) and anthraquinone (0.05 g) in 600 mL deionized (DI) water.
The wood blocks and the delignification solution (wood/solution =
1:20) were added in the reactor and kept at 170 °C for 1, 2,
3, and 4 h, respectively. The delignified samples were then washed
with DI water several times to remove the residual black liquor.

The delignified wood blocks were covered with filter paper and pressed
with a hydraulic press at the pressure of 8 MPa for 3 h at room temperature.
During this process, the filter paper should be replaced at intervals
to ensure the removal of water in wood blocks. Finally, the delignified
samples were pressed at 90 °C for 3 min with 8 MPa to obtain
strong CBMs.

Characterizations
Microstructure
of strong CBMs and
wood blocks was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi
SU-70), and the cross-sections of the samples were cut with a Leica
EM TIC 3X argon ion cutter first. The mechanical properties were carried
out on an Instron 5565 universal tester using a 2 kN load cell. The
lignin contents were measured based on Technical Association of Pulp
and Paper Industry Standard Method T 222-om-83.
