A combined
biochemical, structural, and cell biology characterization
of dictyostatin is described, which enables an improved understanding
of the structural determinants responsible for the high-affinity binding
of this anticancer agent to the taxane site in microtubules (MTs).
The study reveals that this macrolide is highly optimized for MT binding
and that only a few of the structural modifications featured in a
library of synthetic analogues resulted in small gains in binding
affinity. The high efficiency of the dictyostatin chemotype in overcoming
various kinds of clinically relevant resistance mechanisms highlights
its potential for therapeutic development for the treatment of drug-resistant
tumors. A structural explanation is advanced to account for the synergy
observed between dictyostatin and taxanes on the basis of their differential
effects on the MT lattice. The X-ray crystal structure of a tubulin–dictyostatin
complex and additional molecular modeling have allowed the rationalization
of the structure–activity relationships for a set of synthetic
dictyostatin analogues, including the highly active hybrid 12 with discodermolide. Altogether, the work reported here is anticipated
to facilitate the improved design and synthesis of more efficacious
dictyostatin analogues and hybrids with other MT-stabilizing agents.

Introduction
Microtubule-stabilizing
agents (MSAs) are an important class of
clinically used anticancer drugs that target tubulin, the main component
of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton that is responsible for the segregation
of chromosomes during cell division, among other functions. MSAs inhibit
cell division by virtue of their preferential binding to assembled
MTs relative to unassembled αβ-tubulin heterodimers.1 Although the prototypical paclitaxel and docetaxel
have demonstrated great efficacy in inhibiting the growth of solid
tumors, solubility problems and development of resistance have stimulated
the search for other chemotypes with similar modes of action but improved
pharmacological profiles. The main mechanisms of resistance to MSAs
are (i) overexpression of βIII-tubulin isotypes and/or
membrane efflux transporters from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily,
for example, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is primarily responsible
for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype and (ii) mutations in
the β-tubulin gene.

This ongoing quest to identify new
chemotypes acting as MSAs has
resulted in the discovery of several other important antimitotic natural
products (e.g., epothilones, sarcodictyins, cyclostreptin, peloruside,
laulimalide, zampanolide, dictyostatin, and discodermolide) targeting
at least three different binding sites2 on β-tubulin but displaying similar biological activities.
Of these, the dictyostatin and discodermolide chemotypes, which are
complex marine sponge-derived polyketides, show the highest affinity
for MTs3 and have enhanced water solubility.
These two properties apparently make these MSAs more prone to circumventing
P-gp-mediated MDR because their high affinities for an abundant protein
should result in low intracellular concentrations of the free drug
and decreased interaction with the efflux transporter.

We have
previously shown that it is possible to structurally optimize
an MSA by studying the influence of selected chemical modifications
in critical pharmacophore regions and by combining into a single molecular
entity those changes that result in favorable contributions to the
binding free energy. This rational approach has been successfully
used to optimize the binding to the MTs of several epothilone4 and taxane analogues.5

Interest in the dictyostatin chemotype6 has driven the chemical synthesis of a variety of analogues to probe
the structural determinants of tubulin binding affinity, ability to
act as an MSA, and cytotoxic activity.7,8 We have used
a library of 16 structurally diverse compounds (Figure 1) arising from this synthetic effort to investigate
the following: (1) the influence of selected chemical modifications
on the tubulin binding constants, stoichiometry, and MT structural
properties using several biochemical and biophysical methods; (2)
the binding epitopes and bioactive conformations of these compounds
by means of X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling techniques;
and (3) their biological effects on a representative panel of tumor
cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to other MSAs. As
a long-term objective, this unified approach may lead to the rational
design of anticancer drug candidates with significantly increased
cytotoxicity and reduced resistance relative to the parent natural
product.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study.

In the present study, the structural modifications
encompass a
large part of the dictyostatin (1, Figure 1) scaffold, along with designed hybrids with
discodermolide (3).9−14 Although some limited information about the cytotoxicity of these
compounds in selected cancer cell lines has already been reported,
little is known about the details of their interactions with MTs and
tubulin, the contribution of the structural modifications to complex
formation, and the adoption of the bioactive conformation.

Extensive
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have been performed
to propose a bioactive conformation for dictyostatin and guide the
synthesis of new and simplified analogues (reviewed by Larsen et al.8). However, a crystal structure of dictyostatin,
either alone or in complex with tubulin, was not previously available
to enable the rational structure-based design of improved analogues.
To address this deficiency and help elucidate the pharmacophore region
of this important MSA, we solved the structure of the resultant T2R-TTL–dictyostatin complex at 2.3 Å resolution
using X-ray crystallography. We then simulated a macromolecular ensemble,
incorporating this experimentally determined protein–ligand
complex in the context of a reduced representation of a MT, using
molecular dynamics (MD). In silico evaluation of the modeled complexes
with the available synthetic dictyostatin analogues was then used
to rationalize the structure–activity relationships (SARs).
Taken together, these new results clarify the long-standing issue
of defining the pharmacophore for the dictyostatin chemotype and shed
additional light on longitudinal and lateral interactions in MSA-bound
tubulin. They also provide a powerful tool for the rational design
of simplified dictyostatin analogues and hybrids, including linker-modified
targeted versions for incorporation as payloads in antibody–drug
conjugates.

Results
Cytotoxicity of Dictyostatin and Analogues
in Resistant Cells
and Synergy with Paclitaxel and Peloruside A
To initially
explore the therapeutic potential of the dictyostatin chemotype as
an anticancer drug candidate, the cytotoxicities of the compounds
in Figure 1 were measured
in a panel of cancer cell lines that are resistant to other MSAs through
three different mechanisms. The synergistic effect of their combination
with either paclitaxel or peloruside A was also evaluated.

In
the A2780, A2780AD, and A549 cell lines, all compounds that were examined
arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, as expected
(Figure S1). In this regard, all of them,
with the exception of analogues 2 and 7,
were also shown to enhance tubulin polymerization in vitro in the
absence of MT-associated proteins (MAPS) and to reduce the critical
concentration (Cr) of tubulin required for assembly from 3.3 ±
0.1 μM in the absence of drug to 0.4 ± 0.1 μM in
the presence of parent dictyostatin (Table 1).

buffer.

The compounds were
evaluated in A2780 ovarian tumor cells and their
resistant A2780AD counterparts (Table 1). As previously shown,15 dictyostatin is active in this P-gp-overexpressing resistant cell
line. All of the compounds tested, including those incorporating hydrophobic
side chains, were found to be able to overcome P-gp-mediated resistance.
The finding that all of the compounds show resistance indices between
0.5 and 3.9 (for 11) indicates that they are not substrates
for this membrane drug efflux pump. Evaluation against HeLa-S3 and
HeLa-βIII cervical tumor cells, the latter resistant
to paclitaxel through overexpression of the βIII isotype
of tubulin, also showed that all of the compounds in the library were
equally active against these two cell lines (Table 1).

Finally, the compounds were assayed
in paclitaxel-resistant PTX-10
and PTX-22 ovarian cancer cells harboring β-tubulin variants
F272V and A366T, respectively, and epothilone-resistant A8 cells containing
the β-tubulin variant T276I (Table S1). Most of the compounds were not affected by the F272V mutation,
as shown by much lower R/S indices than that of paclitaxel (R/S =
37), although high values were obtained for 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14. By contrast, only 11 and 14 showed
R/S indices 3 times lower than that of paclitaxel in cells expressing
A366T β-tubulin. Furthermore, A8 cells harboring T276I β-tubulin
did not show resistance to any of the compounds tested. As anticipated
from earlier work,12 the synthetic hybrid
12 of dictyostatin with discodermolide was generally more potent (low
or sub-nanomolar) in the cell lines tested than either natural product
itself.

Previous studies had indicated that although discodermolide
and
paclitaxel share the same binding site on β-tubulin, their combination
is synergistic in tumor cell lines16−18 and in xenograft tumor-implanted
animals.19 All of the compounds tested,
with the exception of 10, were shown to act synergistically
with paclitaxel (Table S2), as previously
observed for discodermolide16,17,20 and two other analogues.18 Significantly,
when peloruside A, an MSA targeting a different binding site on β-tubulin,21 was used in the same cell line in place of paclitaxel,
the synergy was only observed at low ligand concentrations, and none
was observed with 12 (Table S2).

Morphological Effects of the Compounds on the Cell Cytoskeleton
The effect of the compounds on the cell cytoskeleton was evaluated
in human lung carcinoma A549 cells at different ligand concentrations
(Figure 2). The immunofluorescence
experiments show that the analogues potently induce the emergence
of abnormal MT bundles, as for the parent compounds dictyostatin and
discodermolide, and also for paclitaxel, but with some differences
in the morphology. In the case of taxanes, the bundles are long and
thin, whereas in the case of the compounds tested here, they are shorter
and thicker. Nonetheless, all compounds induced a somewhat parallel
alignment of MTs (straighter MTs) in the absence of MT bundles, in
contrast to the organized MT network that was observed in the untreated
(DMSO) cells. Dictyostatin and 12 were especially potent
in inducing MT bundles, already apparent at concentrations of ∼50
nM, as well as discodermolide, 6, and 9,
for which this effect was visible at concentrations similar to those
of paclitaxel (100 nM). Compounds 4, 5,
and 8 required concentrations of ∼250 nM, whereas
the other compounds assayed (e.g., 11, 13, 14, and 15) were significantly less active,
requiring μM concentrations to induce the MT bundles.

compounds on the MT network and the nuclear morphology

the mitotic spindle, and the nuclear morphology of A549 cells in comparison
with untreated cells (DMSO), cells treated with paclitaxel, and the
reference parent compounds dictyostatin and discodermolide. Cells
were incubated for 24 h in the presence of DMSO (A, A′), paclitaxel
100 nM (B, B′), dictyostatin 50 nM (C, C′), discodermolide
100 nM (D, D′), 4 250 nM (E, E′), 5 200 nM (F, F′), 6 100 nM (G, G′), 8 200 nM (H, H′), 9 100 nM (I, I′), 10 800 nM (J, J′), 11 2 μM (K, K′), 12 60 nM (L, L′), 13 1.8 μM (M,
M′), 14 6 μM (N, N′), and 15 8 μM (O, O′). MTs (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,
L, M, N, and O) are labeled with the DM1A antibody against α-tubulin,
whereas DNA (A′, B′, C′, D′, E′,
F′, G′, H′, I′, J′, K′,
L′, M′, N′, and O′) is marked with Hoechst
33342. The insets (A, A′, B, B′, C, C′, the latest
representative for all ligands examined) show the mitotic spindles
in the same preparations. The bar at O′ represents 10 μm,
with all panels showing the same magnification.

Another morphological difference observed was the presence
of a
large number of micronucleated cells, multipolar mitotic spindles,
and multiple asters (Figure 2).

Affinity of the Compounds for the Taxane-Binding
Site
The binding of the compounds to the paclitaxel site
in the MTs was
tested using the displacement of the bona fide fluorescent paclitaxel
analogue Flutax-24,5 (Table 2). Because 4, 6, 9, and 12 completely displaced Flutax-2
at equimolar concentrations, we also carried out a direct competition
experiment with epothilone B (binding affinity = 7.5 × 108 M–1 at 35 °C) (Table 2) to measure their high binding affinities
more accurately.22

Effects of the Compounds on the MT Structure
The effect
of the compounds on the MT structure was studied using small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS), which allows the measurement of the average
number of protofilaments of the induced MTs, as determined by the
lateral contacts between adjacent tubulin dimers.23 The largest effect was exerted by dictyostatin and discodermolide,
which induced 14.5 ± 0.3 protofilament MTs, whereas the number
of protofilaments in the presence of analogues 5, 6, and 11 (13.7 ± 0.1, 13.5 ± 0.3,
and 13.2 ± 0.5, respectively) was similar to that observed in
the absence of drug (13.6 protofilaments).24 This number was even smaller in the presence of dictyostatin–discodermolide
hybrids 12, 14, and 15 (13.2
± 1, 13.1 ± 0.2, and 12.9 ± 0.3, respectively).

Crystal
Structure of the T2R-TTL–Dictyostatin
Complex
The X-ray crystal structure of the dictyostatin-bound
tubulin was determined to 2.3 Å resolution and is shown in Figure 3. As expected, dictyostatin
occupies the taxane-binding site on β-tubulin, and in agreement
with previous proposals,25,26 its C19-hydroxyl forms
two hydrogen bonds with both the main chain carbonyl of Pro274 and
the main chain amide of Thr276. This central anchoring point is equivalent
to that of the oxetane oxygen in paclitaxel27 and that of the carbonyl C1–O in epothilone A.28 Two additional hydrogen bonds are formed by
the hydroxyls at C7 and C13 in dictyostatin to the side chains of
His229 and Asp226, respectively. The interaction at C13 of dictyostatin
is equivalent to the C7–OH–Asp226 interaction observed
in the tubulin–epothilone A complex.28 The methyl substituent of the Thr276 side chain is in hydrophobic
contact with the C22 methyl group of dictyostatin, whereas the hydroxyl
substituent on the amino acid residue is not involved in the recognition
of the ligand. This observation satisfactorily accounts for the resilience
of dictyostatin to the T276I mutation, which severely compromises
binding of the epothilone chemotype. Furthermore, the olefins at C3
and C25 form two weak C=O···HC= hydrogen
bonds30 to the main chain carbonyls of
Gly370 and Thr276, respectively. The dictyostatin–tubulin binding
arrangement is completed by a cation−π interaction between
the olefinic C23–C26 moiety and the guanidinium of Arg278 in
the M-loop, and by van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with
Leu217, Leu230, Ala233, Phe272, Leu275, and Leu371 (Figure 3A,B), distinct from most of
the epothilone contacts (Figure 3C). Notably, the F272V replacement does not affect
the binding affinity of dictyostatin, although it has a strongly deleterious
effect for some of its analogues, for example, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16 (Table 2).

of the tubulin–dictyostatin (yellow sticks, light gray ribbon)
and tubulin–epothilone A (violet-purple sticks and ribbon)
structures. Hydrogen bonds of the tubulin–dictyostatin complex
are highlighted as dashed black lines.

Arguably, the most novel and striking feature of the T2R-TTL–dictyostatin complex reported here is the presence
of
two (=CH···O=) hydrogen bonds involving
the olefinic carbons at C3 and C25 and the carbonyl oxygens of Gly370
and Thr276, respectively. This type of interaction is considered weaker
in energy30 than the other hydrogen bonds
described above but nonetheless appears to be significant for proper
ligand orientation and stabilization within the binding site.

The tubulin-bound conformation of dictyostatin in this complex
is remarkably similar to both the solid state (deposited in the Cambridge
Structural Database with code Vintan0131) and solution32 structures of its closest
MSA relative, discodermolide. Furthermore, this same conformation
is also observed in an independently solved structure of discodermolide
bound to the T2R-TTL complex (Figure S2). This is particularly noteworthy in view of the ∼30
times greater binding affinity of discodermolide for this β-tubulin
site compared with that of its 22-membered macrolide relative, dictyostatin3 and the fact that the entropic contribution to
binding is more favorable for discodermolide, which argues against
a loss of conformational freedom for this compound upon binding.

Simulation of Dictyostatin Binding to a Reduced Representation
of an MT
The importance of studying the binding of an MSA
in the context of a realistic representation of an MT34 led us to expand the size of our previous tubulin model
system beyond that of a simple dimer.35 A short MT stretch was built by taking two α1-β1-α2 segments from two vicinal protofilaments34 and incorporating one bound drug molecule (either
dictyostatin or epothilone A were used here for comparative purposes)
into each central β-tubulin subunit28 (see Experimental Procedures). The conformational
stability of each of these assemblies, in which both M-loops are structurally
ordered as α-helices at the beginning, was then examined by
means of unrestrained MD simulations in an explicit aqueous solvent.
By using this computational protocol, two distinct MSA-binding sites
could be monitored in parallel: site 1, at the interface between two
neighboring protofilaments and site 2, devoid of any protein lateral
contacts but exposed to the bulk solvent (Figure S3). Because no major differences are found in the binding
site between the straight and curved conformation,28 the large differences in the binding affinity that are
consistently observed experimentally between the unassembled and assembled
tubulin must reflect the relevance of the lateral contacts for the
binding.

When the T2R-TTL–dictyostatin complex
was simulated in the context of our reduced representation of a MT,
the hydrogen bonds initially present between OG1(Thr276) and both
NE2(Gln281) and NH1(Arg284) could not be stabilized by the bound ligand
(Figure 4), unlike
the situation observed in the epothilone A complex28,35 and (Figure S4). This is a direct consequence
of the lack of pharmacophore interactions in dictyostatin equivalent
to those involving the side-chain thiazole ring nitrogen and the C3–OH
group attached to the macrocycle in epothilone A (Figure 3C). Instead, transient hydrogen
bonds were observed between NE2(Gln281) and the lactone carbonyl oxygen
of dictyostatin and also between NH1(Arg284) and the Asp90 carboxylate
of the neighboring β1 subunit (Figure 4). The weak O(Thr276)–C25 hydrogen
bond was the most affected in the absence of neighboring protofilaments
(site 2). By contrast, the hydrogen bond between OD1/OD2(Asp226) and
OH at C13 was reinforced in both sites for the full duration of the
simulation and that established between NE2(His229) and the hydroxyl
at C7 was maintained during most of the simulated trajectory. The
structural rearrangements of the M-loops were more noticeable in the
tubulin complex with dictyostatin relative to that with epothilone
A, and also in site 2 relative to site 1, as expected from the larger
solvent exposure of the former.

Discussion
In 2001, discodermolide entered phase I
clinical trials as an anticancer
drug candidate, with Novartis.36 However,
it did not advance into phase II because of unexpected lung toxicity.37 Until now, no other MSA belonging to either
the discodermolide or dictyostatin chemotypes has entered clinical
trials despite the high affinity of these compounds for tubulin,3 as well as their potent cytotoxicity and ability
to overcome P-gp-mediated MDR.5 Nevertheless,
these promising biological attributes have inspired us to further
study the dictyostatin chemotype to identify the structural determinants
responsible for their high binding affinities and their potent effects
in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.

SARs for the Dictyostatin
Analogues
Out of all analogues
of dictyostatin that we examined (the open-chain discodermolide notwithstanding),
only 4, 6, 9, and 12 showed a greater affinity for tubulin than the parent compound (Table 2) indicating that,
in contrast to paclitaxel and epothilones,4,5 dictyostatin
is highly optimized for binding to MTs, and there is scope to prepare
even more efficacious analogues based on the further evolution and
optimization of this novel macrocyclic scaffold.

Our modeling
studies provide a rationale for these findings and for some earlier
SAR results.38 Thus, the dramatic loss
of affinity found for the ring-contracted analogue 2 and
similar 20-membered macrolides resulting from C21 to C19 translactonization14 is a direct consequence of the pronounced conformational
changes relative to that in dictyostatin (Figure 5A) to the extent that the pharmacophore hotspots
essential for a strong tubulin binding are missing altogether. Removal
of the methyl group at C6, as in analogue 4,14 is likely to introduce some additional conformational
flexibility in the macrocycle, leading to an improved interaction
between the C1–C5 conjugated dienoate system and the Gly370
backbone, which is reflected in a gain in the free energy of binding
of −2.7 kJ mol–1. By contrast, removal of
the methyl group at C16, as in analogue 10, results in
a weaker binding (ΔΔG +9.1 kJ mol–1), most likely due to the loss of favorable interactions
with the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Leu230, Ala233,
Phe272, and Leu275, as anticipated from the previous modeling work.39 Replacement of the hydroxyl group at C9 with
a methoxy group (as found in the highest-affinity compound 9) probably shields the hydrogen bond between OH at C7 of dictyostatin
and NE2(His229) from disrupting the interactions with water molecules
(ΔΔG −4.6 kJ mol–1). However, epimerization at C9,15 as
featured in both 7 and 11, disturbs the
interaction involving OH at C7 and promotes conformational changes
in the macrocycle that preclude an optimum fit into the binding site
and translate into considerable losses of affinity (ΔΔG +5.3 and +10.8 kJ mol–1). Selective
hydrogenation of the C2–C3 double bond in 6 slightly
increases the binding affinity (ΔΔG −1.4
kJ mol–1), whereas hydrogenation of both C2–C3
and C4–C5 double bonds in 8(14) increases the flexibility of the macrocycle and leads to
a lower affinity for tubulin (ΔΔG +6.1
kJ mol–1). By contrast, introduction of a trisubstituted
double bond at C15–C16, together with additional methylation
at C18 so as to incorporate some of the structural features present
in discodermolide,40 yields the most cytotoxic
hybrid compound 12, which possibly owes its higher affinity
to increased van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Leu217
and Leu230. Nevertheless, other hybrids such as 13, 14, and 16, or more sophisticated constructs
merging features from dictyostatin, discodermolide, and taxanes, such
as 14 and 17, have considerably less affinity
than the parent compound, essentially because the extra substituents
are not properly oriented to improve the fit into the taxane-binding
site of β-tubulin (Figure 5B).

Figure 5 Comparison between the predicted structures of the analogues.

structure conformation of dictyostatin (dictyostatin, C atoms colored

compounds 4–16 bound to the taxane-binding
site of β-tubulin. The very weak binder isodictyostatin (2) and hybrid 14, which incorporates a fragment
derived from docetaxel, are not shown.

Furthermore, this bound conformation also accounts for SAR
results
recently reported for some other active dictyostatin analogues41 designed as putative payloads for antibody–drug
conjugates. By inspection of the tubulin-bound conformation, it is
apparent that the C6 methyl group of dictyostatin is located deep
in the binding pocket, such that a functionalized alkyl linker placed
at this position will extend toward H1 or point inside of the binding
pocket and occupy the space that is otherwise filled by the C13 side
chain of paclitaxel (Figure S5A,B). By
contrast, inclusion of a functionalized alkyl linker in place of the
C12 methyl group will cause full exposure of this group to the solvent,
and the flexible linker may perturb the interaction of the ligand
by interfering with the elements surrounding the binding site (Figure S5C).

Comparison of Epothilone
A and Dictyostatin Chemotypes
When the β1 subunits of [epothilone A:(α1-β1-α2)]2 and
[dictyostatin:(α1-β1-α2)]2 complexes were best-fit superimposed (Figure S6), these two MSAs were revealed to share
only two anchoring points that involved hydrogen bonds (Table S3), namely, the carboxylate of Asp226
(OH at C3 of epothilone A vs OH at C13 of dictyostatin) and the backbone
amide nitrogen of Thr276 (O1 of epothilone A vs OH at C19 of dictyostatin).
Notably, only the latter interaction is shared with paclitaxel (PDB
entry 1JFF),27 the prototypical MSA that
engages its oxetane oxygen in a hydrogen bond. In the case of dictyostatin,
the strength of this anchoring point is augmented because the OH group
at C19 simultaneously donates a hydrogen bond to O(Pro274). This common
polar pharmacophore is complemented by distinct van der Waals interactions
involving the side chains of His229 and a number of hydrophobic residues
(Figure 3B).

A unique structural feature of dictyostatin relative to other MSAs
is the presence of two conjugated diene regions that give rise to
two weak C=O···HC= hydrogen bonds30 involving the olefinic carbons at C3 and C25
on the one side and the backbone carbonyl groups of Gly370 and Thr276
on the other side (Figure 3B). These distinctive interactions are maintained throughout
the MD simulations. In addition, the alkene at C2–C3 in dictyostatin
interacts with the hydrophobic side chain of Leu371, whereas the C22–C26
conjugated diene system can establish a stabilizing π–cation
interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg278.

In summary,
dictyostatin makes use of some common binding hotspots
on the tubulin protein employed by epothilone A (Asp226, His229, Phe272,
Thr276, and Arg278) in a way that is compatible with maintaining an
α-helical conformation of the M-loop, even though this is not
present in the crystal structure. Nonetheless, the Thr276 and Gln281
side chains of this structural element are found to be more disordered
because of the lack of highly directional hydrogen-bonding interactions
with the bound ligand.

Compounds of the Dictyostatin Chemotype are
Effective in All
Types of Taxane-Resistant Cells
From a potential therapeutic
standpoint, another remarkable property of the synthetic analogues
based on the dictyostatin chemotype is their pronounced ability to
overcome all kinds of known resistance mechanisms related to tubulin-targeting
anticancer drugs (i.e., P-gp overexpression, mutations in their binding
site, and expression of the βIII tubulin isotype).

Significantly, the dictyostatin chemotype shows potent (low nanomolar)
activity (Table 1)
against P-gp-overexpressing resistant cells (A2780AD), independent
of the binding affinity. This effect is probably not related to the
competition between the target and the drug efflux pump, as is the
case for other high-affinity tubulin modulators,5,42 but
is likely due to a low affinity for the pump, which prefers compounds
with high lipophilicity (e.g., uncharged and possessing aromatic rings).43

With respect to the resistant cell lines
harboring mutations, the
relative efficacy depends on the compound tested (Table S1). Although most of the analogues tested are not affected
by the F272V mutation, as shown by R/S indices much lower than that
for paclitaxel (R/S = 37), the high values obtained for a few of them,
namely, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14, suggest that intraprotein
or ligand–protein interactions involving this aromatic residue
are highly sensitive to relatively subtle conformational changes in
the macrocycle and/or particular variations in the side chain replacement.
By contrast, the finding that only 11 and 14 show R/S indices around 4.0 (i.e., three times lower than that of
paclitaxel) in cells expressing the A366T β-tubulin variant
indicates a much smaller influence of this residue on the binding
of this chemotype, which is in agreement with the present modeling
studies. Likewise, the observation that A8 cells harboring T276I β-tubulin
do not show resistance to any of the compounds tested concurs with
the lack of direct interactions of dictyostatin and its analogues
with the side chain hydroxyl of this amino acid residue, as was also
found for paclitaxel. Finally, the finding that the side chain of
Ser277 in the tubulin/dictyostatin complexes is directed away from
the bound ligand (as is the case for the tubulin/epothilone complexes28) satisfactorily accounts for the fact that the
resistant cells overexpressing the βIII isotype are
equally sensitive to these MSA chemotypes.44

Synergy between Paclitaxel and Dictyostatin Chemotypes
The
results obtained in this study (Table S2) are in accordance with the previous observation that although discodermolide
and paclitaxel share the same tubulin-binding site, their combination
is synergistic in both tumor cell cultures16−18 and tumor-implanted
animals.19

Such a synergy has also
been described between paclitaxel and laulimalide or peloruside A,45−47 which are MSAs targeting a different binding site. A crosstalk between
the laulimalide/peloruside and taxane sites via the M-loop of β-tubulin
has been advanced as an explanation for this synergy, which is based
on comparing the conformation of the Gln294–Phe296 segment
in the presence and absence of bound drugs because it adopts a helical,
polymerization-competent, MT-stabilizing “on-state”
or a turn-type III, “off-state”.21 However, this kind of mechanism would not be possible for
compounds that share a common binding site.

However, this mechanism
implies that a single tubulin molecule
should be ligated by both ligands to experience this synergy, and
this is not the case. It is important to realize that both the synergies
between paclitaxel and dictyostatin and between paclitaxel-site and
laulimalide-site ligands in the inhibition of cell proliferation occur
at low nanomolar drug concentrations, far below those needed to bind
tubulin stoichiometrically within the cell. At such low nanomolar
IC50 values, the percentage of tubulin bound by either
a paclitaxel-site or a laulimalide-site ligand is in the range of
2–5% of all of the available proteins.5 Considering that binding to the paclitaxel and the laulimalide sites
is independent (binding of laulimalide does not significantly modify
the binding affinity of the taxane-site ligand48), these figures imply that the probability that a single
tubulin protein is bound by both taxane-site and laulimalide-site
ligands is between 0.04 and 0.25%. This makes it unlikely that an
individual tubulin protein has both taxane and laulimalide molecules
simultaneously bound to it. Thus, both in the taxane-site/laulimalide
site and in the dictyostatin and taxane chemotypes, the observed synergy
should be attributed to the interdimer effects caused by cooperativity
of their differential effects when bound at different tubulins of
the same MT lattice as opposed to an intradimer effect.

Effects on
the MT Structure
In contrast to what would
be expected from consideration of an earlier model for a binding pose
for discodermolide25 far from the M-loop,
a significant effect of both dictyostatin and discodermolide was observed
here on the MT protofilament number. Because these two MSAs induce
14.5 ± 0.1 protofilament MTs, they must exert a strong influence
on the interprotofilament lateral interactions that stabilize the
MTs. Interestingly, this influence has the opposite effect to that
resulting from paclitaxel binding, which reduces this number.24 Reduction in the protofilament number arises
from a smaller interprotofilament angle and vice versa. The fact that
these two opposite effects can take place in different β-tubulin
subunits within the same MT provides a possible structural explanation
for the synergistic effect observed.

Intriguingly, the number
of protofilaments does not change in the MTs stabilized by epothilone
A, an MSA for which the M-loop appears structurally defined as an
α-helix in the X-ray tubulin–ligand complexes.21,28 This M-loop conformation, which is also observed in the complex
with zampanolide,28 correlates with the
conformation observed in the MTs,34 despite
the fact that the (α1-β1:α2-β2) tetramer in the T2R-TTL–ligand
complexes is bent and most of the M-loop is solvent exposed. The interprotofilament
lateral interactions are present, however, in our modeled [dictyostatin/(α1-β1-α2)]2 and
[epothilone A/(α1-β1-α2)]2 complexes, and some of the features observed
can be important to account for the stabilization of the lateral contacts
brought about by drug binding beyond the well-established role of
the side chain of Tyr283 in the M-loop:34 first, the stabilizing role of the water molecule that bridges a
hydrogen-bonding interaction between the main chain NH(Arg278) at
the plus end of the M-loop’s helical dipole and the backbone
O(Leu217); second, a hydrogen bond between O(Tyr283) at the minus
end of the M-loop helix and NH(Arg88) in the neighboring β-tubulin
subunit; third, another hydrogen bond between O(Gln282) in the M-loop
and NH(Ala57) in the 56–59 twisted β-hairpin of the neighboring
β-tubulin subunit; and finally, NH of Arg284 at the minus end
of the M-loop helix is engaged in a hydrogen bond with O(Ser280) within
the helix, whereas its carbonyl oxygen is exposed to the solvent and
its guanidinium side chain is extended to allow the establishment
of multiple electrostatic interactions with the carboxamide oxygen
of Gln294, the hydroxyl of Thr276, and the carboxylate of Glu290.

Altogether, we believe that the network of interactions just described
is sensitive to the presence of a bound ligand in the taxane-binding
site in such a way that the spatial relation between the M-loop (R278GSQQY283) in one β-tubulin subunit and
the twisted β-hairpin (Y53NEAA̲G̲NKYV62) of the β-subunit in the neighboring protofilaments
changes slightly but sufficiently to act as a wedge that can either
increase or decrease the interprotofilament angle and thereby lead
to MTs with a higher or lower number of protofilaments. An important
exception is epothilone A that binds to MTs without affecting their
overall structure most likely because its rather unique set of interactions
gives rise to stabilization of the side chains of Thr276 and Gln281.
Additional work is in progress to provide further support for this
hypothesis.

of Cambridge, 2005), discodermolide,52 (4, 6, 8),14 (5),13 (7, 9, 10, 11),10 (12),12 (13),53 (14),54 and (15, 16).11

The ring-contracted analogue 2 was separated
from
residual dictyostatin before each experiment using a depletion method.
A sample of 2 in the desired buffer was incubated for
30 min at 25 °C with a 5% molar ratio of stabilized MTs. The
stabilized MTs were then removed by pelleting in a TLA 100.2 rotor
at 50 000 rpm for 20 min in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge.

Biochemical Characterization
The binding constants
of the compounds to stabilized MTs were measured as previously described.5 The Cr of the tubulin assembly in the presence
of compounds in the GAB buffer (3.4 M glycerol, 10 mM sodium phosphate
(NaPi), 1 mM EGTA, 6 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM GTP, pH 6.7) was
measured as reported earlier.3

Crystallization,
Data Collection, and Structure Solution
Crystals of T2R-TTL were grown as previously described,28,55 except that tubulin was not subjected to a cycle of polymerization/depolymerization
before complex assembly and crystallization. Crystals were soaked
overnight in a reservoir solution (10% PEG 4K, 16% glycerol, 30 mM
CaCl2, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M MES/imidazole pH 6.7,
1 mM AmPPcP, 10 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM GDP) supplemented with 1 mM dictyostatin
and were collected directly from the drop and flash-cooled in liquid
nitrogen. Data collection at beamline X06DA at the Swiss Light Source
(Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland) and data processing
and structure solution were performed as previously described.55 Details of the data collection and refinement
statistics are given in Table S4.

The chains in the T2R-TTL–dictyostatin complex
are defined as follows: chain A, α1-tubulin; chain
B, β1-tubulin; chain C, α2-tubulin;
chain D, β2-tubulin; chain E, RB3; and chain F, TTL.
Chain D was used throughout for the structural analysis and figure
preparation. Structure visualization, molecular editing, and figure
preparation were performed with PyMOL (the PyMOL molecular graphics
system, version 1.5.0.5. Schrödinger, LLC). The atomic coordinates
and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(www.rcsb.org) under accession
code 5MF4 (T2R-TTL–dictyostatin).
