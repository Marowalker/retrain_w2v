We report a methodology to encapsulate
gold nanorods (AuNRs) and
gold bipyramids (AuBPs) into polyelectrolyte capsules for catalytic
application. Microreactors (capsules with encapsulated NRs or BPs)
were fabricated by sequential deposition of poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
and dextran sulfate on modified sacrificial template, followed by
core dissolution. AuNRs and AuBPs of size 25–30 nm were successfully
encapsulated in the fabricated polyelectrolyte capsules and were stable
and distributed uniformly in the interior. Fabricated microreactors
were investigated as catalysts for the reduction of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol in the presence of
sodium borohydride in aqueous phase. Reaction parameters such as order,
conversion, and rate constants were estimated for microreactors and
compared to free anisotropic nanoparticles in suspension. The reaction
rate was higher for NRs in both free and capsule forms compared to
BPs. Microreactors demonstrated excellent catalytic activity even
after three times of use. Such capsules have high potential for use
as microreactors in applications such as catalysis, drug delivery,
imaging, and cancer chemo-photothermal therapy.

1 Introduction
In the past two decades,
polymeric hollow capsules have shown great
promise in the fields of catalysis, sensing, and drug delivery because
of their ability to provide stable and well-dispersed colloidal microcarrier
system. The unique features such as high encapsulation efficiency
for biomolecules, selective permeability for the reactants, confined
space for the interaction of reactants, easier separation of formed
products, and possibility for surface modification make them a potential
candidate for various applications.1−3 Several strategies are
being explored to fabricate polymeric capsules with novel architecture
that can provide unique option to manipulate the capsule permeability
and space to accommodate molecules in the inner cavity. Smart nanofactories,4 polymersomes, dendrimers, micelles, stimuli-responsive
nanocarriers,5 artificial organelles,6 artificial cells,7 and other systems have successfully been reported for the fabrication
of nano-microreactors for different biological applications.8 Among the different methods reported for hollow
capsule fabrication, the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly owes its popularity
to the fact that it provides access to near-perfect, ultrathin polymeric
shell on the one hand while allowing precise tailoring of shell properties
such as permeability, thickness, and composition on the other hand.9−11 Interestingly, LbL-assembled capsules provide option to tune permeability
based on our requirements. For instance, the shell permeability of
the capsules can be reversibly tuned from open to closed states by
varying environmental parameters such as pH, temperature, polarity,
and ionic strength.12−15 When burst release is needed, capsules can also be ruptured irreversibly
by exposing to external triggers such as laser light, ultrasound,
and magnetic field.16−19 Successful encapsulation of various macromolecules (e.g., enzymes,
proteins, genes, amino acids, and other bioactive materials), pharmaceutical
drugs, and nanoparticles (NPs) into polyelectrolyte capsules has been
reported by using them as micro- and nanocontainers.1,20

NPs, especially gold NPs, are preferred for several chemical
oxidation
and reduction reactions compared to their counterpart bulk gold, owing
to their high surface-to-volume ratios and unique physical and chemical
properties.21 They have been widely used
as catalysts for several oxidation and hydrogenation reactions, carbon–carbon
coupling reactions such as homocoupling of halides and organoboronates,
and A3 coupling reactions of amines, phenylacetylenes, and aldehydes.22 With the emergence of novel methodologies to
synthesize gold anisotropic nanoparticles (ANPs) (gold nanorods (AuNRs),
gold bipyramids (AuBPs), gold nanoprisms, etc.), several reports have
demonstrated their excellent catalytic properties. For instance, higher
rate constant and lower conversion time were observed for the conversion
of p-nitrophenol (PNP) to p-aminophenol
(PAP) using NaBH4 catalyzed by AuNRs with an aspect ratio
of 3.3 (length, 40 nm; diameter, 12 nm) compared to spherical nanospheres
of size 20 nm.23 Interestingly, the conversion
is largely dependent on the size of spherical ANPs. When larger spherical
NPs (40 nm) and smaller ANPs (aspect ratio, 2.8) were used for same
catalytic reaction, complete conversion was achieved within 64 min
for spherical NPs.24 However, it took 118
min for AuNRs and 87 min for gold nanoprisms. As nanoprisms have more
well-defined edges and corners compared to AuNRs, they provided more
catalytic sites for the conversion of PNP to PAP and resulted in high
rate of reaction. It should also be noted that there are inconsistencies
in the results found in the literature, which is probably due to different
masses of catalysts used for experiments. Furthermore, gold nanoantennas
with shorter protrusions displayed higher rate constant for PNP to
PAP conversion compared to longer protrusions owing to the more efficient
PNP adsorption on its surfaces.25 Another
important factor that alters the reaction rate is the effect of spatial
orientation and packing pattern of the particles.26 In all cases, the number of particles was kept constant
by applying different ways such as maintaining the same amount of
gold salts for NP synthesis or the weight of the particles. However,
the methodologies mentioned above assume that the conversion is uniform, which
is  not true. Hence, a detailed investigation is necessary
to estimate the rate constants by including the PNP concentration
and the number of ANPs used for the conversion. Alternatively, the
amount of catalyst NPs required to convert 1 unit mole of PNP along
with rate constants might provide better information on the effectiveness
of catalyst NPs. Furthermore, issues such as aggregation of NPs, separation
of catalyst NPs after reaction, and nonreusability limit their potential
and pose an open question in applicability of ANPs in catalysis.

Novel methods are being explored to encapsulate ANPs into the hollow
capsules as it enhances their regulation and reusability as catalysts.
Further, separation of catalyst NPs is easier and cost-effective when
they are used in encapsulated form (microreactors). Hollow capsules
with encapsulated NRs are demonstrated for cancer therapy, biological
imaging, and theranostics.27,28 Some of these strategies
follow the growth of NPs on the polymer shell, while others follow
the growth of ANPs inside the capsule via either in situ growth of NRs in the core before polymer deposition or modification
of template using preformed NRs. However, only few reports have successfully
presented the latter, and the yield of NRs observed was also very
minimal.29 Furthermore, only NRs were reported
by using the above-mentioned methodologies. In the perspective of
catalysis, the lower amount of encapsulation of NRs (yield) might
significantly affect the conversion of reactants into products. When
microcapsules of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PSS) containing spherical silver NPs in their shell were used for
the reduction of PNP to PAP, 100% conversion was achieved after 12
h and the reaction rate was much lower as direct surface of the particles
was not exposed for reaction.30 Interestingly,
the progress of the reaction can be stopped by increasing the number
of bilayers to eight as it prevents the contact of catalysts and reactants.
Similarly, a comparative study of NPs in encapsulated and free forms
demonstrated lower catalytic activity for the former during the reduction
of hexacyanoferrate(III) by borohydride ions.31 The advantage of encapsulated system is that it provides the space
and ability for further modification with other molecules or NPs (e.g.,
magnetic NPs) that could enable easy separation of catalysts at the
end of reaction using magnetic separation. Microcages made of silver
NPs showed excellent catalytic activity for the epoxidation of higher
olefins even after four successive uses.32 Hairy hybrid nanorattle polymer shell containing platinum NPs was
used as nanocatalyst for pseudo-first-order kinetic reduction of PNP.33 The rate of reduction increased as a function
of temperature. The catalyst recovery was easy after completion of
the reaction along with excellent reusability even after three times
of use with no loss in efficiency. Polymer capsules of poly(ionic
liquid) and poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) containing
AuNPs were also shown to catalyze the conversion of PNP to PAP. Notably,
the rate of reaction increased continuously until the reaction temperature
reached lower critical solution temperature of PDMAEMA at 50 °C.34 The catalyst showed excellent reusability with
slightly decreased reaction conversion after running for five cycles.

It is important to note that microcapsules encapsulated with spherical
NPs are widely explored, but there are no reports on ANPs encapsulated
in micro- or nanocapsules for catalysis applications. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report on encapsulation of ANPs
into hollow polyelectrolyte capsules for catalysis application. In
this work, we have fabricated PAH/dextran sulfate (DS) microcapsules
loaded with AuNRs/AuBPs in the interior of the hollow structure via
modified core template method. The sacrificial template was prepared
by adding preformed AuNRs or AuBPs during the synthesis of CaCO3 microparticles. The present method shows excellent distribution
and encapsulation of NRs/BPs in the interior of the capsules. Fabricated
microreactors and free ANPs were investigated using UVvisible (UV–vis) spectroscopy
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These microcapsules were
investigated for catalytic conversion of PNP to PAP in aqueous phase
with NaBH4. Reaction parameters such as order, rate constants,
and conversion time were estimated for microreactors and compared
with ANPs in suspension.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication of ANPs and Microreactor Capsules
For the
fabrication of microreactors, NRs or BPs of 25–30
nm in length were prepared by seed-mediated approach and incorporated
into sacrificial CaCO3 template prior to LbL assembly process.
By using this modified CaCO3 particles as sacrificial template,
hollow capsules (microreactors) were prepared by sequential deposition
of PAH and DS, followed by core dissolution with 0.2 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution. NRs and BPs were chosen for catalytic experiments
as they can be synthesized via seed-mediated method using cetyl trimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) as a stabilizing agent. Furthermore, previous reports
demonstrated that the presence of CTAB on the surface of NPs did not
affect their catalytic activity. For instance, 100% catalytic activity
was achieved in 64 and 120 min for CTAB-stabilized positively charged
gold nanospheres of diameter 45 ± 5 nm and NRs of aspect ratio
2.8 ± 0.2, respectively.24

A
two-step synthesis method was adopted to synthesize NRs and BPs. Initially,
seed crystals of size ∼4 nm were prepared by reducing HAuCl4 using strong reducing agent NaBH4 in the presence
of CTAB or trisodium citrate. The seed crystals were then allowed
to grow into NRs or BPs by controlling their growth via modulating
the concentrations of AgNO3, shape-directing agent (CTAB),
and weak reducing agent ascorbic acid (AA). The formation of
NRs and BPs was investigated using UV–vis spectroscopy and
TEM. Notably, UV–vis spectrum of seed crystals showed a characteristic
absorption band for gold NPs at 475 nm (Figure 1). AuNR spectrum showed two new peaks at
513 and 673 nm, which correspond to transverse and longitudinal bands
of NRs. Aspect ratio of AuNRs was easily varied by changing the AgNO3 concentration (100, 150, and 300 μL) in the growth
solution, as shown in Figure 1c. The red shift in the longitudinal band depicts the increase
in aspect ratio of AuNRs from 2 to 4.7.35 Similarly, seeding growth process was used for faceted BP–NPs
formation, wherein seed crystals showed a characteristic absorption
band at 515 nm. The growth solution “A” produced highly
faceted gold NPs, which were then grown into bipyramidal structures
in the growth solution “B”. The bands formed at 530
and 680 nm were corresponding to transverse and longitudinal bands
of BPs. TEM investigations showed that NRs as well as BPs were well
dispersed and stable. The diameter and length of NRs were about 8
± 1 and 30 ± 2 nm, respectively, i.e., aspect ratio (L/D) of about 4 ± 0.3 (Figure 2). Similarly, the average length
of the BPs was about 25 nm; however, it depends on the number of intermediate
steps used for the growth process.36 Sequential
addition of AA, CTAB, and AgNO3 during the growth resulted
in multifaceted growth into bipyramid structures.

and (b) AuBPs.

The microreactor capsules
with NRs and BPs were fabricated using
LbL deposition of alternate layers of PAH and DS over modified CaCO3 templates as illustrated in Scheme 1. Mixing of preformed AuNRs or AuBPs with
Na2CO3 during template preparation resulted
in CaCO3 microparticles with incorporated NRs (CaCO3–AuNR) or BPs (CaCO3–AuBP), as shown
in Figure 3a. The template
particles obtained were well dispersed and stable with size of 3.5
± 0.25 μm. Notably, NRs of about 30 nm were visible on
the surface of modified CaCO3–AuNR templates (inset
in Figure 3a). This
negatively charged modified core was then coated sequentially by two
bilayers of PAH (positively charged polymer) and DS (negatively charged
polymer) (PAH/DS)2, with PAH being the first layer. Hollow
microreactor capsules incorporated with ANPs were obtained by dissolving
the modified sacrificial template with 0.2 M EDTA (Figure 3). The obtained capsules appeared
with folds and creases that were typical for hollow capsules of thin
polymeric shell. Notably, the AuNRs or AuBPs were distributed uniformly
within the shell, confirming their successful encapsulation. The yield
of ANPs was apparently high, and there was no sign of aggregation.
The shell thickness was estimated from TEM investigations, which was
about 200 nm.

of hollow capsules.

2.2 Catalytic
Conversion of PNP to PAP
Catalyst NPs in free and capsule
forms were investigated for catalyzing
the reduction of nitro compound PNP to PAP in aqueous phase using
NaBH4 to evaluate their potential in catalysis application.
As reduction of nitrophenol is a common starting or intermediate step
in organic reactions, we have adopted this reaction to evaluate the
potential of synthesized catalysts. The movement of NaBH4 to catalyst surface results in hydride (Au–H species) formation
on the surface, which is not only responsible for attracting PNP to
surface but also reduces it to PAP.37 Previous
reports demonstrated that the presence of positively charged CTAB
on the NPs surface did not alter the rate of reaction. Although the
reason was not clear, it was stated that a small amount of CTAB adsorbed
on NPs surface did not affect the catalytic activity of ANPs or spherical
NPs.24 Interestingly, the rate of reaction
is influenced by CTAB when the reaction is performed in CTAB solution.
It was possible that positively charged CTAB in the solution might
have reduced the transport of hydride ions to catalyst surface and
hence played an important role in reducing the rate of reaction. Four
types of catalyst samples, namely, free AuBPs, free AuNRs, PAH/DS/AuBP
microcapsules, and PAH/DS/AuNR microcapsules, were prepared and used
for catalytic conversion of PNP. The sample details are summarized
in Table 1. The reaction
was started by adding a specific amount of catalyst NPs (free NPs
or microreactors) to the aqueous solution of PNP and NaBH4. The conversion of PNP to PAP was monitored by observing the PNP
characteristic peak at 400 nm using UV–vis spectroscopy. With
increase in time, the absorption peak at 400 nm started to decrease,
which indicated the reduction of PNP. At the same time, the appearance
of a new peak at 300 nm confirmed the formation of PAP. As expected,
control capsules without ANPs did not initiate the reaction.

2.2.1 Conversion by Free ANPs
in Suspension
PNP conversion started as soon as a specific
amount of free AuNRs
(∼1.67 × 10–4 g/mL) or free AuBPs (∼6.67
× 10–4 g/mL) was added into the aqueous mixture
of PNP and NaBH4, as shown in Figure 4. The time required to achieve 100% conversion
was 45 and 65 min for AuNR and AuBP, respectively. Although the amount
of catalyst NPs used for AuNRs was less, the reaction took place at
a higher rate for AuNRs than for AuBPs. Previous reports showed that
chemisorption of hydrogen molecules was more on low-coordinated gold
atoms, i.e., NPs with more corner and edge sites.38 AuBPs do have more edged sites, but the reaction was found
to be slower compared to AuNRs. It is possible that the effective
surface area available for reduction process was less for AuBPs. The
rate constants were calculated corresponding to the negative slope
of ln([PNP]/[PNPi]) vs time, where [PNP] denotes the concentration
of PNP at different time points and [PNPi] denotes the
initial concentration of PNP at the start of the reaction (Figure 4). The calculated
rate constants were 0.00131 s–1 for AuNRs and 0.00104
s–1 for AuBPs. Approximately, 0.03 and 0.26 g of
free AuNRs and AuBPs, respectively, were required as catalysts to
convert per gram of PNP.

different time intervals

2.2.2 Conversion by Microreactor
Capsules
To estimate the catalytic activity, catalyst in
capsule form was
added to the reactant solution while keeping other parameters constant.
Notably, microreactors retained their catalytic activity and catalyzed
the PNP-to-PAP conversion process. The conversion is a multistep process
as follows: (a) movement of NaBH4 and PNP from bulk to
the capsule shell, (b) transport of NaBH4 and PNP from
shell to interior and to ANP surface, (c) hydride formation and conversion
to PAP, and (d) desorption from the surface and backward movement
to bulk. As the reactants and products had to move through porous
shell, the time required to achieve 100% conversion was more for microreactor
system compared to free ANPs. The amounts of microreactor capsules
used were ∼2 × 10–3 g/mL for PAH/DS/AuNR
capsules and ∼2.5 × 10–3 g/mL for PAH/DS/AuBP
capsules. Figure 5 shows
UV–vis spectra and the linear trends obtained during the catalysis
reaction. The time required for total conversion was 60 and 85 min
for microreactors with AuNRs and AuBPs, respectively. Interestingly,
the rate of AuNR-catalyzed reaction was higher compared to the AuBP
system, and the trend was also matching well with free NPs in suspension.
The estimated rate constant values were 0.00125 s–1 for PAH/DS/AuNR capsules and 0.00097 s–1 for PAH/DS/AuBP
capsules, which depicted their efficiency as microreactors. To investigate
the reusability of the capsule system, microreactors were separated
by centrifugation and dispersed in fresh reactant solution, and experiments
were conducted for three continuous cycles. Similarly to the first
cycle, 100% conversion was achieved for the second and third cycles
also, however, with a slight increase in conversion time. The time
required for 100% conversion was 45, 58, and 70 min for the first,
second, and third cycles, respectively. Approximately, 0.52 and 0.21
g of PAH/DS/AuNRs and PAH/DS/AuBP capsules, respectively, were required
as catalysts to convert per gram of PNP. To investigate the role of
aspect ratio of NRs, microreactors with NRs of varying aspect ratio
ranging from 2 to 4.7 were synthesized and used for catalysis. The
time required for complete conversion of PNP was 70, 77, and 72 min
for NRs of aspect ratios 2.67, 3, and 4, respectively. Previous report
showed that the rate of reaction was slightly higher for longer NRs
(aspect ratio = 33 ± 0.5) compared to shorter NRs (aspect ratio
= 2.8 ± 0.2).24 However, we did not
observe any difference in conversion time and rate constants. We believe
that only larger difference in aspect ratio of the NRs might significantly
influence the rate of the reaction.

at different time intervals
and the corresponding plots of ln([PNP]/[PNPi]) vs time
for (a, b) PAH/DS/AuNR microcapsules and (c, d) PAH/DS/AuBP microcapsules
as catalysts.

For comparative study,
the PAP conversion of different systems
was estimated as a function of time (Figure 6). Even though larger amounts of free and
capsule forms of AuBPs displayed an efficient catalytic activity,
they were slower than AuNRs. Overall, AuNRs in free and capsule forms
were better than AuBPs in free and capsule forms. Notably, rate constants
were 1.31 times greater than those of previous reports for free AuNRs
in suspension.23 Furthermore, the amount
of catalyst required to convert 1 g of PNP was much lower for our
systems. Hence, these results proved that the reported systems have
high potential for use as microreactors with better catalytic activity
and reusability.

systems.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrate highly efficient and reusable microreactor hollow
capsule system encapsulated with AuNRs and AuBPs for catalysis application.
Microreactor capsules made of PAH and DS were prepared by modified
template approach, wherein CaCO3 microparticles containing
preformed AuNRs or AuBPs were used as sacrificial template for LbL
assembly to fabricate PAH/DS/AuNR or PAH/DS/AuBP capsules. Well-dispersed
and stable ANPs of size 25–30 nm were observed in the interior
of the microreactor capsule system. Microreactors showed excellent
catalytic activity for reduction of PNP to PAP in the presence of
NaBH4 in aqueous phase. Reaction kinetics demonstrated
that the reaction was of pseudo-first order. A 100% conversion was
achieved for all of the catalyst systems, and the reaction rate was
higher for AuNRs in capsule and free forms compared to AuBPs. The
increase in aspect ratio of AuNRs from 2 to 4.7 did not significantly
influence the conversion and rate constants. Microreactors retained
catalytic activity even after three cycles and confirmed the reusability
of the reported system. The methodology and microreactor system reported
here can be useful for other shapes also and will be useful in various
applications such as catalysis, drug delivery, and imaging.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals
Gold(III)
chloride trihydrate
(HAuCl4), PAH (Mw = 17 500
Da), DS (Mw > 500 000 Da), AA, EDTA
and CTAB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other chemicals such
as NaBH4, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium citrate, calcium chloride (CaCl2), silver nitrate
(AgNO3), and PNP were purchased from SRL India Pvt. Ltd. Poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS, Mw = 70 000) was received from Alfa Aesar
Pvt. Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without
further purification. All of the experiments were performed with freshly
prepared stock solution. Milli-Q water with resistivity >18.2 MΩ
cm at 25 °C from Millipore water purification system was used
for all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of AuNRs
The AuNRs with
aspect ratio of 4 ± 0.3 were synthesized by seed-mediated approach
according to a previously reported method.35 The Au seed was prepared by adding 0.6 mL of ice-cold NaBH4 into 10 mL of solution containing 0.1 M CTAB and 0.25 mM HAuCl4 while continuously stirring at 25 °C. After addition,
the solution turned yellowish brown, indicating the formation of seed
crystals of ∼4 nm with maximum absorption at 475 nm. After
storing the seed crystals for 45 min, they were grown into NRs by
mixing 12 μL of seed into a 10 mL solution of 0.1 M CTAB and
0.5 mM HAuCl4 with 200 μL of AgNO3 and
70 μL of AA. Color change to violet was observed within 30 min,
and the absorption spectrum was acquired to confirm the formation
of NRs. The NRs were then washed thrice with water for further use.
AuNRs with aspect ratio ranging from 2 to 4.7 were prepared by varying
the AgNO3 concentration (100, 150, and 300 μL) during
the growth process.

4.3 Synthesis of AuBPs
A seeding growth
process with AgNO3 was applied for the synthesis of AuBPs
as reported earlier.36 The Au seed here
was prepared by adding 0.6 mL of ice-cold solution of NaBH4 into a mixture of 0.2 mL of 2.5 mM trisodium citrate and 19.8 mL
of 0.25 mM HAuCl4. The citrate ions served as capping agent
at this step, which allowed growth of particles in [110] and [111]
facets.36 The solution turned orange red,
confirming the formation of seed. For the preparation of growth solution,
two solutions A and B containing 9 mL of a solution of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB were prepared for the stepwise growth of AuBPs.
AgNO3 (100 μL) was added only to B, while 50 μL
of AA was added to both A and B. Thereafter, 1 mL of seed solution
was added to A for 10 s under stirring and 1 mL of this solution was
immediately transferred to B. Violet color was observed after incubation
of solution B at 30 °C for 12 h, which was then investigated
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Finally, it was washed thrice
to obtain AuBPs for further use.

4.4 Synthesis
of Modified CaCO3 Template
for LbL Assembly
The modified sacrificial template was synthesized
by adding preformed AuNRs or AuBPs during the formation of CaCO3 template by colloidal crystallization method.29 In brief, equimolar solutions of 0.3 M Na2CO3 and CaCl2 were prepared in water.
Prior to synthesis process, PSS solution (1 mg/mL) and suspension
of preformed AuNRs/AuBPs were added to Na2CO3 solution. Finally, CaCl2 solution was added in a dropwise
manner to form colloidal CaCO3–AuNR or CaCO3–AuBP templates. PSS was added to impart stability
to the synthesized templates. This template was finally washed thrice
with water and dried for further use.

4.5 Fabrication
of PAH/DS Microreactor Capsules
Incorporated with AuNR or AuBP
The microreactor PAH/DS capsules
containing AuNRs (PAH/DS/AuNRs) or AuBPs (PAH/DS/AuBPs) in the inner
hollow structure were fabricated by the LbL approach. The modified
template (either CaCO3–AuNRs or CaCO3–AuBPs) was dispersed in 2 mL of 1 mg/mL PAH solution for
15 min. The polymer-coated particles were separated by centrifugation
at 5000 rpm (Hermle Labortechnik, Germany) and washed thrice with
Milli-Q water to remove loosely bound PAH molecules. The particles
coated with PAH layer were dispersed again in DS for 15 min, and washing
was done three times with Milli-Q water. One layer of PAH and one
layer of DS was termed as one bilayer. After deposition of two bilayers
of PAH and DS, the core was dissolved using 0.2 M EDTA solution to
obtain hollow capsules containing AuNRs/AuBPs in their inner structure.

4.6 Conversion of PNP to PAP Using Microreactor
Capsules
Capsules with encapsulated NRs or BPs were investigated
for their catalytic activity for the reduction of PNP to PAP, as shown
in Scheme 1. Capsules
prepared in a single batch were used for catalytic experiments to
get consistent results. To estimate the number of capsules and amount
of NPs in the capsules, a capsule suspension of 1 mL was first dried
at 80 °C for 2 h (until there is no weight difference) and the
final weight (combined weight of capsule and ANPs) was measured. The
mass of ANPs present in 1 mL of capsule suspension was estimated by
burning the dried capsule mass in a tubular furnace at 400 °C
for 1.5 h. Average sizes of NPs and capsules were estimated by measuring
individual sizes of at least 100 NPs or capsules from TEM images.
By using the density and average size of gold NPs and capsules, the
total number of capsules and particles per unit volume of the suspension
was estimated.

Prior to catalytic conversion, 1 mL of 1 mM PNP
was mixed with 1 mL of 0.1 mol/L NaBH4. Specific amounts
of aqueous sample containing microreactor capsules (30 μL of
PAH/DS/AuNR microcapsule stock having 2.9 × 108 capsules
or 55 μL of PAH/DS/AuBP microcapsule stock having 3.6 ×
108 capsules) were added to the mixture to start the reaction
as specified in Table 1. The reaction kinetics was studied by measuring the absorbance of
PNP at 400 nm using UV–vis spectroscopy at different time intervals.
After the completion of the reaction, the PNP solution turned from
yellow to colorless, indicating the formation of reduced product PAP.
The same experiments were repeated with free AuBPs or AuNRs as catalysts
for investigation of the effectiveness of microreactor capsules. The
conversion time and rate constants were estimated using the initial
PNP concentration and concentration at different time points. The
rate constants were calculated from the slope of ln([PNP]/[PNPi]) vs time curve, where [PNP] is the concentration of PNP
at a particular time interval and [PNPi] is the initial
concentration. The kinetic data satisfactorily fitted the pseudo-first-order
kinetic reaction as shown below. 1  

4.7 UV–Visible Spectroscopy
UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded on a NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies) using Milli-Q water as blank. UV–vis
spectra were acquired by directly keeping 4 μL of free ANPs
or microreactor capsules suspension on the pedal of the UV–vis
spectrophotometer. For catalysis experiments, the PNP concentration
was estimated at predetermined time points to calculate the reaction
rate constants and % conversion.

4.8 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
The sample preparation for TEM analysis
was done by placing 4 μL
of sample on carbon-coated copper grid and dried overnight to remove
the moisture completely. TEM images of free ANPs and microreactor
capsules were acquired using a high-resolution transmission electron
microscope (JEOL TEM 2100 Plus, Japan) at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV.
