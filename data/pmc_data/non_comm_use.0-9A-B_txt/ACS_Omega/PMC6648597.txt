A carbon quantum
dot-based carbon paste electrode was fabricated
and used for the determination of adrenaline (AD) at the nanomolar
level. This fabricated electrode exhibited tremendous electrocatalytic
activity for the oxidation of adrenaline in supporting electrolyte
(PBS of pH 7.4). Scan rate variation studies with the modified electrode
revealed that the overall electrode process was controlled by a diffusion
process. A lower detection limit of 6 nM was achieved by chronoamperometry.
Interference by biological molecules such as serotonin (5-HT) and
ascorbic acid (AA) in the electrochemical oxidation of AD on the fabricated
electrode was tested. It was observed that with the modified electrode,
the selective determination of AD was possible. Further, with the
fabricated electrode, simultaneous analysis of AA, AD, and 5-HT was
performed, and it was observed that the overlapped peaks of these
analytes on the naked electrode were well resolved into three peaks
on the modified electrode. Along with decent sensitivity and selectivity,
the electrode also showed higher stability and antifouling nature.
The real-time application of the projected scheme was proven by employing
the said electrode for adrenaline in adrenaline bitartrate injections.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Adrenaline
(AD) is a significant hormone that has a profound effect
on neurotransmission. AD also acts as a moderator for transmission
of nerve pulses to various organs.1−3 AD is administered for
the treatment of certain ailing conditions like emphysema, bronchitis,
bronchial asthma, eye disease, glaucoma, and other allergic conditions.4−6 Research on AD has importance in the fields of life sciences and
medicine; therefore, a fast, simple, and accurate method for detecting
and quantifying AD in physiological pH conditions is of grander interest.
As AD is an electrochemically active biomolecule, an electrochemical
method will be advantageous for its quantitative determination.7−10 In an electrochemical method, the oxidized product adsorbs strongly
on the electrode surface, thus blocking its surface.11,12 In its natural state, AD exists with other chemical species such
as AA or 5-HT, which are oxidized at almost similar potential values.13−16

Devices based on electrochemical detection have been well
established
for many years. The development of modified carbon-based electrodes,
gold electrodes, and platinum electrodes in the past decades has resulted
in enormous progress in electroanalytical chemistry.17−20 Recent literature reports have claimed that some fabricated electrodes
for AD determination has been designed. Mainly, the electrochemical
detection of AD was done using carbon-based electrodes like carbon
paste electrodes,21−23 glassy carbon electrodes,24−27 and carbon nanotube-modified
electrodes.28,29 In most of the cases, the electropolymerization
techniques were employed for the fabrication of modified electrodes.
To some extent, gold electrodes have also been used for the detection
of adrenaline, normally modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
of different compounds.30 There are reports
on the use of electrodes modified with carbon nanotubes that could
be useful in the detection of AD.31,32

Carbon
quantum dots are carbon-based materials with a particle
size less than 10 nm, which have captured great interest among scientists
in recent years.33 Since they have excellent
photoluminescence properties, high surface area, and low cost, CQDs
have become a model material for various studies. Carbon quantum dots
have been used in different fields including bioimaging, nanomedicine,
photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, biosensing, and chemical sensing.34−39

Our lab has already reported the preparation and characterization
of carbon quantum dots from styrene, and their applications in angiogenic
studies and cell labeling studies were discussed in detail.40 In this paper, we are interested in the fabrication
of a CQDs/CPE and its applicability toward the simultaneous analysis
of AD, AA, and 5-HT in PBS (pH 7.4).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrochemical Characterizations
The electrochemical performance of a bare CPE (BCPE) besides the
CQDs/CPE was studied using cyclic voltammetry using K3[Fe(CN)6] as a redox probe. The cyclic voltammograms of the different
electrodes are shown in Figure 1 and were documented in 1 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] solution in a supporting electrolyte, 0.1 M KCl, at a scan rate
of 50 mV/s. A couple of distinct redox peaks was detected with peak
separation (ΔEp) of 66 mV for the
BCPE (curve a); however, the ΔEp shown by the CQDs/CPE (curve b) was ∼61 mV. On the CQDs/CPE,
the peak potential had moved to a slightly more positive value; also,
the redox peak current had increased significantly when compared to
that of the BCPE. This enhanced electrochemical performance could
be due to the increased electrical conductivity of the CQDs existing
on the electrode surface.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms of the bare CPE (curve
a) and CQDs/CPE (curve
b) in 1 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 M KCl with a scan
rate of 50 mV/s.

2.2 Electrochemical
Performance of CQDs/CPE toward
AD
Electrochemical analysis of adrenaline in physiological
conditions was carried out by cyclic voltammetry. Figure 2 depicts cyclic voltammograms
of 1 μM AD in PBS (pH 7.4) as the supporting electrolyte on
the BCPE (curve a) and CQDs/CPE (curve b) with a 50 mV/s scan rate.
It was observed that on the BCPE (curve a), AD exhibited a couple
of redox peaks. An oxidation peak current of 4.7 μA was observed
at a potential (Epa) of 0.129 V, and a
peak current of 2.3 μA corresponding to the reduction process
of AD was also observed at a potential (Epc) of −0.319 V. The quasi-reversible nature of AD on the BCPE
was observed with high peak separation (442 mV). However, the anodic-to-cathodic
peak separation of AD was reduced to 132 mV on the CQDs/CPE (curve
b). On the CQDs/CPE, a negative shift in anodic peak potential (0.073
V) and a considerable positive shift in cathodic potential (−0.059
V) were also observed. When compared with the BCPE, an appreciable
enhancement in both anodic (Ipa = 26.8
μA) and cathodic peak currents (Ipc = −20.81 μA) was observed on the CQDs/CPE. These results
revealed that in physiological conditions, the CQDs/CPE catalyzes
the electrochemical reaction of AD. This property may be attributed
to the interaction between the cationic AD with the negatively charged
layer of the CQDs/CPE.

(curve
a) and CQDs/CPE (curve b) in 0.1 M PBS of pH 7.4.

2.3 Influence of Scan Rate on the Electrochemical
Process of AD with CQDs/CPE
In order to get an idea about
the diffusion and electron transfer coefficients, the cyclic voltammograms
of 1 μM AD in pH 7.4 PBS (0.1 M) with different scan rates were
plotted. On the CQDs/CPE, a linear increase in redox peak currents
with a positive shift in peak potential was observed (Figure S1a). A similar trend was maintained by
the bare CPE (Figure S2a). The graph of
the square root of scan rate (ν) against oxidation peak current
(Ipa) reveals the existence of a linear
relationship between the peak current and the square root of scan
rate (Figures S1b and S2b) with a correlation
coefficient of 0.999 for both the CQDs/CPE and bare CPE. These observations
suggest that the electrochemical process on the electrodes was controlled
by diffusion. By using the Randles–Sevcik equation, 1  the diffusion coefficients for both the CQDs/CPE
and BCPE were calculated to be 0.64 and 0.28 cm2 s–1, respectively. Further studies revealed that a good
linear relationship exists between Epa and log ν (Figures S1c and S2c)
with correlation coefficients of 0.997 and 0.996 for the CQDs/CPE
and BCPE, respectively. From the above plot and from the equation 2  α was determined to be 0.43 for the
CQDs/CPE and 0.35 for the BCPE.

2.4 Influence
of Solution pH and Concentration
of AD
The influence of solution pH on the peak potential
(Epa) and peak current reaction of 1 μM
AD on the CQDs/CPE in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) was investigated. When the
pH was varied from 9.4 to 5.4, the oxidation peak shifted toward more
positive values (Figure S3a inset). Through
the plot of the anodic peak of AD against pH (Figure S3a), the slope was obtained to be 65 mV, which was
closer to the value of 59 mV for a two-electron transfer. The above
result suggests that the forfeiting the electrons were conveyed by
the loss of an equal number of protons. This means that an equivalent
number of protons take part in the reactions. Similarly, from Figure S3b, it was clear that the peak of AD
increased with increasing pH until it reached ∼7.4, and it
also decreased when the pH was further increased. The better sensitivity
and shape of the voltammogram of the peak suggested that pH 7.4 was
suitable for further analysis.

The effect of an increase in
concentration on the electrochemical process of AD was determined
using cyclic voltammetry. The peak current corresponding to AD oxidation
was found to be increased with increasing concentration of AD (Figure S4). During the addition, a small shift
in peak potential was also experienced. Further, in order to calculate
the detection limit of the fabricated electrode, chronoamperometric
experiments were performed. Figure 3a shows the chronoamperometric response of AD with
different concentrations (0.02 to 20 μM) at 0.129 V. The plot
of peak current against concentration of AD is depicted in Figure 3b. The obtained graph
exhibited two linearity; one from 0.02 to 0.8 μM and the other
from 0.8 to 20 μM. From the graph, the detection limit of the
fabricated electrode toward AD was calculated to be 6 nm. Performance
of the fabricated electrode was further compared with the reported
electrode for the detection of AD (Table 1).

2.5 Electrochemical Studies of 5-HT on CQDs/CPE
Figure 4 shows the
cyclic voltammograms of 1 μM 5-HT on the BCPE and CQDs/CPE in
0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). On the BCPE, 5-HT underwent
electrochemical oxidation at 0.272 V with a peak of 1.94 μA.
Compared with the BCPE, the CQDs/CPE showed high background current
with the increase in the anodic peak of 5-HT. A distinct oxidation
peak with a current of 43.05 μA appeared at 0.259 V.

2.6 Kinetics
Studies
The influence of
scan rate with the CQDs/CPE (Figure S5a) and BCPE (Figure S6a) on the potential
of 5-HT in PBS (pH 7.4) was studied. On the BCPE surface, when the
scan rate was varied from 50 to 150 mV/s, the oxidation current of
5-HT amplified considerably. It should also be noted from the above
CVs that the oxidation peak of 5-HT moved to less positive values
on both the BCPE and CQDs/CPE during the increase in scan rate, which
signifies that a kinetics limitation is in existence between the active
sites of the electrodes and 5-HT. Further, the increase in scan rate
leads to an increase in the redox peak current due to the fact that
in short-scale experiments, the reactant molecules will not have sufficient
time for completion of the catalytic reaction. Diffusion and electron-transfer
coefficients of 5-HT on the CQDs/CPE and BCPE were calculated by plotting Ip versus ν1/2 (Figures S5and S6b) and Ep versus log ν (Figures S5c and S6c). From eqs 1 and 2, D and α were calculated
to be 0.97 cm2 s–1 and 0.5 for the fabricated
CPE and 0.043 cm2 s–1 and 0.45 for the
BCPE, respectively.

2.7 Role of pH and Concentration
of 5-HT
The effect of pH on the electrochemical oxidation
of 5-HT on the
CQDs/CPE was studied by using cyclic voltammetry. Figure S7a (inset) shows the CV achieved for 10 μM 5-HT
in PBS of different pH values varying from 5.4 to 9.4 on the CQDs/CPE.
Here, yet again, a similar kind of shift in potential toward the negative
side was experienced for the pH range from 5.4 to 9.4. From the figure,
it was clear that the solution pH greatly influenced the electrochemical
oxidation nature of 5-HT. Further, the graph of Epa versus pH (Figure S7a) was
plotted, and the slope of the plot was found to be 64 mV. Here, we
could arrive at a conclusion that this reaction involved the same
number of electrons and protons as it comes very near to the standard
reaction value of 59 mV/pH for a reaction that has the same number
of protons and electrons. The plot of solution pH versus Ipa is depicted in Figure S7b. The peak current of 5-HT in PBS was higher at a pH of 5.4, it gradually
decreased at pH 6.4, it attained the maximum at pH 7.4, and it further
decreased from pH 7.4 to 9.4. Even though the peak current was comparable
at both pH 5.4 and 7.4, the nature of the peak was good at pH 7.4,
which is also the physiological pH.

Figure S8 shows the CV on the CQDs/CPE with various concentrations
of 5-HT in pH 7.4 PBS. It was clear that the current due to electrochemical
oxidation of 5-HT increased with the increase in concentration of
5-HT. The detection limit and linearity range of the CQDs/CPE toward
the oxidation of 5-HT were calculated by chronoamperometry (Figure 5a). From the calibration
plot (Figure 5b), a
lowest detection limit of 0.004 μM was achieved for 5-HT on
the CQDs/CPE. The plot of concentration versus oxidation current exhibited
a wider calibration graph with two linear ranges, one with a range
of 0.01 to 1 μM (lower) and the other of 1 to 8 μM (higher).
All these results revealed the capability of the fabricated electrode
to act as an electrochemical sensor for both adrenaline and serotonin.

determination of 5-HT in PBS of pH 7.4 with

concentration of 5-HT vs current.

2.8 Electrochemical Behavior of AA on CQDs/CPE
The electrochemical oxidation of 1 μM AA in a solution of
0.1 M PBS of pH 7.4 with a 50 mV s–1 sweep rate
on the BCPE (curve a) and CQDs/CPE (curve b) is shown in Figure 6. From the CV, it
was observed that the oxidation peak of AA on the BCPE occurred at
0.268 V. It was also observed that on the CQDs/CPE, the oxidation
peak current of AA increased considerably with a shift in potential
toward the negative side. The increase in anodic current with a negative
shift of −0.139 V suggests that the CQDs/CPE has a good catalytic
effect on the oxidation process of AA. These observations suggested
that the electron transfer of AA on the surface of the BCPE proceeded
through slow electron-transfer kinetics. On the other hand, the CQDs/CPE
surface catalyzed the oxidation process; hence, electron transfer
advanced through fast kinetics.

Figure 6 Cyclic voltammograms of 1 μM ascorbic
acid in PBS of pH 7.4
on the BCPE (curve a) and CQDs/CPE (curve b) in 0.1 M PBS with a 50
mV/s scan rate.

Further, the scan rate’s
effect on the AA oxidation with
the CQDs/CPE and BCPE (Figures S9a and S10a) was studied by varying the scan rate in PBS (pH 7.4). While increasing
the sweep rate, the oxidation peak of AA on both the bare and the
fabricated electrodes also increased linearly. From the sweep rate
studies, D and α for the BCPE were calculated
to be 0.11 cm2 s–1 and 0.37, and for
CQDs/CPE, they were 0.90 cm2 s–1 and
0.42, respectively (Figures S9b,c and S10b,c).

2.9 Effect of Solution pH and Concentration of
AA
The influence of solution pH on the electrochemical oxidation
of AA was studied from the range of 5.4 to 8.4 on the CQDs/CPE. A
maximum peak current was observed for the solution with pH 7.4; a
further increase in pH leads to a decrease in peak current (Figure S11b). This was due to the fact that AA
in solutions with a pH value higher than 5.4 exists in the anionic
form and this will electrostatically interact with the negative charge
on the CQDs. The plot of oxidation peak potential against the pH range
was also recorded (Figure S11a). A negative
shift in peak potential of AA with an increase in pH is a solid proof
for the participation of protons in the reaction. Consequently, as
we received the highest current with good sensitivity for pH 7.4 solution,
this condition was further selected as an optimum pH for further electrochemical
reactions.

Figure S12 shows the CV
of electrochemical oxidation of AA with various concentrations on
the CQDs/CPE in PBS of pH 7.4. It was clear from the CV that the concentration
of AA exhibits a direct relationship with the anodic peak current
of AA. The detection limit and linearity range of the CQDs/CPE toward
the oxidation of AA were calculated by chronoamperometry (Figure 7a). The peak current
against concentration of AA was plotted (Figure 7b). The plot exhibits two linearities, one
for the lower concentration (0.1 to 2 μM) and the other for
the higher concentration range (2 to 10 μM). From the plot using
the lower linearity, the detection limit of the fabricated electrode
toward the AA was calculated to be 0.06 μM.

determination of AA with different concentrations
with a time interval of 30 s. (b) Plot of concentration of AA vs current.

2.10 Simultaneous
Analysis of AD, 5-HT, and AA
In biological samples, as compared
to 5-HT and AA, AD is present
in low concentrations; thus, on the bare electrodes, overlapped voltammograms
due to the closeness in their oxidation potentials were observed.
Cyclic voltammograms recorded with both the bare CPE and CQDs/CPE
for a ternary solution of 1 μM AD, 0.1 mM AA, and 0.1 mM 5-HT
in pH 7.4 PBS are shown in Figure 8a. It was evident from the figure that the ternary
mixture on the CPE surface gave a broad peak at ∼0.198 V (curve
a). Meanwhile, on the CQDs/CPE, three well-separated peaks corresponding
to the oxidation of AA, AD, and 5-HT appeared at −0.140, 0.057,
and 0.236 V, respectively. The peak-to-peak separation values achieved
with the fabricated electrode are large enough to identify them simultaneously.

Figure 8 (a) Cyclic
voltammograms and (b) differential pulse voltammograms
of 0.1 mM AA and 0.1 mM 5-HT in the presence of different concentrations
of AD (from 0.2 to 70 μM) on the CQDs/CPE in pH 7.4 PBS.

The interference of AA and 5-HT
in the analysis of AD with the
modified electrode was performed by cyclic voltammetry in pH 7.4 PBS
with varying concentrations of AD in the presence of other moieties
of unvarying concentration. Furthermore, the differential pulse voltammogram
was also recorded with the CQDs/CPE in 0.1 M PBS of pH 7.4 with 0.1
mM AA, 0.1 mM 5-HT, and AD with different concentrations (Figure 8b). From the figure,
it is clear that the peak current corresponding to AD oxidation increased
linearly with the increase in its concentration but the peak potential
remains the same in the presence of AA and 5-HT. Simultaneously, it
was also observed that the peak potentials remain unaltered with any
enhancement in the peak current for the other two species. Similarly,
the increase in concentration of the other two species also did not
interfere with the oxidation current and potential of the former.

2.11 Mechanism of Sensing
The CQDs were
functionalized with hydroxyl groups; hence, the surface of the modified
electrode has negative charges. AD in solution exists in its cationic
form, and therefore, it would be attracted electrostatically toward
the negatively charged electrode surface and hence produce a higher
redox current. Conversely, AA exists in its anionic form, and thus
it would be repelled by the electrode surface. Hence, the AA oxidation
peak moved to a large negative value on the modified electrode (Scheme 1). This could be
the reason for the separation of AA and AD on the CQDs/CPE.

Scheme 1 Oxidation
of AA, AD, and 5-HT on CQDs/CPE
2.12 Real-Sample Analysis
In order to
validate the real-time application of the CQDs/CPE, the concentration
of AD present in real samples, that is, an injection sample of AD
bitartrate (1 mg/mL), was determined. Varying concentrations of AD
by a standard addition method was plotted against corresponding current.
From this calibration plot, an acceptable percentage recovery in the
range of 99.4–103.0% was achieved with the fabricated electrode.
These results revealed the potential of the fabricated electrode to
become a promising candidate for the analysis of AD in AD injections
(Table 2).

2	3	3.05	0.51	101.6	
3	5	4.97	0.88	99.4	
2.13 Reusability and Stability
of the CQDs/CPE
To facilitate the reusability, the fabricated
electrode was employed,
recording repetitive CV of AD in 0.1 M PBS of pH 7.4. Even after 20
successive potential scans, the modified electrode was able to produce
94.2% of the initial oxidation and 95.1% of the initial reduction
currents of AD (Figure 9a), suggesting the reusability of the fabricated electrode. Further,
the long-term stability of the developed electrode was analyzed, storing
the CQDs/CPE at room temperature in 0.1 M PBS and measuring the electrochemical
signals every 4 days of storage under the same conditions. On the
15th day, CVs were recorded for the electrochemical oxidation of AD
with the CQDs/CPE, and it was found that the modified electrode was
able to reproduce 90% of the initial response (Figure 9b). These results are sufficient to claim
the merit of reusability and stability of the CQDs/CPE toward the
electrochemical determination of AD.

3 Conclusions
The capability of the fabricated
CQDs/CPE for the electrochemical
oxidation of AD in 0.1 M PBS was analyzed. The sweep rate studies
with the CQDs/CPE revealed that the electrode process was controlled
by the diffusion process. When compared with the bare CPE, the CQDs/CPE
possessed larger surface area and higher electron transfer and diffusion
coefficients. The pH of the electrolyte (PBS) has also a crucial role
in the electrochemical oxidation of AD on the CQDs/CPE. A well-oriented
CV with higher sensitivity was observed for the PBS of pH 7.4. Moreover,
the overlapped voltammograms of AA, 5-HT, and AD with the bare CPE
was well resolved into three separate peaks with the fabricated electrode.
The ability of the CQDs/CPE to simultaneously determine these analytes
was further confirmed by DPV. The performance of the fabricated electrode
was highly reproducible and repeatable. The real-time application
of the constructed electrode was verified by introducing it for the
determination of concentration of AD present in the injection sample
of adrenaline bitartate with a recovery value of 99.4–103.0%.
The selectivity studies with the CQDs/CPE confirmed that even 1000-fold
concentrations of AA and 5-HT were not interfering in the oxidation
of AD.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
and Chemicals
A fresh adrenaline
(Tokyo Chemical Industry Company, Japan) solution was prepared in
0.1 M perchloric acid, a serotonin (Tokyo Chemical Industry Company,
Japan) solution in sodium hydroxide, and ascorbic acid (Riedel-de
Haën chemicals) solutions in double distilled water. The supporting
electrolyte used was 0.1 M PBS and was prepared by mixing Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4. In all the experiments,
the pH was maintained at 7.4.

4.2 Apparatus
A VSP potentiostat/galvanostat
(Biologic Science Instruments) was used for performing all the experiments.
The electrode system contained the CQDs/CPE and BCPE as the working
electrode (3.0 mm in diameter), saturated calomel as the reference
electrode (SCE), and a platinum wire as the counter electrode.

4.3 Synthesis of CQDs and Fabrication of CQDs/CPE
Carbon
quantum dots (CQDs) were prepared as described earlier.25 Briefly, carbon soot was mixed with NaOH (pH
7.4), stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min, and centrifuged
at 900 rpm for 25 min, followed by multiple steps of sonication and
centrifugation. The resultant solution was filtered. The characterized
CQDs were further used for the fabrication of the modified electrode.

A homogeneous carbon paste electrode was prepared by grinding 70%
graphite powder in 30% silicone oil. The carbon paste was packed into
the cavity of a homemade electrode, and using weighing paper, it was
smoothed out. The CQDs/CPE was prepared by drop-casting 20 μL
of CQDs on the electrode surface and dried for 20 min.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
For
the oxidation of 1 μM AD, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used with
a potential range of −0.4 to 0.5 V. Chronoamperometry (CA)
was performed with a potential of 1.2 V for 20 min for the calculation
of the detection limit and linearity range. The separation and selectivity
studies were conducted using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV)
in the potential range from −0.25 to 0.3 V. In all the cases,
0.1 M PBS of pH 7.4 was used as a supporting electrolyte.
