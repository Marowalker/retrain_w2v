Localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensors show great
potential for practical/commercial use in clinical diagnosis, home
healthcare, environmental analysis, and public healthcare. However,
two main issues, that is, low refractometric sensitivity and low reproducibility
(large-area uniformity and batch-to-batch consistency), hinder the
extensive applications of LSPR biosensors. Therefore, plasmonic nanostructures
with high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility are desirable
for preparing reliable LSPR sensors. Herein, we have fabricated plasmonic
nanopyramid arrays (NPAs) for several batches with reproducible morphology
and optical properties by elastic soft lithography and metal thermal
evaporation. NPAs of various metals (i.e., Al, Au, and Ag) were also
prepared by thermal evaporation with the according metals. The transmission
spectra of these NPAs showed several narrow LSPR peaks in the visible-infrared
wavelength region. The refractometric sensitivities of the LSPR peaks
were systematically studied, and high refractometric sensitivities
of 774.0, 472.8, and 421.0 nm/RIU were achieved on Al, Au, and Ag
NPAs, respectively. To demonstrate the potential of the NPAs for multiplex
applications, we first applied this highly sensitive Al NPA biosensor
to monitoring the process of proliferation of HeLa cancer cells, in
situ and in real time. Then, we demonstrated that the Au NPA was
able to identify the absorbed analytes on its surface through the
surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectrum. In addition, the finite
difference time domain simulations were performed to reveal the electromagnetic
field enhancement on NPAs. Because of the properties of high sensitivity
and excellent reproducibility of the metal NPA LSPR substrates, as
well as the simplicity and cost efficiency of the fabrication method,
our proposed work will accelerate the practical use of LSPR sensors.

Introduction
Plasmonic metal nanostructures
have attracted increasing attention
because of their wide applications in metamaterials,1,2 sunlight harvesting,3,4 photocatalyst,5 color display,6 and optical
sensing.7−9 Plasmonic biosensors have been appreciated as the
advancing and promising optical sensors in recent years because of
their properties of ultrasensitivity, high spatial resolution, and
label-free detections.10−13 Plasmonic biosensors are mainly divided into propagating surface
plasmon resonance (PSPR) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
biosensors.14 Compared to PSPR biosensors,
LSPR biosensors are remarkable in measuring local refractive index
(RI) changes caused by the adsorption of targeted molecules.8,15 Moreover, the optical system for LSPR sensing is simpler, whereas
SPR system requires coupler (i.e., prism or grating) to activate plasmons.
It makes the LSPR sensor more promising in the construction of miniaturized
biomedical devices.16,17 With the outstanding merits of
high spatial resolution, simple optical framework, and capacity of
label-free detection, LSPR biosensors show great potential for practical/commercial
use in clinical diagnosis,18,19 home healthcare,20 environmental analysis,21 and public healthcare.22

However,
there are two main issues that hinder the extensive applications
of LSPR biosensors, that is, low refractometric sensitivity and low
reproducibility (large-area uniformity and batch-to-batch consistency).
On the one hand, the refractometric sensitivity of the LSPR biosensor
is still low because the LSPRs generally exhibit broad resonance peaks
owing to strong radiative damping.23 According
to the physical principles, LSPR nanostructures exhibiting a shorter
decay length and more enhanced electromagnetic field (EF) in a smaller
volume than the planar metallic surface can respond better to the
local RI (n) changes near the metallic surfaces.
To enhance the local EF, many efforts have been made such as changing
the size and shape24−26 and/or the spatial arrangement27,28 of the metal nanoparticles and nanostructures. To obtain largely
enhanced EF at confined small sites (so-called “hotspots”),
deliberately designed sharp tips, sharp edges,29 and narrow gaps between the two nanostructures30 on LSPR substrates are highly desirable.

On the other hand, the nanostructures are inhomogeneous in large
area and vary from batch to batch. The spot-to-spot and batch-to-batch
consistency of the nanostructures is the key to reproducible
LSPR response among the measurements of all sensing subsctrates, which
is essential for the practical use of LSPR sensors.31 There are mainly two conventional approaches to fabricate
the LSPR nanostructures: chemical synthesis and physical preparation.
In chemical methods, nanocrystals were synthesized in the solution
phase and then deposited on a flat substrate to prepare a LSPR sensor.
In this case, chemical methods are facing problems of the difficulty
in controlling the interdistance between the nanocrystals and eliminating
the inconsistency of the nanostructures between different batches.32 Compared to chemical synthesis, physical preparation
is more promising for LSPR sensors because of the controllable interspace
of nanostructures and non-contamination of the metal surface. In physical
preparations, e-beam lithography,33 focused
ion beam lithography,34 and photolithography35 can realize the precise control of size, shape,
and interspace among the metal nanostructures, but they still can
not provide low-cost production of large-area nanostructures. Nanosphere
lithography,36,37 template stripping,38 elastic soft lithography (ESL)39 are the next-generation approaches that provide cheap production
of large-area nanostructures. However, some efforts are still required
to obtain a satisfactory LSPR sensor with spot-to-spot and batch-to-batch
consistency by these approaches.

Herein, to address these two
issues, we proposed a well-designed
metal nanopyramid array (NPA) with high refractometric sensitivity
and high reproducibility prepared by ESL and metal thermal evaporation.
In the ESL procedures, NPAs with geometries of tapering nanostructure
can be easily detached from the template stamp without damage. Therefore,
we have fabricated NPAs with excellent reproducibility in large area
and in different batches. In the metal thermal evaporation procedure,
Al, Au, and Ag NPAs were obtained, respectively. Their transmission
spectra showed several narrow LSPR peaks in the visible-infrared wavelength
region, and the spectra of NPAs from different batches were consistent.
The refractometric sensitivities of the LSPR peaks were systematically
investigated, and the Al NPA held a highest refractometric sensitivity
of 774.0 nm/RIU. This highly sensitive Al NPA was applied to monitoring
the process of proliferation of HeLa cancer cells. In addition, the
Au NPA with enhanced local EF was used to provide a surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum of the 4-methylbenzenethiol (4-MBT)
monolayer. Furthermore, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations
were performed to investigate the EF enhancement of the NPAs. This
work will accelerate the practical process of LSPR sensors on the
basis of the simplicity and cost efficiency of the fabrication method,
as well as the properties of excellent reproducibility and high sensitivity
of the NPA LSPR substrate.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication of Reproducible
Metal NPAs
Figure 1 shows the scheme of fabricating
metal NPAs by two steps: ESL and subsequent metal thermal evaporation.
The as-prepared metal NPA is composed of a transparent polymer substrate
and a 50 nm thick metal deposition. ESL was performed by a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) nanostamp and an UV-cured norland optical adhesive (NOA). The
PDMS nanostamp is flexible and reusable for more than 50 times, which
can reduce the costs for mass production. We are able to measure the
transmission spectra of such a NPA because the NOA substrate is transparent,
which greatly simplified the detection system.40 On the basis of the tapering shape of the nanopyramid,
the NPA substrate was easily detached from its complementary nanostamp
in the ESL procedure, which enabled the uniformity in a large area
and the consistency between different batches. The uniformity of the
NPA in a large area (0.25 cm2) is demonstrated in Figure S1, and the consistency of NPAs from five
batches in morphologies and optical properties are shown in Figures 1B–D and S2, respectively. Various types of metal NPAs
(Al NPA, Au NPA, and Ag NPA) were prepared by the subsequent thermal
evaporation (Figure S3). Figures 1B–D and S4 show the morphologies of NPAs through the
45° side-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and top-view
SEM images. The lattice constant of the array (l)
is 1.4 μm, the height of the nanopyramid (h) is 590 nm, and the depth of the nanoconcave (d) is 368 nm. This nanopyramid possessed geometries of nanotips and
nanoedges (Figure S4), which enabled the
presence of hotspots for high sensitivity of refractometric sensing
and SERS. This two-dimensional (2D) NPA features a morphology similar
to that of bulk NPA in our previous work.7 However, in contrast to the fabrication technique of electrochemical
etching used in the previous work, the technique of ESL used here
was simple, cost-efficient, and accessible to reproducible NPAs.

thermal evaporation. (B–D) Side-view SEM images of Al NPAs

scale bars in (B–D) are 1 μm.

Optical Properties of Al, Au, and Ag NPAs
Figure 2A shows the normal
transmission spectra of the as-obtained Al, Au, and Ag NPAs in air
at the wavelength region from 400 to 1100 nm. The transmission spectra
of corresponding metal flat films were also measured as references
(Figure 2B). Multiple
characteristic peaks were observed on the spectra of metal NPAs in
contrast to those of flat films. Our previous work of bulk Al NPAs
with similar morphologies displayed several LSPR peaks in the whole
UV–visible–infrared region as well.7 The troughs at 700 nm and at ∼990 nm (equals to  and , respectively) of all three metal NPAs
mainly resulted from the second-order Rayleigh diffraction anomaly
between the adjacent nanopyramids and between the diagonally adjacent
nanopyramids, respectively.41 It is noteworthy
mentioning that the peak of the Al NPA at 827 nm located in the region
of bio-optical window (700–1100 nm), which made it a promising
candidate for biosensing involving tissues and cells. For both Au
NPA (curve b, Figure 2A) and Au flat film (curve b, Figure 2B), the large resonance peak at 502 nm was the characteristic
PSPR peak.42 All of these peaks here presented
relatively narrow bandwidth, in which the smallest full width at half-maximum
was 21.7 nm from the Ag NPA, benefiting the refractometric sensing
of NPAs based on the LSPR peak shift.43

(B) exposed in air (curve a for Al, curve b for Au, and curve c for
Ag). The insets show the perpendicular transmission system employed
in the sensing process.

Refractometric Sensitivities of Al, Au, and Ag NPAs
We have
measured the transmission spectra of NPAs when they were
covered by superstrates with different RIs. The superstrates were
air (n = 1) and glycerol/water mixtures with different
ratios (n = 1.333, 1.355, 1.386, 1.417, and 1.447).
A normal transmission optical path was used during the measurements
to eliminate systematic errors caused by the RI variation of superstrates.39 As the RI increased, the resonance peaks and
troughs of the NPAs red shifted and the transmittance increased as
well, as shown in Figure 3A–C. The relationships between the peak/trough position
and the corresponding RI (n) for Al, Au, and
Ag NPAs were exhibited in Figure 3D–F, respectively. Linear fitting results of
these relationships were demonstrated with high goodness of fit (R2 > 0.99), and the slopes of the linear fitting
curves indicated the refractometric sensitivities. The refractometric
sensitivities of these peaks tended to augment with the increase of
the peak wavelength, and the refractometric sensitivities of these
troughs also exhibited the similar phenomenon (Figure S5). Notably, high refractometric sensitivities of
774.0, 472.8, and 421.0 nm/RIU were observed on Al, Au, and Ag NPAs,
respectively. A summary of Al nanostructures for refractometric biosensing
is provided in Table S1. To our best knowledge,
this refractometric sensitivity of 774 nm/RIU was the highest one
among those of Al nanoparticles and 2D Al nanostructures. In addition,
it is closed to the refractometric sensitivity of the bulk Al NPA
(819 nm/RIU).7 Besides the similar high
sensitivity, this 2D Al NPA exceeded the bulk Al NPA in the mass-producing
procedure based on the high reproducibility and the cost efficiency
of its preparing methods. These advantages made the 2D NPA a competing
candidate as LSPR biosensor for practically biomedical applications.

The troughs and peaks are arrowed in (A–C). The slopes of the
linear fitting curves indicate the refractometric sensitivities, whose
unit is nm/RIU. Error bars for each point are too small to been seen.

Semiquantitative Detection
of Cell Concentration by the Al NPA
Monitoring the proliferation
of cancer cells is significant for
investigating the growth, infiltration, recurrence, and migration
of tumors. We integrated the as-prepared Al NPA with a high refractometric
sensitivity into a LSPR sensing platform for monitoring the proliferation
of HeLa cancer cells in situ and in real time. To avoid the influence
of the optical absorption spectra of cellular components, P3 at the infrared region with a high refractometric sensitivity (630.2
nm/RIU) was used for the measurements. Healthy HeLa cells with controlled
amount (30 000 cells per mL) were seeded on the Al NPA and
constantly proliferated for 96 h without fully covering the metal
surface. The cells have higher RI (ncytoplasm = 1.38, nmembrane = 1.48) than that
in the culture medium (nmedium = 1.33).
With the proliferation of cells, increasing cells replaced the culture
medium and occupied more sensing area of the Al NPA. As a result,
the RI near the surface of the Al NPA increased constantly. In addition,
this variation of the local RI was demonstrated by the shift of the
LSPR peak. As shown in Figure 4A, transmission spectra (from 920 to 990 nm) of this Al NPA
were measured every 24 h. In addition, the resonance peak red shifted
for ∼7.2 nm (from 949.4 to 956.6 nm) in 96 h. A linear relationship
between the peak position (λ) and time (t) was observed (Figure 4B, red line). Micrographs
of the cells were recorded at the same time points (Figure S6), to certify the enlarging amount of cells and the
cells partly covering the NPA. From the micrographs, we recorded the
cell spreading area at different times (Figure 4B, black columns). Using the Pearson correlation
coefficient, a significant correlation was observed between the cell
spreading area and the LSPR peak shift (r = 0.979, P = 0.004).

0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h (curve a to curve e). The maximal peak shift
(Δλmax) is about 7.2 nm. (B) Relationship between
the LSPR peak position and the proliferation time (red columns) and
the relationship between the cell spreading area and the proliferation
time (black columns). The red line indicates the linear relationship
between the peak position and time. Using the Pearson correlation
coefficient, a significant correlation was observed between the cell
spreading area and the LSPR peak position (r = 0.979, P = 0.004).

Cell proliferation can be detected by other experimental
methods
(such as microscope, piezoelectric sensing, electric cell-substrate
impedance sensing, and surface plasmon resonance sensing). However,
our method based on the LSPR biosensor has two advantages compared
to the above methods. The equipment that we need is a spectrometer,
which is low-cost. In addition, information such as cell-substrate
interaction is able to be obtained by LSPR sensors while it is not
provied by other sensors. Since the LSPR sensor is sensitive to the
RI in the vicinity of the metal surface, only the alive cells contact
closely to the substrate and induce the LSPR signals, whereas the
dead cells suspend in the culture medium without interfering the signals.
Therefore, our LSPR sensors mainly obtained the signals caused by
the alive cells on the sensor surface. 

Qualitative Identification
of Molecules on the Au NPA
The enhanced localized EF induced
by LSPR has not only been utilized
in refractometric biosensing but also in surface-enhanced assays such
as surface-enhanced fluorescence44 and
SERS.45−47 SERS can provide a structural fingerprint of an analyte,
which can be applied to identifying the molecules functioning in the
process of the cell-substrate interaction.48,49 Here, we demonstrate the capacity of the NPA to work as a SERS substrate.
We immersed the Au NPA substrate in a solution of the model analyte,
4-MBT. This molecule was adsorbed on the NPA based on the strong Au–S
linkage between the molecule and the Au surface. Figure 5A shows the Raman spectra of
4-MBT solution (normalized, curve a), 4-MBT monolayer-absorbed Au
flat film (curve b), bare Au NPA (curve c), and 4-MBT monolayer-absorbed
Au NPA (curve d). The characteristic peak at ∼1100 cm–1 was attributed to a combination of the phenyl ring breathing mode,
CH in-plane bending, and CS stretching.50 There was no peak appeared at around 1100 cm–1 on the Raman spectrum of the 4-MBT-absorbed Au flat film, whereas
an enhance peak at 1099 cm–1 was observed on the
Raman spectrum of the 4-MBT-absorbed Au NPA. A schematic diagram in Figure 5B indicates how 4-MBT
absorbed on the Au flat film (scheme b) and the Au NPA (scheme d),
and then responded to the Raman exciting laser. Compared to the flat
film, there were hotspots (localized enhanced EF) induced by LSPRs
occurring on the nanotips and nanoedges of NPAs; therefore, these
hotspots enhanced the Raman scattering signals.

Figure 5 (A) Raman spectra of
the 4-MBT solution (normalized, curve a),
a Au flat film adsorbed with 4-MBT (curve b), a bare Au NPA (curve
c), and a Au NPA adsorbed with 4-MBT (curve d). A peak at 1099 cm–1 was observed at the Raman scattering spectra of the
4-MBT solution and the Au NPA adsorbed with 4-MBT. (B) Schematic diagrams
illustrating the structure of 4-MBT and the Raman scattering process
of the 4-MBT solution (a), a Au flat film adsorbed with the 4-MBT
monolayer (b), a bare Au NPA (c), and a Au NPA adsorbed with the 4-MBT
monolayer (d). (C) FDTD simulations of EF distribution for the Au
flat film and the Au NPA with light at normal incidence. The dashed
lines and curves outline the 50 nm thick Au layers of the Au flat
film and the Au NPA. EF enhancement was observed at the nanotip and
the nanoedge. The scale bars in (C) are 200 nm.

To investigate the mechanism of SERS capacity and high refractometric
sensitivity of NPAs, we have simulated the EF distribution of the
Au flat film and the Au NPA by using the FDTD solutions (Figure 5C). Band-shaped EF
distribution was observed above the Au flat film, resulting from the
interference between the incident and reflected light. In contrast,
localized hotspots at both tip and edges of the nanopyramid were attained
on the Au NPA. The localization and intensification of EF on the NPA
can improve the performance of the LSPR biosensor for refractometric
and surface-enhanced Raman biosensing.

In conclusion, we have
prepared a type of plasmonic NPA with excellent
reproducibility (large-area uniformity and batch-to-batch consistency)
by using ESL and metal thermal evaporation, which obtained high refractometric
sensitivity based on hotspots at nanotips and nanoedges. Specific
detection of molecules such as cancer biomarkers or thrombin could
be achieved on such a LSPR biosensor after chemical modification.7,51 In addition, the Au NPA-based SERS illustrated that this NPA LSPR
nanosubstrate is capable to be applied in molecular identification,
such as the detection of glucose.52 In
comparison to the existing LSPR biosensors, our proposed work exhibit
the following advantages: (1) the NPA with the geometry of the tapering
nanostructure is very suitable for ESL. Compared to the nanopillar
and nanomushroom, a nanopyramid is much easier to be detached from
its complementary nanostamp without damage. This characteristic makes
the NPA biosensor prepared by ESL approaches highly reproducible,
which indicates the remarkable reliability of LSPR biosensors for
practical use; (2) the fabricating technique combining ESL and metal
thermal evaporation has provided various types of metal NPAs (e.g.,
Al, Au, and Ag NPAs), meeting the demands of different situations.
This fabrication technique could also utilize other non-noble metal
materials such as Cu to fabricate NPAs. Moreover, these non-noble
metal NPAs including Al NPA with properties of low cost, ease to process,
and abundant mineral reserve have great potential in constructing
high-performance LSPR biosensors; (3) the NPAs with deliberately designed
sharp tips and edges confine light into nanoscale regions and create
dense hotspots for highly sensitive refractometric biosensing and
surface-enhanced spectroscopies, certifying the potential of the NPAs
for multiplex applications; (4) the NPA will enable the combination
of quantitative LSPR sensing and qualitative SERS analysis, where
the transmittance changes of UV–visible spectra (light through
the NPA) that involve the information of the concentrations and the
Raman scattering signals (light backward from the NPA surface) reveals
the molecular structure. Considering the simplicity and cost efficiency
of the fabrication method, as well as the properties of excellent
reproducibility and high sensitivity, this NPA LSPR substrate will
accelerate the process of applying the LSPR sensor into practical
use such as clinical diagnosis, home healthcare, environmental analysis,
and public healthcare.

Methods
Materials
PDMS
(SYLGARD 184) was purchased from Dow
Corning (US). NOA61 was obtained from Norland Products (US). Gold,
silver, and aluminum particles for metal thermal evaporation were
from ZhongNuo Advanced Material Technology Company (Beijing, China).
Ethanol and glycerol were supplied by Damao chemical reagent (Tianjin,
China). For cells’ experiments, the Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium was purchased from HyClone (US). Bovine serum
was from Gibco (Singapore). For SERS experiments, 4-MBT was obtained
from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). All chemicals and solvents used were
of analytical grade and were used as received. Deionized water was
used for all experiments.

Fabrication of Metal NPAs
A bulk
Al NPA template was
previously fabricated through denting and subsequent electrochemical
etching on a flat aluminum sheet.7 A well-mixed
liquid PDMS prepolymer was poured onto the template, degassed, and
solidified in an oven (80 °C, 30 min). The solidified PDMS nanostamp
was then peeled off from the template. During the next ESL process,
the solution was dripped onto the PDMS nanostamp. To increase the
sharpness of the nanopyramid, a type of NOA61 solution with lower
viscosity was employed and a 12 h standing in the vacuum was operated.
The NOA61 substrate was then solidified under UV light (Kinsten KVB-30D,
Taiwan) (15 W, 5 min) and peeled off. After that, 50 nm thick Al,
Au, or Ag layers were deposited onto the NOA61 substrate through thermal
evaporation.

It is worth mentioned that a stable native oxide
layer of aluminum on the Al NPA was formed in hours, with a thickness
stabilizing at 2.5–3 nm.53 In addition,
the workability of the passivated aluminum nanostructure as an optical
biosensor has also been proved.54

Characterization
of NPAs and Nanofilms
SEM images of
metal NPAs were captured by a SEM (Zeiss Auriga). The transmission
spectra of Al, Au, and Ag NPAs under different superstrates of air
(n = 1) and glycerol/water mixtures were measured
using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Inesa L3S). The mixing
ratios of the above mixtures are 0, 25.96, 41.46, 62.50, and 86.57
wt %, whereas the according RIs are 1.333, 1.355, 1.386, 1.417, and 1.447, respectively. To determine
the standard deviation (SD) of the peak position, three measurements
were performed at each RI. The appearance of the NPA chip was captured
by cell phone (iPhone 5S).

In the cell experiment, the Al NPA
was previously immobilized on the inner wall of the cell culture flask.
The whole flask was then sterilized and washed by phosphate-buffered
saline. Transmission spectra of the NPA biosensor were measured every
24 h after healthy HeLa cancer cells were seeded on the surface of
the nanostructure. To determine the SD of the peak position, three
measurements were performed at each time. In the meantime, micrographs
of cells on the Al NPA were taken from an inverted fluorescence microscope
(Nikon Eclipse Ti-U). The area of each micrograph is 1/300 of the
area of Al NPA. We counted the pixel points in the micrograph and
multiplied 300 to estimate the whole cell spreading area on Al NPA.

In the SERS experiment, the Au NPA and the Au film were both immersed
in the 4-MBT/ethanol solution (0.05 M, 3 mL) in a Petri dish (Φ
= 3.5 cm) for 15 min, respectively. Then, they were washed by ethanol
and dried in air. The Raman spectra of 0.05 M 4-MBT solution, 4-MBT-adsorbed
Au film, bare Au NPA, and 4-MBT-adsorbed Au NPA were measured on a
Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia Reflex). The Raman spectrum of
the 4-MBT solution (0.05 M) was normalized for further analysis. The
wavelength of the excitation laser was 532 nm. The laser power and
signal acquisition time were 1 mW and 10 s, respectively.

FDTD Simulation
The EF distribution of the Au film
and the Au NPA under a 532 nm light source was simulated using FDTD
solutions (Lumerical Solutions). The NPA was simplified as a combination
of two vertical gradient grating arrays and one nanocone array. All
of the dimension parameters were set according to the SEM images.
Mesh size for the metal region was 3 nm (x-, y-, and z-directions). The RI of NOA61
was 1.56.
