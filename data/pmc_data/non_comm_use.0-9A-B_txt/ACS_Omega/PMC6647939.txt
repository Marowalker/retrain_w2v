Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a cross-linking
enzyme identified 50 years
ago, but its 3D structure is still unknown. We have thus built a 3D
model of human LOX by homology modeling using the X-ray structure
of human lysyl oxidase-like 2 as a template. This model is the first
one to recapitulate all known biochemical features of LOX, namely,
the coordination of the copper ion and the formation of the lysine
tyrosylquinone cofactor and the disulfide bridges. Furthermore, this
model is stable during a 1 μs molecular dynamics simulation.
The catalytic site is located in a groove surrounded by two loops.
The distance between these loops fluctuated during the simulations,
which suggests that the groove forms a hinge with a variable opening,
which is able to accommodate the various sizes of LOX substrates.
This 3D model is a pre-requisite to perform docking experiments with
LOX substrates and other partners to identify binding sites and to
design new LOX inhibitors specific for therapeutic purpose.

==== Body
Introduction
Lysyl oxidase (LOX),
also known as protein-lysine 6-oxidase (EC
1.4.3.13), is a copper-dependent amine oxidase. It catalyzes the oxidative
deamination of specific lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues in collagens
and elastin, which is the first step of the covalent cross-linking
of these extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.1,2 Human
lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a proenzyme of 396 amino acid residues,
processed by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) and mammalian tolloids.
These enzymes release the active form of LOX (∼32 kDa)3 and its N-terminal propeptide (147 residues).
The propeptide, which is extended and flexible, has been shown to
interact with 34 partners,4 is required
for LOX to exit the endoplasmic reticulum,5 and plays other biological roles including a ras recision
gene activity,6 which categorizes
it as a matricryptin.7,8 LOX contains five disulfide bridges,9 a copper ion and a lysine tyrosylquinone cofactor,10,11 which is formed autocatalytically in presence of a copper ion12 and cross-links the residues K320 and Y355 in
the human enzyme. LOX shares its catalytic domain with four lysyl
oxidase-like proteins (LOXL1–LOXL4), but only LOXL1 contains
a propeptide, which is cleaved by BMP-1.13 LOXL2–LOXL4 contain four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich
(SRCR) domains at their N-terminus. Active LOX has been detected in
the nuclei of fibroblasts, where it may act on histones.14,15 Other non-ECM substrates of LOX include fibroblast growth factor-216 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
β.17

LOX plays a major role
in the development of the cardiovascular
and respiratory systems as shown in Lox–/– mice, which develop aortic aneurysms.18 Human LOX mutations (T248I, Q267P, S280R, M298R, and S348R, Figure 1) also predispose
to aortic aneurysms and dissections in humans.19,20 Besides its role in ECM assembly and architecture, LOX is overexpressed
under hypoxia and is involved in cancer progression and metastasis,
particularly in breast cancer metastasis to the bone through the formation
of a metastatic niche.21−24 LOX is upregulated in adipose tissue with obesity25 and in fibrosis.26−28 Targeting LOX in fibrosis and
cancer may thus be a new therapeutic approach in these diseases.23,29−31 β-Aminopropionitrile is a potent inhibitor
of LOX activity, but its toxicity limits its use as a drug.

The design of new inhibitors of LOX catalytic activity and/or
of
specific interaction of LOX with one of its partners requires the
knowledge of the 3D structure of LOX, which has not been determined
so far, although the enzyme has been discovered 50 years ago.32 However, LOX becomes highly insoluble upon enzymatic
release from the prolysyl oxidase and is thus very difficult to express
in a soluble form and in sufficient amount for structural studies
using X-ray crystallography and/or NMR spectroscopy.6 Two high-resolution crystal structures of Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase (PPLO) are available
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org; PDB IDs: 1N9E(33) and 1W7C(34)), but PPLO
is dimeric and contains a topaquinone cofactor (TPQ), whereas human
LOX is monomeric and has a lysine tyrosylquinone cofactor. PPLO is
thus not a good enough template for the homology modeling of human
LOX. Two in silico models of human LOX have been published, but they
do not include and/or do not fit to all the experimental molecular
and structural data available for LOX.35,36 A third model
encompasses only a short sequence of human LOX (residues Y284-F301)
and focuses on the copper-coordination site.37 The publication of the X-ray structure of human LOXL238 prompted us to use it as a template to generate
a 3D model of human LOX including the copper-binding site, the LTQ
cofactor, and the five disulfide bridges. Indeed, the sequences of
human LOX and LOXL2 catalytic domains share 49% of sequence identity.
The resulting model fits well to all biochemical and structural information
available. The stability of the model was then assessed by a long
molecular dynamics simulation (1 μs).

Results
Sequence Analysis
of Human Mature Lysyl Oxidase
The
percentages of α-helices and β-strands predicted in the
sequence of human LOX were 17 and 18%, respectively, and the percentage
of random coil was 65% (Figure 1). A sequence of 29 residues enriched in tyrosine residues
and located at the N-terminus and a short sequence of three residues
at the C-terminus were predicted to be intrinsically disordered (Figure 1).

Prediction
of Molecular Recognition Features and Protein-Binding
Regions
According to MoRFchibi SYSTEM, the D169-P195 and
R198-Y203 sequences of LOX would be able to undergo a disorder-to-order
transition upon binding to its partners. The intrinsically disordered
sequence 181NPYYNYYD188 located at the N-terminus
of LOX was also predicted by ANCHOR to be able to fold upon binding.
This sequence is present in bovine, chicken, human, murine, and rat
LOX and was also found in unreviewed UniProtKB entries of LOX using
BLAST but not in other proteins. It thus appears to be specific of
LOX.

Homology Modeling of Lysyl Oxidase
The first 3D structure
of a member of the LOX family, human LOXL2, has been recently published.38 The sequence of the catalytic domain of human
LOXL2 (P548-S751) shares 49% of identity with that of human LOX (P213-Y417),
which allowed us to build a 3D model of LOX by homology modeling.
Ten thousand models were generated with the comparative modeling protocol
of Rosetta39 including the copper ion and
the lysine tyrosylquinone cofactor. The coordination site of the copper
ion was restrained by harmonic potential between the Cβ of histidine
residues involved in copper ion coordination. A harmonic potential
was also applied between the nitrogen atom of K320 and the oxygen
atom of Y355. The flat bottom of these potentials was defined by the
distance observed in the X-ray structures of LOXL2 (PDB ID: 5ZE3) and of lysyl oxidase
from P. pastoris (PDB IDs: 1N9E and 1W7C).

Both LOX
and LOXL2 contain 10 conserved cysteine residues in their catalytic
domain, namely, C238-C244, C291-C340, C324-C330, C351-C361, and C398-C412
for LOX,9 and C663-C685, C673-C657, C579-C695,
C625-C573, and C732-C746 for LOXL2,38 but
they are paired differently except for one of them (Figure S1).

Four out of the 5 disulfide bonds of LOX
were formed during the
first step of modeling using Rosetta. The C291-C340 disulfide bridge
was not formed at this stage indeed. The sequence encompassing the
catalytic domain of LOX (residues P213-Y417) shared a common architecture
with the catalytic domain of LOXL2 (residues P548-S751; maximum RMSD
Cα: 1.75 Å) (Figure 2A). The C291-C340 disulfide bridge could lock/constrain the
bottom of the D331-G350 loop of LOX, which corresponds to loop 10
in LOXL2 (Figure 2B).
These conserved cysteine residues are not paired together in the X-ray
structure of LOXL2.

Figure 2 Superimposition of the five best models generated for
the catalytic
domain of LOX (P213-Y417) selected with ProQ2 and of the X-ray structure
of LOXL2 (PDB ID: 5ZE3; P548-S751, in blue). (A) Global view of the catalytic domain and
(B) detailed view of loop 10 (D331-G350 in LOX). The residues involved
in LTQ formation in the X-ray structure of LOXL2 are colored red.
They are too far from each other and are not in the correct orientation
to form the LTQ in the crystal structure of LOXL2.

These best models were then refined with Rosetta
to form the missing
disulfide bridge between C291 and C340. When the five disulfide bridges
of LOX were formed, both the K320 and Y355 were close enough to form
the LTQ cofactor without further external constraints, which is observed
for the first time in a model of this protein. Moreover, these amino
acids were close enough to the Cu2+ coordinated by the
three histidine residues previously identified in LOX (H292, H294,
and H296).26 The LOX model (Figure 3) comprised 9.2% of helices,
18.9% of β-strands, and 71.9% of random coil and turns, as determined
with DSSP (Figure 3A and Table S1). The percentage of random
coil in the model was similar to that predicted in the sequence of
human lysyl oxidase by PROTEUS (65%), which does not discriminate
random coil and turns.

orientations. Orange: copper; green: calcium; red: LTQ; yellow: disulfide
bonds; blue: histidine residues coordinating the copper ion. The calcium
coordination site identified in LOXL2 (D549, L550, E722, D724, N727,
and N728) is conserved in LOX (D214, L215, E388, D390, N393, and N394;
residues in green). (B) Electrostatic potential of the LOX model rendered
on the molecular surface (±10 kT/e, acidic residues in red, basic
residues in blue), without contribution of ions, was generated using
the PDB2PQR server42 (http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr_2.0.0/).

The N-terminal sequence of LOX
encompassing the residues 169–212
differs from that of LOXL2, and the absence of a template prevented
the homology modeling of the N-terminus of LOX. A sequence homologous
to the cytokine receptor class 1 has been identified in the LOX sequence
(residues C351-C412).40 The structural
alignment of the 3D structures of this domain from human erythropoietin
receptor (PDB ID: 1ERN(41)) with our 3D model of LOX presents
a correct overall shape of the domain with a correct superposition
of the β-sheet in the interface with the other domain of the
model (Figure S2).

Coordination of Copper
and Calcium Ions in the LOX Model
LOX and LOXLs are both
copper-dependent enzymes. Restraints were
thus applied on Cu2+ in the LOX model to keep it coordinated
by histidine residues (Nε for H292 and H294 residues
and Nδ for H296 residue) and close from the LTQ.
They were based on data from the copper amine oxidase family33,34 and on the corresponding coordination site in the X-ray structure
of LOXL2, where a zinc ion replaces the copper ion. Furthermore, as
indicated above, a calcium ion, observed in the catalytic site of
LOXL2, was added in the equivalent site of the LOX model. The H292,
H294, and H296 residues coordinating the copper ion and the LTQ cofactor
were obtained in a coherent structural environment with the copper
ion and the oxygen atom of the quinone (Figure 4A). No positional restraint was applied to
the histidine residue H303, which might be involved in the catalytic
mechanism of the enzyme,43 because the
corresponding histidine residue in LOXL2 (H637) is not in the first
coordination shell of the zinc ion (dZn-H637 = 14.8 Å). The simulations
revealed that this histidine residue had no structural influence.
There were no well-defined cationic patches on the surface of LOX
model. However, two anionic clusters were observed, one of them containing
the residues coordinating the calcium ion (Figure 3B). The calcium ion was accessible on the
model surface of the model (Figure 4B), in contrast to the copper ion, which is buried
inside the model (Figure 3B). This is consistent with the experimental data indicating
that the copper ion is tightly bound to the protein.44

histidine residues coordinating the copper ion and the LTQ cofactor

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To evaluate the dynamics
and stability of the 3D model of LOX, molecular dynamics simulations
were performed for a total trajectory of 1 μs. A deviation from
the initial LOX model was observed during the first 300 ns of the
simulation (RMSD Cα: 5.02 ± 0.41 Å, Figure 5A). The largest deviation from
the initial model was observed between residues D169 and P213, corresponding
to the LOX sequence for which no template was available in LOXL2 (data
not shown). The distance between the Cα of D169, located at
the N-terminus of LOX, and the geometric center of the Cα of
the amino acid residues of the LOX sequence (P213-Y417) varied significantly
(20.4 ± 4.6 Å) during the first 300 ns of the simulation,
but the model was more stable afterward (9.5 ± 0.8 Å) (Figure 5B).

Figure 5 (A) Variation of the
RMSD measured on the Cα during the simulation.
(B) Distance between the Cα of D169, located at the N-terminus
of LOX, and the geometric center of the Cα of the amino acid
residues of the sequence of LOX (P213-Y417) during the simulation.

The RMSD was smaller (Cα
= 1.98 ± 0.54 Å) during
the last 600 ns of the simulation using the 400 ns snapshot as a reference
(Figure S3). In addition, two structural
states of the model were observed during this part of the simulation.
These two states were also observed when plotting the distribution
of the distance between the S232-H259 and Q272-F301 loops, located
at the entrance of LOX catalytic site, as a function of the Cα-RMSD
over the last 600 ns of the simulation (Figure S4).

The proportion of secondary structures, calculated
with DSSP, did
not vary significantly during the simulation (Figure S5). The sequences forming β-strands remained
very stable over the stimulation. The major fluctuations took place
in the N-terminal sequence, which forms either α-helices or
turns in the course of the simulation, consistent with the fact that
the N-terminus of LOX is enriched in intrinsic disorder as predicted
by metaPrDOS and is thus flexible. The two major coiled regions (189–199
and 319–329 residues) did not form any secondary structure
during the simulation. The lack of formation of the secondary structure
in the sequence 319–329 during the simulation is consistent
with the disulfide bridge connecting the cysteine residue 324 with
the cysteine residue 330 and the presence of the lysine residue 320
involved in the formation of the LTQ, which both restrain the motion
of this sequence. However, the average content of helices (12%), β-strands
(23%), and random coil and turns (65%) was higher than those calculated
before the simulation.

The general dynamics of the 3D LOX model
was compared to the X-ray
temperature factor of the LOXL2 structure (Figure 6). The fluctuations were evaluated during
the last 700 ns of the simulations, where the LOX model was the most
stable. The data generated for LOX and LOXL2 were very similar. The
fluctuations observed during the MD simulations of the LOX model followed
the same trend than those of the B-factor profile for residues 230–300
and 325–360 (Figure 6). The difference in cysteine pairing between LOX and LOXL2
could contribute to the differences in fluctuations.

profile of the X-ray structure of LOXL2
(residues T546-A721, blue) with the fluctuations of the LOX model
(residues L212-Y408, red) during the trajectory.

Molecular dynamics was performed in the presence of one copper
ion, one calcium ion, and five potassium ions. All the residues involved
in calcium and potassium coordination are conserved in LOX through
evolution (250 sequences retrieved from UniRef9045) (Figure S6). The coordination
sphere and the amino acid residues coordinating the ions were evaluated
with a radial distribution function.46 The
copper coordination sphere was defined by 2.45 and 4.4 Å distances
(Figure 7A), in agreement
with expected values, and adopted an octahedral geometry (Figure S9). The coordination number associated
with the first coordination shell was 5.9 (Table S4). The coordination sphere of the copper ion was defined
by the LTQ, H292, H294, and H296 residues. Although all these residues
were constrained to coordinate the copper ion (Figure 7B), the H296 residue did not interact directly
with the copper ion but stabilized a water molecule involved in the
copper coordination sphere (Figure S9).

sphere of the copper, calcium, and potassium ions

and (D) potassium ion. The matrix distance was calculated for the
whole simulation for the copper and calcium ions (B and C) and was
focused on the last 130 ns of the MD simulation for the potassium
ion.

The calcium coordination distance
was 2.60 Å (Figure 7A), the coordination number
was 8 (Table S4), and the coordination
sphere had an atypical square antiprismatic molecular geometry (Figure S9), which has been described in a bacterial
collagen-binding domain.47 The calcium
ion remained located within the coordination site constituted by the
residues D214, L215, E388, D390, and N394 during the simulation. Its
residence time was evaluated during the entire simulation and was
found to be 99.96% for D214, 99.81% for L215, 100% for E388, 99.87%
for D390, and 58.41% for N394 (Figure 7C).

The coordination distance was 2.74 Å
for the potassium ion,
with a small contribution of the second sphere at 4.5 Å (Figure 7A). During the last
130 ns of production, the potassium ion bound to LOX via L325 (82.86%),
D327 (94.00%), H343 (61.19%), G346 (80.86%), and S348 (55.96%) residues
(Figure 7D). The potassium
ion interacted with L325, G346, and S348 via the backbone and with
D327 and H343 via their side chains (Figure S9). The coordination sphere of the potassium ion adopted a dodecahedral
geometry (Figure S9), and the coordination
number of potassium ion was 7.5 (Table S4). The number of coordination is high for a potassium ion since the
usual coordination number is 6. However, this site identified in the
last 130 ns of the simulation could be occupied in vivo by another
cation (e.g., a divalent cation such as calcium).

The catalytic
site is located in a groove surrounded by two loops,
S232-H259 and Q272-F301, leading to a V shape of the catalytic site.
The distance between the above loops was measured during MD simulations
to follow the accessibility of the catalytic site. The distance between
them fluctuated from 4.8 to 14.2 Å, suggesting that the two structural
states identified during the last 600 ns of the simulation correspond
to an open state and a closed state. To better characterize the groove
opening, essential dynamics was performed on the last 600 ns of the
simulation over the backbone (Cα) of the catalytic domain based
on the Cα-RMSD to extract the correlated motions of LOX and
to determine the motions that are important for its activity. The
analysis of the first 25 principal components (PC) showed that the
first six eigenvectors accounted for 80% of the global motion of LOX
(Figure S7). To characterize the motion
between the open and closed states using these eigenvectors, the corresponding
structural motion was further investigated. The contribution of each
of the six eigenvectors to the residue fluctuations showed that both
PC1 and PC3 are responsible for the opening motion. The PC3 characterized
the large motion of the loop S232-H259 (Figure 8). This suggests that the groove forms a
hinge with a variable opening, which could accommodate various sizes
of substrates in agreement with the known enzymatic activity of LOX
on small (e.g., FGF2) and large (e.g., collagens) proteins. The maximum
opening of the groove (Figure 8) was consistent with the diameter of a collagen molecule
(∼15 Å including side chains; PDB ID: 2KLW). When considering
the motions observed in the trajectories, the H303 residue, which
might act as a base during the catalytic process,43 appeared to be positioned at the bottom of the groove and
might be activated whatever the groove opening.

Discussion
This model is the first one to recapitulate
all known molecular
features of human mature LOX, namely, copper coordination residues,
the LTQ cofactor, and the five disulfide bridges. Indeed, disulfide
bridges were not included in both in silico models previously published.
Kagan and Ryvkin’s model35 was built
with Schrödinger, Inc. Molecular Modeling Software using sequence
alignments and secondary structure prediction, and contained the copper
ion and the LTQ. However, in this model the LTQ is located at 20 Å
from the copper ion, which is at odds with its redox role during the
catalytic process. Furthermore, Kagan and Ryvkin did not perform molecular
dynamics simulations to assess the structural stability of their model.
The second published model36 was built
ab initio with the Robetta server and refined with MAESTRO 9.3 but
does not contain the LTQ cofactor.36 A
very short dynamics simulation (4 ns) was performed, but it was not
sufficient to evaluate the stability of the proposed model, and the
fluctuations during the trajectory were not reported.

Furthermore,
it is difficult to compare the content in secondary
structures and random coils of our model with Kagan and Ryvkin’s
model because the total amount of secondary structures of their model
was higher than 100% (110%: 20% α-helices, 25% β-strands,
65% random coil, and turns). On the other hand, our model contains
less secondary structures than Bhuvanasundar’s model36 (24 and 25% of α-helices and β-strands,
respectively, for their model versus 9.2 and 18.9% of α-helices
and β-strands, respectively, for our model). The values calculated
from the deconvolution of circular dichroism spectra of human LOX
are twice higher than in our model for α-helices (21%) and in
the same range for β-strands26 (27.5%).
Our 3D model contains approximately 69% of random coil and turns,
in agreement with the amount of disorder and turns predicted by PROTEUS
(65%), but it is higher than the amount of random coil calculated
by circular dichroism (52%).26 The N-terminal
sequence NPYYNYYD, predicted as intrinsically disordered, is indeed
disordered in the 3D model. This sequence is only found in LOX and
not in LOX-like proteins and might be involved in specific interactions
of LOX with unique substrate and/or nonsubstrate proteins.

A
calcium binding site, identified in human LOXL2, is conserved
in human LOX, and it is located at a distance from the catalytic site.
Several LOX binding partners and substrates are calcium-binding proteins
(e.g., elastin, fibulin-5, bone morphogenetic protein-1, tolloid-like
protein 1, perlecan, and fibrillin-1) or play a role in calcium homeostasis
(stanniocalcin 2). The calcium-binding site of LOX could tether these
substrates to the LOX surface and position them in an appropriate
orientation to be oxidatively deaminated within the catalytic site.
The effect of calcium on LOX enzymatic and/or biological activities
has to be investigated. The calcium ion remained stable during the
1 μs MD trajectory and might contribute locally to the stability
of the model. It should be noted that loop 10 became closer to the
calcium coordination site after 600 ns of simulation, but its position
fluctuates during the last part of the simulation.

The T248I,
S280R, and S348R mutants, which predispose to aortic
aneurysms and dissections in humans19,20 and are the
most distant from the catalytic site, inhibit the activity of LOX
to a lesser extent than the M298 mutant,19,20 which is closer to the catalytic site and abolishes LOX activity
(Figure 9). However,
the mutation of the S348 residue, which is located at the bottom of
the groove, decreases the activity by 50%,19 emphasizing the potential role of the groove in the catalytic mechanism.
In the vicinity of this residue, a potassium ion is observed in the
first sphere of coordination (2.74 Å, during 56% of the last
130 ns of the trajectory). The serine-to-arginine mutation, replacing
a polar amino acid by a longer, positively charged residue, could
lead to the loss of potassium or any other cation and may be important
for the activity of the LOX.

We used MAESTRO, a Multi Agent Stability Prediction tool,
for changes
in unfolding free energy upon point mutation (https://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/maestro/web)48,49 to predict the stability change expressed
as ΔΔG induced by the mutations. MAESTRO
accepts 3D models as an input. All the mutations, T248I, Q267P, M298R
and S348R, destabilize the protein. M298R, which lacks significant
enzyme activity, has the strongest destabilizing effect (Table S2), whereas the destabilizing effects
of T248I and S348R, which decreases LOX activity by 8 and 21%,19 are less pronounced. The only discrepancy in
mutation analysis concerns the S280R mutation, which is predicted
to stabilize the protein and is located at a higher distance from
the copper ion and LTQ than the other mutated amino acid residues
(Tables S2 and S3), although it decreases
the enzyme activity by 50%. However, no role has been reported for
this serine residue in the catalytic mechanism.

As mentioned
above, potassium ions were added in the simulation
to perform simulations in neutral condition. After 750 ns, one of
the potassium ions was stabilized in a cleft of coiled parts of the
enzyme and remained here until the end of the trajectory. This potassium
ion seems to play a key role in the local stabilization of this flexible
part of the 3D structure.

The model of the human LOX reported
here is the first one to include
the five disulfide bridges stabilizing its tertiary structure, as
well as the copper ion and the LTQ cofactor, both of which are required
for its enzymatic activity,26 whereas the
only crystal structure available for a member of the mammalian LOX
family does not contain the LTQ cofactor and copper ion and represents
a zinc-bound precursor state requiring conformational changes for
its activation.38 Numerical simulations
taking into account all these molecular characteristics were performed
in a solvated environment, leading to a long trajectory of 1 μs.
The stability of the overall 3D structure was conserved along the
trajectory. The secondary structure elements were also stable during
the simulations. The content in secondary structures may require optimization,
but it does not significantly influence the global fold of our model.
The nonstructured parts provide LOX with the structural flexibility
and dynamics required for its adaptation to substrates of various
sizes and shapes, from growth factors to collagen fibrils. The LTQ
remains in a correct position during the simulation, acting as a “bottom
floor” in the inner core of the protein, and is crucial for
the coordination of the copper ion. The copper ion and the three histidine
residues are also correctly positioned during the whole simulations.
The solvation of the groove, where there are numerous water molecules,
will be of interest for structural studies of complexes formed by
LOX with its natural substrates.

The disulfide pattern of the
LOX model differs from the pattern
observed in the X-ray structure of LOXL2. Only one of the five disulfide
bonds was conserved. We generated an alternative model of LOX with
Swiss-Model50 using the X-ray structure
of LOXL2 as a template to determine the influence of the cysteine
pairing pattern on the folding of LOX. The fold of this homology model
containing the disulfide pattern of LOXL2 was similar to the fold
of the dynamic model of LOX (RMSD =3.4 Å, Figure S8). Both models had common secondary structures, although
the homology model contained few extra helix-forming residues and
three to four further short β-strands (Figure S8 and Table S1). The residues involved in the LTQ formation
are not close enough and not well oriented in the homology model to
allow the formation of the cofactor. Although the pattern of LOXL2
disulfide bonds is plausible for LOX, it does not allow the formation
of the LTQ cofactor, whereas the pattern of LOX disulfide bonds allows
the formation of LTQ. This is in agreement with the fact that high-similarity
proteins do not necessarily share the same connectivity patterns of
cysteine residues, as shown for scorpion toxins.51 Scorpion toxins MTX and Pi4 have a high sequence identity
(81.6%) and the same number of cysteine residues but different connectivity
patterns, whereas scorpion toxins BMTX1 and LpII have a low sequence
identity (21%) but share an identical cysteine pairing pattern.51 It should be noted that the X-ray structure
of LOXL2 represents a zinc-bound precursor state according to the
authors. Pronounced conformational rearrangements would be required
for protein activation,38 and this may
include the reshuffling of disulfide bonds. It is thus likely that
our model of LOX and the crystal structure of LOXL2 represent different
states, namely, a potentially active state of LOX for our model and
a nonfunctional, inactive precursor state for the X-ray structure
of LOXL2.

Conclusions
We have built the first 3D model of human
LOX encompassing all
the major features required for its enzymatic activity (the LTQ cofactor
and coordination site of the copper ion) and the five disulfide bridges
stabilizing its 3D structure. This enzyme, known for several decades,
is implicated in numerous biochemical and physiopathological processes,
but its 3D structure was never solved at the atomic level by crystallography
or NMR. The model proposed in this work takes into account all the
different structural features in the literature and is consistent
with the few experimental biophysical and structural information reported
in the literature. If some of the secondary structures have to be
refined in the model, the coil parts of the protein seem to be important
to allow the plasticity and, consequently, the function of the enzyme.
The long simulations performed have proved the stability of the built
model, and the dynamical features are consistent with the known functions
of LOX. This model will be useful to perform docking experiments with
substrates and other binding partners to decipher the molecular mechanisms
governing these interactions. This model will be also useful for docking
small molecules potentially acting as LOX inhibitors. It will be useful
to design new inhibitors specific of LOX for therapeutic purpose.

Material
and Methods
Prediction of Secondary Structure and Intrinsic Disorder of
Human LOX
The secondary structure of human LOX (UniProtKB
accession number P28300) was predicted with PROTEUS Structure Prediction
Server 2.052 (http://www.proteus2.ca/proteus/index.jsp).

Intrinsic disordered regions were predicted using metaPrDOS,
combining DISOPRED2, DISPROT, IUPred, and PrDOS predictors with a
ROC score of 0.897.53 Disordered regions
of LOX that were able to undergo disorder-to-order transition upon
binding to its partners were predicted with ANCHOR54,55 (https://iupred2a.elte.hu/), and Molecular Recognition Features
(MoRFs) were predicted using MoRFchibi SYSTEM56 (https://gsponerlab.msl.ubc.ca/software/morf_chibi/).

The
Multi Agent Stability Prediction (MAESTRO, https://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/maestro/web/)48,49 tool for changes in unfolding free energy
upon point mutation was used to evaluate the effect of mutations found
in patients on the stability of lysyl oxidase (MAESTRO provides ΔΔG values with prediction quality measures.

Homology Modeling
of Human Lysyl Oxidase
Several approaches
including data reported in the literature were used to build a 3D
model of human LOX. To generate the LOX model, we used Rosetta software,
allowing us to combine both threading and comparative modeling approaches
through the RosettaCM protocol.39 For the
threading approach, fragment libraries of three and nine amino residues
(371 and 2373 fragments, respectively) were built using the Robetta
server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/).57 The best templates for comparative
approach were identified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) against the PDB, with the LOXL2 X-ray structure having been
recently solved (PDB ID: 5ZE3(38)).

HHpred58,59 (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhpred) was used to retrieve distant homologs of the human lysyl oxidase
sequence (residues 169–417) based on hidden Markov models (HMMs).
Rosetta39 was then used with the RosettaCM
procedure (Comparative Modeling) to generate 10,000 models based on
the Robetta fragment libraries, the catalytic domain of human LOXL238 (PDB ID: 5ZE3) (residues 548–751 corresponding
to the LOXL domain annotated in UniProtKB), and the structural data
available, namely, a copper ion coordinated by H292, H294, and H296
residues, the cofactor LTQ involving K320 and Y355, and five disulfide
bonds (C238-C244, C291-C340, C324-C330, C351-C361, and C398-C412).9

The distance between the atoms of the residues
forming the LTQ,
namely, the nitrogen atom of K320 side chain and the oxygen atom of
Y355 side chain, was constrained by a harmonic potential to keep it
closer to 5 Å. The LOX model was fitted to the catalytic site
of the LOXL2 template on the Cβ of the three histidine residues
coordinating the copper ion and on the Cα of the lysine and
tyrosine residues forming the LTQ cofactor issued from the X-ray structure
of the D298K mutant of the copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis (PDB ID: 2YX9(60)). This enzyme was used as a template to generate the LTQ
because the copper-binding site of LOXL2 is occupied by zinc in the
X-ray structure, which prevents the formation of a LTQ. Furthermore,
the copper amine oxidase from A. globiformis is the only structure available in the PDB, which contains a LTQ
cofactor. The D331-G350 sequence of LOX, aligned with the loop 10
of LOXL2, was refined with Rosetta script on the 10 best templates
evaluated with ProQ2 assessment program61 to allow the formation of the C291-C340 disulfide bridge, which
was not formed during the first step of modeling, although it was
given as a constraint to Rosetta. The atomic coordinates of the final
model of human lysyl oxidase is provided in the Supporting Information.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Starting from this model,
the structure was minimized using a classical protocol to remove the
remaining steric clashes. The system was embedded into a TIP3P (transferable
intermolecular potential with 3 points) water box in minimum salt
(9.2, 7.3, and 8.2 nm, 16,899 water molecules, 5 K+ for
a neutral system).62 The whole hydrated
system was successively minimized, simulated for a short 500 ps trajectory
at a constant volume and temperature (310 K), and further simulated
during 200 ps under constant pressure and temperature (310 K). The
V-rescale thermostat63 was, used and all
the protein heavy atoms were fixed during these two steps. The resulting
system was used as the starting point for 1 μs production runs.

The simulations were performed using Gromacs software,64 with the amber99SB-ildn*-q force field65−67 including modified parameters for copper ions.68 Simulations were performed at a constant temperature (310
K) with V-rescale thermostat63 and pressure
(1 bar) using a Parrinello–Rahman coupling algorithm.69 The integration time step was 2 fs, and all
bonds were constrained using P-LINCS.70 Water molecules were kept rigid using the SETTLE algorithm.71 Lennard–Jones interactions were cut off
at 1.0 nm. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using
the Particle Mesh Ewald approach72 with
a 1.0 nm direct space cut-off. The neighbor list was updated every
10 ps, and the center-of-mass motion was removed at every step. To
keep the copper ion correctly coordinated, distance restraints were
applied between H292, H294, and H296 coordinating the copper ion,
K320 and Y355 forming the LTQ, and the copper ion (3.5 Å with
the Nε of H292 and H294 residues and Nδ for the H296 residue and 5 Å with the oxygen atom of LTQ).
A calcium ion was added in the LOX model because the crystal structure
of the LOXL2 template contains a calcium ion and the six amino acid
residues coordinating the calcium ion in LOXL2 (D549, L550, E722,
D724, N727, and N728)38 are all conserved
in the corresponding LOX sequence (D214, L215, E388, D390, N393, and
N394). Subsequently, 1 μs production runs were carried out.
The essential dynamics was realized on the last 600 ns of simulation
and only on Cα atoms of LOX (P213-Y417). All structures were
visualized using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD, http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).73
