The
low-lying excited states of thiophene-based cyclic oligomer
tetrathia[22]annulene[2,1,2,1] (TTA) are studied using the density
matrix renormalization group technique within long-range Pariser–Parr–Pople
(PPP) model Hamiltonian. The calculated lowest singlet dipole-allowed
excited state S1 (optical gap) is at 1.76 eV for TTA which
is in very good agreement with experiment (1.6 eV), and therefore
it is found to be promising in harvesting the visible to near-infrared
region of the solar spectrum. The calculated diradical character of
TTA and the lowest triplet to lowest singlet (T1/S1) ratio (0.12) in TTA obtained within the model PPP Hamiltonian
suggest TTA to be a promising singlet fission material. Donor–acceptor
(D–A) substitution in TTA also modulates the optical gap from
1.76 to 1.35 eV rendering (D–A)-substituted TTA applicable
in organic light-emitting devices.

Introduction
Organic conjugated systems attract strong
attention as they are
promising in the field of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Oligothiophenes
are suitable candidates for diverse technological applications, such
as light-emitting diodes, plastic lasers, field effect transistors,
and photovoltaic cells.1−13 Thiophene-based conjugated systems are in demand in developing high-performance
organic solar cells (SCs) because of their excellent light-harvesting,
structural versatility, and intrinsic charge-transport properties.14 Such conjugated systems serve the purpose of
active materials in photovoltaic devices with well-defined molecular
architectures ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional. Thiophene-based
molecular structures and their light-harvesting properties are a key
matter of interest in recent times in designing solar cells (SC).
Conjugated polymers with low band gap (<2 eV) that absorb solar
radiation extending into red and near-infrared (NIR) regions are highly
desirable in this respect. Therefore, optical band gap and frontier-orbital
energy levels of donor-conjugated molecules play an important role
in device performance. For single junction SC, an optical band gap
of about 1.3–1.7 eV is expected to be optimal.15,16 Cyclic conjugated porphyrins and phthalocyanine molecules are promising
light-harvesting materials and used in SC devices as donor materials.17,18 Similar to porphyrin analogues, cyclic oligothiophenes are important
due to their unique optoelectrical and self-assembling properties.19,20 The charge-transport properties in cyclic conjugated systems can
be significantly improved, as reorganization energy in cyclic geometry
is reduced as compared to their linear counterparts. Moreover, cyclic
conjugated systems have excellent characteristics of well-defined
structure and infinite π conjugation excluding perturbing end
effects imposed by the end functional groups attached to the linear
oligomers. Conjugated cyclo[n]thiophenes are fascinating
organic semiconductors (OSCs) with excellent optical and self-assembling
properties.21,22 Thiophene-based cyclic oligomer
tetrathia[22]annulene[2,1,2,1] (TTA) has been reported to possess
good p-type semiconducting properties in field-effect transistors
having hole mobility up to 0.05 cm2 V–1 S–1 and on/off ratio above 103.23 The degree of conjugation in the TTA molecule
is expected to be high to increase the intermolecular π–π
conjugation. Later, TTA has been reported as the first cyclic thiophene-based
molecule used as the active layer in the OSC device. Despite the success
of TTA for application in organic electronics in the experiment, cyclic
thiophene-based molecules have not been investigated extensively from
the theoretical point of view. Moreover, there are very few theoretical
investigations on cyclic thiophene-based macrocycles.24,25 Theoretical investigation showed that smaller cyclic oligothiophenes
having a syn-conformation are more stable than those having an anti-conformation;
on the other hand, for larger cyclic oligothiophenes, the reverse
is true.24 In the case of the syn-conformation
of cyclic oligothiophene, the frontier-orbital energy gap cannot be
related to system size, which is present in the case of anti-conformation.

Low-lying singlet and triplet excited states energy ordering is
very important to explain the photophysical properties that these
molecules possess. Electron–electron correlation has a strong
impact in regulating the singlet to triplet energy ordering. In this
paper, we are investigating the low-lying energy ordering of TTA in
singlet and triplet subspaces to investigate its effect in photophysical
properties.

In most of the conjugated systems, energy ordering
of the lowest
triplet state (T1) relative to the first-dipole-allowed
excited singlet state (S1) is very important in the field
of optoelectronics in two different aspects. In the field of organic
light-emitting devices (OLEDs), recombination of an electron and hole
yields 75% triplet and 25% singlet excitons in a noninteracting limit.
If the magnitude of the energy difference between S1 and
T1 is nearly of the order of KBT, triplet to singlet population transfer can be achieved through
reverse intersystem crossing thermally. In this way, the efficiency
of OLEDs can be improved. On the other hand, photoelectric power conversion
efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices can be enhanced by the
process of including singlet fission (SF) materials or molecular chromophores,
where after absorption of a single photon, one singlet exciton splits
into two triplet excitons. SF is a spin-allowed process, where a singlet
excited molecule shares its energy with the ground state (gs) of its
neighboring molecule to produce two triplet excitons. Triplet excitons
are preferable to singlet excitons due to longer lifetime and elongated
diffusion length.26 SF is observed in the
single crystal, polycrystalline, and amorphous solids on time scales
from 80 fs to 20 ps producing triplet yields of nearly 200%. In this
way, the SF mechanism can help in achieving the Shockley–Queisser
photoelectric conversion limit (30%) for singlet junction solar cell
efficiency.27,28 The following energy level conditions
have to be satisfied for an isolated single molecule to undergo SF.29 1   2  The first
condition is required to split singlet
exciton (S1) into two triplet excitons (T1).
The second one is essential to prevent further recombination of two
triplets (T1) into S0 and T2 states.
Such an SF process does not consider molecular geometrical relaxation,
nonadiabatic transition, and intermolecular interaction.29−32 In other words, the E(T1)/E(S1) ratio should be less than 0.5 to support the idea
of SF.40 Earlier research on polyacence
crystals shows that for pentacene crystal, SF is a spontaneous process
as E(S1) > 2E(T1).33−37 In contrast, in the case of tetracene, SF is a thermally activated
process, as E(S1) is comparatively lesser
than 2E(T1).38,39

In this work, we calculated the ground and low-lying singlet
and
triplet excited states of the cyclic thiophene-based TTA monomer to
investigate their potential application in optoelectronics within
the model Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian approach.
We employed the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique
to study those low-lying excited states of TTA. The DMRG calculation
has been carried out on the ground state structure of TTA optimized
within density functional theory (DFT). The low-lying excited state
energies using DMRG are then compared with experiment and time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) results. The calculation on the
TTA monomer showed that they possess low optical gap suitable for
harvesting solar energy from the visible to NIR region. We also calculated
the low-lying excitations of donor–acceptor (D–A)-substituted
TTA. The effect of D–A substitution in these systems modulates
singlet and triplet excitations, and the variation of S1–T1 energy gap has been calculated as a function
of D–A strength (ϵ). Molecules possessing diradical character
are expected to show the SF mechanism. In this respect, along with
low-lying excitations, we also calculated the multiple diradical characters,
namely y0, y1, which describe the strength of the chemical bonds. The values of
(y0, y1) represented
by (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, 1) are described as closed-shell, pure
diradical, and pure tetradiradical species, respectively.

Results and Discussion
To have confidence in the DMRG scheme, we calculated ground state
energies for the noninteracting Huckel model using DMRG and compared
those results with the exact Huckel molecular orbital (HMO) calculation
for the TTA monomer. The ground state raw energy for TTA in the DMRG
scheme is −142.0989 eV, which is in very good agreement with
the exact calculation value of −142.9591 eV. The density matrix
eigen vector (DMEV) basis is kept as 500 for the above calculation.
The difference in the energy gap between HMO and DMRG is less than
1 eV. The ground and low-lying excited states for the above systems
are calculated for correlated PPP model Hamiltonian, keeping the DMEV
basis to be 500 for TTA. We first summarized the five low-lying singlet
excited states in A and B subspaces in Table 1 for TTA. The ground state (gs) singlet 11A (S0) energy is set to zero, and the excitation
energies have been tabulated with respect to gs in Table 1. In experiment, UV–vis
absorption spectra of TTA showed several weak absorption peaks at
comparatively longer wavelengths 771(1.6), 579(2.14), 540(2.29), and
503(2.46) nm(eV) and an intense maximum at 417 (2.97) nm(eV).41 The calculated lowest singlet dipole-allowed
excitation (11B) is 1.76 eV, which is in very good agreement
with the absorption at 1.6 eV in the experiment. The transition dipole
moment probability of the lowest singlet state (11B) with
respect to the most intense excited state calculated is 0.1, which
is in very good agreement with the experimental observation of 0.1.
The lowest singlet dipole-allowed state (11B) is also termed
as the one-photon state in the literature. This energy gap of the
11B state with respect to gs S0 is termed as
the optical gap. The excitation energies of 21B and 31B states are 3.15 and 3.38 eV, respectively. The corresponding
transition dipole moment probabilities are shown in parentheses. The
ground state to 31B transition (3.38 eV) shows a maximum
transition dipole moment in the calculation with the maximum probability
depicted in the parentheses. Such transition is in good agreement
with highly intense absorption at 2.97 eV in the experiment.41 Singlet excited states also involve excitations
that are optically dark. These states are in the same A space symmetry
as the ground state. The calculated 21A and 31A states are, respectively, 1.89 and 3.03 eV for TTA. Therefore,
the optically dark two-photon 21A (1.89 eV) state is nearly
0.13 eV above the lowest-dipole-allowed singlet 11B (1.76
eV), rendering TTA as a fluorescent molecule.

We listed also the low-lying excited states in triplet manifold
in Table 2 for TTA.
The lowest triplet state (T1) for TTA is nearly 0.22 eV
above the ground state. So the spin gap (T1–S0) is very small for TTA. The energy gap between the lowest
triplet and lowest singlet (T1–S1) state
is 1.49 eV from our calculation. The energy ordering of T1 and S1 with respect to gs in TTA is such that the energy
difference between E(S1) (1.76 eV) and
2E(T1) (0.44 eV) is greater (1.32 eV)
than zero; moreover, E(T2) (1.93 eV) is
greater than 2E(T1) (0.44 eV), which helps
in preventing further the triplet–triplet annihilation process
between two chromophores. In this case, the ratio E(T1)/E(S1) is 0.12, which
is far less than 0.5. As E(S1) –
2T1 is comparatively higher (1.32 eV), TTA may find itself
to act as SF with a restriction that the above process is highly exoergic.
In a two-molecule picture, SF is described as 3  The bound triplet pair state 1(T1T1) is expected to be formed at ≥1.32
eV
below the S1(11B) state. The existence and dynamics
of the distinct bound 1(T1T1) state
during SF is addressed in crystalline hexacene by both time-resolved
two-photon photoemission (TR-2PPE) and transient absorption techniques.42 So, from the point of view of energy level matching,
TTA is found to satisfy the fundamental criterion for SF; however,
this process is exoergic in nature. The energy ordering
of dipole-allowed singlet and triplet energy states of TTA is depicted
in Figure 3a and also
reported in Table 1. The lowest singlet state is calculated at 2.07 eV, which is 0.31
eV higher than the PPP result. The strongest singlet excited state
calculated in TDDFT at 3.34 eV is in good agreement with 3.38 eV,
calculated through the PPP model. The strongest absorption maxima
calculated in both model PPP and TDDFT are in good agreement with
the experimental absorption at 2.97 eV. Table 2 also lists the triplet–triplet absorptions
at 2.04 and 2.71 eV, which are relatively very weak. Unfortunately,
we do not have experimental results for triplet energies for TTA to
compare with. The triplet energies listed in Table 2 are calculated through TDDFT based on the
optimized triplet geometry of TTA at CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ. The calculated
lowest triplet state is 1.31 eV, so the E(S1) is 0.55 eV lower than 2T1 so that the SF process is
endoergic according to TDDFT. For efficient SF to occur, it is important
to calculate the diradical character yi that depends on the occupancies of the highest occupied
natural orbital (HONO) and lowest unoccupied natural orbital (LUNO).
We carried out projected unrestricted Hartree–Fock (PUHF) calculation
based on the ground state of the TTA molecule optimized above. The
calculated values of y0 and y1 are 0.37 and 0.23, respectively. The calculated intermediate y0 (0.37) value of TTA also indicates the possibility
of SF occurrence in it.

Electron
Density and Bond Orders of TTA
The atomic
site indices and bond indices are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
We calculated the electron density of the ground state of TTA and
is depicted in Figure 6. At the meso-carbon of α carbon atoms, the
charge density is nearly 1. There is a slight electron density deficiency
on sulfur atoms calculated as 1.78 and 1.85, respectively. The charge
density fluctuations of one-photon, two-photon, and lowest triplet
states with respect to the ground state are depicted in Figure 7. The plot shows that the fluctuation
of charge density in the one-photon excited state on atoms is comparatively
larger than the two-photon state. In the case of the triplet state,
the charge density fluctuation was limited in the middle of the TTA.
The bond orders of the ground and low-lying excited states of TTA
are also calculated in the DMRG scheme. The bond order is defined
as ⟨∑σâi,σ†âj,σ⟩ + H.c. for a bonded pair of atoms at ith
and jth sites. According to Coulson’s formula,
the smaller magnitude of the bond order stands for longer bond length,
whereas larger magnitude stands for shorter bond length.43 Such calculation gives us an idea of the nature
of the bonds. The calculation of bond orders of higher excited states
at the ground state geometry give us an indication of the equilibrium
geometry the excited state may relax into. We plotted the differences
in bond order for one-photon, two-photon, and lowest triplet states
with respect to the ground state shown in Figure 8. The bond order differences in low-lying
excited states are plotted as a function of the bond index shown in Figure 5. The difference
in the bond order of one-photon and two-photon excited states with
respect to gs are similar in nature except for the middle of the molecule.
The meso bonds connected to the thiophene rings become weaker with
respect to gs in one- and two-photon states, whereas in the thiophene
ring, both the Cα–Cβ bond
and C–S bond become stronger with respect to gs. In contrast,
the lowest triplet state (T1) experiences a very slight
change in the bond order. This feature is expected, as the energy
difference between the gs and the lowest triplet state for TTA is
very small (0.22 eV).

Donor–Acceptor-Substituted TTA
The effect of
D–A substitution on low-lying excitations in the TTA molecule
was also investigated assigning the nonzero value of site energy ϵ
shown in Figure 1.
Theoretically, the effect of donor and acceptor groups is simulated
by introducing site or orbital energies at the sites at which these
groups substitute the hydrogen atom. The negative site energy (ϵ)
simulates the acceptor (A) group, whereas the positive value induces
the effect of the donor (D) group. The low-lying singlet excitations
are sensitive to the effect of D–A substitution in conjugated
systems. In Table 3, we tabulated the low-lying excited states as a function of D–A
strength (ϵ) for the TTA molecule. We concentrated on the variation
of the optical gap as a function of |ϵ|. With the increase in
|ϵ|, the optical gap decreases and reaches 1.35 eV at |ϵ|
= 4 eV. So, S1–S0 energy gap experiences
a decrease of nearly 0.42 eV. This indicates that the optical energy
gap can be modulated by donor–acceptor (D–A) substitution
in the TTA molecule. The energy ordering of the lowest singlet state
(S1) to the lowest triplet state (T1) is also
investigated as a function of |ϵ| for TTA. For unsubstituted
TTA, the lowest triplet T1 is lower than the lowest singlet
S1. The S1–T1 energy gap decreases
from 1.54 to 0.88 eV at the strongest D–A strength |ϵ|
= 4 eV. So in this process the S1–T1 experiences
nearly 0.66 eV shift lower in energy. The substitution effect in TTA
also suggests that energy ordering of both S1 and T1 is sensitive to D–A substitution. From the point of
view of solar cell application, (D–A)-substituted TTA can be
applicable to absorb the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum
as its optical energy gap can be modulated. Also, (D–A)-substituted
TTA may find suitable applications in OLEDs as substitution modulates
the S1–T1 energy gap.

Conclusions
The
calculation of ground and low-lying excited states of the tetrathia[22]annulene[2,1,2,1]
(TTA) molecule has been carried out using the DMRG technique within
the model PPP Hamiltonian and compared with TDDFT results. The calculated
lowest singlet excited state (optical gap) in the PPP model is 1.76
eV for TTA is in good agreement with 1.6 eV in the experiment and
thus supports the absorption of the visible to NIR region of the solar
spectrum. The strongest absorption peaks 3.38 and 3.34 eV calculated
within the model PPP and TDDFT are in very good agreement with the
experimental value of 2.97 eV for TTA. The donor–acceptor (D–A)
substitution effect in TTA reduces the optical gap further. Unlike
unsubstituted TTA, the effect of substitution is able to modulate
the energy difference between S1 and T1, and
thus could be a promising candidate in OLED. The calculated value
of diradical character of TTA and its singlet and triplet energy ordering
obtained within the model Hamiltonian approach showed that TTA could
be a promising SF material.

Computational Approach
Implementation of the Density
Matrix Renormalization Group Technique
For the electronic-structure
calculation of correlated one-dimensional
and quasi-one-dimensional systems, the density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) technique is proved to be an effective technique.44,45 For DMRG calculation, the ground state geometries of the TTA monomer
was optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with Dunning’s
correlation consistent double zeta basis set cc-pVDZ and CAM-B3LYP
exchange–correlational functional implemented in Gaussian 09.46 The geometry-optimized TTA monomer is shown
in Figure 1. It contains
four thiophene units connected by six carbon groups as shown in Figure 1. The lone pair of
electrons on the sulfur atom is perpendicular to the plane of the
thiophene unit and participates in π-conjugation. Each carbon
atom in conjugation contributes one electron. So there are 26 orbitals
in conjugation accommodating 30 electrons in TTA. The DMRG technique
has been implemented to target low-lying excited states for the monomer.
We utilized the inherent C2 symmetry of
these systems in the calculation. The conjugated monomer described
by Pariser–Parr–Pople model (PPP) Hamiltonian includes
explicit long-range electron–electron interactions.47,48 The PPP model Hamiltonian is written as 4  where ai,σ†(ai,σ) represents
the creation (annihilation) operator to create (annihilate) a π-electron
in the pz orbital on atom site i with spin σ. The number operator ni = ∑σni,σ provides the total
number of electrons on atom i, ϵi is the site energy, and zi are the local chemical potential considered to be
1 for carbon atom and 2 for heteroatom sulfur since the lone pair
in sulfur is involved in conjugation. The hopping matrix element or
transfer integral between the bonded pair of atoms i and j is given by tij in the above model Hamiltonian. The model Hamiltonian
also includes onsite electron–electron repulsion Ui and long-range intersite Coulomb interaction
potential Vij parametrized
in the Ohno interpolation scheme.49 5  The transfer integrals tij of the thiophene unit have been taken from
the earlier calculation on low-lying excitations in the polythiophene
system with tC–S = 3.0 eV, US = 5 eV, and ϵS = −7.8
eV.50,51 The rest of the transfer integrals of two
adjacent carbon atoms are taken to be 2.4 eV, and onsite Hubbard repulsion
is UC = 11.26 eV for carbon. The PPP Hamiltonian-based
DMRG technique has been successfully and accurately adopted in earlier
correlated electronic structure calculations in conjugated polyenes,
zigzag, armchair polyacences, and porphyrins.52−54 In the beginning,
DMRG calculation starts with a small system of four carbon atoms that
can be fully diagonalizable followed by augmenting the system size
up to the desired structure of TTA. The entire TTA was built up by
adding two sites (atoms) at a time from the interior. The final desired
structure of the TTA molecule has 26 atoms. In Figure 2, we showed schematically the building up
of the TTA molecule in the DMRG scheme. During building up the entire
structure, the molecular C2 symmetry has
been considered. The TTA monomer consists of 26 orbitals in conjugation
with 30 electrons. PPP Hamiltonian conserves the total spin, so the
computational effort will be reduced by targeting only the singlet
excited states employing spin-parity symmetry. The ground state (A)
and the lowest dipole-allowed excited state (B) are in even-spin-parity
subspace, which is a singlet. The dipole-forbidden, two-photon state
2A has also even spin parity. On the other hand, the triplet states
lie in the odd-parity subspace. The average density matrices of A
and B subspaces were used to obtain the eigenvalues in the renormalization
scheme. Later on, we compared the singlet and triplet excited state
energies for TTA calculated through DMRG with time-dependent-density-functional
(TDDFT) results, calculated based on the CAM-B3LYP exchange correlational
functional and Dunning’s correlation consistent double zeta
basis set cc-pVDZ

Calculation of Diradical Character
The diradical character yi is calculated using the Projected
Unrestricted Hartree–Fock (PUHF) method based on the occupancies
at the highest occupied natural orbital (HONO) and the lowest unoccupied
natural orbital (LUNO).55 The TTA structure
is first optimized using UCAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) before carrying PUHF
calculation. In general, yi is defined as 6  where Ti is the spatial overlap integral between HONO – i and LUNO + i. Ti is calculated as follows 7  where nHONO–i and nLUNO+i represent the occupancies at HONO
– i and LUNO + i. For pure
diradical, yi = 1, i.e., Ti = 0 which implies that nHONO–i = nLUNO+i. The value of yi of a molecule is expected to be intermediate
between 0 and 1 for
SF to occur.
