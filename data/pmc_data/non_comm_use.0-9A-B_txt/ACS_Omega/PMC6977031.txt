In this work, size-tunable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
microparticles
are fabricated from a high-viscosity oil phase using a facile coflowing
capillary microfluidic device and optimized aqueous phase composition.
The dispersity of the microparticle size is tuned by engineering of
the viscosity of the continuous phase and flow rate ratio that leads
us to achieve monodisperse microparticles. Regarding the high potential
of the PDMS microparticles for optical applications, efficient environmentally
durable perovskite-based UV sensors are fabricated employing the designed
size-tunable microparticles. Surprisingly, the UV sensors comprising
CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite quantum dots
as UV-sensitive nanocrystals embedded in transparent PDMS microparticles
are water resistant because of the high hydrophobicity of PDMS. Remarkably,
the UV sensors show a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 75%
that can be employed effortlessly as reusable leak detectors in different
fluidic working systems.

Introduction
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is the most
widely used silicone polymer
that can form a 3D network via crosslinking reactions between reactive
groups. Desirable properties of PDMS comprising biocompatibility,
high elasticity, durability, gas permeability, transparency, non-degradability,
and high hydrophobicity introduce this polymer as a high-potential
material to be used in various fields including medical products,1,2 optical devices,3 membranes,4,5 water treatment,6 coatings,7,8 and microfluidic chips.9 PDMS precursors
are produced in a wide range of viscosity with the aim of employing
in the aforementioned fields in different formats. Remarkably, a microparticle
is a novel architecture that provides a lot of high-potential applications
for PDMS like sensors,10 actuators,11 the toughening agent for polymer resins,12 encapsulating agent for phase change materials,13 controlled release carriers,14 and mimicking RBCs in blood.15 In spite of the aforementioned remarkable properties, formation
of PDMS emulsion in aqueous liquids with a controlled structure is
a pending challenge due to its low surface energy and high viscosity,
especially at high temperatures required for thermal curing of the
polymer. Accordingly, microfluidics as a new attractive technology
has been employed to fabricate the precisely controlled emulsions,
resulting in highly monodisperse emulsions with tailored structural
and morphological properties. Thus far, some researches on the preparation
of PDMS microparticles by microfluidic devices are reported,10,13−17 and in all of these researches, the low-viscosity PDMS has been
utilized. The literature survey shows that there is a demand for new
approaches to overcome the limitations of high-viscosity PDMS applicability
and also device complexity for curable PDMS fluids.18,19

In this regard, for a defined dispersed phase, the continuous
phase
properties and the microfluidic device architecture are the key parameters
to provide the formation of morphologically controlled PDMS microparticles
from a high-viscosity precursor. In fact, the flow regimes can be
easily adjusted by variation of continuous phase properties including
surface tension and viscosity. Recently, the coflowing technique has
been employed as an effective technique for generating desired microparticles.20−22 Polymeric chips generally are PDMS-based devices and conventionally
employed for droplet formation devices; however, they face some challenges
such as swelling of PDMS where nonpolar solvents are used.23 Remarkably, the glass capillary coflow devices
offer high-potential benefits in terms of the low cost of fabrication,
stability against organic solvents, and no leakage fluids compared
to the polymeric chip devices fabricated by molding or lithography
methods.10,24,25

As stated,
PDMS microparticles prepared by microfluidic devices
provide a wide range of applications, especially in optical devices
because of their high hydrophobicity, transparency, and durability.
Interestingly, microparticles can be combined with an active optical
material to employ as sensors for different applications. Among all
optical sensors, UV sensors are widely utilized in many applications
including leakage detection in closed and open working systems.26 In this regard, an efficient optically active
material with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) should
be selected to combine with the microparticles. However, process compatibility
of the PDMS microparticles and the optically active material should
be considered as a key factor. Recently, organic–inorganic
hybrid halide perovskites (PSKs) (ABX3,where A = CH3NH3, Cs; B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, or I) have been
widely attended as promising materials to employ as the active layers
in optoelectronic devices, owing to their excellent advantages such
as low cost, tunable band gap, ambipolar property, long charge carrier
diffusion lengths, and solution processability.27 Although hybrid PSKs were first used as a sensitizer in
dye-sensitized solar cells, and subsequently, highly efficient PSK
solar cells were fabricated with power conversion efficiency up to
23%,28 they also showed excellent light-emitting
properties such as low nonradiative recombination rates, high photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY), and emitting spectrally narrow light (full width
at half maximum (FWHM) ≈ 20 nm) with high color purity. It
is worth noting that the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of PSK
bulk films is limited by the low exciton binding energy (Eb) of the PSK bulk grains (e.g., 76 meV for CH3NH3PbBr3) and low PLQY.29 PSK quantum dots (QDs) are introduced as promising candidates
to overcome the PSK bulk films limitations to be employed for PL applications.
In this regard, halide PSK QDs with a size less than the exciton Bohr
diameter (<10 nm) exhibited a high Eb and low exciton diffusion length that can help achieve high PLQYs.
Synthesis of colloidal CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs with enhanced PL properties (PLQY of 17% for colloidal nanocrystals)
was firstly reported by Schmidt et al.30 Subsequently, different types of PSK QDs were synthesized by colloidal
and noncolloidal strategies, yielding PLQYs up to 95%.31−34 In contrast to the high PLQY and desired optical properties, both
bulk and nanocrystal grains of PSKs are strongly sensitive to moisture,
heat, and some organic solvents. Thus, these materials need to be
stabilized before using for different applications. Encapsulation
is one of the main strategies employed for PSK protection against
aforementioned stresses. Among all polymers, PDMS is a proper choice
for encapsulation of optical PSK devices because of its mentioned
properties, especially superior hydrophobicity, durability, and transparency.

In the present work, size-tunable PDMS microparticles are fabricated
from a high-viscosity precursor and used in a novel application field
as a protective matrix for environmentally destructive PSK to prepare
UV sensors. Remarkably, the microparticles are fabricated using a
designed facile reusable capillary glass microfluidic device. To fabricate
PSK-based UV sensors, CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dot-embedded PDMS microparticles are fabricated and characterized.
In these microparticles, PSK QDs with a PLQY as high as 95% are used
as photodetectors that can be effortlessly utilized for leakage detection
in operating fluid systems.

Results and Discussion
Microparticles Size Dispersity
A photo of the manufactured
capillary glass microfluidic device and also the scheme of the microchannel
are shown in Figure 1A,B, respectively. Figure 1C shows the formation of a PDMS droplet in the microfluidic
device that gives an oil-in-water emulsion. The morphology of the
prepared PDMS microparticles is shown in Figure 1D,E. As observed, the formed PDMS microparticles
are quite spherical, smooth, and also monodisperse that refers to
a dripping flow regime. It is worth noting that the designed device
with the easy-clean process because of the glass channels and also
appropriate sealing by epoxy glue is reusable and can be utilized
several times without any change in its performance attained by its
resistance to organic solvents. Also, when the device is clogged,
it would be cleaned easily by suction of the solvent in the opposite
direction of the flow that is possible because of the design of the
device. In this regard, the high endurance of the device against the
pressure of the liquids and also observation of no leakage through
the using of the device for many times are confirmed experimentally.
In contrast to the literature18,19 that necessitated a
relatively low viscosity for the fluids processed in the typical microfluidic
methods to achieve uniform droplets, this simple device generates
the size-controlled curable PDMS microdroplets from the high-viscosity
precursors.

capillary glass microfluidic device as the experimental setup, (C)

microchannel, (D) SEM, and (E) optical microscopy picture of the formed
monodisperse microparticles of PDMS from a dripping regime.

To define the dependency of the microparticles
shape, size, and
dispersity on the flow regime, process parameters comprising the viscosity
of the continuous phase and the ratio of the flow rates are considered.
Monodisperse microparticles can be obtained when the PDMS drops begin
to drip from the tapered capillary tip and move along with aqueous
fluid after adjusting the flow rates.35−37 This is known as the
dripping regime, one of the two possible regimes in coflowing geometry
leading to monodisperse drops. In this regime, interfacial force is
dominant over inertial force and is confronted with the pulling out
of the drop from the nozzle. Figure 1D,E shows particles formed in the CPV5 condition via
the dripping regime. The second regime, known as jetting, is characterized
by the formation of the long liquid jet, which breaks into droplets
further downstream that occurs as a result of the sufficient increment
of the flow rate of either the inner or the outer fluids or the viscosity
of the outer fluid.38 There are two distinct
jetting regimes: the narrowing and widening regimes that reflect the
shape of the jet flow in each regime. The narrowing jetting regime
appears when the viscous shear forces from the outer liquid overcome
the surface tension forces.39 On the other
hand, the widening jetting occurs as a result of exceeding the inertial
force of the inner phase over the interfacial force. When the regime
shifts from dripping to jetting, the neck starts to form then extends
from the exit of the inner channel to the primary droplet that finally
detaches. This neck causes the formation of the small satellite droplets
against primary droplets. This explained step is named the transition
regime, although in many reports, it was considered as a part of the
dripping regime and named as polydisperse dripping.35,39 Because the length of the neck significantly grows up in the jetting
regime, the narrowing regime comprises only a thread.

The physics
of the explained behaviors can be captured by two dimensionless
numbers: the capillary number of the continuous phase (Cac) that describes the relative importance of the viscose forces to
interfacial force and the Weber number of the dispersed phase (Wed) as the ratio of the inertial forces to interfacial
force, 1   2  where μc and
νc are the continuous phase viscosity and velocity,
respectively. Further, ρd, Qd, Di, and γ are the dispersed
phase density, flow rate, inner diameter of inner capillary tip, and
the interfacial tension between the two liquids, respectively. The
dynamics of the formation of the disperse droplets depends on many
parameters, including continuous and disperse phase flow rates, viscosities,
interfacial tensions, and diameter of the channels. Here, the size
and size distribution of microdroplets and microparticles are exemplified
by varying the continuous phase viscosity and also the flow rate ratio
in a certain device.

Effect of Continuous Phase Viscosity
To study the size
distribution of the particles, optical microscopy and SEM images are
analyzed using an image analyzer software. Figure 2 exhibits the dependency of the particle
size distribution on the continuous phase viscosity tuned by HEC concentration,
leading to having three different drop formation modes. It can be
seen that by changing the aqueous phase viscosity about 10-fold at
fixed flow rates of Qc = 20 mL/h and Qd = 0.037 mL/h, PDMS microparticles with diameters
from 500 to 20 μm can be formed. However, as it is obvious from Figure 2A, the size of the
particles is in the ranges of 450–500 and 330–390 μm
for CPV1 and CPV2 samples, respectively. The reason for such relatively
broad range of particle size in the dripping regime can be related
to the varying viscosity of the curable PDMS liquid. Rheometry result
shows the increase of the PDMS mixture viscosity by 19.3% in half
an hour after being mixed at the test running temperature (Figure S1). Here, for all experiments, the We number is very low (We < 0.0025).
For the low viscosities of the continuous phase at constant velocities
(Ca < 0.3),35,37 the growth of the oil droplet
occurs at the tip of the capillary followed by the formation and thinning
of a neck as a result of the increasing drag force against the interfacial
tension. Subsequently, it leads to the detaching of the droplet from
the oil phase by shrinking the neck. Increasing the continuous phase
viscosity, rises the drag force exerted on the droplet leading to
the formation of a smaller droplet as a result of the quickening of
force balance. Subsequently, as the Ca value increases up to 0.3,
the dripping regime shifts to the jetting one. As a result, a PDMS
jet is generated from the tip of the tapered capillary trough a long
distance that finally breaks up into several droplets due to the Rayleigh–Plateau
instability. Thus, broader size distribution and smaller droplets
can be achieved in the jetting regime (Figure 2B). In the jetting regime, a widening jetting
followed by narrowing jetting occurs, which are clearly evident in Figure 2C. It is clear that
the microparticles obtained from the widening jetting (CPV5) are more
narrowly dispersed and larger in size in comparison to the narrowing
jetting (CPV8) with tiny satellite particles (Figure 2C). In the narrowing jetting regime, increasing
the viscosity of the continuous phase reduces the number and size
of the satellite particles as the size of the primary particles decreases
(CPV6 in Figure 2C).
Consequently, the gap between two maximum points exhibited in Figure 2C reduces gradually,
and finally, the primary peak become significantly dominant.

0.037 mL/h), (B) the transition flow regime (Qc = 20 mL/h, Qd = 0.037 mL/h),
(C) jetting flow regimes via continuous phase viscosity (Qc = 20 mL/h, Qd = 0.037 mL/h).

Effect of Continuous Phase Flow Rate
Samples from different
flow rates are listed in Table 1.

Rates of the Continuous Phase with a Constant Disperse Phase Rate
of 0.037 mL/h
sample	CPR1	CPR2	CPR3	CPR4	CPR5	CPR6	CPR7	CPR8	
rate (mL/h)	8	16	24	36	40	48	56	68	
Figure 3 shows the
influence of the aqueous phase flow rate on the particle size, size
distribution, and flow regime. The mean diameter of the particles
decreases from 435.7 to 56.0 μm for the continuous phase as
the flow rate increases from 8 to 68 mL/h. The PDMS (dispersed) phase
flow rate and continuous phase viscosity are kept constant at Qd = 0.037 mL/h and η = 67.15 mPa s, respectively.
In the low continuous phase flow rates, the capillary number value
is lower than 0.3, and the drag force is insufficient to stretch the
dispersed phase into a long jet. So, it leads us to achieve a dripping
flow regime (Figure 3A). The regime of the flow goes through a transition from dripping
to the jetting regime as the flow rate of the continuous phase increases
(Figure 3B). As the
flow rate becomes higher than 30 mL/h, Ca exceeds 0.3, and the flow
regime completely shifts to the jetting regime (Figure 3C). Enhancing the rate of the continuous
phase increases the length of the disperse phase thread, decreases
the size of the primary droplet, and increases the number and size
of the satellite droplets. As the flow rate of the continuous phase
increases up to much higher extents, two peaks of the particle size
belonging to primary and satellite droplets become close together
and eventually turn into a single peak that shifts to the left side
of the curve, which resemble the result of increasing the continuous
phase viscosity (Figure 3C).

via the continuous phase flow rate (viscosity = 67.15 mPa.s, Qd = 0.037 mL/h).

UV Sensor Based on Perovskite QD/PDMS Microparticles
Figure 4 represents
the characteristics of the synthesized PSK QDs used as detectors in
the PDMS microparticle-based UV sensor. SEM, AFM, and TEM images (Figure 4A,B, and Figure S2) show that MAPbBr3 nanocrystals
have a diameter less than 10 nm providing the strong charge carrier
confinement and high PL intensity. The XRD diffraction peak of MAPbBr3 QDs exhibited in Figure 4C confirms the formation of the cubic PSK structure.
The major diffraction peaks at 15, 30.2, and 34.03° corresponding
to 100, 200, and 210 planes are assigned to cubic PSK.40

Figure 4 (A) SEM, (B) AFM, and (C) XRD diffraction peaks of the
synthesized
PSK QDs.

The absorbance and PL spectra of the PSK QDs reveal
the strong
absorption of these nanocrystals in the UV range and subsequently
an efficient green light emission at λ = 532 nm (Figure 5A). Interestingly, PSK QDs
result in a PLQY higher than 90%, introducing them as efficient UV
sensors through a wide range of UV wavelengths (Figure 5C, Figure S3).
Thus, the light-emitting ability of the fabricated photodetectors
will not be suppressed, as the wavelength of the incident light deviates
from the excitation peak.

nm) of (A) PSK QDs
and (B) PSKQDs/ PDMS and (C) PL spectrum of PSK QDs as a function
of excitation wavelength.

To achieve UV sensors, tunable PSK QD-embedded
microparticles are
formed by the microfluidic device as well. As explained above, PDMS/PSK
QDs utilized as the oil phase through the microfluidic process to
form durable QD-embedded microparticles act as UV sensors. Schematic
of the optical sensors applicable in different working systems and
its sensing mechanism is presented in Figure 6A. As observed, PSK QDs are excited by absorption
of the incident UV light and subsequently emit green light through
radiative recombination of electrons and holes. Interestingly, the
wavelength of the emitted light from the microparticle/PSK QD detectors
is close to that wavelength range in which the human eye is most sensitive
(Figure 5B).

PLQY measurement and inset exhibits the photo of the emission of UV
sensors under λ = 400 nm, (C) PLQY of PDMS/ PSK QD UV sensors
measured under UV light with λ = 400 nm and various light intensities,
and (D) PLQYs of PSK QD/PDMS UV sensors through immersion in water.

The intensity of emission can be easily tuned by
PSK QD percentage
in microparticles and the intensity of the incident UV light. The
light intensity-dependent PLQY of the PDMS/PSK QD optical device under
a 400 nm continuous excitation is exhibited in Figure 6B,C. Remarkably, the PDMS/PSK QD UV sensor
shows a high PLQY up to 75% even at an excitation intensity as low
as about 0.6 mW cm–2. It indicates that the fabricated
UV sensors can be employed under low-intensity UV light without losing
the ability of the detection. Fortunately, high transparency of PDMS
causes no significant loss in emitted light from PSK QDs.

It
should be noted that water and heat sensitivities of halide
PSK are the main challenges regarding its application. Surprisingly,
in the formed microparticle sensors, PSK nanocrystals are embedded
in PDMS as a hydrophobic polymer, which are efficiently protected
against moisture attack. As shown in Figure 6D, no significant change is observed in the
PLQY of PDMS/PSK UV sensors through immersion in water for 14 days.
Moreover, the high resistivity of the formed microparticles sensors
against different solvents provides an excellent leak detection technique
to find the leakage sites of an operating fluid throughout different
open and closed working systems without causing any contamination.
In conventional leak detecting techniques, the operating fluids such
as heat transfer fluids, oils, and hydraulic fluids are treated with
semiconductor fluorescent dyes that contaminate the working systems,
and further washing steps are needed after determining the leakage
sites. Additionally, the conventional leak detectors such as organic
dyes and pigments are disposable,26 while
PSK microparticles UV sensors are reusable. The PDMS coating makes
detectors compatible with different environments. Figure S4 shows an experimental sample of a leakage detection
of a pipe by preparing a UV sensor exposed to UV under λ = 400
nm.

Conclusions
In summary, size tunable PDMS microparticles
were fabricated from
a high-viscosity oil phase using a facile coflowing capillary microfluidic
device. The quite spherical and uniform solid PDMS microparticles
were achieved from the formed size-tunable PDMS microdroplets in the
oil-in-water emulsion. The dependency of microparticles dispersity
on viscosity of the continuous phase and flow rate was investigated.
UV sensors based on CH3NH3PbBr3 PSK
QDs were fabricated by employing the formed size-tunable PDMS microparticles.
In UV sensors, PSK QDs worked as photodetectors and transparent PDMS
acted as a matrix and transporter that caused no significant loss
in the emitted light from PSK QDs. Fortunately, the formed microparticle/PSK
QD UV sensors were water and solvent resistant that resulted in PLQY
as high as 75% even under low intensity of the incident UV light that
can be employed effortlessly as leak detectors in operating fluid
systems. In contrast to the conventional leakage detectors for operating
fluids, the fabricated leakage detectors were reusable and caused
no contamination in the lines.

Experimental Section
Materials
Vinyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane),
Sylgard 184, composed of two fluids, part A (base) and part B (curing
agent), manufactured by Dow Corning, is used as the oil phase to prepare
PDMS microparticles. The anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), is purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Commercial grade poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) and hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC) are employed as
aqueous phase stabilizers. Ethanol (99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich)
is added to the bath to stabilize the PDMS droplets. PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and CH3NH3Br are used as the
precursors of PSK materials that are dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) purchased from
Merck.

Fabrication of the Microfluidic Device
A coflow microfluidic
device with two inlets is fabricated by assembling two cylindrical
glass capillaries having an inner diameter of 1.15 mm and outer diameter
of 1.55 mm. To gain the desired tip diameter of the capillary, it
is stretched on the flame and then polished using an abrasive paper.
Dispersed and continuous phases flow in tapered and cylindrical capillaries
without pretreatment, respectively. Feeding tubes (i.d. = 1.15 and
o.d. = 2.00 mm) are used to connect and axially align two capillaries
and also employed to introduce two fluids to the capillaries. The
components of the device are fixed and sealed by a curable epoxy glue.41

Preparation of Monodisperse Emulsions and Solid Microparticles
Oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions are prepared using the fabricated
microfluidic device containing two inlets for dispersed and continuous
phases. The dispersed oil phase is Sylgard 184 PDMS with a 10:1 ratio
of part A to part B. The continuous phase is a mixture of water, PVA,
SDS, and HEC with different compositions as indicated in Table 2. Both fluids are
injected using syringes into feeding tubes and then into the microfluidic
device. Syringe pumps are employed to accurately control fluid flow
rates. The continuous phase including PDMS droplets is collected downstream
in a bath solution having the composition that is the same as that
for continuous phase with 10 wt % of ethanol. In the absence of ethanol,
droplets move to the surface of the solution and stick together during
the curing process in the oven. After the accumulation of a desired
amount of droplets in the bath, it is put in an oven to cure at 65
°C for 5 h.

Fabrication of UV Sensors Based on PSK QD and PDMS Microparticles
First, CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 are
separately dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 1 M concentration. Besides, a solution
containing a polymer with 0.2 mg/mL concentration in DMF is separately
prepared. To in situ-form PSK QD films, 60 μL of the mixture
of precursor solutions is poured on cleaned and dried glass substrates
and subsequently spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s. After deposition,
the substrates are quickly transferred to the hot plate and annealed
for 5 min at 100 °C to remove the residual solvents. To form
microparticles containing PSK QDs as detectors, PDMS is mixed with
the deposited QD nanocrystals, and the mixture is employed as the
precursor in microfluidics process.

Characterization
To measure the viscosity of the precursors,
a rheometer (Anton Paar-MCR 301) equipped with concentric cylinders
is used. Phenom scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to investigate
the morphology and determine the size of the solid microparticles.
Further, optical microscopy is used to investigate the large-sized
particles. Subsequently, the SEM and optical microscopy images are
analyzed by Digimizer software to obtain the size distribution of
the microparticles. Besides, the optical microscopy together with
high-speed camera interfaced to a PC computer is employed to trace
the drop formation through the microfluidic device. The interfacial
tension between two liquids is measured by the drop weight method.42,43

To determine the exact size of the PSK QDs, Philips CM30 transmission
electron microscopy is employed. The absorption and PL spectra of
the PSK QDs and PSK QD/PDMS microparticles are recorded by an Avantes
UV–visible spectrophotometer (AvaSpec 2048 model) and a Perkin–Elmer
spectrofluorometer (Frontier model), respectively. In order to investigate
the crystalline nature of PSK materials, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra
are obtained on a Philips diffractometer (X’Pert MPD model)
equipped with a proportional Xe-filled detector, Cu tube (λ
= 1.54056 Å). The absolute PLQY of the thin PSK QDs and PSK QD/PDMS
nanocomposites are recorded using an Avantes spectrophotometer with
an integrated sphere excited at a wavelength of 400 nm.
