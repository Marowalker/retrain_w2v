The production of nanoparticles on
an industrial scale requires
an approach other than the widely used hot-injection method. In this
work, two heat-up methods are applied to nanoparticle synthesis. The
induction heating method produces CdSe quantum dots with ultrasmall
properties in seconds. Initial flow-through experiments demonstrate
that induction heating continuously produces quantum dots. These results
are compared with those from microwave synthesis, which produces quantum
dots on a longer timescale but provides fast, continuous heating.
Both methods can produce quantum dots within seconds because of rapid
heating. In addition, different precursors, single source and separate
source, give different results, ultimately providing a handle to control
quantum dot properties.

Introduction
Semiconducting nanoparticles
have a variety of unique properties
that are different from those of their bulk counterparts because of
quantum confinement and their large surface-to-volume ratios. These
properties inspire interest in applications such as solar cells,1−3 batteries, bioimaging,4,5 catalysis,6−9 and data storage.10 The strong dependence
of these properties on their diameter means that controlling the size
of these particles is crucial to tuning these characteristics.11 CdSe quantum dots (QDs) have been studied extensively
as a model system of such particles. The ability to manufacture QDs
on a large scale is of critical interest because low-cost fabrication
methods are a large advantage of these materials. It is important
to produce highly homogeneous, monodispersed QDs in a bench-top synthesis
route with potential for scale-up production and control over their
surface chemistry, crystalline structure, and shape.11

Heat-up methods for QD synthesis are well-established
but significantly
less popular than hot-injection methods.12 Most methods employ rapid-heating techniques to achieve narrow size
distributions by separation of particle nucleation and growth.13,14 Methods analogous to hot injection often suffer from unoptimized
conditions and reliance on established procedures. The most general
method is a simple combination of precursors used in hot injection
in a flask followed by heating up the flask using an external heat
source such as an oil bath or a heating mantle. The high temperatures
used for formation of high-quality QDs often take minutes to attain
(Figure 1a). An alternative
is microwave (MW)-assisted heating, in which MWs applied to the reaction
mixture can rapidly increase temperature (Figure 1b).15 Here, we
demonstrate the use of a new method, induction heating (IH), to synthesize
QDs in a batch and flow reactor. Although IH has been used for chemical
synthesis,16 it has not been used for QD
synthesis, to the best of our knowledge.

Figure 1 Pictures of the experimental
setups used in this work: (a) heating
mantle, (b) MW reactor and a camera image, and (c) IH and a thermal
camera image.

IH uses eddy currents
generated in a conductor by applying a rapidly
alternating magnetic field, usually produced by an electromagnet.
The heat generated in the material through Joule heating is proportional
to the resistance of the conductor. In addition, ferromagnetic materials
can produce heat more efficiently in the presence of alternating magnetic
fields because of the movement of magnetic domain walls. The increased
temperature of the conductor results in an increased resistance, which
increases the amount of heat generated, forming a positive feedback
loop where the heating rate increases with time. In comparison, the
heat generated by MW heating is result of a combination of dipolar
rotation and ionic conduction.17 Heat generated
by ionic conduction is linear with respect to time. Because of the
different characteristics and mechanisms of the two heating methods,
it increases the number of collisions, further increasing the heating
rate, but heating from dipolar rotation generally decreases at higher
temperatures. MW heating is valued for heat-up QD synthesis because
of rapid heating rates.18,19 It is reasonable to
expect IH to be an interesting method for QD syntheses for its extremely
high heating rate. Rapid heating is critical in the separation of
nucleation and growth rates of QDs in homogeneous colloidal solutions.14 This study demonstrates that the rapid heating
rates from IH can shorten the nucleation stages during QD growth and
provide greater control of particle size and size distribution. Comparison
of the results with those from MW heating shows that the MW method
also has its unique advantages such as rapid, uniform, controlled
heating.

Results and Discussion
In nanoparticle synthesis, the
rate of heating affects the nucleation
and growth rates with important consequences for the final size and
size distribution of the particles. With the experimental setup as
shown in top of Figure 1, IH routinely achieved a heating rate of 110 °C/s,20 whereas a conventional heating mantle heats
at 1 °C/s. Dodecylamine (DDA) is chosen as a solvent for its
ability to stabilize the QD product at room temperature in a solid-phase
matrix. To prevent unintended decomposition, the precursor complex
Li4 [Cd10Se4(SPh)16] is
slowly dissolved in DDA in a water bath while being well-stirred so
that no part of the reaction mixture is exposed to temperatures higher
than 70 °C. To prevent oxidization during synthesis and cooling,
the solution mixture is purged under argon after being loaded into
the reaction vessel through two needles injected on the top for 5
min. The heating rate is controlled by the induction current. The
temperature rise can be measured with a fiber optic temperature probe,
and it also can be estimated from the boiling of degassed solvents.
Estimation from the boiling point of the solvents puts the heating
rate at 200–300 °C/s, depending on the current used. Such
rapid heating allowed us to successfully synthesize sub-2 nm ultrasmall
(US) CdSe QDs with only 2 s of heating. As shown in Figure 2, the absorption spectrum indicates
that the particles have a narrow size distribution with an average
diameter of 1.8 nm (calculated).21 Through
numerous experiments, a 2 s minimum heating time is needed to produce
particles with the present experimental apparatus. This is explained
by the nonlinear relationship between heating rate and time caused
by the increase of resistance in the steel balls as temperature rises.
Therefore, it becomes increasingly less effective to increase heating
rate by applying higher currents. In addition, the heat transfer rate
between steel balls, solvent, and precursor molecules stays constant
regardless of the current applied. At a certain point, it is not surprising
that the heat transfer rate also becomes a bottleneck for achieving
even faster synthesis. Even faster heating could be achieved with
optimization of heat transfer so that particles can be produced with
<2 s of heating, an unprecedented and greatly attractive prospect.
Although heating is rapid, cooling is slow and particles continue
to grow during the cooling process. Accelerated cooling can be implemented
in our experimental setup and in a later section it will be shown
that quenching has interesting effects on the different properties
and characteristics of the particles produced. For potential scale-up,
a flow-through setup can take advantage of this cooling as heated
material can move through the heating chamber and continue to cool
while new cold material moves in.

Figure 2 UV–vis absorption and PL spectra
of CdSe QDs produced with
IH. The absorption feature corresponds to a diameter of 1.8 nm.

As a proof of concept, here, continuous
synthesis of QDs is demonstrated
with a modified flow-through setup. Figure 3 shows the setup and the absorption and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of two samples collected at different heating temperatures.
The “high-heat” sample was collected at ∼250
°C, and the “low-heat” sample was collected at
∼150 °C. As expected, the low-heat sample showed overall
smaller particle sizes, and the high-heat sample showed a mixture
of small and larger sizes based on the absorption spectrum of the
particles. In the present experiment, continuously running the synthesis
at a roughly 1 mL/s pumping rate translates to just over 1 kg of nanoparticles
produced per hour with a very crude estimation. In fact, a faster
pumping rate would be more ideal as even the lowest heating current
(2 A) is able to boil the solvent. Equilibrium of the heating temperature
could be achieved by fine-tuning the pumping rate and heating current
but requires more intricate engineering. Nevertheless, this demonstration
of IH flow-through synthesis is compelling for scaling-up material
production.

of samples prepared at low (∼150 °C) and high (∼250
°C) temperatures using the continuous flow setup.

To show the novel properties and advantages of
rapid IH synthesis,
a set of data using CdSe has been obtained comparing IH, MW heating,
and regular heat-up synthesis with a heating mantle, which typically
runs at a heating rate of 1 °C/min (Figure 1). MW synthesis often obtains rapid heating
rates in comparison to traditional heat-up methods15 but is also slower than IH (Figure 1). Nevertheless, MW heating provides a different
heating mechanism for QD synthesis and therefore a different engineering
control in industrial settings, so it will be compared with IH later.
First, IH was compared with traditional heat-up synthesis using a
heating mantle (normal heating). As shown in Figure 4, 2 s of IH produced an absorption peak centered
at approximately 437 nm. After 2 h of normal heating, the absorption
feature red-shifts. IH for 2 s followed by 2 h of normal heating resulted
in a further red shift in the absorption peak. On the basis of the
optical absorption of the particles, the growth kinetics have been
altered significantly. The TEM images of the particles indicate very
different shapes present in the growth solution. It can be clearly
seen that the short IH induces the formation CdSe nanorods. We speculate
that either the initial IH may produce more monodisperse US CdSe QDs
followed by subsequent assembly to nanorods or the IH directly produces
preferential growth in one direction of the CdSe QDs, resulting in
the observed rod shape.

Figure 4 (a) Comparison of absorption spectra of CdSe
QDs synthesized with
2 s of IH (2 s MH), 2 s of IH followed by 2 h of normal heating (2
s MH + 2 h NH), and 2 h of normal heating alone (2 h NH). TEM images

For comparison of IH to MW heating, the reaction conditions
were
made as similar as possible. The same precursor mixture was used,
but only 2 mL per reaction to accommodate the 10 mL Pyrex vessel.
In previous studies of MW-assisted QD synthesis, rapid heating was
achieved by combining solvents that are not polar or ionic with good
MW-absorbing precursors in a Pyrex vessel, so the MW radiation can
interact directly with the molecules in the solution.22 Reactions initially used a Pyrex vessel, but the reaction
temperature failed to reach the set point of 200 °C as indicated
by the temperature–time plot in the inset of Figure 5. This is likely because the
Li4Cd10Se4(SPh)16 cluster
and DDA ligand are poor MW-absorbing materials.23 However, using a SiC vessel, which absorbs most of the
MW radiation, leads to convective heating that is similar to traditional
heat-up methods, and the reaction reaches 200 °C (Figure 5, inset).24 The UV–vis absorption and PL spectra of the CdSe
QDs synthesized using the single-source precursor (SSP) in Pyrex and
SiC vessels are shown in Figure 5. The red shift in both the absorption and emission
peaks of the QDs prepared in the SiC vessel indicates a size increase
of the CdSe QDs.

Figure 5 Absorption and PL spectra of US CdSe QDs synthesized using
the
SSP Li4[Cd10Se4(SPh)16] in the MW reactor. The CdSe synthesis was carried out in both glass
(black) and silicon carbide (SiC, red) vessels at a set temperature
of 200 °C. The inset shows the corresponding temperature vs time
plots and that the reaction failed to reach 200 °C in the glass
vessel.

Although temperatures of 200 °C
can be reached using the SiC
vessel, to obtain the fastest heating rate using MW heating, a better
MW absorbing material was used. Tri-n-octylphosphine
(TOP) chalcogenides are established MW absorbers and can lead to fast
heating rates.25 The reaction mixture contained
Cd(OA)2, TOPSe, and oleylamine (OLA). This mixture was
heated to 150 °C at 850 W set power (SP) with hold times of 0,
15, and 30 s. The heating profile indicates that the heating rate
is similar in all reactions, as seen in Figure 6 (inset) and the power versus time plots
(Figure S3). As the hold time increases,
the UV–vis absorption spectra show a slight red shift in the
peak centered at 415 nm and a new peak appearing around 450 nm (Figure 6). The new peak at
around 450 nm is a result of the size increase of the CdSe QDs from
magic-size (MS) clusters to US QDs (diameters below 2 nm).26 Dagtepe and Chikan have shown that having tellurium-rich
(selenium in this study) conditions leads to the formation of MS QDs.27 The systematic absorption peak shift shows that
the CdSe size increases from MS to US following homogenous growth.26Figure 7 shows the PL and PL excitation (PLE) spectra for the US QDs.
One of the unique properties of US QDs is the presence of two emission
peaks: a higher energy band-edge peak and lower energy trap emission.26 The sharp band-edge peak red-shifts from 460
nm (0 s) to 472 nm (30 s) as the hold time increases, but the emission
profiles of small-sized QDs are dominated by trap emission because
of their large surface-to-volume ratios.28 Therefore, the second peak observed in the PL spectra is ascribed
to the QDs instead of impurities in solution. To further investigate
this, PLE spectra were recorded at different emission wavelengths. Figure 7 shows the excitation
spectra with 575 nm detection. The similar features in the excitation
spectra provide evidence that the second peak is trap emission from
the QDs.

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption spectra of US CdSe QDs synthesized using
Cd(OA)2 and TOPSe in the MW reactor at 150 °C and
850 W SP with hold times of 0 (black), 15 (red), and 30 (blue) seconds.
The inset shows the corresponding temperature vs time plots.

Figure 7 PL and PLE spectra of US CdSe QDs synthesized
using Cd(OA)2 and TOPSe in the MW reactor at 150 °C
and 850 W SP with
hold times of (A) 0, (B) 15, and (C) 30 s. The PL spectra were obtained
using 405 nm excitation, and the PLE spectra were obtained for the
emission at 575 nm.

Because rapid MW-assisted
heating was achieved with different precursors,
we next compare CdSe QDs synthesized from the SSP and cadmium oleate
(CdOA)–TOPSe mixture using IH. Figure 8 shows the absorption and PL spectra of the
samples, and the shorter wavelength of the absorption peak corresponds
to smaller particles produced with the mixed precursor compared to
those formed from the SSP. A second peak corresponding to larger particles
was also observed. The two distinct peaks are the result of the so-called
sequential growth process, where distinct sizes of particles coexist
at early stages of growth and then coalesce to form larger particles
later.29 Combined with the fact that the
shorter peak wavelength corresponds to smaller particles produced
than those from SSP, it is clear that the mixed precursor had a slower
reaction rate than the SSP. Different reaction potentials of the precursor
molecule can cause a difference in the nucleation rate, as it affects
the rate at which monomers are provided. The mixed precursor provides
monomers through combination of two components, whereas the SSP does
so through self-decomposition of the precursor molecule, a process
whose mechanism is not yet fully understood. Although it is difficult
to determine the energies involved in either two reactions, we do
qualitatively show such an effect as an example of potential optimizations
available for industrial applications.

Figure 8 Comparison of absorption
and PL spectra obtained from (a) the SSP
Li4[Cd10Se4(SPh)16] and
(b) the mixed Cd(OA)2–TOPSe precursor prepared with
IH.

Comparative syntheses of CdSe
QDs in OLA and DDA were also performed.
Previous studies suggest a correlation between the viscosity of solvent
and the rate of nucleation, as it is related to the rate of diffusion
of monomers.30 Therefore, solvents with
lower viscosity would result in higher nucleation rates and narrower
size distributions. PL data (Figure S2)
show no significant difference between samples prepared in solvents
with different viscosities. Such a theory is made under the assumption
of normal heating and stirring conditions, but with rapid IH, the
effects of solvent viscosity and stirring become negligible. The nucleation
process, which normally lasts several tens of minutes, is done in
2 s, and along with the fast self-stirring of solvent caused by thermal
diffusion and degasification, differences caused by viscosity and
stirring become less relevant. The slightly larger size of the particles
prepared in DDA is explained by the higher solvent heat capacity,
which kept the reaction mixture at a higher temperature, allowing
the particles to grow for several minutes longer. Additionally, the
lower trap-state emission intensity agrees with the slower cooling
rate, as explained in the quenching section. Different ligand–particle
structures with unknown electronic properties formed by the two solvents
could also contribute to different levels of trap-state emission.
This result revealed an unusual effect of extremely high heating rate
not predicted under current theories. Future work will use appropriate
modification to properly model the kinetics of nucleation and growth
under such conditions.

Although fast heating rates can be achieved
using MW-assisted synthesis,
there are some limitations. Comparison of the SSP and mixed precursors
shows that in the absence of a good MW absorber, rapid heating does
not occur and the reaction temperature may not even be accessible.
Another heating rate issue is illustrated in Figure S3. The power the instrument applies toward heating the reactions
is not the reaction SP. This prevents arcing and overheating, which
can lead to reaction vessel explosion because of pressure build-up.
In Figure S3, although the reaction SP
was 850 W, the power maximum was only around 450 W. As this is an
instrument-specific issue, modification of the MW reactor to apply
the SP could provide faster heating rates. Additional reaction modification
such as the use of unreactive, excellent MW-absorbing materials (such
as ionic liquids) can help achieve faster heating as well.31 These are a few of the multiple conditions,
not optimized here, available for reaching the fastest MW heating
rates.

The preliminary IH syntheses explored the various effects
of high
heating rate from a thermodynamics point of view and are not optimized.
Optimizations for the smallest particle size, shortest reaction time,
control of PL, or other light-emitting functions are all desirable.
All samples produced in these experiments exhibit both trap state
and band edge state emissions, which is expected for small-sized particles
with a high surface-to-volume ratio. A possible scenario is that the
CdSe has emissive deep trap sites (Se vacancies) with the interaction
of amine used as a solvent.32 Giansante
and Infante have shown that these surface traps could be potentially
healed once the origin of the traps is identified unambiguously.33 Our observation indicates that the emission
quantum yield of the IH synthesis-produced QDs is less than 10%. The
role of IH synthesis in the formation of defects (surface or otherwise)
will be further investigated in a future publication.

Conclusions
This study introduces a new IH method for CdSe synthesis and demonstrates
the effects of extreme high heating rate on the growth kinetics of
CdSe QDs. It is shown here that IH provides an effective means of
reducing the nucleation stage window, resulting in greater control
of particle size and size distribution. The results were compared
with those of MW heating, which is an attractive rapid heating method
in QD synthesis for its fine control of heating rate and rather uniform
heating, so small changes in reaction conditions can be used to fine-tune
QD properties reproducibly. Using MW-absorbing precursors provides
faster heating and with these, both methods form US CdSe QDs in seconds
without optimization. Preliminary demonstration of flow-through synthesis
shows the potential of IH for rapid, large-scale production of QDs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The following chemicals are used as received:
cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate
(Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 99+%) from Acros
Organics; thiophenol (PhSH, 97%), triethylamine (TEA, ≥99%),
selenium powder (Se, ≥99.5%), OLA (≥98%), DDA (98%,
degassed prior to use), indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 99.99%
trace metals basis), palmitic acid (≥99%), decane (≥99%),
and 1-octadecene (90%), from Sigma-Aldrich; tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) (97%), tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine (P(TMS)3, min. 98%, 10% in hexane), and indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 99.99%) from Strem; lithium nitrate (LiNO3, certified
grade) and oleic acid (OA, ≥97%), from Fisher Scientific; and
cadmium oxide (CdO, ≥99.0%) from Fluka. TOPSe (1 M) is prepared
by mixing 10 mL of TOP with 0.7896 g of Se powder. The mixture is
sonicated until all Se powder dissolves.

Li4[Cd10Se4(SPh)16] Precursor
The Li4[Cd10Se4(SPh)16] SSP is prepared
as reported by Cumberland et
al.34 Briefly, at room temperature, Li2[Cd4(SPh)10] is first prepared by adding
Cd(NO3)2·4H2O in methanol to
a solution of thiophenol and TEA in methanol, followed by addition
of lithium nitrate in methanol. The mixture is then stirred and cooled
to 0 °C to allow for crystallization. The washed and vacuum-dried
precipitate is then dissolved in acetonitrile, followed by addition
of selenium powder to produce Li4[Cd10Se4(SPh)16]. The precursor solution is prepared by
adding 0.3 g of Li4 [Cd10Se4(SPh)16] to 25 mL of DDA.

CdOA Precursor
CdOA is prepared
using CdO and OA at
a 1:5 mole ratio as described previously.35 The CdO powder and oleic acid are heated to 100 °C under vacuum
in a round-bottom flask for 2 h. Then, the solution is put under N2 and heated to 280 °C. The reaction is stopped after
the color changes from red-brown to light yellow, in about an hour.
On the basis of an adapted method,25 the
precursor solution is prepared by stirring a mixture of 0.675 g of
CdOA, 5.5 mL of 1 M TOPSe, 10 mL of TOP, and 2 mL of OLA at 65 °C
for 5 min in a 20 mL vial.

QD Preparation by IH
In a typical
IH synthesis, the
precursor and coordinating solvent (precursor solution) are mixed
at 45 °C in a glass vessel fitted with an optical thermometer
(Figure 1c). Steel
beads (26.13 g, Bearing-Quality E52100 Alloy Steel, Hardened Ball,
1/8″ Diameter) are added, and the mixture is purged with argon
for 5 min. Under argon flow, a current of 0–30.3 A is applied
for various durations. The steel beads appeared unreactive toward
the solution in the few seconds (s) of heating applied. The temperature
of the solution is lowered to 45 °C, and the sample is removed.
The power output of the setup is estimated at >600 W while using
highest
current (20 A) and >100 W while using lowest current (2.5 A) by
testing
with IH of water.

For flow-through continuous synthesis, the
abovementioned setup is modified as shown in Figure 3 (left). A thinner heating vessel with fewer
steel balls provides better control of the heating rate. The precursor
solution is preloaded into the pump tube and vessel, ensuring elimination
of air bubbles. A pump connected by tube feeds the precursor solution
into the heating vessel, so the flow rate and heating current can
be adjusted on the fly during synthesis. Samples produced under these
different parameters are collected.

QD Preparation by MW Heating
For MW syntheses, 2 mL
samples are prepared in tightly capped 10G Anton Paar MW vessels with
a stir bar. The synthesis is carried out in a MW reactor (Anton Paar
Monowave 300) at 850 W (Figure 1b). The temperature is measured with an external IR probe.
The MW method used the “heat-as-fast-as-possible” mode
and a reaction time (holding time) of 0–60 s, followed by cooling
to 55 °C using compressed air.

Characterization of QDs
UV–vis absorption spectra
are recorded with a Cary 500 or a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer. PL spectra are recorded using an Ocean Optics 2000+
spectrometer with 405 nm excitation and a PTI QuantaMaster 400 fluorometer,
which is also used for PLE spectra. For absorption and emission spectra
measurements, the samples are diluted in toluene to equal concentrations.
In situ monitoring of temperature of MW syntheses is accomplished
using an IR sensor. For transmission electron microscopy, the imaging
is done on an FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN microscope. Samples are
washed well in anhydrous methanol to remove excess ligands, dispersed
in toluene, and dropped onto a Cu grid. The resolution of the instrument
is 0.34 nm in the TEM mode.
