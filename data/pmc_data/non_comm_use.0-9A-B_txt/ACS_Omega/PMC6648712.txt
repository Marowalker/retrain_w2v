We report
modulating spontaneous four-wave mixing, fourth-order fluorescence,
and intensity noise correlation by polarization-dressing effect at
different temperatures in a Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. The delay time, Autler–Townes splitting, and shape
of correlation curve are changed observably with temperature and polarization
state of dressing field. These results demonstrate competition between
polarization-dressing and phonon effects. The impact of temperature
on nonlinear response is very important for the stability of quantum
optical devices.

I Introduction
Rare-earth ion-doped crystal has
been widely studied because of its advantages for coherent excitation
and because it is more appropriate for practical applications. Recent
researches on quantum coherence effect in rare-earth ion have been
reported, including electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT),1,2 stimulated Raman adiabatic passage,3 light
velocity reduction, coherent storage,4,5 and all-optical
routing.6 A Pr3+-doped Y2SiO5 crystal has long coherence time and narrow
spectral width as compared to traditional nonlinear crystals. So,
the atomic coherence can be induced easily in Pr3+:Y2SiO5. Rare-earth ion-doped crystal can find potential
applications in all-optical communication and optical information
processing on the photonic chip.

In practical applications,
coherent excitation processes are required to be controlled reliably.
Polarization-dressing effect offers a method to modulate the coherent
transition. Because different polarization states of pumping field
correspond to different transition ways in Zeeman levels, the EIT
processes can be controlled via polarization-dressing effect.7,8 We investigated polarization-dressed multi-order fluorescence (FL)
and spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in the Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal at low temperature.9,10 We
can control dressing signals by changing power, detuning, and polarization.11 The correlation and squeezing of FWM signal
can also be modulated via polarized dark states.12 Correlation and anticorrelation have been observed at different
polarization states.13 Such polarization-dressed
signals have potential applications such as all-optical switch and
route devices.14 Recently, hybrid correlation
between different types of states was identified as a useful resource
for optical quantum information processing and quantum computing.15,16 Hybrid correlation between SFWM and multi-order fluorescence has
also been obtained in the Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal.17

In our previous works,
all experiments were carried out at low temperature, so the phonon
effect has never been considered. In practical applications, temperature
plays an important role in device stability. Phonon effect can significantly
affect the nonlinear response of quantum optical devices with increasing
temperature. In this paper, we investigate the polarization-dressing
effect of fourth-order fluorescence at different temperatures. In
this case, phonon effect must be considered. Our results indicate
that the polarization-dressing effect competed with phonon effect.
We also modulate the hybrid correlation shape by cross-phase modulation.
Research about competition between polarization-dressing and phonon
effects is very important for obtaining a hybrid signal resource,
controlling quantum optical devices, and improving the stability of
all-optical devices.

II Theoretical Model
In a V-type three-level system with two
pumping fields E1 and E2 opening, the four-wave mixing and fluorescence signals are generated
simultaneously. The intensity of FWM is proportional to the third-order
nonlinear density matrix elements. The third-order nonlinear density
matrix elements for Stokes ES and anti-Stokes EAS signals can be written as 1   2  where d1 = Γ10 + iΔ1 and d2 =
Γ20 + iΔ2. Γij is the transverse decay rate. Gi = μiEi/ℏ is the Rabi frequency of the
incident field Ei. In eqs 1 and 2, we consider the self-dressing effect of E1 and the external-dressing effect of E2 simultaneously.
In this system, the detected signal intensity is the sum of two fluorescence
signals, FL1 and FL2. The density matrix elements of fourth-order
fluorescence are 3   4  where d12 = Γ12 + i(Δ1 – Δ2) and d21 = Γ21 + i(Δ2 – Δ1).

Similarly, in a Λ-type
three-level system, the third-order nonlinear density matrix elements
for Stokes and anti-Stokes signals ES1 and EAS3 are given by 5   6  The density matrix elements of FL1 are 7  where d3 = Γ13 + iΔ3, d30 = Γ03 + i(Δ3 – Δ1), d13 = Γ13 + iΔ1,
and d10′ = Γ01 – iΔ3.

In the experiment,
generated FWM signals are reflected by a polarized beam splitter,
and the vertically polarized component of FWM signals is detected.
So, the effective density matrix elements can be written as ρ(y)(3) = ρ(xxyy)(3) + ρ(yyyy)(3). We use a half-wave plate (HWP)
to modulate the polarization direction of incident field Ei, and the dependence of Rabi frequency
on polarization angle can be described as cx2|Gi|2cos22θ for ρ(xxyy)(3) and cy2|Gi|2sin22θ for ρ(yyyy)(3). When
a quarter-wave plate (QWP) is used to change the polarization state
of incident field, the Rabi frequency is cx2|Gip|2 (cos4 θ + sin4 θ) for ρ(xxyy)(3) and cy2|Gip|2 sin2 θ cos2 θ for ρ(yyyy)(3), respectively, where θ is defined as the rotated
angle of the WP’s axis from the x axis and cx,y is the
anisotropic factor in different directions of crystal. Gip(p =–,0,+) is the Rabi frequency of a pumping field
with left circular, linear, and right circular polarization, respectively.
Different laser polarization states have different Clebsch–Gordan
(CG) coefficients.

When strong pumping fields couple with energy
levels, energy levels will split as induced by the dressing effect.
In the V-type three-level system, ground state |0⟩ is split
into |±⟩ dressing levels by E2. Considering the excitation of pumping field E1 and dressing effect of E2, there
are two spontaneous emissions from |2⟩ to |±⟩ dressing
levels. The wavelength of two spontaneous emissions can be written
as .18 Therefore,
the splitting distance between |+⟩ and |−⟩ is . Moreover, considering the self-dressing effect
of E1, the splitting distance can be expressed
as  when Δ1 = Δ2 = 0. Similarly, in
the Λ-type three-level system, excited state |1⟩ is split
into |±⟩ dressing levels by E3 and E1 with distance .

The linewidth (Γ) of the measured fluorescence signal
is determined by the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and transverse relaxation time (T2), that is, Γ = (2πT1)−1 + (2πT2)−1, where T1 is determined
by the width of energy level and T2 by
the dephasing rate. Considering the dressing level, the broadened
linewidth of the fluorescence signal can be further described as Γ
= Γpop + Γion-spin + Γion-ion + Γphonon – Γ(Δ±), where Γpop = (2πT1)−1 depends on the location of the
energy level in phase space, Γion-spin relates to
the ion-spin coupling effect of the individual ion, and Γion-ion is determined by the interaction among the rare-earth
ions, which can be controlled by the power of external field and impurity
concentration. Phonon relaxation rate is given by Γphonon ∝ 2π[n(ω, T) + 1]/h, where n(ω, T) = 1/[exp(ω/kBT) –
1] is the thermal occupation of phonon mode. So, Γphonon is related to the temperature of the sample. Γ(Δ±) represents the location of the energy level induced
by dressing fields.

In our experiment, the FWM and fourth-order
FL signals were illuminated by the same pumping fields and were generated
simultaneously, so the correlation exists between them. The intensity
noise correlation function G(2)(τ)
can be expressed as 8  where Δφ = φS/AS – φFL, φS/AS is the initial phase of FWM, and
φFL is the dressed phase of fourth-order FL. So,
the correlation functions change with the dressing nonlinear phase
via cross-Kerr effect.

III Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows FL signals in a time domain detected
by photomultiplier tube D3 in Λ-type (Figure 1a–c) and V-type (Figure 1d–f) three-level systems.
There are two peaks in these hybrid signals. The right peak is attributed
to the adiabatic population transfer between dressed states, whereas
the left peak is the contribution of SFWM without adiabatic population
transfer. In the Λ-type three-level system, excited state |1⟩
is split into |G1±⟩ caused
by E1. Dressing level |G1+⟩ is further split into |G2+±⟩ induced by E3. The transfer of population
can occur between dressing levels through phonon-assisted nonradioactive
transition. We attribute the delay of right peak to the transfer of
residual particles between |G2++⟩
and |G1–⟩. The delay time
of right peak is determined by the distance between |G2++⟩ and |G1–⟩. One can see that the delay time decreases with the increase
of temperature both in Λ-type and V-type three-level systems.
This effect results from the competition between dressing and phonon
effects. Phonon relaxation rate Γphonon ∝
2π[n(ω, T) + 1]/h includes pure dephasing contributions from temperature-dependent
phonon scattering. At high temperature, dressed state levels are broadened
by the phonon effect, which causes the splitting distance of dressed
state to decrease. Considering the phonon broadening, we can write
the expression of the splitting distance as . At room temperature,
the dressing effect is balanced by the phonon effect, so two peaks
combine into one peak. At low temperature, phonon relaxation rate
Γphonon decreases, which causes the transition distance
between dressing levels to increase. As a result, the right peak presents
obvious delay. In addition, the proportion of FWM and FL in hybrid
signals also changes with temperature.

states. (a–c) Λ-Type three-level system. (d–f)
V-type three-level system. 1–3 represent linearly polarized,
elliptically polarized, and circularly polarized states of dressing
field, respectively.

Next, we investigate
the polarization-dressing effect on delay time when the dressing field E2 (or E3) is changed by
QWP. At 77 K, when the polarization state of dressing field changes
from circular to linear, one can see that the delay time of right
peak increases. In this case, the splitting distance is replaced by . Because the Rabi frequency of
a linearly polarized state (cx2G2,30) is
greater than that of a circularly polarized state (cx2G2,3+ / 2), the delay time of the linearly polarized state
is longer than that of the circularly polarized state. With the temperature
increasing, polarization dependence of delay time becomes not obvious
because of competition between dressing and phonon effects. Such splitting
and delay hybrid signals can be exploited for all-optical transistor
switching applications.14,19

Figure 2 shows FL signals in a frequency
domain detected at different polarization-dressing states and different
temperatures. The detuning Δ2,3 is set at Δ2,3 = 0, and Δ1 is scanned. One can observe
the obvious decrease in linewidth with temperature decreasing, and
FL curves show Autler–Townes (AT) splitting at low temperature.
The linewidth of the fluorescence signal depends on Γ = Γpop + Γion-spin + Γion-ion + Γphonon – Γ(Δ±), whereas AT splitting is caused by the dressing effect. One can
easily predict that phonon effect Γphonon is dominant
at room temperature, so the linewidth of the FL curve increases. Moreover,
the splitting distance of dressed state level  is decreased because
of the phonon broadening effect, so AT splitting disappears. When
the temperature is below 110K, the phonon effect Γphonon decreases, and the dressing effect is dominant, which result in
obvious AT splitting.

Figure 2 FL composite signals
in a frequency domain detected
at different temperatures and polarization states. 1–3 represent
linearly polarized, elliptically polarized, and circularly polarized
states of dressing field, respectively. (a–c) Λ-Type
three-level system. (d–f) V-type three-level system.

Now, we compare the polarization-dressing
effect on AT splitting when the polarization state of dressing field E2 (or E3) is changed by
QWP. With the rotation angle of QWP changing from 0 to 45°, the
depth of the suppressed dip reduces. The external-dressing effect
of E2,3 on spectra splitting is reflected
by |G2,3|2/d2,3 (in eqs 3 and 7). Because of different CG coefficients,
the dressing effect of the linearly polarized field (cx2|G2,30|2/d2,3) is stronger than that of the circularly polarized field (cx2|G2,3+|2/2d2,3), which leads to the decrease
of AT splitting depth from 0 to 45°.

At room temperature,
AT splitting disappears due to phonon effect. The fluorescence emission
peaks increase gradually from linear to circular polarization in the
Λ-type system. On the contrary, they decrease from linear to
circular polarization in the V-type system. In the Λ-type system,
there is only one signal FL1 from site I, and E3 acts as an external-dressing field. The suppression dressing effect
of linear polarization is stronger than circular polarization, so
fluorescence emission peak increases from linear to circular polarization.
In the V-type system, there are two signals, FL1 and FL2, from sites
I and II, respectively. E3 acts as the external-dressing
field for FL1 and the generating field for FL2 simultaneously. The
generating effect becomes weak from linear to circular polarization,
which causes the intensity of fluorescence emission peak to decrease.

Next, we modulate the fourth-order FL signal by changing the frequency
detuning Δ2 of dressing field (as shown in Figure 3). At 77 K, the FL
peak evolves from AT splitting to pure suppression dip, with Δ2 changing from large detuning to resonance. When Δ2 is tuned close to the resonant point, the dress terms |G2|2/d2 and |G2|2/d12 in eqs 3 and 4 increase. Because of the satisfaction
of suppression condition Δ1 + Δ2 = 0 in the experiment, the suppression effect and AT splitting depth
increase. Because the temperature increased to 110 K, the evolution
of FL peak with frequency detuning Δ2 was less obvious.
This is attributed to the dressing phonon interaction term |G2|2/(Γ20 + iΔ2). With the temperature increasing,
Γ20 is increased because of the phonon broadening
effect, which counteracts the dressing effect. As a result, the spectrum
is less sensitive to the frequency detuning of dressing field at high
temperature. Such controllable splitting and suppression signals have
potential applications in all-optical router and switching devices.

Figure 3 FL composite
signals in a frequency domain detected at different detuning of dressing
field E2 in the V-type three-level system.

Finally, we investigate the intensity noise correlation of hybrid
signals. Correlation properties of hybrid signals can be used to reduce
the noise level of quantum optical devices. Figure 4a,b shows the intensity noise correlation
function G(2)(τ) between Stokes
and FL composite signals at 110 and 77 K, respectively. An HWP is
used to change the polarization direction of E1. When the polarization direction of E1 is
changed from horizontal (0°) to vertical polarization (45°),
we find that the correlation values G(2)(0) decrease both at 77 and 110 K. With θ changing from 0 to
45°, the generating terms cx2|G1|2 in eqs 1 and 3 change to cy2|G1|2, and the intensities
of SFWM and FL signals decrease. As a result, the correlation values
decrease.

Figure 4 (a, b)
Intensity noise correlation function G(2)(τ) between ES and FL signals in the
V-type three-level system detected at (a) 110 K and (b) 77 K, respectively.
The polarization direction of E1 is changed
by HWP.

For correlation curves at 77 K, it is shown obviously
that a sharp peak superimposed on each curve of the correlation at
τ = 0. As shown in Figure 1, FL composite signals have two peaks in the time domain.
The left peak is the contribution of SFWM, whereas the right peak
is caused by the phonon-assisted FL process. The shape of the hybrid
correlation function for SFWM and FL composite signals is determined
by 9  The parameter
ζ represents the bandwidth of the laser source. Correlation
shape is primarily affected by the decay rates Γ of SFWM and
FL signals, and decay rates can be affected by the phonon and dressing
effects. We observe that the shape of correlation curve follows the
intensity of the composite signal and the competition between SFWM
and FL signals. At 77 K, the phonon effect decreases, and the proportion
of SFWM in composite signal is large, so the sharp peak of correlation
curve is more obvious. With the temperature increase, the phonon-assisted
FL process is enhanced, and the proportion of SFWM is reduced. Therefore,
the sharp peak of correlation curve is small.

Figure 5 shows the correlation functions
of ES-FL and ES-EAS at 110 K when a QWP is used to change the polarization
state of E2. In Figure 5a, we find that the maximum correlation between ES and FL is obtained at the linearly polarized
state (θ = 0o). When the polarization state of dressing
field E2 changes from linearly polarized to
right circularly polarized (θ = 45°), the correlation peaks
decrease at first and then switch from correlation to anticorrelation.
This result may be explained by the cross-phase modulation (XPM) induced
by dressing field E2. In eq 8, the nonlinear phase shift between ES and FL can be characterized as Δφ
= 2(kSn2S – kFLn2FL)|E2|2e–r2z/n1, where n2 = Re χ(3)/ε0cn1 is the nonlinear refractive index of the
Kerr medium, r is the beam radius of dressing field,
and z is the length of the YSO crystal. When the
polarization of the dressing field E2 is changed
from linearly polarized to right circularly polarized, the effective
Rabi frequency and third-order effective susceptibility can be modulated.
Therefore, the nonlinear phase shift between ES and FL is changed. Correspondingly, the correlation value switches
from positive to negative.

in the V-type three-level system detected at 110 K. The polarization
state of E2 is changed by QWP. (a) Correlation
between Stokes and fluorescence signals (ES-FL). (b) Correlation between Stokes and anti-Stokes signals (ES-EAS).

Figure 5b shows the correlation functions between ES and EAS signals. When
the polarization state of E2 changes from
linearly polarized to circularly polarized, the correlation value G(2)(0) decreases first and then increases at
45°. G(2)(0) achieves its minimum
value at an elliptically polarized state. The variation of G(2)(0) results from the competition between
gain and dressing effect of E2. Moreover,
anticorrelation effect was not observed between ES and EAS. For the SFWM process, it
is insensitive to dressing effect, and the phase difference between ES and EAS is smaller because
of the coherent nature as compared to the incoherent FL signal. So,
all values of G(2)(0) are positive.

IV Conclusions
In
summary, we have investigated hybrid signals including fourth-order
fluorescence and SFWM in both time and frequency domains at different
temperatures and modulated by different polarization-dressing fields.
By changing the experiment temperature and polarization states of
dressing fields, the delay time, AT splitting, and proportion of SFWM
and FL in hybrid signals are modulated desirably. Our experiment data
are in good agreement with the theoretical results of competition
between polarization-dressing and phonon effects.

In addition,
the polarization dependences of hybrid correlation are compared at
different temperatures. It is found that the competition between SFWM
and FL signals determines the correlation shape and can be modulated
by dressing and phonon effects. The switches between correlation and
anticorrelation of hybrid signals are observed at different polarization
states and attributed to cross-phase modulation induced by the dressing
field. Our results demonstrate that phonon effect can significantly
affect the nonlinear response of quantum optical devices. The dressing
phonon interaction plays a vital role in determining the controlling
parameters of quantum optical devices.

V Experimental Setup
Our experiments are carried
out in a rare-earth Pr3+-doped Y2SiO5 crystal, the concentration of Pr3+ ion is about 0.05
atom %. The energy levels 3H4 and 1D2 of Pr3+ ion are selected to couple with the pumping field. There are two
crystallographic sites (denoted as sites I and II) of Pr3+ ions in the Y2SiO5 crystal; Figure 6a shows their energy levels.
Because two crystallographic sites have different Stark splitting,
we can detect two fluorescence signals, FL1 (γ0 to
δ0) and FL2 (γ0* to δ0*). Because of the dipole–dipole interactions,
we treat ions Pr3+(I) and Pr3+(II) as heteronuclear
molecules. Therefore, we can construct the Λ-type three-level
|0⟩ ↔ |1⟩ ↔ |3⟩ (Figure 6c) and V-type three-level |0⟩
↔ |1⟩ ↔ |2⟩ systems.

systems in Pr3+:Y2SiO5.

The experimental
setup is shown in Figure 6b. As pumping fields, we used three tunable dye lasers (narrow
scan with a 0.04 cm–1 linewidth) pumped by an injection-locked
single-mode Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Powerlite DLS 9010, 10 Hz repetition
rate, 5 ns pulse width). The pumping fields E1 (ω1, Δ1), E2 (ω2, Δ2), and E3 (ω3, Δ3) have the frequency
detuning Δi = ωmn – ωi (i = 1, 2, and 3), where ωmn denotes the corresponding
atomic transition frequency and ωi is the laser frequency. Two strong beams, E1 and E2 (or E3),
counter-propagate through the YSO crystal, and the generated forward
Stokes ES and backward anti-Stokes EAS signals satisfy the phase-matching condition k1 + k2,3 = kS1 + kAS2,3, where k1,2 is the wavevector of the pumping fields and kS, AS is the wavevector of generated ES and EAS beams. The FL signal
can be detected at any direction, but it diminishes quickly with distance.
To detect pure SFWM signals, two photomultiplier tubes (D1 and D2)
are placed at far position, where fluorescence almost vanished. Another
PMT (D3) placed at near position is used to collect the hybrid signal
(FL + SFWM). The polarization state of pumping fields is changed by
quarter-wave plate (QWP) and half-wave plate (HWP).
