Determination
of cystine in blood and urine is very important to
monitor and maintain the bio metabolism, immune systems, and prevent
the tissue/DNA damage from free radicals, diagnosis of cystinuria
disease, cancer, and related autoimmune diseases. Among the various
detection methods, fluorometric detection is simple, rapid, and sensitive
to cystine using nontoxic, inexpensive, highly fluorescent, stable
carbon quantum dots (CQDs). The CQDs are prepared from p-phenylenediamine by the hydrothermal method to get the inherent
optical features of pH-dependent and excitation wavelength-independent
fluorescence emission along with high aqueous stability due to pre-eminent
nitrogen content. The red emission of CQDs originates from the intrinsic
core that is associated with photoinduced electron transfer (PET).
The turn-on fluorescence observed in presence of cystine is due to
decrease in the PET by oxidation of CQDs. On the basis of this observation,
we have developed an assay for the determination of cystine with a
concentration range of 10 nM to 10 μM and the limit of detection
is 0.4 nM. Additionally, our assay shows good recoveries (93–105%)
for the spiked blood plasma and urine samples using the standard addition
method.

1 Introduction
Fluorescent
nanomaterials have received increased attention in
recent years due to their usage in a wide range of biomedical applications,
like biosensing, bioimaging, diagnosis, drug delivery, and nanomedicine.1−6 Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a new class of carbon-based fluorescent
materials that show high photostability against photoblinking/bleaching,
high aqueous solubility, and high fluorescence quantum yield among
the graphene quantum dots, graphene oxide quantum dots, and carbon
nanodots.7−9 Mostly, the fluorescence of CQDs depends on pH of
the medium due to their surface functional groups like carboxylic
acid and amines. Moreover, the fluorescence emission wavelength of
CQDs depends on the excitation wavelength due to the existence of
surface defects/states that offer the multicolor emission. If the
surface defects/states are passivated by other groups like polymers
or oligomers, the fluorescence originating from the electronic transition
of intrinsic carbon core of the CQDs due to a quantum confinement
effect leads to the excitation-independent fluorescence emission.10 The surface passivation also helps to enhance
the fluorescence intensity. Nitrogen-containing groups like amines
are known to be the best passivating agents. Even though we have achieved
the preparation methods to synthesize CQDs with high fluorescent quantum
yield, only the blue color-emitting CQDs are often obtained and widely
reported. The slight redshift in emission wavelengths was attained
by the co-doping of sulfur, nitrogen, or phosphorus compared with
single-element doping.11−13 The excitation-independent green- or red-emitting
CQDs are very selective and are reported in this work.

p-Phenylenediamine
(pPD) easily undergoes polymerization
reaction, and the poly-p-phenylenediamine (PpPD) is structurally similar to polyaniline that is widely
studied and used in many fields, like energy production and storage,
catalysis, and sensing.14−18 The PpPD is used for the surface-passivating agent
for the carbon particles to get fluorescence emission in carbon particles.19 Jiang et al. reported the blue-, green-, and
red-emitting carbon dots synthesized from ortho-, meta-, and para-phenylenediamine, respectively,
by the solvothermal method.20 Ding et al.
reported the carbon dots derived from pPD along with
another precursor uria by a hydrothermal method for multicolor emission
by increasing oxygen moieties on their surfaces.21 We have to synthesize CQDs from the only pPD by the hydrothermal method to get high fluorescence emission at
a longer wavelength. Additionally, we have demonstrated their application
in biosensing, especially for the selective and sensitive determination
of cystine (SS-Cys). Cystine is a dimeric form of cysteine (S-Cys),
generated by oxidation of cysteine. Cysteine was connected through
a sulfide bond while getting oxidized. Cystine is found in many biological
parts, such as skeleton, skin, connective tissues, digestive enzymes,
immune system, and hair. Cystine is converted into cysteine by cystine
reductase, and it is used in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). Therefore,
the increased glutathione level in liver, lungs, kidneys, and bone
marrow helps in reducing the age spots (antiaging effect). Cystine
is an antioxidant that prevents the DNA and tissue from free radical/reactive
oxygen species attack. It is used to control cancer and similar autoimmune
diseases. Also the excess concentration of cystine typically >400
mg/L in urine, leads to cystinuria, a congenital metabolic disease.
Cystinuria disease can be characterized via detection of cystine stones
in renal tract.22 Very few reports are
available for the detection of cystine using techniques such as chromatography,23 iodometry,24 spectrophotometry,25 colorimetry,22,26,27 and spectroflurometry.28 For example, Lu et al. reported the detection of cystine by ascorbic
acid (AA)-induced reduction of cystine in gold nanoparticle dispersion,
leading to aggregation-caused color changes.22 Wang et al reported the detection of cystine by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using dansyl chloride derivatives in
reversed phase column with the use of isocratic elution.23 These techniques have certain limitations like
relatively lower sensitivity, high expense, difficult handling, toxic
reagent usage, interference with other thiols, and time consumption.
Therefore, selective and sensitive determination of cystine is very
important in the current decade for quick screening and diagnosis
of listed diseases.

Here, we have prepared red color-emitting,
excitation-independent,
pH-sensitive, nitrogen-doped amine-functionalized carbon quantum dots
from pPD by a hydrothermal method for the fluorescence
turn-on determination of cystine. The CQDs are clearly characterized
with the help of various spectroscopic and electron microscopic studies.
The optical properties of CQDs were extensively studied and distinguished
and compared to those of similar CQDs available in the literature.
The excitation-independent red emission in CQDs was observed without
any hard synthesis procedure for the first time to the best of our
knowledge. Further, the CQDs are used as a fluorescence probe to quantify
the cystine in the laboratory and real samples. The sensing mechanism
is explained with the help of fluorescence/ζ-potential studies.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization and Optical
Properties
Initially, three CQDs are prepared by hydrothermal
treatment of pPD (the concentrations of pPD were 0.1,
1.0, and 10.0%) at 140 °C for 16 h. The UV–vis and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of those CQDs are depicted in Figure 1a,b. In Figure 1a, we can see three peaks appearing at 196,
239, and 304 nm due to σ–σ*, n−σ*,
and π–π* transition of amines (C-NH2) and aromatic carbon bonds (C=C) along with heteroatoms like
nitrogen (C=N). The peak around ∼500 nm is attributed
to n−π* transition of C=N groups that are present
in CQDs prepared from 0.1% pPD. This peak shifted
to a higher wavelength (up to 510 nm) with increasing concentration
of pPD (Figure 1c). The increased concentration of nitrogen content
leads to shifting of the wavelength to higher wavelength.29 The higher amount of nitrogen doping enhances
the fluorescence intensity and quantum yield.30 The highest absorbance wavelength (530 nm) was observed for the
CQDs prepared by a lower reaction time (4 h). Similarly, the lowest
wavelength (500 nm) was observed for the CQDs prepared by a higher
reaction time (24 h). Therefore, this absorbance wavelength is inversely
proportional to reaction time, which means increasing the reaction
time leads to a blueshift in the absorbance wavelength. The higher
absorbance wavelength denotes the effective nitrogen doping on CQDs,29 whereas as seen in the UV–vis absorbance
spectra of CQDs (prepared at higher temperature, i.e., 180 °C),
the wavelength is shifted to a lower wavelength (500 nm) due to lack
of nitrogen doping. This observation coincided with the literature
wherein it is proposing that the nitrogen doping is effective while
synthesizing at a lower temperature than at higher temperature.31,32 Therefore, the nitrogen doping is effective at a lower reaction
temperature, lower reaction time, and higher concentration of precursor
(pPD). The fluorescence spectra are recorded at different
excitation wavelengths from 440 to 580 nm for CQDs (Figure 1d). The maximum emission intensity
is observed at 618 nm at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. The emission
wavelength does not change with the excitation wavelength, which means
the CQDs’ excitation-independent emission nature may be due
to uniform size, the absence of surface defects/states or those surface
defects being passivated by nitrogen doping, and amine functionalization.
Amines/nitrogen are known to be the best passivating groups.7 From the results, we have selected the excitation/emission
wavelengths for CQDs as 480/618 nm. PL spectra of all CQDs are shown
in Figure 1b; we have
observed that the CQDs that are prepared from 1.0% pPD at 140 °C for 16 h give maximum fluorescence emission intensity
among all other CQDs. The increasing concentration of nitrogen content
in CQDs leads to increasing fluorescence intensity. Additionally,
the fluorescence quantum yield of all CQDs is calculated and tabulated
as Table 1 with that
experimental condition. From the table, we have selected CQDs that
are synthesized from 1.0% pPD at 140 °C for
16 h under hydrothermal method on the basis of high quantum yield,
for further studies.

spectra of CQDs prepared by hydrothermal treatment of 1.0% pPD at 140 °C for 16 h, at various excitation wavelengths

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Studies
The FTIR spectra
of CQDs is depicted in Figure 2a. The characteristic stretching vibration of C=O,
aromatic C=C, primary, and secondary amine groups (C–N)
are observed at 1739, 1629, 1029, and 1109 cm–1,
respectively. It is important to note that the presence of C=O
in CQDs confirms the formation of CQDs whereas pPD
does not have the C=O vibrational frequency (Figure S1). Moreover, the C=O is present in CQDs as
a six-membered ring lactone form, unlike carboxylic acid.33 The peak at 1456 cm–1 is assigned
to the bending vibrational frequency of N–H bond. The peaks
at 2854 and 2930 cm–1 are assigned to C–H
bond of aromatic carbon (C–C–H) and nitrogen/oxygen
(N–C–H/O–C–H), respectively. The wavenumber
of C=C bond in CQDs was decreased from the wavenumber of C=C
of pPD (1637 cm–1) about 10 cm–1 due to increasing the π-conjugation. The peak
at 1260 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching frequency
of aromatic ethers like C–O bond. Additionally, the peak at
3433 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching frequency
of N–H of aromatic primary amines that are present on surfaces
of CQDs. These functional groups are further proved with the help
of XPS spectra. The XPS full survey spectrum of CQDs is plotted in Figure S2. It shows three peaks around 284 eV
(82%), 400 eV (11%), and 531 eV (7%) due to C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s,
respectively. As shown in Figure 2b, the C 1s peak can be deconvoluted into three peaks
by Gaussian fit, at 284.6 eV (42%), 285.7 eV (36%), and 288.0 eV (4.0%).
These peaks can be assigned to C–C/C=C, C–N,
and C=N/C=O, respectively.7,32 We don’t
find any highly oxidized carbon groups like carboxylic acid in high-resolution
C 1s XPS spectrum. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2c, the N 1s peak can be deconvoluted into
two peaks by Gaussian fit at 398.4 eV (4.0%) and 399.3 eV (7.0%).
These peaks are assigned to pyridinic nitrogen and terminal amine
groups.7,21 As well as the O 1s peak can be deconvoluted
into only one peak by Gaussian fit, which can be assigned to keto
groups of CQDs possibly present on their surfaces (Figure 2d). Therefore, the synthesized
material is nitrogen-doped amino-dominant carbon quantum dots. These
functional groups are used to enhance the aqueous dispersibility and
stability.

X-ray photoelectron spectra of CQDs.

2.3 Topological Studies
The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of CQDs is shown in Figure 3a. The dots are uniformly
dispersed and highly stable in an aqueous medium. The size of CQDs
is measured from 3 to 8 nm, and the distribution curve shows the average
size of dots as 5 nm (Figure 3b). At higher magnification, we have found fringes for a single
dot, as shown in Figure 3c. From the fringes, we calculated the d-spacing
and matched with the similar carbon material. The calculated d-spacing values are 0.203 and 0.215 nm that can be assigned
to (101) and (100) planes of graphitic carbon (JCPDS: 00-001-0640).
Moreover, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of
CQDs shows the d-spacing of 0.123 and 0.203 nm in Figure 3d. These d spacings
can be assigned to (110) and (101) planes of the graphitic carbon
material (JCPDS: 00-001-0640). The HRTEM images and SAED pattern established
that the formed product is highly ordered graphitic carbon quantum
dots.

2.4 Effect of pH Value
The fluorescence
properties at acidic, neutral, and basic pH were studied. The fluorescence
intensity is increased with decreasing pH, as depicted in Figure 4a. The pyridinic
nitrogen at basic condition having lone pair of electrons on the outside
of pyridinic ring plane. The lone pair of electrons present in the
pyridinic ring will undergo nonradiative recombination via photoinduced
electron transfer (PET) process.34 Therefore,
the fluorescence intensity decreased at higher pH. The pyrrolic nitrogen
donates their lone pair of electrons to the pyrrolic ring that is
embedded within the graphitic framework. At lower pH, there is no
free loan pair electron to involve PET process. Therefore, pyridinic
ring is the reason for the decreasing fluorescence intensity with
increasing pH. At acidic pH, the pyridinic nitrogen gets protonated,
leading to nonavailability of the free lone pair of electrons. So
nonradiative recombination through PET will not be possible. Therefore,
we have observed an enhancement in fluorescence at acidic pH. In the
case of basic pH, we have a number of lone pair of electrons in pyridinic
nitrogen and the rate of PET is very high, leading to quenching of
the fluorescence. The rate of PET increased with increasing pH, leading
to decrease in the fluorescence intensity. The stability of fluorescence
emission was also investigated to understand the photobleaching or
photoblinking effect prior to probing it. The PL spectra of CQDs at
different time intervals shows negligible changes in fluorescence
intensity (Figure S3). The fluorescence
intensity at excitation/emission wavelength of 480/618 nm is plotted
with respect to time in Figure 4b. This plot confirms that the fluorescence of CQDs is more
stable over 30 min, which is sufficient for biosensing and bioimaging
studies in natural samples.

Figure 4 (a) PL spectra of CQDs at various pH, i.e.,
1.5, 7.0, and 12.0
using excitation wavelength of 480 nm, (b) PL intensities of CQDs
with increasing time at excitation/emission wavelength of 480/618
nm.

2.5 Selective
Determination of Cystine
Figure 5a shows the
PL intensity of CQDs at excitation/emission wavelengths of 480/618
nm along with 100 μM concentrations of various biomolecules,
such as ascorbic acid, uric acid (UA), dopamine (DA), cysteine, glutathione,
folic acid (FA), and glucose (GOH), along with 10 μM cystine.
The fluorescence intensity of CQDs with these biomolecules is decreased
from that of CQDs alone. But the fluorescence intensity of CQDs with
cystine is greatly increased. The mechanism for the fluorescence enhancement
can be ascribed to decreasing the PET of CQDs by cystine via oxidation
of CQDs. Meanwhile, cystine reduced into cysteine, which does not
noticeably interfere the fluorescence of CQDs. As we know, the PET
process will decrease the fluorescence due to lone pair of electrons
of pyridinic nitrogen of CQDs. After adding cystine, the lone pair
of electrons of pyridinic nitrogen are decreased due to oxidation
of CQDs by cystine. Therefore, the amount of PET is decreased in CQDs
and fluorescence intensity of CQDs is enhanced. The oxidation of CQDs
is confirmed by ζ-potential measurement, which is based on the
surface charge of CQDs. The ζ-potential of CQDs is found to
be −45.0 mV, which shows excellent stability and increases
from −45.0 to −1.5 mV after addition of 10 μM
cystine (Figure 5b).
It is possible that only the lone pair of electron gets eliminated
or protonated (openly saying that both are oxidation reactions). The
increment in ζ-potential without the addition of organic/inorganic
acids is ascribed to oxidation of CQDs by cystine; meanwhile, cystine
gets reduced into cysteine. Therefore, the CQDs exist in oxidized
form after addition of cystine. On the basis of this observation,
we have added various concentrations of cystine from 10 nM to 10 μM
to CQDs. The PL spectra are recorded for these samples under optimized
experimental/instrumental conditions and shown in Figure 5c. The fluorescence intensity
was gradually increased with increasing concentration of cystine.
The corresponding calibration curve is plotted in Figure 5d. The linear range for the
determination of cystine is 10 nM to 10 μM, and the limit of
detection (LOD) is 0.39 nM. The sensing method, linearity, LOD, and
probes in other reports are compared with our method in Table 2. From this table, it is clear,
our sensing probe is the best for the selective determination of cystine.
Therefore, we have studied the real sample analysis using urine and
blood plasma.

2.6 Determination of Cystine in Blood and Urine
Samples
We have followed the standard addition method for
the determination of cystine in both blood plasma and urine samples
to minimize the matrix-interfering components. We have chosen spiked
blood plasma and urine samples as a model for the validation of our
method through the standard addition method, due to nonavailability
of a commercialized cystine assay kit. Human blood plasma and urine
samples were collected from CSIR-CECRI health center. One micromolar
and two micromolar concentrations of cystine were spiked to sample
1 and sample 2, respectively. These samples were centrifuged at RCF
8000g for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken for
analyses after 100-fold dilution with MilliQ water to minimize the
common interfering molecules. The fluorescence spectra were recorded
at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission intensity monitored
at 618 nm of wavelength. Then, we have added a series concentration
of cystine from 100 to 500 nM to the same samples. The same procedure
was followed for the determination of cystine in urine samples. From
the collected data of triplicate experiments, we have found the concentrations
of spiked samples using the plots (Figure S4a–d) and the values are tabled as Table 3. The linear regression coefficient of 0.99 with good
recoveries from 93 to 105% for those experiments via standard addition
method has confirmed the possibility of device fabrication for cystine
detection on commercial application. However, the lone pair of electrons
of pyridinic nitrogen of CQDs protonated at acidic pH condition. The
fluorescence intensity is enhanced due to decreased photoinduced electron
transfer (Figure 4a).
Therefore, acidic medium/contaminant should be avoided to get accurate
results for cystine detection in natural samples. This limitation
should be considered while making an analytical assay kit.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized red emitted carbon quantum dots
from p-phenylenediamine by hydrothermal method. The
CQDs have unique photoluminescence properties, like high quantum yield,
wide excitation wavelength for monochromatic emission, pH-sensitive
emission, etc. The photoinduced electron transfer-caused fluorescence
quenching was found in the CQDs due to the presence of lone pair of
electrons of the pyridinic nitrogen. The lone pair of electrons of
pyridinic nitrogen in CQDs was decreased via oxidation of CQDs by
cystine, leading to fluorescence enhancement. Using the fluorescence
turn-on mechanism, we have developed an assay method for the determination
of cystine in the concentration range of 10 nM to 10 μM. Additionally,
the methodology was successfully used to find the concentration of
spiked human blood plasma and urine samples with good recoveries (93–105%).
Therefore, this method has the potential for determination of cystine
in presence of major interfering compounds due to unique advantages,
like high stability, inexpensiveness, rapid analysis, easy handling,
etc.; thus, it can be a useful tool in bioanalytical chemistry.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
p-Phenylenediamine (pPD), uric
acid (UA), cysteine
(S-Cys), cystine (SS-Cys), and folic acid (FA) were purchased from
SRL, India. Glutathione (GSH), dopamine (DA), glucose (GOH), and vitamin
B12 (VitB12) are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
and ascorbic acid (AA) are purchased from MERCK. All compounds are
analytical grade and used without further purification. All solutions
are made in MilliQ water (18.2 MΩ cm).

4.2 Synthesis
of CQDs
To synthesize CQDs,
30 mL of different concentrations of pPD are prepared
using MilliQ water (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0%) and transferred into an autoclave
(50 mL capacity). The autoclaves are kept in the furnace and maintained
at different temperatures (140 and 180 °C, to understand the
effect of temperature on the formation of CQDs) for different times
(4, 10, 16, and 24 h, to understand the effect of reaction time on
the formation of CQDs). After completion of the reaction, the autoclaves
are allowed to cool at room temperature. The prepared samples are
filtered using a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) syringe filter,
followed by 2 kDa cellulose dialysis tubing. The collected samples
are initially analyzed by UV–vis and PL spectroscopy to calculate
the quantum yield. The CQDs with high quantum yield were taken for
further characterization and analytical studies. The quantum yield
of CQDs prepared by different experimental conditions is tabulated
as Table 1. The sample
preparation procedure of various spectroscopic and electron microscopic
analyses are explained in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Determination of Cystine and Interference
Studies
Three milliliters of CQDs was taken into a quartz
cuvette for the fluorescence measurement. An appropriate volume of
aqueous cystine solution was added to 3 mL of CQDs to make the final
concentration of cystine in a cuvette from 10 nM to 10 μM. The
PL spectra recorded at 480 nm of excitation wavelength with an emission
wavelength window of 500–900 nm. The fluorescence intensities
at 618 nm of emission wavelength with respect to cystine concentration
were taken for the calibration plot. Similarly, 100 μM concentrations
of various biomolecules, such as ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA),
dopamine (DA), cysteine (S-Cys), glutathione (GSH), folic acid (FA),
and glucose (GOH), along with 10 μM cystine (SS-Cys) were added
to each 3 mL of CQDs in a quartz cuvette. The fluorescence emission
intensities are directly recorded at excitation/emission wavelengths
of 480/618 nm.
