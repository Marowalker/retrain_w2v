The sequence fitness
of a llama single-domain antibody with an
unusually high thermal stability is explored by a combined computational
and experimental study. Starting with the X-ray crystallographic structure,
RosettaBackrub simulations were applied to model sequence–structure
tolerance profiles and identify key substitution sites. From the model
calculations, an experimental site-directed mutagenesis was used to
produce a panel of mutants, and their melting temperatures were determined
by thermal denaturation. The results reveal a sequence fitness of
an excess stability of approximately 12 °C, a value taken from
a decrease in the melting temperature of an electrostatic charge-reversal
substitution in the CRD3 without a deleterious effect on the binding
affinity to the antigen. The tolerance for the disruption of antigen
recognition without loss in the thermal stability was demonstrated
by the introduction of a proline in place of a tyrosine in the CDR2,
producing a mutant that eliminated binding. To further assist the
sequence design and the selection of engineered single-domain antibodies,
an assessment of different computational strategies is provided of
their accuracy in the detection of substitution “hot spots”
in the sequence tolerance landscape.

1 Introduction
A combinatorial optimization
of amino acid sequences to fit a topological
protein fold takes place on comparability landscapes with the fitness
measured by scaling factors.1 From an experimental
perspective, sequence–structure tolerance is typically probed
by site-directed mutagenesis studies, and the landscape is thermal
stability and conservation of function. A common observation of mutational
studies is the remarkable plasticity of protein structures to amino
acid changes and how large the sequence envelope is for particular
fold families.

A well-known class of protein folds that occupies
a superfamily
of sequences is the N-terminal domains of both the heavy and light
chains of the variable region of antibodies. A popular construct of
the heavy chain is single-domain antibody (sdAb) chains derived from
camelids. The interest in sdAbs lies in their biotechnological applications
that require an evaluated thermal stability and reversible folding
as well as a high affinity and singularity of molecular recognition.2−7

Typical sdAbs have melting transition temperatures (Tm) in the range of 60–70 °C.2−5 An outlier is a llama sdAb specific for Staphylococcus
aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), which has a reported Tm of 85 °C.2 The first available X-ray crystallographic structure of this unusually
stable sdAb (designated as A3) revealed an asymmetrical homodimeric
assembly of conformers displaying differences in the secondary structure
geometry and local connectivity.8 The fold
topology of each chain is the common assembly of two β sheets
with a β-sandwich arrangement. Structural alignment search with
Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries shows strong neighbors in the fold
space with high Z-score matches with other antibody
structures.

From a computational perspective, the effect of
a mutation on Tm can be calculated from
all-atom simulations
of the thermodynamic folding–unfolding dynamics that govern
the heat capacity or melting curve.1,9−11 Alternatively, an alchemical process of residue mutation can be
modeled by using the free energy perturbation theory applied to a
cycle of the folded and unfolded states to determine changes in the
free energy of the folding stability.12−14 Although both modeling
methods are rigorous, they are computationally prohibitive when applied
to a large set of mutants for proteins of moderate size or larger.
Because of this drawback, algorithms have been developed with energy
functions specifically parameterized to predict differences in the
folding free energy due to point mutations. Examples include Site-Directed
Mutator (SDM),15 I-Mutant3.0,16 FoldX,17 PoPMuSiC,18 and PreTherMut,19 among others.20,21 Typically, these algorithms are
empirically weighted using the data obtained from protein engineering
experiments, and their predicted free energy changes are correlated
to experimental differences in the folding free energy.

Here,
this work presents a combined computational and experimental
study of identifying residue contributions that govern the unusually
high Tm of A3. Our earlier study reported
several alanine substitutions and their application in comparative
modeling methods to assess predictions of the thermal stability.22 The computational strategy here is different
and is based on RosettaBackrub simulations23,24 to model the sequence–structure tolerance landscape and generate
conformations for a set of amino acid substitutions including nonalanine
mutations. Ranking of the mutants and their conformations is based
on the application of the empirical energy function Rosetta and an
alternative all-atom statistical potential. From our computational
analysis, we apply site-directed mutagenesis to generate a panel of
mutants that occupy structural regions identified as possible sequence
“hot spots” and to evaluate the accuracy of modeling
stability. Each mutant is experimentally characterized by their change
in Tm relative to the wild-type (WT) A3
monomer and, unlike previous work,22 their
binding affinity to the protein target SEB is reported. The latter
is important in understanding the sequence tolerance of conserving
protein function.

As a part of our computation design study
of A3, we provide an
assessment of knowledge-based and empirical prediction methods. Rather
than the more conventional approach of predicting the correlation
between an energy function and experimental folding free energies,
we focus primarily on the often occurring case where the only available
experimental data from protein engineering are Tm measurements for selected mutations. The observed nature
of constructing a relationship between the Tm and the folding free energy (measured near or below 300 K)
is nicely illustrated by the experimental study on the miniprotein
Trp-cage with multiple sequence mutations.25 The relationship depends on the condition of unfolding–folding
reversibility, an observation derived from the intrinsic physical
properties of each protein under investigation as well as the experimental
conditions of the denaturation.

Although our assessment of computational
prediction schemes is
not an exhaustive study, the analysis includes several widely popular
web-based methods for modeling changes in the thermal stability and
will be helpful to researchers working on similar problems on designing
sdAb constructs. Included in our analysis is the rescoring of structures
generated by the RosettaBackrub simulations using a highly benchmarked
statistical potential function. Building upon the conformational ensemble
produced from the RosettaBackrub, we also examine an approximation
that corrects the statistical potential for molecular electrostatics
of solvent interactions and their changes arising from the mutations
by the addition of a weighted implicit solvent model. Taken together,
our study of mutations of an sdAb offers an excellent assessment of
the benefits and limitations of in silico methods applied to the rational
design of antibody fragments.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Features of A3
The X-ray
crystallographic structure of the llama A3 sdAb in a homodimeric form
is illustrated in Figure 1. The structure displays an unusual asymmetric assembly of
two conformers (denoted as A and B chains) that differ in their secondary
structure and, as noted in the published report, the dimerization
has important implications for conformational misfolding.8 Additional crystallographic structures of A3
as monomeric chains have been determined, and the set includes several
site-specific mutations.8 As reported in
the crystallographic work, the protein production of the homodimer
as opposed to the monomer is attributed to the cytoplasmic expression
versus periplasmic.8 Structural differences
among the conformers are centered primarily within the α-helical
region containing residue F29 of the highly variable complementarity
determining region CDR1 and residues S50–Y60 of the region
linking the β-strands of the CDR2. The dimeric interface consists
of residues 113–121 of the CDR3 loop as well as E44 and R45
of a variable β-hairpin and Y98 of the framework.

and the right sequence differences. The color spectrum runs from red
to blue, where red designates structural and/or sequence conservation,
whereas blue shows divergence. (c) Alignments of the B-chain with
sdAbs 3STB and 1I3V.

A structural alignment search of the A and B chains
was performed
by the Dali algorithm26 to detect regions
of the structural and sequence divergence. The significance of these
regions is they offer substitution sites for exploring the sequence
fitness that underlie the high Tm. The
choice of applying chains from the dimeric assembly rather than a
monomer is to capture a wider range of conformational plasticity among
the crystallographic conformers. The search finds, as anticipated
from the large data set of known immunoglobulins, greater than 1000
structural neighbors with high Z-scores and sequence
identities that span the range from a high of 77% to a low 6%. Shown
in Figure 1b,c are
the high Z-score ranking sdAb hits of PDB entries 3STB and 1I3V with sequence identities
of roughly 77 and 66%, respectively. Among the multiple neighbors
observed from Dali, the pairwise alignments show a structural variability
in the length and placement of the α-helix for residues 26–32,
β-turn region centered at P55, and the loop region of roughly
98–110.

To explore the relationship between the Dali
search results and
the sequence fitness of structural regions to amino acid substitutions,
we calculated the sequence–tolerance profiles that contribute
to the fold stability of the conformers by the RosettaBackrub simulation
method.23,24 RosettaBackrub is a structure-based modeling
approach where the sequence tolerance is depended on the structural
details surrounding a selected sequence location site. Unlike many
coarse-grained simulation strategies, the RosettaBackrub models the
protein chain at a resolution that detects local conformational differences
on the sequence fitness. Illustrated in Figure 2 is a subset of the residue-specific profiles
determined for the A and B conformers taken from the dimer. Shown
are regions F29–M34, P55–Y60, and Y98–K104 that
model the sequence tolerance between the conformers near or within
the CDRs.22 Additional profiles are shown
in Figure 3 for an
alternative starting conformer and includes extended regions D102–M111
and N112–Y118. The profiles report the ranking of amino acids
for each sequence position by a predicted frequency of site population.
Wild-type (WT) residues are shown in red, and the dashed line indicates
a cutoff of picking the top five amino acid choices at each position.

Figure 2 Selected
sequence–tolerance profiles of the A-chain conformer
(top graph) and B-chain conformer (bottom graph) of A3 determined
by the RosettaBackrub method. Sequences colored red denote the wild-type
residue. The color spectrum of each profile designates the predicted
frequency of the sequence-site placement along the A- or B-chain conformers.
The horizontal line is arbitrarily positioned to highlight the five
top-ranking sequences.

Figure 3 Sequence–tolerance profiles for an alternative single-chain
conformer of A3 to further illustrate the effect of the variability
arising from different conformations. Added profile regions include
D102–M111 and N112–Y118. The description is similar
to that given in Figure 2.

The profiles show the variation
between the conformers at specific
sequence sites where structural differences are most evident. One
example is the Y59–Y60 segment shown in Figure 2, where the aromatic rings are less favorable
in population for the A-chain conformer and are located in an unstructured
topology, whereas a β-strand is found for the B-chain. Similarly, Figure 3 shows Y59–Y60
to populate high-frequency placements at their conformational positions
along the chain. Despite the structural differences between the conformers,
WT residues with high favorable ranking are observed for many sites,
suggesting a strong sequence-fold comparability fitness. For example,
the structural topology at position F29 is a helical fold populated
among the conformers with the only exception being the dimeric A-chain,
yet the WT phenylalanine is nearly equivalent in the sequence ranking
for all chains. Conversely, the WT residue P55, which is located in
a β-turn region of the high structural divergence among the
Dali search results, shows low population frequency for both A and
B conformers (Figure 2). Contrasting rankings are observed for charged residues D102 and
K104, where the negative charge is among the top-ranked populations
for the set of conformers, whereas the positive charge varies in the
sequence ranking (Figures 2 and 3).

2.2 Experimental
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
To test the computed tolerance
profiles and the effect of structural
variability observed from the Dali search results, a panel of substitutions
for experimental site-directed mutagenesis was designed and included
18 mutations (listed in Table 1). The criteria for which sites to select for substitution
and the residue type was based on the output of RosettaBackrub simulations
of evaluating an exhaustive number of substitutions. The final set
was down selected for exploring the following: (1) destabilization
of the helical-connecting region between S25 and F29 of CDR1; (2)
conformational flexibility of CDR2 positioned at P55 and its poor
tolerance score; (3) divergent placement of Y59 in the A and B chains
and overall rank; (4) placement of charged and nonpolar groups in
the largely unstructured CDR3 of residues D102–V116; and (5)
overall sequence conservation. Although the mutants are nearly all
single-point substitutions, the selection provides a sufficient probe
into the sequence tolerance of function and stability. Substitutions
outside of the predicted profiles were modeled from the crystallographic
structures.

Thermal denaturation curves were determined for each
protein mutant
along with their binding kinetics to SEB to ensure proper folding,
as determined by their ability to recognize the antigen. The WT and
all mutant proteins were produced as monomers, thus eliminating possible
complications arising from the dimerization. Representative circular
dichroism (CD) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data are shown
in Figure 4 (see also
the Supporting Information). With the exception
of the Y59P, all of the mutants retained their binding function and
most recognized SEB with near wild-type affinities. The mutations
at P55 and Y59 may affect the conformation of CDR2 (see Figure 1), which was previously shown
to provide critical interactions between A3 and SEB.3 The melting transition temperatures were compared to the
WT form.

curves of A3 mutants F29L (blue) and Y98A (green). Vertical lines
have been drawn through the inflection points, dotted for Y98A and
solid for F29L. Middle and lower graphs are SPR data for mutants P55S
and D102R. The on rate, off rate and calculated dissociation constant
(KD) of A3 binding the target SEB are
shown above the data for these mutants.

Although the tolerance profiles from RosettaBackrub are not
absolute
in ranking sequence frequencies, it is of interest to generally place
the experimental measured results in the context of the computed profiles
and apply the ideas of protein fitness.1 Among the mutants, an asymptotic margin or threshold robustness
of excess configurational stability can be estimated from the substitutions
which retained the functional property of native-like binding to the
antigen SEB. The most remarkable outcome is the electrostatic charge-reversal
D102R in CDR3, which showed a significant drop of 12 °C in the Tm compared to the WT form and demonstrated a
native-like KD (Table 1). The D102R Tm brings the stability excess near the upper bound that is typical
of other sdAbs. Additional mutants with an excess stability of ∼10
°C include R70A and Y98A, both positioned in FR3. In contrast
to D102R, the elimination of the atomic charge with D102A showed a
negligible ΔTm and binds with an
equal affinity to the antigen, as observed with the WT form. Figures 2 and 3 report that the WT residue of an Asp at 102 is placed in
the high-frequency selection for the conformers, and the D102A mutant
was predicted to be among the top-ranked substitutions, although still
susceptible to a loss in the thermal stability (Table 1). The substitution D102 → R was predicted
to be outside the top-ranked frequency, and the experimental data
reports a more significant decrease in the stability greater than
anticipated from its ranking among substitutions.

In contrast
to D102R, the limit of conserving function from sequence
tolerance is observed by the introduction of a proline in place of
a tyrosine (Y59P) in CDR2, producing a mutant where the binding was
eliminated, whereas the thermal stability remained near the WT form. Figure 2 shows that the placement
of a proline in the CDR2 is a rare occurrence in the sequence landscape
and is likely due to restraints in the backbone torsional flexibility.
The interplay of stability and function of the CDR2 is further established
by the P55S mutant where the KD is significantly
decreased and the loss in stability is negligible. Overall, the low
sequence consensus of prolines in the CDRs is predicted by the RosettaBackrub.

The mutant Y98A with an experimental measurement of −ΔTm ∼ 3 °C suggests the tolerance
profile for the B-chain to be more accurate in describing the configurational
stability than that of the A-chain, which is thought to be a kinetically
trapped chain in the dimeric form.8,27 A similar
observation can be made for mutants F29A, F29L, and K104G. Simulation
studies have been reported22 for comparing
the WT B-conformer with mutants F29A and Y98A and support the ranking
of residue substitutions given in Figure 2.

2.3 Assessment of Structure-Based
Stability Predictions
As an initial step in constructing
an empirical relationship between
the experimental Tm and a predictive model
at the molecular level, RosettaBackrub simulations were applied to
calculate the effects of residue substitutions on changes in the Rosetta
scoring28 of conformers (denoted by a free
energy change ΔG). Figure 5a reports the correlation of using both conformers
A and B as input structures to calculate conformational ensembles
for each mutation. Although it is important to note that the RosettaBackrub
calculations only model the folded conformations and do not reproduce
the thermodynamic co-existence between the folded and unfolded states
as in the experimental Tm, the correlation
is nevertheless of general interest to test whether simple models
can detect significant outliners in changes of the fold stability.
The computed Rosetta score is an average over the ensemble and is
relative to the WT form taken from the crystallographic assembly.
The calculated correlation coefficient of Figure 4a for evaluating 18 mutants using either
the A or B-conformer is only r = ∼0.2.

Figure 5 Scatter plots
of scoring the effect of 18 residue substitutions
relative to the wild-type structure and their relationship to the
experimentally determined changes in melting temperatures (ΔTm). To account for differences in physical units
between the computed ΔG and the experimental
ΔTm, the free energy coordinate
can be arbitrarily scaled by a “reference-state.” For
illustrations (a)–(c), conformations were generated by the
RosettaBackrub simulation method24 starting
with either the crystallographic A-chain conformer (denoted as green-colored
circles) or the B-chain conformer (blue triangles). The first two
plots were computed as statistical averages over each modeled conformational
ensemble. (a) Application of the Rosetta 3.1 scoring function to the
mutations, yielding linear regression correlation coefficients of r = 0.2 for both chains. (b) Scoring of the generated ensemble
by dDFIRE, yielding r = 0.1 for the A-chain and r = 0.5 for the B-chain. (c) The first-order rank conformer
determined by dDFIRE scoring for the two chains (r ∼ 0 for the A-chain and r = 0.3 for the
B-chain). (d) Application of the SDM modeling method15 using the starting crystallographic A-chain and B-chain
conformers to calculate changes in free energies and their relationship
to Tm (r ∼ 0 for
A-chain and r = 0.3 for the B-chain).

Given the poor performance of approximating the
observed experimental
changes, the conformational ensembles that were generated by the RosettaBackrub
for each mutation were rescored using the statistical potential dDFIRE.29 The selection of dDFIRE rather than other popular
statistical potentials (see, e.g., RWplus35 and GOAP36) is based on previous simulation
studies of A3 and protein structure refinement studies.22,30−34

The results shown in Figure 5b report a correlation of r = 0.1
for the
A conformer and 0.5 for the B-conformer. Although calculations for
the B-conformer yielded a slight improvement, there are several significant
outliers that unfavorably deter an accurate correlation (e.g., F29A,
D102R, and K104G). Rather than using the ensemble of conformations
in computing the relative differences, the top scoring conformations
determined by dDFIRE were only analyzed. Figure 5c shows the correlation r = ∼ 0 for the A conformer and r = 0.3 for
the B-conformer. For additional comparison purposes, the application
of the SDM server15 was applied to both
conformers. SDM is a two-state model calculation and uses a statistical
potential energy function that incorporates environment-specific amino
acid substitution frequencies within homologous protein families to
calculate a stability score. Figure 5d reports the SDM results and their relationship to
ΔTm. We find a correlation for the
A conformer of r = 0.1 and 0.4 for the B-conformer.

Modeled structures for several mutants and their reorganization
from the WT B-chain conformer predicted by RosettaBackrub simulations
are highlighted in Figure 6. The structure for F29A shows the distortion in the backbone
conformation from the WT form and disrupts the α-helix formation
for many of the ensemble. This modeling result combined with sequence–tolerance
profiles given in Figures 2 and 3 suggests that the helix is not
a determinant of the stability but rather a poor scoring by statistical
potentials of the generated conformations. Noticeable backbone displacements
are likewise observed for M111A, and to a lesser extent, D102R. Overall,
the examination of the predicted structures proves difficult to resolve
the differences between modeling and experiments.

wild-type sdAb conformation and selected mutants determined by RosettaBackrub
simulations. The structures are (a) wild-type B-chain conformer showing
CDR1 (colored cyan), CDR2 (green), CDR3 (yellow) and several mutational
sites; (b) mutant F29A; (c) D102R; and (d) M111A. For figures (b)–(d),
the wild-type conformation surrounding a selected sequence position
is shown in blue, the top-rank-ordered dDFIRE structure from the generated
ensemble is shown in green, and the lowest-rank ordered dDFIRE conformation
is shown in red. Surrounding local side-chains are highlighted in
the respective colors.

Figure 7 presents
predictions from additional servers as a part of the assessment of
modeling methods. The servers include mCSM,37 PoPMuSiC,18 and I-Mutant3.0.16 The mCSM strategy is a complementary approach
to SDM and specifically applies a novel graph-based signature approach
which extends the concept of the interatomic distance patterns to
a residue-environment description for the modeling of residue substitutions.
The PoPMuSiC predictor uses statistical potentials and is based on
a formalism that models a linear combination of energy functions,
where proportionality coefficients are fitted and vary with the solvent
accessibility of the mutated residue. The third web server is the
I-Mutant3.0, which is based on a support vector machine algorithm
and applies a statistical potential to score mutations.

A3. (a) mCSM server37 predictions showing r ∼ 0.5. (b) PoPMuSiC server18 with r ∼ 0.3. (c) I-Mutant3.0 server16 predictions showing r ∼

dDFIRE statistical potential and a weighted generalized Born (GB)
implicit solvent model applied to a two-state model of the folded
and unfolded conformations; the linear regression correlation coefficient
is r ∼ 0.8.

Although the results from the three servers show poor correlations
to experimentally measured values of ΔTm, the modeling strategies do detect one or two hot spots in
the sequence–tolerance landscape. The three top-ranked substitutions
from mCSM and PoPMuSiC are Y98A, M111A/V107I (or M111A), and F29A.
From I-Mutant3.0, the three are R70A, Y98A, and F29A. All three servers
failed to detect D102R and incorrectly modeled F29A as a false positive.

To help resolve why the charge-reversal D102R and several hydrophobic
substitutions are difficult to predict, a linear scaling approximation
was constructed as a model system to explore if a more accurate solvent
description can correct the difficulties of modeling changes in polarization
effects. The model system is assembled by the addition to dDFIRE a
linearly weighted generalized Born implicit solvent model (GBMV2).38 The GBMV2 model has been successfully applied
to modeling A3 for calculating thermal unfolding profiles of the wild-type
form and template-based homology models22 and the conformational transition of A → B upon unfolding.27

The linear scaling model is given by the
following net sum 1  where ΔΔGfold–unfolddDFIRE is the energy difference between a mutant
conformation and the wild-type
structure computed for both the folded (RosettaBackrub) and unfolded
(simulations) forms using the dDFIRE potential function. The term
ΔGfoldGB is the GBMV2 solvent free energy for the
folded conformation computed as the difference between the mutant
and WT form, and similarly, ΔGunfoldGB is for the
unfolded conformation. Unfolded conformations are modeled chains with
large measures of the radius of gyration and overall lack of secondary
structure.22,27 The terms εf and εu are scaling parameters determined from a
linear fit to the experimentally obtained ΔTm for each mutant.

Using only the B-chain conformer, Figure 7d reports the linear
scaling model with εf fitted to ∼20 and εu ∼ 10
for 18 mutants selected from the experimental data set. We find the
correlation coefficient to be r = ∼0.8, a
significant improvement from the routine application of simulations
of modeling only the folded state. We should note that merely including
the unfolded state scored by dDFIRE is not adequate to improve the
correlation, particularly that of D102R and K104G. Conversely, the
GBMV2 energies for charge deletions when properly weighted contribute
favorably to yielding a more accurate correlation. In general, the
importance of contributions from dDFIRE and GBMV2 depends on the change
in the solvent exposure at the substitution site of the native conformation
versus the unfolded form.

The reweighting of the solvent terms
in predictive models is not
a new idea and has been the subject of many investigations of continuum
models for computing solvent energies of protein structures.39−44 For the ideal model, εf = εu =
1, which describes a condition suitable for modeling substitutions
that do not alter the ionization or induce significant conformational
changes of the surface polarity. For the work presented here, the
high value of εf reflects structural changes not
adequately captured when conformations generated by the RosettaBackrub
simulations are introduced to the GBMV2 reaction field for mutations
that affect the dipolar reorganization. Likewise, εu accounts for the lack of an extensive conformational ensemble generated
for the mutants.

From the plot of Figure 7d, achieving good universality in the fitted
parameters appears
noticeably weak for several single-point mutants, particularly the
charge deletions R70A and K104G. These two ion-pair breaking mutants
are better modeled by allowing the scaling parameters to account for
local environment-specific effects along the protein chain as well
as amino acid type and substitution, namely, the form of εf → εf(xi, α → β), where xi is the spatial location of the residue i of type α to be mutated to type β. To test
this idea, we increased the contribution of ΔGfoldGB by setting
εf = 12. The net result improves −ΔTm predictions for R70A ∼ 10 °C and
K104G ∼ 8 °C, suggesting that the fitting accuracy of
mutants that alter ion-pairs should be treated differently in a structure-based
approach.

The last set of calculations is from the published
strategy developed
by Rooman and co-workers45 and is designated
as HoTMuSiC. This method applies statistical potentials and unlike the empirical relationship given above
of modeling the linear correspondence between the experimentally measured
ΔTm versus the predicted ΔΔG, the method HoTMuSiC allows a direct comparison between
ΔTm values from measurements and
predictions. Using the HoTMuSiC web server,45Figure 8 reports
a scatter plot of the experimental ΔTm versus predicted ΔTm and shows
an r = 0.4. Similar to the other predictions, HoTMuSiC
detects correctly hot spots at positions Y98 and M111, however showing
a false positive for F29A. Also, as observed with other web-based
predictions, the method fails to detect D102R and R70A as outliers.

3 Conclusions
The sequence tolerance
of the sdAb A3 with an unusually high thermal
stability was investigated by a combined computational and experimental
study. The experimental results demonstrated several hot spots in
the sequence fitness landscape of A3 and provided insights into why
this particular sequence mapped onto an sdAb scaffold is highly stable
in the folded conformation. Complementary to the experimental study,
the mutagenesis results provide a data set for evaluating different
computational strategies aimed at the structure-based design of single-domain
antibodies. Toward this end, an assessment of prediction methods was
provided in determining a relationship between calculations and experimental
changes in melting temperatures. The analysis showed that different
methods were able to detect outliers in fitness space; however, the
predictions generally suffered in accuracy when modeling a selective
set of electrostatic and hydrophobic mutations. To understand the
limitations in applying statistical potentials and knowledge-based
scoring functions in ranking mutations, a computational model was
tested of combining an all-atom statistical potential with a scaled
implicit solvent model to calculate the net contribution from the
two-state model of folded and unfolded conformations. The results
showed that integrating a weighted contribution of solvent molecular
electrostatics with a statistical potential function may offer improvements
in the rank order of sequence substitutions. As with any scaling function,
a poor universality in the fitted constants for different protein
systems may arise and require a readjustment for an optimal fit. Relative
to the computationally fast empirical methods, the proposed model
requires an increase in the computational demand due to the sampling
of conformational space (folded and unfolded) and the scoring of structures
with a physics-based implicit solvent model. For future protein designs
of sdAbs, a hybrid approach is likely the best strategy of applying
the scaling model as a refinement tool for modeling charge deletions
and/or substitutions that lack consensus among the available empirical
models.

4 Computational and Experimental Methods
4.1 Computational Approach
Starting conformations
for modeling were taken from the recently reported crystallographic
structure of the A3 sdAb determined to a resolution of 2.13 Å
(PDB 4TYU).8 The structure is a dimeric assembly of two distinctive
chains, one denoted as the A conformer and the other the B-conformer.
Because of the lack of a fully formed disulfide bond in the electron
density maps of each chain, the S–S bond was modeled. Other
modeled A3 conformations were taken from the crystallographic structures
PDB 4W70, 4TYU, 4U7S, 4W68, 4W81, and 4U05. Sequence tolerance
profiles for each conformer were generated by the RosettaBackrub simulation
method developed by Smith and Kortemme.23 The RosettaBackrub protocol consisted of Monte Carlo simulations
of a flexible backbone, and the side-chain moves in the Rosetta modeling
program. The simulations were followed by a combination of simulated
annealing and genetic algorithm optimization methods in the RosettaBackrub
to enrich for low-energy sequences.

For the application presented
here, we selected to model the sequence–fitness profiles for
regions F29–M34, P55–Y60, Y98–K104, D102–M111,
and N112–Y118, where amino acids were ranked individually for
each sequence position by a predicted frequency of tolerance.23 The regions were selected to model the sequence
and structurally variability of the CDRs. It should be noted that
the number of residues in a sampling window for computing a tolerance
profile is limited due to the computational task of modeling sequence
permutations. The generalized Rosetta modeling version26 was applied, and the number of generated conformations
was set to 20 for each residue position, the Boltzmann factor set
to 0.228, and the fitness score reweighting was given a value of 0.4.24 Sampling convergence from RosettaBackrub was
established by noting a little change from increasing the number of
generated conformations to 50 for a selected set of mutations. Simulation
parameters were set similar to that of computing the sequence–fitness
profiles. Two scoring functions were applied to the generated ensembles
and consisted of the Rosetta 3.1 energy function28 and the statistical potential dDFIRE.29

The set of 20 folded conformations generated from
the RosettaBackrub
(WT and mutants) plus the corresponding X-ray crystal structures were
subjected to the energy minimization by the method of steepest descent
minimization for 50 steps using the CHARMM22 + CMAP potential energy
function46 combined with the GBMV2 implicit
solvent model. For generating the unfolded states of the WT form,
parallel-tempering simulations were carried out by using the self-guided
Langevin dynamics (SGLD) simulation method to sample the conformational
space.47 A set of conformations were extracted
at the upper bound ensemble temperature of 475 K with the selection
criteria of satisfying large values of radius of gyration and having
minimum residual secondary structure content.22 An integration time step of 2 fs was used for all simulations. The
GBMV2 parameters for the simulations and all scoring were set to values
of β = −12 and P3 = 0.65 to smooth the
energy surface. The hydrophobic cavitation term was modeled by applying
the solvent-exposed surface area of the protein solute with a surface
tension coefficient set to a value of 0.015 kcal/(mol Å2).

SGLD parameters of the friction constant were set to γ
of
1 ps–1 for all heavy atoms, the guiding factor λ
set to a value of 1, and the averaging time tL was set to 1 ps. The selection of these values was taken
from previous studies of the SGLD model.22,27,32 Nonbonded interaction cutoff parameters
for electrostatics and van der Waals terms were set at a radius of
22 Å with a 2 Å potential switching function. Covalent bonds
between the heavy atoms and hydrogen atoms were constrained by the
SHAKE algorithm.48 Simulations were performed
using the Multiscale Modeling Tools for Structural Biology49 and the CHARMM simulation program50 (version c35b2). Simulations were carried out
using 32 replica clients, and the frequency of exchanges was set to
every 1 ps of simulation.

For generating the mutants in the
unfolded conformations, side-chains
of the WT unfolded conformations were replaced in the ensemble by
using the SCWRL modeling program51 and
were subjected to energy minimization using the same CHARMM22/GBMV2
force field. All ensembles were eventually scored with dDFIRE and
GBMV2 for final analysis.

4.2 Mutagenesis and Characterization
Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis for the construction of
18 mutants of
the A3 sdAb was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Agilent); mutations were confirmed by sequencing (Operon). Protein
was expressed and purified from the periplasm as a monomer using a
combination of osmotic shock, immobilized metal affinity chromatography,
and size exclusion chromatography, as described previously.2,4 The purified protein used for all experiments was in a monomeric
form. The protein concentration was determined based on the absorbance
at 280 nm using a nanodrop 1000 spectropolarimeter (ThermoFisher).
Samples were stored refrigerated in phosphate-buffered saline until
characterization.

The Tm of each
mutant was measured by CD using a Jasco J-815 CD Spectropolarimeter
equipped with a PTC-423S Peltier for temperature control, as previously
described.3,4 The CD measurements were done at least in
duplicate, often with several different preparations of the protein.
The Tm values estimated from replicate
measurements made by CD were all within less than a half degree of
each other.

Surface plasmon resonance utilizing a ProteOn XPR36
(Bio-Rad) was
employed to determine the binding of each mutant to surface-immobilized
SEB antigen.2,4 All SPR measurements were done
at least in duplicate, often with several different preparations of
each mutant as a monomer. The KD determined
by SPR for replicates agreed within at least a factor of 3. Other
than the mutants at P55, the KD values
were considered to be essentially equivalent to wild-type, as KD determinations can be problematic when off
rates are so slow.
