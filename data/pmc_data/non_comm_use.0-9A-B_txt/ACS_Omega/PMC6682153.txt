Recent studies have identified photodynamic
therapy (PDT) as a
promising approach for cancer treatment. Here, in this study, we have
constructed cancer cell membrane (CCM)-coated silica nanoparticles
(SIL) as an artificial cell carrier (CCM/SIL) to effectively deliver
chlorin e6 (Ce6), a commonly adopted photodynamic reagent (CCM/SIL/Ce6),
to achieve enhanced PDT of cancer. In addition, apart from the generally
recognized cytotoxicity induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS),
our study also revealed that ROS could further potentiate the loss
of intercellular junctions and integrity disruption as a result of
down-regulation of VE-cadherin and CD31. Consequently, dendritic cells
(DCs) were more readily accumulated to the tumor tissue and became
maturated, which secreted tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-12
(IL-12) to trigger the following immune responses. Our work not only
explored the anticancer feasibility of a new system but also demonstrated
the underlining mechanisms responsible for PDT-induced anticancer
effects, which offers a new perspective to employ and improve the
efficacy of PDT and related systems.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
is currently one of the most effective
approaches for cancer therapy.1 Compared
with common chemotherapy, PDT was generally recognized as a novel
way to employ toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells,
which has more advanced properties such as being noninvasive and precise.2 The transfer of oxygen into ROS relies on a photodynamic
agent, which is the core of PDT.3 Among
the currently applied photodynamic agents, chlorin e6 (Ce6) is widely
considered as the most preferable one, both in experimental and clinical
applications due to its irreplaceable advantages over its counterparts.
Nevertheless, Ce6 also has some inherent shortcomings, such as poor
solubility, high photoinstability, and water induced degradation,
which need the assistance of additional carriers.4,5

Although PDT has been widely adopted in many previous research
works, for a long time, ROS was considered to be fully responsible
for all therapeutic merits of PDT. However, with the advancement in
understanding of biochemical mechanisms in cancer therapy, the introduction
of PDT was reported to change the in situ structure of tumor tissue.6 Moreover, the significant apoptosis of cancer
cells and the mass release of cancer-related proteins and nucleic
acid are expected to induce potential immune responses. Therefore,
the efficacy of PDT might also involve the remodeling of tumor tissue
as well as immune responses, which deserves further investigations.7

The effective PDT usually requires the
aid of a well-designed drug
delivery system (DDS). In the past decades, the development of DDS
for cancer therapy has attracted the interest of scientists from all
over the world.8−10 The commonly adopted materials for construction of
DDS involves both organic and inorganic ones, such as conjugated polymers,11 naturally originated polymers,12 gold,13 calcium carbonate, and
so on. In particular, silica nanoparticles (SIL) as a kind of easily
accessible carrier is generally considered as a promising candidate
due to its multiple merits, including high biocompatibility, high
drug loading, high paintability, and low cost. As a result, many SIL-based
DDSs have been successfully developed and have made great progress
in the treatment of different kinds of cancers.14−16

Cancer
cell membrane (CCM) is the coating of cancer cells, which
plays important roles in many indispensable biological processes through
proteins inserted in the phospholipid bilayer.17 As a result, because of the inheritance of the full proteins
in the membrane, CCM was reported to effectively target the homologous
cancer cells via positive targeting.18 Moreover,
the CCM shows high biocompatibility with the capability to avoid potential
capture of the reticuloendothelial system (RES).19 Therefore, the CCM-coated carrier for targeted delivery
of anticancer agents is becoming the hot topic of current research.20 In particular, cell mimic carriers of high biocompatibility
are preferably welcomed.21

In our
work, SIL was coated with CCM to construct an artificial
cell-like DDS for effective delivery of Ce6 (CCM/SIL/Ce6). The CCM/SIL/Ce6
was expected to serve as a versatile DDS to exert and stimulate immune
responses for inhibition of cancer metastasis. First, the as-prepared
CCM/SIL/Ce6 was injected intravenously, followed by proper light irradiation.
The activated Ce6 could effectively transform the oxygen in the blood
vessels into toxic ROS, which could exert PDT to kill in situ cancer
cells. Afterwards, the disrupted tumor tissue was expected to increase
the accumulation of other constituents such as dendritic cells (DC).
The maturation of DC might be able to trigger the following immune
responses through the secretion of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin −12 (IL-12).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization
of CCM/SIL/Ce6
The preparation of CCM/SIL/Ce6 contains two
independent processes.
First, the SIL core was synthesized using microemulsion and then subjected
to drug loading of Ce6. At the same time, CCM from MCF-7 was also
isolated. Finally, the two components were integrated into one system
to prepare CCM/SIL/Ce6. As shown in Figure 1A, the as-prepared CCM/SIL/Ce6 was well-dispersed
nanoparticles with size narrowly distributed at around 100 nm. The
morphology observation presented in Figure 1B also confirmed this conclusion. In addition,
transmission electron microscope (TEM) results also found that CCM/SIL/Ce6
was spherical particles with a core–shell structure, with CCM
serving as the membrane while SIL acts as cytoplasm. As a result,
TEM provided preliminary evidence to prove the successful modification
of CCM on the surface of SIL. According to previous reports,22−24 nanoparticles with size under 200 nm can preferably take advantage
of the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect of tumor vasculature
to passively accumulate to the tumor tissue, which is beneficial for
targeted realization of PDT.

of SIL/Ce6
and CCM/SIL/Ce6 observed by TEM. Scale bar: 100 nm. (C) Comparative
expression of AT1R and CXCR4 in CCM/SIL/Ce6 and CCM.

In order to double confirm the successful construction
of cell-like
CCM/SIL/Ce6, two marker proteins (CXCR4 and AT1R) on CCM were selected
and their existence in both free CCM and CCM/SIL/Ce6 was compared.
As shown in Figure 1C, CCM/SIL/Ce6 showed comparable expression of CXCR4 and AT1R to
free CCM, indicating that the CCM was actually integrated in CCM/SIL/Ce6
with full membrane components, which was beneficial to inherit the
character of MCF-7 cells to bypass potential capture of RES and positively
target tumor cells.

The CCM/SIL/Ce6 was incubated in both phosphate-buffered
saline
(PBS) and plasma for 48 h and the variation in nanoparticle size was
employed to be a convenient parameter to indicate the stability of
CCM/SIL/Ce6. As shown in Figure 2A, CCM/SIL/Ce6 showed merely slight fluctuation on
size (less than 10%) during the whole period. Therefore, it was suggested
that CCM/SIL/Ce6 could maintain preferable stability under physiological
conditions, which is one favorable advantage for CCM/SIL/Ce6 to serve
as a DDS in various advanced applications.

plasma at 37 °C for up to 48 h. (B) Comparative fluorescence
stability of CCM/SIL/Ce6 and free Ce6. Data are shown as mean ±
S.D. (n = 3). **P < 0.01.

Apart from the size changes, the
stability of Ce6 within CCM/SIL/Ce6
was also tested using free Ce6 as control. As displayed in Figure 2B, free Ce6 rapidly
degraded under light irradiation for merely 1 day and persistently
decreased to only 18.87% at the end of the test, which was consistent
with the previous report that free Ce6 without protection is susceptible
to light irradiation.25 In contrast, CCM/SIL/Ce6
offered satisfied protection to the encapsulated Ce6. In detail, the
degradation of Ce6 in CCM/SIL/Ce6 was greatly retarded and only 13.21%
of the Ce6 was lost at 6 days post irradiation. According to the previous
report,26 free Ce6 is prone to absorb energy
from light and transfer it to the neighboring oxygen in the solvent,
which results in self-degradation and generation of singlet oxygen.
However, in CCM/SIL/Ce6, the Ce6 was safely encapsulated in the matrix
of SIL and kept away from the oxygen in the medium. The increased
ionic concentration at low pH might weaken the interaction between
Ce6 and SIL. Moreover, the increased solubility of Ce6 at lower pH
might also contribute to this result.27 As a result, the Ce6 within CCM/SIL/Ce6 was able to remain stable
in the circulation and exert its photodynamic function upon being
released in the tumor tissue.

Afterwards, hemolysis test was
conducted with the aim to further
explore the safety profile of CCM/SIL/Ce6. As illustrated in Figure 3A, after being incubated
with 2% RCB for 1 h, the hemolysis of all concentrations of CCM/SIL/Ce6
was lower than 2%. Although hemolysis was observed to positively relate
to CCM/SIL/Ce6 concentration, the hemolysis risk of CCM/SIL/Ce6 can
be ruled out because the practical in vivo nanoparticle concentration
is much lower than even the lowest concentration adopted in our test.

Figure 3 (A) Hemolysis
of 2% RCB incubated with various concentrations of
CCM/SIL/Ce6. (B) Protein adsorption of CCM/SIL/Ce6 against various
concentrations of BSA. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. (n = 3). **P < 0.01.

Furthermore, the protein absorption potential of CCM/SIL/Ce6
was
investigated with SIL/Ce6. It was well recognized by the previous
report that nanoparticles with positive surface charges are more likely
to interact with negatively charged proteins, which is the majority
component of plasma proteins, to form large aggregates. These aggregates
not only change the in vivo fate of nanoparticles but also hold the
risk to embolize blood vessels to cause death.28 As a result, the protein absorption potential as a critical
parameter of nanoparticles was worthy of investigation. In our study,
SIL/Ce6 with abundant free amine groups on the surface was employed
as a control and the variations in bovine serum albumin (BSA) absorption
as a function of BSA concentrations are summarized in Figure 3B. Consistent with previous
reports,12,28 positively charged SIL/Ce6 showed severe
absorption to BSA, which resulted in significant changes in OD278
with the increase of BSA concentrations. In contrast, CCM/SIL/Ce6
was inert to BSA with almost no variation in OD278.

Although
CCM/SIL/Ce6 could offer satisfactory protection to the
loaded Ce6, whether the encapsulated Ce6 can respond to laser irritation
to exert photodynamic effects remains to be explored. As a result,
1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a ROS detector was employed to
determine the ROS generation capability of CCM/SIL/Ce6. According
to a previous report,29 the decrease of
UV absorbance at 418 nm is negatively related to the ROS concentration
in the medium, which was an easy way to evaluate the ROS generation
capability of CCM/SIL/Ce6. As shown in Figure 4A, under laser irritation, the ROS generation
of CCM/SIL/Ce6 (Ce6: 0.1 mg/mL) increased as a function of time with
79% of quench at 6 min post irritation. Moreover, the results in Figure 4B also revealed that
ROS generation of CCM/SIL/Ce6 (1 W/cm2 for 60 s) was also
positively related to Ce6 concentration. Both results suggested that
the Ce6 in CCM/SIL/Ce6 preserved the capability to generate ROS.

CM/SLN/Ce6 (Ce6 concentration 0.1 mg/mL) after irradiation (1 W/cm2) for different time intervals. (B) Variation on absorbance
of DPBF in the presence of different concentrations of CM/SLN/Ce6
(Ce6 concentration: 0.1–0.5 mg/mL) under irradiation for 60
s. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. (n = 3).

The drug release behavior of CCM/SIL/Ce6
in two different pHs (7.4
and pH 5.5) was evaluated to explore the difference in physiological
environment and acidic tumor cells. As displayed in Figure 5A, CCM/SIL/Ce6 showed much
more slower drug release at pH 7.4 after 120 h of incubation (35.15%).
However, the accumulated release percentage at pH 5.5 could increase
to 79.74%. These results clearly demonstrated that CCM/SIL/Ce6 could
preferably release its payload in an acidic environment than in physiological
environments, which was beneficial for CCM/SIL/Ce6 to realize differential
drug release between the physiological environment and malignant tumors.

treated with different formulations. Scale bar: 20 μm. Data
are shown as mean ± S.D. (n = 3). **P < 0.01.

2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA)
as the cell permeable form of DCF, is nonfluorescent until oxidization
by ROS, which can exert greatly enhanced fluorescence. The intracellular
ROS generation profile of CCM/SIL/Ce6 was assessed by DCFH-DA. As
shown in Figure 5B,
cells without Ce6 showed no observable fluorescent signal after light
irradiation, suggesting that Ce6 was responsible for the generation
of ROS. As expected, a weak fluorescent signal was observed in cells
treated with free Ce6. Moreover, elevated ROS concentration was shown
in SIL/Ce6-treated cells, inferring that the intracellular Ce6 concentrations
in this group were higher than that in free Ce6. It was noted that
the fluorescent intensity in cells treated with CCM/SIL/Ce6 was much
more potent than other groups, indicating preferable ROS production.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images (Figure 5B, inset picture) also give
consistent results. Therefore, CCM/SIL/Ce6 with effective delivery
efficacy was suggested to be a preferable DDS for PDT of cancer.

2.2 Cellular Uptake and in Vivo Distribution
The accumulation of different formulations in MCF-7 cells were
studied. As shown in Figure 6A, the Ce6 signal in cells was positively related to incubation
time in all groups. It was also noted that compared to both nanoparticles,
free Ce6 showed the lowest intracellular accumulation. A previous
report has demonstrated that DDSs can exert beneficial effects to
increase the uptake of drugs into cells, which fully comply with our
observations.29 Moreover, without CCM pretreatment,
the CCM/SIL/Ce6 group always showed stronger Ce6 signals than SIL/Ce6
in all tested time intervals. Interestingly, the intracellular Ce6
intensity in CCM/SIL/Ce6 group suffered dramatic decline upon CCM
pretreatment, whereas both free Ce6 and SIL/Ce6 groups showed almost
no changes. These results suggested that the MCF-7 CCM modification
could increase the internalization of CCM/SIL/Ce6 to MCF-7 cells,
possibly via CCM-mediated endocytosis. According to a previous report,
the DDS not only increases the solubility of drugs but is also capable
of positively transporting it into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
As a result, free Ce6 showed much inferior uptake than the nanoparticles.30

CCM). (B) Mean fluorescence intensity of dissected tumors and major
organs of mice treated with SLN/Ce6 and CM/SLN/Ce6 at 48 h post injection.
Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 3). **P < 0.01.

In order to further verify the tumor-homing capability of
CM/SIL/ICG
to the isogenous MCF-7 cells, the fluorescence distribution of Ce6
in both tumor and major organs was obtained by ex vivo imaging. As
shown in Figure 6B,
because of its poor tumor targetability, the SIL/Ce6 was largely trapped
in many organs, especially RES (liver and spleen). In contrast, the
untargeted distribution was significantly alleviated in CM/SIL/ICG
as the Ce6 signal in tumor tissue was much higher than that in other
organs.

2.3 In Vitro Anticancer Effect
After
detailed characterization of CCM/SLI/Ce6, its in vitro anticancer
effect was investigated on MCF-7 cells using the methyl thiazolyl
tetrazolium (MTT) assay.31 First, a drug-free
carrier was incubated with cells to explore the biocompatibility.
As shown in Figure 7A, no evident decrease in cell viability after MCF-7 was incubated
with CCM/SLI at the concentration of 100 μg/mL for 48 h. These
results indicated that CCM/SLI was highly biocompatible, which was
suitable to be adopted as a drug carrier for drug delivery.

of CCM/SIL after 48 h incubation with MCF-7 cells.
(B) Cytotoxicity of free Ce6, SIL/Ce6, and CCM/SIL/Ce6 (with laser
irritation) at different Ce6 concentrations against MCF-7 cells after
48 h incubation. Inserted images demonstrate the cleaved Caspase-3,
Cytochrome c, and Bcl-2 levels in the three groups
(Ce6 concentration: 5 μg/mL). Data are shown as mean ±
S.D. (n = 3). **P < 0.01 vs CCM/SIL/Ce6.

Afterwards, the anticancer effect
of drug-loaded CCM/SLI/Ce6 was
assessed using free Ce6 and SIL/Ce6 as controls. Based on results
in Figure 7B, it was
inferred that the PDT effect was positively related to the given concentration
of Ce6. Moreover, unlike DDSs, free Ce6 showed much more inferior
anticancer effects, suggesting that DDS could exert beneficial effects
on drug delivery.32 Most importantly, compared
with SLI/Ce6, CCM/SLI/Ce6 showed much elevated benefits with cell
viability lower than 10% at the Ce6 concentration of 5 μg/mL,
which was the best among all tested formulations.

In order to
evaluate the in vitro anticancer effect from another
point of view, the Western blot assay was conducted to determine the
in vitro changes of three apoptosis-related proteins. Previous studies
have identified Bcl-2 as the suppressor of apoptosis, which exerts
beneficial effects on the survival of cells. Cytochrome c is another protein responsible for the initiation of apoptosis;
the upregulation of Cytochrome c usually indicates
a rise of apoptosis, which is usually accompanied with the activation
of following pathways.8 As a result, Caspase-3
was selected as the downstream protein to double verify the initiation
of apoptosis in cells.33 Results in Figure 7B demonstrated that
PDT of Ce6 resulted in decrease of intracellular Bcl-2 level. The
decrease in Bcl-2 was the reason for Cytochrome c elevation, which is further responsible for the increase of cleaved
Caspase-3. It was noted that CCM/SLI/Ce6 showed the lowest Bcl-2 level
as well as the highest Cytochrome c and Caspase-3
levels among three groups, indicating that CCM/SLI/Ce6-treated cells
were undergoing severer apoptosis as compared to other groups.

Multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) composed of fibroblast and
tumor cells represents the two basic components of solid tumors. As
a result, MCTS was widely adopted to mimic solid tumors for in vitro
studies. As shown in Figure 8A, the volume of MCTS without any treatment continuously increased
to grow to nearly 3-fold of its original size with evident boundary,
which was similar to the progression of solid tumors. After being
subjected to PDT, the volume of MCTS showed significant decrease as
compared to the saline group. Most importantly, consistent with the
MTT assay, CCM/SLI/Ce6 showed the best anticancer effect with the
smallest MCTS volume, which reversed the growth of MCTS to 072-fold
of its original size. This conclusion was also supported by the optical
images of MCTS shown in Figure 8B.

Figure 8 (A) Volume changes and (B) corresponding optical images of MCTS
after different treatments. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. (n = 3). **P < 0.01 vs CCM/SIL/Ce6.

2.4 In Vivo
Anticancer Study
The in vivo
anticancer study was also conducted using MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice
to confirm the above conclusions. The mice were randomly assigned
to different groups containing six subjects. Afterwards, the mice
were administered with different formulations with the same amount
of Ce6 (5 mg/kg) in parallel, using saline as the control. The administration
was repeated every two days and the changes in tumor volume and body
weight were recorded until the final administration. As shown in Figure 9A, PDT could exert
beneficial effects on the subjects as the tumor volume in all formulations
showed significant decrease in tumor growth. Among them, CCM/SIL/Ce6
showed the most potent efficacy (52 ± 9 mm3). Additionally,
the variation in body weight of the subjects are summarized in Figure 9B and reveal interesting
results. In consistency with results obtained in the MT assay, there
was no evident decline of body weight in the CCM/SIL/Ce6 group, confirming
its preferable biocompatibility. However, it was noted that mice in
the SIL/Ce6 group showed steady decrease in body weight as a function
of time. Considering the untargeted distribution of SIL/Ce6 in major
organs as well as its positive surface charge, it was inferred that
SIL/Ce6 might induced pathological changes on these organs through
disruption of membrane integrity. As a result, it was concluded that
the tumor homing and shielding property of CCM on the surface of CCM/SIL/Ce6
not only increase its anticancer efficacy but also reduce the undesired
side effects. Finally, HE assay was performed to verify the apoptosis
of tumor tissues (Figure 9C). Compared to the insignificant apoptosis in the saline
group, increased apoptosis was observed in all Ce6-containing groups
with the most serious one observed in the CCM/SIL/Ce6 group, which
was in line with results obtained in the above assays. In a word,
CCM/SIL/Ce6 holds great potential to be a preferable tumor-targeting
DDS for effective PDT of cancer.

expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 6). **P < 0.01 vs CCM/SIL/Ce6.

2.5 Tumor Disruption and Immune Responses
In order to illuminate the other underlying mechanisms responsible
for effective PDT, the integrality of tumor structure was investigated
by studying the expressions of ECs junction-related markers, VE-cadherin
and CD31, at different time intervals after PDT. As shown in Figure 10, tumors after
PDT treatment suffered from significant decline of both VE-cadherin
and CD31, which was also positively related to time. It is worth mentioning
that the CCM/SIL/Ce6 group showed the most potent downregulation of
both markers, suggesting that not only the tumor cells were killed,
but also tumor integrity was damaged after the CCM/SIL/Ce6 treatment.
The disrupted tumor tissue was expected to increase the transportation
of oxygen and other constituents such as DC, which led to following
immune responses.

tissues
at 24, 48, and 72 h after different treatments. Data are shown as
mean ± S.D. (n = 3).

Furthermore, two representative cytokines (TNF-α and
IL-12)
secreted by DC cells were selected and their concentrations in plasma
were determined using an ELISA kit. TNF-α is known to play important
anticancer roles, whereas IL-12 is critical for the activation of
CD8+ T lymphocytes and cytotoxic activity of natural killer
cells. As shown in Figure 11, at 24, 48, and 72 h after the different treatments, the
plasmic levels of both TNF-α and IL-12 gradually increased as
a function of time in PDT-treated groups, whereas insignificant changes
were observed in the control group. Most importantly, the CCM/SIL/Ce6
group showed the highest cytokine levels, indicating that CCM/SIL/Ce6
could significantly induce the immune response of the organism.

3 Conclusions
In our work, SIL was coated
with CCM to construct an artificial
cell-like DDS for effective delivery of Ce6 (CCM/SIL/Ce6). The CCM/SIL/Ce6
was demonstrated to be well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable
stability. In addition, CCM/SIL/Ce6 showed pH-responsive drug release
as well as efficient ROS generation capacity. The CCM modification
could positively guide CCM/SIL/Ce6 to target isogenous MCF-7 cells.
Both in vitro and in vivo anticancer assays demonstrated that CCM/SIL/Ce6
exerted superior PDT benefits than other counterparts, which might
be accompanied with tumor disruption and immune responses.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
DPBF,
MTT, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane
(AEAPS), DCFH-DA, tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS), Ce6, Triton X-100, and paraformaldehyde were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The otherwise stated
chemicals were all from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) in analytically
pure forms.

4.2 Preparation of Artificial
Cell Carrier
The preparation of the artificial cell carrier
was composed of two
steps. The SIL core was first synthesized according to a previous
report.34 In brief, a water-in-oil microemulsion
was prepared, to which TEOS, AEAPS, and NH4OH were successively
added to initiate the reaction. After being proceeded at room temperature
for 24 h, the product was collected by centrifugation (3000g, 10 min).

The isolation of CCM was conducted in
parallel using a previously reported protocol.20 In brief, MCF-7 cells were suspended in PBS and then homogenized
in proper amount of extracting buffer on ice. The obtained solution
was first centrifuged at 10 000g (4 °C)
for 10 min to remove large cellular debris. Afterwards, the obtained
supernatant was further centrifuged at 100 000g (4 °C) for 1 h to collect CCM. The obtained CCM was resuspended
in preserving buffer and stored at −80 °C until usage.
The protein concentration of purified PM was quantified using a BCA
kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

To finally construct the artificial cell carrier,
SIL was well
dispersed in PBS to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg/mL with
the assistance of sonication, the CCM (containing 50 μg of protein)
was then added dropwise into the solution under vortex. Afterwards,
the mixture was subjected to probe-type sonication (100 W, 5 min).
The mixture was further centrifuged (10 000g, 10 min) to obtain CCM/SIL.

4.3 Drug
Loading
The prepared SIL was
suspended in proper amount of ethanol under gentle agitation. Afterwards,
Ce6 in DMSO was dropwise added into SIL under agitation. After being
agitated at room temperature for 24 h, the mixture was subjected to
centrifugation (3000g, 10 min) to obtain the drug-loaded
SIL/Ce6. The SIL/Ce6 was then subjected to CCM modification to finally
obtain CCM/SIL/Ce6. In order to determine the drug-loading content
(DLC) of CCM/SIL/Ce6, nanoparticles were immersed in DMSO for 48 h
to fully extract the loaded Ce6. Afterwards, the solution was loaded
into a high-performance liquid chromatography system to determine
the DLC using the following conditions: A Thermo-Fisher UltiMate 3000
was loaded with LC-18-SUPELCO C18 column (250 mm ×
4.6 mm, 5 μm) and the mobile phase consisted of mixed methanol–ammonium
acetate aqueous buffer (0.05 M, pH was adjusted to 3.0 by acetic acid);
determined wavelength was 405 nm with flow rate at 1 mL/min under
30 °C.

4.4 Characterization
The size distribution
of CCM/SIL/Ce6 was measured by a size analyzer (ZS90, Malvern, UK).
The morphology was observed using TEM (Hitachi-1700, Hitachi, Japan).

The 2% red blood cells (RBC, from New Zealand rabbit, BioChannel,
Nanjing, China) were incubated with different concentrations of CCM/SIL/Ce6
at 37 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the RBCs were isolated using centrifugation
and the absorbance at 545 nm in the supernatant was determined by
using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV-1200, MAPADA, Shanghai,
China).35

The BSA adsorption assay
was conducted according to a previous
report.9 In brief, SIL/Ce6 and CCM/SIL/Ce6
were incubated with BSA aqueous solution (1 mg/mL) at the final ACC
concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mg/mL for 2 h at 37
°C. At the end of the incubation, samples were first centrifuged
at 20 000 rpm for 30 min and then filtrated through a Millipore
Syringe (0.22 μm). The variation of absorbance at 278 nm was
recorded and plotted against concentration. BSA aqueous solutions
subjected to the same procedures were employed as blank control.

The protein was extracted by the RIPA Lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher,
USA), followed by quantification by the BCA kit (Thermo Fisher). Different
samples with the same amount of proteins were loaded into the SDS-PAGE
gel and subjected to electrophoresis (90 V, 200 min). The isolated
proteins were transferred onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane
and stained with specific first antibodies at 4 °C overnight.
Finally, the IRDyeR680CW-labeled second antibody was applied and the
blots were observed by using a densitometer (ChemStudio touch, Analytik
Jena AG, Germany).

The TNF-α and IL-12 levels in the serum
supernatant were
assayed using an ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

4.5 Stability Assay
The size changes
of CCM/SIL/Ce6 in PBS and mouse plasma were monitored for 48 h to
test its colloidal stability. Moreover, the comparative fluorescence
quenching between CCM/SIL/Ce6 and free Ce6 was also determined by
using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F95, Aucy Instrument, Shanghai,
China) for 6 days.36

4.6 In Vitro Release and in Vitro ROS Generation
The drug
release from CCM/SIL/Ce6 was performed according to a
previous protocol.37 In brief, CCM/SIL/Ce6
in a dialysis bag was immersed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (v/v)
and placed in a thermostatic shaker (DHG-9053A; Marit, Wuxi, China).
The drug concentration at different time points was determined using
the protocols described above.

In order to test the ROS generation
capacity, 20 μL of DPBF (10 mM) was added to the CCM/SIL/Ce6
solution. The mixture was irradiated with laser (680 nm, 1 W/cm2), and the variations of absorption peak (418 nm) were recorded
by a UV spectrophotometer.29

4.7 In Vitro Anticancer Assay
Drug-free
nanoparticles (5–100 μg/mL) or CCM/SIL/Ce6 (Ce6 concentration,
0.25–5 μg/mL, 680 nm, 1 W/cm2 for 5 min) were
cultured with MCF-7 cells for 48 h and then subjected to a standard
MTT assay as previously reported.38

4.8 Intracellular Uptake and ROS Generation
MCF-7 cells
pretreated with or without CCM (2 h) were cultured
with free Ce6, SIL/Ce6, and CCM/SIL/Ce6. At different time intervals,
cells were harvested and subjected to flow cytometer (FCM, Attune
NxT, Thermo Fisher, USA) analyzation.

In order to evaluate the
intracellular ROS levels, cells were first incubated with different
formulations for 4 h, followed by incubation with DCFH-DA (25 mM)
in the dark for 30 min. Cells treated with or without laser irradiation
(1 W/cm2, 5 min) were observed by CLSM (VK-X, Keyence,
Japan).

4.9 In Vivo Distribution
The establishment
of the MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice model was conducted according to a
previous report.28 In brief, proper amount
of MCF-7 cells were suspended in PBS and planted into the flank of
female Balb/c mice (16–18 g). All procedures were approved
and strictly adhere to the guidelines of animal ethics committee of
the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University.

The MCF-7 tumor-bearing
mice were intravenously injected with SIL/Ce6 and CM/SIL/Ce6. At 48
h post administration, the mice were sacrificed and the Ce6 fluorescence
intensity in tumor tissues and other major organs was determined using
in vivo imaging system (FluorVivo, INDEC biosystems, USA).

4.10 In Vivo Anticancer Assay
The mice
were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 6) and administered
with saline (as control), free Ce6, SIL/Ce6, and CCM/SIL/Ce6 (5 mg/kg
Ce6). The irradiation wavelength was 680 nm at 1 W/cm2 for
5 min in all Ce6-containing groups. The administration and other protocols
follow the previous report.39
