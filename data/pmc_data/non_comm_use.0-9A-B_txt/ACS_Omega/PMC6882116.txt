Nanoporous photoelectrodes
with photoactive semiconductors have been investigated for various
energy applications such as solar cells and photoelectrochemical cells,
but the deposition of the semiconducting materials on the nanoporous
electrodes has been very challenging due to pore clogging or complete
pore filling. Here, we propose a band alignment model that explains
the morphology of the electrochemically deposited semiconductor layer
on the semiconducting nanoporous oxide electrode. Briefly, the coating
material with a conduction band edge higher (i.e., more negative)
than that of the electrode material forms a conformal coating, which
maintains the initial nanoporous structure. As a result, a conformal
CdSe layer can be electrodeposited onto TiO2 nanotubes,
which can be used as a photoelectrode of a sensitized solar cell.
The electron dynamics studies revealed that the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 nanotube electrode exhibited faster charge transport and
slower charge recombination than its dye-sensitized counterpart, which
has been ascribed to the passivation of surface traps and the physically
blocked back-electron transfer by the CdSe layer as well as the higher
conduction band of CdSe.

1 Introduction
Sensitized solar cells
(SSCs) with various sensitizers including molecular dyes,1,2 quantum dots,3−5 and thin inorganic layers6 have attracted much attention as potential candidates for next-generation
low-cost modestly efficient solar cell devices. Among the sensitizers,
the thin inorganic layers possess advantages of prominent light absorption
capability,7 tunable electronic properties,8 and direct deposition on the oxide electrodes
over other sensitizers.9 A typical thin
inorganic layer SSC consists of an electron-transporting phase, a
sensitizer, and a hole-transporting phase. The electron-transporting
phase is typically a nanoporous oxide semiconductor where the pores
are generally less than 100 nm for obtaining larger surface area.
The sensitizer covers the surface of the electron-transporting nanostructure.
The liquid or solid hole-transporting phase is infiltrated into the
pores of the sensitized electron-transporting electrode. Therefore,
it is critical to maintain the nanoporous structure after depositing
the sensitizer to obtain a typical SSC structure.

The electrochemical
deposition has been one of the most popular processes to fabricate
inorganic thin films10,11 and to fill the pores of electrically
insulating nanostructures like porous aluminum oxide films.12 However, it has been challenging to control
the morphology of deposited materials within nanoporous semiconducting
electrodes (e.g., TiO2 electron-transporting electrodes
of SSCs) owing to the small pore size and electrical conductivity
of the electrode materials. For instance, it has been shown that the
semiconductors usually do not fill the pores of the electrodes but
form an overlayer on top of the electrodes owing to the predominant
deposition at the entrance of the pores.13 One approach to overcome this clogging issue has been demonstrated
by filling the pores with the deposition electrolyte followed by the
electrochemical deposition in an inert electrolyte.13 We previously developed a general electrochemical bottom-up
growth approach by adjusting the ambipolar diffusion length (characteristic
reaction length) by controlling the ionic strength of the electrolyte
sovlent14 where the bottom-up growth of
p-type CuInSe2 (CIS) in ordered nanoporous n-type TiO2 electrodes was demonstrated. In the same study, we also showed
that CIS completely filled the entire TiO2 pore structure.
However, for the traditional SSC structure, a conformal coating of
the inorganic sensitizer is required to ensure the open pore structure.
A couple of papers15,16 reported the electrochemical
deposition of the conformal CdSe or CdTe layer on the surface of ZnO
nanowire arrays having average diameters/pores of hundred nanometers
where the pores are interconnected to each other. On the other hand,
there has been no report on the electrochemical deposition of conformal
semiconductor layers on the electrically conducting nanoporous network
with isolated pores less than 100 nm. Furthermore, no mechanistic
study has been reported regarding the factors determining the deposition
morphology between the complete pore filling and the conformal coating
within a nanoporous semiconductor network.

In this study, we
propose a band alignment model that determines whether a semiconductor
would fill the pores of the semiconducting oxide electrode completely
or it would form a conformal coating on the surface of the electrode
by electrochemical deposition. As a proof-of-concept example of this
model, we discuss the results of CdSe deposition on the TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays, and its growth behavior was compared with
that of the CIS/TiO2 NT counterpart. The interfacial charge
transfer between the host nanoporous electrode and the coating material
is found to be affected by the relative position of their conduction
band edge, which in turn determines the deposition morphology (i.e.,
conformal coating vs pore filling). For example, we found that the
conduction band offset between TiO2 and as-deposited CdSe
results in the conformal coating of CdSe on TiO2 NT arrays.
Also, the electron transport and recombination properties of the CdSe-sensitized
solar cell (CdSe-SSC) consisting of the conformal CdSe-coated TiO2 NT arrays were compared with those of its conventional dye-sensitized
counterpart (DSSC). At a fixed photoelectron density, the CdSe-SSC
with a cobalt-based electrolyte system exhibit 10 times faster transport
and 2 times slower recombination than the DSSC with the same electrolyte.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 TiO2 Nanotube
Preparation
Oriented TiO2 NT arrays were prepared
by electrochemically anodizing Ti foil (Alfa, 0.25 mm, 99.5% purity)
in a two-electrode cell with a Pt counter electrode. The anodization
electrolyte consisted of 0.15 M ammonium fluoride (Aldrich, 99.9%)
and 3.5 wt % water in formamide (Aldrich, 99.9%). The Ti foils were
biased at 20 V for 2 h at room temperature, resulting in 2 μm
thick amorphous NT arrays. As-prepared NT films were rinsed with water
and ethanol followed by the subsequent thermal crystallization at
400 °C in air for 1 h.

2.2 CdSe Deposition
The electrochemical deposition was carried out using a computer-controlled
potentiostat (EG&G, PAR283) with a three-electrode cell with a
Pt mesh counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode
(calibrated against [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–). The CdSe was deposited on the TiO2 NT electrode by
a potential pulse method (−0.85 V vs Ag/AgCl for 0.5 s and
open circuit for 2.5 s) with a deposition solution composed of 20
mM CdCl2 (Aldrich, 99.99%) and 4 mM H2SeO3 (Aldrich, 99.999%) in absolute ethanol (Pharmco-Aaper, 200
prf). After deposition, CdSe was crystallized by annealing at 400
°C for 1 h (ramp rate of 5 K·min–1) under
a N2 atmosphere.

2.3 Thin Absorber Solar Cell
CdSe-coated TiO2 NT films were assembled into sensitized
solar cells according to the procedure described in our previous paper.17 Briefly, the device was assembled in a sandwich
configuration with the nanotube film facing a counter electrode, prepared
by spreading a droplet of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in 2-isopropanol
onto the commercial F:SnO2 (FTO, TEC15) conducting glass
substrate and subsequently firing it at 350 °C. In order to prepare
the electrolyte solution, 0.2 M [Co(phen)3](ClO4)2 (tris[1,10-phenanthroline]cobalt(II) perchlorate),
0.02 M Co3+ complex ([Co(dtb-bpy)3](ClO4)3, tris[4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine]cobalt(III)
perchlorate),18 and 0.2 M LiClO4 were dissolved in the mixture solvent composed of acetonitrile and
ethylene carbonate (4:6 in volume ratio). The Co3+ complex
was used instead of the chemical oxidizing agents like NOBF4 (nitrosodium tetrafluoroborate) to prevent the possible production
of nitric oxide (NO) species.19 The active
area after cell assembly was 0.5 cm2.

2.4 Characterization
The crystalline structure and microstructure
of the CdSe-coated TiO2 NT films were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM). Transport and recombination properties were measured by
intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and intensity-modulated
photovoltage spectroscopy as described previously.20 For these measurements, the solar cells were probed with
a modulated beam of 680 nm light superimposed on a relatively large
background (bias) illumination, also at 680 nm. The probe and bias
light entered the cell from the counter electrode side.

3 Results and Discussion
As described in the Introduction, our previous study revealed that the
CIS completely fills the pores of TiO2 NT arrays during
the electrochemical deposition.14 As a
result, the sample forms a very nice p–n bulk heterojunction
structure (Figure 1a). However, the conduction band edge position of CIS (+0.2 eV vs
NHE)21 is lower than that of TiO2 (−0.5 eV vs NHE),22 hindering
efficient injection of photoelectrons from CIS to TiO2,
which is not ideal for a p–n bulk heterojunction solar cell.
So, we selected CdSe as an alternative to CIS because its conduction
band edge position (−0.8 eV vs NHE)23 is known to be higher than that of TiO2, and thus, the
photoelectrons can be easily injected to TiO2.24 One could expect a similar p–n bulk heterojunction
structure with CdSe if the same electrochemical deposition technique
were used. However, as shown in Figure 1b, the morphology of CdSe after the electrochemical
deposition was totally different from that of CIS. CdSe forms a conformal
coating on the nanoporous TiO2 NT arrays, resulting in
a porous structure that is suitable for a conventional three-phase
sensitized solar cell. Comparing the NT morphology before and after
the deposition (i.e., upper left image in Figure 1a and lower left image in Figure 1b, NT walls get thicker after
CdSe deposition, but pores are still open throughout the NT. The analysis
of SEM images with higher magnifications (not shown) revealed that
the thickness of the NT walls increases from 10–15 to 20–25
nm, whereas the inner diameter of the NT pores decreases from 60–70
to 50–60 nm. This result indicates that the conformal CdSe
layer with a thickness of ∼5 nm covers both inner and outer
surfaces of the NTs. So, what mechanism during the electrochemical
deposition allows CdSe to form a conformal layer as opposed to the
complete pore filling by CIS? Given the reason why we chose CdSe as
opposed to CIS (i.e., conduction and edge positions), we hypothesized
that the band alignment between the host n-type electrode and guest
p-type semiconductor materials would affect the behavior of the electrochemical
deposition.

Figure 1 (a) SEM images of CIS-deposited TiO2 NT arrays, showing
a complete bottom-to-up pore filling behavior (upper left: before
deposition; lower left: during the deposition (2.9 h); right: overlayer
formation after a 3.8 h deposition at −0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl).
Note that panel (a) was adopted from our previous publication.14 (b) SEM images of CdSe-coated TiO2 NT arrays where CdSe was coated conformally on the surface of TiO2 NTs after 43200 pulse cycles (i.e., 6 h of deposition at
−0.85 V vs Ag/AgCl).

Figure 2 shows a schematic
illustration of the effects of the in situ band alignment between
the electrode and as-deposited coating materials on the final deposition
morphology. During the cathodic electrochemical deposition using a
negative bias potential, the electrons needed for the deposition (i.e.,
the reduction of the reactants) should be supplied from the conducting
substrate to the electrode/electrolyte interface. It is noteworthy
that all the deposition mechanisms in this study were discussed assuming
that the solvent with a low ionic strength like the absolute ethanol
was used for the deposition. With such a solvent, the ambipolar diffusion
length of the electrons in the nanoporous TiO2 electrode
filled with the electrolyte is sufficiently short, resulting in the
bottom-up growth.14 In the case where the
conduction band edge of the coating material is lower (i.e., more
positive) than that of the electrode material (Figure 2a), the electron transfer from the electrode
to the coating layer is facilitated due to the appropriate band alignment.
Therefore, the deposition takes place at both the coating material/electrolyte
interface (routes 1 and 2 in panel (a)) and the nearby electrode/electrolyte
interface (route 3 in panel (a)), resulting in the complete filling
of the pores with the coating material. On the other hand, if the
conduction band position of the coating material is higher (i.e.,
more negative) than that of the electrode material, the electron transfer
from the electrode to the coating layer is obstructed by the inappropriate
band alignment. In this case, deposition will stop once the electrode
surface is covered by the coating layer with a certain thickness (routes
2 and 3 in panel (a)), causing electrons to migrate further through
the electrode to find a suitable reaction site (i.e., the electrode/electrolyte
interface; route 1 in panel (a)). Consequently, the coating layer
will grow conformally on the electrode surface from bottom to top.
This model can also explain the conformal coating of CdSe on the nanoporous
ZnO film reported by other groups.15,25 Indeed, ZnO
and TiO2 are known to have very similar conduction band
levels, as well as valence band positions and band gap values,26 which results in similar band alignments with
CdSe.

and (b) conformal coating.

Figure 3a shows the
XRD patterns of a CdSe-coated TiO2 NT film before and after
annealing at 400 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The as-deposited
CdSe is amorphous, as no peak other than crystalline anatase peaks
(denoted as A) from the TiO2 NTs and Ti metal peaks (denoted
as *) can be observed. The XRD pattern of the TiO2 NT electrode
(i.e., the as-deposited sample) is consistent with previous reports
on anodized TiO2 NT systems.27,28 After annealing,
the as-deposited amorphous CdSe layer was crystallized to the hexagonal
wurtzite structure with characteristic three peaks between 23 and
28° (with a CuKα radiation) denoted as C. Because the as-deposited
CdSe layer is amorphous, the in situ band alignment between CdSe and
TiO2 that was assumed based on the conduction band position
of crystalline CdSe has to be confirmed. Figure 3b compares the photoresponse of the TiO2 NT electrodes in the presence and in the absence of the as-deposited
CdSe, from which one can determine the in situ band alignment between
CdSe and TiO2 during the deposition. A three-electrode
electrochemical setup similar to the electrochemical deposition was
used with an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte (0.1 M Na2S, 0.1 M S, and 0.1 M NaOH). A blue-light-emitting diode with a characteristic
wavelength of 470 (±10) nm (i.e., 2.64 eV) and an optical power
of 5 mW was used as a visible-light source. Given the estimated band
gap energy of each material (i.e., 1.72 eV for CdSe and 3.2 eV for
TiO2), it was assumed that most incident photons would
be absorbed by CdSe. For better comparison, the lowest current during
the pulse illumination was set to zero. It is evident from the difference
between the two current density profiles that the as-deposited CdSe
is photoactive and the excited photoelectrons are being injected to
the TiO2 conduction band as illustrated in the inset of Figure 3b. If the conduction
band edge of the as-deposited CdSe were lower than that of TiO2, no photocurrent should have been observed from this measurement.
The direction of the photocurrent (i.e., anodic photocurrent), which
was confirmed by comparing to that of a normal dye-sensitized solar
cell, also supports the band alignment assumption between as-deposited
CdSe and TiO2.

TiO2 NT arrays before and after annealing at 400 °C
for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere where C, A, and the asterisk
(*) indicate peaks of CdSe (wurtzite, JPCDS #77-2307), TiO2 (anatase, JPCDS #21-1272), and Ti metal substrate (JPCDS #44-1294),
respectively. (b) Photocurrent density profiles of TiO2 NT electrodes with and without the as-deposited CdSe layer under
pulse illumination by 470 nm light where the inset shows an illustration
of the band alignment and the resulting charge injection between the
as-deposited CdSe layer and the TiO2 NT.

Figure 4 shows
the transport (τc) and recombination (τr) time constants for a CdSe-sensitized TiO2 NT
solar cell (CdSe-SSC) and a dye-sensitized counterpart (DSSC), both
of which use a cobalt-based electrolyte system. Both τc and τr exhibit the usual power-law dependency on
photoelectron density and Voc, respectively.
The power-law dependency of τc can be explained by
a model in which electrons perform an exclusive random walk between
trap sites that have a power-law distribution of waiting (release)
times in the form of t–1−α, where parameter α is in the range from 0 to 1 and can be
related to the shape of the trap distribution.29,30 From the best fits of the τc data in Figure 4 to the expression τc (∝Dn–1) ∝ n1–1/α,31 the respective α values for the CdSe-SSC
and the DSSC were determined to be 0.29 and 0.27, respectively. Similar
α values are understandable, as the two solar cells consist
of the same electron-transporting phase (i.e., the TiO2 NT arrays). At a given photoelectron density or Voc (i.e., the same quasi-Fermi level), the CdSe-SSC exhibits
10 times faster transport and 2 times slower recombination than the
DSSC, which should lead to a much higher charge-collection efficiency
(ηcc). The slower recombination of the CdSe-SSC than
the DSSC can be attributed to the existence of the CdSe conformal
layer, which can physically/energetically prevent the electron recombination
from TiO2 to the oxidized electrolyte species. The faster
electron transport in the CdSe-SSC is also likely associated with
the changes of the surface properties. Passivation of surface traps
by the conformal CdSe layer could lead to faster electron transport,
owing to the reduced number of traps that the electrons visit and
thus the reduced time that the electrons spend before they are collected
by the Ti foil.32 In addition, the conduction
band offset at the CdSe/TiO2 interface could confine the
injected electrons in the region relatively far from the TiO2 surface, which should similarly result in faster transport.

show the best fit of the data.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a band alignment
model that determines the morphology of the electrochemically deposited
semiconductor layer on the semiconducting nanoporous oxide electrode.
The electron microscopy combined with a photoelectrochemical measurement
revealed that the semiconductor forms conformal coating on the electrode
surface when its conduction band is higher than that of the electrode
(e.g., CdSe/TiO2 system). On the other hand, the semiconductor
fills the pores of the electrode completely in the case of the opposite
band offset. The amorphous as-deposited CdSe conformal layer crystallized
to the hexagonal wurtzite phase after annealing at 400 °C for
1 h under a N2 atmosphere. The CdSe-sensitized TiO2 NT electrode exhibited faster charge transport and slower
charge recombination than the dye-sensitized counterpart. The band
alignment model proposed in the study provides a convenient avenue
of determining materials combination for the morphology control during
the electrochemical deposition.
