A highly
sensitive catecholamine (CA) sensor was created using
a biointerface layer composed of a biopolymer and a potentiometric
detection device. For the detection of CAs, 3-aminophenylboronic acid
(3-NH2-PBA) was reacted with the carboxyl side chain of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa, LD) and the PBA-modified l-dopa was directly copolymerized with LD on an Au electrode,
resulting in a 3.5 nm thick PBA-modified poly(PBA–LD/LD) layer-coated
Au electrode. By connecting the PBA–LD-coated Au electrode
to a field-effect transistor (FET), the molecular charge changes at
the biointerface of the Au electrode, which was caused by di-ester
binding of the PBA–CA complex, were transduced into gate surface
potential changes. Effective CAs included LD, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine
(NE), and epinephrine (EP). The surface potential of the PBA–LD-coated
Au changed after the addition of 40 nM of each CA solution; notably,
the PBA–LD-coated Au showed a higher sensitivity to LD because
the surface potential change could already be observed after 1 nM
of LD was added. The fundamental parameter analyses of the PBA–LD
to CA affinity from the surface potential shift against each CA concentration
indicated the highest affinity to LD (binding constant (Ks): 1.68 × 106 M–1,
maximum surface potential shift (Vmax):
182 mV). Moreover, the limit of detection for each CA was 3.5 nM in
LD, 12.0 nM in DA, 7.5 nM in NE, and 12.6 nM in EP. From these results,
it is concluded that the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET could
become a useful biosensor for neurotransmitters, hormones, and early
detection of Parkinson’s disease.

==== Body
Introduction
Catecholamines (CAs)
play an important role in functional regulation
of the body by acting as hormones and neurotransmitters. Among the
CAs, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EP) act
as adrenal medullary hormones and are responsible for sympathetic
nerve action. Thus, it has been reported that the concentration of
these three CAs in the blood increases in response to tension and
stress.1 Furthermore, CAs have been measured
as adrenal tumor biomarkers because it was reported that the total
blood CA concentration is about 10 times higher in the case of adrenal
medullary pheochromocytoma development than a few nM value normally
found in the blood.2,3 Additionally, l-dopa
(LD), which is the starting material for all CA metabolism and derived
from tyrosine, is used in anti-Parkinson’s disease medication
because it can cross the blood–brain barrier.4,5 Because CA is successively metabolized in short order by enzymes
from LD to EP, it is necessary to detect the total CA levels in body
fluids.6 However, CAs have been measured
mainly by fractionation and quantification using high-performance
liquid chromatography, an easy-to-use and direct detection method
for CA level measurements that is expected to become accessible for
point-of-care testing.7,8

CAs have another unique
characteristic. They can undergo oxidative
self-polymerization to form polycatecholamines,9 which are biomimetic materials that are similar to the
adhesive substance secreted from mussels.10 From the first report of polycatecholamine, its application has
been studied because it could adhere to a wide variety of materials
including polymers and metals.9,11−14 We focused on the chemical, adhesive, and easy-to-synthesize properties
of polycatecholamine and applied them to create an electrode interface
for biosensing.

The field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor
is based on the principle
of detecting charges of biomolecules at the gate electrode interface
and has been developed to obtain information from ionic substances
in a nonlabeling, rapid, and quantitative method.15−17 Thus, FETs
have been successful in measuring the charge changes of ions, DNA,
saccharides, proteins, and living cells adjacent to the gate surface
in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner.18−22 An extended-gate FET, which contains a sensing gate
electrode separated from the detection portion, is a useful tool for
the construction of FET biosensors because we can design the material
and shape of the gate electrode freely so as to match the interfacial
modifications with the properties of the targeted molecules.23 Various saccharides have been reportedly quantified
from as few as tens of μM using an extended-gate FET whose Au
gate electrode was modified with a phenylboronic acid self-assembled
monolayer (PBA-SAM).24 The boron atom in
the PBA molecule changes from a neutral to a negative state when bound
to vicinal diol compounds, such as sugars, through an equilibrium
reaction so that the PBA-SAM-coated gate FET can capture the charge
on the boron atom generated at the gold electrode interface in response
to changes in sugar concentration. In the present study, as shown
in Scheme 1, we constructed
a thin layer of PBA-containing poly(l-dopa) on a gold electrode
utilizing the unique characteristics of l-dopa, which polymerizes
through a self-oxidization process and strongly adheres to metals.
By efficiently capturing the charge events at the interface of an
FET (Scheme 1A), we
aimed to selectively detect CAs that possess diol structures based
on the PBA equilibrium mechanism (Scheme 1B).

Results and Discussion
Organic Synthesis of the PBA–LD Monomer
and Electropolymerized
Formation of Poly(PBA–LD/LD) on an Au Surface
To introduce
a PBA molecule onto LD as a monomer, an amide formation reaction between
the amino group of NH2-PBA and the carboxyl group of the
LD side chain was utilized in the presence of the dehydration reagent
4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride
(DMT-MM) (Scheme 2).
The synthesized product was identified by 1H NMR, as shown
in Figure 1. The 1H NMR indicated that the resulting product is the mixture
of the designed product PBA–LD and reagent NH2-PBA.
The hydrogen peaks in PBA–LD (Figure 1b,c) appeared after 15 min reaction and gradually
increased over 4 h, whereas the hydrogen peaks in NH2-PBA
(Figure 1a) decreased.
The conversion efficiency was calculated from the peak area ratio
of the NH2-PBA hydrogen (Figure 1a) and the PBA–LD hydrogen (Figure 1b,c). The ratio of
unreacted NH2-PBA and synthesized PBA–LD in the
solution was 3:2, indicating a product yield of 40%. Thus, the PBA
was successfully introduced to the LD monomer. Because the pKa value of 3-amino PBA is higher than that of
other PBA derivatives in the bulk aqueous solution (pKa: 8.9), we consider that the PBA–LD complex by
di-ester binding has not been formed during the synthesis process
at neutral pH.25 Due to the difficulty
in the purification of PBA–LD, the reaction mixture was directly
used for the oxidative copolymerization of PBA–LD and LD to
form the polymer coating. The oxidation of CA is proposed to be a
multistep process requiring an external source of electrons. Thus,
the formation of poly(PBA–LD/LD) was monitored through the
current changes of the Au electrode. Figure 2 shows the time course of current changes
in the LD and PBA–LD/LD-containing solutions at a constant
positive potential. A negative current flowed to the Au electrode
because Au accepted electrons from the solutions. Furthermore, the
current increase almost stopped after 1500 s, suggesting that the
Au electrode was sufficiently covered with an insulating polymer film.
From these results, it was suggested that poly(LD) and poly(PBA–LD/LD)
layers had accumulated on the Au surface. After the electropolymerization
of poly(LD) and poly(PBA–LD/LD), the thickness of the polymer
layers was evaluated by ellipsometric analysis (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The thickness of poly(LD)
was 13.9 ± 0.1 nm, whereas that of poly(PBA–LD/LD) was
3.5 ± 0.1 nm. It is well known that poly(LD) accumulates and
strongly adheres to the metal surfaces, such as Au, in nanometer thickness
and that the polymer chains orient to form multilayers through π–π
stacking and electrostatic interactions.26,27 The lamination mechanism was proposed to start with a few nanometer-thick
polycatecholamine layers accumulating by π–π stacking
as a fundamental nanoaggregate, followed by secondary nanoaggregation
to 10–20 nm thick substructures through π–π
stacking of the edge-to-edge nanoaggregates.28,29 From this information, it was supposed that the poly(PBA–LD/LD)
layer formed the fundamental nanoaggregates, whereas the poly(LD)
layer was grown as the secondary aggregate. In the case of poly(PBA–LD/LD),
the PBA side chain in the nanoaggregates of poly(PBA–LD/LD)
inhibited the edge-to-edge π–π stacking of poly(LD)
and suppressed the thicker layer growth of the secondary aggregate
substructure. The wettability of each surface also supported the successful
fabrication of a PBA-containing poly(LD) layer. Figure 3 shows the water static contact angles of
Au, poly(LD)-coated Au, and poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated Au. Lamination
with poly(LD) produced a more hydrophilic Au surface, consistent with
previous reports.12 The contact angle of
the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated Au was slightly larger than that
of poly(LD), possibly because the surface of poly(PBA–LD/LD)
contained hydrophobic benzene rings from the PBA unit. Note that a
hydrophilic carboxyl group is present at the corresponding position
of LD.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Pathway of Poly(PBA–LD/LD)
Detection of CA Using the Poly(PBA–LD/LD)-Coated
Gate
FET on an Au Surface
To investigate the electrochemical CA
sensor, we assembled a poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated extended-gate
FET by connecting the nanolayered poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated Au
electrode with a MOSFET. First, the interfacial property change by
introducing the PBA unit to the poly(LD) layer was examined using
a semiconductor parameter analyzer. Changes in the drain current (ID) were measured at the time of applying the
gate voltage, from −2 to +3 V, and the threshold of the gate
voltage shift (ΔVT) at 4 mA of ID was plotted against changes in pH (from 5
to 11) with the addition of 10 μM catechol addition in 100 mM
sodium phosphate buffer. Figure 4 shows the ΔVT plots
of the poly(LD)- and poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FETs from
the obtained ID–VG curve (Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information). In the catechol-free case (Figure 4A), both FETs obviously showed a linear pH
response. This was caused by the functional side chains in LD, such
as the carboxyl and amino groups, equilibrating with protons.30 The ΔVT shift
was almost the same in both the poly(LD)- and poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FETs (ca. 45 mV/pH for poly(LD) and 42 mV/pH for poly(PBA–LD/LD)).
On the contrary, the ΔVT shift in
the poly(LD)-coated gate FET decreased to 33 mV/pH, and the plots
in the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET changed to a sigmoidal
curve when 10 μM of catechol was added (Figure 4B). Considering the decreasing pH sensitivity
of poly(LD)-coated gate FET from 44.8 mV/pH in the buffer without
catechol to 33.1 mV/pH in that with catechol, catechol most likely
attached to the poly(LD) surface through π–π stacking
and hydrogen bonding. Thus, the attached catechol shielded the functional
groups of poly(LD), preventing the participation of the proton equilibrium.
Thus, curve fitting of the plots of the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET in the presence of 10 μM catechol was changed from
the linear to sigmoidal. The ΔVT shift was sharp near the neutral pH region and weakened as the pH
exceeded 9, resulting in an upward fitting curve. This result indicated
that the PBA equilibrium with catechol affected the change in the
ΔVT shift. The decrease in ΔVT at a higher pH was possibly caused by the
negatively charged boron atom forming a complex with PBA and catechol.
This might prove the existence of PBA units on the surface of poly(PBA–LD/LD)
layer, and the pKa of PBA at the interface
could be calculated to be 7.18 by fitting the sigmoidal curve (eq 1).31 1  where ΔVTmin and ΔVTmax are approximated values of the minimum and maximum threshold
gate voltage, respectively, pKa is the
acid dissociation constant of the poly(PBA–LD/LD) layer, and n is the Hill coefficient (slope at the pKa point). PBA maintains an equilibrium between four states
in the presence of diol compounds, as shown in Scheme 1B. The acidic dissociation constant (pKa-acid) of PBA is reported to be 8.6–8.8,
in which the boron atom orbital changes from sp2 to sp3 with increasing negative charge (state 2 in Scheme 1B). In this experiment, we
calculated the pKa of PBA in the tetrahedral
binding state with catechol (state 3 in Scheme 1B). Actually, the pKa of the PBA situated at the interface between the electrode
and solution was approximately 7, indicating that the surface potential
changes derived from PBA equilibrium with catechol could be monitored
at the physiological pH.

gate FET at 4 mA
of ID from the ID–VG curve as the pH changes
from 5 to 11 in 100 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (A) without and
(B) with 10 μM catechol. Linear fitted lines were obtained for
poly(LD); sigmoidal curve was obtained for the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET with 10 μM of CA in each pH solution, as indicated
with red dots.

From the kinetic analysis
of the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET interface, each type of CA detection was examined by changes
in the surface potential (Vout) of the
FET using a real-time source–follower monitoring system. Each
CA was gradually added, from 1 nM to 20 μM, final concentration
in PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) onto the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated Au,
and the Vout changes were monitored as
shown in Figure 5.
The Vout decreased in the negative direction
whenever CA was added, indicating that the negatively charged PBA
units were formed by the binding with CAs and recognized by the FET.
On the other hand, the Vout of the poly(LD)-coated
gate FET hardly responded to the CAs inputs, except for the higher
LD concentration case (Figure S3, the Supporting
Information). The interaction between PBA and CAs was also confirmed
by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
spectroscopic analysis of poly(LD)- and poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
Au electrodes. The peaks of C–O stretching at 1256 cm–1, N–H stretching at 1309 cm–1, and C=O
stretching at 1739 cm–1 increased and shifted, and
specific peaks derived from di-ester binding of boronic acid and free
CAs appeared after addition of CAs in poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
Au, compared with those in poly(LD)-coated Au (Figure S4, the Supporting Information). Considering the relationship
between the gate potential shift in the FET and the number of PBA
units reacting with CAs, the Vout of the
poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET shifted 80–180 mV with
every 10 μM addition of each type of CA. The capacitance model
at the device interface can be described using eq 2 2  where ΔQPBA-CA is the charge change from the equilibrium of
PBA and CA and Ctotal is the combined
capacitance of the entire
circuit. Figure 6 shows
a circuit diagram of the combined capacitance model. Ctotal may be the capacitance model in series from the
capacitance of the MOSFET device itself and the electric double-layer
capacitance at the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate electrode interface.
However, Ctotal is assumed to dominate
the MOSFET value because the MOSFET capacitance (CFET = 30 pF) was quite small compared to the electric
double-layer capacitance at the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate
electrode interface (CEDL = ∼1
μF). Thus, there was a significant change of 3.0 × 10–12 C when the Vout of the
poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET shifted 100 mV. Thus, the amount
of diol binding to PBA was estimated to be 2.4 × 107 molecules cm–2. It is known that the range of
the electric double layer decreases as the salt concentration increases
presented by the Debye length. In the present study, poly (PBA–LD/LD)
thin film exceeds the theoretical Debye length from the Au surface.
However, because the charge change in the boronic acid molecule is
obviously captured by the MOSFET, we have to reconsider the position
of the diffusion layer in case of thin layer-coated Au surface, referring
to the site-binding model at the oxide membrane.

addition (orange line), and EP addition (green line).

double-layer capacitance at poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate electrode
interface and the MOSFET capacitance.

Additionally, a difference in the gate potential changes
was observed
in the time course for sensitivity at lower concentration and gate
potential shift magnitude between the different CAs (Figure 5). In particular, the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET showed a higher sensitivity to LD because the Vout decreases upon LD addition starting at 1 nM, whereas
the other CAs barely caused the Vout to
decrease at 40 nM. To evaluate the affinity of PBA in the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET with each CA, the kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting
the ΔVout at each concentration
of CA to a Langmuir adsorption isotherm (eq 3). 3  where Vmax is
the maximum Vout shift, reflecting the
amount of each CA adsorption to the surface of poly(PBA–LD/LD),
and Ks is the binding constant. Figure 7 shows the plots
of ΔVout at each concentration of
added CA from the real-time monitoring data in Figure 5 and curve fitting with the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. In Figure 7, a clear difference was observed in the
affinity of CAs to poly(PBA–LD/LD). The kinetic parameters
of LD were approximately 2 times higher than those of other CAs in Vmax, which reflected the amount of CA required
for saturated adsorption to poly(PBA–LD/LD), and about 3–5
times higher in Ks. Note that the poly(LD)-coated
gate FET did not show a well-defined selectivity to LD, indicating
a significant role of PBA moieties in this device (Figure S3, the Supporting Information).

curves using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm at different concentrations

Concerning the association constants of CAs, the fluorescence
and
cyclic voltammetric analyses have been reported using chemically modified
PBA molecules. Maue and Schrader developed a colorimetric sensor for
CAs and evaluated the association constants of CAs to be 2.7 ×
102 M–1 in LD, 2.8 × 102 M–1 in DA, 3.5 × 102 M–1 in NE, and 3.1 × 102 M–1 in EP.32 Secor and Glass calculated the association constants
of DA, NE, and EP to be 3.4 × 103, 6.5 × 103, and 5.0 × 103 M–1, respectively,
to boronic acid–containing coumarin aldehyde by monitoring
the fluorescence spectra.33 Additionally,
the electrochemical sensing selectivity for catechol was studied using N-hexadecyl-pyridinium-4-boronic acid monolayer films, and
the association constants of CAs were calculated to be 1.3 ×
104 M–1 in LD and 1.0 × 104 M–1 in DA.33,34 In this study, 1 or
2 orders of magnitude higher pKa values
were obtained from the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET than
in the previous reports, indicating that the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET could detect CAs with higher sensitivity. In addition, the
affinity to LD was improved in the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated electrode
from both association constant and saturated adsorption amount aspects.
This might be caused by the difference in the CA interactions with
the poly(LD)-base layer. It is expected that CAs are attracted to
the poly(PBA–LD/LD) surface by three binding forces: the di-ester
binding to PBA, π–π stacking of the benzene ring,
and electrostatic interactions with the functional groups in the CA
moiety. A computational study of PBA-based selective CA recognition
and experimental research of selective fluorescence LD sensing utilized
the three recognition points to explain the strong binding.35,36 In this study, because the affinity to PBA and π–π
stacking of the benzene ring can be considered to be similar to the
previous reports, the amino group of the poly(PBA–LD/LD) layer
is the major difference. Thus, we propose that the amino group selectively
attracts LD, which possesses a carboxyl group more acidic than the
other CAs. We conclude that the carboxyl group of the LD side chain
is the critical factor for the prominent affinity to the poly(PBA–LD/LD)
surface.

The detection sensitivity of CAs was evaluated from
the ΔVout in the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate
FET from 10 nM to 20 μM for each concentration in Figure 5.37 Semi-logarithmic plots and their linear approximations between ΔVout and CA concentration were obtained with
a correlation coefficient in the range of 0.890–0.971 (Figure S5, the Supporting Information). The slope
of the plots was 58.7 mV/[LD] dec, 28.5 mV/[DA] dec, 27.4 mV/[NE]
dec, and 33.5 mV/[EP] dec. The poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate
FET had a wide dynamic range from 10 nM to 20 μM, and the limits
of detection (LOD) were 3.5 nM for LD, 12.0 nM for DA, 7.5 nM for
NE, and 12.6 nM for EP. In Table S1, we
compare our results on CA and catechol detection with those from other
works that used electrochemical and fluorescent methods. The poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET is superior to the other sensors using various modified interfaces
because it exhibits a lower limit of detection (LOD) and a wider linear
range. It is considered that the sensitivity to CA is achieved by
a combination of a well-controlled, nanolayer interface of PBA molecules
containing poly(LD) and the FET that can detect charge changes at
the interface directly. Moreover, the poly(PBA–LD/LD) is easily
fabricated on the electrode, making it suitable for practical applications
in diagnostic sensors. In blood plasma, the normal LD concentration
is ca. 30–40 nM, whereas the other CAs exist in much lower
concentrations.38,39 In urine, the normal CA concentration
is reported as follows: below 10 μM for LD, 600 nM to 5 μM
for DA, and 100–800 nM for NE and EP combined.40,41 In lacrimal fluid, each concentration of CA in healthy individuals
is reported to be 2 μM for LD, 30 μM for DA, and 1.5 μM
for NE and EP combined.42 From these reports,
it is apparent that the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET has
sufficient sensitivity for the CA detection in various bodily fluid.
In particular, the highly sensitive detection of LD is expected to
play a role in the early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson’s
disease. Furthermore, the monitoring of LD concentrations is required
because administrated LD, as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson’s
disease, has a risk of causing serious side effects.

CA sensors
may have several applications in in vivo and in vitro
diagnostic devices because the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate
FET is easy to fabricate and reduces noise from the biological fluid
components. Furthermore, its self-polymerization property makes it
biocompatible with maintaining superior CA sensitivity. Room still
exists for increasing the specificity and accuracy of this FET before
practical applications are considered; thus, further investigations
are required along with in vivo studies.

Conclusions
In
this study, we investigated the fundamental properties of the
poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET. PBA was introduced to LD and
electropolymerized on the surface of an Au gate electrode. The poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
Au electrode was connected to a MOSFET as an extended-gate electrode
and the electrochemical detection of CAs was carried out using FET
measurements. The gate surface potential in the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET clearly decreased after 1 nM of LD addition or 40 nM addition
of other CAs. The affinity of CAs to the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated
gate FET was estimated from the gate potential shift using the Langmuir
adsorption isotherm. Obvious differences in the saturated binding
amount (Vmax) and binding constant (Ks) were found between LD and other CAs investigated.
The poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET may be useful for highly
sensitive and accurate biosensing of CAs in various bodily fluids.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Reagents
All the chemicals were obtained
from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. 3-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine (l-dopa, LD), 3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride
(dopamine, DA), l-norepinephrine bitartrate (NE), and l-epinephrine (EP) were purchased from Tokyo Kasei Industry
(Japan). For the synthesis of the phenylboronic acid–LD derivative,
3-aminophenylboronic acid monohydrate (NH2-PBA, Sigma-Aldrich)
and 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride
(DMT-MM, Wako Pure Chemical, Japan) were used. The n-channel metal-oxide
semiconductor FET (MOSFET, 2N7002) was purchased from NXP Semiconductors.
Ultrapure water (Ul-pure, 18.2 MΩ cm of purity, Komatsu Electronics
Co., Ltd.) was used in all the experiments.

Chemical Synthesis of PBA–LD
Derivative and Electropolymerized
Formation of Poly(PBA–LD/LD) on an Au Electrode
The
LD PBA-functionalized monomer was synthesized by mixing LD (10 mM)
and NH2-PBA (10 mM) with DMT-MM (10 mM), as a dehydration–condensation
reagent, in 10 mL of mixed solvents (water/methanol, 1:1 v/v). Dehydration–condensation
proceeded for 4 h at room temperature by inverting the sealed reaction
tube. The resulting mixture was washed with water and the organic
layer was concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The obtained solid
was dried in vacuo (0.3 g, 90% yield). The structure of the synthesized
product was confirmed by 1H NMR. The coordinate peak allowed
for us to identify the resulting product: 1H NMR (300 MHz,
CD3OD): δ 7.45 (s, 1H), 7.42 (d, J = 1.7 Hz, 1H), 6.98–6.92 (m, 1H). The synthesized PBA–LD
and pure LD were copolymerized auto-oxidatively. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(100 mM) was dissolved in an aqueous solution of PBA–LD. Thereafter,
500 μL aliquot of the PBA–LD-containing solution was
directly dispensed to a 10 mm diameter glass ring attached to the
Au electrode. After connecting the Au electrode as a working electrode,
Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference, and platinum as a counter electrode,
oxidative polymerization was carried out by applying 0.5 V to the
working electrode for 30 min using an electrochemical analyzer (ALS614E,

Layer-Coated
Au Electrode
The thicknesses of poly(LD) and poly(PBA–LD/LD)
on the Au electrodes were estimated by the ellipsometric analysis
using a rotating ellipsometer (model M2000U, J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.)
and WVASE32 software. The wavelength of the incident light ranged
between 200 and 1600 nm, and the incident light angled from 65 to
80° in 5° steps. To calculate the thickness of each layer,
the experimental spectra were fitted using the Cauchy model. The thickness
was determined as the average of at least three distinct measurements
from different locations on the substrate. The formation of poly(LD)
and poly(PBA–LD/LD) was checked by measuring the static water
contact angle using a CA-W automatic contact-angle meter (Kyowa Interface
Science, Japan). Two microliters of Ul-pure water was placed on the
surface of each substrate under ambient conditions. The contact angles
were monitored using a charge-coupled device camera, and the captured
images were analyzed using FAMAS software (Kyowa Interface Science).
The contact angles were calculated as the average of ten measurements
taken at different positions. The ATR-FTIR measurements were performed
using a FT/IR 4200 (JASCO, Japan). ZnSe was used as the crystal plate,
and all the spectra were recorded over the wave number range from
4000 to 600 cm–1.

Electrochemical Measurements
of the Poly(PBA–LD/LD)-Coated
Gate FET
To clarify the interfacial properties of the polymer-modified
surface, poly(LD) and poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated Au electrode was
connected to the gate of an n-channel MOSFET device using crocodile
clip, and the threshold gate voltage shift (ΔVT) at a drain current (ID)
of 4 mA and drain voltage (VD) of 2 V
was measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (B1500A, Keysight
technologies). Sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM) from pH 5 to 12 with/without
10 μM of catechol was used as the pH solution. The pKa was calculated by fitting the ΔVT versus pH data to a sigmoidal curve. To evaluate
the affinity of the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET, the output
voltage response to each CA was measured using a real-time monitoring
system. Five hundred microliters of phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
pH = 7.4) was poured into the poly(PBA–LD/LD)-coated gate FET
equipped with a 10 mm diameter glass ring and equilibrated until the
output voltage was stabilized. Thereafter, each CA was titrated gradually
from 1 nM to 20 μM. To suppress the gate surface potential spike
signal, owing to the effect of sample addition, the injection volume
was 1% of the total measurement solution volume. The time course of
the surface potential at the Au gate interface was observed using
a real-time FET source–follower circuit monitoring system.
Changes in the gate surface potential (Vout) were monitored by adjusting the constant drain–source current
(IDS) at 100 μA by connecting to
an Ag/AgCl reference electrode whose potential was set as 2.5 V of
the reference potential.
