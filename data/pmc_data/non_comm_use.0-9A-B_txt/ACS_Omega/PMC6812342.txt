The exploitation
of natural gas hydrate is always hindered by the
migration of water and sands due to gas production. Depressurization
combined with thermal stimulation is an effective method for hydrate
dissociation. This paper reported the influence of gas–liquid–solid
migration on morphological change of hydrate sediments in natural
gas production using visualization method. Different backpressures
combined with thermal stimulation methods were applied to simulate
natural gas hydrate exploitation. Pressure compensation was first
employed to study sediment recovery features. The expansion rate of
a porous medium layer under combined dissociation and different backpressure
(4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.1 MPa) was discussed. A 176% hydrate sediment
expansion rate was found after the combined dissociation at 0.1 MPa.
In addition, it was observed that the height of the water layer above
the porous media after pressure compensation was gradually reduced
with a decrease in backpressure and eventually disappeared at 0.1
MPa. It was also found that the disappearing water layer caused an
anomalous memory effect phenomenon. Expansion and subsidence of sediments
provide a better reference for hydrate exploitation and geological
safety.

1 Introduction
Natural
gas hydrate (NGH) is an icelike crystal that hosts water
molecules to form a lattice via hydrogen bonding, with gas molecules
filling the lattice.1 The formation of
NGH requires a certain temperature and pressure, so hydrate resources
are mainly stored in permafrost and submarine sediments.2−11 Worldwide, the available volume of NGH is estimated at 21 ×
1015 m3 and is proposed to be the largest source
of hydrocarbons on earth.1 It is assessed
that the total carbon content in NGH is approximately more than double
that in other fossil fuels.12 Therefore,
the importance of NGH exploitation increasingly emerges.

Hydrate,
a special phase-change material driven by both temperature
and pressure,13 has a wide application
(such as carbon dioxide capture and separation, separation of near-boiling-point
hydrates, hydrogen/gas storage, and seawater desalination).14,15 Therefore, the characteristics of hydrate dissociation need to be
emphatically studied in application and exploitation. Depressurization
has been recognized as the most feasible, economical, simple, and
technically effective method for utilizing NGH resources,16−26 and it has been applied in the Nankai Trough (Japan), Mallik (Canada),
and Shenhu Area (China).26−28 However, ice formation and reformation
of hydrate can be caused by the lack of energy supply in the depressurizing
dissociation.29 Hence, depressurization
combined with thermal stimulation has been regarded as the most promising
gas production technology.18,30

Gas–liquid–solid
migration is one of the most important
factors influencing hydrate dissociation.31 The dissociation of hydrates produces free water and gas, and the
flow of free water and gas results in irregular hydrate sediment structure
(including hydrate, free water, gas, and porous media). The dissociated
gaseous methane significantly increases the pressure inside the pore
space, and the methane also increases the interactive force between
the fluid and hydrate-bearing porous media; these phenomena may result
in the reformation of hydrate32−34 and the deformation of hydrate-bearing
sediments.35,36 Hydrate reformation could be
caused by free-flowing gas in sediments under local temperature. Hydrate
reformation can reduce the permeability of sediments and result in
the clogging of the penetration path;37−39 the deformation of hydrate-bearing
sediments counteracts gas–liquid–solid migration. In
addition, pore-scale phenomena, such as capillary phenomena and surface
adsorption effects, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of gas
recovery, especially in gas–liquid flow.40 The flow generated via the decomposition causes the migration
of small sediment particles.41 However,
it remains unclear why and how gas–liquid–solid migrate
in sediments.

There have been some studies on hydrate mining
by means of combined
dissociation, but the visualization method failed to present in gas–liquid–solid
migration. Previous research on natural gas exploitation has always
focused on the gas production efficiency of hydrate without analyzing
the morphological changes of sediments after exploitation. We analyze
the influence of combined dissociation on from the perspective of
gas–liquid–solid migration and discuss the formation
recovery status for the first time by means of pressure compensation.
This is a meaningful experimental study on the influence of hydrate
dissociation on strata.

In this paper, to elucidate the influence
of gas–liquid–solid
migration on hydrate dissociation, NGH exploitation was simulated
by varying the backpressure combined with thermal stimulation, and
the recovery features of sediments were studied using a pressure compensation
method. Gas–liquid–solid migration mechanisms were proposed
based on the observed change in sediment morphology. The expansion
rate of sediment under various backpressures was compared and discussed.
The effects of gas–liquid–solid migration on pore pressure
and pore evolution were also analyzed.

2 Materials
and Methods
Figure 1 shows the
experimental system. The formation and dissociation of hydrate sediments
were carried out in a high-pressure stainless steel cylindrical vessel
(two 70 mm diameter sapphire windows; effective volume of 1160 mL;
withstand pressure of 20 MPa). A thermostatic bath (XT5718RC-E800L,
Xutemp, Hangzhou, Co., Ltd. with an accuracy of ±0.1 K and temperature
varying from −15 to 50 °C) was used to regulate the temperature
of the vessel. Two resistance thermometers (Pt-1000 with an accuracy
of ±0.2%) were inserted into the vessel. The pressure in the
cylindrical vessel was probed using a Unik 5000 pressure transducer
that has a pressure limit of 25 MPa and a precision of 0.25% FS.

Figure 1 Schematic
diagram of the experimental apparatus.

The hydrate formation process was performed as follows. First,
550 g of glass beads with an effective volume of 180 mL (BZ-02, porosity
of 37.2% to simulate the porous media layer) were used to fill the
vessel, and then 200 g of deionized water (200 ppm sodium lauryl sulfate
solution) was injected into the vessel to mix the porous media. The
overhead volume in the vessel is 780 mL. Then, the vessel was purged
three times with methane gas and evacuated to eliminate the influence
of air in the hydrate sediment samples. Next, the bath was set and
kept at 15 °C, and methane was slowly injected into the vessel
until 7.7 MPa. When the pressure and temperature became almost constant,
the bath was set at 2 °C to fulfill the formation of hydrate
sediment samples. After the pressure and temperature had been maintained
constant for approximately 10 h (pressure decrease <0.01 MPa h–1), the hydrate sediment sample formation was considered
to be finished. The synthesized amount of methane hydrate was about
1.5 mol by computing, and the calculation method is reported in ref (24).

The experimental
process consisted of two main stages: (1) methane
hydrate (MH) dissociation by changing the backpressure combined with
thermal stimulation and (2) pressure compensation (after the completion
of hydrate dissociation, the gas was re-injected into the vessel).
Hydrate sediment sample preparation was required prior to hydrate
decomposition (the preparation process was given in advance). During
the hydrate dissociation period, the backpressure regulator was opened
and the temperature of the thermostatic bath was set at 15 °C
at same time. The temperature and pressure profiles and sediment morphologies
were recorded in the dissociation. The dissociation was considered
to be finished when no gas discharged from the backpressure equipment,
and the temperature and pressure in the vessel had stabilized (pressure
decrease <0.01 MPa h–1). After dissociation,
the backpressure regulator was shut off. Then, the pressure compensation
was carried out and kept the vessel pressure at 7.7 MPa.

The
formation and dissociation of hydrate sediment samples and
the pressure compensation were tested five times. The vessel backpressure
in the dissociation was 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.1 MPa. The sediment
morphology was recorded by a digital camera (EOS 6D, Canon Company,
lens model EF24-105 mm f/4L IS USM), and the temperature and pressure
were measured via data acquisition equipment.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Hydrate Sediment Dissociation
in Different
Backpressures Combined with Thermal Stimulation
A summary
of the experimental conditions and findings during the combined dissociation
is shown in Figure 2. The characteristics of hydrate dissociation were studied by controlling
the backpressure at 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.1 MPa. The pressure
in the vessel was approximately 3.5–4 MPa before the hydrate
dissociation in Figure 2b. The hydrate dissociation was mild when the backpressure was 4.5
MPa. Hydrate was initially dissociated by heating before the pressure
reached the backpressure. When the pressure reached 4.5 MPa, the dissociated
gas was released through the backpressure pipeline. At the 3.5 MPa
backpressure, the difference between the pressure in the vessel and
the backpressure was small, so the driving force was small when the
gas was released, and the temperature did not drop sharply. Moreover,
as shown in Figure 2a, there is a temperature buffering region under the combined dissociation
at 3.5 and 4.5 MPa. In this region, the temperature and pressure were
below those of the methane hydrate phase equilibrium and hydrate dissociated.
The heat absorbed by hydrate dissociation was almost the same as that
from the external water bath into the vessel, resulting in the temperature
curve remaining horizontal. The hydrate was dissociated dramatically
when the backpressures were 2.5 and 1.5 MPa. The intensity of hydrate
dissociation mainly depended on the pressure driving force (ΔP), which was 2 and 3 MPa in the combined dissociation at
1.5 and 2.5 MPa, respectively. The excess free gas was quickly released
and the pressure sharply decreased, which caused an instant drop in
temperature. When the temperature went down to a point, the temperature
curve was in temperature buffering. The point was defined as the freezing
point (ice was formed), which provided the heat for gas release and
hydrate dissociation in the temperature buffering region. The same
mechanism of temperature buffering was proposed by Chong et al.42 When the hydrate dissociation was at the backpressure
of 0.1 MPa, the faster gas release caused by a larger pressure driving
force resulted in the temperature decreasing to −7 °C.
The temperature then rose as the hydrate decomposed, and a temperature
buffer occurred when the temperature reached the freezing point. During
the combined dissociation, the backpressure was always lower than
the vessel pressure. Therefore, the combined dissociation was mainly
controlled by the difference between the pressure in the vessel and
the backpressure. A larger pressure difference resulted in a faster
gas release. The pressure difference was the largest within 0–10
min of the dissociation. The speed of the gas release would affect
the temperature in the vessel and determine whether there was ice
formation. The pressure difference determined the rate at which the
gas was released, thus affecting the temperature increase process.

backpressures. (b) Pressure changes of the combined dissociation.

3.2 Volume Expansion of the
Porous Media Layer
in the Combined Dissociation
Figure 3 shows the sediment morphologies in the first
hydrate formation. It was found that the hydrate first formed in the
water phase above the porous medium layer and then spread over the
vessel window. As the formation continued, hydrates also formed in
the porous media layer. The state of complete hydrate formation can
be reached at 300 min. As shown in Figure 4, the combined dissociation at 3.5 MPa was
taken as an example. Some of the gas generated by the hydrate dissociation
in the porous media would be stored in the porous media in the form
of pores. These pores increased the height of sediment. The formation
morphologies of hydrate sediments before the combined dissociation
are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

Figure 3 Sequential images of the first hydrate formation process.

Figure 4 Sequential images of the combined dissociation at 3.5
MPa.

Moreover, the sediment morphology
significantly changed after the
combined dissociation at various backpressures. Figure 5(I)b–f shows the final sediment morphology
after the combined dissociation. At the backpressure of 4.5, 3.5,
2.5, and 1.5 MPa, the height of the porous media layer increased from
30 to 37 mm and the expansion rate reached about 126%. The expansion
rate can be calculated as He/Hi × 100% (Hi is the initial
height of the porous media layer and He is the final height of the porous media layer after the combined
dissociation at various backpressures). Note that the height of the
porous media rose from 30 to 53 mm and that the expansion rate reached
176% after the combined dissociation at 0.1 MPa. The increase in the
height of the porous media layer is defined as the volume expansion
(VE). Top hydrate should not affect the expansion of sediment. Meanwhile,
compared with the initial state in Figure 5(I)a, a number of pores in the porous media
appeared after the dissociation. As shown in Figure 5(I)f, the number of pores after the combined
dissociation at 0.1 MPa is more than others. The experimental results
indicated that pore evolution is a key factor for VE.

morphology. (b–f) Final sediments

Schematic diagram of the pore channels evolution under the combined
dissociation at 0.1 MPa. (d–g) Schematic diagram of the pores
evolution.

According to observations, the
hydrate dissociation was divided
into violent eruptive and quiet vadose stages. In the violent eruptive
stage, many pores emerged inside the sediments due to the randomness
of hydrate decomposition sites during early dissociation. These pores
were occupied by free gas and water. The increment of hydrate decomposition
rate increased the pore pressure. When the pore pressure was eventually
higher than the sediment effective stress, a portion of the pores
evolved to channels in Figure 5(II)a,b. A pore channel was observed in the experiment in Figure 5g and the Supporting
Information (Movie S1). Unevolved pores
gradually enlarged with the increase in pore pressure in Figure 5(II)d–g. Using
the modified Peng–Robinson equation, the theoretical pore pressure
could exceed 2000 MPa.43 The pore pressure
created a sufficiently large force against the boundary particles
and pushed the porous media layer to “grow” gradually.

The evolution of pores was accompanied by the migration of the
particles. Particle migration rests with geometrical constraint, i.e.,
the relative size of the migratory particles with respect to the pore
throat size in the host sediment skeleton. If the size of sediment
particles is less than the diameter of the pore channels, then the
particles would migrate theoretically by the pressure driving force.
With the increase in the hydrate decomposition rate, continuous production
of water and gas caused the local pressure to increase, augmenting
the pore channels. The augmented pore channels provide the macroconditions
for particle migration, and the pressure difference caused by the
local high pressure supplied the driving force, resulting in sediment
particle migration. Meanwhile, the free gas and water in the pore
channels migrated along the direction of the pressure difference.

The migration velocity increase caused by the fast decomposition
rate changed the capillary force and resulted in fluid retention,12 which, in turn, affected the gas–liquid–solid
migration in the porous media and led to the partial blockage of the
pore channels. In other words, pore channels were converted to pores.

As the rate of hydrate decomposition decreased, the hydrate dissociation
converted to the quiet vadose stage in the later period, and the local
pressure was reduced. The pressure difference caused by the local
pressure was unable to overcome the sediment effective stress at this
time. The flow of gas was impeded by water and sediment particles
in the pore channels. That is, the produced gas and liquid were trapped
in the porous media layer. The pore channels became relatively loose
and filled with water and residual gas. Finally, as shown in Figure 5(II)b,c, the pore
channels are blocked by the gravity of the sediment particles. Overall,
large amounts of pores and blocked pore channels together caused the
VE of the porous media layer. Overburden sediment is the ubiquitous
environment of natural gas hydrate. Different types of overburden
sediments have different stiffness. Pores are generated by hydrate
dissociation in overburden sediments with different stiffness, which
change the volume of sediments.43 Pore
pressure also increased with increasing stiffness for formations.

Furthermore, when the pore pressure was higher than the backpressure
(0.1 MPa), the pores and blocked pore channels were not broken, and
the VE was more obvious, consistent with observation. The expansion
rate was at a maximum after the combined dissociation at 0.1 MPa.
However, a higher backpressure (4.5, 3.5, 2.5, and 1.5 MPa) could
break the pores during dissociation, and VE was not obvious, whereas
a small number of pores still existed under the higher backpressure
due to a higher pore pressure than backpressure, which resulted in
lower expansion rates in Figure 5(I)b–e.

Therefore, pore evolution was
divided into three stages: (1) production
of pores; (2) conversion of a portion of pores to pore channels; and
(3) conversion of some pore channels to pores and clogging of others.
The local pressure difference was the difference between the local
high pressure area caused by the accumulation of decomposing gas and
the relatively low pressure area, which was mainly to provide the
driving force for the gas–liquid–solid migration. The
pore channel, evolved from the gradually increased pore, was to provide
the path for the migration. These pores and pore channels not only
change the morphology of the sedimentary layer but also have a significant
influence on the sediment heat-transfer characteristics. In addition,
a high backpressure could break the pores and the pore channels, resulting
in a nonobvious VE.

3.3 Sediment Recovery Features
after Pressure
Compensation
To study sediment recovery features, gas pressure
compensation was carried out and the vessel pressure was kept at 7.7
MPa after each combined dissociation.

The sediment morphology
after pressure compensation is shown in Figure 6a–e. The height of the water layer
above the porous media (WLPM) after pressure compensation was gradually
reduced with the decrease in backpressure. A comparison of the morphology
of the sediments in Figures 5(I)b–f and 6a–e shows
that the difference is the number of pores in the porous media. After
pressure compensation, the number of pores decreased for different
backpressures. Therefore, the reduction of the WLPM was attributed
to the pores breaking. Under the combined dissociation at different
backpressures, low pressure pores increased with the decrease in backpressure,
and the pore pressure was lower than the compensating pressure. After
pressure compensation, as the backpressure decreased, more pores were
destroyed, more water entered the porous media layer, and the water
layer eventually disappeared for a backpressure of 0.1 MPa. Meanwhile,
comparison of the morphology of the sediments in Figures 5(I)f and 6e shows that an obvious subsidence in the sediments was found
in the pressure compensation after the combined dissociation at 0.1
MPa, indicating that the pore channels and pores causing the obvious
VE had been damaged. Therefore, for 1.5 MPa, the sediment morphology
has no obvious change. The backpressure of 1.5 MPa has a larger driving
force for hydrate dissociation.42 The combined
dissociation at 1.5 MPa can be used as a reasonable reference for
hydrate exploitation and geological safety.

Figure 6 Sediment morphology after
the pressure compensation at different
backpressures (a: 4.5 MPa, b: 3.5 MPa, c: 2.5 MPa, d: 1.5 MPa, and
e: 0.1 MPa).

As shown in Figure 6, the porous media layer height is basically
the same after pressure
compensation. The difference was the distribution of free water in
the porous media pores. The water completely filled the porous media
layer after pressure compensation for the combined dissociation at
0.1 MPa compared with others at 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, and 1.5 MPa. At this
time, the distribution of water was such that the water saturation
of the lower porous media layer was high and that in the upper layer
was low, as shown in Figure 6e. Therefore, the heat transfer characteristics of the sediments
enhanced due to water filling in the disappearing water layer (DWL).
The larger compensated pressure destroyed the pores in the sediment,
allowing the water to enter into the porous media completely. This
process was accompanied by the entry of gas, resulting in the tight
gas–water contact.

Overall, pores were damaged during
pressure compensation and water
entered the porous media layer. The height of the WLPM after pressure
compensation was gradually reduced with the decrease in backpressure.
In addition, considering the effects of backpressure on the efficiency
and geological safety of gas hydrate extraction, the combined dissociation
at 1.5 MPa has little effect on the morphology of hydrate sediments
and acts as a larger driving force for hydrate dissociation.

3.4 Anomalous Memory Effect Phenomenon under the
Disappearing Water Layer
Based on the special distribution
of free water after pressure compensation for the backpressure of
0.1 MPa, hydrate reformation was performed to further study the effects
of a DWL on hydrate reformation. Two hydrate formation experiment
groups were tested. One was carried out under the DWL and the other
with an absent DWL (the distribution of water was the same as the
initial state in Figure 5a). Each group has four runs of hydrate formation and dissociation,
and the experimental results correspond to Figures 7 and 8. Both MH formation
and dissociation were visually investigated via closed mode (the temperatures
of formation and dissociation were set at 2 and 15 °C, respectively).
The closed mode means that the vessel remained closed during MH formation
and dissociation without the gas being discharged, and the driving
force only depended on temperature.

MH formation under the
DWL (a: before first formation, b: before 1st re-formation correspond

correspond to after the second closed dissociation, and d: before
3rd re-formation correspond to after the third closed dissociation).
(e) Four runs of the hydrate formation.

The four hydrate formation runs without a DWL are shown in Figure 8e. The first formation
induction time was 138 min, and the times for three re-formations
were 76, 72, and 64.5 min. The induction time computing method can
be seen in ref (44). The induction time of first formation was much longer than those
of the three re-formations, which is a normal phenomenon of the memory
effect. Research found that the induction time of hydrate reformation
was much shorter than that of the first formation, although reformed
hydrates still melted at the same dissociation temperature. This phenomenon
was defined as the memory effect.45 However,
as shown in Figure 7e, for the four hydrate formation runs under the DWL, the induction
time of the first formation was only 39 min, and the times for the
three re-formations were 62, 55, and 61 min. The induction time of
the first formation was shorter than that of the re-formations, which
is an anomalous memory effect phenomenon. This was verified by repeated
experiments in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). A comparison of the sediment morphology in Figures 7 and 8 shows that a significant difference was found with the WLPM before
the first formation. As shown in Figure 7a, the WLPM was invisible. The WLPM appeared
again after the closed dissociation in Figure 7b–d. Subsequently, the water layer
no longer disappeared. The induction time of the first formation was
obviously decreased. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 8, the WLPM existed before each hydrate formation,
and the memory effect was normal. Therefore, it was concluded that
the anomalous memory effect was attributed to the change in WLPM.

The decrease in induction time in the first formation when anomalous
memory effect occurred can be attributed to three reasons: (1) heat
transfer; (2) microsize effect; and (3) change in the initial MH formation
point. The heat transfer characteristics of sediments increased and
promoted MH formation because of the water filling porous media. The
microsize effect augmented the gas–liquid contact area and
accelerated formation. The initial point of the first formation happened
inside the porous media layer, which led to a heterogeneous nucleation
and enhanced formation.46 More details
of the three reasons will be analyzed in a later article. The memory
effect related to the change in the water layer will be the research
focus in a subsequent study.

4 Conclusions
The MH dissociation with various backpressures combined with the
thermal stimulation method and sediment recovery features using pressure
compensation was investigated. It was found that the expansion rate
reached 176% after the combined dissociation at 0.1 MPa. VE was caused
by pore evolution, which was divided into three processes: (1) production
of pore; (2) conversion of a portion of pores to pore channels; and
(3) conversion of some pore channels to pores, while clogging of others.
Pore evolution is the effect of gas–liquid–solid migration
in the process of hydrate mining, which not only provides a theoretical
basis for the process of hydrate mining but also has a significant
influence on sediment heat-transfer characteristics.

In addition,
the WLPM height after pressure compensation was gradually
reduced with the backpressure decrease in the combined dissociation.
An obvious subsidence in the sediments was found with pressure compensation
after the combined dissociation at 0.1 MPa. Meanwhile, the experimental
results prove that the combined dissociation at 1.5 MPa had little
effect on the hydrate sediment morphology and a larger driving force
for hydrate dissociation. In essence, the variation of VE and WLPM
was the embodiment of the interaction among the effective
stress of sediments, pore pressure, backpressure, and compensating
pressure. The morphology of hydrate sediments after pressure
compensation indirectly demonstrates a formation change in the recovery
process, which is of great significance to geological safety.

The anomalous memory effect phenomenon was also found in hydrate
reformation under the DWL. The anomalous memory effect was attributed
to the heat transfer, microsize effect, and initial MH formation point
change. This anomaly, which is attributed to the distribution of water,
is a re-understanding of the memory effect and will redefine its mechanism.
Hence, the analysis of gas–liquid–solid migration characteristics
for gas hydrate sediments would be an important reference for hydrate
exploitation and understanding the mechanism of hydrate formation.
