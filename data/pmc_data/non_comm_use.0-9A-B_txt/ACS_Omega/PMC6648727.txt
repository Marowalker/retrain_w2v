In
this study, Liquidambar formosana tree
leaves have been used as a renewable biomass precursor for
preparing porous carbons (PCs). The PCs were produced by pyrolysis
of natural waste of leaves after 10% KOH activation under a nitrogen
atmosphere and characterized by a variety of state-of-the-art techniques.
The PCs possess a large surface area, micro-/mesoporosity, and functional
groups on its surface. A glassy carbon electrode modified with high
PCs was explored as an efficient binder-free electrocatalyst material
for the voltammetric determination of nitro isomers such as 3-nitroaniline
(3-NA) and 4-nitroaniline (4-NA). Under optimal experimental conditions,
the electrochemical detection of 3-NA and 4-NA was found to have a
wide linear range of 0.2–115.6 and 0.5–120 μM
and a low detection limit of 0.0551 and 0.0326 μM, respectively,
with appreciable selectivity. This route not only enhanced the benefit
from biomass wastes but also reduced the cost of producing electrode
materials for electrochemical sensors. Additionally, the sensor was
successfully applied in the determination of nitro isomers even in
the presence of other common electroactive interference and real samples
analysis (beverage and pineapple jam solutions). Therefore, the proposed
method is simple, rapid, stable, sensitive, specific, reproducible,
and cost-effective and can be applicable for real sample detection.

Introduction
In recent decades,
different allotropic forms of carbon materials
such as amorphous carbon, diamond, graphite, nanotubes, fullerene,
porous carbon (PC), graphene-templated carbons, and so forth have
been used extensively in catalysis, sensors, and energy-related applications.1−5 Among them, graphene and PC are chemically inert with high surface
area. These physicochemical properties make them efficient to be used
particularly in supercapacitors, solar cells, and electrochemical
sensors.6−8 PC owns unique properties, high surface areas, and
large tunable pore channels, showing advantages in fast diffusion
of molecules and the rapid electron transfer process, thus having
an extensive application in electrochemical sensors and so forth.9,10 Thus far, various synthetic methods such as chemical vapor deposition,11 arc discharge,12 laser
ablation,13 and chemical methods14 have been developed to achieve high-quality
carbon nanomaterials. More recently, the synthesis of high surface
area carbon for electrochemical sensing applications are turned to
natural biowaste materials.15−18 In earlier dates, the activated coke and coal are
used as the nonrenewable sources to generate high surface carbon,19,20 but they do not draw much interest. Afterward, organic/inorganic
moieties are adopted as the precursors to synthesize carbon materials,21 but the treatment is costly and unfriendly to
the environment.22 Recently, sustainable
PC derived from biomass or earth-abundant renewable resources has
attracted much attention because it is relatively effective, environmentally
friendly, and simple in the synthesis approach.23−25 For instance,
Liu et al. studied the nitrogen-doped carbon derived from biomass
(grass), and the carbon-rich nanomaterial was exhibited as a promising
fluorescent sensing platform for the label-free detection of Cu(II)
ions.26 Huang et al. developed the amorphous
oxygen-doped carbon nanosheet (O@CN) from tannin which was applied
as the electrocatalyst for efficient N2 fixation to NH3 under ambient conditions.27 In
addition, Wu et al. obtained the oxygen-doped hollow carbon microtubes
(O-KFCNTs) derived from natural kapok fibers using high-temperature
carbonization under argon flow. The O-KFCNTs were employed as an electrocatalyst
for a metal-free N2 reduction reaction to convert N2 to NH3 with excellent selectivity and to achieve
good electrochemical performances.28,29

Liquidambar formosana is commonly
known as the Chinese sweetgum or formosan gum, and its crown is pyramid-shaped
around 40–60 feet wide that becomes more oval as the tree ages.30 Its leaves are star-shaped with a fragrant odor
when crushed. Their colors change from green in the spring and summer
to purple, red, or yellow in the fall. Thousands of tons of dead leaves
are produced each year. However, it is easy to identify in the winter
by the one-inch fruit balls called as Lu Lu Tong
that hang from its branches, and its fruits have been used as traditional
Chinese medicine.31 It grows preferentially
in East Asia, and its wood is second only to oak as commercial hardwood.32 However, the tree resin was once made into gum
that was used by confederate doctors to treat dysentery in the troops.
Some organic substances were extracted from the sweetgum leaves to
be used as medicines as well as essential oils were extracted to treat
skin infections and other ailments.33 Their
dead leaves are also enriched in lignocellulosic materials.34 The abundance of lignocelluloses in the sweetgum
tree makes it a useful raw material for the fabrication of activated
carbon (AC). Herein, we took the dead leaves of the tree as a precursor
to derive PC.

Aromatic amines (AMs) such as aniline and its
derivatives (ortho-, para-, and meta-nitroanilines) are commonly utilized in chemical, pharmaceutical,
polymer, plastic, and dye industries in which the azo (−N=N−)
components are useful in foods and textile applications.35,36 In contrast, these AM compounds are suspected to cause potential
diseases such as carcinogens, skin, and eye irritants. Herein, we
developed electrochemical sensing based upon carbon materials for
fast detection of AMs in drinking and environmental waters.37−39 This electrochemical method was reported to be superior to traditional
sensing and monitoring techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis,
high-performance liquid chromatography, planar electrochromatography,
solid-phase extraction, and spectrophotometry methods.40−44

In this study, we aim to develop a binder-free, metal-free,
high-sensitive
electrochemical determination of 3-nitroaniline (3-NA) and 4-nitroaniline
(4-NA) in an aqueous medium. The as-fabricated carbon materials showed
high surface area, long-term stability, and easy substrate penetration
structures for 3-NA and 4-NA molecules. The PC-modified electrodes
were demonstrated to have remarkable sensitivity with an excellent
detection limit for 3-NA and 4-NA. The selectivity, stability, reproducibility,
interference effect, and analysis in real samples were also examined.
Moreover, such prepared PC-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
materials show unique properties and remarkable electrochemical sensing
performances.

Results and Discussion
XRD and Raman Analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of as-prepared carbons are shown in Figure 1a. All samples exhibited two broad peaks
with low intensity at 2θ = 25.3° and 43.4°, which
can be indexed to (002) and (100) spacings of the graphitized turbostratic
carbon structure, respectively. The resulting (002) crystalline plane
of graphite indicates the presence of graphitization in all samples.
A minor peak at 78.3° appeared corresponding to the (110) crystalline
plane of graphite following the KOH activation process in the PC600, PC700, PC800, and PC900 samples. The graphitization of PC was apparently enhanced after
the KOH treatment, and the enhanced crystallinity helped improve the
conductivity of the carbon material.45 The
raw sample, PC (without activation), and KOH-activated (400 °C
and 900 °C) PC samples were compared for their crystallinity
and phase and characterized by XRD patterns (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). In Figure 1b, two typical carbon peaks
at 1366 and 1606 cm–1 were identified in the Raman
spectra for the synthesized samples, corresponding to D (defect, sp3, A1g symmetry) and G (graphitic,
sp2, E2g vibrations) bands,
respectively.46 Usually, an intensity ratio
of ID/IG is
used to characterize the extent of the disordered carbon presence
in carbon samples,47 yielding 1.01, 0.99,
0.99, and 0.98 for PC600, PC700, PC800, and PC900 samples, respectively, indicating that the
synthesized samples have a less amount of defective sites in the structure
as the carbonization temperature increased.48 The resulting higher extent of the graphitic phase, associated with
the conducting phase of the carbon, could facilitate electron transfer
or enhance its electrocatalytic activity.

(b) Raman spectra of the PC samples.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption
The surface
area and porosity of the PC samples were studied by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
analysis. All samples displayed a typical type-IV isotherm,49 as shown in Figure 2a–d. The hysteresis loop shown in
a pressure range between 0.48 and 0.99 is categorized as type-H4,
which can be attributed to the capillary condensation taking place
in the mesopores.50 More detailed pore
parameters of PCs are shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). When the activation temperature increased from
600 to 900 °C, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area (SBET) increased from 688.5 to 1210.4
m2 g–1, and the total pore volume (Vtot) rises from 0.82 to 0.98 cm3 g–1. While comparing these results, the KOH activation
is found to be effective to increase the surface area by forming a
porous structure inside the carbon framework. Figure 2a1–d1 shows
the pore size distributions of as-prepared samples. Both micropores/mesopores
persist in all carbon samples, consistent with the results of the
N2 isotherms.51 For comparison,
the yield of different samples prepared by the method of chemical
activation with KOH is summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The results clearly show that as
activation temperature increases, the yield of O, H, S, and N decreases,
but the yield of C increases. At higher temperature, the aromatic
condensation may take place among the adjacent molecules, thus generating
gaseous products from the carbonized char to increase the C yield.
Additionally, the elemental analysis (EA) evidenced the presence of
the rich C and O elements in the L. formosana leaves collected from different places (see Table S2, Supporting Information).

adsorption–desorption isotherms and

prepared PCs with variable activation temperatures.

Structural Properties
The filed
emission-scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) micrographs of PCs are displayed in Figure 3. In Figure 3a,b, the formation of carbon particles with
a large smooth surface could be seen in the PC600 sample,
confirming that the carbonization process at 600 °C in an N2 atmosphere could convert the dried leaves to a valuable carbon
product. At higher temperature, the carbon products (PC700, PC800, and PC900) showed a rough surface
and highly porous sheet-like morphology with interconnected pores
arranged in an irregular manner,52 which
are displayed in Figure 3c–h. The formation of porous PCs was attributed to the mixed
treatment of 25 mL of 10% KOH solution with the PC powders. KOH was
melted at the lower temperature, and then K2CO3 was produced from the reaction of KOH and PC powder at above 650
°C. Finally, K2CO3 was decomposed into
K2O and CO2 at higher temperatures.53 K2O was reduced by carbon to produce
metallic potassium (K) at a temperature above 700 °C, which was
then intercalated to the carbon matrix. After washing, this intercalated
metallic K was eliminated, leading to the formation of pore structures;
the treatment processes are provided in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information.

porous PC600, (c,d) PC700, (e,f) PC800, and (g,h) PC900 samples.

Additionally, the microstructure of tree leaves-derived carbons
was examined using a field emission transmission electron microscope
(FE-TEM). Typical FE-TEM images of PC900 are presented
in Figure 4. The PC900 sample exhibited a cottony structure, consisting of highly
interconnected 3D hollow PC layers that overlap with each other (Figure 4a–c). The
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 4d) further shows two clear
rings, revealing the polycrystalline nature of PC900. The
two weak diffraction rings for the (200) and (101) facet reflections
of graphitized carbon reveal that the partial graphitization of PC900 may help increase electric conductivity.50

and the (d) SAED pattern.

The elemental mappings of C, N, S, and O as well as the overlay
images (Figure S3a–e, of the Supporting Information) were further examined to confirm that C, N, S,
and O atoms are uniformly distributed on the PC900 sample,
in agreement with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results
(vide infra).

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The surface states
and components of the as-prepared PC samples were furthermore analyzed
by XPS. Survey spectra scans (0–1200 eV) were used to quantify
the surface elements, of which only oxygen and carbon were present
as shown in Figure 5a. As shown in Figure 5b, the O 1s spectra of the PC600 is dominated by two components
with binding energies (B.Es) at 531.8 and 533.2 eV, whereas PC700 and PC800 samples show three peaks at B.Es of
532.8, 533.6, and 535.3 eV corresponding to the carbonyl (C=O),
hydroxyl (C–OH), and carboxyl (O=C–O), respectively,
as displayed in Figure 5c,d. These ACs contain significant amounts of oxygen on their surfaces.45 The O 1s peak in the PC900 sample
can be deconvoluted into four contributions (Figure 5e). As reported,45 the peak at 531.8 eV is related to the COO– group in carboxylate
and the O=C group, and the peak at 532.6 eV corresponds to
the C–OH and C=O functional groups, while the peaks
at 534.0 and 538.1 eV are attributed to the oxygen single bond (O=C–O)
in esters and carboxylic acids, and chemisorbed oxygen or water (H–O–H)
molecules. The absorbed water or oxygen can be attributed to edge-dangling
bonds induced by the high-temperature chemical treatment. The XPS
analysis yielded the surface oxygen contents in both mass percentage
(wt %) and atomic percentage (wt %) of all samples (see Table S3 of
the Supporting Information). The higher
O content is consistent with the formation of carbon–oxygen
surface groups. In addition, the relative percentages of oxygenated
functional groups increased with increasing activation temperature
with KOH treatment. The C content by the XPS analysis (in Table S3) is smaller than that by EA, whereas
the O contents show the opposite trend. These facts can be readily
understood because the number of atomic layers in the samples amenable
to the analysis is usually larger by the EA method than by XPS, and
further, the oxygen surface groups should concentrate on the surface
of ACs. In fact, XPS has been used for determination of the surface
oxygen content in AC. These results are smaller than the O content
obtained via EA analysis, suggesting that the O content on surface
of the KOH ACs decreases with respect to the untreated carbon. Most
of the surface of the ACs belongs to internal pores (micro/mesopores),
which are thus not probed by XPS. This may explain the difference
in oxygen content determination between XPS and CHN analysis. When
the activation temperature increases, the reaction between carbon
and KOH becomes more violent in PCs, resulting in carbon oxidation
such that the carbon content is reduced and that is why the oxygen
content increased after the activation at 900 °C (see Table S3).

spectra of O 1s.

FT-IR Study
The
surface of carbon materials contains
abundant functional groups among which the CO-type groups are predominant.
These functional groups present on the surface are analyzed by Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR), showing the spectra of carbon activated
at different temperatures (600–900 °C) in Figure S4, Supporting Information. The broad absorption
band at 3400 cm–1 indicated the presence of both
free and hydrogen-bonded −OH groups on the surface.19 The definite bands at 1628–1710 cm–1 may be assigned to C=O stretching vibrations
of aldehydes, ketones, lactones, or carboxyl groups.24 However, the band intensity decreased after activation,
especially at higher temperatures. It can be noticed that the peak
at 1222 cm–1 is observed for all the carbons, as
caused by the CO group (a stretch of C–O). The association/dissociation
of surface functional groups would determine the density of the surface
charge for electrostatic interactions and reactive sites for chemical
interactions (e.g., ligand exchange) between the carbon surface and
the chemical activation during pyrolysis.46

Electrochemical Studies
The PC-modified GCE was electrocatalytically
analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using 5 mM
[Fe(CN)6]3–/4– with 0.1 M KCl
as the supporting electrolyte versus Ag/AgCl. The EIS profiles of
the bare GCE and PC-modified GCEs are depicted in Figure S5a, Supporting Information. In addition, the charge
transfer resistances depending on various electrocatalysts were measured.
In general, semicircles at high and low frequencies may be attributed
to the electron transfer and mass transfer-limited processes associated
with ferricyanide ions, respectively.51 While a bare GCE showed a sizable semicircle with higher charge
transfer resistance (Rct), the PC600, PC700, PC800-modified GCE yielded
a notable decrease in the semicircle and Rct value. This indicates that the bare GCE gave rise to an inferior
electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the PC900-modified GCE, which exhibited the smallest semicircle and lowest Rct value compared to other electrodes showed
excellent catalytic performance due to the rapid electron transfer
process on the carbon surface layers (see Figure S5a, Supporting Information). Several works25,39,46 have been reported that higher
surface areas and larger pore structures are favorable for electrocatalytic
applications because the mass transport of the electrolyte is facilitated
to obtain higher catalytic currents. In this work, the PC900-modified GCE possesses larger pore structures that enable the electrolyte
solution to flow into/out of PC more easily, thus resulting in better
electrocatalytic performance. In addition, AC contains a variety of
surface functionalities, especially oxygen-based functional groups,
which may undergo electrochemically redox reactions. Hydrophilic functionalities
(−OH, −COOH, −C=O, etc.) are likely to
increase the wettability of the electrode and further facilitate the
electrochemical reactions (Scheme 1). The related redox reactions on the surface of PC
were proposed as follows:52,53

Scheme 1 Proposed Redox Reactions
on the Surface of PC
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a viable electrochemical technique
which
is used to measure the electrochemical properties of an analyte or
system. The CV profiles of KOH AC samples (PC600, PC700, PC800, and PC900) were carried out
at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 using potassium ferricyanide
as a redox probe, as presented in Figure S5b, Supporting Information. Owing to its low electrical conductivity,
carbon restricted the electron transfer probe ([Fe(CN)6]3–/4–) toward the surface of the GCE. Furthermore,
the scan rate influence of the high surface area PC900-modified
GCE was studied from 20 to 300 mV s–1 by CV (Figure
S5c, Supporting Information) showing that
the process is not irreversible because there is no significant shift
in the position of the peak potentials at different scan rates.

Notably, the total current obtained at PC900-modified
GCE is larger than that at the bare GCE. It may arise from a larger
surface area provided by PC to enhance the redox process probed by
the electrode. However, the peak current obtained at the GCE is stronger
than that at the PC900-modified GCE. The peak current as
a function of the scan rate at the PC900-modified GCE is
shown in Figure S5d, Supporting Information, yielding a linear relationship between oxidation peak current and
the square root of the scan rate at the developed electrode.

Generally, most of the AC materials require the use of polymer
binders, such as poly(vinylene fluoride) and Nafion to fabricate the
working electrode.54−56 However, the use of these binders can lead to structural
disintegration under chemical attacks, such that reduced electrical
conductivity and increased mass transfer resistance may happen. Besides,
the involvement of these binders may increase the inner resistance
and introduce unnecessary weight.57,58 Herein, we
facilely achieved a binder-free PC900/GCE electrode material
and studied the possibility of its utilization in the voltammetric
determination of nitro isomers. As such, the electrochemical performances
in 50 μM of nitro isomers (3-NA and 4-NA) toward PC900 is directly applied without the binder and with the binder (Nafion)
GCE in N2-saturated 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS)
(pH 7.0) aqueous electrolyte (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the CV measurements were performed
to study the electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared electrodes toward
nitroaniline isomers such as 3-NA and 4-NA. Initially, the PC900-modified GCE sensing toward the individual analytes, 100
μM of 3-NA (Figure 6a), and 100 μM (Figure 6b) of 4-NA in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH
7.0) at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 in the potential
range of +0.4 to −1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl was examined. Then,
CV measurements in the co-presence of 100 μM 3-NA and 4-NA were
also performed (Figure 6c).

Figure 6 CV profiles for the bare GCE and different modified electrodes
(PC600, PC700, PC800, and PC900) in the presence of 100 μM of (a) 3-NA, (b) 4-NA,
and (c) 3-NA and 4-NA with the N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS
(pH 7.0) electrolyte. Inset of the panels (a1–c1) indicate the corresponding histogram of the reduction current
with different modified electrodes, and (d) CVs obtained for the PC900-modified GCE at varied pHs from 3.0 to 11.0 in the presence
of 100 μM of the 3-NA and 4-NA mixture. The insets of the panels
(d1 and d2) correspond to the 3-NA and 4-NA
peak current (Ipc) and peak potential
(Epc) at the PC900-modified
GCE, respectively. All measurements were recorded at a scan rate of
50 mV s–1 under N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS
solution.

In the case of individual detection
of analytes (3-NA and 4-NA),
a sharp reduction peak appeared at the bare GCE and PC-modified electrodes.
Notably, the bare GCE showed an irreversible reduction, in contrast
to the quasi-irreversible reduction with PC600, PC700, and PC800-modified GCE. On the other hand,
a distinct reduction peak potential at −0.649 to −0.664
V versus Ag/AgCl was observed with the PC900-modified GCE
to reduce 3-NA irreversibly to 3-hydroxylaminoaniline (3-HAA). An
additional oxidation peak in the potential range 0.164–0.181
V was observed as attributed to the reversible redox of the 3-HAA
to 3-nitrosobenzene (3-NSB).59 The inset
in panel Figure 6a1 shows the histogram of the reduction current of 3-NA with
different modified electrodes.

Similar conclusions may be drawn
for the detection of 4-NA (100
μM) in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0) at a scan
rate of 50 mV s–1 for the bare GCE and PC-modified
GCEs as shown in Figure 6b. Note that the modified electrodes provided a sharp reduction peak
in the potential of −0.667 V, which is attributed to the irreversible
reduction of the 4-NA to 4-hydroxylaminoaniline (4-HAA).60−62 Various PC-modified electrodes and their corresponding reduction
currents were examined as displayed in the inset of Figure 6b1. We found a redox
peak pair detected at the potential range of +0.133 to +0.116 V, which
is ascribed to the reversible redox of 4-HAA to 4-nitrosobenzene.
Thus, the GCE and PC-modified GCEs exhibited profound electrocatalytic
reduction current at lower peak potential, indeed serving as a superior
electrocatalyst for individual detection of 3-NA and 4-NA.

Then,
the capabilities of various modified electrodes for simultaneous
detection of 3-NA and 4-NA were also assessed. Figure 6c shows the CVs obtained for the bare GCE
and PC-modified electrodes in the presence of 100 μM concentration
of 3-NA and 4-NA in N2-saturated PBS (0.05 M, pH 7.0) at
a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The bare GCE exhibited
poor redox behavior, indicating the inefficient electrocatalytic capability
when 3-NA and 4-NA were mixed for simultaneous detection. In contrast,
the PC-modified electrodes exhibited two sharp reduction peaks around
at −0.628 to −0.652 V and −0.718 to −0.741
V versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, corresponding to the irreversible
reduction of 3-NA and 4-NA. Apart from this result, the reversible
redox behavior of 3-NA and 4-NA was observed around +0.066 to −0.253
V, indicating that the PC-modified electrode is a suitable oxidation
catalyst for simultaneous detection of 3-NA and 4-NA, in good agreement
with previous reports.63,64 The inset in panel Figure 6c1 shows the reduction
current of 3-NA and 4-NA versus different modified electrodes with
a trend similar to the individual detection of the sample. From the
CV results, a small reduction peak current of 4-NA can be noticed
at bare GCE due to the limited electrical conductivity or deficiency
of active sites. The legible separate reduction peaks were observed
for 3-NA and 4-NA in all the tested electrodes, of which the PC900 electrode yielded the highest reduction peak current for
the two samples. The superior electrochemical activity for the PC-modified
GCE may be attributed to the high surface area and porosity possessed.
Especially, the metal-free PC900 with the functional moieties
brings about fast electron transfer during the electrochemical process
to provoke high electrocatalytic activity.

Because the electrocatalytic
performance of the electrode depends
on the pH value of the supporting electrolyte, CV curves were recorded
as a function of pH from 3.0 to 11.0 in the presence of 100 μM
of the 3-NA and 4-NA analyte in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS,
as shown in Figure 6d. With an increase in the pH values, the potential shifts toward
the right direction. In addition, the reduction current of 3-NA and
4-NA increase from pH 3.0 to 7.0 and then decrease from pH 9.0 to
11.0 (Figure 6d1). The inset (Figure 6d2) displays a linear plot of the reduction potential
(V) versus pH (3.0–11.0) for 3-NA and 4-NA.
The linearity may be expressed by Ipa(μA)
= −0.053 (μM) – 0.3148 (R2 = 0.9922) and Ipa (μA)
= −0.0517 (μM) – 0.2297 (R2 = 0.9926), respectively. This indicates that a maximum oxidation
peak current was observed with an electrolyte pH of 7.0 over the PC900-modified GCE. As such, pH 7.0 was chosen for the supporting
electrolyte for subsequent electrochemical sensing studies.

Proposed
Mechanism for 3-NA and 4-NA
The electrochemical
mechanism of 3-NA and 4-NA at the PC-modified GCE is displayed in Scheme 2. It is well known
that the pathway of nitro compounds detection involves successive
four-electron transfer and protonation steps.62,64

Scheme 2 Proposed Electrochemical Mechanism of (a) 3-NA and
(b) 4-NA at the
PC-Modified Electrode
During the CV measurement, catalytic reduction of 3-NA
tends to
gain four electrons and four protons (4H+, 4e–) at first to form 3-HAA; this is an unstable intermediate, soon
followed by releasing reversibly two electrons and two protons (2H+, 2e–) to form nitrosobenzene (3-NSB) and
vice versa (Scheme 2a). As for the reduction reaction of 4-NA, the same processes associated
with protons and/or electrons transfer are otherwise involved, as
shown in Scheme 2b.
Because the redox process depends largely on the position of the nitro
group and pH of the electrolyte,62,63 the nitro
group (−NO2) at the ortho position in 3-NA is expected
to have more rapid electron transfer reaction than the nitro group
at the para position in 4-NA. The electrochemical process involves
the formation of an intermediate compound (3-HAA or 4-HAA) at the
3- or 4-position of the benzene ring due to the transfer of two electrons
and two protons. In short, the electrochemical reduction of 3-NA and
4-NA is associated with an equal number of protons and/or electrons
transfer.

Feasibility for Individual and Simultaneous Detection
The electrocatalytic activity of the PC900-modified GCE
toward the reduction of 3-NA and 4-NA at different concentrations
was measured with CV performed under N2-saturated 0.05
M PBS (pH 7.0) at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The
CV measurements were recorded (Figure 7a) in the presence of 3-NA at a concentration of 50–250
μM. Under these working conditions, 3-NA exhibited a reduction
peak around −0.636 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is ascribed to the
reduction of 3-NA to 3-HAA, as mentioned above. Also, during the reduction
process, the cathodic current increased at reversible redox of 3-HAA
peaking around +0.0661 V, which might correspond to the 3-HAA reduction
to 3-NSB.

[4-NA], (c) fixed [3-NA] and [4-NA] in the range of 100–200
μM at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1, and (d) 100
μM of [3-NA] and [4-NA] at varied scan rates (20–300
mV s–1); the insets (a1–c1) are the linear plots of the reduction peak current vs concentration
of 3-NA, 4-NA, and their mixture, respectively; the inset (d1) indicates a linear plot of the reduction peak current vs square
root of the scan rate for a mixture of 3-NA and 4-NA. All measurements
were recorded under the N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0)
electrolyte.

As shown in the inset
(Figure 7a1), a linear plot of the reduction peak
current at the potential −0.661 V versus concentration of 3-NA
was obtained with a correlation coefficient (R2) better than 0.9969. This potential value was then selected
for further detection experiments. Likewise, the reduction peak current
as a function of 4-NA concentration (50–150 μM) was acquired
with the PC900-modified GCE in N2-saturated
PBS (Figure 7b). A
linear plot with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9971 is displayed in Figure 7b1. Obviously, the reduction peak
current increases proportionally when the 3-NA and 4-NA concentration
increases, suggesting that the PC900-modified GCE exhibits
effective electrocatalytic ability toward the reduction of 3-NA and
4-NA, owing to high active surface area, excellent electronic feature,
and good conductivity.

Figure 7c shows
that the CVs obtained for the Ipc increases
with increasing a mixed concentration of 3-NA and 4-NA. The corresponding
CV results using the PC900-modified GCE in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0) and the mixture of 3-NA and 4-NA (100–200
μM) led to linear dependences of cathodic current (Ipc) versus their concentrations, as displayed in the inset
(Figure 7c1). The linearity yielded R2 values of
3-NA (0.9913) and 4-NA (0.9885). These dependencies provide the basis
for an amperometric method for the simultaneous determination of 3-NA
and 4-NA by voltammetry.

Kinetic Studies
To examine the effect
of the scan rate
on the reduction peak current, the electrochemical performance over
the PC900-modified GCE was conducted in the presence of
analytes at different scan rates (20–300 mV s–1; Figure 7d). The
inset of Figure 7d1 shows that the reduction peak currents increased linearly
with the square root of the scan rates. The linear regression equations
are found to be    

This indicates that the reduction of
3-NA and 4-NA upon the PC900-modified GCE is a diffusion-controlled
process.62 As for an irreversible electrode
process, the relationship between the slope of Ipa versus scan rate (V s–1)1/2 is expressed by the Laviron equation as follows:63  where α is the cathodic electron transfer
coefficient, ks is the rate constant of
the surface reaction, n is the number of electron
transfer, and R, T, and F have their usual notation. The slope of the above equation
yields αn of 0.524 and 0.556 for 3-NA and 4-NA,
respectively. Generally, α is assumed to be 0.5 for irreversible
electrode process64 and consequently, the
values for the number of electrons (n) involved in
the reduction of 3-NA and 4-NA is nearby 4.0. In addition, trace amounts
of heteroatoms and surface functional groups may create the defects
and accelerate the facile electron transfer at the electrode because
the space between the electrode and electroactive species is reduced
by the π–π stacking interaction between PC900 and an aromatic structure of 3-NA and 4-NA.

Concentration
Effect of 3-NA and 4-NA
Apart from its
electrocatalytic properties, the PC900-modified GCE demonstrates
a higher capacity for analysis of 3-NA (Figure 8a) and 4-NA (Figure 8b). This electroanalytical study was conducted
using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). All electrochemical parameters
were initially optimized in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH
7.0), containing 0.2–115.6 μM of 3-NA. The inset of Figure 8a shows the calibration
curve for 3-NA and 4-NA reduction. The cathodic current peak height
of 3-NA increases linearly with its concentration in the range of
0.2–115.6 μM of 3-NA. The minimum concentration calculated
to be detected by the proposed electrode is 0.0551 μM (S/N =
3) in terms of limit of detection (LOD). Furthermore, we calculated
the linear regression: Ipa (μA)
= −0.099 (μM) – 1.402 with the sensitivity of
4.371 μA·μM–1 cm–2. Likewise, Figure 8a displays the DPV profiles of 4-NA, showing that the reduction current
increases with increasing 4-NA concentrations from 0.5 to 120 μM.
The inset in panel Figure 8b shows that the linear range was obtained for reduction current
as a function of concentration of 4-NA following a linear regression: Ipa (μA) = −0.129 (μM) –
1.015 with a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.0326 μM (S/N = 3)
and a sensitivity of 5.792 μA·μM–1 cm–2. The good analytical performance of the sensor
is due to the fast electron mobility and strong electron donating
nature of the high surface area PC matrix toward the reduction of
nitro isomers.

Figure 8 DPV response of the PC900-modified GCE in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0) under varied analyte concentrations
of (a) [3-NA] 0.2–115.6 μM and (b) [4-NA] 0.5–120
μM. The inset panels (a1 and b1) show
the corresponding calibration plots of the reduction peak current
vs concentration for 3-NA and 4-NA, respectively.

Selectivity and Stability of the Sensor
Furthermore,
we evaluate the selectivity of the sensor for detection of 3-NA in
the presence of 50 μM 4-NA (Figure 9a) or 4-NA in the presence of 50 μM
3-NA (Figure 9b); DPV
measurements were performed using the PC900-modified GCE.
Obviously, 3-NA increases its reduction current with concentration,
while the concentration of 4-NA was fixed constant (50 μM).
As shown in the Figure 9a1 inset, the reduction peak current of 3-NA is linear
over the concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 69 μM with an R2 value of 0.9963. The linear regression equation
is Ipa (μA) = −0.070 (μM)
– 1.708, and LOD was estimated to be 0.53 μM (S/N = 3).
Furthermore, the reduction current of 3-NA was directly proportional
to its concentrations, while the reduction current of 4-NA barely
changed. Likewise, Figure 9b reveals that the reduction current of 4-NA increased with
its concentration, while the concentration of 3-NA was at constant
(50 μM). In addition, as shown in Figure 9b1, the linear regression equation Ipa (μA) = −0.122 (μM) –
3.123 was obtained between the reduction current and concentration
of 4-NA with an LOD of 0.7356 μM (S/N = 3). The analytical sensing
performance of the proposed sensor was compared with previously reported
3-NA sensors, and the results are summarized in Table 1.

GCE in N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0) under varied concentrations

μM 3-NA, and (c) equal concentrations of 3-NA and 4-NA. The
inset panels (a1–c1) show the corresponding
calibration plots of the reduction peak current vs concentrations.

Furthermore, we
explore the sensor for practical applications,
and the simultaneous determination of 3-NA and 4-NA of the PC900-modified GCE was evaluated in the presence of equal concentration
of both analytes (3-NA and 4-NA). The DPV profile shows that the individual
reduction peaks sharply increases when their concentrations were increased
equally, as displayed in Figure 9c. The inset in the panel of Figure 9c1 displays two linear regression
equations Ipa (μA) = −0.050
(μM) – 2.057 and Ipa (μA)
= −0.077 (μM) – 3.635 for 3-NA and 4-NA, respectively.
However, the LOD of 1.2371 μM (S/N = 3) for 3-NA and 1.7254
for 4-NA are calculated.

PC-based electrodes have been widely
used in voltammetric studies
because of low cost, availability, stability, and easy modification
of the carbon morphology. There are a number of carbon-based electrodes
such as GCE,66 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),67 and most recently, graphene.73,74 Moreover, the proposed PC900-modified GCE-based sensor
indeed exhibits superior analytical performances with a wide linear
range and LOD compared to other previously reported electrode materials
for electrochemical detection of 4-NA, as listed in Table 2.61,65−75

Practical Analysis, Reproducibility,
and Selectivity
The practicality of the PC900-modified
GCE was tested
for 3-NA and 4-NA contained in different real samples such as cold
drinks (Figure 10a)
and pineapple jam samples (Figure 10b). The experiments were carried out with the additions
of 3-NA and 4-NA at the spiking level of 5, 10, and 20 μM in
blank cold drinks and pineapple jam samples. As summarized in Table 3, the recoveries of
the analyte in cold drinks and pineapple jam samples are from 94.80
to 98.87%. These results indicate that the electrochemical method
proposed in this work should be suitable for sensing 3-NA and 4-NA
in various food products.

GCE (a) 3-NA- and 4-NA-spiked
beverage drink sample, (b) pineapple jam sample, and (c) 0.5 mM of
potential interference species and 50 μM and 75 μM of
3-NA and 4-NA. All measurements were recorded under the N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0) electrolyte.

The reproducibility of the PC900-modified
GCE in presence
of 3-NA and 4-NA was evaluated showing the relative standard deviation
of 6.3% (n = 10) according to the current intensity
for the concentration of 100 μM 3-NA and 4-NA. Such reproducibility
is highly acceptable for an electrochemical detection of 3-NA and
4-NA. The stability was inspected by acquisition of the electrode
response with the same concentration of 4-NA and 3-NA within 15 days
interval. The current response was found to decrease to 93% after
30 days in the N2-saturated 0.05 M PBS (pH 7.0) electrolyte
system, which was stored at 4 °C for each experiment. The unchanged
curve shape and current after 30 days of successive scanning indicated
that the fabricated carbon electrode material (see Figure S7, Supporting Information) can be used for nitro
isomer long-term sensing applications with excellent electrochemical
stability. Additionally, the selectivity of the sensor was examined
using a PC900-modified GCE by DPV in N2-saturated
PBS (0.05 M, pH 7.0) solution with 3-NA and 4-NA together in the co-presence
of 0.5 mM in other possible electroactive interferences such as Cu2+, Hg2+, Pd2+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Cl–, and NO32–. Obviously, nearly no change in their respective peak potential
was found with additions of 3-NA and 4-NA (Figure 10c); these results further reveal that the
PC900-modified electrode may be exploited as a sensitive
and selective electrochemical sensor for 3-NA and 4-NA.

Conclusions
In summary, activated tree leaves-derived PC has been obtained
from L. formosana and applied as the
binder-free electrode material for the detection of nitroaniline isomers
(3-NA and 4-NA). The PC samples at varied carbonization temperatures
have been characterized by XRD, Raman, BET, SEM, FE-TEM, EDX, CV,
and DPV techniques. We found that mesoporous PC900 owns
a very high surface area, resulting in better electrocatalytic activities
for the reduction of nitroaniline isomers (3-NA and 4-NA) than the
other PC-modified electrodes. The developed portable electrochemical
sensor (PC900-modified GCE) shows attractive analytical
features such as good sensitivity, widely operational linear range,
LOD, and excellent selectivity. The surface area effect and functional
moieties on their surface are responsible for the higher sensitivity
with the ultratrace detection limit. Additionally, the PC900-modified GCE demonstrates good reproducibility and excellent long-term
stability. Furthermore, the presence of 3-NA and 4-NA in the beverage
and jam was determined, yielding satisfactory results. Consequently,
our proposed electrode can be used for the sensitive and accurate
determination of nitroaniline isomers in food samples.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
3-NA (96%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-NA (96%,
Sigma-Aldrich) (KOH, Acros) were obtained commercially and used without
further purification. The PBS at pH 7.0 was prepared by using 0.05
M Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 solutions.
The pH of the solutions was adjusted with 0.5 M H2SO4 and 2.0 M NaOH. A conventional three-electrode cell system
contained a modified GCE (working electrode), Ag/AgCl (in saturated
KCl; reference electrode), and a platinum wire (counter electrode).
All other chemicals used belonged to analytical grade, and all solutions
were prepared by using ultrapure water (Millipore).

Preparation
of Tree Leaves Carbon
Dry L. formosana (sweetgum) precursors were gathered
during the fall season from the campus of National Taiwan University
in Taiwan. In this work, hierarchical PCs were successfully prepared
by using fallen dead tree leaves as the carbon source (Scheme 3). The pretreatment of the
dry leaves can be processed by the following three steps. (i) The
leaves were washed with warm distilled water to remove impurities
and undesirable materials and dried at room temperature for 2 days.
The resulting leaf powders turn to brown color. (ii) Then, the brown
powders (2.0 g) were dispersed in 25 mL of 10% KOH solution. The mixture
was sonicated for 1 h to achieve homogeneity and then dried in atmospheric
air conditions. The carbonization and activation processes were carried
out at a single step. The dried leaf powder was heated at 600–900
°C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in
a tubular furnace under the N2 environment for 2 h. The
samples were left to cool to ambient conditions and removed from the
furnace prior to further analysis. Notably, the brown powder was totally
turned into black. The obtained carbons were washed thoroughly by
deionized water and then dried in an oven overnight. For comparison,
some products were rinsed by a diluted hydrochloric solution (0.5
M). The resulting sample was placed in air and dried overnight at
110 °C. PC600, PC700, PC800,
and PC900 were labeled for activated PC prepared from dead
tree leaves carbonized at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C.

Diagram for the Preparation and Application of PCs
Electrochemical Measurements
A three-electrode
system
as mentioned above was employed for the electrochemical performance.
The electrochemical analysis depended on a computerized electrochemical
analyzer (CH Instruments; CHI 1205b and CHI410a) workstation. Prior
to each measurement, N2 gas was purged through the electrolyte
for 30 min. EIS (IM6ex ZAHNER, Kronach, Germany) was used to characterize
the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared composites. To prepare
PC-modified GCE, ∼2.0 mg of PC powder was dispersed in 1.0
mL of water and sonicated for 2 h. Then, 8.0 μL of the aliquot
was dropped onto GCE to dry in air, followed by gentle heating in
a hot air oven for 25 min without any binder used.
