Cisplatin is a highly
toxic material used clinically as a potent
chemotherapeutic. While effective against some cancers, toxicity limits
widespread use and low solubility confounds delivery. To formulate
a better tolerated and more water-soluble form of cisplatin, we designed
a rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) technique with
supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2) to collect nanoclusters
of cisplatin embedded in dry ice, in a dual-stage collection vessel
cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. These nanoclusters were solubilized
in deionized water and further concentrated (up to 51.3 mM) by a Rotovap
process, yielding stable cisplatin solutions with solubility up to
15 × (w/w) greater than that of normal cisplatin. Extensive material
characterizations of the solutions were carried out to determine any
chemical and/or structural changes of the RESS-processed cisplatin.
In vitro cytotoxicity studies of these aqueous solutions showed increased
cell viability and early apoptosis compared to equivalent concentrations
of standard cisplatin solutions. In vivo studies using zebrafish embryos
revealed that standard cisplatin solutions were acutely toxic and
caused death of rapidly proliferating cells compared to RESS-processed
cisplatin, which were better tolerated with reduced general cell death.
Increased water solubility and matched chemical identity of RESS-processed
aqueous cisplatin solutions indicate the potential to open up novel
drug-delivery routes, which is beneficial for new pharmaceutical design
and development.

Introduction
The current trend in
cancer research is to develop noninvasive,
early-stage detection, diagnostics, and either an outright cure or
reduction of tumor burden for advanced cases.1,2 In
this context, the role of platinum-based drugs on cancer treatment
as a standard-of-care chemotherapy has been transformative. Four platinum-based
drugs, namely, cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, and nedaplatin,
are currently approved for the treatment of a range of solid tumors.
Among these, cisplatin has been the most potent antitumor and chemotherapeutic
agent used for the treatment of many solid malignancies including
head, neck, bladder, ovarian, and small and nonsmall lung cancers.3−5 Therefore, cisplatin represents a broad-spectrum anticancer agent.

The anticancer activity of cisplatin is largely attributed to its
potent effects on the genome of dividing cells. It causes inter- and
intrastrand DNA cross-linking, which inhibits DNA synthesis, repair
and replication, and gene transcription. Moreover, it also restricts
protein synthesis and cell proliferation6−9 and therefore is only partially selective
for tumors, as other rapidly proliferating cells are also affected.
Thus, the clinical utility of cisplatin is hampered by its toxicological
considerations. While the efficacy of cisplatin on certain types of
cancers, namely, testicular and ovarian, is unmatched, the extreme
systemic toxicity of the drug reduces compliance with standard treatment
regimens.10 This is aggravated by the fact
that treatments are in general target-unspecific requiring high dosage
levels inflicting extended tissue toxicity. It has also been reported
that cisplatin showed a variable cytotoxic response due to drug-handling
methods and storage conditions as they potentially impact its chemical
stability and water solubility.8−12

The mechanism of acquired cisplatin resistance is attributed
to
the increase in drug efflux, drug inactivation, alterations in DNA
repair, and processing of drug-induced DNA damage.6,8 Because
of this, cisplatin treatments have a tendency to induce severe side
effects like cochlea damage and hearing loss that relies on various
pharmacological parameters like the dosage type (single or cumulative)
and administration (schedule and means), systemic and individual factors
(skin pigmentation, age, blood pH, diet), and interaction with the
therapies.8−11 In addition to the cytotoxic effects, high dosage levels result
in a combination of side effects like nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity,
or ototoxicity.6−11

Several strategies to minimize cisplatin dosage without compromising
its efficacy have been attempted.6,13 However, the
poor water solubility of cisplatin (∼1 mg/mL),14−17 bioavailability, degradation in aqueous solutions, and intravenous
mode of administration are the main limiting factors in clinical applications.15−19 Cisplatin is formulated either in a saline solution for clinical
use or using a buffer (dimethyl formamide (DMF)/phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)) to prevent drug inactivation prior to administration
and to promote drug stabilization. Though cisplatin is highly soluble
in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), this vehicle results in decreased activity/deactivation
due to ligand displacement by the sulfur group in DMSO.16 Neat higher water solubility has the advantage
of enabling more effective and less toxic drug-delivery options of
cisplatin for the patients. One of the approaches to increase its
water solubility would be to exploit the Gibbs–Thomson effect,
a well-documented phenomenon of increasing solubility with decreasing
particle size.20,21 Among various available particle
size reduction technologies, supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2)-based processes are the most promising, as they are scalable,
nontoxic, solvent-free, and environmentally compatible.20−22

In this study, we aimed to improve the solubility of cisplatin
to increase the capacity for delivery as a chemotherapeutic agent.
We describe a new process to generate nanoclusters of cisplatin using
a custom-designed, constant (P,T) sc-CO2 process with a 15× higher water solubility.
We investigate the efficacy of these aqueous nanocluster solutions
from in vitro studies with HeLa cells and in vivo studies using early-stage
zebrafish embryos as a whole animal model for toxicity and efficacy.
We have recently shown that metal-based compounds delivered through
a novel trefoil knot structure effectively induce cell death in the
rapidly dividing cells of early zebrafish embryos and tissue culture
cells,23 demonstrating the utility of this
system for in vivo studies. This combined approach identified the
unique properties of a novel cisplatin formulation that could be of
importance for improving the delivery of cisplatin as a widely used
anticancer drug.

Experimental Section
Rapid Expansion of Supercritical
Solutions (RESS) Process
The schematic of the custom-designed
RESS equipment is shown in Figure 1. In a RESS experiment,
the process chamber is first loaded with 100 mg of standard cisplatin
powder (Sigma-Aldrich) and sealed firmly. Liquid carbon dioxide (99.5%
purity) is injected into the process chamber using a syringe pump.
The total volume of liquid carbon dioxide used for each experiment
is 265 mL. The operating pressure of the process chamber is increased
to 300 bar by a CO2 pump and maintained constant throughout
the experiment. In-built cartridge heaters are used to maintain a
chamber temperature of 40 °C throughout the entire process. The
above operating pressure and temperature are selected to convert the
liquid carbon dioxide into its supercritical state, i.e., supercritical
carbon dioxide (sc-CO2). A magnetically coupled mixer with
a rotation speed of 120 rpm is used to dissolve the cisplatin powder
in sc-CO2 and create a true solution. This mixing process
is continued for 6 h when the mixer is turned off, and the system
is allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. The outlet of the process chamber
is connected to a stainless steel capillary tube (125 μm ID)
via a manually operated needle valve.

Figure 1 Schematic of RESS Process: schematic diagram
illustrating the custom-designed
supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2)-based rapid expansion
of supercritical solutions (RESS) technique used for the precipitation
of cisplatin. Standard cisplatin powder (∼100 mg) was dissolved
in a continuous stream of carbon dioxide under supercritical conditions
(i.e., temperature and pressure of 40 °C and 300 bar, respectively)
in a process chamber. This mixture was allowed to expand at atmospheric
pressure through capillary in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled collection
vessel.

Cisplatin nanoclusters are produced
by depressurizing the process
chamber at a constant (P,T) by manually
opening the needle valve. The outlet of the capillary tube is directed
into a dual-stage collection vessel cooled below the freezing point
of solid carbon dioxide (T ≤ −78 °C,
coolant medium: liquid nitrogen). The expansion process accompanied
by a rapid reduction in density results in a turbulent, supersonic
jet stream, further cooled by the Joules–Thomson effect. The
combination of the sudden increase in super-saturation and turbulence-induced
high shear in a cold supersonic jet produced nanoclusters of cisplatin,
embedded in dry ice in the dual-stage collection vessel. These nanoclusters
embedded in dry ice were further dissolved in deionized water under
ambient conditions resulting in a true (i.e., clear and transparent)
solution (Figure 1).

The unique feature of the RESS process is that it eliminates the
Ostwald ripening phenomenon typically associated with any solution
precipitation process.24 During the depressurization,
extremely high super-saturation levels are reached in a short timeframe
resulting in the precipitation of cisplatin nanoclusters from the
sc-CO2 solution, in a cold supersonic jet stream of gaseous
CO2. Cisplatin has zero solubility in gaseous CO2, and hence there is zero Ostwald ripening. Our patented process
reported here25 describes the ability of
our process to produce a highly monodisperse and stable neat cisplatin
nanocluster dispersions in water without any surfactants or capping
agents. The aqueous dispersions were further concentrated using a
low-temperature vacuum evaporation system (i.e., Rotovap system).
Cisplatin remained dispersed (“solubilized”) in water
over a period of several months at room temperature without any notable
visual turbidity or residue.

Material Characterizations
Microscopic
Characterizations
RESS-processed cisplatin
aqueous solutions were initially characterized to confirm that the
drug retained its chemical and structural integrity. The solution
was drop-cast and dried on transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
grids, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
characterization was performed using a Talos F200X Field Emission
Gun (FEG) TEM equipped with Ceta 16M camera, with a lattice fringe
resolution of 0.14 nm at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. High-resolution
images of periodic structures were analyzed using Totally Integrated
Automation (TIA) software. Surface morphology of the dried films was
analyzed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM,
Quanta FEG 450). Samples were examined at a 10 kV accelerating voltage
under high-vacuum conditions. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterizations
of drop-cast and dried samples were done (Agilent 5500, Keysight Technologies)
in noncontact mode. A set point of 1.5 V was kept constant for these
measurements. The topographic scans were collected with a speed of
0.30 (In/s) for 512 points/lines. These scans were postprocessed by
Gwyddion 2.53 software, an SPM data visualization and analysis tool.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of drop-cast and dried samples
on silicon substrates were made using a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray
diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube operated at 45
kV and 40 mA in Bragg–Brentano geometry.

Compositional
Characterizations
The chemical composition
of these drop-cast and dried samples was determined by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attachment of FE-SEM (FE-SEM, Quanta FEG
450). The samples were examined at a 10 kV accelerating voltage and
a working distance of 10 mm under high-vacuum condition. EDS spectra
were collected over a period of 1 min. A confocal Raman microscope
(WiTec Alpha300, WITec Gmbh) at 532 nm excitation was used for chemical
composition identification. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,
AXIS Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical) was used to determine the chemical
identification and core-level binding energies. The photoelectrons
were excited with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source
operating at an operating power of 117 W. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
survey spectra were collected using a pass energy of 160 eV. HR-XPS
spectra of the elements (Pt 4f and Cl 2p) were collected using a pass
energy of 20 eV with a step size of 0.1 eV. Charging effects of the
sample were improved by adjusting the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV with a ±0.1
eV accuracy as reference for the surface as well as a local shift
of the entire spectrum, respectively. The residual pressure inside
the chamber was maintained at 10–8 bar during XPS
measurements. High-resolution XPS was used to assess the exact binding
energy location and oxidation states. High-resolution XPS data were
fitted with the Gaussian peak fitting procedure.

In Vitro Analysis
of Cytotoxic Effects
Cell Culture
Human cervical cancer
HeLa cells (ATCC
No. CCL2) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), 4500 mg/L dextrose, 4 mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich),
in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Once the cells reached ∼90%
confluence, they were split into fractions using 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and propagated or used in experiments.

Cell Treatment Solution Preparation
A 5 mM stock solution
of standard cisplatin was prepared in water, sonicated for 10 min,
and then diluted in DMEM without FBS to obtain final concentrations
of 10–500 μM. Likewise, two selected stock solutions,
namely, NC-5 (NanoCluster-Cisp-5 of 51 mM concn) and NC-4 (NanoCluster-Cisp-4
of 31 mM concentration), were diluted in DMEM without FBS to obtain
the same desired concentrations.

In Vitro Cell Viability
Assay
Cell viability was measured
using Cell Titer-Blue (CTB) assay (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), which
measures the reduction of the nonfluorescent resazurin compound into
a highly fluorescent resorufin product by dehydrogenase enzymes in
living cells.26 Therefore, the quantity
of resorufin product is directly proportional to the number of viable
cells. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in 100 μL of complete DMEM in standard 96-well
plates. After culturing for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with 100 μL of medium containing
standard cisplatin, NC-5, or NC-4, at the desired concentration, and
cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, 20 μL
of the CTB reagent was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at
37 °C. Cell viability was assessed by measuring the fluorescence
of resorufin product (λex/λem =
560:590 nm) on a Synergy H1MF Multi-Mode microplate reader (BioTek,
Winooski, Vermont). Control cells were treated with the carrier diluted
in DMEM without FBS, while wells with medium (carrier diluted in DMEM
without FBS) alone served as a blank. CTB reduction was determined
from the ratio of fluorescence of treated wells to control wells.

In Vitro Apoptosis Assay
Apoptotic cells were monitored
by using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis
Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), in which FITC-conjugated
annexin V binds to exposed phosphatidylserines in apoptotic cells,27 and propidium iodide (PI), a membrane-impermeant
dye, binds to nucleic acids of necrotic and late apoptotic cells.28

HeLa cells were seeded at a density of
1 × 106 cells/well in complete DMEM in six-well plates
and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells
were then treated with 25 μM standard cisplatin, NC-5, or NC-4,
and incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Subsequently, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested
using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 5 min, and then
resuspended in 1× annexin-binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). To 100 μL of cell suspension,
5 μL of FITC-conjugated annexin V and 1 μL of PI (100
μg/mL) were added, followed by incubation at room temperature
for 15 min. Immediately afterward, fluorescence was measured using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a BD FACSAria III cell
sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analysis was performed using
the BD FACSDiva software. A total of 10 000 cells/sample were
analyzed using the green channel FL-1 for FITC-conjugated annexin
V and red channel FL-3 for PI to determine the fractions of live (annexin
V–/PI–), early apoptotic (annexin
V+/PI–), late apoptotic (annexin V+/PI+), and necrotic (annexin V–/PI+) cells.

In Vivo Studies
Zebrafish
Husbandry and Treatment
Embryos derived from
natural spawning of zebrafish from strains of AB, TAB5, or TAB14 were
maintained in a 14:10 light:dark cycle in the NYUAD aquaculture facility.
The NYUAD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all
procedures. Embryos were collected within 1 h of spawning, unfertilized
eggs and abnormal embryos were removed, and embryos were sorted into
individual wells of a six-well plate prior to 6 h post fertilization
(hpf). Each assay for embryo viability or cell death included 10–20
zebrafish embryos per exposure and was repeated for at least three
clutches. Embryos were treated from 9 hpf to 5 days’ post fertilization
(dpf) with 0, 100, and 200 μM of NC-5 and NC-4 in embryo water
compared to standard cisplatin diluted from the same 5 mM stock used
for in vitro studies. We identified the lethal dose 50 (LD50) to be 250 μM for standard cisplatin (not shown), and therefore
chose concentrations just below this, namely, 100 and 200 μM
as subtoxic concentrations to test for toxicity in this model. Embryos
remained in the drug solution for the duration of the study and scored
for mortality at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hpf. To test the effects
of chorion on drug accessibility to embryo, the chorion was removed
using fine gauge needles prior to 8 hpf where indicated.

Acridine
Orange Staining for Cell Death
Surviving embryos
at 24 hpf were assessed as described23 using
Acridine Orange incorporation to detect cell death. In brief, embryos
were dechorionated and incubated for 30 min in 5 μg/mL acridine
orange made from a 10 mg/mL stock diluted with egg water. Following
exposure, embryos were washed five times with 10× volume of egg
water and then mounted on glass slides with 3% methyl cellulose using
the GFP filter on Nikon SMZ2500, equipped with a fluorescent attachment,
an LED light source, and a Nikon DSQi2 camera.

Statistical
Analysis
Data are expressed as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). All statistical analyses were carried out
using Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).
For in vitro cytotoxicity data analysis, statistical significance
between the different treatments was assessed using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. For
flow cytometry data analysis, Student’s t-test
was performed between the treatment and control groups. For zebrafish
toxicity studies, Kaplan–Meier plots were used for survival
and a log-rank test to assess statistical significance. For the acridine
orange assay, larvae with at least five cells that stained with acidine
orange cells were scored positive for cell death and one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to assess the statistically significant
differences of the treatments. A value of P <
0.05 was considered statistically significant for all of these analyses.

Results
To overcome the issues of solubility and toxicity,
we characterized
the structural and chemical integrity of the aqueous cisplatin solution
NC-0 (i.e., NanoCluster-Cisp-0) obtained by dissolving the nanoclusters
embedded in dry ice in deionized water under ambient conditions. We
used the Rotovap process in a stepwise fashion to create additional
formulations with increasing cisplatin concentrations. Starting with
NC-0, we created five formulations, namely, NC-1, NC-2, NC-3, NC-4,
and NC-5, with increasing cisplatin concentrations [NC-0] < [NC-1]
< [NC-2] < [NC-3] < [NC-4] < [NC-5]. These formulations
were neat nanocluster dispersions of cisplatin that do not have any
surfactants or other capping agents on their surface to stabilize
the primary particles. The uniqueness (i.e., novel characteristic)
of our process is that these dispersions are stable in water for over
a year without the need of any (foreign) surface-stabilizing agents.
In effect, the cisplatin has been solubilized in water. The thermogravimetric
analysis technique was used to determine the cisplatin concentration
of NC-0, NC-4, and NC-5 to be 8.36, 31.5, and 51.3 mM, respectively.
The calculations were performed from the weight percentages of the
material recovered at 100 ° C using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) studies. We have been able to obtain stable nanocluster dispersions
(“solutions”) with 15× times more cisplatin in
solution than the standard cisplatin solubility.14−16,19 Among these, NC-0 and NC-5 were characterized for
microstructural and chemical integrity. NC-4 and NC-5 were selected
for in vitro and in vivo studies along with the starting material,
referred to as standard cisplatin (RCref) (i.e., standard
cisplatin powder dissolved in water).

Material Characterization/Analysis
TEM, AFM, SEM, and
EDS characterizations of NC-0 are shown in Figure 2a–f. TEM data (Figure 2a,b) revealed finer nanostructures in the
size range of 3–5 nm. Lattice fringes evaluated from one of
the fine structures by high-resolution TEM imaging showed a fringe
width of 0.27 nm. AFM topographic data confirmed the presence of randomly
ordered and irregular-shaped structures (Figure 2c), and the height profile extracted from
the marked nanostructure is shown in Figure 2d. The size of the nanostructure measured
from the height profile is around 200–300 nm. SEM data also
showed irregular-shaped submicron-sized nanoparticles in the size
range of 200–300 nm (Figure 2e). Compositional analysis using energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) during SEM imaging (Figure 2f) showed Si, Pt, and Cl. The highest intensity
peak observed in EDS spectrum was due to the silicon substrate, and
the presence of Pt and Cl spectral peaks is attributed to cisplatin.
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for NC-0 films, drop-cast
and dried on silicon substrate (Figure S1), showed some of peaks associated with triclinic crystalline (β-polymorph)
cisplatin (PDF 00-050-0643).29

Figure 2 Materials characterization
of NC-0: (a, b) TEM imaging shows a
cisplatin nanoparticle of typical size of 3–5 nm in diameter.
Lattice fringes with a fringe width of 0.27 nm are observed. (c, d)
AFM imaging of drop-cast and dried cisplatin reveals irregular-shaped
submicron-sized cisplatin nanoparticles. (e) SEM imaging shows diverse
shaped submicron-sized nanoparticle with a typical size of 200–300
nm. (f) EDS spectrum collected for NC-0 shows the presence of Pt and
Cl in addition to silicon substrate indicative of cisplatin.

Confocal Raman spectrum of NC-0 (Figure S2a) showed characteristic cisplatin bands in the 100–600
cm–1 range, namely, a broad peak at 349 cm–1 (Pt–Cl) and a weak shoulder observed around 522 cm–1 (Pt–N stretching).30−33 Cisplatin is also reported to have Raman-active bands
between 1200 and 1700 cm–1 due to NH3 deformation modes.32,34 The Raman bands from the RESS-processed
sample (NC-0) compare favorably to the Fourier transform (FT)–Raman
data reported by Amado et al. using Nd:YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet)
laser with an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm. XPS spectra for NC-0
collected over the binding energy range of 0–300 eV are shown
in Figure S2b. The spectra revealed highly
resolved bands at 75, 100, 150, 197, and 285 eV for Pt (4f), Si (2p),
Si (2s), Cl (2p), and C (1s), respectively. Pt, Cl, and C are attributed
to cisplatin, while Si is due to the silicon substrate. High-resolution
spectra collected for Pt (4f) in the binding energy range of 68–85
eV (Figure S2c) revealed the presence of
three broad peaks that were deconvoluted into two doublets 4f7/2 (71.4, 72.5, 73.7 eV) and 4f 5/2 (75.3, 76.4,
77.8 eV) corresponding to Pt 2+ and Pt 4+ oxidations
states.35 High-resolution spectra of Cl
(2p) (Figure S2d) revealed Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2.36 The precise
binding energy locations were identified by deconvolution of the experimental
curve at 197.4 and 198.3 eV, respectively. The presence of sharp bands
in the high-resolution spectra at Cl 2p1/2 is attributed
to chloride ion from solubilized cisplatin in water.37 Overall, it appears that the RESS-processed cisplatin seemed
to (mostly) retain its chemical and structural identity. In principle,
these characterizations are expected to serve as a benchmark for our
future cisplatin optimization studies.

TEM characterization
of NC-5 (Figure 3a)
revealed a fine particle structure in
the agglomerates that is much larger in size than NC-0. High-resolution
TEM imaging (Figure 3b) confirmed that the lattice structure of NC-5 is identical to that
of NC-0. AFM data (Figure 3c) showed a combination of a distribution of 100–300
nm and 1–5 μm sized particles. The height profile of
a selected larger particle was around 700 nm (Figure 3d), about 3 times greater than that of NC-0.
SEM data (Figure 3e)
were consistent with the AFM observations and showed a distribution
of 100–300 nm and 3–5 μm sized agglomerated particles
that are much larger than those of NC-0. EDS data collected during
SEM imaging (Figure 3f) showed identical elements (i.e., Si, Pt, and Cl) observed for
NC-0. The presence of Pt and Cl peaks is ascribed to cisplatin, and
the dominant peak is assigned to the silicon substrate. XRD data of
the drop-cast and dried film from the concentrated NC-5 solution (Figure S3) was found to be similar to NC-0. XRD
data showed the presence of more significant primarily triclinic crystalline
(β-polymorph) of cisplatin peaks, consistent with the TEM data.29 In addition, NC-5 showed a distinct super-lattice
structure based on observed low-angle peaks. However, the structure
could not be elucidated as there was not a self-consistent ordered
spacing within the three low-angle peaks. Confocal Raman spectroscopy
and XPS data collected for NC-5 were found to be identical to those
of NC-0. Therefore, the data collected for NC-0 are only reported
and data for NC-5 are not included.

Figure 3 Materials characterization of the highest
cisplatin concentration
NC-5: (a, b) TEM imaging shows a higher electron density and spherical-shaped
cisplatin nanoparticles. Lattice fringes obtained for the highest
cisplatin concentration hold an identical fringe width of 0.27 nm
compared to NC-0. (c, d) AFM imaging of drop-cast and dried cisplatin
NC-5 reveals irregularly shaped nanosized (100–300 nm) and
micron-sized (1–5 μm) particles. (e) SEM imaging shows
spherical-shaped (5–10 μm) agglomerated cisplatin particles.
(f) EDS spectrum collected for NC-5 shows the presence of Pt and Cl.

Optical UV–vis spectroscopic data (Figure S4) of standard cisplatin (powder) dissolved in deionized water
(RCref) as reference show that it is identical to NC-0
with a major absorption band at 200 nm. NC-3 displayed a highly resolved,
red-shifted primary band at 230 nm and a shoulder at 285 nm. The dominant
absorption band (∼200 nm) observed for RCref and
NC-0 was absent in NC-3. The band located at 285 nm became more pronounced
as the [Cisplatin] is stepwise increased in these formulations, namely,
[NC-3] < [NC-4] < [NC-5]. Formulation NC-5 had two primary bands
at 230 and 285 nm. The observed red shifts of the major band from
200 to 230 and 280 nm at higher [Cisplatin] concentrations are attributed
to increased cluster sizes at higher [Cisplatin]38 consistent with our TEM observations.

In Vitro Cancer
Cell Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis
The
cytotoxic effects of standard cisplatin and aqueous cisplatin solutions
prepared via RESS processing (NC-4 and NC-5) were assessed using Cell
Titer-Blue (CTB) assay, which measures the reduction of nonfluorescent
resazurin into highly fluorescent resorufin in living cells. We treated
human cervical cancer HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of
standard cisplatin and compared this to the aqueous formulations of
cisplatin (Figure 4). As expected, cisplatin decreased the cell viability in a dose-dependent
manner, with the lowest cisplatin concentration tested (10 μM)
yielding a CTB response of 63 ± 1% of controls, while at 50 μM,
the response was lowered to 9 ± 3% of controls. The IC50 value is highly dependent on the experimental conditions, including
the incubation time and cell density, as well as the cell viability/toxicity
assay used.39,40 Nevertheless, the IC50 value of cisplatin calculated here was 17 ± 4 μM, which
is within the range reported in the literature.41−43 Similarly,
NC-5 decreased the HeLa cell viability in a dose-dependent manner
(82 ± 3 and 65 ± 8% viabilities at 10 and 50 μM, respectively;
IC50 = 72 ± 7 μM). On the other hand, NC-4 did
not adversely affect the HeLa cell viability up to a concentration
of 50 μM, whereas at concentrations of 100 μM and higher,
the CTB response decreased in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 162 ± 4 μM). In summary, both of the aqueous formulations
of cisplatin are effective at killing cancer cells, with NC-5 exhibiting
increased cytotoxicity relative to NC-4. However, both NC-5 and NC-4
were less toxic than standard cisplatin.

Figure 4 Aqueous solutions of
cisplatin exhibit less in vitro cytotoxicity
than standard cisplatin. Dose-dependent inhibition of Cell Titer-Blue
(CTB) reduction. HeLa cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
of standard cisplatin (displayed as St. Cisplatin in figure), NC-5
or NC-4, for 24 h. Cells treated with vehicle alone were used as a
control, while wells with medium alone served as a blank. CTB reduction
was determined from the ratio of fluorescence of treated wells to
control wells. The error bars represent the SD of at least four independent
triplet-well trials. ns, nonsignificant and *P <
0.05 compared to other treatment groups.

FITC-conjugated annex V/PI staining was used to evaluate whether
standard cisplatin and aqueous cisplatin formulations (i.e., NC-4
and NC-5) induced cancer cell death via apoptosis or necrosis (Figure 5). Treatment of HeLa
cells with cisplatin resulted in a large number of cells undergoing
early and late apoptosis (44 ± 4 and 54 ± 5%, respectively,
of controls) (Figure 5a–d). Similarly, exposure to NC-5 caused the majority of cells
to undergo early apoptosis (Figure 5d,e). Consistent with our findings of reduced cytotoxicity
of NC-4, cells treated with this compound had a higher population
of live cells (79 ± 6%), with much smaller populations of early
and late apoptotic cells (16 ± 6 and 3%, respectively) (Figure 5c,e), compared to
treatment with either standard cisplatin or NC-5. These studies verify
the greater efficacy of NC-5 at inducing cancer cell death compared
to NC-4. The higher prevalence of early apoptotic cells in NC-5-treated
samples suggests that the effect of this compound at inducing apoptosis
is slower acting compared to standard cisplatin.

In Vivo Studies of Zebrafish
Embryos
The early stages
of zebrafish embryonic development are characterized by rapid cell
proliferation. We used this as an in vivo system to test the effects
of these novel compounds on cell division by exposing embryos to standard
cisplatin and aqueous cisplatin formulations (NC-4 and NC-5) for a
period of 5 dpf and assayed for survival, as shown in Figure 6a. Standard cisplatin and NC-4
caused larval death at different timepoints, while larvae exposed
to equivalent concentrations of NC-5 survived the entire treatment
protocol (Figure 6b).
Of these compounds, standard cisplatin was found to be the most toxic,
with all embryos dying as early as 48 hpf, whereas the mortality caused
by NC-4 occurred much later (from 96 hpf). In NC-5, it was well tolerated
and did not induce any death during the 24–120 hpf.

Figure 6 Aqueous cisplatin
is less toxic than standard cisplatin in zebrafish
embryos. (a) Schematic of treatment timeline and assessment by mortality
scoring. (b) Survival at 5 dpf with LC50 indicated for NC-5, NC-4,
or standard cisplatin (Cis-Pt). (c) Kaplan–Meier plot showing
survival trend during exposure to NC-5, NC-4, or standard cisplatin

survival trend after dechorionation at 24 hpf during exposure to varying
concentrations of NC-5, NC-5, or standard cisplatin at indicated timepoints.
(e) Representative images of acridine orange-stained zebrafish 24
hpf embryos treated with different concentrations of NC-5, NC-4, or
standard cisplatin (Cis-Pt). (f) Analysis of cell death phenotype
in larval trunk using acridine orange staining. (N = 2 (5–7 fish per clutch)) *P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
and ****P < 0.0001 compared to the control.

Interestingly, larvae exposed to both NC-4 and
NC-5 failed to hatch
out of their chorion. Therefore, survival was assayed after dechorionation
at 24 hpf to rule out any effect of this on drug access to the embryos.
We observed a similar trend in survival for all compounds with and
without the chorion, albeit the absence of the chorion did sensitize
the embryos to standard cisplatin and NC-4 toxicity (Figure 6c), suggesting that the chorion
may slightly impede access of these compounds to the embryos but that
this was not a major contributor to the effects of these compounds.

Cisplatin induces apoptosis, and we therefore assessed the effects
of cisplatin and its derivatives in embryos at a stage when we predicted
the cells to be most sensitive to DNA damage due to the rapid cell
division in the head and trunk (24 hpf). We used acridine orange staining
for dead and dying cells on live embryos. All compounds induced some
cell death in the head of 24 hpf embryos (Figure 6d). Notably, this was a time point when NC-5
did not cause any larval death but did induce significant cell death.
This suggests that standard cisplatin and NC-4 cause widespread toxicity,
whereas NC-5 is better tolerated and only causes death of rapidly
proliferating cells (Figure 6d).

Discussion
We report, for the first
time, an environmentally benign, scalable
sc-CO2 RESS technique to produce an aqueous nanocluster
dispersion of potent anticancer drug cisplatin. The custom-designed
RESS process resulted in a significant (>15×) increase in
the
cisplatin water solubility. Increasing the cisplatin concentration
resulted in an increase in the nanocluster size. Materials characterization
showed that the process did not have any degradation effect on the
drug and retained its chemical and structural integrity. Therefore,
we conclude that this approach successfully generated a new formulation
of cisplatin that could be beneficial for reducing the toxic side
effects of this drug in cancer patients undergoing cisplatin-based
therapy.

Given the importance of cisplatin as an anticancer
agent, we first
assessed the ability of these aqueous formulations on cancer cell
viability in vitro. We found that HeLa cells treated with aqueous
cisplatin formulations (NC-4 and NC-5) had decreased cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls; however, these compounds
were less effective (toxic) than standard cisplatin. Our findings
show that the cell death pattern induced by NC-4 and NC-5 differed
from standard cisplatin in that NC-4-treated cells were largely viable
at the time point investigated, whereas NC-5 treatment increased the
number of cells in early apoptosis. We presume that those cells will
eventually proceed to late apoptosis. Interestingly, most NC-4-treated
cells remained viable throughout the treatment protocol, in contrast
to cisplatin-treated cells, where most were apoptotic. This suggests
either lower efficacy of NC-4 or that there is a delayed timeframe
of action of these aqueous formulations.

Zebrafish are a well-established
vertebrate system for toxicological
studies and preclinical drug assessment.44,45 The rapid cell division of early embryos is an effective experimental
model to evaluate chemotherapies and other compounds in the context
of nontransformed cells in vivo.46−49 Cisplatin has been shown to effectively
kill the hair cells of zebrafish lateral line,50−53 zebrafish have been used to examine
cisplatin, and other metal-based chemotherapies cause cell death.54

Our studies using this model showed that
NC-4 and NC-5 were better
tolerated than standard cisplatin. A similar effect was observed in
vitro. Thus, in both cancer and noncancer cells, standard cisplatin
has greater cytotoxicity than the aqueous formulations. This could
suggest that these new formulations reduce efficacy compared to cisplatin.
Alternatively, this finding could reflect a delayed release of the
cell-damaging agent (platinum), which would be beneficial to treating
cancer cells. Our finding that the LC50 for normal cells
was higher than that for cancer cells represents an optimal profile
for a drug designed to specifically target cancer. However, this effect
could be related to bioavailability, as some compounds may be more
accessible to cells in vitro compared to the complex multicellular
organisms. This feature is important for future studies to evaluate
the potential of these compounds for clinical use.

We were surprised
to find that in zebrafish embryos, NC-5 was better
tolerated than NC-4, as the opposite pattern was found in studies
with HeLa cells. This could be attributed to intrinsic differences
in the cell cycle control and DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells
compared to normal cells or could reflect the differential ability
of NC-4 compared to NC-5 to enter cells in vitro compared to cells
in vivo. Finally, it is possible that in vivo, these solutions have
different cellular targets. For instance, the lethality observed by
NC-4 exposure could be due to preferential targeting of the rapidly
dividing cells in the head and trunk, or a potent off-target effect
that interferes with essential functions in the embryo. In contrast,
NC-5 might only affect those cells that share features with cancer
cells (poorly differentiated and rapidly dividing). This would suggest
an exciting possibility that NC-5 could eliminate systemic toxicity
of cisplatin but improves the cancer-killing effect, making it ideally
suited as a chemotherapy treatment.

Summary
We describe
an advance in the chemical formulation of cisplatin,
an important and widely used cancer drug. By generating nanoclusters
of cisplatin, we achieved a 15× higher water solubility of this
compound. The targeted cancer cell-killing effects of these formulations
offer the opportunity to alter the drug dosage levels or drug transmission
routes. The higher aqueous solubility and selected organ toxicity
could potentially offer to open up a new and viable drug administration
route of cisplatin drug.
