Studies have aimed to quantify methane
emissions associated with
the growing natural gas infrastructure. Quantification is completed
using direct or indirect methods—both of which typically represent
only a snapshot in time. Most studies focused on collecting emissions
data from multiple sites to increase sample size, thus combining the
effects of geospatial and temporal variability (spatio-temporal variability).
However, we examined the temporal variability in methane emissions
from a single unconventional well site over the course of nearly 2
years (21 months) by conducting six direct quantification audits.
We used a full flow sampling system that quantified methane mass emissions
with an uncertainty of ±10%. Results showed significant temporal
variation in methane mass emissions ranging from 86.2 to 4102 g/h
with a mean of 1371 g/h. Our average emissions rate from this unconventional
well pad tended to align with those presented in the literature. The
largest contributor to variability in site emissions was the produced
water tank which had emissions rates ranging from 17.3 to 3731 g/h.
We compared our methane mass emissions with the total production for
each audit and showed that relative methane loss rates ranged from
0.002 to 0.088% with a mean of 0.030%, typically lower than reported
by the literature, noting that our data excluded well unloadings.
We examined natural gas production, water production, and weather
conditions for trends. The strongest correlation was between methane
emissions and historical water production. Our data shows that even
for a single site, a snapshot in time could significantly over-predict
(3×) or under-predict (16×) methane emissions as compared
to a long-term temporal average.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Methane
emissions from across the natural gas supply chain reduce
the environmental and climate benefits of using natural gas instead
of other hydrocarbon-based fuels.1,2 Methane, the
main component in natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). The
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) currently assigns methane
a global warming potential (GWP) of 86 and 34 over 20 and 100 years,
respectively.3 However, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) currently uses an older IPCC GWP of 25.4 GWP compares the effects of various GHGs relative
to carbon dioxide (CO2) over a given time. Therefore, leaks
of methane must be low for natural gas to offer a lower GHG footprint
than other hydrocarbon-based fuels. Alvarez et al. estimated that
total leak rates should be less than 3.2, 1.0, and 1.6% to see immediate
net climate benefits for fuel switching from coal, diesel, and gasoline,
respectively.1 In a recent article, we
reviewed publications spanning the last decade which estimated anywhere
from 1 to 17% of natural gas was lost along the supply chain.5

According to the EPA, natural gas emissions
contributed to 31%
of all methane emissions in 2015.6 Natural
gas emissions were classified as either combustion, vented, or equipment
leak emissions.7 Combustion emissions were
all of the emissions in exhausts created from burning natural gas
in either engines or burners. Vented emissions were those released
by design of properly operating devices, i.e., emissions vented from
pneumatic actuators which were powered by natural gas. Leaking emissions
were those from equipment that were lost unintentionally due to component
malfunction, i.e., leaking pipe threads. Recent studies have reported
on the following sources of emissions including production sites,8,9 gathering and processing,10,11 transmission and storage,12−14 distribution,15 and the transportation
sector.16

Unconventional wells that
were hydraulically stimulated produced
67% of the US natural gas production in 2015.17 Omara et al. observed that unconventional wells emitted 23 times
more methane than conventional wells, which is of concern for the
growing population of unconventional wells.18 However, when comparing emissions as a function of production, conventional
wells emitted more production-normalized emissions than unconventional
wells.18 The purpose of this study was
to examine the long-term temporal variation in methane emissions from
an unconventional well site and compare these new data with those
reported in the literature and to assess any trends. The well site
was located in the Marcellus region and included four unconventional
wells and associated equipment. This site is unique in that it directly
feeds the entire metropolitan area, and due to regional consumption
constraints, production rates varied between audits based on local
demand, see the Supporting Information Section S1 for site details. The data sets were examined with regards
to reported trends in the literature and serve as an example that
short duration snapshots in time may significantly under- or over-predict
emissions from natural gas well sites. In fact, temporal variations
have been identified as a contributor to differences between top-down
and bottom-up approaches.19

2 Methods
There are a variety of methods to measure methane
emissions. One
common method has been the direct quantification with systems such
as the Hi-Flow Sampler.8,20 However, issues with its use
in recent studies have been highlighted in articles.21,22 To eliminate any gas interference issues, we developed the full
flow sampling (FFS) system, which has been detailed in the literature.6 Variants of this system have been deployed in
programs funded by the Environmental Defense Fund, Department of Energy,
and Industry. The system has been used to measure methane emissions
from unconventional natural gas sites, conventional gas sites, compression
and storage facilities, heavy-duty vehicle fuel stations, and other
sources.13,16,23 The system
uses excessive dilution to ensure that methane concentrations in the
sample are low. The system’s methane analyzer is based on enhanced
cavity spectroscopy, which eliminates the effects of gas composition.24 The system operates similarly to dilution tunnels
used in automotive emissions measurements, whereby, the source of
emissions is captured along with dilution air, and the dilute mixture
is analyzed. The FFS is calibrated prior to use, and it has been demonstrated
to have an uncertainty of less than ±10% for methane emissions
rates from 1 to 1000 grams per hour (g/h) using simulated methane
leaks from mass flow controllers. Additional details on the system
and methods are found in the Supporting Information Section S2.

All audits occurred during daylight hours.
All equipment and sources
of possible emissions were examined with a handheld methane detector
(Eagle II, RKI Instruments). Only during the first audit was an optical
gas imaging camera used to detect sources and verify full capture
of the effluent stream (GF320, FLIR). The same sampling approaches
and verifications with handheld units were used in subsequent audits.
Sources that surpassed a threshold of 500 parts per million (ppm)
were marked for quantification with the FFS and photographed. For
quantification with the FFS, a site background methane concentration
was collected during component set up. For steady leaks and losses,
30–90 s of data were recorded, averaged, and background-corrected.
Any measurements that yielded methane emissions rates of less than
0.1 g/h (such as multiple wellhead fluxes) were set to zero due to
variability in background methane concentrations throughout audits.
The only equipment not directly measured with the sampling hose were
the enclosed gas processing units (EGPUs) and wellheads. The EGPU
units contained a significant number of fittings and pneumatic controllers
that operated on natural gas. As opposed to quantifying all point
sources separately, the EGPUs were sampled as whole units using their
system enclosure and sampling times varied, depending on operation
status and emissions fluctuations. Their average emissions were background-corrected
using the site background methane concentration. The wellheads were
enclosed with a tent to measure the total flux from all components.
Prior to sampling a well, the tent was erected above normal site soil,
and background flux data were collected for background corrections
of tented wellhead measurements. Tented measurement times were approximately
20–30 min, depending on methane enhancement above background
and emissions variations.

This site also contained a produced
water tank. Atop the tank were
the vent, thief hatch, and fitting for monitoring equipment. Each
was checked with the handheld unit and quantified separately when
the thief hatch was closed. On multiple occasions (audits 2–6),
the thief hatch was found opened and was sampled in this condition.
The sampling hose was connected to a plastic sampling bin, which was
used to sample effluent streams from larger sources while blocking
any prevailing winds. The sampling bin remained elevated on at least
one side to ensure that a seal was not created, which would have created
a negative pressure and overestimated tank emissions.

The site
contained two EGPUs, but only one exhaust stack included
an adequate sampling port to examine exhaust stack emissions. To quantify
these emissions, an S-style pitot tube was used with a handheld pressure
sensor and a K-type thermocouple to estimate exhaust stack flow. Multiple
bag samples were collected using a positive displacement pump and
10 L Tedlar bags. These bags were then transferred to the laboratory
and analyzed with an MKS Fourier transform infrared analyzer. Additional
information on component quantification is included in the Supporting Information.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Results
Table S2 includes additional information for the audit conditions.
Items that were identified as sources of methane emissions varied
from audit to audit. The following items were a source of emissions
during at least one audit: leaking components, natural gas-fueled
thermoelectric generator, two EGPUs, four unconventional wellheads,
a produced water tank, burner stacks, and a methanol injection system. Table 1 presents the summary
data from all audits. Data regarding exhaust stack emissions can be
found in the Supporting Information, but
their contributions were found to be negligible, see Table S3.

a The table includes the count of
total sources by category (n) and the number of active
components (n* actively flowing natural gas). Methane
emissions are presented in g/h and the relative contribution by source
category is presented as a percentage for each audit, where “i”
denotes the intermittent operation.

A methanol injection system was installed sometime
after the third
audit and represented a substantial new source of emissions during
audit 4 (∼31% of total). Its vent emissions were measured to
capture multiple pneumatic actuations, which yielded an average emission
rate of 540 g/h (included in the other category). The largest single
source of emissions was the produced water tank during audit 2, which
yielded an emissions rate of 3731 g/h or about 91% of the total site
emissions. It was initially thought that the emissions were higher
than the first audit due to the opened thief hatch, however, it was
also found in the opened position for all subsequent audits. In addition,
the produced water tank also showed a significant variability in emissions,
which contributed to the temporal variability in total site emissions.
Its emissions rates ranged from 17.3 to 3731 g/h. Only one of the
EGPUs was active during audit 2, and it operated intermittently. Here,
active refers to the unit’s burner being active (producing
exhaust stack emissions) not the status of the unit flowing produced
gas. Active status as in producing or flowing gas is denoted in Table 1 for all components.
Multiple dump events from the EPGU to the water tank occurred during
its intermittent operation, which likely contributed to the higher
tank emissions during audit 2. Its emissions were sampled between
the intermittent dump events during audit 2, and no audible dump events
occurred during the other audits. Figure S12 presents an example of the variability in uncorrected methane concentrations
collected from the thief hatch during this intermittent operation.
Wellhead emissions are presented as the sum of all four wellheads.
During audits 1 and 3–6, wellhead emissions were low, however,
during audit 2, a pneumatic valve on a wellhead operated intermittently,
which contributed to higher emissions; see Figure S11 for an example of the variability in methane emissions
due to a pneumatic valve operation.

Figure 1 presents
the cumulative site emissions and includes a breakdown by the major
categories of “wellheads”, “water tank”,
“EGPUs”, and “other”, where other includes
emissions from stacks (where applicable), quantified leaks above the
threshold, and any controller vents or other sources that were also
above the threshold. Error bars represent the ±10% measurement
uncertainty. Audits 1 and 2 do not include EGPU exhaust stack emissions
even though they were active; however, if the emissions were within
the range seen during audits 3 and 4, their impact would be less than
1%. The EGPU burners were not active in audits 5 and 6. The total
for audit 3 includes exhaust stack emissions, which were measured
from the only active EGPU. Audit 4’s total includes twice the
measured value, since both EGPUs were in active. Figure 1 also includes a line for the
arithmetic mean of the emissions from our six audits and the arithmetic
mean of well site emissions rates presented by Rella et al.25 It was noted that the well sites of the Rella
et al. study were in the Barnett region, which may have different
operating characteristics and older infrastructure. The figure shows
that cumulative emissions varied significantly, ranging from 86.2
± 8.62 to 4102 ± 410 g/h. The mean emissions measured were
1371 ± 137 g/h (n = 6), which were lower than
the arithmetic mean of Rella et al.25 −1740
g/h (n = 117).

Figure 1 Combined audit results with the mean presented
for comparison with
data from Rella et al. (n = 117).

We examined wellhead emissions rates for each well
over all audits. Table S4 includes the
total natural gas and water
production per well, which indicated if the well was active as well
as its relative production for the site. On the basis of the analysis
of the data, there were no clear trends between wellhead emissions
and activity or production rate. The background-corrected emissions
ranged from below the detection limit (<∼0.1 g/h) to 134
± 13.4 g/h. The mean emissions rate was 6.19 ± 0.6 g/h with
a median and standard deviation of 0.24 and 27.2 g/h, respectively
(n = 24).

Table 2 presents
the total measured site emissions, total natural gas (whole gas) production,
and relative loss rates for both methane and whole gas. Gas analyses
are presented in the Supporting Information and were 97.3% methane by volume or 94.8% by mass, thus, methane
mass flow rates were divided by 0.948 to obtain whole gas emissions
rates. Using the audit data with corresponding natural gas production
for those days, the production-normalized methane emissions ranged
from 0.002 to 0.088% of the production with a mean of 0.030%. The
mean whole gas loss rate was 0.032%. The last row presents an alternative
approach of using an average emissions rate of 1371 g/h for the total
duration of 655 days and the total natural gas production of 3602
MMSCF.

3.2 Comparisons
with Site Emissions Measurements
Many operators participate
in leak detection and repair programs.
The current trend is to conduct annual audits with optical gas imaging
technologies. However, these methods do not present data on total
mass emissions rates. In addition, GHG reporting programs often use
out-of-date emissions factors and include little information about
site activity. Though our quantification method required direct component-level
access at sites, they showed that mass emissions from a single site
at the component level vary temporally. The goal of some studies was
to examine larger populations of sites using direct or indirect quantification
methods. Other study quantification methods included direct quantification
with the Hi-Flow Sampler, downwind flux, and downwind tracer ratio
methods. A recent study of co-measured sites has shown that downwind
flux measurements using methods such as OTM33A may be less accurate
than onsite estimates or tracer methods.26 We compare our data with campaigns from across the country to assess
if our measurements aligned with emissions rates presented in the
literature. We note that the natural gas composition, operating procedures,
and equipment may vary from different regions, and these variables
could contribute to different emissions profiles. Table S5 includes tabular data for comparison.

3.2.1 Direct
As mentioned above, the
Allen et al. study, as have many others, used the Hi-Flow Sampler,
and this work has been criticized.21,22 Howard suggests
that sensor issues (transition and gas composition) could lead to
underreporting of emissions data.22 However,
a recent examination by Alvarez et al. suggested that sensor issues
may be a part of discrepancies, but that operator practices and general
lack of complete data sets could also lead to discrepancies.31 Therefore, we used data from Allen et al. to
compare with our emissions.8

As a
part of the Allen et al. study, they completed direct measurements
at 20 natural gas production sites; however, five of those sites operated
onsite compression and were excluded from our comparison.8 Allen et al. reported their emissions in standard
cubic feet per minute, and we converted their values to g/h with the
following equation for comparison with our data. Only methane flow
rates were used from Allen et al., neither their normalized data per
well nor their whole gas data were examined for comparisons.  Note that their total site data included
estimates
for tanks, whereas our data included direct tank measurements. Overall,
our site maximum and mean values were comparable to measurements from
both the Rocky Mountain (mean +15%, maximum −24%) and Appalachian
region (mean −32%, maximum −29%) measurements.

3.2.2 Indirect
Rella et al.,25 Yacovitch et al.,27 and Robertson et
al.,28 all used downwind
flux measurements of the site emissions, whereas Omara et al.,18 Goetz et al.,29 and
Yacovitch et al.30 used downwind tracer
methods. Our lowest emissions were on the same order of magnitude
as minimum detectable well pads measured by Rella et al. in the Barnett.
Our maximum emissions were on the same order of magnitude as unconventional
wells reported by Robertson et al. and the conventional wells reported
by Omara et al. Our mean emissions were 20% lower than the mean of
Rella et al., only 2% lower than the emissions reported by Robertson
et al. for the Denver–Julesburg (DJ) basin, and only 16% higher
than Allen et al. for the Rocky Mountain region. Overall, our mean
emissions were between the minimum and maximum values of other studies
that included unconventional well sites. The results of Yacovitch
et al. downwind flux measurements were significantly higher than our
results and the results from other indirect measurement campaigns.27 Their experimental design in the Barnett shale
region specifically focused on high emitting facilities, whereas other
studies did not, therefore, their results were likely not representative
of average site emissions. However, the mode for their production
pads in the Fayetteville shale play was 1000 g/h,30 which was similar to our mean emissions (e.g., 1371 g/h).

The results of interest were those of the unconventional well pads
examined by Omara and Goetz, which were collected in the Marcellus.
Our mean emissions were about 14 times lower than those of the unconventional
well pads of Omara et al. and about 6.5 times lower than those reported
by Goetz et al. The number of wells on unconventional well pads is
usually more than one, and the equipment count typically increases
with the number of wells per site. For the three sites measured by
Goetz et al., the well counts were 9, 9, and 7 or about twice the
number of wells on our site (4). For the sites measured by Omara et
al., the well counts ranged from 1–9 with an average of 5 per
pad. No composition data were reported by Goetz et al., but the compositions
of wells measured by Omara et al. varied from 73 to 95% methane (average
of 80%), whereas our natural gas was 97% methane. Since higher hydrocarbons
were produced at their sites, higher methane emissions could be attributed
to any additional produced water and condensate tanks and associated
equipment necessary for processing. We also note that Omara et al.
daily production ranged from 456 to 78 024 MCF/day (average
14 547 MCF/day), whereas our average daily whole gas production
ranged from 2978 to 9791 MCF/day (average 5766 MCF/day). Goetz et
al. also provided natural gas production for their sites in total
annual production for 2012, and their average production was 7123
MCF/day, which was also higher than the average of our site. This
suggests that their higher production rates may also be contributing
to their higher methane mass emissions rates.

Figure 2 presents
a comparative graphic of our data compared with those from the literature.
Note that Figure 2 excludes
some studies presented in Table S5. We
examined the mean emissions from all 14 studies and used a modified
z-score to identify possible outliers (>3.5),32 these are marked in Table S5. The data
presented includes the mean emissions in g/h with the error bars representing
the maximum and minimum reported values.

Robertson #3-UGR).

3.3 Component-Level
Measurements
We also
compared our measurements with component level measurements presented
in the literature, including the results from Allen et al. To remove
the impact of tanks, we used only their measured emissions data (excluding
estimated tank emissions) and compared that data with our site emissions,
excluding tanks. Table 3 shows that our nontank emissions were 2.3 times lower than those
in the Rocky Mountain region and 11.6 times lower than those in the
Appalachian region. The range of their estimated tank emissions rates
was from 12.1 to 5191 g/h. Their estimated tank emissions matched
well with our tank emissions, therefore, their site sources, excluding
tanks, were likely higher than our direct measurements, as opposed
to under estimated tank emissions. In addition, we compared our other
emissions with their fugitive category. Our emissions are those presented
earlier in the category of other with the exclusion of the methanol
injection system of audit 4. In addition, we excluded the emissions
from the EGPUs since they had a separate category for pneumatic controls.
In this comparison, we saw that our other emissions tended to be lower
than their fugitive values in both regions. Allen et al. also characterized
the emissions from 62 pneumatic chemical injection pumps.10 Though the methanol injection system was only
at our site for one audit, its measured emissions were within 15%
of the average emissions from the chemical injection pumps used in
the Gulf Coast region.

Regarding the wellheads
themselves, there is limited data available
on direct quantification of unconventional wellhead emissions alone.
The most recent studies have examined abandoned or coal bed methane
wells. Of our 24 wellhead measurements, we saw quantifiable emissions
(>0.1 g/h) on 18 occasions. Table 3 presents our non-zero wellhead emissions with those
of non-zero measurements of wells measured by Kang et al.33 and Townsend-Small et al.34 Our non-zero mean was 8.26 g/h, and the mean of the combined
data sets of Townsend-Small et al. and Kang et al. was 8.43 g/h. This
may suggest that wellhead emissions or fluxes are similar regardless
of well type, age, status, or location. However, our non-zero data
set (n = 18) was skewed, therefore, we used the modified
z-score approach to identify possible statistical outliers which strongly
influenced the non-zero mean. Removing these possible outliers (emissions
rates of 1.33, 4.29, 4.65, and 134 g/h) reduced the non-zero average
wellhead emissions to 0.33 g/h, at least 1 order of magnitude lower
than their mean values. We found no correlation between site activity
and zeros or possible outliers. Out of the total number of wellhead
measurements (n = 24), zero emissions occurred 25%
of the time (n = 6), whereas statistical outliers
accounted for 17% of measurements (n = 4). Alternatively,
the geometric mean of our non-zero emissions was 0.6 g/h. This may
suggest that new unconventional wellheads may tend to have lower emissions
than others. In this case, wellhead emissions were low and did not
contribute significantly to sitewide emissions (maximum < 1.9%)

3.4 Variability and Correlations
As discussed
earlier, the produced water tank was the predominant source of methane
emissions for audits 2, 4, and 5, and its mass emissions varied by
a factor of 216. Most produced water tank vents are not controlled
and, ultimately, vent to the atmosphere. Methane emissions from vents
or hatches can occur via vented gas during dumping, displacement of
gases within the tank due to liquid level changes, and desorption
of gases from the liquids. Both natural gas and water production rates
were available for this site daily. We examined the total site methane
emissions, tank emissions, and nontank emissions based on the daily
natural gas and water production. Figures S13 and S14 show that there were no significant correlations between
total emissions compared with natural gas or water production. At
the same time, we compared nontank emissions with natural gas production
alone and found a weak positive correlation between increased nontank
emissions and production, see Figure S15. Since tank emissions were the predominant and most variable source,
we compared tank only emissions with the water production, which showed
no significant correlation, see Figure S16. However, based on the three possible avenues of tank emissions
described above, we then examined correlations of tank emissions with
historical water production. In doing so, we found the strongest positive
correlation between increased methane emissions from the tank and
historical water production, showing the highest coefficient of determination
value (R2 = 0.89) using 3 day total water
production, see Figure S17. Therefore,
we postulate that variability in tank emissions is primarily due to
variability in water production, and total site emissions are impacted
by a combination of both water and natural gas production. We aim
to double our sample size within the next 24 months to better understand
if current correlations continue to hold true.

4 Conclusions and Recommendations
Numerous studies have focused
on the quantification of methane
emissions from natural gas sites. Many of these studies have focused
on increasing sample sizes spatio-temporally to ensure representative
results, however, our goal was to assess the temporal variability
of emissions from an unconventional well site over the period of about
2 years (21 months). We completed direct quantification using a custom
full flow sampling system with a measurement uncertainty of ±10%.
Our results followed trends suggested by sampling multiple sites:
most emissions were attributed to a smaller number of emitters, and
like spatio-temporal measurements, temporal only measurements
were also highly variable and driven by tank emissions. The total
methane emissions from our site varied between 86.2 and 4102 g/h.
If the average site emissions of 1371 g/h were representative, using
a single audit could have under estimated annual emissions by a factor
of 16 or overestimated emissions by a factor of 3. Thus, even with
direct quantification methods, methane emissions remain highly variable,
and a single snapshot in time may not accurately reflect average emissions
rates. We note that even though measurements were repeated 6 times
to assess variability, our data still may not encompass all variability,
and we will continue to conduct audits over the next 18–24
months. The largest and most variable source of emissions from all
audits was the produced water tank, whose peak emission was 3731 g/h.
We examined our variable emissions compared to the total site production
of natural gas and water production rates. Our strongest correlation
was increased tank emissions as predicted from increased water production
over a period of 3 days. A weaker correlation existed between total
site emissions and 3 day water production rates. Overall, our component
and site level emissions were typically within the range of minimum
and maximum values reported in the literature. Thus, it is shown that
repeated measurements at sites may yield significantly different results
over time, depending on current and recent site activity.
