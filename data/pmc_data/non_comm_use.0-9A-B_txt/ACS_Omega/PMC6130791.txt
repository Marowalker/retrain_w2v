U1 small ribonucleoproteins
demonstrate proteopathy in Alzheimer’s
disease, and their inhibition modulates the expression of the amyloid
precursor protein (APP). We sought to determine whether this effect
on the APP expression is a universal result of different kinds of
RNA splicing inhibitions. We treated cells with two chemical RNA splicing
inhibitors: isoginkgetin (IGK) and spliceostatin A (SSA), in which
SSA reduced the APP expression, whereas IGK substantially increased
it. The following western blot and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction analyses showed that the APP expression under the IGK
treatment has distinct protein forms, but the total mRNA level was
nearly unchanged despite a slight switch within its three major transcripts.
Further analysis revealed that the APP-increasing effect of IGK depended
on protein translation and might involve inhibition in the degradation
system. By immunocytochemistry, the APP likely redistributed from
Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells treated with IGK. When
compared to the well-characterized ER-to-Golgi transport inhibitor
brefeldin A, IGK showed similar APP expression patterns on the western
blot. In summary, we not only determined the diverse effects of RNA
splicing inhibition on the APP expression but also found the additional
function of IGK on protein subcellular traffic.

==== Body
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an
aging-related irreversible
neurodegenerative disorder. AD brains are hallmarked by the extracellular
amyloid plaques and the intracellular tangles.1 The major components of the plaques are the Aβ peptides generated
from the amyloid precursor protein (APP).1,2 Currently,
all three AD familial genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) are directly involved
in the Aβ generation, which, in combination with other genetic
evidence, confirms the essential role of the amyloid cascade in the
AD pathogenesis.3

We have discovered
the AD-specific, widespread, and early occurring
proteopathy of the U1 small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and
the concomitant RNA splicing deficiency in AD.4−6 Importantly,
U1 inhibition by U1-70K knockdown was intriguingly found to increase
APP expression and Aβ production,4 providing an important clue to the mechanism of Aβ accumulation
in AD.

We therefore sought to determine whether this APP-increasing
effect
is a general result of all different kinds of RNA splicing inhibitions
or is only specific to the U1 inhibition. In this study, we used two
chemical RNA splicing inhibitors isoginkgetin (IGK) and spliceostatin
A (SSA) to treat cells and then examined the APP expression.7,8

Results
Effects of IGK and SSA on the APP Expression
IGK is
a RNA splicing inhibitor that arrests spliceosome assembly by retaining
pre-mRNA in complex A.7 SSA is another
potent RNA splicing inhibitor that targets the SF3b complex.8 We first treated HEK293T cells in triplicates
with IGK at the dose (30 μM) according to the effective concentration
in the report,7 using the solvent dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) as the control for 12 h. In the result of the western
blot, the IGK treatment showed a substantial increase of APP
expression as compared to the control treatment (Figure 1A). Quantitative analysis of
the results from more experiments confirmed the difference between
IGK and the control treatments with statistical significance (Student’s t-test, P < 0.05). However, in the SSA
treatment (25 nM, HEK293T, for 6 h), the APP expression was largely
inhibited and all three independent experiments yielded the similar
results (Figure 1B).
On the basis of these results, it suggests that the effects of RNA
splicing inhibition on the APP expression are not universally consistent.
Therefore, the modulation of the APP expression by U1 snRNP inhibition
might be unique to itself.

Figure 1 Effects of two chemical RNA splicing inhibitors
on the APP expression.
(A) Isoginkgetin (IGK) increases the APP expression. HEK293T cells
were treated in triplicates with 30 μM IGK for 12 h. (B) Spliceostatin
A (SSA) inhibits the APP expression. HEK293T cells were treated in
triplicates with 25 nM for 6 h. As a solvent of these two chemicals,
DMSO was used as the control. Protein relative abundance was derived
from the blot intensities quantified by ImageJ and then normalized
to the average of the controls. Data were from three independent experiments
in both IGK and SSA treatments. Error bars are S.E.M., Student’s t-tests, *P < 0.05.

Analysis of APP and RNA Under IGK Treatment
The effect
of IGK on the APP expression was intriguing. Because HEK293T is a
human kidney cell line, whereas APP/Aβ pathology is mainly related
to brain neurons, we therefore repeated the IGK treatment on the SK-N-SH
neuroblastoma cells. In the results, both HEK293T and SK-N-SH cells
demonstrated remarkable increase of the APP expression in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2A),
indicating that the effect of IGK also likely remains on neurons.

of APP RNA and protein expression induced by IGK. (A)

cells treated by IGK at different doses. (B) Schematic diagram of
three major APP RNA transcripts (770, 751, and 695). (C) Western blot
to show APP form change in IGK treatment. Samples were from HEK293T
cell lysates. The loading amount of IGK samples was serially reduced
so that the APP expression level is close to that of the DMSO control
for clearer protein pattern comparison. Proteins on the membrane after
electrotransfer during western blotting were stained by Ponceau S.
(D) RT-PCR of APP mRNA in IGK treatment. Forward primer targets exon
6 and the reverse primer targets exon 9. All samples received the
same RT-PCR protocol. After 25 amplification cycles, the DNA products
of each sample were taken for separation and visualization on the
1% agarose gel. This was repeated every three cycles until the DNA
bands started to be visible, so that the difference in their relative
abundance would not diminish due to over amplification. The results
shown were from PCR after 31 cycles.

At the mRNA level, APP has three major transcripts: APP770,
APP751,
and APP695, which differ in the inclusion of their exons 7 and 8 (Figure 2A).9 At the protein level, APP has three major forms expressed
by these mRNA transcripts with posttranslational modifications. The
newly synthesized protein APP in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is “immature”
and will move to Golgi for full glycosylation to become “mature”.10 On the western blot, APP usually appears in
three major protein bands: the immature form of APP695 at the bottom,
the mixture of mature APP695 and immature APP751/770 in the middle,
and the mature APP751 and APP770 on the top.9

In the IGK treatment, the bottom band remained unshifted but
the
top and the middle APP bands were replaced with an extra band occurring
between them (Figure 2C), suggesting a new protein isoform or distinct modifications. We
therefore performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using primers targeting the region between exons 6 and 9
to differentiate the three transcripts. We found that the expression
of APP770 was reduced and APP695 was increased, consistent with the
effect of IGK as a RNA splicing regulator. However, the total APP
RNA level, according to the relative intensities of the three transcript
bands resolved on the 1% agarose gel, was not obviously changed. This
indicates that the increased APP expression induced by IGK is not
directly due to the upregulated mRNA level. Because there seemed no
other novel transcripts and all of the three transcripts were still
abundant, the APP form change induced by IGK could not be explained
by the mechanism of transcript isoform switch.

IGK Inhibits the APP Degradation
Process
As a membrane
protein, APP is first synthesized in the ER and then transported to
Golgi for further processing prior to sorting to the cell membrane.11 When activated, the membrane APP is endocytosed
until finally proteolyzed or recycled back into the Golgi (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 Effect of IGK on APP
is likely through the blockage of protein
degradation. (A) Schematic diagram of APP intracellular traffic. Newly
synthesized APP from ER is transported to Golgi for processing and
sorting to the cell membrane. APP on the cell surface will then be
endocytosed or recycled back into Golgi. (B) Protein translation inhibition
abolished the IGK’s APP-increasing effect. HEK293T cells were
treated with IGK in the presence or absence of 20 μg/mL CHX
(a translation inhibitor). (C) Effects of proteasome and lysosome
inhibitors on APP degradation. HEK293T cells were first treated by
IGK for 9 h to accumulate APP, and then IGK was replaced with the
indicated chemicals for 12 h. MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, 100
μM; Baf A1, bafilomycin A1, a lysosome inhibitor that prevents
acidification, 0.2 μM. IGK, 30 μM. Ponceau S staining
of membrane was used for the demonstration of protein sample loading.

We first determined whether the
effect of IGK on the APP expression
is through protein synthesis using the protein translation inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX). In the experiment, CHX (20 μg/mL) almost
completely abolished the APP expression in both the DMSO control and
the IGK treatment at different doses (Figure 3B), indicating that the effect of IGK relies
on the protein synthesis.

We then examined whether the APP degradation
was involved in the
effect of IGK. Cells were first treated with 30 μM IGK for 9
h to accumulate sufficient amount of APP, and then the culture medium
was refreshed with the addition of 20 μg/mL CHX in combination
with other individual chemicals, including 100 μM MG-132 (a
proteasome inhibitor), 0.2 μM bafilomycin A1 (a lysosome inhibitor),
30 μM IGK, or DMSO control. By western blotting, we found that
the accumulated APP disappeared in about 3 h in the control, whereas
MG-132 and bafilomycin A1 slowed down this degradation process. IGK
similarly reduced the APP degradation with the demonstration of enhanced
efficiency (Figure 3C), suggesting additional or other distinct mechanisms being involved.
These imply that IGK increases APP possibly through the inhibition
of APP degradation.

IGK Regulates APP Subcellular Traffic
To see the intracellular
distribution of APP within cells under the IGK treatment, we treated
SK-N-SH cells with IGK (30 μM) for 6 h and performed double
fluorescent immunocytochemistry, using a specific APP antibody (Y188)12 and other antibodies that target Golgi (GM130),13 ER (KDEL),14 early
endosome (EEA1), and late endosome (M6PR).12 In the control, APP appeared to be localized in the Golgi with diffusive
distribution in the ER, the early and the late endosomes (Figure 4). This is consistent
with the APP subcellular distribution and traffic normally (Figure 3A).11,15 However, when the cells were treated with IGK, the APP became mainly
colocalized with the ER staining, suggesting its redistribution from
Golgi to ER.

Figure 4 Subcellular redistribution of APP under IGK treatment.
APP is likely
retained in the ER by IGK. SK-N-SH cells were used. Antibodies: anti-APP
(Y188), anti-GM130 (Golgi marker), anti-KDEL (ER marker), anti-M6PR
(mannose-6-phosphate receptor, late endosome marker), and anti-EEA1
(early endosome marker). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole: fluorescent
nucleus marker.

It seems that APP is
arrested by IGK in the ER where it starts
accumulating. This explains the remarkable increase of APPs and the
inhibition of their degradation under the IGK treatment. Because its
transport to the Golgi for glycosylation is blocked, the top band
of the mature APP form disappears on the western blot (Figure 2C). The over-accumulated APP
in the ER might receive excessive N-glycosylation and thus causes
the upward shift of the middle band (mainly immature APP751 and APP770)
on the western blot.

IGK Is Similar to Brefeldin A in the Effect
on the APP Expression
As IGK is suspected to prevent APP
traffic from ER to Golgi, we
compared it to the well-established ER-to-Golgi blocker brefeldin
A.16 IGK has an overall distinct structure
from brefeldin A but might bear some similar hydroxyl and other chemical
groups at certain local regions (Figure 5A). When we treated cells with these two
chemicals, a similar time-coursed APP expression pattern was elicited
(Figure 5B), suggesting
that IGK might have a similar effect of brefeldin A.

traffic blocker. (A) Chemical structures of isoginkgetin and brefeldin

Discussion
In
this study, we investigated the effects of RNA splicing inhibition
by IGK and SSA on the APP expression, and they showed diverse results.
We also found a unique function of IGK besides its function of RNA
splicing inhibition.

The effects of IGK and SSA on the APP expression
that we observed
in this study are distinct from that of U1 snRNP inhibition. Unlike
U1-70K knockdown, SSA inhibited the APP expression directly. Although
IGK increased the APP expression, the protein level and forms seemed
clearly different from those demonstrated in the U1 inhibition.4 These suggest that the effect of U1 inhibition
on the APP expression is unique and thus cannot be extended as a universal
result of all general RNA splicing inhibitions. This is consistent
with the fact that U1 alteration and APP pathology are unique to AD.

The mechanism of IGK in regulating protein ER-to-Golgi traffic
remains unclear. It might act through RNA regulation to downregulate
the proteins that are involved in this traffic, such as ADP-ribosylation
factors or the protein targets of brefeldin A.17,18 Regardless of the mechanism, it is reasonable to believe that this
effect also remains on other membrane proteins. This might be another
mode of action of IGK besides its function of RNA splicing inhibition
as an anticancer drug.19−21

Methods
Cell Culture and Treatment
HEK293T and SK-N-SH cells
were cultured in the Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(11965-092, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and antibiotics that included 100 units/mL penicillin and 100
μg/mL streptomycin (15140-122, Life Technologies). Cells were
maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator
and subcultured at 20–30% confluent density.

In RNA splicing
inhibition experiments, cells were plated at ∼40% confluent
density and then cultured for 24 h before the addition of chemicals.
IGK was purchased (416154, Merck Millipore). Chemicals used in other
experiments were CHX (239764, Calbiochem), bafilomycin A1 (B1793,
Sigma-Aldrich), MG-132 (1748, Boston Biochem), and brefeldin A (9972S,
Cell Signaling Technology).

Western Blotting
In western blotting,
cells were lysed
in the radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4,
100 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
1% Triton X-100) with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (11697498001,
Roche). The protein concentration in each sample was quantified by
the bicinchoninic acid assay. Sample proteins were separated by NuPAGE
4–12% Bis–Tris precast gels (Life Technologies) or self-made
Tris–glycine gels and then transferred to the nitrocellulose
membrane (0.2 μm pore size, 162-0112, Bio-Rad). Proteins on
the membrane were stained by Ponceau S (6226-79-5, Sigma-Aldrich)
to examine the success of electrotransfer and sample loading equality.
The membrane was then blocked by 5% nonfat milk in 1× Tris-buffered
saline-Tween 20 (TBST; 50 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl,
0.05% Tween-20) for about 15 min and then incubated with primary antibodies
in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1× TBST for 2 h or overnight.
The membrane was then washed by 1× TBST and further incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in 2.5%
milk. The chemical substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, 34087, Thermo
Scientific) was used to develop signals on films.

Immunocytochemistry
Cells were grown on coverslips
coated by poly-d-lysine (for HEK293T cells) or by collagen
(for SK-N-SH cells). They were washed by phosphate-buffered saline
and then fixed by 4% perfluoroalkoxy alkane (30525-89-4, Electron
Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min. After that, the cells were permeabilized
by 0.25% Triton X-100 in 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS) before
being blocked in 10% normal goat serum (50-062Z, Life Technologies)
for 30 min. After that, the coverslips were incubated with antibodies
in 1% BSA in TBS with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 2 h or overnight at room
temperature. After washing with 1× TBS with 0.01% Triton X-100,
the fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies were added. Images were
taken on the fluorescent microscope Nikon E800 or the confocal Zeiss
LSM 780.

Antibodies
Antibodies used in this study included:
anti-APP (22C11, MAB348, Merck Millipore and Y188, 1565-1, Epitomics),
anti-KDEL (10C3, ab12223, Abcam), anti-GM130 (ab52649, Abcam), anti-M6PR
(ab2733, Abcam), anti-EEA1 (ab70521, Abcam), and anti-β tubulin
(E7, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank).

RT-PCR
The RNA
was extracted from HEK293T cells using
an RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen) and synthesized into the first
DNA strand by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (18080-051, Life
Technologies). PCR was done by Choice Taq Mastermix (CB4070-8, Denville
Scientific). The forward primer that targeted APP exon 6 was “GACAAGTGCAAATTCTTACACCAG”;
and the reverse primer targeting APP exon 9 was “AGCGGGAGATCATTGCTCGG”.
