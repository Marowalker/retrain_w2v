The
handcrafted fabrication of a pyramidal mold on a silicon wafer
for nanopatterning was investigated. This process started with the
manual delivery of an aqueous glycerol solution onto the SiO2/Si wafer using a micropipette and subsequent drying to form a hemisphere
whose diameter is in the range of hundreds of micrometers. A coating
of polystyrene (PS) onto this wafer generates a circular hole caused
by dewetting. Subsequently, anisotropic wet-etching with the PS film
as a mask produces a pyramidal trench, whose apex approaches hundreds
of nanometers. Various elastomeric materials were casted into this
pyramidal mold. A pyramidal tip mounted on a simple micropositioner
was used for electrochemistry and patterning of a protein. First,
an agarose hydrogel was cast with a hydrogel pen for the electrochemical
reaction (HYPER). The redox reaction at the HYPER–electrode
interface demonstrated the characteristics of an ultramicroelectrode
or bulk electrode based on the contact area. Second, the pyramidal
polydimethylsiloxane served as a polymer pen for the contact printing
of silane on a glass substrate. After the successive immobilization
of biotin and avidin with fluorescence labeling, the resulting fluorescence
image demonstrated the successful patterning of the protein. This
new process for the creation of a pyramidal mold, referred to as a
“do-it-yourself” process, offers advantages to nonspecialists
in nanotechnology compared to conventional lithography, specifically
simplicity, rapidity, and low cost.

Introduction
Advances in nanotechnology
have enabled numerous studies of diverse,
small, and complex structures in various fields, leading to nanostructures
with chemical functionalities.1,2 In spite of the development
of highly precise state-of-the-art lithography tools such as deep
ultraviolet3 and electron beam lithography,4 nanofabrication remains a challenging task for
chemists, materials scientists, and biologists, because it requires
expensive, complex, and time-consuming processes. There are few methods
as alternatives. One is soft lithography based on an elastomeric stamps5 and another is the scanning probe-based technique.6,7 Soft lithography enables the rapid prototyping of both microscale
and sub-microscale structures through the transfer of molecules to
the surface of a substrate using an elastomeric stamp,8 providing the rapid pattern formation over a large area
by parallel printing. During this process, a predefined mold for the
stamp defines the printed structures of the nanostructures. In contrast,
scanning probe-based techniques such as dip-pen lithography are direct-draw
methods for delivering/removing molecules from surfaces.7,9 In theory, these methods can be used to fabricate arbitrary nanostructures
on a surface using a single probe with a micropyramidal structure
with an extremely sharp apex. To achieve parallel printing for mass
production, polymer pen lithography, introduced by the Mirkin group,
is based on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp consisting of an array
of the pyramids (∼11 000 000 pens per array).10 The array allows the high-throughput and large-scale
patterning while retaining the capability of arbitrary pattern formation,
though leveling problems must be considered for high quality over
a large area.11 The pyramidal structure
of an elastic material is also a significant technique for nanoscience.
Our group reported a hydrogel pen for electrochemical reactions (HYPER),
in which a pyramidal-shaped hydrogel containing an electrolyte offers
an electroactive area on the nanometer scale through contact on an
electrode for 3D printing by electrodeposition.12 HYPER can also be applied to a sensing platform with various
chemical reactions.13 A master or mold
for the pyramidal shape, however, still requires complex procedures,
including CAD design, mask fabrication, and photolithography steps,8 which are not familiar in chemical and biological
laboratory environments. If one can fabricate a handcrafted pyramidal
mold using typical laboratory items such as a micropipette and produce
a handmade nanostructure with a pyramidal tip and a stepper, such
a “do-it-yourself (DIY)” manufacturing process may reduce
the costs, energy use, time, and complexity of the creation of a pyramidal
mold, thus enabling more open access to nanoscience.

A pyramidal-shaped
stamp has a sharp tip smaller than a micrometer,
while the diameter at the base becomes approximately several hundred
micrometers. A pyramidal hole on the surface can be achieved by the
anisotropic etching of a silicon wafer with a resist film containing
circular holes of hundreds of micrometers as a mask, this is feasible
through a handcrafted procedure with conventional laboratory tools.
A commercially available micropipette can deliver small amounts of
liquid in volumes as low as 0.2 μL. The diameter of the residue
after the evaporation of the solvent shrink drastically depending
on various parameters, such as the concentration of the solute and
the surface properties.14 Glycerol is typically
added to inks for the printing of biomaterials and electronics owing
to its low vapor pressure and hygroscopic properties.15,16 Reports of the fabrication of an array consisting of glycerol by
atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrated that glycerol is relatively
stable with regard to evaporation.17 Thus,
residual glycerol after water evaporation offers a smaller hemisphere.
This hemispheric glycerol can be transferred to the circular holes
in polymer films due to the immiscibility between the hydrophilic
glycerol and a hydrophobic solvent of the polymer, such as water in
a breath figure18 or polyethylene glycol19 can serve as the sacrificial templates for the
patterning of polymer films.

Herein, we report a handcrafted
pyramidal mold, the fabrication
of a pyramidal stamp, and the application of these items to create
a handmade nanostructure. Our method is based on the manual formation
of ten holes in polymer films on silicon oxide using a micropipette,
which served here as a mask for the wet anisotropic etching of silicon
in a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution. The single polymer
structure molded from this template can serve as a polymer pen for
both nanoscale electrochemistry and the patterning of biomaterials
with the aid of a USB microscope and a micropositioner. Thus, many
scientists can access nanoscience on their own using a pyramidal shape
in the absence of cumbersome steps such as CAD designing, photolithography,
and/or vacuum coating/etching, given the advantages of the rapid prototyping
and mask-free arbitrary patterning for various research purposes.

Results
and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows the
process by which the handcrafted mold and pyramidal structure were
created. First, the surface of the commercial SiO2/Si wafer
undergoes a treatment with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to make it
hydrophobic. Then, 0.2 μL of a 0.2% (w/w) glycerol aqueous solution
is delivered onto this hydrophobic HMDS surface of the silicon wafer
(SiO2/Si) by a pipette. The average diameter of the hemispherical
drops is 0.84 mm (n = 3). After the evaporation of
water in a chamber connected to a pump for 10 min, the residual glycerol
forms a quasi-hemisphere of around one hundred micrometer in diameter.
Although the sizes of the glycerol patterns are determined by the
volume and concentration of the glycerol solution (Figures S1 and S2), we fixed these parameters. The HMDS treatment
enhances the hemispherical shape of glycerol during the evaporation
step. Simple dropping of 60 μL of a 2% (w/w) polystyrene (PS)/toluene
solution onto the substrate wets the surface, except for the hydrophilic
area of hemispherical glycerol. In this way, a stable PS film is formed
after the toluene dries completely. Subsequently, the glycerol is
removed by washing with water and quasi-circular holes in the PS film
are formed. During the subsequent etching of SiO2 in a
HF aqueous solution for 150 s, a PS film with circular holes serves
as a mask for the transferring of the circular pattern into a SiO2 layer. The next anisotropic etching step in a 25% (w/w) TMAH
aqueous solution (80 °C for 5 h) creates pyramidal holes under
the circle opening of the SiO2 layer. Scheme 1b shows the method used to
fabricate the pyramidal structure. The prepolymer is poured into the
mold. After curing, the pyramidal structure is peeled off manually.

Scheme 1 Procedures for Handcrafting the Pyramidal Mold
(a)
Glycerol acts as a sacrificial
template for the micrometer-scale hole on PS films. Wet-etching through
this hole creates the pyramidal vertex with a nanoscale inside the
silicon wafer, which is served as the template for the pyramidal shape.
The photo in the solid box shows the manufactured pyramidal mold and
the six red circles indicate successful etched holes. (b) Fabrication
of a single pyramidal structure using the pyramidal mold.

Figure 1 presents
optical images of each fabrication step. Figure 1a shows an optical image of residual glycerol
on a SiO2/Si wafer after the delivery of 0.2 μL of
a 0.2% (w/w) glycerol aqueous solution followed by evaporation in
a vacuum chamber for 10 min and the dropping of the PS solution onto
the substrate surface. The shape of the residual glycerol is mainly
circular with a diameter of ca. 132 μm on average [n = 6, standard deviation (SD) = 13.34]. The size can be controlled
according to the weight percentage of glycerol (Figures S1 and S3). It is also important to note that only
six cases of the ten trials produce these successful circular residues,
which determine the sharpness of the pyramidal mold. To guarantee
a circular residue outcome for a sharp tip of the pyramid, several
drops of glycerol solution were delivered with an appropriate pitch
over a piece of the silicon wafer 1 cm × 2 cm in size. Specifically,
a larger number of trials with various drops on one piece of Si can
create a successful circular shape even with a ca. 60% yield without
any expensive and complex instruments as shown in Figure S2. It should be mentioned that one mold of a good
pyramid can be reusable as the template for the polymeric pyramid.
The subsequent removal of glycerol with water produces the circular
hole on the substrate shown in the optical image in Figure 1b. The PS film serves as a
resistive mask for the HF solution, transferring the hole pattern
onto the wafer (Figure 1c). Next, silicon was anisotropically etched into a 25% (w/w) TMAH
aqueous solution at 80 °C. Figure 1d shows the truncated pyramid structure in the middle
of the etching process. At the end of the anisotropic etching step,
an optical image of the pyramid demonstrates the vanishing point (Figure 1e), whereas a SEM
image shows a clear pyramidal shape (Figure 1f). The base size of the patterns is a key
factor for determining the etching time. Under these conditions, the
average base length is ca. 150 μm (n = 6, SD
= 12.79). From scanning electron microscopy, the lateral size of the
sharp tip of the pyramidal tip is typically on the micrometer scale
(Figure 1f, inset).
Thus, one can obtain a sharp tip of an average size of 2.62 μm
(n = 6, SD = 2.15) by the simple delivery of a glycerol
solution with several wet chemistry steps.

etching for 5 h. The inset shows the zoomed in image of the sharp
tip.

For electrochemistry, the pyramidal
agarose gel tip was prepared
by immersing the pyramidal mold into a hot agarose sol. The pyramidal
agarose gel, referred to as HYPER, was used for localized electrochemistry,
demonstrating the potential for nanoscale electrochemistry, though
other polymeric pens can be fabricated by the mold (Figure S4). Figure 2a shows the successful fabrication of HYPER (base length of
ca. 128 μm and height of ca. 90 μm). These hydrogels can
contain various electrolytes in their 3D polymeric structure.20 After soaking HYPER in an electroactive solution
containing 1 mM FcMeOH in 0.103 M KClO4, the pyramidal
tip was mounted onto a micropositioning system to control the contact
area with the working electrode, as shown in Figure 2b. The Au working electrode was brought into
close proximity to the end of the tip from above the tip, while a
potentiostat with a three-electrode configuration was connected. For
localized electrochemistry, the contact area is defined by the position
of the tip on the z-axis, and two USB cameras were
used with the coarse approach between HYPER and Au. With the sufficiently
positive potential of the Au working electrode for the oxidation of
FcMeOH, the Au electrode is moved closer to HYPER in micrometer steps.
When the apex came into contact with Au, the anodic current abruptly
increased in the chronoamperometry (CA) curve (Figure 2c). At this time, the anodic current is a
mixture of the charging current to the electrical double layer (EDL)
between the ionic electrolyte and the conducting working electrode
and the faradaic current of the oxidation of FcMeOH caused by the
formation of the EDL. The charging current disappears very quickly
and then only the faradic process governs the anodic current. Note
that the current appears to be constant, independent of time. This
behavior deviated from the well-known Cottrell equation and is a representative
characteristic of the nanoscale contact, indicating the enhanced mass
transportation of FcMeOH similar to the well-known radial diffusion
of an ultramicroelectrode (UME).12 With
every increase of the contact area upon an increase of 1 μm
in the z-position, similar behaviors were observed,
except for the raised anodic currents demonstrating the successful
fabrication of the pyramidal shape. Assuming that the vertex of agarose
is sharp, the main factor for determining the current value and cyclic
voltammogram (CV) shape is not the size of the agarose base (b) but the deformation length (d) as long
as d ≪ b condition, according
to the previous HYPER.12 Brief introduction
for HYPER is shown in Figure S5. Figure 2d shows CVs with
the contact position between the gel tip and the working electrode.
Upon first contact, the CV presented a sigmoidal shape, similar to
a UME. Assuming that the contact area is a simple square, the side
length of the square is ca. 1.41 μm. When the contact area becomes
larger (20 μm compressed length), the CV indicates a general
diffusion-controlled system. The pyramidal shape cannot offer complete
radial diffusion, but the tilted sidewalls contributed to enhanced
diffusion until the end of the diffusion layer arrived at the base
of the pyramid. A larger contact area with a lower height to the base
changes the diffusion from a radial-like process to typical linear
diffusion. These electrochemical experiments clearly demonstrate that
HYPER created by the handcrafted mold offers a simple and inexpensive
means of realizing sub-micrometer-scale contact down to hundreds of
nanometers.

(red) and 20 μm (black) compressed lengths (scan rate: 50 mV/s).

This concept can be applied to other nanotechnologies,
such as
the pattern formation of small molecules and biomaterials on the substrates
created by the pyramidal PDMS. This pyramidal PDMS tip was inked with
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and then printed onto a glass
substrate, demonstrating the ability of this method to fabricate nanostructures.
The pyramidal tip was mounted on a conventional analytical balance
after the inking of the tip with an ethanol solution containing 1%
(v/v) APTES (Figure 3a). A balance acted as a sensing element to detect the contact between
the pyramidal PDMS and the glass substrate. Next, the glass substrate
mounted on a micropositioner was brought into contact with the pyramidal
PDMS. For the controlled fabrication of the nanostructure, two parameters
should be considered. The first is the contact area between PDMS and
the glass substrate, which defines the pattern size. The second is
the dwell time, which influences the dot size by the lateral diffusion
of the ink. We assumed that the former is the only parameter of importance
here because the effect of the dwell time is not dominant in microcontact
printing under an ambient environment. Two complementary techniques
control the contact diameter. First, the USB camera offers a vision
system to determine the distance and the contact/detachment between
the tip and the substrate. In a commercial AFM system, the vision
system is mounted on the top of a tip cantilever whose focal plane
is synchronized with the movement of a nanopositioner on the z-axis. A micropositioner, however, is difficult to implement
for such a complex function. Specifically, this type of a vision system
provides only rough information pertaining to contact/detachment.
To control the diameter of the contact area, we used the detection
of the pressure (4–6 mg weight change) by a conventional analytical
balance caused by the contact. This method is not as precise as a
state-of-the-art and commercial scanning probe microscope system in
terms of the contact area. The microscale feature sizes, however,
were successfully generated at approximately the micrometer scale,
making them sufficient for chemical or biological applications such
as arrays of molecules. For example, a sulfo-NHS-biotin/dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) solution was dropped onto the substrate patterned with APTES
for biotinylation. The NHS-activated biotin was conjugated with the
amine functional group of APTES on the glass. A streptavidin–fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) complex was then selectively bound to biotin
by means of strong avidin–biotin interaction. A 2 × 2
array of avidin proteins was printed. A fluorescence image from the
FITC dyes shows the successful fabrication of dots (Figure 3b). The diameter of each dot
is approximately 10 μm with a spacing distance of 65 μm,
indicating sufficient control of the contact area from the analytical
balance. This result demonstrates that a micrometer-scale pattern
array of biomolecules can be fabricated using a DIY pyramidal mold,
a micropositioner, a USB camera, and an analytical balance without
any other special apparatuses. This manuscript focused on the fabrication
of a DIY pyramidal mold and its application for HYPER and the array
of biomolecules within a small area. The patterning for a large area
is out of the scope because it requires more complex and expensive
instrument. At this stage, we may suggest that the pyramidal array
of PDMS will be useful,10 which can be
fabricated by our single pyramidal tip.21

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we demonstrated the successful fabrication of a
pyramidal mold by the handcrafted delivery of a glycerol solution
onto a Si wafer and a subsequent anisotropic etching step. The hydrogel
molded from this template is suitable for nanoelectrochemistry processes
(e.g., HYPER) upon the introduction of an electrolyte inside of it.
A protein array on the micrometer scale was also patterned on a glass
substrate by means of a pyramidal PDMS process with ink. In addition
to the simple fabrication process, that is, a “DIY”
process, both hydrogel electrochemistry and contact printing were
successfully utilized with the simple aid of two USB cameras and a
conventional analytical balance. We believe that this approach will
allow nonspecialists or scientists in developing countries an easy
access to nanotechnology for their research.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of the Pyramidal Mold
A SiO2/Si wafer (thickness
of silicon oxide: 500 nm) was cut into 1 cm
× 2 cm pieces with a diamond knife. The pieces were cleaned in
a piranha solution (3:1 mixture of H2SO4 and
30% H2O2, v/v) for 2 min and rinsed with deionized
water (DI). The wafer was then coated with a vapor of HMDS in a vacuum
desiccator for 20 min. Subsequently, 0.2 μL of a 0.2% (w/w)
glycerol solution was placed on the modified wafer using a micropipette
(Eppendorf, 2.5 μL), and the wafer was dried in a vacuum chamber
for 10 min. Next, 60 μL of a 2% (w/w) PS (average Mw: 192 000)/toluene solution was dropped onto the
wafer patterned with glycerol, with a subsequent drying step for 30
min. The circle patterns on the wafer were generated by the washing
away of the glycerol with distilled water (DI) for 10 s. The exposed
SiO2 layer through the circle patterns was removed in a
1:10 (v/v) HF/DI solution for 150 s and rinsed with DI. The wafer
was placed into a tube (15 ml, Falcon) with 5 mL of TMAH (25% w/w)
aqueous solution and incubated in an 80 °C water bath under vigorous
stirring for 5 h. For stirring, the tube was fixed on a clamp connected
to a vortex machine (Scientific Industries, Genie 2). A needle was
fixed onto a lid of the tube for degassing during the etching process.
All optical images were obtained using a microscope (OLYMPUS, IX71).

Preparation of the Agarose Gel and Procedure for Hydrogel Electrochemistry
An agarose powder was mixed with DI (1:14, w/w) and incubated in
a 90 °C water bath to dissolve the gel. Bubbles of the agarose
sol were removed through a repeated process in a microwave oven for
few seconds followed by incubation in a water bath. After degassing,
the mold for the pyramidal structure was put into the agarose sol.
The agarose sol was allowed to cool at room temperature for complete
polymerization and was then peeled from the mold. The parts of the
gel around the pyramid structure were cut for easy contact. The pyramidal
gel was soaked in 1 mM ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) and 0.103 M KClO4 solution for more than 4 h. The gel was fixed on a Petri
dish containing an electrolyte, Ag/AgCl as a reference, and a Pt counter
electrode. The Petri dish was placed on the metal plate of the micropositioner.
Additionally, an Au working electrode was fixed on a stepper motor.
The two potentiostats (CHI 900B) were employed: one for electrochemistry
and the other to control the stepper. The working electrode was controlled
in a downward direction to reach the agarose pyramidal tip while two
USB cameras were used to observe the process (Dino-Lite, AD7013MTL).
As soon as contact occurred between the Au electrode and the gel,
a current signal was generated from zero to the nanoampere scale.
At this point, the working electrode approached the pyramidal gel
at a rate of 1 μm per 5 s.

Patterning of a Biomaterial
on a Glass Substrate
The
PDMS base was mixed with a curing agent at a 10:1 weight ratio with
the subsequent removal of bubbles in a vacuum chamber for 30 min.
Before molding, the pyramidal mold was coated with trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane in a vacuum desiccator for 20 min to prevent
adhesion to PDMS (Sylgard 184). The PDMS prepolymer was poured into
the pyramidal mold and cured for 2 h in an oven at 65 °C. The
cured PDMS was then manually peeled from the mold. The periphery of
the pyramid was cut with a blade for easy contact. A glass substrate
was cleaned with a piranha solution for 20 min. Both PDMS and the
glass underwent an O2 plasma treatment for 2 min (Femto
Science, 100 W). The activated pyramidal tip was inked with 1% (v/v)
APTES in an ethanol solution for 10 s and the residual solution was
dried under blown N2. The activated glass was fixed at
a stepper and controlled downward using the CHI 900B potentiostat
program on a micrometer scale. At this point, the analytical balance
(A&D COMPANY, HF-200) and two USB cameras were used to recognize
the contact between the glass and PDMS. The dwell time was within
10 s. The substrate patterned with APTES was incubated in 5 mg/mL
sulfo-NHS-biotin in DMSO for 30 min and washed with DMSO and water
to remove excessive biotin from the surface. The biotinylated substrate
was then incubated in 0.1 mg/mL streptavidin–FITC in phosphate
buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) for 30 min to form an avidin–biotin
system and then washed with water to remove any unbound avidin.
