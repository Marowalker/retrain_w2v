The reaction of 2-methoxy-6-[{2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino}methyl]
phenol (LH3) with lanthanide metal salts followed by the
addition of nickel acetate allowed isolation of a family of octanuclear
complexes, [Ni4Ln4(μ2-OH)2(μ3-OH)4(μ-OOCCH3)8(LH2)4]·(OH)2·xH2O. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies
of these complexes reveal that their central metallic core consists
of two tetranuclear [Ni2Ln2O4] cubane
subunits fused together by acetate and hydroxide bridges. The magnetic
study of these complexes reveals a ferromagnetic interaction between
the LnIII and the NiII center. The magnitude
of exchange coupling between the NiII and LnIII center, parametrized from the magnetic data of the Gd analogue,
gives J = +0.86 cm–1. The magneto
caloric effect, studied for the NiII4GdIII4 complex, shows a maximum of magnetic entropy
change, −ΔSm = 22.58 J kg–1 K–1 at 3 K for an applied external
field of 5 T.

Introduction
The discovery of single-molecule
magnets (SMMs) is now nearly 2
decade old, yet this field continues to grow unabated with several
contributions each year. The first example of a SMM is a Mn12 complex, and this spurred interest in polynuclear transition metal
complexes.1−5 The cumulative understanding as a result of studies on several such
complexes leads to the understanding that in polynuclear transition
metal complexes a high spin ground state (S) and
a negative magnetic anisotropy (D) should be present
to achieve high anisotropic energy barriers (Ueff) for magnetization reversal.6−8 Although a large spin
ground state can be achieved in exchange-coupled polynuclear transition
metal complexes, the S and D parameters
are found to be inversely proportional to each other and therefore
there appears to be a limit to the extent of increasing Ueff by modulating S.9−13 It was soon realized that the single-ion anisotropies,
particularly of lanthanide ions might be gainfully harnessed for achieving
interesting magnetic properties in molecular complexes.14−18 One of the approaches to take advantage of the lanthanide anisotropy
is to design molecular magnets containing heterometallic 3d/4f complexes.19−24 We have been working in assembling and studying various types of
3d/4f complexes.25−27 Among the numerous 3d/4f complexes reported in the
literature, including from our laboratory, polynuclear NiII/LnIII complexes are gaining interest because of the ferromagnetic
exchange interaction that is often seen between the lanthanide and
nickel center.28−32 In view of this interest, we were interested in exploring new NiII/LnIII complexes. In an earlier study from our
laboratory, we have used the 2-methoxy-6-[{2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino}methyl]phenol
(LH3) ligand to assemble the heterometallic FeIII/LnIII and CoIII2LnIII complexes.33−35 The latter was found to be an SMM even at zero applied
magnetic field with the highest reversal of energy barrier so far
reported in the literature for such type of complexes.34 It was of interest to us to study the coordination
behavior of LH3 toward the assembly of NiII/LnIII complexes. Accordingly, herein, we report a series of Ni4Ln4 complexes (Ln = Y, (1); Gd, (2); Tb, (3); Dy, (4); Er, (5); Ho, (6)). These complexes are composed of
two heterometallic NiII2LnIII2O4 distorted cubes connected to each other by acetate
and hydroxide bridging ligands. The synthesis, characterization, and
magnetism of these complexes are discussed herein.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic
Aspects
Polyfunctional compartmental ligands
with O-donor and N-donor atoms are the most commonly used ligands
for the construction of heterometallic 3d/4f complexes, many of which
exhibit interesting magnetic properties.36−39 Appropriate design of ligands
with specific binding compartments that can selectively coordinate
to lanthanide and transition metal ions allows the preparation of
3d/4f heterometallic compounds. We have been involved in the design
of such ligands for some time and have successfully assembled many
3d/4f complexes. In this context, we have prepared a multipocket compartmental
Schiff base ligand based on an ethylenediamine central motif flanked
by two unsymmetrical O-donor functional units. Previously, we have
used this ligand to prepare a Co2Dy complex which revealed
a zero-field SMM behavior.34 In view of
this, we were interested to explore if this ligand could be used for
preparing other heterometallic 3d/4f complexes containing NiII. Accordingly, the ligand 2-methoxy-6-{[2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino]methyl}phenol
(LH3) was allowed to react with nickel acetate and lanthanide
metal salts in the presence of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide in a
1:1.1:2 stoichiometric ratio to afford dicationic octanuclear complexes, 1–6 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ni4Ln4 Complexes
Molecular Structures
The molecular structures of the
complexes 1–6 were confirmed by single crystal
X-ray crystallography. The crystal data and refinement parameters
for 1–6 are summarized in Table 1. All the complexes are isostructural and
crystallized in the monoclinic crystal system with the P21/n space group. The asymmetric unit
of all these complexes contains one-half of the molecule (two mono-deprotonated
ligand [LH2]−, two lanthanide ions, two
nickel ions, four bridging acetate ions, and three bridging hydroxylato
ions) (see Figure 1a). This cationic asymmetric unit is charge-balanced by a hydroxide
ion hydrogen-bonded with the ligand periphery.

The coordination modes of all the participating ligands
in 1–6 are summarized in Supporting Information (see Figure S6). The nature of the bridging hydroxylato
ligand present in all the complexes has been confirmed by bond valence
sum (BVS) calculations (see Table S1; Supporting Information). In view of the overall structural similarity
of the complexes, the molecular structure of [Ni4Gd4(μ2-OH)2(μ3-OH)4(μ-OOCCH3)8(LH2)4]·(OH)2 (2) is described herein,
as a representative example, to illustrate the common structural features
of these complexes. The structural details of complexes 1 and 3–6 are given in the Supporting Information (see Figure S1–S5).

The
various aspects of the structural details of 2 are given
in Figure 1a–f.
The crystal structure of 2 reveals it to
be a dicationic complex, [Ni4Gd4(μ2-OH)2(μ3-OH)4(μ-OOCCH3)8(LH2)4]2+, containing
two counter hydroxide ions that are involved in a hydrogen-bonded
interaction with the complex. The structure of the complex can be
understood in the following way. The whole complex can be structurally
decomposed into two NiII2LnIII2 subunits, which are interconnected by hydroxide and acetate
bridges. Two [LH2]− units are involved
in binding and assembling the NiII2LnIII2 motifs. The two LnIIIs present in the sub
unit are bridged to each other by a pair of hydroxide ligands affording
a four-membered LnIII2O2 ring. Each
of the bridging OH groups is also involved in binding to a NiII. The phenolate unit of a [LH2]− is involved in bridging NiII and LnIII and
is also involved in interaction with an additional NiII. The imino nitrogen and the free NH of the ethylenediamine motif
are involved in a chelating coordination action to NiII. Interestingly, the N–CH2CH2OH unit
does not take part in coordination and is unutilized; however, the
OH group is involved in a hydrogen bonding to the counter hydroxide
ions (Figure 1a,b).
Each of the methoxy groups on the aromatic scaffold are involved in
a terminal coordination to the lanthanide ions. Finally, the two subunits
are linked to each other by a pair of hydroxide ligands and four acetate
ligands.

As a result of the cumulative coordination interaction
described
above, the complex contains two tetranuclear NiII2LnIII2O4 cubane cores (containing
μ2-acetate- and hydroxide ligands). As mentioned
above, the acetate ligands bridge the GdIII ions of two
different cubane cores in a syn–syn μ-η1:η1 fashion to form
the heterometallic octanuclear core. A perspective view of the octanuclear
core structure is shown in Figure 1c.

The GdIII ions are all equivalent
and have an 8O coordination
environment in a trigonal dodecahedron geometry as confirmed by SHAPE
analysis40 (Figure 1e; Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Three oxygen atoms of the 8O coordination environment
are from the bridging carboxylate groups (O2C, O2D, and O1E; Gd–O
average distance 2.359(4) Å), three from hydroxide ligands (O1H,
O2H, and O1G; Gd–O average distance 2.353(3) Å), and two
O atoms (Gd–O1B distance 2.581(3) Å and Gd–O2B
distance 2.482(3) Å) from the phenoxide motif of the ligand.

The NiII centers in the complex are equivalent and are
hexacoordinate (2N, 4O) in a distorted octahedral geometry (Table
S4 in the Supporting Information) with
the nitrogen atoms occupying the cis positions (Figure 1f). The coordination sphere consists of two
oxygen atoms from the phenolates of two different ligands (O2B and
O2A; Ni–O average distance 2.140(3) Å), one oxygen atom
from the hydroxide ligand (Ni–O1H distance 2.018(3) Å),
one oxygen atom from the acetate ligand (Ni–O2E distance 2.083(3)
Å), and two N atoms of the same ligand (N1B and N2B; average
distance 2.060(4) Å). The average Gd–Ooph–Ni
bond angle is 98.35(10)°, while the average Ni···Gd
separation is 3.502(6) Å. The dihedral angles in the bridging
fragment were obtained through mean plane analysis shown in Figure 1d. The dihedral angle
containing plane 1 (O2A–Gd2–O2H) and plane 2 (O2A–Ni1–O2H)
is 16.0°; however, a value of 21.1° is obtained when plane
3 and plane 4 were considered.

We have also checked the phase
purity of all the complexes (1–6) using powder
X-ray diffraction analysis (Figures
S8–S13 in the Supporting Information), which shows good agreement with the simulated patterns generated
from the SCXRD data. Analysis of the crystal packing diagram reveals
that the shortest distance between two LnIII centers of
the neighboring molecule is 9.714 Å (Figure S7).

Magnetic Properties
The temperature
dependence of the
χMT product for complexes 1–6 (χM being the molar magnetic susceptibility
per mononuclear NiII4LnIII4 unit) in the 2–300 K temperature range was measured with
an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T and is given in Figures 2 and 3 for complexes 1 and 2, respectively, and
in Figure 6 for complexes 3–6.

Figure 2 Temperature dependence of the χMT product and field dependence of magnetization for compound 1. The solid lines represent the best fit of the experimental
data.

Figure 3 Temperature dependence of the χMT product and field dependence of magnetization
for compound 2. The solid lines represent the best fit
of the experimental
data.

At room temperature, the observed
χMT values for 1–6 are close to those calculated
for four independent NiII and LnIII (YIII) ions in the free ion approximation (Table 2). We are going to start the discussion with
the Ni4Y4 (1) and Ni4Gd4 (2) complexes. On lowering the temperature,
the χMT slowly increases from room
temperature to 50 K (5.03 cm3 K mol–1) for 1 and 30 K (42.1 cm3 K mol–1) for 2 and then in a more abrupt way to reach values
of 5.88 cm3 K mol–1 at 10 K and 65.7
cm3 K mol–1 at 2 K, for 1 and 2, respectively. These behaviors are due to a ferromagnetic
interaction between the NiII ions in the case of 1 and between the NiII ions and the NiII and GdIII ions in the case of 2. In the
case of 1, the χMT decreases
below 10 K up to 2 K, which is probably associated with the zero-field
splitting effect of the NiII ions.

The magnetic properties of 1 have been modeled by
using the following Hamiltonian: 1  where J accounts for the
magnetic exchange coupling between NiII ions, Ja represents the magnetic exchange coupling between NiII ions through the shorter Ni1–Y3–Y3′–Ni1′
and Ni2–Y4–Y4′–Ni2′ pathways, and DNi accounts for the axial single ion zero-field
splitting parameter of the NiII ions, which are equivalent
(see Figure 4). The
simultaneous fit of the experimental susceptibility and magnetization
data with the above Hamiltonian using the PHI program41 afforded the following set of parameters: J = +5.2 cm–1, Ja =
−0.09 cm–1, g = 2.15, D = 5.6 cm–1, and R =
4.3 × 10–7. The very weak antiferromagnetic
(AF) interaction described by Ja must
be taken into account, because when Ja is fixed to zero the quality of the fit got rather worse.

Figure 4 Scheme of the
magnetic coupling pathways in complex 2.

The ferromagnetic coupling exhibited by complex 1 can
be justified by analyzing the structural parameters of dinuclear Ni2 complexes with the diphenoxido bridging group connecting
octahedral NiII ions. Experimental and theoretical magnetostructural
correlations42 have shown that the Ni–O–Ni
bridging angle (θ) is the major issue influencing the nature
of the magnetic coupling in hydroxido-, alkoxido-, and phenoxido-Ni(O)2Ni complexes. Thus, for Ni–O–Ni angles close
to 90°, a ferromagnetic coupling is expected. As the Ni–O–Ni
angle increases from 90°, the ferromagnetic coupling diminished
and becomes AF at values of ∼96–98°. Moreover,
it has been shown from theoretical studies42a that the AF interaction increases when τ (the out-of-plane
displacement of the phenyl carbon atom from the Ni2O2 plane) diminishes. Taking into account this, the Ni(O)2Ni diphenoxo-bridging fragment in complex 1,
with mean θ and τ angles of 98.6° and 46.7°
should transmit either weak F or AF interactions between the Ni2+ ions, which is in good agreement with the observed values.

The magnetic data for such an intricate as the Ni4Gd4 complex (2) were modeled in a crude manner with
the following Hamiltonian 2  where the interactions
between the GdIII and NiII ions connected by
two μ3-O bridging atoms of the two cubane units are
assumed to be equal, J″ represents the Gd–Gd
interactions inside
the cubane units, and zJ′ accounts for the
intercubane interactions between the GdIII using the molecular
field approach (see Figure 4). Taking into account that the structural parameters affecting
the dinuclear Ni2 units inside the cubane units are almost
identical for the isostructural complexes 1 and 2 and to avoid over-parametrization, the values of J and D were fixed to those extracted for
compound 1. Considering the above approximations, the
best fit of the magnetic data with the above Hamiltonian led to the
following magnetic parameters: J′ = 0.86 cm–1, J″ = −0.0034 cm–1, g = 2.10, zJ′
= −0.0002 cm–1, and R =
1.2 × 10–5.

Experimental and theoretical
studies on diphenoxide-bridged GdNi
dinuclear complexes43,44 have shown that the ferromagnetic
interaction between NiII and GdIII ions increases
mainly with the increase of the Ni–O–Gd angle (θ)
and with the planarity of the Ni–O2–Gd fragment.
Complex 2 has average values of the θ angle and
the hinge angle β (the dihedral angle between the O–Ni–O
and O–Gd–O planes in the bridging fragment) of 102.1°
and 18.6°, respectively. For these values and according to the
magnetostructural correlations, a JNiGd ≈ +1 cm–1 is expected, which agrees well
with the JNiGd′ value extracted for 2.
It is worth noting that the magnetic coupling constants for the Ni···Gd
and Gd···Gd intracubane interactions agree in sign
and magnitude with those found for other Ni2Gd2O4 cubane complexes.45 As the
GdIII ion has no first order angular momentum and almost
a negligible zero-field splitting, the dipolar interactions are expected
to be very weak, so that the experimentally observed Gd···Gd
interactions are due mainly to exchange coupling between the GdIII ions. Experimental and theoretical studies have
shown that for diphenoxo- and dialkoxo-, two oxo-carboxylate and two
carboxylate-acetate bridging groups seem to indicate that the smaller
values of the Gd–O–Gd, and consequently the Gd···Gd
distance, favor the AF interaction.46 For
some of these compounds, AF interactions are predicted for Gd–O–Gd
angles smaller than 110°. In view of the above considerations,
the fact that the intracubane AF interactions (described by J″) are larger than the intercubane ones (described
by zJ′) is not unexpected as the Gd–O–Gd
angles for the former are around 108.5°, whereas the Gd–O–Gd
angle for the latter ones is 132.23°. Taking into account only
the Gd–O–Gd angle, the intercubane interaction is expected
to be ferromagnetic in nature; however, the existence of two additional syn–syn acetate bridging groups
connecting the GdIII ions lead to the very weak AF interaction
found for this triple bridge. Nevertheless, these assumptions should
be taken with caution because of (i) the crudeness of the model, (ii)
the weakness of the magnetic interactions, and (iii) the possible
existence of ZFS splitting of the GdIII ions.

Previous
work has shown that NixGdy polynuclear complexes can exhibit large
magneto-caloric effects (MCE) and therefore can be considered for
magnetic refrigeration materials.47 This
is so because, among other factors, the magnetic exchange interaction
between the GdIII and NiII ions is very weak,
which generates multiple low-lying excited and field-accessible states,
each of which can contribute to the total magnetic entropy of the
system. Moreover, if the interaction is ferromagnetic in nature, the
low-lying states would have a large spin, which also favors a larger
MCE. In view of this, we decided to evaluate the MCE of 2 from magnetization measurements in the 2–6 K temperature
range under an applied magnetic field in the range 0–5 T, making
use of the Maxwell relation 3  where Bi and Bf are the initial and final applied magnetic
fields. The integration results show that the −ΔSm values for complex 2 under all
fields (Figure 5) increase
as the temperature decreases from 5 to 3 K, with a maximum magnetic
entropy change (−ΔSm = 22.58
J kg–1 K–1). This value is rather
smaller than the full magnetic entropy content per mole for the Ni4IIGd4III complex is 2R ln(2SGd + 1) + 2R ln(2SNi + 1) = 6.08R, which corresponds to 36.8 J kg–1 K–1 for 2. This fact can be mainly due to magnetic anisotropy
of the NiII ions and the intra- and intercubane AF interactions
between the GdIII ions (both the increase of D and AF interactions diminishes −ΔSm). The −ΔSm value
for 2 is larger than those observed for complexes with
a Gd/Ni = 0.5 but lower than those found for other more dense complexes
with Gd/Ni ratios in the range 1–4.2.47 The MCE increases with the increase of the Gd/Ni ratio as expected
for increasing the spin and decreasing the magnetic anisotropy.

and 6 K and magnetic entropy changes (inset) extracted from the experimental

The χMT product of compounds
Ni4Tb4 (3) and Ni4Dy4 (4) steadily decreases with decreasing temperature
to minimum values of 49.1 cm3 K mol–1 at 35 K for 3 and 54.74 cm3 K mol–1 at 12 K for 4 and then sharply increases at lower temperatures
up to 2 K in the case of 3 and to reach a maximum value
of 55.5 cm3 K mol–1 at 5 K for 4. Below this temperature, the χMT value for 4 drops down to 2 K. As usual,
the decrease of the χMT product
in the high temperature region (above 40 K) is due to the depopulation
of the MJ sublevels of the TbIII and DyIII ions, which arise from the splitting of the
ground term by the ligand field. The increase of χMT at low temperature is likely to be due to a ferromagnetic
interaction between NiII and LnIII, whereas
the decrease of χMT below 5 K for 4 is essentially associated with the magnetic anisotropy of
the NiII ions. For complexes 5 and 6, the χMT product decreases steadily
with decreasing temperature until approximately 20 K and then more
sharply down to 2 K. The observed behavior is mainly due to the depopulation
of the MJ sublevels of the LnIII ions, which are able to overcome (together with the effect of the
NiII anisotropy) the effect of the presumable NiII–LnIII ferromagnetic interactions in the low temperature
region. This behavior is rather common in HoIII and ErIII complexes. In the case of complexes 3 and 4, the opposite situation occurs, so that the NiII–LnIII ferromagnetic interactions are strong enough
as to overcome the effect of the depopulation of the MJ sublevels, and an increase in χMT is observed at a low temperature. The fact that the χMT for 3 reaches a rather larger
value than 4 at 2 K seems to indicate that the NiII–LnIII magnetic coupling is stronger for
the former.

The magnetization versus field plots for complexes 3–6 at T = 2 K (Figure 6) show a fast increase
of the magnetization up to ∼1 T, which supports the ferromagnetic
interaction between NiII and LnIII in these
complexes, and then a slow increase with the field without reaching
saturation at 5 T, which is mainly due to the presence of significant
magnetic anisotropy and/or low-lying excited states that are partially
populated at this temperature. The presence of low-lying excited states
is in agreement with the existence of weak Ni–Ln magnetic interactions
in these complexes. It should be noted that the magnetization values
at the highest applied dc magnetic field of 5 T are however almost
the half of those calculated for non-interacting NiII and
LnIII ions (Table 2), which is, as usual, mainly attributed to crystal-field
effects giving rise to significant magnetic anisotropy.48 The fact that the slope of the M versus H plot below 1 T is higher for 3 than for 4 seems to support a stronger NiII–LnIII magnetic coupling for the former. The smaller
slope for 5 and 6 could indicate a weaker
magnetic coupling than in complexes 3 and 4. Nevertheless, these qualitative suggestions should be taken with
caution as the crystal field splitting of the ground term by the ligand
field is different for each of the complexes 3–6 and therefore their ability for counterbalancing the effect of the
NiII–LnIII ferromagnetic coupling.

To know if these complexes exhibit
slow relaxation and possible
SMM behavior, dynamic ac magnetic susceptibility measurements as a
function of the temperature at different frequencies were performed
on complexes 1–6 under zero and 1000 Oe external
dc field. Only complexes 3 and 4 showed
out-of-phase (χM″) signals below 4 K (Figure S15), but none of them exhibited any maximum in the temperature dependence
of χM″ above 2 K at frequencies reaching 1400 Hz, even in the presence
of a small dc field to fully or partly suppress the possible quantum
tunneling relaxation (this process is able in some cases to prevent
the observation of slow relaxation of the magnetization). Therefore,
in these two complexes either the energy barrier for the flipping
of the magnetization is not enough as to block the magnetization above
2 K or there exists a very fast resonant zero-field quantum tunneling
of the magnetization (which cannot be eliminated by applying a small
dc field) with a flipping rate that is too fast to give rise to a
maximum in the χM″ above 2 K. This behavior can be related to the existence
of very weak Ni···Ln and Ln···Ln magnetic
interactions in complexes 3–6. These interactions
generate small separations of the low-lying split sublevels, which
lead to very small energy barrier for the flipping of the magnetization
and, moreover, favor QTM by mixing of low-lying excited states in
the ground state.

Summary
A compartmental ligand,
2-methoxy-6-[{2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino}methyl]phenol
(LH3), was utilized to assemble heterometallic octanuclear
Ni4Ln4 complexes. Structural studies of these
complexes reveal that they are made up of two tetranuclear [Ni2Ln2O4] cubane subunits. The core of
the assembly consists of a tetranuclear lanthanide motif, where two
four-membered [Ln2(μ-OH)2] subunits are
linked to each other by four acetate and two hydroxide bridging ligands.
Magnetic studies on these complexes reveal a ferromagnetic interaction
between the lanthanide and the nickel centers, the magnitude of which
for the GdIII analogue has been estimated as J = + 0.86 cm–1. While none of the complexes are
SMMs because of the existence of very weak Ni···Ln
and Ln···Ln magnetic interactions, the NiII4GdIII4 complex shows a magneto-caloric
effect with a maximum magnetic entropy change, −ΔSm = 22.58 J kg–1 K–1 at 3 K for an applied external field of 5 T.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
Solvents and other general reagents
used in this work were purified according to standard procedures.49,50o-Vanillin, nickel acetate tetrahydrate, and tetramethyl
ammonium hydroxide pentahydrate were obtained from Spectrochem Pvt.
Ltd., Mumbai, India. N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine
and Ln(NO3)3·xH2O (x = 6, for Ln = Y and Gd; x =
5 for Ln = Dy, Tb, Ho, and Er) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemical
Co. (USA). All these chemicals were used as obtained without further
purification. The ligand 2-methoxy-6-[2{-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylimino}methyl]phenol
(LH3) was prepared following a previously reported procedure.51,52

Instrumentation
Melting points were measured using
a JSGW melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were
recorded with a PerkinElmer Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.
Mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker micrOTOF-Q II spectrometer.
Powder X-ray diffraction data of all the complexes were collected
with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Elemental analyses of the compounds
were obtained from a Euro Vector EA instrument (CHNS-O, model EuroEA3000).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by TA Instrument
(model: Discovery TGA).

Magnetic Measurements
Static magnetic
properties were
measured on polycrystalline samples of the complexes in the temperature
range 2–300 K under an applied field of 1000 Oe using a Quantum
Design SQUID MPMS XL-5 magnetometer. Field dependence of the dynamic
(ac) susceptibility measurements were carried out using an alternating
ac field of 3.5 Oe in the frequency range 1–1500 Hz. The static
experimental susceptibilities were corrected for the diamagnetism
of the constituent atoms (using Pascal’s constants) and for
the sample holder. To avoid any torquing of the microcrystals, a pellet
of the sample cut into very small fragments was introduced in the
sample holder.

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal
X-ray structural
studies of 1–6 were performed on a Bruker APEX
II CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα
radiation (λα = 0.71073 Å) at 100(2) K.
The crystals did not degrade/decompose during data collection. The
frames were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the SMART and SAINT
software package.53 Absorption correction
was performed by a multiscan method implemented in SADABS.54 Space groups were determined using XPREP implemented
in APEX2.55 The structures were solved
with the ShelXT56 structure solution program
using intrinsic phasing and refined with the ShelXL57 refinement package using least squares minimization in
the Olex258 software. All the nonhydrogen
atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. All the hydrogen
atoms except the bridging −OH atoms were included in idealized
positions, and a riding model was used. Lattice solvent molecules
could not be satisfactorily modeled by the present analysis because
of heavy disorder associated with it. Therefore, the “PLATON/SQUEEZE”
program59 was used to remove those disordered
solvent molecules. All the mean plane analyses and crystallographic
figures have been generated using the DIAMOND software (version 3.2).60

Synthesis of Complexes 1–6
The
general synthetic protocol that was used for the preparation of the
metal complexes (1–6) is as follows: a methanolic
solution (5 mL) of Ln(NO3)3·xH2O (1 eq) (where x = 6 for 1 and 2, and x = 5 for 3–6) was added dropwise to a 15 mL methanolic solution containing a
mixture of LH3 (1 eq) and tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide
(2 eq) with constant stirring. To this reaction mixture, solid Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (1 eq) was added and
the resulting deep orange-colored solution stirred further for 12
h. The volume of the solution was reduced to ∼10 mL by rotary
evaporation, filtered, and kept undisturbed for crystallization under
ambient conditions. Slow evaporation of the solvent afforded green,
block-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray analysis after 2 weeks. The
stoichiometry of the reactants involved in each reaction, the yield
