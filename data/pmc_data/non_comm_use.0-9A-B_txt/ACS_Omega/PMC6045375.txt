Graphene
quantum dots (GQDs) are zero-dimensional materials that
exhibit characteristics of both graphene and quantum dots. Herein,
we report a rapid, relatively green, one-pot synthesis of size-tunable
GQDs from graphene oxide (GO) by a sonochemical method with intermittent
microwave heating, keeping the reaction temperature constant at 90
°C. The GQDs were synthesized by oxidative cutting of GO using
KMnO4 as an oxidizing agent within a short span of time
(30 min) in an acid-free condition. The synthesized GQDs were of high
quality and exhibited good quantum yield (23.8%), high product yield
(>75%), and lower cytotoxicity (tested up to 1000 μg/mL).
Furthermore,
the as-synthesized GQDs were demonstrated as excellent fluorescent
probes for bioimaging and label-free sensing of Fe(III) ions, with
a detection limit as low as 10 × 10–6 M.

1 Introduction
Graphene,
being a sheet of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer of sp2 bonded
carbon atoms, does not show optical photoluminescence
(PL) due to the absence of band gap, which limits its application
in optical imaging. However, by converting this two-dimensional (2D)
graphene sheet into zero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQDs),
its band gap can be tuned due to quantum confinement and the edge
effect, which has unlocked a large window of applications.1 GQDs consist of an atomic layer of nanosized
graphite that shows excellent properties of graphene, like large surface
area, high carrier transport mobility, superior mechanical flexibility,
and excellent thermal and chemical stability. When compared to widely
explored typical semiconductor quantum dots (CdSe, CdTe, and PbTe),
GQDs show superior properties, such as high photostability, aqueous
dispersibility, biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, low cost, etc.2−5 The unique properties of GQDs find applications in bioimaging,6−8 optical sensing,9−13 photovoltaics,14−16 light emitting diodes,17 photocatalysis,18 photodetectors,19 and so forth. Irrespective of the emerging reports
on GQDs over the past 5 years, their wide applicability is limited
due to the usage of malicious corrosive chemicals and prolonged reaction
time for synthesis.

GQDs have been synthesized from different
carbon-based materials
like fullerene,20 graphene oxide (GO),21−25 graphite rods,26 carbon nanotube,27 glucose,1,28 carbon fibers,6 coal,29 etc. Several
reports exist describing the synthesis of GQDs using various approaches,
such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, sonochemical, corrosive chemical
oxidation, high-resolution electron beam cutting, etc. Indeed, microwave-assisted
synthetic methods offer several advantages when they are used in combination.
With their extremely short reaction time, the utilization of the microwave-assisted
method is quite remarkable for rapid, one-step synthesis of nanomaterials
that have high energy of activation to achieve high product yield.
Some of the limitations of recent reports on the various synthesis
parameters, quantum yield, and product yield of GQDs are discussed
here. Zhu et al. reported a one-step ultrasonic synthesis of GQDs
with a relatively higher quantum yield of 27.8%, but the time period
taken for synthesis was 4 h.30 Li et al.
reported microwave-assisted synthesis of greenish-yellow luminescent
GQDs that involved use of strong acids and a quantum yield up to 11.7%.31 In another report, Wang et al. prepared white-light-emitting
GQDs by a two-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, where corrosive
acids were used as the oxidizing agent with a reaction time of 14
h.32 Shin et al. obtained GQDs with a relatively
poor quantum yield of 9% synthesized from graphite using high-power
microwave irradiation (600 W) in the presence of sulfuric acid.33 In another work, Lin et al. prepared water-soluble
GQDs with 9.9 wt % product yield from graphite flakes using a potassium-intercalation
method.34 Thus, a rapid, environmentally
benign method for the synthesis of high-quality GQDs with better quantum
yield, product yield, aqueous dispersibility, and low cytotoxicity
is highly required for futuristic biomedical applications.

Herein,
we report a facile, rapid, one-step acid-free synthetic
route using the sonochemical method with intermittent microwave heating
for the synthesis of high-quality GQDs with better properties. The
GQDs were synthesized within a short span of time (30 min) and exhibited
good quantum yield, high product yield, and lower cytotoxicity. Till
date, not many reports exist where green synthesis of GQDs with cell
viability were demonstrated for higher concentrations.35−37 Typically, synthesis of GQDs from graphene oxide involves a tedious
procedure that uses harsh chemicals (strong acids and organic solvents),
elevated temperature, and prolonged reaction times. However, our synthetic
approach employs KMnO4 for the oxidative cutting of GO
in an aqueous medium with the simultaneous treatment of both ultrasound
and microwave irradiations (Scheme 1). Thereafter, the as-synthesized GQDs were well characterized
for their structural and chemical properties. The cytotoxicity and
amicability of GQDs as fluorescent probe in bioimaging applications
were also explored. Further, the GQDs were used for the sensitive
and label-free detection of metal ions (Fe(III) ions), with a detection
limit as low as 10 μM. Thus, our study demonstrates the synthesized
GQDs possess significant potential in metal-ion sensing and bioimaging
applications.

Intermittent Microwave Heating, Keeping the Reaction Temperature Constant
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of GQDs
GQDs were synthesized by oxidative cutting of GO
using KMnO4 as an oxidizing agent via a one-step sonochemical
method, with intermittent
microwave heating, in 30 min at different microwave powers, keeping
the reaction temperature constant at 90 °C. Samples synthesized
using different microwave powers of 100, 200, 300, and 400 W were
labeled as GQD 1, GQD 2, GQD 3, and GQD 4, respectively. The product
yield of GQD 1–4 was calculated and obtained in the range of
75–81%. The morphology and nanostructure of GQDs were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). Figure 1a–d
showed the TEM images of as-synthesized GQDs with relatively uniform
shape and size distribution. The corresponding histograms shown in
the inset of Figure 1a–d revealed that GQD 1, GQD 2, GQD 3, and GQD 4 have an average
lateral diameter of 5, 4, 3, and 2 nm, respectively. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (Figure 1e–h) were also found
to be in agreement with the corresponding histograms. The fast Fourier
transform (FFT) patterns of GQD samples were presented as inset figures
of corresponding HR-TEM images. From HR-TEM images of single GQD (Figure 1i–l), two
types of lattice parameters, 0.210 and 0.242 nm, which correspond
to the hexagonal lattice plane spacing of d1100 and d1120, respectively, were obtained.
The AFM image (Figure S3) showed the typical
topographic morphology of GQDs, and the section profile revealed an
average height of 2.5 nm that corresponds to approximately 2–3
layers of graphene.

GQD 4 samples
over large area (scale bar 20 nm) and the inset histograms show size
distribution of corresponding GQDs. HR-TEM images of (e) GQD 1, (f)
GQD 2, (g) GQD 3, and (h) GQD 4 samples (scale bar 5 nm) and corresponding
FFT patterns of GQDs were shown as inset images. HR-TEM images of
single GQD show the lattice fringes of (i) GQD 1, (j) GQD 2, (k) GQD
3, and (l) GQD 4 samples (scale bar 2 nm).

Further, the surface functionalities of GO and GQDs were
studied
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. From the FTIR spectra (Figure 2a), it could be inferred that
all of the GQDs exhibited the characteristic peak of the carboxyl
group at 1386 cm–1, carbonyl group at 1700 cm–1, and a broad absorption peak at 3431 cm–1 due to bending vibrations of O–H bonds. Peaks at 2920 and
2850 cm–1 are associated with the stretching vibrations
of C–H bonds and the peak at 1615 cm–1 is
due to C=C bonds of benzene ring vibrations. The peaks at 1258
and 1035 cm–1 are attributed to the vibrational
absorption bands of C–O–C and C–O stretching
vibrations in epoxides, respectively. It was observed that the presence
of carboxylic, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups render GQDs easily dispersible
in water with good stability.

XPS survey spectra, XPS high-resolution spectra of C 1s analysis of
(c) GO and (d) GQD 4 samples. (e) Raman spectra of GO and GQD 4 samples.
(f) XRD patterns of GO and GQD 4 samples.

Among the GQDs synthesized, GQD 4 was studied in detail due
to
its smaller size and higher quantum yield. XPS measurements were carried
out to investigate the chemical compositions of GO and GQD 4 samples.
The survey spectra (Figure S4) clearly
showed C 1s and O 1s peaks at ∼284.6 and ∼533 eV, respectively,
indicating mainly carbon and oxygen elements are present in GO and
GQD 4 samples. Apart from this, insignificant amounts of N 1s and
Na 1s peaks also appeared in the survey spectra of GO at ∼399
and ∼1069 eV, which may be originated from NaNO3 and NaOH used in the synthesis of GO. Further, elemental compositions
were estimated from survey spectra (Figure 2b). A comparison of the high-resolution spectra
of C 1s revealed an obvious change in the carbon chemical environments
from GO to GQDs. It is known that GQDs are merited with excellent
stability and hydrophilicity due to the abundant hydroxyl and carboxylic
groups on their surface and edges. This was evident by C 1s spectra,
which confirmed that the synthesized GQDs were decorated with hydroxyl,
carbonyl, and carboxylic acid functionalities (Figure 2d). Moreover, when compared to C 1s high-resolution
spectra of GO (Figure 2c), the composition of oxygen chemical environments in C 1s high-resolution
spectra of the GQD sample was found to be increased, which indicates
that strong oxidation has occurred.

Figure 2e shows
the Raman spectra of GO and GQD samples. In the case of GQD 4, the
D band (1360 cm–1) and G band (1580 cm–1) were recorded with the intensity ratio (ID/IG) of 0.90. The integrated intensity
ratio of the disorder D band to the crystalline G band (ID/IG) for GO was 0.78, which
increased to 0.90 after the oxidative cutting to form GQDs. The increased
disorder may be due to the introduction of defects to the graphene
basal planes and edges. Additionally, the –1 in
Raman spectra indicate the formation of high-quality GQDs.38 The typical XRD patterns of GO sheets and GQD
4 are shown in Figure 2f. The XRD pattern of GO showed a strong diffraction peak at 2θ
of 10.4° (002), whereas the GQD 4 sample showed a broader (002)
peak centered at 21.4°. Further, GO showed a d-spacing value of 0.849 nm due to the introduction of functional
groups. The d-spacing of GQD 4 was calculated to
be 0.409 nm, which is smaller than that of GO, and this is because
GQDs are oxidized only at the edges due to their very small size.

The optical properties of fluorescent GQDs were studied using UV–vis
and PL spectra. Figure 3a shows UV–vis spectra of GQD samples of different sizes synthesized
namely, GQD 1–4. A distinct broad absorption peak at 350 nm
and a strong absorption below 300 nm were observed from the spectra,
which are attributed to the n−π* transition and π–π*
transition of aromatic sp2 domains, respectively. Additionally,
a slight shift toward the blue region from 360 to 330 nm was observed
as the size of GQDs decreased. This result indicates that the size
of GQDs can significantly affect the absorption properties of GQDs.
The inset of Figure 3a shows the photographs of GQDs of different sizes irradiated under
365 nm UV light and GQD 4 sample under day light.

spectra of GQD samples excited at 350 nm. (c) PL spectra of the GQD
4 sample at different excitation wavelengths from 350 to 420 nm.

Figure 3b shows
the corresponding PL spectra of the as-synthesized GQD samples. The
different emission color may indicate the size-dependent nature of
GQDs. The emission maxima of GQD 1, GQD 2, GQD 3, and GQD 4 solutions
were at 510, 480, 460, and 430 nm, respectively. In addition, GQD
samples displayed excitation-dependent emission and when the excitation
wavelength is varied from 340 to 420 nm, a redshift was observed with
a remarkable decrease in PL intensity, as shown in Figure 3c. GQDs usually have a quantum
confinement effect, i.e., they have a size-dependent effect on their
PL properties. Here, the quantum confinement effect was confirmed
by the PL spectra (Figure 3b) and HR-TEM images (Figure 1e–h), i.e., smaller sized GQD samples lead to
blueshift in the emission. Further, the quantum yield was estimated
using quinine sulfate in 0.05 M sulfuric acid solution as the reference
(Table 1). It is remarkable
that the maximum quantum yield of 23.8% was obtained for GQD 4 sample.

2.2 Sensing
of Fe3+ Ions
GQDs
could be promising nanomaterials as fluorescent sensors due to their
small size, unique optical properties, and high photostability. In
the present study, we explored the as-synthesized GQD 4 sample for
sensitive, selective, and label-free detection of Fe3+ metal
ions. It is well known that Fe3+ ions play an important
role in the biochemical process in living systems by complexation
with various regulatory proteins. On the other hand, excess Fe3+ ions can lead to overproduction of free radicals and hence
cytotoxicity. The high Fe3+ concentration in neurons is
also a key marker for Parkinson’s disease.32 Therefore, the detection of Fe3+ ions in biological
systems as well as their environmental monitoring is important. To
study the selectivity of a synthesized fluorescent probe, the effect
of various metal ions (Fe3+, Na+, K+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, etc.) of same concentration (100 μM) on the fluorescent intensity
of the GQD 4 sample (0.05 mg/mL) was studied by recording their PL
spectra upon the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. As shown in Figure 4a, there is an apparent
quenching of fluorescence intensity in the presence of Fe3+ when compared with other metal ions. From previous reports, it is
clear that the hydroxyl groups showed a good binding affinity toward
Fe3+ ions. The fluorescence quenching in the case of Fe3+ ion may be due to the complexation of Fe3+ ions
and phenolic hydroxyl groups of GQDs, which resulted in the electron
transfer to d-orbital of Fe3+ ions.39,40 Thus, fluorescence quenching of GQDs are highly sensitive and selective
to Fe3+ ions, whereas other metal ions are not able to
exert significant quenching and hence GQDs can be used for the selective
sensing of Fe3+ ions.

Figure 4 (a) Effect of different metal ions (concentration,
100 μM)
on the fluorescent intensity of GQDs (0.05 mg/mL), (b) photographs
of GQDs with different concentrations of Fe3+ ions (0,
20, 600, and 800 μM) under 365 nm UV light (c) PL emission spectra
of GQDs in the presence of varying concentrations of Fe3+ ions (0–800 μM), and (d) linear regression plot performed
in the low concentration range of 10–120 μM.

Figure 4b shows
the photographs of GQDs in the presence of different concentrations
of Fe3+ ions (0, 20, 600, and 800 μM) under 365 nm
UV light irradiation. From Figure 4c, it could be observed that fluorescence quenching
of Fe3+ ion is concentration dependent and therefore experiments
were carried out at various concentrations of Fe3+ ions
(0–800 μM). It was observed that the fluorescence intensity
of GQDs gradually decreases upon increasing Fe3+-ion concentration.
The quenching efficiency showed a good linear relationship with the
linear regression value, R2, of 0.9926
for a concentration of a range of 10–120 μM of Fe3+ ions (Figure 4d). Thus, GQDs were used for sensitive and label-free detection of
metal ions [Fe(III) ions], with a detection limit as low as 10 μM.

To investigate the fluorescence response between GQDs and Fe3+, TEM imaging (Figure 5a,b) was done where the morphology change is observed, which
shows that size of the GQD–Fe3+ complex increases
when compared to that of GQD 4 (Figure 1d). This provides convincing evidence for the aggregation
of GQDs in the presence of Fe3+. Also, the FTIR spectrum
of the GQD–Fe3+ complex shows redshift and weakened
absorbance of characteristic peaks when compared to that of GQD (Figure S5). This indicates that there is a change
in the chemical behavior of surface functionalities of GQDs due to
the strong affinity between Fe3+ and phenolic hydroxyl
groups of GQDs. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime of GQD and
the GQD–Fe3+ complex was studied using time-correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC). The fluorescence lifetime of GQDs
is 2.57 ns and has three components: 2.5 ns (ca. 46%), 0.6 ns (ca.
12%), and 7.4 ns (ca. 42%). On addition of Fe3+ ions, the
average decay time of the GQD–Fe3+ complex is decreased
to 0.037 ns, which confirms the formation of the GQD–Fe3+ complex (Figure 5c). Thus, the changes observed in morphology, fluorescence
lifetime, and FTIR spectra confirm the formation of the aggregate
complex between GQDs and Fe3+ ions, resulting in the fluorescence
quenching of GQDs.

2.3 Cytotoxicity
Assay of GQDs
The biocompatibility
of the synthesized GQDs were assessed against human cervical cancer
cell line HeLa cells using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] (MTT) assay. GQD 4 samples were tested in this study because
of their smaller size and high quantum yield. HeLa cells were incubated
at six different concentrations of GQD 4 (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and
1000 μg/mL) for 24 h. The potential toxicity of the nanoparticles
is determined by a colorimetric technique based on the ability of
live cells to reduce yellow MTT to purple formazan crystals.41Figure 6a shows that the GQD sample has low cytotoxicity, with a cell
viability ≥90% for concentrations ranging from 25 to 1000 μg/mL.
It is noteworthy that GQDs even at a relatively higher concentration
of 1000 μg/mL have not showed cytotoxicity with a cell viability
of >92%. Moreover, the morphology of the cells incubated with GQDs
appeared normal as that of the untreated control cells. Thus, the
MTT assay as well as visual observation of the cells ascertained the
excellent biocompatibility for GQDs. Thus, GQDs could be used as efficient
biocompatible nanoprobes for bioimaging as well as for theranostic
applications. Considering the excellent biocompatibility and photostability
of the GQDs, they were further utilized as fluorescent nanoprobes
for bioimaging applications. The concentration at which the maximum
viability was observed was taken as the optimum concentration for
cellular uptake studies.

and absence of GQD 4, with an excitation of 350 nm, (b) and (c) showed
the fluorescent image and bright field image of the HeLa cells with
GQD 4 (25 μg/mL) and (d) and (e) showed the fluorescent and
bright field images of the HeLa cells without GQDs (scale bar 20 μm).

2.4 In Vitro
Bioimaging Studies
One of
the major challenges in cellular imaging using semiconductor quantum
dots is its intrinsic toxicity that has limited its application. The
GQDs synthesized in this work showed several advantages over those
of existing ones in terms of ease of size tunability, green synthetic
approach, surface functionality, physiological stability, photostability,
size-tuned emission, and excellent biocompatibility, making it suitable
for bioimaging applications. The in vitro cellular imaging studies
of the GQD 4 sample were carried on HeLa cells. The optimum concentration
chosen for cellular uptake studies was 25 μg/mL. The GQD sample
was incubated with HeLa cells for a period of 4 h. This was visualized
by the intrinsic fluorescence property of the GQDs when excited using
the A360/10 excitation filter. The blue fluorescence observed was
uniformly distributed throughout the cell. The transmitted light images
of the cells and their corresponding fluorescence images have been
shown in Figure 6b,c.
The bright field images of the cells incubated with GQDs showed normal
morphology of HeLa cells (Figure 6c), confirming the biocompatibility of GQDs. The cells
incubated with GQDs exhibited bright blue fluorescence, and this was
clearly observed in the fluorescent image when excited at a wavelength
of 350 nm (Figure 6b). Figure 6d,e shows
the fluorescent and bright field images of the HeLa cells without
GQDs. It could be noted that there is no fluorescence in control cells,
confirming that the emission is from the GQDs in Figure 6b. The GQDs were found to be
cell membrane-permeable and found to generate fluorescence inside
the cell. It could be observed that GQDs owing to their size, biocompatibility,
and surface functionality can be easily internalized through the cell
membrane. It is well documented that carboxylated GQDs exhibit good
biocompatibility and great potential for in vitro as well as in vivo
bioimaging applications.42 Thus, these
GQDs serve as a suitable nanoprobe that has immense potential in live-cell
imaging as well as biomedical applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we reported a rapid, acid-free,
one-step sonochemical
strategy with intermittent microwave heating for the synthesis of
size-tunable high-quality GQDs by the oxidative cutting of GO using
KMnO4 in half an hour. The synthesized GQDs are highly
crystalline and have uniform size distribution. These GQDs exhibited
good quantum yield up to 23.8%, high product yield (75–81%),
and stable size-dependent photoluminescence in aqueous solutions.
Our studies indicate that the GQDs possess very good biocompatibility,
good aqueous dispersibility, and high photostability and hence can
be applied as excellent fluorescent probes for live-cell imaging.
Fluorogenic probes are of particular interest in the area of cancer
detection or bioimaging. Our findings on the biocompatibility and
fluorogenic property of the GQDs observed in cancer cells highlight
their significance in clinical diagnostic applications. The GQDs synthesized
were also demonstrated for the detection of physiologically relevant
metal ions and particularly for the sensing of Fe3+ ions
in aqueous media.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Graphite (<150 μm),
sodium nitrate (NaNO3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), quinine sulfate, and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium permanganate
(KMnO4) was purchased from SD Fine-Chemicals Limited. Ultrapure
deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm, 25 °C, Milli-Q D3, Merck,
Germany) was used in all of the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis
of Graphene Oxide
Graphene
oxide (GO) was synthesized by the Hummers method (Figure S1). Two grams of natural graphite was added to a cold
(0 °C) concentrated solution of H2SO4 and
NaNO3 (4 g) in a 500 mL flask with vigorous stirring by
keeping the temperature of the mixture below 10 °C. The reaction
mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 2 h until it becomes pasty brown
and was then diluted with 100 mL deionized water in an ice bath. Again,
it is stirred for 30 min and H2O2 (20 mL, 30
wt %) was added slowly to the mixture to reduce the residual KMnO4, after which the color of the mixture changes to brilliant
yellow. The sample was then filtered and washed with 800 mL of 5%
HCl to remove the metal ions, followed by the addition of excess of
deionized water to remove the acid. Later, the solution was centrifuged,
dried at 60 °C, and used for further characterizations.

4.3 Synthesis of GQDs
GQDs were prepared
from GO using KMnO4 as an oxidizing agent in 30 min by
the sonochemical method with intermittent microwave heating, keeping
the reaction temperature constant at 90 °C. Briefly, 1 mg/mL
GO and 1 M KMnO4 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio in a RB flask
to form a homogeneous mixture. This mixture was treated under microwave
irradiation along with ultrasonication in a microwave reactor (SienoUWave
1000) at 90 °C, operating at different microwave powers of 100,
200, 300, and 400 W for 30 min. After this treatment, the mixture
was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to remove the unreacted GO.
The supernatant containing GQD was collected after the centrifugation.
The supernatant solution was then filtered through a 0.45 μm
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane, and the filtrate was dialyzed
in a 1000 Da dialysis bag. After purification, the solvent was evaporated
to obtain solid GQDs. TEM images of GQDs synthesized using the sonochemical
method without microwave heating showed the formation of GQDs with
large size (Figure S2).

4.4 Characterizations
Scanning electron
microscope micrographs were acquired using an EVO 18 Special Edition
scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) operated at 20
kV acceleration voltage. The size and morphology of GQDs were observed
through a transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at an accelerating
voltage of 300 kV. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images and energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis were performed on an FEI Tecnai 30 G2S-TWIN transmission
electron microscope. The HR-TEM images were further analyzed with
Gatan Digital Micrograph software. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging
was performed using a MultiMode 8 AFM equipped with NanoScope V controller
(Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) in air at ambient temperature (22 ±
2 °C). Si cantilevers (NSG 01, NT-MDT) with a typical radius
of curvature of approximately 10 nm were used. The force constants
of the AFM probe were in the range of 2.5–10 N/m and with a
resonance frequency in the range of 120–180 kHz. The scan rate
used was 1 Hz. Raw data were processed offline using Bruker’s
NanoScope Analysis software. The FTIR spectra were measured with a
Perkin Elmer Series Spectrum Two FTIR spectrometer over the wavenumber
range 4000–500 cm–1. The sample was directly
mixed and pelletized with KBr. Wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements
were performed with the XEUSS SAXS/WAXS system using the Genisxmicro
source from Xenocs operated at 50 kV and 0.6 mA. The Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54 Å) was collimated with an FOX2D mirror and two
pairs of scattering less slits from Xenocs. The 2D patterns were recorded
on a Mar345 image plate and processed using Fit2D software. The UV–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra of the GQDs were obtained using
a spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-2401 PC; Shimadzu, Japan), employing
a 1 cm path length quartz cell at room temperature. The photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of GQDs were recorded on a Spex-Fluorolog FL22 spectrofluorimeter
equipped with a double grating 0.22 m Spex 1680 monochromator and
a 450 W Xe lamp as the excitation source. Raman spectra were obtained
using the WITec Raman microscope (Witec Inc. Germany, alpha 300R),
with a laser beam directed to the sample through a 60× water
immersion objective and a Peltier cooled CCD detector. Samples were
excited with a 632.8 nm excitation wavelength laser, and Stokes-shifted
Raman spectra were collected in the range of 0–3000 cm–1 with 1 cm–1 resolution. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD instrument equipped with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source
(hν = 1486.6 eV) operating at 15 kV and 10
mA (150 W). The survey scans were obtained over the range 0–1200
eV binding energy (BE) at pass energy of 160 eV and used to estimate
the surface elemental composition. High-resolution spectra were recorded
for C 1s with a pass energy of 20 eV. The Kratos charge neutralizer
system was used on all samples. Sample charging effects on the measured
BE positions were corrected by setting the lowest BE component of
the C 1s spectral envelope to 284.7 eV, corresponding to the C–C/C–H
species. The deconvolution of peaks was performed by using the CasaXPS
software. Quantum yield was measured using quinine sulfate in 0.05
M sulfuric acid solution as a standard. Fluorescence lifetime experiments
were conducted using a Delta Flex modular time-correlated single photon
counting (TCSPC) spectrometer system, employing the 330 nm nanoLED
as the excitation source and PPD 850 detector. Decay in the fluorescence
intensity (I) with time (t) was
fitted by three exponential functions. The quality of the fits was
checked by examining the χ2 value. All experiments
were run in triplicate, with similar results obtained.

4.5 Sensing of Fe3+ Ions
The
sensitive detection of Fe3+ ions was done in aqueous medium
at room temperature. To study the sensitivity toward Fe3+, fluorescence emission spectrum of GQDs (0.05 mg/mL) was recorded
upon the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Then, a series of different
concentrations of Fe3+ (0–800 μM) was freshly
prepared and added into the aqueous solution containing the same amount
of GQDs (0.05 mg/mL) and the corresponding fluorescence spectra were
recorded under the same excitation wavelength. The selectivity of
Fe3+ sensing was evaluated by adding other common metal
ions (Na+, K+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, and Ni2+) of same concentration (100
μM) to GQD solution (0.05 mg/mL), and the PL emission spectra
were recorded under identical conditions.

4.6 Maintenance
of Cell Lines
The cell
line used in the present study is human cervical cancer cell line,
HeLa cells, obtained from National Centre for Cell Science, Pune,
India. For maintenance of cell lines, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco),
antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin),
and amphotericin (0.25 μg/mL) (HiMedia) were employed. The cells
were maintained in CO2 incubators at 37 °C with 5%
CO2 in air and 99% humidity. The passaging of cells when
confluent was carried out using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (HiMedia) in phosphate-buffered saline. Experiments were carried
out after 36 h of seeding the cells at appropriate density in suitable
well plates.

4.7 Assessment of Cell Viability
The
cell viability after incubating HeLa cells with GQDs was determined
by the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
(MTT) assay. It is a colorimetric assay based on the ability of live
but not dead cells to reduce the tetrazolium component of MTT into
purple formazan crystals. The cells were spread in 96-well plates
at 5 × 103 cells/well. After 36 h of seeding, the
cells were incubated with different concentrations of GQDs (25, 50,
100, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells
were exposed to MTT at a concentration of 50 μg/well for 2.5–3
h at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. The working solution
of MTT was prepared in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS). After
viewing formazan crystals under the microscope, crystals were solubilized
by treating the cells with dimethyl sulfoxide/isopropanol solvent
mixture at a ratio of 1:1 for 20 min, at 37 °C. The percentage
of cell viability was determined by recording the optical absorbance
at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy-4 Multimode reader, Biotek,
Winooski, VT) relative to the nontreated cells. The cell viability
was calculated using the following equation  where IntGQDs is the optical density
(OD) value of the cells incubated with different concentrations of
GQDs and Intcontrol is the OD value of the cells incubated
with the culture medium alone. Cell viability of control cells were
kept as 100%.

4.8 Cellular Uptake of GQDs
and in Vitro Bioimaging
The cellular uptake studies of the
GQDs were executed by fluorescence
imaging of HeLa cells. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 ×
103 cells/well of 96-well black plates (BD Biosciences)
for the purpose. After 36 h of seeding, the cells were incubated with
GQDs (25 μg/mL) in HBSS for 4 h. Twenty five micrograms per
milliliter was chosen for cellular uptake studies as at this concentration
maximum cell viability was observed. Subsequently, cells were washed
thrice with HBSS to remove the unbound particles. Images of the cells
were collected by a high-content spinning disk facility (BD Pathway
855; BD Biosciences) using AttoVision 1.5.3 software. The images were
taken at 40× magnification, using A360/10 excitation filter and
435 LP emission filter.
