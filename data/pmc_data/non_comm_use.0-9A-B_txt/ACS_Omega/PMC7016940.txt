The
activity and selectivity of hydrotalcites (HTs) can be suitably
enhanced by the addition of different metal oxides. Zinc and titanium
are prospective candidates for such a modification. Transesterification
of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with ethylene glycol (EG) using basic
catalysts is an industrially important process for the production
of bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET). BHET is a precursor for
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which is used in production of films,
fibers, and molding materials. As against use of polluting liquid
bases, solid bases could be employed. In the current work, transesterification
of DMT with EG was studied over modified HT base catalysts wherein
the HT was activated with the addition of zinc and titanium. These
catalysts were prepared by the combustion synthesis using different
fuels. The modified HT using Zn and Ti were well characterized by
scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry,
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analyzer, temperature-programmed
desorption, and X-ray diffraction. Effects of several parameters on
the rate of reaction and conversion of the limiting reagent were investigated.
Zinc-modified HT using glycine as fuel (Zn–HT–glycine)
was found to be the most selective, active, and reusable catalyst.
The Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson model
was used to establish the reaction mechanism and kinetics. All species
were weakly adsorbed leading to a second-order kinetics. Using a mole
ratio of 1:2 of DMT to EG and 0.05 g/cm3 Zn–HT–glycine
loading resulted in to 64.1% conversion of DMT and 96.1% selectivity
to BHET in 4 h at 180 °C. The apparent activation energy was
9.64 kcal/mol. The catalyst was robust and reusable.

1 Introduction
The
green chemistry principles basically aim at waste reduction
using atom economical safer processes, catalysis, and renewable resources.1 Catalysis is pivotal in developing economical
and energy efficient processes and many organic transformations could
be revisited from this angle.2 Heterogeneous
catalysis is inherently superior to homogeneous catalysis and offers
process intensification, easier catalyst separation, and less impact
on the environment, reduces waste, and improves process economics.3 Many traditional bulk and fine chemical manufacturing
facilities involve use of homogeneous bases which ought to be replaced
by solid bases. Among all, hydrotalcites (HTs) and their modified
structures have made great inroads in base catalyzed condensation
reactions which cover aldol, cross-aldol, Claisen–Schmidt,
and Knoevenagel condensations and also other reactions such as isomerization,
alkylation, and hydrolysis reactions.4−6

Transesterification
between dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with ethylene
glycol (EG) is a relevant process used for the production of bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate
(BHET) which is a monomer for making polyethylene terephthalate (PET).7−9 PET is the fastest growing thermoplastic polymer which is used in
the form of films, bottles, molding and fibers and increasingly in
blends, composites, and nanocomposites.10,11

Transesterification
is commonly catalyzed by acid or base catalysts12 and also by enzymes.14 Many
catalysts such as Zn, Mn, Mg, and lead acetates7 are commonly employed for the transesterification between
DMT and EG.13 In this reaction, a considerable
amount of byproducts such as methyl 2-hydroxy-ethylterephthalate and
methanol are formed along with BHET.9,14,15 The catalysts are homogeneous and nonreusable bases.
In general, the esterification and transesterification reactions of
carboxylic acids or esters with alcohols have been carried out over
homogeneous catalysts such as mineral acids, metal hydroxides, and
metal alkoxides. The replacement of these catalysts by solid catalysts
enjoys various advantages, as was stated before.8,15 The
effect of different homogeneous catalysts such as acetates of Pb,
Co, Mg, and Mn and of the mixtures of Mg, Mn, and Zn acetates has
been also studied.7,15,16 The reaction requires higher concentration of raw materials and
catalyst which subsequently necessitates neutralization of the reaction
mass and effluent treatment. Synthesis of poly(ethylene terepthalate)
(PET) by transesterification of DMT with EG was performed in the presence
of a few well-known catalysts including various lanthanide compounds.7,9 Mihail et al.16 suggested the reaction
order of transesterification of DMT and EG being fractional over zinc
oxide in the concentration range of 0.14–0.28%. Sorokin and
Chebotareva17 reported that the reaction
was first order with respect to EG over Zn stearate. However, it is
reported that the transesterification reaction was first order in
each DMT, EG, and homogenous catalyst concentration, making it overall
a third-order reaction.18 Besnoin et al.7 dealt with semi-batch melt transesterification
of DMT with EG using zinc acetate as a catalyst. However, all above
catalysts gave less selectivity toward BHET, requiring large catalyst/reactant
ratio and nongreen solvents. Serio et al.19 have prepared a basic heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification
of DMT with EG. Three different catalysts such as Al2O3, MgO, and calcined HT of Al–Mg with varying combination
of both metals were investigated for transesterification and successive
polycondensation to get poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) at 180
°C.

Transesterification reactions can be effectively conducted
using
HT which could be modified to render better activity and selectivity.
Synthesis of HTs can be achieved using coprecipitation,20 sol–gel,21 template-assisted synthesis,22 decomposition
of nitrates,23 and so forth. Such procedures
intrinsically contain a number of steps to get the final catalyst
making them lengthy and cumbersome, as well as they need a lot of
process water. Therefore, different protocols have been suggested
in the literature for synthesizing metal oxide(s) like HTs. Among
them, combustion synthesis is a powerful alternative for making materials
which not only render reproducible results but also involve reduced
number of steps. Combustion synthesis gives fine nanoscale metal oxides
depending on the source of fuel and ignition temperature. It can produce
metal oxides with high surface area, pore volume, and mesoporosity,
and therefore, it is one of the best methods to synthesize different
catalysts.24,25 Combustion synthesis needs a
fewer steps to make porous materials with controllable pore radii
and particle size according to application.24 In the current work, the combustion synthesis method was adopted
to prepare Ti- and Zn-modified HTs by using glycine and glycerol as
fuel which is one of the novel aspects of the current work. Previously,
Ti- and Zn-modified HTs were prepared by coprecipitation method and
characterized by different high-end characterization techniques. Velu
et al.26 have developed a novel series
of HT like anionic clays containing Zr4+ by a simple coprecipitation
method. Further rehydration behavior of Mg2+, Al3+ and Ti4+ containing layered double hydroxides (LDH) were
studied by Das and Samal.27 Selective catalytic
reduction of NO with ammonia was performed over Cu, CO, and Mn containing
HTs.28 In all these reports, the method
of preparation of modified HT is coprecipitation. The present work
deals with a comparative study of Zn- and Ti-modified HTs synthesized
by using the combustion method with two different fuels, namely, glycine
and glycerol. Thus, the prepared catalysts were used for the first
time to study the transesterification of DMT with EG in a solvent-free
condition, which has resulted into better selectivity for BHET. A
thorough investigation of catalyst synthesis and characterization
was undertaken, along with the reaction mechanism and kinetic model.
The current reaction is carried out with novel and cost-effective
zinc-modified HT base catalyst to achieve good selectivity for the
desired BHET with minimum quantities of starting materials employing
solvent-free condition to make the process green.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
Among all
of the catalysts, Zn–HT–glycine was the best for the
reaction, and hence its complete characterization was done. It is
recently published elsewhere29−31 (Supporting Information). Only a brief description is provided here.

2.1.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectrometry
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of Zn–HT–glycine at 1500, 2500, and 5000 amplification
are shown in Figure 1a–c, respectively. The average particle size is in the range
of 50–100 μm. It shows uneven particles, which are relatively
uniform in size. It is generally seen for materials synthesized by
the combustion method.

different
magnifications (a) 1500× (b) 2500× (c) 5000×.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) was
used to determine
the whole composition of titanium, zinc, aluminum, and magnesium for
all catalysts (Table 1). The ratio of composition of aluminum and magnesium was kept constant
as follows: (Al/Mg ratio of 1:3) in HT–glycerol, (Al/Mg ratio
of 1:2) in Ti–HT with glycine and glycerol as fuels, (Al/Mg
of 1:4) in Zn–HT with glycine and glycerol as fuels.

2.2.1 Efficacy of Different
Catalysts
Zn–HT–glycine, Zn–HT–glycerol,
Ti–HT–glycine,
Ti–HT–glycerol, and HT–glycerol were used (Figure 2) for the production
of BHET. It was observed that Zn–HT–glycine having mild
basicity as well as low acidity in comparison with other studied catalysts
showed the best results giving 64.6% conversion of DMT and 96.1% selectivity
toward BHET (Table 2).

Figure 2 Effect of different catalysts on the conversion of DMT. Reaction
conditions: DMT 0.12 mol, EG 0.24 mol, total volume 38.2 cm3, agitation speed 1000 rpm, catalyst loading 0.05 g/cm3, temperature 180 °C.

The results obtained under current investigation are better than
those reported in the published literature where the mole ratio of
DMT to EG was 1:20.7,8,15 In
the current case, it was 1:2 with DMT as the limiting reactant. A
blank reaction was conducted without use of any catalyst which showed
that the conversion was only 1.7% in 4 h.

For all above catalysts,
the conversion and selectivity were confirmed
by taking repeated runs to avoid errors and are averaged.

2.3 Effect of Speed of Agitation
Different
runs were conducted to study the influence of external mass-transfer
resistance on conversion at agitation speed from 800 to 1200 rpm (Figure 3). The conversion
increased only marginally with speed and it was practically the same
at 1000 and 12000 rpm. Thus, there were no significant effect of mass-transfer
resistance on rate of reaction and conversion. A theoretical calculation
was also done to find diffusion coefficients, solid–liquid
mass-transfer coefficients, and mass-transfer rates in comparison
with observed rate of reaction. The rate of mass transfer was very
high by an order of magnitude, and hence, there was no mass-transfer
resistance. The theoretical background and method of calculation are
given elsewhere.32,33 Thus, the subsequent runs were
carried out at 1000 rpm.

Figure 3 Effect of the speed of agitation on conversion
of DMT. Reaction
conditions: catalyst Zn–HT–glycine, DMT 0.12 mol, EG
0.24 mol, total volume 38.2 cm3, catalyst loading 0.05
g/cm3, temperature 180 °C.

2.4 Proof of Absence of External Mass-Transfer
Resistance
There are different controlling mechanisms as
reported in the literature for better understanding of solid–liquid
or heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The liquid phase diffusivity
of DMT (A) at 180 °C was calculated using Wilke–Chang
equation as 1.341 × 10–5 cm2/s.34 Afterward, considering the limiting value of
Sherwood number (ShA = kSL-A × dp/DAB) as 2, the mass-transfer coefficient was
evaluated as 3.831 × 10–3 cm/s. The particle
surface per unit liquid volume was obtained as 1  

The observed initial
rate of reaction
for DMT was calculated as, 3.03 × 10–5 mol
cm–3 s–1, while the mass-transfer
rate for DMT was evaluated as 6.6 × 10–4 mol
cm–3 s–1

As 2  that is, 3.29 × 104 ≫
1.5 × 103

Hence, it proved that there was no
external mass-transfer resistance
for the reaction. The only resistance could be due to intraparticle
diffusion, surface reaction, chemisorption, or desorption. It will
be discussed later.

2.5 Effect of Catalyst Loading
The catalyst
quantity was varied from 0.05 to 0.15 g/cm3 (Figure 4). The conversion of DMT was
found to increase with catalyst loading w (g/cm3). A plot was made for initial rate (dXA/dt) versus time which shows that the rate
of reaction is directly proportional to the number of available active
sites, that is, mass of the catalyst (Figure 5). The Weisz–Prater modulus was also
calculated to confirm the absence of intraparticle diffusion limitation
and the reaction was kinetically controlled.35

of catalyst loading on conversion of DMT. Reaction conditions:
catalyst Zn–HT–glycine, DMT 0.12 mol, EG 0.24 mol, total
volume 38.2 cm3, speed of agitation 1000 rpm, temperature

Reaction conditions:
catalyst Zn–HT–glycine, DMT 0.12 mol, EG 0.24 mol, total
volume 38.2 cm3, speed of agitation 1000 rpm, temperature
180 °C.

2.6 Proof
of Absence of Intraparticle Resistance
Considering 70 μm
as the average particle size of the catalyst
Zn–HT–glycine, theoretical calculations were performed
to calculate the Weisz–Prater criterion (Cwp).36 The details of these
methods are reported in the literature.37,38 The value
of Cwp thus obtained is 0.051 which is
far less than unity, confirming that the reaction was free from intraparticle
diffusion resistance. Thus, the reaction was kinetically controlled
which was further confirmed from the evaluation of apparent activation
energy as given in Section 2.10.

2.7 Effect of Mole Ratio
The molar concentration
of the limiting (DMT) to the excess reactant (EG) was varied from
1:1 to 1:3 at the same catalyst loading per unit volume (Figure 6). The initial rate
of reaction increased with concentration.

Figure 6 Effect of mole ratio
of DMT to EG. Reaction conditions: catalyst
Zn–HT–glycine, agitation speed 1000 rpm, catalyst loading
0.05 g/cm3, temperature 180 °C.

2.8 Effect of Temperature
Experiments
were conducted at different temperatures ranging from 150 to 190 °C
(Figure 7). Conversion
of DMT increased with temperature. This result indicates that the
reaction is controlled by kinetic step only, and mass-transfer and
intraparticle diffusion resistances do not play any role during the
reaction.

Figure 7 Effect of temperature on conversion of DMT. Reaction conditions:
catalyst Zn–HT–glycine, DMT 0.12 mol, EG 0.24 mol, total
volume 38.2 cm3, agitation speed 1000 rpm, catalyst loading
0.05 g/cm3.

Table 3 gives the
comparison of published research on transesterification of DMT with
EG for the synthesis of BHET including the current work. Both super
base catalysts, viz. CsxO/γ-Al2O3 and Na/NaOH/γ-Al2O3 resulted in to 88 and 90% selectivity of BHET, respectively, for
0.25 mol DMT per g of catalyst. However, Zn–HT–glycine
in the current work showed 96.1% selectivity toward BHET for 0.072
mol DMT per g of catalyst, which is 3.47 times less. Rest of the catalysts
listed in Table 4 are
homogeneous in nature. Thus, the current work gives more selectivity
toward BHET with the use of cheap heterogeneous base catalyst, Zn–HT–glycine,
with excellent selectivity at much lower DMT/EG molar ratio, less
DMT/catalyst ratio with reusable catalyst, and in solvent-free condition
to make the process green. The volume of reaction mass governs the
reaction rate.

2.9 Effect of Reusability of Catalyst
After each experiment, the catalyst was separated by filtration and
washed with 50 cm3 methanol to desorb any adsorbed material
from the catalyst pores and then dried at 120 °C. Generally,
there was a loss of ∼2 to 3% catalyst which was compensated
with a fresh catalyst (Figure 8). It was noticed that the catalyst activity and selectivity
reduced very marginally on repetitive use of the same catalyst. Further
experiments were done where no make up for the loss of catalyst during
filtration was done. However, the volume of the reaction mass was
reduced to maintain the same catalyst loading in g/cm3 and
the same mole of reactants/mass of the catalyst. The experimental
results were within ±2% proving that the activity was preserved.

2.10 Reaction Mechanism and Kinetic Model
A
kinetic model was developed for the transesterification reaction
in the absence of both external mass-transfer and intraparticle diffusion
resistances. Out of the many models tried, the following was observed
to fit the data reasonably well. In this reaction, chemisorption of
A (DMT) and B (EG) takes place on two nearby vacant sites S1 and S2, respectively, according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson
(LWHW) mechanism to give E (bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate)) and
F (methanol) (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Catalytic Cycle for the Transesterification Reaction Over Zn–HT–glycine
(S1—Acidic Sites, S2 Basic Sites)
Adsorption of DMT A on vacant sites S1 3  

Similarly, on another vacant site S2, EG is adsorbed
as 4  

In the next step, the surface reaction
of complexes takes place
giving ES1 and FS2 as follows 5  

Finally, desorption of complexes formed
ES1 and FS2 is represented by following reversible
reactions 6   7  

It gives regeneration of active sites S1 and S2.

If the surface reaction is the rate controlling step, then
the
rate of reaction of A is given by 8  

When the reaction is far away from
equilibrium 9  

Replacing with total
site concentration 10   11  

If w is the catalyst loading, then 12  

The adsorption constants K1, KA, KB, KE, and KF were calculated
using Polymath 6 and eq 12 (Table 4). Initial
concentration of DMT (CA0)
and EG (CB0) were taken as
3.63 and 7.27 mol L–1, respectively.

The values
of adsorption constants were observed to be very small
and hence, eq 11 leads
to 13  or 14  where 15  

Table 4 shows
that
the adsorption equilibrium constants are negligible, leading to a
power law model.

If the initial molar ratio of EG and DMT is  at time t = 0, then eq 14 reduces to a typical
second-order equation which can be integrated in terms of fractional
conversion XA of A as follows 16  

For a fixed
catalyst loading w and initial concentration
of A, the pseudo-constant can be written as 17  

Thus, plots of  versus t were made at
different temperatures at fixed w and CA0 (Figure 9) which are straight lines passing through origin.
It confirms that reaction is second order and validates the mathematical
model. The slopes of these lines at various temperatures were used
to make the Arrhenius plot (Figure 10). The apparent activation energy was obtained to be
9.64 kcal/mol which established that the reaction rate was controlled
by intrinsic kinetics.

3 Conclusions
Different basic zinc- and
titanium-loaded HT catalysts were prepared
by using the combustion synthesis method with glycerol and glycine
as fuels. The effect of combustion fuel was noticed in the activity
of the catalysts which were fully characterized and used in transesterification
reaction of DMT with EG to synthesize bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate.
Zn–HT–glycine was observed to be the best catalyst which
showed better stability, activity, and selectivity. A mechanism was
proposed and kinetics were thoroughly deduced using LHHW model. It
was observed that all species are weakly adsorbed leading to the second-order
rate equation having activation energy 9.64 kcal/mol. The current
reaction was carried out with a novel cheaper zinc-modified HT as
the catalyst for the first time to give good selectivity without any
use of solvent to make the process green and sustainable. Comparison
with the earlier literature shows that the catalyst and process conditions
are superior to the previously reported research.

which was used as fuel in the least amount of water. The Al and Mg
nitrate ratio was kept at 1:3. Surplus water was removed by heating
the mixture at 80 °C in a crucible. It resulted in to a thick
paste which was then placed into a preheated muffle furnace at 500
°C, leading to spontaneous combustion. The solid puffy material
after spontaneous combustion was calcined at 650 °C for 3 h.24,25Table 5 gives the

4.3 Reaction Setup and Procedure
The
transesterification reaction was conducted in a standard cylindrical
glass reactor of 100 mL volume with four baffles, overhead stirrer,
and reflux condenser. The stirrer was a 45° pitched blade turbine
impeller connected to a speed regulator. The reactor was kept in a
thermostatic oil bath to maintain the desired temperature. In a typical
run, 0.12 mol DMT and 0.24 mol EG were introduced in the reactor.
The total volume was 38.2 cm3, No solvent was used. The
reaction mixture was heated to 180 °C at 1000 rpm. The catalyst
loading was 0.05 g/cm3 of total reaction volume. Sampling
was done periodically. At the end, the catalyst was removed from the
reaction mixture by centrifugation. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (Agilent technologies 1260 infinity) was used with C-18 mid-polar
capillary column (0.25 mm ID, 30 m), and the reaction progress was
monitored. Acetonitrile was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate
of 1.0 mL/min. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
(PerkinElmer Clarus 500) with capillary column Elite −1 (30
m, 0.25 mm ID) was used for product confirmation. DMT (limiting reactant)
conversion was determined.

4.4 Analytical Method
Sampling was done
at periodic intervals by reducing the speed of agitation to zero and
allowing the catalyst to settle at the bottom of the reactor. Clear
liquid samples were prepared by centrifuging them for 5 min. The sample
(20 μL) was diluted in a 10 mL standard volumetric flask using
the mobile phase. Analysis of the samples was performed over HPLC
(Agilent Technology 1260 infinity; autosampler); Hiplex-H column (300
× 7.7 mm, particle size 8 μm; 55 °C column oven temperature,
UV–Vis detector at 210 nm, RID at 55 °C cell temperature).
A mobile phase of acetonitrile: water (1:1 v/v with 0.1% orthophosphoric
acid) solution was used at a flow rate of 1 cm3/min. Fifteen
microliter injector volumes were used in the autosampler. Products
were confirmed by using GC–MS. The rates and conversions were
based on the disappearance of DMT. The conversion of DMT and selectivity
to the main product BHET were calculated by HPLC analysis is as follows  where A0 and Ai are
the area of DMT at time t = 0 and t = i, respectively.

The selectivity was calculated
as  where Ad is the
area of the desired BHET product and Ai is the total area of all the products formed in
the reaction.

4.5 Catalyst Characterization
All five
catalysts were characterized by EDXS (JOEL JSM 6308LA analytical scanning
microscope) using 10 kV voltage at a counting rate 519 cps and energy
range of 0–20 keV. SEM images were procured at different amplifications.
The textural analysis of catalysts was achieved by nitrogen adsorption
using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. 10% v/v CO2 in
He and 10% v/v NH3 in He temperature programmed desorption (TPD) (micromeritics Autochem
II 2920) using TCD detector were used to determine basic and acidic
site densities of the catalyst, respectively. A Bruker AXS diffractometer
D8 advance Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540562) was used to
obtain the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of catalysts.
