The present study reports the synthesis
of polycarbazole (PCz)-decorated
TiO2 nanohybrids via in situ chemical polymerization of
carbazole monomers in TiO2 dispersions. The ratio of the
polymer in the nanohybrid varied between 0.5 and 2 wt %. The synthesized
nanohybrids were characterized using infrared and diffuse reflectance
spectroscopies, whereas the morphology was analyzed using X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. XRD revealed
changes in the peak corresponding to the d(001) plane
of TiO2 owing to the interaction between the two components.
TEM confirmed the formation of PCz-decorated nanohybrids. Amido Black
10B (AB-10B) was chosen as a model dye for the degradation studies.
Sonophotocatalytic degradation of the dye was studied by varying the
catalyst and dye concentrations. Results showed that PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids exhibited a complete degradation of AB-10B dye within
a short span of 60–90 min, which was faster than pure TiO2 and the reported decorated TiO2 nanohybrids synthesized
by other authors. The degraded dye fragments were identified using
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LCMS). By varying
the loading of PCz in TiO2, the nanohybrids could be tuned
to achieve visible light-driven degradation.

1 Introduction
Semiconductor-mediated
photocatalysis is one of the widely adopted
techniques for the degradation of dyes and organic pollutants in water.1−5 The key function of this method is to generate species such as hydroxyl
radicals (•OH) and superoxide radicals (O2•–) that can degrade the organic compounds in the dye waste water into
harmless byproducts.6−10 One of the major limitations of utilizing TiO2 as a photocatalyst
is its high rate of recombination of holes and electrons owing to
its wide band gap of ∼3.2 eV.11,12 As this band
gap corresponds to the wavelength of 387 nm, hardly 4% of the solar
energy is utilized for the degradation of organic pollutants. Therefore,
pristine TiO2 is economically unattractive as a photocatalyst
for waste water remediation.13,14 Several strategies
have been employed to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 such as increasing the catalyst surface to volume ratio,
sensitization of the catalyst using polymers, doping of the catalyst
with nonmetals such as nitrogen and carbon, and impregnation of metal
ions/transition metals.15−20 Lately, researchers have focused on combining semiconductor oxide
nanoparticles with conducting polymers to achieve synergetic properties.21−24 Conducting polymers, such as polyaniline,6 poly(1-naphthylamine),21 and so forth,
provide moderate to high mobility of charge carriers via the extended
π-conjugated electron system that can be electronically coupled
to TiO2, so as to facilitate a better separation of photoinduced
charges in the semiconductor oxide. Conducting polymers are also known
to act as sensitizers when combined with semiconductor nanoparticles
to prevent the electron–hole recombination.25 Among the several conducting polymers, polycarbazole (PCz)
has been proved to be an exceptionally efficient polymer owing to
its high electrical conductivity, thermal stability, low band gap,
and low toxicity.26−30 It has been widely used in designing solar devices and organic light-emitting
diodes.31−35

With a view to explore the photocatalytic efficiency of PCz,
the
present study reports the sonolytic synthesis of PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids using different weight ratios of the conducting polymer.
The nanohybrids were characterized by FTIR, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) techniques. To the best of our knowledge, the photocatalytic
performance of PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids is reported for the
first time. Amido Black 10B (AB-10B) was chosen as a model dye because
it is widely used in staining proteins and is reported to be highly
toxic.36 The photocatalytic activity of
the nanohybrids was evaluated by varying the catalyst and dye concentration
upon exposure to UV irradiation for a period of 60 min. The degraded
fragments were identified using the liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LCMS) technique, and a plausible mechanism for the efficient
photocatalytic performance was proposed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Confirmation of Nanohybrid
Formation by IR
Studies
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of pristine
PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids are shown in Figure 1. The IR spectrum of pure PCz
revealed two NH stretching vibration peaks at 3416 and 3045 cm–1. The imine stretching peak was observed at 1780 cm–1. The peaks corresponding to quinonoid and benzenoid
units were noticed at 1597 and 1491 cm–1, respectively.29,37−39 The benzenoid to quinonoid (B/Q) ratio in this case
was observed to be 0.91, indicating the formation of equal number
of benzenoid and quinonoid units. The CN stretching peak was observed
at 1232 cm–1, whereas the peaks at 921, 850, and
752 cm–1 were correlated with the presence of unsubstituted
carbazole, confirming that polymerization took place from 3 to 6 positions.40 The IR spectrum of PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1)
showed a broad NH stretching vibration peak around 3309 cm–1. The broadness of the peak was correlated with the interaction of
NH of PCz with oxygen of TiO2.37−39 The peak at
667 cm–1 was correlated with the presence of TiO2 and appeared to be broad, whereas the peaks corresponding
to PCz appeared to be diminished owing to the lower loading of the
polymer in this nanohybrid.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of pure PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids.

In the case of PCz/TiO2 (1:1), NH stretching vibration
peaks were noticed at 3416 and 3045 cm–1, whereas
the imine stretching peak was observed around 1780 cm–1. The quinonoid and benzenoid units were observed at 1597 and 1491
cm–1, respectively. The peak associated with TiO2 appeared at 675 cm–1. The NH stretching
vibration peaks for PCz/TiO2 (2:1) were noticed at 3416
and 3047 cm–1, whereas the imine stretching peak
was observed at 1780 cm–1. The peaks corresponding
to quinonoid and benzenoid units were noticed at 1599, 1448, and 1394
cm–1. The B/Q ratio was calculated to be 1.04. It
can therefore be concluded that with the increase in the loading of
PCz, slight changes were noticed in the IR spectra of the nanohybrids.
Similar observations have also been reported by other authors.29 However, the NH stretching vibration peak revealed
a significant shift in the case of PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1). With
the increase in the loading of PCz in TiO2, the shift was
observed to decrease owing to the encapsulation of TiO2 by PCz. The % transmittance was also found to decrease with the
increase in the loading of PCz. The lowest intensity was noticed for
PCz/TiO2 (2:1), whereas the highest intensity was observed
for PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1). The weight average molecular weight
(M̅w) of pure PCz was calculated
to be 3582 Da, which confirmed the polymerization of carbazole.41 Conductivity was found to be 2.65 × 10–4 S/cm. The conductivities of PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1),
PCz/TiO2 (1:1), and PCz/TiO2 (2:1) were obtained
as 1.13 × 10–4, 1.75 × 10–4, and 2.12 × 10–4 S/cm, respectively.

2.2 Analysis of Electronic Transitions and Band
Gap Energy PCz and PCz/TiO2 Nanohybrids via DRS
The diffuse reflectance spectrum of pure TiO2 (Figure 2a) revealed a sharp
absorption edge around 390 nm, which could be well-correlated with
the anatase form of TiO2. The diffuse reflectance spectrum
of pure PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids showed absorption
edge around 410 nm. The peak intensity was observed to be the lowest
for PCz/TiO2 (2:1) but was found to be higher for PCz/TiO2 (1:1) and matched with that of pure PCz.

Figure 2 (a) UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra (DRS) of TiO2, PCz, and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids and Kubelka–Munk
plot of (b) PCz and (c) TiO2.

The Kubelka–Munk42 equation
is
generally applied to calculate the band gap of semiconductors which
is given by  where F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function, “R” is reflectance of the sample, “α”
is
the absorption coefficient, and “s”
is the scattering coefficient. The scattering coefficient, s, is ignored on the basis of wavelength dependence, thereby
making F(R) proportional to α.
Tauc, Davis, and Mott proposed an equation to calculate the band gap
of semiconductors using the absorption coefficient given by the expression43,44  where α is the adsorption coefficient, h is the Planck’s constant, ν is the vibrational
frequency, and Eg is the band gap. The
value of n is taken to be 2 for indirect band semiconductors.
By substituting the value of n and α = F(R) in the above equation, the band gap
was calculated, as shown in Figure 2b. The band gap energy of pristine TiO2 was
calculated to be 3.2 eV, whereas that of pure PCz was calculated as
2.95 eV (Figure 2b).

2.3 Morphological Analysis of TiO2,
PCz, and PCz/TiO2 Nanohybrids via XRD and TEM Studies
The XRD profiles of PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids are
depicted in Figure 3. The XRD patterns of anatase TiO2 (inset) revealed peaks
at 2θ = 25.5°, 38.2°, 48.3°, 54.2°, 55.4°,
62.5°, 68.2°, 70.7°, and 75.5° corresponding to d(101), d(004), d(200), d(105), d(211), d(204), d(116), d(220), and d(215)
planes, respectively. The peaks were found to match with the tetragonal
anatase form of TiO2 showing cell constants as a = b = 0.37710 nm, c =
0.9430 nm, and α = β = γ = 90°, which was found
to be in agreement with the standard diffraction data (JCPDS 21-1272).45 The XRD profile of pure PCz revealed peaks at
2θ = 18.50°, 19°, 19.5°, 22.5°, 23°,
and 28° exhibiting high crystallinity as found in our previous
studies.46 The nanohybrids revealed a slight
shift in the crystalline peaks as well as variation in their intensities
upon nanohybrid formation. The PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) nanohybrid
revealed peaks at 2θ = 19°, 19.5°, 22.5°, 23.2°,
and 28°. The intensity of the peaks corresponding to PCz appeared
to be highly reduced upon the addition of TiO2. The peak
observed around 2θ = 25.3° was correlated with the d(101) plane of TiO2. Upon further increasing
the loading of PCz to 1 wt % (Figure 3), the intensity of the peaks appeared to increase.
For PCz/TiO2 (2:1), the peaks corresponding to PCz showed
the highest intensity. However, the peak correlated to TiO2 revealed the highest intensity for PCz/TiO2 (1:1). The
presence of the peaks corresponding to both PCz and TiO2 confirmed the formation of the nanohybrid. The variation in the
intensity of the peak corresponding to d(101) plane
of TiO2 confirmed its encapsulation by PCz (Table 1). The area under the peak corresponding
to the d(101) plane of TiO2 was found
to increase with the increase in the loading of PCz while the crystallite
size also showed a slight variation. Hence, it can be concluded that
an intense synergistic interaction was found to exist between PCz
and TiO2 because the peak corresponding to TiO2 revealed variations in the area as well as intensity upon loading
of PCz.

Figure 3 XRD of PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids.

Table 1 XRD Data of PCz and PCz/TiO2 Nanohybrids
nanohybrids	peak (2θ)	area peak	height (au)	fwhm (2θ)	crystallite

pure TiO2	25.5	947	741	0.220	6.97	
PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1)	25.3	1659	1205	0.194	7.90

PCz/TiO2 (2:1)	25.2	2118	1031	0.190	8.06	
The morphology of pure PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids
is shown in Figure 4a–d. The TEM of pure PCz revealed a mixed morphology of cubes
as well as hexagonal particles (Figure 4a). The TEM of the PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) nanohybrid
(Figure 4b) revealed
a fused distorted morphology in which the dense TiO2 particles
were noticed to be surrounded by the PCz nanoparticles. The TEM of
the PCz/TiO2 (1:1) nanohybrid (Figure 4c) exhibited huge clusters of distorted core–shell-like
morphology, whereas the PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrid (Figure 4d) showed the formation
of flowerlike clusters containing dense TiO2 particles
surrounded by PCz petals. The TiO2 particles appeared to
be decorated with PCz in the case of PCz/TiO2 (1:1) and
PCz/TiO2 (2:1)47 nanohybrids.
The morphology clearly revealed the synergistic interaction of PCz
with TiO2. The results were in agreement with the XRD studies
that showed intact crystalline morphology of the two components. Hence,
it can be confirmed that TiO2 particles are encapsulated
with the PCz chain, leading to the formation of self-assembled structures.

2.4 Variation of Thermal Stability of PCz and
Its Nanohybrids
The thermal stabilities of PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids were analyzed by TGA studies. The thermogram
of pure PCz (Figure 5) revealed 10 wt % loss at 200 °C, whereas 20 wt % loss occurred
at 310 °C. The initial weight loss of around 10 wt % was attributed
to the presence of unreacted monomers. Almost 60 wt % loss was noticed
at 480 °C, whereas 95 wt % loss took place at 830 °C. The
PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) nanohybrid revealed 10 wt % loss around
250 °C, whereas 62 wt % loss was noticed at 830 °C. The
thermal stability was found to be slightly enhanced. The thermogram
of the PCz/TiO2 (1:1) nanohybrid revealed 10 wt % loss
at 260 °C, whereas 50 wt % loss took place around 830 °C.
Similarly, the PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrid showed 10 wt %
loss at 260 °C, whereas 30 wt % loss occurred at 830 °C.
With the increase in the loading of PCz in TiO2, the thermal
stability was found to remarkably improve. The thermal stability of
PCz/TiO2 was noticed to be far superior to that of pure
PCz and was found to be in the order PCz/TiO2 (2:1) >
PCz/TiO2 (1:1) > PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) > PCz.

2.5 Evaluation of Photocatalytic Properties of
PCz and PCz/TiO2 Nanohybrids
The specific surface
area plays a major role in photocatalysis as it leads to an increased
catalytic activity. In our case, the specific surface area of pure
PCz and PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrids was found to be 236.226
and 281.321 m2/g, respectively. The measured pore volume
for PCz and PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrids was calculated to
be 0.190 and 0.213 cc/g, respectively (given in the Supporting Information, Figure S1). The photocatalytic activity
of the nanohybrids was evaluated using AB-10B dye. The UV–visible
spectrum of AB-10B revealed a prominent peak at 618 nm and two small
peaks at 226 and 318 nm (Figure 6a).

Figure 6 UV–visible spectra of (a) AB-10B dye (b) in the
presence
of PCz as a catalyst, (c) in the presence of PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1)
as a catalyst, (d) in the presence of PCz/TiO2 (1:1) as
a catalyst, and (e) in the presence PCz/TiO2 (2:1) as a
catalyst.

A prominent peak at 618 nm in
the visible region was observed owing
to the presence of an azo group, whereas the peaks in the ultraviolet
region were assigned to π–π* transition of the
aromatic benzene group.48,49 The degradation profile
of pristine PCz (Figure 6b) revealed negligible change during 60 min exposure time. However,
in the presence of the PCz/TiO2 nanohybrid, the peaks at
617 and 330 nm revealed a large decrease in the absorption intensity,
indicating a complete degradation of AB-10B under similar experimental
conditions (Figure 6c–e). Among the three nanohybrids, PCz/TiO2 (1:1)
and PCz/TiO2 (2:1) revealed the complete degradation of
AB-10B dye within a short span of 90 min. To study the effect of catalyst
concentration, degradation of 90 ppm AB-10B dye solution was carried
out using 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg of the nanohybrid as catalyst for
a period of 60 min (Figure 7a,b). The PCz/TiO2 (1:0.5) nanohybrid revealed
100 wt % degradation of 50 ppm dye solution when the catalyst concentration
was 300 mg, whereas 75 wt % degradation was achieved when the catalyst
concentration was 100 mg (Figure 7a,b). Similarly, PCz/TiO2 (1:1) and PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrids revealed almost 96 wt % degradation in
the case of 50 ppm of AB-10B dye solution, when the catalyst amount
was 50 mg (Figure 7b). It can thus be concluded that the degradation efficiency was
found to be high even at lower loading of the catalyst.

Figure 7 Effect of catalyst
concentration on the percent degradation for
(a) 50 ppm dye solution and (b) 90 ppm dye solution.

The C/Co plots of
the nanohybrids were studied using different catalyst concentrations
in 90 ppm AB-10B dye solution (Figure 8a–c). When 300 and 200 mg of PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) nanohybrid was used as the catalyst, almost 75 and 70 wt
% degradation was achieved in 60 min, whereas 65 wt % degradation
was achieved when 100 mg catalyst was used (Figure 8a). Similarly, the PCz/TiO2 (1:1)
nanohybrid (Figure 8b) showed 65–75 wt % degradation when the catalyst amount
was increased from 50 to 300 mg, whereas the degradation increased
from 65 to 90 wt % for the PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrid using
the same amount of catalyst (Figure 8c). The plots confirmed that the nanohybrids containing
higher PCz loading exhibited higher degradation efficiency even when
used in small amounts. Upon increasing the concentration of the AB-10B
dye solution from 30 to 120 ppm using a fixed catalyst amount of 150
mg, it was observed that 87 and 85 wt % degradation was achieved for
30 and 70 ppm dye solutions, respectively, using the PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) nanohybrid as the catalyst (Figure 9a–c). The PCz/TiO2 (1:1)
nanohybrid showed 90 and 80 wt % degradation in 60 min for 30 ppm
and 70 ppm dye solutions, respectively, whereas 120 ppm dye solution
showed 60 wt % degradation in 60 min (Figure 9b). Around 90 wt % degradation occurred when
the PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrid was used as the catalyst
for 120 ppm AB-10B dye solution (Figure 9c). It can thus be concluded that the nanohybrid
containing 2 wt % PCz revealed degradation efficiency (as high as
80 wt %) for the degradation of 120 ppm AB-10B dye solution.

PCz/TiO2 (1:0.5) (inset ln C/Co), (b) PCz/TiO2 (1:1) (inset ln C/Co), and (c) PCz/TiO2 (2:1)
(inset ln C/Co).

The plots of ln C/Co versus time (Figure 9a–c, insets) showed that degradation
kinetics followed the
pseudo first-order kinetics in all cases. When PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) was used as the catalyst, the rate constant (k) was observed to be 0.027 min–1 for 30 ppm dye
solution, whereas for 120 ppm dye solution, it was noticed to be 0.010
min–1. Similarly for the catalyst, PCz/TiO2 (1:1), the rate constant (k) decreased from 0.057
min–1 for 30 ppm dye solution to 0.015 min–1 for 120 ppm, whereas for PCz/TiO2 (2:1), the rate constant
decreased from 0.090 to 0.038 min–1. Sivakumar et
al.48 carried out the degradation of AB-10B
dye using metal-decorated TiO2 nanohybrids, and the rate
constant values reported by them are shown in Table 2. The degradation time in our case was observed
to be 60 min, whereas the authors have carried out the degradation
for a period of 7 h. These observations clearly highlight the photocatalytic
efficiency of PCz-decorated TiO2 nanohybrids.

2.6 Proposed Degradation Pathway and Analysis
of Degraded Dye Fragments by the LCMS Technique
Although
PCz failed to degrade the dye under UV–visible irradiation,
the PCz/TiO2 nanohybrid was noticed to rapidly degrade
the dye molecules under similar conditions. A plausible explanation
for this behavior is depicted in Scheme 1. Low band gap of PCz facilitates high electron-hole
recombination in the absence of metal oxide. When PCz/TiO2 is illuminated under UV light, it promotes the transfer of electrons
from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of PCz molecules into
the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 which reacts with oxygen
and hydroxyl radicals present at the surface. The CB of PCz is lower
than that of TiO2, and hence it acts like a sink for the
photogenerated electrons. The holes move in the opposite direction
from the electrons, and the photogenerated holes in PCz get trapped
within the TiO2 particles. In this way, the charge carrier
recombination is reduced, and more charge carriers are available for
the production of free radicals through interfacial charge transfer
(Scheme 1). Radical-trapping
experiments were conducted using benzoquinone as a superoxide anion
radical scavenger and tert-butanol as a hydroxyl
radical (given in the Supporting Information, Figure S2). The concentration of AB-10B dye solution was found
to decrease drastically in the presence of 2 mM t-BuOH and pure TiO2, whereas the concentration decreased
slightly using 2 mM benzoquinone.15,16 However, when
the PCz/TiO2 nanohybrid was used with the radical scavengers,
the concentration of the AB-10B dye solution decreased drastically
in the presence of benzoquinone, whereas the concentration changed
slightly in the presence of t-BuOH. This behavior
confirmed that •OH radicals were the active species that participated
in the degradation of AB-10B dye solution when PCz/TiO2 nanohybrid was used as the catalyst.

Scheme 1 Mechanism of Radical
Generation in (a) PCz and (b) PCz/TiO2 Nanohybrids
Degradation of Amido Black
was confirmed by LCMS studies which
revealed a variety of intermediate compounds formed during the course
of the reaction (Scheme 2a). The intermediates with their increasing m/z values are shown in Scheme 2b. Around 100% abundance was assigned to the first
intermediate that was taken as the main degradation product. Intermediates
of 100% abundance with low m/z values
ranging from 100 to 70 were obtained. They were labeled as G-1, G-2,
G-3, G-4, and G-5. The first intermediate G-1 (m/z 540) showed 100% abundance and was taken as the main degradation
product. Intermediates with m/z values
393 (80%), 291 (70%), 269 (83%), and 189 (100%) were obtained. These
intermediates revealed that the degradation proceeded via elimination
of azo and sulphonate groups, attacked by •OH free radicals.
Interestingly, the dye degradation proceeded by the cleavage of the
−N=N– group, owing to easy breakdown of π
bond, bearing the unsubstituted phenyl ring. The •OH radicals
preferentially attacked the electron-rich diazo functionality of the
molecule to form sodium 4-amino-6-diazenyl-5-hydroxy-3-((4-nitrophenyl)diazenyl)naphthalene-2,7-disulfonate
(G-1, m/z 540). The attack of •OH
radicals produced sodium 3,4,6-triamino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonate
(G-2, m/z 393). This fragment then
degraded into sodium 3,4,6-triamino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonate
(G-3, m/z 291). Accordingly, 3,4,6-triamino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic
acid (G-4, m/z 269) was obtained
from the G-3 fragment. The degradation product G-5 was formed by the
cleavage of the sulphonate group from the G-4 fragment (Scheme 2(a)).

3 Conclusions
PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids
were successfully prepared via
in situ chemical polymerization using the ultrasonic technique. XRD
and TEM analyses confirmed the interaction between PCz chains and
TiO2 nanoparticles. The thermal stability of PCz/TiO2 was noticed to be far superior than that of pure PCz and
was found to be in the order PCz/TiO2 (2:1) > PCz/TiO2 (1:1) > PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1) > PCz. PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids exhibited good photocatalytic activity as compared
to
pristine TiO2, whereas PCz revealed no activity. Almost
100% degradation of AB-10B dye was achieved in the presence of PCz/TiO2 nanohybrid. LCMS studies confirmed the degradation of dye
into fragments of low-molecular-weight compounds. Thus, by varying
the loading of PCz in TiO2, the band gap of the nanohybrid
could be modified and tuned to achieve visible light-driven photocatalysis.
Overall, the nanohybrid was found to hold immense potential to be
used as an efficient photocatalyst for waste water remediation. Studies
on the degradation of other organic pollutants using this nanohybrid
are under progress and will be published soon.

4 Materials
and Methods
Amido Black-10B (AB-10B) dye was procured from
S.D. Fine Chem.
Pvt. Ltd., India and used without further purification. Carbazole
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA), ferric chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), titanium(IV)
oxide (anatase ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Merck, India) were also used without further
purification.

4.1 Synthesis of PCz
Carbazole monomer
(2.5 g, 0.014 mol) was added to a 250 mL conical flask containing
methanol and water 1:1 v/v (50 mL each). Ferric chloride (2.7 g, 0.016
mol) was added as the initiator to the reaction mixture kept in an
ultrasonicator maintained at 30 °C. The color of the solution
changed from dusty gray to light yellow, indicating rapid polymerization
of the monomer.37 The reaction was carried
out for 2 h. The synthesized PCz was then taken out and washed several
times with distilled water/methanol on a Buchner funnel. PCz was then
dried in a vacuum oven for 72 h at 70 °C for the complete removal
of water and impurities.

4.2 Synthesis of PCz/TiO2 Nanohybrids
For the synthesis of 2:1 TiO2/PCz nanohybrid, carbazole
monomer (3 g, 0.017 mol) and TiO2 (1.6 g, 0.020 mol) were
added together in a 250 mL conical flask containing methanol and water
(1:1 v/v; 50 mL each). Ferric chloride (3.2 g, 0.019 mol) was added
to the reaction mixture keeping the monomer/initiator ratio to be
1:1. The flask was kept on an ultrasonicator maintained at 30 °C,
and the reaction was carried out for 6 h. The synthesized PCz nanohybrid
was then washed several times with distilled water and ethanol and
dried in vacuum for 72 h at 80 °C to ensure the complete removal
of water. A similar procedure was adopted for the synthesis of 1:1
and 0.5:1 nanohybrids, and they were designated as PCz/TiO2 (0.5:1), PCz/TiO2 (1:1), and PCz/TiO2 (2:1)
based on the wt % loading of PCz in TiO2.

4.3 Photocatalytic Activity
A stock solution
of 500 ppm AB-10B dye solution was prepared by dissolving 500 mg of
AB-10B dye in 1 L of deionized water. To study the effect of dye concentration,
solutions of AB-10B dye of 120 mg/L, 90 mg/L, 70 mg/L (mg), and 50
mg/L were prepared by the dilution of 500 mg/L stock solution and
were designated as AB-10B-120, AB-10B-90, AB-10B-70, and AB-10B-50,
respectively. Fixed catalyst amount (150 mg) was taken with 200 mL
of dye solution prior to UV irradiation, and the suspension was stirred
for 30 min and kept under dark conditions (for 24 h) to establish
the equilibrium. Photocatalytic experiments were performed under UV
irradiation in a photochemical reactor (model LELESIL), fitted with
a UV lamp of LP 400 W, lamp arc: 125 mm with built in resistor, and
wavelength spectrum: 200–1100 nm. The lamp was switched on
to initiate the photocatalytic degradation reaction. The dye solutions
were exposed to UV irradiation, and aliquots (2 mL) of the dye solution
were taken out at regular intervals of 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and
centrifuged for 10 min at a speed of 5000 rpm and analyzed using a
UV–visible spectrophotometer model Shimadzu UV 1800 at λmax of AB-10B dye (618 nm). To study the effect of catalyst
concentration, different concentrations of the nanohybrid (50, 100,
200, and 300 mg) were used for degrading 90 ppm AB-10B dye solution.
A calibration plot based on Beer–Lambert’s law was obtained
by plotting the absorbance against the concentration of dye in solution
to determine the quantity of the dye degraded after different intervals
of time. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and the deviation
from the mean value of the concentration of the dye at any time was
shown by error bars. For kinetics analysis, the degradation data were
plotted in Origin 8.0 software. Out of the graphs plotted for different
rate laws, ln C/Co, versus
time gave the best fit data as the R2 value
was observed to be higher than 0.995. The slope showed the rate constant
value obtained using different nanohybrids as catalysts. Radical-trapping
experiments were conducted to identify the radicals involved in the
degradation of AB-10B dye solution using benzoquinone (O2•– radical scavenger) and tert-butanol (•OH radical scavenger). The nanohybrid (2 mg) along
with the scavenger (5 mL, 2 mM) was added to 50 mL of AB-10B dye solution
(50 mg L–1) and was sonicated together for 3 h in
the dark to reach adsorption equilibrium. The samples were sonolytically
irradiated under UV light. The suspensions were separated at fixed
time intervals by centrifugation, and the decrease in the concentration
of AB-10B dye solution was measured by taking the UV–vis spectra.

4.4 Instrumentation and Characterization
Molecular
weight mass determination was done using the Viscotek GPCmax
autosampler system consisting of a pump, a Viscotek UV detector, and
a Viscotek differential refractive index detector. A ViscoGEL GPC
column 151 (G2000HHR) (7.8 mm internal diameter, 300 mm length) was
used. The effective molecular weight range of the column used was
456–42 800, and tetrahydrofuran was used as an eluant
at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 30 °C. Analysis of the data was
done using Viscotek OmniSEC Omni-01 software. Conductivity was measured
in a pellet form on a Keithley multimeter model DMM 2001 via four
probe method. FT-IR spectra of the nanohybrid were taken in the form
of KBR pellets on an FT-IR spectrophotometer model Shimadzu IRA Affinity-1.
Diffuse reflectance spectra were taken on a UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer with an integrated spherical detector (UV-2501PC,
Shimadzu, Japan) in the range of 200–800 nm. XRD profiles of
the nanohybrid were recorded on a Philips PW 3710 powder diffractometer
(nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiations). Peak parameters were analyzed
using Origin 8.0 software. Transmission electron micrographs were
taken on Morgagni 268-D TEM, FEI, USA, operated at an accelerated
voltage of 120 kV. The thermal stability of PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids was investigated by TGA using a thermal analyzer STA
6000, PerkinElmer. The samples were heated from 30 to 850 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in N2 atmosphere at
a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The specific surface area of PCz and PCz/TiO2 nanohybrids was analyzed via nitrogen adsorption isotherms
(78 K) using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
The pore size distributions of PCz and PCz/TiO2 (2:1) nanohybrids
were derived from the absorption isotherms by using the BET surface
area analyzer, Nova Station 2000e, Quantachrome Instruments Limited,
USA, using the multiple-point BET method. For the detection and identification
of degradation products, LCMS was conducted using a Waters Xevo G2-S
TOF, USA, mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization
interface source and operated in the negative polarity mode fitted
with BEH C18 (1.7 × 50 mm) containing 2.1 packed particles. Acetonitrile
and Milli-Q water containing 0.1% formic acid, pH 2.7, were used as
eluants. The experiments were carried out in triplicate for evaluating
the effect of nanohybrid catalyst dosage and AB-10B dye concentration.
