In this work, we designed and synthesized
a special axle guest
hexyldimethyl(ferrocenylmethyl)ammonium (1+) bromide. The binding interactions of 1+ and its oxidized form 12+ with cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) and cyclohexanocucurbit[6]uril
(Cy6Q[6]) were investigated by 1H NMR, cyclic voltammogram,
and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques. Our data indicate
that both hosts Cy6Q[6] and Q[7] can form stable [2]pseudorotaxanes
with 1+ in their different redox
states. Most importantly, the combination and dissociation of the
hosts with the guest as well as the binding location can be controlled
by electrochemical means, which develops a special molecular switch
and selector.

Introduction
Interlocked
molecules are of research interest because they hold
promise for constructing pseudorotaxanes, rotaxanes, catenanes, and
other molecular machines.1−3 In most cases, a molecular machine
contains two component parts, a mobile macrocycle “wheel”
and a long “axle”, in which relative positions can be
controlled by the changes of pH values,4 photochemical processes,5 and electrochemical
oxidation states.6 In the past two decades,
a large number of macrocycles, such as crown ethers, cyclodextrins,
metallocycles, calixarenes, and pillar[n]arenes,
have been utilized as wheels to fabricate molecular machines.7

Cucurbit[n]urils8 (n = 5–8, 10, and 14,
here after abbreviated as Q[n]) are an important
class of macrocycles, featuring a relatively
rigid hydrophobic cavity and two identical carbonyl-laced portals.
From the structural point of view, Q[n]s seem excellent
macrocycles for constructing molecular machines. In fact, exciting
examples of Q[n]s-based molecular switches and machines
have been reported by Kaifer,9 Liu,10 Sun,11 and other
groups.12 In particular, Kaifer demonstrated
switchable cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])-based pseudorotaxanes, in which
the combination and dissociation of the Q[7] wheel with the ferrocenyl
residue of the axle can be controlled via redox coversions.9a In our previous work, we systematically investigated
the binding interactions between the cyclohexanocucurbit[6]uril (Cy6Q[6], Figure 1) and a series of
dialkyl-4,4′-bipyridinium.13 The
results have shown that the aliphatic chain of the guest presents
a high binding affinity of over 105 with Cy6Q[6] at room
temperature.

Figure 1 Molecular structures of the hosts Cy6Q[6] and Q[7] and
the guests 1+ and 12+ used in this study.

Therefore, we are motivated to design and synthesize a special
axle guest, hexyldimethyl(ferrocenylmethyl)ammonium bromide (1+Br–, Figure 1), which is prepared
by the reaction of dimethyl(ferrocenylmethyl)amine with hexyl bromide.
Because the axle guest 1+ contains
both ferrocenyl and aliphatic chain units, it can bind with Q[7] and
Cy6Q[6], respectively, to form the corresponding pseudorotaxanes in
theory. In this work, however, our particular interest is to control
the binding affinities of the axle guest 1+ with the Q[7] and Cy6Q[6] wheel host by the electrochemical
means and to construct a special molecular switch and molecular selector.

Results
and Discussion
First, we investigated the host–guest
interactions of the
Q[7] and Cy6Q[6] hosts with the guest 1+ by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Figure 2A shows the 1H NMR spectra of
guest 1+, in which peak assignment
is supported by two-dimensional (2D) COrrelation SpectroscopY (COSY)
experiments (Figure S1 in Supporting Information
(SI)). Upon addition of 1.1 equiv of Cy6Q[6], the alkyl protons shifted
upfield about 0.15–1.01 ppm from the resonances of the free 1+. In contrast, the ferrocene protons
shifted downfield slightly. These chemical shifts indicated that the
alkyl chain of the guest 1+ is
engulfed in the cavity of Cy6Q[6], whereas the ferrocene residue is
located outside the portal of the Cy6Q[6], resulting in the formation
of a [2]pseudorotaxane 1+@Cy6Q[6].

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra (400 MHz, D2O, 20 °C)
of guest 1+ alone (A), addition
of 1.1 equiv of Cy6Q[6] (B), addition of 1.1 equiv of Q[7] to the
solution of the 1:1.1 inclusion complex of 1+ with Cy6Q[6] (C), and a schematic representation of
the host–guest interactions of the Q[7] and Cy6Q[6] hosts with
the guest 1+.

This result is completely within our expectations
because the hydrophobic
cavity of the Cy6Q[6] is not large enough to encapsulate the ferrocene
residue. After the addition of 1.1 equiv of Q[7] to the above mixed
solution, all ferrocene protons shifted upfield and simultaneously
the alkyl chain protons shifted downfield. This observation indicated
that the ferrocene residue is included inside the cavity of Q[7],
whereas the alkyl chain is located outside the portal of the Q[7],
generating a new [2]pseudorotaxane 1+@Q[7]. It is obvious that the Cy6Q[6] is squeezed down the
hexyl chain of the guest by the strong electrostatic repulsion between
the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen of both hosts. In other words,
the binding affinity of Q[7] with the guest 1+ is larger than that of Cy6Q[6] with the guest 1+.

When the guest 1+ was quantitatively
oxidized to 12+, its ferrocene
form was changed to ferrocenium form. Although the guest 12+ is poor in water solubility, it displays
large enhancement in water solubility in the presence of Cy6Q[6] or
Q[7]. As shown in Figure 3B, the chemical shifts of 12+ upon binding with the host Cy6Q[6] are similar to that of 1+, suggesting that the guest 12+ can also bind with Cy6Q[6] to
form stable [2]pseudorotaxane. However, the binding behavior of the
oxidized 12+ with the host Q[7]
is completely different from that of the guest 1+. In the presence of 1.1 equiv of Q[7] (Figure 3C), the proton signals
of the alkyl chain on 12+ move
upfield and become broad, suggesting that the alkyl chain is included
inside the Q[7] cavity. This observation also indicates that the exchange
rate between the free and binding guest 12+ is rapid on the NMR time scale. When 1.1 equiv of Cy6Q[6]
was added to the mixed solution of 12+ and Q[7] (1:1.1), new sharp signals of the alkyl chain for 12+ appeared in the upfield (Figure 3D), indicating the
formation of a [2]pseudorotaxane 12+@Cy6Q[6]. As a result, two sets of chemical shifts of the alkyl
chain of 12+ are observed in Figure 3D, suggesting that
there is a competition between Q[7] and Cy6Q[6] toward the guest 12+. However, [2]pseudorotaxane 12+@Cy6Q[6] is kinetically stable
on the 1H NMR time scale and the integration of proton
signals (Figure S2 in SI) of the complexed 12+ suggests that the binding affinity
of the oxidized 12+ with Cy6Q[6]
is higher than with Q[7].

of the guest 12+ alone (A), addition
of 1.1 equiv of Cy6Q[6] (B), addition of 1.1 equiv of Q[7] (C), addition
of 1.1 equiv of Cy6Q[6] to the mixed solution of 12+ and Q[7] (D), and a schematic representation
of the host–guest interactions of the Q[7] and Cy6Q[6] hosts
with the guest 12+.

To better understand the host–guest interactions
of the
Q[7] and Cy6Q[6] hosts with the guest 1+ in aqueous solution, we next performed cyclic voltammogram
(CV) experiments. Figure 4a shows the CV behavior of 1+ in the absence (red line) and presence of Cy6Q[6] (black line).
As anticipated, 1+ undergoes
one reversible reduction in the absence of Cy6Q[6]. The addition of
1.1 equiv of Cy6Q[6] results in a pronounced cathodic shift, with
the half-wave potential (E1/2) of −58
mV. It is well known that the shift in half-wave potential (E1/2) reflects the relative binding affinities
of the guest of different redox states to the host.14 The cathodic shift indicates that the oxidized form 12+ is more stabilized by Cy6Q[6]
complexation than with the reduced form 1+. At the same time, a pronounced decrease in the current levels
is observed, which further confirmed the formation of the [2]pseudorotaxane
of Cy6Q[6] with 1+. The decrease
of current also suggests the smaller diffusion coefficient of the
[2]pseudorotaxane compared to that of free 1+.

of 1.0 equiv of

voltammograms (0.1 V s–1) of 0.1 mM 1+ in the presence of 1.0 equiv of Q[7] (black
line) and absence of Q[7] (red line). SCE, saturated calomel electrode.

When 1.1 equiv of Q[7] was added
to the aqueous solution of the
guest 1+, a pronounced decrease
in the current level was observed (Figure 4b). As it is stated above, the decrease of
current should be attributed to the host–guest association.
On the other hand, the addition of 1.1 equiv of Q[7] produces a pronounced
anodic shift in the position of the half-wave potential (E1/2 = 43 mV). The anodic shift indicates that the reduced 1+ interacts more strongly with Q[7]
compared with its oxidized form 12+. Combined with the 1H NMR spectra discussed above,
it is reasonable to believe that the host Q[7] would slide from the
ferrocenyl residue to the alkyl chain when the guest 1+ was oxidized to 12+. Likewise, the host Q[7] would slide back to the
ferrocenyl residue when the guest 12+ was reduced to 1+, as
shown in Scheme 1.
To monitor the reproducibility for this molecular switch, repeated
scanning of the mixed solution of Q[7] and 1+ was performed. No obvious changes in the voltammetric
behavior are observed, indicating that this molecular switch is stable
and reversible. The CV data clearly show that the reduced 1+ and oxidized 12+ characterize completely different binding affinities to the
same host, Cy6Q[6] or Q[7], which is in excellent agreement with the 1H NMR data. Addition of both Cy6Q[6] and Q[7] hosts into the
aqueous solution of the guest 1+ induces a small anodic shift compared with the addition of Q[7]
(Figure S3 in SI). This observation should
be attributed to mutual interference of both hosts.

Scheme 1 Proposed Molecular
Switch
In light of the above 1H NMR and CV experiment results,
we can construct a special molecular selector, as shown in Scheme 2. In this molecular
selector, the combination and dissociation of the hosts with the guest
can be controlled via redox conversions. In its reduced form, the
guest selectively binds to Q[7] and its ferrocene residue is encapsulated
into the Q[7] cavity, forming [2]pseudorotaxane 1+@Q[7]. In its oxidized form, Q[7] is squeezed
off the ferrocene residue and Cy6Q[6] moves on the alkyl chain, generating
[2]pseudorotaxane 12+@Cy6Q[6].
In other words, the oxidized 12+ would selectively bind to Cy6Q[6] rather than Q[7]. The results
of molecular energy minimization of both [2]pseudorotaxanes are shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Optimized structures
of [2]pseudorotaxanes 1+@Q[7]
(a) and 12+@Cy6Q[6] (b).

Scheme 2 Proposed Molecular Selector
To gain a better understanding
of why a guest selectively binds
with different hosts in its different redox states, we finally carried
out isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (Figure S4 in SI). It must be noted that we failed
to get the ITC data of 12+ with
both guests because of its poor solubility in aqueous solution. From
the data in Table 1, both host–guest bindings of Cy6Q[6] and Q[7] with 1+ exhibit high binding affinities,
in which the binding affinity of 1+ to Q[7] is higher than that to Cy6Q[6] by about 1 order of
magnitude. The large negative enthalpy values indicate that the binding
of 1+ with both hosts is an enthalpy-driven
process. According to the work of Rekharsky and Biedermann et al.,15 the large enthalpic gains mainly arise from
the release of high-energy water from within the host cavity. In fact,
the binding interaction of Q[7] with 1+ is enthalpically strongly favored (ΔH° = −74.95 kJ mol–1) but entropically
strongly disfavored (TΔS°
= −48.12 kJ mol–1).

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the binding
interactions of reduced 1+ and
oxidized 12+ with Q[7] and Cy6Q[6]
in aqueous solution by
various experimental techniques. The characterization of selective
complexation between the hosts and the guest in different oxidation
states developed a special molecular switch and molecular selector,
which can be controlled by redox conversions. The main driving forces
for the operation process of this molecular switch are the collaborative
contributions of hydrophobic contacts and ion–dipole interactions.
This investigation provides us a new idea in understanding and fabricating
molecular switches and machines.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
The hosts Q[7]16 and
Cy6Q[6]17 were prepared
according to the literature methods. Guest 1+ was prepared by reaction of the commercially available
dimethyl(ferrocenylmethyl)amine with 1-bromohexane. Dimethyl(ferrocenylmethyl)amine
(0.5 mL) was dissolved in acetone (5 mL) at room temperature, and
then 0.40 mL of 1-bromohexane was added in under stirring. The mixture
was refluxed for 6 h. The yellow precipitate was collected by filtration
with 10 mL of acetone washing and dried under vacuum to obtain 1+ with a yield of 90%. Guest 12+ was obtained from the guest 1+ according to a similar method in
the literature.18 All NMR data were recorded
on a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer in D2O at 293.15 K.

Electrochemical Experiments
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
data were recorded on a CHI 852 C electrochemical workstation (Co.,
CHI) interfaced to a personal computer. A three-electrode system consisting
of a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, a platinum
wire as the counter electrode, and a freshly polished glassy carbon
(diameter 2 mm) as the working electrode was used in a single compartment
cell. The experiments were conducted in pure water. The potentials
vary from 0 to −0.8 V, at a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1 and quiet time of 2 s. All solutions were purged
with purified nitrogen to remove dissolved oxygen before the electrochemical
measurements.19

Computations
The
geometries of Cy6Q[6] and Q[7] were
first optimized with the Hartree–Fock method using 3-21G* basis
sets. The geometries of Cy6Q[6] and Q[7] were further optimized using
density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. All calculations
were performed using a suite of the Gaussian 03 program.20

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Experiments
All titrations were carried out on a Nano ITC instrument (TA Instruments).
All solutions were prepared in purified water and degassed prior to
titration experiments. An aqueous solution (0.1 mm) of the host (Q[7]
or Cy6Q[6]) was placed in the sample cell (1.3 mL). A typical ITC
titration was carried out by titrating 25 aliquots of 1+ (1 mm, 8 μL) into a host solution.
The heat evolved was recorded at T = 298.15 K. The
heat of dilution was corrected by injecting the guest solution into
deionized water and subtracting these data from those of the host–guest
titration. Computer simulations (curve fitting) were performed using
the Nano ITC analyze software. The first data point was always removed
from the data set prior to curve-fitting. The data were analyzed with
ORIGIN 8.0 software using the independent model.21
