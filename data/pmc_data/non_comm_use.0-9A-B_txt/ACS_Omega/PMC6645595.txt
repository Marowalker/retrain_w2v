Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized
by porous carbon materials
(PCMs) are very promising for catalysis. In this work, monodispersed
small and stable copper oxide (CuO) NPs were prepared with an average
size of 10–20 nm without using any capping agent and then these
NPs were encapsulated into porous carbon. The chemical and structural
properties of the CuO/PCM material were characterized by powder X-ray
diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption.
The obtained CuO/PCM nanocatalytic system has been used for the synthesis
of N-arylamides from the reaction of aldoximes and aryl halides. Generally,
copper(II) salt was used for the preparation of amides from aldoximes
using some ligands and bases, but harsh reaction condition, stoichiometric
amount of metal, and lack of recyclability limit their applications
in industry. An alternative method is the use of heterogeneous catalysts.
More importantly, these heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recycled
and reused, showing potential application in organic synthesis.

1 Introduction
Synthesis
of N-arylamides has attracted wide attention because
of their pharmaceutical, biological, and material importance.1−9 Practically, N-arylamides are the basic precursor for the synthesis
of highly biologically active compounds and drugs.10−13 Therefore, the synthesis of amide
skeleton has become one of the most challenging tasks to the organic
chemists. The conventional methods, for the synthesis of amides, involve
coupling of activated carboxylic acid derivatives, viz., acid chloride,
anhydride, active esters, and so forth with a variety of amines. However,
these methods generate futile wastes, and as an upshot, unconsciously
serious environmental problems arise.14 Several alternative graceful methods along with the use of carbonyl
compounds (ketones and aldehydes) or carbonyl derivatives (oximes)
have been developed for the synthesis of amides.15 The acid-catalyzed rearrangement of ketoximes, known as
Beckmann rearrangement,16−21 constitutes a straightforward synthetic way to generate N-substituted
amides (RCONHR′). Following the same reaction conditions, aldoximes
(RCH=NOH) give the corresponding nitriles (RCN),22 while transition-metal catalysts can be able
to convert them into corresponding primary amides.23−29 Usually, the conversion of aldoximes into primary amides is successfully
catalyzed by a number of expensive transition metals such as Pd,30 Au/Ag,31 Ir,32 Ru,33 and Rh.34,35 However, less expensive, environment-friendly nature of copper has
captured the significant attention. In addition, homogeneous copper
catalysts have been used successfully for a variety of organic reactions.36−45 Furthermore, the catalyst systems need to be developed further because
of the possibility of metal contamination in the final product, lack
of recyclability of the metal catalyst, use of additives, and expensive
ligand system. Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) can be applied
in catalysis, gas sensing, and photocatalysis.46−48 The catalytic
properties of NPs are related with their size and surface area. Therefore,
the development of methodologies for the preparation of small CuO
NPs has importance for catalytic applications. Strongly interacting
capping agents were required for the synthesis of small CuO NPs.49−51 High-temperature calcination is required to eliminate these capping
agents, so the synthesis of small surface clean CuO NPs still remains
a challenge.

However, a large number of copper-catalyzed conversion
of aldoximes
to primary amides are available in the literature,27,52−57 but one-pot synthesis of secondary amides from aldoximes is less
explored. Rather, a number of procedures58−60 are reported
counting the transformation of ketoximes to N-arylamides. Now, in
the case of oximes of unsymmetrical ketones, mixtures of regioisomeric
products were formed, which further limited the scope of these reactions.
As a result, the development of resourceful, economic, and environment-friendly
catalytic system constitutes a motivating area for the one-pot synthesis
of secondary amides from aldoximes. Very recently, Panda and co-workers61 reported homogeneous copper sulfate-catalyzed
synthesis of N-arylamides from aldoximes. To the best of our knowledge,
here we report for the first time that the heterogeneous CuO/PCM nanocomposite
catalyzed the one-pot synthesis of N-arylamides from aldoximes and
aryl halides (Scheme 1). In the present work, we have prepared monodispersed small CuO
NPs. To show their relevance in catalysis, we have used these CuO
NPs for the synthesis of N-arylamides from aldoximes. After identifying
the significant role of CuO in the above reaction, supported CuO NPs
on porous carbon were prepared as the heterogeneous catalyst. The
CuO/PCM catalyst shows the catalytic activity similar to that of well-defined
CuO NPs.

Scheme 1 Context of the Copper-Catalyzed Amidation of Aryl Halides
2 Results
and Discussion
The CuO/PCM nanocatalytic system was readily
prepared by mixing
a porous carbon material (PCM) with the recently prepared suspension
of CuO NPs (Scheme 2). The latter CuO NPs were obtained within 1 h from copper acetate,
sodium hydroxide, ethanol, and a catalytic amount of acetic acid under
refluxing conditions. Our heterogeneous catalyst was prepared by mixing
the suspension of CuO dropwise to the solution of glucose, and then
the mixture was heated at 120–150 °C for 1 h. Finally,
the black product was obtained and heated in an alumina boat inside
a tube furnace at 850 °C under N2 atmosphere. After
slow cooling to room temperature, the resulting dried product was
obtained (yield = 50–60%). Copper loading was determined by
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and it was about 8.0 wt %.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the CuO/PCM Nanocatalyst
2.1 Characterization of CuO/PCM
Recently,
considerable interests have been focused on metal oxide NPs supported
on the PCM as heterogeneous catalysts by virtue of their versatility
in chemical compositions and structural architectures. Figure 1 shows the typical X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the CuO/PCM nanocatalyst. The diffraction peaks
located at about 2θ = 23.6 and 43.2° may be attributed
to the presence of amorphous (002) and graphitic (100) carbons.62 On the other hand, the characteristic peaks
at 2θ = 32.44, 35.46, 38.59, 48.69, 53.36, 61.47, 66.18, and
68° observed in both Figure 1a,b are ascribed due to the (110), (002), (111), (202),
(020), (113), (311), and (113) facets of the monoclinic crystalline
CuO in the CuO/PCM sample.

Figure 1 Powder XRD patterns of (a) fresh CuO/PCM catalyst
and (b) spent
CuO/PCM catalyst (after 10 cycles).

The distribution of CuO NPs on the carbon support as well
as particles
sizes was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Figure 2a,b shows the representative
images, and the particle size distribution histogram for CuO/PCM was
given in the inset. The images reveal homogeneous distribution of
the NPs on the carbon support. The histogram shows that CuO NP sizes
are in the 10–20 nm range. The average particle size was estimated
from the particle distribution histogram, and the obtained value is
14 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2c) of the CuO/PCM
catalyst indicates the crystalline structure of the CuO NPs.

of CuO/PCM (given in the inset) and SAED pattern of the CuO/PCM nanocatalyst
(c).

The morphology of the catalyst
was studied by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, Figure 3) instrument. Figure 3a shows the typical SEM image of the CuO suspension which showed
uniform spherical CuO NPs in the range of ∼20 nm. The SEM image
of the CuO/PCM nanocomposite has been shown in Figure 3b, in which CuO NPs are well-dispersed in
the range of 10–20 nm. The energy-dispersive analysis of X-ray
(EDAX) pattern also showed the presence of C and Cu in the sample
(Figure 3c). Elemental
mapping, obtained from SEM, indicates the presence of C and Cu and
the uniform dispersion of CuO NPs on the surface of the carbon support
(Figure 3d,e).

of suspended CuO NPs (a) and the CuO/PCM nanocomposite
(b), EDAX image of the CuO/PCM nanocomposite (c), and elemental mapping
of the CuO/PCM nanocomposite (d,e).

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize the
carbon
material. Figure 4 represents
the Raman spectra of fresh and recycled CuO/PCM nanocomposite. The
carbon support exhibited two prominent peaks at 1586 cm–1 (G band) arising from the sp2 carbon atoms, whereas the
peak at 1345 cm–1 indicates the D band. This D band
is normally associated with structural defects and amorphous phases.
Therefore, the intensity ratio of the D versus G band (i.e., ID/IG obtained from Figure 4a) is usually used
as a measure for the disorder of the carbon structure and was found
to be ∼0.87. The CuO/PCM material has ID/IG value less than 1 which means
this carbon material has less defective structure.

fresh CuO/PCM catalyst and (b) spent CuO/PCM
catalyst (after 10 cycles).

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the
CuO/PCM
catalyst are shown in Figure 5. The isotherm is a typical type IV isotherm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the catalyst was determined to be 84.9 m2 g–1. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution plot is given in the inset of Figure 5. This material has
various pores, and according to the BJH plot calculated from the N2 desorption isotherm, the sample has mesoscale pores ranging
from 2 to 5.5 nm.

catalyst.

2.2 Catalytic
Activity
We have investigated
the catalytic behaviors of CuO, CuO/AC (activated carbon), and CuO/PCM
for the synthesis of N-arylamides from aldoximes and aryl halides
under a reported reaction condition.61 To
realize our scheme, benzaldoxime (1a) and iodobenzene
(2a) were chosen as model substrates to assess the propensity
of arylation of aryl halides. All these catalysts exhibited comparable
activity (Table 1).
There is a possibility of homogeneous copper salt contamination in
the final product, lack of isolation, and reusability of the metal
salt, which restricts its application in the above reaction. However,
we found that the CuO and CuO/AC catalysts partially deactivated after
repeated use (Figure 6a). During five recycling tests, the yield of the desired product
decreased. The decrease, in the case of CuO, may be due to the agglomeration
of the CuO NPs. A significant decrease was observed when we used CuO/AC,
and CuO was obtained in the reaction mixture. This suggests the dissolution
of CuO/AC in the reaction solution probably because of the low interaction
between AC and CuO NPs. We also examined the stability of the CuO/PCM
catalyst. Compared to CuO and CuO/AC, CuO/PCM was much more stable
during recycling (Figure 6b). No significant decrease in the yield of the amides was
observed over repeated use. After five recycles, the yield of amides
was sustained at 72%. Therefore, CuO/PCM is a robust catalyst for
the synthesis of amides from aldoximes.

and CuO/AC and (b) CuO/PCM catalysts for the
synthesis of N-arylamides from benzaldoxime and iodobenzene. Reaction
conditions: iodobenzene (100 mg), benzaldoxime (4 equiv), copper catalyst
(10 mol %), and K2CO3 (5 equiv) in o-xylene (1 mL) were heated at 130 °C for 12 h.

K2CO3 (5 equiv) in o-xylene

Initially, we performed a series of experiments, with
a variation
of different reaction parameters such as solvent, base, temperature,
catalyst loading, and so forth. The results are summarized in Table 2. Among dimethylformamide
(DMF), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), toluene, CH3CN, p-xylene, and water, used for this experiment,
toluene was found to be the best solvent (Table 2, entry 2). Now, we optimize the bases used
for this reaction. Among the various bases, K2CO3 gave a higher product yield (Table 2, entry 2). Although NaHCO3 shows almost
parallel activity to K2CO3 (Table 2, entry 8), we have chosen K2CO3 as an optimized base for this reaction. As
the reaction did not proceed at room temperature (Table 2, entry 9), all the reactions
were performed under refluxing conditions. Also, we have studied the
activity of the support PCM in this coupling reaction, and no product
was found (Table 2,
entry 14). The experimental results revealed that the best optimized
reaction condition in terms of yield was obtained using benzaldoxime
(3 mmol), iodobenzene (1 mmol), and K2CO3 (4
mmol) in the presence of the CuO/PCM catalyst (6 mg, 0.25 mol %) in
toluene under refluxed conditions for 16 h (Table 2, entry 2).

To probe the generality of the reaction
conditions, different kinds
of aldoximes were coupled with aryl/heteroaryl halides to furnish
a library of N-aryl/-heteroaryl amides. The results are summarized
in Table 3. Both electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing groups attached to the phenyl ring of aryl
iodide were well-tolerated in this procedure giving uniform product
yields. p-Nitroiodobenzene reacts with benzaldoxime
to furnish 72% product yield (3d, Table 3). The reaction of 2-iodopyridine with benzaldoxime
is a good example, as it provided N-(pyridine-2-yl)benzamide
(3e, Table 3) as the main product. This protocol is also successful for the utilization
of bromobenzene as the aryl halide partner giving good yield under
optimized reaction conditions (3b, 3e, 3j, 3k, Table 3). The coupling of 4-chlorobenzaldoxime is highly chemoselective,
as the nucleophilic attack occurs only at the N atom, leaving the
−Cl group of the aromatic ring unaffected (3f, 3g, Table 3). The nitro-substituted aldoxime also reacts under similar reaction
conditions. These results clearly indicate that both electron-donating
(−MeO, −Me, −OH) and electron-withdrawing (−Cl,
−NO2) groups attached to the aldoxime part are well-tolerated
under the same reaction conditions. 4-Hydroxybenzaldoxime undergoes
this reaction to give the corresponding anilide product in excellent
yield (3h, Table 3). The coupling reaction of 4-bromoacetophenone and benzaldoxime
exclusively provided N-(4-acetylphenyl)benzamide
as the final product (3k, Table 3).

In the
case of aliphatic aldoximes, this protocol reveals equal
effectiveness giving the linear N-arylated amides. Acetaldoximes underwent
coupling with aryl halides smoothly to produce the corresponding product
in superior yield (Table 4).

Next, the scope of our methodology was inspected through the cross-coupling
of several heterocyclic aldoximes with aryl halides. The results are
summarized in Table 5. Aldoximes containing thiophene and furan moiety react with 2-bromopyridine
to form N-heteroarylated amides in good yields (7b and 7e, Table 5).

To realize the mechanism of this CuO/PCM-catalyzed synthesis of
N-arylamides from aldoximes, a detailed investigation was carried
out. To check whether the reaction proceeds through the radical mechanism,
the coupling reaction of benzaldoxime and iodobenzene was performed
in the presence of 1 equiv TEMPO, and it was found that the yield
of the reaction remained the same. Therefore, the radical mechanism
for the reaction is unlikely. Probable reaction mechanism for the
one-pot synthesis of amides catalyzed by CuO/PCM under heterogeneous
conditions may follow the established mechanism (Scheme 3).7,11,16,18,63

Scheme 3 Plausible Reaction Mechanism
To establish the proposed mechanism, we have studied some
more
reactions using the CuO/PCM catalyst in the coupling of benzaldoxime
and iodobenzene (Scheme 4). First, we have performed the coupling reaction under optimized
conditions but using dry solvent and molecular sieve (Scheme 4, reaction a). After the reaction,
we found the superior yield of the desired secondary amide. Generally,
dehydration and rehydration steps are the proposed mechanism for the
conversion of oxime to amide. Here, we have performed the reaction
under anhydrous condition, so water may not be acting as a nucleophile
for the rehydration step, but still secondary amides were obtained.
This indicates that another molecule of oxime acts as a nucleophile
and initiates the rehydration step.64,65 In this pathway,
one molecule of nitrile will be produced, which may interact with
the metal oxide and form a metal-bound nitrile intermediate to continue
the catalytic reaction. When the reaction was carried out between
benzamide (1 mmol) (instead of benzaldoxime) and iodobenzene (1 mmol)
under air using K2CO3 as the base and toluene
as the solvent (Scheme 4, reaction b), the secondary amide (N-phenylbenzamide,
95%) was obtained which means primary amide is an intermediate during
this coupling reaction. This can be established by another reaction,
when we have studied the reaction of benzaldoxime (3 mmol) without
using aryl halide under similar reaction conditions (Scheme 4, reaction c). In this case,
we have found only benzamide (85%) instead of the secondary amide.
Therefore, in conclusion, we can propose that in our case the oxime
molecule acts as a nucleophile for the rehydration step and the conversion
of aldoxime to secondary amide occurs through the primary amide intermediate.

under Reflux Conditions
2.3 Heterogeneity Test
An essential aim
of the heterogeneous catalyst is its life span for industrial applications.
Heterogeneous nature and the metal leaching of this catalyst were
examined using “hot filtration test”66 for the synthesis of N-arylamides from benzaldoxime and
iodobenzene.

2.3.1 Hot Filtration Test
After 6 h of
the reaction, the CuO/PCM material was separated by filtration and
35% yield was observed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The filtrate
was again refluxed for another 10 h. After 16 h, from the GC analysis
we can conclude that there was no considerable conversion taking place
in the filtrate after separation of the catalyst (Figure 7). This result confirms that
the reaction relatively did not progress upon the separation of the
catalyst. Further, CuO could not be detected by the AAS measurement of the filtrate or in
case if it was detected, it was found below the detection limit (0.003
mg/L). However, the negative result of the hot filtration test should
not be considered the actual heterogeneity of the active catalysis
species. This is because the insoluble solid support carbon can act
as a reservoir as well as a scavenger for the leached CuO. In many
conditions, the leached metal can be redeposited on the insoluble
solid support during the hot filtration test. Therefore, in this situation,
the catalytic pathway would be explained by a “release–capture”
mechanism.67,68

in the synthesis of
N-arylamides from benzaldoxime and iodobenzene.

2.4 Reusability Test
The recyclability
of the catalyst is important for the catalysis reaction. The reusability
test also confirms the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst. To examine
the reusability of the CuO/PCM material, the catalyst was separated
by filtration and washed. The subsequently catalytic runs were repeated
with the addition of reactants under optimum reaction conditions,
and the nature of the final product as well as yield was recorded. Figure 8 illustrates the
recycling ability of the catalyst for the N-arylamide synthesis from
benzaldoxime and iodobenzene during 10 cycles. However, the activity
of the catalyst decreased slightly from the third run. The TEM image
(Supporting Information, Figure S1) of
the recycled catalyst after the fifth run showed a small increase
in the size of CuO NPs due to agglomeration. This slight loss in the
catalytic activity may be due to the increase in size of the CuO NPs.
XRD, Raman spectra, and SEM (Supporting Information, Figure S1) of the recycled catalyst were quite similar to that
of the fresh catalyst. This indicates the stability and heterogeneous
nature of the CuO/PCM catalyst.

system in N-arylamide
synthesis.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have described a mild and efficient procedure
for the synthesis and characterization of the CuO/PCM catalyst. Most
importantly, this CuO NP catalyst proved its enormous activity for
the synthesis of N-arylamides from several aromatic, aliphatic, and
heterocyclic aldoximes. Diversely substituted aldoximes were coupled
smoothly to produce moderate-to-good yields. To the best of our knowledge,
we are not aware of any report demonstrating the synthesis of N-arylamides
from aldoximes using our as-synthesized CuO NP catalyst. In a broader
context, this protocol will provide a platform for the design of sustainable
C–N cross-coupling reactions for organic synthesis. Efforts
to develop the efficacy of our new catalyst systems to other cross-coupling
reactions are in progress and will be reported in due course.

4.1 Materials
Copper
acetate monohydrate
(Merck, 99%), acetic acid (Merck, >99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
pellets
(Alfa Aesar, 98%), and d(+)-glucose (Merck, >99%) were
used
without further purification. Different aldehydes, aryl halides, and
solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck and used without
further purification. Aldoximes were prepared using the literature
method reported elsewhere.

4.2 Synthesis of Colloidal
CuO NPs
Colloidal
CuO NPs were prepared following a reported method.69 In this method, 0.3 g of copper acetate and 0.2 mL of acetic
acid were dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol. The solution was refluxed,
followed by the addition of 0.3 g NaOH. The reaction mixture was continuously
refluxed for 1 h. The colloidal solution of CuO was centrifuged at
5500 rpm for 1 h, followed by filtration to yield CuO NP suspension.

4.3 Synthesis of the CuO/PCM Nanocatalyst
The
synthesis procedure of the CuO/PCM catalyst is given in Scheme 2. The colloidal CuO
NP solution was added dropwise into the glucose solution (2 g in 100
mL H2O) under vigorous stirring at 120 °C for 1 h.
Then the reaction mixture was stirred for another 1 h at temperature
150 °C, followed by cooling to room temperature. The deep black
colored product was obtained and ground in mortar. One gram of this
black product was then heat-treated inside a tube furnace at 850 °C
for 6 h at a rate of 6 °C/min under N2 atmosphere,
followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The yield of the CuO/PCM
catalyst was 50–60%.

4.4 Characterizations
Powder XRD patterns
were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu
Kα source using a radiation wavelength of 1.5418 Å. Diffraction
patterns in the 10°–80° region were recorded at a
rate of 0.4° (2θ) per min. The field emission SEM (FESEM)
images were recorded by Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP FESEM. TEM images were
recorded on a UHR-FEG TEM system (JEOL, model JEM 2100 F) using a
200 kV electron source. An Acton SpectraPro SP-2500 Raman spectrometer
was employed to analyze the nanostructures. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics Gemini VII surface area
analyzer and reported by the BJH analysis. Each sample was degassed
at 300 °C for 3 h. The specific surface area was determined according
to the BET method. The products were purified by column chromatography
using silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-400 NMR spectrophotometer
(400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C NMR)
using CDCl3 as the solvent. The 1H chemical
shifts are reported in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane.

4.5 Synthetic Procedure of N-Arylamides from Aldoximes
and Aryl Halides
To a mixture of aldoxime (3 mmol) and aryl
halide (1 mmol) in toluene (3.0 mL), the CuO/PCM catalyst (0.25 mol
%) and K2CO3 (4 mmol) were added, and the mixture
was refluxed for 16 h under air. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled
to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic
layer was separated, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Finally,
the crude product was purified by column chromatography over silica
gel with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (85:15) as the eluent to furnish
pure N-arylamides.

4.6 General Procedure for the
“Hot Filtration”
Test
To a mixture of benzaldoxime (3 mmol) and aryl iodide
(1 mmol) in toluene (3.0 mL), the CuO/PCM catalyst (0.25 mol %) and
K2CO3 (4 mmol) were added, and the mixture was
refluxed under air. After 6 h of the reaction time, the catalyst was
separated from the reaction mixture under hot condition. The yield
of the product was determined by GC. Then, the filtrate was again
refluxed for another 10 h, and finally, after 16 h the yield of the
desired product was determined by using GC.

In a mixture of
benzaldoxime (3 mmol) and aryl iodide (1 mmol) in toluene (3.0 mL),
the CuO/PCM catalyst (0.25 mol %), and K2CO3 (4 mmol) were added, and the mixture was refluxed under air. To
measure the amount of the leached CuO, the catalyst was separated
from the reaction mixture under hot condition after 6 h of the reaction
time. Then the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The
HNO3 solution [5 mL 5% (in aq)] was added to the crude
material and stirred. After that, this solution was taken in a 10
mL volumetric flask, and the volume was made up to the mark. Finally,
this solution was studied using the AAS measurement to calculate the
amount of leached CuO.

4.7 General Procedure for the
Recycling Test
After 16 h of the reaction, the reaction mixture
was cooled to
room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate. The catalyst was
separated, and the organic layer was used for the determination of
the yield of the product. The catalyst was washed three times with
toluene, ethyl acetate, and water and dried. Finally, the catalyst
was reused for the next run under optimized reaction conditions.
