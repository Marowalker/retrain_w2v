The polyethyleneimine-modified
polymers, polystyrene–divinylbenzene-based
(TAs) and polymethacrylate-based polymers (TAm), were used as palladium
scavengers to eliminate residual palladium species after palladium
on carbon-catalyzed Sonogashira-type coupling reaction. Since both
TAs and TAm indicated relatively favorable elimination abilities toward
residual palladium species in the reaction mixture, the affinities
of TAs and TAm for palladium species were used as supports for palladium
catalysts. The TAm-supported palladium catalyst (Pd/TAm) indicated
better catalyst properties for the chemoselective hydrogenation compared
to those of the corresponding TAs-supported palladium catalyst (Pd/TAs).
Aromatic benzyl ethers; aromatic and aliphatic N-Cbzs;
and aromatic carbonyl groups were smoothly hydrogenated in the presence
of 1–5 mol % of Pd/TAm in MeOH or 2-PrOH. In contrast, the
hydrogenation of aromatic ketones was selectively suppressed in morpholine
which act as appropriate catalyst poison and solvent. Furthermore,
Pd/TAm-catalyzed chemoselective hydrogenation was applicable to continuous-flow
reaction.

1 Introduction
Chemoselective
hydrogenation as an alternative reductive transformation
of reducible functionalities in the presence of multiple reducible
functionalities is a useful synthetic methodology for the novel short-step
synthetic route.1,2 Heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation
methods have been widely used as environmentally friendly reactions
due to their easy removability from reaction mixtures by the simple
filtration, reusability, and reduction of contaminants requiring separation
after the reaction.2d,2e,3,4

Two main strategies to establish heterogenous
palladium (Pd)-catalyzed
chemoselective hydrogenation are available. The first is the utilization
of appropriate catalyst poisons that partially block the catalytic
active site by the moderate coordinating property toward the Pd species5−7 such as Lindlar’s catalyst.5 We
have developed various Pd/C-catalyzed chemoselective hydrogenation
methods using catalyst poisons, such as diphenyl sulfide (Ph2S),6a,6b amines,6c and
ammonium acetate (NH4OAc).6d The use of the complexes of Pd/C and coordinable catalyst poisons,
such as Pd/C-diphenyl sulfide [Pd/C(Ph2S)],7a and Pd/C-ethylenediamine (en) complexes [Pd/C(en)]7b−7e was effective for chemoselective hydrogenation as heterogeneous
catalysts.7 In contrast, it is well known
that the development of chemoselective heterogeneous catalysts is
largely dependent on the unique characteristics of catalyst supports.8−10 We have also previously reported many heterogeneous and chemoselective
Pd catalysts immobilized on polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Pd/PEI),9j,9k fibroin silk protein (Pd/Fib),9h,9l−9n molecular sieves 3A (Pd/MS3A),9c,9f,9i boron nitride (Pd/BN),9c,9e,9g ceramics (Pd/ceramic),9b and monolithic ion-exchange resins (Pd/monolith)9a each exhibiting different catalytic activities. Chelate
resins bearing metal-coordinating chelate functionalities on a polymer
backbone, such as iminodiacetate10b and
tertiary amine moieties,10a,10c are well-known effective
supports of Pd for the production of chemoselective hydrogenation
catalysts. Chelate resins have been used as scavengers to eliminate
residual metals in reaction mixtures to prevent the contamination
of the products such as medicines and fine chemicals.11 The maximum permissible amount of residual Pd in medicines
is strictly defined in the guideline ICH Q3D due to its toxicity and
function depression properties on functional materials.12 The information of ICH harmonization for better
health is available online: http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines.html. Therefore, the elimination of residual Pd from products and/or
reaction solutions in each reaction step is quite important.

Herein, we have evaluated the Pd scavenging abilities of polystyrene–divinylbenzene-based
(TAs) and polymethacrylate-based polymers (TAm) modified with polyethyleneimine
(PEI, range of MW ca. 200–10 000) as a chelate for the
elimination of leached Pd species during the Pd/C-catalyzed Sonogashira-type
reaction.13 Because the TAs and TAm indicated
appropriate elimination efficiencies of leached Pd species based on
the chelating ability of the PEI moiety, we have also applied TAm
as a sufficiently capable support for Pd (Pd/TAm) for chemoselective
hydrogenation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Elimination of Leached Pd Species Using TAm
and TAs
We have recently developed effective scavenging methods
for the elimination of leached Pd species during the Pd/C-catalyzed
Sonogashira-type reaction13 using thiol-modified
dual-pore silica beads as a Pd scavenger.14 Because non-negligible amounts of both two and zero valent Pd species
were leached from the heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst during the Pd/C-catalyzed
Sonogashira-type reaction using 4′-iodoacetophenone and 3-butyn-1-ol
due to the strong coordination of the alkyne moiety of 3-butyn-1-ol,13 the reaction was suitable for evaluating the
Pd scavenging abilities of chelate resins. The Pd scavenging abilities
of the PEI-modified resins (TAs and TAm) from the diluted filtrate
(23.8 μM of the leached Pd species) during the Sonogashira-type
reaction were compared with those of commercially available Pd scavengers
based on silica beads modified with propylamine or diethylenetriamine
functionalities. The filtrate of 0.4 mol % of 10% Pd/C (85.2 mg, 80.0
μmol)-catalyzed Sonogashira-type coupling reaction of 4′-iodoacetophenone
(4.92 g, 20.0 mmol), 1.5 equiv of 3-butyn-1-ol (2.27 mL, 30.0 mmol),
and Na3PO4·12H2O (15.2 g, 40.0
mmol) in 2-PrOH/H2O (40/40 mL) at 80 °C for 2 h was
extracted with EtOAc (100 mL) and H2O (100 mL), and the
organic layer was diluted to 200 mL with EtOAc. The Pd concentration
in the diluted EtOAc solution was 23.8 μM and was divided into
four equal portions (50 mL each), and 1.00 g of Pd scavengers (TAm
and TAs) was added to each portion. The scavenger in each EtOAc solution
was removed by simple filtration after stirring at 25 °C for
3 h, and the Pd concentrations in the filtrates were measured via
atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) (the Pd detection limit
of the AAS analysis: 1 ppm) (Table 1). Although the propylamine-modified silica beads were
only modestly beneficial for Pd scavenging in the Pd/C-catalyzed Sonogashira-type
reaction (23%, entry 1), diethylenetriamine-modified silica beads
and TAm and TAs scavengers showed relatively efficient scavenging
abilities (41–47%, entries 2–4) due to the appropriate
bidentate coordinable activity of the alkyldiamine moieties toward
Pd(0) species. The highest Pd scavenging efficiency (47%) was achieved
using polyethyleneimine-modified polystyrene–divinylbenzene-based
scavenger (TAs, entry 4). The higher scavenging ability is likely
because of the higher alkyldiamine moiety content per unit weight
of TAs and the auxiliary π-interaction effect toward Pd species
of the aromatic rings constituting the polystyrene–divinylbenzene
backbone of the TAs. The use of Pd scavengers with high Pd capture
capacity per unit weight is essential from the practical and industrial
point of view. The diethylenetriamine-modified silica beads indicated
the highest Pd scavenging efficiency per amine functional group substituting
on the polymer backbone (%/mmol/g) as compared to the other scavengers
(entry 2 vs 1, 3, and 4).

2.2 Development
of the Pd/TAm Catalyst and Its
Application for Chemoselective Hydrogenation
We have previously
developed a heterogeneous Pd(0)–polyethyleneimine (Pd/PEI)
catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of alkyne functionalities
by exploiting the appropriate catalyst poison effect and strong chelating
ability of the polyethyleneimine moiety toward Pd(0).9j,9k Because the polyethyleneimine-modified TAm and TAs exhibit comparatively
efficient Pd-adsorption abilities as Pd scavengers and proportionally
lower ratios of polyethylenediamine moieties within the molecule compared
to the support (polyethyleneimine) of Pd/PEI,9j,9k they were used as the Pd catalyst supports to develop active hydrogenation
catalysts due to their moderate coordinable properties toward Pd.
Pd species were embedded on TAm and TAs in a manner analogous to our
previously established preparation method for the chelate resin-supported
heterogeneous Pd catalysts10 (Scheme 1). TAm and TAs were
immersed in an EtOAc solution of Pd(OAc)2 at 25 °C
and stirred for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. Colorless TAm (A,
mean particle diameter; 144 μm) and TAs (A′, mean particle
diameter; 710 μm) gradually turned to yellow (B and B′)
with decoloring of the dark-orangish EtOAc solution of Pd(OAc)2. The filtered yellowish [Pd(OAc)2-adsorbed] TAm
(B) and TAs (B′) were washed using MeOH and H2O,
dried under reduced pressure, and subsequently stirred in the aqueous
solution of hydrazine monohydrate at 25 °C under argon for 3
h. The resulting pale gray resins were collected by filtration, washed
with MeOH and H2O, and dried under reduced pressure to
afford Pd/TAm (C) and Pd/TAs (C′). The Pd contents of the products
were both 3.3 wt % based on the concentration of the residual Pd(OAc)2 in the EtOAc filtrate determined by AAS (the Pd detection
limit of the AAS analysis: 1 ppm).

Scheme 1 Preparation of 3.3% Pd/TAm and 3.3%
Pd/TAs
We first evaluated the catalytic
activity for the hydrogenation
of diphenylacetylene (1) using the 3.3% Pd/TAm and 3.3%
Pd/TAs (Table 2). Although 1 was absolutely hydrogenated to afford corresponding diphenylethane
(2) in the presence of 3.3% Pd/TAm (1 mol %) under atmospheric
H2 conditions in MeOH at 25 °C for 2.5 h (entry 1),
the 3.3% Pd/TAs-catalyzed hydrogenation of 1 was incomplete
even after 24 h under the same conditions (entry 2). Furthermore,
5% Pd/PEI catalyst as a chemoselective semihydrogenation catalyst
of alkynes9j,9k exhibited the low catalyst activity
for the hydrogenation of 1 under nearly the same conditions
as compared to the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst (entry 3 vs 1). Therefore,
the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst was selected as the most promising heterogeneous
Pd catalyst for further screening.

b Diphenylacetylene
(0.25 mmol, 44.6
mg) and 1 mol % of 3.3% Pd/TAm or 3.3% Pd/TAs (2.5 μmol, 8.1
mg) in MeOH (1.0 mL) were stirred at 25 °C under hydrogen atmosphere.

c Diphenylacetylene (1.0 mmol,
178.2
mg) and 0.83 mol % of 5% Pd/PEI (8.3 μmol, 17.8 mg) in MeOH
(2.0 mL) were stirred at 25 °C under hydrogen atmosphere.

Next, the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst was
analyzed in detail using high-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM),
electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The mean particle size of the Pd clusters was estimated to
be approximately 2.7 nm with a standard deviation of 1.5 nm based
on the HAADF-STEM image (Figure 1a). EPMA indicated that the Pd clusters were uniformly
distributed in all regions of the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst (Figure 1b,c). Regions with relatively
high Pd concentration in 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst are shown in red in Figure 1c. Furthermore, it
was clear that the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst was composed of a combination
of approximately equal amounts of Pd(0) metal (characteristic peaks
at ca. 340.2 and 335.1 eV corresponding to Pd 3d3/2 and
Pd 3d5/2) and Pd(II) (characteristic peaks at ca. 342.9
and 337.2 eV corresponding to Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2) by XPS analysis, despite the hydrazine reduction during catalyst
preparation (Scheme 1). The strong coordination ability of the polyethyleneimine moiety
on TAm toward Pd(II) partially suppressed the reduction of Pd(II)
to Pd(0) due to the enhanced electron density of Pd(II).10c Furthermore, XPS analysis of the 3.3% Pd/TAm
after hydrogenation revealed that the content ratio of Pd(II) and
Pd(0) was almost entirely maintained before and after use (Figure 1d,e). These results
strongly supported that no reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) species by
PEI and/or hydrogen gas has occurred during hydrogenation. The characteristic
peaks of Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 and the area%
of Pd(II) ions and Pd(0) species are indicated in the Supporting Information
(Figure S1).

and (d, e) XPS spectra of the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst before and after
use, respectively.

The hydrogenation catalytic
activity of 3.3% Pd/TAm was evaluated
at 25 °C under atmospheric H2 conditions in MeOH (Table 3). Alkyne (entry 1),
azide (entry 2), nitro (entry 3), N-Cbz (entries
4 and 5), alkene (entries 6 and 12), as well as aromatic and aliphatic
benzyl ester functionalities (entries 6 and 7, respectively) were
smoothly hydrogenated. p-Anisaldehyde was selectively
hydrogenated to the corresponding benzyl alcohol without hydrogenolysis
of the benzylic hydroxyl group (entry 8). In contrast, 4-hydroxyphenyl
benzyl ether as an aromatic benzyl ether was debenzylated to afford
the corresponding hydroquinone (entry 9), and 2-(benzyloxy)ethanol
as an aliphatic benzyl ether was tolerated under the same hydrogenation
conditions (entry 10). The reductive ring opening reaction of trans-stilbene oxide was observed to quantitatively afford
1,2-diphenylethanol without hydrogenolysis of the benzylic hydroxyl
group (entry 11). tert-Butyldimethylsilyl ether was
tolerated under the same hydrogenation conditions, whereas a co-existing
olefin was selectively hydrogenated (entry 12).

b Recovery of the substrate.

Furthermore, the 10 mmol scale hydrogenation
of 1 (1.8
g; 10 mmol) was successful, and Pd leaching was not detected in the
reaction mixture by AAS (below the Pd detection limit of 1 ppm) (eq 1). 1  The catalytic activity of 3.3% Pd/TAm for
the hydrogenation of aromatic ketones was relatively low, and the
hydrogenation of isobutyrophenone (5a) was incomplete
in MeOH at 25 °C for 24 h (Table 4, entry 1; standard conditions). The hydrogenation
of 5a was achieved in 2-PrOH solvent at 50 °C to
afford the corresponding benzyl alcohol (6a) without
further hydrogenolysis of the benzylic hydroxyl group by increasing
the loading of 3.3% Pd/TAm to 5 mol % (entry 2). The total suppression
of hydrogenation of the aromatic ketone functionality of 5a was achieved using morpholine solvent in the presence of 1 mol %
of 3.3% Pd/TAm due to the moderate poisonous effect of morpholine
(entry 3). In contrast, the hydrogenation of 5a catalyzed
by 5% Pd/C or 7% Pd/WA3010a,10c with tertiary amine
functionalities on the polystyrene–divinylbenzene skeleton
of WA30 was incompletely suppressed in morpholine (entries 3 vs 4
and 5). Acetophenone (5b) was selectively hydrogenated
to the corresponding benzyl alcohol (6b) in the presence
of 5 mol % of the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst (entry 6), whereas the reduction
of 5b was completely suppressed in the morpholine solvent
(entry 7).

Furthermore, the 3.3% Pd/TAm-catalyzed hydrogenation
of the compound
(8) containing alkyne, benzyl ether and aromatic ketone
functionalities was investigated (Scheme 2). Although the all reducible functionalities
of 8 were completely hydrogenated to afford the corresponding
ethylbenzene derivative (9) in a quantitative yield using
a 10% Pd/C catalyst (top of Scheme 2), the 3.3% Pd/TAm-catalyzed hydrogenation of 8 in MeOH at 50 °C chemoselectively formed 10 in excellent yield (93%) without hydrogenolysis of the benzylic
hydroxy group or benzyl ether (middle of Scheme 2). Furthermore, only the alkyne functionality
was chemoselectively hydrogenated, and the corresponding aromatic
ketone and benzyl ether survived in morpholine solvent (11, the bottom of Scheme 2).

Various Reducible Functionalities
Reuse test of the 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst was tested under
the same
hydrogenation conditions using benzyl benzoate as a substrate (Table 5). The catalyst was
quantitatively recovered by simple filtration and reused at least
5 times. Although the turnover frequency (TOF) of 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst
in each reaction was gradually decreased with the prolongation of
the reaction time due to physical abrasion of the catalyst by stirring,
the hydrogenation of benzyl benzoate was completed to give the corresponding
benzoic acid in moderate turnover numbers (TON) of 3.3% Pd/TAm catalyst
(TON; 98–100).

A comparison of the catalytic activities
of 3.3% Pd/TAm, Pd/C,
and several heterogeneous Pd catalysts previously developed for chemoselective
hydrogenations in our laboratory1a−1e,6,7,9,10 is
shown in Figure 2.
Each catalyst surrounded by a square catalyzed the hydrogenation of
the reducible functionalities below each line, and various reducible
functionalities surrounded by a thick-frame were hydrogenated using
3.3% Pd/TAm. It should be noted that the 3.3% Pd/TAm-catalyzed hydrogenation
of aromatic ketones could be controlled using a 2-PrOH or morpholine
solvent.

Figure 2 Comparison of the hydrogenation catalytic activity of 3.3% Pd/TAm,
Pd/C, and several previously developed chemoselective heterogeneous
Pd catalysts.

Next, we have applied
3.3% Pd/TAm as a solid in the form of beads
(ca. 144 μm diameter) to continuous-flow hydrogenation reactions
utilizing the avoidable shape of the unfavorable back pressure. A
0.05 M MeOH solution of benzyl benzoate (13.5 mmol in 270 mL) was
flowed through a catalyst cartridge (φ 4.6 × 50 mm) filled
with 3.3% Pd/TAm (100 mg) once at 0.4 mL/min and 50 °C under
an atmosphere of hydrogen gas 10 mL/min: (eq 2). The continuous-flow system using 3.3% Pd/TAm
was successfully applied for the gram scale reaction without the deterioration
of catalytic activity due to the physical damage- and attrition-free
conditions resulting from the stirring (eq 2 vs Table 5). Higher TON and TOF could be achieved in a continuous-flow
hydrogenation reaction using a 3.3% Pd/TAm cartridge (TON; 409.4 and
TOF; 36.4 h–1, eq 2 vs Table 5). Furthermore, the 3.3% Pd/TAm-catalyzed flow hydrogenation
of 8 was investigated (eq 3).
Although product 10 was obtained under batch conditions
in MeOH at 50 °C (Scheme 2, middle), only the alkyne functionality was chemoselectively
hydrogenated to afford 11 in nearly quantitative yield
during the single pass through the cartridge filled with the 3.3%
Pd/TAm catalyst (TON; 15.8 and TOF; 38.0 h–1, eq 3). 2  

3 Conclusions
We have demonstrated that polyethylene-modified TAm and TAs show
beneficial Pd scavenging activities compared to those of commercially
available Pd scavengers (diethylenetriamine-modified silica beads)
for the elimination of leached Pd in the filtrate of the ligand- and
copper-free Pd/C-catalyzed Sonogashira-type reaction.13 Because the TAm and TAs indicated comparable removal (acquisition)
capabilities for Pd species due to the adequate coordinable property
of the polyethyleneimine moiety, TAm was used as a support of the
heterogeneous Pd catalyst (3.3% Pd/TAm) for the development of a novel
chemoselective hydrogenation catalyst. The optimized catalyst, 3.3%
Pd/TAm, was developed as a recoverable, reusable and Pd-leaching free
catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation. Furthermore, 3.3% Pd/TAm
was amenable to the continuous-flow hydrogenation reactions due to
its high durability and unique chemoselectivity.

Study of the Pd Species Leached
during the Pd/C-Catalyzed Sonogashira-Type Reaction Using Four Kinds
of Pd Scavengers (Table 1)
To a solution of 4′-iodoacetophenone (4.92 g, 20.0
mmol), dry-type 10% Pd/C (85.2 mg, 80.0 μmol) and Na3PO4·12H2O (15.2 g, 40.0 mmol) in 2-PrOH
(40 mL), and H2O (40 mL) was added 3-butyn-1-ol (2.27 mL,
30.0 mmol) at 25 °C under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture
was stirred at 80 °C (external oil bath temperature), and the
reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After
completion of the reaction (2 h), the reaction mixture was cooled
to 25 °C and filtered through celite to remove Pd/C and insoluble
salts. The filtrate was extracted with additional EtOAc (100 mL) and
water (100 mL), and the organic layer was diluted to 200 mL with EtOAc
(Pd concentration: 23.8 μM) and divided to four equal portions
(each 50 mL). Subsequently, each 1.00 g of propylamine-modified silica
beads, triamine-modified silica beads, TAm and TAs were added to each
divided EtOAc solution (50 mL) as Pd species scavengers, respectively,
and stirred for 3 h at 25 °C. Each reaction mixture was filtered
to remove the scavenger. Pd concentration in each filtrate was measured
by atomic absorption spectrometry. Elimination (23, 42, 41, and 47%)
of Pd species could be achieved.

4.2.2 Preparation
of Pd/TAm and Pd/TAs (Scheme 2)
A suspension
of dry TAm (1.00 g, colorless powder) in EtOAc solution (40 mL) of
Pd(OAc)2 [72.0 mg, 321 μmol (34.1 mg, palladium quantity)]
was stirred under an argon atmosphere at 25 °C for 1 day. The
resulting yellow solid was collected by filtration (1 mm filter paper),
washed with H2O (5 mL × 5) and MeOH (5 mL × 5),
and dried in vacuo for 12 h. The filtrate was transferred to a 100
mL volumetric flask and diluted to 100 mL with H2O, and
8.14 ppm (814 μg) of palladium species was observed in the diluted
filtrate by the use of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (SHIMADZU AA-7000).
The collected solid was then stirred with NH2NH2·H2O (24.0 μL, 481 μmol) in H2O (40 mL) under an argon atmosphere at 25 °C for 4 h. The pale
gray solid was collected by filtration (1 mm filter paper), washed
with H2O (5 mL × 5) and MeOH (5 mL × 5), and
dried in vacuo for 12 h to give Pd/TAm (999.0 mg). The filtrate was
transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and diluted to 100 mL with
H2O, and 0.35 ppm (35.0 μg) of palladium species
was observed in the diluted filtrate. Since the total palladium species
which was not absorbed on TAm were 849 μg, the palladium content
of Pd/TAm was estimated to be 3.3% [(34.1 – 0.849)/999 ×
100].

Pd/TAs were also prepared using TAs (166.6 mg, white solid),
and Pd(OAc)2 [11.2 mg, 50.0 μmol (5.3 mg, palladium
quantity)] in a method similar to prepare 3.3% Pd/TAm and 156.1 mg
of Pd/TAs was obtained. Since the total free palladium species in
the filtrates after the palladium absorption and subsequent reduction
process were 21.5 μg, the palladium content of Pd/TAs was estimated
to be 3.3% [(5.3 – 0.022)/156 × 100].

4.2.3 General Procedure for Chemoselective Hydrogenation
(Tables 2–4)
A mixture of a substrate (250 μmol)
and 3.3% Pd/TAm or Pd/TAs (8.1 mg, 2.5 μmol) in MeOH, 2-PrOH,
or morpholine (1 mL) was stirred at 25 or 50 °C using a test
tube equipped with H2 balloon. The reaction was continuously
monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After the specific time as
indicated in Tables 2–4, the mixture was filtered by membrane
filter (pore size: 0.45 μm). The catalyst on the filter was
washed with EtOAc (5 mL × 3). The combined filtrates were concentrated
in vacuo to afford the corresponding analytically pure product (1H and 13C spectra are described in the Supporting Information).

Activity Control of 3.3%
Pd/TAm for the Hydrogenation of Aromatic Ketone Derivativesab
a Reaction conditions: substrate (0.25
mmol) and Pd catalyst in MeOH, 2-PrOH, or morpholine (1 mL) stirred
at 25 °C for 24 h under a hydrogen atmosphere.

b The ratio was determined by 1H NMR and isolated yields indicated in parentheses.

4.2.4 Reuse
Test of 3.3% Pd/TAm for Hydrogenation
(Table 5)
The first run shown in Table 5: a mixture of benzyl benzoate (425 mg, 2.0
mmol) and 3.3% Pd/TAm (64.8 mg, 2.0 μmol) in MeOH (8 mL) was
stirred at 25 °C under atmospheric hydrogen atmosphere (balloon)
conditions. The mixture was filtered using a funnel (1 mm filter paper)
after 4.5 h reaction. The catalyst on the filter was washed with EtOAc
(3 mL × 5), and the combined filtrates were concentrated in vacuo
to afford 240 mg of benzoic acid (1.97 mmol, 98%). The recovered catalyst
was dried at 25 °C in vacuo overnight (63.7 mg, 98% recovery).
The second run reaction was carried out in analogy with the first
run except for the usage of benzyl benzoate (425 mg, 2.0 mmol) and
3.3% Pd/TAm (63.7 mg, 2.0 μmol) for 5.5 h, and benzoic acid
was obtained in quantitative yield (252 mg, 2.0 mmol). The 3–5
run reactions were also carried out in a manner similar to the first
run except for the usage of the substrate and catalyst in association
with a slight loss of the catalyst during the recovery by filtration,
and the reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography.
The detailed results are described in the Supporting Information.

b Isolated yields were indicated
in

4.2.5 Gram Scale Hydrogenation in Continuous-Flow
Conditions (eq 2)
A solution of benzyl benzoate (2.87 g, 13.5 mmol) in MeOH (270 mL,
0.05 M) was pumped at 0.4 mL/min into the catalyst-packed cartridge
[3.3% Pd/TAm (100.0 mg); φ 4.6 × 50 mm] together with a
flow rate of 10 mL/min hydrogen gas at 50 °C after the flow of
MeOH and hydrogen gas to the cartridge under the same conditions for
ca. 10 min. The whole reaction mixture was collected and concentrated
in vacuo to give the corresponding benzoic acid (1.55 g, 12.7 mmol)
in 94% yield as a colorless solid.

4.2.6 General
Procedure for Chemoselective Hydrogenation
in Continuous-Flow Conditions (eq 3)
A solution of the substrate (250 μmol) in MeOH (10 mL, 0.05
M) was pumped at 0.4 mL/min into the catalyst-packed cartridge [3.3%
Pd/TAm (100.0 mg); φ 4.6 × 50 mm] together with a flow
rate of 10 mL/min hydrogen gas at 50 °C after the flow of MeOH
and hydrogen gas to the cartridge under the same conditions for ca.
10 min. The whole reaction mixture was collected and concentrated
in vacuo to give the corresponding hydrogenated product. If necessary,
the product was further purified by silica gel-column chromatography
(hexane/EtOAc).
