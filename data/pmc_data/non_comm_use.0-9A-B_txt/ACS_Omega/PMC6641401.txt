Organic–inorganic
halide perovskites have emerged as one
of the most promising materials for photovoltaic applications. Because
of the polycrystalline nature of perovskite thin films, it is crucial
to investigate the impact of microstructures on device performance.
In this study, we employ ramp-annealing to tailor the texture of perovskite
thin films via controlling the nucleation of perovskite grains. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy studies further suggest that the thin film
texture impacts not only the charge collection at the contact but
also the carrier transport in the bulk perovskite layer. The combination
of the two effects leads to enhanced performance in devices constructed
of preferentially oriented perovskite thin films.

1 Introduction
Recently,
organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells
have drawn a tremendous amount of attention because of their low-cost,
facile fabrication, and high efficiency.1−6 Perovskite films can be effectively formed simply by spin-coating
precursor solution onto substrates, followed by a low-temperature
annealing treatment.3,7 A high light absorption coefficient
has been established in this class of material, where ∼90%
of light (wavelength: 350–750 nm) can be absorbed in a 400
nm thick film.7,8 Additionally, the low exciton
binding energy on the order of tens of millielectron volt indicates
that free charge carriers are predominantly generated under illumination.9−12 However, beyond the light harvesting capability, carrier transport
and charge collection also collectively contribute to the efficiency
of photovoltaic devices.13−17

Because of the polycrystalline nature of perovskite thin films,
it is thus critical to investigate the impacts of microstructures,
such as grain size, crystallinity, and texture structure, on the electrical
properties of thin films.18−23 More interestingly, recent studies have suggested that the texture
of the perovskite thin film may play a more significant role than
the size of perovskite grains in determining the device efficiency.20,24 Thus far, time-resolved photoluminescence (tr-PL) is the most commonly
adapted technique for investigating the influence of the crystal orientation
and/or the texture structure on charge carrier dynamics in perovskite
solar cells. Although variations in the carrier lifetime are observed
for perovskite thin films with different textures,15,25−28 it is challenging to disentangle the texture effects on charge transport
and collection processes because the trap states in the bulk and at
the surface would both influence the carrier lifetime determined from
the tr-PL measurements.29

In this
paper, we conduct electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements on perovskite devices with thin film crystallinity
and texture controlled by ramp-annealing. The device performance is
strongly correlated to the texture of perovskite thin films. EIS measurements
that are capable of differentiating the charge transport and collection
processes according to their responses to light intensity, applied
bias, and frequency further reveal that the more textured perovskite
thin film exhibits suppressed surface recombination at the contacts,
which, along with the longer carrier diffusion length, ultimately
leads to the enhanced short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Ramp-Annealing Treatment
and the Crystalline
Structure of Thin Films
Figure S1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film deposited on PEDOT:PSS/ITO
using the conventional one-step solution process,7 where the annealing is performed at 100 °C for 10
min which we term as the fast-annealing treatment. Beyond the relatively
high density of cracks, the θ–2θ X-ray diffraction
(XRD) scan of such prepared films in the Bragg–Brentano configuration
(blue curve in Figure 1b) further reveals the polycrystalline nature of the film with perovskite
grains oriented along the (110), (310), (112) planes, and so forth.
To improve the surface morphology and to gain a better control over
the film crystallinity and texture, we adapt the ramp-annealing treatment
in our fabrication process. The schematics of the annealing profile
are sketched in Figure S3a, which consists
of three steps, that is, low temperature annealing, ramping, and final
annealing at 100 °C. The rationale behind this treatment is twofold:
(i) to induce heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite phase at
the interface between the film (solvent–solute) and the substrate
and (ii) to remove solvent molecules when the film is still largely
amorphous, thus minimizing cracking. The microstructure of the perovskite
thin film is determined by the nucleation and growth processes. In
comparison to the homogeneous nucleation that occurs in the bulk of
the solvent–solute film, nucleation at the film/substrate interface
can potentially lead to columnar structures with preferentially oriented
grains guided by the interaction between the perovskite and the substrate
(see Figure S3 for schematics). Because
the activation energy of homogeneous nucleation is larger than that
of the heterogeneous nucleation, it is desirable to first perform
the thermal annealing at a relatively low temperature where only heterogeneous
nucleation can occur,30,31 followed by the ramping up of
the temperature to 100 °C to complete the crystallization/growth
process.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of perovskite thin films (110 nm) annealed (a) at
different low temperatures and (b) at 40 °C followed by different
ramping rates to 100 °C; the ratio of the (110) and (310) peak
intensities are listed on the side for comparison; J–V characteristics of the devices with the
perovskite layer (c) annealed at temperatures corresponding to those
in (a) during the low temperature step followed by 100 °C annealing
(with a fixed ramping rate of 10 °C/min) and (d) processed at
the identical conditions as those presented in (b). For comparison,
XRD and device performance of the fast-annealed sample are also included
in (b,d), respectively.

To obtain a rationally tuned texture structure in perovskite
thin
films, the parameters of the ramp-annealing procedure are further
analyzed. We first explore the low temperature annealing step. Figure 1a shows the XRD patterns
of the CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO samples
annealed for 10 min at 40, 50, and 60 °C. Grains oriented along
the (110) plane are the most predominant, followed by those along
the (310) plane. We then analyze the ratio of the (110) and (310)
peak intensities to illustrate the texture of the film. The largest
ratio is achieved in samples annealed at 40 °C, suggesting that
the film processed at this condition has developed a more textured
structure with a preferred grain orientation. In contrast, at higher
annealing temperatures (50 or 60 °C), it is likely that the nucleation
is induced both inside the film and at the interface, leading to a
more randomly oriented crystal structure. The other critical parameter
that influences the film quality is the ramping rate of the temperature
from 40 to 100 °C. As shown in Figure 1b, the optimized value is 10 °C/min,
which we attribute to the balance between the kinetic-limited and
thermodynamic-limited processes. If the rate is too low, that is,
1 °C/min, homogeneous nucleation may be induced during the long
duration of the temperature ramping up process, whereas at the high
rate (100 °C/min), the growth of the interface-nucleated grains
can be hindered by mass transport. The XRD patterns of samples treated
with other ramping rates are illustrated in Figure S4.

2.2 Correlation between Device
Performance and
Thin Film Texture
To examine how the crystalline quality
and texture of the perovskite film impact the device performance, J–V curves are measured on devices
constructed of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 (110 nm)/PCBM/BCP/Ag. In this structure, CH3NH3PbI3 is the active layer which absorbs light and creates
the photocarriers that are subsequently collected by the anode (ITO)
and cathode (Ag) through the hole-transport (PEDOT:PSS) and electron-transport
(PCBM/BCP) layers, respectively. In Figure 1c,d and Table S1, we show the J–V characteristics
of the devices with the perovskite layer processed at the varying
annealing temperatures or ramping rates corresponding to those exploited
in the films displayed in Figure 1a,b, respectively. These data strongly suggest that
the trend of the device performance closely follows that of the active
layer crystallinity as revealed in the XRD patterns, demonstrating
that the texture of the perovskite film is essential in determining
the device efficiency.

It is worth mentioning that for films
that are not thermally treated (black curve in Figure 1a), an intermediate phase emerges at small
2θ angles (<10°), corresponding to a large lattice spacing
along the out-of-plane direction. This intermediate phase is likely
to consist of CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO (solvent molecule).32−34 Although solvent molecules
can be removed during the fast-annealing treatment, the volume shrinkage
in films that are rapidly undergoing the transition to the crystalline
phase will result in cracks as those observed in the SEM image in Figure S1a. Ramp-annealed samples, on the other
hand, exhibit smooth and compact morphology with minimized density
of cracks, as shown in Figures S1b–d and S2. This is presumably owing to the
removal of solvent molecules during the low temperature annealing
step when the film is still largely amorphous.35 Nevertheless, even though the cracks present on the fast-annealed
sample increase the surface roughness, the film is still continuous
without deep pinholes or shunting paths, as shown in the cross-sectional
SEM images in Figure S1f.

In the
following discussion, we focus on the analysis and comparison
between the fast-annealed sample and the ramp-annealed one treated
under the optimized annealing condition (unless specified), corresponding
to the blue and red curves in Figure 1b,d, respectively, as they represent the two ends of
the spectrum in terms of film crystallinity/texture and device performance.
The ramp-annealed samples outperform the fast-annealed ones in both
the Jsc and the FF, which leads to an
improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 6.3 to 8.7%. The typical J–V curves under the forward and
reverse scans are plotted in Figure S5,
demonstrating a negligible hysteresis for both types of the devices.
The histogram displayed in Figure S6 further
summarizes the performance of more than 40 devices from 10 batches
of samples prepared on different days, where we consistently observe
the enhancement of Jsc and FF, and therefore
improved PCE, in ramp-annealed samples.

The Jsc can also be calculated from
the spectral response of the cell using the equation Jsc = q∫ϕ(λ) × EQE(λ) dλ, where ϕ(λ)is
the photon flux, and EQE, the external quantum efficiency, represents
the ratio between the number of collected charge carriers and the
number of incident photons at a given wavelength. Because EQE measures
how efficiently the cell converts incident light into electrical energy,
it is determined by the product of the light harvesting efficiency,
the carrier transport efficiency, and the charge collection efficiency,
that is, ηLH(λ) × ηCT(λ) × ηCC(λ). Figure 2a displays the corresponding
EQE data of the two devices, where the ramp-annealed one shows consistently
higher quantum efficiency over the entire wavelength range. However,
as illustrated in Figure 2b, the absorbance spectrum obtained from the UV–vis
measurement does not show any noticeable difference between the fast-
and ramp-annealed CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
samples, indicating that ηLH(λ)is not the origin
of the EQE enhancement.

Figure 2 (a) EQE curves corresponding to the fast- and
ramp-annealed devices
with the 110 nm thick perovskite active layer, and the calculated Jsc from EQE (12.8 and 10.1 mA/cm2) matches well with the Jsc extracted
from J–V curves (13.1 and
10.2 mA/cm2). (b) Absorbance spectra of fast- and ramp-annealed
CH3NH3PbI3 (110 nm)/PEDOT:PSS/ITO
samples.

2.3 Impacts
of Thin Film Texture on Charge Collection
and Transport
It is important to point out that the textured
structure of the perovskite layer may impact the carrier transport
efficiency (ηCT(λ)) because of the enhancement
of the long-range structural coherence in the film.36,37 The textured structure could also improve the charge collection
efficiency (ηCC(λ)) because the energy level
alignment and charge transfer at the contacts can be highly dependent
on the surface orientation/termination of the perovskite layer.15,38 To clarify the underlying mechanism of the improved EQE and Jsc in the ramp-annealed devices and to pinpoint
the effects of the thin film texture, we further perform EIS measurements,
which can potentially disentangle processes occurring in the bulk
and at the contact. As shown in the Nyquist plot under 1 sun illumination
(Figure S7a), two arcs are present which
are well-separated in frequency. The associated capacitance and resistance
of each arc is extracted by fitting the impedance data to the equivalent
circuit shown in Figure 3a. To assign the physical processes that correspond to the two arcs,
EIS measurements are performed as a function of applied bias and under
different light intensities at both short- and open-circuit conditions.

Figure 3 (a) Equivalent
circuit for EIS data fitting and the dependence
of capacitances (b) and resistances (c) on light intensity under the
open-circuit condition. (d) Calculated interface recombination time
constants under the short- and open-circuit conditions, respectively,
at different light intensities for both fast- and ramp-annealed devices
(110 nm perovskite layer).

The high frequency arc is associated with a capacitance, C2, on the order of 1 × 10–7 F cm–2, for both ramp-annealed and fast-annealed
samples (Figure 3b).
The magnitude of C2 is fairly constant
with respect to applied bias (Figure S7c) and incident light intensities (Figure 3b), which is consistent with prior reports
which have established this capacitance as the bulk dielectric capacitance
of the perovskite layer.39,40 The capacitance, C1, which is associated with the low frequency
arc, has previously been assigned to ionic or electrical accumulation
layers at the perovskite interface with charge selective contacts,
for example, accumulated holes at the cathode.40,41 While C1 is generally found to increase
with light intensity, the value of C1 for
the ramp-annealed samples is approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger
than that of the fast-annealed ones (Figure 3b).

As shown in Figure 3c, the resistance associated with the bulk
capacitance, R2, can be a few times larger
than the resistance associated
with the interface capacitance, R1, for
both ramp-annealed and fast-annealed samples. Both resistances exhibit
a similar behavior of decreasing with the increasing light intensity
(Figure 3c) as well
as with applied bias (Figure S7c), which
is opposite to the trend observed for the interface capacitance (C1). As recently noted by Bisquert and co-workers,41 these observations suggest that the resistances
are connected to a common process of recombination at the interface.
In this case, the interface recombination kinetics are described by
the time constant given by τs = (R1 + R2)C1. Figure 3d
shows that at the open circuit, τs,oc is consistently
2 orders of magnitude larger for the ramp-annealed samples, indicating
significantly faster recombination at the interface for the fast-annealed
samples. Given this fact, it seems surprising that the fast-annealed
cells produce the same open-circuit photovoltage, Voc, as the ramp-annealed samples. There has been a recent
debate centered on the physical meaning of the low frequency response
(R1 and C1).41−43 Therefore, to test the connection of τs,oc and Voc, J–V curves are also measured as a function
of incident light intensity. Figure 4a shows a plot of Voc versus
intensity for both ramp-annealed and fast-annealed samples. Fits of
these trends to the diode equation reveal a nearly ideal diode quality
factor, γ, of 1.4 for the ramp-annealed samples, whereas γ
is 5.6 for the fast-annealed samples, suggesting that they are controlled
by different recombination mechanisms. A close examination of the Voc versus intensity relation for the fast-annealed
sample further reveals that the quality factor decreases with light
intensity, and a γ of 5.6 is a simple average. This can be attributed
to the filling of trap states or recombination centers associated
with the interfaces by photogenerated carriers, resulting in the gradual
drop of the quality factor to a value close to that of the ramp-annealed
sample under sufficient illumination (>0.2 sun).44 The diode quality factors further accounts for the larger
FF which is consistently measured for the ramp-annealed compared to
the fast-annealed samples.

Figure 4 (a) Light Intensity dependence of Voc for fast- and ramp-annealed devices (110 nm perovskite).
(b) Jsc and PCE dependence on the perovskite
layer
thickness in the fast- and ramp-annealed devices.

The Jsc is found to increase
linearly
with light intensity for both samples (Figure S8). The interfacial recombination time constants are also
determined at short circuit, where τs,sc is found
to be larger than τs,oc for both samples at all light
intensities (Figure 3d). Unlike at the open circuit, however, the time constants of the
ramp-annealed and fast-annealed samples are fairly close at the short
circuit (see Figure S7d for resistances
and capacitances at varying intensity under the short circuit). This
suggests that interfacial recombination may not account for charge
collection losses. It was recently suggested that the collection efficiency
can be calculated from the ratio of the recombination resistance (R1 + R2) at the open
circuit and the short circuit according to ηcc =
1 – Roc/Rsc.41 This analysis produces nominally
identical values of ηcc = 0.985 for the ramp-annealed
samples and ηcc = 0.978 for the fast-annealed samples.
Thus, differences in charge collection efficiencies cannot completely
account for the discrepancy in Jsc observed.
Instead, if this photocurrent discrepancy mainly originates from the
bulk diffusion/recombination processes through differences in the
carrier diffusion length, it should be reflected in the device performance
as a function of the perovskite layer thickness.45−47 By varying
the concentration of the precursor solution, film thickness can be
controlled between 110 and 450 nm, as listed in Table S2. Indeed, the highest PCE for the fast- and ramp-annealed
samples is achieved at the thickness of 200 nm (7.0%) and 290 nm (12.1%),
respectively, as illustrated in Figure 4b, suggesting a longer carrier diffusion length associated
with the latter.

Because the Jsc and PCE variations
between the ramp- and fast-annealed samples are most pronounced at
the perovskite layer thickness of 290 nm, we further perform corresponding
EIS measurements at this thickness which might provide more information
on the recombination parameters under the short-circuit condition.
The associated capacitances and resistances, as well as the derived
recombination time constants are plotted in Figure 5. In contrast to the comparable τs,sc in thin devices, τs,sc of the 290 nm
thick ramp- and fast-annealed samples differs by 2 orders of magnitude,
as shown in Figure 5c, which originates from the larger R1 and R2 in the former (Figure 5b). Recently, it has been argued
that the applied bias in EIS measurements can lead to ionic transport
and polarization of the interfaces in devices with the regular structure,
which consequently interferes with the EIS measurements and changes
the mechanism of recombination from bulk- to surface-dominant.48 The same ionic processes will also lead to a
gradual increase of Rs (defined in Figure 3a) over time and
introduce hysteresis in J–V curves.48,49 Nevertheless, as shown in Figures S5 and S7b, no obvious J–V hysteresis or change in Rs is observed in our experiments, indicating
that the ion migration/polarization issue is not as severe in our
inverted-structured devices. This can be attributed to the surface
passivation effect of fullerene molecules,50 as well as the avoidance of chemical reactions as these occur at
the interfaces between the perovskite and TiO2/Spiro-OMeTAD
in devices with the regular structure.48 Therefore, the larger R1 and R2 as measured in the ramp-annealed sample under
the short-circuit condition (Figure 5b) provide a strong indication that beyond the surface
recombination at contacts, the bulk recombination process is also
suppressed in the ramp-annealed devices, which ultimately leads to
the longer carrier diffusion length, as illustrated in Figure 4b. Note that similar to the
thin devices, significant variation in τs,oc, mainly
contributed by the modulation in C1, that
is, interface capacitance, is also observed between the ramp- and
fast-annealed 290 nm thick samples, as illustrated in Figures S9b and 5c.

under the short-circuit condition for both ramp- and fast-annealed
devices with the 290 nm thick perovskite layer; and (c) calculated
interface recombination time constants under the short- and open-circuit
conditions at different light intensities.

Although there are theoretical predictions that defects in
the
perovskite layer mainly contribute to the shallow traps and thus are
not detrimental to the device performance,51−53 our study suggests
that it is still crucial to improve the crystallinity and texture
of the perovskite layer to boost the device performance. On the one
hand, the recombination at the contacts is expected to be the dominant
loss mechanism in perovskite solar cells.14,54,55 Instead of introducing the interfacial layer
at the contact54−56 or passivating the surface trap states with small
molecules57,58 which could complicate the device fabrication
process, our study demonstrates that the recombination kinetics at
the interfaces can be effectively suppressed simply by the ramp-annealing
treatment via controlling the surface orientations or terminations
of perovskite grains. On the other hand, it is likely that the preferential
crystal orientation in the ramp-annealed sample yields an increase
in the density of low-angle grain boundaries in the polycrystalline
perovskite thin film, which, as compared to the large-angle grain
boundaries, exhibit better carrier transport properties with minimized
bulk carrier recombination.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we demonstrate that the texture of the perovskite
thin film influences both the surface recombination at the contacts
and the carrier diffusion length in the bulk. The combination of the
two effects leads to enhanced performance in devices constructed of
preferentially oriented perovskite thin films. These findings could
aid in the simple design and fabrication of planar-structured high-efficiency
perovskite solar cells.

4 Methods
4.1 Device
Fabrication
PEDOT:PSS solution
(Heraeus Technology Group) was spun onto patterned ITO/glass substrates
(Xinyan Technology Ltd.) which were precleaned in acetone and isopropanol
at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The film was then annealed at 150 °C for
20 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. PbI2 (2.88 g) and
CH3NH3I (MAI, 0.636 g) were dissolved in a 5
mL mixture of dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide and stirred
at 60 °C for 12 h. The precursor solution was then spun onto
the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 15 s and 5000 rpm for another
30 s. For the fast-annealing process, the sample was put on the hotplate
and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The ramp-annealing sample
was first heated at a low temperature (40–60 °C) for 10
min, followed by the ramping and annealing at 100 °C (10 min).
PCBM (2 wt % in chlorobenzene) was spun onto the perovskite film at
1500 rpm for 30 s. The resulting samples were transferred to a vacuum
deposition chamber (Angstrom Engineering), where BCP (5 nm) and Ag
(100 nm) were thermally deposited with shadow masks under a deposition
pressure of ∼3.0 × 10–6 Torr.

4.2 Characterization
Solar cell efficiencies
are characterized in air using a Keithley 2420 source meter and a
Newport solar simulator under 100 mW cm–2 illumination
measured with an NREL calibrated mc-Si detector with a KG5 filter.
Filters are applied to adjust the light intensities from 0.0092 to
1 sun for the J–V measurements
at varied light intensities. The EQE measurements were carried out
on a setup comprising a Xe lamp, a monochromator, a current–voltage
preamplifier, and a lock-in amplifier. The light spectrum was determined
with a monocrystalline photodetector calibrated by the National Institute
of Standard and Technology. Devices were corrected for spectral mismatch
(M) with values of approximately 0.98 < M < 1.01. The film morphology of the perovskite layer
was studied by Hitachi S-4700II field emission SEM with the acceleration
voltage of 15 kV. XRD patterns of the polycrystalline perovskites
were characterized by a Bruker DAVINCI diffractometer using Cu Kα
radiation (Rigaku D/MAX operating at 45 kV and 40 mA). Absorbance
spectra were calculated from the transmission and reflection measured
using a dual-beam Lambda 800 UV/vis spectrometer. EIS was conducted
on an Autolab potentiostat coupled with Nova electrochemical software
using a 50 mV amplitude perturbation and sweeping frequencies from
0.5 to 400 kHz. Capacitance and resistance data were fit using ZView
software (Scribner Associates).
