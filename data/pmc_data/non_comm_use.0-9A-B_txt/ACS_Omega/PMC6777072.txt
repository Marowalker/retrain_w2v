The
carbon nanotube (CNT) pattern plays an important role in various
electronic devices and biological fields for its superior conductivity
and biocompatibility. Herein, we fabricated regularly arranged concentric
multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) rings in a Petri dish by evaporation-driven
self-assembly technology. By adjusting the dispersion ratio, heating
temperature, and solution volume, various MWCNT rings with different
shapes and morphologies were obtained. The variation law of ring radius,
formation range, and ring numbers was processed with statistical analysis.
With fine adjustment of parameters, the control of desired MWCNT rings
can be achieved for further scientific researches. By culturing L929
cells with these rings, oriented cell growth along the rings was achieved,
which is of significance for cell regulation, tissue repairing, and
related biological applications.

1 Introduction
Carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted substantial attention because
of their exceptional electrical, mechanical, and biological performance.1−4 In many scientific research studies, CNTs were used as additives
to enhance the mechanical property and conductivity of bioengineering
scaffolds,5−7 or used for neural signal amplification, disease
treatment, and tissue engineering.8−10 For these applications,
the location and arrangement of cell growth on CNTs are crucial to
achieve the desired experiment effect. In view of this goal, many
remarkable works were carried out on regular CNT patterns, including
parallel CNT lines,11,12 square CNTs,13 individual CNTs,14 and so on.
These CNT patterns were usually prepared by a template, photo-lithography,
or chemical vapor deposition technique.11−13,15,16 Aside from these precision technologies,
evaporation-driven self-assembly provided another alternative technique
for the fabrication of regular nanomaterial patterns.17−21

When the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) dispersion solution
was confined in a circular vessel device, MWCNT will self-assemble
into concentric rings after water evaporation.21 With the solvent evaporation, liquid convection occurred
from inner space to edge to replenish the lost liquid. With the increase
in concentration, parts of solutes dissolved out from the solvent,
and then the solutes were carried to the triple-phase contact line
of vapor–liquid–solid by convection and deposited on
the substrate. With the pinning and receding of the contact line,
regular patterns formed.17−22 Besides the shape of geometric construction, there are also many
other factors affecting the formation of MWCNT rings. In the previous
work,21 the self-assembly mechanism of
MWCNT rings on various substrates with different Hamaker constants
were studied. Besides the mechanism, the regulation of other ring
properties also has significance on specific application scenarios
(e.g., biological effect), including the ring shape, ring position,
ring number, and ring-formation range.

In this work, we studied
the self-assembly of MWCNT rings in a
Petri dish. The influence of reagent ratio, heating temperature, and
solution volume is studied in detail. The properties of ring formation
were analyzed by statistical means. After culturing L929 cells with
MWCNT rings together, the cells achieved selective growth along the
ring direction. By this study, researchers can obtain expected MWCNT
rings with specific parameters, which can be used for their designed
experiments. The as-fabricated MWCNT rings provided feasible induction
cues and scaffolds for regulating cell growth, which has significance
for cell regulation, tissue repairing, and related biological field.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication Diagram of
Concentric MWCNT Rings
As shown in Figure 1a, the self-assembly process of concentric
MWCNT rings is illustrated
by a three-dimensional diagram and its cross-sectional view. At the
initial stage, MWCNTs dispersion was injected in a Petri dish, and
a concave interface was formed due to the combined action of gravity
and capillary force. Then the dish was subjected to bottom heating.
With water evaporation, MWCNTs were continually carried to the triple-phase
contact line of vapor–liquid–solid by convection flow.
With the triple-phase contact line receding and pinning, MWCNTs self-assembled
into concentric rings on the bottom of the Petri dish.

Figure 1 (a) Self-assembly diagram
of concentric MWCNT rings in a Petri
dish. (b) Dispersion diagram of MWCNTs in water. The ball-and-stick
model represents the SDBS molecule. The stick and ball represent the
hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends of SDBS, respectively.

As a commonly used surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate
(SDBS) showed outstanding ability in dispersing CNTs in water among
various surfactants.23 It has decent binding
affinity to CNT sidewalls, which can be ascribed to the benzene ring
forming π–π interactions on CNT sidewalls.24 Such π–π interactions enable
CNTs achieve high dispersion in water.25 As shown in Figure 1b, MWCNTs and SDBS were added to water. After ultrasonication treatment,
SDBS is dissolved in water, the hydrophilic ends head for water, and
hydrophobic ends absorb on the MWCNT surface. With water evaporation,
the concentration of MWCNTs dispersion increases gradually, and some
MWCNTs aggregate into a bundle. Under the action of liquid convection,
the bundles were deposited along the circular triple-phase contact
line and self-assembled into concentric rings.21 Many factors will affect the self-assembly process and
lead to various MWCNT patterns, such as the ratio of MWCNT/SDBS, heating
temperature, and liquid volume. In the following parts, these three
parameters were studied in detail.

2.2 MWCNTs
Self-Assembly with Different MWCNT/SDBS
Ratios
In the preparation of MWCNTs dispersion solution,
SDBS was selected as the dispersing agent to improve the hydrophobic
property of MWCNTs in water. The SDBS content will affect the dispersion
state of MWCNTs, and then influences the self-assembly pattern. The
heating temperature and solution volume were 80 °C and 1 mL,
respectively. As shown in Figures 2 and S1, various ratios
of MWCNT/SDBS were studied from 1:2 to 1:50. The morphologies of MWCNT
rings were recorded along the radial direction of the Petri dish from
the center to outer edge. The white arrows represent the receding
direction of the triple-phase contact line during water evaporation,
and they also show the direction of formation of MWCNT rings from
the center to outer edge (e.g., 1:2 from Figure 2a–d).

Figure 2 MWCNTs self-assembly with different MWCNT/SDBS
ratios. (a–d)
1:2; (e–h) 1:10; (i–l) 1:20; (m–p) 1:50. Scale
bar: 200 μm. The arrows represent the receding direction of
the triple-phase contact line and the direction of formation of MWCNT
rings from the center to outer edge of the Petri dish.

When the ratio is low (1:2), MWCNT rings have some wavy sites
along
the rings (Figure 2a,c). These wavy sites also appear at other ratios, 1:4 and 1:6 (Figure S1). With the ratio increase, the wavy
sites disappeared from 1:10 to 1:50. The edges of MWCNT rings become
smoother. The widths of the rings become larger from Figure 2b,f,j to 2n and from 2c,g,k to 2o. At the outer edges, the continuous MWCNT films gradually change
into individual rings from Figure 2d,h,l to 2p. When the ratio
is too high (1:50), inner particles in MWCNT rings at the outer edge
were discrete and discontinuous (Figure 2p). Additionally, the size of MWCNT bundles
or particles also become larger because the higher SDBS content can
make more MWCNTs disperse in water. When equal amounts of water were
evaporated gradually, more MWCNTs at a higher ratio can aggregate
together into lager bundles or particles than those at a lower ratio.

The ring number and radii of the first ring and last ring were
counted. Figure 3a
shows the statistical approach of R0 and R1 along the radial direction. R0 represents the radius of the first MWCNT ring at the
center position of the Petri dish. R1 represents
the radius of the last MWCNT ring at the outer edge of the Petri dish. R1 – R0 represents
the formation range of MWCNT rings. As shown in Figure 3b, R0 decreases
first, and then increases with the ratios. When the ratio is 1:6, R0 is the shortest, about 4 mm. From Figure 3c, R1 – R0 reaches a maximum
range of about 11.7 mm. Meanwhile, the number of self-assembled MWCNT
rings is also the largest, about 78 (Figure 3d). According to these results, we can fabricate
the most number of MWCNT rings, the widest ring rang at 1:6, and the
least number of MWCNT rings at 1:50.

ratios of MWCNT/SDBS. (c) Variation
trend of R1 – R0 with different ratios of MWCNT/SDBS. (d) Variation trend

2.3 MWCNTs Self-Assembly with
Different Heating
Temperatures
Based on the results in shown in Figure 2, a ratio of 1:10 and volume
of 1 mL were selected for the following temperature study. The heating
temperature will affect the evaporation rate of water, which further
influences the receding rate of the triple-phase contact line and
the aggregation of MWCNT bundles. Therefore, the heating temperature
will also bring change to ring formation. The rings are recorded from
the center to the outer edge of the Petri dish along the radial direction.

As shown in Figure 4a, the first few rings include a small quantity of MWCNTs, the ring
spaces vary from 200 to 400 μm. The quantity of MWCNTs increases
along the radial direction from Figure 4a–d. At the outer edge of the Petri dish (Figure 4d), MWCNT rings connect
with each other, like a film. This can be attributed to the slow receding
rate of the triple-phase contact line, which leads to the continuous
deposition of MWCNTs at a low temperature. With the temperature increasing
from 25 to 120 °C, the receding rate of the triple-phase contact
line becomes faster, and the ring spaces narrow down, which vary from
160 to 240 μm in Figure 4e, 100 to 140 μm in Figure 4i, and 80 to 100 μm in Figure 4m. This trend also appeared
in other positions along the vertical direction in Figure 4, such as 4b to 4n, 4c to 4o,
and 4d to 4p. At the outer edge of the Petri dish, the continuous
MWCNT film transforms into individual rings from 4d to 4h and 4l to
4p. This can be attributed to the higher heating temperature, which
makes the triple-phase contact line recede easier and faster than
at low temperature. Then MWCNTs are deposited as individual rings
along the circular receding triple-phase contact line.

Figure 4 MWCNTs self-assembly
at different heating temperatures. (a–d)
25; (e–h) 50; (i–l) 80; (m–p) 120 °C. Scale
bar: 200 μm. The arrows represent the receding direction of
the triple-phase contact line and the direction of formation of MWCNT
rings from the center to outer edge of the Petri dish.

The variation trends of R0, R1 – R0, and
the ring numbers with heating temperatures are recorded in Figure 5. R0 increases with the increase of heating temperature (Figure 5a). This is because
of the fact that the higher heating temperature leads to more evaporation
within the same time and induces a bigger surface tension for the
receding of the triple-phase contact line. Therefore, the first ring
at high heating temperature has a larger radius than at low heating
temperature. The ring formation range decreases with the increase
of heating temperature (Figure 5b). Meanwhile, the ring number increases first and then decreases
with the heating temperature (Figure 5c). The ring numbers from 25 to 80 °C are close,
and then the numbers fall rapidly from 80 to 120 °C. This may
be caused by the fast thermal movement of MWCNT bundles at higher
temperature, and plenty of MWCNTs are deposited on few rings during
a short self-assembly time.

heating temperatures. (b) Variation trend of R1 – R0 at different heating
temperatures. (c) Variation trend of ring number at different heating
temperatures.

2.4 MWCNTs
Self-Assembly with Different Volumes
In this part, a ratio
of 1:10 and a heating temperature of 80 °C
are chosen for the study of volume effect on MWCNTs self-assembly.
The morphologies of MWCNT rings are recorded along the radial direction
from the center to outer edge of the Petri dish. The ring images at
0.3, 0.7, and 1.5 mL are shown in Figure S2. The average space between the two adjacent rings shows a decreasing
trend along the radial direction with a volume of 0.5, 1, and 2 mL
(Figure 6a–d,e–h,i–l).
The widths of the single rings become wider along the radial direction
at every volume. With volume increase, the width changes of the rings
are the most obvious along the vertical direction in Figure 6 (Figure 6a,e,i, b,f,j, c,g,k, d,h,l). The widths of
rings become wider with the increasing volume. When the volume is
3 mL, the rings nearly disappeared. At the center position, continuous
MWCNT films formed (Figure 6m,n). At the outer edge of the Petri dish, few scatter-like
rings are formed (Figure 6o,p). When the volume is larger than 3 mL (e.g., 4 mL), the
rings completely disappeared. A circular MWCNT film is formed.

Figure 6 MWCNTs self-assembly
with different volumes. (a–d) 0.5;
(e–h) 1; (i–l) 2; (m–p) 3; (q–t) 4 mL.
Scale bar: 200 μm. The arrows represent the receding direction
of the triple-phase contact line and the direction of formation of
MWCNT rings from the center to outer edge of the Petri dish.

As shown in Figure 7a, the radius of the first ring (R0)
decreases with the volume, and then changes a little bit only after
0.7 mL. This indicates that a volume of 0.7 mL can generate rings
at the earliest time. Meanwhile, a volume of 0.7 mL also has the widest
ring range as shown in Figure 7b. Additionally, most ring numbers also appear at this volume
(Figure 7c). According
to these statistical results shown in Figure 7 and morphologies in shown in Figure 6, if the ring number is expected,
a volume of 0.7 mL will be an optimized parameter. If a continuous
MWCNT film is expected, a volume of more than 4 mL will be an optimized
parameter.

volumes. (b) Variation trend of R1 – R0 with different volumes. (c) Variation trend
of the ring number with different volumes.

2.5 Morphology Characterization by Scanning Electron
Microscope and Conductivity Demonstration
To study the micromorphology
of MWCNTs, two types of representative self-assembled MWCNTs were
characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), including the
rings and continuous film. The rings and film were prepared using
1 and 4 mL of solution, respectively, at 80 °C. The ratio of
MWCNT/SDBS is 1:10. Before the SEM characterization, the nonconducting
SDBS was washed and removed by treatment with deionized water and
nitric acid. Figure 8a shows the regular ring formation under a large field of view, about
43 rings. From the enlarged views (Figure 8b,c), it is shown that the ring edges are
smooth, and MWCNTs deposited together into a continuous network, which
ensured its conductivity when used as a circuit. As shown in Figure 8d, when the MWCNT
solution is excess (i.e., 4 mL), the rings transformed into a continuous
film. The film surface has a porous structure (Figure 8e), and MWCNTs intertwined with each other
(Figure 8f). To demonstrate
the conductivity of MWCNT rings, the cylindrical wall of the Petri
dish was dismantled, and green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were fixed
on the rings using silver paste with three modes, including one LED
at free position (Figure 8g), two LEDs at opposite positions (Figure 8h), and three LEDs at average positions (Figure 8i). After applying
a voltage (5 V) on the rings, the green LED can be lighted up immediately,
indicating its good conductivity as a conductive circuit.

line and the direction of formation of MWCNT rings from the center
to outer edge of the Petri dish.

2.6 MWCNT Rings for Regulating Cell Growth
CNT-based devices have wide applications in cell engineering, and
the oriented cell growth on CNT pattern has key function in these
scenarios.8−10,26−28 The oriented growth and proliferation of L929 cells play an important
role in wound repair. The L929 cells can synthesize and secrete plenty
of collagen fiber and matrix components, which promote the formation
of granulation tissue and create favorable conditions for the coverage
of epidermal cells.29−31 In this experiment, the L929 cells were selected
for studying its oriented growth and proliferation on MWCNT rings.

To make it convenient to observe the cell morphologies, MWCNT rings
with low density were used for L929 cell culture. The rings were prepared
at 25 °C with 1 mL of MWCNT dispersion solution. The ratio of
MWCNT and SDBS is 1:10. As shown in Figure 9a–c, L929 cells were seeded and cultured
in a Petri dish without MWCNT rings as a control group. On the first
day, the cells are sparse with normal cellular morphologies. The cell
density rapidly increases with culture time in 2 days (Figure 9b). When the culture reached
3 days, some cells grew into clusters (Figure 9c). All the cells grow randomly in the Petri
dish.

1, (b) 2, and (c) 3 days. L929 cell culture with MWCNT rings for (d)
1, (e) 2, and (f) 3 days. All the cells were processed by pseudocolor
technology. Scale bar: 200 μm.

Compared with the control group, the cells cultured with MWCNTs
showed regular growth along the rings. Some cells showed the growth
tendency along scattered rings with a low cell density. The other
cells grew between two adjacent rings (Figure 9d). With the increasing culture time, the
cell density also increased, and the number of cells on rings clearly
increased. A few number of cells grow between rings. And some of their
pseudopods were connected with the ring edge (Figure 9e). With the proliferation of cells, the
cell density on rings increased, some cells grew into clusters on
rings, most of the cells oriented along the ring direction, and a
few number of cells migrated to the space, like a bridge, between
two adjacent rings (Figure 9f). The selective adhesion and growth of cells on MWCNT rings
can be attributed to the strong affinity between MWCNTs and extracellular
matrix proteins.12 These results indicate
that the as-fabricated MWCNT rings can provide an effective induction
factor for regulating cell growth. The oriented growth and proliferation
of L929 cells proved the feasibility and potential of using as-fabricated
MWCNT rings as a scaffold and inducement for wound healing, tissue
repairing, and related biological applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary, regular concentric MWCNT rings were
fabricated successfully
in Petri dishes. By changing the ratio of MWCNT/SDBS, heating temperature,
and solution volume, the self-assembly of MWCNTs can transform from
rings to films gradually, and the number, radius, and formation range
of MWCNT rings can be tuned. The fine adjustment of parameters provided
a deep understanding of MWCNT self-assembly, and it is of significant
reference value for controlling the self-assembly of other nanomaterials
in the Petri dish system. The rings can be used as a circular circuit
for other electronic devices due to their conductive property. When
culturing L929 cells with MWCNT rings, the cells showed oriented growth
and proliferation along the ring direction, which proved the feasibility
and potential of using MWCNT rings as a scaffold and inducement for
cell engineering, such as oriented cell growth, tissue repairing,
and related biological applications.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of MWCNT Dispersion Solution
The MWCNT powder was purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co.
Ltd and used without further purification. The fabrication method
of MWCNTs was chemical vapor deposition. SDBS was purchased from Sigma.
A mixture of MWCNT and SDBS with different ratios were put in water
(30 mL) and sonicated at 100 W for 2 h. The weight of MWCNTs was fixed
at 1.5 mg. Then the dispersion solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm
for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the self-assembly of MWCNT
rings.

4.2 Fabrication of MWCNT Rings
When studying
the ratios, the solution volume and heating temperature were fixed
at 1 mL and 80 °C, respectively. When studying the heating temperatures,
the ratio of MWCNT/SDBS and solution volume were fixed at 1:10 and
1 mL, respectively. When studying the solution volume, the ratio of
MWCNT/SDBS and heating temperature were fixed at 1:10 and 80 °C,
respectively. The Petri dish was purchased from Beijing Hualide Technology
Co., Ltd, the inner diameter was 35 mm, and the constituent material
is polystyrene.

4.3 Characterization of MWCNT
Rings and L929 Cells
The morphologies of the MWCNT rings
were recorded by using an optical
metallographic microscope (DM 2500, Leica) with a HC PLAN s objective
(10 × 25 Br. M). The micromorphology of MWCNT rings and films
was characterized by SEM (SU 8020). The heating process was carried
out on a heating plate. Before the cell culture and SEM characterization,
the SDBS on MWCNT rings was dissolved many times by immersion in deionized
water and nitric acid.32−34 To make it convenient to observe the cell morphologies,
MWCNT rings with low density were used for L929 cell culture. The
rings were prepared at 25 °C with 1 mL of MWCNT dispersion solution.
The ratio of MWCNT and SDBS is 1:10. The L929 cells were seeded in
the Petri dish and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U mL–1 penicillin,
and 100 μg mL–1 streptomycin. The L929 cells
were incubated in a cell incubator with a humidity atmosphere containing
5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively.35,36
