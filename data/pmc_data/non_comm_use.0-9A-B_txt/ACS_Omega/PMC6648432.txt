A metal-free synthesis of aryltriphenylphosphonium
bromides by
the reaction of triphenylphosphine with aryl bromides in refluxing
phenol is developed. This reaction tolerates hydroxymethyl, hydroxyphenyl,
and carboxyl groups in aryl bromides, allowing to synthesize multifunctional
aryltriphenylphosphonium bromides, from which facile access to multifunctional
aryldiphenylphosphines and their oxides by hydrolysis and subsequent
reduction is exemplified. A two-step addition–elimination mechanism,
with the elimination step being a fast step, is also proposed.

Introduction
Aryltriphenylphosphonium
salts have been widely used in organic
synthesis as catalyst,1−3 aryl source,4 supporter,5 and ionic liquid.6 They can also be used in the preparation of hydrogen storage materials7 and nonlinear optical chromophores.8 [18F]-labeled aryltriphenylphosphonium as an
imaging agent was employed for monitoring mitochondrial disease.9 Four methods have emerged for the synthesis of
aryltriphenylphosphonium salts by the reactions of Ph3P
with (1) aryl radicals in situ generated by CoCl2-catalyzed
reaction of Grignard reagents with aryl bromides (Scheme 1A),10 (2) diazonium salts (Scheme 1B),11 (3) aryl halides catalyzed
by nickel (Scheme 1C),12 and (4) aryl halides or pseudohalides
catalyzed by palladium (Scheme 1D).13−15 These methods require using either a metal catalyst
or unstable, explosive diazonium salts. In the absence of metal, few
aryltriphenylphosphonium salts have also been prepared from Ph3P and aryl halides but require very high temperature (>260
°C).16−18 Jugé and co-workers19 have reported a method based aryne chemistry for the preparation
of P-stereogenic tetraarylphosphonium triflates at room temperature,
but this method suffers from the use of expensive starting material
and poor regioselectivity. Herein, we report a synthesis of aryltriphenylphosphonium
bromides from Ph3P and aryl bromides (Scheme 1E) not only in the absence
of metal but also at around 182 °C, a temperature comparable
to that for the nickel-catalyzed method (Scheme 1C).

Scheme 1 Methods for the Synthesis of Aryltriphenylphosphonium
Salts
Results and Discussion
As mentioned above, the reported metal-free synthesis of aryltriphenylphosphonium
salts from Ph3P and aryl halides requires very high temperature
(>260 °C),16−18 we initially hypothesized that using Ph2PCy instead of Ph3P would lower the reaction temperature
due to the stronger nucleophilicity of Ph2PCy than Ph3P.20 To test this hypothesis, we
chose 4-bromobiphenyl as a model compound for aryl halides. Screening
solvents with a boiling point of around 200 °C revealed that
tetraline (bp 207 °C) and PhCN (bp 191 °C) gave phosphonium
salt 1 in yields less than 10% but phenol (bp 182 °C)
afforded 1 in an excellent yield (92%) (Table 1, entries 1–3). Ethoxybenzene
(bp 169 °C) gave 1 in 6% yield (entry 4). Replacing
phenol with 2-chlorophenol (bp 175–176 °C) could also
produce phosphonium salt 1 albeit in a lower yield (entry
5). This substantial decrease of reaction temperature by using phenol
as a solvent encouraged us to test the reaction of Ph3P
with 4-bromobiphenyl. Surprisingly, the corresponding phosphonium
salt 2 was also obtained in an excellent yield (93%,
entry 6), suggesting that higher nucleophilicity of Ph2PCy has no effect on the course of the reaction, whereas using PhCN
as a solvent still led to a very low yield (5%, entry 7). For 4-iodobiphenyl,
the corresponding phosphonium salt 3 was obtained in
51% yield (entry 8), whereas for 4-chlorobiphenyl, only a trace of
the product was detected (entry 9).

The success in the synthesis of
phosphonium salt 2 from Ph3P and 4-bromobiphenyl
promoted us to examine
a variety of aryl bromides. As shown in Table 2, polyaromatic aryl bromides such as 2-bromonaphthalene,
2-bromoanthracene, 9-bromophenanthrene, 4-bromo-1,1′:4′,1″-terphenyl,
and 1-bromopyrene gave the corresponding phosphonium salts 5–9 in 69–90% yields. For heteroaromatic
5-bromo-1H-indole, phosphonium salt 10 was obtained in 82% yield. The hydroxymethyl group was tolerated
as phosphonium salts 11 and 12 were obtained
in 74 and 60% yields, respectively. 1,4-Dibromobenzene gave monophosphonium
salt 13a (29%) with the concurrent formation of bisphosphonium
salt 13b (7%). When 3 equiv of Ph3P was used,
the yield of 13b was increased to 76% (13a: 8% yield). 1-Bromo-4-phenoxybenzene gave the corresponding phosphonium
salt 14 in a nearly quantitative yield. For 2-bromo-6-methoxynaphthalene,
however, we found that a demethylation product 15b formed
in 14% yield besides the normal product 15a (72%). The
demethylation is possibly through a mechanism similar to that for
the K2CO3-catalyzed cleavage21 of aryl alkyl ether by PhSH (with phenol and Ph3P to replace PhSH and K2CO3, respectively),
but attempts to isolate anisole failed probably because of its low
boiling point (bp 154 °C). The demethylation also happened for
1-bromo-3-methoxybenzene as phosphonium salt 17 formed
in 34% yield with the concurrent formation of phosphonium salt 16 (27% yield), which could be separately obtained in 95%
yield from 3-bromophenol. However, 4-bromophenol gave phosphonium
salt 18 in a low yield (26%) though 2 equiv of 4-bromophenol
was used. 3-Bromotoluene and 4-bromotoluene afforded phosphonium salts 19 and 20 in 63 and 82% yields, respectively,
and the latter reaction was carried out using 2 equiv of Ph3P and at increasing concentration of reactants. 2-Bromobenzoic acid
and 4-bromobenzoic acid gave zwitterionic phosphonium salts 21 and 22 in 75 and 58% yields, respectively,
and the latter reaction required 2 equiv of 4-bromobenzoic acid and
an increasing concentration of reactants. Phenyl 4-bromobenzoate gave
phosphonium salts 23 in a 73% yield, whereas methyl 4-bromobenzoate
led to a complicated mixture including phosphonium salt 21, a demethylation product, and phosphonium salt 23,
an ester-exchanging product as indicated by thin layer chromatography
(TLC). It is noteworthy that carboxylic acids and esters are not tolerated
for the nickel- or palladium-catalyzed formation of phosphonium salts
from Ph3P and aryl bromides.12,13

Although the precise
reaction mechanism remains unclear, the nucleophilic
addition ability of Ph3P to a variety of electron-deficient
alkenes or alkynes22,23 promotes us to propose a two-step
addition–elimination mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2A, for the formation of phosphonium
salts from Ph3P and aryl bromides. The first step is nucleophilic
addition of Ph3P to aryl bromide 24 to form
a zwitterionic intermediate 25, and the second step is
the elimination of bromide to restore the aromaticity of the ring
and furnish phosphonium salt 26. In both steps, phenol
may form hydrogen bond with bromide to facilitate the addition of
Ph3P and the elimination of bromide by further polarizing
the carbon–bromide bond, rendering phenol the optimal solvent
among the tested solvents (Table 1, entries 1–4 and 6–7). The reason that
aryl bromide gives the best yield among the tested aryl halides (Table 1, entries 3 and 8–9)
is possibly because triphenylphosphine as a soft nucleophile24 prefers to attack the softer carbon bonding
to bromide than that to chloride due to less charge on the carbon
when softer Br– (than Cl–) is
leaving in the transition state, whereas both aryl iodide and phosphonium
iodide might be unstable in refluxing phenol. As the reaction is carried
out in phenol, a weak acid, we wondered if the intermediate 25 could undergo proton exchange with phenol. Therefore, we
performed a deuterium experiment using d4-1,4-dibromobenzene 27 as a substrate and expected that
after the formation of zwitterionic intermediate 28,
it could abstract a proton from phenol to produce phosphonium salt 29, which could lose a deuterium to generate the zwitterionic
intermediate 30 and consequently produce phosphonium
salt 13a-d3 after the elimination of bromide
(Scheme 2B). However,
after the isolation of the formed phosphonium salts, and the analysis
by NMR (1H, 13C, and 31P) and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) indicated that only phosphonium salt 13a-d4 formed (some bisphosphonium salt 13b-d4 also formed), and no phosphonium salt 13a-d3 was detected. This result suggests that the second
step in our proposed mechanism (Scheme 2A) is probably too fast to allow D–H exchange
between the phenol and the intermediate 25. Another possibility
is that the tripheylphosphonium cation and the carbon anion in the
intermediate 25 might form a relatively intimate ion
pair and the former blocks the latter to access phenol due to steric
hindrance. As for the much lower yield of phosphonium salt 18 than that of phosphonium salt 16 (Table 2), one possibility is that 18 could be deprotonated by Ph3P to form a ylide,
4-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, which might undergo
polymerization via Wittig olefination (Scheme 2C).

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation
of Aryldiphenylphosphonium Bromides
Aryltriphenylphosphonium salts can be readily hydrolyzed25 to aryldiphenylphosphine oxide, which can be
further reduced to aryldiphenylphosphine by a number of methods.26−29 Therefore, the feasible and metal-free synthesis of aryltriphenylphosphonium
salts from Ph3P and aryl bromides and its good tolerance
of functional groups enable facile access to multifunctional aryldiphenylphosphines
and their oxides. For example, treatment of phosphonium salt 12, which was obtained in 60% yield (Table 2) from Ph3P and 4-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)phenol,
with 3 M NaOH afforded phosphine oxide 31 in 57% yield,
and the subsequent reduction27 with methyldiethyoxysilane
catalyzed by bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate gave phosphine 32 in 55% yield (Scheme 3). Although the yield of each step is moderate, this two-step route
to phosphine oxide 31 or three-step route to phosphine 32 is still attractive because it requires neither transition
metal nor protection of two hydroxyl groups.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Multifunctional
Aryldiphenylphosphine and Its Oxide
In summary, we have developed a metal-free method for
the synthesis
of aryltriphenylphosphonium salts from Ph3P and aryl bromides.
This method can be applied to aryl bromides bearing a variety of functional
groups such as CH2OH, Ar-OH, and COOH. The reaction temperature
is comparable to the reported method12 using
nickel as a catalyst. Further conversion of the resulting aryldiphenylphosphonium
salt by hydrolysis and reduction also provides access to multifunctional
aryldiphenylphosphines and their oxides without using transition metals
and protection groups. Furthermore, a two-step addition–elimination
mechanism is proposed, with the second step to eliminate a bromide
being a fast step as indicated by the deuterium experiment.

Experimental
Section
General
All chemicals were purchased from local companies
and used as received. All reactions were performed under nitrogen
by connecting the flask to a nitrogen balloon. The reflux was operated
by using a heating mantle. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. The IR spectra
were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 IR spectrometer. The
HRMS spectra were recorded on a Varian 7.0 T FTMS.

Typical Procedure
for the Synthesis of [1,1′-Biphenyl]-4-yl(cyclohexyl)diphenylphosphonium
Bromide (1)
To a round-bottom flask (5 mL),
4-bromobiphenyl (233 mg, 1 mmol), Ph2PCy (268 mg, 1 mmol),
and phenol (1.5 mL) were added. The resulting mixture was refluxed,
and the reaction was followed by TLC. After completion (5 h), the
reaction mixture was passed through a short silica gel (25 g) column
eluted first with EtOAc to remove phenol and then with 1,2-dichloroethene
(DCE)/MeOH (5:1, v/v). The latter fraction was evaporated under reduced
pressure and then dried at 110 °C until no residue of solvent
was detected by 1H NMR. By this procedure, phosphonium
salt 1 was obtained as a pale yellow solid in 85% yield
