Torrefaction
pretreatment has recently gained attention for the
potential improvement in biomass properties. Otherwise, visible image-processing
technology for analyzing properties of torrefied biomass was evaluated
for possible use in the future online process control. In this study,
torrefied rice husk from different torrefaction temperatures (180–330
°C) was obtained. After torrefaction, the biochar was characterized
to determine the effects of torrefaction temperature on the properties,
including the proximate analysis, solid yield (SY), and higher heating
values. In addition, the color values, including red-green-blue (RGB)
values, and grayscale (GS) of torrefied rice husk, were measured.
The results show that the fixed carbon and ash increased from 17.39
to 35.13 and 7.06 to 38.41%, respectively, while volatile matters
decreased from 71.47% to a minimum of 22.89% with the increase of
torrefaction temperature from 105 to 330 °C. The SY remained
higher than 46% even at the most severe torrefaction condition because
of the high ash content and high remaining lignin. Moreover, the higher
heating values of torrefied rice husk were increased from 14.80 to
17.82 MJ/kg when increased the pretreatment temperature. RGB values
were decreased with the increase of torrefaction temperature. The
GS analysis results show that the color of torrefied rice husk changed
from yellow to brown at light torrefaction and black at severe torrefaction.
GS of torrefied rice husk shows a good correlation (R = 0.9998) with torrefaction temperature. Prediction equations with
higher fitting degree between GS and proximate analysis (R2 > 0.9900), high heat values (R2 = 0.9999), and SY (R2 = 0.9979),
which are developed to reflect the changing characteristics of torrefied
rice husk. The results show that the prediction method based on GS
is a promising technology to measure the properties of torrefied rice
husk.

1 Introduction
Biomass is considered
as an environmental friendly fuel by producing
less greenhouse gas compared to fossil fuel.1 Raw biomass is characterized by high moisture and oxygen content,
low energy, and the fibrous nature, causing the poor grindability
and hygroscopic nature.2−5 These limitations make it complicated to be used on a large scale,
enormously affecting the logistics and final energy performance. Therefore,
in order to defeat these defects, pretreatment technologies are needed
to make biomass appropriate for energy applications. Torrefaction,
also known as mild pyrolysis and low-temperature thermal pretreatment,
is carried out in an inert environment at 200–300 °C,
with a residence time from a couple of minutes to several hours.6−10 During the thermal degradation process, cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin, three major components of biomass, undergo different reactions,
leading to a three-stage reaction: moisture removal, main decomposition,
and formation of fixed-carbon.11 During
the torrefaction, cellulose is slightly degraded, hemicellulose mostly
decomposed while most lignin remains, producing solid bio-char, liquid
bio-oil, and combustible gas, which can meet different energy needs.
With the oxygen content departing as moisture and light matter volatiling,
the amount of functional groups containing oxygen is reduced.12 However, the torrefaction characteristics and
properties such as high heat values (HHVs) and solid yield (SY) remain
unknown until complicated testing techniques are used to examine the
torrefied biomass. In the past, numerous correlations regarding proximate,
ultimate, or near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy analysis have
been developed to predict the characteristics of raw and torrefied
biomass,13−16 but these correlations were specifically developed to predict the
HHVs of biomass, while other properties, such as the SY, might not
show great correlation with the aforementioned analysis.17 Moreover, the proximate, ultimate, and NIRS
analysis would take several hours to provide the measurement results,
time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, developing other more accurate,
faster, and higher-efficiency prediction methods will be the research
trend in the coming future.

Color values including red (R),
green (G), and blue (B) value are
the trichromatic colors and primary compositions of an image.18 After torrefaction, the color of biomass was
changed from yellow to brown or black,19,20 which could
be matched with the color values of torrefied biomass. Different ratios
of the R, G, and B value could present torrefied biomass under different
conditions with different properties. However, each pixel of picture
might have more than 16 million (255 × 255 × 255) color
schemes which make it impossible to analyze the correlation between
the red-green-blue (RGB) values and characteristics of torrefied biomass.21 For example, Sarrafzadeh et al.22 applied a RGB color analysis to measure the cell concentration
of three microalgae and reported that the RGB color analysis showed
poorer prediction than gray analysis.

Grayscale (GS) is the
color value of a sample pixel representing
only an amount of light, that is, it carries only intensity information.23 GS is defined to be a method that uses black
as the basis color and different saturation to display the image.
There would be no more than 255 GS values to predict the properties
of torrefied biomass. Wang24 conducted
an experiment on the biochar absorption characteristics based on GS
analysis and reported that there was a strong positive correlation
between adsorption characteristic and GS of biochar from the continuous
pyrolysis reactor. Lindström et al.21 reported that visible and near-infrared imaging techniques for analyzing
characteristics of torrefied biomass would be a promising online detective
technology in future. With the application of GS analysis, online
prediction of the properties of torrefied biomass would be realized.

To author’s best knowledge, there is limited publication
on color values analysis of torrefied biomass and lack of such a study
on developing a prediction method based on GS for torrefied biomass
properties. In this study, the proximate analysis, HHVs, and SY of
torrefied rice husk obtained from the fixed bed reactor are examined
first. Then, digital image processing (RGB values analysis) and GS
analysis of torrefied rice husk are analyzed for the first time. We
explore the color value analysis method and evaluation equations for
the quantification of the proximate analysis, HHVs, and yields of
torrefied rice husk. This work would provide detail information of
torrefied rice husk and develop a simple and inexpensive online measurement
method in predicting the properties of torrefied rice husk.

2 Materials and Experimental Methods
2.1 Materials
Rice husk from Meizhou,
China, was used as the feedstock for this study. The test code use
RH and TRH as raw rice husk and torrefied rice husk, respectively.
Before experiments, raw biomass was ground into pulverized particles
by a mill. Then, the powders were shifted by a sieve to control the
particle size to be smaller than 20 meshes. The sieved biomasses were
dried in a blast drying oven at the temperature of 105 °C for
12 h to provide a basis for torrefaction experiment. Proximate analysis
of rice husk shows that moisture, volatile matter (VM), fixed-carbon,
and ash content were 4.07, 71.47, 7.06, and 17.39, respectively. The
high heat value (HHVwb) of rice husk is 14.82 MJ/kg, which
is in the wet base.

2.2 Torrefaction Procedure
Figure 1a shows
the schematic diagram
of torrefaction experiment, while Figure 1b is the digital picture of torrefied rice
husk. The torrefaction device is a fixed bed reactor consisting of
a quartz tube with an outside diameter of 38 mm and a length of 1200
mm. In each run, the pulverized powder with the total mass of 20 g
(±1%) was first placed in the middle of the quartz tube, and
then nitrogen gas (99.99%, purity) was purged through the tube at
a flowrate of 150 mL/min (25 °C) to provide an oxygen-free atmosphere
and remove volatile products from the tube during torrefaction. Then,
the reactor was heated to the desired temperature (180–330
°C with a difference of 30 °C) with the same residence time
of 20 min and the heating rate of 10 °C/min. After reaching the
target temperature, started the stopwatch, and when it reached the
target residence time, took out the sample to cool down in the air
with nitrogen continuously purging through the tube. The torrefaction
experiment under any given conditions was carried out triple to minimize
the relative errors.

digital
picture of torrefied rice husk.

2.3 Properties of Torrefied Rice Husk
After
torrefaction, the proximate analysis (ISO/DIS 17246), SY (eq 1), and HHVs (ASTM D5865-2007a)
analysis were conducted to investigate the properties of the torrefied
biomass. Furthermore, the enhancement factor (EF) (eq 2) of HHVs25 and energy yield (EY) (eq 3)26 were analyzed in order to reflect
the changes of energy more intuitively. 1  where massTRH and massRH were the remaining mass of torrefied rice husk and raw rice husk,
respectively. 2  where HHVTRH and HHVRH were the HHVs of torrefied rice husk and raw rice husk,
respectively. 3  

2.4 Scanned
Image Processing and Color Value Analysis
Torrefied biomasses
were first scanned by a scanner (EPSON PERFECTION
2480 PHOTO) to obtain the digital colorful images. Then, the RGB values
were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software, and twenty pixels in
the obtained image were picked up random. The conversion correlation
between RGB values and GS was shown in eq 4, which was used in Adobe Photoshop. The correlations
between GS and properties of torrefied biomass were analyzed by Origin
9.1 and fitting software 1stOpt from 7D-Soft High Technology Inc. 4  

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Proximate Analysis and
Yields of Torrefied
Rice Husk
The proximate analysis, SY, and HHVs of RH and
TRH are presented in Table 1. The moisture content remained less that 5%, mainly because
of the destruction of hydroxyl group (−OH) of biomass feedstock,
and the torrefied biomass losses the capability to form hydrogen bonds
with water.27 That is, the torrefied rice
husk became hydrophobic. The VM, fixed carbon (FC), and ash content
were changed greatly at severer torrefaction. Both FC and ash were
increased while the VM content was decreased with the increase of
torrefaction temperature. The VM content decreased from 71.47% to
a minimum of 22.89% when increased temperature from 105 to 330 °C,
while FC and ash increased from 17.39 to 35.13 and 7.06 to 38.41%,
respectively.

330	3.56	22.89	35.13	38.41	46.20	17.82	
HHVs and SY were two
of the most important factors to characterize
the fuel properties of biomass. The effects of torrefaction temperature
on the HHV of torrefied rice husk are shown in Table 1. The HHVs were enhanced, and the SY was
decreased with the increase of torrefaction temperature. HHVs increased
from 14.80 MJ/kg and reached a maximum at 330 °C of 17.82 MJ/kg,
which were consistent with the results of Cai et al.28 Ash and FC climbed up with the increase of torrefaction
temperature, and FC, which has the greatest influence on the total
energy, increased obviously.24 Therefore,
with the increase of carbonization temperature, the great increase
of FC leads to the growth of HHVs. In addition, the increase in HHVs
was ascribed to the removal of moisture and light matters in raw biomass.17 Specifically, in the torrefaction process, the
degradation of fiber contributes to the removal of oxygen and increment
of carbon, resulting in the enhancement of HHVs.29 The SY of TRH deceased from 94.31 ± 2.57% to a minimum
of 46.20 ± 1.86% (wt) when increased the torrefaction severity.
Moreover, the SY remained higher than 46% even at the most severe
torrefaction condition (330 °C) because of the high ash content
in the rice husk feedstock30 and higher
remaining lignin content in torrefied rice husk. The most abounded
component in the raw rice husk was lignin (39.05 wt %), which changed
slightly after torrefaction.28

As
shown in Figure 2,
EF was increased from 1.00 to 1.20, which illustrates that the
HHVs were improved up to 20%. Though the EY decreased from 100 to
55.54% with the increase of torrefaction temperature, the EY was greater
than the mass yield—an effect which became more remarkable
for higher temperature pretreatment, and this shows the fact that
the enhanced HHVs of torrefied biomass cannot keep up with the weight
loss; thus leading to decreased total energy of biomass as the torrefaction
temperature rose.31,32

3.2 Color Values Analysis
3.2.1 Color Value Changes during Torrefaction
Table 2 shows the
R, G, and B value and GS of RH and TRH. With the presentation of Figure 1b and the results
obtained from RGB analysis for all samples, it shows a significant
color variation with torrefaction temperature. The R, G, and B values
were decreased with the increase of torrefaction temperature.

TRH
with different properties obtained in different torrefaction
conditions was finally characterized by different GS, shown as Figure 3. The GS first decreased
fast and then slowly with the increase of torrefaction temperature,
which indicated that the color changing during torrefaction was more
obvious than other higher temperature thermal conversion process,
such as pyrolysis and gasification. The GS analysis shows that torrefied
rice husk changed from yellow to brown at light torrefaction and black
at severe torrefaction. The increase in darkness of torrefied rice
husk could be the result of a nonenzymatic reaction between reducing
sugar and amino acid in the thermal degradation process.33 The changes in color could reflect the changing
characteristics of torrefied rice husk.

Figure 3 GS evolution of torrefied
rice husk.

Equation 5 is the
regression analysis result between GS and temperature. The fitting
coefficient R2 is 0.9998, which means
that the GS of torrefied rice husk is closely related to the torrefaction
temperature. 5  

3.2.2 Proximate Analysis Prediction
According
to the previous analysis, the proximate analysis and GS value of the
feedstock and torrefied rice husk show regular changes with the torrefaction
temperature. It is reasonable to deduce that there is an existing
equation relation between the proximate analysis and GS value of rice
husk. To figure out the optimal evolution between proximate analysis
and GS of the biochar samples, correlation analysis was conducted
between GS, volatile, FC, and ash. Their experiment values and fitting
evolutions are shown in Figure 4a–c. As shown, they all change dramatically before
60 with the increase of GS, while then changed slowly, especially
the curve of ASH, which almost leveled off. The changing curves of
proximate analysis values all conform to the ExpAssoc model in the
Origin Basic Function category.

Figure 4 Correlation of GS with VM (a), FC (b),
and ASH (c).

Equations 6–8 were the corresponding
regression relations. It
can be seen that FC has the highest prediction accuracy, ASH takes
second place, and VM has the lowest, but the fitting coefficients R2 were all higher than 0.9900, which mean the
gray value can explain the change of proximate analysis value to the
extent of more than 99%. Thus, the ExpAssoc model can accurately predict
the corresponding proximate analysis results, according to the gray
value of torrefied rice husk after torrefaction or during torrefaction,
which could be conveniently obtained within couple of minutes with
the help of this developed prediction methods. 6   7   8  

3.2.3 HHVs
Prediction
The use of biomass
as a fuel in thermal applications requires knowledge of its higher
heating values, but the determination of HHVs used to be time-consuming
and expensive,34 so it is eager to find
out a more economical and efficient prediction method. As analyzed
above, both higher heating values and GS have a close relationship
with torrefaction temperature, therefore, it is feasible to predict
HHVs by GS. According to the experiment values of HHVs and GS, correlation
analysis was conducted by Origin 9.1, and it can be found that their
optimal fitting model conform to Boltzmann in Origin Basic Function
category (Figure 5 and eq 9). HHVs closely corrected
with GS of the torrefied rice husk with a strong unlinear correlation,
whose fitting coefficient R2 was 0.9999.
Therefore, the effects of HHVs of biochar samples could be perfectly
predicted by GS, which is cheap and convenient. 9  

Figure 5 Correlation of GS with HHVs.

3.2.4 SY and Thermal Behavior Prediction
The values of SY changed with the increase of GS are shown in Figure 6, which climbed up
dramatically before the GS value of 100, and then kept steady almost.
The model fits into Asymptotic1 in the Exponential category, and the
corresponding fitting regression analysis equation is shown as eq 10, and the fitting coefficient R2 was 0.9979. The color values were closely
relative to the SY of torrefied rice husk. That is, gray values could
be explained the changes of SY in the sample biochar more than 99%.
Therefore, by image recognition technology and with the help of the
related equations, GS of torrefied rice husk could be obtained and
then used to be predicted the values of SY, which is convenient and
of high accuracy. 10  

Figure 6 Correlation of GS with SY.

4 Conclusions
In this
paper, a prediction method for the properties of torrefied
biomass based on GS was developed. It was found that the higher heating
values of torrefied rice husk were increased with the increase of
torrefaction temperature, while the SY showed the opposite trend.
The regression equations with a fitting degree higher than 0.99 were
obtained between the GS value and proximate analysis, HHVs, and SY.
The results obtained from this study suggest that GS analysis has
strong potential to be developed into a promising approach for rapid
quantification of torrefied biomass properties.
