Hyperpolarized (HP)
xenon-129 (Xe) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
has the potential to detect biological analytes with high sensitivity
and high resolution when coupled with xenon-encapsulating molecular
probes. Despite the development of numerous HP Xe probes, one of the
challenges that has hampered the translation of these agents from
in vitro demonstration to in vivo testing is the difficulty in synthesizing
the Xe-encapsulating cage molecule. In this study, we demonstrate
that a pseudorotaxane, based on a γ-cyclodextrin macrocycle,
is easily synthesized in one step and is detectable using HyperCEST-enhanced 129Xe MR spectroscopy.

Introduction
Hyperpolarized (HP)
xenon-129 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
has the potential to become a molecular imaging platform for safely
producing highly resolved three-dimensional images of biochemical
phenomena through the use of xenon-capturing molecular probes. Currently,
the most prevalent molecular imaging techniques, positron emission
tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography, involve
the administration of radiolabeled chemical probes. Other methods
for enhancing MR sensitivity, such as parahydrogen-induced
polarization, signal amplification by reversible exchange, and dissolution
dynamic nuclear polarization, and dynamic 1H imaging techniques,
such as paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer, involve
the difficult synthesis of molecular probes using parahydrogen, specific isotopes, or toxic metal ions before the imaging
experiment is performed.1−3 Contrastingly, molecular probes
based on the pseudorotaxanes described herein are simple to synthesize
and the inclusion of the nonradioactive, nontoxic 129Xe
isotope occurs spontaneously in situ.

Xe gas can be inhaled,
and its biodistribution can be imaged using
an MRI instrument with a broadband coil.4−6 HP Xe atoms cannot, by
themselves, be tuned to target particular regions in the body, but
targeted HP Xe biosensors that are capable of binding both biochemical
receptors and xenon atoms in vivo have been postulated as a new molecular
imaging platform.7−9 Employing hyperpolarized nuclei and a saturation
transfer pulse sequence, known as HyperCEST, provides up to a billion
times sensitivity enhancement compared to that of thermally polarized
nuclei, allowing for picomolar concentrations of the Xe-encapsulating
probe to be detected.10,11

We recently disclosed the
first in vivo images of an HP Xe probe
in a live animal using the millimolar quantities of the nontargeted
Xe cage, cucurbit[6]uril (CB6).12 This
work demonstrated that molecular probes can be imaged in vivo via
HyperCEST, but despite this work and numerous other prototypes,8,13−25 targeted HP Xe MRI biosensors have yet to be used for in vivo imaging
in a whole animal. The development of these potential biosensors has
not been slowed by a lack of interest in the techniques or by barriers
in MRI technology. In our opinion, the problem is more fundamental:
the supramolecular hosts that encapsulate xenon are difficult to synthesize
and functionalize, so sufficient quantities of the targeted probes
for in vivo imaging are simply not available.

Herein, we describe
the development of a new class of water-soluble
HP Xe biosensors that use a pseudorotaxane to encapsulate HP Xe and
can be imaged using a HyperCEST pulse sequence. The modular nature
of the probes and their facile synthesis should allow for the rapid
development of targeted molecular probes for HP Xe MRI (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Proposed binding of Xe
via formation of a ternary complex and detection
via HyperCEST.

Until recently, the hollow,
ball-shaped molecular cages, known
as cryptophanes, appeared to be privileged structures in the field
of HP Xe imaging.26−28 Cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) have
also been reported as HP Xe probes,11,29,30 but the larger cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) does not show
any affinity for Xe. α, β, and γ-cyclodextrins (CDs),
which are truncated cone-shaped macrocycles composed of six, seven,
or eight d-glycopyranoside units, are some of the most commonly
used hosts in supramolecular chemistry,31 and they would be ideal components of 129Xe probes because
they are nontoxic and water soluble (Figure 2). Unfortunately, either α, β,
and γ-CD fail to bind Xe in aqueous media or the reversible
binding has too fast of an exchange rate to form a distinct peak that
is observable by129Xe NMR at room temperature.32,33

Figure 2 Structures
of hosts and guests used in this study.

We hypothesized that macrocycles that were too large to bind
Xe
on their own, such as CB8, β-CD, and γ-CD, could be threaded
with long alkyl chains to create pseudorotaxane complexes that were
capable of forming a ternary complex with Xe (Figure 1).34 Rotaxanes
are well-known supramolecular species composed of a molecular axle
that is threaded through a tube-shaped host, creating a noncovalently
bound structure. To serve as a Xe cage, the inner diameter of the
rotaxane macrocycle must be large enough to fit both the molecular
axle and a Xe atom in its hydrophobic core. However, a macrocycle
that is too large would not be detectable using HyperCEST because
the Xe would exchange in and out of the host at a rate that is too
high to support HyperCEST detection. Prior to this work, the only
precedent for the formation of this kind of ternary complex with Xe
was reported by Cohen, who showed that a pillararene could simultaneously
bind hexane and Xe.35 To test the aforementioned
hypothesis, we designed a series of new pseudorotaxanes based on cucurbiturils
and cyclodextrins to determine their potential as xenon hosts.

Results
and Discussion
Three cucurbiturils (CB6, CB7, and CB8) and
three cyclodextrins
(α, β, and γ-CD) were chosen as the host molecules.
These six macrocycles were threaded with 8- and 10-carbon molecular
threads that contained terminal ethylimidazolium groups, which served
to enhance the water solubility of the hydrophobic alkanes and enabled
facile detection by mass spectrometry (1 and 2).36 In all of the cases studied, the
rapid formation of threaded complexes was observed by mass spectrometry
and 1H NMR, though most cases showed rapid host–guest
exchange on the NMR time scale.

Analysis by 129Xe
NMR identified the promising scaffolds
that combined the desired attributes of facile synthesis with MR detectability
via HyperCEST. For the HP Xe studies, we used a custom-built fritted
phantom inside a custom dual-tuned 1H/129Xe
radiofrequency (RF) coil to acquire all free induction decay (FID)
spectra. The aqueous solutions of the pseudorotaxanes were placed
inside the fritted phantom, and HP Xe was introduced below the fritted
phantom, creating microbubbles that percolated vertically through
the sample. A series of saturation prepulses at a variety of chemical
shift offsets were loaded into user interface software of the GE Achieva
3T MR scanner. Spectra with different saturation prepulses were acquired
approximately every 6 s.

As expected, irradiation at +128 ppm
(relative to the peak corresponding
to xenon gas) produced a 67% depletion for a sample of unthreaded
CB6, thus confirming that our experimental method was reliable (Table 1, entry 1). However,
it should be noted that contrary to previous reports, we did not observe
a HyperCEST signal for CB7 (entry 4).37 None of the studies with cucurbituril-derived pseudorotaxanes produced
any HyperCEST attenuation (entries 2–3, 5–6, and 8–9),
likely indicating that there is not sufficient space to bind xenon
in the cavity of the supramolecular complex.

b Depletion of the peak corresponding
to unbound Xe. Samples were dissolved in water (2 mL, 10 mM), and
one-dimensional 129Xe spectra were recorded. HyperCEST
spectra were subsequently acquired using a series of off-resonance
pulses varying by 5 ppm.

Gratifyingly, we found that cycodextrin-based pseudorotaxanes reversibly
encapsulated Xe and could be detected by 129Xe magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. HyperCEST depletions of 43 and 52% were observed
for the γ-CD containing C8 and C10 diethylimidazolium
bars (2 ⊂ γ-CD and 1 ⊂
γ-CD, respectively, entries 17 and 18). Like CB6, the maximum
HyperCEST depletion for the γ-CD pseudorotaxanes occurred when
the samples were irradiated at a frequency of +128 ppm, relative to
the Xe gas-phase signal. HyperCEST depletion spectra for 1 ⊂ γ-CD are shown in Figure 3. Importantly, the magnitude of the HyperCEST
depletion for 1 ⊂ γ-CD was comparable to
that of CB6, a xenon cage that we have recently shown to be amenable
to in vivo HP Xe MRI.12

and on-resonance (+128 ppm, center) HyperCEST pulses. HyperCEST depletion

γ-CD (right). Each data point indicates the HyperCEST depletion
when the molecule is irradiated with a pulse at a given chemical shift
offset.

1H NMR also confirms
the formation of the ternary pseudorotaxane–xenon
complex [(Xe·1) ⊂ γ-CD, Figure 4]. Formation of the pseudorotaxane
with γ-CD and 1 can be monitored by an upfield
shift in the triplet corresponding to the proton attached to the C3
position in the cyclodextrin. This proton is positioned on the interior
of the macrocycle, so it is shielded when the pseudorotaxane forms.
Subsequent binding of xenon further shifts the C3–H peak upfield,
indicating that the xenon also binds to the interior of the macrocyclic
host. No shifts of the protons corresponding to the ethylimidazolium
groups of the host pseudorotaxane are observed. Whereas these spectra
might not, by themselves, be definitive evidence for the formation
of the proposed ternary complex, when considered in the context of
the HyperCEST data shown in Figure 3, the data are consistent with the formation of a ternary
complex. Importantly, the control experiments in entries 10, 13, and
16 of Table 1 show
that xenon does not form a binary complex with cyclodextrins that
can be detected by HyperCEST.

NMR spectrum after addition of 1 equiv of 1. (C) 1H NMR spectrum after addition of 1.5 atm xenon.

The formation of the pseudorotaxanes was observed
by mass spectrometry.
Additionally, NMR and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) binding studies
were used to characterize the most promising pseudorotaxanes.38 The association constant, Ka, for 1 ⊂ γ-CD was determined
by NMR in pure water to be 2.94 × 103 M–1 at 300 K, and the Ka for 2 ⊂ γ-CD was determined to be 4.10 × 103 M–1 at 300 K. ITC was also used to corroborate
the Ka for 1 ⊂ γ-CD
in pure water, 1.00 × 104 M–1 at
300 K. Importantly, ITC in fetal bovine serum also showed formation
of the pseudorotaxane complex, though the binding affinity was two
orders of magnitude lower, 1.01 × 102 M–1 at 300 K. This indicates that the pseudorotaxanes form in complex,
biological media, so they could find application as hyperpolarized
xenon biosensors.

Conclusions
The data shown herein
indicate that two parameters can be used
to predict the ability of a pseudorotaxane to form a ternary complex
with xenon. First, the pseudorotaxane must form a 1:1 host–guest
complex. Our data does not probe a wide range of host–guest
association constants, but it appears that an affinity on the order
of 103 is sufficient. Second, the pseudorotaxane must contain
an internal hydrophobic cavity with a volume of approximately 164–176
Å3 (Table 1, entries 1, 17, and 18). These parameters explain why all
of the pseudorotaxanes with hosts besides γ-CD failed to bind
Xe; they simply did not have a large enough internal cavity. α-Cyclodextrin
also has a cavity that is of sufficient size to bind Xe (174 Å3, entry 10), and this binding has been previously reported;32 however, the chemical shift of the bound complex
is 3 ppm away from the peak corresponding to dissolved xenon, too
close to be observed, as our HyperCEST pulse is ∼10 ppm wide.

It should be noted that the pseudorotaxanes that we are describing
herein are markedly distinct from the rotaxane-based HP Xe probes
that have been recently described by Dmochowski, Pines, and Francis.19,39 In those cases, a threaded CB6 structure was synthesized that could
not bind Xe, but when the thread was severed, either by action of
an enzyme or by a change in pH, the CB6 was released, and a signal
was observed. These probes represent a creative approach for synthesizing
“turn on” HP Xe sensors; contrastingly, the rotaxanes
that we describe herein are a new scaffold that is capable of producing
an HP Xe signal via formation of a ternary binding motif.

The
data shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 were
obtained using a Phillips Achieva 3T clinical whole-body MR
scanner, which provides significant advantages over conventional NMR
spectrometers, namely, the ability of performing whole-body imaging
experiments. These advantages come with some trade-offs, specifically
the ability of acquiring HyperCEST depletion spectra with a Lorenzian
fit line, such as in the data processed for cryptophane and cucurbituril
agents, as demonstrated by others using high-field, high-resolution
NMR spectrometers.11,39−42 However, the use of a clinical
scanner bodes well for eventual clinical translation of our techniques
to in vivo experiments, which we recently demonstrated using a nontargeted 129Xe contrast agent.12

In
conclusion, we have discovered a novel method for synthesizing
potential HP Xe probes using pseudorotaxane structures of γ-CD.
These supramolecular complexes form a novel ternary structure in the
presence of HP Xe, which can be detected via 129Xe MR spectroscopy.
Current efforts in our laboratories are dedicated to synthesizing
rotaxane-based probes that will not dissociate and in the application
of these new probes for targeted molecular imaging.

Experimental
Section
NMR HyperCEST Detection
Natural abundant 129Xe gas was polarized to 26–30% using a Xemed polarizer (Xemed,
Durham, NH). Next, 1.0 mL of sample was drawn into a glass frit cell
using a syringe. The cell was then inserted into a custom RF coil
tuned to the Larmor frequency of 129Xe (35.33 MHz) at 3T,
where HP 129Xe gas was introduced to the vessel from the
Tedlar bag in the pressure chamber, which was pressurized at 35 kPa
above atmosphere. The solution was mixed with HP 129Xe
gas as it passed through the fine fritted disc and produced several
microbubbles, which continuously dissolved into solution and exited
the vessel through the outflow tube. The concentration of 129Xe at any point during the experiment was between 1 and 10 mM. A
Philips Achieva 3T clinical scanner was used to collect all NMR spectra.
The RF pulse length was determined with the use of ref B1, a parameter of Philips MR scanners. The pulse length
and flip angle were used to calculate the amplitude of the RF pulse
and field strength. In this study, the B1 field strength was determined by the scanner to be 15.9 μT.
In the acquisition of NMR spectra, a pulsed saturation prepulse train
consisting of 96–20 ms 3-lobe sinc pulses with 0 ms pulse intervals
was applied at various chemical shift offsets. Free induction decay
(FID) spectra were acquired at various chemical shift frequency offsets,
approximately 5 ppm apart. Each FID spectra was acquired approximately
6 s apart. Off-resonance FID spectra were obtained quarterly in this
series and acquired with a saturation prepulse at +271 ppm off-resonance
from the gas-phase peak. A HyperCEST depletion spectrum was collected
for each sample (see the Supporting Information) by measuring HyperCEST depletion at various frequency offsets from
the Xe gas-phase peak. A minimum of three spectra were obtained at
each of the various chemical shifts, and a plot of the mean signal
depletion as a function of the frequency of the chemical shift offset
(z-spectrum) was produced. The mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained
from all control spectra for individual samples was used in the measurement
of signal depletion. The SNR for each spectrum was calculated using
MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). To measure signal depletion, the mean
HyperCEST saturation spectrum SNR was subtracted from the mean control
spectrum SNR. This difference was then divided by the mean control
spectrum SNR to produce the signal depletion by the HyperCEST effect.
