Valorization of agri-food organic
waste in order to reach zero
waste using cleaner methods is still a challenge. Therefore, both
anaerobic co-digestion (ACD) (biological process) and adsorption (physicochemical
process) were used in combination for this objective. ACD allows the
activation of biodegradable organic matter by microbial action and
produces a digestate (co-product). This coproduct was used as a raw
material to produce porous carbon having a high specific surface area
after chemical treatment using sulfuric acid and thermal activations
at temperature T = 350 °C. The resulted material
was used for the preparation of core–shell particles with a
core made of porous carbon and a shell consisting mainly of alginate
and a calcium ion layer. The final core–shell particles were
then used for dye treating wastewater and solving the solid–liquid
separation problem in the adsorption process. We show here that in
the ACD process, significant bio-methane potential (BMP) was produced.
Furthermore, the data indicate that 153 L CH4 kg·SV–1 of BMP was produced under optimum conditions of pH
= 8 and inoculum/load ratio = 1.2. The overall results concerning
the methylene blue (MB) adsorption from water onto the core–shell
particles show the occurrence of a maximum adsorbed amount equal to
26.178 mg g–1, and good agreement was found between
the experimental adsorption data with pseudo-second-order and Langmuir
theoretical models. The response surface methodology coupled with
the central composite design has allowed the identification of optimal
conditions for MB removal and has led to the elucidation of adsorption
mechanism and the regeneration of the adsorbent without the occurrence
of the solid/liquid separation problem.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the increase of water contamination by organic
matter (OM) has led to the increase of toxic organic waste and energy
requirements resulting in worldwide problems.1−3 Hence, more
than 10–15% of 10 000 types of toxic organic dyes released
into the aquatic environment are originating from the industrial manufacturing
operations.4 Moreover, the increased organic
waste amounts are mainly because of the increase of the inhabitant
number.2 These wastes also lead to a very
deep energy problem resulting in the lack of renewable sources such
as water, coupled with environmental risks related to fossil fuels.5−7 For a long time, researchers and industrialists have devoted their
knowledge and paved the ways necessary to solve these pollution and
consumption energy problems.8 Adsorption
and anaerobic co-digestion (ACD) processes were used with high efficiencies
to address these environmental issues.9−21 However, it is worth noting that these processes often have disadvantages,
such as the recovery mass in the adsorption process, the separation
of liquid and solid phases after adsorption, and the resulting coproducts
(digestate) from the anaerobic process.22−34 Nonetheless, significant limitation is that each technique can manage
only one of the numerous ecological issues. Therefore, the key factor
to address and/or to efficiently manage these environmental issues
is to use coupled procedures leading to synergistic effects and, hence,
improve the productivity.35

Nowadays,
carbonaceous materials (e.g.: bio char, activated carbon,
carbon nanotubes, etc.) have been of great interest in several fields
such as energy conversion and storage, and organic pollution remediation.36−39 The preparation of these materials was performed by several activation
modes, including physical, chemical, and biological. However, biological
activation (biological modification) may be an effective route as
compared to other modes.40−43 Such biological activation of the OM based on the
use of ACD, constitutes multiple processes and allows the production
of a very important renewable energy (methane) and a coproduct (digestate)
which will in turn lead to the preparation of functional carbonaceous
materials. These materials are characterized by their marked adsorptive
properties resulting from their large surface area, the presence of
functional groups on the surface and its tunable electrical surface
with the aqueous phase pH.36 The prepared
carbonaceous adsorbent from the modified digestate shows a high removal
efficiency of methylene blue (MB) from water. Furthermore, the effect
of ACD on the adsorbent properties can be discriminated by the increase
of parameters such the pH, zeta potential, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area, CEC, and AEC as reported in Ref. 44.44

The aim of the present work is to biologically
activate four agri-food
organic wastes using ACD at 38 °C, which allows the production
of a very large amount of methane, thanks to the use of biologically
modified digestate. The latter was used to prepare a carbonaceous
material having a bead shape with a 400 μm layer, for MB removal
from water (Figure 1). The bead-shaped carbonaceous material was selected in order to
avoid the drawback related to the adsorbent regeneration. Indeed,
several studies have shown the effectiveness of the bead-shaped materials
in the removal from water of toxic dyes, in the separation phases,
as well as in the adsorbent regeneration.30−34 On theother hand, alginate has recently received
considerable attention for powder immobilization to prepare bead materials
because of the alginate ability to form hydrogels with metallic divalent
cations such as Ca2+.4,45 This work can be summarized
in three big parts:In the first
part (ACD): we described a facile synthesis
of the inoculum used for OM degradation by the ACD process. Then,
the physicochemical characterization of different wastes was investigated
by the measurements of temperature, aqueous phase pH, conductivity,
alkalinity, turbidity, heavy metal concentration, COD, BOD, and other
physicochemical parameters (NO3–, NH4+, TH, SV, SM, and ST). The bio methane potential
(BMP) of wastes was studied using a design of experiments (DOE) by
the response surface methodology coupled with the central composite
design (RSM-CCD). After this, the kinetics of methane production and
the optimization of digestion process monitoring were investigated.

In the second part (preparation of core–shell
particles for solving the solid–liquid separation problem):
the digestate obtained after the ACD process was used as a carbonaceous
material in the form of core–shell particles and the protocol
of preparation was detailed. Furthermore, the electrostatic attraction
occurring between alginate, calcium (Ca2+) ions, and carbonaceous
material leads, hence, to the formation of core (carbonaceous)–shell
(alginate–calcium ions) particles

In the third part (adsorption of MB): in this part of
work, the key parameters that affect the adsorption of MB have been
studied. Furthermore, the kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption processes
of dyes as well as the surface response methodology (RSM) were reported
to get better insights into the adsorption process. Finally, the regeneration
tests, thermodynamic studies, and mechanism of adsorption were investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Results of the Physicochemical Characterization
of Wastes Used in This Work
Table S1 shows the measured values of pH and volatile solids (VS) for each
substrate used in this work. As can be observed in Table S1, the substrates contain mainly OM with a very high
amount in the loss of dairy product (LDP), compared with other wastes.
The high OM amount of the LDP can be explained by the strong presence
of the sweet and polysaccharide compounds.

The physicochemical
characterization of the mixture of wastes (Table 1), shows an acidic pH, an average conductivity
of 15.04 mS cm–3, a fairly high content of volatile
fatty acids (VFA), concentrations of COD and BOD5 largely
exceeding the Moroccan standards, the presence of large amounts of
nitrates and phosphates, and low concentrations of heavy metals. On
the other hand, Table 1 indicates the presence of a high level of calcium and magnesium
(conductivity of 15.04 ms/cm, 1543 mg/L of Ca2+ and 856
mg/L of Mg2+), which is due to the nature of the substrates
used in this work. However, the concentration of both elements does
not exceed the limits of the inhibition medium for digestion (excessive
amounts of calcium lead to precipitation of carbonate or phosphate
and Mg2+ ions at high concentrations have been shown to
stimulate the production of single cells).46 As can be seen in Table 1, the waste mixture was characterized by medium alkalinity
with significant VSs equal to 36.1 g L–1. Table 1 also shows the non-biodegradability
of the inoculum compared with that of the substrate. The ratio COD/BOD5 = 1.96 < 3 (in the case of inoculum) while in the case
of the substrate it was = 4.72 > 3.47

Table 1 shows the
value of ammonia concentration, which is a major inhibitory factor
in the ACD process. According to the literature, the inhibitory limit
of TAN concentration that can cause a 50% reduction in methane production
ranges from 1.7 to 14 g L–1.46 In our case, the ammonia concentration was found to be
164.18 mg L–1, which is beneficial for our anaerobic
process because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for anaerobic microorganisms.
Physicochemical characterization makes it possible to assess the feasibility
of applying the process of ACD for methane energy recovery.

2.2 Kinetics of Methane Production and Digestion
Process Monitoring
Methane production kinetics is a key parameter
for the ACD process. It provides information on the growth kinetics
of microorganisms and the speed of OM transformation. The kinetic
study of 20 ACD experiments (Figure 2a) shows the appearance of two phases, one rapid in
the first 3 days and the second is slow with a plateau-like behavior
lasting for 12 days. A higher BMP is found near pH 8 with a 15 day
TRH, which is consistent with other studies.48,49

Figure 2 ACD
of agri-food organic waste (a) BMP as a function of time, (b)
pH variation during the ACD process, and (c) BMP as a function of
the volume inoculum/feedstock ratio at different pH values.

Figure 2b shows
that the BMP increases with the increase of the ratio (inoculum/load),
and it is more significant in the reactors with pH = 8. At this pH
value, the variation of the ratio (inoculum/load) from 0.22 to 0.80
promotes an increase of BMP by +105 L CH4 kg SV–1. VS reduction is important at pH 8 compared to another pH. In fact,
78.38% of the OM has been removed near this pH. In the case of reactors
with pH = 7 and pH = 9, increasing the ratio (inoculum/load) from
0.28 to 0.80 was in favor of an increase of the BMP by +30.16 L CH4 kg SV–1.

After the ACD process, the
final pH changed to acidic values for
an initial pH = 7, probably because of the high concentration of organic
acids. The system shutdown in reactors 3, 5, 10, and 11 was explained
by the accumulation of ammonium and VFA in the medium which blocks
the system.23 Nevertheless, when initial
pH = 8, the final pH changed to alkaline pH (Figure 2c). These results show that the digestate
resulting from this process can be used for possible applications,
especially in the retention of positively charged dyes such as MB.
The monitoring of the ACD process was performed by Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) analysis. Figure S1 shows
the appearance and disappearance of certain functional groups with
a large change in the intensity during ACD. The FTIR spectrum before
ACD shows the presence of different vibrations; Table S2 reports all the vibrations before and after ACD.50,51 The same analysis after ACD allowed us to detect differences in
band positions with intensities. It is, therefore, likely that some
of the OM has turned into CH4. Indeed, a wide band located
at 1100 cm–1 probably attributed to the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching of phosphodiesters or polysaccharides and
polysaccharide substances present in milk has disappeared and been
replaced by another band and may be assigned to the −C–O–
groups.50 In addition, all the other peaks
are displaced and their intensities decrease, more precisely the peaks
of −C–O–, −C=O–, and −O–H.
This confirms the degradation of OM present in agri-food waste.

2.3 Modeling of the ACD Process
The experimental
results of the CCD matrix were used to elaborate a quadratic polynomial
equation (eq 1). The
statistical and predictive qualities of this equation have been examined
by several statistical tests (Table S3).24,52,53 The analysis of the variance
shows a P-value less than 0.05, which confirms the
significance of the model in terms of the correlation between the
experimental data. Figure S2 confirms the
normality of the residues and the absence of the aberrant points.29 In addition, coefficients of determination values
indicate a good fit between the experimental and calculated results
by the model (Table S3). The significance
of the coefficients was examined using the P-value
(Table S3). Indeed, all coefficients are
significant at 5 or 1%, except the interaction between the pH and
the load (P-value = 0.46 > 0.05). 1  

2.4 Optimization of ACD Using
CCD-RSM
The process of transforming
the OM on methane has been optimized
and the interactions between different
factors were investigated. Thus, eq 1 was used for constructing response surfaces (3D) and
contour plots (2D) as shown in Figure S3; 3D and 2D presentations allow us to see the distribution of the
responses (methane yield) as functions of different independent variables
(pH, load, and inoculum). The responses of the methane yield essentially
depend on the experiment operating conditions. Therefore, the most
significant yields are always recorded in the centers of the experimental
domains and more precisely at pH 8. Figure S3 summarizes the 3D and 2D presentations. In a more profound and specific
way, we can see:Figure S3a (plan inoculum–pH):
in this presentation, the response surface is a parabolic form, which
shows that the significant responses are concentrated in the center
of experimental domains. Indeed, the variation of pH from 6.27 to
8 favors a considerable increase of the methane yield (from 2.71–173.08
L·CH4/kg SV). The variation of pH above pH 8 makes
the process transformation difficult and the OM reduction was gradually
decreased; these variations are proportional to the decrease in the
inoculum volume with a load fixed at 180 mL.

Figure S3b (plan load–pH):
the same parabolic form in Figure S3a,
has been observed in this plane and the large yield values are recorded
at pH 8. The pH and load variation have a positive influence on the
methane production especially when the pH is around 8 and the charge
is in the range of 180 ± 10 mL.

Figure S3c (Plan inoculum–load):
this plan makes it possible to examine the influence of the inoculum
and the load when the pH is equal to 8. The present plan shows that
an inoculum/load ratio between 0.5 and 0.7 is recommendable to have
a relatively high BMP.



These results
were used to determine the optimal conditions
of the ACD process. Nevertheless, during the optimization process,
several criteria were taken into consideration and not just the methane
yield. These criteria are as follows :Minimize alimentation pH to values below 8.

Minimize the inoculum volume versus volume
of waste.

Produce a large quantity of
methane with a final pH
close to neutral at the end of the process (stabilized digestate).



Table S4 presents
the different proposals
chosen during this work. According to Table S4, the pH can be optimized at 7.40 with an acceptable methane yield
of 152 ± 1.23 L. The comparison of anaerobic mono- and co-digestion
of agri-food organic wastes under optimum conditions showed that methane
production was strongly affected by the substrate ratios. Therefore,
the BMP has been increased 9.92, 5.92, 2.52, and 4.14 times for LDP,
physicochemical sludge (PCS), and liquid biological sludge (LBS),
pure whey (PW), respectively. These results could be explained by
the increase of microbial diversity provided by mixing the four substrates,
which contributed to the increased consumption of the OMs in this
mixture.54 For instance, Maragkaki and
co-workers showed that the biogas production can be increased by adding
other wastes to the sewage sludge without affecting the operation
of existing digesters and without requiring additional facilities,55 this is in agreement with our observations.
In addition, Vivekanand showed that the methane yields were up to
84% higher than the weighted average of the methane yields obtained
with the individual substrates for ACD of whey, manure, and fish ensilage.56

Biogas production from agri-food is very
promising to generate
renewable energy. The present results were compared with others cited
in the bibliography in terms of treatment efficiency and cumulative
methane production and showed a good performance.57−59 For example,
Amon et al. reported that manures received from contrasting dairy
systems were anaerobically digested. The resulting methane yield ranged
between 125 and 166 L·CH4/kg SV depending on the milk
yield and diet of the dairy cow.58 In addition,
Ince et al., 1998, showed the performance of a laboratory-scale two-phase
anaerobic digestion system treating dairy wastewater, and the results
showed an overall 90% COD and 95% BOD removal.59

Another study of Berna Kavacik reported the production
of biogas
by different mixtures of cheese, whey, and dairy manure: the rate
of methane production was determined and showed a value of 1.510 m3 m–3 d–1 at hydraulic
retention times (HRTs) of 5 days in the mixture containing 8% total
solid matters at 34 °C. Despite the different temperatures of
digestion, the results are consistent. In addition, Rajesh Banu and
coworkers tested the performance of treatment of dairy wastewater
using anaerobic and solar photocatalytic methods. In this work, it
is not only the temperature of digestion that differs but the system
of digestion by the substitution of a batch reactor by a laboratory-scale
hybrid up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. The maximum loading
rate was found to be 19.2 kg COD/m3 day with 84% of COD
removal.48,49 The findings suggest that our optimum conditions
found by the RSM-CCD technique for the co-anaerobic treatment process
would be a promising alternative for the treatment of agri-food organic
wastes.

2.5 Characterization of TDAW@alginate Beads for
MB Adsorption
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
(Figure 3a–c)
was adapted to show the morphological characteristics of our spherical
material. The SEM images show a spherical shape in the order of 1
mm (after drying) with homogeneously distributed pores on the surface.
The membrane created by the carboxylic groups of the alginate and
the Ca2+ ions was observed using mapping analysis (Figure 3d–f); this
membrane almost uniformly buries particles. In addition, the presence
of Ca2+ ions is very concentrated in the shell of each
bead while in the core it was lower (immobilization of the TDAW material
inside the core–shell). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
analysis (Figure S4) confirms the previous
results. Therefore, in the shell of the TDAW@alginate beads, the atomic
percentage of calcium (7.23%) is very high compared with that in the
core (0.35%). The same remark was observed for the percentage of carbon
and oxygen, very low in the shell and the opposite in the core with
the presence of impurities that characterize our material: Al (0.04%),
P (0.01%), S (0.38%), Ca (0.35%), and Fe (0.37%). The morphologically
interesting SEM images, the distribution of the elements shown by
the mapping, and the percentage of chemical elements present on the
surface confirm the synthesis of TDAW@alginate.

Figure 3 SEM and mapping analyses
of the prepared core–shell particles:
(a–c) topographic images. (d) Carbon distribution, (e) oxygen
distribution, and (f) calcium distribution on the TDAW@alginate surface.

The nitrogen physisorption measurement
was used to characterize
the porosity of the TDAW@alginate material (Figure 4). The specific surface area of our carbonaceous
material was equal to 471.85 m2/g,53 and after the preparation of the beads, the surface was decreased
to 20.50 m2/g (Figure 4a). The decrease in the BET values was explained by
the fact that the surface area of TDAW was coated with Ca2+ ions and alginate, which in turn lead to the blockage of the carbonaceous
material pores and only a part of pores appears. In addition, nitrogen
physisorption analysis shows a combination of type II adsorption–desorption
isotherms and the plot of pore distribution indicates that mesopores,
which were not coated with alginate after drying, are predominant
(Figure 4b).

Figure 4 (a) BET analysis
and (b) pore size distribution of the TDAW@alginate
particles.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was performed to
characterize the oxygen-containing functional groups in the surface
of porous carbon material. In Figure 5a–c the surface of TDAW constituted mainly of
sp2-bonded carbon, C–OH, and C=O bonds. The
sp2-bonded carbon atoms were detected at 284.99 eV, C–OH
broad peaks were confirmed at 286.2 eV, and C=O bonds were
observed at 288.45 eV.29,60 The deconvolution of the O 1s
band shows three crests at 530, 532, and 533 eV assigned to O atoms
in phenolic and ether and carbonyl O atoms in anhydrides and lactones,
whereas the third peak is attributed to the O groups in carboxylic
acid groups.61 Nevertheless, impurities
were observed in the TDAW structure related to the starting biomass
and the reagents used for the preparation of TDAW.

and normalized XPS spectra of TDAW C 1s
(b) and TDAW O 1s (c).

2.6 Effect of the TDAW@alginate Bead Dose and
the MB pH Solution
The effect of the TDAW@alginate mass was
investigated under the following conditions: 40 mL of MB solution,
an initial dye concentration of 10 mg·L–1,
an adsorbent–adsorbate contact time of 100 mn, room temperature
for the adsorption process, and normal pH. Figure 6a shows the curves of UV–visible absorption
spectra measured after a contact time of 100 min, at different adsorbent
dosages. It can be seen that the MB removal increases with the increasing
adsorbent mass. The higher adsorption capacity at a lower adsorbent
amount was explained by the availability of active sites in TDAW@alginate
(more surface area and pores).

Figure 6 (a) Effect of the adsorbent dose, (b)
point zero charge of the
TDAW@alginate adsorbent, and the (c) effect of the pH solution on
the adsorption of MB over TDAW@alginate.

The effect of pH on the adsorption of MB onto TDAW@alginate
was
also evaluated (Figure 6a,c). It was found that the pH of the MB solution has a critical
impact on MB removal. When the pH of the solution was very acidic
(pH = 3), the removal of MB was very low, which may be related to
the proton H+ competition with MB for the available adsorption
sites.33 On the other hand, when pH >
pHPZC (Figure 6b), the removal of MB was increased from 5.44 to 95.21%. In
alkaline
pH (Figure 6c), the
surface of the TDAW@alginate was negatively charged, which is in favor
of the electrostatic attraction forces occurring between TDAW@alginate
and the MB cations.32

2.7 Effect of the Contact Time on the Removal
of MB
The effect of the contact time was investigated in
the interval of 5–120 min at different temperatures (25, 30,
and 40 °C). Figure 7a–c shows the UV–visible absorption spectra as measured
at different values of the contact time and temperature. It was found
that the increasing temperature from 25° to 40 °C has slightly
increased the MB removal efficiency. Therefore, these results indicate
that the adsorption of the dye onto TDAW@alginate is a thermodynamically
controlled process. Thus, our data are in agreement with the reported
studies according to which the temperature has a positive influence
on the mobility of the MB molecule.62,63 The optimum
values of the equilibrium contact time and the temperature in the
present work were found to be 120 min and 40 °C, respectively.
Bare alginate beads were used for MB adsorption as shown in Figure S5a. The experimental results show that
alginate bare beads have an adsorption rate of 12.24% (at 40 °C),
13.23% (at 40 °C), and 17.09% (at 40 °C) compared with TDAW@alginate,
which shows the effectiveness of the TDAW adsorbed MB molecule (Figure 5a).

Figure 7 Effect of the contact
time on the extent of MB removal (a) at 298,
(b) 303, and (c) 313 K; (d) pseudo first and (e) second order plots.

The pseudo-first-order (PFO) and
the pseudo-second-order (PSO)
adsorption kinetic models were investigated in order to determine
the mechanism of the adsorption process. Figure 7d,e shows the linear plot of PFO and PSO
models and Table 2 summarizes
the different kinetic constant parameters obtained. From Table 2, it can be seen that
the adsorption capacity qe,cal obtained
from the plots of ln(qe – qt) versus t (Figure 7d) and the
experimental value obtained at equilibrium (qe,exp) are not identical compared with those obtained from
the PSO (Figure 7e).
In addition, the value of the correlation coefficient found by PSO
was higher (R2 > 0.99) than that of
the
PFO model. It comes out that the processes of MB adsorption on TDAW@alginate
follow the PSO model.

The intra-particle model has been widely used to study
the diffusion
mechanism.64,65Figure 5b presents the intraparticle diffusion plot
of MB adsorption onto TDAW@alginate, which shows no linear form (the
linear plots did not pass through the origin). In general, if a plot
of Qt against t0.5 is linear and passes through the origin,
the adsorption is entirely governed by the intra-particle diffusion.
In contrast, the adsorption process is controlled by a multistep mechanism.66 Based on these results, we conclude that the
external mass transfer of MB molecules from an aqueous phase to the
surface of TDAW@alginate was the first step in the adsorption mechanism:
diffusion from the film to the particle surface: the adsorbate molecules
are transported from the bulk liquid phase to the adsorbent external
surface through a hydrodynamic boundary layer or film.65,66 Then, in the second stage, the MB molecules are diffused inside
the pores and the last step is related to the adsorption uptake.

2.8 Adsorption Isotherms and Thermodynamic Parameters
To find the equilibrium adsorbed amount of MB onto TDAW@alginate,
the initial dye concentration was varied as depicted in Figure 8a. The adsorbed MB amount increases
with the increasing initial dye concentration up to a plateau value.
This behavior is explained by the strong gradient of MB concentration
and the lack of active sites in TDAW@alginate, which makes the transfer
of mass between the material and the liquid phase difficult. However,
the removal efficiency is gradually decreased to values below 45%
and adsorption equilibrium was achieved at a concentration of 15 mg/L.

amount, (b) adsorption data fitted with Langmuir model and (c) adsorption
data fitted with Freundlich model.

The adsorption isotherm of MB onto TDAW@alginate has been
compared
to both Langmuir and Freundlich theoretical models. The Langmuir model
indicates the achievement of a homogeneous adsorbed monolayer whereas
the Freundlich model shows the heterogeneity of the surface with multilayer
adsorption.67−71Figure 8b,c shows
the linear shapes of both models and the different parameters calculated
are presented in Table S5. The correlation
between the experimental and calculated data using both models was
tested. The correlation coefficient shows a good fit in the case of
Langmuir (R2 = 0.9984). The values of RL (=0.145–0.032) and n (calculated using
the Freundlich equation) show a favorable adsorption of MB onto TDAW@alginate,
which confirms that the adsorption of MB onto TDAW@alginate is a monolayer.
In addition, the results of the thermodynamic study presented in Figure S6 and Table S6 show that:The value of Ea is in the
range of 16–40 kJ mol–1 suggests a physisorption
process.72

ΔG < 0 indicates the spontaneous
and favorable nature of the MB adsorption.73

The decrease of ΔG values implies
that higher temperature favors the MB adsorption.73,74

ΔH < 0 suggests
that the MB
adsorption is exothermic. The ΔH value was
less than 25 kJ·mol–1 indicates that MB adsorption
onto TDAW@alginate involves mainly van der Waals type forces and confirms
the physisorption nature of the adsorption.74,75

ΔS > 0 indicates
an increase
in the disorder degree of the adsorbed layer at the solid/solution
interface.



2.9 RSM-CCD:
Interactive Effects of Operational
Parameters and Numerical Optimization
The RSM coupled with
the CCD has been widely used for process optimization.76Table S7 summarizes
the CCD matrix and experimental results of MB removal on TDAW@alginate.
Based on Table S7, an empirical quadratic
regression equation was obtained as 2  

The adequacy of the regression model
(eq 2) and significance
of each coefficient was checked by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
the results obtained are depicted in Table S8. ANOVA analysis for the proposed model shows that all coefficients
were significant, whereas the quadrature effect of MB concentration
is insignificant (P-value = 0.747 > 0.05).77 The significance of the model was confirmed
by the P-value which is less than 0.05 with a high F-value.78 The high values of R2 (=0.989) indicate the qualitative agreement
between the predicted and experimental data obtained for the three
variables under MB adsorption onto TDAW@alginate. The value of Radj2 shows that 2.2% of the response
variation could not be explained by the model and that 97.8% of the
MB removal variation was because of the independent variables. To
evaluate the real system approximation of the model, normal probability
versus studentized residual was investigated (Figure S7). This plot shows a normal distribution of residuals
with a straight line, which confirms the normality of the model.76 The final model can be expressed using the following eq 3 3  

The response surface (3D) and the corresponding contour plots
(2D)
were applied to show the effects of various independent variables
influencing MB adsorption onto TDAW@alginate (Figure S8a,b). The plan of adsorbent dose–contact time
at an initial concentration constant was chosen to optimize the adsorption
process of MB onto TDAW@alginate. Indeed, a significant variation
in the MB removal was observed in this plan compared with the others
(adsorbent dose–MB concentration and MB concentration–contact
time). In Figure S8b, an increase in the
MB dye removal with the increasing adsorbent dose and contact time
can be clearly seen which can be explained by the fact that the increase
in the adsorbent dose facilitates more active sites for MB adsorption
onto the TDAW@alginate surface.76

The 3D presentation of the adsorbent dose–contact time plan
shows a croissant shape when the initial mass and the contact time
vary. The optimal contact time for significant MB removal was equal
to 45 min; at this value, the variation of the adsorbent dose from
6.34 to 23.66 mg was in favor of an increase in the MB removal by
+40%. Therefore, numerical optimization was preferred to search the
maximum MB removal using 3D and 2D presentations. 97.89 ± 2.62%
MB removal was chosen as an optimum obtained at 23.3 mg, contact time
of 45 min, an initial concentration of 9 mg/L, a temperature of 25
°C, and pH 10. To evaluate the value of the response (MB removal)
using the postulated model, triplicate verification was realized.
The experimental MB removal was found to be 98.12 ± 0.77%, demonstrating
the accuracy of the model for predicting dye removal.

2.10 Regeneration of the TDAW@alginate Adsorbent
The reusability
of the adsorbent was considered as a crucial economic
factor when assessing the cost-effectiveness of the treatment process.4,34 Additionally, the recovery ability of the adsorbent was a very important
index for industrial applicability. Generally, bead materials based
on alginate form hydrogels which are insoluble in solution and allow
the collection of the adsorbed dye quickly.79

In order to investigate the possibility of reusability of
MB from TDAW@alginate, a regeneration experiment was carried out under
optimum conditions found by the RSM using a solution with a pH of
2 and methanol. As shown in Figure S8c,
the adsorption performance of TDAW@Ag was gradually decreased with
the increasing regeneration cycles in both cases (with HCl or methanol).
The regeneration with methanol successfully eluted 74.15% of the MB
loaded onto TDAW@alginate after eight cycles of sorption–desorption.
On the other hand, 90.81% was observed when HCl was used. The results
reveal that TDAW@alginate shows high reusability efficiencies when
HCl was used compared with methanol. The higher desorption efficiency
at pH 2 is due to the excessive H+ ions, which replace
the adsorbed MB molecules through the ion exchange process.80 No difference was found in the retrieved mass
of TDAW@alginate after the six sorption–desorption cycles,
indicating the recovery ability of TDAW@alginate, thereby making the
dye-contaminated wastewater treatment more sustainable and economical.

2.11 Mechanism of MB Adsorption onto TDAW@alginate
The adsorption mechanism of MB dye onto TDAW@alginate was investigated
based on FTIR spectra before and after MB adsorption (Figure 9). As we have reported elsewhere,53 the FTIR spectrum of the TDAW adsorbent contains
many functional groups such as −OH, C=O, −C–O–,
and some oxides like Al–O and P–O. The analysis of the
FTIR spectrum of TDAW@alginate before MB adsorption shows the same
characteristic bands. Therefore, the main functional groups of alginate
are apparent at 3400, 1630, and 520 cm–1 attributed
to −OH stretching, the carboxyl group, and characteristic bands
of alginate, respectively.81 The sharp
peak at 1095 cm–1 indicates the presence of the
−C–O– stretching in the TDAW material. It is
noted that the wide band at 520 cm–1 absorbs all
characteristic bands of the oxide residual in the surface of TDAW,
which are apparent on the surface of TDAW in this region. In addition,
the FTIR spectrum of MB loaded TDAW@alginate shows that the peaks
of −C–O– and −OH are slightly shifted
from their original position by +67 and −80 cm–1, respectively. Moreover, the intensity of some bands such as C=O
and −C–O– has been increased after MB fixation
on the surface of TDAW@alginate. This confirms that these functional
groups are involved in the adsorption of MB onto TDAW@alginate by
electrostatic interaction. From these results, it can be concluded
that the mechanism is mainly referred to the electrostatic interaction,
pore sizes, and hydrogen bonding.

Figure 9 FTIR spectra of TDAW@alginate before and
after the MB adsorption.

The first observation of SEM images of TDAW@alginate before
and
after MB adsorption shows changes in the topography as well as in
the chemical contrast (Figure 10). These analyses allowed us to describe and explain
the adsorption process of MB molecules on our spherical carbon material.
Therefore, before the dye adsorption, the surface of TDAW@alginate
was very thin and compact (Figure 10a–c). However, after the dye adsorption, the
TDAW@alginate surface becomes rough and contains aggregates having
different chemical contrasts (Figures 9d and 10e,f). These changes
in the morphology confirm the adsorption of MB on the surface and
in the interior of TDAW@alginate particles.

prepared TDAW@alginate beads; (a–c)

3 Conclusions
This
work encompassed a systematic investigation on ACD and adsorption
processes leading to efficient depollution and management of agri-food
organic wastes. In the ACD process, BMP was successfully modified
by the variation of three independent variables such as the pH, inoculum,
and load, by using DOE-based CCD-RSM. Accordingly, higher microbial
activity was observed at pH 7.42 with an inoculum/load ratio equal
to 0.55 at 15 days of HRTs. In addition, the degradation of the OM
present in agri-food wastes during the ACD process was confirmed by
FTIR analysis, which showed the disappearance of polysaccharides and
polysaccharide substances present in the wastes. The present work
could be supplemented by examining the effect of waste mixing ratios
on the cumulative methane yield, providing, hence, valuable insight
into this topic.

Based on the modified digestion during the
ACD process, the core–shell
porous carbon material was prepared and showed higher MB molecule
removal capacity from water. Furthermore, the comparison of the experimental
adsorption data to the Langmuir model allowed the estimation of the
adsorbed maximum amount, which achieved 26.178 mg/g. In addition,
the adsorption process was found to be spontaneous and exothermic;
the core–shell particles have shown high reusability efficiencies
after eight cycles of sorption–desorption. These findings suggest
that the coupling of the ACD and the adsorption process seems to be
an efficient protocol for the following reasons:Large amount of methane, as a source of clean energy,
was generated.

Bio-digestate was converted
into porous carbon with
a very high surface area.

Core–shell
particles were prepared using a biopolymer
that is not toxic in water.

The problem
of liquid/solid phase separation during
adsorption processes was solved which reduces the filtration process
financial cost.

4.2 Substrates
and Inoculum for Co-Anaerobic Digestion
The substrates used
in this work to carry out ACD were collected
from the industry active in several fields ranging from agricultural
production to processing. These substrates represent the agri-food
organic wastes generated by this industry and whose management is
difficult. The agri-food organic wastes are of various types such
as PW, LDP, LBS, and PCS. To achieve ACD and a mixture composed by
these wastes, the proportions of preparation are presented in Table S1.

The inoculum, used to increase
microbial diversity and the effectiveness of degradation, was prepared
by a mixture of:(i) Primary treatment sludge from anaerobic
decantation of treatment plant wastewater constituting the normal
inoculum (INp).

(ii) Sludge diluted in a basic medium
specific to the methanogenic bacteria constituting the synthetic inoculum
(INS).82,83



The inoculum preparation method is presented in Table S1. The synthesized inoculum was stored for 15 days
at 38 °C to ensure the degradation of the OM.5 The details of physicochemical characteristics of the inoculum
and its contents are given in Table S1.

4.3 Batch Adsorption Study and Regeneration Experiments
In the present work, the TDAW@alginate was used as the adsorbent
to remove MB molecules from water, and the influence of five parameters
was tested. Thus, the effect of the TDAW@alginate dose was investigated
for a contact time of 160 min, a volume of the dye aqueous solution
of 40 mL, a dye concentration of 10 mg/L, and a natural pH. The effect
of pH on MB adsorption onto TDAW@alginate was investigated using 40
mL of MB (10 mg/L) for different pH values (3–12), at room
temperature. The effects of the contact time (from 0 to 120 mn) and
the initial dye concentration (from 5 to 40 mg/L) were evaluated by
using 25 mg of TDAW@alginate and 40 mL of the MB aqueous solution.
Finally, samples were withdrawn from the solution using a previously
cleaned spatula; then the residual MB concentrations were determined
by measuring the absorbance at λmax = 664 nm of the
supernatant. In order to investigate the adsorbent reusability, 25
mg of TDAW@alginate loaded with MB was washed thoroughly in 20 mL
of HCl (0.1 M) or methanol, and then the mixture was magnetically
stirred for 30 min. Eight cycles of adsorption–desorption studies
were carried out. Different equations used in this work to fit the
data are presented in Table S9.
