A practical
and efficient method has been developed for the dicarbonylation
of imidazoheterocycles using glyoxals as dicarbonyl precursors under
metal-free conditions in acetic acid. A series of symmetrical and
unsymmetrical dicarbonyl imidazoheterocycles was synthesized in good
yields. Aryl and alkyl glyoxals also demonstrated excellent reactivity
under similar reaction conditions and delivered corresponding dicarbonyl
imidazoheterocycles in high yields. It is believed that the glyoxal
plays a dual role both as a dicarbonyl source and as an oxidant in
this transformation. A probable mechanistic pathway has been proposed
based on control experiments and electrospray ionization high-resolution
mass spectrometry analysis.

Introduction
Dicarbonyl compounds
are valuable structural motifs present in
a variety of natural products and bioactive compounds that possess
a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities.1 For example, 1,2-bis-carbonyl compounds have been demonstrated
to be a potent, selective inhibitor of the human carboxylesterases
enzyme which is responsible for the detoxification of xenobiotics.1a,1e,2 Dicarbonyl compounds are also
used as powerful building blocks for the synthesis of N-heterocyclic
compounds such as imidazoles,3 quinoxalines,4 and triazines5 as
well as ligands6 such as N-heterocyclic
carbenes and diamines. 1,2-Dicarbonyls also possess exceptionally
useful synthetic potential as pronucleophiles7 and can be exploited in cascade or sequential reactions for the
synthesis of important hetero or carbocycles. Thus, the development
of newer synthetic methods for the dicarbonylation has always been
a fascinating topic in organic chemistry.8 In recent years, much attention has been paid towards oxidative
coupling reaction under metal-free conditions, which overcome the
drawbacks associated with metal catalyzed reactions. For example,
C-3 dicarbonylation of indoles have been achieved using arylglyoxal
via the aminocatalytic approach,9 acetophenones
in I2/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/pyrrolidine,10 aryl acetaldehydes in I2/DMSO employing
an assembled two-step continuous flow system.11 Recently, Pan and coworkers established a regioselective N-1 and
C-2 dicarbonylation of 3-substituted indoles with arylglyoxal hydrates.12 N-1 indolyl diketones were obtained in the presence
of copper acetate, while C-2 indolyl diketones were obtained under
metal-free reaction conditions.

On the other hand, the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
motif is a key structural unit found in numerous biologically active
molecules, particularly in many commercially available drugs such
as alpidem, zolpidem, necopidem, zolmidine, and saripidem.13 In the last decade, substantial efforts have
been devoted for the synthesis and functionalization of the imidazoheterocycles.14 A few successful and elegant methods have been
developed for the synthesis of unsymmetrical dicarbonylated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in the recent past using aryl acetaldehydes,15 aryl ketones,16 N,N-disubstituted
acetamide, or acetone,17 tertiary α-amino
phenylethanone,18 and arylglyoxals19 as the dicarbonyl source (Scheme 1). All these methods require the use of metal
catalysts (Cu and Fe), ligands, and an equimolar amount of external
halogenated oxidants and bases. Although some investigation towards
metal-free dicarbonylation of indoles9−12 has been conducted, metal-free
dicarbonylation of imidazoheterocycles are rare.20 In most of the developed protocols for dicarbonylation,
the emphasis has been on the synthesis of unsymmetrical dicarbonylated
compounds and synthesis of symmetrical dicarbonylated imidazoheterocycles
has remained unexplored. During the preparation of our manuscript,
Guo and coworkers reported a catalyst-free method for the synthesis
of dicarbonylation of imidazoheterocycles with glyoxal hydrates.21 In this method also only arylglyoxals were utilized
to synthesize unsymmetrical dicarbonylated imidazoheterocycles. Thus,
the development of metal-free dicarbonylation to obtain biologically
active symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicarbonyl imidazoheterocyles
under mild reaction conditions is still challenging and highly desirable.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Dicarbonyl Imidazoheterocyles
In continuation of our sustained
efforts towards synthesis and
functionalization of imidazoheterocycles,22 herein, we report a metal-free approach for the dicarbonylation
of imidazoheterocycles using glyoxals as dicarbonyl precursors in
acetic acid. It is believed that the glyoxal plays a dual role both
as a dicarbonyl source and as an oxidant in this transformation. A
probable mechanistic pathway has been proposed based on control experiments
and electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS)
analysis.

Results and Discussion
We started our studies by choosing
2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (1a)
and glyoxal (40 wt % aq solution; 2) as the model substrates.
The initial reaction was performed
with 1a (0.51 mmol) and 2 (2.55 mmol) using
AcOH (5 mL—160 equiv) as the solvent at 100 °C. To our
delight, the respective 1,2-bis(2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethane-1,2-dione (3a) was formed in a
69% yield in 8 h (Table 1, entry 1). Encouraged from this result under catalyst-free conditions,
we decided to optimize the reaction conditions for the model reaction
by varying different reaction parameters such as the amount of acetic
acid in the reaction mixture, amount of glyoxal, temperature, reaction
medium, and so forth. The results for the optimization reactions are
shown in Table 1. The
results indicated that the best yield of 3a was obtained
using acetic acid (3 mL), glyoxal (118 μL) at 100 °C (Table 1, entry 2). It was
observed that on decreasing the concentration of glyoxal, the yield
of 3a decreased from 70 to 38% (Table 1, entries 5–7). Similarly, the yield
of 3a decreased to 47% on decreasing the reaction temperature
to 50 °C and the desired product was not present at 25 °C
(Table 1, entry 8–10).
The use of PivOH instead of AcOH resulted in the formation of 3a in 52% yield (Table 1, entry 11). The use of aqueous medium such as water/AcOH,
water/TsOH/sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), and water/SLS resulted in
a diminished yield of 3a (Table 1, entry 12–14). The product 3a was not formed in the absence of acetic acid when the reaction
was performed in organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), xylene, and DMSO under standard
reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 15–17).

After having optimized reaction
conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 2), the utility of the
present approach was systematically investigated by reacting different
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines (1a–r) with glyoxal (2) (Table 2). Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
having electron donating groups (EDGs) viz. p-Me, p-OMe on the C-2 phenyl ring (1b and 1c) reacted smoothly with 2 and afforded respective
symmetrical dicarbonylated products 3b and 3c in 73 and 75% yields, respectively. Similarly, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) such
as p-F, p-Cl, p-Br, and p-CF3 on the C-2 phenyl ring
also reacted smoothly and gave the corresponding dimeric products 3d–g in good yields (60–67%). Although, the
substituent on the C-2 phenyl ring did not affect the reaction outcome
significantly, relatively better yields were observed in the case
of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with EDGs on the C-2 phenyl
ring. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine with C-2 thiophene-yl
(1h) also yielded the corresponding product 3h in 77% yield.

b Isolated yields.

In the case of 2-(tert-butyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (1i), the respective dimeric product
(3i) was not obtained under these conditions which may
be attributed to the steric factor of the tert-butyl
group. The reaction of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
with different substituents on the pyridine ring (1j–l) with 2 afforded the desired dimeric product in 3j–l in 61–70% yield. Interestingly, the reaction
of 6-methyl-2-(4-nitrophenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
(1m) with 2 also gave the desired product 3m in 58% yield. Finally, 2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines (1n–p) and 6-arylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles (1q–r) were allowed to react
with 2 under standard reaction conditions. To our delight,
the corresponding dimeric products (3n–p and 3q–r) were obtained in good yields (51–69%).
These experiments demonstrated that the scope of the reaction was
general for differently substituted imidazoheterocycles.

With
the success for the synthesis of symmetrical dicarbonyl imidazoheterocyles
under metal-free conditions, we next attempted the synthesis of unsymmetrical
dicarbonyl imidazoheterocyles using equimolar ratios of two different
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with glyoxal (2) under optimized reaction conditions. The cross-coupling reaction
of various substituents present on the C-2 aryl ring (p-OMe, p-Cl and p-NO2) and pyridine ring (6-Br and 7-Me) of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine were amenable to the reaction conditions and afforded the
respective unsymmetrical dicarbonyl products (3s, 3t, and 3u) in good yields (34–45%) as
compared to the corresponding symmetrical products (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Unsymmetrical
Dicarbonylated Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (3s–3u)
In order to check the versatility
of the present approach, we tested
different arylglyoxals as the carbonyl source with imidazoheterocycles
under similar reaction conditions to access unsymmetrical dicarbonyl
imidazoheterocycles (Table 3). The reaction of 1a with phenylglyoxal (4a) led to the formation of the desired product that is 1-phenyl-2-(2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethane-1,2-dione (5aa) in 82%
yield. Next, the reaction of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
having EDG viz. p-Me and EWGs such as p-Cl, p-Br, p-CF3, and m-NO2 on the C-2 phenyl ring were reacted with
phenylglyoxal (4a). The desired products that is 1-phenyl-2-(2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethane-1,2-diones (5ba–5ta) were obtained in good to high yields (70–90%). Similarly,
imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with substituents on the
pyridine ring as well as on the C-2 phenyl ring reacted smoothly with 4a to afford the corresponding dicarbonyl compounds (5ja, 5ma, 5ua, and 5va) in good to excellent yields (Table 3). 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine (1o) and 6-(4-methylphenyl)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole (1r) also reacted with 4a to give the corresponding dicarbonyl products 5oa and 5ra in 80 and 77% yields, respectively. Finally, the substrate
scope in terms of arylglyoxals was elaborated by reacting 1a with arylglyoxals (4b–f) bearing different functional
groups on the aryl ring. The desired 1-aryl-2-(2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethane-1,2-diones (5ab–af) were obtained in good to excellent yields (77–92%). No significant
electronic effect of substituents was observed on the yield of dicarbonyl
products. Heterocyclic glyoxal that is 2-oxo-2-(thiophen-2-yl)acetaldehyde
(4g) also reacted efficiently with 1a and
afforded the desired product 5ag in 93% yield. To our
delight, the reaction of 2-cyclohexyl-2-oxoacetaldehyde (4h) with 1a under similar reaction conditions afforded
the desired product 5ah in 91% yield. However, the reaction
of benzaldehyde with 1a under identical reaction conditions
failed to deliver the desired phenyl(2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)methanone (5ai) product.

yields.

It is worth mentioning
here that the reaction of 1-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-indole
(6a) and 1-methyl-1H-indole (6b) with glyoxal (2) under standard
reaction conditions did not give the corresponding symmetrical dicarbonyl
indole derivatives and instead resulted in the formation of the corresponding
2,2-bis(indol-3-yl)acetaldehydes (7a–b) in 63
and 65% yields, respectively (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Reaction of Indoles with Glyoxal
To check the practical utility of the present
approach, the gram-scale
reaction was performed using 1a (1.0 g; 5.1 mmol) with 2 (25.5 mmol, 40 wt % aq solution) and 4a (1.03
g, 7.6 mmol) under the standard reaction conditions. To our delight,
the desired products 3a and 5aa were formed
in 62 and 72% yields, respectively (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Gram Scale Synthesis of 3a and 5aa
Some control experiments were carried out to gain some
understanding
of the reaction mechanism of this metal-free dicarbonylation (Scheme 5). Initially, radical
trapping experiments were performed by using different radical scavengers
[such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (3 equiv), 1,1-diphenylethylene
(3 equiv), and 2,6-di-tertbutyl-4-methylphenol (3
equiv)] to shed light on the kind of mechanism involved for this transformation
(Scheme 5, eq i). In
all cases, no significant reduction in the yield of 3a was observed, thus the possibility of a radical-mediated reaction
was ruled out. Next, the reaction of 1a with 2 was performed under an inert atmosphere using identical reaction
conditions to justify the role of air as an oxidant for this reaction
(Scheme 5, eq ii).
However, to our surprise, we isolated the desired product 3a in 62% yield along with the isolation of another compound 8 in 18% yield (Scheme 5, eq iii). We established the molecular structure of 8 as 2-oxo-2-(2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethyl
acetate. When 8 was allowed to react with 1a under standard reaction conditions without using glyoxal, 3a was formed in less than 10% after 8 h. This indicated that 8 is not the intermediate of this transformation but it is
a side product. The formation of traces of 3a from 8 may be due to the aerobic oxidation of de-acetylated intermediate 12 (produced from 8) followed by nucleophilic
addition of 1a. We also checked the reaction of 1a with 4a under an inert atmosphere (Scheme 5, eq iv). The desired
product 5aa was obtained in 65% yield indicating that
air is not a prominent oxidant in this transformation. Key intermediates
were traced by performing ESI-HRMS analysis of the model reaction
(Scheme 5, eq v). Based
on formation of 8 and other related side products in
the reaction mixture as well as significant yield of dicarbonyl products
under a nitrogen atmosphere made us believe that glyoxal also acts
as the oxidant in this transformation. The benzoin derivative obtained
by nucleophilic addition of imidazoheterocycle to glyoxal is oxidized
to the dicarbonyl derivative (benzil) by glyoxal through hydrogen
transfer. Arylglyoxals has been reported to oxidize thiols to the
corresponding disulfides,23 however, to
the best of our knowledge this is the first finding where glyoxal
has been found to oxidize benzoins. At this stage, we cannot rule
out the possibility of simultaneous aerobic oxidation of the benzoins
to the corresponding dicarbonyl derivatives.

Scheme 5 Control Experiments
On the basis of preliminary
mechanistic studies and relevant literature
reports,12,21,23 a plausible
mechanism is proposed for the formation of 3a (Scheme 6). We believe initially
acetic acid mediated nucleophilic addition of 1a to 2 leads to the formation of α-hydroxy aldehyde (benzoin) 9 through intermediate A. Formation of 9 was confirmed by ESI-HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture
(Scheme 5, eq v). Intermediate 9 then underwent glyoxal mediated oxidation or aerial oxidation
to the corresponding keto aldehyde intermediate 13. The
formation of product 3a under a nitrogen atmosphere and
decline yield of 3a with reducing the amount of glyoxal
indicates the involvement of glyoxal as the oxidant in this reaction.
This hypothesis was further supported by the formation of intermediate 11 observed in the ESI-HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture
(Scheme 5, eq v). The
intermediate 13 underwent nucleophilic addition with
another molecule of 1a followed by deprotonation to produce
the intermediate 10 which upon oxidation provided the
desired product 3a.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a metal-free method has been developed for the synthesis
of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicarbonyl imidazoheterocycles using
glyoxals as the carbonyl source. The present method demonstrated practical
and green reaction conditions to afford unexplored symmetrical dicarbonyl
imidazoheterocycles in good yields. More importantly, unsymmetrical
dicarbonyl imidazoheterocycles were also obtained in high yields as
compared to the previously reported methodologies under metal-free
conditions. The method is amenable for a scale-up reaction which has
been demonstrated through the gram scale reaction. Mechanistic investigation
revealed that glyoxal has a dual role in this transformation both
as a dicarbonyl source as well as an oxidant.

Melting points were determined
in open capillary tubes on an EZ-Melt automated melting point apparatus
and are uncorrected. All the compounds were unambiguously characterized
by 1H, 13C, and IR and further confirmed through
ESI-HRMS analysis. The reactions were monitored by using thin layer
chromatography (TLC) on 0.2 mm silica gel F254 plates (Merck). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance 400 and 100 MHz instrument, respectively in CDCl3 as a solvent using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.
Peak multiplicities of 1H NMR signals were designated as
s (singlet), br s (broad singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), and so forth. Chemical shifts
(δ) and coupling constants (J) are reported
in parts per million (ppm) relative to the residual signal of TMS
in deuterated solvents and hertz, respectively. ESI-HRMS were recorded
using Agilent Technologies 6545 Q-TOF LC/MS. IR spectra were recorded
using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer, and
the values are reported in cm–1. Column chromatography
was performed over silica gel (60–120 and 100–200 mesh)
using EtOAc–n-hexane as an eluent. All chemicals
were obtained from the commercial suppliers and used without further
purification. All the imidazoheterocycles were prepared by our reported
methods.

General Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis of Symmetrical
Dicarbonyl Imidazoheterocycles (3a–3r)
A clean oven dried 25 mL round bottom flask was charged with 1 (0.51 mmol) and 2 (2.55 mmol; 40 wt % aq solution)
in acetic acid (3 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C
for 8 h. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After completion,
the reaction mass was allowed to cool at ambient temperature. Acetic
acid was neutralized by saturated solution of NaHCO3 (30
mL) and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic
layer was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated
under reduced pressure. The residue was purified in silica gel (60–120
mesh) column chromatography using EtOAc–n-hexane
as the eluent to afford the corresponding products (3a–3r) in moderate to good yields (51–77%).

General Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis of Unsymmetrical
Dicarbonyl Imidazoheterocycles with Glyoxal (3s–3u)
A clean oven dried 25 mL round bottom flask was charged
with equimolar ratios of two different imidazoheterocycles (0.51 mmol)
and 2 (2.55 mmol; 40 wt % aq solution) in acetic acid
(3 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 8 h. The
reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After completion, the reaction
mass was allowed to cool at ambient temperature. Acetic acid was neutralized
by saturated solution of NaHCO3 (30 mL) and extracted with
EtOAc (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic layer was dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced
pressure. The residue was purified in silica gel (100–200 mesh)
column chromatography using EtOAc–n-hexane
as the eluent to afford the corresponding products (3s–3u) in 34–45% yields.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 2,2-Bis(indolyl)acetaldehydes
(7a–b)
A clean oven dried 25 mL round
bottom flask was charged with 6 (0.51 mmol) and glyoxal
(2.55 mmol; 40 wt % aq solution) in acetic acid (3 mL). The reaction
mixture was heated with stirring at 80 °C for 30 min. The reaction
progress was monitored by TLC. After completion, the reaction mass
was allowed to cool at ambient temperature. Acetic acid was neutralized
by saturated solution of NaHCO3 (30 mL) and extracted with
EtOAc (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic layer was dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced
pressure. The residue was purified in silica gel (60–120 mesh)
column chromatography using EtOAc–n-hexane
as the eluent to afford the corresponding products (7a–b) in good yields (63–65%).
