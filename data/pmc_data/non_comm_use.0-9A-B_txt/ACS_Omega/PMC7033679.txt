A fascinating way to originate a
mechanically stable metallogel
of ferric ions with metal-coordinating organic ligand triethylenetetramine
through direct mixing of their water solutions in a stoichiometric
ratio is achieved under ambient conditions. The rheological study
established the mechanical property of the Fe(III) metallogel. A cashew-shaped

Introduction
Over past decades,
through the development of new functional materials
and their imminent applications in a wide range of science and commercial
industries,1,2 gels earn a strong position in scientific
research. Gels are semisolid 3D scaffolds where the solvents are immobilized
by the gelator networks.1,3 The semisolid-like architecture
is the outcome of self-assembly phenomena between small molecules
in different solvents directing the gelation process.1 Low-molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) produce 3D gel structures
that trap the solvent, and from this, we derive the semisolid viscoelastic
material noted as the supramolecular gel.4 Several supramolecular interactions including hydrogen bonding,5 hydrophobic interactions,6−9 metal coordination,10−13 electrostatic interactions,14−16 aromatic π-ring-mediated
interactions,6−9 van der Waals forces,5 and π-system-based
stacking17,18 are key factors for developing functional
supramolecular gels. Hydrogels have potential applications in science
and cost-effective industries ranging from chemistry to physics and
biology to pharmacy including cellular encapsulation,19 tissue engineering,20 and material
science covering oil recovery,21 sensors,22 electro-optics/photonics,23 cosmetics,24 structure-directing
agents,25 catalysis,26 drug delivery,27 therapeutic
delivery,28 electrochemical applications,29 photolithography,30 biomedical applications,31 power source,32 electronic devices,33 etc. Among these types of gel materials, metallogels belong to an
important class describing the assembly of metal ions and organic
ligands via metal–ligand interactions to obtain a stable gel
network.34 Due to their diverse applications,
the metallogel has become an interesting aspect in conduction,35 proton conductivity,34,36 magnetism,37 redox,38 catalytic properties,39−41 sensing,42,43 etc.

The metallogelation process is manifested by different
approaches
including coordination polymeric networks,44−46 metal coordination
complexes,7 organometallics,47 cross-linked coordination polymers,48 and metal–ligand interaction-based gelation.49 Transition-metal ions like Co2+,50−52 Ni2+,49,50 Cu2+,49,53 Cd2+,54,55 Fe2+/3+,38,36,56−59 and Zn2+53,60 are used for metallogelation with multiple extraordinary applications
in science and technology.61 The Fe(III)
metallogel has been gaining special attention due to its diverse uses
in magnetism,38 semiconducting properties,57 self-healing ability,36 etc.

During the last few years, our group has been involved
in metallogel-based
research on fabrication of semiconducting devices.57 Besides, we have an aim to approach the multi-functional
behavior of the metallogel system.62 Powered
with the knowledge of transition-metal ion-directed catalysis toward
synthetic organic chemistry,63 Fe(III)-metallogel-based
catalysis in organic synthesis has been targeted. Through this present
endeavor, we have successfully shown the multifunctional applications
of the metallogel system.

Here, we have introduced a triethylenetetramine
(TETA)-based metallogel
of Fe(III) (Fe@TETA). Fe@TETA shows the semiconducting application
of a Schottky barrier diode device. Interestingly, Fe@TETA exhibits
an excellent catalytic role for the synthesis of thioethers via a
C–S coupling reaction. Though the transition-metal-catalyzed
aryl–S cross-coupling reactions are well established,64−66 the development of a mostly cost-effective catalytic method for
the aryl–S coupling reaction is still a challenging task due
to the enormous applications of C–S coupled products in the
pharmaceutical industry and biological aspects. The synthesized Fe@TETA
metallogel-based catalysis for the synthesis of aryl thioethers is
a comparatively64−66 more industrial and environmentally friendly faster
pathway that does not need to use any supporting ligand/additive and
any organic solvent. This is one of the significant studies to establish
the metallogel-based Schottky barrier diode device along with the
metallogel-catalyzed, solvent-free aryl–S cross-coupling reactions
to get aryl thioethers by a structurally flexible multifunctional
soft metallogel system. In this current work, the instantaneous gel
formation of Fe(III) with triethylenetetramine (TETA) in water is
described (Figure 1).

vial test photograph of Fe@TETA.

The critical gelation concentration was found to be 404 mg mL–1. To determine the minimum critical gel concentration
(MGC) of the Fe@TETA metallogel, the concentration of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was varied from 1 to 404 mg mL–1, and effectively, the nonflowing gel was observed
only at a minimum concentration of 404 mg mL–1,
which was determined to be the critical gelation concentration (Figure 2). The gel to sol
temperature (Tgel) of the Fe@TETA metallogel
was found to be moderately excellent, and it was recorded at 130 °C.
(See the Supporting Information for the gelation process of the Fe@TETA
metallogel with a Fe(NO3)3·9H2O salt in various solvents, Table S1.)

critical gelation concentration (MGC) (404 mg mL–1).

Results and Discussion
Rheological Analysis
The rheological measurements confirm
the viscoelastic semisolid nature of the Fe@TETA hydrogel (Figure 3). The storage modulus
(G′) represents the amount of energy stored
in the system during the application of shear on the viscoelastic
region. The loss modulus (G″) represents the
amount of energy dissipated under the application of oscillatory stress.
For the gel state, the storage modulus (G′)
is considerably higher than the loss modulus (G″).

Figure 3 Angular
frequency-dependent storage modulus (G′) and
loss modulus (G″) of the Fe@TETA
metallogel.

The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus
(G″) of the samples are expressed as 1   2  (Here, σ0 is the shear stress amplitude, γ0 is the strain
amplitude, σ0/γ0 is the amplitude
ratio, and δ is the phase angle.)

Rheological results
support that the G′
of the Fe@TETA metallogel is significantly higher than G″ (i.e., G′ > 104) at
a
certain gel concentration (Figure 3). The observed rheological data (i.e., G′ ≫ G″) establishes the stability
of the gel structural property of the Fe@TETA hydrogel as well as
the solid-like behavior. The oscillatory stress measurements of the
Fe@TETA metallogel were also obtained (Figure 4). The value was constant over an oscillatory
stress range of 100–102 rad/s.

Figure 4 Oscillatory
stress measurements of the Fe@TETA metallogel.

The strain sweep measurements of the Fe@TETA metallogel performed
at a constant frequency of 1 rad/s. Here, Fe(III) acts as cross-linker
and strengthening agent into the gel network. The metal probably increases
the additional stability to the metallogel.

Microstructural and Infrared
Spectral Study
The microstructural
feature of the Fe@TETA metallogel was scrutinized by FESEM structural
analysis. The morphology of Fe@TETA showed the agglomerated cashew-like
structure of the metallogel (Figure 5a,b). The structural patterns of the metallogel, observed
in FESEM, were generated through immediate mixing of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and TETA ligands in a water medium.
The elemental mapping (Figure 5c–g) evidences C, N, O, and Fe elements present in
the gel network (see the Supporting Information for detailed FESEM
images and EDX spectra, Figures S1 and S2). The detailed infrared spectral study of the Fe@TETA metallogel
and pure triethylenetetramine is given in the Supporting Information
(Figure S3).

elements present in the gel.

Device Fabrication
Here, in this report, we have fabricated
multiple metal–semiconductor (MS) junction devices to perform
an electrical study. The devices were fabricated as sandwich-like
structures in the form of ITO/Fe@TETA/Al. In this regard, on top of
the precleaned ITO-coated glass substrate, the thin film of our synthesized
metallogel (Fe@TETA) was deposited by a doctor-blade method. To evaporate
the solvent part completely, the as-deposited thin film was dried
in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for several minutes subsequently. Using
a surface profiler, the thicknesses of the developed thin films were
measured as ∼1 μm. The aluminum was deposited as a metal
electrode in the vacuum coating unit of HINDHIVAC (model no: 12A4D)
under a pressure of 10–6 Torr. Using a shadow mask,
the effective area of the device was maintained as 7.065 × 10–6 m2.

Employing a two-probe technique,
the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics
of the devices were recorded with the help of a source meter made
by Keithley (model no: 2635B). All the measurements and study were
carried out under a N2-filled glovebox and laboratory temperature
of 26 °C.

Optical Characterization
UV–vis
analysis was
performed here to analyze the optical characterization of the synthesized
Fe@TETA metallogel. The solid-state absorbance spectra of the Fe@TETA
metallogel (inset, Figure 6) were recorded by preparing the thin films of well dispersed
complexes in DMF in the range of 200–600 nm. The direct optical
band gap was estimated using Tauc’s equation (eq 3).67 3  where α, Eg, h, and ν stand for
the absorption
coefficient, band gap, Planck’s constant, and frequency of
light, respectively. The exponent “n”
is the electron transition process-dependent constant. “A” is a constant, which is considered as 1 for an
ideal case. Considering n = 1/2,67 the direct optical band gap of the Fe@TETA metallogel was
calculated from the extrapolation of the linear region of the plot
(αhν)2 versus hν (Figure 6)
to an α = 0 absorption as 2.84 eV.

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption
spectra (inset) and Tauc’s plot
of the Fe@TETA metallogel.

Electrical Characterization
The obtained optical band
gap of the Fe@TETA metallogel suggests it as a semiconductor material.
Hence, we have fabricated a metal (Al)–semiconductor (Fe@TETA)
(MS) junction thin-film device and studied its electrical parameters
by analyzing the charge transport behavior.

The I–V characteristic of our complex-based devices
was recorded at a corresponding applied bias voltage sequentially
within the limit of ±2 V and is presented in Figure 7. The electrical conductivity
of our complex-based device was estimated as 1.003 × 10–4 S m–1, typical of a semiconductor. Moreover, the
representative I–V characteristic
of the Al/Fe@TETA interface (Figure 7) represents a nonlinear rectifying behavior, similar
to that of the Schottky barrier diode (SBD). The rectification ratio
(Ion/Ioff)
of our fabricated SBD at ±2 V was obtained as 21.04.

Figure 7 I–V characteristic curve
for ITO/Fe@TETA/Al-structured thin-film devices.

Using thermionic emission theory, the I–V characteristic of the Fe@TETA-based SBDs was analyzed.
To extract important diode parameters, here, we have employed Cheung’s
method.67,69 The obtained I–V curve
was quantitatively analyzed by considering the following standard
equations:67,68 4   5  where I0, k, T, V, A, η, and A* stand for
the saturation current, electronic charge, Boltzmann constant, temperature
in Kelvin, forward bias voltage, effective diode area, ideality factor,
and effective Richardson constant, respectively. The effective Richardson
constant for our fabricated Fe@TETA metallogel-based devices was considered
as 32 AK–2 cm–2.

The ideality
factor, barrier potential height, and series resistance
of our devices were also determined by using eqs 6–8, which were extracted from Cheung’s work69,70 6   7   8  

From the intercept
and slope of the dV/d ln I versus I plot (Figure 8), the ideality factor (η) and the
series resistance (RS) for our fabricated
device were determined. For our fabricated SBD, the value of the ideality
factor (η) was estimated as 1.39, which depicts a deviation
from the ideal value (∼1). The existence of interface states
and series resistance at the junction and the presence of inhomogeneities
of the Schottky barrier height may be the main reason of this deviation.71,72 As the value of the ideality factor of our synthesized complex-based
device is more or less near the ideal value (∼1), it depicts
the fewer number of recombination of interfacial charge carriers and
generation of better homogeneity at the barrier of Schottky junctions.67 From this, it may be concluded that our synthesized
complex-based SBD possesses less carrier recombination at the junction,
that is, better barrier homogeneity.

Figure 8 dV/d ln I vs I and H vs I curves for the synthesized
Fe@TETA-based thin-film device.

Using the just calculated ideality factor (η), the value
of the barrier height (ØB) was determined from the intercept of the H(I) versus I plot (Figure 8) [eq 10]. The series resistance (RS)
of the device can also be determined from the slope of this plot.
The measured ideality factor (η), potential height (ϕB), and series resistance (RS)
for our devices are listed in Table 1. The series resistance obtained from both processes
shows good consistency.

For a better understanding of the
charge transport phenomena at
the MS junction, it requires an analysis of the I–V curves in detail. The characteristic I–V curve
in the logarithmic scale reveals that it can be differentiated into
two slopes (Figure 9), which have been marked as regions I and II.

Figure 9 log I vs log V curves for the
Fe@TETA-based thin-film device.

In region I, the current follows the relation I ∝ V and the value of the slope is ∼1.
This region is referred to as the ohmic regime. In region II, the
current is proportional to V2 (Figure 9). Here, the value
of the slope is approximately 2. This is the characteristic of a trap-free
space charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.67,73 In this region, the injected carriers are more than the background
carriers. Therefore, the injected carriers spread and generate a space
charge field. Hence, in this region, the currents are controlled by
this space charge field and are known as SCLC.67,73 Therefore, we have adopted the SCLC theory to calculate the device
performance of this region.

Using the Mott-Gurney equation,
the effective carrier mobility
has been estimated by following the SCLC model from a higher voltage
region of the I versus V2 plot (Figure 10)67,70,73 9  where I,
ε0, εr, and μeff present the current, permittivity of free space, relative dielectric
constant of the synthesized material, and effective dielectric constant,
respectively.

Figure 10 I vs V2 curves
for
the Fe@TETA-based thin-film device.

To measure the relative dielectric constant, we have drawn the
capacitance against the frequency of the synthesized material in a
film format at a constant bias potential (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Capacitance vs frequency graph for determination
of the dielectric
constant.

The dielectric permittivity
of the complex was calculated from
the saturated values of capacitance at the higher frequency regime
(Figure 11) using
the following equation:67 10  where C, D, and A refer to the capacitance (at saturation),
thickness of the film that has been considered as ∼1 μm,
and effective area, respectively. Using the above formula, the relative
dielectric constant of our synthesized material was estimated as 2.06
× 10–1. To analyze charge transport across
the junction, a few more key parameters such as the transit time (τ)
and diffusion length (LD) were also estimated.
Using the slope of the SCLC region (region II) in a logarithmic representation
of the forward I–V curve
(Figure 9), τ
was evaluated from eq 11(67) 11   12   13  where D is
the diffusion coefficient determined using the Einstein–Smoluchowski
equation (eq 12).67 When a metal semiconductor junction is formed,
the diffusion length (LD) of charge carriers
plays an influential role in device performance and is further extracted
from eq 13. All the
parameters estimated in the SCLC region are listed below in Table 2. The higher mobility
implies a higher transport rate; also, it depicts the generation of
a higher number of charge carriers. The diffusion length reveals the
path length of the charge carriers before being recombined. The diode
parameters of our synthesized complex-based SBD demonstrate that these
kinds of materials can pave the way for a very promising future in
device application.

Fe@TETA-Catalyzed Formation of Aryl Thioethers
Fe@TETA
acts as an economically viable catalyst toward the aryl–S coupling
reaction. Thiophenol along with its derivative and different aryl
halides is used to explore the possibility of Fe@TETA as a catalyst
toward C–S cross-coupling reactions under solvent-free conditions.
Initially, bromobenzene and thiophenol reacted in a Fe@TETA metallogel
with zinc dust for 12 h in an open single-reaction vessel while maintaining
the temperature at 80 °C. Diphenylsulfane as the coupled product
(Table 4, entry 1)
was synthesized with an 88% yield maintaining the optimized reaction
strategy. To explore the catalytic role of Fe@TETA in versatile C–S
coupling reactions, different aromatic halides including 4-bromobenzonitrile,
1-iodo-4-methoxybenzene, 2-bromopyridine, and 9-bromophenanthrene
(Table 4, entries 2–5)
are reacted, and Fe@TETA efficiently catalyzed the C–S coupling
reactions to isolate aryl sulfanes (Table 2) such as 4-(phenylthio)benzonitrile (entry
2, yield 89%), (4-methoxyphenyl)(phenyl)sulfane (entry 3, yield 87%),
2-(phenylthio)pyridine (entry 4, yield 88%), and benzene-1,2,4-triyltris(phenylsulfane)
(entry 5, yield 90%) through an optimized reaction condition of using
a single-pot reaction at 80 °C under open aerial conditions.
Following a similar methodology, Fe@TETA also acts as the catalyst
for the C–S coupling reactions of aryl halides with the versatile
derivatives of thiophenols (Table 5, entries 1–5).

When 4-methoxybenzenethiol reacts with 1-iodo-4-methylbenzene,
4-bromobenzonitrile and 1-chloro-4-iodobenzene also offer aryl thioethers,
that is, (4-methoxyphenyl)(p-tolyl)sulfane (Table 5, entry 1, yield 88%),
4-(4-methoxyphenylthio)benzonitrile (Table 5, entry 2, yield 84%), and (4-chlorophenyl)(4-methoxyphenyl)sulfane
(Table 5, entry 3,
yield 87%) by using the Fe@TETA catalyst (10 mol %). Likewise, thiophenol
derivatives involving 4-methylbenzenethiol and 4-chlorobenzenethiol
are employed to judge the catalytic efficiency of Fe@TETA for the
formation of aryl thioethers with 4-bromobenzonitrile to produce 4-(p-tolylthio)benzonitrile (Table 5, entry 4, yield 89%) and 4-(4-chlorophenylthio)benzonitrile
(Table 5, entry 5, yield 85%), respectively, as aryl sulfides following
the optimized reaction condition.

Previously, Bolm et al. reported65 a
critical reaction process for iron-catalyzed C–S coupling reactions,
which needs a high temperature of 135 °C and long reaction time
of 24 h with organic solvent toluene and supporting ligands (Scheme 1). Anilkumar and
co-workers also reported66 the iron-catalyzed
C–S coupling reaction in the presence of supporting ligands
and external base at a temperature of 130 °C for a 24 h reaction
time (Scheme 1). In
comparison, our method of the Fe@TETA-metallogel catalyzed C–S
coupling reaction for the synthesis of aryl thioethers is really noteworthy
as neither it needs to use any supporting ligands/additives nor it
requires any solvent to perform the reaction. Moreover, the presence
of the Fe@TETA metallogel catalyst is able to complete the coupling
reaction within 12 h at a comparatively65,66 lower temperature
(80 °C). Thus, the Fe@TETA metallogel-based catalytic method
offers a solvent-free synthetic strategy of aryl thioethers through
a C–S coupling reaction.

Reusability of the Fe@TETA
Catalyst
The Fe@TETA metallogel
was examined to estimate its recycling abilities (entry 1 of Table 4). After the completion
of each Fe@TETA-catalyzed reaction on entry 1 of Table 4, Fe@TETA was collected by filtration
and a subsequent drying process.

The Fe@TETA metallogel was
then reused further to produce thioether up to four cycles. After
the first run, 98% catalyst was recovered, whereas the recovery rate
gradually lowers from the second, third, to fourth runs (Scheme 2).

Conclusions
In
summary, a triethylenetetramine (TETA)-directed iron(III) metallogel
was synthesized by instantaneous mixing of TETA and Fe(III) salt in
water at ambient conditions. FESEM microstructural analyses of the
Fe@TETA metallogel explored the cashew-shaped architecture of the
metallogel. The rheological investigations of the Fe@TETA metallogel
show that the metallogel material is mechanically stable. The electrical
experiment (i.e., I–V characteristics)
explores the usefulness of the Fe@TETA metallogel as a Schottky barrier
diode device. Remarkably, the I–V characteristics
of the Fe@TETA-mediated SBD exhibit a considerable rectification ratio.
The diode parameters of Fe@TETA are also calculated, and they depict
the formation of a Fe@TETA-based electronic device to act as a Schottky
barrier diode. Here, we have also explored the Fe(III)-metallogel-catalyzed
C–S coupling reaction of aryl halides with aromatic thiols
to synthesize aryl thioethers following an optimized reaction protocol.
This C–S coupling reaction highlights the effective use of
the Fe(III) metallogel as an economically viable catalyst for the
aryl–S coupling reaction.

solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.404
g, 1 mM) and 500 μL of pure triethylenetetramine (TETA) under
ambient conditions. The image of the insertion vial test of the Fe@TETA
given in Figure 1 shows

General Experimental
Procedure for the Synthesis of Diphenylsulfide
(Entry 1, Table 4)
The mixture of thiol (0.50 mmol), bromobenzene (0.50 mmol), zinc
(0.750 mmol), and the Fe@TETA metallogel (10 mol %) was taken in a
reaction vessel (tube) and stirred with a magnetic stir bar, and the
mixture was allowed to stir for 12 h at ∼80 °C. The movement
of the reaction was examined by TLC. The reaction mixture was extracted
by chloroform (25 mL) after completion of each reaction. The Fe@TETA
metallogel was washed with deionized water due to its compatibility
with the aqueous solvent, and the catalyst was filtered from the reaction
mixture. The Fe@TETA metallogel catalyst was allowed to dry for reuse.
The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the concentrated pure coupling product diphenylsulfane was
obtained through column chromatography with an 88% yield (Table 4, entry 1).
