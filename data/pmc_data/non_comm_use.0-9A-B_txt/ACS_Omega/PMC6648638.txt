White
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been achieved using photopolymerization.
Red and green CdSe/ZnS core–shell quantum dots (QDs) are dispersed
in photopolymerized aliphatic acrylic acrylate resins, cured by using
36 W UV light for 1.5 min producing QD–acrylate nanocomposites,
and then a hybrid LED device is achieved using the QD–acrylate
nanocomposite with two emission wavelengths excited by using a blue
InGaN LED chip. The cured QD–acrylate nanocomposite films are
characterized by using ultraviolet–visible, fluorescence, scanning
electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and thermogravimetric
analysis measurements. Photopolymerization is conveniently employed
to adjust several parameters of the CIE-1931 coordinate (x, y), color temperature, and color rending index
(CRI). Good white balance of the red-green hybrid device achieves
a luminance of 7976 lm/m2 at a 30 mA working current. The
light emission efficiency, CRI, and color temperature of 14%, 47,
and 11 204 K, respectively, are attained at this working current.

Introduction
Efficient
white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have attracted considerable
attention in solid-state illumination recently. Several methods are
developed to fabricate white light LEDs, the phosphor-converted emission
is the most commonly used technique.1 Up
to now, various materials such as inorganic phosphors,1 organic dyes,2 and quantum dots
(QDs)3 have been employed to test the possibility
to replace the common phosphors in white LEDs. In these materials,
QD is an innovative material because it has advantages over the commonly
used phosphors. The emission wavelength adjustment of the QDs is generally
completed by controlling the size of the crystal or varying the chemical
composition. In addition, the scattering effects of QDs are rarely
observed because the size of QD particles is relatively small compared
to inorganic phosphors. Compared to organic dyes, QDs are not easily
bleached, demonstrating a longer lifetime and a wider absorption range.
A QD-based white LED is generally fabricated using a spin-coating
technique, in which QDs are mixed with epoxy resins and are then coated
on the excited chips.3 However, an alternative
photoactive packaging (PAP) method has also been used to fabricate
the white LEDs.4 In the PAP method, a bare
blue LED chip was covered with a red and green QD-dispersed photosensitive
resin film to make the white LED illuminate when the current is passed
through the blue LED chip. This packaging method eliminates the additional
facilities that are used to package LEDs in the present process. Here,
the white balance of this hybrid LED was achieved by mixing red and
green QDs in the photosensitive resins.

Quantum dots possess
some characteristics such as a size-tunable
energy bandgap, high quantum efficiency of photoluminescence (PL),
solution processing, and adjustable absorption and emission wavelength.5 QDs have been widely used in photoelectronic
devices of solar cells6−8 and light-emitting diodes.9 Encapsulation of quantum dots (QDs) into polymers can improve the
photoluminescence stability and device performance of optoelectronic
and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).10,11 In the fabrication
of LEDs, the dispersion and quantum efficiency of QDs in the polymer
matrix are the most important factors. The optical properties of QDs
are affected by several factors, such as the QD size, the type of
ligand molecule, and the type of matrix. The structure and interaction
of organic compounds on the surface of the QD affect the fluorescence
of the QD. Green’s group12 has reviewed
the properties of capped ligands such as trioctylphosphine oxide,
amines, carboxylic acids, or thiols on the surface of the QDs. The
defects on the surface of the QDs can work as the hole of electrons
or holes. Therefore, surface passivation of quantum dots can reduce
their recombination leading to the enhancement of fluorescence. A
common method of surface passivation of CdSe-QDs is made using a thin
shell of a wider bandgap material such as ZnS for surface protection,13 thereby forming a core–shell structure.14 The shell forms a more passivated surface, resulting
in the reduction in nonradiative pathways with an effective increase
in quantum efficiency. One-step synthesis has been employed to prepare
CdSe/ZnS quantum dots.4 The one-step synthesis
method is much faster than the two-step in the manufacturing process,
which is in favor of mass production in the future. Because the quantum
confinement effect and the core–shell structure existed in
the QDs having few defects on the crystal surface, the light-emitting
efficiency of photoexcitation is extremely high. Another approach
uses a dangling bond formed by a suitable surface passivation ligand
to reduce surface traps.15 There are two
challenges in the incorporation of QDs into the polymer matrix, that
is, QD aggregation and fluorescence quenching. QDs can be incorporated
into the polymeric matrix by a number of methods, including the in
situ synthesis of QDs in the polymer,16 the direct incorporation of QDs into the polymer,17 and the in situ polymerization of monomer-containing QDs
forming a cured resin hybrid.18,19 The structure and molecular
polarity of the polymer matrix have obvious interactions with the
capping ligands on the surface of QDs. It needs to select the molecular
structure and molecular polarity to be completely miscible with the
prepared quantum dots, forming a uniformly transparent precursor solution.
After curing, the coating of the precursor solution generates a hybrid
film of the light-emitting diode with good light transmittance. Recently,
the incorporation of phosphine ligand-coupled CdSe and CdSe/ZnS QDs
into poly(methyl methacrylate) demonstrated no phase separation during
polymerization.20 Without modification
of the surface of the QDs, a stable and bright green photoluminescent
CdSe/poly(butyl acrylate) nanocomposite was obtained by in-situ miniemulsion
polymerization.21 Wang et al. dispersed
CdSe/ZnS QDs in photosensitive epoxy resin to produce a white LED
by means of an active packaging method.4 On the other hand, the incorporation of CdSe/ZnS QDs into poly(2-methoxy-5(2-ethylhexyloxy))
to produce organic LEDs can significantly improve the performance
of this hybrid device.22 Organic silicone
resins have good transparency, flexibility, stress relief, thermal
stability, moisture resistance, and high gas permeability, which have
been widely used in packaging CdSe/ZnS QD LEDs.11,23 The quantum dots are directly dispersed in the organic resin and
mounted on the surface of the semiconductor chip to emit white light.24 The CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs are encapsulated
in the polymer matrix of cyanoacrylate and epoxy resin, resulting
in the loss or increase of QD light emission in these polymers.10 The QD light-emitting film was commonly prepared
by adding the solution of quantum dots into the polymer, coating on
the substrate, and then heating to remove the solvent. This process
often takes much time to perform the polymerization/curing reaction
at relatively high temperatures (∼120–150 °C),
leading to a decline in QDs. Alternatively, in 2008, an epoxy acrylate
monomer using photopolymerization has been employed to make QD light-emitting
films achieve a white LED.25 This epoxy
resin system having benzene rings in the polymer chains would result
in the yellowing phenomenon by extending the use time, leading to
a decline of the light-emitting efficiency.25

Because the photopolymerization of the acrylic system is easier
to control compared to the epoxy system, we employed the photopolymerization
process using an aliphatic acrylic acrylate oligomer and an acrylic
monomer to prepare red and green QDs involving the aliphatic polymer
film in this study, avoiding yellowing of the polymer matrix. In this
work, we directly dispersed tri-n-octylphosphine
(TOP)-capped CdSe/ZnS QDs into an acrylic acrylate oligomer using
the solution mixing method, followed by solvent removal, and then
coating this mixture on a blue LED chip and curing by UV light to
achieve a QD–acrylate hybrid LED device. In addition, we report
the optical, morphological, topological, and thermal properties of
UV-cured acrylate resin-CdSe/ZnS QD nanocomposites in this work. These
fluorescent nanocomposites consisted of a small number of quantum
dots exhibiting optical features and thermal stability, so these processes
and materials are worth promoting in LED applications.

Results and Discussion
One-Step
Synthesis of CdSe/ZnS Core–Shell QDs
Figure 1a,b present
the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the synthesized
red and green quantum dots, respectively. Although the chemical composition
gradient of red and green quantum dots is different, both QDs had
a spherical shape and a narrow size ranging from 7 to 9 nm. In our
experimental conditions, the QDs exhibited a stable size distribution
of 7–9 nm corresponding to a shell (ZnS) thickness of about
1.5 nm.25Figure 1c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of CdSe/ZnS
quantum dots. The standard XRD patterns of CdSe and ZnS are labeled
at the bottom and top of Figure 1, respectively. The indicated diffraction signals (2θ)
of 26.3, 42.6, and 51.9° at the bottom represent the respective
(111), (220), and (311) crystal planes (JCPDS 19-0191) of the zinc
blende cubic crystal structure of CdSe. The indicated diffraction
signals of 28.5, 47.515, and 56.28° at the top represent the
respective (111), (220), and (311) crystal planes (JCPDS 05-0566)
of the zinc blende cubic crystal structure of ZnS. Note that the diffraction
signals of the quantum dots prepared in this work are present at 28.14,
47.13, and 55.78°, respectively. Compared with the standard diffraction
signals of CdSe and ZnS, the CdSe/ZnS diffraction peaks slightly shifted
from smaller angles (corresponding to the CdSe crystal) to larger
angles (corresponding to the ZnS crystal). This implies that the synthesized
quantum dots have a core–shell structure.25

quantum dots (b). X-ray diffraction of green and red-mixed CdSe/ZnS
quantum dots (c).

Figure 2 demonstrates
a picture of synthesized quantum dots irradiated by sun light and
green (532 nm) and red (628 nm) light emission excited by ultraviolet
light. As shown in Figure 2a, UV–visible spectra were measured using toluene as
the background and then the synthesized quantum dots were diluted
in toluene to measure the corresponding absorption spectra. Figure 2b shows the fluorescence
spectra of the synthesized CdSe/ZnS excited at a wavelength of 440
nm, exhibiting that the peak positions of CdSe/ZnS are present at
532 and 628 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 28, respectively,
corresponding to green and red emitting light. Note that a plurality
of exciton peaks appears in the UV–vis absorption spectrum
and the luminescence spectrum shows a single narrow Gaussian PL peak
having a FWHM of less than 35 nm. This implies that the synthesized
QD is uniform in size and shape, so it can be inferred that the chemical
composition of these QDs is also uniform. This result is consistent
with TEM results with uniform size and shape.

dots (b).

Quantum Dot–Polyacrylate
Hybrid Light-Emitting Films
Figure 3 demonstrates
the cross-sectional energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping of
CdSe/ZnS (0.1 wt %) quantum dot–polymer hybrid light-emitting
films. To identify the dispersibility of quantum dots in the polymer
matrix, the cross-section of the QD–polymer hybrid light-emitting
film was characterized by EDS. The elements of Zn, S, and Se are uniformly
distributed in the polymer matrix, suggesting that the quantum dots
are well-dispersed in the B2 polymer. But, the signal of Cd is less
obvious, presumably because Cd has a higher bind energy.

Figure 4 shows
a
topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and a three-dimensional
surface profile of the CdSe/ZnS-B2 polymer nanocomposite film prepared
by spin-coating and UV curing. In Figure 4a, the bright spots correspond to the QD
particles and the dark areas correspond to the B2 polymer matrix.
The examination of Figure 4a reveals that the spherical aggregates have a relatively
uniform spot distribution due to the QD aggregates separated within
the polymer domain. The particle size distribution at about 33 nm
corresponds to a QD cluster comprising several individual QDs (diameter
7–10 nm, see Figure 1a,b), indicating that the oleic acid (OA)-capped QDs tend
to aggregate generating QD clusters, but these QDs are relatively
uniformly distributed in the cured polymer matrix. In addition, some
small hillocks are relatively uniformly distributed in the three-dimensional
image of the nanocomposite film as shown in Figure 4b, corresponding to an average roughness
of about ∼6 nm.

surface
profile image of the green and red-mixed CdSe/ZnS QD (0.1 wt %) polymer
hybrid light-emitting films.

Figure 5 shows
the
results of thermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermogravimetry (DTG). It can be seen from Figure 5a that the 5% decomposition temperature of
the CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer hybrid film and the neat polymer film
presented at 257.9 and 287.6 °C, respectively, indicative of
the significant ligands of TOP/oleic acid-capped QDs. Our result is
similar to the previous study of TGA followed by Fourier transform
infrared analysis.28 In Figure 5b, the maximum decomposition
temperature (446.5 °C) of the CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer hybrid
film was slightly higher than that (431.6 °C) of the neat polymer,
reflecting that the involvement of inorganic CdSe/ZnS QDs in the polymer
matrix would increase the maximum decomposition temperature. Consequently,
the thermal stability can be improved in CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer
hybrid films.

hybrid light-emitting films: (a) TGA and (b) DTG analysis. B2: UV-cured

In this study, photopolymerization was used to
rapidly prepare
a smooth surface of QD–polymer hybrid light-emitting films.
In order to increase compatibility, the functional groups of the oligomers
in the above hybrid films should match well with the polarity of the
ligands on quantum dots. Then, the photoinitiator was added to the
mixture of quantum dots and oligomer and uniformly mixed. The above
mixture was spin-coated on a glass substrate and then subjected to
ultraviolet light irradiation. A single-color QD–polymer hybrid
light-emitting film can be obtained using this photopolymerization. Figure 6 shows the CIE-1931
coordinates and PL spectra of the green and red quantum dot–polymer
hybrid light-emitting films. It can be seen that the quantum dots
are well-dispersed in the B2 polymer. This is evidenced by the fact
that the emission wavelength (green at 532 nm and red at 628 nm, respectively)
of QD–polymer hybrid films is almost the same as that of the
quantum dots dispersed in toluene, which ensures that the quantum
dots are well compatible with the B2 polymer leading to no suspicion
on the emission wavelength shift in subsequent applications. The CIE-1931
coordinates of green and red QD–polymer hybrid films located
at (0.13, 0.64) and (0.67, 0.32) corresponds to the wavelength of
532 and 628 nm, respectively.

hybrid
light-emitting films (∼1 mm thickness), emission wavelength:
(a) 532 nm and (b) 628 nm.

In general, the PL emission intensity of quantum dots decreases
with increasing temperature. Because heating makes the ligands peel
off the surface of the quantum dot, resulting in agglomeration of
the quantum dots, and thus reducing their luminous intensity. In addition,
thermal energy also affects electronic transitions, especially the
recombination of electron–holes, which in turn leads to a significant
drop in the luminous intensity. This fluorescence heat quenching of
quantum dots presents in a silicone package using the conventional
thermal curing process.29−33 To reduce the above disadvantages of fluorescence heat quenching,
we have tried to employ a photopolymerization process. In Figure 7, the emission intensity
of green quantum dots in the B2 polymer matrix after photopolymerization
retains about 90% intensity before photopolymerization. Compared with
a silicone package using the conventional thermal curing process,
this result fully demonstrates that the use of photopolymerization
has a major advantage of emission stability over the thermal curing
process. It can be explained that the preparation of the QD–polymer
hybrid light-emitting film by the photopolymerization method not only
has a fast process speed but can also reduce the damage to the materials
of quantum dots. Red quantum dots have a similar result to that of
green quantum dots.

films. (a) PL spectra and (b) samples of before and after photopolymerization.

Red and green quantum dots are
added with an appropriate ratio
to the mixture of oligomer, monomer, and photoinitiator. The well-mixed
dispersion was spin-coated on the surface of the blue LED chip and
subjected to ultraviolet light irradiation to complete a white light
LED device. In lighting the blue chip, the emitted blue light excited
the mixed QDs to emit green and red lights, whereas the blue light,
green light, and red light are mixed together to obtain white light
emitting LED (as shown in Figure 8). Figure 8 also shows the PL spectra and the CIE-1931 coordinate of
the white LED. PL spectra exhibit blue, green, and red peaks corresponding
to the blue chip, green QD, and red QD emission, respectively. The
above three primary colors are mixed to obtain white light located
at CIE-1931 coordinate of 0.3339 and 0.3192 in the present study.

and CIE coordinate of white light LED devices derived
from red and green CdSe/ZnS QD–polymer hybrid films excited
by a blue chip.

We also investigate
the variation of the color rendering index
(CRI), color temperature (Tc), and light
extraction efficiency of the white LEDs operated at different current
densities. In Figure 9a, the value of the CRI increases with the increase in the operating
current density, because the increased operating current density results
in an increase of the emission band width which eventually leads to
an increase in the CRI value.4Figure 9b shows the corresponding
color temperature of the sample operating at different current densities,
revealing that the value of Tc decreases
with the increase in the operating current density from 14 500
(refer to 10 mA) to 5600 K (refer to 50 mA) corresponding clear sky
and blazing sun at noon, respectively. Figure 9c shows the light extraction efficiency of
the sample operating at different current densities, revealing that
the efficiency reaches a maximum of 14% at a current density of 30
mA, whereas the overall value falls on average around 10–12%.
This value is similar to other matrix materials (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Chemical Structure of the B2 Aliphatic Acrylic Acrylate Oligomer
A traditional liquid crystal
television using a white light-emitting
diode (WLED) as a backlight is called an “LED-TV”, which
uses a color filter to generate three colors of RGB light. Therefore,
red and green quantum dots can be directly printed between the two
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films to replace the role of the
backlight on the panel. High adhesion of the quantum dot–polymer
hybrid is required in the real application. The 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl
methacrylate (TMSPMA) monomer having methoxysilyl groups is generally
considered to enhance the adhesion on PET sheets. Furthermore, the
light extraction efficiency of the quantum dot–polymer composite
films would not be significantly influenced by the addition of TMSPMA
lower than 10 wt %. In this work, the TMSPMA monomer was added into
the mixture of CdSe/ZnS (0.1 wt %) quantum dot–B2 oligomer
hybrid white light-emitting formulation to enhance adhesion between
the two PET plastic substrates (2 cm × 2 cm) after photopolymerization.
The pull-off strength was measured by a universal material testing
machine to obtain the relationship between the TMSPMA content and
pull-off strength. As shown in Figure 10, it can be observed that the pull-off strength
increases with the increasing TMSPMA addition to reach a maximum value
of 8.9 N/cm2 at 5 wt % TMSPMA. The enhancement is just
43.5% higher compared to that (6.2 N/cm2) without the addition
of TMSPMA. This result arises from the hydrolysis of Si–(OCH3)3 forming Si–(OH)3 as shown
in Scheme 2,I, the
dehydrated condensation between Si–OH and hydrogen bonding
between Si–OH and −OH groups on the surface of the PET
substrate is as shown in Scheme 2,II. These sequence reactions can be expressed in Scheme 2.34

methacrylate monomer addition in the CdSe/ZnS (0.1 wt %) quantum dot–polymer

PET films.

However, the amount of TMSPMA added more than 5 wt % TMSPMA, the
pull-off strength does not keep rising but decreases from 8.9 to 7.25
N/cm2 at 10 wt % TMSPMA. The enhancement is just 16.9%
higher compared to that (6.2 N/cm2) without the addition
of TMSPMA. This is because TMSPMA is a monofunctional monomer. When
the addition of TMSPMA is increased higher than 5 wt %, the polymer
chains formed by photopolymerization is not long as that of 5 wt %
TMSPMA addition. It is worth noting that the addition of 5 wt % TMSPMA
has no significant effect on the transparency of the hybrid film and
the light extraction efficiency of white LEDs.

Conclusions
In this study, oleic acid-capped CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs
were incorporated into an aliphatic acrylate polymer by the solution
mixing method, followed by photopolymerization. The small amounts
of QD clusters were uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix. The
prepared nanocomposite consisted of 0.1 wt % of CdSe/ZnS QDs showing
stable optical properties, achieving high white LED performance of
7976 lm/m2 under a 30 mA working current. The light emission
efficiency, CRI, and the color temperature of 14%, 47, and 11 204
K, were obtained at this current. Meanwhile, the incorporation of
a small amount of QDs improved the thermal stability of the polymer
matrix. These results are important for the practical application
of electroluminescent LED devices using the QD package.

Single-Step Synthesis of
CdSe/ZnS Quantum Dots with Chemical
Composition Gradients
The single-step synthesis method, a
typical synthetic procedure to synthesize green QDs,25,26 was employed to synthesize CdSe/ZnS quantum dots in this work. In
brief, 0.4 mmol of cadmium oxide, 4 mmol of zinc acetate, and 4.971
g (17.6 mmol) of oleic acid (OA) were placed in a 250 mL three-necked
flask. The mixture was heated to 150 °C, degassed 0.1 Torr pressure
to remove water for 30 min, purged with N2 gas, and heated
to 300 °C and 10 mL of 1-octadecene (ODE) was injected into the
reacted mixture forming a clear solution of Cd(OA)2 and
Zn(OA)2. At 300 °C, 0.4 mmol of selenium and 4 mmol
of sulfur powder were dissolved in 3 mL of trioctylphosphine and were
rapidly injected into the above reactor. The reaction was set at 300
°C for 10 min to promote the growth of CdSe/ZnS core–shell
QDs and the reactor was cooled to room temperature to stop the reaction.
These QDs were further purified by the addition of toluene (20 mL)
and excess ethanol three times; they were finally redispersed in toluene.

To synthesize red QDs,27 1 mmol of cadmium
oxide, 4 mmol of zinc acetate, and 5 mL of oleic acid were placed
in a 250 mL three-necked flask. The mixture was heated to 150 °C,
degassed 0.1 Torr pressure to remove water for 30 min, purged with
N2 gas, and heated to 300 °C and 15 mL of 1-octadecene
(ODE) was injected into the reacted mixture forming a clear solution
of Cd(OA)2 and Zn(OA)2. At 300 °C, 0.4
mL of 1 M selenium-dissolved trioctylphosphine solution was added
to the above mixture, 4 mmol of sulfur powder was dissolved in 4 mL
of trioctylphosphine and were injected into the reactor in 30 s. The
reaction was set at 300 °C for 10 min to promote the growth of
CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs, and the reactor was cooled to room
temperature to stop the reaction. These QDs were further purified
by the addition of toluene (20 mL) and excess ethanol three times;
they were finally redispersed in toluene.

Preparation of QD–Polyacrylate
Hybrid Light-Emitting
Films
A mixed photoinitiator (5 wt % for total mixture, TPO/Irgacure
184/Irgacure 907 = 2:2:1, by weight ratio) was added to the mixture
of quantum dots, B2 oligomer (Scheme 1, molecular distribution refers to Supporting Information), and monomers. The mixture was uniformly
mixed and then spin-coated on the glass substrate. The single-color
organic light-emitting film was obtained by photopolymerization using
36 W UV light for 1.5 min. The thickness of the organic light-emitting
film was controlled at about 1 mm by adjusting the speed of spin-coating.

Fabrication of White LEDs
Red and green quantum dots
were blended with an appropriate ratio and added to a mixture of oligomer,
monomer, and photoinitiator. This mixture was stirred to obtain a
uniform dispersion of QDs and dropped on the surface of a blue LED
chip (emitting wavelength at 460 nm) which was then photopolymerized
through irradiation for 90 s on 36 WLED-bulb UV light. When the switch
of the QD-hybrid film covered blue chip was turned on, a white light-emitting
LED was obtained and the PL spectrum and CIE-1931 coordinates were
measured.

Characterization and Measurements
Particle shape and
size of the quantum dots were estimated by using a transmission electron
microscope (TEM, JEM-1230, JEOL Ltd., Japan) using an acceleration
voltage of 80 kV. The film surface morphology was observed on a field
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, S4800). An
energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Genesis XM 4i Energy Dispersive
X-ray Analysis System, FEI) was used to observe elemental distribution
of cross-section in QD–polymer hybrid films, confirming the
dispersion of QDs in the polymer matrix. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images were taken for samples on a NT-MDT Solver PRO-M AFM operated
at 200 kV. The crystal structures of CdSe-QDs were measured using
an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE X) with Cu radiation. UV–vis
absorption and transmittance spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda UV–vis spectrophotometer using toluene as a background.
The as-prepared quantum dots were diluted using toluene and placed
in a quartz cell for measurement. The as-prepared quantum dots were
diluted using toluene and placed in a quartz cell, and the prepared
organic light-emitting film was placed on a solid stand. Photoluminescence
(PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer
exciting at a wavelength of 440 nm to confirm the peak position of
the fluorescence emission spectrum of the material. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was measured on a thermogravimetric analyzer (SDT-Q600,
TA) scanning from 25 to 800 °C. The analysis was performed at
initial temperatures of 25 and 120 °C for 10 min to remove water
at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The CIE coordinates of a white
LED device and QD-hybrid light-emitting film were determined on a
lighting spectrometer (Model 14-1, Lighting Passport) using a UV light
source excited at a wavelength of 365 nm. The fabricated white LEDs
were employed to measure the color rendering index (CRI) and color
temperature at different current densities from 10 to 50 mA. The luminous
flux was measured by different current densities of 10–50 mA
for the fabricated white LEDs and the original blue LED chip, respectively.
The light extraction efficiency was calculated using the ratio of
the above two luminous flux.
