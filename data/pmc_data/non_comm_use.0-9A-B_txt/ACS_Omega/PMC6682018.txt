Aqueous hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI),
is rapidly reduced to trivalent
chromium, Cr(III), by exposure to (polystyrylmethyl)trimethylammonium
borohydride and with Amberlite-supported mild bases in a heterogeneous
environment. Post-reaction removal of the insoluble reagents leaves
no remediation-based chemical footprint in the source water. Time
dependence with stirred and static conditions is discussed.

Introduction
Chromium(VI) is a well-documented health
risk1,2 in
drinking water, whereas its reduced oxidation state, chromium(III),
is a necessary human nutrient used for processing sugars, proteins,
and fat. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
set a safe standard of 0.1 mg/L or 0.8 μM of all chromium ions.3 Aqueous Cr(VI) is most often found in the form
of chromate (CrO42–) or dichromate (Cr2O72–) ions. Under normal environmental
pH values, hexavalent chromium is found exclusively as HCrO4– at pH < 6.5 and chromate at pH > 6.5. Cr(VI)
in ground water is a byproduct of many industrial processes1,4−7 and can be formed by the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) by metal
oxides or chlorination.8 Physical methods
of Cr(VI) removal used in water treatment sites and some point of
use applications depend on adsorption, filtration, or ion exchange
technologies.9−11 Alternatively, Cr(VI) elimination strategies rely
on the chemical transformation of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). This redox reaction
has been accomplished on the interfacial surface of commercial activated
carbon adsorbents, Fe(0)12−14 and biochar.15 Soluble reducing reagents, such as l-ascorbic
acid,16,17 Fe(II),18 H2S,19 H2O2,20 and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) buffered with sodium borate,21 among
others, are also effective.4 However, a
serious consequence of removing Cr(VI) under reduction conditions
is the introduction of new pollutants to the water source. As an example,
the reduction of chromate to Cr(III) with a sodium borate buffered
solution of NaBH4 is shown in Scheme 1.21 Inherent in
this protocol is the cross-contamination of the water source with
sodium borohydride (4 molar excess), boric acid byproducts, and sodium
borate buffer (1000 μM) which necessitates an additional remediation
step.22

Scheme 1 Reaction of NaBH4, Sodium
Borate and Potassium Dichromate
at pH 8–10 to Furnished Cr(III) and Boric Acid Species
We report on an environmentally
benign approach for Cr(VI) reduction
which relies on the use of borohydride exchange resin, A (Scheme 2). Specifically,
borohydride is attached to a water insoluble ion exchange resin (Amberlite).23 This reagent has found uses in organic synthesis
for the reduction of a variety of functional groups through hydride
delivery mechanisms. In other instances, borohydride serves as a single
electron donor reducing agent24,25 in the reduction of
acridinium cation26 and selenium.27 Furthermore, to avoid contamination of the source
water with high concentrations of buffer, we employ insoluble bases
to act as mild buffering agents, such as attached to Amberlite (B).
A distinct advantage of this heterogeneous reaction (Scheme 2) for the reduction of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III) is the simplified post reaction work-ups requiring only
filtration of the resin-bound borate reagents (A and C) and bases
(B). Afterward, only Cr(III) species would remain in the water.

Borohydride (C), along with (B), and after Filtration, Only Solutions

Experimental Procedure
Reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific or Sigma-Aldrich
and used without purification. Polymer-supported reagents were obtained
from Biotage USA: macroporous borohydride (A) (MP-BH4;
#800401; 2.95 mmol/g; 655 μm mean bead size), ISOLUTE Si-Tris-amine
(B1; #9495-0010; 1.6 mmol/g), and MP-carbonate (B2; #800267; 2.9 mmol/g).
Amberlite IRA-400 chloride form was purchased from Fisher Scientific.
Deionized water is used throughout. Spectroscopic measurements of
the chromate solution concentration were measured on a Metash Model
V-5000 Visible Spectrophotometer at 372 nm. The average of duplicate
or triplicate experiments and the range of chromate reductions are
reported.

Typical Procedure (Scheme 3) for the Preparation of Amberlite-Supported Base B3
To a solution of glycine (1.00 g; 13.3 mmol) in 10 mL water in
a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask was added 1.33 mL of 10 N NaOH. The solution
was stirred for 5 min, and 1 g of freshly washed Amberlite (IRA-400
chloride form; 1.4 mequiv/mL) was added. The mixture was stirred 60
min (1″ × 1″ stir bar at 300 rpm), filtered, washed
thoroughly with water, and dried at room temperature.

Typical Procedure
for the Removal of Cr(VI)
To a solution (20 mL) of aqueous
K2Cr2O7 (200 μM) were added
MP-BH4 (A) (20 mg) and
a polymer-supported base (B) (20 mg). The mixture is stirred for 120
min, or earlier times for kinetic analysis, (1″ × 1″
stir bar at 300 rpm), and an aliquot was removed for spectroscopic
analysis. The percent Cr(VI) reduction was calculated in eq 1. 1  where λmax[stock] is the
UV absorption at 372 nm of the stock solution of Cr(VI). The λmax[sample] is the UV absorption at 372 nm of the sample treated
with (A).

Results and Discussion
Sodium borohydride can be utilized
as a one electron-reducing agent
for the removal of Cr(VI) from water sources.21 However, its use, along with high concentrations sodium borate buffer
(1000 μM), presents a challenge for complete water remediation22 by introducing new chemical pollutants. To exploit
the reducing ability of borohydride, we adopted a water-insoluble
borohydride variant in the form of polymer-supported borohydride (A)
which is removed upon completion of water remediation, as in C. To
understand the molar requirements needed for a resin-bound one electron-reducing
agent to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), we varied the molar ratio of A
and Cr(VI). Table 1 shows the results of reducing a 200 μM solution of K2Cr2O7. The results indicate that 10 molar equivalents
of A is necessary to completely reduce Cr(VI) levels within 120 min.
Fewer molar equivalents of A require longer reaction times (data not
shown). The need for excess reagent may reflect chromate’s
slow accessibility to some borohydride reagent within the porous resin.

To determine the minimum amount of buffer needed to slow the decomposition
of borohydride to boric acid,28 the concentration
of sodium borate was varied. The results in Table 2 indicate that sodium borate is effective
at low concentrations—94% reduction of Cr(VI) at 25 μM.
However, in the absence of buffer (pH 6.3), the competitive reaction
of hydrolysis of borohydride to boric acid occurs faster than chromate
reduction.

With these results in hand, we sought to further reduce the remediation
footprint by using commercial insoluble mild organic bases (B1–B2)
or attaching mild bases to Amberlite to form insoluble reagents B3–B5. Scheme 3 shows the reaction of Amberlite (IRA-400 chloride form) with N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES) in the aqueous
base to form B4.

The physical properties of
the bases B1–B5 are shown in Table 3.

a The capacity is
calculated from
titration values using 0.1 M HCl and phenolphthalein as an indicator.
The pH value is taken with 20 mg of B1–B5 in 10 mL distilled
water under static conditions.

The results from Table 4 using insoluble bases B1–B5 to aid in pH maintenance
indicate that B2–B5 furnish suitable environments for the removal
Cr(VI) to occur, with reduction values of 82–99%. Reports on
the complexation of chromate with tertiary alkyl amines have been
reported,29,30 which in the case of B1 may be responsible
for the decrease in Cr(VI) reactivity with the borohydride reagent.
With these bases, a range of pH values (7.55–8.96) were effective
in controlling the rate of decomposition of borohydride to boric acid.28 After removal of all insoluble material, the
source water, containing Cr(III), has a pH value of 8.7–8.9
compared to a pH of 6.3 for the initial 200 μM Cr(VI) solution.

a The pH values indicate basicity
after completion of the reaction and after filtration.

To establish the potential reusability
of the bases attached to
the insoluble beads, a series of Cr(VI) reduction reactions were undertaken,
wherein B4 was confined to a tea bag. After each reaction was complete
(30 min), the bag was removed and immersed into a new Cr(VI) solution
with MP-BH4. The results (data not shown) show that over
the course of three reactions, the percent reduction of Cr(VI) varied
by only 9%. Thus, the base-containing beads can be reused in additional
remediation reactions.

To understand the contribution of the
physical environment to the
success of the heterogeneous reaction of chromate with MP-BH4 (A) and B4, the reaction was evaluated under different mixing conditions. Figure 1 shows the rate of
Cr(VI) reduction in a stirring versus a static situation. When stirred
at 300 rpm, a 95% reduction occurs within 30 min. However, at static
conditions, a 9% reduction is observed. An initial rate of Cr(VI)
removal in a stirred reaction of 140 μM/10 min. was calculated
while the initial rate for static was 8 μM/10 min. The fast
initial rate is likely due to a more efficient diffusion of chromate
into the porous cavities of A that is required for contact with the
borohydride species.

Conclusions
Synthetic water, containing
very high levels of Cr(VI), can be
effectively and quickly remediated with the use of two polymer-supported
reagents. The reagents attached to the insoluble beads, borohydride
and a mild base, reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The water, after filtration
of the reagents, will contain only Cr(III) ions and any purification
of remediation-based chemicals is not required.
