Genetic mutations
in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene affecting
the expression of dystrophin protein lead to a number of muscle disorders
collectively called dystrophinopathies. In addition to muscle dystrophin,
mutations in brain-specific dystrophin isoforms, in particular those
that are expressed in the brain cortex and Purkinje neurons, result
in cognitive impairment associated with DMD. These isoforms carry
minor variations in the flanking region of the N-terminal actin-binding
domain (ABD1) of dystrophin, which is composed of two calponin-homology
(CH) domains in tandem. Determining the effect of these sequence variations
is critical for understanding the mechanisms that govern varied symptoms
of the disease. We studied the impact of differences in the N-terminal
flanking region on the structure and function of dystrophin tandem
CH domain isoforms. The amino acid changes did not affect the global
structure of the protein but drastically affected the thermodynamic
stability, with the muscle isoform more stable than the brain and
Purkinje isoforms. Actin binding investigated with actin from different
sources (skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and platelets)
revealed that the muscle isoform binds to filamentous actin (F-actin)
with a lower affinity compared to the brain and Purkinje isoforms,
and a similar trend was observed with actin from different sources.
In addition, all isoforms showed a higher affinity to smooth muscle
actin in comparison to actin from other sources. In conclusion, tandem
CH domain isoforms might be using minor sequence variations in the
N-terminal flanking regions to modulate their thermodynamic stability
and actin-binding function, thus leading to specificity in dystrophin–actin
interactions in various tissues.

Introduction
Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD) is an X-linked genetic disorder
caused by the absence or loss of function of dystrophin protein (UniProtKB P11532).1−4 It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration,
finally leading to death at an early age due to cardiac or respiratory
failure.5 One of the major functions of
dystrophin includes binding to actin cytoskeleton using its N-terminal
actin-binding domain (N-ABD or ABD1).6,7 At least seven
different promoters exist on the DMD gene that lead to tissue-specific
expression of dystrophin isoforms with different lengths.2 Transcription from the first three promoters
leads to the expression of full-length (427 kDa) dystrophin isoforms:
muscle dystrophin (in skeletal and cardiac muscles), brain dystrophin
(in the hippocampus and the cortex in the brain), and Purkinje dystrophin
(in cerebellar Purkinje neurons), named based on their major site
of localization.8,9 Other promoters lead to the expression
of progressively shorter isoforms from the N-terminus (260, 140, 116,
and 71 kDa) lacking the ABD1 (Figure 1a). Each of the three full-length isoforms [muscle
(DP427M or Dys-M), brain (DP427B or Dys-B), and Purkinje (DP427P or
Dys-P)] is encoded by a unique first exon and a set of common exons
from 2 to 79, leading to variations in the N-terminal flanking region.
In this study, we examined how these minor sequence variations at
the N-terminus affect the structure and function of dystrophin ABD1.

comparison of actin-binding tandem calponin-homology (CH) domains
of muscle, Purkinje, and brain isoforms. (A) A schematic representation
of the dystrophin gene and isoforms resulting from transcription initiating
from different promoters. The position of promoters is represented
on the gene with curved arrows as muscle (M), Purkinje (P) neurons,
brain (B), retina (R), brain, kidney (B3), peripheral nervous
system (S), and ubiquitous (G). Transcription initiation from M, P,
and B promoters utilizes a unique first exon and produces protein
products with a molecular weight of ∼427 kDa, which are represented
as DP427M (Dys-M), DP427P (Dys-P), and DP427B (Dys-B) respectively.
Transcription from R, B3, S, and G promoters initiates
with exon 30, 45, 56, and 63 and produces protein products with molecular
weights of 260 kDa (DP260), 140 kDa (DP140), 116 kDa (DP116), and
71 kDa (DP71), respectively. (B) Sequence alignment of the tandem
CH domains of Dys-M, Dys-P, and Dys-B. The amino acid sequence translated
from the unique first exon is shown in bold letters in black (Dys-M),
red (Dys-P), and blue (Dys-B). The rest of the amino acid sequence
is identical for the three isoforms. The figure also shows the three
actin-binding surfaces (ABS1, ABS2, and ABS3) through which dystrophin
tandem CH domain interacts with actin. (C) Multiple sequence alignment
of six actin isoforms at the amino acid level. Sequence differences
are shown in bold letters. Differences in the N-terminal acidic residues
are shown in green. Unique amino acid substitutions in a single isoform
are represented by cyan, and substitutions in two isoforms are represented
by red. Amino acids present in the majority of isoforms are represented
by black.

Dystrophin ABD1 is composed of
two calponin-homology (CH) domains
in tandem. Similar tandem domains are present in a number of actin-binding
proteins including utrophin, α-actinin, spectrin, and fimbrin.10−12 Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal (CH1) and C-terminal
(CH2) domains contribute differentially to the stability and function
of dystrophin and utrophin tandem CH domains, with CH1 domains being
unstable but with a higher binding affinity for filamentous actin
(F-actin).13−15 CH2 domains do not bind to actin but provide stability
to ABD1.13,15 Utrophin tandem CH domain contains a long
23-amino-acid flanking region compared to dystrophin tandem CH domain,
and deleting this region impacts the stability and actin-binding affinity
of the tandem CH domain, making the truncated utrophin tandem CH domain
behave similar to that of dystrophin with a shorter flanking region.16 A similar role for the N-terminal flanking regions
has been recently proposed for other tandem CH domains.17−19 The ABD1 of the three dystrophin isoforms (muscle, Purkinje, and
brain) is composed of 246, 242, and 238 amino acid residues, respectively,
and the only difference lies in their N-terminal flanking regions
before the first actin-binding site (ABS1) (Figure 1b). An 11 amino acid stretch in muscle dystrophin
is replaced by 7 amino acids in Purkinje dystrophin and 3 amino acids
in brain dystrophin. We examined how these three naturally occurring
isoforms use minor sequence variations in their flanking regions to
modulate the thermodynamic stability and actin-binding function, and
whether they lead to tissue specificity of dystrophin–actin
interactions.

Similar to dystrophin, actin also exists in multiple
isoforms with
nearly identical amino acid sequences but coded by six different genes
(Figure 1c).20 Actin isoforms have a conserved amino acid sequence
across species, and the six genes encoding them are also evolutionary
conserved. Like dystrophin, actin isoforms show tissue-specific expression,
with β- and γ-actin ubiquitously expressed, while other
actin isoforms expressed in specific muscle tissues. This indicates
the importance of different isoforms of actin and led to the hypothesis
that actin isoforms perform nonredundant functions in respective tissues.
Animal knockout studies have shown that specific actin isoforms perform
specialized functions, which cannot be taken over by concomitant up-regulation
of other isoforms.20,21 Biochemical and biophysical studies
have shown that despite a difference of a few amino acids mainly in
their N-terminal flanking regions (Figure 1c), distinct actin isoforms have differing
properties in terms of their polymerization and depolymerization potential,22,23 Thus, similar to dystrophin, minor variations in the amino acid
sequence and tissue specificity of actin isoforms may be an important
factor in determining actin–dystrophin interactions. In addition,
specificity might exist in actin–dystrophin interactions, i.e.,
a particular dystrophin isoform may be able to distinguish different
actin isoforms in terms of actin-binding affinity, which has not been
examined before.

In this study, we examined how the tandem CH
domains of the three
naturally occurring dystrophin isoforms use their minor variations
in the N-terminal flanking regions to modulate their stability and
actin-binding function. In addition to determining the amino acid
sequence of the protein (Figure 1a), transcription from different promoters can also
control the levels of transcript and protein levels, leading to tissue
specificity.8,24 Since dystrophin isoforms are
expressed in different tissues and the actin isoform expression pattern
also varies with the tissue type, we also examined whether different
isoforms of the dystrophin tandem CH domain can differentiate between
actin isoforms in terms of their binding affinity.

Results
Purification
and Characterization of Proteins
Tandem
CH domains of the three dystrophin isoforms were expressed in high
yield in Escherichia coli, using the
protocols described in the Materials and Methods section. Proteins were obtained from soluble fraction and purified
to homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity
chromatography. Figure 2a shows the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) of the three purified isoforms. Native-PAGE analysis (Figure 2b) shows the three
isoforms as homogenous preparations. The tandem CH domain of Dys-M
migrates slightly faster toward the positively charged electrode compared
to the other two proteins because of the presence of two additional
acidic residues in its N-terminal flanking region.

tandem CH domains. Lanes labeled Dys-M, Dys-P, and Dys-B correspond

and brain cortex isoforms of dystrophin, respectively. Lane labeled
M represents the molecular weight markers (180, 130, 100, 70, 55,
40, 35, 25, 15, and 10 kDa from top to bottom). (C) Far-UV circular
dichroism (CD) and (D) intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of
dystrophin tandem CH domain isoforms: Dys-M (black), Dys-P (red),
and Dys-B (blue). Solid and dashed lines in panel D represent the
fluorescence spectra of native and denatured states, respectively.

Secondary and tertiary structure characterization
of the three
tandem CH domains was performed by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence
spectroscopy (Figure 2c,d). CD spectra of the proteins showed a characteristic signature
of α-helical proteins with major negative bands at 222 and 208
nm.25 The three spectra were indistinguishable
suggesting similar content of the secondary structural components
in the three isoforms. This indicates that differences in the N-terminal
flanking region did not affect the secondary structure of dystrophin
tandem CH domain isoforms, consistent with earlier studies on other
tandem CH domains.16,17 Fluorescence spectrum of the
tandem CH domain of Dys-M in its native state showed emission maximum
red-shifted compared to those of Dys-P and Dys-B. Fluorescence emission
after excitation at 295 nm gives selective information on the environment
of tryptophan residues.26 Fluorescence
emission spectra of exposed tryptophan residues are red-shifted compared
to buried tryptophan residues. The tandem CH domain of Dys-M contains
eight tryptophan residues as opposed to six in the tandem CH domains
of Dys-P and Dys-B. The two additional tryptophans in the tandem CH
domain of Dys-M are present in its unstructured N-terminal flanking
region, which explains why its fluorescence spectrum is relatively
red-shifted compared to those of Dys-P and Dys-B. The urea denatured
state of all of the three isoforms showed similar emission spectra
with maxima at 354 nm, suggesting similar exposure of tryptophan residues
upon denaturation.

Tandem CH Domain of Muscle Dystrophin Is
More Stable Than Those
of Purkinje and Brain Isoforms
The stability of the three
isoforms was compared using urea and thermal denaturation. The CD
signal at 222 nm and fluorescence emission at 320 nm were used as
probes for the secondary and tertiary structures of the proteins to
record the urea denaturation profiles (Figure 3a,b). For thermal denaturation, in addition
to CD and fluorescence (Figure 3c,d), optical density (OD) at 350 nm was used as a probe to
monitor protein aggregation (data is not shown). Urea and thermal
denaturation profiles were fit to a two-state unfolding model (eqs 1, 2, and 4 in the Materials and
Methods section) to obtain the free energy of unfolding at
zero denaturant concentration (ΔG°unf), the slope of linear variation of ΔGunf with denaturant concentration (m-value),
midpoint denaturant concentration of the melt (Cm), and midpoint temperature of the thermal melt (Tm) (Tables 1 and S1).

respectively.

a At least two data sets from two
independent protein preparations were used for the data analysis.

Urea denaturation profiles
with both fluorescence and CD showed
that the tandem CH domain of Dys-M is more stable compared to those
of Dys-P and Dys-B. ΔG°unf, Cm, and m-values obtained for
a given protein by individually fitting fluorescence and CD denaturant
melts to a two-state equilibrium unfolding model (eqs 1 and 2 in
the Materials and Methods section) agreed
well with each other (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information). Therefore, the fluorescence and CD data were analyzed
globally to fit to a two-state equilibrium unfolding model (eqs 1 and 2) by sharing the ΔG°unf, Cm, and m-values between the
data sets. At least two data sets (from different batches of protein
purification) of each protein were analyzed for each probe, i.e.,
CD and fluorescence. ΔG°unf for Dys-M tandem CH domain was 11.86 ± 0.34 kcal/mol, whereas
that for the tandem CH domains of Dys-P and Dys-B were 6.30 ±
0.30 and 6.82 ± 0.26 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that
the tandem CH domain of Dys-M is stable by ∼5 kcal/mol compared
to those of the other two isoforms. Similarly, the m-value for Dys-M tandem CH domains was −2.13 ± 0.06 kcal/(mol
M) [urea] compared to −1.20 ± 0.06 and −1.32 ±
0.05 kcal/(mol M) [urea] for the tandem CH domains of Dys-P and Dys-B,
respectively. The m-value is a measure of the change
in the accessible surface area upon denaturation and thus is also
a measure of the compactness of a protein in the native state in the
case of two-state folders.27 However, since
the dystrophin tandem CH domain contains two domains in tandem and
folds in a non-two-state manner,28 decreases
in m-value might represent an increased population
of partially unfolded state(s) between native and unfolded states.29

Temperature denaturation profiles recorded
using CD at 222 nm reflect
secondary structural changes with temperature (Figure 3c), while those recorded using fluorescence
emission at 355 nm (Figure 3d) give information about changes in the tertiary structure
of the protein with temperature. Thermal denaturation recorded using
OD at 350 nm showed an increase in light scattering, implying aggregation
of these proteins with temperature (data is not shown). Since the
thermal denaturation was irreversible, the data was analyzed only
qualitatively for Tm comparison. Like
the results obtained above for chemical denaturation, thermal denaturation
also reveals higher stability for the tandem CH domain of Dys-M compared
to those of Dys-P and Dys-B as reflected in the Tm values measured using both CD and fluorescence as probes
(Table 1).

Isoform Specificity
and Actin-Binding Function of Dystrophin
Tandem CH Domain Isoforms
Tandem CH domains of dystrophin
isoforms were tested for binding to actin obtained from different
sources (skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and platelets),
using the co-sedimentation assays.13,14,16,30 Like dystrophin, actin
also exists as six distinct isoforms with well-defined tissue specificity.20 Whether these differences in the tissue-specific
expression of actin or dystrophin isoforms impact actin–dystrophin
interactions has not been examined before. Isolation of pure actin
isoforms from natural sources is challenging due to small differences
in their amino acid sequences (Figure 1c), which leads to co-purification of isoforms with
one another. Thus, in this study, actin isolated from four different
natural sources was used. Their composition in terms of actin isoforms
is shown in Table 2.

co-sedimentation assays with tandem CH domains of dystrophin
isoforms were performed for skeletal muscle actin (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), using the protocols
described earlier.14,31 The data was fit using eq 5 with Bmax fixed to 1, as observed previously for dystrophin
tandem CH domains.13,30,31 The calculated Kd values were 130 ±
7, 87 ± 4, and 109 ± 3 μM for Dys-M, Dys-P, and Dys-B
respectively (Table S2 in the Supporting
Information). To determine whether there exists a statistically significant
difference in the actin-binding affinity of different isoforms, the
co-sedimentation assays were performed with a fixed concentration
of F-actin (7 μM) incubated with 60 μM of dystrophin tandem
CH domains. The bar chart in Figure 4 was obtained after repeating the co-sedimentation
assays at least five to seven times. The binding data reflects that
the tandem CH domain of muscle dystrophin binds weakly to all of the
actin isoforms compared to those of the Purkinje and brain isoforms.
Purkinje and brain isoforms do not show such distinction among themselves,
similar to no changes in their stabilities (Figure 3 and Table 1). Also, smooth muscle actin shows stronger binding
to all dystrophin isoforms compared to the skeletal muscle, cardiac,
and non-muscle actin.

isoforms with actin from different tissues. The molar ratio of bound
dystrophin to actin calculated from the Coomassie blue-stained band

as skeletal muscle actin (Sk-M), smooth muscle actin (Sm-M), cardiac

Data labeled as Dys-M, Dys-P, and Dys-B correspond to the tandem CH
domains of muscle, Purkinje, and brain isoforms. The error bars represent
one standard error of the mean. p-Values ≤
0.01 are represented as (**), p ≤ 0.001 are
represented as (***), and p ≤ 0.0001 are represented
as (****).

To test the statistical significance
of the results obtained from
co-sedimentation assays, data presented in Figure 4 were analyzed using a two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s test for comparison of the means.
The two-way ANOVA tested the impact of two independent variables,
dystrophin isoform and actin source, on the dependent variable, which
is the amount of dystrophin tandem CH domain bound to actin (Table 3). This test also
provided information on whether or not the interaction between the
two independent variables affects the dependent variable. The results
obtained from the ANOVA are summarized in Table 4. Results show that the effect of type of
dystrophin isoform on actin–dystrophin binding was not dependent
on the source of actin, i.e., the interaction effect from the ANOVA
was not significant (p = 0.82). However, both variables,
i.e., the type of dystrophin isoform and the tissue source of actin,
influenced actin–dystrophin binding independently (p-value = 4.6 × 10–11 and 2.6 ×
10–4, respectively). A comparison of means analysis
showed that the tandem CH domain of Dys-M shows significantly weaker
binding to F-actin compared to those of Dys-P and Dys-B (p-value <1 × 10–6 for both). Also, binding
of dystrophin isoforms to smooth muscle actin is significantly stronger
from that of skeletal muscle actin (p-value = 0.003),
cardiac actin (p-value = 5.4 × 10–4), and non-muscle actin (p-value = 0.006) (Table 4).

Discussion
Minor Variations
in the N-Terminal Flanking Region Determine
the Thermodynamic Stability of Dystrophin Tandem CH Domain Isoforms
According to the results presented in this study, tandem CH domains
of dystrophin isoforms have different stabilities, with the tandem
CH domain of Dys-M being more stable by ∼5 kcal/mol than those
of Dys-P and the Dys-B. In terms of the length of the protein, a stretch
of 11 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of muscle isoform is replaced
with 7 and 3 different amino acids in Purkinje and brain isoforms,
respectively (Figure 1b). Changes in the length of protein by introduction or deletion
of amino acid residues at the N or C-terminus can affect the protein
stability.16,32−35 Also, another important determinant
for protein stability, in general, is the N and C-terminal contact.36,37 Dystrophin tandem CH domain exists in solution in a closed conformation
with its N- and C-termini closer.38 Thus,
in the closed conformation, any residue changes at the termini of
dystrophin tandem CH domain might impact protein stability by directly
influencing the N–C contact, and our experimental results presented
here on the dystrophin tandem CH domain support this hypothesis. Consistently,
deletion of the N-terminal flanking region in the case of utrophin
tandem CH domain, which exists in an open conformation,39 results in marginal stability changes.16

Protein Conformation Defines Stability–Function
Relationship
in Dystrophin Tandem CH Domain Isoforms
The variations in
the N-terminal flanking regions of dystrophin tandem CH domain isoforms
are neither part of the known actin-binding sites (ABSs) on dystrophin
(Figure 1b) nor they
are part of any stable secondary structure.40−44 Still, the results obtained in this study indicate
that minor amino acid sequence variations at the N-terminus can significantly
impact the stability and actin-binding function of tandem CH domains
of dystrophin isoforms. The variations in these isoforms are part
of the N-terminal flanking region of the CH1 domain (Figure 1b). Previous studies have shown
that CH1 and CH2 domains of dystrophin contribute differentially toward
the stability and function of its tandem CH domain.13 Actin binding is primarily determined by the unstable CH1
domain, whereas stability is determined primarily by the CH2 domain,
which does not bind to actin.13 This seems
like a general strategy adopted by other tandem CH domains, like utrophin
and α-actinin, to fine-tune their stability and function by
modulating inter-CH-domain interactions.13−15,45 The full-length tandem CH domain of dystrophin is
stabilized because of the tethering of an unstable CH1 domain to a
stable CH2 domain and also due to N–C-terminal contact in a
closed conformation.38 A likely example
of the importance of inter-CH-domain interactions and N–C contact
in stabilizing tandem CH domains comes from utrophin, which, unlike
dystrophin, exists in an open conformation.39 Correspondingly, the utrophin tandem CH domain binds to F-actin
with a higher affinity than that of dystrophin.13,30 This leads to the hypothesis that the closed conformation provides
stability to the tandem CH domain at the expense of its actin-binding
function. Since the utrophin tandem CH domain exists in an open conformation,
deleting the N-terminal flanking region in utrophin caused lesser
stability changes (∼1.4 kcal/mol)16 compared to the dystrophin tandem CH domain (∼5 kcal/mol)
(Table 1) that exists
in a closed conformation.

The results obtained in this study agree with the above mentioned earlier
studies. The Dys-M tandem CH domain is more stable than those of Dys-P
and Dys-B (Figure 3 and Table 1) but
has a lesser affinity toward binding to F-actin (Figure 4). Lower stability of Dys-P
and Dys-B tandem CH domains could stem from decreased N–C contact
leading to more open conformation, which increases their actin-binding
affinity. Comparison of m-values in urea denaturation
profiles also showed lower m-values for tandem CH
domains of Dys-P and Dys-B (Table 1), suggesting a more open conformation for these isoforms
as compared to that of Dys-M. A similar inverse relationship between
the thermodynamic stability and actin-binding function has been observed
for tandem CH domains of utrophin,30,46 α-actinin,47 filamin,48 and spectrin.49 Many mutations that destabilize the tandem CH
domains have increased actin-binding affinity compared to their corresponding
wild-type proteins.

An inverse relationship between thermodynamic
stability and actin-binding
function of tandem CH domains can be quantitatively correlated only
when we can estimate the thermodynamic stability of the CH1 domain
in the tandem CH domain, since CH1 controls the actin-binding function
of tandem CH domains.13,14 Denaturant melts of tandem CH
domains, such as those in Figure 3A,B, should in principle be analyzed using a three-state
equation with an intermediate state where only the CH1 domain is unfolded
in between the native state (with both CH domains folded) and unfolded
state (with both CH domains unfolded).16,28 In such a
three-state analysis, the first transition corresponds to the unfolding
of the CH1 domain and the breaking of the CH1–CH2 interactions,
whereas the second transition corresponds to the unfolding of the
CH2 domain. In the case of the utrophin tandem CH domain, which exists
in an open conformation with minimal inter-CH-domain interactions,13,30,39,46 the difference in free energy of the first transition upon N-terminal
modifications was nearly the same as the change in actin-binding free
energy.16 Such analysis cannot be done
on the dystrophin tandem CH domain, which exists in a closed conformation
with significant inter-CH-domain interactions,13,30,38 because the first transition in the denaturant
melt corresponds to the sum of the stabilities of the CH1 domain and
the CH1–CH2 interactions that differ between the three isoforms
(see the Supporting Information).

Tissue-Specificity
of Tandem CH Domain–Actin Interactions
Dystrophin
tandem CH domain isoforms bind to smooth muscle actin
with a higher affinity than actin from other tissues. Actin from smooth
muscles is composed mostly of γ-smooth muscle actin (85%) and
β-actin (15%). Non-muscle actin is composed of β-actin
(85%) and γ-cytoactin (15%). Actin from other tissues is composed
of majorly α-actin. The results presented here indicate that
dystrophin isoforms are able to distinguish γ-smooth muscle
actin from other actin isoforms. Previous studies with the utrophin
tandem CH domain have shown that it can distinguish β-actin
from α-actin and binds more efficiently to β-actin.50 Similar studies showed a broader difference
between muscle and non-muscle actins binding to profilin,51 thymosin β4,52 ezrin,53 and plastin.54

In summary, the results obtained in this study suggest
that naturally occurring tandem CH domains of dystrophin isoforms
utilize minor sequence variations in their N-terminal flanking regions
to modulate their stability, actin-binding function, and tissue specificity
of actin–dystrophin interactions. Brain and Purkinje isoforms
have lesser stability compared to the muscle isoform. Stability and
actin-binding affinity follow an inverse correlation with less stable
brain and Purkinje isoforms binding with a higher affinity to actin.
Protein conformation, probably dictated by the N–C contact,
seems to play a major role in defining the stability and actin-binding
efficiency of tandem CH domains. Proteins in closed conformation have
higher stability and a lower affinity for actin, while proteins in
open conformation have lower stability and a higher affinity for actin.
In addition, tandem CH domains of dystrophin isoforms were also able
to distinguish smooth muscle actin from other isoforms of actin. This
differential interaction with actin isoforms could be useful in understanding
diverse symptoms of dystrophinopathies, which affect tissues other
than muscle and could help in designing therapeutics better suited
for such symptoms.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, Expression, and
Purification of Tandem CH Domains of
Dystrophin Isoforms
Genes encoding the tandem CH domains
of dystrophin isoforms (muscle, brain, and Purkinje) were synthesized
by Gene Universal and cloned into a pET-SUMO expression vector using BamH1 and Xho1 sites. The original pET-SUMO vector leaves
an additional serine residue at the N-terminus after the expressed
protein was cleaved with the Ulp1 protease55 and hence the codon corresponding to the serine residue was deleted
using site-directed mutagenesis. The cloned genes were transformed
into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The
sequence was confirmed after isolating the plasmid from the transformed
cells using a plasmid miniprep kit from Qiagen. The bacterial constructs
encoding the three proteins were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) media
at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a cell density
corresponding to OD600 nm of 0.5–0.8. All of
the three proteins were expressed in soluble fraction and purified
using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity column. The
N-terminal polyhistidine-SUMO tag was cleaved using Ulp1 protease
leaving no additional amino acids at the N-terminus, and pure proteins
were eluted from the Ni-NTA column in the flow-through. Pure proteins
were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M sodium phosphate,
0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.0). The homogeneity of the proteins was checked
using SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE.

Fluorescence and Circular
Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
The fluorescence spectra of tandem
CH domains of three dystrophin
isoforms in PBS were recorded at a concentration of 1 μM on
a Quantamaster, PTI fluorimeter. The samples were excited at 295 nm,
and the emission was recorded from 305 to 400 nm. CD spectra for the
three proteins were recorded at a concentration of 10 μM on
an Applied Photophysics Chirascan Plus spectrometer.

Urea Denaturation
Melts
Urea denaturation melts were
performed at a protein concentration of 1 μM using both CD and
fluorescence measurements. To obtain the Gibbs free energy of unfolding
in the absence of the denaturant (ΔG°unf) and the linear slope of the variation of Gibbs free energy
ΔGunf with denaturant concentration
(m-value), changes in ellipticity at 222 nm and fluorescence
emission at 320 nm (295 nm excitation) as a function of urea concentration
were fitted to a two-state equilibrium unfolding model,56 using the equation 1  where SD is the
measured signal as a function of denaturant concentration [D], SN and SU are the
intrinsic signals corresponding to the native and unfolded states
in the absence of the denaturant, mN and mU are the slopes of linear dependence of SN and SU on denaturant
concentration, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature in kelvin.

Midpoint
denaturant concentration, Cm, in the denaturant
melt was estimated by modifying the above eq 1 as 2  

Thermal Denaturation Melts
Temperature
denaturation
melts for tandem CH domains were recorded at a protein concentration
of 1 μM by monitoring the changes in ellipticity at 222 nm with
an increase in the solution temperature. The temperature ramp rate
was kept at 1 °C/min. To calculate the midpoint melting temperature
(Tm), data were fitted to a two-state
unfolding equation57,58 3  where ΔHm is the enthalpy change at Tm and ΔCp is the heat capacity change
between the native
and unfolded states. ΔCp was set
to zero for the calculation of Tm from
thermal melts, which simplifies the above equation to 4  

Since thermal melts of dystrophin tandem
CH domains are irreversible because of aggregation at higher temperatures,
only Tm values were considered for comparison
between the three isoforms.

Actin-Binding Assays
Actin from
different sources (skeletal
muscle, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and platelets) was purchased
from Cytoskeleton Inc. For obtaining binding curves, skeletal muscle
actin was polymerized in polymerization buffer (50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), and 10 mm Tris,
pH 7.5), and 7 μM was incubated with dystrophin tandem CH domains
ranging in concentration from 2 to 60 μM. The reaction mixture
was centrifuged at 100 000g for 25 min. Pellets
were resuspended in 30 μL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, 15 μL
of which was used for gel electrophoresis. Bands of actin and dystrophin
tandem CH domains were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250.
The amount of dystrophin bound to actin was calculated by measuring
the ratio of band intensities of dystrophin to actin using the Quantity
One software on Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR. The band intensities were corrected
for differential staining of proteins with Coomassie blue, as described
before.14,59 For determining the maximal number of binding
sites (Bmax) and the dissociation constant
(Kd), actin-binding assays were fit to
the equation 5  where y is the molar ratio
of the bound tandem CH domain to actin and x is the
unbound tandem CH domain concentration. The data fitted well with Bmax fixed to 1, as observed previously for dystrophin
tandem CH domains. For statistical analysis, 7 μM polymerized
actin from different sources was incubated at room temperature with
60 μM of tandem CH domains in a reaction volume of 100 μL.
The reaction mixture was processed as described above to obtain the
amount of dystrophin bound to actin. The data was presented as the
mean of at least five to seven independent experiments and was analyzed
by two-way ANOVA using the Origin Pro version 8 software to find the
statistical significance of the effect of two variables, actin tissue
source and dystrophin isoform, on actin–dystrophin binding
affinity. Tukey’s test was used for comparing the means of
individual groups.
