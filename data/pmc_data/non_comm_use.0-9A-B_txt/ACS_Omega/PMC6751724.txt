Gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) bound with biomolecules have emerged
as suitable biosensors exploiting unique surface chemistries and optical
properties. Many efforts have focused on antibody bioconjugation to
AuNPs resulting in a sensitive bioconjugate to detect specific types
of bacteria. Unfortunately, bacteria thrive under various harsh environments,
and an understanding of bioconjugate stability is needed. Here, we
show a method for optimizing Listeria monocytogenes polyclonal antibodies bioconjugation mechanisms to AuNPs via covalent
binding at different pH values, from 2 to 11, and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid, NaOH, HCl conditions. By fitting Lorentz curves to the amide
I and II regions, we analyze the stability of the antibody secondary
structure. This shows an increase in the apparent breakdown of the
antibody secondary structure during bioconjugation as pH decreases
from 7.9 to 2. We find variable adsorption efficiency, measured as
the percentage of antibody adsorbed to the AuNP surface, from 17 to
27% as pH increases from 2 to 6 before decreasing to 8 and 13% at
pH 7.9 and 11, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analysis reveals discrepancies between size and morphological changes
due to the corona layer assembly from antibody binding to single nanoparticles
versus aggregation or cluster self-assembly into large aggregates.
The corona layer formation size increases from 3.9 to 5.1 nm from
pH 2 to 6, at pH 7.9, there is incomplete corona formation, whereas
at pH 11, there is a corona layer formed of 6.4 nm. These results
indicate that the covalent binding process was more efficient at lower
pH values; however, aggregation and deactivation of the antibodies
were observed. We demonstrate that optimum bioconjugation condition
was determined at pH 6 and MES buffer-type by indicators of covalent
bonding and stability of the antibody secondary structure using Fourier
transform-infrared, the morphological characteristics and corona layer
formation using TEM, and low wavelength shifts of ultraviolet–visible
after bioconjugation.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent years, gold
nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugation has emerged
as a pivotal technique for the advanced detection of pathogens. AuNPs
have proven to be an ideal vessel for bioconjugation and biosensor
purposes due to their unique surface characteristics, optical properties,
stability, and consistency.1−5 Using surface modification techniques, many types of molecules such
as peptides, oligonucleotides, enzymes, DNA, and antibodies can be
attached to AuNPs through physisorption or chemisorption.6−8 From these molecules, antibodies have emerged as an ideal targeting
mechanism for antigen-specific pathogen detection due to their increasing
availability, quality, and specificity.9

To utilize antibodies in biosensors and sensing devices, favorable
substrate interactions must be developed.10 Antibody molecules can be attached to the surface-functionalized
AuNP via chemisorption, targeting various functionalities, such as
cysteine or amine groups, or electrostatic interactions, utilizing
ionic or hydrophobic interactions.2,11 The antibody-bound
AuNPs must be stable under a broad range of wet chemistry conditions
(e.g., pH, salt concentration, and type, or temperature); therefore,
a covalent bond is preferred.10,12 Currently, two major
covalent bioconjugation strategies are being investigated. Targeted
immobilization through terminal thiols creates consistent stable Au–S
bonds and has been shown to facilitate stable structural chemisorption
of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and tunable orientation via pH manipulation.11,13 In direct competition, robust amide bonds through pegylated carboxyl
groups around AuNPs have provided oriented functionalization with
heightened functional site accessibility.14

This type of covalent bonding is regularly established via
carbodiimide
crosslinker chemistry using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride–N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS).6,15 Previously, this method has been used to effectively bind primary
amines on antibodies onto carboxyl end-functionalized AuNPs.2 However, all antibodies have multiple primary
amine binding sites largely originating from lysine residues.14,16 Primary amines on an antibody molecule serve as the recognition
sites that can detect and bind to antigens. The range of orientations
and packing densities resulted from EDC/NHS crosslinking of nanoparticles
to antibodies at the primary amine termini could potentially result
in antibodies with compromised binding to their target antigens.17 Despite tangible drawbacks, such as undesired
antibodies orientation, EDC/NHS binding has the distinct advantage
of providing a stable and consistent covalent bond. Several studies
have optimized the wet chemistry conditions to favor antibody orientation
when bound to a surface.13,14,18 For instance, previous research on two-dimensional substrates suggests
that the wet conditions, such as pH, ionic concentration, and buffer-type,
influence the antibody orientation and binding capacity.19 For sensitive detection using AuNPs coupled
with antibodies, it is necessary to optimize the antibody AuNP bioconjugation
process to maintain stability and provide a functional orientation
of the antibodies on the nanoparticle surface.

Bioconjugation
conditions between the biomolecule and nanoparticles
via covalent bonding must be consistent, predictable, and stable for
quality AuNP–antibody interactions. To achieve binding with
optimum antibody orientation, the solvent conditions such as buffer-type,
pH, and ionic concentration play a critical role. As an example, when
using buffer solutions, the structural integrity of the polyclonal
antibodies (pAb) must be maintained as it can greatly affect EDC/NHS
carbodiimide crosslinker reactions. Noncoordinating zwitterionic buffers
are ideal selections for maintaining a stable environment about the
particle and avoid coordination with the AuNPs.20 The buffer pH will then play a significant role in changing
the surface charge effects of the AuNPs and, subsequently, the rate
and quality of the binding reaction.21,22 This change
in the surface charge can be monitored via ζ-potential probing
over the pH range.23 After covalent bioconjugation,
an inherent increase in ζ-potential is expected from the utilized
pAb containing a less negative charge, which is an indicator of successful
corona layer assembly.24

To understand
the complex interactions during the antibody corona
formation, analyzing the specific type of adsorption mechanisms of
the biomolecules to the nanoparticles is fundamental.25,26 It is expected that following binding, average particle size will
increase due to aggregation for several reasons. First, the natural
interaction of cysteine with metal nanoparticles causes dissolution.27 Second, portions of the protein unfold upon
bioconjugation and due to pH changes. This unfolding allows the proteins
to interact, which induces the aggregation of particles via protein
interaction.11,28−30 Using spectroscopic
techniques, such as the highly active ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra produced by AuNPs at
different binding stages, the interactions between the biomolecules
and the AuNP surface can be precisely described. Particularly, FT-IR
allows for descriptions of pAb–AuNP complex interactions in
the corona layer assemblies.31,32 This technique allows
the analysis of the stability changes in the secondary structure of
the biomolecule.33−36 Hence, specific information on the structural effects of pAb–AuNPs
interactions at specific solvent conditions can be obtained. Simultaneously,
UV–vis is useful to provide insights to the kinetics and the
stability of the pAb-coated AuNPs.37,38

In this
study, we determine the balance between efficiency and
stability of the bound antibody, as a function of solvent pH (pH 2–11)
and buffer-type, to carboxyl-functionalized AuNPs using EDC/NHS chemistry.
Carboxyl end-functionalized AuNPs were bioconjugated to Listeria monocytogenes targeting polyclonal immunoglobulin
G class antibodies (pAb) under different wet chemistry conditions.
To determine optimal pH and buffer conditions for the L. monocytogenes pAb–AuNP bioconjugation,
the balance between stability and binding capacity of the AuNPs was
assessed by analyzing kinetic measurements during the covalent binding
of the pAb to the AuNP. This analysis is done by conducting time-dependent
hydrodynamic diameter, UV absorbance, and ζ-potential measurements
during the adsorption process. Then, by utilizing infrared spectroscopic
analysis, a description of the potential conformational and secondary
structure changes to the pAb upon the formation of the pAb–AuNP
complex over the tested pH and buffer conditions is presented. Finally,
the self-assembly and the effects of the adsorption process on the
morphological characteristics of pAb–AuNP conjugates are analyzed
and discussed by observing the corona layer formation through TEM
imaging.

Materials and Methods
Materials
N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-carbodiimide (EDC, 97%), N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS, 98%), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid
(MOPS, 99.5%), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid
sodium salt (99.5%), 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES, 99.5%), 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid sodium salt (99%), hydroxylamine 50 weight % in H2O, isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Hydrochloric Acid, 10% v/v aqueous solution (HCl),
was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Gold nanospheres (40
nm, BioReady, carboxyl, 20 OD, 5 mL, water) were obtained from NanoComposix
(San Diego, CA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against L. monocytogenes (PIPA130487) was purchased from
Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. All reagents
were used as received. Ultrapure type-1 water (18 MΩ cm) was
acquired from an Elga PURELAB purification system and was used for
all buffer preparations. Thermo Scientific Pierce 96-Well Plates,
Product No. 15041 was used for bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Bovine
serum albumin (BSA) standard kit was purchased from Thermo Fisher
catalog #23225.

AuNPs Carbodiimide Crosslinking Procedure
Carboxylated
gold nanoparticles (40 nm, COOH–AuNPs) were used for their
consistent optical extinction peak at 525 nm prior to bioconjugation.39 Solutions of EDC and NHS were prepared at 2
and 10 mg/mL, respectively, using water. Carboxylated gold nanoparticles
(200 μL of 40 nm, COOH–AuNPs) were added to CCPO microcentrifuge
tubes, which were previously washed with isopropyl alcohol and deionized
(DI) water. Desired buffer solution (1 mL) was added to the 200 μL
of carboxylated gold nanoparticles to begin pH control. EDC (40 μg),
20 μL of 2 mg/mL of the solution, was added to 1.2 mL of AuNP
solution. This solution was vortexed at 1000 RPM at room temperature
for 10 min. NHS (80 μg), 8 μL of 10 mg/mL of the solution,
was added to the EDC/AuNPs solution. The solution was vortexed at
1000 RPM at room temperature for 10 min followed by centrifugation
at 15 000 RCF for 10 min at 10 °C. The supernatant was
carefully removed, and the remaining pellet was resuspended with 200
μL of the respective buffer prepared at the desired pH value.
Resuspension was performed by sonicating the solution for 5 min and
vortex mixing for 5 min at 1000 RPM. This washing procedure was repeated
twice followed by off-line dynamic light scattering (DLS) runs using
20 μL of the suspension in 1.5 mL of DI water. The remaining
nanoparticle suspension was diluted with 1 mL of the buffer solution
and placed in a 2 mL microcuvette in the UV–vis analyzer. Antibody
solution (8 μL of 1 mg/mL) was then added to the AuNP colloidal
suspension for a minimum of 90 min or until the time-resolved UV–vis
spectra no longer experienced peak changes, reaching adsorption equilibrium.
The solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and
retained to test the antibody adsorption efficiency using UV–vis
measurements, as described in the next section. The AuNP pellet was
resuspended in 200 μL of DI water, and 1 μL of the quencher
(50% hydroxylamine) was added to the solution. The solution was then
split into two 100 μL samples, centrifuged at 15 000
RCF for 10 min at 10 °C, and resuspended in different solvents.
One sample was resuspended with DI water, whereas the other was resuspended
with the reaction pH buffer. This washing step was performed three
times. pAb binding via noncarbodiimide crosslinking was performed
identically to the reaction above excluding the EDC/NHS chemistry
steps as a control experiment to assess electrostatic interactions.

BCA Protein Assay
Triplicates of BSA standards were
prepared at 0, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 μg/mL. Weight ratios of
50 parts of BCA reagent A with 1 part of BCA reagent B were mixed
for immediate use. To a 96-well plate, 25 μL of each standard
and each tested condition was added followed by 200 μL of the
mixed BCA reagent. The plate was covered and incubated for 55 min
at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 562 nm both prior to and
after incubation to ensure that results were not skewed due to leftover
particles in the supernatant.

Ultraviolet–visible
Spectroscopy (UV–vis)
Ultraviolet–visible spectra
of the prepared AuNPs were measured
with a Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIP spectrometer in the range of 300–1000
nm. A polystyrene 2 mL semimicrocuvette was used to hold 1.2 mL and
to record the spectra. An initial spectrum was taken of the AuNPs
in each of the reaction solvents. Data acquisition was run continuously,
whereas the pAb reaction was occurring after the EDC/NHS crosslinking
steps. Data was taken every 5 min for 90 min or until a UV absorbance
of 0 was recorded at the 525 or 585 nm wavelength. To analyze the
degree of aggregation, the aggregation index (AI) eq 1 was used 1  with A525 being
the peak absorption value at 525 nm and A585 being the peak absorption value at 585 nm. Values greater than 1
were considered aggregated.24

Additional
UV–vis measurements were used to determine the concentration
of unbounded antibody remaining in the supernatant via the BCA protein
assay method. This equation is shown in the Supporting Information, eq S1.

The pAb binding efficiency was then
calculated using eq 2 2  where pAbo is the initial concentration
of the antibody added to the solution and pAb is the concentration
found via the calibration curves from the supernatant after three
washes. The calibration curves were developed by taking the absorbance
reading at 562 nm and fitting linear regression of absorption in AU
vs the concentration for diluted BSA standards was used in this study.

After determining the binding efficiency, final UV–vis curves
were taken to determine the wavelength at the maximum absorbance in
arbitrary units. This wavelength is reported as the localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR).

Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectrometry (FT-IR)
FT-IR
was measured by a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer using an attenuated
total reflection (ATR) attachment (Smart Golden Gate, ZnSe lens, Thermo
Electron North America LLC). A minimum of 128 scans was collected,
with the background spectrum collected after each sample. A liquid
nitrogen-cooled (MCT-A) detector with a CdTe window ZnSe crystal was
utilized, and data was gathered using the OMNIC Software Suite v7.3.
COOH–AuNPs, pAb–AuNPs, and pAb samples of 10 μLs
were placed directly onto the ATR crystal and allowed to dry for approximately
40 min until a thin film remained. The reference spectrum for each
sample was taken under identical conditions after the crystal was
cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. Second derivative spectra and Lorentz
curves were generated using OriginPro v.9.1 by subtraction of the
water spectra such that a straight baseline was obtained between 2000
and 1750 cm–1.40,41 Following
this procedure, a Lorentz fitting of the amide I and amide II regions
for each sample was obtained with the Lorentzian band A(v) expressed as eq 3 3  where Ao is the
maximum absorbance of the individual Lorentz peak, vo is the frequency of the maximum, and v is the half-width at half height of the individual Lorentz peak.
Multiple Lorentz peaks were summed to fit each curve peak as closely
as possible. Following fitting, the second derivative is assigned.
Taking the second derivative of each curve allows for more sensitive
detection of influential peaks. All peak assignments were performed
in the OriginPro 9.1 software.

To analyze binding effects at
each pH condition using FT-IR spectra, it is critical to adjust for
water in this region (1640 cm–1). The water spectra
are collected under identical methodology as the pAb–AuNP samples
and are used to subtract from the pAb–AuNP spectra to minimize
1750–2000 cm–1 wavenumber region.40,41 Following this procedure, a Lorentz curve fitting is performed on
the resulting spectra. Lorentz peak locations are assigned by adding
peaks listed in Table 1 iteratively to find optimal fitting parameters, where optimization
is determined by obtaining an R-squared value close to 1 (Figure 4). The second derivative
of each of the fitted curves is then taken to compare the peak location
and determine the most influential peaks by relative size.

ζ-Potential
Measurements
Average ζ-potential
was measured using an Anton Paar Litesizer 500 instrument with a minimum
of 200 and a maximum of 600 runs until a standard deviation of less
than 0.1 mV was achieved at 25 °C. Samples of 200 μL:1
mL dilution, placed in a folded capillary ζ-cell were acquired
from Anton Paar. A control sample, using the COOH–AuNPs in
each of the reaction solutions, was taken along with control points
using 0.5 pH value increments of the reaction buffers within their
usable range to fill the ζ-potential curve. Additionally, the ζ-potential
was taken of the particles after pAb bioconjugation diluted with ultrapure
type-1 water, MOPs buffer adjusted to a pH of 7, NaOH adjusted to
a pH of 11, and HCl adjusted to a pH of 3.

Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)
The intensity, effective,
and number diameters of the AuNPs were measured using a NanoBrook
90Plus with a red (640 nm) laser and a 90° scattering angle.
A quartz cuvette was used for all measurements. For each sample, five
DLS measurements were conducted with 10 repetitions for each measurement,
and average results are reported. The off-line DLS samples were prepared
as a 1:20 dilution by volume from the prepared solution with DI water.
DLS was collected before each bioconjugation, before the addition
of the antibody to the solution, and after the completion of bioconjugation
for each buffer pH condition studied.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) Images
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected with a Hitachi H-7600
TEM instrument at 100 kV. CF300-copper grids and Fontax #16 tweezers
obtained from Electron Microscope Sciences were washed in IPA immediately
prior to use. A nanoparticle colloid (5 μL) was added to a copper
carbon mesh grid followed by 3 μL of IPA to break the surface
tension. The tweezers, holding the grid, were then placed in a vacuum
chamber for 15 min. The sample was then removed from the chamber and
allowed to dry for an additional 30 min at room temperature before
use in the TEM. The analysis of the particle and corona layer size
was performed using the ImageJ analyze particle function.

Results
and Discussion
Time-Dependent Studies of Polyclonal Antibody
(pAb), Gold Nanoparticle
(AuNP) Structures
UV–vis, DLS, and ζ-potential
are used to assess the in situ condition of the pAb in the solution
and the effects of the pAb–AuNP formation at each pH condition
(HCl-2, MES-4.5, MES-6, MOPs-7.9, NaOH-11) performed in this study.
The COOH–AuNPs are used as a control study at each pH condition.
An increase in the aggregation index (AI) as compared to the COOH–AuNPs
measured during the final UV–vis spectrum for each pAb binding
onto AuNPs at the respective pH condition reveals a decrease in stability
(Figure S1). AI is indicative of the aggregate
formation or primary particles forming crystalline structures and
fusing together.42

At a pH 2 condition,
a peak wavelength increase of over 100 nm, paired with an AI above
1, suggests complete aggregation. The MES-4.5 and MES-6 conditions
saw the lowest peak wavelength shifts of 12.5 ± 2.5 and 10 ±
2.5 nm, respectively, which is within the previously reported shift
increase for bioconjugation with AuNPs.39,43,44 The pAb–AuNP MOPs-7.9 exhibited minimal changes
in UV–vis spectra with respect to the COOH–AuNPs, as
observed in Figure 1. A higher wavelength increase is observed at NaOH-11 condition with
a 17.5 ± 2 nm redshift. This result is slightly above the expected
wavelength increase for the formation of pAb–AuNP43 and is an indication of aggregation.24,39 Also, the aggregation is confirmed with the AI nearing 1 for the
NaOH-11 condition and the broad nature of the UV–vis spectra,
which is attributed to the linear aggregation due to dipole interactions.45

Figure 1 UV–vis spectra for resulting pAb–AuNP structures
at each bioconjugation procedure.

After antibody bioconjugation, DLS for each pAb–AuNP showed
an increase in diameter due to the antibody bioconjugation and surface
passivation. The maximum expected increase from a fully developed
corona of the antibody on its longest axis is ∼30 nm from DLS
assuming that no other effects are present, as reported elsewhere.46 At all pH values, larger variations in the particle
size are observed for the pAb–AuNP bioconjugates. This discrepancy
is likely indicative of the formation of large combined particles
through weak physical interactions such as aggregation and agglomeration.42,47,48 Additionally, the use of pAbs
has a primary disadvantage of cross-reactivity between the monoclonal
antibodies within the total immunoglobulin system.

When the
corona layer does not achieve full coverage of the COOH–AuNPs,
dimers and trimers are likely to form to create stable intermediates
due to dipole interactions as asymmetric distributions of charges
form. Additionally, adsorption of antibodies into the corona layer
without targeted covalent binding but via electrostatic interactions
or binding through cysteine groups can cause sensitivity of the particle
to solution conditions resulting in instability of reactive moieties
and decreased antigen-binding capacity.49 This undesirable binding can occur largely due to the net charge
dominating early interactions between proteins and AuNPs in situ.50 Each of the tested conditions increases in the
diameter size more than 30 nm, a result regularly seen during the
formation of pAb–AuNP nanoprobes.44,51 This is a primary disadvantage to this type of the bioconjugation
method as crosslinking of the carbodiimide bridge can attribute to
the increase in the particle size.17 The
DLS diameters by number match the ζ-potential changes (Figures 2 and S2, S3), with the highest Δζ-potential
values corresponding to the largest size increase. The exception occurs
at the NaOH-11 condition, which maintains the lowest diameter after
the bioconjugation procedure. The discrepancies between the number,
effective, and intensity diameters are indicative of each condition
experiencing a few large aggregates.46

Figure 2 (A) DLS
by intensity, number, and the effective diameter of pAb–AuNPs
demonstrates an increase in the particle size after each bioconjugation
procedure while suspended in water. (B) ζ-Potential of pAb–AuNPs
after bioconjugation is performed suspended in pH 3, pH 7, and pH
10 solutions.

The pAb–AuNPs show a stronger
resiliency or ability to hold
various ζ-potential charges to stabilize electrostatic interactions
at broader pH ranges after binding. This is suggested by positive
ζ-potentials at the low pH conditions for each of the prepared
pAb–AuNP excluding MOPs-7.9. Furthermore, a drastic pH dependence
is shown by the MES-4.5, MES-6, and NaOH conditions, while matching
the ζ-potential of the pAb at the neutral pH 7 condition.52 Antibody corona formation resulted in a net
increase in ζ-potential from all pH bioconjugation values when
compared to the COOH–AuNPs (Figures S4 and S5), confirming at minimum, partial adsorption of antibody
at each condition.53 When the pAb–AuNPs
are tested at pH 3, a positive ζ-potential is observed, whereas
all other bioconjugation pH values maintain negative values with varied
pH increase. As the particles are coated with proteins, the ζ-potential
becomes more stable at lower pH values by acting as buffer coatings
with positive ζ-potential at pH below the protein isoelectric
point (pI).52 Denaturing of the secondary
structure is likely to occur at low pH values allowing for epitope
interactions between the proteins.30 Hence,
the positive ζ-potential value is not a perfect indicator for
pAb–AuNP stability.54

Following
bioconjugation, ζ-potential changes with respect
to COOH–AuNPs at the neutral pH 7 condition see a net increase
in charge: ΔζHCl-2 = 9.71 ± 1.6,
ΔζMES-4.5 = 17.4 ± 0.4, ΔζMES-6 = 17.01 ± 1.3, ΔζMOPs-7.9 = 4.08 ± 0.5, and ΔζNaOH-11 =
18.06 ± 0.43 (Figures 2B and S3). Differences in the changes
are likely due to a mixture of packing density bonding and orientation
of the antibody. As the packing density increases, the diffuse layer
increases in size resulting in diffusion limitation of the positively
charged ions. After adsorption of the pAb, the large negative charge
of the carboxyl groups is no longer able to assist in decreasing the
ζ-potential of the particles. Finally, after covalent bonding,
the positive charges of the lysine residues on the pAbs will attract
negative ions. Depending on the orientation of the binding and, subsequently,
the amount of residues oriented away from the particle, the ζ-potential
increases.43 The slipping plane will experience
a larger positive shift when the F(ab′)2 regions
are oriented away from the particle or when the particle is in the
face-on configuration. Based on these results, the MES-4.5, MES-6,
and NaOH-11 conditions maintain the most ideal ζ-potential increase.

Chemical Characterization of pAb–AuNP Structures
Neat COOH–AuNP, pAb at each pH condition and in water, the
pAb–AuNP synthesized at each pH condition, and pAb–AuNP
synthesized without the addition of EDC/NHS chemistry steps are characterized
using attenuated total reflection (ATR) FT-IR to analyze the chemical
changes after bioconjugation (Figure 3). Primary indicators for carbodiimide-initiated covalent
bonding will be peak formations in the amide regions across the FT-IR
spectrum. Specifically, the formation of a sharp peak in the amide
A region, near 3300 cm–1, and an increase in the
peak height in the amide II regions are strong indicators of covalent
bonding.55,56 The formation of this peak is expected for
an amide bond during the crosslinking resulting in an N–H stretch.57 Additionally, the complex nature of the side
chains of proteins containing many types of amide and amine bonds
requires many newly formed amide bonds must be present to create a
sharp peak atop the wide protein curves between 3000 and 3750 cm–1.57,58 This type of wide peak is seen
in the amide A region of the neat pAb (Figure 3A) and at all pH conditions excluding the
NaOH-11 condition (Figures S6 and S7).
The neat pAb spectrum shows notable absorption peaks at 1044, 1117,
1185, and 1455 cm–1 in the fingerprint and amide
III regions as well as a peak at 1638 cm–1 and a
shoulder at 1554 cm–1 in the amide I and II regions,
respectively.

The AuNP has similar absorption peaks in this wavenumber
region.
Specific peaks for the AuNPs are observed at 1051, 1110, 1191, 1403,
1464, and 1643 cm–1. A complete peak assignment
to both the neat pAb and AuNPs is listed in Table S1.32,59−61 The pH and
buffer conditions used during bioconjugation influence the fingerprint
region causing broadening and peak shifts by affecting the adsorption
of the pAb to the COOH–AuNP. Due to the large amount of absorption
peak overlap between the pAb and COOH–AuNP, a more detailed
analysis of the peak assignment is needed to understand conformational
changes of the antibodies after binding onto the AuNPs surface. The
amide A region of the full FT-IR spectrum suggests that both the MES-4.5
and MES-6 conditions caused the formation of the carbodiimide bridge
and, thus, covalent bonding between the pAb and COOH–AuNP (Figure 3D–E). This
shows a notch at ∼3300 cm–1 associated with
N–H stretching from the formation of a secondary amine during
binding via Schiff base reduction, a reaction which is highly dependent
on pH as well as the peak increase in the amide II band expected of
binding.57

Comparing these peaks
to the pAb tested at each respective pH condition,
major peak changes occur throughout the FT-IR spectra at each pAb–AuNP
condition excluding the MOPs-7.9 condition (Figure S6). For further comparison to ensure that peak changes are
a resultant of the carbodiimide crosslinking, each pAb–AuNP
condition was tested with the absence of EDC/NHS (Figure S7). These spectra contain peak wavenumber differences
for each spectrum in the amide II and fingerprint regions, excluding
the MOPs-7.9 condition. Furthermore, the MES-4.5 and MES-6 conditions
lack a sharp peak in the amide A region, which is present in the carbodiimide
crosslinker pAb–AuNPs. Strengthening the claim that covalent
bonding or at a minimum successful formation of the carbodiimide crosslinker
has occurred.

The secondary structures of proteins, such as
α-helix, β-sheets,
turns, and unordered structures, can be described by deconstruction
of the additive curves in the amide I and II regions.62 Specific stretching and bending of the peptide backbone
in amide I, II, and III bands have proven an effective technique for
describing changes in these structures.63 The amide I band has become the most consistent, widely used region
for conformational changes, whereas the amide II band can describe
hydrogen exchanges and relative amounts of adsorbed protein.34,64 Specific wavenumber assignments in the amide I region (1600–1720
cm–1) have been shown to be descriptors for protein
conformations (Table 1).41

Once each sample is adjusted
for the influence of water, the resulting
spectra for each of the pAb–AuNP assembly conditions are compared
to the neat pAb, the pAb at their respective pH condition, the COOH–AuNP
and the pAb–AuNPs conjugated without the EDC/NHS chemistry
steps. The carboxyl-functionalized groups surrounding the AuNPs influence
the curves as the amide I band corresponds with all C=O bonds
and, as such, the definition of the changes in the pAb structure will
be muddled. There are three peaks assigned in the amide I region (1600–1700
cm–1) shown with Lorentz fitting of the neat antibody
(Figure S8A). The 1641 and 1623 cm–1 peaks are assigned to β-sheet secondary structures,
whereas the 1666 cm–1 peak is assigned to the β-turns
of the secondary structure. In the nonsmoothed curve, there is a slight
shoulder near the 1651 cm–1 mark, which is likely
the low amount of α-helix contained in the pAb structure.31 This is in agreement with literature values
as the majority (>60%) of the pAb is β-sheets.55 In the amide II region, there is a single peak
at 1543
cm–1 (N–H), representative of a primary amine
deformation.57

Each of these peaks
is in direct competition with one of the pAb
peaks. This can cause interference in analyzing the Lorentz curves.
The second derivative of the final curve allows for a method of increased
sensitivity for peak locations and acts as a convolution indicator
for overlapping peaks.65 As such, the two
curves are used in tandem for each bioconjugation condition to describe
pAb binding and structural changes. The pAb–AuNP conjugated
at a HCl-2 pH condition fit five peaks at 1673, 1659, 1636, 1602,
and 1550 cm–1 (Figure 4A). These peaks correspond
to the presence of β-sheet, random coil, turns, and, to a lesser
extent, α-helix. Overall these peaks suggest the presence of
pAb; however, the peak shifts also suggest that the pAb may have denatured.66 As a result, an over-representation of random
coil/β-turn type curves is observed that is unique to the carbodiimide
crosslinking adsorption of the HCl-2 condition, as these peak assignments
are not seen in the pAb or the pAb–AuNPs test without EDC/NHS
at the HCl-2 condition (Figures S9 and S10).

Figure 4 Lorentz fit and the second derivative for the amide I and II region
of: (A) HCl-2, (B) MES-4.5, (C) MES-6, (D) MOPs-7.9, (E) NaOH-11.

At a slightly higher pH, MES-4.5 condition, improved
pAb binding
conditions are determined (Figure 4B). The amide I band peaks are observed at 1679, 1660,
and 1640 cm–1. These peaks are assigned to β-sheets,
β-turns or random coils, and β-sheets or the carboxyl
group on the COOH–AuNP, respectively. Interestingly, results
suggest the presence of both uncoated COOH–AuNP and pAb. Like
the HCl-2 pAb–AuNP, there is an over-representation of β-turns
or random coils suggesting that the pAb may have denatured. These
structural changes are unique to the MES-4.5 pAb–AuNPs carbodiimide
binding, as shown by the pAb and pAb–AuNPs tested without EDC/NHS
(Figures S11 and S12). Conversely, the
amide II region contains a sharp relative peak increase of the primary
amine at 1543 cm–1, which directly matches the peak
value found for the neat pAb. The direct peak value match may be indicative
of consistent and more uniform stretching of this portion of the pAb
structure.56 Furthermore, consistent stretching
would suggest that binding of similar lysine groups on the pAb has
occurred, possibly giving the pAb consistent orientation if the pAb
electrostatically absorbed prior to the covalent bonding. This is
shown to have a higher likelihood of occurring, though is not guaranteed,
at lower pH values.19,64,67

pAb–AuNP bioconjugates at the MES-6 pH condition have
amide
I peaks at 1681, 1663, 1646 cm–1 with an additional
peak at 1630 cm–1 (Figure 4C). The MES-6 pAb–AuNP also contains
the amide II curve at 1541 cm–1 suggesting the presence
of pAb with minimal traces of COOH–AuNPs an indicator of carboxyl
group coverage. The lack of increase in the β-turns or random
coils in the second derivative indicated stability in the pAb, which
is not seen in MES-4.5 or HCl-2 pAb–AuNPs. Furthermore, these
structural changes are not seen in the pAb alone or the pAb–AuNPs
conjugated without EDC/NHS, a strong indicator that these results
are unique to the carbodiimide crosslinking at the MES-6 condition
(Figures S13 and S14). Bonding multiple
lysine groups in different locations will cause a wide peak as the
stretching of each group will carry different wavenumber frequencies.64 As a result, the broad amide I peak for the
MES-6 bioconjugation suggests multiple structural formations and binding
orientations. The lack of consistent binding orientation is further
supported by the broad shoulder of the 1541 cm–1 peak, an indicator of lower selectivity.68

Both the amide I and amide II bands for the pAb–AuNP
bioconjugate
at the MOPs-7.9 condition show Lorentz fits and second derivatives
like those seen for the untreated AuNP with peaks at 1738, 1674, 1646,
and 1568 cm–1 (Figure 4D). This result suggests that there is little
to no pAb present, which is supported by the lack of change seen in
the final UV–vis spectra (Figure 1) as well as the similarities in the amide
A bands and fingerprint regions of the full spectra. Additionally,
pAb alone and pAb–AuNPs tested without EDC/NHS show drastically
different Lorentz peak locations (Figures S15 and S16).

At the most basic solution condition, the NaOH-11,
the pAb–AuNPs
held four peaks at 1673, 1642, 1612, and 1547 cm–1 (Figure 4E). The
assignment of these peaks is comparable to pAb, with the second derivative
having three major peaks in the amide I region. The peaks are noticeably
broader and have been shifted slightly; however, there is not enough
evidence that covalent binding has occurred. Rather the basic pH value
caused the pAb to physically adsorb to the surface in a noncovalent
manner to cover the negative charge of the carboxyl groups around
the surface of the AuNP.17 This relies
on the pH value being high enough to overcome the negative repulsion
of the particles shown by ζ-potential (Figure 2B). The shifted values are also in line with
the curve fitting data from the literature of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-type
antibodies adsorbed onto silica surfaces.41 Furthermore, similar peak locations are seen in the pAb–AuNP
NaOH-11 condition tested without the EDC/NHS chemistry steps (Figures S17 and S18).

For FT-IR analysis,
the MES-4.5 and MES-6 conditions display the
strongest characteristics for pAb–AuNP bioconjugation. The
MES-4.5 condition suggests that pH and buffer selection can affect
the ability to consistently bind lysine residues on the pAb. In this
instance, selectivity causes slight destabilization of the secondary
structure, indicated by an over-representation of β-turns or
random coil peaks. The MES-6 condition provides indicators of secondary
structure stability while maintaining peak locations consistent with
the covalent bond formation for the pAb–AuNP.

Time-Dependent
Antibody Binding Analysis of pAb–AuNPs
Each of the
time-dependent UV–vis spectra is taken after
completing EDC/NHS crosslinker chemistry. After placing the treated
nanoparticles at the respective solution condition, both the HCl-2
and NaOH-11 are partially aggregated prior the antibody binding step,
as seen in the DLS measurement of the EDC/NHS step before pAb addition
(Figure S19). Furthermore, aggregation
is present prior to the crosslinker chemistry steps in the HCl-2 condition,
apparent by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength
initiating at greater than 600 nm as well as the initial DLS (Figures 5A and S2).24 This cannot
be attributed to the chemistry step but rather to aggregation caused
by electrostatic interactions induced by the low pH value.69

The initial addition of pAb to the EDC/NHS-modified
COOH–AuNP induced complete aggregation in the MES-6 condition
shown by the LSPR absorbance reaching 0 after 95 min and the LSPR
maximum wavelength maintaining at greater than 600 nm (Figure 5B). Partial aggregation in the MES-4.5 condition shown by
the LSPR maximum wavelength maintaining at greater than 600 nm (Figure 5C). The time-dependent
UV–vis spectra can be used to check for dispersion or maintaining
particles in the solution without mixing, by having a final time-resolved
absorbance greater than zero.70 Aggregation
and agglomeration characteristics among these samples are in direct
competition with the covalent binding characteristics of the desired
reaction and adsorption of antibodies to the surface of the particles.

shift (red, nm) of: (A) HCl-2, (B) MES-4.5, (C) MES-6, (D) MOPs-7.9,
(E) NaOH-11.

The pAb–AuNP LSPR peak
absorbance has red-shifted compared
to the COOH–AuNP at all pH conditions except MOPs-7.9, where
minimal changes in UV–vis spectra are observed. The NaOH-11
condition does not see a change in the peak wavelength over time after
the shift from the EDC/NHS chemistry step (Figure 5D). The HCl-2, MES-4.5, MES-6 conditions
have indicators of time-dependent adsorption, described by the peak
wavelength shift of over 20 nm. The plateau of peak wavelength shifts
is indicative of maximum packing for each condition, which is less
effective at binding antigens due to steric hindrance of the pAb.5,18 As such, time-dependent studies can be used to estimate the packing
density of the pAb–AuNP moving forward.

Morphological Characterization
of pAb–AuNP Bioconjugates
Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images show an increase
in the corona layer assembly size for each pAb bioconjugation condition
(Figures 6 and S20). The COOH–AuNPs (Figure 6A) are 42 ± 2 nm in diameter.
The HCl-2 condition (Figure 6B) is determined to be 50 ± 5 nm, with signs of aggregation,
agglomeration, and protein denaturation.1,71−73 The average corona layer size is 3.9 ± 2 nm, which suggests
either denaturation of pAb, side-on or face-on orientation. The MES-4.5
(Figure 6C) and MES-6
(Figure 6D) buffer
bioconjugation conditions are 56 ± 5 nm, and 51 ± 4 nm,
respectively. Each shows indications of the stable pAb corona layer
assembly with slight aggregation. The corona layer thicknesses for
MES-4.5 and MES-6 buffer bioconjugation are 4.6 ± 1 and 5.1 ±
1 nm, respectively. Size increases are within the desired corona size
(3–6 nm), which suggests that either side-on or face-on orientation
is achieved. The 3–6 nm region is the ideal size change as
flat-on and end-on orientations are the desired directional conformation,
as the average value for the conjugate, part of which is not covered
by pAb.5,17 The MOPs-7.9 (Figure 6E) bioconjugation condition has a diameter
of 45 ± 4 nm with few signs of corona layer assembly and aggregation
occurring. The MOPs-7.9 bioconjugation has negligible corona layer
measured as 0.4 ± 0.3 nm. This result suggests low levels of
binding, corroborated by the low pAb efficiency described in Figure S2. The NaOH-11 condition is determined
to be 52 ± 4 nm with signs of aggregation and agglomeration.
This condition maintains a corona layer of 6.4 ± 2 nm slightly
outside of the desired corona size. The discrepancies between the
corona layer size found and the DLS size (Figure 2A) are likely due to the pAb–AuNPs
displaying a tendency to agglomerate in the aqueous solution due to
protein interaction.30,74

Figure 6 TEM scale length corresponds to 40 nm
in length images of: (A)
Neat COOH–AuNPs, (B)
pAb–AuNPs HCl-2, (C) pAb–AuNPs MES-4.5, (D) pAb–AuNPs
MES-6, (E) pAb–AuNPs MOPs-7.9, (F) pAb–AuNPs NaOH-11.

pAb adsorption efficiency (Figures S21 and S22) is determined via BCA protein assay’s calibrated
by optical density curves for the concentration of pAb remaining in
the supernatant. The HCl-2 condition results in an adsorption efficiency
of 17%. This directly correlates to the expected increase in the corona
layer size (Figure S8) compared to the
MES-4.5 and MES-6 conditions. It is expected that the corona layer
size would be directly and positively correlated to the antibody efficiency.
For the HCl-2 condition, this contradiction may be due to the breakdown
and aggregation of the pAb structure or unfavorable orientation of
the pAb (Figure 6B).
The MES-4.5 and MES-6 conditions are found to have the highest efficiencies
at 28 and 27%, respectively, these values are relatively close and
appear to corroborate the corona layer size previously discussed and
shown in Figure S4. The MOPs-7.9 condition
maintained a 7% efficiency, which corresponds to the low corona layer
formation size shown in Figure S4. The
NaOH-11 condition has the second-lowest efficiency at 13% while maintaining
the highest corona layer size regardless of pAb aggregation or denaturation.
Efficiency is found to be drastically different when tested with and
without EDC/NHS to assess the effects of electrostatic interactions
(Figure S22). The uptake of the pAb to
the AuNP via carbodiimide crosslinking is most efficient at the MES-4.5
and MES-6 conditions. On the contrary, when bioconjugation is performed
without EDC/NHS, the MOPs-7.9 condition has the highest pAb physisorption
efficiency at 38%. Furthermore, pAb chemisorption efficiency decreases
drastically for the HCl-2, NaOH-11, and MOPs-7.9 conditions (Figure S22). Thus, the two MES pH conditions
are expected to have the highest packing density, which is in line
with the TEM analysis, with the exception of the NaOH-11 condition.

The TEM images corroborate the results of the Lorentz FT-IR fittings,
(Figures 3 and 4) showing corona layer assembly around each of the
particles barring MOPs-7.9. Comparing the MOPs-7.9 condition with
the DLS data (Figure 2A) shows an inherent increase in size due to interactions other than
protein binding, which is minimal. The HCl-2 TEM images show apparent
denaturation and aggregation of the pAb around the AuNP, indicated
by the loose tendril-like chains, which are not tightly packed against
the particles. Hence, the discrepancy between the corona layer size
and high pAb adsorption efficiency is attributed to the large aggregates
observed and the denatured pAbs at the HCl-2 condition. The particularly
large corona layer assembly around the NaOH-11 AuNP is in line with
the high pAb adsorption efficiency. This suggests that the NaOH-11
condition causes physical adsorption to occur, where pAb efficiency
is higher than other conditions, and TEM corona formation is larger
than 6 nm, which is expected for pH conditions much higher than the
pAb pI.24

Conclusions
This
study details the effect of pH on the stability and binding
nature of L. monocytogenes targeting
polyclonal antibodies (pAb) to carboxyl-functionalized gold nanoparticles
(COOH–AuNPs). The results shown here demonstrate the tunability
of a well-established carbodiimide reaction for the pAb–AuNP
formation based on binding efficiency, corona layer assembly type
and size, and aggregate formation. The pAb–AuNP formation is
found to maintain increased binding efficiency at the moderately low
MES-4.5 and MES-6 test conditions as compared to alternative pH conditions.
By comparison, efficiency due to electrostatic adsorptions shows the
MOPs-7.9 maintaining the highest binding efficiency, shown by the
calibration of pAb remaining in the supernatant. Corona layer assembly
is found to be ideally sized at the pH 4.5 and 6 conditions, while
showing a large layer at pH 11, nonexistent at pH 7.9, and with protein
denaturation at pH 2. The ATR-FT-IR for the pH 4.5 and 6 conditions
suggests the formation of new covalent bonds, while maintaining stability
throughout the amide I and II regions, key indicators of the pAb maintaining
their structure. Conversely, the pH 11 condition shows signs only
of physical adsorption. The aggregate formation causes complications
when optimizing the pAb–AuNP complex formation. Overall, we
demonstrate the exquisite balance to bind polyclonal antibodies to
carboxyl-functionalized AuNP at different pH and buffer conditions.
For pAb–AuNP bioconjugation, the MES-6 condition should be
utilized despite the low binding efficiency obtained by UV–vis,
due to indicators of covalent bonding and stability in the pAb secondary
structure from FT-IR, corona layer formation and morphology of TEM,
and the charge stabilization of ζ-potential.
