Introduction
Heterocyclic compounds
are the core building units for the design
and synthesis of new molecular entities for drug discovery. Among
the myriad of bioactive molecules, a large number of molecules encompass
indole derivatives.1 Substituted indoles
are of immense interest as they found applications as pharmaceuticals,
drugs, agrochemicals, and in materials science.2 Most of the biologically relevant indole alkaloids are
C-3-substituted, for example, natural amino acid tryptophan and the
neurotransmitter serotonin.3

Traditionally,
C-3 benzylation of indoles was achieved mainly via
Friedel–Crafts reactions or SN2 reaction
of benzyl halides with indoles.4 However,
the use of a stoichiometric amount of Lewis acids and formation of
unwanted by-products reduce the effectiveness of these methodologies.5 Therefore, the demand for mild, efficient, and
economic methods for the direct alkylation of indoles remains an area
of active research.6

Benzylic alcohols
are gaining interest as green alkylating agents
as the only by-product generated is water, thereby producing an environmentally
benign and clean process7 compared to the
use of corresponding halides, esters, carboxylates, or related compounds
for this purpose.8

In the past few
years, many studies have reported the C-3 benzylation
reactions by using expensive transition metal complex based catalytic
systems with Fe,9 Ir,10 Au,7 In,8 Pd,11 Pt,12 and Ru,13 which are moisture- and air-sensitive,8,9 and their preparation process needed complex handling10,12 and harsh conditions,8,10,12 which limit their practical utility in a large scale. Some methods
required the addition of oxidants, ligands,7,10 bases,9,10 or other additives13 to maximize the
catalyst activity and complete their catalytic pathway. Metal-free
processes are always favorable in the pharmaceutical industry due
to the additional difficulties associated with the metal impurities.14

Therefore, there is rising demand for
the development of metal-free
catalytic systems for C-3 benzylation, which has been less explored
to date and will be a beneficial alternative to transition-metal catalysis.
Yus and co-workers have reported noncatalytic C-3 alkylation by alcohols
through a hydrogen-autotransfer strategy with a stoichiometric amount
of base.15 There are reports of C-3 benzylation
catalyzed by Br2,16 N-heterocyclic
carbene,17 high-temperature water,18 and some Lewis19 and
Brønsted acids.20 In recent times,
molecular iodine has emerged as a green and environmentally benign
reagent and has been successfully employed as a catalyst in different
organic transformations forming new C–C, C–N, C–O,
and C–S bonds in organic compounds.21 It is naturally abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, environmentally
friendly, and active even in very small amounts.22 Inspired by its catalytic activeness and economic viability,23 we herein report a green, efficient, and economical
strategy for C-3 selective benzylation of indoles employing molecular
iodine as a catalyst under ligand-, metal-, and base-free conditions
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 C-3 Benzylation of 1-Methylindole (1a)
Results and Discussion
The studies
were initiated with 1-methylindole and diphenylmethanol
as substrates to establish the best reaction conditions. It was found
that 1-methylindole and diphenylmethanol when treated with molecular
iodine (5 mol %) in toluene at 40 °C produced the C-3 benzylated
product in 85% yield in 5 h (Table 1, entry 1).

C-3-substituted
product formation is confirmed by the presence
of characteristic peaks at δ 118.3 (for C-3) and 127.4 (for
C-2) in 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3).7 The single-crystal structure of 3a further confirms the C-3 selectivity of the reaction. The
crystal structure is solved and refined in the orthorhombic space
group Pna21, with one symmetry independent molecule
in the lattice ORTEP with 50% probability ellipsoids displayed in Figure 1. Details of the
single-crystal X-ray data collection method, crystal data parameter
table, CIF, and Check CIF report are available in the Supporting Information.

No desired product was
observed in the absence of the I2 catalyst even after 12
h (Table 1, entry 2).
Hence in order to study the activity of
iodine as a catalyst, reactions were performed by varying the amount
of catalyst. Use of 2 mol % catalyst gave lower yield (Table 1, entry 4),
and an increased amount of 10 mol % catalyst gave no significant improvement
in the yield (Table 1, entry 5). The highest activity was observed using 5 mol % catalyst
(Table 1, entry 1).
In order to study the effect of temperature, the reactions were performed
by varying the conditions at rt, 40 °C, and 60 °C, and the
best result was observed at 40 °C (Table 1, entries 1, 3, and 6). Performing under
a N2 atmosphere produced similar results indicating no
role of oxygen in the reaction (Table 1, entry 7). The effects of other iodine-containing
additives were investigated at 40 °C, and no reaction was observed
with 5 mol % KI (Table 1, entry 8), which proved the effectiveness of I2 as a
catalyst for the current protocol. Most of the aprotic solvents such
as toluene, DCM, MeCN, and 1,4-dioxane resulted in acceptable yields
(Table 1, entries 1,
and 9–11) except for DMSO and DMF where no product formation
was observed even after extended reaction times (Table 1, entries 12 and 13). In contrast,
no reaction proceeded at all in protic solvents such as H2O, MeOH, and EtOH (Table 1, entries 14–16). From the study of the influence of
the solvent on the reaction, some important conclusions on the mode
of iodine catalysis can be drawn. In the presence of protic solvents,
iodine is known to decompose slowly to form Brønsted acid HI,
which is responsible for further reaction catalysis.21 However, from the observations of Table 1, no reaction proceeded at all in protic
solvents such as H2O, MeOH, and EtOH (Table 1, entries 14–16), which
clearly rules out the contribution of Brønsted acid mode of catalysis
by molecular iodine. On the other hand, iodine in most aprotic solvents
gave acceptable yields (Table 1, entries 1 and 9–11), which accounts for the halogen-bond
activation mechanism of molecular iodine.21 It also explains why no product formation was observed in DMSO and
DMF despite being aprotic solvents as they are expected to form strong
halogen bonds with molecular iodine resulting in deactivation of the
catalyst for further reaction.21 The reaction
did not require any external base or additives.

The scope and
limitations of the C-3 benzylation of indoles were
investigated based on electronically diverse indole and benzyl alcohol
derivatives. The results are summarized in Scheme 2. Benzyl alcohols with both electron-donating
substituents such as Me and OMe (Scheme 2: 3e, 3h–3k) and electron-withdrawing substituents such as Cl and Br
(Scheme 2: 3c, 3d, 3f, 3q) afforded products
in good yields (70–92%). Primary benzylic alcohols with electron-donating
substituents (OMe) resulted in the desired product in 83% yield (Scheme 2: 3j), whereas electron-poor or unsubstituted primary benzylic alcohols
resulted in no reaction. This observation can be explained by the
increased stability of intermediate species formed during the process
in the presence of electron-rich benzylic systems. In contrast, secondary
benzylic alcohols bearing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups afforded the benzylated products in 80–90% yield (Scheme 2: 3a–3i, 3k). Tertiary benzylic alcohols
showed highest reactivity and resulted in the desired products in
90–92% yield (Scheme 2: 3l, 3m), which can be attributed
to the carbocation stability. Interestingly, if the 3-position of
indole is preoccupied, the reaction proceeds at the 2-position (Scheme 2: 3n). Sensitive functionalities such as Br, Cl, carbonyl, and OMe remained
unaffected under the reaction conditions. The protocol was also examined
for chain alkyl alcohol but produced no significant result.

Scheme 2 C-3 Benzylation
of Indole with Benzyl Alcohols
Reaction conditions: indole
(1.2 equiv), alcohol (1 equiv), iodine (5 mol %), toluene (2 mL),
temp (40 °C), time (5 h), in air.

From Table 1, it
was observed that no reaction proceeds in protic solvents due to the
decomposition of iodine into HI ruling out Brønsted acid mode
of catalysis. To experimentally prove the contribution of the halogen-bond
activation mechanism of molecular iodine in our catalytic pathway,
the following experiments were performed. 1-Methylindole and diphenylmethanol
when treated with molecular iodine in toluene at 40 °C produced
the C-3 benzylated product in 85% yield in 5 h (Table 2, entry 1). On the other hand, addition of
aqueous HI (57 wt %) produced only 26% of the desired product, which
supported our earlier observation on solvent effects and excluded
the contribution of Brønsted acid mode of catalysis for the reaction
pathway (Table 2, entry
5). We analyzed the influence of trace amounts of water (the amount
of water present in aqueous HI) in the reaction on the catalytic activity
of molecular iodine and observed no comparable change in reactivity
(Table 2, entry 2).
The catalytic activity of molecular iodine is suppressed by the addition
of KI due to the formation of triiodide ions,24 which is evident from the lowered reaction yield (Table 2, entry 3) whereas the activity
of HI remains unchanged (Table 2, entry 6). Addition of a molecular sieve (25 mg) resulted
in no change in reactivity of molecular iodine (Table 2, entry 4) indicating no moisture sensitivity.

From the experimental observations and literature
findings, a plausible
mechanism has been proposed as shown in Scheme 3. The first step is expected to be the activation
of alcohol by iodine forming a halogen bond between the oxygen of
benzyl alcohol 1 and molecular iodine.21a The oxygen atom of the alcohol bears a partial positive
charge due to the halogen bonding and forms an intermediate species
as shown in 2, which is stabilized by the resonance effect
(+R effect) of the phenyl rings attached to the nearby secondary carbon
center. In the presence of strong π-nucleophile indole 3, an electrophilic substitution reaction takes place at the
C-3 position of the indole ring (the most nucleophilic center on the
indole nucleus) to form an intermediate species 4, which
undergoes rearomatization to form 3-benzylated indole 5 with elimination of water and regeneration of molecular iodine to
complete the catalytic cycle. No generation of any other side products
in the reaction was observed. The stability of the intermediate species 2 can be increased by introducing electron-donating substituents
to the phenyl rings or using tertiary benzyl alcohols.

Scheme 3 Plausible
Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed a protocol for the C-3 selective
benzylation of indoles with benzylic alcohols employing molecular
iodine as a green catalyst. Our protocol is simple and environmentally
benign and proceeds under ligand-, metal-, and base-free conditions.
The mild conditions and wide functional group tolerance make the protocol
suitable for further applications.

Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck
silica gel 60F254 plates using short wave (254 nm) UV light. Column
chromatography purifications were performed over silica gel (100–200
mesh). 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra
were recorded on a JEOL JNM ECS NMR spectrometer (400 and 100 MHz,
respectively) using CDCl3 as the solvent and TMS as the
internal standard. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts
per million (ppm) relative to the central peak of the solvent. Multiplicities
are indicated as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet),
m (multiplet), dd (doublet of doublet), and br (broad). Coupling constants
(J values) are given in hertz (Hz). HRMS data were
recorded via electrospray ionization with a Q-TOF mass analyzer. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction spectra were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX-II
CCD diffractometer using Mo Kα (λ =0.71073 Å) radiation.
Melting points were recorded in a digital melting point apparatus
and are uncorrected. All chemicals used were purchased commercially
and used without further purification. Solvents used for extraction
and chromatographic separations were distilled prior use.

General Procedure
for C-3 Benzylation of Indoles with Benzylic
Alcohols
A round-bottom flask was charged with indole 1 (1 mmol) and alcohol 2 (0.8 mmol) in the presence
of 5 mol % (0.05 mmol, 12.6 mg) molecular iodine (I2) in
toluene (2 mL) at 40 °C for 5 h. After completion of reaction
(confirmed by TLC), the reaction mixture was poured into water and
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl
acetate) to give the desired products 3a–3s.
