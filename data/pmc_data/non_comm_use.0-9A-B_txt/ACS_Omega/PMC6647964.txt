The
selective separation of ethanol/acetonitrile by porous materials
has rarely been observed owing to their similar physicochemical properties.
In this work, we report a new coordination network, [Cu2(4-pmntd)2(opd)2](4-pmntd = N,N′-bis(4-pyridymethy)naphthalene diimide,
opd = disodium 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate), which exhibits selective
separation of ethanol over acetonitrile. The weak coordination bonds
formed by unsaturated Cu2+ sites and hydroxyl groups are
the key to such performance.

==== Body
Introduction
Acetonitrile (CH3CN) is an important organic solvent
in the chemical industry, for example, acetonitrile is usually used
in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and photographic films.1 Acetonitrile was also found to play an important
role in the field of liquid chromatography because of its low viscosity
and low chemical reactivity.2,3 Catalytic dehydrogenation
from ammonia and ethanol is generally used in acetonitrile production.4 This method usually introduces some contaminants,
such as unreacted ethanol. Thus, it is important to capture and separate
ethanol from acetonitrile to use acetonitrile as the chemical feedback.5−8 In industry, acetonitrile was purified by membrane distillation.
This process is energy-intensive and inefficient because of the formation
of azeotropes at a specific concentration because of the similar boiling
points (acetonitrile, 81.1 °C; ethanol, 78.4 °C). Therefore,
it is urgent to develop a new method for efficiently separating small
molecules with similar physicochemical properties.

Recent studies
have shown that porous material adsorption and separation
has the advantage of high energy efficiency and low regeneration cost.9−12 As a new generation of porous materials, coordination networks [also
known as coordination polymers,13,14 metal–organic
frameworks,15,16 or metal–organic materials
(MOMs)17,18], have attracted much attention because
of their unique porosity and chemical diversity.19−25 In the past decades, a great number of MOMs have been already investigated
for gas storage26−28 and separations (e.g., CO2/N2,29 CO2/CH4,30 CO2/CO,31 CO2/C2H2,32,33 and C2H2/C2H434,35). However, to the best of our knowledge, current MOMs did not exhibit
promising liquid mixture separation, such as acetonitrile/ethanol.
Thus, how to achieve efficient separation of liquid mixture (such
as acetonitrile/ethanol) by MOMs is still a challenge. The naphthalene
diimides containing naphthalene π-unit and imide region in forming
weak supramolecular interactions are an organic electron deficient
system with excellent thermal, light, and air stability.36−41 The LUMO level of pyridine ring naphthalene diimides is −4.24
eV and the maximum absorption wavelength is 361 nm.38 The naphthalene diimide-based coordination polymers could
have abundant electronic properties that are beneficial for selective
adsorption. In this study, we introduce a new coordination network
constructed by a naphthalene diimide ligand, [Cu2(4-pmntd)2(CH3OH)4(opd)2], which displays
selective adsorption water, methanol, ethanol, and separation ability
of acetonitrile/ethanol.

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structures and
Characterizations
Solvothermal
reaction of diimide-based ligand42−444-pmntd and carboxyl
ligand opd with Cu(NO3)2·6H2O in the mixture solvents of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O at 70 °C afforded green crystals of {[Cu2(4-pmntd)2(CH3OH)4(opd)2]}n (1·MeOH). Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed that compound 1·MeOH crystallized in orthorhombic space group Ccca.
In 1·MeOH, each Cu2+ was coordinated
by two nitrogen atoms from two 4-pmntd ligands and two oxygen atoms
from two opd ligands (Figure 1). It was noted that the Cu2+ was also bonded by
two apical oxygen atoms from methanol molecules and the Cu–O
bond length is 2.629 Å, indicating that there was weak interaction
between Cu2+ and methanol molecules. Consequently, the
Cu2+ cations of 1·MeOH adopt an octahedral
coordination geometry and serve as 4-connected nodes. The topology
of this compound is a noninterpenetrated uninodal 2D network, which
was revealed by the TOPOS45 software (Figure 2). The point symbol
of the framework is (42.63.8) with a 4L1 (TotUMod)
topological type in the reticular chemistry structure resource.46 The independent 2D networks are staggered relatively
to each other to form rectangular-shaped tubular channels occupied
by guest molecules. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that
the as-synthesized 1·MeOH loses guest molecules
below 110 °C and retains stability until to 220 °C (Figure S3).

ion in compound 1·MeOH.

(b) 4L1(42.63.8) topological net.

Compound 1·MeOH underwent single-crystal-to-single-crystal
(SCSC) transformation after the coordinated methanol molecules were
removed by heating at 110 °C to form the desolvated phase, [Cu(4-pmntd)
(opd)]n·(1·dry).
Although the crystal system and space group remain unchanged, the
copper center in 1·dry became tetra-coordinated
with a quadrilateral coordination environment. Such coordination change
is accompanied by apparent color change from green (1·MeOH) to violet (1·dry). Therefore, the unsaturated
metal sites were formed in 1·dry and could have
potential applications for selective gas/vapor separation because
of the metal–guest interactions. Interestingly, a single crystal
of 1·dry can revert to 1·MeOH when
soaked in methanol at room temperature and the color can return to
green, indicating that the structural transformation is reversible.
Further, 1·dry was shown to exhibit SCSC structural
change after the immersion of the single crystal into water or ethanol
to form 1·H2O and 1·EtOH. SCXRD revealed that the coordination
geometry of Cu2+ in 1·H2O and 1·EtOH is octahedral with
coordinated solvent molecules (Figure 3).

Vapor Adsorption Studies
To investigate vapor sorption
properties, samples of the as-synthesized 1·MeOH were first activated to afford 1·dry and the vapor
sorption performance of 1·dry was investigated at
298 K. For water (H2O) adsorption, a rapid increase in
the amount of adsorbed vapor under low pressure (0 < P/P0 < 0.02) was observed, indicating
initial adsorption with two molecules of water per unit pore. Further,
at the pressure range of 0.03 < P/P0 < 0.3, an increase of adsorption corresponding to
one molecule of water per unit pore. The third stepwise sorption was
occurred at 0.3 < P/P0 < 0.4, revealing the adsorption of two water molecules per unit
pore. H2O adsorption reached the saturation uptake (ca.
125 cm3 g–1) when the pressure over P/P0 > 0.4. According to
the
interesting stepped isotherm, we assumed that two water molecules
were first adsorbed on the unsaturated Cu2+ sites, followed
by three water molecules entering the pores of the network. The above
assumption is consistent with the results of single crystal X-ray
diffraction analysis, which indicates that 1·dry could adsorb two water molecules at the unsaturated Cu2+ metal site and three water molecules in the pores. Such different
binding sites result in the stepped isotherm (Figure 4a). In addition, we also studied the methanol
(CH3OH) sorption of 1·dry. Similar to
water sorption, 1·dry exhibited an initial adsorption
at 0 < P/P0 < 0.2,
which corresponding to about two methanol molecules per unit pore,
and then one methanol molecule was adsorbed into the pores at 0.2
< P/P0 < 0.8 (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 (a) Water and methanol
adsorption isotherms of 1·dry at 298 K. (b) Ethanol
and acetonitrile absorption isotherms of 1·dry at
298 K.

Being different with water, ethanol
adsorption of 1·dry displays the one-step isotherm
with uptake around 50 cm3 g–1 at 100
kPa (Figure 4b). Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction of 1·EtOH revealed that two ethanol
molecules were coordinated
with unsaturated Cu2+. Remarkably, the acetonitrile (CH3CN) uptake of 1·dry at 298 K was found to
be negligible (ca. 10 cm3 g–1 at 100
kPa). The naphthalene diimide-based coordination polymers are hydrogen-bonded
frameworks for the imide carbonyl groups being the acceptor of hydrogen-bonded. 1·dry selective adsorption of water, methanol, and ethanol
for them contain the hydroxyl groups as hydrogen-bonded donors and
interact with unsaturated Cu2+ sites. The big molecular
size and no hydroxyl group of acetonitrile can neither interact with
unsaturated Cu2+ sites nor enter the pores (Figure 5). The mixed solvents, ethanol
and acetonitrile, are commonly used such as in phase chromatography
of biomolecules and the ethanol/acetonitrile separation and recycling,
which are of great significance. The high ethanol uptake and low acetonitrile
uptake of 1·dry at 100 kPa are beneficial for the
ethanol/acetonitrile separation at ambient temperature.

of the selective interaction between hydroxylic
guests and unsaturated Cu2+ metal sites.

Ethanol/Acetonitrile Separation
Given the differences
in the adsorption behaviors of the 1·dry for ethanol
and acetonitrile, we utilized 1·dry as a stationary
phase to discover the separation performance of ethanol/acetonitrile
binary mixtures. A column (10 × 10 × 100 mm) was packed
with 1·dry (ca. 10 g) and then let 1 mL ethanol
and 1 mL acetonitrile binary mixtures pass through the column. Evolved
solvent components were monitored by NMR (integrating the peak area).
In the experiment, C2H5OH and CH3CN were initially coadsorbed before CH3CN was replaced
by C2H5OH. An acetonitrile outlet purity was
increased from 50 to 70% (Figure 6). We assume that the specific interaction between
unsaturated metal sites and hydroxylic guest (ethanol) plays a vital
role for such real ethanol/acetonitrile separation performance. Furthermore,
the TGA studies indicate that the coordinated ethanol molecules in
the pores of 1·EtOH could be removed by heating
up to 110 °C and readsorbed by dispersing the material to ethanol
vapor at room temperature. These procedures can be repeated for five
cycles, validating the reversibility of the process (Figure S4).

the packed sample (1·dry).

Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrates a strategy
that constructed
open metal sites in coordination networks and could improve the selective
sorption between hydroxylic guests and nonhydroxylic guests. This
new naphthalene diimide-based coordination polymer is the first example
that exhibits selective separation of ethanol/acetonitrile at ambient
temperature.

Experimental Section
Physical Measurements
Elemental analyses (C, H, and
N) were carried out with a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer. FT-IR
spectra were obtained from KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400
cm–1 on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Cu Kα,
1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Thermal analyses were performed
on a TGA V5.1A Dupont 2100 instrument from room temperature to 800
°C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in
the air, and the data are consistent with the structures. The vapor
adsorption isotherms (at 298 K) were measured by using the BELSORP-max
automatic volumetric sorption apparatus.
