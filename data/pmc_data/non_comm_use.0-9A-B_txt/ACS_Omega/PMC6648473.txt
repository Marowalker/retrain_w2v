Conductive natural
rubber (NR) nanocomposites were prepared by
solvent-casting suspensions of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), followed by vulcanization of the rubber composites.
Both rGO and CNT were compatible as fillers in the NR as well as having
sufficient intrinsic electrical conductivity for functional applications.
Physical (thermal) and chemical reduction of GO were investigated,
and the results of the reductions were monitored by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy for establishing a reduction protocol that was useful
for the rGO nanocomposite preparation. Field-emission scanning electron
microscopy showed that both nanofillers were adequately dispersed
in the main NR phase. The CNT composite displays a marked mechanical
hysteresis and higher elongation at break, in comparison to the rGO
composites for an equal fraction of the carbon phase. Moreover, the
composite conductivity was always ca. 3–4 orders of magnitude
higher for the CNT composite than for the rGO composites, the former
reaching a maximum conductivity of ca. 10.5 S/m, which was explained
by the more favorable geometry of the CNT versus the rGO sheets. For
low current density applications though, both composites achieved
the necessary percolation and showed the electrical conductivity needed
for being applied as flexible conductors for a light-emitting diode.

Introduction
Graphene and reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) sheets consist of hexagonally
arranged layered aromatic lattices, typically sized 2–5 μm
laterally with a thickness of 2–3 nm, which are held together
by sp3 σ–C–C and sp2-hybridized
carbon atoms forming a π bond.1 The
bonds allow electron conduction within the sheets at an estimated
speed of 1000 cm2 V–1 s–1, making this allotrope of carbon interesting as a filler in polymers
for preparation of conductive lightweight polymer nanocomposites.2−4 However, although its sheet morphology with in-plane conduction
may show excellent intrinsic conductivity, any composite conductivity
on a larger scale is essentially based on a reliable network formation
of the sheets. The rGO will here inevitably show fewer contact points
as compared to randomly organized high-aspect-ratio rod-like fillers,
for example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs).5 It
is thus of general interest to investigate the possibilities and limitations
of graphene as a filler material to generate conductive polymer composites
for soft material applications, such as materials for electrical insulation,6 minimal static charge build-up,7,8 and to even electrical conduction with charge transfer, for example,
within electronics.9−11

The interest in rGO as a nanofiller material
is further motivated
considering the often limited conductivity of graphene and rGO in
composites due to the nematic phase formation caused by partial phase
separations of the rGO sheets in solution.12 It is here of relevance to compare rGO with CNT as conductive fillers
because CNTs have been demonstrated to form percolating networks at
a volume fraction as low as 0.00125 vol %, that is because of the
long slender morphologies of the CNTs.13 A simple comparison with CNTs is however not straight forward because
of the wide range of resistivity values reported for the graphene
sheets obtained as rGO. This is because the conductance in any percolating
carbon filler network also depends on the intrinsic conductivity of
the individual sheets, which strongly depends on the reduction route.14 Reductions of GO to rGO rely on the chemically
or thermally assisted removal of hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, and carboxyl
groups, which often yields only partially rGO.15,16 Comparative measurements on identically processed well-defined carbon-based
fillers, such as CNTs, in relation to rGO obtained from a proven effective
reduction protocol (ensuring reproducible high intrinsic conductivity
within the sheets) will here provide valuable insights into the graphene
performance as a carbon filler.14

In this article, we describe the preparation of rGO/natural rubber
(NR) and CNT/NR nanocomposites by solvent casting followed by cross-linking
of the formed conductive NR nanocomposite. NR was chosen as a high-performance
elastomer because of its unique elastic properties, which allow for
a complete recovery after significant deformation, for example, 400%
stretching. For this reason, NR is a promising material even for applications
that are beyond the tire industry,18 such
as flexible electronics.17,18 The possibility to
integrate the two nanofillers (CNTs and rGO) by simple solvent-based
mixing, without using physical mixing techniques such as internal
mixing, was investigated. The electrical performance of the resulting
NR composites was then compared and evaluated. The electrical performance
of identically processed CNTs/NR and rGO/NR composites revealed 1000
times higher conductivity for the same filler content when using commercial
CNTs. However, the preparation method allowed for reaching sufficient
electrical percolation to run a light-emitting diode (LED) for both
the rGO and CNT composites (ca. minimum conduction: 10–4 S/m). Mechanical tests coupled with electrical tests were also performed
to gather information about the strain history of the material as
displayed by electrical measurements. A previously unreported electrical
and mechanical hysteresis effect was observed for the CNT nanocomposites,
opening for the obtained composites to be used as flexible strain
memory sensors.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
GO prepared
via the Hummer method19 was supplied by
Angstrom Materials, USA, as
a suspension (solid content 0.5 wt %), reference number N002-PS, containing
46 wt % carbon, 46 wt % oxygen, 3 wt % hydrogen, and 0.5 wt % nitrogen.
According to specification, more than 90% of the sheets had a lateral
size above 1.2 μm. Multiwall CNTs (grade Flotube 700, purity
≥ 93%, average diameter of 6–8 nm, and a length up to
50 μm) were delivered by CNano Technology Limited, Beijing,
China. The reducing agent sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was
obtained as ≥98% powder from Aldrich Chemistry and sodium hydroxide
(NaOH, ≥97%) was supplied by Alfa Aesar. Ammonium hydroxide
was 28–30% by concentration, reagent grade from Sigma-Aldrich.
The NR was tapped from Hevea brasiliensis trees, coagulated by formic acid, precompounded in Malaysia, and
supplied as 10CV60 by Syarikat Chuan Lee Rubber SDN. BHD., Malaysia.
Zinc oxide (99.8% purity) and reagent grade sulphur (≥99.5%)
were obtained from VWR. Stearic acid (≥97%) was purchased from
Merck, and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzotiazolsulfenamide
(CBS, >99.5%) was delivered by Henan Hengrui Rubber Plastic Science.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF, ≥99.7%) was purchased from VWR International,
toluene (≥99.5%) and acetone (≥99.9%) were obtained
from Fisher Chemical, n-hexane (purity ≥97%)
and p-xylene (purity ≥99%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and dichloromethane or chloroform was supplied
from Merck Eurolab (≥99%). Ultrapure reagent type-1 water was
used unless otherwise noted.

Preparation of Thermally rGO
Two
methods of thermal
reduction of GO were used: (i) a low-temperature treatment inside
a vacuum oven at 150 °C for 60 min, (ii) a high-temperature process
at 1000 °C for 5 s. For both of these processes, the 0.5 wt %
GO suspension was first freeze-dried into a porous foam, which was
subsequently placed inside a polypropylene Eppendorf test tube or
a quartz tube for the low- and high-temperature treatment, respectively.
The final foam of rGO was analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) to determine its elemental composition.

Preparation of Chemically
rGO
The chemical reduction
of GO was performed for comparison to the thermal route (above). To
this scope, 2 mL of the 0.5 wt % GO suspension was placed into 10
mL glass vials under magnetic stirring (900 rpm) at 50 °C (under
air). The sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reducing agent20 was prepared separately as 3, 6, and 12 g/L
aqueous solutions. For each 2 mL GO sample, a premixture of 3 mL of
the prepared reducing agent solution and 100 μL buffer of 54
mM of sodium hydroxide or ammonia was added. The final concentrations
of the components in the reaction vessels were 0.2 wt % GO with 44,
88, or 176 mM NaBH4 and 54 mM NaOH or ammonia. The reduction
process was carried out for 2 h under constant stirring. The rGO samples
were washed from excess sodium and boron ions by three exchanges of
the sample supernatant, using centrifugation at 12 100 relative
centrifugal force (RCF) for 30 min, followed by redispersion in water.
An aliquot of each sample was freeze-dried to evaluate the chemical
composition by XPS. The effect of using different concentrations of
NaBH4 was evaluated by measuring the differences in electrical
conductivity of compacted foams. The refined rGO–water dispersions
were further solvent exchanged into the final solvents, using acetone
as a solvent bridge (using the above centrifugation procedure). The
final rGO concentration in the specific solvents used for preparation
of the cast rubber solutions was adjusted to 0.5 wt %. The estimated
surface area of the rGO sheets is 13 035 mm2g−1.21

Preparation of CNT Suspensions
The dry multiwalled
CNTs were dispersed by ultrasonication into THF or toluene by using
a Sonics Vibra-Cell VCX 750 ultrasonication probe (6 mm tip), for
10 min at 21% of the maximum power 750 W. The final CNT concentration
in the solvents was adjusted to 0.5 wt %. A transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) micrograph of the used CNT is shown in the Figure
S1 (Supporting Information). The used multiwalled
CNTs had lengths of ca. 40 μm, 20 nm thickness and a wall thickness
of 8 nm. The estimated surface area of the CNT is 1 610 mm2g−1.21

Preparation
of NR Solutions
A screening of different
solvents for liquid mixing of the solvent-borne rGO sheets and CNT,
and the NR matrix, was carried out for THF, toluene, n-hexane, p-xylene, dichloromethane, and chloroform
as 5 vol % NR solutions. Two up-scaled separate master batches of
dissolved rubber were prepared by addition of 50 mL of NR to 950 mL
of the respective THF and toluene solvent (5 vol %). These master
batches were passed through a Büchner no. 1 filter to remove
particles remaining from the smoking and compounding of the NR in
Malaysia. The resulting translucent solutions were corrected in concentration
by addition of solvent that evaporated during the vacuum-assisted
filtration and were used for all subsequent experiments.

Preparation
of Conductive Composites
The solvent-borne
rGO or CNTs were mixed into the NR solutions together with the required
additives used for vulcanization and homogenized for 5 min at 5000
rpm with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (IKA, D125 Basic), followed by
ultrasonication of the solution in a traditional ultrasonication bath
for 5 min. The vulcanization additives consisted of 5 phr (parts per
hundred of the reagent per 100 g of NR) ZnO, 3 phr sulphur, 1 phr
stearic acid, and 0.8 phr CBS in each solution (equivalent to 4.6
wt % ZnO, 2.7 wt % sulphur, 0.9 wt % stearic acid and 0.7 wt % CBS,
respectively), relative to the amount of NR used. The final composition
with regard to the carbonaceous phase was adjusted by adding different
amounts of the master batches containing 0.5 wt % rGO or CNTs (above).
The solutions were poured into square-shaped glass molds (20 ×
20 cm2) and left to dry at ambient conditions for 12 h.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000, equipped with
a single reflectance attenuated total reflectance (ATR) MkII Golden
Gate stage from Specac, Ltd., London, UK) was used to monitor and
confirm complete evaporation of all solvents before the vulcanization.
A uniform evaporation of the solvents resulted in ca. 300 μm
thick rubber composite films. The films were rolled off the mold and
placed in a standardized metallic mold for tensile test specimens
(ISO 37:2005 Type 3, 50 mm overall length, 20 mm length of narrow
region and 1 mm thickness) and were vulcanized under 30 kN of pressure
at 145 °C for 1 h in a hot press (Fontijne TP400 with press plates
320 × 320 mm). The method is shown in Figure 1. Accordingly, all the conductive composites
(rGO/NR and CNT/NR) were prepared by the above solvent mixing technique,
using the same vulcanization time as established for a sample prepared
by conventional mixing on a Banbury unit (see below).

Figure 1 Preparation of the NR
films by solvent casting. The films were
left to dry after casting under normal atmosphere (a). Thereafter,
they were rolled (b) into cylinders (c) and finally vulcanized into
50 × 10 mm sheets from the rolled probes (d).

To ensure that the solvent mixing process did not
influence the
physical properties of the rubber matrix (without any conductive nanofillers),
a reference NR sample was compounded using a Banbury internal mixer,
denoted as IM. The temperature during the mixing was controlled at
50–60 °C and the total compounding time was ca. 15 min.
This sample was vulcanized under 30 kN of pressure at 145 °C
for 1 h in a hot press (Fontijne TP400 with press plates 320 ×
320 mm). The solvent mixed and the IM prepared samples are compared
in Table 2, only containing
the vulcanization agents.

Electron Microscopy
Cold field scanning
electron microscopy
was performed on a Hitachi S-4800. For the nonconductive samples,
a Pt/Pd 60/40 alloy was sputtered onto the sample using a Cressington
208HR high-resolution sputter prior to the observation. TEM was performed
on a Hitachi HT-7700 operated at 100 kV.

Electrical Characterization
The electrical conductivity
of the CNT, GO, and rGO rubber films was evaluated on a Keithley 2400
SourceMeter connected to a collinear four-point probe setup (spacing
5 mm with gold plated 45° conical tips). The distance to any
boundary was always more than 5 probe spacing’s (>25 mm);
thus,
the analytical correction factor of π/ln(2) = 4.53 could be
used without further modification in accordance to ASTM F 390. When
measuring on the final vulcanized samples during the in situ mechanical/electrical
testing, the conductivity was measured from four separate contact
strips connected in a Kelvin bridge along the narrow section of the
tensile testing specimens. The distance between the two inner sensing
contacts was taken as the initial distance of the unstretched samples
multiplied with the measured elongation recorded during the test.
The cross-sectional area was calculated from a constant volume criteria
during the tensile tests (Poisson’s ratio ≈ 0.5),22 and no grip slippage was observed.

XPS Analysis
XPS measurements were performed in an
M-Probe instrument (Surface Science Instruments, USA) equipped with
a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) with a spot size of
200 μm × 750 μm and a pass energy of 25 eV, providing
a resolution for 0.74 eV. The energy scale was calibrated with reference
to the 4f7/2 level of a freshly evaporated gold sample,
at 84.0 ± 0.1 eV, and with reference to the 2p3/2 and
3s levels of copper at 932.47 ± 0.1 and 122.39 ± 0.15 eV,
respectively. With a monochromatic source, an electron flood gun was
used to compensate for the build-up of positive charge on the insulator
samples during the analyses: a value of 10 eV was selected for these
samples to be measured. For all the samples, the C 1s peak level was
taken as the internal reference at 284.6 eV. The accuracy of the reported
binding energies (BEs) can be estimated to be ±0.2 eV. Wide scan
XPS survey spectra were used to gather information on the surface
atomic composition of pristine GO samples and rGO samples. High-resolution
spectra of C 1s was used to determine the carbon functionalities of
GO and rGO.

IR Spectroscopy
IR spectroscopy
was performed using
a Spectrum 2000 Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) spectrometer (PerkinElmer
Inc., USA). A total of 16 scans were recorded. The Spectrum 2000 was
equipped with a Golden Gate (Specac Ltd.) single reflection ATR accessory
mounting a diamond crystal. All samples were placed in a desiccator
for at least 1 week before the analyses.

Tensile Testing
Tensile testing of the rubber samples
were carried out in an Instron 5566 mechanical tester in conjunction
with a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter to acquire the in situ conductivity
during the tensile tests. The strain rate was 20 mm/min, and all samples
were conditioned at 23 °C and 50% RH for 14 days prior to each
test. The specimens had a shape and size according to ISO 37:2005
Type 3, see previous paragraph.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
after Reduction to rGO
The starting material
GO used for the evaluation of different reduction routes, as well
as the rGO, is shown as freeze-dried porous powders in Figure 2. The GO sheets seen inside
the freeze-dried foam had a size of ca. 5 μm on average, with
the largest sheets sized up to ca. 10 μm, see Figure 2a. Because of the even sublimation
of the aqueous phase during the drying, no apparent density gradient
could be observed in the foam structure, and the volume of the 1 mL
suspension of GO was largely preserved after the freeze-drying was
completed. The preservation and stabilization of the shape, as remnants
from the frozen GO solution, was previously documented as a result
of the high content of oxygen present on the sheets, which also facilitates
a high degree of dispersion the GO in the aqueous state before the
freezing operation.23 The rGO produced
by the low-temperature vacuum oven reduction at 150 °C for 60
min (Figure 2b) was
to some extent also able to maintain its foam structure during the
freeze-drying operation, although the individual graphene sheets were
crumbled at their edges and the overall internal morphology was comprised
of more narrow sheets (ca. 100 nm wide), with the widest sheets reaching
ca. 1.5 μm in width (Figure 2b, inset). Larger sheets associated with the GO sample
were completely absent. Similarly, the rGO from the high-temperature
reduction at 1000 °C for 5 s (Figure 2c) also crumpled in the same fashion, whereas
larger sheets could be observed in the sample (Figure 2c inset). However, a complete collapse of
the foam occurred during the rapid 5 s heat exposure, as seen in the
photograph, resulting in a heavily aggregated material. It should
be noted that all the thermally heat-treated samples had the shape
and porosity of the GO sample in Figure 2a before the thermal treatment.

(a) GO, (b) reduced GO at 150 °C in vacuum (60 min), (c) high-temperature
reduction at 1000 °C (5 s), (d) chemically reduced GO (NaOH buffer),
and (e) chemically reduced GO (NH4OH buffer).

Figure 2d shows
the result of freeze-drying the chemically reduced GO, after using
NaOH as buffering solution at a NaBH4 concentration of
176 mM. The sheets of the rGO were also for the chemically reduced
system severely contracted and crumbled along their edges, indicating
a successful reduction (similar to the thermally treated samples).
The entire foam was however severely contracted after drying (photograph, Figure 2d) and the foam decreased
to ca. 50% of its initial volume before the freeze-drying, that is,
forming a more dense foam in agreement with previous results by Guex
et al.23 In comparison, the GO reduced
using NH4OH as a buffer displayed the most uniform rGO
foam morphology (Figure 2e) among all the reduced samples, with almost a complete absence
of sample shrinkage during the freeze-drying. The small contraction
of the sample was explained by the stabilizing effect that NH4OH had on the sheets in their suspended state. In fact, the
ammonia contributed to a dispersed rGO phase that was not possible
to separate from the solution by centrifugation at 12 100 RCF
for 30 min, that is, as tested before the freeze-drying evaluation.
The individual sheets were however similar in morphology with the
sheets obtained using sodium hydroxide as buffer solution.

XPS of
rGO
Wide scan XPS spectra of the GO and the
rGOs allowed the determination of the oxygen/carbon elemental percentage
proportions (Table 1). The elemental composition of GO included carbon and oxygen at
an atomic percentage of 69.64 and 30.36 atom %, respectively, in line
with recent literature data (C/O value of 2.29).23−25 High-resolution
C 1s spectrum of GO (Figure 3a) exhibited a saddle-like pattern, which is a signature of
a significant oxidation of the GO sheets, which stemmed from their
exfoliation process from the graphite.26 Deconvolution of the C 1s peak in GO disclosed the presence of the
following functional groups: hydroxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy groups,
the latter being the most representative (Table S1, Supporting Information).14 At first
glance, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum of all the reduced GO samples
exhibited a shift from the double peak seen for the pristine GO to
a single sharp peak, which indicates the formation of the sp2 bonding graphene structure.26 The high-resolution
C 1s spectrum obtained from the vacuum-reduced GO sample (150°
for 1 h) is displayed in Figure 3b and shows that the band at 284.6 eV decreased in
intensity, with a proportional increase of the band centered at 286.9
eV, which was assigned to the epoxy (C–O–C) functionalities.26−33 In particular, ensuing from the fitting procedure of the C 1s XPS
spectra, the C–O–C functionalities in the vacuum-reduced
GO sample accounted for the 58.45% of the total, while the nonfunctionalized
carbon represented the 16.45% (Table S1). This was reflected in a C/O value of 4.55 and an oxygen content
of 18.03%. Moreover, a small peak at 290.4 eV was also present in
the spectra. This has previously been ascribed to as a (π →
π*) shakeup satellite peak at ∼290.5 eV, indicating that
delocalized π conjugation, a characteristic of aromatic C structure,
is to some extent restored in heat-treated GO samples.29,30,34 In comparison, the thermal reduction
of GO at 1000 °C for 5 s (Figure 3c) provided an extensive GO reduction in consideration
to carbon and oxygen atomic percentage, which were 83.57 and 16.43
atom %, respectively, yielding a C/O ratio of 5.09 (Table 1).

reduced at 150 °C, (c) thermally reduced GO at 1000 °C,

Samples Determined by XPS
sample	treatment	C	O	Na	B	C/O	
GO1	pristine	69.64	30.36	 	 	2.29

GO5	chemically reduced (NaBH4 + NaOH)	85.24	12.67	2.09	 	6.87	
The reduction using
NaBH4 with ammonia resulted in a
C/O value of 3.89, that is, a decrease in the oxygen content to 19.30
at. % (Table 1), in
agreement with what was reported by Dave et al.24 and a ca. 20% higher concentration of oxygen compared to
the results from the high-temperature reduction. In addition, a higher
percentage of nonfunctionalized carbon, that is, C–C and C=C
(Table S1) was observed (61.1% compared
to 48.7% of GO).

Interestingly, the use of NaBH4 in
combination with
ammonia was very effective in depressing the carboxyl functionalities,
which could not be detected in the sample (Figure 3d, Table S1).
The wide scan XPS spectra of GO reduced with NaOH and NaBH4 showed also a decrease in the surface oxygen content compared with
the pristine GO (Table 1), yielding the highest C/O value among the sample tested in this
work (C/O ratio 6.87). This was supported by the overall view of the
C 1s XPS spectra in Figure 3e, where the main peak at ca 286.7 eV completely disappeared
(only a subtle bump was observed at the same BE) because of the reduction
of both epoxy and carbonyl functionalities (see Table S1).

Overall, the different reduction routes revealed
the thermal treatments
as very efficient, providing high C/O ratios: 4.55 and 5.09 for 60
min under 150 °C (vacuum) and for 5 s at 1000 °C (air),
respectively. However, with the unavoidable aggregation of the sheets
during the elimination of the aqueous phase, only the chemically reduced
GO showing C/O ratios of 3.89 and 6.87 (ammonia and NaOH, respectively)
was selected for further evaluation, thus eliminating the need for
additional drying steps prior to mixing with the NR solutions. Here,
an evaluation of smaller concentration of NaBH4 reducing
agent was performed, for both the ammonia and the NaOH buffer, to
study the evolution of the C/O ratios during the chemical reduction
of GO into rGO, and to ensure that the reduction had reached its maximum
conversion for the employed reaction conditions, see Figure 4.

Figure 4 Change in conductivity
of dried films of the rGO with an increasing
amount of the reduction agent, NaBH4. Dashed red/top line
refer to system reduced by ammonia as buffer, blue/bottom line refers
to when using sodium hydroxide as buffer. All reductions were carried
out as 2 h reactions at 50 °C, followed by 12 h at room temperature.

Figure 4 shows the
increase in conductivity of the chemically reduced rGO as related
to the amount of NaBH4 concentration in the reducing buffer
solution of sodium hydroxide or ammonia. All the reductions were carried
out at 50 °C for 2 h, followed by 12 h at room temperature to
ensure as complete reduction as possible for the given amount of reducing
agent (NaBH4). The concentrations of the buffer solutions
were here equally set to 54 mM to prevent premature decomposition
of the reductant.17 From the results, it
can be seen that the concentration of the reducing agent had a significant
impact on the overall conductive properties of the obtained rGO, showing
a ca. 8 orders of magnitude increase in conductivity compared with
the nonreduced GO sample and a variation in ca. 4 orders of magnitude
depending on the reducing agent concentration. The explanation to
the lower conductivity of 180 S/m for the NaOH-buffered system (as
compared to earlier reported 1500 S/m value also obtained with a 54
mM NaOH buffer)23 was a less extensive
reduction because of the reaction temperature set to 50 °C instead
of 80 °C, in combination with the sodium borohydride concentration
equivalent to only ca. 60 wt % of what was previously reported (300
mM).23 Interestingly, the presence of ammonia
as a buffer solution generated consistently lower values of resistivity
(higher conductivity) for identically formed films. In fact, the ca.
1500 S/m value reached for the 176 mM NaBH4 solution at
50 °C was on a par with the reduction obtained using sodium hydroxide
as buffer solution at 80 °C at a 300 mM concentration of NaBH4, that is, almost twice as high concentration. The results
demonstrate that ammonia assists in more efficient reduction for a
given amount of NaBH4 although with the drawback that the
ammonium hydroxide stabilizes the rGO as a suspended phase (after
the reaction) that could not be separated using a conventional centrifuge
(see morphology section). For comparison, the thermally reduced samples
showed resistivity values corresponding to conductivities of 50 and
12.5 S/m for the vacuum oven reduced at 150 °C and the 1000 °C
(5 s) samples, respectively. However, the values could not be compared
with the filtered samples from chemical reduction because a 4-probe
measurement could not be conducted in a reliable manner over the compressed
samples that were not behaving as continuous films.23 In essence, a considerable portion of the conjugated bonded
oxygen, epoxide, and amine groups present on the pristine GO had in
both aqueous reductions been removed from the surface the GO, which
resulted in a substantial increase in the “sheet-assembly”
conductivities from ca. 8 × 10–6 S/m23 to as much as 1500 S/m.23 However, the ability of ammonia to stabilize the rGO in the aqueous
suspensions to an extent that it was not possible to separate the
rGO from the pitch-black solution resulted in that all the proceeding
experiments were limited to the GO reduced in the presence of NaOH
buffer solution. The GO reduced with the NaOH buffer was accordingly
solvent exchanged into THF, chloroform, toluene, and hexane, via a
first solvent exchange from water to acetone for the purpose of solution
mixing the reduced GO with the dissolved NR solution (using the same
solvents).

Evaluation of Protocol for Solution Blending
the Solvent-Borne
Carbon Fillers with Dissolved NR
Among the solvents tested
only THF and toluene demonstrated satisfactory results with complete
dissolution of the NR in the absence of severe flocculation of the
vulcanization additives before and after the vulcanization. Figure 5 shows the IR spectroscopy
analysis results of the cast dry film of NR obtained using toluene
in absence of any filler phase (after 48 h) together with the raw
rubber material cut from the larger piece delivered to from the manufacturer.
The FT-IR was measured to ensure that the solvent mixing method had
no influence on the preparation on the rubber matrix, that is, affecting
the rubber structure.

Figure 5 FT-IR spectra for the dry cast NR film dissolved in toluene,
raw
material rubber, and toluene (T) spectrum are shown.

It was confirmed that the dissolved and dried rubber
showed identical
spectra with the spectra for the raw rubber material from the manufacturer
(reference sample) and no changes in the peak intensities could be
observed. The FT-IR data also confirmed that the characteristic peaks
of the solvents (at 600–800 cm–1) were not
present in the rubber spectra after drying. The result was repetitive
for the THF sample. The nondestructive nature of the solvent mixing
procedure was further confirmed by including all the vulcanization
components (in absence of the carbon filler phase), followed by drying
and vulcanization at 145 ° C for 1 h and comparing the mechanical
data with a rubber prepared by traditional physical mixing (IM) on
a Banbury unit (followed vulcanization), using tensile testing. The
results revealed strain and stress values for 100, 200, and 300% strain
and showed all values within 10% deviation between samples (see Table 2), and maximum strain values exceeded 550% for stress values
of ca. 20 MPa, which is in agreement with previously reported literature
values.35,36 Only a small increase in the moduli of the
toluene-based samples [as compared to the samples prepared by traditional
mixing (IM)] could be observed (see, Table 2). This difference was suggested to stem
from an improved dissolution of the sulphur phase because toluene
is a better solvent of sulphur, as compared to THF.25,26

Electrical
Properties Post Vulcanization of the Solvent Cast
Rubber with rGO or CNT
The rGO sheets are shown in Figure 6a, whereas the multiwall
CNTs with an average diameter of 6–8 nm and length up to 50
μm are shown in Figure 6b with the same magnification. Figure 6c shows that depending on the solvent used
to prepare the rGO nanocomposites (THF or toluene), the final composite
conductivity varied by ca. 2 orders of magnitude for identically processed
samples. Using toluene resulted in composites always showing higher
conductivity compared with the THF (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Reduced GO and the multiwall CNTs used for the
rubber composites
(a,b) and the normalized conductivity with increasing the wt % of
rGO and CNT in the NR matrix for toluene and THF solvents (c).

The internal morphology of the
nanocomposites was investigated
from freeze-fractured surfaces of the 0.5 wt % rGO composites (Figure S2). The rGO–toluene composite
displayed a completely homogeneous structure, whereas the rGO–THF-based
material showed inclusions embedded in the rubber matrix (Figure S2, left). The structures were likely
to be sulphur crystals remaining intact inside the vulcanized composite
because of the lack of high-shear mastication. Also, because of a
higher solubility of the sulphur particles in toluene, smaller inclusions
were present in the rGO–toluene-based composites (Figure S2, right),35,37 which suggested
that most sulphur had dissolved prior to the solvent casting and vulcanization.
However, the inhomogeneity observed in Figure S2 could also be a combination of the other vulcanization agents
used in the rubber formulation. The composites containing CNTs as
comparison were therefore only prepared from toluene (Figure 6). The difference in conductivity
between rGO–toluene and the CNT–toluene composites was
significant. The CNT-based composites showed the percolation threshold
already at ca. 1 wt % CNT content, while only a small linear increase
in conductivity could be observed up to 7–8 wt % for the rGO
composites. Overall, the more beneficial shape of the high-aspect-ratio
CNT rods resulted in a significantly improved conductivity compared
with the most conductive rGO samples at any given concentration, which
at its most displayed as 5 orders of magnitude difference for the
composites containing 4.4 wt % rGO and CNTs, showing 9.4 × 10–5 and 0.47 S/m, respectively. The highest conductivity
was in relatively good agreement with conductive data reported by
Wang et al. for NR composites of CNTs where cellulose crystals were
used effectively to assist in the formation of percolating networks,
although the percolation threshold was herein observed at lower values.38 A limited early percolation for graphene-containing
polymer nanocomposites has previously been related to possible self-assembly
of graphene sheets into nematic phases below the onset of percolation
because of their flat anisotropic morphology.12,21 In comparison to the data reported by Potts et al. and Kuilla et
al.,18,39,40 who demonstrated
rGO percolation in polymers at 0.2–2 vol % (corresponding to
0.08 to 0.8 wt %), the established conductivity values at 2–4
wt % were however comparatively low because no apparent strong agglomerates
were visible in the rGO composites’ cast from toluene. A 0.1
vol % solution of NR was therefore added to dispersions of rGO in
both toluene and THF to investigate the nature of the interaction
between the rGO and the solvent prior to extraction of the solvents.
The suspension generated a stable black mixture immediately on mixing
the components, which was in contrast to the instability of the rGO
in the pure solvents. The composite suspension remained stable and
showed no phase separation or sedimentation of the rGO phase for 3
months (Figure S3). The strong stabilizing
effect of the rGO sheets (by absorption of the NR isoprene molecules
on the surface of the rGO) may also have limited possibility of having
rGO flake-to-flake contact points, and thus limited conduction. Nonetheless,
this result proves that the addition of low amount of dissolved NR
to rGO dispersed in organic solvents improved the stability of the
nanofiller suspension and may thus be used as a possible surface modification
agent of the nanosheets in nonpolar solvents. Figure 7a shows the surface morphology of the cryo-fractured
samples with 8 wt % rGO. Not only a dominant parallel orientation
of the embedded rGO sheets (Figure 7a) but also 100–200 nm separations of the sheets
with insulating NR between could be observed. Figure 7b shows the morphology associated with the
more randomly oriented CNTs with 8 wt % CNT concentration. In both
cases, the conduction of the composites was sufficient to light a
LED at 8 wt % filler content.

rGO/NR (a) and CNT/NR (b) with 8 wt % filler content. An LED was used
to illustrate the conductivity of the samples.

Dynamic Electrical Properties of the Solvent Cast Rubber with
CNT
The NR nanocomposite with 8 wt % CNT filler was mechanically
tested with simultaneous recording of its electrical resistivity to
investigate how the electrical properties were affected by stretching
the samples (Figure 8). The 8 wt % CNT sample was selected because the concentration was
above the percolation threshold for the CNT nanocomposites and also
because it represented the most conductive composite among the others.
The dynamic electrical and mechanical properties of the 8 wt % rGO/NR
composite is not shown because of its limited flexibility and early
fracture, as a consequence of the challenging dispersion of the rGO
nanofiller in the rubber matrix. Furthermore, the ca. 3 orders of
magnitude lower conductivity presented by the rGO/NR samples was not
sufficient to be measured accurately in the setup designed for this
experiment.

Figure 8 Strain–stress curves for CNT/NR (a) with 8 wt % filler content
and the simultaneous resistivity cycles after each stretching event
for the same CNT/NR sample (b).

The conductive rubber was repeatedly stretched with increasing
deformation until failure (Figure 8a). The maximum strain of 580% at 20 MPa stress was
rather high for a filled NR system, indicating a successful dispersion
of the CNT phase. Previous works on filled NR reported a maximum strain
of ca. 700 and 300%, for 1 and 7% filler contents, respectively.35 The homogeneous dispersion of the CNTs within
the NR matrix was also reflected in the high elastic recovery of the
material deformation for strain values from 25 to 50%, which indicated
that permanent phase segregation zones (volumes) were very small (Figure 8a). For comparison,
the dynamic mechanical stretching of the second most filled rGO/NR
(i.e., 4.4 wt % rGO) is shown in Figure S4. The same cycles for higher rGO contents were not possible to measure
and hence are not shown. The 4.4 wt % rGO/NR composites showed the
inferior distribution of the carbon phase, resulting in a maximum
strain value of 150% and an associated early failure of the composites.
A possible strong interaction between the rGO and the NR molecules
during the vulcanization process because of the known remaining oxygen
functionalities on the surface of the rGO may have also influenced
the flexibility of the sample.23 Moreover,
the rGO had seven times higher estimated surface area than the CNT
filler, as shown in the experimental. Similar mechanical data describing
maximum strain values in the 100–120% region was previously
observed by Lin et al., utilizing a phase segregated graphene/NR composite
morphology to effectively reduce the content of graphene.41 However, the favorable interaction within the
CNTs/NR system is displayed as extensive hysteresis loops for all
the prepared CNT samples. The hysteresis characteristic of the CNT/NR
system is typically referred to as the Müllins effect, reflecting
an extensive formation of new surfaces inside the composites, that
is, as the well-dispersed filler is perturbed in its interaction with
the polymer matrix.42,43 The Mullin effect was observed
for the CNT as well as the rGO filled composites (Figures 8 and S4). Figure S5 shows the absence of the
effect for the neat NR, when stretched under identical conditions.

Figure 8b shows
that although the electrical setup could only be used to accurately
monitor the sample conductivity for repeated stretching up to 200%,
the deformations were always associated with a partial conductivity
loss (increase in resistivity) that remained for the composites, although
their shape was completely recovered. The resistivity of the sample
increased from ca. 5 × 10–5 to 1 × 10–4 ohm m with a 25% elongation from the original length,
followed by an increase in resistivity from 3 × 10–4 to 8 × 10–3 ohm m with the second 50% elongation
cycle. Finally, an increase from 1 × 10–3 to
9.5 × 10–1 ohm m was observed as the sample
was stretched for the third time to 200% of its original length (Figure 8b). The hysteresis
loops showed in Figure 8 are commonly related to the generation of voids in the samples because
of the breakage of the network within the nanocomposite. However,
the void formation could not be the entire mechanism in this case
because the collapse of such voids during the relaxation stage would
promote a partial decrease in the resistivity, as the conductive filler
would come into contact again. Density measurements on the tensile
tested samples were therefore made to check for any residual voids
after tensile testing. No significant density changes were obtained
from the samples before and after the tests. Furthermore, according
to previous works, generation of voids should not affect the resistivity
of the nanocomposite.16,43 Consequently, it is suggested
that partial slippage of the CNT nanofiller and subsequent bending/coiling
processes occurred during relaxation stage. This would permanently
reduce the number of contact points and therefore negatively affect
the electrical conductivity of the sample. It is therefore suggested
that the progressive increase in the hysteresis behavior was related
to the conductive filler (consisting of a distribution of sizes, shapes,
and orientations), wherein the first nanotubes that lost contact were
smaller and completely aligned with the stretching direction, whereas
the larger sized were entangled and lost contact at higher stretching
values. The suggested mechanism is represented in Figure 9. Here, the conductivity remained
constant in the linear stress–strain zone (1), whereas in the
nonlinear zone from the tensile stress cure (2) the conductivity started
to increase linearly (on the log axis) until the maximum elongation
for the current cycle was reached. Finally, when the sample was unloaded,
the conductivity remained constant and did not recover to the initial
value in zone (1). Accordingly, a permanent damage in the percolation
network of the CNTs had at this point occurred. This permanent damage
increased when the sample was exposed to higher strain and further
cycles as shown in Figure 9(3,4).

Figure 9 Conductivity properties of CNT/NR (toluene-based) when
applying
stretching cycles of 50 and 200%. (1,2) illustrate the suggested microstructural
evolution for low strain and (3,4) for high strain after loss in contact
points.

Conclusions
rGO
was herein evaluated in comparison to multiwalled CNTs as a
conductive filler for the preparation of a flexible, and simultaneously
electrically conductive, NR material. To facilitate preparation of
the most conductive NR formulation with highest possible conductivity
of the rGO phase, solvent casting was used to favor the rGO filler
dispersion after a comparison of four different routes to reach highest
possible intrinsic condition of the rGO phase. The most useful reduction
process of the GO sheets was identified as using NaOH as buffer in
aqueous solution and NaBH4 as reducing agent, followed
by the solvent exchange process, to reach sufficient conductivity
to light a LED diode. A strong association of the dissolved NR (polyisoprene)
onto the rGO sheets dispersed in nonpolar solvents was suggested to
partially explain a limited early percolation threshold for the rGO
sheets as compared to CNTs, which only provided 1/1000 of the conduction
compared with an equal amount of CNTs dispersed in an identical manner.
The strong matrix adhesion was further supported by mechanical data,
which showed that the flexibility of the NR matrix decreased from
allowing a 600% maximum strain for a composite containing 8 wt % CNT
to 150% for the composites containing solely 4.4 wt % rGO. In fact,
the 8 wt % rGO/NR composites had lost all flexibility and fractured
in the first strain cycle. The unfavorable shape factor of the rGO
sheets as compared to the CNTs, as an elongated filler conductor,
also must have played a role in the limited percolation of the rGO/NR
composites. On the contrary, the favorable dispersion of the CNTs
allowed preparation of a lightweight and flexible conductor from the
most conductive CNT/NR composite system (displaying an initial 10.5
S/m conductivity), which revealed a permanent loss of its specific
conductivity with each stretching cycle employed (up to 200% strain)
via mechanical testing. The CNT/NR material may therefore find use
in applications such as inexpensive large-strain sensors, or integrated
tyres pressure/vibration sensors, where the combination of flexibility
and conductivity allow for recording repeated large-strain deformation
in terms of its effect on the percolating CNT network.
