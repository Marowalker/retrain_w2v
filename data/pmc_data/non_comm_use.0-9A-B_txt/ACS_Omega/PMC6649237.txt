Monitoring
cyanide levels in water and food samples is crucial.
Herein, we rationally developed a simple and efficient fluorescent
probe for cyanide determination. The probe displayed selective ratiometric
fluorescent response to cyanide. In addition, after treatment with
cyanide, the fluorescence ratios (I509/I466) exhibited a good linearity with
cyanide concentration in the range of 0–60 μM, and the
detection limit was determined to be 0.23 μM (S/N = 3). Significantly, the practical application
demonstrated that the probe was able to quantitatively detect cyanide
concentration in natural water samples. Monitoring of endogenous cyanide
in cherry nut by the probe was also successfully conducted. Notably,
upon fabrication of test strips, the probe could be conveniently utilized
for field measurement of cyanide in bitter almond without relying
on sophistical instruments. Furthermore, the cyanide in potato tissues
was determined for the first time by means of fluorescence imaging.

1 Introduction
Cyanide
ion (CN–) is well known for its extreme
toxicity to human health because of its close interaction with ferric
iron atoms in metalloenzymes, which can inhibit important biological
processes associated with oxidative metabolism and cellular respiration.1 However, despite their toxicity, cyanides are
widely used in a variety of industries, including mining, electroplating,
metal cleaning, pharmaceuticals, plastics, etc.2 The cyanide-contaminated industrial waste may pollute water
resources, thereby posing great threat to human health. Moreover,
cyanogenesis is widespread in plant species, including a large number
of important food crop species, such as sorghum, cassava, almonds,
bamboo shoot, white clover, sprouting potato, etc.3−5 In cyanogenic
plants, cyanide compounds are naturally generated via enzymatic hydrolysis
of cyanogenic glycosides when the plant cells are ruptured.6 Cyanide exposures to human beings frequently
occur by consumption of raw or improperly processed cyanogenic food
and plants,7−9 which often leads to death or permanent neurologic
deficits such as the paralytic disease recognized as konzo.10,11 Thereby, the development of effective methods for detecting cyanide
levels in water and food samples is of high demand.

Various
strategies for detecting cyanide have been developed, including
mass spectrometry,12 electrochemistry,13 ion chromatography,14 Raman spectrometry,15 flow injection,16 colorimetry,17 and
fluorescent probe. Among these strategies, fluorescent probe seems
to be most promising owing to its distinguished features of high selectivity
and sensitivity, fast response time, and technical simplicity.18 Recently, many fluorescent probes for sensing
cyanide have been constructed by virtue of the high binding ability
of cyanide to metal ions (Co2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, Zn2+),19−23 H+,24 and boronic
acid derivatives.25 Additionally, cyanide
fluorescent probes have been developed on the basis of the specific
nucleophilic reactivity of cyanide to electrophilic double bonds,
such as C=C,26 C=O,27 C=N,28 C=S,29 or C=N+.30 Nevertheless, most of the reported fluorescent probes for
determining cyanide in water samples and food samples only displayed
fluorescence turn-on response.31−37 A major limitation of the fluorescence turn-on probe is that the
signal output is vulnerable to factors such as excitation intensity,
probe concentration, and instrumental efficiency. By contrast, a ratiometric
fluorescent probe can effectively eliminate the above-mentioned limitations
and consequently provide more accurate analysis.38,39 In addition, the preparation of the reported probes generally needs
sophisticated synthesis procedures. From a wide application perspective,
fluorescent probes with simple synthetical procedures are favorable.
Therefore, the development of a simple and easy-to-prepare ratiometric
fluorescent probe for determining cyanide in water and food samples
would be of great significance.

To this end, we rationally designed
and synthesized a novel fluorescent
probe, compound 1, for sensing cyanide in water samples
and food samples. In probe 1, a naphthalene fluorescence
dye was employed as fluorophore, while a dicyanovinyl group functioned
as the specific sensing reactive unit. Remarkably, probe 1 displayed ratiometric fluorescent response to the cyanide with high
selectivity and sensitivity, making probe 1 usable to
precisely sense cyanide. Furthermore, probe 1 was easily
prepared from the commercially available materials in only one step
with high yield. The simple synthetic procedure is conducive to the
wide application of probe 1. Importantly, the practical
application experiments established that probe 1 was
successfully applied for quantitatively determining cyanide in various
water and food samples.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
As
shown in Scheme 1,
probe 1 was easily synthesized in only one step. Condensation
of 2-naphthalenecarboxaldehyde and propanedinitrile in the presence
of zinc chloride afforded probe 1 in 84.3% yield. The
simple synthetic procedure significantly lowers the cost of probe
preparation, which contributes to the wide application of the probe.
The product has been fully characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry,
and elemental analysis.

Scheme 1 Synthetical Procedures of Probe 1 and its Reaction with
Cyanide Affording Compound 1-CN
2.2 Optical Responses to Cyanide
To study
the optical properties of probe 1 with cyanide, the fluorescence
spectra were firstly investigated in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer/dimethylformamide
(DMF) (4:6 v/v, pH 7.4). As shown in Figure 1a, probe 1 (20 μM) itself
exhibited intense fluorescence emission at 466 nm. Upon adding increasing
amount of cyanide, the fluorescence emission at 466 nm was gradually
attenuated and a new fluorescence emission centered at 509 nm was
increased. Meanwhile, an isoemission point was noted at 482 nm, implying
that the sensing reaction is a clear process. The red-shifted fluorescence
response made probe 1 sense cyanide in ratiometric manners
that can effectively reduce the potential interference factors from
changes in excitation intensity, probe distribution, and instrumental
efficiency. In the absence of cyanide, the fluorescence intensity
ratio (I509/I466) of probe 1 was calculated to be 0.49. With addition
of increasing amount of cyanide, the ratios (I509/I466) were gradually augmented
and became constant when the amount of cyanide reached 80 μM
(Figure 1b). At this
point, the ratio (I509/I466) was calculated to be 1.66. As depicted in Figure S1, the ratios (I509/I466) also displayed a good
linearity with cyanide concentration in the range of 0–60 μM
(Y = 0.48646 + 0.01771X, R2 = 0.99782), implying that probe 1 can be potentially used for quantitatively detecting cyanide. The
detection limit was found to be 0.23 μM (S/N = 3), which was below the maximum allowable cyanide concentration
(1.9 μM) in drinking water set by World Health Organization
(WHO).40 In addition, after reaction with
cyanide, the fluorescence color of probe 1 gave obvious
changes from blue to green (Figure 1c). Moreover, the photostability study showed that
probe 1 was stable in the buffer solution upon irradiating
at 297 nm for 30 min (Figure S2). The effect
of water volume fraction on probe 1 sensing cyanide was
also explored. Probe 1 can be used for sensing cyanide
even in the solution with 70% water (Figure S3).

Figure 1 (a) Changes in fluorescence spectra (λex = 297
nm) of probe 1 (20 μM) with various amounts of
cyanide (0–140 μM); (b) changes in fluorescence emission
ratios (I509/I466) of probe 1 (20 μM) with various amounts of cyanide
(0–140 μM); (c) fluorescence color changes of probe 1 (20 μM) before and after addition of cyanide (140
μM); and (d) changes in UV/vis spectra of probe 1 (20 μM) with various amounts of cyanide (0–140 μM).
The error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3).

The absorption spectra of probe 1 upon titration with
cyanide solution were recorded. Probe 1 displayed an
intense absorption centered at 332 nm and a shoulder absorption at
279 nm (Figure 1d).
Upon progressively adding cyanide, the absorption peaks at 332 and
279 nm gradually decreased. Meanwhile, a weak absorption at 344 nm
and an absorption at 278 nm were finally formed. Correspondingly,
after treatment with cyanide, the solution color of probe 1 under visible light changed from yellow to colorless (Figure S4).

2.3 Selectivity
Studies
The specific
nature of probe 1 to cyanide was inspected. Introducing
140 μM of various anions (CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, HCO3–, NO3–, SCN–, CH3COO–, HSO3–, ClO4–) and
biological molecules (glucose, Gly, Cys) into probe 1 solution gave rise to almost no fluorescence intensity ratio (I509/I466) response
(Figure 2). The obvious
ratio (I509/I466) changes only occurred when the cyanide was added. Moreover, naked
eye detection was carried out. Under the illumination of UV light,
the solution of probe 1 showed specific fluorescence
color change to cyanide (Figure 2, inset). The sensing behaviors of probe 1 to cyanide in the presence of other species were also studied. The
other species hardly intervened the response of probe 1 to cyanide (Figure S5). These evidences
elaborated that probe 1 displayed highly selective response
to cyanide.

(b) CN–; (c) Cl–; (d) SCN–; (e) HSO3–; and (f) Cys.

2.4 Response
Time and Effect of pH
The
sensing rate of probe 1 with cyanide was monitored by
fluorescent spectra (Figure 3). After treatment with 140 μM cyanide, pronounced fluorescence
intensity variations were noted at 509 and 466 nm, respectively. Notably,
the intensities can reach constant within 1 min. The rapid response
toward cyanide is beneficial for the detection of cyanide in real
time. The fluorescence responses of probe 1 to cyanide
under different pH values were measured. In the absence of cyanide,
the fluorescence intensity ratio of probe 1 showed negligible
variation in the pH range of 2.3–10.1 (Figure S6), denoting that probe 1 was stable
in the solution under these pH values. However, in the presence of
cyanide, the fluorescence intensity ratio of probe 1 drastically
enhanced when the pH value of solution was higher than 6.26. Therefore,
probe 1 is suitable for the detection of cyanide under
neutral and alkaline pH conditions.

Figure 3 Time-dependent changes in the fluorescence
intensities recorded
at 466 and 509 nm observed upon treatment of probe 1 (20
μM) with cyanide (140 μM).

2.5 Sensing Reaction Mechanism
To investigate
the sensing reaction mechanism of probe 1 with cyanide,
the sensing reaction product of probe 1 with cyanide, 1-CN, was isolated. The fluorescence excitation spectra and
fluorescence emission spectra of 1-CN were identical
with cyanide-treated probe 1 (Figure S7). Therefore, 1-CN was responsible for the fluorescence
properties of probe 1 with cyanide. Then, 1-CN was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
In the 1H NMR spectra of free probe 1, the
peak at 8.28 ppm corresponds to the vinylic proton of dicyanovinyl
group (Ha) (Figure 4). Nevertheless, in 1-CN, the signal of vinylic
proton at 8.28 ppm disappeared. Concomitantly, two new signals appeared
at 4.63 ppm (Hb) and 4.32 ppm (Hc). Moreover,
in the 13C NMR spectra of probe 1, the signals
for the two vinylic carbons of dicyanovinyl group were located at
159 and 82 ppm, respectively. The two signals were shifted to 39 and
29 ppm correspondingly in the 13C NMR spectra of 1-CN (Figure S8). Therefore, the
sensing reaction of probe 1 with cyanide is the nucleophilic
addition of cyanide to the β-position of dicyanovinyl moiety
in probe 1. Furthermore, the formation of cyanide adduct 1-CN was confirmed by ESI mass spectrometry, where a major
peak at m/z 230.01 is assigned to
[1-CN]− (Figure S9).

in CDCl3.

2.6 Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
To get insight into the optical response of probe 1 to cyanide, probe 1 and its cyanide adduct 1-CN were examined by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)
calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G** level using Gaussian 09 program.
For probe 1, the electron distribution and energy levels
of the frontier molecular orbitals are illustrated in Figure 5. In the ground-state geometry,
the HOMO-1 → LUMO transition (oscillator strength f = 0.7296) and HOMO → LUMO + 1 transition (f = 0.3082) in probe 1 were allowable. And it is evident
that the HOMO-1 → LUMO transition was the intramolecular charge
transfer process from naphthalene moiety to the dicyanovinyl moiety.
This transition was responsible for the UV/vis absorption peak of
probe 1 at 332 nm (Figure 1d). In contrast, the HOMO → LUMO + 1 transition
corresponded to the π–π* local transition in naphthalene
moiety, which contributed to the UV/vis absorption peak of probe 1 at 279 nm (Figure 1d). In the first excited-state geometry, the LUMO →
HOMO transition is allowable (f = 0.1679), which
was the reason for the fluorescence of probe 1 at 466
nm (Figure 1a). The
frontier molecular orbitals of 1-CN are displayed in Figure S10. In the ground-state geometry, it
is clear that the HOMO → LUMO + 3 transition (f = 0.4488) is electron transfer from the naphthalene moiety to the
1,1,2-tricyano ethane moiety, which was responsible for UV/vis absorption
peak of 1-CN at 278 nm (Figure 1d). In the first excited-state geometry of 1-CN, the LUMO → HOMO-1 transition (f = 0.4435) is attributed to the emission of 1-CN at
509 nm (Figure 1a).
Therefore, the optical properties of probe 1 and 1-CN have been theoretically revealed.

and fluorescence emissions of probe 1: the molecular

were studied on the basis of optimized ground-state geometry, and
the fluorescence emission was studied on the basis of the optimized
geometry of the excited state. Water was employed as the solvent (PCM
model). IC represents internal conversion and CT represents conformation
transformation. Excitation and radiative processes are denoted as
the solid arrow, and the nonradiative processes are denoted as the
dotted arrow.

2.7 Practical
Application
Cyanide in
the industrial waste could possibly be dumped into water and pollute
the water resource. Thus, probe 1 was applied for sensing
cyanide in the natural water samples (tap water, Yangtze River water,
and pond water). As shown in Table 1, cyanides in these natural water samples were not
detected. When different concentrations of cyanide were further added
into the natural water samples, probe 1 was able to measure
the concentrations of cyanide with good recovery (Table 1). These studies established
that probe 1 is capable of quantitatively determining
cyanide levels in the natural water samples.

In cyanogenic food plants, the cyanide
is generated by enzymatic
hydrolysis of cyanogenic glycoside when their tissues are damaged.
Thus, we further explored the potential application of probe 1 for determining cyanide in various food samples. First,
probe 1 was utilized to detect cyanide in cherry,41 a popular fruit. The cherry flesh extract samples
and cherry nut extract samples were prepared from commercially available
cherry. Then, 0.5 mL of the prepared extract samples were added to
the probe 1 solution. As shown in Figure 6, no notable fluorescence variation was noted
in the probe 1 solution with cherry flesh extract sample,
while pronounced fluorescence response was observed in probe 1 with cherry nut extract sample. These inferred that the
cyanide was mainly generated in the cherry nut but not in cherry flesh.

Figure 6 Fluorescence
emission spectra of 20 μM probe 1 (black square
solid), probe 1 with 0.5 mL of cherry
flesh extract sample (blue circle solid), and probe 1 with 0.5 mL cherry nut extract sample (bright green triangle up
solid). The excitation wavelength was 297 nm. Inset: visual fluorescence
color changes of 20 μM probe 1, probe 1 with cherry flesh extract sample, and probe 1 with
cherry nut extract sample under illumination of a handheld UV lamp.

Subsequently, to investigate the
practical application of probe 1, test strips were prepared
by immersing filter papers into
DMF solution of probe 1 (0.1 M) and then drying them
in air. Then, the test strips were dipped into solution with different
volumes of bitter almond extract samples to determine the endogenous
cyanide in bitter almond. As shown in Figure 7, the fluorescence colors of test strips
gradually changed from blue to green with increasing volume of bitter
almond extract samples (Figure 7c–f), denoting that probe 1 test strips
were able to determine the different concentrations of endogenous
cyanide in bitter almond extract samples. The present sensing strategy
is appealing because it does not rely on elaborate instrumentation
and can be used for field measurement.

5 mL of KCN solution (100 μM)
(b), probe 1 test strip dipped into 5 mL of solution
with 0 mL (c), 0.1 mL (d), 0.2 mL (e), and 0.6 mL (f) of bitter almond
sample. The photos were taken under illumination of a handheld UV
lamp.

Fluorescence imaging of plant
tissues by probe 1 is
another avenue to determine the endogenous cyanide in food samples.
Potato, a vegetable food, was chosen as the proof of concept. The
nonsprouting and sprouting potato were cut into fresh slices at room
temperature. After incubated with probe 1 solution, the
slices were used for fluorescence imaging by a laser confocal scanning
microscope. As shown in Figure 8a, strong fluorescence in the blue channel was observed in
the nonsprouting potato slice, displaying that probe 1 was able to permeate into potato tissues. In addition, there was
almost no fluorescence in the green channel. Thus, no cyanide was
generated in the nonsprouting potato. However, in the sprouting potato
slice, strong fluorescence in the green channel (Figure 8e) and almost no fluorescence
in the blue channel was observed (Figure 8d), inferring that the cyanide was produced
in the sprouting potato. Moreover, when the sprouting potato slice
was preincubated with cyanide inhibitor AgNO3 solution,42 and then stained with probe 1,
strong fluorescence was noted in the blue channel (Figure 8g) and weak fluorescence was
detected in the green channel (Figure 8h), indicating that fluorescence response in sprouting
potato is a cyanide-dependent event. It should be mentioned that this
is the first example of monitoring cyanide levels in potato tissues
by means of fluorescence imaging.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we rationally constructed a novel fluorescent probe,
compound 1, for determining cyanide concentration in
natural water samples and food samples. In probe 1, the
naphthalene dye was utilized as fluorophore and the dicyanovinyl group
was employed as the specific recognition site. Notably, the probe
can be readily synthesized in only one step with high yield, which
is beneficial to the wide application of probe 1. Upon
treatment with cyanide, probe 1 displayed ratiometric
fluorescent response with high sensitivity and selectivity, and the
detection limit was determined to be 0.23 μM (S/N = 3). The sensing reaction mechanism was fully
investigated. The optical response of probe 1 to cyanide
was rationally confirmed by TD-DFT calculation. Importantly, probe 1 was successfully applied for determining cyanide in water
and food samples, such as natural water, cherry, almond, and potato.
We believe that the novel and simple ratiometric fluorescent probe
developed in this work will be widely used for determining cyanide
levels in various water and food samples.

4.2 Measurement
Procedures
First, the
stock solution of fluorescent probe 1 (5 × 10–4 M) was dissolved in DMF and the stock solutions of
various anions or biological molecules (1 × 10–3 M) were dissolved in water. Then, the test solution of probe 1 (20 μM) with various testing species in 20 mM potassium
phosphate buffer/DMF (v/v 4:6, pH 7.4) was prepared by placing 0.2
mL of the probe 1 stock solution, 2.8 mL of DMF, and
an appropriate aliquot of each anion or biological molecule stock
into a 5 mL volumetric flask, and then diluting the solution to 5
mL with potassium phosphate buffer solution. The resulting solution
was shaken and stood at room temperature for 5 min before measuring
the absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra.

4.3 Determination of Cyanide in Natural Water
Samples
The natural water samples were obtained from tap
water, Yangtze River water, and pond water (from the campus of Jiangsu
University). The determination of cyanide concentration in the water
samples was conducted by addition of 0.1 mL of water sample to a solution
containing 0.2 mL of probe 1 stock solution (5 ×
10–4 M) and 2.8 mL of DMF in a 5 mL volumetric flask
and then diluting the solution to 5 mL with 20 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). After the resulting solution was incubated at room
temperature for 5 min, the fluorescence emission spectra (λex = 297 nm) were recorded. On the basis of fluorescence intensity
ratio (I509/I466) and the equation provided in Figure S1, the cyanide concentrations in the three natural water samples were
quantitatively determined. Subsequently, different concentrations
of cyanide (3.0 × 10–4 and 2.0 × 10–3 M) were added into three natural water samples. Then,
the concentrations of cyanide in these natural water samples were
determined by the same method.

4.4 General
Procedure for Preparation of Food
(Cherry Flesh, Cherry Nut, and Bitter Almond) Extract Samples
The food samples were purchased from a local market (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu
Province, P.R. China). As indicated by the manufactures, the cherry
was originated from Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, and the bitter
almond was from Baoding, Hebei Province, China.

The procedure
for the preparation of food extract samples was according to a reported
procedure.36 Food samples (10 g, cherry
flesh, cherry nut, or bitter almond) were well crushed and pulverized,
and then stored in a sealed flask for 60 min at room temperature to
release the cyanide. After that, 10 mL of water and 50 mg of NaOH
were added to the flask. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred
for 5 min. The obtained mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm
for 10 min. The supernatant as food extract sample was used for further
analysis.

4.5 Determination of Endogenous Cyanide in Cherry
Flesh Extract Sample and Cherry Nut Extract Sample
Cherry
flesh extract sample or cherry nut extract sample (0.5 mL) was added
into a solution of 0.2 mL of probe 1 stock solution (5
× 10–4 M) and 2.8 mL of DMF in a 5 mL volumetric
flask, and then diluting the solution to 5 mL with 20 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The resulting solution was shaken well
and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before recording the spectra.

4.6 Determination of Endogenous Cyanide in Bitter
Almond Extract Sample by Test Strips
The test strips were
prepared by immersing filter papers into DMF solution of probe 1 (0.1 M) and then drying them in air. The obtained test strips
were dipped into 5 mL solution of DMF with different volumes of bitter
almond extract sample (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.6 mL). After 5 min, the test
strips were lifted out, dried in air, and then observed under a 365
nm UV lamp.

4.7 Determination of Endogenous
Cyanide in Potato
by Fluorescence Imaging
Nonsprouting and sprouting potato
were washed and sliced into 0.5–1 mm thick disks. Then, the
slices were incubated with probe 1 (50 μM) in DMF
medium for 30 min at 37 °C. After that, the slices were washed
with PBS three times. For the control experiment, the sprouting potato
slices were pretreated with 100 μM AgNO3 solution
for 15 min, and then the slices were further incubated with 50 μM
probe 1 solution for 30 min. Finally, fluorescence imaging
was conducted by a laser confocal scanning microscope. The blue channel
was set at 425–475 nm with excitation at 364 nm, and the green
channel was set at 500–550 nm with excitation at 364 nm.
