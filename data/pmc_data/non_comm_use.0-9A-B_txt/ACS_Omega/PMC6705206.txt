Upon
freezing aqueous sucrose at temperatures higher than the eutectic
point (−14 °C in this case), two phases, that is, ice
and freeze concentrated solution (FCS), are spontaneously separated.
FCS forms through-pore fluidic channels when thin ice septum is prepared
from aqueous sucrose. Total FCS volume depends on temperature but
is independent of the initial sucrose concentration. This allows us
to control the size of the FCS channels simply by changing the initial
sucrose concentration as long as temperature is kept constant. In
this paper, we show that the size of the channel, which has a layered
structure, can be controlled in a range from 50 nm to 3 μm.
Thus, the FCS channel is suitable for size-sorting of micro- and nanoparticles.
We discuss the size-sorting efficiency of the channel and demonstrate
the separation of particles with different sizes.

Introduction
Size-selective separation
of particles is an important task in
various fields, including micro/nano-science/technology, life science,
environmental chemistry, and industrial applications. Particle separation
has been conducted using field flow fractionation (FFF),1 hydrodynamic chromatography,2−4 electrophoresis,5−7 dielectrophoresis,6,8,9 and
so forth. In these separation methods, physical fields are utilized
to induce different distributions of particles according to their
physical properties, such as sizes and charges. For example, an electric
field has been used in a number of methods, such as FFF, electrophoresis,
and dielectrophoresis. Also, flow field plays an important role in
FFF and hydrodynamic chromatography to differentiate the elution of
particles. Other physical fields employed for particle separation
include magnetic,10 acoustic,11,12 and thermal fields.1 The recent development
of micro/nanofluidic devices has put complicated on-line procedures
at our disposal, including mixing and separating streamlines in the
micrometer range and incorporating physical interactions of particles
with structures fabricated in a channel.5,6,13−17 However, new principles and concepts for particle separation are
still required because of the limited separation efficiency and versatility
of the methods currently available.

We have reported various
separation and reaction systems using
frozen aqueous solutions.18 When an aqueous
solution is frozen, solutes are expelled from ice and concentrated
in a freeze concentrated solution (FCS). The FCS coexists with ice
at temperatures higher than the eutectic point, and its volume is
predictable from the equilibrium freezing point depression curve of
the system. Thus, we can control the volume of the FCS by changing
the temperature and solute concentration.19−23 Another critical point in the utilization of an FCS
for analytical purposes is the morphological control of the FCS. As
noted above, although the total volume of the FCS is thermodynamically
known, thermal equilibrium does not predict its morphology, which
depends on various factors, such as the freezing rate, solute distribution,
and the physicochemical nature of the FCS. In our previous work, the
dendritic growth of ice was confirmed when an aqueous sucrose solution
was frozen. Straight channel-like grooves are formed between ice dendrites
and are filled with the FCS.24 This structure
is highly reproducible if the same freezing conditions are employed.

The grooves formed on the ice surface act as fluidic channels suitable
for size-sorting of nano/microparticles.24 The most remarkable property of this channel is that the groove
width can be controlled in a range from 200 nm to 4 μm with
high reproducibility, simply by changing the working temperature.
When the groove width becomes smaller than the size of a particle
introduced therein, the migration of particles is blocked by the physical
interference from the ice walls of the groove. This concept was extended
to the evaluation of the interaction of antifreeze proteins with the
ice surface.25 In this method, particles
were spontaneously introduced in the grooves by a freezing aqueous
particle suspension because they are expelled from the ice phase.
Although this approach is effective for evaluating the size of a particle
and its interaction with the ice walls, particle separation or fractionation
is severely restricted because the channel is not accessed from outer
solutions; it is impossible to move particles in and out of the channel.
In this paper, we extend this concept to the size-selective separation
of micro/nanoparticles, which facilitates the application of freeze-control
of channel dimensions in the micro- to nanometer range.

Results and Discussion
Channel
Size and Its Control
Figure 1 compares a fluorescence microscopic image
of the ice septum (csucini = 3.38 wt %) formed immediately after
its preparation by freezing at −14.0 °C with that after
annealing at −5.0 °C (Figure 1B) and −3.0 °C (Figure 1C). Fluorescein was added to
visualize the FCS. While no clear FCS structures are seen in the septum
immediately after freezing, channel-like veins filled with the FCS
are developed after annealing. The development of channel structures
can be explained by the growth of dendritic ice crystals. All of the
measurements were performed at −4.0 °C, at which the concentration
of sucrose in the FCS is 38.1 wt % (=1.3 M) and its viscosity is 12.7
mPa s. Our previous work indicates that the viscosity of the FCS confined
in ice is higher than the value determined in bulk.24 Highly viscous FCS enhances the fluctuation of the interface
and causes the dendritic growth of ice.26,27 This leads
to the formation of long channels, which are filled by the FCS, as
found on the ice surface in our previous work. Bogdan et al.28 indicated that a continuous ice framework rather
than isolated ice crystals is formed when an aqueous sucrose is frozen.
Their microscopic observation showed that the FCS is present between
ice twigs. A similar phenomenon occurs inside the frozen aqueous sucrose
and allows the formation of long through-channels in the ice septum.
It is obvious that the long channel formation is related to the FCS
viscosity because through-channel formation was rarely confirmed in
frozen aqueous glycerol, although the results are not shown. The FCS
viscosity for aqueous glycerol at −4.0 °C is 4.25 mPa
s,29 which is one-third of that in frozen
sucrose. Thus, the FCS viscosity is a critical factor for through-channel
formation in frozen aqueous solution.

wt %. FCS is visualized by adding fluorescein to the original solution.
(A) Immediately after preparation at −14.0 °C. (B) After
annealing at −5.0 °C for 15 min. (C) After annealing at
−3.0 °C for 15 min. Although no channel structures are
seen in (part A), channel-like FCS structures become obvious after
annealing in (parts B and C). In particular, clear structures are
seen after annealing at a higher temperature in (part C).

The total volume of the FCS is a function of the initial
concentration
of the main solute (sucrose in the present case, csucini) and
temperature. In contrast, the concentration of the FCS (csucFCS) is
a function of temperature but independent of csucini. Bogdan et
al. showed that the ice framework is immersed in FCS1 and
more concentrated FCS2 is present between ice dendrite
twigs for csucini = 10–40 wt %.28 Because the present csucini was lower than 3.38 wt %
(=100 mM), the FCS is present between ice twigs and no sucrose concentration
gradient exists. The freezing depression curve for the sucrose/water
system is known, as shown in Figure S1.30 At temperatures above the eutectic point (−14
°C), the channels are filled with the FCS with the concentration
of csucFCS, which can be read from the freeze depression curve. In
this work, the working temperature was kept constant at −4.0
°C, while csucini was varied in the range of 0.034–3.38
wt %. Thus, the FCS volume can be controlled by changing csucini because csucFCS is constant at 1.3 M.

The shape of the FCS-channel cross section
was evaluated by confocal
fluorescence microscopy. Figure 2 summarizes micrographs of the cross-sections of the
channels fabricated using csucini = 0.68 wt %. Fluorescein was contained
in the FCS for visualization. Although fluorescence imaging does not
provide the proper morphologies of the channels because of light penetration
into ice and scattering at the ice/FCS interface, all of the channel
cross-sections have large aspect ratios, that is, rectangular or oval.
This can be understood by considering the origin of the FCS channel
formation in the frozen aqueous solution. Figure S2 schematically shows the FCS channel development between
two ice dendrites. The FCS is sandwiched between two facets of ice
dendrites facing each other and forms a thin layer. The ice crystal
size after ripening is typically in the range of 100 μm.19,31,32 Thus, the typical length and
width of the FCS channel are in this dimensional range. As shown later,
particles often pass through other particles in the same channel,
suggesting that the channel has a large width orthogonal to the direction
of particle migration. Also, our electrochemical measurements indicated
that the FCS forms a thin layer on the electrode surface.33 Thus, the cross-section with a high aspect ratio
is reasonably explained.

Figure 2 FCS channel structures. (A) Micrograph of ice
septum prepared with csucini = 0.68 wt %. (B) Cross-sections of
the FCS channels across the red
line shown in (part A). Obvious channel structures are seen on the
right side of septum (part A). The cross-section of the channel is
possibly rectangular with high-aspect ratios as shown in (part B).

The passage of particles through the ice septum
was observed using
the fluorescence microscope. The passage of particles of various sizes
(diameter, d = 50 nm to 3 μm) through the ice
septum prepared from the sucrose solution of csucini = 0.034–3.38
wt % was studied. The ice septum was prepared with the same csucini at least three times, and the passage of more than ten particles
through each septum was tested. The migration and passage of relatively
large particles (d ≥ 0.5 μm) were directly
observed using a microscope. The passage of smaller particles through
the ice septum was confirmed by measuring the fluorescence intensity
at the outlets of the channels. The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. Table 1 summarizes the confirmation of the passage
for particles with d = 50 nm–3 μm. For
example, the ice septum prepared with csucini = 3.38 wt
% allowed all of the particles tested to pass through the septum.
In contrast, when csucini decreased to 1.70 wt %, particles
with d = 3 μm became impassable, whereas smaller
ones remained passable. Similarly, the threshold particle size became
smaller as csucini decreased.

Based on the above observations,
the channel thickness (t) was estimated that determines
the size selectivity of
the FCS channel. When a particle passes through a channel, the channel
thickness, t, is larger than the particle diameter.
In contrast, when the particle passage is not confirmed, the channel
thickness should be smaller than the particle diameter. Figure 3 shows that there is a linear
relationship between log t and log csucini. The
slope is almost unity, suggesting that t is proportional
to csucini. As discussed above, the major channels are formed between
two ice crystal facets. When csucini increases, the FCS grows and its volume linearly increases with csucini. In contract, the size of ice becomes smaller. However, the shrinkage
of ice is much smaller than the development of the FCS. For example,
an increase in csucini from 0.034 to 0.34 wt % results in a ten-fold
increase in the FCS volume but a 0.7% decrease in the ice volume.
Similarly, an increase in csucini from 0.34 to 3.38 wt % results in
a ten-fold increase in the FCS volume but only a 7% decrease in the
ice volume. Thus, a change in the ice volume is much less sensitive
to the csucini change than that in the FCS. Because the
width and length of the channel are determined by the size of ice,
as shown in Figure S2, these dimensions
can be regarded as almost constant during a change in csucini. Therefore,
a change in csucini has an impact only on t, which increases linearly with csucini as a result. Thus, the critical
channel size, that is, thickness t, which determines
size selectivity, is proportional to csucini. This allows
us to control the channel dimension in a simple way, that is, by adjusting csucini.

Electric Field in the Channel
Figure 4 shows the dependence of the migration rate
of a 3 μm particle in the FCS channel on csucini. The voltage
for these measurements was kept at 40 V; the average electric field
was 8.0 × 103 V m–1. The migration
rate decreased with a decrease in csucini and became zero between csucini = 2.38 and 2.71 wt %. Although Table 1 indicates that the threshold csucini is in the
range of 1.7–3.38 wt % for a 3 μm particle, Figure 4 gives a more specific
threshold csucini value.

Figure 4 Effect of csucini on the migration
rate (v) of a 3 μm particle in the FCS channel.

If the electrophoretic force (Fel)
is balanced by the Stokes resistance (FSt), the following relationship can be derived  where E is the electric field,
η is the viscosity of the medium (=12.7 mPa s in the present
case), r is the radius of a particle, and v is the electrophoretic velocity. When a 3 μm particle
electrophoretically migrates at v = 1.6 × 10–5 m s–1 (csucini = 3.38 wt
%), Fel acting on it is estimated to be
5.8 pN. The electrophoretic rate decreased to 9.8 × 10–6 and 8.3 × 10–6 m s–1 at csucini = 3.05 and 2.71 wt %, respectively, and then to zero at csucini = 2.38 wt %. Therefore, the interaction force with the ice wall
increases by 2.3, 2.8, and 5.8 pN as csucini decreases
from 3.38 to 3.05, 2.71, and 2.38 wt %, respectively.

Microchip
electrophoresis of a 3 μm particle indicated that
its mobility is 4.79 × 10–9 m s–2 V–1 in 38.1 wt % aqueous sucrose at −4.0
°C. Thus, v under an electric field of 8.0 ×
103 V m–1 is 3.83 × 10–5 m s–1 in free solutions, in which no physical
interference from the channel walls is imposed on the particle. However,
according to Figure 4, v at csucini 3.38 wt % is 1.5 × 10–5 m s–1, which is smaller than the corresponding v in the free solution. There are three possibilities for
the origin of this discrepancy: (1) the particle migration is hindered
even at csucini = 3.38 wt %; (2) the local electric field
strength is smaller than the average value of 8.0 × 103 V m–1; and (3) an electro-osmotic flow in the
opposite direction reduces the apparent electrophoretic mobility.

As shown in Figure 1, channels fabricated in the ice septum were not straight but rather
tortuous. The electric path length is thus longer than the interval
between two electrodes, and, in addition, the local electric field
strength is different for different channels because the area of the
channel cross-section (w·t in Figure S2) also varies from one channel to the
other; although t can be controlled by csucini and
temperature, as discussed above, w cannot be controlled
by these parameters. Thus, the local electric field cannot be known
from the apparent migration rate of the particle, and, also the migration
rates of particles measured in different channels cannot be compared
directly.

The migration ratios of two different particles in
the same channel
were studied to cancel the local electric field effect. Figure 5 shows snapshots of the passage
of particles with different sizes through the same channel. We can
confirm that a 1 μm particle passes through a 3 μm particle
and then migrates ahead. In this figure, the migration of relatively
large particles is shown to demonstrate the observation of simultaneous
passage of the particles in the same channel. Because the separation
of nanoparticles would be of more significance in nanotech applications,
the migration ratio of 100 and 300 nm particles was studied in the
FCS channel prepared with csucini = 0.68–3.38 wt % in detail.

Figure 5 Simultaneous
migration of different particles (1 and 3 μm)
in the FCS channel prepared with csucini = 3.38 wt %. Arrows show
the time lapse. Orange and red circles indicate the positions of 3
and 1 μm particles, respectively. The FCS channel runs along
the thick blue curve.

When the contribution
from the electro-osmotic flow is taken into
account, the ratio of the apparent migration rates is given by  where subscripts denote the size
of the particle
and the superscripts ep and eo represent electrophoresis and electro-osmosis,
respectively. Because both electrophoretic and electro-osmotic velocities
are proportional to the electric field strength, using the ratio of
apparent electrophoretic migration rates allows the cancellation of E. The migration of particles was measured in the ice septum,
which was prepared with csucini = 0.68, 1.70, and 3.38 wt %. Septum
preparation was repeated several times for each csucini, and
the migration rates of the particles in the same FCS channel were
determined. The migration data are summarized in Table S1, where the average values of migration rates for
0.1 and 0.3 μm particles (v100app and v300app) are listed
with standard deviations. The ratios (v300app/v100app) are
plotted in Figure 6. The ratio of the electrophoretic mobility of 100 and 300 nm particles
(μ300free/μ100free), which were determined in bulk 1.3 M sucrose solution at −4.0
°C, is also shown by the horizontal line for comparison.

Figure 6 Relative apparent
migration ratios (v300app/v100app) in
the FCS channels prepared with csucini = 0.68, 1.70, and 3.38 wt
%. Measurements were repeated on the ice platforms independently prepared;
four, two, and five platforms for csucini = 0.68, 1.70, and 3.38 wt
%, respectively. Error bars represent the standard deviation of measurements
on a given platform (the number of measurements is provided in Table S2). The purple broken line shows the migration
ratio obtained in free solution (1.3 M aqueous sucrose) at −4.0
°C.

The v300app/v100app ratios
obtained for ice channels prepared
from csucini = 1.70 and 3.38 wt % agreed with μ300free/μ100free. Our previous
work indicated that the surface of ice is negatively charged under
most aqueous conditions.29 This predicts
the electroosmotic flow from the anode to the cathode, that is, the
electroosmotic flow direction is opposite to that of the electrophoresis
of the particles. However, the agreement between v300app/v100app and μ300free/μ100free at csucini = 1.70 and 3.38 wt % indicates that the
electroosmotic flow in the present case is so small that the apparent
electrophoretic migration ratio can be considered equivalent to the
electrophoretic mobility ratio. Also, the agreement between the ratios
suggests that particle migration was not affected by the physical
interference from the ice channel under these conditions because the
FCS channel size is sufficiently large. In contrast, the v300app/v100app ratio for csucini = 0.68 wt % was significantly smaller than
μ300free/μ100free. This indicates that 0.3 μm particles undergo greater physical
interference from the ice wall than do 100 nm particles at csucini = 0.68 wt %. Although both 100 and 300 nm particles can pass through
the channel under this condition, the migration of the 300 nm particle
is hindered by the wall interaction to a larger extent. This makes
it easy to differentiate 100 and 300 nm particles, which have similar
intrinsic electrophoretic mobility.

Separation of Particles
with Different Sizes Using Ice Septum
The above studies suggest
that actual separation of particles is
feasible using an ice septum as a size-selective separator. Based
on the criteria shown in Table 1, the size separation of microparticles and nanoparticles
was studied. The particles, which were dyed with different fluorescence
pigments, were used as virtual samples. Figure 7A shows a microscopic image of microparticles
after the application of electrophoretic voltage. Initially, YO-dyed
0.5 μm and YG-dyed 3 μm particles were added in the source
phase, which was in contact with an ice septum prepared with csucini = 1.70 wt %. After the electrophoretic voltage was imposed, red-fluorescence
streams of YO-dyed 0.5 μm particles were seen in the receiver
phase, whereas YG-dyed 3 μm particles remained in the source
phase. The fluorescence intensity in the receiver phase near the ice
septum was measured at λ > 570 nm. Figure 7B shows the time change in the fluorescence
intensity near the FCS/ice interface in the receiver phase. The intensity
increased almost linearly with time and continued to increase 10 min
after the voltage application. Although the migration of the 3 μm
particles toward the ice septum was confirmed, they could not enter
the channels and were repelled from the septum in the source phase
because the channel size is smaller than 3 μm.

Figure 7 Separation of particles
of different sizes. (A) Microscopic views
of YO-dyed 0.5 μm and YG-dyed 3 μm particles 10 min after
the application of electrophoretic voltage at 40 V (csucini = 1.70
wt %). (B) Time change in fluorescence intensity at the outlet ice/FCS
interface for YO-dyed particles (λ > 570 nm). (C) Time change
in fluorescence intensities at the outlet ice/FCS interface for YO-dyed
500 and 100 nm YG particles.

Similarly, the separation of YO-dyed 500- and YG-dyed 100 nm particles
was studied using an ice septum prepared with csucini = 1.70 wt
%. The time changes in the fluorescence intensities for YO and YG
dyes are compared in Figure 7C. The intensity of YG increased with time >30 min, whereas
that for YO was almost constant. Thus, these particles were successfully
separated by the ice septum, in which the FCS channel dimension was
controlled by csucini.

Conclusions
In
this paper, we reported the fabrication of size-tunable micro/nano-channels
using frozen aqueous sucrose. The channel thickness, which determines
the size selectivity, can be controlled in the range of 50 nm to 3
μm. Although we did not attempt larger dimensions, it should
be possible using higher sucrose concentrations. In contrast, it was
not possible to fabricate channels with thickness smaller than 50
nm because the FCS formed discrete pools rather than through-channels.
This may arise because the volume of the FCS is too small. As stated
in the main text, the formation of a long channel is related to the
viscosity of the FCS because it causes interfacial fluctuation. Also,
the interfacial tension between the FCS and ice surface is an important
factor to determine channel dimensions because the FCS of high ice-wettability
can be penetrated between ice phases to allow the formation of thin
fluidic channels. Under the condition where a highly viscous FCS wets
the ice surface better than the sucrose FCS, thinner FCS channels
may possibly be formed in an ice septum. Also, it was indicated that
two different FCSs are formed in frozen aqueous sucrose by Bogdan
et al.;28 more concentrated FCS is present
in the channel structures, while the FCS with lower concentration
exists outside the ice framework. This suggests that the higher sucrose
concentration in the ice framework makes difficult the development
of the channel structure particularly at high csucini. This may
be overcome by varying freezing temperatures. Such conditions should
be sought to enhance the applicability of the present approach.

The FCS channel dimension was controlled by csucini. However,
the temperature control of the channel dimension should be more useful
because channel sizes can be varied simply by changing the working
temperature on the same ice platform. However, it is difficult to
realize this operation in the present system because csucFCS is a
function of temperature, and the sucrose concentration in the source
and receiver phases will vary with the temperature. Nevertheless,
temperature control should be possible by fabricating the ice septum
in a tunnel opened in bulk ice. In such a system, if the temperature
is changed, csucFCS in the solution phase is automatically adjusted
by melting of the tunnel wall or freezing of the FCS.

Hence,
there remain a number of tasks to be overcome to enhance
the usefulness of the present approach. However, in this study, we
have successfully demonstrated the potential of a frozen solution
for fabricating micro-/nanofluidic channel structures. The present
concept may inspire researchers to attempt various frozen solutions
for nano-fabrication. This highly versatile approach is expected to
bring about a breakthrough in nanoscience/technology.

Experimental
Section
The instrumental setup is schematically given in Figure 8. A homemade Cu cell
was placed
on a Peltier array, which was driven by a Peltier controller (Cell
System, Yokohama Japan). The cell had a solvent reservoir (16 mm diameter,
3 mm depth), which was filled with 1:1 water/ethylene glycol. A capillary
(450 μm i.d., 980 μm o.d.) was inserted through holes
drilled on the side walls of the cell and was immersed in water/ethylene
glycol. The depth of the capillary from the surface of water/ethylene
glycol was approximately 1 mm. An ice septum was fabricated in a capillary
kept at −14.0 °C. A small portion of aqueous sucrose (sucrose
concentration csucini) was placed at the center of the capillary
using a microsyringe. The thickness of the septum ranged from 300
to 500 μm depending on its preparation. After the septum was
annealed at −3.0 °C for 15 min, the temperature was decreased
to −4.0 °C, at which measurements were performed. Thus,
the inside of the capillary was separated into two compartments by
the ice septum. Both compartments were filled with unfrozen sucrose
solution, the composition of which was determined from the phase diagram
of the sucrose/water system (Figure S1);
the sucrose concentration at −4.0 °C was 38.1 wt % (=1.3
M). Fluorescent particles were added in one compartment, which acted
as the source phase; the other one acted as the receiver phase. Two
Ag/AgCl electrodes were inserted in both compartments. The interval
between the electrodes was kept at 5.0 mm. A voltage was applied to
the electrodes with a power supply (PAK60-12A, Kikusui). The current
was measured using a 2000 Multimeter (Keithley).

Figure 8 Experimental setup.

Particle behavior was observed using a fluorescence
microscope,
model BX61W1 (Olympus), with an Hg lamp as the light source. Two mirror
units were used: U-MGFPHQ (λex = 460–480 nm,
λem = 495–540 nm, dichroic mirror 485 nm)
and U-MRFPHQ (λex = 535–555 nm, λem = 570–625 nm, dichroic mirror 565 nm). Images were
acquired using a CCD camera, model EM-CCD (Hamamatsu Photonics), and
processed using the software MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). In some
experiments, a laser confocal microscope (FV1200, Olympus) was used
to observe particle behavior and channel developments.
