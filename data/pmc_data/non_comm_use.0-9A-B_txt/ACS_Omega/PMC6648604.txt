One-dimensional tungsten disulfide
(WS2) single-walled
nanotubes (NTs) with either achiral, i.e., armchair (n, n) and zigzag-type (n, 0), or
chiral (2n, n) configuration with
diameters dNT > 1.9 nm have been found
to be suitable for photocatalytic applications, since their band gaps
correspond to the frequency range of visible light between red and
violet (1.5 eV < Δεgap < 2.6 eV). We
have simulated the electronic structure of nanotubes with diameters
up to 12.0 nm. The calculated top of the valence band and the bottom
of the conduction band (εVB and εCB, respectively) have been properly aligned relatively to the oxidation
(εO2/H2O) and reduction (εH2/H2O) potentials of water. Very narrow
nanotubes (0.5 < dNT < 1.9 nm) are
unsuitable for water splitting because the condition εVB < εO2/H2O < εH2/H2O < εCB does
not hold. For nanotubes with dNT >
1.9
nm, the condition εVB < εO2/H2O < εH2/H2O < εCB is fulfilled. The values of εVB and εCB have been found to depend only
on the diameter and not on the chirality index of the nanotube. The
reported structural and electronic properties have been obtained from
either hybrid density functional theory and Hartree–Fock linear
combination of atomic orbitals calculations (using the HSE06 functional)
or the linear augmented cylindrical waves density functional theory
method. In addition to single-walled NTs, we have investigated a number
of achiral double-walled (m, m)@(n, n) and (m, 0)@(n, 0) as well as triple-walled (l, l)@(m, m)@(n, n) and (l, 0)@(m, 0)@(n, 0) nanotubes. All multiwalled nanotubes
show a common dependence of their band gap on the diameter of the
inner nanotube, independent of chirality index and number of walls.
This behavior of WS2 NTs allows the exploitation of the
entire range of the visible spectrum by suitably tuning the band gap.

I Introduction
Despite substantial progress
in science and technology of renewable
energy strategies in the last decades, many fundamental issues still
need to be addressed. One of the possibilities to substitute fossil
fuel consumption by an alternative based on renewable sources is to
develop efficient catalysts for solar hydrogen generation from water.
Such catalysts have been known already for about 40 years, beginning
with the pioneering work of Honda and Fujishima.1 However, such catalysts are not yet economically competitive
for hydrogen production, since competitiveness would require conversion
efficiencies higher than the currently achieved values of slightly
more than 10%.2

Anatase- and rutile-structured
TiO2 were used in the
pioneering work and have been extensively studied to date. TiO2 gained attention due to its range of favorable properties3 such as chemical stability, photocorrosion resistance,
water insolubility, nontoxicity, low cost, and natural abundance.
However, while the position of the conduction band bottom is quite
beneficial, the top of the valence band of titania is far from the
desired level, and the band gap is too wide (3.2 eV for bulk anatase
vs 3.0 eV for rutile bulk), requiring energies near the ultraviolet
edge of the solar spectrum and thus outside the range of visible light.
This wide band gap leads to the necessity to either manipulate the
properties of TiO2 and other binary and ternary transition-metal
oxides4 or study other prospective materials.
In the first case, since most band gaps were found to be too wide
(≥3.0 eV), doping the material with certain substitutional
atoms could result in the appearance of additionally induced levels
inside the band gap, thus creating new optical absorption edges and
reducing the energy threshold necessary for adsorption of visible-light
photons.5 On the other hand, alternative
nonoxide layered materials, in particular transition-metal chalcogenides,
gained growing attention in the last years, since they possess significantly
narrower band gaps than transition-metal oxides. One of them is tungsten
disulfide WS2. The band gap of bulk WS2 was
measured to be ∼1.4 eV,6 corresponding
to the near-infrared, invisible range of the light spectrum.

The hexagonal 2H c phase of bulk WS2 possesses a graphite-like
structure, consisting of layers formed by three atomic planes (S–W–S);
the WS2 layers interact only via weak interlayer van der
Waals forces.7 Although bulk WS2 was found to suffer from photocorrosion, which essentially destroys
its photocatalytic suitability,8 a noticeable
strengthening of its resistance to this undesirable process can be
achieved by the transition from three-dimensional (3D) material structures
to those of lower dimensionality, e.g., thin two-dimensional (2D)
nanofilms.9 The fundamental band gap for
the single-monolayer (1 ML) WS2(0001) nanosheet (when supported
by Si10 or α-Al2O3 substrates11) was experimentally
found to be 2.4 eV, significantly larger than that of bulk WS2 (1.4 eV). The band gap edges εVB and εCB of tungsten disulfide are properly aligned relatively to
the redox potentials εO2/H2O and εH2/H2O (Figure 1 in ref (9)). Simultaneously, both
the electron mobility and the specific amount of active sites on WS2(0001) nanosheets were found to be noticeably higher than
those on the (101) anatase facet.9 A number
of experimental and theoretical studies of pristine and defective
tungsten disulfide thin nanofilms have been performed so far, e.g.,
those described in refs (9−17). In particular, defects formed on a single WS2 monolayer
lead to the formation of induced states in the middle of the band
gap, thus opening up possibilities to form n- or p-type semiconductors
in the presence of S or W vacancies, respectively.16 However, the induced localized states would prohibit water
splitting in the proximity of defective WS2(0001), which
means that only pristine or almost defectless tungsten disulfide nanosheets
can be suitable for photocatalytic applications.

Figure 1 Three types of WS2 SWNTs with different chiralities
modeled in this study: (a) armchair (12, 12), (b) zigzag (21, 0),
and (c) chiral (16, 8). The left-hand side
of each subfigure corresponds to the NT cross section, while the right-hand
side depicts the side view of the NT unit cell.

Hence, only one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanotubes
(NTs)18−27 and nanoribbons28 or zero-dimensional
structures such as fullerene-like nanocages22 and nanoclusters29,30 of WS2 can possibly
be suitable for photocatalysis. WS2 nanotubes (NTs) were
first synthesized in 1992 by the group of Tenne,18 while their theoretical characterization is still in its
infancy.26,27 The latter studies took into account approaches
based on the line symmetry group formalism, using either valence force
fields combined with semiempirical density functional tight binding
(DFTB) theory26 or an ab initio hybrid
density functional theory (DFT) Hartree–Fock (HF) formalism
using the HSE06 functional in which the Hamiltonian of density functional
theory is extended by the Hartree–Fock exchange and correlation
functionals.27 Earlier ab initio calculations
of WS2-based nanotubes by Zibouche et al.21 compared the electronic structure of the bulk, layered,
and nanotubular forms for molybdenum and tungsten disulfides. In refs (21)(25)(26), and (27) the vibrational and electronic
properties of WS2 NTs were calculated and analyzed, but
not their possible photocatalytic applications. Among the numerous
experimental studies of these nanomaterials, this point was ignored
too, except for a few manuscripts directly devoted to evaluation of
the photocatalytic suitability of WS2 nanotubes. For example,
Zhu et al.20 undertook a successful attempt
to synthesize Nb-doped WS2 nanotubes, which inhibits the
formation of defective NTs unlike in the synthesis of pristine nanotubes.
Yadgarov et al.22 studied controlled doping
of tungsten disulfide nanotubes and fullerene-shaped structures. These
authors noticed in particular that the presence of Re dopants results
in a drop of the electrical resistivity, leading to more efficient
electron transport through the corresponding nanotubes. Tsverin et
al.23 concluded that the significant enhancement
in the photoactivity of hybrid nanostructures can be attributed to
the combination of metallic Co nanoparticles and semiconducting WS2 NTs. In the case of hybrid nanostructures, efficient light
absorption by nanotubes occurs and the subsequent charge separation
between the hybrid semiconductor WS2 NT and the metallic
nanocluster takes place under visible-light illumination.

This
short survey leads us to conclude that, although there are
numerous reports on the successful evaluation of WS2-based
catalysts for solar hydrogen generation, comprehensive investigations
of sophisticated monoperiodic structures like nanotubes are rather
scarce; specifically, theoretical insight into the origin of their
performance is missing. We aim to fill this gap by simulating a series
of WS2 NTs, with different nanotube chiralities and diameters dNT up to 12 nm. This paper is structured as
follows: in Section II, the models of single-walled (SWNT), double-walled (DWNT), and triple-walled
(TWNT) WS2 NTs as well as their relevant parameters (Section II.I) are described;
computational details of the ab initio calculations are given for
both the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method implemented
within the hybrid DFT and HF approach (Section II.II) and the linear combination of cylindrical
waves method (LACW) (Section II.III). Sections III.I and III.II compare the energetics
of pristine WS2 NTs of different sizes and chiralities
for single- and multiwalled (MW) nanotubes, respectively, highlighting
the corresponding conditions and limitations. In Section III.III, we compare the electronic
structure of some single-walled nanotubes with different chiralities
obtained by two different methods, namely, the DFT-LCAO method and
the DFT-LACW method. Section IV provides a short summary of the results obtained.

II Computational Details
II.I Models of WS2 Nanotubes
Symmetry and structure of WS2 NTs
can be described by
folding the corresponding nanolayer, i.e., construction of the cylindrical
nanotubes by rolling up graphene-like 2D nanosheets with hexagonal
structure using the formalism of line groups.26,27 For this purpose, the nomenclature of single-walled (m, n) carbon nanotubes can be expressed via the so-called
chirality indices m and n as described
earlier.31 Within this formalism, the nanotube
diameter dNT is determined as the diameter
of the WS2 cylinder defined by the centers of the tungsten
atoms 1  where L is the circumferential
length of the WS2 SWNTs, while a = 0.315
nm7 is the lattice constant of the WS2 monolayer. To study the properties of SWNTs as a function
of diameter and chirality index, in either the achiral (possessing
armchair (n, n) and zigzag-type
(n, 0) morphologies) or the chiral (2n, n) configuration, we have performed large-scale
ab initio calculations of their electronic structure, in which we
vary the diameter dNT from about 1.0–12.0
nm by varying n (Figure 1).

For multiwalled (MW) NTs, only achiral
configurations were modeled due to the high computational cost for
the chiral (2n, n) NTs with their
extended unit cell along the nanotube axis. Cross sections of the
achiral double-walled (m, m)@(n, n) and (m, 0)@(n, 0) nanotubes (DWNTs) as well as triple-walled (l, l)@(m, m)@(n, n) and (l, 0)@(m, 0)@(n, 0) nanotubes (TWNTs)
are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

30)@(20, 20) (right) WS2 TWNTs.

II.II Hybrid DFT and HF-LCAO Method
In
the present study, we have performed hybrid density functional theory
(DFT) calculations using the CRYSTAL14 computer code,32 which utilizes localized Gaussian-type functions in the
form of atom-centered basis sets (BSs) for expansion of periodic crystalline
orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). In our
earlier paper,33 we used the PBE0 hybrid
functional for fully relaxed calculations of bulk WS2 and
could not adequately reproduce the experimental value of the band
gap for the hexagonal morphology (2.51 eV (calculated) vs 1.3–1.4
eV (experimental)). On the other hand, the HSE06 hybrid functional34,35 used in the current study proved to be much more adequate for reproducing
the experimental value with the computed one of 1.58 eV. The ECP-1111s-1111p-11d36 basis set (BS) was adopted for sulfur atoms,
while for tungsten atoms, the ECP-11sp-31d56 BS was employed,37 using an effective core pseudopotential (ECP)
to accelerate the computation. To provide a balanced summation in
both direct and reciprocal lattices, the reciprocal space integration
was performed by sampling the Brillouin zone (BZ) with the 18 ×
1 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh,38 which results in a total of 10 k-points evenly
distributed over the BZ. Calculations were considered as converged
only when the total energy differs by less than 10–9 au in two successive cycles of the self-consistent field procedure.32

To take into account weak interactions
between adjacent walls of the MW WS2 NTs, one can apply
the Grimme dispersion correction (DC).39 However, no noticeable influence of the DC was found on the positions
of energy levels in recent ab initio simulations of multilayered WS2(0001) nanothin films.40 On the
other hand, real contribution to the interwall interactions in transition-metal
disulfide nanostructures can be caused by weak repulsion between the
negatively charged external S-shells.41 Their quantitative estimate can be performed by calculating the
difference between the energy of a multilayer system and the sum of
energies of its constituents. Such an analysis has been performed
here for MW WS2 NTs: to this end, we have calculated the
interwall interaction energies for DWNTs and TWNTs 2a   2b  where E{(n1, n1′)@(n2, n2′)} – E{(n1, n1′)} – E{(n2, n2′)} and E{(n1, n1′)@(n2, n2′)@(n3, n3′)} – E{(n1, n1′)} – E{(n2, n2′)} – E{(n3, n3′)} stand
for DW and TW nanotubes and their constituents, respectively, while Z(D(T)WNT) is the number of formula units per unit cell
of the corresponding DW or TW nanotubes. Results of these quantitative
estimates are presented and analyzed in Section III.I.

II.III DFT-LACW Method
The linearized
augmented cylindrical wave (LACW) technique is an extension of the
linearized augmented plane-wave (LAPW) method to the specific case
of one-dimensional cylindrical or tubular polyatomic systems such
as the WS2 nanotubes studied here (Figure 1). The main foundations and applications
of the LACW method have been described in detail elsewhere42−46 and are compiled in a recent review.47 Similar to the simple version of the original LAPW theory for bulk
materials, the LACW method is based on the muffin-tin (MT) and the
local density exchange approximation for the electronic potential.
That is, the potential V(r) is constructed
to be spherically symmetric Vα(r) in the regions of atomic cores (within the MT spheres
α) and constant with a value V0 in
the region between the atomic cores. However, a large difference exists
between the bulk phase and nanomaterials because in the former case,
the electron redistribution is unlimited in all spatial directions,
while it is strongly confined to a thin tubular layer in NTs in the
latter case. Therefore, the MT method has to be somewhat adapted to
the case of tubular structures. Specifically, in the LACW method,
the tubule is considered to be positioned between two impenetrable
barriers Ωa and Ωb of cylindrical
symmetry, separating the polyatomic system from the vacuum regions
outside and inside the NT. The width d of the cylindrical
layer between Ωa and Ωb becomes
a parameter of the model. As a result, the electronic structure of
the NTs is determined by free electron movement in the interspherical
region, electron scattering by the MT spheres, and electron reflection
from the cylindrical barriers Ωa and Ωb. Similar to the LAPW model, we also apply Slater’s
ρ(r)1/3 potential for the exchange–correlation
term, where the electron density ρ of the nanotube is calculated
as a superposition of atomic electron densities ρα(r).

Originally, the DFT-LACW code can only
perform calculations for the perfect WS2 SWNT structures
only by rolling up a WS2 sheet without further geometry
optimization of the tubules. Thereby, a symmetrized version of the
LACW technique can be applied, where the unit cell of any nanotube
is reduced to one formula unit, and the band structure takes a simple
form. The thickness of the cylindrical layers and the reference energy
have been chosen so as to reproduce the DFT-LCAO width of the band
gap (1.86 eV) and the valence band top (−6.28 eV) of the (12,
12) WS2 nanotube. Moreover, to improve agreement with the
DFT-LCAO results, we have performed LACW calculations on CRYSTAL-optimized
structures of WS2 SWNTs. Some quantitative differences
between the corresponding densities of states (DOSs) for the initial
(Figure 1) and CRYSTAL-optimized
configurations of nanotubes are visible (see below). For example,
the ratios of intensities between DOSs peaks are different; however,
all three pairs of densities of states are qualitatively similar before
and after structural optimization.

III Results
and Discussion
III.I Calculated Properties
of Pristine Single-Walled
Nanotubes
Several special conditions need to be fulfilled
for a material to be photocatalytically active for water splitting.
First of all, the band gap εgap of the catalyst must
be in the visible-light range between 1.5 and 2.7 eV; for the solar
intensity distribution, the maximum efficiency can be achieved for
a band gap between 2.0 and 2.2 eV. The energy conservation condition
requires that both the oxidation and reduction potentials of the H2O molecule in solution defined thermodynamically (εO2/H2O = −5.67 eV and εH2/H2O = −4.44 eV)4,5 must be positioned inside the band gap of the photocatalytic electrode.
Thus, the following inequalities must hold 3  where εVB and εCB are the energies of the top of
the valence band and the
bottom of the conduction band, respectively. To justify the alignment
of the calculated band gap edges of transition-metal oxide nanostructures
relatively to thermodynamically defined redox potential levels, we
calculated earlier the one-electron energies for the corresponding
stoichiometric multilayers.48 Unlike 3D
bulk, DFT-LCAO calculations on 2D and 1D periodic systems give qualitatively
correct distributions of the discrete energies relative to the zero
vacuum level.5

Table 1 and Figure 4 present results of the LCAO calculations of the band
edge parameters of approximately 40 different WS2 nanotubes,
including the position of the top of the valence band and the bottom
of the conduction band relative to the reduction and oxidation potentials
of water, εH2/H2O and εO2/H2O, respectively. One can see that
the top of the valence band of NTs with dNT ≥ 1.9 nm is positioned below the εO2/H2O level; thus, the first part of eq 3 is satisfied for all SWNTs.

as chiral (2n, n). Energy is referenced
to a vacuum level.

repeated NT unit cell, Nat; the optimized
nanotube diameter, dNT; the strain energy
of the corresponding 2D periodic monolayer, Estrain, defined as the difference per formula unit between
the corresponding energies of single ML and SWNT; the band gap, Δεgap, the positions of the bottom of the conduction band relative
to the H2/H2O reduction potential or standard
hydrogen electrode (SHE); εCB (positive sign means
that the band gap edge is lying above the SHE level); and the positions
of the top of the valence band with respect to the O2/H2O oxidation potential; εVB (negative sign
means that the band edge is below the εO2/H2O level). Data are given for achiral armchair (n, n) and zigzag (n, 0)
as well as for chiral (2n, n) WS2 SWNTs.

For small
SWNTs (dNT < 1.9 nm),
the bottom of the conduction band is located below the εH2/H2O level, which prevents the catalytic
decomposition of H2O. However, an increase in the diameter
leads to a rapid shift of the εCB level upward, and
thus eq 3 is valid for
all nanotubes of diameter dNT ≥
1.9 nm, irrespective of chirality. The width of the optical band gap
Δεgap ranges from 0.87 to 2.52 eV, and it increases
rapidly with increasing diameter and satisfies eq 3 for all diameters dNT ≥ 1.9 nm. Optimum values of the band gap, Δεgap (in the range of 2.0–2.2 eV) correspond to nanotubes
with diameters between 2 and 3 nm.

Figure 4 displays
the band gap edges graphically for the WS2 SWNTs with the
three considered configurations (see Figure 1). A straightforward observation is that
the band gap edges depend only on NT diameter and are identical for
NTs with the same diameter, independent of morphology. It is obvious
that for very narrow NTs with dNT <
1.0 nm, the gap width is smaller than the critical value of 1.23 eV,
with both the VB top and CB bottom located between the redox levels.

The band gap widens and the edges move in opposite directions,
approaching a limiting value with an approximately exponential dependence
on NT diameter. At dNT ∼ 3 nm,
the value of Δεgap reaches 2.0 eV, which, as
was mentioned earlier, corresponds to an approximately optimal average
value for a water-splitting photocatalyst under sunlight irradiation.
It should also be noted that the CB bottom is closer to the critical
H2/H2O reduction potential or standard hydrogen
electrode (SHE) level than the VB top is to the oxidation potential
εO2/H2O. Upon further increase
beyond 3 nm, the band gap growth is less steep, converging to ∼2.5
eV, which is regarded as the upper bound of an optimal band gap. The
CB bottom is still closer to its neighboring reduction level than
the VB top is to the value of εO2/H2O.

III.II Calculated Properties of Multiwalled Pristine
Nanotubes
For MWNTs, only their achiral configurations have
been modeled (Figures 2 and 3), due to the high computation costs
for the chiral (2n, n) NTs, whose
unit cells contain a large numbers of atoms (Figure 1c). Several configurations were considered
for DWNTs. The largest diameter of the outer NT was 7.07 nm for the
(n, 0) configuration and 10.4 nm for (n, n) NTs (Figure 5). The choice of wall pairs was driven by the desire
to keep the optimized interwall distances as close to the experimental
value of 6.3–6.5 Å as possible,49 while keeping the number of atoms in the elementary cell small.
This objective is not perfectly fulfilled, since the rototranslational
symmetry exploited in the CRYSTAL computational code32 requires that the two (or three) NT shells are commensurate.
We thus chose MWNTs with differences between the chirality indices
to be multiples of 10, e.g., (40, 40)@(30, 30), to reduce computational

Five different DW configurations have been modeled (Table 2). A consistent observation
is that the band gap of DWNT is always slightly narrower than the
gaps of each of the individual constituent SWNTs. The difference values
in the range of tens of meV are characteristic for van der Waals interactions
between the two layers. This effect is even more prominent for the
TWNTs, when we compare the positions of the CB bottom for the TWNT
and the (20, 0) model. Unfortunately, for TWNTs, the shift of the
CB edge becomes detrimental for photocatalysis. For DWNTs, the effect
is ambivalent: for the smaller NTs, the CB edge shift is excessive,
while for the larger NTs, it becomes favorable. All results calculated
for DW and TWNTs are systematized in Figure 5.

sign denotes interwall attraction or repulsion, respectively); band
gap, Δεgap; positions of the bottom of the
conduction band relative to the standard hydrogen electrode SHE potential,
εCB (negative sign means that the band edge is lying
below the εH2/H2O level), and
positions of the top of the valence band with respect to the O2/H2O oxidation potential, εVB (negative
sign means that the band edge is lying below the εO2/H2O level).

In the case of TWNTs, only one specific variation
has been considered
for each achiral configuration (Figure 3), to construct a triple-wall nanotube from the previously
modeled SWNTs with the condition of keeping the interwall distance
realistic and using only multiples of 10 for the chirality indices
so as to facilitate symmetry exploitation at a reasonable computational
cost. The calculated properties of the two TWNTs are combined in Table 2 to those of DWNTs.
The aforementioned conclusions for the (n, 0) NTs
are also applicable in the case of the (n, n) NTs: the presence of the van der Waals-induced band gap
reduction effect for MWNTs is visible; it is, however, less prominent
for the (n, n) TWNTs compared to
their (n, 0) analogues. In any case, for the larger
DWNTs, the suitability for photocatalytical water splitting is higher
than for their SW constituents.

Table 2 also shows
that the interwall interactions Eint estimated
using eqs 2a and 2b are predominantly attractive in WS2 MWNTs
with armchair configuration, while they are mainly repulsive for zigzag-type
NTs. In any case, the absolute values of Eint increase with decreasing interwall distances. However, these interactions
are found to be very weak (about 50–500 times smaller) in comparison
to those in DW V2O5 nanotubes.50 These differences may be due to strong Coulomb interactions,
which dominate the interactions between the inner and outer walls
of transition-metal-oxide DWNTs, whereas the interaction in metal
sulfide DWNTs is the result of van der Waals and weak electrostatic
interactions.

III.III Comparison of DOSs
for WS2 SWNTs
Calculated Using DFT-LCAO and DFT-LACW Methods
Figure 6 compares the total and projected
densities of states (DOS) calculated using the DFT-LCAO (left) and
DFT-LACW (right) methods for [0001]-oriented WS2 NTs with
chirality indexes (12, 12), (16, 8), and (21, 0) (Figure 1), which all have a diameter
of ∼2.2 nm (Table 1). The LCAO and LACW calculations on WS2 SWNTs
allow us to perform an orbital analysis of the projected DOS to clarify
their natural chemical composition. Independent of chirality, in all
studied pristine WS2 NTs, the upper part of the VB is predominantly
formed by the S (3p) orbitals with significant contributions from
W (5d) orbitals, except for the outermost range of the VB, where LCAO
calculations provide noticeably larger contributions from W (5d) orbitals.
LACW calculations also produce qualitatively similar results for the
armchair (12, 12) WS2 SWNT. This is in line with results
of our recent calculations performed using the LCAO approach for both
single- and multilayered WS2(0001) nanofilms,40 where each valence band can be divided into
two parts: the wide bottom one, with dominant contributions from S
(3p) orbitals, and the outermost states have a larger contribution
from W (5d) orbitals. In contrast, results obtained when using both
LCAO and LACW calculations clearly show that the bottom-most parts
of the conduction band are formed mainly by W (5d) states with a partial
contribution from S (3p) states.

Figure 6 Total and projected electronic densities
of states (DOSs) calculated
for the (12, 12), (16, 8), and (21, 0) SWNTs using the DFT-LCAO (a,
c, e) and DFT-LACW (b, d, e) methods, respectively. The effect of
crossing between the vertical SHE line and the bottom of the conduction
band in all of the plots (a–f) is caused by Gaussian semiextension
of each DOS peak. In reality, a small gap between them exists as follows
from Figure 4.

For either calculation method
(LCAO and LACW), the top of the valence
band is positioned well below the oxidation potential O2/H2O, irrespective of the NT chirality and independent
of the diameter of the nanotubes (Figure 4). Interestingly, the bottom of the conduction
band for the (12, 12), (21, 0), and (16, 8) WS2 NTs with
diameter of 2.2 nm is positioned almost exactly at the reduction potential,
εH2/H2O. Hence, hydrogen evolution
is possible for water splitting with the WS2 NT photocatalyst,
when the nanotube diameter is larger than ∼1.9 nm, as mentioned
above. On the whole, both methods of computation are qualitatively
compatible for the description of the DOSs. Figures 4 and 6 thus confirm
the potential suitability of pristine single-walled WS2 nanotubes for photocatalytic applications.

IV Summary and Conclusions
We have simulated the electronic
structure of pristine single-walled
WS2 NTs of three different types of chirality (Figure 1) as a function of
nanotube diameter. The band edges depend in all of the cases only
on the diameter dNT (and not on the chirality
indices of the nanotubes). For dNT >
1.9
nm, the energy diagrams for WS2 SWNTs (Figure 4) support the potential ability
of the NTs to serve as photocatalysts for water-splitting reactions.
In this diameter range, the necessary condition for the ordering of
energies, εVB < εO2/H2O < εH2/H2O < εCB,5 is fulfilled.
Thus, by choosing the NT diameter appropriately, the band gap can
be tuned with high-energy resolution, which makes WS2 SWNTs
suitable for photocatalytic applications in the visible spectrum.

In addition, we have computed the electronic structure of several
selected double- and triple-walled WS2 nanotubes with armchair-
(n, n) and zigzag-type (n, 0) configurations (Figures 2 and 3), which have
not been simulated so far. It has been found that the value of Δεgap is smaller than the corresponding values for each of its
constituents (cf. Figures 4 and 5) caused by the influence of
interwall interactions. This further increases the variability of
possible energy ranges suitable for photocatalysis.

Hence, in
summary, for pristine WS2 nanotubes with diameters
in the range of 2–12 nm, the energies of the optical gaps,
the positions of the top of the valence band and the bottom of the
conduction band relative to the oxidation and reduction potentials
of the H2O medium are suitable for the photochemical splitting
of water and hydrogen production under solar irradiation. In the next
stage of our study, we plan to perform molecular dynamics simulations
of the interactions of water films with the WS2 nanosubstrate,
analogous to our recent work for the H2O/TiO2 system.51
