Rapid,
accurate, and real-time measurements of ocean salinity are
of great importance for a host of scientific, commercial, and defense
applications. We demonstrate a highly sensitive, fast-responding fiber-optic
salinity sensor that integrates long-period fiber gratings (LPFGs)
with ionic strength-responsive hydrogel. The submicron-thick hydrogel
was synthesized via layer-by-layer electrostatic assembly of partially
quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine) (qP4VP) and poly(acrylic acid),
followed by chemical cross-linking. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement
of a hydrogel made of 37% quaternized qP4VP showed robust and reversible
swelling/deswelling in solutions with salt concentrations ranging
from 0.4 to 0.8 M (22.8–44.7 g/kg) around pH 8.1. The swelling/deswelling
process induced large changes in the refractive index of the hydrogel,
leading to resultant shift in the resonance wavelength (RW) of LPFGs.
The salinity-dependent optical response of the hydrogel-coated LPFGs
is in good agreement with ellipsometry measurement. LPFGs coated with
the hydrogel exhibited a sensitivity of 7 nm RW shift/M (125.5 pm/‰)
with a measurement time less than 5 s. The shift in the resonance
wavelength correlated linearly with salt concentration, making quantification
of measured salinity straightforward.

Introduction
Ocean salinity has gained heightened attention
in the study of
marine biology and global ocean currents. The long-term surface salinity
of ocean is also one prime parameter in monitoring global climate
change as well as fresh water circulation.1 The marine organisms and submarine activities are mainly affected
by the salinity in the marine environment.2 The mass of marine salinity is around 35 g/kg, and the concentration
of salinity is typically measured by the conductivity temperature
depth system based on the relationship between the amount of chloride
ions and the electrical conductivity in the ocean.3 One major drawback is that this method is vulnerable to
electric interference. Even though the Global Remote Sensing System
can obtain the large area, real-time, and surface salinity data of
the global ocean, the capability of this system has disadvantages
such as limited sensing depth, unacceptable, costs and the specific
design of hardware/software.4 Recently,
researchers have shed light on the optical fiber-based sensors for
salinity owing to the desirable advantages such as low cost, compact
size, pollution free, remote sensing, corrosion resistance, antielectromagnetic
interference, and so on. Basically, the refractive index (RI) of seawater
will vary in the marine salinity, which means that the accurate salinity
can be measured indirectly by the refractive index.5 The various optical fiber sensors for salinity based on
the refractive index have been proposed and demonstrated, including
fiber gratings,6−8 fiber interferometers,9,10 fiber surface
plasma resonance (SPR),11,12 optical refraction13,14 and photonic crystal fiber (PCF),15 etc.
It should be noted that the salinity sensors based on interference
are fabricated by fiber tapering and/or splicing procedures, which
implies that the fiber structures are more fragile, easily damaged,
and need armored in the harsh underwater environment. For the SPR-based
sensors, a thin metallized film of nanometers in thickness is required
to deposit on the surface of the optical fiber. The sensors for salinity
are not allowed to work under seawater for long hours, due to strongly
corrosion of the seawater. Optical refraction-based sensors possess
a complex prism system and the overall size of the probe is relatively
heavy and large, which is difficult to apply in the ships or laboratories.
In addition, the refractometers integrated with PCF have the challenge
in loading aqueous samples into the tiny air holes of the cross-sectional
PCF, which leads to a longer response time.

Long-period fiber
gratings (LPFGs)-based sensors have been in use
for salinity based on surrounding medium refractive index for years.8,16−19 The long-period fiber gratings have a period of gratings typically
in the range 100 μm to 1 mm that promotes coupling between the
propagating core mode and co-propagating cladding modes. The high
attenuation of the cladding modes results in a series of attenuation
bands centered at discrete wavelengths in the transmission spectrum,
with each attenuation band corresponding to a specific cladding mode.
The phase matching condition between the guided mode and the forward
propagating cladding modes is given by , where Λ is the grating
period, β01 and βcl(n) are the propagation
constants for the
fundamental core mode and the nth cladding mode,
respectively. The effective refractive indexes of the core and cladding
are obtained by  and , so the
expression of the resonance wavelength
(RW) is λres = (neff,co – neff,clad(n))Λ.20 The dependence of λres on neff,co and neff,clad(n) makes LPFGs a highly
sensitive index transduction platform. The higher sensitivity of LPFGs
is generally obtained by the special design in the fiber structures21−24 such as tapered, etched or D-shaped fibers, etc., that causes the
fragile mechanical property and complicated fabrication for LPFGs.
Scientific interest in LPFGs integrated with stimuli-responsive nanothin
film have emerged in recent years for multifunctionality and enhanced
sensitivity by surface refractive index increment.25−28 As a frontier in the functional
nanothin film, layer-by-layer (LbL) technique provides a highly controllable
means to build uniform thin films of unlimited functionalities with
conformity to any shape of the substrate.29,30 Refractive indices of polyelectrolyte LbL coatings with tunable
physicochemical properties have been reported to be strongly affected
by concentration of ionic strength.31,32 For example,
ionic strength-responsive chitosan (CHI)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)
polyelectrolyte multilayers on LPFGs for salinity sensing were recently
explored. Even though a dramatic improvement of sensitivity showed
a great promise, two opposite relations with a turning around point
between resonance wavelength shift and concentration of salinity were
discovered,8 due to two-component polyelectrolytes
in multilayers.33 Meanwhile, weakly charged
groups of CHI and PAA led to pH cross-sensitivity in the salinity
measurement. One of the most effective approaches to address the challenges
associated with pH cross-sensitivity and nonlinear correlation between
RWs and salinity is to develop single-component surface-bound hydrogels
by postassembly chemical cross-linking and release one of the two
types of polyelectrolytes based on LbL strategy.34,35 A novel ionic strength-responsive quaternary polymer with cross-linkable
groups was first synthesized and then assembled at the surface of
LPFGs within quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine) (qP4VP)/PAA LbL films
via LbL.

Quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine) (qP4VP) is characterized
by one
of highly cationic polyelectrolytes with strong permanent charge of
quaternary ammonium groups,36 and also
it is not responsive to temperature.37 In
the process of qP4VP synthesis, amino groups were introduced to the
side chain that confers chemically cross-linking ability to qP4VP,
to build up single-component hydrogel coatings. As a stimuli-responsive
coating, the nanoscale thickness and single chemistry component of
qP4VP hydrogel induce the significant and fast volume response to
the ionic strength in the aqueous solution, and the cross-linking
networks impart hydrogel stability and reversibility. Here, we show
that quaternary ionic strength-responsive hydrogel can be integrated
with LPFGs to improve the saline sensitivity by apparent swelling
or shrinking volume response and measure the surface refractive index
to detect salinity in the seawater. As we know, NaCl is the main component
of inorganic salts (several orders of magnitude larger than other
salts) in seawater.38 Thus, the cross-sensitivity
of other salts to NaCl is only about 15%. Most importantly, such errors
can always be compensated mathematically,39 so we use NaCl solution as the experimental sample instead of the
real seawater.

In this paper, a novel salinity sensor employing
long-period fiber
gratings (LPFGs) coated with nanoscale overlays of partially quaternized
poly(4-vinylpyridine) (qP4VP) hydrogel is proposed, to achieve high
sensitivity, specificity, and fast responsiveness in salinity sensing.
This was followed by chemical cross-linking of the coating to retain
qP4VP. PAA was released from the film to yield a qP4VP hydrogel, eliminating
pH cross-sensitivity. Furthermore, the swelling/deswelling mechanism
of salinity response of [q37P4VP]n hydrogel on LPFGs is proposed to understand the salinity response
based on the salt-induced changes in refractive index and thickness
of hydrogel coating by spectroscopic ellipsometry. The paper provides
significant insights into the mechanism of salinity response and the
synergistic effect between a 150-layer qP4VP hydrogel coating and
LPFGs, which endue our robust sensor with particular properties such
as high-salinity sensitivity, linear response, reversibility, and
repeatability.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the use of 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
to determine the degree of quanternization of qP4VP. After 300 min
of reaction (see Experimental Section), the
overall quaternization degree of qiP4VP
of 37 ± 1% was as calculated from the ratio of intensities of
f and d protons in Figure 1a. This value included 5% of units containing cross-linkable
amino groups and another 32% of units containing unreactive ethyl
moiety. Meanwhile, the same value of quaternization degree was also
calculated from FTIR data in Figure 1b using the intensity ratio of two bands at 1642 and
1601 cm–1, which correspond to skeletal vibrations
in quaternized and unquanternized pyridine rings, respectively, taking
into account the ratio of extinction coefficients of these bands of
1.68.32

To enable a quantitative study
of the film growth, the same deposition
procedure was used to assemble LbL films at the surface of precleaned
silicon wafer. An increase in dry thickness of q37P4VP/PAA
LbL film as a function of bilayer number measured via spectroscopic
ellipsometry is shown in Figure 2a. The thicknesses of polymer films were 72.2 and 46.2
nm for [q37P4VP/PAA]10 LbL film and [q37P4VP]10 hydrogel, respectively. The FTIR spectra of a
[q37P4VP/PAA]150 multilayers (top) and a [q37P4VP]150 hydrogel after releasing PAA (bottom)
on silicon wafer are shown in Figure 2b. The characteristic bands at 1642 and 1601 cm–1 corresponding to pyridinium and pyridine functional
groups32 are indicative of partial quanternization
of the polycation. The spectrum of [q37P4VP/PAA]150 multilayers has two additional bands: one at 1715 cm–1 associated with C=O stretching of protonated carboxylic groups
and another at 1570 cm–1 associated with antisymmetric
vibrations of −COO– groups of PAA.40 These two bands completely disappeared in the
spectra after the release of PAA, confirming successful synthesis
of single-component [q37P4VP]150 hydrogel coating.35 The same procedure was employed to deposit [q37P4VP]150 on the surface of LPFGs. As shown in Figure 3, the resultant [q37P4VP]150 hydrogel had a uniform dry thickness
of ∼910 nm, as observed in the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of the cross-section of the coated fiber.

LPFGs integrated with
[q37P4VP]150 were tested
at room temperature of 25 °C by immersing it in sodium chloride
aqueous solutions with the concentration from 0.4 to 0.8 M at an interval
of 0.1 M and pH 8.1 that simulates the marine environment. Figure 4 shows the RW of
LPFGs in response to different salinities. The salinity response of
pristine LPFGs without coating was also performed to compare and contrast
the sensitivity of the LPFGs with and without the hydrogel thin film.
A linear fitting to the experimental data showed a high coefficient
of correlation (0.99226 for [q37P4VP]150-coated
LPFGs and 1 for pristine LPFGs, averaged for all five measured RWs).
A sensitivity of 2 nm/M in RW shift for the pristine LPFGs (Figure 4, circles) was deduced
from the slope of the linear fitting curve. This linear correlation
is most likely due to the linear dependency of 0.0099 RIU/M for the
RI of the sodium chloride solution on concentration at room temperature.41 On the other hand, the [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs (Figure 4, squares) showed a sensitivity of 7.08 nm shift/M,
which is 3 times higher than that of the pristine LPFGs. The corresponding
transmission spectra of the [q37P4VP]150-coated
LPFGs for salinity response are shown in the inset of Figure 4.

Figure 4 RW shift of [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs (blue
square) and pristine LPFGs (black circle) for salinity response in
different concentrations. Solid lines stand for the linear fitting
to the experiment data. The inset shows the corresponding transmission
spectra of [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs in buffer
solution (0.01 M) and varied sodium chloride solutions.

Figure 5a shows
the real-time RW shift of the coated LPFGs as a function of time upon
immersion in sodium chloride solutions with concentrations from 0.8
to 0.4 M. A consistent and reproducible response for four cycles of
alternate salinity was achieved within a 0.01 nm variation at any
given concentration. The ionic strength-responsive hydrogel combined
with LPFGs showed good reproducibility and stability as a robust salinity
sensor, where chemical cross-linkage in the hydrogel on LPFGs plays
a paramount role.42 It is important to
establish the quantitative correlation between the RWs and salt concentrations
in Figure 4, where
the real-time measurement of salinity in the seawater is desirable.
Given the sweeping speed of the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) was
limited, it is worth to note that the measurement time of the [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs to salinity was less than
5 s, it is faster than those of the polyacrylamide and polyimide hydrogel
on Bragg gratings designed salinity sensors, whose whole measurements
need to wait 30 min.39 Over the past 250
years, there has been ongoing reduction in ocean pH, and pH value
of ocean is not usually constant43 due
to the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and environmental pollution,
etc. It is thus important to develop a pH-insensitive hydrogel to
eliminate the pH cross-sensitivity for an ocean salinity sensor. Figure 5b demonstrates that
all of the resonance wavelengths of the [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs for pH response are 1564.35 nm in pH value of 7, 7.5,
8, and 8.5 with the standard deviation of 0.05 nm, the pH effect in
this range can be ignored on the salinity response. Therefore, the
sensor prototype of [q37P4VP]150 integrated
with LPFGs has overcome the cross-sensitivity between salinity and
pH in harsh and intricate marine environment, resulting from the use
of strongly cationic quaternary ammonium groups and the absence of
dual-sensitive groups to ionic strength and pH such as carboxylic
acid and amino groups in the hydrogel.44

The inset shows the corresponding transmission spectra.

To understand the interaction between ionic strength
and hydrogel,
the refractive index and thickness of [q37P4VP]30 hydrogel deposited on silicon wafer were measured in sodium chloride
solution with different concentrations from 0.4 to 0.8 M using spectroscopic
ellipsometry. The [q37P4VP]30 coating has the
refractive index increment (dn/dc) up to 0.04 RIU/M in Figure 6a, which is more than 4 times higher than the 0.0099 RIU/M
of the RI dependence on salt water concentration itself. An increase
in ionic strength leads to increased water uptake and swelling in
the hydrogel, thus its density and the refractive index correspondingly
decrease as shown in Figure 6a. The mechanism of salinity responsiveness of [q37P4VP]n hydrogel is proposed and shown
in Figure 6b. The quaternary
ammonium groups of the [q37P4VP]n hydrogel carry permanent positive charge in aqueous solution.45 The corresponding electrostatic repulsion between
charged groups and additional osmotic pressure arising from counterions
within induce hydrogel swelling (i.e., a decrease in RI), resulting
in a blue shift in RW of LPFGs.8 A common
line of arguments to explain this type of dependences is that as concentration
of salt increases, positively charged groups of [q37P4VP]n hydrogel attract surrounding Cl– ions, resulting in the decrease of electrostatic repulsion due the
electrostatic screening effect of Cl– ions.46 The subsequent volume shrinking of [q37P4VP]n hydrogel takes place in the solutions
with higher salinity, leading to an increase of effective RI and thus
a red shift in RW of the LPFGs. This standard explanation might not
be completely applicable in this case because of the very low values
of the Debye screening length in high-salinity solutions studies in
this work (∼5 and 3.5 Å for 0.4 and 0.8 M NaCl solutions,
respectively). It is likely that another well-known phenomenon, i.e.,
a decrease in solubility of polyelectrolyte chains in salt solution,
known as a salting-out effect played a significant role in hydrogel
shrinking in the high-salt solution.47,48 Importantly,
variations in solution salinity caused almost linear changes in the
RI of the coatings and therefore provided a broad dynamic range for
RW-based salinity detection in the range of solution salinity similar
to that in seawater. Moreover, the effect was robust, i.e., fully
reversible and highly repeatable as demonstrated by the consistent
salinity response in cyclic measurements using the [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs.

Conclusions
In this work, we presented a sensitive and fast
salinity sensor
based on [qP4VP]150 hydrogel-coated LPFGs. The response
of the coated LPFGs in terms of RW shift shows a linear correlation
(R2 = 0.999) with salt concentrations
from 0.4 to 0.8 M (22.8–44.7 g/kg), making quantification of
measured salinity straightforward. Additionally, the hydrogel-coated
LPFGs show good performance in reproducibility and stability in various
salt solutions with a fast measurement time (less than 5 s) in cyclic
tests, due to the open, chemically cross-linked molecular network
and a relatively low, micron-scale thickness of the hydrogel coating.
Specifically, it was found that the [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs have no response to varying pH around 8.1 typical of
marine environment. The salinity sensitivity of the [q37P4VP]150-coated LPFGs was 7 nm/M (125.5 pm/‰),
3 times higher than that of the pristine LPFGs. The robust ionic strength
responsiveness of [q37P4VP]150 hydrogel markedly
amplified the refractive index increment from 0.0099 RIU/M to 0.04
RIU/M in the salt concentration from 0.4 to 0.8 M. Several features
of this sensing scheme, including high sensitivity, reproducibility,
stability, and fast response, have made stimuli-responsive hydrogel
integrated with LPFGs a novel and robust platform not only for salinity
sensor but also in other applications where sensitive and specific
salt measurements in aqueous solutions are important.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium hydroxide
standard solution (0.1 M, NaOH), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA, Mw ∼ 1.2 kDa), branched polyethylenimine
(BPEI, Mw = 750 kDa, Mn = 60 kDa), poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA, Mw = 60 kDa), poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP, Mw = 160 kDa) glutaraldehyde, sodium acetate buffer (NaOAc),
sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4), and disodium
phosphate (Na2HPO4) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Hydrochloric acid (1 N standard solution, HCl) was purchased from
Acros Organics. Hydrogen peroxide (30% in water, H2O2) was obtained from Fisher Scientific Inc. Cross-linkable
quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine) (qP4VP, 160 kDa) was synthesized,
as described in section 2.3. All chemicals were used without further
purification steps. All solutions were prepared using ultrapure water
(Milli-Q, <18.2 MΩ cm). For LbL deposition, qP4VP and PAA
solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer and adjusted to pH 6.5. The salinity solutions were
prepared by adding sodium chloride powder to the phosphate buffer
solutions at pH 8.1.

LPFGs Fabrication
The LPFGs were
fabricated using point-by-point
irradiation of a focused CO2 laser beam. The CO2 laser with a closed loop kit has excellent power stability (<1%)
to guarantee reproducible LPFGs structure. LPFGs were inscribed with
the aid of 120° Au-coated Si reflection mirror pair via a motorized
translation stage with 0.2 μm minimum incremental motion. The
entire LPFGs fabrication was controlled by computer interface to ensure
synchronized operations on laser irradiation and translation stage.
The employed optical fiber was SMF-28 (from Corning Optical Communications
Inc.). The LPFGs coupled with LP0,10 cladding mode were
fabricated with parameters of 247 μm in period and 5 cm in length.
A broadband light source was connected to one end of the LPFGs and
an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) to the other for the measurement
of the transmission spectra of the LPFGs in real time during the fabrication
process.

Synthesis of Cross-Linkable qP4VP
The synthesis of
cross-linkable quaternized qiP4VP polymers,
where i is the percentage of the quaternized groups,
was performed in several steps, as illustrated in Scheme 1. At the first step, a small
number (∼5%) of Boc-protected cross-linkable groups were introduced
in the polymer to yield P4VP-p. At the second step, the polymer was
quaternized with ethyl bromide to a desired degree of quaternization i to obtain Boc-protected qiP4VP-p. Finally, the protecting Boc groups were removed to yield
qiP4VP containing a fraction of amino
groups, which could be used to chemically cross-link the polycation
after its assembly within LbL films.

Scheme 1 Two-Step Quaternization
of P4VP To Obtain a Cross-Linkable qiP4VP
Used in the LbL Assembly
A Schlenk flask was sequentially filled with 1.50 g of
poly(4-vinylpyridine),
0.107 g of 2-(Boc-amino) ethyl bromide, and 30.0 mL of anhydrous methanol.
The solution was degassed by three freeze–thaw cycles, transferred
into a round-bottom flask with a reflux condenser, and then refluxed
on an oil bath overnight under argon atmosphere. The solution was
cooled to ambient temperature, and 4.0 mL of ethyl bromide was added.
The mixture was refluxed on an oil bath for 2–6 h. During that
time, 5.0 mL aliquots were sampled at 120, 180, 190, 220, 240, 300,
and 360 min of the reaction time. All of the samples were frozen in
liquid nitrogen to stop the reaction and dried under vacuum. The resultant
varying degrees of quaternization of the protected polymers were determined
using 1H NMR.

The deprotection procedure was performed
as follows. qiP4VP-p (0.150 g) was dissolved
in 5.0 mL of methanol
in a Schlenk flask. The solution was degassed by three freeze–thaw
cycles, and 1.0 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added drop-by-drop
using a syringe. The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 1 h under
argon atmosphere, dried under vacuum, and kept in a vacuum desiccator
filled with Drierite overnight.

The hydrogels with various quaternization
degrees were deprotected
and deposited onto silicon substrates, 37% quaternization of qP4VP
hydrogel exhibited the highest sensitivity in the region of salt concentration
from 0.4 to 0.8 M, and it was selected to construct the hydrogel via
LbL on LPFGs.

Hydrogel Deposition on LPFGs
LPFGs
were mounted and
fastened between two holders on an optical stage. It was dipped into
a container with a V-shaped groove holding the polyelectrolyte solutions
during the LbL assembly. The LPFGs were cleaned with 7.5% H2O2 solution for 20 min, followed by thorough rinsing with
deionized water, then were dipped to polyelectrolyte solutions with
the application of three consecutive 1 min rinsing cycles in 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer after each polymer adsorption step.

The entire procedure of hydrogel preparation is shown in Scheme 2. Prior to q37P4VP/PAA film construction, a prime two-bilayer BPEI/PMAA
film was deposited on the LPFGs and annealed at 140 °C for 30
min. The q37P4VP/PAA LbL film was then deposited on LPFGs
by sequential dipping in 0.2 mg/mL of q37P4VP and PAA solutions
for 5 min at pH 6.5. The deposition was repeated for 150 cycles, yielding
a [BPEI/PMAA]2–[q37P4VP/PAA]150 multilayer. The multilayer was then cross-linked via a 30 min exposure
to 0.1 mg/mL of glutaraldehyde buffer solution at pH 6.5. After cross-linking,
the assembled PAA was selectively released from the film upon exposure
to 2.0 M NaCl solution at pH 7.5 overnight.

Scheme 2 Fabrication of a
q37P4VP Hydrogel Coating
1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR)
Spectrometry
The quaternization degree of qiP4VP polymers was determined using a VARIAN Mercury 300
NMR spectrometer using D2O as a solvent. The data were
processed with a VarianJ software.

Fourier-Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
spectra were recorded using a Bruker Tensor II spectrometer equipped
with an mercury cadmium telluride detector by accumulation of 96 scans
within a spectral range of 1900–900 cm–1 at
a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Spectroscopic Ellipsometry
Refractive indices and thicknesses
of LbL films deposited on silicon wafer were determined using a variable
angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000, J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.)
equipped with a temperature-controlled liquid cell. Dry measurements
were performed at four incidence angles: 45, 55, 65, and 75°.
The measurements in the liquid cell required the angle of incidence
of 70° because of specific cell geometry. Thickness of native
oxide on silicon wafer was measured prior to depositing LbL films.

For fitting of ellipsometric data of dry films, a three-layer model
was used where the first two layers are silicon substrate and oxide
layer. Third layer was characterized as a Cauchy material with a thickness d. The dependence of refractive index was stated as n (λ) = A + B/λ2 + C/λ4, where λ is
wavelength; A, B, and C are coefficients.49 For the fitting of
swollen film data, a four-layer model was used where three layers
are considered as dry films, and solution environment was considered
as the fourth layer. It was characterized as a semi-infinite transparent
Cauchy medium with fixed refractive index value. The refractive index
of each solution was determined prior to each measurement for a bare
silicon wafer installed to liquid cell. All four variables A, B, C, and thickness
d were fitted simultaneously to get the closest theoretical description
of the experimental data.
