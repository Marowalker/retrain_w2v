Gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with antibodies have
the potential to improve biosensing technology because of the unique
optical properties of AuNPs and the specificity of antibody–antigen
interactions. Critical to the development and optimization of these
AuNP-enabled sensing technologies is the immobilization of the antibody
onto the AuNP. The development of novel immobilization strategies
that optimize antibody loading and orientation in an effort to enhance
antibody activity, and therefore assay performance, has been the focus
of many recent studies. However, few analytical methods exist to accurately
quantify the activity of conjugated antibodies and reliably compare
different immobilization strategies. Herein, we describe an enzyme-mediated
assay to quantify the fraction of the immobilized antibodies that
is accessible for antigen binding. Anti-horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP)
antibody is mixed with AuNPs to allow for conjugation, and the unbound,
excess antibody is quantified with a modified Bradford assay to determine
antibody loading onto AuNPs. The conjugates are then mixed with excess
HRP to saturate all accessible binding sites, and bound HRP is quantified
based on enzymatic reaction rate. This analytical scheme was used
to compare two common immobilization strategies, nonspecific adsorption
and protein A-mediated immobilization. We found that the antibody
surface coverage is greater for direct adsorption than protein A-mediated
binding; however, 23 ± 6% of the directly adsorbed antibodies
were active, whereas 91 ± 19% of the antibodies bound through
protein A were active. In addition to establishing this method as
quantitatively precise and accurate, our results emphasize the need
to quantify both antibody loading and antibody activity upon conjugation
to gain greater insight into differences in immobilization chemistries
and identify optimum protein conjugation strategies to maximize immunoassay
performance.

1 Introduction
Antibody
(Ab) immobilization onto gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) greatly
affects Ab–antigen binding and is critical to the success of
AuNP-enabled immunoassays. It has been established that the antigen-binding
capacity correlates with the number of accessible Fab domains.1−7 Thus, immobilized Ab surface coverage and orientation govern the
analytical performance of these assays. Not surprisingly, then, several
conjugation methods have been explored in search of an optimal immobilization
protocol;8−14 however, analytical tools to accurately assess Ab loading and orientation
are needed to compare different coupling chemistries on AuNPs.

Several instrumental methods have been developed to compare immobilization
chemistries for planar surfaces.13 Atomic
force microscopy,15,16 mass spectrometry (time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry),17,18 dual polarization
interferometry,6,19 neutron reflectometry,19 spectroscopic ellipsometry,19−21 and total internal
reflection ellipsometry22−24 have all been used to assess
Ab orientation, surface coverage, and binding capacity on planar surfaces.
However, these methods are not suitable for the analysis of AuNPs,
and relatively few approaches have been developed for the analysis
of Ab immobilization on AuNPs. Ab immobilization chemistry onto AuNPs
is often empirically evaluated by comparing the activity of the Ab–AuNP
conjugate in a functional assay. Conjugates formed using different
immobilization chemistries have been incorporated into enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays,9,14 lateral flow assays,12 and aggregation-based assays,9,25 and
improvements in the detection limit of those assays were attributed
to proper orientation of the Ab. However, this approach is limited
in that it does not account for differences in Ab loading density
and can result in an inappropriate interpretation. An increase in
conjugate activity can result from proper Ab orientation or optimal
loading density on the AuNP surface. Conversely, novel immobilization
chemistries that lead to properly oriented immobilization may result
in a decreased assay performance if coupling efficiency is poor. Thus,
both the loading density and accessible binding sites must be measured
quantitatively so that differences in Ab orientation can be evaluated
and immobilization chemistries can be systematically compared.

Few studies have been reported that provide information on both
the activity and accessibility of Abs immobilized on nanoparticles.
Recently, Saha et al. utilized radioisotope (125I)-labeled
Abs to accurately quantify the total Abs immobilized onto the AuNP,
followed by 125I-labeled secondary Ab or protein G, to
gain insight into the accessibility of the Fab domain and Ab orientation.5 In this work, we immobilized anti-horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) onto AuNPs and capitalized on the enzymatic activity
of the antigen to quantify the fraction of immobilized Abs that is
active toward antigens. This enzyme-mediated assay has been previously
explored as a semiquantitative method to compare relative amounts
of immobilized Abs.10 Anti-HRP and an enzymatic
assay were used by Puertas et al. to evaluate Ab loading and antigen
binding capacity on larger magnetic particles;12 however, the focus of that study was to evaluate the effects
of immobilization conditions rather than the analytical method and
precise quantitative information was not provided. In this report,
we establish an enzyme-based analytical method that provides precision
and sensitivity to quantitatively evaluate different immobilization
chemistries on AuNPs. Moreover, we believe that this method can be
easily implemented as a standardized approach to directly compare
immobilization strategies.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Overview
We have selected two common
methods to immobilize Abs onto AuNPs in an effort to develop and apply
a comprehensive analytical approach to compare immobilization
methods (Figure 1A).
First, Abs were directly adsorbed onto AuNPs. This strategy relies
on hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and electrostatic interactions between
the Ab and AuNP surface to form the conjugate.26−28 A more recent
investigation also suggests that chemisorption through the cysteine
thiol moiety is responsible for direct adsorption.29 Regardless of the interaction mechanism, this strategy
does not control the orientation of the immobilized Ab. In a second
approach to form Ab–AuNP conjugates, we utilized protein
A to mediate the immobilization of the Ab onto AuNPs. This strategy
results in appropriately oriented immobilization in which the antigen-binding
sites of the Ab are directed toward the solution and are accessible
for interacting with the antigen.

Figure 1 Immobilization strategies to prepare Ab–AuNP
conjugates
which include nonspecifically adsorbed Ab for random orientation and
Ab immobilization via protein A for controlled orientation (A). Illustration
of the analytical approach to quantify both the number of Abs bound
to each AuNP and the number of active binding sites presented by the
immobilized Ab (B). Analysis of the supernatant containing the excess
unbound Ab allows for quantitation of the number of adsorbed Abs on
each AuNP. Active binding sites on the immobilized Ab are then saturated
with HRP, and an enzymatic reaction enables quantitation of available
binding sites presented by the immobilized Abs.

The general approach to quantify the surface concentration
and orientation of the immobilized Ab is illustrated in Figure 1B. Anti-HRP is an
ideal Ab in this analytical scheme because it provides a straightforward
means to quantify accessible antigen-binding sites, that is, Ab orientation,
by the enzymatic activity of the bound HRP antigen. Briefly, excess
Ab is added to the AuNP suspension and allowed to saturate the AuNP
surface. Excess unbound Ab is quantified using a modified Bradford
assay, and the surface concentration of the immobilized Abs is calculated
as the difference between the total Ab added and the excess Ab remaining
in the supernatant. The Ab–AuNP conjugates are then reacted
with excess HRP to saturate accessible binding sites on the immobilized
Abs. The number of captured HRP is quantitatively correlated with
the enzymatic activity via external calibration using standard solutions
of HRP.

2.2 Characterization of Ab–AuNP Conjugates
UV–visible spectrophotometry and nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA) were used to monitor the immobilization of Abs onto AuNPs. Unconjugated
AuNPs exhibited an extinction maximum at 534 nm (Figure 2). A slight red shift in the
extinction maximum to 538 nm was observed upon direct adsorption of
anti-HRP Ab onto the AuNPs. This spectral shift resulted from a change
in the local refractive index due to the protein adlayer and is consistent
with previous reports.30 The hydrodynamic
diameter also increased from 63.4 ± 0.4 to 75.9 ± 1.6 nm
after direct adsorption of the Ab to the AuNP and is characteristic
of a single IgG adlayer (Table S1).31−33 A second AuNP conjugate was formed by the chemisorption of thiolated
protein A onto the AuNP followed by affinity coupling of anti-HRP
Ab. The extinction maxima for the protein A and protein A/anti-HRP
Ab conjugates were located at 536 and 539 nm, respectively, and the
hydrodynamic diameters measured 85.5 ± 1.3 and 95.5 ± 1.2
nm, respectively. It is worth noting that the thickness of the protein
A layer is greater than that of the Ab layer. Protein A is a rodlike
protein with a length of ∼25–30 nm, which was previously
shown to adsorb onto AuNPs at 26° with respect to the surface
normal for an overall increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of 22–24
nm.32,33 Thus, the 22.1 nm increase in size for the
protein A-modified AuNP relative to the unconjugated AuNP is consistent
with these previously reported values. The hydrodynamic diameter increased
10.0 ± 1.8 nm after the addition of the Ab to the protein A-modified
AuNP and is similar to the 12.5 ± 1.6 nm increase in size observed
for direct adsorption of Abs onto AuNPs. A third AuNP sample was modified
with thiolated PEG1000. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification of
AuNPs has been shown to improve colloidal stability and minimize nonspecific
protein binding;34 thus, PEG–AuNPs
were prepared to serve as a negative control for antigen binding studies.
PEG-functionalized AuNPs displayed an extinction maximum at 535 nm
and a hydrodynamic diameter of 70.1 ± 1.4 nm. This observed increase
in hydrodynamic diameter of 6.7 nm is consistent with a previous report
measuring an increase of 7.2 nm for a PEG900 adlayer on AuNPs by dynamic
light scattering.34 These red shifts in
extinction maxima and increases in hydrodynamic diameters, relative
to unconjugated AuNPs, confirmed surface modification of AuNPs.

UV–visible spectrophotometry to monitor surface modification.
Extinction spectra are provided for unconjugated AuNPs, Ab-modified
AuNPs, protein A-modified AuNPs, protein A-modified AuNPs with a bound
Ab, and PEG1000-modified AuNPs.

2.3 Quantitation of the Abs Immobilized on AuNPs
As mentioned above, the Ab loading density is an essential parameter
that must be measured quantitatively so that differences in Ab orientation
can be evaluated and immobilization chemistries can be systematically
compared. To this end, a modified Bradford assay was performed on
the supernatant collected after a 1 h incubation of the anti-HRP Ab
with unconjugated and protein A-modified AuNPs. Standard solutions
of anti-HRP were used to generate a calibration curve to quantify
the excess Ab in the supernatant (Figure S1). The number of Ab molecules adsorbed onto the AuNPs was calculated
as the difference between the initial concentration of the Ab added
to the AuNPs and the unbound Ab in the supernatant (Table S2). It should be noted that any loss of Ab due to adsorption
onto the sample vial, for example, a microcentrifuge tube, would result
in a systematic error that overestimates Ab loading onto the AuNP.
To minimize this potential error, calibration standards were incubated
in centrifuge tubes for the same time as the AuNP sample, and several
low-binding microcentrifuge tubes were evaluated to select the product
with minimal protein adsorption. A total of 24 independent AuNP samples,
12 conjugates formed via direct adsorption to AuNPs and 12 conjugates
prepared with protein A-modified AuNPs, were analyzed. Direct adsorption
of the Ab onto AuNPs resulted in a loading of 227 ± 35 Abs/AuNP.
Theoretical monolayer coverage calculated based on the size of an
Ab molecule would result in a surface density of ∼90 Ab/AuNP
for side-on orientation and ∼330 Ab/AuNP for end-on orientation.7,35,36 Thus, the measured value of 227
± 35 Abs/AuNP falls within the expected range for monolayer coverage.
To confirm full monolayer coverage and the absence of multilayers,
the concentration of Abs added to the AuNP suspension was varied.
Supernatant analysis as a function of added Ab confirms that Ab loading
maximized at ∼225 Abs/AuNP (Figure S2). The hydrodynamic diameter of the conjugates was also measured
as a function of Ab concentration by NTA to evaluate the adsorbed
Ab layer. Figure S3 demonstrates that the
hydrodynamic diameter of the conjugates increased to a maximum of
∼71 nm and is consistent with a single layer of Ab.31,32

Ab loading onto protein A-modified AuNPs resulted in 68 ±
10 Abs/AuNP, which was significantly lower than that for direct adsorption.
The decrease in Ab binding to protein A-modified AuNPs relative to
direct adsorption onto AuNPs is likely the result of two factors.
First, protein A is a rodlike protein with a long dimension of 25–30
nm.37 The size and shape of protein A leads
to a larger effective footprint than IgG to result in fewer immobilized
molecules on the AuNP; thus, there were fewer surface binding sites
on the protein A-modified AuNP compared to an unmodified AuNP for
Abs to attach. Second, protein A may not be properly oriented to bind
the Fc region of the Ab, thus limiting access to Ab immobilization
sites on the AuNP surface. This analysis highlights the variability
in Ab loading among conjugation chemistries and underscores the need
to quantify immobilized Abs when evaluating and comparing immobilization
strategies.

2.4 Quantitation of Ab Binding
Sites
Excess HRP was added to the Ab–AuNP conjugates
to saturate
all accessible antigen-binding sites for the immobilized Abs. On the
basis of the maximum loading density of the Ab for the Ab–AuNP
conjugates prepared via direct adsorption, 30-fold excess HRP was
added to ensure saturation. Moreover, equal quantities of HRP were
captured by the Ab–AuNP conjugates for both 1 h and overnight
(∼18 h) incubations to confirm that equilibrium was established
for the Ab–antigen interaction under these experimental conditions.
As illustrated in Figure 1B, the captured HRP was quantified by an enzymatic reaction
with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)
(ABTS). This analytical approach assumes that the enzymatic activity
of Ab-bound HRP captured on the conjugates is equivalent to that of
the free HRP used for external calibration. To confirm that HRP enzymatic
activity is not inhibited when bound by an Ab, two sets of standard
solutions were prepared, one consisting of free HRP and one consisting
of HRP to which Ab–AuNP conjugates were added. The HRP is complexed
to the Ab for the standard solutions in which Ab–AuNP conjugates
were added. ABTS was added to the standard solutions, and the enzymatic
reaction rate was determined from the absorbance of the formed product.
The reaction rate was plotted as a function of HRP concentration to
generate calibration curves (Figure 3), and the data established a linear correlation. Moreover,
the linear calibration curves were equivalent for the free HRP and
HRP captured by Ab–AuNP conjugates; thus, HRP captured by the
Ab–AuNP conjugates could be accurately quantified with external
calibration.

Figure 3 Calibration curves for HRP. The enzymatic reaction rate
of HRP
with ABTS is plotted as a function of HRP concentration. Calibration
was prepared with standard solutions of free HRP and HRP bound to
the Ab–AuNP conjugates.

Reaction rates for conjugates saturated with HRP are presented
in Figure 4. Both of
the Ab–AuNP conjugates resulted in a significant reaction rate,
whereas the PEG–AuNP conjugate provided a minimal reaction
rate. Signals for the Ab–AuNP conjugates were corrected by
subtracting the signal from that of the PEG–AuNP control conjugates
that was due to the baseline reaction rate in the absence of enzyme
and/or contribution of nonspecific HRP binding. Additional negative
control conjugates were prepared with IgG to further confirm the binding
specificity of the anti-HRP conjugate and validate the PEG-modified
AuNP as an accurate measure of nonspecific binding. Figure S4 demonstrates that only anti-HRP conjugates captured
HRP, whereas other IgG-modified AuNP conjugates demonstrated similar
nonspecific adsorption of HRP as the PEG–AuNP conjugate. The
quantity of Ab-captured HRP was calculated based on the calibration
curve and normalized with respect to conjugate concentration to determine
the number of captured HRP molecules per conjugate (Table 1). Extinction spectra were acquired
to experimentally measure the AuNP conjugate concentration for each
sample, which was critical because the AuNP concentration could vary
by as much as 20% as a result of 6–9 centrifugation/decant/resuspension
cycles (3 cycles after protein A immobilization, 3 cycles after Ab
immobilization, and 3 cycles after HRP binding). Interestingly, similar
numbers of HRP molecules were captured by the conjugates formed via
direct adsorption (104 ± 23 HRP/AuNP) and protein A-mediated
immobilization (124 ± 17 HRP/AuNP) given that significantly fewer
Abs were loaded onto the protein A conjugates (Table 1).

Figure 4 Quantitation of Ab-binding sites. AuNP conjugates
were saturated
with HRP and quantified based on the enzymatic reaction rate with
ABTS. Three conjugates were prepared: direct adsorption of anti-HRP
onto AuNPs, protein A-mediated immobilization of anti-HRP onto AuNPs,
and AuNPs modified with thiolated PEG1000 as a negative control.

The accuracy of this method to quantify
accessible binding sites
requires that all available binding sites are saturated with HRP and
that all excess HRP molecules are removed from the conjugate suspension.
To establish that these criteria were met, Ab–AuNP conjugates
were mixed with increasing amounts of HRP. The number of captured
HRP molecules increased as the amount of added HRP increased and reached
a maximum of ∼105 HRP/AuNP (Figure 5). These data confirm that all available
binding sites were saturated with HRP with the addition of 3 μg
of HRP used in previous experiments. A rinse study was performed to
verify that three centrifugation/resuspension rinse cycles were sufficient
to remove all unbound HRP molecules from the conjugate suspensions.
HRP (3 μg) was added to the negative control PEG conjugates,
and the number of centrifugation cycles to remove excess HRP from
the conjugates was varied. Figure S5 shows
that after two rinse cycles, nearly 98% of the HRP was removed from
the negative control conjugates and no benefit was achieved with more
than three rinse cycles, confirming that excess HRP was effectively
removed from the conjugates to accurately quantify the bound HRP molecules.

of captured HRP molecules as a function of added HRP
to determine the saturation of available binding sites presented by
immobilized Abs.

The fraction of immobilized
Abs with accessible antigen-binding
sites was calculated by combining both the measured number of immobilized
Abs per AuNP and captured HRP per AuNP (Table 1). Conjugates formed via direct adsorption
loaded with 227 ± 35 Abs/AuNP provide a maximum of 454 antigen-binding
sites per AuNP, taking into account the divalency of IgG Abs; however,
each conjugate captured only 104 ± 23 HRP molecules. This suggests
that 23 ± 6% of the Ab-binding sites are properly oriented and
accessible to interact with the antigen. This value is consistent
with random orientation of the immobilized Ab and in agreement with
a study by Caruso, et al., which found 27 ± 7% of the binding
sites occupied by antigens for randomly oriented Abs immobilized on
smooth gold surfaces.38 Conversely, 68
± 10 Abs loaded onto each protein A-modified AuNP result in a
maximum of 136 antigen-binding sites per AuNP. Each protein A conjugate
captured 124 ± 17 HRP molecules, suggesting that 91 ± 19%
of the Ab-binding sites are properly oriented and accessible to interact
with the antigen. These results are consistent with previous work
by Puertas et al. that found that properly oriented anti-HRP can bind
two HRP molecules for 100% biding efficiency.12 Similarly, Tajima et al. demonstrated that protein A binds the Fc
region of IgG to properly orient Abs, enabling the capture of 1.8
± 0.1 antigen molecules per Ab (90 ± 5% binding activity),
provided that the antigen is smaller than ∼100 kDa.39 Collectively, these results validate this analytical
approach as a comprehensive, robust, and accurate method to quantify
the fraction of immobilized Abs that maintains antigen-binding activity
and to compare immobilization strategies.

3 Conclusions
We have developed an accurate method that can be easily implemented
as a standardized approach to directly compare immobilization strategies.
We capitalized on the enzymatic activity of the target antigen to
develop an analytical approach to quantify the accessibility of the
active Ab conjugated to AuNPs. On the basis of previous work regarding
Ab orientation, we hypothesized that Ab–AuNP conjugates formed
with protein A to facilitate Ab immobilization would result in a greater
quantity of bound antigens and a larger fraction of accessible Abs
when compared to conjugates formed through nonspecific Ab–AuNP
interactions. In support of our hypothesis, we found a statistically
significant increase in antigen binding for the protein A-mediated
conjugate, although this improvement in antigen binding was less significant
than anticipated based on previous work.17,39 More notably, significantly more Abs were immobilized via nonspecific
adsorption than via protein A. Thus, taking into account both Ab loading
and captured antigen, we found that 23 ± 6% of nonspecifically
adsorbed Abs remained accessible and active, whereas 91 ± 19%
of Abs immobilized via protein A were accessible, thereby supporting
our hypothesis that protein A properly orients immobilized Abs to
promote antigen binding. These results highlight the need to quantify
both the Ab loading and activity to effectively evaluate immobilization
chemistries.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
AuNPs (60 nm) were purchased
from Ted Pella Inc. (Redding, CA). HRP, borate buffer, and ABTS (1-Step
ABTS) were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). The mouse
anti-HRP IgG monoclonal Ab (clone 2H11) was acquired from MyBioSource.
Thiolated protein A was purchased from Protein Mods LLC (Madison,
WI). Thiol-modified polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG 1000) was purchased
from Creative PEGWorks (Durham, NC). Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent
concentrate was acquired from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Hercules,
CA). All aqueous solutions were prepared in NANO pure deionized water
(18 MΩ) from a Barnstead water purification system (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL).

4.2 Synthesis of Ab–AuNP
Conjugates
4.2.1 Direct Ab Immobilization (Nonoriented)
AuNPs (60 nm; 100 μL) were placed into a low-binding microcentrifuge
tube, and 4 μL of 50 mM borate buffer was added to adjust the
pH of the suspension to 8.0. The mouse anti-HRP monoclonal Ab (4 μg)
was added to the AuNP suspension and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C
to allow for direct adsorption. After incubation, the functionalized
AuNPs were centrifuged at 5000g for 5 min, the supernatant
was decanted, and the pelleted nanoparticles were resuspended in 2
mM borate buffer (pH 8.0). The supernatant of the first centrifugation
was collected for protein analysis to infer the quantity of the Abs
immobilized on the AuNPs. The functionalized AuNPs were subsequently
centrifuged/resuspended twice more to thoroughly remove excess Abs.

4.2.2 Protein A-Mediated Ab Immobilization (Oriented)
The pH of AuNPs (60 nm) was adjusted to pH 8.0 with the addition
of 50 mM borate buffer to a final concentration of 2 mM. AuNPs were
then incubated with 2 μg of thiolated protein A for 1 h at 4
°C. Excess protein A was removed by three centrifugation/washing
cycles at 5000g for 5 min. During each wash, the
supernatant was removed and the pelleted AuNPs were resuspended in
2 mM borate buffer (pH 8.0). To the protein A-modified AuNPs, 4 μg
of mouse anti-HRP Ab was added and allowed to incubate for 1 h at
4 °C. The functionalized AuNPs were then centrifuged at 5000g for 5 min and the pelleted AuNPs resuspended in 2 mM borate
buffer three times to remove the excess Ab. The supernatant of the
first wash was collected for the Ab quantitation.

4.2.3 PEG-Modified AuNPs
For control
studies, AuNPs were modified with thiolated PEG1000. To this end,
15 μL of 20 μM thiol-PEG1000 was incubated with 100 μL
of 60 nm AuNPs and 4 μL of 50 mM borate buffer (pH 8.0) for
1 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the PEG-modified AuNPs were
washed to remove excess PEG by three centrifugation/washing cycles
at 5000g for 5 min.

4.3 Quantitation
of Abs Conjugated to AuNPs
The number of Abs immobilized
onto AuNPs was determined using a
modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). Standard solutions
of anti-HRP Ab (0–50 μg/mL) were prepared in 2 mM borate
buffer (pH 8.0). Ab–AuNP conjugates and the standard solutions
were centrifuged at 5000g for 5 min, and 90 μL
of the supernatant or standard solution was transferred to a 96-well
plate. Each sample and standard was diluted with 70 μL of 2
mM borate buffer (pH 8.0), followed by the addition of 40 μL
of the Bio-Rad reagent. The samples and standards were then incubated
at room temperature for 10–15 min to allow the color to develop.
UV–visible absorption was measured at 595 nm to quantify the
Abs in the supernatant. For lower concentrations of Abs (0–7
μg/mL), the microassay protocol was required. The microassay
calls for the addition of 200 μL of Bio-Rad reagent to 800 μL
of sample or standard solutions, followed by an absorption measurement
in a 1 cm sample cell. The total number of Ab molecules adsorbed onto
the AuNPs was calculated as the difference between the number of Ab
molecules added to the AuNP suspension and the number of Abs that
remained in the supernatant.

4.4 Quantitation of Ab Binding
Sites
The AuNP conjugates were incubated with 3 μL
of 1 mg/mL HRP
for 1 h to saturate all active Ab binding sites. The excess HRP was
removed by three centrifugation/wash cycles at 5000g for 5 min. A 10 μL aliquot of the conjugate was mixed with
150 μL of 1-Step ABTS substrate solution, and the enzymatic
reaction rate was determined from the absorbance of the formed product
at 415 nm. Linear correlation between the concentration of HRP and
the enzymatic reaction rate allows the quantification of the number
of captured HRP on the AuNP conjugates via calibration with standard
solutions of HRP.

4.5 Instrumentation
4.5.1 UV–Visible Spectrophotometer
The extinction
spectra of the unconjugated and surface-modified AuNPs
were acquired with a Cary 1 Bio UV–visible dual-beam spectrophotometer.
The slit was set to 0.2 nm, and measurements were collected at 0.5
nm increments over a range of 400–900 nm. A Bio-Rad, iMark
Microplate Reader was used for high-throughput, simultaneous collection
of absorbance data required for the Bio-Rad protein assay and the
HRP–ABTS enzymatic reaction. To quantify the Abs in the AuNP
supernatant via the Bio-Rad protein assay, the absorbance at 595 nm
was measured. The iMark Microplate Reader was set to collect the absorbance
at 415 nm at 10 s intervals for a total of 20 min to determine the
HRP–ABTS enzymatic reaction rate.

4.5.2 Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis
Hydrodynamic diameters for the conjugates
were measured with a NanoSight
LM10 NTA system configured with an LM14 532 nm laser module and a
high-sensitivity sCMOS camera. Samples were prepared at ∼109 nanoparticles/mL, and the analysis was performed under a
constant flow (15 μL/min) for improved sampling. The hydrodynamic
diameter for each sample was based on the analysis of five 60 s videos,
using a camera level of 7 and a detection threshold set to a value
of 5. Using these video settings, approximately 10 000 individual
nanoparticles were analyzed for each sample to calculate a mean size
and standard deviation.
