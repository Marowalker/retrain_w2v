A new series of hydrogen-bonded metallotecton
networks 6–9 of the general formula [M(2)2(NO3)2] were obtained from the
reaction of 6-pyridin-2-yl-[1,3,5]-triazine-2,4-diamine 2 with transition-metal ions [M: Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)].
Their supramolecular networks and associated properties were characterized
by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, IR, solid-state UV–vis
spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis associated with differential
scanning calorimetry. On the basis of standard patterns of coordination
involving 2,2′-bipyridine and simple derivatives, compound 2 binds transition-metal ions with predictable constitution
and the diaminotriazinyl (DAT) groups serve orthogonally to ensure
the intermetallotecton interactions by hydrogen bonding according
to well-established motifs I–III. As expected,
compound 2 formed octahedral 2:1 metallotectons with
M(NO3)2, and further self-assembled by hydrogen
bonding of the DAT groups to produce pure, crystalline, homogeneous,
and thermally stable materials. In these structures, nitrate counterions
also play an important role in the cohesion of intermetallotectons
to form two-dimensional and three-dimensional networks. These results
illustrated the effectiveness of the synthetic approach to create
a wide range of novel ordered materials with controllable architectures
and tunable properties achieved by varying the central metal ion.
Crystal morphologies of 6–9 were also investigated
by scanning electron microscopy and calculation using Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker
method from their single-crystal structure.

Introduction
Enhancements
and innovations in the fields of chemistry, physics, and engineering
have provided a better understanding of the structure–property
relationships in several classes of materials. As a result, considerable
effort has been made to develop strategies to precisely control the
chemical composition and the structure to tailor properties of novel
materials. Among others, ordered materials have attracted much attention
due to their importance in numerous technological fields such as catalysis,
photovoltaics, batteries, nanotechnology, and so forth.1−3 A common approach to prepare well-defined structures is based on
the concept of crystal engineering in which molecular components with
suitable topologies and ability to engage in multiple predictable
interactions with neighbors produce reliable patterns.4,5 Even though reliable methods have been used to create ordered materials,
it should be noted that the synthesis of the molecular components
is usually not trivial. Thus, a hybrid approach, combining both inorganic
and organic chemistry, is exploited to produce ordered materials driven
by the self-assembly of organic units linked by coordination to metal
ions and other directional forces.6−10 This approach has numerous advantages: (i) it allows to prepare
molecular crystals with high yields; (ii) the self-assemblies are
predictable; (iii) ordered materials with various properties owing
to the presence of transition metal ions are developed; and (iv) the
supramolecular networks and properties can be easily tuned by varying
the metal center.

In coordination chemistry, ligand like 2,2′-bipyridine
(1 = 2,2′-bipy) has been widely used due to its
chelating ability (in self-assembly with metal ions) to form predictable
coordination complexes.11−17 Many functional materials with 2,2′-bipy and related ligands
have been developed and applied to material separation/purification,
catalysis, and ions exchange.18−23 However, these materials are comparatively difficult to prepare
because their syntheses are laborious. In addition, crystal structures
with 2,2′-bipy complexes are not predictable due to lack of
functional groups to direct the self-assembly.

Of special interest
are diaminotriazinyl-substituted pyridine, pyrazine, and pyrimidine 2–4, a family of compounds that can engage in predictable
intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds and can simultaneously
bind metal ions according to reliable patterns (Scheme 1).24−31 Because of this dual ability, they were called tectoligands.31 In crystal engineering, the self-assembly of
tectoligands with metal ions produces metallotectons.32,33

Here, we report the
synthesis and the solid-state characterizations of a new series of
crystalline materials 6–9 obtained under mild
reaction conditions by the
assembly of 2 with Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)
ions (Scheme 2b). By
focusing on a single tectoligand with a predictable behavior, bound
with various transition metal ions, we designed our study to produce
wide range of ordered materials with closely related structures to
reveal the principles of the molecular construction based on the metallotectonic
approach.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses
and Characterization
To evaluate the potential of the hybrid
approach to form various molecular crystals, we have chosen to study
the behavior of 2 to bind transition-metal ions (Co(II),
Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) that have d7 to d10 electronic configurations. Compound 2 is basically
an organic compound consisting of a diamino-1,3,5-triazinyl group
(DAT) and a pyridine, which are known as the building blocks of many
inorganic materials and biological molecules.34−43 In this work, we focused on M(NO3)2 salts
because nitrate ions can engage in multiple hydrogen bonding, which
can strengthen the supramolecular networks. 6-(Pyridin-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine 2 was prepared by reported methods.44 The reaction of 2 and metal(II) nitrate in methanol
produces metallotectons 6–9, which were crystallized
by slow diffusion in MeOH/Et2O in good yields. As a result,
structures of 6–9 reflect intra- and intermetallotecton
interactions and multiple strong hydrogen bonds characteristic of
DAT groups.

Three-Dimensional Molecular and Supramolecular
Structure
Crystal Structures of 6 and 7
Crystals of 6 grown from MeOH/Et2O are pink. They belong to the orthorhombic
space group Fdd2. Views of the structure are shown
in Figure 1. Other
crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. The structure of 6, with 2:1
pyDAT-to-Co ratio, is Co(pyDAT)2(NO3)2. The cobalt atom coordinated with two pyDAT and two nitrate ions
form a cis-conformation (Figure 1a). The metallotecton 6 has a strongly
distorted octahedral geometry. This coordination geometry is reinforced
by intramolecular hydrogen bonds N–H···O involving
oxygen atoms of the nitrate and adjacent NH2 group (2.917(4)
Å). The average distance of Co–N and Co–ONO2 in the metallotecton is normal (2.131(4) and 2.146(3) Å,
respectively).45 The Co atom and one pair
of coordinated N atoms of the triazine rings of different pyDAT ligands
form almost a straight line, with a N2–Co–N2i angle of 167.4(2)°. In contrast, the other
coordinated pair of N atoms of the pyridine rings is not linear, with
a N1–Co–N1i angle of
109.0(2)°. The pyridine and DAT rings in both ligands are tilted
around the C–C bond by 12.6°. The average plane of bound
ligands forms an angle of 57.9°. As expected, the DAT groups
in metallotecton 6 are placed in trans-orientation. In
the structure, each DAT group is linked by two N–H···N
hydrogen bonds of type IV (Scheme 3, distance N–H···N
= 3.104(5) Å), giving rise to a three-dimensional network (Figure 1b). Additional N–H···O
hydrogen bonds involving nitrates and free NH2 groups reinforced
the supramolecular network. Details of the hydrogen bonds and their
angles are provided in Table S1.

otherwise, carbon atoms are shown in gray, hydrogen atoms in white,

The reaction of 2 with nickel(II) nitrate
2:1 ratio in methanol subsequently crystallized from MeOH/Et2O produced cyan crystals of 7. The crystal structure
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction is isostructural to 6. Views of the structure of 7 are shown in Figure S3. Other crystallographic data are given
in Table 1. The structural
formula of metallotecton 7 consists of Ni(pyDAT)2(NO3)2. The nickel atom is coordinated
with pyDAT and nitrates similarly to 6 (Ni–N and
Ni–ONO2 average distances are 2.092(5) and 2.125(5)
Å, respectively). In the structure of 7, the N2–Ni–N2i angle is 170.5(3)°,
which is slightly different from that of 6. Selected
hydrogen bonds and their angles are provided in Table S2.

Crystal Structure of 8
The blue
crystals of 8 grown from MeOH/Et2O proved
to belong to the monoclinic space group P21/c and have
the composition Cu(pyDAT)2(NO3)2. Figure 2 shows the views
of the structure. Other crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. The metallotecton 8 with a 2:1 pyDAT-to-Cu ratio consists of [(pyDAT)2Cu]2+ cation and two nitrate anions in trans-fashion (Figure 2a). The cationic
[(pyDAT)2Cu]2+ is flattened, and the average
plane of bound ligands forms an angle of 39.8°. The copper(II)
atom is coordinated to two pyDAT and two nitrate ions. The copper
coordination polyhedron can be described as a strongly distorted octahedron.
This coordination geometry is reinforced by intramolecular N–H···O
hydrogen bonds involving oxygen atoms and NH2 groups. In
the metallotecton 8, the average Cu–N bonds length
is 2.005(1) Å. The two nitrates are coordinated in an apical
position with Cu–O nonequal bond lengths of 2.457(3) and 2.845(4)
Å. These values are within the 2.4–2.9 Å range and
consistent with an axial elongation caused by a Jahn–Teller
distortion of the octahedral geometry of Cu(II).46,47 The observed structure consists of enantiomeric metallotectons of 8, which are linked alternatively into chains joined via characteristic
N–H···N hydrogen bonds of DAT groups according
to the motif I (Figure 2b). The average N–H···N distances
in hydrogen-bonded pairs of DAT groups (3.073(6) Å) have normal
values.48 The chains are held together
by π-stacking of DAT groups and pyridyl rings to form sheets
(average distance 3.988 Å). The sheets are reinforced by additional
N–H···O hydrogen bonds involving oxygen atoms
of nitrate and NH2 groups that are simultaneously engaged
in hydrogen bonding according to motif I. Packing of
the sheets directly by multiple N–H···O hydrogen
bonds involving nitrate and free NH2 groups produce the
three-dimensional structure (Figure 2c). Selected hydrogen bonds and their angles are given
in Table S3.

clarity, layers are marked in green and blue.

Crystal Structure of 9
The reaction of zinc nitrate
with 2 in a ratio of 1:2 produced 9 in high
yield. Colorless crystals of 9 grown from MeOH/Et2O proved to belong to the monoclinic space group C2/c and have the composition
Zn(pyDAT)2(NO3)2. Views of the structure
are shown in Figure 3, and additional crystallographic data are given in Table 1. The observed structure incorporates
enantiomer of metallotectons. The coordination around the zinc atom
in 9 is identical to that in metallotectons 6 and 7 (Figure 3a). The average plane of bound ligands in cationic [(pyDAT)2Zn]2+ forms an angle of 57.3° and the two
DAT groups are in trans orientation. The zinc atom can be considered
as having a distorted octahedral geometry. Within each ligand, the
triazine and pyridine rings are almost coplanar, and the average planes
form angles of 12.9 and 17.6°. The nitrogen atoms of two different
DATs are axially coordinated with an almost linear N2–Zn–N2i angle of 168.3°. The pyridine rings are
in an equatorial position with the N1–Zn–N1i angle of 114.3°. The distances Zn–N
in the metallotecton 9 are normal (average distance 2.160
Å).49 The average distance of the
Zn–O bond is 2.181(1) Å. This suggests that nitrates are
strongly coordinated to the metal ion. Details of the hydrogen bonds
and their angles are summarized in Table S4. In the structure of 9, the trans orientation of the
DAT groups allows pairing of metallotectons by the formation of four
hydrogen bonds according to motif I (average N–H···N
distance = 3.019(2) Å) to form chains. With the assistance of
hydrogen bonds involving nitrate and free NH2 groups (average
distance N–H···O = 2.945(5) Å), the chains
are held together to form sheets (Figure 3b). These sheets pack via π-stacking
to produce the observed three-dimensional structure (Figure 3c).

structure of 9 grown from MeOH/Et2O. Hydrogen
bonds are represented by dashed lines. Unless stated otherwise, carbon
atoms are shown in gray, hydrogen atoms in white, oxygen atoms in

nitrates to form the two-dimensional (2D) sheet. (c) View showing
sheets packed together to form the three-dimensional structure. For
clarity, layers are marked in red and blue.

It should be noted that although metallotectons in (6 and 7) and 9 have identical coordination
geometry and topology, the supramolecular networks resulting from
the same crystallization condition (MeOH/Et2O) provide
different association motifs of DAT groups. Comparison of the structures
of 9 and [Zn(2)2(N3)2] reported from the literature50 shows similar association motifs of DAT groups. However, the replacement
of azide ions by nitrate ions generates different cohesion of adjacent
sheets, which play an important role in the self-assembly.

Together,
crystal structures of 6–9 and [Zn(2)2(N3)2] indicate that the molecular
organization is dependent not only on the topology of metallotectons
but also on the integration of subtle details, which collectively
direct the supramolecular association.

Crystallinity, Purity,
and Homogeneity of Bulk Materials of 6–9
The evaluation
of homogeneity and phase purity is an important aspect in material
science. Indeed, in the crystallization process, the crystal growth
of a sample might result in a blend of several crystalline phases,
thereafter producing a sample with heterogeneous properties. Therefore,
we first verified the homogeneity and purity of 6–9 by elemental analysis (EA) (see the Experimental
Section). The compositions found by EA for each sample have
the general chemical formula M(C8H8N6)2(NO3)2 (M = CoII, NiII, CuII, or ZnII), which are consistent
with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Since we cannot confirm
the phase purity by EA, the bulk products of the as-grown crystals
of 6–9 were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD). Generally, due to the fragility of crystals outside of the
solvents of crystallization, the analysis by PXRD is difficult. In
our case, all crystals were stable outside the mother liquors. The
PXRD measurements in transmission mode for 6–9 confirmed the phase purity of products. Indeed, all peaks
of measured PXRD (in black) match well with the simulated (in red)
patterns (Figure 4).
This result demonstrate the absence of secondary phases for all samples.
The phase purity of 6–9 was reinforced by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), which confirms the absence of contaminations
by an amorphous phase that cannot be observed by PXRD (see Figure S8).

with simulated patterns (in red) calculated from single-crystal structures.
(a–d) 6–9, respectively.

Together, the XRD, PXRD, EA, and
SEM demonstrate that each bulk sample of 6–9 can
be prepared in a single-phase, pure, and crystalline forms.

Thermal
and Photophysical Properties
Thermal behaviors of 6–9 were determined using a combination of thermogravimetric analysis
and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA–DSC) measured simultaneously.
TGA and DSC curves of these compounds are shown in Figure 5. All samples were studied
from 35 to 800 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min under
air atmosphere.

Figure 5 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, black) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC, red) curves of 6–9.
(a–d) 6–9, respectively.

DSC curves of 6 and 7 showed a sharp exothermic peak at about 337 and 350 °C, respectively
(Figure 5a,b, red curves).
These are followed by exothermic peaks between 410 and 485 °C.
DSC curve measured for 8 displayed three small recognizable
exothermic peaks between 300 and 400 °C, followed by an intense
broad exothermic peak (Figure 5c, red curve). The DSC curve of 9 showed a sharp
exothermic peak at 345 °C, followed by broad exothermic peaks
(Figure 5d).

Compounds 6 and 7 have virtually the same
TG thermal decomposition curves (Figure 5a,b, black curves). Their DSC curves show
sharp exothermic peaks, which are associated to a pronounced loss
of mass of ∼44%. In the second decomposition step, a loss of
mass of the same magnitude is again observed to give the final residues.
TG curve of 8 displayed three distinguishable decomposition
steps in the 300–517 °C temperature range, with mass losses
of 13% for the first two and 49.4% for the last one (Figure 5c, black curve). Compound 9 decomposed in three steps between 345 and 592 °C (Figure 5d, black curve).
The first two decomposition steps occurred at 345–532 °C,
with a net loss of mass of ∼34% each. The third decomposition
step between 532 and 592 °C showed ∼25% loss of mass.
A summary of temperature ranges, mass losses (%) found and calculated,
and proposed assignment of decomposition of 6–9 determined by TGA are listed in Table S5.

Solid-state UV–vis spectra of 2 and 6–9 were measured at room temperature (Figure 6). The primary objective of
the investigation in solid state is to correlate the absorption bands
with the crystallographic data. Indeed, at liquid state, the geometry
of the transition-metal complex and the oxidation state of the metal
ion could be different from the single-crystal structure, which could
vary the electronic transitions.

Figure 6 Solid state UV–vis spectra of 2 and 6–9.

In solid state, the UV–vis spectrum of the free ligand 2 showed a strong absorption band at 320 nm, which is attributed
to the n–π* and π–π*
electron transitions typical of aromatic compounds. As excepted for 9, d–d transitions centered on the metal ion are observed
for 6–8. Because the electronic configuration
of Zn(II) is d10, all electrons in the d orbitals are paired;
therefore, d–d transitions do not occur for 9.
However, in the UV region of the spectrum of 9, two absorption
bands are observed at 321 and 331 nm. These bands can be attributed
to the electronic transitions centered to the ligand. Compounds 6–8 have electronic configurations of
d7, d8, and d9 for Co(II), Ni(II),
and Cu(II) ions, respectively. Their d orbitals are not fully occupied,
which allows d–d transitions to occur.51 In solid state, the absorption bands in the visible region of Co(pyDAT)2(NO3)2 in 6 are situated
at 560 and 478 nm, which may be assigned to ν1[4T1g(F) → 4T2g(F)]
and ν2[4T1g(F) → 4T1g(P)] transitions, respectively, in an idealized Oh symmetry. Those of Ni(pyDAT)2(NO3)2 in 7 are at 788
and 615 nm, which could be attributed to ν1[3A2g(F) → 3T2g(F)]
and ν2[3A2g(F) → 3T1g(F)] transitions, respectively, again in an Oh symmetry. That of Cu(pyDAT)2(NO3)2 in 8 is at 734 nm,
which may correspond to ν1[2Eg(D) → 2T2g(D)] transition, also in an Oh symmetry. All these absorption
bands are consistent with the spin-allowed d–d transitions
with an octahedral environment around the metal ions. In the UV region,
the absorption bands at (327 and 360 nm), (328, 347, and 380 nm),
and (325 and 372 nm) for 6–8, respectively,
are indicative of charge-transfer transitions occurring due to the
coordination of the ligands to metal ions. Comparing the solid-state
UV–vis spectrum of 2 with those of 6–9, we notice that when the same ligand is coordinated
to different metal ions with oxidation state +II, the electronic absorption
spectra of the metallotectons varied significantly due to the coordination
geometry and the different extranuclear electron distribution of the
metal ions.

Liquid UV–vis spectra of 2 and 6–9 in dimethyl sulfoxide solutions were measured at
room temperature at concentration 8.8 × 10–6 M (Figure S9). All spectra display similar
electronic transition in the UV region. However, the positions and
the intensities of the two absorption bands varies depending on the
metal ions. In the visible region, none of the typical d–d
electron transitions are observed for 6–9.

IR spectra were measured for samples 2 and 6–9 (Figure S10). The peak positions for
each spectrum are listed in Table S6 along
with their proposed assignments.

As the pyDAT molecule is coordinated
to metal ions, the vibration frequencies, intensities, and shapes
of the N–H, C–N, C=C, C–C, and C–H
bonds could change in the infrared absorption spectra of 6–9. Three factors, such as steric effect, field effect, and ring strain,
can contribute to the spatial effect.

In the 2000–600
cm–1 region, several metal-sensitive bands are observed.
The absorption bands between 680 and 700 cm–1 of 6–9 are sensitive to different metal ions. The main
difference between compounds 2 and 6–9 is a strong wide band appearing near 1270–1295 cm–1. This is assigned to the NO3– stretching
vibration. In the 3500–2800 cm–1 region,
the infrared spectra of 2 and 6–9 show typical broad bands characteristics of symmetric and asymmetric
N–H stretching of the NH2 groups. Positions and
intensities of these bands in 6–9 are different
from that of pyDAT, indicating different hydrogen bonding motifs of
the DAT groups. The infrared spectra of 6 and 7 are almost identical. This is due to their similar crystal structures.
Within the deformation region between 2000 and 600 cm–1, the infrared spectrum of 9 is almost the same as those
of 6 and 7. However, in the stretch region,
the absorption bands of NH2 groups are different from those
of 6 and 7. These observations can be explained
by the similar spatial configuration but the different intermolecular
hydrogen bonding motifs of the DAT groups of 6 and 9 (7 and 9, respectively). These
results concur with their crystal structures. The IR spectrum of 8 shows the characteristic vibrational bands of pyDAT and
nitrate counterions. The absorption bands are different from those
of 6, 7, and 9. This result
is in good agreement with the crystallographic data.

Crystal
morphology is an importance aspect for both research and industries
applications as physical properties of many crystals are implicitly
dependent on their shapes.52,53 Thus, an attempt was
made to understand the crystal growth of compounds 6–9. Microscopy observation of the crystal morphologies of 6–9 was carried out by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) (Figure S11a–d). The calculated crystal
morphology of 6–9 was obtained from the Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker
(BFDH) calculation method54 using their
crystal structures (Figure S11e–h). All the theoretical calculations were performed using Materials
Studio 4.0.55 Morphologies based on BFDH
calculations were compared with the experimental data obtained from
solution growth, showing a good correlation. Combining the calculated
morphology and the crystal structure, assignment of the surface chemistry
were proposed for the largest facets of crystals of 6–9 (Figure S11i–l). In the case of (6, 7), and 9, the facets (400) and (002), respectively, expose the −NH2 of DAT groups on the surface at the molecular level. For
crystal of 8, the surface of facet (100) is composed
of nitrate groups pointing outside. These results indicate that hydrogen
bond interactions play a critical role in the crystal morphology of 6–9.

Conclusions
This work demonstrates
how a large range of ordered materials can be prepared using the metallotectonic
approach that exploits the use of coordination bonds to metal ions
as a primary directing force assisted by other strong intermolecular
interactions such as hydrogen bonds. An obvious advantage of building
crystalline materials from metallotectons is that they allow (i) to
decrease the number of synthetic steps and (ii) to quickly obtain
molecular topologies and properties not otherwise available in pure
organic chemistry.

We have successfully prepared a series of
crystalline materials by coordination of 2 with Co(II),
Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II). All compounds 6–9 were
obtained in high yields as single-phase materials, as determined by
XRD, PXRD, EA, and SEM. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction investigations
of the synthesized compounds revealed that the supramolecular networks
are mainly directed by coordination and hydrogen bonds as well as
by van der Waals forces. Their physical properties were characterized
by UV–vis, IR, TGA, and DSC. The solid-state UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy spectra of 6–9 concord with their d–d transitions. All samples exhibit high
stability under thermal conditions, as determined by TGA. The IR spectra
of 6 and 7 are nearly identical, which is
in agreement with the crystallographic data.

The external morphologies
and crystal facets of 6–9 were measured
by SEM and predicted by theoretical calculations using the BFDH method.
Comparisons of experimental and calculated morphologies were in agreement,
supporting the effectiveness of the BFDH method. Furthermore, the
surface chemistry of crystals of 6–9 was proposed using a combination data including SEM measurement,
morphology prediction, and XRD.

Our study demonstrates that
properties of ordered materials can be tuned using the metallotectonic
approach. The results show that the investigated approach allowed
creating materials with different properties while preserving identical
supramolecular architectures as exemplified with compounds 6 and 7.

Experimental Section
General Notes and Procedures
for the Synthesis of 6–9
6-(Pyridin-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine 2 was synthesized by known reported methods.44 Their complexes with Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, respectively,
were prepared by the experimental procedure described below. Other
chemicals were commercially available and purchased and used without
any additional purification. Solid of 2 (2.0 equiv) was
added in small portions at 25 °C to the stirred solutions of
M(NO3)2·xH2O (1 equiv) in MeOH (25 mL). The mixtures were refluxed for 12 h
and the resulting homogeneous solutions were cooled to room temperature
and subject to crystallization by slow diffusion with diethyl ether.

Instrumentation
Crystallographic data were collected using
a Bruker Venture Metaljet diffractometer with Ga Kα radiation
and a Bruker APEX2 diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation
from a microfocus source. The structures were solved by direct methods
using SHELXT,56 and nonhydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically with least-squares minimization.57 Hydrogen atoms were treated by first locating
them from different Fourier maps, recalculating their positions using
standard values for distances and angles, and then refining them as
riding atoms. Microcrystalline powders were analyzed in transmission-mode
geometry using a Bruker D8-Discover instrument (θ–θ
geometry) equipped with a XYZ platform and a HI-STAR
gas detector. X-rays were generated using a conventional sealed-tube
source with a copper anode producing Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54178 Å). The samples were gently ground and then mounted
on a flat Kapton sample holder. The data collection involved acquisition
of two different sections with increasing angular position, giving
two different 2D frames. These frames were integrated and combined
to produce the final one-dimensional powder X-ray diffraction pattern.
Calculated powder X-ray diffraction patterns were generated from the
structural data in the corresponding CIF resulting from single-crystal
analyses. The calculation was performed using MERCURY58 software of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center.
A unique value of the full width at half maximum for the diffraction
peaks was adjusted to get a better match between the resolution of
the experimental and the calculated patterns. The determination of
the total carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur (C, H, N, and S)
contents in the compounds was performed using a EA 1108 Fisons CHNS
Element analyzer by quantitative “dynamic flash combustion”
method. The solid-state UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Cary
5000 spectrometer. The crystals are gently ground and placed on quartz
holders. The ATR–FTIR spectra were collected with a Nicolet
iS 10 Smart FT-IR Spectrometer within 600–4000 cm–1. The thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry
were performed simultaneously using a simultaneous thermal analysis
(STA) System Setaram, model Labsys Evo STA. The samples were loaded
in Al2O3 pans and isochronically heated from
35 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The scanning
electron microscopy was performed using a Hitachi SU1510 microscope.
