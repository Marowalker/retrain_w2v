A simple,
sensitive, and nonenzymatic nanospectrophotometric method
was developed for the determination of reducing sugars. The silver
mirror reaction-assisted method is based on the in situ formation
of silver nanoparticles in the presence of reducing sugars. All simple
reducing sugars (glucose, galactose, fructose, mannose, maltose, and
lactose) examined had perfectly linear regression equations. The detection
limit for glucose was 40 nM. The proposed method could be selectively
applied to various synthetic mixtures of reducing sugars with polyphenolic
compounds, and to honey, milk, and commercial fruit juice as real
samples using solid phase extraction as a clean-up process. The developed
method was also statistically validated against conventional alkaline
CUPRAC (cupric–neocuproine, Cu(II)–Nc) spectrophotometric
method using Student’s t- and F-tests.

Introduction
Carbohydrates are important
macronutrients that serve as a basic
energy source in human nutrition as well as specific functions in
vital phenomena.1 A few examples can be
listed as ribose and deoxyribose in the structure of nucleic acids,
galactose in some oils, and lactose in milk. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy
aldehydes and ketones and are classified under 4 headings as monosaccharides
(simple sugars), disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Generally, free-form monosaccharides and disaccharides are called
sugars and can be classified as reducing and nonreducing sugars according
to their chemical reactions.2 Sugars are
indicators of certain food characteristics, such as taste, flavor,
and naturalness.3 Reducing sugars are not
only related to food; it is an indispensable part of biological samples
such as blood, serum, plasma, and tissue. The sugar content of certain
foods and drinks is controlled by European legislation.4 As sugars are known to play a vital role in the
progression of major health problems (e.g., obesity) and diabetes
disease, their total or single (especially glucose) identification
is an analytical challenge. Sugar quantification is necessary in a
variety of complex biological (e.g., blood and other biological fluids),
food, and beverage matrices. Sugar-sweetened soft drinks, constituting
the largest single source of calorie-rich U.S. diet and increasing
the risk of obesity, require special investigation and monitoring.5

Reducing sugars (RSs) are usually determined
by the Fehling method6 requiring many analytical
steps (including precipitation
and titration), but different approaches for total sugar determination,
based on capillary electrophoresis,7 spectroscopic8 and chromatographic9 techniques, have been proposed. Several methods devised for the
determination of sugars generally exploit the reducing properties
of these carbohydrates, i.e., utilize the oxidation of reductive sugars
with appropriate reagents. One of the oldest and most common of these
is the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method.10

The reducing properties of monosaccharides and disaccharides,
as
environmentally friendly materials, have also allowed the synthesis
of nanoparticles, and there are numerous metal nanoparticle synthesis
methods in the literature related to this advantage. The most commonly
used of these is silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized with the
aid of reducing sugars. In particular, glucose has been used for many
years as a reducing agent for electroless deposition of silver mirrors
in the Tollens’ process.11,12 One of them is the
preparation of a stable aqueous dispersion of silver nanoparticles
during the Tollens’ process developed by Yin et al.13 The Tollens’ process for the preparation
of AgNPs with a relatively narrow size distribution may potentially
be such an advantageous process for Ag(I)-reductive assays carried
out in alkaline media (such as the proposed sugar assay) that the
as-synthesized aqueous dispersions of AgNPs remained stable for at
least 1 year13 without requiring any extra
stabilizing agent. Thus, different synthetic procedures aiming at
the production of silver nanoparticles of various shapes and sizes
were developed using reducing sugars.11,14 Tollens’
process has not only been used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles
but also applied to the development of certain colorimetric assays
of different analytes utilizing the formation of AgNPs. For gallic
acid (GA) determination, Wang et al. proposed an assay based on in
situ formation of AgNPs using a modified Tollens’ process.15 Li et al. developed a new colorimetric assay
for the determination of o-phenylenediamine (OPD)
using Tollens’ reagent.16 These
assays (for GA and OPD) relied on the reduction of Ag+ by
the related analyte in the presence of NaOH and aqueous NH3, resulting in a color change from colorless to yellow, which could
be detected by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption
with the use of an UV–vis spectrophotometer or even naked eye.
Recently, Chaiendoo et al. have proposed a colorimetric sensor based
on Tollens’ reagent modified-silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) templated
by poly(methacrylic acid) for the determination of formaldehyde.17

A colorimetric method based on metal nanoparticle
formation for
the determination of sugar was proposed by Palazzo et al.,18 in which gold nanoparticle synthesis was performed
in changing glucose concentrations. The authors claimed that their
colorimetric method could determine all reducing sugars (including
sucrose), where the limit of detection was 10 μm for glucose,18 but the useful analytical range of this “pink
assay” was rather narrow with a nonlinear response. Particle
aggregation could only be prevented with the addition of the CTAB
surfactant, and the whole assay was rather lengthy (90 min). On the
other hand, silver has the highest plasmon excitation efficiency,
and at the same time, it offers a distinct advantage for colorimetric
sensors as the only material capable of producing SPR absorption in
the entire visible spectrum (400–1000 nm).19 Owing to these advantages, AgNPs have been synthesized
in different shapes and sizes under varying conditions using different
reducing agents (citrate, borohydride, ascorbic acid, plant extracts,
etc.) and are still used as colorimetric sensors for various analytes.
Another option for the successful production of AgNPs is the use of
saccharide reductants which are cheap and favorable aldehydes. Thus,
it was the aim of this work to combine the economic and environmentally
friendly nature of AgNP synthesis using saccharides with the determination
of reducing sugars in a simple and practical nanocalorimetric assay.
As reducing sugars could be best oxidized with Ag(I) in the alkaline
region, we thought that the best way to accomplish this aim was to
use the Tollens’ procedure (i.e., reducing Ag+ from
a diamminesilver(I) complex) so as to control the nanoparticle size
such that analytical wavelength selection could be easily made without
red-shifts of LSPR maxima. We were able to reduce Ag(NH3)2+ with reducing sugars (i.e., glucose, fructose,
galactose, mannose, maltose, and lactose) to zero-valent silver nanoparticles
(Ag0NPs) under special conditions, and thus devise a direct
spectrophotometric method for reducing sugar quantification in food
extracts by measuring the 410 nm absorbance pertaining to the LSPR
band of nanoparticle solution having a yellow color. This method was
both very sensitive (at nM levels) and exhibited excellent linearity
of absorbance versus sugar concentration.

Results and Discussion
Optimization
Parameters of the Developed Method
The
developed method was optimized considering several important parameters
such as the amount of NaOH, reaction time, temperature, and molar
ratio of AgNO3 and NH3. Glucose was chosen as
the representative reducing sugar for optimization studies.

First, experiments were performed with 0.1 M NaOH in the volume range
of 0.1–0.5 mL for choosing the optimal amount of NaOH. Although
low amounts (0.3 and 0.2 mL) of NaOH were ideal for high concentrations
of glucose, this amount was not sufficient for low concentrations
of glucose solutions. Likewise, in a similar study, Balavandy et al.
had observed that the increased ratio of NaOH-to-alginate led to a
blue shift of the LSPR peak of nanoparticles to a lower wavelength
in parallel to a decrease in the particle size of AgNPs.20 Therefore, the appropriate amount of NaOH was
determined as 0.4 mL for low and high concentrations of glucose. The
optimal amount of NaOH was determined as 8.0 × 10–3 M (in final conc.), obtained using 0.4 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution
in a final volume of 5 mL.

For choosing the optimal reaction
temperature, experiments were
performed in the presence of 0.1 M NaOH at 25, 30, 45, 60, 65, and
70 °C. No results were obtained at low temperatures, and the
ideal results (maximum absorbance) were obtained at temperatures over
60 °C. Both the low (2.0 × 10–6 M) and
high (1.0 × 10–5 M as initial conc.) concentrations
of glucose were studied, and the optimal reaction temperature was
chosen as 70 °C for both concentration values.

For choosing
the optimal reaction time, experiments were performed
between 0 and 15 min. The developed method was applied to glucose
samples at both low (2.0 × 10–6 M) and high
(1.0 × 10–5 M) concentrations, and the obtained
results were compared. The optimal reaction time for both the concentration
values was obtained as 6 min, beyond which the results did not change.

Experiments were carried out in the presence of 0.1 M NaOH for
choosing the molar ratio of AgNO3-to-NH3. The
final volume was 5 mL, the amount of 2.0 × 10–3 M AgNO3 was reduced when the amount of 1.0 × 10–2 M NH3 was increased. Both low (2.0 ×
10–6 M) and high (1.0 × 10–5 M) concentrations of glucose were studied. Optimal amounts of 2.0
× 10–3 M AgNO3 and 1.0 × 10–2 M NH3 were selected to be 0.6 and 2 mL,
respectively.

Initial concentrations of AgNO3 and
NH3 were
determined according to the amount of free ammonia present in the
medium, considering the Ag(I)–ammine complex formation (i.e.,
species distribution) diagram (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Formation curve of Ag(I)–ammine complexes (the
species distribution
curve drawn by one of the authors “Selen Durmazel” using
the corresponding stability constants).

Ag+ ion combines with NH3 in a two-step
reaction.
It first picks up one NH3 molecule to form a one-coordinate
complex (eq 1). 1  This intermediate complex then picks
up a
second NH3 molecule in a separate step. 2  Essentially, all of the silver is present
as the Ag+ ion at very low concentrations of NH3. As the NH3 concentration increases, the dominant species
soon becomes the two-coordinate Ag(NH3)2+ ion, with only a minor contribution of the 1:1 complex within
the whole range (eq 2). Even at NH3 concentrations as small as 10–3 M, most of the silver is present as the Ag(NH3)2+ ion (Figure 1), because the logarithm of the cumulative stability constant
of the 1:2 silver–ammine complex is log β2 = 7.0 at 15 °C.21 Under our
experimental conditions of the excess NH3 ligand, it was
clear that essentially all the silver(I) was bound to the two-coordinate
Ag(NH3)2+ complex ion. This would
reduce the standard redox potential of the Ag+/Ag couple
by (RT/nF) log β2 = 0.0592 × 7 = 0.42 V, enabling the formation of controlled-size
silver nanoparticles.

During the preparation of the Tollens’
reagent, excess ammonia
should be avoided rendering the test much less sensitive. Otherwise,
the formation of addition products between ammonia and aldehydes would
reduce the amount of free aldehyde available for the reaction with
ammoniacal silver nitrate. A similar reduction might also take place
if a too high concentration of alkali was used. When alkalinity and
oxidative conditions were excessive, Yin et al.13 observed that the LSPR peaks red-shifted (with a significant
reduction in the corresponding band intensities) possibly resulting
from the formation of an ultrathin layer of silver oxide (Ag2O) on the surface of preformed AgNPs. Under strongly alkaline conditions,
aldehydes may also undergo the side reactions of aldol condensation
and Cannizzaro reaction. To minimize these undesired side reactions,
Tollens’ reagent should be prepared with care, ensuring that
ammonia was not in great excess and pH was not excessively high.22

Possible Mechanism of the Proposed Method
Although
Tollens’ test, carried out in a Ag+–NH3 system, has been used for over hundred years for detecting
aldehydes by the silver mirror reaction, the test becomes more sensitive
by initially adding a few drops of NaOH.22 The sensitivity of the test was reported to increase with increasing
pH and temperature, where free alkali (OH–) was
supposed to act as an accelerator at pH > 10. 3   4  Oxidation of an aldehyde to carboxylic acid
involves the transfer of two electrons, and requires two silver(I)
ions through a free radical intermediate, with the following mechanism 5   6   7   8  The Ag+ ion as a reactant of eq 5 may be in the form of
an aqua-ion or an amine-complex.22 When
Tollens’ reaction is used in the reduction of silver(I) salts
by reducing sugars to metallic Ag, three reaction steps should be
taken into account:11(1) Precipitation of silver oxide (Ag2O): 9  

(2) Dissolution of Ag2O by
forming diamminesilver(I) complex: 10  

(3) Reduction of diamminesilver(I) complex
by RS to Ag0: 11  

A blue-shift
(to shorter wavelengths) is usually observed in
the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption maxima of spherical
AgNPs accompanying a decrease in particle size, due to repulsive effects
on nanoparticles.23 Dubas and Pimpan made
a green synthesis of AgNPs that they used for NH3 sensing,
and observed a blue-shift in the localized SPR wavelength of nanoparticles
accompanying a color change from purple to yellow; the authors attributed
this blue-shift (in NH3-containing solution) to the repulsive
effect of Ag(NH3)2+ ions adsorbed
on nanoparticles as well as to the increase in water content of the
nanoparticle environment, resulting in more hydrophilic and isolated
particles with a shorter wavelength-shifted spectrum.24 Likewise, Amirjani and Fatmehsari were able to reduce the
number of free AgNPs by the polyol method of nanoparticle synthesis
and used them for ammonia sensing; the localized SPR band of homogeneous
AgNPs in NH3-containing solution was distinctively blue-shifted
at around 400 nm.25 In our case, since
AgNPs were generated in an ammonia solution, the stable Ag(NH3)2+ cationic complex adsorbed on AgNPs
is responsible from this repulsive effect on nanoparticles, causing
the blue-shift to 410 nm.24 The AgNPs formed
as a result of the redox reaction between RS (i.e., representative
compound: glucose) and Ag(NH3)2+ were
characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the TEM images
of AgNPs obtained from {Ag(I) + glucose} in the absence and presence
of aqueous NH3 are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively, where silver nanoparticles
did not exhibit a uniform particle size distribution in the absence
of ammonia, whereas with NH3, approximately 10 nm-sized
spherical nanoparticles were produced.

Figure 2 TEM images of the AgNPs
formed from the redox reaction between
7.2 × 10–6 M (final conc.) glucose and Ag(NH3)2+ in the absence (a) and presence
(b) of NH3 under special conditions (in alkaline medium
and 70 °C water bath for 6 min).

Another important factor in the formation of uniform AgNPs
is the
rather small potential difference constituting the major driving force
of Ag(NH3)2+ oxidation of glucose.
The presence of ammonia entraps Ag+ ions in a relatively
stable complex of Ag(NH3)2+, and
as a result, the Ag+/Ag standard redox potential decreases
from +0.80 V pertaining to uncomplexed silver ion to +0.38 V characteristic
of Ag(NH3)2+. On the other hand,
the gluconate/glucose redox potential in acid solution is 0.056 V
vs standard hydrogen electrode,26 but decreases
with increasing pH in ammonia solution. If silver(I) ion is employed
without ammonia, the silver ion is reduced so rapidly that oversaturation
would lead to the formation of colloidal silver in a black and cloudy
suspension.27 Silver(I)–ammonia
complexation reduces the redox potential gap between the Ag(I) oxidant
and sugar reductant (i.e., about −0.15 V at pH 7, depending
on the type of sugar) also giving rise to a slower reaction28 thereby preventing oversaturation (which would
otherwise generate a large number of nuclei growing to highly variable
particle sizes) and enabling uniform-sized AgNP deposition at a definite
redox potential controlled by stable complex formation.

from the reduction of Ag(NH3)2+ by
RS in alkaline medium), using varying concentrations of glucose in
the μM range, are shown in Figure 3. The absence of a shift in LSPR band maxima
as a function of glucose concentration was indicative of the absence
of oversaturation, yielding uniform-sized AgNPs, as controlled by
careful adjustment of the ammonia concentration.

The equations emerging
from linear regression analysis, with the
corresponding correlation coefficients, were found by applying the
proposed and reference methods to select reducing sugar samples, as
tabulated in Table 2. Evaluating the data in Table 2, it was obvious that the developed method yielded
about one order-of-magnitude higher slopes for the regression equations
(i.e., indicating higher sensitivity of determination) than the alkaline
CUPRAC assay for tested sugars.

and lactose.

c Linear ranges
(in final conc.) were
6.0 × 10–6 to 3.0 × 10–5 mol L–1 for all sugar standards.

Taking advantage of the enhanced
sensitivity of localized SPR absorption
of silver nanoparticles produced from the Tollens reagent by glucose,
our detection limit was 40 nM with a fixed analytical wavelength and
linear calibration, whereas glucose oxidase (GlOx)-based enzymatic
assays of glucose via H2O2 detection remained
within the mM−μM range. A few examples of GlOx-based
assays for glucose detection are the CdSe/ZnS quantum dots fluorescence
method of Gill et al.,29 the carbon nanotube
voltammetric system of Wooten et al.,30 and the AgNP dissolution colorimetric method by H2O2 of Gao et al.,31 which all had
milli-to-micromolar sensitivities for glucose.

Statistical comparison
between the proposed and the reference methods
applied to glucose standards and milk samples was made on 7 and 5
repetitive analyses, respectively. Sugar contents of these samples
were found with the aid of calibration curves for glucose. The results
of Student’s t-test and F-test are shown in Table S-1, basically
exhibiting no significant difference (at 95% confidence level) between
the accuracies and precisions of the two methods.

Hydrolysis
of Sucrose
Various saccharides were used
to prepare silver nanoparticles.32,33 The most widely
used of these compounds were monosaccharides, among which glucose
was preferred, although substantially all monosaccharides had reducing
properties. Some studies were also published regarding the use of
disaccharides such as maltose (formed by two glucose molecules) and
lactose (formed by a glucose and galactose molecule) as reducing agents.28,34

In the tested real samples, the sugars present were basically
glucose, fructose, and sucrose for fruit juices,35 lactose for milk, and sucrose, glucose, and fructose for
honey.36 Lactose, containing a hemiacetal
group, is already a reducing sugar, thereby not requiring any preliminary
hydrolysis.37

The disaccharide saccharose
(or sucrose) is a nonreducing sugar
which can be hydrolyzed with acids or enzymes. Since hydrolysis of
each molecule of sucrose yields one molecule glucose and one molecule
fructose,8 the indirect determination of
sucrose becomes possible. According to literature reports, acidic
hydrolysis of sucrose is generally carried out with hydrochloric acid.
However, in the presence of Cl– ion, the precipitation
equilibrium of AgCl(s) becomes dominant and the formation
of AgCl(s) colloids was observed. Therefore, sucrose hydrolysis
was carried out with dilute sulfuric acid.38 The solubility product of AgCl is at the order of 10–10, whereas that of Ag2SO4 at 10–5. Therefore, the possibility of Ag2SO4 formation
does not pose a risk. Besides, in the ammonia-containing medium of
AgNP formation, log β2 for the Ag(NH3)2+ complex is 7.0, obviously suppressing Ag2SO4 precipitation. The outcome of acidic hydrolysis
was investigated with the application of the proposed and reference
methods to the hydrolysate together with the possible hydrolysis products
of (glucose + fructose) in a mixture. Sugar contents (expressed as
glucose equivalents) of sucrose hydrolysate and of a synthetic mixture
consisting of (glucose + fructose) are given in Table 3. These findings confirm that the developed
method can be accurately applied to total reducing sugar determination
in complex samples having sucrose hydrolysate or equivalent components
(Table 3).

corresponding to 180.2 and 360.3 mg glucose equivalent per liter,
respectively (N = 3).

b Synthetic mixtures were prepared
as theoretically equivalent to the hydrolysis products of sucrose.

Analysis of Synthetic Mixtures
and Real Samples
To
evaluate the interference effects arising from polyphenolic compounds
expected to be present in real samples (fruit juices, honey etc.),
suitable synthetic mixtures were prepared and solid phase extraction
(SPE) was applied to the polyphenolic-containing samples, at the end
of which recovery values were calculated. SPE is an increasingly useful
sample preparation technique, the products of which are widely used
for sample extraction, concentration, and clean-up.39 SPE with a C18 stationary phase has been demonstrated to
be appropriate for the separation of sugars from phenolic compounds
in complex samples.40 In this regard, the
developed method was applied two times to the synthetic mixtures before
and after SPE separation (the steps of which are depicted in Figure S-1) to see the reagent color stemming
from (sugars + phenolic interferents) versus sugars alone. The expected
versus found results (reported as milligram glucose equivalent per
liter of sample) and errors of recoveries are depicted in Table S-2. The synthetic mixtures (1–3)
would produce positive errors before SPE separation due to the interfering
effect of polyphenols to the proposed method. However, the recoveries
recorded after SPE (i.e., ranging between 95.2 and 104.2%) demonstrated
that reducing sugars could be totally separated from common phenolics
and precisely estimated in synthetic samples (Table S-2). Experimental results (unreported) also demonstrated
that polyphenolics could be efficiently separated from sugars and
be determined following elution from the two SPE cartridges using
80% aqueous methanol as the eluting solvent.

In choosing real
samples, polyphenol-rich samples, were preferred to see their possible
interference to reducing sugar assays. With sequential use of two
distinct SPE cartridges (C18 and polyamide), phenolic interference
was successfully eliminated. The results (as grams glucose equivalent
per 100 mL or 100 g) versus declared amounts are depicted in Table S-3. In honey samples, the findings of
both methods were lower than the declared amounts. In spite of the
additional hydrolysis procedure applied, a significant change in the
reported sugar content of honey was not noticeable. Data in Table S-3 show 7–14% variations between
the declared and found contents of certain real samples such as milk,
apricot-apple juice, and honey; however, it should be considered that
the actual sugar contents of these samples were not declared on their
packing labels, bringing some uncertainty to the sugar content of
commercial samples.

Conclusions
Since the concentration
of reducing sugars is controlled by European
legislation for certain foods and beverages, it is important to develop
simple, inexpensive, and sensitive methods for the determination of
these sugars in food samples. In the literature, there are reducing
sugar determination methods based on metal nanoparticle formation,
but these methods either do not provide a linear calibration or do
not yield sufficient sensitivity. For example, methods based on gold
nanoparticle formation provided such a large redox potential gap between
the oxidant and reductant that it was extremely difficult to control
the resulting nanoparticle size.18 Therefore,
this study aims to develop a spectrophotometric method based on the
controlled formation of nanoparticles with reducing sugars. The principle
of the method relies on the formation of silver nanoparticles by the
reduction of the Ag+ ion in the presence of aqueous ammonia
and sodium hydroxide to zero-valent silver (Ag0) by reducing
sugars. Although there are a number of nanoparticle-based determination
methods for reducing sugars in the literature, it is not possible
to adjust the particle size and distribution in alkaline solution
necessarily used for sugar oxidation, which could only be made feasible
by the Tollens reaction incorporating ammonia for alkalinity. Thus,
a single analytical wavelength with excellent linearity of response
was achieved. The limit of detection of the developed method was at
the nM level, and both the linear correlation coefficient (r = 0.9999) of the calibration study and the molar absorption
coefficient (ε = 1.5 × 105 L mol–1 cm–1) were satisfactory for glucose as the representative
compound. The method has also been validated against the alkaline
CUPRAC method as the reference method of reducing sugar determination
established in the literature. The recommended method is simple and
cost-effective, which can conveniently be applied even in traditional
laboratories because of the easy accessibility and low cost of the
reagents used. It is believed that this work may open the way to innovative
studies employing nanotechnology in sensitive and linear-response
sensing of reducing sugars. The LOD values for commercial test strips
and electrochemical micropaper-based analytical devices range around
15 and 26 mg dL–1 (about 1 mM), respectively, whereas
the medically relevant glucose concentrations lie between 70 and 120
mg dL–1.41 Hamedi et
al. fabricated a microfluidics paper device to measure glucose between
2.7 and 22.2 mM.42 Compared to the accuracy
level (≥100 mg dL–1, approx. 5.5 mM) of commercial
blood sugar detectors used as medical devices, the developed method
is much superior in terms of sensitivity by allowing the measurement
of glucose in the nM range. Designing novel approaches to estimate
low concentrations of glucose continues to attract attention, because
it has potential use in several areas, such as food industry, clinical
chemistry (such as tear fluid),43 and diabetic
diet monitoring. The quantification of glucose at very low concentrations
in intra- and extra-cellular fluid may be of potential interest in
bacteriology as a part of improving fermentation technology after
extended periods of incubation.44

Experimental
Section
Materials and Chemicals

sucrose, d-(+)-glucose, d-(−)-fructose, d-(+)-galactose, d-(+)-mannose, d-(+)-maltose
monohydrate, d-(+)-lactose monohydrate, (+)-catechin hydrate,
(−)-epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid monohydrate, l-(+)-ascorbic acid, and potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate,
Discovery DPA-6S (250 mg, 3 mL), and Discovery DSC-18 (1 g, 6 mL)
SPE cartridges were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
Copper(II) chloride dihydrate, ammonia solution (NH3),
sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hexacyanoferrate(II)
trihydrate, and zinc sulfate heptahydrate were obtained from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany). Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
was obtained from Carlo Erba (Italy).

Instruments
The
spectra and absorption measurements
were recorded in matched Hellma Suprasil black quartz cuvettes (optical
thickness: 10 mm) using a Shimadzu UV-1800 ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). Incubation
of the reducing sugar-containing standard and/or samples was performed
using the Wisd WiseBath water bath for both the proposed method and
reference alkaline CUPRAC method. Agilent Vac Elut 12 position manifold
(California) and Isolab vacuum pump (Istanbul, Turkey) were used for
solid phase extraction (SPE) processes. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) measurements of nanoparticles were performed using a QImaging
Retiga 4000R.

Preparation of the Solutions
All
glassware and plastic
materials used throughout the work were cleaned with freshly prepared
aqua regia (HCl/HNO3, 3:1, v/v), rinsed with distilled
water, and dried in air prior to use. All concentrations given under
experimental conditions were the initial values unless otherwise stated.

The proposed method solutions: all solutions used throughout were
prepared daily, except for NaOH. A Stock solution of AgNO3, aqueous NH3, and NaOH were prepared at 2.0 × 10–3, 1.0 × 10–2, and 0.1 M concentrations,
respectively, in ultrapure water.

Alkaline CUPRAC method solutions:
CuCl2 solution (1.0
× 10–2 M), alkaline solution as 0.5 M NaOH
containing 2% (w/v) Na2CO3, and 0.1 M sodium
potassium tartrate were prepared in ultrapure water. Neocuproine (Nc)
solution (1.5 × 10–2 M) was prepared daily
in absolute ethanol.

Stock solutions of the related reducing
sugars and phenolic compounds
(for investigation of interference effects) were prepared at 1.0 ×
10–3 M concentration in ultrapure water, and the
working solutions of these analytes were prepared by diluting from
their stock solutions with ultrapure water. The concentration ranges
of the working solutions of related RS were as follows; 2.4 ×
10–6 to 1.8 × 10–5 M for
glucose, 2.4 × 10–6 to 2.4 × 10–5 M for fructose, 1.5 × 10–6 to 1.2 ×
10–5 M for galactose, 3.0 × 10–6 to 2.4 × 10–5 M for mannose, 3.0 × 10–6 to 1.5 × 10–5 for maltose,
and 3.0 × 10–6 to 1.5 × 10–5 M for lactose.

Recommended Procedure for RS Determination
To obtain
the reaction mixture, 0.6 mL of 2.0 × 10–3 M
AgNO3 solution, 0.4 mL of 0.1 M NaOH (wait for approx.
30 s for Ag2O formation), and 2 mL of 1.0 × 10–2 M aqueous NH3 were added to a test tube,
respectively. Then, 2 mL of (x) M RS standard or
sample solution was introduced into the test tube, and the reaction
mixture was incubated for 6 min in a thermostated water bath at 70
°C. At the end of this time, the test tube was cooled in an ice
bath, and pale yellow sol formation, the absorbance of which was directly
proportional to the increase in concentration, was observed. The absorbance
at 410 nm was recorded against a blank solution excluding RS using
a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Figure 4).

determination
of reducing sugars in food extracts. (Inset photograph was taken by
one of the authors Selen Durmazel).

Reference Alkaline CUPRAC Spectrophotometric Method
The
total reducing sugar content was evaluated by the conventional
alkaline Cu(II)–Nc spectrophotometric method as described by
Başkan et al.8 One milliliter of
1.0 × 10–2 M CuCl2, 1 mL of 1.5
× 10–2 M Nc, x mL of sample,
(1 – x) mL of distilled water, 1 mL of 0.5
M NaOH containing 2% (w/v) NaCO3, and 1 mL of 0.1 M sodium
potassium tartrate solution were added to a test tube in this order.
The mixture in the stoppered tube was incubated for 20 min in a thermostated
water bath at 60 °C. The tubes were cooled to room temperature,
and their absorbance values at 450 nm were measured against a blank
solution excluding RS using a UV/vis spectrophotometer.

Preparation
of Real Samples and Synthetic Mixtures
The commercial fruit
juice, honey, and UHT whole milk samples were
supplied from a local market of Istanbul. The honey sample was prepared
by weighing 1.0 g of honey, made homogeneous by a certain amount of
distilled water and diluted to 100 mL with H2O. The milk
sample extraction procedure was carried out as described by Kumar
et al.45 Briefly, 5 mL of milk sample was
taken in a 14 mL centrifuge tube. 0.5 mL of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II)
trihydrate (3.6% aq.) solution was introduced into the sample and
vortexed for 1 min. Then, 0.75 mL of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (7.2%
aq.) solution was added and vortexed for 1 min. The mixture was centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 5 min.45 Two milliliters
of the supernatant was filtered through the GF/PET microfilter, adjusted
to pH 7 with 0.1 M NaOH and diluted to 250 mL with ultrapure water.
The commercial fruit juice sample was prepared by filtration through
the glass fiber/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (GF/PET) microfilter
and 1 mL of the filtrate was diluted to 50 or 100 mL with distilled
water.

Standard mixtures (1–3) were prepared of with
the use of standard solutions of reducing sugars and certain phenolics,
the selection of which was performed according to their occurrence
in natural samples such as fruit juice and milk. Besides, these sugar
mixtures were prepared in the absence of phenolics, enabling the comparison
of their alkaline CUPRAC recoveries. The final concentrations of synthetic
mixture constituents are indicated below:(1) 1.50 × 10–4 M glucose, catechin, and chlorogenic acid, separately.

(2) 1.67 × 10–5 M glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, catechin, and
chlorogenic acid, separately.

(3) 1.50 × 10–5 M glucose, fructose, galactose,
maltose, lactose, ascorbic acid,
gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, and chlorogenic acid, separately.



Hydrolysis of Sucrose
The hydrolysis
process was carried
out using dilute sulfuric acid as described by Bower et al.38 Twenty-five milliliters of sucrose stock solutions
(0.5 × 10–3 and 1.0 × 10–3 M) containing 0.1% (w/w) H2SO4 were introduced
into a 100 mL-conical flask. The mixture was stirred vigorously in
a silicon oil bath at 160 °C for 3 min. After 3 min, the flask
was removed from the bath and the solution was allowed to cool at
room temperature. Then, the hydrolysate was neutralized with 0.1 M
NaOH and diluted with ultrapure water before applying the proposed
and reference methods.

Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) for Sample Clean-Up
C18
and polyamide SPE cartridges were used to eliminate phenolic compounds
and other possible interferents of fruit juices and honey samples
to clean up sugars. The stages of the clean-up process were described
in the Supporting Information (SI) (Figure S-1).

Statistical Analysis
All assays were carried out in
triplicate for each sample and standard. Descriptive statistical analyses
were performed using Excel software (Microsoft Office 2013) for calculating
the mean and the standard error of the mean. The precision and accuracy
of two methods (the developed and reference method) were compared
by the F-test and Student’s t-test.
