Introduction
Sulfones and their derivatives
belong to an important type of organic compounds,1 as well as key functional units found in variety of pharmaceuticals,
materials, and natural products. Furthermore, they are also very useful
building blocks in organic transformations.2 At the same time, the introduction of additional groups, such as
amino, keto, hydroxyl, and alkoxyl, along with sulfonyl group into
a molecule usually leads to compounds bearing good bioactivities.3 Therefore, development of the related efficient
synthetic methodologies has gained many interests in this research
area.4 Among them, difunctionalization
of alkenes turned out to be an efficient synthetic strategy, as an
additional functional group along with sulfonyl group could be introduced
at the same time in one reaction.5 However,
the traditional difunctionalizaton reactions usually needed chemical
oxidants, transition-metal catalysts and even additives. Thus, the
development of green difunctionalizaton reactions becomes very urgent.

Currently, electrochemical difunctionalization6 of alkenes has become one of the hottest research areas
in organic synthetic chemistry. It has been proved to be a powerful
and green tool for the construction of complex organic compounds,
as no chemical oxidant is needed, thus avoiding generation of reagent
wastes and use of harsh reaction conditions.7 All these promising features result in many unprecedented developments
on the difunctionalization of the C–C unsaturated bond to be
possible for the synthesis of polyfunctionalized molecules in a very
simple manner. In the past years, Moeller,8 Ackermann,9 Lei,10 Lin,11 Xu,12 and other groups13 have independently
reported their elegant works in this area, such as electrochemical
difunctionalization of alkenes, intermolecular annulation, and intramolecular
cyclization. Recently, Lei’s group reported an electrochemical
oxidative difunctionalization of alkenes for the synthesis of β-alkoxy
sulfones with sulfonyl hydrazides as the sulfonyl sources.14 Very recently, the Sun group developed sulfinic
acids as sulfonyl precursors for the electrochemical alkoxysulfonylation
reaction of alkenes.15 However, only two
examples were presented in this reaction with moderate chemical yields.
Considering sodium sulfinate16 as an available,
easy-to-handle and stable sulfonyl source compared with sulfonyl azide,
sulfonyl hydrazide, sulfonyl cyanide, sulfonyl halide, and sulfinic
acid,16,17 we envision that sodium sulfinate can be
used as the substrate for the synthesis of β-alkoxy sulfones
via electrochemical difunctionalization reaction. Thus, we herein
reported an electrochemical procedure to synthesize the β-alkoxy
sulfones with sodium sulfinates as sulfonyl precursors via alkoxysulfonylation
reaction with aryl alkenes and alcohols (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Electrochemical Alkoxysulfonylation of Styrenes, Sodium
Sulfinates, and Alcohols
Results
and Discussion
We carried out our initial studies on this
electrochemical difunctionalization reaction using α-methyl
styrene 1a, sodium 4-methylbenzenesulfinate 2a, and methanol as model substrates (Table 1). When the reaction was conducted in an
undivided cell at a constant current of 10 mA with a carbon anode
and a carbon plate cathode using LiClO4 as an electrolyte,
the desired alkoxysulfonylation product 3a was obtained
in 60% yield after 3 h at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere
(entry 1). The addition of 4 Å MS was essential for this system,
as a lower yield was observed when the reaction was conducted under
air without using 4 Å MS (52%, entry 2), and some α-methyl
styrene remained. To improve the reaction outcome, we tried to add
some additives into the system; the results of entries 3 and 4 indicated
that p-toluenesulfonic acid was a good choice leading
to an increased yield (77%). Variations of reaction time and electric
current showed no obvious effects on the reaction (entries 5–7);
however, prolonging the reaction time to 4.5 h at 10 mA resulted in
a slightly lower yield (entry 5). Further screening of the electrode
was carried out, which was found to show a significant influence on
the reaction (entries 10–13). Changing the carbon plate cathode
into Pt, Ni, Cu, or Fe resulted in noticeably decreased yields (31–66%).
Surprisingly, further exploration of electrolyte indicated that this
reaction could proceed smoothly and result in the highest yield without
the addition of additional electrolyte (82%, entry 15). It worth mentioning
that TsOH played a crucial role in this transformation. In the absence
of TsOH, a significant decline of yield was observed (53%, entry 16).
It is mainly because of the in situ generation of sulfinic acid,15 which makes the reduction of proton easier at
the cathode to release hydrogen gas. Changing the loading amount of
sodium 4-methylbenzenesulfinate 2a from 2.0 to 1.5 or
3.0 equiv did not provide any improvement in yield (entries 17 and
18). Finally, the control experiment was performed without electricity,
and no conversion occurred with all the starting materials remaining
(entry 19).

Under optimized reaction conditions, we turned our
attention to investigate the substrate structural generalities of
this electrochemical alkoxysulfonylation system. First, we carried
out the reactions of α-methyl styrene 1a in methanol
using varieties of sodium sulfinates, and the results are shown in Scheme 2. All the examined
arylsulfinates worked very well in this reaction, providing the target
products 3a–i in good yields (60–82%).
In particular, sodium arylsulfinates bearing strong electron-donating
(methoxyl, 3h) and strong electron-withdrawing (fluoro, 3c, e) substituents on the aromatic ring were all tolerated.
The position of the substituents on phenyl had almost no influence
on this transformation, as the ortho- and para-substituted sulfinates
provided a similar outcome (76 and 80% for 3b and 3f, respectively). The reaction of the sodium arylsulfinates
with nitro on the para-position was complex, and the corresponding
product was isolated with poor yield (16%, 3j), with
almost all the olefin starting material consumed. This is mainly because
the nitro group might change the basicity of the sulfinate and influence
its equilibrium with the TsOH present. One aliphatic sodium sulfinate 2l was also tried in this reaction; unfortunately, only a
trace of the desired 3l was observed.

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope Study
of Substituted Sodium Sulfinates,
Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol), 2 (1.0 mmol), MeOH (8 mL), TsOH (0.5 mmol), 4 Å MS (200
mg), and constant current = 10 mA, in undivided cell at room temperature
under nitrogen atmosphere for 2.5 h.

Yields.

Subsequently,
a variety of styrene derivatives were investigated under optimized
reaction conditions. The reactions of the alkenes bearing different
substituents on the aromatic ring proceeded smoothly, giving rise
to the corresponding product in 58–78% yields (Scheme 3). For example, α-methyl
styrene bearing 4-methyl, 4-methoxyl, 4-fluoro, and 3,5-dimethyl groups
on a phenyl ring worked very well to afford 4a–d in good yields. It is worth mentioning that styrene 1e was also a suitable substrate for this reaction and was converted
into the corresponding product 4e in 78% chemical yield.
Then, a series of different α-substituted styrene derivatives
were employed in this reaction for the investigation of steric hindrance
effect. Replacing the α-substituted group from methyl by ethyl
(1f) or propyl (1g), no obvious effect was
found and the desired products were obtained in the yields of 70 and
63%, respectively. Even the cyclohexyl-substituted styrene (1h) could well participate in this reaction, affording the
expected product 4h in 74% yield.

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope Study
of Substituted Styrenes,
Reaction conditions: 1 (0.5 mmol), 2a (1.0 mmol), MeOH (8 mL), TsOH
(0.5 mmol), 4 Å MS (200 mg), constant current = 10 mA, 2.5 h,
undivided cell, and at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Yields.

As the final
objective of the substrate scope study, we tried to extend methanol
to other aliphatic alcohols for this reaction (Scheme 4). Owing to the very low solubility of sodium
4-methylbenzenesulfinate 2a in these aliphatic alcohols,
water was used as a co-solvent in these reactions. We were pleased
to find that the reactions of ethanol and propanol could proceed smoothly
to afford the corresponding alkoxysulfonylation products (5a–b) in 60 and 45% yields, respectively. Unfortunately, the reaction
with isopropanol only provided 29% yield of the desired product (5c), and the competing reaction, hydroxysulfonylation, with
water as a coupling partner was observed.

Scheme 4 Substrate Scope Study of Different Alcohols,
Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol), 2a (1.0 mmol), alcohol (8 mL),
H2O (1 mL), TsOH (0.5 mmol), LiClO4 (1.5 mmol),
constant current = 10 mA, in undivided cell at room temperature under
anitrogen atmosphere for 2.5 h.

Yields.

To demonstrate the
practical application of this electrochemical difunctinalization system,
we then examined the gram-scale preparation about this electrochemical
reaction (Scheme 5).
The reaction was carried out using 5 mmol of α-methyl styrene 1a under the standard reaction conditions. The transformation
proceeded smoothly to afford the target compound 3a with
59% yield after 24 h. The result underscores that the current electrochemical
system is a practical and eco-friendly way for the synthesis of functionalized
β-alkoxysulfones.

Scheme 5 Large-Scale Synthesis
Finally, a control experiment was performed
to get an insight into the mechanism of this transformation (Scheme 6). After adding a
radical inhibitor TEMPO (3 equiv) to the reaction under optimized
reaction conditions, the reaction was totally inhibited and no desired
product 3a was obtained at all, with almost all the starting
material α-methyl styrene 1a remaining. This result
clearly indicates that a radical pathway may be involved in the electrochemical
transformation.

Scheme 6 Control
Experiment
According to the above experimental results
and the previous literature reports,13b,14,15 a plausible mechanism was proposed in Scheme 7 for the electrochemical transformation.
Initially, sodium 4-methylbenzenesulfinate 2a is oxidized
at the graphite anode to generate radical A, which easily
tautomerizes to sulfonyl radical B.13b Then, sulfonyl radical B adds to the C–C
double bond of α-methyl styrene 1a to afford the
alkyl radical C. Subsequently, anodic oxidation of radical
intermediate C generates alkyl cation D,
which undergoes a nucleophilic attack reaction by methanol to produce
intermediate E.13a Finally,
deprotonation of E provides the target product 3a, as well as the release of H2 at the cathode.

Scheme 7 Proposed Mechanism
Conclusions
In summary, we developed
an efficient electrochemical oxidative alkoxysulfonylation of aryl
alkenes with alcohols and sodium sulfinates. This environmentally
benign alkoxysulfonylation of alkenes used sodium sulfinate as a new
sulfonyl precursor and could easily afford a series of β-alkoxy
sulfones in good yields without the use of any metal catalysts or
chemical oxidants. This reaction enriches the contents of electrochemical
difunctionalization of olefins and provides a new way for the synthesis
of β-alkoxy sulfones.

Experimental
Section
Reaction of α-Methyl Styrene
with Methanol and Various Sodium Sulfinates
An undivided
cell was equipped with a graphite anode and a graphite cathode and
connected to a DC power supply. Into the cell flushed with nitrogen
were taken α-methyl styrene 1a (0.5 mmol, 59 mg),
sodium sulfinate 2 (1.0 mmol), TsOH (0.5 mmol, 86 mg),
4 Å MS (200 mg), and MeOH (8 mL). The mixture was electrolyzed
under constant current (10 mA) at room temperature for 2.5 h. Then,
the reaction was diluted with H2O (20 mL) and extracted
with EtOAc (20 mL × 3). The combined organic layers were dried
with anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated
in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography using
hexane/EtOAc (5:1, v/v) as an eluent to afford the desired product 3.

Reaction of
Styrene Derivatives with Sodium 4-Methylbenzenesulfinate and Methanol
An undivided cell was equipped with a graphite anode and a graphite
cathode and connected to a DC power supply. Into the cell flushed
with nitrogen were taken styrene derivatives 1 (0.5 mmol),
sodium 4-methylbenzenesulfinate 2a (1.0 mmol, 178 mg),
TsOH (0.5 mmol, 86 mg), 4 Å MS (200 mg), and MeOH (8 mL). The
mixture was electrolyzed under constant current (10 mA) at room temperature
for 2.5 h. Then, the reaction was diluted with H2O (20
mL) and extracted with EtOAc (20 mL × 3). The combined organic
layers were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered,
and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography
using hexane/EtOAc (5:1, v/v) as an eluent to afford the desired product 4.
