The recycle, cleaning,
and reuse of water are highly important
for environmental remediation. This issue is addressed by creating
a fluorescent zwitterionic spirocyclic Meisenheimer complex with high
chelating propensity for toxic metals using low-cost starting materials
and a one-pot synthesis technique. The resulting material is able
to detect fluoride up to 12.8 ppb level and remove 82% aqueous fluoride
from 1000 mL of 100 ppm fluoride solution in a single contact. The
material demonstrates rapid kinetics and is capable of dropping the
toxic metal ion (Pb/Hg/Cd) concentration below 0.2 ppb within 10 min.
A resin-free, precipitation-free, and reusable technique has been
developed for the removal of toxic metal ions and fluoride from extremely
polluted water. Moreover, utilizing its extreme hydrophobicity, polystyrene
sponges have been coated with the Meisenheimer complex to mop up oil
spill and organic solvents from a biphasic mixture.

Introduction
With rapidly increasing
world population, it has become extremely
challenging to provide clean water to each and every citizen.1,2 In the agricultural sector, increasing demand for food production
is forcing us to use underground water for farming. This has increased
the fluoride and arsenic level in groundwater in some parts of the
world. Industrial waste as well as pesticides and synthetic dyes is
critically polluting the surface water. Therefore, there is a growing
interest in recognition, sensing, and removal of hazardous chemicals
which are responsible for water pollution. Among different anionic
species, sensing of fluoride ion is very interesting as it plays malevolent
as well as benevolent role in human beings.3 At a low concentration (around 1 ppm) in drinking water, fluoride
is beneficial for our dental health. It strengthens our tooth enamel
by converting hydroxyapatite present on the teeth surface to fluoroapatite
which is much harder and prevents tooth decay.4 Fluoride is also potentially useful for osteoporosis treatment.
The human body absorbs fluoride very easily, but the excretion process
is rather slow.5 Therefore, at a high concentration,
fluoride accumulation in the body can lead to osteoporosis, neurological
and metabolic dysfunctions, and cancer.6 Fluoride is extremely useful in industrial processes such as steelmaking,
aluminum refining, organic compound synthesis,7 military purposes such as uranium refinement, and so forth.8 Therefore, these industries are highly prone
to affect the local water resources. Fluoride is also released from
the hydrolysis of nerve gases such as sarin, cyclosarin, soman, and
so forth. Therefore, for a nerve gas attack, detecting fluoride in
the victim’s body as well as in the surrounding environment
is very important.9,10 In the last decade, various strategies
have been applied to sense fluoride anions.11−22

With enhancement in living standards and to fulfill basic
human
needs, a rapid growth in industrial activity has been observed in
the last couple of centuries.23 Water is
the main component for daily works in almost every industry. In most
of the cases, wastewater discharged from industries contains toxic
metals such as Cu, Ni, Cd, Hg, Cr, and Pb. As a result, the surface
water or groundwater gets contaminated by them.24 By virtue of biomagnification, the concentrations of these
metals start to increase in the food chain pyramid, and human beings
are the worst affected. Therefore, detection and removal of these
toxic metals are very much crucial.25 Various
methods have been developed for metal ion removal from drinking water
and industrial wastewater. Coagulation–flocculation and chemical
precipitation are often applied for the removal of metal ions.26 Ion exchange,27 electrolytic
reduction,28 and membrane technologies
are also very common methods.29,30 Adsorption has also
been proven to be a very effective removal process.31,32 Agricultural waste materials33 and zeolites34 are being used as adsorbing materials. Recently,
carbon nanotubes,35 ionic liquids,36 metal–organic frameworks,37−39 covalent organic frameworks,40 porous
organic polymers,41,42 nanoparticles, fullerenes, biosorbents,
and ion-imprinted polymers have been explored as solid-phase sorbents.43 However, the selective removal of different
toxic metal ions has been reported in the literature, but the universal
removal is very less.44−48 In general, an ideal material for metal removal application must
be cheap, water-insoluble, easy to synthesize, of high removal capacity,
reusable, and with an affinity for a wide variety of metal ions.

Another important aspect in water processing is the oil spill removal.
Over the years, oil spill accidents had taken place around the world
during oil transportation by ships or from natural calamities in oil
fields.49−53 These accidents pose serious threats to the marine ecosystem and
species (such as birds) relying on the marine ecosystem.54 Therefore, it is very crucial and challenging
to remove spread oils.55−59 There are different methods for oil spill recovery. For example,
absorption of the oil phase using some hydrophobic porous materials,60−62 use of dispersing agents followed by burning or left for natural
degradation,63,64 application of solidifiers,65,66 and bioremediation67 can be mentioned.
Among them, the first method being quick, with no environmental pollution
and reusable, is the most effective one. For this, different oleophilic
and hydrophobic porous materials were utilized throughout the last
decade.68−72 In this report, a single Meisenheimer complex (Scheme 1) has been applied to overcome
all these issues.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Meisenheimer Complex 1
Results and Discussion
Zwitterionic spirocyclic Meisenheimer complex 1 was
synthesized from picric acid and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.73 The
crystal structure of 1 reveals the distribution of a
negative charge over five carbons in the 2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienate
system.73 This is reminiscent of the cyclopentadienyl
anion system which is known to form different sandwich complexes with
transition metals, such as ferrocene. We have studied the effect of
various metal ions on compound 1 using absorption and
emission spectroscopy. Compound 1 has two absorption
maxima at 405 and 527 nm which are the characteristic bands of a trisubstituted
Meisenheimer complex (Figure 1a).74 Addition of a divalent or
trivalent metal ion to the methanolic solution of 1 causes
the suppression of these bands (Figure 1a). This is the direct proof of interaction of metal
ions with the π-cloud of 1. Meisenheimer complexes
are known to be fluorescent.75 This fluorescence
arises from the electron-rich cyclohexadienyl anion system. Therefore,
if the electron cloud of 1 interacts with a metal ion,
the electron density of the π-cloud diminishes and so does the
fluorescent intensity. Compound 1 is highly fluorescent
(ϕ = 0.67), and its fluorescent intensity decreases with increasing
concentration of metal ions (Figure 1b). This also confirms the metal−π-cloud
interaction. Both divalent and trivalent metal ions interact with 1 in the same manner as revealed by absorption spectroscopy
(Figure S1). The stoichiometry of binding
was determined by Job’s method. 1 binds with Fe3+ ion (FeCl3·6H2O) in 2:1 fashion
(Figure S2).

Figure 1 (a) Change of absorption
spectra of 1 with gradual
addition of the Fe3+ ion (aqueous FeCl3 solution).
(b) Fluorescence quenching of 1 with gradual addition
of the Fe3+ ion (aqueous FeCl3 solution). (c) 1H NMR titration of 1 with FeCl3·6H2O (dissolved in CD3OD) in CDCl3.

Compound 1 is a zwitterionic
species, and it is only
the negative charge which participates in the metal binding process.
Therefore, to know the fate of the positive charge within the molecule
and to further investigate every detail of the binding event, we performed
the NMR titration experiment (Figure 1c). The NMR spectrum of compound 1 (in
CDCl3) was studied with an increasing concentration of
FeCl3·6H2O (in CD3OD). The NMR
titration experiment reveals the loss of a proton from the guanidium
group of 1 as soon as 1 starts to bind with
the Fe3+ ion. The intensity of the signal at 4.53 ppm due
to the guanidium N–H starts to diminish with an increasing
concentration of the Fe3+ ion. On the basis of the demand
of the electron, the metal ion can bind with 1 in two
possible modes to produce either 2 or 3 (Figure 2a). As the fluorescence
intensity of 1 is quenched by aqueous bivalent or trivalent
metal ions, the methanolic solution of 1 can be utilized
as a preliminary detection kit for these metal ions. The kit can detect
wide varieties of transition metal ions such as Cr3+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Co3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ along with other toxic metal ions such
as Hg2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+. Compound 1 also interacts with the main group metal ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and so forth. A solution of compound 1 is orange colored. This color arises due to charge transfer
from ring π-electrons to the nitro groups.76 Upon interacting with a metal ion, this intramolecular
charge transfer stops. As a result, the typical orange color and fluorescence
of 1 vanish (Figure 2b,c).

Figure 2 (a) Possible mode of binding of 1 with different
metal
ions and the fluoride anion. Methanolic solution of 1 in the presence of different metal ions (10 equiv) under (b) natural
light and (c) 366 nm irradiation.

Compound 1 is extremely hydrophobic because
of the
presence of four bulky cyclohexyl groups. This makes compound 1 water-insoluble. It has just been discussed that compound 1 interacts with a wide variety of metal ions. On the basis
of these two important observations, compound 1 was used
as a metal-ion-removing agent from industrial wastewater. Two different
strategies were successfully applied to remove metal ions from water.
The first method deals with the addition of compound 1 to the aqueous solution of the metal ion and then sonication of
the solution for a certain time. Pure water is obtained by filtering
the sonicated mixture (Figure 3 and Video S1). The second method
is based on immobilization of compound 1 on the silica
surface and then running the polluted water through a column packed
with the immobilized compound (Figure 4). Fresh water is eluted from the outlet. This method
is more effective than the previous one. Different metal salts mostly
of perchlorate or nitrate were dissolved in deionized water. Different
aqueous metal solutions (1000 mL) of concentration 1 mM were passed
through a column freshly filled with 2 g of compound 1 immobilized over 60 g of 60–120 silica gel. The absorption
spectra were measured, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) was performed for each solution before and after the treatment.
From the absorption spectroscopy as well as ICP-MS, we can conclude
that in each case there is more than 99.99% removal of metal ions.
After several cycles, whenever the adsorption capacity of the metal
ion significantly decreases, the column has to be regenerated. The
regeneration process is very simple and quantitative. For that, ethyl
acetate is run through the column, which dissolves compound 1 along with the adsorbed metal ions. The eluting ethyl acetate
solution is washed two to three times with water, which will make
the ethyl acetate solution metal-free. Then, this pure compound 1 is immobilized again on the silica surface for reuse. This
technique was successfully applied for the purification of groundwater
containing iron and manganese impurities (Figure 5). This study indicates that compound 1 can be useful for the removal of wide varieties of divalent
and trivalent transition metal ions. The case of Cd2+ was
studied in detail. For Cd2+, equilibrium data were obtained
with initial concentrations ranging from 25 to 600 ppm. The Langmuir
model was applied to plot our adsorption data. The data fitted nicely
with a correlation coefficient of 0.995 (Figure 6). The uptake capacity was calculated in
each step, and the maximum uptake capacity was found to be 712 mg/g
with an equilibrium concentration of 180 ppm. The recyclability of
compound 1 was also investigated for three consecutive
cycles (Figure 7a).
The compound also showed similar uptake capacities for Cd2+ in second and third cycles. The effect of pH on the uptake capacity
of Cd2+ for compound 1 was also investigated
(Figure 7b). The uptake
capacity was measured at different pH values ranging from 3 to 9.
The results indicated that pH 7 is the ideal one for the maximum removal
of Cd2+ from water. At pH 2, the para carbon of 2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienate
system becomes protonated, and the complex remains no longer a Meisenheimer
complex.73 Therefore, in the absence of
a negatively charged π-cloud, the protonated compound is unable
to bind with the metal ions. While at pH 10, the guanidium proton
is abstracted, and its zwitterionic state is lost.73 Moreover, a decrease in the uptake capacity is observed.
Time-dependent removal of metal ions was also studied. The cases of
Fe3+ and Cd2+ were also studied. Highly concentrated
aqueous solutions of Fe3+ (100 ppm) and Cd2+ (48.7 ppm) were treated with compound 1, and concentrations
of the metal ions were calculated with the progress of time. More
than 99.99% removal was achieved within 30 and 40 min for Fe and Cd,
respectively (Figures S3 and 7c). To evaluate the affinity of adsorbent 1 for
metal ions, distribution coefficient values (Kd) were calculated. For Cd2+ and Fe3+, the Kd values are, respectively, 9.74
× 107 and 1.66 × 108 mL g–1. These Kd values are very good, which
indicate that compound 1 has higher binding affinity
for a trivalent metal ion than for a divalent metal ion. Now according
to the World Health Organization (WHO), the permissible limits of
Cu2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, and Fe3+ in drinking water are 1 ppm, 50, 1, 5, and
100 ppb, respectively. To check whether these metal concentrations
can be dropped below the safe limit by our material, ICP-MS was performed.
For concentration such as 5 ppm, the concentration level dropped below
0.2 ppb for Cu2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, and Fe3+ within 10 min after treating with compound 1. A breakthrough experiment was performed by passing a solution
containing Cu2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, K+, and Na+ each
having a concentration of around 5 ppm through a column packed with
compound 1. Cd2+, Hg2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ concentrations dropped
much below the WHO permissible limits for these metal ions (Figure 7d). This study indicates
the effectiveness of 1 as a highly promising adsorbent
for the removal of toxic metals from water.

of various ions is approximately 5 ppm.

The uptake capacity of 1 for other metal ions
was
also checked. For Pb2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+, the uptake capacity values are 817, 830, 451,
and 511 mg/g, respectively.

Being a zwitterionic species, compound 1 possesses
a positive charge. Therefore, some anionic species were applied such
that the positive charge of that zwitterion interacts with the anion.
Different anions were added to the THF solution of 1,
but only in the presence of a fluoride anion, significant changes
in the absorption and emission spectra were observed. The fluorescent
orange-colored THF solution of 1 becomes nonfluorescent,
and the color of the solution becomes deep red (Figure 8a,b). The binding interaction was studied
using absorption (Figure 9a) and fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure 9b). Out of the two bands, the one at 527
nm starts to diminish slowly with increasing concentration of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF). The band at 405 nm starts
to diminish rapidly, and a new maximum arises at 437 nm. In the case
of the emission spectroscopy, the fluorescence intensity of compound 1 starts to decrease with increasing concentration of TBAF.
The presence of two absorption maxima in between 400 and 600 nm confirms
that after interacting with the F– ion, the 2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienate
system in 1 remains intact. It proves that the F– ion interacts only with the positive charge of the
guanidium moiety of 1. A binding stoichiometry of 1:1
was obtained from Job’s plot (Figure S4). To know the details of the binding interaction, we performed NMR
titration with TBAF (Figure 9c). Upon addition of 1 equiv TBAF, the signal at 4.53 ppm
for the N–H proton vanishes. Therefore, the F– ion takes the proton from a zwitterionic Meisenheimer complex 1, resulting into a negatively charged Meisenheimer complex
(Figure 2a). In this
new species 4, photoinduced electron transfer (PET) occurs
from the triazene moiety to the 2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienate system.77 This is the reason for the fluorescence quenching
in 4. Addition of 1 equiv strong acid such as trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) to a solution of 4 causes the regeneration
of compound 1 (Figure S5).
Therefore, compound 1 can show a fluoride and proton-mediated
fluorescence switching phenomenon. As compound 1 responds
to only F– ion, it can be used as a fluoride sensor.
The binding constant calculated from the Benesi–Hildebrand
plot is 2.55 × 105 M–1 (Figure S6). The detection limit is 6.76 ×
10–7 M or 12.8 ppb (Figure S6).

ions and fluoride anion. (b) THF solution of 1 in the

This fluoride sensor is equally effective in detecting the
fluoride
present both in organic medium and in water. Figure S7 shows the detection of aqueous fluoride. After successfully
sensing the F– anion, we thought whether we could
apply compound 1 for fluoride removal from drinking water.
In general, there are different methods such as (i) coagulation and
precipitation, (ii) membrane-based methods, (iii) ion-exchange process,
(iv) electro-coagulation process, (v) adsorption, and so forth78 Among them, adsorption is the mostly used method
because it is of low cost, easier to apply, and very effective. We
were also successful in applying compound 1 for fluoride
removal using the same setup used for metal ion removal. We passed
1000 mL 100 ppm aqueous F– solution through that
column. Removal of the F– ion (82%) was achieved
after the first elution. Just like the case of metal ion removal,
whenever the fluoride removal efficiency decreases, the column should
be regenerated though the regeneration process is different. In this
case, the eluting solvent is 1:99 TFA/ethyl acetate. After eluting
the solvent, the solution was made neutral using triethylamine and
by washing two to three times with water. Then the ethyl acetate solution
was evaporated to get back compound 1 for further use.

Adsorption studies for F– removal were also performed.
In this case, equilibrium data were obtained with initial concentrations
ranging from 5 to 40 ppm. Also for fluoride removal, the equilibrium
adsorption isotherm data fitted nicely with the Langmuir model having
a correlation coefficient of 0.995 (Figure 10). The uptake capacity in each step was
measured, and the maximum uptake capacity was found to be 60 mg/g
with an equilibrium concentration of 8 ppm.

Figure 10 F– adsorption isotherm for compound 1. The inset shows
the linear regression by fitting the equilibrium
adsorption data with the Langmuir adsorption model.

The uptake capacity of compound 1 for
three consecutive
cycles was observed (Figure S8). No significant
drop in the uptake capacity was observed even after the third cycle.
This quality makes this compound a very promising material for a large-scale
fluoride removal process. A pH-dependent adsorption study was further
performed (Figure 11a). Also, in this case, it was found that pH 7 is the best condition
for maximum fluoride removal. Moving from pH 7 toward both higher
and lower pH values causes a decrease in the uptake capacity. At pH
10, the guanidium proton can be easily abstracted and then the fluoride
anion is not any longer able to bind with that guanidine unit.73 That is why adsorption at higher pH is not favorable.
For lower pH such as 2, the structure of the guanidine unit also changes
significantly and the complex is no longer a Meisenheimer complex.73 Therefore, at a lower pH, the uptake capacity
value decreases sharply. The removal of fluoride with time was also
studied (Figure 11b). The time-dependent adsorption study also indicated that the removal
process is kinetically favorable. To evaluate the affinity of adsorbent 1 for the fluoride ion, the distribution coefficient value
(Kd) was calculated which is 2.99 ×
106 mL g–1. According to WHO, the maximum
permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1.5 ppm. To check
whether the fluoride concentration can be dropped below the safe limit
by our material, fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with the
treated water. However, in this case, a final concentration below
10 ppb was achieved from a heavily polluted water having 10 ppm fluoride
concentration within 10 min.

of 1 at different pH values. (b) F– sorption kinetics
of 1 with F– initial concentration
of 30 ppm at a V/m ratio of 1000 mL g–1.

We have already mentioned that compound 1 is extremely
hydrophobic and we have utilized this concept for oil spill removal
from water. Normal polystyrene sponge absorbs both water and oil at
the same rate. However, after soaking a concentrated dichloromethane
solution of 1, the sponge becomes extremely hydrophobic.
The modified sponge does not absorb water (Figure 12a,b). The water contact angle was measured
to check the surface wettability (Figure 12c,d). The contact angle of normal sponge
was 58° (Figure 12d). After coating the sponge with compound 1, the contact
angle value increased to 131° (Figure 12c). Oil droplets were immediately absorbed
by the coated sponge. These facts suggest that there is an increment
in the hydrophobicity after coating the sponge with compound 1. FE-SEM images of the normal sponge as well as the coated
sponge were recorded (Figure S9). The modified
sponge exhibits significant changes in morphology, suggesting that
the sponge surface has been coated with compound 1 (Figure S9). This modified sponge can absorb a
wide variety of oils and organic solvents. It has been utilized to
remove oil spill and organic solvents from the water surface (Figure S10 and Video S2).

sponge and normal sponge in water. (c) Water contact angle of coated
sponge (131°). (d) Water contact angle of normal sponge (58°).
(e) Weight gain (%) of the modified sponge for different oils. (f)
Weight gain (%) of the modified sponge (in the case of petrol) for
10 consecutive cycles.

The sponge can remove heavier organic solvents such as chloroform
from the bottom of the water layer (Figure S11 and Video S3). With the help of a suction
pump, oils and lighter organic solvents were removed using this modified
hydrophobic sponge (Video S4). The oils
separated by this method can also be used after a normal distillation
process. The weight gain (%) of the sponge was calculated in the presence
of different oils and organic solvents (Figure 12e). Being a charged species, compound 1 is well-adsorbed on the surface of the sponge. As a result,
compared to other neutral hydrophobic compounds, leaching of 1 from the sponge surface occurs slowly. The consecutive weight
gain (%) of the sponge was also determined for 10 cycles for the recovery
of petrol from water (Figure 8f).

Conclusions
This study explored the use of a zwitterionic
spirocyclic Meisenheimer
complex for its ability to remove 99.99% toxic metal ions from water
for environmental remediation purposes. A zwitterionic spirocyclic
Meisenheimer complex was successfully utilized as a highly efficient
fluoride sensor which can detect fluoride present both in organic
and in aqueous media. An eco-friendly and cheap sorbent was developed
for the removal of oil spills from water by coating the zwitterionic
spirocyclic Meisenheimer complex on a porous matrix. Normal polystyrene
sponge was chosen as the matrix, and the Meisenheimer complex was
chosen as the surface modifier to convert the sorbent hydrophobic.
Because of the hydrophobic nature and high porosity of the modified
sponge, it absorbs the oil into the voids instantaneously. The modified
sponge does not absorb water. Moreover, the sponge can remove heavier
organic solvents such as chloroform from the bottom of the water.
Using pressure or a suction pump, the oil can be easily collected
from the modified sponge. The modified sponge shows very high oil
soaking capacity with different kinds of crude oils. The modified
sponge is also superior to all the known sorbents as it overcomes
all the usual limitations such as secondary spill containment and
uptake of water, thus making this system attractive toward the implementation
in the industrial scale. This strategy of mopping up the oil, metals,
and fluoride ions through hierarchical encapsulation by a zwitterionic
spirocyclic Meisenheimer complex not only provides pure water but
also cleans the environment and recovers the valuable resources.
