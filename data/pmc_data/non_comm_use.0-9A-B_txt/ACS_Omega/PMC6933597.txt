MgO
nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used in diverse areas ranging
from catalysis to sensing. Besides this, there is a lack of information
regarding their toxicity on fauna and flora. The venture of this work
is to evaluate the toxicity behavior and pH-sensing performance of l-lysine-modified MgO (Ly-MgO) NPs synthesized by the green
approach using the clove (Syzygium aromaticum) bud extract. The detailed investigations revealed that concentration
plays an important role toward in vitro toxicity of Ly-MgO NPs. The
Ly-MgO NPs showed 105% biocompatibility toward Vigna
radiata (green gram) seeds at 100 ppm concentration.
Zero inhibition on microbial growth was observed toward two bacterial
strains. Further, pH-sensing strips based on these Ly-MgO nanostructures
were developed to test pH-sensing performance at pH values ranging
from 2.0 to 13.0. The repeatability as well as recyclability of the
prepared pH strips was also analyzed. Nanobased pH paper strips based
on Ly-MgO NPs provide a simple, reliable, nontoxic, and affordable
method for pH measurements.

1 Introduction
Metal-oxide
nanoparticles (NPs) are of great scientific and technological
interest because of their tremendous applications in the fields of
electronics,1 catalysis,2,3 sensing,4,5 drug delivery,6,7 and so forth. Various metal-oxide
NPs like CuO, NiO, ZnO, and MgO have attracted a great deal of attention
in recent years as they are safe to use and can withstand harsh conditions
as well.8 Among these, MgO NPs are of particular
interest due to their remarkable electronic, mechanical, and optical
properties.9 They have been used as a medicine
for heart burn,10 superconducting products,11 and recently in catalysis also.12,13 Because MgO NPs are quite stable and well dispersed, hence they
are well suited for the diverse applications. Widely, various chemical
and physical methods have been used for the synthesis of MgO NPs such
as sol–gel process,14,15 hydrothermal,16 coprecipitation,17 and so forth. Most of these methods employ chemical reducing agents
and harmful surfactants as stabilizing agents. In general, chemical
synthesis of NPs is expensive leading to hazardous effects on human
beings and environment. Therefore, the synthesis of NPs through biological
integrals is preferred over the conventional methods, owing to its
eco-friendly nature and cost-effectiveness. The use of plant extract
for the synthesis of NPs has emerged as one of the most favorable
biological approach. Plant extracts contain various biomolecules which
act as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent. In the present work,
the clove bud extract has been used as a reducing and stabilizing
agent for the green synthesis of MgO NPs. Further, the synthesized
MgO NPs were modified with a water-soluble amino acid, that is, l-lysine. In general, amino acids play an indispensable role
in human body18 because they help to absorb
calcium, iron, and zinc, which are useful in bone development and19 healthy skin and hair. Further, amino acids
in form of dose are used to treat cancer because excess of amino acids
cause shrinking of tumor cells.20−22l-lysine is an essential
amino acid (Figure 1), which cannot be synthesized in our body. It plays an imperative
role in the treatment of various diseases like cancer,23 Alzheimer’s dementia,24 and cardiovascular diseases.25 Herein, we report the single-step combination of positively charged l-lysine with negatively charged MgO NPs and their use for fluorimetric
pH sensing in aqueous medium.

Figure 1 Structures of l-lysine in different
pH media.

It is well known that pH plays
a key role among various chemical
parameters and physiological processes in living organisms and the
different environmental niches. pH determination is a strong prerequisite
in various chemical, biochemical industries,26 waste water management processes,27 and
intracellular regulatory processes.28 Among
the different pH measurement methods, use of litmus paper strips is
by far one of the most common and convenient method for pH sensing
in aqueous solutions in the laboratory. Here, two different litmus
paper strips are used to distinguish among acidic and alkaline solutions.
Although the use of litmus paper strips is a simple and quick method
but they cannot be reused and involve the use of two different paper
strips. Here, for the first time, we have developed a single and reusable
nanobased pH-sensing strip for the detection of pH in aqueous solutions.
A variety of NP-based pH sensors27−29 have been developed
so far, but their toxicity toward various organisms is still relatively
unexplored, and their mechanism of action is still in need of deeper
study.30−32 The escalated use of NPs in variety of applications
related to industrial products ultimately lead their discharge into
the environment. Hence, the information regarding the toxicity imparted
by NPs on microbiota, fauna, and flora should exist. Therefore, studies
of the biocompatibility of NPs are necessary for their rational design
and use in sensing applications.

With the commitment of safer
commercialized use, the researchers
must be focused on safety concerns owing to potential hazards caused
by nanosensors. Toxicity profiling of existing nanosensors has not
been investigated so far. With regard to this, we have made an attempt
to assess the phytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of the developed
Ly-MgO NP-based fluorescent pH sensor. The phytotoxicity was analyzed
by seed germination assay of Vigna radiata seeds, and the antimicrobial activity was tested against two bacterial
strains, that is, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram negative). In this scientific report, we present the novel,
reusable, inexpensive, biocompatible, and safer Ly-MgO-based pH strips.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
of Ly-MgO NPs
Figure 2a represents
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of l-lysine,
MgO, and Ly-MgO NPs. The peak at 652 cm–1 (Figure 2a) strongly evidenced
the Mg–O stretching.33 The spectrum
in Figure 2a showed
characteristic −NH2 stretching frequencies of l-lysine at 2922 and 2865 cm–1. Two more important
asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies of carboxylate (COO–) were observed at 1519 and 1402 cm–1, respectively.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of (a) MgO, Ly-MgO NPs and l-lysine
(b) suggested
linkage of l-lysine and MgO.

The FTIR spectrum of Ly-MgO showed these symmetric and asymmetric
stretching of the carboxyl group at 1574 and 1358 cm–1 (Figure 2a). Splitting
between asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the carboxyl group,
that is, Δν (νasym OCO –
νsym OCO) was greater than the splitting in
the FTIR spectrum of uncoordinated l-lysine. This observation
indicated the unidentate coordination between carboxyl anions and
Mg2+ ions (Figure 2b). Therefore, l-lysine remains chemisorbed on the
surface of MgO NPs. Further, the peak at 3406 cm–1 in the FTIR of MgO NPs is prominent in the FTIR spectrum of Ly-MgO,
which may be because of the coating of l-lysine on the surface
of MgO NPs that were covered with phenolic moieties from the plant
extract, showing O–H stretching frequency. Other peaks in the
FTIR spectrum of Ly-MgO and MgO corresponded to various functional
groups present in the biomolecules in the clove extract (CE). FTIR
analysis suggested l-lysine coordinated to the MgO surface.

The crystalline nature and size of synthesized MgO NPs and Ly-MgO
NPs was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Synthesized
NPs showed a broad peak at 20°–30° (Figure 3a), which clearly indicated
the purely amorphous nature of MgO NPs. The absence of peaks at 36.94°,
42.90°, 62.30°, 74.67°, and 78.61° (JCPDS2-1095)
corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222), respectively,
indicated the absence of any crystal plane in MgO NPs. Further, the
broadness of peak indicated the biosynthesized MgO NPs to be in the
nano range and covered with various biological moieties that provide
amorphous nature to MgO NPs. The XRD pattern of Ly-MgO was almost
similar to the XRD pattern of MgO NPs.

Figure 3 (a) XRD pattern of MgO
and Ly-MgO NPs and (b) DLS of Ly-MgO NPs.

Various amorphous metal-oxide NPs synthesized using leaf extracts
of different plants have also been reported previously.34−36 Moreover, the synthesis of MgO NPs was confirmed by taking the XRD
pattern of calcined MgO NPs (Figure S1).
For this, Ly-MgO NPs were calcined at 700 °C for an hour to remove
the biological moieties from the plant extract and l-lysine.
The XRD pattern of calcined Ly-MgO NPs indicated the peaks at 31.23°,
42.91°, and 62.24° (ICSD-01-071-1176), corresponding to
the planes (111), (200), and (220), respectively. This XRD pattern
was used for crystallite size determination of calcined Ly-MgO from
Debye Scherrer eq 1 1  where D is the crystallite
size of calcined Ly-MgO NPs, θ is the Bragg’s angle,
λ is the wavelength of the X-ray source (1.5406 Å) used,
β is the breadth of pure diffraction profile in radian on 2θ,
and k is the Scherrer constant with a value from 0.9 to 1. The full-width
at half maximum value measured from the most intense peak obtained
from the XRD pattern (Figure S1) corresponding
to 42.91° was found to be 0.3346. The crystallite size of calcined
Ly-MgO NPs determined from the Debye Scherrer equation was found to
be 4.5 nm.

The dynamic light scattering (DLS) method revealed
that most of
the NPs were centered on 324 nm, as shown in Figure 3b, with the polydispersity index of 0.251,
indicating the formation of various sized NPs.

Thermal stability
of Ly-MgO was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA). TGA curves for MgO and Ly-MgO NPs are represented in Figure 4a,b. The weight-loss
scale allows a quantitative comparison of degradation behavior of
both samples. MgO NPs showed two staged degradation at 75 and 280
°C. The weight-loss peak at 75 °C was because of physisorbed
water molecules, and the peak at 280 °C was because of the loss
of CE. In the TGA of Ly-MgO, one additional peak at 393–445
°C was observed, which indicates the weight loss due to degradation
of chemisorbed l-lysine molecules on the surface of MgO.

Figure 4 TGA thermograms
of biosynthesized (a) MgO NPs and (b) Ly-MgO NPs.

Further, size distribution of Ly-MgO NPs was determined by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Figure 5a represents the typical TEM image, and Figure 5b shows the size
distribution histogram of Ly-MgO NPs. The TEM image revealed that
most of the NPs are spherical in shape. Some of the NPs are irregular
in shape. The TEM image was analyzed by Image J software to obtain
the size distribution histogram by measuring at least 356 NPs. The
histogram was fitted by using a long normal function. A mean size
of 7 nm was obtained for Ly-MgO NPs. Polydispersity of Ly-MgO came
to be 23%.

Figure 5 (a) TEM image and (b) Histogram of the TEM image of biosynthesized
Ly-MgO NPs.

A field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) micrograph
was used to investigate the surface structure and topography of Ly-MgO
NPs. The FESEM image of synthesized Ly-MgO is shown in Figure 6a, which clearly demonstrates
that Ly-MgO NPs were uniformly distributed with approximately same
dimensions. Most of the NPs were irregular in shape, which is the
characteristics of biosynthesized NPs.37 Coating of l-lysine can be confirmed from EDS data (Figure 6b), which demonstrated
the elemental composition of Ly-MgO NPs. The peak corresponding to
carbon indicates the presence of organic moieties on the surface of
MgO NPs. Further, the peaks corresponding to nitrogen, magnesium,
and oxygen were because of l-lysine in Ly-MgO NPs. EDS for
bare MgO NPs (Figure S2) showed the peaks
corresponding to Mg, O, and C. The peak corresponding to N was found
absent in MgO because of the absence of l-lysine.

and (b) EDS spectrum of biosynthesized Ly-MgO NPs.

2.2 Toxicological Profiling
2.2.1 Antibacterial
Activity of Ly-MgO NPs
The toxicity of NPs against microorganisms
can be evaluated by the
antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the antibacterial activity of both
MgO and Ly-MgO was assessed for two types of bacteria, that is, P. aureginosa (Gram negative) and S. aureus (Gram positive) by subjecting them to different
concentrations of MgO and Ly-MgO NPs. No zone of inhibition was observed
in both Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial strains (Figure 7) in each treatment
at each concentration because the diameter of the effective zone of
inhibition was found exactly the same as in the control. It can be
depicted that the synthesized Ly-MgO NPs have no inhibitory effect
on the growth of microorganisms even at concentration as high as 1000
ppm.

Figure 7 Toxicity profiling of MgO and Ly-MgO against two bacterial strains.

Even in case of biosynthesized MgO NPs without l-lysine
functionalization, the zero zone of inhibition was observed against
both Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial strains at each concentration.
Both MgO and Ly-MgO NPs showed 100% biocompatibility toward both bacterial
strains. This can be explained on the basis of the green approach
for the synthesis of NPs using CE. Most of chemical and biological
properties of nanomaterials depend upon the mode of their synthesis.
The biological synthesis provides eco-friendly and biocompatible nature
to NPs.

2.2.2 Seed Germination Assay
The green
gram seeds were subjected to the seed germination assay (Figure 8a) to ascertain the
phytotoxicity imparted by MgO and Ly-MgO NPs. The germination tendency
and root lengths of seed are most affected because of the strong tendency
of NPs to accumulate on the surface of roots. The toxicity level and
biocompatibility of NPs were ascertained by determining the root length
difference between the control and NPs at each concentration. The
values of different parameters, that is, germination rate (GR), germination
index (GI), RL, and percentage of inhibition (PIG) (Table S1 and S2) emerged for green gram seeds were determined
for each treatment (Figures 8a–e and 9a–d). The maximum
root length of 0.93 cm was observed in 100 ppm treatment, which was
even higher than the control experiment (0.88 cm). Root lengths showed
only 32% decrease in root length even at concentration as high as
1500 ppm. A negative value of PIG was observed at 100 ppm (Table S1), which depicts the negative inhibition
effect of Ly-MgO NPs on the growth of seeds. Even at higher concentrations
upto 1500 ppm, PIG was found to be as low as 0.210.

assay with MgO and Ly-MgO NPs, and values of parameters (b) GR%, (c)
GI, (d) Mean RL, and (e) PIG on treatment with Ly-MgO NPs as a function
of their concentration (ppm).

Figure 9 (a) GR%,
(b) GI, (c) mean RL, and (d) PIG on treatment with MgO
NPs as a function of their concentration (ppm).

Further, measured biocompatibility in comparison to control was
about 45.4% at 2500 ppm for Ly-MgO, which further enhanced to 59,
63, 77, 96, and 105% for 2000, 1500, 1000, 500, and 100 ppm concentrations.
Biocompatibility in case of MgO NPs was 57.9, 62.5, 67, 67, 79, and
83% at 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 500, and 100 ppm concentrations. Although
bare MgO was also found to be more than 50% biocompatible, still they
are comparatively less biocompatible as compared to Ly-MgO NPs. In
addition to this, even root lengths of seeds in case of bare MgO NPs
were found to be less than those for l-lysine-coated MgO
NPs (Table S2.). The investigational studies
mentioned above demonstrated biocompatibility of both MgO and Ly-MgO
NPs toward plants and bacteria. It might be due to the fact that these
NPs have been synthesized by the green approach using the plant extract
as the reducing and stabilizing agent, which imparted the nontoxic
character to the synthesized MgO and Ly-MgO NPs. Further, l-lysine coating on the surface of NPs was responsible for enhanced
biocompatibility of Ly-MgO NPs. Therefore, Ly-MgO NPs can be considered
as nontoxic and safe candidates for sensing applications in aqueous
solutions.

2.2.3 pH-Sensing Applicability
The synthesized
MgO and Ly-MgO NPs were found to luminescent, showing emission peaks
at 475 and 495 nm. The origin of emission can be explained on the
basis of the electron hole recombination process. Luminescence occurs
by transition of electrons and holes between electronic states, that
is, valence band and conduction band (in crystalline materials), and
tail states and gap states, that is, localized states38−40 (in amorphous materials as in the present case).

Interestingly,
we noticed that Ly-MgO showed change in fluorescence emission wavelength
as well as intensity in acidic and basic pH media while studying the
fluorescence emission of Ly-MgO at different pH values. Figure 10a,b shows the emission
spectra of Ly-MgO NPs in aqueous solution of pH, ranging from 2.0
to 13.0, and in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. No significant
change in fluorescence emission wavelength and intensity was observed
in spectra of bare MgO NPs (Figure 10d). Based on this phenomenon, we tried to address the
issue that whether Ly-MgO proposed could be an ideal candidate for
pH sensing. The observed emission behavior of Ly-MgO NPs in different
media can be ascribed to the fact that change in acidic and alkaline
media causes protonation and deprotonation of carboxylate and amino
groups of l-lysine, which results into increased or decreased
electrostatic interactions among l-lysine and MgO NPs. These
interactions lead to alterations in n−π* and π–π*
transitions in Ly-MgO NPs.

Figure 10 Fluorescence spectra of Ly-MgO NPs (a) at different
pH values,
(b) in acidic and basic media, (c) linear plot of emission wavelength
at different pH values, (d) fluorescence spectra of MgO NPs at different
pH values, and (e) linear plot of charge on the surface of MgO at
different pH values.

Further, Figure 10b indicated the increase in
fluorescent intensity along with emission
wavelength. This can be explained on the basis of the fact that the
charge on the NP surface depends upon pH of the solution. At some
intermediate pH value, at which the charge on the surface of NPs is
zero is known as the point of zero charge (ZPC). Below this point,
there is a net positive charge on the surface of NPs, and at pH above
ZPC, negative charge persists. The value of ZPC for synthesized MgO
NPs was calculated from the linear plot of charge versus pH (Figure 10e), using relation y = 349.835 + (−54.471)x. The ZPC
for MgO NPs was observed at a pH value of 6.42. From here, we can
conclude that at pH value above 6.42, there is a net negative charge
on the surface that could strongly bind to cationic amino acid (l-lysine), resulting into increase in emission wavelength. At
pH below 6.42, there is a decrease in emission wavelength with decrease
in the pH value because of the reduced electrostatic interaction between
cationic l-lysine and positively charged MgO NPs. Hence,
the shift in fluorescence emission wavelength and intensity was because
of the enhanced binding of l-lysine on the surface of MgO
NPs at pH higher than 6.42, which results into red shift in n−π*
and π–π* transitions in Ly-MgO NPs.

From
the above discussion, it can be concluded that change in pH
causes change in surface charge, and the electrostatic interaction
between lysine and MgO NPs, which leads to refilling and depleting
of valence bands, causes variation in n−π* and π–π*
transitions in the nanodomain of Ly-MgO NPs.41−43

In addition
to this, careful investigation of emission wavelengths
at different pH values revealed that the fluorescence emission wavelength
of Ly-MgO varies linearly with pH values from 2.0 to 13.0. The fluorescence
peak was shifted from 451 to 496 nm, with the regression constant
for linear increase in emission wavelength with the pH value (Figure 10c) was found to
be 0.994 with equation (y = 3.97x + 442.03).

Further, a prominent visible change in the color
of Ly-MgO NPs-based
pH-sensing strips was observed in acidic and basic media from pale
yellow to orange yellow, respectively, as shown in Figure 11. Reversibly, the color of
Ly-MgO strip again came back to pale yellow when adjusted to the acidic
range, proposing that the variation of pH may affect electrostatic
interactions between coated l-lysine and MgO, which leads
to variation in n−π* and π–π* transitions.

Figure 11 Visible
changes in color of Ly-MgO NP-based pH-sensing strips in
alkaline and acidic solutions.

In addition to this, the pH-sensing activity of Ly-MgO-based strips
was tested for all strong (H2SO4, HNO3) and weak acids (CH3COOH) and bases (KOH, NH4OH) available in the laboratory. The Ly-MgO-based pH-sensing strips
showed excellent and consistent response to each acidic and basic
solution.

Further, repeatability and reproducibility of the
Ly-MgO sensor
was explored. Sensor’s repeatability or reusablity refers to
the consecutive runs made by using a single sensor to check consistency
in its response.44 The reusability of Ly-MgO
sensor was studied by using a single-sensor solution (Ly-MgO) and
pH-sensing strip for six times at two different pH values of 2.0 and
13.0 (Figure 12),
illustrating the excellent repeatability of Ly-MgO. It can be explained
on the basis of alternative protonation and deprotonation of Ly-MgO
NPs in acidic and basic media. It was observed that there was slight
fatigue for the pH-sensing response after six runs. On the other hand,
sensor reproducibility refers to the sensor consistency in the response
of a batch of similarly synthesized sensor samples. The reproducibility
of three similarly synthesized Ly-MgO sensor samples was checked to
measure the pH-sensing response at pH 2.0 and 13.0.

NPs at pH values 2 and 13 in different
cycles and (b) Corresponding reusability of the sensor.

2.3 Effect of Ionic Strength
The effect
of ionic strength of solution on the pH sensor was examined by exposing
the pH sensor to 100 μM NaCl solution. A 3 mL aliquot of Ly-MgO
NP solution was diluted with 100 μM NaCl solution instead of
double-distilled water (DDW). The pH of each solution was varied from
2.0 to 13.0. Each solution of different pH values was analyzed by
a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Figure 13a represents the emission spectra of Ly-MgO
NPs at different pH values in the presence of 100 μM NaCl solution.
Similarly, Figure 13b represents the comparison of emission wavelength at different pH
values in the presence of 100 μM NaCl with emission spectra
in the presence of DDW (Table 1).

NPs at different pH values in the presence

of Ly-MgO NPs at different pH values in the presence and absence of
100 μM NaCl.

2.4 Comparison with Literature
The advantage
of the present work is the green and environment friendly synthesis
of the pH-sensing system. Further, ease of fabrication in terms of
cost and time makes it a better candidate for simple and quick detection
of pH.

3 Conclusions
The
current scientific study accentuated on the toxicological profiling
of synthesized Ly-MgO NPs for pH-sensing applications. The Ly-MgO
NPs were successfully synthesized using the green approach and characterized
by various techniques like FTIR, DLS, XRD, TGA, TEM, and FESEM. Toxicity
evaluation using the multiassay approach demonstrated the appreciable
biocompatibility and nontoxicity toward bacteria and green gram seeds.
Here, for the first time, we have developed pH-sensing strips based
on green-synthesized l-lysine-coated MgO NPs. These pH-sensing
strips were tested over a range of pH, that is, from 2.0 to 13.0.
Ly-MgO NP-based pH-sensing strips provided the advantages of excellent
repeatability, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, safe, and quick
detection of pH. Effect of ionic strength on the pH sensing ability
was also illustrated. The endeavor of the present work signifies the
potential applicability of the developed environmentally benign pH-sensing
strips for the detection of pH in aqueous solutions for commercial
purposes in the near future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Magnesium acetate tetrahydrate
[Mg(COOCH3)2·4H2O] (99%), HCl,
NaOH, HgCl2, and NaCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. l-lysine was obtained from Fluka. For the strip preparation,
Whatman filter paper (Grade-1) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
chemicals were of analytical grade unless specified otherwise and
were used as such. Clove buds and V. radiata seeds were purchased from local market (Sector 32, Chandigarh).
DDW was used in all the experiments.

4.2 Fabrication
of Ly-MgO NPs
Initially,
CE was prepared according to our published procedure.50 Briefly, 2 gm of clove bud powder was put into 50 mL of
DDW and boiled for 2 min. This solution was cooled and centrifuged
twice at 7000 rpm for 10 min to get a clear solution. 25 mL of CE
was obtained from this procedure.

Then, MgO NPs were prepared
using CE according to the previously reported procedure.51 For this, 1 M solution of magnesium acetate
and CE were mixed in the 1:1 ratio. The resulting mixture was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature. The MgO NPs were separated from solution
by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 20 min. The obtained NPs were washed
with DDW and ethanol. The NPs were dried using rotary evaporation.
Then, MgO NPs were dried in a desiccator. These dried NPs were used
as such for modification.

Further, synthesized MgO NPs were
modified with l-lysine.
For this, pH of 0.05 M solution of l-lysine was adjusted
at 9.59, which corresponds to the isoelectric point of l-lysine.
MgO NPs (40 mg)were added to 10 mL of aqueous l-lysine solution.
This mixture was stirred magnetically for 1 h. l-Lysine-modified
MgO NPs were separated by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm.

4.3 Characterization
4.3.1 Fluorescence Measurements
All experiments
were performed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi-7000)
under fluorescence mode with a Xenon lamp. The emission slits were
set at 10 nm slit width. A 3.5 mL quartz cuvette with 10 mm path length
containing 3 mL of solution was used for spectral measurement. The
excitation and emission wavelengths were 390 and 415 nm with a scan
rate of 500 nm min–1, respectively.

4.3.2 FTIR Measurements
To identify the
functional groups, Ly-MgO NPs were subjected to FTIR spectroscopy
(Shimadzu, Japan) in the working range of 4000–400 cm–1. For this, 2 mg of powdered sample was transferred to a sample cabinet.
A good signal to noise ratio was obtained by taking 256 scans per
sample.

4.3.3 Particle Size Analysis
Initially,
an approximate size of NPs was determined by DLS using a particle
size analyser (Malvern, ZEN 1690). For this, an aliquot of the 100
μL Ly-MgO NPs was diluted with 2 mL of DDW and was dispersed
using a probe sonicator for 5 min. The samples were then injected
into the cuvette using a 5 mL disposable syringe such that no air
bubble was entrapped. Each sample was analyzed using Zeta sizer software
on automatic mode with 3 min equilibration time.

4.3.4 X-ray Diffraction
Crystallographic
analysis of NPs was carried out using a Panalytical D/Max-2500 powder
diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ =
1.5406 Å) over 2θ range of 5°–90° at the
scan rate of 2° min–1. The operational voltage
and current were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The size of NPs was
calculated using the Debye Scherrer equation.

4.3.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The
thermal stability of Ly-MgO NPs was determined using thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA-SDTQ600). TGA thermograms were recorded for 5 mg of
the powdered sample at the heating rate of 10 °C in the temperature
range of 20–1000 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.

4.3.6 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron
microscopic analysis was performed to determine
the size and morphology of Ly-MgO NPs using a Hitachi H-7500 microscope.
For TEM studies, the carbon-coated 200 mesh copper grid was dipped
into a solution of MgO NPs dispersed in DDW.

4.3.7 Field-Emission
Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology and elemental
composition of Ly-MgO were determined
by FESEM micrograph and EDS on the Hitachi SU8010 field-emission scanning
electron microscope and Oxford energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer,
respectively.

4.4 Toxicological Profiling
of Ly-MgO NPs
Applications of MgO NPs in various potential
fields, that is, catalysis,2,3 sensing,4,5 and drug delivery,6,7 require
toxicological profiling of these NPs to determine their impact on
the ecosystem. In this study, we have used a multiassay approach to
evaluate the toxicity imparted by MgO and Ly-MgO NPs on commonly found
microorganisms and flora in the environment prior to their use as
the pH sensor.

4.4.1 Toxicity Evaluation on
the Flora—V. radiata Seed Germination
Assay
For the
evaluation of phytotoxicity, V. radiata seeds were washed using 0.1% mercuric chloride solution for sterilization,
followed by 3–4 washings with DDW to completely remove the
mercuric chloride residues.52 The sterilized
seeds were soaked overnight in DDW. Next day, 10 seeds were transferred
to Petri dishes. Further, the seeds in the Petri dishes were soaked
in 8 mL aqueous solutions of MgO and Ly-MgO NPs at different concentrations,
that is, 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 500 and 100 ppm. The Petri dishes
containing soaked green gram seeds were kept under the dark and warm
conditions for 72 h. Number of seeds germinated and root lengths in
each case was measured. All the experiments were performed in triplicates
to avoid the chances of error. GR, that is, percentage of germinated
seeds in each plate, GI, PIG, and vigor index were measured for the
germinated seeds using following formulae 2   3   4   5  Nt = no. of germinated
seeds for each treatment, Nc = no. of
germinated seeds in control Lc, and LN = mean root length of germinated seeds in
control and each treatment, respectively.

4.4.2 Toxicity
Evaluation on Microorganisms—Antibacterial
Activity Testing
The antibacterial activity of synthesized
MgO and Ly-MgO NPs was tested against two different strains of bacteria S. aureus (Gram positive) and P. aeruginosa (Gram negative). The antibacterial activity is useful to assess
the toxicity of NPs to ensure their safe use in various biological
applications.53 For this, the well diffusion
method was employed. In this method, sterilized Petridishes were filled
with 25 mL of autoclave-sterilized Muller Hinton (MH) agar and allowed
to solidify. Further, 200 μL of activated bacterial cultures
were spread over the surface of MH agar, and the wells of 5 mm diameters
were punctured in each Petri dish. Aliquots (100 μL) of NP solutions
of different concentrations (1000, 500, 200, and 100 ppm) were poured
into the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to
develop the zone of inhibition. The sterilized water was used as the
control, and each experiment was carried out in triplicates. The effective
zone of inhibition was measured with ruler and determined by subtracting
the zone of inhibition observed in control experiment.

4.5 pH Sensing by Ly-MgO
To check the
pH-sensing performance of Ly-MgO NPs, 10 mg of Ly-MgO NPs was dispersed
in 20 mL of DDW by using a probe sonicator for 15 min. This solution
was further diluted with DDW to 60 mL. The pH of this solution was
adjusted to 3.0. Then, 3 mL portions of this solution were diluted
two times with DDW. The pH of each solution was set from 2.0 to 13.0
using 0.1 N HCl and 0.1 N NaOH. These solutions were analyzed as such
using a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer at an excitation
wavelength of 390 nm.

4.6 Effect of Ionic Strength
To check
the effect of ionic strength on the pH sensing ability of Ly-MgO NPs,
3 mL portions of Ly-MgO NP solution of different pH values were taken.
To the 3 mL of each solution, 3 mL of 100 μM NaCl solution was
added. Each solution was again analyzed by a fluorescence spectrophotometer.

4.7 Preparation of Ly-MgO-Based pH-Sensing Paper
Strips
For the preparation of pH-sensing paper strips, 10
mg of Ly-MgO NPs was dispersed in 5 mL of water by sonication for
30 min. A strip with dimensions 3.5 cm × 0.5 cm was cut from
the Whatman filter paper. This strip was impregnated with Ly-MgO solution.
Then, Ly-MgO-based pH-sensing paper strips were dried in an oven at
40 °C. The process of impregnation followed by drying was repeated
five times to saturate the paper strip with Ly-MgO NPs. These Ly-MgO
pH-sensing paper strips were used as such for the detection of pH.
