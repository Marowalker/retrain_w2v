The elucidation of
conformations and relative potential energies
(rPEs) of small molecules has a long history across a diverse range
of fields. Periodically, it is helpful to revisit what conformations
have been investigated and to provide a consistent theoretical framework
for which clear comparisons can be made. In this paper, we compute
the minima, first- and second-order saddle points, and torsion-coupled
surfaces for methanol, ethanol, propan-2-ol, and propanol using consistent
high-level MP2 and CCSD(T) methods. While for certain molecules more
rigorous methods were employed, the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/aug-cc-pV5Z
theory level was used throughout to provide relative energies of all
minima and first-order saddle points. The rPE surfaces were uniformly
computed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level. To the
best of our knowledge, this represents the most extensive study for
alcohols of this kind, revealing some new aspects. Especially for
propanol, we report several new conformations that were previously
not investigated. Moreover, two metrics are included in our analysis
that quantify how the selected surfaces are similar to one another
and hence improve our understanding of the relationship between these
alcohols.

Introduction
Understanding
the conformational space of molecules and their underlying
relative potential energy (rPE) surfaces are important goals in scientific
disciplines whose experimental observables can be explained at a molecular
level. Sophisticated quantum mechanics theories have proven to be
a powerful tool in providing the structures and relative energies
of minima that are as accurate as those provided by experimental spectroscopy.1−4 An advantage that quantum mechanics has over experimental methods
is its relative ease in characterizing first- and second-order saddle
points and to elucidate the three-dimensional rPE surfaces generated
by coupling two internal coordinates (e.g., two torsion angles). This
is especially important if energy barriers are comparably low between
minima. However, due to their computational cost, studies that employ
theory levels capable of reproducing experimental data generally limit
themselves to small molecules and to their stationary points. Nevertheless,
the information drawn from small molecules can be very helpful and
generalized in some respects.

In this paper we present the minima,
first- and second-order saddle
points, and torsion-coupled rPE surfaces of the four smallest alcohol
molecules—methanol, ethanol, propan-2-ol, and propanol—computed
at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/aug-cc-pVnZ (n = T or 5) theory level.
Our motivation for this study is to (1) provide a comprehensive comparison
of the minima and first-order saddle points using a single rigorous
theory level, (2) better understand the qualitative and quantitative
nature of the rPE surfaces formed by the coupling between two torsion
angles, and (3) determine the degree of similarity between comparable
surfaces. The results presented herein, and in particular those associated
with propanol, could be used by experimentalists in their data interpretation.
Theoreticians developing force fields could use the results as target
benchmark data in parameter optimization or in the development of
new functional forms.

Results
The MP2/aV5Z structures
for all minima and first-order saddle points
are presented in Figures 1, 2, and Supporting Information Figure 1, as well as in xyz-formatted files in
the Supporting Information material. The
values of the selected internal coordinates are given in Supporting Information Tables 1–4, as
optimized at HF/6-31G(d), MP2/VTZ, MP2/aVTZ, MP2/VQZ, MP2/aVQZ, and
MP2/aV5Z theory levels and include experimental values when available. Table 1 provides the rotational
constants determined using MP2/aVTZ (i.e., the theory at which vibrational
analyses were performed), coupled cluster, and experimental microwave
geometries. The corresponding root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs)
for each fully optimized conformation with respect to MP2/aV5Z geometries
are given in Supporting Information Table
5 and are summarized in Table 2.

The CCSD(T) rPE surfaces formed by the coupling of two torsion
angles within ethanol, propanol, and propan-2-ol are shown in Figures 3–5, and Supporting Information Figure 2. The corresponding rPEs that generated these figures are
given in Supporting Information Tables
7–13. For ethanol, the rPEs along the motion of single torsion
angles, relative to their local minimum, are given in Supporting Information Figures 3 and 4, with
corresponding values in Supporting Information Tables 14 and 15. For propanol’s surfaces, all of the rPEs
were determined by identifying the lowest energy across all surfaces
generated. That is opposed to the rPEs using the minima within each
surface, which would disallow direct quantitative comparisons to be
made between them.

To quantify the overall “repulsiveness”
of an rPE
surface involving methyl rotation, an average of the rPEs for each
surface was computed. The average CCSD(T) rPE of the surfaces that
are defined by the coupling of the methyl and hydroxyl rotations (i.e., Figures 3, 5, and Supporting Information Figure 2) is given in Table 8. Differences between the resulting averaged
rPE are also provided as a metric for evaluating if one surface is
generally more repulsive or stable than another surface. Table 8 also gives the similarity
between two surfaces as determined by computing their similarity index
using the following equation15,16 1  where uia and uib are the values
of the rPE on surfaces
a and b, i specifies a specific point defined by
the internal coordinates [i.e., (ϕ,ψ)], and m is the total number of rPEs on each surface. The closer the index
is to +1, the more similar are the two rPE surfaces being compared.

Discussion
Choosing the Theory Level
for Computing Surfaces
Because
of the number of calculations needed to compute the rPE surfaces herein,
the first task was to identify the theory to be used in the two-torsion
constraint optimizations. To this end, full optimizations were performed
using the following theory levels: HF/6-31G(d), MP2/VTZ, MP2/aVTZ,
MP2/VQZ, MP2/aVQZ, and MP2/aV5Z. For target values, experimental geometries
are only available for methanol (t)20,32−37 and ethanol (t),8,24,38 whereas coupled cluster geometries are available for methanol (t),
ethanol (t), propan-2-ol (g−), and propanol (Tt) (see Supporting Information Tables 1 and 2).5,39 First, let us consider the performance of MP2/aV5Z.

On average,
MP2/aV5Z underestimates the experimental bond lengths and angles—with
respect to experimental data averages—of methanol and ethanol
by 0.006 Å and 0.15°. In comparison to the best coupled
cluster data, MP2/aV5Z on average overestimates bond lengths by 0.002
Å, underestimates angles by 0.15°, and underestimates torsions
by 0.8°. In addition to internal coordinates, one can also compare
rotational constants for gauging accuracy. Because MP2/aVTZ was the
most rigorous theory level used for frequency analyses, its resulting
rotational constants can be compared to experimental microwave values.
As seen in Table 1,
the theoretical rotational constants agree very well with experimental
values, with an average percent error of 0.75%. In fact, this theory
level outperforms values determined using coupled cluster theory with
large basis sets, which resulted on average in twice as much error
(i.e., 1.50%). Unfortunately, computing rotational constants through
an MP2/aV5Z vibrational analysis was impossible using our available
resources. Consequently, we make the assumption that increasing the
basis size to aV5Z will not significantly alter the resulting optimized
geometries, which is supported by the below paragraph. Because MP2/aV5Z
is also the most robust (i.e., the best representation of orbital
space) theory used for fully optimized conformations investigated
herein, we subsequently used its structures as our benchmark targets.

Although tempting because of its low computational cost, HF/6-31G(d)
clearly performs the worst at reproducing MP2/aV5Z geometries with
an overall average RMSD of 0.019 Å (Table 2). The MP2 optimizations using the Dunning-style
basis sets increasingly showed convergence toward the MP2/aV5Z geometries,
as expected. Ultimately, the MP2/aVTZ theory was chosen for generating
the rPE surfaces since it consistently gave RMSD values close to 0.004
Å. MP2/VTZ was not chosen, even though it had favorable average
RMSDs of 0.004–0.006 Å across all molecules because individual
stationary points had RMSD values up to 0.015 Å (e.g., propanol’s
G+g+ (‡: −CH3) in Supporting Information Table 5). The VQZ, aVQZ, and aV5Z basis sets were
deemed too expensive for the slight improvements made in their RMSD
values. The choice of MP2/aVTZ for constraint optimizations is further
supported by the fact that propanol’s CCSD(T)/aVTZ//MP2/aVTZ
and CCSD(T)/aVTZ//MP2/aV5Z rPEs are equivalent to within 0.002 kcal·mol–1 (see Supporting Information Table 6).

MP2.5 Performance
In our previous
study of octane and
smaller unbranched hydrocarbons,30 dispersion
forces were a significant component to conformational rPEs. In that
study, we found that MP2.5/aVTZ provided an rPE comparable to the
more expensive CCSD(T)/aVTZ and outperforms MP2 (see Table 7). Extending that comparison,
the performance of MP2.5 was evaluated for small alcohols, whose conformational
stability is dependent upon forces greater than dispersion. On average,
the MP2.5/aVTZ rPEs are very close to those determined by CCSD(T)
theory that employs triple zeta or larger basis sets on well-optimized
geometries (Table 7). Computing the average absolute error over all fully optimized
conformations listed in Tables 3–6 (i.e., 31 conformations,
excluding the global minima) with respect to the best CCSD(T) theory
computed, yields a value of 0.080 kcal·mol–1 for MP2.5/aVTZ. Interestingly, computing the MP2.5/VTZ rPE results
in an average absolute error of 0.134 kcal·mol–1. This shows the importance of including augmented basis functions
into the energy calculations.

For comparison to MP2, the average
absolute error for MP2/aV5Z is 0.164 kcal·mol–1. Thus, for small alcohols on average, MP2.5/aVTZ provides rPEs that
are closer to CCSD(T) values than MP2 calculations alone. However,
the performance of MP2.5 is dependent upon the individual conformations,
as seen for a wide variety of propanol’s conformations (Table 6). For example, the
rPE for the Cg+ (‡: CCCO) conformation becomes significantly
worse when computed using aVTZ (i.e., 0.236 kcal·mol–1) versus the smaller VTZ (i.e., 0.040 kcal·mol–1) basis set.

Specific Aspects for the Examined Molecules
Methanol
Being overall one of the smallest molecules,
methanol has been well-studied by theoretical approaches. The hydroxyl
rotation barrier has been established to be between 0.999 and 1.099
kcal·mol–1 using CCSD(T) and focal point calculations
(Table 3),17−19 which compares well with the experimental value of 1.07 kcal·mol–1.20 To the existing computational
data, we contribute MP2.5 and CCSD(T)/CBS energies (Table 3). The best CCSD(T)/CBS barrier
height was extrapolated using the data obtained from the aVTZ and
aVQZ basis sets—resulting in a barrier of 1.021 kcal·mol–1, which agrees well with the experimental value. With
respect to the CCSD(T)/CBS[aVTZ, aVQZ] results, the MP2.5 barrier
heights that were computed using nonaugmented basis sets (i.e., VTZ
and VQZ) were consistently overestimated (i.e., rPE range of 1.039–1.115
kcal·mol–1), whereas those computed using augmented
basis sets (i.e., aVTZ, aVQZ, and aV5Z) underestimated the barrier
(i.e., rPE range of 0.983–1.011 kcal·mol–1).

Ethanol
Ethanol also has a long history of being investigated
by both experimental and theoretical means. It has three minima [i.e.,
(+/−)-gauche, trans] and three first-order saddle points [i.e.,
(+/−)-eclipse, cis] about the CCOH torsion rotation (Supporting Information Figure 3). Previously,
the most accurate results for ethanol’s stationary points were
computed by CCSD(T)/aVTZ//MP2/aVTZ,21 and
involved four of the possible six stationary points. The trans conformation
was predicted to be 0.124 kcal·mol–1 more stable
than the (+/−)-gauche conformations, slightly overestimating
the experimental values that range from 0.118 to 0.120 kcal·mol–1.8,23 Concerning the hydroxyl rotational
barrier, the (+/−)-eclipse and cis conformations were predicted
to be 0.939 and 1.211 kcal·mol–1 relative to
the trans conformation, which are comparable to the experimental values
of 1.15 and 1.26 kcal·mol–1.23 Note that the value of 1.26 kcal·mol–1 was computed using experimental data (see Table 4 footnote g). Increasing the theory level
to CCSD(T)/aVQZ//MP2/aV5Z, as reported herein, did not significantly
alter the stability of these stationary points (i.e., 0.128, 1.095,
and 1.209 kcal·mol–1, Table 4).

In addition to the above six stationary
points, there are three more energetically unique first-order saddle
points that arise from the methyl rotation [i.e., t (‡: −CH3) and (+/−)-gauche (‡: −CH3)], whose relative barrier heights are experimentally known. To compare
these values, we make the assumption that the spectroscopic values
are always relative to the local minimum [i.e., to the trans or (+/−)-gauche
conformation] and not only to the global minimum. Therefore, the methyl
rotational barriers given in Table 4 should be adjusted by the minimum along the CCOH torsion
coordinate, yielding rPE barriers of 3.114 kcal·mol–1 for trans (‡: −CH3) and 3.400 kcal·mol–1 (i.e., 3.528–0.128 kcal·mol–1) for (+/−)-gauche (‡: −CH3). These
barriers agree well with the experimental values of 3.31–3.55
kcal·mol–1 for trans (‡: −CH3)8,23−26 and 3.58–3.805 kcal·mol–1 for (+/−)-gauche (‡: −CH3).8,23,26

Ethanol
is the smallest alcohol that possesses a coupling between
two distinct torsions (i.e., HCCO and CCOH). Previous experimental
studies showed that the first-order saddle point barrier heights are
dependent upon the hydroxyl group adopting a trans or gauche minimum,
with trans providing the lower barrier.8,23,25,26 We extend this observation
by investigating the dependency of the second-order saddle point barriers
on the hydroxyl conformation. As seen in Figure 3 and Supporting Information Table 7, the relative barriers of the second-order saddle points
(i.e., for when HCCO = 0°) are also dependent upon the conformations
adopted by the CCOH torsion. Thus, the conformations that display
the lowest to highest methyl rotation barrier, relative to the global
trans minimum are  

Propan-2-ol
In terms of the spatial
arrangement of
atoms and intramolecular coordinates, propan-2-ol is very similar
to ethanol, but differs by the presence of a symmetrically equivalent
methyl group. Consequently, the hydroxyl rotation is a function of
two CCOH torsions and a single HCCO, and can be influenced by the
rotation of both methyl groups. The most comprehensive conformational
study to date, by Dobrowolski and co-workers, identified two minima,
four first-order saddle points, two second-order saddle points, and
one third-order saddle point via MP2/VTZ optimizations.40 Kahn and Kahn focal point calculations on both
minima and three first-order saddle points represent the most rigorous
rPE calculations to date.22 Collectively,
both studies identified all of the minima and first-order saddle points
on propan-2-ol’s potential energy surface. Adding to this data,
we compute all of the minima and first-order saddle points using a
single theory level [i.e., CCSD(T)], compute the rPE surface that
is formed by the coupling of HCCO and CCOH torsions, and subsequently
identify second-order saddle points.

Propan-2-ol has three minima
[i.e., (+/−)-gauche and trans] that are defined by its hydroxyl
orientation (Figure 1).10,22,28,41,42 The best focal point
calculation predicted the (+/−)-gauche to be 0.268 kcal·mol–1 more stable than the trans conformation,22 for which CCSD(T) is in close agreement (0.257
kcal·mol–1, Table 5). These computed values lie in the middle
of the experimental range of 0.025–0.450 kcal·mol–1.12,41,43

Along the CCOH internal coordinate pathway, there exist three
first-order
saddle points [i.e. e(+/−), (‡: CCOH), and c (‡:
CCOH)] (Figure 1).
The cis saddle point, connecting the two gauche conformations, has
a barrier of 1.318 and 1.274 kcal·mol–1 according
to focal point22 and CCSD(T) calculations.
Similarly, the (+/−)-eclipse saddle points, connecting the
(+/−)-gauche and trans conformations, have a focal point and
CCSD(T) barrier of 1.14322 and 1.142 kcal·mol–1, which are notably lower than the experimental value
of 1.68 kcal·mol–1.10 Note that the focal point papers reference experimental values of
1.54 and 1.24 kcal·mol–1 for the two hydroxyl
rotation barriers,22,28 citing microwave spectroscopy
studies.44,45 However, we were unable to verify these
two values from the original source.

The remaining three energetically
unique saddle points correspond
to the rotation of one methyl group with respect to the three possible
hydroxyl minima [i.e., g+ (‡: −CH3 a), g–
(‡: −CH3 a), and t (‡: −CH3 a)]. These saddle points also have their own isomers that
occur when the second methyl group (i.e., −CH3 b)
rotates instead. Note that the (+)-gauche and (−)-gauche conformations
are not equivalent because they have different orientations with respect
to the rotating methyl group (see Figure 1). As seen in ethanol and based on the rPE
that references the global minimum (Table 5), the methyl rotation barrier is dependent
upon the orientation of the hydroxyl group. The conformations that
display the lowest to highest methyl rotation barrier, relative to
the global (+/−)-gauche minima are  

Adjusting the methyl rotational barriers
that are given in Table 5 by the rPE of their
respective local minimum results in CCSD(T) energies of 3.148, 3.482,
and 3.471 kcal·mol–1 when the molecule adopts
(+)-gauche, (−)-gauche, and trans conformations, respectively.
There remains a clear differentiation between the methyl rotation
for the (+)-gauche and (−)-gauche conformations as well as
for the (+)-gauche and trans conformations. However, the methyl rotation
barriers for (−)-gauche and trans become nearly equivalent
(i.e., a 0.011 kcal·mol–1 difference). For
comparison to previous work, only one of the gauche barriers was computed
using focal point calculations—yielding a value of 3.189 kcal·mol–1.22 On the basis of its
magnitude, it is assumed that this value is for the (+)-gauche conformation
[i.e., g+ (‡ −CH3 a)].

Qualitatively,
the ethanol’s (Figure 3) and propan-2-ol’s (Supporting Information Figure 2) surfaces formed by the HCCO
and CCOH couplings are nearly identical. In an attempt to quantify
the overall repulsiveness of surfaces involving the methyl rotation
by a single metric, an average rPE for each surface was computed to
be 2.262 and 2.309 kcal·mol–1 (Table 8). A difference between the
resulting averaged rPEs provides a relative scale for identifying
if one surface is more or less repulsive than another. This difference
shows that the rPE of the propan-2-ol and ethanol surfaces are, on
average, within 0.047 kcal·mol–1 of each other.
Furthermore, a similarity index was computed between the two surfaces
(Table 8), resulting
in a value of 0.98. Both of these approaches confirm that propan-2-ol’s
and ethanol’s methyl rotation surfaces are essentially identical.

Propanol
Propanol, because of its additional carbene
group (i.e., −CH2−), has five potential energy
surfaces (Figures 4 and 5) that can be described by the coupling of(a) the CCCO
and CCOH torsions,

(b) the methyl rotation and CCCO, with
CCOH adopting a trans conformation,

(c) the methyl rotation and CCCO, with
CCOH adopting a (+/−)-gauche conformation,

(d) the methyl rotation and CCOH, with
CCCO adopting a trans conformation and

(e) the methyl rotation and CCOH, with
CCCO adopting a (+/−)-gauche conformation.

for all propanol surfaces computed (see also Figure 5). The CCSD(T)/aVTZ energies are given in Supporting Information Table 9.

kcal·mol–1 bins, which ranges from the global
minimum to the global maximum for all propanol surfaces computed.
The CCSD(T) energies are given in Supporting Information Tables 10–13.

The first three surfaces are formed by rotating around adjacent
torsion angles, whereas the last two are defined by torsions that
are separated by one bond. Through the overall generation of these
surfaces, all of propanol’s minima, first-order, and second-order
saddle points could be characterized at the CCSD(T) theory level.
Note that these surfaces overlap to some extent because certain conformations
or their isomers are represented multiple times (e.g., Tg+ and G+t/G–t).

The most complex and varied surface is formed by the CCCO and CCOH
torsions (Figure 4).
Apart from the stationary points sampled during methyl rotation, this
surface displays all of propanol’s minima, first-order, and
second-order saddle points. The surface is symmetric about CCCO’s
180°—considering the whole surface (i.e., CCCO = 0–330°),
a total of nine minima, eighteen first-order and nine second-order
saddle points exist Out of the nine minima, eight exist as enantiomeric
pairs and one (i.e., Tt) is an energetically unique minima (Table 6). The experimental
information regarding the relative stability of propanol’s
minima is unclear because of vague identifications and contradictions
within the literature.13,14,46,47 However, focal point calculations clearly
predicted the rPE ordering of the minima, with the G+t and G–t
enantiomeric pair being the global minima.27,28 According to the focal point and CCSD(T) calculations, the remaining
minima (i.e., G+g+, G–g–, G+g–, G–g+,
Tg+, Tg–, and Tt) are within a small energetic range of 0.11–0.13
kcal·mol–1 of the global minima (Table 6).

Previously, the most
comprehensive study of the minima and first-order
saddle points was performed using the MP2/aVTZ//MP2/VDZ theory level
by Kahn and Bruice,27 but excluded six
first-order saddle points (see Table 6). The first-order saddle points with the largest rotational
barrier, relative to the global minima, have the CCCO torsion adopting
a cis conformation (i.e., Cg+, Cg–, and Ct) with essentially
equivalent barriers of 5.004 and 5.034 kcal·mol–1 (Table 6). These
barriers connect the (+)-gauche and (−)-gauche CCCO conformational
minima (i.e., G+g+, G–g–, G+g–, G–g+,
G+t, and G–t). The next largest barrier occurs when the CCCO
torsion adopts a (+/−)-eclipse conformation (i.e., E+g+, E–g–,
E+t, E–t, E+g–, and E–g+), with energies that
range from 3.353 to 3.806 kcal·mol–1 that connect
the (+/−)-gauche (i.e., G+g+, G–g–, G+g–,
G–g+, G+t, and G–t) and trans conformational minima
(i.e., Tg+, Tg–, and Tt).

Along the CCOH coordinate,
the first-order saddle points that have
the lowest rotational barriers are when the CCOH torsion adopts a
(+/−)-eclipse (i.e., G+e–, G–e+, G+e+, and G–e−)
conformation, with energies ranging from 0.830 to 1.065 kcal·mol–1. Occurring at slightly higher barriers are the CCOH
torsions that adopt a cis conformation (i.e., G+c, G–c, and
Tc), with energies of 1.211 and 1.556 kcal·mol–1. All of the second-order saddle points that are defined by the CCCO
and CCOH torsions (i.e., Ce+, Ce–, Cc, E+c, E+e+, E+e–,
E–e+, E–e–, and E–c) have relative energies
that range between 4.555 and 6.467 kcal·mol–1 (Supporting Information Table 9), with
the least stable conformation having both torsion angles adopt a cis
conformation (i.e., Cc). Given a limited amount of absorbed energy,
the CCCO conversion from (+/−)-gauche to trans would preferentially
go through the eclipsed first-order saddle points rather than the
cis saddle point.

Regarding the methyl rotation, the surfaces
formed by the coupling
between the adjacent HCCC and CCCO torsions display little dependency
upon the conformations that the hydroxyl group adopts (Figure 5c,d, and Supporting Information Tables 12 and 13). The average CCSD(T)/aVTZ
rPE of each of these surfaces is 3.450 and 3.510 kcal·mol–1, a 0.189 kcal·mol–1 difference
between them; computing the similarity between these two surfaces
results in a value of 0.95. Both of these metrics support the observation
that the two surfaces are similar.

Ordering the conformations
such that they display the lowest to
highest methyl rotational barriers (Table 6), relative to the global minimum, leads
to  

Notice that all of these barriers are
lower than those seen in
ethanol and propan-2-ol, whose lowest barrier was 3.134 kcal·mol–1. Adjusting these barriers by their local minimum
(i.e., G+t, G–t, G+g+, G–g+, Tt, and Tg+) results in
energies that range from 2.597 to 2.769 kcal·mol–1. Thus, all nine methyl rotor barrier heights occur within a narrow
0.172 kcal·mol–1 window of one another. Consequently,
their individual identification might be difficult to achieve spectroscopically.
This also further supports the observation that the hydroxyl orientation
has only a small effect on the methyl rotation. Experimentally, the
methyl barrier dependency upon the CCCO and CCOH torsions has been
investigated, but the literature is unclear with regard to the specific
conformations studied.13,46 What can be definitively stated
is that the experimental work finds that the methyl barrier ranges
from 2.620 ± 0.050 to 3.080 ± 0.050 kcal·mol–1,13,14,46 with the lower
values agreeing well with the CCSD(T) values.

A comparison of
the methyl rotational surfaces, as defined between
the CCOH and HCCn (where n = C or O) torsions, can be made for ethanol,
propan-2-ol, (+/−)-gauche propanol, and trans propanol (Figures 3, 5a,b and Supporting Information Figure
2). The (+/−)-gauche and trans propanol rPE surfaces are less
repulsive than those for ethanol and propan-2-ol, with average surface
rPEs of 1.913 and 1.889 kcal·mol–1 (Table 8). This reduced repulsion
can be attributed to the longer distance between the terminal methyl
and hydroxyl groups because of the additional carbene group that is
present. The differences between the propanol surfaces and those of
ethanol and propan-2-ol are further exemplified by their low similarity
indexes, with values that range from 0.80 to 0.83. However, note that
the (+/−)-gauche and trans propanol surfaces are themselves
similar, with a difference in their average surface rPEs of 0.024
kcal·mol–1 and a similarity index of 0.98.

Conclusions
In this paper, we present an extensive
investigation of the minima
and first-order saddle points for methanol, ethanol, propan-2-ol,
and propanol. All geometries were fully optimized at the MP2/aV5Z
theory level, whereas the rPEs were computed using CCSD(T). For the
first time, we identify all minima and first-order saddle points for
ethanol, propan-2-ol, and propanol within a consistent theoretical
framework. Frequency analyses were performed at the MP2/aVTZ//MP2/aVTZ
theory level to verify the fully optimized stationary point positions
on their potential energy surfaces. A comparison of rotational constants
to experimentally known values showed that geometries optimized using
MP2/aVTZ were reliable. Furthermore, seven rPE surfaces were computed
at the CCSD(T)/aVTZ//MP2/aVTZ theory level. These surfaces subsequently
allowed us to identify second-order saddle points.

Building
on previous results for linear-saturated hydrocarbons,30 we investigated how well MP2.5 performs at reproducing
CCSD(T) relative energies for small alcohols. In general, MP2.5 provides
rPEs that are close to the best CCSD(T) values computed using reliable
small alcohol geometries. Specifically, MP2.5/aVTZ//MP2/aV5Z had an
average error of 0.081 kcal·mol–1 with respect
to CCSD(T)/aVTZ//MP2/aV5Z rPEs. However, MP2.5 rPEs can deviate significantly
from the CCSD(T) values, as seen for several individual propanol conformations—this
being especially true when used in conjunction with the smaller VTZ
basis set.

Several general observations can be made from the
data presented
herein. As anticipated, methyl rotation is most affected by the conformations
that are adopted by adjacent torsion angles. This was demonstrated
by the comparison of the rPE surfaces formed by the coupling between
HCCn (where n = O or C) and the CCOH torsion in ethane and propane.

The first-order saddle points for methyl rotation in ethanol and
propan-2-ol show a clear energetic dependency and separation upon
the hydroxyl orientation when the rPEs are computed in reference to
each of the molecules’ global minimum. However, if the rPEs
are adjusted by their local minimum, the methyl barriers for propan-2-ol’s
(−)-gauche and trans conformations become equivalent.

The rPE surfaces of ethanol and propan-2-ol formed by the coupling
of HCCO and CCOH torsions are nearly identical, displaying average
rPEs of 2.262 and 2.309 kcal·mol–1 (Δ
= 0.047 kcal·mol–1) and a similarity index
of 0.98. These surfaces are significantly different from propanol’s
two comparable surfaces that are formed by HCCC and CCOH, exemplified
by similarity indexes that range from 0.80 to 0.83. Note that these
two propanol surfaces are themselves highly similar, with average
rPEs of 1.913 and 1.889 kcal·mol–1 and a similarity
index of 0.98.

Likewise, the two propanol surfaces formed by
the coupling of HCCC
and CCCO are also highly similar, with a similarity index of 0.95.
The average rPEs of the two surfaces are larger than those mentioned
above, with values of 3.450 and 3.510 kcal·mol–1. Furthermore, all of propanol’s methyl rotational barriers
are energetically lower than those found in ethanol and propan-2-ol,
whereas methanol possesses the lowest barrier of all those studied.
Finally, because of its additional carbene group, propanol possesses
the largest number of minima and first-order saddle points of the
molecules studied. A total of thirty-six stationary points were fully
optimized and characterized.

It would also be possible to alternatively
use Jensen basis sets48−50 in the calculations, which might reduce the calculation
cost. These
basis sets were originally designed for use in Hartree–Fock
and density functional theories. There have been two studies that
discuss their usage in MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations,51,52 showing a somewhat mixed result that depends on the system being
investigated (i.e., isolated molecules vs weakly bound clusters).
We intend to investigate this further in the near future.

Methodology
Fully relaxed density-fitted (DF)53−55 HF/6-31G(d) and MP256 optimizations were performed on all minima and
first-order saddle points until a maximum force of 1.5 × 10–5, RMS force of 1.0 × 10–5,
maximum displacement of 6.0 × 10–5, and RMS
displacement of 4.0 × 10–5 (i.e., a tight convergence)
were achieved. The DF-MP2 optimization employed 6-31G(d), cc-pVTZ
(VTZ), aug-cc-pVTZ (aVTZ), cc-pVQZ (VQZ), aug-cc-pVQZ (aVQZ), and
aug-cc-pV5Z (aV5Z) basis sets.57−60 As part of the DF-MP2 calculations, the self-consistent
field reference energies were also computed using the DF approximation
with the appropriate corresponding auxiliary basis sets.61−63 All optimizations were performed using C1 molecular symmetry, whereas the symmetry groups reported in the
tables were obtained through an analysis of the fully optimized geometries
using the Symmetrizer program.64 A frequency
analysis was performed at the MP2/aVTZ//MP2/aVTZ theory level for
each minimum and first-order saddle point. Second-order saddle points
were identified based on their position on the computed rPE surfaces.

The rPEs were computed at MP2.565,66 and CCSD(T)67−69 theory levels by performing a single self-consistent field evaluation
upon the fully optimized geometries. Extrapolations to the complete-basis-set
(CBS) limit were done using the two-point scheme of Helgaker and co-workers;70 the two basis sets used in the extrapolation
are presented within square brackets. For the generation of the rPE
surfaces, all geometry optimizations were done using traditional MP2
calculations (i.e., without DF approximation). Because of its prevalent
use and discussion, the CCSD(T)/aVTZ//MP2/aVTZ theory level will be
abbreviated simply as CCSD(T). In all correlated calculations, the
core orbitals were frozen. All constraint optimizations associated
with rPE surfaces were computed using the Gamess program (v. 1 MAY
2013 (R1)).71,72 All other calculations were performed
using the Psi4 program (v. 1.1a2.dev170).73,74

For unique identification of each conformation, we make use
of
the previously established nomenclature.47,75Table 9 provides
the full nomenclature, including associated angle ranges used to classify
the conformations. The conformations adopted by the hydroxyl rotation
are abbreviated using a lower case letter, whereas those adopted by
propanol’s CCCO torsion are abbreviated using an upper case
letter.47 The direction of torsion rotation
is indicated by + and – symbols.75 The first-order saddle points are indicated using a ‡ symbol
and accompanied by the torsion’s atomic sequence that characterizes
the transition state (e.g., ‡: CCOH).
