The studies of nanostructure-based
aluminum sensors have attracted
huge attention because aluminum is a more cost-effective plasmonic
material. However, the intrinsic properties of the aluminum metal,
having a large imaginary part of the dielectric function and a longer
electromagnetic field decay length and problems of poor long-term
chemical stability, limit the surface-sensing capability and applicability
of nanostructures. We propose the combination of capped aluminum nanoslits
and a thin-capped dielectric layer to overcome these limitations.
We show that the dielectric layer can positively enhance the wavelength
sensitivities of the Wood’s anomaly-dominant resonance and
asymmetric Fano resonance in capped aluminum nanoslits. The maximum
improvement can be reached by a factor of 3.5. Besides, there is an
optimal layer thickness for the surface sensitivity because of the
trade-off relationship between the refractive index sensitivity and
decay length. We attribute the enhanced surface sensitivity to a reduced
evanescent length, which is confirmed by the finite difference time-domain
calculations. The protein–protein interaction experiments verify
the high-surface sensitivity of the structures, and a limit of quantification
(LOQ) of 1 pg/mL anti-bovine serum albumin is achieved. Such low-cost,
highly sensitive aluminum-based nanostructures can benefit various
sensing applications.

1 Introduction
Nanostructure-based surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing has
the features of sensitive, real-time, and label-free detection and
is applied to many applications, such as environmental monitoring,
medical diagnostics, and food safety.1−4 Compared to the commercial prism-based SPR
sensors, nanostructure-based SPR sensors provide a simple way for
SPR excitation and have some benefits, including small detection volume,
simple measurement, and ease of multiple detections.5−11 Noble metals such as Au and Ag are commonly used for the majority
of the plasmonic sensors because these materials have low optical
losses in the visible and near-infrared ranges. Recently, the studies
of nanostructure-based aluminum sensors have attracted a lot of attention
because aluminum is a cost-effective plasmonic material and useful
for short-wavelength surface plasmons. Various aluminum-based nanostructures
such as nanoconcave arrays,12 nanoholes,13−15 triangular nanoparticles,16 and capped
nanoslits17 have been proposed. To use
the Al material for sensing, the problems of poor long-term chemical
stability have to be solved. These issues can be addressed by depositing
a passivation dielectric film or using a passivation treatment based
on oxygen plasma to produce an oxide-protecting layer.18 However, the large imaginary part of the dielectric
function for aluminum results in a broad resonance response and a
longer electromagnetic field decay length, which limits its surface-sensing
capability. Therefore, improving surface sensitivities of aluminum-based
nanostructures is an important issue.

To evaluate the surface-sensing
capabilities of different nanostructures,
the effective refractive index (neff)
due to the immobilized biolayer is approximated as follows19 1  where d is the biolayer thickness, ns is the
bulk solution refractive index, na is
the adsorbate monolayer refractive index,
and ld is the length of the surface evanescent
field. The wavelength shift (Δλ) caused by the biolayer
can be expressed as19 2  where Sλ is the bulk (refractive index) sensitivity, defined
as Δλ/Δns. The surface
sensitivity is related to the
bulk sensitivity, refractive index difference between the adsorbate
monolayer and the surrounding environment, and evanescent decay length.
To improve the sensing capabilities of SPR sensors, many approaches,
such as the spectral integration analysis,20−23 thermal-annealing nanoimprint
method,24−27 Fano coupling,28−32 narrowing resonance bandwidth with oblique angle incidence,33 magneto-optic SPR sensors,34−37 and nearly guided-wave SPR sensors,38 were proposed. The spectral integration analysis
considers wavelength shifts and intensity changes near the resonances,
which is able to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the system and
enhance the sensing capability.21−24 To increase the resonant slope, Fano resonances in
nanostructures are proposed. The Fano resonance exhibits a distinctly
asymmetric shape, which arises from the spectral overlap between a
narrow discrete resonance and a broad resonance.30 The Fano resonances have been extensively studied in various
nanoparticles,39 plasmonic nanostructures,9,31 and metamaterials.40 To reduce the evanescent
decay length, a nearly guided wave SPR sensor, a thin silicon top
layer on the SPR sensor, is proposed. This structure enables the surface
plasmons to spread along the dielectric layer and increases the interaction
volume, which improves the sensitivity by a factor of 4.41

In this study, we proposed the combination
of Fano resonances in
capped nanoslits and a thin capped dielectric layer to improve the
surface sensitivities of aluminum-based nanostructures (see Figure 1a). The thin dielectric
layer changes the resonance field distribution, reduces the decay
length, increases the interaction volume, and improves the surface
sensitivity. We utilized hot embossing nanoimprint lithography, thermal
evaporation, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) to fabricate low-cost,
large-area, and highly sensitive alumina-/aluminum-capped nanoslit
arrays on plastic films. The optical properties of these aluminum
nanostructures with different resonance profiles and dielectric layer
thicknesses were studied; their surface sensitivities were compared
using wavelength interrogation. Moreover, the sensing capabilities
of the proposed nanostructures were verified by measuring the protein–protein
interactions between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and anti-BSA. We showed
that the capped dielectric layer can enhance the surface sensitivities
of the Wood’s anomaly-dominant resonance and asymmetric Fano
resonance in capped aluminum nanoslits. The maximum improvement can
be reached by a factor of 3.5. Although the dielectric layer reduced
the bulk refractive index sensitivity, the surface sensitivity was
improved because of the reduced decay length, which was confirmed
by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. Besides,
there was an optimal dielectric layer thickness for the surface sensitivity
because of the trade-off relationship between the refractive index
sensitivity and decay length. The protein–protein interaction
experiments verified the high sensitivity of the alumina-/aluminum-capped
nanostructures, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 pg/mL anti-BSA
was achieved.

42 nm (c), W = 60 nm, P = 470 nm,
and t = 0 nm for the structures.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optical
Properties of the Capped Aluminum
Nanoslits
Figure 1a shows a schematic configuration depicting the geometrical
parameters of the capped aluminum nanoslits and the direction of the
transverse magnetic (TM)-polarized incident light. Figure 1b,c shows the measured transmission
spectra of the 470 nm period capped aluminum nanoslits with different
heights of metal films in air and water for normally incident TM-polarized
light. We chose H (slit height)
= 60 nm, T (Al thickness) = 22 and
42 nm, W (slit width) = 60 nm, P (period) = 470 nm, and t (Al2O3 film thickness) = 0 nm for the structures.
For T = 42 nm nanostructure, there are transmission
peaks and dips in the spectrum because of the couplings of cavity
resonances in nanoslits and surface waves on both sides of the periodic
aluminum surface (the aluminum/medium and aluminum/substrate interfaces).
The gap plasmons transmit through the nanoslits and the capping layer,
leading to a broadband transmission within a cavity spectrum. The
resonance condition can be estimated using a Fabry–Perot cavity.42 The resonance wavelength is related to the gap
width and cavity length. The cavity mode is coupled to the surface
waves from the edges of the top and bottom interfaces and coupled
to the Bloch wave surface plasmon polariton (BW-SPP). The BW-SPP occurs
when the Bragg condition is satisfied. The Bragg condition for one-dimensional
arrays can be described by1 3  where i is the resonance
order, P is the period of the nanostructure, and n is environmental refractive index. The interaction between
cavity resonances in nanoslits (a continuum state) and BW-SPPs (a
discrete resonance state) creates a Fano resonance profile consisting
of a minimum (dip) and an adjacent maximum (peak).29,43,44 It generates a sharp resonance profile.
In the case of capped nanoslit arrays with a 470 nm period and a 42
nm thick metal film, extremely sharp Fano resonances were observed.
The resonance dip wavelengths of Fano resonances at the air/aluminum,
water/aluminum, and substrate/aluminum interfaces were 481, 636, and
757 nm, respectively. On the other hand, for T =
22 nm thick nanostructure, the metal film was too thin to form a continuous
film on 60 nm high nanoslits. The direct transmission through the
metal film and Wood’s anomaly contributes to the transmission
spectrum. The redistribution of diffracted photons results in the
Wood’s anomaly, and a transmission peak appears under the condition 4  

The measured resonance peak wavelengths
at the air/aluminum, water/aluminum, and substrate/aluminum interfaces
were 473, 625, and 739 nm, respectively. These values are quite consistent
with the theoretical predictions, that is, 470 (air, n = 1), 625.1 (water, n = 1.33), and 737.9 (substrate, n = 1.58).

We further utilized FDTD (FullWAVE 4.0,
RSoft) simulations to verify
the measured spectra and the decay lengths for the resonance at peak
and dip wavelengths. Figure 2a shows the calculated transmission spectra of the 470 nm
period capped aluminum nanoslits with different structure parameters
for normally incident TM-polarized light. The structure parameters
were P = 470 nm, H = 60 nm, T = 20–40 nm, W = 60 nm, and t = 0 nm. The resonances with different resonance profiles
were observed in the calculated spectra. These resonance profiles
match quite well with the measured results, as shown in Figure 1b,c. Figure 2b–d shows the resonance field (Ez) distributions for the resonance
peaks (P1 and P2) and dip (D2), respectively. Obviously, the Fano
resonance dip (D2) has a shorter decay length than the Fano resonance
peak (P2) or the Wood’s peak (P1). The calculated decay lengths
were 883, 891, and 338 nm for P1, P2, and D2, respectively. These
results indicate that the Fano resonance dip has a higher surface
sensitivity than other resonance peaks. However, these peaks show
sharper resonance profiles than the Fano dip as shown in the experimental
results. The bandwidth of the peak resonance is 3.4 times narrower
than that of the Fano dip, as shown in Figure 1c. The resonant peak has a better resolution
for wavelength and intensity measurement because of its sharp slope.
We found that the use of a thin-capped dielectric layer can greatly
reduce the decay lengths and enhance the surface sensitivities of
these resonance peaks.

resonances

transmission spectra of the 470 nm period capped aluminum nanoslits

(d), respectively. The Fano resonance dip (D2) has a shorter decay
length than the Fano resonance peak (P2) or the Wood’s peak
(P1). The calculated decay lengths were 883, 891, and 338 nm for P1,
P2, and D2, respectively.

2.2 Surface and Refractive Index Sensitivity Tests
for Alumina-/Aluminum-Capped Nanoslits
We study the effect
of the dielectric layer on the surface sensitivities of the nanostructures
by depositing different thicknesses (t) of Al2O3 films. We prepared some alumina-/aluminum-capped
nanoslits and recorded their transmission spectra. The thickness of
Al2O3 dielectric films ranged 0–64 nm.
After an 8 nm thick Al2O3 film was deposited
on the structures, the spectra were recorded again. Figure 3a,b shows the spectrum of nanostructures
with metal thicknesses of 20 nm (Wood’s anomaly-dominant) and
50 nm (Fano resonance-dominant) for different Al2O3 film thicknesses, respectively. The resonance peaks and the
dip were red-shifted when Al2O3 film was deposited
on the structures. The measured wavelength shifts for the resonance
peaks and dip are shown in Figure 3c. Without dielectric layers, the shifts were 4.4 and
2.3 and 6.6 nm for T = 20 nm and T = 50 nm nanostructures, respectively. The resonance dip has a higher
sensitivity than the resonance peaks because of its shorter decay
length. The spectral shifts gradually increased and reached their
maximum when the alumina layers reached about 32–48 nm. The
maximal shifts were 9.2 and 10.7 nm for T = 20 nm
and T = 50 nm thick nanostructures, respectively.
When the dielectric layers further increased, the shifts decreased.
Compared to the sensor without the dielectric layer, the nanostructures
with dielectric layers had higher sensitivities. The spectral shift
was improved by a factor of 2 for 20 nm thick nanostructures. For
50 nm thick sensors, the shifts increased by factors of 3.5 and 1.6
for the resonance peak and dip, respectively (see Figure 3d). We estimated the surface
sensitivities of the 50 nm thick nanostructures with 30 nm thick dielectric
layers by calculating the wavelength shifts caused by the 30 nm thick
Al2O3 films. They ranged from 1.6 to 1.8 nm/nm.
With 0.1 nm wavelength resolution, the capped aluminum nanoslits can
detect about 0.05 nm thick biolayer films on the surface.

nanoslits using wavelength interrogation. The transmission spectra

shift against the dielectric layer thickness for different aluminum
nanostructures. The peak or dip wavelength shift of bare aluminum
nanostructures was chosen as a reference. (e,f) Transmission spectra
of the capped aluminum nanoslits without dielectric layers (e) and
with a 32 nm thick Al2O3 film (f) in various
water/glycerin mixtures. The slopes of the fitting curves show that
the bulk sensitivities were 471 and 404 nm/RIU.

According to eq 2,
when the film thickness (d), the bulk solution refractive
index (ns), and the refractive index of
the thin film (na) are chosen, the spectral
shift is determined by the bulk sensitivity (Sλ) and decay length (ld).
To confirm the effect of the dielectric layer on the refractive index
sensitivity, we measured the refractive index sensitivities of 50
nm thick-capped nanoslits without and with a 30 nm thick alumina layer,
as shown in Figure 3e,f. The results show that the bulk sensitivities were 471 and 404
nm/RIU, respectively. This indicates that the dielectric layer not
only reduces the decay length but also decreases the bulk sensitivity.
There is a trade-off between Sλ and ld. The optimal condition for dielectric-coating
thickness occurs at t = 30–50 nm. In the optimal
case, the surface wavelength sensitivity for the alumina-/aluminum-capped
nanostructures was increased up to three times. We attributed the
improved wavelength sensitivity to the reduced decay length caused
by the capped dielectric layer. When the dielectric layer is deposited
on the metal surface of the nanostructures, the optical field is redistributed,
resulting in the reduced decay length.

2.3 Transmission
Spectra and Resonance Field Distributions
of the Alumina-/Aluminum-Capped Nanoslits Using FDTD Calculations
To confirm and explain the observed results, we further utilized
FDTD calculations to calculate the transmission spectra and resonance
field distributions of the capped nanoslits. Figure 4a shows the calculated transmission spectra
of the 470 nm period, 22 nm thick capped aluminum nanoslits with various
thicknesses of Al2O3 films for normally incident
TM-polarized light. The structure parameters were P = 470 nm, H = 60 nm, T = 22 nm,
and W = 60 nm. The oxide layer (t) ranged from 0 to 64 nm. The Wood’s anomaly-dominant resonances
were observed in the calculated spectra. These resonance profiles
agree quite well with the measured results, as shown in Figure 3a. The resonance was red-shifted
and became broader with the increase of the deposited oxide layer. Figure 4b–f shows
the resonance field (Ez) distributions at peak wavelengths for different Al2O3 layers. Obviously, resonance field distributions changed
and were gradually confined to the oxide layer. The average decay
length, calculated from the resonance field (Ez) distributions, was 620 nm for the structure
without the dielectric layer. It decreased to 145 nm and reduced by
a factor of 4.2 when the oxide layer increased to 64 nm, as shown
in Figure 4g. A similar
tendency was observed for the asymmetric Fano resonance in capped
aluminum nanoslits. The decay lengths for the peak and dip wavelengths
were 1105 and 420 nm, respectively. When the thick oxide layer was
deposited on the metal surface, the field distribution of the Fano
mode was affected and the decay lengths reduced to 120 and 135 nm,
respectively. They reduced by factors of 9.2 and 3.1. It was noted
that the surface wavelength sensitivity is determined by the bulk
sensitivity (Sλ) and decay length
(ld). The effect of Sλ related to the dielectric-coating thickness should
also be considered. The Sλ can be
evaluated by Sλ(t) = ηSλ(0), where Sλ(0) is the bulk (wavelength) sensitivity
when t is zero and η is the overlapping degree
between the field intensity in the sensing volume (air) and all volume,
that is, 5  With the increase of the dielectric layer
thickness, more field intensity was confined to the oxide layer and
the η decreased, resulting in reduced bulk sensitivities, as
shown in Figure 4h.
Therefore, the bulk sensitivity is oxide-thickness-dependent. According
to eq 2, when the biolayer
thickness is very small, the spectral shift is proportional to the
bulk sensitivity and decay length, that is, Δλ ∝ Sλ(t)/ld = Sλ(0)(η/ld). Both the η and decay length were dependent
on the dielectric-coating thickness. The coating layer shortened the
decay length and reduced the bulk sensitivity; it caused different
decrease rates for both parameters. The competition between these
two parameters results in the optimal condition for the surface sensitivity,
as shown in Figure 4h. The optimal thickness is about 50 nm, which agrees quite well
with the measured results (see Figure 3d). Therefore, the improved surface sensitivity for
structures with dielectric layers is attributed to the reduced decay
length. Besides, owing to the decrease of bulk sensitivity, there
is an optimal condition for the coating-layer thickness.

2.4 Surface Sensitivity Tests of 470 nm Period
Alumina-/Aluminum-Capped Nanoslits by Measuring the Interactions between
BSA and Anti-BSA
To verify the surface sensitivity of the
470 nm period capped aluminum nanoslits with a 32 nm thick Al2O3 layer, we further immobilized BSA proteins on
the chip and detected different concentrations of the anti-BSA solutions,
as shown in Figure 5a. The measured transmission spectra in 1 mg/mL BSA, deionized water,
and different concentrations of anti-BSA solutions from 100 fg/mL
to 100 μg/mL are shown in Figure 5b. The Fano resonances were red-shifted with the increase
of the concentration of anti-BSA solutions. In this experiment, the
minispectrometer has a spectral resolution of 0.4 nm, which limits
the sensing capability of the structures. To enhance the limit of
detection, the spectral data can be analyzed using the spectral integration
method.20−23 The advantage of the combination of proposed structures and the
spectral integration method is illustrated in the inset of Figure 5c. As the alumina-/aluminum-capped
nanoslits are able to increase the peak and dip wavelength shifts,
the summation of the intensity changes (Rt=30), that is, the spectral integration response,
for the proposed structure is larger than that for the nanostructures
without a dielectric film (Rt=0). Therefore, the sensing capability was further improved
using the spectral integration method. The response (R) for the spectral integration method is defined by the absolute
value of the difference of the normalized intensity spectra 6  where the I(n, λ) is the transmitted intensity at a wavelength λ under
a concentration of the analyte solution (n), n0 is the reference sample, and λ1 and λ2 are the integrated wavelength range. The
intensity spectrum of the BSA was set as a reference, and the integrated
wavelength range was from λ1 = 500 nm to λ2 = 530 nm. Figure 5c shows the integrated responses caused by deionized water
and different concentrations of anti-BSA solutions. The integrated
responses for deionized water, 0.1 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, 1 ng/mL, 0.1 μg/mL,
1 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, and 100 μg/mL, were 23.8, 25.5,
33.6, 57.4, 71.8, 170.9, 598.4, and 3280%, respectively. Obviously,
the response against the logarithm of the concentration shows two
linear correlations, as shown in Figure 5c, and the concentration of the break point
is around 0.1 μg/mL. According to eq 2, the sensing response is related
to the refractive index of the biomolecules and exponential growth
as the biolayer thickness (d) increases. The equivalent
thickness increases with the concentration. Therefore, the response
behaves as an exponential curve and can be roughly fitted by two slopes. Figure 5d shows the response
against the logarithm of the concentration below 0.1 μg/mL.
The calibration curve was described by y = 7.70375(log10(x)) + 125.9461 and R2 = 0.99961, and the measured noise was 3.7% (standard deviation
of the response). As the response of the deionized water was close
to that of 100 fg/mL anti-BSA, we estimated the LOQ of the concentration
of anti-BSA to be 1 pg/mL. It is noted that for the anti-BSA detection
using a commercial prism-based SPR system, the LOQ is about 0.1 ng/mL.
The proposed dielectric-coated capped aluminum nanoslit array can
enhance the LOQ by about 2 orders of magnitude.

spectrum of the BSA solution was set as a reference. The inset shows

film. (d) Integrated response as a function of the logarithm of the
concentration of the anti-BSA solution.

3 Conclusions
The intrinsic properties
of the aluminum metal, having a large
imaginary part of the dielectric function and a longer electromagnetic
field decay length and problems of poor long-term chemical stability,
limit the surface-sensing capability and applicability of nanostructures.
We show that these limitations can be overcome using alumina-/aluminum-capped
nanoslit structures. The dielectric layer not only prevents the aluminum
from chemical damages but also effectively enhances the wavelength
sensitivities of the nanostructure-based aluminum biosensors. For
the asymmetric Fano resonance nanostructures, the surface sensitivity
was increased by a factor of 3.5 for the resonance peak. The surface
sensitivity was improved because of the significant reduction of the
decay length. The decay lengths for the Wood’s anomaly-dominant
resonance, Fano peak, and dip resonances were reduced by factors of
4.2, 9, and 2.9 for a 48 nm dielectric layer. The protein–protein
interaction experiments verified the high sensitivity of the structures,
and an LOQ of 1 pg/mL anti-BSA was achieved. As the nanostructures
were fabricated on plastic films, they can be directly integrated
to the plastic-based microfluidic devices using hot embossing nanoimprint
lithography.45 The sample pretreatment
and multiplexed detection can be conducted on a chip, which can contribute
to the moving plasmonic biosensors to point-of-care diagnosis.46 It was noted that other dielectric films such
as Si, SiO2, and HfO2 films can also be utilized
to improve the surface sensitivity. In this study, the alumina dielectric
film is chosen and is suitable for the immobilization of phosphonic
acid-ended glycans.47 The proposed structures
have the potential to be applied to a label-free glycan array. Such
low-cost, highly sensitive aluminum-based nanostructures can benefit
sensing applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Nanoimprinting Process for Metallic Nanostructures
The metallic nanostructures were produced on a polycarbonate (PC)
plastic substrate using rapid hot embossing nanoimprint lithography
and thermal evaporation. First, the metallic templates were made using
electron-beam lithography and electroforming. Periodic nanogrooves
in a 100 nm thick diluted ZEP-520 resist (ZEP-520, Zeon Corp, Tokyo,
Japan) were drawn on a 525 μm thick silicon substrate using
an electron-beam writing system (ELS-F125, Elionix, Japan). The width,
depth, and period of the periodic nanogrooves were 60, 100, and 470
nm, respectively. The patterns were deposited on a thin gold film
and then electroformed with Ni and Co to produce a 250 μm thick
metal mold. The template was used to replicate the nanostructures
on the 380 μm thick plastic film using homemade hot embossing
nanoimprint equipment.48 With the heating
temperature of 185 °C, the replicated plastic nanostructures
with a ridge height of 60 nm were made. After depositing the aluminum
films with different thicknesses of 22–50 nm on the replicated
plastic substrates, the capped aluminum nanoslit arrays were produced. Figure 6a shows the optical
image of the 416-capped aluminum nanoslit arrays on an A4-sized PC
film. The area of each array is 5 × 5 mm2. Figure 6b shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of the capped aluminum nanoslit arrays.
The ridge height is 60 nm.

ridge height of the nanostructures is 60 nm.

4.3 Optical
Setup for Transmission Spectrum Measurement
The 150 W white
light was coupled to a fiber cable and a fiber
lens for light collimation. The light was incident on a nanostructure
array after passing through a linear polarizer, which controls its
incident polarization. The transmitted light was then collected by
another fiber lens and focused on a fiber cable. The signals were
recorded by a fiber-coupled linear charge-coupled device array spectrometer
(BWTEK, BTC112E).

4.4 ALD of Aluminum Oxide
The aluminum
oxide films with different thicknesses were deposited on capped aluminum
nanoslit arrays using an ALD machine (Syskey Technology Co., Ltd.).
With the precursors of trimethylaluminum and water, the alumina films
were formed under the following deposition conditions. The substrate
temperature was kept at 120 °C, and the chamber working pressure
was set to 1.2 × 10–1 Torr.

4.5 Refractive Index Sensitivity Tests and Biosensing
Experiments
The refractive index sensitivities were checked
by measuring different water/glycerin mixtures with refractive indexes
ranging from 1.3330 to 1.3615. The BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-BSA
(Sigma-Aldrich) assays in deionized water were conducted using alumina-/aluminum-capped
nanoslit arrays. First, to form amino groups on the alumina surface,
the nanostructures were dipped in a 10% aminopropyltriethoxysilane
solution for 30 min and washed with ultrapure water. After being purged
dry by nitrogen gas, they are baked at 120 °C for 1 h. For amide
binding, the modified surface was activated by dipping the nanostructures
into a 5% glutaraldehyde amino reactive bifunctional cross-linker
at 25 °C for 30 min. After the surface modification processes,
a 100 μL of 1 mg/mL BSA solution was dropped onto the sensing
area for 1 h. To remove the unbound BSA proteins, the nanostructures
were then washed with ultrapure water and purged dry by nitrogen gas.
These procedures were repeated three times to make BSA proteins occupy
the sensing surface. Finally, a 100 μL of 100 fg/mL anti-BSA
solution was dropped onto the sensing surface for 1 h. After being
washed with ultrapure water, the structures were purged dry by nitrogen
gas. For detecting different concentrations of anti-BSA solutions
from 100 fg/mL to 100 μg/mL, the processes including dropping,
washing, and nitrogen-purged drying were subsequently repeated. All
transmission spectra before and after BSA and anti-BSA adsorption
were recorded for comparisons.
