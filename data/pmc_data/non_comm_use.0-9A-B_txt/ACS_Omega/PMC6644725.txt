A commercial compact
disk has been converted into an effective
photocatalytic nanoreactor by depositing a catalyst layer inside the
nanochannels by means of an electrophoretic method. The resultant
device has been tested for water splitting, obtaining a high yield
of hydrogen at an unbeatable low cost.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
nanoreactor concept is usually restricted to hollow structures
or cavities with a proper geometry to accommodate reactant molecules
in a way that the selectivity of the reaction is strongly enhanced.1,2 These confined reaction spaces are found abundantly in biological
systems and in several mesoporous artificial structures but they are
difficult to engineer for practical application. Microreaction technologies
using microfluidic devices, where a thin catalyst layer is fixed onto
the walls of micron-sized channels where the reactants flow, have
become popular and have demonstrated their excellence in handling
a variety of chemical transformations.3,4 The increase
of surface-to-volume ratio and the decrease of linear dimensions improve
dramatically the mass and heat transfer and as a result the overall
efficiency of the process is strongly enhanced and the process is
much better controlled. In the last decade, the fabrication of miniaturized
optofluidic platforms, which combine microfluidics and optics, has
emerged as a promising field to boost photocatalytic reactions due
to short light travel distance within the microchannels and improved
mass and photon transfer.5 A wide range
of mechanical, optical, and etching technologies can be used to manufacture
microreactors containing thousands of microchannels in a variety of
designs; but with the technologies available nowadays it is difficult
to prepare channels with widths below a few microns and when this
is possible, the processes involved are terribly laborious and expensive.6−8 Here, we demonstrate the way to convert the channels of commercial
compact disks (CD) into effective nanoreactors. In this work, we have
deposited a uniform layer of Au/TiO2 catalyst inside the
nanochannels of a CD, which measure ca. 200 nm depth × 800 nm
width. We have sealed the nanochannels with a simple silicone film
and have tested their performance in the photocatalytic generation
of hydrogen. The yield of hydrogen obtained is higher than that reported
in other photoreactors and the cost is much lower.

2 Results and Discussion
First, the commercial CD was delaminated
with ethanol to remove
the artwork and lacquer external layers and access the assemblage
of the polycarbonate matrix containing the nanochannels (Figures 1A and S1) and the thin metal layer on top of it. We
did not remove the metal layer because, as will be discussed below,
this plays a key role for the deposition of the catalyst and it is
advantageous for the photocatalytic experiment. In our case, the metal
layer was metallic silver with a thickness of about 80 nm (Figures 1C and S2). The dimensions of the channels were determined
by interferometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-focused ion
beam (FIB) and are about 200 nm depth × 800 nm width (Figure 1B,C). The CD was
cut into pieces of 2 cm length × 2.5 cm width with the nanochannels
(about 6250 channels per cm) aligned along the length.

layers in a commercial CD. (B) Interferometry
image of the nanochannels of the CD after removing the artwork and
lacquer external layers. (C) SEM image of the nanochannels and FIB
cut showing the Ag metal layer.

The Au/TiO2 photocatalyst used in this work was
prepared
separately by impregnating preformed Au nanoparticles (3–4
nm in diameter, Figure 2A) onto Degussa P90 titania (Au 1 wt %), followed by calcination
at 673 K to ensure a good contact between the Au nanoparticles and
the TiO2 support.9 This photocatalyst
was selected because it has been already fully characterized and used
in the photogeneration of hydrogen by us, so it represents the perfect
choice for a proper comparison between the hydrogen production rate
obtained in the nanochannels of the CD with respect to previous values
obtained in other photoreactor configurations.10,11 The X-ray diffraction pattern of the photocatalyst (Figure 2B) shows the characteristic
peaks of TiO2 and broad peaks at 38.2 and 44.4° corresponding
to the Au nanoparticles. As expected, after deposition and calcination,
the Au nanoparticles are metallic, as deduced from the X-ray photoelectron
spectrum shown in Figure 2C, corresponding to the Au 4f core level (peak of Au 4f7/2 at 84.0 eV).9Figure 2D corresponds to a representative
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of
the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, showing a good contact between
an Au nanoparticle and the titania support.

Several methods were attempted to deposit the Au/TiO2 catalyst particles on the nanochannels to attain a uniform
layer
without blocking the nanochannels. Casting and spin-coating proved
to be inadequate because aggregates of catalyst particles were abundant
and randomly distributed over the nanochannels, whatever the physical–chemical
properties of the solvent used (Figures S3 and S4). In contrast, electrophoresis allowed obtaining a homogeneous
layer of catalyst particles perfectly distributed over the nanochannels,
which, remarkably, were deposited exclusively inside the channels
(Figure 3). This is
of great importance for the subsequent sealing of the nanochannels
in the nanoreactor. Electrophoresis was possible, thanks to the presence
of the thin metal layer over the polycarbonate structure of the CD.
The best conditions for the electrophoretic deposition were 0.8 V
at a working distance of 6 cm for 1 min from an aqueous suspension
of catalyst of 5 mg mL–1 at pH = 13 (KOH). Under
these conditions, 1.2 μgcat cm–2 was deposited with excellent reproducibility. Taking into account
that the electrophoretic field is stronger at the corners delimited
by the nanochannels and that the pitch distance of the nanochannels
doubles that of the width of the nanochannels (ca. 1.6 μm vs
800 nm, Figure 1C),
the charged catalyst particles are likely directed toward the interior
of the nanochannels during electrophoresis, allowing for a selective
deposition of the catalyst only on the walls of the nanochannels.
Following electrophoresis, the nanochannels were gently rinsed with
ethanol and dried under Ar at room temperature. A transparent cover
of silicone film was prepared separately from poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) and bonded to the CD pieces with functionalized nanochannels
by applying an air plasma activation treatment, as described elsewhere.10 Microfluidic inlet and outlet connections were
inserted perpendicular to the nanochannels, which, according to fluid
simulations (Figure S5), ensured a homogeneous
velocity distribution.

Figure 3 (A, B) SEM images recorded at different magnifications
showing
a homogeneous Au/TiO2 catalyst layer inside the nanochannels
obtained by electrophoretic deposition (0.8 V, t =
1 min, pH = 13).

The photocatalytic tests
were performed at room temperature in
gas phase and in continuous mode by introducing Ar saturated with
water and ethanol (H2O/EtOH = 90:10 molar basis, GHSV =
5.6 × 106 h–1, W/F = 0.013 mgcat min mL–1) into the nanoreactor. Ethanol
was used as sacrificial agent to enhance the lifetime of the electron–hole
pairs generated in the TiO2 semiconductor upon light irradiation.12 A complete explanation of the physicochemical
process taking place over Au/TiO2 for the photogeneration
of hydrogen from water–ethanol can be found in the literature.12 The outlet of the nanoreactor was sampled on-line
with a gas chromatograph (GC) for the complete analysis of products.
The light source was placed perpendicular to the nanoreactor facing
the silicone cover (Figure 4A). It is composed of four light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting
at 365 ± 5 nm and a light guide for a homogeneous light distribution.13 The light irradiance was measured exactly at
the position of the nanoreactor (UV radiation monitor from Solar Light
Co.) and was varied between ca. 15 and 75 mW cm–2. The only products of the photoreaction detected by GC were hydrogen
and acetaldehyde, which originated by the oxidation of ethanol by
the holes in the valence band of the photocatalyst.10−12

(red, data from ref (10)). (C) Stability test conducted over the CD nanoreactor under ca.
75 mW cm–2.

Figure 4B
shows
the hydrogen production rates obtained at different irradiance values,
as calculated from the GC analyses and gas flow used. As expected,
the higher the irradiance the higher the hydrogen production rate.
A stability test was carried out at 75 mW cm–2 and
a remarkable constant hydrogen production rate of 38 μmol H2 min–1 g–1 was recorded
(Figure 4C), which
equals to a H2 concentration of 1.3 × 10–3%. These photocatalytic results can be compared straightforward with
those obtained in a silicone microreactor containing conventional
channels of ca. 500 μm width loaded with exactly the same Au/TiO2 photocatalyst.10 Under an irradiance
of ca. 24 mW cm–2, the hydrogen production rate
obtained with the nanoreactor almost doubles that obtained with the
conventional microreactor, 29 vs 16 μmol H2 min–1 g–1 (Figure 4B). Taking into account that these are normalized
rate values obtained with exactly the same photocatalyst under the
same conditions, the increase in the hydrogen production rate observed
when the nanoreactor is used can only be explained in terms of better
photon delivery and mass transfer, which are both critical in any
photocatalytic process.11 In the nanoreactor,
both the smaller cross section of the channels and the thinner catalyst
layer deposited over the nanochannels with respect to the conventional
microchannels (800 nm vs 500 μm width) favor mass transfer.
In addition, the metal layer of the CD beneath the catalyst layer
reflects the photons initially not absorbed and redirect them again
through the catalyst enhancing the photocatalytic process due to a
better photon usage (Figure 4A).

3 Conclusions
We have reported here a
high efficient, easy to manufacture, and
low-cost nanoreactor that can be used in a wide range of chemical
processes. We have tested a nanoreactor containing a standard Au/TiO2 photocatalyst for water splitting at room temperature (using
ethanol as sacrificial agent) and have demonstrated a remarkable performance
when compared to conventional microreactors, which is explained in
terms of both improved mass transfer and photon delivery. The critical
issue of depositing a catalyst layer selectively over the walls of
the nanochannels can be accomplished by electrophoresis, provided
that parameters such as voltage, time, and pH are accurately selected.
This work offers a simple and low-cost method to fabricate photocatalytic
nanoreactors, which could open the door for studying reaction mechanisms
and kinetics with novel photocatalysts and obviating the use of expensive
and bulky experimental setups that usually require a high quantity
of catalytic materials containing precious metals. The reported photocatalytic
nanoreactor in this work has the potential to minimize labor force,
cost of experiment, and allow for rapid optimization of reactions.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Characterization Techniques
Morphological
data were obtained using a Veeco WYKO 9300NT using the vertical scanning
interferometry mode with a magnification parameter of 100. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded at 5 kV using a Zeiss
Neon40 Crossbeam Station instrument equipped with a field emission
source. Cross-sectional images were obtained using a focused ion beam
(FIB). Cuts were performed with a Gallium FIB CANION31 operating at
30 kV and 50 pA. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra were
recorded in a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a Smart Orbit
attenuated total reflection accessory using a germanium crystal. Surface
chemical characterization was done by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
on a SPECS system. The spectrometer was equipped with a XR50 source
operating the Al anode at 150 W and a Phoibos 150 MCD-9 detector.
The pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 25 eV, and
the energy step of high-resolution spectra was set at 0.1 eV. The
pressure in the analysis chamber was always below 10–7 Pa, and binding energy values were referred to the C 1s peak at
284.8 eV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using
a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (45 kV,
35 mA) in Bragg–Brentano geometry. The diffraction patterns
were recorded in steps of 0.02° and 1 s per step. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out with a Jeol
J2010F instrument equipped with a field emission electron source operated
at 200 kV. Sample was prepared by dispersing the catalysts in methanol.
A drop of the suspension was then allowed to evaporate on a carbon-coated
copper grid.

4.2 Au Nanoparticles Preparation
and Photocatalyst
Deposition
The preparation of the model Au nanoparticles
was reported in detail in ref (9). They were synthesized following the two-phase method described
for the synthesis of dodecanethiol-capped monometallic Au nanoparticles,14 which involved the transfer of AuCl4– to a toluene solution using tetraoctylammonium
bromide followed by a single reduction step with NaBH4 in
the presence of dodecanethiol. Electrophoresis deposition of the photocatalyst
was performed using a customized setup consisting of a Promax FA-665
voltage source, support for electrodes designed for working with different
distances and with space for a reference electrode in the middle,
connected to a LECROY WAVESURFER 24XS oscilloscope. As counter electrode,
another CD sample of the same area than the one placed in the working
electrode was used.

4.3 Photocatalytic Experiments
Photocatalytic
tests were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure
in the prepared photocatalytic nanoreactor. An argon stream of 4.7
mL min–1 was bubbled to a Dreschel bottle containing
EtOH and H2O to obtain a gaseous reactant mixture of EtOH/H2O = 1:9 (molar basis), which was directly introduced into
the nanoreactor. The reactor is built with two tygon tubes, one provided
with a gaseous reagents stream inlet and the second one provided with
an outlet, which was continuously monitored by a microgas chromatograph
(GC) Agilent 490. The GC was equipped with MS 5 Å, Plot U, and
Stabilwax columns for a complete and continuous analysis of the photoreaction
products. The UV light source used to illuminate the photoreactor
was purchased from SACOPA, S.A.U. It is composed of four LEDs at 365
± 5 nm and a synthetic quartz glass (UV grade fused silica) cylindrical
lens that transmits the light to the photocatalytic nanoreactor.
