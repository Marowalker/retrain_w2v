Mesoporous
hafnium dioxide (HfO2) thin films (around
20 nm thick) were fabricated by a sol–gel-based spin-coating
process, followed by an annealing process at 600 °C to realize
the ion-conducting media for the ionics (e.g., Na+ and
K+ for rechargeable ion batteries). Another film of aluminum
metal (10 nm thick) was deposited by direct current sputtering to
soak into the mesopores. A monitored thermal treatment process at
500 °C in the air yields mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films. However, aluminum dioxide
(Al2O3) is formed during annealing as an insulating
film to reduce the leakage current while retaining the ionic conductivity.
The obtained mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 films show a leakage current at 3.2 × 10–9 A cm–2, which is significantly smaller than that
of the mesoporous HfO2 film (1.37 × 10–5 A cm–2) or HfO2/Al film (0.037 A cm–2) at a bias voltage of 1.0 V, which is enough for
ion conduction. In the meantime, among all the thin films, the mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films display
the smallest Nyquist arc diameter in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, implying
a lower impedance at the electrode/electrolyte interface and reflecting
a better ion diffusion and movement.

Introduction
Thin films of hafnium
dioxide (HfO2) have received considerable
attention as a dielectric material so far.1−3 Consequently,
several approaches have been proposed to improve the electrical and
physical properties of HfO2. Yang et al.4 and Liu et al.5 were the first
to report on the formation of an amorphous mesoporous HfO2 framework through a chemical method using block copolymers and surfactants
as sacrificial templates. The mesoporosity throughout the entire morphology
improved the thermal stability of HfO2 as well as provided
a high specific surface area for further catalytic applications. For
example, H(CH2CH2CH2(CH)CH2CH3)89(OCH2CH2)79OH block copolymer (abbreviated as KLE) was used as a structure-directing
large agent that generated a distorted cubic arrangement of spherical
mesopores in crystalline HfO2 thin films.6 The main benefit of the block copolymer is that it stabilizes
the mesostructure of hafnium oxide up to 450 °C due to the stability
of the polymer. In the same context, Malfatti and co-workers prepared
HfO2 films with a highly ordered rhombohedral mesostructure
using a commercial Pluronic F-127 triblock copolymer.7 The hafnia thin films were tunable, which gave a chance
to control the reversible disorder–order transitions in the
mesophase by changing the relative humidity and using X-ray. Other
advantages in this context are that mesoporous materials are extensively
studied for ion-conductive devices, such as rechargeable ion batteries.8 The pores provide large channels and a short
diffusion distance for facile ion mass transportation.

On the
other hand, HfO2-based ceramic thin films were
proposed to stabilize hafnias thin films.9,10 In
this scenario, Park et al. reported the addition of aluminum dioxide
(Al2O3) to HfO2 thin films by a plasma-enhanced
atomic layer deposition method.11 The HfO2 thin films are completely stabilized at room temperature
and the crystallographic direction was changed to the preferred (002)
orientation (i.e., tetragonal phase), resulting in an increase in
the dielectric constant (47), which is approximately twice the reported
value for the HfO2 film with a monoclinic phase. In addition,
Zheng et al. reported the direct growth of Al2O3-doped HfO2 films onto graphene by H2O-based
atom layer deposition (ALD). Al2O3 acted as
a network modifier, maintained the amorphous structure of the film
even to 800 °C, and made the film smooth with a root mean square
roughness of 0.8 nm.12 Although ALD produces
uniform films, it introduces undesired impurities or break the chemical
bonds of graphene, resulting in a significant degradation in carrier
mobility.13−15 Meanwhile, aluminum dioxide (Al2O3) is an appropriate material for HfO2-based ceramics
because of its unique insulating properties for gate dielectric, tunneling
barrier, and protection coating. Moreover, it has strong adhesion
properties, excellent dielectric features, and thermal and chemical
stabilities. Al2O3 has a high band gap (around
9 eV), high breakdown electric field (5–10 MV cm–1), high permittivity (8.6–10), and high thermal stability
(up to 1200 °C).16

Mesoporous
metal oxide thin films can offer a good template for
engineering strains. Recently, we used mesoporous materials for vertical
strain engineering in nanostructured SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 layers through an easy chemical method.17 The dielectric and ferroelectric properties and Curie temperature
(Tc) are improved in the case of highly
strained mesostructured SrTiO3/BaTiO3composite
thin films.17 This concept was further
developed recently for the preparation of multilayered hybrid thin
films composed of nanostructured SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 layers, which had a very low leakage current of 1.3 × 10–9 A cm–2 at 1.0 V compared to that
of SrTiO3 or bilayer SrTiO3/BaTiO3 thin films (0.01 A cm–2) in Pt/SrTiO3/BaTiO3/SrTiO3/BaTiO3/Pt dielectric
capacitor.18

In this contribution,
mesoporous HfO2 thin films (around
20 nm thick) were fabricated by the sol–gel-based spin-coating
process followed by controlled annealing treatments at 600 °C
in air to realize the ion conducting media for ionics in ion-conducting
deceives. Unfortunately, a former porous medium such as a mesoporous
HfO2 was so leaky that it cannot give higher bias and shows
low stability. Therefore, we used the mesoporous HfO2 thin
films as hard templates for scalable crystallization of highly strained
Al2O3 crystals soaked inside the mesopores.
To control the growth of Al2O3 inside the mesopores,
we performed regulated annealing in air, which helps in the fusion
of Al2O3 in the mesoporous frameworks gradually.
Moreover, an insulating thin film of Al2O3 is
formed on the surface of the mesoporous HfO2 film to improve
the stability and reduce the leakage current while keeping the ionic
conductivity. The interstitial surface area between the two materials
is expected to greatly improve because of the concave shape of the
mesoporous framework.19 This advantage
gives an opportunity for crystal lattice changes to reduce the leakage
current of the HfO2/Al2O3 composite
layers, keep the mesoporous structure intact, and improve the stability.20

Results and Discussion
For the preparation
of mesoporous HfO2 thin films on
Si and/or Si/SiO2/Ti/Pt substrates, Pluronic F-127 was
used as a soft template. The porous textural characteristics of the
thin films were controlled by tuning the amounts of Pluronic F-127
and calcination temperature (Table 1). On the other hand, for the synthesis of mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films,
a 10 nm thick Al layer was coated on HfO2 by direct current
(DC) sputtering, which when heated at 500 °C oxidizes and converts
into Al2O3 fused inside the mesopores of the
HfO2 framework thin film.

The optimum ratios
of the block copolymer to the inorganic source
(HfCl4) were investigated. The weight ratios of Pluronic
F-127 to HfCl4 were varied from 0.6 to 1.4 (Table 1). The surface morphology of
the obtained thin films calcined at 600 °C was examined using
a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figure 1). It is observed that the films are distorted
and cracked with the increase of the amount of Pluronic F-127. This
was confirmed by two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence small-angle
scattering (SAXS) images and the corresponding patterns, as shown
in Figure 2. The film
obtained with low amount of Pluronic F-127 showed the most intense
peak at around 2θ = 0.49° (d = 18.01 nm)
derived from the well-ordered close-packing of the mesopores (Figure 2a). Therefore, the
preferred weight ratio of Pluronic F-127 to HfCl4 is 0.6
to form well-ordered mesoporous HfO2 frameworks. The crystal
structure of the obtained mesoporous framework was examined using
a wide-angle 2D X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Figure S1). All the mesoporous HfO2 thin films
obtained at different weight ratios showed diffraction peaks consistent
with a monoclinic HfO2 (PDF Card No. 00-006-0318).6 The structure and elemental distribution of Hf
and O atoms were investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometers
attached to the SEM (Figure S2). The film
is composed of Hf and O atoms homogeneously distributed over the entire
mesoporous HfO2 thin films.

To study the effect of the calcination temperature
on the crystallinity
and morphology of the mesoporous HfO2 framework, we applied
various calcination temperatures in air to remove the organic template.
From the SEM images, it is obvious that calcination at 400 and 500
°C is not enough to totally remove the template (Figure S3a,b). Meanwhile the films obtained at
400 and 500 °C are amorphous because of, may be, the incomplete
removal of organic residues (Figure S4a,b). By further increase in the calcination temperature up to 700 and
800 °C, the mesoporous framework is collapsed by further crystallization
(Figure S3c,d). The crystallinity of the
corresponding films is improved, as shown in Figure S4c,d. Although the crystallinity is improved at elevated temperatures,
collapsing the mesoporous framework destroys the mesoporous pass,
which is not favorable for the movement of ions. Moreover, from 2D
GI-SAXS images and the corresponding patterns (Figure S5), the films obtained at 400, 500, 700, and 800 °C
did not show any ordering or periodicity of the mesopores. Therefore,
the optimum calcination temperature to remove the template and obtain
well-ordered mesoporous HfO2 thin films with a crystallized
framework is 600 °C.

The mesoporous HfO2 thin
films obtained at optimum conditions
were further characterized using a transmission electron microscope
(TEM), as shown in Figure 3a. The thin film shows a porous nature and, at the same time,
the selected area electron diffraction image (ED; inset of Figure 3a) shows intense
diffraction spots corresponding to the (102), (221), and (011) reflections
of the monoclinic phase (PDF Card No. 00-006-0318).21 The crystalline nature of the mesoporous framework was
further examined by a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), as shown in Figure 3b. Well-organized
and ordered atomic lattices reveal the single crystalline nature of
the framework. The high-angle annular dark filed-scanning transmission
electron microspore (HAADF-STEM; Figure 3c) and the corresponding elemental mapping
of Hf and O atoms reflects the porous nature of the film, which is
composed of Hf and O atoms with a homogeneous distribution over the
entire thin film.

the corresponding
elemental mapping images of mesoporous HfO2 thin films

of Si substrate at 600 °C (the optimum mesoporous sample).

The optimized mesoporous HfO2 thin films
were used as
a template for strain engineering and scalable formation of Al2O3 crystals. Engineering strains in metal oxide
thin films received a great consideration for controlling structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties in many functional systems.22−30 Suzuki et al. have reported the use of mesoporous SrTiO3 thin films to engineering strains in BaTiO3 crystals
through a surfactant-templated sol–gel method.17 The obtained mesostructured SrTiO3/BaTiO3 composite thin films with a large number of strains showed
a dramatic enhancement of ferroelectric property. This result opened
a door for strain engineering using mesoporous inorganic thin films
for dielectric capacitors and enhancing strain-driven functionalities.18,31 Herein, for controlling the crystallization of Al2O3 crystals and creating strains, the mesoporous HfO2 is used as a template. The crystalline nature of HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films was examined using
a wide-angle 2D XRD (Figure 4). The peaks positions are assignable to an orthorhombic HfO2 phase32 (PDF Card No. 00-040-1173)
and polycrystalline Al2O3.33−36 The selected area electron diffraction
image (ED; inset of Figure 5) shows intense diffraction spots corresponding to the (012),
(103), and (024) reflections to an orthorhombic HfO2 phase.
The other various and random spots reveal the polycrystalline nature
of the formed Al2O3 crystals inside the mesoporous
framework. From this result, we noticed that the crystallographic
direction of HfO2 thin films was changed to the (012) orientation
(i.e., an orthorhombic phase) during crystallization of Al2O3 by heating.16 From TEM (Figure 5a), it is obvious
that the mesopores are filled with Al2O3 and,
moreover, a thin film of Al2O3 formed in the
top with high insulating property. The HRTEM of a selected area reflects
the interference of different atomic lattices coming from both HfO2 and Al2O3 (Figure 5b). The structure and elemental distribution
of Hf, Al, and O atoms were investigated by EDX spectrometers attached
to the SEM (Figure S6); the film is composed
of Hf, Al, and O atoms that are distributed over the entire HfO2/Al2O3 thin film. The structure and
elemental distribution of Hf, Al, and O atoms of the mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin film was
further investigated by low- and high-magnification cross-sectional
HAADF-STEM (Figure 6a,b). Obviously, thin film of the mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite was obtained on the Pt substrate.
From the elemental mapping, the film is composed of Hf, Al, and O
atoms with heterogeneous distributions in a layered manner.

The reduction of leakage current of hafnias thin films is a crucial
factor for their potential in electric applications. In capacitors,
the leakage current behaviors have been extensively investigated and
some leakage mechanisms have been proposed to account for the corresponding
results, for example, formation of composite thin films was found
to greatly affect electrical properties.37 In this study, we develop a synthetic approach for the formation
of mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite
thin films to monitor current passage. The schematic illustration
of the fabricated electrode is presented in Figure 7a. The diameter of the upper Pt electrode
was monitored to be 125 μm using a Pt mask (Figure 7b). A mesoporous HfO2 thin film was fabricated by a spin-coating process with a speed
of 3000 rpm min–1 for 45 s on top of the Pt substrate
(Figure 7c). The film
thickness was determined by cross-sectional SEM to be around 20 nm
(Figure 7d). After
the deposition of a 10 nm thick film of Al metal by DC sputtering,
the regulated thermal treatments produced Al2O3 inside the pores of the HfO2 film, yielding a mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin film, as
well as a thinner Al2O3 film at its surface
(Figure 7e). The overall
thickness of the mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 film was measured to be around 30 nm (Figure 7f).

HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films prepared

We performed electrical measurements of HfO2, HfO2/Al, and HfO2/Al2O3 thin
films prepared on the Pt electrode in a vertical direction with microscale
electrodes (Figure 8). The HfO2 and HfO2/Al thin films showed high
leakage currents at around 1.37 × 10–5 and
10.5 A cm–2 at 1.0 V, respectively, revealing the
low stability of the HfO2 and HfO2/Al thin films
and suggesting that the mesoporous framework is not able to effectively
reduce the passage of current at a high bias, which is suitable for
ion-conducting devices. In contrast, the mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films show a significant
low leakage current of 3.2 × 10–9 A cm–2 at 1.0 V. We anticipate that the improvement of the
leakage current in the case the mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films is caused by the effective
stress caused at the interfaces between the HfO2 and Al2O3 domains. This phenomenon is being revealed by
the new research on strain engineering/lattice changes and their effects
on the electric properties. For example, so far, Choi et al. demonstrated
the improvement of ferroelectricity in strained BaTiO3 thin
films.38 At the same time, during the formation
of Al2O3 crystals, a phase transformation of
the monoclinic HfO2 to the (012) orientation (orthorhombic
phase) occurred. The improved crystallinity resulted in the increasing
stability of HfO2 thin films, resulting in a remarkable
enhancement of reduced leakage current.16 Additionally, formation of a highly resistive thin film of Al2O3 on the surface of mesoporous HfO2 reduces the electric current because of its high insulating property.

Figure 8 J–V curves to determine
the leakage current of mesoporous HfO2 thin films obtained
at 600 °C, HfO2/Al double layers, and mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films prepared
on Si/SiO2/Ti/Pt substrate.

For faster ion movements, a higher bias is needed. However, a former
porous medium such as a mesoporous HfO2 film was so leaky
that it cannot give a higher bias and shows low stability. Therefore,
we designed the new mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films for easy ion movement with a lower electron
current (higher insulating property). The deposited Al2O3 covers the surface of the porous nanohole to reduce
the surface states, which contributes to the leak current while keeping
the porous structure intact. To check the conductivity of our sample
thin films, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
in 1.0 M KOH at 0.7 V in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz.
The Nyquist complex-plane impedance spectra of the thin films are
shown in Figure 9.
Among all the thin films, the mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films display the smallest arc
diameter, implying a lower impedance at the electrode/electrolyte
interface and reflecting better ion diffusion and movement at the
electrode/electrolyte interface.

Conclusions
Formation of a highly
ordered mesoporous HfO2 thin film
prepared by the sol–gel method to control the growth of Al2O3 inside the porous framework is reported. In
the first stage, the mesoporous thin film of HfO2 is prepared
by sol–gel-based spin-coating processes. Pluronic F-127 triblock
copolymer is used as a template and subsequent annealing in air is
applied in the final stage to remove it. Another film of aluminum
metal (10 nm thick) was developed by DC sputtering in the second stage.
A controlled thermal treatment in aerobics of HfO2/Al layers
results in the oxidation of aluminum metal and its fusion inside and
on the top of the mesopores HfO2 thin films. The mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 composite thin films with
a much reduced leakage current compared to that of HfO2 or HfO2/Al thin films were obtained. Our synthetic approach
is easy and economical compared to the complicated and expensive physical
deposition technology, and we anticipate that our concept will open
the door for the fabrication of ion conducting devices in the future.

Experimental
Details
Chemicals
Pluronic F-127 and hafnium(IV) chloride (99.9%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Co. Ethanol (99.5%), tetrahydrofuran
(98%), and potassium hydroxide solution (1.0 M KOH) were purchased
from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. All chemicals were used as delivered with
no further purifications.

Fabrication of Substrates
The substrates
were prepared
in typical procedures of our previously published article18 using p-type Si(100) wafers of 1–10 Ω
cm with a thermal SiO2 film (200 nm thick) purchased from
AKI Corporation. OFPR-800LB photoresist purchased from Tokyo Ohka
was spin-coated on the wafer surface for protection. By applying O2 plasma for 3 min with O2 flow of 100 sccm, radio
frequency and power of 300 W for cleaning, the wafer was heated on
a hotplate at 120 °C for more than 1 min. Hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS “OAP”) purchased from Tokyo Ohka was spin-coated
as an adhesion promoter with a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 5.0 s. For
a second round to protect the surface, OFPR-800LB photoresist was
spin-coated, and the wafer was subsequently heated on a hotplate for
drying the resist film at 120 °C for 5 min. The substrate was
fixed on an adhesive sheet with the backside up for dicing and the
following parameters were used: blade width: 30 μm, wafer thickness:
380 μm, and cutting depth: 130 μm. The substrate was sonicated
in acetone for 3 min, sonicated in isopropyl alcohol for 3 min, and
rinsed in deionized water 3 times for resist removal. The treatments
with a sulfur-peroxide mixture were done as follow; H2O2 30 wt % and H2SO4 98% (100 mL, v/v
= 1) were mixed, the wafer was dipped into this mixture for 45 min,
rinsed with deionized water for four times, and finally dried with
a dry nitrogen gas stream. Thin film of Ti with a 50 nm thickness
was deposited under base pressure of ∼3 × 10–5 Pa with an evaporation source distance of 500 mm from the substrate
by e-beam (Vacc = 10 kV) at ∼0.1
nm s–1, and finally the deposition of a Pt layer
(100 nm) was performed by e-beam (Vacc = 10 kV) at ∼0.1 nm s–1 as well.

Preparation
of Mesoporous HfO2 Thin Films
Different amounts
of Pluronic F-127 were used (Table 1). In a typical procedure, Pluronic F-127
was dissolved in 10 mL of THF under stirring at room temperature until
the solution became transparent (A). Another solution is prepared
by dissolving 0.5 g of HfCl4 in H2O (0.4 g)
and ETOH (8.0 g) under stirring until a clear solution (B) was obtained.
The two solutions are mixed dropwise, and the stirring is continued
for 5 h to get the sol. The film is prepared into the substrate by
spin-coating at a rotation rate of 300 rpm s–1 for
40 s. After coating, the film is transferred to a humidity chamber
(95 %) and aged for 10 min–1 to improve the metal
framework cross-linking. The template is removed by heating at the
designated temperature (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C) for 1
h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. All calcination
processes are carried out in the aerobics.

Preparation of Mesostructured
HfO2/Al2O3 Composite Thin Films
An Al metal layer
(10 nm thick) was coated on HfO2 by DC sputtering at a
very low pressure. By heating at 500 °C, the Al metal oxides
and converts into Al2O3 fused inside and
on the top of the mesopores of HfO2 framework to form the
mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite
thin films. The upper Pt electrode (150 nm thick) was fabricated by
DC sputtering using a shadow metal mask with a diameter of 120 μm.

Characterization
Electron microscopy images were collected
using a Hitachi SU8000 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV and current of 10 mA. A JEM-2100F TEM system operated
at 200 kV and attached to an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscope
was used for elemental mapping. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
were performed by a Rigaku RINT 2500X diffractometer with a monochromated
Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) at a low scan rate (0.5 °C
min–1). Two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2D XRD)
analyses were carried out using a Bruker D8 XRD system. Small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses (GI mode) and the corresponding low-angle
XRD profiles were obtained using a Nano Viewer (Rigaku, Japan) SAXS
instrument attached to a Micro Max-007 HF high-intensity microfocus
rotating anode X-ray generator within 8 h at λ = 0.1540 nm of
the X-ray beam. The d-spacing of the mesopores was
calculated using Bragg’s law (2d sin θ
= nλ). Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed
using a source-measurement unit (Keithley, 2612B) and LCR meter (Agilent
E4980A), respectively, at a current compliance of 1 mA. The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CHI 660EZ electrochemical
workstation using a conventional three-electrode cell. Carbon rod
was used as a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode
served as a reference electrode. The mesoporous HfO2 thin
films obtained at 600 °C, HfO2/Al double layers, and
mesostructured HfO2/Al2O3 composite
thin films prepared on the Si/SiO2/Ti/Pt substrate (1.0
cm2) were used as working electrodes.
