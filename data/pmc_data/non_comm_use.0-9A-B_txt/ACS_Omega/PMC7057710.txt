This paper proposes a parameter-free
mathematical model of analyzing either monosite or multisite temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) spectra. By linearizing the integral function difference,
the desorption kinetic parameters, such as the desorption order n, the desorption activation energy Ed, and the pre-exponential factor ν, can be extracted
simultaneously with promising accuracy. A custom “ant”
is further established in the model to explore the spectra by a “prediction–correction”
loop, and the kinetics and the coverage distribution of the individual
peak in the spectra can be solved sequentially. Meanwhile, eight cases
on spectrum analysis, including but not limited to the spectrum with
coverage-dependent kinetics, the spectrum affected by the noise, the
practical spectrum, are demonstrated to fully understand the model’s
principle, process, and application. Moreover, the model optimization
and resolution limitation are further discussed to stimulate the future
potential of the innovative parameter-free model.

Introduction
Temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) is one of the powerful techniques developed for surface
catalysis study.1−3 The
adsorbate interaction,4 the molecule surface
reaction,5 and the standard entropies of
adsorbed molecules6,7 can be evaluated by analyzing
their TPD kinetics. For instance, the interaction between CO2 and the dissociative water on the CaO films,8 or the interaction between the water and the two-dimensional silica
and aluminosilicate bilayers,9 can be revealed
by analyzing the TPD spectra. Besides, the TPD kinetics can help identify
the surface reaction route for the redox reaction of H2 and H+ on the platinum/nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon
composites.10 Usually, the adsorbate desorption
rate is given by the Polanyi–Wigner equation7,11 1  where θ
is the transient coverage, t is the time, ν
is the pre-exponential factor, n is the desorption
kinetic order, Ed is the desorption activation
energy, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

To extract the TPD kinetic parameters,
Redhead proposed a method of determining the desorption activation
energy based on the temperature corresponding to the maximum desorption
rate. This method had some limitations, such as the activation energy
and pre-exponential factor that were independent of the surface coverage,
and the heating rate had to change by at least two orders of magnitude
to achieve reasonable accuracy.12 King
overcame those limitations by establishing a complete lineshape analysis
method, which, however, relied on a reasonable assumption of the pre-exponential
factor.11 Although Habenschaden and Küppers
eliminated the guess of the pre-exponential factor, their method was
strongly limited to the onset of the desorption at very low temperature,
which required adequate measurement accuracy.13 Miller et al. further classified those methods into two groups,
namely, the integral and differential approaches. The integral approaches,
such as the Redhead analysis, were thought to extract the coverage-independent
kinetic parameters,14 while the differential
approaches, such as the lineshape-related analysis, could predict
reliable coverage-dependent results.15 In
addition, other methods based on the statistical analysis16 or the process variation17,18 were
also discussed. However, most methods or models assumed a preliminary
pre-exponential factor,19,20 or the parameter dependency,11,21,22 and the experimental conditions
were strictly limited to a specific process.23 As a result, a variational method was proposed to determine the
pre-exponential factor by minimizing the difference between the simulated
TPD spectrum and the experimental results.20,24,25 Alternatively, the pre-exponential factor
was also approximated by the peak’s position and width.26,27

Nevertheless, few works made the simultaneous predictions
of the kinetic order, the desorption activation energy, and the pre-exponential
factor without assumptions. This paper innovatively establishes a
parameter-free analysis model by linearizing the integral function
difference between every two adjacent discretized nodes. Also, eight
cases are demonstrated to help fully understand the model’s
principle, process, and application. Besides, further discussions
on model optimization and limitation are given to stimulate the future
potential of the proposed model.

Results
and Discussion
Theoretical Basis of the
Parameter-Free Analysis Model
Under a linear temperature
program, the Polanyi–Wigner equation gives 2  where β = dT/dt is the heating rate.

Its integral form g(θ) over [θi, θi – Δθ] can be written
as 3  where Δθ
is the change in the coverage over ΔT, while
θi and (θi – Δθ) are the transient coverages of the
two adjacent nodes in the corresponding segment, respectively, which
would be explained later.

In case of zero/first/second-order
desorption, g(θi, θi – Δθ) can
be determined as 4  However, the term
on the right hand of eq 3 does not have an analytical solution. Therefore, this term is usually
replaced by several useful approximations.28,29 Inspired
by Ortega’s linear integral method,30,31 when
ΔT → 0 and Δθ → 0,
the desorption activation energy Ed, the
pre-exponential factor ν, and the experimental condition β
in each segment can be considered as constant. Thus, eq 3 can be rewritten as 5  Then, 6  The flow chart for analyzing a monosite TPD
spectrum by the proposed parameter-free model is summarized in Figure 1a. A look at the
TPD spectrum shows that the model first calculates the initial adsorbate
coverage θ0 and the spectrum is discretized into
segments by a user-defined ΔT as explained
in Figure 1b. Then, g(θi, θi – Δθ) at every two adjacent nodes,
which are marked yellow, are determined, and the corresponding natural
logarithm results are plotted against the reciprocal of the temperature.
The kinetic order n is judged by the goodness-of-linear
fit of the different order desorption equations in eq 4. Accordingly, the desorption activation
energy Ed and the pre-exponential factor
ν are given by the slope and intercept of the best-fitting results,
respectively.

analyzing a monosite TPD spectrum: (a) the prediction flow chart and
(b) a user-defined ΔT-based discretization.

For a multisite TPD spectrum, the prediction flow
chart is illuminated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Flow chart
for analyzing
a multisite TPD spectrum by the proposed parameter-free model.

Taking a two-site TPD spectrum as an example, the
model first reads the spectrum and calculates its initial coverage
θ0. Because there are two desorption peaks in the
spectrum, the discretized nodes cannot be treated as a whole. Alternatively,
in addition to a user-defined ΔT, an “ant”,
which consists of a certain number of continuous discretized nodes,
is defined. Therefore, the ant has two parameters, namely, the ant’s
length and its moving step in the form of the node number. Figure 3a schematically shows
that a user-defined ant has a length of six discretized nodes. In
the first cycle, the process is the same as the explanations in the
aforementioned monosite TPD spectrum analysis, g(θi, θi –
Δθ) at every two adjacent nodes of the six nodes are calculated
sequentially. Then, their natural logarithm results are linearly fitted
against the reciprocal of the temperature. Therefore, the kinetic
parameters and the coefficients of determination (R2) are given. The ant continues to explore by moving two
nodes as shown in Figure 3b. The updated six nodes are processed again in the same way
to obtain the new results in the second cycle. Thereafter, the ant
moves cycle by cycle to access all the nodes until the end, as shown
in Figure 3c. As a
result, the predicted kinetic parameters with respect to the increasing
cycles are depicted, and the “terraces”, or the constant
results are searched to identify the exact kinetic parameters for
either peak.

a user-defined ant’s (a) length, (b) moving step, and (c) final
cycle when analyzing a two-site TPD spectrum.

In the next step, the model introduces a “prediction–correction”
loop to calculate the coverage θ of the previously identified
peak. The θ–T curve is first initialized
by the Runge–Kutta method based on the obtained kinetic parameters
and a guessed coverage θ. Subsequently, the θr–T curve is obtained by subtracting the θ–T curve from the θ0–T curve. Its coverage θr is then calculated and checked
if it is less than 0. If not, the previously guessed coverage θ
is corrected by (θ + Δθ′). The loop does
not terminate until the calculated θr is less than
0, and the peak’s coverage θ is finalized by subtracting
Δθ′ from the coverage θ in the last loop.
At last, the corresponding θr–T spectrum is revisited by the ant to extract its own kinetic parameters.
Case II in the following section would demonstrate in detail how does
the model handle a two-site TPD spectrum.

Case Studies for Model Basic Analysis
In this section,
two cases are demonstrated to use the proposed model to analyze a
monosite and a multisite artificial TPD spectrum, respectively.

Case I: Three typical monosite TPD spectra are firstly generated
based on the Runge–Kutta method in Figure 4a, namely, the zero-order kinetic TPD spectrum
(Ed = 30 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 108 ML·s–1), the first-order kinetic TPD spectrum (Ed = 60 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 1018 s–1), and the second-order kinetic TPD
spectrum (Ed = 50 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 1015 ML–1·s–1). The model discretizes these curves and calculates
the difference of the g functions between any two
adjacent nodes with three different kinetic order equations. The natural
logarithms of the results are plotted against the reciprocal of the
temperature in Figure 4b–d, respectively. Taking the artificial zero-order TPD spectrum
as an example, Figure 4b clearly shows that the results of the g function
in the form of the zero order have a perfect linear relationship,
and the linear line’s slope and intercept are determined as
−3605.04 and 16.10, respectively. Therefore, the input spectrum
has a zero kinetic order and the Ed and
ν are predicted as 29.97 kJ·mol–1 and
9.82 × 107 ML·s–1, respectively.
All of the predicted kinetic parameters are compared with the input
counterparts in Table 1, and the consistent results prove that the proposed model is reliable
for extracting kinetic parameters from a monosite TPD spectrum.

artificial monosite
spectra: (a) the input monosite spectra and (b–d) the model
prediction results in the form of zero-, first-, and second-order
equations for each input spectrum.

Case II: In Figure 5a, the main site desorption spectrum follows the first-order kinetics
(Ed = 60 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 1018 s–1), while
the defect site desorption spectrum has second-order kinetics (Ed = 40 kJ·mol–1, ν
= 5 × 1010 ML–1·s–1). Then, the two spectra are merged to produce a two-site TPD spectrum
in Figure 5b.

Figure 5 Model analysis on a two-site
spectrum: (a) the individual
spectra simulated for the main and the defect sites (b) and then merged
into a two-site spectrum for the model analysis; the comparison of
the desorption activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and coefficient
of determination in each cycle solved by the g functions
in terms of the (c) zero-, (d) first-, and (e) second-order kinetics,
respectively.

The two-site spectrum is first discretized into nodes by ΔT = 0.1 K, and a custom ant consists of 100 nodes; therefore,
the ant itself covers a temperature range of 9.9 K. The ant’s
step size is 20 nodes, which means that it will move by 2 K in each
cycle. In this case, the start and end temperatures for the model
analysis are 102 and 247.9 K, respectively. Therefore, the total number
of loop cycles is 69. The natural logarithm of the g functions in terms of the zero-, first-, and second-order kinetics
are calculated separately in Figure 5c–e, and then the results are linearly fitted
against the reciprocal of the temperature to determine the desorption
activation energy, the pre-exponential factor, and the coefficient
of determination (R2).

By searching
and identifying the terraces in the diagram, the model predicts that
there is a second-order spectrum after 40 cycles in Figure 5e, and the predicted results
are summarized in Table S1. Starting from
180 K, the desorption energies and the corresponding pre-exponential
factors are almost constant, and the values of R2 are close to 1. Therefore, the average desorption energy
between 180 and 223.9 K is approximately 40 kJ·mol–1, while the average pre-exponential factor is 4.98 × 1010 ML–1·s–1.

In the next step, the coverage θ of the above-mentioned second-order
spectrum is initially guessed as 0.1 ML, and its coverage distribution
θ–T (red solid line) is calculated by
the Runge–Kutta method in Figure 6a. Then, the residual coverage distribution
θr–T (red dotted line), is
obtained by subtracting θ–T from the
original coverage distribution θ0–T (blue solid line). Thereafter, as shown in Figure 6b–e, the loop begins
by correcting the guessed coverage θ to (θ + Δθ′),
where Δθ′ = 0.1 ML, and the loop does not terminate
until the residual coverage after the subtraction at about 175 K is
less than 0 in the last loop when θ = 0.5 ML. Therefore, the
coverage θ of the above-mentioned second-order spectrum is 0.4
ML, which is the correct value in the previous loop. In short, a spectrum
between 180 and 223.9 K is predicted to have a coverage of 0.4 ML
with the second-order kinetics (Ed = 40
kJ·mol–1, ν = 4.98 × 1010 ML–1·s–1).

spectrum when the prediction coverages are (a) 0.1 ML, (b) 0.2 ML,
(c) 0.3 ML, (d) 0.4 ML, and (e) 0.5 ML, respectively.

As a result,
the residual coverage distribution θr–T is employed for the model analysis again. The left spectrum
is roughly located between 154 and 174 K or between 27 and 32 cycles,
and its kinetic parameters are extracted in a similar way; the results
are compared in Figure 7. Only the first-order fitting results have the terrace-like behavior,
and the values of R2 are close to 1, so
the spectrum follows the first-order kinetics (Ed = 59.83 kJ·mol–1, ν = 9.27 ×
1017 s–1).

Case Studies for Model Advanced Analysis
In this section,
another six cases, namely, Cases III–VIII, with either an artificial
or a practical TPD spectrum, demonstrate the model’s potential
of handling advanced analysis.

Case III: The heating rate is
an important parameter in the TPD experiment. This case simulates
the zero-order TPD spectra (Ed = 30 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 108 ML·s–1) under three heating rates, namely, 0.8, 1.0, and
1.2 K·s–1, in Figure S1a. The model analysis results are demonstrated in Figure S1b–d. The results indicate that all the three
spectra follow the zero-order desorption kinetics. Besides, the desorption
energy Ed is approximately 29.97 kJ·mol–1, while the pre-exponential factors are between 9.79
× 107 and 9.84 × 107 ML·s–1. Therefore, the proposed model is proved to extract
the kinetic parameters from the TPD spectra regardless of the heating
rate.

Case IV: The initial surface coverage is another parameter
in the TPD experiments. This case takes the second-order TPD spectrum
(Ed = 50 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 1015 ML–1·s–1) as an example, the initial surface coverage increases
from 0.5 to 1.0 ML, then to 1.5 ML in Figure S2a. The model analysis results are compared in Figure S2b–d. All the spectra are proved to be of the
second order, and the desorption energy Ed and the pre-exponential factor ν are evaluated to be 49.90
kJ·mol–1 and 9.36 × 1014 ML–1·s–1, respectively. In addition,
the intercepts of the linear fitting lines in Figure S2b–d are constant, while that in Figure S1b–d vary from 15.92 to 16.32.
It may indicate that the pre-exponential factor is more sensitive
to the heating rate than to the initial coverage.

Case V: Different
from the spectrum with the coverage-independent kinetic parameters
in Case IV, this case employs three monosite TPD spectra with coverage-dependent
parameters. The linear relation between the desorption energy and
coverage is given by eq 7, while the compensation effect between the desorption energy and
the pre-exponential factor is given by eq 8. 7   8  The three
first-order TPD spectra with coverage-dependent parameters are given
in Figure S3a. The initial coverage increases Ed and ν simultaneously, from 57.5 kJ·mol–1 and 1.53 × 1017 s–1 when the coverage is 0.5 ML to 60.0 kJ·mol–1 and 1.00 × 1018 s–1 when the coverage
is 1.0 ML, and then to 62.5 kJ·mol–1 and 6.52
× 1018 s–1 when the coverage is
1.5 ML, respectively. Those spectra are analyzed separately, and the
results are shown in Figure S3b–d. First, all the spectra are proved to be of the first kinetic order.
Second, the desorption energy and the pre-exponential factor are calculated
and validated against the input parameters in Table 2. The consistent results agree that the proposed
model is able to deal with the TPD spectrum with coverage-dependent
kinetic parameters.

and the Model Prediction Results for Case V

1	62.5	6.52 × 1018	1	62.16	5.08 × 1018	
Case VI: In this case, as shown in Figure 8a,b, the simulated
TPD spectrum first follows the first order (Ed = 50 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 ×
1015 s–1) from coverage = 1.0 ML. Also,
it later shifts to follow the second order (Ed = 35 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 ×
1010 ML–1·s–1)
when the transient coverage is 0.8249 ML at 160 K. The input spectrum
and its coverage distribution against the temperature (blue solid
line) are depicted in the insets. Thereafter, the input spectrum is
discretized by ΔT = 0.1 K. The ant in the proposed
model consists of 100 nodes, and its moving step is 10 nodes. The
terrace-searching results in Figure 8c clearly show that the spectrum between 47 and 50
cycles, corresponding to the temperature between 147.0 and 159.9 K,
follows the first-order kinetics, while that between 61 and 64 cycles,
corresponding to the temperature between 161.0 and 173.90 K, follows
the second-order kinetics. Besides, the prediction kinetic parameters
are quite consistent with the input values (black dotted line). Therefore,
the ant in the proposed model has powerful flexibility in analyzing
the complex TPD spectrum.

by a first-order spectrum (black) starting from coverage = 1.0 ML
and later shifting to a second-order spectrum (red) when (b) the transient
coverage is 0.8249 ML at 160 K, and (c) the terrace-searching results
by the ant in the proposed model are demonstrated in terms of the
kinetic desorption energy, the pre-exponential factor, and coefficient
of determination.

Case VII: The noise is very common
in the TPD measurement. In this case, an artificial second-order TPD
spectrum (Ed = 50 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 1013 ML–1·s–1) (red) is first generated in Figure 9. Then, three new spectra (blue) in Figure 9a–c are produced
by adding 5, 10, and 15% relative errors to the previous spectrum,
respectively. Meanwhile, another spectrum (blue) in Figure 9d is simulated with a fixed
error range of ±0.001 ML·s–1, which is
randomly added to the spectrum. Without data smooth operation, the
noise-affected spectra are discretized by ΔT = 0.1 K. Then, the 5% relative noise affected spectrum is examined
by the proposed model when the ant’s length has 500 nodes and
its moving step is 10 nodes. For the 10 and 15% relative noise affected
spectra, the ant’s length is optimized to 530 nodes. Since
the fluctuation brought by the noise definitely causes the values
of the nodes to be unstable, the R2 results
accordingly decrease. After 90 cycles, or 190.0 K, the greatest R2 results are reached, and the prediction kinetic
parameters for the 5% relative noise affected spectrum in each cycle
are summarized in Table S2. In contrast,
the main peak in Figure 9d is much less affected by the fixed noise, and the values of R2 are over 0.84 after 81 cycles at 181.0 K,
and the accompanying prediction parameters are summarized in Table S3. All the prediction results are compared
with the input parameters in Table 3. As a result, the proposed model is able to extract
the kinetic parameters from a TPD spectrum with either a relative
or a fixed noise under present simulation conditions.

Case VIII:
In the last case, the experimental TPD spectrum of ammonia adsorbed
at 293 K (initial surface coverage = 100%) by Abello et al.32 is reproduced to further test the proposed model.
The raw data (Table S4) are reproduced
in Figure 10a and
then discretized by ΔT = 1 K. The ant’s
length is optimized to have 50 nodes, and the ant moves by 1 node
in each cycle. The model only predicts the proper desorption energy
distribution under the zero kinetic order, and the results are depicted
in Figure 10b. A quasi-terrace
appears with a relatively steady R2 between
81 and 92 cycles, which correspond to the temperature between 376
and 436 K. Therefore, the average desorption energy is approximately
53.23 kJ·mol–1, which is consistent with the
reported results of 29.26–66.04 kJ·mol–1.32−34

Further Discussion
Discretization
Parameter ΔT
The proposed parameter-free
analysis model is established based on the linear integral function
difference, so the discretization parameter ΔT directly affects the prediction accuracy. Therefore, taking a first-order
kinetic TPD spectrum (Ed = 60 kJ·mol–1, ν = 1 × 1018·s–1) as an example, the kinetic parameters are predicted when ΔT is 0.01, 0.1, and 1 K, respectively. The results are compared
in Table 4. The finer
ΔT generally improves the prediction accuracy
of the desorption energy, while it has a limited impact on the pre-exponential
factor. On the other hand, the finer ΔT does
not only require the accuracy of the experimental measurement but
also requires more computing resources for model prediction. Therefore,
it is better to choose a reasonable discretization parameter by model
optimization.

Noninteger Kinetic
Order
Although the proposed model only shows how to predict
an integer kinetic order of a TPD spectrum in the case studies, in
theory, it can extract a noninteger kinetic order. As a result, the
integral g function difference in eq 4 can be rewritten in a more general
form 9  

Peak-Distinguished Resolution
Peak-distinguished resolution
in a multisite TPD spectrum is of great interest for evaluating the
proposed model. It is worth stressing again that the ant’s
length and its moving step size in the model have a direct and important
effect on the peak-distinguished resolution. For instance, the two-site
spectrum in Case II has a peak–peak overlap region between
155 and 178 K in Figure S4, where the ant
cannot distinguish one from the other. Therefore, it explains why
the extracted kinetic parameters fluctuate a lot in this temperature
range in Figure 5.
As soon as the ant’s entire body has left the overlap region
after about 40 cycles, it continues to follow the defect-site spectrum.
Therefore, the prediction results are stable and form the corresponding
terraces. Also, the spectra overlap regions are located between 147
and 160 K in Cases VI and VIII, between 161 and 174 K in Case VI,
and between 376 and 419 K in Case VIII. Therefore, the custom ants
in these cases usually have a shorter length with fewer nodes to reduce
the errors caused by fluctuations. Briefly, the peak-distinguished
resolution strongly depends on whether the ant’s movement stays
within a nonoverlap region or not. On the other hand, the kinetic
parameters are predicted by the linear fit over all the nodes inside
the custom ant. Therefore, more nodes can produce more reliable results.
Besides, the larger step size can accelerate the ant’s movement
to save the computing time, while the smaller step size can generate
a more significant terrace. To sum up, it is quite difficult to define
the standard parameters of the proposed model, so it is recommended
to carry out optimization work in advance to figure out the most suitable
parameters for a specific case.

Conclusions
A parameter-free analysis model for simultaneously
extracting the kinetic order, the desorption activation energy, and
the pre-exponential factor of a TPD spectrum is established. The innovative
model is feasible in predicting the coverage-independent or -dependent
kinetic parameters under different heating rates. In addition to handling
a monosite TPD spectrum, the model can also separate a multisite spectrum
through a coverage prediction–correction loop method. Besides,
eight case studies on the TPD spectrum prediction are demonstrated,
including but not limited to the spectrum with coverage-dependent
desorption energy, the spectrum with noise, and the practical spectrum,
to help fully understand the principle, the process, and the future
potential of the proposed model. Moreover, the discretization grid
on the prediction accuracy, the noninteger kinetic order prediction,
and the peak-distinguished resolution in a multisite TPD spectrum
analysis are further discussed.
