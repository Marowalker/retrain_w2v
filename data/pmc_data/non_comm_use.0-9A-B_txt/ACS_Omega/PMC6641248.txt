The
present article reports the investigation on the effects
of solvent and position of functionality on various physical properties
of polyurethanes (PUs) based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene
(HTPB). The PU films (curative)  were prepared by coupling HTPB
(P0) with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) in various solvent media.
The PUs obtained in different solvent media displayed similar thermal
profile and glass transition temperature (Tg), but their tensile properties varied significantly. Optimized tensile
properties were observed when tetrahydrofuran was used as the solvent
media. In the course, the investigation of the functionality effect,
tetrazole (M1, M2, and M3) were covalently attached at the terminal
carbon of HTPB to obtain three modified HTPBs (P1, P2, and P3), thereby
coupling with IPDI to obtain the corresponding tetrazole functional
PUs films. Pristine (P0–PU) and functional PU (P1–PU,
P2–PU, and P3–PU) films have similar thermal profile
and Tg (−76 °C), but they
have a notable enhancement in tensile properties; for example, tensile
strength and elongation at break of P0–PU were found to be
3.21 MPa and 727%, respectively, whereas these values were 4.84 MPa
and 958%, respectively, in the case of P3–PU. It was observed
that on increasing the number of methylene group from 1 to 3 between
HTPB and tetrazole moiety, the strength of hydrogen bonding increases,
which facilitates better packing of urethane network in the PU and
hence improves the tensile properties. Also, modification of pristine
HTPB with tetrazole derivatives enhanced the calorific values of the
resulting PUs.

Introduction
Hydroxyl-terminated
polybutadiene (HTPB), an oligomeric diol monomer
cum binder for the preparation of polyurethane (PU) rubber, possesses
peculiar inherent properties such as excellent hydrolytic stability,
low-temperature flexibility, and high solid loading capacity, and
the resulting PU displayed excellent elongation, tensile strength,
and good elastic recovery.1−6 Driven by the above-mentioned properties, HTPB and HTPB-based PU
have been extensively used in membranes, adhesives, coating, packing,
and cushioning applications. In addition, HTPB has become the most
promising binder for oxidizers, metallic fuels, and other additives
in composite propellant application.7−14 In composite propellant, HTPB-based binders not only provide dimensional
stability and structural integrity but also impart outstanding mechanical
properties.

HTPB is an inert prepolymer that contributes nearly
10–15%
mass of the propellant compositions; hence, it has been always an
adventurous task to replace the inert mass by energetic polymers.
Over past few decays, significant numbers of research groups across
the globe have engaged in developing energetic HTPB by introducing
energetic molecules along the backbone without compromising its inherent
physicochemical properties. For instance, to improve the ballistic
performances of composite propellants, HTPB was grafted with poly(glycidyl
azide), poly(3-nitratomethyl-3-methyloxetane), poly(glycidylnitrate),
poly(vinyl nitrates), nitro groups, etc.15−20 In the same direction, recently, we successfully demonstrated the
attachment of some commercially available nitrogen-rich molecules
such as dinitrobenzene, cyanuric chloride, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(dimethylamino)-1,3,5-triazine,
and 1-chloro-3,5-diazido-2,4,6-triazine at the terminal carbons of
HTPB.21−24 On the other hand, for burn rate enhancement, ferrocene25 and its derivatives such as iron pentacarbonyl,26 vinyl ferrocene,27 2-(ferrocenylpropyl)dimethylsilane, etc.28 were grafted covalently to the HTPB backbone. Most of these modifications
demonstrated good energy output but fail to improve the postcured
mechanical properties, processability at higher solid loading, and
compatibility with other ingredients.

On technical aspect, rocket
motors demand adequate mechanical properties
to enable them to withstand the stresses imposed during operation,
handling, transportation, and motor firing. The urethane network obtained
by curing HTPB with a suitable diisocyanate (curative) is the common
technique used for obtaining mechanical stability. A detail literature
survey states that the mechanical properties of polyurethanes (PUs)
are determined by various factors, some of which are discussed here.
Sarkar et al.29 showed that incorporating
lignin in the PU improves their mechanical properties. Santerre et
al.30 demonstrated that amino acid-modified
PUs display better mechanical properties. Zhang et al.31 reported the enhancement in tensile properties
of PU by modifying with hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer and dihydroxyl
propyl-terminated siloxane oligomers. Chung et al.32 discussed the effect of Lewis acid on the mechanical properties
of PUs. Bui et al.33 reported that the
presence of low-volatile solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide in the
polymerization reaction mixture increases the tensile properties of
the PUs. In our latest report,34,35 we observed that the
functionalized HTPB at the terminal carbon with nitrogen-rich molecules
significantly improved the tensile property due to the presence of
strong hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions in the PUs
chain. Although highly appreciated efforts were made by several research
groups for enhancing the tensile properties, there persists a tremendous
challenge to produce HTPB-based PUs where both stress and strain can
be enhanced simultaneously to meet the future requirement for composite
propellant formulation and other advanced applications.

In summary,
mechanical properties of PUs are generally governed
by either modifying the diol or the diisocyanate, or the presence
of organic solvent in the polymerization reaction mixture. Second,
the overall energy content of a polymer is increased by introducing
nitrogen-rich molecules along its backbone. Therefore, integrating
the above-mentioned aspects, in the present report, we targeted to
increase the energy output and improve mechanical properties of PUs.
To achieve our goal, we first explored the effect of solvent on thermal
and mechanical properties of PUs based on HTPB. Our subsequent investigation
was to suitably place the tertazole moiety to have better inter- and
intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Effective interactions will result
better packing of urethane network in the PU matrix, which will be
reflected on the mechanical properties. Also, by incorporating functionality,
we expected to increase the energy output of PU. The above findings
were supported with various spectroscopic techniques and discussed
in details.

Results and Discussion
Nitrogen-rich organic molecules
are environmental benign and have
proved to be the most potential candidates for high energetic material
applications. Tetrazole, nitrogen-rich five-membered heterocyclic
molecules, can be easily synthesized in one pot by reacting sodium
azide with the corresponding nitrile. In the present report, three
homologous tetrazole series (M1, M2, and M3) were synthesized (Scheme 1) and completely
characterized spectroscopically before performing further experiments.
The detailed synthetic protocol and characterization data are presented
in the Experimental Section. The 1H NMR spectra is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra of M1, M2, and M3.

Tetrazoles (M1, M2, and M3)
were then covalently coupled at the
terminal carbon of HTPB (P0) for obtaining the three modified HTPBs
(P1, P2, and P3) (Scheme 2) by using the synthetic procedure given in the Experimental Section. The attachment of tetrazoles with HTPB
was confirmed by changes in various physicochemical properties such
as viscosity, molecular weight, and hydroxyl values, all of which
are summarized in Table 1. Though we noticed a small increase in molecular weight after attachments
of tetrazoles to P0, but we observed a significant decrease in viscosity
and no change in hydroxyl value. The lower viscosity is very much
useful in terms of higher loading capacity of the binder. The decrease
in viscosity may be due to preferential attachment of tetrazoles on
the HTPB microstructure, which possesses a lower viscosity.

polydispersity index (PDI) are obtained from gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) analysis in tetrahydrofuran (THF).

For synthesizing PU, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI),
a readily
commercially available aliphatic diisocyanate, was used as a model
diisocyanate. P0 and IPDI were coupled using catalytic amount of dibutyltin
dilaurate (DBTDL) in various solvent media to obtain P0–PUs.
The progress in polymerization was monitored using Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy by noticing the appearance of urethane
linkage −NH peak (3330 cm–1) and the disappearance
of hydroxyl (3400 cm–1) and isocyanate (2270 cm–1) peaks. Hydroxyl functional solvents such as methanol
or ethanol are nonsolvent for HTPB and some dihydroxyl solvents act
as chain extenders for synthesizing PUs;24 hence, we restricted hydroxyl solvents from our solvent selection.
Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetric
experiments performed on the P0–PU samples obtained in different
solvents media did not show any significant difference in thermal
profile or glass transition temperature (Tg). Hence, with a conclusion that solvents have negligible effect
on the thermal properties of the PUs based on HTPB, we looked into
the effect of solvent on mechanical properties. For mechanical properties,
universal testing machine (UTM) experiments were performed, and we
observed some interesting phenomenon. It was also observed that the
P0–PUs obtained in different solvents have different values
of tensile stress, tensile strain, Young’s modulus, toughness,
and effective cross-linking. Best tensile properties were observed
when THF was used as the solvent medium for polymerization of PU (Table 2). This motivated
us to carry out PU polymerization of modified HTPBs (P1, P2, and P3)
in the THF solvent to obtain PUs (P1–PU, P2–PU, and
P3–PU, respectively) as shown schematically in Scheme 3. The detail reaction procedure
is described in the Experimental Section.

All of the PUs obtained
from pristine HTPB (P0–PU) or modified
HTPBs (P1–PU, P2–PU, and P3–PU) obtained using
THF as the solvent media neither showed any significant deviations
in thermal profile (Figure 2) or in Tg (Figure 3), whereas, a remarkable deviation was noticed
in the tensile properties (Figure 4) and thermomechanical properties. It was observed
that on increasing the methylene group between HTPB and tetrazole
ring, elongation at break (εb), tensile strength
(σb), and storage modulus vary. It is also observed
that, in the case of P3–PU, where HTPB and tetrazole moiety
are apart by three methylene groups, all of the mechanical properties
parameters σb, εb, and storage modulus
were superior as compared to all of the other PUs (Table 2).

In our previous report,24 we successfully
demonstrated that hydrogen bonding governs the simultaneous enhancement
of σb and εb in the case of terminal
functionalized HTPB-based PU. In the present report, we propose that
the strength of hydrogen bonding will be more effective by suitably
placing the nitrogen-rich moiety, which, in turn, influences the packing
of urethane network in the PU matrix and leads to improved mechanical
properties. To support our hypothesis, we performed several characterizations
including FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The incorporation of small amounts of organic molecules or ionic
species into the PU backbone strongly affects the solid-state surface
or the bulk properties. The incorporation results in additional structural
features such as microphase-separated structures and/or phase-separated
segmented polyurethanes. These structural features depend on the molecular
weight, the chemical properties of soft and hard segments, and the
processing environment during curing process to turn in solid state.
Hence, the structural feature influences the final solid state properties
such as tensile properties, elongation, elastomeric character, and
thermal transitions.

Thermal Studies
Thermograms of P0–PU
films obtained
in different solvents (Table 2) did not show any significant difference as shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S1). Even
the thermograms of P0–PU, P1–PU, P2–PU, and P3–PU
were similar in nature, as represented in Figure 2. It shows two-stage degradations, with the
first signs of degradation starting from 260 °C to around 310
°C with less than 12% mass loss, which is quite consistent and
corresponds to the urethane linkage degradation. In the second step,
the process of mass loss, due to the degradation of polymer backbone,
starts at 310 °C. However, at 490 °C, almost 97% of the
total mass degrades.

Because thermal stability (Figure 2) did not reveal any significant
differences in PUs, we decided to investigate the solvent effect on
the glass transition temperature (Tg)
of the PUs, which provides better insights into the segmental mixing
and microphase separation. For measuring Tg, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed
under nitrogen atmosphere using a temperature ramp from −100
to 50 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. All of the five
P0–PUs samples (obtained in different solvent media as shown
in Table 2) have Tg value at −76.0 °C as shown in
the Supporting Information (Figure S2).
The Tg values of P(0–3)–PUs
are also obtained approximately at −76.0 °C (Figure 3) and are in well
agreement with earlier reported values in literature.26 Hence, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and DSC studies
conclude that neither solvent nor functionalization of HTPB affects
the thermal stability or segmental motion of PUs based on HTPB.

Mechanical Properties
Mechanical property (tensile)
is the most remarkable and crucial property of elastomeric PUs that
decides the type of applications of PUs. Hence, several research groups
across the globe have been engaged to find a method to control the
tensile property of the PU materials. Tensile strength (σb) and elongation at break (εb) obtained from
stress vs strain plots predict the overall mechanical properties of
an elastomer. There are multiple ways by which either σb or εb can be enhanced. For instant, stoichiometric
imbalance between the diisocyanate (−NCO) and diol (−OH)
often results in the enhancement of σb; on the other
hand, increasing the soft segment or decreasing the hard segment results
in a higher εb.36,37 Generally,
on increasing the mole ratio (r) of −NCO/–OH,
σb increases and εb decreases.29,37 Hence, there is always a great degree of challenge in finding a
way to simultaneously increase σb and εb in the PU materials. A clear picture of tensile properties
of P(0–3)–PU can be realized from the data shown in Table 2. σb and εb values were obtained from stress vs strain
plot as shown in Figure 4 and are tabulated along with toughness, Young’s modulus (E), and effective cross-linking (N).

We investigated the effect of solvent (which is used to make PU)
on the tensile properties of the PUs, for which we considered nonpolar
solvents such as hexane and toluene (entries 1 and 2 of Table 2) and polar solvents such as
dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dioxane (entries
3–5 of Table 2). The most interesting observation is that solvents such as tetrahydrofuran
and dioxane imparted much higher εb values when compared
to rest of the solvents, but both σb and εb simultaneously and significantly increased in tetrahydrofuran
(Figure 4A). Hence,
it was preferred to synthesize PUs of the modified HTPBs (P1, P2,
and P3) using THF as the solvent. Figure 4B represents the stress–strain plot
of P0–PU, P1–PU, P2–PU, and P3–PU obtained
using THF as the solvent; it was noticed that by increasing the methylene
group between HTPB and tetrazole ring, the tensile properties such
as σb, εb, toughness, Young’s
modulus, and effective cross-linking vary. Stress–strain plot
clearly proves that the PU obtained from tetrazole-modified HTPBs
(P(1–3)–PU) displayed better tensile properties as compared
to P0–PU, the comprehensive data are provided in Table 2. Enhanced tensile property
in PUs based on tetrazole-modified HTPBs resulted due to stronger
hydrogen-bonding interactions, which lead to better packing of the
urethane network in the PU matrix. Our hypothesis is further conformed
with FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM cross-sectional images and discussed
in detail in the following sections.

Dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) is a thermomechanical analysis
technique and used to characterize the rheological properties of PUs
by subjecting PUs to periodic loading under a specific range of temperatures.
In DMA, a sinusoidal stress is applied and the resultant strain is
measured. Properties measured under this oscillating loading are storage
modulus (E′), which represents the stiffness
of the material and is proportional to the energy stored during a
loading cycle, and tan δ, referred to as the mechanical
damping. Figure 5A
represents the storage modulus (E′) as a function
of temperature for P(0–3)–PUs. Storage modulus values
for all the four PUs at −100 °C are in the range of 2.4–1.4
GPa and decrease with increase in temperature. At −60 °C,
the storage modulus values for all the four PUs are in the range of
0.045–0.025 GPa, indicating the rubbery state of PUs. At −100
°C, P3–PU displayed the highest storage modulus (2.4 GPa),
whereas P1–PU (1.45 GPa) had the lowest value among the four
PUs. The decreasing order of storage modulus of all the four PUs is
P3–PU, P0–PU, P2–PU, and P1–PU. Figure 5B presents the tan δ
curves as a function of temperature for P(0–3)–PUs.
The tan δ peak height of P1–PU is 0.92 at −70
°C, that of P2–PU and P3–PU is 0.78 at −60
°C, and that of P0–PU is 0.87 at −60 °C. This
signifies that the Tg values of P1–PU
is −70 °C and that of P0–PU, P2–PU, and
P3–PU are −60 °C.

Spectroscopic and Morphological Studies of PUs
The
formation of urethanes in P(0–3)–PUs was confirmed by
the appearance of −NH vibration at 3365 and 3335 cm–1 for P0–PU and P(1–3)–PUs, respectively in FT-IR
spectra (Supporting Information, Figure S3). A 30 cm–1 shift in the −NH vibration
in P(1–3)–PUs as compared to P0–PU indicates
a stronger N–H bond in P(1–3)–PU due to the presence
intramolecular interactions. A detail analysis of the vibrational
frequency region between 1760 and 1680 cm–1 corresponding
to carbonyl (C=O) group reveals valuable information for understanding
the strength of hydrogen bonds.38−41 Wilkes and co-worker38 demonstrated that the presence of medium to strong hydrogen bonding
in the PUs based on IPDI displays sharp peaks at 1695 and 1685 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectroscopy. Figure 6 presents the FT-IR spectra of P(0–3)–PUs
films between 1760 and 1680 cm–1. It is observed
that all the four PUs displayed peaks at 1715 cm–1, which corresponds to free carbonyl group, and 1695 cm–1, which represents the carbonyl groups involved in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding. However, the peak at 1685 cm–1 is absent in P0–PU because P0–PU structurally lacks
any short intramolecular hydrogen bonding as shown schematically in Scheme 4.

P1–PU, P2–PU, and
P3–PU films.

Scheme 4 Schematic Representation
of Hydrogen-Bonding Interactions among PU
Domains
When the tetrazole
moiety and HTPB chain are separated by one methylene
group as in the case of P1–PU case, there is only one possible
way of forming intramolecular bonding between the hydrogen atom of
tertrazole moiety and the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group (represented
using a rectangular box in Scheme 4). However, when the tetrazole moiety and HTPB chain are separated by three
flexible methylene group (indicated using a square box in Scheme 4) as in P3–PU,
there are two possible ways of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonding.
Strength of  intramolecular hydrogen-bonding in P2–PU
will behave as an intermediate strength of P1–PU and P3–PU.
Hence, the vibrational frequency at 1695 cm–1 (corresponding
to intermolecular hydrogen bonding) is observed in all the four PUs
among the domains in the PU matrix and 1685 cm–1 peak (corresponding to intramolecular hydrogen bonding) does not
appear in P0–PU and the sharpness of the peak increases with
increasing strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding, reaching
highest in the case of P3–PU. Therefore, the strength of hydrogen
bonding will govern the orientations of urethane network in the PU
matrix and will follow the order P3–PU > P2–PU >
P1–PU
> P0–PU, further confirmed using cross-sectional morphological
studies as discussed below.

The FT-IR analysis of the PU films
suggests an increase in the
strength of hydrogen bonding, which may influence the packing of urethane
network in the PU matrix. Hence, to confirm our conjecture, we have
performed field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) experiment
by recoding the images of the frozen fracture cross section of PU
films. Figure 7 represents
the FESEM images of 10 μm scale of all the four PUs. The presence
of morphological difference is clearly visible, with increase in flexible
methylene groups between tetrazole moiety and HTPB backbone resulting
in increase in the strength of hydrogen bonding in PU matrix, which,
in turn, results in a well-ordered packing pattern. It is clearly
seen from the images in Figure 7 that the strength of hydrogen bond is maximum for P3–PU
as compared to rest of the three PU films, formed a well ordered arrangement
of PU domains which keep on diminishing as we move to P2–PU
and then P1–PU while P0–PU shows no such features. Hence,
FT-IR and morphological studies clearly attributed the stronger packing
in the case of P3–PU which helps in resulting better tensile
properties as discussed in earlier section.

Calorimetric Study
The overall energy content of the
samples was measured using oxygen bomb adiabatic calorimeter by combusting
the samples in the presence of oxygen in a sealed bomb. Oxygen bomb
calorimetric measurements were performed on pristine and modified
HTPB (P0, P1, P2, and P3), as well as the corresponding PU films (P0–PU,
P1–PU, P2–PU, and P3–PU). Each sample was performed
three times and its average was taken. The gross heat of combustion
was measured according to procedures outlined in ASTM D2382-8830. Table 3 summarizes these
test result values of energy content. The measured heat of combustion
for HTPB is in agreement with the published values.42 Tetrazole-modified HTPBs (P(1–3)) have higher heat
of combustion values as compared to pristine HTPB (P0), confirming
the attachment of tetrazoles by replacing the hydrogen of the terminal
carbon of HTPB. Because nitrogen-rich molecules tend to be energetic
materials and the increasing order of nitrogen percentage in tetrazole
molecules is M1 > M2 > M3, which reflected an increasing value
of
heat of combustion in the order P1 > P2 > P3. Similar trend
was observed
even with the PU obtained from HTPB (P0–PU) and modified HTPBs
[P(1–3)–PU].

Conclusions
In conclusion, three
homologous series of tetrazole molecules have
been synthesized and successfully coupled at the terminal carbons
of HTPB. Modification of HTPB with tertazoles at the terminal carbon
has displayed an increase in energy content without altering the physicochemical
properties. HTPB and modified HTPBs were coupled with IPDI in various
organic solvents to obtain the respective PUs. It has been observed
that solvents played a negligible role in the thermal profile or Tg, but they remarkably affect the tensile properties.
Optimized tensile properties have been obtained when THF was used
as the solvent media for polymerization. In modified HTPBs, on increasing
the methylene group between the tetrazole and HTPB, the strength of
hydrogen bonding increases, leading to better packing of the urethane
network in the PU matrix and hence displaying significant enhancement
in mechanical properties.

(13 g, 200 mmol) was added in portions and the mixture heated to 60–65
°C over a period of 2 h and cooled to room temperature. Chloroalkylnitrile
(66.66 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was refluxed
for 24–28 h (Scheme 1). The progress of the reaction was monitored by thin-layer
chromatography following the disappearance of chloroalkylnitrile.
The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the
solvent distilled off. The residue was treated with dilute hydrochloric
acid (pH 2), and the mixture was repeatedly extracted with ethyl acetate.
The extract was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography
using hexane-ethyl acetate. 1H NMR spectra of M1, M2, and
M3 are shown in Figure 1. 13C NMR spectra of M1, M2, and M3 are presented in Figures S4–S6.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Tetrazole-Functionalized
HTPB: P(1–3)
Modified HTPBs were obtained by attaching
the 5-(chloroalkyl)-1H-tetrazole M(1–3) at
the terminal carbon of HTPB to obtain HTPB-M1 (P1), HTPB-M2 (P2),
and HTPB-M3 (P3), respectively, as shown in Scheme 2. For the modification of HTPB, we adapted
our previously reported procedure.24 The
brief procedure for the synthesis of HTPB-tetrazole is as follows:
HTPB (1 mmol) was taken in a three-neck round-bottom flask under nitrogen
atmosphere and dissolved in anhydrous THF and stirred at room temperature
for 20 min. To this, sodium hydride (NaH) (2.5 mmol) was added and
stirred for 10 min, followed by the addition of 5-(chloroalkyl)-1H-tetrazole (2.5 mmol) and continuous stirring at room temperature
for the next 24 h. Then, the liquid layer was decanted off and the
solvent evaporated under vacuum. The reaction mixture was washed thoroughly
with methanol to remove the unreacted monomers and dried over vacuum.
It was observed that modified HTPBs P(1–3) were less viscous
as compared to pristine HTPB (P0), but the viscosity of the modified
HTPBs increased with increase in the methylene groups between tetrazole
moiety and HTPB. The physical characteristics of the resultant modified
HTPBs P(1–3) along with P0 are listed in Table 1. The 1H NMR spectra of P0, P1,
M2, and M3 are shown in Figure S7.

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Polyurethanes
In a two-neck
round-bottom flask, prepolymer (P(0–3)) (1.0
mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of anhydrous THF at room temperature
under continuous flow. To this, calculated mole amount (maintaining
the ratio of −NCO/–OH at 1:1, based on equivalents calculated
from the hydroxyl values of prepolymers) of diisocyanates (IPDI) was
added and the mixture stirred for 30 min at room temperature for homogeneous
mixing. The polymerization was triggered by adding catalytic amount
of DBTDL and stirred for next 3 h. The progress of the polymerization
was monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy till the peak at 2270 cm–1 disappeared (corresponding to isocyanate). A homogeneous viscous
solution obtained was then transferred to a Petri dish (precoated
with silicone-releasing agent) for curing at 60 °C for 120 h
to obtain free-standing films (P0–PU, P1–PU, P2–PU,
and P3–PU) as shown in Scheme 3.

Characterization Techniques
Spectroscopic
Analysis
1H NMR and 13C NMR for M(1–3)
were recorded using 400 MHz NMR (Bruker)
spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded using HRMS
Maxis (Bruker). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured
at ambient condition in both transmittance and absorbance mode at
a wavenumber ranges 4000–600 cm–1 using a
FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet 5700).

Determination of Molecular
Weight
Gel permeation chromatography
(GPC, Waters 515 HPLC) connected with a RI detector (Waters 2414)
was used for determining the molecular weights of P(0–3) using
THF (HPLC grade) as the mobile phase. Narrow molecular weight distribution
polystyrene standards (Polymer Standards Service) with the polydispersity
index ≤1.1 were used for calibration before the GPC molecular
weight measurement of P(0–3). The samples were prepared to
an approximate concentration of 3.0 mg/mL and injected in GPC column
(Styragel HR2 THF) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.

Determination
of Hydroxyl Value and Viscosity
The hydroxyl
values of P(0–3) were determined by acetylation method, which
involves the replacement of the hydrogen on a hydroxyl group of HTPB
by acetyl group. Viscosity measurements were performed using Rotoviscometer
(Rheolab QC-180) with the measuring system CC10, connected to a temperature
controller (Anton Paar). Viscosities were measured the over shear
rate of 100–300 s–1 at 30 °C.

Bomb
Calorimetry
The heat of combustion of P(0–3)
and P(0–3)–PU was determined using a Parr (series 1425)
semi-micro-oxygen bomb calorimeter. The substances were burned in
an oxygen atmosphere at a pressure of 3.04 MPa. Before performing
the experiment, the instrument was calibrated with standard reference
sample of benzoic acid (SRM 39i, NIST). Because a Parr 45C10 alloy
fuse wire was used, a correction of 2.3 (IT) cal/cm of wire burned
has been applied in all of the standardization and calorific value
determinations. After performing the experiment, the bomb was examined
for evidence of unburned substance after each run; if any traces of
substance were found, the run was discarded.

Mechanical Studies
Thermomechanical properties of the
PU films were analyzed using a dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA, TA
Instruments Q-800) fitted with a film tension clamp. The temperature
range was varied from −100 to 50 °C with a ramping rate
of 3 °C/min at a frequency of 1 Hz. No preheating cycle was applied.
The storage modulus and tan δ were recorded as a function
of temperature. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined from the position of the maximum (peak)
on the tan δ vs temperature plot. For the DMA analysis,
the specimens were cut to rectangular dimension (10 × 4 ×
0.5 mm3). The tensile strength measurements (stress–strain
relationship) were performed at ambient condition using universal
testing machine (5965-5 kN, Instron) using a strain rate of 1 mm/min.
Dumb-bell-shaped specimens were cut following the ASTM standard D653
(Type V specimen).

Microscopic Study
The cross-sectional
morphology of
the PU samples was recorded using a field emission scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss ultra55 model) instrument operated
at 5 kV. The films were dipped in liquid nitrogen and then fractured
to keep the structure intact, followed by placing the fractured portion
vertically in the SEM sample holder. The samples were coated with
gold before capturing the SEM images.

Thermal Studies
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
performed under nitrogen atmosphere in a TA Q600SDT TG-DTA instrument
in the temperature range of 30–700 °C with a heating of
10 °C/min. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements
were performed with a Mettler-Toledo DSC-2C instrument equipped with
a liquid nitrogen subambient accessory. To ensure reproducibility,
the liquid nitrogen reservoir was filled 2 h before calibration and
maintained approximately three-fourths level throughout the measurement.
The temperature scale was calibrated against mercury (234.28 K) and
indium (429.78 K) at a scan rate of 5 °C/min. The samples were
scanned from −100 to 40 °C.
