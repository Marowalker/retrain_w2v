A series of fifteen 2-tetrazolylmethyl-isoindolin-1-one
linked-type
bis-heterocycles were synthesized in 10–76% yields under mild
conditions via a one-pot Ugi-azide/(N-acylation/exo-Diels–Alder)/dehydration process from furan-2-ylmethanamine,
aldehydes, isocyanides, azidotrimethylsilane, and maleic anhydride.
Density functional theory calculations were performed using the polarizable

over eight possible pathways. An anthracene-containing analogue displayed
a distribution of its highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital throughout both cyclic moieties.

Introduction
Isoindolin-1-one (oxoisoindoline)
is the core of various natural
and synthetic drugs,1 for example, pagoclone
(antianxiolytic)2 and lenalidomide (anticancer)3 (Figure 1a). Additionally, 1,5-disubstituted tetrazoles (1,5-DS-T)
are bioisosteres of the cis-amide bond of peptides,4,5 which are present in various drugs,6 such
as latamoxeb (antibiotic)7 (Figure 1b). Moreover, 1,5-DS-T’s
have been used as MOF precursors, ligands, and chelating agents.8

Figure 1 Isoinsolin-1-one- and 1,5-DS-T-containing bioactive products.

There are reports describing the
multistep synthesis of isoindolin-1-ones,
in which the key process was a cyclization to construct their five-membered
rings.9−12 Moreover, there is a multistep method for the synthesis of various
(±)-nuevamine-like alkaloids, in which the benzene ring of isoindolin-1-one
was synthesized via intermolecular Diels–Alder (DA) cycloaddition
using maleic anhydride as a dienophile.13 On the other hand, multicomponent reaction (MCR)-based methodologies
for the synthesis of a series of isoindolin-1-ones have been reported.14−16 In addition, there are four reports describing the synthesis of
isoindolin-1-ones via one-pot (MCR/intramolecular DA cycloaddition)
processes.17−20 However, in all of these reports, the substituents (decoration)
of isoindolin-1-ones are structurally simple (alkyl or aryl groups).
Besides, there are only two reported methods describing MCR one-pot
synthesis of isoindolin-1-ones N-bound (not N-linked) with other heterocyclic
systems.21,22

1,5-DS-T’s are synthesized
via click reactions using organic
azides and nitriles as starting reagents.23 Besides, the Ugi-azide reaction is the current strategy to synthesize
1,5-DS-T’s with a structural variety of substituents,24 for example, alkyl, aryl, benzyl, allyl, and
propargyl, and has been less explored with heterocycles in a fused,
linked, merged, or bound manner.25 There
are only two reported methods describing MCR one-pot synthesis of
bis-heterocycles containing a 1,5-DS-T core C-linked with other heterocycles.26,27 In this context, we have recently reported MCR one-pot methods for
the synthesis of a series of novel 1,5-DT’s linked with a variety
of heterocyclic moieties.28−31

There are no reports describing the synthesis
of unsymmetrical
bis-heterocycles containing an isoindolin-1-one core N-linked with
1,5-DS-T’s using MCR one-pot methodologies or multistep methods.
However, Marcaccini reported the synthesis of bis-heterocycles having
an isoindolin-1-one core bound with 1,5-DS-T’s, but at the
C-3 position, using a two-step Ugi-azide/lactamization process (Scheme 1a).32 Besides, we reported the synthesis of fused-type bis-heterocycles
tetrahydroisoquinolin-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-ones
(aza-analogues of isoindolin-1-ones) by a three-step (Ugi-3CR/aza
DA/N-acylation/aromatization)/S-oxidation/Pummerer
process (Scheme 1b).33 Thus, we now describe, for the first time, MCR
one-pot synthesis of 2-tetrazolylmethyl-isoindolin-1-ones N-linked
with a 1,5-DS-T moiety (Scheme 1c), as well as density functional theory (DFT)-based computational
calculations to propose the most plausible reaction mechanism. As
will be discussed, we synthesized novel bis-heterocycles using a new
combination of known reactions, that is, the Ugi-azide reaction,34 DA cycloaddition (from furan derivatives),35 and aromatization (from oxa-bridged intermediates).36−39 It is noteworthy that Ivar Ugi, Emmanuel Gras, and
Jieping Zhu are the pioneers behind these processes, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Strategies
Results and Discussion
2-((1-Cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl)-3-oxoisoindoline-4-carboxylic
acid (1a) was selected as a model for screening reaction
conditions (Table 1). Thus, equimolar amounts of furan-2-ylmethanamine (2), p-anisaldehyde (3a), azidotrimethylsilane
(4), and cyclohexyl isocyanide (5a) were
combined sequentially under the Ugi-azide standard conditions (MeOH
[1.0 M], room temperature (rt)) as the starting point. Ugi-azide product 6a was synthesized in 99% yield after 24 h (entry 1, Table 1). Then, to avoid
the use of a solvent because the majority of the reagents are liquids,
the reaction was performed under neat conditions. The yield decreased
dramatically to 22% after 24 h (entry 2, Table 1). To reduce the reaction time, two further
experiments were conducted at 65 °C under conventional or microwave
(MW) heating conditions, but the yields obtained were 84% (1 h) and
88% (0.2 h), respectively (entries 3 and 4, Table 1). Finally, an experiment was performed using
ultrasound (US) irradiation (sonication), providing a yield of 90%
after 2 h (entry 5, Table 1). Then, we performed an intermolecular DA cycloaddition at
rt using equimolar amounts of the Ugi-azide product, 6a, and maleic anhydride (7) in anhydrous PhMe as a solvent.
Compound 8a was synthesized first in 60% yield after
4 h (entry 6, Table 1). A further experiment was performed increasing the amount of 7 to 1.5 equiv, producing 87% yield after 4 h (entry 7, Table 1). Two further experiments
were performed at 110 °C under conventional or MW heating conditions,40 but the yields obtained decreased to 68% (1
h) and 65% (0.2 h), respectively (entries 8 and 9, Table 1). A final experiment was performed
using US, producing a yield of 72% in 1 h (entry 10, Table 1). To aromatize the six-membered
ring, compound 8a was heated in acidic media.41 Thus, an aqueous solution of compound 8a in H3PO4 [85%] was refluxed, but
the bis-heterocycle, 1a, could not been synthesized (entry
11, Table 1). In fact,
decomposition was observed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Then,
the aromatization process was performed at 110 °C using PhMe
as a solvent and 1.0 equiv of p-toluenesulfonic acid
(PTSA), producing a yield of 18% after 12 h (entry 12, Table 1). Four additional experiments
were conducted using MW as a heat source by varying the amount of
PTSA. The yields were 25% (1.0 equiv 7), 50% (2.0 equiv 7), 76% (3.0 equiv 7), and 72% (4.0 equiv 7; entries 13–16, Table 1). A further experiment was performed using US, but
the yield decreased to 62% (entry 17, Table 1). Thus, entries 1, 7, and 15 of Table 1 show the optimal
conditions for the three processes. At this point, we hypothesized
that product 1a could be synthesized coupling the three
processes in a one-pot manner. Thus, 1a was synthesized
in 53% overall yield after 29 h (entry 18, Table 1). A further experiment was conducted using
US at 60 °C in a one-pot manner. However, the last step (8a → 1a) did not proceed. As seen, US
works well stepwise but not in the one-pot process.

e One-pot process.

Using optimal conditions, we synthesized the series of novel unsymmetrical
bis-heterocycles, 1a–o, in a one-pot manner using
a combinatorial synthesis approach (Table 2). The scope of the substrate was evaluated
using aldehydes and isocyanides of aliphatic and aromatic nature.
The highest yield was observed for compound 1m (76%),
which contains 4-methoxyphenyl and cyclohexyl as substituents at R1 and R2 positions, respectively. Adequate crystals
for X-ray analysis of compound 1m (CCDC: 1503770) were
obtained. Besides, the lowest yield was observed for the compound 1f (12%), which contains 4-chlorophenyl and 2,6-dimethylphenyl
as substituents at R1 and R2 positions, respectively.
In fact, 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide derivatives were synthesized
in lower yields (12–30%) with respect to alkyl isocyanide derivatives
(32–76%). This behavior can be attributed to the low nucleophilicity
of aryl isocyanides with respect to that of their alkyl-containing
analogues. Thus, modest-to-good overall yields were found (12–76%).

With regard
to the reaction mechanisms, the mechanism for the Ugi-azide
reaction has been documented.42 However,
there are no mechanistic
studies to understand the reaction between furan-2-ylmethanamines
and maleic anhydride to construct the isoindolin-1-one core because,
as can be envisaged, there are eight possible reaction pathways. Ugi-azide
products 6 react with maleic anhydride (7) via either an N-acylation step to give intermediates 10 or a DA reaction that leads to the formation of cycloadducts 9 (endo or exo). These latter intermediates may undergo an
N-acylation to produce compounds 8.
However, as will be discussed, this pathway is not kinetically favored.
Later, intermediates 10 can undergo a DA reaction to
form cycloadducts 8 (endo or exo). Then, compounds 8 can follow two reaction pathways. The first one involves
a decarboxylation process to get intermediates 12 and
further dehydration giving bis-heterocycles 13. However,
all of the attempts toward their synthesis were unsuccessful. On the
other hand, compounds 8 can be protonated by PTSA to
give intermediates 11, which then undergo a dehydration
process leading to formation of carboxylic acid-containing products 1 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Reaction Mechanism
In this context, DFT calculations were performed using
the robust
PCM (toluene)-M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d)//M06-2X-D3/6-31G(d) level of theory
to get all of the energy profiles (see the Supporting Information for computational details, Cartesian coordinates,
energy profiles, and peripheral discussion). Thus, we decided to start
the study taking product 1m as a model because its X-ray
data were available to construct a structure similar to its minimal-energy
conformation. Then, from our theoretical calculations, we found that
the Ugi-azide reaction is followed by an N-acylation/exo-DA/dehydration process (pathway: 6m + 7 → 10m → 8m(exo) → 11m → 1m) (Scheme 2).

We have recently reported the reaction mechanism to construct a
pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-one core (present in a variety
of (±)-nuevamine, (±)-lennoxamine, and magallanesine-like
aza-analogues) from 5-aminooxazoles and maleic anhydride, finding
that these reactions occur in an opposite direction (cycloaddition
before N-acylation).43 This is because pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-ones are
aza-analogues of the isoindolin-1-ones and the nitrogen of their pyridine
ring plays a major role in deprotonation of the carboxylic acid moiety
and hence decarboxylation of the aromatic system. Our findings can
also explain the results published by Trivedi and Salunkhe a few years
ago.44 Various isoindolin-1-ones (advanced
intermediates of the (±)-lennoxamine alkaloid) retaining the
carboxylic acid moiety were synthesized.

It is noteworthy that our
process does not obey Alder’s rule because intermediate 8m(endo) has an energy that is 9.6
kcal/mol higher than that of 8m(exo), which can be attributed to steric strain.

Finally,
it is important to mention that our interest behind the
synthesis of anthracene-containing products 1j–l lies in their potential applications in optics.45,46 As a matter of fact, the application of various anthracene-containing
bis-heterocycles for bioimaging has been reported.47 Thus, computational calculations were performed by means
of time-dependent (TD)-DFT using the tHCTHhyb/6-311g(d) level of theory
for exploring the theoretical–photophysical properties of product 1j. Interestingly, we found an energy gap of 3.07 eV and two
absorption bands at 449 and 403 nm. However, we noticed that the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of 1j is fully distributed
on its anthracene system, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) is located mostly on the isoindolin-1-one system, in
contrast to other experimentally obtained products, probably due to
an effective π–π* electron transfer throughout
the bis-heterocyclic system (see the Supporting Information for further details). This latter behavior suggests
that product 1j may show luminescent properties. In the
same context, it may find application in optics and electronics.

In conclusion, the sustainable methodology described herein is
the first MCR one-pot synthesis of bis-heterocycles containing isoindolin-1-one
and 1,5-DS-T moieties in a linked manner. Both rings of isoindolin-1-one
core and even the tetrazole ring were constructed in one experimental
procedure, whereas other methods reported involve a cyclization step
toward only one ring at a time, γ-lactam or 1,5-DS-T. Therefore,
considering the molecular complexity of products 1a–o and the numbers of bonds (9) and rings (3) formed in one experimental
procedure, and that only two molecules of water were formed as byproducts,
the overall yields obtained were reasonably good. This work is a contribution
to the synthesis of linked-type unsymmetrical bis-heterocycles using
Ugi-azide one-pot processes. DFT-based computational calculations
gave us enough elements to propose the most plausible reaction mechanism
among eight possible ones, which involves an Ugi-azide/(N-acylation/exo-DA)/dehydration sequence as the most
thermodynamic and kinetically favored pathway. An anthracene-containing
analogue displayed a very interesting distribution of HOMO–LUMO
frontier orbitals throughout both of its cyclic moieties, which probably
can be attributed to effective electron transfer.

Experimental
Section
General Information
1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a 500 MHz spectrometer. The solvent
for the NMR samples was CDCl3. Chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million (δ/ppm). The internal reference for the
NMR spectra is tetramethylsilane at 0.00 ppm. Coupling constants are
reported in hertz (J/Hz). Multiplicities of the signals
are reported using standard abbreviations: singlet (s), doublet (d),
triplet (t), quartet (q), and multiplet (m). IR spectra were recorded
by the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method, using neat compounds.
The wavelengths are reported in reciprocal centimeters (νmax/cm–1). High-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) spectra were acquired via electrospray ionization ESI (+) and
recorded via the time-of-flight (TOF) method. Reactions at reflux
were performed in round-bottomed flasks, using a recirculation system
mounted on a sand bath, with an electronic temperature control. MW-assisted
reactions were performed in sealed vials in a closed-vessel mode,
using a monomodal MW reactor without a pressure sensor. US-irradiated
reactions were performed in sealed vials placed in a water bath of
a sonicator cleaner working at frequencies of 42 kHz ± 6%. The
reaction progress was monitored by TLC, and the spots were visualized
under UV light (254 or 365 nm). Flash column chromatography was performed
using silica gel (230–400 mesh) and mixtures in different proportions
of hexanes, with ethyl acetate as mobile phase. Melting points were
determined on a Fisher–Johns apparatus and were uncorrected.
The purity degree
was documented qualitatively for each product, with copies of all 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Commercially available reagents
were used without further purification. The solvents were distilled
and dried according to standard procedures.

Product 6a
In
a round-bottomed flask (10 mL) containing a solution of furan-2-ylmethanamine
(0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in anhydrous MeOH [1.0 M] under a nitrogen atmosphere
were added sequentially the corresponding aldehyde (0.5 mmol, 1.0
equiv), isocyanide (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and azidotrimethylsilane
(0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The flask was closed, and the reaction mixture
was stirred for 24 h at rt. Then, the solvent was removed until dryness
and the crude was purified by silica-gel column chromatography using
a mixture of hexane with AcOEt (7/3; v/v) to afford the Ugi-azide
product, 6a.

Procedure to Synthesize the Product 8a
In a round-bottomed flask (10 mL) containing a
solution of compound 6a (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in anhydrous
PhMe [0.5 M] under a
nitrogen atmosphere was added maleic anhydride (1.5 equiv). The flask
was closed and the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at rt. Then,
the solvent was removed until dryness and the crude was purified by
silica-gel column chromatography using a mixture of hexanes with ethyl
acetate (7/3; v/v) to afford the oxa-bridged compound, 8a.

Procedure to Synthesize the Product 1a
In a vial (10 mL) containing a solution of compound 8a (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in anhydrous PhMe [0.2 M] under nitrogen atmosphere
was added PTSA (3.0 equiv) at rt. The vial was closed, and the reaction
mixture was MW-heated at 110 °C (100 W) for 1 h, and the solvent
was removed until dryness. Then, the crude product was purified by
silica-gel column chromatography using a mixture of hexanes with ethyl
acetate (7/3, v/v) to afford the final bis-heterocyclic product, 1a.

One-Pot Synthesis of Products 1a–o
In a vial (10 mL) containing a solution of furan-2-ylmethanamine
(0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in anhydrous MeOH [1.0 M] under a nitrogen atmosphere
were added sequentially the corresponding aldehyde (0.5 mmol, 1.0
equiv), isocyanide (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and azidotrimethylsilane
(0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The vial was closed, and the reaction mixture
was stirred for 24 h at rt. Then, the solvent was removed until dryness
and the crude was dissolved in anhydrous PhMe [0.5 M]. Following this,
maleic anhydride (1.5 equiv) was added. The vial was closed, and the
reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at rt. Then, anhydrous PhMe was
added to dilute the reaction mixture to 0.2 M with respect to the
starting aldehyde. Later, PTSA (3.0 equiv) was added. The vial was
closed, and the new reaction mixture was MW-heated at 110 °C
(100 W) for 1 h. Then, the solvent was removed until dryness. The
crude product was purified by silica-gel column chromatography using
a mixture of hexanes with ethyl acetate (7/3; v/v) to afford the 2-tetrazolylmethyl-isoindolin-1-ones, 1a–o.
