Topoisomerases are important complex
enzymes that modulate DNA
topology to maintain chromosome superstructure and integrity. These
enzymes are involved in many cellular processes that resolve specific
DNA superstructures and intermediates. The low abundance combined
with the biological heterogeneity of relevant intermediates of topoisomerases
makes their structural information not readily accessible using traditional
structural biology tools (e.g., NMR and X-ray crystallography). In
the present work, a second-generation trapped ion mobility spectrometry–mass
spectrometry (TIMS–MS) was used to study Escherichia
coli topoisomerase IA (EcTopIA) and variola virus topoisomerase IB (vTopIB) as well as their complexes with
a single-stranded DNA and a stem-loop DNA under native conditions.
The higher trapping efficiency and extended mass range of the new,
convex TIMS geometry allowed for the separation and identification
of multiple conformational states for the two topoisomerases and their
DNA complexes. Inspection of the conformational space of EcTopIA and
vTopIB in complex with DNA showed that upon DNA binding, the number
of conformational states is significantly reduced, suggesting that
the DNA binding selects for a narrow range of conformers restricted
by the interaction with the DNA substrate. The large microheterogeneity
observed for the two DNA binding proteins suggests that they can have
multiple biological functions. This work highlights the potential
of TIMS–MS for the structural investigations of intrinsically
disordered proteins (e.g., DNA binding proteins) as a way to gain
a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in DNA substrate
recognition, binding, and assembly of the catalytically active enzyme–DNA
complex.

1 Introduction
DNA
topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes present in every organism
that manage and control DNA topology by releasing torsional stress
from supercoiled DNA during replication and transcription.1 The level of DNA supercoiling has substantial
implications in essential cellular functions, making the study of
topoisomerases and DNA topological problems during various cellular
transactions of great biological importance.2,3 Previous
work has also shown bacterial topoisomerase I as an attractive antibiotic
drug target because of their importance in bacterial growth and low
homology with other human topoisomerases.4 Moreover, the unlinking of DNA strands by topoisomerases is not
a single-step process; it involves multiple intermediates.5 A main roadblock of the investigation of these
intermediates is the lack of a spectrum of relevant three-dimensional
structures for the topoisomerases and their DNA-bound forms. Under
the protein folding problem,6 proteins
do not necessarily have a unique ground state (folded state or native
structure) representing a single free-energy minimum but rather a
distribution of ground states with the same energy. This is typically
known as a conformational space or distribution, where each conformation
can be described as a microstate. The distribution of microstates
is related to the protein function. Protein ″free-energy conformational
landscape″ can be extremely rugged; proteins might often be
found in metastable states (i.e., partial energy minima low-lying
state), where they are unable to reach the true ground state without
climbing over a large energy barrier.

The biological heterogeneity
of conformations for topoisomerases
and their DNA-bound forms makes their structural information not readily
accessible using traditional structural biology tools, such as nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. In the past, these
techniques have been limited to the description of subdomains or DNA-bound
subdomains.7−10 Hence, the development of alternative analytical tools able to describe
the biological heterogeneity of conformations for topoisomerases and
their DNA-bound forms is essential for investigating their multistep
mechanisms consisting of DNA binding, cleavage, and strand religation.

Native mass spectrometry (MS), and more recently, in combination
with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), can provide unique insights
in structural biology for the description of kinetic intermediates
of biomolecules.11−14 The IMS–MS coupling provides two dimensional separations:
(i) separation based on the size/charge and (ii) separation based
on their m/z. IMS-MS has addressed
several shortcomings of conventional methods by reducing the analysis
time (millisecond timescale), sample consumption (ng), and sample
purity requirements. In addition, the recent implementation of trapped
IMS (TIMS)15,16 has shown better potential as
compared to other IMS technologies for the separation and structural
elucidation of biomolecules by providing high mobility resolving power
(R up to 400) in short time scales (50–500
ms).17−24 Due to the higher trapping efficiency and mobility resolution advantages,
TIMS–MS has gained significant attention for the investigation
of proteins25−29 and DNA30,31 dynamics in their native and denatured states.
When complemented with molecular dynamic simulations, IMS–MS
allows for the identification of specific intramolecular interactions
that stabilize the kinetic intermediates.32,33 Moreover, a recent study using TIMS exhibited great promise for
the structural investigation of peptide binding DNA under native conditions.34

The higher trapping efficiency and extended
mass range provided
by the new, convex TIMS geometry enabled, for the first time, the
inspections of the conformational space of two intrinsically disordered
DNA topoisomerases and their DNA-bound states. In particular, we describe
the conformational space of Escherichia coli topoisomerase IA (EcTopIA, Figure S1a) and variola virus topoisomerase IB (vTopIB, Figure S1b) and in complex with a single-stranded
DNA and with a stem-loop DNA. In the following discussion, special
emphasis is placed on the capability to resolve microstates by the
high-mobility-resolution TIMS, expected from the flexible nature of
topoisomerases IA and IB as well as the effect of the DNA binding
on the overall topology of both topoisomerases.

2 Results
and Discussion
Topoisomerases can assume a variety of conformations
to regulate
DNA supercoiling. The proposed action for type IA and IB topoisomerases
exhibits very different modes of operation. For example, topoisomerase
IA uses a strand-passage mechanism, in which a single supercoil is
removed per catalytic cycle, resulting in multiple topoisomer intermediates
that lead to a much more controlled topological change.35 For topoisomerase IB, a free-rotation mechanism
is used, where multiple supercoils are removed per catalytic cycle,
resulting in a much lower number of topoisomer intermediates as compared
to the strand-passage mechanism.36 However,
structural information regarding the dynamics of topoisomerases when
processing DNA supercoils is limited because of the inherent flexibility
of the domains. A discussion on the microheterogeneity of EcTopIA
and vTopIB is provided, and their measured collision cross sections
(CCSs) are listed in Tables S1 and S2.

2.1 Native nESI–TIMS–MS Analysis
of EcTopIA and DNA-Bound Form
The analysis of the EcTopIA
enzyme (97.5 kDa) under native conditions resulted in a narrow charge
state distribution (16+ to 21+, Figure 1a) at m/z of 4600–6200 with
multiple IMS bands per charge state (Figure 1b), corresponding to the intact EcTopIA native-like
states. A pattern of conformational change was observed under native
conditions, covering a CCS range of ∼5150 to 6150 Å2 (Table S1). Slight opening of
the enzyme followed by conformational changes back to a more compact
structure was observed with the increase of the charge state (Figure 1b). Moreover, these
changes were significant enough to identify 12 transition states (Figure 1b). This peculiar
trend of opening and closing can give insight into the intermediates
involved in the strand-passage mechanism and inter/intramolecular
interactions that stabilize EcTopIA. In addition, the flexible nature
of EcTopIA is evidenced by the large diversity of conformers. The
results provided by native TIMS–MS data are consistent with
previous structural studies performed on EcTopIA,37 supporting the presence of multiple structural microstates
for type IA topoisomerases when not bound to DNA. Crystallographically
independent structures of the 30 kDa fragment of EcTopIA demonstrated
that the two domains (D2, D3) present in this 30 kDa fragment remain
largely unchanged, and their relative arrangement can change dramatically.38 Spectroscopic characterization of EcTopIA in
solution also showed extensive interdomain interactions involving
both the N-terminal (D1–D4) and C-terminal (D5–D9) domains.39 This indicates that the overall arrangement
of the enzyme domains can change in a dramatic way. For example, the
hinge between domains D2 and D4 may regulate the opening and closing
of the N-terminal domains.10

species of E. coli topoisomerase IA.

representation of the three-dimensional structure is shown in the
inset for illustrative purposes.

Structural analysis by means of traditional techniques often
proves
to be difficult because of the inherent flexibility of EcTopIA. However,
a recent study reported a crystal structure of EcTopIA in complex
with a single-stranded DNA, providing important insights into the
mechanism of genome regulation by type IA topoisomerases responsible
for removing negative DNA supercoils.10 Flexible linkers connect between some of the C-terminal domains.
The large number of EcTopIA structural microstates may have been a
factor as to why the crystal structure of full length EcTopIA could
not be obtained until movements of the C-terminal domains were restricted
by the binding of the single-stranded DNA substrate.

The analysis
of the E. coli topoisomerase
I when in complex with a single-stranded DNA (105 kDa) under native
conditions exhibited a 1:2 binding stoichiometry, resulting in four
charge states (17+ to 20+, Figure 2a). It should be mentioned that the 1:1 stoichiometry
complex was not observed. Inspection of the IMS profiles displayed
similar CCS values when increasing the charge state (Figure 2b). DNA binding as observed
in the crystal structure of full length E. coli topoisomerase I bound to single-stranded DNA (PDB 4RUL) would select
for a narrow range of conformers with relative orientations of the
C-terminal domains (D5–D9) restricted by the interaction with
the single-stranded DNA substrate. The comparison of the CCS range
between EcTopIA and in complex with two single-stranded DNAs showed
a smaller CCS range for the DNA-bound form binding (150 Å2) when compared with the EcTopIA (800 Å2)
over the same native charge states, resulting in the identification
of three microstates. In addition, slightly narrower mobility bands
as compared to EcTopIA were observed, suggesting that the two single-stranded
DNAs reduce the flexibility of the enzyme (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Typical (a) MS and (b) TIMS spectra for the
multiply protonated
species of E. coli topoisomerase IA in complex with
two single-stranded DNAs. The dashed lines highlight the different
microstates observed. A schematic of the DNA complex is represented
in the inset for illustrative purposes.

The structural investigation of EcTopIA in complex with a
stem-loop
DNA (115 kDa) was also performed. The analysis of this DNA-bound complex
under native conditions showed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry resulting
in six charge states (17+ to 22+, Figure 3a). Inspection of the corresponding conformers
exhibited narrower mobility bands as compared to EcTopIA and the DNA-bound
form using the two single-stranded DNAs (Figure 3b). This suggests that the stem-loop DNA
highly reduces the flexibility of the enzyme. In addition, a significant
increase in the CCS values was observed per charge state, suggesting
that multiple microstates can be obtained (Figure 3b). Comparison of the CCS range between EcTopIA
in complex with two single-stranded DNAs and in complex with a stem-loop
DNA showed a much larger CCS range in the case of the stem-loop DNA
(750 Å2) compared to the two single-stranded DNAs
(150 Å2) for the same charge states. Although a significant
reduction of the flexibility of EcTopIA when bound to the stem-loop
DNA was observed, several conformations were observed under native
conditions, covering a CCS range of ∼5150 to 6150 Å2 (Table S1). The presence of more
extended structures with the charge state is reflected by the significantly
higher number of microstates for the stem-loop DNA binding (9) when
compared to the DNA-bound form with two single-stranded DNAs (3).
In addition, conformational changes were observed, where more compact
structures for the 19+ charge state as well as an increase of the
mobility bands for the 20+ and 21+ protonated species are obtained.
This trend is different from the EcTopIA in the DNA-bound form with
single-stranded DNA, suggesting that a larger number of intermediates
are involved in the strand-passage mechanism and inter/intramolecular
interactions that stabilize EcTopIA but could also be explained by
a charge arrangement that more readily causes a structural transformation
in the gas phase.

species of E. coli topoisomerase IA in complex with
a stem loop DNA. The dashed lines highlight the different microstates
observed. A schematic of the DNA complex is represented in the inset
for illustrative purposes.

The stem-loop DNA is expected to interact with both the N-terminal
and C-terminal domains of EcTopIA. The protein–DNA interactions
can be observed readily in the available crystal structures (PDB 1MW8
for N-terminal domain interactions and PDB 4RUL for C-terminal domain
interactions) and studied in biochemical experiments.40 These include cation–phosphate and cation−π
interactions. Thus, binding of the stem-loop DNA would stabilize the
charge states.

In addition, DNA cleavage may occur during incubation
of topoisomerase
with the substrate, especially for EcTopIA because the single-stranded
DNA and stem-loop DNA used in this study contains a preferred cleavage
site for this enzyme. Unlike negatively supercoiled duplex DNA, the
single-stranded DNA and stem-loop DNA substrates do not become relaxed
by the enzyme over the time course of incubation. DNA-bound EcTopIA
complexes correspond to a mixture of ligated, cleaved/closed, and
cleaved/open complexes, as described in the recent single-molecule
study of topoisomerase IA gate dynamics.41 Although there is heterogeneity from the ligated versus cleaved
state of DNA, single-stranded DNA and stem-loop DNA binding reduce
structural heterogeneity by limiting the large number of possible
relative domain movements.

2.2 Native nESI–TIMS–MS
Analysis
of vTopIB and the DNA Bound Form
The analysis of the vTopIB
enzyme (38.5 kDa) under native conditions resulted in a narrow charge
state distribution (10+ to 14+) at m/z 2700–3900
(Figure 4a). Inspection
of the TIMS profiles showed the presence of several conformations,
covering a CCS range of ∼2900 to 3950 Å2 (Table S2). An opening of the enzyme is observed
for the 13+ protonated species, evidencing nine microstates (Figure 4b). The TIMS spectra
displayed the native-like states for the 10+ to 13+ protonated species
of vTopIB. A transition phase was observed starting at the +13 protonated
species toward more open conformational states. The number of conformers
provides insights into the number of transitional intermediates of
vTopIB. Inspection of the crystal structures of vTopIB in the DNA-bound
form shows that a flexible linker connects the N-and C-terminal domains,42,43 allowing both ends of the enzyme to surround the DNA substrate and
form contacts on opposite sides of the duplex.44 This supports our findings on the number of transitional
intermediates during the vTopIB free-rotation mechanism. In particular,
our results suggest that movements of these domains away from each
other can stem from Coulombic repulsion of exposed basic residues
to protonation from these domains, which in the absence of DNA are
exposed and not stabilized.

Figure 4 Typical (a) MS and (b) TIMS spectra for the
multiply protonated
species of variola virus topoisomerase IB. The dashed
lines highlight the different microstates observed. The three-dimensional
structure of vTopIB (PDB 2H7G)48 is shown
in the inset for illustrative purposes.

The interaction of TopIB with duplex DNA occurs via single-strand
break to form a covalent intermediate bond between the catalytic tyrosine
and the 3′-phosphoryl end of the broken strand.44 The analysis of the variola virus topoisomerase IB in the DNA-bound form to a stem-loop DNA
(57 kDa) harboring the preferred binding sequence 5′-CCCTG-3′45−47 under native conditions exhibited a 1:1 binding stoichiometry across
three charge states (12+ to 14+, Figure 5a). Inspection of the IMS profiles displayed
small changes in the CCS values when increasing the charge state,
suggesting that the stem-loop DNA binding selects for a narrow range
of conformers restricted by the interaction with the DNA substrate
(Figure 5b). Comparison
of the CCS range between vTopIB and the DNA-bound form with a stem-loop
DNA shows a much narrower CCS range for the DNA binding (∼150
Å2 versus ∼1000 Å2) across
the same charge states. Inspection of the IMS profiles for the vTopIB
DNA-bound form with a stem loop DNA shows narrower mobility bands
at similar CCS as compared to the unbound vTopIB for the same charge
states, resulting in the identification of only one microstate, which
is slightly more elongated when increasing the charge state probably
because of the Coulombic repulsion (Figure 5b). This trend suggests that the stem-loop
DNA efficiently reduces the flexibility of the enzyme. In addition,
comparison of the +12, +13, and +14 protonated species of both the
unbound and DNA-bound enzyme revealed that the DNA complex achieves
more compact conformations as compared to the denatured states of
the unbound vTopIB (Table S2). Hence, the
DNA stem loop induces the transition to a more compact structure.
The formation of vTopIB into a folded C-shaped clamp, enveloping both
the major and minor grooves of DNA, is strongly supported by this
IMS results.

species of variola virus topoisomerase IB in complex with a stem-loop
DNA. The dashed lines highlight the different microstates observed.

2.3 Comparison
between EcTopIA and vTopIB Observations
The comparison of
the charge state distributions and mobility profiles
of the unbound EcTopIA and vTopIB shows some major differences, relating
specifically to the disparity of each enzyme size (97.5 kDa vs 38.5
kDa, respectively). For example, closer investigation reveals that
the unfolding of the native-like states of vTopIB is more easily induced
in comparison to EcTopIA. Our results suggest that the greater conformational
flexibility of the unbound vTopIB is most likely attributed to the
motion of the interdomain hinge region49 or the protease-sensitive bridge,50 and
that a strong intramolecular interaction network is present in EcTopIA
that stabilizes the enzyme in a compact form. Comparison of the DNA-bound
states shows similar trends despite inherent differences on the charge
state distributions, CCS profiles, and number of conformational space.
For example, for both enzymes, the binding to DNA significantly reduces
their flexibility.

3 Conclusions
A detailed
investigation of the microheterogeneity of EcTopIA and
vTopIB in their unbound DNA-bound states is presented using a second-generation
TIMS–MS. In particular, the analytical power of native TIMS–MS
for the study of intrinsically disordered and dynamic enzymes and
their complexes is shown. The EcTopIA and vTopIB enzymes exhibited
differences in their intermediates. The unfolding of vTopIB is more
easily induced, whereas the compact structures of EcTopIA evidence
the presence of a strong intramolecular interaction network. The present
results revealed that the DNA binding plays a significant role in
reducing the flexibility of the topoisomerases. A number of microstates
are reported for the unbound EcTopIA and vTopIB enzymes, as well as
for the DNA-bound forms to single-stranded DNA and to a stem-loop
DNA. CCS values are reported for all the microstates, which will further
enable the generation of candidate three dimensional structures.

This work highlights the unique advantages of native TIMS–MS
compared to traditional techniques with respect to the small amount
of material needed for the analysis and the analysis time (millisecond
timescale). For the case of the structural characterization of enzyme–DNA
complexes, the TIMS–MS technology provides unique experimental
findings to better understand the mechanisms involved in DNA substrate
recognition, binding, and assembly of the catalytically active enzyme–DNA
complex.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Reagents
The E. coli topoisomerase
IA (97.5 kDa, sequence: UniProt
P06612) was expressed and purified as described elsewhere.10,51 The variola virus topoisomerase IB (38.5 kDa, sequence:
UniProt P68697) was expressed and purified as described previously.52 Single-stranded DNA (5′-AATGCGCTTTGGG-3′)
with the preferred cleavage site of EcTopIA used previously in structural
studies53 and stem loop DNA (5′-GCCCTGAAAGATTATGGAATGCGATTAGGGT-AAAGGAAGAGAGCATAATCTTTCAGGGC-3′)
for characterizing EcTopIA activity,54−57 consisting of a 16-base-pair
stem and a 27-base loop, were provided by Biosearch Technologies (Petaluma,
CA) and dialyzed in 100 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) before analysis. Topoisomerases were prepared at a final concentration
of 10 μM in 100 mM aqueous NH4Ac under native conditions
(pH = 6.7). For DNA complexes, a 1:1 ratio of 5 μM DNA and enzyme
was prepared in 100 mM aqueous NH4Ac immediately prior
nESI infusion. Low-concentration Tuning Mix calibration standard (TuneMix,
G24221A) was purchased from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA)
and used to calibrate the instrument.

4.2 Native
TIMS–MS Experiments
Ion mobility experiments were
performed on a custom-built nanoESI–TIMS
coupled to an Impact Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, Figure S4).15 Different
from previous studies, a second-generation convex TIMS geometry was
utilized to increase the trapping efficiency, resolving power, and
the m/z range.58 The TIMS unit is run by custom software in LabView (National
Instruments) synchronized with the MS platform controls.31 Sample aliquots (10 μL) were loaded in
a pulled-tip capillary (O.D.: 1.0 mm and I.D.: 0.70 mm) and sprayed
at 600–1500 V. Briefly, the ion mobility separation in a TIMS
device is based on holding the ions stationary using an electric field
(E) against a moving buffer gas (Figure S4).59 TIMS separation depends
on the gas flow velocity (vg), elution
voltage (Velution), ramp time (tramp), and base voltage (Vout).15,59 The reduced mobility, K0, is defined by 1  

The constant A is determined using calibration standards
(Tuning Mix)
of known reduced mobilities.60 In TIMS
operation, multiple conformers are trapped simultaneously at different E values resulting from a voltage gradient applied across
the IMS tunnel region (Figure S4). After
thermalization, conformers are eluted by decreasing the electric field
in stepwise decrements (Figure S4). Each
conformer eluting from the TIMS cell can be described by a characteristic
voltage (Velution). In a TIMS device,
the total analysis time (tT) can be described
as 2  where ttrap is the thermalization/trapping
time, tof is the time after
the ion mobility separation, and Vramp and tramp are the voltage range and
time required to vary the electric field, respectively. The elution
voltage is experimentally determined by varying the ramp time for
a constant ramp voltage. A linear dependence of tT on tramp for all the investigated m/z was obtained as describe elsewhere.60 From the slope and the intercept of this graph, the mobility
values can be determined using the calibration constant A determined
using known mobilities. Mobilities are converted into collision cross
sections (CCS, Å2) using the Mason–Schamp equation 3  where q is
the ion charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, N is the gas number density, m is the ion
mass, and M is the gas molecule mass.593 TIMS separation was carried out using nitrogen (N2) at
ambient temperature (T) with vg set by the pressure difference between the funnel entrance
(P1 = 2.6 mbar) and exit (P2 = 1.1
mbar, Figure S4). An rf voltage of 275
Vpp at 880 kHz was applied to all electrodes.

4.3 Data Processing
TIMS profiles were
processed using a custom-built software-assisted molecular elucidation
(SAME) package – a specifically designed two-dimensional (2D)
TIMS–MS data processing script written in Python version 2.7.23,61 The SAME package utilizes noise removal, mean gap filling, “asymmetric
least-squares smoothing” baseline correction, peak detection
by a continuous wavelet transform-based peak detection algorithm (SciPy
package), and Gaussian fitting with nonlinear least-squares functions
(Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm). This procedure has been previously
utilized for unsupervised mobility assignments from a complex mixture23,61 and is now presented for the case of proteins. To determine the
number of IMS bands and to fit the IMS profiles, the narrowest observed
peak for each molecular system was considered in the fitting criterion,
leaving the centroid, area, and number of peaks as fitting parameters.
The same fitting criterion can be applied to all charge states because
the diffusion of the ions is negligible in a TIMS device, in contrast
to other IMS technologies. The FWHM information per CCS is listed
in Tables S1 and S2 for EcTopIA and vTopIB, respectively.
