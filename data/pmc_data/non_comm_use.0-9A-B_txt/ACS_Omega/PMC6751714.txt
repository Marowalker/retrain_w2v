Prostate cancer is
the most prevalent and the second most lethal malignancy among males
in the United States of America. Its diagnosis is almost entirely
predicated upon histopathological analysis of the biopsied tissue,
and it is associated with a substantial average error. Using genome-wide
DNA methylation data derived from 469 prostatic tumor tissue samples
and 50 normal prostatic tissue samples and interrogating over 485 000
CpG sites per sample (spanning across gene promoters, CpG islands,
shores, shelves, gene bodies, and intergenic and other areas), we
were able to develop a mathematical model that classified with a
high accuracy (overall sensitivity = 95.31% and overall specificity
= 94.00%) tumor tissue versus normal tissue. The methylation β
values of five CpG sites, corresponding to the genes LINC01091, RPS15,  SNORA10, and two unknown DNA areas in chromosome 1, provided the input to
the model. The model was validated with unknown samples, as well as
with a sixfold cross-validation and a leave-one-out cross-validation.
This study presents a novel genomic model based on genome-wide DNA
methylation analysis of biopsied prostatic tissue that could aid
in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and help advance the transition
to genomic medicine.

1 Introduction
1.1 Prostate Cancer and Its Diagnosis
Among males in the
United States of America, prostate cancer is the most prevalent (approximately
165 000 new cases every year) and the second most lethal malignancy
(approximately 29 000 deaths every year).1 The pathological diagnosis of prostate cancer via a biopsy
is associated with an average error of 25–30% in the case of
underdetection and an average error of 1.3–7.1% in the case
of overdetection,2,3 and in some cases, the underdetection
error is considerably higher.4 Furthermore,
the accuracy of a Gleason score—based on a scale used by pathologists
to grade biopsied prostate tumors—is estimated to be 61%.5 All those different types of error associated
with the current method of prostate cancer diagnosis, in all likelihood,
stem from the observation that histopathological analysis of tissue
(performed at the tissue level) does not have the requisite resolution
to discern those molecular processes and mechanisms, such as epigenetic
modifications, that initiate tumorigenesis and drive its early evolution
(occurring at the molecular level).

1.2 Epigenetic
Modifications
Epigenetic modifications are molecular mechanisms
that provide cells with the means to regulate gene expression without
altering the DNA, and they include DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling,
microRNAs (miRNAs), long intergenic nonprotein coding RNAs (lincRNAs),
small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), etc. Chromatin remodeling pertains
to covalent modifications of histones, proteins that act as spools
around which DNA is wound and compacted. Chromatin-remodeling mechanisms
include histone methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
etc., and some of them, such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, have gene-activating
functions, whereas others have gene-inactivating functions, such as
H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.6,7 miRNAs regulate messenger RNA
(mRNA) and can suppress gene expression either by degrading mRNA or
by inhibiting translation.8

In addition
to regulating mRNA, lincRNAs can activate or inactivate transcription-regulating
genes and homeobox genes, and they are involved in transcription,
translation, splicing, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation,
etc.9−11 Dysregulation and aberrant expression of lincRNAs
have been observed in the pathogenesis of numerous types of cancer;10,12,13 lincRNAs have been associated
with various cancer subtypes;12 and overexpression
of lincRNAs has been observed to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition and metastasis, both of which are characteristic of the
most aggressive tumors.13 In this study,
the lincRNA LINC01091, which was found to be significantly
unmethylated in the tumor cells as compared with normal cells, is
one of the input variables to the model.

snoRNAs modify mainly
ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is essential for protein synthesis, as
well as transfer RNA (tRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and mRNA,
and they are involved in ribosome biogenesis, splicing, and telomere
maintenance.14−16 Just as in the case of lincRNAs, dysregulation of
snoRNAs has been linked to various types of cancer,17,18 and the overexpression of some of them has been observed to promote
tumorigenesis and to be indirectly proportional to patient survival
time.18 In this study, one of the five
input variables to the model is the snoRNA SNORA10, which was found to be significantly unmethylated in the tumor cells,
and another input variable is the ribosomal protein RPS15, which was also found to be significantly unmethylated in the tumor
cells.

1.3 DNA Methylation
One of the most common
and important epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation, which is
used by cells for gene-inactivation purposes. It involves the addition
of a methyl group (−CH3) at specific locations of
the DNA molecule, called CpG sites, where a cytosine nucleotide is
bound to, and immediately followed by, a guanine nucleotide. CpG sites
are highly concentrated in certain DNA areas, called CpG islands,
where the vast majority of gene promoters lie; methylation of CpG
islands results in stable gene inactivation.19 Within a distance of about 2 000 base pairs away from the
CpG islands, and extending in both directions, there are DNA areas
with a lower concentration of CpG sites, called CpG island shores.20 Extending farther, within a distance of about
2 000 base pairs away from the CpG island shores and in both
directions, there are DNA areas with even lower concentration of CpG
sites, called CpG island shelves.21 Finally,
in the DNA area which corresponds to the gene body, and which extends
beyond the first exon, there are also CpG sites.19 In normal cells, DNA methylation plays a most important
role in embryonic stem cell differentiation, embryonic development,
genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, transposable element
inactivation, etc. In the case of tumor cells, on the other hand,
the process of DNA methylation, like other epigenetic modifications
and many other cellular processes, is hijacked, and it is used to
activate (demethylate) genes that are vital or beneficial to them
and to inactivate (methylate) genes that are detrimental to them.
Aberrant alterations of DNA methylation, which include, among others,
demethylation of genes that promote tumorigenesis and methylation
of genes that suppress tumorigenesis, have been observed from CpG
islands and the gene promoters to CpG island shelves and the CpG sites
in gene bodies in many types of cancer.20,22,23 It is interesting to point out here that the average
levels of genome-wide DNA methylation begin to decline years before
cancer diagnosis.23

1.4 Hypothesis
The hypothesis of this study is that tumor cells have effected
significant changes in the methylomic profile of a number of genes
and that, consequently, these methylomic changes can discriminate
between tumor cells and normal cells.

1.5 Model
Overview
In this study, we were able to develop a multivariable
function, whose five input variables were the methylation β
values of five CpG sites, corresponding to the genes LINC01091, RPS15, SNORA10, and two unknown
DNA areas in chromosome 1 (genomic coordinates 201509316 and 220697615).
The model (multivariable function) was developed during the training
phase using approximately 70% of all available samples, that is, 329
tumor samples and 35 normal samples, and it was based on the methylomic
analysis of over 485 000 CpG sites per sample (spanning across
gene promoters, CpG islands, shores, shelves, gene bodies, and intergenic
and other areas). Following its development, the model was validated
with unknown samples (approximately 30% of all available samples,
i.e., 140 tumor samples and 15 normal samples), which had been randomly
preallocated at the beginning of the study and used only for testing
purposes. Subsequently, the model was further tested with a sixfold
cross-validation and a leave-one-out cross-validation. The overall
performance of the model, including the training and the validation
phases, was sensitivity = (447/469) = 95.31% and specificity = (47/50)
= 94.00%.

2 Methods
2.1 Data
All data used in this study were the normalized data obtained from
469 prostatic tumor tissue samples and 50 normal prostatic tissue
samples, generated from DNA methylation analysis of the tissue using
the Infinium Human Methylation 450 Bead Chip by Illumina, and downloaded
from The Cancer Genome Atlas of the National Cancer Institute under
the category PRAD.

2.2 Clinical Methods
All tumor samples used in this study were primary tumors obtained
from a biopsy used for the initial diagnosis and prior to the administration
of any treatment. Furthermore, in this study, tumor samples were included
only if they had been obtained from subjects that did not have a history
of prior and/or other malignancy. The range of the Gleason scores
of all 469 tumor samples was from 6 to 10 (Table S1). The Gleason grading system, with a possible score between
2 and 10, is currently used for the grading of prostate cancer and
for the clinical prognosis. Patients with tumors with a Gleason score
≤ 6 are considered to have good prognoses (typically, no treatment
is recommended),24 whereas patients with
tumors with the highest scores are considered to have the worst prognoses.

2.3 Statistical Methods
Using only the data
from the training set, a methylomic analysis was performed. Given
that the total number of variables (CpG sites) per sample was 485 577
and using the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, the statistical
significance level for the methylomic analysis was set at α
= (0.05/485 577) = 1.03 × 10–7 (two-tailed).
Therefore, in order for any variable to be deemed statistically significant,
it must  have a P value < 1.03 ×
10–7. The calculation of the P value
of a given variable was done in accordance with the individual conditions
imposed by various statistical tests. More specifically, for those
variables that were normally distributed with respect to both groups
and met the equality of variance condition, the independent t-test was used to calculate their P value.
For those variables that were normally distributed with respect to
both groups and failed to meet the equality of variance condition,
the Welch unequal-variance t-test was used to calculate
their P value. Finally, for those variables that
were not normally distributed with respect to both groups, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to calculate their P value.
Moreover, in the case of the Mann–Whitney U test, although there were no ties in any of the variables, the approximate
method with correction was used because of large group sample sizes.
The Anderson–Darling test was used to assess normality, and
the Levene absolute test for equal variances was used to assess the
equality of variance throughout this study.

The sixfold cross-validation
and the leave-one-out cross-validation were performed using the same
methods as in one of our previous studies.25 Briefly, in the case of the former, six rounds (six folds) of training
and testing were performed. In each round, approximately 5/6 of the
total number of samples were randomly selected and used for training
purposes, whereas the remaining approximately 1/6 of samples were
used for testing. At the end, the misclassification rate and the mean-squared
error were calculated based on the total number of misclassifications.
In the case of the leave-one-out cross-validation, the number of rounds
was equal to the total number of samples (519). In each round, one
sample was randomly left out and used for testing, and it was excluded
from being selected again in any of the remaining rounds. At the end,
the misclassification rate and the mean-squared error were calculated
based on the total number of misclassifications.

In addition
to the aforementioned criterion of statistical significance (P < 1.03 × 10–7), a criterion
of biological significance was imposed. In order for a CpG site to
be deemed significantly differentially methylated by the two groups,
namely, T (tumor samples) and N (normal samples), the mean β
value of one group must be β ≥ 0.60 and, at the same
time, the mean β value of the other group must be β ≤
0.40. This would ensure with a great confidence that a particular
CpG site was methylated (β ≥ 0.60) by one group and concurrently
unmethylated (β ≤ 0.40) by the other group. In summary,
both the statistical significance criterion and the biological significance
criterion had to be met in order for a particular CpG variable to
be deemed significant. The rationale for this follows next.

2.4 β Value
The methylation β value for a CpG
site is defined by Illumina21 as follows 1  

In eq 1, M is the methylated signal detected by probes with respect to both
alleles at a particular CpG site; U is the unmethylated
signal detected by probes with respect to both alleles at a particular
CpG site; and Cn is a
normalization constant (Cn > 0). The scale of the β value is continuous, and its range
is the interval [0, 1). For all practical purposes, β may be
considered as the methylation percentage of a particular CpG site
with respect to both alleles expressed in the decimal form. A β
value equal to zero indicates that a CpG site is unmethylated (0%
methylated) with respect to both alleles (in this case, M = 0 and U = 1), whereas a β value very close
to one indicates that a CpG site is 100% methylated with respect to
both alleles (in this case, M = 1 and U = 0).

In this study, we were solely interested in those CpG
sites that were methylated by one group (either T or N) and, at the
same time, were unmethylated by the other group. To state it differently
and more broadly, the goal of this study was (a) to identify all the
CpG sites in the human genome in which prostatic tumor cells effected
significant methylomic alterations and (b) to use those CpG sites
to develop a genomic model that could identify with a high accuracy
tumor tissue versus normal tissue. To that end, we imposed the aforementioned
stringent biological criterion of significance. More specifically,
we did not follow the widely used β = 0.50 point as the criterion
of methylation, such that if β > 0.50, a particular CpG site
is considered methylated, and if β < 0.50, that CpG site
is considered unmethylated. In our view, that criterion is very precarious
and could easily be unreliable and misleading. The technology is not
perfect, and the wrong signal by only a few probes could lead to β
= 0.51 instead of β = 0.49. In this case, the particular CpG
site is erroneously assumed to be methylated. To avoid this type of
error and to increase the confidence, we imposed the following and
very conservative criterion of methylation: in order for a CpG site
to be deemed methylated, it should have β ≥ 0.60, and
conversely, in order for a CpG site to be deemed unmethylated, it
should have β ≤ 0.40. This further means that in order
to arrive at either a false-positive or a false-negative methylation
conclusion, more than 20% of the probe signals would have to be erroneous,
something which is not likely. Since, as was mentioned above, in this
study, we were exclusively interested in those CpG sites that were
methylated by one group (either T or N) and, at the same time, were
unmethylated by the other group, we imposed the aforementioned stringent
biological criterion of significance, whereby in order for a CpG site
to be deemed biologically significant, that CpG site had to be methylated
by one group (with a β ≥ 0.60) and, at the same time,
had to be unmethylated by the other group (with a β ≤
0.40).

2.5 Development of the Model
Approximately,
70% of the total number of samples from each group were randomly selected
for the training set, and the remaining approximately 30% of the samples
were assigned to the validation set. Subsequently, the random selection
of the tumor samples was modified in order for the following condition
to be fulfilled. The training set had to comprise approximately 70%
of the tumor samples with a particular Gleason score. To that end,
approximately 70% of the tumor samples with a particular Gleason score
were randomly selected and assigned to the training set, and the remaining
approximately 30% were assigned to the validation set. Therefore,
the training set comprised 329/469 tumor and 35/50 normal samples.
In the 329 tumor samples, there were 30 with a Gleason score GS =
6; 163 with GS = 7; 42 with GS = 8; 91 with GS = 9; and 3 with GS
= 10 (Table S2). The validation set comprised
140/469 tumor and 15/50 normal samples. In the 140 tumor samples,
there were 13 with GS = 6; 69 with GS = 7; 18 with GS = 8; 39 with
GS = 9; and 1 with GS = 10 (Table S3).

Of the 485 577 variables interrogated during the methylomic
analysis using the data from the training set, 2 913 met both
of the aforementioned criteria of significance and provided the variable
pool for the development of the model. Using the same methodology
as in our previous studies,25−28 we were able to develop the following multivariable
function (eq 2). Briefly,
multiple functions, with at most ten input variables for each one
of them, were generated and tested with computer simulations using
the training set. Equation 2 exhibited the best performance (highest sensitivity and highest
specificity) in the training phase and was selected for validation. 2  

In eq 2, X1 corresponds to the gene RPS15, and X1 = β1 × 100  (i.e., the β value of X1 expressed in the percentage form); X2 corresponds to the snoRNA SNORA10, and X2 = β2 ×
100;  X3 corresponds to the lincRNA LINC01091, and X3 = β3 × 100;  X4 corresponds
to the unknown DNA area in chromosome 1 with the genomic coordinate
of 220697615, and X4 = β4 × 100;  and X5 corresponds to the unknown DNA area in chromosome 1 with the genomic
coordinate of 201509316, and X5 =
β5 × 100.  C is a constant and is equal to 103.

Since X1–X5 are
the respective β values of the aforementioned genes expressed
in the percentage form and since the value of each one of them belongs
in the continuous interval [0, 100) (eq 1), the domain of F (eq 2) is the interval [0, 100). Moreover,
since X5 ≥ 0, the function F is continuous and defined throughout its domain [0, 100).
From eq 2, one can see
that F attains its minimum value when X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 0 and X5 ≈ 100, and in that case, Fmin ≈ 3.22. Similarly, when X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 ≈ 100 and X5 = 0, F attains its maximum value, and
in that case, Fmax ≈ 29.01. Therefore,
the range of the function F is the interval (3.22,
29.01). Based on all 519 samples used in this study, the observed
range of F was [10.146, 17.127] (Table S1).

The cutoff point (COP) that
demarcates a score of a tumor sample from that of a normal sample
was determined to be COP = 15.258 using a receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis on the results of the F function
in the training phase, as well as taking into account the respective
variances of the two groups (T vs N). An F score
< COP signifies a tumor sample, whereas an F score
≥ COP signifies a normal sample. The COP can be adjusted in
the future within the constraints of ROC curve analysis in order to
optimize the performance of the model in a subsequent clinical trial
study. The methylomic analysis revealed that in the case of tumor
cells, X1–X4 were significantly unmethylated (low β values) and X5 was significantly methylated (high β
value) as compared with normal cells (Table 1). Taking those results into consideration,
as well as the COP, one can see that the Fmin represents, at least theoretically, the worst possible methylomic
state in which tumor cells could be. This makes biological sense because
in that case, X1–X4 are completely unmethylated, while X5 is completely methylated, and   this methylomic
state is the farthest from the normal one. In the opposite direction,
the Fmax represents theoretically
the most extreme methylomic state in which normal cells could be: X1–X4 are
completely methylated, while X5 is completely
unmethylated. There are two more interesting possibilities that need
to be considered here. In the case where X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = X5 = 0, eq 2 yields F = 6.91. According to the COP, this score, which is very
low, corresponds to a tumor sample, and this makes biological sense
because four out of five markers (X1–X4) exhibit the worst possible methylomic profile
that tumor cells could have—they are all completely unmethylated.
Finally, in the case where X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = X5 ≈
100, eq 2 yields F ≈ 25.33. This score, which is very high, corresponds
to a normal sample, and from a biology perspective, it makes sense
because four out of five markers (X1–X4) exhibit the most extreme methylomic profile
that normal cells could have—they are all completely methylated.

as follows: R = MT/MN. If R ≥ 1, FC = R; if R < 1, FC = −1/R.

2.6 Principal Component Analysis
Following the same methodology
as the one in one of our previous studies29 and using the five variables (X1–X5), we performed a principal component analysis
(PCA). The scores of the five principal components (PC1–PC5)
are listed in Table S4.

3 Results
3.1 Methylomic Analysis
The methylomic
results in connection with the five input variables of the model based
on the data of the training set appear in Table 1, wherein the variable name, the gene symbol,
the NCBI gene ID, the genomic coordinate, the mean β value (MT) of the T (tumor) group with its standard
deviation (SDT), the mean β value (MN) of the N (normal) group with its standard deviation
(SDN), the fold change (FC), and the probability of significance
(P) for all five variables are listed.

3.2 Training
In the training phase, the model (eq 2) identified correctly
312/329 tumor samples and 33/35 normal samples (Table S2). The sensitivity, therefore, was 94.83%, and the
specificity was 94.29%. The ROC AUC statistics were as follows: AUC
= 0.97647, its standard error was AUC SE = 0.00964, z-value = 49.41, and the 95% confidence interval of the AUC value
was [0.94773, 0.98949] (Figure 1A). The T group had a mean F score and a
standard deviation of FT = 13.5061 ±
1.2254, and its median value was 13.5457. Using 100 000 Monte
Carlo simulations and 100 000 Bootstrap simulations, the 99%
confidence interval of the FT was calculated
to be [13.3315, 13.6799]. The N group had a mean F score and a standard deviation of FN = 16.2719 ± 0.5735, and its median value was 16.3988. Using
100 000 Monte Carlo simulations and 100 000 Bootstrap
simulations, the 99% confidence interval of the FN was calculated to be [16.0590, 16.5467]. The Mann–Whitney U test statistics were as follows: UT = 271, UN = 11 244, z-value = 9.2698, and the approximate probability of significance
with correction was P = 1.87 × 10–20 (Figure 1B).

3.3 Validation with Unknown Samples
Using the
155 preallocated unknown samples (140 tumor and 15 normal samples),
the model (eq 2) identified
correctly 135/140 tumor samples and 14/15 normal samples (Table S3). The sensitivity, therefore, was 96.43%,
and the specificity was 93.33%. The unknown T samples had a mean F score and a standard deviation of FT = 13.5759 ± 1.1354, and their median value was 13.7448.
The unknown N samples had a mean F score and a standard
deviation of FN = 16.1719 ± 0.8585,
and their median value was 16.3709. The Mann–Whitney U test statistics for the two groups of unknown samples
in connection with their F scores were as follows: UT = 91, UN = 2009, z-value = 5.8011, and the approximate probability of significance
with correction was P = 6.59 × 10–9.

3.4 Overall Performance
Combining the
364 samples (329 tumor and 35 normal) from the training phase with
the 155 unknown samples (140 tumor and 15 normal) from the validation
phase, the model’s overall performance was as follows: sensitivity
= (447/469) = 95.31% and specificity = (47/50) = 94.00% (Figure 2 and Table S1). The ROC AUC statistics
were as follows: AUC = 0.97053, its standard error was AUC SE = 0.01281, z-value = 36.73, and the 95% confidence interval of the
AUC value was [0.93142, 0.98748] (Figure 3A). The T group had a mean F score and a standard deviation of FT = 13.5269 ± 1.1984, and its median value was 13.6241. Using
100 000 Monte Carlo simulations and 100 000 Bootstrap
simulations, the 99% confidence interval of the FT was calculated to be [13.3848, 13.6706]. The N group
had a mean F score and a standard deviation of FN = 16.2419 ± 0.6640, and its median value
was 16.3939. Using 100 00 Monte Carlo simulations and 100 000
Bootstrap simulations, the 99% confidence interval of the FN was calculated to be [16.0343, 16.5067]. The
Mann–Whitney U test statistics were as follows: UT = 691, UN = 22 759, z-value = 10.9454, and the approximate probability of significance
with correction was P = 6.99 × 10–28. The range of all 519 F scores was [10.146, 17.127]
(Figure 3B). Finally, Table 2 shows the DNA methylation
results of the five input variables of the model based on the combined
data of the training and the validation sets. The variable name, the
gene symbol, the NCBI gene ID, the genomic coordinate, the mean β
value (MT) of the T (tumor) group with
its standard deviation (SDT), the mean β value (MN) of the N (normal) group with its standard
deviation (SDN), the FC, and the probability of significance
(P) for all five variables are listed.

as follows: R = MT/MN. If R ≥ 1, FC = R; if R < 1, FC = −1/R.

3.5 Cross-Validations
The sixfold cross-validation yielded
a misclassification rate of 9.63% (50/519) and a mean-squared error
of 0.096. The sensitivity was 0.900, and the specificity was 0.940.
The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was 0.643. The training
and testing sets for each of the six rounds, along with the confusion
matrix and other statistical information, appear in Table S5. Similarly, the leave-one-out cross-validation yielded
a misclassification rate of 9.63% (50/519), a mean-squared error of
0.096, a sensitivity of 0.900, a specificity of 0.940, and an MCC
of 0.643. The results of all 519 rounds, along with the confusion
matrix and other statistical information, appear in Table S6.

4 Discussion
Recent,
rapid advances in biotechnology have ushered in a genomic era. For
the first time, researchers have acquired the capability to probe
and monitor cellular events at the molecular level with unprecedented
resolution and accuracy. Considering that the onset of any dysregulation
of any cellular function results immediately in molecular changes
and considering that dysregulation of any cellular function might
take years to manifest itself at the tissue level, the importance
of the newly acquired genomic capabilities becomes obvious, and so
does the need to transition to genomic medicine.

Utilizing one
of those recent advances in biotechnology, namely, genome-wide DNA
methylation, we developed and presented in this study a novel genomic
test, operating at the molecular level, that could be used in the
clinic to aid in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A further clinical
validation with a retrospective study would lead to the accomplishment
of that goal, and it would also provide more information about the
interesting subject of the few statistical outliers in this study.
For example, in the N group, there were three samples with the lowest F scores for that group (from 14.669 to 13.398) (Figure 3B and Table S1), ranging from 2.37 to 4.28 standard
deviations below the mean value of that group. Those three samples
were determined to be statistical outliers, and they constituted the
only three misclassifications of the model with respect to the N group.
If they were to be removed from this study as extreme outliers, then
the performance of the model would increase considerably (specificity
= 100%). An interesting question that posits itself here is the following:
were those three samples—deemed to  be normal cells by
the pathology analysis—in actuality tumor cells, or were they
simply misclassified by the model? To further investigate this, we
performed a PCA using the five variables (X1–X5). The graph in Figure 4 shows the scores of the first
principal component (PC1) versus the scores of PC2. Using a completely
different method from that of our model, PCA, likewise, classified
those three normal samples as extreme outliers; they are the three
green spheres well above all other green spheres and embedded (though
still visible) in the midst of the red spheres (tumor samples). This
provides further and independent evidence about the actual nature
of those three normal samples. Furthermore, similar questions could
be posited regarding the T group. There were eight tumor samples with F scores higher than the mean F score of
the N group (Table S1, Figures 2 and 3B).

300 DPI).

In addition to its clinical applications,
this study has research implications. Of the five input variables
to the model, two are unknown DNA areas. It would be of great interest
to elucidate the reason(s) that tumor cells repress (methylate) one
of them (X5), whereas they derepress (demethylate)
the other one (X4). Any gain in knowledge
pertaining to the possible role of those two DNA areas in any cellular
functions might lead to new understanding and strategies against cancer.
Regarding two other variables, namely, the snoRNA SNORA10 (X2) and the lincRNA LINC01091 (X3), there exists very little research,
even though the overexpression of other members of those two RNA families,
as was mentioned earlier, has been associated with tumorigenesis.
Discovering any advantages that the overexpression of those two RNAs
confers to tumor cells would also be of great interest. Finally, regarding
the gene RPS15 (X1),
there is more research available, albeit to a limited extent. Upregulation
of RPS15 has been observed to endow esophageal and
gastric tumor cells with resistance to powerful chemotherapy agents.30,31 Moreover, mutations in RPS15 at highly conserved
sites resulting in gain of function have been identified as one of
the drivers of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and have been associated
with aggressive phenotype and shorter survival.32,33 Finally, of the three known DNA areas used in this study (variables X1–X3), only
one corresponds to a protein-coding gene, namely, RPS15. According to the results of our transcriptomic analysis, which
will be presented in a future study, RPS15 was significantly
and highly overexpressed in the tumor cells compared with the normal
ones.
