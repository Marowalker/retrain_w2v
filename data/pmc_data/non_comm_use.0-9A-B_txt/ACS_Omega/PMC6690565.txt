Mg, Ca, and Ba catalysts
supported on structured mesoporous silica oxides types MCM-41 and
Al-SBA-15 were synthesized and investigated in sulfone cracking for
sulfur removal from oxidized diesel fuel. Functional materials and
catalysts were characterized by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption,
transmission electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy techniques. Catalytic tests were carried out
in fixed-bed and batch reactors with a model compound dibenzothiophene
sulfone and oxidized diesel fraction as a feed. MgO/MCM-41 and MgO/Al-MCM-41
possess high activity in sulfone cracking. The sulfur content in the
diesel fraction decreases from initial 450 up to 100 ppmw. Catalysts
can be regenerated for reuse in several cycles and may be potentially
scaled up for industrial applications

1 Introduction
Reducing the sulfur content in oil fractions is a permanent issue
in the oil refining industry to meet the standards for motor fuels.
Thus, the technical regulation of the Customs Union limits the sulfur
content of class 5 diesel fuel to the level of 10 ppmw. Nowadays,
the main industrial processes in oil refining, to reduce the sulfur
content, are hydrotreating and hydrocracking. These technologies are
referred to as “hydroprocesses”, i.e., processes where
the main reaction is hydrogenolysis of sulfur-, nitrogen-, and oxygen-containing
organic compounds in petroleum fractions. Hydrogenolysis results in
hydrocarbons with hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and water formation.1 Thus, mercaptans, sulfides, disulfides, and thiophenes
are converted to paraffins or aromatic compounds with H2S release. Among the sulfur compounds, aliphatic ones (sulfides,
disulfides, mercaptans, etc.) are the most facile to hydrogenate.
Upon increasing the molecular weight of the fractions (and boiling
temperatures, consequently), the rate of the hydrodesulfurization
(HDS) decreases.2 Substituted thiophenes,
benzothiophenes, and especially dibenzothiophenes (DBT) are sulfur
compounds that are most difficult to remove from various oil fractions.3,4 The conversion of alkyl-substituted DBTs to hydrocarbons during
middle distillates hydrotreating requires rather severe conditions
due to steric hindrances of the sulfur atom (hydrogen pressure of
50 atm and higher and a temperature of 330–380 °C). The
combination of factors above significantly increase the cost of processes.5−8

An alternative approach for sulfur removal is oxidative desulfurization9−11 where petroleum sulfur compounds
are oxidized by various agents such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid,
potassium persulfate, nitrogen oxides, hypochlorites, peroxy acids,
hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and molecular oxygen. The
reactivity of oxidation increases with the higher electron density
of the sulfur compounds. Thus, DBT is more readily oxidized than benzothiophene
and thiophene reverses the reactivity of the HDS.12,13 As
a result, sulfur-containing organic compounds (sulfides, disulfides,
mercaptans, thiophenes, and DBTs) are oxidized to the corresponding
sulfoxides and sulfones.14−16 These compounds can be withdrawn by extraction, adsorption,17−21 or even membrane filtration22 methods. The process of extractive desulfurization is based
on the better solubility of sulfur-containing components and aromatic
hydrocarbons compared to nonaromatic ones in suitable polar solvents.23 Adsorption methods of fuel refining are based
on the selective extraction of sulfur compounds by solid adsorbents.24 Using these methods, however, leads to the loss
of refined diesel fuel, the
more the higher sulfur content in the feedstock. Thus, where diesel
fuel contains 10 000 ppm of sulfur (1%), after extraction of
95% of sulfur organic compounds, the loss of fuel is 4–6 wt
%. To avoid the loss of products, it would be possible to replace
the process of extracting sulfur- and oxygen-containing organic compounds
(oxidation products) for their conversion into hydrocarbons. One of
such oxidation products of sulfuric compounds are sulfones (organosulfur
compounds having two oxygen atoms attached to sulfur). In this regard,
the development of catalytic processes for selective removal of sulfur
from the sulfone molecule is of current interest.

It should
be noted that there are a limited number of reports on this issue
in the literature. It is known that the desulfonylation reaction (the
destruction of sulfones) is carried out with the help of catalysts
based on oxides and hydroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals.24−27 The
most active desulfonylation agents, quite attractive in cost as well,
are oxides of alkaline earth metals, namely, MgO28,29 and
CaO.30 Their catalytic activity can be
increased by various carriers having a developed surface (to ensure
an optimal distribution of active sites of the catalyst). One class
of such supports is the mesoporous materials having a pore size from
2 to 50 nm.31 Such materials are characterized
by an ordered structure and a narrow pore size distribution.32−35 Owing
to these properties, branched sulfur compounds penetrate into the
pores and it becomes possible to use materials in the field of heterogeneous
catalysis,36−41 oxidative desulfurization,42−44 as well as in sorption processes.45,46 The silicate
structure of mesoporous materials has no catalytic activity; therefore,
for carrying out various processes, surface modification or introduction
of active components into the pore volume is required.

In the
present work, catalytic desulfonylation was studied using a composition
of basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and BaO) supported on mesoporous carriers
of Al-SBA-15, Al-MCM-41, and MCM-41 types.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization
The samples containing MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 carriers were prepared
by impregnation thereof with metal salt solutions.

MgO/Al-SBA-15
and CaO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by direct synthesis (the
mesoporous structure of aluminosilicates was doped with active components
during formation thereof). After preparation, the composition of catalysts
obtained was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Table 1).

The textural characteristics of catalysts were investigated
using low-temperature adsorption–desorption of nitrogen. The
adsorption isotherms of samples correspond to type IV with a hysteresis
loop, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials (Figure S1). All of the catalysts obtained have
high specific surface areas (500–630 m2/g) and pore
volumes in the range of 0.5–1.2 cm3/g.

The
ordered porous structure of samples is shown in transmission electron
microphotographs (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Microphotographs of CaO/MCM-41
(1) and MgO/MCM-41 (2) samples.

It can be seen that the synthesized catalysts possess
an ordered pore structure with a pore diameter of about 3 nm (MCM-41
supported). The formation of the ordered mesoporous structure is confirmed
by low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption data and low-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure 2).

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction pattern
of the MgO/MCM-41 catalyst.

The catalyst with the MCM-41 support
(for example) shows a strong peak at about 2.5° (2θ) due
to (100) diffractions lines and weak peaks between 4 and 4.5°
(2θ) and between 4.5 and 5.2° (2θ) due to higher-order
(110) and (200) diffractions, respectively, indicating the formation
of well-ordered mesoporous materials. All of these patterns are assigned
to the hexagonal symmetry of MCM-41-type mesoporous silica.32

2.2 Reactions in the Autoclave
2.2.1 Model Feed
Diesel fractions contain a large number
of substituted condensed thiophenes.42 Typical
representatives of such compounds are DBT and its derivatives. DBT
molecules are resistant to hydrogenation due to steric hindrance,
so this compound was chosen as a model compound in the oxidation reaction
to sulfones.

The thermal destruction of DBT sulfone (DBTS) at
temperatures 300–450 °C was performed as a comparison
experiment (Table 2). The composition of the products was determined by gas chromatography
(GC).

It was revealed that at temperatures up to 350 °C
inclusive DBTS is stable under the given conditions. However, when
it reaches 400 °C or more, DBTS starts to decompose. A sharp
decrease in the amount of sulfone at 450 °C is due to the process
of thermal cracking in a solvent with the evolution of hydrogen, as
a result of which a reduction of DBTS to DBT takes place in a closed
system.

When studying the general trends of the catalytic destruction
of DBTS, the tests were first carried out with unsupported calcium
and magnesium oxides to compare with the published results.28,30 As shown by experiments, the degree of sulfone removal was 0% at
300 °C. This indicated the inapplicability of these oxides under
above conditions and the necessity of using a mesoporous carrier.
Thus, further studies on the catalytic degradation process were carried
out using the CaO/MCM-41 catalyst under various conditions of temperature,
reaction time, and catalyst/feedstock ratio. It was found that with
the increase of temperature (Table 3) the degree of sulfone removal increased, which is
partly due to the contribution of the thermal destruction process.

Experiments on varying the duration of the sulfone destruction
process were carried out at 300 and 400 °C. It was found that
as the reaction time increases the amount of the removed sulfone increases
at 400 °C (Figure 3).

Figure 3 DBTS Conversion in the
Presence of the CaO/MCM-41 Catalyst.

However, when the reaction is carried out at a lower temperature,
the degree of sulfone removal decreases with the increase of reaction
time. This fact can be explained by desorption of unreacted sulfone
from the pores of the carrier.

The composition of the reaction
mixture of catalytic degradation at 400 °C was investigated by
GC with a mass spectrometric detector, and it was found biphenyl as
the main product of the DBTS destruction (Figure S2). Moreover, DBT was observed as a byproduct in the mixture,
which can be explained by the reduction of the sulfone with hydrogen
liberated by partial cracking of hexadecane (a reaction solvent).

2.2.2 Real Feed
Experiments in the autoclave were also carried out on the thermal
and catalytic decomposition of oxidized sulfur compounds, which are
a part of the oxidized diesel fraction. Oxidation was conducted with
a homogeneous catalytic system (formic acid and hydrogen peroxide).
The oxidized diesel fraction was subjected to thermal decomposition
at 300 °C and catalytic decomposition at 300 and 400 °C
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 Sulfur content in the
products of the sulfone decomposition
at various temperature regimes (in real feedstock samples).

As
can be seen in Figure 4, the sulfur content is not decreased in the case of thermal decomposition
of fuel; however, with the addition of the catalyst, a sharp decrease
in the amount of sulfur in the product is observed, which is directly
related to the adsorption effect of the mesoporous carrier. The figure
shows that without heating the system about 60% of the sulfur compounds
are adsorbed inside the pores of the catalyst. When heated to 400
°C, the sulfur content decreases by 80%.

2.3 Reactions in the Flow System with
the Fixed-Bed Catalyst
Due to high contribution of adsorption
during reactions in an autoclave, catalytic tests of the catalysts
for the destruction of sulfones on real feedstock were carried out
in a flow system. The experiment was carried out at the operating
temperature of the process in the absence of a catalyst as a blank
test. These blank experiments were carried out at 300 and 400 °C.
The oxidized diesel fraction was passed through a heated steel reactor
in a circulating mode; after cooling, the reaction products were fed
by a pump to the feed tank, from which the mixture was fed back to
the reactor.

The samples are taken every 30 min, and the sulfur
concentration in the sample is measured. It is established that an
increase in temperature from 300 to 400 °C does not significantly
reduce the sulfur content of the product, but it accelerates the setting
of steady-state desulfurization (Figure 5). Furthermore, the oxidized diesel fraction
samples were desulfurized with the catalyst in a flow-through mode.
Based on the sulfur content of each sample, a kinetic curve is constructed
for each experiment. The typical kinetic curve is represented in Figure 6.

Figure 5 Desulfurization
in the
course of thermal destruction of feedstock in a flow reactor (blue
line, 300 °C; violet line, 400 °C).

Figure 6 Kinetic reaction curve
in the presence of MgO/Al-SBA-15
at 400 °C; LHSV = 20 h–1.

As can be
seen, sulfur concentration decreases steeply due to adsorption properties
of the support. The amount of adsorbed sulfur is approximately 1.6
mg/g of catalyst, which is typical for mesoporous materials.47 Then, fresh fuel stream elutes the adsorbed
substances and the decomposition of sulfones begins. The decomposition
of sulfur compounds occurs in the first 60 min of the experiment and
then proceeds to a certain final value, which is symbolized by the
gradual emergence of the kinetic curve on the plateau.

When
investigating the catalytic activity of the samples, Al-SBA-15- and
Al-MCM-41-supported catalysts were first compared. It revealed that
at 400 °C the decomposition degree of sulfones was almost the
same for both supports (60% for CaO and 69% for MgO). However, at
300 °C, Al-MCM-41-supported catalysts were more active (3% more
for CaO and 10% more for MgO). Then, MCM-41-supported catalysts were
tested for comparison with Al-MCM-41 ones. The results of catalytic
decomposition of sulfones in oxidized diesel fraction are summarized
in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Sulfur removal from oxidized
diesel in the presence
of synthesized catalysts.

As can be seen, optimal results on sulfur reduction in the fraction
can be achieved by magnesium oxide as an active component. The sample
containing BaO showed the worst conversion when compared to that containing
CaO and MgO. As for the carrier, it can be seen that the one without
Al shows better results. To study the dependence of mesoporous material
type in the support on the sulfur removal activity, additional investigations
were made. The acidity of the supports was measured using the thermoprogrammed
ammonia desorption technique (Table 4).

a Ammonia desorbed below 300 °C.

b Ammonia desorbed above 300 °C.

As can be seen from the table, the acidity
of the samples increases with the addition of alumina into the mesoporous
structure. That means that alkaline earth metals are more active in
the desulfonylation reaction when supported on a silica-based mesoporous
material rather than aluminosilicate one. Additional analysis was
made to compare the basicity of catalysts with that of mesoporous
supports. The basicity is characterized by chloroform adsorption using
IR spectroscopy. The CHCl3 molecule is used as a probe
that is adsorbed by basic sites of a catalyst. The position of the
C–H stretching vibration is shifted to the low-frequency region
relative to the chloroform band in the liquid phase (3033 cm–1) due to the interaction of hydrogen with the basic centers of the
catalyst. Therefore, the shift of the band for the studied samples
indicates the presence of the basic centers in them, and according
to the degree of the shift, the strength of these centers is estimated.48−50 IR spectra of adsorbed chloroform
on pure MCM-41 and CaO (MgO)/MCM-41 are represented in Figure 8.

Figure 8 IR spectra of adsorbed CHCl3 (peq = 2 Torr) on MCM-41 samples (spectra of the samples
before adsorption are subtracted).

For the MCM-41 sample,
only one band of 3031 cm–1 is fixed, the appearance
of which is accompanied by a decrease in the band of 3743 cm–1 of free silanol groups and the appearance of the 3687 cm–1 band (perturbed silanol groups). The negative area of the spectra
(3743 cm–1) corresponds to the reduced bands intensity
after the adsorption of the CHCl3. The frequency of C–H
vibrations, close to the vibration of chloroform in the liquid phase,
indicates a weak interaction of chloroform with the surface of the
support, probably through coordination with Si–OH groups. When
chloroform is adsorbed on samples MgO/MCM-41 and CaO/MCM-41, low-frequency
shoulders appear at 2994 and 2981 cm–1, respectively,
which indicate the presence of basic centers on these samples.49 Obtained data correlates with the literature28−30 where basic materials (catalysts)
are used for the desulfonylation reaction.

The degree of sulfur
removal in the sulfone destruction process is comparable to that in
oxidative desulfurization followed by adsorption or extraction.51 One of the main reasons for insufficient sulfur
removal is the incomplete oxidation of sulfur compounds. To prove
this hypothesis, infrared spectroscopy was carried out. IR spectra
of the diesel fraction before oxidation and after the sulfone destruction
process were taken. The results (Figure 9) show that the SO2 peaks (sulfones)
are not observed in the product, which means all of the oxidized sulfur
compounds are destroyed completely. The thiophene content is greatly
reduced, but the residual content is still observed in the product
of the reaction. This proves that the reaction of desulfonylation
effectively converts all of the oxidized sulfur compounds to the corresponding
sulfur-free hydrocarbons (in contrast to the adsorption or extraction
technique). However, to achieve full removal of sulfur, special conditions
are needed to oxidize the residual sulfur.

fuel before oxidation (left) and
after the reaction (right).

2.4 Catalysts and Feed Properties after the Reaction
The unloaded catalyst after the reaction was in the form of a powder
of dark gray color, which indicated that the feedstock was partly
resinified and coked during the reaction. The amount of coke was determined
by the thermogravimetric analysis–differential scanning calorimetry
method (Figure S3). The weight loss in
the first stage (to 290 °C) was 8.7%. In the second stage, in
the temperature range 290–640 °C, the loss was about 4.3%
(the maximum weight loss rate was observed at the temperature of about
490 °C). On the basis of the indicated data, it can be concluded
that coke formation on the catalyst occurs at a lower degree than
resinification of the feedstock.

For regenerated MgO/MCM-41
and CaO/MCM-41 catalysts, the textural characteristics were analyzed
by the method of low-temperature adsorption–desorption of nitrogen
(Table 5).

Table 5 Textural Characteristics of Catalysts
 	S (BET), m2/g	Vpores, cm3/g	Dpores, Å	
MgO/MCM-41 before reaction	508	0.42	50	
MgO/MCM-41 after regeneration	528	0.44	55	
CaO/MCM-41 before reaction	527	0.66	27	
CaO/MCM-41 after regeneration	377	0.70	30	
As
can be seen from the data, the specific surface area of the sample
MgO/MCM-41, along with the remaining characteristics, slightly increases.
In contrast, the CaO/MCM-41 catalyst decreases the value of the specific
surface area, but the pore diameter remains unchanged. An isotherm
of type IV with a hysteresis loop is observed for all samples. Taking
into account these data, the catalytic activity tests were carried
out using the regenerated MgO/MCM-41 catalyst (Figure 10).

Figure 10 Degree of sulfur removal
in the presence of fresh (A)
and regenerated catalysts (B) in flow mode.

With the use of the regenerated
catalyst, the conversion of sulfur compounds is reduced at 300 and
400 °C by 3 and 4.5%, respectively. The test on the catalyst
activity
was made additionally at 400 °C during four more recycles. After
each recycle, the catalyst was regenerated in the air flow at 650
°C. The results of several recycles show that the catalyst activity
is retained; however, it is slightly lower than that in the first
run (Figure 11).

Figure 11 MgO/MCM-41 catalyst
recycle tests at
400 °C; LHSV = 20 h–1.

The fractional composition of the hydrocarbon fraction was investigated
by the simulated distillation method. The original diesel fraction
before oxidation, the oxidized fraction that served as the feedstock
for the reaction, and the product mixture after the reaction (at 300
and 400 °C) were studied (Table 6).

Table 6 Characteristics

mixture of products (test using MgO/Al-SBA-15 cat.; 400 °C)	21	73.2	5.8	
As a result of the reaction at 400 °C,
the yield of the diesel fraction does not decrease. However, at 300
°C, there is a slight decrease in the fraction (350 °C to
EBP), which can be explained by partial resinification of heavier
components of the fraction and deposition on the catalyst.

3 Conclusions
In
this study, different catalysts for sulfone destruction were synthesized
and characterized. The experiment on model feed showed that the mesoporous
carrier was essential for sulfur removal from DBT sulfone and other
sulfones contained in diesel fractions. The use of the mesoporous
material also aids in reducing the active component content that is
needed for efficient removal of oxidized sulfur compounds (compared
to literature data24). A comparison between
different catalyst supports revealed that mesoporous materials containing
silica show better results in the desulfonylation reaction due to
its low acidity.

Thus, the use of sulfone destruction catalysts
based on mesoporous materials makes it possible to achieve a reduction
in the sulfur content in diesel fuel by 75%. The degree of sulfur
removal is comparable to adsorption or extraction methods while
saving valuable hydrocarbons in diesel fuel. The mesoporous structure
of the catalyst is not destroyed, and the fractional composition of
diesel fuel remains practically unchanged.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Catalysts based
on MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 were prepared using the impregnation procedure
with excess of water. Mesoporous materials MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 were
synthesized previously using standard techniques.52,53 Mg,
Ca, and Ba oxides were incorporated using water-soluble salts: Mg(OAc)2·4H2O, Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, and Ba(OAc)2·3H2O, respectively.
The calculation was carried out on the oxide content in the catalyst
in amount of 10%. The mixture of catalyst and impregnation solution
was stirred for 4 h without heating. Excess of water was vapored using
a rotary evaporator. The solid residue was dried at 110 °C for
2 h and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 4 h.

Catalysts based on Al-SBA-15 were synthesized by the direct synthesis
method. In a typical synthesis, the mixture of (EtO)4Si
(TEOS) and (sec-BuO)3Al was added to a dilute solution
of HCl (pH = 1.5). Then, Pluronic P123 polymer was dissolved in a
HCl solution (pH 1.5). Portion of Mg(OAc)2·4H2O (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) was
then added to the Pluronic P123 solution. Then, a mixture of silicon
and aluminum compounds in a dilute HCl solution was added to the solution
of the template and the metal salt at 40 °C and was stirred for
3 h. The flask was sealed, placed in an oven, and held for 48 h at
95 °C. The resulting precipitate was evaporated on a rotary evaporator
and air-dried. The sample was then dried for 5 h at 90 °C, for
2 h at 110 °C, heated in a muffle furnace at a rate of 1 °C/min
to 600 °C, and calcined at this temperature in air for 4 h. Reagents
quantities used for synthesis are given in Table S1.

4.2 Characterization
Adsorption/desorption isotherms of nitrogen were determined at
77 K using a Micromeritics Gemini VII 2390t equipment. Before measurements,
the samples were degassed at 350 °C for 6 h. To calculate the
surface area, the BET method was applied with adsorption data in the
range of relative pressures (P/P0) of 0.04–0.20. The pore volume and the pore size
distribution were determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherms
using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model. The specific
volume of the pores was determined based on the amount of adsorbed
nitrogen at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99.

The transmission electron microscopy
analysis was performed using a LEO 912 ABOMEGA apparatus, with magnification
from 80 to 500 000× and image resolution of 0.2–0.34
nm.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a
Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200 apparatus (Cu Kα radiation) in the 2θ
range of 5–100°, with a goniometer (Rigaku D/Max-RC) at
a rotation speed of 1° 2θ/min and a step of 0.04°.

The content of silicon, aluminum, magnesium, calcium, and barium
was measured by an iCAP-6500 Duo atomic emission analyzer from Thermo
Fisher Scientific with a plasma source of radiation (ICP-AES). The
analyzed sample was transformed into a soluble state; then, the solution
was sprayed with a strong argon stream and subjected to a stream of
atomization gas in a spark discharge. Radiation in the near ultraviolet
and visible region (166–847 nm) emitted by the probe was compared
with the emission of standards with a known content of the analyzed
elements.

The acidity of mesoporous materials was determined
by the NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) method
with a USGA-101 instrument (UNISIT, Russia). The test sample of ∼0.1
g with a particle size of 0.5–0.25 mm was placed in a quartz
reactor and treated in a flow of helium at 500 °C for 1 h with
subsequent blowing by nitrogen. Saturation was performed in a flow
of dried ammonia diluted with nitrogen at the temperature of 60 °C
for 15 min. Physically adsorbed ammonia was removed at 100 °C
in a flow (30 mL/min) of dry helium for 1 h. For obtaining a TPD curve,
the sample was cooled down to 50–60 °C and then the temperature
was ramped (8 °C/min) up to 500 °C.

The basicity of
catalysts was measured by the chloroform chemisorption method. The
sorption degree was detected by IR spectroscopy with a Nicolet Protégé
460 spectrometer (optical resolution, 4 cm–1; range,
4000–400 cm–1). Samples were activated in
the IR cell at 400 °C (7.5 °C/min heating rate) and 10–5 Torr during 1 h. Chloroform adsorption was carried
out at room temperature by addition of CHCl3 portions until
the equilibrium pressure was 2 Torr.

4.3 Activity Measurement
Thermal and catalytic
decomposition reactions were carried out in a stirred stainless steel
autoclave (45 cm3) wherein 0.1 g of catalyst powder and
4 mL of model feed were placed. To prepare the model feed, DBT sulfone
was dissolved in a solvent mixture consisting of 70 vol % benzene
and 30 vol % hexadecane. The benzene/hexadecane ratio was selected
based on solubility of the amount of sulfone required to produce a
mixture with the elemental sulfur content of 500 ppm. While using
real feedstock (oxidized diesel fraction), the amounts of catalyst
and feedstock were increased by
2 times.

Reactions in the flow system were carried out in a
laboratory catalytic unit with a fixed-bed catalyst at atmospheric
pressure. The tests were carried out at 300 and 400 °C. Samples
were taken after 15, 30, and 60 min of the feedstock time-on-stream
and then hourly. The experiments were performed until the sulfur content
in two subsequent samples differed less than 5 ppm.

The reaction
product composition of model mixtures and control of the purity of
starting materials was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using “Kristall-2000M”
with the flame ionization detector (glass capillary column, l = 30 m, d = 0.32 mm, liquid phase ZB-1,
thermoprogrammed from 100 to 250 °C, and nitrogen as a carrier
gas).

Chromass spectrometry was performed with a LECO Pegasus
4D instrument for one-dimensional chromatography in electron impact
mode with an ionizing radiation energy of 70 eV. Separation by GC
was carried out on a silicone capillary column Rxi-5Sil MS (30 m,
diameter 0.25 mm) thermoprogrammed from 50 °C (for 2 min) to
280 °C (for 5 min) with a rate of 20 °C/min. The scanned
masses are 29–500 Da.

Sulfur concentration in liquid
products was determined using an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescent
sulfur analyzer by ASTM D4294.54

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of diesel fractions were
recorded on a Nicolet IR200 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 500–4000
cm–1.

The fractional composition of the possible
liquid products was obtained by simulated distillation by ASTM D288755 using a Chromos GC-1000 chromatograph.

The coke content in the catalyst was determined gravimetrically using
an SDT Q600 device from Thermal Analysis Instruments. The temperature
ramp was 5 °C/min in the air flow up to 800 and 1000 °C.
