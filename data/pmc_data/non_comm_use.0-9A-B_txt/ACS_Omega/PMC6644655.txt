We
report on extreme penetration power of relativistic electrons
in a micrometer-thick gallium nitride epitaxial film and its application
to probing threading dislocations, which were introduced during crystal
growth. Maximum usable thickness of the specimen was quantitatively
evaluated using high-voltage transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
operating at 1 MV. The width of dislocation images was used as a measure
for the evaluation of usable thickness. Superior maximum usable thickness
was obtained in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) than
in TEM mode; the results were 6.9 μm for STEM and 4.4 μm
for TEM. In STEM, dislocations can be imaged with an almost constant
width of 15–20 nm in a wide thickness range 1–4 μm.
The latest high-voltage STEM is thus useful for observing dislocations
in micrometer-thick inorganic materials.

Introduction
Dislocations in a semiconductor crystal,
such as gallium nitride
(GaN), degrade its optical and electrical properties. The key to the
development of high-performance light-emitting and electronic devices
is the growth of highly complete crystals with a low dislocation density.1 To detect and characterize lattice defects in
a crystalline solid, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful
technique in respect of spatial resolution compared to other methods
such as X-ray topography.2 Imaging of dislocations
by TEM is based on diffraction contrast, and the procedure has been
established.3 To visualize spatial distribution
of dislocations, a novel approach was examined using electron tomography,
which revealed three-dimensional dislocation networks in GaN.4 However, electron transmittance limits the maximum
usable (or observable) thickness of the specimen at most ∼0.3
μm in the case of conventional 200 kV TEM (this was examined
by our preliminary study). The importance of observing sufficiently
thick specimens that can be regarded as bulk was proved half a century
ago using high-voltage electron microscopy (HVEM); namely, solid-state
phenomena such as recrystallization, phase transition, and dynamic
behaviors of crystal dislocations in metal foils thinner than a critical
thickness differ from those observed in the bulk alloys.5 In the years around 1970, considerable interest
was focused on investigating the maximum usable thickness using HVEM.6−11 However, the penetration of relativistic electrons depends on imaging
conditions as well as materials,12,13 and quantitative
unified views regarding the maximum usable thickness have not been
obtained. As mentioned above, the history of this topic is long over
50 years; however, recent interest in crystal defects and internal
structures in semiconductor devices has drawn renewed attention to
visualizing microstructures in an extremely thick specimen by HVEM.14,15

Recently, the authors reported that high-voltage (HV) scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is capable of imaging dislocations
in Si(110) crystals over 14 μm in thickness.16 In principle, STEM has the benefit of being free from the
effect of chromatic aberration since there is no imaging lens. Moreover,
the technique is known to be less affected by the unfavorable diffraction
contrast such as equal-thickness contour or bend contour (the word
“unfavorable” is used here in a sense that aforementioned
contours prevent clear-cut visualization of crystal defects such as
dislocations).17,18 This is due to the nature of
STEM imaging using a converged electron probe. HV-STEM is hence the
suitable imaging technique that can reveal the microstructures of
a micrometer-order thick specimen in a nanometer-scale spatial resolution
as well as a multiscale field of view.

In this study, we examined
quantitative assessment of the maximum
usable thickness of a GaN crystal with high-density threading dislocations
(TDs) using HV-STEM and HV-TEM. TDs in GaN are mostly straight lines,
and hence, they are expected to act as a good marker for discriminating
transmittance of electrons. We show superior usable thickness in HV-STEM
than in HV-TEM, and the obtained results are discussed.

Results
Figure 1a shows
a secondary electron image of a wedge-shaped GaN crystal observed
in an oblique direction. An isosceles triangle cross section is suitable
for the systematic investigation of the usable thickness by HVEM.
Cross section of the wedge-shaped specimen is schematically shown
in Figure 1b. Electrons
are incident on the wedge-shaped crystal from the direction indicated
by an arrow, and also from the opposite direction for comparison.
Thickness of the wedge-shaped specimen changes from 0.5 to 8.3 μm.

direction. (b) Schematic illustration of the cross section of the
wedge-shaped specimen.

Figure 2a
shows
a bright-field (BF) STEM image of the wedge-shaped GaN with high-density
TDs. The specimen becomes thicker from the right (0.5 μm) to
the left (2.5 μm) of the image. Appearance of the specimen and
the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern are shown in Figure 2b,c, respectively.
We subjected a specimen to a two-beam condition by exciting the 1̅100
reflection. TDs are seen as lines almost parallel to [0001]GaN with dark contrast in a bright background, and the dislocation images
become blurred as the thickness increases. Judging from the invisibility
criterion for wurtzite GaN,19,20 these TDs in GaN are
almost either a-type (threading-edge) or a+c-type (threading-mixed).
Note that c-type (threading-screw) TDs were identified by exciting
0002 reflection as well, while their number was a few. Then, the specimen
was turned upside down and comparable observation was made (Figure 2d–f). In Figure 2d, the specimen becomes
thicker from the left (0.5 μm) to the right (2.5 μm) of
the image. It was found that the same dislocations were identified
both in Figure 2d,a
in the area with thickness at least less than 2.5 μm. Dislocation
width was not affected by the observation direction to the specimen.
It should also be noted that the width of dislocation images is independent
of collection semiangle of the BF-STEM detector in the range of 4–25
mrad. As the collection semiangle increases, image intensity enhances,
which leads to a brighter image contrast.

TDs, (b, e) appearance of the specimen, and (c, f) SAED patterns.

Figure 3 shows a
composite BF-STEM image showing overall area of the wedge-shaped GaN
specimen. The contrast of each image was adjusted locally to show
the dislocations clearly. The specimen becomes thicker from the right
(0.5 μm) to the left (8.3 μm) of the image. Dislocation
density was on the order of 1012 m–2 and
was almost constant, regardless of the thickness, while apparent areal
number density of TDs gradually increased as the thickness increased.
On the basis of the analysis of areal number density of TDs, we found
that overlapping of TDs in the observation direction is negligible,
and hence, it little affects evaluation of the width of dislocation
images. Dislocation images become blurred as the thickness increases.
A notable feature is that it is possible to judge whether TDs exist
even in the thick region with thickness around 7 μm. This is
the direct evidence that 1 MeV electrons can transmit a 7 μm
thick GaN crystal. More quantitative evaluation of the usable thickness
is shown in Figure 6.

GaN specimen (g = 1̅100).

Figure 4 shows
a
composite BF-TEM image showing overall area of the wedge-shaped GaN,
corresponding to the STEM images shown in Figure 3. Dislocation images are almost invisible
at thickness around 5 μm, indicating the superior usable thickness
in STEM (i.e., Figure 3) than in TEM (i.e., Figure 4). Namely, usable thickness depends on the imaging mode, converged
beam, or parallel beam, while the electron energy is the same in both
cases (1 MeV).

GaN specimen (g = 1̅100).

Figure 5a,b
compare
BF-STEM and BF-TEM images of the same area with thickness of 0.8–2.2
μm. As can be seen, same dislocations are imaged in STEM and
TEM modes, and this tendency was observed in the thickness range up
to 4 μm. Thus, reciprocity of BF-STEM and BF-TEM can be confirmed
qualitatively. Note that the dislocation image contrast in STEM is
slightly sharper than that obtained in TEM. We found that annular
dark-field (ADF) STEM at 1 MV was not useful for imaging dislocations
in a thick specimen in respect of low detection efficiency due to
weak intensity of an ADF-STEM signal. Namely, sufficient signal strength
is mandatory for imaging microstructures in a micrometer-order thick
specimen.

Figure 5 Comparison of (a) BF-STEM and (b) BF-TEM images obtained for the
same area (g = 1̅100).

To quantitatively evaluate usable thickness, we measured
width
of dislocation images as a function of the specimen thickness. The
width is defined as full width at half-maximum of the image intensity
profile measured perpendicular to a dislocation line. Figure 6 shows the thickness dependence of the width of dislocation
images measured from the STEM and TEM images. To avoid ambiguity regarding
the visibility of dislocations, we introduced a criterion for the
evaluation of usable thickness: theoretical dislocation width ξhkl/π (ξhkl stands for the extinction distance of the hkl reflection
excited for imaging)21 was employed as
the criterion. Dashed line indicates the criterion ξ 1̅100/π = 28.2 nm (ξ 1̅100 = 88.6 nm at 1
MV for GaN), and we judged that data points below this line are “observable”.
As seen, width of dislocation images increases as the thickness increases.
The obtained maximum usable thickness is 6.9 μm for BF-STEM
and 4.4 μm for BF-TEM operating at 1 MV.

from STEM and TEM images (g = 1̅100).

Discussion
Focusing on the results
of STEM, in the thickness range between
1 and 4 μm, we found that the width of dislocation images shows
weak thickness dependence and the values are distributed around 15–20
nm. This result may be related to the depth of focus of STEM. Let
us consider a STEM probe with the convergence semiangle α and
depth of focus Δz. Assuming the smallest converged
STEM probe (approximately 1 nm at 1 MV in the present experimental
setup), a depth of focus as short as 110 nm is derived using the following
equation 1  where λ denotes the wavelength
of incident
electrons.22,23 However, same dislocations were
observed irrespective of the beam incidence direction to the wedge-shaped
specimen with the thickness less than 2.5 μm, which is 23 times
longer than the short depth of focus estimated above (Figure 2). This result suggests that
Δz defined by the eq 1 no longer serves as an indicator of the usable
thickness. By contrast, assuming an object with a lateral length d, the extended depth of focus can be approximated as follows16,22 2  When d is equal to the width
of dislocation image and by assigning the values of d = 20 nm and α = 3.75 mrad, Δzext = 5.3 μm is obtained. Namely, if we accept the blurring of
the dislocation images at most 20 nm, a specimen with thickness up
to approximately 5 μm can be imaged in focus using 1 MV STEM.
This is a simple geometrical consideration but in good agreement with
the experimental result shown above.

As the thickness increases
more than 4 μm, the distribution
of the width of dislocation images spreads rapidly (Figure 6). This is presumed to be due
to possible lateral spread of the STEM probe (δ) proportional
to t3/2 (t denotes thickness
of the specimen).24 The solid curve shown
in Figure 6 represents
the fitted curve expressed as follows 3  As can be seen, beam broadening well represents
the distribution of the data points for STEM.

Transmitted (T) and diffracted beam intensities
(R) for 1 MV TEM were calculated by solving the Darwin–Howie–Whelan
equations under a two-beam condition including absorption.3 The T and R are expressed as follows18 4   5  where s is the excitation
error, ξ0 is the extinction distance of the forward
scattering, ξg is the extinction distance of the
diffracted beam, ξ0′ and ξg′ are attenuation terms of ξ0 and ξg due to absorption, and t is the thickness
that electrons propagate, with abbreviations μ0 =
2π/ξ0′, μg = 2π/ξg′, and w = sξg. Figure 7a
shows calculated thickness dependence of the T and R, assuming ξg = 88.6 nm (for g = 1̅100GaN at 1 MV), ξg/ξg′ = 0.10, ξ0′ = ξg′, and w = 0.40. Under these conditions, T reproduces the experimental result, i.e., T = 0.05 at t = 4.4 μm (=50ξg). Note that we assumed a criterion that the minimum of 5% of the
transmitted beam should remain, and below which the image contrast
is invisible. Intensity oscillations for both T and R are due to the equal-thickness fringes.

Figure 7b shows the parameter w dependence
of T calculated for t = 6ξg, 12ξg, and 50ξg at 1 MV.
The peak position shifts toward w > 0, especially
for t = 6ξg and 12ξg. This represents the well-known fact that, for BF-TEM imaging in
a two-beam condition, the best transmission can be obtained when s is slightly positive.3 As the
thickness increases, the peak position of the T shifts
toward w = 0 and the peak height reduces. The calculation
revealed that, to obtain the best transmission, fine adjustment of
the parameter s, as possible as one can, is effective,
depending on the specimen thickness. However, it should be noted that
it is practically difficult to see diffracted beams when specimen
thickness becomes fairly thick (e.g., t = 50ξg).

(b) Parameter w (=sξg) dependence of T at 1 MV.

In this study, superior usable thickness in STEM to that
in TEM
was found, as shown in Figure 6. The similar tendency was obtained in our previous study
on Si(110) wedge-shaped crystals,16 where
the effect of the spatial distribution of dislocations was not considered
explicitly. By contrast, distribution of TDs in GaN can be regarded
as statistically homogeneous; the results shown in Figure 6 are not affected by the spatial
distribution of TDs.

In TEM observation, chromatic aberration
arising from the postspecimen
lens seriously degrades the resolution when observing a thick specimen.
However, as already mentioned in the Introduction section, STEM requires no imaging lens for electrons transmitted
through a specimen. Therefore, STEM is practically free from the effect
of chromatic aberration, which may cause the superior usable thickness.
From the viewpoint of chromatic aberration, the use of an energy filter
(EF), which is based on electron energy-loss spectroscopy and hence
inelastic scattering electrons can be either removed or selected,
is also an effective solution. Using an EFTEM operating at 1.25 MV,
Sadamatsu et al. reported a unique imaging technique incorporating
inelastic scattering electrons; dislocations in a thick Si(001) over
10 μm have been imaged where zero-loss signal was absent.25 Note that the maximum usable thickness of a
wedge-shaped Si(110) crystal was 14.7 μm for 1 MV STEM.16 Currently, HV-STEM and HV-EFTEM are useful methods
for imaging microstructures in an extremely thick specimen, and a
direct comparison between these two techniques regarding merits and
demerits has not been examined yet, which will be clarified by investigations
in the future.

Conclusions
We have studied the
maximum usable thickness of the wedge-shaped
GaN crystal in 1 MV STEM and 1 MV TEM using the width of dislocation
images as a criterion for the quantitative evaluation. Superior usable
thickness in STEM to that in TEM mode was demonstrated; the obtained
results were 6.9 μm for STEM and 4.4 μm for TEM. In STEM
mode, same dislocations were identified, regardless of the beam incidence
direction to the wedge-shaped specimen when the thickness is less
than 2.5 μm. Reciprocity of BF-STEM and BF-TEM was confirmed
qualitatively as the same dislocations were imaged in STEM and TEM
modes in the thickness range up to 4 μm. Intensity simulation
reproduced the extreme penetration power of 1 MeV electrons. Fine
adjustment of the excitation error is effective to obtain the best
transmission.

Experimental Procedures
TEM Specimen Preparation
To quantitatively evaluate
the usable thickness by HV-STEM, we studied a heteroepitaxial GaN
film grown on α-Al2O3(0001). Wedge-shaped
specimens were fabricated from the GaN film using a focused ion beam
system. The specimen shapes were characterized using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) operating at 10 kV.

Characterization
Dislocations in a GaN film were observed
using a JEOL JEM-1000EES operating at 1 MV equipped with a LaB6 cathode. We subjected a specimen to a two-beam condition
by exciting the 1̅100 or 11̅00 reflection of wurtzite
GaN. BF-TEM images were obtained using a 20 μm objective aperture
with a semiangle of 2.8 mrad, and they were recorded using a 2k ×
2k charge-coupled device camera (Gatan Orius SC200D) with an exposure
time of 1–180 s. In the BF-STEM imaging, the beam convergence
was set to a semiangle of 3.75 mrad using a 50 μm condenser
aperture and the outer collection angle on the BF detector was set
to 4–25 mrad. STEM images 1k × 1k in size were acquired
with a dwell time of 256–1365 μs/pixel, depending on
the specimen thickness.
