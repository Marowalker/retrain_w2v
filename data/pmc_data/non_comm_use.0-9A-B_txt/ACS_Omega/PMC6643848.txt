Stable compositions and structures
of copper oxide cluster cations
have been studied by ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMMS) and density
functional theory calculations. Cluster ions of the series CunOm+ were
predominantly observed with n:m ≈ 2:1 in the
mass spectrum. Collision cross sections (CCSs) of the cluster ions
with n:m ≈ 2:1, determined by IMMS, were found
to increase monotonically with cluster size. In addition, the CCSs
of CunOn+ and CunOn–1+ (n = 2–8) were
examined, and stepwise increases were observed for CunOn–1+ series. These cluster structures were assigned by comparison of
the CCSs obtained via the IMMS experiment with theoretical orientation-averaged
CCSs of optimized structures.

1 Introduction
Copper
oxides exist as stable Cu2O(I) and CuO(II) in
the bulk phase. These copper oxides are widely used in various catalytic
reactions,1−5 semiconducting materials,6,7 environmental protection,8−11 and energy storage and conversion12,13 systems. Understanding
the properties of copper oxide surfaces may us help to elucidate their
reactivity for different purposes. One of the fundamental ways to
elucidate the behavior of the surface structures and details of their
functional mechanism is to study gas-phase clusters. Such studies
of copper oxide clusters give valuable insights into stabilities and
reactions at the microscopic level, allowing size, stoichiometry,
and oxidation states of the clusters to be selected according to research
objectives. The geometrical structures of copper oxide clusters are
the key parameters for understanding the catalytic reactivity of surface
redox reactions. Moreover, information on structural changes that
occur with varying cluster size is also valuable in application, because
nanosized materials are expected to have functions that depend on
their geometrical structures. Keeping these points in mind, many researchers
have studied gas-phase copper oxide clusters during the past few decades.14−22

Experimentally, copper oxide cluster cations have been studied
by mass spectrometry (MS) to determine the distributions of its sizes
and compositions.14−17 More explicitly, Freiser et al. investigated collision-induced dissociation
(CID) of CunOm± cluster ions produced by laser desorption/ionization
of copper oxide pellets.14 Aubriet et al.,15 Ma et al.,16 and
Mafuné et al.17 determined the compositions
of copper oxide cluster cations generated by laser ablation processes.
They presented the stoichiometric compositions as an oxygen-deficient
class, CunOm+ (n > m), such as
Cu2O+, Cu3O+, Cu4O2+, Cu5O2–3+, Cu6O3–4+, etc. Moreover,
recently Hirabayashi and Ichihashi18 and
Mafuné et al.19 reported the reactions
of CunOm+ cluster species with NO. They found that the CunOm+ cluster
ions readily react with NO and that the NO oxidation proceeds in the
reaction with some specific sizes of clusters, such as Cu4O3+, Cu6O5+, etc.18 For further investigations, a
number of theoretical studies were also done mainly on compositional
growth and their structures. Jadraque and Martín reported theoretical
calculations for stable structures of the (Cu2O)n/2+ and [(Cu2O)(n−1)/2Cu]+ series, which were considered
to consist of Cu2O as a building block.20 Yang et al. studied the ground-state structures of small
copper oxide clusters, Cu2Om (m = 1–4), through density functional theory
(DFT) calculations21 and found linear or
near-linear structures. Hall et al. investigated copper oxide cluster
cations, CunOn+ (n = 1–8), and found that the
clusters are planar up to n = 3.22

Most of the previous studies involved structural
assignments based
on theoretical calculations, and there have been few experimental
studies on stable stoichiometric composition and geometric structures;
even those were combined with theoretical calculations. In the present
study, stoichiometric compositions and size-dependent structures of
copper oxide cluster cations have been investigated by ion mobility
mass spectrometry (IMMS).

IMMS, a combination of ion mobility
spectrometry (IMS) and MS,
is a useful analytical method to study the structures of gas-phase
ions.23−25 In the conventional drift-tube-type IMS, an ion packet
is injected into a gas cell (ion-drift cell) in which an electrostatic
field is applied. Due to a mutual effect of acceleration of ions by
the electrostatic field, E, and deceleration by collisions
with buffer gas atoms in the cell, the drift velocity of the ions, vd, becomes a constant proportional to E, i.e., 1  in which the coefficient K is defined as ion mobility.26

The
equation for the ion mobility K of thermalized
ions traveling through the buffer gas in the electrostatic field is
given from the kinetic theory of ion transport as 2  where e is
the elementary charge, N is the number density of
the buffer gas atoms, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, μ is the reduced mass of the ion and the buffer gas
atom, and Ω is the collision integral, representing an average
of momentum transfer cross sections over collision energies and orientations.26 When we treat the ion and neutral parts as hard
spheres without internal states, the collision integral can be reduced
to the hard-sphere collision cross section (CCS). The term Teff, the effective temperature of the ions,
is given by TBG + MBvd2/3kB, where TBG is the buffer
gas temperature and MB is the mass of
the buffer gas. Thus, the time that the ion spends in the ion-drift
cell is inversely proportional to K and directly
proportional to Ω, as derived from eqs 1and 2.27 Therefore, the CCS of the ion
can be evaluated by measuring the ion mobility in the drift cell.

Recently, we studied the structures of metal oxide cluster ions
of first-row transition metals, such as, Zn,28 Co,29 Fe,30 Ni,31 Ti,32 V,33 and Cr,34 by IMMS. Transitions from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional
(3D) structures were commonly observed in the cluster ions of oxides
of the metals of the latter half of this row.28−31 In the present study, the structures
of copper oxide cluster cations, CunOm+, have been studied by IMMS. Experimental
CCSs of these cluster ions were determined by measuring the ion mobility.
In addition, theoretical CCSs were calculated by the MOBCAL program35 for optimized structures obtained by theoretical
calculations. By comparing CCSs experimentally measured by IMMS and
theoretically calculated CCSs for optimized structures, we are able
to assign geometrical structures of the cluster ions. We discuss the
structures of two different metal-to-oxygen ratios because the copper
oxide exists as two stable oxides—Cu2O and CuO—in
the condensed phase. In the present study, CCSs and structures of
stable compositions of CunOm+ with n:m ≈ 2:1
(building unit: Cu2O) and other cluster series, like CunOn+ with n:m = 1:1 (building unit: CuO) and CunOn–1+ (comprising
both Cu2O and CuO), are assigned up to n = 8. The obtained structures are discussed as a function of the
cluster size, and these structures are compared with the previous
results for copper oxide cluster ions.

2 Experimental
Methods
IMMS experiments were performed using a vacuum apparatus
composed
of a source of cluster ions, an ion-drift cell, and a reflectron-type
time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. Copper oxide cluster cations,
CunOm+, were formed by a combination of laser vaporization of a
copper rod and supersonic expansion of 5% O2/He mixture
gas (stagnation pressure was 2 atm). Cluster ions were introduced
to the ion-drift cell with injection energies, Einj, of 50 and 250 eV by applying a pulsed electric field at
a given time (t = t0).
The ion-drift cell with length L = 100 mm was filled
with He buffer gas (0.80 Torr). The cell was kept at 180 K by cooling
with liquid N2. The electrostatic field in the cell was E = 10 V/cm. After running through the cell, at a later
time after the ion-injection pulse, t = t0 + Δt, the cluster ions were accelerated
to ∼1.8 keV by another pulsed electrostatic field in an acceleration
region of the TOF mass spectrometer. We defined this delay time, Δt, as the “arrival time”. We calculated the
actual time that an ion spends in the cell (drift time, td) from the arrival time by solving the equations of motion
of the cluster ion, as explained in the Supporting Information. Because td depends
on the CCS between the ion and the He atom, cluster ions with different
CCSs arrive at the source region of the TOF mass spectrometer at different
arrival times. The cluster ions in this region were then mass-analyzed
by the reflectron-type TOF mass spectrometer. In the IMMS measurement,
we obtained TOF mass spectra sequentially by scanning the arrival
times. As a result, cluster ions with different CCSs were detected
separately at different arrival times in a 2D plot of TOF versus arrival
time. We compiled an arrival time distribution (ATD) of cluster ions,
in which the total ion intensity of a certain TOF peak is shown as
a function of arrival time.

The ratio of the drift electrostatic
field, E,
to the number density of buffer gas atoms, N, is
an important parameter in ion mobility measurements. The E/N values were, in general, kept low, at 1.5–10
Td (1 Td (Townsend unit) = 10–17 V·cm2).36,37 It is necessary to keep E/N low in the measurement of reliable CCSs of cluster
ions in the low-field limit (E/N → 0 Td) because the mobility of ions in high E/N conditions deviates from the data in the low
field. However, the cluster-ion concentration decreases at low E/N conditions because of scattering attributed
to lots of collisions with the buffer gas. Thus, we optimized the
highest possible E/N conditions
for determining the structures of cluster ions. The E/N conditions were kept at 23 Td in the present
measurement by setting buffer-gas pressure and temperature in the
ion-drift cell at 0.80 Torr and 180 K, respectively. Under these conditions,
the effective temperature of the Cu4O2+ ion, for example, was estimated to be about 240 K. These conditions
have already been confirmed as reliable to measure precise CCSs of
ions by the author’s group.38

3 Computational Methods
Density functional theory calculations
for optimization of the
structures of copper oxide cluster ions, CunOm+, were performed prior
to the calculations of the CCSs of the cluster ions. The optimizations
were carried out by using the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level in Gaussian 09.39 We used singlet and doublet as spin multiplicities
for even and odd numbers of copper atoms, respectively. The calculated
relative energy (ΔE) of each isomeric structure
was also taken under consideration to find the relative stability
of optimized structures. Theoretical CCSs, Ωcalc,
for those optimized structures were next calculated by using the MOBCAL35 program. The collision integral of an ion with
a He atom was calculated by the trajectory method (TM) which is included
in the program. In the TM calculation of copper oxide cluster ions,
the interaction potential between a CunOm+ cluster ion and a He atom
was needed to calculate the CCSs. This interaction potential was represented
by the sum of interaction potentials between constituent atoms (Cu
and O atoms) and a He atom, ViCu–He(ri) and ViO–He(ri), as shown in eq 3, 3  where ri is the distance between the ith constituent
atom and a He atom, εX–He and σX–He are the Lennard-Jones parameters, α is the
polarizability of a He atom, and qi is
the atomic charge on the ith atom. In the present
calculations, we used the εX–He values which
were reported previously from theoretical calculations (εCu–He = 0.773 meV and εO–He =
2.596 meV).40,41 For σX–He, we used the sum of van der Waals radii of Cu or O atoms (2.00 or
1.52 Å) with He (1.40 Å) (σCu–He = 3.40 Å and σO–He = 2.92 Å).42,43 Atomic charges calculated by natural population analysis were used
for qi. The temperature was 180 K in the
calculations. The uncertainty of the calculated CCS was about 1 Å2 when the CCS value was 50 Å2. In eq 3 of
ref (35), σ is
defined as the distance (r0) where the
potential becomes positive. However, when we used the distance r0 in CCS calculations, CCSs were calculated
6–10 Å2 larger than CCSs in the present study.
Because it was impossible to assign structures of cluster ions with
these large CCSs, we used the sum of van der Waals radii instead of r0 in the present CCS calculations.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Mass Spectra of Cluster
Cations
Stoichiometric
compositions are discussed in this section, based on the mass spectra
obtained in the IMMS measurement, as shown in Figure 1, mainly from the injection energy dependence
of the cluster ions moving into the ion-drift cell. Some metal oxide
cluster ions have tendencies to be populated to specific compositions
with increasing injection energy because of CID just after their injection
into the ion-drift cell before thermalization. In the present apparatus,
TOF mass spectra of copper oxide cluster cations were obtained by
summing all the ion signals at every arrival time existing in the
ion-drift cell with spatial distributions depending on their mobilities.

Figure 1 Typical
mass spectra of copper oxide cluster cations after collisions
with buffer gas atoms in the ion-drift cell. Ion-injection energies
(Einj) were (a) 250 and (b) 50 eV. The
pressure of the buffer gas and temperature of the ion-drift cell were
0.80 Torr and 180 K, respectively.

At the 250 eV injection energy condition for the mass spectra
shown
in Figure 1a, oxygen-deficient
clusters of CunOm+ showed intense signals up to n = 12.
More specifically, Cu+, Cu2O+, Cu3O+, Cu4O2+, Cu5Om+ (m = 2, 3), Cu6Om+ (m = 3, 4), Cu7Om+ (m = 3, 4), Cu8Om+ (m =
4, 5), Cu9Om+ (m = 4–6), Cu10Om+ (m = 5, 6), Cu11Om+ (m = 6, 7), and
Cu12Om+ (m = 6–8) were observed in the TOF mass spectrum.
We hereafter denote the CunOm+ ion as (n, m) in the figures. These ions can be classified as (Cu2O)n/2+ (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12), CunO(n–1)/2+ (n = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), and CunO(n+1)/2+ (n =
5, 7, 9, and 11). Except for some large cluster ions with more oxygens
such as (n, m) = (9, 6), (11, 7),
the ion species observed at this injection energy show metal-to-oxygen
ratios of ∼ 2:1.

In addition to the mass spectra obtained
at 250 eV injection energy,
the mass spectra at the lower injection energy of 50 eV are shown
in Figure 1b. At this
energy, a variety of cluster species were observed in the mass spectrum
than were not seen in that taken at 250 eV. Such cluster species can
be classified into several series, for example, oxygen-rich ions,
CunOn+1+ (n = 4, 5), and oxygen-equivalent ions,
CunOn+ (n = 2–8). Oxygen-deficient ions
were also observed in the mass spectrum, such as CunOn–1+ (n = 2–10), (Cu2O)n/2+ (n = 2–8 with n even), and CunO(n+1)/2+ (n = 3–11
with n odd). Some of the oxygen-deficient species
found in both mass spectra, at the 250 and 50 eV injection energies,
e.g., Cu2O+, Cu3O+, Cu4O2+, Cu5O2–3+, Cu6O3–4+, Cu7O4+, and Cu8O4–5+, were also observed in mass spectra of cluster ions
generated by laser ablation/ionization in the previous studies.14−17

As noted above, the cluster ions observed at 250 eV injection
energy
can, in general, be regarded as relatively stable species among copper
oxide cluster ions with respect to CID. As a result of CID processes,
oxygen-rich and oxygen-equivalent clusters have a tendency to prefer
to be dissociated to a variety of oxygen-deficient cluster series,
like (Cu2O)n/2+ (n even), CunO(n–1)/2+ (n odd), and CunO(n+1)/2+ (n odd), by the loss of oxygen atoms. These results
of CID have been also observed by Hirabayashi and Ichihashi.44 Moreover, the relative intensities of the small
stable species were found to be higher under high injection energy
because of the fragmentation of larger cluster ions.

4.2 2D Plot of Time-of-Flight (TOF) versus Arrival
Time and Arrival Time Distributions (ATDs)
A 2D-plot of TOF
vs arrival time for copper oxide cluster cations, CunOm+, at the ion-injection
energy of 50 eV is shown in Figure 2. In this plot, the horizontal axis is TOF, corresponding
to the mass number, and the vertical axis is the arrival time, which
is almost proportional to the CCS of each cluster ion. Due to the
weak ion intensity for larger cluster ions observed with the present
instrument, the 2D plot up to n = 8 is shown in the
figure. The arrival time of an ion has, in general, an increasing
tendency with the mass of the ion because of the increase of the number
of the constituent atoms. However, in this 2D spectrum, the arrival
time of some ions did not increase monotonically with the mass of
the cluster ion. In particular, the arrival times of Cu3O3+ and Cu4O3+ were shorter than those of their prior neighboring compositions,
Cu3O2+ and Cu4O2+, respectively. This feature indicates that the former
ions might have more compact geometries than the latter ions. In order
to deduce the experimental CCSs (Ωexp) of the cluster
ions, ATDs were first determined from this 2D plot. The peak values
of the arrival times were determined by fitting the ATDs with Gaussian
functions, as shown in Figure 3. In order to estimate reliable Ωexp values,
ATDs were analyzed for the data measured under the low injection energy
condition (Einj = 50 eV). This is because
the high Einj condition not only causes
CID, resulting in stable species, but also causes a longer deceleration
time for the cluster ion until the cluster reaches a constant drift
velocity (vd). As a result, the injected
ions tend to have shorter arrival times, and thus the high Einj condition results in underestimated CCSs.
The CCSs and structures of stable compositions such as CunOm+n:m ≈ 2:1 and the Cu3O+ ion,
which were observed at both 250 and 50 eV, are discussed in section 4.3.1. Some other
compositions which contained more oxygen, such as CunOn+ and CunOn–1+, were also selected for CCS calculations and structural determination,
discussed separately in section 4.3.2.

experimental plots (black circles).

4.3 Structural Assignment by Comparison of Experimental
and Theoretical Results
4.3.1 Structural Assignments
of the Most Abundant
Compositions, CunO∼n/2+
As shown in Figure 3a, where narrow ATD profiles
were fitted well by only one Gaussian function and changed gradually,
the most stable species, (Cu2O)∼n/2+ and Cu3O+, were suggested
to have one structural isomer or a family of structures with close
CCSs. However, the ATD of Cu7O4+ was
considerably broader and showed two separate peaks, and thus two Gaussian
functions were necessary for fitting the ATD of this cluster ion.
This observation suggested that two structural isomers with different
CCSs might coexist for Cu7O4+.

Calculated structures are shown in Figure 4 for cluster cations with the compositions
Cu2O+, Cu3O+, Cu4O2+, Cu5O3+, Cu6O3+, Cu7O4+, and Cu8O4+, which
were observed most abundantly in Figure 1. The experimental CCS, Ωexp, of each composition is also shown in the same figure, along with
the theoretical CCSs, Ωcalc, of the structures optimized
in the DFT calculations. Calculated isomers not presented in this
figure are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The experimental CCS was determined from the ATD with
an error of one standard deviation of the data for five independent
measurements.

Figure 4 Schematic representation and assigned structures for stable
cluster
cations of Cu2O+, Cu3O+, Cu4O2+, Cu5O3+, Cu6O3+, Cu7O4+, and Cu8O4+. Calculated CCSs (Ωcalc/Å2) and
relative energies from the most stable isomers (ΔE/eV, in parentheses) are also shown with experimental CCSs (Ωexp/Å2).

As shown in Figure 4 for Cu2O+, the most stable structure
with
a bent geometry has a theoretical CCS which is in good agreement with
the experimental CCS. This structure is almost the same as that reported
previously.20 In the Cu3O+ cluster, the most stable structure has a triangle geometry
in which three copper atoms are attached to the central oxygen atom.
This structure also can be made simply by adding one copper atom to
the bridging oxygen of the Cu2O+ geometry noted
above. This triangular planar structure is supported by comparison
of the CCS values between experiment (50.9 ± 2.5 Å2) and theory (50.4 Å2), and it is also supported
by the previous theoretical study.45 The
most stable structure of Cu4O2+ was
concluded to be a 2D branched one, as shown in Figure 4, which was already reported theoretically.20 Again, this structure of Cu4O2+ can be formed by aggregation of triangular Cu3O+ and a CuO unit: the CuO unit, attached from
the oxygen side with one of the Cu ends of the Cu3O+ cluster ion, gives a branched 2D geometry for the Cu4O2+ cluster cation. This structure was
assigned for Cu4O2+ also from the
CCS comparison: the Ωcalc value of the branched 2D
geometry (65.8 Å2) showed good agreement with the
Ωexp (64.4 ± 2.8 Å2) within
the standard deviation. For the Cu5O3+ cluster ion, the 2D closed-ring geometry, which is the most stable
structure in the calculations shown in Figure 4, was assigned as plausible since Ωcalc of this symmetrical closed-ring structure, 71.3 Å2, was close to Ωexp (69.0 ± 3.4 Å2). This structure can be constructed by adding one CuO unit
to the branched 2D Cu4O2+ geometry:
the oxygen atom was bonded to the bicoordinated bridged oxygen and
copper atoms bonded to the terminal oxygen of Cu4O2+, consequently forming the closed-ring 2D structure.
For the Cu6O3+ cluster ion, adding
a Cu unit to the aforementioned Cu5O3+ cluster geometry also yields a similar closed-ring 2D geometry.
This time, an extra Cu atom coordinated with the doubly bonded O atom
of the Cu5O3+ geometry. This structure
was also assigned to be the most probable because the theoretical
CCS of the structure, 78.3 Å2, was close to the CCS
obtained in the IMMS measurement, 77.3 ± 1.4 Å2. For Cu7O4+ and Cu8O4+, the systematic growth of structures noted above
for the small clusters appeared to be terminated on the basis of the
experimental results, as shown in Figure 3a. Additionally, two structural isomers were
assigned for Cu7O4+ in the ATD distribution:
one a symmetrical 2D geometry with a longer arrival time and the other
a compact 3D geometry with a shorter arrival time. The latter isomer
has an arrival time shorter than that for Cu6O3+. Also, for the Cu8O4+ cluster ion, a compact 3D structure was assigned by comparison between
the experimental and calculated CSSs. Relatively lower increments
were observed in the arrival time with increasing n at n = 7 and 8 than those in the composition with
smaller n (Figure 3a).

4.3.2 Structural Assignments
of the CunOn+ and
CunOn–1+ Series
In this section, the structural assignment
concentrated on the cluster ions containing more oxygen atoms, which
were mostly observed at the 50 eV injection energy condition. As mentioned
in section 4.2, ATDs
were obtained for the CunOn+ and CunOn–1+ series, as shown in Figure 3b,c. The ATDs of
the CunOn+ (n = 2–8) cluster cations shown in Figure 3b had narrow profiles
and were fitted well with one Gaussian function, which indicated the
presence of one structural isomer or a family of multiple structures
with close CCSs. The ATDs of this series did not changed smoothly
with cluster size but changed rather unevenly. Specifically, the arrival
time of Cu3O3+ is almost the same
as that of Cu2O2+. The increments
in the arrival times between Cu5O5+ and Cu6O6+ and those between Cu7O7+ and Cu8O8+ were also smaller than in the other cases. These differences
in trends in consecutive ATD plots might reflect details about the
growth of the geometrical structures.

In the oxygen-deficient
CunOn–1+ series (n = 2–8) shown in Figure 3c, the ATD plots
were also all fitted by only one Gaussian function, except for Cu5O4+. Similar to the Cu7O4+ cluster ion mentioned in section 4.3.1, the Cu5O4+ cluster ion was also predicted to have two structural
isomers with different CCSs. Meanwhile, stepwise growth of ATDs at
some cluster size was observed for the whole CunOn–1+ series.
For example, the arrival times of Cu3O2+ and Cu4O3+ were almost the
same. Similarly, the ATDs obtained for the slower components of Cu5O4+ and Cu6O5+, and also for Cu7O6+ and
Cu8O7+, were almost the same. These
results indicate stepwise structural growth at these cluster sizes,
and, importantly, they imply that the later species might contain
comparatively compact structures.

Structural candidates along
with their experimental CCSs (Ωexp/Å2), theoretical CCSs (Ωcalc/Å2),
and relative energies (ΔE/eV) for CunOn+ and
CunOn–1+ are summarized in Figures 5 and 6. These structural
candidates were classified into best-fitted structures and other candidate
structures. The structures with theoretical CCSs close to the experimental
CCSs were considered as best-fitted structures.

Figure 5 Optimized structural
candidates for CunOn+ for n = 2–8, calculated
at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. The corresponding
theoretical CCSs (Ωcalc/Å2) and relative
energies for the most stable structure (ΔE/eV,
in parentheses) are shown below the structures. For comparison, the
experimental CCSs (Ωexp/Å2) are also
labeled along with standard deviations. The structures with the theoretical
CCS closest to the experimental value are shown as the best-fitted
structures. Other possible structures are indicated by underlines
from the comparison between Ωexp and Ωcalc.

Figure 6 Optimized structural
candidates for CunOn–1+ for n = 2–8,
calculated at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. The corresponding
theoretical CCSs (Ωcalc/Å2) and relative
energies for the most stable structure (ΔE/eV,
in parentheses) are shown below the structures. For comparison, the
experimental CCSs (Ωexp/Å2) are also
labeled along with standard deviations. The structures with the theoretical
CCS closest to the experimental value are shown as the best-fitted
structures. Other possible structures are indicated by underlines
from the comparison between Ωexp and Ωcalc.

As shown in Figure 5, the most stable
(ΔE = 0) structures of n =
2–8 were either 2D (n = 2, 3,
and 6) or 3D structures (n = 4, 5, 7, and 8) for
CunOn+ cations. This stability trend is somewhat different from
the IMS results of the other oxide cluster ions of 3d transition metals,
Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn, reported previously by the authors’ group.28−31 For example, stable structures of MnOn+, with M = Fe, Ni, Co,
and Zn, were predicted as either ring or cubic for n = 4 and 5. However, the most stable structures for Cu4O4+ and Cu5O5+ were found to be 3D structures containing an O–O bond, which
were also previously obtained theoretically by another group.22 For Cu2O2+,
Ωcalc of the 2D zigzag planar isomer (49.9 Å2) was found to be in good agreement with Ωexp (50.2 ± 2.5 Å2). As for Cu3O3+, Ωcalc of the best-fitted structure
(56.3 Å2) or the most stable cyclic structure (56.9
Å2) did not agree well with Ωexp (51.4
± 2.3 Å2) at the present calculation level. In
fact, the 2D plot of arrival time vs TOF, shown in Figure 2, revealed that the arrival
time for Cu3O3+ fell abruptly compared
with that of the prior-size neighbor. Therefore, a more compact structure
was suggested for the Cu3O3+ cluster.
This tendency was also observed in Figure 7, where the theoretical CCS, Ωcalc, of this structure shows the same trend with the experimental
CCS, Ωexp.

Figure 7 Experimental collision cross sections obtained
by ion mobility
experiments, Ωexp, for copper oxide cluster cations,
CunOm+, plotted as red circles. Theoretical cross sections, Ωcalc, for the assigned structures are plotted as black triangles.

For Cu4O4+, Ωcalc of the O–O bonded nonplanar
isomer (65.3 Å2), which was the most stable, was a
little larger than Ωexp (61.6 ± 2.6 Å2), while Ωcalc of the 3D box structure (63.1
Å2) was
closer to Ωexp. Therefore, the 3D compact structure
was suggested for Cu4O4+. For (CuO)5–8+, we obtained 3D-type isomers which have
comparable Ωcalc and Ωexp values,
although they were less stable, especially for Cu5O5+ and Cu6O6+.
For Cu5O5+, three candidate structures
(CCSs underlined) shown in Figure 5 have 3D structures which grow from or slightly distorted
from 2D isomers. For Cu6O6+, Ωcalc of the 3D compact structure (77.0 Å2)
was in good agreement with Ωexp (77.3 ± 3.7
Å2), whereas the most stable isomer has a 2D sheet-like
structure. Both the 2D sheet (90.6 Å2) and the 3D
compact (86.0 Å2) isomers were assigned for the structures
of Cu7O7+ because they have CCSs
comparable with Ωexp (87.8 ± 4.2 Å2). A tendency similar to that seen with the Cu6O6+ ion was observed for n = 8: the 3D isomers were assigned as the most probable structures
for the Cu8O8+ cluster ion. The experimental
CCS difference from n = 4 (Ωexp =
61.6 Å2) to n = 5 (Ωexp = 72.2 Å2) is 10.6 Å2, while the
CCS difference from n = 5 (Ωexp =
72.2 Å2) to n = 6 (Ωexp = 77.3 Å2) is only 5.1 Å2, which
is almost half that of the prior compositions. The same phenomenon
was noted for n = 6 (Ωexp = 77.3
Å2) to n = 7 (Ωexp = 87.8 Å2), and from n = 7 (Ωexp = 87.8 Å2) to n = 8 (Ωexp = 92.1 Å2), where CCS differences are 10.5
and 4.3 Å2, respectively. This observation of large
CCS differences from n = 4 to 5 and from n = 6 to 7 was explained by the existence of 2D structures
at n = 5 and 7 in addition to 3D isomers.

From
the structural candidates of CunOn–1+ series shown
in Figure 6, 2D structures
were found to be the most stable (ΔE = 0) structures
for n = 2–5 and 3D structures for n = 6–8 at the present calculation level. The structure
of Cu2O+ was assigned in section 4.3.1. For Cu3O2+, two types of 2D structures, the most stable
zigzag and another bent isomer with slightly higher energy, were assigned
in this study: the Ωcalc values of the zigzag (58.3
Å2) and 2D bent (58.4 Å2) isomers
were in good agreement with Ωexp (58.3 ± 2.7
Å2). Because the experimental CCSs for
Cu3O2+ and Cu4O3+ were found to be very close, as it was suggested from
ATDs in Figure 3c,
the Cu4O3+ ion should have a structure
different from the 2D structure, like Cu3O2+. Although a 2D cyclic isomer was found to be the most stable
in the present calculation, its theoretical CCS (65.3 Å2) was much larger than the experimental value (60.1 ± 2.5 Å2). Instead, two 3D compact structures for the Cu4O3+ cluster ion were assigned as probable structures,
because they have theoretical Ωcalc (60.9 and 60.1
Å2) similar to Ωexp, and also because
they have very little energy differences (ΔE = 0.15 and 0.19 eV, respectively) from the most stable structure.
As observed in Figure 3c, two Gaussian functions were fitted to the ATD of the Cu5O4+ cluster ion, indicating the coexistence
of at least two different structural isomers. From the calculations,
Ωcalc of the 3D compact isomer (64.9 Å2) of Cu5O4+ cluster ion was found
to be the closest to the smaller Ωexp (63.0 ±
2.6 Å2), whereas Ωcalc of a 2D sheet
structure (69.1 Å2; ΔE = 0
eV) was in agreement with larger Ωexp (71.0 ±
2.6 Å2). Therefore, it can be concluded that the 2D
sheet and the 3D compact structures coexist in Cu5O4+. Moreover, the observation that the CCSs of the
larger isomer of Cu5O4+ and Cu6O5+ are almost equal indicates that
the Cu6O5+ ion should have more compact
structures than the 2D sheet isomer of Cu5O4+. Ωcalc of the most stable 3D isomer
(75.6 Å2; ΔE = 0 eV) of Cu6O5+ was found to be a little larger
than Ωexp (71.5 ± 3.1 Å2), and
Ωcalc for the other 3D compact structure (74.2 Å2; ΔE = 0.4 eV) was in good agreement
with Ωexp within the standard deviation limit. Therefore,
the latter 3D compact structure was assigned as the most plausible
structure for Cu6O5+. For the Cu7O6+ ion, two 3D isomers (Ωcalc = 84.7 Å2; ΔE =
0 eV, and Ωcalc = 83.1 Å2; ΔE = 0.5 eV) and a sheet-type 2D isomer (Ωcalc = 87.9 Å2; ΔE = 0.6 eV) were
found to have CCSs comparable with Ωexp (85.7 ±
4.3 Å2). Hence, these 2D sheet and 3D compact structures
were assigned as structural candidates for the Cu7O6+ cluster cation. Similar to the previous pair
of Cu5O4+ and Cu6O5+, the observed ATD band position of Cu8O7+ was almost same as that of its preceding
neighbor, Cu7O6+, as shown in Figure 3c. The Ωcalc values of a few 3D isomers were comparable but a little
larger than Ωexp for Cu8O7+. Therefore, such 3D structures were tentatively assigned
as structural candidates for Cu8O7+.

5 Conclusion
Stable
compositions and structures of copper oxide cluster cations
were assigned in this study on the basis of a comparison of collision
cross sections (CCSs) obtained in experiments and in theory. This
target was achieved experimentally with ion mobility mass spectrometry
and theoretically with theoretical calculations. In this study, mass
spectra of copper oxide cluster cations (CunOm+) were measured at two
different injection energies of 250 and 50 eV into the ion-drift cell
for ion mobility measurement. Stable compositions were obtained with
respect to collision-induced dissociation just inside of the ion-drift
cell from this experiment, and they were assigned as CunOm+, n:m ≈ 2:1. In the present study, it was mainly these
stable compositions that were analyzed for structural assignment.
Other important cluster series, CunOn+ and CunOn–1+ (n = 2–8), which were observed only at 50 eV injection energy
condition, were also analyzed to assign the structures. Arrival time
distributions (ATDs) of these ion series were obtained from the 2D
plot of copper oxide cluster cations. Experimental CCSs were deduced
from ATDs. Theoretical CCSs were calculated for stable structures
optimized by quantum chemical calculations. The structures of copper
oxide cluster cations were determined by comparison between experimental
and theoretical CCSs. Systematic structural growth was observed for
the stable compositions of CunOm+, n:m ≈
2:1, up to n = 6, and then complex shapes began to
appear for n = 7 and 8. Both 2D and 3D compact structures
were assigned for CunOn+. In the case of the CunOn–1+ cluster ion,
stepwise structural growth was observed from 2D to 3D for sizes Cu3O2+ to Cu4O3+, Cu5O4+ to Cu6O5+, and Cu7O6+ to Cu8O7+. Additionally, 2D sheet
and 3D compact isomers were found to coexist in the Cu5O4+ and Cu7O4+ cluster ions.
