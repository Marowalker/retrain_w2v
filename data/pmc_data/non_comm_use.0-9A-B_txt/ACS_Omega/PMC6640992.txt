Two novel organic donor–acceptor−π–acceptor
sensitizers, W7 and W8, have been applied in efficient solid-state
dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs). Using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)
9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) as hole-transport material
(HTM), an excellent power conversion efficiency of 6.9% was recorded
for W7, together with an excellent photocurrent of 10.51 mA cm–2 and a high open-circuit voltage of 880 mV under standard
AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm–2). The solid-state
solar cells based on W8 showed an efficiency of 5.2%, with a good
photocurrent of 9.55 mA cm–2 and an open-circuit
voltage of 870 mV. Compared to that of the well-known WS2 sensitizer,
the results show that the performance of the ssDSSC devices can be
significantly improved by introducing triphenylamine moiety into their
structure. In addition, results of photoinduced absorption spectroscopy
show efficient dye regeneration for W7- and W8-based devices. A higher
hole conductivity of the W7/HTM and W8/HTM layers compared to that
of the WS2/HTM layer was observed, indicating an efficient charge
transfer at the interfaces. The results obtained offer insights into
the design of reliable and highly efficient ssDSSCs for large-scale
applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely investigated
because of their low cost, environment friendliness, and high power
conversion efficiency (PCE), as reported by O’Regan and Grätzel
in 1991.1 Nowadays, over 14% of DSSC efficiency
has been achieved on the basis of different liquid electrolytes.2−4 The device structures of DSSCs are based on various functional components,
such as the light absorber, the charge-transport medium, and the electrodes.5,6 Among them, the light absorber (known as the sensitizer) has been
the most crucial component for the design of highly efficient DSSCs.
In the early stage, ruthenium-based dyes were widely investigated.7,8 However, because of the high cost of Ru and the potentially environmentally
harmful impact, metal-free sensitizers have attracted an increasing
attention. In 2006, the pioneering work by the Sun and Hagfeldt group
highlighted the organic D5 dye (known as a D−π–A-type
dye) in DSSCs.9 This type of molecule consists
of three main components: a donor part (D), a conjugated linker (π),
and an acceptor group (A).10 Subsequently,
a large number of organic dyes have been synthesized and applied in
DSSCs.11−13

Because of potential leakage and corrosion
problems of liquid DSSC
electrolytes, recent research has instead focused on solid-state DSSC
electrolytes (ssDSSCs).14 In addition,
a lower driving force is required for effective dye regeneration in
ssDSSCs in contrast to the liquid congener, which opens for higher
open-circuit voltages.15 Until now, the
best ssDSSCs have displayed just over 7% conversion efficiencies,16−18 utilizing low-cost organic dyes. In particular, Zhang and co-workers
synthesized conducting polymers through a photoelectrochemical polymerization
(PEP) method as hole-transport material (HTM), rendering devices with,
for ssDSSCs, high efficiencies of up to 7.1%.17,19,20 Xu and co-workers synthesized a series of
organic semiconductors for highly efficient ssDSSCs (efficiency of
up to 7.7%).18,21−24Also, it is reported that the
modification of the p-type dopant for the HTMs used can successfully
improve the performance of the devices through enhancement of the
HTM conductivities and charge mobilities.1825

In spite of the extensive use
of D−π–A dyes
in ssDSSCs, there is still scope for improvement in new generations
of efficient and stable organic dyes. Recently, the D–A−π–A-type
dyes have drawn much attention in the academic field. The use of an
auxiliary electron-withdrawing unit incorporated into the conjugated
linker, the intramolecular electron transfer, is expected to be facilitated
from the donor to the acceptor. In addition, the additional electron-deficient
unit may modulate the absorption ability and minimize the typical
blue shift upon dye anchoring on the TiO2 surface. Recently,
the Tian group has synthesized a series of D–A−π–A
dyes applied in liquid-type DSSCs.12,26,27 Their studies indicated that the WS51 dye combined
excellent light-harvesting ability and rapid dye-adsorption capability
via rational molecular engineering.12 Cui
et al. showed that the long alkyl group in the benzotriazole moiety
significantly enhances the open-circuit photovoltage.28 Recently, Kang et al. have studied the correlation between
the structures of D–A−π–A dyes and the
photovoltaic performance of solar cells.29 In addition, Pei et al. investigated the effects of co-sensitization
of D–A−π–A dyes and pushed the efficiencies
to over 10% in liquid-electrolyte-based devices.30 However, studies on the application of D–A−π–A
dyes in ssDSSCs are quite few.

In the present study, two different
D–A−π–A
dyes have been applied in ssDSSCs. The WS2 dye was also investigated
as a reference. The structures of the materials studied here are presented
in Figure 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis
Absorption and Electrochemistry
The schemes of the ssDSSC
device configuration and energy alignment
are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. Initially, the sensitizers are excited via illumination,
followed by the injection of photogenerated electrons into the conduction
band of TiO2. Then, the remaining holes are transferred
by the hole conductors to the counter electrode to complete the internal
circuit. From an energetic point of view, the HOMO level of the sensitizers
should be more positive than that of the hole conductors (on the NHE
scale) to provide a sufficient driving force for the necessary charge-transfer
process of dye reduction. Figure 2b shows the energy levels of the sensitizers as determined
by electrochemistry. More details can be found in the Supporting Information. All electrochemical data
are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO levels of W7 and W8 are 0.96 and 0.92 V versus the NHE,
respectively, which are higher than the HOMO level of Spiro-OMeTAD
(0.64 V) for both. Therefore, the charge transfer between the dyes
and the hole conductors is energetically favorable for both W7 and
W8 sensitizers.

levels

a The HOMO was obtained
from the redox
potentials calibrated vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by the
addition of ferrocene (E(Fc/Fc+) = 630 mV vs NHE) as reference.

b E0–0 was determined by the intersection
between the absorption and emission
spectra.

c ELUMO = EHOMO + E0−0 was estimated from cyclic voltammetry results.

The light-absorption properties
of W7 and W8 are studied. Figure 3a shows the light
absorption and emission of W7 and W8 in solution. The related data
are summarized in Table 1. The absorption peaks for both dyes are similar and located at 534
nm (W7) and 532 nm (W8), respectively. The thiophene unit as the linker
part would increase the extinction coefficient similarly to the furan
unit. The emission peaks are found at 720 and 716 nm for W7 and W8,
respectively. Figure 3b shows the absorption spectra of W7 and W8 adsorbed onto TiO2 substrates. In the absence of additives, the absorption peaks
are slightly blue-shifted compared to those in Figure 3a. This blue shift is most likely caused
by the deprotonation of the terminal carboxylic group upon adsorption.
In the presence of additives, the absorption peaks are less blue-shifted
for both W7 and W8 sensitizers. Most likely, this effect can be attributed
to the polarizing effect of the Li-ion salts.31,32

film with and without additives (LiTFSI).

2.2 Theoretical Calculations
Quantum
chemistry calculations have been performed to get insights into the
electron structure of the sensitizers. The frontier orbitals of W7
and W8 are shown in Figure 4. The dye molecules typically exhibit push–pull electron
effects, where the HOMO and the LUMO are mainly composed of donor
and acceptor moieties, respectively. For both W7 and W8, we can note
that the HOMO and HOMO – 1 are mainly localized on the triphenylamine
(TPA) units (donors), and the LUMO and LUMO + 1 are to a large extent
localized on the benzotriazole and carboxylic acid units (acceptors).
Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations have
also been performed to give insights into the composition of the excited
states of the sensitizers. These results are summarized in the Supporting Information. The HOMO → LUMO
transition dominates the contribution to the maximum absorption band
(Table S1). This is reasonable because
there is a large spatial overlap between the HOMO and LUMO in both
W7 and W8 molecules. The HOMO → LUMO transition also shows
a mixing between long-range charge transfer and local excitation,
and the resultant oscillator strength for the lowest excited state
is significant.

0.02).

2.3 Characterization
of ssDSSC Devices
The J–V curves of the ssDSSCs
based on different sensitizers studied at 1 sun illumination under
standard global AM 1.5G conditions are shown in Figure 5, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters
summarized in Table 2. Also, the statistical data are included in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 5a, by employing Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs, devices
based on WS2 yield an open-circuit potential (Voc) of 672 mV and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 7.04 mA/cm2, yielding PCEs of 2.3%.
The efficiency was limited by the low photocurrent. On the other hand,
the devices based on the W7 dye show Voc, Jsc, and FF of 880 mV, 10.51 mA cm–2, and 0.74, respectively, yielding a higher PCE of
6.9%. Similarly, the ssDSSCs based on W8 dyes yielded an efficiency
of 5.2%, with a photocurrent of 9.55 mA cm–2, a
photovoltage of 870 mV, and a fill factor of 0.62. From the performance
of the devices mentioned above based on different sensitizers, the
TPA units seem to offer improved Voc and Jsc, resulting the higher efficiencies
recorded. In addition, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) data are in good agreement with the results shown in Table 2. In general, the
light-absorption range of three different dyes is quite similar. However,
the W7 dye shows the highest maximum monochromatic efficiency of 70%
at 560 nm. The W8-based devices show a maximum monochromatic efficiency
of 60% at 550 nm, compared to that of 40% (550 nm) for the devices
based on the WS2 dye.

2.4 Electron
Lifetimes
To study the recombination
process in ssDSSCs, electron lifetime measurements were performed
(Figure 6). The W7-based
devices show the longest electron lifetimes, whereas the WS2-based
devices showed the shortest lifetimes. These differences could be
traced to the different donor groups in the sensitizers studied. The
steric properties and size of the donor moiety in the sensitizers
may have a serious impact on the recombination process at the photoelectrode
interface in the ssDSSC devices. The introduction of a bulky donor
into the framework of the sensitizers may significantly suppress the
recombination of the electron–hole pairs and thus push the
pseudo-Fermi level of the TiO2 substrate up, resulting
in a higher Voc.10,33,34

voltages for
different HTM-based ssDSSCs.

2.5 Photoinduced Absorption (PIA) and Conductivity
PIA measurements were performed to investigate the photoelectrode
interface charge transfer in ssDSSCs. The general process can be described
as follows: the sensitizers will be excited by incident light and
inject energy-rich electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 film, leaving holes in the oxidized sensitizers. The light
absorption of the oxidized sensitizers can be studied using PIA measurements.
In the presence of HTMs, the photogenerated holes can be transferred
into the HTMs, and, if the transfer is efficient, the light absorption
of the oxidized dye molecules will be reduced. In Figure 7a, in the absence of an HTM
layer, the positive peaks between 700 and 900 nm can be assigned to
the oxidized WS2 dye. After deposition of the HTM layer on top of
the WS2 dye layer, we can note that the absorption from the oxidized
WS2 is slightly reduced, indicating a poor regeneration process mediated
by the HTM layer. On the contrary, the W7 and W8 dyes appear to be
efficiently regenerated. In Figure 7b,c, referring to dyes W7 and W8, respectively, the
presence of an HTM layer in contrast indicates an efficient charge
transfer from the HTM to the dyes. These results may highlight the
reason for the excellent photocurrents of W7- and W8-based devices
noted in Figure 3.

Figure 7 PIA spectra
of the devices based on different sensitizers with
and without HTM.

Many factors may affect
the dye regeneration process. The steric
effect of the donor part in the dye molecules could be vital. The
aggregation tendency may be reduced by large bulky donor parts, resulting
in a better interaction between the sensitizers and the HTM. Indoline-based
donor parts may enhance the aggregation of the dye molecules and result
in lower photocurrents.12,26

Previous studies
have shown that the dye layer can act as a hole-transport
layer in ssDSSCs.35,36 Therefore, the hole-hopping process
between the dye molecules most likely affects the overall performance.
From the calculation results, the reorganization energy of WS2 is
noted to be lower than that for the other two materials, which would
indicate better transport abilities (Table 3). The results from the conductivity measurements
also support this hypothesis. From the data in Table 3, the hole conductivities of WS2, W7, and
W8 are 2.91 × 10–7, 1.01 × 10–7, and 1.22 × 10–7 S cm–1, respectively. However, after the deposition of the HTM layer on
the top of the dye layer, the WS2/HTM film shows the lowest conductivity.
This may indicate that the charge transfer at the interface of the
WS2/HTM system can be inefficient, which is consistent with the results
of the PIA measurement. Such low conductivity is expected to increase
the charge-transport resistance in the ssDSSC devices and thus lower
the FF and Jsc.

2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
To investigate the morphology of the inner structure of ssDSSCs on
the basis of different dyes, SEM has been employed. Figure 8b,c shows no obvious presence
of a capping layer of HTM, indicating full penetration of the HTM
into the TiO2/dye layers. However, in the case of WS2-based
ssDSSCs, a thin HTM layer can be distinguished under the Ag electrode
layer. The inefficient pore filling could limit the charge transfer
between the dye molecules and the hole conductor, thus suppressing
the overall performance of the devices.

section of ssDSSCs based on different
sensitizers: (a) WS2-based devices, (b) W7-based devices, and (c)
W8-based devices.

2.7 Aging
Stability Study
The stability
of solid-state photovoltaic devices is crucial for any future real-life
application. Aging tests under ambient but dark conditions of the
ssDSSCs based on different D–A−π–A dyes
were therefore performed. All devices were stored in the dark at room
temperature and in a relative humidity of around 25%. The resulting
photovoltaic data are summarized in Figure 9. In general, all of the devices remain stable
for 170 h. The short-circuit current of the WS2-based devices starts
to drop after around 50 h of aging. The W7-based solar cells show
better stability with only a small decline in the performance (about
6%) during the test period. After 170 h of aging, the W8-based solar
cells retain around 5% overall conversion efficiency, which is quite
close to its original performance.

and W8.

3 Conclusions
Two novel organic dyes of D–A−π–A configuration,
W7 and W8, have been studied for use in efficient ssDSSCs. The W7-based
devices yielded an excellent PCE of 6.9%, with a photocurrent of 10.51
mA cm–2, a high open-circuit voltage of 880 mV,
and a good fill factor of 0.74 under standard AM 1.5 G illumination
(100 mW cm–2). The W8-based solid-state solar cells
showed an efficiency of 5.2%, with a fill factor of 0.62, a photocurrent
of 9.55 mA cm–2, and an open-circuit voltage of
870 mV. Compared to that of the well-known WS2 sensitizer, the results
show that the performance of the ssDSSC devices can be significantly
improved by introducing an extra TPA moiety into the molecular structure
of the dye. In addition, results of PIA spectroscopy show efficient
dye regeneration for both W7- and W8-based devices. The conductivity
measurements show a higher hole conductivity for the W7/HTM and W8/HTM
layers compared to that of the WS2/HTM layer, indicating an efficient
charge transfer at the interfaces of the two former systems. The results
obtained offer insights into the design of reliable and highly efficient
ssDSSCs with a potential for large-scale applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Sensitizers
Most of
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. In particular, dye WS2
was obtained from Dyenamo AB. Details on the route of synthesis could
be found in the Supporting Information. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded for the dyes.

4.2 Electrochemical Setup and UV–Vis Absorption
Measurement
We used a Lambda 750 UV–Vis spectrophotometer
for the UV–vis measurement. The electrolytic solution for the
electrochemical measurement is 0.1 M LiTFSI in dichloromethane. A
stainless steel plate was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl/3
M NaCl was used as the reference electrode.

4.3 Device
Fabrication and Characterization
The detailed process of
fabrication can be found in our previous
paper.34 Briefly, fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrates were dipped into a Zn-HCl solution
(2M) via the etch process. After this initial step, the substrates
were cleaned using deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in an ultrasonic
bath. The compact layer used the spray pyrolysis deposition technique.
Afterward, a thin TiO2 layer was deposited onto the compact
layer using the screen-printing method. After sintering on a hot plate
at 500 °C for 30 min, the substrate was post-treated in a solution
of 0.2 M aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. Then,
the substrates were rinsed with deionized water and ethanol and subsequently
annealed on a hot plate at 500 °C for another 30 min. The dye
bath solution in this study contained 0.2 mM of the dye in a mixed
solvent of tert-butanol and acetonitrile (1:1). The
time for dye bath is 5 h. After that, we used ethanol to rinse the
electrodes. The surfaces of the dried substrates were then covered
by a solution of the HTM, also containing additives, and spin-coated
for 30 s at 2000 rpm. Finally, a 200 nm thick Ag layer was made as
the counter electrode using the process of thermal evaporation in
a vacuum chamber (Leica EM MED020).

The current–voltage
curves of the ssDSSCs were recorded under 100 mW cm–2 (AM 1.5) radiation using a Keithley Model 2400 SourceMeter.34 The light source was also calibrated before
use. We used a black mask with an aperture area of 0.126 cm2 for the measurements. The electron lifetime data and the IPCE spectra
were recorded according to our previous paper.34

4.4 PIA Spectroscopy
The PIA spectra
were recorded on a specially constructed setup.37 A 20 W tungsten–halogen lamp was used to generate
the white probe light. A square-wave modulated (on/off) blue light
source (Thorlabs DC3100 LED system, 470 nm) was used for excitation.
A light intensity of 6.1 mW cm–2 and a modulation
frequency of 9.33 Hz were used for the blue LED light excitation.

4.5 Quantum Chemistry Calculations
The
quantum calculations based on DFT were performed to generate the relaxed
geometries of the molecules under study. Optimization and single-point
energy calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional and
6-311G* basis sets for all atoms. All reported calculations were carried
out using Gaussian 09.38 The absorption
spectra and excitation energies were estimated by TD-DFT using the
MPW1K functional.39 The solvent effects
were taken into consideration using the polarizable continuum model.
The equation for calculating the internal reorganization energy (λ)
was based on the Nelson four-point method:40 λ = E+* – E+ + E* – E, where E+* is the energy of the neutral molecule in
the cation symmetry, E+ is the total energy
of the optimized cationic molecule, E* is the total
energy of the cationic molecule in the neutral symmetry, and E is the total energy of the optimized neutral molecule.
