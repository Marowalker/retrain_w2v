Oxygenated
fuel is a promising alternative fuel for engines because
of the advantage of low emission. In this work, a general model based
on back-propagation neural networks was developed for estimating the
viscosities of different kinds of oxygenated fuels including esters,
alcohols, and ethers, whose input variables are pressure, temperature,
critical pressure, critical temperature, molar mass, and acentric
factor. The viscosity data of 31 oxygenated fuels (1574 points) at
temperatures ranging from 243.15 to 413.15 K and at pressures ranging
from 0.1 to 200 MPa were collected to train and test the back-propagation
neural network model. The comparison result shows that the predictions
of the proposed back-propagation neural network model agree well with
the experimental viscosity data of all studied oxygenated fuels using
the general parameters (weight and bias). The average absolute relative
deviations for training data, validation data, and testing data are
1.19%, 1.27%, and 1.30%, respectively.

1 Introduction
Reducing
global greenhouse gas emissions is
an issue concerned to the world, and a number of research studies
have been performed on this issue.1−7 Oxygenated fuels including biodiesels, alcohols, ethers, etc., which
have the advantages of lower soot and particle emissions compared
with fossil fuels, are considered as environment-friendly fuels for
engine.8−12 The viscosity data of oxygenated fuels are extremely important in
the process of transportation, storage, and usage.13 There are plenty of experimental viscosity data for oxygenated
fuels from atmospheric pressure to hundreds of megapascals reported
in the literature.14−20 However, experimental data are always discrete points and cannot
really meet the actual demand. The accurate viscosity model established
on the basis of experimental data is more meaningful to provide sufficient
viscosity data of oxygenated fuels. Many viscosity models
have been developed for oxygenated fuels such as esters, alcohols,
and ethers, but only few examples are given here. Allal et al.21 proposed a viscosity model-based free volume
(FV) theory for alcohols. Assael et al.22 proposed a hard-sphere model for estimation of the viscosities of n-alcohols. Yuan et al.23 used
the Vogel equation to correlate the viscosities of fatty acid methyl
esters at atmospheric pressure. Ceriani et al.24 proposed a viscosity model based on the group contribution
method for the viscosities of methyl and ethyl esters and alcohols.
Habibi et al.25 developed a viscosity model
for alcohols combining CPA equation and friction theory. Ivanciuc
et al.26 proposed a quantitative structure–property
relationship model for the liquid viscosities of esters, alcohols,
ethers, etc. Our group proposed a viscosity model based on Eyring’s
absolute rate theory (EART) named HLZ model in previous work27 and applied it to estimate the viscosities of
esters, alcohols, and ethers.28 Although
these models have high accuracy, they need one set of parameters obtained
by fitting to the experimental data for each oxygenated fuel.

In recent years, artificial neural network (ANN) which is a popular
way to solve the nonlinear mapping problem has been used to predict
various physical properties of a fluid, such as density, surface tension,
and viscosity, and achieved a great success.29−31 Compared with
traditional models, the parameters of the ANN model are universal
for different substances, so the ANN model has much better predictive
ability. Some ANN models have been developed for predicting the viscosities
of esters in the literature. For example, Hosseini et al.32 proposed an ANN model to predict the viscosities
of eight fatty acid esters and two biodiesels at a pressure up to
140 MPa using four input variables (pressure, pseudo-critical density,
temperature, and molecular weight). However, for other kinds of oxygenated
fuels such as alcohols and ethers, there are few ANN models applicable
to predict their viscosities.

Therefore, in this work, we aim
to develop a general model based
on ANN for estimating the viscosities of different kinds of oxygenated
fuels including esters, alcohols, and ethers at a pressure up to 200
MPa. Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was chosen because it
is the most widely used ANN because of its stability and reliability.33

2 Computational Method
2.1 Model Description
BPNN, which is
a kind of feed forward neural network,34 has three parts (input layer, hidden layer, and output layer) and
five elements (input variable, weight, summation function, activation
function, and output variable). Each layer has several neurons, and
the values of neurons will be calculated using the values of neurons
in the previous layer via summation function and activation function.
BPNN usually has one or two hidden layers for data fitting. BPNN with
two hidden layers has better accuracy and better capacity to solve
the nonlinear problem compared with BPNN with one hidden layer.35 Therefore, our work chose the BPNN with two
hidden layers. Figure 1 is the schematic diagram of BPNN with two hidden layers. Pressure
and temperature are the parameters deciding the viscosity of the compound,
while critical pressure, critical temperature, molar mass, and acentric
factor are characterization parameters of the compound. Therefore,
six factors such as pressure (p, Pa), temperature
(T, K), critical pressure (pc, Pa), critical temperature (Tc, K), mole mass (MW, g·mol–1), and acentric factor (ω) were chosen as the input variables.
Critical pressure (pc, Pa), critical temperature
(Tc, K), mole mass (MW, g·mol–1), and acentric factor
(ω) were chosen because these parameters are constant for one
compound, which are usually used to characterize the compound and
as the input parameters for predicting the viscosity.36 The output variable is viscosity (η, μPa·s).
The number of neurons in the input layer depends on the input variables
and that in the output layer depends on the output variables. Therefore,
the hidden layer is the only adjustable part.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
BPNN.

The procedure for finding the
best BPNN structure is as follows:
first, collecting data and dividing them into training data, verification
data, and testing data; second, training the BPNN model using training
data and verification data to determine the BPNN structure, the summation
function, and the activation function; and third, testing the predictive
ability of the BPNN model using testing data.

Considering the
difference of input data and output data in dimension,
these data were dealt with eq 1. 1  where X is the original value
of the variable, x is the normalized value, and Xmin and Xmax are
the minimum value and maximum value of the variable, respectively.

In BPNN, the summation function is used to connect neurons of two
adjacent layers. The value of ith neuron in the (k + 1)th layer zik+1 can be calculated by a summation
function as follows 2  where wijk+1 is the weight of the jth neuron in the (k + 1)th layer, bjk+1 is the bias of the jth neuron in the (k + 1)th layer, and ajk is the output of the jth neuron in the kth layer, which is calculated
by the activation function of zjk. In this work, three commonly
used activation functions which are pureline function, log sigmoid
function, and tan-sigmoid function were tested. Comparison result
shows that the log sigmoid function has better performance than the
activation function. The log sigmoid function is expressed as 3  where ajk+1 is the output of the jth neuron in the (k + 1)th layer.

2.2 Data Collection
The viscosity data
of 31 oxygenated fuels (1574 points) at temperatures ranging from
243.15 to 413.15 K and at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 200 MPa are
collected from the literature14−19,37−50 and listed in Table 1. The information of the chemicals provided in the literature is
shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The physical properties of the 31 oxygenated fuels are listed
in Table 2.36 Seventy percent of the total data (1102 points)
were used for training the BPNN model, 15% of the total data (236
points) were used for validation, and 15% of the total data (236 points)
were used for testing data. All of the data were divided randomly.

3 Results and Discussion
Less neurons in the hidden layer will lead to underfitting and
large error, while more neurons in the hidden layer will result in
overfitting and time-consuming error. After investigation of the previous
work,32 the mean-square error (MSE) was
chosen as the optimization objective during the training to get the
best BPNN structure. The MSE is expressed as 4  where yiref and yical are the experimental value and calculated
values of the output variable, respectively.

The training result
shows that the BPNN should have two hidden
layers and the neuron numbers in them are 6 and 12, respectively. Tables 3–5 report the weight and bias of
the input layer, the first hidden layer, and the second layer, respectively.
To explain the optimization procedure, an example is given in Figure 2, which shows the
MSE of the viscosity data of 31 oxygenated fuels with the neuron number
of the second hidden layer changing from 4 to 19 while 6 neurons in
the first hidden layer. The result shows that when there are 12 neurons
in the second hidden layer (MSE = 0.01454), the BPNN model has the
best performance for estimating the viscosities of oxygenated fuels.
Therefore, we chose 12 as the neuron number in the second hidden layer.

the BPNN model at different neuron numbers in the second
hidden layer.

The performance of
the obtained BPNN model was also evaluated by
several other factors which are average absolute relative deviation
(AARD) and maximum absolute relative deviation (MARD) defined by eqs 5 and 6, respectively. 5   6  where
ηexp and ηcal are the experimental
and calculated values from the BPNN
model for viscosity.

The calculated results from the present
BPNN model for the viscosities
of oxygenated fuels were first compared with the training and validation
data. Comparison results show that the AARDs of the present BPNN model
from training data and validation data are 1.19 and 1.27%, respectively,
which implies that the present BPNN model correlates the viscosity
data very well. Then, the calculated results from the present BPNN
model were compared with the testing data in order to verify the predictive
ability. A satisfactory performance was found, indicating that the
AARD of the present BPNN model from testing data is 1.30%, which implied
the excellent predictability of this model.

Table 6 lists the
AARDs and MARDs of the present BPNN model from the experimental viscosity
data of each oxygenated fuel. It can be observed that the AARDs for
all oxygenated fuels are less than 3%. In order to compare the performance
of the present BPNN model for different kinds of oxygenated fuels,
the AARDs of the present BPNN model for alcohols, esters, and ethers
are also calculated, which are 1.02, 0.99, and 1.61%, respectively.
It means that the present BPNN model can give good prediction for
the viscosities of different kinds of oxygenated fuels. Figure 3 plots AARDs of the present
BPNN model against critical pressure, critical temperature, mole mass,
and acentric factor and shows that there is no apparent connection
between AARDs and the four parameters.

present BPNN model with different parameters.

To further investigate the overall
accuracy of the present BPNN
model, Figure 4 compares
the experimental and calculated values of the viscosities of all oxygenated
fuels. A very good agreement can be observed, which is also supported
by Table 7. As shown
in Table 7, the absolute
relative deviations of the present BPNN model for 54.89% of total
data (864 points) are below 1%; the absolute relative deviations for
27.89% of total data (439 points) are between 1 and 2%; 9.85% of total
data (155 points) are between 2 and 3%; 6.16% of total data (97 points)
are between 3 and 5%; only the absolute relative deviations for 1.21%
of total data (16 points) are greater than 5%. The AARD and MARD of
total data are calculated to be 1.24 and 10.70%, respectively. The
AARD of the FV model and the model based on EART proposed by our group26 are also provided in Table 6 for comparison. It can be found that the
present BPNN model has a similar total AARD to the FV model and EART
model but a lower total MARD. Moreover, the present BPNN model has
stronger prediction ability than the FV model and EART model because
it can calculate the viscosity of a new oxygenated fuel just using
temperature, pressure, critical pressure, critical temperature, mole
mass, and acentric factor with no experimental viscosity data available.

and experimental data for the viscosities of 31 oxygenated fuels.

4 Conclusions
In this work, a general BPNN viscosity model
was proposed for oxygenated
fuels based on the viscosity data of 31 oxygenated fuels including
esters, alcohols, and ethers in the temperature range from 243.15
to 413.15 K and in the pressure range from 0.1 to 200 MPa. The training
result shows that the BPNN model has the best accuracy when it has
two hidden layers with the neuron numbers of 6 and 12, respectively.
The AARDs of the present BNPP model from training data, validation
data, and testing data are 1.19%, 1.27%, and 1.30%, respectively,
which indicates a good performance in prediction. Comparison result
shows that the BPNN model has better accuracy than the FV model and
EART model and has much stronger prediction ability because it can
predict the viscosity of a new oxygenated fuel at variational temperature
and pressure just using four physical properties (critical temperature,
critical pressure, mole mass, and acentric factor) with no experimental
viscosity data available.
