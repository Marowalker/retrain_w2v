The increasing demand
for renewable materials in the world has
resulted in sustained efforts to utilize biomass in a better way.
Lignin, a natural and abundant polymer in plants, has provided an
ongoing challenge for many researchers seeking ways to better utilize
this abundant resource. Here, we report a very efficient lignin depolymerization
strategy with the assistant of microwave radiation. Copper sulphate
(CuSO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were used to generate hydroxyl radicals to depolymerize lignin
under the irradiation of microwaves. Three different types of lignin,
organosolv lignin, kraft lignin, and alkali lignin, were all successfully
depolymerized using microwave irradiation at a temperature of 110
°C for 7 min. The use of 1H/13C two-dimensional
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy enabled the confirmation of
structural changes, comparing before and after depolymerization. Liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to characterize the
products. Both monomers and oligomers were detected after depolymerization.

Introduction
The increasing concern
regarding the shortage of energy and the
environmental pollution has led to the sustained research effort to
investigate abundant, renewable, and cleaner materials to produce
energy, fuels, or chemicals.1−3 Biomass, a key building block
of biofuels and composed largely of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen,
is one of the most competitive candidates.4−6 Lignin, a well-known
renewable material, is more popular because of the potential to be
used as an abundant resource for the production of aromatics and related
phenolic fine chemicals.7−9 Lignin is a three-dimensional
natural polymer with aromatic rings linked by several typical bonds,
including β-O-4, α-O-4, 4-O-5, β–β,
β-5, and β-1 bond (Scheme 1).4,7,9,11

Scheme 1 Proposed Lignin Structure with Typical Bonds
Several strategies have been
established to isolate lignin from
biomass, including the kraft process, sulfur-free alkali (soda) pulping,
and organosolv processes, generally associated with paper manufacturing.11−14 Kraft pulping is the dominant pulping process over the world accounting
for about 90% of the entire production capacity.9,15 Paper
mills use this method to isolate cellulose fibers by dissolving lignin
and hemicellulose in a solution of sodium sulfite and sodium hydroxide.7 Sulfur-free alkali (soda) pulping process takes
up about 5% of entire pulp production. In this method, 10–15%
NaOH by weight, based on the raw material, is often used for the isolation
of lower lignin content biomass from agricultural wastes.9,13 The lignin removal rate compared to the kraft process is lower,
however the lignin produced is essentially sulfur-free.8 The presence of sulfur in lignin from the kraft
process is potentially a barrier against the application of catalytical
lignin depolymerization approaches because of the poisoning of the
catalysts.9,16 The organosolv process commonly involves
using organic solvents such as alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol)
and organic acids (e.g. formic acid and acetic acid).4,17

Different lignin isolation processes normally produce lignin
with
various structures and also different contents of the typical linkages,
as previously described. However, numerous papers have been published
to establish pathways to degrade different types of lignin.7,11 Lignin catalytic cracking, hydrolysis, gasification, lignin reduction,
and lignin oxidation are the most popular strategies to depolymerize
lignin.7,18 Compared to other methods, lignin reduction
and oxidation methods utilize milder conditions to degrade lignin,
which can thus be suitable for the industry.19,20 Our group has previously reported several oxidative lignin depolymerization
strategies21,22 and also reviewed the recent
developments in the chemical degradation of lignin involving catalytic
oxidation.23 Lignin catalytic oxidation
methods normally show high selectivity in the products formed. It
is an approach that is very promising for generating highly functionalized
oligomeric and monomeric chemicals via lignin catalytic oxidation.10,23

For most of the lignin oxidation strategies, conventional
heating
is required, however, using microwave irradiation is another option.26 Gedye et al.24 compared
oxidation results under conventional heating conditions with those
under microwave irradiation and concluded several advantages from
using microwave irradiation. They concluded that microwave heating
is a highly efficient and potentially reaction-selective heating method.
In some cases, the activation energies of reactions are more readily
achievable under microwave irradiation. Polar materials can generate
more free radicals compared to conventional heating.24,25 Liu et al.27 developed a method to depolymerize
lignin with the assistance of microwave irradiation in isopropyl alcohol
without catalysts. About 45% of low-molecular-weight products were
obtained after the reaction, which contains ethanone, 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)
(1), and ethanone, 1-(4-hydroxy-3, 5-dimethoxy phenyl)
(2) as the monomeric products (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Two Phenolic Products from Lignin
Depolymerization under Microwave
Irradiation
Zhu et al.28 also reported the depolymerization
of lignin with selective Cα–Cβ bond cleavage with a catalyst ferric sulfate and the application
of microwave irradiation. Lignin model compounds were utilized in
these conditions. Their work described microwave-assisted methylation
of benzyl alcohols in the lignin structure, which leads to lignin
degradation and production of phenolic compounds from lignin.29 Wang et al.29 showed
a pathway to depolymerize lignin using polyoxometalate as a catalyst
in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate under microwave irradiation.
Delignification was confirmed with the generation of lower-molecular-weight
phenolic products.

It is well-known that copper catalyst is
an excellent recipient
of quantitative oxidation.25,30,31 Widespread interest has led to the development of copper catalyst
systems for lignin degradation. Zhu et al.32 proposed a two-step lignin depolymerization strategy using a series
of metal chlorides and metal sulphate salts, including CuCl2, CuSO4, FeCl3, MgSO4, and so forth.
These salts were used as a catalyst for lignin methylation with methanol
under the irradiation of microwave first, and Pd/C was used for methylated
lignin hydrogenolysis for the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds afterward.
In this case, the microwave and the copper catalysts were only used
for the methylation step and not for the lignin degradation step.
Pan et al.25 reported a microwave-assisted
oxidation reaction of lignin model compounds with metal salts, including
CuCl2, CrCl3, and MnCl2. In their
study, these metal chloride salts were used together with H2O2 to oxidize lignin model compounds and not the real
lignin. Goñi and Montgomery30 presented
a microwave digest system, with CuO as a catalyst, to depolymerize
lignin at a temperature of 150 °C for 90 min, which generated
a large quantity of phenolic compound from geochemical lignin samples.
However, this process required 90 min to degrade lignin, where the
reaction time was longer than other microwave reactions. A novel microwave-assisted
copper catalyzed lignin degradation method which can proceed readily
warrants investigation.

Compared to other copper complexes,
copper salts, such as CuSO4 and CuCl2, turn
out to be an excellent competitor
because of their good solubility in water, enabling water to be used
as a reaction solvent.32−34 Additionally, these catalysts can be separated from
the low molecular products and can be reused by a simple extraction
after the depolymerization reaction. Herein, we report the use of
CuSO4 in combination with H2O2 as
a catalyst to depolymerize lignin under microwave irradiation. The
whole process was completed within 7 min at a temperature of 110 °C.
Lignin was depolymerized with the production of oligomeric and monomeric
products. The method was shown to be widely applicable with three
different types of lignin, including organosolv lignin, alkali lignin,
and kraft lignin, all being successfully depolymerized. Two-dimensional
nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy was used to confirm
the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds, β–β bonds, and
β-5 bonds after the reaction. Monomeric products, including
vanillic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, syringaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanal,
4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)propanal
were detected and characterized by the liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) technique.

Results and Discussion
Model
Microwave-Assisted Reactions with 1-Phenylethanol
In the
beginning, 1-phenylethanol was used as a model compound for
this reaction to test the oxidation ability of this microwave system.
CuSO4 and H2O2 were chosen as the
catalyst in this system. The percentage conversion of the secondary
alcohol of 1-phenylethanol to a ketone was calculated based on the 1H NMR results, which indicated the ratio of acetophenone to
the products. The signal of the terminal methyl group was used as
a reference and comparison, which appears as a doublet at 1.41 ppm
for 1-phenylethanol and as a singlet at 2.59 ppm for acetophenone.35 From the result, it was shown that the oxidation
reaction only occurred if H2O2 was present,
and the conversion was enhanced by the presence of CuSO4 (Supporting Information Table S1). The
conversion was only 10%, when an autoclave with heat was used instead
of microwave (Table S1, entry 5 in the Supporting Information). This also indicated that microwave is necessary
for accelerating the reaction (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Oxidation reaction of 1-phenylethanol.

The optimization of reaction conditions was carried
out at the
same time. For each part, only one parameter was changed compared
to the initial conditions. First, the effect of the dosages of CuSO4 and H2O2 were investigated. Figure 2 shows the results
of oxidation with different amounts of CuSO4 and H2O2. Figure 2a shows that with the increase of CuSO4 dosage,
the conversion increased from about 26 to 66%. When the amount of
CuSO4 increased beyond 13% of the molar amount of 1-phenylethanol,
the conversion remained steady at around 65%. This indicated that
the dosage of CuSO4 could positively promote the oxidation
reaction to generate more acetophenone.

Figure 2 Effect of CuSO4 dosage on the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol.

The effect of the quantity of H2O2 used
in
the reaction was also investigated. As the results show in Figure 2b, with the increase
of H2O2 dosage, the conversion increased from
about 13 to 66%. When the amount of H2O2 increased
beyond 2.0 × 10–3 mL/mg to 1-phenylethanol,
the conversion slightly decreased to 60%. This indicated that the
dosage of H2O2 could also positively promote
the oxidation reaction to generate more acetophenone.

In addition,
the temperature and the reaction time were also investigated.
However, the temperature did not significantly affect the oxidation
conversion. When the temperature was increased from 80 to 110 °C
with other conditions kept constant, the conversion showed no great
difference (about 56 and 58%, respectively). Similarly, the conversion
to the product did not show a significant shift when the reaction
time was increased from 10 to 30 min.

Microwave Reaction with
Lignin
The optimized reaction
conditions established with the model compound were then applied to
lignin. In this study, organosolv lignin, kraft lignin, and alkali
lignin were selected to perform the lignin degradation reaction under
microwave irradiation. These three lignin samples were treated with
methanol to obtain a methanol-soluble part and a methanol-insoluble
part to form the lignin with narrow polydispersity to follow the depolymerization
easily and effectively. Six lignin samples including methanol-insoluble
organosolv lignin, methanol-soluble organosolv lignin, methanol-insoluble
kraft lignin, methanol-soluble kraft lignin, methanol-insoluble alkali
lignin, and methanol-soluble alkali lignin were obtained; the molecular
weights and polydispersity (D̵) of the six
lignin samples are listed in Table 1, entry 1.

2	Mn/D̵ after the
reaction	400/34.6	400/4.3	600/5.6	400/5.5	600/6.2	500/4.4	
All six types of lignin samples
were subjected to microwave treatments
to effect depolymerization. For each reaction, the initial reaction
condition, 0.1 mass ratio of CuSO4 to lignin (5 mg of CuSO4 to 50 mg of lignin) and 1 × 10–3 mL/mg
of H2O2 to lignin (0.5 mL of H2O2 to 50 mg of lignin) were used to depolymerize lignin under
microwave irradiation at the temperature of 80 °C for 10 min.
After reactions, the solvents were removed to give the depolymerized
lignin products, which were characterized by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) to give the molecular weights (Figure S1–S3 in the Supporting Information).

The results in Table 1, entry 2 suggest
that this method can apply and degrade different
lignin types with ranges of different molecular weights and that the
methanol pretreatment is not necessary and does not require narrow
polydispersity samples as in other depolymerization techniques. Consequently,
organosolv lignin, kraft lignin, and alkali lignin were subjected
directly without any pretreatment to the microwave depolymerization
method to investigate the depolymerization ability of the microwave
system to original lignin samples. These three original lignin samples
were analyzed by SEC and also by 2D-NMR spectroscopy to show the differences
in the structure before and after microwave treatment (2D-NMR results
in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). These three types of lignin have overall molecular weights around Mn = 1500 with quite a high polydispersity.

Table 2, entries
1 and 2, summarizes the molecular weight and polydispersity of organosolv
lignin, kraft lignin, and alkali lignin before and after the reactions
using the initial reaction condition as described above. The SEC chromatograms
of the molecular weights of organosolv lignin, kraft lignin, and alkali
lignin before and after the initial reactions are shown in Figure
S4 in the Supporting Information.

3	after optimized condition	120/3.2	150/2.8	180/3.6	
As the results show in Table 2, in entries 1 and 2, compared to the original
lignin
samples, there was a significant molecular weight decrease and polydispersity
increase of the three original lignin samples observed after the initial
reaction. After the reaction, ethyl acetate was used to extract the
low-molecular-weight fractions from the product. Table 3 summarizes the yield of ethyl
acetate-soluble fraction before and after the initial reactions. The
yield of the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the three samples all
increased from less than 16% to more than 30% (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). This indicated that the
all these three lignin samples were depolymerized with the generation
of low-molecular-weight fractions.

Condition Optimization
of Lignin Depolymerization
Following
the confirmation of lignin depolymerization, further work to optimize
the reaction conditions was undertaken to maximize the yields of lower-molecular-weight
fractions. In this case, alkali lignin, with higher molecular weight
than the other two lignin samples, was used for optimizing the reaction
conditions. As the reaction with 1-phenylethanol demonstrated, the
dosages of CuSO4 and H2O2 can positively
affect the microwave reaction. On this basis, different dosages of
CuSO4 and H2O2 were used to degrade
alkali lignin. After the reaction, ethyl acetate was used to extract
the low-molecular-weight fractions from the reaction mixture. The
SEC chromatograms are listed in Figure 3.

Figure 3 SEC chromatograms of microwave degradation of alkali lignin
under
different conditions: (a) different CuSO4 dosages; (b)
different H2O2 dosages; and (c) different reaction
times.

The effect of different levels
of CuSO4 and H2O2 were investigated
separately. For each part, only one
parameter was investigated, compared to initial conditions. The dosage
of CuSO4 was calculated based on the mass ratio with lignin
(Figure 3a). With the
increasing dosage of CuSO4, the signal from SEC shown by
the red dash line at lower retention time decreased in intensity.
This indicated that a higher molecular weight fraction was depolymerized
with the increasing mass ratio of CuSO4 to lignin in the
reaction mixture. Meanwhile, the intensity at a high retention time,
which is marked by a black dash line at 17–19 min, only shifted
slightly. When the mass ratio of CuSO4 increased from 0.14
to 0.18, the SEC intensity marked by the red dash line decreased.
When the mass ratio of CuSO4 was increased more than 0.18,
similar results were obtained; hence the mass ratio of 0.18 CuSO4 to lignin was considered as the most efficient mass ratio
for lignin degradation, for the conditions that were tested.

The effect of varying the amount of H2O2 was
also investigated, with the results shown in Figure 3b. All reactions were carried out with 0.1
mass ratio of CuSO4 to lignin at 80 °C for 10 min.
The dosage of H2O2 was calculated based on the
mass ratio with lignin. When the ratio of H2O2 (30 wt %) to lignin was increased from 1.0 × 10–3 to 1.4 × 10–3 mL/mg, a shift in the molecular-weight
distribution was observed, evidenced by the decrease in the intensity
of the SEC signal in the retention time region of 12.5–15 min.
This provides strong evidence of the loss of high-molecular-weight
material, and the corresponding increase in the intensity of the signal
in the 16–19 min region of the chromatogram was consistent
with this. However, when the ratio of H2O2 to
lignin increased from 1.4 × 10–3 to 1.8 ×
10–3 mL/mg, a shift in the molecular-weight distribution
to higher molecular weights was observed. The intensity of the signal
at the retention times marked by the red dash line increased while
the signal intensity at the retention time marked by the black dash
line increased. Interestingly, the peak that appeared at 17.5–18
min with the ratio of 1.0 × 10–3 mL/mg H2O2 (marked with the black dashed line) shifted
to lower retention times at higher H2O2 dosage.
This indicated that the increasing ratio of H2O2 could certainly promote the degradation reaction, however, when
an excess amount of H2O2 was added into the
reaction, repolymerization of the smaller fractions could occur. The
reason can be that with the increasing dosage of H2O2, more hydroxide radicals can be generated, which could lead
to repolymerization. Competition between depolymerization and repolymerization
has been previously reported when radical reaction mechanisms are
involved.21

The effect of time on
the reaction of this system was also studied.
All reactions were carried out with a 0.1 mass ratio of CuSO4 to lignin and 1.0 × 10–3 mL/mg of H2O2 to lignin at 80 °C. The depolymerized lignin products
were extracted by ethyl acetate to give about 40–50 wt % of
products and were analyzed by SEC to give the results shown in Figure 3c. As the curves
showed, the SEC signal intensity marked by the red dash line, which
is the depolymerized oligomer, increased with the increase in the
reaction time. Again, the striking appearance of a signal intensity
at ∼18 min retention time and after 1 min of reaction time
suggests rapid formation of a low-molecular-weight material. This
steadily increased in intensity up to 7 min, but at 9 min, repolymerization
was again evident as the intensity of this peak decreased significantly.
Thus, it was decided to stop the reaction at 7 min to have the best
depolymerization.

The effect of temperature was also tested
with 0.1 mass ratio of
CuSO4 to lignin and 1.0 × 10–3 mL/mg
of H2O2 to lignin for 10 min. The results show
that higher temperature is better for depolymerization (Supporting Information, Figure S5), however,
to keep the reaction mild, a reaction temperature of 110 °C was
set.

In conclusion, the optimum conditions based on these investigations
for microwave-assisted lignin degradation were chosen as 0.18 mass
ratio of CuSO4 to lignin and 1.4 × 10–3 mL/mg of H2O2 to lignin at the temperature
of 110 °C for 7 min. This condition was then applied for all
three original lignin samples (Table 2). The SEC results of ethyl acetate-extracted products
were compared with the initial conditions, which is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S6).

As
the results show in Table 2, entry 3, all these three lignin samples showed better
depolymerization under the optimized conditions chosen, compared to
the initial conditions. The overall molecular weight of the ethyl
acetate-extracted fraction decreased from 600 g/mol to less than 200
g/mol. Moreover, the low-molecular-weight peak, which appeared at
higher retention time, increased in intensity with the peaks at lower
retention time decreasing (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).

The percentage of ethyl acetate-soluble
fractions in different
lignin samples is listed in Table 3. After reaction, the yield of ethyl acetate-soluble
fractions increased by more than 2 times. The reason is that the amount
of small-molecular-weight fractions increased after microwave treatment
because of the depolymerization of lignin.

Control reactions
of this catalyst system for lignin degradation
were carried out with alkali lignin as the starting material (summarized
in Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The yield of ethyl acetate fractions from the reaction without
CuSO4 and H2O2 and also with only
CuSO4 or H2O2 was 15–18%,
and there were no significant increase from the original lignin (15%).
This indicated that both CuSO4 and H2O2 are necessary for this reaction, which is also consistent with our
optimization condition results. A reaction using an autoclave with
heat was also used for this reaction instead of the microwave, which
only gave 20% yield of the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction that was
significant lower than the yield (52%) using microwave irradiation.
The hypothesis is that CuSO4 plays an important role as
a catalyst to generate hydroxyl radicals from H2O2, and the irradiation of microwave accelerated the reaction, and
these radicals degrade the lignin as previously reported.32

The ethyl acetate-soluble fractions, which
yield about 50%, were
analyzed by 2D-NMR spectroscopy to characterize the monomeric and
oligomeric products. Figure 4 shows three typical bonds detected by 2D-NMR spectroscopy.
The 2D-NMR spectra of the alkali lignin and depolymerized alkali lignin
are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 4 Different bonds in lignin detected by 2D-NMR spectroscopy.

Figure 5 2D-NMR spectra of alkali lignin and depolymerized
alkali lignin.

Comparing Figure 5a,b, the 2D-NMR spectra after
microwave-assisted lignin depolymerization
indicate that the β-O-4 bonds, β–β bonds,
and β-5 bonds were cleaved. The signals from each bond, which
existed in alkali lignin, disappeared after depolymerization (the
dash circle in Figure 5b). This indicated that this microwave-assisted strategy could efficiently
degrade lignin via cleaving these particular three bond types, which
leads to the generation of oligomeric and monomeric products. Similar
results were also obtained from kraft lignin and organosolv lignin
(Supporting Information, Figure S7).

LC–MS was used to analyze the extracted low molecular products.
The compounds detected are shown in Figure 6 and the LC–MS chromatogram results
are shown in Figure 7. From the LC–MS results, seven monomers have been detected.
These are vanillic acid (compound 1), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
(compound 2), vanillin (compound 3), syringaldehyde
(compound 4), 2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanal (compound 5), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (compound 6), and 2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)propanal
(compound 7).

Figure 6 LC–MS detected monomers from depolymerized
lignin products.

Figure 7 Liquid chromatogram spectra
of the extracted low-molecular-weight
products from (a) depolymerized alkali lignin, (b) depolymerized kraft
lignin, and (c) depolymerized organosolv lignin.

Figure 7 shows
the
LC chromatograms of three depolymerized lignin products. From these
three lignin samples, vanillic acid (compound 1), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde
(compound 2), and vanillin (compound 3)
were all generated in common. This demonstrated that microwave irradiation
was very effective in the production of these three monomers with
multiple types of lignin as feedstock. Moreover, depolymerized kraft
lignin and depolymerized organosolv lignin also showed the presence
of other aromatic monomers compared to the depolymerized alkali lignin.
These observations are consistent with differences in the original
structures of each lignin sample with different contents of G units
and S units. The wide broad peaks after 36 min in all these three
LC chromatograms were assigned to dimeric or oligomeric products.
The mass spectra are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S8–S10).

This one-pot catalyst system can
degrade lignin into monomeric
and oligomeric products in 7 min with CuSO4/H2O2 as catalysts. MnCl2 and CuO, which have
been reported28,30 for lignin model compound degradation
under the irradiation of microwave, have been attempted and compared
with our catalyst under this condition. The yield of the ethyl acetate-soluble
fraction from alkali lignin using MnCl2 and CuO were 41
and 43%, respectively, which were less than our yield of 52%. These
results indicate that our optimized condition has a potential to be
used for other catalyst systems. In addition, a milder reaction condition
was used in our system compared to other lignin degradation systems
reported using different copper catalysts.30,36

Conclusions
In this work, we presented a very efficient
approach to depolymerize
lignin with CuSO4 and H2O2 as catalysts
under microwave irradiation conditions. These conditions can depolymerize
different lignin samples into low-molecular-weight monomeric and oligomeric
products at a temperature of 110 °C for only 7 min with power
of 80 W. Monomers, such as vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and vanillic
acid were detected and characterized in the products. The high efficiency
of this method showed the potential to utilize lignin for the production
of valuable low-molecular-weight aromatics in industrial applications.

Instruments and Measurements
CEM Discover SP-microwave
synthesizer was used to perform all microwave reactions. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRK-600 spectrometer operating
at 600 MHz for solutions in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6. The molecular weight of isolated lignin and depolymerized
samples were measured by SEC performed on a Tosoh EcosHLC-8320 system
equipped with both refractive index and ultraviolet (UV) detectors
(UV detection, λ = 280 nm) using Tosoh alpha 4000 and 2000 columns.

UV detector in SEC chromatograms set at 280 nm was used to analyze
all depolymerized samples and isolated lignin. Calibration curves
were obtained using polystyrene standards. LC–UV/MS was performed
using an Agilent 1260 Infinity liquid chromatograph system coupled
with a 6120 series quadrupole mass spectrometer. A column of Kinetex

cycle time of 1.57 s per cycle.

Isolation of kraft lignin from
black liquor was undertaken according to the method we have previously
reported.22 Elemental analysis of carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur gave the following result (average
over three measurements): carbon 65.30%, hydrogen 6.07%, nitrogen
<0.3% (detection limit), and sulfur 2.57%.

Microwave-mediated
oxidation of 1-phenylethanol with copper sulfate
involved using a 10 mL microwave reactor vial charged with 1-phenylethanol
(0.05 mL, d = 1.013 g/mL, 50 mg, 0.41 mmol), 2.5
mL of water, 2.5 mL of ACN, 5 mg (0.03 mmol) of copper sulfate, and
0.5 mL (30 wt % in H2O, 0.15 g, 4.41 mmol) of H2O2, which was placed in the microwave reactor and heated
to 80 °C for 10 min with a maximum microwave power of 80 W. The
resulting mixture was then partitioned between water (30 mL) and ethyl
acetate (2 × 20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed
with saturated brine (1 × 30 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium
sulfate. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the product was then
analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine the percentage
conversion of secondary alcohol to ketone.

Isolation of the
high-molecular-weight fraction of lignin was undertaken
using a solubility method reported before.21 The molecular-weight distribution of the methanol-insoluble fraction
of lignin (M-lignin) was determined by SEC.

Microwave-Assisted Reaction
with 1-Phenylethanol
Several
reactions have been tested to optimize the reaction conditions. The
typical reaction procedure is as follows: 1-phenylethanol (0.05 mL, d = 1.013 g/mL, 50 mg, 0.41 mmol), 2.5 mL of water, 2.5
mL of ACN, 5 mg (0.03 mmol) of copper sulfate, and 0.5 mL (30 wt %
in H2O, 0.15 g, 4.41 mmol) of H2O2 were placed in the 10 mL vessel of a microwave reactor and heated
to 80 °C for 10 min with a maximum microwave power of 80 W. For
each reaction, 0.41 mmol (50 mg, 0.05 mL) 1-phenylethanol was used
as the substrate, and the yield of total recovered material was always
around 90–95%.

Procedure for Microwave Oxidation of Lignin
with Copper Sulfate
Several reactions have been tested to
optimize the reaction conditions.
The typical reaction procedure is as follows: A 10 mL microwave reactor
vial was charged with 50 mg of lignin, 2.5 mL of water, 2.5 mL of
ACN, 5 mg (0.03 mmol) of copper sulfate, and 0.5 mL (30 wt % in H2O, 0.15 g, 4.41 mmol) of H2O2. The vial
was then placed in the microwave reactor and heated to 80 °C
for 10 min with a maximum microwave power of 80 W. The solvent was
then removed; the remaining solid was dissolved in a 10 mmol/L solution
of LiBr in DMF to give a concentration of 2 mg/mL of oxidation products;
and the solution was analyzed by SEC.
