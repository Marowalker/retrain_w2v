polymer electrolyte films (poly((vinylidene fluoride)-co-hexafluoropropylene)/LiClO4@90:10 w/w, PHL10)
were prepared by solution-casting technique and the effect of various
dosages of electron beam (EB) irradiation on structure, morphology,
thermal, dielectric, and conductivity properties at various dosages.
The atomic force microscope topography image shows substantial change
in surface morphology due to irradiation and the modification of chemical
bonds through chain scission process with increased EB dose was confirmed
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies. NMR studies confirm
the change in structural properties due to irradiation. The X-ray
diffractometer confirms the decreased crystallinity from 50.10 for
unirradiated film to 40.96 at 120 kGy doses; hence, increase in amorphousity
due to a decrease in melting temperature from 460 to 418 °C leads
to the degradation of the polymer, and the differential scanning calorimetry
study reveals the decreased crystallinity with increased irradiation
dose. The dielectric and modulus parameters are observed to decrease
with increasing frequency as well as temperature. The conductivity
increases with frequency and EB dose due to the increased segmental
motion of charged ions by chain scission/cross-linking process. The
high conductivity of 1.81 × 10–3 S/cm with
the corresponding relaxation time of 1.697 × 10–6 at 120 kGy dose was observed. The conduction mechanism reveals an
Ohmic behavior and the I–V plot exhibits a gradual increase in current with applied voltage
as well as irradiation dose. The electrochemical performance of the
irradiated polymer electrolyte was improved significantly and hence
the polymer electrolytes can be used in solid-state batteries and
storage applications after altering the properties by the influence
of irradiation.

1 Introduction
Polymers have been used
in many potential applications due to their
excellent physical properties and in various potential applications
such as safety systems of nuclear power plants after exposure to various
radiation energies, medical usage, packing, optoelectronics,1 and others. However, modification of physical
properties by irradiation has become an attractive area.2 Many investigations have revealed that the interaction
of radiations with polymers leads to rupture of the chemical bonds
of the polymer chain, resulting in the formation of polymer fragments
and free radicals.2,3 These changes in polymer chain
caused by the occurrence of chain scission/cross-linking as a result
of rearrangement in the molecular-level microstructure or change in
chemistry.4,5 The effect of radiation on the polymer depends
on many factors, like energy, type of radiation and dosimetry conditions,
and chemical and physical properties of the polymer. From literature,
it has seen that various irradiation techniques have been used to
modify the physical properties of the polymer.6,7 There
are various radiation energies such as electron beam (EB), γ,
ions, X-ray, ultraviolet; among these, the electron beam (EB) irradiation
is a rapidly developing technique owing to its simple and pollution-free
use to improve the physiochemical properties of the polymers.8 It can change the structure and thermal properties
of copolymers and also break the crystal into micropolar regions that
interact only through electrostatic coupling.9 The degree of crystallinity of the polymer electrolytes have been
reported to decrease in most of the semicrystalline polymers at high
dose irradiation.10 The copolymers after
exposure to high energies can exhibit high electromechanical performance,
and such materials are used in sensor and transducer applications.11 It is also important to understand the charge
transport mechanism in the polymers by studying the electrical conductivity
and dielectric relaxation upon EB irradiation.6,12 Few
studies have reported changes in thermal property, structural arrangement,
surface morphology, and electrical conductivity upon EB irradiation
on copolymers like polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), etc.13,14 In the present case, poly((vinylidene fluoride)-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) is one of the copolymer considered
as a suitable host due to various interesting properties like high
dielectric constant (ε = 8.4) that support dissociation of salts
like Na+ and Li+, low crystallinity, which can
improve conductivity. Excellent chemical stability due to crystalline
phase vinylidene supported by hexafluoropropylene (HFP) in amorphous
phase and possibilities of new applications like optoelectronic devices,
sensor, supercapacitor, medical radiation therapy, and food processing13,15 are the reasons irradiation of copolymer has been receiving more
attention. The polymer electrolytes based on lithium salts have been
preferably studied because Li+ cations are the smallest
and can easily move in a polymer matrix through transient coordinate
bonds and improves the ion-transport process. Hence, the present study
investigated the effects of EB irradiation on thermal, dielectric,
and conductivity of PVDF-HFP/LiClO4 polymer electrolytes
and reported the modifications.

2 Characterization
Techniques
The unirradiated and irradiated polymer electrolyte
films were
characterized by using various techniques; the atomic force microscopy
(AFM) in noncontact mode is used to study the surface topology. The
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurement was done
with the help of Bruker Alpha Eco ATR FT-IR spectroscopy between 500
and 3000 cm–1 ranges and Bruker ascend 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer is used to record the 13C NMR spectra at room
temperature using dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. The Rigaku Miniflex
500 tabletop powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to study the structural
properties of materials. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential
thermal analysis (DTA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
are studied using TA instruments Q-600 heating from 30 to 700 °C
at the heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen flow rate of
approximately 20 mL/min. The dielectric measurement was done by Wayne
Kerr Precision Impedance Analyser 6500B in the frequency range 40
Hz to 1 MHz and at different temperatures. Cyclic voltammeter analysis
was done by using the CHI-660E electrochemical workstation at room
temperature.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Atomic Force Microscopic Study of Unirradiated
and Irradiated Film
The surface roughness factor of the PHL10
polymer electrolyte films before and after irradiation was studied
by AFM images as shown in Figure 1a–d. The change in root mean square (RMS) roughness
values has observed after exposure to EB irradiation.

Figure 1 Atomic force microscopic
images of (a) PHL unirradiated (inset,
PVDF-HFP) and irradiated with (b) 40 kGy, (c) 80 kGy, and (d) 120
kGy dosage.

The host polymer PVDF-HFP
exhibits the RMS value of 120.9 nm, which
decreases to 116.5 nm for unirradiated PHL10 film, confirming the
formation of complexation. The modified surface of polymer electrolytes
due to irradiation effect is shown in Figure 1b–d, note the RMS values increased
to 117.6, 121.8, and 123.4 nm for 40, 80, and 120 kGy doses, respectively.16,17 The significant change in surface morphology with increased EB dose
confirms that the polymer degradation increases the amorphous phase
in polymer electrolytes after irradiation.18,19

3.2 X-ray Diffraction Study of Unirradiated and
Irradiated Film
X-ray diffractograms of unirradiated and
irradiated PHL10 polymer films are shown in Figure 2. The XRD peaks observed at 2θ = 16.79,
19.49, and 26.19° illustrate the partial semicrystalline nature
of pure PVDF-HFP.15,20,21 When PHL10 electrolyte film is exposed to EB energy, it observed
that the disappearance of peak at 2θ = 16.79 and 26.19 with
corresponding planes (100), (021) indicates the amorphous state of
the polymer21 and at 2θ = 38.30°
with plane (111) intensity significantly decreased and becomes broader
for 120 kGy dose. The broadening and increase in intensity of the
crystalline peak of the unirradiated film at 2θ = 19.90°
plane (110) upon irradiation dose confirm the decrease in crystallite
size. The prominent peak observed at 2θ(111) = 38.30° for
PVDF-HFP electrolyte was found to decrease significantly with irradiation
and shifted to 2θ(111) = 38.90° for 120 kGy dose, confirming
the decrease in crystallinity by chain scissoning process; the results
were in agreement with earlier report.10 The observed results noticed change in the crystalline phase of
the polymer electrolyte after EB irradiation due to formation of defect
states, resulting in destruction of the polymer chain by high radiation
energy.

after EB irradiation.

Using Debye–Scherrer equation, for every θ (sharp
peaks) values, the average crystallite separation (R), strain (ε), crystallite size (D), and percentage
of crystallinity (χ) were calculated using the following equations 1   2   3   4  where k is the shape factor,
whose value is assumed to be 0.9, λ is the wavelength of the
X-ray with value of 0.154 Å, and Ac and Aa are the areas under crystalline
and amorphous peaks, respectively, and the calculated parameters are
presented in Table 1. The average crystallite size and strain values were calculated
for the unirradiated and irradiated polymer electrolytes at 40, 80,
and 120 kGy using the Williamson–Hall method as shown in Figure 3.

plots for PHL electrolyte before and after
EB irradiation.

Figure 2 clearly
shows that the crystalline peak of the unirradiated film at 2θ
= 19.49° broadens and the intensity increases with increase in
the EB dose and the full-width at half maximum also increases, indicating
a decrease in the crystallite size. The results show that a decrease
in the degree of crystallinity confirms an increase in the amorphous
region and is attributed to the degradation of the polymer chains.22 The obtained results are in good agreement with
the AFM and FT-IR results.

3.3 FT-IR Spectroscopy Study
of Unirradiated and
Irradiated Film
A comparison of the peak intensity and shift
of the FT-IR spectra of unirradiated film and EB-irradiated PHL10
polymer electrolyte at different EB doses is presented in Figure 4. The spectra change
with increase in EB dose. The change and shift in the vibrational
bands of PVDF-HFP observed at 1070, 868, and 608 to 1075, 870, and
610 cm–1 with reducing peak intensity after doping
with LiClO4 salt confirmed the complexity between salt
and polymer matrix (unirradiated). The shift in the band of unirradiated
electrolyte from 1656 to 1666 cm–1 for 120 kGy was
assigned to the C=O bond stretching, confirming the degradation
of polymer electrolyte after irradiation.23 The shift in the band of vinylidene group of host polymer from 1402
to 1404 cm–1 at 120 kGy is attributed to the deformation
of the CH2 band due to C–H bond scissioring upon
increased irradiation dosage. The band at 1170 assigned to the CF2 bond without irradiation was shifted to 1168 after irradiation
with 120 kGy EB dose with significant decrease in peak intensity,
indicating increased amorphousity in the irradiated polymer electrolyte
due to the formation of defects by high radiation energy, in turn,
confirming the predominant chain scission and cross-linking processes
in polymer electrolyte due to EB irradiation.24

Figure 4 FT-IR
spectra of PHL10 polymer electrolyte before and after EB
irradiation at different dosages.

The observed results confirm that the EB irradiation can
modify
the chemical bonds through oxidative chain scission process and increase
the amorphousity in the polymer electrolyte; this was clearly reported
in our previous publication.25 It can be
illustrated that the decrease in peak intensity (transmittance increases)
with increase in the dose to 120 kGy results from the cross-linking
and the decrease in transmittance with increase in the irradiation
dose is attributed to the predomination of chain scission over cross-linking
with increasing EB dose.26 The observed
results confirm the alteration in structural properties after EB irradiation.

3.4 Thermal Analysis of Unirradiated and Irradiated
Film
TGA/DTA is used to study the thermal stability and degradation
of PHL10 polymer electrolyte films before and after irradiation, as
shown in Figure 5a,b.
The thermogram reveals that a single weight loss in the temperature
range of 420–480 °C for pure PVDF-HFP is attributed to
the degradation of the polymer backbone and the DTA curve presents
an endothermic peak at 154 °C, as shown in Figure 5c, which is associated with the melting temperature
of the crystalline phase of the PVDF-HFP.27 Three major weight loss regions are observed in the TG curves; the
first stage, at around 105 °C, is due to the loss of water content,
suggesting first degradation step of carbon–hydrogen bond scission
and leads to the formation of hydrogen fluoride bonds. The second
stage in the range 110–320 °C is the loss of dopant from
the polymer matrix; therefore, complex degradation process results
in decrease in degradation temperatures to 321, 302, 297, and 290
°C in DTA for unirradiation, 40, 80, and 120 kGy doses, respectively.
It is clear from the observed results that the thermal stability of
the polymer electrolyte films increased with increase in dose.28

polymer
electrolyte films. (c) TG/DT curves for pure PVDF-HFP. (d) Percentage
of residual against EB irradiation dosage in the temperature range
295–330 and 540–565 °C.

The third major loss in 330–565 °C (residual
decomposition)
was attributed to the destruction of polymeric chain backbone by decrease
in degradation temperatures to 460, 456, 450, and 418 °C in DTA
corresponding to unirradiation, 40, 80, and 120 kGy, respectively,
clearly indicating that the change in molecular structure of the polymer
matrix leads to increase in amorphousity at higher dosage.12 The remaining residues due to degradation with
increasing dose in two temperature ranges 295–330 and 540–565
°C are presented in Figure 5d, corresponding to the decomposition of host polymer
chain with increased dose. The initial decomposition temperature of
the thermogram for the irradiated films reveals a gradual decrease
in melting temperatures (Tm) and a shift
toward the lower end with dose, confirming the change in molecular
structure as well as decreased weight of polymer electrolyte is a
result of the creation of free radical via oxidative degradation process
leading to increase in the amorphousity and decrease in crystalline
region at high EB dosage.12,29 Hence, these results
confirm the influence of irradiation and are well agreed with the
obtained XRD results.

3.5 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC) Analysis
The change in melting temperature (Tm) and percentage of crystallinity (χc) of PHL10
polymer electrolytes before and after EB irradiation was investigated
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms, as presented
in Figure 6. From the
DSC thermograms, the melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) are
determined before and after irradiation. It is observed that Tm was decreased with increase in EB dose, indicating
the decrease in crystallinity. The shift in Tm of unirradiated film down from 157.39 to 153.23 °C at
120 kGy EB dose indicated the decreasing number of tie molecules in
the amorphous phase by chain scission process, which simultaneously
weakens the interlamellar connection upon increased irradiation dose.
The significant reduction in the cohesive forces between the long-range
and the intermolecular interaction between polymer chains is a reason
for decrease in Tm with increase in EB
dose. The decreased Tm results in decrease
in crystallinity and leads to the degradation of the polymer chain
at higher dosage due to chain scissoring process to destruct the crystalline
region by forming defects resulting in the break in the long polymer
chain at 120 kGy EB dose and hence increase in the amorphousity of
the polymer electrolyte with increased EB dosage, as reported in our
previous publications.30

Figure 6 DSC curves of PVDF-HFP/LiClO4 (90:10) polymer electrolytes
before and after EB irradiation at different dosages.

The study of crystallinity (χc) of the irradiated
polymer electrolyte is important because it is the key point influencing
the conductivity of the polymer electrolyte films. The percentage
of crystallinity (χc%) was calculated by the following
equation 5  where ΔHm is the change in enthalpy
or melting enthalpy and ΔHmo is the heat of fusion of pure
PVDF, which is equal to 104.7 J/g
when the material is assumed to be 100% crystalline. The melting enthalpy
(ΔHm) was calculated by using the
relation 6  The value of melting enthalpy (ΔHm) and percentage of crystallinity (χc%) and melting temperatures of unirradiated and EB-irradiated
polymer electrolyte are shown in Table 2. From the table, it clear that the values of thermal
parameters for PHL10 polymer electrolyte decreased with increase in
EB irradiation dose, as shown in Figure 7, and the values are lower than that of the
host and unirradiated polymer electrolyte, clearly suggesting that
there is a change in organic functional groups and an interruption
of the polymer chains coordinate with salt systems after exposure
to high radiation dose and an enhancement in the free volume regions.
Therefore, the samples tend to change toward disordered state (amorphous)
due to chain scission and subsequent reduction in molecular weight.
The result confirms the increased amorphisity in the irradiated polymer
film.31,32 This observation is in correlation with
the XRD results.

3.6 Dielectric Property of Unirradiated and Irradiated
Film
The real (ε′) and imaginary (ε″)
parts of dielectric parameters of unirradiated and irradiated PHL10
electrolyte films as a function of frequency at different temperatures
are studied and presented in Figure 8. The dielectric constant (ε′) of a material
is related to the dipole moments polarizability, which arises from
electric dipoles they can change the orientation of polarization subjected
to the applied electric field. The dielectric behavior of polymeric
materials is frequency dependent in lower frequency and frequency
independent in higher frequency region.33 The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric parameters were calculated
by the following relations 7   8  where d is the thickness
of the sample, A is the electrode area, ε0 is the dielectric permittivity in a vacuum (8.85 × 10–12 F/m), and ω is the angular frequency.

Figure 8 Variation in
dielectric constant (ε′) and dielectric
loss (ε″) with frequency at different temperatures for
unirradiated and EB-irradiated PHL10 electrolyte films.

From Figure 8, it
is observed that the dielectric parameters (ε′ and ε″)
decrease suddenly with increase in frequency probably because dipole
polarization failed to change the direction of orientation with the
applied field and increase at low frequencies due to the accumulation
of charges between the polymer electrolyte film and the electrode.
But, it is seen that ε′ and ε″ increased
with temperature for unirradiated and all irradiated polymer electrolyte
films because of increase in charge carrier density due to increased
dissociation of ion aggregation at a higher temperature, and it obeys
the universal law of dielectric response.22

The increasing trend of ε′ at different temperatures
is attributed to the formation of defects or disorders in the band
gaps due to chain scissoning; it can result in more delocalization
of charge carriers in electrolyte films, which confirmed the irradiation
effect.22,34

The variation in the dielectric constant
(ε′) against
EB at different temperatures are shown in Figure 9; it is observed that ε′ increases
with increased temperature. At high EB dose, the cross-linking of
free radicals may stop the orientation of ions with the applied field,
which leads to reduction in the population of induced free radicals,
hence the polarization of trapped and bound charges failed. This process
manifests that the irradiation-induced charge gradually fail to follow
the applied field causing a reduction in the electronic oscillations
at higher energy dosage.35,36 It may be because of
the rearrangement of amorphous phase caused by the higher energy effect
of amorphous phase caused by rearrangement of atoms and redistribution
of primary defects by radiation influence is region to decrease the
ε′ with increased EB dose.34,37

Figure 9 Plot of the
variation in the dielectric constant of PHL10 films
with dosage.

3.7 Electric
Modulus of Unirradiated and Irradiated
Film
The electric modulus M* = M′ + iM″, here the real (M′) and imaginary (M″) parts of the
complex electric modulus (M*) correspond to energy
storage and energy dissipation, respectively. The dielectric processes
can be explained more clearly and accurately by modulus studies and
are calculated from ε′ and ε″ values using
the relations 9   10  The real
(M′) and
imaginary (M″) parts of the complex modulus
formalism M* as a function of frequency for unirradiated
and irradiated PHL10 electrolyte films are shown in Figure 10. It is observed that M′ approaches zero at low frequency, indicating negligible
contribution from electrode polarization, and increases with frequency
due to lack of required amount of restoring force that governs the
mobility of charge carriers under the action of an applied electric
field, thereby supporting the long-range mobility corresponding to
direct current (dc) conductivity. The relaxation process occurs at
high frequencies, suggesting short-range mobility of charge carriers
corresponding to alternating current (ac) conductivity. The relaxation
curve at lower frequency indicates that facile hopping of charge carriers
from one site to another causes short-range mobility, and at high
frequency, the transition of charge carriers from long-range to short-range
mobility leads to an increase in dc conductivity.38

Figure 10 Variation in electric modulus as a function of frequency
at different
temperatures for PHL10 electrolyte films before and after irradiation.

The shift in peak toward higher
frequency with increase in temperature
indicates a decrease in the relaxation time due to the distribution
of free charges.39−41 The movement of charge carriers becomes faster with
increasing temperature, thus the charge carriers are thermally activated,
signifying that the polymer electrolytes are ionic conductors at high
temperatures. The capacitive nature of the irradiated polymer electrolyte
films39,40 was confirmed by the tail in the plots of M′ versus log(f), as shown in Figure 10.

The variation
in relaxation time with dose is shown in Figure 11. It is observed
that the decrease in relaxation time with increasing irradiation dose
assisted the formation of dipoles to follow the motion of the alternating
field39 and the lowest relaxation time
(τ) 1.69 × 10–6 was observed for 120
kGy doses. The relaxation time (τ) was calculated from the maximum
frequency peak position of M″ using the relation 11  where fmax is
the frequency, corresponding to the maximum peak position in the M″ versus log(f) plots in Figure 10, and the calculated
relaxation time for unirradiated and irradiated films is presented
in Table 3. The observed
results confirmed that the irradiation process can change the modulus
properties of the polymeric materials.

time (τ) as a function of the EB
dose.

3.8 Cole–Cole Plots of Unirradiated and
Irradiated Film
The Cole–Cole model was adopted to
describe the dielectric relaxation process and to characterize the
complex electric modulus response of materials to the electric field.
The Cole–Cole plot for unirradiated and EB-irradiated PHL10
electrolyte film at different dosages and constant temperature 373
K is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 Cole–Cole plot of the PHL10 film before and after EB irradiation
at a constant temperature of 373 K.

The semicircular arc observed at initial EB dose in the Cole–Cole
plot is attributed to the ac conductivity contribution, it disappeared
at the irradiation dose at 120 kGy is corresponds to decrease in relaxation
time and attributed to segmental motions is more prominent in the
amorphous region, thus it confirms the increased electrical conductivity42,43

3.9 AC Conductivity Study of Unirradiated and
Irradiated Film
The ac conductivity of unirradiated and irradiated
PHL10 polymer electrolyte films as a function of frequency is shown
in Figure 13. The
ac conductivity varies with frequency and temperature. The ac conductivity
observed increases slightly linearly with frequency due to its disorder
characteristic; there is no big change in the ac conductivity at a
critical frequency (up to 5 kHz). After the critical frequency, the
ac conductivity increases with frequency as it approaches the resonance
frequency of the charge carriers along the polymer chain. ac conductivity
is frequency independent at lower frequency due to the free charges
and frequency dependent due to the release of activated trapped charges
at higher frequency.22

Figure 13 Variation in ac conductivity
for unirradiated and irradiated PHL10
electrolyte films at different temperatures.

The ac conductivity (σac) was calculated
by the
equation 12  where d is the thickness
of the sample, A is the electrode area, ε0 is the dielectric permittivity in a vacuum (8.85 × 10–12 F/m), and ω is the angular frequency. The
ac conductivity values for both unirradiated and irradiated films
increases with irradiation dose and temperature, as shown in Figure 14, because the charge
carriers are easily transported by the hopping mechanism through the
defects created by radiation energy and freeing the dipoles present
in the polymer chain at high temperature, in agreement with the reported
results.39,44

Figure 14 Variation in σac with EB dose
at different frequencies
and constant temperature 383 K.

Figure 14 reveals
that the increase in ac conductivity with irradiation dose is attributed
to the degradation of the polymer chains due to the chain scissoning
resulting in reduced molecular weight at higher dosage. The low-molecular-weight
polymers with salts exhibit high conductivity as compared to high-molecular-weight
polymers because of reduction in the crystallinity with increased
amorphous content, as reported.10,39

3.10 DC Electrical Conductivity of Unirradiated
and Irradiated Film
The increase in dc conductivity of PHL10
polymer electrolyte film as a function of irradiation dose is shown
in Figure 15. The
long polymer chains break into small fragments when exposed to radiation,
resulting in the modifications of the polymer matrix. As the irradiation
dose increased, the polymer chain scission occurs, which provides
more flexibility to ions in the polymer matrix to move easily, in
turn, improving the conductivity.12,45

Figure 15 Variation
in dc conductivity and relaxation time as a function
of dose.

The dc conductivity of unirradiated
and irradiated PHL10 polymer
electrolyte films was calculated using the equation 13  where ε0 is the free space
permittivity, M∞ is the frequency
at which peak maximum occurs in M″, and τ
is the relaxation time. It is observed that the dc conductivity of
polymer electrolyte films was increased and relaxation time decreased
with increase in EB dose, as shown in Figure 15. It is found that the highest conductivity
of about 1.81 × 10–3 S/cm with 1.697 ×
10–6 relaxation time for 120 kGy EB dose and other
calculated values for different doses are given in Table 3. The decrease in crystallinity
in the XRD and DSC results are well correlated with this finding.

3.11 Current–Voltage of Unirradiated and
Irradiated Film
Figure 16 shows the I–V characteristics of unirradiated and irradiated PHL10 polymer electrolyte
films.

Figure 16 I–V characteristics of
PVDF-HFP, PHL10 unirradiated and irradiated polymer electrolyte films.

The current increases gradually
with the applied voltage, as increasing
the irradiation dose follows the Ohmic behavior; it means the current
varies linearly with voltage.38 The conductivity
is due to the presence of some conjugational and trapped ions in the
polymer chain as reported.46 The increase
in conductivity with increasing irradiation dose correlates well with
the dielectric and electric modulus results.

3.12 NMR
Spectroscopy
NMR spectrometer
is used to study the polymer chain structure and dynamics and the 13C NMR spectra of unirradiated and EB-irradiated PHL polymer
electrolyte at 40, 80, and 120 kGy dose, as shown in Figure 17, the line narrowing observed
in the 13C NMR spectra with increased irradiation dose
at room temperature is due to the intramolecular interactions.

Figure 17 13C NMR spectra of unirradiated and EB-irradiated PHL10
polymer electrolyte at 40, 80, and 120 kGy doses.

The 13C NMR spectra confirm the EB irradiation
effect
on the PHL10 polymer electrolyte by the changes reflected in the form
of sharpening and splitting of the spectral lines due to the intermolecular
interaction47 with increased EB dose and
exhibit new spectral lines at 162.80 ppm at 120 kGy EB dose. The NMR
spectra reveals that the shift in the signal peak at 43.27 ppm in
the unirradiated PHL polymer electrolyte to 43.51 ppm after 120 kGy
EB dose is attributed to the presence of carbon atoms and fluorinated
carbon atoms in the peak range 118–122 ppm, and the spectral
lines between 118 and 121 ppm are assigned to the CF2 group
of the host polymer. The NMR study confirms that relative change in
chemical bonds and radiation-induced changes in polymeric materials
due to irradiation results in degradation of the polymer electrolyte
upon irradiation,48 and the results are
in good agreement with FT-IR analysis.

3.13 Electrochemical
Performance
The
electrochemical performance of unirradiated and EB-irradiated PHL10
polymer electrolyte was studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) within
−3–1 V potential window in a three-electrode system
at room temperature. Pt wire is used as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl
as a reference electrode, and glassy carbon as a working electrode
placed in the polymer electrolyte solution prepared in dimethylformamide
(DMF) solvent. The C–V curves
of PHL10 polymer electrolyte before and after irradiation is presented
in Figure 18a and
that of EB-irradiated PHL10 at 120 kGy with 30, 60, and 90 mV/s scan
rates are given in Figure 18b.

Figure 18 Cyclic voltammetry curves of PHL10 polymer electrolyte
film: (a)
unirradiated, 40, 80, and 120 kGy EB dose and (b) 120 kGy EB dose
at different scan rates.

The unirradiated electrolyte reveals an ideal shape with
a less
integrated area under CV curves without a redox peak. After EB irradiation
to radiation, the area under the C–V curves increases significantly with a clear redox peak
at around −0.9 V and is increased with increase EB dose as
shown in Figure 18a, it represents the charge and discharge processes occur reversibly
at the electrolyte interface; is confirms the capacitive nature of
irradiated polymer electrolytes. Figure 18b represents the C–V curves of 120 kGy EB dose irradiated PHL10 polymer electrolyte
at 30, 60, and 90 mV/s scan rates. It reveals the increased redox
reaction process with increased scan rate, the oxidation and reduction
peak currents increase significantly.48−50 The results reveal that
the polymer electrolytes are electrochemically active after EB irradiation
and are active materials for potential storage and lithium-ion battery
applications.

4 Conclusions
The
PHL10 polymer electrolyte films were prepared by solution-casting
method and the effect of EB irradiation effect at 40, 80, and 120
kGy doses was studied. The change in the surface roughness was observed
after EB irradiation in PHL10 electrolyte film confirms the morphological
change due to the irradiation effect. FT-IR results confirmed the
effect of EB dose on the structural properties of the polymer electrolytes
by change in the peak intensity and shifting peak positions after
irradiation. The NMR study confirms the degradation and radiation-induced
changes in polymeric materials. The XRD analysis confirms the increased
amorphous phase by decreasing crystallinity upon the increased EB
dose and the decrease in the melting temperature of polymer electrolyte
confirms that the degradation of the polymer chain is resulted by
chain scission process upon irradiation. Thermal properties varied
with increased irradiation dose and the percentage of crystallinity
decreased from 49.87 for unirradiation to 33.05 after irradiation
with 120 kGy EB; the finding was confirmed by the DSC analysis. The
changes in dielectric parameters with increased EB irradiation dose
confirms the formation of cross-linked free radicals with applied
high EB dose. These results confirm that the physiochemical properties
of the polymer electrolytes can be changed by EB irradiation for possible
commercial applications. The increase in conductivity with increased
EB dose is attributed to the degradation of the polymer chains due
to the chain scission results in the reduced molecular weight at a
higher dosage and the PHL10 polymer electrolyte exhibits an electrical
conductivity 1.8 × 10–3 S/cm after irradiated
with 120 kGy EB dose. The C–V curves reveal that the PHL10 polymer electrolyte is electrochemically
active and exhibits capacitive behavior by redox reaction at different
scan rates upon irradiation. The observed results confirm the change
in physical properties of polymer electrolytes by EB irradiation at
different doses, and that irradiated polymeric materials may have
potential application in commercial applications as well as optoelectronic
devices and battery applications.

5 Experimental
Methods
5.1 Materials
Poly((vinylidene fluoride)-co-hexafluoropropylene) pellets (PVDF-HFP; Mw: 455 000 g/mol) and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4-Mw: 106.4 g/mol) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethylformamide (DMF, Mw: 73.09 g/mol) was from Merck, India.

5.2 Preparation
of PHL10 Electrolyte Film
The polymer electrolyte film was
prepared by solution-casting method.
The PVDF-HFP/LiClO4 (90:10 w/w, coded as PHL10) weight
ratios were dissolved separately in dimethylformamide (DMF–C3H7NO) solvent by stirring continuously for about
6–8 h at room temperature. The solutions were then mixed by
stirring continuously till a homogeneous viscous solution was obtained.
Then, the solution was cast onto a Petri dish and allowed to evaporate
and peel off the bulk free stand film. The thickness of the free standing
film, around 0.30–0.35 mm, was measured using a screw gauge.
The mechanism of the solution-casting process is shown in Scheme 1.
