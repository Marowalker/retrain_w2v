Attaining capability of label-free
optical characterization of
tissues will offer methodological advancement and possibilities for
early clinical detection, which is of paramount importance in treating
patients under clinical setups, for example, cancer. Here, we demonstrate
the potential of autofluorescence exhibited by tissues as an enabling
microscopic strategy to achieve high-resolution imagery data offering
a wealth of clinically relevant information including possibility
of three-dimensional rendering. Furthermore, we elucidate the use
of analytic tools to extract numerical read-outs from such data with
further implications in histopathology, pharmaceutics, toxicology,
and screening purposes. This study summarizes the results obtained
through a systematic autofluorescence-based investigation on murine
and porcine gut tissues with an example of applying the technique
in nanotoxicology. The study provides with a methodological roadmap
toward developing a fast, effective, and robust platform enabling
in-depth optical characterization of tissues.

1 Introduction
Acquiring
high-resolution images from tissue samples in light microscopy
remains a challenge. The opaque, dense, and granular matrix in tissue
blocks causes scattering of light and prevents adequate penetration
resulting in loss of useful structural, pathological, and clinically
relevant information.1 With significant
advancement in fluorescence microscopy, plenty of fluorophores, including
immunolabeling tools, have been developed offering opportunities to
tag and image various cellular and subcellular structures. However,
as reactive species, fluorophores induce physicochemical and molecular
alterations within tissues. Labeling protocols are often time-consuming
and require extensive tissue manipulation which is deleterious to
native tissue structure.2 Moreover, commercialized
labeling kits are expensive and require infrastructural support. As
a result, conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histopathology
slides continue to be popular in clinical diagnostics, despite extensive
tissue manipulation and paucity of data due to lack of three-dimensional
(3D) representation. Switching to label-free fluorescence microscopy
will thus offer an edge over existing labeling-derived or H&E
staining protocols on the merits of being less laborious, cost-effective,
minimal tissue manipulation, and, above all, providing 3D information.
Autofluorescence from tissues, as exemplified here, can be an interesting
strategy. It is known that various tissues (e.g., blood), tissue components
(e.g., elastin, collagen), or intracellular molecules (e.g., flavins,
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, amino acids such
as tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine) act as endogenous
fluorophores.3−9 Porphyrin, a digested blood-borne product present in processed tissues,
is particularly reported to exhibit excellent emission,10 which makes it an exciting tool to image tissues,
especially the ones rich in blood supply, for example, the gut. This
report provides further in-depth analysis on the utility of tissue
autofluorescence toward designing an effective tissue characterization
and histological platform. Although autofluorescence has been used
before to image isolated cells (e.g., leukocytes),11 its use in characterizing tissue is scarce.

2 Results and Discussion
Porcine and murine jejunal tissue
slides were prepared without
any staining by the standard protocol (Figure S1) and then visualized in an inverted microscope. Acquisition
under an identical setup (e.g., intensity, exposure time, image gain,
aperture size, etc.) provided comparability. Images with excellent
resolution were acquired from the tissue slides under blue (λex/em 470/525 nm) channel (Figure 1a) and reasonable signal was obtained under
UV (λex/em 357/445 nm), whereas no signal was received
in green (λex/em 560/630 nm) or red (λex/em 628/692 nm) channels. The overall texture of both porcine
and murine jejunal tissues was visible with high definition. Crisp
quality images enabled further zooming into specific substructures
[e.g., villi, red blood corpuscle (RBC), smooth muscles, and glands]
delving deeper into details such as lamina propria of villi (Figure 1b). The RBCs were
visible as biconcave discs and expectedly demonstrated intense emission
because of elevated levels of porphyrin due to high hemoglobin content.
The muscles showed lesser emission from structural proteins (elastin,
collagen). The intestinal crypts of Lieberkühn were clearly
visible and were studded with mucus-secreting goblet cells. 3D rendering
of intestinal villi from z-stacks (Video S2) enabled understanding of its internal fabric. Comparison
of images revealed higher autofluorescence from murine samples to
porcine ones (Figure 1c) because of species variation of hemoglobin and difference in tissue
composition. The fluorescence lifetime (τ) of muscles, glands,
and RBCs was assessed by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
(FLIM) (Figure 1d).

deviation (SD) (n = 20). The sharpness of porcine
images was adjusted for clarity.

Characterization of the gut tissue based on autofluorescence
offered
opportunity to extract numerical read-outs enabling toxicity investigation.
Here, we demonstrated an example of exposure scenario to CdSe quantum
dots (QDs) (λem = 620 ± 5 nm in red channel)
which are known to cause toxicity.12−16 Slices of murine jejunal tissue (∼1 cm thickness)
were placed on a glass slide forming small wells with the gut lumen
facing upward while 5 μL aliquots of QD-suspension (100 μg/mL)
in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)
buffer were deposited in the lumen (Figure 2a) to allow permeation. After an hour, tissue
slides were prepared from exposed slices and imaged in blue (detects
tissue autofluorescence and also QDs due to its broad excitation spectrum—Figure S3) and red channels (detects only QDs
as the tissue did not show autofluorescence in this channel). The
structural changes in villi due to the exposure could be identified
and the QDs seemed to cluster inside the tissue (Figure 2b) while also penetrated the
intestinal crypts (Figure 2c). Numerical data on intratissue distribution of QDs based
on the distance from the exposure site (luminal wall) could be developed
from a wider (4×) field (Figure 2d). This strategy can be used for quantification (from
area under curve) in transport studies with relevance in pharmaceutics.
The trabeculae of lamina propria from control and exposed jejunal
villi were compared after analysis by BoneJ plug-in based on the mean
branch length (Figure 2e,f), connectivity density (Figure 2g), trabecular thickness (Figure 2h), trabecular volume fraction, and surface
area (Figure 2i and Videos S4 + S5). Exposure
to QDs resulted in significant decrease in the mean branch length,
connectivity density, trabecular thickness, and volume fraction of
tissue mass within trabecular network of lamina propria.

wide absorbance spectra of QDs. The red channel showed only the QDs
inside tissues as no tissue autofluorescence was detected in the red
channel. The red arrows point toward clusters of QDs inside tissue.

different (p < 0.05) to control were marked with
an asterisk (*).

3 Conclusions
Although autofluorescence is often cited as the source of interference
or background noise in experimental data, it also offers unprecedented
opportunities for high-resolution label-free imaging of tissue with
projected applications in transport studies, histopathology on biopsy
material, drug development, toxicology, and screening. Furthermore,
the presence of such autofluorescence is not limited to the gut and
also observed in other tissues. The endogenous fluorophores are highly
sensitive molecules capable of detecting minute chemical changes in
their surroundings. For example, fluorescence lifetime (τ) is
a highly sensitive concentration-independent parameter17 and thus can be used to spot pathology in the
gut, for example, neoplastic (cancerous lesions, ulceration, and polyps),
inflammatory (colitis), hemoglobinopathies, or structural defects
in RBCs at early stages. Tissue handling is crucial to achieve high-quality,
consistent, and comparable data. Hence, the protocol for preparing
tissue slides should be uniform. In this study, structural analysis
of villi including trabecular network of lamina propria was performed
to assess toxicity. This can be useful for diagnostics in relation
to various clinical conditions, for example, villous atrophy found
in celiac,18 Whipple,19 and Crohn’s20 disease
or toxicity from oral exposure. Moreover, advancement in light-emitting
diode (LED) technology has now enabled cheap, long-lasting, portable,
and energy-efficient light sources compatible with simpler microscopic
platforms. Availability of freeware tools and automated microscopic
platforms hold additional possibilities for multiplexing, array-based
analysis, microfluidics, and high-content screening.

4 Materials & Methods
4.1 Quantum Dots
CdSe
QDs (6.2–7.7
nm), absorption 620 nm, emission 640 nm (Lumidot, product no. 662461,
Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased (5 mg/mL in toluene). Stock dispersions
(1 mg/mL) were made with dilution in ethanol, whereas working dispersions
(100 μg/mL) were prepared by further dilution in HEPES buffer
(product no. 83264, Sigma-Aldrich). The excitation and emission spectrums
of 100 μg/mL dispersion of the QDs were measured in a spectrofluorometer
(Figure S3).

4.2 Jejunal
Tissues and Preparation of Tissue
Slides
Both murine (male Wistar rats, age 8–10 weeks,
wt 250–350 g) and porcine jejunum were acquired from other
groups in UCD (refinement of the 3Rs—Replacement, Reduction,
and Refinement). The jejunal tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin
and the paraffin blocks were prepared after processing with repeated
cycles of alcoholic dehydration and clearing with xylene. Microtomed
tissue sections (5 μm thickness) were removed from paraffin
and mounted on glass slides with thin coverslips using DPX mounting
medium.

4.3 Exposure Scenario
Thin cross-sectional
slices (∼1 cm thickness) from murine jejunum were dissected
and deposited on a glass slide with creation of a well, where circular
tissue formed the rim and lumen faced upward (Figure 2a). Five microliter aliquots of QD-dispersion
(100 μg/mL) were then deposited in the lumen and left for an
hour, followed by thorough washing of the tissue in water and preparation
of slides as described above.

4.4 Microscopy
Tissue slides were examined
(4×, 10×, 20×, 40×) in an inverted Zeiss AxioVision
microscope with LED light source under four channels: UV (λex/em 357/445 nm), blue (λex/em 470/525 nm),
green (λex/em 560/630 nm), and red (λex/em 628/692 nm). Images were stored as .zvi files for further analysis.
FLIM was performed with a 10× objective in an inverted LIFA microscope
(Lambert Instruments, Netherlands) with modulated light source under
the frequency domain. The data were stored as .fli files, and the
τ (phase) for different structures (villi, muscle, crypts, and
RBC) was determined by selecting multiple (n = 20)
region of interests using fluorescein as the reference (τ =
4 ns). The data were then exported as excel files.

4.5 Imagery Analysis
All imagery data
(.zvi file format) were analyzed using FIJI software after proper
scaling. To compare the emission intensities between murine and porcine
samples, the mean gray values were obtained (analyze → set
measurements → select mean gray value and integrated density
→ measure) from 20 images (n = 20) and data
were stored as .csv file for further statistical analysis. An arrow
is drawn and then the distribution pattern was generated by using
analyze → plot profile tool and numerical data were saved as
excel sheet. For BoneJ analysis, cropped images of villous lamina
propria were first binarized (process → binary → make
binary) followed by skeletonizing and further purification/cleaning
of data (plugins → BoneJ → skeletonise 3D → purify).
The obtained data were then analyzed by analyze skeleton tool by selecting
prune cycle method: none (plugins → BoneJ → analyze
skeleton). The numerical data on mean branch length along with color-coded
images for branching were obtained. The connective density (μm–3) was determined using the connectivity tool (plugins → BoneJ → connectivity). The trabecular
analysis on villous lamina propria was done using the thickness tool
(plugins → BoneJ → thickness) to obtain data on trabecular
thickness with SD. All data were exported as excel files for further
analysis.

4.6 Statistics
The data (n = 20) were analyzed using OriginPro 2015 (OriginLab) software and
plotted as mean ± SD. Data points significantly different (p < 0.05) to control tissue (while assessing toxicity
caused by QDs) or to murine RBCs (while comparing emission intensities
between various murine and porcine villi, crypts, RBCs, and muscles)
were marked with an asterisk (*).
