Tuning
optical limiting was achieved based on the nanostructural
and synergistic effects of heterosized gold nanoparticles and fullerene
on electrochemical assembly. In particular, with thicknesses of 200,
1, and 10 nm, heterosized AuNP multilayers with periodical pairs of
layers present a superior threshold of 0.59 J cm–2 to monosized AuNP films with the values of 0.89–2.55 J cm–2, which was further significantly enhanced by the
introduction of C70 with a significant threshold drop from
0.43 to 0.13 J cm–2, indicating that the reverse
saturable absorption of C70 had a key contribution compared
to the free carrier absorption of AuNPs. This paper not only demonstrates
that the hybrid engineering of heterosized AuNPs into an identical
film is an effective way to enhance the optical limiting but also
indicates that the reverse saturable absorption of C70 is
superior to free carrier absorption of AuNPs in optical limiting in
AuNPs and C70 hybrid films.

Introduction
Optical limiting materials
and processes have been widely studied
to minimize the pathological effect on the eyes and damage of optical
sensors.1−3 Highly dispersed nano-objects in covalently thin
film usually have a conflict between high loading and good transparency
in practical applications. In this case, the investigation of nanostructural
size and the synergistic effect of various materials with different
optical limiting mechanisms becomes a significant step toward the
development of practical components and devices.4−6 However, the
integration of multiscale and multicomponent materials into an identical
film generally has serious problems with compatibility and film-forming
for use of both small molecules and nano-objects. As one of the most
successful methods, electrostatic assembly7,8 (Supporting Information)9 can lead to low loading weight percent of nano-objects10 and low energy transfer efficiency.11 In the past decade, we have developed electrochemically
covalent assembly12−16 for high loading integrations of multiscale and multicomponent building
blocks with versatile function and distribution controllability. In
this paper, with C–C coupling reactions of carbazoles and pyrenes,17 gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and C70 with distinct optical limiting mechanisms of free carrier absorption
(FCA)18 and reverse saturable absorption
(RSA),19 respectively, were electrochemically
integrated into an identical film for understanding of the nanostructural
size and synergistic effects of gold nanoparticles and fullerene on
optical limiting.

Results and Discussion
Well-dispersed
AuNPs with diameters of 1, 5, and 10 nm were chemically
synthesized (Figure S1) and utilized owing
to high conductivity20 and good stability21 during electrochemical fabrication. Electrochemical
assemblies of heterosized AuNPs and fullerene were triggered through
C–C couplings of carbazoles, and pyrenes are illustrated in Scheme 1. Insoluble layers
were prepared electrochemically and enabled us to fabricate a further
layer on the upper surface from alternative solutions as well as layer-by-layer
assembly.

Scheme 1 Heterosized AuNPs and C70 Hybrid Films
Fabricated through
Electrochemical C–C Couplings of Carbazoles and Pyrenes
The redox peaks are mostly
contributed by 3,3′-bicarbazoles
as shown in Figure 1A–C.12 Thus, rising current intensities
of redox peaks with number of cyclic voltammetry (CV) imply the successful
accumulating processes of 3,3′-bicarbazoles; in other words,
the growing processes of AuNP films indicate that the thickness of
the films can be controlled by number of CV cycles on indium tin oxide
(ITO) in CH2Cl2 solution. As the potential sweeps,
the current intensity of 1 nm AuNP film grows faster in less cycles
compared to those of 5 and 10 nm AuNPs owing to fast immigration of
small size from the bulk solution onto the electrode surface. Therefore,
1, 5, and 10 nm AuNP films with an identical thickness of 200 nm (Figure S2) were fabricated using 10, 20, and
50 cycles, respectively. Compared to well-known electrostatic assembly,
this electrochemical assembly can automatically repair the defect
of morphology because the defect area should have high current density
for fast deposition of AuNPs. The roughness of the morphology surface
(RMS) of 1, 5, and 10 nm AuNP films is 5, 11, and 19 nm, respectively,
indicating that the electrochemical manipulation of small size AuNPs
is easily controlled (Figure S3). As shown
in Figure 1G–I,
the absorption intensities at 300–350 nm corresponding to carbazole
and 3,3′-bicarbazole22 are obviously
stronger than the featured plasma peaks of 1, 5, and 10 nm AuNPs in
both solution and film states. In the film state, several tiny absorption
peaks of carbazoyls disappear and gather together as a broad peak
because of the structural formation transformation from carbazole
to 3,3′-bicarbazole. All AuNP films show a broad absorption
peak at the long-wavelength region probably owing to the enhanced
localized surface plasmon resonance from the solution to the solid
state,23 where individual AuNPs exist as
shown in Figure 2.
For the TEM observation of the inner nanostructure with AuNP films,
prespin-coated water-soluble conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–polystyrenesulfonate
(PEDOT–PSS) on the ITO electrode before electrochemical assembly
can enable the resulting AuNP films to be taken off from the ITO electrode
during solvent rinsing for further characterization. As shown in Figure 1G–I, AuNP
domains with sizes of 10 and 20–50 nm can be observed from
the respective 1 and 5 nm AuNP films, while the size of 10 nm AuNPs
remains similar before and after electrochemical assembly. In order
to question that these aggregation states of AuNPs appeared before
or after electrochemical assembly, AuNPs with electrolyte before and
after electrochemical assembly were observed under TEM. The supporting
electrolyte on the grid was removed by rinsing carefully with ethanol
before or after electrochemical assembly. TEM images in Figure 2A-1, B-1, and C-1 show that
they can keep initial sizes and dispersibilities before electrochemical
assembly (Figure S1). The aggregation states
of AuNPs appear after electrochemical assembly of <10 min. In particular,
the diameter of 1 nm AuNPs transformed to ∼10 nm (Figure 2A-2); the diameter
of 5 nm AuNPs transformed to domains with the size distribution from
20 to 50 nm (Figure 2B-2); and the size of 10 nm AuNPs remains similar to its initial
state (Figures 2C-2
and S1). HRTEM images indicate that all
aggregation states of AuNPs are composed of closely packed and monodispersed
AuNPs with their original sizes (Figure 2D-3, E-3, F-3). Similarly, HRTEM images of
AuNP films after electrochemical assembly present the same situation
as HRTEM images of electrolyte solutions (Figure 2D-4, E-4, F-4). Therefore, all AuNPs have
the stable morphology without size change before and after electrochemical
assembly.

No obvious crystallinity of AuNP films on ITO and FTO (fluorine-doped
tin oxide) was observed due to the serious interference of the strong
crystallinity of ITO and FTO (Figure S4). Alternatively, AuNP composites prepared by chemical C(3)–C(3′)
coupling of carbazole with FeCl3 as oxidizing oxidant have
similar inner structures with electrochemically aggregated states
of AuNPs (Figure 3A-C
and 1G-I). Interestingly, the ratios of diffraction
peaks {111} to {220} obviously increase after chemical assembly from
1.32, 2.14, and 2.09 to 3.29, 2.59, and 2.42, respectively (Figure 4D–F). Therefore,
the polymeric AuNPs could have a preferential growth direction along
the Au{111} plane, implying that the electrochemical assembly can
reprogram the orientation of AuNPs probably according to more coupling
reactions on Au{111} as the preponderant face.

AuNPs. Absorption spectra (B), TEM (B), and AFM (C) images of multilayers.
(D) Optical limiting of monosized AuNP films and heterosized AuNP
trilayer film.

A heterosized AuNP trilayer
with thickness of 200 nm was assembled
in the order of 10 nm (20 cycles), 5 nm (10 cycles), and 1 nm (6 cycles)
AuNPs (Figure S5A-B), absorption spectra,
and morphology observations as shown in Figure 4A–C. This trilayer presents an optical
limiting threshold of 0.69 J cm–2, which is mostly
contributed by free carrier absorption.18 Comparably, 10 and 1 nm monosized AuNP films with the same thickness
of 200 nm show the optical limiting thresholds of 1.2 J cm–2 and 0.89 J cm–2 (Figure 4D), respectively, and the values were usually
obtained from NP/glass with a thickness of several millimeters,24,25 implying that this electrochemical assembly could fabricate the
film with better transparency. A 5 nm AuNP film exhibited very weak
optical limiting in good agreement with previous studies.26 The heterosized AuNP multilayer gives superior
optical limiting to monosized AuNPs, probably due to better energy
transfer and restrained carrier recombination in heterosized AuNP
nanostructure.

Due to the small optical limiting of 5 nm AuNP
film, 1 nm (8 cycles)
and 10 nm (25 cycles) heterosized AuNP bilayer film with thickness
of 200 nm (Figure S8B) was fabricated,
and this bilayer provides a similar threshold of 0.69 J cm–2 (Figure 5A) to the
heterosized AuNP trilayer (Figure 4D), indicating that the 5 nm AuNP layer does not have
an obvious contribution to optical liming. In order to enhance the
interaction between pairs of 1 and 10 nm layers, the heterosized AuNP
films with multiperiodic bilayer nanostructure (Figure S11) were fabricated, and these films show a significant
threshold drop of 0.11 J cm–2 from 0.69 J cm–2 to 0.58 J cm–2 (Figure 5A–C). The heterosized
AuNP multilayer with 10 periodical bilayers and thickness of 300 nm
did not show an obvious enhancement in optical limiting (Figure S14), probably due to the difficult manipulation
of 10 nm AuNPs, while the thickness of the multilayer increases (Figure S15). Furthermore, 10 nm AuNPs were replaced
by C70-pyrene for fabrication of 200 nm hybrid films by
electrochemical alternative assembly of 1 nm AuNPs and C70, and their thresholds are 0.26–0.33 J cm–2 with different layered nanostructures (Figure 5D, Figure S19).
Additionally, all AuNP films were tested in the reverse position,
in which the laser first reached ITO and then crossed through the
AuNP multilayer film. The AuNP sequence does not affect the optical
limiting comparison of these films (Figure S9), and ITO-coated glass can be negligible (Figure S10).

Figure 5 Optical limiting at 532 nm of 10 and 1 nm heterosized
AuNPs film
on ITO with differently periodic bilayer structures of 1 (A), 5 (B)
and 10 (C); Thresholds of varied AuNPs and AuNPs/C70 hybrid
films with same thickness of 200 nm (D).

In order to accelerate the time of film fabrication, electrochemical
copolymerization was also utilized to fabricate 1 nm AuNP/C70 hybrid film with different ratio of AuNPs/C70 to tune
the energy transfer and optical limiting. As the ratio of C70 increases, these hybrid films show better thresholds from 0.43 to
0.13 J cm–2 (Figure 5D, Figure S20), which are
unfortunately higher than 0.063 J cm–2 of single
component C70 film,15 indicating
that reverse saturable absorption of C70 has a significant
contribution compared to free carrier absorption of AuNPs in these
hybrid films.

If redox peaks between −0.5 and 1.05 V
were supposed to
be relative to the one-electron redox process of 3,3′-bicarbazolyls,22 the number of AuNPs in the film can be calculated
as shown in Figure 1D–F according to the formula in Table 1, based on the carbazole coverage (Γbi-Cz) on the AuNP surface that 1 nm AuNPs bear 18 thiol
ligands.27 The numbers of heterosized AuNPs
in identical multilayers are calculated as shown in Table 1, which enables us to possibly
control each component of heterosized AuNPs by CVs in alternative
solutions (Figure 1D–F) for precisely tuning optical limiting. In Table 1, the values (a) have similar
order of magnitude with values (b) obtained based on a previous method28 if there was the same amount of carbazole per
unit area for all AuNPs, indicating that this calculation is a reasonable
and simple method for quantitatively controlled optical limiting of
heterosized AuNP film.

c Based on the formula N(thiol/AuNP) = AAuNP/0.212, 0.212 was the footprint of one thiolate
on the AuNP surface. All
AuNPs were spherical with density of 19.3 g cm–3.

In summary, the heterosized
AuNP films and their hybrid films with
fullerene were successfully fabricated by countable electrochemical
assembly with distribution controllability and individually stable
state of AuNPs. The periodic bilayer structures of heterosized AuNPs
instead of monosized AuNPs were found to significantly enhance optical
limiting. A study on the hybrid films of AuNPs and C70 demonstrated
that the reverse saturable absorption of C70 has the main
contribution compared to free carrier absorption of AuNPs. Therefore,
the hybrid nanostructures based on the reverse saturable absorption
could be a great potential strategy for optical limiting films with
high performance by programmable electrochemical fabrication.

Experimental
Section
Materials and reagents were purchased from Aldrich,
Aladdin, Adamas,
and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. and used without further purification.
Solvents for chemical synthesis and electrochemistry were purified
by distillation.

1H NMR spectra were obtained at
298 K using a Bruker
Avance 300 NMR spectrometer. MALDI-TOF MS were obtained using a Bruker
Daltonics Autoflex III TOF/TOF. TEM images were obtained using a JEOL-JEM2100
operating at 200 kV. The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer at room temperature. FT-IR
spectra were recorded on an IR Tracer-100 at room temperature. AFM
of electropolymeration films was studied by the SPI 3800N Probe Station,
Seiko Instruments Inc. (Japan) in room temperature air. XRD measurements
were performed on a D8 Focus. Optical limiting was measured using
the Nd:YAG laser with interval of 10 ns at 532 nm. Profilometer analysis
was performed on Alphastep D-100.

For electrochemical experiments,
the supporting electrolyte TBAPF6 (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate)
was dried for 24
h at 80 °C under vacuum before use. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was
performed using a typical one-compartment, three-electrode electrochemical
cell driven by a CHI model 660E electrochemical analyzer. Ag/AgNO3 (E1/2 = 0.26 V vs Fc/Fc+) was used as a reference. Indium tin oxide (ITO) (8–12 Ω/□,
Aldrich) (deposition area: ∼1.0 cm2) was used as
the working electrode, and the counter electrode was a gold foil (area:
∼2.0 cm2). After electrochemical assembly, the resulting
films were rinsed with CH2Cl2 to remove any
unreactive precursors.
