One of the structural factors controlling
the extent of interactions
between ionic liquids (ILs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
in IL/MOF composites is elucidated. Results showed that the thermal
stability limits and adsorption performances of the IL/MOF composites
can be tuned by the interionic interaction energy of bulk ILs, which

1 Introduction
Incorporation
of ionic liquids (ILs) in metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) offers a broad potential in the way of improving the performance
of the parent MOF material in various applications including catalysis,1,2 ionic conductivity,3 gas storage,4 and gas separation.5 Among these applications, the outcomes in gas storage and gas separation
are especially promising. Here, the key point is that ILs have tunable
physicochemical properties, presenting opportunities for adjusting
the characteristics of the available adsorption sites in MOFs.6,7 Moreover, the presence of an IL molecule inside the MOF cages also
offers possibilities of regulating the available pore space for the
gas adsorption. Consequently, gas storage and gas separation performance
of the parent MOF can be tuned by the proper choice of IL/MOF pairs.
For instance, we recently incorporated 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate [BMIM][BF4] into CuBTC, HKUST-1 (Cu3(BTC)2; BTC= benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate).8 High-pressure volumetric uptake measurements
illustrated that the incorporation of [BMIM][BF4] increases
CH4 selectivity over CO2, H2, and
N2 by more than 1.5 times in comparison with their corresponding
values in pristine CuBTC.6

Similarly,
incorporation of another IL, 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate [BMIM][PF6], into another MOF, zeolitic
imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), led to a more significant increase
in gas separation performance.7 Results
showed that CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivities increased from 2.2 and 6.5 to 8.9 and 24, respectively,
upon IL incorporation. Detailed characterization of the structures
complemented by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated
that there are strong interactions between the IL molecules and the
host MOF. These results combined with the molecular simulations of
gas adsorption in the IL/MOF composite showed that IL–MOF interactions
are responsible for the improved gas separation performance. Similarly,
incorporation of [BMIM][BF4] into ZIF-8 led to an increase
in CO2/CH4 selectivity from 2.2 to 4 and to
the doubling of CO2/N2 selectivity from 6.5
to 13.2.9

These changes in gas adsorption
and gas separation performances
upon IL incorporation are directly controlled by the interactions
between IL and MOF.7,9 Dhumal et al.10 confined [EMIM][EtSO4] into CuBTC and investigated
the interactions by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
complemented with DFT calculations. They showed that interactions
have a significant effect on the structure of the MOF as well as on
the IL. Accordingly, IL preferentially interacts with Cu ions, and
this interaction weakens the Cu–O bonding. Besides these studies,
computational efforts have been investigating the IL/MOF composites.
Vicent-Luna et al.11 focused on five different
ILs with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium [EMIM]+ cation and
performed molecular simulations to evaluate the effect of the IL incorporation
in a MOF, CuBTC, on the CO2 separation performance. They
illustrated an enhancement in the CO2 adsorption at lower
pressures compared to pristine CuBTC. Li et al.5 also performed molecular simulations to study the IL/Cu-TDPAT
composites for H2S/CH4 separation. The ILs consisted
of an identical cation, 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
[BMIM]+, and different anions ([Cl]−,
[Tf2N]−, [PF6]−, and [BF4]−). They showed that incorporation
of ILs could increase the H2S adsorption compared to pristine
MOF.

All of these studies illustrate that combining different
ILs with
different MOFs leads to composite materials with various gas adsorption
and separation performances. The research on applications of IL/MOF
composites is rapidly growing.12−15 One of the main challenges is that this field is
too new and the rationale behind the proper choice of ILs and MOFs
has not been fully understood yet. This fundamental information is
crucial for the rational design of such materials. This is why there
is a strong need for elucidating the structural factors controlling
the interactions in IL/MOF composites and their consequences on the
gas storage and gas separation performance. In the way of contributing
to overcome this challenge, here, we communicate a structural factor
in ILs, which we identified to have a strong influence not only on
the gas storage performances but also on the thermal stability limits
of IL/MOF composites.

When an IL is incorporated into the pores
of MOFs, it interacts
with the framework. This interaction can be physical and/or chemical
based on the type of the IL and MOF. If the cation of the IL is fixed
and the anion is changed, the cohesion energy between the cation and
the anion can be systematically varied. As the cohesion energy between
the ion moieties changes, the strength of hydrogen bond between the
ions will vary. As a result of these changes in the strength of the
hydrogen bond, the “interionic interaction energy” between
the cation and the anion is modified. According to the previous studies
in the literature, the strength of the interionic interaction energy
between the cation and the anion can be probed by the stretching infrared
(IR) frequency of the most acidic proton site on the imidazolium
cation (C2H, where C2 is the carbon between two N sites in the ring).16−24 Motivated from this point, we examined the consequences of the changes
in interionic interaction energy in bulk ILs on the thermal stability
limits and gas adsorption performances of IL/MOF composites. For this
purpose, we started with CuBTC, one of the most widely studied MOFs
for IL incorporation as reviewed above. It has open metal sites that
directly participate in gas adsorption process. Thus, we expected
to observe a direct influence of the IL molecules on these sites when
they are inside the pores. The ILs considered here were chosen from
a family of ILs with the same cation, [BMIM]+, having different
anions: bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [NTf2]−, methylsulfate [MeSO4]−, hexafluoroantimonate
[SbF6]−, thiocyanate [SCN]−, trifluoromethanesulfonate [CF3SO3]−, methanesulfonate [MeSO3]−, and octylsulfate
[OcSO4]−. Because these ILs have the
same cation, their interionic interaction strengths can be probed
and quantified by the corresponding ν(C2H) band position.

2 Results and Discussion
Wet impregnation method was
used for synthesizing the IL/MOF composites
with approximately 30 wt % stoichiometric IL loading.6,7,9 The resulting structures were
fully characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area analysis, Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size
and volume analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as reported
previously.6,7,9 From the BET
measurements, we observed that the pore volume, and the BET surface
area decreased in each IL/MOF sample as compared to pristine CuBTC
(Table S1, Supporting Information (SI)).
This decrease indicates the presence of ILs inside the MOF, consistent
with our previous reports.6,7,9 However, we note that the BET measurements are based on the N2 adsorption, which can be directly influenced by the presence
of IL inside the MOF cages. Because N2 might be dissolved
in different ILs at different levels, these BET results might be misleading
in terms of providing the quantitative results. For instance, the
IL loading calculations based on the change in the pore volumes upon
IL incorporation fail to estimate the loadings. For instance, the
estimated values for some of the samples were even higher than the
stoichiometric amounts of individual components used in the synthesis
(Table S1, SI). Thus, the IL loadings in
each sample were determined by XRF, as listed in Table S1, SI. The XRD results and the SEM analysis, given
in Figures S1 and S2, SI, confirmed that
the crystal structure and the morphology of the CuBTC were preserved
upon IL incorporation. Consistent with these results, the FTIR measurements
(Figures S3–S9) also indicate that
the IL and MOF structure remain intact with slight changes in the
positions and intensities of some of the IR features. These changes
were inferred to be related to the interactions between the IL molecules
and the CuBTC.6,7,9 Because
the IL is expected to interact directly with the unsaturated Cu sites,25,26 we focused on a band at 480 cm–1 associated with
(Cu–O) stretching frequency, ν(Cu–O). This band
provides information regarding the electronic environment over the
Cu sites, which should be influenced strongly by the presence of interactions
between the IL and MOF. Thus, the ν(Cu–O) band position
was used as a probe to quantify these interactions. For instance,
when the IL was [BMIM][SCN], this band presented a red shift of approximately
9 cm–1. This red shift indicated a weakening in
the Cu–O bond probably because of the electron sharing between
the unsaturated Cu atoms and the IL, leading to a decrease in the
electron density on the Cu sites to be shared with the framework oxygen
atoms. This result is consistent with those of Dhumal et al.,10 who showed a decrease in the Cu–O bond
strength as a result of interactions between IL and CuBTC.

As
stated above, the ILs selected for this study have the same
cation, [BMIM]+. The proton attached to the C2 position
between the two nitrogen atoms of the imidazolium ring in [BMIM]+ is the most acidic proton, which is responsible for strong
directional and localized hydrogen bonding between the cation and
anion of the IL. Therefore, its stretching frequency, ν(C2H),
can be used as a measure of interionic interaction energy in ILs.16−24 Accordingly, the interionic interaction energy becomes stronger
with a red shift in ν(C2H).16,17,22,24 Thus, we evaluated
the variations in ν(Cu–O) in IL/MOF composites with ν(C2H)
band position of the corresponding IL to elucidate the dependency
of the electronic and bonding environment of the open metal sites
in CuBTC on the interionic interaction energy in ILs.

Figure 1 illustrates
that there is a correlation (R2 = 0.73)
between the amount of red shift observed on ν(Cu–O) band
position and ν(C2H) of ILs. Accordingly, the magnitude of red
shift on ν(Cu–O) increases as the interionic interaction
energy in ILs increases (with a decrease in ν(C2H)). Thus, we
infer that the Cu–O bonding in the IL/MOF samples becomes weaker
in the presence of IL. On the basis of the results presented in Figure 1, we infer that the
degree of this weakening in Cu–O bonding is the highest when
the interionic interaction is the strongest. This behavior originates
from the fact that the increase in interionic interactions in ILs
is associated with an increase in the ionic character of the ions.
This stronger ionic character enables ILs to interact more strongly
with the unsaturated Cu sites, leading to a weakening in Cu–O
bonding (as evidenced by a red shift in ν(Cu–O)). Thus,
we infer that the interionic interaction energy in ILs is an important
structural parameter controlling the electronic environment over the
gas adsorption sites in CuBTC. We note that among all the ILs considered
here, only [BMIM][OcSO4] does not represent a good fit
in Figure 1 (with a
red shift in ν(Cu–O) and ν(C2H) values of 4.6 cm–1 and 3107 cm–1, respectively). This
IL has a significantly large anion compared to others we considered
in this work.27 Thus, the size of the anion
should be another structural parameter that plays a role in sterically
constraining the interactions between the IL and the open metal sites
of the MOF. When excluding this specific IL from the fit presented
in Figure 1, the correlation
coefficient increases from 0.73 to 0.95, presenting a very strong
correlation.

Figure 1 Correlation between ν(C2H) of bulk ILs and Cu–O
red
shifts in IL/MOF samples.

These results suggest that one can tune the electronic environment
over the open metal sites by changing the IL structure. As illustrated
previously,7,28 it is also possible to adjust
the available pore size and shape of the MOFs by the type and loading
of IL. This ability offers a broad potential to control the performance
of IL/MOF composites for various applications, such as gas adsorption,4 membrane-based gas separation,29 catalysis,1,2 and ionic conductivity.3 Because for these applications, the open metal
sites are the sites for adsorption, their electronic environment directly
determines the performance in the related application. In any of these
applications, one of the key points is that the structure of the composite
should remain intact under application conditions. Thus, we investigated
the consequences of changes in interionic interaction energy in ILs
on the thermal stability limits of these composites. Figure 2 illustrates the variation
in T′onset of IL/MOF composites,
indicating the temperature at which the thermal decomposition starts,
with ν(C2H) band position of the corresponding IL.

Figure 2 Correlation
between T′onset of
IL/MOF composites (left y axis) and ν(C2H)
of bulk ILs. The vertical axis on the right shows the correlation
between the corresponding red shift in ν(Cu–O) and ν(C2H)
of bulk ILs.

Accordingly, the thermal
stability limits of IL/MOF composites
decrease linearly with an increase in the interionic interaction energy
(probed by a decrease in ν(C2H)) associated with an increase
in the degree of red shift in ν(Cu–O). This strong correlation
indicates that the interactions between the IL and open Cu sites are
the dominant factors in determining the decomposition mechanism of
the composite. Moreover, the correlation presented in Figure 2 can perfectly predict the
decomposition temperature of an analogous [BMIM][BF4]/CuBTC
composite (with a corresponding ν(C2H) value of 3124 cm–1 for [BMIM][BF4]9) within a few degrees, confirming the validity of this correlation.6 Thus, we infer that the interionic interaction
energy of the ILs has a strong influence on the characteristics of
the IL/MOF composites. When it is higher, the IL interacts with the
Cu sites more strongly. This change lowers the stability limit, suggesting
that interactions between IL–MOF play a major role in thermal
decomposition.

Aiming at elucidating the corresponding influence
on gas storage
performance of the composites, we performed high-pressure volumetric
gas uptake measurements for CO2 and CH4. Here,
we note that the gas uptake values were normalized per gram of CuBTC
because our ultimate aim is to show how the presence of ILs influences
the gas uptake performance of the MOF. In other words, IL-incorporated
MOFs can be considered as functionalized MOFs and we aimed to directly
compare the amount of gas being adsorbed by the functionalized material
containing the same amount of MOF. Figure 3a illustrates the variation in CO2 uptake in IL/CuBTC samples with an increase in ν(C2H) of the
IL at 1 bar. Data show that the CO2 uptake decreases with
an increase in interionic interaction energy in ILs (with a decrease
in ν(C2H)). As the open metal sites in CuBTC interact more strongly
with the anion of the IL, they become less available for gas adsorption
(as evidenced from a weakening of the Cu–O bond). Confirming
this inference, Figure 3b illustrates a similar trend for CH4 uptake with even
a higher degree of correlation. This result also suggests that these
correlations strongly depend on the pressure.

Figure 3 Correlation between CH4 and CO2 uptakes vs
ν(C2H) of bulk ILs: (a) CO2 uptake at 1 bar; (b)
CH4 uptake at 1 bar; (c) correlation coefficients for CO2 uptake and CH4 uptake at different pressures (a
line was added between the points to guide the eye); (d) slope for
correlations between ν(C2H) and gas uptakes.

Figure 3c shows
the R2 values of these correlations as
a function of pressure. Accordingly, the R2 value for CH4 is as low as 0.63 at very low pressure
region because of the weak interactions of CH4 molecules
with the open metal sites at very low pressures. However, it quickly
increases to values higher than 0.9 with increasing pressure. CO2, on the other hand, has quadrupole moments facilitating efficient
interactions with the MOF at the very low pressure region.30 Thus, its R2 starts
from a value above 0.8 at very low pressures and gradually decreases
with increasing pressure. We note that at high pressures, the available
pore space is the dominant factor for gas adsorption, as evidenced
by a decrease in R2 with increasing pressure.
Moreover, Figure 3d
represents the change in slope of correlations between the corresponding
gas uptakes in IL/MOF composites and ν(C2H) of the ILs. Data
show that the slope for the correlation of CO2 uptake with
ν(C2H) is always higher than that of CH4 uptake.
Thus, we infer that the interionic interaction energy in ILs plays
a dominant role in controlling the CO2 uptake; however,
it is not that effective for controlling CH4 uptake, especially
at low pressures. Similar to the case with the decomposition temperature,
CH4 and CO2 uptakes for a previously reported
analogous [BMIM][BF4]/CuBTC composite6 can be estimated within less than ±5% error from the
correlations presented in Figure 3, confirming their validity.

3 Conclusions
Results presented here illustrate that the interionic interaction
energy in ILs is a major contributor in determining the interactions
of ILs with MOFs. These interactions directly control the electronic
environment over the unsaturated metal sites, which act as the gas
adsorption sites in CuBTC. Results also illustrated that these interactions
play a major role in determining the thermal stability limits and
the gas storage performance. The fundamental understanding presented
here can be extended to other IL and MOF combinations to fully elucidate
the structure–interactions–performance relationships
in IL/MOF composites. This information will be a guide in the rational
design of these composite materials with exceptional performance for
any desired application. Existence of many possible IL structures
provides tunable physical and chemical properties. Combining them
with a large number of different MOFs with various chemistry and topology
offers a broad potential.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Sample Preparation
CuBTC (Basolite C300),
ILs, and acetone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All of the materials were stored in an Ar-filled glovebox (Labconco).
ILs were dried at 353 K for 6 h and kept under vacuum for 12 h before
transferring it in to the glovebox. At first, CuBTC was dried overnight
in a vacuum oven at 105 °C. IL-incorporated samples were prepared
using acetone as solvent. Each IL (300 mg) was first dissolved in
20 mL acetone and stirred at room temperature for 1 h, followed by
the addition of 700 mg freshly dried CuBTC. The resulting samples
were stirred for 6 h at 35 °C until acetone had almost evaporated.
The samples were dried in an oven at 105 °C overnight.6

4.2 Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Spectroscopy
A Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 model
FTIR spectrometer with an
attenuated total reflection cell was used to collect the IR spectra
of bulk ILs and incorporated samples. Five hundred and twelve scans
with 2 cm–1 resolution were collected and averaged
at room temperature. Before each measurement, 128 background scans
were collected and averaged. Peak analyses and deconvolutions were
performed using Fityk software.31

4.3 X-ray Diffraction
A Bruker D8 Phaser
instrument with an X-ray generator performance of 30 kV of voltage
and 10 mA of current was utilized to obtain the diffraction pattern
of samples. A Cu Kα1 radiation source with a wavelength of 1.5418
Å was used and a Lynxeye detector was used with a slit size of
1 mm. Data were collected for each sample between 5 and 49°,
with a step size of 0.0204°.

4.4 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET)
A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer was
used for the
BET analysis. Approximately 150 mg of IL/MOF composites were used
for the measurements. Samples were activated at 125 °C under
vacuum. Subsequently, the samples were cooled down to liquid nitrogen
temperature and then the free space measurement was performed using
He. N2 gas adsorption isotherms were obtained by feeding
the gas in the range of 10–6 to 1 bar. The pressure
steps between 0.08 and 0.25 bar were used to fit the BET equation
to estimate the surface areas of the samples. Pore volumes of the
composite materials were obtained from the N2 adsorption
isotherm at 77 K using the t-plot method.

4.5 Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
A TA Instruments Q500 model thermogravimetric
analyzer was used with
a platinum pan. After taring the empty clean pan, approximately 15–20
mg of samples including pure ILs and incorporated samples were weighted.
A temperature ramp rate of 5 °C/min was employed up to 120 °C
following an isotherm treatment at 120 °C for 8 h and then the
temperature was ramped to 700 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min under
N2 flow rates of 40 and 60 mL/min for balance and purge
gases, respectively. For the comparison of thermal decomposition temperatures,
the onset (Tonset) and derivative onset
(T′onset) temperatures were determined
by extrapolation from thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative TG curves. Tonset generally overestimates the thermal decomposition
temperature compared to T′onset values. Consequently, we have considered T′onset values in this study.

4.6 Scanning
Electron Microscope
A Zeiss
Evo LS 15 scanning electron microscope was used for imaging the morphology
of pure CuBTC and IL-incorporated samples. During the analysis, a
voltage of 3 kV was applied under vacuum. Working distance was approximately
6 mm for both CuBTC and IL/CuBTC composites. We prepared the samples
in a way that about 5 mg of each sample was placed on the carbon tape
pasted on a cell.

4.7 X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)
A Bruker
S8 Tiger XRF spectrometer was used for elemental analysis of IL/MOF
samples.7 For each of the IL/MOF composites,
a container (Chemplex Industries Inc.) was filled with approximately
150 mg of powder sample and a 4 μm Prolene film support (Chemplex
Industries Inc.) was placed on top of the container and a ring was
used to immobilize the film. Under helium atmosphere, X-rays were
generated by using a 4 kW Rh anode X-ray tube. Elemental compositions
were determined using an 18 mm mask. Common ppm level impurities for
almost all of the samples were Os, La, Rh, and Ca. The SpectraPlus
Eval2 V2.2.454 software was used for data interpretation. CHO was
chosen as the matrix for all of the composites. According to the weight
percentage of each element in the composite, an element that was presented
only in the IL structure was used to obtain the corresponding IL amount,
and CuBTC amount was calculated from the weight percentage of the
Cu atom.

4.8 Gas Adsorption Measurements
We used
a Micromeritics (Particulate Systems) High Pressure Volumetric Analyzer
HPVA II-20032 for measuring the gas adsorption
performance of the IL/MOF composites. Approximately 0.35 g sample
was weighted and degassed at 125 °C under vacuum until the pressure
reaches 10–6 bar. The stabilities of ILs after degassing
the samples at this temperature were confirmed according to IR and
TGA measurements.7 After degassing, the
sample holder was connected to the analysis port and the temperature
was set to 25 °C prior to measurements; all of the lines were
purged with He three times to clean and remove any residuals from
the previous experiments. The adsorption measurements were performed
for a pressure range of 0.1–30 bar. The obtained isotherms
were fitted to Freundlich model for each sample.
