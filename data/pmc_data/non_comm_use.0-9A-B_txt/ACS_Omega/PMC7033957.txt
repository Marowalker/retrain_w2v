Investment in wearable monitoring
systems is increasing rapidly
for realizing their practical applications, for example, in medical
treatment, sports, and security systems. However, existing wearable
monitoring systems are designed to measure a real-time physical signal
and abnormal conditions rather than harmful environmental characteristics.
In this study, a flexible chemical sensor electrode based on a three-dimensional
conductive nanofilm (3D CNF) is fabricated via facile polymerization
with temperature control. The morphology and chemical state of the
3D CNF are modified via electrochemical doping control to increase
the carrier mobility and the active surface area of the sensor electrode.
The sensor electrode is highly sensitive (up to 1 ppb), selective,
and stable for an analyte (NH3) at room temperature owing
to the three-dimensional morphology of polypyrrole and the oxidation-level
control.

Introduction
Flexible electronics
have attracted much considerable attention
because of their excellent potential for application in portable devices
and displays.1−4 In particular, investment in wearable monitoring system research
has been rapidly increasing for realizing applications, for example,
in healthcare, sports, and security systems.5−7 However, conventional
wearable monitoring systems are specialized for physiological measurements
to track real-time health status and abnormal conditions rather than
hazardous environmental situations. The ability to detect harmful
and flammable substances has recently emerged as another technical
problem for sensor devices in preventing diseases because of perilous
chemicals.8−11 Therefore, it is necessary to develop small, simple, and accurate
sensing materials with low detection limits (down to ppb level) for
wearable chemical sensor systems. Considerable research has been performed
on nanosized semiconducting materials owing to their favorable characteristics,
such as their high surface-to-volume ratio and small size, which lead
to amplified signals.12−16

Among the semiconducting materials, conducting polymer nanomaterials
are used as sensing transducers because of their attractive inherent
transport properties (i.e., electrical conductivity and energy migration
at room temperature) originating from their conjugated backbone structure.17−20 Additionally, the oxidation levels of the conducting polymers can
be changed via doping processes to facilitate a sensitive and rapid
response to specific chemical species.21−23 Moreover, studies have
been performed on the morphology control of conducting polymer nanomaterials
in sensor transducers to maximize the interactions with target analytes.
For example, Park et al. fabricated a multidimensional carboxyl poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
nanotube membrane-based biosensor using electrospinning and modified
vapor deposition polymerization to detect dopamine molecules.24 Sakar et al. formulated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
polystyrene sulfonate films with quasi-periodic parallel cracks, which
had a high charge carrier mobility for use in alcohol and humidity
sensors.25 However, the synthesis steps
for morphology control at the nanoscale are complex.

Even though
conducting polymer nanomaterials exhibit high performance
as sensing transducers, there is a lack of methods for integrating
sensor components into flexible electronic circuits, limiting the
mass production of devices.26,27 In addition, the uniform
diffusion of nanosized sensing materials is an obstacle for their
application to flexible sensor devices.28−30 Several approaches have
been proposed to achieve integration with a uniform distribution.31−35 One of the most promising approaches involves the direct generation
of a conducting polymer nanostructure on a flexible substrate as a
sensing transducer. This method allows the uniform installation of
nanostructures on devices at low cost without an integration step.

Herein, we describe the formation of a three-dimensional conductive
nanofilm (3D CNF)-based chemical sensor consisting of vertically aligned
polypyrrole nanowires on a graphene substrate, through an electrodeposition
process with temperature control. The morphology of the polypyrrole
nanostructures is controlled by changing the synthesis temperature
because the micelle size and the diffusion area increase with the
temperature. Moreover, the doping level of the 3D CNF is changed using
an electrochemical oxidation process to enhance the charge-transfer
rate during the detection of the target analyte (NH3).
The 3D nanostructure and electrochemical doping enhance the active
surface area and charge-carrier (hole) transfer of the nanofilm, respectively.
Thus, the electrochemically doped nanofilm-based chemical sensor exhibits
a high sensitivity to NH3 gas, with low detection limits
(down to ppb level) and fast response and recovery times. Additionally,
the sensing ability of the chemical sensor electrode is retained after
various bending cycles because of the flexibility of the substrates
[polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and graphene] and the polypyrrole
nanofilm.

Results and Discussion
Formation Control of 3D CNF
Figure 1a shows the overall
process for the formation
of 3D CNFs via the electropolymerization method. As a template of
the conducting polymer nanostructures, monolayer graphene was introduced
onto a PEN substrate using the wet transfer method. The graphene-transferred
PEN substrate was immersed in a pyrrole-dispersed electrolyte at various
temperatures to decorate the surface with polypyrrole nanostructures.
In the electrolyte solution, a phosphate buffer maintains the pH of
the electrolyte during the polymer synthesis to prevent the influence
of the generated hydrogen ions. Additionally, p-toluenesulfonic
acid functions as not only a dopant but also a soft template of the
pyrrole to form pyrrole-containing micelles.36 In the polymerization process, the pyrrole-containing micelles are
adsorbed on the graphene surface, acting as templates at the beginning
of the polymerization (i.e., nucleation sites). The generated nucleation
sites inhibit the growth of polypyrrole in directions other than the
vertical direction owing to the steric hindrance of adjacent nanostructures.37 The steric hindrance effect is enhanced with
the growth of the polypyrrole nanostructure.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram
of the sequential fabrication steps for the
3D CNF. (b) Illustrative formation mechanism of polypyrrole nanostructures
with different temperatures on the graphene substrate.

The morphology of the generated polypyrrole nanostructures
changes
from a nanowire to a micrograin with temperature variations (Figures 2 and S1). At a low synthesis temperature (5 °C),
nucleation sites with a diameter of 50 nm are uniformly formed on
the surface, and vertically aligned polypyrrole nanowires (ca. 1 μm
long, with a diameter of ca. 70 nm) are formed after the growth process.
The nucleation sites and nanowires increase in size and become irregular
with the increasing synthesis temperature, up to 70 °C. Temperatures
higher than 70 °C result in thick-coated polypyrrole films rather
than nucleation sites and nanowires on the graphene surface. In particular,
at 90 °C, the thickness of the aggregated part of the 3D CNF
increases from 55 to 245 nm, and the diameter of the nanostructures
enhances to 210 nm (Figure S2). Additionally,
at the macroscale, the generated polypyrrole exhibits irregular surfaces
at synthesis temperatures higher than 5 °C (Figure 3). In a moderate temperature
range (45–70 °C), the films display micropores, and the
size of the pores increases with the temperature. A synthesis temperature
higher than 70 °C yields a bumpy surface rather than pores.

°C.

The morphology change of the polypyrrole
nanostructures originates
from the following mechanism (Figure 1b). First, the size of the micelles in the electrolyte
increases at higher reaction temperatures owing to the enlargement
in the hydrodynamic radius.38−40 Then, the larger containers increase
the size of the nucleation sites and enlarge the diffusion area of
each nucleation site. The extended diffusion areas of the nucleation
sites cause the overlap of the nuclei, resulting in the formation
of a mass film on the substrate during the growth process.41 In addition, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of the films are decreased with increasing temperatures
(33.9 m2 g–1 for 5 °C, 29.9 m2 g–1 for 45 °C, 24.2 m2 g–1 for 70 °C, and 18.2 m2 g–1 for 90 °C), owing to the fact that the number of nanowires
per unit area is reduced at higher temperatures (Figure S3).

Oxidation-Level Control of 3D CNF
The 3D CNF polymerized
at 5 °C presents different chemical states and morphologies with
an electrochemical oxidation-level control. During the oxidation control,
transformations of the polymer chains (such as neutral, polaron, bipolaron,
and overoxidation) occur with an increasing applied potential (Figure S4). Figure 4a shows the electrical conductivity of the
3D CNF with different oxidation levels (ranging from −1.4 to
+1.4 V). The electrical conductivity increases with the oxidation
level because a more positive potential improves the carrier density
(0.2 × 1018 to 1.31 × 1019 cm–3) in the polymer chains. There are two improvements
of the electrical conductivity—from −1.4 to −1.0
V and from 0 to 0.6 V—because of the changes in the charge-transport
property from neutral to polarons and from polarons to bipolarons,
respectively. The highest value of the electrical conductivity is
101.8 S cm–1 for an applied potential of +1.0 V.
High applied voltages (from +1.3 V) cause overoxidation of the films,
with a reduction of the electrical conductivity (to 1.3 × 10–3 S cm–1 at 1.4 V) despite the high
carrier densities.42 Additionally, the
carrier mobility (μ), which originated from the electrical conductivity
(σ) and carrier density (n0), differs
with the increasing applied potential. The carrier mobility rapidly
decreases in the overoxidation region (above 1.3 V) owing to the destruction
of the polymer chain structures, despite the high carrier density.

Figure 4 (a) Electrical
conductivity (black), carrier density (blue), and
carrier mobility (red) of the 3D CNF with an applied voltage variation.
(b) Raman spectra of the 3D CNF with different oxidation levels (black:
−1.2 V, red: −0.2 V, blue: +1.0 V, and pink: +1.4 V).

Raman spectroscopy was performed to further characterize
the 3D
CNFs. Figure 4b shows
Raman spectra with different oxidation levels ranging from −1.2
to +1.4 V. The bands at 1049 and 1332 cm–1 correspond
to the C–H in-plane and C–C stretching vibrations, respectively.
Moreover, the strong bands at 1415 and 1562 cm–1 are attributed to the C=C symmetric and C=C asymmetric
vibrations, respectively. These strong bands are shifted to 1421 and
1591 cm–1, respectively, with an increase in the
oxidation level, indicating the transformation of the polymer chains
from the benzenoid structure to a quinoid structure. Specifically,
positive-doped species (polarons or bipolarons) are located on geometrical
defects and form the quinoid structure. Therefore, more positive voltages
increase the amount of (bi)polarons and change the polymer chains
to quinoid structures.43

Furthermore,
the chemical composition of the 3D CNF was characterized
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 5 presents the new bond of the polymer chains
in the N 1s region with different applied voltages. Peaks at ca. 400
eV [related to the neutral amine N of the pyrrole unit (−NH−)]
and ca. 398 eV (related to imine (−N=)) are observed
in all cases. For a potential of −0.2 V, there is a peak corresponding
to the positively charged N (−NH+−) at 401.4
eV, indicating the formation of polarons. For more positive potentials
(+1.0 and +1.4 V), there is a bipolaron N peak (=NH+−) at 403.0 eV. Thus, increasing the oxidation level of the
3D CNF enhances the amount of positively charged N in the structure.

Figure 5 N 1s XPS
spectra of the 3D CNF with different oxidation levels:
(a) −1.2; (b) −0.2; (c) +1.0; (d) +1.4 V.

The morphology of the 3D CNF is reversibly changed for different
oxidation levels using the osmotic effect of the counterion (bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide
anion) (Figure 6).44 When electrochemical oxidation occurs, electrons
are ejected from the 3D CNF, and a positive charge is developed in
the polymer chain. Then, the anions in the electrolyte can move and
create a volume expansion in the polymer through the insertion of
counterions and the subsequent uptake of the solvent. However, excess
electro-oxidation (i.e., overoxidation) causes an irreversible volume
expansion of the polymer nanostructure. Consequently, from a macroscale
viewpoint, the CNF with overoxidation (at +1.4 V) shows cracks in
the structure, and a part of it fell off onto the PEN substrate (Figure S5). The overoxidized nanofilm is very
weak to external impacts and displays a degradation of its electroactivity.
Moreover, the diameter of the individual nanowires is enhanced from
67.7 nm at −1.2 V to 85.6 nm at +1.4 V, with an increase in
the deviation (Figure S6). Additionally,
the morphology of the individual nanowires changes as the intermediate
holes are extended to nanotubes at high voltages because of counterion
insertion. As with the field effect scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images in Figure 6,
larger pores are observed as the oxidation levels increase (7 nm for
−1.2 V, 10 nm for −0.2 V, 15 nm for +1.0 V, and 30 nm
for +1.4 V) (Figure S7). The BET surface
area also increases, that is, from 33.9 m2 g–1 (for −1.2 V) to 41.5 m2 g–1 (for
+1.4 V) at more positive potentials on account of the fact that polymer
structures are more expanded at higher oxidation levels.

Sensor Application
The real-time responsive resistance
changes were measured for different concentrations of gases at room
temperature. The 3D CNF-based sensor electrodes consist of three parts,
namely, the substrates (PEN and graphene), the source/drain electrodes
(silver paste), and the transducer (3D CNF) (Figure S8). To confirm the sensing performance of 3D CNF, a bare chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) graphene-based electrode shows a small response
at a high concentration of NH3 gas, but it cannot detect
at a low concentration (Figure S9). Therefore,
the sensing ability of the electrode at low concentrations originated
from the 3D CNF layer. First, the effect of the synthesis temperature
on the sensing performance was examined by exposing the sensor electrodes
to NH3 gas, which is a reducing gas. As shown in Figure 7, the response decreases
with the increasing reaction temperature because of the reduced active
surface area, caused by the larger nanowires and thicker aggregated
part in the 3D CNF structure. The sensing performance with respect
to the oxidation level is investigated for the 3D CNF polymerized
at 5 °C.

Figure 7 Normalized resistance changes of the 3D CNF with different
polymerization
temperatures (a) upon sequential exposure to NH3 gas and
(b) as a function of NH3 concentration (black: 5 °C;
red: 20 °C; blue: 45 °C; pink: 70 °C).

Figure 8a
shows
the sensing performance of the electrodes with respect to the oxidation
level. The sensor electrode oxidized at +1.0 V exhibits the highest
sensitivity (down to 1 ppb) to NH3 on account of the high
carrier density (hole) and the additional inner channel in the nanowire
structure. In contrast, despite the improved active sites in the structure,
the electrode oxidized at +1.4 V shows no response to the NH3 gas, owing to the destruction of the conjugated polymer chains.
A highly sensitive electrode is achieved in the bipolaron state (at
1.0 V), with a large amount of charge carriers and additional active
sites for NH3. Figure 8b presents the recovery times of the electrodes, indicating
a decrease from 59 s (at −1.2 V) to 19 s (at +1.0 V). The large
number of charge carriers induces the rapid transfer of electrons
from the analyte and reduces the response time to <20 s. However,
because the detachment of the target molecule is related to the applied
external energy rather than to the charge carriers and the number
of active sites, the recovery times of the electrodes are similar
(66 s for −1.2 V, 61 s for −0.2 V, and 56 s for +1.0
V) (Figure 8c). Additionally,
to confirm the sensing ability for an oxidizing gas (the opposite
charge-transfer direction), methanol (MeOH) molecules were detected
(Figure 8d). As observed
in the case of NH3, the electrode oxidized at +1.0 V is
superior to the other electrodes, for the same reason. Figure 8e shows the normalized resistance
changes of the electrodes with respect to the NH3 and MeOH
gas concentrations. The linear behavior range is larger for the electrode
oxidized at +1.0 V (1 ppb to 102 ppm for NH3 and 0.1 to 103 ppm for MeOH) than for the other electrodes.
Therefore, the sensor electrode oxidized at +1.0 V can be effectively
utilized as a signal transducer for detecting NH3 and MeOH
gases at various concentrations.

current value (10–6 A) of the 3D CNF with different
oxidation levels. (a) Normalized resistance changes upon sequential

1 ppb of NH3 gas. Normalized resistance changes of the
+1.0 V applied 3D CNF under (g) various bending angles and (h) repeated
bending cycles. (i) Sensing performance histogram of the +1.0 V applied
3D CNF to different oxidizing and reducing volatile gases. The concentrations
of gases are as follow: 1 ppm for NH3 and MeOH and 100
ppm for others.

Outstanding flexibility and cycle
stability are required for electrode
materials used in practical wearable sensor devices. Figure 8f presents the resistance change
of the oxidized electrode at +1.0 V under a periodic exposure to 1
ppb NH3 gas. During five repetitive on–off tests,
the resistance changes remained relatively constant, without a delay
in the response or recovery. Moreover, the flexibility of the substrates
(PEN and graphene) and the polypyrrole nanofilm allows the electrodes
to perform consistent detection even if they are modified in several
ways. The resistance of the sensor electrodes, along with concave
and convex deformations at different angles, shows a similar value
at 1 ppb NH3 (Figure 8g). Additionally, repeated bending deformation (up
to 500 cycles) has no significant effect on the sensing performance,
owing to the uniformity of each component (CNF and Ag paste) on the
substrate (Figures 8h and S10).

The selectivity of sensor
electrodes is also important for practical
applications. Figure 8i presents the normalized resistance changes of the electrode oxidized
at +1.0 V under exposure to various volatile gases at low concentrations
(1 ppm for NH3 and MeOH; 100 ppm for others). Even though
it has a lower concentration than the other gases, NH3 yields
a signal change more than 10 times larger. Therefore, NH3 can be distinguished from other chemicals according to the extent
and direction of the resistance changes. Thus, the sensing performance
of the 3D CNF-based electrode is higher than that of other conventional
conducting polymer-based sensor electrodes (Table 1).22,45−48

Conclusions
3D CNFs were formed through a facile polymerization method with
synthesis temperature control as transducers for a chemical sensor.
The chemical states and morphologies of the 3D CNFs are changed using
an electrochemical oxidation method. The 3D CNF oxidized at 1.0 V
exhibits the highest charge carrier density (1.31 × 1019 cm–3), as well as an inner channel that enhances
the interaction with the target analyte and increases the charge-transfer
rate in the sensor electrode. The 3D CNF-based sensor shows a high
sensitivity (down to 1 ppb) to NH3 gas and fast response
times (<20 s) at room temperature. Moreover, the chemical sensor
displays flexibility, cycle stability under various deformations,
and selectivity to NH3 gas. Thus, the function of conductive
nanostructures is optimized through the shape and chemical-state control,
and the proposed method is effective for developing electrical devices
and sensor systems.

Experimental Section
Materials
Pyrrole,
sodium p-toluenesulfonate
(pTSA), and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiBis)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate
(Dibasic) and sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate (Monobasic) were
purchased from Junsei Chemical Co. All chemical reagents were used
as received, without further purification.

Formation of 3D CNF
A 3D CNF was prepared on a graphene–PEN
film via an electrodeposition reaction in a 100 mL aqueous solution
containing 0.1 mol of pyrrole, 0.2 mol of sodium phosphates (1:1 molar
ratio of Dibasic/Monobasic), and 0.1 mol of pTSA. The graphene–PEN
film was prepared by CVD and a wet transfer method, as described in
previous reports.9,14 Electrodeposition was performed
at different temperatures under a constant potential of +0.8 V for
15 min in a three-electrode cell consisting of a Pt wire, Ag/AgCl,
and the CVD graphene–PEN film as the counter, reference, and
working electrodes, respectively. After the electrodeposition, the
3D CNF was rinsed with deionized (DI) water and dried at room temperature.

Oxidation-Level Control of 3D CNF
Oxidation-level control
of the 3D CNF was conducted in the potentiostat mode using a three-electrode
cell with 50 mL of a 0.1 M LiBis aqueous electrolyte. A Pt wire, Ag/AgCl,
and the 3D CNF were used as the counter, reference, and working electrodes,
respectively. A constant voltage was applied to the 3D CNF electrode
for 3 min, and the voltage was changed from −1.6 to +1.4 V
stepwise, with 0.2 V intervals. The electrical resistance was measured
via a four-probe method using a source meter immediately after each
voltage application phase. The oxidation-level-controlled 3D CNF was
rinsed with DI water and dried at room temperature.

Electrical
Sensing Measurement of Volatile Organic Compound
Gases
Gas sensor electrodes were prepared by painting each
end of the 3D CNF with Ag paste and attaching a Cu wire to the ends
at a distance of 1 cm. The sensor electrode was placed inside a vacuum
chamber (100 Torr) and connected to a source meter to monitor
the resistance change using a computer. In this experiment, a bubbler
was used to vaporize different gases and to mix the vapors with N2 gas using a mass flow controller to modify the concentration
of the analytes. The sensor electrode was exposed to various concentrations
(1 ppb to 100 ppm) for 100 s and purged with N2 gas for
the conductance to recover. The measurement was conducted by applying
a constant current of 10–6 A to the electrode, and
the response was calculated by measuring the normalized electrical
resistance change ΔR/R0 = (R – R0)/R0, where R and R0 represent the measured real-time resistance
and initial resistance, respectively. The response time was defined
as the time taken for the resistance to reach 90% of the saturated
value after the gas exposure, and the recovery time was defined as
the time taken for the resistance to reach 90% of the initial value
after purging with N2 gas.

Characterization
FE-SEM images were obtained using
a JSM-6701F (JEOL Ltd., Japan). Raman spectra were obtained using
a DXR2xi (Thermo, USA) installed at NCIRF at Seoul National University.
XPS data were acquired using a Sigma Probe (Thermo, USA). The electrical
conductivity was measured using a Keitheley 2400, and the amount of
charge was recorded using an electrochemical workstation (WBCS3000,
WonATech, Korea). The electrodeposition and oxidation-level control
were performed using WBCS3000. The electrical conductivity, charge
carrier mobility, and charge carrier density were calculated using
the following equations.

The electrical conductivity was calculated
as 1  where L represents the length, A represents the area of the CNF, and R represents
the resistance measured by the source meter.

The charge carrier
mobility was calculated as 2  where n0 represents
the charge carrier density and |e| represents the
electrical charge of the carrier.

The charge carrier density
was calculated as 3  where q represents the amount
of charge and V represents the volume of the nanofilm.
