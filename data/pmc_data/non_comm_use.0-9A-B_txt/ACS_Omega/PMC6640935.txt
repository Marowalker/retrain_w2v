We report the preparation of polymer nanofibers with enhanced flame
retardancy by coaxial electrospinning polyamide 66 (PA 66) and nanoscale
graphene hybridized with red phosphorus (NG–RP). Transmission
electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed
that the nanofibers contained a NG–RP-based core surrounded
by a PA 66 shell. The flame-retardant characteristics of the nanofibers
were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis, micro combustion
calorimetry, and a series of vertical flame tests. The encapsulation
of the NG–RP not only enhanced the flame-retardant characteristics
of the nanofibers, but also improved their mechanical properties while
maintaining the color and luster of the polymer, making the resultant
nanofibers appropriate for use in a wide range of applications.

Introduction
The electrospinning
of synthetic polymers continues to grow in
popularity as a method because it not only enables fine control over
the architecture1−3 and dimensions of the resultant nanofibers,4 but it can also be conveniently scaled.5 As a result, electrospun nanofibers have been
extensively used in a variety of applications, including drug delivery,6 tissue engineering,7 and energy harvesting.8 Unfortunately,
neat polymer nanofibers are often combustible and,9 as a result, there is currently a need for flame-retardant
derivatives. Although the use of polymers with noncombustible functional
groups10 and surface modification strategies
represent established approaches for enhancing the flame retardancies
of polymer nanofibers,11−13 the former often suffers from technical complexity
and the latter diminishes fiber durability and esthetics (i.e., color
options and luster). As a result, the development of new methods for
preparing flame-retardant polymer nanofibers is warranted.

Coaxial
electrospinning typically produces nanofibers with a polymeric
material as the shell and a functional component as the core. As the
two structural components are often synergistic,14,15 we hypothesized that nanofibers containing flame-retardant cores
should reduce the combustibility of the polymeric shells. Therefore,
a primary aim of our efforts was to produce core–shell structured
polymer nanofibers via coaxial electrospinning.

Graphene has
recently attracted significant attention for use in
flame-retardant polymer-based composites,16,17 in part because it forms a protective char layer upon combustion18 and can be hybridized with other flame retardants.16,19 Despite these advantages, several challenges have prevented graphene
from being broadly used in applications that require a resistance
to combustion. First, it is often difficult to evenly distribute graphene
in synthetic polymer matrices, which can compromise the mechanical
properties of the resulting composites.20 Second, the flame-retardant efficiency of graphene is relatively
low and thus combination with other types of flame retardants is usually
required.21,22 Finally, the synthesis of graphene-based
flame retardants requires the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals,
which inherently restricts utility and scalability.16 To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, we recently reported
a one-step ball-milling method for hybridizing red phosphorus (RP)
with graphene.23 The resultant composite
was found to significantly improve the flame retardancy as well as
the mechanical properties of polymer foams.

Building on our
previous work, we report the first flame-retardant
nanofibers that feature flame-retardant cores and polymer shells.
The nanofibers were fabricated by the coaxial electrospinning of polyamide
66 (PA 66) with a composite of nanoscale graphite (NG) and RP. PA
66 was selected as the polymer component due to its excellent mechanical
properties, good processability, and broad utility.24,25 NG was chosen as a source of graphene because it was found to increase
the dispersibility of the RP particles on the surface of the graphene
platelets, which synergistically enhanced the flame retardancy of
the resultant nanoscale graphene hybridized with RP (NG–RP)
nanoplatelets. Compared to the neat nanofibers of PA 66, those that
contained NG–RP exhibited enhanced flame-retardant and mechanical
properties, while maintaining the color and luster intrinsic to PA
66.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of the NG–RP
Nanoplatelets
The NG–RP nanoplatelets were prepared
in one-step by ball
milling NG with RP. NG was used as the starting material because it
improved the dispersibility of RP and facilitated access to the platelets
of graphene (see Figure S1). As shown in Figure 1, the morphologies
and sizes of NG, RP, and the NG–RP nanoplatelets were characterized
by electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed
that the dimensions of the NG and RP particles were on the order of
ca. hundreds of nanometers and ca. micrometers, respectively. In contrast,
the dimensions of the NG–RP nanoplatelets were found to be
significantly smaller, presumably due to the shear forces generated
during ball milling. The reduction in particle size was subsequently
confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that elemental
carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus were homogeneously distributed in the
NG–RP composites (see Figure S2).

Figure 1 Summary
of morphological characterization data. SEM images of (a)
NG, (b) RP, and (c) the NG–RP platelets. (d) A TEM image of
a NG–RP platelet.

The structure displayed by the NG–RP nanoplatelets
was also
investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Figure 2a, the XRD pattern
recorded for NG exhibited a strong and sharp (002) diffraction peak
at 26.5°, which corresponded to an interlayer d-spacing of 0.34 nm. Consistent with the exfoliation of NG during
the ball-milling process, the XRD pattern recorded for NG–RP
composite did not exhibit a signal at the aforementioned angle. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to gain
a deeper insight into the chemical composition of the aforementioned
materials. As shown in Figure 2b, NG exhibited a strong C 1s signal at 285 eV, along with
a weak O 1s signal at 533 eV. For comparison, the NG–RP nanoplatelets
exhibited increased O 1s and C 1s signals, as well as two new signals
at 192 and 134 eV, which were assigned to the P 2s and P 2p orbitals,
respectively. The increased intensity of the O 1s signal may be attributed
to inadvertent oxidation that occurred when the as-prepared NG–RP
composite was exposed to air after the ball-milling process.16 Regardless, the detection of the P 2s and P
2p signals indicated that RP was hybridized with NG. Deconvolution
of the high resolution C 1s XPS spectrum revealed that species containing
C–C, C–P, and C–O bonds were present (Figure S3), which further supported the conclusions
that hybridization as well as oxidation had occurred.26,27 Additional structural elucidation was obtained by fitting the high
resolution P 2p XPS spectrum recorded for NG–RP. The presence
of P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 species at 130.2 and
131.0 eV was assigned to RP in the NG–RP nanoplatelets, and
the P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 signals centered at
134.5 and 135.3 eV were consistent with the presence of phosphate.

Figure 2 (a) XRD
patterns, (b) XPS survey spectra, (c) Raman spectra, and
(d) thermal data recorded for NG and the NG–RP nanoplatelets
(indicated). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data were collected
under nitrogen.

As summarized in Figure 2c, Raman spectroscopy
further supported the structural assignment.
NG was minimally defective as the intensity ratio of the D:G bands
(ID/IG) was
measured to be ∼0.21. In contrast, ID/IG of NG–RP was determined to
be 1.05, which is consistent with the presence of a significant number
of structural defects, which may have occurred upon oxidation and/or
exfoliation.28 As will be discussed below,
the aforementioned structural features play important roles in improving
the flame-retardant and mechanical properties of the NG–RP-containing
polymer nanofibers.29

To investigate
the thermal stability of the NG–RP particles,
a series of TGA measurements were independently performed under atmospheres
of nitrogen or air. As shown in Figure 2d, the NG–RP particles exhibited three weight
loss stages: (i) below 200 °C, due to evaporation of absorbed
moisture; (ii) 200–500 °C, due to condensation of phosphonic
acid;17 and (iii) above 600 °C, due
to pyrolysis of graphitic carbon and residual phosphorus. For comparison,
the TGA data recorded for the NG–RP nanoplatelets under air
exhibited a weight increase between 226–540 °C, presumably
due to oxidation of RP (Figure S4). Significant
weight loss occurred around 575 °C and was attributed to the
condensation of phosphonic acid.

Preparation of the Core–Shell
Structured Nanofibers
After investigating their morphology
and composition, the NG–RP
nanoplatelets were encapsulated by PA 66 and incorporated into nanofibers.
To tune the content of NG–RP in the resultant nanofibers, polymer
solutions with initial concentrations of 15, 17.5, or 20 wt % were
independently used for the coaxial electrospinning process. The resulting
fibers were labeled as NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5), NG–RP@PA
66 (1:8.75), and NG–RP@PA 66 (1:10), respectively; the ratios
in parentheses refer to the weight ratios of NG–RP:PA 66 in
the nanofiber feedstocks. As a control, neat PA 66 nanofibers were
also prepared by electrospinning the polymer in the absence of the
NG–RP platelets.

SEM revealed that the nanofibers exhibited
smooth surfaces and were randomly distributed on the underlying substrate
(Figure 3a–c).
The use of relatively concentrated solutions of PA 66 in the electrospinning
process afforded nanofibers with larger average diameters (from 225
to 425 nm) (Figure 3d–f). Unlike the uniform contrast that was observed in the
TEM images recorded for the neat PA 66 nanofibers (Figure S5), the images of those containing NG–RP exhibited
dark and bright regions with complete concentricity (Figure 3g–i), which is consistent
with a solid structure. The core–shell structures of the NG–RP@PA
66 nanofibers as well as the uniform dispersion of NG–RP in
the cores were confirmed using TEM. Moreover, EDS elemental mapping
indicated that phosphorus was uniformly dispersed along the NG–RP@PA
66 nanofibers (Figure S6).

Figure 3 SEM images recorded of
the (a) NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5), (b)
NG–RP@PA 66 (1:8.75), and (c) NG–RP@PA 66 (1:10) nanofibers.
The corresponding diameter distributions are shown in panels (d–f)
and were obtained by counting 100 randomly chosen nanofibers. TEM
images recorded of the (g) NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5), (h) NG–RP@PA
66 (1:8.75), and (i) NG–RP@PA 66 (1:10) nanofibers. The white
dashed lines denote the boundaries between the core and the shell
regions.

To explore how the incorporation
of the NG–RP nanoplatelets
influenced the mechanical properties displayed by the corresponding
nanofibers, a series of tensile tests were performed. As summarized
in Figure 4, the tensile
strength and Young’s modulus of the fabrics prepared using
neat PA 66 nanofibers were measured to be 6.2 and 69.0 MPa, respectively.
Incorporating NG–RP into the cores of the nanofibers enhanced
their mechanical properties. For example, a fabric containing the
NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5) nanofibers exhibited a tensile strength
of 9.3 MPa and a Young’s modulus of 119.2 MPa. The enhanced
mechanical properties of the NG–RP@PA 66 nanofibers were attributed
to the incorporation of NG–RP nanoplatelets of high mechanical
strength as well as their uniform dispersion along the cores of the
nanofibers.

various nanofibers (indicated). (a) Tensile strength and (b) Young’s
modulus values. The error bars represent the standard deviations of
data obtained from three separate experiments.

Evaluation of the Flame-Retardant Properties of the Core–Shell
Structured Nanofibers
To ascertain how the NG–RP nanoplatelets
influenced the thermal stabilities displayed by the NG–RP@PA
66 nanofibers, a series of TGA measurements were performed. The initial
decomposition temperature at which a weight loss of 5% occurs has
been used as an indicator of polymer thermal stability.30−33 As shown in Figure 5, neat PA 66 nanofibers exhibited such decomposition at 314.2 °C,
which was lower than that recorded for the NG–RP@PA 66 nanofibers
(341.1–347.8 °C; see Table S1). In addition, the content of NG–RP in the corresponding
nanofibers was estimated from the residual masses and found to be
in agreement with the relative weight ratios of the PA 66 and NG–RP
feedstocks.

Figure 5 TGA curves of neat and NG–RP@PA 66 nanofibers obtained under
an atmosphere of air.

The char residues formed after thermal degradation were also
examined
and appeared to correlate with the flame-retardant properties of the
nanofibers. For example, neat PA 66 nanofibers afforded a char yield
of ca. 0.41% at 700 °C, however the char yields given by the
NG–RP@PA 66 nanofibers were significantly higher (up to 6.37%
for the NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5) nanofibers at the same temperature).
We surmised that NG–RP significantly improved the char formation
properties of the PA 66 nanofibers by acting as a physical barrier
and catalyzed the charring effect of phosphate.34

Because the NG–RP@PA 66 nanofibers exhibited
relatively
high thermal stabilities, we evaluated their flammability by subjecting
nanofiber-derived fabrics to a flame for 12 s (ASTM D6413–11a).
As a control, a fabric prepared using the neat PA 66 nanofibers was
also tested. As shown in Figure 6, the NG–RP-containing fabrics required longer
periods of time to ignite and less damage was observed when compared
to that of the control. Indeed, all of the fabrics that contained
NG–RP self-extinguished the propagating flame, which left the
upper portions of the test samples unburned (Figures 6b–d). The aforementioned results demonstrate
that the NG–RP nanoplatelets effectively enhanced the flame
retardancy of the PA 66 nanofibers.

Figure 6 Photographs taken of fabrics composed
of the indicated nanofibers
after vertical flame testing: (a) neat PA 66; (b) NG–RP@PA
66 (1:10); (c) NG–RP@PA 66 (1:8.75); (d) NG–RP@PA 66
(1:7.5).

The flame retardancy of the NG–RP@PA
66 nanofibers was further
evaluated using micro combustion calorimetry (MCC) as this is an established
technique for evaluating material combustion characteristics.22,35 As summarized in Figure 7, heat release rates (HRR) were measured as a function of
temperature for neat PA 66 as well as for the NG–RP-containing
nanofibers. The total heat release (THR) value for the neat PA 66
nanofibers was measured to be 12.55 kJ g–1 with
a peak HRR (pHRR) of 150.8 W g–1. As summarized
in Table S2, encapsulating NG–RP
in the cores of the nanofibers sharply reduced the corresponding pHRR
and THR values. For example, the NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5) nanofibers
exhibited THR and pHRR values of 6.21 kJ g–1 and
110.3 W g–1, respectively, which decreased by ca.
50.5 and 26.9%, respectively, when compared with the analogous values
measured for the neat PA 66 nanofibers. The NG–RP-containing
nanofibers were also found to display pHRR at temperatures lower than
that of the neat PA 66 nanofibers, which may be due to the high thermal
conductivity of the NG–RP particles. Regardless, the lower
pHRR and THR values were attributed to the formation of high char
residues during combustion, which decreased the release of gases and
thus attenuated the HRR.34

recorded for various nanofibers (indicated).

Conclusions
In summary, core–shell structured
PA 66 nanofibers with
enhanced flame retardancy were prepared by encapsulating NG–RP
platelets using a coaxial electrospinning method. The NG–RP
platelets were prepared by ball milling NG and RP. The use of NG facilitated
the formation of nanoscale graphene platelets, which further improved
the dispersibility of the RP nanoparticles. Although the NG–RP@PA
66 nanofibers exhibited similar surface morphologies and sizes to
those prepared using neat PA 66, the mechanical and flame-retardant
properties of the former were considerably improved. The enhancements
were attributed to the homogeneous distribution of and the flame retardancy
intrinsic to the NG–RP nanoplatelets. In addition, the color
and luster of PA 66 were maintained in the resulting nanofibers, which
should facilitate their use in a wide range of applications. Considering
that the coaxial electrospinning methodology described herein is straightforward
to perform, inexpensive, and environmentally-benign, we expect that
it will facilitate the realization of new classes of high performance,
flame-retardant polymer nanofibers.

Experimental Section
Materials
PA 66 (Polynil P50 FI; Nilit America Co.,
Ltd.) was purified by dissolving the polymer in formic acid followed
by pouring the resulting solution into excess methanol. A precipitate
formed, which was subsequently collected and then dried in a vacuum
oven set at 45 °C for 24 h. NG with an average diameter of 500
nm was obtained from Qingdao Tianheda Graphite Co., Ltd. RP (98.5%,
analytical reagent) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd.
All other chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Co., Ltd.,
and used as received.

Synthesis of NG–RP
A stainless
steel capsule
(100 mL) containing stainless steel balls (diameter: 5 mm, 250 g total)
was charged with NG (2.5 g) and RP (5.0 g). The capsule was sealed
under argon, affixed to a planetary ball mill machine, and agitated
at 480 rpm for 48 h. The resultant products were carefully collected
and then dried in a vacuum oven set at 45 °C for 12 h. CAUTION:
the materials obtained using this method are prone to combustion upon
exposure to air!

Coaxial Electrospinning of PA 66 and NG–RP
(NG–RP@PA
66)
Solutions of PA 66 with concentrations of 15, 17.5, or
20 wt % were obtained by dissolving the polymer in an appropriate
volume of formic acid and dichloromethane (6:4 w/w) with the aid of
stirring at 40 °C for 24 h. A suspension of NG–RP (20
mg mL–1) was obtained by dispersing NG–RP
(100 mg) in acetic acid (5.0 mL) with the aid of ultrasonication.
Nanofibers were prepared using a horizontal coaxial electrospinning
apparatus. A solution of PA 66 and the suspension of NG–RP
were separately fed into a syringe pump (Beijing Slgo Medical Technology
Co., Ltd.) that was connected to a coaxial spinneret (inner needle:
21-gauge; outer needle: 15-gauge). The spinneret was connected to
a high direct current voltage power supply (Tianjin Dongwen High Voltage
Power Supply Co., Ltd.), and a voltage of 30 kV was applied between
the coaxial spinneret, which was positively biased, and a steel plate
that was covered with Al foil. The distance between the coaxial spinneret
and the nanofiber collector was measured to be 8 cm. The feeding rates
of the solution of PA 66 and the suspension of NG–RP were set
to be 0.5 and 2 mL h–1, respectively. The resulting
nanofibers were dried in a vacuum oven set at 45 °C for 24 h.
All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–30
°C) with a relative humidity of 40–50%. The nanofibers
were prepared by electrospinning solutions of PA 66 in concentrations
of 15, 17.5, or 20 wt % and denoted as NG–RP@PA 66 (1:7.5),
NG–RP@PA 66 (1:8.75), and NG–RP@PA 66 (1:10), respectively;
the ratios in parentheses refer to the weight ratios of NG–RP:PA
66 in the nanofiber feedstocks.

Electrospinning of Neat
PA 66 Nanofibers
Neat PA 66
nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning the aforementioned PA
66 solutions using a single 15-gauge spinneret. All of the other parameters
were the same as those used to prepare the NG–RP@PA 66 nanofibers
described above.

General Characterization Techniques
SEM and EDS elemental
mapping were performed using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. TEM of the
NG–RP composites was performed with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope
at 200 kV. TEM of the nanofibers was performed with a JEOL HT7700
microscope at 100 kV. XRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker D8
Focus diffractometer using an incident wavelength of 0.154 nm (Cu
Kα radiation) and a Lynx-Eye detector. XPS was performed with
a PHI Quantera scanning X-ray microprobe equipped with a monochromated
Al Kα radiation source (1486.7 eV). Raman spectra were collected
on a Renishaw inVia-Reflex confocal Raman microscope at an excitation
wavelength of 532 nm. TGA was performed with a TGA Q50 system at a
scanning rate of 10 °C min–1. Mechanical properties
were measured using a universal testing machine (Instron-5966; Instron
Co. Ltd.) at a crosshead rate of 3 mm min–1 on specimens
with dimensions of 0.8 cm × 6.0 cm × 50 μm; samples
were tested in triplicate and the average values were reported. Vertical
flame tests were performed using a CZF-3 type instrument (Jiangning
Analysis Instrument Company, China); each sample was tested five times.
MCC (MCC-2; Govmark Ltd., McHenry, IL) was performed over the temperature
range of 75–750 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C s–1.
