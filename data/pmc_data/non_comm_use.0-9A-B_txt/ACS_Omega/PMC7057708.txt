We
synthesized two dTTP analogues for copper-free “click”
chemistry-coupling in the active sites of DNA polymerases. We found
that in the presence of both analogues, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was suppressed by up to
93%. This inhibitory effect was not recovered by an excess amount
of primer–template unlike that for a conventional HIV RT inhibitor,
azidothymidine. This finding may become the basis for the development
of efficient in vivo inhibitors of HIV RT and other DNA polymerases.

Introduction
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS caused by human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) is the top noncurable infectious disease in the world.
Although disease management through antiretroviral therapy has greatly
increased patient longevity, antiretrovirals remain largely unchanged
since their inception in the 1990s.1 Lack
of progress has led to the emergence of multidrug resistant HIV, making
many of the current therapies obsolete. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs) inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) by chain
termination: once incorporated into a growing DNA strand, they fail
to support further elongation due to the absence of the 3′-OH
group. Initially, NRTIs efficiently inhibited HIV, but the prolonged
use of these drugs along with high viral mutagenicity led to the rise
of mutant RT forms.2 There are two major
mechanisms of NRTI resistance developed by HIV in patients under therapy:
(i) ability of RT mutants to discriminate against the triphosphate
derivatives of NRTIs3 and (ii) the ability
to excise 3′-terminal chain terminators, through phosphorolysis
mediated by a pyrophosphate donor, which is likely to be ATP under
physiological conditions.3 Interestingly,
the excision reaction can be inhibited by binding of the next complementary
nucleotide,4 suggesting a route to generate
new RT inhibitors that may address the shortcomings of the current
NRTIs. For example, HIV RT inhibitors that block both the primer and
dNTP-binding sites would prevent ATP binding and the phosphorolysis
reaction. One strategy to achieve this goal is to create a bivalent
inhibitor that is synthesized in the active site of HIV RT by cross-linking
the terminal nucleotide with incoming dNTP. Here, we synthesized two
dNTP analogues that can produce a cross-linking product in the HIV
RT active site. The system, named here, two-component inhibitor (TCI),
was found to efficiently inhibit HIV RT in vitro.

The formation
of a bivalent inhibitor in the active site of RT
will have therapeutic significance if achieved using otherwise nontoxic
biocompatible reagents. We, therefore, turned our attention to the
well-established azide/alkyne-based “click” reaction.5 The reaction has been used in a number of exciting
applications including fluorescent probes for tracking biomolecular
complexes,6 for attaching antibodies and
other ligands to nanoemulsions,7 fluorescent
labeling of graphene nanoribbons,8 among
a number of other well-recognized applications.5,9 The
reaction requires Cu+ as a catalyst, which limits the applicability
of click reaction for therapeutic purposes due to poor availability
of Cu+ in vivo.5 Bertozzi and
colleagues10 developed a Cu-independent
“click chemistry” in which azides react with cyclooctynes,
for example, the dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO), in a strain-promoted reaction.
The reaction proceeds within minutes in live cells with no apparent
toxicity (Scheme 1A).11 Here, we took advantage of the Cu+-free “click” reaction to develop a TCI inhibitor of
HIV RT.

Scheme 1 Design of Click-Chemistry-Based Two-Component Inhibitor (TCI)
for
Inactivation of HIV RT
(A) HIV RT-assisted Cu-free
“click” reaction and possible HIV RT inhibition. In
vivo R1 and R2 could be the residues of NRTI triphosphates or viral
RNA/DNA. In this work, R1 and R2 were a dTTP analogue and a DNA primer/template,
respectively. (B) Synthetic schemes for 6Az-dTTP and DBCO-dTTP starting from aadTTP. The yields were
31 and 19% for 6Az-dTTP and DBCO-dTTP, respectively.
(C) Primer/template (P/T) design for “click” chemistry-based
TCI. The primer was fluorescein (FAM) labeled. The protruding 3′
end of the template had only one A (red).

We hypothesized that formation of a cross-linking product between
modified incoming NRTI (either R1 or R2 in Scheme 1A) and the primer (either R1 or R2 in Scheme 1A) will form a nonnatural
adduct, which will not only terminate primer elongation but also block
the dNTP-binding site, thus inhibiting RT more efficiently than conventional
chain terminators. In this prove-of-concept study, we synthesized
and characterized two dTTP analogues instead of more expensive ddNTP/NRTI
analogues. We demonstrated their ability to inhibit HIV RT in an in
vitro system.

Results and Discussion
dTTP analogues
with an azido group (6Az-dTTP) and
with a DBCO group (DBCO-dTTP) were synthesized according
to Scheme 1B and procedures
described earlier.11,12 Both compounds were characterized
by NMR as described in the Supporting Information. We then tested the substrate properties of the dTTP analogues.
The primer–template (P/T) substrate was designed to allow the
addition of only one dTTP or its analogue to the first position of
the growing primer (Scheme 1C). The addition of dVTPs (where V is a mixture of A, C, and
G) resulted in the synthesis of a 36-mer fluorescein-labeled DNA,
a product of complete primer elongation. Both analogues were efficiently
incorporated into the 3′ end of the fluorescein (FAM)-labeled
primer (Figure 1, lanes
4 and 6). After incorporation, the modified primers served as substrates
for further extension by VTPs (lanes 5 and 7) at a comparable rate
to the primer containing natural dTTP (lane 3). This result is in
agreement with the early observations that dTTP analogues modified
at the fifth position with bulky substituents retain their substrate
properties for HIV RT.11−14 Interesting, two elongation products were observed in the presence
of DBCO-dTTP (Figure 1, lanes 6, 10, and 11). We hypothesized that the lower
band (blue arrows) resulted from DBCO group detachment due to hydrolysis
of the amide bond (indicated by the red arrow in Scheme 1B). It is likely that the amide
bond is twisted and thus susceptible to hydrolysis as was reported
earlier.15,16 Interestingly, a low mobility band was not
formed when 6Az-dTTP was added after DBCO-dTTP (lane 10). This finding indicates either the absence of click reaction
due to unfavorable steric orientation of the reacting groups or quick
degradation of the formed click product when bound to HIV RT.

Figure 1 Substrate properties
of 6Az-dTTP and DBCO-dTTP in primer elongation
catalyzed by HIV-1 RT. All samples contained
an 18 nt FAM-labeled primer/template complex (Scheme 1C) and 50 nM HIV RT in reaction buffer (50
mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 100 mg/mL BSA,
and 2 mM DTT). The samples contained 5 mM dTTP, 6Az-dTTP, DBCO-dTTP, and 5 mM dVTP (V is either A, C, or G)
added in different orders as indicated (e.g., +1 means
first added). All samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20–30
min at each stage of dNTP addition as described in the Supporting Information followed by analysis by
electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The
product of click reaction is indicated by green arrows (lanes 8 and
9). The primer elongation products with detached DBCO groups are indicated
by blue arrows in lanes 6, 10, and 11.

Importantly, when 6Az-dTTP and DBCO-dTTP were used together, primer elongation was inhibited. Indeed, when
the primer was elongated in the presence of 6Az-dTTP followed
by adding DBCO-dTTP, we observed the formation of a lower
mobility product (lanes 8 and 9, green arrows), which is likely to
be the product of DBCO-dTTP addition to the azido-group-modified
primer (Figure S5). Following the addition
of dVTP did not lead to further primer elongation (lane 9). These
data indicate that (i) binding of DBCO and azido groups can be brought
in close proximity at the RT binding site for the “click”
reaction to occur, and (ii) the reaction products inhibit HIV RT.
The cross-link between DBCO groups containing primer 6Az-dTTPs was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Figure S5). A similar inhibition of HIV RT activity
was observed when DBCO-dTMP was first added to the 3′ end of
the primer by HIV RT (lanes 10 and 11).

To further confirm HIV
RT inactivation, we used a filter-binding
assay, a standard method for quantification of DNA polymerase activities.17 Only samples containing the TCI system (Figure 2, bars 4 and 5) inactivated
HIV RT efficiently, which correlates with the data shown in Figure 1. Interestingly,
TCI efficiently suppressed RT activity regardless of which the dTTP
analogue was introduced in the primer first.

Figure 2 HIV-1 RT activity by
TCI and its components measured by the filter
binding assay. P/T (1 μM) and HIV RT (50 nM) were incubated
with dTTP or first dTTP analogue and incubation for 45 min at 37 °C.
Next, second dTTP analogue was added to samples 4 and 5, and all samples
were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition
of the dNTP mixture (100 mM dATP, 100 mM dTTP, 100 mM dCTP, and 10
mM [3H]dGTP and incubation for 45 min at 37 °C. All
reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA (0.5 M) and analyzed
by filter binding assay as described in the Supporting Information. The data of three independent experiments with
single standard deviations are presented.

NRTIs used in clinical practice block growing viral DNA but not
the RT activity itself. Given that a new primer is available, RT can
resume DNA synthesis, thus contributing to the viral survival. This
can reduce the efficiency of conventional NRTI and contribute to the
development of drug resistant mutants. Data of Figures 1 and 2 suggest the
inactivation of HIV RT itself by the TCI system rather than rendering
the primer inactive. To further prove this hypothesis, we studied
the inhibitory activity of TCI under the condition when the excess
amount of DNA substrate is available. We compared the TCI inhibition
activity with that of the most common NRTI, azidothymidine (AZT).
An almost 3-fold enzyme recovery was observed upon the addition of
the excess amount of template to the RT inhibited by AZT (Figure 3, comparing bars
1 and 2). In contrast, the excess amount of P/T did not significantly
recover RT inhibited by the TCI system (comparing bars 3 with 4),
suggesting that HIV-1 RT binds tightly or irreversibly to the primer-DBCO-dTTP cross-linking product (Scheme 1A), which cannot be displaced by an excess
amount of primer.

Figure 3 TCI inhibitory effect is not significantly recovered by
access
amount of primer–template (P/T). All reaction mixtures contained
P/T and HIV RT in the reaction buffer. In addition, samples 1 and
2 contained azidothymidine (AZT), while samples 3 and 4 contained
both 6Az-dTTP and DBCO-dTTP. The samples
were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples 2 and 4 were then
treated with 1 μM P/T (to double its concentration), while all
samples were treated with the dNTP mixture (100 μM dATP, 100
μM dTTP, 100 μM dCTP, 10 μM [8-H3]-dGTP) followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C.
All reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA (0.5 M) and transferred
to DE 81 paper for quantification by a filter binding assay (see the Supporting Information for details). The data
of three independent experiments with single standard deviations are
presented.

Current drug development programs
are primarily focused on finding
a lead compound that inhibits a protein target by noncovalent binding.
Once a lead compound is found, a number of its chemical derivatives
are synthesized to achieve high inhibition potency.18 Such inhibition is, however, reversible in most cases and,
therefore, inefficient.19 More efficient
inhibition of therapeutically significant targets can be achieved
by covalent20 or bivalent inhibitors.21−23 For example, apramer-based bivalent inhibitors demonstrated 16.6
times higher inhibition of thrombin than monovalent aprtamers.21

We have been developing a two component
(binary) system for highly
selective and efficient inactivation of DNA polymerases.24 In this concept, the enzyme is inactivated by
interacting with a reagent formed in the active site of the DNA polymerase
from two prereactive groups, one of which is located on the 3′
end of the primer, while the other is on incoming dNTP. Earlier, we
achieve selective covalent cross-linking and inactivation of DNA polymerases
by photoactive TCI.25−28 Importantly, nucleotide-detached prereactive groups did not trigger
DNA polymerase inactivation. However, light irradiation is not desirable
for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we took advantage of Cu-free
click chemistry to produce a two-component inhibitor of HIV RT, which
does not depend on light irradiation. We attached the azido and DBCO
functional group to dTTP analogues and incorporated one of the groups
into the 3′ end of the primer using HIV RT. Following the addition
of the second dTTP analogue resulted in formation of the “click”
product, which presumably inhibited HIV RT due to tight binding in
case when azido-functionality was added first. The inhibition mechanism
for the system with the DBCO functional group added first requires
further investigations as it cannot be explained by the click product
formation, which was not observed. In the presence of both analogues,
HIV RT was unable to synthesize DNA even upon the addition of the
access amount of DNA substrate, thus indicating an irreversible inhibition
mode.

We demonstrated the feasibility of inhibiting HIV RT using
a bivalent
inhibitor composed of azido and DBCO components attached to nonchain
terminating dTTP analogues. We hypothesize that the approach can be
used as new in vivo HIV RT inhibitors. To adapt this approach of in
vivo inhibition of HIV RT, it is easy to envision synthesis of chain-terminating
forms of DBCO and azido analogues. Incorporation of the first NRTI-click
chemistry component will terminate DNA synthesis followed by binding
of the second component, which will couple with the primer, thus locking
HIV RT in tightly bound unproductive complex in which both the RT
and viral primer–template are inactivated. This inactivation
scheme may become more efficient than currently used NRTIs.

Conclusions
We synthesized two dTTP analogues, one of each is conjugated in
an azido component and another with an alkyne component. When added
together (a two-component system), the two analogues strongly inhibited
HIV RT DNA polymerase activity. Unlike the state-of-the-art inhibitor
AZT, the inhibition effect was not recovered by the access amount
of primer–template, which suggests a stronger inhibitory effect.
The designed and tested two-component inhibitor promises to become
a more efficient inhibitor of HIV RT than conventional NRTIs and should
be tested in vivo.
