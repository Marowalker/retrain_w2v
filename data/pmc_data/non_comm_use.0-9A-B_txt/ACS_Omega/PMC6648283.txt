Many previous studies
have shown that (i) the oxidation of aniline
or the aniline dimer p-aminodiphenylamine (PADPA)
in a slightly acidic aqueous solution can be catalyzed with heme peroxidases
or multicopper laccases and that (ii) subsequent reactions lead to
oligomeric or polymeric products, which resemble chemically synthesized
polyaniline in its conductive emeraldine salt form (PANI-ES), provided
that (iii) an anionic “template” is present in the reaction
medium. Good templates are anionic polyelectrolytes, micelles, or
vesicles. Under optimal conditions, their presence directs the reactions
in a positive way toward the desired formation of PANI-ES-type products.
The effect of four different types of anionic templates on the formation
of PANI-ES-like products from PADPA was investigated and compared
by using Trametes versicolor laccase
(TvL) as a catalyst in an aqueous pH 3.5 solution at room temperature.
All four templates contain sulfonate groups: the sodium salt of the
polyelectrolyte sulfonated polystyrene (SPS), micelles from sodium
dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), vesicles from a 1:1 molar mixture
of SDBS and decanoic acid, and vesicles from sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate
(AOT). Although with all four templates, stable, inkjet-printable
solutions or suspensions consisting of PANI-ES-type products were
obtained under optimized conditions, considerably higher amounts of
TvL were required with SDBS micelles to achieve comparable monomer
conversion to PANI-ES-like products during the same time period when
compared to those with SPS or the two types of vesicles. This makes
SDBS micelles less attractive as templates for the investigated reaction.
In situ UV/vis/near-infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR),
and Raman spectroscopy measurements in combination with an high-performance
liquid chromatography analysis of extracted reaction products, which
were deprotonated and chemically reduced, showed seemingly small but
significant differences in the composition of the mixtures obtained
when reaching reaction equilibrium after 24 h. With the two vesicle
systems, the content of unwanted substituted phenazine units was lower
than in the case of SPS polyelectrolyte and SDBS micelles. The EPR
spectra indicate a more localized, narrower distribution of electronic
states of the paramagnetic centers of the PANI-ES-type products synthesized
in the presence of the two vesicle systems when compared to that of
the similar products obtained with the SPS polyelectrolyte and SDBS
micelles as templates. Overall, the data obtained from the different
complementary methods indicate that with the two vesicle systems structurally
more uniform (regular) PANI-ES-type products formed. Among the two
investigated vesicle systems, for the investigated reaction (oxidation
of PADPA with TvL and O2), AOT appears a somewhat better
choice as it leads to a higher content of the PANI-ES polaron form.

1 Introduction
The
efficient and environmentally friendly enzymatic synthesis
of polyaniline products in their conductive emeraldine salt form (PANI-ES)
has been a scientific challenge for many research groups during the
last years.1−29 The reasons for this are the many possible applications of conductive
polyaniline,30−34 even for biomedical applications (for example, in tissue engineering).35,36 Due to the polymeric nature of PANI-ES products and their insolubility
in common solvents,37 independent of whether
they are obtained through electrochemical,33 chemical,33,38 enzymatic, or enzyme-mimicking39,40 routes, the analysis of the chemical structure of PANI-ES-type products
is often difficult or impossible. By using p-aminodiphenylamine
(PADPA) instead of aniline, the situation in terms of product analysis
is much better.19,21−23

Based
on our previous detailed investigations of the Trametes
versicolor laccase (TvL)/O2-catalyzed
oxidative oligomerization of PADPA (Scheme 1) in the presence of 100 nm sized vesicles
from sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT, Chart 1) as “templates”
at pH 3.5 (0.1 M NaH2PO4),19−22 we questioned whether other templates
with sulfonate groups can also be used successfully for the same reaction,
and if yes, how the outcome of the reaction compares with the one
using AOT vesicles. By the term “template”, we mean
an additive that has a desired influence on the outcome of a chemical
or enzymatic reaction in terms of chemical structure so that the structure
is “dictated” by the template molecules.15,41−53 For the particular case investigated, the desired reaction products
should resemble PANI-ES (Scheme 1).19,54 The templates chosen for the
comparison with AOT vesicles were vesicles formed from a 1:1 molar
mixture of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and decanoic acid
(DA), SDBS micelles, and the sodium salt of the polyelectrolyte sulfonated
polystyrene (often abbreviated as SPS). For the chemical structures
of the template-forming molecules, see Chart 1. SDBS micelles were already applied for
the Trametes hirsuta laccase/O2-catalyzed oligomerization of PADPA by Shumakovich et al.,8 and all four templates were previously used for
the enzymatic polymerization of aniline: SPS polyelectrolyte,1−3 SDBS micelles,3,4,6,27 SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles,13 and AOT vesicles.14,16,17 In all of these previous cases, the aim was to obtain products with
spectroscopic properties that are characteristic for the linear conductive
form of PANI-ES: (i) they must have a green color with high absorption
in the near-infrared (NIR) region, at about 800–1000 nm or
above, and they must have an absorption band at about 420 nm due to
the formation of polarons (radical cations) for which the templates
act as counter ions (dopants);33,55−58 (ii) they must have a low absorption at about 500–600 nm
since this is indicative of a low extent of branching2 or undesired phenazine-type structural unit formation;23 (iii) they must have characteristic Raman bands
originating from C–N•+ stretching vibrations
of polaronic structures (at about 1320–1380 cm–1);20,22,33,59 and (iv) they must be paramagnetic due to the polarons,
i.e., an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum should be
measurable.18,58,60,61

consisting of anionic groups A–, promote the formation
of PANI-ES.

Different Isomers),13,62,63 Decanoic Acid (DA), and Sulfonated Polystyrene (SPS, as Sodium Salt,
Assuming a Sulfonation Level of 100%;64−66Mw = 70 000 Da, n ≈ 330)
In a previous investigation
by Liu et al.,3 the effect of different
templates on the horseradish peroxidase/H2O2-mediated polymerization of aniline was compared;
it was found that the use of SDBS micelles or SPS polyelectrolyte
was an improvement over cationic, nonionic, or other anionic templates
(bearing carboxylate or phosphate groups).3 We now report about a comparison of template effects on a related
enzymatic reaction, the TvL/O2-mediated oligomerization
of the aniline dimer PADPA, by using different sulfonate-group-bearing
templates only. The focus was set on a comparison of the template
type, i.e., polyelectrolyte versus micelles versus vesicles. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic approach for such
comparison, although Zhang et al.29 already
reported about a comparison of the Aspergillus laccase/O2-mediated polymerization of aniline in the presence of a micellar
template (SDBS) or of a polyelectrolyte (ligninosulfonate). The use
of ligninosulfonate was shown to have advantages over SDBS micelles.29 Furthermore, de Salas et al.27 used a high-potential laccase engineered and expressed
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the
oxidative polymerization of aniline in the presence of an anionic
template (either AOT vesicles, SDBS micelles, or sodium lauryl ether
sulfate micelles); SDBS micelles were found to be superior.27

The use of PADPA as a monomer instead
of aniline has both benefits
and drawbacks. The main reaction products are PADPA oligomers only,19,21,22 which is a disadvantage if one
aims at synthesizing polymeric molecules. However, at the same time,
it is also an advantage since PADPA oligomers (in their neutral form)
can be extracted from the reaction mixture into an organic solvent,
separated chromatographically, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry
(MS).19,21,22 With such
analysis, it could be shown that the presence of AOT vesicles in the
case of the TvL/O2-catalyzed oligomerization of PADPA completely
suppresses the formation of undesired side products that contain oxygen
atoms (which originate from the hydrolysis of reaction intermediates
if AOT vesicles are absent).21

Our
aim of comparing the effects of different types of templates
on the TvL/O2-catalyzed oligomerization of PADPA is apparently
an experimentally simple task. However, the choice of conditions under
which the comparison should actually be made is not straightforward.
It would be too simple, for example, to compare the AOT vesicle template
system with the SDBS micelle system using identical amphiphile concentrations
in both cases. AOT in 0.1 M NaH2PO4 solution
at pH 3.5, the optimal reaction conditions, forms bilayered vesicles
at a critical concentration for vesicle formation (cvc) of about 0.4
mM.14,67 On the other hand, SDBS in the same aqueous
solution forms micelles at a critical concentration for micelle formation
(cmc) that may be different from the cvc of AOT vesicles; vesicles
and micelles are different types of polymolecular assemblies. Literature
values for the cmc value of SDBS (a complex mixture of isomers)13,62,63 at 25 °C in water are 3.1,68 2.7–2.9,62 1.4–1.9,69,70 or 1.2 mM.71 Although the values deviate, possibly due to the different
sources of SDBS and the method of cmc determination, the cmc value
for SDBS in the pH 3.5 solution used (0.1 M NaH2PO4) is expected to be lower than the cmc value determined in
deionized water;72 see Section 3. SPS, for which we assume
that it is sulfonated in each repeating unit,64−66 is a macromolecule
and as such has not much in common with a vesicle. Based on these
considerations, we decided to first optimize for each of the three
new templates, SPS, SDBS micelles, and SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, the
reaction conditions but keeping (i) the aqueous solution the same,
0.1 M NaH2PO4 (pH = 3.5, prepared from NaH2PO4 and phosphoric acid),22 (ii) the PADPA concentration the same (1.0 mM), and (iii) the TvL
concentration the same (2.6 nM). These are the conditions that we
found to be ideal for a reproducible reaction with 100 nm sized AOT
vesicles at an AOT concentration of 1.5 mM.22

The reaction optimizations for SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, SDBS
micelles,
and the SPS polyelectrolyte were carried out on the basis of the following
criteria (see also above). First, there should be no product precipitation
during and after the reaction, i.e., a stable solution or suspension
should result from the reaction. Second, the products should have
a high absorbance at ≈1000 nm (A≈1000), a band at ≈420 nm, and a low absorbance at ≈500
nm (A≈500). The reaction optimization
was performed by systematic UV/vis/NIR absorption measurements and
visual inspections (detection of precipitation). After identification
of the conditions we considered optimal for each template, direct
comparisons were made not only by detailed in situ UV/vis/NIR measurements
but also by in situ EPR and in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements,
as well as by an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–MS
analysis of the extracted, deprotonated, and chemically reduced reaction
products, and by tests of the inkjet-printability of the as-obtained
reaction solutions or suspensions. The aim of the HPLC–MS analysis
was to obtain comparative information about the PADPA conversion and
the product distribution.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials

orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%), and tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE, ≥99.0%) were purchased
from Fluka. Ammonia solution (25%) was purchased from Merck. Dodecylbenzensulfonic
acid sodium salt (SDBS, hard type, >95%) was purchased from TCI
Europe.
Dichloromethane (99.5%) was purchased from J.T. Baker. N-Phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (p-aminodiphenylamine,
PADPA, 98%) was from either Sigma-Aldrich or abcr GmbH, purified by
recrystallization from hexane, four to five times until white crystals
were obtained. All other chemicals were used as obtained.

2.2 Preparation of pH 3.5 Phosphate Solution and
PADPA Stock Solution
A pH 3.5 phosphate solution (0.1 M)
was prepared at room temperature (RT) by first dissolving 0.1 mol
of NaH2PO4 in deionized water to yield a total
volume of 1 L, followed by adjustment of the pH value with 1 M H3PO4 (and not HCl)22 until
pH 3.5. This solution is called “pH 3.5 solution”. A
stock solution of 0.15 M PADPA in ethanol was prepared by dissolving
13.8 mg of PADPA in 500 μL of ethanol. This solution was stored
in a refrigerator at T ≈ 7 °C and used
within 1 day.

2.3 Preparation of AOT Vesicles
Vesicle
suspensions of 20 mM AOT, consisting of mainly unilamellar vesicles
with an average diameter of about 100 nm, were prepared with the freeze–thaw/extrusion
method, as described before.14,16,21 The amount of 0.178 g of AOT (0.4 mmol) was dissolved in about 5
mL of chloroform. This AOT solution was added to a 250 mL round-bottom
glass flask, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to
form a thin AOT film, followed by high vacuum drying overnight. The
dry AOT film was then hydrated by slowly vortexing at RT with 20 mL
of the pH 3.5 solution. The obtained AOT vesicle suspension was frozen
by placing the round-bottom flask into liquid nitrogen and then thawed
in a water bath heated to 60 °C. This freezing–thawing
process was repeated 10 times. Afterward, the suspension was extruded
five times through a 200 nm Nuclepore polycarbonate membrane and then
10 times through a 100 nm membrane using the Extruder from Lipex Biomembranes
(Vancouver, Canada).73 The thus-prepared
vesicle suspensions were stored at RT and used within 3 weeks ([AOT]
= 20 mM, [NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M, pH = 3.5).

2.4 Preparation of SDBS/Decanoic
Acid (1:1) Vesicles
Vesicle suspensions of equimolar amounts
of SDBS and decanoic acid
(DA) were prepared with the freezing–thawing/extrusion method
as described before.13 The amounts of 0.1394
g of SDBS (0.4 mmol) and 0.0689 g of DA (0.4 mmol) were dissolved
in about 5 mL of chloroform and added to a 250 mL round-bottom glass
flask. The next steps were the same as described for the preparation
of AOT vesicles. The resulting SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicle suspension was
stored at RT and used within 3 weeks ([SDBS] = [DA] = 20 mM, [NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M, pH
= 3.5).

2.5 Preparation of SDBS Micelles
A 20
mM SDBS micellar solution was prepared at RT by dissolving 0.1394
g (0.4 mmol) of SDBS in 20 mL of pH = 3.5 solution. The micellar solution
was stored at RT and used within 1 month ([SDBS] = 20 mM, [NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M, pH
= 3.5).

The critical concentration for SDBS micelle formation
(cmc) was determined in the same way as described before.74 A methanolic stock solution of pinacyanol chloride
was first prepared by dissolving 1.36 mg of pinacyanol chloride (3.5
μmol) in 10 mL of methanol. A volume of 5 μL of this stock
solution was added to 0.6 mL of SDBS solution of defined concentration
(prepared in pH 3.5 solution), and the absorbance at 606 nm (A606) was measured with a Jasco V-670 UV/vis/NIR
spectrophotometer using a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette ([pinacyanol chloride]
= 2.9 μM). From a plot of A606 versus
molar SDBS concentration, the cmc value was taken as the SDBS concentration
at which the value of A606 started to
increase.

2.6 Preparation of SPS Polyelectrolyte Solution
SPS was dissolved in the pH 3.5 solution at 0.08248 g per 20 mL
of the pH 3.5 solution. The concentration of SPS repeating units,
[SPS r.u.], was calculated by taking into account the molar mass of
the r.u., M(NaC8H7SO3) = 206.19 g
mol–1. This polyelectrolyte solution was stored
at RT and used within 1 month ([SPS r.u.] = 20 mM, [NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M, pH = 3.5).

2.7 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Cryogenic
Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM) Measurements
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out with
Malvern Zetasizer Nano and disposable polystyrene microcuvettes (40
μL). The cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)
analysis was performed in the same way as described before.75

2.8 Preparation of Laccase
Stock Solution
A laccase stock solution was prepared as follows.22 The amount of 12.92 mg of laccase (TvL) powder
was first
added to a 1.5 mL polypropylene Eppendorf tube. Afterward, 1.0 mL
deionized water was added and the tube was slowly agitated. The solution
was centrifuged with Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 D (6000 rpm, 2 min).
Afterward, the supernatant solution was diluted 1:9 (v/v) with deionized
water and the molar concentration of active TvL was estimated as described
before.19 This diluted solution yielded
[TvL] ≈ 1.6 μM and was kept in the refrigerator at T ≈ 7 °C and used within 1 week.

2.9 Laccase Activity and Stability in the Presence
of Templates
The activity of TvL was measured spectrophotometrically
with 0.25 mM ABTS2– as the substrate in the pH 3.5
solution at RT, as described before.19 A
Cary 1E spectrophotometer (from Varian) and 1.5 mL quartz cuvettes
with a path length of 1 cm were used. The assay solution was prepared
by first adding 935 μL of a pH 3.5 solution to the cuvette.
Afterward, 50 μL of an ABTS2– stock solution
(5 mM in pH 3.5 solution) was added, finally followed by 15 μL
of a TvL solution containing a defined amount of one of the templates,
stored for a desired period of time (2.6 nM TvL). After gentle mixing,
the solution was incubated for (t) 7 min and the
increase of A414, originating from the
formation of ABTS•–, was measured for 3 min
at RT. The relative TvL activity is expressed as ΔA414/Δt (h–1).

2.10 Reaction Mixtures
All reactions
were carried out in volumes of 10 mL within 50 mL Schott glass bottles,
closed with a screw cap. Defined volumes of the different separately
prepared stock solutions were added in the following sequence: (a)
pH 3.5 solution; (b) template stock solution; (c) PADPA stock solution;
and (d) TvL stock solution. After mixing by gentle agitation (set
to reaction time t = 0), the reaction mixtures were
left standing in the closed bottles at RT until the screw cap was
removed for withdrawing a portion of the reaction mixtures for analysis
by one of the methods. Details about the various volumes of the stock
solutions used for the four different template systems (i–iv)
are given in Table S-1 for each of the
elaborated optimal conditions (always [PADPA] = 1.0 mM, pH = 3.5)
([NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] =
0.1 M): (i) [AOT] = 1.5 mM, [TvL] = 2.6 nM; (ii) [SDBS] = [DA] = 1.0
mM, [TvL] = 2.6 nM; (iii) [SDBS] = 1.7 mM, [TvL] = 2.6 or 26 nM; (iv)
[SPS r.u.] = 2.9 mM, [TvL] = 2.6 nM.

2.11 UV/Vis/NIR
Spectroscopy Measurements
In situ UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy
measurements were carried out with
a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer. Volumes of 0.3 mL were withdrawn
from the reaction mixtures at desired time points. The absorption
spectrum was recorded from 1500 to 190 nm using quartz cuvettes (path
length: 0.1 cm, volume: 0.3 mL).

2.12 EPR
Spectroscopy Measurements
In
situ EPR spectroscopy measurements were carried out with a Bruker
EMX X-band spectrometer equipped with a TM cavity in the same way
as described before.22

2.13 Raman Spectroscopy Measurements
In situ Raman spectroscopy
measurements were carried out with a DXR
Raman microscope (Thermo Scientific), equipped with a research optical
microscope and a charge-coupled device detector. A HeNe gas laser
was used with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm, as described before.20,22 The Raman spectra of the reaction products were recorded from 2000
to 300 cm–1 without interrupting the ongoing reactions
and without isolation of the reaction products, i.e., in situ, by
withdrawing aliquots of 5 μL volume from the same reaction mixture
at specified reaction times and transferring them into sample wells
at the sample slide (Gold EZ-Spot Micro Mount sample slide, from Thermo
Scientific). Each spectrum was measured for a new aliquot taken from
the reaction mixture at the specified time and transferred into the
empty and clean sample well. The slide with the sample of the reaction
mixtures was placed on an X–Y motorized sample stage, and the laser beam was focused on the sample
using an objective magnification of 10×. The scattered light
was analyzed by the spectrograph with a 600 lines mm–1 grating. The laser power on the sample was kept at 5.0 mW (when
SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, SDBS micelles, and the SPS polyelectrolyte
were used as templates) or 4.0 mW (in the case of AOT vesicles). The
spectra were recorded using 10 s exposure time and 10 exposures per
spectrum. All Raman spectra are shown after automated fluorescence
correction performed by OMNIC software (Thermo Scientific).

2.14 HPLC Measurements
The ex situ HPLC
analysis of the reaction products was carried in exactly the same
way as described before.21,22

2.15 Test of Inkjet-Printability
The
as-obtained reaction mixtures were tested for their inkjet-printability
on ordinary white paper (XEROX Business, 80 g m–2) using a thermal desktop inkjet printer (Hewlett Packard Deskjet
980cxi; 600 × 600 dpi; DIN A4 format) in the same way as described
before.17 Each pattern was overprinted
for a total of eight passes at the same place to increase the amount
of deposited reaction mixture.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characteristics of the
Different Templates
Used
Aqueous pH 3.5 suspensions or solutions of the four
templates used, extruded AOT or SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, SDBS micelles,
and the polyelectrolyte SPS, were analyzed in terms of average size
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) at room temperature (Figure 1A). As expected,13,14 the vesicles had sizes of about 100 nm (hydrodynamic diameter, Dh), whereas the SDBS micelles were shown to
be much smaller (Dh ≈ 6 nm). Cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) measurements confirmed
the presence of vesicles in the two vesicle suspensions. The detected
vesicles were spherical and mainly unilamellar with sizes in the expected
range (Figure 1B,C).
For the SDBS micelles and SPS polyelectrolyte samples, cryo-TEM did
not show any features that could be assigned to micelles or polyelectrolytes
(Figure S-1). The cvc values for the AOT
vesicle system were determined previously under comparable conditions,
(≈0.4 mM);14 for the SDBS/DA (1:1)
vesicles, the cvc is expected to be similar. Determinations of the
cmc value for SDBS micelles with pinacyanol chloride yielded ≈0.3
mM (Figure 1D).

of the four templates used (pH = 3.5, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 25 °C). (A) DLS analysis: mean diameters
(±standard deviations from the analysis of three samples each)
were for the AOT vesicles, 110 ± 3 nm (PDI = 0.19, 20 mM AOT),
for the SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, 96 ± 2 nm (PDI = 0.16, 20 mM
SDBS, 20 mM DA), for the SDBS micelles, 6.2 ± 0.1 nm (PDI = 0.19,
20 mM SDBS), and for the SPS polyelectrolyte, 13.1 ± 0.2 nm (PDI
= 0.24, 20 mM repeating units). Note that the value for SPS has to
be taken with caution since it is likely that nonspherical clusters
form, which would require a more extensive DLS analysis for meaningful
values of the size.76 PDI means polydispersity
index. (B, C) Cryo-TEM analysis of the AOT vesicles (10 mM AOT) and

(D) Determination of the cmc of SDBS with pinacyanol chloride (2.9
μM) in the pH 3.5 solution (■), yielding a value of ≈0.3
mM. For comparison, measurements were also made for SDBS dissolved
in deionized water (○), indicating that cmc (SDBS) in water
is greater than 1.0 mM.62,68−70 (E) Schematic representation of the likely state of the four templates
at the conditions used for the enzymatic reaction investigated: SPS
(as dynamic clusters of SPS chains),76−78 SDBS micelles, SDBS/DA
(1:1) vesicles, and AOT vesicles.

The DLS analysis of the SPS solution gave an average value
of the
hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of about 13
nm (Figure 1A). Although
we did not further examine the state of SPS (average Mw = 70 000 Da) in the pH 3.5 phosphate solution
used, it is likely that SPS in aqueous salt solution “clusters
dynamically” (meaning “temporal aggregate formation”).76−78 This is schematically shown in Figure 1E, where for the sake of completeness schematic
representations of SDBS micelles, SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, and AOT
vesicles are given. A common feature of all four templates is that
they all are soft, dispersed interface-rich systems79 bearing negatively charged hydrophilic soluble sulfonate
groups, which are exposed to the aqueous bulk solution.

3.2 Optimal Conditions for the Laccase/O2-Catalyzed Oxidation
of PADPA in the Presence of SDBS/DA (1:1) Vesicles,
SDBS Micelles, or SPS Polyelectrolyte
As already pointed
out in Section 1, in
our previous report on the TvL/O2-catalyzed oligomerization
of PADPA in the presence of extruded AOT vesicles, the following initial
conditions were shown to be optimal: 1.5 mM AOT, 1.0 mM PADPA, 2.6
nM TvL, pH = 3.5 (0.1 M NaH2PO4/H3PO4, no chloride ions), t = 24 h, and T ≈ 25 °C (RT).22 For a comparison with the other three templates, SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles,
SDBS micelles, and SPS polyelectrolyte, we decided to keep the phosphate
solution (pH = 3.5, 0.1 M NaH2PO4/H3PO4, chloride free), the PADPA concentration (1.0 mM),
and also the TvL concentration (2.6 nM) the same. Furthermore, we
aimed to reach reaction equilibrium after t ≤
24 h at a reaction temperature of T ≈ 25 °C
(RT). We then searched for the optimal conditions by varying the template
molecule concentrations and applying the same criteria as in our previous
work with AOT vesicles;22 see Section 1: (i) high absorption
at λ ≈ 1000 nm (A1000) after t = 24 h with a high A≈1000/A≈500 ratio, both indicative
of the formation of products with a high content of linear PANI-ES
repeating units (as the band at around 500 nm is typical for the formation
of undesired substituted phenazine-type structures,22,23 whereas the band at around 1000 nm is due to ordinary PANI-ES structures)33,55−58 and (ii) no precipitation during and at the end of the reaction.
With this concept, the following conditions were found to be optimal
for the three “new” templates.(a) For SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles: [SDBS]
= [DA] = 1.0 mM, with characteristic absorption maxima at λ
≈ 1100 and 440 nm. For [SDBS] = [DA] < 0.9 mM, precipitation
occurred, and for [SDBS] = [DA] > 1.0 mM, A≈1000 and A≈420 were
lower than for
[SDBS] = [DA] = 1.0 mM (Figure S-2A).

(b) For SDBS micelles, we
considered [SDBS]
= 1.7 mM as good conditions, with absorption bands at λ ≈
930 and 410 nm. For [SDBS] < 1.1 mM, precipitation occurred, and
for [SDBS] > 1.8 mM, A≈1000 and A≈420 were lower than for [SDBS] = 1.7
mM (Figure S-2B).

(c) For SPS, there was a broad concentration
range that produced very similar UV/vis/NIR spectra after a reaction
time of t = 24 h (Figure S-2C). There was, however, a slight increase in A≈1000/A≈500 when
the concentration of SPS r.u., [SPS r.u.], was increased from 1.4
to 3.4 mM, whereas A≈1000 and A≈420 remained almost constant between
1.3 and 2.9 mM, followed by a decrease for [SPS] > 2.9 mM (Figure S-2C). Based on this, we considered [SPS]
= 2.9 mM as the optimal concentration.



3.3 Changes of the UV/Vis/NIR Spectra of the Reaction
Mixtures Measured in Situ during the Reactions
For each of
the four template systems, the reaction was run under the evaluated
optimal reaction conditions, and the UV/vis/NIR spectra of the reaction
mixtures were measured at predetermined times, up to t = 14 days (Figure 2). The changes in the absorption at the band maxima in the NIR region
of the spectra (A≈1000; assigned
to the π → polaron transition)57 and at A≈420 (assigned to the
polaron → π* transition)57 are compared for all four reactions in Figure 3. From Figure 2, it is clear that in all cases the expected bands
at λ ≈ 1000 and 420 nm develop with reaction time and
that the absorption at λ ≈ 500 nm remains low. Although
spectral differences to some extent may be due to differences in the
size of the templates (turbidity in the case of vesicle suspensions),
see the DLS data of Figure 1A, there are distinct differences between the groups of spectra,
which must originate from differences in the chemical structures of
the actual product mixture obtained. The two vesicle systems yield
very similar spectra and a very similar time-dependent evolution of
the spectra with λmax ≈ 1070 nm (for AOT)
and λmax ≈ 1100 nm (for SDBS/DA (1:1), Figure 2A,B). The spectra
shown for the reaction run in the presence of AOT vesicles (Figure 2A) resemble closely
the spectra that we recorded previously for the same reaction (Figure
2A in ref (22)). This
indicates high reproducibility despite the complexity of the reaction
(see below). For the reactions with the micellar and polyelectrolyte
templates (Figure 2C,D), the spectra are different. The absorption maxima in the NIR
region of the spectrum were located at 930 nm (for SDBS micelles)
and 950 nm (for the SPS polyelectrolyte), respectively. For the micellar
system, the absorption in the NIR region clearly originates from several
absorption bands, which sum up in a very characteristic band shape
(sharp absorption increase at about 850 nm with an increase in wavelength).
A very similar spectrum was reported previously by Shumakovich et
al.8 for the oxidation of PADPA in the
presence of SDBS micelles at pH = 3.8 with T. hirsuta laccase.8 For this micellar system, significant
spectral changes occur well beyond t = 1 day; in
other words, the reaction is much slower compared to the reaction
with the vesicles (Figure 3). In the presence of the polyelectrolyte SPS, the reaction
yields products with λmax ≈ 950 nm and strongest
intensity after t = 5 h (Figure 2D). For t > 5 h, A950 decreases with a considerable broadening
of the band toward higher as well as lower wavelengths. During the
complex spectral changes above λ ≈ 500 nm, A≈420 remained fairly constant (Figure 3B).

Figure 2 Changes of the UV/vis/NIR
spectra of the four different reaction
mixtures, as measured for samples withdrawn during the reactions.
The templates used were AOT vesicles (A, [AOT] = 1.5 mM), SDBS/DA
(1:1) vesicles (B, [SDBS] = [DA] = 1.0 mM), SDBS micelles (C, [SDBS]
= 1.7 mM), and the SPS polyelectrolyte (D, [SPS r.u.] = 2.9 mM). [PADPA]0 = 1.0 mM, [TvL] = 2.6 nM, pH = 3.5 ([NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M), and T ≈ 25 °C. For experimental details, see Section 2.

Figure 3 Time-dependent changes of A≈420 (A) and A≈1000 (B) for the four
different reaction mixtures, as determined from the recorded UV/vis/NIR
spectra shown in Figure 2. The data taken for the reaction with AOT vesicles are A420 and A1070, with SDBS/DA
(1:1) vesicles are A430 and A1100, with SDBS micelles are A410 and A930, and with the SPS polyelectrolyte
are A410 and A950.

In summary, the in situ UV/vis/NIR
measurements indicate that the
template type has a significant influence on the kinetics of the reaction
and on the absorption spectra of the products obtained. It seems that
the template effect of the two vesicle systems is distinctly different
from the template effect of the polyelectrolyte, and it is obvious
that the reaction in the presence of SDBS micelles is very slow. After t = 1 day and later, the highest A≈1000 and A≈420 values
are observed for the system with AOT vesicles, indicating the highest
content of the PANI-ES-polaron form obtained with this template from
PADPA with TvL and O2 (Figure 3).

3.4 Changes of the EPR Spectra
of the Reaction
Mixtures Measured in Situ during the Reactions
The four reactions
were also analyzed by EPR spectroscopy measurements up to a reaction
time of t = 7 days (Figures 4 and 5). With all
templates, centers with unpaired electrons form with time, whereby
their content initially increases and then levels off. Formation of
radicals is expected if products with PANI-ES units in the polaron
state are obtained (Scheme 1). For the two vesicle systems and for the SPS polyelectrolyte,
a stable radical content is achieved after t = 1
day. In the case of SDBS micelles, the radical content formation is
much slower, correlating with the slow increase in A≈1000; see Figure 3. Although the integral of the EPR signal after reaching
saturation was about the same for the two vesicle systems and for
the SPS polyelectrolyte (Figure 5), in the latter case, the EPR signal was much broader
(compare Figure 4A,B
with Figure 4D). Nevertheless,
among the four template systems, for t = 1 day and
later, the radical content is highest for the mixture with AOT vesicles
(Figure 5). SDBS micelles
as a template also resulted in a broad EPR signal (Figure 4C), which developed more slowly
than with the other three. Integrals obtained from spectra of chemically
similar samples with reproducible sample positioning in the spectrometer
are a reliable quantitative tool to compare their relative radical
content.

Figure 4 Changes of the EPR spectra of the four different reaction mixtures,
as measured for samples withdrawn during the reactions. For the conditions,
see the legend of Figure 2.

Figure 5 Time-dependent changes of the integral of the
EPR signal for the
four different reaction mixtures, as determined from the recorded
EPR spectra shown in Figure 4.

In summary, the in situ EPR measurements
qualitatively and quantitatively
confirm the results of the in situ UV/vis/NIR measurements with respect
to the kinetics and yields of the reaction, with good correlation
between EPR signal intensity (integral) and A≈1000. Interestingly, the fundamental type of radical
formed at saturation of the reaction appears to be similar for all
systems (Figure 4),
with a variation in Landé g-factor of only
0.0003. However, the EPR line width differs significantly between
products obtained in the presence of SPS or SDBS micelles compared
with the two vesicle systems. The observed differences originate most
likely from the regularity of the chemical environment in which the
paramagnetic centers are embedded. This regularity concerns the oligomer/polymer
as well as the template. We conclude that vesicles with their fairly
ordered membrane help to produce a rather uniform oligomer/polymer
and keep it aligned in the matrix they represent. This results in
a narrow distribution of electronic states in their paramagnetic centers,
causing sharper EPR bands than in the case of products obtained with
the polyelectrolyte or micelle template. The latter apparently is
not able to impose structural regularity on the oligomers/polymers.

3.5 Effect of Template Type on the Activity and
Stability of TvL as Measured with ABTS2–
If stored at RT in the pH 3.5 solution at [TvL] = 2.6 nM under the
same conditions used for the reaction with PADPA (50 mL flasks, 10
mL reaction volume), the activity of laccase drops within 5 h to about
50% of its initial value measured immediately after preparing the
solution; after 24 h, ≈10% of the initial activity could be
measured (Figure 6).
This indicates that the enzyme is not very stable in such dilute solution.
The presence of AOT vesicles (1.5 mM AOT) has no significant influence
on the stability of TvL. In contrast, the TvL activity was very low
in the presence of SDBS micelles (1.7 mM SDBS), even for the measurements
that were done immediately after adding TvL to the SDBS solution (time
1 min) (Figure 6).
A similar situation was found for SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles ([SDBS] =
[DA] = 1.0 mM), although the activity decrease was not that dramatic
(Figure 6). For the
SPS polyelectrolyte, the TvL activity also decreased significantly
with storage time (Figure 6). Although these TvL storage stability measurements may not
reflect the operational stability of TvL, i.e., the activity change
in the presence of PADPA,19 it at least
explains qualitatively why the TvL/O2-catalyzed oxidation
and oligomerization of PADPA in the presence of SDBS micelles are
much slower compared with the reaction with the other three templates
(Figures 3 and 5). Therefore, for the following investigations we
did not consider SDBS micelles as a template anymore for the low concentration
of TvL (2.6 nM) and only compared the two vesicle systems and the
SPS polyelectrolyte. However, later on, we reconsidered SDBS micelles
using a 10 times higher TvL concentration (26 nM); see below.

Figure 6 Relative activity
and stability of TvL dissolved at [TvL] = 2.6
nM and T ≈ 25 °C in pH = 3.5 solution
([NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] =
0.1 M) in the presence of either AOT vesicles (●, [AOT] = 1.5
mM), SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles (▲, [SDBS] = [DA] = 1.0 mM), SDBS
micelles (▼, [SDBS] = 1.7 mM), or the SPS polyelectrolyte (◆,
[SPS r.u.] = 2.9 mM). For comparison, TvL dissolved in the pH 3.5
solution without any added template was also analyzed (■).
The activity was measured with 0.25 mM ABTS2– as
the substrate at pH = 3.5 (l = 1.0 cm); see Section 2. The activity is
expressed as change in A414 (ΔA414), indicative of the formation of ABTS•–, per time unit (Δt)
measured. Average values and standard deviations from three separately
prepared samples are plotted for each condition.

3.6 Reproducibility for the Reactions in the Presence
of AOT Vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1) Vesicles, or SPS Polyelectrolyte as
Templates
Since the reaction mixtures investigated are heterogeneous
and consist of (i) fluid and dynamic polymolecular assemblies (vesicles
or micelles) or dynamically clustering polyelectrolytes,76−78 (ii) enzyme molecules with low storage stability, (iii) O2 as reoxidant of the enzyme, and (iv) PADPA monomers that have a
low water solubility, the reproducibility of the experiments needs
to be addressed. Therefore, for each of the three conditions, we have
prepared three reaction mixtures in exactly the same way (see Section 2), and after a reaction
time of t = 24 h at T ≈ 25
°C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by in situ UV/vis/NIR
and in situ EPR spectroscopy measurements. The results are shown in Figure 7. Good reproducibility
was observed for AOT vesicles, in agreement with our previous results,22 and for the SPS polyelectrolyte. In the case
of SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, there was considerable variation. The reason
for this is not clear. It may, however, originate from the more severe
TvL inhibition in the presence of this type of vesicles, as compared
with the AOT vesicles or SPS polyelectrolyte (Figure 6).

Figure 7 Reproducibility tests for the TvL/O2-catalyzed oxidation
and oligomerization of PADPA in the presence of either AOT vesicles
(A, B), SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles (C, D), or the SPS polyelectrolyte
(E, F). For each condition, three reactions were run with [TvL] =
2.6 nM at 25 °C for 24 h. Shown are the recorded in situ UV/vis/NIR
(A, C, E) and in situ EPR (B, D, F) spectra. For the reaction conditions,
see the legend of Figure 2.

3.7 Raman
Spectroscopy Measurements
The
three reaction mixtures containing either AOT vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1)
vesicles, or the SPS polyelectrolyte as templates were analyzed by
in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements after running the reactions
for 24 h at RT. In the case of SPS, the spectrum was also measured
after t = 5 h (Figure 8) since after 5 h of reaction in the presence of SPS,
the intensity of the peak in the NIR region of the absorption spectrum
was highest (see Figure 2). The Raman spectrum recorded for the AOT vesicle system shown in Figure 8 (top) is the same
as the one shown in Figure 5 of Kashima et al.22 The spectrum
is replotted here to allow an easier comparison among the different
template systems. The time-dependent changes in the Raman spectrum
for the reaction in the presence of AOT vesicles,22 SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, and the SPS polyelectrolyte recorded
during the reaction are shown in Figures S-3–S-5, respectively.

Figure 8 Analysis of reaction mixtures by in situ Raman spectroscopy
measurements
for the TvL/O2-catalyzed PADPA oxidation/oligomerization
reactions run either in the presence of AOT vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1)
vesicles, or the SPS polyelectrolyte as templates. The Raman spectra
were recorded after t = 24 h. For SPS, a measurement
was also made after t = 5 h. Excitation wavelength:
633 nm. For the reaction conditions, see the legend of Figure 2. For experimental details,
see Section 2.

At first glance, the spectra recorded
after t =
24 h (Figure 8) look
very similar for the three templates and contain the same main bands.
However, some differences exist. The Raman spectra of all reaction
systems for t = 24 h exhibit bands that are characteristic
of polyaniline in its conductive emeraldine salt form (PANI-ES). They
are positioned at 1623–1627 cm–1 (C∼C
stretching vibrations of benzenoid (B) rings, ν(C∼C)B, where “∼” denotes a bond intermediate
between the single and the double bond), 1592–1597 cm–1 (C=C and C∼C stretching vibrations of quinonoid (Q)
and semiquinonoid (SQ) rings, ν(C=C)Q and
ν(C∼C)SQ), 1510–1513 cm–1 (N–H bending vibration, δ(N–H)), 1351–1358
cm–1 with a shoulder at 1318–1330 cm–1 (C–N•+ stretching vibrations
in polaronic SQ structures, ν(C–N•+)SQ), and 1179–1189 cm–1 (C–H
bending in-plane vibrations of B rings, δ(C–H)B) with a shoulder at ≈1165 cm–1 (C–H
bending in-plane vibrations of SQ rings, δ(C–H)SQ) observed for systems with AOT vesicles and SDBS/decanoic acid vesicles
(Figure 8).38,80 Particularly indicative of a good electrical conductivity of the
obtained products is the strong “polaron band”, ν(C–N•+)SQ, observed in all Raman spectra, as
well as the shoulder at ≈1165 cm–1 observed
only for the systems with vesicles as templates. These features correlate
well with the strong band observed in the UV/vis/NIR spectra at 930–1100
nm (Figure 2). Besides
the mentioned bands, the spectra for the systems with SDBS/DA (1:1)
vesicles and the SPS polyelectrolyte exhibit a peak at about 1498
cm–1 (barely discernible for the system with AOT
vesicles), which can be assigned to the C=N stretching vibration
in Q rings (i.e., in quinonediimine units), ν(C=N)Q.38,80

Raman bands that are
not typical for ordinary PANI are also seen
in the spectra of the reaction products obtained in the presence of
the three different templates, recorded at t = 24
h (Figure 8). They
can be attributed to branched and phenazine-type structural units
and are seen at 1443–1454 cm–1 (attributable
to ring C=C stretching vibrations, possibly in short branches/short
chains and in substituted phenazine- and N-phenylphenazine-type
structures), 1408–1417 cm–1 (attributed to
phenazine-type units), and 1380 cm–1 (its origin
is still debatable, and it is attributable to ν(C–N+) vibrations in N-phenylphenazine units and/or
to ν(C–N•+) vibrations in localized
polaron sites).38 The appearance and positions
of these bands vary with the template type, indicating fine differences
in the molecular structure of the reaction products. They are seen
at following wavenumbers: 1443, 1417, and 1380 cm–1 for AOT vesicles; 1446, 1405, and 1380 cm–1 for
SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles; and at 1452 and 1410 cm–1 for the SPS polyelectrolyte.

The Raman spectra of the products
formed in the presence of SPS
as template recorded at t = 5 and 24 h are mutually
very similar. One observed difference, however, refers to the intensity
ratio of the bands that are atypical for PANI-ES, at about 1408 and
1453 cm–1: in the spectrum recorded at t = 5 h, the band at 1408 cm–1 is noticeably stronger
than the band at 1453 cm–1, whereas at t = 24 h, these two bands have similar intensities.

For the
in situ Raman spectra recorded during the reaction, before
reaction equilibrium was reached (Figures S-3–S-5), one of the important features is that the strong “phenazine
band” at around 1410 cm–1 appears already
at the early stage of the reaction (at t = 1 min)
and the relative intensity of this band decreases with the reaction
time for all three template systems. Another important observation
refers to the evolution of polaron band due to the ν(C–N•+)SQ vibration (at around 1350 cm–1, with a shoulder at ≈1320 cm–1) with reaction
time. The dynamics of the evolution of this band is different for
each template system. For example, the first spectrum at t = 1 min exhibits the ν(C–N•+)SQ band at around 1350 cm–1 as rather strong
one in the case of AOT vesicles (Figure S-3),22 whereas in the cases of SDBS/DA (1:1)
vesicles (Figure S-4) and the SPS polyelectrolyte
(Figure S-5), this band is weak at t = 1 min. For all three templates, the relative intensity
of the ν(C–N•+)SQ band increases
with reaction time and it becomes strong at t = 24
h, indicating an increase in the relative amount of polaron units,
i.e., the increase in the content of conductive PANI-ES-like structural
units.

3.8 HPLC Analysis
The three reaction
mixtures containing either AOT vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, or
the SPS polyelectrolyte were also analyzed with an HPLC method, which
we developed previously.21,22 In brief, with this
analysis, it is possible to get information about the extent of monomer
conversion (consumption of PADPA) and about the type of oligomeric
products formed in the reaction mixture. Since the HPLC analysis is
based on the chromatographic separation of extracted reaction products
that are first deprotonated for making them extractable and then chemically
reduced, no information about the oxidation and protonation states
of the as-formed products can be obtained. Nevertheless, the HPLC
analysis turned out to be very useful for analyzing the enzymatic
oxidation and oligomerization of PADPA, as a complementary method
to the in situ UV/vis/NIR, EPR, and Raman spectroscopy measurements.21−24

The chromatograms shown in Figure 9 were obtained from an HPLC analysis in which
a diode array detector was used. For the AOT vesicle system (Figure 9A), the data shown
are the same as in our previous work; see Figure 6A in Kashima et al.22 The analysis was made after a reaction time of t = 24 h. The peak pattern shown was reproducibly obtained by analyzing
independently prepared reaction mixtures of the same composition.22 For the SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles (Figure 9B), the chromatogram for t = 24 is very similar to the chromatogram for the AOT vesicle
system. For the SPS polyelectrolyte, a complete extraction of the
reaction products into tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE)
after a runtime of t = 24 h was not possible (most
likely due to a strong binding of SPS to the products or due to the
formation of insoluble products). In contrast, complete product extraction
was observed after t = 5 h, the reaction time at
which the band intensity at λ ≈ 1000 nm in the in situ
UV/vis/NIR absorption spectrum was highest (Figure 2D). The HPLC analysis of the products obtained
after t = 5 h in the presence of the SPS polyelectrolyte
showed that there is a great similarity in terms of peak pattern when
compared to that of the two vesicle systems (Figure 9A,B), the only difference being the relative
intensities of the peaks. For an HPLC analysis of the progress of
the reactions for all three templates, see Figure S-6. For a detailed assignment of the different peaks based
on an HPLC–MS analysis with partially deuterated PADPA monomers,
see Kashima et al.,22 and Table 1.

extracted and reduced products of the oxidation
of PADPA with TvL/O2 in the presence of either AOT vesicles

mM) (B); or the SPS polyelectrolyte ([SPS r.u.] = 2.9 mM) (C). For
all reaction mixtures, [TvL] ≈ 2.6 nM; [PADPA] = 1.0 mM; pH
= 3.5 ([NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M), and T ≈ 25 °C. Analysis
was performed after t = 24 h (for (A) and (B)) or t = 5 h (C). All products presented here were extracted
into MTBE.

Overall, the HPLC analysis
of the deprotonated and reduced reaction
products shows that the two vesicle systems gave very similar results
after t = 24 h (Figure 9A,B) and that in the case of SPS the product
distribution in the reaction is also very similar when analyzed after t = 5 h (Figure 9C). The main product is the linear aniline tetramer, (PADPA)2 (eluting after rt ≈ 32.7 min). Furthermore, linear
hexaaniline is formed, (PADPA)3 (eluting after rt ≈
39.5 min), as well as higher oligomers with phenazine units (eluting
at rt ≈ 56 min). The amount of remaining PADPA monomer, which
elutes at rt ≈ 19.5 min,22 was very
low. In the case of SPS, the difficulty of completely extracting the
products formed after a reaction time of t = 24 h
seems to be linked to the observation made with the in situ Raman
spectroscopy measurements; see Section 3.7 (Figure S-5). Spectral changes occur between t = 5 and 24 h
in Raman bands, which are atypical for PANI-ES and therefore undesired
(possible transformation of short branches into phenazine structures).

3.9 Test of the Inkjet-Printability of the PANI-ES
Suspensions Obtained with AOT Vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1) Vesicles, or
SPS Polyelectrolyte
All three reaction mixtures were tested
for their inkjet-printability on ordinary white paper by applying
a previously developed protocol.17 The
original black ink of a commercial thermal inkjet cartridge, after
modification to accommodate lower-surface-tension inks, was replaced
by a PANI-ES template suspension or solution. As a result, all three
reaction mixtures could be used as ink without any further pretreatment
(Figure 10). Consistent
and continual printing over many pages was possible, indicating small
and well-dispersed particles present in the reaction mixtures in all
cases. Neither clogging of the inkjet printer nozzles nor thermal
decomposition of the inks was observed. This is important for possible
applications of the as-obtained PANI-ES template dispersion or solutions.

mixtures obtained from the enzymatic oligomerization of PADPA in the
presence of either AOT vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, or the SPS

time of t = 24 h. For the composition, see the legend

3.10 Reconsidering
SDBS Micelles by Using a Significantly
Higher TvL Concentration
In the final part of this work,
we reconsidered the use of SDBS micelles as templates and tried to
apply a higher TvL concentration for achieving complete PADPA conversion.
All chosen conditions were the same: [SDBS] = 1.7 mM, [PADPA] = 1.0
mM, pH = 3.5 solution, and T ≈ 25 °C.
The concentration of TvL was varied between 2.6 and 26 nM. The UV/vis/NIR
spectra recorded after a reaction time of t = 24
h are shown in Figure 11. For [TvL] ≈ 2.6 nM, the spectrum is about the same as the
one shown in Figure 2D for t = 1 day, with λmax ≈
930 and 440 nm. For [TvL] = 26 nM, both band intensities were considerably
higher. For the reaction mixture at these “new SDBS micelle
conditions” with 26 nM TvL, we carried out the same analysis
as for the other three reaction mixtures and ≈2.6 nM TvL–AOT
vesicles, SDBS/DA (1:1) vesicles, and SPS polyelectrolyte; see Figure 12. The results obtained
can be summarized as follows. Although after a reaction time of t = 24 h high absorbance at λ ≈ 930 nm is reached,
the UV/vis/NIR spectrum continues to change with time up to at least t = 14 days with an increase in absorbance between 1100
and 1400 nm and a slight decrease in A≈930 (Figure 12A). The
EPR signal is always broad, and its intensity increases with reaction
time, even beyond t = 1 day (Figure 12B). The reproducibility of the measurements
is high (Figure 12C,D). The Raman spectrum recorded after t = 24 h
(Figure 12E) is very
similar to the Raman spectra of the reaction mixtures in the presence
of vesicles and polyelectrolyte templates at [TvL] = 2.6 nM. As discussed
in Section 3.7, bands
are also present at 1454 and 1394 cm–1, which are
atypical for PANI-ES and indicate the formation of structure units
containing substituted phenazines and branches. For SDBS micelles
as templates, the relative intensity of the band at 1394 cm–1 at t = 24 h is much higher (Figure S-7) compared to that of the spectra of the products
obtained with the other three templates at t = 24
h, at the same TvL concentration (Figures S-3–S-5). The time-dependent changes in the Raman spectrum are shown in Figure S-7. Similar to the case of AOT vesicles,
the polaron band due to the ν(C–N•+)SQ vibration at 1350 cm–1 is rather
strong already after t = 1 min. The HPLC data (Figures 12F and S-8) are very similar to the ones shown for the
other templates and 2.6 nM TvL conditions. Finally, the inkjet-printability
of the SDBS reaction mixture obtained with 26 nM TvL after T = 24 h has been confirmed (Figure 12G). Overall, it can be concluded that a
much higher TvL concentration is needed for the system with SDBS micelles
to achieve high monomer conversion and similar characteristics of
PADPA oligomeric products within 24 h compared to that needed for
the systems with the other three templates (2.6 nM).

Figure 11 Effect of TvL concentration
on the in situ UV/vis/NIR spectrum
of the reaction products obtained from the enzymatic oligomerization
of PADPA in the presence of SDBS micelles as templates. The reaction
was carried out at [SDBS] = 1.7 mM, [PADPA] = 1.0 mM, pH = 3.5 ([NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M), and T ≈ 25 °C; and [TvL] varying between 2.6 and 26 nM. For
all TvL concentrations, characteristic peaks appeared at λ ≈
930 and 410 nm. For experimental details, see Section 2.

The reaction was carried out at [SDBS] = 1.7 mM, [PADPA] = 1.0 mM,
pH = 3.5 ([NaH2PO4] + [H3PO4] = 0.1 M), [TvL]
≈ 26 nM, and T ≈ 25 °C. For experimental
details, see Section 2. (A) Time-dependent changes in the in situ UV/vis/NIR absorption
spectrum; (B) time-dependent changes in the in situ EPR spectrum;
(C, D) reproducibility test for three separately prepared reaction
mixtures with identical composition and a reaction time of t = 24 h; (E) in situ Raman spectrum of the reaction mixture
for t = 24 h; (F) HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture
after t = 24 h; (G) test of inkjet-printability.

4 Conclusions
In a follow-up work of our previous investigations of the TvL/O2-catalyzed oxidation and oligomerization of PADPA in the presence
of AOT vesicles as templates for obtaining conductive PANI-ES-type
products,19−22 we have made a comparison of the same reaction but with SDBS/DA
(1:1) vesicles, SDBS micelles, or the SPS polyelectrolyte as templates.
For the optimized conditions used, the products obtained with the
two vesicle templates have more in common than the products of the
reactions in the presence of SPS polyelectrolyte or SDBS micelles.
In the case of the micelles, the reaction is much slower than with
the other templates. In the presence of SPS polyelectrolyte, the oxidation
and oligomerization of PADPA are initially rapid, but the UV/vis/NIR
spectrum then becomes unstable and exhibits a broad peak and a decrease
of absorbance at around 1000 nm. We conclude that vesicle template
systems, like SDBS/DA (1:1) and AOT, are superior in producing PANI-ES-type
materials with the desired stable properties. Especially, AOT vesicles
foster formation of desired PANI-ES-type products with excellent reproducibility.

Products obtained with SDBS micelles and the SPS polyelectrolyte
show extremely broad EPR signals, indicating poor uniformity of radical
centers. Complementary in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements are
in good agreement with the UV/vis/NIR and EPR measurements. PANI-ES-type
products in stable suspensions can be obtained as dominant products
with all four investigated templates under carefully specified reaction
conditions. Furthermore, all suspensions are inkjet-printable. However,
the choice of the template, especially regarding its shape and size,
affects kinetics and product quality. SDBS micelles are least attractive,
whereas the SPS polyelectrolyte can compete with vesicles in kinetics
but not with product properties. If a high content of the conducting,
ordinary PANI-ES polaron form in the products is to be achieved, AOT
vesicles are the templates of choice.
