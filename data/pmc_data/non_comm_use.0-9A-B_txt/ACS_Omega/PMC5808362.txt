Chemical modifications of 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) and locked nucleic
acid (LNA) of the nucleotides in the seed region (positions 2–8)
of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) guide strand significantly reduced
seed-matched (SM) off-target effects. The siRNA with 2′-OMe
modifications inhibited the expression of a completely-matched (CM)
target gene, whereas that with LNA modifications did not inhibit the
expression of the CM target. By computational predictions of conformational
changes of siRNA by these modifications, we revealed that both modifications
in the siRNA seed region reduce SM off-target effects by steric hindrance
to base-pairing with target transcripts but LNA modifications also
disturb the association of the siRNA guide strand with the Argonaute
(AGO) protein by altering RNA conformation. Thus, chemical modifications
of the siRNA guide strand, which alter steric conformation to disturb
base-pairing with target transcripts but do not disturb the association
with the AGO protein, may successfully suppress off-target effects
without substantial loss of RNA silencing activity.

Introduction
RNA interference (RNAi)
is a prominent tool for functional genomics
because small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can effectively knock down
the target genes with perfect sequence complementarity to the siRNA.
siRNAs are double-stranded RNAs, 21 nucleotides (nts) in length with
2 nt 3′ overhangs (Figure 1). When an siRNA is transfected into cells, it is incorporated
into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which includes the
core protein Argonaute (AGO), and this process is referred to as RISC
loading. Subsequently, the siRNA is unwound into single-stranded RNAs.
Then, one RNA strand (guide strand) remains associated with AGO to
form active RISC, whereas the other strand (passenger strand) is degraded.1 The guide strand forms complete base-pairing
with a target transcript, and AGO cleaves the target to suppress its
function.2

Figure 1 Schematic presentation of the siRNA-mediated
RNAi pathway and off-target
pathways. RNAi is induced by the completely complementary siRNA guide
strand, and seed-dependent off-target effects are induced by seed-matched
(SM) targets of the guide strand. The completely-matched (CM) or SM
off-target effect of the passenger strand is also observed. The siRNA
satisfying four functional siRNA rules was used.

Only a limited fraction of siRNA sequences are functional
in mammalian
cells. We revealed the guidelines for functional siRNA sequences in
mammalian cells using various types of experiments.3 Functional siRNAs satisfied the following four conditions
simultaneously: (i) A/U at the 5′-terminus of the siRNA guide
strand, (ii) G/C at the 5′-terminus of the passenger strand,
(iii) AU richness at the 5′ one-third of the guide strand,
and (iv) absence of a long GC stretch (>9 nts) (Figure 1). Results from a number of
studies suggest
that asymmetry in the stability of the siRNA termini is essential
for determining the unwinding direction of the siRNA duplex into single-stranded
RNAs.3−5 An siRNA duplex is easily unwound from the more unstable
terminus, and the unwound 5′-terminal nucleotide is anchored
in the binding pocket in the mid domain of the AGO protein, in which
A or U is preferentially anchored at an affinity up to 30-fold higher
than that with either G or C.6 Thus, an
RNA strand with the unstable 5′-terminus acts as a functional
guide RNA. If the passenger strand of siRNA remains in the RISC, it
may induce unintended off-target effects. However, as the siRNA selected
according to the above criteria possesses a G or C residue at the
5′-terminus of the passenger strand, which has a lower affinity
with the AGO pocket, the passenger-strand-dependent off-target effects
are effectively eliminated even when the passenger strand remains
in the RISC. A total of 56 375 087 (100%) 23-mer (19
nt double-stranded region with 2 nt overhangs at both termini) subsequences
were obtained from human mRNAs registered in the RefSeq database (release
30). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 14.7% of the human siRNA
sequences satisfied all four criteria, (i)–(iv), for functional
siRNAs; 98% of more than 100 different siRNAs satisfying these sequence
rules were experimentally confirmed to be functional. Furthermore,
at least one unique functional siRNA was selected for 92 and 99% of
human and mouse genes, respectively.3

Partial complementarity of the siRNA guide strand with nontargeted
mRNAs induces unintended off-target effects7−10 (Figure 1). Every backbone phosphate of the seed nucleotides
at positions 2–8 from the anchored 5′-terminal nucleotide
preordered on the AGO protein to make stable base-pairing between
the siRNA seed region and target mRNA in an A-form helix.11,12 The efficiency of the off-target effect is positively correlated
with the thermodynamic stability of the base pair between the guide
strand seed region and SM transcripts.10 Thus, siRNAs with low seed–target stability may be a promising
tool for target-specific RNAi with fewer off-target effects. However,
the addition of a fifth condition of low thermodynamic stability in
the seed region to the siRNA selection criteria (i)–(iv) decreased
the percentage of selectable siRNA candidates from 14.7 to 2.1%.13 This means that at least one functional siRNA
is selected for just 77.2% of human genes. To overcome such sequence
limitations, we evaluated the impact of chemical modifications in
this study. Many chemical modifications of various sites in the siRNA
were examined for improvements in siRNA specificity, stability, and
immunogenicity. Because the off-target effects of the guide strand
are induced by seed–target complementarity,7−10 the effects of a few types of
modifications in the seed region were examined.14−16 Among them,
2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) modifications of the nucleotide
at position 2 of the guide strand reduced the SM off-target effects
without a severe reduction in RNAi activity.14 However, because systematic studies on the effects of chemical modifications
in the seed region have not been performed, the mechanism of the reduced
off-target effects is not well-elucidated. In this study, five different
modifications, shown in Figure 2a, were introduced into the seed region of authentic siRNA,
which has 19 nt double-stranded region with 2 nt overhangs in both
termini (Figure 2b).

Results and Discussion
To perform
dual-luciferase reporter assays, four types of siRNA
reporter plasmids were constructed (Figure 3a). psiCHECK-gCM with a CM sequence of the
entire siRNA guide strand in the 3′UTR region of the Renilla luciferase gene was used to investigate RNAi activity
of the guide strand. psiCHECK-gSM containing three tandem-repeated
SM sequences of the guide strand was used to examine seed-dependent
off-target effects (Figure 3a). psiCHECK-pCM with three tandem repeats of CM sequences
on the passenger strand and psiCHECK-pSM with three tandem repeats
of SM sequences were used to examine passenger-strand-dependent off-target
effects (Figure S1a). Each of these plasmids
was transfected into human HeLa cells with pGL3-Control, expressing
the control firefly luciferase gene, and siRNA with or without chemical
modifications in the seed region. The chemical modifications of deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA), PS, and DNA–PS were introduced into all of the
seven nucleotides of the seed region of the siRNA guide strand (Figure 2b). In addition,
3 (positions 4–6), 5 (positions 3–7), and 7 (seed positions
2–8) nts in the guide strand were modified with 2′-OMe
(named 2′-OMe-3, 2′-OMe-5, 2′-OMe-7); and 3 (positions
3–5) and 7 (seed positions 2–8) nts were modified with
LNA (LNA-3, LNA-7) (Figure 2b). siRNA against an enhanced green fluorescent protein (siGY441)
was used as a negative control. One day after transfection, firefly
and Renilla luciferase activities were measured and
relative luciferase activity was calculated as an indicator of the
CM RNAi activity and SM off-target effects of the guide strand and
CM and SM off-target effects of the passenger strand.

Unmodified siRNA downregulated the Renilla luciferase
activity via the guide strand CM target in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3b). siRNA
modified with DNA, PS, 2′-OMe (2′-OMe-3, -5, -7), or
LNA (LNA-3) reduced the expression of the CM target of the guide strand
at the equivalent level to that of unmodified siRNA, particularly
at high concentrations (0.5 or 5 nM). PS is a modification in which
one of the nonbridging oxygens is replaced by sulfur,17 which blocks the exonuclease action and increases its permeability
through the lipid bilayer, but PS has little effect on base pair formation.18,19 In fact, PS-modified siRNA did not inhibit RNAi activity against
the CM target. The various modifications at the 2′-position
of the pentose sugar of siRNA are not required for RNAi20,21 and target recognition.15 DNA is modified
with hydrogen at C2′, and the 5′ one-third of each RNA
strand is capable of replacement with DNA without substantial loss
of RNAi activity.15 Consistent with our
previous report,15 DNA replacement at the
seed region of the guide strand alone retained efficient RNAi activity
on the CM target. 2′-OMe is a well-known C2′-modification
that increases serum stability and specificity in base-pairing and
abrogates immunogenicity.20,22−24 2′-OMe is tolerated at multiple positions in the siRNA guide
strand because of its small size, comparable to the 2′-OH of
natural RNA.25 Our results also showed
that three 2′-OMe nucleotide modifications resulted in similar
suppression levels on the CM target compared with unmodified RNA,
although the efficiency was slightly reduced with increasing 2′-OMe
modifications in the seed region (Figure 3b). LNAs contain a bridge connecting the
2′-oxygen with the 4′-carbon of the ribose ring, resulting
in a greater stability compared to that of 2′-OMe.26,27 LNA-3 suppressed the expression of the CM target, but LNA-7 showed
little to no activity.

The off-target effects on the SM target
of the guide strand were
observed for unmodified siRNAs in a reporter assay using psiCHECK-gSM
(Figure 3c). siRNAs
with PS modifications exhibited similar, but slightly weaker inhibitory
effects compared to those from unmodified siRNAs, probably because
PS modification has little effect on base pair formation.18,19 The inhibitory effect on the SM target of DNA-modified siRNAs was
decreased, consistent with our previous results.15 DNA–PS-modified siRNA exhibited almost no effects.
This may be because the base-pair stability of the DNA–RNA
duplex is weaker than that of the RNA duplex.15 In contrast to DNA-modified siRNAs, the inhibitory effects on the
SM target of the 2′-OMe and LNA modifications were strikingly
decreased, even though both result in strong base pairs28 (Figure 3c).

Because we used siRNAs that satisfy the four functional
siRNA sequence
criteria,3 the guide strand is easily unwound
from the 5′ terminus, but the passenger strand is not. In fact,
almost no or little inhibitory effects on the CM or SM target of the
passenger strand were observed in the reporter assays using psiCHECK-pCM
or psciCHECK-pSM, respectively (Figure S1a).

Although DNA duplexes form B-form structures, structural
superposition
of the guide DNA–target RNA heteroduplex in the AGO complex
fits better with the A-form helix of RNA duplexes than with the B-form.29 This implies that the duplex formed between
a target transcript and an AGO-preloaded guide strand is modified
to an A-form structure.

Computationally, we investigated how
each chemical modification
affects the single-stranded RNA structure that is not associated with
protein. The single-stranded RNA structures of 5′-GC-3′
modified by 2′-OMe or LNA were calculated using density functional
theory at the ωB97-XD/6-31G(d) level. The results of geometry
optimization revealed that unmodified RNA can form at least three
different stable conformation types: (i) the “Watson (W)–Crick
(C) face form” in which two neighboring nucleotides are stabilized
by two stacked hydrogen bonds, primed to form W–C base pairs
when the complementary RNA strand is recognized (Figure 4a); (ii) “rigid strand
1” in which the OH residue at the C2′ position forms
bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the sugar and downstream phosphate
(Figure 4b); and (iii)
“rigid strand 2” with different hydrogen bonds compared
to those in structure 1 (Figure 4c). LNA-modified RNA had structures corresponding to
structures 1 and 3 of unmodified RNA (Figure 4d–f), but we could not detect the
corresponding structure 2. 2′-OMe-modified RNA had structures
corresponding to structures 1 and 2 of unmodified RNA (Figure 4g,h). Additionally, structure
4, containing a stretched backbone, was also observed (Figure 4i). A comparison of the relative
energies of these structures in each modification is shown in Figure 4j. In the case of
2′-OMe modifications, the W–C face form (structure 1)
was the most stable and the relative energies of the other structures
(structures 2 and 4) were rather high, which indicated that 2′-OMe
modifications destabilized largely the other structures. In the case
of unmodified RNA, even though structure 1 (W–C face form)
is the most stable, other structures can be taken rather easily because
of the hydrogen bonding ability of 2′-OH with the phosphate
region of the backbone (Figure 4j). This suggests that 2′-OMe and LNA modifications
inhibit the conformational variation of the RNA backbone and tend
to keep the RNA structure suitable for base-pairing with target RNA;
thus, the 2′-OMe modification results in the most stable W–C
base-pairing and the LNA modification results in the second-most-stable
pairing, with unmodified RNA having the lowest stability. Our previous
results demonstrated that SM off-target effects are high when the
stability of the seed–target duplex is high.10 However, both 2′-OMe and LNA modifications exhibited
strong base-pairing stability with weaker off-target effects, in contrast
to our previous results.

and 2′-OMe-modified
RNA structures. Structures of unmodified RNA (a–c) and LNA-modified

superposition patterns of O–P–O at the 5′ side
of guanine (upper panels), and O–P–O at central phosphate
(lower panels) was overlapped.

The phosphates of the siRNA guide strand interact with the
amino
acid side chains of the AGO protein.12 Therefore,
it was speculated that 2′-OMe and LNA sugar modifications did
not inhibit the association between the guide RNA and AGO. Our computational
prediction revealed that structure 1 of the 2′-OMe-modified
RNA was similar to that of the unmodified RNA (Figure 4k), consistent with a previous report.30 However, the structure of LNA-modified RNA differed
from that of 2′-OMe-modified RNA (Figure 4k), probably, because the sugar puckering
may affect the backbone conformation. Structure 2 of unmodified RNA
and 2′-OMe-modified RNA exhibited only slight differences (Figure 4l), whereas structure
3 of unmodified RNA and LNA-modified RNA strongly differed in their
overall structures, probably, because the sugar puckering is affected
by the linkage between C2′ and C4′ (Figure 4m). Thus, the LNA modification
affects the RNA structure more severely compared to the 2′-OMe
modification.

We further examined 2′-OMe- and LNA-modified
single-stranded
RNA structures on the AGO protein. The unmodified 5′-AAA-3′
RNA structure (nucleotides 2–4 (A(2), A(3), and A(4)) of the
guide RNA) on the human AGO protein reported by Schirle et al.12 (Figure 5a) was used after optimization (Figure 5b). The side chains of the Arg (R792) and
Lys (K566) residues in AGO form hydrogen bonds with the phosphates
of the guide RNA (Figure 5a). Therefore, the full geometry optimization was achieved
including R792 and K566, with capping each of the amino acid main
chains with a methyl group (Figure 5b). The RNA structure in which the sugar of A(3) was
modified with 2′-OMe (Figure 5c) or LNA (Figure 5d) was also optimized including R792 and K566. Overlapping
of unmodified RNA and 2′-OMe-modified RNA and unmodified RNA
and LNA-modified RNA on the AGO protein is shown in Figure 5e,f, respectively. As shown
in Figure 5e, the 2′-OMe
modification of A(3) led to little conformational change in A(2),
A(3), R792, and K566. However, the 2′-OMe modification of the
sugar in A(3) caused the repulsion of the methyl group with the nucleotide
(A(4)) on the 3′ side and the conformation of the third adenine
residues (A(4)) of 2′-OMe-modified RNA became different from
that of unmodified RNA (Figure 5e). On the other hand, the LNA modification induced a different
effect: the methylene group of the LNA caused steric hindrance to
Hα of R792 and pushed R792 away, which would result in a large
structural change of the AGO binding site, even though a stacked structure
of LNA-modified RNA was almost kept (Figure 5f).

2′-OMe-modified,
and LNA-modified structures loaded on the AGO protein binding pocket.

distances (in Å) between C4′ (of A(3)) and Hα (of
R792) atoms in unmodified RNA (in brown) and in LNA-modified RNA (in
blue).

Thus, although both 2′-OMe
and LNA are well-known modifications
that enhance the base-pairing stability under protein-free conditions,
our results strongly suggest that these modifications induce different
steric hindrance, which would result in different effects on RNA silencing
efficiency on CM and SM targets in terms of steric hindrance in association
with the AGO protein or base-pairing with the target RNA. The 2′-OMe
modification in the seed region of the siRNA guide strand was essentially
stable on the AGO protein, as shown in the crystal structure by Schirle
et al.,31 but it was revealed that the
2′-OMe modification may disturb base-pairing with the target
RNA because of the conformational change in the 3′-side nucleotide
(Figure 5e). Schirle
et al. also showed that 2′-OMe of a specific nucleotide in
2′-OMe-modified guide RNA leads to a major positional shift
of ∼6 Å (31). Such a positional shift of 2′-OMe-modified
nucleotides propagates further and disorders the modified siRNA structure.
Certainly, the suppression activity on the SM target was greatly reduced
by the guide strand with 2′-OMe modifications in all of the
seven nucleotides compared to that from those in three or
five nucleotides, although the effect of siRNA with three 2′-OMe
modifications was slightly weaker than that with five (Figure 3c). However, all of the 2′-OMe-modified
siRNAs showed strong gene repression effects on the CM target (Figure 3b), although the
inhibitory effects were slightly reduced according to the increase
of the 2′-OMe modifications. The 5′-half of the siRNA
guide strand is more sensitive sterically to chemical modifications
than is the 3′-half with regard to RNAi activity against the
CM target.32 Then, the nonseed region may
play important roles in RNAi against the CM target. Recent single-molecule
imaging revealed that the AGO protein reshapes the binding properties
of the microRNA (miRNA) guide strand and serves as a specificity determinant
with thermodynamic and kinetic properties typical of RNA-binding proteins.33,34 They showed that when RISC binds a target transcript through both
miRNA seed and its 3′ supplementary nonseed region it dissociates
nearly as rapidly as for seed-only binding and the rates of association
and dissociation are very similar for these two binding modes. Our
results clearly suggested that the seed–target base pair regulates
the SM target expression. However, even when the expression of the
SM target was not inhibited by siRNA with 2′-OMe or LNA modifications
in the seed region, the expression of its CM target was significantly
inhibited (Figure 3b,c). Thus, our result suggests that the nonseed region may compensate
the incomplete seed–target base pair for inducing RNAi on the
CM target.

The guide RNA structure with LNA modifications on
the AGO protein
was kinked by the sugar puckering by the linkage between C2′
and C4′ (Figure 4k–m), indicating that the base-pairing with target RNA is
disturbed to some extent. Furthermore, the LNA-modified guide strand
repulsed within the AGO binding site (Figure 5f). Thus, it was considered that siRNA modified
with LNA in 7 nts at the seed region, LNA-7, did not associate with
the AGO protein. Then, the expression of both the CM and SM targets
may not be inhibited (Figure 3b,c). However, LNA-3 can associate with the AGO protein. Then,
the SM off-target effects were reduced by the disturbance of base-pairing
with the target RNA (Figure 3c) without substantial effects on the CM target (Figure 3b).

Microarray
analysis was performed to examine the genome-wide off-target
effects of siRNAs modified with DNA, PS, 2′-OMe, and LNA (Figure 2b). Unmodified and
modified siRNAs were each transfected into HeLa cells. Total RNA was
purified from cells 1 day later and subjected to microarray analyses.
The MA plots (M = intensity ratio, A = average intensity) of the microarray data indicated
changes in the expression levels of the annotated transcripts, and
the cumulative distribution indicated the averaged fold-changes of
the SM targets and control non-SM transcripts (Figures 6a,b, S2, and S3). The expression level of a CM target of vimentin gene was unambiguously
downregulated by the unmodified siRNA to 11%, and the siRNAs modified
with DNA, PS, 2′-OMe-3, 2′-OMe-5, 2′-OMe-7, and
LNA-3 exhibited similar levels of RNAi activity as that of the unmodified
siRNA, but LNA-7 modifications showed little to no activity (Figure 6c). The difference
in the mean log 2 fold-changes of SM or non-SM transcripts
was calculated as an indicator of the degree of off-target effects
(Figure 6d,e). PS modifications
had no effect on off-target effects, similar to the reporter assay
results, compared to those of unmodified siRNA (Figure 3b), and DNA modifications reduced the off-target
effects as reported previously.15 In the
microarray experiments, off-target effects caused by the passenger
strand were also observed. Unmodified and DNA-modified siRNAs showed
similar levels of off-target effects as those of the passenger strand,
but PS-modified siRNA exhibited stronger passenger-strand-dependent
off-target effects (Figure 6e). Three 2′-OMe-modified siRNAs (2′-OMe-3,
-5, and -7) and two LNA-modified siRNAs (LNA-3 and -7) exhibited reduced
SM off-target effects in both strands compared to those of unmodified
siRNA. These results also support the importance of steric hindrance
in association with the AGO protein and base pair with target RNA.
If asymmetry in siRNA terminal stability is the exclusive determinant
of the siRNA unwinding efficiency, simultaneous reductions in the
off-target effects of both strands cannot be explained. In this study,
it was suggested that siRNAs modified by LNA in the seed region did
not successfully associate with AGO. When the number of nucleotides
with LNA modifications is small, a target gene could be successfully
repressed, but when all of the seed nucleotides were modified, a CM
target as well as SM target(s) should not be repressed. However, it
was suggested that siRNAs modified by 2′-OMe in the seed region
did not affect the association with the AGO protein but formed defective
base pairs with target transcripts. This means that the 2′-OMe
modification may exhibit the similar effect of siRNA with seed sequences
composed of nucleotides with low thermodynamic stabilities, as shown
in our previous report,15 because both
commonly disturb the stable base pair between the siRNA seed region
and its SM targets.

The off-target effects of the guide strand of 2′-OMe-modified
siRNAs were greatest for the 2′-OMe-5 modification compared
to those for the 2′-OMe-3 and 2′-OMe-7 modifications
(Figure 6d). A similar
pattern was also observed in the reporter assay (Figure 3c). These results may be explained
by the counterbalance between two opposing factors regulating the
seed-dependent off-target effects: base-pair stability in the seed–target
duplex and steric hindrance in the base pair with the SM targets on
the AGO protein. The 2′-OMe-7 modification may result in a
more stable base pair in the seed–target duplex compared to
that from the 2′-OMe-3 modification under protein-free conditions.
However, the base pair with the SM target RNAs on AGO should be more
sterically distorted with 2′-OMe-7 compared to that from 2′-OMe-3.
With regard to 2′-OMe-5, the balance between seed–target
base-pairing stability and steric hindrance may induce greatest SM
off-target effects among the three 2′-OMe-modified siRNAs.

However, unlike those of the guide strand, the off-target effects
of the passenger strand gradually increased with the number of 2′-OMe
modifications in the guide strand seed region (Figure 6e). The results suggest that only the unwinding
efficiency of each terminus may affect the off-target effect of the
passenger strand. The 5′-terminal base-pairing stability in
siRNA duplexes was highest for the 2′-OMe-7 modification and
lowest for the 2′-OMe-3 modification, indicating that unwinding
from the 5′-terminus of the guide strand is most favorable
for 2′-OMe-3 but unfavorable for 2′-OMe-7. Thus, unwinding
from the 5′-terminus of the passenger strand is easy for 2′-OMe-7
but difficult for 2′-OMe-3, leading to a stronger induction
of off-target effects by the former compared to that by the latter.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the chemical modifications of DNA, PS, DNA–PS,
2′-OMe, and LNA in the seed region of the siRNA guide strand
reduced the off-target effects of the guide strand SM targets and
may also reduce those of the passenger strand CM and SM targets. Such
off-target effects were greatly reduced without affecting the RNAi
effects on the CM target using siRNA containing 2′-OMe modifications
in the guide strand seed region. Our results suggest that appropriate
introduction of 2′-OMe into siRNA can reduce off-target effects
by inducing steric hindrance in duplex formation on the AGO protein.
Such a chemical modification may function in a similar manner to the
nucleotide sequences in the siRNA seed region with low thermodynamic
stability. Because the off-target effects are serious problems that
need to be addressed, the modifications like 2′-OMe in the
seed region may overcome the limitations of siRNA sequences by reducing
the off-target effects and may be useful as a potential therapeutic
in the future.

In this study, we used an siVIM-270,3 which
satisfies four functional sequence conditions, to examine the seed-dependent
off-target effects. The guide strand sequence of siRNA against human
vimentin (siVIM-270) is 5′-UUGAACUCGGUGUUGAUGGCG-3′
and the passenger strand sequence is 5′-CCAUCAACACCGAGUUCAAGA-3′.
RNA oligonucleotides of siRNA duplexes with and without modifications,
shown in Figure 2a,
were chemically synthesized (Genepharma).

Construction of Luciferase
Reporters with CM and SM Sequences
All of the reporter plasmids
were constructed from psiCHECK-1 (Promega).
Oligonucleotides with the target sequence that is CM to the siRNA
guide strand (5′-tcgaCGCCATCAACACCGAGTTCAAGA-3′ and
5′-aattTCTTGAACTCGGTGTTGATGGCG-3′) and three tandem
repeats of the passenger strand CM target sequences (5′- tcgaTCTTGAACTCGGTGTTGATGGCGAATCTTGAACTCGGTGTTGATGGCGAATCTTGAACTCGGTGTTGATGGCGAA-3′
and 5′-aattTTCGCCATCAACACCGAGTTCAAGATTCGCCATCAACACCGAGTTCAAGATTCGCCATCAACACCGAGTTCAAGA-3′)
were chemically synthesized with cohesive XhoI/EcoRI ends. They were annealed and inserted into psiCHECK-1
at the corresponding restriction enzyme sites and named psiCHECK-gCM
and psiCHECK-pCM, respectively. Similarly, psciCHECK with three tandem repeats of SM sequences to
the siRNA guide strand (5′-tcga AATGATGCACCAGGAGAGTTCAAAATGATGCACCAGGAGAGTTCAAAATGATGCACCAGGAGAGTTCAA-3′
and 5′-aattTTGAACTCTCCTGGTGCATCATTTTGAACTCTCCTGGTGCATCATTTTGAACTCTCCTGGTGCATCATT-3′)
and the passenger strand (5′-tcga AATGATGCACCAGGAGTTGATGGAATGATGCACCAGGAGTTGATGGAATGATGCACCAGGAGTTGATGG-3′
and 5′-aattCCATCAACTCCTGGTGCATCATTCCATCAACTCCTGGTGCATCATTCCATCAACTCCTGGTGCATCATT-3′),
each of which has complementarity with the 8 nt long seed-containing
sequence but not with the nonseed region, were also generated and
named psiCHECK-gSM and psiCHECK-pSM, respectively. Each of the inserted
targets was expressed as part of the 3′-UTR region of Renilla luciferase mRNA in the transfected cells.

Cell Culture
and the RNA Silencing Activity Assay Using the
Firefly Luciferase Reporter System
Human HeLa cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco
BRL) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Mitsubishi
Kagaku) at 37 °C. The cells inoculated in each well of 24-well
plates at 1 × 105 cells/mL were transfected simultaneously
with psiCHECK-gCM, -gSM, -pCM, and -pSM target constructs (100 ng),
pGL3-Control (100 ng; Promega), and siRNA duplex (0.0005, 0.005, 0.05,
0.5, and 5 nM) using 2 μL of lipofectamine 2000 per well (Life
Technologies). siGY441 was used as the control. The cells were harvested
24 h post-transfection, and the relative luciferase activity (Renilla luciferase activity/firefly luciferase activity)
was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
The pGL3-Control encoding firefly luciferase served as a control for
the calculation of the relative luciferase activity.

Computational
Prediction of the Structure of Modified RNA
All of the geometries
of single-stranded 5′-GC-3′
RNA structures [unmodified and modified (2′-OMe or LNA for
both G and C)] were optimized at the theoretical level of ωB97-XD/6-31G(d).
We confirmed that all of the optimized geometries are local minima
with all positive harmonic frequencies. Zero-point energy (ZPE) was
calculated using the harmonic frequencies for each of the local minima.
The optimized geometries are shown in Figure 4, and the energies are listed in Table S1, together with all of the Cartesian
coordinates.

The Cartesian coordinates of the crystal structure12 (PDB 4OLA) were used as an initial geometry for 5′-AAA-3′
RNA loaded on the AGO protein. Arg792 and Lys566 from the AGO protein
were taken into the calculations, where the main chains of these amino
acids were replaced by methyl groups (Figure S4). For 5′-AAA-3′
RNA, we used three types: unmodified and modified (2′-OMe or
LNA for the central A). The full geometry optimization was performed
for each of the models of the three types (5′-AAA-3′
RNA with Arg792 and Lys566) at the theoretical level of ωB97-XD/6-31G(d).
The optimized geometries are shown in Figure 5, and the energies are listed in Table S2, together with all of the Cartesian
coordinates. The Gaussian 0935 program
package was used for all of the calculations. The calculations were
carried out at the Center for Quantum Life Sciences (QuLiS) and at
the Research Center for Computational Science, Okazaki National Research
Institutes.

Microarray Analysis
The cells inoculated
in each of
2 wells of 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/mL were
transfected with 50 nM of siRNA duplex using 2 μL of Lipofectamine
2000. At 24 h post-transfection, total RNA was purified with an RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) and RNA quality was assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific) and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). cDNA was synthesized
from each total RNA sample using an Agilent one-color spike mix kit
(Agilent) and used for hybridization to an Agilent SurePrint G3 human
GE microarray (8 × 60 K, ver. 2.0, 3.0) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA from mock-transfected cells treated with the transfection
reagent in the absence of siRNA was used as a control, and the distributions
of the signal intensities of transcripts were normalized across all
samples by quantile normalization.36 They
were shown in MA plots and cumulative accumulations.
