Tight
sandstone reservoir has been characterized by low permeability
and porosity, developed micro-nanopore throats, strong capillary forces,
and high content of clay minerals. It is vulnerable to damage caused
by water sensitivity during the processes of reservoir development,
which significantly impedes the hydrocarbon production. Hence, it
is important to analyze the damage mechanism of water sensitivity
to avoid the production decrease. However, the conventional steady-state
method is time-consuming and inaccurate for evaluating the water-sensitivity
damage in tight low-permeability reservoirs. Aiming at this problem,
this paper introduced pressure transmission test (PTT), a time-saving
and accurate method, to quantitatively evaluate the degree of damage
by water sensitivity. Moreover, lithofacies analysis methods, consisting
of computed tomography (CT) scanning, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), are also used to evaluate the
reservoir properties, which can provide a basis for analyzing the
potential damage factors. The CT scanning results show that the developed
micropore throat in the target reservoirs has poor connectivity. The
XRD results indicate that the target reservoir mainly consists of
a mixed-layer illite/smectite and smectite, which is consistent with
the observation by SEM experiments. The results of PTT show that the
ultimate average damage rate of water sensitivity is approximately
62.94%, attributed to the medium-strong water sensitivity. Compared
with the conventional steady-state method measuring the outlet flow
of the core, this method can reduce the experimental errors merely
by recording the pressure data varying with time. Moreover, it is
also applicable for evaluating other types of formation sensitivity
damage, such as alkali and acid sensitivity damage for low-permeability
reservoirs.

1 Introduction
With the characteristics of low permeability, low porosity, and
strong capillary force, tight sandstone reservoirs are vulnerable
to water-sensitivity damage caused by the invasion of extraneous fluids
during the process of reservoir development.1−5 The contact of extraneous fluids with the formation
may cause hydration, expansion, dispersion, and migration of clay
minerals, resulting in the decrease of formation permeability. Investigation
of water-sensitivity damage can be traced back to the 1940s, when
Johnston and Beeson (1945) performed water-sensitivity damage experiments
on 1200 core samples and illustrated permeability impairment of clay-bearing
reservoirs by injecting low-salinity water.6 Since then, it has gone through three stages of defining migration
and dispersion mechanisms, theoretical analysis, and controlling technology
research. According to previous studies, water-sensitive damage can
be classified into three categories. In the first one, the phenomenon
of smectite hydration and expansion will occur when smectite contacts
with external water, leading to the decrease of pore radius and permeability.
In the second, the migration of kaolinite and hairlike illite will
induce the blockage of pores and throat. In the third, chlorite is
prone to become a colloidal precipitate after acidification.7−12

At present, the evaluation of formation-sensitivity damage
in tight
low-permeability reservoirs is mainly based on the core flow experiment.
The formation sensitivity is reflected by measuring the change of
core permeability before and after the displacement of the working
fluid, and the sensitivity index (the ratio of permeability variation
to initial value of the permeability) is used to evaluate the sensitivity.
After extensive research, a large number of scholars conducted studies
on the formation sensitivity based on conventional core flow experiments.
To study the effects of water-sensitive damage on the seepage characteristics
of microscopic water flooding, Zhu et al. used the sandstone model
made by the reservoir core to carry out three types of water flooding
experiments in single, double, and combined models.13 Liu studied the rules of water-sensitivity damage of carbonate
rocks.14 Han and Liao studied the mechanism
of water sensitivity by analyzing the reservoir rock composition,
physical properties, and pore structure.15,16 Zhu introduced nuclear magnetic resonance technology to analyze
the rate of damage of water sensitivity in sandstone reservoir.17 Leng et al. combined core flow experiments with
core computed tomography (CT) scanning techniques to carry out the
quantitative evaluation of the water-sensitivity damage.18

In summary, due to the high core permeability
of conventional oil
and gas reservoirs, it is feasible to analyze the reservoir water-sensitivity
damage through the traditional steady-state method; however, for the
tight low-permeability reservoirs (shale, tight sandstone, bedrock,
etc.), the steady-state core flow method is not applicable as it is
time-consuming and inefficient.

In response, unsteady-state
methods, including pressure attenuation
method, pressure transmission method, and periodic oscillation method,
are usually applied in measuring the core permeability of a tight
low-permeability reservoir. Pressure attenuation method proposed by
You and Kang et al. was used to evaluate the formation-sensitivity
damage of in Daniudi Gas Field.19,20 However, this method
takes a long time to complete, making it vulnerable to external environmental
impact. Periodic oscillation method was first proposed by Kranz et
al., who referred to the measurement of thermal diffusivity and measured
the permeability of low-permeability rocks.21 Fischer et al. further elaborated the theoretical background, experimental
design, and data processing of the periodic oscillation method.22 Unfortunately, this method requires a high performance
from the instrument and has a high cost. Therefore, this paper introduced
the pressure characteristics of transmission test of saving time and
cost-effectiveness to measure the core permeability. This method was
first proposed by Brace et al. in 1968 and the semianalytical solution
of the method is also given.23 But it is
assumed that the rock porosity is zero, which is quite different from
the actual core. Lin adopted a numerical method to analyze the model
proposed by Brace and proposed to replace the semianalytical solution
of Brace with the numerical solution; however, the calculation time
of the numerical solution was too long for convenience.24 Hsieh et al. gave an analytical solution to
the Brace model, which is a breakthrough in this method.25 Dicker et al. proposed a general solution to
the method based on Hsieh’s results and Brace’s model;
this method is widely applied in the petroleum industry.26

In this paper, based on the previous research
studies on pressure
transmission method, an analytical model was derived to calculate
the core permeability. Furthermore, considering the low permeability
of the target reservoir, microscopic lithofacies analysis and macroscopic
pressure transmission experiments were performed to investigate the
water-sensitivity damage.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Analysis of Potential Damage Factors
The characteristics
of the pore microstructure of the reservoir are
one of the intrinsic causes of formation-sensitivity damage. Understanding
the pore microstructure can help analyze the potential damage factors
of the reservoirs. In this study, a multislice spiral CT scanner was
applied to investigate the spatial distribution of pores in the whole
core. The CT scan date was processed by MATLAB, and the three-dimensional
visualization of the core can be obtained through the commercial software
Tecplot. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the three cores have only a few pores. Furthermore,
since the CT scan is shown as slices along the axial direction of
the core, the average porosity of each slice can be analyzed to quantitatively
describe the porosity distribution of the core. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the average porosity
along the axial direction of the core. It can be concluded that the
porosity of these three cores is approximately 5%. This result shows
that the core in the target reservoir is very tight.

(from left to right are cores of 7, 14,
and 20).

Figure 2 Distribution of average porosity along the axial
direction (from
left to right are cores of 7, 14, and 20).

Another intrinsic cause of water-sensitive damage is the
rock mineral
composition, especially the type and morphology of the clay minerals.
To make the further analysis of morphology of clay minerals and mineral
species, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) experiments were performed on the fragments of target core samples.
The SEM in Figure 3 shows that the main constituents of clay minerals in the target
reservoir are mixed-layer illite/smectite, which is mainly distributed
in or near the center of the pore throats and increases the structural
complexity of the pore throats. In addition, intergranular pores and
intragranular pores are developed in the core, and the connectivity
of the pore throat is poor.

Figure 3 Photographs of SEM.

According to the principle of Stokes settlement experiment,
the
clay minerals with particle size less than 4 μm in the core
powder were extracted by sedimentation. The total amount of clay minerals
and the relative contents of various clay minerals were obtained by
X-ray diffraction analysis. As can be seen from Table 1, the target reservoir has a high content
of clay mineral of up to 38.9%. It mainly consists of a mixed-layer
illite/smectite and smectite, which is consistent with the observation
by the SEM experiments. Therefore, when clay minerals are exposed
to extraneous fluids, on the one hand, the swelling of the clay minerals
leads to an increase of irreducible water. On the other hand, the
expanding clay minerals plug the pores and greatly decrease the radius
of the pores, causing serious damage to the reservoirs.

2.2 Analysis of Water-Sensitivity
Damage
As can be seen from Figure 4, the applied upstream pressure remains stable
and the corresponding
downstream pressure increases from the initial pressure with time
until it reaches a pick and remains steady during water-sensitivity
damage experiments. In addition, it takes very long for the pressure
downstream to reach an equilibrium when the salinity of the experimental
fluids decreases. Especially, the stable time of deionized water is
approximately twice that of the mimicked formation water. This indicates
that the core samples suffer serious water-sensitivity damage, resulting
in significant reduction of seepage capacity. There is also an obvious
phenomenon that the final stable downstream pressure is always slightly
lower than the applied upstream pressure during the damage experiments.
The internal reason is that the low-permeability rock behaves like
a semipermeable membrane, resulting in an osmotic effect.27,28

M1-1, right: M1-2). Note: ① mimicked formation brine; ②,
③, ④ mimicked formation brine diluted to 75, 50, and
25%; and ⑤ deionized water.

According to the definition of dimensionless pressure, it
can be
concluded that the dimensionless pressure will keep steady when the
downstream pressure reaches an equilibrium. Hence, this paper only
focuses on the increasing stage of the downstream pressure. Figure 5 shows the dimensionless
pressure versus time before and after every damage of two core samples.
The slope (ξ) and fitting coefficient (R2) were acquired by the linear fitting method. It can be seen
that all fitting coefficients were above 0.97, which shows an excellent
linear fitting. According to eq 15, the permeabilities of the core samples before and
after every damage can be obtained. Furthermore, the rate of water-sensitivity
damage can be calculated by eq 16).

Figure 5 Permeability calculation curve of formation cores (left: M1-1,
right: M1-2).

As can be seen from Figure 6, with the reduction
of the salinity of the working fluid,
core permeability decreases and damage rate increases. Due to the
invasion of water, the permeabilities of the core samples suffer significant
reduction. The degree of ultimate water-sensitivity damage of the
two core samples is 63.09 and 62.79%, respectively, which fall into
the category of medium-strong sensitivity. Therefore, to avoid the
reduction of permeability as a result of the decrease of production,
it is necessary to prevent the water-sensitivity damage during the
development of reservoirs. Furthermore, different kinds of surfactants,
which can alter the wettability of rock and reduce the interfacial
tension, have been widely applied in the field to mitigate the water-sensitivity
damage. Clay stabilizer, which can inhibit the expansion and migration
of clay minerals, also has been used in the field application.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, microscopic lithofacies analysis and macroscopic
pressure transmission were combined to study the water sensitivity
of the formation damage for tight low-permeability reservoir. Based
on the experimental results and theoretical analysis, the following
conclusions are obtained:(1) The formation of target reservoir
is tight, and its average permeability and porosity are 0.05 md and
5%, respectively. The clay minerals of target reservoir mainly consist
of mixed-layer illite/smectite.

(2) The results of pressure transmission
tests show that the ultimate average damage rate of water sensitivity
is approximately 60%, which falls into the category of medium-strong
sensitivity.

(3) This method
is also applicable to
evaluate other types of formation-sensitivity damage, such as alkali
and acid sensitivity damages of low-permeability reservoirs.



4 Principle of Pressure Transmission
Test
4.1 Permeability Model
Figure 7 shows the physical model of
the pressure transmission instrument. Obviously, it is a one-dimensional
saturated seepage model along the vertical direction. Therefore, a
mathematical model, which describes the permeability of tight sandstone
reservoirs, was established.27,28 In this model, the
fluids flowed across the top of the core sample at a constant upstream
pressure (Pm) while the downstream pressure
of the reservoir beneath the core sample is initially maintained at Po. In addition, assume
that the initial pressure in the downstream and the rock sample is Po.

Figure 7 Schematic diagram of pressure transmission test.

First, a mathematical model is
established for calculating the
core permeability. The one-dimensional diffusion equation is as follows 1  where 2   initial conditions:
3   boundary conditions:
4   5  This experimental
system does not need to
measure the flow rate at x = L.
Therefore, the compression coefficient was introduced to modify formula 5 6  where ∂P/∂t is the pressure change with time in the
downstream; η
is the pressure coefficient of the rock sample, cm2/s; k is the permeability of the rock sample, md; μ is
the viscosity of the working fluid, MPa·s; ϕ is the porosity
of the rock sample, dimensionless; C is the compression
coefficient of the working fluid, MPa–1; Po is the initial downstream pressure, MPa; Pm is the initial upstream pressure, MPa; A is the cross-sectional area of the rock sample, cm2; and V is the volume of the downstream container,
cm3.

4.2 Model Solving
Based on the given
boundary conditions and initial conditions, the diffusion eq 1 was solved by the method
of Laplace Transform.

First, transform the diffusion eq 1 to the Laplace space 7  It is obvious
that eq 7 is a second-order
nonhomogeneous equation,
so its general solution is 8  The coefficients C1 and C2 in eq 8 are determined from the boundary conditions.
To solve the coefficients C1 and C2, the boundary conditions must be transformed
into a Laplace form. boundary conditions:
9  Applying boundary condition 9 to eq 8 to get
a simultaneous solution, the coefficients C1 and C2 can be obtained as follows 10   11  For eq 11, refer to Carslaw et al. and Van
Oort et al. (1994).29,30 A solution to the equation that
satisfies the boundary and initial
conditions was found and can be expressed as follows 12  where the parameter ϕn are the
roots of the following equation 13  The parameter ϕn is greatly dependent on the ratio of the
pore volume of the
rock sample and the volume of the downstream reservoir; when the above
ratio is small, the equation can be simplified as follows 14  where P(L,t) is the
downstream pressure as a function of time, and its
value is equal to the pressure of the rock sample at x = L, MPa; L is the height of the
rock sample, cm. (P(L, t) – Po)/(Pm – Po) is defined as dimensionless
pressure.

Taking the natural logarithm of eq 14, and the expression of permeability can
be obtained 15  where ξ
is the slope of the curve of
dimensionless pressure with time.
