The
molecular and electronic structures of the orthometalated ruthenium(III)
and osmium(III) complexes of N-(benzophenoxazine)-o-aminophenol (OXLH2) that exhibits
versatile redox activities are reported. The redox chemistry of OXLH2 is remarkably different from that of N-(aryl)-o-aminophenol (APLH2). The study established that OXLH2 is
redox noninnocent and is a precursor of a phenoxyl radical. One of
the C–H bonds of OXLH2 is activated by
ions, and OXLH2 reveals three different redox
states as dianionic phenolato (OXL2–),
monoanionic phenoxyl radical (OXL•–), and zwitterionic phenoxium cation (OXL±) states. The
reaction of OXLH2 with [RuII(PPh3)3Cl2] in boiling toluene in air affords
an orthometalated OXL2– complex of ruthenium(III), trans-[(OXL2–)RuIII(PPh3)2(Cl)] (1), whereas the
similar reaction with [OsII(PPh3)3Br2] yields an orthometalated OXL•– complex, cis-[(OXL•–)OsIII(PPh3)Br2] (2). 1 and 2 exhibit ligand-based reversible
redox waves due to OXL•–/OXL2–, OXL±/OXL•–, and MIII/MII couples. The 1+ ion is a OXL•– complex of ruthenium(III). 2– exhibits temperature-dependent valence tautomerism
due to [OsII(OXL•–)
↔ OsIII(OXL2–)] equilibrium. 22– is a OXL2– complex of osmium(II), while 12+ and 2+ are OXL± complexes
of metal(III). 2 is an oxidant and effective catalyst
for oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to the
corresponding quinone, and the turnover number is 119.7 h–1. The UV–vis–NIR absorption spectrum of 1 displays an NIR band at 800 nm due to an intra-ligand-charge-transfer
transition, which is absent in 2 incorporating a OXL•– radical. The molecular and electronic
structures of 1 and 2 and their oxidized
and reduced analogues were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography,
variable-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,
spectroelectrochemical measurements, and density functional theory
calculations.

Introduction
Phenoxyl
radical is a reactive chemical entity, and its stabilization
is an indispensable task in chemical science.1 The existence of phenoxyl radical in the active sites is essential
for many enzymes to perform.2 Galactose
oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase class-I, and PS II depend on tyrosyl
radicals for their redox activities.3 Phenoxyl
radical is an oxidant, and the catalytic oxidation of organic molecules
by phenoxyl radical in vitro in many cases was established.4 Thus, the chemistry of such a radical is a subject
of wide investigation. In this context, design of a chemical moiety
that stabilizes phenoxyl radical is worthy. The search reveals that
in the vast coordination chemistry of transition metal ions the chemical
moiety that furnishes phenoxyl radicals is limited in scope.

In this search, a phenoxazine derivative has been considered as
a precursor of a phenoxyl radical. Phenoxazine derivatives are bioactive
and are considered as drugs for numerous diseases.5 Various types of phenoxazine derivatives isolated from
different routes are reported.6 Benzo[a]phenoxazines based on Nile blue and Darrow red derivatives
were reported as potential fluorescent biomarkers of cancer cells
in in vitro assays.7 However, the redox
activity of N-(benzophenoxazine)-o-aminophenol (OXLH2) was not investigated in
any context. In this article, OXLH2 was successfully
isolated and its redox activity was disclosed. In this particular
study, the coordination and redox chemistry of OXLH2 with ruthenium and osmium ions was explored. The important
observation is the activation of an aromatic C–H bond of OXLH2 by these metal ions, yielding orthometalated
derivatives. This reveals that OXLH2 is a tridented
dianionic CNO-donor ligand. Notably, the orthometalated [M(OXL2–)] fragment is redox-active and can undergo
successive oxidation reversibly to a monoanionic phenoxyl radical
(OXL•–), zwitterionic phenoxium
cation (OXL±), and one-electron reduction
to trianionic p-diiminobenzosemiqunionate anion radical
(OXL•3–) states, as depicted in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Redox Intermediates
of APLH2 and OXLH2
In this project, the same theme was established by isolating a new family of transition metal
complexes of OXLH2. The redox activity of OXLH2 is different from that of N-(aryl)-o-aminophenol (APLH2), which gives an access to o-iminobenzosemiquinonate
anion radical complexes of transition metal ions.8 The redox intermediates of OXLH2 are
reactive and notably different from the iminobenzosemiquinonate anion
radical (ISL•–) and iminobenzoquinone
(IQL0) obtained from APLH2, as illustrated in Scheme 1.

The types of ruthenium and osmium complexes of OXLH2 isolated in this study are shown in Chart 1. 1 is
a OXL2– complex of ruthenium(III), whereas 2 is a OXL•– complex of
osmium(III). 1 and 2 exhibit reversible
redox waves due to OXL±/OXL•–, OXL•–/OXL2–, and MIII/MII redox couples. 2– exhibits temperature-dependent
valence tautomerism
due to [OsII(OXL•–)
↔ OsIII(OXL2–)] equilibrium.
The molecular and electronic structures of 1 and 2 and their oxidized and reduced analogues were established
by X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy,
spectroelectrochemical measurements, density functional theory (DFT),
and time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations. It is noteworthy that the
reactivities of 1 and 2 are different. 2 is an oxidant and reveals catecholase activity (CA),9 whereas no such activity was established with 1.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses
OXLH2 was isolated
from a substitution reaction of 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid
with 2-aminophenol in boiling methanol in air. Substitution of the
−SO3H group by the amine followed by condensation
and facile cyclization6a with another molecule
of aminophenol affords OXLH2, as given in Scheme 2. The reaction progresses
with a 1,4 addition reaction of the amine with the quinone substrate
followed by elimination of one molecule of H2SO3.10 The 4-amino-1,2-naphthoquinone intermediate
undergoes tautomerization and condensation reactions with another
2-aminophenol molecule, producing diamagnetic OXLH2 in high yields. No other paramagnetic or diamagnetic derivative
as a product from this synthetic reaction was detected, and the OXLH2 form containing a p-diiminoquinone
function has been considered as the most stable state.

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of OXLH2
One of the significant observations is that one of the
C–H
bonds of OXLH2 is activated by ruthenium and
osmium ions, affording orthometalated derivatives. Orthometalated OXL2– and OXL•– complexes isolated in this investigation and their total spin (St) are summarized in Chart 1. The reaction of OXLH2 with [RuII(PPh3)3Cl2]11 in boiling toluene is a redox reaction
converting ruthenium(II) to ruthenium(III) and affords 1, where O2 is an oxidant (eq 1). 1   2  Notably, the
reaction of [OsII(PPh3)3Br2]11 with OXLH2 in
boiling toluene is a 2e oxidation reaction,
producing 2 (eq 2). In this reaction, osmium(II) is oxidized to osmium(III)
and OXLH2 is oxidized to OXL•–. Details of the syntheses are outlined in
the Experimental Section, and the analytical,
IR, 1H NMR, and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectral
data are listed under corresponding complexes. The 1H NMR
spectra of OXLH2 and 2 are shown
in Figures S1 and S2. The oxidized and
reduced analogues of 1 and 2 were not isolated.
They were generated by constant-potential bulk electrolysis experiments
for UV–vis and EPR spectral measurements.

The IR spectra
of 1 and 2 are shown in Figure S3. An unambiguous assignment of the band
for the stretching vibration of the conjugated C–O (coordinated)
bond was not successful. The νC–O(coordinated) for zinc(II) phenolato complexes reported by Wieghardt is 1287 cm–1.12 In the case of 1, a broader band at 1410 cm–1 was detected,
which may be due to the coordinated C–O bond that was absent
in 2 containing a phenoxyl radical. The relatively stronger
bands at 1585 and 1570 cm–1 are respectively assigned
to noncoordinated and coordinated −C=N functions. The
last band is absent in the spectrum of the free ligand. The molecular
and electronic structures of the complexes were elucidated by single-crystal
X-ray bond parameters, fluid and frozen-glass EPR spectra, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations.

X-ray Crystallography
The molecular geometries of the
complexes were established by single-crystal X-ray structure determinations
of 1·CH2Cl2 and 2·CH2Cl2 (295 and 141 K) (CCDC 1575845,
1575847, and 1575848, respectively). The crystallographic
data are summarized in Table S1. 1·CH2Cl2 crystallizes in the C2/c space group. The molecular geometry
in crystals and the atom labeling scheme are shown in Figure 1a. The average Ru–PPh3 lengths are 2.409(2) Å (Table 1). The Ru–Cl length is 2.333(2) Å,
which is relatively shorter than RuII–Cl lengths.13 Similarly, the Ru–O length, 2.104(4)
Å, is relatively shorter.14 The Ru–NIQ length is 2.072(4) Å. The C(7)–N(1), C(10)–N(2),
and C(8)–C(9) lengths are also shorter and consistent with
the IQ state of the phenoxazine ligand. Thus, 1 is defined
as a ruthenium(III) complex of OXL2–.
The C–O lengths are significantly different in Ar–OH
(phenolic), Ar–O– (phenolato), and Ar–O• (phenoxyl) forms15 and
gradually decrease from Ar–OH to Ar–O• states. However, in the case of OXLH2, the
phenolato ion is conjugated with the p-diiminoquinone
fragment and the C(1)–O(1) length in 1·CH2Cl2, 1.278(6) Å, is relatively shorter.

2·CH2Cl2 crystallizes in
the P1̅ space group. Its diffraction study
was performed at 295 and 141 K. The molecular structure in crystals
and the atom labeling scheme of 2·CH2Cl2 are illustrated in Figure 1b. The average Os–Br, Os–C,
and Os–PPh3 lengths at 295 K are 2.490(1), 2.018(5),
and 2.383(2) Å, respectively (Table 2), which are similar to those reported in
cases of osmium(III) complexes containing CO and PPh3 as
coligands.16 The Os–O length is
1.996(4) Å, which is relatively shorter than that observed in
osmium(II)–phenolato complexes.16d The bond parameters contend that 2·CH2Cl2 contains an osmium(III) ion. The average C–N
length of the IQ fragment is 1.316(6) Å. Notably, the C(1)–O(1)
length, 1.324(6) Å, is relatively longer than that recorded in 1, 1.278(6) Å. This is due to the contribution of the
phenoxyl state that reduces the extent of delocalization of the negative
charge over the IQ fragment in 2. The trend of Ar–O
length is opposite to
that observed in a phenolato to phenoxyl conversion.15 The same trend was established by DFT calculations (vide
infra). The aromatic ring exhibits a quinoidal distortion with relatively
shorter C(2)–C(3), 1.350(9), and C(4)–C(5), 1.350(8)
Å, lengths that correlate well with the oxidation of the phenolato
ring. Thus, 2·CH2Cl2 is defined
as a OXL•– complex of osmium(III).
The X-ray bond parameters at 141 K are comparable to those found at
295 K, as listed in Table 2, and no shift of charge between the ligand and metal was
predicted from these data.

Notably, the three phenyl rings of
the PPh3 ligand of 2 are not equivalent. One
of the phenyl rings (C29–C34)
exhibits a π–π stacking interaction with the aminophenol
phenyl ring (C1–C6). The distance between the centroids of
these two phenyl rings is 3.75 Å, whereas the same for 1 is 4.07 Å. The notion was further proved by 1H NMR spectrum of 2 in CDCl3 where the protons
of these phenyl rings were deshielded unequally (Figure S3).

Redox Activity
The redox activities
of 1 and 2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry
in CH2Cl2 at 295 K using tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorophosphate
as a supporting electrolyte, and the redox potential data referenced
to the ferrocenium/ferrocene, Fc+/Fc, couple are summarized
in Table 3, where E1/21 and E1/22 are the anodic while E1/23 and E1/24 are
the cathodic potentials. The cyclic voltammogram of 1 displays two reversible anodic waves (Figure 2a) at 0.14 and 0.78 V because of OXL•–/OXL2– and OXL±/OXL•– redox couples. The reversible cathodic wave of 1 at
−1.02 V is assigned to a RuIII/RuII redox
couple. The RuIII/RuII redox couple of 1 at ≈ −1.0 V proclaims that the ruthenium(II)
state is not stable in 1 supporting the reaction proposal
in Scheme 1. The redox
activity of 2 is notably different from that of 1. 2 exhibits two reversible cathodic waves (Figure 2b) due to OXL•–/OXL2– and
OsIII/OsII redox couples at −0.35 and
−1.06 V, respectively. The OXL±/OXL•– redox couple of 2 at 0.72 V is also reversible.

EPR Spectroscopy
The CH2Cl2 fluid
solution EPR spectrum of 1 (Figure 3a) displays a strong signal at g = 2.102 that is deviated from the isotropic signals of organic radicals.
The anisotropic frozen-glass spectrum is rhombic in nature (Figure 3b), and the simulated g values are g1 = 2.301, g2 = 2.111, g3 =
1.920, and Δg = 0.38 (Table 4), which corroborate well with a ruthenium(III)
state. This reveals that 1 is a ruthenium(III) complex
of OXL2–. The frozen-glass EPR spectrum
of 12+ obtained from a constant-potential
coulometric experiment of 1 at 1.2 V vs Fc+/Fc couple, as depicted in Figure 3c, is anisotropic, and the simulated g values are g1 = 2.340, g2 = 2.128, g3 = 1.929, and
Δg = 0.41. The parameters are similar to those
of 1, suggesting that the 12+ ion is a ruthenium(III) complex of OXL±.

The EPR spectra
of the 2– ion obtained
from constant-potential bulk electrolysis of 2 at 0.95
V vs Fc+/Fc couple were recorded at different temperatures
and are shown in Figure 4a. The isotropic spectrum of the sample in CH2Cl2 at 295 K exhibits hyperfine
splitting due to two cis 79Br (I = 3/2)
nuclei, and the simulated g value is 2.008. This
is consistent with a [OsII(OXL•–)] state. However, the frozen-glass spectrum was simulated considering
[OsII(OXL•–)], g = 2.008, and [OsIII(OXL2–)], g1 = 2.538, g2 = 2.220, g3 = 1.910, and Δg = 0.63, components. The spectral feature suggests the
existence of a temperature-dependent tautomeric equilibrium of type
[OsII(OXL•–) ↔
OsIII(OXL2–)] in the 2– ion. The frozen-glass EPR spectrum of
the 2+ ion is rhombic in nature (Figure 4b). The simulated g values are g1 = 2.600, g2 = 2.060, g3 =
2.000, and Δg = 0.60 that correspond to a [OsIII(OXL±)] state of the 2+ ion.

Density Functional Theory
(DFT) Calculations
The gas-phase
geometry of trans-[(OXL2–)RuIII(PMe3)2(Cl)] (1′) was optimized with the doublet spin state, whereas 1′+ and 1′– were optimized with singlet spin states, and the calculated bond
parameters are listed in Table 1. The α spin of 1′ scatters dominantly
on ruthenium, as depicted in Figure 5a, corresponding to a OXL2– complex of ruthenium(III). The electronic state of 1+ can be presented by two electronic states (A and B) as shown in Chart 2. The closed shell singlet (CSS) solution
of 1′+ is unstable due to an open shell
singlet (OSS) perturbation. The OSS solution is 6.5 kJ mol–1 lower in energy than the CSS solution. The gas-phase geometry of 1′+ was also optimized with the triplet
spin state, and the calculated bond parameters are listed in Table 1. Notably, the triplet
solution is 28.7 kJ mol–1 lower in energy than the
corresponding CSS solution. The spin density of the triplet state
disperses on both the ruthenium ion and the phenol moiety, as depicted
in Figure 5b. In the
OSS state, the α spin is localized on the ruthenium ion and
the β spin scatters on the phenol ring (Figure 5c). This infers that the 1 → 1+ conversion is due to oxidation of phenolato
to phenoxyl states, and 1+ is defined as a OXL•– complex of ruthenium(III) corresponding
to B. On the contrary, the CSS solution of 1′– ion is stable and 1– is a ruthenium(II) complex of OXL2–. The calculated Ru–O(1), Ru–NIQ, Ru–Ar,
and Ru–PPh3 lengths of 1′– differ significantly from those of 1′.
The calculated Ru–Cl length, 2.560 Å, is relatively longer
and is consistent with a ruthenium(II) state present in 1′–. The calculated bond parameters of the 1′2+ ion using the doublet spin state estimate
the oxidation of OXL•– to OXL±. The spin is solely localized on the ruthenium
ion (Figure 5d) inferring
that the 12+ ion is a OXL± complex of ruthenium(III).

Chart 2 Possible Electronic Structures of 1+ Ion
The CSS solution of cis-[(OXL)Os(PMe3)Br2]
(2′) is stable, and the
lowest Hessian eigenvalue is only 0.005, dominantly due to highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) → lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) and HOMO – 1 → LUMO transitions. The
triplet state (S = 1) of 2′ is
7.8 kJ mol–1 higher in energy than the CSS state.
The calculated bond parameters of the triplet state are comparable
to those obtained from the singlet solution (Table 2). Analyses of the molecular orbitals of
the singlet state infer that both HOMO and LUMO are composed of dOs and π orbitals of the ligand (Figure 6a). The contribution
of the dxz/dyz/dxy orbitals to the LUMO is a measure
of the contribution of the osmium(IV) state to the electronic state
of 2. Thus, the ground electronic state of 2 is defined as a delocalized state of [OsIII(OXL•–) ↔ OsIV(OXL2–)] forms. The calculated bond parameters of 2′– (Table 2) reflect the partial reduction of both phenoxyl
and metal ion. The C(1)–O(1) length decreases due to the phenolato
state, whereas Os–O and Os–Br lengths increase due to
the osmium(II) state in the 2′– ion. It is noteworthy that the calculated C–O length is 1.307
Å for 1′ and 1.317 for the phenoxyl 1′+ state. Similarly, the C–O length
in 2′ is 1.338 Å, whereas it is 1.307 for
the phenolato 2′– state. The
study infers that the C–O length of the phenoxyl state of OXLH2 is relatively longer than that of the phenolato
state, which exhibits stronger conjugation with the diimine function.
The average C–NIQ lengths of 2′– are similar to those found in the case of 2′. The Mulliken spin density disperses dominantly over the
osmium ion, as depicted in Figure 6b, predicting [OsIII(OXL2–)] as a ground electronic state of the 2– ion. Notably, the average calculated C–NIQ lengths are 1.363 Å for the 2′2– ion and 1.320 and 1.331 Å in cases of 2′ and 2′– ions.
The average Os–Br lengths are 2.663 Å for 2′2– while 2.541 and 2.603 Å for 2′ and 2′– ions. 2′2– is defined as a resonance hybrid
of [OsIII(OXL•3–)]
↔ [OsII(OXL2–)] states.
The O(2)–C(17), O(2)–C(9), and N(2)–C(22) lengths
of 2′+ are relatively shorter and are
consistent with the OXL± state. The Mulliken
spin is delocalized on the osmium ion, as shown in Figure 6c. The 2′+ ion is a OXL± complex of osmium(III).
Considering the EPR spectral parameters and the results obtained from
DFT calculations, the electronic states of the members of the redox
series of 1 and 2 are assigned as given
in Scheme 3.

spin population analyses.

Electronic Spectra
UV–vis–near-infrared
(NIR) absorption spectra of 1 and 2 were
recorded in CH2Cl2 and are shown in Figure 7a. 1 exhibits an NIR band at 800 nm (Table 5) and a relatively stronger band at 500–650
nm. The TD DFT calculation was performed on a diamagnetic analogue, trans-[(OXL2–)RuII(PMe3)2(CO)], containing the OXL2– ligand to elucidate the origin of the lower-energy
transitions of trans-[(OXL2–)RuII(PPh3)2(CO)] and 1 that exhibit similar absorption bands at 810–815 and 555
nm. The calculation was performed in CH2Cl2 using
the CPCM model. The calculated wave length (λcal)
of trans-[(OXL2–)RuII(PMe3)2(CO)] at 810.6 is due to πphenolato → πdiimine* (89%), i.e.,
the intra-ligand-charge-transfer (ILCT) transition, whereas λcal at 575.2 nm is because of a dRu → πdiimine* (87%) transition defined as
a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition.17 The NIR absorption band of 1 at 800 nm thus
is assigned to an ILCT transition. The electronic spectrum of 2 that contains a phenoxyl radical is different from that
of 1. The characteristic absorption band of a phenoxyl
state at 410 nm is not detectable from the spectrum as 2 exhibits a broader CT band at 300–800 nm (Figure 7a). The ILCT band observed
for 1 is absent in 2. It is due to the OXL•– state that is charge-deficient.
The calculated transitions on 2′ in CH2Cl2 are summarized in Table S12. The significant calculated wave lengths (λcal)
are 671.2, 624.6, and 577.2 nm, which are, respectively, due to d → d (82%), dOs + πaromatic → πdiimine* (72%), and dOs → πdiimine* (72%) transitions. Thus, the relatively stronger absorption
band of 2 at 555 nm is due to an MLCT transition. The
UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra of oxidized and reduced
analogues were recorded by spectroelectrochemical measurements in
CH2Cl2. The changes of absorption spectra during 1 → 1+, 1 → 12+, 1 → 1–, 2 → 2+, and 2 → 2– conversions
are illustrated in Figure 7b–f. The conversion of OXL2– → OXL•– in 1 occurs with several isosbestic points diminishing the ILCT band
at 800 nm and raising a broader band at 400–430 nm (Figure 7b). The absorption
band at 410 nm is a marker of the phenoxyl state. 1+ is isoelectronic to 2; both 1+ and 2 do not exhibit the ILCT band at 800 nm.
The NIR band of 1– at 1200 nm (Figure 7d) is assigned to
the MLCT transition, supporting the reduction of ruthenium(III) to
ruthenium(II) during the 1 → 1– conversion. The absorption spectra of 2+ and 2– are similar, except
that the broader NIR absorption band of 2– at 800 nm is absent in 2+. 2– is isoelectronic to 1 and both exhibit
an absorption band near 800 nm. The oxidation of OXL2– to OXL± during 1 → 1+ and 2 → 2+ conversions gives a similar spectral pattern.
The sharper MLCT bands of 1 and 2 at 520
and 555 nm shift to a broader band at 580 nm during these conversions.

Catecholase Activity
2 is an oxidant and
exhibits catecholase activity (CA), whereas 1 does not
show such activity. CA of transition metal complexes containing higher-valent
3d metal ions was reported in numerous cases.9 However, no CA of a complex that contains a heavier transition metal
ion has been reported so far. In this study, the CA of 2 was authenticated. The phenoxyl radical present in 2 is
responsible for its CA (Figure 8a). The oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol
(3,5-DTBC) to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone, with λmax = 403 nm and ε =
1800 M–1 cm–1, was carried out
in the presence of 2 in a 1:1 MeOH and CH2Cl2. It appears that 2 is an efficient catalyst
for a catechol oxidation reaction. The reaction mixture gives a strong
EPR signal (Figure 8b) at g = 2.002, inferring that the reaction undergoes
via a semiquinonate anion radical intermediate. The rate of reaction
that depends on the concentration of 3,5-DTBC was investigated using
time drive UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 9a). Five separate reaction mixtures containing
50-, 100-, 150-, 200-, and 250-fold substrate–catalyst molar
ratios were monitored, and considering the absorption at 403 nm, the
rates of the reactions were elucidated. It was established that the
rate of the reaction depends on the substrate–catalyst ratio
as depicted in Figure 9b, predicting that the assembling of the substrate with the catalyst
during oxidation is a significant step for this redox reaction. The
maximum initial rate (Vmax) and turnover
number were calculated by the Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk
plot approaches (Table S2).18 The turnover number of the catalysis calculated
is 119.7 h–1.

Conclusions
The
article reports that the redox activities of N-(benzophenoxazine)-o-aminophenol (OXLH2) and N-(aryl)-o-aminophenol
(APLH2) are different. The redox chemistry of
the latter that is a precursor of the o-iminobenzosemiquinonate
anion radical was extensively investigated recently.8 The present study infers that OXLH2 is a precursor of a phenoxyl radical. The notion was established
by isolating/generating various types of phenolato and phenoxyl complexes
of ruthenium and osmium. OXLH2 is redox noninnocent, and one
of the C–H bonds of OXLH2 is activated
by metal ions, generating orthometalated derivatives. In these complexes,
it exists as dianionic phenolato (OXL2–), monoanionic phenoxyl radical (OXL•–), and zwitterionic phenoxium cation (OXL±) states. OXL2– and OXL•– complexes of ruthenium(III) and osmium(III) were successfully isolated.
Notably, the [OsIII(OXL2–)]
state exhibits temperature-dependent valance tautomerism due to [OsIII(OXL2–) ↔ OsII(OXL•–)] equilibrium. The OXL2– form in complexes is characterized
by an NIR absorption band near 800 nm due to an ILCT transition, whereas
it is absent in OXL•– complexes.
The isolated OXL•– complex of
osmium(III) appears to be an active catalyst for catechol oxidation.
Versatile redox activities of OXLH2 make its
complexes functional and different from APLH2 analogues. The chemistry of OXLH2 is promising
to expand the chemistry of phenoxyl radicals that are important oxidants
in biology.

Experimental Section
Materials and Physical Measurements
Reagents or analytical-grade
materials obtained from commercial suppliers were used without further
purification. The precursor 3,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydronaphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and [RuII(PPh3)3Cl2] and [OsII(PPh3)3Br2] were prepared by the reported
procedures.11 Spectroscopy-grade solvents
were used for spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements. The
C, H, and N contents of the compounds were obtained from a PerkinElmer
2400 Series II elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra of the samples
were measured from 4000 to 400 cm–1 with KBr pellets
at room temperature (RT) on a PerkinElmer spectrum RX 1 FT-IR spectrophotometer. 1H and spectra in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 and CDCl3 solvents were recorded at 296 K
on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer. ESI mass spectra were recorded
on Shimadzu LCMS 2020 mass spectrometers equipped with an electrospray
ionization (ESI) ion source. Electronic absorption spectra in solution
were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer in the
range of 3300–175 nm. The X-band EPR spectra were measured
on a Magnettech GmbH MiniScope MS400 spectrometer (equipped with temperature
controller TC H03), where the microwave frequency was measured with
an FC400 frequency counter. The EPR spectra were simulated using EasySpin
software. The electroanalytical instrument, BASi Epsilon-EC, for cyclic
voltammetric experiments in CH2Cl2 solutions
containing 0.2 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as a supporting
electrolyte was used. The BASi platinum working electrode, platinum
auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used for
the measurements. The redox potential data are referenced vs ferrocenium/ferrocene,
Fc+/Fc, couple. A BASi SEC-C thin-layer quartz glass spectroelectrochemical
cell kit (light path length of 1 mm) with platinum gauze working electrode
and SEC-C platinum counter electrode was used for spectro-electrochemistry
measurements.

(238 mg, 1.0 mmol) in methanol, 2-aminophenol (109 mg, 1.0 mmol) was
added, and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 h in air. The solution

filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and the crude mass was purified
by column chromatography. A solution of the dry mass in CH2Cl2 (15 mL) was transferred on a basic Al2O3 column, which was washed with diethyl ether to remove the
un-reacted ligand, and finally a violet solution of 1 was collected eluting with pure CH2Cl2. The
solution was evaporated to dryness. The combined residue of the reaction
and the product obtained from chromatography were collected. The product
was further purified by generating single crystals of 1·CH2Cl2. Single crystals of 1·CH2Cl2 were prepared by slow diffusion

Single-Crystal
X-ray Crystallography
Single crystals
of 1·CH2Cl2 and 2·CH2Cl2 were picked up with nylon loops
and were mounted on a Bruker AXS D8 QUEST ECO diffractometer equipped
with a Mo-target rotating-anode X-ray source and a graphite monochromator
(Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å). Final cell constants were
obtained from least-squares fits of all measured reflections. Intensity
data were corrected for absorption using intensities of redundant
reflections. The structures were readily solved by direct methods
and subsequent difference Fourier techniques. The crystallographic
data are listed in Table S1. The SHELXS-97
(Sheldrick 2008)’ software package was used for solution, and
SHELXL-2014/6 (Sheldrick, 2014) was used for the refinement.19 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
Hydrogen atoms were placed at the calculated positions and refined
as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters. The crystal
structure of 1 exhibits a “B”-level alert
due to the interaction of two aromatic ring hydrogen atoms. H(5) and
H(8) atoms appear to be closer because of the planarity of the two
aromatic rings due to chelation. The crystal structure of 2 at 141 K shows a B-level alert, whereas at 295 K, it exhibits an
“A”-level alert because of H(5) and H(8) interactions.
Both H(5) and H(8) atoms are placed at the calculated positions; thus,
the alerts are minor. In addition, the B- level alert of 1 is due to solvent voids and a disordered pendent phenyl ring of
a PPh3 ligand.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
All calculations
reported in this article were done with the Gaussian 09W20 program package supported by Gauss View 5.0.
The DFT21 and time-dependent (TD) DFT22 calculations were performed at the level of
Becke three-parameter hybrid functional with the nonlocal correlation
functional of Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP).23 Gas-phase geometries of 1′ (S = 1/2), 1′+ (OSS), 1′+ (S = 1), 1′– (S = 0), 12+ (S = 1/2), 2′
(S = 0), 2′– (S = 1/2), 2′2– (S = 0), and 2′+ (S = 1/2) as listed below were optimized using
Pulay’s direct inversion24 in the
iterative subspace (DIIS), “tight” convergent SCF procedure25 ignoring symmetry.trans-[(OXL2–)RuIII(PMe3)2(Cl)]	St = 1/2	1′

Their
optimized coordinates are summarized in Tables S3–S12. In all calculations, a
LANL2DZ basis set along with the corresponding effective core potential
was used for ruthenium and osmium.26 A
valence double-ζ basis set, 6-31G, was used for H.27 For nonhydrogen atoms C, N, P, and Br, a valence
double-ζ basis set with diffuse and polarization functions,
6-31+G*,28 was employed for all calculations.
The 60 lowest singlet excitation energies on the optimized geometries
of trans-[(OXL2–)RuII(PMe3)2(CO)] and 2′
were elucidated by TD DFT calculations in CH2Cl2 using the CPCM model.
