An improved procedure
is described for the preparation of pyranoflavylium
cations from the reaction of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylflavylium cation
with aromatic aldehydes. Modifications of the procedure of Chassaing
et al. (Tetrahedron Lett. 2008, 49, 6999–7004; Tetrahedron2015, 71, 3066–3078) circumvent the
reported restriction to electron-rich benzaldehydes and provide access
to a wide variety of substituted pyranoflavylium cations, including
those with electron-withdrawing substituents or an attached heterocyclic
or polycyclic aromatic ring. This opens the way for studies of substituent
and structural effects on the ground and excited states of these pyranoanthocyanin
analogues, the behavior of which should mirror fundamental aspects
of the chemistry and photophysics of the pyranoanthocyanin chromophores
present in mature red wines.

1 Introduction
Anthocyanin
malvidin-3-O-glucoside (oenin), the
principal red-purple pigment of Vitis vinifera grapes, is primarily responsible for the initial color of red wines
produced from them.1−3 Although large quantities of grape-derived anthocyanin
pigments are available as a byproduct of wine making, the range of
potential applications of these pigments as safe coloring agents in
foods or consumer products4−6 is limited by the relatively facile
hydration reaction.4−9 Thus, attack of water at the 2-position of the flavylium cation
chromophore group of anthocyanins to form the corresponding hemiketal,
followed by ring-opening tautomerism to the Z-chalcone
and subsequent isomerization and equilibration with the E-chalcone, results in loss of the color of these pigments above about
pH 3.6−10 In nature, this pH-dependent loss of color can be shifted to a slightly
higher pH by copigmentation,11 that is,
charge-transfer-mediated complexation of anthocyanins with colorless
electron-rich molecules11,12 such as hydroxybenzoic
or hydroxycinnamic acids or, somewhat more efficiently, by complexation
with metal cations such as Al3+ or formation of stoichiometric
supramolecular metal–organic complexes.13−16 Several studies have also shown
that the hydration reaction can be inhibited by avoiding contact of
the pigment with water,6 as in inclusion
complexes,17 by selectively stabilizing
the cationic flavylium cation form at negatively charged interfaces
such as in anionic micelles,18 or by introducing
a methyl or other substituent group at the 4-position of the flavylium
chromophore to block ring-opening tautomerization.8−10

During
the maturation of red wine, the content of free anthocyanins
decreases because of chemical reactions with yeast metabolic products,
with colorless copigment molecules derived from grapes or with the
intervention of other additives present in the wine.19−26 These reactions slowly transform the anthocyanins into complex molecules
that impart a more burgundy coloration to the wine. Among the products
that are formed, pyranoanthocyanins (Scheme 1) are particularly interesting because of
their overall contribution to the color of aged red wines,19,24 the much greater stability of their color,19,27,28 their potential contributions to the taste
(e.g., astringency),29,30 their antioxidant capacity,31,32 and the health benefits33 of moderate
consumption of red wines.

Scheme 1 Formation of Pyranoanthocyanins during the
Maturation of Red Wine
Over the last several years, various synthetic approaches
have
been developed to prepare pyranoflavylium cation analogues of the
naturally occurring pyranoanthocyanin pigments of wine.19,33−40 As in the case of anthocyanins, for which the synthetic analogues
containing the 7-hydroxyflavylium cation chromophore successfully
mimic the ground- and excited-state chemistry of naturally occurring
anthocyanin pigments,7−9,41 synthetic analogues
with the pyranoflavylium cation chromophore can also be expected to
reproduce the reactivity patterns of their natural counterparts.42 Moreover, they could eventually serve as a novel
source of synthetic cationic dyes with tunable colors43 or as chromophores in dye-sensitized solar cells.44 The principal synthetic routes reported to date
in the literature include43 (a) the reaction
of a 5,7-dihydroxyflavylium cation or, as presumably occurs in red
wine, of a natural anthocyanin with a substrate containing an enolizable
keto group (Scheme 1) or a vinylbenzene derivative;20,28,35,37 (b) reaction of either
of these with hydroxy- or dimethylamino-substituted cinnamic acids;35,36,43 (c) reaction of methyl or carboxy
pyranoanthocyanins (analogues of vitisin A or B) with a substituted
cinnamaldehyde or cinnamic acid, respectively;38,39 or (d) reaction of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylflavylium (DHMF) cations
with electron-rich benzaldehydes26,34,40 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Overall Reaction of DHMF with Electron-Rich Benzaldehydes
(R = p-Methoxybenzaldehyde or p-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde)
Reported by Roehri-Stoeckel et al.40 and
Chassaing et al26,34
Of these synthetic routes, the last would potentially
represent
the most attractive and perhaps the most general route to substituted
pyranoflavylium ions if the reported limitation of the reaction only
to benzaldehydes bearing electron-rich substituents26,34 could be overcome. In the present work, we report several modifications
of the reaction conditions, along with several improvements in the
product purification procedure, which now make this synthetic route
viable for the more general preparation of pyranoflavylium cations,
including those prepared from benzaldehydes with strong electron-withdrawing
substituents.

2 Results and Discussion
As reported by Chassaing et al.,26,34,40 the reaction of the DHMF cation with electron-rich
benzaldehydes such as p-methoxybenzaldehyde or p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde proceeded smoothly in ethanol
to produce the corresponding substituted pyranoflavylium ions in good
overall yield and in an essentially pure form. However, in contrast
to the results of Chassaing et al.26,34 for the hexafluorophosphate
salt of DHMF, in our hands the chloride salt of DHMF also reacted
quite well with benzaldehyde, 2-naphthaldehyde, and even with benzaldehydes
containing electron-withdrawing substituents such as p-cyanobenzaldehyde or p-nitrobenzaldehyde to yield
the corresponding substituted pyranoflavylium cations. If this difference
were attributable to a role of the chloride counterion acting, for
example, as a weak base catalyst, the addition of a small amount of
sodium bicarbonate should potentially improve the reaction. However,
the addition of 1.5 mmol (3 equiv) of sodium bicarbonate to the reaction
mixture inhibited almost completely the reaction of DHMF with p-cyanobenzaldehyde. This suggested the possibility that
the important factor might be the presence of residual acidity (as
HCl) in the chloride salt of DHMF. Indeed, the DHMF employed by us
is routinely prepared by the condensation of phloroglucinol (1,3,5-benzenetriol)
with benzoylacetone in acetic acid saturated with dry gaseous HCl
and isolated by precipitation with ethyl ether.

Scheme 3 outlines
a plausible reaction sequence, initiated by the deprotonation of the
methyl group at the 4-carbon of DHMF. This is consistent with the
facile hydrogen–deuterium exchange of the methyl group in acidified
perdeuteromethanol.40 Because the attack
of the resultant methylene on the aldehyde should form a hemiacetal,
the first modifications of the reaction conditions reported by Chassaing
et al.26,34 was the deliberate addition of 1 mM trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) to ensure the presence of an acid catalyst to favor the
cyclization of the hemiacetal. In ethanol, TFA should be a much weaker
acid than in water,45−48 by about 5 pK units, whereas the pKa of the methyl group of the cationic flavylium of DHMF
should be increased by perhaps only about one pK unit.48 This should attenuate the effect of TFA on the
initial deprotonation equilibrium of DHMF, while still allows it to
act as an efficient acid catalyst in the subsequent dehydration–cyclization
steps. The second modification was to employ a fourfold molar excess
of the aldehyde to shift the second equilibrium in favor of the hemiacetal.
The third modification was to conduct the reaction under an inert
atmosphere during the first two hours of the reaction to delay the
onset of the autoxidative aromatization of the dihydropyran intermediate
to give the final pyranoflavylium ion.

Scheme 3 Outline of the Proposed
Mechanism of Reaction of DHMF with Aromatic
Aldehydes
The addition of TFA
solved two of the problems initially encountered
in the reactions between DHMF and benzaldehydes with electron-withdrawing
substituents such as 4-nitrobenzaldehyde or 4-cyanobenzaldehyde, viz.,
somewhat erratic yields of the products and the incomplete reaction
even after 24 h. Implementation of the other two modifications largely
prevented the formation of the two principal side products produced
in the reactions with aldehydes bearing electron-withdrawing substituents
in the presence of TFA alone. One of these side products, with two
additional hydrogen atoms in its structure (as detected by unit resolution
mass spectrometry), was a presumably residual dihydropyran intermediate
that had not yet undergone autoxidative aromatization. Because aromatic
aldehydes are known to be excellent mediators of autoxidation upon
exposure to air,49,50 this constituted an additional
rationale for employing excess aldehyde in the reaction mixture. The
other side product, which apparently conserved the flavylium chromophore,
had four additional hydrogen atoms. Four of its hydrogen atoms were
exchanged for deuterium in perdeuteromethanol, including two OH groups
and two acidic methylene hydrogens adjacent to the flavylium chromophore.
These observations suggested that this side product resulted from
the reduction of the 4-arylvinyl intermediate (on the left in the
brackets in Scheme 3) by adventitious radical species49,50 generated
concurrently during the autoxidative aromatization step. Indeed, conducting
the initial two hours of the reaction under an inert atmosphere to
delay the onset of autoxidation until after cyclization to the dihydropyran
intermediate had occurred nicely eliminated the significant formation
of this second side product.

In the product workup, excess aldehyde
could be recovered by washing
the product with ethyl ether after the removal of the solvent (ethanol)
under vacuum. Because DHMF is highly soluble in aqueous solutions
and all of the pyranoflavylium ions prepared thus far are only modestly
soluble in water at best, the product purification was further improved
by washing the final product with ice-cold dilute aqueous HCl to remove
any residual DHMF.

Although Chassaing et al.40 originally
proposed a reaction pathway equivalent to that outlined in Scheme 3, they subsequently
postulated26,34 the involvement of a specific
charge-transfer interaction between DHMF and electron-rich benzaldehydes
to rationalize the apparent lack of reaction with electron-poor benzaldehydes.
Nonetheless, by implementing three modifications of their reaction
conditions that are compatible with the mechanism in Scheme 3, we were able to extend the
scope of the reaction to a wide range of substituted benzaldehydes,
as well as to other types of aromatic aldehydes (Table 1). Consequently, the results
of the present work suggest that such a charge-transfer interaction,
though not necessarily excluded for electron-rich benzaldehydes, is
clearly not the dominant factor controlling reactivity.

3 Conclusions
The procedure described here permits the relatively facile preparation
of a wide variety of substituted pyranoflavylium cations, including
those with attached heterocyclic and polycyclic aromatic rings, opening
the way for studies of substituent and structural effects on the ground-state
and excited-state acidities and other relevant properties such as
redox potentials of these pyranoanthocyanin analogues. Because the
substituted 7-hydroxyflavylium cations exhibit virtually all of the
salient features of the chemistry and photochemistry of naturally
occurring anthocyanin pigments, the behavior of these pyranoflavylium
cations should mirror fundamental aspects of the chemistry and photophysics
of the pyranoanthocyanin chromophores present in mature red wines.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Product purity
was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography photodiode
array on a Promosil C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm)
at 30 °C, eluting at 0.8 mL/min with a gradient of solvent A,
0.05% formic acid (Merck) in H2O, and solvent B, 0.05%
formic acid (Fluka) in acetonitrile (Merck HPLC grade). The gradient
employed was 15–100% solvent B from 0 to 20 min and 100% solvent
B from 20 to 30 min. All compounds were characterized on the basis
of 1H and 13C NMR spectra recorded at 500 and
128 MHz, respectively, and reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield
from the solvent methanol-d4 (MeOD; δ
3.31 for 1H NMR and δ 49.15 for 13C NMR;
Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1% deutero TFA-d1 (Sigma-Aldrich). The signal of the residual water in methanol (δ
4.70 in the 1H NMR) was suppressed using the ZGPR pulse
sequence. Multiplicities are indicated as s (singlet), br s (broad
singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet), and dd (double
of doublets). After an initial check of purity by unit resolution
mass spectrometry (Bruker amaZon SL ion trap), high-resolution mass
spectra (HRMS) were determined by electrospray ionization time of
flight (ESI-TOF) at the Central Analytical Facility of the Instituto
de Química, USP (CA-IQ-USP). UV–visible spectra were
recorded on a HP8452A diode array spectrometer in spectroquality acetonitrile
(Merck) containing 0.1 mM TFA as a function of solute concentration
to ensure linearity of the Lambert–Beer relationship.

4.2 Preparation of DHMF Chloride
The
flavylium salt, an orange solid, was prepared in 85% yield from the
reaction of equimolar amounts of phloroglucinol and benzoylacetone
in acetic acid at room temperature, as described by Chassaing et al.,26 modified by saturating the solution with gaseous
HCl rather than employing HPF6 as the acid catalyst. After
precipitation of the product by adding ethyl ether, subsequent washing
with ethyl ether, and drying in vacuum, the identity of the crystalline
product was confirmed by comparing the NMR spectra with those reported
by Roehri-Stoeckel et al.40 in perdeuteromethanol
and Chassaing et al.26 in acetonitrile-d3 and by HRMS (ESI-TOF, in methanol, positive
ion mode) m/z: [M – Cl–]+ calcd for C16H13O3, 253.0870; found, 253.0858. 1H NMR (MeOD/1%

160.61, 136.41, 131.18, 130.48, 129.77, 115.39, 114.60, 104.42, 96.83,
(25.63?). The peaks due
to the methyl group at C-4 are absent in the 1H NMR, as
has been reported in the literature,40 and
very weak (tentatively identified as the small peak at δ 25.62)
in the 13C NMR because of the rapid exchange of the methyl
hydrogens for deuterium in MeOH-d4.

4.3 General Procedure for the Condensation of
DHMF Chloride with Aromatic Aldehydes (Scheme 3 and Table 1)
The aromatic aldehyde (2 mmol or 4 equiv)
was added to a solution of DHMF (0.144 g, 0.5 mmol) in 100 mL of ethanol
(EtOH, Merck) containing 1 mM TFA (Sigma-Aldrich). Benzaldehyde and
4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde were obtained from Merck; the remaining
aromatic aldehydes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The solution
was heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h before opening
to the atmosphere to initiate the autoxidative aromatization of the
pyran ring. The progress of the reaction was monitored periodically
by thin-layer chromatography (Sigma precoated silica gel plates with
a 254 nm fluorescent indicator; developed with 2:5 or 4:5 ethyl acetate/heptane).
When complete conversion was observed (generally 24 h heating was
employed), the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and
EtOH was removed under vacuum. The resulting residue was washed with
diethyl ether (Synth, Brazil) to remove excess aromatic aldehyde,
followed by ice-cold 0.001 M aqueous HCl to remove any traces of unreacted
or partially reacted flavylium salt, to give the expected pyranoflavylium
ions as chloride salts in a pure form.
