As
a common kind of food, pepper is well known for its special
effects on the physiological state of human individuals. Capsaicin,
the main component of pepper, is speculated to be linked with intestinal
microorganisms on account of their direct contact. Herein, we first
utilized mouse models and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to compare
the differences in intestinal
flora between mouse groups with and without capsaicin treatment by
gavage. The mice in the two groups showed significantly distinct performance
in terms of body weight, leukocyte count, fecal humidity, and constituent
ratios of intestinal bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia, Roseburia, Helicobacter, and Bacteroides species. In particular, the Faecalibacterium abundance was the most highly variable
among the 5 bacterial genera. Based on statistical analysis and comparison,
the variation tendency of body weight, leukocyte count, and fecal
humidity was closely related to the bacteria. In conclusion, capsaicin
could affect the physiological state of mice by changing the constitution
of the intestinal flora.

==== Body
Introduction
As the intestinal flora plays a key role
in the process of human
immunity, nutrition, and metabolism, the intestinal flora is considered
an “organ” equivalent in the human body and has attracted
much attention in recent years. The human intestine provides a good
habitat for microorganisms, harboring more than 1000 kinds of symbiotic
microorganisms. The number of microorganisms in the adult intestine
is not only much larger than that of microorganisms on the body surface
but also 10 times the number of human cells.1 Many studies have verified that the intestinal flora is closely
related to the health of the host, which affects the metabolic phenotype2−4 as well as the immunoregulation.5,6 Diet stands
out among all the factors contributing to the adjustment of the intestinal
microbial structure. The intestinal microecology was directly and
dynamically influenced by different dietary species and quantities.7 The metabolites generated from undigested food
by intestinal microorganisms own a potential impact on human health,
which acts as a key bridge between diet and human health.8

The balance of the intestinal flora is
closely related to human
health. Lu et al.9,10 and Qin et al.11 found intestinal flora imbalance in H7N9 avian influenza
patients. Qin et al.12 used metagenomic
technology and found that type II diabetes has symptoms of moderate
intestinal microecological imbalance, decreased abundance of butyric
acid bacteria and increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens.
It is also noted that 23 strains may serve as biomarkers to distinguish
between type II diabetes patients and healthy people. Delzenne et
al.13 found that intestinal barrier function
damage is one of the causes of obesity and type II diabetes.14 In 2009, the Zhao Liping Laboratory studied
the effects of a high-fat diet and a normal diet on intestinal microorganisms
and metabolism in normal mice and gene knockout mice. After sequencing
the DNA of the intestinal flora by a high-throughput sequencing technique,
it was found that the phylogenetic relationship of the intestinal
flora community was basically consistent with that reflected by full-length
16S rRNA gene analysis.15,16 A study in 2014 by
Duca et al.17 found that obese mice had
a higher proportion of thick-walled bacteria/Bacteroides species than obesity-resistant mice under the same diet and that
there were three unique “fat bacteria”, Oscillibacter and Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, in obese mice. When transplanted into sterile
mice, the intestinal flora of obese mice was able to successfully
replicate the obesity phenotypes. In 2016, Zhu et al.18 found that intestinal microorganisms directly promote platelet
hypersensitivity by producing trimethylamine N-oxide,
which increases the risk of thrombosis. In addition, intestinal microorganisms
are also associated with common human diseases, such as liver disease,19−21 intestinal diseases,22,23 and nervous system diseases.24,25

Pepper is more and more popular in our daily diet in these
years.
Following different cultures and climates, people in different regions
possess different eating habits for pepper. It is observed that pepper
consumption frequently worsens the physiological states of human individuals,
such as sore throat, mouth ulcer, constipation, acne, and so on, which
were summarized as “getting inflamed”. Nevertheless,
relevant research studies and mechanisms have not yet been clearly
illuminated. In view of the facts that the close relationship among
intestinal flora, human health, and pepper, it is of significance
to explore the series of influence brought by pepper consumption.

In this study, we first used the mouse intestine to simulate the
human intestine to study the effects of dietary habits associated
with pepper on the intestinal flora. Through 16S rRNA high-throughput
sequencing, we compared the differences in intestinal flora between
mouse groups with and without pepper consumption. The mice in the
two groups showed significantly distinct performance in terms of body
weight, leukocyte count, fecal humidity, and constituent ratios of
intestinal bacteria. Furthermore, the variation tendency of body weight,
leukocyte count, and fecal humidity were closely related to the intestinal
flora. In conclusion, capsaicin could affect the physiological state
of mice by changing the constitution of the intestinal flora. Our
study not only provided insight into the relationship between pepper
and the intestinal flora but also provided a significant foundation
for research on the effects of a variety of foods on human health.

Results
and Discussion
Effects of capsaicin on mice body weight.
As shown in Figure 1, after gastric perfusion,
the average body weight of Cap M raised 9.6% from day 4, while those
in the control group declined 18.3% after day 2. Compared to male
mice, the body weight of female mice changed slightly. For female
mice, the body weight of Cap F slightly decreased, but Ctrl F did
not change significantly after gavage.

Figure 1 Body weight changes of
mice. (A) Capsaicin-treated mice were continuously
given gastric perfusion of capsaicin solution for one week, and their
body weight was measured daily. (B) Control mice were given the same
volume of soybean oil for one week and weighed daily.

Effects of capsaicin on blood leukocyte content in mice.
From the
variation tendency on day 2 in Figure 2, the number of blood leukocytes among all the 4 groups
of mice decreased consistently than day 0. For the male mice, the
leukocyte counts of the capsaicin-treated ones began to increase to
a maximum after day 2, and the controlled ones increased after day
4 and decreased after day 6. For the female mice, the leukocyte numbers
in the two groups fell between day 0 and day 2 and increased between
day 2 and day 8. O’Keefe et al.23 reported that gastric perfusion of capsaicin could enhance short-term
hematopoietic function. Therefore, gastric perfusion of capsaicin
might be the cause of the upward trend in the leukocyte content from
day 2.

Figure 2 Blood leukocyte count changes of mice. Blood leukocytes on days
0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 in each mouse were counted, and the average of each
group along with the error bars is plotted on the graph.

Effects of capsaicin on fecal water content in mice. In regard
to male mice, the fecal moisture content of Cap M increased from 62.4
to 62.9%, while Ctrl M declined from 63.9 to 51.1% after 2 days (Figure 3). As for female
mice, the fecal moisture content of Cap F fluctuated in a range from
54.2 to 67.4%. Besides, the moisture content range of Ctrl F was relatively
small, ranging from 55.0 to 65.0%.

Figure 3 Content change of water in mouse feces.
The fecal moisture content
on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 of each group of mice was calculated and
plotted to create a line graph.

A preliminary speculation observed from Cap M is that capsaicin
may stimulate water intake, while soybean oil may inhibit the desire
to drink in the control group. Consequently, the moisture content
in the capsaicin group was higher than that in the control group.
There exists the possibility that capsaicin may have practical influence
on the original intestinal microflora of the mice. The demands for
water consumption after the flora variation differ as well, resulting
in a noteworthy difference in the fecal moisture content. The fecal
moisture content affects the physical properties of the feces, such
as softness and dryness. It is recognized that dry and hard feces
easily lead to rectum and anus damage because of friction, which would
cause a series of health problems further, such as constipation, hemorrhoids,
and even intestinal cancer.

Effects of capsaicin on the intestinal
flora in mice. Figure 4 reflected the relative
abundance of the intestinal flora constituents of each mouse at the
genus level basing on high-throughput sequencing. The composition
of intestinal microbes in each mouse experiment was visually depicted.
From the fecal metagenome analysis of the capsaicin-treated ones,
it was concluded that several kinds of bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia species, owned obvious variation trends at the genus level. It is
worth noting that, Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia are reported as immune
regulation and body weight control related factors to human health.26−32

Figure 4 Intestinal
flora sequencing results (genus level). Mice feces were
collected during the experiment, and the relative frequency of the
intestinal flora components was subsequently obtained by high-throughput
sequencing. The relative frequency of intestinal flora constituents
at the genus level in mice fecal samples collected on different dates
is shown.

According to the analysis of the
intestinal flora uniformity (Figure 5), the evenness of
the capsaicin group was significantly higher than that of the control
group (P < 0.001). It can be concluded that capsaicin
affects the number of intestinal flora constituents in mice.

Figure 5 Effects of
capsaicin on the evenness of the intestinal microbiota
in mice. Box plot showed the difference in Pielou’s evenness
index of the mouse intestinal flora between the capsaicin group and
the control group.

According to Figure 6, the intestinal
microflora difference among the mice in the capsaicin
group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (P = 0.002). In combination with Figure 5, administration of capsaicin via gavage
changed the structure of the intestinal flora of mice and made it
more evenly distributed.

mice in each group
based on unweighted UniFrac distance.

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the
only known species of Faecalibacterium, is a Gram-positive bacterium and is one of the most highly enriched
and most important symbiotic bacteria in the human intestinal microbiome.33,34 This species boosts the immune system26 and is associated with Crohn’s disease, obesity, asthma,
and major depressive disorder.27,28,35,36 As shown in Figure 7A, Faecalibacterium appeared in the capsaicin group but not the control group, suggesting
that capsaicin was an important factor for Faecalibacterium existence in the intestinal flora of the capsaicin group mice. It
can be seen from Figure 7A that in the capsaicin group, the changes in abundance of Faecalibacterium in the intestines of male and female
mice were different. The Faecalibacterium content in the male mice increased gradually with gastric perfusion
of the capsaicin solution, while that in the female mice showed a
tendency to increase first and then disappear. The abovementioned
changes reminded us that the effects of capsaicin on the intestinal Faecalibacterium content in mice was sex sensitive.

Figure 7 Changes
in intestinal flora composition. (A–E) Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia, Roseburia, Helicobacter, and Bacteroides were screened according
to the sequencing results, and the curve was fitted according to their
relative levels in the intestinal flora of each mouse.

Figures 1A
and 7A indicated that the changing trend of
mice body
weight in the capsaicin group was consistent with the content of the
intestinal Faecalibacterium. It is
a remarkable fact that Faecalibacterium is obesity related.27,28 Hence, it could be speculated
that capsaicin might play a particular role in the body weight of
male mice. Moreover, the Faecalibacterium content increased with gastric perfusion of capsaicin, which further
led to body weight gain in male mice. Basing on above findings, it
is worth conducting additional research studies focusing on the relationship
between Faecalibacterium and capsaicin
with larger samples. In the near future, it is also significant and
necessary to examine the body weight variation tendency with Faecalibacterium among human volunteers in response
to spicy diet.

Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is currently the
only known species
in the Akkermansia genus and exists
in the human intestine. The results of the International Cooperative
Human Twins study showed that decreased A. muciniphila abundance was related to increasing risk of diabetes mellitus and
obesity.29 The Akkermansia content of the intestines of mice in the capsaicin group reduced,
when the body weight showed an opposite trend (Figure 7B). The Akkermansia content of Cap F decreased first and then increased, and the body
weight of these mice exhibited a downward tendency. The flora content
of the mice in the control group showed an upward trend, while that
of the female mice showed no obvious trend (Figure 7B). It can be concluded that the effect of
capsaicin on the Akkermansia content
of the intestine in mice is sex sensitive. Based on Figures 1 and 7B, it could be concluded that the Akkermansia content of the intestinal flora and body weight may be inversely
proportional to each other. In addition, the changing trend of the Akkermansia content in the intestines of Cap M was
similar to that of the blood leukocyte count (Figure 2), which decreased first and then increased.
Caesar suggested that the Akkermansia genus could reduce inflammation in the body.37 After gastric perfusion for 2 days, the leukocyte count
increased, and the Akkermansia content
decreased. After 8 days, the leukocyte count and Akkermansia content both exhibited an upward trend. To sum up, capsaicin might
cause inflammation in the body along with an increase in the leukocyte
count in mice by affecting the abundance of Akkermansia bacteria in the intestine.

Roseburia species are Gram-positive
anaerobic bacteria that produce butyrate and inhabit the human colon.
Increasing abundance of Roseburia species
is associated with body weight loss and reduced glucose intolerance
in mice.30 Capsaicin enhanced the Roseburia content in the intestines of the mice and
decreased the intestinal Roseburia content
in female mice, indicating that the effect of capsaicin on the Roseburia content in the intestines of the mice was
also sex sensitive (Figure 7C). According to Figures 1 and 7C, the Roseburia content of the intestine in mice might
be inversely proportional to the mice body weight. In conclusion,
capsaicin may have an effect on mice body weight by altering the amount
of Roseburia in mice.

Helicobacter pylori is the most
widely known species of Helicobacter, which is Gram-negative and infects up to 50% of the population.
Some strains of these bacteria are pathogenic to humans because they
are closely related to peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, duodenal
inflammation, and gastric cancer.38,39Figure 7D revealed that the Helicobacter content in the capsaicin group was lower
than that in the control group, and it was concluded that capsaicin
might reduce the Helicobacter content
in the intestines of mice to a certain extent. Because Helicobacter has a certain pathogenicity, it is believed
that capsaicin may reduce the probability of disease caused by Helicobacter in the body by inhibiting the activity
of H. pylori.

Bacteroides is a genus of Gram-negative,
obligate anaerobic bacteria that play an important role in the processing
of complex molecules into simpler molecules in the host intestine.
Previous literature suggested that members of Bacteroides could affect thin or obese phenotypes in humans.31 According to Figure 7E, the Bacteroides content
in the intestines of Cap M decreased when compared with that of Ctrl
M, while that of the female mice exhibited relatively little change.
It could be considered that there was a sex-based difference in the
effect of capsaicin on the Bacteroides content. The mice body weight variation of the capsaicin group was
different between male and female. Therefore, it was believed that Bacteroides content might be associated with mice
body weight.

In this study, we came to the conclusion finally
that capsaicin
could affect the composition and content of the intestinal flora in
mice. There were inconsistencies in the change trends of the intestinal
flora between male and female mice, which implied gender sensitivity.
Additionally, the changes in the intestinal flora of mice caused by
capsaicin might be involved in altering the body weight of mice. After
gastric perfusion of capsaicin solution, initially absent Faecalibacterium, recognized as obesity-related bacterium,
was detected in the intestines of male and female mice. Furthermore,
the body weight of the male mice as well as the content of Faecalibacterium in their intestines increased consistently.

Materials
and Methods
Animals
Male and female ICR clean-grade mice, aged
3 weeks were purchased from Wu’s Laboratory Animal (Fuzhou,
China), fed with basic feed, and provided free access to drinking
water in the test environment for one week to adapt. The Animal Care
and Use Committee of the College of Biological Science and Engineering,
FuZhou University, approved the experimental protocols in this study.

Pharmacy
To prepare the capsaicin solution, synthesized
capsaicin (97% capsaicin, provided by Sinopharm, China) was dissolved
in soybean oil (edible grade) to form 0.8 mg/mL capsaicin solution.
To prepare the leukocyte diluent, 0.1 mL of 25% glutaraldehyde was
added to 100 mL of 12% glacial acetic acid and mixed evenly.40

Animal Treatment
The capsaicin-administered
mice were
assigned into the control group and capsaicin group (fed with capsaicin-soybean
oil solution). In the capsaicin group, 3 male mice were termed Cap
M while 3 female mice were termed Cap F. In the control group, 3 male
mice were termed Ctrl M and 3 female mice were termed Ctrl F. The
capsaicin group was treated with gastric perfusion (capsaicin of 8
mg/kg/d mice body weight) from 16:00 to 17:00 for one week. The control
group was fed with the corresponding volume of soybean oil solution
at the same time. The body weight data were collected daily, and the
blood leukocyte content, fecal water content, and intestinal flora
composition of the mice were measured at days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

DNA Isolation, PCR, and 16S rRNA Gene Analysis
DNA
extraction of mouse feces was accomplished by using a fecal DNA extraction
kit (Weiyin, China), followed by using the bacterial 16S rRNA V3–V4
primers (upstream primer: 5′ CCTAYGGGRBGCAAG 3 ′, downstream
primer: 5′ GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT 3 ′) to amplify the
DNA template. PCR amplification was conducted in a total volume of
10 μL containing 5 μL of 2× Taq PCR Mix (CWbio, China),
0.4 μL of each primer, 0.5 μL of DNA template, and 3.7
μL of ddH2O. PCRs were performed under the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles
of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30
s; and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min.

The Vazyme
Universal DNA Library Prep Kit for ILLUMINAV2 was used to prepare
libraries of the PCR amplification products for next-generation sequencing.
The paired-end 250-bp mode of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer was
used. Then, the sequencing results were analyzed using the QIIME2
software package.41

Determination of Immune
Indicators
Twenty microliters
of blood was collected from each mouse using the tail tip-cutting
method and then mixed with 0.38 mL of leukocyte diluent. A small amount
of suspension was dripped into the counting pool of a hemocytometer,
and then, the number of leukocytes was counted via microscopy.

Determination
of Water Content in Feces
A tube of feces
was collected from each mouse cage at 9:00 every morning. The net
weight of each tube was controlled in the range of 180–210
mg, which was recorded as the wet weight. After weighing, tubes with
opened lips were placed in an oven and dried at 80 °C for 24
h. Then, the weight was measured again and recorded as dry weight.
