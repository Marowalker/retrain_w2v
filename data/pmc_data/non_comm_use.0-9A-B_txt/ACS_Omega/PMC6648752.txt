Nanostructured
hydrated vanadium oxides (V2O5·nH2O) are actively being researched
for applications in energy storage, catalysis, and gas sensors. Recently,
a one-step exfoliation technique for fabricating V2O5·nH2O nanosheets in aqueous
media was reported; however, the underlying mechanism of exfoliation
has been challenging to study. Herein, we followed the synthesis of
V2O5·nH2O nanosheets
from the V2O5 and VO2 precursors
in real time using solution- and solid-state 51V NMR. Solution-state 51V NMR showed that the aqueous solution contained mostly the
decavanadate anion [H2V10O28]4– and the hydrated dioxovanadate cation [VO2·4H2O]+, and during the exfoliation process,
decavanadate was formed, while the amount of [VO2·4H2O]+ remained constant. The conversion of the solid
precursor V2O5, which was monitored with solid-state 51V NMR, was initiated when VO2 was in its monoclinic
forms. The dried V2O5·nH2O nanosheets were weakly paramagnetic because of a minor
content of isolated V4+. Its solid-state 51V
signal was less than 20% of V2O5 and arose from
diamagnetic V4+ or V5+.This study demonstrates
the use of real-time NMR techniques as a powerful analysis tool for
the exfoliation of bulk materials into nanosheets. A deeper understanding
of this process will pave the way to tailor these important materials.

1 Introduction
In
the last few years, the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) materials
based on transition metal chalcogenides and oxides with thicknesses
of a few layers has attracted renewed attention because of the different
chemical, physical, and semiconducting properties of these materials
compared to their bulk (three-dimensional, 3D) counterparts.1−3 Vanadium oxides are earth-abundant compounds, which have important
applications in catalysis,4 batteries,5−7 supercapacitors,8−10 and sensors.11 Thus, many
research groups have focused on the synthesis of 2D vanadium oxides
from their bulk precursors.12−14 Of particular interest among
these 2D materials are those based on the hydrated vanadium pentoxides
(V2O5·nH2O),
which have been shown to exhibit improved electrochemical behavior
and semiconducting properties compared to anhydrous V2O5.15 The improvements are typically
ascribed to the presence of H2O or H+ ions between
the V2O5 layers in V2O5·nH2O, which can be synthesized
in the form of hydrogels,16 xerogels,17,18 nanobelts,19 and nanosheets.5−7 Nanostructured V2O5·nH2O has attracted research interest as it can be easily
fabricated into a freestanding film,5 which
is easier to handle than, and is thus advantageous compared to, an
amorphous or crystalline powder or gel.

V2O5·nH2O is commonly synthesized either
by an ion-exchange route using sodium
metavanadate solution or via a sol–gel route using a mixture
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and V2O5.20,21 In both cases, a dark red compound
is formed with a layered structure. Recently, Etman et al. synthetized
V2O5·nH2O nanosheets
using aqueous exfoliation of a mixture of V2O5 and VO2, resulting in black/green films.7 The synthesis was monitored by in situ X-ray diffraction
(XRD) studies, which revealed that the V2O5·nH2O phase started to form after 90 min of reflux
in water at 80 °C. A more detailed understanding of the underlying
mechanism of the formation of this V2O5·nH2O product is challenging because vanadium
is a transition metal with a very complex chemistry and many different
stable oxidation states.21 As XRD and wide-angle
X-ray scattering provide data mainly on the long-range order in compounds,
other techniques are important to assess developments in noncrystalline
materials or at the solid–liquid interface during the reaction.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a characterization technique
complementary to XRD and has been used to study the ion-exchange or
sol–gel synthesis routes of V2O5·nH2O.22−26 It can provide information about the local order, coordination states,
and protonated or deprotonated oxygen atoms. Typically, solid compounds
are monitored by magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state (ss)-NMR,
whereas solution-state NMR is used to observe dissolved compounds.
However, both solid- and solution-state 51V NMR are complicated
by localized unpaired electrons in paramagnetic V4+ ions,
which may bleach out the signal arising from the NMR detectable (diamagnetic) 51V5+ ions in various ways.27 MAS ss-NMR is able to distinguish between delocalized (metallic)
and localized (paramagnetic) electronic states via Knight shifts and
paramagnetic shifts.28 Paramagnetic, which
refers here to Curie or Curie–Weiss paramagnetism, V4+ ions with localized unpaired electrons cannot be directly studied
with NMR, but their presence has the effect of bleaching the 51V signal of nearby V5+ ions, allowing the presence
of V4+ to be probed indirectly. However, V4+ ions with localized unpaired electrons can be studied by other techniques,
for example, electron spin resonance (ESR). When the V4+ ions are less than 2.7 Å apart, their unpaired electrons may
pair and turn the corresponding materials from paramagnetic to diamagnetic,
which does give a detectable 51V4+ NMR signal.27,29,30

In this paper, we report
on real-time solid- and solution-state 51V NMR studies
performed during the synthesis of V2O5·nH2O nanosheets from
a 1:4 mixture by weight of commercial monoclinic VO2(M)
and V2O5. The interpretation of the 51V NMR results was linked with those from ESR and 1H NMR
and used to elucidate the mechanism of the aqueous exfoliation process
and formation of V2O5·nH2O nanosheets.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Structure of V2O5·nH2O Nanosheets
The V2O5·nH2O nanosheets were synthesized
in water from a 1:4 mixture by weight
of monoclinic VO2(M) and commercial V2O5, and the chemical and thermal analyses are described elsewhere.7 The XRD pattern (Figure 1a, gray) of the as-prepared V2O5·nH2O nanosheets displayed
broad peaks, which were indexed as 00l, reflecting
the preferred orientation of the layered structure of the nanosheets.
This pattern was recorded in a reflection configuration using an in-house diffractometer (λ = 1.5406 Å). One possible
solution to overcome the preferred orientation was to perform XRD
in transmission mode with, for example, a high-energy X-ray source
(synchrotron radiation, λ = 0.7766 Å). Notably, the XRD
pattern (see Figure 1a, black) recorded in this way was very similar to that collected
in the reflection mode using an in-house diffractometer,
suggesting a disordered stacking between V2O5·nH2O layers over the a–b plane. Interestingly, the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that V2O5·nH2O had a typical nanosheet morphology
with a different lateral size thickness ranging from 30 to 220 nm
(see Figure 1b). In
addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of
V2O5·nH2O had
powder rings (see Figure 1c), which provided additional support for disordered stacking
between the layers over the a–b plane.

radiation (black) and low-energy X-ray reflection (gray) mode. The
remaining traces of the V2O5 phase are marked
by “*”. To the right, the TEM image (b) and SAED (c)
of the V2O5·nH2O nanosheets are shown. In (c), the inset shows the crystals from
which SAED was obtained.

2.1.1 Local Structure of V2O5·nH2O Nanosheets
MAS ss-NMR
can provide fruitful information about the local structure and oxidation
states of metal ions. The commercial V2O5 precursor
possessed a layered anisotropic structure of distorted VO6 octahedral building units,13,31 and its 51V isotropic shift was −611 ppm (see Figure 2, black).27 The
isotropic shift of the largely disordered nanosheets of V2O5·nH2O was slightly
lower in magnitude, −596 ppm, and the spinning side band manifold
was broader, having nearly double the number of spinning side bands
(see Figure 2, red).
In addition, the individual side bands exhibited an increased inhomogeneous
line width, which suggested highly distorted geometries of the vanadium
sites. The enhanced line width was in agreement with observations
from XRD and SAED.

Figure 2 Weight-normalized 51V MAS ss-NMR spectra of
V2O5 (black) and V2O5·nH2O nanosheets (red). The signal intensity for
V2O5·nH2O is
scaled up by a factor of 20. The isotropic shift is marked by “+”.

In previous NMR studies of 
V2O5·nH2O gels,
synthesized using H2O2-based or ion-exchange
methods, up to five different 51V NMR peaks have been observed
and attributed to various
vanadium sites.32,33 The corresponding 51V isotropic shifts have been in the interval of −572 to −663
ppm. However, in this study, the intrinsic and symmetric 51V line width of the 51V NMR peaks of the nanosheets of
V2O5·nH2O exceeded
80 ppm and thus prevented potential multiple vanadium sites from being
resolved. On the basis of previous studies,32 the 51V isotropic shift of the nanosheets of V2O5·nH2O suggested octahedral
vanadium sites with one water molecule bonded to the vanadyl oxygen
or vanadium pentoxide with shifted subunits.

Notably, the integral
intensity of the total 51V signal
including the spinning side band manifold of the V2O5·nH2O nanosheets was less
than 20% of the V2O5 precursor. The broad line
width of the side bands means that the second-order quadrupolar broadening
cannot be measured from the line shape, and the contributions of the
first-order quadrupolar interaction and shift anisotropy to the spinning
side band manifold cannot be easily separated; consequently, the quadrupolar
couplings were not measured.34 One possible
reason for the signal loss relative to the precursor would be a phase
transition similar to that of VO2(M)–metallic-VO2(R) because of frictional heating from MAS.35,36

The magnetic susceptibility data (see Figure S1) indicated a weak paramagnetic behavior of the nanosheets
with no observable magnetic phase transition. A fit of these data
returned a Weiss constant of zero, pure Curie paramagnetism which
we ascribe to isolated (noninteracting) V4+ ions that were
incorporated between the V2O5 nanosheets during
the course of the reaction. In turn, we ascribe the large reduction
in the observable signal from V2O5 to a paramagnetic
bleaching effect, where the nuclear relaxation of V5+ is
enhanced by the proximity of the paramagnetic V4+ ions.27 As the synthesis was performed in an aqueous
mixture of VO2(M) and V2O5, the former
provided a possible source of paramagnetic V4+, given the
1:4-fraction of VO2(M) and V2O5.
V2O5·nH2O has
been found to contain about 10 mol % of V4+ according to
Etman et al.,7 which was in agreement with
the observed weakly paramagnetic behavior. The presence of V4+ was here confirmed by ESR (see Figure S2). The corresponding spectra each had a broad peak with an isotropic g-value of 1.95 at room temperature. This value matched
well with those reported for other V4+-containing materials.23,29,37

2.1.2 Water
Molecules in V2O5·nH2O Nanosheets
The distribution
and location of H2O in V2O5·nH2O are important for the electrochemical behavior
and semiconducting properties.20,21 In relation to the
positioning of H2O, Pozarnsky and McCormick suggested a
chain model with a H2O molecule and a −OH group
in the equatorial plane and an additional H2O pointing
downward.25 Hence, we recorded a static 2H ss-NMR spectrum (see Figure 3) on the V2O5·nD2O nanosheets and observed three distinct resonances
with decreasing intensities at chemical shifts of 1, 3.3, and 7 ppm.
Similar results were obtained from 1H NMR experiments under
MAS, but the 1H background of the probe and rotor complicated
the interpretation (data not shown). Takeda et al. have observed rotational
restricted motion in hydrated V2O5 as evidenced
by the features of the 2H powder patterns.22 In this work, neither bulk H2O nor strongly
coordinated H2O could be observed. Instead, the features
of the static 2H spectrum suggested that H2O
had a high mobility. However, H2O or −OH groups
bonded or coordinated to V4+ were not easily detectable
under static conditions, as they were expected to be strongly shifted
by a Fermi-contact shift to the paramagnetic V4+ ion, exhibit
large resonance broadening, and have short relaxation times. The observed 2H chemical shifts at 3.3 and 1 ppm were attributed to D2O and −OD on the surface of the nanosheets, respectively.38 The chemical shift at 7 ppm may have been due
to −OD groups, in which the O atom bridges between two V atoms.

was recorded using a quadrupolar echo sequence.

2.2 Probing Nanosheet Formation by Real-Time 51V NMR
To elucidate the formation of nanosheets,
we applied real-time solid- and solution-state 51V NMR
to follow the reaction of the solid phases and the dissolved species
separately.

2.2.1 Dissolved Species
VO2 and V2O5 with a mass ratio of 1:4 were blended
with 550 μL of H2O and 50 μL of D2O in an NMR tube, and solution-state 51V NMR spectra were
recorded in real time during the reaction. The observed vanadium species
and their 51V shift are summarized in Table 1. It was evident that the 51V signals of the decavanadate anion [H2V10O28]4–, resonating at −419, −503,
and −522 ppm, exhibited increasing integral intensities for
up to 2 h after mixing, whereas the 51V signal of the hydrated
dioxovanadate cation [VO2·4H2O]+ at −549 ppm retained a constant integral (see Figure 4). The decavanadate anion is
believed to be produced from 10 dioxovanadate cations under acidic
conditions in aqueous solutions. However, if this reaction had occurred
here, there must also have been an additional process where dioxovanadate
cations were produced. Furthermore, the rate of its formation has
to be equal to the rate of consumption, so as to keep the overall
dioxovanadate concentration unaltered throughout the entire reaction.
It has furthermore been discussed that the decavanadate anion is not
responsible for the formation of the nanosheets because it is highly
acidic and hence would prevent further condensation reactions.39 Notably, a broad feature at a shift of about
−297 ppm was observed (see Figure 4), which Rehder has suggested to be related
to a VO2+ derivate.40 The broadening of this 51V signal might also be attributed
to polymeric vanadium species or species that contain V4+ in close vicinity.

of time.

a The peak at −297 ppm could
not be assigned.

The dioxovanadate
cation was exchanged with H2VO4–, which has a pKa of 3.8.41 It is, hence, highly likely
that the observed chemical shift of [VO2·4H2O]+ was due to an average of both the cationic and anionic
forms and is highly pH-dependent. The observed chemical shift agreed
well with the reported one at a pH of 3.8.41 The formation of the decavanadate anion produces H+,
which lowered the pH to 2.6 at the end of the reaction, which in turn
shifted the 51V signal of the dioxovanadate cation from
−550 ppm to less negative chemical shift values.

An aqueous
suspension of VO2 did not produce any 51V NMR
peaks at room temperature or 80 °C. Hence, we
assumed that all of the 51V signals (in Figure 4) including the broad peak
at −297 ppm resulted from V2O5 and its
reaction products despite its low solubility (0.7 g/L = 3.8 mmol/L
at room temperature).42 It is worth mentioning
that VO2 is, however, slightly water-soluble particularly
under acidic conditions, and the following V4+ species,
which are NMR silent, might be present: [VO·5H2O]2+, VOOH+, and a dimer VO2(OH2)2+; the latter most likely formed from the coupling of
two VOOH+ species.43 V4+ species in an aqueous VO2/V2O5 mixture
at 80 °C was confirmed by the hyperfine coupling between an electron
and 51V in the ESR spectrum showing eight peaks (see Figure S2). These features of the ESR spectrum
suggested isolated V4+ species in solution,29 most likely [VO·5H2O]2+. Furthermore, the ESR spectrum had a broad feature, which was attributed
to solid VO2, and an aqueous mixture of solely V2O5 did not give any ESR signal.

The same vanadium
species have been observed in preparations from
other approaches using ion-exchange and sol–gel methods.23−25,37 Our observations were consistent
with findings from other synthetic methods taking into account the
acidic conditions with pH = 3.8. Furthermore, the observed 51V NMR signals agreed well with earlier findings on the concentration
and pH dependence for vanadium species formed in aqueous solutions.21

Etman et al. have reported on an onset
of the V2O5·nH2O formation after 90
min using real-time XRD,7 while the formation
of decavanadate leveled out after 2.5 h. By comparing those findings
with the ones of this study, the question arose if the dissolved species
were responsible for the formation of nanosheets or if the observations
of the decavanadate anion and the dioxovanadate cation were solely
due to various side reactions of the aqueous vanadium chemistry. Many
mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of nanostructured
gels,23−25,37 and in our view, the
most relevant are those that have dealt with ion exchange.23,25 However, notably, all of them have derived these compounds from
vanadium-based species in solution, whereas here we instead started
from two commercial solid compounds (V2O5 and
VO2).

2.2.2 Solid Species
To access information
on the solid phases during the reaction, we performed real-time MAS
ss-NMR experiments on the reaction mixture (0.3 mg of VO2, 1.2 mg of V2O5, and 20 μL of H2O) at 7 kHz MAS. Analyses of the 51V NMR spectra
in Figure 5a,b showed
a reduction of the integral of the whole 51V signal spinning
side band manifold due to the V2O5 phase, which
has an isotropic chemical shift of −611 ppm. The reduction
was observed both for low-flip-angle direct excitation (Figure 5c, gray) and in a Hahn echo
experiment (Figure 5c, red). The normalized 51V NMR integrals of a repeated
Hahn echo experiment (Figure 5c, black) coincided well with the first reaction. Vanadium-containing
compounds have a very large 51V NMR shift range, which
in turn required that we moved the observation window by changing
the carrier frequency and retuning the probe to observe various species.
By comparing weight-normalized 51V MAS ss-NMR spectra of
fresh commercial VO2(M) and V2O5,
the observed broad 51V signal of VO2(M) at approximately
2100 ppm30 was consistent with <1% of
the V2O5 signal in the solid phase (see Figure S3). This intensity was lower than expected
and was ascribed to the broad 51V resonance of VO2 being harder to excite and having a shorter relaxation time than
those of V2O5. The other 51V signal
resonating at negative shift is most likely the impurity V2O5 (see Figure S3). Consequently,
an amount of approximately 0.3 mg of VO2(M) was undetectable
in the real-time MAS ss-NMR experiments. The lab-scale synthesis was
prepared under similar conditions as in real-time MAS ss-NMR experiment
and revealed traces of unexfoliated V2O5 at
the end of the synthesis, which agreed with the remaining signal in
the 51V NMR spectra detected after 38 h (see Figure 5c, red and gray), and was therefore
attributed to this unexfoliated V2O5 precursor.
Despite attempts to observe other 51V signals, for example,
from VO2, none were detected. One reason might have been
the small rotor volume of 20 μL, which required a VxOy–H2O ratio that is 17 times larger to assure a good signal-to-noise
ratio and to minimize the uncertainty of the weighed amount of solids,
as compared to the lab-scale synthesis. In total, approximately 1.5
mg of VxOy was present.

or fresh VO2 (Hahn echo red; direct excitation gray) in

echo.

Interestingly, the synthesis of
the V2O5·nH2O nanosheets failed when V2O5 was used solely
as the precursor (data not shown), suggesting
that VO2(M) or dissolved species formed from VO2(M) initiated the formation of the V2O5·nH2O nanosheets. A requirement of VO2(M) for this synthesis was proposed by Pozarnsky and McCormick who
reported on the formation of V4+ species by ion exchange
and the consumption of those during the reaction.23,41 They suggested that [V4+O·5H2O]2+ reacted with [V5+O2·4H2O]+ and formed oligomeric species, which polymerized further.
Hence, our observations of a reduction of the V2O5 signal during the course of the reaction might be explained by a
homogeneous distribution of V4+ in close vicinity of V5+ formed via polymerization rather than the consumption of
V2O5 into other species. Our proposed reaction
pathway, which is in agreement with Pozarnsky and McCormick,23,41 is illustrated in Figure 6. Alternatively, as Livage discussed, [V4+O·5H2O]2+ could intercalate between the V2O5 layers.21 This alternative
hypothesis would be possible if [V4+O·5H2O]2+ would be homogeneously distributed.

Figure 6 Proposed reaction pathways
occurring during the synthesis of V2O5·nH2O nanosheets.

It should also be noted that the synthesis reaction failed
when
aged VO2(M) was used (Figure 5c, blue). This aged compound had been stored
under ambient conditions and was consequently altered after being
in contact with air. To understand the reason behind this phenomenon,
we compared the 1H, 51V NMR, ESR spectra, and
XRD patterns of the fresh and aged VO2(M).

The XRD
pattern of the fresh sample agreed well with the standard
pattern of monoclinic VO2(M). By contrast, the XRD pattern
of the aged sample had fewer peaks, which complicated the assignment
of the formed VOx phase (Figure S4). Interestingly, the semilogarithmic plot revealed
001 and 003 reflections of the V2O5·nH2O phase in the pattern of the aged VO2(M), which matched well with previous reports on the instability
of VO2(M) under ambient conditions.44 In comparison with the 51V MAS ss-NMR spectrum
of fresh VO2(M) (see Figure S3, red) in which broad peaks resonating between 1800 and 3000 ppm
were attributed to VO2(M), the aged VO2 showed
no such peaks (see Figure S5, black), presumably
due to oxidation of the vanadium species to V2O5. On the other hand, the ESR spectrum (see Figure S2) indicated that the aged VO2 still possessed
a reasonable measurable quantity of V4+. Furthermore, the 1H NMR (data not shown) displayed a broad 1H NMR
peak for the aged VO2(M) as compared to the fresh one.
The increased 1H NMR signal intensity suggested strongly
that concurrent H2O uptake had occurred. Hence, as was
reported by Etman et al.,7 the relative
fraction of VO2(M)–V2O5 used
in the synthesis was crucial for successful exfoliation.

3 Conclusions
To summarize, real-time solid-state and
solution-state 51V NMR studies were performed to follow
the transformation of VO2 and V2O5 in aqueous dispersion into
nanosheets of V2O5·nH2O. During exfoliation, a loss of the 51V NMR signal
of V2O5 was observed, which was attributed to
a homogeneous distribution of V4+ that is in close contact
with V5+ bleaching their signals. Taken together, our findings
were consistent with a hypothesis that both V2O5 and VO2 had been dissolved and VO2 formed
as [V4+O·5H2O]2+ cations, which
were oligomerized with [V5+O2·4H2O]+ species from V2O5 and then polymerized
further. Another explanation could have been intercalation of [V4+O·5H2O]2+ between the layers of
V2O5. Additional future studies could include
real-time ESR experiments with stirring; however, such were out of
the scope of this current study.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
The V2O5·nH2O or V2O5·nD2O nanosheets were synthesized
as described in ref (7). In a typical synthesis, a mixture of 1:4 (weight ratio) of V2O4 (Fisher Scientific, UK) and V2O4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany, purity 99.9%), denoted by VO2(M), was used as the precursors. The mixture of oxides was
dispersed in water or D2O (CortecNet, 99.8%) by sonication
for 10 min and then heated under reflux at 80–90 °C for
8–24 h. At the end of heating process, a greenish black suspension
of V2O5·nH2O nanosheets was formed, which was then dried in air at 80 °C
for 5 h to obtain the V2O5·nH2O nanosheets.

For the real-time ss-NMR experiments,
0.3 mg of VO2, 1.2 mg of V2O5, and
20 μL of H2O were placed in a Kel-F insert, which
can be sealed with screws. After sealing, the mixture was sonicated
for a minute. The insert was then placed in a 4 mm rotor, which was
inserted into the spectrometer.

For the real-time solution-state
NMR experiments, VO2 and V2O5 with
a mass ratio of 1:4 were blended
with 550 μL of H2O and 50 μL of D2O. The synthesis was performed at 70 °C, and the sample tube
was spun at 20 Hz.

4.2 Methods
51V MAS NMR data
were acquired on 14.1 T (51V Larmor frequency of −157.9
MHz) and 9.4 T (Larmor frequency of −105.2 MHz) Bruker AVANCE-III
spectrometers equipped with a 4 mm or 3.2 mm triple-resonance MAS
probe. Real-time MAS 51V NMR spectra were recorded at a
MAS rate of 7 kHz, while rotors containing solely solid compounds
were spun at the rate of 14 or 24 kHz. The isotropic chemical shift
was determined by comparing 51V NMR spectra recorded at
two different spinning frequencies. An aqueous solution of sodium
metavanadate (1 mol/L) was used to externally calibrate the 51V NMR chemical shift to −574.38 ppm.45 For solid samples, the length and strength of the radio frequency
(rf) pulse were estimated using the reference solution, and a rf pulse
and a nominal flip angle of 10° were used for single pulse acquisition.
For real-time MAS experiments on the reaction mixture, the rf pulse
was calibrated on the sample itself and a 45° nominal flip angle
was used. Applied rf fields between 80 and 95 kHz and spectral widths
between 2500 and 5000 kHz were used. The carrier frequency was placed
on resonance at the isotropic shift for V2O5 as well at VO2(M) and others. The 51V longitudinal
relaxation time constants T1 for the solid
compounds were estimated to be less than a second at room temperature
and at 85 °C. Nevertheless, a repetition delay of 5 s was used
for the real-time MAS NMR measurements on the reaction mixture at
85 °C. Static 2H NMR was carried out on V2O5·nD2O nanosheets prepared
in D2O instead of H2O. A small piece of the
V2O5·nD2O nanosheets
was glued in place in a glass insert, which was inserted into the
rotor. The 2H NMR spectra were recorded without spinning,
and a quadrupolar echo pulse sequence was used. For real-time solution-state
NMR measurements, V2O5 and VO2 with
a mass ratio of 4:1 were blended with 550 μL of H2O and 50 μL of D2O in a 5 mm NMR tube. The synthesis
was performed at 70 °C, and the sample tube was spun at 20 Hz.

A moderately wide Gaussian function, which was optimized to reach
close to 0 at the time point the signal had decayed, was pairwise
multiplied with the recorded free induction decays before Fourier
transformation. Unless otherwise stated, the spectral intensities
were normalized to the mass of the sample packed in the rotor. Processing
including baseline corrections was performed with in-house scripts
(MATLAB, Mathworks).

All ESR experiments were carried out on
a Bruker ELEXYS (X-band)
spectrometer at room temperature or 80 °C. Samples were studied
in a glass capillary, and the magnetic field was stepped from 1000
to 6000 gauss using two or eight signal accumulations. For heat treatment,
capillaries were flame sealed prior to storage in the oven at 80 °C.

XRD measurements were conducted in the 2θ range of 5°–45°
using a PANalytical diffractometer (Cu Kα1 radiation) and a
synchrotron source (SLS beamline, λ = 0.7766 Å). The morphology
of the nanosheets and their SAED patterns were studied by a transmission
electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100LaB6) using an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV.

pH measurements were performed with a Hanna
instrument (model-HI2210).
A Quantum Design MPMS XL SQUID (superconducting quantum interference
device) magnetometer was used for magnetic characterization. Magnetization
versus temperature measurements in a magnetic field of 1 kOe were
performed in the temperature range of 2–107 K in steps of 3
K.
