The
tailored (computational) design of materials addressing future
challenges requires a thorough understanding of their electronic structures.
This becomes very apparent for a given material existing in a certain
homogeneity range, as its particular composition influences its electronic
structure and, eventually, its physical properties. This led us to
explore the influence and, furthermore, the origin of vacancies in
the crystal structures of rock salt-type superconductors by means
of quantum-chemical techniques. In doing so, we examined the vibrational
properties, electronic band structures, and nature of bonding for
a series of superconducting transition-metal sulfides, i.e., MS (M
= Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), which were identified to exist over certain homogeneity
ranges. The outcome of our research indicates that the subtle competing
interplay between two electronically unfavorable situations at the
Fermi levels, i.e., the occupations of flat bands and the populations
of antibonding states, appears to control the presence of vacancies
in the crystal structures of the sulfides.

Introduction
To date, the full understanding of superconductivity
has posed
a challenge for chemists as well as physicists.1 Even after the first conceptions2,3 had
provided adequate explanations for this phenomenon, the discoveries4 of unanticipated superconducting states in cuprates
have raised further questions and, hence, induced massive explorative
efforts. To account for the findings of superconductivity in cuprates,
considerable attention was paid to the influence of electron spectrum
instabilities (“singularities”), which are located at
the Fermi levels of superconductors.5,6 Namely, the
aforementioned electron spectrum instabilities are assumed to induce
a structural distortion, which is counterbalanced by electrons residing
in steep bands (“flat band/steep band scenario”).7,8 The latter idea7 implies that the occurrence
of a superconducting state tends to be linked to the presence of a
flat band at the Fermi level in a given material. In this context,
one may also consider that a particular composition could affect the
position of a flat band relative to the Fermi levels in a given series
of isostructural compounds, as atomic substitutions and/or structural
defects influence the chemical compositions and, furthermore, the
electronic (band) structures within such a set of materials.9 Indeed, previous10,11 temperature-dependent
electric resistance measurements for series of isostructural compounds
revealed that metal-to-superconductor transitions are observed solely
for those species for which singularities are “pinned”
to the Fermi levels.

Besides atomic substitutions,12,13 structural
defects (“vacancies”) also influence the chemical compositions,
electronic band structures, and, ultimately, the physical properties
of compounds existing over certain homogeneity ranges. For instance,
previous research14−16 on cuprates forming over certain homogeneity ranges
showed that the presence and, furthermore, temperatures of metal-to-superconductor
transitions are linked to the amounts of oxygen vacancies in the crystal
structures. Another series of superconductors, which form over certain
homogeneity ranges, has been identified for chalcogenides crystallizing
with the rock salt-type structure.17,18 More recent
research19 on the electronic band structures
of such rock salt-type chalcogenides based on initial, defect-free
structure models revealed that flat bands were located near, but not
at the Fermi levels in several of these compounds. In the flat band/steep
band scenario,7,8 such an outcome suggested an absence
of metal-to-superconductor transitions being in stark contrast to
the experimentally determined17,18 results. This apparent
discrepancy was explained by additional investigations showing that
the locations of flat bands relative to the Fermi levels ought to
be manipulated by the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures
of these chalcogenides. But, what are the driving forces to crystallize
with compositions that are related to vacancies in the crystal structures
of the respective rock salt-type chalcogenides? To answer this question,
we sought to investigate the electronic as well as vibrational properties,
and the nature of bonding for a series of prototypical chalcogenide
superconductors, i.e., MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu). In this contribution,
we present the results of our explorations.

Computational Details
To provide an insight into the origins of the structural defects
in chalcogenide superconductors, the electronic and vibrational features
of four prototypical rock salt-type superconductors, that is, MS (M
= Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), were examined. In addition to the quantum-chemical
computations for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), the electronic and vibrational
properties were also explored for metal-deficient structure models,
i.e., M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr29S32, which were generated based on 2 × 2 × 2
expansions of the unit cells of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu). To provide
greater insight into the vibrational properties of the zirconium-containing
sulfides, the vibrational properties were also examined for Zr3S4, which has been previously reported20 to crystallize with a superstructure of the
respective rock salt-type sulfide. The compositions of the aforementioned,
metal-deficient structure models were chosen considering the experimentally
determined phase widths of the superconducting sulfides, which have
been reported elsewhere.17,18 Full structural optimizations,
which included lattice parameters and atomic positions, were carried
out for all materials using the projector-augmented wave method21 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation
package22−26 (VASP). Correlation and exchange in all computations were described
by the generalized gradient approximation of Pedrew, Burke, and Ernzerhof,27 and the energy cutoff of the plane wave basis
sets was 500 eV. In the cases of the electronic band structure computations
of constituting elements, i.e., Sc, Y, Lu, Zr, and S, sets of up to
16 × 16 × 16 k-points were used, while
sets of 16 × 16 × 16 and 8 × 8 × 8 k-points were employed for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu), Zr29S32, and
Zr3S4, respectively. All computations were considered
to have converged as the energy difference between two iterative steps
fell below 10–8 (and 10–6) eV/cell
for the electronic (and ionic) relaxations. The coordinates of the
high-symmetry k-paths within the Brillouin zones
were generated utilizing the AFLOW28 code,
and the electronic band structures of all sulfides were visualized
with the aid of the Python Materials genomics29 (pymatgen) program.

The vibrational properties of MS (M =
Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu), Zr29S32, and
Zr3S4 were examined using the Parlinski–Li–Kawazoe30 method as implemented in the Phonopy31 code. In this approach, the phonon frequencies
are determined based on force constant matrices, after the corresponding
sets of the interatomic forces have been computed within supercells,
in which a particular atom had been elongated. The interatomic forces
were calculated using VASP in the Γ-point approximation, an
approach that has largely been employed elsewhere.32−34 The supercells
employed in the computations corresponded to 4 × 4 × 4 and
2 × 2 × 2 expansions of the structurally optimized unit
cells of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and M31S32 (M
= Sc, Y, Lu), Zr3S4 as well as Zr29S32, respectively.

Chemical bonding analyses for
MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu),
and Zr29S32 were accomplished based on the crystal
orbital Hamilton populations
(COHP) and their respective integrated values. In the framework of
the COHP35,36 technique, the off-site projected densities-of-states
(DOS) are weighted with the respective Hamilton matrix elements to
indicate bonding, nonbonding, and antibonding interactions. Herein,
the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) technique,37 which is a variant of the COHP method, has been
employed. Namely, the Hamilton-weighted populations had to be projected
from the outcome of the plane-wave-based calculations with the aid
of the Local Orbital Basis Suite Towards Electronic Structure Reconstruction
program (LOBSTER35,37−39) because the
crystal orbitals, which are employed in the COHP procedure, are constructed
from local basis sets. The representations of the densities-of-states
(DOS) as well as pCOHP curves were plotted using the wxDragon40 code.

Results and Discussion
To understand
the causes of the structural defects in rock salt-type
superconductors at the atomic scale, the vibrational properties, the
electronic structures, and the nature of bonding were explored for
a series of superconducting sulfides, for which certain homogeneity
ranges have been determined. In this context, the superconducting
MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) were chosen for the examinations because previous
explorations17,18,41−43 on the existence ranges of the sulfides revealed
phase widths of 0.07 ≥ x ≥ 0, 0.05
≥ x ≥ −0.07, 0.34 ≥ x ≥ −0.11, and 0.17 ≥ x ≥ −0.33 for the superconducting, NaCl-type Sc1–xS, Y1–xS, Zr1–xS, and Lu1–xS, respectively. Furthermore, it should be noted
that additional explorations identified even metal-poorer sulfides,
i.e., Sc2S3,44 Lu3S4,45 and Zr3S4,43 whose crystal structures
were determined to be superstructures of those corresponding to the
NaCl-type sulfides.

Also, understanding the origins of the structural
defects in the
aforementioned sulfides at the atomic scale requires to reveal the
dissimilarities between the electronic and vibrational properties
of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and those of sulfides that are metal-poorer
relative to the former. To do so, the phonon band structures, electronic
band structures, and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) were
examined for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and metal-deficient models whose
crystal structures were generated based on those of MS (M = Sc, Y,
Zr, Lu). More precisely, the unit cells of the models that are metal-deficient
relative to MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) correspond to 2 × 2 ×
2 expansions of the unit cells of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) (Figure 1), but comprise one
(and three) metal atoms less per cell for M = Sc, Y, Lu, (and Zr),
respectively. Accordingly, the stoichiometry corresponding to a given
metal-deficient model (Table 1) is located within the experimentally determined homogeneity
range (see above) of the respective superconducting sulfide. To provide
an insight into the stability trends for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu), and Zr29S32, we first inspected the respective enthalpies of formation
and phonon band structures of the diverse sulfides.

Lu) and Zr29S32 ≡ Zr0.91S.
The structure models of M31S32 and Zr29S32 are derived from those of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu),
as the unit cells of M31S32 and Zr29S32 correspond to 2 × 2 × 2 expansions of the
unit cells related to MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, and Lu). In the cases of
M31S32, one transition-metal atom has been removed,
while three zirconium atoms have been eliminated, leading to the Zr29S32 model.

(M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) have been calculated for M32S32 (see the main text).

b In
the case of the zirconium-containing
species, ΔHf (Zr29S32) and three ΔHf (Zr) were
subtracted from ΔHf (Zr32S32).

Enthalpies
of Formation and Phonon Band Structures
The enthalpies of
formation at zero temperature were calculated based
on the total (electronic ground state) energies because the pressure-dependent
zero-temperature enthalpy, i.e., Hel(p) = Eel(V(p)) + pV(p), approaches Eel as the pressure vanishes.46,47 In this context, it should also be mentioned that this approach
could be used since Eel approximates the
internal energy at zero temperature.47 Thus,
the enthalpies of formation of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu), and Zr29S32 were computed by subtracting the sum of the total energies of all
constituting elements from the total energy of the respective sulfide  and  for p =
0 bar and T = 0 K. Notably, the enthalpy of formation
of the zirconium-deficient sulfide has been calculated based on total
energies of Zr29S32 and 29 zirconium atoms.
A comparison of the enthalpies of formation for all sulfides reveals
negative values of ΔHf for all materials
such that the formations of these compounds tend to be preferred.
Because the differences between ΔHf (M32S32) and ΔHf (M31S32), which have been evaluated
according to  are
positive for all inspected sulfides, one
may infer that the formations of the metal-deficient species are preferred
(note that enthalpies of formation of Zr29S32 and three zirconium atoms have been used in the case of the zirconium-containing
sulfides).

An examination of the phonon band structures and
densities-of-states for MS and M31S32 (M = Sc,
Y, Lu; Figure 2) reveals
that no negative values of the wavenumbers are evident for these sulfides.
Because the presence of negative values of the phonon frequencies
is typically indicative of a dynamic instability for a given material,46 it can be concluded that MS and M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) are dynamically stable. Under consideration
of the differences between ΔHf (M32S32) and ΔHf (M31S32), the absence of dynamic instabilities
for MS and M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) implies that
the tendency to form the metal-deficient sulfide is rather influenced
by subtle effects in the electronic (band) structures. An inspection
of the phonon densities-of-states for the zirconium-containing sulfides,
i.e., ZrS and Zr29S32 (Figure 2), shows that imaginary wavenumbers are evident
for both sulfides, which, accordingly, should be dynamically unstable.
Note that the phonon frequencies in ZrS correspond to more negative
values than those in the zirconium-deficient Zr29S32. This outcome suggests that the incorporation of zirconium
vacancies may alleviate the dynamic instability. In this context,
it is also remarkable that the experimentally determined phase width
of the zirconium sulfide spans a more metal-deficient existence range
relative to the remaining sulfides (see above).

in gray) correspond to imaginary modes, which typically point to a
dynamically unfavorable situation for a given material.

To examine the influence of vacancies on the dynamic stabilities
of zirconium sulfides in more detail, the vibrational properties were
also investigated for Zr3S4, which has been
reported43 to crystallize with a superstructure
of the NaCl-type sulfide and is zirconium-poorer relative to the other
zirconium sulfides. An examination of the phonon DOS for Zr3S4 (Figure 3) shows that the phonon frequencies in Zr3S4 indeed correspond to less negative values than those in ZrS and
Zr29S32. Accordingly, it may be inferred that
the presence of vacancies in the crystal structures of the zirconium
sulfides alleviates this dynamic instability. The existence of negative
values in the phonon DOS of Zr3S4 still indicates
that this material should be dynamically unstable. This result raises
the question of whether this dynamic instability could also be reduced
through adopting a different, but closely related type of structure;48,49 yet, that prediction requires further explorations. To understand
the tendencies to form the metal-deficient sulfides at the atomic
level, we followed up with an analysis of the electronic band structures,
densities-of-states, and projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations
(pCOHP) for all sulfides.

Electronic Band Structures
and Densities of States
An examination of the densities-of-states
(DOS) curves for all sulfides
(Figures 4 and 5) shows that the states close to the Fermi levels
mostly originate from the M-d as well as S-p atomic orbitals (AOs).
More precisely, the M-d states primarily reside in the energy regions
around the Fermi levels, while the bands arising from the S-p AOs
are located in energy regions below those ranges, which stem from
the M-d states. Because a number of bands cross the Fermi level in
each sulfide, all of the inspected sulfides should be metals. In the
flat band/steep band scenario,7,8 one would expect that
these atomic orbitals contribute to flat bands as well as steep bands,
which cross the Fermi levels of these rock salt-type sulfide-superconductors.
Yet, an inspection of the electronic band structures shows that flat
bands, which intersect the Γ-point in the electronic band structures
of MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr), are positioned close to, but not at the Fermi
levels in the respective sulfides. Notably, a maximum, which crosses
the W-point in the electronic band structure of ZrS, is also located
close to, but not at the Fermi level. In the case of LuS, a flat band
crosses the Fermi level at the Γ-point. As pointed out by previous
research,19 the absence of flat bands at
the Fermi levels in MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr) may lead to a discrepancy between
the observed metal-to-superconductor-transitions and an anticipated
flat band/steep band scenario. Previous research16 on the electronic band structures of chalcogenide superconductors
existing over certain homogeneity ranges, however, demonstrated that
the electronic structures and, furthermore, positions of flat bands
relative to the Fermi levels are influenced by the presence of vacancies
in the crystal structures of the chalcogenides. Indeed, an inspection
of the electronic band structures for the metal-deficient M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr29S32 indicates
that flat bands cross the Fermi levels in these sulfides. Furthermore,
an examination of the DOS curves for M31S32 (M
= Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr29S32 shows that the Fermi
levels fall at peaks of the DOS. In this connection, it should also
be noted that the presence of flat bands at the Fermi level in a given
material is typically related to electronic instabilities (see Introduction) such that the electronic situations
encountered for M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr29S32 should be less favorable than those observed
for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu). Why, then, should the former sulfides
be formed?

To answer this question,
we followed up with a chemical bonding
analysis for these sulfides. In this context, we also examined the
prospect of M–M bonding interactions because the locations
of the occupied M-d states at the Fermi levels may also imply that
these orbitals interact via M–M bonds.

Bonding Analysis
A (chemical) bonding analysis for
all sulfides was accomplished based on the projected crystal orbital
Hamilton populations (pCOHP) and their respective integrated values
(Figures 4 and 5). In the framework of the pCOHP approach that is
a variant of the COHP technique, the bonding information is gained
from the plane-wave-based computations (see Computational
Details).

An examination of the −pCOHP curves
for all sulfides reveals that the transition-metal–sulfide
interactions near the Fermi levels stem essentially from contributions
of the M-d and S-p atomic orbitals. The heteroatomic M–S interactions
change from bonding to antibonding states below the Fermi levels in
all sulfides and, hence, are of an antibonding nature at the Fermi
levels. The antibonding M–S interactions are “counterbalanced”
by bonding M–M interactions. The latter homoatomic interactions
arise mainly from the M-d bands located around the Fermi levels. An
integration of the heteroatomic M–S and homoatomic M–M
interactions indicates net bonding characters for these interactions
(see Table 2). Yet,
how can these interactions affect the presence of vacancies and, furthermore,
the chemical compositions of these sulfides?

To answer this question, we followed
up with a closer examination
of the −IpCOHP values for the sulfides. A direct comparison
between the −IpCOHP values of compounds with dissimilar compositions
cannot be made because the average electrostatic potential in each
density functional theory-based computation is set to an arbitrary
“zero” energy, whose relative position may vary from
system to system.9,50 In the lack of a true reference
energy, the cumulative −IpCOHP/cell values, i.e., the sums
of all negative IpCOHP/bond values for one particular type of nearest
neighbor, interatomic interaction within one unit cell, were projected
as percentages of the respective net bonding capabilities, a procedure
that has been largely described elsewhere.36,51

A comparison of the negative integrated pCOHP values (−IpCOHP)
for all inspected sulfides demonstrates that the −IpCOHP values
of the heteroatomic M-d–S 3p interactions are larger than those
related to the homoatomic M-d–M-d separations (Table 2). Because of such broad differences
between the −IpCOHP values, the M-d–S 3p interactions
have much larger percentage contributions to the net bonding capabilities
than the homoatomic M-d–M-d interactions in all sulfides. Accordingly,
this outcome suggests that the majority of the bonding interactions
occurs between the M–S contacts beside minor, but evident M–M
bonding, a circumstance that has also been encountered for certain
reduced (divalent) rare-earth-metal halides52 and transition-metal oxides.53 A comparison
between the percentage contributions of the rock salt-type sulfides
and the corresponding metal-deficient species reveals that the percentages
of the M-d–S 3p interactions are larger in the metal-deficient
sulfides than in the respective (parental) non-metal-deficient sulfides.
This result indicates that the occupations of antibonding M-d–S
3p states at the Fermi level in a given sulfide are reduced as the
number of vacancies in the crystal structure of the respective sulfide
increases. Notably, such a tendency has also been observed by previous
research on the interdependence between the electronic structures
of phase change materials and the presence of vacancies in their crystal
structures.54

At this point, one
may expect that the formations of the metal-deficient
species are favored because of the aforementioned depletion of destabilizing,
antibonding M–S states, which correspond to the largest percentages
to the net bonding capabilities. Indeed, that conclusion is in accordance
with previous55 research, which implied
that the presence of metal vacancies corresponds to an increase of
metal cation–chalcogenide anion orbital mixing and, eventually,
the stabilization of an entire defect (transition-metal chalcogenide)
crystal structure. Yet, why do the nonmetal-deficient transition-metal
sulfides exist? Actually, the differences between the percentage contributions
of the M–S interactions in MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) and those
in the respective metal-deficient sulfides are rather small such that
the latter rather tend to be preferred. Furthermore, electronically
unfavorable situations have been identified for all metal-deficient
sulfides because occupied flat bands are located at the Fermi levels
in M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr29S32 (see above). Thus, it may be inferred that the interplay
between the occupations of flat bands at the Fermi level, which typically
signify electronic instabilities, and the populations of antibonding
M-d–S 3p states appears to control the presence of vacancies
in the crystal structures of these sulfides.

Conclusions
In the light of (computational) materials design, there is a need
to understand the origins of vacancies in the crystal structures of
compounds existing over certain homogeneity ranges because the electronic
structure and, ultimately, the physical properties of such a material
depend on the particular composition. In this connection, the origins
of structural defects have been explored for the examples of rock
salt-type sulfide-superconductors, i.e., MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu), by
means of quantum-chemical techniques. Because the aforementioned sulfides
have been reported to exist over certain homogeneity ranges, the vibrational
properties, electronic band structures, and nature of bonding were
examined for MS (M = Sc, Y, Zr, Lu) as well as M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) and Zr29S32. The crystal
structures of the latter sulfides were derived from those of the former
sulfides, but comprise fewer metal atoms than the rock salt-type sulfides
in accordance with the experimentally determined crystal structures
and phase widths.

An examination of the vibrational properties
revealed that MS and
M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu) are dynamically stable
such that the formation of a given metal-deficient sulfide appears
to be controlled by effects in the electronic (band) structures. In
the case of the zirconium-containing sulfides, an inspection of the
phonon densities-of-states showed that the presence of vacancies apparently
alleviates a dynamic instability for that sulfide; yet, the negative
values of the phonon frequencies indicate that all of the inspected
zirconium sulfides should be dynamically unstable. In the electronic
band structures of LuS, M31S32 (M = Sc, Y, Lu),
and Zr29S32, the Fermi levels are crossed by
flat bands, which are in good agreement with a flat band/steep band
scenario expected for superconductors. Because the populations of
flat bands at the Fermi level in a given material are indicative of
an electronically unfavorable situation, the nature of bonding was
examined for all sulfides to explain the trends for the formation
of the metal-deficient sulfides.

A bonding analysis based on
the −pCOHP approach demonstrated
that the bonding situations in all sulfides are dominated by strong
M-d–S 3p bonding interactions, besides minor, but evident,
M-d–M-d interactions. The M-d–S 3p interactions are
antibonding around the Fermi levels, and the occupations of these
antibonding states are reduced as the metal contents of the sulfides
decrease. Accordingly, it may be concluded that the subtle interplay
between the populations of flat bands and antibonding M-d–S
3p states at the Fermi levels appears to control the presence of vacancies
in the crystal structures of the sulfides.
