Near-infrared (NIR)-response photocatalysts
are desired to make
use of 44% NIR solar irradiation. A flower-like α-MnO2/N-doped graphene (NG) hybrid catalyst was synthesized and characterized
by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The flower-like material of
α-MnO2/NG was oval-shaped with the semi major axis
of 140 nm and semi minor axis of 95 nm and the petal thickness of
3.5–8.0 nm. The indirect band gap was measured to be 1.16 eV,
which is very close to 0.909 eV estimated by the first-principles
calculation. The band gap can harvest NIR irradiation to 1069 nm.
The coupling of α-MnO2 with NG sheets to form α-MnO2/NG can significantly extend the spectrum response up to 1722
nm, improving dramatically the photocatalytic activity. The experimental
results displayed that the α-MnO2/NG hybrid catalyst
can recognize ammonia in methyl orange (MO)–ammonia, rhodamine
B (RHB)–ammonia, and humic acid–ammonia mixed solutions
and selectively degrade ammonia. The degradation ratio of ammonia
reached over 93.0% upon NIR light irradiation in the mixed solutions,
while those of MO, RHB, and humic acid were only 9.7, 9.4, and 15.7%,
respectively. The products formed during the photocatalytic process
were followed with ion chromatography, gas chromatography, and electrochemistry.
The formed nitrogen gas has been identified during the photocatalytic
process. A valence band recognition model was suggested based on the
selective degradation of ammonia via α-MnO2/NG.

1 Introduction
Near-infrared
(NIR) light (44%) and visible light (48%) account
for 92% of solar irradiation spectrum. Therefore, it is urgently desired
to develop NIR-response photocatalysts to make full use of solar spectrum.
Efforts have been paid to find out NIR-response photocatalysts, in
which up-conversion materials composed of rare earths,1−6 carbon quantum dots,7−10 and plasmon composites composed of Au and Ag6,11−13 have been synthesized. The efforts inspired scientists
to develop novel NIR-response photocatalysts for thorough usefulness
of solar irradiation.

It is known that α-MnO2 is a semiconductor material
with various band gaps with the size of particles or sheet thickness.
The band gap depends on the size and structure of this material. The
bulk MnO2 materials are usually regarded as indirect semiconductors
with very small band-gap energies of about 0.20–0.37 eV,14,15 while an ultralong nanowire α-MnO2 with the length
of more than 10 mm and width of 30 nm produced a band gap of 0.98
eV.16 One of α-MnO2 nanofibers
with typical diameters of 20–60 nm and lengths of 1–6
μm formed a band gap of 1.32 eV;17 another ultrathin MnO2 of nanosheets with the thickness
of about 0.5 nm achieved a band gap of about 2.23 eV.18 The shift of band gap to higher energies is attributed
to the carrier confinement in small semiconductor particles.16 Obviously, the band gap of α-MnO2 can been tailored by the size of the material to fulfill the goal
of wide spectrum absorption and full use of solar irradiation.

In addition, the surface modification such as copper phosphide
decorated on g-C3N4 nanosheets,19 Ag on Bi4Ti3O12 and CuBi2O4, improved markedly the photocatalytic activity.20,21 CdSe decorated N-doped TiO2 to boom the generation of
H2.22 N-doped graphene (NG)
can enhance the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts because
of the absorption of incident light, fast electron transportation
from semiconductors to NG, and the reduced recombination of the photogenerated
electron–hole pairs23,24 when it was coupled
with semiconductors. Therefore, the as-coupled product, α-MnO2/NG, was expected to be more active to NIR irradiation.

Selective photocatalysis is a very interesting research from organic
synthesis to environmental applications.25−30 It can synthesize specific target organic molecules or degrade specific
target pollutants. These selective photocatalytic reactions are based
on the interaction forces such as van der Waals and coordination between
hosts and guests. However, the potential recognition based on the
valence band (Ev) level has not been reported.
Herein, we reported the NIR-driven selective degradation of ammonia
via the α-MnO2/NG nanophotocatalyst, and a valence
band recognition model was achieved. It is expected to highlight NIR
photocatalysis.

2 Experimental and Calculations
2.1 Chemicals
Potassium permanganate
(KMnO4) was purchased from Shanghai General Chemical Reagent
Plant, and manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Graphite powder (average particle size = 30 μm) was purchased
from Shanghai Colloid Chemical Plant, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
was purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Factory. Ammonium sulfate
((NH4)2SO4), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), rhodamine B (RHB), and methyl orange (MO) were obtained
from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were of analytical
grade and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared
with 18.2 MΩ·cm deionized Milli-Q water.

2.2 Synthesis of NG
NG sheets were prepared
via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction of graphene oxide (GO) with urea
at 170 °C for 12 h.31 GO was obtained
by a modified Hummers method as we reported previously.32,33 The general procedures are as follows. First, natural graphite powders
were oxidized with concentrated KMnO4 in the presence of
H2SO4; then, the excess of KMnO4 was
reduced with H2O2 and exfoliated by sonication.
After GO was obtained, nitrogen insertion into graphene frameworks
using urea was achieved by a facile hydrothermal reaction at 170 °C
for 12 h. The nitrogen content could be controlled by the mass ratio
of GO to urea. A typical mass ratio (GO/urea) used in our case was
1:300 to obtain an optimal nitrogen content. Eighty milligrams (80
mg) of GO was dispersed into 80 mL of water with sonication, and then
24.0 g of urea was introduced in the 80 mL suspension solution for
continuing sonication for 2 h. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 100 mL, sealed, and heated
to 170 °C for 12 h to form NG (nitrogen content: ca. 7%).31 Finally, the resulting product was filtered,
washed, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum chamber.

2.3 Synthesis of α-MnO2/NG
The α-MnO2/NG catalyst with a loading of 1.0 wt
% NG was synthesized as follows. First, 6 mg of NG was dispersed into
20 mL of water with sonication, and 0.2672 g (1.35 mmol) of MnCl2·4H2O was added into the suspension solution
under sonication for 6 h. Then, the suspension solution was transferred
into a 50 mL three-necked flask, and then it was heated to 85 °C
under magnetic stirring. Finally, 0.1422 g (0.9 mmol) of KMnO4 was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water, and the KMnO4 solution was titrated into a three-necked flask at 85 °C
under continuous stirring. This temperature was maintained for 12
h to form α-MnO2/NG. After that, it was cooled to
room temperature, and the precipitates were collected, washed at least
for three times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum chamber for 8
h. The resulting product was denoted as α-MnO2/NG.
Similarly, α-MnO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and
pure α-MnO2 samples were synthesized for comparison.
The reaction formula was denoted as follows: 1  

2.4 Structure
Characterization and Mechanism Investigation
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray
diffractometer (D/Max 2500 PC). The X-ray source was Cu Kα radiation
with a wavelength of 0.154 nm, a tube voltage of 40 kV, and a tube
current of 40 mA. α-MnO2/NG and α-MnO2/rGO powders were dispersed in water using an ultrasonic device,
placed on carbon-coated copper grids, and dried under ambient conditions
for morphological observations using a transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) system (Tecnai G220, FEI, USA). UV–vis–NIR diffuse
reflectance spectra (UV–vis–NIR DRS) were recorded on
a Shimadzu UV–vis–NIR spectrometer (UV-3600 plus, Japan),
and the wavelength scope is 190–3400 nm. An X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (ESCALAB 50 XI) was utilized to characterize ammonia
adsorbed on α-MnO2 samples and chemical surrounding
of Mn in α-MnO2 samples before and after ammonia
was adsorbed to elucidate the molecular recognition mechanism. The
binding energy (Eb) scale was calibrated
with respect to the carbon 1s peak at 284.60 eV. The aluminum Kα
1.2 line (hν 1486.60 eV) was used as the X-ray
excitation source, and each powder sample was dispersed on a gold-plated
copper surface. The spectra were recorded in a fixed analyzer transmission
mode to achieve maximum instrumental resolution. The instrument was
operated under a vacuum of 1 × 10–9 Torr in
the analysis chamber. Wide and high-resolution spectra were recorded
at a constant pass energy of 50 eV and channel widths of 1.0 and 0.1
eV. The α-MnO2 samples were collected before and
after adsorbing ammonia to detect the Eb of N and Mn atoms on the catalyst.

Cyclic voltammetry was
performed using a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument
Company, TX, USA). The electrochemical experiments were conducted
in a conventional three-electrode system. A ring-disk platinum electrode
was used as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter
electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode.
In order to obtain the stable cyclic voltammograms of oxygen dissolved,
the working electrode was scanned between 0.0 and −1.4 V for
10 cycles before the measurement. The voltammetric measurements were
carried out in a sealed container to prevent O2 from air.

A Dionex (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) model ICS-900 ion chromatograph
was used for separation and detection of nitrite and nitrate. The
analytical column was Dionex IonPac AS14A (250 mm × 4 mm, i.d.),
and the guard column was IonPac AG14A (50 mm × 4 mm, i.d.). The
eluent was a mixture of 4.5 mmol/L sodium carbonate and 0.8 mmol/L
sodium bicarbonate, the eluent flow rate was set at 1.2 mL/min, the
column temperature was 25 °C, and the injection volume was 2
mL. A conductivity detector CD produced by the company Dionex (USA)
and conductivity suppressor ASRS-300 4 mm (Dionex, USA) were used
for the detection of anions.

In order to investigate the mechanism
of photocatalysis, a sealed
photocatalytic reaction system (Labsolar 6A photocatalytic system,
Perfect light Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) was used, in which a 100 mL
aqueous solution containing 100.0 mg/L NH3–N was
irradiated under NIR light and a 465 mL gas with an initial ratio
of oxygen to argon at 1:3 was cycled and the initial internal pressure
was maintained at 26 kPa. The sealed system was vacuumed before the
mixed gas of oxygen and argon was injected. The reaction system was
matched with a GC-7806 gas chromatograph (Shiwei Puxin Instruments
Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). The chromatographic column of 5 m length
× 2 mm i.d., filled with 5 Å molecular sieve, was utilized
as a separating column. High-purity argon was utilized as the carrier
gas. The flow rate of the carrier gas was set at 23 mL/min, and the
thermal conductivity tank was used to detect N2 and O2. The column temperature was set at 80 °C, the inlet
temperature at 120 °C, and the detector temperature at 150 °C.

2.5 Selective Degradation of Ammonia
Photocatalytic
experiments for degradation of ammonia were conducted
under NIR light irradiation (λ > 780 nm). A 300 W UV–visible
lamp (OSRAM, Germany) was used as the light source. Briefly, 50 mL
of ammonia solution was subjected to photocatalytic degradation in
a 100 mL beaker at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). The distance
between the lamp and the test solution was approximately 10 cm. The
wall of the beaker was protected from the surrounding light with an
aluminum foil. NIR light was obtained with a cutoff filter of λ
> 780 nm (see the picture of the cutoff filter in Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information). The filter
covered the
window of the beaker to absorb UV–vis light and allow NIR light
of λ > 780 nm to pass through. Typically, 50 mL of test solutions
was used in the degradation experiments. A specific concentration
of ammonia–organic compound solution was prepared according
to the desired concentration. Briefly, 0.10 g of the catalysts was
used for photocatalysis. NaHCO3–Na2CO3 buffer was used to control the pH of the solutions tested.

A double-beam TU-1901 spectrophotometer was used to determine the
ammonia concentration by using the Nessler reagent during photocatalysis.
The Nessler reagent [alkaline solution of dipotassium tetraiodomercurate(II)]
was prepared according to the following procedures. Briefly, 10 g
of HgI2 and 7 g of KI were dissolved in water, NaOH solution
(16 g of NaOH in 50 mL of water) was added to the mixture, and the
mixture was diluted to 100 mL by adding deionized water. The Nessler
reagent was stored in a dark bottle and diluted properly before analysis.
Ammonia reacts with the Nessler reagent to obtain colored solutions
by the reaction given in the following. The absorbance at 392 nm approached
the peak and was recorded at the wavelength of 392 nm. The decline
of the peak indicated the degradation of ammonia during the photocatalytic
process. 2  

The products degraded were identified
by ion chromatography, gas
chromatography, electrochemistry, and UV–vis spectroscopy during
the photocatalytic process (see Figures S5–S7 in the Supporting Information).

2.6 First-Principles
Calculation
The
calculations of band structure and density of states (DOS) were performed
by using the CASTEP package of Material Studio 7.0. In the plane-wave
calculations, a cutoff energy of 340 eV was applied. The generalized
gradient approximation was adopted with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional. The calculations were performed in a ferromagnetic spin-polarized
configuration. The self-consistent field convergence criterion and
energy tolerance were set as fine levels. A Monkhorst–Pack
scheme with a 1 × 1 × 5 k-point grid was
employed. The Taylor series method was used for dispersion-corrected
density functional theory correction. The α-MnO2 phase
is of a tetragonal structure with the space group 14/m (no. 87) and the lattice parameters a = 9.7980, c = 2.8513 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°,
in which the Mn and O atoms occupy the fractional coordinates of Mn
(0.35, 0.17, 0.00), O1 (0.16, 0.205, 0.00), and O2 (0.16, 0.458, 0.00).
These accurate data validated the applicability of the CASTEP package
for calculating the α-MnO2 structures.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 XRD Characterization
The as-synthesized
samples were determined by XRD spectroscopy, and the resulting patterns
are shown in Figure 1A. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 12.8°,
18.0°, 28.8°, 37.4°, 50.0°, 56.4°, 60.2°,
65.0°, and 69.7°, which are indexed to a pure tetragonal
phase of α-MnO2 (JCPDS, no. 41-0141) with I4/m space group and lattice constants a = 9.7980 and c = 2.8513 Å, corresponding
to the Bragg reflections of (110), (220), (310), (211), (301), (411),
(600), (521), (002), and (541) planes, respectively.34−37 There are one-dimensional 2 × 2 (4.6 Å × 4.6 Å)
and 1 × 1 (1.9 Å × 1.9 Å) tunnels intergrowth
along the c axis in the lattice shown in Figure 1B.37−40 No characteristic peaks are observed
for the impurities, indicating high purity and crystallinity of the
as-synthesized samples. In addition, the diffraction peak at 26.31°
was indexed to the plane (102) of rGO and NG, indicating that rGO
and NG were formed during the hydrothermal process. As aforementioned,
the 2 × 2 tunnels constructed of octahedral [MnO6]
have a 4.6 Å × 4.6 Å space, which enables to accommodate
cations. The tunnel structure makes it attractive to be used as photocatalysts
because the photocatalytic process is a redox one involving electron
transfer and associated cation shift to maintain the electrical neutrality
equilibrium.

tunnels. The purple balls denote Mn atoms and red balls O atoms.

3.2 Raman
Spectrum Characterization
To
investigate the vibrational properties of the as-synthesized samples,
the characterization of Raman spectroscopy has been conducted. Figure 2 presents the Raman
spectra of α-MnO2/NG (a), α-MnO2/rGO (b) composite, and α-MnO2 (c), rGO (d), and
NG (e) components. The vibration peaks at 646 cm–1 were assigned to the Ag mode originating from breathing vibrations
of the MnO6 octahedra, indicating the α-MnO2 crystallite.41 This observation is in
well-agreement with the XRD results. The G band at 1580 cm–1 in the rGO sample is characteristic of sp2-hybridized
C–C bonds in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, and the band
shifted to 1600 cm–1 after nitrogen atoms were doped
in the lattice as shown in the α-MnO2/NG (a) and
NG (e) samples. The D band located at 1335 cm–1 corresponds
to the defects and disordered carbon in the graphitic layers.42 In addition, the broader 2D peaks appeared at
around 2645 and 2905 cm–1, which is consistent with
that of the few-layer NG reported by Yu.43

3.3 TEM Observation
Figure 3A,B shows the representative
TEM images of the obtained α-MnO2/NG samples. Dispersive
nanoflowers can be observed throughout the samples. Most of the flowers
are oval-shaped with the semi major axis of 140 nm and semi minor
axis of 95 nm, as shown in Figure 3B. The thickness of prevailing petals is among 3.5–8.0
nm, and this nanostructure favors to adsorb the randomly approaching
molecules to decline the surface tension. High-resolution TEM image
(Figure 3C) indicates
the polycrystalline feature of α-MnO2 in the as-synthesized
α-MnO2/NG sample. A finger distance of 0.50 nm corresponds
to the d-spacing value of the plane (200) in α-MnO2,44 which is in agreement with
the above XRD analysis. The other finger distance adjacent to α-MnO2 was found to be 0.34 nm in Figure 3C, which is the same as the d-spacing value of the plane (002) in pure NG sheets in Figure 3D. It also shows the compact
alignment between α-MnO2 and NG.

samples: (A,B) α-MnO2/NG; (C) high-resolution TEM
image; and (D) pure NG.

3.4 XPS) Characterization
XPS measurements
of the as-synthesized α-MnO2/NG samples have been
carried out to further confirm the structure and composition. The
as-measured results are presented in Figure 4. The total survey revealed the presence
of Mn, O, and N atoms in the as-synthesized α-MnO2/NG sample, as shown in Figure 4A. High-resolution XPS pattern indicated two peaks
of 642.27 and 654.07 eV (Figure 4B), which are attributed to the binding energy of Mn
2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively. The spin energy
separation of 11.80 eV is in very good accordance with the reported
datum on MnO2, confirming the presence of α-MnO2,40,45 which is also consistent with the XRD result
as reported previously. The XPS spectrum of O 1s binding energy is
shown in Figure 4C,
and the two peaks centered at 530.1 and 531.29 eV corresponded to
Mn–O–Mn and Mn–O–H, respectively, in the
α-MnO2/NG composite. The presence of Mn–O–H
indicates that oxygen atoms linked to some of Mn atoms in the MnO6 octahedra may interact with hydrogen atoms via a hydrogen
bond or a covalent coordination bond because water and related hydrides
(H3O+) can also be accommodated in the tunnels.40,46 Three different types of nitrogen configurations (Figure 4D), including pyridinic N (397.13
eV), pyrrolic N (399.75 eV), and quaternary N (graphitic N, 401.68
eV) revealed that nitrogen atoms were bonded in the graphene framework.47

and α-MnO2 (b); and (D) N 1s XPS spectra in α-MnO2/NG.

3.5 UV–Visible–NIR
Reflection Spectra
Figure 5 shows the
UV–visible–NIR reflection spectra of the as-synthesized
α-MnO2 (a), α-MnO2/rGO (b), and
α-MnO2/NG (c) species. From the spectra, the absorption
peaks were observed at 380 nm in the UV region, and an absorption
band for the pure α-MnO2 species was observed in
the visible and NIR region as shown in curve (a). The absorption peak
in the NIR region is assigned to the electron transition derived from
the mixing of metal d–d and oxo-to-metal charge transfer,48−52 which is also confirmed by our calculation using the CASTEP method
below. On the basis of the UV–visible–NIR reflection
spectra, the direct and indirect optical band gaps of the as-synthesized
α-MnO2 (a), α-MnO2/rGO (b), and
α-MnO2/NG (c) species can be determined by Tauc’s
relation 3  where A is the constant, hν is the photon energy,
and α is the absorption
coefficient, while n = 2 for direct and n = 1/2 for indirect transition. It has been known that α-MnO2 is an indirect semiconductor.46 Thereby, the indirect band-gap values are given, as shown in Figure 6, which are equal
to 1.16, 1.00, and 0.72 eV for α-MnO2, α-MnO2/rGO, and α-MnO2/NG, respectively. The indirect
band gap for pure α-MnO2 is 1.16 eV, which is very
close to 0.98 eV reported in the literature.16 The transition corresponds to the NIR wavelength of 1069 nm, which
provides a profound basis for using NIR irradiation as power for photocatalytic
applications. The band gap is further reduced to 0.72 eV after it
was combined with NG as shown in curve (c) in Figure 6, implying that the α-MnO2/NG species can absorb more NIR irradiation as a photocatalyst for
a more effective photocatalysis. As predicted, the combination of
rGO with α-MnO2 led to a narrow indirect band gap,
which is equal to 1.00 eV. These facts prove the strong interaction
between α-MnO2 and NG or rGO.

3.6 Band
Structure and DOS
The band structure
(Figure 7A) and total
DOS and partial DOS (PDOS) of α-MnO2 (Figure 7B) were calculated by the first-principles
method, resulting in an indirect band gap of 0.909 eV, which is close
to 1.160 eV determined by our experimental measurements, which is
also in very good agreement with that calculated previously.16,46,53 As seen from Figure 7B, the total DOS are provided
by s, p, and d orbitals. Obviously, 3d orbitals in Mn atoms (Figure 7C) were split into
the low energetic level of t2g and high energetic level
of eg in the MnO6 octahedral field46,48−52 and contributed to the valence band and conduction band (Ec), together with p orbitals provided by O atoms
(Figure 7D). This band
structure of α-MnO2 favors the absorption of incident
NIR irradiation.

levels at each k-point, respectively. Total DOS and

a vertical dashed line.

3.7 Selective Degradation
As seen in
Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, the α-MnO2/NG catalyst can degrade ammonia under
NIR light irradiation, and Figure S3 shows 3.0% of the NG content
reaching the maximum degradation ratio (Figure S3). Given the coexistence of ammonia together with organic
pollutant in practical waters, RHB and MO were chosen as organic model
pollutants to examine the selectivity of the α-MnO2/NG catalyst. The results indicated that the degradation ratio of
ammonia reached over 93.0% under NIR light irradiation in NH3–MO mixed solution or NH3–RHB mixed one
as shown in Figure 8, while the ratios were only 9.7 and 9.4% for MO and RHB, respectively.
The degradation ratio of ammonia is much higher than that of MO or
RHB under the same conditions, indicating that the α-MnO2/NG photocatalyst can recognize and degrade ammonia selectively
from MO or RHB in their coexistence. Under the similar conditions,
humic acid was used to examine the selectivity of the α-MnO2/NG photocatalyst, and the results indicated that 15.7% of
humic acid was degraded for 7.0 h (Figure S4), while over 93.0% of ammonia was eliminated in 50.0 mg/L humic
acid and 50.0 mg/L NH3–N mixed solution. It confirmed
further the selectivity of the photocatalyst for ammonia.

Figure 8 Selective degradation
of ammonia in the presence of 50 mg/L NH3–N (a)
plus 50 mg/L MO (b) in 50 mL solution under
NIR light irradiation and in the presence of 50 mg/L NH3–N (c) plus 50 mg/L RHB (d) in 50 mL solution under NIR light
irradiation.

The subsequent investigations
indicated the adsorption of ammonia,
MO, and RHB on the catalyst; the adsorption ratios were 17.6 and 2.1%
for ammonia and MO, respectively, in NH3–MO mixed
solution in dark for 8 h and 17.1 and 3.1% for ammonia and RHB, respectively,
in NH3–RHB mixed solution (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Adsorption of NH3, MO, and RHB on
the α-MnO2/NG catalyst in 50 mL solutions in the
coexistence of 50 mg/L
NH3–N (a) plus 50 mg/L MO (b) and in the coexistence
of 50 mg/L NH3–N (c) plus 50 mg/L RHB (d) for 8
h in dark. The mass of the α-MnO2/NG catalyst was
0.10 g, and pHs were adjusted to 10.50 by adding 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3–Na2CO3 buffer.

XPS measurements showed the adsorption of NH3, MO, and
RHB molecules on the catalyst with the same shift of 0.2 eV at Mn
2p3/2 (Figure 10), implying a nonspecific adsorption. That is, the adsorption
is a physical one but not a chemical one. In other words, the selective
degradation of ammonia using α-MnO2/NG as the photocatalyst
in NH3–MO or NH3–RHB mixed solution
under NIR irradiation could be attributed to another reason.

for 8 h.

3.8 Insights
of Selectivity and Reaction Mechanism
As estimated by experiments,
the indirect band gap of α-MnO2/NG is 0.72 eV, which
corresponds to the energetic difference
between valance band and conduction band. Figure 11 presents the valence band XPS spectrum
of the α-MnO2 species. The top of valance band is
the highest binding energy of the filled electrons and is defined
as the intercept at 0.00 eV on the background. Therefore, the valence
band of α-MnO2/NG can be obtained as 1.44 eV based
on the XPS measurement because the valence band is mainly composed
of O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals as seen in Figure 7B. The conduction band can be estimated as
0.72 eV because the band gap is 0.72 eV.

Figure 11 Valence band measurement
of α-MnO2 by XPS spectrum.

As far as photocatalytic reactions are concerned, they involve
the oxidization process driven by photogenerated holes and the reduction
process driven by photogenerated electrons. In a viewpoint of electrochemistry,
the photogenerated holes can be regarded as oxidizing agents for the
oxidization process, while the photogenerated electrons can be regarded
as reducing agents for the reduction process. The photogenerated holes
could oxidize the species collided only when the holes on top of the
valence band are more positive than the redox potential of the species
collided (reducing agents). It has been known that the electrode potential
for E0(N2/NH3) is
equal to 0.057 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), whereas the
anodic peak potential is equal to about 1.18 V versus NHE for the
oxidization of RHB54,55 and 1.497 V versus NHE for the
oxidization of MO.56 Under consideration
of over-potentials, the oxidization of ammonia to dinitrogen is much
easier than that of MO or RHB to their oxidized states. Therefore,
the preference of the valence band of α-MnO2 resulted
in the selective oxidization of ammonia from MO or RHB in solutions.

For the reduction process, the photogenerated electrons could reduce
the species collided (oxidizing agents) only when the electrons excited
on the bottom of the conduction band are more negative than the reduced
potential of the species collided. The Fermi level for the perfect
graphene is just located at the so-called Dirac point. For the NG,
the Fermi level is shifted up into the conduction band, which is due
to the electron donation from the doped-nitrogen atom to the antibonding
π* band.57,58 Graphitic nitrogen atoms in NG
resulted in shifting up with the Fermi energy level of 0.66 V versus
NHE,59 that is, the conduction band level
of NG is 0.66 V versus NHE. The level (0.66 V) of conduction band
is much negative than that of 1.23 V versus NHE, which shows the potential
of oxygen being reduced to water. Therefore, oxygen can accept photoelectrons
from the conduction band of NG to form water. Furthermore, the band
gap of NG is in the range of 0.045–0.550
V, depending on the nitrogen-doped content from 0.5 to 8.0%.60 In the case here (ca. 7.0%), the band gap is
about 0.48 eV, so the valence band level of NG is 1.14 V. The valence
band level of NG could accept the photogenerated electrons transferred
from the conduction band of α-MnO2. The band structure
of NG was combined with that of α-MnO2, establishing
the Z-scheme photocatalytic system for the removal of ammonia.61,62 Therefore, the overall mechanism for selective oxidization of ammonia
can be presented in Figure 12. The product has been identified as N2 gas by
means of UV–vis spectroscopy, electrochemistry, ion chromatography,
and gas chromatography (see Figures S5–S7 in the Supporting Information). It is concluded that
the matched band structure of α-MnO2/NG oxidized
ammonia selectively.

the α-MnO2/NG catalyst.

4 Conclusions
The α-MnO2/NG hybrid catalyst is synthesized via
a one-pot method. The theoretic band gap (0.909 eV) based on the first-principles
calculation is very close to that (1.16 eV) measured by UV–vis–NIR
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, indicating that the theoretic simulation
approaches to the real band structure of α-MnO2.
The analysis based on first-principles calculation reveals that the
valence band is composed of hybrid O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals and that
the conduction band is composed of Mn 3d and O 2p orbitals. The band
structure of α-MnO2 results in the response to NIR
irradiation, which makes it as a NIR photocatalyst. The combination
of α-MnO2 with NG to form α-MnO2/NG significantly extends the spectrum response to 1722 nm. The results
show that α-MnO2/NG as a photocatalyst can make full
use of NIR irradiation. α-MnO2/NG can degrade ammonia
selectively in a mixed solution of ammonia and MO or RHB or humic
acid under NIR light irradiation to release nitrogen gas, which is
attributed to the matched band structure of α-MnO2/NG and the valence band level of α-MnO2.
