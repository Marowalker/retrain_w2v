It
is shown here that controlled mixing of a gelator, drug, solvent,
and antisolvent in a microfluidic channel leads to faster setting
gels and more robust materials with longer release profiles than the
physical gels of the same composition obtained using random mixing
in solution. The system is similar to a related gelator system we
had studied previously, but we were unable to apply the same gelling
procedure because of the instability of the colloid caused by the
small structural modification (length of the alkyl chain in the bis-imidazolium
head group). This situation holds true for the gels formed with varying
compositions and under different conditions (gelator/drug ratio, solvent
proportion, and flow rates), with the most significant differences
being the improved gel rheology and slower drug release rates. Very
importantly, the gels (based on a previously unexplored system) have
a higher water content ratio (water/EtOH 4:1) than others in the family,
making their medicinal application more attractive. The gels were
characterized by a variety of microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction
and infrared spectroscopy, and rheology. Salts of the antiinflammatory
drugs ibuprofen and indomethacin were successfully incorporated into
the gels. The diffraction experiments indicate that these composite
gels with relatively short alkyl chains in the gelator component contrast
to previous systems, in that they exhibit structural order and the
presence of crystalline areas of the drug molecule implying partial
phase separation (even though these drug crystallites are not discernible
by microscopy). Furthermore, the release study with the gel incorporating
ibuprofenate showed promising results that indicate a possible drug
delivery vehicle application for this and related systems.

Introduction
The control of nanostructure
in soft matter systems is important
in a number of areas,1−4 among them in the preparation of materials for controlled drug delivery.5−9 Gels can be chemical (comprising a covalent network) or physical
(or supramolecular, comprising noncovalent bonds).10−13 Polymeric chemical gels comprise
covalently bonded networks of fibers that cannot be redissolved, and
the structures are thermally irreversible, which make them limited
where relatively rapid degradation is preferred. Hence, physical (macro)molecular
gels, where noncovalent interactions lead to gelation and are generally
characterized by their structural reversibility under thermal and
mechanical stress, could be a better choice for drug delivery applications.14,15 Supramolecular gels can be formed at low temperature, with the majority
of the solvent component trapped between the entangled and intertwined
nanofibrous networks that are often held together by London dispersion
forces between the alkyl chains of the gelator.

Gemini-imidazolium
amphiphiles are one such kind of supramolecular
material16 existing as colloids17−19 and that can form gels20 useful for drug
delivery, where the cationic nature of the head group provides a location
for interaction with drug molecules.21,22 Previously,
we have explored the gelation ability in bulk of gemini-imidazolium
amphiphiles related to compounds 1–3 (Figure 1),21,22 comprising two imidazolium rings linked through a bis-methylenebenzene
spacer (either 1,3- or 1,4-substituted) and bearing n-octadecyl chains. These gels were stable and capable of incorporating
anionic drugs as drug delivery systems mainly targeting topical applications.
However, in the course of our studies on related compounds bearing
shorter alkyl chains, we found that the bulk gel formation (usually
carried out in sample pots in our experiments) sometimes led to a
qualitatively inhomogeneous material and the gel formation—achieved
by mixing aqueous and ethanolic solutions—could be poorly reproducible.
For this reason, we sought a controlled mixing protocol that could
provide a reproducibly more homogeneous material. In doing so, some
intriguing effects of mixing on supramolecular composite gel formation
have been discovered.

Figure 1 Structures of the imidazolium-based gelators 1·2Br–3·2Br and the sodium salts of ibuprofen and indomethacin.

The mixing technique we used involved combining
distinct components
under laminar flow in a microfluidic chip, in which small volumes
of fluids are combined in a channel with micrometric dimensions—generally
from tens to hundreds of micrometers.23,24 Microfluidics
has a growing range of applications in various fields, from combinatorial
materials synthesis25,26 to biomedicine (drug delivery,
separation, and diagnostic devices).27−29 Among the many advantages
of the continuous preparation of materials using microfluidics30 are the parallel and consecutive reactions in
a single system, low reagent consumption, and the highly controlled
and steady mixing, which can be useful for the preparation of nanomaterials.31 The mixing in the chips is characterized by
a low Reynolds number, and therefore, the flow is laminar; mixing
of fluids occurs only at the interface through diffusion with the
viscous force dominant and no lateral convection. In narrow channels,
the surface area to volume ratio is high and the heat and mass transfer
rate increases compared with other conditions because of the steeper
temperature and concentration gradients.32,33 It has been demonstrated that the self-assembly of amphiphiles can
be controlled using a microfluidic system to determine the flow condition,31 but insomuch as we are aware, excepting the
fabrication of polymer microgels by gelation in droplet microfluidics,34 there is no such experiment on bulk gelling
systems.

The initial hypothesis for our study was that inside
the microchannel,
the dominant interfacial forces, enhanced heat—and mass diffusion—transfer,
can be exploited to promote the self-assembly process of the supramolecular
gelators with the drug molecule with different flow parameters to
obtain stable gels efficiently incorporating the drug. The basis for
this hypothesis is the observed influence of flow on the formation
of nanoscale aggregates in solution.35 Our
purpose is to show that microfluidic systems can be used as a platform
for supramolecular gel formation for materials for drug delivery applications.
Here, we demonstrate this proof of principle for the gelator molecules 1–3 when combined with the sodium salts of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs ibuprofen and indomethacin (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
The gelator molecules (prepared using methods described elsewhere21,36,37) that contain between 14 and
16 carbon atoms in their aliphatic chains were first explored as gelators
on their own for mixtures of ethanol in water. The putative gel mixtures
were prepared by adding water (that acts as an antisolvent here) to
the gelator dissolved in ethanol, swirling the mixture and leaving
it undisturbed at room temperature for some time, because gels do
not form immediately. Under these conditions, chaotic mixing takes
place, and it is not possible to control reproducibly the combination
of the two liquids. To obtain the optimum solvent mixture for gel
formation, gelation experiments with different concentrations of the
gelator and different proportions of ethanol and water were attempted.
For the gels with drug, different aqueous concentrations of the sodium
salt of either ibuprofen or indomethacin were mixed with the ethanolic
solution of the gelator. Some of the different conditions tested for
the gel formation incorporating these drugs are shown in Table 1 (see Table S1 in
the Supporting Information for more details).
Compound 1·2Br formed the qualitatively less homogeneous
(large fibers were observed in the only gel that formed) and less
stable gel and was not taken forward in the subsequent studies, whereas
both 2·2Br and 3·2Br formed more
homogeneous and stable gels. The time for the gels to set properly
was rather long (several hours to days, see Table 1), an aspect that is improved dramatically
by the subsequent microfluidic preparation routes (see below).

a Ibu—ibuprofen
(sodium salt);
Ind—indomethacin (sodium salt).

The ethanol/water ratio is the dominant factor determining
gel
formation, with the length of the alkyl chains playing a lesser, though
significant, role in gelation ability across the series studied here.
None of the gelators are able to immobilize a 1:1 volume mixture of
the solvents, whereas all of them gel in a 1:4 mixture of ethanol
and water at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The analogous gelator with
alkyl chains bearing 18 carbon atoms21 does
not form gels at this high water content at this concentration (the
maximum aqueous content is 2:3 ethanol/water), although it does gel
this mixture at a concentration of only 5 mg/mL. In the present study,
the higher ratio of water possible for the gel formation probably
arises from the fact that the amphiphiles with shorter chains are
less hydrophobic and thus more soluble in the medium. On the other
hand, the shorter chains tend to lead to thicker fibers, as seen visually
because of the much greater visible light scattering (see photographs
of a selection of the gels, Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Another striking difference between the gels
reported here and
the analogue with longer hydrocarbon chains is their ability to have
higher drug loadings while maintaining an apparently homogeneous phase.
Previously, only gels with a maximum molar ratio of 4:1 (gelator/ibuprofen
sodium salt) could be obtained.21 Instead,
for gelator 2·2Br, equimolar amounts of gelator
and ibuprofen (sodium salt) result in the formation of a gel in a
1:4 ethanol/water mixture. For the sodium salt of indomethacin in
combination with 2·2Br, the equimolar mixture does
not form a gel, whereas the 2:1 mixture does. The more favorable gel
formation in the presence of the drug molecules as a result of shortening
of the alkyl chain in the gelator (whereas the polar head group is
identical) is an interesting and potentially useful effect. The gels
prepared from compounds 2·2Br and 3·2Br take longer to form than their octadecyl homologue.21 Importantly, though, the higher content of the drug in
the gel achieved using these gelators compared with previous ones
represents a clear advantage regarding drug loading.

During
the preparation of these gels, occasionally, the reproducibility
of gel formation was not perfect, and it was clear that occasionally
inhomogeneous gels formed, sometimes with a nongelated solvent present.
To address this lack of reproducibility, we turned to microfluidic
mixing.

The microfluidic chips we employed comprised four symmetric
inlet
channels that converge and continue as a single channel, the microreactor,
as seen in Figure 2. They were obtained by the replica molding technique (soft lithography)
of a microfabricated mold using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS).26,27 An outlet solvent proportion 20:80 ethanol/water and a total gelator
concentration 10 mg/mL were used in all the microfluidic experiments.
Different flow conditions were tried to obtain a stable gel loaded
with drug. The flow rates for every experiment are specified for Inlet
1, Inlet 2, Inlet 3, and Inlet 4 in μL/min in Table 2.

inlets and outlet of the microfluidic setup
and the experimental configurations for the gelation experiments.

a Configuration 1:
Inlets 1 and 4
= water + drug, Inlets 2 and 3 = ethanol + gelator; configuration
2: Inlets 1 and 4 = water, Inlets 2 and 3 = ethanol + gelator + drug;
Ibu—ibuprofen (sodium salt); Ind—indomethacin (sodium
salt). Experiments gave a final water/ethanol ratio of 80:20, so the
final concentration of the gelator is 10 mg/mL.

Because ibuprofen sodium salt is
soluble in both ethanol and water,
two experimental configurations were used. In configuration 1, the
gelator was dissolved in ethanol and the drug in the water streams
(these conditions resemble the ones used in the bulk mixing gelation
experiments), whereas in configuration 2, both gelator and drug were
dissolved in ethanol. The inlet channels in the center (Inlets 2 and
3) were connected to the ethanol solution containing gelator or containing
gelator and drug, and the outer inlet channels (Inlets 1 and 4) were
connected to water with drug or water, respectively. A selection of
experimental conditions is shown in Table 2 (see the Supporting Information, Table S2, for more information on gelation outcome
and gelation time).

Visual comparison of the gels prepared in
bulk solution with those
obtained using microfluidic mixing indicated that the latter showed
better quality; no excess solvent was ever visible, the gels were
more homogeneous (to the naked eye), had better stability, and most
importantly showed better drug-loading capacity (up to a gelator/drug
ratio of 1:1 for 2.2Br). Additionally, the gelation process after
microfluidic mixing is faster when compared to the bulk gelation in
all cases (on the order of hours compared with days). This order of
magnitude increase in the speed of gelation is, for example, for the
2:1 2.2Br/indomethacin sample going from 120 h without microfluidic
mixing to only 2–3 h with microfluidic mixing. This effect
is presumably a result of the faster self-assembly arising from a
more homogeneously distributed material and nucleation sites in the
mixture emerging from the microfluidic channel. The nuclei grow homogeneously
in three dimensions to form an intertwined fibrous network with apparently
uniform distribution that cannot be achieved by simple mixing in bulk.
Without any drug, the gels of 2·2Br and 3·2Br were formed at flow rates of 160 μL/min in the outer inlets
(water) and 40 μL/min in the middle inlets (gelator in ethanol)
to maintain the preferred 4:1 solvent proportion. When preparing gels
incorporating drug with configuration 2 with a 2:1 gelator/drug molar
ratio, and at flow rates 160/40/40/160, 3·2Br formed
a gel with ibuprofen (sodium salt) only, whereas 2·2Br formed a gel with both ibuprofen (sodium salt) and indomethacin
(sodium salt). Increasing the molar ratio of drug to 1:1 did not result
in the formation of a gel with ibuprofen (sodium salt). Therefore,
different flow rates were tried, and it was found that 2·2Br did form a gel with ibuprofen (sodium salt) with a 1:1 molar ratio
using configuration 1 at a flow rate (80/20/20/80). Photographs of
the different outcomes obtained by changing the flow rates with a
1:1 molar ratio of 2·2Br and ibuprofen (sodium salt)
using either configuration 1 or 2 are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Photographs of the outcomes from the attempted
gel formation with
a 1:1 mixture of 2·2Br and ibuprofen (sodium salt)
configuration 1 at flow rates (A) 320:80:80:320, (B) 160:40:40:160,
(C) 80:20:20:80, and (D) 40:10:10:40 and configuration 2 (E) 160:40:40:160
and (F) 80:20:20:80.

Forming the gel with 2·2Br and ibuprofen
(sodium
salt) at 1:1 molar ratio, using configuration 1 and the initially
tested flow rates (160/40/40/160) and (320/80/80/320), resulted in
a turbid white suspension (Figure 3A,B). Lower flow rates were then attempted: gel formation
occurred at flow rates (80/20/20/80) (Figure 3C), and further reducing the flow rates to
half (40/10/10/40) resulted in the partial formation of a gel that
had poor mechanical stability (Figure 3D). This evidence suggests that the residence time
inside the microchannel plays a very important role in the evolution
of the self-assembly of the gelator in the presence of a drug molecule
to form a stable gel structure. The lack of stable gels at slower
flow rates is in no doubt partly caused by the formation of agglomerates
inside the channels. Although this solid gets dispersed in the solvent
before collecting from the outlet, a nonhomogeneous partial gel with
a high amount of solvent not trapped inside is formed because of the
changing concentration of the gelator in the effluent from the chip.
Using mixing configuration 2, no gel formation was observed. Instead,
turbid solutions with a small amount of deposits at the bottom were
obtained (Figure 3E,F).
This observation suggests that a homogeneous mixture of ibuprofen
(sodium salt) and gelator in the ethanolic solution does not favor
the formation of long fibers that lead to gelation (vide infra).

The samples from the experiments where no gel was formed under
different flow rates were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(to determine the size distribution of the particles present in the
suspension) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (to analyze the
deposits obtained in the outlet). DLS indicated that in all cases
the particles had diameters of around 1 μm (see Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information). The SEM images
(Figure 4) show that
the output from the higher flow rates (in configuration 1) contains
phase-separated deposits that have a very heterogeneous fibrous structure
with some particles that could come from the liquid phase while drying
(Figure 4A,B). The
SEM images of the partial gel that formed under lower flow rates (half
of the flow rates which formed a gel in configuration 1) show that
it comprises fibers with smaller width (when compared to the case
that formed a gel) and drug precipitate was also seen (Figure 4C). Whereas in configuration
2 with the same flow rates of configuration 1 which formed a gel,
also contains the nonhomogeneous morphology with fibers, particles
that could come from the liquid phase and crystals of drug due to
phase separation (Figure 4D).

Figure 4 SEM images of output mixtures obtained with the microfluidic system
of 2·2Br and ibuprofen (sodium salt) (1:1) from
experiments with configuration 1 (A) 320:80:80:320, (B) 160:40:40:160,
and (C) 80:20:20:80 and configuration 2 (D) 80:20:20:80. Images were
taken with 4000× magnification; the scale bar represents 20 μm
in all images.

Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and SEM were used to determine the
structural differences between the gels formed in bulk or microfluidic
mixing conditions (Figures 5 and 6). AFM in the intermittent (“tapping”)
mode of the xerogels of both 2·2Br and 3·2Br shows that the fibers of both colloids are not single fibers but
co-parallel bundles of narrower fibers that are joined laterally.
The gels formed by 2·2Br contain fibers that are
much wider than those formed by 3·2Br, under both
bulk and microfluidic mixing conditions. For gelator 2·2Br, the average width of the fibers is similar in both cases, approximately
450–650 nm, although the bulk gelation experiment tends to
produce fiber aggregates of lower order, whereas those from microfluidic
mixing can be several microns wide and composed of several individual
fibers, as seen clearly in the SEM images (Figure 5). For the gels formed by 3·2Br, a more pronounced effect is seen: in the bulk sample, the polydisperse
fibers have widths of around 50–250 nm, whereas from microfluidic
mixing, more uniform 200–300 nm wide fibers are generated.
Once again, a co-alignment of individual fibers to give tapes comprising
multiple joined fibers is observed under microfluidic mixing conditions.

images of gels of 2·2Br and 3·2Br from gelation in solution and microfluidic mixed systems. The scale
bar is 1 μm in all images.

Figure 6 SEM images of the gels obtained with both bulk (A–D) and
microfluidic mixing (E–H) obtained with 2·2Br (A,E), 2·2Br with ibuprofen (sodium salt) 1:1
molar ratio (B,F) and 2:1 molar ratio (C,G) and with indomethacin
(sodium salt) 2:1 molar ratio (D,H). Images were taken with 4000×
magnification; scale bars represent 20 μm.

Comparison of the morphology of the gels formed with drugs
presents
a trend (Figure 6)
similar to that of the pure gelators. The microfluidic mixing leads
to fibrous networks observed in the xerogels by SEM that have much
greater lateral interfiber connections, a feature especially prominent
for the samples incorporating drugs. All the gels are composed of
fibers irrespective of the presence and type of drug, but the morphology
and dimensions of the fibers differ in each case: the width of the
fibers of the gel without any drug is smaller when compared to that
of the gels with drugs both in bulk and microfluidics gelation. This
confirms the influence of drug in the assembly and consequently in
the morphology of the fibers. It should also be noted that the gels
of 2·2Br with drugs (both ibuprofen sodium salt
and indomethacin sodium salt) obtained with the microfluidic system
show much wider fiber bundles (from a mean value of approximately
150 nm to 1 to 2 μm, depending on the case, the visual appearance
of the gels also gives support to this observation). The fibers of
gels from 3·2Br are smaller, fused with each other
and with poorly defined edges (Supporting Information, Figure S4) when compared to gels from 2·2Br where
the fibers are relatively wider and more distinct.

The difference
in morphology of the gels is echoed in the mechanical
stability and viscoelastic properties of the materials. Rheological
studies of the gels of pure 2·2Br and 2·2Br containing ibuprofen sodium salt prepared under both bulk and microfluidic
mixing (configuration 1, flow in inlets 80:20:20:80) conditions show
important differences in the materials. The use of microfluidic mixing
increases both the resistance to deformation, as seen in the G′ and G″ values (storage
and loss modulus) (Figure 7), and the resistance to rupture, as seen in the critical
stress values (Table 3). In the case of the gel formed solely with 2·2Br (without drug), critical stress is increased up to 24% when using
a microfluidic mixing platform as compared to the bulk process.

Figure 7 Stress sweep
tests of pure 2·2Br gels (A,B) and
the same gelator with ibuprofen sodium salt (C,D) prepared by bulk
mixing (A,C) or microfluidics (B,D).

The mechanical properties of the
gel are also affected by the incorporation
of a drug. The gel incorporating ibuprofen sodium salt prepared by
the bulk process shows 82% less resistance to rupture when compared
to the gel without drug. However, using microfluidic mixing, the gels
with sodium ibuprofenate are more than twice resistant to rupture,
and four times more flexible, as seen in G′
values, when compared to the bulk process gel with ibuprofen sodium
salt (Figure 7). All
these data show that the supramolecular differences found in gels
as a result of using the microfluidic mixing significantly enhance
their mechanical and viscoelastic properties.

The surrounding
of the drug molecule in the gel formed with an
equimolar amount of 2·2Br and ibuprofen sodium salt
using the microfluidic system (at 80:20:20:80 flow ratios) was analyzed
by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
experiments. The IR spectra show, besides the peaks that correspond
to the gelator, the presence of a peak at 1714 cm–1 that corresponds to the carboxylate group of ibuprofen sodium salt
(Supporting Information, Figure S5), but
no shifts in the signals from either compound corresponding to the
possible host–guest inclusion were witnessed, implying that
any contact between the gelator and the drug must be at the interfaces
between the materials. The PXRD (Figure 8) study confirmed this hypothesis. The diffractograms
of the gel formed by 2·2Br with ibuprofen sodium
salt (1:1 molar ratio), from both bulk and microfluidic mixing experiments,
show a peak at about 3.5 in 2θ that corresponds to the crystalline
ibuprofen sodium salt,21 suggesting that
the drug crystallized in the gel without incorporating into the bulk
structure of the gel fibers. However, as presented above, drug crystals
are not visible in the images obtained by SEM (or by optical microscopy),
and thus, a layered structure must be present in the fibers with areas
of gelator and drug, presumably held together by electrostatic interactions
at the interfaces between the materials. Interestingly, the peak that
corresponds to ibuprofen sodium salt is more intense in the gel from
microfluidics (Figure 8B), which suggests that the fiber growth occurs along this crystallographic
direction of the drug. The gelator has similar relative intensities
in diffraction peaks, which suggests that the fiber growth is favored
under both bulk and microfluidic mixing conditions.

Figure 8 Powder X-ray diffractograms
of xerogels formed with 2·2Br, without drug and
with ibuprofen sodium (1:1 molar ratio) prepared
(A) in bulk solution and (B) using microfluidic at a flow rate ratio
of 80:20:20:80 in configuration 1.

These results concerning long-range order in the gels contrast
with the ones seen with gels prepared using the analogous gelator
containing 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, where no drug crystallinity
could be observed by PXRD (albeit it at a lower drug loading).21 Although the higher drug loading used in these
gels may contribute to this factor, the morphology of the drug is
clearly modified and the crystalline areas are indistinguishable from
those of the gelator.

The ability of the drug-loaded gels to
release the incorporated
compound was studied in materials with the highest ibuprofen sodium
salt content. Both, the gel prepared with mixing in the microfluidic
platform (flow rate ratio of 80:20:20:80 in configuration 1) and the
gel obtained with bulk preparation, were studied for comparison purposes.
The release was performed in vitro using a Franz-cell system, with
a receptor phase with pH 7.4 all maintained at 37 °C to simulate
human physiological conditions. The amount of the released drug was
calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the drug present
in the gel. Three different kinetic models that can describe the drug
release from hydrogels (first-order release, Peppas–Korsmeyer
and Higuchi) were used to fit the experimental data obtained. The
Akaike information criterion (AIC) was calculated to determine which
model presents the best adjustment (see the Supporting Information, Table S3). The release profiles for the two gels
are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Drug release profiles, at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, of ibuprofen sodium
salts from the gels of 2·2Br obtained by microfluidics
and bulk gelation processes.

The most important difference found between the gels is the
release
kinetics. The gel prepared in bulk follows first-order release kinetics,
whereas that obtained with the microfluidic system follows a Higuchi
model, which resembles a first-order model during the first hours,
but does not reach a plateau, suggesting that the drug could keep
releasing with time. Regarding the speed of the drug release, the
bulk prepared gel shows a faster release, with a constant KD of 0.017 h–1. The maximum
amount of ibuprofen salt that can be released is around 55%, and after
40 h, half of this value is already reached. The gel prepared using
microfluidics, on the other hand, shows a slower release profile.
The KD is 3.08 h–1,
and after 48 h only 20% of the total drug is released. The release
of 50% of the total amount of drug would take around 260 h. Even though
the initial release seems faster, afterward, it slows down. The release
is constant, but the amount being released is very small and the time
interval is very wide.

All these differences found in the drug
release profiles between
microfluidics and bulk prepared gels could be explained by the morphological
and rheological differences between them. With regard to the previous
studies with gelators with a similar structure, but with longer alkyl
chains, it was found that more than 75% of ibuprofen salt was released
under similar conditions, although loading of the drug was much lower
(gelator/drug ratio 4:1).21 In the present
case, the bulk gel can release up to 50%. It is sure that these gels
are able to load a much higher amount of the drug (gelator/drug ratio
1:1) when compared to the previously described ones, which means that
the amount of the drug released per weight of the composite is approximately
five times higher. Furthermore, the effect of microfluidic mixing
produces a different release profile to bulk mixing and therefore
is a useful tool to employ in the preparation of gel-derived release
systems.

Conclusions
The gels described here show the dramatic
effect that the chain
length of the gelator can have on the incorporation of guest drug
compounds and their morphology and consequently on their release characteristics.
These effects are true for samples prepared in bulk solution mixing
conditions as well as using a microfluidic system to mix the two solution
components of the far-from-equilibrium system. In microfluidic mixing
conditions, the flow rates and residence time inside the microchannel
greatly influence the gel formation. We show an order of magnitude
increase in the speed of gelation in certain cases, for example, the
2:1 gelator/indomethacin sample gels in 120 h without microfluidic
mixing and only 2–3 h with microfluidic mixing. The effect
of diffusive mixing taking place at the early stages of assembly—as
is the case for liposome systems38—is
propagated into the formation of the gel, even in the presence of
drugs that are incorporated. These effects may be of interest for
the preparation of other composite materials, such as gel–nanoparticle
materials,39 and for the use of this kind
of mixing in additive manufacturing applications of soft materials.40 The gels formed under microfluidic mixing here
were found to be more stable, consistent, and with better drug incorporation
than the gels from bulk gelation, and the combination of gels for
vehicles and microfluidics for mixing are promising variables in the
search for materials for drug delivery.

Experimental Section
General
Methods
The SEM images of the xerogels were
acquired by the electron microscopy service in the ICMAB-CSIC on a
Quanta FEI 200 FEG-ESEM system. The dry gels on the carbon tape were
coated with gold before imaging to avoid the charging of the samples.
All the images were taken at 15 kV, with a spot size of 3–4
and a working distance of ≈ 10 mm under high vacuum conditions.
AFM images were recorded by the scanning probe microscopy service
at ICMAB-CSIC on a PicoSPM system (molecular imaging). The intermittent
contact mode was used close to resonance frequencies of the silicon
cantilevers (nanosensors, FM type force constant 1.2–3.5 N/m
and tip diameter 5 nm) of around 60–70 kHz. All the images
were recorded under atmospheric conditions.

The IR spectra of
dry gels were obtained with spectrometer PerkinElmer Spectrum One
FT-IR, energy range: 450–4000 cm–1 using
the universal attenuated total reflectance accessory (U-ATR).

XRD measurements were performed with a Siemens D-5000 X-ray diffractometer.
The source was a DRX ceramic tube (λ Cu Kα = 1.540560
Å and λ Cu Kα 2 = 1.544390 Å) with a voltage
and current of 45 kV and 35 mA, respectively. The gel was mounted
on a glass slide and dried and was scanned from 2θ = 2.5 to
2θ = 75°.

DLS was performed using Zetasizer Nano
ZS, Malvern Instruments
for the samples from microfluidics which formed turbid solution at
room temperature. Only the solution was taken in the cuvette.

The rheological characterization was performed at 32 °C using
a HAAKE RheoStress 1 rheometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Karlsruhe,
Germany) connected to a Thermo Haake Phoenix II + Haake C25P temperature
controller. The rheological studies were carried out on freshly prepared
samples in the native state. The oscillatory test was conducted with
a plate–plate setup (Haake PP60 Ti, 60 mm diameter, 1 mm gap
between plates), by performing oscillatory stress sweeps between 0.1
and 100 Pa at 1 Hz, to determine the resistance to deformation, related
to storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″), and the phase shift (δ). Both the viscoelastic
moduli are defined as follows: G′ = τ0/γ0 cos δ and G″
= τ0/γ0 sin δ (where τ0 and γ0 are the amplitudes of stress and
strain).

Microfabrication of Microfluidic Chips
The microchannels
were formed by transferring the complementary structure of a silicon
master (fabricated by the standard photolithography of SU-8 epoxy
resist on the silicon substrate) to PDMS and bonding the latter to
glass. The length, width, and height of the microreactor in the chip
are 10 mm, 250 μm, and 50 μm, respectively. Fabrication
of the PDMS chips was carried out in the Nanoquim platform class 10000
(ISO7) clean room facility (ICMAB-CSIC scientific and technical services)
under controlled room conditions (T = 21 °C,
ΔP = 20 mbar and RH ≤ 45%). PDMS (20
g) and curing agent (1.8 g) were taken and mixed well. The mixture
was degassed with vacuum for 30 min. Then the mixture was poured without
any bubbles onto a mold which was placed on the silicon master containing
the structure (complementary structure of microchannels). It was then
cured in an oven at 150 °C for 10 min. PDMS got solidified, and
holes were made at the ends of the inlet and outlet channels for the
external connection. The surface of PDMS which contains the structure
(channels) and a side of a glass slide were exposed to nitrogen plasma
for 1 min and 30 s. PDMS was placed on the glass slide (with the sides
exposed to plasma), pressed well, and kept on a hot plate at 75 °C
overnight for the bonding to occur.

Bulk Gelation
For all bulk gelation experiments without
any drug, the gelator was dissolved in ethanol, and water was added
(v/v ratio depends on the experiment, see Table 1) and mixed well. For the gel with ibuprofen
(sodium salt), the drug was dissolved in water and added to the ethanolic
solution of the gelator and mixed well. For the gels with indomethacin
(sodium salt), both gelator and drug were dissolved in ethanol and
water was added to the solution and mixed well by stirring by hand.
All the experiments were done at room temperature and were kept undisturbed
after mixing until the formation of gels.

Mixing Using a Microfluidic
System for Gelation
Experiments
using the microfluidic chips described above were carried out by taking
the solutions in the syringe (volume and concentration depend on the
need of the experiment) that were connected to the holes of the inlet
channels of the PDMS chip through a tube of 1 mm diameter. The flow
rates (see Table 2)
were controlled by neMESYS low-pressure syringe pumps, Cetoni Automation
and Microsystems GmbH, Germany. The output of the experiments was
collected with a small outlet tube (1 mm in diameter) connected to
the hole in the outlet channel. The neMESYS user interface software
was used to control the syringe pumps.

Drug Release Experiments
For the release study, two
gels were chosen: the gel obtained using the microfluidic system (configuration
1 flow rate ratios 80:20:20:80), and the corresponding gel obtained
in bulk conditions with an ethanol/water proportion of 20:80 and a
gelator/drug molar ratio of 1:1. The release of the drugs from the
gels was performed in a Microette transdermal diffusion system (Microette
plus-Hanson Research) with vertically assembled Franz-type diffusion
cells (crown glass). Dialysis membranes (Cellu Sep T3 dialysis membrane,
MWCO 12 000–14 000 Da, MFPI, USA), previously
hydrated in water/methanol 1:1, were placed in the Franz-type diffusion
cells. Known weights of gel were placed into the donor compartment
onto the dialysis membranes. The dialysis membrane and the donor container
were put onto the glass receptor chamber, and the assembly was fixed
with a joint. The receptor chamber contained phosphate-buffered saline
100 mM pH 7.4, which complies with the SINK conditions. The Franz-type
cells were connected to a controlled temperature system, with a heating
bath set to 37 °C. Samples were taken at given time intervals,
and the sample taken was replaced by an equal volume of the receptor
solution.

Drug determination in samples was done by high-performance
liquid chromatography in a Waters LC module I, in a Waters Spherisorb
5 μm ODS-2 (4.6 mm × 150 mm) column. The mobile phase consisted
of acetonitrile/water (acidified to pH 3 with phosphoric acid) 65:35,
with a flow rate of 1.5 mL min–1, and the detection
wavelength was set to 220 nm. The data were collected using Millennium32
version 4.0.0 software from Waters Corp. All data were calculated
as the average ± standard deviation of three replicates. A nonlinear
least-squares regression was performed using the WinNonLin software
(WinNonlin Professional edition version 3.3, Pharsight Corp., USA),
and the model parameters were calculated. Modelistic parameters were
statistically compared by using Statgraphics software version 5.1.
