Water purification technologies possibly
based on eco-sustainable,
low cost, and multifunctional materials are being intensively pursued
to resolve the current water scarcity and pollution. In this scenario,
polysulfone hollow porous granules (PS-HPGs) prepared from scraps
of the industrial production of polysulfone hollow fiber membranes
were recently introduced as adsorbents and filtration materials for
water and air treatment. Here, we report the functionalization of
PS-HPGs with polydopamine (PD) nanoparticles for the preparation of
a new versatile and efficient adsorbent material, namely, PSPD-HPGs.
The in situ growth of PD under mild alkaline oxidative polymerization
allowed us to stably graft PD on polysulfone granules. Enhanced removal
efficiency of ofloxacin, an antibiotic drug, with an improvement up
to 70% with respect to the pristine PS-HPGs, and removal of Zn(II)
and Ni(II) were also observed after PD modification. Remarkably, removal
of Cu(II) ions with an efficiency up to 80% was observed for PSPD-HPGs,
whereas no adsorption was found for the PD-free precursor. Collectively,
these data show that modification with a biocompatible polymer such
as PD provides a simple and valuable tool to enlarge the field of
application of polysulfone hollow granules for water remediation from
both organic and metal cation contaminants.

Introduction
The development of
advanced technologies for efficient water remediation
is a matter of great current concern. Indeed, given the decreasing
availability of fresh water all over the world and the increasing
sources of water contamination, solutions for the simultaneous removal
of different classes of pollutants, possibly based on environmentally
sustainable and low-cost approaches are urgently required.1 Adsorption on porous materials is one of the
most simple and versatile strategies for water treatment;2−4 it is based on the chemi- or physisorption of adsorbate molecules
on the adsorbent surface through cooperative intermolecular surface
interactions that depend on the adsorbate and adsorbent nature. Activated
carbons are the most commonly used adsorbent for the removal of organic
microcontaminants,5 including those of
emerging concern.6 However, despite their
wide application range and low cost, they still suffer from expensive
regeneration costs (both from energetic and environmental points of
view) and loss of performance after regeneration.7 Materials alternative or complementary to activated carbons,
including natural or plastic industrial wastes and nanomaterials,
have been proposed.8−14 In this scenario, our group recently introduced a new porous granular
material, namely, polysulfone hollow porous granules (PS-HPGs, Figure 1), that allowed simultaneous
adsorption of organic contaminants from water and gas phase and filtration
of aerosol nano/microparticles.15 Interestingly,
PS-HPGs were prepared by using scraps of polysulfone hollow fiber
membranes derived from the production of commercial ultrafiltration
modules. The industrial process employed for cartridge preparation
leads to the production of scraps with an average amount of about
5–10% in weight of the total year production. We demonstrated
that such scraps can be converted into a granular material (PS-HPGs)
that preserves almost unchanged porosity and morphology (Figure 1b, right) of the
starting hollow fibers but shows higher adsorption capability due
to the higher surface area. Efficient removal of selected volatile
organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and emerging
organic contaminants was demonstrated for PS-HPGs. In addition, filtration
of aerosol particles was observed in dynamic experiments on in situ-generated
NaCl nanoparticles. Although filtration is enabled by the intrinsic
porosity of the starting polysulfone membranes (Figure 1b, right), adsorption capability is related
to the chemical structure of polysulfone and high surface area, allowing
interactions with hydrophobic organic contaminants through secondary
interactions. Aiming at the tailoring of the surface chemo–physical
properties and at the consequent extension of the PS-HPG application
range, we introduce here a polydopamine (PD; Figure 1a) nanoparticle-modified version of PS-HPGs,
namely, PSPD-HPGs, which was prepared by in situ growth of polydopamine
on polysulfone granule scaffolds. Polydopamine (PD) is a bioinspired
melanin-like material that, because of its stability, biocompatibility,
and easy deposition on many types of inorganic and organic substrates
(ceramics, metals, oxides, synthetic, and natural polymers),16−18 has recently attracted much attention in several fields, such as
medicine, energy, sensing, and water purification.19−22 The polydopamine structure includes
catechol, amine, and imine functional groups (see Figure 1a).

Zambianchi”, copyright 2016) and the structure observed by
SEM analysis (right).15

In particular, catechol groups are crucial for
the PD adhesion,
which forms strong hydrogen bonds with the substrates onto which it
is placed. Indeed, stable surface modification of filtration membranes
with PD has been widely investigated to increase their hydrophilicity
and, consequently, to improve their resistance to fouling during water
filtration.22 In addition, the catechol
groups and nitrogen heteroatoms are expected to be the active sites
for heavy-metal ions, synthetic dyes, and other organic pollutants
through electrostatic, bidentate chelating, or hydrogen-bonding interactions.
In this respect, it has been recently demonstrated that PD coating
increased the adsorption capacity of substrates on which it is deposited
both in terms of organic contaminants and metal ions. For example,
it has been demonstrated that the PD deposition on polysulfone membranes
increased the removal of a representative positively charged contaminant
as methylene blue (MB) with increasing PD coating time.23 The increased removal of heavy metals and metal
cations (i.e., Cd(II) and Pb(II)) upon PD functionalization of graphene
hydrogel was also reported.24 A similar
behavior was also observed for PD-functionalized zeolite that showed
an adsorption capacity toward Cu(II) at pH = 5.5, about 40% higher
than that of the pristine material.25 On
this basis, we envisioned the possibility of enhancing the adsorption
versatility and efficiency of PS-HPGs by PD nanoparticle (NP) coating.
Here, we demonstrated that in situ PD NPs adhere stably to PS-HPGs,
affording a robust material able to remove both organic contaminants
and metal ions from water. To test the absorption properties of PSPD-HPGs,
we selected three different emerging organic contaminants (EOCs),
suspected endocrine disruptors,26−28 such as Rhodamine B (RhB), a
pink organic dye widely used in the textile industry, ofloxacin (OFLOX),
an antibiotic found in influent waters and in sludge,29 and benzophenone-4 (BP4), a bio-recalcitrant molecule widely
used in sunscreen and found even in surface waters.30 RhB was also chosen as a model organic micropollutant and
is being already proven to be efficiently removed by PS-HPGs.31 Moreover, three bivalent metal cations such
as Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) were also considered. Indeed, heavy
metals generally derived from industrial wastewaters are also a matter
of concern for their toxic effects on human health (high blood pressure,
sleep disabilities, irritability, increased allergic reactions, etc.)
that have been extensively investigated.32−34

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
PS-HPGs coated with
PD (PSPD-HPGs) were prepared by exploiting the oxidative polymerization
of dopamine in alkaline aqueous solution (Figure 2a) (see Experimental Section). The color change of the PS-HPG material is the primary indicator
of catechol oxidation and subsequent dopamine polymerization. Indeed,
PS-HPGs (Figure 1b,
left panel) appear white, whereas the PSPD-HPG-coated material displays
a dark brownish color, which indicates the PD surface deposition (Figure 2b, right panel).
After PD polymerization, the obtained PSPD-HPG material was collected,
and before use, it was washed in flowing water, dried, and then rewashed
with water to eliminate all the non-adsorbed PD (see Experimental Section). As indicated in Figure S1, the release of PD was completed after 4 h of washing,
indicating that after this time, the material is ready to be used
for absorption experiments without secondary contamination risks.
The size and the surface charge of the NP-coating layer were characterized
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential (Pz) measurements
on reference PD NPs prepared under the same experimental conditions
(non-adsorbed). PD NPs showed a hydrodynamic diameter of 123.3 ±
4.4 nm and a Pz of −30.6 ± 1.4 mV. Finally, the amount
of PD coating, calculated by elemental analysis (PS-HPGs: N = 0%;
C = 52%; H = 2%; S = 6.2%; PSPD-HPGs: N = 0.58%; C = 70.40%; H = 4.81%;
S = 7.20%), resulted in a weight percentage of PD in the PSPD-HPGs
of around 6.1 wt %.

The morphology of the PSPD-HPG-coated
material was investigated
by SEM analysis. As showed in Figure 3, in comparison to uncoated PS-HPGs,15 the PSPD-HPG material showed a very porous structure with
the presence of a PD coating made of small particles with a mean diameter
of about 130 nm in agreement with the DLS study (Figure 3c,d). The surface wettability
of the PS-HPG and PSPD-HPG substrates was investigated by using contact
angle measurements. Because the powders are not suitable for this
type of measurements, the same coating conditions were extended to
PS membranes (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

pores. (c) Detail of the pore channels coated with PD nanoparticles.

Figure 4a,b
shows
the images of water droplets onto PS and PSPD membranes, respectively.
The PS substrate shows a contact angle value of about 93° (92.8
± 2.7), whereas the PD-coated PS substrate displays a lower value
of about 57° (57.4 ± 4.6), suggesting an increased wettability/hydrophilicity
of the polysulfone after PD functionalization/coating. Pictures of
the polysulfone granules dispersed in water are also reported (Figure 4c) to give an idea
of the increased hydrophilicity of the PSPD-HPG material in comparison
to uncoated PS-HPGs.

Massimo Zambianchi”, copyright 2016).

The structure of PS-HPGs after PD coating was investigated
by ATR
measurements. Figure 5 shows the ATR spectra of pristine PS-HPGs in comparison with PSPD-HPG-coated
material. The spectra of PS-HPGs (black line) and PSPD-HPGs (red line)
are very similar; however, the appearance of a broad background in
the spectral region of C–C, C=C, and N–H vibrations
in the PSPD-HPGs occurs, indicating the presence of a PD coating.19,35

(red line), and PD (blue line) in the (a) 800–1800 cm–1 and (b) 1800–4000 cm–1 regions.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used
to study the surface
chemistry of PSPD-HPGs, in relation with pristine polymers PD and
PS-HPGs. The probe depth of XPS used in the experimental setup was
about 3 nm. The stoichiometric ratios are reported in Table 1, and the S 2p and N 1s spectra
are shown in Figure 6. The PS-HPG spectrum was in excellent agreement with previously
published data; particularly, the binding energy of S 2p3/2 was 168.0 ± 0.1 eV (see Figure 6), corresponding to the R2–SO2 group
of PS,36 and the stoichiometry ratios of
O/C and S/C in Table 1 have confirmed the chemical structure in Figure 1a. The PD powder has the expected stoichiometry
for O/C and N/C ratios; moreover, the N 1s peak (400.2 ± 0.1
eV) was associated to the amine group (R–NH–R)37 present in the PD chemical structure in Figure 1a. The N 1s and the
S 2p signals were univocally associated with the PD and PS-HPGs, respectively;
thus, in the first approximation, it was possible to quantify the
amount of PD coating on the PSPD-HPGs, which presents both of these
XPS peaks (Figure 6), as the ratio between the area of N 1s peak over the sum of the
areas of N 1s and S 2p peaks. The S 2p peak in PSPD-HPGs was 10 times
less intense than that in the pristine PS-HPGs (S/C goes from 0.04
± 0.01 in PS-HPGs to 0.004 ± 0.001 in PSPD-HPGs); thus,
the obtained PD coverage was significantly high (96 ± 2%). No
chemical shift was observed in the S 2p and N 1s of the PSPD-HPGs
with respect to the pristine polymers. Resuming, the ATR elemental
analysis and XPS confirmed that the homogeneous nanoparticle coating
observed by SEM analysis is made of PD.

Adsorption
Experiments
EDC Adsorption Test
The adsorption
experiments were
performed in batch at three different contact times (15 min, 1 h,
and 24 h) (Figure 7) using an adsorbate initial concentration of 5 mg/L of each compound
and an adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L. After 15 min treatment, PSPD-HPGs
work more efficiently than PS-HPGs for OFLOX, whereas BP4 and RhB
were more efficiently captured by PS-HPGs. The same trend was observed
at a treatment time of 1 h with a slight increase in the removal efficiency
of PSPD-HPGs (52% → 59% for OFLOX and 50% → 66% for
RhB). However, upon increasing the treatment time to 24 h (Figure 7), the OFLOX removal
efficiency of PSPD-HPGs was even superior than that of PS-HPGs (81%
vs 47%), whereas the RhB removal was the similar to that of PS-HPGs
(99% vs 99%). BP4 was poorly removed by both materials with similar
performances (9% vs 10%). These data suggest a slower kinetics for
PSPD-HPGs but an almost competitive or even better performance in
the case of OFLOX once equilibrium is reached. OFLOX and BP4 have
similar molecular weight, solubility, and log Kow (Table S1, Supporting Information). However, only for OFLOX, a 1.7-fold increase in removal (corresponding
to 72% improvement) was observed for PSPD-HPGs with respect to PS-HPGs.
No improvement after PD coating was found for BP4 (removal of <10%).
The removal improvement in the case of OFLOX together with the lack
of effect for BP4 could be thus related to the strongly different
dipole moments of the two molecules (Table S1 and Figure S3, Supporting Information). Indeed, OFLOX with
a dipole moment of 13.0 debye is removed better than BP4, for which
a lower value up to 5.9 debye is reported. In turn, the PS-HPG functionalization
with PD increases the presence of polar groups on the surface, thereby
enhancing the dipole–dipole interactions that can promote the
adsorption of the more polar OFLOX compared to BP4. In agreement,
a similar behavior was observed for polysulfone–graphene oxide
(PS-GO) composite with respect to GO-free counterparts, in which the
higher hydrophilicity of GO increases the interactions with polar
compounds.31

of EDCs by PS-HPGs and PSPD-HPGs at different
treatment times: (a) 15 min, (b) 1 h, and (c) 24 h. The adsorption
experiments were performed in batch using 50 mg of PSPD-HPGs in 25
mL of EDC solution (5 mg/L of each compound).

Metal Cations
The pH of the solution has an important
effect on the adsorption process as it influences the structure of
the adsorbent and the metal ion speciation in solution. The studies
on the effects of pH were carried out in the pH range of 2.0–6.0,
according to the stability of each metal ion. Figure 8a shows the metal ion removal efficiency
of PSPD-HPGs as a function of solution pH. From Figure 8a, an increase in the metal ions adsorbed
has been observed with the increasing pH. In particular, the amount
of metal ions adsorbed increased until pH 4.0 for Cu(II) and until
pH 6.0 for Zn(II) and Ni(II). In acidic solutions (pH values lower
than 3.0), the protonation of chemical functional groups on PSPD-HPGs
resulted in a positively charged surface; as a consequence, the adsorption
capacities of metal ions were low due to the electrostatic repulsion.
With increasing pH values, the surface charges of PSPD-HPGs became
more negative, and the adsorption capacities of Zn(II), Ni(II), and
Cu(II) increased in the range of pH values from 3.0 to 6.0. For pH
= 5, the adsorption ability of Cu(II) was decreased probably due to
the formation of metal hydroxide adducts resulting in reduced activity
of metal ions in solution; for pH > 6, the precipitation of Cu(OH)2 colloidal particles increases, and the data are not comparable
with those obtained at lower pH.38 The
optimum pH for the adsorption of Zn(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) was then
recorded at pH 6.0, 6.0, and 4.0, respectively. As shown in Figure 8b, under these pH
conditions, the metal ion uptake of uncoated PS-HPGs was very low;
in particular, it was negligible for Cu(II), indicating that, in this
case, the uptake can be ascribed only to the PD deposited on the polymer.
Because the best performances of PSPD-HPGs were observed for copper
ions (almost 90% of removal efficiency), we focused our work on this
type of metal ion. The Cu(II) adsorption isotherm of PSPD-HPGs was
then obtained at the optimum adsorption pH, equilibrating, at room
temperature and for 24 h, the sorbent (2 g/L) with copper solutions
having concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 mg/L. To analyze the phenomenon
of metal ion release from the PSPD-HPGs_Cu, release tests were obtained
by contacting the PSPD-HPGs_Cu with aqueous solution and HCl solution.
Thus, we analyzed the supernatant after the filtration of PSPD-HPGs_Cu
immersed in acidic and aqueous media. The copper release in an acidic
environment was almost complete, whereas that in bidistilled water
was around 1.7%, demonstrating that the PSPD-HPGs_Cu complex is stable
in water, and at the same time, the sorbent can be regenerated after
acidic treatment.

Nonlinear Fitting of the
Isotherm Models
The mechanism
of adsorption of PSPD-HPGs was studied through adsorption isotherms
and compared with that of starting PS-HPGs. Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Dubinin–Radushkevich adsorption isotherms for RhB, OFLOX,
and Cu(II), respectively, are shown in Figure 9, whereas the corresponding correlation coefficients,
isotherm parameters, and related standard deviations are reported
in Table 2. For the
PS-HPG sample, only the experimental data related to the adsorption
of OFLOX and RhB were considered, because that sample showed nonsignificant
adsorption toward Cu(II) cations. OFLOX is a neutral polar and hydrophilic
molecule (log Kow = −0.4), and
RhB is a zwitterion (physicochemical properties shown in Table S1, Supporting Information). The adsorption
of RhB from both PS-HPGs and PSPD-HPGs is very high, whereas OFLOX
is better adsorbed by PSPD-HPGs than PS-HPGs. For all these reasons,
we considered them for the mechanism insight. Langmuir isotherm is
an empirical model, which assumes that the adsorption is a monolayer
adsorption occurring at a finite number of localized sites.39 The expression of Langmuir isotherm model is
illustrated by the following equation 1  where Ce (mg/L) is the concentration of the adsorbate at equilibrium, qe (mg/g) is the corresponding adsorption capacity,
and qm (mg/g) and KL (L/mg) are related to the adsorption capacity and net enthalpy
of adsorption, respectively. Freundlich adsorption describes the non-ideal
and reversible adsorption, which can be applied to multilayer adsorption,
on the basis of an assumption concerning the energetic surface heterogeneity.40 The nonlinear equation of the Freundlich isotherm
model is illustrated by the equation 2  where KF and n are the constants that measure the
adsorption capacity and surface heterogeneity, respectively. In particular,
the smaller 1/n, the greater the expected heterogeneity.
If n lies between 1 and 10, this indicates a favorable
sorption process. The Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R)41 isotherm is another empirical model generally
applied to describe the adsorption process onto both homogeneous and
heterogeneous surfaces. The linear expression of the D-R model is
described by eqs 3 and 4 3   4  where qs (mol/g) is related to the adsorption capacity, KD (mol2/kJ2) is a constant
related
to the mean free energy of adsorption R (J/mol·K),
which is the gas constant, and T (K) is the absolute
temperature. The mean free energy E (kJ/mol) can
be calculated by using the following equation: 5  The E value
gives information about the adsorption mechanism: if the magnitude
of E is between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, the adsorption process
is of chemical type, whereas when E < 8 kJ/mol,
the adsorption process proceeds physically.42 As a concern to the OFLOX adsorption on PSPD-HPGs, the highest R2 value and the lowest standard deviations were
derived by fitting the experimental data with the Langmuir isotherm
model, thereby suggesting a monolayer adsorption where the estimated
maximum adsorption capacity is 66 mg/g. The E value
obtained from the fitting with the D-R model falls between 8 and 16
kJ/mol, indicating an adsorption mechanism of chemical type (i.e.,
through van der Waals and H-bond interactions). The functionalization
of polysulfone with dopamine modifies the adsorption behavior of the
material toward OFLOX. Indeed, the OFLOX adsorption on PS-HPGs is
better fitted by the Freundlich model, indicating a multilayer adsorption
on a heterogeneous surface. Moreover, the energy of adsorption calculated
by the D-R model is 8, indicating predominant physical interactions
between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. Meanwhile, the fitting of
the experimental data related to the adsorption of RhB on PSPD-HPGs
results in a higher R2 value and lower
standard deviations for the Freundlich model, compared to the Langmuir
model, indicating a multilayer adsorption of RhB onto the adsorbent
surface. Moreover, the n value lies between 1 and
10, indicating a favorable adsorption. Also, in this case, the mean
free energy of adsorption falls between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, indicating
a chemical-type adsorption (likely an interplay of π–π
stacking and electrostatic interactions). Moreover, the obtained E value is higher for RhB than OFLOX, suggesting stronger
chemical interactions of the adsorbent with RhB than those occurring
with OFLOX. Also, the RhB adsorption on PS-HPGs is a favorable adsorption,
which follows the Freundlich model (n < 10); however,
the KF value calculated for the PSPD-HPG
adsorbent is about four times higher than that of PS-HPGs, demonstrating
that the functionalization of PS with PD increases the adsorption
performances of the material toward the RhB. The best fitting for
the Cu(II) adsorption is given by the Langmuir isotherm model, and
the calculated theoretical value for the maximum adsorption capacity
is 4.8 mg/g. In this case, the mean free energy calculated through
the D-R model is 8 kJ/mol, suggesting a physical-type adsorption of
copper ions onto the adsorbent surface.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated that polysulfone granules prepared
by using industrial scraps of polysulfone hollow fiber membranes (PS-HPGs)
can be efficiently coated with PD nanoparticles to provide an eco-sustainable
and low-cost material to be used as adsorbents for drinking water
treatment. Simultaneous adsorption of organic and metal ions contaminants
from water was indeed achieved only after PD functionalization with
removal capabilities of PSPD-HPGs toward OFLOX, RhB, and Cu(II) consistently
enhanced compared to that of uncoated PS-HPGs. Synergic chemical and
physical adsorption mechanisms of removal of the targeted contaminants
were allowed by PD functionalization; indeed, physical adsorption
mechanism was evidenced by the D-R model for Cu(II) adsorption only
for PSPD-HPGs. Notably, the porosity of the PS hollow granule derived
from the industrial polysulfone hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes
is retained after chemical modification, suggesting the possibility
to exploit PSPD-HPGs for combined adsorption and filtration purposes.
Studies in this direction are currently underway.

Experimental
Section
PSPD-HPG Synthesis
The PD coating on PS-HPGs was performed
by exploiting the oxidative polymerization of dopamine in aqueous
solution.43 Specifically, 5 g of polysulfone
granules was added to 0.01 M dopamine hydrochloride aqueous solution.
A solution of 1 N NaOH (molar ratio of dopamine hydrochloride to NaOH,
1:1) was added to the dopamine hydrochloride solution at room temperature
under vigorous stirring. The white granules rapidly turned pale yellow
and then gradually changed to dark brown. The polymerization was carried
out for 24 h (shorter polymerization times such as 5 h lead to unstable
coating and significant NP release), and after aging, the PSPD-HPGs
were recovered by filtration and washed in a flowing water (1 L of
deionized water for 1 g of the PSPD-HPG material) for 1 h. The obtained
PSPD-HPG material was then dried at 50 °C until a constant weight
and rewashed with water before use for 5 h to remove all the unabsorbed
PD (see Figure S1, Supporting Information).

Characterization
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen contents
were determined by elemental analysis using an EA 1108 CHN Fisons
instrument. The zeta potential (Pz) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
measurements on PD NPs in water solution were performed by a NanoBrook
Omni Particle Size Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, USA)
equipped with a 35 mW red diode laser (nominal 640 nm wavelength).
ATR spectra (380–4000 cm–1) of PD, PS-HPG,
and PSPD-HPG materials were performed by means of an FT-IR Bruker
Vertex 70 interferometer equipped with a diamond crystal single reflection
Platinum ATR accessory. The curve fitting was performed by using the
Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm implemented in the OPUS 2.0 software.
PSPD-HPGs were imaged with SEM (ZEISS LEO 1530 FEG) after metallization
with gold. The high-resolution XPS spectra were recorded with a Phoibos
100 hemispherical energy analyzer (Specs) using Mg Kα radiation
(ℏω = 1253.6 eV; X-ray power = 125 W) in a constant analyzer
energy (CAE) mode, with analyzer pass energies of 40 eV. The base
pressure in the analysis chamber during analysis was 1 × 10–9 mbar. All spectra were calibrated to the C 1s binging
energy (285.0 eV). Spectra were fitted by using CasaXPS (www.casaxps.com). The N 1s peak
was fitted by using a single Voigt curve, whereas the S 2p doublet
with 2 Voigt curves (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2) with
a constrained area ratio (2:1) and spin–orbit split S 2p1/2 – S 2p3/2 = 1.18 eV. Water contact angles
were measured by the static sessile drop method using a Digidrop GBX
Model DS. For each film, at least five drops were measured. The water
droplets used for the measurements had a volume of 1 μL.

Adsorption
Tests
Metal analyses were performed by Varian
700-ES series inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometers
(ICP-OES). Standard solutions of 5 ppm containing Cu at pH values
of 2, 3, 4, and 5 were prepared by adding a proper amount of 0.1 M
HCl or 0.1 M NaOH by means of an automatic titrator. The effect of
pH on Cu(II) adsorption was evaluated by suspending 15 mg of PSPD-HPGs
in 7.5 ml of metal standard solutions for 24 h at room temperature.
The suspensions were filtrated, and the mother waters were recovered
and analyzed for the metal content. The copper uptake curve was also
obtained by equilibrating 15 mg of PSPD-HPGs in 7.5 ml of metal standard
solutions having concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 ppm for 24 h
at room temperature. For release tests, 25 mg of PSPD-HPGs_Cu was
suspended in 12.5 mL of 0.1 M HCl, and the same amount was suspended
in 12.5 mL of ultrapure water at room temperature. After 24 h, the
solutions were separated by filtration from the solids and submitted
to ICP analysis. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the
mean values were reported. Data processing was carried out with the
ORIGIN 8.1 software (OriginLab Corporation, MA, USA). EOC adsorption
was performed by using 50 mg of adsorbent in 25 mL of EOC solution
(5 mg/L of each compound). EOC analyses were performed by HPLC (Agilent
Technologies, 1260 Infinity equipped with a variable wavelength detector)
via an optimized method using a C-8 analytical column (Agilent XDB-C8,
4.6 × 50 mm) and Milli-Q water/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (mobile
phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
A linear gradient progressed from 20% B (initial conditions) to 100%
B was used. The UV detection of each compound was done at λmax (296 nm for OFLOX, 282 nm for BP-4, and 540 nm for RhB).
The efficiencies reported in Figure 7 are the average value of three independent experiments
(± SD).

Adsorption Isotherm Modeling
The
amount of the contaminants
adsorbed at equilibrium was calculated by the equation  where C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium adsorbate
concentrations (mg/L), respectively, V (L) is the
volume of the solution, and m (g) is the mass of
the adsorbent. All the adsorption isotherm data were used for modeling.
In particular, three nonlinear isotherm models, namely, Langmuir,
Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich, were employed to correlate
the experimental data. To determine the best fit, the correlation
coefficient (R2) and the standard deviation
(± SD) for each parameter were used to evaluate the data.
