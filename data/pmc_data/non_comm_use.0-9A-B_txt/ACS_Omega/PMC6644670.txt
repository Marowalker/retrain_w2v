Recognizing
immense advantages of solution-based combustion synthesis,
its applicability to determine the extent of dissolution of Bi3+ in fluorite-structured thoria has been examined to generate
high-surface-area samples with massive defects. Up to 50 mol % of
thorium could be substituted with bismuth retaining fluorite structure
beyond which phase separation occurred. The lattice parameters from
Le-Bail refinements of their powder X-ray diffraction patterns showed
marginal increase with increase in bismuth content, suggesting the
competing effect between the size of the cation and the oxygen vacancy
concentration. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy measurements have also confirmed
the composition and structure of the limiting composition. With progressive
bismuth content, the band due to the fluorite (at 460 cm–1) diffused and a defect band in the region 570–600 cm–1 emerged in the Raman spectra. From these changes,
the oxygen vacancy concentrations in these samples have been determined,
which increased with increase in bismuth content. Absorbance in the
visible region was noticed for bismuth-containing samples, and band
gap values determined from the Kubelka–Munk function were in
the range 2.34–3.24 eV. In addition to the blue emission from
oxygen vacancies, 3P1 → 1S0 transition of Bi3+ was noticed in the photoluminescence
spectrum. From Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements,
the surface area of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ obtained by solution combustion synthesis was measured to be 265.74
m2 g–1, higher than the value (39.00
m2 g–1) for the sample prepared by solid-state
synthesis. All of these factors combined with oxygen vacancies as
defect centers have been found to play critical control over their
use as catalyst for the reductive transformation of nitroaromatics
and oxidative decolorization of organic dye molecules (methyl orange
and xylenol orange). A nice correlation between oxygen vacancy concentration
and pseudo first-order rate constants of these catalytic conversions
has been arrived. The catalyst was found to retain its efficiency
up to four cycles without undergoing any structural change during
these experiments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With
ever increasing demand of energy, research work dealing with
alternate energy generation and energy storage is on the rise. The
classical oxygen-ion conducting materials are the fluorite-structured
oxides consisting of a simple cubic oxygen lattice with occupation
of eight coordinated cations in alternate body centers. Zirconia,
thoria, ceria, and hafnia systems are some typical examples exhibiting
fluorite structure. Doping these oxide lattices with cations of lower
valence have been found to introduce oxygen vacancies, and these vacancies
have been reasoned to be responsible for high ionic conductivity promoted
by their migration.1,2 The sustainability of fluorite-structured
oxides to a high degree of substitution with other cations and thus
resulting in nonstoichiometry has been an unique feature. Extensive
investigations have been centered on doped zirconia owing to their
use as solid electrolytes in batteries, oxygen sensors, and fuel cells.3 For applications under extreme conditions (such
as oxygen pressure and/or high temperature), thoria-based solid solutions
could be ideal alternates, although conductivity of the thoria-based
solid solution was measured to be lower than that of stabilized zirconia.
The study of structure–property correlation has been facilitated
by the structural stability of thoria over a wide range of temperatures.
Other than these tetravalent containing oxides, perovskite-structured
oxides, apatites, BiMEVOX, and K2NiF4 structure
type oxides have been at the center stage of investigation to engineer
the oxide-ion conductivity effectively.1 High oxide-ion conductivity of one of the polymorphs of Bi2O3, i.e., δ-Bi2O3, as compared
to that of stabilized zirconia has attracted the attention of researchers
working in the area of solid oxide fuel cells.4,5 The
δ-Bi2O3 has a face-centered cubic defect
fluorite structure containing statistically disordered two vacant
oxide-ion sites per unit cell. Its stability at a higher temperature
range of 1003–1097 K has been brought down to room temperature
by the dissolution of trivalent lanthanides.6−16 Enormous investigations have focused on correlating disordered oxygen
vacancies influencing oxide-ion conductivity in rare earth stabilized
δ-Bi2O3 systems.17 Realizing similarity in the fluorite structure between thoria and
δ-Bi2O3, a solid solution between the
two could address various deficiencies found in the use of thoria-based
systems under extreme conditions. Such a solid solution would also
pave the way for the generation of oxygen vacancies because of the
mismatch between valence of thorium and bismuth. Oxygen vacancies
generated in an isostructural ceria (CeO2) have been found
to enhance the oxygen mobility, reduction/oxidation capability, and
thermal stability. Excellent reviews from time to time have described
the advances made using these oxygen vacancies for various catalytic
applications, including exhaust after retreatment, water–gas
shift reaction, fuel cells, CO oxidation, production, and purification
of hydrogen.18−26 Although extensive utility of oxygen vacancies present in ceria-based
catalysts has been exploited for oxidizing reactions, there exists
plenty of opportunity to be explored for reactions involving reduction.26,27

During the course of this investigation, a paper by Kanrar
et al.28 has appeared, which elaborated
oxygen vacancies,
created as a result of bismuth substitution, influencing the magnetic
ordering in these systems. The samples in this investigation have
been prepared by the solid-state reaction oxides of thorium and bismuth.
The wide window of thermal stability of solid thoria (3300 °C)
and Bi2O3 (817 °C) coupled with mismatch
in their reactivity could be the reason behind longer duration of
reaction between the metal oxides at a moderately high temperature
of 900 °C. Such a heating schedule would lead to nonstoichiometry
in the metal-ion composition. Taking cognizance of all of these gaps
and to exploit the disordered oxygen vacancies for heterogeneous catalysis,
the extent of solid solution formation between thoria and δ-Bi2O3 has been investigated by solution-based combustion
synthesis in the present study. It is worthy to note that solution
combustion method has been applied to synthesize thoria and Bi2O3 independently in nanostructures.29,30 In addition to determining the extent of dissolution of bismuth
in thoria lattice, change in the optical properties arising from bismuth
substitution has been examined. The oxygen vacancies as a consequence
of bismuth substitution have been favorably utilized for imparting
catalytic function to this system for the reductive transformation
of nitroaromatics and for the oxidative decolorization of complex
organic dye molecules, methyl orange (MO), and xylenol orange (XO).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Determination
of Solubility Limit of Bi3+ in Thoria
The pedagogical
way of steps involved
in the synthesis has been outlined as a flowchart in Figure 1. The exothermicity of combustion
reaction has been majorly controlled by the ratio of oxidant to fuel
(O/R). Citric acid (C6H8O7) being
a polyhydroxy acid could act both as a good complexing agent as well
as a fuel in combustion reaction. In terms of propellant chemistry,
the ratio of the oxidizing valency of the metal nitrates (O) to the
reducing valency of the fuel (R), i.e., O/R, should be unity to get
maximum exothermicity.31 The oxidizing
and reducing valences for the present set of reactions were calculated
by considering 3+ and 4+ oxidation states for Bi and Th, respectively,
corresponding to the starting materials employed and from the oxidation
state determination by Kanrar et al.28 The
oxidizing valences were −15 and −20 for Bi(NO3)3 and Th(NO3)4, respectively, and
the reducing valency of citric acid was 18+. According to Pederson’s
reaction model, the following combustion reactions could be conceived 1   2  The calculated
C/N ratio was around 0.277
for the reactions corresponding to eqs 1 and 2. In a similar fashion,
the C/N ratio was calculated when the amounts of these two reactants
were varied. The products from these reactions after calcination at
800 °C were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The
results from these measurements have been reproduced in Figures 2 and S1 (Supporting Information). From these patterns, it was evident that
a monophasic fluorite structure could be possible up to the inclusion
of 50 mol % of bismuth for thorium, beyond which phase separation
occurred. A similar conclusion has been arrived at by Hund32 in which solid-state reactions between thorium
nitrate and bismuth oxide were employed. The Le-Bail refinement of
PXRD patterns was carried out in Fm3̅m space group considering a defect fluorite structure (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The lattice
parameter of these compositions revealed a marginal increase with
progressive bismuth content in the samples (Figure 3i). This was matching with the trend reported
by Hund32 and differed from the report
of Kanrar et al.28 in which the cubic lattice
constant showed a marginal decrease with increasing bismuth concentration.
These variations could be the result of differing oxygen vacancy concentrations
in the samples prepared by either different starting materials or
a different route. On the basis of ionic radius considerations, Bi3+ (1.17 Å) replacing Th4+ (1.05 Å) in
8-fold coordination would be expected to result in a linear variation
of a unit cell parameter. However, the oxygen vacancies arising out
of mismatch in their oxidation states could provide coordination environment
less than eight (probably six) around bismuth. These factors could
result in non-observance of linearity in the unit cell constant variation
with increasing bismuth content in the samples. The broad band at
540 cm–1 for thoria (T1u active mode)
observed in the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) became
even more broader with the inclusion of bismuth in it (Figure S3 Supporting Information).23,24 Additionally, this band shifted to lower wave numbers with increased
bismuth content, suggesting a change in force constant by bismuth
substitution. Raman spectroscopy has been found to be a very useful
tool to study the finer local coordination environments arising from
oxygen vacancy arrangements in fluorite-structured oxides.33,34 In addition to the vibration mode characteristic for the fluorite-structured
thoria at 460 cm–1, an additional band in the vicinity
of 580–600 cm–1 was observed for bismuth-substituted
samples that was attributed to the defects present in the lattice
(Figure 3ii). Also,
Raman active mode at 460 cm–1 (T2g) reduced
in its intensity, indicating the randomness created at that crystallographic
site. On comparing the area under the peak at 460 cm–1 and the band due to oxygen vacancies at around 580 cm–1, oxygen vacancy concentration in these samples could be estimated.35 The vacancy concentration increased steadily
from 0.37 (for 10 mol % bismuth substitution) to 0.88, 2.21, 2.31,
and 2.69 for 20, 30, 40, and 50 mol % bismuth-substituted samples,
respectively. This variation clearly suggested that bismuth existed
in 3+ oxidation state, conforming well to the bond valence sum (BVS)
results (3.2) obtained from the refinement of PXRD pattern of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample with
a Bi–O bond distance of 2.466(8) Å. A similar conclusion
has also been arrived at by Kanrar et al.28 in which the samples have been made following solid-state reaction
between constituent oxides. Two emission bands at around 418 and 437
nm were noticed in photoluminescence spectra of these samples when
excited with λex = 380 nm. The band at 418 nm could
be ascribed to the emission from oxygen vacancies, whereas the other
emission at 437 nm was correlated to 3P1 → 1S0 transition of Bi3+ (Figure 4).36,37 The limiting member of this solid solution, viz., Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ was further characterized
by microscopy techniques. In scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image,
flaky morphology of the crystallites was observed, indicating a huge
amount of gas evolution during its formation (Figure 5a). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDX) spectra at various locations of this sample confirmed the uniform
presence of thorium and bismuth in the sample, and from quantification,
nearly equal concentrations of thorium and bismuth were evident (inset
of Figure 5a). The
unindexed and indexed selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
of this sample have been presented in Figure 5b,c, respectively, wherein diffused spots
in the form of rings could be located. Indexation of this pattern
yielded d-values corresponding to (111), (200), (220),
(311), and (222) hkl planes of cubic fluorite structure.
Similarly, lattice fringes with distances of 0.1766, 0.2076, and 0.2691
nm corresponding to (311), (220), and (200) hkl planes
of fluorite structure, respectively, were observed in its high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image (Figure 5d).

The optical absorption characteristics
of the samples were evaluated
by UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra. The reflectance
data has been converted into absorbance using the inbuilt software
with the instrument and presented in Figure 6. The samples showed absorption from UV to
visible region, with the absorption edge shifting progressively toward
the visible range. The direct band gap energy values of bismuth-substituted
samples were estimated using the Kubelka–Munk function. From
analysis, it was abundantly clear that the band gap value reduced
from 5.36 eV (for pure ThO2) to a range of 3.23 eV for
bismuth-containing samples.38 Within bismuth-containing
samples, band gap was found to reduce with increase in bismuth content.
The reduction in band gap reflected the creation of intermediate levels
between the valence and conduction bands of thoria. It is worth noting
that a band gap value of 2.39 eV is reported for δ-Bi2O3.39

2.2 Catalytic
Evaluation of Th1–xBixO2−δ [x =
0.50 and 0.40, Prepared by Solution Combustion
Method and x = 0.50, by Solid-State Synthesis]
As combustion synthesis has been known always to yield products
with high surface area due to the evolution of voluminous amounts
of gases during the pyrolysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ was measured. The adsorption and desorption isotherms of nitrogen
gas on this sample have been presented in Figure 7a. The sample was found to possess surface
area and pore diameter of 265.74 m2 g–1 and 15.76 nm, respectively.40 For comparison,
Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ was
also synthesized by the solid-state reaction between nitrate salts
of thorium and bismuth at 900 °C. The presence of fluorite structure
for this sample was confirmed from its PXRD pattern, and it showed
a surface area of 39.00 m2 g–1 (Figure 7b). As mentioned
earlier, oxygen vacancies in fluorite-structured ceria (either autodoped
or intentionally created by doping with aliovalent cations) have been
greatly utilized for catalytic purpose,26 higher oxygen vacancy concentration present in bismuth substituted
thoria samples has been examined for its catalytic role. Nitroaromatics
have been formed as by-products from pharmaceutical and dye industries,
and therefore their catalytic reduction would be expected to yield
value-added chemicals. p-nitrophenol (p-NP), p-nitroaniline (p-NA), and
2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) have been chosen to be model substrates to
be reduced in the presence of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ as catalyst.41 To
prove the correlation between oxygen vacancy concentration and reduction
ability of the catalyst, Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ has also been examined under similar experimental conditions for
the reduction of these three substrates. Finally, to highlight the
critical role of higher surface area of samples produced by solution
combustion synthesis, Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample obtained by the solid-state reaction has been used toward
the reduction of these three substrates.

Figure 7 (a, b) Show N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample
from solution combustion and solid-state reaction methods, respectively,
using BET method.

The results from catalytic
reduction of p-NP to p-aminophenol
(p-AP) in the presence of
NaBH4 using Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ (prepared from solution combustion synthesis and solid-state reaction)
and Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ (prepared from solution combustion synthesis) have been presented
in Figures 8a,b and S4b respectively. Without the addition of catalyst,
the absorption band of p-NP underwent a redshift
to 400 nm due to the formation of p-nitrophenoxide
ions (alkaline conditions by the introduction of NaBH4).
With the addition of these samples, dark yellow color of p-NP vanished and a new peak appeared at 300 nm, indicating the conversion
of p-NP to p-AP. Although this conversion
took place almost instantaneously (within 1–2 min) employing
Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample
prepared by solution combustion synthesis, even after 30 min of reaction,
this conversion was incomplete when Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample from solid-state reaction was
used as the catalyst. This illustrated the advantage of higher surface
area of this composition for the catalytic application when prepared
by solution combustion route. When Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ (from solution combustion synthesis)
was employed as catalyst, the conversion from p-NP
to p-AP was completed in 10 min. This indicated in
unequivocal terms the critical role played by oxygen vacancies in
these samples in enhancing the rates. As the oxygen vacancy concentration
of Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ was
less than that of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample, reduction rate was found to be slower. Although the reduction
of p-NP to p-AP using aqueous NaBH4 has been found to be thermodynamically favorable (E0 for p-NP/p-AP = −0.76 V and H3BO3/BH4– = −1.33
V versus normal hydrogen electrode), the presence of kinetic barrier
due to a large potential difference between donor and acceptor molecules
was reasoned out to decrease the feasibility of this reaction. The
samples in this study exhibiting a catalytic function might be facilitating
electron relay from the donor BH4– to acceptor p-NP to
overcome the kinetic barrier. The following steps could be involved
in the mechanism of reduction of p-NP. Chemisorption
of BH4– on the surface of catalyst followed by electron transfer from BH4– to the
catalyst might be the first step. In the second step, Bi3+ might be accepting these electrons to form Bi(0). Adsorption of p-NP on the surface of the catalyst and further the donation
of electrons from Bi(0), themselves getting reoxidized to Bi3+, might be providing p-NP molecules the required
electrons to form p-AP, followed by their desorption
in the final step.42 The formation of p-AP was further confirmed from NMR and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) techniques. The peak value with proper chemical
shifts for NMR (both 1H NMR and 13C NMR) and
mass analysis has been listed below (Figure S5 Supporting Information): 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO) δ
7.14 (d, J = 8.72 Hz, 2H), 6.80 (d, J = 8.72 Hz, 2H), 3.50 (s, 2H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 155.18, 148.79, and 115.74. HRMS (ESI) [M]+ calculated and found for [C6H7NO] were
110.0528 and 110.0600, respectively. Along similar lines, reduction
of p-NA was found to be efficiently catalyzed by
Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample
prepared from solution combustion synthesis, wherein the reduction
was found to be complete within 5 min, as indicated by decreased absorbance
intensity due to p-NA at 381 nm along with the simultaneous
appearance of peaks at 303 and 240 nm (Figure 8c). This reaction was found to be completed
in 8 min using Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ sample (prepared by the solution combustion synthesis) (Figure 8d). Using Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample from
solid-state reaction, this conversion was found to be complete in
20 min. Both Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ and Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ catalyzed selective reduction of 2,4-DNP to 2-amino-4-nitrophenol,
in 5 min, as indicated by the appearance of a band at 295 nm in the
UV–visible spectra. Even after 20 min of reaction, this conversion
was not complete employing Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample obtained from solid-state reaction.

Figure 8 (a, c,
e) Show UV–visible spectra of (a) p-NP, (c) p-NA, and (e) 2,4-DNP in the presence of
NaBH4 and Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample from solution combustion synthesis; (b, d, f) show UV–visible
spectra of p-NP, (d) p-NA, and (f)
2,4-DNP in the presence of NaBH4 and Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ sample from solution combustion
synthesis.

The applicability of these three
samples for the oxidative decolorization
of dye molecules, MO and XO has been examined. As the absorbance maxima
of MO and XO occurred at 500 and 430 nm, respectively, progress of
the reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance maxima with
time.43−45 From the results shown in Figures 9 and 10, it was found
that nearly 89 and 88% of MO and XO were decolorized in 30 and 20
min, respectively, employing Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample prepared from solution combustion synthesis.
The pseudo first-order rate constants extracted for these heterogeneous
reactions were 0.0701 min–1 (for MO) and 0.0642
min–1 (for XO). When Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ sample prepared from solution combustion
reaction was used as the catalyst, it took up to 70 min (for MO) and
60 min (for XO dye) for complete decolorization with estimated rate
constants of 0.0266 and 0.0362 min–1, respectively.
These variations indicated a direct link between oxygen vacancy concentration
and the catalytic action of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ and Th0.60Bi0.40O2−δ samples. No effect toward decolorization of
these dye molecules was observable when Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample (prepared from solid state reaction)
was used as catalyst. Hydroxide free radicals from hydrogen peroxide
could not be produced in the presence of MO alone, and therefore addition
of catalyst containing Bi3+ might be facilitating the decomposition
of H2O2 to produce free radicals, which in turn
might be rupturing the bonds between azo groups of MO, eventually
leading to decolorization. Electroactive nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur
atoms, aromatic rings, and electron-rich para quinanoid aromatic rings
constituted XO molecule. Hydroxyl radical emerged from hydrogen peroxide
due to its interaction with catalyst could be attacking the benzene
ring containing SO3– group, further leading to shifting of π bonds
of aromatic rings and decolorization of XO.46 In Figure 11a,b,
results from recyclability experiments for the reduction of p-NP and for the oxidative decolorization of MO employing
Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ (from
solution combustion synthesis) have been presented. The catalyst was
found to retain its efficiency up to four cycles of use in both cases.
The PXRD pattern of recycled catalyst showed no change in its structure,
during these experiments, hinting at its robustness (Figure 11c).

3 Conclusions
Following a solution-based
combustion synthetic approach, limit
of dissolution of bismuth in thoria retaining fluorite structure was
determined. Up to 50 mol % of bismuth could be substituted for Th4+ in thoria, which brought about dramatic changes in optical
and catalytic properties in this system. The band gap of 5.4 eV of
thoria reduced to values in the semiconducting range of 2.34–3.42
eV after substituting with bismuth. This could be due to the introduction
of intermediate levels within the valence and conduction band. Oxygen
vacancies as defects were created by the introduction of bismuth,
which confirmed its 3+ oxidation state. The existence of Bi3+ was supported additionally from BVS calculations and emission band
in PL spectra. The oxygen vacancy concentration was found to increase
with increase in bismuth content in the samples. The oxygen vacancies
combined with high surface area have been demonstrated to append catalytic
function to these samples for the reduction of nitroaromatics and
for the oxidative decolorization of complex dye molecules. A nice
correlation of reaction rates of catalysis and the oxygen vacancy
concentration in these samples has been reached. The catalytic efficiency
of Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ was
retained up to four cycles following pseudo first-order kinetics and
without undergoing any structural change. These results are believed
to enhance their further applicability in gas-phase detection and
catalytic conversion of harmful gases.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis
(BiO)2CO3 (assay of 82–85% based on metal, Central Drug House),
Th(NO3)4·5H2O (99%) (Speck pure),
citric acid (C6H8O7) (99% Bombay
Drug House), and HNO3 (68% Merck) were used as the starting
materials. Although Th(NO3)4·5H2O was soluble in double distilled water under constant stirring and
heating, bismuth oxycarbonate was converted to bismuth nitrate in
situ by reacting with minimum amount of 1:1 HNO3 solution.
The amount of citric acid for varying amounts of thorium and bismuth
nitrates was calculated using the ratio of propellant chemistry, (citrate
(fuel) to nitrate (oxidizer) ratio equal to 0.3). After the addition
of citric acid to the mixture of metal nitrates, the reaction mixture
was stirred and heated at ∼200 °C. The mixture transformed
into viscous foam, followed by auto ignition, leaving behind a black
carbonaceous foamy product. This ash product was collected and calcined
at 800 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace, followed by switching
off to cool naturally to room temperature. The details of oxidizer
(starting materials) and fuel (citric acid) taken to generate other
members of the series Th1–xBixO2−δ series have
been compiled in Table 1. Th0.50Bi0.50O2−δ sample
was also synthesized by the solid-state reaction between 0.2425 g
(0.50 mmol) of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O
[Thomas Baker 99%] and 0.2850 g (0.50 mmol) of Th(NO3)4·5H2O. The homogenized mixture of these reactants,
after grinding, was heated in a platinum crucible at 900 °C for
12 h, followed by switching off the furnace. This step was repeated
one more time.

4.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns were recorded using a high-resolution PANanalytical
X’pert diffractometer, equipped with a Xe detector employing
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a scan rate of
4.5 s per step and a step size of 0.04° over the 2θ range
of 20–70° at 25 °C. The structure refinement of the
PXRD patterns was carried out by the Le-Bail method using TOPAS3 software.47 Fourier transformed infrared red (FT-IR) spectra
were recorded using a PerkinElmer 2000 spectrometer using KBr disks.
Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw spectrometer via a microscope
system operating with an Ar+ laser (λ = 514 nm).
The morphological studies (SEM) and qualitative elemental analysis
of the samples were performed by scanning electron microscopy employing
a JEOL 6610LV microscope. High-resolution transmission electron microscopic
(HR-TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
were obtained using an FEI Technai G2 20 electron microscope operating
at 200 kV. Surface area measurements were carried out using the adsorption–desorption
method with an automated surface area and pore size analyzer (Autosorb
IQ Quantachrome instrument). UV–visible diffuse reflectance
spectra of the samples were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35
scanning double beam spectrometer equipped with a 50 mm integrating
sphere. BaSO4 was employed as the reference. Photoluminescence
spectral measurements were carried out on solid samples using the
Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer at room temperature.

4.3 Catalytic Activity Evaluation
The
oxidative decolorization of XO and MO dye molecules and reduction
of p-NP, p-NA and 2,4-DNP were chosen
to be model systems to examine the catalytic role of bismuth-containing
samples. For the oxidative decolorization experiments, 30 mg of the
sample was added to 20 mL of the dye solution (1 × 10–4 M) and 10 mL of H2O2 (30 v/v % Merck). For
catalytic reduction experiments, 30 mg of the sample along with 5
mg of NaBH4 was added to 50 mL of aqueous solutions of p-NP, p-NA, and 2,4-DNP, with an initial
concentration of 1 × 10–4 M. The progress of
catalytic experiments was followed by recording the absorbance of
the solutions at periodic time intervals using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800). The products from reduction experiments
were characterized by 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer
using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard (chemical shifts
in ppm) and using DMSO-d6 as solvent.
ESI-MS spectra were recorded on Agilent Technologies 6530 Accurate-Mass
Q-TOF LC/MS.
