Periphyton is a complex mixture of algae, microbes, inorganic sediment, and
organic matter that is attached to submerged surfaces in most flowing
freshwater systems. This natural community is known to absorb pollutants
from the water column, resulting in improved water quality. However,
the role of periphyton in the fate and transport of genetic fecal
markers suspended in the water column remains unclear. As application
of genetic-based methodologies continues to increase in freshwater
settings, it is important to identify any interactions that could
potentially confound water quality interpretations. A 16 week indoor
mesocosm study was conducted to simultaneously measure genetic fecal
markers in the water column and in the associated periphyton when
subject to wastewater source loading. Treated wastewater effluent
was pumped directly from a treatment facility adjacent to the experimental
stream facility. Inflow and outflow surface water grabs were paired
with the collection of periphyton samples taken from the mesocosm
substrates on a weekly basis. Samples were analyzed with three genetic
fecal indicator quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays
targeting Escherichia coli (EC23S857),
enterococci (Entero1), and Bacteroidales (GenBac3),
as well as, two human host-associated fecal pollution markers (HF183
and HumM2). In addition, periphyton dry mass was measured. During
wastewater effluent loading, genetic markers were detected in periphyton
at frequencies up to 100% (EC23S857, Entero1, and GenBac3), 59.4%
(HF183), and 21.9% (HumM2) confirming sequestration from the water
column. Mean net-flux shifts in water column inflow and outflow genetic
indicator concentrations further supported interactions between the
periphyton and water column. In addition, positive correlations were
observed between periphyton dry mass and genetic marker concentrations
ranging from r = 0.693 (Entero1) to r = 0.911 (GenBac3). Overall, findings support the notion that genetic
markers suspended in the water column can be trapped by periphyton,
further suggesting that the benthic environment in flowing freshwater
systems may be an important factor to consider for water quality management
with molecular methods.

==== Body
Introduction
Periphyton
is a complex biological matrix that mainly includes
algae, cyanobacteria, fine inorganic sediment, microbes, and organic
detritus that are attached to submerged surfaces in most flowing freshwater
systems.1 Periphyton is typically found
in shallow areas of lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers and is a major
food source for many invertebrates and fishes. It is also known to
sequester many pollutants, such as inorganic nutrients,2 heavy metals,2 and
even Escherichia coli cells, originating
from sewage.3 This natural process can
help improve water quality, but recent studies also suggest that sequestered
pollutants can become concentrated in periphyton and resuspended into
the water column under certain conditions.3

Advances in environmental science now offer genetic methods
to
characterize the level and sources of fecal pollution in natural settings.4−7 These technologies are more rapid than traditional cell-based fecal
indicator bacteria (FIB) cultivation approaches, and some can even
discriminate human waste from other animal pollution sources. However,
it remains unclear whether these genetic fecal markers can interact
with periphyton communities in a similar fashion as other pollutants.
Previous studies report genetic marker interactions with beach sands8−12 and submerged aquatic vegetation,13−15 but little is known
about periphyton.

In this study, indoor mesocosms at the U.S.
EPA Experimental Stream
Facility (ESF) were used to simultaneously measure FIB (E. coli, enterococci, and Bacteroidales) and human-associated genetic markers in the water column and associated
periphyton when subjected to treated wastewater point source loading.
Paired measurements were analyzed to characterize the capacity of
the periphyton to sequester fecal genetic markers from the water column.
In addition, water column inflow and outflow genetic marker concentrations
were investigated for evidence of a biofiltration effect, as well
as, genetic marker resuspension events under test conditions. Overall,
findings support the notion that genetic markers in the water column
can be absorbed by periphyton, and in some instances resuspended,
suggesting that the benthic environment in flowing freshwater systems
is an important factor to consider for water quality management with
molecular indicators.

Experimental Section
Experimental Design
Paired water column and periphyton
samples (n = 64) were collected over a 16 week period
(weekly basis) from two mesocosm reaches (Figure S1) housed at the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) Experimental Stream Facility (Milford, OH), as previously
described.16,17 Briefly, mesocosm 1 received
water from the East Fork Tributary (EFK), a fifth order tributary
draining 1300 km2 of agricultural dominated lands, and
Mesocosm 2 received water from the Heiserman Stream Tributary (HST),
a first order headwater draining 1.1 km2 of mostly forested
land. Each mesocosm consisted of a two concatenated 12 m channels
made up of a head tank, upstream section containing sterilized, unglazed
ceramic tiles (tile area = 144 cm2; 141 tiles/channel),
providing standardized substrate for periphyton analysis, downstream
section with river gravel, and a tail tank.17 Flow to each mesocosm was regulated via a diaphragm valve controlled
by a linear actuator (A300 Poscon Electric Actuator) wired to a Foxboro
magnetic flow meter (model 801H-WCT). Stormflow hydrology simulations
(see Supporting Information for details)
were triggered by local rain events (≥0.01 mm/min) measured
from a meteorological station located outside the facility. The experiment
was divided into two 8 week study periods from June to September including
a periphyton colonization period (stream water only for 8 weeks) followed
by a wastewater loading phase (stream water + wastewater for 8 weeks)
simulating a point source discharge. Treated wastewater effluent was
pumped directly to experimental mesocosms at a rate of 2 gal/min of
sewage (13 gal/min stream baseflow) from the Lower East Fork Waste
Water Treatment Plant (Milford, OH) to simulate the discharge of human
fecal pollution at a rate typical of wastewater discharge into a receiving
stream during summer low-flow conditions (see Supporting Information for more detailed information).

Water
Column and Periphyton Sampling
For each sampling
event, 100 mL of water column samples was collected and processed
separately from the head and tail tank of each mesocosm, as previously
described.18 Each water sample was filtered
through a 0.2 μm Supor-200 filter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Pittsburg, PA), placed in a sterile 2.0 mL screw cap tube containing
a silica bead mill matrix (GeneRite, North Brunswick, NJ), and stored
at −80 °C until time of molecular analysis (<6 months).
For periphyton collection, two tiles were randomly selected from the
upstream portion of each channel (total of 4 tiles/mesocosm). Using
a sterile spatula, a 36 cm2 of area was scraped from each
tile and placed in a 50 mL polypropylene tube (total area sampled
= 144 cm2). Tile scrapings from each channel (4 tiles total)
were then homogenized in a MP FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals, LLC Solon,
OH) at 6.0 m/s for 60 s with the addition of lysing matrix A (garnet
matrix + 0.25 in ceramic sphere). For each homogenized sample, approximately
2 g was stored in a low-adhesion microcentrifuge tube (ISC BioExpress,
Kaysville, UT) and stored at −80 °C until time of molecular
analysis (<6 months). For periphyton dry mass (PDM) measurements,
the remaining homogenized material (108 cm2) was weighed,
dried at 75 °C for 48 h, and reweighed to determine total dry
mass. PDM was reported as an aerial density (mg/cm2)

Water Physiochemical and Periphyton Measurements
Water
properties, including conductivity (μS/cm), temperature (°C),
dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and pH, were measured every 5 min at the
inlet and outlet of each mesocosm (Figure S1), as previously described.17,19

Molecular Analysis
DNA
Extraction
Water column sample DNA extractions
were performed with the DNA-EZ Kit (GeneRite North Brunswick, NJ),
as previously described.20 DNA extraction
of 0.1 g of each homogenized periphyton sample was performed using
the PowerBiofilm DNA isolation kit (MoBio Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacture instructions.

Reference DNA Material
Preparation
Reference DNA materials
consisted of plasmid constructs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
IA) and salmon testes DNA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Please refer
to the Supporting Information for details
on preparation and storage procedures.

Quantitative Real-Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) Amplification
All DNA extracts
were subject to qPCR testing with three FIB assays
(GenBac3,21 Entero1,22,23 EC23S85724) and two human-associated
methods (HF1835 and HumM26) as well as a sample processing control (SPC) assay (Sketa2223). All reaction mixtures contained 1× TaqMan
Universal MasterMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY),
0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1 μM
each primer, 80 nM 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled probe, and 80
nM VIC-labeled probe. Multiplex reaction mixtures contained 102 copies (Entero1, EC23S857, HumM2, and HF183) or 103 copies (GenBac3) of IAC template combined with either PCR grade
water, 10 to 1 × 105 target gene copies of reference
DNA standard material, or 2 μL of DNA sample extract in a total
reaction volume of 25 μL. A minimum of two reactions was performed
for each DNA extract using a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time Sequence Detector
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). All reactions were performed
in MicroAmp Optical 96-well plates with MicroAmp 96-well Optical Adhesive
Film (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). The thermal cycling
profile for all assays was 2 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles
of 5 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The threshold for each
assay was manually set to 0.03 (GenBac3, Entero1, HF183, EC23S857,
and Sketa22) or 0.008 (HumM2), and quantification cycle (Cq) values were exported to Microsoft Excel.

Quality Assurance
Measures
This section describes quality
assurance measures for molecular analysis, including extraneous DNA
controls, calibration model performance, amplification inhibition
screening, and SPC. To monitor for false positives, a minimum of four
no-template controls and three method extraction blanks were included,
where laboratory grade water was substituted for environmental samples
for each instrument run and sample batch, respectively. Calibration
models generated from repeated testing of reference DNA standard material
for Entero1, GenBac3, EC23S857, HF183, and HumM2 assays were evaluated
based on linearity (R2), amplification
efficiency (E = 10(−1/–slope) – 1), range of quantification (ROQ), and lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ). An IAC was used to evaluate the suitability of isolated DNA
for qPCR amplification was performed on each DNA extract for Entero1,
GenBac3, EC23S857, HF183, and HumM2 assays. The criterion for concluding
no significant amplification inhibition was established for each assay
and sample type (water or periphyton) as the mean cycle threshold
(Cq) calculated from 27 repeated experiments
measuring Cq values from control reactions
containing 102 (Entero1, EC23S857, and HF183, HumM2) to
103 (GenBac3) copies of the respective IAC in laboratory
grade water only plus 1.5Cq. Water or
periphyton test samples exhibiting amplification inhibition were discarded
from the study. To monitor for variability in sample processing efficiency,
each water filter and periphyton composite sample were spiked with
a fixed concentration of salmon sperm DNA, and the resulting DNA elute
was tested with the Sketa22 qPCR assay as previously described.23 Water filter and periphyton sample processing
acceptance thresholds were calculated based on repeated control experiments
(n = 60 for water; n = 36 for periphyton),
where laboratory grade water was substituted for test sample material
(water or periphyton). For spiked water sample DNA extracts, Sketa22 Cq measurements greater than 27.3 (24.3 mean Cq + 3) indicated an unacceptable sample processing
efficiency. For periphyton DNA extracts, the acceptance threshold
was 24.3Cq (21.3 mean Cq + 3). DNA extracts failing the sample processing control
were discarded from the study.

Data Analysis
Master calibration curves and unknown
DNA concentration estimates were determined using a Markov chain Monte
Carlo approach on publicly available software WinBUGS, version 1.4.1.25 For quantitative data interpretation, the lower
limit of quantification (LLOQ) was defined as the 95% credible interval
upper bound from repeated measures (n = 18) of respective
10 copy reference DNA standard. For qualitative data interpretation,
a positive detection was defined as any Cq less than or equal to the respective qPCR assay LLOQ. Genetic marker
concentrations in water column samples are expressed as mean log10 copies/100 mL, whereas periphyton densities are reported
as mean log10 copies/cm2. Student-t tests were used to identify any significant differences (α
= 0.05) in PDM between water sources and study period. Potential interactions
of FIB in water column with periphyton were investigated by calculating
a net flux (log10 copies/min) for each FIB marker, water
source, and sampling date combination 1  For log10 Fnet determination, FIB marker measurements below the respective
LLOQ were assigned a value of log10 (0.1) copies/min.
If log10 Fin and Fout for a FIB marker, water source, and sampling
date pairing were both below the LLOQ, then log10 Fnet was designated as no change. All statistical
analyses were performed with SAS (Cary, NC), Rstudio (version 0.99.902)
and SigmaPlot (version 13).

Results
Water Column
Water physiochemical parameters observed
during the study period are shown in Table 1. Genetic marker detection frequencies varied
by assay, inflow/outflow sampling point, and experiment period (Table 2). FIB markers (GenBac3,
EC23S858, and Entero1) detection frequencies were consistently high,
ranging from 87.5 to 100%, regardless of experiment period or water
source (Table 2). The
introduction of treated wastewater increased human-associated genetic
marker detection frequencies in water samples by at least 68.7% for
HF183 and 31.3% for HumM2. The concentrations of FIB and human-associated
genetic markers for all samples are shown in Figure 1. No significant difference (p ≥ 0.06) was observed between water sources or experimental
periods for FIB genetic markers except GenBac3 (p ≤ 0.001). In contrast, human-associated genetic marker concentrations
reached as high as 4.12 log10 copies/100 mL (HF183) and
3.54 log10 copies/100 mL (HumM2) after the addition of
treated wastewater.

PDM ranged from 1.60
to 3.05 log10 mg/cm2 for EFK and from 1.22 to
2.48 log10 mg/cm2 for HST over the study period
(Figure 2). Overall,
PDM levels in EFK
and HST reaches were significantly different (p <
0.001). In addition, PDM levels in experiment period 1 were significantly
lower than period 2 in HST (p < 0.001), but not
in EFK (p = 0.1). FIB genetic marker frequencies
were always 100%, regardless of experimental period (Table 2). In contrast, human-associated
genetic marker detection frequencies increased by at least 43.7% for
HF183 and 15.6% for HumM2 in periphyton samples during the treated
wastewater loading period. The concentrations of FIB and human-associated
genetic markers are shown in Figure 1. Concentrations of FIB genetic markers were not significantly
different between water sources (p ≥ 0.973).
However, concentrations were always significantly higher (p > 0.0001) in experimental period 2. For human-associated
genetic markers, quantifiable levels were only observed during the
treated wastewater loading period (Figure 1).

Water Column and Periphyton Interactions
A negative
net-flux ratio (log10 Fnet < 0) suggests that the periphyton is sequestering genetic markers,
whereas a positive net-flux ratio (log10 Fnet > 0) implies the opposite (Table 3). Net-flux log10 copies/min ranged from −0.41 (June 29, HST) to 7.9 (June
1, EFK) for GenBac3, from −6.61 (August 17, HST) to 7.36 (June
1, EFK) for EC23S857, and from −0.15 (June 22, HST) to 7.41
(June 1, EFK) for Entero1. Interestingly, the highest observed positive
net-flux ratio for all FIB markers occurred in the EFK mesocosm on
June 1st coinciding with the most severe storm event (flow rate =
38.6 L/min) over the course of the study. To further characterize
potential interactions, correlations between FIB genetic markers (mean
log10 copies/cm2) and PDM (mg/cm2) were determined for each water source (Figure S3). In all instances, a significant correlation was observed
(r ≥ 0.762; p ≤ 0.003).

Quality Assurance Measures
qPCR calibration model and
quality assurance parameters are summarized in Table 4. ROQ was 10–105 copies/reaction
for all assays (range tested). Briefly, R2 values were ≥ 0.989, and amplification efficiencies ranged
from 0.93 (Entero1) to 1.08 (HumM2). Extraction blank and no-template
controls indicated absence of contamination in 99.9% of control reactions
(699 of 700). A periphyton sample (0.03%) and five water column samples
(1.6%) showed amplification inhibition (data not shown). Sample processing
controls identified 8.6% (11 of 128) DNA preparations with inadequate
extraction recovery. All nonqualified samples were removed from study.

Discussion
Evidence for Genetic Marker Interaction between Water Column
and Periphyton
In this study, we measured FIB and human-associated
genetic markers in artificial streams to characterize potential interactions
between the water column and periphyton when subjected to treated
wastewater loading. Findings provide direct evidence for an interaction
between DNA targets suspended in the water column and periphyton.
Genetic marker sequestration could result from a number of processes
ranging from settling to sorption. Periphyton offers ample surface
area for interaction with genetic markers as well as protection from
sunlight irradiation and predation from indigenous microbes in the
water column. Previous studies report prolonged survival of culturable E. coli in sands,11,12,26 submerged aquatic vegetation,14,15,27 as well as periphyton.3,13,28 However, it remains unclear that whether
genetic markers can survive for a longer period of time once trapped
in periphyton, as compared to remaining in the water column. A comparison
of water column mean inflow and outflow flux FIB concentrations indicates
that periphyton can act as a natural biofilter for genetic markers.
This notion is further supported by the increase in detection and
concentration of human-associated genetic markers in periphyton during
treated wastewater loading (Table 1; Figure 1). However, the partitioning of genetic markers between the water
column and periphyton is clearly dynamic and complex. Individual sample
event net-flux (log10 Fnet) comparisons show that under certain conditions, periphyton may
act as a natural reservoir leading to resuspension of genetic markers
into the water column (Table 3). Additional research is warranted to investigate mechanisms,
die-off trends, and the influence of factors, such as stress from
turbulent flow and periphyton natural growth cycles, on genetic marker
sequestration and resuspension.

Implications for Water
Quality Management
Periphyton
biofilms have rapid colonization rates, short life cycles, and are
sensitive to a wide array of pollutants making them valuable indicators
of short-term water quality impacts. A recent study even suggests
that periphyton can influence chlorophyll-a levels
helping to regulate harmful algal blooms in eutrophic lakes.29 Here, we demonstrate that genetic markers from
fecal pollutants initially suspended in the water column are readily
trapped in periphyton. This has potential ramifications for water
quality management. For example, molecular analysis of periphyton
may reveal information about recent fecal pollution contamination
events. Indeed, human-associated genetic markers were identified in
periphyton samples only after wastewater was introduced into mesocosms
(Table 1; Figure 1). Another important
consideration is the potential ability of periphyton to act as a natural
reservoir of genetic markers. It is possible that genetic markers
could be released from periphyton potentially biasing future water
quality tests, especially after large shifts in stream natural flow
rates. It is also important to note that if genetic markers from FIB
and human-associated bacteria can be trapped in periphyton, then it
is likely that disease causing pathogens could too. Other secondary
habitats, such as beach sands, have been shown to harbor pathogens
with potential public health risk implications suggesting that a similar
scenario may be possible for periphyton.26,30 Future studies are needed to characterize what constituents in fecal
pollution are sequestered in periphyton, and whether fecal indicators
and pathogens only accumulate or can proliferate potentially confounding
future water quality monitoring efforts.

Conclusions
Experiments
demonstrate the ability of stream periphyton to interact
with FIB and human-associated genetic markers in the water column.
The capacity to trap genetic markers appears to be a function of periphyton
mass. In addition, the presence of human-associated genetic markers
was apparent only after the addition of wastewater suggesting that
periphyton testing can reveal information about recent fecal contamination
episodes. These trends represent the first steps toward understanding
the role periphyton plays in natural freshwater systems during and
after a fecal pollution event. Future studies will likely reveal additional
information on periphyton genetic marker biofiltration and resuspension
dynamics leading to interaction models that can predict potential
impacts on water quality monitoring.
