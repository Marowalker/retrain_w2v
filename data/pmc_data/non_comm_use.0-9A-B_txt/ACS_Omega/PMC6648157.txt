Introduction
Substituted dihydrofurans
are one class of important heterocycles
frequently found in many natural products (e.g., azadirachtin, austocystin
A, etc.) and in a number of pharmaceuticals (e.g., aflatoxin B1, clerodin,
etc.).1,2 In addition, they display important biological
activities and are widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry.1 Due to their diverse applications in organic
synthesis, a large number of synthetic chemists have become interested
in substituted dihydrofurans and many synthetic methodologies have
been developed.3 Among the reported methodologies,
radicals, carbenoids, ylides, and heavy metals have been frequently
utilized; however, these procedures lack green chemical protocols.
Thus, it is highly desirable to develop green methodologies in an
environmentally benign way.4

In 2008,
Chuang and co-workers described a base-catalyzed method
for the synthesis of 2,3-dihydrofurans employing 3-benzylidene-2,4-pentanediones
and α-nitro carbonyl compounds.5 Shi
et al. reported a three-component reaction of nitroalkenes, aldehydes,
and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to construct dihydrofurans using catalytic
amounts of proline and potassium carbonate.6 Yu and co-workers also reported a base-mediated tandem reaction
of nitrostyrene with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to prepare dihydrofurans.7 In 2013, Zhang and co-workers reported 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO)-mediated organocatalyzed anion relay cascade of 1-cinnamoylcyclopropanecarboxamides
for the construction of 2,3-dihydrofurans.8 In the same year, Chen and co-workers developed phosphine-catalyzed
reaction between Morita–Baylis–Hillman carbonates and
α,β-unsaturated α-ketoesters to furnish 2,3-dihydrofurans.9 In the next year, Zhu et al. published KOH-mediated
domino reaction of N-sulfonyl-1-aza-1,3-dienes with
2-halo-1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to synthesize differently substituted
2,3-dihydrofuran derivatives.10 Very recently,
Worgull’s group has shown an access to tetrasubstituted 2,3-dihydrofurans
starting from benzylidene dicarbonyls and bromo acetophenones through
chiral ammonium ylides.11 However, to the
best of our knowledge, dihydrofurans having cyano group in the ring
have hardly been reported. Only You and co-workers showed an example
of cyano-containing dihydrofuran via Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed
cyclization of α-cyano ketone with low yield (Scheme 1).3a Realizing the potential of dihydrofurans in medicinal chemistry,
we embark in developing a convenient method for the synthesis of dihydrofurans
having cyano group by reacting α-cyano-enones and α-nitroketones.
We also wish to report 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)-promoted
Michael-acyl transfer-elimination sequence between unsaturated α-ketoesters
and α-nitroketones for the synthesis of conjugated dienes. Previously,
only Michael-acyl transfer reaction was reported.12

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Cyano-Containing Dihydrofurans and Reactions
of α-Nitroketones
with α,β-Unsaturated α-Ketoesters
Results and Discussion
Initially,
a model reaction was studied between trans-α-cyano-α,β-unsaturated
ketone 1a and 2-nitro-1-phenylethanone (2a)13 using different bases in chloroform
solvent at room temperature
(rt) (Table 1). Using
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as base, the desired product 3a was formed in only 10% yield as a single trans-diastereomer
and the product was confirmed by 1H, 13C NMR
analysis. Interestingly, no product was formed with inorganic base
like potassium carbonate (entry 2). Gratifyingly, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine
(TMG) promoted the reaction efficiently to provide 75% yield of the
single diastereomeric product (entry 3). The yield increased with
diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (entry 4). Finally, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) was found to be the most efficient base and an excellent yield
of 92% was achieved after 30 min (entry 5). Other solvents were also
screened, but better result was not achieved (entries 6 and 7). For
example, 90% yield was obtained in toluene and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) provided 85% yield of the product (see Supporting Information for details).

After obtaining
the optimized conditions, we ventured in the generality
and scope of the reaction. Initially, the aryl group of ketone motif
in 1 was varied, and the results are summarized in Table 2. First, enones 1b–e having para-substitutions were evaluated
and good results were achieved (entries 2–5). For example,
enone 1c having 4-anisyl group reacted efficiently to
provide the product 3c in 94% yield (entry 3). Similarly,
4-halo substitutions also were well tolerated and acceptable yields
were observed (entries 4 and 5). The reactions also worked with meta-substituted
enone 1f and product 3f was isolated in
83% yield (entry 6). Heteroaromatic group-containing enone 1g was employed to obtain the product 3g in 83% yield
(entry 7). Finally, aliphatic enone 1h was also well
tolerated in our reaction and delivered 80% yield of the product 3h (entry 8). Then, we turned our attention to change the
olefin aryl group of enone 1 (entries 9–19). Here
also good to high yields were obtained with different aryl groups
(entries 9–16). Acceptable yields were attained with para-substituted
aryl group-containing enones such as 1i and 1j (entries 9–10). Electron-deficient group was also tolerated
and product 3k was isolated in 77% yield (entry 11).
Biphenyl group-containing enone 1l also participated
in the reaction to deliver product 3l in 81% yield (entry
12). Then, meta-substitutions were checked, and to our delight, better
results were achieved (entries 13 and 14). Product 3m having meta-tolyl substitution was isolated in
89% yield, and its structure was unambiguously determined by X-ray
(entry 13).14 Excellent yield was observed
for meta-bromo-substituted enone (entry 14). Smooth
conversion was also detected with ortho-substituted aryl enone 1o (entry 15). Next, 2,4-disubstituted aryl group-containing
enone 1p was employed and product 3p was
obtained in acceptable yield (entry 16). However, lower yields were
detected when heteroaromatic 2-furyl and 3-pyridyl groups were incorporated
(entries 17 and 18). Finally, an aliphatic cyclohexyl-substituted
enone 1s was engaged in the reaction and gratifyingly
moderate yield was obtained (entry 19).

Afterward,
different α-nitroketones were evaluated under
similar reaction conditions and pleasingly here also, good results
were obtained (Table 3). Initially, 4-methyl-substituted α-nitroketone 2b was tested and the product 3t was isolated in 92% yield
(entry 1). Our methodology was also suitable for 4-alkoxy-substituted
α-nitroketones 2c and 2d and good
yields were achieved for products 3u and 3v (entries 2 and 3). Then, 4-halo substitutions were checked and interestingly
varied results were obtained (entries 4 and 5). Although nitroketone 2e having 4-fluoro substitution provided 78% yield of the
desired product 3w, poor yield was observed for 3x having 4-chloro substitution. Then, biphenyl motif containing
nitroketone 2g was employed and a gratifyingly high yield
of 89% was attained for product 3y (entry 6). Meta-substitution
was also tolerated and product 3z was obtained in 63%
yield (entry 7). Smooth conversion was also detected with 2,4-disubstituted
aryl group-containing enone 2i, and the corresponding
product 3z′ was isolated in 72% yield (entry 8).
Finally, an aliphatic nitroketone 1h having nhexyl group was prepared and employed in the reaction.
Gratifyingly, the reaction progressed well to deliver product 3z″ in 68% yield (entry 9).

To expand
the scope of the reaction, we employed nitroester 4 and
α-branched nitroketone 2k in the
reaction (Scheme 2).
Gratifyingly, the reaction progressed well in both cases to deliver
products 5 and 6, respectively, in good
yields. Although the diastereoselectivity of product 5 was excellent, product 6 was obtained as a mixture
of diastereomers.

Scheme 2 Employment of Nitroester 4 and Nitroketone 2k
Then, we envisioned
to study a reaction between α,β-unsaturated
α-ketoester 7a and nitroketone 2a with
DBU (Scheme 3). Interestingly,
after stirring for 1 day in chloroform solvent, diene product 8a was obtained via Michael-acyl transfer-elimination cascade.
Encouraged by this result, we employed a range of unsaturated-α-ketoesters 7 in the reaction. First, the aryl group was modified and
different substitutions were incorporated. The reaction worked well
with ketoesters 7b and 7c having para-substituted
aryl groups. Although the products 8b and 8c were isolated in acceptable yields, a slightly less yield was observed
for product 8d having 4-nitro substitution. Ketoester 7e having meta-substituted aryl group also participated in
the reaction and moderate yield was detected for 8e.
Then, an ethyl ester was screened and interestingly, the yield increased
for the product 8f. We also checked ketoester 7g having 2-thienyl group and cyclohexyl-substituted ketoester 7h. However, no desired product was formed in both cases.

Scheme 3 Reaction of α,β-Unsaturated α-Ketoesters 7 with Nitroketone 2a,
Reactions were carried out with
0.3 mmol of 7 and 0.3 mmol of 2a using 0.3
mmol of DBU in 3 mL of CHCl3 at rt for 1 day.

Isolated yield after silica gel column
chromatography.

Then, we turned our attention
to engage different α-nitroketones
in this reaction (Scheme 4). Initially, different para-substituted aryl group-containing
α-nitroketones were investigated and, to our delight, the products 8i–k were isolated in acceptable yields.
A similar yield was detected for product 8l having meta-substitution.
2,4-Disubstitution was also tolerated and product 8m was
isolated in 72% yield. Moreover, heteroaryl and aliphatic nitroketones
could also be employed and the corresponding products 8n and 8o were obtained in good yield. Finally, α-branched
nitroketone 2k was screened to deliver product 8p with perfect selectivity.

Scheme 4 Reaction of Unsaturated
α-Ketoester 7a with Nitroketones 2,,
Reactions were carried out with
0.3 mmol of 7a and 0.3 mmol of 2 using 0.3
mmol of DBU in 3 mL of CHCl3 at rt for 1 day.

Isolated yield after silica gel column
chromatography.

2k used as starting material.

A plausible mechanism
for the formation of 3a and 8a is shown
in Scheme 5. It can
be expected that DBU will first deprotonate nitroketone 2a and enable a conjugate addition reaction to cisoid enone 1a′ to deliver intermediate A. Finally, an intramolecular
substitution reaction provides 3a with the removal of
nitro group. In a similar way, deprotonated nitroketone undergoes
conjugate addition to unsaturated α-ketoester 7a to generate intermediate B. Hemiketalization of B provides C, which
on retro-Henry reaction affords D. Finally, DBU-mediated elimination
of HNO2 from D delivers 8a.

Scheme 5 Plausible Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed efficient syntheses of dihydrofurans
and conjugated dienes via reaction of α-nitroketones with trans-α-cyano-α,β-unsaturated ketones
and α,β-unsaturated α-ketoesters, respectively. The products were obtained in
good to high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities were attained
for dihydrofurans. Given the high importance of dihydrofurans and
conjugated dienes in synthetic organic chemistry, our method might
be beneficial to prepare these compounds in a convenient way.

Experimental
Section
General Information
For the experiments, all starting
materials and reagents were purchased from standard commercial sources
or were prepared in the laboratory. All reactions were carried out
in oven-dried glassware under air with magnetic stirring. All other
solvents and reagents were purified according to standard procedures.
Organic solvents were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure.
Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica
gel GF-254 using a combination of hexane and ethyl acetate as eluents.
For column chromatography, silica gel (60–120 mesh size) was
used.

1H NMR spectra were recorded on 400 and 600
MHz spectrometers at 295 K in CDCl3; chemical shift values
(δ, ppm) and coupling constants (Hz) are reported in the standard
fashion with reference to either tetramethylsilane (δ(H) 0.00
ppm) or CHCl3 (δ(H) 7.26 ppm). 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on 100 and 150 MHz spectrometers at 298 K in
CDCl3; chemical shifts (δ, ppm) are reported relative
to CHCl3 (δ(C) 77.23 ppm), central line of triplet.
In the 13C NMR spectra, the nature of the carbons (C, CH,
CH2, and CH3) was determined by recording the
DEPT-135 spectra. IR spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform
infrared instrument at normal temperature, making the KBr pellet grind
the sample with KBr (IR grade). High-resolution mass spectra were
recorded by quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) electron spray ionization
(ESI). DBU was purchased from Spectrochem and used without further
purification.
