Herein, we report on one-dimensional
porous Au-modified LaFeO3 nanobelts (NBs) with high surface
area, which were synthesized
through the electrospinning method. The incorporation and coverage
of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of the LaFeO3 NBs
was achieved by adjusting the HAuCl amount in the precursor solution.
Successful incorporation of Au NPs was examined by X-ray diffraction,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. The gas-sensing performance of both the pure and Au/LaFeO3 NB-based sensors was tested toward 2.5–40 ppm of acetone
at working temperatures in the range from room temperature to 180
°C. The gas-sensing findings revealed that Au/LaFeO3 NB-based sensor with the Au concentration of 0.3 wt % displayed
improved response of 125–40 ppm of acetone and rapid response
and recovery times of 26 and 20 s, respectively, at an optimal working
temperature of 100 °C. Furthermore, all sensors demonstrated
an excellent response toward acetone and remarkable selectivity against
NO2, NH3, CH4, and CO. Hence, the
Au/LaFeO3-NB-based sensor is a promising candidate for
sensitive, ultrafast, and selective acetone detections at low concentrations.
The gas-sensing mechanism of the Au/LaFeO3 sensors is explained
in consideration of the catalytic activity of the Au NPs, which served
as direct adsorption sites for oxygen and acetone.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In a quest for better
living conditions through industrialization,
comes the disadvantage of increase in air pollution by different types
of toxic chemical compounds in air that can be harmful to human health.
Acetone (C3H6O) is one of the potential volatile
organic compounds with an aromatic smell used in medicine, coatings,
and pesticides.1−3 However, long exposure to certain concentrations
of acetone may cause human health impact, such as eye, nose, and central
nervous system damage.4,5 Nonetheless, acetone has been
classified as a useful component used as a breath biomarker for noninvasive
diagnosis of type-1 diabetes.6 It is reported
that the average acetone concentration level for healthy human breath
is 0.9 ppm, whereas for a diabetic patient, it’s more than
1.8 ppm.7 Therefore, it is essential to
fabricate a sensor exhibiting high sensitivity, quick response/recovery
time, and good stability at low concentrations of acetone.

Semiconductor
metal oxides (SMO) have been regarded as a promising
group of sensing materials because of their ease in fabrication, low
cost, and sensitivity to a variety of reducing and oxidizing gases.8−13 This group of sensing materials can be synthesized in a variety
of dimensions ranging from 0 to 3 dimensions (0D–3D), with
all different dimensions revealing different sensing properties.14−16 Of all different dimensions of SMO, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures,
such as nanorods,17 nanotubes,18 nanofibers,19 and
nanobelts (NBs),20,21 have been proven to give better
gas-sensing performance since they possess large surface area and
a strong adsorption/desorption ratio of the analyte gas molecules.22−25 As one of the structures categorized under 1D family, nanobelts
(NBs) are of particular interest as they display high surface area
with interparticle contact, which are key parameters to facilitate
the adsorption/desorption of gas molecules, thus contributing toward
sensor performance enhancement.26

SMOs with n-type conductivity are mostly utilized as compared with
the p-type counterparts since Hübner et al.27 validated that the gas response obtained for a p-type material
is a square root of the response of an n-type material having the
same morphology. Nonetheless, p-type SMOs have distinctive catalytic
activity with different volatile organic compounds,28,29 thus making them potential candidates for the fabrication of innovative
functionality in high-performance gas sensor devices. However, to
successfully attain such innovation, it is of paramount importance
to improve the gas response characteristics of these p-type SMOs to
satisfy the demands for practical application, such as high sensitivity,
selectivity, and fast response/recovery speed at low working temperatures
to low concentration levels of analyte gas. For this reason, a number
of strategies, ranging from construction of heterojunction composites,30,31 control and variation of morphology,32,33 UV light stimulation,34,35 and noble metal functionalization,36,37 have been
adopted to overcome these hurdles. The aforementioned alterations
can expose more surface area, thus increasing more active sites and
effectively promote electron transfer, therefore resulting in improved
gas-sensing performance.38

Incorporation
of noble metals, such as Ag, Au, and Pd, has been
proven to be more effective since noble metals bring about a chemical
catalytic effect, whereby the noble metal acts as direct active sites
for the adsorption of analyte gas and assists in the chemical reactions
between the analyte gas and the sensing material.1,18,39−43 Additionally, the noble metals can also fast-track
the transfer of electrons to the surfaces of the sensing material.38,44 These effects in gas sensing have been proven in many research works;
for instance, Jin et al.45 produced SnO2 nanobelts functionalized with Au, which revealed decreased
response and recovery times with higher response toward ethanol as
compared with bare SnO2. In another work by Majhi et al.,46 it was found that Au@NiO core–shell nanoparticles
revealed higher response than the pristine NiO nanoparticles to 100
ppm of ethanol at 200 °C.

Of all p-type SMOs that can be
used in gas-sensing applications,
LaFeO3 has been identified as a promising gas sensor material
due to its interesting properties, such high electrical conductivity
and catalytic activity, for surface-driven redox reactions.47−51 Moreover, its perovskite multimetal structure allows manipulation
of its properties due to overlap between filled O2– p-orbitals and the unfilled orbitals of the metal cations in relation
to their monometal counterparts.52 As much
as LaFeO3 is a well-known p-type SMO, only a few studies
have been reported on the effects of noble metal catalysts (i.e.,
Ag) loading on its sensing abilities.53,54 Moreover,
reports on using Au as a catalyst for LaFeO3 sensing are
very scarce, especially for acetone sensing. Therefore, more investigations
are needed to elucidate the Au-loading effects since Au is commended
as a very good catalyst that can induce chemical sensitization, thus
resulting in enhanced gas-sensing characteristics.37,44,55,56

In this
context, this work focuses on the fabrication of Au-loaded
LaFeO3 NBs at different Au loading levels to investigate
the effects that Au brings about on the gas-sensing performance of
the LaFeO3 NBs. Coupling the 1D NB morphology of LaFeO3 with the catalytic activity of Au, the structural, morphological,
and most crucially the gas-sensing performance will be thoroughly
studied to establish the influence of Au loading. A possible gas-sensing
mechanism will also be discussed to demonstrate the interaction taking
place between the analyte gas and the sensor material surface.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials Used
Lanthanum nitrate
hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O),
ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe (NO3)3·9H2O), gold(III) chloride solution (HAuCl4), and poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) were used as the starting materials without further purification.
The solvents used were N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) and ethanol.

2.2 Preparation of the Electrospinning
Precursor
Solutions
Three solutions with different Au concentrations
were prepared, and the procedure was as follows: 0.493 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.521 g of La(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in a mixed
solution consisting of 7 mL of DMF and 3 mL of ethanol followed by
stirring until completely dissolved. Appropriate amounts of HAuCl
solution required to prepare 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt % Au-loaded LaFeO3 were then added into the mixture. Then, 1.5 g of PVP was
added into the solution and continuously stirred to make the homogeneous
gel precursor solution ready for electrospinning. For comparison purposes,
the pure LaFeO3 solution was prepared following the same
procedure without the addition of the HAuCl solution.

2.3 Fabrication of the Pure and Au-Loaded LaFeO3 NBs
For the electrospinning process, each of the
prepared precursor solutions was transferred into a 10 mL glass syringe,
with an inner diameter of 0.6 mm. A voltage of 20 kV was applied between
the spinneret and the rotating drum collector with a spacing distance
of 10 cm. The solution was continuously pumped by a syringe pump at
a rate of 0.8 μL h–1. The obtained NB composites
were annealed at 550 °C for 2 h in air to obtain the Au-loaded
LaFeO3 NBs at a heating rate of 2 °C min–1. For convenience, the unloaded sample was named S1 and Au-loaded
LaFeO3 samples were named S2, S3, and S4 for Au concentrations
of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt %, respectively.

2.4 Characterization
of the Pure and Au-Loaded
LaFeO3 NBs
The phase purity and crystallinity
characteristics of S1–S4 were measured through X-ray diffraction
(XRD) using a computer-controlled Panalytical X’pert PRO PW3040/60
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation.
The morphology and elemental distribution analyses were performed
using a ZEIS-AURIGA field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM)
and JEOL TEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped
with an electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) patterns were recorded on a PHI 5000 Versaprobe
X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with monochromatic
Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The
specific surface areas and pore volumes of the samples were examined
using a Micromeritics TRISTAR 3000 surface area analyzer.

2.5 Fabrication and Measurement of Gas Sensors
Based on Pure and Au-Loaded LaFeO3 NBs
The sensors
based on S1, S2, S3, and S4 were prepared as follows: 40 mg of each
sample was mixed with a solution of ethyl cellulose (a temporary binder)
in turpineol and ground for a few minutes to make thixotropic pastes.
The pastes were then coated onto an alumina substrate equipped with
a pair of platinum (Pt) electrodes on the top surface and a heater
at the bottom surface to control the operating temperature. The sensors
were then heated at 300 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 3 °C
min–1 to achieve good adhesion. The gas-sensing
performance was evaluated using a KSGAS6S gas-sensing station (KENOSISTEC,
Italy). The atmospheric condition was controlled by means of MKS Instruments
Deutschland GmbH mass flow controllers supplying desired concentrations
of NH3, C3H6O, NO2, CO,
and CH4 into the sensing chamber by diluting the concentrated
analyte gas in synthetic air. The operating temperature of the sensors
was controlled by adjusting the heating voltage while using a thermocouple
to measure the output temperature to correspond to temperatures from
the room temperature (RT) to 180 °C. The changes in electrical
resistance during the interaction of the analyte gas molecules and
the surface of the LaFeO3 NB-based sensors was measured
in air (Ra) and in the presence of the
analyte gas (Rg) by means of a Keithley
6487 Picoammeter/voltage source meter. Since the NBs were annealed
at 550 °C, the gas-sensing measurements were below 200 °C;
so no thermally induced changes were expected in the sensing material.
It is also important to mention that S1, S2, S3, and S4 are all p-type
materials whose resistance increase in reducing gas- containing air
and the sensor response can be determined by Rg/Ra.50 The time taken by the sensor to reach 90% of the highest change
in resistance after exposure to the analyte gas was measured as the
response time while the time taken by the sensor to reach 90% of its
original resistance was measured as the recovery time.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Phase and Morphology Analysis
The
phase purity and crystallinity of the obtained samples were determined
using XRD, and the resulting diffraction patterns are shown in Figure 1. The X-ray diffraction
patterns for S1 could be indexed to the LaFeO3 perovskite
phase with orthorhombic structure (JCPDS card no. 75-0541). Upon Au
loading onto LaFeO3 surface, a slight shift in diffraction
peak positions of S2, S3, and S4 as compared with S1 was observed.
Additional diffraction peaks located at 38.1, 44.3, 64.5, and 77.5°
corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes indexed to
the cubic phase of Au (JCPDS card no. 04-0748) were also noted. Further,
the decline in peak intensity upon Au incorporation suggests poor
crystallinity of LaFeO3 caused by the addition of Au. Moreover,
peak broadening was observed with Au incorporation, indicating a decrease
in crystallite size due to the addition of Au. Therefore, the mean
crystallite sizes of S1, S2, S3, and S4 estimated from the Scherrer
equation55 using the (110) plane were found
to be 20.7, 14.2, 15.3, and 25.6 nm, respectively. On the basis of
these findings, it can be realized that the introduction of Au onto
LaFeO3 has an influence on the structural properties of
LaFeO3.

Figure 1 Diffraction patterns of S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively.

Further, the morphological analysis of S1 to S4
was conducted through
the use of SEM and the resulting micrographs of S1 to S4 are shown
in Figure 2. Figure 2a presents the NBs
before annealing, which revealed long nanobelts up to a few microns
and around 3.2 μm in diameter. It was also noticed that the
surface of the NBs was smooth and this is due to the presence of PVP,
which acts as a template, thus assisting in maintaining the NB morphology.57 It is worth mentioning that all as-spun NBs
preserved this NB morphology regardless of the Au-loading level. Thus,
only one image was used to represent the as-spun products. After annealing,
all obtained products (S1–S4) preserved the beltlike morphology;
however, their average diameter was reduced to a range of 300 nm due
to PVP decomposition during thermal annealing. Moreover, it was realized
that the belts became very brittle as some of them were found to break
since they contain a thinner section and also due to internal stress
caused by the belt-structure shrinkage.58,59

of the (a) as-spun, (b) S1, (c) S2, (d) S3, and (e)
S4 NBs, respectively.

Confirmation of the morphology
was further done by high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM), and the obtained images are presented in Figure 3. As observed in Figure 3a, the HRTEM micrograph for
S1 revealed a beltlike structure composed of several single nanoparticles
with an average grain size of ∼20 nm that were joined to each
other to form a belt structure. As for S2, S3, and S4, a similar morphology
to that of S1 was observed, except there were some very small particles
belonging to Au distributed on the surface of each belt. The Au particle
size distribution was estimated by measuring the diameter of the Au
particles, and the plots are presented as insets of each TEM image
per Au loading concentration. It was realized that the Au particle
size grew from 17.5, 19.8, to 30.7 nm with increase in the Au loading
level. Electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed a uniform
distribution of La, Fe, and O in the whole S1 belt, and Au was also
detected for S2, S3, and S4. On the basis of these results, it is
clear that Au has been successfully loaded onto the surface of the
LaFeO3 NBs.

their corresponding
EDS maps (b, d, f, and h). Particle size distribution is represented
as insets of each figure.

3.2 Surface Area and Porosity Analysis
Generally,
the sample’s relative surface area and porosity
are important parameters to determine gas-sensing performance as they
can be favorable to provide active sites and gas diffusion pathways.
Thus, the specific surface areas and the pore size of S1–S4
were determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. Figure 4 displays the nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms of S1, S2, S3, and S4. All
isotherms exhibit a type IV isotherm, suggesting interconnected mesoporosity
and high pore connectivity of the NBs.39,60,61 According to the adsorption–desorption isotherms,
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area values
of S1, S2, S3, and S4 were found to be 5.8, 16.1, 9.1, and 10.9 m2 g–1, respectively. The pore size distribution
was determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
model analysis (see insets of Figure 4). The BJH pore size distribution indicated that S1,
S2, S3, and S4 have an average pore diameter of 10.4, 29.4, 38.9,
and 46.1 nm, respectively. The enhanced surface area and porosity
can be attributed to the absence of clogging of the pores on the surface
of LaFeO3 as the Au nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed
on the surface of each belt. Moreover, due to their very small size,
the Au nanoparticles contribute to the overall surface area and porosity
of the nanocomposites. The high surface area and porous structure
is deemed beneficial in gas sensing as it can increase the sensing
response and recovery speed by aiding the inward diffusion of the
analyte gas or oxygen on the sensing material surface and the counter
diffusion of reactant gases to the immediate ambient surroundings.62

corresponding
pore size distribution curves of (a) S1, (b) S2, (c) S3, and (d) S4.

3.3 Chemical Composition Analysis
The
information regarding the electronic states and surface chemical composition
of the samples was acquired through XPS measurements. In this case,
the pure (i.e., S1) and highly Au-loaded (i.e., S4) samples were selected
for this analysis. Figure 5 presents the recorded high-resolution spectra of La 3d, Fe
2p, Au 4f, and O 1s core levels of S1 and S4. As displayed in Figure 5a,b, the La 3d spectra
acquired from both the S1 and S4 samples revealed two double peaks
representing spin–orbit splitting components of La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2 located at the 835.6 and 852.3 eV, respectively.63 The split distance between the spin–orbit
doublet was ∼16.7 eV, which is indicative of the La3+ state.31,32,64 The La 3d
spectrum from pure La(OH)3, for example, will have four
visible components, as in this case, even though there is only one
chemical state.65

XPS spectra of (a, b) La 3d for S1 and S4,
(c) Fe 2p for S1 and S4, (d) Au 4f for S4, (e, f) O 1s core levels
of the for S1 and S4.

Similarly, the high-resolution
spectrum of the Fe 2p core level
from both the S1 and S4 presented in Figure 5c exhibited the spin–orbit splitting
of the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 core level states
located at 709.9 and 723.5 eV with a spin–orbit splitting of
13.6 eV, which corresponds to the Fe3+ of LaFeO3, respectively.66,67 To gain more insight about the
chemical state of Au loaded onto NB surface, the high-resolution spectrum
of the Au 4f core level was recorded and is shown in Figure 5d. As shown in this figure,
the Au 4f spectrum of the Au-loaded sample displayed a doublet at
85.1 and 88.6 eV for Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively,
which correspond to the A0 state of metallic Au.68 An additional peak belonging to Fe 3s was observed
at a binding energy of 91.6 eV, confirming the interaction between
Au and LaFeO3. The high resolution of O 1s depicted in Figure 5e,f was Gaussian-fitted
into three peaks corresponding to three types of oxygen states at
the surface herein labeled as OL at 528.9 and 530.4 eV,
OV at 531.2 and 531.5 eV, and OC at 532.4 and
532.9 eV for S1 and S4, respectively. OL can be assigned
to O2–, which is related to the bulk lattice oxygen,
while OV can be associated with surface-adsorbed oxygen
(O–) and is related to oxygen vacancies, and OC corresponds to O2–, which is
related to the chemisorbed species such as carbonates and hydroxyls,
respectively.69−71

3.4 Gas-Sensing Performance
of the Pure and Au-Loaded
LaFeO3 NBs
Normally, metal oxide-based gas sensors
require heating to appropriate temperatures to achieve maximum response.
The sensor response is usually defined as Ra/Rg for reducing gases and as Rg/Ra for oxidizing
gases, where Ra is the sensor resistance
in air and Rg is the sensor resistance
in the presence of the target gas.72 So
to determine the operating temperature for S1–S4-based sensors,
acetone responses at a concentration of 40 ppm at RT (23 °C),
100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 °C were measured and the results
are illustrated in Figure 6. An obvious response dependence on the operating temperature
can be observed. With an increase in the operating temperature, the
responses of all sensors were shown to increase to a maximum at 100
°C, then decrease with further increase of temperature toward
140–180 °C. The low responses displayed by all sensors
at low operating temperatures is a common behavior for SMO as the
analyte gas molecules do not have enough thermal energy to interact
with the adsorbed surface oxygen species, thus giving a low response.
But gradual increase of the operating temperature provides the analyte
gas molecules with enough thermal energy to get activated and react
with the surface-adsorbed oxygen species, therefore giving a high
response. However, with further increase to higher temperatures, the
rate of analyte gas adsorption and the usage of the sensing layer
become reduced, resulting in the weakening of the sensor response.51,73 The response values were found to be 112, 102, 125, and 96 for the
sensors based on S1, S2, S3, and S4. From the obtained values, it
can be clearly seen that the Au loading levels have an impact on the
response of the LaFeO3 NBs. The loading concentration determines
the distribution and size of Au nanoparticles on the surface of the
LaFeO3 NBs, which strongly affects the gas-sensing response
owing to the electronic and chemical catalytic stimulation of the
Au nanoparticles, which strongly depend on the Au nanoparticle size
and distribution.74 Thus, it is important
to obtain a suitable amount of Au loading for effective improvement
of acetone response by LaFeO3 NB-based sensors. On the
basis of the above temperature dependence studies and findings, all
acetone measurements on S1, S2, S3, and S4 were carried out at 100
°C.

Figure 6 Responses of the S1-, S2-, S3-, and S4-based sensors to 40 ppm
acetone at different operating temperatures.

To gain more insight on the effect induced by the Au nanoparticles
on the surface of the LaFeO3 NBs; S1–S4-based sensors
were subjected to 2.5–40 ppm of acetone as a function of time
at an operating temperature of 100 °C and the resulting curves
are shown in Figure 7. All sensors displayed an increase and decrease in sensor resistance
upon exposure to acetone and in air, which is typical of p-type SMO
upon exposure to a reducing gas.75 Moreover,
the increase and decrease in resistance upon contact and removal of
the acetone gas demonstrates the reversible interaction between the
sensing material and the analyte gas. This reversible interaction
takes a specific time, i.e., response and recovery time, which is
very important for the practical application of gas sensors for efficiency
and reliability purposes. The response times of the of S1–S4-based
sensors to 40 ppm acetone were determined as 100, 70, 26, and 35 s,
whereas the recovery times were found to be 17, 22, 20, and 9 s for
S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively. Fast response and recovery times
were obtained for S2, S3, and S4, which can be attributed to the better
accessibility of active sites and ease in diffusion due to the porous
structures, coupled with the Au nanoparticle catalytic effect. Generally,
the response of a sensor is dependent on the concentration of the
target gas, and this relation is clearly displayed in Figure 7e for the response to acetone
in the range from 2.5 to 40 ppm. Even though the lowest concentration
experimentally examined was 2.5 ppm, the theoretical limit of detection
(signal-to-noise ratio > 3) was estimated from Figure 7e to be around 0.056, 0.382,
0.267, and 0.733
ppm for S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively. The limit of detection of
less than 1 ppm to acetone with high response validates the promising
use of the Au-loaded LaFeO3 NBs in high-performance sensors
for acetone detection.

(d) S4
and (e) corresponding responses of S1–S4 to acetone concentrations
ranging from 2.5 to 40 ppm.

As much as a sensor can give high response and fast response kinetics,
it is also very crucial for the sensor to be able to selectively detect
the target gas in the midst of other gases since real application
atmospheres consist of a mixture of gases. With that said, the ability
to single out acetone in the presence of other gases, such as CO,
CH4, NO2, and NH3 of S1-, S2-, S3-,
and S4-based sensors at 100 °C was measured by exposing the sensors
to 40 ppm of each test gas. The obtained results are displayed in Figure 8. All sensors demonstrate
outstanding selectivity toward acetone molecules with S3 sensor displaying
the highest response with minor responses toward interfering gases.
The observed high selectivity toward acetone could probably be due
to the fact that acetone is more chemically reactive with the adsorbed
oxygen species at the optimum temperature (100 °C),76,77 whereas the response to the other gas species is rather trivial
probably due to the relative weak chemical interaction between them
and the adsorbed oxygen species on the sensors’ surface. Further,
reproducibility of the sensor response is another important key factor
in practical applications. Therefore, the reproducibility test to
five response/recovery cycles of the sensor based on S3 was conducted
and the results are shown in Figure 8b. The results demonstrated consistent high response
with excellent recovery without any obvious degradation of the sensor
response, indicating good stability and reproducibility.

Figure 8 (a) Gas responses
to 40 ppm of different gases and (b) reproducibility
of S3 to 40 ppm acetone at 100 °C.

Usually, acetone is accompanied by moisture; therefore, it is important
to take into consideration the effect of moisture on the sensing performance
for practical applications. Thus, the comparison of the responses
of S1–S4-based sensors toward 40 ppm of acetone both in dry
and relative humidity (RH) conditions of 30, 70, and 90% at 100 °C
were recorded and are represented by the histogram in Figure 9a. An obvious decline in response
to acetone for both the pure and Au-loaded LaFeO3 was observed
with relative humidity increment from 30 to 90%. The decline of response
with increasing relative humidity is a result of the competition between
the hydroxyl species and the acetone molecules during the surface
reactions, which lowers the oxygen adsorption, therefore reducing
the sensor response.78,79 Interestingly, S3-based sensor
still revealed the highest response in all RH levels whereby it showed
a small drop in response at 30–70% RH and a significant decrease
in its response was observed at a higher relative humidity of 90%
(see Figure 9b). The
good sensing response of S3 even in a wide range of relative humidity
conditions validates the practical applicability of the sensor.

3.5 Acetone Sensing Mechanism
In general,
for SMO gas sensors, the most widely accepted sensing mechanism relies
on the type of material’s majority charge carriers (electrons
or holes), its surface groups (i.e., O2–, O–, O2–), and the nature
of the surface (acidic or basic surface), which mainly determine the
adsorption–desorption interaction between the analyte gas and
the sensing material. LaFeO3 is regarded as a p-type SMO
with the holes being the majority charge carriers while its gas-sensing
mechanism is based on the changes of resistance in air and in the
presence of the analyte gas.

When considering the pure LaFeO3 NBs in air (Figure 9(1a)), neutral oxygen molecules adsorb on the LaFeO3 surface and get partially ionized into O2–, O–, or O2– ions by attracting
electrons from the valence band at different temperatures. Since the
sensors in this work were operated at 100 °C, O2– ions are more dominant than any other oxygen adsorbate.80 Exposure of the LaFeO3 sensors to
the ambient atmosphere then led to the formation of a thick underlying
hole accumulation layer, which allowed the sensor to have a relatively
low resistance layer covering the whole surface of the sensor. On
the other hand, when the LaFeO3-based sensors came into
contact with acetone molecules (see Figure 10(1b)), a reaction between the acetone molecules
and the oxygen adsorbates took place to form CO2 and H2O according to the following relation81 1  This reaction
then led to the release of electrons
to the valence band, resulting in the recombination of electrons and
holes.81 As a result, the concentration
of the holes was decreased and this led to an increase in the resistance
of the LaFeO3-based sensor. In the case of S3 (0.3 wt %
Au-loaded LaFeO3) in Figure 10 (2(a,b)), the acetone sensing mechanism
follows the same process as that on the pure LaFeO3; however,
the electronic and chemical sensitization of the Au nanoparticles
promotes enhancement in the sensing performance of the LaFeO3 NB-based sensor.82 The significant enhancement
in the sensing performance of S3 may be explained as follows:(i) Au is a good catalyst
for oxygen dissociation,83 which means
that Au nanoparticles aid in ease
of oxygen molecule adsorption and the capture of electrons to produce
active oxygen adsorbates (Figure 10(2a)). Further, acetone molecules are ionized to active
radicals by the Au nanoparticles and due to the spill-over effect
of Au, these active radicals spill over the surface of LaFeO3, facilitating the sensing reactions on the surface of LaFeO3, thus enhancing the response and also fast-tracking response
and recovery times.

(ii) The surface area and pore diameter
increased with Au loading, as confirmed from BET analysis, and this
can provide more surface adsorption sites to adsorb oxygen and acetone
molecules and also ease in diffusion, hence the improved gas-sensing
response.

(iii) The 1D
NB morphology of LaFeO3 also plays an important role as
it allows overlapping of
the hole accumulation layers along the NB direction resulting in continuous
hole transfer channels, thus contributing to enhancement of the sensor
performance.



Figure 10 Proposed acetone sensing mechanism of
the (a) pure and (b) Au-loaded
LaFeO3 NBs.

Through literature survey
it was realized that there are some acetone
sensors based on LaFeO3 nanostructures, which display different
sensing capabilities. Table 1 lists some of the literature sampled through systems that
are close to the work reported herein for comparison purposes. In
comparison with the literature, it can be realized that S3 displays
high response to a low concentration of acetone (40 ppm) at a relatively
low operating temperature with quick response and recovery speed,
thus ensuring a low power consuming operation with fast response kinetics.
Moreover, S3 revealed good repeatability to a few response–recovery
cycles, indicating stability and reproducibility, which are critical
characteristics for practical applications. Thus, the S3-based sensor
possesses valuable gas-sensing characteristics that deem it fit for
practical applications.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
a series of 1D Au-loaded LaFeO3 NBs have
been successfully synthesized via the electrospinning technique. The
size and distribution of the Au nanoparticles on the surface of the
LaFeO3 NBs was controlled by adjusting the dosage of HAuCl.
When tested for gas-sensing performance, all Au-loaded LaFeO3 NBs, including the pure LaFeO3 exhibited good selectivity
and high response to acetone at an operating temperature of 100 °C
with the 0.3 wt % Au-loaded LaFeO3 NB-based sensor displaying
the highest response in comparison with the other sensors. The gas-sensing
behavior displayed by this sensor is closely related to the size and
distribution of the Au nanoparticles, which controls the catalytic
activity of the Au catalyst. Moreover, the increased surface area
and porosity induced by Au addition on the 1D NB structure also played
an essential role in the increasing gas-sensing performance of the
S3-based sensor. The Au-doped LaFeO3 sensor with Au content
of 0.3 wt % offers a new strategy to prepare noble metal-modified
LaFeO3 NBs that can be promisingly employed to produce
excellent and reliable gas sensors to low target gas concentrations
at low operating temperatures.
