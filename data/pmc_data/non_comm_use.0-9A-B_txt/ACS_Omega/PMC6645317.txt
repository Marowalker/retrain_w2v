Nitrenium
ion species are examined using computational methods
(DFT, MP2, coupled-cluster, and a composite method, CBS-APNO) with
a particular emphasis on nonaromatic species (i.e., those lacking
an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring in direct conjugation with the
formal nitrenium ion center.) The substitution of the N+ center with alkyl, alkoxy, vinyl, acyl, and sulfonyl, among others,
was evaluated. For these species, three properties are considered.
(1) The stability of the nitrenium ions to unimolecular isomerizations
such as 1,2 alkyl or H shifts; to the extent that the singlet states
could be characterized as discrete minima on the potential energy
surface (PES), (2) the effect of the substituents on singlet–triplet
energy splitting as well as (3) the relative stabilities of the nitrenium
ions as defined by N-hydration enthalpies (RR′N+ + H2O → RR′NOH2+).
Nearly all simple alkyl and di-alkyl nitrenium ion singlet states
are predicted to rearrange without detectable barriers, largely through
1,2 H or alkyl shifts. Methyl and N,N-dimethylnitrenium ion singlet states could be characterized as formal
minima on the PES. However, these species show small or insignificant
barriers to isomerization. Disubstituted nitrenium ions that include
an alkyl group and a conjugating substituent such as alkoxyl, vinyl,
or phenyl show meaningful barriers to isomerization and are thus predicted
to possess nontrivial lifetimes in solution. Alkyl groups substantially
stabilize the singlet state relative to the situation in the parent
nitrenium ion NH2+ to the point where the two
states are nearly degenerate. Other groups that interact with the
nitrenium ion center decrease the ΔEst in the order formoyl < vinyl < phenyl < alkoxy ∼
sulfonyl < cyclopropyl ∼ cyclobutyl. The latter two substituents
interact strongly with the (singlet) nitrenium ion center through
the formation of a nonclassical bonding reminiscent of the bisected
cyclopropylcarbinyl ion case for carbocations. When singlet-state
stability is evaluated in the context of N-hydration enthalpies, it
is found that the ordering is acyl < vinyl < alkoxyl < phenyl
< cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl.

1 Introduction
Nitrenium
ions, which are reactive intermediates characterized
by a di-coordinate positively charged nitrogen, have been the focus
of investigations over several decades.1−5 Experimental studies based upon chemical trapping,2,6−13 laser flash photolysis,14−22 mass spectrometry,23,24 and electrochemistry25,26 have made it clear that arylnitrenium ions (i.e., those with one
or two aromatic rings directly conjugated to the formal nitrenium
ion nitrogen) have sufficient stability that they can survive in solution
long enough to form stable adducts with various external trapping
agents. Recent nitrenium ion investigations have emphasized the arylnitrenium
ions undoubtedly because of the involvement of such species in DNA-damaging
reactions originating from the metabolism of arylamines and aromatic
nitro compounds.8,17,27−33

The current report, however, deals with nonaromatic nitrenium
ions.
It considers aliphatic, alicyclic, acyl, vinyl, and alkoxy substituted
nitrenium ions and evaluates their stabilities toward the unimolecular
decay processes. The specific species considered here are listed,
in rough order of complexity, as structures 1–43 in Chart 1. There
has been recent interest in using highly stabilized nitrenium ions
(analogous to N-heterocyclic carbenes) in catalysis, metal binding,
etc. However, these highly stabilized examples are directly addressed
by this report.34−38 Like carbenium ions, the extant literature on alkylnitrenium ions
generally suggests that these intermediates are susceptible to 1,2-shifts
of hydride or alkyl groups.5,39−44 Indeed, much of the early literature was concerned with determining
whether products from presumed nitrenium ion precursors arise from
bona fide equilibrated nitrenium ion intermediates or from concerted
reactions where a thermally equilibrated nitrenium ion is not formed.4,5,40

Chart 1 Three considerations
motivated this study. First, there is growing
interest in the use of nitrenium ions in synthetic chemistry. For
example, Wardrop45 and others have achieved
useful cyclization reactions via N-acyl-N-alkoxynitrenium ions. More generally, the prospect of using nitrenium
ions in electrophilic substitution reactions remains an attractive
one.46−50 Thus, the predictions of lifetimes and the properties of these species
have the potential to direct experimental efforts toward more productive
directions. Second, numerous biological, environmental, and synthetic
reactions involve the oxidation of amines or reduction of nitro compounds.
Such processes could, at least in principle, proceed via nitrenium
ion intermediates. Improved estimates of nitrenium ion stabilities
can help identify or exclude the involvement of these intermediates
in such processes. Finally, the question of alkylnitrenium ion intermediates
is of considerable historical interest. The late Paul Gassman recognized
that cyclic nitrenium ions such as 14 could share many
of the same properties as the corresponding carbenium ions, including
the possibility of nonclassical structures.40 The nitrenium ions, however, are potentially even more complex because
of the possibility of existing in either a triplet or a singlet state.
At the time it was not known which was the ground state, but qualitative
orbital analysis suggested that the two states would be very close
in energy. Formation of the corresponding amine, along with rearrangement
products, led Gassman and his co-workers to conclude that (a) the
nitrenium ion was formed as a discrete intermediate from heterolysis
of the chloroamine and (b) that this nitrenium ion could convert to
the triplet state competitively with the rearrangement. The triplet
state was thought to be responsible for the formation of the amine,
via sequential H atom abstractions).

The triplet state mechanism
proposed by Gassman was not universally
embraced. Indeed, the formation of amines is exceptional, rather than
typical, in solvolysis of potential alkylnitrenium ion precursors.
Hoffman’s attempt to generate the same nitrenium ion using
a different leaving group generated only rearrangement products.43 On this basis, it was argued that the amine
products observed by Gassman were caused by a homolysis pathway, rather
than by a free nitrenium ion. More recently, an attempt to generate
the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl nitrenium ion 11 produced
rearrangement products but no other products that could be definitively
attributed to the formation of a nitrenium ion (Scheme 1).6

Scheme 1 The decades that followed Gassman’s study have
seen substantial
improvements in theoretical and computational methods to the point
where they are capable of examining the stability and existence of
hypothetical intermediates. In the longstanding question of classical
versus nonclassical bonding in the 2-norbornyl cation,51−54 calculations, which were later confirmed by X-ray crystallography,
confirm delocalized sigma bonding for this intermediate.

There
have been a few previous computational studies on nitrenium
ions that are related to the present work. First, the parent system,
NH2+, has received considerable computational
attention and it is now clear that the triplet state is the ground
state by a substantial amount, having an adiabatic energy gap of 29.9
kcal/mol relative to the closed-shell (n2) singlet.55−60 In contrast to the parent nitrene (NH), the bent structure of NH2+ breaks the degeneracy of the nonbonding orbitals,
resulting in a closed shell singlet state. Indeed, to the extent that
multireference calculations are available,57,58,61 nitrenium ions appear to possess closed
shell singlet states. Gonzales et al.62 demonstrated that the singlet is stabilized relative to the triplet
state when the H atoms are replaced with halogens or CN.

Of
relevance to the rearrangement chemistry discussed below is
a density functional theory (DFT)-based study of methylphenylnitrenium
ion 23, which found a barrier of 19–22 kcal/mol
for a 1,2-hydride shift to form a stable iminium ion.63 This is qualitatively consistent with solution phase experimental
data, which showed that the same nitrenium ion could rearrange competitively
with bimolecular trapping by added nucleophiles.64 DFT methods have been used to study rearrangement processes
in few selected examples of alkylnitrenium ions. For example, Cramer65 found that the three-member aziridenium ion
is stable in the triplet state, but that the singlet state rearranges,
without an apparent barrier, to form a ring-opened dimethyleneiminium
ion. An early ab initio study by Ford and Herman,66 focusing on methyl and dimethylnitrenium ions, found that
the singlet states of these ions rearrange without a detectable barrier
(at the HF/6-31G* level) to form the corresponding iminium ions. The
triplet states, in contrast, showed significant barriers to hydrogen
migration.

The following computations show that the most simple,
free alkylnitrenium
ions possess either no or extremely low barriers to isomerization
in the singlet state. In most cases, including Gassman’s nitrenium
ion, such species are predicted to undergo barrierless 1,2 alkyl or
hydride shifts. The triplets do show significant barriers to isomerization
and could, in principle, live long enough to participate in various
bimolecular reactions. Substitution with even modestly effective pi-conjugating
groups such as carbonyls, vinyl, phenyl, and alkoxy groups stabilizes
the singlet state and the barriers to isomerization are sufficient
to allow these species to participate in bimolecular trapping reactions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Geometries of Nitrenium
Ions
Those
nitrenium ions showing potential energy minima for both the singlet
state and the triplet state are listed in Table 1. As noted in previous studies,3,59,67−72 both singlets and triplets are bent about the R–N–R′
bond angle, with the sp2 singlets preferring bond angles
of ca. 105–115°, absent sterically demanding substituents.
The triplets are more nearly linear with typical bond angles in the
range of 145–155°.

Figure 1 shows the
specific geometries for the singlet and triplet states of dimethyl 3 and vinyl 19 nitrenium ions. Dimethylnitenium
ion singlet 3S has a C–N–C bond angle of
119.8°, indicative of nitrogen having an sp2 hybridized
nonbonding orbital. Indeed, a natural bond order (NBO) analysis provides
a value of sp2.06 for the nonbonding orbital that lies
in the CNC plane. In contrast, the triplet state shows a more obtuse
bond angle of 148.9° and slightly longer C–N bond distances
of 1.40 Å. For this state, the NBO analysis confirms that the
two semioccupied orbitals are relatively unhybridized: the out-of-plane
nonbonding molecular orbital (NBMO) is 99.97% p and the in-plane NBMO is sp5.24 (i.e., ca. 84% p). The
singlet state shows significant hyperconjugative interactions between
the N+ center and the C–H bonds of the methyl groups.
Specifically, the N–C bond distances are 1.37 Å, making
them significantly shorter than the typical C–N single bond
distances of 1.47 Å. Additionally, one of the C–H bonds
on both methyls has an elongated C–H distance of 1.14 Å
(vs typical values of 1.09 Å) and a compressed N–C–H
angle of 93°. These parameters are also consistent with the view
of hyperconjugation stabilizing the singlet state (relative to NH2+).

Figure 1 Equilibrium geometries (M06-2X) for (top) singlet 3S and triplet 3T dimethylnitrenium ion and (bottom)
singlet 19S and triplet 19T vinylnitrenium
ion along
with selected geometric parameters.

The relevant orbitals are depicted in Figure 2, which shows an NBO representation of the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) for both spin states of the dimethylnitrenium ion (3S). Both the HOMO of the singlet and the lower singly occupied
molecular orbital (SOMO) are symmetric with respect to the C–N–C
plane and are largely localized on the nitrogen. The LUMO of the singlet
and the higher energy SOMO are both antisymmetric with respect to
the C–N–C plane. In the case of the triplet, the SOMO
– 2 is consistent with a p-orbital localized mainly on the
nitrogen. However, the singlet LUMO shows significant delocalization
on to the adjacent C–H bonds, consistent with significant hyperconjugative
interactions from the alkyl substituents inferred from the geometries.

Figure 2 NBO representations
of the frontier orbitals for the singlet (3S) and triplet
(3T) dimethylnitrenium ion.

The geometries of the vinylnitrenium ion (19) singlet
and triplet states are shown in detail as Figure 1. For this example, the singlet and triplet
states show similar geometries, aside from the CNH bond angle. Both
states are dominated by an allyl cation-like conjugation of the C=C
group with the N+, as confirmed by C–C bond distances
of 1.42 Å (19S) and 1.40 Å (19T) as well as C–N bond distances of 1.29 Å (19S) and 1.28 Å (19T). The effect of increasing steric
pressure from branched alkyl substituents is to destabilize the singlet
state and shift ΔEst in the direction
of the triplet state. Methyl substitution increases the RNC bond angle
from 112.7° (19S R=H) to 119.3° (20S R=CH3) to 121.6° (21S R=C(CH3)3).

Cyclopropyl (15–17) and cyclobutyl (18) substituents
show interesting nonclassical structures in the singlet
states. The geometry of the exocyclopropylnitrenium 15 ion is shown in Figure 3. This structure features significant shortening of the distal
ring C2–C3 bond (1.38 Å) as well
as that of the C1–N bond. This is accompanied by
lengthening of the proximal C1–C2 and
C1–C3 bonds. In all, this structure is
analogous to the so-called “bisected cyclopropylcarbinyl cation,”73,74 which is one of the fluxional structures observed experimentally
when cyclopropylmethyl cations are generated.75−77 In contrast,
the triplet shows little sigma delocalization, adopting a structure
that shows more modest cyclopropyl bond length distortions of 1.46
Å for the distal C2–C3 bonds and
1.59 Å for the proximal C1–C2,3 bonds.

ion triplet (15T) and singlet
(15S) states along with selected geometric parameters.

The singlet exo-cyclobutylnitrenium
ion also minimizes to a structure
that exhibits nonclassical bonding. In this case, proximal C2–C1 breaks (2.59 Å), accompanied by formation
of what can be characterized as a C1=N double bond
(1.25 Å), along with a two-electron, three-center bond from C4···C3 (1.69 Å) and C4···C2 (1.80 Å). In the meantime, the
distal C3–C2 bond shortens to nearly
standard alkene length (1.39 Å). In contrast, the triplet shows
a more classical structure having ring C–C bond distances of
1.54–1.61 Å (Figures 4).

Figure 4 Exo-cyclobutylnitrenium ion triplet (18T)
and singlet
(18S) states along with the selected geometric parameters.

The acyl substituents, formyl 28 and acetyl 29, also develop a distorted structure
to stabilize their
singlet states. In this case, the carbonyl O moves closer to the N
(1.60 Å), forming an acute O–C–N bond angle of
77°. Indeed, 28S could be regarded as a cyclized
oxaziridinyl cation. In contrast, the triplet state 28T shows a more classical geometry, having an N–O distance of
2.27 Å and an obtuse N–C–O angle of 125.7°
(Figure 5). For the
cases where the remaining N-substituent is methoxy 31S or vinyl 32S, this distortion is not present. The corresponding
N–C–O bond angle for singlet N-formyl-N-vinylnitrenium ion (32S), for example, is
117°, implying that the vinyl group provides sufficient stabilization
and this distortion is avoided. Similar distortions have been seen
for singlet acylnitrenes78 and acylcarbenes.79

Figure 5 Formylnitrenium ion triplet (28T) and singlet
(28S) states along with the selected geometric parameters.

The singlet sulfonylnitrenium
ion 43S shows distortions
analogous to those seen in the acylnitrenium ions. In this case, one
of the O atoms on sulfur bends (96.2° in the triplet to 57.5°
in the singlet) toward the N+ to stabilize the unfilled
p-orbital on N. As shown in Figure 6 the O–N distance decreases from 2.40 Å
in the triplet to 1.54 Å in the singlet. Similar distortions
have been observed for singlet sulfonylnitrenes.80

Figure 6 Sulfonylnitrenium ion triplet (43T) and singlet (43S) states along with the selected geometric parameters.

The allylnitrenium ion 36S also distorts its structure
to avoid forming a true singlet nitrenium ion (Figure 7). In this case, a shallow minimum (Ea = +0.19 kcal/mol) was located, which features
electron donation from the vinylic group into the vacant p orbital
on N. This structure could alternatively be considered as a bisected
2-aziridinyl carbinyl cation. Given the relatively short N+–vinyl bond distance (1.48 Å), it is not clear if this
species should be classified as a true nitrenium ion. This intermediate
is connected by a very small barrier [classically 0.19 kcal/mol, negative
when zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) is considered] to vinylformiminium
ion 36-iso. Both 36 and cyclopropylnitrenium
ion 15 are part of the interesting and complex C3H6N+ potential energy surface (PES)
which is described in detail elsewhere.69

2.2 Singlet–Triplet Energy Gaps
Table 2 lists the
singlet–triplet energy gaps for those nitrenium ions having
singlet states computed using M06-2X, M06-2X-SMD, and, for selected
examples, using the composite CBS-APNO method. As seen in previous
experiments and calculations, the parent system 1 is
a triplet ground state with a singlet–triplet energy gap of
ca. 30 kcal/mol. The present calculations are in accord with the earlier
finding.

Intuitively, alkyl
substitution should have two competing effects
on ΔEst. First, hyperconjugation
(i.e., interaction of filled C–C or C–H sigma orbitals
with the nominally unfilled p orbital on the N+ center)
should increase the energy splitting of the NBMOs on the nitrenium
ion, favoring the singlet state. On the other hand, steric pressures
ought to force wider N–C–R bond angles, which would
favor the triplet. Obviously, the latter effect would be most apparent
with alpha-branched alkyl groups (e.g., tert-butyl) and in the cases
of disubstituted (secondary) nitrenium ions. Conversely, monosubstitution
with primary alkyl or methyl groups is expected to minimize the triplet-favoring
steric effect while maintaining at least some measure of hyperconjugative
stabilization of the singlet state.

The calculations shown in Table 2 indicated that the
electronic effect is dominant,
and that steric effects also play a smaller, but not insignificant
role. Dimethylnitrenium ion 3, like the parent system
NH2+, is predicted to have a triplet ground
state in the gas phase. However, unlike the substantial 29.5 kcal/mol
energy gap seen for NH2+, the gap for 3 diminishes by ca. 28 kcal/mol toward the singlet state.
Indeed, the subtler effects of aqueous solvation are sufficient to
invert the state ordering for the dimethyl species, making it a singlet,
albeit with a very small energy gap. The monomethylnitrenium singlet
state 2S could only be characterized in an aqueous solvent.
However, its gap of −6.7 kcal/mol compared with −3.1
kcal/mol for the dimethyl 3 is consistent with the intuitive
expectations. Monosubstitution allows for electronic stabilization
of the singlet, while minimizing its destabilization through steric
pressures.

Unfortunately, simple mono- or disubstituted alkyl
nitrenium ions
with higher degrees of branching could not be characterized. However,
it was possible to examine the effects of alkyl branching in disubstituted
nitrenium ions where the remaining substituent provided some stabilization
through π-conjugation. Specifically, the effects of H, CH3, and t-butyl substitution were examined
in the cases where the remaining substituent was a vinyl, phenyl,
methoxy, or cyclopropyl group 15–17, 19–27. These calculations are also in accord with the picture of competing
electronic and steric effects.

For the phenyl, vinyl, and cyclopropyl
groups, the differential
effect of N-alkyl substitution is primarily steric. Thus, methyl and
tert-butyl increasingly favor the triplet state relative to the H
analogue. In the case of a relatively small vinyl group, the effect
is modest; the change of ΔEst is
ca. 3 kcal/mol through the series 19–21. With
the larger cyclopropyl 15–17 and phenyl groups 22–24, the change in more dramatic. The tert-butyl
group shifts ΔEst ca. 11 kcal/mol
toward the triplet in the phenyl series (24) and ca.
9 kcal/mol in the cyclopropyl series (17).

The
smaller methoxy group imposes less steric pressure on the N+ center (25–27). As a result, the methyl
group is able to slightly (ca. 3 kcal/mol) favor the singlet state
relative to the H analogue, whereas with tert-butyl the steric effects
slightly outweigh the electronic stabilization and the gap shifts
back by about 1 kcal/mol toward the triplet relative to the H analogue.

Most of the nonalkyl substituents examined in this study, including
acyl, vinyl, phenyl, methoxy 25, cyclpropyl 15, and cyclobutyl 18, similarly stabilize the singlet
state relative to the parent system. Aromatic groups have been examined
extensively elsewhere using slightly different methods. The examples
included here (22–24) are provided for comparison
purposes. The ΔEst values and geometries
for the aromatic series from M06-2X agree with previous reports with
only some minor, quantitative differences. A single phenyl ring 22 stabilizes the singlet state through positive charge delocalization
and the gap calculated in this study is −19.8 kcal/mol.

The vinyl group would be expected to behave in a qualitatively
similar way. The singlet should be stabilized by charge delocalization
through the pi system. Interestingly, the effect is much more modest
compared with the effects of phenyl substitution, with a vinyl group
generating a ΔEst of only −5.7
kcal/mol compared with −19.5 kcal/mol for phenyl 22.

Alkoxyl groups, being strong pi-electron donors, are expected
to
substantially stabilize the singlet state, and the M06-2X calculations
support this intuitive expectation. The methoxynitrenium 25 ion has a ΔEst of −27 kcal/mol,
indicating that this substituent is more effective than a simple phenyl
ring in terms of favoring the singlet state.

Unexpectedly, cyclopropyl 15 and cyclobutyl groups 18 have an even more
substantial effect on ΔEst. These
substituents provide ΔEst values
of <−30 kcal/mol. This is
attributed to the ability of the singlet states to form the nonclassical
(sigma-delocalized) bonding with the small ring substituents (Figures 3 and 4). Similar effects occur in the analogous carbocations. The
bicyclobutonium ion is a textbook example of the so-called “banana
bonds” in the cyclopropyl ring, delocalizing a positive charge
as effectively as, or more than, a pi bond. The corresponding triplet
states are unable to form these types of bonds and show structures
similar to classically bonded triplets.

Sulfonyl 43 and acyl 28, 29 substituents are, in most
contexts, considered to be electron-withdrawing
groups. However, in the case of the nitrenium ions, these substituents
provide ΔEst values that favor the
singlet state. The formyl substituent 28 has an effect
that is comparable to a methyl group with ΔEst = −2.9 kcal/mol. An acetyl shows a larger effect
with ΔEst = −10 kcal/mol,
exceeding the stabilization afforded by a vinyl group and sulfonyl
ΔEst = −30 kcal/mol, far
exceeding the effect of a phenyl or methoxy substituent. As with the
cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl groups, singlet stabilization in these
cases can be traced to unusual bonding available to the singlet but
not triplet states. For these three examples, the N+–X–O
bonds are highly acute and the N+–O distances are
small. Thus, the formylnitrenium ion can be plausibly described as
an oxaziridinyl cation. Or alternatively, filled–unfilled interactions
from the formal O lone pair with the singlet N-based LUMO stabilizes
the singlet relative to the triplet state.

Aqueous solvation
has a modest, but largely consistent, effect
on ΔEst. In most examples, solvation
favors the singlet by 1–4 kcal/mol.

2.3 Relative
N-Hydration Affinities
In
order to assess the ability of various substituents to stabilize singlet
nitrenium ions, the enthalpies for series of isodesmic hydration reactions
were computed. Specifically, we compared the enthalpies for H2O transfer from NH2OH2+ to
the nitrogen centers of the singlet nitrenium ions listed in Table 3 using the M06-2X-SMD
model with the aqueous solvation parameters. The latter provides the
relative enthalpies as defined in eq 1. The absolute N-hydration enthalpy
changes were then computed for the parent system, NH2+, using the composite model chemistry method CBS-APNO/SMD,
CBS-APNO, a basis set extrapolation procedure that is designed to
give a highly accurate thermochemistry. The latter provides a value
of ΔHhyd = −76.51 kcal/mol.

2.4 Barriers to Rearrangements
Singlet
alkylnitrenium ions are isomeric with iminium ions derived from a
1,2 alkyl or H shift from the N-alkyl group to N+. Because
the iminium ion is significantly more stable, it could be anticipated
that the rearrangement step will be very fast. In fact, historically
speaking, there had been considerable debate as to whether free singlet
nitrenium ions could exist as discrete intermediates, or if the formation
of the iminium ions would be concerted with their formation.

Relatively few simple alkylnitrenium ions could be characterized
as minima on the singlet PES. Therefore, we investigated the barriers
associated with 1,2 alkyl and H atom migration for those nitrenium
ions that could be characterized as singlets. These include the dimethylnitrenium
ion 3, the methylnitrenium ion 2 in aqueous
solution, and several other nitrenium ions where the remaining substituent
was capable of stabilizing the singlet state through resonance electron
donation.

All of the alkylnitrenium ions examined here show
low barriers
to isomerization via 1,2-alkyl or H shifts to the N+ center.
Transition states for the unstabilized monomethyl 2 and
dimethylnitrenium ions 3 are very low. In the case of
monomethyl 2, no minimum could be located in the gas
phase, and there was a small 7.2 kcal/mol barrier in the aqueous solution.
Dimethyl 3 has even lower barriers, 0.11 and 0.04 kcal/mol,
respectively, in the gas phase and aqueous solution. These formal
barriers are unlikely to have any experimental relevance. Attempts
to explore these rearrangements with higher homologues (ethyl, isopropyl,
etc.) were unsuccessful as it was not possible to locate singlet nitrenium
ion minima (see below).

It was, however, possible to examine
the effects of increasing
alkyl branching on isomerization barriers in the cases where the remaining
N-substituent stabilized the singlet state via resonance interaction.
Specifically, methyl and tert-butyl groups were each combined with
methoxy and vinyl N-substituents (entries 3 and 4 for vinyl as well
as entries 5 and 6 for methoxy). In both cases, the barrier for alkyl
migration (tert-butyl groups) is substantially smaller than the comparable
barrier for H atom migration (from the methyl groups) (Table 4). Thus, it is reasonable to
infer that in the mono- and dialkyl cases, alkyl migrations would
have smaller barriers than seen in the mono- or dimethylnitrenium
ions. As the barriers in the methyl cases are very small to begin
with, larger alkyl groups would be expected to show rearrangements
without barriers or with trivial barriers.

2.5 Nitrenium Ions Showing No Local Minima as
Singlets
Table 5 shows schematic representations of input and optimized geometries
for 23 simple alkyl, dialkyl, cycloalkyl, and acyl alkyl nitrenium
ions. None of these examples converged to local minima at the starting
nitrenium ion-like geometries. Structures were minimized at the M06-2X
level, and using the triplet geometries, at the SMD-M06-2X and MP2
levels as well. Except where noted, each of these optimizations converged
on the same structures, which were verified as local minima through
vibrational frequency analysis of the reported structure. Similarly,
unless otherwise stated, each of these examples did converge to a
triplet minimum near the input geometry.

Table 5 Schematic
Depiction of Nitrenium Ions
That Do Not Show Discrete Singlet Minima (M06-2X) and Their Converged
Structures
In most cases,
the singlet minima are structures that involve 1,2
alkyl or H atom shifts from the alkyl substituent to the nitrenium
ion center, creating iminium ion structures. Notably, Gassman’s
nitrenium ion 14 minimizes directly to the same alkyl
shift isomer that was experimentally trapped by nucleophiles. Similarly,
the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl nitrenium ion 11 minimized
to the methyl shift isomer, consistent with experimental reports.6

For the aziridinyl nitrenium ion 8, the minimized
structure involves ring-opening to form a bis-methyleneiminium ion, 8S-iso. This confirms earlier calculations that had used different
methodologies.65 An early experimental
study by Gassman et al.81 found that solvolysis
of N-chloroaziridines produced products consistent
with the concerted formation of 8S-iso (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 A few examples resulted
in net elimination reactions. For example,
methylacetylnitrenium ion 30 minimizes to an acetylcation/formimine
molecular complex. Methyl- (2) and ethyl- (3) nitrenium ions minimized to molecular complexes of H2 and the conjugated acids of HCN or CH3CN. The endo-succinimidylnitrenium ion 35 is similarly
predicted to eliminate ethylene to form an interesting heterocummulene
cation OCNCO+, which has been characterized by mass spectrometry
and X-ray crystallography.82,83

In contrast,
optimization of these same species as triplets readily
converged on local minima with characteristic nitrenium ion structures.
The one exception to this was the triplet state of the 1-pent-4-enylnitrenium
ion (38). The corresponding singlet cyclizes through
a formal insertion of the N+ into the proximal vinylic
C–H bond. Interestingly, the triplet also minimizes to a diradical
structure wherein the N+ adds to the vinylic group in a
5-endo-trig fashion.

2.6 Concerted Dehydration/Rearrangement
Although these geometry optimizations provide a fairly consistent
picture of unstable singlet states for alkylnitrenium ions, one should
be cautious about overinterpreting the results. First, while the algorithm
employed in the optimizations has proven to be extremely robust and
reliable at locating minima, it does not explore the entirety of the
phase space. Thus, there is always a possibility, if a remote one,
that some unlocated minimum exists for a given singlet nitrenium ion.
Second, the geometry minimization procedures are not the same as a
molecular dynamics simulation. Thus, the singlet minima reported in Table 5 do not necessarily
reflect products that would result from attempted formation of the
corresponding singlet nitrenium ion under chemically realistic conditions.
The latter would generally be formed through some sort of adiabatic
bond heterolysis and/or oxidation process, rather than being instantaneously
born at some arbitrary geometry. In those cases, the pathway that
is followed would presumably be dependent on the nature of the leaving
group or oxidizing species.

A comprehensive study of all possible
oxidation and heterolysis processes that could make nitrenium ions
was deemed beyond the scope of this study. However, in order to identify
the possible products from such pathways, one such process was considered.
Specifically, the heterolysis of O-protonated hydroxylamines was examined
(Figure 8). In these
computations, the structures of the O-protonated conjugate acids for N-methylhydroxylamine, N-tert-butylhydroxylamine, and the corresponding derivative of Gassman’s
nitrenium ion 14 were minimized at the M06-2X-SMD level
using aqueous solvation. For each of these structures, the N–O
bond length was held constant at increasing increments of 0.04 Å
from its equilibrium value, whereas all other geometric parameters
were allowed to relax at each increment. In each case, this heterolysis
scan resulted in a product where the corresponding alkyl group or
H atom migrated in concert with the loss of the water molecule. The
results of these scans provided starting geometries, which could be
then optimized to the transition states for the corresponding heterolysis
reaction as well as product complexes where the water was bound to
the product.

Figure 8 Concerted dehydration/rearrangement for O-protonated hydroxylamines.

Shown in Figures 9–11 are reactants,
products, and transition states for the dehydration reactions for
the N–H2O adducts of methylnitrenium ion 2, tert-butylnitrenium ion 5, and Gassmans’
nitrenium ion 14. In each case, the transition state
features significant movement of the beta alkyl or H atom. Of particular
interest is the case of the methynitrenium ion. As shown in Table 5, this structure optimizes
to H2 and HCN–H+ when the singlet is
modeled in the gas phase. However, the predicted product under heterolysis
conditions is the iminium ion resulting from the 1,2-shift, rather
than the H2 elimination product. As might be expected,
the more substituted alkyl group in 5-OH2+ follows a similar
concerted dehydration/alkyl migration pathway. However, in this case,
the barrier is a bit lower and the overall driving force is larger,
presumably due to relief of steric strains in the reactants and stabilization
of the C=N bond in the product through alkyl substitution.

points in the singlet state dehydration of CH3NHOH2+ (3OH2+) illustrating loss of water concerted
with H migration.

Figure 10 Stationary points in
the singlet state dehydration of tBuNHOH2+ (6OH2+) illustrating loss of water concerted
with CH3 migration.

Figure 11 Stationary points with selected geometric parameters from the concerted
dissociation/rearrangement of 33-OH2+. A single transition state connects
the protonated hydroxamic acid 33-OH2 to the ring-contracted product.

The endocyclic acylnitrenium ions (derived from lactams) 33 and 34 minimize to interesting ring-opened
structures in their triplet states. The singlet states minimize to
highly strained, protonated, unsaturated lactams. In contrast, Lesard
et al.48,84,85 demonstrated
alkyl migrations resulting in synthetically useful ring contractions
of N-chlorolactams and related derivatives (i.e.,
potential nitrenium ion precursors). An example of these is provided
in Scheme 3. Development
of the positive charge on the nitrogen results in the migration of
either the carbonyl-adjacent group (C3) to the nitrogen, providing
a carbonyliminium ion, or the migration of the carbon one atom removed
from the nitrogen (C5) to the latter, forming an alkylidene iminium
ion.

Scheme 3 To resolve this apparent discrepancy, heterolyses of two
lactam-derived
nitrenium ions, 33-OH2+ and 34-OH2+ were examined (Scheme 4). In both cases, low energy transition states
leading to ring contraction products were located. Interestingly, 33-OH2+ dissociates
with concerted formation of the ring-contracted carboxylic acid, whereas
the larger 34-OH2+ dissociates to form the corresponding hydroxymethyl derivative
(Figure 12). Although
this study did not consider specific species and leaving groups examined
in the earlier report, it does provide a picture that is broadly consistent
with these experimental findings. Alkyl migration, rather than H migration,
is preferred.

Figure 12 Stationary points in the dissociation/recombination of 34-iso-OH2. A single transition state
connects the
protonated hydroxamic acid 34-OH2 to the ring-contracted product.

Scheme 4 Also examined was Gassman’s bicyclic nitrenium
ion 14 (Figure 13). As described above, attempts to characterize the isolated
singlet
state of this species result in collapse to the 1,2-alkyl shift product
(14-iso). Because of the historic interest in 14, calculations on its formation via heterolysis were carried out
in order to determine if some intermediate might form, which would
allow for the proposed intersystem crossing to 14T. Results
from the N–OH2 bond scan and minimization process,
summarized in Figure 11, show that this is not the case. The N-hydrate undergoes a very
low barrier (3.3 kcal/mol) rearrangement to an isomer where the 1,2-alkyl
shift occurs concertedly with the migration of the H2O
to the neighboring carbon. Attempts to locate a minimum analogous
to the H-bonded complexes seen in the case of 2 and 5 were unsuccessful. Minimizations starting at these approximate
geometries converged on 14-iso-H2O. A similar study on 13-H2O, a derivative of the Gassman nitrenium ion,
lacking the methyl groups, provided similar results. The barrier for
this example was calculated to be 5.8 kcal/mol.

Figure 13 Stationary points from
the concerted heterolytic dissociation and
alkyl migration of Gassman’s nitrenium ion 14-OH2+.

This computational finding is consistent with earlier
experimental
results of Hoffman et al.43 as well as
Gassman and Hartman,86 both of whom found
that attempts to generate 14S (using arylsulfonate leaving
groups, rather than water as modeled here) resulted in direct formation
of rearrangement products analogous to 14-isoOH2+. Apparently, the formation
of the anti-Bredt iminium ion 14-iso from complete dissociation
of the leaving group (H2O, in the present study) is unfavorable,
and a concerted migration of the leaving group to the neighboring
carbon is preferred.

3 Conclusions
The
calculations described here, along with earlier experimental
studies, consistently indicate that simple aliphatic or endoalicyclic
nitrenium ions are not stable and should rearrange without a barrier
in the singlet state. In the two cases (2S and 3S) that do show formal minima, the small barriers to rearrangement
are not likely to have any chemical significance. Although the triplets
are kinetically stable, the projected singlet–triplet energy
gaps either favor the singlet or are small enough that facile intersystem
crossing is likely to defeat any attempt at isolating or detecting
the triplets. Absent compelling evidence to the contrary, detection
of apparent nitrenium ion products from alkylamine oxidation should
be attributed to concerted processes. Exceptions to this generalization
are the cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl substituted cases. These form interesting
structures having nonclassical σ-bonding, similar to the corresponding
carbenium ions.

The situation changes when even modestly effective
π-donating
substituents are attached to the nitrenium ion center. Vinyl, aryl,
alkoxy, cyclobutyl, and cyclopropyl groups all stabilize the singlet
state and create barriers to rearrangement when the remaining substituent
is an alkyl group. This stabilization is also seen in increasing N-hydration
enthalpies (Table 3) and ΔEst values that increasingly
favor the singlet state (Table 4). In those cases, formation along with detection and/or chemical
trapping of a discrete nitrenium ion species should be possible, albeit
technically challenging. Acyl substituents have a very modest stabilizing
effect on the singlet state as measured by the calculated N-hydration
enthalpies and ΔEst, but are not
sufficiently stabilizing to inhibit migration processes in cases where
the remaining substituent is an alkyl group. The relatively simple
substitutions considered here are expected to result in singlet ground
states where ΔEst decreases in the
order alkyl ∼ acyl < vinyl < phenyl < alkoxy ∼
sulfonyl < cyclopropyl ∼ cyclobutyl. Simple arylnitrenium
ions are also expected to be ground-state singlets. However, it has
been shown that with complex substitution patterns (e.g., meta donors
or antiaromatic systems), certain arylnitrenium ions can become ground-state
triplets.87−89 Thus, future studies will be directed at identifying
situations where the non-aryl substituents studied here might result
in unusual electronic properties.

4 Computational
Methods
Geometries of singlet- and triplet-state nitrenium
ions and related
species described herein were optimized using varying levels of theory
such as the hybrid density functional M06-2X90 using the 6-311G(d,p)91 basis set for
gas phase calculation, abbreviated below as M06-2X. This combination
of functional and basis set was chosen because, in cases where comparisons
could be made, it gave reasonable agreement with more accurate composite
methods (e.g., CBS-APNO), but at a significantly lower cost and could
thus be applied to larger species. M06-2X-SMD refers to the same calculations
carried out using the implicit continuum solvation model “SMD”
developed by Truhlar and co-workers.92 Unless
otherwise noted, such calculations were carried out using the parameters
for aqueous solvation. MP2 refers to second-order Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory. Where possible, more accurate calculations were
carried out using a basis set extrapolation method CBS-APNO,93 which has been shown to provide excellent thermochemical
data for cationic intermediates.94 Singlet–triplet
energy splittings (ΔEst) are adiabatic
values that include unscaled ZPVE corrections for both the singlet
and triplet states. All the reported calculations were done using
the Gaussian 09 software package.95 Analysis
of orbitals and their hybridization was obtained using the NBO method
of Weinhold.96

The nitrenium ions
considered in this study are shown in Chart 1. For each numbered
structure, X, X-S refers to the nitrenium
ion singlet state, X-T refers to the nitrenium ion’s
triplet state, X-isoN refers
to the isomers of the nitrenium ion (generally, these result from
1,2 alkyl shifts). The subscript N provides for situations
where more than one isomer can be formed. X-OH2+ refers to the N-hydration
adduct (i.e., O-protonated N-hydroxylamine analogue).
