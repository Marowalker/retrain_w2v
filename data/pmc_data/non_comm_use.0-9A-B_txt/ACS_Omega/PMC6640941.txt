Electrochemical reduction
of carbon dioxide (CO2) to
formate is energetically inefficient because a high overpotential
(>1.0 V) is required for most traditional catalysts. In this work,
Bi2O2CO3 (BOC) nanosheets were synthesized
as electrocatalysts of CO2 reduction for the first time.
Additionally, BOC decorated on the glassy carbon electrode was reduced
in situ to metal Bi (RB) for comparing the catalytic performance toward
CO2 reduction to that of BOC. The maximum faradaic efficiency
of BOC was 83% at an overpotential of 0.59 V, which is a little lower
than that of RB (90% obtained at the overpotential of 0.99 V). However,
the overpotential for the reduction of CO2 to formate on
BOC is obviously decreased compared to that on RB. After 27 h of electrolysis,
approximately 80% formate selectivity was obtained using the BOC catalyst.
According to the experimental results and the related literature,
a new mechanism for the CO2 reduction reaction on BOC was
proposed, which may play a guiding role in future catalyst design.

1 Introduction
The abundant use of fossil
fuels has accelerated the depletion
of these nonrenewable resources and has led to excessive emission
of carbon dioxide (CO2).1 Converting
CO2 into fuels and useful industrial chemicals using solar
and/or wind energy sources is an ideal solution for reducing CO2 emissions.2−6Figure 1 shows the
evolution of publications on electrochemical reduction of CO2 since the year 1980 (sources: Web of science, Thomson Reuters).
Over the past few years, especially starting from the year of 2009,
research on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 has received
much attention.

Figure 1 Number of publications dedicated to research on electrochemical
reduction of CO2 since the year 1980.

In aqueous solution, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
competes
with the CO2 reduction reaction on the cathode.7,8 Researchers have found that Sn, In, and Pb electrodes, which possess
high hydrogen overpotentials, are passivated for the HER but are active
for the CO2 reduction reaction. Additionally, a faradaic
efficiency (FE) higher than 80% can be easily obtained under optimum
electrolysis conditions for these metal electrodes.9,10 The
CO2 reduction process has largely been stymied by an impractically
high overpotential (>1.0 V), which is necessary to drive the process
on traditional catalysts (including metal plates, nanosized metal
particles, and carbon-supported metal catalysts).11−17 Developing highly active catalysts for the reduction of CO2 to formate at a low overpotential is thus the main challenge.

The overpotential for the conversion of CO2 into fuels
should decrease upon stabilizing the intermediate. Rosen et al. reported
that 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate in the electrolyte
can form a complex with CO2•–,
which can decrease the overpotential for the reduction of CO2 to CO by lowering the free energy of formation of the CO2•– intermediate.18 For the CO2 reduction reaction, it is commonly accepted
that CO2 obtains an electron on the electrode and forms
the intermediate CO2•–.19,20 Recently, Baruch et al. reported that the mechanism for the reduction
of CO2 to formate on Sn and In electrodes involves insertion
of CO2 at the electrode interface to form an electroactive
surface-bound carbonate species, which is the first step in CO2 conversion. They confirmed that carbonate is the intermediate
for the reduction of CO2 to formate on Sn and In electrodes
using in situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy.21,22 These reports inspired us to design a catalyst containing a bonding
carbonate (a possible intermediate for formate production), which
may facilitate the CO2 reduction reaction. Herein, we synthesized
Bi2O2CO3 (BOC) nanosheets as electrocatalysts
for CO2 reduction. Additionally, it is reported that nano-Bi
metal catalysts can catalyze the reduction of CO2 to formate
with a high FE (92%) and good stability and can be obtained by the
reduction of oxides of metal Bi.23 Therefore,
BOC decorated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was reduced to metal
Bi (RB), and a comparison of the performances of BOC and RB for CO2 reduction was given.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 2a–c
gives the morphologies of the prepared BOC. BOC shows a ruleless two-dimensional
thin-sheet-like morphology and has a thickness ranging from 20 to
40 nm. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
image of BOC shows that the lattice spacing of 0.72 nm corresponds
to the 110 crystallographic plane of BOC (see the inset of Figure 2c). The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the BOC sample is shown in Figure 2d, which is well indexed to the standard
card of BOC (PDF No. 25-1464). No peaks of any other impurities were
observed, indicating a high purity of the BOC sample.

Zhang et al. reported that nanosized Bi showed excellent
performance
for CO2 reduction, and it was obtained from the electrochemical
reduction of the metal oxide BiOCl.23 In
this article, the same method was used to reduce BOC to metal Bi (named
RB) for making a comparison between the catalytic performances of
BOC and RB.

Figure 3a shows
the current–time curve during the electrochemical reduction
of BOC at −1.5 V for 1 h. After the reduction process, the
white BOC turned into black RB. The surface states of the BOC and
RB catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Figure 3b shows
the high-resolution XPS spectra recorded for the Bi 4f region of BOC
and RB. The valence state of Bi on the BOC catalyst surface is all
Bi3+. The Bi 4f7/2 spectra recorded for RB can
fit to two components at 158.9 and 157.1 eV, which correspond to Bi3+ and Bi0, respectively.24 The peak area percentages of Bi3+ and Bi0 are
92.3 and 7.7%, respectively. Through analysis of the XPS results,
it can be realized that the main active substance of the surface of
RB is BiOx. Two possible reasons can explain
the existence of Bi3+ on the surface of RB, which was obtained
by the electrochemical reduction of BOC. First, because metal Bi is
readily oxidized in air,25 BiOx may form quickly when RB modified on the GCE is
exposed to air. Second, BOC is not fully reduced during the electrochemical
process, which can be speculated by the reports that a metastable
oxide layer presented on the surface of the Sn cathode even under
reducing potentials.22,26Figure 3c shows the morphology of RB. Compared with
the BOC nanosheets in Figure 2a,b, the RB nanosheets have a similar thickness and adhered
together, which is mainly due to the Nafion being mixed with RB on
GCE. With the help of Nafion, the catalysts modified on the GCEs can
remain stable during the electrolysis process. As shown in Figure 3d, the electrochemically
active surface area (ECSA) of RB is around 2.5-fold that of BOC.

The electrolysis experiments were
performed on BOC- and RB-modified
GCEs, applying a constant potential in the range from −1.1
to −1.6 V. As shown by the FE for producing formate in Figure 4a, the FE of BOC
reaches a maximum of 83% at −1.2 V. As has been mentioned,
a low overpotential for the reaction of CO2 reduction is
desired for practical applications.27−29 The overpotential (η)
can be calculated by the equation 1  where E° is the standard
electrode potential for the reduction of CO2 to HCOO– (E° = −0.41 V vs that
of the standard hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0).30 In this work, the pH value of the electrolyte saturated
with CO2 was 6.98, which is very close to 7.0. The electrolysis
potential of −1.2 V used in our experiments corresponds to
the overpotential of 0.59 V. This result indicates that BOC is a very
active catalyst for CO2 reduction at a low overpotential.
At more negative potentials, BOC has a lower FE than that of RB (Figure 4a). This is because
BOC begins to be reduced at potentials lower than −1.2 V, which
can be explained by the white BOC becoming black after electrolysis
at potentials lower than −1.2 V. Because RB was formed by the
reduction of BOC at −1.5 V, the FE for producing formate on
BOC should be close to that for RB at this potential. It is surprising
that the FE on BOC is much lower than that on RB at −1.5 V.
Two reasons may explain this abnormal phenomenon. First, the total
charge passed was 10 C during the electrolysis process. For the BOC-modified
GCE, more than 0.77 C (calculated by Faraday’s law) was consumed
by the reaction of Bi3+ reduction (Bi3+ + 3e– = Bi); this reaction may lead to a loss of ∼7.7%
of the selectivity for formate production. Second, the RB-modified
GCE has a different surface state compared to that of the BOC-modified
GCE at −1.5 V. From the XPS analysis result (Figure 3b), we know that
the main active substance on the surface of RB is BiOx, and we believe that the amount of Bi0 on the surface of the BOC-modified GCE during electrolysis at −1.5
V is higher than that on the surface of the RB-modified GCE because
the BOC-modified GCE is immersed in the solution at all times, without
being oxidized during the electrolysis process. In our previous work,
we found that the metal Bi plate shows a low selectivity for formate
production at −1.5 V.31 Besides,
when the BOC-modified GCE was reused for electrolysis at −1.5
V for the second time after it was exposed to air for ∼0.5
h, the FE was raised remarkably and reached up to 80%. Thus, we think
that the different surface state is another reason for the low selectivity
of BOC for formate production at −1.5 V.

Figure 4b
illustrates
the LSV curves of the BOC- and RB-modified GCEs in N2-
or CO2-saturated 0.1 mol L–1 KHCO3 solutions. For investigating the actual electrochemical behavior
of BOC, the scanning potential is in the range of −0.6 to −1.2
V because BOC is reduced in situ to black RB when the potential is
more negative than −1.2 V. As we know, the HER is a competitive
reaction during the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in
an aqueous solution. As shown in Figure 4b, an obvious increase in the current densities
can be observed at the cathodic end of the voltammograms under both
N2 and CO2. Under N2, this increase
is mainly caused by the HER; under CO2, the enhanced current
must be caused by both the CO2 reduction reaction and the
HER. At a potential of −1.2 V, for BOC, the current density
under CO2 is significantly higher than that under N2; for RB, the current density under CO2 is only
a little higher than that under N2. This indicates that
the CO2 reduction reaction is more likely to occur on the
BOC-modified GCE compared with the RB-modified GCE. On comparing the
ECSA results of the two electrodes (Figure 3d), we found that the catalytic performances
of the two electrodes are not due to their ECSAs. The Tafel plots
for formate production on the BOC- and RB-modified GCEs were investigated,
which are shown in Figure 4c. The resulting Tafel slope of BOC is only 85 mV decade–1, which is much smaller than that of RB. The smaller
Tafel slope of BOC is very advantageous for practical applications
because it helps lower the rate-limiting activation energy barrier
and hence remarkably increases the catalytic activity.3 Continuous CO2 reduction was performed at −1.2
V for 27 h to probe the durability of the BOC-modified GCE, and the
result is shown in Figure 4d. The current does not obviously decay, and the FE for producing
formate is always higher than 80% during the long test period. These
observations indicate the favorable stability of the BOC-modified
GCE. These results show that BOC is an ideal electrocatalyst for the
reduction of CO2 to formate with a high catalytic activity
and stability.

As we known, a lower overpotential for the CO2 reduction
reaction is desired in practical application. As shown in Table 1, the overpotentials
for the reduction of CO2 to formate are higher than 1.0
V for most reported catalysts. Recently, some researchers reported
some important results for the reduction of CO2 to formate
with low overpotentials. Among them, Min and Kanan reported that Pd
nanoparticles dispersed on a carbon support can catalyze the reduction
of CO2 to formate with a high FE (even up to 99%) at an
overpotential of less than 0.20 V, whereas Pd catalysts can deactivate
due to the formation of CO, which poisons formate synthesis at a low
overpotential.30 Gao et al. reported that
a partially oxidized four-atom-thick Co layer can catalyze the reduction
of CO2 to formate with a FE of 90% at an overpotential
of 0.24 V; the excellent performance heavily depends on the ultrathin
(0.84 nm) and partially oxidized Co layer structure.34 In this work, the overpotentials of the RB and BOC catalysts
are 0.99 and 0.59 V, respectively, which are lower than those of most
traditional catalysts. Especially for the BOC catalyst, although its
overpotential is not the lowest at present, easy preparation and high
stability are its advantages. This contrast indicates that BOC is
a promising catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to formate.

Baruch et
al. found that carbonate is the reaction intermediate
for the reduction of CO2 to formate.21,22 If an electrocatalyst can form a complex with carbonate, it may
decrease the overpotential for the reduction of CO2 to
formate by lowering the free energy of formation of the carbonate
intermediate. According to this strategy, BOC was chosen as the electrocatalyst
for the reduction of CO2 to formate in this work because
carbonate is already bonded in the structure of BOC, which likely
takes part in the reaction as the intermediate. The proposed mechanism
for the reduction of CO2 to formate on the BOC catalyst
is shown in Scheme 1. The first step is one electron transfer to carbonate from BOC.
Then, the initial carbonate in the structure of BOC converts to the
formate anion by reacting with H+ and adding another electron.
Finally, the formate anion dissociates from the surface of BOC to
the electrolyte. After that, BOC has a vacancy and can react with
CO2 and return to its initial state. It is interesting
that the structure of this vacancy consists of Bi• and O–. Bi• may adsorb an O
atom of the CO2 molecule, and O– may
adsorb the C atom of the CO2 molecule. In this way, one
CO2 molecule can be adsorbed by two active sites at the
same time, which may be beneficial for the reduction of CO2 to formate. The advantage of the BOC electrocatalyst is that bonding
carbonate can lower the energy barrier for the reduction of CO2 to formate, which may decrease the overpotential of the reaction.
This proposed mechanism is consistent with the above experimental
results, which indicates that our strategy for designing the electrocatalyst
is successful.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Reduction of CO2 to Formate
on the BOC Catalyst
Currently, it is very challenging
to characterize the right active sites of the catalysts.35 The partially oxidized atomic Co layer (CoOx/Co) is one of the most effective catalysts
for the reduction of CO2 to formate, but the reaction mechanism
remains uncertain.34 Inspired by the reaction
mechanism in Scheme 1, the hybrid structure of the CoOx/Co
catalyst may also adsorb one CO2 molecule with two active
sites at the same time. It is reported that the surface structures of Sn, In, and Bi electrodes are also SnOx/Sn, InOx/In, and BiOx/Bi, respectively,12,21,36 whereas higher overpotentials are needed
for the reduction of CO2 to formate. This can be explained
by the fact that the surface states of the outermost layers on Sn, In,
and Bi are mainly the oxides and by the lack of synergy between metals
and metal oxides. The surface oxide layer can only adsorb the C atom
of the CO2 molecule; this is not conducive for the conversion
of the CO2 molecule into the carbonate intermediate. Thus,
the overpotentials for the reduction of CO2 to formate
on the Sn, In, and Bi electrodes are higher than those on BOC. We
believe that the reaction mechanism in this work for the reduction
of CO2 to formate will pave the way toward the target-specific
synthesis of highly active and stable catalysts. Further efforts are
still needed to confirm the reaction pathway.

3 Conclusions
BOC nanosheets (20–40 nm thick) were synthesized for the
electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. RB was also
prepared for comparing the catalytic performance toward CO2 reduction to that of BOC. BOC showed a high activity and selectivity
toward formate production at a low overpotential compared to those
of RB. The maximum FE of BOC is 83% at −1.2 V, which is slightly
lower than that of RB (90% obtained at −1.6 V), but the overpotential
for the reduction of CO2 to formate on BOC is lower than
that on RB and most traditional catalysts. A long-time electrolysis
experiment showed that the BOC electrocatalyst possesses a high stability
for producing formate. We proposed a possible reaction mechanism on
BOC. The carbonate of BOC, as the intermediate of the reduction of
CO2 to formate, is beneficial for lowering the overpotential
of the reaction.

4 Methods
4.1 Synthesis
of the BOC Catalyst
All
reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The
procedure for preparing the BOC catalyst is as follows: 1 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (dissolved in 20 mL of
deionized water) and 50 mmol urea (dissolved in 20 mL of alcohol)
were mixed together by magnetic stirring. After stirring for 30 min,
the above mixture was heated to 90 °C for 4 h in a water bath
and then cooled to room temperature. The resultant white BOC was collected
by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and alcohol, and dried
at 60 °C for 12 h.

4.2 Modified Electrode Preparation
BOC
(20 mg) was first dispersed in 500 μL of alcohol under ultrasonication.
Then, 50 μL of 5% Nafion solution was added to the suspension
to form the sample solution during the ultrasound treatment process.
Prior to each modification, an L-style GCE (5 mm in diameter) was
polished with alumina powder, sonicated in alcohol and deionized water
successively, and dried under nitrogen. Then, 10 μL of the as-prepared
sample solution was cast onto the GCE and dried in air.

4.3 Electrochemical Experiments
The electrochemical
experiments were performed in an undivided three-electrode glass cell
with a Pt plate counter electrode (2 cm2) and a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode (saturated KCl). The working electrode was the
BOC-modified GCE. All potential values were in reference to those
of the Ag/AgCl electrode. The electrolyte used was 20 mL of an aqueous
solution of 0.1 mol L–1 KHCO3.

LSV, with a scan rate of 50 mV s–1, was carried
out using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua
Instruments Co., Ltd., China) in a N2- or CO2-saturated electrolyte (here, the electrolyte was bubbled with N2 or CO2 for 30 min prior to the measurement). The
current density was determined on the area of the GCE. Controlled
potential electrolysis was performed using a LAND CT2001C cell performance-testing
instrument (Wuhan Electronics Co., Ltd., China). The electrolyte was
saturated with CO2 before the electrolysis experiment,
and CO2 gas was aerated continuously at a flow rate of
10 mL min–1 during the electrolysis process. The
total charge passed was 10 C.

To acquire the ECSA of the working
electrodes, their roughness
factor (Rf) should be obtained first according
to the equation ECSA = RfS, where S is generally equal to the geometric area
of the GCE (in this work, S = 0.196 cm2). The Rf was determined by the relation Rf = Cdl/60 μF
cm–2 on the basis of the double-layer capacitance
(Cdl) of a smooth oxide surface (60 μF
cm–2). Cdl was estimated
by plotting the charging current density differences (Δj) at −0.75 V against the scan rate, in which the
slope was twice that of Cdl. Δj = ja – jc, where jc and ja are the cathodic and anodic current densities, respectively.
Δj could be acquired by cyclic voltammetry
measurements under the potential windows of −0.8 to −0.7
V (0.1 mol L–1 KHCO3 aqueous solution).

4.4 Analysis and Calculations
The morphologies
of BOC and RB were observed using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM. The TEM observation
was carried out using a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM instrument. The XRD pattern
of BOC was obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 0.15406 nm). The
valence state of Bi on the surfaces of the electrocatalysts was quantified
by an ESCALAB 250Xi XPS instrument. Ion chromatography (IC) was employed
to quantify the concentration of the formate product in the aqueous
solutions. The IC data was obtained using a Dionex ICS-5000+ ion chromatography instrument.

The FE for producing formate
can be determined by the equation 2  where n is the number
of
moles of the formate product, which can be calculated according to
the IC data, F is Faraday’s constant, with
a value of 96 485 C mol–1, and Q is the total charge passed during electrolysis (here, Q = 10 C).
