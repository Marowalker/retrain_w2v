The
multistate of chemical species generated by 4′-hydroxy-3,2′-furanoflavylium
is similar to that of anthocyanins and related compounds. This furanoflavylium
multistate system was fully characterized by UV–visible and
NMR spectroscopy, allowing determination of the respective equilibrium
and rate constants. In contrast to the multistate generated by flavylium
cations derived from anthocyanins and related compounds, the furanoflavylium
multistate is characterized by much slower hydration and tautomerization
(pyran ring opening–closing). In addition, the cis–trans isomerization of the chalcones of this system (2′-hydroxyaurones)
is extremely slow when compared with anthocyanins. The observed similar
order of magnitude for tautomerization and isomerization rate constants
leads to peculiar kinetics from the flavylium cation (pH = 1) to the
stable trans-chalcone (higher pH values). The hemiketal
appears and disappears during the first stages of the kinetics, which
gives the intermediate cis-chalcone (pseudo-equilibrium).
This last species disappears in a much slower process, as fully characterized
by 1H NMR, to give the final trans-chalcone.

Introduction
In
the past years, it was reported that a network of chemical species
originating in solution from anthocyanins, that is, its multistate
of chemical species, can be found in structurally related compounds.
Anthocyanidins,1,2 deoxyanthocyanidins,3−5 styrylflavylium,6 naphthoflavylium,7 and other synthetic flavylium compounds8 are examples of molecules that generate the same
multistate observed in anthocyanins. In some cases, other chemical
species not appearing in the anthocyanin multistate are formed, such
as flavanones from 2′-hydroxyflavylium compounds9 and 2,2′-spirobis[chromene] derivatives
from 2,6-bis(arylidene)cyclohexanones.10,11,a

Aurones are a class of flavonoids that
are responsible for giving
color to mosses, ferns, and marine brown algae, as well as bright
yellow colors to some flowers.12 The subclass
of 2′-hydroxyaurones is able to form furanoflavylium cations,
such as riccionidin A.13 In this work,
we report a model compound, furanoflavylium 1, and the
multistate of species originating from it in aqueous solution, in
particular, its corresponding 2′-hydroxyaurone, 2 (see Scheme 1). To
our knowledge, the term furanoflavylium was coined by Seshadri14,b to designate
flavylium compounds containing a furan ring between rings C and B,
with the oxygen linking positions 3 and 2′, like in riccionidin
A.

Scheme 1 Riccionidin A, 4′-Hydroxy-3,2′-furanoflavylium
(1), and Its Respective 2′-Hydroxyaurone (2)
Anthocyanin history
demonstrated that synthetic flavylium compounds
are very important to fully understand anthocyanin multistate kinetics
and thermodynamics; in particular, the inclusion of trans-chalcone in the anthocyanin multistate should be considered.8 In this work, we synthesized and fully characterized
the multistate of chemical species originating from the compound 4′-hydroxy-3,2′-furanoflavylium
(8-hydroxybenzofuro[3,2-b]chromen-5-ium, 1) hydrogen sulfate. Similar to the role played by synthetic flavylium
compounds on the comprehension of the anthocyanin multistate, our
present results could pave the way for future descriptions of the
multistates of naturally occurring furanoanthocyanins.15,c For this
reason we chose as a model compound a very simple furanoflavylium
(1), where we introduced only one hydroxyl group (to
allow formation of the quinoidal base species; see below). The main
scope of this work is to investigate the multistate of species of
furanoflavylium cations, which includes 2′-hydroxyaurones (see
below, Scheme 3), and
compare it with the known multistate of flavylium salts that includes
2-hydroxychalcones (also designated as retrochalcones; see Scheme 2).

(the Flavylium Analogue of Furanoflavylium 1)19,20
State of the Art in Anthocyanin Multistate
Anthocyanins
and other flavylium salt derivatives are characterized by the existence
of three kinetic steps that are well separated with time, allowing
the study of each one separately. The energy level diagram presented
in Scheme 2 for 4′-hydroxyflavylium
is appropriate to account for the chemistry of the network of chemical
species present in flavylium salts multistates.16−18

At lower
pH values, the flavylium cation (AH+) is the stable species.
Raising the pH (defined as direct pH jumps) leads to the formation
of a quinoidal base (A) upon proton transfer to water (eq 1). This reaction is by far the fastest
of the multistate. The rate of this process, k1d (eq 2), is
very fast (μs) and requires special techniques, such as temperature
jumps,21 to be adequately characterized.
However, representation of the pH-dependent absorption spectra taken
10 ms after the direct pH jump by means of stopped-flow experiments
permits calculation of the value of Ka. During the subsequent kinetic processes, AH+ and A remain
in equilibrium with a ratio [A]/[AH+] = Ka/[H+]. 1   2  

The next step, second step in Scheme 2, is controlled by the hydration
reaction.
Unless for very acidic solutions, which are not accessible by direct
pH jumps, the hydration reaction in eq 3 (seconds to minutes) is slower than tautomerization
in eq 4 (milliseconds
to seconds). 3   4  

The
rate constant of this step is given by eq 5 5  where XB and XCc are the mole fractions
of B and Cc, respectively, in eq 4.

Finally, the system reaches its thermodynamic equilibrium
upon cis–trans isomerization
of the chalcone
species, a process that takes hours or days (eq 6). 6  

Considering
that the isomerization is much slower than the other
processes, all species except Ct can be considered in equilibrium
during the isomerization. The transient state that is reached when
AH+, A, B, and Cc are in equilibrium, before formation
of significant amounts of Ct, is defined as “pseudo-equilibrium”.

The rate constant of the isomerization step is given by eq 7 7  where XCc is the mole
fraction of cis-chalcone at
the pseudo-equilibrium and Ka^ is
the constant of the pseudo-equilibrium
(see eqs 10 and 11 below).

The overall equilibrium, in spite
of its complexity, can be described
by a simple acid–base equilibrium involving the flavylium cation
and its conjugate base, CB, composed of the other species: [CB] =
[A] + [B] + [Cc] + [Ct].22 8   9  

The pseudo-equilibrium (eq 10) is defined by a similar equation where Ct is now
excluded:
[CB^] = [A] + [B] + [Cc]. 10   11  

It is possible to extend the study of the kinetics
and thermodynamics
of the equilibrium and pseudo-equilibrium to the basic region, by
considering consecutive deprotonations of the species (eqs 12–15 and 16–19).

Second
set of acid–base equilibria  

Third set of
acid–base equilibria  

This system is
thus equivalent to a single polyprotic acid, with eq 8 accounting for the first
global acid–base equilibrium, Ka′, and eqs 20 and 21 accounting for the second and third acid–base equilibria,
respectively, Ka″ and Ka‴, 20   21  where 22   23  

The relations between the global acid–base constants, Ka″ and Ka‴, and the equilibrium constants for each reaction are
given, respectively, by eqs 24 and 25. 24   25  These expressions can be
generalized to further deprotonated species, but in general, anthocyanins
are not stable in basic medium.

In conclusion, in spite of the
complexity of this system, the flavylium
cation can be considered a simple polyprotic acid, and the respective
acidity constants are straightforwardly calculated from the inflection
points of the representation of the absorbance versus pH.

Results
and Discussion
Furanoflavylium 1 was synthesized
as its hydrogen
sulfate salt from the condensation of salicylaldehyde with 6-hydroxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one in a mixture of acetic acid and sulfuric acid. To
our knowledge, the only synthesis of furanoflavylium salts reported
so far is that of Seshadri, where compound 1 as its chloride
salt was also reported.14

Similarly
to some synthetic flavylium compounds that have been
used as models for anthocyanins such as 4′-hydroxyflavylium,
the kinetics of compound 1 taking place after direct
pH jumps from a very acidic solution to acidic/moderately basic media
or to very basic media behave differently.23 The reason is that in acidic/moderately basic medium, the quinoidal
base does not hydrate, a breakthrough discovered by Brouillard and
Dubois.24 However, in very basic solutions,
the hydroxide anion attacks the quinoidal base to give ionized cis-chalcone, and the respective rate is directly proportional
to the hydroxide concentration.25 This
behavior is illustrated in Figure 1a,b for compound 1. The spectral variations
taken 1 min after a direct pH jump to the range 1.0 < pH < 9
(Figure 1a) show an
equilibrium between the flavylium cation, AH+, and the
quinoidal base, A. The spectra are compatible with an acid–base
equilibrium between AH+ and A with pKa = 3.6, according to eq 1 and the first step in Scheme 2. Upon a pH jump to pH = 10 (Figure 1b), after 810 s, the quinoidal base is already
consumed to give an absorption spectrum that was assigned to ionized
Cc (see below).

Figure 1 (A) Spectral variations of compound 1 (2.31
×
10–5 M), taken 1 min after a direct pH jumps to
1.0 < pH < 9.0. The spectral variations are accounted for by
an acid–base equilibrium between AH+ and A, with
pKa = 3.6 (eq 1). (B) Spectral variations after a direct
pH jump to 10.0. (C) Spectral variations after a direct pH jump from
pH = 1.0 to 5.5.

The spectral variations
after a direct pH jump to pH = 5.5 are
shown in Figure 1c.
The kinetics takes place in two different time scales: (i) after approximately
18 h, the absorption spectrum is that of chalcone (green line), and
(ii) after 531 h, another red-shifted chalcone-type absorption spectrum
is formed (orange line). The NMR data reported below allows us to
conclude that the green spectrum can be attributed to cis-chalcone and the orange one to trans-chalcone.
Moreover, the NMR data also shows that during the first hours, the
hemiketal, B, grows in amount and then decreases before reaching the
pseudo-equilibrium. This particular aspect needs a further explanation
because it is not observed in anthocyanins.

To get more insight
into the kinetics toward the pseudo-equilibrium
and further to the equilibrium, a series of direct pH jumps were performed,
as exemplified for pH = 5.5 in Figures 1c (spectra) and 2 (kinetic traces
and fittings). Regarding the kinetics toward the pseudo-equilibrium
and taking into account that the hemiketal, B, is formed and decreases
during the first stages of the process, a kinetic model of the type
AH+/A → B → Cc was considered.d

Figure 2 (A) Absorbance as a function of time after a direct pH jump of
compound 1 to pH = 5.5 toward the pseudo-equilibrium.
The kinetic traces can be fitted by two consecutive reactions with
rate constants of 1.3 × 10–4 and 6.0 ×
10–4 s–1. (B) A second and much
slower step that transforms the green spectrum of Figure 1c into the orange one can be
fitted with a rate constant of 2.8 × 10–6 s–1.

In anthocyanins and related
compounds, the tautomerization is much
faster than hydration, unless for very acidic pH values not accessed
by direct pH jumps. In other words, as soon as B is formed, it equilibrates
with Cc to give the pseudo-equilibrium in a ratio that is given by Kt = [Cc]/[B], as seen in the second step in Scheme 2. In the case of
compound 1, the system was treated considering two consecutive
reactions (Figure 2a). In spite of the high estimated error (ca. 20%), a fitting with
global rate constants equal to 1.3 × 10–4 and
6.0 × 10–4 s–1 was achieved
(Figure 2a). The pseudo-equilibrium
is reached through the hydration reaction, exhibiting the slower constant,
followed by the slightly faster tautomerization reaction. The fact
that the tautomerization is only approximately 5-fold faster than
hydration is the reason why at the initial stages of the kinetic process,
there is some appearance and further disappearance of B. A further
slower process with a rate constant equal to 2.8 × 10–6 s–1 was attributed to the formation of trans-chalcone, given by eq 6 and as seen in the third step in Scheme 2, as confirmed by NMR (see Figure 8 below).

A
series of pH jumps like those reported in Figure 1 were carried out, and the respective absorption
spectra after 20 h (at the pseudo-equilibrium) are represented in Figure 3. The pseudo-equilibrium
in the pH range 1 < pH < 4.2 with pKa^ =
1.8 is achieved
between the flavylium cation and the neutral cis-chalcone
(Figure 3a). The spectral
variations reported in Figure 3b,c are compatible with the monoionized and diionized cis-chalcone molecules with pKa^^ = 6.55 and pKa^^^ = 9.2.

Figure 3 Spectral variations of compound 1 (2.31 × 10–5 M) approximately 20 h after direct pH jumps to pH
values in the ranges: (A) 1.0 ≤ pH ≤ 4.2, (B) 4.2 ≤
pH ≤ 8.44, and (C) 8.44 ≤ pH ≤ 11.9. The data
could be fitted with pKa^ =
1.8, pKa^^ = 6.55, and pKa^^^ = 9.2 for the
three pH ranges.

Accurate quantitative
determination of the apparent pKa values
at the equilibrium (after 546 h) is
not possible
due to some observed precipitation in water. The following values
are only rough estimations: pKa′ ≈ 1.2, pKa″ ≈ 5.3, and pKa‴ ≈ 9.1.

More information
on the multistate was achieved by means of a series
of reverse pH jumps carried out by the addition of acid (back to pH
= 1) to equilibrated solutions at higher pH values. These experiments
have shown that cis-chalcone is extremely (meta)stable.
For example, a reverse pH jump back to pH = 1.0 does not give back
the flavylium cation in several days at room temperature. However,
when the reverse pH jump is made by addition of sulfuric acid diluted
in acetic acid with the solution heated at 100 °C, the characteristic
absorption spectrum of the flavylium cation starts to appear.

The metastability of trans-chalcone in this family
of compounds was previously reported for 2,3,6,8-tetrahydroxybenzofuro[3,2-b][l]benzopyrylium chloride (riccionidin A).26 The synthesis of riccionidin A from the reaction
of 2,4,5-trihydroxybenzaldehyde with 5,6-dihydroxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one gives trans-chalcone that evolves
in acetic acid saturated with gaseous HCl to the respective flavylium
cation in approximately 125 h at 100 °C in a percentage of 5% trans-chalcone and 95% flavylium cation.26

Upon titration of cis-chalcone,
the absorption
spectra (Figure 4)
show the presence of Cc, Cc–, and Cc2– species, with pKCc/Cc– = 6.7 and pKCc–/Cc2– = 9.0.

Figure 4 (A) Absorption spectra taken immediately after a series
of reverse
pH jumps from pseudo-equilibrated solutions of 1 (1.15
× 10–5 M) at pH = 10.3 (for 30 min) to lower
pH values. (B) Traces of the absorption as a function of pH. Two inflection
points of the acidity constants were obtained at pH = 6.7 and 8.9.

The rate constants of a series
of direct pH jumps as shown in Figure 1a are represented
in Figure 5. The kinetic
processes regarding the evolution toward the pseudo-equilibrium (Figure 5a) have two distinct
regimes. At low pH values (pH < 4), the hydration, which is proportional
to [H+], should be very fast, and thus, the observed kinetics
is dominated by the tautomerization process. The observed increase
in this rate constant with increasing pH is related to the fraction
of B available to give Cc, and the respective inflection point should
reflect the pKh. The regime in the range
4 < pH < 7 was attributed to the hydration control as observed
in anthocyanins and related compounds. The following kinetic expressions
should be considered only as a semiquantitative kinetic analysis of
the process.

Figure 5 (A) Representation of the kinetic processes of compound 1 following a series of direct pH jumps toward the pseudo-equilibrium
and (B) that from the pseudo-equilibrium to the equilibrium: ki = 2.3 × 10–6 s–1 (Cc to Ct) and ki– =
1.5 × 10–5 s–1 (Cc– to Ct–).

When the hydration control is concerned, the following expression
can be considered 31  where XAH+ is the mole fraction
of AH+ in equilibrium
with B. The fitting was achieved for pKa = 3.6 and kh = 0.01 s–1 and is independent of k–h.

Regarding the tautomerization control, the species AH+ and B are considered equilibrated because at low pH values, the
hydration is much faster. 32  A second approximation (by
neglecting the back reaction) results from the very slow kinetics
of the reverse pH jumps from Cc at the pseudo-equilibrium back to
the acidic region. Fitting was achieved for pKh = 4.05 and kt = 0.004 s–1. At higher pH values (pH > 7), the kinetics toward the pseudo-equilibrium
is proportional to [OH–], and we assigned this process
to hydroxide attack to the quinoidal base, as observed in synthetic
flavylium compounds.25 Fitting of this
branch was achieved for kOH = 50 M–1 s–1. 33  

From the pseudo-equilibrium to the equilibrium, the kinetics
is
very slow, Figure 5b. The following mathematical expression considers that in the pH
range of Figure 5b,
Cc and Cc– are the only species at the pseudo-equilibrium
and the back reaction can be neglected. Fitting was achieved for ki = 2.3 × 10–6 s–1 (Cc to Ct) and ki– = 1.5 × 10–5 s–1 (Cc– to Ct–). 34  Upon titration of trans-chalcone, the absorption
spectra (Figure 6)
show the presence of the
species Ct (brown), Ct– (red), and Ct2– (green) with pKCt/Ct– = 6.6 and pKCt–/Ct2– = 8.8.e

The results can be summarized in Scheme 3 and Table 1.

Inspection
of Table 1 permits
us to conclude that the 3,2′-O-bridge
of the furan moiety of compound 1 stabilizes the quinoidal
base and the hemiketal species in comparison with the model 4′-hydroxyflavylium
cation.

Using the above values for the equilibrium and rate
constants,
the following energy level diagram for compound 1 in
acidic medium can be drawn (Scheme 4).

Aqueous Acidic
Medium
NMR Experiments
The results above described were corroborated
through a series of NMR experiments. Due to the limited solubility
of compound 1 in water at neutral pH values, a DMSO/D2O mixture (1:1) was used to perform NMR experiments in this
pH range. In this mixture of solvents, the absorption spectra behave
similarly to water. In Figure 6, the evolution of the multistate toward the pseudo-equilibrium
after a direct pH jump to pD = 5.8 followed by 1H NMR is
shown.

Full characterization and assignment of 1H
and 13C signals were achieved with correlation spectroscopy
(COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy,
and heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) spectroscopy (Table S2, Supporting Information) allowing the
identification of the corresponding cis-chalcone
structure, after 300 min of equilibration. The 13C NMR
signals at 182.7 and 149.4 ppm, assigned to carbons 5a and 10a, respectively
(see Table S2, Supporting Information),
permit us to conclude that the furan ring is stable and does not undergo
ring opening reaction under these conditions (see below).27,28

The NMR data reported in Figure 7 together with the results reported in Figure 2a show a large difference
in
the kinetics of compound 1 when compared with anthocyanins.
The rates toward pseudo-equilibrium and equilibrium of compound 1 are remarkably slower than those of anthocyanins. However,
the most significant difference is in the fact that hydration and
tautomerization rates are similar, whereas in anthocyanins and related
compounds, the tautomerization occurs in subseconds, and the hydration
takes place in several minutes (except for very low pH values not
accessed by direct pH jumps).

Figure 7 1H NMR spectra of compound 1 with the kinetics
toward the pseudo-equilibrium in a DMSO/D2O (1:1) mixture
at pD = 5.8 at different times.

The remarkable difference of the kinetics between the present
compound
and anthocyanins and related compounds, which consists of the appearance
and disappearance of B during the first stages of the kinetics (Figure 2a) was confirmed
by 1H NMR (Figure 7). The rising and decreasing amount of B can only be explained
if the difference between the rates of the hydration and tautomerization
reactions is relatively small.

After reaching the pseudo-equilibrium,
the system proceeds to the
formation of trans-chalcone, a process that is almost
completed only after 355 h (Figure 8). Full characterization and
assignment of 1H and 13C signals were achieved
with HSQC, HMBC, and COSY spectroscopy (Table S3, Supporting Information), allowing the identification of
the trans-chalcone structure, after 355 h of equilibration.
Similar to those of cis-chalcone, the 13C NMR signals at 184.6 and 148.7 ppm, assigned to carbon atoms 5a
and 10a, respectively (see Table S3, Supporting information), allow confirmation of the stability of the furan
ring.27,28 The configuration of the double bond could
be confirmed by comparing the chemical shift of C-11 in both chalcone-type
structures. It has been reported that the resonance of C-11 of trans-aurones systematically occurs at approximately 10
ppm upfield from its position in cis-aurones;28 in the aurones derived from compound 1, the C-11 peaks at 117.0 ppm for cis-chalcone and
at 108.7 ppm for trans-chalcone (Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information).

Figure 8 1H NMR of
compound 1 in a DMSO-d6/D2O (1:1) mixture at pD = 6.3 evolving
from the pseudo-equilibrium toward the equilibrium.

To corroborate the stability of the furan ring
in the structure,
an aliquot of the equilibrated NMR tube solution (after 355 h) was
analyzed by mass spectrometry. A base peak of m/z of 253 (negative ion mode) was detected. This result along
with the NMR data obtained allows us to confirm the stability of the
furan ring in the structure.

To characterize the species present
under basic conditions, compound 1 was dissolved in H2O, and the pH was adjusted
up to 10.0 with 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution. The evolution of the
system was monitored by 1H NMR, and it is similar to the
one observed at pD ≈ 6. The first spectrum collected approximately
15 min after the pH jump showed the presence of only one chalcone-type
species. Full characterization and assignment of 1H and 13C signals were achieved with HSQC, HMBC, and COSY spectroscopy
(Table S4, Supporting Information), allowing
the identification of the corresponding doubly deprotonated cis-chalcone (Cc2–). The 13C NMR signals at 180.3 and 148.9 ppm, assigned to carbon atoms 5a
and 10a, respectively (see Table S4, Supporting information), allow
us to propose that the furan ring is also stable under basic conditions.27,28 The system proceeds to full formation of the deprotonated trans-chalcone (Ct2–) after 32 days. Full
characterization and assignment of 1H and 13C signals for this species were achieved with HSQC, HMBC, and COSY
spectroscopy (Table S5, Supporting Information). The 13C NMR signals at 183.9 and 151.0 ppm, assigned
to carbons 5a and 10a, respectively, prove the stability of the furan
ring over this long period of equilibration.27,28 The configuration of the double bond has also been confirmed by
comparing the chemical shift of C-11 in both chalcone-type structures:28 C-11 peaks at 116.5 ppm for Cc2– and at 108.2 ppm for Ct2– (Tables S4 and S5, Supporting Information).

Conclusions
The synthetic furanoflavylium follows the same multistate of chemical
species of simple flavylium cations and anthocyanins. Direct pH jumps
of the flavylium cation from pH = 1 to higher pH values show that
this species evolves slowly to the thermodynamically favorable trans-chalcone (trans-2′-hydroxyaurone)
in two steps well separated with time: (i) from the flavylium cation
and/or the quinoidal base to cis-chalcone via the
hemiketal (which is observed as an intermediate species during the
first stages of the kinetics) in a few hours, and ii) from cis-chalcone to trans-chalcones in a few
weeks. On the other hand, the reverse pH jumps from higher pH values
to pH < 1 reveal that trans-chalcone and cis-chalcone are metastable in accordance with the results
previously reported for riccionidin A. In plant evolution, the species
using aurones to give color have appeared before the species that
use anthocyanins in the same scope. The interesting conclusion is
that in both cases, the same basic multistate of chemical species
is present. In other words, the anthocyanin multistate of chemical
species has an ancestor in furanoflavylium derivatives.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All solvents and chemicals employed
for synthesis and preparation of samples were of reagent or spectrophotometric
grade and used as received. Millipore-grade water was used. NMR spectra
were run on a Bruker Advance III 400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H, 100 MHz for 13C) at 298 K. NMR assignments have
been carried out on the basis of 1D NMR spectra (1H, 13C, and DEPT 135) and 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC).
Elemental analysis was performed on an elemental analysis system (Thermo
Finnigan-CE Instruments Flash EA 1112 CHNS series). MS spectra were
recorded in an Esquire 6000 spectrometer equipped with an ion trap
analyzer (Esquire 6000; Bruker Daltonics). Data were acquired using
an electrospray source in negative mode.

Thermodynamic and Kinetic
Studies
The pH jumps were
carried out by adding a stock solution of flavylium salt in 0.1 M
HCl (1 mL) to a 3 mL quartz cuvette containing a solution of 0.1M
NaOH (1 mL) and Theorell and Stenhagen universal buffer (1 mL)29,f at the desired
final pH. This defined the ionic strength as 0.1 M (controlled by
the NaCl concentration resulting from neutralization). The final pH
of the solutions was measured using a Crison basic 20+ pH meter. Spectroscopic
measurements were performed using Milli-Q water with a constant temperature
of 20 ± 1 °C, with a Varian-Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer.

a similar procedure to that described previously by our group.30 Then, Et2O (50 mL) was added, and
a red solid precipitated. The solid was filtered off, carefully washed
with Et2O, and dried, yielding the furanoflavylium salt 1 (0.282 g; 0.78 mmol; 80% yield). 1H NMR (400
MHz, DMSO-d6:TFA 4:1) δ 9.42 (s,
1H), 8.36 (m, 2H), 8.29 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 8.14 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.89 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.31 (d, J = 2.1 Hz, 1H), 7.26 (dd, J = 9.0, 2.1
Hz, 1H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, DMSO-d6:TFA 4:1) δ 172.5, 168.0, 162.5, 153.2, 147.4, 136.3,
132.0, 130.1, 129.3, 127.7, 122.6, 120.0, 119.3, 107.7, 99.9. Elemental
analysis (%): found C, 50.09; H, 3.42; S, 9.35; calcd. for C15H10SO7·1.5 H2O: C, 49.86; H,
3.63; S, 8.87. A solution of compound 1 at pD of ∼6.0,
equilibrated for 355 h, was analyzed by mass spectrometry. ITMS (ESI–): calcd. for C15H9O4: m/z (%) 253.05 (100); found:
252.6 [M–] (100).

NMR Experiments
NMR spectroscopy was performed by dissolving
5 mg of pure compound 1 in a mixture of DMSO-d6/D2O (1:1) using 0.1 M NaOD to adjust
the pD to ∼6. To avoid loss of proton signals under basic conditions
due to exchange with deuterium, the compound was dissolved in H2O, and the pH was adjusted to ∼10 using 0.1 M NaOH.
In this case, a closed tube containing D2O was used inside
the NMR tube for deuterium lock, and the water signal was suppressed
by irradiation. Both NMR tubes were protected from light during the
equilibration process. Some precipitation was observed at pH = 10.0,
and after 32 days, it became necessary to heat the solution up to
60 °C for approximately 1 h. The 1D and 2D NMR experiments of
equilibrated solution of compound 1 at pH = 10.0 were
also performed at 60 °C.

a In acidic medium, these compounds
give rise to styrylflavylium cations.

b T. R. Seshadri has a large body of
work on anthocyanin derivatives, coming from the school of Robert
Robinson, his PhD supervisor.

c We noticed that during the XXIXth
ICP, Madison, WI, USA, 2018, from the lecture by Professor Kevin Davies,
he, in collaboration with Professor Øyvind Andersen has isolated
and purified a natural aurone capable of giving the furanoflavylium
cation, which is now under study by their groups.

d Similar shapes of the kinetic traces
for AH+/A, B, and Cc are observed if reversibility between
B and Cc is considered.

e Kinetics
of the ionized trans-chalcone is faster at basic
pH values, and the titration was carried
out from the ionized species back to their neutral form.

f The universal buffer used was prepared
in the following way: 85% (w/w) phosphoric acid (2.3 mL), monohydrated
citric acid (7.00 g), and boric acid (3.54 g) were dissolved in water;
1 M NaOH (343 mL) was then added, and the solution was diluted to
1 L with water.
