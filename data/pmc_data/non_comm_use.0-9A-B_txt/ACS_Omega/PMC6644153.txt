Luminescent materials with red emission
are promising materials
for optoelectronic devices and biological sciences. However, their
synthesis is often complicated. In this work, we developed a facile
approach to generating red-emissive luminogens with aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) characteristics from commercially available reactants.
The new compounds, abbreviated PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz, were prepared
by coupling 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole
with (1-naphehyl)phenylamine or diphenylamine followed by the reaction
of the monobromo-substituted compounds with carbazole. Although all
of the reactants were non-AIE-active, PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz showed
AIE characteristics. This suggested that the AIE chromophores were
generated in situ through the reactions. PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz were
soluble in common organic solvents and showed red emission with high
fluorescence quantum yields of 42.2 and 38.3% in the film, respectively.
They were thermally and morphologically stable, as revealed by their
high decomposition temperature (up to 327 °C) and glass-transition
temperature (up to 120 °C). Nondoped organic light-emitting diodes
with a configuration of ITO/HATCN/TAPC/PN-BTZ-Cz or DP-BTZ-Cz/Bphen/Liq/Al
were fabricated using these compounds as emitting layers, which emitted
red electroluminescence at a low turn-on voltage (down to 2.8 V) with
a maximum external quantum yield of up to 2.7% and a small efficiency
roll-off.

Introduction
Organic fluorescent
materials with red emission have found extensive
applications in optoelectronics and biological sciences. As their
emission color belongs to one of the three primary ones, they are
also important for full-color display and white light devices. However,
compared to many efficient green and blue emissive materials, only
a few luminophores exhibit strong red emission.1,2 To
date, many systems are developed to create red emitters, including
lanthanide/transition-metal complexes, conjugated polymers, and organic
small molecules.3 Long-wavelength and even
near-infrared emission could be easily achieved in the organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) of organometallic complexes with their outstanding
electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies (3–24%) of their OLEDs.4 However, their air and moisture stability and
high cost are of concern. Organic polymers, on the other hand, possess
good solution processability and provide a more cost-effective approach
for mass production. However, their relatively low quantum yield and
exciton annihilation caused by their kinks are severe problems waiting
to be solved. Thus, organic small molecules offer the most promising
opportunity for creating new luminescent materials, thanks to their
easy color tunability by changing or modifying their chemical structures
through molecular engineering.5 To synthesize
red luminophores, introduction of large π-conjugation and strong
intramolecular donor–acceptor interaction is often needed to
decrease the band gap, both of which, however, will greatly increase
the intermolecular π–π interactions. It is known
that strong intermolecular π–π interaction is detrimental
to fluorescence emission, which is also the main cause of the aggregation-caused
quenching (ACQ) effect commonly observed in traditional luminophores
with planar structures.6,7 Although many strategies such
as the incorporation of steric bulky groups at the molecular level
or doping with host matrix at the device level can partially address
the ACQ problem, new problems such as complicated synthetic procedure
and poorer charge transportation emerge. The devices fabricated using
composites also suffer from high cost of mass production, performance
degradation caused by phase separation upon heating, and complexity
of technology due to addition of dopants. Thus, it is much desirable
to develop nondoped light-emitting systems.4

In 2001, Tang and co-workers8 observed
that some propeller-shaped luminogens showed no fluorescence or dim
emission in solution but bright emission in the aggregate state. They
termed this interesting phenomenon as aggregation-induced emission
(AIE). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the AIE effect.
Among them, the most commonly accepted interpretation is the restriction
of intermolecular motions (RIM), including the restriction of intermolecular
rotation and the restriction of intermolecular vibration.9 Take tetraphenylethylene (TPE), a typical AIE
luminogen (AIEgen), as an example; its four phenyl rings serve as
rotors and play a key role in relaxing the exciton energy through
the nonradiative channel in dilute solution. When TPE molecules are
aggregated, the rotors are restricted from undergoing any motions.
This blocks the nonradiative channels to allow TPE to emit intensely
in the aggregate state. Because AIEgens exhibit strong emission in
the solid state, they are promising materials for fabricating nondoped
organic OLEDs.10,11 Unfortunately, most of the AIEgens
prepared so far exhibit emission at short wavelength. This is because
that AIEgens generally adopt a twisted molecular conformation to show
low conjugation. This makes it difficult for them to show long-wavelength
emission. Nevertheless, through elaborate efforts, some red AIEgens
have been reported and some of them have been found to show very good
device performances.

For example, in 2011, Li et al.12 synthesized
a thermally stable AIE compound, namely, T2BT2, through embellishing a donor (D)−π–acceptor
(A) core (Figure 1).
A multilayered OLED built from it showed an EL maximum at approximately
590 nm (Table 1). In
2012, Zhao et al.13 reported a red luminophore,
abbreviated TTPEBTTD, by attaching three TPE units to the 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole
core. The nondoped OLED fabricated from it radiated a red light at
650 nm with a high efficiency of 3.7%. In 2015, Tang et al.14 developed a red emitter, called TTB, with bifunctional
properties of high hole transportation and strong solid-state light
emission. An EL device using TTB as a hole-transporting layer and
an emitting layer exhibited good performance with external efficiency
of up to 3.5%. Somanathan et al.cit15a designed
a class of luminophores with typical strong electron-donating phenothiazine
and electron-accepting α-cyanostilbene with end-capped naphthalene,
namely, PTNAA, in 2017. The PTNAA-based device showed a broad emission
peaked at 615 nm with an external efficiency of 7.13% and an AIE effect.
The same group reportedcit15b an emitter
consisting of two terminal attachments of a push–pull moiety
separated by a biphenyl free rotor, called BPPTA. Its nondoped device
showed a maximum brightness of 21 673 cd m–2 at 16 V. From the structures shown in Figure 1, we can see that the D−π–A−π–D
structure is a common way to construct red emitters to expand the
π-conjugation of the whole molecules, and the introduction of
typical AIE units such as TPE and cyanostilbene can endow the molecules
with AIE property reliably. Unfortunately, these luminogens are not
easy to synthesize because of a complicated structure, which is a
big shortcoming for mass production. Furthermore, the design strategy
of these red-emissive AIEgens is still limited, whereas a typical
AIE unit is needed mostly to guarantee the AIE characteristics.

Recently, our group4 developed a simple
method to produce efficient near-infrared AIEgens by Buchwald–Hartwig
coupling of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole
(BT-2Br) with tetraphenylethene-substituted arylamines (Scheme 1). A nondoped OLED using one
of the AIEgens was fabricated, which emitted at 684 nm with a large
radiance of ∼5800 mW Sr–1 m–2 and an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.73%. Although
the molecular design is interesting and the synthetic procedure is
much simpler than that of many of previously developed systems, presynthesis
of the AIEgen-containing reactants is required. This thus motivates
us to explore a more efficient molecular design and facile synthesis
method to produce efficient red-emissive AIEgens for nondoped OLED
application.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes to PN-BTZ and DP-BTZ-Cz
In this work, we developed
a facile approach to construct red AIEgens
from non-AIE reactants. The coupling of BT-2Br with 1 equivalent of
commercially available (1-naphthyl)phenylamine or diphenylamine followed
by end-capping of the resulting monobromo-substituted compounds with
carbazole generated the desirable products, abbreviated PN-BTZ-Cz
and DP-BTZ-Cz, respectively. Although PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz possess
no typical AIE building blocks such as TPE and silole, they show AIE
activity. Like other AIEgens, they are weakly emissive in solutions
but show bright red emission at 616 and 624 nm in the film state with
high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of 42.4 and 38.3%, respectively.
Nondoped OLEDs using them as emitting layers were fabricated, which
showed low turn-on voltages of 2.8 and 3.0 V with maximum EQEs of
2.7 and 2.1%, respectively.

Results and Discussion
The synthetic
routes to PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed
procedures are given in the Experimental Section. The structures of the intermediates and final products were characterized
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass
spectroscopy techniques with satisfactory results (see Figures S1–S12 in the Supporting Information).

In these molecules, the arylphenylamino group served as an electron
donor, whereas the benzo[1,2,5] thiadiazole core (BTZ) served as a
strong electron acceptor. The carbazole moiety,15 on the other hand, served dual functions. In one way, it
acted as an electron donor but with a weaker effect than that of the
phenylnaphthylamino (PN) and diphenylamino (DP) groups. In another
way, it endowed PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz with a more twisted structure
to reduce the likelihood of emission quenching in the solid state
by the ACQ effect. Both molecules showed good solubility in common
organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform, tetrahydrofuran,
and toluene, but were insoluble in water.

We then studied the
photophysical properties of the new molecules. Figure 2 shows the UV–vis
absorption spectra and PL spectra of PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), and Table 2 summarizes the results. The UV–vis spectra of PN-BTZ-Cz
peaked at 470 nm and originated from the intramolecular charge transfer
from the PN units to the central BTZ core (Figure 2A). The UV–vis spectrum of DP-BTZ-Cz
resembled that of PN-BTZ-Cz. When the dilute DMSO solutions of PN-BTZ-Cz
and DP-BTZ-Cz were photoexcited, red emission at 600 and 614 nm with
low absolute fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of
3.2 and 4.3% was observed, respectively (Figure 2B). In the solid state, PN-BTZ-Cz emitted
at 616 nm with a high ΦF of 42.4%. The increase in
ΦF from solution to the solid state suggests that
the molecule is AIE-active. DP-BTZ-Cz emitted at 624 nm when aggregated
accompanied by a high ΦF of 38.3%. Compared with
PN-BTZ-Cz, the less twisted structure of DP-BTZ-Cz may make it suffer
stronger intermolecular interactions16 in
the solid state to result in redder emission.

of PN-BTZ and DP-BTZ-Cz at their maximum emission are 3.2 and 4.3%,
respectively.

To gain deeper insight into the
PL properties of the molecules,
the fluorescence decays of PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz in DMSO and the
solid state were studied. The data is summarized in Table 2. The mean lifetime of PN-BTZ-Cz
in the solid state (14.95 ns) was longer than that in solution (12.13
ns), which was in agreement with the ΦF measurement
and the AIE characteristics of the molecule.

According to the
simplified relationship among ΦF, radiative decay
rate (kr), and nonradiative
decay rates (knr),17 i.e., ΦF = kr/(kr + knr), and fluorescence lifetime (τ) equals 1/(kr + knr) in quantum chemical
calculations, kr and knr were calculated to be 2.69 × 107 and
5.56 × 107 s–1 in solution and 2.84
× 107 and 3.85 × 107 s–1 in the solid state, respectively. Clearly, the large decrease in
the nonradiative decay rate leads to the ΦF enhancement
in the solid state. Similar results were obtained for DP-BTZ-Cz, and
the calculated kr and knr were 2.72 × 107 and 4.42 × 107 s–1 in solution and 2.39 × 107 and 3.85 × 107 s–1 in the
solid state, respectively.

The AIE characteristics of the molecules
were further confirmed
by studying their emission behaviors in DMSO/H2O mixtures.
Taking PN-BTZ-Cz as an example, addition of a small amount of water
(≤40%) into its dilute solution had weakened its PL intensity
(Figure 3A). As PN-BTZ-Cz
possesses an electron donor and acceptor in its structure, the enhancement
of the polarity of the solvent medium upon water addition may strengthen
the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect, resulting
in emission annihilation. The PL intensity increased swiftly at a
water fraction of 50% (Figure 3B). Due to its poor solubility in water, aggregates of PN-BTZ-Cz
should be readily formed in aqueous mixture with high water fraction.
According to the RIM mechanism of the AIE phenomenon, the intramolecular
motion is very active in pure DMSO but is restricted in the aggregate
state because of the physical constraints. Therefore, the loss of
excited-state energy through the nonradiative relaxation pathway is
prevented to enable PN-BTZ-Cz to show strong PL. Surprisingly, the
emission became weak again as the water fraction increased. This may
be ascribed to (1) the domination of the TICT effect over the AIE
effect on the light emission process and (2) the aggregate size effect.18,19 As the PL drop due to the TICT effect is obvious only at low water
fraction, the first factor is less likely to be the main reason for
such observation. On the other hand, dynamic light scattering analysis
showed that the aggregate size in 50% water fraction was 500 nm, which
decreased to 60 nm in 95% water fraction. Aggregates with smaller
sizes showed lesser luminogenic molecules inside, resulting in their
comparatively weaker emission than that of the larger ones. The emission
behaviors of DP-BTZ-Cz were similar to those of PN-BTZ-Cz with a more
obvious decrease in the PL intensity at a water fraction higher than
60% (Figure 3C,D).

and DP-BTZ-Cz in pure DMSO and DMSO/H2O mixture with fw = 50% taken under 365 nm UV irradiation from
a hand-held UV lamp.

To demonstrate that the PL drop in the DMSO/H2O mixture
with low water fraction is due to the TICT effect or that the present
molecules are TICT-active, their optical properties in different solvents
were investigated. As shown in Figure 4A,B, the solvent exerted a little influence on the
absorption of the molecules and the UV–vis spectra measured
in different solvents were basically the same and peaked at a similar
wavelength. However, the PL changed dramatically with solvent. PN-BTZ-Cz
emitted a strong yellow light in a nonpolar solvent such as hexane.
When the solvent was changed from relatively polar ones, such as DCM
and THF, to those with high polarity, such as acetone and methanol,
the emission wavelength gradually red-shifted. Meanwhile, the PL intensity
decreased with increasing solvent polarity. The PL spectrum in methanol
was basically a straight line parallel to the abscissa. A similar
phenomenon was also observed in DP-BTZ-Cz, and its PL maximum shifted
from 570 nm in hexane to 620 nm in acetone. Similarly, DP-BTZ-Cz exhibited
almost no fluorescence in methanol. The high sensitivity of light
emission from PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz to solvent polarity clearly
demonstrated the TICT characteristics of the molecules.

To further study the photophysical properties of PN-BTZ-Cz
and
DP-BTZ-Cz, theoretical calculations were carried out. Their molecular
conformations were optimized by the density function theory (DFT)
using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. The optimized molecular geometries
shown in Figure 5 suggested
that both molecules adopted twisted configurations with similar torsion
angles of around 60° between the BTZ unit and the carbazole moiety.
The phenyl ring and the naphthalene ring of the arylamino unit of
PN-BTZ-Cz were also twisted out of the central BTZ core with torsion
angles of 68 and 83°, respectively. A similar case was also observed
in DP-BTZ-Cz, and the torsion angle between both phenyl rings of the
unit and the central BTZ core was about 70°. The twisted conformation
of the two molecules not only provides a free space for the intramolecular
motions of the phenyl rings in dilute solution but also prohibits
close intermolecular packing in the solid state to endow PN-BTZ-Cz
and DP-BTZ-Cz with typical AIE characteristics. The highest occupied
molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of both molecules were distributed on the
donor fraction and the phenyl ring of BTZ. The lowest unoccupied molecular
orbitals (LUMOs), on the other hand, were mainly distributed on the
central BTZ moiety and the nitrogen atom of the arylamino unit. Such
an orbital distribution endows the molecules with an intramolecular
charge transfer character. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels
were −5.16 and −2.42 eV for PN-BTZ-Cz and −5.15
and −2.45 eV for DP-BTZ-Cz, respectively. Besides using DFT
calculation, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were also used to
determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the emitters. As shown
in Figure 6, PN-BTZ-Cz
and DP-BTZ-Cz exhibited a similar quasi-reversible oxidation process
with onset potentials of 0.93 and 0.91 V. The energy levels of the
HOMO and the LUMO were calculated from the onset oxidation potential
(Eonset) and the optical band gap Eg using the following equations: HOMO = −(4.4
+ Eonset) eV and LUMO = (HOMO + Eg) eV, where Eg =
1240/λonset and λonset is the onset
absorption wavelength,20 and these were
equal to −5.33 and −3.08 eV for PN-BTZ-Cz and −5.31
and −3.06 eV for DP-BTZ-Cz, respectively. The high HOMO energy
of the molecules suggests that they possess good electron-transporting
properties, and the narrow band gap of PN-BTZ-Cz and DN-BTZ-Cz, on
the other hand, was consistent with their red emission.

The thermal properties of PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz were studied
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. As shown in Figure 7A, PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz lose 5% of their weight at high temperatures
of 327 and 283 °C, suggestive of good thermal stability for film
fabrication by vapor deposition. The DSC curves of the molecules recorded
during the heating scan showed signals associated with their glass
transition at 119.6 and 95.8 °C, respectively, indicating their
high morphological stability.

The good optical and thermal properties
of the present AIEgens
encourage us to study their EL performance. OLEDs of PN-BTZ-Cz (devices
a and b) and DP-BTZ-Cz (devices c and d) with a configuration of indium

(Bphen) (55 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/Al were fabricated. In these devices, the
neat film of PN-BTZ-Cz or DP-BTZ-Cz served as an emitting layer (EML).
On the other hand, HATCN worked as a hole-injection layer, TAPC worked
as a hole-transport layer, TCTA was used as an electron-blocking layer,
and Bphen was used as an electron-transport layer. The performances
of the devices are shown in Table 3. Devices a and c were turned on at low voltages of
2.8 and 3.0 V, emitting red EL at 631 and 642 nm, respectively, with
luminance high enough for normal screen display and lighting (2566
and 1644 cd m–2, respectively) (Figure 8). The CIE coordinates were
(0.631, 0.368) and (0.642, 0.357), respectively, which were close
to the standard red color for OLED (0.67, 0.33). The maximum EQE values
were 2.7 and 2.1% with a relatively small roll-off at 1000 cd m–2. Devices b and d with a thicker TAPC layer (55 nm)
also showed red EL but with slightly poorer performances than those
of devices a and c, thanks to not only the efficient PL of PN-BTZ-Cz
and DP-BTZ-Cz but also their good hole-transporting properties.21

Conclusions
In summary, two simple
unsymmetrical AIEgens (PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz)
were prepared from commercially available, non-AIE reactants through
a facile synthetic route. These molecules showed red emission with
high solid quantum yields of 42.4 and 38.3%. They were thermally and
morphologically stable, and nondoped OLEDs using the neat films of
these AIEgens as emitting layers exhibited red electroluminescence
with maximum EQEs of 2.7 and 2.1%. Compared with the doped systems,
the nondoped ones show a lower turn-on voltage, a smaller roll-off,
and a lesser complexity in the fabrication process.22 This work hopefully will give more hints for molecular
structure design for red or even near-infrared OLEDs and provide a
promising strategy to fabricate OLEDs with better efficiency and stability.

spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorometer. High-resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 mass
spectrometer system operated in a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mode. Electrochemical measurements were
recorded on a CHI610D electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode
cell using a platinum button as the working electrode, a platinum
wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode as
the reference electrode in CHCl3/CH3CN (3:1,
v/v) with 0.1 M Bu4N+PF6– at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 and ferrocene as
the internal standard. Moreover, PLQY was determined by a Quanta-φ
integrating sphere. TGA measurements were carried out on a TA Q5000
instrument under a dry nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1. DSC analyses were performed on a TA Q1000
instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating (cooling) scan
rate of 10 °C min–1. Optimized geometric structures
in the gas phase of PN-BTZ-Cz and DP-BTZ-Cz were calculated at the
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured with
Hamamatsu Quantaurus-Tau C11367-11 at room temperature.

Device Fabrication
The devices were fabricated on clean
glass substrates precoated with a 180 nm thick layer of ITO with a
sheet resistance of 10 Ω per square. Prior to loading into the
pretreatment chamber, the ITO-coated glass substrates were soaked
in ultrasonic detergent for 100 min, followed by cleaning with deionized
water and oven-baking for 1 h at 120 °C. After treatment with
plasma for 15 min, they were dried for another 1 h. Organic layers
were deposited onto the ITO-coated substrates by high-vacuum (<5
× 10–4 Pa) thermal evaporation, consecutively
followed by hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN) (5 nm), 1,1-bis[4-bis(4-methylphenyl)aminophenyl]cyclohexane
(TAPC) (50 or 55 nm), 4,4′,4″-tris(carbazol-9-yl)-triphenylamine
(TCTA) (5 nm), emissive layer (20 nm), and 4,7-diphenyl,1,10-phenanthroline
(Bphen) (55 nm). Finally, a cathode composed of lithium fluoride and
aluminum was sequentially deposited onto the substrate in the vacuum
of 10–6 Torr. The current–voltage–brightness
characteristics were measured using a Keithley source measurement
unit (Keithley 2400 and Keithley 2000) with a calibrated silicon photodiode.
The EL spectra were measured by a Spectrascan PR650 spectrophotometer.
EQEs were calculated from the luminance, current density, and EL spectrum,
assuming a Lambertian distribution. All of the measurements were carried
out under ambient conditions.
