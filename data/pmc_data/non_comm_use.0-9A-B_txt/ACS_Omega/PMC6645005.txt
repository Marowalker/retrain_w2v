Photoredox catalysis
based on the [Cu(neo)(DPEphos)]BF4 copper complex allowed
getting a significant improvement of the
polymerization performances (e.g., thick samples, coatings...) compared
to that obtained with other benchmarked photoinitiators in both cationic
(CP) and free radical polymerizations (FRP). Nevertheless, as for
other copper complexes classically used as photoinitiators in polymer
science, the synthesis of these complexes is carried out in a solvent;
this fact remains an obstacle to their widespread use because of the
cost associated with the use of a solvent and the complex synthesis
procedure. In the present study, on the contrary, an outstanding efficient
mechanosynthesis of [Cu(neo)(DPEphos)]BF4—purity
≥95% outranking the previous Cu(I) mechanosynthesis—allowed
(i) to divide the synthesis time by 170-fold (as only 5 min is necessary
to get the complex), (ii) to lower the environmental impact and cut
the synthetic costs associated with solvent usage, and (iii) to access
a new Cu(I) complex with a counteranion that is impossible to introduce
under the traditional chemistry methods (e.g., I–). Reactivities of the mechanosynthesized copper complexes in resins
(FRP and CP) confirmed the very high purity of the obtained copper
complex by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

1 Introduction
Photoinitiated
free radical polymerization (FRP) and cationic polymerization
(CP) are techniques widely used in the industry for coatings, composites,
inks, paintings, dentistry, and so forth.1−8 The development of photoinitiating systems (PISs) that can be activated
with cheap and low-energy consumption light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
has opened new perspectives in this field.9 In parallel, photoredox catalysis was proposed as an efficient strategy
allowing to drastically reduce the amount of absorbing species in
the PIS by regeneration of the photoredox catalyst.10,11 In this frame, copper-based PISs that can be activated with visible
LEDs showed tremendous performances.12,13 Cu(I) bearing
one diphosphine ligand (bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]ether, noted
DPEphos) and one diamine ligand (neocuproine, noted neo) will be referred
as [Cu(neo)(DPEphos)]BF4. Particularly, as shown in Table 1, this [Cu(neo)(DPEphos)]BF4 complex (see the structure in Scheme 1; will be noted as G1) was very active in
thin films for FRP and CP under air, outperforming the bisacylphosphine
oxide (BAPO) PIS.14 Next, the production
of thick films (possible to obtain because a low amount of photoredox
catalyst is used) was performed in CP; the resulting polymers were
very stable toward thermolysis and hydrolysis, and these properties
were assigned to the density of the polymer network and the high degree
of conversion/cross-linking density (Table 1). Also, the introduction of a reducing agent
[tin(II) complex] to regenerate the catalyst enabled (i) the FRP of
low viscosity methacrylates upon sunlight irradiation, (ii) the full
photopolymerization beyond light exposure (lateral photopolymerization
>29 mm), and (iii) the complete curing of a 9 cm composite (45
wt
% fillers, full sample cured). More generally, copper complexes are
of outmost importance in many aspects of polymer science.15−22 In the present paper, we propose to directly grind the copper precursor
and the two ligands (see Scheme 1) to manually mechanosynthesize the G1 photoredox catalyst
to enhance the easiness for its access.

Grinding
or mechanosynthesis is a technique that was particularly
used in the eighties.28 With regard to
the pressing environmental issues in organic and inorganic chemistry, mechanosynthesis has received rather
recently a strong revival of interest.29,30 The mechanosynthesis
of metal complexes consists in grinding together the metal precursor
and the associated ligands. Some studies have shown that the maximum
energy present during grinding processes are in the range of 95 −112
kJ·mol–1, corresponding approximately to temperatures
in solution of 90 °C (same mixing times).31,32 The excellent review by Do and Friščić31 provides an overview of the different advantages
of the mechanosynthetic routes, which are as follows: (i) no need
of solvents at all (no emissions of volatile organic compounds and
no solvent costs), (ii) no purification costs, and (iii) access to
“impossible” compounds in solutions, that is, cannot
be synthesized by use of traditional synthetic methods. Mechanosynthesis
of copper complexes was recently studied by Kato and co-workers,30,33,34 but they had to use drops of
solvents (also referred as solvent-assisted mechanochemistry29), and the yields remained below 65%. Very few
studies used mechanosynthesized products in polymer science.35−37 During the last year, our group reported two studies making use
of mechanosynthesized copper complexes as redox FRP catalysts.38,39 However, the efficiency of the mechanosynthesis remained below 60%
in the two cases (as in the literature).

Taking into account
(i) the limitations/opportunities of mechanochemistry
and (ii) the high interest of the G1 copper complex in photopolymerization,
in the current study, we propose to mechanosynthesize the G1 complex
from Cu(I) precursors bearing different counteranions (PF6–, BF4–, and I–), as presented in Scheme 1: M-G1-P, M-G1-B, and M-G1-I. It is noteworthy
that M-G1-I corresponds to the synthesis of a copper complex (with
the iodide counteranion), which is impossible to realize in solution
because of the insolubility of copper iodide in most of the common
organic solvents. After characterization of the mechanosynthesized
complex by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 31P NMR) spectroscopy and high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), the reactivity
of the G1-based PIS was examined in light-assisted FRP, CP, and dual
FRP/CP.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemical
Compounds
All reactants
were used as received, and their structures are gathered in Scheme 1. Tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I)
tetrafluoroborate (Cu(ACN)4BF4), tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I)
hexafluorophosphate (Cu(ACN)4PF6), tin 2-ethylhexanoate (tin(II)), copper(I) iodide (CuI), and neocuproine
(neo) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. (Oxydi-2,1-phenylene)-bis(diphenylphosphine)
(DPEphos) and N-vinylcarbazole (NVK) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Di-tert-butyldiphenyl iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Iod) was
obtained from Lambson Ltd. Deuterated chloroform was obtained from
Eurisotop.

The efficiency of the different redox systems was
checked in a model methacrylate mixture (see Scheme 2) with a low viscosity of 0.053 Pa·s
containing 33.3 wt % 1,4-butanediol-dimethacrylate, 33.3 wt % hydroxypropylmethacrylate,
and 33.3 wt % urethane-dimethacrylate monomer (Sigma-Aldrich). The
efficiency of the different redox cationic initiating systems was
checked in (3,4-epoxycyclohexane)methyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate
(EPOX), which was obtained from Allnex (UVacure 1500).

2.2 Synthesis
of the Copper Complexes
2.2.1 Mechanosynthesis Protocols
Contrary
to the previous mechanosynthesis of copper complexes30,33,40 where drops of solvents were
added during and after the grinding procedure, no solvent at all was
used in this study. First, 0.05 mmol CuX [Cu(ACN)4BF4, Cu(ACN)4PF6, or CuI] and 1 equivalent of DPEphos
were grinded in an agate mortar (VWR) with an agate pestle. The resulting
solid was then grinded with 1 equivalent of neocuproine (neo) and
analyzed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 31P NMR spectroscopies and HR-ESI-MS. The grinding times are described
in the Results and Discussion section.

2.2.2 Synthesis of G1 in Solvent
The
synthesis of S-G1-B was performed according to procedures already
reported in the literature.12 The solvent
used for the synthesis is dichloromethane (DCM, 14 h stirring in total)
for the ligand exchange and pentane for the precipitation of G1.

2.3 HR-ESI-MS
Mass spectroscopy was performed
by the Spectropole at Aix-Marseille University. ESI mass spectral
analyses were recorded with a 3200 QTRAP (Applied Biosystems SCIEX)
mass spectrometer. The HRMS analysis was performed with a QStar Elite
(Applied Biosystems SCIEX) mass spectrometer. M-G1-X (X = PF6–, I– or BF4–) was first dissolved in 450 μL of DCM and then diluted at
1/103 in a methanol solution containing 0.1 mM NaCl. This
solution was subsequently introduced in the ionization source at a
flow rate of 10 μL/min. Commercial polyethylene glycol (PEG600)
was used as the internal standard. Raw HR-ESI-MS data are given in Table S1; they are summarized with the error
between experimental and theoretical data in Table 3.

2.4 1H and 31P NMR
1H and 31P NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 solution on a 300 MHz Varian Mercury
spectrometer.

2.5 Photopolymerization Monitoring
through Real
Time Fourier transform infrared (RT-FTIR) Spectroscopy (Figures 2 and 3)
A Jasco 6600 RT-FTIR spectrometer was used to record the
C=C double bond conversion and epoxide conversion versus time.
The evolution of the near-infrared (NIR) methacrylate C=C double
bond peak followed at about 6170 cm–1. The evolution
of the epoxide peak followed at the vibration around 3730 cm–1. Both NIR absorption polymerization monitoring techniques are widely
applied in the polymerization science.3,9,10 LED@405 nm (Thorlabs; light intensity from 35 to
200 mW/cm2 at the sample surface) was used for the photopolymerization
experiments. The emission spectrum is already available in the literature.9,41 All experiments were carried out at room temperature under air.
The equivalence in copper takes into account the different counteranion
and ACN molecular weights, but they do not consider the purity of
the complexes.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Solvent-Free Synthesis of G1
The
grinding procedure is described in Scheme 3. Copper(I) precursors [Cu(ACN)4BF4 or Cu(ACN)4PF6 or CuI] were first grinded with
the DPEphos ligand in reaction r1. DPEphos was selected as the first
ligand to be introduced because of its bulkiness impeding the coordination
of two ligands onto the metal center. On the opposite, the coordination
of two neocuproine ligands onto the Cu(I) center is well-established
in the literature. One can see in Figure 1B that for the mechanosynthesis of M-G1-I,
it took around 4 min to obtain a homogeneous powder after r1; for
the M-G1-B mechanosynthesis, it took only about 1 min. For the coordination
of the second ligand (neo, see reaction r2) in M-G1-B, the ligand
addition occurred almost immediately after the beginning of the grinding
as soon as a yellowish color appeared in the mortar. A similar strategy
was applied for M-G1-P (see Figure S1).
To have a completely yellow-orange color, it took about 5 min for
both M-G1-P and M-G1-B. For copper iodide (CuI), the grinding time
was longer (about 30 min in total) and stopped only when the yellow
color was homogeneous.

Scheme 3 Mechanosynthesis Route Proposed to Get M-G1-X Starting
From CuX [X
= I– or (ACN)4BF4– or (ACN)4PF6–]. Structures
Given in Scheme 1
To summarize (Table 2), we prepared M-G1-B, M-G1-I,
and M-G1-P by mechanosynthesis of
G1 using BF4–, I–,
and PF6– counteranions, respectively.
We also used the solvent-synthesized G1 as the reference. It bears
a BF4– counteranion: I will be noted
S-G1-B. The color of the mechanosynthesized powders was orange for
M-G1-P and M-G1-B, whereas yellow powders were obtained for S-G1-B
and M-G1-I. When dissolved into a solvent, all complexes exhibited
the characteristic yellow color of G1. The slightly orange color of
M-G1-P and M-G1-B in powder was assigned to the presence of remaining
traces of ACN [present in the initial copper(I) precursors]; these
traces can be removed when the synthesis of these complexes is carried
out in solution, the solvent being removed during the work-up. More
importantly, for the present study, the reaction time for the complete
synthesis of G1 was divided by a factor of 170! Indeed, M-G1-B is
mechanosynthesized in about 5 min whereas 14 h are required for the
synthesis of S-G1-B carried out in a solvent. Similarly, M-G1-P is
accessible in about 4 min 30 s. As estimated from the 1H NMR integration of the remaining neo-free ligand versus the same
proton peak in G1, the purities of M-G1-B (≥95%) and of M-G1-P
(91% and ≥95%) were outstandingly high (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). These reaction yields
outperform—to the best of our knowledge—the yields previously
reported for the mechanosynthesis of other copper complexes: (i) without
any drops of solvent, about 60% yield was obtained for Cu(acac) (2dppba)39 and (ii) when drops of solvents were added to
the solvent-assisted mechanosynthesis of copper complexes,30,33,38,40 the yield was always below 65% [e.g., 60% for [Cu2(CH3CN)2(dpypp)2](BF4)230 or 47% for CuBr(PPh3)2(4-Mepy).33 We attributed this
performance to the specific use of these two bidentate ligands having
a strong affinity for the Cu(I) center.

al.12

In the case of M-G1-I, the purity of the complex was still high
(between 70 and 72%) though lower than that obtained for M-G1-B and
M-G1-P. It can be assigned to the difficulty to dissociate the inorganic
ligand (I–) from the metal center that impedes the
coordination of the organic ligand. Nevertheless, the access to an
iodide-based copper complex is of very high interest. Copper iodide
is much cheaper than the other Cu(I) precursors. Also, importantly,
such a synthesis would not be possible in solution as it would require
very high temperatures to perform the ligand exchange.

In the
literature, repeatability of the mechanosynthesis has always
been discussed.30,33,38,40 Here, several syntheses were carried out,
and similar purities were obtained. Also, no purification procedure
at all was necessary for the obtained copper complexes, which significantly
increases the interest of the strategy (see performances in Table 2).

More characterizations
of the mechanosynthesis were performed,
as evidenced in Table 3. From 1H NMR, 13C
NMR, and 31P NMR spectra, all peaks characteristic of G1
(S-G1-B) were present in the mechanosynthesized products (M-G1-P and
M-G1-B). Even more importantly, HR-ESI-MS unambiguously confirmed
the presence of the G1 copper complexes with errors of less than 2
ppm for M-G1-P, M-G1-I, and M-G1-B molecular weights; the theoretical
molecular weight of 809.1906 Da was obtained for all these copper
(I) complexes.

3.2 Photoinitiating Efficiency for FRP, CP, and
Interpenetrating Polymer Network (IPN) Synthesis
Next, these
differently prepared G1 complexes were tested in photopolymerization
experiments (Figure 2). As M-G1-B and S-G1-B have the same counteranion,
it is possible to directly compare them in CP. In Figure 2A, it can be observed that
the kinetics for a G1/NVK/Iod system is almost exactly the same with
about 40% conversion obtained after 40 s upon a low irradiance LED@405
nm (curve 1 for M-G1-B vs curve 2 for S-G1-B). This could be ascribed
to the purity of M-G1-B that is very high (1H NMR data)
and competitive with that of S-G1-B. For M-G1-P and M-G1-I (also used
without further purifications), the comparisons with S-G1-B were performed
in photoinitiated FRP and are shown in Figure 2B. The counteranion is expected to have no
influence on G1 reactivity in photoFRP.12,14 Very low concentrations
of G1 and Iod were chosen to lower the reactivities, which will highlight
the potential effects of the purities of the copper complexes. The
kinetics for M-G1-P and S-G1-B were almost the same (80% C=C
conversion after 30 s), confirming the high purities observed in 1H NMR. For M-G1-I, the kinetics is slightly less favorable
with 75% conversion obtained after 100 s, confirming the 70% purity
obtained in Table 2 (lower effective G1 content). Nevertheless, this cheaper iodide-based
G1 can be used in combination with tin(II) (see catalytic cycle in
ref (25)) for an outstandingly
efficient photoinitiated FRP (15 s to reach 83% conversion).

(35 mW/cm2) for 0.8 wt % Iod and (1) 0.3 wt % M-G1-P or
(2) 1 equiv S-G1-B.

Then, in Figure 2C, the comparison between M-G1-P
(curve 1) and S-G1-B (curve 2) photoinitiating
efficiencies was carried out turning the LED irradiance to a very
low value of 35 mW/cm2. Indeed, when irradiances are lower,
the light absorbed intensity by the PIS (also referred as Iabs) is considerably lowered, which will enhance
the ratio between inhibitions (e.g., oxygen inhibition42,43) and initiating radical generations. Doing so, radical generation
rates (or photopolymerization efficiencies) will be even more sensitive
to impurities in the PIS. Very interestingly, the results appearing
in Figure 2B are confirmed
in Figure 2C: M-G1-P
and S-G1-B show exactly the same photoinitiating abilities, which
confirm the Cu(I) purities obtained by mechanosynthesis.

Finally,
the current report enables the study of new types of counteranions
of G1 in cationic photopolymerization. In Figure 3A, M-G1-P (not yet mentioned/accessed in the previous G1 studies)
was the best copper complex with 40% epoxide conversion after 40 s
(curve 3, Figure 3A).
Next, M-G1-B showed slightly slower kinetics (38% epoxide conversion
after 45 s, curve 2, Figure 3A) when M-G1-I was the less efficient copper complex (35%
conversion after 50 s, curve 1, Figure 3A). This order of reactivity was attributed to the
nucleophilicity of the counteranion: PF6– is less nucleophilic followed by BF4–; I– shows the highest nucleophilicity with a more
localized negative charge. Such a counteranion is likely to trap the
propagating cations. This effect of the counteranion is in line with
the well-known literature.44

equiv M-G1-P.

The access to M-G1-P
(new counteranion) also offers better performances
in the IPN synthesis: in Figure 3B, one can see that the kinetics for epoxide conversion
was greatly enhanced when comparing M-G1-P with S-G1-B; 10% epoxide
conversion after 75 s for S-G1-B (curve 2) when 17% epoxide conversion
is possible with M-G1-P (curve 1). The C=C conversion kinetics
was—logically—less affected by the change of the counteranion.
Tack-free polymers were obtained in both cases.

4 Conclusions
The mechanosynthesis of an outstandingly efficient
photoredox catalyst
for photopolymerization initiation is proposed. Very interestingly,
the mechanosynthesis of G1 was very efficient with more than 95% purity
(1H NMR data) when most of the copper complexes mechanosynthesized
previously had purities below 65%. FRP and CP photopolymerization
tests fully confirmed the purities encountered in the 1H NMR data. Also, the access to a new cheaper Cu(I) counteranion
was possible (I–). Interestingly, a G1-bearing PF6– counteranion was also prepared, which
can be very interesting in CP because of the lower nucleophilicity
of PF6–. The use of mechanosynthesis
for other PISs of high interest will be presented in forthcoming papers.
