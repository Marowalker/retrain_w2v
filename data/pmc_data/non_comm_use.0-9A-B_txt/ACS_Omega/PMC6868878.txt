Xanthan, a highly stable polysaccharide
which is not easily degraded by
most microorganisms, contains a cellulosic backbone with trisaccharide
side chains composed of mannosyl-glucuronyl-mannose attached α-1,3
to alternating glucosyl residues. Different digestion strategies were
first applied to demonstrate the complexity about the proteomes of Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan medium and glucose
medium. Significantly up-regulated proteins induced by xanthan were
screened out by the label-free quantitation of the proteomes of Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan medium and glucose
medium. Consequently, 2746 and 2878 proteins were identified in proteomes
of Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan
medium and glucose medium individually, which represent 80.6 and 84.4%
of total protein dataset predicted to be expressed by the gene. In
the list of 430 induced proteins containing the proteins specifically
expressed or up-regulated in xanthan medium, 19 proteins involved
in carbohydrate-active enzymes database and 38 proteins annotated
with transporter activity were critical in the degrading pathway of
xanthan. Four CAZymes (GH3, GH38, GH9, and PL8) and one ABC transporter
(LX1-1GL001097) were verified with quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction. Four CAZymes (GH3, GH38, GH9, and PL8) were further
verified with the enzyme assay. This study suggests a xanthan-degrading
pathway in Microbacterium sp. XT11,
and other potential xanthan degradation-related proteins still need
further investigation.

Introduction
Xanthan is an important
extracellular heteropolysaccharide produced
by a plant-pathogenic bacterium, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris.1 This polysaccharide has a cellulosic backbone with trisaccharide
side chains composed of mannosyl-glucuronyl-mannose attached α-1,3
to alternating glucosyl residues.2 The
internal mannosyl residues are acetylated and the terminal mannosyl
residues are pyruvated in the side chain, but the extent of modification
varies with xanthan-producing strains and culture conditions.3 Because of superior rheological properties, xanthan
has been widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and oil industry
as the thickener, gelling, and stabilizing agent.4−6

Interestingly,
xanthan is considered to play a key role in the
virulence of Xanthomonas bacterial
cells in causing black rot,7 but its degradation
product could inhibit X. campestris pv. campestris.8 Additionally, the xanthan with truncated side chain is
very useful in altering the viscosity of suspensions injected into
the underground oil-bearing formations.9 However, xanthan is a highly stable polysaccharide which is not
easily degraded by most microorganisms. Only a few of microorganisms
and related enzymes have been reported to participate in the depolymerization
of the polysaccharide.10−13 The first complete report on xanthan degradation by bacteria was
done by Nankai et al., in which an enzymatic route for the degradation
of xanthan in Bacillus sp. strain GL1
by analyzing the structures of xanthan depolymerization products was
elucidated.14

In our previous work,
an excellent xanthan-degrading bacterium Microbacterium sp. XT11 was isolated.15 Xanthan lyase
and endoxanthanase produced by Microbacterium sp. XT11 were purified and characterized.16,17 Yang et al. reported a high-quality complete genome sequence of
a xanthan-degrading bacterium Microbacterium sp. XT11, and four genes probably involved in xanthan-degradation
pathway were detected as a gene cluster in the genome.18 However, the proteins involved in the degradation
process of xanthan were not yet simultaneously analyzed. As we all
know, the defence response in plant cells mediated by elicitor molecules
could help plants to resist infective diseases.19 Xanthan is the most favorable carbon resource for both
the growth and enzyme production of Microbacterium sp. XT11. Some oligosaccharides of xanthan were confirmed to directly
inhibit Xanthomonas bacterium and be
elicitor-active that could induce the accumulation of phytoalexin
in the soybean cotyledon in our previous experiment.15 As the separation or the chemical synthesis of elicitor-active
oligosaccharide of xanthan was hard, the controllable enzymatic degradation
of xanthan may be an alternative method. Therefore, all the related
proteins involved in the degradation of xanthan were worth studying.

Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an essential tool in all biological
research, most remarkably by enabling the large-scale identification,
characterization, and quantification of proteins.20,21 MS-based proteomics is the systematic study of the many and diverse
properties of proteins in a parallel manner in biological systems.22 Currently, the shotgun proteomics strategy became
the first choice for identifying proteins in most large-scale studies,
which was based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing
them using tandem MS and automated database searching.23 Therefore, protein identification and proteome
sequence coverage can be efficiently improved by using multiple proteases
with complementary cleavage specificities.24,25 In our research, the digestion strategy with multiple proteases
was first applied to extend knowledge about the proteomes of Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan medium and glucose
medium. Then, the differential analysis of the proteomes of Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan medium and glucose
medium was carried out by the label-free quantitation (LFQ) strategy
to explore the significantly changed proteins induced by xanthan.
All the induced proteins related with xanthan biodegradation were
referenced for GO-annotation and carbohydrate-active enzymes database
(CAZy) to find out carbohydrate-active enzymes and proteins with transporter
activity, which was critical in the xanthan-degrading pathway. Finally,
the selected proteins were further verified with quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme assay.

Results and Discussion
Microbacterium sp. XT11 Grew
Well in Xanthan Medium and Glucose Medium
Microbacterium sp. XT11 was identified as the bacteria
capable of fragmenting xanthan. It was confirmed that various carbohydrates
used as carbon sources supported the growth of strain XT11.15 Therefore, the proteins related with xanthan
bio-degradation may be induced by xanthan. As shown in Figure 1, strain XT11 grew well when
cultured in xanthan medium and the cell mass (OD600) can
be up to 4. It took less than 25 h to reach the stationary phase.
The bacteria also grew well with glucose as the carbon source in medium
and the cell mass (OD600) was up to 3 when the stationary
phase was reached within 12 h. Hence, the proteomes of strain XT11
when cultured in xanthan medium and glucose medium were compared to
investigate the proteins related with xanthan biodegradation. The
proteome of strain XT11 when cultured in glucose medium was used as
the control experiment.

Multiple Protease Digestion Revealed the Complicated Proteomes
of Microbacterium sp. XT11
Considering the fact that amino acids composition varied among different
proteins, proteases with different cleavage specificity can be applied
to increase the sequence coverage of protein analysis. As chymotrypsin
has complementary cleavage specificity to trypsin, it can be expected
that many proteins which cannot be identified by trypsin digestion
are possibly to be identified by chymotrypsin digestion. In addition,
the combined use of trypsin and chymotrypsin not only efficiently
takes advantage of the complementary cleavages of chymotrypsin relative
to trypsin but also improves the identification of the long peptide.
Therefore, the proteins expressed by strain XT11 in xanthan medium
and glucose medium which were designated as proteome I and II, respectively,
were all analyzed by using three different digestion strategies (trypsin,
chymotrypsin, and trypsin and chymotrypsin) (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Work flow for analysis of the xanthan-degrading
bacterium Microbacterium sp. XT11 proteome
and the induced
proteins related with xanthan bio-degradation.

Both proteome I and II can be divided into two parts: one was identified
from whole cell lysate (cell protein) and another was identified in
the medium with the signal peptide (extracellular protein). Secretory
signal peptides were predicted by the SignalP 4.1 server.26 For cell protein, trypsin digestion led to the
identification of 2084 and 2022 proteins in proteome I and II individually,
while the total number of identified proteins reached 2553 and 2684
by using other two digestion strategies (Figure 3A,C). For extracellular protein, 143 and
146 proteins were detected by using trypsin digestion in proteome
I and II, respectively, while, in total, 193 and 194 proteins were
detected combined with other two digestion strategies (Figure 3B,D). The number increased
by 22.5, 32.7, 35.0, and 32.9%, individually. As described by Biringer
et al., combining data from two individual digests produced by different
proteases significantly enhanced the overall sequence coverage for
most cerebrospinal fluid proteins and aided in protein identification.24 Our results further supported that the use of
complementary proteases improved the proteome coverage remarkably.
Totally, 3409 genes of Microbacterium sp. XT11 were sequenced. Combining the data of two parts, 2746 and
2878 proteins were identified in proteome I and II individually, which
represented 80.6 and 84.4% of total protein dataset expressed by the
gene. The large proportion of identification in total protein dataset
confirmed the reliability of our experiment.

extracellular protein in proteome I (B) and II (D) by using three

Label-Free Quantification Strategy Explored the Induced Proteins
Related with Xanthan Biodegradation
As mentioned above, 229
and 361 proteins were specifically expressed individually in the identified
2746 and 2878 proteins of proteome I and II (detailed information
of 229 and 361 proteins were listed in the Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). These proteins were
either identified in proteome I or in proteome II, so these proteins
were specific proteins closely related with culture medium. Apart
from these specific proteins, proteins highly expressed when cultured
in xanthan medium relative to glucose medium were also considered
as induced proteins related with xanthan biodegradation. Therefore,
the LFQ strategy based on the analysis of the peak area of precursor
ions, which did not have a time-consuming step of isotopic labeling,27 was applied to comparatively analyze the proteomes
of Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan
medium and glucose medium, to explore the significantly up-regulated
proteins induced by xanthan. LC/MS/MS results of three biological
replicates were merged together for LFQ analysis. When the expression
level of a protein showed a twofold change in abundance compared to
the control (q < 0.05), the protein was considered
to be significantly up-regulated. The ratios were described as abundance
ratios (proteome I/proteome II). When Microbacterium sp. XT11 in glucose medium was considered as the control, Microbacterium sp. XT11 in xanthan medium displayed
179 higher expression cell proteins and 36 higher expression extracellular
proteins (detailed information of 179 and 36 proteins were listed
in the Tables S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information). Considering the fact that low abundance protein cannot be stably
identified in each run of MS, the proteins specifically expressed
or up-regulated when cultured in xanthan medium by removing the redundant
proteins in these two parts were considered as the induced proteins
related with xanthan biodegradation. Finally, 430 proteins were classified
as the induced proteins related with xanthan biodegradation.

To reveal the main functions of the induced proteins related with
xanthan biodegradation, these proteins of which 251 were GO-annotated
were categorized functionally into three large groups including molecular
functions, biological processes, and cellular components by using
the WEGO (Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot) web service (http://wego.genomics.org.cn/).28 As shown in Figure 4, these GO-annotated proteins were distributed
among 24 subgroups, in which each of the categories of “catalytic
activity”, “binding”, “cellular process”
and “metabolic process” contained more than 30% proteins.
In contrast, relatively few proteins (more than 10% proteins) were
contained in the categories of “cell part”, “cell”,
“membrane”, “transporter activity”, “transcription
regulator activity”, “localization”, “biological
regulation”, and “regulation of biological process”.
Apart from abovementioned categories, other categories displayed very
few proteins.

Figure 4 Bar graph showing the distribution of the percentage of
GO-annotated
protein with cellular component, molecular function and biological
process. Exactly as some proteins have multiple subcellular locations,
a great number of proteins are associated with diverse molecular functions
and involved in various biological processes. Therefore, the sum of
all the subcategories with GO annotation must exceed 100%.

Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes and Proteins with Transporter Activity
Played Critical Roles in Xanthan-Degrading Process
Considering
the fact that the complete degradation of xanthan needs both the intracellular
and extracellular enzymatic process, carbohydrate-active enzymes and
proteins with transporter activity should be critical in the process.
Therefore, all the induced proteins related with xanthan bio-degradation
were referenced for GO-annotation and CAZy to find out carbohydrate-active
enzymes and proteins with transporter activity. For the novel proteins
without functional annotation, their functions were referred to the
highly homologous protein (>95%) which was sought out by blasting
in the existed database with the amino acid sequences of proteins.29 In the induced protein list, 19 proteins were
involved in CAZy and 38 proteins were annotated with transporter activity
(Table 1).

GH3 was expressed as cell
protein and 21.6 times more in proteome
I than in proteome II. GH38 which was responsible for hydrolysis of
disaccharide to mannose and glucose was also detected to be increased
4.9-fold. GH9 and PL8 which were both detected with a signal peptide
were 68.6 and 27.4 times individually more in proteome I than in proteome
II. Obviously, GH3, GH9, GH38, and PL8 which can be cooperative to
depolymerize xanthan from pentasaccharide to disaccharide were highly
expressed when xanthan was supplemented in the medium.

We have
previously confirmed the function of PL8 in the xanthan-degrading
pathway that PL8 (xanthan lyase, protein ID LX1-1GL001102) was specific
on the pyruvated mannosyl residue in the intact xanthan molecule.17 GH9 (endoglucanase, protein ID LX1-1GL001095)
was newly characterized as endo-type xanthanase efficiently and randomly
cleaving glucosidic bonds within the backbone of highly ordered xanthan,
of which the specific activity on xanthan was significantly higher
than other known GH9 cellulases on CMC.30 Additionally, the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) in extracellular
enzymes (GH9 and PL8) could specifically recognize and bind to xanthan
chains, leading to subsequent degradation of xanthan, when XT11 was
cultured in xanthan medium.17,30

An ATP-binding
cassette (ABC)-type sugar transport complex (protein
ID LX1-1GL001097, LX1-1GL001098, LX1-1GL001099) was reported to be
located in the cluster with four CAZymes and presumably plays a role
in transporting oligosaccharides into cells.18,31 In our research, LX1-1GL001097 was detected with a signal peptide
and was 100 times more in proteome I than in proteome II. Meanwhile,
LX1-1GL001098 was detected in the cell part and its amount increased
100 times when xanthan was supplemented. However, LX1-1GL001099 was
detected as cell protein only with chymotrypsin as the protease. As
the frequencies of lysine and arginine appeared in LX1-1GL001099 were
low and their distributions were uneven among the sequence of amino
acids, the mass of tryptic peptides rarely fell into the scan range
of MS. Therefore, LX1-1GL001099 was not quantified by tryptic digestion.

These four CAZymes and an ABC-type sugar transport complex were
found to be located in a cluster under the control of a transcriptional
regulator in Microbacterium sp. XT11.18 Moreover, the structures of xanthan depolymerization
products were determined by Nankai et al.14 Therefore, we suggested a xanthan-degrading pathway in Microbacterium sp. XT11 according to the abovementioned
results of proteomic analysis. The variation trend and subcellular
location of four CAZymes and two ABC transporters supported the putative
xanthan-degrading pathway in Microbacterium sp. XT11 that xanthan was extracellularly degraded to tetrasaccharides,
then transported into cells through ABC-transporters, finally intracellularly
cleaved into glucose, mannose, and glucuronate (Figure 5). This suggested that the xanthan-degrading
pathway was in accordance with the enzymatic route for the depolymerization
of xanthan in Bacillus sp. strain GL1
represented by Nankai et al.,14 but the
ABC-transporters participated in xanthan-degrading pathway were first
detected. Moreover, these four CAZymes and an ABC-type sugar transport
complex were not only identified by proteomic analysis but also confirmed
as induced proteins when cultured in xanthan medium by quantitative
results.

Figure 5 Schematic diagram showing a pathway for xanthan degradation and
proteomic fold changes observed for all the catalytic enzymes and
ABC-type sugar transporters.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR and Enzyme Assay-Verified MS Analysis
To verify the MS screening results, we first measured the expression
of 4 CAZymes (GH3, GH38, GH9, PL8) and 1 ABC transporter (LX1-1GL001097)
in strain XT11 which was cultured in xanthan medium or glucose medium
at the mRNA level using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown
in Figure 6, the expression
of GH3, GH38, GH9, PL8, and ABC was remarkably higher when cultured
in xanthan medium than in glucose medium, which displayed the same
tendency as indicated by the proteomic quantitative results (Supporting Information Table S5). As previously
reported, MS analysis results were verified with quantitative real-time
PCR.32

Figure 6 Bar graph showing the validation of proteomics
screening results
with qRT-PCR.

To further verify MS results,
the functions of four CAZymes (GH3,
GH38, GH9, and PL8) in the cluster were investigated. After heterologous
expression and purification, the specific activity of GH3 toward pNPG,
GH38 against pNP-α-d-man, GH9 and PL8 toward xanthan
was 83.10 ± 2.23 U/g, 95.10 ± 11.06 U/g, 54.61 ± 6.12
U/g, 12.74 ± 0.13, respectively (Supporting Information Table S6, Figure S1), whereas when Bacillus sp. strain
GL1 which is the first complete reported on xanthan degradation was
cultured in xanthan medium, the activities of GH38, GH9, and PL8 were
0.060, 0.002, and 0.050 U/mL, respectively.3,12,14 Therefore, compared with Bacillus sp. strain GL1, Microbacterium sp. XT11 showed greater xanthan-degrading ability. Meanwhile, the
activities of four CAZymes in Microbacterium sp. XT11 cultured in xanthan medium and glucose medium were determined.
When the strain XT11 was cultured in xanthan medium, the activities
of GH3, GH38, GH9, and PL8 increased by 18.5-, 3.2-, 16.9-, and 2.5-folds
(Figure 7), respectively,
as compared with that in the glucose culture, indicating that all
these four CAZymes in cluster were significantly induced by xanthan.
All the results supported that these four CAZymes located in the same
cluster should play a critical role the xanthan-degrading pathway
in Microbacterium sp. XT11.

Figure 7 Bar graph showing
the enzyme activity fold of 4 CAZymes (GH3, GH38,
GH9, PL8) detected in xanthan medium. The enzyme activity of 4 CAZymes
(GH3, GH38, GH9, PL8) detected in glucose medium was set as control
to be 1.

Conclusions
Using
three different digestion strategies (trypsin, chymotrypsin,
trypsin and chymotrypsin), 2746 and 2878 proteins were identified
in proteomes of Microbacterium sp.
XT11 in xanthan medium and glucose medium individually, which represented
80.6 and 84.4% of total protein dataset expressed by the gene. Combining
the up-regulated proteins quantified by the LFQ strategy and specifically
expressed proteins in the xanthan medium, 430 proteins were considered
as induced proteins related with xanthan biodegradation. Among these
proteins, 19 proteins involved in CAZy and 38 proteins annotated with
transporter activity were of potential significance in the degrading
pathway of xanthan. Four CAZymes (GH3, GH38, GH9, and PL8) and one
ABC transporter (LX1-1GL001097) were further verified with quantitative
real-time PCR. Enzyme assay results of four CAZymes (GH3, GH38, GH9,
and PL8) further supported the suggested xanthan-degrading pathway
in Microbacterium sp. XT11. Finally,
the knock-out of key enzymes or transporters will be carried out in
our future work for in-depth investigation of the xanthan degrading
pathway, and other identified induced proteins involved in CAZy or
annotated with transporter activity were also needed for further investigation
of their exact effect in the xanthan-degrading pathway.

purchased from Sigma (USA). Chemical reagents of iodacetamine (IAA),
1, 4-dithiothreitol (DTT), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and formic
acid (FA) were obtained from Sigma (USA). Water, acetonitrile, and
methanol (optima-LC/MS grade) were obtained from Fisher Scientific

with 30 μm of particle were purchased from Waters (USA). Steritop-GP
filter units (0.22 μm) were obtained from Millipore (USA). The
BCA protein quantitation kit was obtained from Beyotime Biotechnology

Microorganism
and Culture Conditions
Microbacterium sp. XT11 was revived from cryo-preserved
stocks stored at −80 °C and grew on Luria–Bertani
(LB) agar plates. The single colony was inoculated into LB broth at
30 °C for 24 h. Then, the seed culture was transferred into xanthan
medium and glucose medium, respectively. Microbacterium sp. XT11 was cultured in the xanthan medium at 30 °C as described
elsewhere.15 The xanthan medium consists
of (per liter) 3 g of xanthan and 1 g of yeast extract in the mineral
salt solution. The mineral salt solution contains (per liter) 250
mg of K2HPO4, 400 mg of NaCl, 125 mg of MgSO4·7H2O, and 350 mg of KNO3, and
pH 7.0. 3 g glucose was used as the carbon source in place of xanthan
in glucose medium.

Protein Extraction
Three batches
of Microbacterium sp. XT11 were cultured
for biological
replicates. Microbacterium sp. XT11
started from the same frozen inoculum were cultured in the xanthan
medium and glucose medium. Cultures for proteomic analysis were harvested
at the middle of the exponential growth stage because xanthan solution
was degraded obviously with significant decrease of viscosity in this
period. The cell pellet was collected as cell fraction by centrifuging
twice (5500g, 4 °C, 30 min). The supernatants
were combined and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane to obtain
a cell-free fraction. Aliquots of 100 mL were processed using the
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method for proteomics analysis as follows.
In brief, 100 mL of cell-free medium with 10 mL 100% (w/v) TCA added
was vortexed for 15 s. After cooling in ice for at least 15 min, the
mixture was centrifuged at 14 000g for 10
min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was
washed twice with acetone and resuspended with buffer I (8 M urea
+ 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The protein concentration was determined
by the BCA method and the resuspended sample was reserved at 80 °C
for digestion.

For determining total protein production separately
in the presence of xanthan or glucose, 50 mg (wet weight) of the cell
pellet was washed thrice with PBS and resuspended in buffer II (8
M urea + 50 mM Tris-HCl + 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). Then, the cell
pellet was disrupted by an ultrasonic cell discrupter (3 s with 3
s intervals for 180 times at 400 w). Finally, the supernatant was
collected by centrifuging at 14 000g for 10
min at 4 °C and the concentration of proteins was determined
by BCA assay.

Protein Digestion
Proteins (1 mg)
in buffer I or buffer
II was reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 20 mM IAA as previously
reported.33 Furthermore, the sample was
diluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl and added with different enzymes (trypsin,
chymotrypsin, or trypsin and chymotrypsin) with an enzyme to protein
mass ratio of 1:50. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the
mixture was desalted by Oasis HLB cartridges and the eluate was lyophilized
to dryness.

MS Analysis
After the lyophilized
peptides were dissolved
in 0.1% FA, the sample was loaded onto a reversed-phase μ-precolumn
(C18PepMap100, 5 μm, 100 Å) and peptide separation was
performed using a reversed-phase Acclaim PepMap RSLC analytical column
(50 μm × 15 cm, 2 μm, 100 Å) by the Ultimate
3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex, USA) with a 200 nL/min flow rate. All
the tests were performed in triplicate. The mobile phase was 0.1%
FA/H2O (A) and 80% ACN/0.1%FA/20% H2O (B). For
better separation, a gradient elution mode was used. The gradient
set is as follows: 0 min, 4% B; 3 min, 10% B; 25 min, 35% B; 31 min,
55% B; 32 min, 95% B; 42 min, 95% B; 43 min, 4% B.

The resulting
peptides were subjected to the nanoESI source followed by tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) in Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
coupled online to the UPLC. Intact peptides and ion fragments were
detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70 000 and 17 500
individually. Full-scan MS was acquired from m/z 350 to 1800. The MS/MS spectra were acquired in the data-dependent
mode. The 15 most intense ions were selected for MS/MS with an automatic
gain control target of 3 × 106. Normalized collision
energy (27%) was used for the peptides selected for MS/MS. Ions (1
× 105) were accumulated for generation of MS/MS spectra.
Dynamic exclusion was set as 30.0 s. The electrospray voltage applied
was 2.5 kV.

Data Analysis
The resulting MS/MS
data were processed
using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388) with Sequent HT as the
search engine. Tandem mass spectra were searched against DNA sequencing
database of Microbacterium sp. XT11
(3409 sequences) concatenated with reverse decoy database. The false
detection rate values for peptide identifications were controlled
less than 1%. Trypsin (chymotrypsin, or trypsin and chymotrypsin)
was specified as the cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missing cleavages.
Mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment
ions. The minimum peptide length was set as 6 and maximum 144. Carbamidomethylation
on Cys (+57.021 Da) was specified as static modification. Oxidation
on Met (+15.995 Da) and acetylation on protein N-terminal (+42.011
Da) were set as dynamic modifications.

Total RNA Extraction and
Real-Time PCR
RNA was extracted
from strain XT11 cultured in xanthan medium or glucose medium using
RNAiso Plus according to manufacturer’s instruction (TaKaRa
Bio, Japan). Totally 100 ng RNA was reverse-transcribed using the
PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRaBio, Japan). The
reverse transcription product was diluted to one-tenth and used as
the template for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with TaKaRa
PCR Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TaKaRa Code. TP800). To
normalize the cycle threshold values, the relative transcript level
for 16S rDNA was determined. The condition used for qRT-PCR is as
follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, and
60 °C for 30 s. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table 2.

Heterologous
Expression and Purification of Xanthan Degrading-Related
Enzymes
Coding genes of GH3, GH38, GH9, and PL8 were amplified
by PCR using the genomic DNA template extracted from Microbacterium sp. XT11 and ligated into the pET28a
vector as described before.17,30 The resulted recombinant
plasmids were then transformed into electrocompetent E. coli BL21 (DE3) by electroporation. The recombinants
were selected on LB plates containing 100 mg/L kanamycin. For induction,
IPTG was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cells were
further cultured at 16 °C for 12 h. Cells were disrupted by ultrasonic
treatment. Following removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the
supernatant was ready for subsequent purification. His-tagged GH3,
GH38, GH9, and PL8 were respectively purified using a Ni-NTA purification
system as described before.34

Enzyme Assay
For extracellular enzymes, the culture
supernatant was used as crude enzyme solution. For intracellular enzymes,
cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was suspended
and sonicated using an ultrasonic processor (Branson Digital Sonifier;
Branson, USA). Following removal of cell debris by centrifugation,
the supernatant was ready for subsequent enzyme assay. For heterologously
expressed enzymes, purified proteins were assayed.

The specific
activity of the endoglucanase was determined by incubating 5 g/L xanthan
with crude enzyme solution in 10 mM NaH2PO4–Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was conducted
at 40 °C for 20 min and then terminated by boiling the mixture
for 5 min. The liberation of reducing end sugars was assayed by the
2, 2′-bicinchoninate method. One unit of enzyme activity was
defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol reducing
end sugar per min.

The activity of xanthan lyase was assayed
in the reaction mixture
containing 0.5 g/L xanthan in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
6.0) and appropriately diluted crude enzyme solution. After incubation
at 40 °C for 10 min, the increase in the absorbance at 235 nm
was determined. One unit of xanthan lyase activity was defined as
the amount of enzyme that produced an increase of 1.0 in the absorbance
at 235 nm per min under the above condition.

To measure the
activity of beta-glucosidase toward p-nitrophenyl
β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG), the reaction
mixture containing 2.5 mM pNPG and appropriately diluted crude enzyme
in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were incubated for 10 min
at 40 °C and stopped by the addition of 0.5 mL of 1 M Na2CO3. The absorbance of the mixture was measured
at 405 nm. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount to
liberate 1 μM of p-nitrophenol (pNP) per min
under the assay conditions.

The activity of alpha-mannosidase
toward p-nitrophenyl
a-d-mannopyranoside (pNP-α-d-man) was measured
by incubating 0.4 mM pNP-α-d-man and appropriately
diluted crude enzyme in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The
reaction was carried out at 40 °C for 10 min and then terminated
by adding 0.4 mL of 0.25 M Na2CO3. The absorbance
at 405 nm was determined. One unit of enzyme activity was defined
as the amount to liberate 1 μM of p-nitrophenol
(pNP) per min under the assay conditions.

All the assays were
conducted in triplicate, and the mean values
were presented.
