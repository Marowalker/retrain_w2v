State-of-the-art
catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions
(ORR and OER), which form the basis of advanced fuel cell applications,
are based on noble metals such as Pt and Ir. However, high cost and
scarcity of noble metals have led to an increased demand of earth-abundant
metal oxide catalysts, especially for bifunctional activity in ORR
and OER. The fact that Pt and Ir or C, the cost-effective alternatives
suggested, do not display satisfactory bifunctional activity has also
helped in turning the interest to metal oxides which are stable under
both ORR and OER conditions. Brownmillerite A2B2O5 type oxides are promising as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts
because of intrinsic structural features, viz., oxygen vacancy and
catalytic activity of the B-site transition metal. In this study,
Co-doped Ca2Fe2O5 compounds are synthesized
by the solid state method and structurally analyzed by Rietveld refinement
of powder X-ray diffraction data. The compound Ca2Fe2O5, crystallizing in the Pcmn space
group has alternative FeO4 tetrahedral and FeO6 octahedral layers. Its Co-doped analogue, Ca2Fe1.75Co0.25O5, also crystallizes in the same space
group with both tetrahedral and octahedral Fe positions substituted
with Co. However, Ca2FeCoO5 in the Pbcm space group shows interlayer ordering with Co-rich octahedra connected
to Fe-rich tetrahedra and vice versa. Oxygen bifunctional activities
of these catalysts are monitored by rotating disc electrode and rotating
ring disc electrode techniques in alkaline media. A close analysis
of the ORR and OER was conducted through comparison of various parameters
such as onset potential, current density, halfwave potential, and
other kinetic parameters, which suggests that the presence of Co in
the B site aids in achieving better bifunctional activity and bulk
conductivity. In addition, Co(II)/Co(III) redox systems and their
comparative concentrations also play a decisive role in enhancing
the activity.

Introduction
Oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
are the two fundamental electrochemical reactions in fuel cells and
energy storage devices, which are gaining renewed attention because
of the thrust in sustainable energy production. In ORR, strong double
bonds have to be broken for the formation of hydroxyl or peroxide
ions from oxygen molecule and vice versa is true for OER, both reactions
involving four electrons. Hence, they are often described as sluggish
compared to their anodic counterparts, viz., hydrogen evolution and
oxidation which are two electron processes.1,2 It
is therefore necessary that the catalysts used for ORR and OER are
highly active for achieving better performance parameters of the devices.
A novel concept which has emerged recently evokes catalysts which
are simultaneously active for both ORR and OER in a bifunctional mode.
Such bifunctional catalysts can be applied in advanced energy systems
such as unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC), and metal–air
batteries.3 A URFC is a combination of
an electrolyzer and fuel cell, providing high energy densities, where
OER and ORR form the base reactions in the individual components,
respectively. In metal–air batteries, OER and ORR occur in
the same device, while charging and discharging, respectively. There
are severe challenges in using conventional noble metal catalysts,
that is, Pt for ORR and IrO2 or RuO2 for OER,
in a bifunctional mode in these energy systems as IrO2 and
RuO2 are not active for ORR and Pt forms a surface oxide
layer under OER conditions, which affects its durability. Any combinations
or alloys of these noble metals would render the catalyst prohibitively
expensive. Other less expensive alternatives suggested are carbon-based
materials, which, even though abundant and cheap, corrode in the OER
experimental conditions because of rapid oxidation of carbon to CO2. In this scenario, transition-metal oxides from earth-abundant
elements present an interesting substitute because of high stability
in oxidative environments4 and cost effectiveness.
Hence, structured oxides, such as perovskites, spinels, and so forth,
synthesized from first-row transition metals, which are structurally
conducive for manipulations to enhance various electronic and structural
properties such as oxygen vacancies, have garnered attention lately.5

Strategies like doping can be adopted in
the perovskite structure
to induce redox couple formation increasing its bulk conductivity.
Another important consequence of doping is creation of defect structures
through oxygen vacancies which in turn result in excellent oxygen
ion mobility and exchange kinetics.6 Oxygen
vacancies can directly influence the electrochemical oxygen reduction
and evolution activities of the catalyst, which has been reported
recently by us and other research groups.7−11 In this respect, brownmillerites, with general formula
A2B2O5, are more advantageous because
more oxygen vacancies can be accommodated in their crystal lattice.
Brownmillerites are structurally similar to perovskites but with ordered
oxygen vacancies placed near coordinatively unsaturated B sites. This
ordering occurs in a variety of forms, such as layered or columnar.
The oxygen vacancies act as potential oxygen adsorption and transport
sites. As they exist within the coordination sphere of a transition-metal
ion in B site, this ion’s catalytic activity plays an important
role in further reduction and oxidation reactions of the adsorbed
oxygen species.

This is parameterized in terms of filling of
the cation as activity
descriptors in oxide catalysts for both OER and ORR reactions. Suntivich
et al. suggested that the activity can be improved by increasing the
covalency between metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals.12,13 Based on these activity descriptors and other considerations with
respect to oxygen vacancies, brownmillerite A2Fe2O5 with Fe site partially substituted with Co can be envisaged
to be good candidates as OER and ORR catalysts. Even though such attempts
are reported in the literature,14,15 a concerted effort
to vary the Co concentration and understand the effect systematically
in a bifunctional mode is lacking.

In this paper, we have addressed
this lacuna and report the role
of cobalt in Ca2Fe2O5 brownmillerite
oxide for simultaneous electrochemical oxygen reduction and evolution
reaction. With this material, we envisage a three-prong approach in
developing bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution catalysts; (i)
maximize oxygen vacancies through intrinsic structure, (ii) enhance
the catalytic activity of the B site in alignment with the activity
descriptors, and (iii) employ earth-abundant materials to bring in
cost effectiveness.

Results and Discussion
Three compounds
of formula Ca2Fe2–xCoxO5 (x = 0, 0.25,
1) denoted in the text as CFO, CFCO1, and CFCO2
were synthesized to study the effect of Co substitution on Fe-based
brownmillerite and consequent implications on their electrochemical
properties. Bulk elemental composition was identified by inductively
coupled plasma (ICP)–optical emission spectroscopy and found
to be comparable to calculated values (Supporting Information, ST2). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study (Figure
S1, Supporting Information) indicated that
the compounds crystallized in orthorhombic system reported similar
brownmillerite structures (PDF 71-2108, 45-0569, and 88-0814 for CFO,
CFCO1, and CFCO2, respectively). Traces of impurity phases of CaO
and Fe3O4 also could be identified. Attempts
to substitute higher concentrations (more than 50 atom %, x < 1) of Co in the B site were not successful. Detailed
structural studies of the three compounds, CFO, CFCO1, and CFCO2 were
carried out with the Rietveld refinement method using the GSAS-EXPGUI
suite of software, and the refined parameters and resultant profiles
are given in Table 1 and Figure 1a respectively.
Polyhedral representations of the unit cells are given in Figure S2
(Supporting Information). PXRD data of
CFO was refined by taking the Ca2Fe2O5 model crystallizing in an orthorhombic system and Pcmn space group (ICSD no. 14296). The impurity phases of CaO (ICSD no.
75785) and Fe3O4 (ICSD no. 31157) were also
inserted and quantitatively analyzed. Refinement proceeded smoothly
to get a good fit and the obtained cell parameter was a = 5.595 Å. The refinement results suggest that CFO has two
types of Fe atoms; Fe1 which forms Fe1O4 tetrahedral units
with O2 and O3, and Fe2 which forms Fe2O6 octahedral units
with O1 and O3, with O3 bridging Fe1O4 and Fe2O6 as represented in Figure 1b. The same model was used in case of CFCO1 by equally substituting
both Fe sites with Co in stoichiometric proportions. The unit cell
parameters and occupancy factors were also refined, and it was found
that the occupancy of Co nominally decreased from the stoichiometric
amount during refinement. This resulted in final cell composition
of Ca2Fe1.74Co0.24O5+δ, with cell parameters as a = 5.574 Å, b = 14.767 Å, and c = 5.399 Å,
which is in agreement with the previous reports.16,17 The best fit (on occupancy refining) was obtained by higher concentration
of Co in the tetrahedral site (∼12.7%) and decrease in octahedral
position occupancy (∼10.8%) than the nominal input composition
of 12.5%. The polyhedral representation of the layers is given in Figure 1c. Mixed octahedral
occupancy by both Fe and Co in a single site is represented by dark
blue and tetrahedral sites are represented by green.

to Fe1O4 tetrahedral units (olive) by O5 atoms. Red balls
represent O atoms in all cases.

The reported structure
of Ca2FeCoO5 (ICSD
no. 169345) crystallizing in the Pbcm space group
consists of two distinct crystallographic tetrahedral sites and two
octahedral sites based on single crystal XRD studies.16,18 In addition, such intralayer ordering is also observed in substituted
calcium ferrates, Ca2FeMnO5 ,and Ca2Fe1.5Cr0.5O5, where Mn3+ and Cr3+ show strong site preference for the octahedral
site.19 However, neutron diffraction, which
distinguishes Fe and Co positions, indicates interlayer ordering also
in Ca2FeCoO5, the only brownmillerite which
is found to do so. In such an interlayer ordering between tetrahedral
and octahedral layers, Fe in tetrahedral coordination is attached
to Co-rich octahedra from above and below and vice versa.18

Refinement of the data for CFCO2 in the
current study was tried
using the Pnma space group as in the matching PXRD
data of intralayer ordered Ca2FeMnO5 (PDF no.
88-0814), but it was unsuccessful; however, refinement proceeded smoothly
by following the abovementioned interlayer ordered model.18 On indexing, we observed that the cell parameters
are interchanged compared to the parent structure and the relation, a′–c, b′–2a, and c′–b was adopted for further refinement (Figure S2). In contrast to the other two compounds, CFO and CFCO1, this structure
consists of six different oxygen atoms because of interlayer ordering
and the refinement proceeded smoothly by mixing the occupancy of Fe
and Co in both sites. Three metal sites are defined—Co1(Fe1)
in tetrahedral coordination and Co2(Fe2) and Co3(Fe3) occupying octahedral
sites show variations in metal concentrations. Occupancy at 4a position
by Co3 and Fe3 is in the ratio of 70:30% which is denoted as site
B. 1d position is occupied more by Fe2 (∼80%) and to a lower
extent by Co2 denoted as site A. O6, O4, and O3 are coordinated to
Fe2/Co2 octahedra, with O6 bridging the cobalt-rich tetrahedra (Co1O4)
and iron-rich octahedra. O3 and O4 are commonly shared with the cobalt-rich
octahedra (Co3/Fe3O6) and iron-rich octahedra (Co2/Fe2O6). O5 bridges cobalt-rich octahedra (Co3/Fe3O6)
and iron-rich tetrahedra (Fe1O4). Occupancy factors were
also refined and found to be changed from the input stoichiometric
factor during the refinement process to obtain the chemical formula
of Ca2Fe1.05Co0.91O5+δ, which is corroborated by energy-dispersive system (EDS) analysis
(Section S3, Supporting Information).

On comparing the structural details of the three compounds, CFO,
CFCO1, and CFCO2, it is revealed that progressive substitution of
Co in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites leads to small polyhedral
distortions. For example, Oh–O–Td angle is more or less
the same for CFO and CFCO1 (139.98 and 140.61°, respectively)
but increases to 143.82° in CFCO2, whereas a more gradual decrease
in Oh–O–Oh (intralayer) angle occurs from 165.28 to
163.61° across the series.

Once the structural details
were understood, we proceeded with
further electrochemical studies by cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating
disc electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) techniques.
Linear sweep voltammograms of the catalysts under oxygen saturation
with 10 mV/s scan rate with 1600 rpm rotation are shown in Figure 2a. Cyclic voltammograms
at 50 mV/s scan rate and 900 rpm rotation are given in the inset.
In nitrogen saturation, they are nearly rectangular and the reduction
peak in the oxygen saturation in each pattern represents the ORR activity
of the compound. Both CFCO1 and CFO are found to be displaying the
same onset potential value of 0.811 V with respect to the reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) profiles.
Also, both of these compositions exhibit an onset potential, which
is ∼10 mV higher than that of CFCO2. Even though the onset
potentials are almost in the same range, we observe an enhancement
in the profile quality on cobalt incorporation. CFCO and CFCO1 display
profiles, which are gradiently increasing current density, whereas
CFCO2 displays a limiting current plateau from ∼0.6 to ∼0.3
V versus RHE. This can be because of the improved mechanism with Co
doping. In the plateau region, the reaction may be occurring through
a desired four-electron mechanism, thereafter, shifting to two-electron
mechanism or mixed mechanism as exhibited by CFO and CFCO1, which
is later confirmed by Koutechy–Levich (K–L) plots analysis
and RRDE experiments.

Figure 2 (a) Linear sweep voltammogram at 1600 rpm at 10 mV/s scan
rate
in O2 saturation (inset shows cyclic voltammogram at 900
rpm with 50 mV/s scan rate, solid lines represent profiles in O2 saturation, and dotted lines represent profiles in N2 saturation), (b) K–L plot at a potential of 0.09 V
vs RHE, and (c) Tafel plots for ORR of the catalysts, where empty
symbols represent raw data and solid lines represent linear fit of
raw data.

Further, geometric limiting current
density was also found to increase
with increase in Co concentration, which is a direct implication of
the availability of active sites in the catalyst.

Another parameter
which is of importance in understanding catalytic
activity is halfwave potential. Determination of the halfwave potential
is not trivial in case of oxides because the profile does not reach
the limiting current as in the case of metals. Hence, the method adopted
for comparing the halfwave potential is to select a common potential
and to analyze the current density, and the potential at which half
that current density is acquired is noted as the halfwave potential.
Determination of the half-wave potential of these compounds at a common
potential of 0.4 V revealed that CFCO2 exhibited better halfwave potential
of 0.7 V versus RHE, which was 10 and 50 mV higher than that of CFCO1
and CFO, respectively. This is a clear indication of enhancement of
ORR kinetics on cobalt doping in calcium ferrate.

The K–L
plots (equation and details in Supporting Information) of the compounds are represented in Figure 2b. CFO exhibited
two distinctly different slopes indicating a multiple electron-transfer
mechanism with an overall slope value of 0.555 mA cm–2 S1/2. CFCO1 also behaved similarly with overall slope
of 0.5572 mA cm–2 S1/2. However, a straight
line was obtained in the K–L plot of CFCO2 with the slope value
of 0.5264 mA cm–2 S1/2. Hence, it is
clear that the reaction adopts a four-electron pathway as the Co concentration
increases. The compounds CFO and CFCO1 also displayed Tafel slopes
of −142.1 and −124.5 mV/decade (Figure 2c; equation and details in Supporting Information), indicating nearly similar mechanisms
in these compounds with first electron reduction as the rate-determining
step (rds). However, for CFCO2, the value was −59.2 mV/decade,
pointing to a pseudo two-electron reduction and migration of the superoxide
ion for further reduction as the rds.20

Figure 3 shows
the
dependence of potential on the electron transfer number. The compound
CFO has reasonable stability in the electron transfer number in the
given potential window for the reaction. The CFO and the two compositions,
viz. CFCO1 and CFCO2, approach the electron count of 4 at lower potentials
comparable with that of a standard 40 wt % Pt/C (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Close analysis of the
e–n plot suggests that at higher cathodic potential, the electron
transfer mechanism is similar in all compounds. There is a distinct
change in the mechanism in CFCO2 after ∼0.3 V. Peroxide yield,
which is also an important parameter in judging the stability and
mechanistic aspects of ORR, is usually higher when the reaction proceeds
through 2-electron mechanism. The catalyst which undergoes 2-e pathway
is useful in the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, but in fuel cell applications, H2O2 production
is harmful and the 4-e mechanism is preferred to get maximum power
output with only pure water as the exhaust.21−23 The peroxide
yield is more in CFO compared to the Co-doped varieties. This implies
that as the cobalt concentration increases the mechanism shifts from
the 2-e to 4-e route as evidenced from the e–n plot. It is
noteworthy here that the trend in electron count and peroxide yield
is favorably different in the Co-doped catalysts than the parent Fe-based
brownmillerite at higher potentials. CFCO2 shows a steady electron
count of 3.5 till 0.4 V, after which it starts an upward turn to reach
3.9 at 0.7 V. A similar trend is seen in the peroxide yield also with
a decrease from 25% at 0.4 V to 10% at 0.7 V. CFCO1 also shows a similar
inflection point at 0.5 V. Very interestingly, the behavior of this
compound mirrors that of the parent compound CFO at lower potentials,
as evident from the decrease in electron count and increase in peroxide
yield till 0.5 V.

plot)
calculated from RRDE results (filled symbols), and peroxide yield
calculated from RRDE results are represented by the empty symbols.

Here, we hypothesize that such
an inflection point observed in
CFCO1 and CFCO2 may be due to the occurrence of some redox processes
at potentials above 0.4 V. To get more insights into this, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on fresh catalysts as
well after applying potential in the range of 0.4–0.7 V where
such behavior was observed. Fresh catalysts showed the presence of
Fe(III), Co(III), and Co(II). The spectra for Fe is deconvoluted into
five peaks as in the literature.24,25 The Co 2p
XPS spectra for CFCO1 and CFCO2 were fitted with two doublet peaks
and two broad satellite peaks (Figure 4a). The peak at ∼780 eV and the broad satellite
peak at higher binding energy (788–789 eV) can be ascribed
to the Co(III) species, the presence of the satellite peak at ∼6
eV, which is higher than the 2p3/2 peak, indicates the
presence of Co in +2 state, confirming the presence of both +2 and
+3 states. The presence of Co(III) species is further confirmed by
the 2p3/2 2p1/2 spin-orbit coupling value near
15 eV.25−31 From the deconvoluted peak area, the relative composition of both
states is calculated. CFCO1 consists of 62.86% Co in +3 oxidation
state, whereas CFCO2 contains 74.75% Co in +3 oxidation state.

Figure 4 (a) Co 2p XPS
of CFCO1 (red) and CFCO2 (black) (b) Co 2p XPS of
used catalyst CFCO1 (red) and CFCO2 (black).

On applying the potential (0.4–0.7 V), Fe 2p XPS showed
no difference in the oxidation state; the deconvoluted peaks were
at nearly the same binding energy as that of the parent compound indicating
that oxidation state of Fe was not affected.

However, in case
of Co, a distinct difference in ionic state distribution
vis-à-vis Co(II) and Co(III) could be observed (Figure 4b). In both compounds, relative
percentage of Co(II) species increased after potential treatment.
Percentage of Co(II) increased from 25 to 39 and 37 to 41% in CFCO2
and CFCO1, respectively. Hence, we can infer that Co in +2 oxidation
state is more conducive for ORR, and CFCO2 not only has higher concentrations
of Co but has more Co(II) content also.

Accelerated durability
test was conducted for 5000 cycles in Co-doped
compounds, and they were found to be stable. XRD analysis of the samples
after 3000 segments in CV did not show any change of phase indicating
structural stability (Supporting Information Section S6.5).

OER was conducted in 0.1 M alkaline solution
in a potential range
of 0.87–1.97 V with respect to RHE. Figure 5a shows the comparison of the OER activity
of the catalysts and that of Vulcan carbon. The scan rate in all cycles
was 10 mV/s with nitrogen saturation. Here also we observed a substantial
increase in activity on progressive Co doping (Figure 5a). The onset potential for the most active
composition CFCO2 was 1.53 V, whereas the onset potential for CFCO1
was slightly higher at ∼1.64 V (vs RHE). CFO shows the highest
overpotential at ∼1.73 V, which is comparable to Vulcan carbon
at ∼1.82 V. The electrochemical performance parameters of these
catalysts are comparable with those of state-of-the-art noble metal-based
catalysts. Onset potential of the Co-doped compounds range from 1.53
to 1.64 V, whereas that of IrO2 is 1.5 V.32 In addition, the potential required to reach current density
of 10 mA cm–2 is only ∼0.2 V higher than
that of IrO2.32 Current densities
of the compounds were monitored at 1.8 V and plotted in Figure 5b. As expected, when Co concentration
increases, oxygen evolution activity also increases.

plots for OER reaction of the catalysts, where empty symbols represent
raw data and the solid line represents the linear fit of the raw data.

The kinetics of OER was studied
by calculating the Tafel slope
values (Figure 5c).
The compound CFO exhibited higher value of Tafel slope at 139 mV/decades,
whereas it reduced advantageously for both Co-doped compounds (CFCO1:
50.32 mV/decades and CFCO2: 58.05 mV/decades). These values are comparable
to the highly active quadrupole perovskites reported recently, and
the intrinsic activity was much higher than that reported for the
perovskites CaMnO3 and LaMnO3 (Tafel slope:
∼155 mV/decades).33 To explain this,
OER can also be considered to follow a mechanism similar to that of
ORR, as suggested by De Faria et al.99 a   b   c   d  where S is the surface active site; the intermediate
species distinguished with asterisk sign are in different energy levels.
Similar to ORR, when the rds is the first step a, involving one electron transfer, the Tafel slope value is 120 mV/decades.

If the rds is the second step b, involving
the migration of the surface intermediate species, the Tafel slope
value will be 60 mV/decade.34 In the present
study, the undoped CFO exhibits the Tafel slope value of 139 mV/decade,
indicating the first electron transfer step to be the rds. On doping
with Co, the Tafel slope value is reduced considerably, indicating
an enhancement in intrinsic activity with the rds understood to be
surface migration.

Further, effect of doping on the bulk conductivity
of the material
was studied by plotting the I–V curve over a potential window of −0.1 to +0.1 V. Samples
were made into pellets of 13 mm diameter and current–potential
relation was analyzed to obtain conductivity data (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Conductivity of CFCO1
and CFCO2 increased about six- and tenfold, respectively, when compared
to that of CFO, indicating that Co doping of Ca2Fe2O5 definitely improved its bulk conductivity.

Various catalysts ranging from noble metal mixture to cost effective
modified carbon-based structures are studied for their bifunctional
oxygen electrocatalytic studies.34−36 The brownmillerite oxide
is advantageous in terms of abundance of raw materials and catalytic
activity. The CFCO2 carries out the ORR in a near 4-electron pathway
and the lowest Tafel slope value of −59 mV/decade compared
to the best catalysts. OER Tafel slope values of cobalt-doped analogues
are still lesser than the recently reported bifunctional catalysts
such as sulfidized LDH36 and N-doped graphene/single-walled
carbon nanotube hybrids.34 From these studies,
it is clear that all electrochemical performance parameters for the
Co-doped compounds are superior to that of the parent Fe compound
and such doping strategies can be used further for developing potential
alternatives to noble metal-based electrocatalysts.

Conclusions
Brownmillerite Ca2Fe2O5 and two
of its Co-doped analogues (Ca2FeCoO5 and Ca2Fe1.75Co0.25O5) were synthesized
by solid state reaction and detailed structural studies conducted
by Rietveld refinement of the PXRD patterns. No specific crystallographic
site preference could be identified for Co doping, and partial occupancy
of both octahedral and tetrahedral coordinations with small polyhedral
distortions was observed. The catalysts are tested for simultaneous
activity in two important electrochemical reactions viz., ORR and
OER. The dopant Co was expected to have a role in the enhancement
of activity as per the earlier reports on the activity descriptors.
The intrinsic conductivity of the material is found to be enhanced
with increase of dopant concentration. The ORR activity in terms of
onset potential and halfwave potentials also improved with the increase
in Co concentration in the brownmillerite oxide. The kinetic studies
conducted by Tafel slope analysis indicates that the rds changes on
cobalt doping. For the compounds, Ca2Fe2O5 and Ca2Fe1.75Co0.25O5 (Tafel slope value ≈ 120 mV/decade), the first electron
transfer step is the rds, and in case of Ca2FeCoO5 (Tafel slope value ≈ 60 mV/decade), the surface migration
after the first electron reduction is found to be the rds. Peroxide
yield and electron count determined from the RRDE analysis also indicate
that Co doping enhances the catalytic property. The oxygen reduction
by Ca2FeCoO5 takes place through a stable four-electron
mechanism and is characterized by lower peroxide yield as compared
to the other species (∼10–25%). Co doping in low concentration
itself has a marked effect in the OER activity. The current and onset
potential increased several times compared to Ca2Fe2O5. This effect also manifests in the lowering
of the Tafel slope value from the undoped to doped brownmillerite
(139 mV/decade for Ca2Fe2O5, 50.32
mV/decade for Ca2Fe1.75Co0.25O5, and 58.05 mV/decade for Ca2FeCoO5),
indicating the change in the rds on Co doping. With this material,
we envisage a three-prong approach in developing bifunctional oxygen
reduction/evolution catalysts; (i) maximize oxygen vacancies through
intrinsic structure, (ii) enhance the catalytic activity of the B
site in alignment with the activity descriptors, and (iii) employ
earth-abundant materials to bring in cost effectiveness.

Experimental
Section
The compounds were synthesized by the solid state
method using
CaCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%), Fe2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.98%), and CoCO3·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich, Co = 43–47%) as the
starting materials. The precursors in stoichiometric proportions were
weighed and ball milled at 150 rpm for 2 h and calcined at 1100 °C
for 12 h with intermittent grinding. Bulk composition was confirmed
by plasma atomic emission spectrometer (MP-AES, Agilent, wavelength
range 190–770 nm) with a charge-coupled device detector. Surface
area measurement was carried out in QUADRASORB SI automated surface
area and pore size analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments). Morphology
and surface composition were analyzed by scanning electron microscope
(Leica Stereoscan 440) with an EDS attachment (Bruker, D451-10c energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometer). Phase formation was confirmed with
PXRD in PANalytical Xpert Pro dual goniometer diffractometer with
Ni as the filter and Cu Kα source operating at 40 kV and 30
mA. Room temperature diffraction patterns were recorded with X’Celerator
solid state detector with step size 0.008° and time per step
96.52 s. The obtained patterns were refined using the GSAS-EXPGUI
suit of programs37 to calculate unit cell
parameters and structure parameters. Electrochemical properties were
analyzed by Biologic SP-300 electrochemical workstation, equipped
with pine electrode speed control. Catalyst ink applied on the surface
of the glassy carbon electrode connected to a rotating shaft acted
as the working electrode. Graphite rod was taken as the auxiliary
electrode, and Hg/HgO was the reference electrode. The techniques
used were CV and LSV. First, Vulcan XC 72 carbon was activated with
H2O2 treatment at 80 °C for 10 h. The conductivity
obtained by making a pellet of the same with four-probe technique
was 1.23 S/cm. Activated carbon (40 mg) was ballmilled with 60 mg
of the brownmillerite compounds at 400 rpm for 2 h. The catalyst ink
was prepared by weighing 5 mg of this mixture and dispersing in 40
μL of 5 wt % Nafion solution and 960 μL of 3:1 IPA–water
mixture. Catalyst ink (10 μL) was applied to the glassy carbon
surface for electrochemical analysis. ORR study was conducted both
with N2 and O2 saturation. CV experiments were
conducted with 50 mV/s scan rate from 0.2 to −0.9 V with respect
to Hg/HgO. LSV profiles were recorded in 10 mV/s scan rate in 400,
900, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2500 rpm rotations using RDE. The RRDE
technique was used to determine the electron transfer number associated
with the reaction. Pt/C ink (40 wt %) prepared in the same manner
was used as a standard for the reaction; the sample was scanned in
the same potential window at 10 mV/s at 1600 rpm in O2 saturation.
OER studies were conducted with the same catalyst ink separately in
N2 saturation at 1600 rpm rotation with 10 mV/s scan rate,
where the potential window applied was maintained from 0 to 1 V with
respect to Hg/HgO. All the above electrochemical analysis was performed
in alkaline medium of 0.1 M KOH (Sigma-Aldrich) in demineralized water.
XPS studies were done by K-Alpha+ model (Thermo Fischer Scientific,
UK) with Al Kα source. XPS data of all three compounds were
fitted with Shirley-type background subtraction method using XPS PEAK41
software. The C 1s was standardized to 284.8 eV, and the curves obtained
for the Co and Fe were fitted by applying charge correction factor.
