Herein,
we report the synthesis of guest–host systems comprising
naphthyl–viologen–naphthyl (Np–Vio–Np)
and viologen–naphthyl–viologen (Vio–Np–Vio)
guest molecules and their subsequent supramolecular polymerization
in the presence of a CB[8] host in water. In addition, the guest complexation
of ethyl-terminated trimeric viologen (ETV) with Np–Vio–Np
and CB[8] was investigated. As a result of supramolecular interactions,
2D supramolecular organic frameworks with high internal periodicity
were constructed. 1H NMR studies clearly demonstrated the
formation of a host-stabilized charge-transfer complex via folding
back (Np–Vio–Np and Vio–Np–Vio) in the
presence of CB[8]. In the case of ETV + Np–Vio–Np +
CB[8], a large polymeric network was formed as indicated by the NMR
titrations. UV–vis and fluorescence studies clearly confirm
the formation of an inter/intra molecular CT complex upon complexation
with cucurbit[8]uril. The size obtained using the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) method pinpoints the formation of larger supramolecular aggregates
in the order of μm through host–guest assembly, which
is further complemented by FESEM and TEM. SAXS measurements indicate
the formation of a 2D supramolecular polymer/polymer aggregate with
long-range order.

1 Introduction
Construction
of supramolecular polymers highly relies on the nature
of the host/guest molecule used.1−3 Molecular interactions such as
hydrogen bonding interactions, metal-coordination bonds, electrostatic
interactions, donor–acceptor interactions, π–π
interactions, ion–dipole interactions, and so forth are frequently
employed for the construction of supramolecular polymers.3−7 In certain cases, even multiple driving forces are utilized that
are identical to the biological systems.6 Supramolecular assemblies involving interlocked systems8 received wide attention owing to their key role
in the construction of stimuli responsive smart materials including
molecular switches, molecular displays, molecular wires, and intelligent
artificial materials.9−11 Reversible and very directional secondary interactions12,13 such as hydrogen bonding, ion–dipole interactions, and charge–transfer
interactions are used as versatile building tools to construct supramolecular
polymers with specific functions as they offer controllability, reversibility,
and stimuli responsive behavior.4,5,14,15 In particular, assembly of supramolecular
polymers in aqueous solutions attracts wide attention as they mimic
biological systems or find applications in the areas of optics, biology,
or electronics.14,16,17 Several host and guest molecules such as cucurbit[n]urils, calixarenes,
crown ethers, cyclodextrins, and so forth and viologens, pyridinium,
substituted ammonium salts, and so forth were used to construct supramolecular
polymers based on ion–dipole, hydrophobic, or electrostatic
interactions.6

N,N′-Dialkyl-4,4′-bipyridinium,
commonly known as viologen (V2+), exists in different ionic
states (V2+ ↔ V•+ ↔ V0), dicationic, monocation radical, and neutral states with
respect to the applied electrochemical potential.18−20 The ease of
dimerization (V•+↔ •+V)
of viologen cation radicals (V•+)21−23 and charge-transfer
(CT) complex formation between the monocation radicals, the electron
deficient viologen (dication) and electron rich aromatic entities
[naphthalene, coumarin, tetrathiafulvalene, etc.]19,24−26 offer synthetic chemists to design new architectures
to assemble different entities via supramolecular interactions resulting
in the formation of stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers.27

Cucurbit[8]uril commonly denoted as CB[8]
is a macrocyclic cavity
made up of glycoluril units that are interconnected by methylene bridges.28 It binds both neutral as well as cationic guest
molecules via hydrophobic and cation–dipole interactions.29 Its specific binding properties and the cavity
space allows for the incorporation of two appropriate aromatic guests,
such as, viologen radical dimers22 or naphthyl
and viologen units30 instantaneously. This
binding behavior of CB[8] is widely investigated and utilized in the
construction of supramolecular polymers, where CB[8] is employed as
a host as well as a bridging unit.31 Liu
and co-workers reported the instantaneous molecular recognition between
adamantine and β-CD with viologen and CB[8] guest–host
pairs, which results in the formation of a quaternary complex guided
by hydrophobic and CT interactions.5 As
a result of these interactions, pseudorotaxane (supramolecular polymer)
was formed. Very recently Chang et al. reported the linear supramolecular
assembly through host–guest interactions using methyl viologen,
coumarin guests, and CB[8] host.14 By
introducing an azobenzene monomer, the morphology of the formed polymer
changes from linear to dendritic. Zhang et al. reported the construction
of two dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic framework utilizing
viologen cation radical and CB[8].32 Recently,
we reported on the formation of reversible 2 dimensional supramolecular
organic framework comprising viologen monocation radicals and CB[8],
where dimeric, trimeric, and star-shaped viologen monocation radicals
were used in the construction of supramolecular polymers within the
CB[8] cavity.22 In this work, we report
the synthesis of naphthyl-terminated viologen (Np–Vio–Np)
and viologen-terminated naphthyl (Vio–Np–Vio) systems
and their subsequent supramolecular polymer formation with ethyl-terminated
trimeric viologen (ETV) in the CB[8] cavity (Figure 1).

2 Result and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The starting materials 1, 2, and 3 were synthesized using
the reported procedures.33−35 All target compounds, Np–Vio–Np
and Vio–Np–Vio, were obtained from nucleophilic substitution
reactions between the corresponding alkyl halide with free or mono
alkylated 4,4′-bipyridine in CH3CN. The starting
material 1 (10 fold excess) was reacted with 4,4′-bipyridine
in CH3CN to afford Np–Vio–Np (80%). An identical
reaction condition was followed for the synthesis of Vio–Np–Vio,
where compound 2 was reacted with 3 (10
fold excess) to obtain Vio–Np–Vio (75%). Finally, the
ETV molecule was synthesized using a procedure reported in our previous
work.22 The as-synthesized molecules were
then characterized by 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR,
ESI-MS, and elemental analyses (Scheme 1).

2.2 NMR Investigations
1H
NMR study was carried out to ascertain the binding process of viologen
with naphthyl units that are interconnected with flexible butyl linkers
(Np–Vio–Np and Vio–Np–Vio) with CB[8].

2.2.1 NMR Titration of Np–Vio–Np
with CB[8]
Initially, we started our investigation on the
formation of the CT complex (1:1) in Np–Vio–Np molecules
within CB[8] cavity. CB[8] was added in small portions, and the corresponding 1H NMR spectra was recorded. Addition of 0.5 and 1.0 equiv
CB[8] to the Np–Vio–Np sample resulted in the upfield
shift of Np protons, that is, some of the Np protons appeared in the
region of 6.67–6.43 and 6.03 ppm (upfield shift), which is
indicative of the inclusion in the hydrophobic CB[8] cavity (Figure 2a).36,37 Encapsulation into the CB[8] cavity results in the conformational
restriction of Np protons and as a result Np protons experience magnetically
different environments resulting in peak splitting/peak shifts.36 In the free Np–Vio–Np molecule,
the bipyridinium protons “a” and “b” appeared
as a doublet at 8.8 and 7.6 ppm, respectively; however, in the presence
of 0.5 and 1 equiv CB[8], the peak at 8.8 ppm has split into two peaks
(i.e., a broad doublet and a broad quartet shifted to the upfield
region indicating the interaction with Np moiety and encapsulation
into the CB[8] cavity). Similarly, the peak at 7.6 ppm has split into
three peaks (all appeared as broad doublets, of which two doublets
appeared in the downfield region). All these results clearly indicate
a face-to-face π–π stacking with the naphthyl unit
and an aromatic π-electron shielding of the bipyridinium units
upon inclusion in the CB[8] cavity.38

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of (a) Np–Vio–Np (7.0 mM)
molecule upon addition of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 equiv CB[8] and CB[8]
alone from bottom to top; (b) NOESY spectrum of Np–Vio–Np
+ 1.5 equiv CB[8] in D2O at 25 °C.

Besides naphthalene and bipyridinium protons, the
methylene protons
too showed peakshifts, that is, the methylene protons c and f on linker
were shifted to downfield (c = 4.73–4.94 ppm, f = 4.01–4.49 ppm), indicating that both these −CH2 groups were not encapsulated into the CB[8] cavity. All these
observations certainly indicate that one of the terminal Np units
in the Np–Vio–Np molecule backfolds to bipyridinium
center upon addition of 1.0 equiv CB[8] via host-stabilized intramolecular
CT complexation. Further 0.5 equiv addition (1.5 equiv in total) of
CB[8] results in the complexation of another Np unit in Np–Vio–Np,
that is, encapsulation results in the broadening of few Np signals,
some of the peaks between 7.7 and 6.7 ppm were upfield shifted (the
intensity of peaks between 6.7 and 6.4 ppm increased), indicating
encapsulation into the second CB[8] cavity (due to the increased intensity
of CB[8] signals, the aromatic signals of bipyridinium and naphthalene
appeared very low in intensity).

In nuclear Overhauser enhancement
spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum
the cross peaks were observed between protons (a, j, and m), (b, k,
and l) and (b, j, and m), when 1.5 equiv CB[8] is added, ascribed
to the close packing of bipyridinium and Np moieties (one over the
other) inside CB[8] cavity as shown in (Figure 2b). Finally, when 2.0 equiv of CB[8] is added,
drastic changes in the NMR spectrum with low resolved signal was observed,
which clearly demonstrates the formation of aggregates/polymer via
CT complexation (repetitive orientation of Np and Vio units inside
CB[8] cavity in water).

2.2.2 NMR Titration of Vio–Np–Vio
with CB[8]
Similar self-assembly was observed in the case
of Vio–Np–Vio molecule; here, viologen backfolded onto
the naphthalene unit upon addition of first CB[8] unit, that is, both
viologen and subsequent addition of CB[8] led to the complexation
of free viologen. Addition of 0.5 equiv CB[8] resulted in the upfield
shift of Np protons (7.4–6.7 ppm were shifted to 6.66–6.51,
6.01, 5.94 ppm), indicating the encapsulation of Np unit into the
CB[8] cavity (Figure 3a). In contrast, bipyridinium protons showed a mixed response, that
is, uncomplexed bipyridinium proton does not show any peak shift,
whereas the complexed bipyridinium protons responded to their new
chemical environment. Both the bipyridinium protons “c”
and “d” (8.9 and 8.1 ppm) experienced downfield shifts
(few set of peaks in the range of 9.37–8.07 ppm) upon addition
of 0.5 equiv CB[8], indicating the face-to-face π–π
stacking with the naphthyl unit and aromatic π-electron shielding
of the bipyridinium units upon inclusion in the CB[8] cavity.38 In the presence of 1.0 equiv, some of bipyridinium
peaks disappeared and broad peaks with low resolution were observed
signifying that one of the bipyridinium unit is completely incorporated
into the CB[8] cavity due to the host-stabilized charge–transfer
interactions.39 When the CB[8] concentration
is 1.5 equiv, the uncomplexed viologen unit also gets encapsulated
indicated by slight upfield shift and peak broadening. Moreover, during
the encapsulation, the protons o, p, q, and r on tether experience
the shielded environments and suffer by steric hindrance as well.
Consequently these protons appeared in the region of 3.19–1.59
ppm were shifted slightly upfield. Furthermore, 0.5 equiv addition
of CB[8] (2.0 equiv in total) scarcely affected the peak intensity;
however, minor upfield shifts on the bipyridinium and aliphatic protons
were noted and almost all of the peaks appeared broadened, indicating
the formation of larger aggregates/polymer via CT complexation. The
NOESY spectrum for the [(Vio–Np–Vio) + 1.5 equiv CB[8]]
complexed mixture gave additional information for the formation of
ternary inclusion complex. The cross peaks between bipyridinium protons
c and d and m, n, l, and i protons of Np units confirms the occurrence
of both the units inside the CB[8] cavity as observed in the case
of Np–Vio–Np (Figure 3b).

(5.20
mM) molecule upon addition of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 equiv CB[8] and
CB[8] alone, from bottom to top; (b) NOESY spectrum of Vio–Np–Vio
+ 1.5 equiv CB[8] in D2O at 25 °C.

2.2.3 NMR Titration of ETV
with CB[8] and Subsequent
Addition of Np–Vio–Np
The self-assembly of
ETV with CB[8] is well-known from our previous work where viologen
monocation radicals were encapsulated into the CB[8] cavity to form
supramolecular polymer.22 In this work,
we were interested to complex dicationic ETV into the CB[8] cavity.
The host–guest process was initiated by adding 1.5 and 3.0
equiv of CB[8] to the ETV solution in D2O, during which
the bipyridinium protons displayed upfield and downfield shifts (two
sets of broad peaks in the region of 9.18–8.91 and 8.72–8.52
ppm) indicative of encapsulation into the hydrophobic cavity. When
3 equiv CB[8] is added to ETV, 1:1 stoichiometric complexation between
CB[8] and ETV is expected. To this complexed solution, 1.0 equiv Np–Vio–Np
molecule was added, so that the Np will undergo face-to-face π–π
stacked intermolecular CT complex formation with complexed ETV inside
the CB[8]. It is noteworthy that both the bipyridinium and naphthalene
units experienced downfield and upfield shifts upon complexation as
in the case of Np–Vio–Np, indicating the formation of
intermolecular CT complex in the CB[8] cavity (Figure 4a). This observation is further confirmed
by the cross peaks between bipyridinium and naphthalene protons in
NOESY spectrum (Figure 4b). When adding 2.0 equiv Np–Vio–Np, the resultant
spectrum did not show any significant changes because of poor solubility
of the second guest in D2O. All these observations above
certainly signify the formation of larger aggregates.

spectrum of ETV (4.30 mM) alone, ETV + 3.0
equiv CB[8], Np–Vio–Np alone, ETV + 3.0 equiv CB[8]
+ 1.0 equiv NP–Vio–NP, and ETV + 3.0 equiv CB[8] + 2.0
equiv NP–Vio–NP and CB[8] alone, from bottom to top;
(b) NOESY spectrum of ETV + 3.0 equiv CB[8] + 1.0 equiv Np–Vio–Np
in D2O at 25 °C.

In general, supramolecular systems undergo conformational
changes
(for example, folded form to an extended form) in response to an external
chemical stimulus.39 Further, physical
stimuli, such as, heat, ultrasound, are used to acquire better solubility
of host and guest molecules and could also be used to assist the conformational
changes. In this study, the guest molecules such as Np–Vio–Np,
Vio–Np–Vio, and ETV are involved in larger aggregate/polymeric
species formation in extended arrangements with CB[8] host.

2.3 UV–Vis and Fluorescence Study
UV–vis
spectroscopy is a prominent tool which is frequently
employed to probe the CT complexation process between electron-rich
and electron-deficient species. During the NMR titration, color change
upon CB[8] addition was noticed, that is, the color of Np–Vio–Np
changed from brown to pale orange (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The color changes could be attributed
to the host-stabilized CT complexation.36 To gain more insight on the interaction and to investigate the formation
of intramolecular CT complex, UV–vis titration was carried
out by varying the concentration of CB[8], while the guest concentration
was kept constant. Initial study was carried out between Np–Vio–Np
and CB[8]. Upon addition of 1.0 equiv CB[8] to Np–Vio–Np
(0.28 mmol) solution, visual color change from yellow to brown is
noticed, signified by a new broad absorption band centered around
405 nm, corresponding to the formation of an intramolecular CT complex
as indicated by 1H NMR titrations (Figure 5a). These results clearly indicate the backfolding
of Np over the Vio moiety upon inclusion in the CB[8] cavity as this
is the only possibility. Addition of further 1 equiv. CB[8] resulted
in the increase in the intensity of CT band around 405 nm which is
attributed to the extension of CT complex by self-exchange of CB[8]
between free and CT-complexed entities within the same molecule leading
to the formation of larger aggregates.

and (c) ETV (0.28 mM) guest molecules. (d) fluorescence emission spectrum
of Np–Vio–Np in different concentrations of CB[8] in
H2O, rt.

In the case of Vio–Np–Vio,
characteristic CT band
was observed in the visible region centered around 415 and 560 nm
in the presence of 1 and 2 equiv CB[8] (Figure 5b). In addition, the color of the solution
turned from brown to purple, which is indicative of the formation
of a CT complex between naphthalene and bipyridinium units inside
the CB[8] cavity. Thus, the broad absorption bands between 400 and
600 nm clearly indicated the existence of intramolecular host-induced
CT interaction in the complexed species.39 Furthermore, the CT interaction between the donor (Np) and the acceptor
(Vio) units is strengthened by the space restrictions existing in
the CB[8] cavity.36 Thus, the host-enhanced
CT interaction allows for the formation of 1:1:1 ternary complex between
Vio, Np, and CB[8] units, which further extends as a supramolecular
polymer or supramolecular aggregates.39,40

Similarly
in the case of ETV molecules, the CT complex formation
in the presence of CB[8] was monitored by incremental addition of
CB[8] and second guest (Np–Vio–Np) in a different stoichiometric
ratio (Figure 5c).
UV–vis spectrum of ETV and ETV – 3CB[8] complexed species
(blue and red line) shown in Figure 4c did not show any absorption peak in the range of
300–700 nm, indicating the absence of characteristic CT band
in both ETV molecule and ETV – 3CB[8] complexed species. Upon
addition of 1.0 equiv of Np–Vio–Np guest to the ETV
– 3CB[8] complex, a broad absorption peak at 403 nm was observed.
This is attributed to the encapsulation of the terminal Np group into
the CB[8] cavity, which is already occupied with bipyridinium group
of ETV molecule leading to the formation of intermolecular CT complex
(color change from colorless to orange). Subsequent additions (2 and
3 equiv) of the second guest (Np–Vio–Np) molecule facilitated
the CT complexation process as indicated by the enhancement of CT
band and in addition blue shift was observed (from 403 to 398 nm).
The intermolecular CT complexation in this case favors the formation
of supramolecular polymers as indicated by the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Particle size measurements of Np–Vio–Np (0.70 mM),
Vio–Np–Vio (0.70 mM), and ETV (0.70 mM) molecules in
the presence of CB[8] in different stoichiometric ratio in H2O, rt.

The fluorescence emission study
was carried out for Np–Vio–Np
in the presence of CB[8] to infer additional information on host-stabilized
CT complexation. The fluorescence spectrum of Np–Vio–Np
showed strong emission peak at 470 nm corresponding to naphthalene
chromophore. Upon addition of 1.0 equiv CB[8], slight decrease in
fluorescent intensity (30%) was observed with emission peak centered
at 490 nm (red shift, Δλ = 20 nm) ascribed to improved
CT complex formation inside the CB[8] cavity between Np and bipyridinium
units as discussed in NMR and UV–vis study (Figure 5d).39,41 Further addition of CB[8] (2.0 equiv) led to the increase in the
intensity of CT band, which is due to the extension of CT interaction
between donor and acceptor species in the same Np–Vio–Np
molecule as discussed in the UV–vis study.

2.4 Particle Size Measurements
DLS measurements
is a key tool to state the existence of supramolecular polymeric species/larger
aggregates in solution. The DLS measurements were carried out to get
clear insights on the supramolecular polymer assemblies formed by
different guest molecules (Np–Vio–Np, Vio–Np–Vio,
and ETV) with CB[8] host in aqueous solution. The DH values for the as-formed self-assembled species were
found to be 0.63 μm for Np–Vio–Np, 0.53 μm
for Vio–Np–Vio, and 0.77 μm for ETV, respectively.
These DH values clearly indicate the formation
of larger aggregates (polymeric species) by the guest molecules in
the presence of CB[8] host via self-assembly process (Figure 6). The formation of these larger
aggregates could be attributed to the formation of 2D assemblies as
reported in our previous study.14 The degree
of polymerization is in the order, ETV – 3 (CB[8]–Np–Vio–Np)
> Np–Vio–Np–2CB[8] > Vio–Np–Vio-2CB[8].
Herein, the degree of polymerization is more favored for the ETV –
3 (CB[8]–Np–Vio–Np) combination guided by intermolecular
CT complexation, and this result is very much related to the results
obtained in UV–vis studies.

Zeta potential measurements
were carried out to understand the stability of colloidal dispersion
obtained from viologen guests (Np–Vio–Np, Vio–Np–Vio,
and ETV) and CB[8] (Figure S3). The zeta
potential values are +33.5, +34.6, and +38.0 mV for Np–Vio–Np–2CB[8],
Vio–Np–Vio-2CB[8], and ETV + 3 (Np–Vio–Np
+ CB[8]), respectively. These values clearly indicate the formation
of aggregates with good stability.

2.5 Diffusion-Ordered
Spectroscopy
Diffusion-ordered
spectroscopy (DOSY) experiment was carried out to examine the formation
of aggregates/polymers as the diffusion coefficient (D) clearly distinguishes between the complexed and uncomplexed host–guest
molecules, provided that there is a sufficient difference in their D values.42 The D values of guest molecules are considerably small compared to the
complexed species resulting from the addition of 1.0 and 2.0 equiv
CB[8] (CB[8] is added to the guest molecule in solution, Table 1).31 The D value of free Np–Vio–Np monomer was
2.88 × 10–10 m2/s, and the D value gradually decreased with the CB[8] addition, indicating
the increase in molecular weight of the complex.10,31 When 2 equiv CB[8] is added, the host-stabilized CT complex of Np–Vio–Np
showed a D value of 1.02 × 10–10 m2/s, which is nearly one-third of the D value of the corresponding monomer. In the case of Vio–Np–Vio
molecule, the D value decreases from 3.16 ×
10–10 to 9.33 × 10–11 m2/s upon addition of 2.0 equiv CB[8] to the guest solution.
Thus, the significant decrease in D value confirms
the formation of larger supramolecular aggregates/polymer in the presence
of CB[8]. In the case of ETV and ETV – 3(CB[8]), the D values obtained were in the range of 5.88 and 5.49 ×
10–10 m2/s, respectively. Incremental
addition of Np–Vio–Np guest to the complexed species
resulted in the gradual decrease of D values indicating
the formation of larger species.

2.6 FESEM
Field emission
scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) measurements were carried out to investigate the
surface morphologies of the as-formed supramolecular polymers using
Np–Vio–Np, Vio–Np–Vio, and ETV guests
and CB[8] host through the host-stabilized CT complex process. These
self-assembled polymers displayed different morphologies based on
the guest molecule used (aggregates, hexagonal, and rod-like morphologies)
(Figure 7). The size
of these particles ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 μm matching well with
the DLS data and indicates the formation of larger aggregates or supramolecular
polymers.

equiv); (b) Vio–Np–Vio (1.0 mM) + CB[8] (2.0 equiv);
and (c) ETV (0.1 mM) + 3.0 equiv of CB[8] + Np–Vio–Np
in H2O.

2.7 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
The formation of supramolecular polymers
was further investigated
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 8). The existence of “antler”
shape morphology in several nanometers to micrometer length in the
case of Np–Vio–Np + 2 equiv CB[8] clearly indicated
the formation of linear supramolecular polymer in the Np–Vio–Np
molecule via self-assembly process with CB[8].14 In contrast, spherically distributed aggregate-type morphology
was observed in the case of Vio–Np–Vio + 2 equiv CB[8],
and dendritic type morphology with several micrometers was observed
for the supramolecular polymers made-up of the ETV and Np–Vio–Np
monomers via self-assembly with CB[8]. The higher dendritic size confirms
the higher degree of polymerization and the sizes are in accordance
with FESEM and particle size measurements.

polymers of (a) Np–Vio–Np

+ 2 equiv CB[8], and (c) ETV (0.50 mM) + 3 equiv Np–Vio–Np
+ CB[8] in H2O.

2.8 SAXS Measurement
The as-assembled
supramolecular polymers were analyzed by small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) technique (Figure 9). D spacing values of these polymers were calculated using
the Bragg equation (nλ = 2d sinθ, where λ = 1.54 Å). The noticeable broad scattering
peaks between 2θ = 0.5°–2.0° corresponds to
Bragg reflection with {100} and {200} facet,43,44 indicating the formation of ordered mesoporous 2D hexagonal arrangements
with p6mm symmetry.45,46 The broad peaks with d-spacing values around 5.0 and 9.0 nm further
confirmed the ordered structural arrangements. This ordered internal
periodicity is the main criteria for the existence of 2D structures.26 Hence, these observations clearly indicate that
these self-assembled polymers form 2D architecture with long-range
order. Although the DLS measurements indicate the formation of larger
aggregates, SAXS shows the evidence for the formation of 2D framework
with long-range order. All these results clearly indicate the following
possibilities,(i) the supramolecular polymerization
of the guest molecules with the CB[8] host leads to the formation
of 2D framework with long-range order, or

(ii) aggregates of these host and guest
molecules leads to the formation of an ordered network, or

(iii) a mixture of supramolecular
polymers
and their aggregates as indicated by DLS and SAXS, which is further
confirmed by morphological measurements by SEM and TEM.47

(7.0 mM), Vio–Np–Vio
(5.20 mM), and ETV (4.30 mM) in the presence of CB[8] in different
stoichiometric ratios in H2O.

2.9 Mechanism of Formation of Supramolecular Polymers
Based on the above results, we have proposed the following mechanism
for supramolecular polymerization in these three cases as shown in Figure 10.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have reported
the construction of a 2D supramolecular
organic framework using different viologen guest molecules (Np–Vio–Np,
Vio–Np–Vio, and ETV) with CB[8]. The supramolecular
interactions as well as the polymer formation were characterized by 1H NMR, UV–vis spectroscopy, CV, DOSY, DLS, SAXS, and
microscopic techniques. 1H NMR investigations clearly demonstrated
the formation of inclusion donor–acceptor complex in the hydrophobic
CB[8] cavity. It is noteworthy that the 1 equiv addition of CB[8]
resulted in the formation of an intramolecular complex where a naphthyl
or viologen unit folds back onto its corresponding donor/acceptor
moiety to form an inclusion complex with CB[8]. Further addition of
CB[8] enhances the formation of the inclusion complex via exchange
of a CB[8] molecule and results in the formation of large aggregates
as indicated by the broad peaks or disappearance of corresponding
peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. UV–vis and fluorescence
studies revealed the formation of inter/intra molecular CT complexation
between viologen guests and CB[8] host. Particle size measurement
studies revealed the formation of large self-assembled aggregates
whose size was in the order of μm. Zeta potential measurements
signified the formation of a colloid between the guest and host molecules
with good stability. DOSY measurements showed variation in the diffusion
coefficient values of uncomplexed and complexed molecules, indicating
the formation of large molecular species. FESEM analysis revealed
the formation of supramolecular polymers with different morphologies
and their diameters were in the range of μm, supplementing the
DLS results. Furthermore, SAXS analysis indicated the formation of
2D supramolecular polymer/polymer aggregate with long-range order.
Future studies will focus on the spectroelectrochemical investigations
and energy storage applications of these systems.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
starting materials
and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used
without further purification. All reactions were performed under dry
conditions. For host–guest interaction studies, synthesized
cucurbit[8] uril was used.22 For measurements
in organic media, the as-prepared viologen hexafluorophosphate salts
were used, and for the measurements in aqueous media, the corresponding
PF6– salts were anion exchanged to Br– salts by adding TBA·Br in CH3CN.

4.2 Characterization and Measurements
1H NMR, 13C NMR, and DEPT spectra were recorded
on a Bruker 500 AVANCE spectrometer at 25 °C using CD3CN or DMSO-d6 as solvents and internal
references. Elemental analyses were performed on Elementar Vario EL
III Micro cube instrument. ESI-mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan
LCQ Advantage Max, Thermofisher Instrument. Zeta potential and DLS
size distribution measurements were carried out in Nano ZS model ZEN
3600, Malvern Instrument and Microtrac-Nanotrac 250 instrument respectively.
SAXS experiments were conducted on Rigaku (Rigaku Smart Lab) using
Cu Kα radiation, the power of X-ray source was operated at 50
mA and 40 kV, and the d-spacing values were calculated
by the formula, d = 2π/q. For SAXs measurement,
thin films of the respective polymers were prepared using dip coating
method on glass plates. FESEM (Gemini Zeiss) and Transmission electron
microscope (Tecnai 20 G2 (FEImake), Netherlands) were used to analyze
the surface morphologies.

4.3 UV–Vis and Electrochemistry
Absorbance changes were measured with a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer.
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at room temperature in a standard
three-electrode cell using H2O/0.1 M KCl as solvent/electrolyte.
The working electrode was a glassy carbon disk (area = 0.07 cm2, Sinsil), and the counter electrode was a Pt wire. The reference
electrode was a Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.0 M) electrode (Sinsil) separated by
a salt bridge. Before each experiment, the working electrode was carefully
polished with alumina powder and rinsed with distilled water. Potentiostatic
control was provided by CH-Instrument and formal potentials (E0′) were calculated from cathodic and
anodic peak potentials in CVs according to E0′ = (Epc + Epa)/2. The scan rate was 0.05 V/s.

4.4 1H NMR Titrations
The 1H NMR titration
studies were carried out on a Bruker 400 MHz
spectrometer in D2O at 298 K. Aliquots of the CB[8] host
was added to the guest solution. The concentrations of the guest molecules
were Np–Vio–Np = 7.0 mM, Vio–Np–Vio =
5.20 mM, and ETV = 4.30 mM. For measurements in D2O, the
corresponding PF6 salts were ion exchanged to Br salts
by adding TBA.Br in CH3CN.

Diffusion measurements
were performed at different host concentrations using a 1H NMR pulsed gradient technique: the simulated spin-echo sequence
which leads to the measurement of the diffusion coefficient D, where D is the slope of the straight
line obtained when ln(I) is displayed against the
gradient-pulse power’s square according to the following equation:
ln(I) = −γ2G2Dδ2(Δ−δ/3),
where I is the relative intensity of a chosen resonance,
γ is the proton gyromagnetic ratio, Δ is the intergradient
delay (60 ms), δ is the gradient pulse duration (varied between
1.5 and 5 ms), and G is the gradient intensity.

4.5 Zeta Potential and Particle Size Measurements
The size distribution of the viologen CT complexed species in the
presence of CB[8] cyclic host molecule was investigated. For these
measurements, viologen guest molecule concentration (7.0 mM) was kept
constant.
