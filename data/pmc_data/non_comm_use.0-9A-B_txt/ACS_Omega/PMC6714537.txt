In this study, we investigate the
adsorption capability of molybdenum
sulfide (MoS2)/thiol-functionalized multiwalled carbon
nanotube (SH-MWCNT) nanocomposite for rapid and efficient removal
of heavy metals [Pb(II) and Cd(II)] from industrial mine water. The
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite was synthesized by acid treatment
and sulfurization of MWCNTs followed by a facile hydrothermal reaction
technique using sodium molybdate and diethyldithiocarbamate as MoS2 precursors. Morphological and chemical features of the nanocomposite
material were studied using various characterization techniques. Furthermore,
the effects of adsorbent (MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite)
concentration, contact time, initial concentration of heavy-metal
ions, and reaction temperature were examined to determine the efficiency
of the adsorption process in batch adsorption experiments. Kinetics
and isotherm studies showed that the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order
and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models, respectively. Thermodynamic
parameters calculated using van’t Hoff plots show the spontaneity
and endothermic nature of adsorption. MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
demonstrates a high adsorption capacity for Pb(II) (90.0 mg g–1) and Cd(II) (66.6 mg g–1) following
ion-exchange and electrostatic interactions. Metal–sulfur complex
formation was identified as the key contributor for adsorption of
heavy-metal ions followed by electrostatic interactions for multilayer
adsorption. Transformation of adsorbent into PbMoO4–xSx and CdMoO4–xSx complex because of
the adsorption process was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and scanning
electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectrometry. The spent adsorbent
can further be used for photocatalytic and electrochemical applications;
therefore, the generated secondary byproducts can also be employed
for other purposes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water
is the most needed molecule on the planet and is a source
of sustainable life. However, millions of people experience water
scarcity on a daily basis. Rapid growth in industrialization, population,
and urbanization has also contributed to the severe exponential increase
of water pollution because of the disposal of untreated organic/inorganic
toxic effluents into fresh waterbodies.1,2 Heavy-metal
ions (HMIs) (e.g., Zn, Pb, Hg, Ag, As, Cd, Cr, and Ni) are a class
of inorganic pollutants introduced into waterbodies through untreated
waste effluents majorly from industries such as mining, fertilizers,
batteries, pesticides, refining, tanneries, and paper and are an increasing
critical threat to healthy ecosystems.3,4 HMIs introduced
into the food chain through contaminated water may be hazardous and
life-threatening for humans, animals, and aquatic bodies after exposure
to even low concentrations (ppm).5 Due
to their toxic nature, long-term persistence, and nonbiodegradable
and bioaccumulation behavior, removing HMIs from contaminated wastewater
effluents before being discharged to waterbodies has become an important
concern.6

Lead [Pb(II)] and cadmium
[Cd(II)] are among the most toxic and
carcinogenic heavy metals released into the ecosystem through industrial
waste effluents.7,8 Pb(II) and Cd(II) are also found
to impede plant growth, interrupt uptake and transport, and affect
photosynthesis.9 The Environmental Protection
Agency has set the maximum permissible exposure limit for Pb(II) and
Cd(II) in drinking water, i.e., less than 0.015 and 0.005 mg L–1, respectively.7,10 Thus, even at trace
concentrations, they can chronically affect human beings as well as
plants. These serious issues have led to the development of advanced
methodologies and economically feasible nanomaterials for efficient
removal of heavy metals from water.

Several technologies, such
as coprecipitation, membrane filtration,
reverse osmosis, coagulation, and adsorption, have been employed for
the complete removal of HMIs from wastewater.4,11 Among
these techniques, adsorption is considered the most favorable because
of advantages such as ease of operation, cost-effectiveness, high
performance, and application to both small- and large-scale operations.12,13 Numerous adsorbents such as activated carbon,14 biomaterials,15 clay/layered
double hydroxides,16,17 hydrogels,18 zeolites,19 silica gel,20 and nanocomposites21,22 have been utilized for HMIs removal from contaminated water. However,
these nanoadsorbent materials also present some disadvantages such
as low specific active surface area and poor selectivity. Therefore,
new promising nanoadsorbents need to be identified for the elimination
of HMIs from water sources.

Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),
a carbon family member,
are graphite nanosheets rolled into a tubular structure. Because of
their high surface area, porosity, ease of functionalization, layered
and hollow structure, large-scale production, and light mass density,
MWCNTs have gained interest in water purification and are considered
as an efficient adsorbent for HMI removal.23 However, the adsorption capacity of pristine MWCNTs has been found
to be quite low; for instance, the adsorption capacity of raw MWCNTs
was recorded to be 2.94 mg g–1 for Pb(II) removal.24 Grafting functional groups through acid modification,
sulfurization, doping with metals, and constructing nanohybrid materials
with MWCNTs is the best approach to enhance the adsorption potential
of MWCNTs.25

Recently, two-dimensional
MoS2 nanosheets have also
attracted attention in many applications including adsorption due
to their large surface area, excellent chemical and thermal stability,
mechanical flexibility, and environmentally friendly nature.26−30 S atoms in MoS2 behave as soft bases and easily form
complexes with metal ions such as Pb(II) and Hg(II), which act as
soft acids.26,27 However, the absence of functional
groups on the surfaces of pristine MoS2 is a major drawback
that affects its performance as an adsorbent. In this context, Wang
et al.31 constructed MoS2–carbon
dot nanohybrids modified with magnetic ferrite as an adsorbent for
Pb(II) removal from aqueous solution. MoS2 nanostructures
with increased interlayer spacing were also prepared to achieve high
uptake of Pb(II) and Hg(II).27,32 Furthermore, MoS2 nanostructures were also modified with other nanomaterials
(such as CuS nanosheets and graphene oxide) to enhance the adsorption
potential toward targeted pollutants in water.33,34

Based on these observations, herein, MoS2 with
thiol-functionalized
MWCNT (MoS2/SH-MWCNT) nanocomposite was synthesized following
a facile hydrothermal route. During synthesis, intercalation of Na/hydrated
Na or SO42– into the MoS2 nanosheets
is helpful in the exfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets, which
enlarges the specific surface area of the nanocomposite material.
MoS2/carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanocomposites have shown
high potential for electrochemical applications, reinforcement of
polymers, and in lubrication because of the introduction of advanced
characteristics and high surface areas in the nanocomposite material.21−24 However, the possibility of MoS2/MWCNT nanocomposite
material as an adsorbent in water treatment is still unexplored.35−38 It is expected that the synergic behavior of MoS2 nanosheets
and MWCNTs would enhance the adsorption performance because of excessive
active sites. To establish the adsorption capacity of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite, the material was used as an adsorbent to
remove Pb(II) and Cd(II) from industrial mining water. The results
also prove that such nanocomposite can act as a promising adsorbent
for future environmental remediation.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Morphological
Characterization
The MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
was synthesized (Figure 1) following a facile
hydrothermal approach using commercially available MWCNTs, mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane
(MPES), sodium molybdate, and diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) as MoS2 precursors. Fourier transform infrared spectra of various
samples are presented in Figure S1, Supporting
Information (SI). Figure 2a presents the recorded X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the MWCNT, oxygenated MWCNT (O-MWCNT), and MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite in terms of intensity counts versus 2θ. MWCNT
and O-MWCNT diffractograms (JCPDS card no. 75-1621) showed one intense
diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.6°, which corresponds to the
(002) plane, and one low-intensity peak at 2θ = 43°, which
corresponds to the (100) reflection plane, and these peaks were assigned
to the graphitic structure. There were no significant changes observed
in the 2θ values of the XRD patterns when MWCNTs were oxidized
to O-MWCNTs. However, the diffraction peak intensity of O-MWCNTs was
found to be higher than that of MWCNTs, which indicates the enhanced
crystallinity of O-MWCNTs. This might be due to the removal of amorphous
carbon and other impurities during acid treatment of MWCNTs.39 Similar observations were also observed in previous
studies.40,41 XRD patterns of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite show peaks at 2θ values of 8.85, 17.53, 32.6,
and 57°, which were identified as the (002), (004), (100), and
(110) crystal planes of MoS2, respectively. Generally,
the XRD of MoS2 shows one intense peak at 14°, which
is indexed to the (002) plane representing an interlayer spacing of
6.155 Å between MoS2 nanosheets, along with other
diffraction peaks. However, the intercalation into MoS2 nanosheets shifted this peak to a lower diffraction angle (2θ).27,42 Intercalation of Na/hydrated Na or SO42– from DDC into the MoS2 nanosheets expands the interlayer
spacing from 6.155 to 10.02 Å and represents the (002) plane
diffraction peak at 8.85°. Additionally, the appearance of the
17.53° peak in the XRD spectrum of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
is assigned to the (004) plane of MoS2 nanosheets, which
confirmed the lattice expansion in MoS2 nanostructures.
The XRD spectrum of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite did
not show any peaks that could be assimilated to MWCNT, which might
be due to the low concentration and low diffraction intensity of MWCNT
in the nanohybrid material.43

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns and (b) Raman spectra of (i) MWCNT, (ii)
O-MWCNT,
and (iii) MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite.

Similar to XRD patterns, no changes were observed in the Raman
spectra of MWCNT after acid treatment (O-MWCNT) (Figure 2b). Raman spectra of the MWCNT
and O-MWCNT exhibit two sharp high-frequency bands: (a) a double-resonance
Raman mode D-band originated from scattering of local disorder due
to the amorphous carbon and defects (sp2-hybridized carbons)
at 1345 cm–1 and (b) G-bands associated with the
first-order-mode Raman signature, which is characteristic of the graphite
structure (sp2-hybridized E2g stretching of
carbons) of carbon nanotubes at 1580 cm–1. The intensity
ratio (ID/IG) quantitatively illustrates the defects and metrics of carbon nanotubes.
O-MWCNT shows a comparatively low ID/IG ratio (1.25) than MWCNT (1.30), which indicates
the removal of amorphous carbon and generation of sidewall defects
and ordered graphitic sheets after acid treatment of MWCNT.44 These sidewall defects are considered to be
caused by the oxidation of MWCNT at the side walls. Additionally,
MWCNT and O-MWCNT also exhibit a higher-frequency shoulder at 2680
cm–1 in the second-order region, which represents
the 2D band, and the overtone of the D-band but is independent of
the defects on the MWCNT. The presence of a D + G-band at 2920 cm–1 strongly supports the highly disordered graphene
sheets in MWCNT and O-MWCNT. In addition to the characteristic peaks
of MWCNT (D- and G-bands), the Raman spectrum of MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite also displays two characteristic bands at 401 and 380
cm–1, which are assigned to the out-of-plane (1Ag) and in-plane (1E2g) vibrational
modes of MoS2, respectively.33

The chemical composition and valence state of constituent
elements
in MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite were investigated by recording
the full scan survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum
(Figure 3a), which
confirmed the presence of all main elements (Mo, S, C, O, and Si)
in the nanocomposite. Furthermore, high-resolution spectra of each
element (Figure 3b–f)
present in the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite were deconvoluted
and studied thoroughly. Figure 3b depicts the high-resolution C 1s spectra, which were deconvoluted
and fitted into the five major peaks centered at 284.3, 285.1, 285.8,
287.8, and 288.5 eV. The major peak with high intensity at 284.3 eV
is assigned to the sp2-hybridized C=C carbons of
the MWCNT core skeleton. The following weak peak at 285.1 eV binding
energy represents the sp3-hybridized carbons due to the
defects on the MWCNT walls and other methylene units from MPES linked
to MWCNTs. The other peaks at 285.8 and 287.8 eV indicate the presence
of oxygen functionalities, which originate from acid treatment of
MWCNT, thus forming C–O and C=O groups, respectively,
and also representing the linkage between the MPES and MWCNTS. Another
low-intensity peak at a higher binding energy (288.5 eV) was due to
the presence of the −COOH functional group derived from the
exposure to environmental air. Oxygen functional groups were also
further confirmed by the high-resolution XPS image of O 1s (Figure 3c), which was deconvoluted
into three peaks at 530.8, 531.7, and 532.9 eV and are attributed
to the O–Si/O–Mo, C–O, and C=O functional
groups, respectively. These peaks again confirm the successful oxidation
of MWCNT through acid treatment and linkage with MPES. In addition,
the appearance of an Si 2p XPS peak (Figure 3f) at 102.3 eV reassures the grafting of
MPES and MWCNT through Si–O bonds.45Figure 3d,e displays
the high-resolution XPS images of Mo (3d) and S (2p) elements. Mo
3d XPS image (Figure 3d) can be resolved into four peaks: 228.5, 231.6, 232.9, and 235.7
eV. The well-resolved doublet at a lower binding energy around 228.5
and 231.6 eV can be ascribed to the Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo4+ 3d5/2, respectively, of the 2H-MoS2.30,46 The difference between spin–orbit
splitting of these two peaks was found to be 3.1 eV, which is attributed
to the Mo4+ oxidation states and reveals the synthesis
of MoS2 on MWCNTs. Low-intensity peaks at higher binding
energies around 232.9 and 235.7 eV correspond to the Mo6+ 3d, which might be due to the exposure of the nanocomposite to the
air and formation of MoO3 or MoO4 as a result
of oxidation.47 The XPS image of Mo 3d
also exhibits a peak at 225.6 eV, which is due to the divalent S 2s
spin orbitals. The S 2p XPS image (see Figure 3e) was deconvoluted into five major peaks
centered at 161.3, 162.6, 163.9, 168.2, and 169.4 eV. The existence
of two major peaks at 161.3 and 162.6, representing S2– 2p3/2 and S2– 2p1/2 spin
orbits, respectively, are ascribed to the S2– of
MoS2 nanosheets. One peak at a binding energy of 163.9
eV might be due to the presence of bridging disulfide S22–, which reveals the linkage between the thiol
group on MWCNTs and MoS2.48 Two
extra peaks at 168.2 and 169.4 eV can be assigned to the S6+ 2p3/2 and S6+ 2p1/2 spin orbitals
of SO42–, respectively, which might be
attributed to the intercalation of sulfate as Na2SO4/NH4SO4 between MoS2 nanosheets
during the synthesis of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite.
The intercalation of S(VI) as SO42– can
also be supported by the presence of Na (1s and 2p) and N (1s) XPS
peaks in the survey spectrum of MoS2/SH-MWCNTs. The observed
increased interlayer d-spacing further supports intercalation
of Na/hydrated Na or SO42– between MoS2 nanosheets for the MoS2(002) lattice plane in
the XRD spectrum of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite. The N
1s XPS peak might also be due to the presence of the ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) used during the synthesis of MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite.

Figure 4 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of MWCNTs (Figure 4a) and O-MWCNTs (Figure 4b), which confirm that after
acid treatment, MWCNT retains its intact structure and forms interconnected
three-dimensional (3D) network with each other. After hydrothermal
treatment of SH-MWCNTs with sodium molybdate and DDC to prepare the
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite material, MoS2 nanosheets
(Figure 4c–f)
were grown continuously on the MWCNTs network and also wrapped around
the outer surface of a few MWCNTs. Such an observation suggests the
lateral growth of MoS2 nanosheets along the MWCNTs.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images
of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite (Figure 5a–d) reveal the cross-linking 3D network
behavior of MWCNTs with few-layered MoS2 nanosheets. The
functionalization of MWCNT introduced defects and distortion in MWCNTs
(Figure 5b). The outer
diameter of MWCNTs was found to be 9–12 nm and composed of
5–10 walls (Figure 5c) inside the nanotube. The distinct lattice fringes in the
basal plane of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite with an interlayer
spacing of 0.27 nm (Figure 5d) are consistent with the (100) crystal lattice plane of
MoS2 nanosheets. Irregular wrapping of MoS2 nanosheets
on the MWCNTs causes an overlapped crystalline lattice and also creates
some crystallographic defects on the surface. Furthermore, the presence
of elemental compositions was analyzed by EDX (Figure S2), and elemental mapping was performed at the specific
area (Figure 5e), which
specified the presence of Mo and S elements for MoS2 along
with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in the MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite.

mapping of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite showing the presence

(S) in the nanocomposite.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of MWCNT
and MoS2/SH-MWCNTs is shown in Figure 6 and was examined to evaluate the surface
texture properties, porosity, and pore size distribution. Both isotherms
are classified as type IV with a distinctive H3-hysteresis loop at
a relative pressure (p/po) ≤ 0.9. This observation indicates the existence of mesoporous
and macroporous structures in samples. The sharp increase in the N2 adsorption plot of MWCNTs at a relative pressure (p/po) of >0.9 is attributed
to the microporous structure with a 13.7 nm mean pore sizes in the
sample.35 In addition, the high surface
area (256.22 m2 g–1) with high pore volume
(0.877 cm3 g–1) of MWCNTs suggests the
availability of more sites for oxidation through acid treatment and
functionalization with MPES and co-lateral growth of MoS2. In contrast, the surface area and pore volume of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite were reduced to 40.35 m2 g–1 and 0.196 cm3 g–1, respectively
(Table 1). Correspondingly,
the pore size distribution also became narrower from MWCNTs (0–240
nm) to MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite (0–136 nm). The
low surface area and pore size distribution of MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite compared to the MWCNTs suggest successful consumption
of active surface sites and partial possession of pore space on MWCNTs.49 Generally, MoS2 exhibited a quite
low surface area (<20 m2 g–1).30,50 The boosted surface area in the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
is attributed to the exfoliation of the MoS2 nanosheets,
which is also consistent with the XRD findings and provides more exposure
to the S–Mo–S edges, which contribute to surface applications.

2.2 Adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) from Contaminated
Mine Waters
2.2.1 Effect of Adsorbent Dosage
The
effect of adsorbent dosage (Figure 7a) on heavy-metal-ion removal was investigated using
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite. Different amounts of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite, ranging from 1 to 4 mg mL–1, were introduced into the mine water and stirred for 1 h to adsorb
heavy-metal ions. After 60 min of adsorption, the remaining concentrations
of Pb(II) and Cd(II) were measured in the mine water. Almost all (≥98%)
Pb(II) (Figure S3) was adsorbed within
1 h on using a dose of 2 mg mL–1 of the adsorbent.
However, only 80% Cd(II) (Figure S3) could
be removed on using 2 mg mL–1 dosages of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite in the mine water. Further increase
in adsorbent dosage did not improve the adsorption efficiency of Cd(II),
which remained almost constant (∼80%). This might be because
at large concentrations of adsorbent in the solution, the adsorbent
begins to agglomerate and the active sites cannot be properly explored
for the adsorption of contaminant from water. In addition, the diffusion
paths for contaminants increase.27 Therefore,
the optimal concentration of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
for further study was determined to be 2 mg mL–1.

Figure 7 Effect of (a) MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite dosage and
(b) pH on the adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) from mine water. Adsorption
conditions: heavy-metal concentration (Co): 100 mg L–1; temperature = 25 °C; and time
= 60 min.

2.2.2 Effect
of pH
The pH of the solution
has a significant impact on the surface charge and degree of ionization
of adsorbent, which affects the adsorption potential. To study the
effect of pH on the adsorption capacity of MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite for Pb(II) and Cd(II) removal, adsorption experiments
were performed at different pH values ranging from 2 to 6, as shown
in Figure 7b. At pH
> 6, HMIs start to precipitate as hydroxides; thus, pH experiments
were performed at pH range 2−6. Figure 7b shows that at low pH, the removal efficiency
of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite toward Pb(II) and Cd(II)
is quite low and it increases with high pH. This might be because
at low pH, most of the free oxygen moieties on the adsorbent get protonated.
Consequently, MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite with protonated
positively charged surfaces repels metal ions via electrostatic repulsion
and do not participate in complex formation, which results in low
metal-ion removal. However, on increasing the pH of the solution,
the enhanced removal efficiency of metal ions was due to the accessibility
of more adsorption sites on the adsorbent. High Pb(II) (>98%) and
Cd(II) (80%) adsorption was observed at pH 6. Therefore, for adsorption
experiments, pH 6 was considered as the optimum pH, which was also
the actual pH of mine water (Table S1).

2.2.3 Effect of Contact Time and Adsorption Kinetics
The effect of contact time on the adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II)
(100 mg mL–1) from mine water on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite (2 mg mL–1) was observed
from 0 to 150 min at room temperature. Figure 8a represents quick adsorption of heavy-metal
ions within the initial 10 min contact time between adsorbent and
adsorbate. The adsorption then gradually reached an equilibrium stage
in approximately 60 min. Fast adsorption might be attributed to the
availability of a large number of active binding sites on the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite surface. HMIs occupied most of the
vacant active surface area within 10 min of the reaction time. The
low adsorption rate observed after 10 min of contact time might be
due to the progressive decrease of adsorption binding sites on the
adsorbent and/or slow diffusion of metal ions into the inner pores.
Thus, the optimum contact time was fixed at 60 min for the rest of
the adsorption experiments.

Figure 8 (a) Effect of contact time between adsorbate
and adsorbent on the
maximum uptake of Pb(II) and Cd(II) using MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite. (b) Pseudo-first-order, (c) pseudo-second-order, and
(d) intraparticle diffusion kinetic models for the adsorption of [Pb(II)
and Cd(II)] from mine water using MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
as adsorbent. Adsorption conditions: Co = 100 mg mL–1; temperature = 25 °C; and adsorbent
dosage = 2 mg mL–1.

Furthermore, the metal-ion adsorption rate and mechanism could
be described using different kinetic models. Intraparticle diffusion,
pseudo-first-order, and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were chosen
to study the adsorption kinetics of Pb(II) and Cd(II) on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite. Pseudo-first-order kinetics follows the
physisorption process, and diffusion was considered as the rate-determining
step. Linear pseudo-first-order kinetics is expressed as eq 1 1  where Qe and Qt are the amount of adsorbed heavy-metal ion
(mg g–1) per mass of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
at equilibrium and at time t (min), respectively,
and k1 is the constant (min–1).

However, in the pseudo-second-order model, the rate-limiting
step
is usually the chemisorption process, which involves the sharing or
exchange of electrons between both interacting adsorbate and adsorbent
molecules.51 The linearized equation of
the pseudo-second-order model can be described as shown in eq 2 2  where k2 is the
pseudo-second-order kinetics constant.

The intraparticle diffusion
model is associated with the diffusion
of adsorbate to the inner pores as the rate-determining step and can
be described as eq 3 3  where kid and C signify the rate constant
(mg g–1 min–1/2) and constant
(mg g–1) for intraparticle
diffusion model, respectively.

All kinetics models were plotted
following the respective linear
equation, and the best-fit model was selected based on the value of
the highest determination coefficient (R2). Figure 8b represents
the linear plot of pseudo-first-order kinetics [t vs Ln(Qe – Qt)] for Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption, exhibiting low R2 values (0.77–0.84). A low R2 value shows that the adsorption of heavy-metal ions
using MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite is not well fitted or
follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics. However, linear fitting to t versus t/Qt plot (Figure 8c)
with high R2 values (0.99) demonstrated
that the adsorption process follows pseudo-second-order kinetics.
Moreover, Qe values (Table S2) calculated using the pseudo-second-order adsorption
kinetic model were found to be similar to experimental values (calculated
using eq 8) of adsorption
capacity. Therefore, the adsorption process of heavy-metal ions on
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite can be well explained by pseudo-second-order
kinetics and is governed by chemisorption. An intraparticle diffusion
model was also applied to the adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite and exhibited low R2 values (0.7–0.78). From Figure 8d, it is evident that the linear fitting
of the plot is not passing through the origin, which reveals that
the intraparticle diffusion model is not the rate-controlling step
during the adsorption process. Figure 8d also showed the multilinearity of the plot, which
exhibits two steps. All of the data points of metal-ion adsorption
fall on two straight lines, of which the first steep line demonstrated
the adsorption of metal ions on the most available vacant sites or
the external surface (external diffusion) on the adsorbent, whereas
the next step suggests the adsorption or metal-ion diffusion on internal
pores (intraparticle diffusion).11 All
kinetic parameters calculated for Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption on
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite from the kinetic models are
shown in Table S2.

2.2.4 Effect of Initial Heavy-Metal-Ion Concentration
and Adsorption Isotherms
The effect of the initial concentration
of Pb(II) and Cd(II) in the mine water on the adsorption efficiency
of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite was also evaluated and is
depicted in Figure 9a. The percentage of Pb(II) removal did not differ for all of the
initial concentration ranges of Pb(II) in the mine water. High adsorption
efficiency of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite was observed
(99.3%) at 20 mg L–1 initial concentration for Pb(II)
in the solution. The % removal of Pb(II) decreased slightly with an
increase in initial concentration of solution. However, more visible
changes in % metal-ion removal were observed in Cd(II) adsorption.
At lower concentration of Cd(II) in the mine water, MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite absorbs all of the Cd(II) quickly on the
available sites because of less competition between the metal ions
to be adsorbed on the binding sites. Therefore, at lower concentrations
(20–40 mg mL–1), the % removal of Cd(II)
was high and almost constant. However, with the increase in the concentration
of Cd(II) in the solution, the rate of adsorption was affected by
the low ratio of available binding sites to metal-ion concentration,
thus leading to a struggle of metal ions to bind on the limited binding
sites as binding sites became saturated. A similar trend of adsorption
was also observed using 2 mg mL–1 O-MWCNT (Figure S4a) as an adsorbent for different initial
concentrations of Pb(II) and Cd(II). However, the % removal of heavy-metal
ions using O-MWCNT as the adsorbent was found to be quite lower than
that using MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite (Figure S4b).

solution on the adsorption behavior of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite

and (c) Freundlich adsorption isotherms for the adsorption of [Pb(II)
and Cd(II)] from mine water using MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
as adsorbent. (d) Comparison of adsorption capacity of O-MWCNT and
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite for Pb(II) and Cd(II). Adsorption
conditions: time = 60 min; temperature = 25 °C; and adsorbent
dosage = 2 mg mL–1.

The adsorption isotherm was described to understand the adsorption
pattern or distribution of adsorbate onto the adsorbent as the adsorption
process attained the equilibrium. The adsorption isotherm was fitted
to Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R)
isotherm models. The two commonly used isotherm models, i.e., Langmuir
and Freundlich, and their experimental adsorption data are explained
here briefly. Calculated parameters from all isotherms and their equations
are listed in Table S3. The Langmuir isotherm
illustrates monolayer adsorption on identical sites of the adsorbent
surface with uniform energies of adsorption. It can be expressed with
the linear eq 4 4  where KL and Qm stand for Langmuir constant (L mg–1) and maximum adsorption capacity (mg g–1), respectively.

Similarly, the Freundlich isotherm considers the reversible and
multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous adsorption sites associated
with different adsorption energies. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm
can be represented by eq 5 5  where Kf denotes
the Freundlich isotherm constant (mg g–1)/(mg L–1)1/n, which is associated
with the energy of adsorption, and n is the adsorption
intensity, which provides details regarding the degree of heterogeneity.
1/n ≤ 1 suggests the feasibility of the adsorption
process.

Adsorption data were fit on all studied adsorption
isotherms and
are displayed in Figures 9b,c, S5, and S6. The best-fitting
isotherm model with the highest R2 value
could be distinguished among others (Table S2). Experimental data exhibit a better fit to the Freundlich isotherm
model (R2 0.86–0.95) than all other
studied isotherm models. Such an observation indicates the presence
of heterogeneous adsorption sites on the MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite and the behavior of multilayer coverage. Additionally,
a 1/n value using the Freundlich isotherm was calculated
to be approximately 0.54, which also shows favorable adsorption characteristics
for the adsorption of both [Pb(II) and Cd(II)] metal ions on the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite.

Moreover, the adsorption capacities
of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite [Qm, mg g–1 = 90 (Pb(II)) and 66.6 (Cd(II))] were also compared to those of
O-MWCNT [Qm, mg g–1 =
27.027 (Pb(II)) and 24.4 (Cd(II))] and other adsorbents from the literature
(Table 2) for Pb(II)
and Cd(II) removal from mine water. These observations suggest the
potential of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite for heavy-metal-ion
uptake from mine water. Adsorption data for Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions
on O-MWCNTs were also fitted on Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms,
as shown in Figure S7. Unlike the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite, O-MWCNTs were found to follow the
Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a high correlation coefficient,
indicating that the monolayer adsorption occurred on the surface with
uniform adsorption energies. The adsorption capacities of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite were found to be significantly higher
than those of O-MWCNT nanocomposite (Figure 9d), which might be attributed to the additional
functional groups (S, O, and C) in the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite,
which promotes the formation of lead–sulfur complexes. In addition,
the excellent adsorption potential of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
toward metal ions was supported by measuring the surface charge using
ζ potential. ζ potential values for O-MWCNT and MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite were found to be −26.9 and
−54.65, respectively (Figure S8).
The MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite shows a comparatively high
negatively charged surface, which supports the high interaction with
metal ions with higher adsorption capacities. Furthermore, the nature
of the adsorption process was also explained using Temkin and Dubinin–Kaganer–Radushkevich
(DKR) isotherms. A positive heat of adsorption (β) value (Table S3 and Figure S5) from the Temkin isotherm
supports the endothermic behavior of adsorption,52 and the calculated value of E (mean free
energy) from the (D–R) isotherm (E > 8
kJ
mol–1) also suggests the chemisorption nature of
adsorption.13 Therefore, these observations
proposed multilayer adsorption of metal ions on heterogeneous sites
following chemisorption.

2.2.5 Effect
of Temperature and Thermodynamic
Analysis
Temperature is also one of the key parameters to
monitor the adsorption efficiency of adsorbents. The increases in
reaction temperature affect the solubility of the heavy-metal ions
in the solution and also the kinetic energy. Therefore, the effect
of adsorption temperature on the removal of metal ions from mine water
using MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite was also investigated. Figure 10a shows that with
an increase in temperature from 25 to 55 °C, the adsorption of
metal ions also increases. Other nanoadsorbents in the literature
have also shown the same behavior for heavy-metal-ion adsorption with
temperature.62,63 This kind of behavior suggests
that the adsorption process is endothermic, which is consistent with
the Temkin isotherm observations, as explained in the previous section.
One of the possible reasons could be the high mobility of metal ions
due to enhanced thermal energy, which further supports the diffusivity
of metal ions from the external layer to the internal pores of MWCNTs.64 Increases in temperature also open the network
structure of the nanoadsorbent by providing the required activation
energy and make it more convenient for the adsorbate to pass through
and be adsorbed on the internal structure. In addition, the high temperature
of the reaction medium leads to deprotonation of the functional groups
(e.g., carboxylic acid) present on the adsorbent surface, which provide
favorable spots for metal-ion bindings.65

Figure 10 Effect of temperature of the solution on the % removal of heavy-metal
ions [Pb(II) and Cd(II)] from mine water using MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite as the adsorbent and (b) linear thermodynamic plot of
Ln Kd vs 1/T for
the adsorption of heavy-metal ions onto the MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite. Adsorption conditions: Co = 100 mg mL–1; time = 60 min; and adsorbent dosage
= 2 mg mL–1.

Additionally, to understand the effect of temperature on adsorption
behavior, three thermodynamic parameters, i.e., Gibb’s free
energy (ΔG°), entropy (ΔS°), and enthalpy (ΔH°),
were calculated following eqs 6 and 7 6   7  where Kd is the
thermodynamic constant representing metal-ion distribution at T temperature (K) and can be calculated by the ratio of
metal-ion adsorption capacity to the remaining metal-ion concentration
in the solution (Qe/Ce), and R is the universal gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1).

Equation 7 was used
to construct van’t Hoff plots (Ln Kd vs 1/T) (Figure 10b) for Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite, which helped to calculate the ΔS° and ΔH° values using
intercept and slope, respectively. All of the calculated thermodynamic
parameters for Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption are summarized in Table 3.

Adsorption of Heavy-Metal Ions on MoS2/SH-MWCNT Nanocomposite
at Various Temperatures
metal ion	temperature
(°C)	ΔG° (kJ mol–1)	ΔH° (kJ mol–1)	ΔS° (J mol–1 k–1)	
Pb(II)	25	–8.12	8.06	54.3

Cd(II)	25	–0.786	9.076	36.13	
35	–1.87	
45	–2.41	
55	–2.77	
Positive ΔH° values from the van’t
Hoff plot further confirm the endothermic behavior of the adsorption
process; hence, the amount of adsorption increases with increasing
temperature.66 Positive ΔS° values indicate the degree of freedom and increased
randomness of the adsorbate molecules at the solid–liquid interface.
Negative ΔG° values at all temperature
conditions revealed the feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption
process. A continuous decrease in ΔG°
value with increased temperature suggests that the adsorption process
is more promising at high-temperature values.

2.3 Adsorption Mechanism
Figure 11 illustrates the adsorption
mechanism of metal ions on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite.
Isotherm studies revealed that the adsorption follows the Freundlich
adsorption isotherm and hence obeys multilayer adsorption of Pb(II)
and Cd(II) on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite. Inner layer
adsorption of metal ions on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
can be attributed to the formation of the metal–sulfur complex
between the Pb(II)/Cd(II) ion and sulfur present on the MoS2 in the aqueous solution through the exchange of H+ ions.
In addition, the negatively charged surface of the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite (Figure S8) as
determined using the ζ potential analyzer favored the electrostatic
interaction between the positively charged heavy metals and the negatively
charged adsorbent. Therefore, the multilayer adsorption of metal ions
is associated with the electrostatic interaction between the Pb(II)/Cd(II)
metal ions and the negatively charged functional groups (such as −COO–, –OH, and –SH)
on the adsorbent. The formation of the metal–sulfur complex
through ion-exchange and electrostatic interactions is considered
to be the plausible mechanistic approach for metal-ion adsorption
on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite. A similar adsorption mechanism
following metal–sulfur complex formation was also illustrated
in a previous study for heavy-metal removal using MoS2 as
an adsorbent.26,27

Figure 11 Diagrammatic illustration of Pb(II) and
Cd(II) adsorption mechanism
on MoS2/SH-MWCNTs.

To gain more insights into the adsorption mechanism of Pb(II) and
Cd(II) on adsorbent (MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite), XRD
and SEM-energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) measurements of nanocomposite
samples were obtained after the adsorption experiments. On comparing
the XRD patterns of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite (Figure 2a) before and after
adsorption of HMIs [Pb(II) and Cd(II)] (Figure S9), significant changes were observed along with previous
peaks, suggesting the transformation of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
after adsorption. The intensity of the MoS2 diffraction
peak at the (002), (004), and (100) lattice planes is reduced, indicating
the intercalation of heavy metal into the layers of nanostructured
materials through ion-exchange reaction.67 Because of the low diffraction intensity of MWCNTs, the characteristic
peaks of MWCNTs could not be traced in the XRD pattern. Additional
major diffraction peaks in Pb(II)-adsorbed MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite were found to be in good agreement with JCPDS file no.
44-148668 suggesting the conversion of
Pb(II)-adsorbed MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite into PbMoO4–xSx following
the ion-exchange mechanism. The other low-intensity peaks were associated
with metastable phases. Similarly, the XRD pattern for Cd(II)-adsorbed
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite also exhibited additional significant
peaks, which correspond to the CdMoO4–xSx (JCPDS no. 07-0209).69 The additional peaks in the sample are related
to CdS nanoparticles (NPs). Moreover, the conversion of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite into PbMoO4–xSx and CdMoO4–xSx after adsorption is
also consistent with the findings of the adsorption isotherm (D–R
isotherm) and kinetic (pseudo-second-order) models, which proposed
that the adsorption process occurs via chemisorption by sharing of
electrons. Similar XRD patterns of Pb(II)-adsorbed MoS2 nanocomposite suggesting the formation of PbMoO4 after
adsorption have also been reported in the literature.27,70 The morphological changes after adsorption were studied using SEM
and EDX mapping (Figure 12). SEM images of Cd(II)-adsorbed MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite exhibited CdMoO4–xSx and CdS NPs besides MWCNTs (Figure 12a,b). EDS maps
highlight the uniform dissemination of C, Mo, O, Cd, and S throughout
the sample. Similarly, MoS2 in nanocomposite is converted
to PbMoO4–xSx NPs in the presence of Pb(II) ions (Figure 12c,d). EDS maps of Pb(II)-adsorbed MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite also support the conversion. PbMoO4 and CdMoO4 are already well-reported photocatalysts
and have been employed in several photocatalytic applications.71,72 Recently, Kumar et al.27 have confirmed
the formation of PbMoO4–xSx NPs after adsorption of Pb(II) on MoS2 nanocomposite and successfully utilized them for the photocatalytic
degradation of ciprofloxacin. Therefore, after adsorption, the generated
heavy-metal-ion-loaded MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite can
further be engaged in photocatalytic approaches.

3 Conclusions
In summary, MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite was successfully
prepared following a facile hydrothermal approach. Enhanced interlayer
spacing of MoS2 nanosheets was achieved by intercalation
of Na or hydrated Na and NaSO4 using DDC as a sulfur source.
HRTEM analyses revealed that MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
exhibits cross-linking 3D network behavior of thiol-functionalized
MWCNTs of 9–12 nm diameter with 5–10 walls and few-layered
MoS2 nanosheets. The characteristics of the adsorption
of heavy-metal ions [Pb(II) and Cd(II)] on MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite were thoroughly investigated using mining industry wastewater.
The increased interlayered spacing between the MoS2 sheets
supports more exposure of accessible sulfur sites for adsorption of
heavy-metal ions via metal–sulfur complex formation. Effects
of various adsorption parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dosage,
initial concentration of adsorbate, and temperature were also studied.
Higher adsorption capacities of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
[Pb(II) = 90.0 mg g–1 and Cd(II) = 66.6 mg g–1] compared to O-MWCNTs [Qm, mg g–1 = 27.027 (Pb(II)) and 24.4 (Cd(II))] support
the role of MoS2 in the adsorption efficiency. The adsorption
process was found to be best fitted to the Freundlich isotherm and
pseudo-second-order kinetic model, revealing a multilayer chemisorption
process. High adsorption efficiency of MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
toward heavy-metal ions is the combined effect of ion-exchange, electrostatic
interactions, and complex formation between the adsorbate and adsorbent.
Temkin isotherm and thermodynamic studies of the adsorption process
indicate the endothermic behavior of adsorption. The higher negative
ζ potential caused the superior adsorption of heavy-metal ions
on MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite. The formation of PbMoO4–xSx and
CdMoO4–xSx NPs after adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) on MoS2/SH-MWCNT
nanocomposite can further be applied in photocatalytic approaches
and revealed the potential of the nanocomposite for secondary waste
treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane
(MPES, 95%), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O, >99%), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA,
>99), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC, Na as Na2SO4 30.5–32.5%), lead nitrate [Pb(NO3)2, >99%], and cadmium acetate dihydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 98%] were procured from Sigma-Aldrich,
South Africa. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, NC7000 series)
were purchased from NANOCYL SA (Belgium). Ethanol (99.9%), sulfuric
acid (H2SO4, 98%), and nitric acid (HNO3, 37%) were obtained from Minema Chemicals, South Africa.

4.2 Functionalization of MWCNTs
Surface
oxidation of pristine MWCNTs was performed using H2SO4 and HNO3. In a typical process, 1.0 g of pristine
MWCNT was added in a 100 mL mixture of 3:1 (v/v) H2SO4 (98%) and HNO3 (37%) and bath-sonicated for 10
min. Sonication promotes the disentanglement and uniform dispersion
of MWCNT in the acid solution. Subsequently, this mixture was allowed
to reflux at 80 °C for 8 h to introduce oxygen moieties onto
the surface of MWCNT such as carboxylic acid and hydroxyl functional
groups. After oxidation treatment, the reaction was quenched and diluted
on adding 1.0 L of distilled water. Oxygenated MWCNT (O-MWCNT) was
collected through centrifugation, and all of the undigested acid was
removed by washing O-MWCNT with distilled water. Wet cake of O-MWCNT
was dried in a vacuum oven at 55 °C.

In the next step,
silanization of O-MWCNTs was performed by dispersing 2.0 g of O-MWCNT
in ethanol following bath sonication for 30 min. Concurrently, 10
mL of MPES was added to the solution dropwise with magnetic stirring
at room temperature. The reaction solution was refluxed at 70 °C
for 12 h with continuous stirring. Ethoxy groups of MPES are prone
to interact with the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on O-MWCNTs and
form thiol-terminated SH-MWCNT. After 12 h, the reaction was allowed
to cool naturally to room temperature, and silanized MWCNT (SH-MWCNT)
was collected via centrifugation. Wet cake of MWCNTs-SH was washed
with ethanol followed by distilled water and dried in an oven at 60
°C at reduced pressure.

4.3 Synthesis of Hierarchical
MoS2/SH-MWCNT
Nanocomposite
To prepare the MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite,
5.0 g of sodium molybdate dihydrate and 5.0 g of EDTA were added to
the 90 mL SH-MWCNT dispersion in distilled water, and the pH of the
reaction mixture was tuned to 9 using 1 M NaOH. The SH-MWCNT nanocomposite
dispersion in water was achieved by sonication of 1.0 g of SH-MWCNTs
in 90 mL of distilled water for 2 h. Sodium DDC (5.0 g) was also added
to the solution as a sulfur source to synthesize MoS2,
and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture
was transferred into a Teflon-lined hydrothermal chamber securely
covered by a stainless steel jacket. Hydrothermal treatment was performed
at 200 °C for 24 h. Later, the reaction was cooled at room temperature
and centrifuged to collect the MoS2/SH-MWCNT as a reaction
product. MoS2/SH-MWCNT was washed four times with distilled
water to remove all indigested chemicals and byproducts and dried
at 90 °C in an oven for 24 h.

4.4 Adsorption
of Heavy-Metal Ions [Pb(II) and
Cd(II)] from Mine Water
To address the real practical application,
water from a mine drainage from Potchefstroom, South Africa, was collected
and studied for the removal of heavy-metal ions [Pb(II) and Cd(II)]
using MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite via a batch adsorption
process. The concentrations of all possible heavy-metal ions in the
mine drainage water were evaluated (Table S1) via full scan by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectrometer (ICP-AES). Precisely, removal of Pb(II) and Cd(II) metal
ions was the focus; therefore, their concentration in mine drainage
water was spiked up to 100 mg L–1. Initially, several
experiments were run to optimize the dosage of the adsorbent required
for the maximum uptake of the metal ions from mine water. A dose of
2 mg mL–1 was considered as optimum and was gently
mixed in mine water for 60 min using a magnetic stirrer for adsorption
of the heavy-metal ions. Pb(II) and Cd(II) concentrations in mine
water were checked before and after adsorption using ICP-AES. All
adsorption experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the average
of those results was considered with an error bar. Adsorption isotherm
experiments for Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption were performed to calculate
the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent (2 mg mL–1, O-MWCNTs and MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite) using various
concentrations of Pb(II) and Cd(II) (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and
150 mg L–1) in mine water. Kinetics of Pb(II) and
Cd(II) adsorption were investigated using 2 mg mL–1 MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite in 100 mL of mine water with
100 mg L–1 concentration of either Pb(II) and Cd(II),
which was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 150 min. The
remaining concentration of heavy-metal ions at different contact times
(10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 120, and 150 min) with adsorbent was determined
to evaluate the kinetic data. To determine the thermodynamic parameters
of the adsorption process, the adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) onto
MoS2/SH-MWCNT nanocomposite was also explored at various
temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 °C).

Adsorption capacity
at equilibrium (Qe, mg g–1) and removal efficiency of heavy-metal ions (%) were calculated
following eqs 8 and 9, respectively 8   9  where Co and Ce (mg L–1) are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of heavy metals
in the solution, respectively. V symbolizes the volume
of mine water (mL) taken for the adsorption study, and m denotes the weight (g) of adsorbent used.
