Carbon-infiltrated
iron ores were prepared from a coal-tar solution
and selected calcined iron sources (i.e., goethite (FeOOH) ore, high-grade
hematite ore, and Fe2O3 reagent grain). A several
hundred micrometer thick carbon layer was deposited on the surface
of all iron sources. Because the tar solution successfully penetrated
into its nanopores, only goethite ore possessed a significant amount
of carbon in its interior nanopores. The carbon-infiltrated ores were
heated rapidly in an oxygen atmosphere in the combustion synthesis
experiments. Carbon combustion occurred at the ore surface, with the
ore temperature increasing suddenly during the experiments. Fast reduction
to metallic iron was observed only in the carbon-infiltrated goethite
ore, regardless of the oxygen atmosphere. Close contact between the
goethite ore and the carbon in its nanoporous interior facilitated
the fast reduction. The apparent reduction reaction of goethite ore
is akin to a direct reduction reaction (i.e., FeOx + C → FeOx–1 + CO).

Introduction
Most of the global
production of iron occurs in blast furnaces
(BFs). Coke for BFs is made from high-grade coal by heating it to
over 1200 °C for 20 h. However, CO2 emission from
coke ovens accounts for 18% of the total emissions from iron-making
processes.1 Clearly, a significant reduction
in CO2 emission is possible when the amount of coke used
is decreased. In this regard, some coke-free iron-making methods,
in which composites of iron oxides and carbon are utilized, have been
studied.2−6 Close contact between iron oxide and carbon is important; Kashiwaya
et al. revealed that direct reduction occurred at the interface between
iron oxide and carbon at low temperature.7

Goethite (FeOOH) ore is one of the main raw materials for
BF iron
making. FeOOH has the interesting property that it becomes a nanoporous
material when it is mildly calcined at approximately 300 °C.8−15 Chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) has been studied using nanoporous
goethite ore as a catalyst for the decomposition of tar vapor from
coal or biomass.16−20 During CVI, carbon deposition occurs by a tar decomposition reaction
involving tar vapor inside the pores. Notably, the resultant carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore is favorable for direct iron making; reduction of the
ore proceeds at relatively low temperature because the deposited carbon
and the ore wall have very close contact17 and the deposited carbon is a highly reactive type of amorphous
carbon.19 However, the amount of deposited
carbon in the goethite ore through the CVI process is only ∼5
mass %, meaning that its complete reduction to iron is not possible.
In addition to CVI, preparation of carbon-infiltrated iron ore using
various iron sources and tar has been investigated.21−23 High carbon
contents of up to 50 mass % in goethite ore are attainable using an
impregnation method, in which the ore and tar are directly mixed and
heated.23 Although such an attractive raw
material can be produced from mildly calcined nanoporous goethite
ore, the goethite ore in the actual iron-making process is heated
with coke breeze and binder at temperatures greater than 1400 °C
for 20 h to satisfy the demand of the BF, which destroys the nanoporous
structure of the goethite ore.

It is also possible to make iron
via the attractive “combustion
synthesis (CS)” method for carbon-infiltrated goethite ores
with high carbon content. CS utilizes strong exothermic reactions
to self-propagate the combustion wave to complete the reaction spontaneously;
several different types of materials have been prepared by this method.24−28 For carbon-infiltrated goethite ore, the CS reaction consists of
carbon combustion and the reduction of iron oxides. When the total
reaction is strongly exothermic, the CS reaction will be self-propagating
and rapidly reach completion. Overall, CS iron making using carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore has several benefits: (i) the amount of required coke
can be decreased, (ii) the reduction will be completed very quickly,
and (iii) the product can be used not only as an iron source but also
as a heat source for the melting process for separation from slag.

In this study, carbon-infiltrated iron ores were produced from
coal tar-based liquid and selected iron sources, including nanoporous
goethite ore. CS experiments were then conducted to reduce the carbon-infiltrated
iron ores, and the reaction mechanism was discussed in terms of the
obtained results.

Results and Discussion
Carbon-infiltrated
iron ores were prepared from the goethite ore,
the high-grade hematite iron ore, and the Fe2O3 reagent, which were precalcined in air. The goethite ore mainly
composed of FeOOH before calcination and completely decomposed to
Fe2O3 via the following dehydration reaction  For natural goethite
ore, dehydration of FeOOH
begins from 230 °C, leading to the formation of ∼4 nm
nanopores. Although nanopores exist after calcination at 800 °C,
their specific surface areas decrease drastically by calcination at
higher temperatures; temperatures of 230–400 °C are optimal
for goethite ore calcination.9 The goethite
ore used in this study was calcined under various conditions: 300
°C for 24 h, 500 °C for 1 h, 800 °C for 1 h, 1000 °C
for 24 h, and 1200 °C for 24 h. The pore size distributions,
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas, and pore
volumes are shown in Figure 1. The pore size distributions were determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method.29 Pores smaller than ∼2
nm and larger than ∼4 nm were observed in the goethite ores
calcined at 300 and 500 °C. According to Naono et al., two types
of nanopores are existent in calcined goethite ore: larger pores (∼4
nm) and smaller pores (∼1 nm).14 Larger nanopores were already present between the primary particles
in the original goethite ore, and they are comparatively stable against
calcination.14 In contrast, the smaller
nanopores formed during the decomposition reaction of goethite ore,
and they became larger during calcination at higher temperatures.14 However, the smaller pores disappeared during
calcination at 800 °C and a strong peak in the pore size distribution
curve, corresponding to a pore size of 4 nm, was obtained. This result
indicates that smaller pores grew up to ∼4 nm during calcination
at high temperature. Calcination at temperatures over 1000 °C
completely destroyed the nanopores in the goethite ore. Thus, the
goethite ore had three types of pore structures after calcination
at different temperatures: (i) pores ∼2–4 nm (300–500
°C), (ii) pores ∼4 nm (800 °C), and (iii) no pores
(1000–1200 °C).

and pore volumes

1 and 24 h.

For the carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore, precalcination at 300
°C for 24 h gave rise to 24.4 mass % of elemental C after heat
treatment with the tar solution. The ore also contained 0.64 mass
% of elemental H, indicating that the tar solution did not completely
decompose into carbon and that some of it was deposited in the form
of hydrocarbons. Fe2O3 in the goethite ore was
partially reduced to Fe3O4 after heat treatment
with the tar solution at 500 °C. Figure 2 shows cross-sectional scanning electron
microscopy (SEM)–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
images of the carbon-infiltrated ores. A several hundred micrometer
thick carbon layer formed on the surface regardless of the type of
raw material. However, only the goethite ore possessed a substantial
amount of carbon throughout. Quantitative EDS area analyses were conducted
to analyze the interior of these ores (Figure S1). A larger amount of carbon was deposited inside the goethite
ore (17.5 mass % on average) than the high-grade ore (10.0 mass %).
The deposited carbon inside the goethite ore was evenly distributed
throughout the sample, clearly demonstrating that the tar solution
successfully penetrated into the nanopores generated in the calcined
goethite ore. However, the deposited carbon mainly existed in the
macrocracks; carbon was not detected in the absence of these cracks
(see, for example, measurement areas 2 and 8 in Figure S2).

correspond to elemental carbon.

Figure 3 shows
the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and pore size distributions
of the goethite ore after calcination at 300 °C for 24 h and
the carbon-infiltrated goethite ore. Nanosized pores were observed
in the calcined goethite ore but not in the carbon-infiltrated goethite
ore. The pore size distributions of these ores indicate that the calcined
goethite ore possessed more nanopores than the carbon-infiltrated
one. These results strongly supported that carbon was successfully
deposited into the nanopores of the calcined goethite ore.

The effect of nanopores on the reduction of iron oxides was
observed
by using different iron sources and by changing the precalcination
conditions. Figure 4 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, compositions, and reduction
degrees (RD) of the samples after these CS experiments. The compositions
and the RD were determined for iron components using the reference
intensity ratio method based on the XRD results. The RD was calculated
using  First, the
effect of the type of raw material
was examined. Carbon-infiltrated goethite ore, high-grade ore, and
Fe2O3 reagent were subjected to CS conditions
of 900 °C for 10 s under a 25 vol % O2 atmosphere.
These experiments confirmed that reduction proceeded to metallic iron
only in the carbon-infiltrated goethite ore (sample 1); only Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 were observed
in the high-grade ore (sample 2) and the reagent (sample 3), and reduction
of the iron source to metallic iron proceeded only when the goethite
ore was used. The goethite ore after calcination at lower temperatures
had a nanoporous structure; the tar solution can easily infiltrate
into the pores, resulting in extensive contact between the goethite
ore and carbon. Hosokai et al. reported that nano-order contact between
iron ore and carbon is very effective for reduction.17 They produced carbon-infiltrated iron ore from precalcined
natural goethite ore and pyrolyzed biomass tar and reduced it under
an inert atmosphere.17 As a result, the
ore was reduced at lower temperature compared with the mixture of
μm sized Fe3O4 reagent and carbon black
or coke.17 The carbon-infiltrated goethite
ore used in this study was reduced to iron through such nanocontacts.
In the case of high-grade iron ore and Fe2O3 reagent, however, which did not have combined water (CW), poor contact
was made between the iron oxides and carbon, thereby limiting metallic
iron formation.

(RD)
of the products from the combustion synthesis experiments. Effects
of raw materials: goethite ore (sample 1), high-grade ore (sample
2), and Fe2O3 reagent (sample 3); effects of
goethite ore calcination temperatures: 300 °C (sample 1), 800
°C (sample 4), and 1000 °C (sample 5); and effects of atmospheres:
O2/Ar (sample 1), Ar (sample 6), and H2/Ar (sample
7) were examined.

The effect of the nanopores
was also investigated by changing the
pore structure of the goethite ore using different calcination conditions
(i.e., 300 °C for 24 h, 800 °C for 1 h, and 1000 °C
for 24 h). As seen in Figure 1, different types of pores were obtained after calcination
under these conditions. The reduction in the CS experiments proceeded
to metallic iron only in the goethite ores precalcined at 300 and
800 °C (samples 1 and 4). As stated, this can also be understood
in terms of the effect of nanocontacts between the goethite ore and
carbon. Nanopores in the goethite ore were maintained only when the
precalcination temperature was below 800 °C; carbon can be easily
deposited in such nanopores, resulting in effective contact with the
ore.

In addition, the effect of the atmosphere type was also
investigated.
Carbon-infiltrated goethite ores prepared from the goethite ore via
calcination at 300 °C for 24 h were used for this purpose. The
ores were heated at the same heating rate (of 20 °C s–1) to 900 °C under oxygen (25 vol % O2/Ar), argon
(100 vol % Ar), and hydrogen (20 vol % H2/Ar) atmospheres.
The temperature was maintained for 10 s after reaching 900 °C,
after that time the O2 and H2 gas flows were
stopped. Surprisingly, reduction of the goethite ore proceeded more
fully under the oxygen atmosphere (sample 1). In contrast, reduction
proceeded only to Fe3O4 and partially to FeO
under the argon (sample 6) and hydrogen (sample 7) atmospheres.

There was no difference in the reduction of the carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore after the CS experiments under argon and hydrogen atmospheres.
According to a previous report, hydrogen reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 occurs at 150 °C
and the reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe begins at 400
°C.30 The carbon-infiltrated goethite
ores examined in this study were heated to 900 °C and maintained
at this temperature during the CS experiments. Although it was possible
to reduce the goethite ore at 900 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere,
the previously observed effect of hydrogen on the reduction of the
goethite ore was not observed at all. This difference is attributed
to the formation of a thick, dense carbon layer on the goethite ore
surface (Figure 2),
which prevented H2 gas from contacting the goethite ore
and reducing it.

Clearly, the highest degree of reduction must
occur following carbon
combustion at the ore surface. Figure 5 shows the temperature and temperature derivative of
time during the CS experiments in oxygen (sample 1), argon (sample
4), and hydrogen (sample 5) atmospheres.

Figure 5 Temperature change and
temperature derivative of time during the
combustion synthesis experiments flowing 25 vol % O2/Ar
(sample 1), Ar (sample 4), and 20 vol % H2/Ar (sample 5)
at 900 °C with a programmed temperature (black dotted line).

In the case of the argon and hydrogen
atmospheres, the temperature
was almost identical with the programmed temperature (black dotted
line in Figure 5).
However, the temperature suddenly increased in the oxygen atmosphere,
reaching a maximum value of 1200 °C even though the temperature
was set to 900 °C. This result demonstrates that carbon combustion
occurred at the ore surface and that higher temperatures were obtained
only in an oxygen atmosphere. Further, the results suggest that heat
generated from the exothermic combustion reaction transferred to the
goethite ore, promoting reduction reactions inside it.

Figure 6 shows the
gas composition (i.e., O2, CO, CO2, H2, H2O, and CH4) of the outflow gases during
the CS experiments under an oxygen atmosphere. An increase in the
amounts of CO, CO2, and CH4 and a decrease in
the amount of O2 were observed. The increase in CO2 and the decrease in O2 occurred simultaneously,
indicating that O2 consumption was caused by the combustion
of carbon (C + O2 → CO2) at the surface
of the carbon-infiltrated goethite ore. After several seconds from
the onset of combustion, CO gas was generated, implying that it was
produced by the direct reduction reaction between iron oxide and carbon
(FeOx + C → FeOx–1 + CO). Heat treatment under Ar atmosphere indicated
that the direct reduction was dominant in the carbon-infiltrated goethite
ore (Figure S3). The formation of CH4 may be related to the decomposition of hydrocarbons. Elemental
analysis revealed that the carbon deposited in the goethite ore was
not pure C; the goethite ore contained 24.4 and 0.64 mass % of C and
H, respectively. Some of the carbon were present as hydrocarbons and
decomposed to C, CH4, and other gases at high temperature.

experiments flowing 1 L min–1 of 25 vol % O2/Ar at 900 °C (sample 1).

The cross-sectional area of the goethite ore after the CS
experiments
in an oxygen atmosphere was observed using SEM–EDS and light
microscopy (Figure 7). As seen, the thick carbon layer on the goethite ore surface, shown
in Figure 2, disappeared
due to carbon combustion. Detailed observation near the goethite ore
surface revealed that red Fe2O3 was formed;
reoxidation partially occurred where the carbon layer completely disappeared.
The ore surface without the carbon layer easily contacted oxygen,
resulting in fast oxidation. Clearly, a process to inhibit reoxidation
is essential for carbon combustion synthesis iron making. The comparatively
high Fe2O3 amounts in the samples 1 and 4, shown
in Figure 4, should
occur because of this reoxidation.

Figure 8 illustrates
the work flow of the CS iron-making process using carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore in this study. Mild calcination converted the goethite
ore to nanoporous Fe2O3. Nanocontacts between
the ore and carbon formed in the carbon-infiltrated goethite ore because
of the presence of nanopores. During the CS iron-making process, heat
generated from the exothermic carbon combustion at the ore surface
became the heat source for reduction, and the fast reduction of the
goethite ore is attributed to nanocontacts between it and carbon embedded
within its interior nanopores. In this study, metallic iron was partially
obtained via the CS process, and the highest reduction degree was
obtained when nanoporous goethite ore and oxygen were used; however,
optimization of the reduction degree would likely improve it. Further
investigations will be carried out to determine the optimum conditions
for combustion synthesis to obtain a higher degree of reduction for
this process.

process employed in this study.

Conclusions
In this study, carbon-infiltrated goethite ore
was obtained by
the tar impregnation method and it was partially reduced to metallic
iron in an oxygen atmosphere regardless of extremely short time (less
than 1 min) experiment. The conclusions of this study were as follows.

Tar impregnation and heat treatment of goethite ore produced carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore with a thick carbon layer on its surface, and the presence
of nanopores within the mildly calcined goethite ore resulted in nanocontacts
between the iron ore and carbon.

Metallic iron was generated
from the carbon-infiltrated goethite
ore after rapid heating in an oxygen atmosphere. In contrast, metallic
iron was not formed when nonporous materials (high-grade hematite
ore, hematite reagent grain, or goethite ore calcined at over 1000
°C) were used. The nanocontacts between the iron ore and carbon
successfully made reduction faster.

Metallic iron was not generated
although the carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore was rapidly heated in a hydrogen atmosphere. However,
much higher temperatures were generated in an oxygen atmosphere following
carbon combustion at the ore surface, which appears to have led to
the direct reduction reaction (FeOx +
C → FeOx–1 + CO) inside
the ore.

Overall, nanocontacts between the iron ore and deposited
carbon
on inside of the goethite ore as well as the higher temperature generated
by carbon combustion at the surface, promoted reduction of the carbon-infiltrated
goethite ore.

Experimental Section
Three raw materials
(goethite ore (Figure S1A), high-grade
iron (hematite) ore, and Fe2O3 reagent) were
used in this study. The goethite ore and high-grade
iron ore contain 57 and 65 mass % of total Fe and 8.8 and 0.77 mass
% of combined water (CW), respectively. The Fe2O3 reagent, which was used as a reference, had sizes of 2–5
mm and a purity of 99.5%. Initially, all of the raw materials were
crushed into 1–2 mm fragments and then calcined at 300 °C
for 24 h in an air atmosphere to remove the CW (Figure S1B). Coal tar was used as the carbon source. The viscosity
of tar itself is too high to infiltrate the pores of goethite ore.
For this reason, toluene (C7H8, 99.5%) was added
to the tar to reduce its viscosity. Tar and toluene were weighed at
a mass ratio of 1:1 and then stirred at 50 °C to give a tar solution.
A fraction of this tar solution (30 mL) was placed into an alumina
crucible, and 10 g of the calcined iron ores was added. The iron ores
with the tar solution were then heated at 500 °C for 1 h under
an Ar flow. The obtained carbon-infiltrated ores were then crushed
into 1–2 mm fragments (Figure S1C).

The CS experiments were conducted in a packed bed reactor.
Carbon-infiltrated
ores (100 mg) were placed into a quartz tube (φ 6 mm) and a
thermocouple was placed under the ore, with the ore temperature controlled
by a temperature controller. The ore was heated rapidly to the target
temperature at a rate of 20 °C s–1 and was
maintained at that temperature for 10 s (Figure S1D). Gases were flowed from the top to the reactor at a constant
gas flow rate of 1 L min–1 (linear velocity: 0.6
m s–1). The compositions of the flowed gases were
25 vol % O2/Ar, Ar, or 20 vol % H2/Ar. When
O2/Ar and H2/Ar were flowed, the gas flow was
immediately changed to Ar after the temperature was held for 10 s.
Samples after the CS experiments are listed in Table 1.

Temperature
changes of the samples during the CS experiments were
measured every 200 ms by a thermocouple placed directly over the ore.
Gas analysis was performed during the CS experiments every 1 s using
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Thermostar D-35614 GSD
300 T3 Gas Analyzer Spectrometer, Pfeiffer Vacuum, Aslar, Germany).
Phase identification and cross-sectional observation of the ore samples
were conducted using X-ray diffractometry (XRD; Miniflex, Rigaku,
Tokyo, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-7001FA, JEOL,
Tokyo, Japan) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The
nanostructures of the ore samples were observed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2010F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The amount
of carbon in the ore was determined using a CHN/O/S elemental analyzer
(CE-440; EAI). The pore distribution, pore volume, and BET surface
area were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements (Autosorb 6AG, Yuasa Ionics CO. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at
77 K.
