Synthetic organic dyes constitute
a major pollutant in wastewater.
Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of N-halamine nanoparticles (NPs) for decomposition of organic dyes from
contaminated wastewater. Cross-linked poly(methacrylamide) (PMAA)
NPs of hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 11 ± 1 to 161 ±
31 nm were synthesized at room temperature by redox surfactant-free
dispersion copolymerization of methacrylamide and the cross-linking
monomer N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide)
in an aqueous continuous phase. The effect of various polymerization
parameters on the diameter and size distribution of the formed NPs
was studied. Additionally, thin coatings composed of cross-linked
PMAA NPs were grafted onto oxidized corona-treated polypropylene (PP)
films by redox graft polymerization of the monomers in the presence
of oxidized PP films. The free and grafted NPs were converted to N-halamine species by chlorination with sodium hypochlorite.
The decomposition kinetics of two model organic dyes, methylene blue
(MB) and crystal violet (CV), was evaluated for both free and grafted
PMAA–Cl NPs. Free cross-linked PMAA–Cl NPs at room temperature,
with concentrations of 5 and 0.5 mg/mL, illustrated full decomposition
of CV and approximately 90% decomposition of MB after 42 and 97 h.
In order to enhance the dye decomposition, the mixtures were heated
to 70 °C. Complete decomposition of CV and MB at PMAA–Cl
NP concentrations of 5 and 0.5 mg/mL required 60 and 240 min for CV,
respectively, and 180 and 420 min for MB, respectively. Similarly,
the PP/PMAA–Cl films also demonstrated a high reduction in
the MB concentration after 150 min. Due to the highly efficient dye
decomposition, these free and immobilized chlorinated NPs may be utilized
as new reagents for decomposition of organic materials from contaminated
wastewater.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Synthetic organic dyes
are widely used in industries such as paper,
textile, leather, cosmetics, additives, food, and analytical chemistry.1,2 The environmental impact of these industries is due to the large
production of wastewater that contain organic dyes and other contaminants.3 These compounds pose a threat to aquatic life,
and their presence in drinking water has a potentially harmful effect
on public health. Furthermore, organic dyes cause coloration of water.1,4,5 Therefore, it is essential to
remove dyes from water or to treat them in order to minimize their
effect on the environment.1 Conventional
biological treatments are ineffective due to the high stability of
the dyes, which typically contain several aromatic rings.6 Different approaches were investigated for removal
of dyes from water such as physical adsorption, coagulation, biological
decoloration, oxidation processes, photo-Fenton reaction, ion exchange,
membrane filtration, and ozone treatment.1,4,7 Activated carbon is used as an adsorbent
for the removal of contaminations from wastewater. Activated carbon
has a disadvantage due to its high cost of activity regeneration.8 In recent years, intensive research has been
done on chitosan in order to commercialize it as an alternative adsorbent
to activated carbon. Chitosan, in different forms, was investigated
for a low-cost, environmentally friendly, simple, and effective adsorbent
dye removal.9 One of the most effective
methods is termed advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), whereby hydroxyl
radicals are generated in a sufficient amount for water treatment.
The radicals break the chromophoric dye molecules into smaller nonchromophoric
ones, resulting in decomposition of the dye.3,5,7,10−12 The previously published methods are not cost effective for large-scale
production; therefore, there is a need to develop efficient and environmentally
friendly methods that incur considerably lower costs.2,13

N-Halamine compounds contain one or more
nitrogen–halogen
covalent bonds; they were extensively researched in the last decades
due to their antibacterial activity.14−16N-Halamines
are relatively cheap, weakly toxic to humans and the environment,
can be regenerated, and exhibit long-term stability in aqueous solutions.16−21 The selective antibacterial activity of N-halamines
involves generation of hydroxyl radicals, reactive oxygen species
(ROS), upon exposure to organic media. Such ROS are not generated
upon exposure to water, indicating a specific mode of action.19 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report
on degradation of organic materials by N-halamine
species.

In this study, we used the advantages of N-halamines
as a new generator of AOP to deal with the problem of water contamination
by organic materials. The manuscript describes the synthesis at room
temperature of cross-linked poly(methacrylamide) (PMAA) NPs by redox
surfactant-free copolymerization of methacrylamide (MAA), a monomer
with a primary amide group with N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBAA), a cross-linking monomer
with a secondary amide, in an aqueous continuous phase using sodium
bisulfite as redox initiator. This synthesis at room temperature presents
an improvement compared to the previously reported procedure.21 The effect of various polymerization parameters
on the diameter and size distribution of the formed NPs was also studied.
Polypropylene (PP) films were subjected to a thin coating of cross-linked
PMAA NPs (PP/PMAA) using a simple and efficient method of redox graft
polymerization of the monomers MAA and MBAA onto the corona-treated
film surface. The effect of two different monomer weight ratios on
the formed grafted films was illustrated. N-Halamine
derivatives of cross-linked PMAA NPs and PP/PMAA films were produced
using household bleach. The activity of the chlorinated free and grafted
PMAA–Cl NPs in decomposition of organic materials was evaluated
using two model organic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and crystal violet
(CV).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of Cross-Linked
PMAA NPs
Cross-linked PMAA NPs were prepared by redox surfactant-free
copolymerization of MAA and MBAA at room temperature, as described
in the Experimental Section (Figure 1). The polymerization yield
of cross-linked NPs was found to be 82%, and after addition of SBS,
the yield was increased to 100%, as confirmed by HPLC analysis. The
dry and hydrodynamic size of the NPs was evaluated using high-resolution
scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and dynamic light scattering
(DLS), respectively. The dry diameter of NPs synthesized with 50%
of the cross-linking monomer MBAA was 16 ± 5 nm (Figure 2A), and their hydrodynamic
diameter was 39 ± 5 nm (Figure 2B). Larger cross-linked NPs with a dry diameter of
46 ± 12 nm (Figure 2C) and a hydrodynamic diameter of 135 ± 23 nm (Figure 2D) were also synthesized with
a higher MBAA ratio of 70%. The significantly smaller dry diameter
is probably due to the hydrophilic nature of the PMAA NPs. The hydrodynamic
diameter takes into account the water molecules adsorbed on the surface
and within the NPs, as well as the Brownian motion.22,23

NPs.

diameter histograms
of PMAA NPs synthesized with 50 and 70% of the cross-linking monomer
MBAA, respectively.

2.2 Chlorination
of Cross-Linked PMAA NPs
Conversion of the cross-linked PMAA
NPs to N-halamine-chlorinated
derivatives denoted by PMAA–Cl was performed using sodium hypochlorite,
as described in Figure 1 (either one or both hydrogen of NH2 can be substituted
by Cl atoms). The chlorine concentrations in the 5 mg/mL PMAA–Cl
NP solutions prepared with 50 and 70% of the cross-linker monomer
MBAA were found to be 19 and 25 mM, respectively. Figure 3 shows FTIR spectra of nonchlorinated
(A) and chlorinated (B) NPs; in both cases, the peaks are well-known
in the literature.16,21Figure 3A includes the expected peaks at 1212, 1532,
and 1655 cm–1, corresponding to the C–N stretching
band, the N–H band, and the carbonyl stretching band, respectively,
and the peaks at 3448 and 3473 cm–1 of NH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching, respectively. Figure 3B presents the FTIR spectrum
of the PMAA–Cl NPs, which differs slightly from the spectrum
of the nonchlorinated NPs. The peaks at 3473 and 3448 cm–1 are nearly disappeared and replaced by a new sharp peak at 880 cm–1, corresponding to the N–Cl stretching band.
The peaks in Figure 3A at 1212, 1532, and 1655 cm–1, corresponding to
C–N, N–H, and C=O vibrations, shifted slightly
to 1207, 1536, and 1668 cm–1, respectively. These
findings could probably be explained by the replacement of N–H
by N–Cl.16,21

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of (A) cross-linked PMAA
and (B) PMAA–Cl NPs.

The chlorination of the cross-linked PMAA NPs was also confirmed
using elemental analysis, as summarized in Table 1. The measurements show that the chlorination
process mainly changed the C, N, and Cl contents after chlorination
of NPs synthesized with 50 or 70% MBAA. The N content decreased by
5.7 or 4.7%, and the C content decreased by 6.2 or 4.2%. The Cl content
in both cases was increased significantly, about 11.5% (previously
0.0%), indicating that the chlorination was successful.

PMAA and PMAA–Cl NPs

PMAA–Cl	70	35.8	5.7	8.0	30.0	11.7	
2.3 Polymerization Kinetics
The kinetics
of the polymerization with 50 and 70% of the cross-linking monomer
MBAA was evaluated by following the hydrodynamic diameter and size
distribution of the produced NPs over time, as shown in Figure 4. During the first 30 min,
NPs were not detected in the reaction mixture; up to 120 min, there
was a sharp increase in the average size of the produced NPs followed
by a much milder increase over the next few hours. For example, the
hydrodynamic diameters of NPs prepared with 50% MBAA increased from
14 ± 2 to 19 ± 2 and 35 ± 4 nm after 60, 120, and 360
min, respectively. The NPs prepared with 70% MBAA showed significantly
faster growth, and after 60, 120, and 360 min of polymerization, the
hydrodynamic diameter increased from 60 ± 8 to 115 ± 17
and 131 ± 21 nm, respectively. The particles reached their final
diameter after about 24 h.

diameter and size
distribution of the formed cross-linked PMAA NPs.

2.4 Effect of Polymerization Parameters on NP
Diameter, Size Distribution, and Yield
2.4.1 [NaHSO3]/[APS] Mole Ratio
The effect of the [NaHSO3]/[APS] mole ratio was studied
for cross-linked PMAA NPs with a 1:1 mole ratio between the two monomers
(Figure 5). Figure 5A illustrates the
hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution of NPs formed with different
mole ratios; up to a ratio of 3, no detected NPs were formed in the
solution. Progressively higher ratios resulted in smaller NPs with
decreased size distribution; for example, increasing the mole ratio
from 5 to 10 to 15 resulted in significantly smaller diameters of
89 ± 12 to 48 ± 6 and 32 ± 3 nm, respectively. Figure 5B presents the yield
of the formed cross-linked PMAA NPs with different mole ratios, showing
an optimal yield of 75% at a ratio of 10, significantly higher than
the yields at ratios of 5 (57%) and 15 (63%). The present study was
then continued with this optimal mole ratio.

size and (B) polymerization yield of cross-linked PMAA NPs.

2.4.2 Effect of Total Monomer
Concentration
The effect of the total monomers concentration,
MAA and MBAA, on
the diameter and size distribution of the formed cross-linked NPs,
while maintaining a 1:1 weight ratio between the two monomers and
the other polymerization parameters constant, was investigated with
50% MBAA (Figure 6A).
Contrary to previous publications,21 the
system was relatively stable, and preparation of NPs was possible
at concentrations above 3%. Figure 6A illustrates that higher concentrations result in
increased diameters: when increasing the total monomer concentration
from 2 to 3% (w/v), the diameter and size distribution of the NPs
increases significantly from 39 ± 5 to 110 ± 16; further
increase to 4% results in a slightly larger diameter and size distribution
of 139 ± 25 nm. Experiments with monomer concentrations above
4.4% could not be performed due to insolubility of the MBAA monomer
in the continuous phase. As previously reported for dispersion polymerization,
higher monomer concentrations also lead to an increase in both reaction
rate and polymer yield. One explanation is that the initial solubility
of the reaction medium increases such that the formed oligomers grow
into longer chains before precipitating, thereby resulting in larger
particles.24,25

Figure 6 Effect of (A) total monomer concentration,
(B) MBAA weight ratio,
and (C) initiator type and concentration on the diameter and size
distribution of the formed cross-linked PMAA NPs.

2.4.3 Effect of MBAA Weight Ratio [MBAA]/([MAA]
+ [MBAA]
The effect of the MBAA weight ratio, [MBAA]/([MAA]
+ [MBAA]), on the diameter and size distribution of the formed cross-linked
PMAA NPs at a constant total monomer concentration (2%) is shown in Figure 6B. No NPs were detected
at a weight ratio below 20%. The greater weight ratio resulted in
larger NPs with greater size distribution. For example, when increasing
the weight ratio from 20 to 40 to 60% (w/w), the diameter and size
distribution increases from 11 ± 1 to 22 ± 3 to 99 ±
14 nm, respectively. This increase in diameter and size distribution
could be explained by the higher hydrophilicity of MBAA with respect
to MAA, which leads to a greater amount of absorbed water molecules
on the NPs surface, resulting in a larger hydrodynamic diameter. In
the experiment, no agglomeration was observed in contrast to previous
publications, which indicates the stability of the polymerization
system.21

2.4.4 Effect
of the Initiator Type and Concentration
The effect of the
initiator type, APS or PPS, and concentration
on the diameter and size distribution of the formed cross-linked PMAA
NPs was also studied, as shown in Figure 6C. When increasing the initiator concentration,
the diameter and size distribution of the NPs decreased. For example,
while increasing the APS concentration from 2 to 5 to 10% (w/w), the
NPs diameter and size distribution decreased from 42 ± 4 to 28
± 3 to 16 ± 2 nm. The same behavior was observed when the
PPS concentration increased from 2 to 5 to 10% (w/w). The NP diameter
and size distribution decreased from 46 ± 6 to 31 ± 4 to
18 ± 2 nm. These results are surprising, as they differ from
those previously reported for polymeric NPs composed of MAA and MBAA
monomers;21 they could be explained by
an increase in oligoradical concentration due to the higher initiator
concentration. Therefore, a greater number of smaller chains are produced
and precipitate as particles, resulting in a decrease in the particle
diameter.26−28

2.5 Graft Copolymerization
of MAA and MBAA Monomers
onto Oxidized PP Films
2.5.1 Synthesis of PP/PMAA
and PP/PMAA–Cl
Films
PP/PMAA films were prepared at room temperature by
graft dispersion copolymerization of MAA and MBAA in an aqueous phase
in the presence of an oxidized PP film, as described in the Experimental Section. The conversion of the PP/PMAA
films to the N-halamine chlorinated species, PP/PMAA–Cl.
was performed using sodium hypochlorite, as described in the Experimental Section. The chlorine concentration
on the PP/PMAA–Cl films (2 × 2 cm2) was found
to be 19 and 33 μM for films synthesized with 50 and 70% of
the cross-linking monomer MBAA, respectively. Figure 7 shows typical attenuated total reflectance
infrared (ATR-IR) spectra of PP, PP/PMAA, and PP/PMAA–Cl films,
formed with 50% MBAA. All spectra demonstrated typical peaks of the
PP film: 2953 and 1456 cm–1 corresponding to CH3 asymmetrical stretching, 2872 and 1374 cm–1 corresponding to CH3 symmetrical stretching, and 2916
and 2839 cm–1 corresponding to CH2 asymmetrical
and symmetrical stretching bands.29,30 The thin films
grafted with cross-linked PMAA NPs (Figure 7B) demonstrated new peaks, at 1213 cm–1 corresponding to C–N stretching, 1536 and
1662 cm–1 corresponding to the N–H band and
carbonyl stretching, and a broad peak at 3358 cm–1 corresponding to NH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching,
respectively. The ATR-IR spectrum of the PP/PMAA–Cl film (Figure 7C) is similar to
the spectrum of the PP/PMAA film, with two exceptions: the broad peak
at 3358 cm–1 nearly disappears, and the peaks at
1213 and 1536 cm–1, corresponding to C–N
and N–H vibrations, shifted slightly to 1206 and 1533 cm–1, respectively. These findings could probably be explained
by the replacement of the N–H bond by N–Cl.16,21,31 The ATR-IR spectra of the films
formed with 70% MBAA exhibit the same peaks shown in Figure 7.

PP, (B) PP/PMAA, and (C) PP/PMAA–Cl
films.

2.5.2 Characterization
of PP/PMAA and PP/PMAA–Cl
Films
Figure 8 demonstrates the topography of the different films, obtained by
AFM measurements −PP, oxidized PP, PP/PMAA and PP/PMAA–Cl
(prepared with 50 and 70% MBAA). Figure 8A reveals that the surface of the PP films
is quite rough, with an average Rq value of 5.7 ± 0.4 nm. Oxidized
PP films (Figure 8B)
treated by air corona showed a slightly higher roughness of 6.1 ±
0.5 nm, attributed to collisions of oxygen ions with the film that
creates pores in the PP film. After graft polymerization, cross-linked
PMAA NPs were obtained on the surface of the oxidized films. The diameter
and size distribution of the NPs were found to be 28.5 ± 2.4
and 42.1 ± 1.7 nm for 50 and 70% MBAA, respectively (Figure 8C,E), with a lower
roughness of 4.3 ± 0.5 and 5.1 ± 0.9 nm, respectively, explained
by the shape of the grafted NPs, which fill the pores on the oxidized
film surface. After chlorination, cross-linked NPs are still observed
on the films, and the surface roughness is similar to the nonchlorinated
films (Figure 8D,F).

of (A) PP, (B) oxidized PP, (C, D) PP/PMAA, PP/PMAA–Cl
(50% MBAA) and (E, F) PP/PMAA, PP/PMAA–Cl (70% MBAA) films.

The surface elemental analysis of the films obtained
by XPS measurements
is presented in Table 2. The XPS survey spectrum of the PP and oxidized PP films shows intense
carbon (C1s) and oxygen (O1s) peaks at 285 and
531 eV, respectively, along with a small peak at 400 eV corresponding
to nitrogen (N1s). The spectrum of the thin films grafted
with cross-linked PMAA NPs shows intense carbon (C1s),
nitrogen (N1s), and oxygen (O1s) peaks at 285,
400 and 531 eV, respectively. The spectrum of the PP/PMAA–Cl
films demonstrated the same peaks and an additional peak at around
200 eV, corresponding to Cl2p.32 The increased amount of N1s and O1s in the
PP/PMAA spectrum demonstrates the successful grafting of the PMAA
NPs on the PP film surface. The new peak corresponding to Cl2p, which only appeared in the spectrum of the PP/PMAA–Cl films,
indicates the successful chlorination of the PP/PMAA films to form N-halamine species.

PP, PP/PMAA, and PP/PMAA–Cl Films Obtained from XPS Measurements

The wettability properties
of the different films were measured
by a water contact angle using the sessile drop method. Table 3 exhibits the static contact
angles on PP, oxidized PP, and thin films grafted with cross-linked
PMAA and PMAA–Cl NPs. After air corona treatment, the contact
angle of the PP films decreased from 80.0 ± 1.2 to 70.3 ±
4.3° due to formation of polar groups on the surface of the films.
After graft polymerization, the PP/PMAA films showed a decrease in
contact angle to 52.5 ± 4.4 and 10.7 ± 2.8°, for films
prepared with 50 and 70% MBAA, respectively. The decrease in contact
angle after graft polymerization is probably due to the hydrophilic
nature of the cross-linked PMAA NPs grafted on the surface of the
films. The lower contact angles at the higher MBAA concentration can
be attributed to the larger diameter of the grafted NPs and the high
roughness of the film. After chlorination, the PP/PMAA–Cl films
showed an increase in the contact angle to 72.7 ± 4.2 and 64.8
± 4.0° for films prepared with 50 and 70% MBAA, respectively.
The increase in the contact angle after chlorination is probably due
to the hydrophobicity of the N–Cl bond compared to the N–H
bond.

2.6 Enhanced Decomposition of Organic Dyes by
Cross-Linked PMAA–Cl NPs and PP/ PMAA–Cl Films
2.6.1 Enhanced Decomposition of Organic Dyes by
Cross-Linked PMAA–Cl NPs
The decomposition experiments
investigated the degradation kinetics of two model dyes, MB and CV
in aqueous solutions, by the free cross-linked PMAA–Cl NPs
prepared with 50 and 70% of the cross-linking monomer MBAA. The decomposition
rates of MB and CV were evaluated by following the absorption over
time with a UV–visible spectrophotometer at 664 and 590 nm,
respectively. Figure 9 shows the decomposition rate by the cross-linked PMAA–Cl
NPs with a concentration of 5 mg/mL (Figure 9A) and 0.5 mg/mL (Figure 9B) at room temperature. The figure shows
that during the first 7 h of the experiment, there is a sharp decrease
in the rate of decomposition followed by a much milder decrease over
the following hours. After 42 and 97 h, at a concentration of 5 and
0.5 mg/mL, respectively, CV decomposed entirely, while 5–8
and 9–13% of MB did not decompose, and dyes treated with DDW
and nonchlorinated NPs showed no detected decomposition.

Figure 9 MB and CV decomposition
kinetics at room temperature by free cross-linked
PMAA–Cl NPs prepared with 50 and 70% MBAA at concentrations
of (A) 5 and (B) 0.5 mg/mL.

In order to speed up the dye decomposition, the mixtures with cross-linked
PMAA–Cl NPs were heated to 70 °C. Figure 10 demonstrates the decomposition rate at
concentrations of 5 (Figure 10A) and 0.5 mg/mL (Figure 10B), showing the same behavior observed at room temperature,
a sharp decrease in the decomposition rate followed by a much milder
decrease. Complete decomposition of CV required 60 and 240 min with
NPs at concentrations of 5 and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively, while MB required
much longer durations of 180 and 420 min. Cross-linked PMAA–Cl
NPs prepared with 70% MBAA showed lower reduction in the decomposition
rate compared to NPs prepared with 50% MBAA. This may be attributed
to the smaller size of the NPs prepared with 50% of the cross-linking
monomer, which results in a higher surface area and enhanced activity.25,33 The reduction in the dye concentration is mainly due to their decomposition
by hydroxyl radicals formed upon exposure to organic media.19 Different mechanisms of dye degradation by hydroxyl
radicals were previously reported in the literature.34−37

2.6.2 Enhanced
Decomposition of Organic Dyes by
PP/PMAA–Cl Films
The activity of thin films grafted
with cross-linked PMAA–Cl NPs for decomposition of organic
materials was also evaluated using MB as a model dye. The different
films (3.5 × 8 cm2) were shaken with an MB solution,
as described in the Experimental Section.
MB decomposition was measured after 2.5 h, and the results are shown
in Table 4. MB with
PP/PMAA films served as the control. As shown in the table, nonchlorinated
films show relatively small reduction in MB concentration (about 15%),
probably resulting from adsorption of MB on the surface of the PP/PMAA
film. On the other hand, PP/PMAA–Cl films show 83 and 76% reduction
in MB concentration for films prepared with 50 and 70% MBAA, respectively.
The reduction in MB concentration is mainly due to decomposition of
the dye by ROS.19 The PP/PMAA–Cl
films prepared with 50% MBAA have smaller NPs on the surface of the
film, resulting in enhanced activity.

3 Summary and Conclusions
Cross-linked PMAA NPs were synthesized by redox surfactant-free
copolymerization of MAA and MBAA in an aqueous continuous phase. The
effect of different polymerization parameters on the diameter and
size distribution of the produced cross-linked PMAA NPs was studied.
Thin coatings of these NPs were prepared by redox graft polymerization
of the MAA and MBAA monomers onto corona-treated PP films. The free
and grafted NPs were chlorinated to N-halamine species
using sodium hypochlorite. Decomposition experiments investigated
the degradation kinetics of two model dyes, MB and CV in aqueous solutions,
by the cross-linked PMAA–Cl NPs at both room temperature and
70 °C. Three conclusions can be derived from the results: first,
CV is more sensitive and decomposes faster than MB in the presence
of these NPs. Second, the dyes decomposition at 70 °C is faster
compared to room temperature. Third, chlorinated NPs prepared with
70% MBAA showed less decomposition compared to those prepared with
50% MBAA, in accordance with the smaller size and higher surface area
of the latter NPs. Thin films grafted with PMAA–Cl NPs showed
83 and 76% reduction in MB concentration. The results show promising
activity of the free and grafted chlorinated NPs in decomposition
of organic model dyes. These NPs and grafted films can therefore be
considered and utilized as useful new reagents for decomposition of
organic materials from contaminated wastewater.

The excellent
activity of the free and grafted N-halamine NPs in
the dye decomposition experiments is due to the
hydroxyl radicals, which are formed when the cross-linked PMAA–Cl
NPs are exposed to organic materials. Different mechanisms of dye
degradation by hydroxyl radicals were previously reported in the literature.34−37 For potential application in wastewater, it is important to know
the toxicity of the decomposition products, which may be more dangerous
than the pollutant itself. This field of research requires more experimental
evidence, since the mechanisms and exact structures of many reported
compounds have not been investigated. In a future work, we plan to
extend the present study in order to improve our understanding of
the mechanism, intermediates, and products generated during the dye
decomposition demonstrated in the present manuscript.

4.1 Materials
The
following analytical
grade chemicals were used without further purification: methacrylamide
(MAA), N,N-methylenebis(acrylamide)
(MBAA), potassium persulfate (PPS), ammonium persulfate (APS), sodium
bisulfite (NaHSO3) solution (SBS), sodium hypochlorite
solution (NaOCl, 5%), acetic acid (AcOH), sodium iodide (NaI), sodium
thiosulfate (0.1 N), methylene blue (MB) solution (1.5%), and crystal
violet (CV) solution (1%), which were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Rehovot, Israel); and PP films (air corona treated) of A4 size and
50 μm thickness, which were obtained from Hanita Coatings RCA
Ltd. (Hanita, Israel). Deionized water was purified by passing through
an Elgastat Spectrum reverse osmosis system (Elga Ltd., High Wycombe,
UK).

4.2 Synthesis at Room Temperature of Cross-Linked
PMAA NPs by Redox Dispersion Copolymerization
Cross-linked
PMAA NPs with hydrodynamic diameter ranging from 11 ± 1 to 161
± 31 nm were prepared by redox surfactant-free dispersion copolymerization
of the monomers MAA and MBAA. Figure 1 illustrates the chemical structures of the monomers
and formed cross-linked PMAA NPs. The obtained NPs contained both
primary amides (of MAA) and secondary amides (of MBAA); the resulting
two types of haloamides in the NP structure were expected to increase
the stability and binding capacity of Cl+ for each repeating
unit.21 In order to form cross-linked NPs
of a 39 ± 5 nm hydrodynamic diameter, MAA (100 mg), MBAA (100
mg), APS (6 mg), and SBS (40%, 68 μL) were dissolved in distilled
water (10 mL), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for
24 h. In order to obtain optimal yield, an additional SBS was added
to the dispersion after 24 h, and the mixture was stirred for another
24 h. Hollow fiber filtration was used to wash the resulting NPs from
excess reagents. The effect of various polymerization parameters on
the diameter and size distribution of the cross-linked NPs was also
studied. The polymerization yield was calculated by taking the ratio
of the weight of dried PMAA particles and the combined initial weights
of the two monomers.

4.3 Graft Polymerization of
MAA and MBAA onto
Oxidized PP Films
A two-step process was used in order to
prepare a thin coating of cross-linked PMAA NPs on the surface of
a PP film. In the first step, in order to improve adhesion of the
coating to the PP surface, the film was oxidized by corona treatment
with iCorona-1 (Vetaphone Corona & Plasma, Denmark) at 300 W·min/m2. In the next step, redox graft polymerization of the NPs
onto the oxidized film was conducted as follows: the film was placed
in a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 2% (w/v) of the monomers MAA
and MBAA and 3% (w/w) of the initiator APS. Two monomer weight ratios
were used. Polymerization was initiated by adding SBS with a mole
ratio of 10 with respect to APS. The mixture was then stirred at room
temperature for 24 h. The formed PP/PMAA films were washed of excess
reagents with distilled water and then dried with nitrogen gas.

4.4 Chlorination of Cross-Linked PMAA NPs and
Grafted PP/PMAA Films
4.4.1 Chlorination of Cross-Linked
PMAA NPs
The chlorinated PMAA NPs were prepared using sodium
hypochlorite,
as previously reported in the literature.21 In brief, a sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution (5 mL, 5% w/v)
was added to an aqueous dispersion of cross-linked PMAA NPs (5 mL,
15 mg/mL), and the dispersion was shaken at room temperature for 1
h. Excess sodium hypochlorite was removed from the obtained PMAA–Cl
NPs dispersion by extensive dialysis against water. The bound chlorine
content of the cross-linked PMAA–Cl NPs was determined by iodometric/thiosulfate
titration according to the literature38 as follows:  where N is the normality
(equiv/L) and V is the volume (L) of the titrated
sodium thiosulfate solution.

4.4.2 Chlorination
of Thin Films Grafted with
Cross-Linked PMAA NPs
Sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution
(25 mL, 2% w/v) was added to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing the
PP/PMAA films and shaken at room temperature for 1 h. The formed PP/PMAA–Cl
films were washed of excess reagents with distilled water and then
dried with nitrogen gas. The bound chlorine content on the PP/PMAA–Cl
films was determined by adding a coupon of the film (2 × 2 cm2) to a sodium iodide solution and measuring the colored solution
by a spectrophotometer at 292 and 350 nm.39,40

4.5 Characterization of Cross-Linked NPs and PP
Films
Dried particle diameters and size distributions were
measured with high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM,
400 L, FEI, Magellan). For this purpose, a drop of dilute NP dispersion
in distilled water was spread on a glass surface and dried at room
temperature. The average particle size and size distribution were
determined by the measurement of the diameter of more than 200 particles
by image analysis software (Image J). Hydrodynamic diameters and size
distributions of NPs dispersed in double distilled water (DDW) were
measured by a Nanophox particle analyzer (SympatecGmbH, Germany).

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was performed using a
Bruker Platinum FTIR Quick-Snap TM sampling module A220/D-01 with
13 mm KBr pellets composed of 2 mg of the detected material (cross-linked
PMAA NPs) and 198 mg KBr. The analysis of the grafted thin films was
performed by the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique. All
samples were scanned over 48 times at 4 cm–1 resolution.

Elemental analysis was performed using a Thermo FLASH 2000 organic
elemental analyzer by the analytical laboratories of the Hebrew University,
Jerusalem. Halogen content was determined using the oxygen-flask combustion
method, followed by LC20 chromatography enclosure using a Dionex IC
system.

Surface topography analysis of the unmodified and grafted
thin
films was done by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM measurements
were carried out using a Bio FastScan scanning probe microscope (Bruker
AXS, Santa Barbara, CA). All images were obtained using peak force
mode with a Fast Scan C (Bruker) silicon probe with spring constant
of 0.8 N/m. The resonance frequency of the cantilever was approximately
300 kHz (in air). Measurements were performed under environmental
conditions. Scans for each film were performed on an area of 3 ×
3 μm using the ScanAsyst mode with a 1.6 Hz scan rate. The resolution
of the images was 512 samples per line. Image processing and roughness
analysis were performed using Nanoscope Analysis software. Before
roughness analysis, the “flatting” and “planefit”
functions were applied to each image. The morphological changes of
the films were determined by the root mean square roughness (Rq) values
averaged over three different regions on each film. Diameters and
size distributions of the grafted PMAA NPs on the PP films were determined
using AFM images based on over 200 NPs.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for surface
elemental analysis of the films were conducted using a Thermo Fisher
Nexsa surface analysis system with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray
source.

Sessile drop water contact angle measurements were done
using a
goniometer (System OCA, model OCA20, Data Physics Instruments GmbH,
Filderstadt, Germany). Drops of 5 μL of distilled water were
placed on five different areas of each film, and images were captured
a few seconds after deposition. The static water contact angle values
were determined by Laplace–Young curve fitting.41 All measurements were performed at 25 °C
and 60% humidity. Unmodified and oxidized PP films were used as reference.

Decomposition of the organic dyes MB and CV was tracked by recording
the absorption spectra with a Cary 100 UV–Vis spectrophotometer
(Agilent Technologies Inc.).

4.6 Enhanced Decomposition
of Organic Dyes by
Free and Grafted Cross-Linked NPs
4.6.1 Enhanced
Decomposition of Organic Dyes by
Cross-Linked PMAA–Cl NPs
The activity of the cross-linked
PMAA–Cl NPs for decomposition of organic materials was evaluated
using two organic dyes as a model, methylene blue (MB) and crystal
violet (CV). MB and CV solutions with a final concentration of 0.1
mg/mL were prepared by dilution with DDW. A total of 1.8 mL of chlorinated
NPs at two different concentrations, 5 and 0.5 mg/mL, were added to
0.2 mL of MB or CV solutions, and the mixtures were shaken at 25 and
70 °C until all of the dye decomposed. The decomposition was
evaluated by following the absorption with a UV–vis spectrophotometer
at 664 and 590 nm, respectively. Dyes treated with DDW and nonchlorinated
NPs served as negative controls.

4.6.2 Enhanced
Decomposition of Organic Dyes by
PP/PMAA–Cl Films
The activity of the PP/PMAA–Cl
grafted films in decomposition of organic materials was also evaluated
using the organic dye MB. A solution of MB with a final concentration
of 0.001 mg/mL was prepared by dilution of the MB solution with distilled
water. The films (3.5 × 8 cm2) were placed in a petri
dish with 7 mL of the dye solution, and the plates were gently shaken
at 25 °C for 2.5 h. Decomposition of MB was evaluated by following
the absorption peak at 664 nm. MB treated with PP/PMAA film served
as control.
