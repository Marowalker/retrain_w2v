Synthesis of 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines
is developed using titanium
tetraiodide/trimethylsilyl iodide synergistically induced cyclization
of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides. The cyclization reactions
proceeded to give the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines in moderate to high
yields. Remarkable synergetic effect of titanium tetraiodide and trimethylsilyl
iodide was observed to promote the cyclization. The method was applied
to the formal synthesis of a potent analgesic agent.

Introduction
Quinazolines and their
derivatives are one of the most important
nitrogen-containing heterocycles because they often have several biological
activities.1 For example, erlotinib2 as an anticancer, CCT2415333 as a potent and selective ATP competitive inhibitor of
CHK2, and 2-arylquinazoline 1(4) as a potent analgesic agent have been reported (Scheme 1). Although a variety of synthetic
methods of quinazolines have been reported,5 the development of an efficient synthesis of 2-arylquinazolines
has been highly desired because 2-arylquinazoline derivatives have
been still well studied, e.g., as potential antiviral compounds6 and covalent lipid pocket ligands targeting p38a
MAPK mutants.7 Recently, several synthetic
methods of 2-arylquinazoline using some transition-metal catalysts
have been documented. Gogoi reported Ru(II)-catalyzed C–H activation
and annulation reaction via a carbon–carbon triple bond cleavage.8 Xu and Ji reported the efficient synthesis of
2-arylquinazolin-4-amines via a copper-catalyzed diazidation and ring
expansion cascade of 2-arylindoles.9 Some
synthetic methods of 2-arylquinazolines from 2-aminobenzonitrile and
its derivatives have been reported. Chen and He reported the synthesis
of quinazolines via an iron-catalyzed oxidative amination of N–H
ketimines.10 Chen reported the 2-arylquinazoline
synthesis using the palladium-catalyzed three-component tandem reaction
of 2-aminobenzonitrile, aldehydes, and arylboronic acids.11 Xu and co-workers reported the 2-arylquinazoline
synthesis by the rhodium(III)-catalyzed cascade [5 + 1] annulation/5-exocyclization
reaction of amidines with diynes.12 Jiang
reported the copper-catalyzed synthesis of substituted quinazolines
from benzonitriles and 2-ethynylanilines via a carbon–carbon
bond cleavage using molecular oxygen.13 Chen reported the synthesis of quinazolines using the palladium-catalyzed
tandem reaction of N-(2-cyanoaryl)benzamides with
arylboronic acids.14 Synthetic methods
using the catalyst except the transition metal have also been developed.
Xiao and Deng reported the Lewis acid-catalyzed 2-arylquinazoline
formation from N′-arylbenzimidamides and paraformaldehyde.15 Bhanage reported molecular-iodine-catalyzed
benzylic sp3 C–H bond amination for the synthesis
of 2-arylquinazolines from 2-aminobenzaldehydes, 2-aminobenzophenones, and 2-aminobenzyl alcohols.16

Scheme 1 Examples of Quinazolines Having a Biological
Activity
Titanium(IV) tetrahalides
are widely used in carbon–carbon
bond-forming reactions, for example, Diels–Alder reactions,
Mukaiyama aldol reactions of silyl enol ethers with aldehydes, and
carbonyl-ene reactions as a Lewis acid. Furthermore, low-valent titanium
halides promote reductive coupling reactions of several carbonyl compounds.
Ligands of titanium halides are bromide or chloride in most of these
reactions.17 On the other hand, titanium(IV)
tetraiodide (TiI4) had been used for the production of
high-purity metal titanium. However, its use was rare in organic synthesis.
We have focused on a reducing ability, a mild Lewis acidity, and an
iodination ability of titanium(IV) tetraiodide and have already reported
a variety of reactions such as pinacol coupling reaction, reductive
aldol, Mannich-type reactions, Prins reaction, iodo-aldol reaction,
and iodo-Mannich reaction.18 In 2009, we
reported the multisubstituted 2-iodopyridine 3 synthesis
via iodination–cyclization reactions of cyanoalkenyl-β-ketoesters 2 using TiI4 (Scheme 2a).19 In 2017,
we also developed an efficient synthetic method for 3-aryl-1-iodoisoquinolines 5 using the TiI4-induced cyclizations of cyanoketones 4 (Scheme 2b).20 On the basis of our continuous interest
in the TiI4-induced cyclizations of cyanocarbonyl compounds,
we next envisioned a synthesis of 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7 via iodination–cyclization reactions of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 6 using TiI4 because
there are few reports for the useful synthetic methods of 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines
(Scheme 2c).21 Herein, we report the synthesis of 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7 via iodination–cyclization reactions of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 6 using TiI4 and
trimethylsilyl iodide (TMSI). Moreover, to prove the utility of the
method, we applied it to the formal synthesis of the potent analgesic
agent 1.

Scheme 2 Titanium Tetraiodide-Induced Cyclization
Cycanocarbonyl Compounds
for the Synthesis of Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles
Results and Discussion
First, we
examined the titanium tetraiodide-induced cyclization
of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 8 into
2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a under similar reaction conditions
to those of 3-aryl-1-iodoisoquinolines 5 synthesis reported
previously.20 The desired 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a was not obtained along with the recovered 8 in 54% yield (Scheme 3a). When the reaction of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 8 was carried out in the presence of TiI4 in 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) under reflux, the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a was
obtained in 4% yield accompanied by the recovered 8 in
90% yield (Scheme 3b). We presumed that a proton at the amide moiety of 8 caused the low yield and the recovery of the starting material 8. We next examined the reaction of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6a having a 4-chlorophenylmethyl substituent as both a convenient
protecting group and a leaving group. The yield of 7a increased slightly to 18% along with the recovered 6a in 33% yield and 1-chloro-4-(iodomethyl)benzene (9)
in 27% yield (Scheme 3c). Therefore, several reaction conditions were next examined regarding
the titanium tetraiodide-induced cyclization of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6a to improve the yield of
2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a (Table 1).

a Isolated yields.

Among
the solvents tested, toluene was found to be a slightly better
solvent (entries 1–4). Effects of several iodide ion sources
as an additive were next investigated (entries 5–10). When
TMSI was used, the yield increased significantly to 62% (entry 10).
When the reaction of 7a was carried out using TMSI in
the absence of TiI4, the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a was not obtained and the N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6a was recovered in 59% yield accompanied by 1-chloro-4-(iodomethyl)benzene
(9) in 19% yield (entry 11). Effects of the amounts of
TiI4 and TMSI were further investigated (entries 12–18).
When the cyclization of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6a was carried out using TiI4 (2.00 equiv) and
TMSI (3.50 equiv), the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a was
obtained in 85% yield (entry 15). Finally, the effects of the protecting
group at the amide moiety were examined. The reactions of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 10a and 10b having benzyl or allyl groups at the amide moiety gave the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7a in 77 and 73% yields, respectively (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Effects of Protecting Groups
With the optimized reaction
conditions in hand, several N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 6 were subjected
to the titanium tetraiodide/trimethylsilyl iodide synergistically
induced cyclization. Scheme 5 summarizes the results. The cyclizations of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 6b (R1 = H, R2 = 4-F) and 6c (R1 = H, R2 = 4-Br) having an electron-withdrawing group afforded the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7b and 7c in 78 and 67% yields, respectively.
The cyclization of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6d (R1 = R2 = H) gave the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7d in 63% yield. The cyclization of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6e (R1 = H, R2 = Me) having an electron-donating
group worked well to afford the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7e in 57% yield. The cyclizations of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 6f (R1 = H, R2 = 2-Cl) and 6g (R1 = H, R2 = 3-Cl) gave the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7f and 7g in 59 and 61% yields, respectively.
The cyclization of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6h (R1 = H, R2 = 3,5-Cl2)
afforded the N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 7h in 69% yield. The substituents at the aminobenzonitrile moiety R1 were next investigated. The cyclizations of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamides 6i (R1 = Cl, R2 = 4-Cl) and 6j (R1 = Cl, R2 = H) having an electron-withdrawing group gave the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7i and 7j in 80 and 71% yields, respectively.
The cyclization of N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6k (R1 = Me, R2 = 4-Cl) having an electron-donating
group afforded the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7k in moderate
yield.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of 2-Aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7
Reaction conditions: 6 (0.150 mmol), TiI4 (0.300 mmol), TMSI (0.525 mmol), toluene
(3.0 mL), reflux, 14 h, under Ar, isolated yields.

A plausible reaction mechanism for the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7 formation is shown in Scheme 6. First, TiI4 would coordinate to the cyano
group of the N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-N-(2-cyanoaryl)benzamide 6 to generate intermediate 11. The titanium intermediate 12 would be formed
via a nucleophilic addition of an iodide ion to the cyano group of
intermediate 11. Subsequent intramolecular cyclization
of the titanium intermediate 12 would give the titanium
alkoxide intermediate 13. The titanium alkoxide intermediate 13 would undergo aromatization promoted by TMSI as an additive
via the elimination of [(trimethylsilyl)oxy]titanium(IV) iodide (14) and 1-chloro-4-(iodomethyl)benzene (9) to
give the 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7. Synergetic effect
of the titanium alkoxide and TMSI would be crucial for the aromatization.
The coordination of the titanium alkoxide to a silyl group would increase
a nucleophilicity of an iodide ion and promote the elimination of
[(trimethylsilyl)oxy]titanium(IV) iodide (14). 1-Chloro-4-(iodomethyl)benzene
(9) as a byproduct is obtained accompanied by 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7 in every case.

Scheme 6 Possible Reaction Mechanism
As an application, we examined the formal synthesis
of the potent
analgesic agent 1(4) from 4-iodo-2-phenylquinazoline
(7d). The SNAr reaction of 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7d with ethyl piperidine-4-carboxylate proceeded smoothly
to provide the 2-phenylquinazoline 15 in high yield (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Formal Synthesis
of the Potent Analgesic Agent 1
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a synthesis
of 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazolines 7 using titanium tetraiodide/trimethylsilyl
iodide synergistically
induced iodination–cyclization reactions of N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-N-(2-cyanoaryl)benzamides 6 as a nitrogen source, and the subsequent application to
the formal synthesis of the potent analgesic agent 1 has
been successfully achieved. The present 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline synthesis
is an attractive method because N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-N-(2-cyanoaryl)benzamides 6 as a starting material
are readily prepared from the corresponding 2-aminobenzonitrile derivatives
in two steps, and furthermore, an iodine substituent can be transformed
into other functional groups using SNAr reactions and transition-metal-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions.22

General Aspects
Melting point (mp) determinations were
performed using a YAMATO MP-21 instrument and are uncorrected. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL
JNM-ECX-400P spectrometer (400 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard. Infrared spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-460 Plus
spectrometer. 1,4-Dioxane was distilled from CaH2 and stored
over sodium. Toluene was predried with CaCl2, distilled,
and stored over molecular sieves 4 Å. Dimethylformamide was distilled
from calcium hydride and stored over molecular sieves 4 Å. Dimethylacetoamide
was distilled from KOH and CaO and stored over molecular sieves 4
Å. Pyridine was predried with KOH, distilled from KOH, and stored
over KOH. Purification of products was performed by preparative thin
layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (Wako Gel B-5F) and/or column
chromatography on silica gel (Kanto Chemical Co. Inc., Silica Gel
60 N (spherical, neutral)) and recrystallization from ethanol. All
reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere.

In
a 50 mL two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a Dimroth condenser,
and an argon balloon was placed TiI4 (0.300 mmol) in toluene
(3.0 mL) at room temperature, and to it were added TMSI (0.525 mmol)
and N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzamide 6 (0.150
mmol). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred under reflux for
14 h and then cooled down to room temperature. The reaction mixture
was quenched with phosphate buffer solution (10 mL), and EtOAc (10
mL) and 10 wt % aqueous NaHSO3 (10 mL) were added successively.
The mixture was filtered through a celite pad and extracted with EtOAc
(30 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (10 mL),
dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvents were evaporated
in vacuo, and then the residue was purified by preparative silica
gel TLC (hexane/ethyl acetate = 4:1) to give 2-aryl-4-iodoquinazoline 7.

Formal
Synthesis of the Potent Analgesic Agent 1
In
a 30 mL two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with
a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a Dimroth condenser, and
an argon balloon were placed 4-iodo-2-phenylquinazoline (7d) (20.0 mg, 0.060 mmol) and K2CO3 (10.0 mg,
0.072 mmol) in acetone (2 mL) at room temperature, and to it was added
ethyl piperidine-4-carboxylate (9.5 mg, 0.060 mmol) in acetone (1
mL). The reaction mixture was stirred under reflux for 3 h and then
cooled down to room temperature. Acetone was evaporated in vacuo,
and then the residue was diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL), washed
with H2O (10 mL), and then dried over sodium sulfate. The
solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and then the residue was purified
by preparative silica gel TLC (hexane/ethyl acetate = 1:1) to give
the 2-phenylquinazoline 15 (20.4 mg, 95%) as a colorless
viscous oil.
