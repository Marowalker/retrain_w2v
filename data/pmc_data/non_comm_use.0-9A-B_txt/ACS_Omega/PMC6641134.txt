In
this work, we have rationally designed and successfully synthesized
a reduced graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with fluorine atoms (F-rGO)
as a hole-transport layer (HTL) for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The
resultant F-rGO has an excellent dispersibility in dimethylformamide
without any surfactants, leading to a good film-forming property of
F-rGO for structuring a stable interface. The recovery of conjugated
C=C bonds in GO oxide after reduction increases the conductivity
of F-rGO, which enhances the short-circuit current density of photovoltaic
devices from 15.65 to 16.89 mA/cm2. A higher work function
(WF) (5.1 eV) of F-rGO than that of GO (4.9 eV) is attributed to the
fluorine group with a high electronegativity. Naturally, the better-matched
WF with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the PTB7-Th
(5.22 eV) donor induces an improved energy alignment in devices, resulting
in a superior open-circuit voltage of the device (0.776 vs 0.786 V).
Consequently, the device with F-rGO as the HTL achieves a higher power
conversion efficiency (8.6%) with long-term stability than that of
the devices with GO HTLs and even higher than that of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT/PSS) control device. These results clearly verify that the
F-rGO is a promising hole-transport material and an ideal replacement
for conventional PEDOT/PSS, further promoting the realization of low-cost,
solution-processed, high-performance, and high-stability PSCs.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells
(PSCs) based on bulk-heterojunction structures hold great
potential owing to their advantageous properties such as low-cost
fabrication, light weight, flexibility, and use of nontoxic elements.1 There has been significant progress in the power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs because of the tremendous efforts
in the development of new photoactive materials and fabrication techniques
over the past few years.2−4 To date, the PCE of single cells
has reached over 11%.5−9 Because the interfaces between the electrodes and the photoactive
layer play an important role in improving the overall photovoltaic
performance of PSCs, the charge-transport layers between the photoactive
layer and electrodes are notably indispensable. The functions of charge-transport
layers involved reducing energy barriers for charge carrier transport,
forming a selective contact for the corresponding charge carrier at
two electrodes, and optimizing the morphology and concentration distribution
of the photoactive layer for enhanced device performance.10,11

So far, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS), a commercial conducting polymer, has been most commonly
used as a hole-transport layer (HTL) to increase hole contact and
to improve anode collection in PSCs. However, the properties of high
acidity and hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS limit the further application
of devices.12,13 Inorganic materials including
NiO, V2O5, and MoO3, as other currently
predominant HTLs, are introduced because they could offer a high work
function (WF) with good transparency and exhibit favorable durability
for long-term device operation. However, it cannot be ignored that the requirement
of a thermal treatment and the costly vacuum process have vastly limited
their broad applications in PSCs.14,15

As a
promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS, graphene oxide (GO) possesses
numerous advantages, such as tunable electronic structures, low manufacturing
cost, and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing. GO is generally
prepared from the oxidation of graphite by a strong oxidant concentrated
sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate, which was first introduced
by Li et al.16 Herein, it is observed that the graphene sheet
in graphite oxide is decorated with oxygen functionalities at the
edges, including epoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups. Consequently,
the optoelectronic properties of GO, like the van der Waals interactions
between the graphene sheets in graphite oxide, could be tuned. In
addition, GO (rGO) with oxygen-containing functional groups is endowed
with excellent solubility in water or polar organic solvents. Thus,
it is a particularly promising solution-processable interfacial material
for application at a large scale.17−19 In spite of the aforementioned
superiority of GO, it is undisputable that GO has insulating properties
against the π–π structure of graphite being seriously damaged.
Yet, the performance of PSCs with GO interlayers is sensitive to the
thickness of GO. Thus, with the increasing thickness of GO over one
monolayer, the internal resistance of the photovoltaic device could
get increased, further the fill factor (FF) could get lowered, and
eventually the performance of PSCs could be affected.20 Therefore, some efforts have been made to improve the conductivity
of GO.17−19 Thus, the devices’ FF and performance have been significantly
improved by adding a small amount of single-walled carbon nanotubes
in the GO layer because of the improvement of conductivity.20 Moreover, the conductivity could be elevated
by partially reducing GO. However, there exist some problems; one
point is that the WF of partially reduced GO generally decreases as
a result of the removal of electronegative oxygen groups. Consequently,
the reduced GO cannot match the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) of the donor material well for the lower WF, which induces
the interface barrier, especially for the narrow-bandgap polymer donor.21 Another one is that the reduced GO with an insufficient
number of oxygen groups on the basal plane tends to aggregate in solution,
which is unbeneficial for fabricating thin uniform films by spin-coating.22,23

Herein, we developed a fluorine-functionalized, reduced GO
(F-rGO)
using 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-hydrazine as a
HTL for PSCs. In detail, the developed reductant had seven fluorine
atoms, which is less toxic in contrast to the intensively toxic and
explosive hydrazine.24,25 The resultant F-rGO presents
an excellent dispersibility (about 5 mg/mL in dimethylformamide (DMF)
without any surfactants), helpful in forming a film to develop a stable
interface. More importantly, F-rGO has both a higher conductivity
and a satisfactory WF (5.1 eV) compared to those of GO. Finally, when
applied to PSCs, the desirable PCE (8.6%) could be achieved with F-rGO
as the HTL. The good device performance contributed to the enhancement
of the short-circuit current density (16.89 mA/cm2), open-circuit
voltage (0.79 V), and FF (64.8%), meaning that F-rGO is appropriate
as a HTL for PSCs.

Results and Discussion
The hole-transport
material from reduced GO functionalized with
fluorine atoms (F-rGO) was prepared by reduction and simultaneous
functionalization of GO using a reductant, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-hydrazine,
which possesses seven fluorine atoms, as illustrated in Figure 1a. To confirm that GO has been
succeeded in reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were conducted and the change in the composition and bonding type
of GO and F-rGO was explored. The fitting results of the C1s curves of GO and F-rGO are
shown in Figure 1b,c. Figure S1 presents the XPS C1s curve. It could
be observed that the C1s spectrum of the GO film consists of several
components, assigned to C–C (284.7 eV), C–OH (286.5
eV), C–O–C (286.9 eV), and COOH (288.8 eV). However,
for F-rGO, the peak intensity of the four components evidently differs
from that of the GO, especially the enhanced intensity of C–C.
This is due to the restoration of the conjugated C=C bonds
of the GO sheets after reduction, meaning the successful reduction
of GO. Moreover, there occur another two compositions corresponding
to C–N (285.8 eV) and C–F3 (293.1 eV), revealing
that the reductant is successfully attached to the basal plane and
edges of the GO sheets. The clear chemical structure change is confirmed
by Raman spectroscopy measurements. Figure 1d shows the Raman spectra of GO and F-rGO.
The peak intensity ratio of the D and G bands is believed to be closely
related to the degree of disorder and is inversely proportional to
the size of the sp2 C domains. The observed result shows
that the ratio of ID/IG of the F-rGO increases to 1.12 (compared to 0.95 for
GO) after reduction, demonstrating that numerous small-size sp2 C domains were formed after reduction,26,27 further verifying that the GO was reduced and functionalized with
fluorine atoms successfully, consistent with the aforementioned result
of XPS. Figure 1e illustrates
the UV–visible (UV–vis) spectra of GO, which show a strong
absorbance peak at 228 nm. However, the absorbance peak of GO is red-shifted
to 265 nm and the absorbance in the whole spectral region is enhanced,
indicating that the conjugated C=C bonds of GO are restored
by reduction.28,29 More importantly, the resultant
F-rGO shows an excellent dispersibility (Figure S2) of 5 mg/mL in DMF without any surfactants. This is because
the CF3 groups from the bulky unit can effectively reduce
the van der Waals interaction and thereby prevent the graphene sheets
from aggregating in solution.30 The enhanced
dispersibility contributes to the solution processability of F-rGO.

reductants. (b, c) High-resolution XPS for C1s spectra, (d) Raman spectra of GO and F-rGO, and (e) UV–vis spectra.

To evaluate the conductivity of
the GO and F-rGO layers, we fabricated
the diodes with a structure of ITO/GO(F-rGO)/Al, as shown in Figure 2a. Note that the
different slopes of the current density–voltage (J–V) curves imply that GO(F-rGO) thin films have different electrical
conductivities. Normally, the greater the slope, the better the conductivity
of thin film. It could be seen from Figure 2a that F-rGO shows a distinct increase in
the conductivity compared to that of the pristine GO, which is attributed
to the partial restoration of conjugated C=C bonds. Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) measurements were also conducted to analyze
the morphology of GO and F-rGO (presented in Figure 2b). It could be found that the root-mean-square
roughness values of F-rGO increase slightly (from 1.49 to 1.98 nm)
after the reduction, probably ascribed to the bulky phenyl functional
groups being grafted onto the graphene sheet with disorder.19 However, from AFM topography images of photoactive
layers on different substrates (Figure S3), it could be observed that there are no obvious differences in
films’ morphologies when the photoactive layers are deposited
on different substrates. Furthermore, it is seen from the transmittance
of ITO with different HTLs (presented in Figure S4) that the F-rGO has transmittance (>80%) comparable to
that
of GO and PEDOT after reduction. More importantly, the contact angle
measurements depict that the F-rGO/ITO shows a larger contact angle
of 71.0° than that of GO/ITO (45.5°) and PEDOT/ITO (13.5°)
(given in Figure S5), owing to the decrease
of the oxygen-containing groups during reduction. The result indicates
that the enhanced hydrophobic surface of the F-rGO-modified ITO is
more compatible with the upper active layer in comparison to that
of GO-modified ITO. The above results show that the F-rGO is suitable
for anode interlayer material.

of the device). (b) AFM micrographs and root-mean-square values of
GO and F-rGO on the ITO substrate.

The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements
were
carried out to explore the WFs of GO and F-rGO. The following equation
is used to calculate the WFs of GO and F-rGO deposited onto the ITO
substrate  where hν is the excitation
energy of He(I), equals to 21.2 eV, EF is the Fermi level, and Ecutoff is the
high-binding-energy cutoff.30 It is obvious
that, compared to the WFs of bare ITO (4.5 eV), PEDOT (4.9 eV), and
GO (4.9 eV), the WF of F-rGO is significantly higher, with the value
of 5.1 eV, as shown in Figure 3a. The upshifted WF of F-rGO can be majorly due to the fluorine
atoms with a high electronegativity, inducing p-type self-doping of
the graphene.31,32 Eventually, the higher WF of
F-rGO could match the HOMO of the donor polymer (P7B7-Th, 5.22 eV)
better (Figure 3b),
leading to a better energy level alignment. Simultaneously, the built-in
potential could improve and the interface resistance reduces, thereby
enhancing the performance of PSCs.

UPS for bare ITO, PEDOT:PSS,

the device.

To assess the viability
of F-rGO as a HTL in PSCs, we fabricated
the conventional device structure (ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al, Figure 4a) based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM. Reference devices were also
prepared without any modification, with PEDOT:PSS and GO as HTLs. Figure 4a shows the current
density–voltage (J–V) characteristics
of the devices, and the related device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device without
the HTL shows a poor VOC of 0.650 V, FF
of 52.3%, JSC of 15.02 mA/cm2, and PCE of 3.3%, whereas the device with GO as the HTL demonstrates
a PCE (7.8%) with a VOC of 0.776 V, FF
of 63.9%, and JSC of 15.65 mA/cm2. It is noteworthy that the device with F-rGO as the HTL displays
an obviously improved PCE of 8.6%, with enhanced device parameters
including VOC of 0.786 V, JSC of 16.89 mA/cm2, and FF of 64.8%. The unexceptionable JSC could be attributed to the higher conductivity
of F-rGO after reduction, leading to the better carrier transport
property, whereas the slightly increased VOC is ascribed to the more matched WF (5.1 eV), promoting efficient
hole extraction with sufficient built-in potential. In addition, the
smaller Rs (Table 1) of the device with the F-rGO interlayer
just confirms the favorable hole-transport property. Figure 4b presents the external quantum
efficiency (EQE) of the devices. The JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra are 14.99, 16.19, 15.52,
and 16.59 mA/cm2, respectively, for the devices with the
bare ITO, PEDOT:PSS, GO, and F-rGO interlayers. The integrated JSC values are presented in Figure 4b, which are in good accordance
with the JSC values (within 3% mismatch)
from the J–V characteristics
under light conditions. Furthermore, the dark current densities of
the PSCs with PEDOT:PSS, GO, and F-rGO as HTLs (as shown in Figure S6) show that F-rGO is more efficient
in blocking electrons and collecting holes than PEDOT and GO. We also
measured the hole mobility of different HTLs (Figure S7) with space-charge-limited current.15 The hole mobilities of F-rGO, GO, and PEDOT are exhibited
in Table S1. Obviously, F-rGO has the highest
hole mobility among these three HTLs, contributing to the JSC enhancement.

b The best
device PCE.

To expand the
potential of F-rGO as an outstanding HTL, the device
stability of the PSCs with F-rGO was investigated with a function
of time of exposure under an ambient environment without encapsulation.
As a comparison, the device stability with GO/ITO, PEDOT:PSS/ITO,
and bare ITO as anodes was also evaluated. As shown in Figure 4c, a rapid degradation rate
could be observed for PCEs with bare ITO. After 4600 min, the device
with bare ITO continues to show a very poor PCE due to the poor surface property
of ITO. Simultaneously, the device with PEDOT:PSS retains just about
23% of its primal PCE, which originates from the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS
layer by absorbing water from the atmosphere, thus leading to the
degradation of hole extraction. In contrast, the devices fabricated
with GO and F-rGO HTLs show a greatly enhanced device stability with
the PCEs retaining 67 and 63% of their initial PCEs after 4600 min,
respectively, which is because of the GO layer, blocking water and
oxygen. The result suggests that the conventional PSCs with F-rGO
as the HTL could act as an encapsulation at both bottom to obtain a device with high
performance and long-term air stability.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we synthesized a fluorine-functionalized, reduced
GO with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-hydrazine as
a reductant. The resultant F-rGO has an excellent dispersibility,
making the subsequent solution processing feasible. Compared with
GO, F-rGO has a higher conductivity and higher WF, resulting from
the recovery of conjugated C=C bonds in GO after reduction
and the grafting of fluorine atoms with a high electronegativity, respectively. Consequently,
the F-rGO device acquires a higher efficiency than that of GO device,
with the increased short-circuit current density and open-circuit
voltage. It is worth noting that the F-rGO device even obtains an
ultimately better PCE (8.6%) in comparison to that of the device with
GO. In addition, the F-rGO-based photovoltaic device shows a stability
superior to that of the GO-based and PEDOT-based devices. These results
clearly demonstrate that the F-rGO is a promising hole-transport material
and an ideal replacement for conventional PEDOT, further promoting
the realization of low-cost, solution-processed, high-performance,
and high-stability PSCs.

Experimental Procedures
Preparation of GO
The GO was prepared by a modified
Hummer’s method. Briefly, graphite (2.0 g) was added to concentrated
sulfuric acid (50 mL, 0 °C) under stirring, then sodium nitrate
(1.0 g) was added, and the reaction system was stirred for about 0.5
h at 0 °C. Under violent agitation, potassium permanganate (8.0
g) was added slowly to keep the temperature of the mixture lower than
20 °C. Then, the suspension was transferred into a 40 °C
water bath and vigorously stirred for about 5.0 h. Subsequently, water
(100 mL) was added and the solution was stirred for 20 min at 90 °C.
An additional 360 mL of water was added. Then, H2O2 (30%, 0.5 mL) was added slowly, turning the color of the
mixture from dark brown to yellow. The suspension was filtered and
washed with 1:10 hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (200 mL) to remove
metal ions. The precipitate was dispersed into deionized water to
form a uniformly dispersed suspension. The suspension was centrifuged
(at a low speed) to remove the incompletely oxidized product. The
remaining supernatant was centrifuged (at a high speed) to obtain
the precipitate, which was freeze-dried for next use.

Preparation of F-rGO
First, 0.8 g of the prepared GO
was dispersed in 200 mL of deionized water using an ultrasonic batch
cleaner. Then, 5.1 g of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-hydrazine
was added to the suspension and stirred at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally,
the suspension was filtered and washed with methyl alcohol. The filtered
product was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 24 h.

Characterization
of Films
XPS measurements for GO and
F-rGO were performed using a Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 system.
The morphology of GO, F-rGO, and active layers was investigated using
AFM (Agilent 5500). The WFs of the samples were obtained using UPS
(Kratos Analytical Ltd.). The Raman spectra of GO and F-rGO were acquired
from LabRam-1B. The transmittance spectra and UV–vis spectrum
were analyzed by PerkinElmer Lambda 750. The current–voltage
characteristics of the devices under illumination (the light intensity
was 100 mW/cm2) and in the dark were tested by a Keithley 2400
Source Meter.

Device Fabrication
The photoactive
materials, poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]
(PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester
(PC71BM), were purchased from 1-material Inc. and Solarmer
Energy, Inc., respectively. The electron transport material, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), was provided by Solarmer
Energy, Inc. The device structure is ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The ITO glasses were cleaned by an ultrasonic batch cleaner
in acetone, soap water, deionized water, and isopropanol, successively.
Then, the ITO glasses were dried with nitrogen and treated with O3 plasma for 10 min. The interface layers of the devices were
deposited on the ITO glasses using the following spin-cast conditions.
The PEDOT layer was spin-cast from the solution at 5000 rpm for 60
s, followed by baking for 20 min at 120 °C. The GO layer was
spin-cast from its solution in water (1 mg/mL) using a gradient spin,
from 2000 to 5000 rpm for 60 s, followed by baking for 10 min at 150
°C. The F-rGO layer was spin-cast from its solution in DMF (2.0
mg/mL) using a gradient spin, from 2000 to 5000 rpm for 60 s, followed
by baking for 10 min at 150 °C. As photoactive layers, PTB7-Th
and PC71BM were spin-cast from a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane
(97:3 v/v) solution (with a total concentration of 25 mg/mL, stirred
for at least 12 h at 70 °C) at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The resulting
photoactive layer was dried in a glove box with nitrogen before the
deposition of the PFN layer. The PFN layer was spin-cast from its
solution in methanol (0.4 mg/mL) in the presence of a small amount
of acetic acid at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the devices were transferred
into a vacuum chamber for thermal deposition of Al (100 nm) at a pressure
of 10–7 Torr. The area of each device was 4 mm2, as defined by the overlap of ITO and the evaporated Al.
