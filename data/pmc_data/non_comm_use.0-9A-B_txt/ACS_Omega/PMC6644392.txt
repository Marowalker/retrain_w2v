In
this work, the molecular mechanisms for the intramolecular cycloaddition
reactions of the 1,3-dithiolium cation with adjacent alkenyl and allenyl
groups were investigated by density functional theory calculations.
Transition states for the mechanistic steps were searched, and their
connections to corresponding reactive intermediates were validated
by the intrinsic reaction coordinate method. Our studies demonstrate
that both the alkenyl and allenyl groups can readily react with a
neighboring 1,3-dithiolium cation first through a one-step asynchronous
[3 + 2] cycloaddition path, with moderate activation energy barriers
(ca. 20–30 kcal/mol) to overcome. Subsequent to the intramolecular
dithiolium–alkene/allene cycloadditions, the resulting intermediates
continue to undergo a series of reactions, including rearrangement,
ring opening, and deprotonation to eventually yield the thermodynamically
favored products, which carry a fused tricyclic molecular skeleton,
3,8-dihydro-2H-indeno[2,1-b]thiophene.
Detailed geometric and energetic properties for all of the stationary
points (transition states and intermediates) on the reaction potential
surfaces have been calculated and examined. Key transition states
and reactive intermediates were subjected to quantum theory of atoms
in molecules and natural bonding orbital calculations to elucidate
their bonding features and the stabilizing effects arising from orbital
interactions. Finally, a comparative study using the continuum solvation
model based on the charge density was conducted to evaluate the solvent
effects on the intramolecular dithiolium–alkene/allene cycloadditions,
which are the rate-limiting steps of the overall reactions. The results
show that different organic solvents (polar and nonpolar) do not lead
to much variations in the heights of activation energy barriers and
hence indicate that solvent effects are actually insignificant on
the reactions.

Introduction
Cyclization
reactions via cationic intermediates provide powerful
and efficient methods for the assembly of synthetic targets containing
various carbocyclic and heterocyclic molecular backbones.1−4 For example, nature utilizes the cyclization of cationic polyenes
to synthesize polycyclic natural products.5,6 Mimicking
such synthetic pathways, a wide range of synthetic methodologies have
been reported over the past few decades, through which complex polycyclic
motifs were successfully constructed with remarkable regioselectivity
and stereocontrol.7−16 In this context, the cyclization of stabilized carbocations continues
to appeal to and motivate synthetic chemists to develop new synthetic
methodologies, enabling the synthesis of a wide range of challenging
natural products as well as sophisticated non-natural compounds.17,18

1,3-Dithiole is a simple five-membered heterocycle, which
upon
ionization can easily afford the 1,3-dithiolium cation stabilized
by the gain of aromaticity.19−21 For this reason, the 1,3-dithiole
motif has been recurrently used in the design of many functional organic
π-systems to bring about excellent electron-donating properties,
particularly, in the structures of well-known organic π-donors,
such as tetrathiafulvalene and its various π-extended analogues.22−29 On the other hand, the chemical reactivity of the 1,3-dithiolium
cation toward different nucleophiles has not yet been extensively
surveyed. In the early literature, the chemistry of 1,3-dithiolium-4-olates
was reported to act as 1,3-dipoles reacting with certain 1,3-dipolarophiles
through classical [3 + 2] cycloaddition. For instance, Scheme 1 illustrates the cycloadditions
of 1,3-dithiolium-4-olate 1 with alkenes30−35 and alkynes36 to form bicyclic structures
(2 and 3) bearing a 2,7-dithiabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane
motif (Scheme 1a,b).

Scheme 1 Intermolecular (a,b) and Intramolecular (c,d) [3 + 2] Cycloadditions
of 1,3-Dithiolium Compounds with Alkynes and Alkene
Very recently, our group experimentally discovered
that the 1,3-dithiolium
cation could undergo intramolecular cycloadditions with adjacent alkynyl
groups in such a way as the transformation of 4 to 5 shown in Scheme 1c.37 A follow-up density functional
theory (DFT) computational study indicated that the mechanism of the
dithiolium–alkyne intramolecular cycloaddition, whether stepwise
or one-step, is dependent on the degree of π-conjugation around
the alkynyl moiety.38 We use the term “one-step”
hereafter in lieu of the commonly used “concerted” to
describe the type of mechanism that undergoes only one transition
state (TS) without the involvement of any intermediates during the
cycloaddition step. Note that, in a recent study, Domingo and co-workers
applied molecular electron density theory to reveal that the classical
concept of “pericyclic” or “concerted reactions”
is actually falsely defined.39 For the
simple monoalkyne, the cycloaddition takes places via an asynchronous
one-step [3 + 2] cycloaddition mechanism, whereas for π-conjugated
1,3-butadiyne, the cycloaddition favors a stepwise pathway with a
significantly lower activation energy barrier than the former one.
With this reactivity explained, it is reasonable to predict that the
1,3-dithiolium cation would also be reactive toward other nucleophiles
such as alkenes and allenes. Generally speaking, alkenes and allenes
are more nucleophilic in nature than alkynes are and therefore should
favor reaction with the 1,3-dithiolium cation through a mechanism
similar to the dithiolium–alkyne cycloaddition. Nevertheless,
the exact reaction pathways and major final products for the intramolecular
dithiolium–alkene/allene cycloaddition could be very different.
For instance, compound 6 in Scheme 1d is expected to give a cationic intermediate 7 that can possibly carry multiple stereocenters on its polycyclic
backbone. In this respect, the mechanism(s) of dithiolium–alkene/allene
cycloaddition may feature particular stereoselectivity and/or stereospecificity
at the intermediary stages and the final product. Moreover, in the
case of the dithiolium–alkyne cycloaddition, the intermediate 5 was found to undergo further rearrangement and ring-opening
steps to eventually form an 8H-indeno[2,1-b]thiophene structure as the final product. For the intermediate 7, however, the subsequent reactions have not yet been fathomed
and hence warrant further investigation. In this paper, the reaction
mechanisms of two selected 1,3-dithiolium cations 8-IM-1 and 9-IM-1 (Scheme 2) are investigated by DFT computational analysis. The
two dithiolium cations carry an alkenyl and an allenyl group, respectively,
which are poised for intramolecular cycloaddition with the adjacent
1,3-dithiolium group. In theory, they can be readily generated by
protonation of their dithiole precursors 8 and 9.37,38 Our study here is intended to
map out the detailed molecular mechanisms for the intramolecular cycloadditions
of the two dithiolium cations with alkenes and allenes, respectively,
as well as the subsequent rearrangement pathways toward thermodynamically
favored products.

Results and Discussion
Geometry
Optimization of Transition States and Reactive Intermediates
Prior to the thorough search and geometry optimization of all of
the transition states and reactive intermediates involved in the cationic
cycloaddition and subsequent rearrangement reactions of compounds 8 and 9, the first two transition states in the
reaction path of compound 8 and the intermediate located
in between them were calculated using three density functionals, B3LYP,
M06-2X, and ωB97XD, in conjunction with two basis sets 6-31G(d)
and 6-31++G(d,p), respectively. This preliminary study allows the
effects of density functionals and basis sets on the geometry optimization
to be examined and understood. Figure 1 compares the bond distances of the alkenyl and dithiolium
units that undergo the intramolecular cycloaddition process. The results
clearly show that the three density functionals and two basis sets
give very consistent optimized geometries. For most of the bond distances,
the deviations among the methods used are less than 2%. The largest
discrepancies are seen at the C3–C4 and C3–C5 distances
in both transition states 8-TS1 and 8-TS2 among different methods (highlighted by the dashed circles in Figure 1). For the first
transition state 8-TS1, the B3LYP and ωB97XD density
functionals predict quite similar bond distances at C3–C4 and
C3–C5, which are about 3–4% longer than the results
calculated using the M06-2X functional. For 8-TS2, the
C3–C4 and C3–C5 distances calculated by the ωB97XD
and M06-2X functionals are almost the same, but the distances calculated
by the B3LYP functional are about 6–7% longer than those by
the other two functionals. The differences can be explained by that
both M06-2X and ωB97XD functionals contain long-range and/or
empirical dispersion corrections, whereas the B3LYP method does not.
Adding dispersion corrections into DFT calculations obviously affects
the outcomes of geometry optimization,40−42 especially, for the
partially formed or broken bonds in some transition states. Nevertheless,
the popular B3LYP functional is still able to yield computational
results in good agreement with the other two newer-generation functionals.
From Figure 1, it can
also be seen that enlarging the basis set by addition of diffuse and
polarization functions has a rather negligible effect on the optimized
geometries. According to this comparative study, all of the subsequent
geometry optimizations for the transition states and intermediates
were conducted with the 6-31G(d) basis set. In these calculations,
each of the intermediates and transition states was optimized using
the B3LYP, M06-2X, and ωB97XD functionals, respectively. With
the optimized geometries in hand, single-point calculations were performed
using a larger triple-zeta basis set, 6-311+G(2d,p), to improve the
reliability and accuracy of energy calculations.

Intramolecular Alkene–Dithiolium Cycloaddition and Subsequent
Mechanistic Steps
Compound 8 upon protonation
should readily generate the cationic intermediate 8-IM1, in which the electron-rich 1,3-dithiole ring is converted into
an electron-deficient 1,3-dithiolium cation (see Scheme 3). This protonation step is
thermodynamically favored due to the gain of aromaticity on the dithiolium
ring (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information
for detailed thermodynamic data). Nuclear-independent chemical shift
(NICS) calculations100 by the gauge-independent
atomic orbital method at the M06-2X/6-311+G(2d,p) level show that
the NICS(0) value of the dithiole ring in 8 is changed
from −5.20 to −10.80 ppm upon protonation, which testifies
to a dramatic increase in aromaticity on the dithiolium ring. At this
stage, the vinyl group adjacent to the dithiolium unit is poised to
form a [3 + 2] cycloaddition transition state 8-TS1 in
a one-step manner. The intramolecular cycloaddition can occur via
two transition states, which are enantiomers to one another, as illustrated
in Scheme 3. The two
reaction pathways have the same energy profile; that is, in terms
of energy, the formation of the two enantiomers is identical. In view
of the configurations developed at the C2 and C4 positions, the one-step
cycloaddition process features an (R,R)/(S,S) stereospecificity at these
two stereocenters.

Scheme 3 Intramolecular [3 + 2] Cycloaddition of Compound 8 after
Protonation
The optimized geometries
of intermediate 8-IM1, the
(R,R) enantiomer of intermediate 8-IM2, and the transition state 8-TS1 between
them are illustrated in Figure 2. After protonation, compound 8 is converted
into cationic intermediate 8-IM1, in which the five-membered
dithiolium ring is nearly planar and it is oriented at an interplanar
angle (θ1) of 64.6° with respect to the adjacent
phenyl group as calculated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level. The vinyl
group at the ortho position also assumes a twist angle (θ2) of 40.0° relative to the phenyl ring due to steric
interactions. This twisted molecular geometry is quite consistent
with that optimized using ωB97XD/6-31G(d) (θ1 66.3°, θ2 43.1°) but noticeably differs
from the optimized geometry calculated by the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method,
in which the two twist angles are 72.5° (θ1)
and 33.6° (θ2), respectively. In the structure
of transition state 8-TS1, the dithiolium and vinyl group
come close to allow for a one-step [3 + 2] cycloaddition through contact
at the C1···C2 and C3···C5 ends. Herein,
the C1–C2 distance calculated by M06-2X/6-31G(d) is 1.892 Å,
which is much shorter than the C3–C5 distance (2.571 Å).
Again, the geometry of 8-TS1 calculated by the M06-2X
method is in general quite consistent with that of ωB97XD/6-31G(d)
and B3LYP/6-31G(d). However, the B3LYP functional tends to predict
the C1–C2 distance to be somewhat shorter and the C3–C5
distance a bit longer than the other two functionals due to the lack
of consideration of dispersion correction in B3LYP (for a detailed
comparison of geometric parameters, see the Supporting Information). Analysis based on quantum theory of atoms in
molecules (QTAIM)43 reveals two bond critical
points (BCPs), highlighted as CP1 (ρ(r) = 0.1093,
∇2ρ(r) = −0.05145)
and CP2 (ρ(r) = 0.02874, ∇2ρ(r) = 0.05503) in Figure 3C, which are located in between C1–C2
and C3–C5, respectively. The results clearly indicate that
this is a one-step [3 + 2] cycloaddition process with significant
asynchronicity; that is, the C1–C2 bond is more developed than
the C3–C5 bond in the transition state.

analysis (NPA) charges of different segments in 8-TS1 calculated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level.

It is worth noting that the C3–C4 (2.731 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d))
distance in transition state 8-TS1 is only slightly longer
than that of C3–C5 (2.571 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d)), suggesting
that the C4 end also plays a significant role in transition-state
formation. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis shown in Figure 3A depicts the π
bond of C4–C5 (donor) and the empty p orbital of C3 (acceptor),
which interact with one another to give 35.52 kcal/mol of stabilization
energy to transition state 8-TS1 according to calculations
done at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory. Figure 3B schematically illustrates the donor–acceptor
orbital overlap by canonical structure drawing, in which the alkenyl
carbon (C3) is clearly seen to develop carbocation character in 8-TS1. It is proposed that during transition-state formation,
the π-electron density of the alkenyl group (C2–C3) is
considerably depleted as a result of orbital overlaps with the electron-withdrawing
dithiolium ring. Natural population analysis (NPA) calculated at the
M06-2X/6-31G(d) level further corroborates this proposition. As shown
in Figure 3D, the total
NPA charge of the alkenyl group in 8-TS1 is calculated
to be +0.268, which is far greater than that of its precursor 8-IM1 (+0.042). Meanwhile, the total NPA charge of the dithiolium
moiety (+0.508) in 8-TS1 is significantly attenuated
in comparison to that of 8-IM1 (+0.839). The electron
density analysis shows that, in the cycloaddition transition state,
the charge is more dispersed (delocalized) among the dithiolium and
alkene units, which is in line with the dramatic change in molecular
net dipole moment from 8-IM1 (6.310 debye) to 8-TS1 (4.326 debye). Domingo et al. recently reported that for polar or
ionic [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions global electron density transfer
takes place.44,45

The activation energy barriers
for the intramolecular alkene–dithiolium
cycloaddtion and subsequent mechanistic steps are shown in Figure 4. In the calculations,
each of the intermediates and transition states was first optimized
using the M06-2X, ωB97XD, and B3LYP functionals, respectively,
with the 6-31G(d) basis set being used. For each of the optimized
structure, single-point and frequency calculations were then performed
using the same functional as used for geometry optimization, but with
a larger basis set, 6-311+G(2d,p), to calculate the thermodynamic
energies.

Figure 4 Relative Gibbs free energies of the transition states and intermediates
involved in the reaction pathways of 8-IM1.

As can be seen from Figure 4, the Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG‡) for the first cycloaddition step is
calculated
to be 32.1 kcal/mol by the M06-2X method and 32.8 kcal/mol by the
ωB97XD method, which are in good agreement with one another.
The ΔG‡ calculated by the
B3LYP density functional, however, is slightly higher (by ca. 3–4
kcal/mol) than the values calculated by the M06-2X and ωB97XD
methods. It has been noted that taking empirical dispersion correction
for DFT helps improving the performance on energy barrier calculations.46 Hence, the ΔG‡ values calculated using the modern functionals such as M06-2X and
ωB97XD are therefore regarded as being more accurate and trustworthy
than those obtained from the B3LYP functional. The cycloaddition step
leads to the formation of a five-membered ring (C1–C2–C3–C5–S6)
in the structure of 8-IM2. It is worth noting that the
C4–S7 bond in 8-IM2 is significantly shorter than
the other C–S bonds by ca. 0.2 Å, manifesting a C=S
double bond character in line with the canonical structure drawn in Scheme 3. Intermediate 8-IM2 then undergoes a rearrangement process via the cage-shaped
transition state 8-TS2, in which the C3–C4/C3–C5
bonds as well as the C4–S7/C5–S6 bonds are nearly of
the same bond distance, respectively. The ΔG‡ calculated for this step is 19.3 kcal/mol at
both the B3LYP and ωB97XD levels and 17.8 kcal/mol at the M06-2X
level. Through transition state 8-TS2, intermediate 8-IM2 then rearranges to form another cationic intermediate 8-IM3 via a 1,2-σ bond migration, which shifts the C3–C5
bond to the C3–C4 position. Intermediate 8-IM3 is then poised to undergo a ring-opening step by breaking the C1–S6
bond. The activation energy barrier of this bond cleavage is very
shallow: 6.3 kcal/mol calculated by M06-2X, 6.1 kcal/mol by ωB97XD,
and only 2.2 kcal/mol by B3LYP. NBO analysis on the transition state
of this ring-opening step (8-TS4) reveals two major donor–acceptor
orbital interactions, which contribute to stabilizing this transition
state. As shown in Figure 5, the hyperconjugation effect between the σ(C2–H8)
bond and the antibonding orbital of π(C1–S7) delivers
17.4 kcal/mol of stabilization energy. Another set of orbital interactions
comes from the lone pair orbital of S6 and the antibonding orbital
of π(C1–S7), giving rise to 27.1 kcal/mol of stabilization
energy. Apparently, the nearly antiparallel orientation of the σ(C2–H8)
bond with respect to the C1–S6 bond in 8-IM3 greatly
facilitates the C1–S6 bond breaking. The resulting intermediate 8-IM5 contains a five-membered dihydrothiophenium ring in
which the C1–S7 bond is shorter than the C4–S7 bond
by ca. 0.2 Å, indicating that the C1–S7 bond possesses
some double bond character and C1 is a carbocation stabilized by the
resonance effect facilitated by the adjacent S7 atom. Finally, intermediate 8-IM5 can undergo a straightforward deprotonation step to
yield product 8-P, which is thermodynamically favored.
It is also noted that cationic intermediates 8-IM4 and 8-IM5 are both less stable than 8-IM1 and the
loss of the aromatic 1,3-dithiolium ring during the reaction steps
is believed to be a major energetic contributor.

(B) Plots of NBOs representing the σ(C–H) and π*(C=S)
orbital interactions. (C) Plots of NBOs representing the Lp(S) and
π*(C=S) orbital interactions. NBO analysis was performed
at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level, and orbitals are plotted with the isovalue
of 0.06.

In addition to 8-TS2, another transition state 8-TS3 was also found by DFT
calculations, which allows intermediate 8-IM4 to form
via a direct ring-opening reaction. In this
reaction pathway, the α-hydrogen of the C1–S7 group moves
from C2 to S7. Associated with this migration, the C1–S7 bond
is broken to yield intermediate 8-IM4. Direct deprotonation
of 8-IM4 then should furnish the final product 8-P as well. Nevertheless, this one-step ring-opening pathway
is kinetically disfavored due to the much greater energy barrier it
has to overcome in comparison to the other stepwise reaction pathway.
The ΔG‡ from 8-IM2 to 8-TS3 is calculated to be 55.7 kcal/mol by M06-2X,
55.1 kcal/mol by ωB97XD, and 46.9 kcal/mol by B3LYP. It is also
worth highlighting that through the one-step ring-opening pathway,
the stereocenter C4 in product 8-P has the opposite configuration
to that resulting from the other pathway; in other words, the two
reaction pathways feature opposite stereospecificity. Overall, our
DFT calculations show that compound 8 upon protonation
favors a sequence of domino processes, which begin with a one-step
[3 + 2] cycloaddition and is followed by a [1,2]-sigmatropic rearrangement
and ring-opening reactions, to give 8-P as the final
product. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG°) for the overall reaction under standard conditions
(298.5 K, 1 bar) are listed in Scheme 4B, which indicate that the transformation from 8 to 8-P is indeed thermodynamically downhill.

Intramolecular Allene–Dithiolium
Cycloaddition and Subsequent
Mechanistic Steps
Similar to alkene 8, allenyl
compound 9 can also be readily protonated, yielding cationic
intermediate 9-IM1, as shown in Scheme 5. Subsequent to this step, the allenyl group
would interact directly with the adjacent dithiolium cation to form
a [3 + 2] cycloaddition transition state 9-TS1. DFT calculations
show that this intramolecular cycloaddition takes place in a one-step
manner via bond connections through contact of C1–C2 and C3–C5,
as revealed by the optimized geometry of 9-TS1 (see Figure 6). Similar to the
afore-discussed alkene–dithiolium reaction, the allene–dithiolium
cycloaddition can also proceed through two enantiomeric transition
states of equal energy without any particular stereoselectivity. For
simplicity, however, only the reaction pathways following the (R,R) enantiomer of 9-TS1 are
depicted in Scheme 5 and discussed henceforth.

Figure 6 Optimized geometries (M06-2X/6-31G(d)) of the
intermediates and
transition states involved in the intramolecular cycloaddition of 9-IM1. Selected bond distances (in angstrom) are highlighted.

Scheme 5 (A) Mechanistic Steps from 9 to 9-P; (B)
Overall Reaction from 9 to 9-P
In the structure of 9-TS1, the C1–C2 bond distance
calculated by M06-2X/6-31G(d) is 1.820 Å, which is greatly shorter
than that of the C3–C5 bond at 2.819 Å. Like its alkene
counterpart, the optimized geometries of 9-TS1 by M06-2X
and ωB97XD functionals are fairly consistent with one another.
The B3LYP method, because of its lack of dispersion corrections, however,
predicts a slightly more asynchronous feature for 9-TS1, that is, a shorter bond at C1–C2 (1.800 Å) and longer
for C3–C5 (3.005 Å). Comparing the two cycloaddition transition
states of dithiolium with alkene and allene (i.e., 9-TS1 versus 8-TS1) calculated at the same level of theory
(e.g., M06-2X/6-31G(d)), one can clearly see the shortening of the
bond at C1–C2 in the allene (1.820 Å) versus that in the
alkene (1.892 Å) and the elongation of C3–C5 in the allene
(2.819 Å) relative to that of the alkene counterpart (2.571 Å).
The geometric variations could suggest that 8-TS1 is
more synchronous in nature than 9-TS1. QTAIM analysis
on 9-TS1 reveals two BCPs, highlighted as CP1 (ρ(r) = 0.1268, ∇2ρ(r) = −0.9616) and CP2 (ρ(r) = 0.1724,
∇2ρ(r) = 0.4103) in Figure 7C, located between
C1–C2 and C3–C5, respectively. Once again, the topological
analysis of electron density indicates that the intramolecular reaction
of allene and dithiolium is a one-step, asynchronous [3 + 2] cycloaddition
process.

(C) Molecular graph of transition state 9-TS1 calculated
by the QTAIM method. (D) NPA charges of different segments in 9-TS1 calculated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level.

NBO analysis was used to determine the role of
C4 in assisting
the formation of 9-TS1, as the bond distance of C3–C4
(2.938 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d)) is only slightly longer than that
of C1–C2 (2.819 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d)). Figure 7A shows the interactions between
the π bond of C4–C5 (donor) and the empty p orbital of
C3 (acceptor), which provides 28.74 kcal/mol of stabilization energy
to 9-TS1 as calculated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of
theory. Overlap of the allenyl group with the electron-withdrawing
dithiolium ring causes the electron density at the allene to be greatly
depleted as well. Figure 7D gives the NPA charges calculated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d)
level of theory. It can be seen that the allenyl group as a whole
possesses a total NPA charge of +0.349, which is significantly greater
than that of its precursor 9-IM1 at +0.035. To compensate,
the NPA charge of the dithiolium ring is greatly reduced from +0.847
(9-IM1) to +0.442 (9-TS1).

The Gibbs
free energy profile for the steps in the reaction mechanism
of the intramolecular allene–dithiolium cycloaddition is shown
in Figure 8. For consistency,
the energy calculations were carried out using the same computational
methodology as used in our study of the alkene–dithiolium reaction.
The structures of transition states and intermediates were first optimized
using the M06-2X, B3LYP, and ωB97XD functionals, respectively,
with the 6-31G(d) basis set. Following each geometry optimization,
a single-point calculation was performed on the obtained molecular
geometry using the same density functional but a larger basis set,
6-311+G(2d,p).

The ΔG‡ values for overcoming
the first transition state 9-TS1 are calculated to be
31.4, 28.5, and 24.1 kcal/mol by the B3LYP, M06-2X, and ωB97XD
methods, respectively. The variation in energies calculated using
the different functionals is much greater than that observed for the
alkene study, likely because the dispersion effects are more significant
in the allene structure, which in turn causes methods such as M06-2X
and ωB97XD to predict lower activation barriers. The intramolecular
cycloaddition leads to the formation a new five-membered ring (C1–C2–C3–C5–S6)
in the next intermediate 9-IM2. It is noted that in 9-IM2 the C4–S7 bond (1.639 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d))
is much shorter than that of C5–S6 (1.820 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d)),
indicating the presence of C=S double bond character at C4–S7,
consistent with the canonical structure drawn in Scheme 5. Intermediate 9-IM2 can then undergo rearrangement via the cagelike transition state 9-TS2, whose structure contains identical C3–C4/C3–C5
bond lengths as well as identical C4–S7/C5–S6 lengths.
The calculated ΔG‡ values
for this step are consistent using the M06-2X and ωB97XD functionals,
which are 10.58 and 10.22 kcal/mol, respectively. The B3LYP functional
predicts a higher activation energy of 13.71 kcal/mol for this step.
In transition state 9-TS2, a 1,2-σ bond shift occurs,
which migrates the C3–C5 bond to C3–C4 and results in
intermediate 9-IM3. Now, opposite to that of 9-IM2, the C=S double bond character is seen in the C5–S6
bond in 9-IM3, which shows a bond length of 1.634 Å
(M06-2X/6-31G(d)). In the meantime, the C4–S7 bond in 9-IM3 is significantly elongated (1.840 Å, M06-2X/6-31G(d))
compared with that in 9-IM2. Intermediate 9-IM3 is now poised to undergo a ring-opening step by breaking the C1–S6
bond. The activation energy of this step is very low with 6.90 kcal/mol
calculated by the M06-2X method, 6.53 kcal/mol by ωB97XD, and
2.70 kcal/mol by B3LYP. The low ΔG‡ of 9-TS4 can be attributed to the hyperconjugation
effect by the C2–H9 bond. NBO analysis (see Figure 9) shows that the interactions between the σ(C2–H9)
orbital and the antibonding orbital of π(C1–S7) afford
17.20 kcal/mol of stabilization energy to 9-TS4. The
other major donor–acceptor orbital interaction is the lone
pair orbital of S6 and the antibonding π(C1–S7), which
contributes 25.25 kcal/mol of stabilization energy according to the
NBO analysis. It can be seen that hyperconjugation between the adjacent
C–H bonds, in conjunction with the sulfur lone pair effects,
facilitates the bond cleavage at C1–S6 and renders it an anti-type
stereospecificity. The resulting intermediate 9-IM5 can
undergo a further straightforward deprotonation step to yield the
final product 9-P. Unlike the case of alkene–dithiolium
cycloaddition, intermediate 9-IM5 appears to be thermodynamically
more stable than the starting cation 9-IM1. Herein, the
energetic cost for losing aromaticity in the dithiolium ring of 9-IM1 is offset by the energy released from the destruction
of the allenyl unit in the process.

at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level, and orbitals are plotted with the isovalue
of 0.06.

Aside from the rearrangement step
facilitated by 9-TS2, another transition state 9-TS3 was also found allowing 9-IM2 to access
a direct ring-opening pathway without the
need for rearrangement. Nevertheless, this reaction pathway is kinetically
disfavored due to its considerably high Gibbs free energy of activation
barrier (52.15 kcal/mol, M06-2X; 48.95 kcal/mol, ωB97XD; 43.59
kcal/mol, B3LYP).

Solvent Effects on the Intramolecular Alkene/Allene
Cycloaddition
Reactions
The effects of organic solvents on the intramolecular
dithiolium–alkene/allene cycloadditions were examined by DFT
calculations using the universal implicit solvent model (SMD) proposed
by Truhlar and co-workers.47 Herein, six
typical organic solvents, namely, benzene, methylene chloride, chloroform,
acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), and
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were chosen for this study. These solvents
represent a range of organic solvents from nonpolar to highly polar
and were expected to have different solvation/stabilizing effects
on the cationic intermediates involved the reaction mechanisms. In
the calculations, each of the molecular geometries optimized in the
gas phase using the 6-31G(d) basis set in conjunction with B3LYP,
M06-2X, and ωB97XD functionals, respectively, was subjected
to single-point frequency calculations using the same density functional
but a larger basis set, 6-311+G(2d,p), to acquire more accurately
calculated thermodynamic energies. Note that the three density functionals
(B3LYP, M06-2X, and ωB97XD) have been known to be suitable for
the SMD model in terms of solvation energy calculations. For instance,
in a recent report by Acevedo and co-workers, M06-2X demonstrated
very good performance in accurately predicting solvation energy calculations
using the continuum models (PCM, CPCM, and SMD).200 Through these computational analyses, the ΔG‡ values for the first intramolecular
[3 + 2] cycloaddition step, which is the rate-limiting step of the
overall reaction, were obtained and compared in Table 1.

DMSO	29.258	29.893	33.191	29.399	25.235	32.725	
As can be seen in Table 1, the activation barriers for the intramolecular
[3 + 2] cycloadditions
of dithiolium–alkene/allene are decreased in various organic
solvents as compared with those in the gas phase. There is a general
trend of decreasing activation ΔG‡ with increasing solvent polarity; however, the degree of solvent
effects on ΔG‡ is not very
significant. As discussed above, both 8-IM1 and 9-IM1 have greater dipole moments than those of their cycloaddition
transition states 8-TS1 and 9-TS-1, respectively.
According to general solvation principles,48 polar solvents should exert a greater stabilizing effect on intermediates 8-IM1 and 9-IM1 than on the respective less polar
transition states. If this were the case, the activation ΔG‡ would show a slightly increasing trend
with increasing solvent polarity. Such a prediction obviously contradicts
the results calculated by the SMD model, suggesting that polar solvents
do stabilize the transition states better than the dithiolium intermediates
because of some other reasons. The exact origins of the solvent effects
are not yet clarified, but they can be possibly tied to the shape
and conformational differences between the intermediates and transition
states. From Table 1, it can be seen that the solvent effects on ΔG‡ are more significant in the dithiolium–alkene
cycloaddition than in the dithiolium–allene reaction, which
somehow alludes to the above shape-/conformation-related argument.

Conclusions
In summary, we have performed a comprehensive
computational analysis
based on DFT calculations to provide detailed insight into the reaction
mechanisms of intramolecular dithiolium–alkene/allene cycloadditions
and subsequent steps. Our results have shown that both alkene and
allene groups are reactive toward an adjacent dithiolium ring undergoing
a one-step asynchronous [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. Once the cycloaddition
is accomplished, rearrangement via a 1,2-σ bond shift is followed
by ring-opening reaction processes, eventually producing thermodynamically
favorable products with a tricyclic dihydroindenothiophene motif.
In these reactions, the one-step [3 + 2] cycloaddition is the rate-limiting
step, where the activation energies for alkene and allene reactions
are similar. Polar organic solvents can facilitate this cycloaddition
step but not to a very large degree, according to calculations based
on the SMD solvation model. The computational studies reported herein,
in combination with our previous papers,37,38 have systematically unraveled the reactivities of 1,3-dithiolium
toward various 1,3-dipolarophiles (alkynes, alkenes, and allenes).
It is believed that such knowledge would be of valuable guidance to
synthetic and materials organic chemistry where dithiole and dithiolium
functional groups are involved.

Computational Details and
Methodologies
Geometries of the stationary points (energy
minima and transition
states) involved in the reaction pathways were searched and optimized
at the B3LYP,49−52 M06-2X,53,54 and ωB97XD55 levels of theory using the 6-31G(d) basis set. After optimization,
each structure was further subjected to vibrational analysis at the
same level of theory to confirm it is an energy minimum (zero imaginary
frequency) or a transition state (one imaginary frequency). The connection
of each transition state (TS) to its reactant and product sides was
confirmed by Fukui’s intrinsic reaction coordinate approach.56 To evaluate the effects of density functionals
and basis sets on geometry optimization, three selected structures
(8-TS1, 8-IM2, and 8-TS2) were
also optimized by the B3LYP, M06-2X, and ωB97XD functionals
using a larger basis set 6-31++G(d,p) with diffuse and polarization
functions included. Atomic charges were calculated by the natural
population analysis (NAP) method proposed by Reed and co-workers.57 Natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was performed
using the method proposed by Weinhold.58−60 Solvent effects were
analyzed using the continuum solvation model based on the charge density
(SMD) developed by Truhlar and co-workers.47 All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package,61 and visualization of molecular structures and
molecular orbitals was carried out by CYLview62 and GaussView 5, respectively.63 Topological
analysis of electron density and visualization were conducted using
the Multiwfn program64 in combination with
the VMD software package.65
