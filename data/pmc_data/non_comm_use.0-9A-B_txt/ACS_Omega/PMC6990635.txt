Zn(OTf)2 (OTf– = trifluoromethanesulfonate)
catalyzes the silylation of pyridine, 3-picoline, and quinoline to
afford the silylated products, where the silyl groups are meta to the nitrogen. The isolated yields of the products
range from 41 to 26%. The 2- and 4-picolines yielded the silylmethylpyridines,
where the CH3 groups were silylated instead of the ring.
The pyridine silylation can occur via two separate pathways, involving
either a 1,4- or a 1,2-hydrosilylation of pyridine as the first step.
A byproduct of the pyridine silylation is a head-to-tail dimerization
of N-silyl-1,4-dihydropyridine to form a diazaditwistane
molecule.

Introduction
Recently, there has
been tremendous interest in transforming C–H
bonds into C–Si bonds,1 since the
resulting silylated compounds provide a versatile set of molecules
that can be used in various cross-coupling reactions.2 An interesting subset of this transformation is the silylation
of N-heteroarenes, such as pyridine,3 picolines,4 quinolines,5 and indoles,6 where
a C–H bond has been replaced with a C–Si bond.7 These transformations have involved transition
metals4,6a and the rather unusual KOtBu6g,6i as catalysts. In addition, main group electrophilic
Lewis acids, such as B(C6F5)3, can
activate the silane to afford a silylated N-heteroarene.3a,5a Recently, Tsuchimoto and co-workers have reported the use of zinc
salts as effective Lewis acid silylation catalysts for indoles.6j Herein, we report a series of easy-to-perform
dehydrogenative silylation reactions that utilize commercially available
zinc triflate as the catalyst. The silylation substrates are pyridine,
picolines, and quinoline.

Results and Discussion
Reaction of Et3SiH with Pyridine and 3-Picoline
The reaction of pyridine
with Et3SiH in the presence
of 16 mol % Zn(OTf)2 (Table 1, entry 1) gave two products, 3-(triethylsilylpyridine)
(1) and the disubstituted, 3,5-bis(triethylsilyl)pyridine,
(2) in a 9:1 ratio of 1:2.
In this reaction, Et3SiH is the limiting reactant with
the pyridine in a 3-fold excess. The ratio of the two products can
be changed to a 1.5:1 ratio, still in favor of 1 over 2 by making pyridine the limiting reactant (0.4 equiv relative
to Et3SiH) and using 3,5-lutidine as the solvent. However,
we were unsuccessful in fully converting 1 into 2 or having 2 be the main product of the reaction.
The reaction of 3-picoline with Et3SiH (Table 1, entry 2) gave 3-methyl-5-(triethylsilyl)pyridine
(3), where the Et3Si group is on the pyridine
ring.

Table 1 Product Yields of Silylation Reactions
with Zn(OTf)2
Reaction of 2- and 4-Picolines with Et3SiH
The reaction of 4-picoline with Et3SiH gave 4-(triethylsilylmethyl)pyridine
(4) (Table 1, entry 3) as the main product, while the reaction of 2-picoline
with Et3SiH yielded 2-(triethylsilylmethyl)pyridine (5) (Table 1, entry 4). In both instances, the silylation occurred on the methyl
group, instead of on the pyridine ring. These results are similar
to what Fukumoto and co-workers have reported in their silylation
of 2- and 4-picolines with Ir4(CO)12.4 The silylation of 4-ethylpyridine occurs at the
benzylic position as well, to afford 4-(1-triethylsilylethyl)pyridine
(14%, NMR-based yield).8

Attempts To
Increase the Yield of 1
A 1H NMR
spectrum (C6D6 or CDCl3 solvent)
of the reaction headspace gas showed the presence of free
H2.9 We did not attempt to quantify
the amount of H2 produced in the reaction. We considered
the possibility that the generated H2 was inhibiting the
reaction and thus resulting in a diminished yield. The addition of
hydrogen acceptors (cyclohexene and norbornene) did not substantially
increase the yield of the products, which is in contrast to the work
of Fukumoto and co-workers, where the addition of norbornene had a
substantial impact on their reaction yields.4 We did not detect any hydrogenated products (cyclohexane or norbornane)
in the reaction mixtures as well. While Beller and co-workers do note
that Zn(OTf)2 can function as a catalyst in the hydrogenation
of imines using H2, they do note that Zn(OTf)2 does not hydrogenate olefins.10

Also, the use of a more soluble form of Zn, Zn(NTf2)2, did not increase the yield of the reaction.

These
results are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 Use of Hydrogen Acceptors or a Different
Zinc Salt in the Pyridine Silylation Reaction
zinc salt	additive	NMR-based
% yield of 1	
Zn(OTf)2	none	50%	
Zn(OTf)2	norbornene	55%	
Zn(OTf)2	cyclohexene	51%	
Zn(NTf2)2	none	33%	
We also tried cooling the reaction after 2 h, venting
and purging
with N2 and then reheating for an additional 2 h, to determine
if physically removing the free H2 would increase the yield
of the reaction. There was no noticeable effect on the yield of the
reaction.

The use of another silane, Me2PhSiH, did
not increase
the reaction yield. We obtained the same yield (50%, based on NMR
spectroscopy) of 3-(dimethylphenylsilyl)pyridine when using the same
reaction conditions with pyridine, Zn(OTf)2, and Me2PhSiH.

Three to four turnovers are the typical range
for the Zn(OTf)2 catalyst. The 1H NMR spectrum
of the crude reaction
mixture (Supporting Information, Figure S1) shows ∼20% of the free silane remaining in solution, yet
running the reaction for longer periods of time (6 vs 2 h) did not
increase the yield. One possibility that we did consider was that
the catalyst was becoming inactive after a certain time period. However,
recycling the Zn(OTf)2 from a previous reaction showed
that the recycled Zn(OTf)2 was about 80% as effective as
the fresh or unrecycled Zn(OTf)2. Therefore, we are at
a loss as to why the combined amounts of 1 and 2 only reflect a 61% (NMR-based yield) incorporation of Si
from Et3SiH. Given the high reaction temperatures, we were
concerned that trace impurities in the Zn(OTf)2 were responsible
for the actual catalysis. We did the same reaction (pyridine, Zn(OTf)2, Et3SiH, 240 °C, 2 h) using three different
manufacturers of Zn(OTf)2 (TCI America, Acros, and Alfa
Aesar), and the yields were within 2% of each other. While these reactions
do not definitively rule out trace impurities as being the actual
catalysts, it does bolster the argument that Zn(OTf)2 is
the actual catalyst. A control reaction of just pyridine and Et3SiH at 240 °C for 2 h did not yield any product. Despite
the high reaction temperature, a 1H NMR spectrum of the
crude reaction mixture is fairly clean, with not a great deal of identifiable
side products (Supporting Information Figure S1).

Proposed Mechanism for Pyridine Silylation To Form 1 and 2
We believe that the mechanism of the
pyridine silylation follows the same mechanism proposed by Oestreich
and co-workers in their silylation reaction of substituted pyridines
with a ruthenium complex (Scheme 1).3b The Zn2+ center interacts with a silane to form a pyridinium silyl cation
(6)11 and a zinc hydride species
(step a). We have been unable to detect either species by NMR spectroscopy,
but both intermediates have been proposed as intermediates by Tsuchimoto
co-workers in their silylation of indoles with Zn(OTf)2.6j We do observe a broad resonance (δ
5.30) in the 1H NMR spectrum when Zn(OTf)2,
pyridine-d5, and Et3SiH are
mixed together at room temperature (rt). This broad resonance has
also been observed by Tsuchimoto and co-workers in their work with
Zn(OTf)2 and silanes.12 However,
we have been unable to isolate and fully characterize the compound
that gives rise to this broad feature. Tsuchimoto and co-workers propose
a Zn2+ and Et3SiH interaction to account for
this observation. The Si+ species in the proposed mechanism
could be in the form of 6 or as a [Zn–H–SiEt3]2+ species, while the H– could
be in the form of a [(py)nZn–H]+ (py = pyridine) cation (monomeric or dimeric) in our proposed
mechanism.13 Delocalization of the positive
charge to the C4 position in 6 followed by a H– addition would lead to N-silyl-1,4-dihydropyridine
(7) (step b).11,14 An electrophilic attack
by a Si+ species to 7, to form a 1,3-bis(triethylsilyl)-3,4-dihydropyridinium
cation, followed by loss of H2 would form the 1,3-bis(silyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine
(8) intermediate (steps c and d).3b8 can then undergo a retrohydrosilylation14 to form 1 (step e) or undergo another
electrophilic Si+ attack and loss of H2 to form
1,3,5-tris(silyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine (9) (step f). A
retrohydrosilylation of 9 would then lead to the formation
of 2 (step g).

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for Pyridine Silylation
We performed some computational studies to determine
the feasibility
of the Zn2+ center forming a Zn–H species since
we had very little data on the proposed step (a), Scheme 1. It is reasonable to assume
that the Zn2+ would be surrounded by four pyridine molecules,
given that pyridine is both the substrate and solvent and that the
triflate anion would be just a counterion and not coordinated to the
Zn2+ center. The loss of pyridine and coordination/interaction
with a Et3SiH molecule was calculated to be +20.3 kcal/mol
(Figure 1). The overall
formation of 6 and [(py)3ZnH]+ was
predicted to be exergonic by 36.2 kcal/mol from [Zn(py)4]2+ and Et3SiH. These results suggest that
the proposed step (a) in Scheme 1 is thermodynamically possible.

Figure 1 Energy profile for the
formation of 6 calculated at
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Relative free energies in the gas phase
and enthalpies in the gas phase (in brackets) in kcal/mol are shown.

We were also interested in trying to determine
if 6 was electrophilic enough to function as a Si+ source
in step (c), Scheme 1, to form the proposed 1,3-bis(silyl)-3,4-dihydropyridinium cation
intermediate, the precursor to 8. By considering the
high-pressure conditions (240 °C, 11 atm) used in the experiment,
the entropy contribution should be small enough so that enthalpy might
be a better representation of the energies in this reaction. The relative
energies are shown in Figure 2, with an enthalpy difference of 27.8 kcal/mol between 6, 7, and a possible transition state, TS7,6. The ΔH between the proposed 1,3-bis(silyl)-3,4-dihydropyridinium
cation, pyridine and 6, 7 was determined
to be endothermic by 5.4 kcal/mol. While the 27.8 kcal/mol represents
a substantial energy barrier, it is readily accessible given the high
reaction temperature of 240 °C. This does suggest that 6 can function as the Si+ source in the formation
of 8 (Scheme 1, steps c and d).

Figure 2 Energy profile for the reaction between 6 and 7 at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level. Relative
enthalpies in
the gas phase in kcal/mol are shown.

Running the reaction (Zn(OTf)2, pyridine, Et3SiH) at a lower temperature, 180 °C, 2 h, allowed us to observe
several of the proposed intermediates in the reaction (Figure 3). We have good spectral evidence
for intermediates 7 (Figure 3) and 8 (Supporting Information, Figures S13–S16) and tentative evidence
for 9 (Supporting Information, Figure S17).

Figure 3 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture of
py, Et3SiH, Zn(OTf)2 at 180 °C, 2 h, in
C6D6.

Reaction of Zn(OTf)2 and Et3SiH with Pyridine-d5
The reaction of pyridine-d5, Et3SiH, and Zn(OTf)2 at 180 °C, 10 min, afforded the expected deuterated 7 with a H at the C4 position, consistent with the proposed mechanism
(Figure 4a). The gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the reaction
mixture showed the silylated pyridine product, 1, with
two masses consistent with 1-d4 (m/z 197) and 1-d3 (m/z 196).
However, the 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture (Figure 4a) had a hydrogen
resonance (δ 8.59) at the C6 position of 1 and
not at the expected C4 position (δ 7.41) (Figure 4b shows the NMR spectrum of the pyridine-h5 reaction). The expected resonance for a hydrogen
at C4 in 1-d3 was observed
only in a trace amount in the 1H NMR spectrum. At longer
reaction times (2 h, 180 °C), we do observe the hydrogen at C4
in 1-d3, but we were puzzled
by the lack of a signal at short reaction times. In addition, there
was a hydrogen resonance at δ 3.7 that we initially could not
identify, indicated by a question mark in Figure 4a.

nondeuterated pyridine

internal standard.

To account for these
observations, we took a closer look at the
unassigned resonances in the mid-field region of the NMR spectrum
(Figure 4b). By varying
the reaction times at 180 °C and performing a series of microdistillations
on the reaction mixtures, we have been able to identify and assign
all of the resonances for two new intermediates, 1-(triethylsilyl)-1,2-dihydropyridine
(10) (Supporting Information, Figures S18–S21) and 1,5-bis(triethylsilyl)-1,2-dihydropyridine
(11) (Supporting Information, Figures S22–S25) (Scheme 2). Cook and Lyons have reported the trimethylsilyl analogs
of 10 and 11, and our NMR spectral data
closely matches their reported data.1510 is the result of a 1,2-addition of Et3SiH instead
of a 1,4-addition (Scheme 2, step a).3a The addition of a
Si+ group followed by loss of H2 would result
in the formation of 11 (Scheme 2, step b). Loss of Et3SiH via
a 1,2-retrohydrosilylation would result in a hydrogen at the C6 position
of 1, which was initially the 2-position in 10. This would be consistent with the observed placement of the hydrogen
in the pyridine-d5 reaction at the C6
position of 1-d3 (Figure 4a).

Scheme 2 Alternative
Pathway for Pyridine Silylation, via an Initial 1,2-Addition
Step
Therefore, the silylation of
pyridine to form 1 can
occur via two different pathways, either a 1,2- or a 1,4-hydrosilylation
addition as the initial steps.

We were also interested in computationally
determining the relative
stability of 7 and 10 to try to gain some
more insight into the two possible pathways, the 1,4-hydrosilylation
(Scheme 1, steps (a
and b)) vs the 1,2-hydrosilylation (Scheme 2, step (a)). Compound 7 was
calculated to be slightly more stable than 10 by 3.1
kcal/mol (Figure 5).
Therefore, in the initial hydrosilylation additions to form the dihydropyridine
intermediates, there is not a large thermodynamic difference between
one pathway over the other.

in the gas phase and enthalpies in the gas phase [in brackets] in
kcal/mol are shown.

Identification of an Unknown
Organic Side Product
During
the analysis of the organic products of the pyridine, Et3SiH, Zn(OTf)2 at 180 °C reaction, we also observed
numerous small peaks in the 1–3 ppm region of the 1H NMR spectrum. We had previously observed these peaks (Supporting
Information, Figure S28) in the reaction
of [cis-{(η5-C5H3)2(CMe2)2}Ru2κ2-(Me4Phen)2(CH3CN)2][OTf]2 (12) (Me4Phen = 3,4,7,8-tetramethylphenanthroline) with pyridine and Et3SiH at 180 °C (eq 1). We believe that the reaction of pyridine with Et3SiH to form 1 using 12 as a catalyst follows
the same reaction mechanism as proposed in Scheme 1, since we also observe intermediates 7 and 8 in the crude reaction mixture when 12 is used as the catalyst 1  The GC/MS spectrum of the unidentified organic
had a very small parent ion peak of 392 u, but the main peak had a
mass of 196 u. This suggested a partially hydrogenated pyridine that
had dimerized and contained two Et3Si groups and that the
dimer was easily fragmented in the mass spectrometer. We had a difficult
time determining the connectivity of the unknown molecule using various
NMR spectroscopic techniques. The compound was also an oil and not
amenable to crystallization at room temperature. We were inspired
by the work of Chang and co-workers, where they sulfonated various
silyl groups on partially hydrogenated N-silylpyridines
to produce solids that could then be crystallized.3a The reaction of 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride with the
unidentified organic provided a more stable compound that could then
be crystallized (eq 2). Through a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study, we were able
to establish the connectivity of the mystery molecule 2  While the quality of the X-ray structure
(Supporting Information, Table S1) does
not allow for accurate bond lengths, we were able to determine the
salient features of the molecule. The core of the molecule has a ditwistane
configuration,16 and when the nitrogens
are taken into consideration, it would be considered a diazaditwistane
molecule (13).17 The sulfonation
reaction only replaced one of the Et3Si groups to provide
the monosulfonated version of a diazaditwistane derivative (14).

The structure of 13 is shown, where
the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core of a ditwistane molecule is in bold
and the two diagonal ethano linkers are shown as dashed bonds (Chart 1a). The two individual
dihydropyridine rings are shown in different colors, and the three
newly formed bonds from the dimerization are shown in bold (Chart 1b).

Chart 1 Diazaditwistane Core
(a) and 1,4-Dihydropyridines Dimerized (b)
With the structure in hand, a literature search gave us a remarkably
similar molecule reported by Marazano and co-workers, where they report
the dimerization of 1-(phenylmethyl)-3-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine
under acidic conditions (structure (a), eq 3).18 The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane
core is highlighted in bold in structure (b), with the two diagonal
ethano bridges as dashed lines. Structure (c) highlights the two different
1,4-dihydropyridine rings that have dimerized, while the bold lines
show the new bonds that are formed in. The R and Me groups have been
omitted for clarity in structures (b) and (c) (eq 3) 3  They propose an initial protonation to form
a dihydropyridinium cation, which then cyclizes with another 1,4-dihydropyridine.
Given the prevalence of 7 in our reaction mixture (with
either Zn(OTf)2 or 12 as a catalyst), we propose
that 13 forms via the same reaction mechanism as proposed
by Marazano and co-workers. We believe that it is the initial protonation
(bottom 1,4-dihydropyridine, Scheme 3) that sets off the “cascade” of reactions
for the cyclization, where the positive charge is always ortho to a nitrogen. We are not sure whether the reactions are stepwise
or concerted but show the reactions in a stepwise fashion for clarity
purposes.

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of 13
Ammon and Jensen have also
reported the dimerization of 1-methyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide
to form a similar structure under acidic conditions but they do not
propose a mechanism for the product formation.19

The H+ source could be a dihydrogen complex20 when 12 is used as the catalyst
or the heterolytic cleavage of a H2 molecule by the Zn2+ cation when Zn(OTf)2 is used as the catalyst.21 NMR spectral analysis of the crude reaction
mixture (py, Et3SiH, 12 (1 mol %), 180 °C,
16 h) shows that ∼14% of the silicon from Et3SiH
went into making 13. Although we only isolated 14 in 2% from the reaction (pyridine, Et3SiH, 12 (1 mol %), 130 °C, 16 h) and is therefore a minor
side product, we thought it was still insightful in providing further
evidence for the role and presence of 7 in the silylation
of pyridine.

Silylation of the Pyridine Ring vs the CH3 Group
in Picolines
A closer look at the possible mechanism for
the silylation reaction helps explain the difference in the silicon
placement, ring vs CH3 group. The common starting point
is the reaction of the Si+ species with either pyridine
or picoline to form the 1-(triethylsilyl)pyridinium 6 or 1-(triethylsilyl)picolinium cation. The reactivity differs as
to whether a hydride adds to the 4-position (the left side of Scheme 4) or abstracts a
H+ from one of the benzylic hydrogens (the right side of Scheme 4). The mechanism
on the right mirrors the same proposed mechanism by Fukomoto and co-workers.4 When the CH3 group is either at the
2- or 4-position, the CH3 can undergo deprotonation by
a hydride at the CH3 position to form the corresponding
methylidene compounds and H2 (the right side of Scheme 4). The addition of
Si+ to the methylidene C, following by the loss of Si+ (4-picoline substrate) or a 1,3-silylshift (2-picoline substrate),
would then result in the silylmethylpyridine products, 4 and 5. However, we were unable to observe any of the
proposed methylidene intermediates when the reaction was carried out
at 180 °C, and therefore the proposed methylidene intermediates
are still slightly speculative.

Scheme 4 Different Pathway for 4 and 5 Formations
When pyridine or 3-picoline are the substrates, the addition of
H– to the 4-position of the silylpyridinium cation
would afford intermediate 7 instead, which would then
lead to the eventual formation of 1 or 3 (the left side of Scheme 4).

Silylation of Quinoline
Quinoline
is one of the more
challenging substrates to silylate given its propensity to be hydrogenated
to tetra and dihydroquinolines.5a Murai
and co-workers have previously reported the silylation of quinoline
at the 8-position using an iridium complex,5b while Ito and co-workers have reported the silylation of quinoline
at the 2-position using a boron-based reagent under basic conditions.22 The reaction of quinoline, Et3SiH
with Zn(OTf)2 at 180 °C, 1 h afforded 3-triethylsilylquinoline
(15) in a 26% yield (eq 4). The 1H NMR spectrum also showed the presence
of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (37% NMR-based yield) 4  We had initially performed the reaction in
a closed microwave tube, where the NMR-based yield of 15 was 27%. We thought that performing the reaction in an open system,
under 1 atm of nitrogen, would increase the yield by allowing any
free H2 to escape, thereby decreasing the amount of tetrahydroquinoline
produced. While performing the reaction in an open system did increase
the yield by ∼7%, it also increased the amount of tetrahydroquinoline
by about the same amount! Therefore, the ratio of 15:
tetrahydroquinoline was about the same, 1:1.2, regardless of whether
the system was open or closed. We do not understand the reason for
the increase in yield when an open system is used. We do not observe
any remaining Et3SiH in the 1H NMR spectrum
of the crude reaction mixture after 1 h. Therefore, longer reaction
times (2 vs 1 h) did not affect the yield of the reaction. We believe
the reason for the formation of the tetrahydroquinoline is that a
1,2-hydrosilylation of the quinoline would not afford 15, unlike the case of pyridine and Et3SiH (Scheme 2). The 1,4-hydrosilylation23 pathway would lead to the formation of 15. These two competing pathways are shown in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Alternative Pathways
for Quinoline Silylation
Nikonov and co-workers have also observed both the 1,2- and 1,4-hydrosilylations
of quinoline with their [CpRu(iPr3P)(NCMe)2]+ catalyst using Me2PhSiH as the silane.24 We have tentative 1H NMR spectral
evidence for the formation of N-triethylsilyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline,
when the NMR sample of the crude reaction mixture is made up under
inert conditions. The observed resonances closely match those of N-trimethylsilyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline.25 The N-silyltetrahydroquinoline
product is rapidly hydrolyzed upon exposure to air to form 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline.
Chang and co-workers have also seen similar reactivity in the conversion
of their N-silylated species to the N–H products
upon silica gel chromatography.5a

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the dehydrogenative silylation of
pyridine, picolines, and quinoline using Zn(OTf)2, a readily
available reagent. We believe that the observed intermediates for
the pyridine silylation are consistent with an electrophilic aromatic
substitution (SEAr)-type mechanism, with the Zn2+ center activating the silane. While the yields are moderate (42%)
to very modest (26%), we believe that these reactions are still noteworthy,
due to the ease and simplicity in transforming pyridine, picolines,
and quinoline to various silylated products with Zn(OTf)2.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
Reactions that
required inert conditions
were performed using modified Schlenk techniques or in an MBraun Unilab
glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 400 MHz spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are given relative
to the residual proton or 13C solvent resonances. NMR spectra
were recorded at room temperature (20–25 °C) unless otherwise
noted. GC/MS data were collected on an Agilent 6890 Series GC connected
to a HP 5973 mass detector. Elemental analyses were performed using
a Thermo Electron Flash EA 1112 Series analyzer. Microwave heating
was conducted using a CEM Discover SP instrument in either 10 or 35
mL snap cap pressure tubes or in an open vessel mode. The temperature
of the reactions in the microwave was monitored using the floor-mounted
IR sensor in the instrument (external surface measurement).

Safety
Note
The pressures when performing the microwave
reactions at 240 °C reached 11 atm, which are within the stated
tolerances of the tubes provided by CEM. When heating the reactions
at 170–180 °C in an oil bath, Ace pressure tubes were
used. We believe that the pressure at that temperature range is ∼5
atm. All oil bath reactions were conducted behind a blast shield with
the appropriate personal protective equipment.

Solvents and Reagents
Unless otherwise indicated, all
chemicals were used as received. Common solvents and reagents were
purchased from Acros, Fisher Scientific, VWR, or TCI America. Deuterated
solvents were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. 4-Picoline,
2-picoline, 3-picoline, 3,5-lutidine, C6H6,
Et3SiH, CDCl3 and C6D6, and CD3CN were degassed and dried over 3 Å sieves.
Pyridine and quinoline were dried over CaH2 (room temperature,
overnight), vacuum-distilled, and stored over 3 Å sieves. All
glassware were heated to 120 °C before being brought into the
glovebox. 3,4,7,8-Tetramethylphenanthroline (Me4Phen) was
purchased from Acros and used as received. [cis-{(η5-C5H3)2(CMe2)2}Ru2(μ-η6,η6-C10H8)][OTf]2 was prepared as previously
described.26

Computational
All geometries of reactants, transition
states (TSs), intermediates, and products were fully optimized in
the gas phase by Gaussian 09, D01 program with B3LYP functional.27 The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was used for all atoms
in the reaction shown in Figure 1.28 The 6-311+G(d,p) basis
set was used for calculations in Figures 2 and 3.28b,29 Frequency calculations at the same level of theory were carried
out to verify all stationary points as minima (zero imaginary frequency)
and transition states (one imaginary frequency) and also to provide
free energies. The reported energies are the relative Gibbs free energies
and enthalpies with thermal corrections in kcal/mol.

Preparation
of 3-(Triethylsilyl)pyridine (1) and Bis-3,5-(triethylsilyl)pyridine
(2)
Zn(OTf)2 (99.90 mg, 0.2748 mmol,
16 mol %) was added to an oven-dried 10 mL CEM microwave pressure
tube in an inert atmospheric glovebox. Pyridine (405.1 mg, 5.128 mmol)
and Et3SiH (199.8 mg, 1.722 mmol) were added to the tube.
The tube was placed into a CEM Discover microwave and heated to 240
°C for 2 h. The resulting dark brown solution was transferred
to a 50 mL round-bottom flask using 3 × 1 mL CH2Cl2, and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. Hexane (50 mL)
was added to the semisolid oil, and the hexane solution was passed
through a SiO2-padded frit (15 mL size). Et2O (50 mL) was then used to elute the products off the SiO2-padded frit. The solution was collected, and the solvent was removed
by rotary evaporation. A 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction
mixture showed a mixture of 1 and 2 in a
9:1 ratio. 1 was purified by a vacuum microdistillation
(40 mtorr, 80 °C = flask temperature) to afford a clear liquid
(138.0 mg, ∼99% purity, 41% yield based on Et3SiH).
A preparative TLC (20 × 20 cm, 2000 μm, SiO2 plate, 10 vol % EtOAc: 90 vol % hexane) was performed on the bottom
residue from the distillation. The top band (Rf = 0.45) was collected and extracted with EtOAc (70 mL) to
afford pure 2 as a liquid (21.6 mg, 0.0704 mmol, 8%).
A previous reaction with similar amounts of reactants at the same
temperature and reaction time showed the crude reaction yields of 1 to be 168.1 mg, 0.8709 mmol, 50% and 2 to be
29.24 mg, 0.0953 mmol, 11%, determined using 1,4-dimethoxybenzene
as an internal standard in the NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR
spectral data in CDCl3 matched the previously reported
data.30 The NMR spectrum of 1 in C6D6 is reported since the spectrum shows
all four aromatic peaks with no overlapping solvent peaks. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6): δ 8.90–8.87
(m, 1H), 8.60 (dd, 3JHH = 5.1
Hz, 4JHH = 2.0 Hz, 1H), 7.40

Reaction To Favor the Formation of 2
Zn(OTf)2 (116.9 mg, 0.3216 mmol), pyridine
(106.2 mg, 1.344 mmol),
3,5-lutidine (296.2 mg), and Et3SiH (360.0 mg, 3.103 mmol)
were added to a microwave glass tube. The contents were heated in
a CEM Discover microwave at 250 °C for 2 h. 1,4-Dimethoxybenzene
(39.5 mg, 0.2862 mmol) was added to the orange solution, and the solution
was mixed thoroughly. A 1H NMR spectrum of an aliquot was
recorded in C6D6. The spectrum showed 0.4436
mmol of 1 and 0.2976 mmol of 2 based on
the added 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.

Preparation of 3-Methyl-5-(triethylsilyl)pyridine
(3)
Zn(OTf)2 (103.6 mg, 0.2850 mmol,
16 mol %)
was added to an oven-dried 10 mL CEM microwave pressure tube in an
inert atmospheric glovebox. 3-Picoline (401.8 mg, 4.320 mmol) and
Et3SiH (202.9 mg, 1.749 mmol) were added to the tube. The
tube was placed into a CEM Discover microwave and heated to 240 °C
for 2 h. The yellow solution was transferred to a 50 mL round-bottom
flask using 3 × 1 mL CH2Cl2, and the volatiles
were removed in vacuo. Hexane (50 mL) was added to the semisolid oil,
and the hexane solution was passed through a SiO2-padded
frit (15 mL size). Et2O (50 mL) was then used to elute
the products off the SiO2-padded frit. The solution was
collected, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. 3 was purified by a vacuum microdistillation (40 mtorr, 100
°C = flask temperature) to afford a clear liquid. A 1H NMR spectrum of the product showed some Et3SiOH present
in the sample. The clear liquid was placed under a vacuum for 30 min
to afford 120.3 mg. The 1H NMR spectrum showed the product
to be ∼94 mol % pure (∼96 mass% purity, assuming the
impurity is Et3SiOH, 32% yield). A previous reaction with
similar amounts of reactants at the same temperature and reaction
time showed the crude reaction yield of 3 to be 137.5
mg, 0.6645 mmol, 40%, determined using 1,4-dimethoxybenzene as an
internal standard in the NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectral
data in CDCl3 matched the previously reported data,4b with the exception of the resonance reported
at δ 7.26, which we suspect is a typographical error and should
be δ 7.55. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ
8.46 (br s, 1H), 8.41 (d, 4JHH = 2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.56–7.54 (m, 1H), 2.33 (s, 3H), 0.97 (t, 3JHH = 7.4 Hz, 9H), 0.81 (q, 3JHH = 7.8 Hz, 6H).

Preparation
of 4-(Triethylsilylmethyl)pyridine (4)
Zn(OTf)2 (101.5 mg, 0.2792 mmol, 16 mol %)
was added to an oven-dried 10 mL CEM microwave pressure tube in an
inert atmospheric glovebox. 4-Picoline (400.8 mg, 4.310 mmol) and
Et3SiH (198.6 mg, 1.712 mmol) were added to the tube. The
tube was placed into a CEM Discover microwave and heated to 240 °C
for 2 h. The vibrant green mixture was transferred to a 50 mL round-bottom
flask using 3 × 1 mL CH2Cl2, and the volatiles
were removed in vacuo. The green color quickly faded to a pale yellow
upon adding the CH2Cl2. Hexane (50 mL) was added
to the semisolid oil, and the hexane solution was passed through a
SiO2-padded frit (15 mL size). Et2O (50 mL)
was then used to elute the products off the SiO2-padded
frit. The solution was collected, and the solvent was removed by rotary
evaporation. 4 was purified by a vacuum microdistillation
(40 mtorr, 100 °C = flask temperature) to afford a clear liquid
(128.2 mg). A 1H NMR spectrum of the liquid showed two
impurities along with 4, with an approximate composition
of ∼85 mol % 4. Assuming the mol %–mass
%, the yield of 4 is ∼31%. A previous reaction
with similar amounts of reactants at the same temperature and reaction
time showed the crude reaction yield of 4 to be 163.3
mg, 0.7887 mmol, 46%, determined using 1,4-dimethoxybenzene as an
internal standard in the NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectral
data in CDCl3 matched the previously reported data.4a

Preparation of 2-(Triethylsilylmethyl)pyridine
(5)
Zn(OTf)2 (98.8 mg, 0.2718 mmol,
16 mol %) was
added to an oven-dried 10 mL CEM microwave pressure tube in an inert
atmospheric glovebox. 2-Picoline (429.9 mg, 4.623 mmol) and Et3SiH (205.0 mg, 1.767 mmol) were added to the tube. The tube
was placed into a CEM Discover microwave and heated to 240 °C
for 2 h. The dark brown solution was transferred to a 50 mL round-bottom
flask using 3 × 1 mL CH2Cl2, and the volatiles
were removed in vacuo. Hexane (50 mL) was added to the dark oil, and
the hexane solution was passed through a SiO2-padded frit
(15 mL size). Et2O (50 mL) was then used to elute the products
off the SiO2-padded frit. The solution was collected, and
the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. 4 was
purified by a vacuum microdistillation (40 mtorr, 100 °C = flask
temperature) to afford a clear liquid (114.3 mgs). The 1H NMR spectrum showed the product to be ∼97 mol % pure (∼97
mass% purity, assuming the impurity is 2-methyl-5-(triethylsilyl)pyridine),
(30% yield). A previous reaction with similar amounts of reactants
at the same temperature and reaction time showed the crude reaction
yield of 4 to be 198.6 mg, 0.9592 mmol, 55%, determined
using 1,4-dimethoxybenzene as an internal standard in the NMR spectrum.
The 1H NMR spectral data in CDCl3 matched the
previously reported data.4b

Observation
of Intermediates 7, 8,
and 9, for the Pyridine, Et3SiH, and Zn(OTf)2 Reactions at 180 °C, 2 h
Zn(OTf)2 (98.0 mg, 0.270 mmol, 16 mol %), pyridine (397.1 mg, 5..027 mmol),
and Et3SiH (196.6 mg, 1.695 mmol) were placed in an oven-dried
microwave pressure tube. The contents were heated in a CEM Discover
microwave reactor at 180 °C for 2 h. At the end of the reaction,
the reaction was light yellow. The volatiles were removed under reduced
pressure, and the crude reaction mixture was brought into the glovebox.
The organics were extracted with pentane (2 × 3 mL) and filtered
to remove the Zn(OTf)2. The yellow solution was collected,
and the pentane was removed under reduced pressure. The NMR spectrum
showed the ratio of 7:8:9 to
be 6.3:3.2:1. The spectral data for 7 matched the reported
data by Oestreich and co-workers.11 The
residual oil was then heated in a round-bottom flask at 60 °C
for 30 min under reduced pressure (40 mtorr). Most of the more volatile 7 evaporated from the flask, while 8 coated the
walls of the round-bottom flask and 9 stayed primarily
on the bottom of the flask. 9 was extracted from the
flask by carefully pipetting the C6D6 into the
flask to just dissolve the contents on the bottom. A 1H
NMR spectrum of concentrated 8 was then obtained by dissolving
the contents off the wall of the flask.

The reaction amounts and conditions
were the same for the
180 °C, 2 h reaction as described above, except that the reaction
time was only 5 min instead of 2 h. The organic intermediates were
extracted with pentane and filtered, and the more volatile 10 was collected by microdistillation (70 °C = flask temperature,
30 min, 40 mtorr), while the less volatile 11 remained

Preparation of [cis-{(η5-C5H3)2(CMe2)2}Ru2κ2-(Me4Phen)2(CH3CN)2][OTf]2 (12)
[cis-{(η5-C5H3)2(CMe2)2}Ru2(μ-η6,η6-C10H8)][OTf]2 (295.1 mg, 0.3521 mmol) was dissolved in CH3CN
(8.9856 g), and the orange solution was evenly pipetted into eight
5 mm NMR tubes. The tubes were placed on the inside of the coils of
a compact fluorescent bulb (105 W, 5000 K temperature rating, 6600
lumens) and photolyzed for 4 h. The tubes were cooled by streaming
room-temperature compressed air across the tubes during the photolysis
period. The light yellow solutions were combined into a single round-bottom
flask, and the acetonitrile was removed in vacuo. The complex was
then dissolved in CH3CN (2.0259 g) and transferred to a
10 mL microwave glass tube. Me4Phen (175.0 mg, 0.7415 mmol)
was also added to the solution, and the solution was heated to 80
°C for 20 min using a CEM microwave reactor. The resulting solution
was dark red. The solution was brought into the glovebox and added
to Et2O (50 mL). The mixture was filtered to yield an orange-red
solid. The solid was washed with more Et2O (2 × 5
mL), THF (3 × 5 mL), cold CH3CN (0.5 mL), and finally
Et2O (1 × 3 mL). The solid was dried in vacuo to afford
339.0 mg, 0.268 mmol, 76%. The NMR spectra were recorded at 80 °C
due to the hindered rotation of the two rutheniums about their piano
stool axes. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, 80 °C):

Preparation and Semipurification
of 13
Compound 12 (24.6 mg, 0.0194
mmol, 1 mol %), pyridine
(414.2 mg, 5.243 mmol), and Et3SiH (196.2 mg, 1.691 mmol)
were added to a 5 mL Ace glass pressure tube. The contents were heated
at 170 °C for 17 h in an oil bath. The dark red/purple solution
was brought back into the glovebox, transferred to a round-bottom
flask with CH2Cl2 (3 × 0. 5 mL), and the
solvents were removed under reduced pressure with heating (40 °C,
40 min). Pentane (∼5 mL) was added to the dark purple semisolid,
and the mixture was filtered using a Kim-wipe plugged pipet. The pentane
was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting red oil was
washed with acetonitrile (4 × 0.5 mL). The desired product, 13, is not soluble in acetonitrile. The remaining oil was
transferred to a sublimation flask, and the product was distilled
onto a liquid-nitrogen-cooled cold finger (105 °C flask temperature,
20 min, 40 mtorr) to afford 54.4 mg of a clear oil that contained
mostly 13.

Preparation
of 14
In a glovebox, pyridine
(640.1 mg, 8.103 mmol), Et3SiH (210.5 mg, 1.815 mmol),
and 12 (34.1 mg, 0.02695 mmol, 1.5 mol %) were added
to a valved ampule and placed in an oil bath at 130 °C for 19
h. The reaction was carried out at 130 °C instead of 180 °C
with the intent to maximize the formation of 13. The
volatiles were removed under reduced pressure to yield a dark red/purple
oil. The ampule was brought back into the glovebox, and the oil was
washed with pentane (4 × 1 mL), and the pentane solution was
filtered through a Kim-wipe plugged pipet. The pentane solution was
collected, and the pentane was removed in vacuo to yield 102.9 mg
of crude 13. Impure compound 13 was dissolved
in CH2Cl2 (404.5 mg) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine
(4.1 mg, 0.0336 mmol), Et3N (54.2 mg, 0.5366 mmol) added
to the mixture. 4-Nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (85.3 mg, 0.3842 mmol)
was then added as a solid to the mixture, and the reaction was allowed
to proceed at rt for 16 h. The reaction solution was brought out of
the N2-filled glovebox, and water (2 mL) and CH2Cl2 (1 mL) were added to the resulting red solution. The
CH2Cl2 fraction was collected, washed with water
(3 × 1 mL), dried with MgSO4, filtered, and the CH2Cl2 removed under reduced pressure, resulting in
a brown solid (123.8 mg). The solid was placed on a microfrit and
washed with cold acetonitrile (3 × 0.25 mL) to afford an off-white
powder (10.6 mg, 0.0222 mmol, 2% based on starting silane). 14 will slowly decompose in the presence of water. Although
the reaction workup was outside of the glovebox, all subsequent manipulations
of pure 14 were conducted in a N2-filled glovebox
(crystal growing setups and NMR sample preparation).

Preparation of 15
Zn(OTf)2 (222.1
mg, 0.6110 mmol, 16 mol %), quinoline (1.1459 mg, 8.882 mmol), and
Et3SiH (448.2 mg, 3.864 mmol) were placed into an oven-dried
5 mL round-bottom flask in the glovebox. The round bottom was then
placed in a CEM Discover microwave, and the reaction was heated to
180 °C for 1 h in the open vessel mode, under a N2 atmosphere. The resulting liquid quickly solidified upon cooling.
The contents of the flask were placed in a beaker, and the product
was extracted with hexanes (80 mL). The hexane solution was filtered
through a SiO2-padded frit (30 mm of SiO2, 30
mL size frit). The hexane fraction was discarded, and the SiO2 was washed with CH2Cl2 (100 mL) to
give a light yellow solution. The CH2Cl2 was
removed under reduced pressure to afford a yellow oil (734.6 mg).
The oil was microdistilled (40 mtorr). The first fraction (temperature
of the flask = 55 °C, 15 min) contained mostly tetrahydroquinoline
and quinoline. The second fraction was collected by heating the flask
to 160 °C, 25 min, 40 mtorr, to afford 15 as a liquid
(247.0 mg, ∼95 mol % pure, ∼26%). The 1H
NMR spectrum of 15 in CDCl3 matched that of
the previously reported spectral data.31

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction of 14
A crystal (0.126 × 0.097 × 0.062 mm3) was placed
onto a thin glass optical fiber and mounted on a Rigaku XtaLab Synergy-S
Dualflex diffractometer equipped with a HyPix-6000HE HPC area detector
for data collection at 99.9(5) K. A preliminary set of cell constants
and an orientation matrix were calculated from a small sampling of
reflections.32 A short pre-experiment was
run, from which an optimal data collection strategy was determined.
The full data collection was carried out using a PhotonJet (Cu) X-ray
source with frame times of 1.12 and 4.50 seconds and a detector distance
of 31.2 mm. A series of frames were collected in 0.50° steps
in ω at different 2θ, κ, and ϕ settings. After
the intensity data were corrected for absorption, the final cell constants
were calculated from the xyz centroids of 19583 strong
reflections from the actual data collection after integration.32

The structure was solved using ShelXT33 and refined using ShelXL.34 The space group P63/m was determined based on systematic absences and intensity
statistics. Most or all nonhydrogen atoms were assigned from the solution.
Full-matrix least-squares/difference Fourier cycles were performed,
which located any remaining nonhydrogen atoms. All nonhydrogen atoms
were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. All hydrogen
atoms were placed in ideal positions and refined as riding atoms with
relative isotropic displacement parameters. The final full-matrix
least-squares refinement converged to R1 = 0.1365
(F2, I > 2σ(I)) and wR2 = 0.3702 (F2, all data).

All crystals were grown
from a myriad of solvents and conditions
compatible with the material crystallized with the same packing arrangement.
This structure was solely for use as independent support of the formulation,
consistent with that determined by spectroscopic techniques.

The structure is the one suggested. The asymmetric unit contains
one-half of a molecule on a crystallographic mirror plane and cocrystallized
solvent that was not modeled. The entire molecule is modeled as disordered
over the mirror plane (0.50:0.50). The SiEt3 group is modeled
as additionally disordered over two general positions (0.74:0.26).
Due to the severity of the disorder in the SiEt3 group,
the carbon atoms were refined isotropically. Highly disordered cocrystallized
solvent found in channels along [001] was neither assigned atoms nor
SQUEEZEd,35 because neither treatment made
any significant difference to the overall structural quality.

A summary of the crystal data is given in the Supporting Information
(Table S1).
