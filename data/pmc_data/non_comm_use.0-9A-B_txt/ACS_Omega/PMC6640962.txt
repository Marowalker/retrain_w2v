A fully nanoporous
Fe-rich alloy, prepared by selective dissolution
of melt-spun Fe43.5Cu56.5 ribbons, exhibits
outstanding properties as a heterogeneous Fenton catalyst toward the
degradation of methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution. In addition,
the ferromagnetic characteristics of this material enable its wireless
manipulation toward specific locations within polluted wastewater.
The influence of selective dissolution on the microstructure, sample
morphology (surface and cross-section), elemental composition, and
magnetic properties of the resulting nanoporous alloy is investigated.
The dealloying procedure enhances the saturation magnetization and
drastically increases the catalytic performance (i.e., the time required
for full degradation of MO from the medium is reduced by a factor
of approximately 2 by subjecting the Fe43.5Cu56.5 ribbons to prior dealloying). Remarkably, the effectiveness of this
nanoporous material surpasses the results obtained by the homogeneous
Fenton reaction using an equivalent concentration of Fe cations leached
into the media from the nanoporous alloy. The different factors that
promote the high catalytic activity are discussed. The outstanding
catalytic activity, together with the simplicity of the synthetic
procedure, makes this material very appealing for water remediation
using advanced Fenton processes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With
the massive growth in industrial and agricultural activities,
water pollution has become one of the major environmental threats
to human health and ecosystems in general.1 Over the last few decades, various types of physical, chemical,
and biological methods have been introduced to remove nondegradable
organic compounds from industrial wastewater. However, most of these
methods suffer from important drawbacks. For instance, physical methods,
such as liquid–liquid extraction or ion-exchange, are ineffective
for pollutants that are not easily adsorbable or are volatile. Membrane
filtration requires very high water pressure, which in turn causes
large energy power consumption. Activated carbon adsorption processes
are also very costly.2 Ozone and hypochlorite
oxidation processes are efficient, but the costly equipment and secondary
pollution produced by the residual chlorine make them undesirable.3 In fact, many of these methods simply convert
the pollutants to other compounds, rather than actually eliminating
them.4

Remarkably, some advanced
chemical oxidation processes can induce
almost complete mineralization of a wide range of organic pollutants.
For example, Fenton reactions (i.e., iron-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide)
can either oxidize the contaminant materials to smaller organic molecules
or transform them into water, carbon dioxide, and salts.5−13 Besides water remediation, Fenton reactions are also of interest
in biological applications because they involve the creation of free
radicals by chemicals that are present in bodily fluids. Some additional
advantages of Fenton reactions are their high efficiency, simplicity
in destroying contaminants, and non-necessity of sophisticated equipment.14 Moreover, the reaction takes place under ambient
conditions.15 For these reasons, homogeneous
Fenton catalysts (in which Fe cations are directly dissolved in liquid
media) have been widely investigated and are now considered promising
for use in wastewater treatment.16

As an alternative to homogeneous Fenton, some attempts have been
made to develop “heterogeneous” Fenton catalysts, that
is, solid materials that are immersed, but not dissolved, in the media
while providing a high catalytic activity. In principle, some of the
limitations encountered by a homogeneous process might be overcome
by heterogeneous Fenton oxidation processes.17,18 Namely, it has been reported that heterogeneous Fenton oxidation
exhibits a lower activation free energy than that of homogeneous Fenton
reactions.19 Furthermore, during heterogeneous
Fenton reactions, high amounts of surface active sites for H2O2 decomposition and formation of hydroxyl radicals are
available, sometimes inducing a higher removal efficiency compared
to a homogeneous Fenton process.20 Heterogeneous
Fenton catalysts can be prepared by incorporating Fe ions, zero-valence
iron (ZVI), or Fe oxide phases (e.g., in the form on nanoparticles)
into porous scaffolds that act as support materials (e.g., zeolites,
nafion, clay, or activated carbon).21−23 Nevertheless, as the
host material is inactive toward the Fenton reaction, the benefit
brought by the large porosity is not fully exploited. In other words,
the amount of available surface area exposed to the solution (i.e.,
active sites at which the reactant molecules can be adsorbed) is limited
to the nanoparticles. For this reason, a fully porous active material,
instead of active particles embedded in a porous support, might be
a suitable alternative to enhance the Fenton efficiency. In any case,
mechanical integrity of the nanoporous materials is a critical issue
for their use in heterogeneous catalysis experiments.

Interestingly,
it has been shown that mixed iron/copper species
may also promote Fenton-like processes while allowing for a less critical
dependence on the pH value. Indeed, bimetallic Fe–Cu nanoparticles
introduced inside different types of two-dimensional or three-dimensional
porous frameworks have shown a large potential for heterogeneous Fenton
catalytic activity.24−26 Furthermore, as Fe-based materials are often ferromagnetic,
precise guiding of the catalysts toward specific locations of the
polluted water by means of an externally applied magnetic field and
field gradients is possible, while also offering the possibility of
recovering them after use for recycling purposes.27

Over the last few years, progress has been made toward
the development
of nanoporous metallic materials by means of dealloying (i.e., selective
removal of the less noble element from an alloy, by either chemical
or electrochemical means).28 The process
can be applied to various combinations of binary or ternary alloys,
such as Ag–Au, Pt–Al, Al–Pd–Au, Ni–Mn,
Ni–Pd, or Fe–Cu, among others. In particular, it has
been reported that the phase-separated Fe–Cu binary alloy,
with a composition around Fe43Cu57, can be selectively
etched to remove Cu and render an Fe-rich metallic alloy featuring
nanometer-sized pores.29 Although detailed
structural characterization of this type of material has been previously
reported,29 most of its physical and catalytic
properties, as well as its potential applications, have been largely
overlooked. In this study, a three-dimensional nanoporous Fe-rich
alloy is prepared by dealloying Fe43.5Cu56.5 ribbons previously synthesized by rapid solidification (see Figure 1). The phase structure,
morphology, elemental composition, and magnetic properties of the
ribbons before and after selective dissolution are investigated in
detail. The degradation performance of methyl orange (MO) during Fenton
reactions using dense as-spun and nanoporous dealloyed ribbons is
assessed. Remarkably, the nanoporous material outperforms the as-quenched
nondealloyed sample. The highly efficient catalytic activity and convenient
processing method make this nanoporous catalyst a prospective new
candidate for heterogeneous Fenton chemistry.

the dealloying process used to obtain Fe-rich
nanoporous ribbons and the efficiency of the as-spun Fe–Cu
and dealloyed ribbons for degradation of MO using the Fenton reaction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Morphological Characterization
As shown
in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Figure 2, typical peaks of fcc-Cu and
bcc-Fe phases can be identified in the as-spun ribbon, which indicate
the occurrence of phase separation. However, after selective etching,
the peaks from fcc-Cu almost vanished, whereas those from bcc-Fe remained
clearly visible. This demonstrates that the dealloying treatment is
very effective in drastically reducing the amount of the fcc-Cu phase.

Figure 2 XRD patterns
of the Fe43.5Cu56.5 alloy before
and after selective dissolution in 0.1 M HNO3 at an applied
voltage of 14 V for 5 min. The peaks correspond to the fcc-Cu (black
filled circle) and bcc-Fe (open diamond) phases, respectively.

The gradient of the cooling rate
across the ribbon during melt-spinning
causes a variation in the surface morphology and microstructure between
the free side and wheel side of the as-spun ribbon.30 Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images
of both sides of the ribbon, as well as its cross-section, for the
as-spun and dealloyed states, are displayed in Figure 3. Compared with the rather dense appearance
of the as-spun ribbon (Figure 3a), a fully porous morphology is observed after selective
etching (Figure 3b).
However, the pore size of the dealloyed sample varies from ∼50–100
to ∼500 nm when comparing the wheel side with the free side
(cf. Figure 3b,c).
To some extent, this could actually be anticipated, as the microstructure
at the wheel side (faster cooling rate) is more refined than that
at the air side. The ligaments are rather elongated and mostly oriented
parallel to the ribbon plane, their size varying between ∼50
and ∼300 nm.

the
dealloyed ribbon: (b) wheel side, (c) free side, and (d) fracture
cross-section.

Cross-sectional analyses
of the dealloyed ribbon indicated that
etching and hence the occurrence of porosity were accomplished through
the entire ribbon thickness (Figure 3d). A low-magnification SEM image of the cross-section
is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
The compositions of the ribbons, measured by energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) analyses at different locations of the samples before and after
dealloying, are listed in Table 1. Slight variations in the amounts of Fe and Cu exist
between the wheel and free sides of the as-spun ribbons. Remarkably,
a clear enrichment in Fe is observed in the dealloyed nanoporous ribbons,
which is in agreement with the XRD results. The oxygen content also
increases a bit after dealloying, although it typically remains below
20 atom %. The occurrence of O is likely attributed to the formation
of Fe oxides during electrochemical polarization. However, oxide peaks
could not be detected by XRD, indicating that the oxide layer is exceedingly
thin in comparison to the penetration depth of the X-rays.

2.2 Magnetic Properties
Figure 4 shows the
hysteresis loops
of the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons, from which a soft ferromagnetic
behavior is observed. The values of saturation magnetization (Ms), remanence (Mr), and coercivity (Hc) for both samples
are listed in Table 2. In general, these two materials display similar magnetic properties,
which stem from the bcc-Fe-rich phase.31 However, the nanoporous (dealloyed) Fe-rich alloy possesses higher Ms, Mr, and Hc values than those of the as-spun ribbon. The
increase in Mr and Ms after dealloying can be ascribed to the removal of the paramagnetic
Cu-rich phase by selective dissolution.31,32 However, the
saturation magnetization of the dealloyed ribbon is still lower than
that of bulk Fe (where Ms = 218 emu g–1),33 due to the presence
of Cu and O, in agreement with EDX analyses. For both samples, the
values of Hc are higher than the typical
ones for bulk Fe (of only a few Oe)33 and
are similar to the Hc measured in other
types of Fe-based ribbons.34 The slightly
larger Hc after dealloying could be due
to the hindrances for domain-wall propagation imposed by the reduced
lateral dimensions of the ligaments constituting the nanoporous ribbons.

2.3 Surface Characterization
X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the ribbons after dealloying
was carried out to identify eventual changes in both the oxidation
state and amounts of Fe and Cu at the surface level. The survey spectra
(Figure 5) showed an
increase in the Fe 2p signal and, concomitantly, a decrease in the
Cu 2p peak after dealloying, in agreement with EDX analyses.

Figure 5 XPS survey
spectra of the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons before
and after the Fenton reaction.

Deconvoluted core-level Fe 2p spectra of the dealloyed sample
are
shown in Figure 6a,c.
The two doublets located between 717 and 705 eV (2p3/2)
and between 730 and 720 eV (2p1/2) indicate that iron is
mostly in its oxidized state (Fe2+ and Fe3+).
Interestingly, the relative amount of Fe3+ in the dealloyed
sample is higher than that in the as-spun one (see Figure S2a for comparison), hence indicating that the outermost
surface of the dealloyed ribbon is more oxidized. The weak shoulder
peak at around 706.1 eV, observed both before and after dealloying,
can be ascribed to ZVI (2p3/2). Remarkably, the ZVI signal
became very strong after Ar-ion sputtering (Figure 6c), by which the outermost surface is removed.35 Simultaneously, the contribution from oxidized
Fe is strongly reduced.

XPS spectra of (a)
Fe 2p and (b) O 1s at the surface level and of (c) Fe 2p and (d) O
1s after 1 min of Ar ions sputtering for the dealloyed ribbon (before
the Fenton reaction).

The core-level Cu 2p spectra of the as-spun and dealloyed
(the
latter taken at the surface level and after Ar-ion sputtering) samples
are shown in Figure S3. Cu mostly remains
as a mixture of Cu0, Cu+, and Cu2+ in the as-spun sample. As expected, its contribution markedly reduces
in the dealloyed ribbon. After Ar-ion sputtering, clear Cu peaks emerge
again, in agreement with the results from Table 1; that is, Cu is not fully removed but a
moderate amount (20 atom %) remains in the material. Findings from
the analysis of the core-level O 1s spectra (Figure 6b,d) are in agreement with the previously
observed features. Fe and Cu oxides are present at the surface of
both the as-spun (Figure S2b) and dealloyed
(Figure 6b) ribbons,
with some differences. Namely, the relative fraction of Cu oxides
is higher in the as-spun sample, in accordance with the favored removal
of Cu during dealloying. After sputtering the dealloyed ribbon with
Ar ions, the O signal clearly decreases (Figure 6d), which is in agreement with the detection
of a large proportion of Fe and Cu in the metallic state (see Figures 6c and S3).

The results gleaned from XPS analyses
of the ribbons can be summarized
as follows: after dealloying, the surface is mainly covered by iron
oxide precipitates, as the Cu-rich phase is removed by selective dissolution;
underneath, the amount of oxides is lowered and metallic Fe clearly
emerges (in agreement with the bcc-Fe phase observed by XRD).

2.4 Fenton Reaction
In Fenton-like heterogeneous
reactions, catalysis originates from the surface of the catalyst.36 Hence, the adsorption of H2O2 and other reactants at the catalyst surface plays an important
role. In the presence of H2O2, Fe0 oxidizes to Fe2+ by the transfer of two electrons, as
shown in eq 1 1  In the classical
Fenton reaction, the production
cycle of hydroxyl radicals can be represented as follows37 2   3  Furthermore, the ferric
ions can be reduced
to ferrous ions by the ZVI surface, hence promoting the sustained
production cycle of hydroxyl radicals 4  In this work,
both as-spun and dealloyed nanoporous
Fe-rich ribbons show iron oxides and ZVI (the latter in a smaller
amount) on the surface. The sustainability of the hydroxyl generation
cycle (eqs 1–3) thus depends on the ease of ferrous-ion availability.
In this sense, acidity is a crucial parameter for the Fenton oxidation.
OH• radicals cleave azo bonds (−N=N−)
in MO previously adsorbed on the catalyst surface, leading to decolorization
of the dye solution (Figure 1). The sorption rate can be one of the main controlling factors
during the whole catalytic oxidation reaction.37

2.4.1 Catalytic Performance of the Ribbons
The catalytic performance
of the ribbons was investigated by following the decomposition of
MO in an aqueous solution at pH 3 and at a [MO]/[ H2O2]/[ Fe2+] ratio given by38  Figure 7a shows the removal
efficiency of MO in aqueous solution for
both as-spun and dealloyed ribbons, as well as the behavior of a blank
solution without catalyst. The results reveal that the dealloyed nanoporous
ribbon is much more efficient than the as-spun ribbon in degrading
MO. Full degradation of MO occurs in less than 20 min when using the
dealloyed ribbon, whereas it takes about 50 min to completely degrade
the dye in the presence of the as-spun ribbon. As expected, no significant
degradation of MO was observed in the absence of catalyst, which was
taken as a reference (blank).

Figure 7 Dependence of the MO concentration as a function
of time (i.e.,
removal efficiency of MO) for the (a) as-spun and dealloyed ribbons
and (b) salt solutions (homogeneous Fenton) with the same concentrations
of Fe ions as the ones obtained after long-term immersion of the heterogeneous
catalysts. All experiments were performed at room temperature for
1 h, at pH 3, and with the addition of 0.1 g L–1 H2O2 and 50 mg L–1 MO.

Additionally, inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) measurements obtained
from the aqueous solution after the Fenton reaction reveal that dissolution
of iron from the ribbons occurs during the experiments (see Table 3). Actually, the Fe
dissolution is higher in the porous dealloyed sample because 7.58
ppm of Fe is found in this case, whereas only 5.42 ppm of Fe is detected
for the as-spun sample after Fenton, which could be explained by the
increase in the surface area-to-volume ratio in the nanoporous dealloyed
ribbons. The production of ferrous ions accelerates the decomposition
of H2O2 and the degradation of MO as the Fenton
process proceeds, suggesting a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous
degradation reactions when Fe-based alloys are used.39 To assess the contribution of dissolved iron to the overall
degradation process of MO, additional Fenton reactions were performed
using FeSO4 as the iron source. Salt dosages were calculated
to provide Fe concentrations of 7.58 and 5.42 ppm. As shown in Figure 7b, rapid degradation
of MO within the first minute of the assay is observed at both iron
concentrations. After this point, reaction rates slow significantly
until the complete degradation of MO. This effect might be explained
by the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle. Thus, when ferrous iron
is used, the initial rate of H2O2 decomposition
is very rapid. Therefore, the rate of production of OH• and Fe3+ is equally rapid (eq 2). However, with the rapid exhaustion of Fe2+, the rate of OH• production also decreases.
At this stage, the concentration of ferrous ions depends on the decomposition
reaction of Fe3+ in presence of H2O2 (eq 3), and this reaction
is much slower than the former one.

Table 3 Dissolved Fe and
Cu Amounts during
the Fenton Reaction Measured by ICP
material	Fe, ppm	Cu, ppm	
polished as-spun ribbon	5.42	0.73	
dealloyed ribbon	7.58	1.78	
As expected, the experiment at the highest iron concentration
gives
the fastest degradation rate. However, when comparing the results
of the two sets of experiments (FeSO4 and Fe-based ribbons)
it was observed that the overall process for complete elimination
of MO takes longer for FeSO4 than for their corresponding
Fe-based ribbon counterparts. This result indicates that the use of
Fe-based alloys is advantageous compared to the use of the conventional
FeSO4 reagent. An induction time might be expected to generate
surface active iron species.40 However,
in our investigation, we did not observe any induction time for the
dealloyed sample, whereas a short induction time could be perceived
with the as-spun sample (see Figure 7). In the case of the dealloyed ribbons, this means
that the iron species are already available from the very beginning
and thus the Fenton reaction takes place immediately.37 The presence of iron ion species on the surface of the
catalyst was actually confirmed by XPS (see Figures 6 and S2).

The enhancement of the catalytic activity of Fe-based alloys might
be ascribed to their ability to generate surface hydroxyl radicals
and the promotion of Fe2+ regeneration at the Fe-based
alloy surface (eq 4).41 Additionally their capacity to continuously
release ferrous ions into the solution avoids the rapid consumption
of Fe2+ and the overload of ferric ions that decreases
the degradation rate in the conventional Fenton processes.42 Actually, in some heterogeneous systems in which
the catalytic solid materials serve as a source of metal ions, even
submicromolar concentrations of dissolved metal ions contribute to
the increase in the degradation rate of the organic contaminant.43,44 The multiple and complex mechanisms responsible for heterogeneous
Fenton reactions have not been fully elucidated yet and remain a topic
of extensive investigations.43 Finally,
the higher catalytic activity of the dealloyed ribbons compared to
that of the as-spun ones could be assigned to a combination of a higher
active surface and iron content. It is believed that the homogeneous
Fenton mechanism induced by surface-leached iron and the heterogeneous
catalysis mechanism compete differently in the as-cast and porous
ribbons.

2.4.2 Structural and Morphological
Characterization
of the Ribbons after the Fenton Reaction
The XRD patterns
of the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons after the Fenton reaction are
rather similar to each other, as shown in Figure 8. The main peaks can be assigned to the fcc-Cu,
Cu2O, and η-Fe2O3 (JCPDS Card
No. 21-0920) phases. It is thus clear that bcc-Fe tends to dissolve
into the solution during the Fenton process, in agreement with ICP
analyses (Section 2.4.1). The relative intensity of the η-Fe2O3 peaks is slightly higher for the as-spun ribbons, suggesting
that dissolution of Fe is more pronounced in the dealloyed ribbon,
probably because of its inherent nanoporosity (also in agreement with
ICP analyses). The surfaces of the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons after
the Fenton reaction are covered by Cu oxides, as confirmed by EDX
(Table 1).

Figure 8 XRD patterns
of the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons after the Fenton
reaction. The peaks correspond to the fcc-Cu (black filled circle),
Cu2O (black club suit), and η-Fe2O3 (open triangle) phases separately.

In addition, the surface morphology after the Fenton reaction
(Figure 9a,c) becomes
denser
than that before Fenton (Figure 3a,b), particularly in the dealloyed ribbon. The cross-sectional
images (Figure 9b,d)
show that inside the ribbons the morphology remains similar to that
before the Fenton reaction, that is, the dealloyed ribbons exhibit
a more obvious nanoporosity. Furthermore, according to EDX, the signal
from Fe is very weak after Fenton. A rather low amount of Fe could
be detected (2 and 3 atom % for the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons
after the Fenton reaction, respectively). Remarkably, in spite of
the partial dissolution of the dealloyed ribbons during the Fenton
reaction, their mechanical integrity was preserved so that the ribbons
could be in any case manipulated, even after Fenton studies, for further
detailed structural and magnetic characterization. The magnetic hysteresis
loops of the samples after the Fenton reaction are displayed in Figure S4, and the corresponding relevant parameters
are listed in Table 2. Compared to that of the samples before Fenton, it is obvious that
the saturation magnetization of the ribbons after the Fenton reaction
decreases significantly. However, clear hysteresis loops with well-defined
values of Mr and Hc (inset of Figure S4) indicate
there is an obvious ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic contribution, which
probably stems from the η-Fe2O3 phase
detected by XRD.45 The lower Ms of the dealloyed ribbon after the Fenton process is
probably the consequence of the smaller percentage of the η-Fe2O3 phase in this sample as compared to that in
the as-spun ribbon after Fenton, as discussed above.

the Fenton reaction on: (a) the wheel side
and (b) the fracture cross-section of the as-spun ribbon and (c) the
wheel side and (d) cross-section of the dealloyed ribbon.

2.4.3 Surface Analysis of the
Ribbons after the
Fenton Reaction
From the general XPS surface spectra acquired
after the Fenton reaction (Figure 5), the intensity of the Fe peaks is found to significantly
decrease for both the as-spun and dealloyed ribbons. This result is
even more obvious on analyzing the high-resolution Fe 2p region (see Figures S5a and 10a).
The deconvoluted contributions indicate the presence of oxidized iron
in both cases.

Figure 10 Experimental and deconvoluted high-resolution XPS spectra
of (a)
Fe 2p and (b) O 1s at the surface level and of (c) Fe 2p and (d) O
1s after 1 min Ar-ion sputtering for the dealloyed ribbon after the
Fenton reaction.

After Ar-ion sputtering,
the Fe signal increases but it still remains
low. This is in agreement with the remarkable leaching of Fe ions
during the Fenton reaction. The core-level Cu 2p (Figure S6) and O 1s (Figures S5b,d and 10b,d) spectra of the two ribbons after
the Fenton reaction are very similar, either at the outermost
surface or deeper inside the material (i.e., after Ar-ion sputtering).
Accordingly, the resulting surfaces after the Fenton reaction are
mostly composed of Cu oxides. Interestingly, the Cu(II)/Cu(I) ratio
is larger at the surface, indicating that the oxidation degree is
higher, as expected from the Fenton reaction.

3 Conclusions
Fully nanoporous Fe-rich ribbons, with a bcc
crystallographic structure
and a pore size ranging from 50 to 500 nm, have been obtained by selective
dissolution of the fcc-Cu phase from phase-separated Fe43.5Cu56.5 ribbons previously prepared by melt-spinning. The
nanoporous Fe-rich alloy possesses a higher Ms and slightly higher Mr and Hc than those of the ribbons before dealloying,
which can be ascribed to the removal of the paramagnetic Cu-rich phase.
The ferromagnetic properties of these ribbons might be used to magnetically
guide them toward specific locations in polluted water tanks to degrade
organic matter. The dealloyed ribbons exhibited sufficient mechanical
integrity during the Fenton reaction processes so that magnetic guiding
could indeed be accomplished. Remarkably, the nanoporous dealloyed
material is found to be very efficient in degrading MO in an aqueous
solution at pH 3, thus acting as an efficient heterogeneous Fenton
catalyst. The time needed to fully degrade MO when using the dealloyed
ribbon is reduced by roughly a factor 2 as compared to that of the
as-spun Fe–Cu ribbons. The efficiency of this catalyst also
surpasses that of a homogeneous Fenton reaction when using analogous
Fe cation concentrations to those in the aqueous media. The higher
catalytic activity of dealloyed ribbons is likely due to its higher
surface area and high iron content. Overall, their ability to generate
surface hydroxyl radicals, the regeneration of Fe2+ at
their surfaces, and the sustained
release of ferrous ions into the solution avoid the rapid consumption
of Fe2+ and the overload of ferric ions responsible for
the decreased degradation rate in conventional Fenton processes. The
combination of highly efficient catalytic activity and convenient
production processing makes this nanoporous Fe-rich alloy an interesting
candidate material for Fenton catalysis.

4 Experimental
Procedures
4.1 Synthesis
Alloy ingots with a nominal
composition, Fe43.5Cu56.5, were prepared by
arc-melting mixtures of high-purity Fe (99.95 wt %) and Cu (99.95
wt %) metals in a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere (the exact alloy composition
was determined by EDX, as shown in Table 1). Then, a few pieces of the ingots were
remelted and injected into a Cu single roller. Ribbons that were about
1.5 mm wide and 20–25 μm thick were produced by melt-spinning
in an argon atmosphere. Subsequently, the ribbons were cut into 30–40
mm long pieces, which were mechanically polished using 4000 grit SiC
paper and ultrasonically cleaned in distilled water for 3 min before
dealloying. Selective dissolution to obtain the nanoporous ribbon
was performed by electrochemical treatment in a 0.065 M HNO3 solution with an applied voltage of 14 V for 5 min, followed by
washing in distilled water (see Figure 1). Both the electrolyte composition and applied voltage
were selected on the basis of the electrochemical behavior of the
individual elements according to the standard Pourbaix diagrams.29,46

4.2 Characterization
Structural characterization
of the as-spun and dealloyed samples was carried out by XRD on a Philips
X’Pert diffractometer with a pixel one-dimensional detector
in the 20–100° 2θ range (step size = 0.026°,
total time = 2000 s) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178
nm). The surface morphology and fracture cross-section of the ribbons
were observed by FESEM (Zeiss Merlin). Hysteresis loops were recorded
at room temperature by means of a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)
from MicroSense. XPS experiments were performed on a PHI 5500 Multitechnique
System (from Physical Electronics), with a monochromatic X-ray source
(Al Kα line of 1486.6 eV energy and 350 W), under ultrahigh
vacuum and a pressure between 5 × 10–9 and
2 × 10–8 torr, placed perpendicular to the
analyzer axis and calibrated using the 3d5/2 line of Ag,
with a full width at half-maximum of 0.8 eV. The analyzed area was
a circle of 0.8 mm diameter for each sample. The selected resolution
for the spectra was 187.85 eV of pass energy and 0.8 eV/step for the
general spectra and 23.5 eV of pass energy and 0.1 eV/step for the
detailed spectra of the different elements. Composition depth profiles
of the dealloyed sample were obtained by sputtering the surface with
Ar+ ions (4 keV energy) for 1 min (about 5–10 nm
deep from the sample’s surface). Charging effects were corrected
by referencing the binding energies to those of the adventitious C
1s line at 284.5 eV. A linear background was assumed.47 The energy of the deconvoluted peaks was compared to that
in the NIST XPS database.48

4.3 Fenton Process and Analysis of Samples after
the Fenton Reaction
To evaluate the catalytic activity of
the iron-based ribbon pieces, MO was used as a model dye. MO is a
toxic azo dye usually found in textile wastewater that causes a severe
ecological impact. All chemicals for the Fenton reaction (i.e., MO,
hydrogen peroxide, sodium sulfate, and sulfuric acid) were supplied
by Scharlau and used without further purification. To compare the
catalytic efficiency of the ribbons before and after dealloying, MO
solutions with an initial concentration of 50 mg L–1 were prepared by diluting 1 g L–1 stock solutions
in deionized water. To carry out the experiments, 1.51 mg of the as-spun
ribbon and 1.42 mg of the dealloyed ribbon were introduced, separately,
into a 100 mL MO solution. Then, 710 mg of Na2SO4 (final concentration 50 mM) was added to simulate natural wastewater
pollutants and the pH was adjusted to 3 using H2SO4 (because the reported optimum pH is between 2 and 3 for the
Fenton reaction catalyzed by ZVI).49,50 Separately,
a 0.1 g L–1 H2O2 solution
was also prepared. The reaction was started by adding this H2O2 solution. The solution
mixture was continuously stirred, and the reaction was performed at
room temperature for 1 h or until complete degradation of MO was achieved.
Aliquots were withdrawn every 5 or 10 min from the reaction beaker,
and the concentration of MO was measured using a Jasco V-570 UV spectrophotometer
at a wavelength of 505 nm, which corresponded to the maximum absorption
of the solution at the beginning of the experiment (pH 3). After that,
the aliquot was poured back into the beaker. Additionally, a blank
experiment was performed, in which no ribbon catalyst was added.

The structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the ribbons
after the Fenton reaction were investigated by XRD, FESEM-EDX, and
VSM. The concentrations of the metallic cations leached into the solution
after the Fenton experiments were measured by ICP spectroscopy (ICPE
9000, Shimadzu). For this purpose, 17 and 13 mL of the solution were
extracted from the reaction vessels containing the as-spun and dealloyed
ribbons, respectively. XPS experiments, including compositional depth
measurements, were performed using the same equipment, parameters,
and analysis methodology as those mentioned above. To carry out comparative
homogeneous Fenton reactions, the same procedure was applied using
FeSO4·7H2O instead of Fe-based ribbons.
Salt dosages were chosen to coincide with those measured by ICP at
the end of the previous experiments.
