Hospital-acquired infections can
cause serious complications and
are a severe problem because of the increased emergence of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria. Biophysical modification of the material surfaces to prevent
or reduce bacteria adhesion is an attractive alternative to antibiotic
treatment. Since stainless steel is a widely used material for implants
and in hospital settings, in this work, we used stainless steel to
investigate the effect of the material surface topographies on bacterial
adhesion and early biofilm formation. Stainless steel samples with
different surface roughnesses Rq in a
range of 217.9–56.6 nm (Ra in a
range of 172.5–45.2 nm) were fabricated via electropolishing
and compared for adhesion of bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that the number of viable cells on the untreated rough
surface was at least 10-fold lower than those on the electropolished
surfaces after 4 h of incubation time for P. aeruginosa and 15-fold lower for S. aureus.
Fluorescence images and scanning electron microscopy images revealed
that the bacterial cells tend to adhere individually as single cells
on untreated rough surfaces. In contrast, clusters of the bacterial
cells (microcolonies) were observed on electropolished smooth surfaces.
Our study demonstrates that nanoscale surface roughness can play an
important role in restraining bacterial adhesion and formation of
microcolonies.

1 Introduction
Bacterial
adhesion and biofilm formation on material surfaces can
cause severe health problems as they often lead to microbial contamination
and chronic infections.1,2 Up to date, several approaches
using various alloy compositions and antibacterial coatings have been
developed to control the bacterial adhesion and viability on surfaces.3−6 However, administration of antibacterial agents may cause antimicrobial
resistance problems. In the past decade, the influence of surface
topographies has attracted much attention as micro/nanoscale structures
exhibited antiadhesion properties or direct contact killing of microbes.7−19 The study of microbial retention on micro/nanoscale surface textures
provides bases for further development of novel antimicrobial surfaces.

Stainless steel is an iron-based alloy containing at least 10.5%
Cr with numerous alloying elements that improve the mechanical and
corrosion properties. Surface textures of grooves and ridges are normally
produced using a mechanical wet-grinding process. Smoother surfaces
can be obtained by subsequent electropolishing treatment. The polished
stainless steel is widely used for hospital furniture, equipment,
and devices, as well as for implants such as osteosynthesis screws
and plates, intramedullary nails, and external fixation devices.20 A number of studies have been carried out to
investigate the influence of the surface roughness of stainless steel
on the bacterial adhesion and the conclusions however remain inconsistent.
Some work demonstrated no direct correlation between surface roughness
and the adhesion of bacteria or spores,21−26 whereas others showed a positive correlation between bacterial adhesion
and the surface roughness,27−29 for example, some observed significantly
fewer bacterial cells adhering on electropolished smooth surfaces.30−32 It was also reported that the adhesion of bacteria was minimal at
roughness Ra of 160 nm in a study in which
five types of surface finishes corresponding to roughness values Ra between 30 and 890 nm were compared.33 These discrepancies underline that it is important
to investigate and understand the topographic effect of stainless
steel surfaces on bacterial adhesion properties.

In this work,
stainless steel samples with surface roughness Rq values varying from 217.9 to 56.6 nm (Ra in a range of 172.5–45.2 nm) were prepared
and compared for their properties of binding bacterial cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterial
strain, and Staphylococcus aureus,
a Gram-positive bacterial strain, were taken as the model bacteria.
Viable cells were quantified on untreated and electropolished stainless
steel surfaces. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) were applied to investigate the morphology
of the adhered cells. The obtained images revealed that the nanoscale
surface topographies restrain bacterial adhesion and formation of
microcolonies.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of Stainless Steel Samples
The stainless
steel sheet (4N Wet ground finishes, Outokumpu Tornio
Works, 2012) was cut by a laser processing machine to obtain circular
coupons of 18 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness. The coupons were
first cleaned in an ultrasonic bath (KKS Ultraschall AG, Switzerland)
containing a solution made of 10% (v/v) cleaner KKS 219-5000 for 15
min at 27 kHz and 50–70 °C, followed by 3 min at 27 kHz
and 45–55 °C in a mixture consisting of 4% (v/v) cleaner
KKS 180-7136 and 1% (v/v) cleaner KKS 180-7415 to remove adhesive
residues.34 The coupons were then fixed
by a clamping system for electropolishing process. The coupons were
taken as the anode and chrome–nickel steel as the cathode in
electropolishing electrolyte ElpoLux TM (ElpoChem AG). The stainless
steel substrates were electropolished for various time periods of
20, 60, 120, and 240 s at a voltage of 7 V. The coupons were then
neutralized in the cleaning bath containing 4% (v/v) cleaner KKS 180-7136
and 1% (v/v) cleaner KKS 180-7415 at 45–55 °C.

The
electropolished and nonelectropolished coupons were subjected to a
final cleaning in the ultrasonic bath containing cleaner KKS 180-7026
at 80 kHz and 45–55 °C for 2 min. This treatment was repeated
twice. Finally, the coupons were rinsed with deionized (DI) water,
dried in an oven at 90–120 °C for 15 min, and stored individually
in blister containers in a vacuum package until usage, with the ground
side facing up.

Before the bacterial adhesion experiment, the
samples were sterilized
in 12-well microplates filled with 70% ethanol. After 5 min incubation,
ethanol was removed by aspirating the liquid and the samples were
rinsed by DI water and dried in air.

2.2 Chemical
Reagents
All chemicals and
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland), if
not mentioned otherwise. The cleaners for coupon treatment were purchased
from KKS Ultraschall AG, Switzerland.

2.3 SEM and
Atomic Force Microscopy
SEM
images were taken using a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(Zeiss LEO 1550) at 1 kV under 20k, 30k, and 50k magnifications at
stage angles of 0° and 30°. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images were taken by using a Nanosurf Flex-Axiom setup with tip of
Tap190Al-G.

2.4 Surface Characterization
by X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed with scanning XPS microprobe (PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer,
Physical Electronics) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6
eV) and a takeoff angle of 45° (with respect to the surface plane)
as described previously.35 The operating
pressure of the analysis chamber was below 5 × 10–7 Pa during the measurements. Two sets of independently prepared samples
were analyzed. Areas, each of 800 μm × 800 μm size,
were randomly chosen on each sample and analyzed using a microfocused,
scanned X-ray beam with a diameter of 100 μm (operated at a
power of 25 W at 15 kV). Survey scan spectra (0–1100 eV) were
acquired with an energy step width of 0.8 eV, an acquisition time
of 20 ms per data point, and a pass energy of 187 eV.

2.5 Surface Hydrophobicity
Using the
drop shape analyzer DSA25E (Krüss GmbH, Hamburg, Germany),
the surface hydrophobicity was assessed by measuring the contact angle
between the samples and a drop of DI water or diiodomethane. Two independent
experiments with two sets of independently prepared samples were performed.
For each sample, three drops were measured.

2.6 Zeta
Potential Measurement
Surface
zeta potential of the stainless steel samples was measured using Nano
ZSP (Malvern Instruments) with a surface zeta potential dip cell (ZEN1020).
The samples were cut into a size of 2 × 3 × 1 mm3 (L × W × H), and the zeta potential was measured according to the manufacturer
instruction and previously described procedure.36 For calibration, 25 mL of a solution was prepared by diluting
2.5 μL of micromer PEGylated polystyrene particles (micromod
Partikeltechnologie GmbH, monodispersed, Germany, size of the particles:
1 μm; initial particle concentration: 50 mg/mL) in a phosphate
buffer solution. The final solution had a concentration of 5 μg/mL
at a pH of 7.0.

2.7 Quantification of Bacterial
Viability
S. aureus (DSMZ
20231) and P. aeruginosa (DSMZ 1117)
were used in this work.
Bacteria from glycerol stocks were cultivated on Tryptic Soy Agar
plates. A single colony was transferred to 10 mL of culture medium
containing 30% Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and 0.25% glucose and incubated
overnight at 37 °C and 160 rpm. Overnight culture (1 mL) was
added to 10 mL of fresh TSB and incubated until it had reached the
exponential growth phase, which took about 2 h. Bacterial cells were
then diluted with 0.9% NaCl to approximate 105 CFU/mL.
The suspension (400 μL), which covered the entire area of the
surfaces, was loaded onto the stainless steel coupon surfaces and
incubated at room temperature for 0, 4, and 24 h without shaking.
The cell suspension was removed by aspirating the liquid and the coupon
samples were washed three times with 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) each to remove nonadhered cells. To release the adhered cells
from the coupons for viable cell quantification, the coupons were
placed into a 50 mL Falcon tube containing 2.5 mL of PBS and sonicated
for 5 min in a sonication water bath (Bransonic 52, Branson Ultrasonics
SA, Carouge, Switzerland) at a frequency of 40 kHz and room temperature,
followed by further vortexing for 15 s. The suspension was then removed
and the number of viable cells in the suspension was evaluated by
the classical colony counting method.37 Two independent experiments with three repeats per sample in each
experiment were performed.

In parallel, to analyze the adhered
bacteria on the coupon surfaces, the PBS-washed coupons were analyzed
with microscopy as described below.

2.8 Analysis
of Bacterial Adhesion Using Fluorescence
Microscopy
A mixture of 5 μM SYTO9 (Life technologies)
and 45 μM propidium iodide (PI) in DI water was freshly prepared
and used to stain bacterial cells as described previously.38 The mixture (400 μL) was added to the
top of the washed sample placed in a microplate well, and the plate
was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The staining
mixture was removed and the wells with samples were washed three times
with 2 mL of ddH2O. The samples were then analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy (Leica DM6000B). For SYTO9, excitation at 488 nm was used;
the emission was observed at 528 nm, and PI staining was monitored
at excitation at 535 nm and the emission at 590 nm. For each sample,
three images were taken at three fixed locations to obtain a statistical
overview. Two independent experiments with three technical repeats
of each sample per experiment were performed.

2.9 Derjaguin−Landau−Verwey−Overbeek/
Extended Derjagui−Landau−Verwey−Overbeek Model
The classical Derjaguin−Landau−Verwey−Overbeek
(DLVO) and extended Derjaguin−Landau−Verwey−Overbeek
(XDLVO) theories are recently used to estimate the total free energy
of interaction between a bacterium and a flat material surface immersed
in aqueous medium.49 The total free energy
of interaction between a bacterium and a flat substrate immersed in
an aqueous medium is the sum of the attractive Lifshitz van der Waals
energy, the repulsive electrostatic double-layer interaction energy,
and the Lewis acid–base interaction energy. The total interaction
energy as a function of the separation distance can be calculated
by using Derjaguin approximation. Adhesion between two interacting
surfaces occurs when the total energy is negative, and repulsion occurs
when the total energy is positive. The details of the model are provided
in the Supporting Information S3.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Surface
Properties of
Stainless Steel Samples
3.1.1 Surface Roughness
The AFM images
of the stainless steel samples are shown in Figure 1. The topographical profiles extracted from
the AFM images are compared in the Supporting Information Figure S1. An untreated surface exhibits aligned
random alternating micro/nanoscale grooves and ridges (Figure 1A). Typical grooves have peak-to-peak
distance and depth varying from tens of nanometers to several micrometers,
with the surface average roughness Ra of
172.5 nm and root-mean-square roughness Rq of 217.9 nm. Smoother surfaces were obtained after treatment of
electropolishing for 20, 60, 120, and 240 s (Figure 1B–E). Shallow grooves can still be
observed after 20 s of electropolishing, with the surface roughness Ra = 82.4 nm and root-mean-square roughness Rq = 101.6 nm. After electropolishing for 120
s, no obvious grooves or ridges were observed on the sample surface.
The average roughness (Ra) and the root-mean-square
roughness (Rq) for the five types of stainless
steel surfaces are summarized in Table 1.

3.1.2 Surface Chemistry Measured by XPS
XPS
data of the five stainless steel surface types are provided in
the Supporting Information Table S1. After
electropolishing for 20 s, the content of oxygen increases from 30
to 47%. Meanwhile, the content of carbon decreases from 61 to 41%.
The reasons for the changes are likely due to the removal of hydrocarbon
contamination and possible oxidation in the process of electropolishing.
There are no significant differences in element composition between
surfaces with electropolishing times from 20 to 240 s. These results
showed that electropolishing did not introduce contamination to the
metal surfaces, which could have possibly influenced bacterial adhesion.

3.1.3 Surface Hydrophobicity
The contact
angle measurement was conducted using DI water and diiodomethane to
measure the surface hydrophobicity. Interestingly, the contact angle
is anisotropic depending on the orientation of the grooves on rough
surfaces. As shown in Figure 2, on untreated surface with highest roughness values, the
contact angle of water measured perpendicular to the grooves is 77.1°
± 3.5°, exhibiting hydrophilic properties. In contrast,
the contact angle measured in parallel to the grooves is 101.7°
± 1.9°, exhibiting hydrophobic properties. The liquid drops
tend to spread along the grooves, as wetting across the high ridges
requires more energy. The anisotropy of contact angle is not present
on smoother surfaces. As shown in Figure 2, after electropolishing for 60 s, there
is almost no difference in contact angle measured in parallel or perpendicular
to the grooves. Taking the average contact angle measured on the surfaces
of 60, 120, and 240 s electropolished samples, the surface energy
of 26.9 mJ/m2 for stainless steel was calculated based
on the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble model.39 The contact angle data are summarized in Table 1.

Figure 2 Contact angle measured
for different stainless steel surfaces using
DI water and diiodomethane in the direction parallel and perpendicular
to the surface groove textures. P20s, P60s, P120s, and P240s: surfaces
electropolished for 20, 60, 120, and 240 s, respectively. N = 6.

There are two different
models that describe the wetting of rough,
nanostructured surfaces. In the Wenzel model, the liquid completely
penetrates into the nanostructures. The homogeneous wetting on nanostructures
further reduces the contact angle for a hydrophilic surface and further
increases the contact angle for a hydrophilic surface; in the Cassie
model, there is air trapped under the liquid in the nanostructure.
The heterogeneous wetting may lead to the apparent contact angle larger
than 90° for a hydrophilic surface. On the smooth surface of
the stainless steel samples, the contact angle observed perpendicular
to the groove structures is smaller than 90°, whereas on the
rough surface, the contact angle becomes larger than 90°. Therefore,
the Cassie model is considered in our case. The solid fraction Φ
is shown in the Table 1 by taking the 240 s polished surface as the reference.

3.1.4 Surface Charge Measured by Zeta Potential
The zeta
potential of the sample surfaces exhibit similar negative
zeta potential between −47 and −35 mV (Table 1).

In summary, the characterization
of the surface properties suggests that the major difference between
untreated and electropolished surfaces is the surface topography.
The directional wetting phenomenon on the rough surfaces is related
to the surface micro/nanoscale structures and textures rather than
the surface charge potential or chemical composition.

3.2 Comparison of Bacterial Adhesion on Nanorough
and Smooth Surfaces
3.2.1 Viable Bacterial Cells
Adhered on Stainless
Steel Surfaces
By taking P. aeruginosa and S. aureus as the model bacteria,
the adhered viable cells were quantified on rough and smooth surfaces
after 0 and 4 h incubation time. In the case of initial culture (0
h), the number of viable cells was similar on all rough and smooth
surfaces at 3 × 104 CFU/mL for P. aeruginosa and 1.5 × 104 CFU/mL for S. aureus (Figure 3). After
4 h incubation, the number of viable P. aeruginosa cells is reduced by a factor of more than 10 on untreated rough
surfaces (4 × 102 CFU/mL) compared with the electropolished
smoother surfaces [(4–7) × 103 CFU/mL] (Figure 3A). For S. aureus cells, the reduction factor is increased
to be more than 15 on the untreated rough surface (3 × 102 CFU/mL) compared with the smooth surfaces (5 × 103 to 2 × 104 CFU/mL) (Figure 3B). The observations indicate that the rough
surfaces efficiently decrease the number of viable bacteria at the
early stage of biofilm formation.

steel surfaces after 0 and 4 h of incubation time. CFU: colony forming
units; P20s, P60s, P120s, and P240s: surfaces electropolished for
20, 60, 120, and 240 s, respectively. N = 6.

3.2.2 Bacterial
Retention and Cell Morphology
on Stainless Steel Surfaces
The retention of bacteria on
stainless steel surfaces after incubation for 0, 4, and 24 h was analyzed
by fluorescence microscopy and SEM imaging. On all tested surfaces,
very few dead cells could be found (Figure S2). Therefore, the total number of cells (stained in green with Syto9)
was considered here. For the P. aeruginosa strain, in the case of initial incubation (0 h), individual cells
distributed on surfaces were observed for all samples as shown in Figure 4A. After 4 h incubation,
cluster of cells started to form, especially on the 120 and 240 s
electropolished smooth surfaces. After 24 h incubation, dense and
homogeneously distributed microcolonies could be observed on 60, 120,
and 240 s electropolished surfaces (Figure 4A). On the rough untreated surface, there
were large amounts of fluorescent substances filling in the aligned
grooves and also covering over the ridges. Although the amount of
the fluorescent substances was much less on the surface electropolished
for 20 s, such an aligned pattern along the longitudinal grooves was
still distinguishable. SEM images in Figure 4B reveal that these fluorescent substances
are likely to be extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) secreted
by the adhered P. aeruginosa cells.
The SEM images also demonstrate the formation of cell microcolonies
on smooth surfaces.

time. (A) Fluorescence images after cells being stained with Syto9,
scale bar: 25 μm and (B) SEM images, scale bar: 1 μm.

In the case of S. aureus shown in Figure 5, bacteria tended
to adhere individually on untreated and 20 s electropolished surfaces
even after 24 h of incubation. Clusters of bacterial cells were formed
on smoother surfaces electropolished for 120 and 240 s after 4 h of
incubation. These clusters of cells further developed into large microcolonies
after 24 h incubation. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, no groove-guided proliferation pattern is observed for S. aureus (Figure 5A). A similar observation has been reported previously
that S. aureus cells are scattered
all over the microrough titanium surface in small clumps of two to
four bacteria, whereas on the electropolished titanium and stainless
steel surfaces, the bacteria were found to aggregate in large clumps.20

incubation time. (A) Fluorescence images after cells being stained

3.3 Theoretical
Model Discussions on the Observed
Bacterial Adhesion
Bacteria adhesion in a dispersed manner
and then progressing to clustering (usually when cell signaling begins)
to finally form microcolonies (clumps) are typical steps during biofilm
formation.40,41 Even though many studies have
been attempted to understand whether and how the surface topography
can influence these steps,21−32 there is still no clear answer up to now. The adhesion and proliferation
of bacteria on material surfaces have been found to be complex biological
processes affected by numerous parameters including material composition,
surface charge, and surface topography.13,42,43 In this work, the major difference between untreated
and electropolished stainless steel surfaces is the surface topography
as summarized in Table 1. We discuss here the effect of surface topographies of stainless
steel on bacterial adhesion and early biofilm formation.

The
interaction of a bacterial cell with a material surface was shown
to follow the principle of colloidal physics described by the classical
Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory,44,45 assuming that bacterial cells are homogenous sphere particles and
the cell appendages are not considered. The total free energy between
a surface and a particle is the sum of their Coulomb and van der Waals
interactions. As bacteria and material surfaces in neutral aqueous
solution are usually negatively charged, the electrostatic Coulomb
interaction is normally repulsive. The Coulomb interaction is dependent
on the ionic strength of the solution. This repulsive energy increases
as the ionic strength decreases because there is less charge shielding
effect of ions in the electrical double layer. The Debye length for
a 0.9% NaCl solution at 15 mM ionic strength is 1.8 nm. It is generally
considered that the region of varying potential extends to a distance
of about three times of the Debye length before the potential has
decayed to about 2% of its value at the surface. The competing attractive
van der Waals force is short-ranged, which is dominant in the vicinity
of a surface within several nanometers. Under these conditions, the
total free energy leads to an energy barrier, which the bacterial
cells cannot surmount by Brownian motion, and a shallow secondary
energy minimum outside of the energy barrier.42 In the later extended DLVO (XDLVO) theory, the additional Lewis
acid–base interaction energy was considered.46,47 This strong acid–base interaction leads to a decrease of
the energy barrier and deeper secondary energy minimum. The distance
dependence of acid–base interactions is also short-ranged.
The calculations have shown that a distance between the interacting
surfaces of less than 5 nm is required.48

On the basis of the DLVO theory, the bacterial cells initially
reach the secondary energy minimum position by Brownian motion or
motility. Afterward, the bacteria produce EPS or use nanofibers such
as pili and flagella to adhere irreversibly on the surface. The bacteria
adhere irreversibly even on negatively charged material surfaces,
when they tend to get a close contact, and maximize the contact area
with the material surface to gain total free energy. Experimentally,
it has been reported that the bacteria retained preferably in the
grain boundaries or aligned within the grooves of the stainless steel
surface with the width comparable to the diameter of the bacterial
cells.33

The total interaction free
energy between a bacterial cell and
the stainless steel surface using DLVO and XDLVO theories is shown
in Figure 6. The parameters
for the calculation are listed in the Supporting Information S3. The energy barrier is 83 kT calculated from
the classical DLVO theory. This barrier height is reduced to be nearly
half when additional Lewis acid–base interaction energy is
considered. A shallow secondary energy minimum at several kT outside
of the energy barrier is observed at distance 5–7 nm to the
surface. The energy barrier appears at a distance smaller than 4 nm.
Once the energy barrier is surmounted by the secretion of EPS or nanofibers
such as pili and flagella, the bacteria adhere irreversibly on the
surface.

Figure 6 Total interaction free energy between a bacterial cell and the
stainless steel surface based on DLVO and XDLVO theories.

When the surface features reach nanoscale, the
total surface area
of the surface is increased, but the actual contact area of the material
surface with the bacterial cell can either be increased or decreased
depending on the topographical features of the nanostructures. The
AFM images of the stainless steel surfaces at a scale of 3 μm
are compared in the Supporting Information Figure S1. Grooves and trenches with depth larger than 30 nm and
width smaller than 1 μm are only visible on the untreated surface.
With the treatment of electropolishing, the surfaces become smooth
with peak height less than 10 nm. The contact area and therefore the
total free energy gain will increase on a surface with low roughness
with low peak density and small peak height as sketched in Figure 7A. On a surface with
high roughness, high peak density, and large peak height, as the widths
of the grooves and trenches are smaller than the dimensions of the
bacterial cells, the bacteria are actually suspended between the grooves
rather than confined inside the groove cavities. The actual contact
area between the bacterium and the surface will decrease as demonstrated
in Figure 7B. As both
the van der Waals and acid–base interactions are short-ranged
(smaller than 5 nm), the total energy gain on a rough surface with
large peak density and height will be orders of magnitude smaller.
The effect of nanoscale surface roughness on the total interaction
energy was recently described in a three-dimensional model, where
the average height and peak density of surface structures were considered.49 Lower peak density contributes to larger total
energy gain for average height structures below 70 nm, whereas for
surfaces with average height structures larger than 150 nm, the energy
gain is smaller and the peak density is of minor significance. According
to the model, stronger bacterial adhesion should take place on the
surfaces with low roughness and low peak density. Indeed, in our experiments,
more than 10-fold viable cells were observed on electropolished surfaces
after 4 h incubation.

Figure 7 Schematic illustration of bacterial adhesion on nanoscale
rough
surface (A) and smooth surface (B). The cell membrane is deformed
and elongated on the nanoscale rough surface topography.

The adhesion and proliferation of bacteria on material
surfaces
are divided into several steps. After initial adhesion, the irreversibly
attached bacteria start to grow, divide, and form microcolonies. We
have observed the least adhered bacteria on the rough surface with
smallest solid fraction. The results indicate that the bacterial adhesion
may also be reduced by less actual contact area due to trapped air
in the cavities. The production of additional EPS helps strong binding
and stabilization of the cells on the surface. This is obvious for P. aeruginosa, which is able to produce a significant
amount of EPS on surfaces.50,51 It has been reported
that the bacteria tend to maximize the contact area with nanoscale
structures.52 The cells suspending on nanopillar
arrays may cause the elongation of the cell membrane, leading even
to cell rupture and death.53 On the nanoscale
groove structures, the cell membrane is likely slightly deformed and
elongated on the topography because of cell gravity and the energy
gain by maximizing the contact area with substrate as illustrated
in Figure 7. In our
study, the bacteria adhered individually on the untreated rough surface,
contrasting with clusters of bacterial cells on electropolished smooth
surfaces. On nanoscale rough surfaces, the cell proliferation may
be suppressed by the deformation of the cell membrane. After 24 h
of incubation, clear clusters and microcolonies of S. aureus appeared on smooth surfaces of 120 and
240 s electropolished samples, whereas individually distributed cells
were still visible on rough surfaces. For P. aeruginosa, microcolonies were formed on smooth surfaces already after 4 h
incubation. It was reported recently that the morphology of the bacterial
microcolonies was affected by the surface charge. Mushroom-like microcolonies
with high levels of cyclic diguanylate were formed on negatively charged
surfaces, which indicates increased production of matrix components
such as EPS to develop biofilms.54 In our
work, the development of early biofilm was clearly suppressed on rough
surfaces. Our observations suggest that the nanoscale surface topographies
may prohibit the proliferation of adhered bacteria at early stage.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we have studied
the influence of micro/nanotopographies
of stainless steel surfaces on bacterial adhesion and formation of
early biofilm. In total, five types of surfaces with roughness Rq varying from 217.9 to 56.6 nm (Ra in a range of 172.5–45.2 nm) were compared for
their properties of adhering bacterial cells and influencing cell
proliferation. The surface structure of the untreated rough surface
is multiscale. Large grooves are tens of micrometers wide and more
than 500 nm deep. Nanoscale grooves and trenches have depth larger
than 30 nm and width smaller than 1 μm. Qualitative and quantitative
results of adhesion analysis on the different surfaces correlated
with each other and showed significantly more bacterial cells on the
electropolished smooth surfaces than on the untreated one after 4
h of incubation time. Interestingly, on untreated rough surfaces,
the bacterial cells were scattered all over in small clumps, whereas
on the electropolished smooth surfaces, the bacteria were found to
clump in large clusters. Our observations demonstrate that the nanoscale
surface topographies restrain bacterial adhesion and formation of
microcolonies.
