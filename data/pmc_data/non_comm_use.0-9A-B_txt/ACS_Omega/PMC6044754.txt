Cadmium, a heavy
metal pollutant, causes cancer. The existence
of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumors is widely considered to be the
reason for the recurrence and treatment failure of cancer.
Increasing evidence has confirmed that under certain conditions non-CSCs
could be converted into CSCs. The impact of cadmium on the development
of CSC lineage in the bulk tumor cell population is not yet studied.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cadmium on the
conversion of non-CSCs to CSCs and the identification of CSCs based
on the concurrent monitoring of multiple CSC markers. High-content
monitoring of molecular markers was performed using quantum dot (QD)
nanoprobes and an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF)-based imaging
device. Cadmium treatment significantly increased the CSC population
in MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines. The cadmium-induced CSCs were identified
by a concurrent analysis of stem-cell markers, namely, CD44, CD24,
CD133, and ALDH1. Moreover, increased m-RNA expression of CD44, ALDH1,
and CD133 and protein expression of p-Ras, p-Raf-1, p-MEK-1, and p-ERK-1
were observed in the cadmium-treated MCF-7 and HepG2 cells.
This study demonstrates that cadmium induces the gene expression of
CSC markers in the breast and liver cancer cell lineage and promotes
the conversion of non-CSCs to CSCs.

Introduction
Cancer is the second major cause of death
worldwide. Several environmental
reports indicated that the incidence of cancer increased in proportion
to the levels of environmental pollutants.1,2 Heavy
metal pollutants have been reported to inflict a wide array of health
risks, including cancer, on the human population. Cadmium is one of
the major heavy metal pollutants, and it is widely used in the metal
industry, paint industry, and plastic industry and in the preparation
of rechargeable nickel–cadmium batteries. Improper disposal
of heavy metals is a major concern because they cannot be biodegraded
and can accumulate in living organisms existing in the food web.3 Many global health reports indicated that continuous
exposure to cadmium poses a cancer risk to the human population. Industrial
emissions and effluents of a lead–zinc mine are the major source
of cadmium contamination. Cigarette smoking is a major exposure to
cadmium. The cadmium content in the tobacco ranges between 1 and 2
μg/g dry weight, and the average cadmium content per cigarette
ranges between 0.5 and 1 μg.4 It
has been reported that blood cadmium levels in smokers are generally
twice those of nonsmokers.5 Apart from
cigarette smoking, another major exposure to cadmium is the consumption
of cadmium-contaminated water and food. Because of its poor metabolic
excretion and long half-life (15–30 years), cadmium generally
accumulates in the liver and kidney and causes liver, prostate, and
lung cancer. Cadmium and its compounds are currently classified by
International Agency for Research as a group 1 carcinogen for humans.

Despite the advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and monoclonal
antibody therapy in cancer treatment, the occurrence of treatment
failure is still a major concern. The inherent drug-resistance mechanism
of cancer reduces the survival chances of patients.6 One of the well-proven and accepted hypotheses for the
treatment failure is the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in
tumor population. CSCs are pluripotent cells, which exhibit a high
level of drug resistance, metastatic, and self-renewal capabilities
as compared with normal cancer cells.7 Targeted
therapies against CSCs still remain a challenge. Conventional therapies
can effectively eradicate the rapidly proliferating cancer cell in
tumor but leaves the drug-resistant CSCs; the latter has the ability
to generate a pool of drug-resistant proliferating cells. Hence, a
rapid identification and targeted therapy against CSCs are required
to effectively treat cancer, but marker identification still poses
a challenge.

Even though several studies reported the carcinogenicity
of cadmium,
till date, no studies have reported the impact of cadmium on the CSC
marker expression. The present study addressed the role of cadmium
in the generation of CSCs in the tumor cell population. CSCs are generally
identified based on the expression of a unique set of markers; till
date, simultaneous identification of multiple markers with greater
accuracy remains a challenge. At present, serum marker analysis and
diagnostic enzyme analysis are widely used for the cancer diagnosis.
However, serum marker-based cancer diagnosis provides false positive
results.8 In addition, serum marker diagnosis
cannot provide details of the phenotype of cancer cells and CSCs.
Even though techniques such as immunohistochemistry and magnetic resonance
imaging enable the detection of CSCs,9 the
success of these techniques mostly relied on the expertise of the
physician. Deciphering the phenotype of CSCs is highly helpful for
the prognosis of cancer.10 However, successful
identification of the CSC phenotype depends on the accurate determination
of positiveness or negativeness of many biomarkers. Quantum dot (QD)-based
concurrent detection of multiple tumor markers is a suitable option
for the analysis of CSCs. QD exhibits broad excitation and narrow
emission spectra, which enables the concurrent monitoring of multiple
QDs through excitation at a single wavelength. In addition, QDs possess
strong photostability.11 These excellent
imaging properties of QDs are more suitable for multiplex imaging
of CSC markers. Moreover, the acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF)
used in the imaging device is an electronically tunable filter and
facilitates the scanning of QD-conjugated nanoprobes at a single wavelength,
which avoids the spectral overlap among the QDs. In this work, cadmium-induced
breast and hepatocellular CSCs were reported by concurrent determination
of molecular markers such as CD133, CD44, CD24, and aldehyde dehydrogenase1
(ALDH1). An AOTF and QD nanoprobe-based hypermulticolor cellular imaging
system was used for the identification of molecular markers. In addition,
the present high-content cellular assay devoid of cell lysis may provide
new insights into a mechanistic study on environmental carcinogen-induced
CSC formation, including cadmium dealt with in this work. The correlation
among proteins involved in signal transduction can be expected to
be observed at the single cell level without interruption arising
from cell lysis. In this work, the role of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
cascade in the cadmium-induced CSC markers was also analyzed.

Results
and Discussion
CSC Markers of Breast and Hepatic CSCs
CSCs are considered
to be responsible for the generation of highly proliferative bulk
tumor cell population.12 However, recently,
the differentiation of pancreatic cancer cells into CSCs has been
reported.13 Mutation, epigenetic changes,
and tumor microenvironment-induced alteration in the metabolism and
regulatory pathway are key factors for the generation of CSCs in the
tumor.14,15 Environmental pollutants could be one of
the causative factors for the generation of the CSCs. Earlier, Chang
et al. reported that sublethal stress induced by arsenic reprogrammed
the human bronchial epithelial cells to CD61– CSCs.16,17 Similarly, benzopyrene has been reported to enhance the stemness
property in MCF-7 cells.18,19 This indicates a possible
role of carcinogens in the expression of stemness genes in cancer.
In the present study, the effect of cadmium on the generation of CSCs
among bulk tumor cells of MCF-7 and HepG2 cells was studied. A schematic
illustration of the present study is represented in Figure 1. Identification of CSCs based
on the markers is a challenging task because the confirmation of CSCs
requires an analysis of expression of multiple stem-cell markers.
In breast cancer, CD44 and CD24 are the major stem-cell markers. It
has been reported that CD44+ CD24–/low CSC population can induce palpable tumors in nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immune deficiency mice with a 100-fold efficacy than CD44+ CD24+ cancer cells.20 Recently, ALDH1 has also been reported as an important breast CSC
marker. It has been evidenced that ALDH1+ CD44+ CD24–/low cells were highly tumorigenic than ALDH1– CD44+ CD24–/low cells.21 On the basis of the previous reports, cells
with the phenotype of ALDH1+ CD44+ CD24–/low are considered to be breast CSCs. Hepatic CSCs
can be identified with a number of markers, namely, CD44, CD24, CD133,
CD90, CD13, ALDH1, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM).22 CD133 was reported to be associated with invasive
features of breast, liver, brain, and lung cancer.23 CD44 has been proven, in many types of cancer, to facilitate
cell migration and promotes metastasis process.24 ALDH1 expression has been reported to enrich
the stamens property that provides chemo- and radioresistance characteristics
to CSCs.25,26 On the basis of the previous reports, HepG2
cells expressing CD133, CD44, and ALDH1 are considered to be hepatic
CSCs.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the monitoring of cadmium-induced CSCs
based on the concurrent identification of multiple CSC markers using
QD and AOTF-based cellular imaging. MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were treated
with cadmium for 72 h, followed by the separation of CSCs using a
magnetic sorter. Then, hepatic CSCs were identified based on the expression
of QD-conjugated CD133, CD44, and ALDH1, and breast CSCs were identified
based on the expression of CD44, CD24, and ALDH1. The AOTF scans the
cellular images at a single wavelength emitted from the QD-based nanoprobes
without spectral overlap.

High-Content Monitoring of CSC Population in Cultures Exposed
to Cadmium Using AOTF-Based Cellular Imaging
At present,
conventional methods such as western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,
and flow cytometry are used for the identification of stem-cell markers.
However, each of these techniques has its own merits and demerits.
Western blot involves cell lysis, separation of proteins in sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel, transfer of proteins into a membrane, and
a detection process; all of these processes need high technical expertise,
including proper maintenance of pH and temperature, buffer preparation,
and homogenization.27 Dye-labeled antibodies
used in immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses for the
detection of target proteins also have their own limitations. Most
of the dyes exhibit broad emission spectra,28 which considerably limits the concurrent probing of different CSC
markers. Simultaneous monitoring of multiple markers existing in a
single cell is highly advantageous because the stemness property of
CSCs is determined by the combination of the presence or absence of
many markers. Moreover, it has to be considered that the tumor population
is not a phenotypically homogeneous population.29 Even though fluorescence-activated cell sorting is a widely
used tool to monitor the molecular markers, concurrent analysis of
multiple CSC markers was hardly reported. In this work, for the successful
identification of multiple markers, QD-tagged antibodies and AOTF-based
cellular imaging was used. QDs have narrow spectral ranges; hence,
multiple QDs can be excited at a single wavelength. This phenomenon
enables the use of multiple QDs to obtain multicolor imaging for simultaneous
monitoring of multiple markers.30 QDs exhibit
multifold brightness, photostability, and photobleaching thresholds
as compared with the conventional dyes.31 Moreover, the AOTF filter used in the fluorescence microscopic detection
system is an electronically tunable spectral bandpass filter. AOTF
can produce beams at a single wavelength, and this property enables
the detection of multiple CSC markers without overlapping their emission
wavelength among each other. Hence, the combination of AOTF and QD-based
constructed detection system can provide the facility to concurrently
monitor more than four CSC markers at a single cell level.

In
the present study, HepG2 cells were treated with or without different
concentrations of cadmium for 72 h and then CSCs were isolated using
CD133 microbeads. To further confirm the sorted-out cells as CSCs,
the CD133 positive cells were immunostained with a mixture of QD-conjugated
CD133, CD44, and ALDH1 antibodies. As shown in Figure 2a, all of the isolated CD133 positive hepatic
CSCs were positive for both CD44 and ALDH1, which correlated well
with the phenotype of hepatocellular CSCs. Before the magnetic sorting
of CSCs, the total number of live HepG2 cells was counted using a
hemocytometer. Similarly, the total number of CD133 positive cells
obtained via the sorting was counted (Table 1). The line graph in Figure 2b represents the percentage of CSCs obtained
from HepG2 cells after treatment with cadmium: 4.76, 4.71, 6, 8.03,
and 8.78% of CSCs were observed at 0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM, and
1 μM cadmium, respectively. As compared with the control, cadmium-induced
CSCs were determined to be 1.24, 3.27, and 4.01%, respectively, at
100 nM, 500 nM, and 1 μM cadmium. A significant change was not
observed between the control and 10 nM concentration of cadmium. However,
a significant change was observed in cell cultures treated with a
high concentration of cadmium. In addition, the gene expression of
CSC markers CD133, CD44, and ALDH1 in HepG2 cells was analyzed with
the presence and absence of cadmium. Quantitative real-time (RT) polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) results displayed in Figure 2c show that cadmium significantly increased
the gene expression of CD133, CD44, and ALDH1 (p <
0.001, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively) in HepG2 cell lines. To confirm
the breast CSCs, antibodies that are specific for stem-cell markers
CD44, CD24, and ALDHI were conjugated with QD525, QD565, and QD605,
respectively.
All isolated CD44 positive breast CSCs are CD44 and ALDH1 positive
and CD24 negative (Figure 3a). A total number of MCF-7 cells used for the breast CSCs
were counted using a hemocytometer, and after sorting, isolated CSCs
were also counted (Table 2). The percentage of CSCs isolated from the MCF-7 cell culture
after treating with cadmium is represented in Figure 3b. The observed CSC percentages were 0.93,
0.97, 2.39, 3.50, and 4.73%, respectively, at 0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM,
500 nM and 1 μM cadmium. As compared with the control, the percentages
of cadmium-induced CSCs were 0.03, 1.42, 2.87, and 3.80%, respectively,
at 10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM, and 1 μM cadmium. To further confirm
the cadmium-induced gene expression of CSC markers, a semiquantitative
RT-PCR analysis was performed. RT-PCR results displayed in Figure 3c show that cadmium
significantly increased the gene expression of CD44 and ALDH1 (p < 0.01) in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. From
the observed results, we can conclude that the CSC population increased
in correlation with the concentration of cadmium exposure. Herein,
the results observed in the present study clearly indicated that cadmium
treatment significantly increased the number of CSC population in
the cultures of both breast and hepatic cancer cell lines. The AOTF-based
cellular imaging results observed in the present study show that all
isolated CSCs from MCF-7 cells were positive for CD44 and ALDH1 and
negative for CD24. Similarly, most of the CSCs isolated from the HepG2
cells were positive for CD133, CD44, and ALDH1 markers.

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Breast and Hepatic CSCs
The results observed in the multicolor cellular imaging analysis
were verified using flow cytometry. The flow cytometry method was
widely accepted for the detection of cellular markers. The CD44 and
CD133 markers were used for the identification of hepatic CSCs. Similarly,
CD44 and ALDH1 were used to monitor the breast CSC population existing
in the MCF-7 cell line. In Figure 4a–e, the x-axis represents
the fluorescence emission of CD44 and the y-axis
represents the fluorescence emission of CD133. Fluorescence observed
near the x-axis represents CD44 positive cells. Similarly,
fluorescence observed near the y-axis represents
CD133 positive cells. Cell population observed in the upper-right
section in the flow-cytometry results corresponds to CSCs, expressing
both CD44 and CD133 markers. A total of 30 000 HepG2 cells
were used for the flow cytometric analysis. The percentage of hepatocellular
CSCs was found to be 4.43, 4.66, 5.82, 7.96, and 8.91%, respectively,
at 0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM, and 1 μM cadmium (Figure 4a–e). These values were
plotted as a line graph in Figure 4f. Breast CSCs were also analyzed using FACS, and the
fluorescence emission of CD44 and ALDH1 was plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. As shown
in Figure 5a–e,
the upper-right section corresponds to the population of breast CSCs,
expressing both CD44 and ALDH1 markers. Flow cytometric measurements
were recorded for a total of 10 000 MCF-7 cells. The percentages
of CSCs found at 0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM, and 1 μM cadmium
treatment were 0.86, 0.99, 2.14, 3.79, and 4.61%, respectively. These
values were plotted as a line graph in Figure 5f.

High-Content Immunofluorescence and Western Blot Analysis of
Ras Signaling Cascade in Cadmium-Treated MCF-7 and HepG2 Cell Lines
Tumor initiation is a complex multistep process, which causes mutation
in a number of genes that are involved in cell regulation and proliferation.
It has been reported that a 6 h exposure of cadmium to the HepG2 cells
results in a vast change in the gene expression pattern.32,33 Epigenetic modifications are one of the major causes of mutation,
which involves acetylation of histones and methylation of genes, and
these modifications can alter gene expression. Cartularo et al., reported
that 1.0 μM cadmium chloride for 24 h or 0.1 μM cadmium
chloride for 3 weeks in HepG2 cells results in the methylation of
a number of genes that are involved in cell regulation.34 Earlier, it has been reported that cadmium uptake
in HepG2 cells significantly increased during the 24 h exposure period
and mostly accumulated in cytoplasm, nuclei, and mitochondria.35 The present study investigated the impact of
cadmium on the activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and
its role in the gene expression of CSC markers. The expression pattern
of p-Ras, p-Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK at a single cell level was simultaneously
analyzed using AOTF and respective QD-conjugated antibodies. Antip-Ras,
p-Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK antibodies were tagged with QD525, QD565,
QD605, and QD655, respectively. The MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were treated
with 1 μM cadmium for 72 h, and the fluorescence intensities
emitted from probes specific for p-Ras, p-Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK were
measured at 525, 565, 605, and 655 nm, respectively. The representative
images are depicted in Figures 6a and 7a. The observed fluorescence
intensities were quantitatively evaluated using the Metamorph software
and are represented in Figures 6b and 7b. The observed results show
that the active forms of p-Ras, p-Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK were significantly
(p < 0.001) increased in the cadmium-treated MCF-7
and HepG2 cells as compared with the control cells. Furthermore, to
confirm the immunofluorescence analysis, western blot analysis was
carried out; the obtained results show that the protein expressions
of p-Ras, p-Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK were increased as compared with
the control (Figures 6c and 7c).

and 655 nm, respectively. (b) Bar graph represents the quantitative

and unphosphorylated Ras, Raf-1, MEK-1, and ERK-1 in MCF-7 cells in

Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is mainly attributed to
the cell
survival and proliferation of cells. Ras is the upstream regulator
of this pathway, and several studies reported that the constitutive
activation of Ras due to mutation results in cancer.36 Ras signaling cascade was reported in the prevention of
apoptosis.37 Activation of the MAPK pathway
is closely related to the progression of metastasis of cancer. Extensive
preclinical data support that MEK inhibitor could be a potential anticancer
agent to treat human cancer.38 The inhibitory
potential of MEK inhibitor against apoptosis and cell proliferation
was reported in the HepG2 cell culture.39 The overexpression of Raf has been considered to be a prognostic
marker for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.40 Estrogen receptor-mediated Ras activation by
cadmium has been reported in the MCF-7 cell line.41 Interaction of cadmium with a G-protein-coupled estrogen
receptor and the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling cascade were reported
in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.42 In
the present study, elevated levels of phosphorylated Raf, MEK, and
ERK were observed in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells in response to the treatment
of cadmium. High-content multicolor imaging used in the current study
monitored the concurrent expression of MAPK components at the single
cell level; it clearly implicates the cadmium-induced activation of
MAPK pathway, and the study was further confirmed using western blot
analysis. Recent reports implicated
that an overexpression of various components of Ras pathway in CD44
positive cells,43 vice versa the inhibition
of Ras signaling, has been reported in the suppression of the stemness
property of CSCs.44

Ras Inhibitor Salirasib
Suppresses the Cadmium-Induced Gene
Expression of CD44, CD133, and ALDH1
To confirm the possible
involvement of Ras signaling cascade in the cadmium-induced CSC marker
expressions, HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 25 μM Ras
inhibitor salirasib (farnesylthiosalicylic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
and 1 μM cadmium for 72 h. As shown in Figure 8, the gene expressions of CD44, CD133, and
ALDH1 were not significantly changed in MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines
treated with salirasib alone as compared with the control. However,
in HepG2 cells, salirasib cotreatment with cadmium significantly suppressed
the cadmium-induced gene expression of CD44, CD133, and ALDH1 (p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.5, respectively). Similarly, salirasib
co-treatment with cadmium significantly suppressed the cadmium-induced
gene expression of CD44 and ALDH1 (p < 0.05) in
MCF-7 cells. The results of the present study show that elevated activation
of Ras signaling cascade in response to the cadmium-induced stress
plays a partial role in the expression of stemness genes in MCF-7
and HepG2 cells.

with 25 μM Ras inhibitor and 1 μM cadmium over the period
of 72 h. The mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. (a) mRNA expression
of CD44 and ALDH1 in MCF-7 cells. (b) mRNA expression of CD44, CD133,
and ALDH1 in HepG2 cells. Values are means ± SD from three independent
experiments.

From the results observed
in this study, it can be concluded that
the CSC population was significantly increased in MCF-7 and HepG2
cell lines in response to the cadmium treatment. In addition, cadmium
stimulates the gene expression of CSC markers CD44 and ALDH1 in MCF-7
cells and CD44, CD133, and ALDH1 in HepG2 cells through Ras signaling
cascade.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Cadmium
Treatment
Breast cancer cell
line MCF-7 and hepatic cell line HepG2 were purchased from the Korean
Cell Line Bank. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen, 11995-073) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (16000-044, Gibco), at
37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were treated
with different concentrations of cadmium, ranging from 10 nM to 1
μM (Sigma-Aldrich, 356107) for 72 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

Microbead-Based CSC Sorting from MCF-7 and HepG2 Cell Lines
The molecular marker-based magnetic cell sorting technique was
used to isolate the CSCs. Magnetic beads conjugated with anti-CD44
antibody were used to separate the breast CSCs from MCF-7 cell lines.
Similarly, magnetic beads conjugated with anti-CD133 were used to
separate the hepatic CSCs from HepG2 cell lines. Briefly, after treating
with cadmium for 72 h, the cell cultures were washed twice with 1×
PBS and incubated with Accutase solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) for 20 min for the detachment of cells from the culture plate.
The detached cells were centrifuged briefly at 1250 rcf for 5 min.
Then, the cell pellet was briefly resuspended in sorting buffer and
then centrifuged at 300g for 10 min. The collected
MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were incubated with 20 μL of CD44 and
20 μL of CD133 microbead solution, respectively, for 15 min
at 4 °C (CD44 microbead kit human and CD133 microbead kit human,
MACS Miltenyi Biotec). The cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of
sorting buffer and centrifuged at 300g for 10 min.
The obtained cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of sorting
buffer. The LS column provided in the kit was (130-042-401; MACS Miltenyi
Biotec) fixed in the magnetic field of MACS separator, and then preseparation
filter (130-041-407; MACS Miltenyi Biotec) was kept on the LS column.
The filter and column setup was rinsed thoroughly using sorting buffer,
and then the resuspended cells were applied on the preseparation filter.
CD44/CD133 negative cells were eluted using sorting buffer. To elute
the attached CD44 positive and CD133 positive cells from the column,
the column was kept on a collecting tube and rinsed thoroughly using
5 mL of sorting buffer. The collected CD44 positive fraction of MCF-7
cells, and the CD133 positive fraction of HepG2 cells were used for
further analysis.

Preparation of Antibody–QD Conjugates
for CSC Screening
Antibodies specific for CSC markers CD133
(ab-19898; Abcam, USA),
CD44 (sc-65265), CD24 (sc-19585), and ALDH1 (sc-374149) (Santa Cruz
biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA) were conjugated to QD705, QD525, QD565,
and QD625, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Quantum Dot Conjugation Kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Disulfide
bonds in the antibodies were reduced by dithiothreitol and then incubated
with maleimide-functionalized QD for 1 h at room temperature. The
maleimide group in the QD–antibody conjugates was removed by
treating with 2-mercaptoethanol. The unconjugated QDs were eluted
using a column provided in the kit. The QD–antibody conjugate
solution was diluted at 1:200 with 1% bovine serum albumin. The cancer
cells isolated from the magnetic bead-sorting procedure were fixed
in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and then washed twice with 1× PBS.
The formaldehyde-fixed cells were centrifuged at 230g for 3 min, and the cell pellet was collected. The collected cell
pellet was treated with 0.2% saponin for 10 min at room temperature
and then washed twice with 1× PBS. The cells processed using
the above-mentioned steps were incubated with the diluted QD–antibody
conjugates for 2 h at room temperature. The following mixture of antibody–QD
conjugates containing QD605–ALDH1, QD655–CD133, and
QD705–CD44 was used for the HepG2 cells, and a mixture of antibody–QD
conjugates containing QD525–CD44, QD565–CD24, and QD605–ALDH1
was used for the MCF-7 cells. After incubation, the cells were washed
twice with 1× PBS and centrifuged at 230g for
3 min. The obtained cell pellet was resuspended again in 50 μL
of 1× PBS solution, and 10 μL of cells was placed in the
1.5 μ slide vi for imaging (1.5 μ-slide vi; ibide GmbH,
Am Klopferspitz, 82152 Martinsried, Germany). The antibody–QD
conjugates QD525–CD44, QD565–CD24, QD605–ALDH1,
QD655–CD133, and QD705–CD44 were scanned at 705, 525,
565, and 625 nm, respectively, using an AOTF-enabled detection system.

Flow Cytometry
CD44 and CD133 antibody–QD conjugates
were used to detect hepatocellular CSCs. Similarly, CD44 and ALDH1
antibody–QD conjugates were used to detect the CSCs of MCF-7
cell lines. Briefly, the MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were treated with different
concentrations of cadmium (10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM, and 1 μM)
for 72 h. Then, the cells were detached from the culture flask using
the cell detachment solution Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
for 20 min at 37 °C. The detached cells were treated with 4%
formaldehyde and then incubated with 0.2% saponin for 10 min at room
temperature. The cells were then treated with QD-conjugated antibodies
for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the cells were washed
with phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) solution and centrifuged at 230g for 3 min. The obtained cell pellet was resuspended in
2 mL of 1× PBS solution, and then the cells were subjected to
the flow cytometric analysis using an FACS Calibur (FACS Calibur;
BD Bioscience).

High-Content Screening of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
Pathway
For
the simultaneous quantitative expression of Ras signaling cascade,
antibodies specific for p-Ras (sc-130215), p-Raf-1 (sc-101791), p-MEK-1
(sc-271914), and p-ERK (sc-7383) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) were
conjugated with QD525, QD565, QD625, and QD655, respectively. The
MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were treated with 1 μM cadmium for 72
h. After treating with cadmium, the cells were washed twice with 1×
PBS and then fixed using 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.
Then, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.2% saponin
for 10 min at room temperature. After that, the cells were washed
thrice with PBS and incubated with QD-conjugated antibodies for 2
h at room temperature. After washing thrice with PBS buffer, the cells
were scanned at 525, 565, 625, and 655 nm using an AOTF-based detection
system.

Western Blot
The cadmium-induced activation of phosphorylated
and unphosphorylated forms of Ras (sc-224), Raf-1 (sc-7267), MEK-1
(sc-6250), and ERK-1 (sc-94) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) in MCF-7
and HepG2 cells was analyzed using the western blot. The MCF-7 and
HepG2 cells were treated with 1 μM cadmium for 72 h. After the
cadmium treatment, cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (RIPA Buffer; R0278, Sigma-Aldrich). The protein concentration
of cell lysates was quantified using Bradford protein assay (BioRod,
USA). Thirty micrograms of homogenized protein samples was separated
using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to
the nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma, USA). Then, the membranes were
probed with primary antibodies. Reactive proteins were detected using
horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA) and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection
(Amersham). The images were taken using LAS4000 (Image Quant LAS4000;
GE Healthcare).

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA from
the cadmium-treated
MCF-7 and HepG2 cells was extracted, as described by the manufacturer’s
protocol (Dynabeads MRNA Purification Kit, Invitrogen, USA). The quality
of isolated RNA was assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 260:280
nm and then by 1% agarose RNA gel electrophoresis. The concentration
of RNA was measured at 260 nm using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific,
USA). From the total RNA, cDNAs specific for GAPDH, CD44, CD133, and
ALDH1 were prepared using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen,
USA), as described by the manufacturer’s protocol. Two picomoles
of primers was used for the amplification of target m-RNA. The starting
template quantity of the samples was determined using GAPDH expression,
and then quantitative PCRs were carried out. The following primers
were used: CD44 sense TGCCGCTTTGCAGGTGTATT, antisense CCGATGCTCAGAGCTTTCTCC;
Cd133 sense GCATTGGCATCTTCTATGGTT, antisense CGCCTTGTCCTTGGTAGTGT;
ALDH1 sense CCTGTCCTACTCACCGATTTG, antisense TCCTCCTTATCTCCTTCTTCTACC;
and GAPDH sense CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCCT, antisense AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT.
A SYBR green method was adopted to perform the RT-PCR (SYBR green
qPCR kit, Thermo Scientific, USA). An RT-PCR instrument (7300, Applied
Biosystems) was used to execute the RT-PCR. Data were normalized with
GAPDH and analyzed using the 2–ΔΔCT method.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were performed
in triplicates (n = 3). The data were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance with
a Tukey–Kramer post-test was used to compare the data between
groups. The results obtained in the present study were considered
to be statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05.
