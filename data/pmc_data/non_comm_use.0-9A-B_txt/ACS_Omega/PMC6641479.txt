To reduce the amount of organic solvents
in pendimethalin emulsifiable
concentrate (EC), small-size microcapsules (S-MCs) and large-size
microcapsules (L-MCs) were prepared with polyurea as a wall material.
Petri-dish bioassays were carried out to investigate the bioactivity
of formulations and the influence of both organic matter and moisture.
The relationships between degradation and the biological activity
of three pendimethalin formulations in the soil were investigated,
and field experiments were executed to verify the laboratory results.
The laboratory tests showed the following: (1) the bioactivity of
EC and S-MCs was similar and greater than that of L-MCs; (2) organic
matter could reduce the bioactivity of MCs and EC, and the impact
of organic matter on L-MCs was greater; (3) increased soil moisture
content had no significant effect on the bioactivity of EC but slightly
reduced that of the MCs; and (4) the L-MCs showed significantly more
prolonged residual and effective persistence in the soil than did
EC and S-MCs. However, the field experiments indicated that the herbicidal
efficacies of L-MCs at the early and late stages were both lower than
those of EC. Comprehensive analysis of the results indicated that
the main reason that the herbicidal efficacy of L-MCs was lower than
that of EC in the field was that L-MCs missed the optimal herbicidal
periods due to the slow-release characteristics of L-MCs. The S-MCs
had both similar release rates and herbicidal efficacy in the field
as EC. Therefore, to develop a good pesticide formulation, the occurrence
and damage characteristic of pests must be considered.

Introduction
Encapsulation technology
has been widely used in the field of agrochemicals,
as encapsulation can reduce the volatilization and degradation of
the active ingredient to prolong its persistence.1−4 To date, more than 150 kinds of
pesticide microcapsules (MCs) have been registered in China, including
insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators.
The advancements of pesticide MCs in China also stem from the limitations
of using organic solvents in pesticide emulsifiable concentrate (EC),
which was officially issued in the Limit of Harmful Solvents
of Emulsifiable Concentrate Pesticides.5 Petroleum derivatives, such as benzene, toluene, xylene,
and N,N-dimethylformamide, are widely
used as solvents for the production of EC. However, these solvents
are not biodegradable and can be hazardous to the environment.6 The development of water-based formulations is
one of the most significant developments for EC. Among the extensive
developments, capsule suspension is a promising orientation that accommodates
the encapsulated pesticide in water.7−9

Pendimethalin (N-(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitrobenzenamine; Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information) is a
dinitroaniline primarily preemergent herbicide; pendimethalin is one
of the top herbicides and can control various annual grasses and certain
broadleaf weeds in a variety of crops. At present, the dominant formulation
for pendimethalin is still an EC. Thus, the development of water-based
formulations for pendimethalin is helpful to reduce the consumption
of organic solvents and pollution to the environment.10 However, pendimethalin preparations of emulsion oil in
water and suspension concentrates can easily lead to technical material
crystal Ostwald ripening, which can cause formulation instability.
Therefore, microencapsulation is an alternative formulation for pendimethalin
in terms of environmental considerations.

Mogul et al. suggested
that the efficacy of a controlled release
system is the most important indicator when evaluating pesticide products.1 Studies have reported that microencapsulation
can increase or reduce pesticide biological activity.11−15 Studies have reported that the conventional EC of alachlor shows
quicker bioavailability16,17 but shorter residual
activity than encapsulated alachlor.18,19 Furthermore,
Hatzinikolaou et al.20 indicated that the
bioactivity of pendimethalin EC in the soil was greater than that
of pendimethalin MCs, but the authors did not reveal the reasons for
this result. Unfortunately, none of the above studies indicated the
type of capsule wall material used. Wall material is a key factor
that influences the release characteristics and mechanical strength
of MCs.21,22 When the wall material differs, the biological
activity of the pesticide MCs will especially vary.23,24 Therefore, the kinds of wall materials used should be specified
in research involving the biological activity of pesticide MCs. In
addition, a decrease in MC particle size can lead to increases in
the total surface area of MCs, thus accelerating the release of the
encapsulated ingredient(s). In addition, the impact of pesticide particle
size on efficacy has generated concern among researchers.25−27 Therefore, this study examined the effect of particle size on the
efficacy of pendimethalin MCs.

At present, interfacial polymerization
is the most commonly used
method in the preparation of pesticide MCs.28,29 In the present study, small-size microcapsules (S-MCs) and large-size
microcapsules (L-MCs) fabricated with polyurea wall material were
obtained using an interfacial polymerization method (Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information). A series of laboratory
tests and field experiments were carried out to reveal the cause of
the pendimethalin herbicidal activity reduction after encapsulation
in polyurea and to explore the method of improving the herbicidal
activity.

Results and Discussion
Microcapsule Characterization
Figure 1a,d,g illustrates
the dispersed states of
pendimethalin EC, S-MCs, and L-MCs in water. Particles of the three
samples exhibited favorable dispersibility, and the size distributions
were unimodal (Figure 1c). The D10, D50, and D90 of the L-MCs were 2.63, 10.35,
and 23.12 μm, respectively; those of the S-MCs were 0.98, 1.32,
and 1.73 μm, respectively; and those of the EC were 0.38, 0.45,
and 0.50 μm, respectively.

formulations: photomicrographs
of (a) EC, (d) S-MCs, and (g) L-MCs dispersed in water; (c) particle
size distribution; photomicrographs of naturally dried states of (b)
EC, (e) S-MCs, and (h) L-MCs on a glass slide; scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of (f) S-MCs and (i) L-MCs (magnified 13 000×
and 400×; acceleration voltage of 3.0 kV).

After the pendimethalin EC dilution was air-dried, rod- or
sheetlike
crystals emerged with the volatilization of water and the solvent
(Figure 1b). The crystals
undoubtedly were the technical material of pendimethalin. It was clear
that all of the pendimethalin maintained a bare state. However, MCs
exhibited rather different stabilities even after being air-dried.
As depicted in Figure 1e,h, the MCs appeared to be stable spheres, which was further confirmed
by SEM. It was apparent from the SEM images that the membrane of the
MCs was nonporous and that the surface was relatively smooth with
several dents (Figure 1f,i). However, the subsidence of S-MCs was more severe. Regarding
the MCs containing pendimethalin, the vast majority of active ingredient
was encapsulated in the polymeric shell. We were interested in to
what extent the technical material of pendimethalin was encapsulated,
although no apparent crystals were observed. Therefore, the contents
of free pendimethalin in the L-MC and S-MC suspensions were measured,
which were 2.30 and 2.9%, and they increased to 2.84 and 3.3%, respectively,
after storage at 54 °C for 14 days. This indicates that pendimethalin
cannot easily be released when the MCs are suspended in water, as
the solubility of pendimethalin in water is only 0.33 mg/L at 20 °C.

The results showed that the biological activity of pendimethalin
MCs mainly depends on the active ingredient released from the capsule
core. Thus, it was necessary to investigate the release characteristics
of the MCs. The results are shown in Figure 2. The release characteristics of the three
samples were largely different. After the EC sample was added to the
release medium, pendimethalin quickly became evenly distributed, whereas
the MCs showed clearly sustained release characteristics. After 2
h, the release volume of the S-MCs reached 90%, and the slow-release
phase then began. After 5 h, the release volume of the S-MCs reached
100%. The release of L-MCs was significantly slower than that of S-MCs,
and the release time of L-MCs was longer than that of S-MCs by approximately
5 h.

Figure 2 Release properties of the pendimethalin formulations.

Moreover, MCs have significant advantages considering
the financial
and environmental costs, as they contain 10% solvent, whereas the
EC contains 60% solvent. Therefore, the wide application of MCs can
substantially lessen the consumption of organic solvents.

Pure Inhibitory
Activity of Pendimethalin MCs and EC against
the Root Growth of Sorghum
The results of the inhibition
of MCs and EC to sorghum root growth are shown in Figure 3. The inhibition of EC and
S-MCs was similar and greater than that of L-MCs at the same concentration.
When the concentration increased from 0.25 to 4 mg kg–1, the EC group inhibition rate ranged from 59.26 to 86.46%, that
of the S-MC group ranged from 53.64 to 85.33%, and that of the L-MC
group ranged from 30.49 to 81.87%. This phenomenon could mostly be
due to the active ingredient release mechanism. When the EC was applied
into sand, the pendimethalin was completely exposed (as shown in Figure 1b). However, the
polyurea wall of the MCs was very stable and never broke during application28 (as shown in Figure 1e,h). Therefore, the pendimethalin must gradually
be released by slow osmosis. More biologically available pendimethalin
was initially present where EC had been applied, compared with MCs.
In addition, the inhibition of S-MCs was higher than that of L-MCs.
This may have been because the larger surface area of the S-MCs was
conducive to the release of pendimethalin. This result demonstrated
that microencapsulation can reduce pendimethalin bioactivity, and
adjusting the particle size can regulate the biological activity of
pendimethalin MCs.

root growth
of sorghum. Data with different lowercase letters are significantly
different at the p < 0.05 level by Tukey’s
multiple-range test. Error bars represent the standard errors of the
means of four replicates.

Influence of Soil Conditions on the Biological Activity
The biological activity of preemergence herbicides largely depends
on dynamic field conditions, such as rainfall intensity, organic matter
(OM), and soil moisture content.18 Therefore,
it is crucial to clarify the influence of soil conditions on the biological
activity of preemergence herbicides.

Effect of Organic Matter
(OM) on the Inhibitory Activity of
Pendimethalin MCs and EC against the Root Growth of Sorghum
As depicted in Figure 4, the inhibition of pendimethalin EC and MCs gradually decreased
with increasing amounts of OM. More importantly, the decreased levels
of pendimethalin L-MCs were more significant than when using the S-MC
and EC treatments. When the content of OM increased from 0 to 8%,
the inhibition rate of the L-MC group decreased by 42.7%, that of
the S-MC group decreased by 21.38%, and that of the EC group decreased
by only 10.58%. There are two possible reasons for this result. First,
the pores in the surface of peat,30 which
is the main component of OM, can adsorb the pendimethalin,31,32 thus reducing contact between the seed and pendimethalin. In the
treatment of L-MCs, the insufficient biologically active pendimethalin
becomes scarcer after being absorbed by OM. Second, the presence of
OM promoted root growth. In the treatment without herbicides, the
sorghum root length increased gradually with increased OM content
(Figure 4A), as OM
can both provide nutrients and loosen the growth matrix.

Figure 4 Effect of organic
matter content on the inhibitory activity of
pendimethalin MCs and EC against the root length of sorghum. (A) Root
length. (B) Inhibition rate. Data with different lowercase letters
are significantly different at the p < 0.05 level
by Tukey’s multiple-range test. Error bars represent the standard
error of the mean of four replicates.

Effect of Absolute Moisture Content (AMC) on the Inhibitory
Activity of Pendimethalin MCs and EC against the Root Growth of Sorghum
As shown in Figure 5A, the AMC had a slight influence on root length with the treatment
of pendimethalin EC or MCs, although no significant differences were
observed. However, AMC had a relatively larger influence on the bioactivity
of L-MCs and S-MCs. Pendimethalin in the EC-treated group was uniformly
dispersed and exposed in the sand, and the roots were then completely
exposed to pendimethalin. Therefore, AMC only showed a slight influence
on the root growth of sorghum after treatment with EC, as the dose
of the dissociative active ingredient did not vary with the variation
of AMC. However, when pendimethalin was encapsulated into the polyurea
wall material, it did not show bioactivity unless the active ingredient
was released from the MCs. Nevertheless, it was difficult for pendimethalin
to be released when the MCs were suspended in water (the effect of
the particle range of MCs on the release of pendimethalin was not
obvious), which is due to the low water solubility of pendimethalin.
This conclusion was confirmed by the results of free pendimethalin
in the MC formulations (Microcapsule Characterization). Thus, the increase in moisture is unfavorable for the release
of pendimethalin from MCs. As shown in Figure 5B, the fluctuating inhibition rate was more
apparent because the root length of sorghum decreased in the control
group containing higher amounts of AMC (may have been due to the anaerobic
respiration of the root system). Nevertheless, when the AMC in the
sand reached 15%, the system was saturated. As the AMC continued to
increase, the root length and inhibition rate in the various treatment
groups remained unchanged.

was 1 mg a.i. kg–1 of air-dried soil. Data with

Relationship between the
Residues and Biological Activity of
Pendimethalin MCs and EC
As has been reported, it was difficult
for pendimethalin to volatilize and leach. Its dissipation in the
soil mainly depends on microbial decomposition.33−35 Therefore,
we measured the degradation of pendimethalin in unpasteurized soil
treated with MCs and EC and simultaneously demonstrated their bioactivity.

To determinate the percent recovery of pendimethalin in the soil,
100 g of soil sample was fortified with 0.01–1.25 μg
g–1 of pendimethalin EC or MCs, as shown in Table S1. The percent recoveries of pendimethalin
from the soil fortified with EC, S-MCs, and L-MCs at concentrations
of 0.01–1.25 μg g–1 ranging from 79.8
to 86.4%, 80.4 to 85.9%, and 75.9 to 85.1%, respectively, with the
standard errors (SEs) less than 2.7, 4.2, and 2.5, respectively. These
data suggest that the proposed extraction method was satisfactory
for extracting pendimethalin from the soil (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 6A shows
the residual amount of pendimethalin in the soil treated with S-MCs,
L-MCs, and EC. The theoretical concentration of pendimethalin in the
20 g of soil sample was 1000 μg kg–1. Twenty
days after treatment, 413.73 μg kg–1 of pendimethalin
remained in the EC-treated soil; 505.74 and 833.74 μg kg–1 of pendimethalin remained in the S-MC- and L-MC-treated
soils, respectively. The degradation rates of pendimethalin from the
EC and S-MCs were similar and faster than that of L-MCs at the same
concentration. One hundred days after treatment, the residual of the
EC group decreased to 6.97 μg kg–1, whereas
those of the S-MC and L-MC groups were approximately 56.57 and 260.35
μg kg–1, respectively.

Figure 6 Residual amount of pendimethalin
in the soil (A) treated with MCs
and EC and the inhibitory activity of residual pendimethalin in the
soil against the root growth of sorghum (B). Error bars represent
the standard errors of the means of four replicates.

A cubic polynomial fit well with the L-MC (y =
911.37 – 4.5644x – 0.0112x2 – 8.1013 × 10–5x3, R = 0.9962) dissipation
points, whereas an exponential function was a more appropriate fit
for the EC (y = 923.12 e–0.0454x, R = 0.9930, with a half-life of
14.76 days) dissipation points. Thus, the EC degradation curve essentially
conformed to a first-order kinetics model, whereas the L-MC curves
did not fit a first-order model. Chen et al.36 and Zhang et al.24 showed that when pesticides
are incorporated into EC, they rapidly dissipate and fit with a first-order
kinetics equation; after the pesticide was encapsulated, the degradation
curve did not fit a first-order kinetics equation. This result is
consistent with ours. Unlike previous findings, an exponential function
was a more appropriate fit for the S-MC (y = 28.77+
864.33 e0.0306x, R = 0.9983) dissipation points. This result may still depend on the
rapid release of S-MCs.

To demonstrate the bioactivity of residual
pendimethalin, the soil
samples treated with S-MCs, L-MCs, or EC were tested for the inhibition
of sorghum root growth at different time intervals (Figure 6B). Within the first day, the
inhibition rate gap between EC and L-MCs was 19% in the soil, whereas
this gap was approximately 14% in the sand (Pure
Inhibitory Activity of Pendimethalin MCs and EC against the Root Growth
of Sorghum). These results indicate that the bioactivity of
MCs was lower in the soil. The inhibition rates of the EC and S-MCs
were similar. Within the first 20 days, the inhibition of both types
of MCs was lower than that of the EC. However, the inhibition rate
of the EC treatment sharply decreased, whereas that of the MCs gradually
decreased. After 40 days, the inhibition of both kinds of MCs was
higher than that of the EC. After 100 days, the inhibition rate of
the EC group decreased to 0%, whereas that of the S-MCs was approximately
8% and that of the L-MCs was approximately 26%.

Field Experiments
The efficacies of pendimethalin EC
and MCs in controlling different kinds of weeds were investigated
in field experiments, and the results are shown in Figure 7. Three weeks after treatment,
when the herbicide dose was the same, the numbers of Gramineae, Cyperaceae,
and Portulacaceae of EC- and S-MC-treated plots were less than those
of the L-MC-treated plots. Six and ten weeks after treatment, the
tendency of grass numbers and total plant control efficacy in all
herbicide treatments were similar compared with those at 3 weeks.
Ten weeks after treatment, the total fresh weight control efficacy
against Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and Portulacaceae of the EC and S-MC
1500 g a.i. ha–1 groups was approximately 75% of
that of the control, and the total fresh weight control efficacies
of other treatments were approximately 45–60%. It is worth
noting that the control efficacy of the L-MCs was lower than that
of the EC in the early and late stages of the field experiment. These
results are not in accordance with those of the laboratory tests.

The same experiment was repeated in Tai’an, China, in 2016
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).
The results were similar to those shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Efficacies of pendimethalin EC and MCs in controlling
different
kinds of weeds in field experiments. Data with different lowercase
letters are significantly different at the p <
0.05 level by Tukey’s multiple-range test. Error bars represent
the standard errors of the means of four replicates.

Efficacy must be considered in the development
of pesticide preparations.
The following two reasons were responsible for the lower herbicidal
activity of L-MCs compared with that of EC in the early stage of the
field experiment.

First, the reduced biological activity was
due to the hardened
polyurea capsule wall blocking the release of pendimethalin. This
conclusion was confirmed by microscopy and biological activity tests.

Second, the influence of the OM and water on the soil played a
role. In farmland, OM consists of residual weeds, crop straw, and
decaying farmyard manure. OM is an important component in the soil
and can provide nutrients and improve the porosity of the soil. Moreover,
the OM content also influences the adsorption of herbicides in the
soil; thus, its herbicidal activity is significantly influenced. Soni
et al.32 indicated that the presence of
OM in the soil can reduce the bioactivity of pendimethalin EC. Our
research found that the reduced bioactivity of pendimethalin MCs by
OM was more apparent, when compared with EC, and that the impact of
L-MCs was greater than that of the other two formulations. Interestingly,
the influence of OM on different herbicides was different. Vasilakoglou
et al.16 found that OM could significantly
reduce the bioactivity of alachlor MCs more than that of alachlor
EC, but the influence of OM on acetochlor MCs and acetochlor EC was
not significantly different. This may have been related to both the
adsorption ability of OM to the compound and the mobility of the compound
in the soil. Furthermore, irrigation before or after spraying preemergence
herbicides is a typical farm operation. Therefore, investigation of
the influence of soil humidity on herbicide bioactivity has great
practical significance. The results showed that the soil humidity
has little effect on the biological activity of pendimethalin MCs
and EC.

The persistence experiment in the laboratory showed
that (i) microencapsulation
by polyurea can reduce the degradation of pendimethalin in the soil,
particularly for L-MCs, and that (ii) as time progresses, pendimethalin
in the microcapsules can be released to exert its biological activity.
Nevertheless, at the late stages of the field experiments, the efficacies
of L-MCs in controlling weeds were still lower than that of the EC.

Our results contradict those reported by Hatzinikolaou et al.,20 who found that the field persistence of pendimethalin
MCs was slightly longer than that for EC. However, this conclusion
does not represent the actual field effect because the field persistence
of the herbicide was studied with the Petri-dish bioassays that were
carried out after the soil herbicide treatment was taken back to the
laboratory.

To explain the opposite results between the laboratory
and field
experiments, the biological characteristics of control objects should
be analyzed. Yang et al.13 and Yuan et
al.15 showed that microencapsulated insecticides
were significantly more stable against degradation in the soil and
had much greater efficacies against white grubs than the conventional
formulation, as microencapsulation increased the chance of exposure
of insects to insecticides. However, we should note that the control
targets of preemergence herbicides are newly germinated seed. Figure 8 can be used to understand
the reason for the efficacy differences caused by seed depth between
pendimethalin MCs and EC in the field. The germination of seeds is
closely related to the depth of the seed. The appropriate soil layer
is beneficial to the seed to germinate, whereas the deeper soil layers
are adverse to seed germination.37−39 In the field experiment,
the number of weeds in the control area gradually decreased, which
indicated that no or very few new weeds grew. In addition, preemergence
herbicides cannot kill weeds that have penetrated the soil surface.40 As such, extending the period of preemergence
herbicides is not needed. Therefore, it is very important to control
weeds at early stages for preemergence herbicides. In other words,
the herbicidal efficacy of L-MCs was lower than that of EC because
the slow-release characteristics caused L-MCs to miss the critical
period of seed germination.

Figure 8 Schemes explaining the efficacy differences
caused by seed depth
between pendimethalin MCs and EC in the field.

There are three strategies for improving the weeding efficacy
of
pendimethalin MCs. First, we can regulate the construction of polyurea.
For example, previous studies have shown that assembling photosensitive41,42 acidic groups, alkali-sensitive groups,43 or temperature-sensitive groups44 onto
the capsule wall material can regulate the release of the core. Second,
we can choose other special microcapsule membranes that will rupture
as a chemical response to an applied stimulus, e.g., water23 and temperature.45 Third, we can adjust the biological activity of pesticide microcapsules
by changing the size of the microcapsules.46 This study adopted the third method to improve the bioactivity of
pendimethalin MCs. The results showed that when the particle size
range was 0.1–2 μm, the herbicidal activity of pendimethalin
MCs in the laboratory and field was analogous to that of EC.

This study revealed the reasons for the poor weed control effect
of pendimethalin MCs and the increased herbicidal activity of pendimethalin
MCs with the polyurea wall material by reducing the particle size.
Importantly, the development of pesticide formulations must account
for the biological characteristics of the control object. Our results
can simultaneously provide a reference for the microencapsulation
of pesticide compounds. In addition, whether the impact of particle
size on bioactivity is suitable for other pesticides or microcapsule
wall materials needs further study.

Conclusions
In
the present study, to reduce the use of organic solvents in
pendimethalin formulations, pendimethalin MCs with polyurea as the
wall material were prepared using interfacial polymerization. The
laboratory tests obtained the following results: (i) the influence
of OM on the bioactivity of MCs was greater than that of EC; (ii)
the effects of soil moisture on the efficacy were minor, but excessive
moisture was unfavorable for the release of pendimethalin from MCs;
(iii) although L-MCs were more stable in the soil and exhibited biological
activity, the slow-release properties of L-MCs caused pendimethalin
to miss the critical period of weed germination; and (iv) the bioactivity
and field efficiency of S-MCs and EC were similar and greater than
those of L-MCs. These results show that in the development of the
MC formulations of preemergence herbicides, developers should pay attention to the quick release
of the capsule core. In summary, it is necessary to consider the occurrence
and damage rules of pests during the development of pesticide formulations.

Preparation of Formulations
Microencapsulation
procedure. Polyurea L-MCs were obtained using an interfacial
polymerization method.47 In the first step,
30.93 g of pendimethalin, 10.00 g of xylene, and 2.5 g of MDI were
weighed and mixed, which constituted the organic phase. Then, an O/W
emulsion was prepared by pouring the organic phase into 60 g of aqueous
solution containing 1.5% EL-40 and 0.1% PVA as a stabilizer. After
homogenizing the mixture at 8000 rpm for 2 min at room temperature,
the oil in water emulsion was then transferred to a three-neck flask
and stirred at 300 rpm. Next, 5.5 g of HDA solution (10%, w/w) was
added in dropwise increments. The reaction was carried out at 60 °C
for 3 h at a stirring rate of 300 rpm. The preparation process of
S-MCs was the same as that for L-MCs except for increasing the dosage
of EL-40 from 1.5 to 5.5%.

The microcapsule slurry was centrifuged
at 1 × 104 rpm. The microcapsule suspension formulation
was prepared by resuspending the sedimented material in an aqueous
solution containing 4 g of emulsifier 500# and 6 g of emulsifier
600#. The final volume of the solution was brought to 100
mL with water. The concentration of pendimethalin in this microencapsulated
formulation was 300 g L–1.

Preparation
of pendimethalin EC. The conventional
formulation was prepared by mixing 30.93 g of pendimethalin technical
material, 4 g of emulsifier 500#, and 6 g of emulsifier
600#. The final volume of the solution was brought 100
mL with xylene.

Characterization
The particle size
and size distribution
of the MCs were measured with a laser particle size analyzer (LS-POP
6; Omec Instruments Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China). The surface morphology
of the MCs was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi
SU8010, Tokyo, Japan). Photomicrographs were obtained using a BX51
microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

ingredients of both MC preparations and the preparation samples after
14 days at 54 °C were tested according to previous methods, with
modifications.29,48 The release properties of the
three pendimethalin preparations were examined according to previous
methods, with modifications.4 The standard
procedures used are described in the Supporting Information.

Bioactivity of Pendimethalin EC and MCs
Petri-dish
bioassays were carried out based on the method of Hatzinikolaou et
al.20 to compare the root growth of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench in sand after treatment
with pendimethalin EC, S-MCs, or L-MCs. Pendimethalin EC, S-MCs, and
L-MCs were dissolved in deionized water and added to their respective
sand samples. Then, the mixtures were thoroughly mixed by shaking
to achieve the concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg a.i. kg–1 of air-dried sand and an absolute water content of
13.5%. Untreated sand received the same amount of deionized water
and was regarded as the control. The mixtures were maintained for
24 h to equilibrate and were mixed again before use in the tests.
The treated sand–diluent mixture (87 g) was then added to the
bottoms of 7.5 cm diameter Petri dishes, and a groove was carved out
at the sand surface using a glass rod. Twelve viable sorghum (Hercules
Sweet variety) seeds were then placed in the groove. Then, the Petri
dishes were canopied with another 7.5 cm diameter Petri dish and sealed
to retain moisture. The Petri dishes were then placed in an incubator
in a randomized block design at 25 ± 1 °C and covered with
linen lining to exclude light for 4 days. At the end of the incubation
period, the plants were removed from the Petri dishes and carefully
washed until free of the sand. The average root length of 10 randomly
selected seedlings was measured, omitting any small laterals, to the
nearest 1 mm. To enhance the experimental precision, each treatment
concentration was performed in quadruplicate.

Influence of OM on the
Bioactivity of Pendimethalin EC and MCs
A laboratory experiment
was conducted to evaluate the influence
of different levels of OM (a brand of Pindstrup, Denmark) on the bioactivity
of pendimethalin EC, S-MCs, and L-MCs. The sand samples were thoroughly
mixed with different quantities of OM to achieve mixtures containing
0, 1, 2, 4, and 8% OM. Subsequently, these mixtures were further mixed
with appropriate quantities of EC, S-MC, or L-MC diluents. The following
procedures were consistent with those in the section title “Bioactivity of Pendimethalin EC and MCs”,
except that only one concentration of each preparation (1 mg a.i.
kg–1 of air-dried sand) was used to determine the
influence of OM.

Influence of AMC on the Bioactivity of Pendimethalin
EC and
MCs
Experiments to evaluate the influence of different levels
of moisture on the bioactivity of pendimethalin EC, S-MCs, and L-MCs
were also carried out under laboratory conditions. The sand samples
were thoroughly mixed with different quantities of herbicide diluent
to achieve mixtures containing 12, 13.5, 15, 16.5, and 18% AMC and
only one concentration (1 mg a.i. kg–1 of air-dried
sand) of each preparation. The following procedures were consistent
with those in the section titled “Bioactivity
of Pendimethalin EC and MCs”.

Dynamic Changes of Residues
and Bioactivity of Herbicides in
the Soil
Fresh surface soil (depth of 0–10 cm) was
collected from the experimental farm of Shandong Agricultural University,
China. The soil sample was air-dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve.
The soil samples were placed in a glass container and thoroughly mixed
by stirring with appropriate quantities of herbicide solutions. Pendimethalin
EC, S-MC, or L-MC diluents were then added to the glass containers
to yield a concentration of 1 mg a.i. kg–1 air-dried
soil and an absolute water content of 10%. Untreated soil received
only deionized water but was otherwise handled in an identical way
as the herbicide-treated soil. Each treatment was repeated three times.
Then, the glass containers were sealed and placed in a growth chamber
at 25 ± 2 °C. The mixture (87 g) was removed from each glass
container every 20 days for the bioassay. The bioassay procedure was
performed in a similar way as described in the section title “Bioactivity of Pendimethalin EC and MCs”.
Simultaneously, 20 g of the samples was removed from each glass container,
and the amount of pendimethalin in the soil samples was then detected
using an HPLC system. Extraction and clean-up of pendimethalin from
the soil were carried out according to previously described protocols.49,50 Soil samples (20 g) was weighed and transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge
tube that contained 25 mL of acetone–hexane solution (1:4,
v/v). The pendimethalin in the soil sample was extracted in accordance
with an ultrasonic method for 1 h and then shaken for 30 min by a
table concentrator (100 rpm, 25 °C). After centrifugation, the
supernatant was filtered through filter paper in a round-bottom flask.
Again, 25 mL of acetone–hexane solution was added to centrifuge
tubes, and the same procedure was repeated. The supernatants obtained
from the two extractions were combined. The combined supernatant (25
mL) was removed and transferred to a round-bottom flask and evaporated
at 45 ± 2 °C using a rotary evaporator. After removing the
solvent by reduced pressure distillation, the residue in the round-bottom
flask was dissolved in 2 mL of acetonitrile (HPLC grade) and then
filtered through a 0.22 μm millipore filter (polycaprolactam,
Tianjin Jinteng Experimental Equipment Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China)
for HPLC analysis. The conditions used for HPLC detection were performed
in a similar manner as that described in the Supporting Information.

Field Experiments
Field experiments
were conducted during the growing season in 2015
at the corn farm of Shandong Agricultural University, China (117°10′12″
E, 36°10′47″ N). The same experiment was repeated
in 2016. The soil type was a silty clay loam consisting of 4% clay,
40% silt, 56% sand, and 1.45% OM and had a pH of 6.69. The daily rainfall
and mean temperature data recorded near the experimental area are
shown in Figure 9.
A randomized complete block design was used for the experiment with
four replicates per treatment. The plot size was 2.0 m × 7.0
m, and all plots were separated from the others by a 1 m wide buffer
zone. Corn (Zhengdan 958) was sown in 80 cm rows at 62 500
seeds/ha on June 20, 2015. The herbicides used were pendimethalin
EC, S-MCs, and L-MCs. Detailed designs about herbicide applications
are shown in Table 1. An untreated control was also included. All herbicides were applied
after corn sowing using a backpack sprayer (AGROLEX HD400, Singapore)
with flat-fan nozzles delivering 450 L/ha dilutions. The experimental
area was irrigated with water immediately after herbicide applications.
In addition, all experimental plots were irrigated three times until
harvest. To determine the efficacy of the herbicide, weed species
and weed quantity were assessed at 3, 6, and 10 weeks after herbicide
applications for all plots using four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrants
placed randomly in the plots. In addition, the aboveground biomass
of 1 m2 of each plot was collected and weighed in accordance
with the same protocol in the previous survey.
