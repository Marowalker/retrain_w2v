In this work, we
successfully prepared three different mesoporous
NiO nanostructures with preferential (111) planes using three different
solvents–water, a water–ethanol mixture, and a water–ethylene
glycol mixture. The NiO nanosheets prepared from the water–ethylene
glycol mixture and denoted as NiO-EG showed a nanosheet morphology
thinner than 10 nm, whereas the water–ethanol and water samples
were 30–40 nm and above 100 nm thick, respectively. The NiO-EG catalyst was found to exhibit a high catalyzing ability to activate
peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for decoloring dyes, by which 94.4% of acid
orange 7 (AO7) was degraded under the following reaction conditions:
AO7 = 50 mg/L, catalyst = 0.2 g/L, PMS = 0.8 g/L, pH = 7, and 30 min
reaction time. The dye degradation rate was investigated as a function
of the catalyst dosage, pH, and dye concentration. According to quenching
experiments, it was found that SO4•–, HO•, and
O2•– were the dominant radicals for AO7 degradation, and oxygen vacancies
played a significant role in the generation of radicals. High surface
area, thin flaky structure, rich oxygen vacancies, fast charge transport,
and low diffusion impedance all enhanced the catalytic activity of
NiO-EG, which exhibited the highest degradation ability due to its
abundant accessible active sites for both adsorption and catalysis.

==== Body
Introduction
Environmental pollution,
especially water pollution, is increasingly
becoming a challenging multidisciplinary problem with the rapid development
of industry. Water pollution due to recalcitrant organic contaminants
could lead to serious ecological impacts.1,2 Many
organic contaminants are toxic and non-biodegradable with lethality
and carcinogenicity.3 Meanwhile, organics
are difficult to remove by the conventional biological, physical,
and chemical methods of wastewater treatment.4 Therefore, advanced treatment techniques that offer remarkable treatment
efficiency are highly desired.

In recent decades, advanced oxidation
processes (AOPs) aiming at
treating refractory organic matter in industrial wastewater have attracted
increasing attention. AOPs involve highly reactive radicals such as
hydroxyl radicals (HO•) as the main oxidation species,
which can attack the non-biodegradable organic molecules and oxidize
them into biodegradable low-molecular-weight organics or inorganics,
such as water and carbon dioxide.5−7 Recently, besides HO•, a sulfate radical (SO4•–) has become a promising
alternative due to several advantages compared with HO•. SO4•– can be generated by activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HSO5–, or persulfate (PS, S2O82–)) via ultrasound,8 ultraviolet,9 metal-free heterogeneous
catalysis,10 transition-metal catalysis,11,12 and miscellaneous activation methods. In addition, SO4•– possesses an oxidation potential E0 =
2.5–3.1 V,13 which is comparable
to or even higher than that of HO• (E0 = 2.8 V),14 long lifetime (t1/2 = 30–40 μs),15 and high activity with organic compounds over
a wide pH range of 2–8.16 These
properties make SO4•– an ideal oxidant of AOPs in practical applications.

Transition-metal compounds have been a research hotspot in the
generation of SO4•– due to their low cost, convenience, and wide variety for selection.
Anipsitakis and Dionysiou17 in 2004 systematically
studied several metal ions, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Ru3+, Ce3+, and Ag+, for the activation of peroxymonosulfate,
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and peroxydisulfate
for degradation of 2,4-dicholorophenol. In recent years, heterogeneous
metal oxide compounds have received more attention attributed to their
high activity and good recyclability. Up to now, single and bimetallic
oxides consisting of active Co, Fe, Mn, and Cu have been reported.18 Nickel is a transition metal with valence-changing
properties. Therefore, nickel compounds, such as NiO, have been widely
investigated as photocatalysts or electrocatalysts. However, as for
the PMS catalytic activation, although studies concerning bimetallic
or trimetallic oxides, such as NiFe2O419 and NiCo2O4,20 have been reported, the single oxide, NiO, has
never been investigated for catalyzing PMS.

On the other hand,
the morphology of catalysts significantly affects
their properties.21 It was found that the
shape and crystalline facets and pore microstructure affect the catalytic
properties to a great extent.22,23 NiO nanoparticles with
various morphologies have been synthesized by different methods and
used in the catalytic field.24 The effect
of the NiO microstructure on their catalytic performance for oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane to propene has been reported.25 Layered structure materials usually have high
specific surface area and fast electron transfer, which can accelerate
the catalytic reaction. It is well known that the solvothermal route
can be widely used for the synthesis of nanomaterials, which is convenient
to control the microstructure, facets, and pore size of nanomaterials.
It is reported that different microstructures such as nanoparticles,26,27 nanorods,28 nanosheets, spheres, nanoflowers
consisting of flakes, and nanoflakelets29 have been prepared.

In this study, three mesoporous NiO with
different morphologies
have been prepared via a facile solvothermal method only by changing
the solvent. On this basis, their crystal structure, morphology, pore
size distributions, and surface area were measured. The prepared NiO
catalysts were found, for the first time, to activate PMS for degrading
the organic dye, acid orange 7 (AO7), with high efficiency. The physicochemical
properties, catalytic mechanism, and recyclability of the used catalysts
were also reported.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
patterns of precursors achieved by the solvothermal process are shown
in Figure S1. It can be seen that the NiO-EG
and NiO-E precursors are both indexed to Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (PDF card No. 00-022-0752), whereas
that of NiO-W is indexed to Ni(OH)2 (PDF card No. 00-014-0117).
These samples after calcination at 350 °C exhibit XRD patterns
attributed to NiO (JCPDS card no. 00-047-1049), in which the diffraction
peaks at 37.2, 43.3, and 62.9° correspond to the (111), (200),
and (220) reflections, respectively. No peaks of other crystalline
phases are found, suggesting the high purity of NiO. Compared with
NiO-E and NiO-W, the NiO-EG sample demonstrates an obviously higher
(111) peak intensity, indicating a more preferential (111) lattice in this sample (Figure 1).

Figure 1 XRD patterns of (a) NiO-EG, (b) NiO-E, and (c) NiO-W catalysts.

The difference in the solvent used has a critical
influence on
the morphology and microstructure of the NiO catalysts, as shown in
scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Figure 2). NiO-EG presents as nanoflakes with only
1–10 nm thickness and abundant nanopores on the surface (Figure 2a,b). As for NiO-E,
a flowerlike structure formed by self-assembly of nanosheets is obtained
with a few pores on the surface of petals (Figure 2c,d). The flowerlike spheres have a size
ranging from 1 to 8 μm and are formed by nanosheets of 15–30
nm thickness. In the presence of pure water as the solvent, NiO-W
exhibits a regular hexagonal platelet shape and a sponge structure
with a size of 1 μm and 100 nm thickness.

Figure 2 SEM images of (a, b)
NiO-EG; (c, d) NiO-E; and (e, f) NiO-W catalysts.

Because all NiO catalysts were prepared under the same conditions
except for solvent, we can infer that the difference in morphology
is a result of changing the solvent system (Scheme 1). As an organic solvent, ethylene glycol
has two hydroxyl groups. Zhu et al. reported that because of the effects
of hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups, ethylene glycol could
serve as a ligand to form a chainlike coordination complex with metal
ions, and the as-formed chainlike complexes would congregate and self-assemble
into bundles when such chains become sufficiently long.30 However, due to the presence of water and absence
of a surfactant, some effects of ethylene glycol are weakened, such
as viscosity and chelation, which prohibits the formation of spherelike
superstructures but leads to the growth of flakes.31 As shown in Figure S2, a significant
difference observed between NiO-EG-2 and NiO-EG-6 is the size of nanosheets,
which grew bigger after 4 h of the solvothermal process. These two
samples have the same microstructure and lattice structure as NiO-EG,
confirming the growth mechanism. Li et al. synthesized flowerlike
CuS in an ethanol/water system. They found that ethanol has a tendency
to self-aggregate in aqueous medium at high temperatures, thus forming
micro-heterogeneities, which can improve the microemulsion droplet
nucleation rate in the hydrothermal reaction process, meaning that
ions can be assembled onto the microemulsion droplet surfaces more
easily.32 In the same way, Ni2+ followed a similar process in an ethanol/water system and self-assembled
into a flowerlike structure. As for NiO-W, Ni(OH)2 is formed
by the hydrolysis of urea as a precursor at the initial stage of the
hydrothermal process.33 The faster initial
nucleation and growth rates and an oriented attachment mechanism result
in the formation of a hexagonal platelet structure.34

Scheme 1 Formation Mechanism of NiO Catalysts
The NiO catalysts were further characterized by transmission
electron
microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Figure 3). All NiO catalysts exhibit
a porous structure. In Figure 3b, the HRTEM image of NiO-EG nanoflakes demonstrates clear
lattice fringes. The interplanar spacing is 0.147 nm, corresponding
to the (220) planes of the isometric system of NiO. The inset of Figure 3b shows the selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the NiO-EG nanoflakes, revealing
that the nanoflakes consist of crystalline NiO. The set of diffraction
spots can be indexed as the [1̅11] zone axis of cubic NiO. The
SAED pattern of NiO-E (inset of Figure 3d) consists of three diffraction rings, which represent
the (111), (200), and (220) planes, respectively, indicating that
the petals of flowerlike NiO-E are polycrystalline. The TEM image
of NiO-W (Figure 3e)
shows a single hexagonal platelet shape, which agrees with the SEM
result discussed above. The 0.147 nm intervals of the lattice observed
in the HRTEM image (Figure 3f) agree well with the spacing of the (220) plane. This indicates
that the NiO nanoplatelets are perfect single-crystalline sheets and
the (111) planes form the main surfaces of the nanosheets.35 The much thinner nanosheets of NiO-EG means
it contains a much larger percentage of the (111) planes than the
other two samples, which is consistent with the XRD results. It has
been previously reported that the (111) planes of NiO have more unsaturated
surface O atoms and higher surface energy than the commonly exposed
(220) facets, which results in an enhanced catalytic activity in the
activation of PMS.36 Therefore, the NiO-EG
catalyst is expected to possess higher catalytic ability for PMS decomposition
and further dye degradation in this study.

NiO-W. The insets are the corresponding SAED patterns of NiO-EG, NiO-E,
and NiO-W.

N2 adsorption and desorption
measurements were performed
to investigate the specific surface area, the average pore size, and
its distribution in different NiO catalysts, and the results are depicted
in Figure 4. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface areas of the NiO-EG, NiO-E, and NiO-W catalysts
are 87.36, 50.93, and 94.84 m2 g–1, respectively.
The average pore sizes calculated by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods are 3.1, 15.5, and 7.8 nm, respectively. The isotherm
of NiO-EG is of type II, representing the presence of a macroporous
structure, whereas the isotherms of the NiO-E and NiO-W catalysts
are all of type IV, representing predominantly mesoporous structure
characteristics. However, the isotherm of NiO-EG has a hysteresis
loop of type H3, which confirms the existence of slitlike open pores,
whereas a hysteresis loop of type H2 is observed in the isotherms
of both NiO-E and NiO-W, which is characteristic of ink-bottle-type
pores on the surface of catalysts. The pore is formed by the release
of water or NO2 in the thermal transformation of Ni(OH)2 or Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 into NiO. The molecular size of AO7 and PMS is 1.3637 and 0.2 nm,38 respectively,
which is much smaller than the pore size. Compared with ink-bottle-type
pores, the slitlike open pores on the surface of NiO-EG provide more
accessible active sites and accelerate the catalytic reaction. Due
to the narrow neck of the ink bottle, it is difficult for the dye molecules and PMS
molecules to be adsorbed and attach to the active sites inside the
catalysts and the reaction products to desorb, which is unfavorable
for mass transfer. The pore structure is consistent with that in the
thick NiO-E and NiO-W, as observed from the SEM and TEM images. The
large pore size of NiO-E causes the loss of surface area and active
surface sites. Although the NiO-W has a much larger pore size and
an even higher surface area than NiO-EG, its thickness as high as
100 nm may hinder the dye molecule diffusion into and the product
out of the pores.

size distributions (inset) of (a) NiO-EG, (b) NiO-E, and (c) NiO-W

Removal of AO7 with NiO
Catalysts by PMS Activation
A typical degradation profile
of AO7 by NiO catalysts is given in Figure 5. For comparing the
capacity of different NiO catalysts in AO7 removal, a blank test was
also conducted. According to the results, NiO-EG possesses the highest
catalytic capacity in removing AO7 in the presence of PMS compared
to NiO-E and NiO-W. For example, 94.4% of AO7 was removed in 30 min
by NiO-EG, whereas 91.0% and 89.7% of AO7 were removed by NiO-E and
NiO-W under the same conditions, respectively. Only 16% of AO7 was
removed after 30 min under the same conditions without catalysts.
Meanwhile, 42% of AO7 was absorbed by NiO-EG in 30 min without PMS
and the AO7 concentration showed no change in the next 30 min, indicating
that the NiO itself cannot degrade AO7 but has strong adsorption ability
toward it. This suggests that all three NiO catalysts possess the
capacity of catalyzing PMS to oxidize AO7, while different microstructures
result in different catalytic abilities. NiO-W has the highest BET
specific surface area and high adsorbance of AO7 but the lowest removal
of AO7, owing to its microstructure. According to the SEM images,
NiO-W has a spongelike structure with size ranging from 0.9 to 1.5
μm and 100 nm in thickness, which makes it more difficult for
AO7 and PMS molecules to spread into the NiO-W nanoplatelets and attach
to more active sites. However, NiO-EG displays a flaky structure with
a thickness of a few nanometers and open porous surface, which provides
more available active sites and accelerates the activation of PMS,
resulting in the excellent performance of the NiO-EG catalyst.

The results of the catalytic degradation
of AO7 and some other
organic contaminants by catalyst/PMS systems reported previously are
listed and compared with our study in Table 1. In comparison to other research studies,
the NiO-EG prepared in this study exhibited higher catalytic efficiency
even at an increased dye concentration and lower catalyst dosage.
We explored the possible reasons besides the surface area and the
(111) planes of the catalyst in our study, which was further investigated
later.

Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Measurements
EIS measurements
were employed to investigate the charge transfer
ability of the NiO catalysts. The results are shown in Figure 6. These spectra consist of
a typical semicircle in the high–medium-frequency region and
a linear portion in the low-frequency range, which can be ascribed
to the charge-transfer resistance and diffusion impedance, respectively.
The radius of the semicircle of NiO-EG is smaller than that of the
other two NiO catalysts, indicating a decrease in the charge-transfer
resistance and enhancement of the charge transfer in the NiO-EG catalyst.
At low frequencies, NiO-EG presents a smaller slope than NiO-E and
NiO-W, suggesting that the NiO-EG exhibits a low diffusion resistance
inside the catalyst. This should be attributed to the flaky open-porous
structure of NiO-EG and is propitious to the charge transfer for PMS activation (Table 2).

Effect of Catalyst
Dosage, Initial AO7 Concentration, and Solution
Initial pH
The influence of catalyst dosage on AO7 degradation
is shown in Figure 7a. With the increase in NiO-EG dosage from 0.1 to 0.3 g/L, the AO7
degradation efficiency was enhanced from 68.0 to 98.3% in 20 min.
As the catalyst dosage increased, more active sites were provided
for PMS activation, which caused faster formation of active radicals,
and more AO7 molecules were absorbed, resulting in the remarkable
enhancement of AO7 degradation efficiency.

Figure 7 Effects of (a) catalyst
dosage, (b) initial AO7 concentration,
and (c) initial pH on the catalytic degradation of AO7 by the NiO/PMS
system.

The influence of initial AO7 concentration
on its degradation efficiency
via the activation of PMS is shown in Figure 7b. At the initial AO7 concentrations of 25,
40 and 50 mg/L, the AO7 degradation efficiency achieved were 98.3,
98.3, and 94.4% within 30 min, respectively. But only 88.7 and 72.1%
of AO7 were decomposed at the initial concentrations of 60 and 75
mg/L in the same reaction time, respectively. In general, with the
increase in AO7 concentration, the degradation efficiency decreased.
As the AO7 concentration increased, more sulfate radicals were required.
However, considering that the same concentration of catalysts and
oxidants only produced the same amount of sulfate radicals, the degradation
efficiency inevitably decreased. In addition, massive AO7 molecules
may reduce the contact probability between NiO and PMS, which is not
conducive to the formation of sulfate radicals.

The influence
of the initial pH on the AO7 degradation efficiency
with PMS by NiO-EG is shown in Figure 7c. The removal efficiency of AO7 at 30 min could reach
over 90% in a wide pH range from 5 to 8. With the increase in solution
initial pH, the removal efficiency increased from 82.9 to 98.8%. In
general, pH plays a significant role in the activation of PMS and
surface charge of catalysts. In acidic medium, NiO-EG exhibited increasing
AO7 removal from 82.9 to 95.5% as the pH rose from 4 to 7. At pH =
4, only 82.9% of AO7 could be removed within 30 min, which might be
ascribed to the fact that excessive H+ would scavenge the
SO4•– and HO• radicals (eqs 1 and 2).45 The advantages of the NiO/PMS system in degrading
AO7 were obviously presented in both acid and alkaline medium (pH
5–8). 1   2  

Recycle Tests
Recyclability is an important factor
that evaluates the performance of catalysts in practical applications.46 Duan et al. synthesized cobalt-based perovskites
for activating PMS to degrade phenol with a removal efficiency of
100% in 30 min, which decreased to 82% after 3 cycles.47 Zhang et al. used granular activated carbon
to catalyze PMS to degrade AO7 with a degradation efficiency of 85%
within 300 min, and 78.5% of AO7 removal was achieved in the fourth
run.40

Four cycling runs were performed
under the same experimental conditions to evaluate the reusability
of the prepared NiO-EG catalyst. The related results are shown in Figure 8. It is apparent
that the degradation removal of AO7 decreases only slightly from 95.4
to 94.8% at 30 min after four cycles, which shows the excellent stability
of NiO-EG during the degradation. These results indicate that NiO-EG
processes excellent stability, which may provide a fundamental basis
for its practical applications.

Figure 8 Consecutive runs of the catalytic activities
of NiO-EG. Reaction
conditions: [AO7] = 50 mg/L, catalyst = 0.2 g/L, PMS = 0.8 g/L, and
pH = 7.

Exploration of the Catalytic
Mechanism
Quenching experiments
were conducted to explore the efficient radicals in the NiO/PMS system.
As reported, activation of PMS via heterogeneous transition-metal
oxides usually generates several critical active species, namely,
sulfate (SO4•–), hydroxyl (HO•), superoxide radical (O2•–), and peroxymonosulfate (SO5•–). Among them, SO5•– with a redox potential of 1.1 V at pH 7, which is much lower than
that of SO4•– and HO•, makes negligible contribution to the
degradation of AO7. Therefore, only superoxide, sulfate, and hydroxyl
radicals are considered. Ethanol is an efficient scavenger of both
SO4•– and HO• (kHO• = 1.2–2.8 × 109 M–1 s–1; kSO4•– = 1.6–7.7
× 107 M–1 s–1),
while the reaction rate between tert-butyl alcohol
(TBA) and HO• (3.8–7.6 × 108 M–1 s–1) is about 1000-fold
faster than that with SO4•– (4.0–9.1 × 105 M–1 s–1).48 Thus, ethanol was chosen as a scavenger for both SO4•– and HO•, whereas TBA was employed as a scavenger
for HO•. In addition, benzoquinone was used as a
quencher to examine the role of O2•–.4949

As shown in Figure 9, an observed inhibition on
the removal efficiency of AO7 occurred within 30 min with the addition
of the scavenger. The degradation efficiency was decreased by 6.8%
and 15.4% when 5 and 10 mM ethanol were added, respectively. In contrast,
a much weaker inhibition effect appeared even when the same amount
of TBA (10 mM) was added, indicating that both SO4•– and HO• were produced in the NiO/PMS system and participated in the degradation
of AO7. However, this quenching efficiency is quite far from that
in other reports.50,51 Fan et al. quenched SO4•– and HO• with EtOH in an FeOOH/PMS system, obtaining
a decrease from 91.7 to 35.9% in AO7 removal efficiency.52 It has been reported that as hydrophilic compounds,
EtOH and TBA had low affinity for the catalyst surface and could only
consume SO4•– and HO• in the liquid phase.40 Thus, if the generated radicals are bound or caged on the
surface of the catalyst during the catalytic oxidation process, the
quenching effect of EtOH and TBA would be inconspicuous. Meanwhile,
other radicals, such as O2•–, generated in the PMS system
are also reported. With the addition of benzoquinone, 77.6% of AO7
was removed in 30 min, revealing that O2•– was also involved in
the degradation process. Therefore, three radicals, SO4•–, HO•, and O2•–, were generated in the NiO/PMS
system. A similar mechanism is also reported in the heterogeneous
activation of a CuFe2O4/PMS system.53

NiO/PMS
system. Reaction conditions: [AO7] = 50 mg/L, catalyst = 0.2 g/L,
PMS = 0.8 g/L, and pH = 7.

To further explore the catalytic mechanism, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to analyze the chemical valence change
of nickel and oxygen atoms on the surface of the fresh and used NiO
catalysts. From Figure S3a, the full-range
XPS spectrum of NiO-EG indicates that Ni and O are the main elements
in the samples with a peak of C 1s (284.8 eV), which is used as an
internal reference. The high-resolution scans of the fresh and used
NiO-EG catalyst for Ni 2p3/2 are shown in Figure 10a. Before the reaction, the
peaks at 853.4, 854.9, and 860.2 eV are assigned to the Ni2+ species in NiO, whereas the peaks at 855.9 and 860.9 eV are assigned
to the Ni3+ species on the NiO surface that formed due
to defects. These values suggest the coexistence of Ni2+ and Ni3+.54 After
the reaction, the peaks of Ni 2p3/2 for Ni2+ and Ni3+ are slightly shifted to 853.6, 855.1, 860.3,
856.2, and 861.2 eV, respectively, indicating that during the reaction,
part of Ni2+ were transformed into Ni3+. The
extent of the variation of the Ni3+ ions is surveyed by
calculating the peak area ratio of Ni3+ to Ni2+. Results show that the percentage of Ni2+ and Ni3+ changed from 70.3 and 29.7% to 68.4 and 31.6% after use,
respectively, which is much lower than that reported by other works.
It is reported by Wang et al. that Ni2+ in a NiFe2O4 catalyst decreased from 64.6 to 46.3% after degradation
of benzoic acid.19 Zhao et al. synthesized
Co–Mn LDH and found that after degradation of dyes, Mn3+ decreased from 71.1 to 55.2%.50 The increase in Ni3+ percentage in the used sample confirms
that part of Ni2+ were transformed into Ni3+ during the degradation reaction. The XPS spectra demonstrate the coexistence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ and the increase of Ni3+ in the used NiO-EG catalyst,
which suggest that the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox cycle
may be the reaction pathway for the activation of PMS and this redox
cycle also makes a contribution to the stability of NiO-EG. The XPS
O 1s spectrum and its deconvolution for fresh and used NiO-EG are
shown in Figure S4a. Two clearly separated
peaks at 529.0 and 530.6 eV can be detected, which are attributed
to lattice oxygen and O2– ions in the oxygen-deficient
regions, respectively.55 A shift occurs
after the reaction, and the peaks are slightly shifted to 529.2 and
530.8 eV. The peaks at 532.0 and 532.2 eV correspond to the hydroxyl-related
species or the loosely bound oxygen on the surface.56 Compared with NiO-EG, the XPS spectra of NiO-W show similar
results (Figures 10b, Figure S3b and S4b). But the NiO-W
catalyst contains fewer Ni3+ (17.9%) on the surface, corresponding
to fewer oxide vacancies, which we consider as one of the reasons
for the lower degradation efficiency of NiO-W than that of NiO-EG.
Further research was performed as given below.

Figure 10 Ni 2p XPS spectra of
the fresh and used (a) NiO-EG and (b) NiO-W.

Oxygen vacancies are important factors influencing the catalytic
reactions, such as catalytic oxidation.57 On this basis, O2-TPD measurements were conducted to
identify the oxide species on the surface of the NiO catalysts (Figure 11). The desorption
peaks below 150 °C usually belong to the physically adsorbed
oxygen species, whereas the desorption peaks between 300 and 700 °C
are attributed to the O2– or O– species, formed by the oxygen
adsorbed on the surface oxide vacancies.58 The peaks above 700 °C are associated with the surface lattice
oxygen species (O2–). The NiO-W physically adsorbed
more oxygen, according to its higher specific surface area, than NiO-EG.
However, the amount of adsorbed O2– or O– species for
NiO-EG was much higher compared with that for NiO-W, suggesting that
there were more oxygen vacancies on the surface of NiO-EG. Oxide vacancies
might function as active sites for dissociative adsorption of water
on metal oxide surfaces at which hydroxyl groups are formed.59 In the neutral state, these surface hydroxyl
groups would be a major part responsible for the generation of radicals.60 In addition, oxygen vacancies promote electronic
transfer and participate in the redox cycle of Ni2+/Ni3+, which is feasible for the activation of PMS.61

Figure 11 O2-TPD spectra of (a) NiO-EG and (b) NiO-W.

Oxygen vacancies play an important role in the
high reactivity
of NiO-EG. The generation of oxygen vacancies should be attributed
to the unique property of ethylene glycol and the surface characteristics
of the (111) plane. It was reported that ethylene glycol could easily
react with oxygen-terminated oxide surfaces, during which the oxidation
of the alcohol groups would produce aldehydes and acids. Then, some
surface oxygen atoms are removed, resulting in the formation of oxygen
vacancies.62 Thus, we propose that the
highest degradation efficiency shown by NiO-EG is mainly attributed
to the combination effect of its flaky porous structure and abundant
oxygen vacancies on its surface, which enhance charge transfer and
provide easy access of high surface areas and highly reactive surface
sites. The preparation methods are simple and versatile, and this
work may shed light on the metal oxide catalyst design and synthesis
for water treatment.

Based on the above results, we proposed
the mechanism of PMS catalytic
activation and dye degradation by the NiO/PMS system as follows 3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  First, SO4•– was generated by the reaction
between Ni2+ on the surface of the catalyst and PMS (eq 3). HO• was also produced by the reaction of SO4•– with water molecules
or hydroxyls in the solution subsequently (eqs 4 and 5). Ni3+ then oxidized PMS to SO5•– that combined with each other
to generate SO4•– and O2 and transformed into the original Ni2+ (eqs 6 and 7).19 Herein, the Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couples formed, enhancing the recyclability
of the NiO catalysts, which was also evidenced by XPS. By means of
one-electron transfer, O2•– was formed through the oxygen absorbed on
the oxygen vacancies (eq 8), which could also react with water molecules to produce HO• (eq 9).63 The generated radical species, SO4•–, O2•–, and HO• attacked the dye molecules and degraded
the target pollutants into small molecular inorganic compounds (eq 10). And the reversible
oxidation and reduction between Ni3+/Ni2+ maintained
the structure of the catalyst and high activation activity for PMS.

Conclusions
Several mesoporous NiO catalysts with thin flaky,
flowerlike, and
thick spongelike plate structures were prepared by a simple solvothermal
method, and their shape-control activity was evaluated in catalytic
activation of PMS for AO7 degradation. The NiO prepared using ethylene
glycol as the solvent with a high surface area and thin flaky structure
exhibited the highest degradation ability due to its abundant accessible
active sites for both adsorption and catalysis. Rich oxygen vacancies,
active oxygen species, fast charge transport, and low diffusion impedance
all enhanced the catalytic activity of NiO-EG. In addition, the degradation
efficiency improved with the increase in NiO-EG dosage but was inhibited
with the increase in the initial concentration of AO7. The pH tests
showed that the NiO/PMS system had a wide application range of pH
(5–8). NiO-EG also exhibited high catalytic stability with
little deactivation after four runs. Radical quenching studies suggested
that SO4•–, HO•, and O2•– were generated during the PMS activation. The high activity and
stable performance of NiO-EG makes it a promising catalyst for activating
PMS to oxidize organic pollutants.

Experimental Section
Materials
Nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), urea, ethylene glycol, acid orange 7 (AO7), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), ethanol, sodium nitrite (NaNO2),
and peroxymonosulfate (PMS), available as a triple salt
of sulfate commercially known as oxone (2KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4), were obtained from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Para-benzoquinone
was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were of
analytical grade and used without further purification. The experimental
solutions were prepared with deionized water. The solution pH was
adjusted using 1 M NaOH.

Synthesis of NiO Catalysts
Three
NiO catalysts were
synthesized via solvothermal methods with different solvents. Typically,
5 mmol nickel nitrate and urea were dissolved in 25 mL of solvent
and 5 mL of deionized water to form a green solution. The sample using
ethylene glycol as the solvent was referred to as NiO-EG, that using
ethanol as the solvent was referred to as NiO-E, and that using deionized
water as the solvent was referred to as NiO-W. The mixed solution
was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed
and maintained at 180 °C for 10 h and was then cooled to room
temperature naturally. The solvothermal product was filtered, washed
with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in air at 50 °C overnight.
Finally, all three samples were calcined at 350 °C under air
for 4 h to obtain the catalysts. To investigate the formation of the
NiO-EG catalyst, two samples were synthesized in the same way as NiO-EG,
except that the reaction time in the solvothermal process was shortened
to 2 and 6 h, respectively. These samples were referred to as NiO-EG-2
and NiO-EG-6, respectively.

Characterization of Catalysts
X-ray
diffraction (XRD)
patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Discover (Bruker-AXS, Karlsruhe,
Germany) diffractometer using a filtered Cu Kα radiation source
(λ = 1.54178 Å), scanned at 2θ from 10 to 80°.
The specific surface area of catalysts was investigated by N2 adsorption at 77 K, using the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method (Autosorb iQ, Quantachrome). Prior to the measurements,
the samples were dehydrated in vacuum at 175 °C for 6 h. The
pore size distributions were calculated from desorption branches of
the isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
The morphology of the catalyst was observed on a TF20 JEOL 2100F transmission
electron microscope (TEM) and a FEI Magellan 400 field-emission scanning
electron microscope. O2 temperature-programmed desorption
(O2-TPD) was conducted on a gas flow system (AutoChem II
2920, Micromeritics). Typically, the catalyst sample (40 mg) was placed
in a U-shaped quartz reactor and pretreated in flowing O2 (15 mL/min) for 2 h at 350 °C, followed by cooling at room
temperature. Then the temperature was raised from room temperature
to 900 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min in a He flow (30 mL/min).
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were taken on a Thermo
Scientific instrument, ESCALAB 250XI using X-ray source Al Kα
radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV).

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical measurements
were performed using a Solartron Analytical 1470E CellTest System
in a standard three-electrode cell. An Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode
and a platinum wire were used as the reference electrode and counter
electrode, respectively. A glassy carbon electrode modified with a
homogeneous catalyst ink, which was prepared via sonication of 10
mg of catalyst powder, 40 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1 mL of absolute ethanol, was used as the working electrode, and
the electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4. Electrochemical
impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded within a frequency range from
105 to 10–1 Hz.

Catalytic Activity Tests
Catalytic activity tests were
carried out in a 150 mL conical flask containing 100 mL of aqueous
solution with a certain concentration of AO7. First, the catalyst
was added into the solution. The mixture was stirred for 30 min to
reach the balance between the catalyst and AO7. Subsequently, a fixed
amount of PMS was added to start the oxidation reaction. Then, 1 M
NaOH solution was also added into the solution to adjust the pH to
7. Samples were obtained at regular intervals, withdrawn from the
mixture using a syringe filter of 0.22 μm and mixed with NaNO2 immediately to quench the reaction. The concentration of
AO7 was analyzed by a 725N UV–vis spectrophotometer at 484
nm. For comparison, the catalytic activity tests were conducted without
adding the catalyst or PMS under the same conditions. During the recycling
experiment, the catalyst was collected by vacuum filtration and thoroughly
washed with distilled water and ethanol after each recycle. Then the
catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 24 h to remove
water and ethanol.
