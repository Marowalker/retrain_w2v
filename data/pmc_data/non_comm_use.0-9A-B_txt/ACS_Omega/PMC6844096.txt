related to quality of coated
paper, especially printability. Its structure mainly consists of pigment,
binder, and additives. Binder has a significant influence on the coating
structure because it is involved in the structure forming process
and takes a key role in maintaining the structure. In this study,
styrene acrylate (S/A) latex with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)

on latex swelling and coating structure was investigated. The S/A
latex particle swelled more with an increasing HEMA content, which
significantly influenced coating color and coating layer characteristics.
The viscosity of coating color became thick, and the dewatering of
coating color was suppressed. The HEMA monomer that swelled latex
particle allowed the coating layer to consolidate rapidly, which made
the coating layer more porous and more uniform.

1 Introduction
Paper coating is a widely
used technique for improving the appearance
and printability of paper. Paper coating enhances the gloss, opacity,
brightness, and printability of paper. However, there are several
quality issues for coated papers. One of the most widely occurring
problems for coated paper is print mottle, an unevenness of gloss
or color density of the printed surface. This print mottle is usually
caused by variations in the ink-setting rate after printing, which
stems from the nonuniformity of the binder distribution or the pore
structure of the coating layer.1−5 To solve the problem of print mottle, it is necessary to control
the coating structure and make it more uniform.

Coating colors
have pigments, binders, and additives as their main
components. Pigments are the basic building blocks of the coating
layer, whereas additives adjust the rheological properties of the
coating colors or impart special functional properties to the coated
paper. Binders that bind all components in the coating layer are used
to maintain the structure of the coating. They also play an important
role in the consolidation of the coating layer.6 It is well known that the structure of coating layer changes
by the binder type and its migration that occurs before the consolidation
of coating layer.7 Therefore, the physical
and chemical properties of binders have a significant influence on
the structure of pigment coating layers.

In this research, we
investigated the role of the functional monomer
hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) in styrene acrylate (S/A) latex,
which is one of the most widely used latexes in paper coating. The
properties of S/A latexes are affected by the glass transition temperature,
cross-linking degree, particle size, and so forth. Previous research
showed that it is possible to change various properties of coating
colors and coated papers with the use of functional comonomers.8,9 Among the several functional monomers tested, including acrylonitrile,
acrylic acid, ethyl hexyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, and HEMA,
the most significant improvement in print mottle was obtained when
HEMA was used as a comonomer.9 The use
of HEMA as a comonomer for S/A latex increased the viscosity and water
retention of the coating color and the ink absorption uniformity.
Previous research, however, has only investigated the effect of comonomers
using a single comonomer composition.9 In
addition, the change in coating structure as a function of the comonomer
ratios has not been examined.

HEMA, also called glycol methacrylate
or glycol monomethacrylate,
is a hydrophilic monomer first synthesized in 1936.10 HEMA has been used in the medical field because of its
stability and hydrophilic properties since hydrogel-formed polymers
were introduced in 1960.11 Through a hydroxyl
group in HEMA, a polymer containing this monomer can interact with
water even though hydrophobic monomers are major components of the
polymer.12−15 The effects of HEMA as a comonomer in S/A latex have been examined,16−18 and it has been shown that HEMA can intensify the swelling of S/A
latex in alkaline conditions. As most coating processes are performed
under alkaline conditions, this swelling would seem to have effects
on the coating structure. However, the S/A latexes used in these studies
contained too much HEMA monomer to use them as paper coating binders.

The swelling of latex particles occurs when the carboxyl groups
dissociate into carboxylate ions. The negatively charged carboxylate
ions cause electrical repulsion between the latex particles and between
the polymer chains within the particles. Electrical repulsion between
the latex particles stabilizes the latex suspension, whereas the repulsion
between the polymer chains within the particle causes swelling of
the particle. A hydrophilic monomer improves the mobility of the polymer
chains, which helps hydroxyl ions penetrate the latex particles, resulting
in greater swelling of the particles.19 Thus, the properties of S/A latex may change substantially depending
upon the amount of HEMA comonomer.

The immediate purpose of
this study was to explore the effects
of the HEMA monomer on S/A latex and its effect on the consolidation
and structure of the coating layer. The structural change of the pigment
coating layer associated with the use of S/A latex as a binder was
investigated, and the property changes and mechanism involved in the
S/A latex with different levels of HEMA as a comonomer were discussed.
The final goal of this study was to elucidate the effect of the HEMA
content in S/A latex on the coating structure.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Swelling of S/A Latex Particles
The
hydrophilicity of HEMA had a significant influence on the latex swelling. Figure 1a shows the hydrodynamic
diameters of the S/A latex particles at pH 4 and 9 as a function of
HEMA content. The particle size of the S/A latex remained almost constant
at pH 4, irrespective of the HEMA content. However, the particle size
increased substantially at pH 9 with increasing HEMA content. This
indicates that the hydroxyethyl groups of HEMA had a synergic effect
on the ionization of the carboxyl groups in alkaline conditions and
made the S/A latex particles swell more. The increase in the S/A latex
particle diameters in alkaline condition for the high-HEMA latex resulted
in its greater swelling coefficient (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) Hydrodynamic diameters of S/A latex particles
and (b) swelling
coefficient of the S/A latexes.

The swelling was examined by measuring the relative viscosity as
well as hydrodynamic diameter. The dynamic light scattering (DLS)
and relative viscosity data indicated similar tendencies in the swelling
properties. The relative viscosity of the S/A latex suspension increased
with the increasing volume fraction of the S/A latex (Figure 2a), and the S/A latexes with
more HEMA showed greater relative viscosities. Figure 2b depicts the relative viscosity data according
to the Mooney equation given in eq 2. From the intercepts and slopes of the respective
plots, the intrinsic viscosities and critical volume fractions were
calculated (Table 1). The critical volume fractions decreased with increasing HEMA content,
whereas the intrinsic viscosities increased with HEMA content. Both
critical volume fraction and intrinsic viscosity were used to obtain
the swelling coefficients.

The swelling coefficients obtained from all three
methods increased
as the HEMA content increased, corresponding with previous research16−18 (Figure 3). It appeared
that the synergic effect of swelling occurred when carboxyl groups
and hydroxyl groups coexisted in the S/A latex. This shows that the
hydrophilicity of HEMA is one of the major factors responsible for
S/A latex swelling. The presence of a hydroxyl group in HEMA increased
the hydrophilic property of the S/A latex particles, which contributed
to the particle swelling by absorbing and holding more water in the
S/A latex. Consequently, the hydrophilic swelling of the S/A latex
particles made the particles behave like larger ones at higher solids
contents.

Figure 3 Swelling coefficients from three different methods.

Quadrat et al.5 discussed the reason why swelling coefficients from the three methods were different
each other. Intrinsic viscosity is obtained when the volume fractions
of suspensions are approaching zero. Thus, the swelling coefficient
from the intrinsic viscosity shows the particle swelling at extremely
low concentrations, which is around 0.01 wt %. On the other hands,
the critical volume fraction describes the volume fraction when the
viscosity of suspensions becomes infinite. The swelling of the latex
particles would be restricted at such high volume fractions because
not enough space is available for swelling as in low concentrations,
which resulted in lower swelling coefficient from Mooney equation.

Figure 4 shows the
images of S/A latex particles treated with acid and alkali. In the
acidic condition, the particles had distinct surface, and the uranyl
acetate, used for dying, was continuously attached to the surface.
However, the surface was not so distinct in the alkaline condition
compared with its counterpart, which appeared definitely in HEMA 9%
conditions. In the alkaline condition, the S/A latex particles, containing
9% of HEMA, were larger than those in acidic conditions, indicating
the swelling of the particles. The S/A latex particles had a vague
boundary and the dye attached discretely, which also showed nonuniform
particle swelling.

pH 4-HEMA
9%, (c) pH 9-HEMA 0%, and (d) pH 9-HEMA 9%.

To investigate the particles in the suspension state, cryo-TEM
images were acquired. Figure 5 shows the quick-frozen latex particles in acidic and alkaline
conditions. The latex particles in the acidic condition had clear
boundaries, and they were similar in shape, irrespective of the HEMA
content. It is also clear that the color density of the outer part
of the latex particle was lower than that of the core part of the
latex. This suggests that the outer part had a different chemical
composition from the core part. It is usual practice to use carboxylic
or hydrophilic groups in latex polymerization, and these groups are
mainly arranged near the outer part of the latex particle to increase
the stability and binding force of the latex.

latex particles. (a) pH 4-HEMA 0%, (b) pH
4-HEMA 9%, (c) pH 9-HEMA 0%, and (d) pH 9-HEMA 9%.

The shape of the S/A latex particles in the alkaline condition
was different. Latex particles with 9% HEMA did not show a clear outline,
and their shape looks stellate. This might be because the polymer
chains in the outer part were highly swollen or spread in the alkaline
condition. However, the degree of swelling was not the same all around
the particle surface. Some parts of the latex particle swelled more
than other parts, probably because the distribution of HEMA comonomer
was not uniform across the whole particle surface.

2.2 Volume Fraction, Dewatering Property, and
Low-Shear Viscosity of Coating Color
The solid volume fractions
of coating components for four coating colors were similar when the
swelling effect by HEMA comonomer was not considered. The effective
volume fractions determined by applying the swelling coefficient,
however, were higher than those derived without considering the particle
swelling (Figure 6a).
Because the swollen latex particles occupied more space in the coating
color, the effective volume fraction of the coating color also increased
with increasing HEMA content. However, the effective volume fraction
calculated from the critical volume fraction did not increase much.
According to the previous research,5 the
swelling coefficient from the intrinsic viscosity describes the low-concentration
condition, but the coefficient from the critical volume fraction represents
higher concentration conditions. Considering the solids content of
coating color of 62 wt %, the actual volume fraction would be higher
than the effective volume fraction from Mooney equation, but it would
be much lower than that from DLS data. Hence, it seems that there
was latex swelling in the alkaline coating colors, yet the effect
was suppressed to a great extent in the high solid coating colors
because of the limitation in free space and high pigment content in
the coating color.

Figure 6 (a) Effective volume fraction of coating color and (b)
low-shear
viscosity and dewatering amount of coating color.

The hydrophilicity of HEMA greatly affected the low-shear viscosity
of the coating color (Figure 6b). The increase in effective volume is a probable cause of
the viscosity increase. Further, the water retention of the coating
color was improved by HEMA, that is, the dewatering amount decreased
with increasing amounts of HEMA.

2.3 Drying
Kinetics of the Coating Layer
The consolidation of the coating
layer was monitored by MS-DWS (Figure 7). The movement of
the particles slowed as the coating layer dried. According to previous
research,20 particles in a coating layer
form a network structure and the speckle rate (SR) decreases abruptly
at the specific time, that is, the immobilization point. Interestingly,
the immobilization point appeared earlier in high-HEMA conditions.
It was 584.4, 538.4, 490.0, and 459.8 s when the HEMA content was
0, 3, 6, and 9%, respectively (Table 2). The solid content of the coating layer was also
lower in the high-HEMA conditions compared with the low- and no-HEMA
conditions. From these data, it can be deduced that the network structure
formed earlier when the S/A latex binder had more HEMA monomers. Figure 4 shows that the particle
size of the latex with more HEMA was larger in the alkaline condition.
This suggested that the coating color was immobilized earlier because
of the latex swelling. Binders in the coating layer migrate before
the immobilization of the coating layer.7 Uneven binder distribution caused by nonuniform binder migration,
which often associated with the late immobilization of coating, gives
nonuniform printing.4 Therefore, the swelling
of latex that causes early immobilization would improve the uniformity
of the coating layer and printing quality of coated paper. The initial
values of the SR showed differences as well, that is, the initial
value decreased with increasing HEMA amount in the S/A latex, from
9.7 to 5.9 Hz. These results suggest that even in the initial stage
of drying, particle movement was hindered by the swelling of the S/A
latexes with HEMA.

Figure 7 Drying kinetics of the coating layer.

0	9.7	584.4	75.7	82.1

2.4 Structure of the Coating Layer
SEM
images of the coating layer were obtained to analyze the surface structure
(Figure 8). A more
porous structure was formed in the HEMA 9% condition compared with
the no-HEMA condition, which was more remarkable in the images at
high magnification (Figure 8c,d). This result corresponds with the porosity and pore-size
distribution results (Figure 9). Figure 9a shows the pore-size distribution of the coating layer. The coating
layer with the HEMA 9% S/A latex has the highest right-skewed peak,
indicating that the layer has many large pores. However, the peak
of the HEMA 0% S/A latex coating is skewed left, and the peak is lower
than those of the other conditions.

Figure 8 Surface structure of the coating layer.
(a,c) HEMA 0%, and (b,d)
HEMA 9%.

Figure 9 (a) Pore size distribution of the coating layer
and (b) porosity
of the coating layer.

The porosity was investigated
using mercury porosimetry and silicon
saturation (Figure 9b). In both methods, the porosity of coating layer increased with
increasing HEMA amount. That is, the more HEMA there was in the S/A
latex, the more porous was the structure formed in the coating layer,
with larger pores distributed in the structure. Two of porosity data
were similar in its tendency. However, the porosity determined using
silicone oil was higher than that of mercury porosimetry, probably
because the silicon oil saturation method detected the surface dents
as pores.

For visible verification of the structural changes
in the thickness
direction, a cross section of the coating layer was obtained by focused
ion beam microscopy (FIB, Figure 10). Compared with the condition without HEMA, a more
porous and uniform cross section was observed for HEMA 9%. The porosities
of the coating layers with HEMA 0% and HEMA 9% calculated from the
FIB images were 28.61 and 37.05%, respectively. The porosity values
from the image analysis were higher than those obtained from other
methods. In the case of FIB images, the unstained latex binders were
not clearly distinguished from the pores in the coating layer, which
caused overestimation of the pores. Another possible cause lies in
the difference in the measurable ranges. Very small pores, which cannot
be detected as pores in mercury porosimetry or other liquid intrusion
test method, can be detected in the FIB image.21 For instance, pores ranging from 10 to 100 nm were evaluated
in the mercury porosimetry.

Figure 10 Cross section of the coating layer. (a) HEMA
0%, and (b) HEMA 9%.

As shown in Figure 8, there was less
latex film on the coating surface in the high-HEMA
condition. It was shown that HEMA augmented the swelling of the S/A
latex particles and made the coating layer immobilized earlier. Because
the binders in the immobilized layer migrate less, it would be possible
to obtain a coating layer with more uniform latex distribution by
using S/A latex with a HEMA comonomer. In general, increased pore
size and void fraction that accompanies the use of S/A latex with
HEMA comonomer will influence ink absorption. Improved uniformity
of the coating layer will improve the printing uniformity. Also, less
migration of the S/A latex with HEMA is expected to give less print
mottling and increase the mechanical properties of coating layer.
Because a number of quality specifications including optical, physical,
and printing properties should be met for the coated papers, optimization
of the S/A latexes with HEMA comonomer should be made in the future.

2.5 Shrinkage Rate
The shrinkage rate
of the coating layer was investigated based on the coating layer volume.
The volume was derived from the MS-DWS and porosity data. Table 3 presents the volumes
of the coating layer in three conditions. Before drying, all coating
layers had similar volumes, regardless of the HEMA amount. However,
the high-HEMA condition had a larger volume at the first critical
concentration (FCC) because of the early immobilization of the high-HEMA
condition. In other words, the coating layer reached the FCC earlier
because of the particle swelling, and the tendency was maintained
after drying.

Table 3 Volume of the Coating Layer
HEMA (%)	before
drying (cm3/100 g)	at FCC (cm3/100 g)	after drying (cm3/100 g)	
0	64.66	40.32	36.94	
3	64.56	41.17	37.26	
6	64.47	43.08	38.85	
9	64.50	43.41	38.79	
Figure 11 shows
the shrinkage rate of coated paper derived from the volume at the
FCC and after drying. The shrinkage rate increased from 8.4 to 10.6%.
Although the final volume increased with increasing HEMA content,
the shrinkage rate was proportional to the HEMA content. This result
indicates that early immobilization increases coating shrinkage, even
though it gives more porous coating after drying. Greater shrinkage
of the coating after immobilization resulted in lower gloss. According
to Järnström et al.,22 the
gloss of coated paper has a negative relationship with the roughness
of the paper. Even though the S/A latex with a HEMA comonomer gave
a more uniform coating structure, it decreased the gloss of the coating
layer because of greater shrinkage of the coating. This shows that
further study on the optimization of coating structure and coated
paper properties should be carried out.

of the coating layer.

3 Conclusions
This research introduced HEMA as a comonomer for styrene-acrylate
latex binder. It explored the swelling properties of S/A latex particles
caused by the HEMA monomer and their effect on the properties of coating
layer and coated paper. The S/A latex particles swelled increasingly
with the HEMA content in S/A latex. Particularly, the swelling occurred
in the outer part of the S/A latex particles because of the hydrophilic
group present in the outer layer. The swelling and hydrophilicity
caused by HEMA increased the solid-like volumes in the coating layer
and made the coating layer immobilized earlier. Because the coating
components including S/A latex particles interlocked in the earlier
drying stages, high HEMA latex gave more uniform and more porous coating
layer, which provides many advantages in reducing print mottle, improving
picking resistance, and increasing coating uniformity. However, use
of S/A latex with a HEMA comonomer reduced the gloss of coated paper,
which indicated that optimization of HEMA content need to be made
to obtain the target properties.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Four S/A latexes with different
amounts of HEMA were used in this research, provided by LG Chem. Ltd.
(Korea). The HEMA contents of the S/A latexes were 0, 3, 6, and 9
wt % (Table 4). All
monomers including HEMA were charged to the polymerization vessel
and emulsion polymerized. Properties of the S/A latex except the HEMA
content, that is, the particle size, gel content, and glass transition
temperature, were controlled to investigate the effect of HEMA content
more systematically.

All of the coating layers and coated
paper used in this research
were made using the same conditions, that is, the same formulation,
pH, and solid content were employed. The coating color was made with
100 parts per hundred (pph) of pigment, 12 pph of S/A latex, and 0.15
pph of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Finfix 5, CP Kelco, Korea). Ground
calcium carbonate (GCC, Setacarb-HG, Omya, Korea) was used as the
coating pigment. GCC was dispersed in diluted CMC solution, and the
S/A latex binder was added to the dispersion. A stirring time of 20
min was applied after the addition of each component. The total solids
content was 62 wt %, and the pH of the coating color was adjusted
to 9 with sodium hydroxide. After mixing for 20 min, the coating color
was filtered using a 100-mesh wire screen.

4.2 Swelling
of Latex Particles
The degree
of swelling of the S/A latex particles was evaluated based on the
three swelling coefficients following Horský et al.16 The first swelling coefficient was calculated
from the hydrodynamic diameter ratio of S/A latex particles in acidic
and alkaline conditions. The other two swelling coefficients were
obtained from the relative viscosity of S/A latex suspensions using
Mooney’s equation.23

The hydrodynamic
diameters of the S/A latex particles were measured using Zetasizer
Nano ZS (Malvern Instrument, UK). This instrument measures the particle
size by DLS. To evaluate the swelling degree, the S/A latex suspensions
were diluted to 0.01% in pH 4 and pH 9 conditions. The suspensions
were stabilized for 2 days after adjusting the pH and concentration
before the measurement. The swelling coefficient was obtained from
the ratio of the diameters in alkaline and acid conditions according
to eq 1. 1  

The relative viscosity was measured using a glass capillary viscometer
(Cannon-Fenske Routine Viscometer, USA) at 25 °C in several concentrations.
The intrinsic viscosity [η] and critical volume fraction ϕc were obtained from the intercept and slope of the Mooney
equation in eq 2. The
swelling coefficients were defined as the ratio of the intrinsic viscosity
and critical volume fraction in alkaline conditions to the values
in acidic conditions (eqs 3 and 4). Theoretical values rather than experimental
values were used for the acidic conditions because S/A latex aggregates
in acidic conditions. 2   3   4  

The equations
described above provide the hydrodynamic changes
of the latex particle, but they do not provide any information on
the physical changes of the latex. The physical changes of the latex
particles were investigated by TEM (LIBRA 120, Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Latex particles, however, show physical changes at room temperature
by forming films. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the sizes
of the particles while they are in suspension. The S/A latex particles
in alkaline suspension were analyzed by using cryo-TEM (Talos L120C,
FEI, USA) after quick-freezing. The solid content of the S/A latex
suspensions was 0.5 wt % at pH 9. The samples were stabilized for
2 days at room temperature before quick-freezing by Vitrobot (FEI,
USA).

4.3 Dewatering Property and Low-Shear Viscosity
of Coating Color
The dewatering of the coating color was
evaluated with an Åbo Akademi Gravimetric water retention meter
(ÅA-GWR). Ten milliliters of coating color was loaded onto a
membrane filter (mixed cellulose ester membrane filter, pore size
0.2 μm, Advantec), and 1.8 bar of pressure was applied for 60
s. The coating color was dewatered to the blotter paper under the
membrane filter. The dewatering amount was calculated by the weight
difference of blotter papers before and after dewatering, and it was
divided by the dewatering area to obtain the water retention value.

The low-shear viscosity of the coating color was measured by a
Brookfield viscometer (Brookfield DV2Y, USA). All of the measurements
were made using the same containers at room temperature.

4.4 Drying Kinetics of the Coating Layer
The drying kinetics
of the coating layer was investigated by multispeckle-diffusing
wave spectroscopy (MS-DWS; Horus, Formulaction, France) (Figure 1). MS-DWS uses DLS
and analyzes drying dynamics through the Brownian motion of the particles.24,25 A camera without a lens detects speckle images caused by the interference
of backscattered light. At the same time, the dynamics of the particles
are evaluated by the intensity difference between these images. In
MS-DWS, the intensity difference is analyzed by a vectoral distance
(d2) between two images (eq 5). 5  

From the set of speckle images, the
interimage distance between each image and the reference one is plotted
as a function of time. The correlation function has approximately
an exponential shape, and from the correlation function, the SR representing
the dynamics of the particles is obtained. A high SR means the fast
movement of particles. More detailed information on the instrument
and operating principle can be found in literature.20,24,25

Figure 12 illustrates
the measurement scheme. The instrument uses a laser with a 655 nm
wavelength. It can take images with resolutions of 320 × 240
pixels, and the maximum frame rate was 30 images/s. For the measurement,
the wet coating layer was applied to the glass plate using a film-casting
doctor blade. Drying conditions were controlled to have constant temperature
and humidity (23.0 ± 0.5 °C, RH 50 ± 3%). Simultaneously,
the weight change during the process was monitored using an analytical
balance (Radwag, Poland). The resolution of the balance was 0.1 mg.

Figure 12 Scheme
of the drying kinetics measurement.

4.5 Structure of the Coating Layer
The
images of the surface structure were obtained by a field-emission
scanning electron microscope (AURIGA, Carl Zeiss). The pore structure
of the coating layer was investigated using a focused ion beam microscope
(AURIGA, Carl Zeiss) and a mercury porosimeter (AutoPore IV, Micromeritics
Instrument Corp., USA). The coating color was applied to a 100 μm
thick polyethylene terephthalate film using a four-sided gap applicator
and dried at room temperature.

The porosity of the coating layer
was also measured using a mercury porosimeter and by the silicon oil
saturation method. In mercury porosimetry, the porosity was calculated
by the intrusion volume per coating layer volume (eq 6). The diameters of the pores ranged
from 10 to 100 nm, and they were assumed to have a cylindrical shape.
When the porosity was checked with silicon oil, the same film used
in the mercury porosimeter measurement was used as a coating substrate,
but a bar coater was used to apply the coating. 6  

4.6 Shrinkage Rate
The shrinkage rate
of the coating layer was determined from the volumetric data obtained
from the drying kinetics and porosity measurements. First, the volume
of the coating layer before drying was calculated using the coating
color formulation and density of each component. The volume of solids
in the coating layer was obtained from the coating color formulation,
solid content, and density data of each component. Next, the volume
of the coating layer at the immobilization point was obtained from
the total weight of the coating layer at the FCC and the dried coating
layer. The volume of water at the FCC was calculated from the mass
of the coating layer at the FCC and the solid weight of the coating
layer. The volume of the fully dried coating layer was obtained from
the porosity data and the solid volume of the coating layer.
