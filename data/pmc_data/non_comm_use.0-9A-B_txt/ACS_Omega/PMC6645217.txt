Amorphous
calcium carbonate (ACC) stabilized by acidic macromolecules
is a useful material for the development of environmentally friendly
composites. In this study, we synthesized transparent and mechanically
tough ACC-based composite materials by the incorporation of water-dispersible
cellulose derivatives, namely, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and surface-modified
crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs). A solution mixing method
used in the present work proved to be a powerful and efficient method
for the production of mechanically tough and environmentally friendly
materials. Molecular-scale interactions between carboxyl groups and
Ca2+ ions induce homogeneous dispersion of CNFs in the
composites, and this gives composite films with high transparency
and high mechanical properties. The composite films of CMC, CNFs,
and ACC at the mixture ratios of 40, 40, and 20 wt %, showed high
mechanical properties of 15.8 ± 0.93 GPa for the Young’s
modulus and 268 ± 20 MPa for the tensile strength. These designed
materials that are based on ACC may open up new opportunities in many
fields in applications that require the use of environmentally friendly,
biodegradable, mechanically tough, and transparent composite materials.

Introduction
Material manufacturing
with environmentally friendly resources
is important because of the rising demands for sustainability.1−9 Material scientists can be inspired by nature in the design of new
environmentally friendly materials.10−16 In particular, biomineralization-inspired materials have attracted
much attention because of the formation of nano- to centimeter-scale
controlled hierarchical hybrid structures under mild conditions. Such
biomineralization-inspired materials play important roles and bring
a new concept into the fields of material syntheses.17−32 Various approaches to mimicking such layered composite structures
have been reported.11,12,30−32 Biominerals consist of organic matrices, for example,
polysaccharides such as chitin and cellulose, and inorganic components
such as CaCO3, calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, and silicate.1,2 These components are all considered to be environmentally friendly
in terms of materials science and technology. For CaCO3-based materials, the nacre of shells is a representative composite.
It forms mechanically tough organic/inorganic layered structures under
ambient conditions. This structure is based on the aragonite phase.
These materials are hard and nontransparent composites because the
ratio of organic to inorganic matter is 5 to 95 wt %. In contrast,
the exoskeletons of crustaceans are more flexible and more transparent
because of the higher contents of organic substances. They consist
of hydrated amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), proteins, and chitin
fibers. Our intention here is to develop flexible, tough, and transparent
composites by mimicking the exoskeletons of crustaceans.

In
nature, ACC is a useful transient state of crystalline phases
such as calcite and aragonite.33−37 In the preparation of synthetic CaCO3-based materials,
ACC has been used to control the morphologies of the resultant crystalline
phases.38,39 Recently, we also used colloidal ACC for
the preparation of liquid crystal nanorods.40 Composites based on stable ACC are expected to be transparent and
mechanically tough in all directions.14,41 We found that
an acidic polymer, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), acts as a stabilizer
for ACC, providing ACC-based composites that have significant stability
for years under ambient conditions.14,41 We developed
stable ACC-based transparent composites in a previous study.41 These composites were brittle in the bulk state,
but stable thin-film coatings were achieved.41 In our previous paper,14 we described
that we introduced cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) with acidic groups
into these materials, which enabled the preparation of mechanically
stable thin-film materials.14 These materials
were prepared by immersion of bacterial cellulose into an ACC colloidal
solution.14 The preparation of transparent
films by using biobased materials such as CNFs and chitin has attracted
attention.42−46 However, only a few studies of the introduction of ACC into these
CNF-based materials have been reported.14,29 Transparent,
mechanically tough, and environmentally friendly composite materials
are expected to contribute significantly to the sustainable development
of composites in the field of material engineering.

Here, we
describe a new approach to the development of mechanically
tough and transparent ACC-based composite materials containing cellulose
derivatives. The method involves tuning the compatibilities among
four components, namely, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), which interacts
with calcium ions, CNFs, and ACC/PAA at the molecular- and nanoscale-levels
(Figure 1). We also
discuss the effects of the amount of ACC incorporated into the cellulose
matrices on the transparency and mechanical properties.

biomimetic structures.

Results and Discussion
Mechanically Tough and Transparent Composite
Films of CMC, CNF,
and ACC
Transparent cellulose-based ACC composite materials
were obtained using CMC as an organic matrix. CMC was expected to
provide fundamental physical properties to the composites. Surface-carboxylated
CNFs with 2,2,6,6-(tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) were introduced
into the composites to enhance the mechanical properties of the transparent
films.

CMC, CNFs, and ACC stabilized by PAA were homogeneously
dispersed in aqueous solution. The dimension of the TEMPO-oxidized
CNFs was estimated to be ca. 20 nm in diameter and micrometer-scaled
length with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure S1). The homogeneous dispersion of CNFs with negative
surface charges is crucial in the formation of homogeneous structures
comprising four components, that is, CMC, CNFs, and ACC including
PAA. Transparent thin films were obtained by drying a mixed solution
of the four components in an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)
case. The composition of the prepared CMC/CNF/ACC composite films
is shown in Table 1.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the CMC/CNF/ACC composite
films show no peaks attributable to CaCO3 crystalline phases
(Figure 2), indicating
high stability of ACC under ambient conditions. A peak from the ACC
phase appears in the IR spectra of the CMC/CNF/ACC composite films
(Figure 3). The Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) absorption peak at 866 cm–1, which
is attributed to the v2 out-of-plane bending
of CO32–, confirms the presence of ACC
in the hybrid.40 These results suggest
that CNF incorporation into the composites by the solution mixing
method does not disturb the homogeneous structures of the cellulose
derivatives and ACC. It should be noted that the four components of
the CMC/CNF/ACC composite films have high transparencies (Figure 4). CNF incorporation
does not significantly reduce the transparency of the composite thin
films in the visible-light region. Homogeneous composite films of
cellulose derivatives and ACC were expected to have high transparency
because the refractive indices ñ of CaCO3 and cellulose are similar (CaCO3ñ ≈ 1.58, cellulose ñ ≈ 1.56–1.60).47−49 The transparency remains high at above 80% transmittance even with
the introduction of 30 wt % ACC into the polymer. Highly transparent
composite materials were obtained because the refractive indices of
cellulose and ACC are similar.

The composite structures of the CMC/CNF/ACC films were examined
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the fracture
surface of the CMC/CNF/ACC composites containing 30 wt % ACC (Figure 5a, left). Elemental
analyses with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were also
conducted (Figure 5a, right). The SEM image shows homogeneous structures without aggregation
of any of the components (Figure 5a, left). EDX mapping of the composites shows homogeneous
distribution of Ca atoms in the composite film (Figure 5a, right). These results suggest that no
domain boundaries are formed at macroscale in the composite films.
Because of this homogeneous structure, the composite films exhibit
no light scattering and high transparency. The similarity between
the refractive indices of ACC and cellulose derivatives contributes
to the suppression of light scattering.

The transparent CMC/CNF/ACC composites
prepared by a solution mixing
method in this study gave high mechanical performances. The mechanical
properties of the four-component films were enhanced by ACC incorporation. Figure 6 presents the stress–strain
curves for the composite films containing various amounts of ACC.
A summary of mechanical properties is given in Table 2. The CMC/CNF composite films had a Young’s
modulus and tensile strength of 10.7 ± 1.2 GPa and 240 ±
28 MPa, respectively. The incorporation of 20 wt % ACC increased these
values to 15.8 ± 0.93 GPa for the Young’s modulus and
268 ± 20 MPa for the tensile strength. In these composites, CaCO3, particularly Ca2+ ions serve as a cross-linking
agent because of the ionic interactions with the carboxylate groups
in CMC, CNFs, and PAA. The effects of these ionic interactions based
on Ca2+ molecular interactions enhance the mechanical properties
of the CMC/CNF/ACC composite films. In contrast, incorporation of
30 wt % ACC increased the Young’s modulus to 18.0 ± 1.7
GPa and decreased the mechanical strength to 133 ± 2.4 MPa. This
deterioration in the mechanical strength is presumably caused by the
segregation of CMC/CNF and ACC domains in the CMC/CNF/ACC composite
films. This observation suggests that a redundant amount of ACC results
in mechanically weak materials because of the nature of ACC. These
results show that ACC addition is an efficient tool for increasing
the Young’s modulus, although an excess of ACC leads to the
formation of fragile composites.

The effects of ACC incorporation on the mechanical performance
were studied by nanoindentation hardness testing (Table 3 and Figure S2). An increase in the amount of ACC in the CMC/CNF/ACC composites
up to 30 wt % of ACC enhanced the modulus and hardness of the composite
films. These results suggest that an appropriate amount of ACC interacting
with the polymer fulfills the space between the organic matrices.

Mechanically tough transparent materials were achieved for the
CMC/CNF/ACC composites. CMC plays key roles in the formation of homogeneous
mixtures of CNFs and ACC in the solution mixing method. This method
for synthesizing four-component composite films is an energy-efficient
procedure for producing transparent composite films with sufficient
tensile strength and indentation hardness. ACC has a key effect on
the optical properties such as high transparency with tensile strength
and hardness.

Comparison of Composites in the Presence
and Absence of CNF
Transparent composite thin films composed
of CMC and ACC, without
CNFs, were prepared with ACC amounts, that is, 13, 20, and 29 wt %,
similar to those in the CMC/CNF/ACC composites. FT-IR spectroscopy
and XRD (Figures S3 and S4) confirmed that
mixing of ACC/PAA and CMC solutions provided transparent amorphous
CMC/ACC composite films. CMC and ACC/PAA colloids were homogeneously
mixed by the solution mixing method, which was confirmed with the
EDX analysis (Figure S5). The prepared
CMC/ACC composite films showed high transparency in the wavelength
region 300–800 nm (Figure S6). In
contrast, UV–vis spectra of the CMC/CNF/ACC composites showed
the light scattering at a wavelength of around 300 nm (Figure 4). This is caused by submicrometer-sized
CNFs in the composite films. The transparencies in the visible-light
region for the CNF-containing composites were comparable to those
of composite films without CNF incorporation.

Mechanical tests
were performed on CMC/ACC, and the mechanical properties were compared
with those of the CMC/CNF/ACC composites. The dashed lines in Figure 6 show the results
of tensile tests on the composite thin films containing 13, 20, and
29 wt % ACC in the CMC matrix, without CNFs. A summary of the mechanical
properties of the composite films is given in Table 2. The effects of ACC incorporation on the
mechanical properties of the CMC/ACC composites were similar to those
in the case of CMC/CNF/ACC composites (Table 2). With respect to the effects of CNFs on
the mechanical properties, it is clear that replacement of half of
the CMC component in the CNF, that is, from 100/0/0 (CMC/CNF/ACC)
to 50/50/0 (CMC/CNF/ACC), increased the Young’s modulus three-fold
and doubled the tensile strength (Table 2). For the composite films containing ACC,
CNF replacement of half of the CMC component enhanced the mechanical
strength. The incorporation of CNFs increased the Young’s modulus
and tensile strength values. Even in the presence of 30 wt % ACC,
the replacement of CMC by CNFs, that is, from 71/0/29 (CMC/CNF/ACC)
to 35/35/30 (CMC/CNF/ACC), increased both the Young’s modulus
and tensile strength ca. 1.5 times (Table 2). Although tensile strengths of the composite
films without CNF incorporation were lower than those of the CMC/CNF/ACC
composites, the elongation properties of CMC/ACC were higher than
those of the CNF-containing composites. These results indicate that
CNF introduction reduces elasticity and increases resistance to stretching.

The effects of CNFs on the mechanical properties were also examined
by performing nanoindentation tests (Figure 7). A comparison of the indentation moduli
and hardness values of 80/0/20 (CMC/CNF/ACC) and 40/40/20 (CMC/CNF/ACC)
shows that CNF replacement of half of the CMC enhances the stiffness
of the composite films (Tables 3 and 4). The incorporation of CNFs
into CMC/ACC as a reinforcing material component showed significant
effects on the mechanical strength of the composite.

percentages of ACC.

It is demonstrated that the solution mixing method used in this
study enables easy tuning of CMC/CNF/ACC content ratios, and these
determine the mechanical properties of the composite films. The brief
preparation process is advantageous for the development of environmentally
friendly organic/inorganic composite materials with transparency and
modulated mechanical performances. Zhu and his co-workers demonstrate
that hot pressing of wood slices is a fast preparation method of cellulose-based
films with high transparency of 90% and tensile strength of 150 MPa.50 However, this useful method has not been used
for the formation of composites with inorganic components, which can
provide desired properties to cellulose-based films.

The results
in the present study also suggest that the ACC incorporation
into cellulose-based materials is an effective way to enhance the
values of tensile strength and Young’s modulus with maintaining
high transparency and environmental friendliness. Although other inorganic
components including clays have been utilized as additives to improve
mechanical strength, the transparency at 600 nm is decreased to 40–80%.51−56 The present CMC/CNF/ACC composite films exhibit around 90% of transparency
at 600 nm, which is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art composite
films based on CNFs with inorganic components.57−59 In addition
to the high transparency, 40/40/20 (CMC/CNF/ACC) showed 260 ±
20 MPa tensile strength and 15.8 ± 0.93 GPa Young’s modulus,
which are comparable to other tailor-made composite films based on
CNFs.51−53,58,59

There are only a couple of reports on the development of CNF/ACC
composite materials,14,29 although ACC is a suitable component
for the composite formation with CNFs because of the similar refractive
index to cellulose materials. Gebauer et al. showed that the CNF/ACC
coatings show high transparency.29 The
composite coatings show 0.27–0.41 GPa of indentation hardness,
which is lower than the present CMC/CNF/ACC materials, and the formation
of self-standing films has not been achieved.29 To the best of our knowledge, only our previous report shows the
formation of self-standing flexible CNF/ACC composite films.14 In our previous report on transparent composites
based on ACC and bacterial cellulose, an ACC colloidal suspension
was percolated into the solid three-dimensional network of a cellulose
hydrogel matrix. In the present report, we have shown advantages of
using a water-dispersible polymeric crystalline cellulose derivative
of CNFs as a matrix for mechanically tough composite films with high
transparency and homogeneously dispersed ACC. For the materials obtained
by the present method, molecular-scale interactions between cellulose
derivatives and ACC through the intermolecular forces between carboxylate
groups and Ca2+ ions enhance the stiffness of the flexible
composite films. The Young’s moduli of the CMC/CNF/ACC and
CMC/ACC composite films are higher than those of composites based
on the surface-carboxylated bacterial cellulose and ACC, 7.3 ±
0.5 GPa.14 The tensile strengths of the
composites in the present study are comparable to those of the composites
in our previous study.14

The mechanical
properties of the materials prepared in the present
study are comparable to those of transparent composite films based
on cellulose microfibrils and a clay mineral.51−53,59 Structural control of the composite film is an effective
approach to enhancement of mechanical properties. Alignment of CNFs
is an efficient technique for enhancing the mechanical properties.43,60 Furthermore, the chiral structures in the hard tissues of living
organisms provide excellent mechanical toughness.5,61 Further
improvements in processing could lead to the development of transparent
composite films, with enhanced mechanical properties, based on abundant
natural resources.

Conclusions
We have developed transparent
composite films composed of the cellulose
derivatives, CMC and CNFs, and ACC, inspired by the composite structures
in biominerals. Preparation of composite materials consisting of environmentally
abundant materials and eco-friendly minerals was achieved with an
energy-efficient procedure. The molecular-scale interactions between
CMC and ACC endow the composite films with stiffness and hardness.
The carboxylate groups of CMC, CNFs, and ACC generate electrostatic
repulsion forces, which inhibit aggregation of two components. The
four components form homogeneously dispersed structures in the composite
film, leading to high mechanical strength and high transparency. Our
biomineralization-inspired approaches can be applied for the formation
of various organic/inorganic composite materials.12,62,63 For example, calcium phosphate-based composite
materials that have a potential for applications in a wide range of
fields such as biomedical may be developed.12,24,64 The present study promises that mimicking
biomimetic structures could lead to the development of hard, strong,
and transparent materials from abundant natural resources.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of the CMC Solution
Dried sodium CMC powder
(Mw = 100 000; etherification degree
= 4 mmol g–1; Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) was stirred in water for 1 day at room temperature for
the preparation of 5 wt % aqueous solution. The solution containing
partially dissolved CMC was filtered to remove aggregated CMC chunks.
The resultant CMC solution was dialyzed against distilled water to
remove residual salts. The weight percentage of CMC in the solution
was determined by gravimetric analysis.

Preparation of the ACC/PAA
Precursor Solution
A colloidal
suspension of the ACC/PAA precursor was prepared according to our
previously reported method.41 Anhydrous
calcium chloride (CaCl2) (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan)
was added to an aqueous solution of PAA (Mw = 1.8 × 103; Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to prepare
a 0.1 M CaCl2 solution containing 7.2 × 10–1 wt % PAA. An equal volume of a 0.1 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) solution was added
to the CaCl2/PAA solution. After reaction for 1 h, the
ACC colloid was collected and washed by centrifugation. All chemical
reagents were used without further purification.

Preparation
of the CMC/CNF/ACC Composite Material
TEMPO-mediated
oxidized CNFs (oxidization degree = 0.3 mmol g–1; Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were homogeneously
dispersed in deionized water at 0.5 wt %. The requisite ratios and
amounts of CNFs and purified CMC were mixed with the purified ACC
colloidal solution. After the four components were evenly dispersed
and mixed, the solution was poured into a 3 cm × 6 cm ABS case
and dried in an oven at 25 °C to obtain a freestanding film with
the thickness of ca. 50 μm.

Preparation of the CMC/ACC
Composite Material
The requisite
amount of the purified CMC solution was homogeneously mixed with the
ACC colloidal suspension. The prepared homogeneous dispersion was
dried in an oven at 25 °C to form a transparent thin composite
film.

Characterization
FT-IR spectroscopy was performed with
a JASCO FT/IR-6100 spectrometer by the KBr method. The XRD patterns
of the samples were recorded with Rigaku Smartlab (Rigaku, Tokyo,
Japan) equipped with a monochromator-filtered Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm) source at 40 kV and 40 mA. The UV–vis
transmittance spectra were recorded with a JASCO V-670 (JASCO, Tokyo,
Japan) spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere unit (ISN-800T).
The film and fracture surfaces were observed by SEM (Hitachi S-4700
scanning electron microscope, Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan).
The SEM samples were coated with platinum, using a Hitachi E-1030
ion sputterer, before the SEM observations. EDX was performed at 10
kV with the Hitachi S-4700 SEM and a Horiba EMAX-7000 (Horiba, Kyoto,
Japan) instrument. TEM was conducted with JEM-2010HC (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) operated at 200 kV. The tensile strength tests were performed
with a Shimadzu EZ-TEST instrument (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a
500 N load cell. Rectangular specimens of width 5 mm and length 30
mm were prepared from the samples, and the tensile tests were conducted
at a rate of 0.5 mm/min and a span length of 10 mm. The slope of the
linear region of the stress–strain curve was used to determine
the Young’s modulus (E). To avoid the effects
of moisture on the mechanical properties, the composite films were
dried at 60 °C for 2 h before the tensile tests. The nanoindentation
hardness was determined with a Shimadzu DUH-211SR (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) instrument equipped with a Berkovich-shaped diamond tip. The
force applied to the samples was 1 mN.
