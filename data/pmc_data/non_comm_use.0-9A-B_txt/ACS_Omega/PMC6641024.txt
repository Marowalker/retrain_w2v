We
investigated the influence of two anionic surfactants, namely,
sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium decyl sulfate, on acrylamide-based
microgels consisting of N-n-propylacrylamide.
In this context, the main focus was on the influence of surfactant
addition on the size of the microgels. The surfactant was added to
the reaction mixture before or during the polymerization at different
points in time. Microgels were characterized via photon correlation
spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. All results were compared
to those for other more common acrylamide-based microgels consisting
of N-isopropylacrylamide and N-isopropylmethacrylamide.
A significant difference between the three microgels and a strong
dependence on the surface activity of the surfactant was found.

==== Body
Introduction
Several acrylamide-based microgels exhibit
changes in size triggered
by external stimuli such as temperature and pH, for instance. This
interesting behavior granted them the name smart microgels.1−5 Because of their stimulus response, they are considered in a lot
of different applications, ranging from the biomedical field6−9 to photonics,10−15 surface modification,16,17 and as nanoparticle
containers18,19 or for drug uptake and release.20,21 More detailed information can be found in recent reviews.22−25

Especially, in the context of applications concerning optical
properties
of hybrid systems, it is important to control and tune the size of
the microgels during the synthesis. A very distinguished example for
this
was given by Serpe et al. They described the design of etalons from
gold-coated substrates.26 Additionally,
tuning the particle size of acrylamide microgels broadens their scope
of applicability.2 In 1993, Pelton et al.
have shown how the size of the microgels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) can be influenced by the addition
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).27 For
particles based on poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide)
(PNIPMAM), the influence of several surfactants on the size of the
obtained colloidal microgels was studied by von Nessen et al.28 Recently, we started to study microgels based
on the monomer N-n-propylacrylamide29,30 (NnPAM). This monomer yields microgels that show a very sharp and
steep change in size upon changes in temperature30 and might therefore be used for making more precise sensors
compared to those from the other mentioned systems.
From a physical chemistry point of view, this steep change in size
might indicate a discontinuous phase transition in these microgels.
However, this issue will be addressed in a different work. Moreover,
NnPAM can be copolymerized with NIPMAM, leading to a tunability of
the phase transition temperature between 21 °C (lower critical
solution temperature (LCST) of PNnPAM) and 44 °C (LCST of PNIPMAM).29 Because of these promising properties, it is
of interest to achieve size control also in the synthesis of these
non-NIPAM-based microgels. One of the most prominent anionic surfactants
for microgel synthesis is SDS. The main aim of this study was the
investigation of the influence of SDS on the synthesis of NnPAM microgels.
Therefore, we synthesized NnPAM microgels in the presence of different
amounts of SDS. Moreover, we also used sodium decyl sulfate (SDeS),
aiming at scrutinizing changes in the obtained particle properties
caused by the different lengths of the alkyl chain of the surfactant.
The results for PNnPAM microgels are compared to the data for PNIPAM
and PNIPMAM particles.

Results and Discussion
Influence of Surfactant
on the Particle Size
We used
photon correlation spectroscopy to study the swelling behavior and
the size of PNnPAM microgels prepared in the presence of increasing
amounts of SDS between 0 and 2.08 mM. All SDS concentrations were
far below the bulk critical micelle concentration (cmc) value of SDS.31 These results were subsequently compared to
the behavior of PNIPAM and PNIPMAM microgels.

Figure 1 shows some exemplary swelling
curves of the obtained PNnPAM microgels. These swelling curves are
very similar to those of other responsive microgels,28,32 but in contrast, the transition is very steep and sharp. Especially,
the PNnPAM microgels synthesized without surfactant show a very rapid
change in the hydrodynamic radius. The broadening of phase transition
for higher SDS concentrations could indicate a different cross-linker
distribution. However, PNnPAM microgels might exhibit a discontinuous
phase transition. Such a behavior is not yet observed in other microgels.

Figure 1 Swelling
curves of PNnPAM microgels synthesized in the presence of different
SDS concentrations (squares, 0 mM; circles, 0.17 mM; triangles, 0.69
mM; and diamonds, 2.08 mM).

We observed a decrease in particle radius from 150 to 30
nm in
the collapsed state (see Figure 2). The relation between PNnPAM particle size and surfactant
concentration was similar to the results previously published for
PNIPAM and PNIPMAM microgels,27,28 with a remarkably great
difference in the reduction of the hydrodynamic radius. We synthesized
PNIPAM and PNIPMAM microgels under identical conditions to compare
the influence of SDS on the particle size in the collapsed state.

Figure 2 Hydrodynamic
radius of fully collapsed PNIPMAM (squares), PNIPAM
(circles), and PNnPAM (triangles) microgels as a function of SDS concentration
present during the microgel synthesis. The hydrodynamic radius was
measured and calculated via angle-dependent photon correlation spectroscopy.

Whereas the radius of PNnPAM microgels
decreased by around 81%
upon addition of increasing amounts of SDS, the size reduction for
PNIPAM microgels was 70%. The size reduction for PNIPMAM microgels
was only about 53%. In addition, it should be noted that for SDS concentrations
of 0.69 and 2.08 mM PNnPAM nanogels were obtained despite the fact
that the “classical” Pelton synthesis was used and no
functionalized comonomers were added.

We assume that the structural
difference between
the side chains of PNIPAM, PNIPMAM, and PNnPAM gives rise to a more
pronounced influence of the surfactant on the stabilization of the
precursor particles during an early stage of microgel formation. Due
to the higher hydrophobicity of small PNnPAM oligomer chains compared
to that of PNIPAM, the stabilization of the mentioned precursors starts
at lower chain lengths of the oligomers. Therefore, the number of
growing particles in the early stage of the process is probably substantially
higher for PNnPAM compared to that for PNIPAM and PNIPMAM microgels.
Consequently, the resulting particles are smaller. This assumption
is confirmed when the influence of smaller amounts of surfactant is
studied. The effect of SDS is modest for PNIPAM microgels at low concentrations,
for example, 0.17 mM, whereas PNnPAM microgels become significantly
smaller in the presence of 0.17 mM SDS.

Given the results for
the influence of SDS on the hydrodynamic
radius of PNnPAM microgels, we expected the same trend for the addition
of SDeS to the microgel reaction mixture. The results are plotted
in Figure 3. The influence
of SDeS on the particle size was, taking the lower surface activity
of SDeS into account, equal to the effect of SDS addition. The inferior
surface activity of SDeS can be quantified by comparing the cmc of
SDeS with that of SDS
(33 vs 8.3 mM).31 It was not possible to
normalize the particle size when the surfactant concentrations are
divided by the cmc, though. The reason for this is that the addition
of large amounts of SDeS, which lead to particles comparable in size
with the particles synthesized with the rather moderate SDS concentrations,
causes a substantially higher ionic strength in the batch synthesis.
This also influences the particle size, as it leads to a higher aggregation
rate in the early synthesis phase. Therefore, we obtain smaller particles
when SDS is used as a surfactant in emulsion polymerization.

the synthesis: SDS (filled symbols) and SDeS (hollow symbols).

Influence of the Moment
of Surfactant Addition
Up to
this point, the presented results focused on the influence of anionic
surfactants on the formation and swelling behaviors if the surfactant
is added before the initiation of polymerization.

However, it
is well known that the process of microgel formation has different
steps. It is still under investigation at which stage of microgel
formation the surfactant has the greatest influence. Two possibilities
appear to be most likely. The first possibility is the stabilization
of early precursor particles as mentioned above due to the surface
activity of anionic surfactants. The second possibility is the action
of a surfactant at a later stage of the reaction, where the surfactant
molecules influence the interfacial tension between the growing microgel
particles and the monomer solution and control the incorporation of
monomer units and small oligomer chains. We investigated these phenomena
by adding SDS during the synthesis of PNnPAM at different points in
time. As shown before,30 NnPAM has a polymerization
velocity comparable to that of NIPAM.33 The particle formation seems to be finished after approximately
20 min. Therefore, we choose the following points in time for the
addition of SDS during the synthesis: 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 210, 300,
and 900 s.

The resulting particle dispersions were investigated
by angle-dependent
photon correlation spectroscopy. The averaged relaxation rates, Γ,
which were obtained for the eight different synthesis batches, are
plotted versus the square of the magnitude of the scattering vector, q, in Figure 4. For a system with only one population of particles in solution,
a linear dependence between Γ and q2 should be detected (see eq 2). Even for the sample in which SDS was added 15 s after initiation,
a slight deviation from the expected linear dependence is observed.
This effect increases for the following points in time, and the maximal
deviation is reached when SDS is added 210 s after starting the polymerization.
Hence, it is evident that the addition time of SDS has a drastic influence
on the obtained results. Addition of SDS after 300 and 900 s seems
to have a minor influence on the resulting particles compared to that
at the previous points in time. We conclude that the influence of
SDS during the aggregation phase in the early synthesis procedure
is more important than the influence of the surface tension during
the growth of the collapsed microgel particles.

Figure 4 Relaxation rates of PNnPAM
microgels against the square of the
magnitude of the scattering vector. The microgels were synthesized
with SDS addition to the proceeding reaction after the mentioned times.

The influence of SDS is very pronounced
for the addition time points
from 30 up to 210 s as during this period initiation and oligomer
formation occur and precursor particles are formed. SDS stabilizes
the oligomers to new precursor particles at lower chain lengths and
also the precursor particles that were formed before the surfactant
addition because of a high surface charge.
Therefore, we expect two types of particles in the reaction mixture
differing in size. A small particle species, representing the precursors
that were formed after the addition of SDS at lower chain lengths,
and a large particle species, representing the precursors that were
formed before the SDS addition and were stabilized by SDS after their
collapse. Concerning the time point of SDS addition, the fraction
of the second particle species should be higher when the interval
between initiation and SDS addition is increased. To verify this assumption,
we used atomic force microscopy (AFM). As an example, Figure 5 shows the AFM height profiles
for the representative addition times 60, 120, and 300 s. The obtained
results confirm the idea that addition of SDS at different time points
during the synthesis leads to the formation of two particle species,
as we obtain two noticeably different particle sizes in the AFM images
for the addition times of 60 and 120 s. The nucleation phase seems
to have been completed early in the synthesis process, as there is
only one species left in the AFM images of the PNnPAM microgels with
an addition time of 300 s.

Figure 5 AFM images of PNnPAM microgels synthesized with
SDS addition after
60 s (top), 120 s (middle), and 300 s (bottom). Additionally, the
respective height profiles of the measured particles (denoted z-value) are given as a function of the measured x direction. The images were recorded in tapping mode.

The data clearly reveal the importance
of SDS addition during the
nucleation process of the PNnPAM microgel synthesis. The size distribution
of the resulting particles is controlled by the time interval between
initiation of the reaction and SDS addition. To investigate the influence
of SDS on the secondary particle growth later during the synthesis
process, we analyzed the size of the second particle species, which
seems to be formed before SDS has a crucial influence on particle
nucleation. The particle size of these microgels was extracted from
the height profiles of the AFM measurements and can be compared to
the particle sizes obtained from an analogous surfactant-free synthesis. Figure 6 shows the results
we obtained for SDS addition during the synthesis. Clearly, the interfacial
tension of the growing particles plays an important role for the particle
size as well. The particle size of PNnPAM microgels obtained upon
addition of SDS is substantially
smaller compared to that of the particles obtained by surfactant-free
synthesis (solid line in Figure 6).
After an addition time of 120 s, a plateau is reached. Even if the
particle nucleation phase has been completed before the addition of
SDS, the particle size is only about one-third of the size that the
particles have when no SDS is added during the polymerization.

Figure 6 Particle
size of PNnPAM microgels that were synthesized by adding
SDS during the synthesis at the points in time given on the t axis. The particle sizes were obtained from AFM height
profiles as shown in Figure 5.

A possible explanation for the
limit in size might be the assembly
of surfactant molecules on the microgel surface or in the microgel
(see Supporting Information). The surface
charge of the growing particles is increased, and small oligomer chains
and monomers cannot be adsorbed onto the particles.

Therefore,
significant amounts of water-soluble, small polymers
are produced as side products, by chain termination reactions. These
small polymer chains were not found to precipitate during the reaction.
The resulting water-soluble polymers can be analyzed during the purification
process by a gravimetrical determination of the mass of PNnPAM in
the supernatant of the first centrifugation cycle. Compared to that
in
PNIPAM, in the reaction mixture of the PNnPAM particles a higher amount
of water-soluble un-crosslinked polymer is present at the end of the
synthesis. This is in accordance with the results we obtained for
the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) shift and the particle
size because the interaction of surfactant molecules and microgel
particles is stronger for PNnPAM. Consequently, the influence of SDS
on the size of PNIPAM particles after the nucleation phase seems to
be less pronounced or even does not exist.

To confirm our observations,
we studied the influence of SDS and
SDeS on the VPTT of premade microgels.34−36 The VPTT of the purified
particles changes upon addition of anionic surfactant.35 These changes can be described by a master curve,
which we obtained by normalization of VPTT data by the surfactant
cmc (see Supporting Information).

Experimental
Section
Materials
NIPAM (97%; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany)
and NIPMAM (97%; Sigma-Aldrich Munich, Germany) were recrystallized
from n-hexane. Acryloylchloride (98%; Sigma-Aldrich
Munich, Germany), n-propylamine (99%, Fluka; Buchs,
Switzerland), triethylamine (99%; Grüssing, Filsum, Germany),
dichloromethane (p.A.), ammonium persulfate (≥98%; Sigma-Aldrich
Munich, Germany), N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(99%; Sigma-Aldrich Munich, Germany), SDS (≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich
Munich, Germany), and SDeS (≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich Munich, Germany)
were used without purification. Water was purified using an Arium
pro VF system (Satorius Stedim Systems GmbH, Göttingen, Germany).
The synthesis of NnPAM was described elsewhere.29,30,37

Synthesis of Microgels
All microgels
were synthesized
via precipitation polymerization following the first published PNIPAM
microgel synthesis.38 All syntheses were
performed in a 250 mL three-neck flask equipped with a reflux condenser,
mechanical stirrer, and a nitrogen inlet. The respective monomers
(total amount, 11.55 mmol) and the cross-linker (N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), 0.6 mmol, 5.4 mol %) were
dissolved in 150 mL purified water. After heating up to 70 °C,
the solution was purged with nitrogen for 1 h. The respective surfactant
was added 10 min before the initiation of polymerization. In the case
of SDS, concentrations of 0, 0.17, 0.35, 0.69, 1.11, 1.68, and 2.08
mM were used. The employed SDeS concentrations in the synthesis were
1.11, 3.75, 7.5, and 12.5 mM. Furthermore, samples were prepared,
in which SDS was added shortly after the initiation. The exact addition
times were 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 210, 300, and 900 s. After the initiation,
the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at 70 °C, then cooled
to room temperature, and stirred overnight.

The resulting microgels
were cleaned by five consecutive centrifugation, decantation, and
redispersion cycles using purified water. After the first centrifugation
cycle, the supernatant of each synthesis batch was dried and the remaining
mass was analyzed gravimetrically.

PCS Measurements
Particle sizes were determined using
photon correlation spectroscopy applied to highly diluted samples
(c ≤ 0.001 wt %).

Measurements of the
particle size as a function of temperature were performed using a
diode laser (wave length, λ = 661.4 nm; Toptica Photonics, Graefelfing,
Germany) and an ALV-6010 multiple-τ-correlator (ALV-GmbH, Langen,
Germany). We used a scattering angle of 60° to avoid the observation
of internal contributions. At higher scattering angles, one may also
approach the form factor minimum, which is typically in the range
of 90° for microgels. The scattered light was collected by a
single-mode fiber connected to the photomultiplier tubes of an ALV
detection unit, and the temperature was controlled by a thermostated
decaline bath. At each temperature, the samples were allowed to equilibrate
for 20 min.

The hydrodynamic radii in the collapsed state were
determined via
angle-dependent PCS measurements with an ALV goniometer setup using
an argon ion laser (λ = 514.5 nm; Spectra Physics 2017, Darmstadt,
Germany) operated with a constant output power and an ALV-5000/E multiple-τ-digital
correlator (ALV-GmbH, Langen, Germany).

In all cases, the obtained
time-correlation functions of the scattered
intensity were converted into field correlation functions, g1(t), using the SIEGERT relation.

The different g1(t) curves were subsequently analyzed using inverse Laplace transformations
by means of CONTIN.39 This is based on
the following description of g1(t). 1  Hence, Laplace inversion yields the relaxation
rate distribution G(Γ) and average relaxation
rate Γ̅. The average relaxation rate, Γ̅,
can be plotted versus q2, leading to a
linear dependence with the translational diffusion coefficient as
slope. 2  The magnitude of
the scattering vector, q, can be described by  with refractive index n of the solvent and scattering angle θ.

Deviations from
the linear behavior might indicate additional dynamic
contributions to the decay of g1(t) curves by several different particle species, rotation,
or internal modes, for instance.40

AFM
AFM measurements were performed on a nanoscope
III microscope (Digital Instruments, now Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany)
at room temperature in tapping mode. The cantilevers (Tap300 Al-G;
Budget Sensors, Innovative Solutions Bulgaria Ltd., Sofia, Bulgaria)
had a radius of ≤10 nm, a frequency of 300 kHz, and a spring
constant of 40 N/m. For sample preparation, a silicon wafer (Siegert
Wafer GmbH, Aachen, Germany) was coated with 50 μL of a diluted
microgel suspension and dried at room temperature in the air.

Conclusions
This study shows the influence of anionic surfactants on the precipitation
polymerization process of PNnPAM microgels. In the first part, we
focused on the particle size. Good control of the PNnPAM particle
size was achieved by changing the SDS or SDeS concentrations. At high
amounts of surfactants, nanogels were obtained. The results were compared
to the data obtained for homologous microgels based on PNIPAM and
PNIPMAM. We found that the influence of anionic surfactants on the
formation of PNnPAM microgels is stronger than for PNIPAM and PNIPMAM
particles. This can be explained by the very strong interaction between
the amphiphilic surfactant molecules and the PNnPAM particles. In
the early reaction phase, smaller particles with a substantially lower
surface charge can be stabilized. In addition, there is a significant
interaction between SDS and the growing particles during the secondary
growth phase that limits the size of PNnPAM microgels. The difference
between the n-propyl group and the isopropyl group
in the side chains seems to have a crucial influence on the hydrophobicity
of the resulting particles. Not only the chemical structure of the
monomers but also the chain length of the anionic surfactant and hence
the strength of surface activity play an important role in the interaction
between the surfactant and the microgel during and after the synthesis.
