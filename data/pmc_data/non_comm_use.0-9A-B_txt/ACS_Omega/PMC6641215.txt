Generating
syngas (H2 and CO mixture) from electrochemically
reduced CO2 in an aqueous solution is one of the sustainable
strategies utilizing atmospheric CO2 in value-added products.
However, a conventional single-component metal catalyst, such as Ag,
Au, or Zn, exhibits potential-dependent CO2 reduction selectivity,
which could result in temporal variation of syngas composition and
limit its use in large-scale electrochemical syngas production. Herein,
we demonstrate the use of Ag nanowire (NW)/porous carbon sheet composite
catalysts in the generation of syngas with tunable H2/CO
ratios having a large potential window to resist power fluctuation.
These Ag NW/carbon sheet composite catalysts have a potential window
increased by 10 times for generating syngas with the proper H2/CO ratio (1.7–2.15) for the Fischer–Tropsch
process and an increased syngas production rate of about 19 times
compared to that of a Ag foil. Additionally, we tuned the H2/CO ratio from ∼2 to ∼10 by adjusting only the quantity
of the Ag NWs under the given electrode potential. We believe that
our Ag NW/carbon sheet composite provides new possibilities for designing
electrode structures with a large potential window and controlled
CO2 reduction products in aqueous solutions.

1 Introduction
Global
climate change accelerated by carbon dioxide emissions has
increased the demand to reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration
by CO2 capture, storage, and conversion.1 Among these, CO2 conversion technologies, such
as bioconversion, electrochemical conversion, and combined reforming,
have attracted much interest for converting CO2 into value-added
products.2−4 Electrochemical CO2 conversion can produce
various fuels and carbon feedstocks, including CO, CH4,
HCOOH, and C2H4, at room temperature using renewable
energy resources.5,6 In particular, CO production by
the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is attractive because it involves only two electrons and is a
main component of syngas, which is widely used to synthesize value-added
hydrocarbons in various industries.6 Syngas,
a mixture of H2 and CO, can be transformed into various
hydrocarbons, such as methanol or synthetic crude oil, through the
Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process. In the F–T process,
the ratio of syngas is crucial to maximize the product yield. For
instance, the optimal H2/CO ratio for syngas to generate
hydrocarbons is 1.7 when using an iron-based catalyst and 2.15 when
using a cobalt-based catalyst.7,8

Metal catalysts
such as Au, Ag, and Zn can be used as electrochemical
catalysts to reduce CO2 to CO in aqueous solutions.5,9 With these metal catalysts, syngas can be directly produced by electrochemical
reduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous solutions because electrochemical
CO2RR in an aqueous solution always accompanies the H2 evolution reaction (HER) as a competitive reaction. However,
this competitive reaction is the main reason for potential-dependent
product distribution for typical CO2RR metal catalysts.
For example, in the case of Ag, the CO Faraday efficiency rapidly
decreases from about 90 to <20% when the applied potential is changed
from −1.02 to −0.75 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE)), respectively, in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3.10 This is due to the fact that the CO2RR current density for CO generation, jCO, is limited by the low solubility of CO2 in water
(34 mmol/L at 1 atm and 25 °C)11 and
the sluggish reaction kinetics, which requires a high overpotential
of more than 1 V to drive a sufficiently high jCO.12 This leads to considerable
generation of the HER current density, , at a low overpotential.
This potential-dependent
H2/CO distribution from a metal catalyst can limit the
use of electrochemical CO2RR for direct syngas production
and requires additional facilities to adjust the syngas ratio. Especially
in a two-electrode CO2 electrolysis system, it is difficult
to impose an exact electrode potential on a metal catalyst, and it
would cause a temporal variation in the H2/CO ratio. This
becomes further aggravated if unstable electricity resources like
photovoltaics and wind power are used. Therefore, to achieve cost-effective
and sustainable syngas production with the optimum H2/CO
ratio, it is crucial to develop a CO2RR catalyst capable
of tuning the CO2RR and HER rates over wide ranges of operating
conditions.

Thus far, the search for a single metal or bimetallic
catalyst
to convert CO2 to CO has focused on achieving the maximum
CO generation rate at a low overpotential by controlling nanostructures
and crystal facets.13−21 For example, nanoporous Au and Ag dramatically improve the CO2RR activity, showing nearly 100% CO production in an aqueous
solution at a low overpotential.14,16 Also, Ag with
an In(OH)3 support shows a higher CO current efficiency
than that of pure Ag and In(OH)3.20 In addition, Won et al. show that hexagonal Zn nanostructures with
(101) crystal facets are effective in converting CO2 to
CO.21 However, dominant CO production would
require additional H2 sources for direct syngas production.
Recently, Spurgeon et al. reported on the simultaneous production
of CO and H2 with tunable H2/CO ratios from
∼97 to 0.36 on a Cu foil by controlling the pulse times at
a specific bias during pulsed-biased CO2 electrolysis.22 However, simultaneous H2 and CO formation
with tunable compositions relevant to syngas with a large potential
window for optimum hydrocarbon production remains challenging in potentiostatic
CO2 electrolysis.

Here, we introduce porous composite
materials for producing syngas
with tunable H2/CO ratios for extended ranges of electrode
potentials in potentiostatic CO2 electrolysis. Our composite
material is composed of Ag nanowires (NWs) as the CO2RR
catalyst on top of a thick macroporous carbon sheet as the HER catalyst.
Compared to a Ag foil, our Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites have an
increased syngas production rate of about 19 times with a H2/CO ratio of 1.7–2.15, which is optimum for the F–T
process, and an increased range in the electrode potential of about
10 times during potentiostatic CO2 electrolysis in an aqueous
solution. In addition, controllability of the syngas composition from
∼0.7 to 80 was demonstrated by simply controlling the loading
amount of Ag NWs.

2 Results and Discussion
A schematic diagram of our composite CO2RR catalyst
for tunable H2/CO production is shown in Figure 1. Unlike conventional single-component
CO2RR catalysts for which the competitive HER and CO2RR occur on the same electrode surface (Figure 1a), our composite catalyst is designed to
reduce CO2 and water independently from the corresponding
CO2RR and HER catalysts following their own electrochemical
characteristics. For instance, as shown in Figure 1b, CO2 will be reduced to CO on
the CO2RR catalyst, which is on top of the macroporous
HER catalyst. Then, unreacted protons will be transported to the underlying
HER catalyst for H2 production. The macroporosity of our
composite catalysts provides facile transport of protons to the HER
catalyst as well as enhanced reactivity from the increased surface
area. To achieve a tunable H2/CO ratio over a wide range
of electrode potentials, both the CO2RR and HER catalysts
in the composite should have similar electrochemical current density–potential
(j–V) characteristics, such as the onset potentials
for CO2RR and HER, respectively. In addition, the products
ratio of CO can be independently controlled by changing the loading
amount of the CO2RR catalyst. In this work, we used Ag
NWs as the CO2RR catalyst and a macroporous carbon sheet
as the substrate for the Ag NWs and the HER catalyst. These Ag NWs
simply enable us to tune the H2/CO ratio by controlling
the quantity of sprayed Ag NWs. Also, we chose a carbon sheet although
it is known to be a poor HER catalyst because the HER onset potential
of the carbon sheet is well-matched with the CO2RR onset
potential of Ag explained below.

Figure 1 CO2RR schemes from (a) single-component
and (b) composite
catalysts for tunable H2/CO production during electrochemical
CO2RR electrolysis.

The Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites were fabricated by spraying
Ag NWs on a macroporous carbon sheet shown in Figure 2a. The synthesized Ag NWs with a 50 nm diameter
and ∼30 μm length were dispersed in solution and sprayed
by a sprayer previously described. After spraying, an intimate contact
between each Ag NW was made by annealing at 100 °C for 60 min.
The loading amount of the Ag NWs on a carbon sheet was controlled
by adjusting the spraying time. To quantify the Ag NW loading amount,
we measured the sheet resistance of the Ag NWs on a slide glass, which
were sprayed for the same amount of time as the spraying time for
the carbon sheet (see Figure S1).

Figure 2 (a) Schematic
diagram showing the fabrication of the Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composite by spraying the Ag NWs; scanning electron microscope
(SEM) images of the Ag NW composites with (b) 1.4 Ω/□,
(c) 0.5 Ω/□, and (d) 0.2 Ω/□ of Ag NWs.
The insets show enlarged images of the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites.

Figure 2b–d
shows the SEM images of the sprayed Ag NWs on the carbon sheets with
different spraying times. The sheet resistances of Ag NWs on the carbon
sheet are 1.4, 0.5, and 0.2 Ω/□, respectively. Hereafter,
these are referred to as the 1.4 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet
composite, 0.5 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite, and
0.2 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite. As clearly shown
in Figure 2b–d,
the sprayed Ag NWs are stacked mostly at the top of the macroporous
carbon sheets and form a porous structure, which creates a greater
surface area for CO2RR and could facilitate proton transfer
to the bottom of the macroporous carbon sheets for HER. In addition,
the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite with a lower sheet resistance has
more densely stacked Ag NWs compared to those in the Ag NW composite
with a higher sheet resistance. In other words, the exposed carbon
sheet surface area of the topmost region toward electrolyte would
be decreased as lowering the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite sheet resistance.
This means that the reaction areas for HER and CO2RR are
controlled by the quantity of Ag NWs, spontaneously. Therefore, the
evolution ratio of H2 and CO through the Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composites is adjustable by controlling the amount of Ag NWs.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composites shows peaks at 368.2 and 374.2 eV, indicating no
significant surface chemical state changes during the spraying or
annealing process (Figure S2). To figure
out the CO2RR property of Ag NWs themselves, we sprayed
different amounts of Ag NWs on Ag foils by adjusting the spraying
time. If the activity of Ag NWs for CO2RR is different
from that of a Ag foil, CO selectivity and electrochemical properties,
such as Tafel slope, partial current density (jCO), and total current density (jtotal), of Ag NWs sprayed on Ag foil electrodes would be changed with
increasing the quantity of sprayed Ag NWs. However, all of the “Ag
NWs on the Ag foil” electrodes and the bare Ag foil had a similar
CO selectivity and Tafel slope (∼180 mV/decade) as a function
of the applied potential (Figures S3–S5) despite different Ag NWs quantities. The similar CO2RR characteristics of Ag NWs and Ag foils are believed, mainly, due
to the exposed crystal facets of Ag NWs. According to our previous
work, our sprayed Ag NWs are single crystalline with the growth direction
of {110}: the (100) and (111) facets are mostly exposed in our sprayed
Ag NWs.23,26 Polycrystalline Ag also mainly expose the
(100) and (111) facets rather than (110) because of its low surface
energy.27−29 Because the Ag(100) and Ag(111) facets are known
to have similar CO2RR properties,30 no significant CO2RR property difference between our
Ag NWs and an Ag foil was observed from the CO2RR performance
of the Ag NWs sprayed onto the Ag foil.

To briefly look into
the electrode characteristics, linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) was conducted in a CO2-saturated 0.2
M KHCO3 aqueous solution (Figure 3). As clearly shown in Figure 3, bare Ag foil and bare carbon sheet show
a similar voltage onset of about −0.79 V, although the bare
carbon sheet has a higher current density than that of the bare Ag.
Interestingly, Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites also have a similar
voltage onset of about −0.79 V but exhibit different current
densities depending on the Ag NW loadings. Because of the higher exposed
surface area of the carbon sheet, for example, the 1.4 Ω/□
Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite has a more carbon sheet like j–V behavior than that of the 0.5
or 0.2 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite shown in Figure 3. Note that the LSV
curve of the Ag foil shows a similar behavior as that in previously
reported results.10

Figure 3 LSV of the carbon sheet,
Ag foil, and Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites
with 1.4, 0.5, and, 0.2 Ω/□ of Ag NWs in CO2-saturated 0.2 M KHCO3.

Gas chromatography (GC) showed a dramatic difference in the  and jCO compositions
depending on the applied potentials. Figure 4a–e shows the partial current densities
for HER and CO2RR of the five electrodes extracted from
the chronoamperometry. All data points were converted from the current
density–time curves in Figure S6, and 0.1–0.5 C charge was passed through the electrode surfaces.
The total Faraday efficiencies of all electrodes are shown in Figure S7. As seen in Figure 4a, the Ag foil has a typical potential-dependent
CO2RR activity, as reported elsewhere. For instance, the jCO of the Ag foil starts to increase at about
−0.79 V and becomes saturated at ∼10 mA/cm2 when the applied potential is more negative than −1.39 V.
The  of the Ag foil is suppressed up
to −1.39
V and then rapidly increases. Therefore, the H2/CO production
ratio is highly dependent on the applied potentials. In contrast,
a carbon sheet produces mostly  with a potential onset of about
−0.79
V. Note that the bare Ag foil and carbon sheet show a similar onset
potential of about −0.79 V for CO2RR and HER, respectively.
When the Ag NWs are deposited onto a carbon sheet, the jCO starts to increase, which is affected by the loading
amount of Ag NWs. For instance, the jCO of the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites at −1.79 V increases
to ∼6 from ∼2 mA/cm2 with increasing Ag NW
loading, as shown in Figure 4c–e. Note that the  of the Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composites originates
mostly from the carbon sheets underneath the sprayed Ag NWs when the
applied potential is more positive than −1.39 V. Therefore,  of the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites
decreases
with increasing amount of sprayed Ag NWs as the exposed carbon sheet
surfaces, that is, the sites for HER, are blocked by the sprayed Ag
NWs. Hence, in contrast to that of the Ag foil, the partial current
density difference between jCO and  of the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites
is
dramatically decreased with the 0.2 Ω/□ Ag NWs around
−1.2 V. Moreover, the partial current density difference can
be adjusted in accordance with the amount of Ag NWs: the 1.4 Ω/□
Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite has small changes in the partial current
density gap compared to those in the 0.2 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composite (Figure 4c,e). This leads to a tunable H2/CO ratio as a function
of the Ag NW loading for a large range of applied potentials.

sheet composite, (d) 0.5 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite,
and (e) 0.2 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite.

Figure 5 shows the
electrochemically generated H2/CO syngas ratios of the
Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites with various applied potentials. The
yellow box indicates the optimum syngas ratio (1.7–2.15) for
transforming syngas to hydrocarbons by the F–T process. As
clearly seen in Figure 5, the H2/CO ratio is controlled by the amount of Ag NW
loading for all potentials: at −1.2 V, the H2/CO
ratio is tuned depending on the quantity of loaded Ag NWs. More importantly,
the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite can generate syngas at the optimum
H2/CO ratio for the F–T process with a higher current
density and under larger potential ranges than those of the Ag foil.
For instance, the 0.5 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite
has around a 300 mV potential window for the optimal syngas ratio
range, whereas the Ag foil has only around a 30 mV potential window.
Moreover, the 0.5 Ω/□ Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite generates
syngas at a ratio of 2.15 with a higher production rate of about 19
times compared to that of the Ag foil: the total current densities
to produce H2/CO at a ratio of 2.15 from the 0.5 Ω/□
Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite and the Ag foil are ∼8.72 and
∼0.45 mA/cm2, respectively. In Table S1, we summarize the electrocatalytic syngas production
performances of Ag-based composite materials reported in the literature.
As clearly seen in Table S1, our Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composite is one of the best syngas-producing composite catalysts
with the highest syngas-producing current density with wide potential
ranges.

Figure 5 H2/CO ratio from the carbon sheet, Ag foil, and Ag NWs/carbon
sheet composites with different Ag NW loadings as a function of the
applied potential in a CO2-saturated 0.2 M KHCO3 solution.

Our study shows a new
composite catalyst structure for generating
syngas with tunable H2/CO ratios for a wide range of electrode
potentials in an aqueous electrolyte. However, our Ag NWs/carbon sheet
composite still suffers from high overpotentials and a small jtotal for large-scale application. To lower
the overpotentials in our composite catalyst, the Ag NWs need to be
replaced with other catalyst materials with low CO2RR overpotentials,
such as oxide-derived Au or Au nanoneedles.16,31 In this case, of course, substrates with a smaller HER onset potential,
such as C3N4@N-graphene or PCN@N-graphene, are
needed for tunable H2/CO production.32,33 In addition, the jtotal can be enhanced
by lowering the electrolyte temperatures or increasing the reactor
pressure to increase the CO2 solubility in an aqueous solution,
which is the main reason for the low CO2RR current density.
Alternatively, the CO2 solubility can be enhanced by adding
additives, such as ionic liquids, in an aqueous solution or using
a nonaqueous electrolyte.34

3 Conclusions
We present a strategy to develop an electrocatalyst
to produce
syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios by independently
providing reaction sites for HER and CO2RR during electrochemical
CO2RR in an aqueous solution. Ag NWs/macroporous carbon
composites were selected by considering each electrochemical performance
of the carbon and Ag for HER and CO2RR and prepared by
spraying the Ag NWs onto a carbon sheet. In our composite, the H2/CO ratio is controlled simply by changing the Ag NW loading
on the carbon sheet. Our Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite has potential
ranges that are 10 times larger for the generation of syngas with
the optimum ratio for the F–T process (from 1.7 to 2.15) and
a syngas production rate that is about 19 times higher than that of
Ag foil. Finally, we believe that, by identifying composite materials
with low overpotentials for HER and CO2RR as well as further
engineering of electrolytes for enhanced CO2 solubility,
our composite electrocatalyst design could be used to produce syngas
with a tunable H2/CO ratio by electrochemical CO2RR using renewable energy resources in large-scale applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Electrode Preparation
Ag NWs were
synthesized by the modified polyol process described previously.23 The solution of synthesized Ag NWs was sprayed
onto the carbon sheet (TGP-H; Toray Industries, Inc.) with a spray
system to fabricate a Ag NW network structure. The amount of Ag NWs
on the carbon sheet was monitored by measuring the sheet resistance
of the Ag NWs on a glass substrate, which was prepared at the same
time. The relationship between the sheet resistance and the quantity
of Ag NWs (mg/cm2) is shown in Figure S1. After the spraying, the carbon sheet was placed on a 100
°C hot plate to evaporate the solvent.24 The Ag NWs/carbon sheet composites with different sheet resistances
were fabricated by varying the spraying time of the Ag NW solution.
The Ag foil (99.998%; Alfa Aesar) was mechanically polished with sandpaper
(CC-400Cw; Daesung) and dipped into a 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution overnight to remove any organic impurities on the
metal surface before the CO2RR.25 All prepared electrodes with an attached copper wire on the back
side were sealed by industrial epoxy (Loctite 9460) to confine the
reactive area. The geometric surface area of the exposed electrode
was then determined by an image processing program (ImageJ) with scanned
images (300 dpi resolution).

4.2 Electrochemical Experiments
and Product Analysis
All electrochemical experiments were
performed with a gas-tight
single-compartment electrolysis cell. The total volume of the single-compartment
cell was 60 mL with 20 mL of 0.2 M KHCO3 (99.95%; Sigma-Aldrich)
and a 40 mL head space. A Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) electrode and a graphite
rod were used as a reference electrode and a counter electrode, respectively.
The reference electrode potentials were converted to RHE with equation E as follows: (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.209
V + 0.0591 V × pH. Prior to the CO2RR electrochemical
experiment, a 100 mL/min stream of CO2 gas (99.999%) was
purged for at least 30 min to saturate the electrolyte with CO2 and the pH of the solution was 6.8. The electrolyte solution
was stirred by a magnetic bar during the experiments. The electrochemical
properties of the electrodes were measured with a potentiostat (SP-150;
Bio-Logic Science Instruments). LSV curves for each electrode were
scanned from −0.3 to −1.8 V with a scan rate of 50 mV/s.
The quantification of the gas product was analyzed by GC (micro GC
3000; INFICON) equipped with a thermal conductor detector. Argon (99.9999%)
and helium (99.9999%) were used as carrier gases for a PLOT Q and
molecular sieve column, respectively. All gas products were generated
by constant potential electrolysis at seven different potentials.
The gas-phase products were directly injected from the single-compartment
cell into the GC column to minimize the contamination of the collected
gas product.

4.3 Microscopy Measurement
The surface
morphologies of the Ag NWs/carbon sheet composite and carbon sheet
were observed by a SEM (JEOL-7600F) operated at 5 kV. The surface
state of the five different electrodes was observed by XPS (Thermo
Scientific K-alpha).
