The surface properties
of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(polystyrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) affect the performance of many organic electronic
devices. The work function determines the efficiency of the charge
carrier transfer between PEDOT:PSS electrodes and the active layer
of the device. The surface free energy affects phase separation in
multicomponent blends that are typically used to fabricate active
layers of organic light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices.
Here, we present a method to prepare PEDOT:PSS films with a gradient
work function and surface free energy. This modification was achieved
by evaporation of trimethoxy(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane in such
a way that the degree of surface coverage of the molecules varied
in the selected direction. Gradient films were used as electrodes
to fabricate two-terminal PEDOT:PSS/poly(3-hexyl thiophene)/Au devices
to rapidly screen for the influence of the modification on the performance
of the prepared polymer diodes. Gradual changes in the morphology
of the solution-cast model poly(3-butyl thiophene)/poly-bromostyrene
films followed changes in the surface energy of the substrate.

==== Body
Introduction
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(polystyrene
sulfonate), better
known as PEDOT:PSS, is one of the most widely used conductive polymers
in organic electronics. Its unique electro-optical properties, such
as its high electrical conductivity and superior optical transparency
in the visible light range, make it applicable in energy storage devices,1 organic field transistors, organic light-emitting
diodes (OLED),2 and organic photovoltaic
devices (OPV).2 In many applications, PEDOT:PSS
layers act as transparent electrodes, in most cases with a supporting
solution-cast active layer of OLED and OPV. The overall performance
of optoelectronic devices depends on many factors, but the most important
are the morphology of the active layer and the energy level matching
for charge carrier injection/collection. The morphology of solution-processed
active layers of donors and acceptors depends on interactions at the
internal and external interfaces. Studies of model conjugated-insulating
polymer blends have shown that the latter can be tuned by adjusting
the surface free energy of the substrate.3 The formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAM) is one of the most
effective methods to achieve this goal. SAMs have been used to adjust
the energy levels of inorganic electrode-interfacing organic semiconductors.4

Several reported attempts to improve the
performance of organic
optoelectronic devices have focused on homogenous modification of
the PEDOT:PSS layer or its surface to improve the electrical contact
with the active layers. The easiest method to modify PEDOT:PSS properties
is to mix its dispersion in water with an additional component prior
to casting it on a substrate.5−8 It has been reported that glycerol mixed with PEDOT:PSS
increases the conductivity and improves the efficiency of polymer
light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices.6,7 This
is explained by a change in the work function (WF) due to surface
segregation of PSS.7 Systematic studies
by Pathak and co-workers have shown that doping PEDOT:PSS with organic
solvents increases its conductivity and modifies the injection barrier
at the interface with p-type silicon.9

To modify the free surface of a PEDOT:PSS layer, evaporation, solution
casting, and dipping methods can be used. A thin layer of M-phthalocyanine
evaporated on top of PEDOT:PSS increases the absorption at longer
wavelengths and the open circuit voltage of poly[bis(3-dodecyl-2-thienyl)-2,2′-dithiophene-5,5′-diyl]:phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (PQT-12:PCBM)-based photovoltaic devices.10 An ultrathin layer of fluorinated polyimide
lowers the hole injection barrier at the interface between PEDOT:PSS
and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-co-2,5-di(phenyl-4′-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)
when used as an active layer in polymer light-emitting diodes.11 A thin layer of a DNA complex on PEDOT:PSS enhances
the brightness of green and blue OLEDs.12 Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) increases the crystallization of
poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT):PCBM during thermal annealing, and
this effect is responsible for the increased short-circuit current
and higher power conversion efficiency of solar cells with a 4 nm
layer of PVDF at the interface between the anode and active layer.13 Recently, Lee and co-workers showed that a trichloro(octadecyl)silane
interlayer improves the performance of blue light-emitting diodes
by promoting hole injection from the anode into the active layer.14 Zhang et al. successfully changed the charge
selectivity of the electrode and fabricated inverted solar cells with
polyethylenimine (PEIE)-modified PEDOT:PSS as cathode.15 Another method to modify properties of PEDOT:PSS
was recently proposed by Moulé and co-workers.16 They demonstrated that PSS segregated to the free surface
mix with conjugated polymers upon thermal treatment, forming an insoluble
interlayer which affects the performance of the photovoltaic cell
formed on top.16

The vast majority
of work on the surface modification of PEDOT:PSS
has focused on the problem of anode and active-layer energy-level
matching. Relatively little attention has been paid to the influence
of surface energy modifications on the microstructure formation process
during the fabrication of the active layer. Zhang et al. have shown
that thin layer of PEIE increases the interfacial contact between
PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM and affects the morphology of OPV active layer.15 The authors proposed also a method to tune the
surface free energy of modified PEDOT:PSS by varying the pH value
of PEIE solution.15 Wang and co-workers
proved that the surface energy patterns formed at the PEDOT:PSS by
microcontact printing can enforce the ordering of structures in thin
films of conjugated polymers.17 This idea
was used by Chen to control phase separation in a P3HT:PCBM blend.18 The authors showed that patterns of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
self-assembled monolayers can induce self-ordering of the phase domains
in active layers of polymer solar cells. They observed an increased
efficiency in devices with P3HT stripes surrounded by a PCBM-rich
phase.

Optimization of the fabrication conditions when many
parameters
influence the overall performance requires preparation and testing
of multiple devices. The use of samples with a gradient of physicochemical
properties, called chemical libraries, can speed up this process.
This approach has also been applied successfully to optimize the fabrication
of organic optoelectronic devices,19−21 mostly to optimize the
composition of devices based on low-molecular-weight compounds deposited
by thermal evaporation.19−21

Here, we present a method
to fabricate PEDOT:PSS films with a gradient
of work function and surface free energy, i.e., the two factors that
directly (wok function) and indirectly (by influencing the phase separation
of active layer components) determine the performance of organic electronic
devices. The polymer surface was modified by evaporation of volatile
silane molecules in an adapted dip-coating setup. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) showed
a gradient in the silane surface coverage. The work function measured
by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) reached a maximum
value for approximately 15% of the fluorine surface concentration,
as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Contact angle
measurements showed monotonous growth of the surface free energy within
the achieved surface coverage. The performance of the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/Au
devices prepared on a modified substrate changed with the position
on the electrode following the spatial variation in the work function.
The morphology of the model poly(3-butyl thiophene)/poly-bromostyrene
blend solution cast on the modified substrate reflected the local
surface free energy of the substrate.

Results and Discussion
Homogenous
Modification
Homogenous modification of
the PEDOT:PSS surface was obtained by evaporation of silane molecules
from a toluene solution, which is a method that was successfully used
previously to functionalize the surface of organic semiconductors.22 The polymer films prepared on silicon wafers
or indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass were attached horizontally
to the lid of the weighing cell. The cell was filled with a 10 mM
solution of trimethoxy(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane (3FS) and immediately
closed; the distance between the sample and the free surface of the
solution was ca. 1 cm. All deposition experiments were carried out
in air at room temperature beneath a fume hood.

The number of
3FS molecules deposited on the surface as a function of the evaporation
time was tracked using the static mode of secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the first method,
the sample surface was bombarded with Bi3+ ions
(energy 30 keV) and the emerging ionized fragments were analyzed in
a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. Typically, in SIMS spectra
of SAM adsorbed on solid surfaces, signals corresponding to characteristic
fragments of the molecule are visible along with the others corresponding
to whole molecules, clusters of molecules and atoms of the substrate.23 For silane adsorbed on a soft PEDOT:PSS substrate,
the SIMS spectra also contain fragments of the polymer that often
interfere with the signals coming from the SAM. In the present study,
two fragments derived from 3FS molecules were tracked, F3C3H4SiO3– and
CF–, as presented in Figure 1A. An initial rapid increase in both signals
is followed by their saturation after 50 min of vapor treatment. In
contrast, the XPS spectra show continuous increases in the fluorine
atomic concentration at the surface for up to 160 min (Figure 1B) and this increase is accompanied
by the decay of the sulfur signal (S 2p) characteristic of PEDOT:PSS24 and increase in silicon (Si 2p, line at 102
eV) and F3C*–CH2 (line at 292.5 eV) signals25 (see Figure S1).

signals. (B) Fluorine surface atomic concentration calculated
from XPS spectra (see Figure S1) as a function
of evaporation time. (C) Fluorine and sulfur XPS profiles; eight sputtering
cycles correspond to 20 nm crater depth.

To ensure that the silane molecules only adsorbed on the
surface,
modified PEDOT:PSS films were sputtered using an argon cluster ion
beam, and the XPS spectra of the layers sputtered for different times
were recorded. In contrast to monoatomic ion beams, the gas cluster
ion beam does not destroy chemical bonds in organic materials, allowing
the collection of depth profiles of the chemical composition of the
studied samples.26−28 In Figure 1C, the atomic concentrations of fluorine and sulfur were plotted
as a function of the sputter time; the eight cycles of sputtering
led to the formation of a crater approximately 20 nm deep. The rapid
decrease in fluorine signal already observed in the first sputtering
cycle indicates that the 3FS molecules adsorbed selectively on the
surface and did not penetrate the PEDOT:PSS film.

The surface
energy and electronic properties of the 3FS-modified
PEDOT:PSS layer were studied using contact-angle measurements and
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), respectively. Figure 2A presents the change
in the shape of the diiodomethane and glycerol droplets placed on
the prepared and modified PEDOT:PSS layers deposited on a flat silicon
wafer. The evolution of the contact angle of both liquids on the PEDOT:PSS
surface as a function of the evaporation time is presented in Figure 2B. Glycerol and diiodomethane
were chosen as the polar and nonpolar liquids (water dissolves the
bare PEDOT:PSS surface and could not be used in this experiment).
The contact angle of diiodomethane increased from approximately 48
to 84° after 50 min of 3FS evaporation and remained constant
for longer times, whereas the value of the contact angle for glycerin
continued to increase from <40 up to 95° for the samples exposed
to silane vapor for 180 min. The measured values of the contact angles
were used to calculate the surface free energy of the 3FS-modified
PEDOT:PSS surfaces according to the Owens and Wendt model29 presented in Figure 2C. The surface free energy of the modified
layers monotonically decreased with the time of exposure to 3FS vapor,
i.e., from 65 mJ/m2 for the prepared samples to 42.5 mJ/m2 for the layers saturated for 180 min.

on prepared (top row) and modified PEDOT:PSS (bottom row) layer deposited
on flat silicon wafer, (B) contact angle of diiodomethane (red circles)
and glycerol (blue squares) droplets placed on modified PEDOT:PSS
film as a function of evaporation time, and (C) surface free energy
calculated according to Owens, Wendt model.

The variation of surface interactions induced by modified
PEDOT:PSS
are scarcely reported. Petrosino and Rubino observed slight changes
in total surface energy (71.65–73.43 mJ/m2) for
films with different PEDOT:PSS ratios.30 Zhang and co-workers controlled hydrophilicity of PEIE-modified
PEDOT:PSS in a wide range of contact angles (from 25° up to 50°)15 by changing pH of the PEIE solution. The variation
of surface energy obtained by our method, between 65 mJ/m2 (pristine) and 42.5 mJ/m2 (modified), can be compared
with previous reports on the surface tension-induced modification
of phase separation in blends of poly(3-alkylthiophene) (P3AT) with
insulating polystyrene (PS), leading to formation of lateral (2D)
and lamellar (L) morphology.3 Even much
lower differences in surface energy could induce such blend morphology
changes: between 35.4 mJ/m231 (SiOx, 2D) and 45 mJ/m232 (Au, L, P3AT on bottom) for PS/P3BT or between
35.4 mJ/m231 (SiOx, 2D) and 24 mJ/m233 (SAM-CH3, L, P3AT on top) for PS/poly(3-hexyl thiophene)
(RP3HT) or between 24 mJ/m233 (SAM-CH3, 2D) and 45 mJ/m232 (Au, L, P3AT on bottom) for PS/P3DDT, respectively.3

The ultraviolet photoelectron spectra presented in Figure 3A show that a buildup
of the
3FS layer changed the energy required by an electron to escape from
the PEDOT:PSS surface. The work function (WF) of the modified polymer
calculated as the difference between the secondary electron cutoff
and the energy of the incident photon is plotted as a function of
the evaporation time in Figure 3B. In the case of inorganic electrodes, the change in WF results
from the buildup of an electric dipole on the SAM-covered surface.34 In the presented experiment, the work function
first increased from 4.85 to 5.5 eV for a sample exposed to 3FS vapor
for 45 min and later decreased to less than 5.0 eV for 165 min of
vapor deposition. This observation can be explained as a buildup of
the second layer of 3FS molecules that begins after 45 min of vapor
modification.35 In this case, the dipole
moment of the second stratum should have the opposite direction. Reorganization
of the silane layer on the PEDOT:PSS surface is another possible explanation.36 The onset of this process corresponds to a fluorine
surface concentration of approximately 15%, as measured by XPS.

Heterogeneous Modification
Homogenous samples with
different surface properties were prepared using vapor deposition.
An alternative method to form self-assembled monolayers is incubation
in solution. Changing the incubation time with slow dipping in a SAM
solution leads to the formation of samples with a coverage gradient.
However, as shown here, evaporation from a diluted silane solution
is a very effective method to modify PEDOT:PSS with 3FS molecules,
limiting the usage of the slow dipping method to gradually modify
the surface properties of PEDOT:PSS. Test experiments have shown that
slow immersion of PEDOT:PSS films in a 3FS solution leads to the formation
of layers with slight changes in the surface composition or the formation
of inverted gradients, i.e., the fragments submerged longer in solution
were covered with fewer 3FS molecules than those submerged for shorter
times; see Figure S2. It shows importance
of formation in vapors rather than in liquid.

To heterogeneously
fabricate a modified PEDOT:PSS surface using vapor deposition, a part
of the film must be isolated from the silane vapor. This can be achieved
simply by partial immersion in a container with a liquid that does
not dissolve the polymer and does not alter its properties significantly.
A sketch of a specially designed dip-coater is shown in Figure 4A. The longitudinal sample
(1) was fixed vertically to the lid (2) and slowly lowered into a
thick-walled container (3) filled with toluene using a linear stage
(4). A recess was created on the edge of the container, and a small
amount of 3FS was placed in the recess to evaporate. A cylindrical
shield (5) was attached to the lid to limit the volume of the vapor.
Typically, the immersion time was up to 30 min, and at the end, the
sample was quickly raised, washed with toluene, and blow-dried with
nitrogen. Test experiments have shown that the method developed here
can be used to prepare heterogenous surfaces modified with various
volatile silanes.

Figure 4 (A) Schematic drawing of dip-coater used to fabricate
films with
gradient of silane coverage: (1) sample, (2) lid, (3) thick-wall container
filled with toluene, (4) linear stage, and (5) shield. (B) Variation
of fluorine atomic concentration (red circles, left axis) and work
function (blue squares, right axis) as a function of distance (bottom
axis) and vapor exposition time (top axis); original XPS and UPS spectra
are presented in Figure S2.

The XPS spectra presented in Figure S3 prove that the surface composition of the fabricated
samples changed
monotonically with the distance from the lower edge. Quantitatively,
the variation of the fluorine atomic concentration (left axis) as
a function of the distance (bottom axis) and vapor exposure time (top
axis) is presented in Figure 4B. The linear growth of the 3FS layer is similar to that of
the one described in Figure 1B, but in this case, the growth rate of the silane layer is
higher. After 30 min, the concentration of fluoride at the surface
reached almost 30%. The faster growth of the silane layer is likely
due to the higher concentration of 3FS vapor in the air volume above
toluene than that in the previous experiment. The same plot presents
the variation in the work function (right axis) on the modified surface, and the original
UPS spectra are presented in Figure S4.
Similar to the previous experiment, the work function also increased
up to 5.3 eV at the point located 20 mm from the upper edge and decreased
down to 4.4 eV for the longer evaporation time. The changes in the
work function obtained in the experiment significantly exceed those
reported previously for PEDOT:PSS films with different component ratios:
4.75–5.15 eV,30 admixed with different
compounds prior to solution coating (ΔWF −0.12 eV)8 and close to that observed for PEIE-modified
layers, i.e., 4.1–5.1 eV.15

Immersion in toluene may both modify the surface properties of
PEDOT:PSS and leach physisorbed molecules from the surface. The test
experiments showed that the UPS spectrum of unmodified PEDOT:PSS only
slightly changed after 30 min of immersion in toluene compared to
that in the untreated group, which indicated that the toluene bath
does not shift the work function. In turn, the XPS spectra of the
polymer layer modified by vapor deposition of 3FS molecules after
the same toluene treatment showed a decrease in the fluorine and silicon
concentrations, which was accompanied by an increase in the sulfur
content. This points to a partial washout of molecules loosely bound
to the surface. Therefore, when comparing the effect of the 3FS modification
obtained using the two methods discussed above, the time of the vapor
treatment is not a useful parameter. Instead, when the values of the
work function measured for the samples prepared via different methods
are plotted against the fluorine surface concentration, they fall
nicely on a single master curve, as presented in Figure 5. The additional measurements
of the contact potential difference (CPD) obtained using the Kelvin
probe for samples prepared by vapor deposition followed the same trend.

(WF) and contact potential difference (CPD) as a
function of fluorine surface concentration measured by XPS for homogenous
samples prepared by evaporation (blue symbols) and films gradually
covered with 3FS molecules.

Devices and Phase Separation—Chemical Library Approach
As a proof of concept, we verified the influence of the 3FS modification
on the electrical properties of the PEDOT:PSS electrode and the phase
separation that occurred in a polymer blend casted on top. The PEDOT:PSS
layers were prepared on top of longitudinal substrates and later modified
with 3FS according to the procedure described in the previous section
to fabricate a gradient of surface energy and work function. The 75
mm long Osilla scale-up glass slides with patterned ITO were used
as the substrates for the electrical measurements, and strips of silicon
wafers were used as the substrates in the phase separation studies.

Regio-regular poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (RP3HT) was spin-coated from
a chlorobenzene solution in an argon-filled glovebox. The edges of
each sample were wiped clean to provide electrical contacts with gold
electrodes thermally evaporated through a shadow mask in the final
step of the fabrication. A photo of a substrate with 12 pixels is
shown in Figure 6A.
At the beginning of the experiment, the lower edge of the substrate
touched the free surface of toluene. Taking into account the dipping
velocity, the time of exposure to 3FS vapor was estimated for each
pixel (center of the pixel) and is presented in the image. Because
of the shallow depth of the container, the last pixel was not immersed
in toluene. The I–V curves
were measured in an inert atmosphere for each of the devices and are
plotted in Figure 6B.

Figure 6 Performance of PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/Au devices prepared on substrate
with gradient of 3FS surface coverage: (A) photo of 12 devices (numbers
correspond to evaporation time in min), (B) current–voltage
characteristic measured for each of device, (C) forward current IFOR (right axis) and rectification ratio (RR)
(left axis) as a function of the device number. Morphology of P3BT/PBrS
films cast on bare (D–F) and modified (G–I) PEDOT:PSS:
(D, G) SIMS depth profiles, 2D composition maps of sulfur (E, H) and
bromine (F, I).

The first conclusion
from the analysis of the presented I–V curves is that the current flowing
through the PEDOT:PSS/3FS/RP3HT/Au device diminishes as the 3FS concentration
increases on the PEDOT:PSS surface. Quantitatively, the forward current
measured at the +1 V bias decreases logarithmically with the pixel
number, as presented in Figure 6C. This observation can be rationalized in terms of an increased
tunneling barrier for the charge carriers introduced by short alkyl
chains deposited on the PEDOT:PSS electrode. As the thickness of the
barrier increases linearly with evaporation time (Figure 2B) and the tunneling current
decreases exponentially with tunneling distance, exponential decay
in the current is expected.

In contrast, with the symmetric
current–voltage characteristics
typically observed for SAM layers,37 a
slight asymmetry can be seen in the curves presented in Figure 6B. This asymmetry reflects
the asymmetry in the work function of the electrodes confined in the
RP3HT layer. A detailed analysis of the currents at +1 and −1
V indicates a decrease in the rectification ratio (RR), which is defined
as a ratio of the currents measured in the forward and reverse bias,
RR = IFOR/IREV, from a value of approximately 1.7 for the first pixel to a value
of approximately 0.7 for the sixth pixel. There was a subsequent increase
for the pixels exposed to the 3FS vapor for longer times. This resembles
the trend in the work function variation with the increasing 3FS surface
concentration, as shown in the UPS and Kelvin probe experiments (Figure 5).

Mixtures
of polystyrene and poly(3-alkylthiophene) (P3AT) were
used previously in studies on phase separation as model systems to
search for self-assembling systems of insulating and conjugated polymers.3,38 Success in the pattern replication experiment would not be possible
without former studies on the influence of the surface interactions
on the phase structure formed in such blends cast on different substrates.3 Here, a chlorobenzene solution of poly(3-butylthiophene)
(P3BT) mixed with brominated polystyrene (PBrS) was used to study
the phase separation in polymer blends cast on top of the 3FS-modified
PEDOT:PSS surface. The insulating component was labeled with bromine
to enhance the contrast visible in the SIMS depth profiles and 2D
composition images.

In Figure 6C–I
the influence of the decreased surface energy in the modified PEDOT:PSS
layer on the morphology of the P3BT/PBrS films is shown. The 2D images
obtained for the films prepared on bare PEDOT:PSS surface show a 2D
structure with P3BT oval domains dispersed in a PBrS-rich matrix.
The corresponding depth profile revealed no wetting layers on the
free surface or at the interface with the PEDOT:PSS layer. The depth
profile and 2D images acquired for the P3BT/PBrS film cast on PEDOT:PSS
exposed to 3FS vapor for 30 min indicate a lamellar structure in which
the bottom poly(3-butyl thiophene) layer is covered with a punched
brominated polystyrene film. This observation is in agreement with
previous reports on P3BT/polystyrene phase behavior, showing that
this system forms a bilayer structure when cast on an Au substrate
(surface energy 45 mJ/m232),
whereas a 2D morphology is observed for samples cast on SiOx (surface energy 35.4 mJ/m231). In the case presented here, the upper PBrS
lamellae breaks as a result of a higher mismatch in the interface
energy between poly(3-butyl thiophene) and brominated polystyrene.

Conclusions
We have shown that the surface free energy of
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(polystyrene
sulfonate) films and their work function can be tailored by vapor
deposition of trimethoxy(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane. With the aid
of a modified dip-coater, a heterogeneous surface coverage of 3FS
was achieved. The work function of the modified PEDOT:PSS changed
with the number of silane molecules adsorbed on the surface; the value
first increased and then decreased with an increasing concentration
of fluoride on the surface. In contrast, a monotonic decrease in the
surface free energy was observed within the scope of the experiment.

Heterogeneous silane-modified PEDOT:PSS films with a gradient 3FS
surface composition were used as the bottom electrode in PEDOT:PSS/3FS/RP3HT/Au
devices and as substrate for solution-casted P3BT/PBrS films. Electrical
measurements showed that the change in the work function caused by
the adsorption of 3FS molecules influences the performance of all
12 devices prepared on the same electrode. The change in the surface
free energy induced a transition from the lateral to lamellar phase
separation in solution-cast P3BT/PBrS films. The use of substrates
with a gradient of physicochemical properties, called chemical libraries,
allows a reduction in the number of samples in systematic studies
on the effect of modification on the properties of the devices and
the layers prepared on top of them.

Materials and Methods
Sample
Preparation
Silicon wafers with a native silicon
dioxide layer (Si-Mat, GmbH, Germany) were cleaned by sonication in
toluene (POCh, Gliwice, Poland) for 10 min. Next, the wafers were
immersed in a H2O/H2O2/NH3(aq) solution and heated at 75 °C for 15 min, rinsed with deionized
water, and dried under a N2 flux. In the last step of the
cleaning, the wafers were immersed in a H2O/H2O2/HCl solution, heated at 75 °C for 15 min, rinsed
with deionized water, and dried under a N2 flux. ITO-covered
glass (Delta Technologies) substrates were cleaned by sonication in
2-propanol for 15 min and dried under N2 flux.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(polystyrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios THL Solar dispersion in water –
Heraeus GmbH, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe
filter and spun-cast onto prepared substrates at 3000 rpm. The prepared
thin films were annealed at 120 °C by 20 min.

Electronic
grade poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (RP3HT, Rieke Metals)
was dissolved in chlorobenzene to form a 15 mg/mL solution. Before
casting, the solution was heated at 60 °C overnight inside an
argon-filled glovebox. The prepared solution was spun-cast into prepared
PEDOT:PSS thin films covered with a gradient 3FS layer.

Poly(3-butyl
thiophene) (P3BT, Rieke Metals) and dPBrS (Polymer
Standards Service (PSS) GmbH) were dissolved in chlorobenzene to prepare
a 10 mg/mL solution. Both solutions were heated at 60 °C overnight,
blended in a 1:1 volume ratio, and spun-cast onto PEDOT:PSS thin films
covered with a 3FS gradient layer.

Characterization Techniques
SIMS
Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was used
to investigate the surface composition of the modified PEDOT:PSS layers
and the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the P3BT/PBrS films cast
on top.

A secondary ion mass spectrometer with a TOF analyzer
TOFSIMS 5 (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany) system working in single-beam or
dual-beam mode was used to investigate the surface composition of
the modified PEDOT:PSS layers and the 3D structure of the P3BT/PBrS
films cast on top. Static SIMS spectra (total dose up to 9 ×
1010 ions/cm2) were acquired using a pulsed
30 keV Bi3+ ion beam scanned over a 200 μm
× 200 μm area, and the secondary ions were extracted into
a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer before reaching the
MCP detector. For each sample, five different areas were examined
and used to calculate the intensity of the selected signals. To obtain
composition versus depth profiles, 2D map samples were sputtered with
a Cs low-energy ion beam (500 eV, 32 nA) rastered over a 300 μm
× 300 μm area, exposing the dip layers of the film. The
structures revealed in the crater center were analyzed with a focused
bismuth beam (imaging mode) rastered over a 100 μm × 100
μm area and a ToF mass spectrometer.

XPS
XPS analyses
were performed in a PHI VersaProbeII
Scanning XPS system using monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-rays
focused to a 100 μm spot and scanned over a sample area of 400
μm × 400 μm. The photoelectron take-off angle was
set to 45°, and the pass energy in the analyzer was set to 23.50
eV to obtain high energy resolution spectra for the C 1s, F 1s, Si
2p, and S 2p regions. A UPS analysis was performed using a helium
gas-discharge lamp, He 1α (21.22 eV) and He 2α (40.81
eV), under a base pressure of 3 × 10–9 mBar
and 4 mm diameter area of analysis. The analyzer pass energy was set
to 2.95 eV. Depth profiling was performed by sputtering with a 10
keV Ar 4000 cluster ion beam and 8 mm × 8 mm sample area. The
instrumental resolution was determined to be 0.15 eV at a 2.95 eV
pass energy using the Fermi edge of the valence band for metallic
gold (room temperature). The secondary electron cutoff was determined
from the spectrum, and the WF of the material was calculated.

Contact
Angle
Static contact angles were measured for
two reference liquids: polar glycerol and nonpolar diiodomethane.
The experiments were performed by the sessile drop technique using
a θ-light instrument at room temperature. Contact angles were
determined as the average of 10 measurements taken at different spots
on the same sample surface. The Owens–Wendt analytical approach
was applied to calculate the surface free energy.

Surface Potential
Difference
The contact potential
difference was measured using a Kelvin probe (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland)
with a 2 mm gold grid reference electrode.

Electrical Characterization
Current–voltage
characteristics were measured under an argon atmosphere in a glovebox
with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source-meter unit.
