Carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation is an important step
for efficient
utilization of carbon resources in C1 (one carbon) chemistry. Over
recent years, this direction has been a hot research area in academia
and industry and has also been one of the most challenging routes
for the nonoil carbon resources utilization process. A large number
of novel reaction routes and catalysts have been studied and reported.
Efficient activation and directional conversion of CO are key aspects
in the process of CO utilization. Furthermore, effectively activating
C–O and C–C bond formation as well as controlling carbon
chain growth is the current technical bottleneck of CO hydrogenation.
This mini-review introduces the latest research progress for different
catalyst systems and processes in CO hydrogenation and analyzes the
factors that control the performance of catalysts in different reaction
systems. Here, much focus is put on the synthesis of long-chain hydrocarbons,
light olefins, C2+ oxygenates, and aromatics, essentially
in comparison with the previous reports. Finally, the present challenges
and future research directions have been discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
C1 chemistry refers to
the chemistry of molecules containing a
single carbon atom, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane,
and methanol, which plays an important role in energy conversion and
the value-added chemical preparation platform.1 Conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas: CO + H2) has been extensively studied. Syngas can be prepared easily from
abundant and cheap natural carbon resources by reforming natural gas,
gasification of biomass, coal, or combustible garbage. By activating
C–O bonds and regulating the formation of C–C bonds,
syngas can be converted into a variety of petroleum-based chemicals
with added value which include light olefin (C2–C4), gasoline (C5–C11), jet fuel
(C8–C16), diesel (C10–C20), aromatic hydrocarbons, and oxygen-containing compounds.
These compounds critically determine the direction of the chemical
and energy industries. In 1936, a synthetic fuel preparation plant
was established in Germany to use coal-derived syngas as a raw material.
In the decades that followed, factories were built in countries as
diverse as South Africa and Malaysia, with some of them producing
more than one million tons per year. In an era when needing energy
supply was rife, research on syngas conversion was developed rapidly,
as an alternative energy source for oil.2 Due to the continuous exploitation of petroleum resources, reserves
of light and low-impurity crude oil rapidly decrease, leaving more
aromatic-rich heavy oils with higher impurity concentrations. Syngas,
as a substitute of petroleum energy, is of great significance in producing
chemicals and liquid fuels, and its introduction allays anxiety and
uncertainty over the energy factor of the future. Recently, several
teams have made breakthroughs in the field of syngas conversion.

It is well-known that the main pathways of syngas conversion are
Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis reaction (direct), methanol
synthesis, and methanol to hydrocarbon (MTH) synthesis reaction (indirect),
being operated in industry. Catalysts play a crucial role in FT synthesis.
FT synthesis is a classic syngas to hydrocarbon pathway first proposed
and named after Hans Fischer and Franz Tropsch in 1925. FT synthesis
converts syngas into a series of hydrocarbons through a heterogeneous
catalytic process. A widely accepted reaction process is that CO and
H2 are adsorbed and activated on the surface of the catalyst
to form CHx (x < 3) particles. Through the coupling of CHx species, the coupling of C–C
bonds forms the intermediate product CnHm (n ≥ 2), to
realize the growth of the carbon chain. Methane is also formed as
a byproduct when CHx is
hydrogenated. The intermediate CnHm is further hydrogenated to an alkane or dehydrogenated
to an alkene. Due to the sufficient supply of H2, the n-alkane of the long chain is the main product of this process,
and the carbon number distribution of the product follows the distribution
law of Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF). According to the
distribution rule of ASF, the highest selectivity of products is limited
to C2–C4 58%, C5–C11 48%, C8–C16 41%, and C10–C20 40%.2 How
to break through the limitation of selectivity of ASF products by
designing a reasonable catalyst is a research direction of great interest
to many researchers.

The conventional FT reaction is dominated
by Co-, Fe-, and Ru-based
catalysts.1,3 Fe-based catalysts are a relatively mature
FT catalyst. It has good reaction performance, low price, and low
selectivity of methane, while secondary hydrogenation is not easy
to occur. This weak carbon chain growth ability and suitable hydrogenation
ability of Fe-based catalysts improve the olefin content in the reaction
products as previously reported.3,4 However, there are still
some challenges, such as high CO2 byproduct selectivity.
Therefore, appropriate additives or optimization of catalyst structure
are needed to improve the reaction performance. Compared with Fe-based
catalysts, Co-based catalysts have a characteristic high activity,
higher C–C chain growth ability, and low water gas shift reaction
(WGSR: CO + H2O = CO2 + H2) activity.
The product is mainly saturated alkane.5 Ru-based catalysts have better catalytic activity than Fe-based
and Co-based catalysts, in addition to better anticarbon deposition
ability. However, due to its high price and high cost (Ru based),
it is not suitable for industrial application. In recent years, scientists
have conducted a lot of research on the reaction mechanism and structure
of FT catalysts and made a series of substantial progress. Nevertheless,
the deactivation caused by carbon deposition of a traditional catalyst
and the difficulty in product distribution regulation still pose great
challenges to FT synthesis.

Because of the restriction of the
ASF distribution, it is difficult
to improve the selectivity of a specific FT intermediate hydrocarbon
fraction. Coupling metal oxides and modified zeolites can realize
the tandem reactions, which is an effective method to break the limitation
of ASF law. Generally, there are two types of catalysts that have
been recently designed to break the limitation of the ASF product
distribution. The first type is coupling FT metal catalyst and zeolite.
After activation, syngas realizes carbon chain growth on the FT catalyst,
and then product distribution is modified by regulating the acidic
and or porous properties of zeolite, where the products are directly
synthesized.6 The second type is the combination
of the methanol synthesis catalyst and a zeolite. The intermediate
products (such as methanol and dimethyl ether) are first synthesized
on the methanol synthesis catalyst and then converted to hydrocarbons.7,8 By optimizing the design of either multifunctional catalysts, the
product distribution can be precisely controlled.

2 Syngas Conversion to Long-Chain Hydrocarbons
(C5+)
As more experiments were carried out to
break the ASF limitation
of FT hydrocarbon distribution, researchers found that secondary cracking
occurred in the reaction process. Many catalysts with multiple functions
can also accurately optimize product distribution.1,9 Researchers
have achieved the integrated control of the liquid fuel in the product,
obtainable at high yields. Many groups have studied syngas conversion
catalysts over recent years, prepared by physical mixing, incipient
wetness impregnation, core–shell structure fabrication, or
the physical sputtering method.9,10 Our research group
has designed different types of catalysts to combine a metal, carrier
(such as Co/Al2O3, Co/SiO2, fused
Fe, etc.), and molecular sieve (H-ZSM5, H-Beta, etc.) to prepare multifunctional
catalysts. By adding promoters, regulating the activity of metal,
optimizing the acidic amount and strength, or adjusting thickness
and pore structure, high liquid hydrocarbon yield could be attained.1,9 Based on our previous research, we successfully realized the highly
selective synthesis of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel using nanoscale
cobalt particles confined inside the mesoporous Y-type molecular sieve
cage as the catalyst for FT synthesis.5 It is well-known that the addition of suitable alkali metal can
improve the activity of catalysts and the selectivity of C5+ in the products.11,12 We used an ion exchange method
to modify the mesoporous Y-type zeolite with Ce4+, La3+, and K+. The acidity and pore sizes of the zeolite
were adjusted to obtain Co/Ymeso–Ce, Co/Ymeso–La, and Co/Ymeso–K catalysts. As a comparison,
Co/Ymicro–Ce, Co/Ymicro–La, and
Co/Ymicro–K catalysts with microporous support were
also prepared using the same methods. The reduction degree, metal
particle distribution, and particle size of the catalysts were calculated.
After performance test, the catalytic reaction results of Co/Ymeso–Ce, Co/Ymeso–La, and Co/Ymeso–K catalysts showed excellent selectivity for gasoline,
jet fuel, and diesel, up to 74%, 72%, and 58%, respectively (Figure 1).

selectivity was based on the weight fraction of a product with respect

Catalysis.

Different from the previous regulation of most
products, the pore
structure and acidity of Y-type zeolite were regulated by ion exchange
and implantation of mesopores. Consequently, the high selectivity
of various liquid fuels on demand (gasoline, aviation fuel, or diesel)
was achieved.

In addition, the characterization results showed
that because of
the existence of Ce and La particles Co/Ymeso–Ce
and Co/Ymeso–La catalysts were detected with more
moderate Brønsted acidity. No Brønsted acidity was detected
in Co/Ymeso–K. The Co/Ymeso–H
catalyst showed lower reduction degree and stronger Brønsted
acidity after NH+ ion exchange. Such strong acidity may
lead to excessive cracking of hydrocarbons and generate more undesirable
light hydrocarbons. It can also be clearly observed in Figure 1a that its selectivity of C2–C4 products was significantly higher than
that of other catalysts. This study reveals that the pore structure
and acidity of the Y-type zeolite play a key role in the optimization
and regulation of product distribution. In addition, since the traditional
ASF product distribution law can no longer accurately describe the
product distribution in many multifunctional catalyst systems, here
we establish a new extended model of the ASF distribution model to
describe the product distribution in the FT-based multifunctional
catalyst. While using the α model of the chain growth index,
we propose the concept of cleavage contribution degree β. The
product distribution of FT-based multifunctional catalysts is predicted
by using the dual key parameter (α, β) model. The establishment
of this model is of great help to the design and development of new
FT catalysts in the future.

3 Syngas Conversion to Light Olefins (C2–C4)
Olefins, especially light olefins
(ethylene, propylene, butene),
are the most basic raw materials in the chemical industry and are
among the largest amount of chemicals in the world. The main source
at present is petroleum, which is obtained by cracking (FCC). The
synthesis of light olefins from syngas provides a new catalytic route
which is cleaner and more efficient.

The conventional route
of FT synthesis is to modify Co- or Fe-based
catalysts with some auxiliary components such as alkali metals and
transitional metals (Mn, Ru, etc.), to improve olefin selectivity.
According to the distribution law of ASF, the proportion of C2–C4 hydrocarbons in the products cannot
exceed 58%, and the selectivity of methane is higher than 29%. This
is far from the expected efficient use of syngas, so researchers are
constantly trying to break through the product limit in ASF theory
by designing catalysts. De Jong’s team applied Fe nanoparticles,
evenly loaded onto an α-Al2O3 or carbon
fiber, and modified them with promoter to obtain light olefin selectivity
of up to 60%, which was beyond the product limit of ASF law, but the
selectivity of methane in the products was still higher than 22%.4 Sun reported that Co2C prism nanoparticles,
developed coincidentally or endogenously from the as-prepared nanoscale
CoMn during reaction, were found responsible for syngas to light olefin
synthesis. The catalyst changed into two phases (Co2C and
MnO). Unlike conventional spherical Co2C, which was not
conducive to FT synthesis, the Co2C here was prismatic,
exposing (101), (−101), and (020) crystal planes. These in
situ crystal planes resulted in high light olefin selectivity of 60.8%,
and low methane selectivity was maintained at 5.0%. The reaction conditions
were mild (1 bar, 250 °C), and the syngas with lower H2/CO ratio (H2/CO = 0.5–2.0) was used as the raw
material.13 After activation of the catalyst
for more than 15 h under the reaction conditions, the light olefin
selectivity increased from less than 20% to more than 50%, and the
selectivity of C5+ products decreased from about 80% to
less than 40%. Stable operation for 30 h was maintained, while methane
selectivity was always around 5%. On the product distribution, the
CoMn catalyst was quite different from the traditional FT catalyst.

Bao’s team reported a new multifunctional catalyst named
OX–ZEO (oxide–zeolite), which achieved one-step syngas
conversion to light olefin with high selectivity and conversion.6 The catalyst consists of metal oxide ZnCrOx and SAPO zeolite and has a life of over 100 h under 400
°C, 2.5 MPa, and H2/CO = 1.5, which makes it suitable
for industrial application. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are activated
on the surface of the metal oxides to form the CH2 species
and then convert them to ketene (CH2CO). The ketene diffuses
into the SAPO zeolite, and at the acidic active site it is converted
to light olefins. The C2–C4 hydrocarbon
product selectivity is as high as 94%, among which the C2–C4 olefin is 80%; the C2–C4 alkane is 14%; and CO conversion is 17%. Meanwhile, the selectivity
of methane is controlled at 2%. It is found by characterization that
during FT synthesis there is polymerization among CHx generated on the catalyst surface, and
the distribution of C chain length can be described by the ASF model.
When the composite metal oxide is partially reduced and used to activate
CO, the polymerization of the CHx intermediate on the catalyst surface can be effectively
inhibited, and CO can be inserted to form a ketene. This study separates
the two processes of CO activation and C–C bond formation to
achieve a breakthrough in the selectivity limitation of FT synthesis.
The team then reports another multifunctional catalyst, ZnCrOx–MOR, which can achieve a highly selective synthesis
gas to ethylene conversion.14 Ethylene
selectivity in hydrocarbon products is up to 80%. It is found that
the Brønsted acid located in the 8-membered ring of MOR zeolite
is the active center of ethylene production. The intermediate ketene
is more likely to be adsorbed in the 8-membered ring, while methanol
is more likely to be adsorbed in the 12-membered ring (Figure 2).

Ma reported that the Fe–Zn–Na catalyst
obtained by
modifying Fe2C5 with Zn and Na achieved CO conversion
of 63.0% at 340 °C and 2 MPa.15 The
selectivity of C2–C4 hydrocarbons and
C5+ hydrocarbons was 22.6% and 46.3%, respectively. The
ratio of olefin to paraffin was as high as 7.4, and the CO2 selectivity was maintained at 22.5%. When the CO conversion reached
to 82.7%, C2–C4 and C5+ hydrocarbon
selectivity was maintained at 22.6% and 46.3%, respectively, and the
selectivity of CO2 was only 11.7%. It was found that Na
had a crucial effect on the performance of the catalyst in the FT
reaction. Na could transfer electrons to Fe on the surface of the
catalyst and change the electronic structure of Fe5C2. The change directly affected the adsorption and hydrogenation
behavior of the intermediate on the catalyst surface. Olefins desorbed
quickly on the catalyst surface containing Na, while on the surface
of catalysts without Na, olefins were more likely to be hydrogenated
to paraffins.

Wang reported the Zn-ZrO2/SSZ-13 bifunctional
catalyst
for the synthesis of light olefin.8 They
studied the influence of Zn/Zr ratio, acidity of SSZ-13, contact distance
between Zn-ZrO2 and SSZ-13, temperature, pressure, and
contact time on the catalyst performance. The Zn-ZrO2 activated
CO and formed the intermediate product, CH3OH or CH3O, followed by coupling of the C–C bond to generate
light olefin, with high efficiency. When the CO conversion was 10%,
the light olefin selectivity was 87%. When the CO conversion was increased
to 29%, the light olefin selectivity could still be maintained at
77%, and the selectivity of methane was always lower than 3%. Methanol
and dimethyl ether existed as intermediates to promote syngas conversion.
The activation energy of syngas on the surface of ZrO2 was
close to that of the Zn-ZrO2/SSZ-13 catalyst. The results
of the analytical kinetic equation show that the rate determination
step is the adsorption of CO and H species on different active centers
of the oxide surface, and the reaction rate can be described by the
Langmuir–Hinshelwood equation. The characterization results
confirmed that there were abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface
of ZrO2; CO combined with these hydroxyl groups to form
stable formate species and further reacted to form methoxyl groups
with H species. The reaction of CO and hydrogen on the surface of
Zn-ZrO2 is key to the production of light olefin. In this
process, formate and H species formed methoxide slowly, which determined
the rate of the whole reaction. The reaction path on the oxide surface
was CO adsorption → formate → methoxy → methanol/dimethyl
ether → light olefin (Figure 3).

4 Syngas Conversion to C2+ Oxygenates
C2+ oxygenates are a kind of chemical raw material with
high value, such as alcohols, aldehydes, ethers, and esters, containing
two or more carbon atoms in a molecule. The C2+ alcohol,
also known as high alcohol, is expected to be used directly as a fuel
or as a clean gasoline additive. Industrial high alcohol is also an
important basic raw material, or chemical intermediate, which can
be synthesized to surfactant, detergent, plasticizer, and a variety
of other fine chemicals. In recent years, important progress has been
made in the preparation of C2+ oxygenates through catalyst
design and selectivity regulation. In the synthesis of high alcohols,
modified methanol catalyst, modified FT catalyst, Rh-based catalyst,
and Mo-based catalyst have been widely studied.16 It is generally accepted by researchers that during the
synthesis of high alcohols both the chain growth center and the oxygen-containing
species insertion center are needed on the catalyst surface, and the
contact boundary of the active center is more conducive to form the
oxygen-containing products. However, the reaction mechanism of high
alcohol synthesis is complex, and there are many competitive reactions
and side reactions, resulting in many byproducts. In addition, the
hydrogenation of CHx intermediate
species has a lower thermodynamic barrier than CO insertion, resulting
in a generally low selectivity of C2+ oxygenates.

Sun reported a CoMn|CuZnAlZr catalyst for syngas conversion to
C2+ oxygenates.17 When the CO
conversion was 29%, the selectivity of oxygenates reached 58.1 wt
%, where the C2+ oxygenate content exceeded 92.0 wt % and
the total selectivity of oxygenates and olefin in the product reached
80.6 wt %. The researchers found that in the CoMn|CuZnAlZr catalyst
product distribution was affected by spatial structure and that, when
reasonably regulated, the spatial structure of the metallic site could
significantly control product distribution. Therefore, the undesirable
C1 products (MeOH, CH4, CO2) could be inhibited.
It is believed that there exist dual active centers on Co/Co2C in the synthesis of high alcohols. The CuZnAlZr catalyst can change
the microenvironment around the active center and provide a large
number of CHxO* species,
which is conducive for CO diffusion to the surface of CoMn and the
insertion reaction and then promote the generation of oxygenates (Figure 4).

catalyst. Reproduced with permission from ref (17). Copyright 2019. Angewandte

Our group reported a capsule zeolite catalyst with
core–shell
structure (Figure 5A).18 Silicalite-1 or H-ZSM-5 zeolite
as shell is allowed to grow naturally on the Cu/Zn/Al2O3 core through hydrothermal synthesis to obtain CZA-Z and CZA-S
core–shell structure catalysts. The aluminum migration method
was used such that the core catalyst played a role as the aluminum
resource in the hydrothermal process. This catalyst design could effectively
regulate the reaction sequence, break the thermodynamics equilibrium
limitation of the methanol synthesis process (whose comprehensive
reaction mechanism was investigated by Xu et al., in 200919), and promote the conversion of syngas. Meanwhile,
the zeolite shell provided a good dehydration environment for methanol,
which greatly improved the selectivity of dimethyl ether. Compared
with the traditional physical mixed catalyst, the selectivity of dimethyl
ether increased from 40.51% to 96.59%, and the methanol selectivity
decreased from 57.29% to 3.41%. Using CZA-S catalyst, the selectivity
of dimethyl ether remained at 78.57% when the CO conversion was maintained
at 30.40%. According to the continuous reaction concept, synthesis
gas → dimethyl ether → methyl acetate → ethanol,
we first invented a multifunctional catalyst to realize ethanol synthesis
from syngas and dimethyl ether by coupling Cu/ZnO and H-MOR zeolite.20,21 However, Cu-based catalysts suffer from some limitations because
of the tendency of copper to sinter at high temperatures (Cu more
effective ≤250 °C). It was also found that metallic agents
(Ru, Pd, Pt) could promote carbonylation. When the reaction conditions
were 493 K and 1.5 MPa, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether on a separate
H-MOR zeolite catalyst obtained a selectivity of up to 92.2% methyl
acetate with a yield of 1076.1 mmol kg–1 h–1. The conversion of dimethyl ether was 83.1%, and the selectivity
of CO2 was lower than 5.4%. When Cu/ZnO was added as the
second stage catalyst, the ethanol selectivity could be maintained
at about 41.0%.

Chemie International Edition.

In the process of carbonylation of dimethyl ether,
H-MOR zeolite
would be affected by the presence of water which inhibits carbonylation
reaction. Wang further designed the Cu–Zn–Al/H-ZSM-5|H-MOR
catalyst.22 The addition of H-ZSM-5 separated
Cu–Zn–Al from H-MOR zeolite and promoted the further
occurrence of water–gas shift (WGS) reaction in water. The
carbonylation rate was guaranteed after water consumption, and the
activity of the catalyst was significantly improved. The selectivity
of methyl acetate obtained under 473 K and 3 MPa was up to 95%. Further
study found that the combination of ZnAl2O4 with
spinel structure and H-MOR zeolite (ZnAl2O4|H-MOR)
could realize the highly selective conversion of syngas to methyl
acetate and acetic acid at high temperature (340–370 °C).
When CO conversion was 11%, the total selectivity of methyl acetate
and acetic acid was up to 87%. Using a three-layer structure catalyst
ZnAl2O4|H-MOR|ZnAl2O4 could
directly convert syngas into ethanol, and the selectivity was 52%.
The multiple layer catalyst ZnAl2O4|H-MOR|ZnAl2O4|H-MOR was capable of producing ethylene from
synthetic gas because ethanol can continue to dehydrate on the added
H-MOR zeolite. The selectivity of ethylene was about 50%. Mixing the
terminal ZnAl2O4 with H-MOR zeolite could further
improve the ethanol dehydration efficiency, and the ethylene selectivity
could improve to 65% (Figure 5b).

5 Syngas Conversion to Aromatics
Aromatics
are important raw materials for the chemical industry
and can be used to prepare many fine chemicals. The aromatic products
are a hydrocarbon mixture with benzene ring structure. In industry,
they are mainly used in the production of synthetic fibers, synthetic
rubber, and synthetic resin, to mention a few. Aromatics can also
be used as gasoline additives with high octane number. Traditionally,
aromatic hydrocarbons are produced from petroleum or prepared by catalytic
reforming. It is however very imperative and of high research value
to develop a new synthetic route for aromatics.

Ma and Fan reported
the route of synthesizing aromatics from syngas
with olefin as an intermediate.23 Based
on a study involving the Na–Zn–Fe5C2 catalyst, researchers mixed this catalyst with some mesoporous zeolite
of H-ZSM-5. Fe5C2 (in Na–Zn–Fe5C2) was the active phase for alkene synthesis.
In essence, Na acted as an electronic promoter by enhancing the fundamental
surface reactions to produce more alkenes, at the same time suppressing
hydrogenation of olefins by weakening their adsorption on the catalyst
surface. HZSM-5 attained a mild Bronsted acidity micromesoporous (hierarchical)
state after modification which greatly improved the mass transfer
of reactants and products on the catalyst. At 340 °C, 2 MPa,
about 50.6% aromatics were obtained in the hydrocarbon products. The
selectivity of CO2 was inhibited to 27.5%, while the selectivity
of methane was 9.6%. The total aromatics yield was over 32.3%. Ding
reported a bifunctional catalyst with hollow structure of H-ZSM-5
and Fe3O4@MnO2 to realize the direct
synthesis of aromatics from syngas. When the aromatics’ selectivity
was 56.6%, CO conversion could be as high as 90.3%. No significant
deactivation of catalyst was observed during the 180 h test.24 For the Fe3O4@MnO2 catalyst, the confinement effect of the core–shell
structure and the influence of Mn additives promoted the conversion
of syngas into olefin intermediate species, which was effectively
converted into aromatic target products on the acidic active site
within hollow H-ZSM-5. The suitable H-ZSM-5 channel and hollow structure
were conducive to the diffusion of reactant and product molecules
and promoted the generation of aromatics. The concentration of carbon
deposition in the pore channel of the zeolite was inhibited, and the
stability of the catalyst was significantly improved.

The new
catalysts from the recent studies have yielded surprising
results on the efficient synthesis of aromatics from syngas. However,
there are still few studies on the preparation of single aromatic
hydrocarbons with added value, from syngas. Among aromatic compounds, para-xylene (PX) is an important chemical with added value.
Wei used the Zn/P/Si/ZSM-5 catalyst and methanol as the starting material
to prepare PX with high selectivity.25 Through
modifying the surface, the internal acidity in the catalyst was strong,
and the surface acidity was weak. This acidic gradient assumed therein
could inhibit hydrogen transfer on the catalyst surface, thereby extensively
restricting hydrogenation and isomerization side reactions. The yield
of aromatics from MeOH was over 60%, and the selectivity of PX was
improved from the usual 23–24% to 89.6%. Our group designed
a new type of Cr/Zn–Zn/Z5@S1 hybrid catalyst to first realize
directional conversion of syngas to PX.26 This catalyst is comprised of two parts, i.e., Cr/Zn oxide catalyst
and Zn/Z5@S1 with core–shell structure, which could escalate
PX selectivity to 77.3% in the xylene isomers and 27.6% selectivity
in total hydrocarbon products at CO conversion of 55.0% (Figure 6). At the same time,
the selectivities of CH4 and C2–C5 hydrocarbons were lowered to 4.4% and 33.6%, respectively,
which makes it obvious that isomerization side reactions were greatly
interrupted. This catalyst could combine the tandem reaction of syngas
to methanol and methanol to PX. There existed an interaction between
the two active components in the catalyst. The syngas was first converted
to the methanol intermediate on the Cr-based catalyst, and the methanol
intermediate diffused to the active site within the zeolite to generate
PX. This special Zn/Z5@S1 core–shell structure effectively
protected the acidic sites of zeolite, avoiding their overexposure
at the outer surface of zeolite, inhibiting the formation of undesirable
xylene isomers and promoting the directed synthesis of PX. However,
the catalyst still suffers from the formation of numerous byproducts
(alkane/alkenes and other aromatic compounds). Thus, other investigations
around the thickness of the silicalite-1 zeolite shell coating on
the Zn/Z5 core zeolite could further weaken side reactions.

6 Conclusions and Outlook
In the past
decades, due to concerns of oil energy exhaustion and
increasing environmental requirements, the efficient and green conversion
of syngas has attracted extensive attention in academia and industry.
Here, the research progress of high efficiency catalysts in syngas
conversion is reviewed. These new catalysts and novel reaction routes
are of great importance. The mechanisms of reaction and catalyst structure
need to be further studied as there are still many new challenges.

First, some new multifunctional catalysts for long-chain hydrocarbon
selective synthesis from syngas, breaking the distribution limit of
the ASF law, were summarized. The multifunctional catalysts were prepared
by combining different metal auxiliaries and alumina or porous materials
such as zeolite. The intermediate products such as dimethyl ether/light
olefin and others could be regulated by adjusting the acidic active
sites of the zeolite in the catalyst, and the secondary reaction of
intermediate products was optimized to promote the concentration of
products. However, the product distribution still needs to be further
adjusted to obtain a more reasonable ratio of alkanes, isomeric alkanes,
cycloalkanes, and other products.

The synthetic route of syngas
to olefin and C2+ oxygenates
was also summarized. The catalysts reported in this part mainly combined
the FT catalyst or methanol synthesis catalyst with zeolite. After
addition of zeolite, the selectivity of the products could be significantly
improved. However, compared with the traditional FT synthesis, the
single-pass conversion rate was generally lower. The strong interactions
between metals have a significant effect on catalyst activity, as
well as interactions between metals and zeolite, which means the catalyst
design should be more prudent. Catalyst composition, spatial distance,
acid strength, pore structure, and reaction conditions are key factors
to be investigated. However, it is still challenging to improve the
single-pass conversion and the stability of catalysts while maintaining
a high selectivity. In addition, the reaction mechanism in relation
to catalytic performance becomes more complicated when involving the
combination of multiple reactions; therefore, further research and
exploration are also needed.

Finally, the synthesis of aromatics
from syngas was introduced.
Aromatics are mainly synthesized by a petroleum-based route at present.
Here, we reported the recent synthesis of aromatics (PX) via the FT
route or methanol route. Because aromatic hydrocarbons are one of
the most important chemicals, these novel synthetic pathways are quite
impressive. However, researchers are still faced with severe challenges.
In the process of reaction, synthetic gas has to go through methanol/light
olefin synthesis, hydrogen transfer, oligomerization, cyclization,
dehydrogenation, and other reactions, and the whole process is quite
complicated. The selectivity and stability of the product are sensitive
due to the Brønsted acid centers and pore structure in the zeolite
channel. Achieving high selectivity of the target product is still
changing. There are few studies on the synthesis of aromatics from
syngas at present, and therefore more research is needed to reveal
the mechanism of the whole process.

In conclusion, efficient
conversion of syngas is an important energy
and chemical conversion platform, which plays a vital role in energy
security and chemical industry development. A large number of articles
in the field of syngas conversion have been published, which indicate
that researchers attach great importance to this field. In the future,
further attention should be paid to the relationship between the reaction
mechanism, catalyst structure, and performance, especially the pore
structure of zeolite, acid regulation, and metal interaction of multifunctional
catalyst. Further design of multifunctional catalytic systems and
more precise control of product selectivity are expected.
