Bisphenol
F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) are replacing bisphenol
A (BPA) in the manufacturing of products containing polycarbonates
and epoxy resins. Data on current human exposure levels of these substitutes
are needed to aid in the assessment of their human health risks. This
study analyzed urinary bisphenol levels in adults (N = 1808) and children (N = 868) participating in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014
and investigated demographic and lifestyle factors associated with
urinary levels of bisphenols. BPA, BPS, and BPF were detected in 95.7,
89.4, and 66.5% of randomly selected urine samples analyzed as part
of NHANES 2013–2014, respectively. Median levels of BPA in
U.S. adult were higher (1.24 μg/L) than BPF and BPS levels (0.35
and 0.37 μg/L, respectively). For children, median BPA levels
were also higher (1.25 μg/L) than BPF and BPS levels (0.32 and
0.29 μg/L, respectively). The limits of detection for BPA, BPF,
and BPS were 0.2, 0.2, and 0.1 μg/L, respectively. Urinary levels
showed associations with gender, race/ethnicity, family income, physical
activity, smoking, and/or alcohol intake that depended on the specific
bisphenol. The results of this study indicate that exposure of the
general U.S. population to BPA substitutes is almost ubiquitous. Because
exposures differ across the U.S. population, further studies of environmental,
consumer, and lifestyle factors affecting BPF and BPS exposures are
warranted.

==== Body
Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) (4,4′-(propane-2,2-diyl)diphenol)
is a
high-volume industrial chemical, with a global consumption of approximately
7.7 million metric tons in 2015, and the global BPA demand is projected
to increase to 10.6 million metric tons by 2022.1 BPA is used for the manufacturing of polycarbonates and
epoxy resins as well as various low-volume specialty applications.2,3 Because of growing human health concerns, the use of BPA-based plastics
in food and beverage applications is under scrutiny. The use of BPA
in baby bottles is now prohibited in Canada, the European Union, and
the United States.4−6 The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) added BPA in
2017 to the Candidate List of substances of very high concern. Because
of the concern about its potential toxicity in humans, BPA is increasingly
replaced by structurally similar chemicals, in particular bisphenol
F (BPF) (4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl-methane) and bisphenol S (BPS)
(4,4′-sulfonylbisphenol), in the manufacturing of polycarbonates
and epoxy resins. BPF and BPS are also used in a variety of common
consumer products, for example, thermal paper.7 According to ECHA, 1000 to 10 000 million metric tons of
BPS are manufactured or imported annually into the European Economic
Area. No production data for BPF are currently registered with ECHA,
suggesting that BPF is still a low use chemical, at least in Europe.8

BPA, BPF, and BPS have been detected in
many environmental samples,
including soil, sediments, water, sewage effluents, and sewage sludge.9 They have a comparatively low octanol–water
coefficient (log Kow < 5), are readily
biotransformed in the environment, and do not bioaccumulate and biomagnify
in aquatic and terrestrial food chains.3,9,10 BPA typically is the most prevalent bisphenol analogue
in the environment; however, BPF and BPS are also frequently detected
in environmental samples from around the world. Bisphenol analogues
are present in a broad range of consumer products and in foodstuffs,
with BPA and BPF being major contaminants present in foods from the
United States.11 BPF is also a natural
product present in mustard.12 Environmental
exposure of humans to BPA and its substitutes (e.g., BPF) occurs via
the diet.9,13,14 Dermal exposure
to personal care and other consumer products, ingestion of household
dust, and inhalation represent additional routes of exposure to bisphenols.15−18 Dermal contact with products containing bisphenols, such as handling
thermal receipt paper, represents a source of occupational exposure
to BPA and its substitutes.19

BPA,
BPF, and BPS are rapidly metabolized to the corresponding
glucuronides by mammalian uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases
(UGTs).20,21 As has been shown for BPA, these glucuronides
are rapidly eliminated with urine in rats and humans.22−24 Total urinary levels, typically determined after deconjugation with
β-glucuronidase/sulfatase, are considered to be a robust biomarker
for exposure to bisphenols.25 BPA is ubiquitous
in humans and, for example, was detected in earlier studies in >92%
urine samples from the U.S. population.26−28 The limits of detection
(LODs) for BPA, BPS, and BPF were ≤0.4 μg/L in these
studies.26−28 BPA and its metabolites have also been detected in
human serum, placental tissue, cord blood, and breast milk.29 A human biomonitoring study reported lower detection
frequencies for BPS (42 to 91%) in urine from several Asian countries
compared to those of BPA.30 Japan and the
U.S. were exceptions, with detection frequencies of BPS in urine of
100 and 97%, respectively.

Several other studies also suggest
that urinary levels of BPS and
BPF are currently lower compared to that of BPA.28,30−32 For example, median concentrations of BPS in urine
samples from the Asian countries including China, India, Japan, Korea,
Kuwait, Malaysia, and Vietnam were 1 order of magnitude lower than
the median concentrations reported for BPA in the same set of samples,
with the exception of samples from Japan.30 Geometric means of urinary levels of BPF and BPS were at least 3
and 30 times lower than those reported for BPA in adults (age 26–84
years, N = 94) from South China.31 Detection frequencies of 79.2% for BPA, 67.8% for BPS,
and 40.2% for BPF were observed in urine samples from pregnant women
from the Netherlands (N = 1396) collected in 2004–2005
(LODs < 0.18 μg/L).32 Median levels
of BPS and BPF were lower compared to that of BPA in this study population.
Studies quantifying BPF and BPS in other human compartments are limited,
and both bisphenol analogues have relatively small detection frequencies
in human serum and breast milk.19,33,34 Taken together, the presence of BPA substitutes in humans raises
questions about their adverse human health effects.

Evidence
from epidemiological and animal studies implicates BPA
in sex-specific adverse outcomes, including effects on the brain,
immune system, reproductive system, and metabolic processes.3,35,36 Significantly less information
about potential adverse health outcomes is available about BPF and
BPS. Exposure to BPF and BPS was not associated with obesity in the
general U.S. population; however, higher exposure to BPS may be associated
with greater body mass index and waist circumference.37 Urinary levels of both BPA and BPS were strongly correlated
with oxidative stress, as determined using 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine
urine levels, in a population from Saudi Arabia exposed highly to
BPS.38 BPA, but not BPF, was positively
associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone in a case-control study
from Cyprus and Romania investigating an association between bisphenol
exposure and thyroid nodular disease.39 Evidence from in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies provides a
mechanistic basis for a link between BPF and BPS exposure and adverse
health outcomes, such as obesity, in humans: Similar to BPA, BPF and
BPS are endocrine-disrupting chemicals and display hormonal activity,
with similar average estrogenic, androgenic, and antiestrogenic potencies
across different in vitro assays.40−42 Both BPF and BPS differentially
affect signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis43,44 and cause DNA damage.42

Previous
population-based studies with human biomonitoring data
have mainly focused on BPA. For BPA substitutes, including BPF and
BPS, available data were based on convenience samples, rather than
representative samples,28,30 or focus on a specific,
at-risk population, such as pregnant women.32 It is therefore imperative to know the current exposure status of
BPF and BPS in a sample that is representative of the entire U.S.
population, including children and adolescents, and to characterize
the difference in the levels of these environmental phenols depending
on population characteristics and lifestyle factors. The present study,
for the first time, reports urinary levels of total BPA, BPF, and
BPS in the U.S. population by using the nationally representative
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
2013–2014. Demographic and lifestyle factors associated with
urinary levels of all three bisphenols were analyzed as well. The
results of this analysis demonstrate both similarities and differences
in contemporary exposure of the U.S. population to BPA and its substitutes
that warrant further attention.

Results and Discussion
Detection
Frequency and Levels of Urinary BPA, BPF, and BPS
BPA was
found in nearly all urine samples analyzed as part of NHANES
2013–2014, with a detection frequency of 95.7%. This number
is comparable to detection frequencies reported in earlier studies
of the general U.S. population.26−28 The LODs for BPA in these earlier
studies were comparable to the LOD in this study and ranged from 0.1
to 0.4 μg/L. Detection frequencies of BPA ranged from 74 to
99% in archived urine samples from U.S. adults (N = 616) collected between 2000 and 2014.28 The lowest detection frequency in this earlier study (74%) was observed
in samples collected in 2014. In our study, detection frequencies
of BPS and BPF were 89.4 and 66.5% in urine from U.S. adults, respectively.
The lower detection frequencies of both substitutes compared to BPA
are consistent with earlier, small-scale biomonitoring studies in
the U.S. and other countries.28,30 The LODs for BPF and
BPS in the earlier studies were ≤0.1 μg/L.28,30 In urine samples collected in 2004–2005 from pregnant women
from the Netherlands (N = 1396), detection frequencies
of BPA (79.2%) were also higher compared to the detection frequencies
of BPS (67.8%) and BPF (40.2%).32 Only
limited information regarding time trends in the levels of BPS and
BPF in humans is currently available. Detection frequencies for BPF
ranged from 42 to 88% in urine samples from U.S. adults collected
between 2000 and 2014 and showed no clear trend with time.28 In the same study, BPS had the lowest detection
frequencies (19–74%) of all three bisphenols. Unlike those
of BPF, detection frequencies of BPS in the urine from U.S. adults
increased from 2000 to 2014.28 Because
BPA, BPF, and BPS are glucuronidated by human UGTs20,21,53 and, as has been shown for BPA, rapidly
excreted with the urine,23 their high detection
frequencies in spot urine samples from the NHANES population indicate
that the general U.S. population is continuously exposed to all three
bisphenols.

Median urinary levels of BPA in the adult U.S. population
(N = 1808) were 1.24 μg/L (interquartile range,
0.57–2.49 μg/L) (Table 1). Median urinary levels of BPF and BPS were 0.35 μg/L
(0.14–1.11 μg/L) and 0.37 μg/L (0.14–0.88
μg/L), respectively. For comparison, creatinine-adjusted median
urinary levels of BPA and its substitutes in adults were 1.20 μg/g
creatinine (0.73–2.09 μg/g creatinine) for BPA, 0.46
μg/g creatinine (0.21–1.06 μg/g creatinine) for
BPF, and 0.39 μg/g creatinine (0.21–0.84 μg/g creatinine)
for BPS (Table S2). The BPA levels observed
in our analysis of NHANES 2013–2014 data for the adult U.S.
population are of the same order of magnitude as the levels observed
in other studies. For example, a geometric mean BPA level of 2.6 μg/L
has been reported for the NHANES 2003–2004 cycle.26 An examination of convenience urine samples
of U.S. adults showed a significant decrease in urinary levels of
total BPA from 2.07 μg/L in 2010 to 0.36 μg/L in 2014,28 which is consistent with the global phaseout
of BPA in food packaging, thermal paper, and other consumer products
that contribute to human exposure.54,55 Urinary levels
of BPA in the NHANES 2013–2014 population are also within the
range of concentrations reported for several other countries. For
example, the 2007–2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey reported
geometric mean urinary BPA levels ranging from 0.82 to 1.49 μg/L
for the adult Canadian population.56 Geometric
mean levels of BPA in urine samples collected from 2010 to 2013 in
several European and Asian countries ranged from 0.84 μg/L in
Japan to 1.59 μg/L in India.31,57,58 In a study of pregnant women from the Netherlands,
median levels of BPA were 1.66 μg/L (0.72–3.56 μg/L)
in urine samples collected in 2004–2005 (N = 1396).32 Levels of 2.99 μg/L
(0.233–27.6 μg/L; N = 116) were reported
for a more highly exposed population living near an E-waste-dismantling
area in China.59

a All variables were adjusted using
population weights for the sample in which BPA concentration was measured
except N (unweighted sample size). ANOVA was used
to compare differences of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and
BPS among various categorical variables. The analysis of creatinine-adjusted
concentrations of BPA, BPS, and BPF is presented in Table S2, Supporting Information.

b Race/ethnicity was categorized based
on self-reported data into Hispanic (including Mexican and non-Mexican
Hispanic), non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other race/ethnicity.37

c Self-reported
education was grouped
as less than high school, high school, and college or higher.37

d Family
IPRs were categorized as
≤1.30, 1.31–3.50, and >3.50.37,50

e Self-reported smoking
was classified
as never smokers who smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime;
current smokers who currently smoke cigarettes; and ever smokers who
smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but do not smoke
currently.37

f Self-reported physical activity
was used to derive MET minutes per week according to the Global Physical
Activity Questionnaire Analysis Guide71 and categorized as <600, 600–1200, and >1200 MET min/week.37

g Alcohol
intake was categorized as
non-drinker (0 g/day), moderate drinker (0.1–28 g/day for men
and 0.1–14 g/day for women), or heavy drinker (≥28 g/day
for men and ≥28 g/day for women).51

Information about urinary
levels of BPF and BPS is much more limited
compared to that of BPA. A study in pregnant women from the Netherlands
reported median levels of 0.36 μg/L (0.17–1.08 μg/L; N = 1396) for BPS and 0.57 μg/L for BPF (0.30–1.29
μg/L; N = 1396).32 Median BPF levels of 0.365 μg/L (<LOD to 8.68 μg/L; N = 116) were observed in a Chinese population living near
an E-waste-dismantling area.59 These levels
are comparable to the levels observed in the adult NHANES 2013–2014
population in this study (Table 1). Median BPS levels in this study (0.37 μg/L)
were higher than BPS levels (median 0.191 μg/L, <LOD to 21.0
μg/L; N = 315) observed in urine samples collected
from 2010 to 2011 in several Asian countries, including China, India,
Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, and Vietnam.30 Some studies report higher urinary BPS levels compared to the NHANES
2013–2014 data. For example, median levels of BPS were 1.04
μg/L (N = 36) in urine from Japan30 and 4.92 μg/L (N = 130)
in urine from Saudi Arabia.38 Although
these two studies only investigated a small number of individuals,
these findings indicate that, compared to the US, some countries may
have significantly higher exposures to BPS because of unique, country-specific
environmental factors and consumer behaviors. In the adult U.S. population,
BPS showed a slight increase in detection frequency and geometric
mean concentration in urine from not calculated in 2010 to 0.25 μg/L
in 2014.28 This finding is not surprising
because of the replacement of BPA with BPS and other bisphenols in
various consumer products. Interestingly, no clear time trend was
observed for urinary levels of BPF,28 possibly
because of the low detection frequency on BPF in urine or because
BPF is a natural product present in foodstuff, in particular mustard.12

Age, Gender, and Race/Ethnic Differences
in Urinary BPA, BPF,
and BPS Concentrations in U.S. Adults
BPA levels differed
significantly between age groups (P < 0.001; Table 1); however, no significant
differences were observed in the linear regression analysis (Table 2). Urinary levels
of BPA showed a trend to increase with age in adult Koreans, with
60–69 year old Korean adults having the highest BPA levels,60 whereas a decrease in urinary BPA concentrations
with age has been reported for the NHANES 2005–2006 population.17 Several other biomonitoring studies reported
no association between levels of bisphenols in adults and age.32,60−62 Overall, associations between urinary levels of BPA
and, possibly, its substitutes and age appear to vary in different
adult populations, suggesting that more complex environmental factors
contribute to adult exposures. Moreover, exposure patterns may change
in a population, as suggested by the different age trends of BPA levels
observed in the NHANES 2005–200617 versus NHANES 2013–2014 data (this study).

a The analysis of creatinine-adjusted
concentrations of BPA, BPS, and BPF is presented in Table S3, Supporting Information.

b Race/ethnicity was categorized based
on self-reported data into Hispanic (including Mexican and non-Mexican
Hispanic), non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other race/ethnicity.37

c Self-reported
education was grouped
as less than high school, high school, and college or higher.37

d Family
IPRs were categorized as
≤1.30, 1.30–3.50, and >3.50.37,50

e Self-reported smoking
was classified
as never smokers who smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime;
current smokers who currently smoke cigarettes; and ever smokers who
smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but do not smoke
currently.37

f Self-reported physical activity
was used to derive MET minutes per week according to the Global Physical
Activity Questionnaire Analysis Guide71 and categorized as <600, 600–1200, and >1200 MET min/week.37

g Alcohol
intake was categorized as
non-drinker (0 g/day), moderate drinker (0.1–28 g/day for men
and 0.1–14 g/day for women), or heavy drinker (≥28 g/day
for men and ≥28 g/day for women).51

Urinary levels of BPA
(P = 0.002) and BPF (P = 0.03) were
significantly higher in urine samples from
male compared to female adults (Table 1). BPS levels were also higher in men than in women;
however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08). Gender-related differences in urinary levels
did not reach statistical significance in the linear regression analysis
for any bisphenol investigated (Table 2). Similarly, biomonitoring studies from across the
world consistently report that geometric mean urinary levels of BPA
in men are higher compared to women; however, these differences were
frequently not statistically significant.26,56,58,61−63 Only limited information about gender differences in urinary BPF
and BPS levels is available. A biomonitoring study in several Asian
countries versus the U.S. observed higher geometric mean levels of
BPS in men versus women (0.239 μg/L vs 0.126 μg/L, respectively);
however, this difference did not reach statistical significance in
the entire study population.30

It
is noteworthy that men have slightly higher estimated daily
intakes of BPA than women based on an analysis of the NHANES 2005–2006
data.17 It is currently unknown if there
are gender differences in the daily intake of BPF and BPS. In addition
to differences in exposures, gender differences in the toxicokinetics
of the bisphenols investigated could contribute to gender differences
in urinary levels of bisphenols. For example, gender differences in
the hepatic expression of UGTs, including the major BPA metabolizing
isoform UGB2B15, and other human drug-metabolizing enzymes are well
established.64 Indeed, gender differences
in BPA metabolism have been reported for BPA in a small number of
Korean adults, with higher urinary levels of the BPA glucuronide in
males, but higher levels of the BPA sulfate in females.65 However, these differences in specific BPA conjugates
did not translate into significant differences in urinary BPA levels
by gender in the Korean study population.

Statistically significant
race/ethnicity-dependent differences
were observed for BPA (P = 0.007) only in the analysis
of variance (ANOVA) (Tables 1 vs 2). An earlier analysis of data
from NHANES 2003–2004 revealed significant differences by race/ethnicity,
with lower least-squares geometric mean levels observed in Mexican
Americans than non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks.26 The earlier finding that levels of BPA are lower
in Mexican Americans in the NHANES 2003–2004 population is
consistent with results from a German biomonitoring study reporting
lower levels in children from families with a migration background.66 Significant race/ethnicity-dependent differences
in urinary levels were also observed for BPS (P =
0.001, Table 1). These
findings were confirmed in the linear regression analysis, where urinary
levels of BPS in Hispanics (β coefficient 0.23, P = 0.02) and non-Hispanic blacks (β coefficient 0.35, P = 0.005) were significantly different compared to non-Hispanic
white (Table 2). A
small biomonitoring study investigated an association between race/ethnicity
and urinary BPS levels in a small population of mostly Caucasians
and Asians from Albany, New York.30 This
study found higher levels of BPS in Caucasians versus Asians; however,
this difference did not reach statistical significance. A recent study
reported lower BPS levels in pregnant women of non-European descent
living in the Netherlands compared to Dutch women of European descent.32

Factors Affecting Urinary Levels of BPA and
Its Substitutes
in U.S. Adults
In the linear regression analysis (Table 2), the income-to-poverty
ratio (IPR) was associated with urinary BPA levels in the adult NHANES
2013–2014 population, with lower BPA levels being detected
in individuals from the high versus low IPR group (β coefficient
−0.14 and P = 0.01). Levels of BPF were also
significantly different between the medium versus low IPR group (β
coefficient 0.30 and P = 0.02). Interestingly, levels
of BPF appeared to be higher in the group with a medium family income
compared to that with a low family income. Similar to our findings,
an earlier analysis of NHANES 2003–2004 data revealed an association
between family income and urinary BPA levels.26 Income was also significantly associated with urinary BPA levels
in Korea, with the lowest levels observed in the highest income group,67 whereas no associations were observed in an
earlier study of Korean adults.60 A biomonitoring
study in Germany found no correlation between the socioeconomic status,
which includes household income, and BPA exposure levels.66 Similarly, urinary BPA levels were not significantly
associated with income in the 2007–2009 Canadian Health Measures
Survey; however, the least-squares geometric mean BPA level of the
third quartile income group was significantly higher compared to that
of the fourth quartile income group.56 These
limited studies suggest that, at the time of each study, household
income is linked to region- or country-specific factors that affect
exposure to specific bisphenols. For example, the findings from our
analysis of the NHANES 2013–2014 data raise the question if
differences in BPA versus BPF exposures by household income reflect
a shift from using BPA to BPA-free (but BPF-containing) consumer products
in more affluent U.S. households.

Linear regression analysis
revealed that urinary levels of BPA (β coefficient 0.19 and P = 0.01) were higher in current smokers compared with adults
who never smoked (Table 2). Higher urinary BPA levels have also been observed in Chinese smokers.62 Similarly, women who smoked during pregnancy
had higher environmental bisphenol levels in urine in a biomonitoring
study from the Netherlands.32 Smoking was
not associated with BPA levels in the NHANES 2003–2004 data26 and in Korean adults.60,67,68 A negative association between smoking and
BPA levels has been reported for the NHANES 2005–2006 population.17 Although smoking affects the expression of drug-processing
genes in the intestine and the liver, these changes are expected to
increase the expression of drug-processing genes involved in the metabolism
of BPA and its substitutes and, consequently, do not explain higher
BPA levels in smokers. It is more likely that smoking is a surrogate
for other factors associated with exposure to bisphenols.17

Statistically significant differences
based on alcohol intake were
observed for BPS in ANOVA (P = 0.03, Table 1). Moreover, in the linear regression
analysis, alcohol intake was associated with urinary BPS levels, with
alcohol intake being significantly different between the moderate
drinker and non-drinker groups (β coefficient −0.29 and P = 0.004, Table 2). In addition, physical activity was associated with urinary
BPA levels (β coefficient 0.14 and P = 0.02, Table 2) in the linear regression
analysis. It is currently unclear why these lifestyle factors are
associated with urinary levels of specific bisphenols. As for smoking,
these factors may be surrogates for physiological or lifestyle factors
affecting exposures to bisphenols and further studies are needed to
better characterize these factors.

Urinary Concentrations
of BPA and Its Substitutes in U.S. Children
and Adolescents
Median bisphenol concentrations in U.S. children
(6–11 years old) were 1.34 μg/L (0.70–2.72 μg/L; N = 409) for BPA, 0.27 μg/L (0.14–0.85 μg/L)
for BPF, and 0.27 μg/L (0.12–0.64 μg/L) for BPS
(Table 3). For comparison,
creatinine-adjusted median urinary levels of BPA and its substitutes
in children were 1.80 μg/g creatinine (1.05–3.08 μg/g
creatinine) for BPA, 0.45 μg/g creatinine (0.19–1.18
μg/g creatinine) for BPF, and 0.40 μg/g creatinine (0.21–0.78
μg/g creatinine) for BPS (Table S4). Adolescents (12–19 years) in the NHANES 2013–2014
population (N = 459) had urinary levels of 1.14 μg/L
(0.60–2.30 μg/L) for BPA, 0.37 μg/L (0.14–1.10
μg/L) for BPF, and 0.30 μg/L (0.13–0.77 μg/L)
for BPS (Table 3).
In this age group, creatinine-adjusted levels were 0.93 μg/g
creatinine (0.60–1.71 μg/g creatinine), 0.38 μg/g
creatinine (0.15–1.04 μg/g creatinine), and 0.29 (0.16–0.58
μg/g creatinine) for BPA, BPF, and BPS, respectively (Table S4).

a All variables were adjusted using
population weights for the sample in which BPA concentration was measured

to compare differences of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and
BPS among various categorical variables. The analysis of creatinine-adjusted
concentrations of BPA, BPS, and BPF is presented in Table S4, Supporting Information.

c Family

Children had higher median
BPA levels compared to adolescents (P = 0.051; Table 3), a difference that
reached statistical significance in the
linear regression analysis (β coefficient −0.40 and P < 0.0001; Table 4). The opposite trend was observed for urinary BPF levels
in children; however, this difference was not statistically significant
in the linear regression analysis. Urinary BPS levels were not significantly
different between both age groups. An earlier analysis of the NHANES
2003–2004 data revealed a decrease in urinary levels of BPA
from children to adolescents to adults.26 Human biomonitoring studies from different parts of the world consistently
report higher urinary levels of BPA in children than in adults.58,63,67,69 BPS levels were also higher in adolescents than in adults in a study
of human exposures to BPS in Asia and the U.S.30 These earlier findings are consistent with a higher xenobiotic
intake of children and adolescents compared to adults due to a higher
food intake and respiratory rate compared to adults; exposure to bisphenols
via ingestion of household dust; more (dermal) contact with products
containing BPA or its substitutes; and differences in the absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion of xenobiotics between children
and adults. It is important to note that urinary levels of BPA were
significantly higher in children compared to adults in the NHANES
2003–2004 population,26 whereas
median urinary levels of BPA in young adults (20–39 years old)
were higher compared to those in children (6–11 years old)
in the NHANES 2013–2014 population (1.47 vs 1.34 μg/L),
possibly because of the ban of BPA in certain consumer products in
the United States and other countries.

Hispanic), non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other race/ethnicity.37

c Family
IPRs were categorized as

In the linear regression
analysis, gender was associated with BPS
levels, but not with BPA and BPF levels, in children (β coefficient
0.16, P = 0.045; Table 4). BPS levels were higher in female children
compared to male children. Significant differences based on race/ethnicity
were observed for urinary BPF (P = 0.007) and BPS
(P = 0.02) (Table 3). In the linear regression analysis (Table 4), BPF levels were significantly
lower in Hispanic children compared to non-Hispanic whites (β
coefficient −0.39, P = 0.001). The opposite
trend was observed for BPS levels, with higher urinary BPS levels
being observed in Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic white children
(β coefficient 0.35, P = 0.03). Urinary levels
of BPF (P = 0.03) in children were associated with
family income in ANOVA (Table 3). As for the adult NHANES 2013–2014 population (Table 2), linear regression
showed a negative association between BPA levels in children and family
incomes, whereby children from the high-family income group had a
lower urinary level of BPA compared to those from the low-family income
group (β coefficient −0.27, P = 0.053; Table 4). These results demonstrate
that complex social, economic, and environmental factors modulate
the exposure of children and adolescents to bisphenols.

Human Health
Implications
Bisphenols are ubiquitous
environmental pollutants,9 and as indicated
by the high detection frequencies in this study, both U.S. adults
and children are continuously exposed to these environmental pollutants.
Exposure patters for BPA across age groups have changed over time,
with children and adolescents having lower exposures relative to adults
in NHANES 2013–2014, suggesting that the replacement of BPA,
especially in food contact materials, has resulted in a reduction
of human exposures to BPA. However, exposures to other bisphenols,
in particular BPS, are growing human health concerns not only because
of the high detection frequency but also because of emerging evidence
that BPS, but not BPF, exposures increase in the U.S. population.28 It is important to note that the associations
between demographic and lifestyle factors and urinary levels of bisphenols
observed in this analysis of the NHANES 2013–2014 data are
complex and cannot be easily explained by the same routes of exposure;
that is, findings for BPA cannot be simply applied to other bisphenols.
Because of the ubiquitous exposure of the U.S. population to BPA,
BPF, and BPS, more research is therefore needed to characterize the
routes of exposure in different segments of the U.S. population and,
ultimately, identify modifiable factors to reduce human exposures
to specific bisphenols.

Experimental Section
NHANES Overview
NHANES is a nationally representative
survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian resident population of
the United States.45 NHANES data are released
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2 year cycles.
Participants are selected using census data based on their age, gender,
and racial/ethnic background through a multistage probability sampling
design. NHANES collects extensive data through questionnaires and
physical examinations to assess the health and nutritional status
of the general U.S. population. Moreover, human biospecimens, such
as blood and urine samples, are collected for laboratory tests during
each cycle, including the measurements of environmental pollutants.
NHANES is reviewed and approved by the National Center for Health
Statistics Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent
is obtained from all participants. A detailed description of NHANES
is available elsewhere.46

For this
study, we analyzed data from the NHANES 2013–2014 cycle (see Table S1 for the sources of the data). BPS and
BPF exposure of the U.S. population was evaluated for the first time
in this cycle, although BPA exposure has been assessed in earlier
cycles.26 The participants of NHANES 2013–2014
(n = 10 175) included 4406 children and 5769
adults. A one-third subsample of participants aged 6 years or older
was randomly selected for the measurements of BPA, BPS, and BPF in
spot urine samples. Ultimately, 2676 participants were included in
our analysis of the NHANES 2013–2014 data after excluding those
with missing data on urinary BPA, BPS, or BPF concentrations.

Analysis
of Total Urinary Levels of BPA, BPF, and BPS
Total urinary
levels of BPA, BPF, and BPS were measured at the Division
of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using published procedures.
Briefly, the total concentration (free and conjugated) of the target
analytes in urine samples was measured after deconjugation at 37 °C
for 4 h with β-glucuronidase/sulfatase (4 mg/mL; 463 000
U/g solid in 1 M ammonium acetate buffer at pH 5; Sigma-Aldrich Laboratories,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The extent of the deconjugation reaction was
assessed by adding a deconjugation standard solution containing 4-methylumbelliferyl
glucuronide, 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate, and 13C4-4-methylumbelliferone (500 ng/mL each; Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA) to all incubation mixtures and monitoring
the 4-methylumbelliferone/13C4-4-methylumbelliferone
peak area ratio after sample incubation as reported previously.47−49 An area count ratio >0.4 was considered acceptable for the deconjugation
reaction of unknown samples.49 Total BPA,
BPF, and BPS were quantified after deconjugation by on-line solid-phase
extraction (SPE)–high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)–mass spectrometry
(MS)/MS in the negative-ion APCI mode. Details of the on-line SPE–HPLC–MS/MS
system and the instrument parameters have been reported previously.47,48 The LODs were 0.2 μg/L for BPA, 0.2 μg/L for BPF, and
0.1 μg/L for BPS. For analytes with levels below the LOD, an
imputed fill value was assigned as the LOD divided by the square root
of 2. All analyses were accompanied by quality assurance/quality control
samples to account for any possible background contamination of the
sampling materials with bisphenols.49 Specifically,
the calculated concentrations of the target analytes in the reagent
blanks were less than three times the LOD. Moreover, all standards,
blanks, and unknown samples were prepared following the same procedure;
thus, the background, represented as the intercept of the calibration
curve, was automatically subtracted during the quantification of all
analytes. In addition to the reagent blanks, two empty vials were
also included with each batch to check for potential background contamination.

Demographic and Lifestyle Factors
Information on demographic
(i.e., age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and family income)
and lifestyle factors (i.e., physical activity, smoking status, and
alcohol intake) of study participants was collected using standardized
questionnaires. Race/ethnicity was categorized based on self-reported
data into Hispanic (including Mexican and non-Mexican Hispanic), non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and other race/ethnicity.37 Family IPRs were categorized as ≤1.30, 1.31–3.50,
and >3.50 based on the cutoff points of the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program.37,50 In accordance with the NHANES
Analytic Guidelines,70 individuals who
smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were defined as
never smokers; those who smoked more than 100 cigarettes but do not
smoke currently were considered ever smokers; and those who currently
smoke cigarettes were classified as current smokers. Alcohol intake
was categorized as 0, 0.1–28, and ≥28 g/day for men
and 0, 0.1–14, and ≥14 g/day for women.51 Self-reported physical activity was used to derive metabolic
equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week and categorized as <600,
600–1200, and >1200 MET min/week.37 A summary of the characteristics of the study participants is provided
in Table 5.

Statistical Analyses
The NHANES uses a complex, multistage
probability sampling design to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized
U.S. population. Therefore, appropriate published sample weights were
applied to account for the differential probability of selection,
nonresponse adjustment, and adjustment to independent population controls.
The Taylor series linearization method was used for variance estimation
to account for stratification and clustering, following the NHANES
Analytic Guidelines.70

We used ANOVA
to compare differences of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and
BPS (log transformed) among various categorical variables. We conducted
linear regression analyses by including all variables simultaneously
in the model to detect independent effects of each variable. Urinary
creatinine levels were adjusted in the model as previously recommended
to account for urine dilution.52 To facilitate
a comparison with other studies, we also report analogous analyses
of urinary bisphenol levels adjusted for creatinine in the Supporting Information (Tables S2 to S5). All
statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (version 9.4;
SAS Institute). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
