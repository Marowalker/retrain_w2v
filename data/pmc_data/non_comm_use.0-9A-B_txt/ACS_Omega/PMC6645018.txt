Cross-metathesis
of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (methyl
oleate (MO), methyl petroselinate (MP), and methyl erucate (ME), obtained
from vegetable oils) with eugenol (obtained from clove oil) proceeded
under green, mild conditions (in 2-propanol or ethanol at 50 °C)
in the presence of a ruthenium-carbene catalyst (called a second-generation
Grubbs catalyst). These metathesis reactions proceeded with both high
conversion (>90% of MO, MP) and selectivity (>98%) even with
low catalyst
loading (0.1 mol % Ru).

Introduction
Olefin metathesis has
been known as an efficient method for synthesis
of various intermediates and fine chemicals;1−16 both cross-metathesis (CM) and ring closing metathesis have been
employed especially for the purpose.1−11 One of the recent promising applications in the olefin metathesis
is the utilization of renewable bio-source materials to complement
or replace petroleum-based specialty chemicals.12−16 In particular, CM of unsaturated fatty acid esters
(shown in Scheme 1),
which are obtained from plant oils or algae-derived feedstocks,1−3,17−20 has been considered as a promising
subject in terms of both green chemistry and oleochemistry.12−16,21−41 Methyl oleate (MO) is the predominant component of fatty acid methyl
esters of the triglycerides in many vegetable oils, such as olive,
canola oil, or Jatropha oil,17−20 and is usually obtained from
the transesterification of vegetable oils with alcohol. Therefore,
considerable attention has been paid for utilization of MO as the
starting material for the production of intermediates and polymer
precursors via CM.30−41 For instance, CM of MO with functionalized olefins, such as allyl
chloride,32 methyl acrylate,33,34 acrylonitrile,35,36 allyl acetate,37 allyl glycidyl ether, and allyltrimethylsilane (ATMS),41 has been studied to obtain renewable α,ω-bifunctional
compounds.

Scheme 1 Typical Unsaturated Fatty Acid Methyl Esters Derived
from Plant Oils
or Algae-Derived Feedstocks, and Eugenol (UG) Obtained from Biomass
Eugenol (UG), featuring a phenolic
allyl benzene (shown in Scheme 1), is also an interesting
bio-based compound. UG is typically obtained from clove oil and has
been widely used not only in foods, perfumes, and antioxidants but
also in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, due to its unique properties
in reducing blood sugar, triglyceride, and cholesterol.42 UG can also be considered as a lignin derivative
and be extracted potentially from lignocellulosic biomass. Moreover,
UG can be easily converted to many types of chemicals owing to its
bifunctional nature. The aliphatic chain and methoxy group (−OCH3) affect the physical properties of polymers derived from
UG,43−45 whereas the hydroxyl (−OH) group and the terminal
olefin provide further chemical modification exemplified in designing
polymer networks via thiol–ene coupling46,47 or bis-maleimide networks,48,49 particularly for performing
metathesis reactions.50 Therefore, reports
concerning self-metathesis (SM)50,51 and CM of UG with symmetrical
internal olefins13,52,53 and electron deficient terminal olefins (such as methyl acrylate,
methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, and with acrylamides)50,52 have been known in the presence of ruthenium catalysts.

The
CM of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters with UG should thus
afford multifunctional products having hydrophobic (long alkyl chain
length) and hydrophilic (phenolic group) properties and/or olefinic
double bonds. These suggest that UG is the promising candidate as
a substrate for the CM reaction with fatty acid methyl esters; however,
comprehensive studies of CM (shown in Scheme 1) still have not been conducted.

In
this paper, we wish to introduce our explored results for CM
of UG with a series of unsaturated
fatty acid methyl esters having an internal double bond, such as MO,
methyl petroselinate (MP), and methyl erucate (ME), and that having
a terminal double bond (methyl 10-undecanoate, MU), in the presence
of ruthenium-carbene catalysts (Scheme 2). We herein present that these CM reactions proceed
efficiently in ethanol, isopropanol, and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)
(environmentally benign solvent) under sustainable conditions, although
these reactions are often conducted either in chlorinated solvents
(dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,2-dichloroethane)54 or aromatic solvents (toluene, benzene, and chlorobenzene).36,51 The influence of reaction conditions (such as time, temperature,
substrate concentration, and ratio of UG/substrate) toward both activity
and selectivity has been investigated in detail.

Results and Discussion
Cross Metathesis of Methyl Oleate (MO) with
Eugenol (UG) Using
Ruthenium Catalysts
MO has been chosen as a model substrate
in this CM with UG using ruthenium-carbene catalysts (shown in Scheme 2, G1, G2, G3, and HG2). Greener
solvents such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethanol, and 2-propanol
were chosen for the purpose of adopting environmentally benign conditions,
although dichloromethane (DCM) or toluene was often used with these
ruthenium catalysts. Table 1 summarizes the selected results conducted under various conditions.a,b As shown in Scheme 2, four types of CM
products (expressed as CM1, CM2, CM3, and CM4) as well as SM products
can be considered in the reaction. 1H- and 13C NMR spectra of the CM products50,55−57 are shown in Figures S17–S26 in
the Supporting Information (SI).a,b

(SI).a,b

It should be noted that the high conversions of MO have been attained
under mild conditions (50 °C) even for a short reaction period
(10 min), when the reaction was conducted in the presence of G2 (Table 1, runs 1–4).b Importantly, the MO conversion
carried out in DCM was relatively close to those carried out in DMC
and 2-propanol.b Moreover, the selectivity of
CM and SM products (defined as select.(2)) in DMC, ethanol, and 2-propanol
is almost identical to that in DCM; the selectivity of CM and SM products
reached almost 98%. The catalytic activities evaluated as turnover
number (TON) values on the basis of metathesis products are higher
than those in the CM reactions of MO with cis-4-octene
(CO), cis-1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene (DAB), and allyltrimethylsilane
(ATMS) reported previously (conducted under similar conditions);41,b the selectivity
of CM products (defined as select.(2)) is close to those in the CM
reactions with ATMS, CO, and DAB.41 It
also turned out that the CM reaction of MO with UG proceeded without
solvent (Table 1, run
5), although the conversion of MO was rather low.c These facts thus clearly indicate that the CM can be performed in
environmentally friendly solvents (such as DMC, 2-propanol, and ethanol)
without decreasing the catalyst efficiency.

On basis of the
above results, DMC, 2-propanol, and ethanol were
chosen for optimization of the reaction conditions (at 50 °C,
the same catalyst loading, reaction time in Table 1). Note that no significant changes in both
MO conversion and selectivity of CM products (defined as select.(1))
were observed upon increasing the MO concentration (runs 7–10).b In contrast, both MO conversion and selectivity
in DMC (run 6) decreased upon increasing the MO concentration. The
CM reaction conducted in ethanol under high MO concentration (10 or
20 M), which was similar to that in 2-propanol with 4.0 M in terms
of both MO conversion and selectivity (runs 8, 9 vs 10), seems to
be thus appropriate for further study.

As shown in Table 2, the MO conversion
in the CM slightly increased over time course
(runs 8, 13, 14), and the conversion reached 96% after 30 min (from
91% after 10 min).b However, a longer reaction
time led to an increase in the percentage of the SM product of UG
(SM4, from 4 to 12%) as well as the degree of isomerization (UG to
isoeugenol) in the reaction mixture (observed on the GC chromatogram, Figure S7 and Table S8, SI),a as reported previously.41 Hence, extension of the reaction time (after
10 min) is not beneficial under these conditions.

h TON = molar amount of metathesis
product from MO (on the basis of MO conv. and select.(1))/Ru (mol).
Detailed analysis data are shown in the SI.a

Moreover, it turned out that the UG/MO molar ratio (10 equiv of
UG to MO) plays an important role in obtaining the CM products with
high selectivity (defined as select.(2), runs 8, 15–17), whereas
high MO conversion could be attained even with 1 equiv of UG (run
15). The high UG/MO ratio is crucial due to the low reactivity of
UG, and this would be mostly considered in ordinary CM (with terminal
olefins) of this type.4−11,41 Consistently, formation of the
SM products was considerably reduced at a high UG/MO molar ratio,a thereby confirming that the SM of MO was inhibited
upon increasing the UG concentration. Further UG addition led to a
decrease in the MO conversion (20 equiv, run 17), probably due to
the increased degree of isomerization of UG observed on the GC chromatogram
(Figure S8, SI).a

It also turned out that the reaction temperature affected
both
reaction rate and selectivity in this catalysis. The MO conversion
at 50 °C reached 90% with exclusive CM selectivity (>98%,
defined
as select.(2), run 8), but the MO conversion was low at room temperature
(25 °C, run 18). No significant improvements in both MO conversion
and CM selectivity were, however, observed at 80 °C, and the
degree of isomerization of UG increased instead (ca. 5 times compared
to that at 50 °C, on the basis of the GC chromatogram, Figure S9 and Table S9, SI).a Isomerization of terminal olefin (to
internal olefin) is often observed in olefin metathesis in the presence
of ruthenium catalysts,4−11,58−61 probably due to catalyst decomposition.
These results revealed that the CM at 50 °C seems to be thus
the appropriate condition in this catalysis.

Table 3 summarizes
CM of MO with UG in the presence of various ruthenium-carbene catalysts
(shown in Scheme 2)
under the optimized conditions (conducted as run 8, in ethanol at
50 °C). Catalyst G2 (called a second-generation
Grubbs catalyst) showed exceptionally better performance and higher
MO conversion in the CM than G1 and G3 (runs
21, 22). The reason for the observed low activity by G1 would be due to catalyst decomposition because G1 is
known to react with ethanol to form Ru-hydride species Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PCy3)2,62 which is active
in olefin isomerization catalysis. Indeed, the reaction with G1 led to the isomerization of UG predominantly (10%, Figure S10, SI).a Moreover,
the conversion of MO and selectivity of CM and SM products (defined
as select.(1)) by HG2 was lower than those by G2 (Table 3, runs 8,
23). An apparent increase in the activity (TONs on the basis of Ru)
was not observed when the CM by G2 was conducted at low
catalyst loading (from 0.1 to 0.05 mol %, runs 8, 20); moreover, an
apparent decrease in the selectivity was not observed under these
conditions.

In summary, CM of MO with UG has been performed with both high
MO conversion and high selectivity of CM products using the G2 catalyst in ethanol (green solvent). Effects of the UG/MO
molar ratio, reaction temperature (50 °C), initial MO concentration
and others (catalyst, time etc.) play a role in obtaining the desired
product in an efficient manner.

Cross-Metathesis (CM) of
Various Methyl Esters (Methyl Petroselinate
(MP), Methylerucate (ME), and Methyl 10-undecanoate (MU)) with Eugenol
(UG)
On the basis of the above results from the CM of MO
with UG, CM of the other unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters such
as MP, ME, and MU with UG was conducted in ethanol in the presence
of G2 (Scheme 3, conditions: Ru 0.1 mol % at 50 °C for 10 min, UG/substrate
= 10 (molar ratio)). The selected results are summarized in Table 4.a As shown in Scheme 3 (as well as explained in Scheme 2), the CM of internal olefins (MP and ME) affords 4
types of CM products (expressed as CM1, CM2, CM3, and CM4), in addition
to SM products. CM of MU with UG should afford one CM product (expressed
as CM1).a

It should be noted that the CM of MP with UG proceeded with both
high activity (920 turnovers after 10 min, high MP conversion) and
exclusive selectivity (>98%, defined as select.(2), run 24).d In contrast, the CM of ME with UG only reached 55%
under the same conditions (run 25, 390 turnovers). However, high ME
conversion (95%), maintaining the exclusive selectivity of CM product
(>99%, defined as select.(2)), could be achieved upon increasing G2 loading (0.2 mol %, run 26), although the percentage of
one CM product (defined CM3), however, decreased upon increasing the
catalyst loading probably due to the second metathesis. These results
clearly indicate that these CM reactions (of MO, MP, and ME) with
UG can be achieved in ethanol in an efficient manner in the presence
of G2.

In contrast, unfortunately, attempted CM
of MU (terminal olefins)
with UG, conducted under the same conditions as those in the CM of
MO (UG/MU = 10, molar ratio), afforded negligible MU conversion (run
27). Further attempts conducted under different MU/UG molar ratios
with high G2 loading improved the MU conversion (up to
83%, run 29), but the yields of the desired CM products were very
low (runs 28, 29), probably due to the subsequent isomerization of
MU in situ leading to other metathesis reactions. In fact, the formation
of the isomerized product of MU (methyl undec-9-enoate) and methyl
11-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)undec-9-enoate (CM1′), which
should be formed by the subsequent CM with UG, in addition to dimethyl
octadec-9-enedioate (SM1′) as the SM product was observed on
the GC chromatogram (Scheme 3 and Figures S15,S16, SI).a

Concluding Remarks
We have shown
that CM reactions of renewable fatty acid methyl
esters (MO, MP, and ME) with UG were successfully conducted by a ruthenium-carbene
catalyst (G2, Scheme 2) under environmentally benign conditions (in isopropanol
or ethanol at 50 °C). The reaction conditions have been optimized
to reach high substrate conversions with high CM selectivity, particularly
for the CM of MO with UG. It turned out that both MO conversion and
selectivity of CM products were highly affected by the initial MO
concentration, UG/MO molar ratio, and reaction temperature. The catalyst
performance was also affected by the substrate employed (in the order
of MP > MO > ME); it thus seems likely that olefinic double
bonds
relatively close to the methyl ester showed better performance in
the CM reaction with UG. It was also revealed that the subsequent
isomerization of either UG or fatty acid methyl esters in situ significantly
affects the CM and the SM product yields.

Experimental Section
All experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere unless
otherwise specified. All chemicals used were of reagent grade and
were purified by the standard purification procedures. Anhydrous grade
dichloromethane (DCM, >99.5%) and n-hexane (Kanto
Chemical Co., Inc.) were transferred into a bottle containing molecular
sieves (mixture of 3A 1/16, 4A 1/8 and 13X 1/16) in a drybox. Ethanol
dehydrated (>99.5%) and 2-propanol dehydrated (>99.7%) were
supplied
by Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. MO (>60%), MU (>96.0%), ME (methyl cis-13-docosenoate, >90.0%), MP (methyl cis-6-octadecenoate, >98.0%), UG (>99.0%), and DMC dehydrated
(>98.0%)
were obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd. and were used
as received. RuCl2(PCy3)2(CHPh) (G1, Cy = cyclohexyl), RuCl2(PCy3)(IMesH2)(CHPh) (G2, IMesH2 = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene),
RuCl2(IMesH2)(CH-2-OiPr-C6H4) (HG2), and RuCl2(PCy3)(IMesH2)(CHPh)(3-BrC5H4N)2 (G3) were used in the drybox as
received (Aldrich Chemical Co.). Methyl heptadecanoate (C17, GC standard,
>99.0%), used as the internal standard (IS) for GC analyses, was
also
purchased from Aldrich.

Analytical GC characterization of mixtures
was performed on GC-2025,
Shimadzu, equipped with a DB-1 column (30 m × 0. 25 mm ×
0.25 μm), using a flame ionization detector. Nitrogen gas was
used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. The oven temperature
program profile was as follows: column oven was kept at 50 °C
for 10 min (initial temperature) and increased at 15 °C/min to
200 °C, and was held for 55 min (a total of 100 min for analyzing
products of MU with UG). The quantitative analyses were performed
by comparing the peak area of the products with a known amount of
methyl heptadecanoate as an IS. The calibration coefficient was determined
by analyzing the mixtures of substrates (MO, MP, ME, and MU) and the
IS with different mass ratios. The amounts of substrates (MO, MP,
ME, and MU) were thus calculated by normalizing using the internal
standard method with the calibration coefficient. The conversion of
substrates (MO, MP, ME, and MU) was estimated from the comparison
of peak areas before and after the reactions. The effective carbon
number (ECN) concept for GC-flame-ionization detector (FID) analyses
was used to calculate the yields of products.63−66 GC–MS analysis was carried
out on a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph directly coupled to a mass
spectrometer (MS) system of Shimadzu GCMS QP5050, equipped with a
DB-1 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, with polyethylene
glycol stationary phase). Helium gas was used as the carrier gas at
a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. The oven temperature program profile was
the same as that employed for the ordinary GC analysis (a total of
100 min for analyzing products of MU with UG).

Thin layer chromatography
(TLC) was carried out glass-backed silica
plates, PLC Silica gel 60 F254, 0.5 mm (dimension 20 × 20 cm,
Merck KGaA). The reaction products were identified by visualizing
the plates under UV light (wavelength 254 nm). Silica gel column chromatography
was carried out using dry silica (size 20–60 μm).

1H- and 13C NMR spectra were obtained by
dissolving the samples in CDCl3 and recording the spectra
using a Bruker AV500 NMR spectrometer (500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C). All spectra were obtained in
the solvent indicated at 25 °C unless otherwise noted. Chemical
shifts (δ) were reported as ppm with tetramethylsilane as the
IS (δ 0.00 ppm, 1H, 13C). The coupling
constants are given in Hz. For 1H NMR and 13C NMR characterization, after solvent evaporation, the metathesis
products of MO with UG were purified by column chromatography on silica
gel (ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures) followed by thin layer chromatography
(TLC, ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures).

Cross-Metathesis Reaction
of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (MO, MP,
ME, and MU) with Eugenol
A typical procedure (Table 1, run 8) is as follows. The
second-generation Grubbs catalyst, RuCl2(PCy3)(H2IMes)(CHPh) (G2, 1.7 mg, 0.1 mol %, 0.0020
mmol), was weighed in a 10 mL vial under a nitrogen atmosphere. Fatty
acid methyl esters (MO (593 mg, 2.00 mmol), ME (706 mg, 2.00 mmol),
MP (593 mg, 2.00 mmol), or MU (397 mg, 2.00 mmol)) and UG (3.284 g,
20.0 mmol, 10 equiv) were dissolved in solvent, and then quickly transferred
to the catalyst vial. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 10
min, then the resulting mixture was passed through a packed column
of Celite. Methyl heptadecanoate (10 mg) as an IS for GC analyses
was added into the obtained filtrate. The mixture was then analyzed
by using the gas chromatograph with the FID (GC-FID) and the gas chromatograph
mass spectrometer (GC–MS). The GC-FID and GC–MS spectra
are shown in the Supporting Information.

For characterization by the NMR spectra, the metathesis products
of MO with UG were purified by column chromatography on silica gel
(ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures) followed by thin layer chromatography
(TLC, ethyl acetate/n-hexane = 2:8 v/v mixtures).
Typical 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of CM products
of MO with UG are shown in the Supporting Information.

a Detailed analysis data including identifications,
GC chromatograms, GC–mass spectrometry (MS) data, and NMR spectra
are shown in the Supporting Information (SI).

b The reviewer commented
that there
are several unknown GC traces on the chromatograms in the Supporting Information. The reaction products
with MO (reagent, MO purity >99% instead of >60% used in the
experiments,
under the same conditions as run 8, Table 1; 590 turnovers, selectivity of metathesis
products on the basis of MO conversion {defined as select.(1)} = 65%)
consisted of the CM products (major, 99%) in addition to SM products
(minor) with high selectivity (910 turnovers, selectivity of metathesis
products on the basis of MO conversion = 96%, Table S10). The observed difference would probably be due
to impurities in MO. The chromatogram is shown in the Supporting Information.

c Reason for the low MO conversion in
the CM without solvent (run 5, Table 1) is not clear at this moment.

d Observed catalytic activity (920 turnovers)
in the CM of MP (>98% purity) with UG was, in fact, close to that
(910 turnovers) in the CM of MO (>99% purity), with UG conducted
under
the same conditions (shown in Table S10 in the SI).b
