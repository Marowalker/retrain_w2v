Prolonged testing of the new xerogel photocatalytic
coating AquaSun applied to a surface probe immersed in ocean water
irradiated with simulated solar radiation shows excellent action against
biofouling. Activated by moderate solar radiation, the organosilica
film has also good antimicrobial properties. Considering the high
stability, the environmental footprint, and the low cost of this sol–gel
marine coating, the technology has significant potential toward replacing
conventional antifouling and foul-release coatings with a single product
of broad applicability.

1 Introduction
Every year, more than 80 000 tonnes of marine antifouling
(AF) paints, mostly copper-based, are used across the world to protect
vessels of any size and scope,1 posing
a serious threat to the environment. Intense research works carried
out at both antifouling coating makers and in academic research centers
have actually resulted in the development of several environmentally
benign alternatives, mostly based on foul-release (FR) polymeric coatings,
but also including formulations, whose action is based on less toxic
biocides.2−4

Foul-release (FR) waterborne xerogel coatings
composed of organically
modified silica (ORMOSIL) are among the environmentally benign solutions
identified.5−7 Their action is based on the ability to form a thin hydrophobic protective
layer, to which biofouling sticks loosely to be released even at low
cruising speed. Their main limitation is due to their limited antifouling
action when the vessel is in harbor for prolonged periods.

Aiming
to develop a coating capable of providing full protection
to ships, recreational boats, and underwater structures against marine
biofouling, we have recently reported the promising discovery that
nanoflower-like Bi2WO6 encapsulated in methyl-modified
silica shows excellent photocatalytic antifouling action leading to
the formation of hydrogen peroxide.8−11 Hydrogen peroxide is a strong
and clean oxidant decomposing into water and oxygen,12 able to rapidly degrade the (bio)organic species adsorbed
onto the film, making the surface inhospitable to the settling larvae
of fouling organisms, by a free-radical intermediate that prevents
the attachment of hard foulants.13 This
semiconductor is highly active under visible radiation and thus it
overperforms TiO2-based semiconductors, which have been
proposed in the past for analogous applications.14,15

Dubbed AquaSun, the recently developed Bi2WO6 coating, typically forms a transparent thin film (3 μm
thick)
of methylsilica, in which the particles of the semiconductor are homogeneously
encapsulated within the ORMOSIL matrix, retaining their flowerlike
nanostructure. Using uracil as representative molecular precursor
of biofouling, we showed that under irradiation with solar light,
the coating degraded about half of 1 ppm uracil in 3 days. No wolframate
leaching was observed into the supernatant solution, even after 3
months immersion and after repeated irradiation cycles. Remarkably,
furthermore, the activity degradation rate was found to be linear,
pointing to no saturation effects or prolonged absorption of the substrate.
Indeed, further investigation using adenine as probe revealed good
foul-release properties of the coating, with all adenine adsorbed
from a 1 ppm solution being released in 2 h upon immersion in water,
even in the absence of light irradiation. Now, we show the efficiency
of this new coating in real-life tests conducted for 122 days in seawater
obtained from Al Raha Beach, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental Runs in Seawater
The
waterborne coating was sol–gel-derived through hydrolytic polycondensation,
under acidic conditions, of a sol containing 50 mol % tetraethoxysilane
and 50 mol % methyl-triethoxysilane, to which flowerlike nanostructured
Bi2WO6 was added (50 mM) as previously described.4 Runs were performed in a 2.5 L beaker using seawater
(1.5 L) placed in contact with glass slides after getting rid of most
sand particles through sedimentation. Bare and functionalized glass
slides were used under two different conditions: (A) no applied radiation,
meaning that only the low diffuse radiation present in the laboratory
reached the solution and (B) under intermittent irradiation with 500
W simulated solar light (LOT Quantum Design LS0606, equipped with
a Xenon short-arc lamp and AM1.5G filter). In the latter case, water
evaporation was not negligible. Consequently, an aliquot of seawater
(around 100 mL) was poured in the beaker to replenish the original
amount around every 10 days since the beginning of the experiment.
The overall experiment lasted 122 days.

In experiment B, the
radiation intensities were 2.8 W/m2 in the wavelength range
of 315–400 nm and 60 W/m2 in the wavelength range
of 450–950 nm. Irradiation was applied every day for the number
of hours indicated in Table 1 (total number of hours under simulated solar light was 585.5).
In Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2), the visible light (VL) radiation
intensity (wavelength range: 400–1050 nm) in the laboratory
during a working day and the visible light irradiation intensity (wavelength
range: 400–1050 nm) in the laboratory during a public holiday
are reported. Radiation intensity was measured with a Delta Ohm 9721
radiometer and the matching probes. The duration of irradiation per
day is not constant along the 122 days, but the samples were all exposed
to light contemporaneously so that the results are comparable. The
characteristics of the seawater were analyzed with a Shimadzu TOC-L
total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer, a Delta Ohm pH-χ-O2 meter (model HD22569.2), an ion chromatography system Dionex
ICS-5000, and a HACH 2100AN turbidimeter. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the
characteristics of the seawater at the beginning (day 0) and end (day
122) of the experiments. It can be noticed that the salinity increased
significantly at the end of experiment B due to evaporation of water
under irradiation, resulting in a concentration of the ionic species.

2.2 Experimental Runs in Luria–Bertani
(LB) Medium
Photocatalytic antimicrobial effect of AquaSun
against Escherichia coli was evaluated
in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium. In this study, E. coliDH5α, used as model
bacteria, was first precultured in 5 mL of LB medium for 18 h at 37
°C in LB medium. Prior to the experiments, all glassware were
autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C to ensure the sterility. An aliquot
(100 μL) of E. coli cell culture
was cultured in 15 mL of LB medium for 15 h at 37 °C and agitated
at 120 rpm. The experiments to assess photocatalytic antimicrobial
effect were carried out using a flat visible 33.1 W light-emitting
diode (LED) source emitting at wavelengths greater than 425 nm. The
light was then focused onto a glass tube containing a suspension of
bacterial cells and bismuth tungstate-based film. During experiments,
the antibacterial effect of film against E. coli growth was measured every hour by the optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific model #810S UV–vis-Bio). LB medium without
bacterial suspension, a bacterial suspension without the photocatalyst,
and a bacterial suspension in the presence of bare glass slide were
also irradiated as a controls. In addition, the control suspensions
and the reaction mixture were kept in the dark to have a dark control.
The results were plotted on a semilogarithmic graph to obtain a growth
curve as optical density (Y) versus time (X). From the curve, the specific growth rates were calculated.

2.3 Characterization of the Coating
Diffuse
reflectance spectra were measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu UV-2600) in the wavelength range of 350–750 nm. The
photoluminescence (PL) spectra in emission mode with an excitation
at 300 nm were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrometer between
310 and 600 nm (200 nm/min scan rate). Raman spectra were recorded
with a Witec Alpha 300R equipment, with an excitation wavelength of
532 nm and a laser power of ca. 75 mW. Scans were taken over an extended
range (100–2000 cm–1) with 5 s integration
time and 30 accumulations. Raman mapping was done with 0.1 s integration
time. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation was carried
out with an FEI Nova NanoSEM 650 microscope. A CSI Nano-Observer atomic
force microscopy (AFM) microscope was operated in amplitude modulation
mode, and standard Asylum Research AC160TS-R3 cantilevers (k ≈ 26 N/m, f ≈ 300 kHz)
were used for the AFM experiments. An area of 49 μm2 of the sample surface was scanned at a rate of 0.75 ln/s.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Performance in Seawater
Under solar
light, marine phytoplankton microorganisms give place to photosynthesis,
providing organic matter for the organisms that comprise the majority
of marine life,16 consuming inorganic carbon.
For this reason, in experiment B, the total organic carbon (TOC) increased
and the inorganic carbon (IC) decreased when comparing the initial
and final concentrations. Nevertheless, the total carbon (TC) is reduced
because the thin film under visible light is able to mineralize organic
matter with the formation of carbon dioxide, which evolves from the
supernatant solution.1

Conversely,
in experiment A, the values of TC, IC, and TOC before and after each
run are substantially the same, which is due to the insufficient radiation,
thereby proving that degradation is due to the photocatalytically
formed hydrogen peroxide achievable only by irradiating with (simulated)
solar light. When the film is applied on a surface constantly exposed
to solar radiation, it continuously produces H2O2 according to eqs 1–5, where h+ are the holes generated in
the valence band of the semiconductor and e– are
the electrons formed in the conduction band17 1   2   3   4   5  Comparison between
the UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra of the bare glass slide and the glass slide functionalized
with the AquaSun coating (Figure 1) highlights a minor shift of the latter because, under
simulated solar light, the film functionalized with the coating is
much cleaner than the unprotected glass.

Figure 1 Diffuse reflectance spectra
of bare glass and functionalized glass
(labeled as “film”) in the presence of simulated solar
light. SS stands for “solar simulator” and it refers
to experiment B.

The effect of the solar
light on the glass slide functionalized
with the AquaSun thin film is evident in Figure 2, showing that the coated glass, when exposed
to the low diffuse radiation present in the laboratory room, undergoes
the growth of biomass on its surface because after 4 months (day 122)
two significant peaks (around 440 and 675 nm) appear in the diffuse
reflectance spectrum. Accordingly, the TC, IC, and TOC values at the
end of the test in seawater did not decrease: a crucially important
result that was visually confirmed (Figure 3).

glass (labeled as
film) in the absence or in the presence of simulated solar light.
SS stands for solar simulator and it indicates experiment B.

Figure 3 Area of the film (indicated by the blue oval)
where a biomass layer
deposited because of the low irradiation.

The presence of the biomass also affects the photoluminescence
(PL) of the film. The PL spectrum of the functionalized glass shows
a peak around 420 nm (Figure 4), which is clearly stronger when the film was exposed to
room light in comparison to the peak shown by the coated glass exposed
to simulated solar irradiation. Indeed, it is known that some marine
microorganisms, such as algae, can produce photoluminescence emission
in the visible region due to the proteins or aromatic amino acid,
and their metabolites.18

Figure 5 depicts
the Raman spectra of both bare and functionalized glass before (day
0) and after the experiments (day 122).

Figure 5 Raman spectra of functionalized
(labeled as film) and bare glass
before (day 0) and after 122 days in the absence and in the presence
of simulated solar light. SS stands for solar simulator and it refers
to experiments B. The curves related to the “film day 122”
were obtained by pointing Raman laser on the circles 1 and 2 in Figure 6a.

The glass coated with AquaSun coating exhibits
three peaks (at
ca. 161, 311, and 799 cm–1) attributable to Bi2WO6 encapsulated in the ORMOSIL19 and two peaks (around 560 and 1095 cm–1) due to the glass substrate.

In experiment B, the functionalized
film after 4 months shows the
same Raman spectrum as day 0. On the contrary, the bare glass spectrum
displays several new peaks. The film of experiment A affords two different
types of spectra according to where the laser beam is pointed. One
(corresponding to circle 1 in Figure 6a) is identical to
the spectrum on day 0. Another (corresponding to circle 2 in Figure 6a) displays a much
larger background intensity (top curve in Figure 5). This spectrum results from biomass, which
has been produced because of the poor illumination in the room, and
is caused by the photoluminescence of the biomass itself (in agreement
with Figure 4), which
covers completely the signals of Bi2WO6.

Figure 6 Optical images
(100× magnification) of the films after 122 days in the absence (a) and in the presence (b)
of simulated solar light; 799 cm–1 peak Raman mapping
(c, d) corresponding to the images in (a) and (b), respectively. Circles
1 and 2 indicate where the laser has been pointed during the recording
of the curves labeled as film day 122 in Figure 5. The scale bar is 10 μm.

Remarkably, these two populations of spectra obtained
from the
film irradiated by room light only are clearly distinguishable in Figure 6c, where the Raman
mapping of 799 cm–1 peak is displayed: the area
where the biomass is abundant gives a stronger intensity, and this
is a further confirmation that the far more intense signal of the
black curve in Figure 5 is due to the biomass. On the other hand, the Raman mapping of the
film exposed to solar light indicates a homogeneous surface, highlighting
the absence of biomass in that surface, with a Raman spectrum which
does not change with the area analyzed, and a signal intensity far
lower than the one given by the film with accumulated biomass.

Further proof of AquaSun inhibition of the biomass formation on
the surface faced to solar light is given by SEM analysis (Figure 7). No relevant differences
are observed in the glass coated with AquaSun on day 0 and after 122
days under the conditions of experiment B (Figure 7a,b, respectively). Conversely, the film
exposed to room light after 122 days is significantly populated by
biomass (Figure 7c).
As with regard to the bare (unprotected) glass in experiment B, the
SEM image (Figure 7d and inset) demonstrates the presence of microorganisms with a circular
shape, closely resembling a planktonic diatom.

Figure 7 SEM images at 25 000×
magnification of the functionalized
glass on day 0 (a), after experiment B (b), and after experiment A
(c). SEM image at 8000× magnification of the bare glass after
experiment B (d).

It is worth reminding
that the photocatalytic reaction on the submarine
surface is triggered by visible light radiation, which easily penetrates
seawater, with reflection at moderate depths accounting to only 5–10%
and with a negligible absorption.20

The conclusive evidence of the efficacy of AquaSun under solar
light is proved by AFM characterization of the functionalized glasses
after experiments (Figure 8). The morphology of the film is affected by the presence
of biomass, which can be seen in Figure 8c; also the surface root-mean-square roughness
was about 48.5 nm after experiment A, whereas the same value was 88.0
nm after experiment B, pointing to a smoothening effect of biomass
deposited on the surface.

Figure 8 AFM topography and related AFM phase mapping
of the functionalized
glass after experiment B (a, b) and after experiment A (c, d). The
insets show the relative abundance of phases.

The matching phase mapping of the two samples showed significant
differences. Under simulated solar light, the phase versus counts
curve, indicating, namely, the relative abundance of different phases,
reported only one main distribution having a maximum around 95°,
which can be attributed to the AquaSun coating (see inset of Figure 8b). The slight negative
skew is because the coating is a composite material (nanoflower-like
Bi2WO6 encapsulated in methyl-modified silica).
On the contrary, after experiment A, the same graph showed two distinct
distributions (orange and green areas in the inset of Figure 8d), pointing to the heterogeneity
of the surface, where two different materials can be recognized: the
AquaSun coating (maximum at 120°) and the biomass (maximum at
258°). Integration of the curve gives the following ratio: AquaSun
89%, biomass 11%.

3.2 Performance in Luria–Bertani
Medium
The photocatalytic antimicrobial effect of functionalized
films
was evaluated by the specific growth rate of E. coli in LB medium under visible light (VL) irradiation by comparing a
bacterial suspension without the photocatalyst and a bacterial suspension
kept in the presence of a bare glass slide, both under visible light
irradiation and in the dark. As shown in Table 4, in the dark, the changes in the specific
growth rate of E. coli were negligible,
indicating that the photocatalyst itself had no antimicrobial effect
on the growth rate of E. coli. Moreover,
a control experiment without photocatalyst, with only E. coli, and E. coli with bare glass under visible light irradiation indicated that the
specific growth rate increased compared to E. coli in the dark. On the other hand,
the specific growth rate of E. coli in the presence of the functionalized glass under visible light
was reduced by about 16% compared to the irradiated bare glass and E. coli.

3.3 Benefits over Current Coatings for Marine
Applications
To assist in the process of identifying alternatives
to be used as substitutes to replace copper-based antifouling technology,
which is of high environmental concern, we provide a brief insight
on how the use of AquaSun ensures that copper is not being replaced
with equal or more hazardous alternative, thereby getting ahead of
new bans or restrictions. For example,
phase out of copper-based antifouling paints on recreational vessels
less than 65 feet in length by 2020 was adopted by the State of Washington
in the United States, where salmon fisheries generate $3.18 billion
of economic activity each year, supporting over 17 000 jobs,
with even 2 ppb levels of copper interfering with a salmon’s
ability to avoid predators and also adversely impacting the ability
of fish eggs and fry to develop normally.21

The components of the new antifouling product are Bi2WO6 and the encapsulant methylsilica matrix. The only
acute effect recorded in Material Safety Data Sheet for Bi2WO6 is moderate irritation of the respiratory system following
inhalation and low toxicity following ingestion due to its insoluble
nature. The complete lack of solubility in water is most promising
for what concerns its aquatic toxicity and ecotoxicity (persistence
in the environment and bioaccumulation). In general, bismuth is a
heavy-metal element with unusually low toxicity, obtained as a byproduct
of extraction of other metals, including tungsten, used in many common
stomach remedies and cosmetic products.22 Tungsten, in its turn, does not constitute an important health hazard.23 The tungstate anion WO42– isomorph to molybdate antagonizes the normal metabolic action of
isomorph molybdate MoO42– as metal carrier.

Finally, the low cost, facile preparation with high purity, high
stability in various electrolytes, and resistance to photocorrosion
makes Bi2WO6 ideally suited for application
in photocatalytic wastewater treatment.24 Sol–gel-derived methylsilica is an eminent ORMOSIL. Due to
their inertness and excellent textural properties, these materials
are used as carriers for drugs and bioactive agents,25 with ORMOSIL nanoparticles generally being of little or
no toxicity.26 Methyl-modified silica is
highly stable in water and even more in seawater, whose pH is limited
to the range of 7.5–8.4, with similar methyl-modified silica
coatings functionalized with silver ions, for example, currently being
considered for as antibacterial coatings on surgical-grade stainless
steel.27

4 Outlook
and Conclusions
The AquaSun coating composed of a methyl-modified
silica xerogel
functionalized with encapsulated Bi2WO6 effectively
prevents the accumulation of biomass on glass in a real seawater environment
in prolonged testing lasting up to 4 months. Extensive Raman mapping
characterization of the coating highlights the formation of biomass
on selected areas of the coated glass probe only when diffuse visible
light radiation reaches the surface, whereas unprotected glass was
found covered with diatoms. Exposing the coating to visible light
radiation using simulated solar light even for a few hours per day
(2.5, 5, and 8 h for 122 consecutive days) at moderate UV–vis
radiation (2.8 and 60 W/m2 in the UV and visible regions,
respectively) prevents the formation of any biofilm with a significant
reduction in the total amounts of inorganic carbon in water and a
concomitant increase of dissolved organic carbon due to ongoing photosynthesis.
Moreover, under pure visible radiation, the coated film mitigates
bacterial growth in an E. coli culture
growth on the coated glass. The mean annual values of the solar radiation
flux into the ocean (over the sea surface) vary between 230 W m/m2above the equator through 40 W m/m2 at the pole,28 whereas visible light radiation easily penetrates
seawater with negligible absorption and with reflection at moderate
depths accounting to only 5–10%.

In general, the high
chemical and physical stability of foul-release
sol–gel coatings generally affords long-lasting protection,
significantly reducing the need for maintenance on functionalized
surfaces. Being a waterborne xerogel organosilica coating,29 AquaSun is compatible with most of the surfaces
(steel, fiberglass, aluminum, wood, etc.) by spraying or brushing,
eliminating the need to handle dangerous paint formulations, curing
at room temperature. Forthcoming trials in the open sea will be aimed
to identify the optimal application parameters for different navigating
vessels. This technology is potentially ready to enter the market
soon thanks to its high performance, enabling the protection of the
aquatic environment and ultimately human health, at the same time
preserving surfaces from fouling. These results, in conclusion, may
open the route to the future employment of the AquaSun coating sol–gel
technology for the protection of different surfaces constantly submerged
in sea, lake, and river waters.
