Increased deformability and softness
endow tumor cells with highly
invasive and metastatic capabilities. We exploited these characteristics
to fabricate a high-throughput microfluidic device to measure cell
deformability and separate cancer cells. Driven by hydrodynamic forces,
the cells with better deformability passed through the chip faster,
whereas stiffer cells passed through the device over a longer time
period. The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines were used to evaluate
the device because their metastatic potentials were known. We found
that MDA-MB-231 cells, which were softer and exhibited stronger deformability,
passed through the device more quickly. HeLa cells were also successfully
separated into softer and stiffer subpopulations, whose distinct mechanical
properties were confirmed by atomic force microscopy. We also measured
the expression of metastasis-associated proteins (epidermal growth
factor receptor and integrin β 1) and found that subpopulations
with varied deformabilities had different expression levels. Our results
suggested that this high-throughput microfluidic device could be used
to screen and evaluate the curative effects of drug and cancer progression
by simultaneously testing cell deformability and expression levels
of metastasis-associated proteins in separated cell subpopulations.

1 Introduction
Metastasis is the defining
feature of cancer that involves the
spread of tumor cells from a primary site to secondary tissues or
organs and represents the main cause of cancer deaths.1,2 In addition to genetic and external environmental factors, metastasis
is partially dependent on the mechanical properties of cancer cells.3 Successfully surviving and moving in the harsh
and changing environments of the vasculature, lymphatic vessels, and
stromal space requires that malignant tumor cells possess appropriately
softer mechanical properties.3 These properties
are determined by biophysical measurements, and cellular softness
correlates with greater metastatic probability.4,5 It
is suggested that mechanical properties can be used as diagnostic
markers of the metastatic potential of cancer cells.6,7

The mechanical properties of cells can be estimated by evaluating
their elasticity and viscosity using approaches such as micropipette
aspiration,8,9 atomic force microscopy (AFM),10,11 optical tweezers,12,13 and so on. AFM and optical tweezer
measurements are very accurate and provide quantitative data;11,12 however, they are extremely low throughput and require highly skilled
operators. In micropipette aspiration, a cell is aspirated into a
micropipette under negative pressure.8 This
approach provides fairly accurate results with higher throughput than
the two previously mentioned techniques, but it is still very slow,
with a maximum throughput of a few cells/h.8,9 Microfluidic
devices with microchannels are used to estimate cellular mechanical
properties by measuring migration time and the entry velocity of single
cells into a microchannel.14−21 This technology increases throughput but generally cannot distinguish
and separate cell subpopulations with varied mechanical properties
for further assays.

Some researchers have suggested that optimal
mechanical properties
for invasion and intravasation are inheritable cellular characteristics.7,22 This theory suggests that molecular targets could be used to track
such malignant features. Mechanical signals act as mechanoreceptors
and mediate mechanotransduction by transferring forces to specialized
anchoring structures.23 For example, high
integrin β 1 levels activate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
and increase invasive ability.22 High expression
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is also required for cell
migration24 and survival.25 Greater EGFR expression on the surface of cancer cells
is associated with the degree of tumor deterioration,26 but no studies have examined the association with EGFR
expression and mechanical properties due to cell sorting limitations.
EGFR and integrin β 1 expression levels are useful references
to evaluate malignancy and cancer progression. In this study, we designed
and developed a microfluidic device with microbarriers to separate
and enrich cells with variable mechanical properties and used fluorescence
signals to simultaneously detect EGFR and integrin expression in the
separated subpopulations of cancer cells.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Chip Design and Operation
The chip
microstructures and fluidic parameters of the device are both essential
to separate cancer cells. The device’s most notable feature
is the increasingly sized placement of gaps to impede or allow the
passage of cells with variable mechanical properties. Researchers
suggested that the minimum passable blood capillary barrier for cancer
cells in vivo is approximately 8 μm.27,28 We took this value into account when designing the chip to separate
cells. Following the direction of fluid flow, the gaps decreased from
15 to 7 μm, allowing continuous analysis efficiency (Figure 1).

separation chip. (A) Overall scheme of
the separation chip with the gaps ranging in size from 15 to 7 μm.
(B) Detailed scheme of the separation chip. (C) Pattern of cell flow
in a chip, resulting in continuous cell movement and deformation in
this device.

The chip was patterned
and fabricated by mechanical microfabrication.
A Tygon tube was connected to the chip to allow cells to be injected
into the chip. A microinjection pump was used to control the flow
rate at 1 mL/h. Chip-separated cells could be imaged by microscopy.
The cells that flowed from the chip were collected and then subjected
to protein expression analysis and immunofluorescence staining assays,
and cells blocked in the chip were subjected to immunofluorescence
staining assays.

The device employs hydrodynamic force to define
cancer cell mechanical
properties (Figure 1). The gap size distribution from first to ninth arrays ranges from
15 to 7 μm, respectively (Figure 1A). The diameter of the middle blocking column is 15
μm (Figure 1B).
Each array region consists of 100 rows of blocking columns. Cell flow
through these gaps requires continuous movement and deformation (Figure 1C).

2.2 On-Chip Cell Analysis
The chip was
used to separate and analyze the mechanical properties of two breast
cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The mechanical properties
of these lines have been quantified and confirmed by optical deformability
assays in previous studies.10,29 MDA-MB-231 is a mesenchymal-like
breast cancer cell line with greater softness,7 whereas the epithelium-like MCF-7 line is stiffer. Cell suspensions
at the density of 1 × 103 cells/mL were prepared and
injected into the chip, and the numbers of retained cells in each
array were counted. From the first (15 μm gap) to the fifth
array (11 μm gap), more MCF-7 cells were blocked than MDA-MB-231
cells. From the sixth (10 μm gap) to the ninth array (7 μm
gap), MDA-MB-231 cells were trapped but in lower numbers compared
with MCF-7 cells (Table 1). The statistical data for each gap array revealed a greater blocking
rate as the gap diameter decreased, confirming that each array trapped
cellular subpopulations with different mechanical properties.

Table 1 Retained Rates ± Standard Error
(SE, %) of Two Cells in Each Gap Array
gaps (μm)	15	14	13	12	11	10	9	8	7	
MCF-7	0	0	0.1 ± 0.04	0.1 ± 0.01	0.2 ± 0.01	0.1 ± 0.01	0.3 ± 0.03	24 ± 2.31	42 ± 2.19	
MDA-MB-231	0	0	0	0.1 ± 0.04	0	0.2 ± 0.04	0.1 ± 0.05	16 ± 2.65	33 ± 2.08	
Trapped cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2). In the 15 μm
array (7 μm gap) of the chip, more MCF-7 cells were trapped
than MDA-MB-231 cells. Fluorescent MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells present
diverse morphologies, which implies that the device successfully separates
cell populations with different mechanical properties.

arrays in the chip. The left line is
the image of MCF-7 cells in 12 and 7 μm arrays, and the right
image is the MDA-MB-231 cells. The scale bar is 100 μm.

2.3 Young’s
Modulus Measurement by AFM
More MCF-7 cells were blocked
in the chip, whereas more MDA-MB-231
cells flowed through (Table 2). This result indicated that MDA-MB-231 cells were softer,
with higher deformability.

and MDA-MB-231
Cells Passing through the Chip
cells	passing rate
(%)	SE	
MCF-7	4.31	0.32	
MDA-MB-231	8.83	1.47	
Stiffness is quantitatively evaluated using Young’s
modulus
or the elastic modulus. AFM was used to measure Young’s modulus
of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Considering the thickness of the attached
cells, we calculated Young’s modulus at a 500 nm indentation
depth to decrease disturbance at the bottom of the dish (adherent
cell height is ∼1.5 μm29).
The average value of Young’s modulus for MDA-MB-231 cells was
significantly lower than that of MCF-7 cells10 (Figure 3).

modulus of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells that passed
through the chips. * means p < 0.05.

2.4 Separated Cell Subpopulation
Analyses
The HeLa cell line was used to explore device separation
of cancer
cell subpopulations based on mechanical properties. Five minutes after
injection, HeLa cells trapped in the ninth array were imaged (Figure 4). The red arrow
indicates a stiffer cell with limited deformability, whereas the green
arrow points to a more flexible dumbbell-shaped cell with relatively
higher deformability allowing it to pass through the gap. The results
show that cell subpopulations with variable mechanical properties
can be separated in the different chip arrays.

Figure 4 Magnified field showing
the deformed cells in the gap of 8 μm.
The red arrow points to a stiff cell with limited deformability trapped
in the chip. The green arrow points to a malleable cell with good
deformability.

The mechanical properties
of HeLa cells that pass through the chip
at different times can be estimated by AFM with spherical probes.
Cells that passed through the chip after 5 and 30 min were collected,
whereas those not separated by the chip were used as a control (labeled
as N). Compared with the control group, we observed
statistically significant reductions of Young’s modulus (N group: 0.257 ± 0.05 kPa,30 30 min group: 0.227 ± 0.01 kPa, 5 min group: 0.209 ± 0.05
kPa, p < 0.01; Figure 5). The results confirmed that cells that
passed through the chip after 5 min were the softest among the three
groups. The cells in the 30 min group were obviously softer than cells
that were not separated by the chip.

One hundred curves were acquired,
including 50 cells randomly for each group. The statistical significance
values are from comparison with the control group. **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05.

2.5 Protein Expression of Cell Subpopulations
To further explore whether EGFR and integrin expression levels
correlated with deformability, we performed flow cytometry and western
blotting to detect metastatic-associated proteins in separated subpopulations
(Figure 6). Although
flow cytometry testing requires a large supply of cells, we still
collected the cells that passed through the chip during different
time points (normal culture and passed through the chip for 5 and
30 min) to test and verify the accuracy of this microfluidic chip
for the detection and separation of cell subpopulations of varied
deformability. EGFR and integrin expression levels measured by flow
cytometry are shown in Figure 6A,B. From the results, we found that HeLa cells that passed
through the chip within 5 min had the highest integrin β 1 levels
among the three groups (Figure 6A). HeLa cells that passed through the chip within 5 min had
the highest EGFR levels among the three groups; however, numerical
comparison revealed that there are no significant differences. This
result may be related to finding the small cell numbers in every sample
passing through the device (Figure 6B). To further verify the accuracy of the results,
we collected subgroups of cells through repeated experiments to accumulate
enough cells for western blotting. The results showed that the protein
expression of each group exhibited significant differences. Western
blotting confirmed the flow cytometry results for integrin (Figure 6C), and EGFR (Figure 6D) showed significantly
higher expression in the 5 min group. Notably, integrin β 1
and EGFR expressions are highly relevant to mechanical properties.
Cell subpopulations with relatively higher EGFR and integrin β
1 expression were softer and more deformable, enabling them to pass
through the chip more quickly.

overexpressed proteins.

and passed through the chip for 5 and 30 min.

2.6 Cell Subpopulation Analysis in One Chip
Gold cluster probe-based assays have been applied for protein quantitative
analyses. The peptide YHWYGYTPQNVI is a specific target sequence for
EGFR. Compared with fluorescent dye analysis, the fluorescence of
the gold cluster was less likely to quench; thus, the analysis accuracy
using fluorescence intensity is improved.31,32 In the present work, a gold cluster probe was used to target EGFR
expressed on trapped HeLa cells in different arrays on the chip. Cells
blocked in the chips were labeled with the probe and then fixed. Forty
images in each array (from the sixth to the ninth) were collected
by inverted fluorescence microscopy for statistical analyses. Figure 7A shows the merged
bright-field and fluorescence images, and Figure 7B depicts the corresponding fluorescence
intensity histogram. Greater EGFR expression corresponded with enhanced
fluorescence intensity (normalized to the substrate), and the signal
change was imaged and analyzed. The images are displayed by MATLAB
software as data cube histograms (Figure 7B). The highest fluorescence intensity value
for cells in the ninth array was higher than that in the other arrays.
The statistical analysis also revealed that the cell subpopulation
in the ninth array had higher EGFR expression than those in the sixth
to eighth arrays. The relatively high EGFR expression was confirmed
to correspond with cell deformability. This finding demonstrates that
we successfully separated subpopulations of HeLa cells with varied
mechanical properties and confirmed that EGFR expression correlated
with cell deformability.

3 Conclusions
We designed
and fabricated a novel microfluidic device to exploit
unique mechanical properties to separate and analyze cancer cell subpopulations.
The distinct mechanical properties and expression of metastasis-associated
proteins in these cell subpopulations were verified by AFM analysis,
flow cytometry, and western blotting assays. These results provide
support for using the chip as a screening or diagnostic tool to explore
connections between cancer progression and mechanical properties of
cell subpopulations by testing cancer cell deformability. The device
may be used as a supplement for clinical high-throughput detection
and could be integrated with other analyses to identify cells associated
with invasion, metastasis, and cancer progression.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Cell Culture
A
human cervical cancer
cell line (HeLa cells) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7) were purchased from the Cell Bank of Xiehe. HeLa cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with
high glucose (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories) and then incubated at 37 °C
in a humidified incubator containing 5% wt/vol CO2. The
cell density was determined using a hemocytometer prior to any experiments.

4.2 Microfluidic Chip Design and Fabrication
The microchip pattern was designed on glass slides. The width of
the chip channel was 2 mm. The size limitation in the channel is achieved
by the compact arrangement of small columns (the diameter is 15 μm).
The gaps decreased from 15 to 7 μm from the left to right of
the chip (see the gap size distribution in Figure 1: array 1, 15 μm; array 2, 14 μm;
array 3, 13 μm; array 4, 12 μm; array 5, 11 μm;
array 6, 10 μm; array 7, 9 μm; array 8, 8 μm; and
array 9, 7 μm).

Microfluidic channel patterns and the
corresponding master were designed and fabricated by mechanical microfabrication.
Sylgard 184 PDMS (Dow Corning) precursor was mixed thoroughly with
its curing agent (Dow Corning) at 10:1 (w/w) and degassed by vacuum
for 30 min. The precursor mixture was cast against the silicon mold
and polymerized at 65 °C for 3 h in a vacuum drying oven (Yiheng
Scientific Instrument Co., LTD., Shanghai, China). The cured poly(dimethylsiloxane)
replica was then gently peeled from the master, and the columnar inlet
and outlet were manually drilled for each channel and reversibly sealed
against a clean microscope cover glass to form a microfluidic chip.
The liquids were pumped into the microfluidic chip via syringe pumps
(Longer Inc., China).33

4.3 Sample Preparation
To evaluate the
device’s enrichment efficiency, HeLa cells were incubated and
resuspended at a specific concentration in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to reduce the
cell aggregation.

4.4 Experimental Setup
A syringe pump
was used to inject the prepared sample continuously into the microchannel.
The flow rate was initiated at 1 mL/h to observe the enrichment efficiency
and to count the number of collected cells in the chip in the microscope.
Then, to identify the cancer cells, the cells were stained with antibodies
(EGFR and integrin β 1, Abcam) before capture.

4.5 Flow Cytometry Analysis
Cells were
suspended in PBS containing 2% FBS with antibody staining. Antibodies
against integrin β 1 and EGFR were diluted 1:100. Isotype control
antibodies were used as the gating controls.

4.6 Protein
Expression Analysis
Cells
separated at different time points were suspended in PBS by scraping
and were lysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology,
China). The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic
acid protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The separated
proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes
(0.2 μm, Whatman, U.K.). The membranes were then blocked with
5% BSA in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated
with primary antibodies (mouse anti-EGFR antibody, 1:100 dilution,
and mouse anti-integrin β 1 antibody, 1:200 dilution, Abcam)
at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were rinsed three times with
TBST for 10 min and then incubated with secondary antibody (HRP-labeled
goat anti-mouse IgG, dilution 1:2000, Beyotime Biotechnology). After
washing three times with the TBST for 10 min, protein bands were visualized
with the BeyoECL Plus kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). GAPDH was used
as a loading control.

4.7 Statistical Analysis
All experimental
permutations were duplicated, and independent experiments were repeated
at least in triplicate. The data are presented as the mean ±
standard error of three independent experiments. Student’s t-test was used to calculate the statistical significance.
The asterisks * denote p values of less than 0.05
