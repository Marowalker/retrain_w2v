A new
dansyl-based chemosensor (2-(4-((5-(dimethylamino)naphthalen-1-yl)sulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N-(quinolin-8-yl)acetamide) (DC) for detecting
Cu2+ was synthesized and characterized. DC showed great selectivity to Cu2+ by a fluorescent “on–off”
detection method. Job plot, ESI-mass spectroscopy, and 1H NMR titration suggested a 1 to 1 binding mode between DC and Cu2+. The detection limit was determined to be 43
nM, which is greatly below the WHO guidelines. In addition, DC can be applied to real samples and zebrafish imaging. The
fluorescence quenching mechanism was proposed as the enhancement of
intramolecular charge transfer with calculations.

1 Introduction
Copper
is a well-known conducting material and thus, used in many
industrial fields such as electrical equipment, tube, pipe, and other
machines.1 In addition, as the third richest
transition metal in the body, it is involved in many pivotal functions.2,3 For instance, several enzymes and proteins such as cytochrome c oxidase and metallothionein use copper as a cofactor and
depend on it for their activity.4,5 Because of its various
roles, deficiency or an overload of copper could cause health problems
such as liver cirrhosis and damage to the brain and other organs.6,7 Because human beings could be affected by the amount of copper in
the environment, the detection of copper has attracted considerable
attention.8,9

Several detection methods for sensing
copper ions have been developed
so far. For instance, inductively coupled plasma, atomic absorption
spectroscopy, and other electrochemical tools have been used. However,
they need sample pretreatment and expensive equipment, and the samples
could be destroyed during the analysis process.10−12 Moreover, the
methods could not apply to living organisms for bioimaging.13,14 On the contrary, chemosensors have received much attention because
it could overcome those defects.15−17 It is easy-to-handle,
cheap, and sensitive.18,19 Especially, chemosensors using
fluorescence could be applied for real-time bioimaging of various
analytes.

Many chemosensors with a variety of chromophores and
fluorophores
have been used to detect Cu2+, such as BODIPY,20,21 rhodamine,19,22 coumarin,15,23 benzimidazole,24−26 and naphthalimide.27,28 The dansyl
moiety is also used as a fluorophore of chemosensors for sensing various
metal ions including Cu2+ because of its high quantum yield.6,29−37 However, its low solubility in water is a huge obstacle for in vivo
imaging. Hence, we envisioned the use of piperazine as a linker to
combine the dansyl group and the quinoline moiety because quinoline
derivatives show good water solubility with useful chromophore properties.38 That is, the chemosensor having both dansyl
and quinoline moieties might show high selectivity to Cu2+ with good solubility in water.

Herein, we presented a novel
dansyl- and quinoline-based chemosensor
(2-(4-((5-(dimethylamino)naphthalen-1-yl)sulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N-(quinolin-8-yl)acetamide) (DC) for detecting
Cu2+ by a fluorescence “on–off” mode. DC showed a successful zebrafish imaging with good water solubility.
Based on diverse spectroscopic studies and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, we demonstrated the detection mechanism of DC for Cu2+.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Fluorescent Turn-Off Detection
of Cu(II) Ions
DC was obtained by the substitution
reaction of N,N-dimethyl-5-(piperazin-1-ylsulfonyl)naphthalen-1-amine
(DP) and 2-chloro-N-(quinolin-8-yl)acetamide
(CQA) in dichloromethane (DCM, 58%, Scheme 1). It was characterized through 1H and 13C NMR and ESI-MS (Figures S1 and S2). The stability of DC was tested in
bis-tris buffer (pH 7.0; Figure S3), which
indicated that its fluorescence intensity at 496 nm was stable enough
for 1 h. The fluorescence selectivity test of DC to diverse
cations was executed in bis-tris buffer. As shown in Figure 1, DC itself and DC with other metal ions showed strong fluorescence emissions
at 496 nm, while the fluorescence was completely quenched with Cu2+ within 15 min. It indicated that DC may be
used as a selective probe for detecting Cu(II) ions via a fluorescence
“on–off” mode. The quantum yields (Φ) of DC and DC–Cu2+ turned to be
0.033 and 0.0035, respectively, with quinine as a standard fluorophore.

spectra of DC (4 μM) with diverse
cations.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedure of DC
For studying the binding properties,
fluorescence titration of DC towards Cu2+ ions
was conducted (Figure 2). On addition of Cu2+ to DC, the fluorescence
emission of 496 nm was persistently
decreased up to 16 equiv of Cu2+. UV–vis titration
of DC with copper ions showing two defined isosbestic
points at 277 and 304 nm (Figure S4), implying
that the only a species was given from the reaction of DC and copper ions.

Figure 2 Fluorescent titration of DC (4 μM)
with the
addition of Cu2+. Inset: Fluorescent emission at 496 nm
vs the amount of Cu2+.

The job plot experiment was conducted for studying binding
stoichiometry
(Figure 3). The largest
intensity difference (I0 – I) between DC and DC–Cu2+ complexes was shown at 0.5 of the mole fractions, indicating
that DC and Cu2+ binds with a 1 to 1 ratio.
The result of positive ESI-mass analysis also supported the 1 to 1
binding ratio (Figure 4). The peak of m/z 565.30 could
be assigned to [DC + Cu2+ – H+]+ (m/z 565.12). Moreover, 1H NMR titration was conducted to further apprehend the binding
mechanism of DC–Cu2+ (Figure S5). On the addition of Cu2+ (0.5 equiv),
the proton H11 disappeared and the protons H8, H9, and H10 shifted down or upfield. Further
addition of Cu2+ ions caused most peaks to be broadened
because of its paramagnetic property.53 These results suggested that the three N atoms of DC may coordinate to Cu2+. With the results of Job plot,
ESI-MS, and 1H NMR titration, we proposed a possible binding
mode of DC–Cu2+ (Scheme 2). On the basis of the 1 to 1 binding ratio,
the association constant of DC and Cu2+ calculated
was 2.2 × 104 M–1 (Figure S6).54

stoichiometry of DC (4 μM)

Scheme 2 Proposed Binding Structure of DC–Cu2+
For practical applications, the competition experiment
with other
metal ions was conducted (Figure 5). Compared to the DC–Cu2+ complex, other coexisting metal ions did not interfere with fluorescence
emission change. Therefore, this result implied that DC could effectively detect copper ions in the presence of several
cations. The detecting ability of DC towards copper ions
was tested in various pH ranges (Figure S7). DC showed a prominent fluorescence emission in the
pH scope from 6 to 9, while the DC–Cu2+ complex showed a complete fluorescence quenching in the same pH
range (Figure S7a). It was well matched
with the photographs of DC itself and DC with Cu2+ (Figure S7b). This
observation demonstrated that DC could be used for sensing
copper ions in the pH scope from 6 to 9. In addition, DC was applied to detect copper ions in tap, drinking, and artificially
polluted water samples. The calibration curve was used to determine
the amount of copper ions in real samples (Figure 6). As displayed in Table 1, plausible recoveries and relative standard
deviations (RSD) were obtained from three types of water samples.
The results suggested that DC could be used for quantifying
Cu(II) ions in real samples. The detection limit from the calibration
curve was 43 nM, which is far lower than the WHO recommendation (31.5
μM).55

8 μM of Al3+, K+, Pb2+, Na+, and Ca2+ were added, respectively.

To investigate the sensing ability
of DC in live organisms,
fluorescent imaging for zebrafish was performed (Figure 7). Zebrafish treated with DC (1 μM) for 15 min showed an obvious fluorescence
signal (Figure 7a2). On addition of 5 μM of Cu(II) ions, the fluorescence
emission in the zebrafish tail started to decrease (Figure 7b2). As the amount
of copper ions increased to 20 μM, the fluorescence emissions
gradually decreased and become nearly invisible (Figure 7c2,d2). Therefore, these results indicated that organism-permeable probe DC could monitor Cu2+ in living organisms. The
mean emission of these images was given with Icy software (Figure S8). The calculated detection limit was
4.37 μM, which is still below the WHO standard. Importantly,
this is the first report of the detection limit obtained in zebrafish
imaging tests with Cu2+ chemosensors (Table S1).56−59

(a1–a3) Zebrafish were incubated with DC (1 μM) for 15 min; (b1–b3) subsequent treatment with Cu2+ (5 μM); (c1–c3) subsequent treatment with Cu2+ (10 μM); (d1–d3) subsequent treatment
with Cu2+ (20 μM). Scale bar: 1 mm.

2.2 DFT/Time-Dependent DFT
Calculations
The 1:1 stoichiometry for DC–Cu2+ was
applied for calculations, based on ESI-mass and Job plot analyses.
In Figure 8 energy-minimized
forms of DC and DC–Cu2+ are displayed. Imaginary frequencies were not observed in both structures,
indicating that they were at the local minima. The three N atoms in
the quinoline and piperazine moieties of DC coordinated
to Cu2+. As Cu2+ bound to DC, the
dansyl moiety was more rotated and the dihedral angle was significantly
changed (1N, 2N, 3N, and 4N = −37.66°). We calculated
the possible transitions of DC and DC–Cu2+ complexes using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), which is based
on energy-optimized structures (Figures S9–S11). The major transition of DC was observed at 336.74
nm and its molecular orbital change represented π → π*
transition in the quinoline moiety (Figures S9 and S11). The addition of Cu2+ induced the changes
of the transition character of DC. The main transition
was observed at 316.81 nm and its molecular orbitals showed intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) (Figures S10 and S11). The calculated blue shifted transition (336.74 nm → 316.81
nm) was well matched with the experimental UV–vis spectra.
The orbital changes occurred from the dimethylamino group to the sulfonyl
one. In addition, the oscillator strength was increased (0.1156 →
0.2081). Therefore, the binding of Cu2+ to DC-enhanced ICT and this nonradiative transition would cause fluorescence
quenching. Moreover, the paramagnetic effect of Cu2+ would
affect fluorescence quenching. The electron configuration (d9) of Cu2+ made intersystem crossing become faster. Then,
the excitation energy was consumed in nonradiative transition and
fluorescence was quenched. Based on the Job plot, ESI-MS, and theoretical
calculations, we proposed the possible binding form of DC–Cu2+ and the sensing mechanism of copper ions
by DC (Scheme 2).

3 Conclusions
We presented a unique dansyl-
and quinoline-based chemosensor DC for sensing copper
ions by a fluorescence “on–off”
method. In order to increase solubility in water and selectivity to
Cu2+, we combined a dansyl chloride and a quinoline moiety
with piperazine as the linker. As we expected, DC displayed
great selectivity and sensitivity towards copper ions with a low detection
limit (43 nM) in aqueous solution. With the Job plot, ESI-MS, 1H NMR titration, and DFT calculations, we demonstrated the
appropriate binding structure and detecting mechanism for Cu2+ by DC. Moreover, DC could be applied to
the real water samples and zebrafish imaging. Importantly, we reported,
for the first time, the detection limit of Cu2+ in zebrafish
imaging tests. We believed that sensor DC could be used
as a competent tool for sensing Cu(II) ions by a fluorescence “on–off”
method in aqueous solution and living organisms.

Both 1H NMR and 13C NMR were recorded on a Varian spectrometer (400 and 100
MHz). The fluorescence and absorption spectra were gained with PerkinElmer
spectrometers (LS45 for fluorescence and Lambda 2S for UV–visible).
ESI-MS were recorded by using Waters (Milford, MA, USA) Acquity SQD
quadrupole Mass instrument. Chemicals were provided from Sigma-Aldrich. CQA and DP were synthesized according to the
literature.39,40

4.2 Synthesis

Thirty
milliliters of DCM was chosen to dissolve DP (8.0 mmol,
2.56 g) and CQA (8.0 mmol, 1.76 g). Triethylamine was
added to the reaction solution, which was shaken for 4 d at 20 °C.

4.3 General Procedures for
Fluorescent Applications
A concentrated solution (0.01 M)
of DC was made in
dimethylsulfoxide. DC was diluted to bis-tris buffer
(pH 7.0, 0.01 M). For concentrated solutions of metal ions, nitrate
salts were used, and perchlorate salt for Fe2+. All metal
salts (In3+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Fe3+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Ga3+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Fe2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, K+) were dissolved
in DMF for concentrated solutions (0.01 M).

4.4 Quantum
Yields of DC and DC–Cu2+
By using quinine (ΦF = 0.54 in 0.1 M of
H2SO4) as a standard
fluorophore,41 we calculated the quantum
yield (Φ). The equation is in this way42  where the meaning of each
abbreviation is
ΦF: fluorescent quantum yield, A: absorbance, F: area of fluorescent emission curve, n: refractive index of solvent, S: standard, and X: unknown.

4.5 Zebrafish Imaging
Living zebrafish
embryos were cultured at 28 °C and kept under proper breeding
conditions on a 10 h dark/12 h light cycle. For the fluorescent imaging,
6 day-old zebrafish were treated with E2 media (pH 7.1; 5 × 10–4 g/L methylene blue, 7 × 10–4 M sodium carbonate, 0.5 mM potassium chloride, 15 mM sodium chloride,
5 × 10–5 M Na2HPO4, 10–4 M magnesium sulfate, 1.5 × 10–4 M KH2PO4, and 1.0 mM calcium chloride) containing DC (1 μM) for 15 min. In the Cu2+ detection
study, living zebrafish embryos were stained with Cu2+ (0,
5, 10, and 20 μM) for 14 min after washing with E2 media. All
the fish were terminally anesthetized using 0.01% MS222 (ethyl-3-aminobenzoate
methanesulfonate) after rinsing with E2 media to discard the surplus
sensor DC and Cu2+. Fluorescence images were
carried out on a MDG36 (Leica). The Icy software was used to determine
the mean intensity of the images.

4.6 Theoretical
Calculations
We obtained
theoretical calculation results using the Gaussian 09W program.43 Before calculating electronic states of DC and DC–Cu2+ complexes, geometry
optimizations were conducted using the DFT method.44,45 The hybrid functional was CAM-B3LYP, and the basis set was 6-31G(d,p).
Also, 6-31G(d,p) was applied to all atoms except Cu2+.46,47 The LANL2DZ basis set was employed for applying effective core potential
to Cu2+.48−50 In the frequency calculations, imaginary frequencies
were not observed, indicating that the structures presented local
minima. The solvent effect of water was regarded with CPCM.51,52 Based on energy-optimized structures of DC and DC–Cu2+, the UV–visible transition
examination was demonstrated with TD-DFT method with the thirty lowest
singlet states.
