Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)
gene variants. Previous research has identified some PAH mutation hotspots in Chinese patients with PKU. In this study, we
introduce a novel MassArray panel for screening the 29 common PAH gene mutations in Chinese patients using iPLEX MALDI-TOF
MS. 105 Patients with PKU and known PAH gene mutations
were genotyped using this MassArray panel. All of the 29 mutations
screened were detected, and MassArray panel results were consistent
with those obtained by Sanger sequencing. Fifty patients newly diagnosed
with PKU were recruited in the double-blind experiment. PAH gene variants were detected in these 50 patients using the MassArray
panel, and the results were verified with Sanger sequencing and Multiplex
Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) methods. Our results
show that the mutation detection rate using the MassArray panel with
29 mutations is 74% (95% CI, 65–83%), and the clinical genetic
diagnosis rate is 54% (95% CI, 40–68%). This panel can be used
as a high throughput, low cost, and rapid method for screening and
diagnosing PAH gene mutations. The establishment
of this approach provides proof-of-concept for future large-scale PAH mutation carrier screening in areas with high rates
of PKU.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Phenylketonuria
(PKU) is one of the most common autosomal recessive
metabolic diseases. Phenylalanine (Phe) metabolic disorders in the
liver can be caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene variants. The incidence of PKU varies among ethnic
and geographic regions, and PKU affects approximately 1 in 15 000
newborns.1 In mainland China, the average
incidence of PKU is 1 in 11 6142.2 However, the newborn screening program indicates that the incidence
of PKU level in Gansu, in the northwest region of China, is 1 in 3420.3

More than 1000 PAH mutations
have been identified
and recorded in the locus-specific database, PAHvdb (http://www.biopku.org/pah/). The frequencies and distributions of PAH mutations
also differ among different populations.4 Previous research has identified some PAH mutational
hotspots in patients with PKU.5 The higher
prevalence of PKU in northwest China may result from a higher frequency
of PAH gene mutations. Therefore, it is important
to characterize PAH gene mutations in PKU to provide
a complete molecular diagnosis, which will contribute to improved
disease management. This information will also benefit the screening
of at-risk populations and prenatal diagnosis.

The detection
of PAH mutations mainly depends
on Sanger and next-generation sequencing. These approaches are expensive
and time-consuming and are not feasible for screening PAH gene mutations in regions with high rates of PKU. This indicates
the need for new ways to detect common PAH mutations.
Recently, several high-throughput technologies, such as Denaturing
high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC),6 high resolution melting (HRM),7 SNaPshot,8 and amplification-refractory
mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR)9 analysis, have been developed. One such promising technology
called iPLEX MALDI-TOF MS, which is based on matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
and provided by Sequenom Inc. (San Diego, CA), is also known as MassArray
technology. iPLEX MALDI-TOF MS provides rapid measurement of DNA products,
with modest multiplexing and minimal assay setup costs owing to the
use of unmodified oligonucleotide primers.10 We developed a panel for screening the 29 PAH gene
mutations common in Chinese patients using iPLEX MALDI-TOF MS. The
power of this panel in detecting PAH mutations was
demonstrated by applying it to 50 patients with newly diagnosed PKU.

2 Results
2.1 Design and Establishment
of the MassArray
Assay
The MassArray assay was developed to detect 29 of 35
selected PAH mutations in two reactions, W1 and W2,
and all of PCR and SBE Primers for the 29 mutations are shown in Table S1. The remaining six mutations (c.208_210del,
c.694C > T, c.739G > C, c.740G > T, c.482T > C, and c.1252A
> C) were
excluded from the assay because of their low frequencies and interference
of the primers used to detect the mutations with other primers in
the multiplex reaction. Reaction W1 covered 21 mutations, and reaction
W2 covered 13 mutations. Five common mutations were detected in both
reactions (c.611A > G, c.1199G > A, c.782G > A, c.764T >
C, c.1174T
> A) (Table 1).
The
molecular weights of all designed and synthesized single-base extended
primers, as assessed by mass spectrometry, were consistent with their
calculated molecular weights. The preliminary genotyping results were
compared with those previously obtained by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1 shows the 10 most
common mutations).

2.2 Clinical Study
The MassArray assay
successfully screened 105 patients (with known PAH genotypes) for 29 PAH mutations. Each of the 29
mutations was detected in at least one of the 105 patients screened.
The assay was unable to detect mutations in five of the patients.
Examination of their corresponding Sanger sequencing results revealed
that the mutations present in these patients were not included in
the 29 mutations of the assay. MassArray assay results for one patient
identified that the patient was homozygous for c.728G > A (using
Typer
software), while Sanger sequencing showed a compound heterozygous
genotype c.728G > A and c.739G > C. A manual check of the original
mass spectrometry peak revealed a mini peak in the G position of the
c.728G > A mutation (Figure 2).

Sanger sequencing and multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MLPA) detection methods detected 98 mutant alleles in 50 newly diagnosed
patients recruited in this study, a detection rate of 98% (95% CI:
95.26–100%). The MassArray method detected 74 mutant alleles
in 50 patients with a detection rate of 74% (95% CI: 65–83%)
(Table 2). All 24 alleles
that were detected by Sanger sequencing and MLPA but not detected
by MassArray assay were not one of the 29 mutations included in the
MassArray assay. The coincidence rate of the detection results using
the MassArray assay and using Sanger sequencing and MLPA for the 29
assay mutations was 100%. Homozygous mutations were detected in seven
patients using the MassArray, complex heterozygous mutations were
detected in 20 patients, a single pathogenic mutation was detected
in 20 patients, and no mutation was detected in three patients. Using
the MassArray assay, the PKU diagnostic rate reached 54% (95% CI:
40–68%).

3 Discussion
PAH gene mutations that
cause PKU are diverse
and differ between ethnic groups and geographical locations. Comparison
of PAH mutational data of different ethnic groups
has revealed correlations between the specific mutations and the genetic
histories of the investigated populations. Marked differences were
identified when comparing PAH mutations of Asian
and European populations. The most common mutations are p.R408W and
IVS12 + 1G > A in Eastern and Northern Europe, respectively.4 However, these mutations are rarely detected
in Asian populations. Five mutations, p.R243Q, p.EX6-96A > G, p.R241C,
p.R413P, and IVS4-1G > A, are common in East Asian countries such
as China, Japan, and Korea, where they account for 53.76, 69.70, and
62.10% of the total mutations, respectively.13 In the present study, 35 mutations that we previously identified,
with frequencies greater than 1%, were selected for MassArray assay
design. Finally, 29 mutations were included in the assay, accounting
for 66.5–72.6% of Chinese patients with PKU as previously reported5,14,15 (Table 3). The detection rate of 74% in our clinical
study by the MassArray assay with 29 mutations was similar to previous
reports, but was lower than the results obtained using Sanger sequencing
combined with MLPA. However, considering the high frequency of these
mutations, the MassArray assay could be performed as a first-pass,
low cost, and straightforward approach for mutation detection in patients
with PKU and for mutation screening in at-risk populations.

The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry methodology enables
rapid and accurate
large-scale mutation screening in high throughput and an automated
manner.16 MassArray assays use 384 or 96
chips. Each chip can simultaneously detect up to 384 reactions and
each reaction can detect more than 20 mutations.17 In addition, the MassArray assay requires only two steps
of multiplex PCR amplification and single-base extension (SBE), the
operation process is simple, and it can be completed in one day. The
MassArray method directly detects the mass of the extended primer,
and directly interprets the typing result through the change in mass,
without requiring fluorescence labeling. This avoids the fluorescence
labeling quality influencing the result. The single-base extension
primers do not require expensive fluorescent labeling, and special
probes and primers are not prefabricated on the chip. Because the
chip for mass spectrometry detection is universal, different detection
methods can be directly adjusted by synthesizing different primers
and probes, making this a flexible approach and reducing the reagent
cost.

Despite these advantages, MassArray assays have some drawbacks.
These include the requirement for specific equipment and the cost
of the MassArray instrumentation. Moreover, this approach can only
be used for known mutations, and the detection sites are relatively
limited, so it can only be used as a screening method for high-frequency
mutations. MassArray technology is required to obtain the target DNA
product through the design of multiple PCR primers and multiple single-base
extension primers. In this study, PAH gene mutations
were relatively concentrated on several hotspot mutant exons. On exon
7, for example, there are at least 25 known mutations within a 20-bp
range including c.721C > T, c.722delG, c.724C > T, c.727C >
T, c.728G
> A, c.739G > C, and c.740G > T.11 This
made the design of single-base extension primers problematic and led
to us abandoning further investigation of some low-frequency sites
in the region. Moreover, if variants around the detection site affect
the combination of single-base extended primer and template DNA, the
results will be inaccurate. In this research, a compound heterozygous
sample with c.728G > A/c.739G > C mutation was analyzed during
verification
of the detection system, and the c.739G > C mutation affected the
analysis of c.728G > A. Similar situations could lead to false
results.

MassArray technology is a method of microsequencing.
It can only
perform fixed-point detection for known mutations, which are relatively
limited. In this study, 50 patients with an initial PKU diagnosis
were screened for 29 hotspot PAH mutations. The mutation
detection rate reached 74% (95% CI: 65–83%), and 54% (95% CI:
40–68%) of cases could be diagnosed using this approach. Using
MassArray technology, the detection and diagnosis rates are higher
than those obtained with other known mutation screening technologies.

Sanger sequencing is still the gold standard for identifying gene
mutations owing to its high detection rate and accuracy. With the
development of next-generation sequencing technology, scholars will
apply multiple sequencing platforms to detect PAH mutations and variants of multiple key genes in phenylalanine metabolism,
and the detection rate may reach 100%.18−20 Although second-generation
sequencing technology has the advantages of high mutation detection
rate and high throughput, it requires complex library construction
and sequencing processes, the sequencing cycle is long, and data analysis
is complex. These disadvantages limit its scope for clinical application.

In this study, a PAH gene hotspot mutation detection
MassArray-based method was established. This method could simultaneously
genotype 29 PAH gene hotspot variants with a detection
rate of 74% (95% CI: 65–83%). MassArray technology is simple
to operate, has high accuracy and specificity, and can be used as
a high throughput, low cost, and rapid screening and diagnosis method
for PAH gene mutations. The establishment of this
scheme also provides a technical basis for large-scale PAH hotspot mutation carrier screening in PKU high-incidence areas in
the future.

4 Experimental Section
The study was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Gansu
Provincial Maternity and Child-Care Hospital and followed the approved
ethical standards of the declaration of Helsinki. Moreover, written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects or from their guardians.

4.1 Patient Recruitment and Sample Preparation
We included
155 unrelated patients with PKU in this study. Of these,
105 had been recruited and genotyped in our previous research.11 Fifty patients with PKU diagnosed from 2016
to 2017 but with unknown genotypes were also included. Blood samples
were collected for genetic testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from
the leukocytes present in 2–3 mL of peripheral blood using
Whole Blood Genomic DNA Extraction Kits (Tiangen, Beijing, China).
The purity and concentration of the samples were determined using
a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and the samples
were stored at −80 °C until required for analysis.

4.2 Design of MassArray Assay
Thirty-five
common PAH gene mutations, reported previously by
us and other researchers in China,5,11 were selected
for the MassArray assay design. Our mutation-selection criteria are
based on our previous research data, the minimum frequency of each
mutation is greater than 0.33%, each of the mutations is confirmed
in three independent individuals, and finally, 35 mutations are selected.
MassArray Assay Designer software (Sequenom Inc., San Diego) was used
to design PCR and single-base extension (SBE) primers for all 35 selected
common mutations. The optimal amplicon size was set to 80–120
bp. A 10-mer tag (5′-ACGTTGGATG-3′) was added to the
5′ end of each PCR primer to avoid confusion in the mass spectrum,
and SBE primers were 5′ tailed with nonhomologous sequences
of varying lengths to create large enough mass differences between
the different SBE products to allow detection by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
To avoid interaction among the primers, the software divided the PCR
amplification and SBE primers into multiplex reactions.

4.3 Genotyping by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry
The Sequenom
MassArray iPLEX platform (Sequenom Inc., San Diego)
was used. Silicon chip and DNA amplification products were used for
accurate genotyping by mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was subjected
to iPLEX Gold reactions and the products were transferred to chip
wells. The genotypes were detected in situ using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

iPLEX Gold technology consists of an initial locus-specific PCR
reaction, followed by SBE using mass-modified dideoxy nucleotide terminators
and an oligonucleotide primer which anneals immediately upstream of
the polymorphic site of interest.12 The
products of these reactions are directly applied to a silicon chip.
The mass of the extended primer is determined using MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry. The mass of the primer directly correlates with the
mutation of interest and the mass of added bases indicates the alleles
present at the polymorphic site. Typer software v4.0 (Sequenom Inc.,
San Diego, CA) was used to process the raw data obtained from the
assays.

More than three blank control samples (sterile water)
and negative
control samples are included in each batch of tests to ensure the
controllability of the experimental tests.

4.4 Clinical
Study
To validate the clinical
performance of the MassArray assay, 105 patients with PKU were first
blindly analyzed for common PAH mutations. The genotypes
detected by MassArray assay were then compared with those previously
determined by Sanger sequencing. To evaluate the clinical application
of this genotyping approach, 50 patients with unknown genotypes were
subject to MassArray assay and Sanger sequencing in parallel.

4.5 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed using statistical package for social science
software (SPSS version 22.0). Mutational frequencies and detection
rate were calculated by the counting method.
