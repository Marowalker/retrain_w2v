A zero-dimensional/two-dimensional
heterostructure consists of binary SnO2–ZnO quantum
dots (QDs) deposited on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The so-called SnO2–ZnO
QDs/g-C3N4 hybrid was successfully synthesized
via an in situ co-pyrolysis approach to achieve efficient photoactivity
for the degradation of pollutants and production of hydrogen (H2) under visible-light irradiation. High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy images show the close contacts between SnO2–ZnO QDs with the g-C3N4 in the
ternary SnO2–ZnO QDs/g-C3N4 hybrid. The optimized hybrid shows excellent photocatalytic efficiency,
achieving 99% rhodamine B dye degradation in 60 min under visible-light
irradiation. The enriched charge-carrier separation and transportation
in the SnO2–ZnO QDs/g-C3N4 hybrid was determined based on electrochemical impedance and photocurrent
analyses. This remarkable photoactivity is ascribed to the “smart”
heterostructure, which yields numerous benefits, such as visible-light-driven
fast electron and hole transfer, due to the strong interaction between
the SnO2–ZnO QDs with the g-C3N4 matrix. In addition, the SnO2–ZnO QDs/g-C3N4 hybrid demonstrated a high rate of hydrogen
production (13 673.61 μmol g–1), which
is 1.06 and 2.27 times higher than that of the binary ZnO/g-C3N4 hybrid (12 785.54 μmol g–1) and pristine g-C3N4 photocatalyst (6017.72
μmol g–1). The synergistic effect of increased
visible absorption and diminished recombination results in enhanced
performance of the as-synthesized tin oxide- and zinc oxide-modified
g-C3N4. We conclude that the present ternary
SnO2–ZnO QDs/g-C3N4 hybrid
is a promising electrode material for H2 production and
photoelectrochemical cells.

1 Introduction
The
need to solve the global energy crisis and environmental concerns
has led researchers to work on the development of the hydrogen economy.
Economically feasible strategies for high-yield hydrogen production
remain critically important for the extensive use of hydrogen as an
energy source.1,2 Hydrogen is regarded as a green
energy source and a promising environmentally friendly alternative
to fossil fuels. Various approaches have been proposed for the production
of hydrogen using solar energy. Artificial photosynthesis has attracted
significant research efforts because of its unique potential.

To date, considerable research attention and efforts have focused
on visible-light-active metal-free photocatalysts for the degradation
of organic pollutants and H2 production because of the
increasing need for environmental care and clean energy harvesting.3 Several photocatalysts have been investigated,
including TiO2,4 graphitic carbon
nitride (g-C3N4),5,6 ZnO,7,8 SnO2,9,10 and MoS2.11 Among these, g-C3N4 has
gained prominence as a suitable candidate for both photocatalytic
dye degradation and water splitting because of its well-suited band
gap of ca. 2.7 eV that facilitates superior excitation of charge carriers
by efficient absorption of sunlight. In other words, of the various
two-dimensional (2D) materials studied so far, g-C3N4 is considered to be the most promising candidate given its
low cost, stability, inertness, and, especially, its suitable band
gap energy.12 More significantly, g-C3N4-based nanomaterials are often applied in photocatalyst
applications because they can satisfy the current environmental requirements
of “green” photocatalysts in hybrid heterostructures,
analogue to commercial TiO2-based photocatalysts. However,
g-C3N4 has a low photocatalytic efficiency,
which arises from the recombination of photoinduced electron and hole
pairs.13 Interestingly, the conduction
band (CB) potential of g-C3N4 is more negative
than the reduction potential of H2O/H2, which
is encouraging, suggesting that it can be used to reduce protons to
H2.14 However, the H2 production efficiency in photocatalytic water splitting attained
to date is far lower than that required for practical application.
This is due to the fast recombination of electron–hole pairs
and their susceptibility to photocorrosion in the photocatalysts.15 Therefore, existing photocatalysts must be modified
to improve their activity. Modifications can include loading of co-catalysts,
coupling of two or three materials, and doping with a metal phase.
Among these, one successful approach is the introduction of co-catalysts
onto the surface of photocatalysts.16 A
co-catalyst is usually essential to trap the photogenerated electrons
from the surface of the photocatalyst. However, although this modification
does not entirely diminish electron–hole recombination, it
can moderate the energy required for the surface active reactions.
In most studies, noble metals are usually considered as co-catalyst
candidates.17,18 However, it is essential to develop
noble-metal-free catalysts because of their high cost and scarcity,
which impede their widespread use. Therefore, preparation of photocatalysts
using earth-abundant metals and their compounds is an attractive alternative.

One common strategy is to combine two or three kinds of semiconductor
materials by coupling g-C3N4 with metal oxide
materials, such as SnO2, ZnO, ZnO, or TiO2,19−22 by virtue of their highly efficient photoactivity performance and
remarkable recycling stability. These ternary heterostructured visible-light-driven
photocatalysts have attracted intense interest for their combined
benefits, i.e., high specific surface area and fast photoinduced electron
and hole transfer with favorable interface features. A key point in
the development of heterostructured photocatalysts is the design and
synthesis of photocatalysts with efficient photoactive efficiency
and cycling stability. Recent reports have demonstrated that the combination
of metal oxide nanomaterials with g-C3N4 can
greatly enhance the photocatalytic performance.23,24 For example, Shen et al.24 reported the
integration of SnO2/g-C3N4 crystals
as core–shell structures, which endowed the hybrids with efficient
photocatalytic behaviors for degradation of pollutants. It is widely
known that the specific surface area of g-C3N4 depends on the synthetic conditions. However, a critical challenge
in the synthesis of g-C3N4 is to obtain a-few-layer
to monolayer g-C3N4 with weak van der Waals
forces between the adjacent layers

In this work, we establish
a synthetic procedure for ternary SnO2–ZnO/g-C3N4 heterostructured
hybrids, in which SnO2–ZnO quantum dots (QDs) are
anchored on g-C3N4 nanosheets via a facile in
situ co-pyrolysis approach. This procedure forms an intriguing zero-dimensional
(0D)/2D heterostructure. In this architecture, SnO2/ZnO
QDs were used as spacers between the g-C3N4 layers,
forming a three-dimensional conductive network that facilitates fast
electron and hole transport. In addition, the as-designed heterostructures
also provide a porous structure that may diminish the recombination
of photoinduced electrons and holes and also act as absorbents for
the pollutant molecules on the hybrid surface. The resulting hybrids
exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance under visible-light
irradiation with outstanding cycling stability.

2 Results
and Discussion
The synthetic steps for the resulting hybrids
are illustrated in Figure 1. The typical synthetic
procedure for the synthesis of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid is discussed in Experimental Section. A one-step method was used to produce highly crystalline monodispersed
SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of few-layer
graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sheets. As
illustrated in the first step of Figure 1, the g-C3N4 sheets
have abundant functional groups on their surface. These functional
groups are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the g-C3N4 surface and play a vital role in the formation of the
heterojunction. The g-C3N4 sheets can be easily
separated in ethanol, forming highly dispersed few-layer sheets in
solution because of these functional species. When the solution of
g-C3N4 sheets is mixed with a zinc acetate or
SnCl2 solution, the Zn2+ or Sn2+ ions
selectively bond with functional groups by electrostatic interactions.
Because g-C3N4 is highly dispersed and the Zn2+ or Sn2+ ions are in excess, all of the g-C3N4 sheets are saturated with Zn2+ or
Sn2+ ions. During the co-pyrolysis process in a furnace,
the Zn2+ or Sn2+ ions are spontaneously converted
to ZnO or SnO2 nanoparticles, which are bonded to the surface
of g-C3N4 through the functional groups attached
on the surface of g-C3N4 like −OH or
−COOH.25,26 For instance, Zn(OH)2 reacts with g-C3N4–OH or g-C3N4–COOH and forms Zn–O–g-C3N4 or Zn–O–OC–g-C3N4.

Figure 1 Schematic synthetic procedure for the formation of SZ/g-C3N4 heterostructure.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine g-C3N4, ZnO, Z/g-C3N4, SnO2, and SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid are shown in Figure 2. All of the diffraction
peaks of the pristine samples of g-C3N4, ZnO,
and SnO2 correspond to monoclinic g-C3N4 (JCPDS no. 37-1526),25 hexagonal
wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451),27,28 and rutile
tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445),29 respectively. For pure g-C3N4, the
two distinct XRD peaks at 12.89 and 27.45° correspond to the
(100) and (002) planes of the graphitic carbon nitride. Interestingly,
distinct peaks at 31.77, 34.11, 36.15, 47.46, 56.73, 62.9, and 67.53°,
corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and
(112) crystal planes of ZnO nanoparticles, were observed in the Z/g-C3N4 hybrid. In the case of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid, additional peaks at 25.86, 33.57, and 51.33°
corresponding to the (110), (101), and (211) crystal planes of SnO2 were observed in addition to the Z/g-C3N4 hybrid peaks, which indicates that this is a combined phase of the
g-C3N4, SnO2, and ZnO materials in
the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid and confirms that the SnO2–ZnO/g-C3N4 hybrid had been successfully
synthesized. In addition, no other characteristic impurity peaks were
observed in the XRD patterns.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of pristine g-C3N4, ZnO, Z/g-C3N4, SnO2, and
SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images of pure g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 hybrid are shown in Figure S1. Figure S1a shows only one morphology:
the two-dimensional (2D) layered structure of pristine g-C3N4 that acts as a substrate/platform for the deposition
of foreign materials. Figure S1b–d shows high-magnification TEM images of the Z/g-C3N4 hybrid. The ZnO QDs are randomly distributed on the surface
of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The crystallographic
spacings were determined to be 0.33 and 0.26 nm, which agree well
with the (002) d-spacings of g-C3N4 and ZnO. This result indicates that the ZnO QDs had been
successfully synthesized over the surface of g-C3N4. HRTEM images of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid
are shown in Figure 3. As shown in the high-magnification HRTEM images (Figure 3a–c), there is an obvious
contrast between the SnO2 and ZnO QDs on the top surface
of the g-C3N4 nanosheets, as marked by the yellow
circles, indicating the SnO2 and ZnO materials. In addition,
it is clear that the molar ratio of SnO2 and ZnO affects
the intensity of the QDs on the g-C3N4 nanosheets,
which can be easily varied. As shown in Figure 3c, the interplanar distances of the SnO2 and ZnO QDs were measured to be 0.33 and 0.26 nm, respectively,
which are consistent with the literature for (110) SnO2 and (002) ZnO.30 In addition, the electron
diffraction patterns shown in Figure 3d, which were recorded at positions randomly chosen
on the surface of hybrid, has a polycrystalline nature. In detail,
the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid displays two types of diffraction features:
one set of isolated dots originating from the g-C3N4 sheets and another set from SnO2–ZnO nanocrystals.
This is clear evidence for the formation of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid structure. Figure 4a–f reveals the even distribution
of the C, N, Sn, Zn, and O elements and verifies the successful preparation
of the SZ/g-C3N4 composite. The constituents
of SnO2 and ZnO on g-C3N4 are C,
N, Sn, Zn, and O, as shown in Figure 4g. In addition, HRTEM-energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
also confirmed the formation of SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles
on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets.

In addition, the morphology, elemental mapping, and EDX analysis
of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid were carried out using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure S2. Similar to the morphology observed in the HRTEM
images, tiny SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles can be seen randomly
distributed on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets
(Figure S2a). Figure S2b–f reveals the existence of C, N, Sn, Zn, and O distributed
randomly over the entire architecture. The SEM and HRTEM elemental
mapping and EDX results clearly show that the 0D/2D SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles/g-C3N4 nanosheets
hybrid had been successfully synthesized. Figure S3 presents SEM-EDX spectra of pristine g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts. The table provided in the inset gives the surface
composition of C, N, O, Zn, and Sn elements. The wt % values of Sn
and Zn on the surface of SZ/g-C3N4 composite
were observed to be 3.79 and 14.79, respectively. In addition to the
EDX analysis by SEM, the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis (Figure S4) of the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite is performed
to find the bulk composition of Sn and Zn. The results show the wt
% values of Sn and Zn in the ternary SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite to be 1.99 and 26.56, respectively. Interestingly,
the bulk composition of the Sn and Zn elements observed by the ICP-OES
is lower than the surface composition of the Sn and Zn elements experimented
by the SEM-EDX. This clarifies that the Sn and Zn elements are present
more on the surface rather to the bulk. This attributes that the SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles are highly dispersed over the surface
of g-C3N4 sheets.

The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of pure g-C3N4 and the
Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 hybrids are shown in Figure 5. For the pure g-C3N4 sample, broad
peaks at 3088, 1603, 1405, 1317, and 1238 cm–1 are
attributed to the stretching vibrations of N–H and O–H
bonds, stretching vibrations of aromatic C–N heterocycles composed
of trigonal N–C3 and C–NH–C bridging
units, and the formation of C–N–C bonds, respectively.31 The peaks from 580 to 1100 cm–1 could be ascribed to the breathing mode of the tri-s-triazine ring.31 In the case of the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid samples,
similar absorption bands were observed, including the main characteristic
peaks of pure g-C3N4. The peaks in the range
of 1200–1410 cm–1 are assigned to the C–N
and C=N stretching vibration modes obtained from the characteristic
peaks of g-C3N4. For the nanocomposites, the
broad absorption band at 2900–3700 cm–1 is
attributed to the terminal NH2 or NH groups at the defect
sites of the g-C3N4 aromatic rings.31−34 The characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 are present
in both Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites.

The active sites and
high surface area of the photocatalysts have
a significant effect on the photocatalytic activities. The specific
surface areas of all photocatalysts were measured using the nitrogen
adsorption–desorption curves. Figure 6 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution of g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 hybrids. The SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
has a higher specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area of 46.38 m2 g–1 and pore volume
of 0.234 cm3 g–1 than those of pristine
g-C3N4 (24.7 m2 g–1 and 0.098 cm3 g–1, respectively) and
Z/g-C3N4 (34.65 m2 g–1 and 0.181 cm3 g–1, respectively). A
distinct hysteresis loop for the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
is present, which is typical of mesoporous materials. This structure
is favorable for the photodegradation of pollutants and is not present
in pristine g-C3N4. The surface areas of the
materials increased in the following order: pristine g-C3N4 < Z/g-C3N4 < SZ/g-C3N4. Commonly, the surface area of the nanocomposite
is higher than that of the components, as reported for several composite
photocatalysts.30,31,35 For instance, in our previous work,25 we constructed novel MoS2/Al2O3/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts and reported
BET surface areas of 24.2 m2 g–1 for
g-C3N4 and 101.5 m2 g–1 for MoS2/Al2O3/g-C3N4.

pore size distribution data of pristine g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts.

To further confirm the
elemental compositions of the obtained samples,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns of the prepared samples
were obtained, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a shows the survey XPS image of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid; it indicates that SZ/g-C3N4 contains
C, N, O, Sn, and Zn. Figure 7b shows the XPS image of Sn 3d for the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid. The peaks at binding energies of 487.31 and 495.76
eV correspond to Sn2+ and Sn4+, respectively.36 The XPS analyses indicate that both Sn2+ and Sn4+ species exist in the composite. Figure 7c shows the observed peaks,
which can be assigned to ZnO (Zn) at 1020.98 and 1045.54 eV for Zn
2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and is consistent
with the literature.7 From Figure 7d, there are three main distinctive
peaks of the C 1s core level of g-C3N4 at 284.32,
285.88, and 287.87 eV, which were assigned to the sp2 C–C
bonds of graphitic carbon, sp3-coordinated carbon bonds,
and sp2-bonded carbon (N–C=N) in the tri-s-triazine rings, respectively.25Figure 7e shows the
N 1s peaks at 398.36 and 400.49 eV, which can be ascribed to sp2-bonded N (C–N=C) and amino groups (C–N–H)
of g-C3N4, respectively.25Figure 7f shows the O 1s spectrum of the SZ/g-C3N4 hybrid.
The peak at 530.75 eV is ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the normal
metal oxide crystal structure, and the high energy peak at 532 eV
is attributed to surface-adsorbed hydroxy groups. Further, the XPS
images confirm that the 0D SnO2–ZnO-nanoparticle-loaded
2D g-C3N4 nanosheets and the formed 0D/2D SZ/g-C3N4 heterojunctions exhibited improved stability
and photocatalytic activity.

Sn, (c) Zn, (d) C,
(e) N, and (f) O of the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst.

The UV–vis absorption spectra
of the g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts are shown in Figure 8. They show that
the deposition of ZnO and SnO2 on the g-C3N4 resulted a strong absorption
band around 400–500 nm, which matches well with the visible
part of the solar spectrum. Using the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
diffuse reflection spectrum (DRS), the band gaps of all samples were
estimated according to the equation Eg = 1240/λ, where Eg is the band
gap energy and λ is the absorption wavelength.37 The absorption onsets were observed at approximately 459,
455, and 450 nm for the g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 photocatalysts,
respectively. The SZ/g-C3N4 had better photoresponse
and absorption intensity than g-C3N4 and Z/g-C3N4 samples. By the introduction of ZnO and SnO2 into g-C3N4, a slight blue shift in
the absorption edge was observed compared to the pristine g-C3N4 owing to the increased variation in the optical
absorption of the nanocomposite. The increase in optical absorption
results from quantum confinement, and this is the reason for the blue
shift in the composite samples, which is consistent with the XRD results.
Moreover, the ZnO and SnO2 nanoparticles dispersed over
the surface of the g-C3N4 inhibit the agglomeration
of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The optical properties
of the exfoliated nanosheets of the g-C3N4 are
different from those of the bulk g-C3N4 sheets.
Hence, these combined effects enhance the absorption of low-energy
photons and, consequently, increase the number of photoexcited charges.

2.1 Photocatalytic Degradation
of Rhodamine B
(RhB) Dye
The photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites
were estimated using RhB dye degradation in aqueous solutions. The
time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra of RhB dye degradation
over g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites are shown in Figure S5. Figure S5a–c shows the variation in the RhB absorption with irradiation time
over different photocatalysts. The decrease in the intensity of the
absorption spectra of RhB dye (λmax = 553 nm) at
different intervals of irradiation time over g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was observed in detail. The reduction
in the peak intensities is an evidence of the photodegradation of
RhB in the presence of the photocatalysts (Figure S5a–c). The complete degradation of the RhB dye under
visible-light irradiation in the presence of g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 was achieved after 130, 100, and 60 min irradiation, respectively.
Unsurprisingly, the ternary nanocomposite (SZ/g-C3N4) demonstrated better performance than both g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. Figure 9 shows the comparison
of the photocatalytic performances of different photocatalysts. Photodegradation
depends on (i) the adsorption of the dye by the photocatalyst, (ii)
the presence of fast charge-carrier exchange pathways, and (iii) a
large number of highly active surface sites. In this study, g-C3N4 acts as an adsorption support material and dye
is adsorbed on the surface of the 2D nanosheets. The ability of g-C3N4 as a good adsorbent for organic compounds is
because of the favorable interactions between the dye molecules and
the aromatic structure of g-C3N4.38 Also, the extended delocalization of π
electrons in g-C3N4 allows the charge carriers
to have a high mobility. However, the bare g-C3N4 demonstrated lower photocatalytic activity because of the recombination
of charge carriers. Z/g-C3N4 shows better performance
than pristine g-C3N4 owing to the contribution
of ZnO quantum-sized nanoparticles, which reduces the charge-carrier
recombination in g-C3N4. The SZ/g-C3N4 ternary nanocomposite demonstrated excellent performance
compared to g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. The quantum-sized SnO2 and
hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanoparticles actively contribute to significantly
improved photocatalytic activity. The SZ/g-C3N4 ternary nanocomposite showed greatly improved photocatalytic activity
because of the improved light absorption and transfer of photoinduced
charge carriers arising from the combination of the benzene aromatic
structure of g-C3N4 with the SnO2 and ZnO QDs. Recently, Dong et al. have reported that g-C3N4 shows extraordinary performance as a photocathode for
photoelectrochemical hydrogen production39 and degradation of heavy metals40 under
visible-light irradiation. This is an additional advantage because
organic species are trapped on the high surface area of the nanosheets;
thus, ZnO and SnO2 in the vicinity can efficiently degrade
the adsorbed RhB dye. The holes and electrons initiate an oxidative
pathway, and, consequently, the adsorbed RhB dye is oxidized. Thus,
photoactive radicals are created during the reaction, which convert
into carbonaceous products, such as CO2 and other intermediates.
The photocatalysis reaction observes pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics
according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model41 as follows 1   2  where k, C0, and C are the pseudo-first-order kinetic
constant and the initial and final concentrations, respectively. The
kinetic plots and apparent rate constants (K, i.e.,
the slope) of the g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites are shown
in Figure 10a–c.
For all degradation experiments, the best fit for the kinetic order
was obtained with the first-order equation. The SZ/g-C3N4 ternary nanocomposite is 5.11 and 2.12 times more efficient
than g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, respectively. The reaction constants for g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were estimated to be 0.0036,
0.0087, and 0.0184 min–1, respectively (Figure 10d). Thus, the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite has higher photocatalytic efficiency
than the other nanocomposites owing to the synergistic effect of the
three components, i.e., g-C3N4, ZnO, and SnO2.

for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB using different photocatalysts.

To understand the effects of ZnO
and SnO2 on the separation
of electron–hole pairs in the g-C3N4 nanosheets,
the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all samples were analyzed. Figure 11 shows the PL spectra
of g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and
SZ/g-C3N4 samples. Pure g-C3N4 has the strongest peak around 442 nm. For the Z/gC3N4 sample, the emission intensity decreased considerably,
signifying that the ZnO-anchored g-C3N4 nanosheet
has lower recombination rate for the photoinduced charge carriers.
However, the SZ/g-C3N4 sample demonstrated the
lowest intensity in its spectrum, signifying much more suppression
for recombination of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs.
Therefore, the result of PL spectra exhibited that an important reason
for the improved photocatalytic activities of Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 is the effective separation
of the electron–hole pairs, owing to the matching of the energy
levels of g-C3N4, ZnO, and SnO2 materials
and similar results reported in the literature.32

Figure 12 presents
a plausible mechanism for RhB degradation using the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. In the ternary SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, the conduction band potential of g-C3N4 (−1.2 eV vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE))
is more negative than the conduction band potentials of ZnO (−0.4
eV vs NHE) and SnO2 (−0.1 eV vs NHE). Hence, the
transfer of photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4 to ZnO and SnO2 is thermodynamically feasible. During
the visible-light irradiation of the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from
the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 to the CB
of SnO2 via the CB of ZnO, whereas the photogenerated holes
transfer to the valence band (VB) of g-C3N4 from
SnO2 via ZnO. Thus, the photogenerated electrons and holes
are separated and the recombination process is inhibited. The photogenerated
electrons are able to react with O2 to create O2•–, and the holes drift to the surface of
the g-C3N4 and react with OH– or H2O to produce •OH radicals, as
shown in eqs 3–7. Thus, produced O2•– and •OH radicals are highly oxidative in nature
and can oxidize the dye molecules to harmless intermediates and finally
mineralizes, as shown in Figure 12. 3   4   5   6   7  To
test the stability and reusability of the
SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, repeated degradation
cycles under visible-light irradiation were carried out for the photocatalytic
degradation of RhB over the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite,
and Figure S6 shows the recycling test
results for the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. There
was a minor reduction over the first two cycles of RhB photodegradation,
but, after two cycles, the degradation behavior stabilized. These
results indicate that the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
has great stability and is an encouraging photocatalyst for use in
the purification of water resources.

photocatalytic degradation
over the SZ/g-C3N4 heterostructure structure
under visible-light irradiation.

To further understand the separation capability of the photogenerated
electron–hole pairs and increased lifetime of the charge carriers,
photocurrent (PC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurements were conducted, as shown in Figure 13. During repeated 60 s on–off irradiation
cycles, prompt and reproducible current responses were recorded for
each electrode. Figure 13a presents the photoresponse switching behavior of the different
photocatalysts, including g-C3N4 and the Z/g-C3N4 and SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposites.
A slight photocurrent response (0.21 μA cm–2) was observed with the g-C3N4 electrode, whereas,
for SZ/g-C3N4, the photocurrent density reached
0.87 μA cm–2, which is about 4.14 times greater
than that of the g-C3N4 electrode. Upon illumination,
the photocurrent rapidly increased (1.4 μA) and then stabilized
at approximately 0.98 μA for the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, drastically decreasing to its initial level when
the light was turned off. Clearly, the photocurrent of the ternary
SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite is improved remarkably,
having a longer life span and more efficient charge separation than
other similar materials.42

studies and (b) EIS spectra of pristine
g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and
SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts.

To demonstrate the advantages of the ternary SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite over the g-C3N4 and Z/g-C3N4 samples, we also prepared Nyquist
plots, which provide powerful evidence to clarify charge-transfer
processes at an electrode interface. These plots are shown in Figure 13b. As shown in
the Nyquist plots, the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
showed the smallest impedance arc radius compared to other samples,
which suggests the presence of a lower charge-transfer resistance
than that of other samples. This should contribute to a better separation
efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improved
photocatalytic efficiency of the ternary SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. In contrast, the high-frequency arc in the Nyquist
plots is related to the reduction in charge transfer, which may be
attributed to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the contact interface between the electrode and electrolyte
solution.

2.2 Photocatalytic H2 Production
Figure 14a shows
hydrogen production from pure water splitting over pristine g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts. The optimum hydrogen production was
achieved for SZ/g-C3N4 (239.29 μmol g–1). The increase in the photocatalytic activity of
SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst is due to the presence of
tin oxide on the SZ/g-C3N4 surface that acts
as a co-catalyst. Xiang et al.43 suggested
the importance of heterostructure-type materials for applications
in energy conversion systems. This unique structure reduces the charge-carrier
transport distance to the surface for redox reactions. Under visible-light
irradiation, the lifetime of the electron–hole pairs is increased
and the charge carriers are efficiently involved in the redox reactions
with adsorbed H+ ions for H2 evolution at the
catalyst surface. The conditions for optimum photocatalytic hydrogen
production over the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst have
been attempted. Figure 14b,c shows the effect of the concentration of glycerol and
catalyst content on the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.
To optimize the glycerol concentration, reactions were carried out
over the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst using glycerol/water
mixtures with various glycerol loadings (Figure 14b). The results show that the glycerol concentration
affects the rate of hydrogen production. The optimal concentration
of glycerol was found to be 5%, which resulted in a photocatalytic
hydrogen production rate of 13 673.61 μmol g–1. In detail, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate increases
with increasing initial glycerol concentration up to 5%. Above 5%
glycerol concentration, there is no increase in H2 production.
This is because, at higher concentrations, saturation of the photocatalyst
surface occurs, and there is no further increase in H2 production.
In addition, the amount of the catalyst in the reaction system also
has a notable effect on the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate
(Figure 14c). The
SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst was added at loadings of
50, 100, 150, and 200 mg L–1 in a 5% glycerol/water
solution. The optimum hydrogen production rate of 13 673.61
μmol g–1 was observed with a catalyst loading
of 100 mg L–1. With increasing catalyst loading,
the hydrogen production increased. However, a higher catalyst loading
is disadvantageous for photocatalytic hydrogen production because
the higher amounts of catalyst make the solution turbid, which inhibits
the absorption of incident light by hindering light transmission.
After several hours, the partial pressure of H2 in the
reactor increased, which resulted in increased H2 solubility
in the solution; thus, the volume of the reactor became insufficient
to accommodate the large amount of H2 generated by the
water-splitting reaction.

Figure 14 (a) H2 generation from pure water
over different catalysts,
(b) effect of the glycerol concentration, and (c) effect of SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst amount on the photocatalytic H2 production under natural and visible-light irradiation (5
h).

The photocatalytic activities
for hydrogen production from a 5%
aqueous glycerol solution as a function of time over different photocatalysts
(i.e., pristine g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and SZ/g-C3N4) are shown in Figure 15a. Among these,
the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibited the highest
activity. The improved rate of H2 production could have
resulted from the favorable properties of the heterostructure-type
SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles, which achieve a higher energy
density because of the higher content of active species on the surface
of g-C3N4. As demonstrated by the EIS results,
the g-C3N4 nanosheets, which are readily dispersed
and form strong interactions with the SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles,
have high electrical conductivity, which leads to a remarkable separation
of the photogenerated charge carriers and enhances the surface shuttling
properties. The photocatalytic activity increases in the order g-C3N4 < Z/g-C3N4 < SZ/g-C3N4. The optimum hydrogen production of 13 673.61
μmol g–1 was observed on SZ/g-C3N4 after 5 h irradiation, and this is about 2.27 times
higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, i.e., 6017.72
μmol g–1, and 1.06 times higher than that
of Z/g-C3N4, i.e., 12 785.54 μmol
g–1. Under visible-light irradiation, charge carriers
are produced in g-C3N4 and are transferred to
the conduction band of ZnO and SnO2. ZnO and SnO2 act as co-catalysts and trap these electrons. Thus, the lifetime
of the electron–hole pairs is increased and the charge carriers
can carry out redox reactions with adsorbed H+ ions for
H2 evolution at the catalyst surface. The factors responsible
for the improved activity are the enhanced optical absorption and
increased lifetime of the charge carriers. The highly dispersed ZnO–SnO2 particles on the surface of g-C3N4 act
as a co-catalyst and contribute to the increased lifetime of the charge
carriers. Hence, the enhanced activity is ascribed to the synergistic
effect of the increased optical absorption and the improved lifetime
of the charge carriers in the system. The improved photocatalytic
activity of g-C3N4 with deposited tin and zinc
oxides compared to pristine g-C3N4 may be ascribed
to the following reasons: (i) surface impurities formed by tin and
zinc oxides increase the visible absorption by decreasing the band
gap of pristine g-C3N4, as shown by UV–vis
DRS measurements44−46 and (ii) increase in the lifetime of the charge carriers.

5 mg in 5 vol % glycerol/water solution. (b) Time-on-stream photocatalytic
H2 production activity over the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst under visible-light irradiation in 5 vol % glycerol/water
solution. (c) Hydrogen evolution rates of SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst under visible- and UV-light irradiation for 5 h
(UV light source: 4 W lamp; wavelength, 254 nm; and light intensity,
340 mW cm–2; visible source, 300 W Xe lamp; light
intensity, 50 mW cm–2). (d) Recyclability of SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst for photocatalytic H2 production
activity under visible-light irradiation in 5 mg in 5 vol % glycerol/water
solution for 5 h.

Figure 15b shows
the time-on-stream activity over the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst. As shown by the data, the activity increases linearly
up to 11 h and then stabilizes. This is because the capacity of the
photoreactor might have become inadequate for further production of
hydrogen after 11 h and some of the formed H2 molecules
might have occupied the active sites on the photocatalyst surface.
The decrease in the rate of hydrogen production with time may also
be due to the pressure developed by the produced hydrogen during the
reaction. Also, the volume of the reactor might become insufficient
to accommodate the further produced hydrogen. Thus, for these reasons,
the production of hydrogen is hindered.

Figure 15c shows
the rate of photocatalytic H2 production over different
catalysts under visible-light and UV-light irradiation. The SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst demonstrated a higher rate of H2 production under UV light irradiation compared to visible-light
irradiation because of the greater absorption capability of the composite.
Additionally, stability tests were performed using three consecutive
photocatalytic activity experiments, where each reaction was performed
for 5 h irradiation with repeated gas evacuation and N2 purging each cycle. Figure 15d shows the results of recycling experiment over pristine
g-C3N4, Z/g-C3N4, and
SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts. Identical amounts of H2 were produced in all five successive experiments. When the
gases were removed, the activity was found to be maintained up to
five cycles. This result indicates that the activity is sustainable
for even longer periods of exposure to visible light. Moreover, to
check the changes in the morphology and crystallinity after the recycling
experiments, HRTEM and XRD measurements of the used SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst were performed after the completion of the
continuous photocatalytic experiments, and the results are shown in Figure S7. The morphology and structural analyses
show that the heterostructure of SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles
anchored on the surface of g-C3N4 was stable
even after five cycles of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

2.3 Structure–Activity Correlation
On the basis
of the analytical results, the impregnation of tin and
zinc oxides on the surface of g-C3N4 resulted
in a fine dispersion of tightly bound SnO2 and ZnO species
over the surface of g-C3N4. The possible photoexcitation
and charge-transfer processes that take place in the SZ/g-C3N4 catalysts are illustrated in Figure 16. In the ternary SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, since the conduction band potential of g-C3N4 (−1.2 eV vs NHE)47 is more negative than the conduction band potentials of ZnO (−0.4
eV vs NHE)48 and SnO2 (−0.1
eV vs NHE),49 the transfer of photogenerated
electrons from g-C3N4 to ZnO and SnO2 is thermodynamically feasible. At the same time, due to the more
positive nature of VB potentials of ZnO and SnO2, the hole
transfer takes place from SnO2 and ZnO to g-C3N4 opposite to the direction of electrons transfer. This
results in the accumulation of electrons and holes on different semiconductor
photocatalysts, which results in the reduction of recombination process.
As the catalyst is exposed to visible light, g-C3N4 absorbs visible light and produces e– and
h+ in the CB and VB, respectively.50 Electrons are then injected into the conduction band of SnO2 via ZnO. To increase the activity, the recombination of e– and h+ should be diminished. The finely
dispersed SnO2 and ZnO species acts as e– receptors and reduce the recombination of charge carriers. The electrons
stored in the conduction band of SnO2 are transferred to
H+ ions and produce H2. Meanwhile, the holes
in the valence band of g-C3N4 are consumed by
the sacrificial agent, which further prevents recombination. Subsequently,
the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is suppressed
and H2 production is boosted.

of a plausible mechanism for photocatalytic
H2 production over SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst
under visible-light irradiation.

2.4 Reason for the Enhanced Catalytic Activity
of the SZ/g-C3N4 Nanocomposite
On the
basis of the reported analytical results, the following factors are
responsible for improving the photocatalytic activity of the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite for the degradation of the anionic
dye RhB and improved H2 production under visible-light
irradiation: (i) In situ synthesized SnO2–ZnO/g-C3N4 demonstrates good interfacial contact strength
that results in a synergistic effect between g-C3N4 and SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles for fast electron
transfer. HRTEM images of SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite
reveal small (ca. 5 nm) SnO2–ZnO nanoparticles randomly
distributed on the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets;
(ii) the band gap narrowing of the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite increased the speed of electron transfer for the degradation
reaction; (iii) the photocurrent and EIS results revealed a high separation
efficiency and diminished electron–hole pair recombination;
and (iv) the high specific surface area and active sites of the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized a new type of SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite photocatalyst via a simple co-pyrolysis
method. The photocatalytic degradation of a model pollutant and H2 production indicate the improved visible-light-driven photocatalytic
performance of the ternary SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite.
The separation ratio of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs
has been greatly enhanced because of the use of ZnO and SnO2 quantum dots that decorate the g-C3N4 nanosheets,
where g-C3N4 acts as an outstanding electron
transporter and support material. The recycling results for the SZ/g-C3N4 catalyst indicate its acceptable photocatalytic
stability. In view of the high photoactivity and recycling stability
of the SZ/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, it has possible
applications in the photocatalytic degradation of other organic pollutants
in wastewater and production of H2.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Thiourea was purchased
from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd. Zinc acetate dihydrate and tin (II)
chloride dihydrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 Photocatalyst
The synthetic procedure for the preparation of g-C3N4 is the same as previously reported.25 In detail, thiourea was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1, yielding a yellow product.
This product was washed with ethanol and dried at 90 °C for 3
h in a muffle furnace.

4.3 Synthesis of ZnO/g-C3N4 and SnO2–ZnO/g-C3N4 Photocatalysts
For the preparation of ZnO/g-C3N4, a certain
amount of thiourea and zinc acetate dihydrate precursors were ground
in an agate mortar and transferred to a ceramic crucible, which was
maintained at 550 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1 to yield ZnO/g-C3N4.
Finally, the precipitates were washed with ethanol and dried at 90
°C for 3 h in a muffle furnace. A similar procedure followed
with the addition of tin precursor to form SnO2–ZnO/g-C3N4. Hereafter, ZnO/g-C3N4 is denoted “Z/g-C3N4” and SnO2–ZnO/g-C3N4 is denoted “SZ/g-C3N4”.

4.4 Characterization
All of the as-prepared
photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu 6100
X-ray diffractometer) using Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies
of the as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and the HRTEM images were
obtained using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin TEM at an accelerating voltage
of 300 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4100) and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to investigate the
composition and structure of the photocatalyst. The infrared (IR)
spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm–1 in
the spectral range 400–4000 cm–1 using 32
scans on an Avatar 370 Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectrometer. UV–vis
spectra of the photocatalysts were obtained on a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR, spectrophotometer). High-resolution
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out
using a Thermo Scientific instrument and Mg Kα X-rays for surface
analysis. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were
analyzed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 surface area analyzer at
liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to gas adsorption, all photocatalysts
were degassed for 2 h at 160 °C. Photocurrent (PC) response measurements
were performed using a Biologic SP-200 electrochemical workstation
with a standard three-electrode cell at room temperature. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using a potentiostat
with a sinusoidal perturbation voltage of 2 mV and the frequency range
of 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz. The Sn and Zn metal contents in the prepared
samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using the Varian 700-ES model.

4.5 Photocatalytic Degradation of the RhB Dye
and H2 Production
The photodegradation of RhB
was performed at room temperature in a photochemical reactor containing
40 mg of photocatalyst and 100 mL of RhB solution. To obtain adsorption–desorption
equilibrium, the photocatalyst was maintained in the dark for 10 min
after adsorption–desorption balance had been achieved. To check
that the photocatalytic activity arose from the photocatalyst only,
we carried out blank experiments without a photocatalyst under visible-light
irradiation (photolysis). A 300 W xenon lamp (Max 303, 1 sun light)
was used as the light source (light intensity, 50 mW cm–2), which was located approximately 6 cm to one side of the solution.
A glass filter was used to remove the UV light and IR light (Hoya,
77 mm, wavelength of UV < 390 nm and IR > 700 nm). At 10 min
intervals,
the photocatalysts were separated by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for
10 min and the light absorption of a clear solution of the different
photocatalysts was recorded using an UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer).

Photocatalytic
H2 production was measured using a lab-made experimental
setup. A 300 W xenon lamp (Max 303 model) (λ > 400 nm) with
an intensity of 50 mW cm–2 was used as the light
source and placed parallel to the reactor. In a typical photocatalytic
H2 production trial, 5 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed
in 50 mL of 5% aqueous glycerol solution with vigorous stirring and
the stirring was continuous so that uniform irradiation of the photocatalyst
suspension was achieved throughout the tests. Prior to irradiation,
the system was subjected to vacuum to remove dissolved oxygen from
the solution. The solution was then purged with N2 gas.
The generated gas was collected each hour, and the hydrogen content
was determined by gas chromatography (6500GC System, YL Instruments,
with thermal conductivity detector). Helium was used as the carrier
gas.
