Nitrogen
and sulfur codoped and completely renewable carbons were
synthesized from two types of algae, Spirulina Platensis and Chlorella Vulgaris, without any
additional nitrogen fixation reaction. The type of activation agents,
char-forming temperature, activation agent-to-char ratio, and activation
temperature were all varied to optimize the reaction conditions for
this synthesis. The maximum Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area and total pore volumes of the carbons were 2685 m2/g and 1.4 cm3/g, respectively. The nitrogen and sulfur
contents of the carbons were in the range of 0.9–5.69 at. %
and 0.05–0.2 at. %, respectively. The key nitrogen functionalities
were pyridinic, amino, and pyridonic/pyrrolic groups, whereas the
key sulfur functionalities were S–C, O–S–C, and
SOx groups. CO2 adsorption
isotherms were measured at 273, 298, and 313 K, and the ideal adsorbed
solution theory was employed to calculate the selectivity of adsorption
of CO2 over N2 and simulate binary adsorption
isotherms. The adsorption results demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption amount and the heat of CO2 adsorption were
higher for carbons with higher nitrogen content, confirming the influence
of nitrogen functionality in CO2 adsorption. The overall
results suggested that these algae-derived renewable carbons can serve
as potential adsorbents for CO2 separation from N2.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heteroatom-doped
carbons have gained significant attention for
their remarkable properties that are not manifested by pure carbons.
Although oxygen is commonly present in most kinds of carbons, boron
(B), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorous (P) are considered
as the key heteroatoms. These elements can improve the electronic
properties, including tunable band gap of host carbon, easy availability
of lone pairs of electrons, thermal stability and durability, higher
charging and polarizability, and superior conductivity. These properties
can be harnessed into better metal-free oxygen reduction reaction
catalysts, ultracapacitor electrodes, drug delivery, and selective
separation of few important species, including isolation of greenhouse
gases, acid gases, or environmental remediation of heavy metals from
the water stream. More details of these usages can be found elsewhere.1−3

Among all of the heteroatom-doped carbons, nitrogen- and sulfur-doped
carbons were most commonly synthesized and applied for different specific
applications.1 As carbon precedes nitrogen
in the periodic table, it is easier to incorporate nitrogen into the
carbon matrix. Although the catalytic role of nitrogen-doped carbons
may originate from the variation of the electronic charge profile
of a carbon atom from the more electronegative nitrogen atom and the
interactions of the lone pair of electrons from the pyridinic nitrogen
site,4−6 the exact nature of interactions between adsorbate
molecules and nitrogen-doped carbons could be far more complex. It
was shown that nitrogen-doped porous carbons could adsorb up to 5.48
and 8.6 mmol/g CO2 at 298 and 273 K, respectively, and
at an ambient pressure. This was probably the highest ever CO2 adsorbed amount reported for carbon-based materials under
similar conditions.7

Sulfur doping,
on the other hand, creates another unique type of
configuration on the parent carbon surface. Unlike nitrogen, sulfur
atoms are much larger and protrude out of the graphene plane, creating
an uneven surface with some unique properties. These properties include
superconductivity, polarizability, or other unique interactions with
neighboring atoms.8−10 For CO2 adsorption in sulfur-doped porous
carbons, it was demonstrated that the heat of adsorption was as high
as 59–65 kJ/mol at zero loading,11,12 which was
higher than any other carbon material reported so far. Oxidized sulfur
functionalities are more prone to interact with CO2,13,14 thus increasing its overall adsorption capacity. Although different
types of B–N, P–N, or even B–P–N doped
carbons were reported in the literature,1 synthesis of N–S dual-doped carbons is relatively rare,15,16 and in those cases, two types of raw proteins were employed as the
carbon precursor.15,21

Although there is an increased
interest in heteroatom-doped carbon
materials worldwide, the precursors of those carbons are limited to
synthetic precursors, including heteroatom-containing carbon polymers,
ionic liquids, proteins, and nanocarbons such as graphene and carbon
nanotubes. Low availability, high cost, and hazardous synthesis conditions
limit the universal use of these precursors. In this work, algae is
used as a natural, inexpensive, and environmentally benign precursor.
Several species of algae can accumulate a large amount of protein
within their cellular biomass, and this protein can serve as a source
of nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms. Algae is naturally highly abundant
and grows very fast by rapid photosynthesis, thereby utilizing the
atmospheric CO2. Utilizing algae as a natural precursor
for carbon instead of synthetic precursors will help maintain the
carbon cycle by limiting the emission of additional CO2 to the atmosphere in the course of synthesis. Glucose and algae
mass (Spirulina Platensis) have been
used together in the synthesis via a hydrothermal reaction that provided
low CO2 emission during carbonization and higher fixation
of nitrogen with a Maillard type of reaction between the algae protein
and glucose.17 However, this approach has
one basic problem. Maillard reaction results in over 50% of the final
carbon originating from a nonrenewable glucose.17 Additionally, although this carbon has up to 6.4–11.4%
nitrogen, it remains nonporous and is thus unfit for most applications.
Activation with potassium hydroxide increases the porosity but lowers
the nitrogen content to 1.09–4.65% and provides a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area of 1260–2390 m2/g.23 A similar approach to synthesize porous carbon
from another type of algae (Nannochloropsis Salina) resulted in a nitrogen content of 0.84–4.5% with a BET surface
area of 284–1538 m2/g.18 Furthermore, past research work did not report the sulfur content
of the resultant carbon because it may also originate from the protein
content of the algae.

In this work, we have employed two species
of algae, S. Platensis and Chlorella Vulgaris, which have a high protein content
of 70 and 65%, respectively, as
specified by the commercial vendor. No nitrogen-fixing Maillard type
of reaction was employed in the course of synthesis. In a two-step
synthesis to produce heteroatom-doped porous carbons, a char is obtained
followed by its activation with KOH and CO2. In the course
of synthesis, the parameters that were varied were the char-forming
temperature, the activation temperature, and the char-to-KOH ratio.
A large set of carbons synthesized in this process was examined with
CO2 and N2 adsorption to investigate their role
in carbon capture. Furthermore, we have also elaborated the correlation
between the nitrogen content and adsorbed amount of CO2 and the heat of CO2 adsorption.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Pore Textural Properties
Results
of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of raw spirulina and chlorella
under a nitrogen atmosphere are given in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
plots at 77 K for spirulina- and chlorella-derived carbons are shown
in Figure 1a,b. The
sharp rise in the adsorption isotherm indicates microporosity, but
the presence of small hysteresis loops for few carbons signifies the
possible presence of mesoporosity as well. The hysteresis loops were
more prominent for chlorella-derived carbons. The BET specific surface
area, micropore volume, and total pore volume were calculated from
the N2 adsorption data and are shown in Table 1a,b. As observed in Figure 1b, there is a presence
of a small amount of mesoporosity in chlorella-derived carbons that
are not observed in spirulina-derived ones. Although the exact reason
may be difficult to establish because of the heterogeneous nature
of the algal cells, the possible reason may be attributed to the dissolving
of mineral matters (ash) from the carbon mass during the washing of
the carbons, thereby generating an empty space (mesopores) in the
carbon matrix. The BET specific surface area (SSA) for KOH-activated
carbons varies within 1217–2613 m2/g for spirulina-derived
carbons and from 1027 to 2685 m2/g for chlorella-derived
carbons. The maximum micropore volume and the total pore volume of
these sets of carbons were 0.92 and 1.40 cm3/g, respectively,
and they were obtained from chlorella. Upon increasing the KOH-to-char
ratio from 2 to 4 at the same temperature of 700 °C, the BET
SSA increased monotonically for chlorella-derived carbons, but it
turned lower for spirulina-derived carbons at the highest KOH content.
Most likely, a relatively weaker cell wall of spirulina was susceptible
to over-burning, giving rise to lowering of the available surface
area. The high activation temperature of 850 °C yielded the highest
BET SSA and pore volume in all of the carbons that were activated
by KOH. The BET SSA as well as the pore volume of the carbons that
were produced from low temperature char (300 °C) is the lowest
among all of the KOH-activated carbons, and the BET SSA is within
1027–1299 m2/g. As Table 1 reveals, increasing the KOH content during
the activation for this type of char did not change the pore textural
properties significantly in the resultant carbons. It is also quite
imperative to mention that we tried to synthesize porous carbons by
one-step activation of the algae by directly carbonizing the pristine
algae and KOH mixtures. However, the entire product was converted
to liquid tar without any solid (carbon) residue. CO2 activation
of the char at 850 °C revealed the lowest BET SSA (147–326
m2/g) as well as the pore volume. The BET surface area,
micropore volume, and total pore volume of our algae-derived carbons
were higher than that of KOH-activated carbons from N. Salina(20) and spirulina-derived
carbons19 reported in the literature. The
maximum BET SSA and total pore volume of the carbons obtained from
spirulina were 2390 m2/g and 1.15 cm3/g, respectively,
as observed in the literature.19 The pore
textural properties of KOH-activated N. salina-derived char were even lower; the maximum BET SSA and total pore
volume were 1538 m2/g and 0.69 cm3/g, respectively.18 It is worth mentioning that both types of carbons
were obtained via a hydrothermal reaction between algal biomass and
glucose, and hence over 50% of the carbon mass might have originated
from glucose itself.19 The low porosity
of the carbons activated by CO2 may have contributed to
the presence of a hard and resistive cell wall of algae that could
not be fully broken by a weaker oxidizing agent such as CO2. The burn-off level for CO2 activation is around 50%.
We did not try to further optimize the CO2 activation level
owing to the poor pore textural properties of the resultant carbons.

The nonlocal density
functional theory (NLDFT)-based pore size
distribution plots for all the carbons are calculated from N2 adsorption at 77 K and CO2 adsorption at 273 K20,21 (Figure 1c,d). From
these plots, it is clear that both spirulina- and chlorella-derived
carbons have similar pores that were synthesized under similar conditions.
All KOH-activated carbons have several disordered ultramicropores,
and the pore widths are in the range of 4.8–8 Å along
with a larger micropore width within 15 Å. Few of the carbons
that depicted the hysteresis loop in the N2 adsorption–desorption
plot at 77 K demonstrated a small and wide mesopore within 23–24
Å. CO2-activated carbons demonstrated much smaller
number of pores that might also contribute to the lower porosity of
these carbons.

2.2 Material Characteristics
The material
characteristics of these samples include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To minimize the number
of samples for XPS analysis and subsequent adsorption studies, we
selected a total of 10 samples with better pore textural properties
and therefore eliminated S(1/2):(300/700), C(1/2):(300/700), and all
CO2-activated samples for further analysis. Hypothetical
schemes of different functionalities that may be detected by XPS are
shown in Figure 2a.
Peak fitting results for nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen functionalities
are shown in Figure 2b–d, respectively. Detailed quantifications of the functional
groups obtained from XPS results are shown in Table 2a,b for spirulina- and chlorella-derived
carbons, respectively. The nitrogen contents lie within 0.9–5.69
and 0.7–5.0 at. % for spirulina- and chlorella-derived carbons,
respectively. Different nitrogen functionalities that were detected
through XPS are pyridinic, amino, pyrrolic/pyridonic, graphitic, and
nitro/nitroso (NOx) groups. The largest
three nitrogen functionalities that dominate these carbons are pyridinic,
amino, and pyrrolic/pyridinic. They are also the key contributors
in CO2 capture, as discussed in the Introduction. Although both nitrogen and sulfur contents of these carbons originated
from the protein components of the algae cells, the sulfur content
is much smaller compared to nitrogen because of the lower sulfur content
of the protein itself and the higher tendency of the sulfur atom to
be dissociated from the carbon matrix owing to its larger size. The
largest quantitative contribution of sulfur is within 0.17–0.2
at. %, and that can be successfully distributed to S–C, O–S–C,
and SOx functionalities only. It is quite
intuitive to notice that the severe synthesis conditions, including
larger dose of KOH or exposure to higher temperature in the course
of synthesis, lowered the nitrogen and sulfur functionalities, and
therefore, the carbons that were produced from the 300 °C char
or only the 1:2 ratio of char-to-KOH retained the maximum amounts
of N or S functionalities. It is also important to note that these
carbons have lower pore textural properties, and hence a tradeoff
was established between nitrogen/sulfur functionalities and pore textural
properties. XPS also successfully detected few mineral matters associated
with Mg, Ca, Na, and K and most likely originating from the algae
cell itself or the partial residue of the activation agents (K only).
Both mineral matters and oxygen contents are found to be higher in
chlorella-derived carbons. To compare with the literature, it should
be mentioned that the nitrogen contents in spirulina19 and nannochloropsis18-derived
activated carbons retained about 1.09–4.65 and 0.84–4.53
at. % nitrogen, respectively, along with the nitrogen-fixing Maillard
reaction. Hydrothermally synthesized carbon from spirulina demonstrated
as high as 7.1–11.4 at. % nitrogen,17 but it did not undergo any activation result and therefore can be
regarded as nonporous. None of the past results reported the sulfur
content of the carbons. To the best of our knowledge, our work, for
the first time, reports the nitrogen- and sulfur-doped carbons from
algal biomass without any nitrogen-fixing Maillard reaction and can
be considered as completely renewable carbon.

To investigate the external shape and morphology
of these carbons
under SEM imaging, two representative carbons from each type of algae
(spirulina and chlorella), including S(1/2):(700/700), C(1/2):(700/700),
S(1/3):(700/850), and C(1/3):(700/850), were selected. It is observed
that the bulk size of carbon particles (Figure S2, Supporting Information) for chlorella-derived carbons is higher
than that of spirulina-derived carbons. The size of chlorella-derived
carbons (inset of Figure S2b,d, Supporting Information) is about 20–60 μm, whereas the size of spirulina-derived
carbons (inset of Figure S2a,c, Supporting Information) is about 40–80 μm. High-resolution SEM images suggest
that the surface of spirulina-derived carbons (Figure 3a,c) is very rough and consists of several
cracks and crevices. These crevices are as large as 200 nm and hence
contribute to the macropore nature of these carbons. On the contrary,
the surface of chlorella-derived carbons is very smooth with much
narrower cavities of 20–50 nm (Figure 3a,c).

to 100 nm. The SEM images in micron size are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

2.3 Adsorption and Separation
Results
CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms
at a pressure
up to 760 Torr are shown in Figure 4a–d. The magnified plot of N2 adsorption
at 298 K is provided in Figures S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information. CO2 and N2 adsorption
isotherms at 298 are shown in Figure 4a,b for spirulina- and chlorella-derived carbons, respectively.
The spirulina- and chlorella-derived carbons adsorbed 3–4 and
2.75–4.3 mmol/g of CO2, respectively. For both carbons,
N2 adsorption is 0.25–0.5 mmol/g, respectively.
At 273 K, as expected, the amount of CO2 adsorbed increased
to 6.2–6.7 mmol/g. The shapes of CO2 adsorption
isotherms resemble type-I isotherms, whereas the N2 adsorption
isotherms are linear (Henry’s law type) signifying a weaker
interaction between N2 and the carbon surface at room temperature
(298 K). CO2 adsorption at 313 K is shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S5 and S6). It
should be emphasized that the carbons obtained from the char at 300
°C [C or S(1/1):(300/700)] demonstrated the highest CO2 uptake at all temperatures despite having the lowest BET SSA and
micropore volume among all carbons. Such a result can be explained
by the presence of abundant nitrogen (and sulfur) functionalities
in these carbons. CO2 adsorbed amounts at 298 K and 760
Torr were 3.8–4.5 mmol/g in the previous publication on spirulina-derived
and KOH-activated carbon,19 and the maximum
CO2 adsorbed amount was marginally higher than that of
our results. At 273 K, the CO2 adsorbed amount was 6.1–7.4
mmol/g in spirulina-derived carbon and 2–6 mmol/g in the carbons
obtained from N. Salina.18 Despite CO2 uptakes being slightly
lower than those of other nitrogen-doped carbons, like those obtained
from polyacrylonitrile,22,23 based on these results,
it can be concluded that the highest CO2 adsorption in
our carbons are in a range similar to that of other carbons obtained
from algae.

carbons, (b) CO2 and N2 adsorption at 298 K
for chlorella-derived carbons, (c) CO2 adsorption at 273
K for spirulina-derived carbons, and (d) CO2 adsorption
at 273 K for chlorella-derived carbons. For better visibility, the
N2 adsorption plots in both types of carbons are shown
separately in Figures S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information.

To further correlate
the CO2 adsorbed amounts with the
pore textural properties and chemical functionalities, the CO2 adsorbed amounts at 298 K and 760 Torr were plotted with
respect to BET SSA, micropore volume, and nitrogen functionalities
(Figure 5a–d).
Although C or S(1/1): (300/700) has 0.17–0.2 at. % sulfur that
may have contributed to CO2 adsorption, we did not make
an attempt to make similar plots with respect to sulfur functionalities,
owing to very small sulfur contents in those carbons. From Figure 5a,b, it is clear
that there is a decreasing trend of CO2 adsorbed with an
increase in the BET SSA and micropore volume for both spirulina- and
chlorella-derived carbons. This trend is unusual and inconsistent
with the other results that we have reported for other biomass-derived
carbons without any nitrogen or sulfur functionalities.24 On the contrary, it is observed that CO2 adsorption increases sharply with the increase in the nitrogen
content and eventually flattens off at the highest nitrogen content
(Figure 5c). Despite
simple acid–base interactions between CO2 and different
types of amine groups present on the carbon surface, several computation
studies revealed the nature of interactions between CO2 and different other types of nitrogen functionalities. CO2 adsorption in nitrogen-doped carbons were studied by computation
techniques, and the results confirmed that few specific types of nitrogen
functionalities indeed influence CO2 adsorption. It has
been theoretically established that acid–base interactions
between the amine group and CO2, π–π
interactions between pyridinic/pyrrolic groups25 and CO2, hydrogen bonding between pyridone groups26,27 and CO2, and Lewis acid–base interactions between
pyridinic groups and CO2 play key roles in the elevated
adsorption of CO2. It has also been demonstrated by density
functional theory (DFT) calculations that the average binding energy
between CO2 and nitrogen-containing complexes is about
7.84 kJ/mol compared to 1.26 kJ/mol for pure carbons.26 To further refine the dependence of CO2 adsorption
on amine, pyridinic, and pyrrolic nitrogen on carbon, we have narrowed
down [see Figure 5d]
the types of nitrogen functionalities to these functionalities only;
however, the trend appears to be similar to that of Figure 5c for these types of carbons.
In this context, it is also worth mentioning that other types of basicity
that may be present on the carbon surface also contribute to the acid
gas adsorption, such as CO2. Computational studies suggested
that few oxygen-containing groups, such as chromene, ketones, or pyrones,
may act like basic sites28,29 and hence influence
CO2 adsorption. Furthermore, it was also suggested that
the delocalized electrons on the graphene plane of carbon also add
to the overall basicity of the carbon,28 and hence facilitate CO2 capture. We could not explicitly
quantify the contribution of these functionalities in our system as
there is no well-acceptable strategy to quantify them.

amount at 298 K and 760 Torr as a function
of the (a) BET SSA, (b) micropore volume, (c) total nitrogen content
(at. %), and (d) amine, pyridinic, and pyrrolic nitrogen contents
(at. %) (d).

In this context, it should
be mentioned that we did not make an
explicit attempt to correlate the sulfur functionalities with CO2 adsorption. The role of sulfur functionalities on CO2 adsorption is not as explicitly defined as that of nitrogen
functionalities. In the past computational research (DFT), it was
claimed that CO2 may react with mono- or dioxidized sulfur
owing to the high negative charge of oxygen atom caused by the high
positive charge on the sulfur atom.30 Grand
canonical Monte Carlo simulation also claimed that the presence of
sulfur may also increase CO2 adsorption in graphene planes
because of the electron overlap between CO2 and sulfur
functionalities.31 In our system, the sulfur
content is extremely low (refer to Table 2a,b), less than 0.2 at. %, and that did not
allow us to detect the individual functionalities. We believe that
it is very difficult to establish the explicit role of sulfur functionalities
based on such a low content, if there is any. Furthermore, the positive
role of sulfur may also be masked by nitrogen functionalities, owing
to its large content and a more pronounced effect toward CO2 adsorption.

The kinetics of CO2 adsorption at 298
K for all carbons
are shown in Figure 6. Spirulina-derived carbons reached the saturation level of uptake
within about 100 s. Although two of the chlorella-derived carbons
[C(1/1):(300/700) and C(1/3):(300/850)] reached the saturation level
within 50 s, the rest of those carbons took about 150 s to reach saturation.
The kinetic profiles of these materials seem very similar, and the
overall nature of saturation did not reveal any particular correlation
with the pore textural properties or the nitrogen functionality.

carbons and (b) chlorella-derived carbons.

Because the key adsorption need for CO2 lies with
its
separation from N2 in a flue gas mixture mostly emitting
from the coal-driven power plants, it is a common practice to report
the selectivity of CO2 with respect to N2 in
a binary mixture of CO2 and N2. Selectivity
(SCO2/N2) is defined
as 1  where x and y designate the adsorbed phase and the bulk mole fraction
of CO2 and N2, respectively. The most common
method of
calculating selectivity from pure component adsorption data is the
ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). In this theory, it is assumed
that the adsorbed phase resembles an ideal solution, and the gas behaves
like an ideal gas mixture. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the mole
fractions of the species in the bulk are related to those in the adsorbed
phase through equations resembling Raoult’s law in chemical
thermodynamics. The selectivity values for all carbons at 298 K as
a function of the total pressure are given in Figure 7a,b for spirulina- and chlorella-derived
carbons, respectively. For the calculation, the mole fraction of CO2 and N2 in the bulk is chosen as 0.15 and 0.85,
respectively, as it mimics the flue gas composition. For the carbons,
the selectivity decreases with increasing pressure. For spirulina-derived
carbons, the maximum selectivity is demonstrated by S(1/4):(700/700)
followed by S(1/1):(300/700). For chlorella-derived carbons, the maximum
selectivity is exhibited by C(1/1):(300/700). It should be mentioned
that the maximum CO2 adsorption was shown by S(1/1):(300/700)
and C(1/1):(300/700) (i.e., carbons obtained from low-temperature
char with the highest nitrogen and sulfur functionalities), and these
materials also demonstrated the relatively higher selectivity. Furthermore,
the carbons that demonstrated the maximum surface area and pore volume
[i.e., S(1/3):(700/850) or S(1/3):(700/850)] exhibited the lowest
CO2 selectivity and adsorption capacity as shown in Figure 4a,b.

Figure 7 IAST-based selectivity
for CO2/N2 in (a)
spirulina- and (b) chlorella-derived carbons at 298 K. For all cases,
the mole fraction of CO2 and N2 in the bulk
are set to 0.15 and 0.85, respectively.

The IAST method was also applied to calculate the binary
or mixed
adsorption isotherms for CO2 and N2 in the gas
mixtures. The equilibrium adsorption amounts, qCO2 and qN2 (mmol/g), can be calculated from the relation of qCO2 = xCO2q and qN2 = xN2q, where the symbols bear their usual meaning. According to the IAST
method, the total adsorbed amount, q, can be calculated
from the following ideal solution formula 2  where q1* and q2* indicate the adsorbed
amounts of pure species at the same temperature and spreading pressure
(surface potential) as the binary mixture and are obtained from experimental
pure component adsorption isotherms, as shown in Figure 4. For computational purposes,
the pure component adsorption isotherms were fitted to the Sips equation.
The binary adsorption isotherms for S(1/1):(300/700) and C(1/1):(300/700)
are shown in Figure 8a–d as a function of the total pressure (at a constant mole
fraction of CO2 of 0.15) and the mole fraction of CO2 (at the constant total pressure of 760 Torr). Similar results
for the rest of the carbons are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S7–S10) section.

simulated binary adsorption isotherms for CO2 and N2 as a function of pressure (for bulk mole fraction
of CO2: 0.15) for (a) S(1/1):(300/700) and (b) C(1/1):(300/700);

and (d) C(1/1):(300/700). Similar plots for the rest of the carbons
are given in Figures S7–S10 in the Supporting Information.

The enthalpy or heat
of adsorption is calculated by the Van’t
Hoff equation 3  where ΔH is the enthalpy
or heat of adsorption, P is the pressure, T is the temperature, and a is the adsorption
amount. Integration of Van’t Hoff equation translates to 4  where C is a constant of
integration. The slope of the ln P versus 1/T plot at a fixed adsorbed amount provides the heat of adsorption.
The heat of adsorption of CO2 in the adsorbents synthesized
is shown in Figure 9a in terms of the adsorbed amount. Except C(1/4):(700/700), the heat
of adsorption of CO2 decreases with the adsorbed amount,
designating a traditional energetically heterogeneous carbon surface.
The heat of adsorption at higher adsorbed amounts is higher for samples
generated with low-temperature char and contained higher nitrogen
content [S(1/1):(300/700) and C(1/1):(300/700)]. This trend is similar
to the adsorption capacity and selectivity. As observed in the literature,
the heat of CO2 adsorption in the nitrogen-doped carbons
synthesized from N. Salina was in the
range of 30–26 kJ/mol. This is within the CO2 adsorbed
amounts of 0–2.4 mmol/g,18 whereas
the heat of adsorption is within 22–30 kJ/mol at the adsorbed
amount of 0.7 mmol/g for spirulina-derived carbons.19 From the plot, it is observed that several of our carbons
have demonstrated higher heat of adsorption at the same CO2 adsorbed amount than those previously reported for nitrogen-doped
carbons synthesized from algal biomass. To correlate the heat of adsorption
with the nitrogen content, we plotted the values of heat of adsorption
with respect to the total nitrogen content at a fixed adsorbed amount
of 2 mmol/g (the “maximum” adsorbed amount available
for all samples, as observed in Figure 9a), and the results are shown in Figure 9b. As observed in this figure, the heat of
adsorption increases with nitrogen content, which may indicate an
influence of nitrogen functionality on CO2 adsorption.

Figure 9 (a) Heat
of CO2 adsorption in spirulina- and chlorella
derived carbons and (b) heat of CO2 adsorption at the adsorbed
amount of 2 mmol/g as a function of the nitrogen content.

The working capacity can be calculated as the difference
between
the adsorption capacity at 1 bar and the desorption capacity at 0.1
bar at a constant temperature of 298 K. In this study, two carbons
from spirulina and chlorella, [S(1/1):(300/700) and C(1/1):(300/700)],
were chosen as they demonstrated both higher adsorption capacity and
selectivity. The adsorption and desorption capacities were measured
under continuous cycles of nine adsorption and desorption branches,
and the results are shown in Figure 10. It is observed that both the carbons demonstrated
excellent stability without significant deterioration after nine cycles.

Figure 10 Working
capacity of spirulina- and chlorella-derived carbons in
multiple cycles.

The dynamic column experiment
was performed to study the breakthrough
behavior of CO2 and N2 in the carbons that may
simulate a real-world separation. The breakthrough results are shown
in Figure 10. The
difference in the breakthrough time between N2 and CO2 is 1.625 and 4.4 min for S(1/2):(700/700) and C(1/2):(700/700),
respectively. The large difference in the breakthrough time for CO2 in chlorella-derived carbons can be attributed to its larger
mass compared to spirulina-derived carbons in the dynamic column.
It is also obvious that altering the mass of the carbon in the dynamic
column study will change the breakthrough time of CO2.
The delay in the breakthrough time between N2 and CO2 suggests a possible separation of those gases. The sharpness
of the outlet concentration
profiles is indicative of the importance of axial diffusion effects
that may affect the quality of a large-scale industrial separation
(Figure 11).

outlet concentrations) from dynamic column experiments.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbons were synthesized
from two types of algae, S. platensis and C. vulgaris, with a BET specific
surface and pore volume as high as 2685 m2/g and 1.4 cm3/g, respectively. The nitrogen and sulfur functionalities
were in the range of 0.9–5.69 and 0.05–0.2 at %, respectively.
Harsh synthesis conditions, including higher temperature or larger
KOH mass, enhanced the pore textural properties but decreased the
nitrogen and sulfur functionalities. CO2 adsorption was
measured at 273, 298, and 313 K and at a pressure up to 760 Torr,
and the results suggested that the CO2 adsorbed amount
decreased with the BET SSA and micropore volume but increased with
nitrogen functionality. The IAST-based selectivity for CO2 and N2 adsorption at 298 K also suggests that the porous
carbons with higher nitrogen functionality possess better selectivity.
The calculated heats of adsorption revealed that carbons with higher
nitrogen content exhibit higher heat of CO2 adsorption
that further confirmed the influence of N2 functionality
in CO2 adsorption. The breakthrough behavior of a mixture
of CO2 and N2 was studied through dynamic column
experiments. The overall results suggest that algae-derived carbons
can serve as potential adsorbents for CO2 separation from
N2.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
Spirulina (spray
dried, food grade, protein content: 70%, total ash: 8.33%, moisture:
4.7%) and chlorella (spray dried, food grade, protein content: 65.1%,
total ash: 6.0%, moisture: 4.9%) were obtained from commercial sources
(buyalgae.com) and
used without any further modification. In the course of synthesis,
the reaction parameters that were varied are the types of algae (Spirulina or Chlorella), char-forming temperature, ratio of char to potassium hydroxide,
and activation temperature. All char-forming and activation operations
were performed in an inert atmosphere with N2 (flow rate
40 cm3/min). Typically, algae was placed in a porcelain
boat and the boat was inserted in a Lindberg/Blue tube furnace. Two
different char-forming temperatures were used, 300 and 700 °C.
To obtain a char-forming temperature of 300 °C, the temperature
of the furnace was ramped at a rate of 5 °C/min, whereas for
700 °C, it was ramped at a rate of 10 °C/min. The materials
were dwelled at the final temperature for 2 min and then cooled to
room temperature. The char was activated by mixing 3 g with potassium
hydroxide at a ratio of 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. During activation, the
char and KOH mixture was placed in an alumina boat and inserted in
the tube furnace. The temperature was ramped to 700 °C or 850
°C at a rate of 10 °C/min and then immediately cooled to
room temperature. To activate using CO2, 1 g of char (formed
at 700 °C) was placed in a porcelain boat and inserted in the
tube furnace. The temperature of the furnace was ramped to 850 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min in N2 flow. Then, the gas was
switched to CO2 (50 cm3/min) and held to the
final temperature for 100 min. The gas was finally switched back to
N2, and the furnace was cooled to room temperature. All
activated samples were washed several times with copious amounts of
deionized water till the pH of the wash water was close to 7. The
samples that were activated by KOH are labeled as S(x/y):(T1/T2) or
C(x/y):(T1/T2), where C or S stands for chlorella or spirulina, (x/y) is the ratio of char to KOH, T1 is the char-forming temperature, and T2 is the activation temperature. The samples that were activated
with CO2 are termed as S(CO2):(700/850) or C(CO2):(700/850), where S or C has their usual meaning.

4.2 Sample Characterization
The pore
textural properties for all samples were characterized by the BET
specific surface area and pore size distribution. The BET surface
area was calculated from the N2 adsorption–desorption
plot at 77 K measured by a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-Any Gas instrument.
The NLDFT-based pore size distribution was obtained by analyzing N2 adsorption at 77 K and CO2 adsorption at 273 K
in the same instrument. Samples were selected based upon pore textural
properties for further characterization by XPS for surface functionality
and SEM for particle size and shape. XPS data was obtained in a Thermo
Fisher K-Alpha instrument with an Al Kα X-ray anode. The energy
of the X-ray was 1486.6 eV and that of the solution was 0.5 eV. The
sample was mounted on a carbon tape, and the charge neutralization
was performed by 2 eV Ar+ ions. SEM images were obtained
in a Carl Zeiss Merlin SEM microscope operating at 1 kV.

4.3 Gas Adsorption Studies
Gas adsorption
studies were performed in the same Quantachrome’s Autosorb-iQ-Any
Gas instrument. All samples that underwent the extended sample characterization
were analyzed with CO2 adsorption at 272, 298, and 313
K and N2 adsorption at 298 K and up to 1 bar pressure.
Each sample was outgassed to 300 °C before the adsorption experiment.
All gases were of ultrahigh purity grade. The temperature was maintained
by a Julabo external chiller with a 1:1 mixture of water and propylene
glycol as the chilling fluid. The working capacity of two of the adsorbents
from spirulina and chlorella were measured under nine continuous cycles
of adsorption and desorption at 298 K in the same instrument under
the “hysteresis” mode.

The dynamic column experiments
were performed in a custom-made dynamic column with a packed bed volume
of 0.655 cm3. In all studies, the volume ratio of CO2 and N2 in the mixed gas streams was maintained
as 15:85 by two mass flow controllers (FMA5502A, Omega Engineering
Inc.). The experiment was conducted with two different carbons, 0.222
and 0.295 g of S(1/1):(700/700) and C(1/1):(700/700). Both the carbons
were outgassed prior to analysis as mentioned in the adsorption section.
The gas composition at the outlet of the bed was monitored by a Hewlett
Packard 5989B mass spectrophotometer. The response of the mass spectrophotometer
was calibrated against a known set of gas concentrations prior to
the dynamic column experiment.
