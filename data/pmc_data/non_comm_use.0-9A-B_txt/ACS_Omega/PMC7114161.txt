Gold
nanoparticles are utilized in a variety of sensing and detection
technologies because of their unique physiochemical properties. Their
tunable size, shape, and surface charge enable them to be used in
an array of platforms. The purpose of this study is to conduct a thorough
spectroscopic characterization of Au and functionalized hybrid Au@SiO2 nanoparticles under physiological conditions and in the presence
of two proteins known to be abundant in serum, bovine serum albumin
and human ubiquitin. The information obtained from this study will
enable us to develop design principles to synthesize an array of surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy-based nanoparticles as platforms for theranostic
applications. We are particularly interested in tailoring the surface
chemistry of the Au@SiO2 nanoparticles for applications
in theranostic technologies. We employ common spectroscopic techniques,
with particular emphasis on circular dichroism and heteronuclear single
quantum correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (HSQC NMR) spectroscopy,
as combinatorial tools to understand protein conformational dynamics,
binding site interactions, and protein corona for the design of nanoparticles
capable of reaching their intended target in vivo. Our results conclude
that protein adsorption onto the nanoparticle surface prevents nanoparticle
aggregation. We observed that varying the ionic strength and type
of ion influences the aggregation and aggregation rate of each respective
nanoparticle. The conformation of proteins and the absorption of proteins
on the surface of Au nanoparticles are also influenced by ionic strength.
Using two-dimensional [15N–1H]-HSQC NMR
experiments to compare the interactions of Au and Au@SiO2 nanoparticles with 15N-ubiquitin, we observed small chemical
shift perturbations in some amino acid peaks and differences in binding
site interactions with ubiquitin and respective nanoparticles.

Introduction
The utilization of
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as
an analytical tool has increased due to innovative developments and
design of advanced spectroscopic instrumentation, theoretical modeling,
and nanofabrication techniques. Initially discovered by Fleischmann
et al. in 1974, SERS has been applied in an array of technologies,
imaging, sensing, and detection.1−6 The technique has even enabled researchers to observe biological
and chemical phenomena at the single molecule level.7−10 The popularity of SERS in biomedical applications results from the
development of Raman reporters and functionalized substrates that
have enabled the extension of excitation wavelengths over a wide range
and ability for a single wavelength to excite multiple species (multiplexing).11−13

Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) metals are the most commonly used
substrates
in SERS due to their optical, electrical, thermal, and magnetic properties.
Their optical properties enable the extension of their local surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption peak into the visible and extended
near-infrared regions.3,14,15 The merits of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) make them a preferred choice
in theranostic applications compared to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
for the following reasons: they have a higher physiochemical stability,
are less toxic, and have stronger laser-induced heating (enabling
greater thermal expansion into a physiological environment), and their
LSPR can be extended further into the visible and near IR regions
through manipulation of their size and shape.16−20 Silica encapsulation of noble metals improves their
stability in physiological environments and prevents the Raman reporter
from leaching out of the SERS nanoparticle.21 Silica is unique in that it offers a stable and inert mesoporous
scaffold. Silica is optically transparent on the submicrometer scale
and can be chemically modified with a variety of molecules using a
vast array of conjugation techniques.22−25 The mesoporous structure of silica
can also encapsulate dyes, drugs, and other nanoparticles.26−29 In addition, coating noble metals with silica enables the tuning
of their optical and chemical properties, which is achievable by varying
the thickness of the silica.30−42

Despite advances in the synthesis and assembly of these engineered
hybrid nanoparticles, only a few NPs have been approved by the FDA
for use in clinical settings with only one being SERS-based NP.43 Nanoparticles that have received FDA approval
in clinical settings include liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin and
protein-bound paclitaxel nanoparticles.44−46 Challenges in employing
nanoparticles in theranostic applications include their ability to
reach their intended target, penetration across cell and tissue barriers,
and cellular uptake and intra-organ distribution.47−49 These challenges
can be addressed by understanding nanoparticle–protein interactions,
particularly as a biocorona forms on the surface of nanoparticles
in vivo. The biocorona results from the adsorption of biological molecules,
proteins, lipids, and sugars onto the surface of the nanoparticles
as the nanoparticles are exposed to a dynamic and complex physiological
environment.50−53 The adsorption of proteins on the surface of the nanoparticle influences
protein conformational dynamics and their physiological function(s).54 Nanoparticle recognition, cellular uptake, and
intracellular location are also influenced.55−57

In this
study, we complete a side-by-side spectroscopic characterization
of SERS-functionalized nanoparticle scaffolds for applications in
theranostic technologies with particular emphasis on using 2D [15N–1H]-HSQC NMR spectroscopy to probe nanoparticle–protein
binding site interactions. NMR is a useful technique for investigating
the biomolecular structure, dynamics, intermolecular associations,
and protein–nanoparticle interactions.58 Solution NMR provides information on the local and global structural
dynamics of biomolecules and enables analysis over time scales ranging
from picoseconds to hours.59,60 We measured chemical
shift perturbations (CSPs) and intensity changes of proteins in the
presence of nanoparticles using heteronuclear single quantum correlation
(HSQC) NMR spectroscopy. In HSQC, the CSPs of coupled 1H and 15N in molecules are monitored over time, generating
a specific peak pattern unique to each. Upon binding to a nanoparticle,
line widths and peak intensities corresponding to group frequencies
within the molecule are altered. Therefore, HSQC can be used to identify
locations on the protein where binding occurs.

We have investigated
the interactions between human ubiquitin and
NP1 and NP2 using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Ubiquitin
(hUbq) is a small regulatory protein containing 76 amino acids and
is involved in the preparation of proteins for degradation. Its secondary
structure includes a long α-helix, a short piece of 3(10)-helix,
and a β-sheet with five strands. hUbq is a small cysteine-free
protein whose binding to bare gold nanoparticles has been characterized
by employing NMR.61 Therefore, we decided
to use hUbq to serve as a benchmark to evaluate future nanoparticles
developed in our laboratory. Combined, the information obtained from
the spectroscopic techniques will enable us to develop design principles
to evaluate functionalized Au@SiO2 nanoparticles as SERS
scaffolds for theranostic technologies. We have synthesized gold and
hybrid functionalized gold nanoparticles according to methods reported
in the literature.62−64 For clarity and brevity, the nanoparticles are referenced
as NP1, NP2, and NP3 as described in the Experimental
Section herein.

Results and Discussion
AuNPs aggregate
under certain conditions.65−69 Upon aggregation, the surface plasmon band (SBP)
of AuNPs is red-shifted, a broadening of the absorption band occurs,
and the emergence of the localized surface plasmon band appears between
∼670 and 710 nm. Researchers have exploited the aggregation
properties of AuNPs to develop sensitive colorimetric assays. Singer
and Plotz (1956) developed an aggregation-based immunoassay technique
utilizing latex nanoparticles modified with antibodies capable of
binding antigens.70 An early developed
pregnancy test used gold nanoparticles modified with antibodies to
human chorionic gonadotropin, β-hCG. Mirkin et al. pioneered
the development of a colorimetric DNA hybridization assay using gold
nanoparticles.71 Following up on Mirkin’s
achievements, Rosenzweig and Thanh validated Mirkin’s assay
as a robust method to quantify antibodies in aqueous and serum samples.72 Other colorimetric assays that exploit the aggregation
properties of nanoparticles have been developed.2−5 However, in some applications,
nanoparticle aggregation is undesirable. Nanoparticle aggregation
influences their cellular uptake and toxicity and, thus, their applicability
in clinical and point of care (POC) settings.57 Coating nanoparticles with silica has been proven to reduce self-aggregation
rendering these nanoparticles applicable in POC settings. Herein,
we report on the characteristics and behavior of the nanoparticle
that we are interested in employing in various technologies. Understanding
nanoparticle aggregation will enable us to design nanoparticles with
variable specificity and efficacy in theranostic applications.

Results in
Water
Table 1 summarizes the radius, mobility, and zeta potential
of each nanoparticle. Based on the information in the table, AuNPs
(NP1) are monodispersed in water and exhibit lower net charge (zeta
potential) relative to NP2 and NP3. NP2 appears to be more polydisperse
relative to NP1 and NP3, with NP3 exhibiting a relatively narrower
size distribution. The radius distribution of each nanoparticle is
also presented in Figure 1 (left), confirming their similarity in size. The width of
the distribution is slightly different among the samples. It is not
obvious in the figure although if you look closely you can see the
slightly broader character of the yellow curve in the histogram (Figure 1, left).

a Values are averaged and standard
deviation of five measurements (mobility) or 10 measurements (radius).

The UV/vis absorption spectra
of each nanoparticle, in the presence
of water, are presented in Figure 1 (right). According to the spectrum of each respective
nanoparticle, in the presence of water, NP1 and NP2 are well dispersed
as indicated by the position and shape of their plasmon bands. However,
the plasmon band for NP3, in the presence of water, indicates a highly
aggregated state. There is a contradiction in the UV/vis data and
DLS data for NP3 indicating the occurrence of a more complex phenomenon.
It appears that strong hydrophobic interactions dominate the behavior
of NP3 compared to electrostatic repulsion. However, additional experiments
are ongoing to explain this phenomenon.

Results in the Presence
of Salt
Table 2 summarizes the radius, mobility, and zeta
potential of each nanoparticle in the presence of salt (0.1 M PBS).
The results conclude that only NP2 is well dispersed, while the other
two nanoparticles exhibit substantial aggregation, indicative of the
emergence and shape of the peak at ∼670 nm (Figure 2). Furthermore, the mean radius
of NP2 is the smallest and close to the water size although the distribution
is slightly wider, suggesting some degree of aggregation. Upon aggregation,
the surface plasmon band (SBP) of AuNPs is red-shifted, whereby a
broadening of the absorption band occurs and the emergence of the
localized surface plasmon band appears between ∼670 and 710
nm.

In aqueous solution, the citrate-coated
AuNPs are stabilized by
the negative charges on the nanoparticle surface. We investigated
the behavior of NP1 and NP2 in presence of salt by varying the concentration
of KCl from 0.05 to 0.1 M. The results conclude that the stability
of the AuNPs is compromised and the nanoparticles aggregate and precipitate
out of solution at high ionic strength (Figure 3, left). This phenomenon, “salt-induced
aggregation”, results as salts screen the stabilizing negative
charges on the surface of the nanoparticles.65

Figure 3 UV/vis
spectra comparing nanoparticles in the presence of variable
concentrations of KCl.

On the contrary, NP2
nanoparticles are stable at high ionic strength
(Figure 3, right).
The zeta potential data reliability (ZPDR) of citrate and protein-coated
AuNPs was investigated by Lou et al.73 They
reported that the ZPDR of AuNPs was highly dependent on both buffer
conditions and surface modifications. The ZPDR of citrate-coated AuNPs
was stable in water and unstable in 10 mM phosphate buffer (PB). A
substantial decrease in the absolute ZP values after each measurement
was observed due to the electrical field facilitated adsorption of
negatively charged phosphate ions on AuNPs. The Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) theory describes aggregation resulting when the equilibrium
between the sum of attractive and repulsive forces attributable to
mainly van der Waals and electrical double (EDL) forces is disrupted.67,74

The EDL is formed when a metal is placed in a liquid and counter
ions diffuse to the metal surface to neutralize their surface charge.
The EDL extends beyond the surface of the nanoparticle and consists
of two layers, the Stern layer and the diffuse layer where ions diffuse.
The slipping plane is the boundary between the solvated metal surface
and bulk liquid. The zeta potential is a measure of the surface potential
at this junction and related to particle mobility. The ionic strength
of the solution influences the EDL, particularly the diffuse layer,
and thus the zeta potential. The zeta potential can be used to provide
information regarding nanoparticle stability. Therefore, we completed
dynamic light scattering experiments to measure zeta potential and
size distribution of our nanoparticles under variable conditions of
ionic strength and in the presence of proteins.

Zeta potential
measurements in 0.1 M were calculated using Henry’s
equation, which takes into consideration ionic strength and hydrodynamic
radius. In the presence of salts, counterions screen the surface charge
on the surface of the nanoparticles. Salt reduces the electrostatic
potential of the nanoparticles and increases van der Waals attractive
forces causing them to aggregate. Counterions also decrease the electrophoretic
mobility of the nanoparticles. A more profound reduction in the electrophoretic
mobility of NP2 is observed relative to NP1 and NP3. A more profound
salt-induced aggregation effect is observed for NP1 and NP3 relative
to NP2 in the presence of salt.

Behavior of Nanoparticles
in the Presence of Proteins
A protein corona is formed when
nanoparticles come in contact with
biological fluids. Proteins adsorb with differential affinities for
the nanoparticle surface.50−52

We examined the adsorption
behaviors of the nanoparticles in the presence of BSA and hUbq using
spectroscopic methods. We chose these two proteins because of their
abundance in serum and role in various physiological processes. Our
results for NP1-protein conjugates are similar to those reported in
the literature (Figure 4, left), whereby a red shift and broadening of the absorption band
of AuNPs in the presence of BSA occurs, indicative of BSA adsorption
onto the surface of AuNPs.75,76 The absorption bands
are further red-shifted and widened as the concentration of BSA is
decreased, which is indicative of AuNP aggregation. A decrease in
the local surface plasmon intensity is also observed as the nanoparticle
and protein interact.

Figure 4 UV/vis spectra of NP1 (left) and NP2 (right) in the presence
of
variable concentrations of BSA.

The occurrence of red shifting and peak broadening for NP2-protein
conjugates is marginal (Figure 4, right) relative to NP1 (Figure 4, left) underscoring its application as a
sensor and/or sensor platform in various biomedical applications where
nanoparticle aggregation is undesirable. NP3-protein conjugates did
not exhibit a red shift or peak broadening but only a change in intensity,
as its spectrum indicates that it undergoes self-aggregation in the
presence of water and phosphate buffer (Figure S5). The propensity of NP3 to aggregate in the presence of
both water and salt is probably due to the strong hydrophobic intra-attraction
between C8 alkyl chains on the nanoparticles. Studies are
ongoing to explain the behavior and characteristics of NP3, as we
are exploring its application in other technologies.

A summary
of results from the DLS experiments for each nanoparticle
in the presence of BSA is presented in Table 3 and corroborates our conclusions.

a Values are averaged
and standard
deviation of five measurements (mobility) or 10 measurements (radius).

The DLS measurement for the
mixtures (Figure 5)
was able to resolve free BSA in addition
to one or more NP populations. The sizes of the NP3 and NP1 population
are smaller than those measured in PBS, suggesting that the BSA coating
may inhibit or affect the nanoparticle aggregation. The data conclude
that the electrophoretic mobility of each nanoparticle-coated protein
is dominated by BSA and measurements for the nanoparticles are indistinguishable
from the BSA alone (Table 3).

with BSA.

CD Data
CD spectroscopy
was used to evaluate the conformational
changes of BSA and hUbq upon their interaction with variable concentrations
of nanoparticles. The CD spectra of BSA (Figure 6, left) and hUbq (Figure 6, right) were in the absence and presence
of NP1 and NP2, respectively.

Figure 6 CD spectra of nanoparticles while binding to
BSA (left) and hUbq
(right).

The CD spectrum of pure BSA exhibits
two negative minima at 208
and 222 nm and a positive maximum between 190 and 195 nm, indicative
of a protein-rich in α-helices.77 Changes in the intensities of these peaks are indicative of changes
in the α-helical structure.78 We
decided to focus our efforts and compared NP1 and NP2, as NP2 will
serve as a platform substrate for technologies developed in our laboratory.
We are particularly interested in conjugating molecules to NP2 for
various applications. However, it should be noted that NP3 did alter
the α-helical structure of BSA and UBQ, data unpublished.

The negative ellipticity for peaks at 208 and 209 nm increases
for BSA in the presence of each nanoparticle, indicating a decrease
in α-helical content. NP2 has a more profound effect on increasing
the negative ellipticity of each protein, meaning a stronger interaction.
Similar results were observed for binding to hUbq.

NMR Data
We completed 2D [15N–1H]-HSQC NMR
experiments to compare the interactions of NP1
and NP2 with 15N-ubiquitin and followed a similar protocol
described by Rossi et al. who used NMR to investigate ubiquitin-gold
nanoparticle interactions.61 Rossi et al.
reported the direct interaction of AuNPs with hUbq and observed small
perturbations in the chemical shifts of some amino acid peaks in the
[15N–1H] HSQC spectrum of 15N-ubiquitin upon addition of AuNPs, particularly, Q2, L15, and E18.
Illustrated in Figure 7 is an overlaid 2D [15N–1H]-HSQC NMR
spectrum of NP1/hUbq and NP2/hUbq and is done to demonstrate the differentiation
in the chemical shift perturbation profile of the two nanoparticles.
Our data confirm that each nanoparticle binds to unique regions of
hUbq (Figures S1 and S4). Our results are
similar to those reported by Rossi et al., whereby the majority of
the NH groups on the hUbq protein have small CSPs in the presence
of the nanoparticles. Albeit small CSPs were observed for both nanoparticles,
and it is apparent that there are differences in binding site interactions
for each nanoparticle. As reported by Rossi et al., Q2-I3 and L15-E18
form a domain on the hUbq protein surface that interacts with AuNPs
that are at the N-terminal end of the protein and are part of the
β-turn-β-motif.

Figure 7 Overlaid 2D HSQC NMR spectrum differentiating
the CSP of NP1/hUbq
(red) and NP2/hUbq (blue).

The CSPs of these three amino acids are lower for NP2 relative
to NP1, again concluding differential binding interactions between
the two nanoparticles with hUbq. An additional observation is that
the 2D [15N–1H] NMR HSQC experiments
revealed peaks for threonine (T12) and leucine (L73) only in the hUbq-NP1
NMR spectrum. As with Rossi et al., we were not able to calculate
a CSP for T12, but it is interesting to note the relative appearance
of these two peaks in the two spectra. Overall, the CSPs are very
small, indicating that the hUbq remains folded with a limited structural
change when interacting with each nanoparticle. Structural perturbations
are evident in our CD experiments, which suggest a decrease in the
α-helical content for hUbq in the presence of both NP1 and NP2.

Conclusions
In this study, we used various spectroscopic
techniques to characterize
the properties and behaviors of the three SERS-based nanoparticles
interacting with serum albumin (BSA) and ubiquitin (hUbq), proteins
that are known to be abundant in serum. We also compared the characteristics
of the nanoparticles under conditions of variable ionic strength mimicking
physiological conditions. Our findings for the behavior and characteristics
of NP1 (AuNP), in the presence of proteins and conditions of variable
ionic strength, are consistent with those reported in the literature.
AuNPs are known to undergo salt-induced aggregation and stabilization
in the presence of proteins.65,66

We observed that
NP3 (Au@SiO2-C8) naturally
aggregates and appears to have a low propensity to interact with BSA
and hUbq. The aggregation of NP3 is probably the result of its hydrophobic
coating, which removes surface adsorbed water from the nanoparticle’s
surface.79 We are interested in the dielectric
properties of NP3 and its application in optical and electrical technologies
and will report more on the physiochemical properties of NP3 in subsequent,
but in the context of a different application, dye-doped solar cells.

NP2 is stabilized under conditions of ionic strength and, in the
presence of proteins, does not form aggregates. NP2 (Au@SiO2) will serve as a platform for our research group to design other
SERS-based and hybrid nanoparticles for theranostic applications.
The Raman spectra of NP2 was recorded by Nie and Doering7 who reported an intense SERS spectrum for TRITC-tagged
gold nanoparticles resulting from the affinity of the isothiocyanate
group for the gold surface and the dyes with strong electronic transitions
in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. We will continue
to investigate NP2, particularly the optimal silica thickness and
other conditions needed to enhance its SERS signal. NP2 is more stable
under physiological conditions and will serve as a platform to design
nanoparticles for theranostic applications. In subsequent publications,
we will report thoroughly on the kinetics of NP2 in the presence of
various proteins and variable conditions of ionic strength.

Our use of 2D [15N–1H]-HSQC NMR experiments
to complete a side-by-side comparison of interactions of NP1 and NP2
with 15N-ubiquitin assisted in our understanding of nanoparticle–protein
interactions of each respective nanoparticle. Our data confirm that
each nanoparticle binds to unique regions of hUbq. The information
can be used to aid in understanding the formation of the protein corona
at the surface of the nanoparticle and the design of nanoparticles
with features increasing their ability to reach their intended biological
targets. The NMR data report that the nanoparticle–protein
interaction is transient. Additional research is needed to understand
the kinetics of nanoparticle–protein interactions, particularly
confirmation of these transient interactions. We propose to follow
up on this and use scattering correlation spectroscopy to characterize
protein adsorption at the nanoparticle surface. Using this technique,
we expect to get more insight into the adsorption behaviors of proteins
at the nanoparticle surface and uncover events that may be obscured
by ensemble averaging techniques.

Experimental Section
Materials
Synthesis
of Bare Gold Nanoparticles (AuNP, NP1)
Gold
nanoparticles were synthesized similar to methods described in the
literature.62,63 Briefly, 2 mL of freshly prepared
trisodium citrate aqueous solution (1% w/v) was added to 50 mL of
a 0.4 mM chloroauric acid trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) solution while boiling. This mixture was kept boiling for
30 min and thereafter cooled to room temperature. The gold nanoparticle
sizes were measured using TEM, and the concentration of nanoparticles
was adjusted to 12 nM using UV/vis absorption spectroscopy. A molar
extinction coefficient of 1 × 108 M–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the concentration of
the nanoparticles.64 Nanoparticle solutions
were stored at 4 °C until further use and herein referenced as
NP1.

Synthesis of Gold Hybrid Nanoparticles (Au@SiO2, NP2)
An aliquot of NP1 was subsequently labeled with fluorescent dye
tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate (5-TRITC), coated with a SiO2 layer, and herein referenced as NP2. Exactly, NP2 was prepared
by adding 50 μL of 100 μM aqueous TRITC solution to 20
mL of freshly prepared NP1 (12 nM) solution with constant stirring
for 30 min. Next, 200 μL (2 mM) of newly prepared 3-aminopropyl
trimethoxysilane (APTMS) aqueous solution was added. After continuous
stirring for 30 min, freshly prepared sodium silicate solution (1
mL, 0.54% w/v pH > 12) was added and stirred for another 10 min.
This
solution was allowed to stay undisturbed for 1 day upon which 20 mL
of ethanol was added and kept for another day to form a condensed
SiO2 layer. The entire solution was then purified by centrifugation
at 13,300 rpm and subsequently washed five times using anhydrous ethanol
and DI water producing Au-TRITC-SiO2 nanoparticles herein
referenced as Au@SiO2 or NP2. TEM images of NP1 and NP2
nanoparticles are presented in Figure 8, left and right, respectively. NP2 will serve as a
platform for us to design other nanoparticles of interest to our group.

Figure 8 STEM images
of NP1 (left) and NP2 (right).

Synthesis of Gold Hybrid Nanoparticles (Au@SiO2-C8, NP3)
A similar method was used to synthesize the
Au@SiO2-C8 nanoparticles except for replacing
APTMS with 2 mM freshly prepared trimethoxy(octyl)silane (TMOS) aqueous
solution. The replacement of APTMS with TMOS enabled us to coat the
nanoparticle with a silica surface having octyl (C8) groups
extending from the surface, changing the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticle
surface. Herein, this nanoparticle is referenced as NP3.

Spectroscopic
Characterization
We used various spectroscopic
techniques to characterize the properties and behaviors of the three
nanoparticles interacting with proteins known to be abundant in serum,
mainly serum albumin (BSA) and ubiquitin (hUbq). We also investigated
the characteristics of the nanoparticles under conditions of variable
ionic strength.

Ultraviolet/Visible Spectroscopy (UV/Vis)
Absorption
spectra of different nanoparticle–protein conjugates were collected
using a UV/vis absorption spectrophotometer, Varian (CARY 100 Bio),
scanning from 300 to 750 nm. A series of nanoparticle–protein
conjugates were made to give different ratios of protein/nanoparticles
while holding the nanoparticle concentration constant (∼1.4
nM). The NP-protein conjugate solutions were made by first mixing
aliquots of BSA stock solution into 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) to give variable
concentrations of protein solutions. Nanoparticles dissolved in 0.1
M PBS (pH 7.4) were subsequently added to the protein solution. The
solution was mixed and UV/vis spectra were recorded at room temperature.
Protein concentration varied from 0 to 720 nM.

Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)
Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) and phase analysis light scattering (PALS) data were collected
using the Mobius (Wyatt Technology). Data acquisition and analysis
were performed with DYNAMICS software (version 7.8, Wyatt).

For AuNP in water, neat nanoparticles (NP1) or nanoparticles diluted
1:10 (NP2 and NP3) were measured using the Mobius dip cell. PALS and
DLS data were collected simultaneously. Each measurement consisted
of 10 s of PALS data and three 5 s DLS acquisitions. Reported values
are average and standard deviation of five measurements.

For
AuNP in PBS or with BSA, measurements were performed in the
Mobius flow cell, pressurized by the Atlas (Wyatt). Phosphate-buffered
saline (25 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM NaCl) was filtered to 0.1 μm prior to
use. BSA (Fisher) was prepared at ∼10 mg/mL in filtered PBS
and filtered to 0.1 μm prior to use. For each measurement, AuNPs
were diluted 1:10 in filtered PBS or filtered BSA (final concentration,
∼140 μM BSA) and immediately injected into the Mobius.
The cell was pressurized and measurements were performed. Each measurement
cycle consisted of five DLS measurements in the absence of the electric
field (three 5 s acquisitions) followed by five simultaneous measurements
of PALS (5 s) and DLS data (three 5 s acquisitions). Performing the
DLS measurements first in the absence of the electric field established
a baseline size for each particle under each condition. Simultaneous
DLS and PALS measurements ensured that the electric field did not
cause aggregation or other size changes under these conditions. Reported
values were averaged and standard deviation calculated using ten measurements
for DLS data and five measurements for PALS data.

Ultraviolet
Circular Dichroism (UV-CD) Spectroscopy
Using a quartz cuvette
(1 mm path length), three consecutive far-UV
(190–260 nm) scans were made at a scan rate of 100 nm/min and
averaged using a JASCO J 815 spectrometer held at 37 °C. The
sample temperature was controlled using a circulation water system
and Peltier cooler. The CD spectra were corrected for background contributions
from the solvent (0.1 M PBS).

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was used to study the morphology and size of the
nanoparticles. The concentrations of the nanoparticle solutions were
about 12 nM. The nanoparticle solutions were dropped onto Formvar
carbon-coated copper grids (400-mesh) and incubated for 2 min. Excess
solution was removed by filter paper, and copper grids were air-dried
for 2 min. Finally, the samples were examined and photographed using
a Hitachi HT7800 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

NMR Spectroscopy
Preparation of samples for NMR analysis
was completed as accordingly. PBS (3 mL, 20 mM, pH 6.5) was added
to 5 mg of 15N-labeled Ubq to make a 196 μM ubiquitin
stock solution. The addition of nanoparticles was performed in NMR
tubes: 540 μL of H2O and 6 μL of D2O were added to 60 μL of the stock solution to produce a (19.4
μM) Ubq only sample. To prepare the NP1 sample, 540 μL
(12 nM) of NP1 and 6 μL of D2O were added to 60 μL of
the stock Ubq solution yielding a (19.4 μM) Ubq/10.7 nM NP1
solution. A similar procedure was carried out for the addition of
NP2 by adding 540 μL of 11.7 nM NP2 and 6 μL of D2O to 60 μL of Ubq yielding a concentration of 19.4 μM
Ubq/0.7 nM NP2 solution. Two-dimensional NMR 15N–1H HSQC experiments were performed with a 700 MHz Bruker NMR
instrument after 600 scans for each sample. Data were processed with
the same processing parameters for all samples using the TopSpin NMR
software. The hUbq HSQC NMR spectrum was overlaid with the Ubq/nanoparticle
HSQC NMR spectrum, and chemical shift values were derived for chemical
shift perturbation (CSP) analysis.
