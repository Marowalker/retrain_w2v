Electrochemical
oxidation has been considered as an efficient method to degrade pharmaceuticals
and personal care products. Maintaining low power consumption while
increasing the number of oxidation intermediates is deserving of exploring.
Herein, Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 was prepared by Zr doped into IrO2 and used
for Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation. The addition of Zr significantly
increased the electrochemically active area and facilitated the catalyst
to degrade SMX dramatically at a lower overpotential. The extremely
outstanding lifetime of catalysts can reach 800 h during the accelerated
life test, which showed excellent stability and developmental prospects.
The overpotential at 10 mA·cm–2 is about 329
mV, indicating that this electrode has a high oxygen evolution reaction
activity. Furthermore, the electrical efficiency per log order for
the electrode is only 8.50 kW h m–3 at 4 V. Our
research provides new anode electrochemical catalysts for the degradation
of organic pollutants.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recently,
pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been universally
detected in surface water and soil because of their persistence.1−3 The high consumption of PPCPs has caused harmful compounds to rapidly
residue in the environment, raising the risk of adverse health. Among
the PPCPs, the extensive use of antibiotics in human and animal diseases
makes them widely distributed in aquatic environments. Even low concentrations
of antibiotics can lead to the emergence of resistant bacteria, which
will seriously endanger the ecological environment and human health,
which has attracted more and more attention.4−7 Sulfamethoxazole (4-amino-N-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl)-benzenesulfonamide, SMX) is a
kind of sulfa antibiotics that are most widely used and have been
found in municipal sewage treatment plants, hospital effluents, surface
water, and even drinking water.8−10 SMX is resistant to biodegradation
and can remain in the environment for more than a year, posing a significant
potential threat to the environment.11,12 Therefore,
it is urgent to develop an efficient method to degrade SMX. Many studies
have explored the methods to remove SMX from aqueous solutions, including
Fenton, Ozonation, and photocatalysis.13−17 However, Ozonation can degrade SMX rapidly but cannot
achieve a high mineralization effect.14 Photochemical degradation can remove and mineralize SMX well, but
its operating conditions are very complicated and costly to implement.15

At present, electrochemical oxidation
is considered to be a feasible method to degrade PPCPs. Pollutants
can be degraded by losing electrons directly or indirectly at the
anode, and electrons are considered to be the most effective and environmentally
friendly antidotes. However, its development is limited by its high
cost and high energy consumption. These problems are related to anode
materials and can be solved by fabricating effective anodes.18 In recent years, “nonactive” anodes
including SnO2, BDD (boron-doped diamond), and PbO2 are studied for wastewater treatment for their high oxygen
evolution overpotential, which can produce a large number of oxidation
intermediates.19−21 Despite the advantages, their shortcomings are also
noticed. For example, the BDD electrode is only available in the laboratory
currently because of manufacturing difficulties and high cost. The
SnO2 electrode has a short life, and the PbO2 electrode may cause lead metal pollution. In general, “active”
anodes have good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity so that
they cannot degrade pollutants effectively. Nevertheless, there are
articles showing that the presence of OERs can also produce oxidation
intermediates.22 Compared to RuO2, IrO2 is considered as an excellent metal oxide anode
because of its high stability and electrocatalytic activity,23 but the high cost limits its application and
development.

In order to reduce the usage of Ir while maintaining
the lifetime of IrO2, doping other metal elements into
IrO2, such as Ta, Sn, Zr, to form composite materials is
a feasible way.24−26 Among these substances, ZrO2 has low thermal
conductivity, excellent chemical durability, and good thermal stability,
making it used well in catalysis and surface chemistry applications.27 At the same time, ZrO2 can stabilize
the crystallinity of IrO2 and promote more charge accumulation,
thus increasing OER activity.28 Besides,
adding interlayers can also improve the service life of the electrodes.29

In addition, enhancing the mass transfer
of pollutants can improve the degradation efficiency, and cross-flow
filtration is a good way to promote pollutants to contact the electrode
surface.30 Here, a filter-press reactor
and titanium foam with a three-dimensional porous structure were used
to enhance the mass transfer of the pollutant and enlarge pollutant
contact.

In this study, SnO2–Sb intermediate
layers were prepared on the titanium substrate by thermal decomposition
first. After that, active layers of different iridium zirconium molar
ratios were prepared by thermal decomposition. The electrochemical
activity was investigated by polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves, Tafel slopes, and electrochemical surface area (ECSA).
The electrode stability was investigated by the accelerated life test
(ALT). Furthermore, the effects of Zr content on the surface morphology
were investigated by physical characterization. Combining these factors,
Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 is the optimal electrode. The degradation effect of Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 was
also studied; then, we studied the influence of different degradation
conditions on the degradation of SMX. In the meantime, we analyzed
the energy consumption during degradation.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for catalysts with different
Ir/Zr mole ratios are shown in Figure 1a, it is evident that the diffraction planes of all
catalysts are similar. At the same time, no diffraction peaks corresponding
to ZrO2 were found, indicating that ZrO2 exists
as an amorphous phase, or Zr doped into the lattice of IrO2. This may be because zirconium concentration is too low to form
a metastable tetragonal form of ZrO2.31Figure 1b is the XRD patterns of Ti and Ti/SnO2–Sb. We
can see that there are no diffraction peaks corresponding to Sb. From
the EDS of Ti/SnO2–Sb (Figure 1c), we can clearly see Sb element peaks and
the mass fraction of Sb is only 1.32%. This is most likely due to
the low doping amount of Sb, which has entered the SnO2 lattice in a way of replacement or interstitial.32

Ti and Ti/SnO2–Sb. (c) EDS of Ti/SnO2–Sb. (d) Polarization curves of catalysts with different Ir/Zr
mole ratios. (e) Accelerated lifetime curve of catalysts with different
Ir/Zr mole ratios. (f) Accelerated lifetime curve of Ti/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 and Ti/IrO2.

The polarization curves are shown in Figure 1d. We can see that the catalysts have similar
polarization currents. With the increase of zirconium content, the
polarization current at the same pressure first increases and then
decreases. The potential of Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 at 10 mA·cm–2 is 1.558 V so the over potential is about 0.329 V, and the over
potential of Ti/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 is 0.346
V, indicating that Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 has a better OER activity. Meanwhile, from
the figure we can see that Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 is the catalyst which has the best
OER activity with different Ir/Zr mole ratios.

Dimensionally
stable anodes have a life span of several years in industrial applications,
and the ALT is an effective method to reduce the lifetime33 (Scheme S1). Electrode
stability was investigated by the ALT and is shown in Figure 1e,f. ALT is a standard index
to evaluate the life span of the electrode. From Figure 1c, we can see that the addition
of zirconium reduced the stability of the electrode to some extent.
However, the Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 electrode reduces the Ir usage by 30% but its lifetime
by 20% only. Hence, there is an advantage to doping ZrO2 to some degree. Figure 1f shows the effect of the intermediate layers on the electrode
life. It is obvious that the SnO2–Sb layers improve
the electrode stability. The reason may be that the intermediate layers
enhance the adhesion of the electrode, making the active layer more
difficult to peel off.29

The active
sites are exposed for catalysts with a porous or layered morphology.
Therefore, the surface area should be considered when comparing the
electrocatalytic capacity. The ECSA is proportional to OER performance
generally. Figure 2a shows the CV curve at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100
mV s–1) for catalysts with different Ir/Zr mole
ratios. The ECSA can be obtained by processing the charging current
of the double-layer capacitor at different scan rates (Scheme S1, Figure S1). Results of the ECSA are shown in Figure 2b. We can see that Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 has the highest ECSA, and
it is obvious that the result is consistent with the OER activity.
In a lot of studies,34 the Tafel slope
was used to compare the OER activity of the catalysts. As shown in Figure 2c, the Tafel data
of Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 was 65 mV·dec–1 and steeper than other
catalysts. The value of the Tafel slope is just one activity parameter
for OER activity; combined with the polarization curves, CV curves,
and the value of ECSA of this study, we find that Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 has the
best OER activity.

Figure 2 (a) CV curves at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80,
100 mV/s) for catalysts with different Ir/Zr mole ratios. (b) ECSA
for catalysts with different Ir/Zr mole ratios. (c) Tafel curves of
catalysts with different Ir/Zr mole ratios.

The morphologies of Ti/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 and
Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 are obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 3a,b shows that the
IrO2 crystal prepared by thermal decomposition at 450 °C
has been completely formed, and a few cracks appear on the surface,
which can increase the specific surface area of the electrode, at
the same time improving OER activity. By comparing Figure 3a–c, we can find that
the addition of Zr causes the crystal of IrO2 to stick
closer together to form a strip form. The formation of strips makes
the surface more gully, increasing the specific surface area. On the
other hand, it makes the anode surface more unstable and the life
of the anode is reduced.

Figure 4 shows the CV curves of Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 and Ti/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 in different solutions. We can see that the addition of SMX
has little effect on the CV curves, and there is no new reduction
peak or oxidation peak. This shows that there is no direct electron
transfer between SMX and the electrode in the electrochemical reaction;,
then SMX is degraded by indirect electrochemical oxidation.35

of Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2. (b) Comparison of the CV curves in different solutions of
Ti/SnO2–Sb/IrO2.

2.2 Degradation of SMX
In order to prove that
the degradation of SMX is the function of catalyst layers, the Ti-foam
electrode without the catalyst was used as a control group; Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 was also used as a control group
to study its degradation of SMX and compared to the Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 electrode.

As shown in Figure 5a, the Ti-f electrode has about 10% SMX removal, almost negligible.
Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 has nearly 100% SMX
removal, the same as the Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 electrode. This may be because the
two kinds of electrodes prepared by thermal decomposition have little
difference in material structure and electrochemical activity. Figure 2b shows that Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 has
a high active area, which is conducive to the adsorption of pollutants.
The oxidizing intermediates generated by the OER process are more
likely to be in contact with the pollutants, reinforcing the SMX degradation
effect.

(c) SMX degradation under different currents. (d) SMX degradation

different electrolyte concentrations. (f) SMX degradation under different
electrolytes.

In a study on the degradation
under different conditions in the following, the anode used is the
Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 electrode.

2.3 Degradation under Different
Conditions
Energy consumption is one of the most important
indicators to the application prospect of electrochemical degradation,
and the applied voltage directly determines the energy consumption
values. Therefore, we investigate different applied voltages including
3, 4, 6, and 8 V. As shown in Figure 5b, SMX removal increases as the voltage increases and
SMX could be degraded completely after 4 h when the voltage is more
than 4 V. Generally, in the application of the electrochemical industry,
the voltage needs to reach 10 V. In this experiment, 4 V can even
achieve a good SMX removal, which greatly reduces energy consumption
and the effect of high voltage on electrode life.

Current density
is one of the critical factors to determine electrochemical degradation
efficiency. Hence, the influence of different currents is also explored.
We investigate different currents varying from 20 to 400 mA. The same
electrode was used as the anode in the experiment to study the effect
of current on degradation, so the current density is proportional
to the current. As shown in Figure 5c, we found that the increase of current can enhance
the removal of SMX, but not obviously; the reason may be limited mass
transfer rate from SMX to the anode, and the increased inside reaction,
so excessive current density leads to lower energy efficiency.36,37 COD removal after 4 h was measured to calculate the current efficiency
(CE). We can see that it is evident that the increase in current has
a positive effect on the removal of COD but has an adverse effect
on CE in Figure S2. Compared to the increase
on COD removal, the decrease in CE is not much, so 400 mA is a better
choice.

The influence of different initial SMX concentrations
should also be considered during the degradation process. We investigate
different initial SMX concentrations including 20, 40, 60, 80, and
100 ppm. As shown in Figure 5d, SMX can be degraded at different concentrations with removal
higher than 95%. Meanwhile, compared with high-concentration SMX,
low-concentration SMX is more easily degraded quickly. The reason36 may be that the amount of activated oxygen substance
produced under a certain voltage is the same; the lower the initial
SMX concentration, the more likely it is to be attacked by the active
substance.

Virtually all actual wastewater contains different
degrees of salt, so the influence of electrolyte concentration should
be explored. Na2SO4 is the supporting electrolyte,
and we investigate different Na2SO4 concentrations
including 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mol/L. As shown in Figure 5e, we can find that the increase
in Na2SO4 concentration has a good effect on
SMX decomposition, and 100% removal could be achieved at all varying
Na2SO4 concentrations. The main reason is that
an increase in salt concentration enhances the conductivity of the
solution and then promotes electron exchange.

In addition, different
electrolytes, including 0.1 mol/L H2SO4, 0.1
mol/L Na2SO4, and 0.1 mol/L NaOH, were used
to study the influence on SMX removal. As shown in Figure 5f, it is evident that the best
degradation effect is in 0.1 M H2SO4, indicating
that the oxidation process of SMX is better under acidic conditions,
probably because the change in pH would affect the species and hydration
of the molecules, then affecting the proliferation of SMX.37

2.4 Role of Titanium Foam
Figure 6a,b shows
the SEM images of Ti and Ti foam. It can be clearly seen that the
surface of the titanium plate is rough after etching. The same is
true for the surface and the internal parts of titanium foam. The
difference between titanium plate and titanium foam is mainly the
irregular pores of titanium foam, which form a three-dimensional porous
structure. From Figure 6c,d, we can see that the strip-shaped and granular catalysts on the
Ti foam are distributed on the surface and in the pore channels, and
they are more compactly distributed compared to the titanium plate.
The three-dimensional structure of Ti foam dramatically increases
the surface area of the catalysts and improves the electrocatalytic
activity of the electrode, as shown in Figure 6e.

Figure 6 (a) SEM images of the Ti plate with magnification
of 200 times. (b) SEM images of Ti foam with magnification of 200
times. (c) SEM images of Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 with magnification of 1000 times. (d)
SEM images of Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/IrO2 with
magnification of 5000 times. (e) Polarization curves of Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 and
Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2. (f) Vomparison of SMX degradation with different substrates.

In order to understand the role of Ti foam substrates
in degradation, we compared SMX degradation between the Ti plate electrode
and the Ti foam porous electrode under the same catalyst. During degradation,
the electrolyte was 0.20 mol/L Na2SO4, the voltage
was 4 V, and the initial concentration of SMX in 150 mL electrolyte
was about 20 ppm. From Figure 6f, it is clear that the Ti foam electrode has a higher removal
effect than the Ti electrode. This shows that the three-dimensional
porous Ti foam can greatly improve the mass transfer efficiency of
pollution and provide a large specific surface, which increases the
possibility of contact between SMX molecules and catalysts and greatly
improves the degradation effect.38 Therefore,
this foam substrate has a very high application prospect in electrochemical
degradation of pollutants.

2.5 Energy Consumption
In addition to the SMX degradation performance, energy consumption
is closely related to the application prospect of electrochemical
degradation. It is well known that BDD and PbO2 electrodes
are effective in removing pollutants by electrochemical degradation,
same as SMX degradation.19,21 However, the degradation
of pollutants requires a specific current, which means a high overpotential
because of their inert OER activity.39 From
the polarization curves, Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 shows outstanding OER performance.
Under 1.6 V (E/v vs RHE), the current
can even reach over 10 mA·cm–2, whereas the
current of the BDD and PbO2 electrode is much lower under
the same conditions. Thus, excellent OER performance of Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 allows
it to degrade pollutants by applying a lower anode potential and reduce
energy consumption.

In this study, the energy consumption is
described by the EE/O (electrical efficiency per log order). EE/O
is defined as the electricity consumed by reducing the concentration
of pollutants by order of magnitude. The values of EE/O can be calculated
from eq 1 where P is the output power (kW h), t is the
degradation time (h), V is the volume of wastewater
(m3), c0 is the initial SMX
concentrations (mg/L), and ct is the final SMX concentrations (mg/L). 1  

Table 1 shows the values of EE/O determined for different
voltages, and it can be observed that the value of EE/O increases
with the increase of voltage, and the increase in 4–6 V was
particularly pronounced. Figure 5b shows the SMX removal at different voltages. As shown
in the graph, the SMX degradation is basically complete when the voltage
is higher than 4 V after 4 h of degradation. Combined with Table 1, a good SMX removal
and low energy consumption can be achieved at a voltage of 4 V.

EE/O (kW h m–3)	3.20	8.50	32.0	69.3	
3 Conclusions
In summary, Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 prepared by the thermal decomposition method
can efficiently reduce the amount of Ir to 70%. In the meantime, its
lifetime was reduced by less than 20%, and SnO2–Sb
as intermediate layers can improve the electrode stability. Through
electrochemical analysis, we can find that Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 had high OER activity and
a sizeable active surface area. Besides, we used this electrode for
the removal of SMX and found that it can effectively remove SMX under
a low voltage. Different conditions (different voltages, currents,
initial SMX concentrations, electrolyte concentrations, and electrolytes)
can also affect the degradation effect, and 20 ppm of SMX can be 100%
removed in 0.2 M Na2SO4 (under 4 V) after 4
h. Meanwhile, the COD removal reached 28%, and the EE/O value was
only about 8.50 kW h m–3. In conclusion, Ti/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 is
an excellent anode material for the degradation of organic pollutants.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
C10H11N3O3S (CAS: 723-46-6)
was purchased from TCI (Tokyo, Japan), H2IrCl6·xH2O (Ir ≥ 36%, CAS: 110802-84-1)
and Na2SO4 (purity level ≥99%, CAS: 7757-82-6)
were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China), whereas ZrCl4 (CAS: 10026-11-6) was purchased from J&K Scientific (Beijing,
China). All chemical reagents and solvents used here were of reagent
grade and could be used directly without further purification.

4.2 Electrode Preparation
4.2.1 Pretreatment of the Ti
Substrate
In this study, a titanium plate (5 mm × 15
mm) was used for catalyst loading. The pretreatment of the Ti plate
is shown as follows. First, the Ti plate was heated at 90 °C
in 40% NaOH solution for an hour to remove surface oil. Then, the
Ti plate was etched at 90 °C in 10% oxalic acid solution for
2 h to produce a surface with uniform roughness. The titanium foam
(25 × 25 mm) used for pollutant degradation also had the same
processing steps as described above.

4.2.2 Preparation
of the Anode
Intermediate layers were coated before applying
the active catalyst. This experiment used SnO2–Sb
as intermediate layers and the intermediate layer solution was prepared
by the sol–gel method.40 Brush-coating
was used for applying intermediate layers to the Ti plate, then drying
in oven at 60 °C for 10 min, and annealing in a muffle furnace
at 500 °C for 15 min. The steps were repeated 10 times and the
last time of annealing was for 1 h.

In this study, conventional
thermal decomposition was used to prepare active layers. H2IrCl6·xH2O and ZrCl4 were dissolved in 1/1 v/v hydrochloric acid/deionized water,
respectively; the concentration of both solvents was 1 mol/L. The
precursors were prepared by mixing the two solutions with volume ratios
of 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 5:5(ZrxIr1–xO2, x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5), respectively, followed by 30 min of sonication to ensure the
ink is well-mixed. The homogeneous ink (3.5 μL) was coated on
the Ti plate, which was coated with intermediate layers, then dried
in an oven at 100 °C for 5 min, and annealing in a muffle furnace
at 450 °C for 10 min. The steps were repeated 10 times and the
last time of annealing was for 1 h.

The preparation of Ti foam
used for SMX degradation is shown as follows. The coating of intermediate
layers was the same as Ti plate, whereas the impregnation method was
used to prepare the active layer. The ink used in the titanium plate
was diluted three times with 1/1 v/v hydrochloric acid/deionized water
to form a new ink and sonicated for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink.
Ti foam was impregnated into this ink solution for 1 min, and then
it was taken out of the ink for drying in an oven at 100 °C for
10 min and annealed in s muffle furnace 450 °C for 10 min. This
was repeated several times until 1.8 mL ink was used up and the last
time of annealing was for 1 h.

4.3 Characterization
of the Catalyst
The crystal structure was investigated by
power XRD D/max2550VB with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ
= 1.5406 Å). SEM was used to observe the morphologies of the
catalysts.

All the electrochemical measurements were done in
three electrode cells equipped with the KCl saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) as the reference electrode and a Pt plate dimensionally of 1
× 1 cm as the counter electrode. Perchloric acid solution (0.1
mol/L) was chosen as the electrolyte. CV curves were taken at 10–100
mV/s between −0.2 and 1.2 V (E/v vs SCE) after 20 cycles. EIS measurement was measured at 1.25 V
(E/v vs SCE) with frequency ac impedance
(1 Hz to 1000 kHz). More details on measuring and calculating the
Tafel slope and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) are presented
in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1,
Figure S1).

The ALT was taken in galvanostatical electrolysis
at 2.5 A·cm–2 in 1 M H2SO4 solution, at the temperature of 60 °C with a water bath. The
Ti plate (10 mm × 30 mm) was taken as the counter electrode.
When the potential of the cell increased for 5 V, the ALT was taken
to be the end.

4.4 Degradation Experiments
Electrochemical degradation experiments were accomplished in a
filter-press reactor. Before electrolyzing, the solution should be
circulated for more than 2 h to eliminate the effect of adsorption.
The anode was Ti foam/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 (Ti-f/SnO2–Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2) and Ti foam/IrO2 (Ti-f/IrO2), and the total mass loading was 8.4 and 12 mg Ir whose dimension
is 6.25 cm2, respectively, whereas the counter electrode
is used as a stainless steel of 100 meshes with a size of 4 cm round.
The distance between the cathode and the anode was about 1 cm. The
total volume of the solution was 150 mL and the speed of the peristaltic
pump was 70 rpm. The electrolysis time was 4 h; taking a sample every
30 min, each sampling volume was 1.0–1.2 mL. The degradation
process was conducted under different currents, different electrolyte
concentrations, different initial SMX concentrations, different voltages,
and different electrolytes. In addition to the altered degradation
conditions, the electrolyte is 0.20 mol/L Na2SO4, the voltage is 4 V, and the initial concentration of SMX is about
20 ppm in 150 mL of electrolyte.

4.5 Analytical
Methods
During this experiment, the concentration of SMX
was determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
system (Shimadzu Prominence LC-20A HPLC, Japan), which was equipped
with an Inertsil ODS-SP column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm).
The mobile phase was Milli-Q water and methanol (60:40, v/v) and the
flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The degree of oxidation of SMX during the
experiments was determined by COD (chemical oxygen demand) measured
by a chemical oxygen demand analyzer.
