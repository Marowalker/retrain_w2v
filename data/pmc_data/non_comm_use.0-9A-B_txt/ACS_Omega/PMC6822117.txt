In
this article, we perform density functional theory calculation
to investigate the electronic and optical properties of newly reported
In3–xSe4 compound using
CAmbridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). Structural parameters
obtained from the calculations agree well with the available experimental
data, indicating their stability. In the band structure of In3–xSe4 (x = 0, 0.11, and, 0.22), the Fermi level (EF) crossed over several bands in the conduction bands, which is an
indication of the n-type metal-like behavior of In3–xSe4 compounds. On the other hand, the
band structure of In3–xSe4 (x = 1/3) exhibits semiconducting nature with a
band gap of ∼0.2 eV. A strong hybridization among Se 4s, Se
4p and In 5s, In 5p orbitals for In3Se4 and
that between Se 4p and In 5p orbitals were seen for β-In2Se3 compound. The dispersion of In 5s, In 5p and
Se 4s, Se 4p orbitals is responsible for the electrical conductivity
of In3Se4 that is confirmed from DOS calculations
as well. Moreover, the bonding natures of In3–xSe4 materials have been discussed based
on the electronic charge density map. Electron-like Fermi surface
in In3Se4 ensures the single-band nature of
the compound. The efficiency of the In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells has been calculated
by Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS)-1D software using experimental
data of In3–xSe4 thin
films. The effect of various physical parameters on the photovoltaic
performance of In3–xSe4/p-Si solar cells has been investigated to obtain the highest efficiency
of the solar cells. The optimized power conversion efficiency of the
solar cell is found to be 22.63% with VOC = 0.703 V, JSC = 38.53 mA/cm2, and FF = 83.48%. These entire theoretical predictions indicate
the promising applications of In3–xSe4 two-dimensional compound to harness solar energy in
near future.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
the renewable energy sources are taking place over world’s
finite dominant energy sources (oil, coal, uranium) to meet up the
increasing demand of power supply. The need for inexpensive and large-scale,
carbon-neutral energy sources has stimulated a search for revolutionary
concepts in solar-to-electricity energy conversion. The silicon solar
cell covers over 90% of the global market, although it has an indirect
band gap with weak light absorption and extreme processing temperature
of ∼1400 °C.1 Researchers are
focusing on making alternative efficient and cheap solar cells.

Recently, silicon/organic hybrid solar cells have gained extensive
research interest as they are promising to combine the benefits of
organic materials being cheap and easy to process and inorganic materials
possessing better charge carrier mobilities and low exciton binding
energies.2−5 A number of promising heterojunction solar cells have been demonstrated
based on this type of architecture, such as devices that use Si in
conjunction with conjugated polymers. Specifically, the comprehensive
studies on conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
to modify its properties, texturing of silicon, and interface engineering
between Si/cathode have led to remarkable progress in efficiency (power
conversion efficiency, PCE) of 12–15.9%.7−11

In addition, it is advantageous to use p-type
Si compared to n-type
one due to its low cost. The photogenerated carriers can be effectively
collected using p-type silicon as minority carrier diffusion length
is larger in p-type silicon than that in n-type silicon. This phenomenon
provides low recombination rates, enhanced photocurrent, and improved
solar cell performance when p-type silicon is used.12 However, proper n-type organic materials have not been
founded yet that can be combined with p-type Si for efficient device
performance. So far, C60 and its derivatives have been
studied as candidates as n-type acceptors for use in Si/organic heterojunction
solar cells with p-type Si without providing high power, although
they displayed outstanding dark rectifying effect.13−17 Most recently, Yun et al. have reported this type
of solar cells with an efficiency of about 8.43% using thermal evaporation
of C60.12

In recent years,
metal chalcogenide-based n-Si heterojunction solar
cells have been reported.18−20 More recently, CdS/p-Si heterojunction
solar cells have also been reported with an efficiency of 12.29%.21 Furthermore, n-InSe/p-Si heterojunction solar
cells have been demonstrated as a promising structure to harness solar
energy, although they show a very low efficiency due to high interfacial
defects.22 Moreover, it is also reported
that chalcogenide thin films can be fabricated by low-cost solution
process, which indicates their potential in future solution-processed
chalcogenide/c-Si heterojunction solar cell applications.23−25 Indium selenide (InSe) is a III–VI two-dimensional (2D) compound
semiconductor composed of stacking of Se–In–In–Se
atoms bonded with van der Waals force between quadruple layers.26,27 The In–Se system can exist in many phases such as InSe, In2Se, In2Se3, In4Se3, and In6Se7.22 There
are some reports showing that the In–Se system can also exist
in the In3Se4 phase.28−31 The study of InSe thin films
is motivated by the potential applications in photovoltaic (PV) cells,32,33 solid-state batteries,34 phase-change
memories,35 nanoelectronics,36 optoelectronic devices,37,38 field-effect transistors,37 and thermoelectric
power conversion.39,40

However, the use of n-type
InSe with p-type Si to make solar cells
has several drawbacks such as high series resistance and high defect
density at the junction interface.22 Thus,
a common thread in this system is the trade-off between efficient
light absorption and charge collection. Charge can be effectively
collected when highly conducting InSe electron transport layer can
be used. It has already been reported that InSe provides a very high
electron mobility37 and also high conductivity.28−31 Now, it is required to make InSe thin films with high mobility as
well as high conductivity. This will make a pn junction with p-Si
as well as effectively transport electron to cathode. To overcome
this practical limit, new material synthesis approaches are needed.
Although In3Se4 has been synthesized and few
physical properties have been reported by some researchers, the electronic
and optical properties of this material are yet to be revealed.28−30 There is also a report unveiling that highly insulating β-In2Se3 encounters a transition to metallic In3Se4 phase.31

In
this article, we demonstrate the electronic structure of newly
reported In3–xSe4 2D
compound by first-principles study and its potential as an electron
transport window layer for the chalcogenide/p-Si heterojunction solar
cells as there are much scope for additional investigations to realize
high power conversion efficiency of In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Properties of
In3–xSe4 Compound
The optimization
of lattice constants and atomic positions of In3–xSe4 compound as a function of normal stress
with minimum total energy has been performed by density functional
theory (DFT) calculation using CAmbridge Serial Total Energy Package
(CASTEP) code. The optimized crystal structure of the In3–xSe4 (x = 1/3, 0) compound
is depicted in Figure 1 as unit cell and 2D view in the ab plane. The rhombohedral crystal
structure with space group R3̅m (#166) of In3–xSe4 compound has already been confirmed by experimental studies. The
calculated ground-state lattice constants are listed in Table 1. These calculated values agree
well with the reported experimental results.29,41

The rhombohedral structure (space group R3̅m) of β-In2Se3 has 15 lattice
sites comprising the six In atoms forming trigonal pyramidal cages
with three Se neighbors (Figure 1a), whereas the In3Se4 structure
has 21 lattice sites comprising the nine In atom sites forming octahedral
cages with six Se neighbors and 12 Se atom sites forming trigonal
pyramidal cages with three In neighbors (Figure 1b). The bond lengths in the octahedral (In–Se)
and trigonal pyramidal (Se–In) planes for In3Se4 structure are 2.61843 and 2.84135 Å, respectively. In
contrast, the only trigonal pyramidal bond (In–Se) length of
2.66773 Å is observed for the β-In2Se3 phase.

However, it is suitable to denote the unit cell as
3(R3–xVxX4), where
V is considered as vacancy in In atoms. For R2X3 compounds, 3/3 sites of the nine In sites per unit cell are empty,
i.e., x = 1/3, and for the R3X4 phases, there are no empty sites, i.e., x = 0.
The ionic behavior of the In3–xSe4 lattice can be formulated as (In3+)3–xVx(Se2–)4(e–1)1–3×.42 In β-In2Se3, the two In3+ ions provide six electrons
to the chemical bonding, which are captured by the 3 Se2– ions. Therefore, there are no excess electrons for the electrical
conduction, resulting in highly insulating In2Se3 compound. On the other hand, in the In3Se4 phase, nine bonding electrons are provided by the three In3+ ions, eight of which are captured by four Se–2 ions, resulting in an excess of one electron to the conduction band
per formula unit and three free electrons per unit cell.

The
carrier concentration of In3–xSe4 phase is given by42 1  where NA denotes
Avogadro’s number, d represents the density,
and M denotes the molecular weight.

Mass density d can be calculated by 2  where Z is the formula unit, NA is Avogadro’s number, M is the molecular
weight, and V is the volume.

The reported43 and calculated values
of d for the In3Se4 phase are
6.11 and 6.6 g/cm3, respectively.

Thus, the stoichiometric
In3–xSe4 compound (with x = 0) gains a free-electron
concentration of 6.01 × 1021 cm–3. The appearance of x vacancies provides (1 –
3x) electrons in the conduction band. Therefore,
during the transition from β-In2Se3 to
In3Se4 phase, there is a metallic transition
as the empty sites are filled with In ions providing excess electrons.
The carrier concentrations for different values of x are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting
Information.

The carrier can also be calculated theoretically
by the formula 3  where V is the volume of
the unit cell in cm3, as shown in Table 1, and coefficient 3 is introduced due the
fact that every unit cell provides three free electrons to the In3Se4 system. Using this formula, the carrier concentration
is found to be 6.01 × 1021 cm–3 similar
to the value obtained from eq 1, which agrees well with the reported values.31

2.2 Band Structure of In3–xSe4 Compound
The electronic properties
of a compound are revealed by the band structure, partial density
of states (PDOS), and total density of state (TDOS), which are also
closely related to charge density distribution and Fermi surface.44 The results of band structure calculations along
the high-symmetry directions within the Brillouin zone for In3–xSe4 are presented in Figure 2a–d. The horizontal
dashed line is the signature of Fermi level, EF, while the valence and conduction bands are indicated by
blue and red, respectively. Figure 2a depicts a clear gap between valence and conduction
bands for the In3–xSe4 compound for x = 1/3. The valence band maxima occurs
at Γ point, whereas the conduction band minima occurs at M point, so there exhibits an indirect band gap of Eg ∼ 0.2 eV. On the other hand, it is
seen from Figure 2b–d
that with x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0, the Fermi level
(EF) shifted to the conduction band is
an implication of their metal-like n-type conductivity. However, this
phenomenon might be rare but can happen due to the doping effect of
In, which generates additional free electrons, and consequently, EF cuts the conduction band showing degeneracy
of these materials.45

Figure 2 Electronic band structure
of In3–xSe4 compound
for different (x)
values: x = 1/3 (a), x = 0.22 (b), x = 0.11 (c), and x = 0 (d).

The band structure and band gap of In3–xSe4 were calculated by the software CASTEP
as shown
in the figures using localized density approximation (LDA) function
yielding a band gap of β-In2Se3 phase
of about 0.2 eV, whereas the experimental band gap is reported to
be 1.55 eV.46 This happens as the LDA function
consistently underestimates the band gap.47 The optical band gap is normally calculated using hybrid functional
HSE06 function based on DFT for accurate value, although it is reported
that DFT-based hybrid functional cannot always give exact band gaps
of the materials found in the experiments.48,49 However, HSE06 function was not performed in this study due to system
limitations. The crystal structure of In3Se4 is similar to that of the β-In2Se3 phase,
as reported another work.29 The relative
shifts in EF to those of the β-In2Se3 phase are 1.06, 1.10, and 1.62 eV for the x values of 0.22, 0.11, and 0, respectively, in In3–xSe4 compounds, as shown in Figure 2b–d. The optical band
gap of the nonstoichiometric In3Se4 thin films
is reported to be ∼1.8 eV with metallic conductivity.31 Therefore, from these figures, it can be concluded
that the optical band gap of stoichiometric In3Se4 phase should not be less than 1.62 eV, consistent with the report
as Fermi level must cross the conduction band for indicating high
degeneracy of the phase.31,45,50 These results indicate that when β-In2Se3 encounters a transformation to the In3Se4 phase,
optical band gap and conductivity increase similar to the case of
rare-earth chalcogenide thin films from Ce2S3 to Ce3S4.42,51,52

TDOS and PDOS are calculated and depicted in Figure 3a–d to exhibit
the contributions of
various orbitals/atoms and nature of chemical bonding in the In3–xSe4 compound. The structural
instabilities are indicated by the sharp peak of the DOS at EF; on the other hand, a deep and broad valley
of DOS might be liable for the structural stability. Consequently,
the overall DOS profile of these compounds unveils the structural
stability. It is seen that for x = 1/3, the TDOS
around EF arises mostly from Se 4p with
a little contribution from In 5p (Figure 3a), but for x = 0.22, 0.11,
and 0, TDOS originates from In 5s, In 5p, and Se 4s, Se 4p, respectively
(Figure 3b–d).
Therefore, there is strong hybridization between Se 4p and In 5p for x = 1/3 and In 5s, In 5p and Se 4s, Se 4p for x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0, respectively. Thus, a strong binary In–Se
covalent bond in In3–xSe4 results owing to these strong hybridizations. Remarkably, the value
of TDOS of In3–xSe4 at EF is found to be 7.83, 5.77, 5.79, and 5.63
states/eV/unit cells for x = 1/3, 0.22, 0.11, and
0, respectively. Therefore, it is clearly seen from the band structure
and DOS that the effect of varying composition of In for x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0 is relatively same apart from x = 1/3.

for different (x) values: x = 1/3
(a), x = 0.22 (b), x = 0.11 (c),
and x = 0 (d).

2.4 Fermi Surface of In3–xSe4 Compound
The Fermi surface topologies
of In3–xSe4 for x = 1/3, 0.22, 0.11, and 0 are shown in Figure 4a–d for the bands crossing
the EF. The Fermi surface topologies of
In3–xSe4 for x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0 are almost similar, but no Fermi surface
was found in the case of x = 1/3 for its insulating
nature (Figure 4a).
For x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0, as shown in Figure 4b–d, three central sheets
are the electron-like sheets with spherical cross section centered
along the A–G direction of
the Brillouin zone. A star-shaped sheet is also surrounding the central
sheets. Far from the central sheets, three distinguished middle-sagged
U-shaped close sheets are observed along the G–M direction and expanded along the M–L direction in the same sheet as well. The surfaces also
include two V-shaped holelike sheets centered at the corners of the
Brillouin zone along the G–K direction, which are further expanded along the K–H direction. However, these Fermi surfaces
are predominantly constructed due to the dispersion of In 5s, In 5p
and Se 4s, Se 4p orbitals resulting in the higher electrical conductivity
of the compounds that can also be ensured from DOS (Figure 3b–d).

(x) values: x = 1/3 (a), x = 0.22 (b), x = 0.11 (c), and x = 0 (d).

2.5 Electron
Charge Density Map of In3–xSe4 Compound
Figure 5a–d shows the valence
electronic charge density maps (in the units of e/Å3), which delineate the distribution of the total electronic charge
density of In3–xSe4 materials.
The right-hand-side scale represents the intensity of the electron
concentration. Low concentration of electrons is presented by blue,
whereas high concentration of electrons is presented by red. It is
seen from Figure 5b–d
that the distribution of charge is mainly spherical around all of
the atoms for In3–xSe4 (x = 0, 0.11, and 0.22) compounds under this study,
thereby showing the ionic nature. The ionic nature is an effect of
metallic characteristics,53 which indicates
that In–Se bonds in the aforementioned compositions manifest
metallic nature. Thus, a strong isotropic combination of ionic and
metallic interactions stands for In3–xSe4 compounds. On the other hand, for x = 1/3 (β-In2Se3) compound, the electronic
charge density of In/Se atoms shows potential overlapping of charge
and they are not perfectly spherical rather somewhat zigzag in shape.
This nonideal shape of atoms and their potential overlapping are an
indication of covalent bonding nature of the materials.

Figure 5 Electronic
charge density of In3–xSe4 compound for different (x)
values: x = 1/3 (a), x = 0.22 (b), x = 0.11 (c), and x = 0 (d).

This covalent nature might also be correlated to the insulating
property of the β-In2Se3 material, as
seen from the electronic properties calculations (Figure 3).

2.6 Optical
Properties of In3–xSe4 Compound
The optical properties
of a material are determined by a number of parameters such as dielectric
function, refractive index, loss function, conductivity, reflectivity,
and absorption coefficient, which completely depend on the energy
of the incident electromagnetic radiation.45

The frequency-dependent optical properties of In3–xSe4 are investigated, where various the
optical parameters fairly agree with the characteristic features of
the electronic properties. Both the electronic band structure and
optical conductivity reveal strong metal-like conductivity for the
In3–xSe4 (x = 0, 0.11, and 0.22) compound.

Figure 6a shows
the calculated spectra of the dielectric function of In3–xSe4. The dielectric constant at zero frequency
is known as the static dielectric constant. The static dielectric
constant of In3–xSe4 is found to be 16.93, 30.81, 30.35, and 30.72, respectively, for x = 1/3, 0.22, 0.11, and 0.

Figure 6 Energy-dependent dielectric function (a),
refractive index (n, k) (b), optical
conductivity (σ)
(c), absorption (α) (d), reflectivity (R) (e),
and loss function (L) (f) of the In3–xSe4 compound.

The calculated refractive index values n(0) of
In3–xSe4 for x = 1/3, 0.22, 0.11, and 0 are 4.11, 5.57, 5.52, and 5.56,
respectively, as shown in Figure 6b. The refractive index varies with the applied energy,
revealing that the In3–xSe4 compound has the photorefractive effect.

The optical
conductivity (σ) spectrum of In3–xSe4 is shown in Figure 6c. The maximum photoconductivity for this
compound is 6.43 found at 4.16 eV for x = 1/3 and
∼6 found at 3.75 eV for x = 0.22, 0.11, and
0.

Figure 6d
illustrates
the absorption spectra of In3–xSe4. Normally, the low-energy infrared part of the spectra
originated by the intraband transition. On the other hand, the interband
transition may contribute to the appearance of the peaks in the high-energy
region of the absorption and conductivity spectra. Notably, it is
observed in Figure 6c that the change in the conductivity spectra is identical to that
in the absorption spectra. Therefore, we may conclude that the photoconductivity
of the In3–xSe4 compound
rises as a result of photon absorption.

The reflectivity (R) spectra of In3–xSe4 are displayed in Figure 6e. A higher reflectivity is
seen in the infrared region approximately 37% for x = 1/3 and 48% for x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0 of the
total radiation, and in the high-energy region, some peaks arise due
to interband transition. However, the high reflectivity spectra of
this material indicate that it could be used as a promising coating
material to diminish solar heating. The high value of reflectivity
in the low-energy region reveals the characteristics of high conductance
in the low-energy region.54

The energy
loss spectra (L) of In3–xSe4 are exhibited in Figure 6f. The energy loss function
is a significant index to express the loss of energy of a fast moving
electron when it goes through a material.55 In the graph of loss function, the highest peak is related to the
plasma resonance and its associated frequency is called plasma frequency,
ωp.56 The highest peak
is observed at about 15.97 eV for x = 1/3 and 16.34
eV for x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0, which reveal the plasma
frequency of compounds. The In3–xSe4 compounds become transparent when the incident light
frequency is higher than the plasma frequency.

Figure 6a–f
shows that all of the curves of In3–xSe4 for x = 0.22, 0.11, and 0 overlap
with each other, which means there is no change of optical properties
at those compositions but showing a different picture for x = 1/3.

2.7 In3–xSe4/p-Si Heterojunction Solar Cells
Figure 7a,b delineates
the schematic
structure and energy band diagram of In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cell, respectively.
In In3–xSe4, the Fermi
energy (EF) and electron affinity of indium
selenide are about ∼4.4 and 4.55 eV, respectively.31,57 Therefore, Fermi level will reside within the conduction band in
In3–xSe4. On the other
hand, the electron affinity of Si is ∼4.05 eV. As a result,
In3–xSe4 builds a favorable
junction with Si, as schematically depicted in Figure 7b. Moreover, it has also been reported that
the band gap as well as the conductivity of the chalcogenides can
be modulated using electron beam irradiation, which may also play
an important role in the formation of favorable chalcogenide/p-Si
heterojunction for the photovoltaic (PV) applications.58

2.7.1 Thickness- and Doping
Concentration-Dependent
PV Performance
The simulated J–V curves of the In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells with the variation
of thicknesses of In3–xSe4 and silicon substrate are shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively. Figure 8a delineates that the highest PCE, η,
of the solar cell is 20.69% with JSC =
38.96 mA/cm2, VOC = 0.683 V,
and FF = 82.55%, for solar cell having In3–xSe4 and Si layer thicknesses of 0.10 and 300 μm,
respectively. However, the thickness of In3–xSe4 with η = 20.32% is set to 0.20 μm
for the simulation as thinner transport layer introduces huge defects
resulting in poor PV performance of the solar cells. Figure 8b reveals that the efficiency
of the In3–xSe4/p-Si
heterojunction solar cells increases with the increase of thickness
of Si substrate that happens due to the fact that thicker Si absorber
layer absorbs higher number of photons. The summarized PV parameters
of the corresponding In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells are shown in Table 2. The higher JSC and FF of the solar cells can be attributed to the
high transparency and metallic behavior of the In3–xSe4 layer.6,59 The high open-circuit
voltage instigates the better junction properties of the solar cells.
The change in PV parameters with respect to the thicknesses of In3–xSe4 and Si is also shown
in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

Doping concentrations of In3–xSe4(ND)- and Si(NA)-dependent simulated J–V characteristics of In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells are depicted in Figure 9a,b, respectively. Figure 9a reveals that both
short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage are almost independent
of donor concentration of the In3–xSe4 layer. The highest PCE, η, of the solar cell
is found to be 22.69% with JSC = 38.53
mA/cm2, VOC = 0.703 V, and
FF = 83.48%, for solar cell having In3–xSe4 and Si layer thicknesses of 0.10 and 300 μm,
respectively. On the other hand, Figure 9b shows that open-circuit voltage significantly
increases with the increase of doping concentration of Si substrate. Table 3 delineates the summarized
photovoltaic performances of the corresponding In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells. It
is observed from the table that JSC reduces
with the increase of doping density for both the cases. These results
are the consequences of recombination losses in the absorber and transport
layers due to higher doping.60,61 The change in solar
cell parameters due to the variation of doping concentration of In3–xSe4 and Si, respectively,
is also depicted in Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information.

Figure S3a,b in the Supporting
Information
represents the simulated quantum efficiency (QE) of the In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells with
the variation of thickness of In3–xSe4 and Si substrate, respectively. It is observed from
the figures that QE of the solar cells is highly dependent on the
In3–xSe4 layer thickness,
which arises due to the parasitic absorption of light in the In3–xSe4 layer. It is also
found that QE increases with Si substrate thickness. These results
are due to the fact that longer-wavelength light is absorbed at longer
distance from the junction.60,62 The simulated quantum
efficiencies (QE) with doping concentrations of In3–xSe4 and Si substrate of the CuI/n-Si heterojunction
solar cells are also shown in Figure S4a,b, respectively. The figures show that QE of the solar cells is lower
for NA = 1014 cm–3 of Si substrate; on the contrary, it is almost independent of other
doping, indicating that JSC is almost
independent of In3–xSe4 and Si substrate doping concentrations, which can also be observed
from Figure 9a,b.

The simulated PV performances of In3–xSe4/p-Si solar cells with the change in defect density
of In3–xSe4 layer are
shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information.
It is seen from the figure that PV performance of the In3–xSe4/p-Si solar cells does not significantly
change up to a defect density, Nt, of
1017 cm–3. The efficiency greatly decreases
for Nt of 1018 cm–3. The defect-density-dependent PV parameters of In3–xSe4/p-Si solar cells are also depicted
in Figure S6.

2.7.2 Junction
Formation at In3–xSe4/p-Si Interface
The built-in
potential (ψbi) at the In3–xSe4/p-Si junctions has been investigated by the
capacitive (C–V) response
employing the Mott–Schottky analysis of the solar cells in
Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS) simulation software.63 The built-in potential, ψbi, at the junction can be determined from the intercept of the 1/C2–V plot of the following
equation6 4  where A denotes the diode
area, ε0εSi denotes the permittivity
of silicon, and V denotes the applied voltage. Figure 10 shows the characteristic
1/C2–V plots for
In3–xSe4/p-Si devices
with different doping concentrations of In3–xSe4 and silicon substrate. The ψbi value is determined from the intercepts of V-axis
by fitting and extrapolating the linear portions of the curves of eq 4. The calculated built-in
potentials of the In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells are summarized in Table 4.

The built-in potentials of In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction
devices are almost independent
of In3–xSe4 doping concentration,
as seen in Figure 10a, whereas, they gradually increase with the silicon substrate doping,
as delineated in Figure 10b. These findings reveal an abrupt pn+ junction
at the In3–xSe4/p-Si
interface, where the transport mechanism is mainly dominated by the
diffusion of minority carriers.6

3 Conclusions
The electronic and optical properties
of the In3–xSe4 compound
have been studied employing
CASTEP based on the DFT method. The band structure of the In3–xSe4 compound (for x <
1/3) exhibits that the Fermi level (EF) crossed over several bands, which is an indication of highly degenerate
n-type semiconducting or metallic behavior. On the contrary, a band
gap of ∼0.2 eV was found for In3–xSe4 (x = 1/3) from the band structure
calculation. The DOS calculations ensured the metallic conductivity
of In3Se4 through dispersion of In 5s, In 5p
and Se 4s, Se 4p orbitals. The chemical bonding in In3–xSe4 materials shows mainly the ionic or
metallic and covalent nature from the electronic charge density map.
Electron-like Fermi surface appeared in the compound, which implies
its single-band character. The calculated value of carrier concentration
is ∼6.01 × 1021 cm–3, which
agrees well with the reported values. The optical study of In3–xSe4 indicates that band
gap of stoichiometric In3Se4 should be >1.62
eV, which is consistent with the reported values. We also demonstrate
the highly efficient In3Se4–x/p-Si heterojunction solar cells by SCAPS software using experimental
data. These results indicate the potential of the In3–xSe4 compound in solar energy harvesting
in future.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 First-Principles
Study
The density
functional theory (DFT) calculation using CASTEP software was performed
for demonstrating the band structure and optical properties of the
In3–xSe4 compound.64 The crystal structures of the In3–xSe4 material system were visualized by
the software VESTA.65 The localized density
approximation (LDA) of a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof solid
was carried out for assessing the electronic exchange correlation
in this work.66 The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
minimization algorithm was performed for optimization of the geometry
of In3–xSe4 system.
To achieve the optimized geometry for the structure, convergence thresholds
of 5 × 10–6 eV/atom for the total energy, 0.01
eV/Å for the maximum force, 0.02 GPa for the maximum stress,
and 5 × 10–4 Å for the maximum displacement
in the lattice were applied. For the sampling of the Brillouin zone
of the In3–xSe4 system,
the plane-wave cutoff energy (Ecut) and
Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 300 and 500
eV and 4 × 4 × 2 and 4 × 4 × 1, respectively,
were set in this calculation. For the compositional study, the value
of x in the In3–xSe4 compounds was varied in the range of 1/3 > x ≥ 0 changing the occupancy of In1 atom in 3a site
of the In3Se4 phase as the metallic behavior
comes from the excess In of the phases.42,51,52 The structure of the β-In2Se3 compound was used for the value of x = 1/3
in the calculation. The occupancy of different sites in the unit cell
of the In3–xSe4 compounds
is shown in Table S2 in the Supporting
Information.

4.2 Device Simulation
For the device
simulation of In3–xSe4/p-Si heterojunction solar cells, we essentially utilized SCAPS (Solar
Cell Capacitance Simulator) simulation software developed by Burgelman
and his team at University of Gent.67−70 The data of optical transmittance
spectra, as shown in Figure S7, band gap,
and carrier concentration were used in this simulation obtained from
the experimental data, as reported elsewhere.31 The device simulation parameters used in this study are shown in Table S3 in the Supporting Information.
