Creation
of three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructured electrodes
with controlled conductive pathways for both ions and electrons is
becoming an increasingly important strategy and is particularly of
great interest for the development of high-performance energy storage
devices. In this article, we report a facile and environmentally friendly
self-assembly approach to fabricating advanced 3D nanostructured electrodes.
The self-assembly
is simply realized via formation of a multifunctional protein coating
on the surface of electrode nanoparticles by using a denatured soy
protein derived from the abundantly prevalent soybean plant. It is
found that the denatured protein coating plays three roles simultaneously:
as a surfactant for the dispersion of electrode nanoparticles, an
ion-conductive coating for the active materials, and a binder for
the final electrode. More importantly, it is interestingly found that
being a unique surfactant, the surface protein coating enables the
self-assembly behavior of the electrode nanoparticles during the evaporation
of aqueous dispersion, which finally results in 3D porous nanostructured
electrodes. In comparison with the most classic binder, poly(vinylidene
fluoride), the advantages of the 3D nanostructured electrode in terms
of electrochemical properties (capacity and rate capability) are demonstrated.
This study provides an environmentally friendly and cost-effective
self-assembly strategy for fabrication of advanced nanostructured
electrodes using electrode nanoparticles as the building block.

Introduction
Nanostructured electrodes
enabling fast charge transfer and electrochemical
reactions play a vital role in achieving both high energy and power
densities for energy storage devices (ESDs).1−4 In particular, developing advanced
nanostructured electrodes for lithium ion batteries is believed to
be one of the most effective solutions for satisfying the increasing
demand for high energy and power densities for ESDs. This is considered
as key to the success of electric vehicles.5,6 As
a result, strategies on the fabrication of nanostructured electrodes
have attracted great interest over the past decades.7−10 In general, the strategies reported for ESDs (e.g., lithium ion
batteries) can be classified into several types as follows. The first
one, also the most common, is based on the fabrication of active nanoparticles
via nanofabrication techniques, such as the hydrothermal process11,12 and aerogel synthesis.13,14 A variety of nanoparticles,
such as nanospheres,15,16 nanorods,17,18 and nanosheets,19,20 were presented by using this
strategy to produce nanostructured electrodes. The procedures for
electrode preparation usually follow the conventional methods for
designing a porous electrode. The second strategy consists of fabricating
nanofabrics as electrodes.21−23 For this strategy, the active
materials are either made into nanofibers or deposited on a nanofabric
template. The nanofabrics provide a good combination of porous structures
for ion conduction and connect conductive networks for electron conduction.
A template-based method can be referred to as the third strategy,
which includes soft templating,24,25 hard templating,26,27 and so forth. On the basis of this strategy, fabrication of various
nanostructured active materials, such as TiO2, SnO2, LiMnO2, and so on,8,9,28,29 has been reported.
For the template-based method, one can precisely control the porous
structures and the morphology of the nanostructured electrodes. The
fourth well-known strategy is deposition. Various deposition techniques,
such as electrodeposition,30,31 chemical vapor deposition,32,33 and chemical bath deposition,34,35 are widely employed
to grow nanostructured electrodes directly on the current collectors.

Although these strategies have been widely used and have achieved
great success, developing more cost-effective strategies for fabrication
of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured electrodes is becoming more
critical for practical applications. Because almost all of the electrode
materials can be converted into nanoparticles, it would be extremely
helpful if one could introduce self-assembly behavior to these electrode
nanoparticles simply by surface treatment. In fact, polymer binders,
usually necessary in the fabrication of electrodes, might have this
potential provided they are rationally designed. However, traditional
binders are merely binder materials, which fail to represent functions
in addition to binding active materials. These binders include poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF),36,37 carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC),38,39 carboxymethyl chitosan,40,41 polyacrylic acid (PAA),42,43 gelatin,44,45 and so on. To achieve more functions
from the binder, which is critical for better electrochemical performance,
conductive binder materials have recently been of great interest.
Specifically, conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT),46,47 poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),48 and polypyrrole (PPy),49,50 have been
reported as advanced binder materials for high-capacity electrodes,
such as sulfur and silicon. The conductive binders actually play two
roles simultaneously: binding the active materials and transporting
ions/electrons inside the electrodes. It is believed that conductive
binders provide an effective solution to improving the electrochemical
performance of ESDs. However, these reported conductive binders are
usually unable to introduce self-assembly behavior to the electrode
nanoparticles, which is an attractive strategy for controlling the
porous structures, as are the ion/electron conductive pathways for
electrodes.

To address the limitations of conventional conductive
binders,
we report a novel strategy using denatured soy protein (d-SP) to form
a multifunctional surface coating on electrode nanoparticles. Our
previous studies have demonstrated that d-SP is an effective surfactant
for facilitating dispersion of graphitic materials, such as carbon
nanotubes51,52 and graphite nanoplatelets53 in water and even in a polymer matrix. More importantly,
our recent work revealed that d-SP also presents great potential in
being an advanced ion conductor for lithium ions.54 On the basis of these significant findings, herein, we
further demonstrate that d-SP can be employed as a “green”
multifunctional binder material, which integrates the multiple roles
of ion conductor, surfactant, and binder, in addition to the self-assembly
of electrode particles. As a result, a self-assembled 3D porous nanostructured
electrode is successfully fabricated, and its contribution to the
electrochemical performance of the electrode is confirmed by this
study.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the procedure of fabricating a 3D porous nanostructured electrode
via a multifunctional protein surface coating. As shown, native soy
proteins (SPs) are big powders, bonded by very strong interchain interactions,
including hydrogen bonding, disulfide bonding, and hydrophobic interactions,
which enclose a large amount of functional groups.55 Denaturation of SP breaks down the quaternary, tertiary,
and even secondary structures of the protein and discloses the polar/nonpolar
functional groups of the polypeptide.56 The particle size of SP is dramatically reduced after denaturation
from ca. 50 μm to ca. 30 nm57 to
form a yellowish solution. The d-SP acts as a surfactant, and the
nonpolar groups of d-SP (aromatic residues in particular) can strongly
interact with the surface of carbon nanomaterials through the π–π
stacking interaction;51,57 therefore, the dispersion of
carbon black (CB) in aqueous solvent is significantly improved due
to the polar groups of d-SP. During evaporation of the solvents, the
protein-coated CB nanoparticles self-assemble into a porous configuration
with the aid of the protein. Finally, the protein coating acts as
a binder as well as an ion-conductive coating for the final electrode.

Figure 1 Schematic
of the fabrication strategy for the nanostructured porous
electrodes via a multifunctional surface coating. The SP was first
denatured to unfold the functional groups of amino acids. Then, the
denatured proteins act as a multifunctional surfactant, which gives
rise to the self-assembly of electrode nanoparticles and finally a
self-assembled porous electrode.

To confirm the surface coating of d-SP on the CB surface,
we performed
studies on the dispersion, morphology, and fluorescent properties
of the d-SP treated CB. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the agglomeration of CB particles is
greatly reduced in d-SP solution as compared to that without d-SP
surface treatment (also see the optical microscopy images in Figure S1, Supporting Information). The study
indicates that d-SP can act as an effective surfactant for the electrode
nanoparticles of CB. To further investigate that d-SP is coated onto
the surface of CB, we performed a fluorescence study to obtain confocal
images, which reveals the location of the protein by absorption of
fluorescent light. The results shown in Figure 2c,d suggest that the location of green fluorescence from SP
(see Figure 2d) is
well in accordance with the location of CB, as shown in Figure 2c, which were taken from the
same place as that of the sample (also see fluorescence property of
d-SP as the control sample in Figure S2). All of the above results indicate that the d-SP, acting as a unique
surfactant, was successfully coated onto the CB nanoparticles. The
possible mechanism for the interactions between CB and d-SP is illustrated
in Figure 2e. It is
believed that the hydrophobic nature of the CB surface can strongly
interact with the nonpolar groups of d-SP, such as aromatic groups,
methyl groups, and so on, as shown in the inset of Figure 2e. At the same time, the polar
hydrophilic groups of d-SP are exposed to the aqueous solvent.

It was interestingly found that
there is a big difference in the
microstructures of the two samples: PVDF@CB and SP@CB. For PVDF@CB,
although there are lots of pores, as shown in Figure 3a,b, the porous structure is irregular and
most of the pores are found only on the surface. In contrast, for
the SP@CB electrode, the porous structures are more uniform and more
connected in 3D space, as shown by Figure 3c,d. As proteins have been reported as effective
agents for introducing self-assembly to nanoparticles,58,59 it is believed that the porous nanostructure of SP@CB is related
to a unique self-assembly behavior of the d-SP-treated CB during the
evaporation of the solvent. Owing to the fact that SP contains some
residual lipid, which may also act as a type of surfactant, we further
confirm the role of the protein as a surfactant by performing a parallel
study on another type of protein, gelatin. In contrast to SP, gelatin
is a pure protein but possesses a similar amino acid profile as SP.
As such, we also fabricated the electrodes using gelatin as the surfactant.
With the same ratios and preparation conditions, a very similar porous
nanostructure was obtained (see Figure S4 for SEM images), which further confirms that the protein is responsible
for the self-assembly behavior of the electrode nanoparticles.

multifunctional protein coating as compared with those based on the
traditional PVDF binder. SEM images of PVDF@CB (a, b) and SP@CB (c,
d). (e, f) Illustration of the microstructure of PVDF@CB and SP@CB.

Moreover, it is also believed
that the drying process is another
critical factor controlling the formation and morphology of the nanostructured
materials, that is, the kinetics of the self-assembly process. To
investigate this factor, the samples were dried at different temperatures.
At 25 °C, it was found that the high percentage of acetic acid
(80 wt %) gives rise to a very fast drying speed, which results in
a homogeneous solid electrode sample in only ca. 15 min, as shown
in Figure S5a. However, when increasing
the temperature to 50 °C to speed up the drying process, a distinctive
phase separation occurred, as shown in Figure S5b, possibly due to the different boiling points of the two
solvents (H2O and acetic acid). Therefore, to obtain a
homogeneous electrode, the appropriate drying speed is very important.

As mentioned previously, the 3D connected porous nanostructured
electrode can greatly benefit the charge transfer and electrochemical
reaction, which are critical for the electrochemical performances
of the electrodes. Figure 3e,f illustrate the difference in microstructure for the two
samples (see more SEM images in Figure S3). Specifically, the PVDF@CB sample shows an uncontrolled porous
structure, which results from a random accumulation of the CB nanoparticles
during evaporation. However, the SP@CB sample exhibits a more controlled,
continuous, and uniform porous nanostructure, which is related to
the protein-directed self-assembly of the CB nanoparticles. In addition
to the contribution to microstructures of the electrode, the protein
coating also plays two other roles: as a binder for the electrode
and an ion-conductive coating of the electrode nanoparticles, which
has been revealed in our recent studies on using the protein–ion
complex as an advanced ion conductor.54

To demonstrate the advantages of the self-assembled, porous,
nanostructured
electrode, the electrochemical performance of the CB-based electrodes
was characterized at room temperature. Figure 4a compares the discharge curves of SP@CB
and PVDF@CB at the same current density of 60 mA g–1. It can be found that the specific discharge capacity of SP@CB (154
mA h g–1) is greatly higher than that of PVDF@CB
(107 mA h g–1). At the same time, a very high initial
discharge capacity (∼262 mA h g–1 at 60 mA
g–1) was achieved by SP@CB, and then the discharge
capacity gradually stabilized around 150 mA h g–1 at a current density of 60 mA g–1 (Figure 4b). The initial capacity loss
might be related to the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase
(SEI).60 The notable capacity loss related
to SEI formation also indicates that the SP@CB sample possesses a
high surface area for electrochemical reactions, which is consistent
with the 3D porous structures, as shown by the SEM images in Figure 3c,d.

Figure 4 Electrochemical performance

with that of PVDF@CB at a low current density of 60 mA g–1. (a) Galvanostatic discharge profile between 3 and 0 V for the second
cycle. (b) Galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the SP@CB
electrode at the 1st, 5th, 20th, and 50th cycle.

Another significant contribution of the 3D porous nanostructures
to electrochemical performance is the improvement in rate capability.
Therefore, the SP@CB and PVDF@CB electrodes were tested at various
current densities of 60, 150, 300, 600, and 900 mA g–1. As shown in Figure 5a, for porous SP@CB, the charge–discharge profiles at different
current densities are very similar, which indicates that the lithiation/delithiation
process behaves reversibly and stably at different current densities. Figure 5b compares the rate
capability between SP@CB and PVDF@CB. It is found that the discharge
capacities of both SP@CB and PVDF@CB are very stable at a certain
current density. However, the capacity of PVDF@CB decayed dramatically
when the current density increased from 60 to 900 mA g–1. The capacity retention is only about 29%. In contrast, as for SP@CB,
the capacity retention is around 50% when the current density increased
from 60 to 900 mA g–1. Moreover, the SP@CB electrode
can recover a specific capacity of 130 mA h g–1 at
a current density of 150 mA g–1, indicating a high
capacity retention rate of 96% after the C-rate testing. However,
for PVDF@CB, the capacity retention rate is about 90% after the same
C-rate testing, as shown in Figure 5b.

profiles of the SP@CB electrode at various current densities. (b)

of fresh half-cells based on SP@CB and PVDF@CB electrodes at a frequency
range of 0.01–1 MHz.

In addition to the excellent rate capability, the porous
SP@CB
also shows good cycle stability. As displayed in Figure 5c, after 50 cycles at a current
density of 60 mA g–1, the capacity of SP@CB is almost
the same as the initial capacity of 154 mA h g–1 and no evident capacity loss can be observed. Moreover, the capacity
of SP@CB is much more stable than that of PVDF@CB. For the control
sample containing PVDF, it is noted that the loading of active material
(50 wt %) is greatly lower than the classic loading for commercial
electrodes (ca. 80 wt %). The extra PVDF may form a thick coating
surface on the active materials and deteriorate the electrochemical
performance. Therefore, another control sample with 20 wt % loading
of PVDF was prepared, and the comparison of the cycling performance
is shown in Figure 5c. At the same current rate of 60 mA g–1, this
control electrode delivers a discharge capacity of 161 mA h g–1, which is slightly greater than that of the SP@CB
electrode (154 mA h g–1). However, as seen in Figure 5c, this control electrode
shows a faster capacity decay as compared with that of the SP@CB electrode.
In particular, the capacity faded even faster after the 23rd cycle,
and the capacity is much lower than that of the SP@CB electrode afterward.
The poor cycling performance of this control sample is possibly due
to unstable structures or poor dispersion of the electrode nanoparticles.
Therefore, the SP@CB electrode shows advantages in terms of specific
capacity and cycle stability as compared with those of the PVDF ones.

At the same time, the Nyquist plots, as shown in Figure 5d for SP@CB and PVDF@CB electrodes,
further confirm that porous SP@CB possesses a much lower charge transfer
resistance because the diameter of the semicircle reflects the charge
transfer resistance of the electrode.40,46 These good
electrochemical performances of the SP@CB electrode should be attributed
to the following factors. First, the protein surface coating plays
the role of an advanced binder, which gives rise to good structure
and cycle stability. Second, the protein surface coating is also ion
conductive and can significantly facilitate the charge transfer and
ion conductions of the electrode particles, which can be revealed
by the low resistance for charge transfer and high specific capacity.
Third, the self-assembled porous structure is one of the keys for
good rate capability.

To investigate the possible contribution
of the d-SP to lithium
ion storage, a d-SP/CB composite with 80 wt % loading of d-SP was
prepared and tested in a half-cell. In this case, d-SP is assumed
to be an active material. It was found that the capacity of the entire
electrode, including d-SP and CB, is only 16 mA h g–1. As shown in Figure S7a, if d-SP is not
viewed as an electrode material, the specific capacity for CB is about
82 mA h g–1, which is still far below that of the
porous nanostructured SP@CB electrode (154 mA h g–1). In addition, the Nyquist plot of the SP/CB composite sample (Figure S7b) shows one well-defined semicircle
in the high-frequency region with a much larger charge transfer resistance
as compared with that of the SP@CB nanostructured electrode. These
results indicate that the d-SP itself has negligible or even no capacity
for lithium ion storage. Therefore, it is further confirmed that the
enhancement of electrochemical properties of the above porous SP@CB
electrode is owing to the self-assembled 3D porous nanostructure and
the ion-conductive surface coating.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated a multifunctional protein surface
coating of electrode nanoparticles to fabricate 3D porous nanostructured
electrodes via self-assembly. The protein surface coating can play
three roles simultaneously: as a surfactant of the electrode nanoparticles
that drives self-assembly during evaporation, an ionic conductive
coating that facilitates the ion-transfer between electrolyte and
electrode, and, finally, a stable binder that maintains the structures
for stable cycling. Benefiting from its multifunctionalities, the
capacity, cycle stability, and rate capability of the resultant self-assembled
porous electrode are significantly improved as compared with those
of traditional electrodes. This study provides a cost-effective and
important strategy for fabrication of porous nanostructured electrodes
via the self-assembly of electrode nanoparticles.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
SP isolate powders (Archer Daniels
Midland Co.) were denatured in a mixture of solvent (80 wt % acetic
acid, 20 wt % H2O) with an ambient pH value of ca. 1.8
at a 3 wt % SP concentration. Specifically, the mixed solvent was
first preheated to 95 °C prior to the addition of SP. SP powders
were then slowly and slightly added into the solvent with vigorous
stirring. The dispersion containing SP was stirred at 95 °C for
1 h to form a yellowish solution. To fabricate the electrodes, nanoparticles
of CB (SuperC45; MTI) are employed as an example of electrode nanoparticles.
Typically, the denatured SP (d-SP) solution was first cooled to room
temperature. The electrode nanoparticles were dispersed into 5 mL
of the solution of d-SP with the aid of an ultrasonifier (Branson
250) with an amplitude of 15% for 3 min in an ice bath. The weight
ratio between SP and CB is 1:1. Finally, the homogeneous dispersion
was casted by a film applicator controlling the thickness of the solution
constant onto copper foil and evaporated at room temperature, which
drives the self-assembly of the electrode nanoparticles. The solid
electrode sample was further dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven
for 12 h and then transferred into a glovebox. The reference sample
was prepared by mixing the same CB with PVDF binder solution in NMP
(Mw = 530 000 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich),
wherein PVDF powders were first dissolved in NMP (VWR) at a concentration
of 5 wt %. The weight ratio between the CB and PVDF binder is the
same as that for the SP system. This control sample was also dried
under the same conditions, as described above. The weight of active
material of each electrode was determined at 0.6–0.7 mg/cm2. The thicknesses of all of the samples were measured by using
a digital micrometer. The thickness of SP@CB electrodes is 13 ±
3 μm and it is 17 ± 2 μm for the PVDF@CB electrodes.
For confirming the role of the protein that directs the self-assembly,
a parallel experiment was also performed on gelatin protein (type
A, from porcine skin, Sigma-Aldrich). The gelatin solution was prepared
by dissolving the gelatin powders in the same solvent (80 wt % acetic
acid, 20 wt % H2O) at a concentration of 3 wt %. To prepare
the gelatin-containing electrodes, the procedures are exactly the
same as those for the preparation of SP@CB electrodes. The density
of the d-SP was measured as follows. The 3 wt % d-SP solution was
first casted onto aluminum foil to be dried at room temperature to
obtain solid d-SP films. The d-SP films were further dried in a vacuum
oven at 60 °C for 12 h to remove all residual solvents. The weight
of the dried d-SP films was then measured. To evaluate the volume,
the d-SP films were immersed in NMP solvent in a cylinder, and the
volume change of the solvent was recorded, which referred to the volume
of the d-SP. Three measurements have been performed to obtain the
average density. The density can then be calculated based on the obtained
weight and volume, and it was determined to be ca. 1.32 g/cm3.

Structural Characterization
The morphology of all of
the samples was characterized by SEM (Quanta 200F) and optical microscopy
(Olympus BX51). For the optical microscopy observation, a very small
amount of suspension sample was directly casted on a glass substrate
and was covered by a coverslip to observe the dispersion of the CB
particles. Prior to the optical microscopy observation, the suspension
samples were treated by sonifier for 3 min to disperse CB particles
in the solvents. For confocal microscopy characterization, the suspension
samples were dispersed in PEO (Mw = 100 000
g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich) solution for stable particle detection. Confocal
images were acquired using a ZEISS confocal microscope. The 488 nm
line from an argon laser was used for excitation, and fluorescence
emission was detected using a 510 nm band-pass filter.

Cell Assembly
and Electrochemical Characterization
Half cells with lithium
metal as the counter electrode were assembled
into a coin cell in an argon-filled glovebox. A commercial separator
(Celgard, trilayer PP/PE/PP) was soaked in liquid electrolyte (1 M
LiPF6 in EC/DMC, volume ratio: 1:1, Sigma-Aldrich). Prior
to employing a separator, one droplet of liquid electrolyte was dropped
onto the surface of the prepared CB electrode to wet the surface.
The electrochemical performance of the half-cells was examined by
cycling the cells between 3 and 0 V by using a battery analyzer (BST8-MA;
MTI) at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was
used to measure the impedance of the cells via an electrochemical
workstation (CHI660E) over a frequency range of 0.01–106 Hz.
