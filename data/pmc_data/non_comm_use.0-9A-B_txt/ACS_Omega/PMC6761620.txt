Dopant-induced local
electric fields and their influence on the
band-edge absorption of GaN are theoretically examined. For dopant-induced
electric field distribution, it is derived with Bayes’ rule.
For the average electric field strength, it is revealed to be quite
strong, i.e., in an order of 104 V/cm in GaN with a fairly
low dopant density. On the basis of the Franz–Keldysh mechanism,
influence of the dopant-induced electric fields on the band-edge absorption
coefficient of GaN is then investigated. Without any adjustable parameters,
absorption coefficients of GaN are computed and in good agreement
with the available experimental values.

I Introduction
Gallium nitride (GaN)
is a wide band gap semiconductor that can
be used in the production of new power electronics, RF components,
and light-emitting devices. As the Si technology is approaching its
ultimate limits, GaN technology is on the rise for today and tomorrow.
To further prompt the GaN technology demands understanding and manipulating
GaN in new ways, such as doping control at the atomic level and the
related effects. For instance, in a recent study, Tuomisto et al.
have proved a big promise of beryllium doping for GaN power electronics
if the Be dopants in GaN and their electronic properties can be fully
controlled.1 Actually, impurity doping
plays a vital role in the fabrication of almost all the semiconductor
devices,2 not only in the GaN-based devices.3−5 Moreover, further development and optimization of GaN-based electronic
and optoelectronic devices require control over the doping of GaN-based
materials. To fully control the doping of GaN, a deeper fundamental
understanding of the dopant issues is necessary.6 For example, there have been very few studies on electric
fields induced by ionized dopants and relevant effects in GaN so far.
In particular, the present understanding of the relationship between
dopant-induced electric fields and band-edge absorption coefficients
in GaN is very limited. In the very early studies, Redfield theoretically
investigated the distribution of electric fields in solid-containing
dopants and the influence on the optical absorption edge of the solid.7 His major conclusions are that in nonmetallic
solids, the dopant-induced local electric fields are substantial and
their effects are significant. It is obvious that taking an explicit
consideration to the dopant-induced local electric fields and their
effects in GaN is of scientific and technical significance and is
hence highly desirable. Furthermore, we may obtain useful information
of dopant density in GaN by establishing the relationship between
the band-edge absorption coefficients and dopant density.

In
this article, we theoretically investigate the strength and
distribution of electric fields in GaN with different densities of
dopants. Then, we compute the influence of dopant-induced fields on
the absorption coefficients of GaN in terms of the Franz–Keldysh
effect.

II Theory
II.I Dopant-Induced Electrical
Fields and Distribution
To evaluate the electric fields of
dopants in a crystal of static
dielectric constant εr, we assume that N singly charged dopants (point defects) per m33 are randomly distributed within the crystal.
According to the Coulomb law, a local electric field by a singly charged
dopant may be represented as 1  where e is the electron
charge,
ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, and r0 is the radius of a sphere whose volume is
the mean volume of a dopant. Thus, r0 may
be defined by 2  For many purposes, as stated by Redfield,7 it is the most useful way to define a probability W(F)dF of finding a field
of magnitude F. When normalized to unity, it is the
fraction of the volume of a crystal occupied by fields in the range
of F to F + dF.
Under a first approximation, only the Coulomb field of the nearest
charge ion is taken into account for the calculation of electric field
distributions. This “nearest ion distribution” can be
readily found from the position distribution function of random points.8 Herein, we use a more general approach (i.e.,
the conditional probability theorem) to derive the expression of W(F)dF. Selecting a dopant
(radiating atom) as the center, we describe a sphere of radius r about it. P(r) denotes
the probability of finding at least one ion (charged dopant) within
it. To obtain P(r), we may use the
conditional probability theorem, also widely known as Bayes’
rule. By Bayes’ rule, we have 3  where P(r|r + dr) is a conditional
probability:
the likelihood of an event r to occur given that
event r + dr is true. Similarly, P(r + dr|r) is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of an event r + dr to occur given that event r is true.

According to the definition of P(r), we can clearly conclude that P(r + dr|r) = 1, so that eq 3 can
be reduced as 4  where P′(r) is the first-order
derivative of P(r).

Considering
that dopants are randomly distributed in the crystal
lattice, we also have 5  where rC is the
event of complement of r, P(dr|r) is the probability of an
event that there is at least one dopant within the spherical shell
of radius r and thickness dr.

Combining eqs 4 and 5, we can get 6  Considering the boundary
conditions P(0) = 0 and ∫0∞dP(r) = 1, we can yield 7  In terms of r0 and F0 described by eqs 2 and 1, respectively,
we can rewrite eq 7 as 8   9  Actually, eq 9 is just the same as the nearest ion distribution
in
weakly ionized plasmas.8

By letting β = F/F0, eq 9 can be
rewritten as 10  

and 11  

II.II Band-Edge Absorption
in the Presence of
Dopant-Induced Electric Fields
To evaluate the effects of
the electric fields of charged dopants on the band-edge absorption
coefficients of the semiconductors, Redfield7 theoretically treated it by invoking the analogy with the Franz–Keldysh
effect.9,10 Redfield’s theoretical treatment
requires making the following approximations:7(i) All transitions
are assumed to allow
band-to-band transitions. The excitonic effect is totally ignored.

(ii) The electric field is
treated as
a uniform field in every small but macroscopic volume element of the
crystal.



Under these assumptions, the
total absorption coefficient
may be computed by 12  where A(ω,F) is the expression
describing the local absorption coefficient for
angular frequency ω in the presence of a field F, whereas W(F) is the probability
of finding an electric field of magnitude F, which
is found in eq 11.

For F ≠ 0, A(ω,F) may be expressed by9 13  Here, ωF is defined by 14   is the reduced mass with me* and mh* as the
effective
masses of the electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands,
respectively. ℏωg = Eg gives the fundamental band gap of the crystal, whereas Γ(z) = ∫0∞xz–1e–xdx is the
γ function.11 For z = 3/2, Γ(3/2) = √π/2.

At ω = ωg, eq 13 may
become simply 15  For the absorption below the band
gap, the
computation becomes considerably more difficult and has to be performed
numerically. Furthermore, the infinite range of fields in the integration
of eq 12 precludes the
use of any of the approximate formulae. In fact, to obtain a rigorous
expression for A(ω,F), Tharmalingam
reformulated Franz’s result and yielded12 16  where  is the Airy function.13 Since the Airy
function satisfies the differential equation 17  The last integral in eq 16 can be evaluated to
give 18  where prime denotes derivative
of the Airy
function with respect to the argument.

It should be noted that
to convert A(ω,F) to the absolute
absorption coefficient α(ω,F), all that
is needed is to multiply it by an appropriate
factor R. It may be represented by12 19  where C0 involves
the matrix element having the dimensions of momentum, c is the speed of light in vacuum, n is the refractive
index of the crystal, and m0 is the rest
mass of free electrons.

III Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
average electric fields F0 (bottom) induced
by dopants and the mean radii r0 (top)
of one dopant in GaN, calculated by eqs 1 and 2, respectively. As expected,
the average electric field induced by ionized dopants monotonically
increases with the increasing dopant density, whereas the mean radius
of a dopant decreases in a monotonic manner. The dopant-induced local
electric field in a GaN of fair purity is substantially strong, e.g., F0 ∼ 104 V/cm for N = 1017 cm–3 dopants. At this dopant
density, the mean radius of one dopant is about 20 nm, which means
that the local field is distributed over such a range. Clearly, the
dopant-induced electric fields in GaN cannot be ignored, and they
may have substantial impact on the photophysical properties of GaN
as proved later. Parameters of GaN adopted in the calculations are
tabulated in Table 1.

Figure 2 shows the
distribution of dopant electric fields described by eq 11. From the definition of β
= F/F0, it can be well-justified
that the magnitudes of the electric fields are distributed most probably
around F0, which acts like a scale factor.7 For small and large values of β, respectively, eq 11 can have the two alternate
expressions 20  In particular, the probability distribution
of high electric fields decreases as β–5/2.

From transmission measurements, Muth et al. obtained the
band-edge
absorption coefficient of GaN, as listed in Table 1.16 We calculated
the band-edge absorption coefficients of GaN under the action of different
electric fields, as shown in Figure 3. Calculated band-edge absorption coefficient of GaN
at an electric field of 6 × 103 V/cm is comparable
to their measured value. As shown later, this field corresponds to
a dopant density of 4 × 1016 cm–3. Actually, the dopant concentration in GaN is fairly low. It is
known that nominally undoped GaN shows a usually high n-type conductivity
with an electron concentration of 4 × 1016 to 9 ×
1018 cm–3.19 Furthermore, the theoretical absorption coefficient of GaN rapidly
increases with increasing electric field, which can be understood
as the electric-field-induced Stark effect.

absorption coefficients of GaN vs electric
field. Note that the curve is plotted in semilogarithmic scale.

Figure 4 illustrates
the calculated band-edge absorption coefficients of GaN vs dopant
density. It can be seen that the band-edge absorption coefficient
of GaN shows a strong dependence on dopant density. In fact, the strong
dependence of the band-edge absorption coefficient of GaN on dopant
density also reflects the significant effect of electric fields induced
by ionized dopants.

dopant density.
Note that the curve is plotted in a semilogarithmic scale.

It is instructive to discuss the several limiting cases for
absorption:(i) For ω > ωg and
near the band edge 21  

Obviously, for F → 0, and
ω >
ωg, we obtain the familiar classic expression for
absorption coefficient with the square root dependence on the photon
energy or frequency,20 of course, relative
to the band gap.(ii) For ω < ωg and , using asymptotic series of the Airy function,  and 



we can obtain 22  hence giving an exponential decaying
tail
in the long wavelength region below the band gap. Such an exponential
tail in the absorption coefficient for ω ≪ ωg is consistent with the well-known Urbach’s tail rule.21

Figure 5 shows the
theoretical absorption curves of GaN with full theoretical model (i.e., eqs 12 and 16) and a simplified model (i.e., eq 21) for a relatively fair low density of dopant,
respectively. For ω ≫ ωg, i.e., well
above the band gap, the two curves coincide with each other. For ω
> ωg, good agreement between the full theoretical
model and simplified formula is still seen. But some oscillatory structures
can be observed on the absorption curve by the full theoretical model
caused by the oscillatory nature of the Airy function. For ω
< ωg, i.e., below the band gap, however, there
is a substantial difference between the two theoretical curves. The
curve by the simplified model directly goes down to zero at the band
edge (ω = ωg), whereas the curve predicted
by the full theoretical model roughly exhibits an exponential decaying
tendency. Obviously, the simplified model is only valid for above
the band gap and fails to predict the absorption curves at the band
gap and below band gap. To have a better and clearer inspection into
the exponential decaying tendency below band gap, we enlarge the absorption
curve (solid line) below band gap with the full theoretical model
in Figure 6. Meanwhile,
we also plot a curve calculated with a simplified formula described
by eq 22 for comparison.
Clearly, both full model and simplified formula can predict a nearly
identical exponential decaying tendency for absorption coefficients
below band gap. The exponential decaying tail is just expected by
Urbach’s law.21

coefficients of GaN vs photon energy with
a full theoretical model and a simplified model (i.e., eq 21).

Figure 6 Enlarged
absorption curves of GaN below band gap with the full
theoretical model and a simplified formula (i.e., eq 22). The absorption coefficients
are depicted in logarithmic scale such that exponential decaying tendency
can be better seen.

It should be noted that
no adjustable parameters are adopted in
the above calculations. However, the exciton effect on the absorption
coefficient of GaN is not taken into account. In the absence of an
electric field, the exciton effect has been considered by Elliot.22 In the presence of an electric field, theoretical
treatment on the absorption coefficient of excitons becomes quite
complicated.23 For GaN considered here,
its exciton effect shall be weak at room temperature because the binding
energy of excitons in GaN is about 25 meV.24 At room temperature (i.e., 295 K or the corresponding thermal energy
∼25.4 meV), most of the excitons may be thermalized into free
electrons and holes. It is thus reasonable for one not to consider
the exciton effect in the room-temperature absorption of GaN.

Another noticing point is that the polar electric field caused
by longitudinal optical phonons in GaN with wurtzite crystal structure
is not taken into account. Such a polar field may result in some periodic
structures, i.e., phonon sidebands in absorption and luminescence
spectrum.

Finally, we present a direct comparison between our
theoretical
curve (solid circles) and Muth et al.’s experimental data (star
symbols) for GaN, as shown in Figure 7. Overall, a reasonable agreement between theory and
experiment is achieved for a dopant density of 3 × 1020 cm–3. In particular, very good agreement exists
for photon energies below the band gap, indicating that the dopant-induced
electric fields indeed play a major role in determining the below-band-gap
absorption coefficients of GaN. However, above the band gap, a deviation
between theory and experiment is observed. This discrepancy could
be caused by an overestimation of the absorption coefficients of GaN
by the theoretical model.

IV Summary
We employ the Bayes’ rule to derive
the probability distribution
of the dopant-induced local electric fields in solid, and then apply
it to calculate the influence of fields on the absorption coefficients
of GaN with different dopant densities. It is shown that a strong
electric field of ∼104 V/cm may exist in an about
20 nm range in GaN with a fairly low dopant density and has a significant
impact on the band-edge absorption coefficients of GaN on the basis
of the Franz–Keldysh mechanism. It is unveiled that the band-edge
absorption coefficient of GaN increases strongly with increasing dopant
density. Moreover, analytical expressions of absorption coefficients
of GaN in some limiting cases are approximated using the known properties
of the Airy function.
