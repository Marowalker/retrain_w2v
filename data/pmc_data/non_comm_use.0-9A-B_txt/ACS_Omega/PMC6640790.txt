We report the synthesis
of a three-dimensional graphene (3DG)–TiO2 nanocomposite
by covalently attaching P25 TiO2 nanoparticles onto pristine
3DG through a perfluorophenyl azide-mediated
coupling reaction. The TiO2 nanoparticles were robustly
attached on the 3DG surface, with minimal particle agglomeration.
In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite demonstrated excellent activity, about 11 times
higher than that of the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. The enhanced
activity can be partially attributed to the highly dispersed state
of the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles on the 3DG substrate. This
3DG-based system offers a new platform for fabricating photocatalytic
materials with enhanced activities.

Introduction
Among the different
forms of graphene, the recently developed three-dimensional
graphene (3DG) has attracted increasing attention owing to its unique
features.1,2 3DG, with foamlike macrostructures, can
be prepared by self-assembly,3 templating,4 or chemical vapor deposition (CVD).5 3DG possesses many interesting properties in
addition to those of typical two-dimensional graphene (2DG) nanosheets.
For example, the interconnected porous structure of 3DG provides divergent
pathways to conduct heat and electrons. The 3D nature of such materials
eliminates intersheet contact resistance and reduces agglomeration
of individual graphene nanosheets.1,2 Other desirable
properties of 3DG include increased surface area, control over size
and shape, and ease of handling and reuse. These features make 3DG
a promising material for many applications, including photocatalysis
and energy storage. Graphene has been shown to enhance the activities
of semiconductor photocatalysts, where graphene acts as an electron
acceptor and transporter in graphene–photocatalyst nanocomposite
materials.6−13 The outstanding conductivity and electron mobility across the graphene
network allow for rapid electron collection and transfer, suppressing
electron–hole recombination, which lowers the photocatalytic
activity of semiconductors. The relatively high specific surface areas
of graphene materials also contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic
efficiency of semiconductors. Recently, 3DG has been used to prepare
nanocomposite materials with semiconductor photocatalysts14 by physisorption of TiO2 nanoparticles
onto 3D graphene oxide (3DGO)15,16 or 3DG17,18 or by chemisorption onto 3DGO.19 Compared
with physisorption, chemisorption provides a higher stability and
stronger interactions between the individual components and subsequently
improves the photocatalytic performance.11,12 For example, glucose was used as a linker between TiO2 nanoparticles and 3DGO to achieve a higher stability and photocatalytic
activity compared to those of the nanocomposite prepared without glucose.19 Although GO is relatively easier to prepare
in large quantities, the oxidation process employed in its synthesis
is usually detrimental to its electronic properties, which cannot
be fully recovered even after subsequent reduction due to the presence
of oxygen-containing species and defects introduced during the synthesis.20

Here, we report a new 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite
photocatalyst, synthesized by covalently attaching P25 TiO2 nanoparticles onto pristine 3DG by perfluorophenyl azide (PFPA)-mediated
coupling chemistry.21−23 We expect that the TiO2 nanoparticles
would be uniformly distributed on 3DG, with minimal particle agglomeration.
Agglomeration is detrimental to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, as it reduces the surface area accessible to adsorb the
reagents. In conjunction with pristine 3DG, the resulting nanocomposite
material would have enhanced photocatalytic activities, for example,
CO2 reduction, compared to those of P25 TiO2 alone.

Experimental Section
Materials
Methyl pentafluorobenzoate
(>97%), sodium
azide, AEROXIDE TiO2 P25, acetone, ethyl ether, methanol,
triethylamine (>99%), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),
and hydrochloric acid (37%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
were used as received, without any further purification. Nickel foam
(Ni, 95% porosity, thickness 1.6 mm) was purchase from MTI Corp.

Preparation of 3DG and 2DG
3DG on nickel (Ni) foam
was prepared on the AIXTRON CVD equipment. Interconnected Ni foam
was used as the substrate. The Ni foam was cut into small pieces (2
× 2 cm2). It was first annealed in an Ar/H2 atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h to increase the grain size and
clean the surface. Graphene layers were then grown by introducing
ultra-high-purity CH4 gas for 30 min. After exposure to
CH4, the furnace was cooled to room temperature. The Raman
spectrum of prepared Ni–G is shown in Figure S1.

2DG was prepared by liquid-phase exfoliation. Graphite
flakes (Sigma) were dispersed in NMP to give a concentration of 1
mg/mL, and the mixture was sonicated using a sonication probe (20
kHz, 40% Ampl.; SONICS) for 24 h. The resulting dispersion was then
centrifuged for 30 min at 500 rpm, and the supernatant was collected.

Preparation of 3DG–TiO2 and 2DG–TiO2
4-Azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoic acid (PFPA-COOH)
was synthesized following the previously reported protocol.24−26 A piece of 3DG(Ni) was placed in a solution of PFPA-COOH (88 mg)
in NMP (15 mL) and heated at 150 °C for 3 h. The sample was then
washed with acetone to remove excess reagents. The PFPA-functionalized
3DG(Ni) and P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (∼5 mg) were
dispersed in ethanol and heated at 100 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave for 24 h. The Ni foam support was then etched away
by immersing the resulting sample in a solution of 1 M FeCl3 and 3 M HCl. Free-standing 3DG–TiO2 was obtained
after rinsing the sample with HCl followed by water. The control sample,
2DG–TiO2, was prepared following the same protocol
as that for 3DG–TiO2, by surface functionalization
with PFPA-COOH and covalent attachment of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles.

Characterization
Raman spectra were recorded on a SENTERRA
Raman microscope (Bruker) system with a 532 nm wavelength laser. Infrared
(IR) spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images were acquired on a field-emission SEM (JSM 7401F; JEOL) equipped
with an Oxford INCA energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) system.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a Philips
EM400T microscope operated at 120 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
patterns were obtained on a Scintag PAD X X-ray diffractometer using
Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were carried out on a Vacuum Generators Escalab MK II X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer. All XPS spectra were referenced to the binding energy
of the C 1s of adventitious carbon at 285.0 eV. Elemental analysis
was conducted by acid digestion of solid samples, followed by quantification
using a Varian Vista AX inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectrometer. The optical absorption properties of the materials were
obtained on a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer. A Barrelino diffuse reflectance
probe was used to collect UV–visible spectra, using BaSO4 as a standard.

Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
Before photocatalysis,
a piece of 3DG–TiO2 (dimension 2 × 2 ×
0.1 cm3) or 1 mg of P25 TiO2 was placed in a
sealed test tube. The test tube was purged with a mixture of high-purity
CO2 gas (99.999%, Airgas) and triethylamine vapor for 20
min. The sample was then irradiated with a 200 W mercury lamp. The
light intensity on the sample was fixed at 140 mW/cm2.
The head space was sampled with a gas-tight syringe at different time
intervals for product analysis using Agilent 7820 GC, equipped with
a thermal conductivity detector and a 60/80 Carboxen-1000 packed column
(Supelco).

Results and Discussion
3DG was prepared
by growing graphene on an interconnected nickel
(Ni) foam by CVD at 1000 °C using CH4 gas as the precursor.5 The Raman spectrum of the synthesized sample,
3DG(Ni), shows the presence of both single- and multi-layered graphene
(Figure S1). This is in good agreement
with the typical 3DG samples grown on Ni foam by CVD, which is attributed
to the polycrystalline nature of nickel foam.5 Further analysis by XRD also confirms the graphene structure (Figure S2).

The 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst was
synthesized using a straightforward procedure involving PFPA-mediated
coupling chemistry, as shown in Scheme 1 (see Supporting Information for experimental details). In a typical synthesis, 3DG(Ni) was first
functionalized with PFPA-COOH at 150 °C.27,28 The reaction occurred through the highly reactive perfluorophenyl
nitrene intermediate, which gave the covalent adduct and introduced
carboxyl groups on 3DG.21−23,29−33 The covalent functionalization of graphene was followed by XPS.
Before the XPS analysis, the Ni foam support was etched away in a
solution of FeCl3/HCl. The PFPA-functionalized 3DG showed
F 1s (689 eV) and N 1s (401 eV) peaks (Figure 1b), which were absent in the spectrum of
3DG (Figure 1a). Furthermore,
the N 1s peaks of the azide, at 402.1 and 405.6 eV, with an intensity
ratio of 2:1,32 were not seen in the spectrum
of PFPA-functionalized 3DG. Instead, only one peak at 401 eV was observed
(Figure 1c), which
could be assigned to the N in the PFPA-functionalized graphene structure.33 The presence of the F 1s peak at 689 eV after
functionalization of 3DG with PFPA (Figure 1d) is consistent with our previous results
for PFPA-functionalized graphene.32,33 Taken together,
these results provided clear evidence for the successful functionalization
of 3DG with PFPA.

carbon at 285.0 eV (C 1s).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 3DG–TiO2
The commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles,
Degussa
P25, were used to synthesize the nanocomposite photocatalyst. The
TiO2 nanoparticles were covalently attached onto 3DG(Ni)–PFPA
through binding with the carboxyl groups on the 3DG surface (Scheme 1) by a solvothermal
process.34 This was done before removing
the Ni foam substrate to maintain the 3DG(Ni)–PFPA framework
during the solvothermal treatment to attach the TiO2 nanoparticles.34 After washing the resulting material with ethanol
to remove excess P25 nanoparticles, the Ni foam substrate was etched
away using FeCl3/HCl. Free-standing 3DG–TiO2 was obtained after rinsing the synthesized nanocomposite
with HCl and water.

The morphology of 3DG and 3DG–TiO2 was examined
using SEM. The interconnected 3DG structure with a pore size of ∼200
μm was well maintained without collapsing or cracking during
the etching of the Ni foam substrate by the acid (Figure 2a,b). The ripples and wrinkles
observed on the graphene surface (Figure 2c,d) are common for graphene fabricated on
a Ni substrate, which are induced by the difference in the thermal
expansion coefficients of graphene and Ni.35 After the attachment of TiO2 nanoparticles, highly dispersed
nanoparticles ∼20 nm in size were observed on 3DG (Figure 2d). The TiO2 nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the 3DG surface, without
significant agglomeration. Furthermore, these results demonstrate
that the PFPA covalent coupling chemistry was robust, and the TiO2 nanoparticles remained firmly attached on the 3DG surface
even after the samples were subjected to strong acid treatment.

Figure 2 SEM images
of (a,c) 3DG and (b,d) 3DG–TiO2. Images
(c) and (d) were taken at a higher magnification.

Control experiments were carried out to further confirm the
covalent
attachment of TiO2 nanoparticles on 3DG. In one experiment,
samples were prepared from 3DG in the same manner except that the
3DG was not functionalized with PFPA-COOH. In this case, only a few
aggregates of TiO2 nanoparticles were seen on the 3DG surface
(Figure S3), suggesting that the TiO2 nanoparticles were conjugated on 3DG through the PFPA coupling
chemistry in the 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite. In another
control experiment, 2DG flakes, prepared by exfoliating the graphite
powder in NMP under sonication, were functionalized with PFPA-COOH,
followed by covalent attachment of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles.
In the resulting material (2DG–TiO2), most of the
TiO2 nanoparticles were agglomerated (Figure S4), suggesting that the framework of 3DG is important
in dispersing the TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the
TiO2 nanoparticles on the 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite
prepared by PFPA coupling chemistry showed a higher dispersibility
than that on 2DG–TiO236 or 3DG–TiO2 materials prepared by other methods.16,18

Furthermore, the 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite
was characterized
by XRD. Figure 3 shows
the XRD pattern of 3DG–TiO2. The typical diffraction
peaks of P25 TiO2, consisting of both the anatase phase
[2θ = 25° (101), 37° (004), 38° (112), 48°
(200)] and the rutile phase [2θ = 27° (110), 36° (101),
41° (111), 44° (210)], were observed.36 The intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.5° is
characteristic of the (002) hexagonal graphitic carbon (JCPDS card
No. 75-1621) in 3DG (Figures 3 and S2).37 The presence of Ti and O in 3DG–TiO2 was also
confirmed by EDX (Figure S5). The Ti content
was determined to be 2.9 mmol/g on 3DG–TiO2 by elemental
analysis after acid digestion of the nanocomposite material.

of (a) P25 TiO2 and (b) 3DG–TiO2 (●:
anatase, ■: rutile).

3DG–TiO2 was tested for its performance
in photocatalytic
CO2 reduction in comparison to that of P25 TiO2, using triethylamine as a sacrificial electron donor (Figure 4). Under the experimental conditions
employed in this study, CO was observed to be the only gaseous product
upon photocatalytic CO2 reduction. After
4 h, the amounts of CO generated per per milligram of TiO2 were 0.11 and 1.26 μmol/mg for P25 TiO2 and 3DG−TiO2, respectively. This represents an 11-fold higher activity
for 3DG–TiO2 than that for P25 TiO2.
This enhancement in photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the
high specific surface area of the 3DG support and the excellent dispersion
of TiO2 nanoparticles on 3DG in the 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite, which provide more accessible surfaces to
reagents and better light harvesting. Other contributing factors include
the strong interactions between the TiO2 nanoparticles
and 3DG, resulting from the covalent attachment. Further studies using
electrochemical methods are underway to probe possible electronic
interactions between TiO2 nanoparticles and the 3DG framework.

testing.

Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized
a new graphene-based photocatalyst consisting
of TiO2 nanoparticles covalently attached to 3DG. The TiO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed on the 3DG surface, without
significant agglomeration. This nanocomposite material demonstrated
a considerably higher activity than that of bare TiO2 in
photocatalytic CO2 reduction, likely due to the high specific
surface area of the 3DG substrate, the strong interactions, and the
excellent dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles on 3DG. The
new 3DG–TiO2 nanocomposite materials could find
other potential applications, including energy storage and environmental
decontamination.
