The ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets
of layered transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted great interest as an important
class of materials for fundamental research and technological applications.
Solution-phase processes are highly desirable to produce a large amount
of TMD nanosheets for applications in energy conversion and energy
storage such as catalysis, electronics, rechargeable batteries, and
capacitors. Here, we report a rapid exfoliation by supercritical fluid
processing for the production of MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets. Atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field imaging
reveals high-quality exfoliated MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets with hexagonal structures, which retain their 2H stacking
sequence. The obtained nanosheets were tested
for their electrochemical performance in a hybrid Mg–Li-ion
battery as a proof of functionality. The MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets exhibited the specific capacities of 81 and 55
mA h g–1, respectively, at a current rate of 20
mA g–1.

Introduction
Transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) are an important class
of materials, which are expected to be used for hydrogen storage,
transistors, lubricants, catalysis, batteries, and photovoltaic devices.1−5 TMDs have the chemical composition MX2, where M is a
transition metal (Ti, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W) and X is a chalcogen (e.g.,
S, Se, and Te). The structure of TMDs consists of repeating layers
with strong covalent bonding within layers and weak van der Waals
interaction between layers, which are responsible for their two-dimensional
(2D) physicochemical properties.6−9 Their outstanding properties have been reported in
various applications including photoluminescence, field-effect transistor,
and gas sensor.10−15 The catalytic and electronic properties of these materials are strongly
dependent on the coordination features of metal and chalcogen as well
as the number of layers.16−18 TMDs can be metallic, semimetallic,
or semiconductor,17 and their band gap
varies in the range of 1.2–1.8 eV.18 Furthermore, TMDs could be intergrown with graphene with excellent
electrochemical properties, which make them suitable for versatile
electronic applications including battery electrodes.19−24

TMD nanosheets can be synthesized by top-down or bottom-up
methods.
In bottom-up methods, TMDs can be selectively and epitaxially grown
on metal oxide substrates (MoO3 and SiO2) using
chemical vapor deposition.25−29 In top-down methods, stacked layers were separated apart to yield
single-layer nanosheets. For example, TMDs with high quality and high
crystallinity have been synthesized by micromechanical cleavage.30−33 TMD nanosheets can also be synthesized by the exfoliation of Li
intercalation compounds.34 However, the
disadvantages of these methods are labor consumption, sensitivity
to ambient conditions, and structural deformations and alteration
of electronic properties.35 The direct
liquid-phase exfoliation of bulk TMDs via chemical method, with sonication,
has proved to be a suitable method for the industrial-scale production
of nanosheets.36−41 Few-layer TMD nanosheets could be prepared by direct exfoliation
in certain stabilizing organic solvent or aqueous surfactant solutions
under mild sonication38 or high-shear mixing.41

Recently, supercritical fluid (SCF) process
has been applied for
the production of high-quality, high-yield, and processable graphene
and inorganic nanosheets for technological applications.42−44 This rapid and facile one-pot exfoliation method resulted in a highly
conductive pristine graphene sheet maintaining its original nature.42 Recently, MoS2 has been exfoliated
into nanoscrolls by SCF.45 Here, we extend
our method for the exfoliation of TMD-layered materials into high-quality
nanosheets. We choose the layered materials including MoS2 and MoSe2 as typical TMDs to demonstrate the ability
of our method in the exfoliation of layer compounds. Our procedure
is simple and fast; it involves the direct one-pot exfoliation of
TMD crystals down to few (1–10)-layer nanosheets by the SCF
of dimethylformamide (DMF). The nanosheets were characterized using
atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), revealing
the atomic structure of the monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets with hexagonal structures. The obtained nanosheets
showed good electrochemical performance in a hybrid Mg–Li-ion
battery. The MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets exhibited
the specific capacities of 81 and 55 mA h g–1, respectively,
at a current rate of 20 mA g–1.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Exfoliated Nanosheets
Liquid-phase
exfoliation of layer materials in organic solvents with assisted sonication
is a very useful approach for the preparation of few-layer graphene
and TMDs.36−41 The strong interaction between the solvent and the bulk materials
subsidizes the energy requirement for exfoliation and subsequent solvation.
For the high-yield exfoliation, the solvent that has high diffusivity
and high solvation power is required. The SCF solvent offers advantageous
properties including low interfacial tension, excellent wetting of
surfaces, and high diffusion coefficients, which makes it a superior
medium for diffusion in between the layers of TMDs and its expansion
(Figures 1 and S1). To proceed exfoliation, we dispersed bulk
crystals into a solvent, namely, DMF, and heated above its critical
temperature (377 °C). Figure 1 shows the scheme for the SCF exfoliation of bulk MoS2 and MoSe2 into nanosheets. The exfoliation of
TMDs down to a few layers (1–10 layers) was achieved in SCFs
in a short reaction time of 1 h. Furthermore, this rapid high-yield
exfoliation could produce nanosheets retaining their original pristine
structure without any coordination transformation due to an intercalant-free
processing.

of TMDs by SCFs.

Figure 2 shows the
representative electron microscopy images of the MoS2 nanosheets.
The low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
in Figure 2a indicates
the presence of the large number of thin and monodispersed nanosheets
with a lateral size of 0.5 to 1 μm (see Figure S1 for more TEM images). The high-magnification image
shows the nanosheets with a small number of stacked monolayers (Figure 2b). From TEM images,
the bright and transparent contrast on each particle can be observed,
which is a typical feature of the thin nanosheet nanostructures. The
sample was further studied using high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) to understand
the crystal structure of the MoS2 nanosheets. The fast
Fourier transform (FFT) pattern taken from a nanosheet is shown in
the inset of Figure 2c. The FFT pattern consisting of spots clearly shows hexagonal symmetry.
The pattern can be indexed to the [001] zone axis of the hexagonal
structure, confirming that MoS2 is exfoliated along the ab planes with exposing large {001} facets. HRTEM analysis
of the nanosheet edges reveals that the majority of the nanosheets
consists of few layers. The individual layer edges can be observed
near the outer region of the particle, indicated by the dark arrows
(Figure 2d). The expanse
of layer along the c-axis due to SCF treatment can
be observed, indicated by the white arrows in Figure 2c. The HRTEM image in Figure 2e clearly shows a well-defined hexagonal
symmetry characteristic. The characterization by TEM confirms the
high-quality nanosheets produced by SCF exfoliation. The expected
hexagonally symmetric structure of MoS2 nanosheets is clearly
observed in the atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image in Figure 2f. In HAADF imaging, the intensity
of atomic columns is directly related to the atomic number and the
number of atoms in the atomic column. Thus, in the ADF image of monolayer
MoS2, Mo columns (Z = 42) are expected
to have brighter contrasts, and the dimmer contrasts are sites of
(S2) columns (Z = 16), as indicated by
the overlaid atomic arrays in Figure 2f.25−27,35,46 In the image of multilayer nanosheets, the 2H phase exhibits the
honeycomb pattern, whereas 1T and 3R phases show hexagonal patterns
with a reduced lattice spacing of 1.83 Å,35,40 in which a single atomic column locates around each of the 2D Bravais
lattice points.40 In the ADF image shown
in Figure S2, the honeycomb pattern is
readily identified, indicating the presence of 2H phase. The ADF imaging
clearly indicates that MoS2 retained its original 2H phase
and that the transformation of 2H → 1T phase does not occur
during SCF exfoliation.

HAADF-STEM image of the monolayer in the bottom part. The superimposed
atomic arrays on the inset indicate the locations of atoms.

Because of the similarity in the
crystal structure, it is expected
that the synthesis method can be extended for the exfoliation of other
TMDs. Figure 3 shows
the results from the characterization using electron microscopies
of the MoSe2 nanosheets synthesized by the SCF exfoliation
in DMF. The TEM image (Figure 3a) demonstrates the formation of nanosheets with a lateral
size of 100–500 nm. The exfoliated nanosheets composed of two
to five layers are evidenced from the HRTEM images in Figure 3b,c. Figure 3d shows the selected area electron-diffraction
(SAED) pattern of a nanosheet, corresponding to the [001] zone axis
of the single-crystal MoSe2 structure. The HRTEM image
taken on a portion of the MoSe2 nanosheets displays the
crystal planes of {100} and {010} (Figure 3e). Figure 3f shows the typical HAADF-STEM image of the synthesized
MoSe2 nanosheets. In the ADF image of the monolayer part
of MoSe2, Se2 columns have stronger contrasts
and Mo columns have dimmer contrasts, as indicated by the superimposed
atomic arrays.28,29,47,48 Neighboring Mo and Se2 sites
are separated by 1.98 Å, and the Mo–Mo distance is 5.46
Å. In the image of a multilayer MoSe2, the honeycomb
atomic arrangement and the lattice constants as a = b = 0.33 nm can be observed, suggesting the presence
of 2H stacking sequence in a multilayer MoSe2 (Figure S3).48 In this
image, each column consists of both Mo and Se; thus, every column
shows almost equal contrast.28

The thickness of the exfoliated sheets is characterized using
atomic
force microscopy (AFM). Figure 4 shows the typical tapping-mode AFM images of the exfoliated
MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets deposited on a Si
substrate by drop casting. Generally, the thicknesses of a single-layer
MoS2 and MoSe2 are between 0.7 and 1.0 nm.29,34 The average topographic heights are around 2.7 to 3.2 nm, corresponding
to the thickness of four- or five-layer nanosheets. Statistical analysis
of the thin nanosheets (excluded the unexfoliated particles) using
AFM reveals that 35–40% of the nanosheets comprised four to
five layers (see the size histograms in Figure 4e,f). Additional AFM images with a height
profile can be found in Figure S4.

the
Mo 3d, S 2s, S 2p, and Se 3d spectra of the bulk and exfoliated MoS2 and MoSe2. The Mo 3d peak positions are at the
binding energies of 229.6 and 232.8 eV. MoS2 shows two
characteristic peaks that were fitted with the two distinct doublets
(2p3/2 and 2p1/2) at the binding energies of
162.4 and 163.6 eV. These peaks arise from the 2H phase, and there
are no peaks derived from the 1T phase at a lower binding energy in
both Mo 3d and S 2p spectra.35 In addition,
the peaks observed at the binding energies of 54.7 and 55.5 eV in
the Se 3d spectra can be assigned to the Se 3d5/2 and Se
3d3/2 orbitals of divalent selenide ions (Se2–), indicating that the exfoliated MoSe2 is also derived
from the 2H phase.

Electrochemical Performance
in a Rechargeable Hybrid Mg–Li-Ion
Battery
Recently, magnesium-ion batteries have attracted
great attention as a prospective candidate for an energy storage system
because of the abundance, stability, and high volumetric capacity
of Mg (3832 mA h cm–3).49−55 Because of the slow diffusion of divalent Mg ions into the intercalation
host, most of the cathode materials show low specific capacities or
rapid capacity fade.55−58 The hybrid Mg–Li-ion battery, which involves lithiation/delithiation
at the cathode and magnesiation/demagnesiation at the anode, has improved
the rate capacity and discharge voltage.59,60 At the same time, 2D materials with remarkable electrochemical properties
have emerged as novel electrode materials with high energy and power
densities.61 Thus, several intercalation
compounds showed high specific capacity and good rate performance,
in which the layered TMDs such as TiS2 and MoS2 are promising because of their structural flexibility with a large
layer spacing.62−64 In our previous report, MoS clusters have been found
to be good electrode materials for the Mg–Li-ion battery.51 In this study, the synthesized exfoliated MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets were used as cathodes with
Mg plate anodes for hybrid Mg–Li-ion batteries as a proof of
the functional properties. When the synthesized exfoliated MoS2 was used for an Mg-ion battery in all-phenyl complex (APC)
electrolytes, the electrode showed a capacity of 25 mA h g–1 (Figure S5). However, the capacity was
much higher in hybrid Mg–Li-ion electrolytes. Figure 6a shows the typical charge/discharge
voltage profiles of the MoS2 nanosheets at a current rate
of 20 mA g–1 in the voltage window of 0.2–2.2
V versus Mg/Mg2+. During the first lithiation process (discharge),
the discharge voltage fades rapidly with a discharge capacity of up
to 135 mA h g–1. However, from the second lithiation
process, the electrodes show a capacity of 118 mA h g–1 and remain as high as 81 mA h g–1 after 10 cycles.
The electrochemical performances of MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets are medium among other materials such as MoS2/graphene synthesized by Hsu et al.62 This
is because the electrode materials are pristine nanosheets, without
any modification such as graphene coating. The further work on carbon
coating on the exfoliated nanosheets is required for an enhanced electrode
performance. Figure 6b presents the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of MoS2 nanosheets at a sweeping rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in
the voltage window of 0.2–2.2 V versus Mg/Mg2+.
In the first cycle, the electrode exhibits no clear cathodic peaks,
two anodic peaks at 1.15 and 1.23 V, and one broadened anodic peak
at 1.78 V. From the second cycle, the cathodic peaks were observed
at 0.94 and 1.70 V. The first cathodic peak can be attributed to the
lithiation of MoS2 into LixMoS2 by either intercalation65 or surface reaction (Figure S6).66 In the anodic scans, the oxidation peak can
be ascribed to the conversion reaction: Mo + 2Li2S →
MoS2 + 4 Li.

MoS2 nanosheets in hybrid Mg–Li-ion batteries tested
in the potential
range of 0.2–2.2 V vs Mg/Mg2+. (a) Typical charge/discharge
profiles at a current rate of 20 mA g–1 and (b)
CV curves of the cell containing MoS2 nanosheets.

There have been many reports on
the electrochemical performance
of MoS2; however, the electrochemical properties of MoSe2 are less known.67,68 In this report, the
electrochemical properties of MoSe2 nanosheets for the
Mg–Li hybrid battery were investigated for the first time.
The first five charge/discharge curves of the MoSe2 nanosheets
at a current rate of 20 mA g–1 with a cutoff voltage
window of 0.2 to 2.2 V versus Mg/Mg2+ are shown in Figure 7a. During the first
lithiation process (discharge), the MoSe2 nanosheet electrode
possesses one voltage plateau at 1.03 V versus Mg/Mg2+.
In the subsequent lithiation process (charge), the MoSe2 nanosheets exhibited two voltage plateaus at 1.30 and 1.10 V versus
Mg/Mg2+, indicating two-step lithium intercalation. The
first CV cycle of the cell containing MoSe2 nanosheets
shows one cathodic peak at 0.97 V versus Mg/Mg2+ and two
anodic peaks at 1.17 and 1.39 V (Figure 7b). The CV curve of the second cathodic sweep
shows two reduction peaks at 1.27 and 1.04 V.

of the synthesized MoSe2 nanosheets in hybrid Mg–Li-ion
batteries tested in the potential
range of 0.2–2.2 V vs Mg/Mg2+. (a) Typical first
charge/discharge profiles at a current rate of 20 mA g–1 and (b) CV curves of the cell containing MoS2 nanosheets.

The MoSe2 nanosheets
exhibited an initial discharge
and a charge capacity of 75 and 25 mA h g–1 at a
current rate of 20 mA g–1, respectively. The irreversible
capacity with a low Coulombic efficiency in the first three cycles
may be due to the lithium trapping inside of the lattice and the formation
of a solid electrolyte interface layer. The discharge capacities increased
up to 82 mA h g–1 after three cycles. As shown in Figure 7a, the discharge
capacity of nanosheets could be maintained at 55 mA h g–1 after several cycles.

Figure S7 shows the typical charge/discharge
profiles of the MoS2 bulk materials at a current rate of
20 mA g–1 as a control sample. The bulk materials
exhibited higher discharge/charge capacities with a capacity of 210
mA h g–1 compared to 81 mA h g–1 of the nanosheet materials. Figure S8 presents the charge/discharge curves of the cells containing MoSe2 nanosheets at a discharge rate of 20 mA g–1. Notably, the nanosheets delivered lower capacity; they exhibited
a discharge capacity of 55 mA h g–1, whereas the
bulk material delivered the capacity of 93 mA h g–1. The performance of MoS2 nanosheets is worse than that
of the bulk material because of the formation of various kinds of
intrinsic defects under SCF, which may trap Li-ions and inhibit the
intercalation reaction. The investigation using atomic-resolved ADF
imaging reveals that the obtained exfoliated nanosheets contain vacancies
and antisite defects and undergo edge reconstruction. The work is
now in progress.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
an SCF process for the exfoliation of MoS2 and MoSe2. This rapid and facile one-pot exfoliation
method resulted in the high-quality pristine nanosheets maintaining
their original stacking nature with a thickness of three to six layers
and a lateral size of 500–1000 nm. Atomic-resolution HAADF
imaging reveals the atomic structure of monolayer and few-layer MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets with hexagonal structures.
As a proof of functionality, the obtained nanosheets were tested for
their electrochemical performance in a hybrid Mg–Li-ion battery.
The MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets exhibited the
specific capacities of 81 and 55 mA h g–1, respectively,
at a current rate of 20 mA g–1. This SCF processing
can be readily extended to the exfoliation of TMDs and controlled
synthesis of lateral heterojunctions within monolayers or vertical
heterostructures of the TMDs.

Experimental Section
Synthesis Method
MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets were directly exfoliated
by one-pot supercritical solvent
method at 400 °C with a reaction time of 1 h. All SCF exfoliations
were performed in a hastelloy reactor with a maximum volume of 10
mL. Typically, 20 mg of bulk crystals (MoS2, Aldrich, USA
and MoSe2, Alfa Aesar, USA) was dispersed into 5 mL of
DMF by low-power sonication (AS ONE US cleaner, US-4R, 40 kHz, 160
W) for 5 min. The obtained suspension was transferred to a batch reactor
vessel, and the sealed reactor was heated at 400 °C for 1 h in
a specially designed tube furnace (AKICO, Japan) (Figure 1). Then, the reactors were
allowed to cool to room temperature by cool water quenching. The exfoliated
solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 min using a AS ONE centrifuge
(Hsiangtai Co., Ltd.). The supernatant was collected, and the sediment
containing unexfoliated, thick flakes was removed. Then, the supernatant
was centrifuged at 30 000 rpm for 1 h using a Himac CP85β
(Hitachi) instrument. The nanosheets were collected, and the supernatant
was discarded. The fresh DMF was added to the obtained powder, and
the solution was sonicated and centrifuged again to obtain clean exfoliated
nanosheets. Finally, the obtained specimen was dried at 60 °C
in vacuum for 1 day.

Material Characterization
The morphology
of the particles
was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM,
Hitachi S-4800 with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, EDS) at
an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. TEM (Hitachi H7650, 100 kV) and HRTEM
(TOPCOM EM-002B, 200 kV) analyses were conducted. The samples for
TEM and STEM analyses were prepared by placing the nanosheet materials
onto holey carbon TEM grids. The materials were dispersed into ethanol
and then dropped onto a Cu microgrid coated with a holey carbon film,
followed by the evaporation of ethanol at 60 °C. HAADF imaging
was performed on an aberration-corrected JEM-ARM200F, equipped with
a cold field emission electron gun, operated with 200 kV. The camera
length is 6 cm. The convergence semiangle for the incident probe was
set at 29 mrad, and a probe current of about 34 pA was used. Most
of the ADF images were collected for a half-angle range of 90–370
mrad.

The AFM measurements were recorded with SPA400 (SII Nanotechnology
Inc). The nanosheet suspensions were applied directly on a thin native
oxide on the Si(100) substrate. After drying the substrate in a vacuum,
the measurements were recorded in air at ambient temperature and ambient
pressure. XPS measurements were recorded using a ULVAC PHI 500 (Versa
Probe II) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray
source.

Electrochemical Measurement
The electrochemical performance
of MoS2 and MoSe2 was investigated using coin-type
cells (CR2032). The working electrodes were composed of 80 wt % active
materials, 10 wt % PTFE [poly(tetrafluoroethylene)] as a binder, and
10 wt % acetylene black. These materials were ground by conventional
agar mortar to make an electrode paste. The prepared paste was spread
uniformly, rolling into a sheet and then dried in a vacuum oven for
4 h at 160 °C. The cathode sheet was punched into circular discs
and cut into wafers (7 mm in diameter, 0.025 mm in thickness, and
5–6 mg). The tested cell was assembled inside of an argon-filled
glovebox. For electrochemical measurements, the cell was composed
of a magnesium metal counter, reference electrodes, and an MoX2 positive electrode. The anode and reference electrodes were
separated by a microporous polypropylene film.

APC electrolyte
was prepared in an Ar-filled glovebox by the addition of anhydrous
AlCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) to anhydrous tetrahydrofuran
(THF, Kanto Chemical Inc., 99.9%), followed by mixing with 2 M PhMgCl
solution in THF (Sigma-Aldrich, 100%) and extra THF to obtain 0.4
M APC [Mg2Cl3]+[AlPh2Cl2]−/THF.51 The
addition of anhydrous LiCl salts (Kanto Chemical Inc., 99%) into the
0.4 M APC electrolyte under stirring was carried out to make 0.4 M
LiCl. The charge/discharge cycling was performed galvanostatically
between 0.2 and 2.2 V versus Mg/Mg2+ for MoS2 on multichannel battery testers (Hokuto Denko, Japan) at various
charge/discharge rates of 20 mA g–1. Current densities
and specific capacities were calculated based on the weight of MoX2 in the electrode.
