A new,
rapid, and cost-effective method for synthesizing hollow
microspheres (HMSs) of cobalt oxide (Co3O4)
using the phloroglucinol–formaldehyde gel route is reported
here. Further, the synthesized hollow Co3O4 microspheres
were investigated as an anode material for Li-ion batteries. The Co3O4 hollow spheres exhibited excellent electrochemical
performance and cycling stability, for example, a capacity of 915
mA h g–1 was obtained at 1 C rate over 350 cycles.
The material also exhibited good performance at high rates, viz.,
capacities of 500, 350, and 250 mA h g–1 at 10 C,
25 C, and 50 C, respectively, with good capacity retention over 500
cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of Co3O4 can be ascribed to the porous nanoarchitecture that
provides a short diffusion length for Li+ ions and high
electrolyte percolation in the porous structure. Additionally, the
thin porous wall of the nanocages provides an effective way to overcome
the issues associated with the volume change occurring during Li charge/discharge.
The conversion of Co3O4 into Co upon discharge
was also probed by measuring the magnetic properties.

1 Introduction
Rapid
depletion of fossil fuels, global warming, and increased
pollution levels have necessitated energy turnaround scenario to seek
alternative renewable energy sources for the sustainable future. Various
energy conversion/storage technologies have been rigorously developed,
and among them, rechargeable batteries have gained much of the attention
as they can be used in portable devices as well as for automobile
and grid applications. Because of their high energy density, in addition
to their long cycle life and light weight, Li-ion batteries are becoming
the obvious choice for energy storage.1−5 Recently, significant progress has been made in Li-ion battery technology,
both in terms of identifying new electrode materials and new mechanisms,
pushing the realizable limits of energy density and power density
further. Recently, it has been discovered that metal oxides, when
reduced to nanosize, exhibit remarkable reactivity with lithium, usually
referred to as “conversion reaction”, showing high capacity.6,7 For example, nanostructured cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is expected to exhibit a high capacity (about 890 mA h g–1), which is twice that of the graphite anode used in commercial Li-ion
batteries. However, practical use of Co3O4 electrodes
is still hindered by poor cycling stability and rate capability.8,9 To overcome such issues, several efforts have been devoted to prepare
nanoarchitectured materials with different morphologies including
one-dimensional nanowires, nanobelts,10 nanorods,11 nanoneedles,12 and nanotubes,13 two-dimensional
nanosheets,14 three-dimensional architectures,15 nanoparticles,16 and
nanocubes.17 Similarly, hollow porous structured
nanocage materials that combine the advantages of both nanothickness
and void space have attracted increased attention for use in Li-ion
battery applications. Such a hollow architecture enables increased
electrode–electrolyte contact area and also provides additional
space to overcome the strain associated with the Li insertion–deinsertion
process.18−20 Recently, we have used a resorcinol (R)–formaldehyde
(F) gel method to prepare SnO2 hollow microspheres (HMSs)
that exhibited superior electrochemical properties.21

Carbon aerogels or hollow structures can be prepared
using a resorcinol
(1,3-dihydroxybenzene) and formaldehyde mixture.21,22 The aqueous mediated polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde
gives a cross-linked polymeric gel (RF gel).22−25 However, because of the water
content, the RF aquagel is not suitable for supercritical drying as
it takes a long time to dry, so a tedious solvent exchange step is
required while making the carbon aerogels or hollow porous structures.26,27 The production procedure for carbon aerogels or hollow porous structures
can be effectively simplified in terms of both the rate of polymerization
as well as the sol–gel drying process by using formaldehyde
and alcohol-soluble phloroglucinol (Phl) instead of resorcinol.26−33 The higher degree of polymerization of phloroglucinol over resorcinol
is due to its enhanced electron density in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th ring
positions.32,34 The resulting carbon aerogels
possess a higher surface area and uniform porous structure.30−36 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the
synthesis of metal oxide porous structures using the phloroglucinol–formaldehyde
(P–F) gel method, which is also a rapid and cost-effective
process. In this work, for the first time, we report the synthesis
of Co3O4 HMSs by using the P–F gel method.
We further show that the Co3O4 HMSs, when tested
as an anode, exhibited fast charging capability (50 C rate) with good
capacity retention over 500 cycles owing to their hollow and porous
morphology. The superior electrochemical performance and the easy
synthesis of the Co3O4  HMSs suggest their
practical use in LIBs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Phase Formation and Morphology
Figure 1a shows the powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the product formed after initial
carbonization of the gel under an argon atmosphere. The reflections
in the pattern could be indexed based on the crystalline cubic system
of cobalt (ICDD PDF Card No. 00-015-0806). The XRD pattern of the
final product obtained after heating in an oxygen atmosphere is shown
in Figure 1b, and all
of the reflections were indexed based on the standard pattern of cubic
spinel Co3O4 (ICDD PDF Card No. 00-042-1467).
These results clearly show the formation of the Co/C composite during
the initial heating of the cobalt/P–F resin under an argon
atmosphere, which was oxidized to Co3O4 during
the subsequent oxygen annealing process.

Figure 1 Powder XRD patterns of
(a) cobalt/C composite prepared by calcination
of CoCl2/P–F gel in argon atmosphere at 500 °C
and (b) Co3O4 HMSs prepared by annealing Cobalt/C
composite in oxygen at 500 °C.

The morphology of the as-prepared Co3O4 HMSs
was analyzed by FESEM and compared with that of the Co/C composite. Figure 2a shows the spherical
morphology of the Co/C composite particles. The FESEM images of the
oxygen-annealed sample (Co3O4 HMSs) are shown
as Figure 2b,c, and
they reveal that the final product is composed of porous hollow spheres.
It can be seen that (Figure 2c) the particle surface is, in turn, made up of interconnected
nanoparticles. The porous nature of the shell and its formation through
aggregation of smaller nanoparticles were further supported by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2d). On the basis of the morphological studies, we propose
the initial formation of a trough/pit on the surface of the Co/C hollow
sphere, which on further heating in an oxygen atmosphere, opens up
due to the stress developed during the annealing process as well as
due to the escape of CO2 from inside21,31,38 as shown in Scheme S1.

of carbon-coated Co/C composite), and (b, c) Co3O4 HMSs at 50 and 200k× magnifications, (d) TEM image of Co3O4 HMSs.

Further, the Co/C composite and Co3O4 HMSs
were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
(Figure S1a,b). The absorption bands in
the regions of 800 and 1050–1125 cm–1 could
be assigned to the Co–OH, −CH2, and C–O
stretching vibrations.39 A small amount
of cobalt oxide is present in the Co/C sample, as understood from
the peak at around 519 cm–1. The band at 1620 cm–1 represents the bending vibration mode of water molecules.39 The broad and sharp band between 3392 and 3555
cm–1 could be assigned to the O–H stretching
modes of water and surface hydroxyl groups.39 After annealing the Co/C composite at 500 °C for 2 h in an
oxygen atmosphere, strong peaks at 574 and 670 cm–1 are observed, which are characteristic absorption peaks of the cobalt–oxygen
(Co–O) bond.39 The broad peak at
3417 cm–1 and the shoulder peak at 1632 cm–1 are typical of O–H vibrations due to  adsorbed moisture.39

The Raman spectra of the Co/C composite
(Figure S2a) show two broad peaks: the peak at 1585 cm–1 [G band] indicates sp2 graphitic carbon, whereas the
band at 1345 cm–1 [D band] corresponds to sp3 disordered carbon.40Figure S2b shows the Raman spectra of the Co3O4 HMSs, revealing four Raman active modes at 470
(A1g), 510 (Eg), 608 (2F2g), and 675 cm–1 (A1g).41,42 The Raman mode at 675 cm–1 (A1g) is
due to the atoms at octahedral sites whereas the Eg and
F2g modes can be assigned to atoms at the tetrahedral site
and octahedral oxygen.41,42

Thermal stability and carbon
content were evaluated using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) by heating the dried precursor in air. TGA for the
Co/C composite (Figure S3a) shows a weight
loss of 18–20% below 100 °C, which can be assigned to
the removal of adsorbed moisture.43,44 A weight loss
of 65% observed between 350 and 450 °C is mainly due to the removal
of carbon as CO2.43 No weight
loss was observed in the case of the Co3O4 sample
(Figure S3b).

2.2 Growth
Mechanism of Co3O4 HMSs and Their Characterization
To understand the growth
mechanism, the product formed during the synthesis was characterized
using powder XRD (Figure S4). Initially,
the Co/C composite was formed by heating CoCl2/P–F
gel at 500 °C in an argon atmosphere, as evidenced by powder
XRD. The reflections in the XRD pattern were identified as due to
the (111), (200), and (220) planes of cobalt (ICDD PDF Card No. 00-015-0806).
Further heat treatment was carried out between 200 and 500 °C
under an oxygen atmosphere to form Co3O4. When
the Co/C composite was heated at 200 °C in an oxygen atmosphere,
the XRD pattern showed the evolution of the CoO phase (ICDD PDF Card
No. 01-078-0431), in addition to the major reflections of the cobalt
phase. At 300 °C, CoO was the major phase, and the reflections
corresponding to Co became less intense, indicating that most of the
cobalt phase was oxidized. The Co3O4 phase (ICDD
PDF Card No. 00-042-1467) started to appear when the temperature was
increased to 400 °C, and finally, the pure Co3O4 phase was obtained at 500 °C. It should be noted that
sample soak time was kept at 2 h at each of the above-mentioned temperatures.

The formation mechanism of carbon xerogels using the polymer-assisted
phenolic–formaldehyde gel method is well understood,22−36 and it can be further extended to the synthesis of nanostructured
metal oxides using metal–carbon xerogels. Co3O4 HMS formation can be explained based on the following three
steps. In the first step, a gel was formed by the addition of
phloroglucinol, triblock copolymer (F127), formaldehyde, and the metal
precursor.27,29,31 The second step was drying of the formed gel, and the third step
involved carbonization followed by oxidation of the metal–carbon
composite.27 So, the first step involves
polymerization of phloroglucinol (Phl) and formaldehyde in an ethanol
medium in the presence of concentrated HCl catalyst.24,27,29,31−33 Further introduction of triblock copolymer (F127)
to the phlorogluconic resin will facilitate the formation of a mesoporous
structure through hydrogen bonding.29−33 Meanwhile, the Co2+ ions are chelated
with hydroxyl groups (−OH) of the phloroglucinol moiety in
the P–F polymer chain.

The second step is drying of the
wet gel (cobalt-P–F Gel)
in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 5–6 h. The final step
involves carbonization of the dried gel under an argon atmosphere.
The heating rate and carbonization temperature were also found to
be important in determining the textural and electrochemical properties
of carbon aerogels.26,27 To investigate the effect of
temperature on morphology, the dried gel was carbonized between 200
and 500 °C, and the morphologies of the resultant products were
examined by FESEM. Figure S5a shows that
spherical particles (1–2 μm) of Co/C composite were formed
when the CoCl2/P–F precursor was heated at intermediate
temperatures of 200–300 °C under an argon atmosphere. Figure S5b shows the FESEM image of the Co/C
composite obtained after heat treatment at 500 °C in an argon
atmosphere. Further, the Co/C composite was heated in an oxygen atmosphere
between 200 and 500 °C to obtain the Co3O4 phase, and Figure S5c–i shows
the corresponding FESEM images. Figure S5c–g shows the initiation and propagation of micron-sized hollow spheres.
Further, Figure S5h,i shows the FESEM images
of the final product obtained at 500 °C, which exhibited a hollow
spherical structure.

Carbon acts as a sacrificial template for
the formation of Co3O4 HMSs. The approach is
based on the initial formation
of micrometer sized P–F spherical gels through self-assembly
along with the incorporation of the cobalt precursor. Gel formation
is essential in obtaining Co3O4 hollow spheres
through the creation of a sacrificial carbon template. Carbonization
of the dried gel under an argon atmosphere results in the formation
of spherical particles (1–2 μm) of Co/C composite. Formation
of Co3O4 hollow spheres from the Co/C composite
can be explained as follows: during the initial low temperature oxidation,
the surface oxidizes to form a mechanically strong outer surface layer.
The trench formation on the Co/C spherical wall during the oxidation
is due to the development of stress through the formation and sintering
of Co3O4 particles. On further heat treatment
at 500 °C, such weak regions will rupture, relieving the stress.
In the meantime, the interior carbonaceous material decomposes to
form gaseous CO2 that upon release, results in a hollow
interior. The escape of gaseous product from the interior will further
facilitate the propagation of cracks along the weak regions of the
shell wall resulting in the formation of a cage-like structure. The
escape of CO2 also makes the surface highly porous. Any
cobalt species present in the core will move to the surface during
sintering.

2.3 Evaluation of Electrochemical
Properties
The electrochemical performance of the Co3O4  HMSs as an anode material for Li-ion batteries
was investigated
by cyclic voltammetry. Figure 3a shows the cyclic voltammetric (CV) data for the initial
four cycles with the scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in
the potential range 0.001–3.0 V versus Li+/Li. The
reactivity of Co3O4 with Li during the electrochemical
reduction and oxidation process is given as follows:  Hence, in the CV plot, during the first cycle,
a well-defined cathodic peak is observed at 0.68 V and an anodic peak
is observed at 2.08 V versus Li+/Li. In the first cathodic
scan, a peak at around 0.68 V corresponds to the initial reduction
of cobalt oxide to cobalt metal (Co3O4 to Co)
accompanied with the formation of amorphous Li2O.45,46 During the anodic scan, a broad peak observed at around 2.08 V can
be assigned to the oxidation of Co to Co3O4 and
decomposition of Li2O.46 The
shoulder peak at around 1.1 V can be assigned to the formation of
the partially irreversible solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.45−49 As reported earlier,45,47,49 the organic component of the SEI layer can dissolve/reform reversibly,
however, the inorganic component formation is irreversible. Upon further
cycling, the cathodic peak exhibited a shift from 0.68 to 1.13 V due
to the polarization of the electrode46,49,50 and remained constant, revealing good cycling stability.

voltammograms of Co3O4 HMSs in
the voltage range of 3.0–0.001 V at 0.1 mV s–1 scan rate, (b–e) discharge/charge profiles of Co3O4 at different rates: (b) 1 C rate, (c) 10 C rate, (d)
25 C rate, and (e) 50 C rate. (f) Rate capability performance of Co3O4 HMSs (0.2–50 C rate).

Further, to establish the cycling stability of
the Co3O4 HMSs as a Li-ion battery anode, galvanostatic
discharge/charge
tests were carried out for several cycles. Figure 3b–e shows the discharge/charge profiles
of mesoporous Co3O4 HMSs between 0.001 and 3.0
V versus Li+/Li at 1 C, 10 C, 25 C, and 50 C rates. At
1 C rate, the discharge capacities were 1635, 860, 964, and 915 mA
h g–1 for the 1st, 100th, 200th, and 350th cycles,
respectively. Even at 10 C rate, the delivered discharge capacities
were 692, 429, 457, 466, 467, and 500 mA h g–1 for
the 1st, 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th, and 500th cycles, respectively.
At 25 C rate, the corresponding discharge capacities were 599, 320,
328, 340, 342, and 350 mA h g–1 and at 50 C rate,
the capacities were 475, 234, 232, 230, 232, and 250 mA h g–1 (for the 1st, 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th, and 500th cycles, respectively).
For practical applications of porous/hollow/nanomaterials, the tap
density is one of the crucial parameters that impact the volumetric
capacity as well as the volumetric energy densities. The tap density
of the synthesized Co3O4 HMSs was measured to
be around 0.97 g cm–3. Therefore, the volumetric
capacities of the Co3O4 HMSs at different current
rates were 945 mA h cm–3 (at 1 C), 221 mA h cm–3 (at 10 C), 165 mA h cm–3 (at 25
C), and 113 mA h cm–3 (at 50 C), which correspond
to volumetric energy densities of 1134 Wh L–1 (1
C), 266 Wh L–1 (10 C), 198 Wh L–1 (25 C), and 135 Wh L–1 (50 C), respectively.

Co3O4 HMSs exhibit excellent rate capability
at various discharge rates (0.2–50 C), and the results are
shown in Figure 3f.
After cycling at higher rates, the cell was subjected to cycling again
at lower rates to investigate the stability of the Co3O4 HMSs for varying current rates. It was observed that (Figure 3f) the cell capacity
reverts back to the initial capacity, confirming that Co3O4 HMSs exhibit good rate capability, a desirable property
for power applications.

The cycling performance and the Coulombic
efficiency of the Co3O4 HMSs sample are shown
in Figure 4a–d.
At 1 C rate, the first discharge
and charge capacities (Figure 4a) are about 1624 and 920 mA h g–1, and
the Coulombic efficiency (the ratio between charge and discharge capacities)
for the first cycle is 56.2%. The reason for the initial irreversible
capacity loss can be attributed to the irreversible SEI formation
and to the large volume change occurring during charge–discharge.51−55 From the second cycle onwards, the capacity of the electrode gradually
decreased, and at the 15th cycle, it reached a value of 376 mA h g–1. However, the Coulombic efficiency remained between
97 and 100% for several hundred cycles (Figure 4a).52,55 It is possible that
the SEI formation continues for the initial few cycles, accounting
for the continuous capacity loss and that afterwards, the electrode
demonstrated a stable cyclability.45,54,55

Figure 4 (a–d) Long cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency
of
Co3O4 HMSs at different rates: (a) 1 C, (b)
10 C, (c) 25 C, and (d) 50 C. The cells were cycled between 0.001
and 3.0 V.

In Figure 4a, it
can be noted that from the 15th cycle onwards, the capacity started
to increase, and it stabilized at 895 mA h g–1 after
the 110th cycle. A similar behavior of increasing capacity during
charge/discharge cycles was also reported for a few other oxide materials
as well.31,52−61 The initial capacity drop was ascribed to irreversible SEI formation
through the degradation of the electrolyte.45,51,53−58 The increasing trend in capacity is usually attributed to the reversible
growth of a polymeric gel-like film on the electrode surface.31,51,55,59−63 At 1 C rate, even after 350 cycles, a discharge capacity of 915
mA h g–1 was observed, which is slightly higher
than the theoretical capacity value of Co3O4 (890 mA h g–1), and this can be attributed to
the activation of the electrode during long cycling.31,53,54 The high reversible capacity
beyond the theoretical capacity can probably be attributed to the
porous nature of the nanocages. In nanostructured systems, the interfacial
lithium storage may play an important role in the overall capacity.
The pores within the nanocages can provide additional sites for lithium
storage, resulting in a higher capacity compared to the theoretical
capacity.45,48,52−55 The other explanation for the additional capacity observed in transition
metal oxides is that additional lithium storage is possible between
grain boundaries of Li2O and metal particles formed during
discharge.20,45,52−55

At the end of the 350th cycle, the capacity of the Co3O4 anode was around 915 mA h g–1 at
1 C rate (Figure 4a).
Such a stable capacity retention can be attributed to the hollow porous
nature of the Co3O4 HMSs. Similarly, Figure 4d shows that at 50
C rate, after the 500th cycle, the sample exhibited a capacity retention
of 87% relative to the 1st cycle capacity. On the basis of the above
results, it may be envisaged that Co3O4 HMSs
exhibit an ultralong cycle life that would endorse their application
as an anode material for LIBs. The superior performance is due to
their morphology that provides sufficient buffer space to accommodate
volume changes during lithium insertion–deinsertion.21,40,44,55,62,63 In addition,
the high surface area and the hierarchical porous network structure
render a short path length for lithium diffusion during insertion/extraction
enabling high rate performance.49,55,64−73

To ascertain the excellent performance of the Co3O4 HMSs prepared in the present work, a comparison of
the electrochemical
performance of the Co3O4 HMSs with that of other
previously reported Co3O4 materials was made
and is listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information).
Further, we compared the electrochemical behavior of the Co3O4 HMSs with that of commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles at 1 C rate, and the results are shown in Figure 5. Although the Co3O4 HMSs showed a capacity retention of 99% at 1
C rate (915 mA h g–1), commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles showed only 2% capacity retention (20
mA h g–1) after 350 cycles. The superior performance
of the Co3O4 HMSs can be attributed to the hollow
structure that provides sufficient contact between the electrolyte
and the active material, and facilitates the rapid electron transfer
due to small diffusion length.21,44,45,55 Also, the hollow structure can
alleviate the strain developed due to volume change during the charge–discharge
process, enabling good structural stability.21,40,44,49,53

Figure 5 Comparison of electrochemical cycling performances of
Co3O4 HMSs and commercial Co3O4 nanoparticles
at 1 C rate.

The superior transport
kinetics of the Co3O4 HMSs was also confirmed
by electrochemical impedance measurements. Figure 6 shows the Nyquist
plots after completing the 2nd, 50th, 100th, 200th, and 350th discharge
cycles. Impedance plots show a semicircle in the mid frequency region,
which can be assigned to charge transfer resistance (Rct).21 The inclined straight
line in the low-frequency region can be attributed to Warburg diffusion
of Li+ ions into the bulk of the active material.43 Even after 350 cycles at 1 C rate, the charge
transfer resistance of the electrode had not increased much, confirming
the highly reversible lithium storage capability of the Co3O4 HMSs. Further, we compared the charge transfer resistance
of the Co3O4 HMS and commercial Co3O4 samples before and after cycling (Figure 7). The charge transfer resistance
of the Co3O4 HMS electrode is lower than that
of the commercial Co3O4 electrode.

of the spectra.

The conversion reaction between Li and Co3O4 resulting in the formation of cobalt particles during
discharge
was qualitatively monitored by measuring changes in the magnetic properties
of the pristine and discharged samples (ex situ magnetic studies).
The zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) curves of Co3O4 are shown in Figure 8a. With decreasing temperature, the magnetization
increased up to 33 K, and then decreased upon further cooling to 5
K, showing a cusp around 33 K. This behavior of temperature-dependent
magnetization is typical of antiferromagnetic ordering. The observed
Néel temperature of 33 K is similar to the values reported
in the case of Co3O4 nanoparticles and double-shell
hollow particles.74,75 The M–H data measured at 300, 30, and 5 K are shown in Figure 8b, and the data are
linear without any saturation. A small hysteresis curvature observed
at 5 K with a coercieve field (Hc) of
146 Oe indicates the antiferromagnetic ground state.75 The magnetization and M–H results of the discharged sample at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 8c,d. The temperature-dependent magnetization result of the discharge
sample is different from that of the pristine sample. The ZFC and
FC data (Figure 8c)
show a deviation below 250 K, indicating that the sample behaves as
a superparamagnet above that temperature. The M–H curve (Figure 8d) measured at 5 K shows saturation at a field of less than
1 T with a high Hc (986 Oe), and this
is similar to the reported value of colloidal Co nanoparticles, revealing
the ferromagnetic nature.76

magnetization of (a) pristine and (c) discharged
sample obtained after discharging. The M–H traces of (b) pristine and (d) discharged sample measured
at different temperatures, and the insets show a closer view of the
results.

To understand the origin of the
long cycle capacity retention,
post-mortem SEM analyses of electrodes cycled at 10 C, 25 C, and 50
C rates were carried out after completing 500 charge–discharge
cycles. For this, coin cells were dismantled inside an argon-filled
glove box and the electrodes were thoroughly washed with fresh electrolyte
(ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)). The morphology
of the as-prepared (Figure 9a) and electrochemically cycled (Figure 9b–d) electrode material was examined
using FESEM. It was found that the hollow nanocage-like morphology
was retained even after 500 cycles at 10 C, 25 C, and 50 C rates.

3 Conclusions
We have synthesized Co3O4 HMSs using a cost-effective
phloroglucinol–formaldehyde (P–F) gel method. When used
as an anode for Li-ion batteries, the Co3O4 HMSs
showed excellent cycling stability and high capacity retention over
350 cycles at 1 C rate. The material also exhibited good performance
at higher rates (such as 10 C, 25 C, and 50 C) with good capacity
retention over 500 cycles. The origin of such remarkable behavior
can be attributed to the hollow morphology of the particles that provides
ample electrode/electrolyte contact and a shorter diffusion length
for Li as well as accommodating volume changes during intercalation/deintercalation.
Further, magnetic measurements on pristine and discharged samples
revealed the conversion of Co3O4 into Co upon
discharge, as evidenced by changes in the magnetic properties.

The synthesis of Co3O4 HMSs was carried out by adopting the facile phloroglucinol–formaldehyde
(P–F) gel method reported elsewhere.30−33 In a typical synthesis, 2 g of
CoCl2·6H2O (Merck Chemicals), 1 g of phloroglucinol
dihydrate (Across Organics Ltd), 1 g of F127 triblock copolymer (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 2–3 mL of 37% formaldehyde (Rankem Chemicals) were dissolved
in 25 mL of ethanol. This solution was vigorously stirred for 30 min
to get a clear solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 1–2
by adding a few drops of concentrated HCl, followed by heating the
solution in a water bath at 80 °C for 3 h to obtain cobalt/phloroglucinol–formaldehyde
(Co-P–F) gel. The gel was dried in a hot air oven at 100 °C
for 5 h. Subsequently, the dried gel was transferred to a tubular
furnace and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h under flowing argon followed
by heating under an oxygen atmosphere for 2 h at 500 °C to obtain
the final product of Co3O4 HMSs.

4.2 Material Characterization
The synthesized
products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) using
a Bruker D8 Advance Da Vinci diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphologies of the products
obtained at various stages were analyzed by using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM; Carl Zeiss SUPRA55VP) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM; Technai-20 G2). Raman spectra were recorded
in the wavelength range of 200–2500 cm–1 using
a Renishaw Laser Raman microscope. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of the samples were recorded using a spectrometer (Bruker,
Optick GmbH) by the KBr pellet technique. Thermal analysis of samples
was carried out in air (heating rate 5 °C min–1) using a thermogravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH, model STA449F3). The
temperature-dependent magnetization and M–H measurements of the pristine and discharged samples were
made using a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Dynacool,
Quantum Design) as in our earlier work.37 The magnetization was measured under zero field cooled (ZFC) and
field cooled (FC) warming conditions in the temperature range between
5 and 380 K with an applied field of 100 Oe. The M–H measurements were made at room temperature
and at low temperatures in the magnetic field between −9 and
+9 T. For magnetic measurements on the electrochemically discharged
sample,37 Swagelok-type cells were opened
inside an Ar-filled glove box. The collected samples were washed with
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) a few times and the dried samples were packed
in a capsule for magnetic measurements.

4.3 Electrochemical
Properties 
The electrochemical performance of the Co3O4 HMS samples was evaluated galvaniostatically
by using a VMP3Z (Biologic)
multichannel battery testing system. The working electrode was prepared
by mixing active material Co3O4 HMSs, SP carbon,
and poly(vinylidene fluoride) as binder in a weight ratio of 70:20:10. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone was used as a blending solvent. The
slurry was coated on Cu foil of thickness 9 μm and dried at
120 °C for 12 h under vacuum. CR2032-type coin cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glove box (MBRAUN) with Li as the counter electrode
and Celgard-2400 as separator. 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate
(EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (2:1:2 by volume)
was used as electrolyte. The typical active material loading was 0.5–1.5
mg cm–2. For comparison purpose, cells were also
made with commercial Co3O4 powders (Sigma-Aldrich
chemicals, particle size 50–70 nm) under identical conditions.
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) analyses were performed at a scan rate of
0.1 mV s–1 between 0.001 and 3.0 V (Li+/Li). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies were carried
out with a perturbation of 20 mV amplitude over a frequency range
of 400 kHz to 50 mHz.
