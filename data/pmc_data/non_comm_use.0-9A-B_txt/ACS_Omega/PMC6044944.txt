Efficient
Na ion intercalation/deintercalation in the semigraphitic
lattice of a hard carbon derived from the walnut shell is demonstrated.
High-temperature (1000 °C) pyrolysis of walnut shells under an
inert atmosphere yields a hard carbon with a low surface area (59
m2 g–1) and a large interplanar c axis separation of 0.39–0.36 nm as compared to
0.32 nm for graphite, suitable for Na ion intercalation/deintercalation.
A stable reversible capacity of 257 mAh g–1 is observed
at a current density of 50 mA g–1 for such nutshell-derived
carbon (NDC) with an impressive rate performance. No loss of electrochemical
performance is observed for high current cycling (100 mA g–1 → 2 A g–1 → 100 mA g–1). Additionally, the NDC shows remarkably stable electrochemical
performance up to 300 charge–discharge cycles at 100 mA g–1 with a minimal drop in capacity.

Introduction
Na ion batteries are emerging as a new
cost-effective alternative
to Li ion batteries.1,2 Similarity with Li chemistry and
natural abundance make Na a promising successor to Li. Huge reservoirs
of Na in the form of minerals like rock salt, sodalite, and suitable
feldspars are present in the Earth’s crust. The significantly
high Earth abundance of Na vis-à-vis Li (2.5% for Na vs 0.0017%
for Li)3 makes it an economical and commercially
viable alternative to Li, provided the electrochemical performance
is maintained.4−6 Because Na and Li occupy the same group in the periodic
table, their electrochemistry is expected to be more or less similar.
Therefore, enormous work done on Li ion batteries in the past can
be the guiding force for future progress in Na ion batteries. The
ongoing research in Na ion batteries involves the discovery of efficient
cathode and anode materials to lead the technology toward commercialization.3−6

Replication of the Li chemistry has already been a successful
ploy
for the cathode.7,8 Binary oxides, phosphates, and
pyrophosphates of transition metals with Na (in analogy with Li) have
come up as excellent cathode materials. So far, materials like NaFeO2, NaCoO2, NaMnO4, NaNiO2,
Na3V2(PO4)3, and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 are
reported to be best-performing cathode materials for Na ion batteries.9−16 However, the design of a suitable anode material is a major challenge
that is impeding the further progress in this field.

A variety
of anode materials including intercalation,17,18 conversion, and alloying types have been proposed for Na ion batteries.3 Redox alloying of Na with Si, Sn, Pb, Sb, and
Bi and other sodiation/desodiation reversible redox reactions with
sulfides, selenides, phosphides, and elements like phosphorus or sulfur
have opened a broad choice of promising anode materials for Na ion
batteries.19−27 However, huge volume expansions and lack of long-term reversibility
restrict their use as commercially stable anode materials.1,28−30 The use of graphite also did not lead to the desirable
performance because of some fundamental differences in the Na ion
and Li ion intercalation/deintercalation chemistries. Although, both
belong to the same group and undergo a similar one-electron redox
transformation, the differences in size make graphitic intercalation
of Na difficult in comparison to Li.

Carbon provides options
in a variety of less ordered forms like
hard carbons,31 carbon blacks, pet cokes,
and reduced graphene oxide papers.32−36 These carbon forms have delivered highest reversible
capacity close to 300 mAh g–1, which is comparable
to the Li ion capacity of graphite, that is, 372 mAh g–1. These carbon forms, unlike graphite, possess larger interlayer
separations for free intercalation and deintercalation of Na ions.36−38 Micropores further assist in reversible Na ion storage by reversible
insertion and extraction through the pores, which is different from
the conventional intercalation mechanism.39−41 High-temperature
pyrolysis of sugars, proteins, synthetic polymers, and biomass precursors
are some of the routes to obtain hard carbons useful for Na ion batteries.36,42 Composites of these hard carbons with CNTs and graphene have delivered
satisfactory Na ion performance.43−47

However, a quest for making Na ion battery
technology cheaper has
shifted focus toward the use of natural precursors for hard carbons,
for example, biowastes and natural products. Hard carbons derived
from banana peels, lotus petiole, okra byproduct, peanut shells, natural
wood fibers, or compact wood have delivered satisfactory Na ion anode
performance.48−56

In this work, we report the synthesis of hard carbons by direct
pyrolysis of a densely packed cellulosic precursor, the walnut shell,
and we demonstrate its use as an anode material in a Na ion battery.
Earlier reports on walnut shell have asserted its role as a support
for a well-known Na ion battery anode material, that is, Sn,57 and also as a support for the transition metal
for catalytic applications.58,59 The nutshell-derived
carbon (NDC) material showed an impressive initial reversible capacity
of 257 mAh g–1 at 50 mA g–1. The
material retains this capacity even after high current cycling up
to 2 A g–1. A remarkable cycling stability with
a small initial loss and stable capacity up to 300 charging–discharging
cycles is observed. These performance parameters for the current material
are comparable to recently reported hard carbons derived from biomass
and synthetic polymer precursors.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Carbon Materials
Fresh nutshells were
crushed and subsequently washed thoroughly, first with 2 M HCl and
then with deionized (DI) water and ethanol, to remove the mineral
salts and soluble organic matter. The crushed small nutshell chunks
were then dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. The dried
pieces were directly subjected to pyrolysis in a tube furnace at three
different temperatures, 800 °C, 1000 °C, and 1200 °C,
under the flow of inert argon gas. The pyrolysis process was carried
out for 6 h while increasing the temperature at the rate of 5 °C
min–1. After pyrolysis, the carbon samples were
collected and then washed with DI water and ethanol. The washed carbon
samples were dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. The carbon materials
resulting from the pyrolysis at 800 °C, 1000 °C, and 1200
°C are named NDC-800, NDC-1000, and NDC-1200, respectively. The
schematic for the synthesis of the NDC carbon material from the walnut
shell is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of hard carbon from a walnut
shell.

Characterization of NDC
Samples
The different carbon
samples synthesized from walnut shells were examined by X-ray powder
diffraction using the Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer with
nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectroscopy was performed
using Lab RAMHR800 from JY Horiba. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was performed using a JEOL JEM-2200FS field emission (FE)-TEM
operating at 200 kV. FE-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed
with the help of Nova Nano SEM 450. The surface area values for all
the samples were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) adsorption method (Quadrasorb automatic volumetric instrument).
Cyclic voltammetry and impedance measurements were performed using
a BioLogic VMP3 multichannel potentiogalvanostat. Charge–discharge
measurements were performed with the help of an MTI Corp. multichannel
battery testing system.

Electrode and Coin Cell Preparation for Electrochemical
Measurement
The electrodes for the electrochemical analysis
were prepared by
coating a slurry of 5 wt % of poly(vinylidene difluoride) binder 15
wt % of conducting carbon (super-P), and 80 wt % of NDC materials
prepared in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) on a carbon-coated
aluminum foil. The material-coated foil after drying was cut into
circular disk with the help of a punching machine fitted with cutters
suitable for coin cells of CR2032. The material loadings in the range
of 2.0–3.0 mg were achieved. The CR2032 cells for electrochemical
testing were assembled inside an argon-filled glove box at extremely
low O2 and H2O (0.2–1.0 ppm) concentrations.
The metallic Na disk was used on the other side. The two electrodes
were separated by a circular polyethylene separator soaked in the
electrolyte solution. NaClO4 (1 M) in 1:1 volume ratio
of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) having 5 wt
% of fluoroethylene carbonate already dissolved in it was used as
the electrolyte.

Results and Discussion
Morphological
transformation of the walnut shell upon pyrolysis
into the carbon material is depicted in Figure 2. The cross-sectional morphology comparison
of a fresh nutshell (Figure 2a,c) and the one pyrolyzed at 1000 °C (NDC-1000, Figure 2b,d) is shown. The
continuous channels running parallel to the surface of the shell could
be seen in the fresh nutshell, as depicted in Figure 2c. Upon pyrolysis, the hard shells turn into
carbonaceous products, as shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 Morphology transformation of the walnut shell
upon pyrolysis is
depicted here. (a) Picture of a typical walnut shell, (b) picture

shell. (c) Cross-sectional SEM image of a fresh walnut shell. (d)
Cross-sectional SEM image of the carbon product obtained from the
walnut shell by pyrolysis at 1000 °C (NDC-1000).

The FE-SEM micrograph of the pyrolyzed walnut shell
is shown in Figure 2d. The image shows
that pyrolysis into the carbon product does not lead to disappearance
of interlayer free spaces, rather a large number of them can be seen
retained in the carbon product, although in the modified form. The
presence of this type of open space can be advantageous for the better
electrochemical performance because better connectivity between the
carbon material and electrolyte is attainable.53,60

The TEM micrograph of the NDC-1000 sample is shown in Figure 3. The material is
characterized by the presence of turbostratic graphitic domains scattered
in a non-graphitic carbon matrix, as expected for a typical hard carbon
material. The interplanar separation (averaged) of the order of ∼0.38
nm is observed by the TEM fringe analysis, as can be clearly inferred
from Figure 3. The
particular separation, in the carbon material, makes NDC-1000 a suitable
choice for reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Na ions.

Figure 3 TEM micrograph
shows the turbostratic graphitic regions in the
matrix of a nongraphitic carbon.

The pyrolysis of the nutshell was also performed at 800 and
1200
°C in addition to 1000 °C. Figure 4a–c compares the SEM images of three
carbon samples synthesized from walnut shells. It could be seen that
there is no evident surface morphological distinction between NDC-800,
NDC-1000, and NDC-1200 samples in the micron regime.

XRD and Raman analyses of three samples reveal that the crystal
planar and atomic arrangement is not altered significantly with the
increase in the pyrolysis temperature, the property typically associated
with hard carbons. Figure 4d–e shows the XRD and Raman plots of NDC samples obtained
at three pyrolysis temperatures. The XRD analysis (Figure 4d) shows that interplanar (002)
separations for the three pyrolysis cases are also almost similar,
with the values of 0.39, 0.37, and 0.37 nm, respectively, for NDC-800,
NDC-1000, and NDC-1200.

The separations correspond to the (002)
peak positions of 21.78°,
22.78°, and 22.68°, respectively, as brought out by Figure 4d. An interplanar
separation >0.36 nm is considered favorable for efficient Na ion
intercalation
and deintercalation in the carbon lattice. Thus, the NDC materials
qualify for direct use as anode in the Na ion battery.36

Raman plots (Figure 4e) further establish the fact that the NDCs
are the typical representative
of hard carbons, as there is no or negligible further graphitization
with the increase in the carbonization temperatures above 800 °C.
The presence of Raman bands at 1320 and 1590 cm–1 is attributed to well-known D and G bands of defective graphite.61,62Table 1 summarizes
the XRD and Raman parameters and establishes the hard carbon nature
of NDC samples, as there is no improvement in IG/ID ratios at elevated temperatures.61,62

The low-surface area nature of NDC
samples was confirmed by the
BET analysis. Figure 4f–g compares the isotherm (Figure 4f) and pore size distribution plot (Figure 4g) for NDC samples.
A very low surface area of 59 m2 g–1 with
no pores in the micropore regime (<2 nm) was observed for NDC-1000,
whereas NDC-800 and NDC-1200 displayed a surface area of 120 and 19
m2 g–1, respectively, with a similar
pore distribution. Low-surface area carbons are considered ideal for
Na ion batteries because the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer
has to form over a lesser surface area, which in turn implies a less
electrolyte degradation.38,63,64

The electrochemical performance of NDC samples was analyzed
by
cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge–discharge, and impedance analyses.
The rate performance graphs, which plot capacities calculated from
the charge–discharge measurement at different current densities
versus the cycle number, furnish information about the current stability
of the battery material. Figure 5 shows the rate stability comparisons of the NDC samples.
Whereas the NDC-800 sample displays a reversible capacity of 165 mAh
g–1 at 50 mA g–1, the reversible
capacity of NDC-1000 was observed to be 257 mAh g–1 at 50 mA g–1. NDC-1200 displayed a reversible
capacity of 254 mA g–1 at 50 mA g–1. All of the samples showed good capacity recovery (98, 97, and 87%,
respectively), even up to a high cycling current of 2 A g–1. The capacities of NDC-1000 and NDC-1200 at different current densities
are almost the same, further highlighting the hard nature of NDC carbons.
The lower capacities of NDC-800 may be attributed to the low conductivities
and resulting lower intergrain void spaces obtainable from such small
in-plane crystallites (Table 1). The assignment is supported by the work of Y. Li et al.
and few other reports on hard carbons for Na ion battery applications.65,66Table 2 compares
the capacities of various recently reported interesting carbon materials
with NDC-1000. It can be concluded from the table that the present
carbon material is comparable to other reported carbon forms in terms
of capacity and stability.48,50,54−56,67−70

The electrochemical aspects of Na+ ion
storage in NDC samples were studied with NDC-1000 as a representative example. Figure 6 elucidates the electrochemical
performance of the NDC-1000 as an anode material in the Na ion cell. Figure 6a shows the CV plots
(first four cycles) of NDC-1000 taken in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0
V in 1 M NaClO4 in an EC–DMC (1:1, 5% FEC) solvent
at a voltage scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. The cathodic
peaks I and II observed at 1.06 and 0.49 V, respectively, are seen
in the first discharge cycle only and disappear in the subsequent
cycles. These two peaks are attributed to the SEI layer formation
on the electrode surface through irreversible electrolyte decomposition
at the mentioned potentials.36,71 The pair of cathodic/anodic
peaks is observed reversibly at 0.02 and 0.21 V, respectively, and
are designated as peaks III and III′ in the CV plot. The cathodic
peak III (0.02 V) is attributed to the reversible reductive insertion
of Na+ into the nanopores formed between the semigraphitic
domains of NDC-1000.36 Peak III′
(0.21 V) is the corresponding anodic peak of peak III and can be attributed
to oxidative deinsertion of Na from the porous domains formed between
the semigraphitic lattices of NDC-1000. The additional pair of reversible
cathodic/anodic peaks marked peaks IV and IV′ is observed at
0.63 and 0.93 V, respectively.36,38 The emergence of this
broad peak pair is attributed to the Na+ storage by a mechanism
different from insertion and deinsertion to and from the porous domains,
which operates at lower voltages. Peaks IV and IV′ are attributed
to the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Na+ into the turbostratic lattices of NDC-1000, respectively. Thus,
two mechanisms of Na+ storage are operative, with the redox
insertion/deinsertion into pores lying in between the graphitic lattices
being the dominant one, as is further revealed by the charge–discharge
plots shown in Figure 6b. The charge–discharge profile of NDC-1000 is shown up to
three initial cycles. The higher first cycle discharge capacity of
362 mAh g–1 can be attributed to the contribution
from the SEI layer formation with minor plateaus at ∼1.06 and
∼0.42 V, which are not seen in subsequent cycles.36,38 The reversible capacity of 257 mAh g–1 is observed
in the second discharge cycle, which remains almost constant for the
next few cycles. The total capacity has contributions from the two
operating mechanisms, as is evident from the CV analysis. The second
(and subsequent) discharge curves are marked into two regions, with
a sloping region in the voltage range of 0.93–0.08 V and a
plateau region in the voltage range of 0.08–0.01 V.36,38,66,72 The sloping region (Figure 6b), which contributes 100 mAh g–1 to the
total discharge capacity (257 mAh g–1), can be attributed
to Na+ storage in the interlayers of NDC-1000, as discussed
earlier. The plateau region (Figure 6b) remains a dominant contributor to the total capacity,
that is, 257 mAh g–1. The plateau capacity can be
attributed to the Na+ insertion/deinsertion in the porous
regions of NDC-1000 as confirmed by the CV analysis earlier. The charge
profiles of NDC-1000 in Figure 6b also show complementary sloping and plateau regions, which
agree well with the CV analysis.36,38

Figure 6 Na ion storage
inside NDC-1000 is explained here through CV, charge–discharge,
and impedance measurements. (a) CV profile of NDC-1000. (b) Charge–discharge
profile of NDC-1000. (c) Nyquist plot of NDC-1000 in the frequency
range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz. (d) Long-term stability of NDC-1000 in
a Na ion half cell up to 300 cycles.

Impedance analysis of NDC-1000 was performed on the fresh
cell
that had undergone five charge–discharge cycles, to nullify
interferences from the resistances offered by the SEI layer formation. Figure 6c shows the Nyquist
plot recorded on NDC-1000 in a coin cell against the Na/Na+ electrode. The two regions in the Nyquist plot can be clearly distinguished.
The high-frequency region displays a semicircle of a smaller diameter,
which implies a low charge transfer resistance (RCT ∼ 180Ω). In addition, an electrochemical
series resistance (ESR) of 1.44Ω was observed from the first
intercept on the X axis which implies low material
and solution resistance. Both low RCT and
low ESR project NDC-1000 as a competitive Na+ anode material.36,73

Cyclic stability analysis was also performed to examine the
stability
of the material in the working condition over a period of time that
in turn reflects the durability of the device. Cyclic stability of
NDC-1000 was monitored by capacity analysis over 300 continuous discharging
and charging cycles carried out at 100 mA g–1; the
result is shown in Figure 6d. The material displays remarkable stability over 300 charge–discharge
cycles after the initial reduction from 240 mAh g–1 (at 100 mA g–1) to 170 mAh g–1. The cyclic stability so observed is quite comparable to the reported
carbon materials for anode applications.48,50,55,56,67−70

Conclusions
In this article, we
report the synthesis of a hard carbon material
from the walnut shell biowaste. We show that high-temperature carbonization
of compactly packed cellulose fibers in a rigid walnut shell leads
to hard and dense carbon materials with a surface area of 59 m2 g–1, which is particularly advantageous
in Na ion batteries due to lesser SEI formation than in high-surface
area carbon forms. This hard carbon material possesses sufficiently
separated micrographene-like sheets (>0.36 nm) in the semigraphitic
domains to act as an ideal anode material for Na ion batteries. An
excellent reversible capacity of 257 mAh g–1 is
observed at 50 mA g–1 along with good cycling stability.
A capacity retention of 71% is observed even after 300 charge–discharge
cycles. Further, the carbon material (NDC-1000) shows a remarkable
rate performance with 97% retention after cycling at high current
densities of up to 2 A g–1.
