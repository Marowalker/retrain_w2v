LaFexCo(1–x)O3 thin films were prepared on fluorine-doped tin
oxide conducting glass substrates by spray pyrolysis without any conductive
additives and evaluated for their ability to catalyze the oxygen reduction
reaction. Onset potential and current density were found to be comparable
to platinum, and the resulting crystallite size was on the order of
20 nm. Coordination of the precursor metal ions by citrate was found
not to be advantageous. Results from multiple scan linear sweep voltammetry
suggest lattice oxide saturation during reduction of oxygen and lattice
oxide depletion upon water oxidation. The color of the best-performing
composition changes dramatically between 1.2 and −1.15 V versus
saturated calomel electrode, so X-ray photoelectron spectra of the
fully oxidized and reduced films were compared, demonstrating that
cobalt in the film changes oxidation state. Performance of the films
as a function of iron-to-cobalt ratio is consistent with what others
have reported in the literature, indicating that spray pyrolysis is
an efficient method to prepare and evaluate new catalytic materials.

Introduction
The oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) determines the overall performance
of several renewable energy technologies, involving energy production,
conversion, and storage, such as photoelectrochemistry,1 fuel cells,2 and metal–air
batteries.3 This is because the ORR is
a kinetically slow process compared to the hydrogen oxidation reaction.4 Precious metal-based cathodes are thus far the
best electrocatalysts for the ORR;5−7 however, the utilization
of catalysts such as Pt and Ir in the cathode greatly hinders the
large-scale commercial applications because of their limited supply
and high cost. Pt-based air cathodes are claimed to be responsible
for at least 50% of the total cost of zinc–air fuel cells.3

La-based perovskite oxides with the formula
ABO3 have
drawn considerable attention as non-Pt catalysts because of their
low cost, good catalytic activity, stable crystal structure, and the
ability of the perovskite crystal lattice to host a variety of metal
cations.8,9 The crystal structure, ionic transport properties,
and ORR activity depend on the identity of the elements in the A-site
(La) and B-site (transition metals, e.g., Fe), both as individual
cations or mixtures (such as Fe and Co in the B-site).8,10,11 The ability of the B-site cation
to adopt different valence states is believed to help promote the
ORR activity.4 Conductive additives, such
as carbon, are often added to increase conductivity; however, their
presence obscures the catalytic contribution of the perovskite to
the overall catalysis of the composite12,13 and the presence
of carbon limits the utility of the catalyst because of the carbon
corrosion problem.7,14

We report the preparation
of LaFexCo(1–x)O3 thin films using
the spray pyrolysis deposition technique.15 Thin-film, well-crystallized, single-phase perovskite materials
have been previously prepared by spray pyrolysis.16,17 This technique has been widely used to deposit metal oxide thin
films due to its cost-effectiveness and suitability for mass production;
however, this is the first time LaFexCo(1–x)O3 materials have been
prepared by spray pyrolysis and electrochemically evaluated on conductive
fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. The catalytic properties
of LaFeO3, LaCoO3, and LaFexCo(1–x)O3 mixed
perovskite oxides have been previously reported in the literature.
Sunarso et al. synthesized several La-based binary perovskite oxide
powders through an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)–citrate
complexing process and annealed them on glassy carbon disk electrodes.11 Wang et al. used a co-nanocasting technique
to synthesize a LaFexCo(1–x)O3 carbon composite starting with a metal
nitrate/citric acid mixture followed by calcination over a silica
template.18 We have found that simple spray
pyrolysis of nitrate precursors without the addition of inorganic
carbon is a practical technique to prepare electrocatalytic materials
for the ORR, and the resulting electrodes have a similar performance
when compared to Pt. More importantly, spray pyrolysis provides a
more efficient method to screen potential catalysts without the added
complexity of a conductive additive and binder such as Nafion.

Results
and Discussions
We first prepared thin-film catalysts on
FTO substrates by spraying
both simple nitrate salt solutions of the metal ions and the metal
ions complexed with citric acid/ethylene glycol, finding that citrate
complexation is not required for the preparation of these materials;
in fact, we found that the films prepared from citrate precursors
do not adhere well to the FTO substrate. Figure 1 shows the linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs)
for the ORR of LaFeO3 prepared from a nitrate precursor,
LaFeO3 (citrate precursor), and LaCoO3 (nitrate
precursor). The Co citrate precursor solutions did not adhere to the
FTO; hence, no LaCoO3 (citrate precursor) films could be
produced.

Figure 1 Comparison of the linear sweep voltammograms for the ORR of LaFeO3 prepared from a simple nitrate salt solution (blue), LaFeO3 prepared from the citrate/ethylene glycol complex solution
(red), and LaCoO3 prepared from a simple nitrate salt solution
(black). All were run at 6 mV/s in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution vs a saturated calomel reference electrode
(SCE).

The ORR onset potential improved
in the order of LaFeO3 (nitrate precursor), LaFeO3 (citrate precursor), which
was only slightly better, and LaCoO3 (nitrate precursor),
which was significantly better (200 mV more positive onset potential).
The expected positive shift in onset potential was observed when switching
Co for Fe.11 The LaFeO3 (citrate
precursor) performed slightly better than the film prepared from LaFeO3 (nitrate precursor); however, because the citrate films did
not adhere well to the FTO substrate and could be easily wiped off,
all further films were prepared from simple nitrate, 10% ethanol solutions.
The slightly better performance of the citrate precursor material
may be due to its greater surface area (flakes barely attached to
the surface vs a fully attached film), as shown by the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image in Figure S1. In
comparison, the LaFeO3 film prepared from nitrate solutions
produced a smooth film with large cracks (∼1 μm wide).
No noticeable cathodic current between −0.75 and + 0.1 V was
observed for our films in a nitrogen (N2)-saturated solution,
as expected for an oxygen-free solution. The slightly basic Na2SO4 electrolyte was chosen to test potential catalytic
materials to avoid any dissolution of the materials in either too
acidic or basic solution. Many metal oxides dissolve in acidic solution
and some can also dissolve in highly basic solution. These amphoteric
metal oxides form soluble hydroxo complexes at high pH, which can
lead to the deterioration of the material and may lead to misinterpreting
poor catalysis due to the low stability of the material at high pH.
After purging the 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with
oxygen, the pH was typically 8.2.

Figure 2 shows LSVs
representing the ORR in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 using thin films of LaFexCo(1–x)O3 (x = 0, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, and 0.75). The ORR current is
improved in the order of LaFe0.75Co0.25O3, LaFe0.20Co0.80O3, LaCoO3, LaFe0.25Co0.75O3, LaFe0.50Co0.50O3, LaFe0.30Co0.70O3, and LaFe0.40Co0.60O3 (eight layers), and finally the best material, LaFe0.40Co0.60O3 (four layers) (all films
were produced from a nitrate precursor solution, which were eight
layers thick except where noted). Increasing the amount of Co in the
material clearly enhances the catalytic activity and shifts the onset
potential to more positive values up to the optimum LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 composition. In 2012, Sunarso et al.
also pointed out the beneficial catalytic effect from having two transition
metals sharing the B-site,11 and Wang et
al. found that this specific composition was the best of the mesoporous
LaFexCo(1–x)O3 series produced from co-nanocasting citric acid
complexed metal nitrate precursors onto a silica template.18 Interestingly, they did not observe LaCoO3 to display any catalytic effect in contrast to our results
and others.11,19,20 We note also in Figure 2 that the thickness of LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film is an important parameter: the most active film was
obtained when four layers of material were deposited.

Figure 2 LSV of the ORR activity
for different compositions of LaFexCo(1–x)O3 thin films on FTO
at a scan rate of 6 mV/s in oxygen-saturated
0.1 M Na2SO4 solutions vs SCE.

Figure 3A compares
the LSVs for the ORR in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 of the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film
(four layers), a Pt metal flag electrode, and the plain FTO substrate.
To directly compare the performance of the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film and Pt flag electrodes, a bipotentiostat
was used to scan both electrodes at the same time under the exact
same conditions. Current densities were determined by dividing the
measured current by the geometric surface areas of the electrodes.
We can see that LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 shows
comparable ORR activity to Pt, and they both surpass the performance
of the FTO substrate. The Pt flag electrode was first heated to red
hot in a glassblowing torch and then conditioned (cycled between +0.2
and −0.8 V vs SCE) for 30 min until a reproducible LSV was
observed. This conditioning was found to be very reproducible and
stable: the Pt electrode could be left out on the counter and placed
back in solution after days to yield the same voltammogram, which
made it a good reference for comparison. Figure S2 shows the LSV of the Pt electrode after polishing with 0.3
μm alumina, flame treatment, and flame treatment followed by
conditioning. The flamed/conditioned Pt was the most reproducible
and stable, but the polished Pt surface gave the best onset potential;
however, it varied with each polishing and changed over time. Figure 3B shows successive
LSVs for the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film.
We note that the first scan is quite different and positive of the
following two scans. Next, the film was cycled twice between 0.2 and
1.5 V versus SCE (1.5 V is slightly above the onset of the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER)) and then the ORR LSVs were measured again.
The first scan after OER is even better (more positive onset) than
the first scan of the fresh film, and the subsequent scan matches
well with the second and third scans of the fresh film. It is possible
that the material becomes saturated with oxide during ORR, reducing
its catalytic effectiveness after the first scan, and during OER,
oxygen vacancies are generated in the lattice, improving catalysis.
The formation of oxygen vacancies due to substitution of Ba2+ or Sr2+ for some of the La3+ or the preparing
material deficient in La3+ has been attributed to improved
catalysis.8,21−23 Interestingly, the presence
of iron also has been shown to improve adsorption/desorption of oxygen.24 Because of the significant difference between
the first scan and subsequent scans, in this study, we report/compare
second and third scans of the different materials (Figures 1, 2, and 3A). For the direct comparison of our
material to others reported in the literature, we measured the ORR
of our optimized film in oxygen-saturated 0.100 M NaOH (Figure 4) correcting for both iR drop, as determined by alternating current (AC) impedance,
and calibrating the potential to the real hydrogen electrode (RHE)
by defining the point of zero current as 0 V from the hydrogen oxidation/evolution
reaction at our Pt flag electrode in the same cell and electrolyte
(Figure S3). The solution resistance measured
by AC impedance between the Pt flag electrode and Pt mesh counter
electrode in our cell was on the order of 10 Ω. The resistance
measured between a bare FTO electrode and the Pt mesh electrode was
110 Ω, and the resistance between LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film on FTO and the Pt mesh electrode was 130 Ω
obtained from the Bode plot shown in Figure S3.

pyrolysis on FTO to flamed/cycled Pt foil, and uncoated FTO. The LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 thin film and Pt foil were
run simultaneously in a four-electrode cell. (B) Successive LSVs of
the ORR for the four-pass LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 thin film. The legend gives the time order of the scans.
Note scans 6 and 7 were done after sweeping out to the potential,
where the OER occurs. All scans were done at a scan rate of 6 mV/s
in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 solutions vs
SCE.

Figure 4 LSV of LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film in
oxygen-saturated 0.100 M NaOH measured at 6 mV/s in a quiescent solution
on a stationary FTO substrate. The voltammogram was corrected for
ohmic electrolyte and substrate resistance (iR) and
normalized to the geometric area of the electrode. A Tafel plot of
the LSV is shown in the inset (see Experimental Methods and Supporting Information).

The onset potential is typical for similar perovskites
reported
in the literature.19,23,25−27 The current density is however lower than what is
typically seen because all our voltammograms are measured on stationary
electrodes in quiescent solutions, while much of the work in this
field has been performed on rotating disk electrodes, which provide
forced convection of the oxygen to the electrode. Our currents are
limited by oxygen diffusion to the electrode and, as shown in Figure 3a, similar to the
Pt foil electrode under the same conditions. Suntivich et al. demonstrated
the significant increase in current density with rotation rate at
a rotating disk electrode for a LaCu0.5Mn0.5O3 electrode.19 Therefore,
care should be taken comparing our current densities and Tafel plot
(Figure 4 inset) with
those derived from hydrodynamic voltammetric experiments at rotating
disk electrodes.

The catalytic activity of perovskites is strongly
influenced by
the transition-metal cation in the B-site.7,8,11 In addition, the ORR activity of La-based
perovskites is believed to be strongly associated with the ability
of the transition-metal cation in the B-site to be able to vary its
valence state. Wang et al. attributed the active site for ORR activity
to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple and claimed that
the semiconducting band structure of LaFeO3 offers much
lower electrical conductivity than that of LaCoO3, which
results in suppressed catalytic activity for ORR at overly high Fe-doping
levels.18 They reported that LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 represents the best balance between
the ability of the B-site transition metal to change oxidation state
and the overall electrical conductivity of the film.

Spectroelectrochemistry
has been used to follow changes in the
oxidation state of transition metals in thin films on FTO.28 Because FTO is an optically transparent electrode,
we were able to observe a reversible color change of the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film during the voltammetry,
and so did a spectroelectrochemical characterization of the film between
the applied potentials of −1.15 to +1.2 V versus SCE. Figure 5A shows the absorbance
spectrum of a LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 thin
film at different applied potentials. The ability to oxidize and reduce
the film several times and see no decrease in the absorbance of the
film is a testament to its stability.

Figure 5 (A) Visible absorption spectra of the
four-layer LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 thin film
in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution vs SCE as a function
of applied potential. Applied
potentials corresponding to the absorption spectra are provided in
the legend. The inset is a photo of the oxidized and reduced film.
(B–D) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the
fully oxidized film (blue) and reduced film (red) in the 2p binding
energy region of iron (B), cobalt (C), and 3d binding energy region
of lanthanum (D).

The absorption measurements
were taken after allowing enough time
under applied potential for the complete stabilization of the absorption
by repeatedly measuring the spectra at each potential until the spectra
were consistent. The color of the oxide layer appears brown/black
after annealing as well as under positive applied potentials, but
lightens to tan when reduced (inset of Figure 5A). This change in absorbance suggests that
one or more of the metal ions is changing its oxidation state and
that the change is reversible. This is an unusual color change for
a spectroelectrochemical study of a transition metal, as it is more
typical to see a shift in color rather than a change in color intensity.
CoO solid is olive green in color and can be oxidized to Co3O4, which is a black mix valent oxide. Considering these
oxides, one might expect to see an absorption band growing in the
red region upon reduction; however, the perovskite structure clearly
alters the cobalt ion’s absorption in our materials.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to determine
oxidation state26 and subtle changes in
structure29 in perovskite materials. To
determine which transition-metal ion is undergoing a change in oxidation
state, we took two electrodes cut from the same substrate, fully oxidized
one and fully reduced the other, and did an XPS analysis (Figure 5B–D) of the
resulting films to determine which redox couple, Fe3+/Fe2+ or Co3+/Co2+, changed its oxidation
state and thus contributes to the ORR activity using the Thermo Scientific
elemental XPS website as a reference.30 The XPS results for iron show the expected 2p1/2 and
2p3/2 spin–orbit peaks. The binding energy of the
2p3/2 at 710 eV with no lower-energy shoulder is consistent
with the Fe3+ oxidation state, and there appears little
spectral difference between the two electrodes.31,32 The cobalt region, however, shows a significant difference between
the oxidized and reduced films. Cobalt also displays 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 spin–orbit peaks; however, Co2+ is shifted to higher binding energy than Co3+ and has
satellite peaks at 786 and 802 eV. This is an exception to the general
rule that binding energy increases with oxidation state.27,33,34 The oxidized film best matches
Co3+ and the reduced film clearly contains Co2+ with the shift of the two spin–orbit peaks to higher energy
and the significant growth of the two satellite peaks. This clearly
indicates that the cobalt and not the iron is changing oxidation state.
The XPS of the La 3d region shows the four expected spin–orbit
peaks.35,36 The binding energy of these peaks is consistent
with the +3 oxidation state; however, the split between the peaks
and the overall binding energy shift between the two films suggest
that the chemical environment around the lanthanum changes between
the two potentials. This change in structure might be contributing
to the unusual color change observed with reduction of the material.

The films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm
the crystal structure and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to identify the elemental
composition, distribution, and thickness of the catalyst layer. XRD
data were collected using Bragg–Brentano geometry (Figure 6) and showed the
expected cubic perovskite pattern along with the SnO2 (cassiterite)
phase (PDF#00-046-1088) of the underlying FTO conductive layer (blue
overlaid lines). The remaining peak at 54.5° is unknown but comes
from the substrate (Figure S4).

Figure 6 XRD pattern
of the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film on FTO
indexed to cassiterite (SnO2, blue lines,
PDF#00-046-1088) and LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 (red lines, PDF#00-040-0224). Note that the ratio of iron to cobalt
in the indexed perovskite phase is the opposite of our material resulting
the observed shift in 2θ.

The lines of the indexed LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 crystalline phase (PDF#00-040-0224) are also overlaid
on
the XRD pattern (red). We note that the ratio of iron to cobalt in
our material and the indexed perovskite are opposite. This results
in the lines of our LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 phase being shifted to higher 2θ values due to the difference
in the size of Fe3+ versus Co3+ ions relative
to indexed LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 phase.
Our material having less iron (the larger ion) causes a lattice contraction
and thus the peaks shifting to higher 2θ.18 The broad scattering intensity or “halo”
seen in the lower 2θ region of the XRD pattern is due to the
amorphous glass substrate. Low-angle, fixed-incidence scans did not
yield strong scattering halos. As the incident angle was reduced,
the penetration of the X-rays into the substrate is reduced, which
resulted in the halo decreasing (Figure S4). This suggests that there is little amorphous material in our film
because as the X-rays interact more with the film and less with the
glass substrate the halo due to the presence of amorphous material
decreases significantly. It is interesting to note that the widths
of our peaks are wider than expected, suggesting our material is nanocrystalline.
The peak at 2θ = 47.1° has an full width at half-maximum
of 0.534 compared to the expected instrument line width of 0.125,
indicating that the crystallite size in our material is on the order
of 20 nm, as calculated using the Scherrer equation. This is consistent
with the crystallite size observed with the spray pyrolysis deposition
of La1–xCaxMnO3 (40–70 nm)16 and
LaFeO3 (25–35 nm);17 with
the crystallite size depending on the spray pyrolysis conditions.
Traditional methods of perovskite catalyst preparation require high-temperature
calcination steps, resulting in the sintering of the material, producing
particles typically ranging in size from 200 nm to 1 μm. The
increase in crystallite size reduces the surface area and thus the
catalytic efficiency of the material.8,9,25 This highlights another advantage of our relatively
low-temperature (500 °C) spray pyrolysis preparation method.

Figure 7A shows
the backscattered SEM image of LaFe0.4Co0.6O3. The composition of the film is uniform with very small cracks,
which can only be seen at a high magnification. Elemental maps shown
in Figure S5 demonstrate an even distribution
of La, Fe, and Co in the sample and confirm the atomic ratio of La/Fe/Co
to be 11.1:4.1:6.1. The oxygen in the film cannot be determined because
of the contribution of oxygen signal from the underlying FTO and glass
substrate. Figure 7B shows the backscattered SEM image of the edge of a freshly broken
LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 sample showing the
thickness of the film to be approximately 430 nm.

Conclusions
Spray pyrolysis of simple,
uncomplexed metal nitrate salt solutions
onto FTO can be used to produce LaFexCo(1–x)O3 electrocatalysts,
showing comparable oxygen reduction reaction activity to Pt without
conductive additives. The spray pyrolysis procedure requires fewer
steps and lower temperatures than the more common methods of preparation
and produces smaller crystallites, on the order of 20 nm. High-temperature
preparation has been found to be detrimental due to the tendency of
perovskites to sinter, thus reducing their surface area and catalytic
performance. In addition, because the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 was grown on an optically transparent electrode, we
could observe the color change of the films and perform spectroelectrochemistry
coupled with XPS analysis to demonstrate that the cobalt ion sharing
the B-site with iron is undergoing reversible oxidation/reduction
during voltammetry and thus is most likely responsible for the electrocatalysis.
Finally, we have found that the catalysts produced behave in a similar
way to other literature preparations: specifically, in the LaFexCo(1–x)O3 series, the LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 is the best-performing composition, and the onset potential of that
composition is comparable to other perovskite materials reported in
the literature. This suggests that spray pyrolysis may be an ideal
method to screen and compare potential catalysts and possibly to manufacture
these materials.

Experimental Methods
Oxide Electrode Preparation
Lanthanum(III) nitrate
hexahydrate (99.0% purity), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (99.95%
purity), cobalt(III) nitrate hexahydrate (99.999%, this level of purity
is not necessary), citric acid (99.5% purity), and ethylene glycol
(99.8% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification. Spray solutions of lanthanum/iron/cobalt nitrate
were prepared by dissolving the metal nitrates in 10% ethanol/deionized
water to make a solution with La3+ ion concentration of
0.15 M. The concentrations of Fe3+ and Co3+ ions
were varied (La/Fe/Co = 1:0.20:0.80, 1:0.25:0.75, 1:0.30:0.70, 1:0.40:0.60,
1:0.50:0.50, and 1:0.75:0.25). The conventional method for synthesizing
La-based perovskite powders is through an EDTA–citrate,11 ethylene glycol–citrate,17 or just citric acid18 complexation.
Typically, the metal nitrates are dissolved in one of these mixtures
and heated to 60 °C under continuous stirring for 2 h until a
thick gel is formed. The gel is then calcinated at high temperatures
(700 °C and above) to form the oxide powders. When we tried the
citrate complexation technique (procedure adapted from Milanova et
al.17), we diluted the prepared gel in
10% EtOH–deionized water and performed our normal spraying
procedure.

A custom glass sprayer (Figure S6) was constructed from a standard 10.00 mL glass pipette
by removing the bulb and adding a sidearm for the flow of nitrogen
gas. The reagent solution is drawn from a flask through 0.5 mm inner
diameter tubing that connects to an internal capillary tube, which
has an outer diameter of 0.5 mm on the spray end and 1.5 mm on the
tubing end. A small piece of rubber tubing creates a seal between
the capillary and the glass sprayer. The measured flow rate of the
sprayer was 5–6 mL/min at a pressure of 20 psi.

The solutions
were deposited onto 76 mm (3 in.) square SnO2/F (FTO) conductive
glass substrates (Hartford Glass). Before
spraying, the substrate was washed with detergent (Fisherbrand Versa-Clean,
04-342), rinsed with deionized water, followed by 99% ethanol, and
then wiped dry with Kimwipes. The substrate was then rinsed with 99%
methanol and wiped again with Kimwipes, followed by a cotton, lint-free
cloth. Once cleaned, the substrate was placed in a U-shaped bracket
(conductive side facing the sprayer) mounted on an aluminum base plate
that is attached to a hot plate. During spraying, the substrate was
heated to ∼170 °C by setting the hot plate beneath the
aluminum base to 500 °C. The apparatus is constructed with a
lab jack and a ruler mounted on a wood track that allows for precise
repositioning of the hot plate (Y direction, up and
down). The sprayer, 11.5 cm from the substrate and 90° to the
substrate surface, is mounted on a Lego trolley that moves back and
forth, under computer control, in the X direction.
With movement of the trolley in the X direction and
movement of the hot plate in the Y direction, repositioning
can allow for any part of the substrate to be sprayed.

For electrochemical
characterizations, the bottom centimeter of
the FTO glass substrates was sprayed with the metal precursor solution.
After spraying, the substrates were allowed to slowly cool on the
hot plate and then placed in a room-temperature oven (Ney 2-160 Series
2), which was heated to 500 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and
held for 5–6 h to form the oxides and anneal the films. After
cooling slowly, the substrate was cut into ∼1 cm strips (Figure S7). The middle half of the conductive
surface was covered with clear finger nail polish (Rimmel 581 Clear)
so that nothing but the metal oxide layer was exposed to the electrolyte
solution, while still allowing electrical contact at the top of the
glass substrate.

Electrochemical Characterization for ORR
The synthesized
thin films were the working electrodes in a four-electrode electrochemical
cell (Figure S7) using 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and purged with O2 gas for
15 min prior to data collection. The voltammetric experiments were
performed at room temperature blanketed with an oxygen atmosphere.
SCE was used as the reference electrode and a Pt mesh as the counter
electrode. The electrochemical characterization consisted of a linear
sweep voltammogram (LSV) from +0.10 to −0.80 V at a scan rate
of 6 mV/s, controlled by a Pine Instruments bipotentiostat and recorded
with a PASCO Science Workshop (500 Interface) Data Logger using “Data
Studio” computer software. The current as a function of applied
potential was recorded simultaneously for the two working electrodes
under the same conditions. Current densities were determined by dividing
the current by the geometric surface area of the electrodes. Three
perovskite thin films were prepared for each composition to check
the reproducibility of the film quality and performance. All voltammograms
were smoothed using Excel’s exponential smoothing routine to
average low-frequency oscillations occurring at the low scan rate
used. The optimal composition ratio of the LaFexCo(1–x)O3 film
was determined by carrying out a comparative I–V curve analysis to see which composition would generate
the most positive onset potentials for oxygen reduction. Once the
composition and molar concentrations were optimized, the optimal film
thickness was determined by varying the number of spraying cycles.16,17

The ORR performance of our optimized material, four-layer
LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 film, was measured
in oxygen-saturated 0.100 M NaOH (Fisher Chemical, 0.0995–0.1005
M) in a three-electrode cell with the same Pt mesh counter electrode
and SCE reference electrode used in all of the other experiments.
The SCE was calibrated in the same 0.100 M NaOH electrolyte and cell
finding the potential at zero current for the hydrogen oxidation/reduction
at our freshly polished (0.3 μm alumina) Pt flag electrode in
bubbling hydrogen. The measured potential was −0.990 V, so
the potential versus RHE was calculated by adding 0.990 V to the potential
measured versus SCE. Ohmic resistance was determined by AC impedance
measured in 0.100 M NaOH and the same cell using a Princeton Applied
Research VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat with a root mean square voltage
amplitude of 10 mV. Ohmic losses were subtracted from the measured
potential and plotted as E–iR.37

Spectroelectrochemistry
An absorbance spectrum of the
LaFe0.4Co0.6O3 thin film was measured
with an Agilent 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer at several applied
potentials using the bare substrate as a blank. The film-coated FTO
working electrode, platinum mesh counter electrode, and SCE reference
electrodes were placed in a flat-sided cell filled with 0.1 M Na2SO4. The cell was the bottom three-fourths of a
Corning polystyrene tissue culture flask with the top machined off.
The applied potential was controlled using a Pine Instruments bipotentiostat.

Materials Characterization
All measurements were done
at Iowa State University’s Materials Analysis and Research
Laboratory. The SEM data were collected at 15 kV on an FEI Quanta-250
scanning electron microscope with a field emission gun. All images
are from backscattered electrons. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum
was acquired with an Oxford Aztec energy-dispersive spectrometer system
with an X-Max 80 detector having light element capability. Samples
were examined at a low-vacuum setting of 80 Pa of water except for
the edge image due to charging of the glass substrate. The XRD data
were measured on a Siemens D 500 diffractometer with a Cu X-ray tube
operated at 45 kV and 30 mA with medium-resolution slits and a diffracted
beam monochromator. A Kratos Amicus/ESCA 3400 instrument was used
to measure the XPS spectra. The sample was irradiated with 240 W unmonochromated
Mg Kα X-rays, and photoelectrons emitted at 0° from the
surface normal were energy-analyzed using a DuPont-type analyzer.
The pass energy was set at 150 eV and either a Shirley or linear baseline
was removed from all reported spectra. Raw data files were processed
using CasaXPS.
