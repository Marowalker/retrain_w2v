Photoexcited carrier
dynamics in a hematite film with and without
amorphous NiFeOx on the surface was investigated
using the heterodyne transient grating method. We found that two different
electron/hole dynamics took place in the micro- and millisecond time
regions and successfully assigned each component to the decay processes
of electrons and holes trapped at surface states, respectively. It
was also demonstrated that the amorphous NiFeOx coating plays a crucial role in increasing the survival
of the holes at the surface trap states, which was caused by the decrease
in the surface recombination rate.

1 Introduction
Hematite
has attracted great attention from many researchers because
it can work as a photoanode for water splitting that has great potential
for solar energy conversion.1−7 Even though it has been regarded as one of the most promising photoanodes
for water splitting that can potentially deliver a high solar to hydrogen
(STH) efficiency (∼15% theoretical value),7−9 its STH efficiency
of ∼1–2% prohibits its implementation.8,10 Multiple limiting factors have been proposed so far, such as poor
conductivity,11 short electron–hole
lifetime,12 and poor hole transfer efficiency1,7,13,14 among others. Particularly, the limitation on the poor hole transfer
efficiency is the main deficiency of hematite because it is believed
that the water oxidation reaction would be enhanced by facilitating
hole transfer to H2O.15,16

To overcome
the problem, there have been many attempts, such as
deposition of co-catalysts and passivation of the surface defects
on hematite, which has been regarded as a way to improve the hole
transfer efficiency of hematite by reducing the number of surface
trap states.1,7,17−22 For example, Grätzel and co-workers applied CoII onto the surface of hematite film and found that the overpotential
for water oxidation was reduced, providing a better photo-electrochemical
(PEC) performance.2 In addition, Gamelin
and his co-workers applied Co-phosphate oxygen evolution reaction
catalyst and observed a higher PEC performance than that of the CoII deposition case.23

Recently,
one of our co-authors (Wang) and co-workers investigated
hematite films coated with amorphous NiFeOx and found that it also showed high PEC performance that was attributed
to the Fermi level pinning effect.18,22,24,25 However, this line
of research was mainly focused on the investigation of the thermodynamic
aspects of the system. Although intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy
has been later employed to determine the surface kinetics with and
without NiFeOx at slower time scales,18 the kinetic information on photoexcited carriers
is still missing. This missing piece may be provided by our recent
success in studying carrier dynamics with a time-resolved technique,
the heterodyne transient grating (HD-TG). The principle of the technique
is described in Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information. For instance, using this technique, we recently observed
the carrier dynamics in a titanium oxide film, clarified the electron
and hole dynamics, and distinguished the reactive and nonreactive
carriers at the solid/liquid interface.26 As such, our primary goal for this study is to investigate the photoexcited
carrier dynamics of a hematite film and to further understand the
effect of the NiFeOx coating by the HD-TG
technique. Briefly, this technique is a time-resolved method in which
the refractive index change induced by photo-chemical or -physical
processes is monitored and is sensitive to the dipole change at the
solid/liquid interface.26−35 We found that, indeed, the amorphous NiFeOx coating plays an important role in decreasing the surface recombination
rate and increasing the number of long-lived charge carriers, which
could be attributed to the reduction in the number of surface defects.

2 Results and Discussion
A HD-TG response for a hematite
film with a NiFeOx coating in acetonitrile
(ACN) is shown in Figure 1. Because the NiFeOx-coated film
clearly exhibited all of the components
described in this study, it was selected as the reference sample.
In addition, because ACN is known as an inactive solvent, meaning
that there should be no electron or hole transfer to the solvent in
the photocatalytic process,26 it was used
as a solvent to get a reference response of a hematite film. As can
be seen in the response, it featured two different components after
a quick rise, a fast decay part from 10–6 to 10–5 s and a slow decay part from 10–5 to 10–4 s. The rising part is due to the trapping
of charge carriers to the surface states and the following relaxations
correspond to the decay or the recombination of charges. As we clarified
in a previous work,26 because the decay
responses of photoexcited carriers in particulate films of a photocatalyst
cannot be fitted with a single exponential due to a variety of features
of the carriers, such as defect or surface states, the response consists
of the sum of exponential functions with different time constants.
To analyze the time constant distribution included in such responses,
the maximum entropy method (MEM) was utilized because it yields a
continuous distribution of lifetimes of discrete exponential responses
by maximizing the entropy of the error between the observed and the
fitting results. The result is shown in the inset of Figure 1. As can be seen, two decay
components were clearly extracted, peaked at 10–5.5 (3 μs) and 10–4 s (0.1 ms), respectively.
The data support the fact that the response consists of two components.
To validate the fitting, the fitting curve obtained from the MEM analysis
was overlapped with the response. As shown in Figure S2, we obtained a good match of these two groups of
data.

Figure 1 HD-TG response of a hematite film coated by NiFeOx in ACN probed by 638 nm light. The time constant distribution
was analyzed using MEM analyses in the range of ∼10–6–10–2 s.

In the HD-TG technique, due to the similarity of the optical
setup
to the transient absorption (TA) technique, TA responses sometimes
overlap simultaneously with the response caused by the refractive
index change. To distinguish the TG response from TA responses, we
compared the dependence of the response on the transmission grating–sample
distance. (The theory for the signal sign dependence on the distance
is described in the Supporting Information.) Those data are presented in Figure S3. Whereas the slower component clearly changed the sign of the signal,
indicating that it was caused by the refractive index change, the
faster component did not. (The faster component remained a rising
curve.) This supports that the faster component originated from TA
and the slower one was caused by the refractive index change.

To confirm whether the faster and slower components were induced
by a linear process, we also checked the pump laser intensity dependence,
and the results clearly showed that both components did not depend
on the pump laser intensity. This means that they arose from a linear
process (Figure S4). In addition, we also
measured the responses by changing the grating spacing to confirm
whether the components arose from an acoustic response induced by
the heat (Figure S5). As can be seen in
the figure, it implies that the acoustic response mixed in our result
was quite small.

According to a previous study of the electron–hole
recombination
dynamics of hematite,1 TA spectra were
measured and two components at 575 and ∼700 nm were assigned
to the surface-trapped electrons and holes, respectively, and it is
probable that the two components also appeared in the observed response
in the present study because the probe wavelength (638 nm) was close
to them.

To specify the physical processes for each component,
a hole scavenger,
ethanol as a solvent, was employed, and a HD-TG response for the hematite
film with a NiFeOx coating was measured
(see Figure 2). The
black and blue responses correspond to the HD-TG responses observed
in ACN and ethanol, respectively. Because it is well known that ethanol
works as a hole scavenger,26 it is expected
that the holes trapped at the hematite surface can be removed by ethanol.
Although two components in ACN (black) were observed at ∼3
μs and ∼0.1 ms, the response in ethanol (blue) showed
only one component, the slower decay part was almost lost in ethanol.
This indicates that the slower decay component arose from the holes
trapped at the surface. MEM analyses were also employed to make the
change clearer in the lifetime distribution, as shown in the inset
of Figure 2. Both of
them showed two components with time constants of ∼3 μs
and ∼0.1 ms. Because the holes trapped at the surface are removed
by the hole scavenger, ethanol, a portion of the holes should disappear.
Even though not only the slower component but also the faster component
decreased in ethanol solvent, probably, due to the refractive index
difference between the two solvents (the TG signal intensity depends
not only on the refractive index change but also on the absolute refractive
index of the sample), the intensity ratio of the slower one to the
faster one in ACN obviously differs from that in ethanol (0.1 with
ACN and 0.03 with ethanol). Thus, we can assign the component having
the time constant of 0.1 ms to the decay of holes trapped at the surface.
According to earlier studies,1 the rate
of the hole decay was reported on the millisecond order, which agreed
with our results. The fitting response was reconstructed from the
lifetime distribution obtained from the MEM analysis and the fitting
curve, and the responses are compared in Figure S6.

Figure 2 HD-TG response of a hematite film coated by NiFeOx in ACN (black) and ethanol (blue) probed by 638 nm. The
time constant distribution was analyzed using MEM analyses in the
range of ∼10–6–10–2 s.

As mentioned before, it was reported
that the two components in
TA spectra at 575 and at ∼700 nm were assigned to the surface-trapped
electrons and holes, respectively, and we found that the faster component
was caused by the TA signal. Because we used 638 nm for the probe
laser, it is probable that the TA signal due to the surface-trapped
electrons was observed because of its broad peak width. Thus, to measure
only the component due to the holes, which was caused by the refractive
index change, we changed the wavelength of the probe laser to 785
nm and measured the HD-TG responses, as shown in Figure 3. The intensity of the responses
was adjusted to overlap each other for easy comparison. As can be
seen in the figure, it is noticeable that the intensity of the component
at ∼3 μs was almost lost when it was probed by the 785
nm laser. This indicates that the faster component observed at 638
nm was caused by the absorbance change of the surface-trapped electrons.
Thus, we can assign the component having the time constant of 3 μs
to the decay of the surface-trapped electrons. In addition, because
the rising part of the slower component clearly appeared in the response
probed by 785 nm, it can be assigned to the trapping of the holes.
Indirectly, it also means that the rising part of the faster component
might correspond to the trapping of the electrons.

Figure 3 HD-TG response of hematite
probed by 638 nm (black) and 785 nm
(red). The time constant distribution was analyzed using MEM with
the NLS method in the range of ∼10–6–10–2 s.

We were able to observe
the component from the electrons by probing
at 638 nm, whereas it was not measured in the previous report by probing
at 700 nm without applying potentials;17 thus, our result is consistent with that of the earlier study. However,
because they measured it in water, it cannot be ruled out that the
disappearance of the component arising from the electrons was caused
by the difference of the solvent. It will be clarified in our future
work, photoexcited carrier dynamics of a hematite film in water, depending
on potential and pH.

In summary, the observed carrier dynamics
of the hematite film
is illustrated in Figure 4. By the irradiation of UV light (355 nm), electrons and holes
were generated; electrons were trapped in the surface/defect states
in <1 μs, as observed in the rise time of the HD-TG response,
and holes were trapped in the surface/defect states in ∼10
μs, as observed in the rise time at the wavelength of 785 nm
in Figure 3. The trapped
electrons decayed due to the recombination process (τ: 3 μs),
and the rest of the holes were decayed by the intrinsic recombination
(τ: 0.1 ms), which can be scavenged by ethanol.

Figure 4 Schematic illustration
of the carrier dynamics of the hematite
film after UV irradiation.

To clarify the role of the NiFeOx coating
in the carrier dynamics of hematite, HD-TG responses with and without
the NiFeOx coating were compared in ACN
and are shown in Figure 5. The black and red responses correspond to those for the coated
and noncoated hematite in ACN, respectively. For the coated film,
the response showed two components arising from the trapped electrons
and holes, whereas both components decayed faster and the slower component
became weaker in intensity. MEM analyses were also employed, as shown
in the inset of Figure 5. The black and red ones correspond to the time constant distributions
of a hematite film with and without the NiFeOx coating, respectively. As can be seen in the inset of the figure,
the sample with NiFeOx showed two peaks
at 3 μs and 0.1 ms, whereas the sample without NiFeOx showed two peaks at 2 μs and 0.05 ms.
The increase in the intensity of the slower component indicates that
the number of trapped holes increased for the NiFeOx coating, whereas it did not affect the number of trapped
electrons. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the amorphous NiFeOx coating on a hematite film plays a role in
increasing the number of trapped holes at the surface because the
surface recombination was retarded. We believe that the large number
of holes can contribute to the acceleration of the water oxidation
process if the trap states exist shallowly at the surface. Even though
there is no quantitative information, we hypothesize that the reduced
recombination could be a result of reduced surface defect density.
Because of the NiFeOx coating, there should
be surface states favorable for the stabilization of the trapped holes.
This is consistent with the fact that the water oxidation is enhanced
by this coating.

constant
distribution was analyzed using MEM analyses in the range of ∼10–6–10–2 s.

3 Conclusions
We investigated the excited carrier
dynamics of a hematite film
with and without NiFeOx coating using
the HD-TG method. We assigned two components observed in HD-TG responses
to the decay of the surface-trapped electrons and holes, respectively.
We found that the number of surface-trapped holes of NiFeOx coated hematite was larger than that of the
film without the NiFeOx coating, and their
lifetime on the surface was also longer. Therefore, we concluded that
the amorphous NiFeOx coating on hematite
increases the number of trapped holes at the hematite surface and
decreases the surface recombination rate, which can improve the overall
photocatalytic oxidization of water.

4 Experimental
Section
In this study, we prepared a hematite sample based
on the solution-derived
method, which has a lower degree of structural disorder than that
of a film prepared by the atomic layer deposition method and appears
to favor growth of (110) planes. The synthesis method has already
been described previously.22 Briefly, first,
β-FeOOH was grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate (∼7
Ω/sq, Sigma) in a solution of 0.15 M iron(III) chloride hexahydrate
(FeCl3, 97%, Alfa Aesar) and 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99%, Alfa Aesar). The deposition was conducted at 100 °C
for 1 h. After rising, the annealing procedure was carried out on
the electrodes in a tube furnace at 650 °C for 2 h to convert
FeOOH into hematite. To deposit NiFeOx, iron(III) 2-ethylhexanoate (50% w/w in mineral spirits, Strem Chemicals)
and nickel(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (78% w/w in 2-ethylhexanoic acid,
Strem Chemicals) were mixed in hexane to make a 15% w/w metal complex
solution. The solution was diluted 10 times with hexane and 10 μL/cm2 was drop-cast onto the hematite electrode. After drying in
air for 5 min, the sample was treated with ozone for 3 h to remove
the organic precursors.

For the HD-TG measurement, the third
harmonic output of a Nd:YAG
(YAG) laser (355 nm, ∼1 mJ/pulse, 10 Hz, pulsewidth: 5 ns)
and a semiconductor laser (638 or 785 nm) were used as pump and probe
lasers, respectively. The grating spacing used in the present measurements
was 60 μm. The sample was pumped by the irradiation of UV light
from the YAG laser, and the response was measured via the diffraction
of the probe light. The signal was detected by a photodiode (Thorlabs,
DET110, rise time: 14 ns) and amplified by a voltage amplifier (Femto,
DHPVA). To eliminate the scattered pump light entering the detector,
a filter for cutting 355 nm light was also placed in front of the
entrance of the detector. It was monitored and recorded by an oscilloscope
(Agilent, DSO8104A, 4GSa/s).
