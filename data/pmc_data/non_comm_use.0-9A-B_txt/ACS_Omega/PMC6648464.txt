A moldable
material from a natural cationic polyelectrolyte, ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL), was prepared by mixing with two lignosulfonates
a reagent for research (L-SO3Na) and a commercially available
purified lignosulfonate (Pearllex NP). The obtained ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complexes demonstrated the ability to be tuned from a rigid form,
such as polystyrene or poly(methyl methacrylate), to a soft elastomer
form such as silicone by varying the lignosulfonate species and composition.
The maximum toughness of the complex (8.4 MJ/m3) was superior
to that of ε-PL or lignosulfonate-derived polyelectrolyte complexes.
In addition, the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex showed self-healing
properties due to the many reversible ionic bonds in the complex.
The preparation process for the novel complex was simple, involving
the mixing and drying of an aqueous solution of the polyelectrolyte
without any extra reagents (organic solvents, condensation reagents,
and cross-linker). Thus, given these many advantages and the excellent
biodegradability of the components, the ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complex is expected to be useful as a sustainable structural material.

Introduction
The extensive use of
polymers in the modern world has prompted
an urgent need for clean, sustainable biomass resources to replace
fossil-based polymers. Polymer compounds from microorganisms, which
can be obtained from renewable biomass sources via an environmentally
friendly fermentative process, show great promise as alternatives
to fossil-based complexes and have attracted the attention of many
researchers. ε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL), a commercially
available polymer produced by the Streptomyces strain,1,2 is composed of 25–35 l-lysine residues. ε-PL
exhibits strong antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria,
due to the cationic nature of the primary amino groups hanging on
its side chain.3,4 This, combined with its low toxicity
against mammalian cells,5 allows ε-PL
to be used as a food preservative.

Another potential application
of ε-PL is its use as a structural
material, given that the chemical structure of ε-PL is similar
to that of nylon 6, which has no primary amino groups on its side
chain. In fact, the glass transition temperature (Tg at 88 °C) and melting temperature (Tm at 173 °C) of ε-PL imply that it may possess
the ideal thermoplastic properties for structural applications.6 To date, the low molecular weight of ε-PL
has resulted in low moldability, thus limiting its use in structural
components, with the exception of soft hydrogel materials.7,8

In a previous study, we focused on the strong ionic interactions
between amino groups and sulfonate groups9,10 and
prepared a thermoplastic from ε-PL via formation of an ionic
complex with a sulfonate surfactant.11 The
complex formation introduced a networking structure between the ε-PL
chain via ionic bonds, allowing it to be prepared as a free-standing
sheet and as other forms. To our knowledge, this was the first example
of an ε-PL-based thermoplastic. From a practical point of view,
the tensile strength and toughness of this ε-PL-derived complex
was insufficient compared with commodity plastics or elastomers and
required further improvement before being applied as a structural
component.11

To this end, we considered
a complex formed using ε-PL and
an anionic polyelectrolyte, as opposed to low molecular weight anionic
compounds. In recent studies, good mechanical performance was demonstrated
in polyelectrolyte complexes composed of both anionic and cationic
polymers.12−14 In contrast to low-molecular-weight complexes, the
introduction of an anionic polymer to a ε-PL-derived complex
dramatically introduces a cross-linking network in the complex that
provides improved mechanical properties and elasticity.

Lignosulfonate,
a wood-derived polyelectrolyte produced in sulfite
pulping processes, has excellent biodegradability15 and is especially promising as it contains many sulfonate
groups to strongly interact with amino groups, as mentioned earlier.
We recently reported on moldable complexes obtained from lignosulfonate
and cationic polyelectrolytes.16 In this
earlier study, we produced free-standing sheets from the lignosulfonate/synthetic
cationic polyelectrolyte mixture via a simple process of mixing and
drying the mixture. The obtained complexes showed good mechanical
and self-healing properties.

Based on our earlier findings,
here, we created a novel complex
by combining the ε-PL polyelectrolyte individually with two
lignosulfonates, L-SO3Na and Pearllex NP. The resulting
bio-based complexes demonstrated tunable mechanical properties, good
moldability, self-healing, and a maximum toughness (8.4 MJ/m3) superior to those known for ε-PL or lignosulfonate-derived
polyelectrolyte complexes alone.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of the ε-PL/lignosulfonate Complex
We prepared ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complexes using two lignosulfonates
individually: a research reagent L-SO3Na purchased from
Tokyo Chemical Industry and a commercialized, purified lignosulfonate,
Pearllex NP, which has a high molecular weight (10 000–20 000
g/mol). Notably, Pearllex NP is a fractionated product of higher molecular
weight components from industrial lignosulfonates manufactured by
Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd. The mixtures of ε-PL with
L-SO3Na and Pearllex NP were homogeneous solutions; no
precipitate or aggregate was observed. The homogeneous mixture, ranging
from ε-PL/lignosulfonate = 40:60 to 60:40, was cast and dried
in a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) mold, from which homogeneous,
sheetlike samples were obtained. It should be noted that the cast
sheet from only ε-PL or Pearllex NP cracked during the drying
process; additionally, L-SO3Na by itself was too brittle
to form the intended shape (Table 1). The ionic cross-linking between ε-PL and the
lignosulfonates improved the material toughness via a “sacrificial
bond” mechanism,17,18 which effectively prevented
the corruption of the sample during the preparation of a sheet or
dumbbell-shaped test piece.

In our previous study, we fabricated an ε-PL-based
thermoplastic
by combining ε-PL and a sulfonate surfactant [sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate,
BEHS];11 notably, the ε-PL/BEHS complex
was obtained as a water-insoluble precipitate. Despite using a similar
preparation method to that used in a previous study,11 the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complexes of the present
study were distributed homogeneously throughout the aqueous solution.
Lignosulfonate is highly soluble in water; for example, L-SO3Na can dissolve more than 500 g/L of water, compared with BEHS (∼8.2
g/L of water, based on the material data sheet from the supplier).
Therefore, the homogeneity of the ε-PL/lignosulfonate mixture
would be derived from the water solubility of the components.

We also reported recently on a moldable complex from poly(diallyldimethylammonium
chloride) (PDADMACl) and L-SO3Na.16 The viscosity of the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na mixture increased
sharply during mixing. In contrast, in the current study, the viscosity
of the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex did not change significantly.
We speculate that the lower molecular weight of ε-PL (3000–4500
g/mol) compared with that of PDADMACl (200 000–350 000
g/mol) is insufficient to form a large molecular weight complex in
the mixture, leading to the observed low viscosity. Despite the differences
in water solubility and viscosity, a sheetlike material was obtained
from both the ε-PL/lignosulfonate and PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complexes. Therefore, we speculated that the ionic networks in
the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex would be sufficient to improve
the moldability of this material.

Mechanical Properties of
the ε-PL/L-SO3Na Complex
The as-fabricated
ε-PL/lignosulfonate complexes were cut
into dumbbell-shaped test pieces after sample equilibration at 50%
relative humidity. Tensile tests were performed as a function of the
composition ratio of ε-PL to L-SO3Na. The results
are shown in Figure 1a and Table 1. The
ε-PL/L-SO3Na complexes became hard and brittle with
increasing L-SO3Na content, as with the previously reported
PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex16 and
other lignin/polymer composites.19,20 A maximum
stress of 28.9 MPa was attained for the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex, using a weight ratio (ε-PL/L-SO3Na)
of 40:60; this value was 14.8-fold higher than that of the ε-PL/BEHS
complex,11 which is the only moldable material
from ε-PL referenced to date to our knowledge. Thus, the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex may be the strongest ε-PL-based moldable
material currently available. In addition, the maximum stress of the
ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex was 7.0 times that of the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex (4.1 MPa) and other reported complexes of cationic-polyelectrolyte/lignosulfonate.16 The maximum stress, Young’s modulus,
and strain at break of the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex (28.9
MPa, 1652.0 MPa, and 3%, respectively, at ε-PL/L-SO3Na = 40:60) were similar to those of polystyrene (39 MPa, 1600 MPa,
and 3%, respectively)21 and poly(methyl
methacrylate) (20 MPa, 1800 MPa, and 3%, respectively).22

Figure 1 Stress–strain curve of ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complexes.
The complexes were prepared from ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL)
and sodium lignosulfonates (a) L-SO3Na and (b) Pearllex
NP, by varying the ratio of ε-PL and lignosulfonate. All samples
were equilibrated at 30 °C and 50% relative humidity for 5 days.
The same data are summarized in Table 1.

The toughness of the
ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex was
maximized at a weight ratio of 50:50 (7.5 MJ/m3). The molar
ratio of the amino groups of ε-PL and the anionic functional
groups of L-SO3Na in this complex was estimated as 2.5:1,
based on the elemental analysis data of L-SO3Na from a
previous study.16 This value is close to
that previously reported for the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex,
in which the cationic/anionic group ratio of the complex (3.0:1) was
similar.16 The lignosulfonate molecule
has a rigid structure and a small molecular radius, due to a phenolic
backbone and covalent cross-linking. The excess amount of flexible
ε-PL chains would bridge the small, rigid lignosulfonate molecules,
which would be necessary to attain the desired strength, as with the
PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex.16 The
molar ratio of functional groups in ε-PL/L-SO3Na
and PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complexes is similar; however, the
toughness of the former was 2.1-fold higher (7.5 vs 3.6 MJ/m3, respectively). The ε-PL complex showed higher toughness than
the PDADMACl complex, despite the lower molecular weight of ε-PL
(3000–4500 g/mol) with respect to PDADMACl (200 000–350 000
g/mol).16 Comparing the chemical structures
of these two cationic polyelectrolytes, ε-PL has a primary amino
group, whereas PDADMACl has a quaternary ammonium group. It has been
reported that the interaction between sulfonate and primary amino
groups in a polyelectrolyte complex is stronger than that with quaternary
ammonium groups.23 In fact, the ε-PL/BEHS
complex is a water-insoluble complex;11 however, the PDADMACl/BEHS complex is a small micellar complex that
dissociates at low BEHS concentration.24 These findings imply a stronger interaction between sulfonate and
a primary amino group than with a quaternary ammonium group. The stronger
interaction between L-SO3Na (sulfonate group) and ε-PL
(primary amino group) than that with PDADMACl (quaternary ammonium
group) may contribute to superior stress at break and a high Young’s
modulus and toughness, despite the lower molecular weight of ε-PL.
Further studies are underway in an attempt to better understand the
mechanisms responsible for the high toughness of the L-SO3Na/ε-PL complex, to be reported in future work.

Mechanical
Properties of the ε-PL/Pearllex NP Complex
Using the
same combination of polyelectrolytes, our previous study
indicated that the molecular weight of the polyelectrolyte affected
the mechanical properties of the complex; a certain degree of molecular
weight is necessary for the material to exhibit good toughness.16 Thus, we attempted to further improve the mechanical
properties of the ε-PL-based complex using another lignosulfonate,
Pearllex NP, a commercially available lignosulfonate with high molecular
weight. We prepared the ε-PL/Pearllex NP complex and evaluated
its mechanical properties using the same methods described for the
ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex. Tensile test results for ε-PL/Pearllex
NP are given in Figure 1b and Table 1. The
complex became hard and brittle with increasing Pearllex NP content,
similar to the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex. At the composition
ratio of ε-PL/Pearllex NP of 40:60, the sample was too brittle
to form a dumbbell-shaped test piece. With increasing ε-PL content,
the complex became softer. The mechanical properties of ε-PL/Pearllex
NP at 60:40 showed the values for maximum stress, strain at break,
Young’s modulus, and toughness values of 3.8 MPa, 207%, 86.7
MPa, and 6.0 MJ/m3, respectively; these were comparable
to those of hard silicone rubber (6.7 MPa, 198%, 6.4 MPa, and 8.0
MJ/m3, respectively), with the exception of Young’s
modulus. This means that simply by changing the lignosulfonate species
and composition ratio, the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex could
take the forms of either a rigid polymer or a soft material, depending
on the desired configuration.

Focusing on the difference between
Pearllex NP and L-SO3Na, the ε-PL/Pearllex NP complex
revealed a higher maximum stress value and a higher Young’s
modulus and toughness than the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex,
at comparable compositions (Table 1). The complex with a ε-PL/lignosulfonate weight
ratio of 50:50 showed the maximum stress and Young’s modulus
values, which were improved 1.8 (from 10.0 to 17.5 MPa) and 1.4 (from
556.2 to 760.8 MPa) times, respectively, by the use of Pearllex NP.
Replacing L-SO3Na with Pearllex NP (ε-PL/lignosulfonate
= 60:40) also provided a higher maximum stress (from 3.1 to 3.8 MPa,
improved 1.2 times) and Young’s modulus (from 70.5 to 86.7
MPa, 1.2 times) (Table 1).

Most currently available industrial-grade lignosulfonates
and research
reagents contain impurities, such as sugars.25 Thus, we suspected the presence of these impurities in L-SO3Na. Considering the same amount of L-SO3Na and
Pearllex NP, the impurity sugars in L-SO3Na reduce the
amount of lignosulfonate per weight basis compared with Pearllex NP.
It is presumed that the increased effective lignosulfonate in the
complex achieved by the use of Pearllex NP would stiffen the complex
(i.e., increase the maximum stress and Young’s modulus) to
a greater degree than L-SO3Na. In addition, the toughness
of the complex was improved by the use of Pearllex NP (from 7.5 to
8.4 and 3.3–6.0 MJ/m3 at ε-PL/lignosulfonate
= 50:50 and 60:40, respectively). We considered that the higher toughness
of the ε-PL/Pearllex NP complex derives from the high molecular
weight of Pearllex NP. In fact, the strain at break with the ε-PL/Pearllex
NP = 60:40 complex was higher than the corresponding complex using
L-SO3Na (207 vs 139%, Table 1). The improvement in strain at break could not be
explained in terms of the increasing effective lignosulfonate content,
as this causes a reduction in the strain at break (Table 1). Thus, this implies that the
improved strain at break originates from the high molecular weight
of Pearllex NP, in which the molecular network and degree of molecular
entanglement are enhanced. This also agrees with the results of our
previous study with PDADMACl that has a high molecular weight.16

Effects of Relative Humidity on the Mechanical
Properties of
ε-PL/L-SO3Na and ε-PL/Pearllex NP Complexes
In a previous study, the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex softened
as the relative humidity increased due to water absorption.16 On this basis, we speculated that the mechanical
properties of ε-PL/lignosulfonate complexes would also be changed
by relative humidity. The complexes with a fixed ε-PL/lignosulfonate
composition of 50:50 were equilibrated at different relative humidity
values for 5 days, after which tensile tests were performed (Figure 2 and Table 2). The strain at break of both
complexes increased at higher relative humidity, whereas their maximum
stress and Young’s modulus decreased. This behavior is consistent
with those previously reported for PDADMACl/L-SO3Na16,26,27 and other polyelectrolytes.28 However, the water content in ε-PL-based
complexes is lower than that of PDADMACl/L-SO3Na under
comparable humidity. The water content of each complex at 60, 50,
and 40% relative humidity, respectively, is as follows: ε-PL/L-SO3Na: 13.7, 12.2, and 11.6 w/w%; ε-PL/Pearllex NP: 11.6,
9.7, and 6.7 w/w%; and PDADMACl/L-SO3Na: 25.2, 16.9, and
14.2 w/w% (Table 2 and
previous study16). The higher water content
of the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex compared with that of the
ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex is attributable to the presence
of chloride ions. The presence of salt softens the polyelectrolyte–surfactant29 and polyelectrolyte–polyelectrolyte12,13 complexes, due to weakening of the ionic interaction. Similar phenomena
would be induced in ε-PL/L-SO3Na and PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complexes by the presence of chloride ions. To check this,
we added HCl to the ε-PL/L-SO3Na mixture during preparation,
which increased the water content and softened the complex (Supporting
Information Table S2). Focusing on the
difference between L-SO3Na and Pearllex NP, the change
in the material toughness between 50 and 60% humidity was smaller
for Pearllex NP. The ε-PL/Pearllex NP complex retained 71% of
its toughness after the humidity change from 50 to 60%, whereas the
toughness of the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex declined to
27% under the same conditions. Impurity sugars in L-SO3Na, as discussed earlier, would hydrate; the hydrated water weakens
the ε-PL/L-SO3Na complex by increasing the water
content in the complex (Table 2). Given that humidity resistance is important for practical
use of these complexes in a wide range of environments, we continue
to work toward further improvements in humidity resistance via chemical
modification of the primary amino group of ε-PL.

Self-Healing Properties of ε-PL/Lignosulfonate Complexes
Many studies have demonstrated that reversible bonds in polymer
materials promote self-healing properties in the material. For example,
a self-healing material using hydrogen bonds,30 reversible covalent bonds,31 and ionic
bonds13,16 has been reported. The ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complex includes many ionic bonds; therefore, it is expected to have
self-healing properties. The two cut surfaces of the complex were
reunited, incubated at a specific humidity for 24 h, and re-equilibrated
at 50% humidity before undergoing tensile tests to assess self-healing
(Table 3). To achieve
a high healing efficiency, the ratio of ε-PL/lignosulfonate
was fixed at 60:40 (the softest composition in this study, Table 1) to promote healing.13,16 The first self-healing test was conducted at 60% relative humidity,
which is identical to the self-healing conditions of the previously
reported PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex.16 The healing efficiency, determined based on the toughness before
cutting and after healing, was 40% in ε-PL/L-SO3Na
and 29% in the ε-PL/Pearllex NP complex; this implies that the
healing efficiency of ε-PL/lignosulfonate complexes did not
reach the efficiency of the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex, which
can archive completely (approximately 100% healing).16 The ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex has a much higher
stiffness (Young’s modulus, 28.8 and 367.4 MPa in the complex
using L-SO3Na and Pearllex NP at 60% humidity, Table 1) than the PDADMACl/L-SO3Na complex (0.1 MPa at 60% humidity16). In general, in a polymer material with a high Young’s modulus,
it is difficult to achieve a high healing efficiency, due to the low
mobility of the molecular chains in the materials.32 A recent study showed the coexistence of high healing and
a high Young’s modulus (>1 GPa) using a unique hydrogen
bond
(ether-thiourea).33 As described in the
section on humidity resistance experiments, the primary amino group
of ε-PL in the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex can be modified
chemically, which allows the introduction of unique reversible bonds
into the complex. The chemical modifications can help to create an
“evolved” ecological material that combines sustainability,
biodegradability, excellent and tunable mechanical properties, and
self-healing ability based on the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex
in this study.

Conclusions
We prepared a new moldable
polyelectrolyte complex from ε-PL
and lignosulfonates by taking advantage of its ionic functional group.
To our knowledge, the mechanical properties of this complex are superior
to those of any moldable ε-PL-based materials.11 In addition, the present ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex
can be prepared from only ε-PL, lignosulfonate, and water; thus,
this complex is an excellent environmentally compatible material,
composed of biodegradable, sustainable resources and prepared using
an eco-friendly production process. The mechanical properties of the
ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex are tunable from a rigid form [similar
to polystyrene or poly(methyl methacrylate)] to a soft form (similar
to silicone rubber), simply by varying the lignosulfonate type/species
and composition of the complex. The sustainability, biodegradability,
and tunable mechanical properties of the ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complex should help to overcome various environmental problems, such
as those associated with microplastics.34,35 Furthermore,
the complex revealed a self-healing property arising from ionic interactions
between ε-PL and lignosulfonate, which is a promising function
to improve the lifetime and safety of structural materials using this
complex. In future investigations, we will focus on the healing efficiency
of the complex to further exploit this property. Thus, the ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complex is expected to expand the application field of ε-PL,
as a sustainable structural material for various commodities, building
components, and agricultural materials.

ε-PL (25 w/v% aqueous solution, 25-35
mer; molecular weight = 3000–4500 g/mol) was kindly provided
by JNC Corporation (Tokyo, Japan) as a gift. L-SO3Na containing
approximately 3.1 mmol/g-sample of anionic functional groups, including
1.8 mmol/g-sample of sulfonate groups based on an elemental analysis,16 was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo,
Japan). Pearllex NP (molecular weight: 10 000–20 000
g/mol, highly purified sodium lignosulfonate, with a higher molecular
weight) was kindly provided by Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,
Japan) as a gift. Hard silicone rubber (thickness: 1 mm; catalog No.
2-9321-01) was purchased from AS ONE (Osaka, Japan).

Preparation
of the Complexes
The ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complex was prepared by mixing an ε-PL aqueous solution (25
w/v%) with powder forms of L-SO3Na or Pearllex NP. For
the preparation with high lignosulfonate content, some amount of pure
water was added to the mixture to dissolve L-SO3Na or Pearllex
NP completely (composition details are provided in the Supporting
Information Table S1). The mixture was
cast onto a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) mold, dried in air, and
then peeled from the mold. The peeled complex was equilibrated under
controlled conditions in a humidity chamber (THR030FA; Advantec Toyo,
Tokyo, Japan). The water content of each sample was determined by
subtracting the amount of solid polymer that had been used in the
cast solution from the weight of the equilibrated sample.

Mechanical
Tests
The equilibrated ε-PL/lignosulfonate
complexes (thickness: ∼1 mm) were cut into dumbbell-shaped
test pieces according to the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) standard 37-3 [equivalent to the Japan Industrial Standard (JIS)
K-6251-8]. The test speed was 50 mm/min (EZ-LX; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan),
and the test was performed under ambient conditions. The toughness
of the sample was determined by the total area of the stress–strain
curve.

Self-Healing Tests
Equilibrated dumbbell-shaped test
pieces of the ε-PL/lignosulfonate complex (weight ratio of ε-PL/lignosulfonate:
60:40) were cut into two separate pieces using a razor blade. The
cut surfaces of the pieces were then gently pressed back together.
The reunited sample was placed into a dumbbell-shaped PTFE mold to
avoid slippage during healing. The sample in the PTFE mold was incubated
in a humidity-controlled chamber at 30 °C under a relative humidity
of 60 or 90% for 24 h of healing. After healing, the sample was re-equilibrated
at 30 °C and 50% relative humidity for 5 days. Tensile tests
of the healed samples were carried out using the same method described
above. The healing efficiency of the sample was determined from the
toughness of the samples before cutting and after healing.
