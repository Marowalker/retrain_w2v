A novel carbon material made of porous graphene-like
nanosheets
was synthesized from biomass resources by a simple catalytic graphitization
process using nickel as a catalyst for applications in electrodes
for energy storage devices. A recycled fiberboard precursor was impregnated
with saturated nickel nitrate followed by high-temperature pyrolysis.
The highly exothermic combustion of in situ formed nitrocellulose
produces the expansion of the cellulose fibers and the reorganization
of the carbon structure into a three-dimensional (3D) porous assembly
of thin carbon nanosheets. After acid washing, nickel particles are
fully removed, leaving nanosized holes in the wrinkled graphene-like
sheets. These nanoholes confer the resulting carbon material with
≈75% capacitance retention, when applied as a supercapacitor
electrode in aqueous media at a specific current of 100 A·g–1 compared to the capacitance reached at 20 mA·g–1, and ≈35% capacity retention, when applied
as a negative electrode for lithium-ion battery cells at a specific
current of 3720 mA·g–1 compared to the specific
capacity at 37.2 mA·g–1. These findings suggest
a novel way for synthesizing 3D nanocarbon networks from a cellulosic
precursor requiring low temperatures and being amenable to large-scale
production while using a sustainable starting precursor such as recycled
fiberwood.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The industrial interest
of carbon materials in any of their allotropic
forms has considerably grown in the past century due to their interesting
intrinsic physicochemical properties such as good electronic conductivity,
high chemical stability, tailorable surface properties, ease of processing,
and nonhazardous nature.1 Carbon materials
find applications in fields as diverse as thermal2 and energy storage systems,3 removal of metal contaminants,4 and organics
in water purification,5 catalyst supports,6 gas adsorption and storage,7 or biosensing.8 In the field
of energy storage, carbon materials dominate the composition of commercial
electrodes in electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs or “supercapacitors”)9−13 and of anodes for lithium-ion (LIBs)14−16 and sodium-ion batteries
(SIBs).17,18

The working principle of EDLCs relies
on physical charge separation,19 which
allows the devices to withstand thousands
of cycles without remarkable capacitance loss20,21 while delivering high power densities. For this application, mesoporous
materials of different compositions,22,23 metal–organic
framework (MOF)-derived nanoporous materials,24,25 and two-dimensional (2D) layered materials26 have shown promising electrochemical properties as electrodes for
supercapacitor applications. Notwithstanding that, carbon-based electrodes
are still receiving the most attention and dominate the commercial
market. Since the capacitance is predominantly related to the surface
area accessible to the electrolyte, intensive research efforts have
been devoted to design advanced carbon materials with tailored pore
characteristics.27,28 However, aside from either increasing
the specific surface area and storage active sites by chemical and
physical activation processes29 or attempting
to control the final surface properties by template methods,30 there is currently a new focus toward the development
of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured materials with hierarchical
and interconnected porosity due to their improved storage performance
at high charge/discharge rates.31 This
interest has aroused not only for EDLC applications but also for the
application of carbonaceous materials in LIBs32 and SIBs.33

In the case of LIBs,
one of the essential and desired requirements
for their implementation in automotive applications is a higher power
density, which enables charging the device in a short period of time
without compromising energy density. However, state-of-the-art graphite
anodes deliver extremely poor rate capabilities that cannot satisfy
such a demand whilst also arising safety concerns related to lithium-metal
plating on the anode surface.34 As for
EDLCs, nanostructured amorphous carbon anodes have shown promise in
supplying better rate capabilities35−37 when compared to graphite
anodes due to shorter lithium diffusion length paths and smaller charge
transfer resistance.

Dimensionality has proven to have a decisive
effect on electronic
and ionic transport properties of carbon materials,38 positioning layered carbon structures amongst the most
promising electrode materials.39 Nevertheless,
the main limitation of sheet-like morphologies when evaluated for
EDLC and LIB applications is that isolated sheets suffer from agglomeration
during electrode preparation as a result of strong van der Waals intersheet
interaction, limiting the area accessible by the electrolyte only
to the electrode edges rather than across the whole volume.40 For instance, in high-loaded anodes for LIBs,
the diffusion of lithium ions across the electrode is extremely poor
at high charging rates due to the high ion path tortuosity.41

This fact usually leads to a reduction
in the achievable capacitance
(EDLCs)/capacity (LIBs) compared to what is expected in relation to
the material properties. One of the main approaches to overcome the
above shortcomings and endow such materials with better electrochemical
performance is the introduction of porosity or holes onto the sheets
in order to facilitate the ionic access to the whole electrode area.42 A variety of procedures have been addressed
to produce porous nanosheets: high-energy bombardment with electrons
or ions, nanolithography and etching, liquid-phase oxidation, acid
etching with nitric acid (HNO3), guided etching with catalysts
or reactive nanoparticles,42 or chemical
activation43 and oxidation.44

Another novel strategy for shortening
ionic diffusion lengths is
the development of graphene-like nanosheets arranged into a porous
hierarchical 3D network.45−47 Some attempts already reported
to design such microstructures include template-directed deposition
or assembly of graphene,48 development
of graphene aerogels by self-assembly in freeze-drying processes,49,50 and taking advantage of the naturally developed hierarchical structure
of some biomass precursors.44

The
use of biomass resources as sustainable starting precursors
to obtain carbon materials is currently of high interest. Most biomass,
especially that coming from agricultural waste, can be seen as a renewable
resource, and thus there is interest in exploring ways to turn a waste
biomass into a high-value product.51 Porous
carbon nanosheet networks have been previously obtained from various
biomass precursors, including, for example, from cellulose via ball
milling treatment followed by KOH activation,52 from peanut skins and rice husk via a sulfuric acid-assisted hydrothermal
process followed by activation,53,54 from sugarcane bagasse
pith/chitosan by carbonization and activation with KOH treatments,43 and from soybean milk using NaCl as a template.36

Herein, a one-step process for the synthesis
of a three-dimensional
porous graphene-like carbon material is presented. A recycled cellulose
precursor was first impregnated with a saturated nickel nitrate solution
and then carbonized in a nitrogen atmosphere. Upon heat treatment,
a fast thermal decomposition causes the breakage of the original cell
wall structure of the biomass source, while nickel acts as catalyst
promoting graphitization. A subsequent acid etching process removes
the nickel particles and introduces pores into the structure. The
resulting microstructure of the carbon material, consisting of holey
graphene-like sheets, would be interesting for electrochemical energy
storage applications. The thermal behavior during pyrolysis and the
resulting microstructural features and surface properties are evaluated
with a view to their electrochemical behavior as electrodes for supercapacitor
devices and as a negative electrode (anode) for LIBs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Microstructural Characterization
Thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
analysis were performed to study the thermal behavior of samples while
heating under an inert atmosphere. Figure 1 shows the TGA and DSC analysis under nitrogen
of raw MDF precursor and MDF impregnated with an aqueous nickel nitrate
solution in comparison with that of MDF impregnated with the nickel
nitrate isopropanol-based solution previously reported in ref (55). In that paper, focused
on the graphitization of MDF wood by means of a nickel catalyst, the
authors decided to use isopropanol as a solvent instead of water to
avoid the swelling of the wood fibers and ensure the consistency of
the monolithic carbon scaffold.

Figure 1 TGA/DSC analysis using a heating rate
of 10 °C·min–1 from room temperature to
1000 °C under a constant
nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL·min–1. Comparison
between the thermal behavior of raw MDF, MDF impregnated with Ni(NO3)2 isopropanol-based solution55 and MDF impregnated with Ni(NO3)2 water-based solution: (a) Weight curve (left; solid lines) and derivative
weight loss (right; dashed lines) versus temperature during pyrolysis;
(b) heat flow curve versus temperature (black arrows point to the
exothermic reactions).

The raw MDF precursor exhibits a smooth and continuous
weight loss
at temperatures between 200 and 500 °C attributed to the decomposition
of the main polysaccharide chains of cellulosic precursors and breakdown
of C–O, C–C, and C–H bonds, leaving a solid carbon
template with ≈20–25% of the initial weight at temperatures
above 600 °C (Figure 1a). No further weight loss is observed for untreated samples,
whereas samples impregnated with an isopropanol-based nickel nitrate
solution55 exhibit a fairly similar behavior
except for a more progressive weight loss arising from the decomposition
of a nickel nitrate component (TGA/DSC analysis of a hexahydrate nickel
nitrate powder in an inert atmosphere shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information).

In contrast, samples
impregnated with an aqueous nickel nitrate
solution undergo an abrupt thermal decomposition with a large weight
loss of ≈67% at 150 °C (pointed out by arrows in Figure 1). At this temperature,
the sample weight abruptly decays from 89 to 22%. A highly exothermic
reaction can be confirmed by the DSC analysis (enthalpy of ≈360
J·g–1) shown in Figure 1b at the same temperature. From then on,
no significant changes are detected, apart from a slight weight reduction
up to ≈9% at 1000 °C. However, this remaining carbon weight
content after pyrolysis may not be representative since part of the
powdered sample was released from the alumina crucible during the
exothermic reaction. It is evident that, due to the large amount of
released energy, the actual sample temperature should be much higher
than the externally applied temperature as measured in the furnace’s
thermocouple.

The main morphological and microstructural features
were investigated
by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopy. Figure 2 shows a summary
of representative SEM micrographs of MDF-derived carbon obtained by
conventional pyrolysis and carbon obtained after impregnation with
the catalyst solution followed by pyrolysis. The typical microstructure
of MDF-derived carbon without a catalyst consists of an agglomerate
of compacted hollow cellulosic fibers with an average outer diameter
of ≈10–15 μm, as seen in Figure 2a,b. In contrast, for samples impregnated
with the catalyst, the morphology of the carbonized fibers is severely
modified after heating to as little as 300 °C, suggesting a large
inner volume expansion (SEM micrographs shown in Figure 2c,d). Instead of a dense fibrous
structure, the carbonization process transforms the original structure
to an open and highly complex three-dimensional cross-linked framework.
Inner porosity is originated by the randomly oriented stacking of
crumpled graphene-like nanosheets assembled along the fiber axis.
When the pyrolysis temperature is increased up to 1000 °C (Figure 2e), no significant
morphological changes occur, but it becomes more apparent that the
sheets’ surfaces are covered by globular nanosized particles.

a representative fiber from conventional, nontreated MDF carbon carbonized
at 300 °C; (c, d) front and side views of a representative fiber

under light contrast before acid washing, and (f) MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C after acid washing with HCl.

The interconnected sheet-like morphology is confirmed
in representative
TEM images shown in Figure 3. The microstructure obtained at a processing temperature
of 300 °C consists of a network of thin platelets stacked on
top of each other. These isolated sheets exhibit a very thin flake
morphology, indicated by the low and almost homogeneous contrast under
the electron beam, along with a large number of crumples and ripples
on their surface (edges observable by lighter contrast lines in the
dark-field (DF) image shown in Figure 3a). Due to the presence of these wrinkles, it was difficult
to establish an average value for the sheet thickness.

A close-up TEM view shown in Figure 3b reveals a homogeneous distribution of nickel
nanoparticles
(dark areas) with an average diameter of ≈4 nm at a pyrolysis
temperature of 300 °C. Combined STEM-HAADF and EDX analysis (compositional
map shown in Figure 3c) confirm the composition of the globular nickel particles over
the thin carbon matrix. Furthermore, since nickel particles are well
known to induce the graphitization of amorphous carbon materials in
situ during pyrolysis from temperatures below 1000 °C,55,56 they are surrounded by well-ordered graphitic layers formed by a
solution-precipitation mechanism as reported previously by Gutiérrez-Pardo
et al.55 The coarsening of nickel nanoparticles
at these comparatively low temperatures can be explained by a decrease
in their melting point when compared to the bulk eutectic melting
temperature (1455 °C) due to size effects and the solution of
carbon into the catalytic nanoparticles.57

When etched with hydrochloric acid (SEM image in Figure 2f and TEM images
in Figure 3d–f),
nickel
particles were fully removed from the material, leaving many in-plane
holes and pores in the carbon sheets with either spherical or faceted
shapes (further details in the next section). The catalyst concentration
in the carbon scaffold after impregnation and carbonization up to
1000 °C (as representative sample) was ≈34.9 wt %. After
acid etching, the catalyst amount fell to ≈1.6 wt % according
to ICP-OES analysis. The microstructure of the MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C sample after acid washing is similar to that reported
for few-layer graphene and graphene oxide materials56,58,59 and comparable to graphene fibers synthesized
in previous works by a wet-spinning technique,60−62 with the difference
of using a biomass resource as a starting precursor and avoiding arduous
synthesis procedures. Furthermore,
we can observe microporosity arising from nickel removal, resulting
in microstructures similar to those recently shown by holey graphene
materials.42

SEM analysis of the
fibers after impregnation but before pyrolysis
(shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information)
confirms that the impregnation with a water-based nitrate solution
enhances the swelling and debonding of the fibers in MDF wood; nonetheless,
individual fibers maintain their shape and structure, so it is expected
that the rearrangement of the microstructure takes place upon heat
treatment and it is not only a direct effect of the impregnation.

It is then clear that impregnation with an aqueous nickel nitrate
solution is not only depositing a nickel precursor onto the fiber’s
surface that later induces graphitization but also affecting the chemical
state of the wood precursor itself. Deeper insight into these changes
was obtained from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy
analysis. As shown in Figure 4, the infrared spectra of as-received MDF, prior to any impregnation
or pyrolysis, exhibit similar characteristic peaks than those of pure
cellulose.63 The absorption bands located
at ≈3330 and 1700–1500 cm–1 indicate
O–H group’s stretching and scissoring vibrations, respectively.
Bands located at wavenumbers of ≈2920 and ≈1350 cm–1 are ascribed to C–H stretching and bending
vibration modes in the glucose units. Moreover, absorption peaks at
≈1030 and 900 cm–1 correspond to C–O
stretching in secondary and primary alcohols or aliphatic ethers and
to the β-glycosidic linkages between glucose units in cellulose.64 When comparing MDF after impregnation with that
of raw MDF wood spectra, besides an increased intensity of the O–H
vibration arising from adsorbed water, significant changes are noticeable
in the region between 1750 and 750 cm–1. Three new
distinctive absorption peaks appeared within this range (at ≈800,
≈1270, and ≈1640 cm–1), related to
the different vibrations of the nitrate groups and hence confirming
the formation of N–O stretching vibrations.

and MDF impregnated with a water-based
Ni(NO3)2 solution.

The hierarchical and anisotropic wood cellular
wall structure is
characterized by the stacking of parallel elongated hollow cells aligned
along the tree growth direction. Such a three-dimensional fiber wall
structure is composed of different layers, as extensively reported
elsewhere,65 but the main components of
the wood are typically 40–50% of semicrystalline cellulose
fibers covered by hemicellulose, which represents 20–30% by
weight. Both components are bound together by an amorphous lignin
matrix that connects the wood cells and fills the space between them,
providing the wood with a structural support and mechanical strength.66 A single cellulose fiber (10–50 μm
in diameter) is itself composed of an arrangement of elementary structural
units called nanofibrils (2.5–3.5 nm in diameter for single
fibrils and 20–50 nm for aggregates67), which are bound together by van der Waals forces and intra- and
interchain hydrogen bonding.68

As
we have demonstrated, the highly exothermic reaction at temperatures
below 200 °C results in both a fast thermal decomposition and
the breakage and rearrangement of the original cell wall fibers, whereas
when samples are heated in air, they burn explosively at temperatures
below 100 °C (results not shown here). Nitro-containing compounds
are well known for their potential explosiveness, and so, for comparison
purposes, we synthesized nitrocellulose from cotton by the usual method
of esterification of hydroxyl groups with a nitric/sulfuric acid mixture
(weight ratio of 1:3)69 and studied its
FTIR spectrum (Figure S3, Supporting Information).
In this sample, the most distinctive feature is a decrease in the
intensity of the O–H stretching mode and the formation of three
intense bands at ≈1660 cm–1 (asymmetric NO2 stretching), ≈1280 cm–1 (symmetric
NO2 stretching), and ≈840 cm–1 (NO stretching) similar to those shown by MDF impregnated with a
water-based nickel nitrate solution (Figure 4).70,71

TGA results under
nitrogen support the hypothesis that the microstructural
expansion can be ascribed to the rapid and massive capillary release
of volatile matter and gases during thermal decomposition. This would
indeed lead to a sudden pressure build up inside the cellulose fiber
and the rupture of the links between cellulose chains, causing the
restacking of the cell wall to form a network of interconnected and
stacked carbon nanosheets. Thus, the explosive reaction of nitrocellulose
provides enough energy for the rearrangement of the cellulose units
and their carbonization at such low temperatures.

Similar approaches
using massive capillary release of volatile
species have been carried out to synthetize 3D porous graphene architectures72 and isolate cellulose nanofibrils through a
steam explosion process.73 A previous work
reported a morphological change of fibrous cotton to interconnected
carbon nanosheets after impregnation with magnesium nitrate, attributing
the change to the oxidation caused by release of NO2 and
CO2 compounds. In that work, much lower solution concentrations
were considered and the thermal behavior was not studied.74

2.2 Bulk Structure, Surface Chemical Composition
and Textural Properties
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements at 77 K were performed to determine surface properties
and pore size distributions. Figure 5a shows type IV adsorption–desorption isotherms
according to the IUPAC classification, suggesting a mesoporous structure
with a small hysteresis loop closing at relative pressures close to
0.4. The BET specific surface area (Table 1) at 300 and 1000 °C is ≈391
and 333 m2·g–1, respectively. These
values are up to three times higher than the value shown for conventional
nickel nitrate-treated MDF carbons using isopropanol as a solvent
at 1000 °C (≈122 m2·g–1) since the resulting carbon structure has a strongly increased accessible
porosity. The pore size distribution (shown in the inset of Figure 5a) is in good agreement
with the pores observed by TEM analysis (Figure 5b,c). At 300 °C, most of the pore volume
lies in the range of ≈2–4 nm, while, due to the coarsening
effect of nickel particles, the pore distribution at 1000 °C
becomes broader and bimodal. Despite the fact that, at 1000 °C,
most nickel nanoparticles have already formed agglomerates (Figure 3c), after acid washing,
pores with a much lower diameter can also be seen. These pores may
have been originated as a result of the fast thermal decomposition
and activation shown at 150 °C by nitrogen and oxygen species
gases. The increase in pressure can also cause nickel particles to
leave holes into the thin carbon sheets while gases are released.

while the red one represents the fitted data.

XRD and Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed
to gain
insights into the degree of crystallinity of the resulting carbon
material. Figure 5d
shows XRD patterns of MDF Ni H2O at 300 and 1000 °C.
The XRD pattern at 300 °C exhibits two broad reflections centered
at 2θ ≈ 26 and 44° similar to those of (002) and
(100) lattice planes of graphite (pdf 26-1079) with a lack of ordered
stacked regions. As the temperature increases up to 1000 °C,
the intensity of the (002) reflection peak of graphite increases,
while the full width at half-maximum decreases due to the precipitation
of graphitic structures surrounding nickel particles. Notwithstanding
that, a broad background and a shoulder are still observable at values
around 26° associated to the presence of an amorphous fraction.
No significant peaks from remaining nickel were observed.

Raman
spectra shown in Figure 5e,f exhibit three prominent bands within the 1000 to
3000 cm–1 wavenumber range. The so-called D1 band (located at 1350 cm–1, A1g symmetry) reflects the vibration of graphene layer edges in amorphous
carbons and is almost absent in defect-free graphite and graphene.
The G band (located at 1580 cm–1, E2g symmetry) originates from the in-plane stretching vibration of the
C=C double bond (sp2-bonded carbon), while the 2D
peak (located at 2690 cm–1) area, intensity, and
shape are indicative of the stacking level of graphene layers.75,76 Other defect bands indicating a disordered graphitic lattice are
the D2 band (1620 cm–1) arising from
the vibration of surface graphene layers, the D3 band (1500
cm–1) related to the vibration of amorphous regions,
and the D4 band (located at 1150 cm–1) showing the local disorder by the presence of ionic impurities.77 The intensity ratio between the D1 and G bands is indicative of the degree of graphitization, whereas
the G/2D intensity ratio accounts for the stacking level. Since these
ratios are often used to characterize structural properties, Raman
spectra were fitted using a least-squares method and pseudo-Voigt
line shapes, and main results are summarized in Table 1. Raman results reported by Gutiérrez-Pardo
et al.55 for nickel-treated MDF carbon
using isopropanol as a solvent at 1000 °C are also included in
the table for comparison purposes.

A clear enhancement in crystallinity
is obtained when increasing
the carbonization temperature from 300 to 1000 °C, noted by an
increase in the G peak intensity relative to the D1 band,
along with the separation of both bands and the narrowing of the FWHM
of the G band (data shown in Table 1). The continuous solution of amorphous carbon into
metal particles and precipitation of graphite crystals causes an increase
in the degree of graphitization with increasing treatment temperature.
The degree of graphitization α, as obtained from deconvolution
of Raman spectra, increased from 0.45 to 0.6 at 300 and 1000 °C,
respectively. These values are much higher than usual for nickel-graphitized
samples at such temperatures (at 1000 °C usually α ≈
0.3355). Interestingly, at 300 °C,
we can already observe the precipitation of graphitic regions by TEM
analysis (Figure S4, Supporting Information),
while it is well known that such an effect takes place at temperatures
above 800 °C.55,78 We attribute this early beginning
of the graphitization to the self-propagating exothermic reaction
taking place at 150 °C, which may have increased the temperature
locally.

In addition, the intensity ratio between the 2D and
G bands (I2D/IG) is about
0.19 and 0.89 at 300 and 1000 °C, respectively. These features
along with the maximum peak position suggest a few-layer graphene
structure following Ferrari et al.,76 which
is hardly differentiable from that of graphite. At 300 °C, the
characteristic 2D peak is almost absent and increases in intensity
with increasing pyrolysis temperature. In a previous work, there was
considerable debate regarding the Raman spectra of graphene-related
materials.79 The Raman spectra of ideal
monolayer graphene materials shows a strong 2D band contribution along
with a low-intensity G peak,80 whereas
the D1 peak is usually not observable in defect-free graphene.
However, the presence of defects, including wrinkles, remnant functional
groups, and porosity/holes can result in a deviation from this general
trend, when compared to mechanically exfoliated or CVD-grown graphene.
Some works showed equally intense D and G bands with no appreciable
2D band, while others reported a broad 2D peak similar to that of
amorphous carbon.81−83 Nevertheless, SEM and TEM analyses confirm a microstructure
similar to that of graphene-related materials.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed
to investigate the surface chemical composition and sp3 to sp2 carbon contribution ratio. Main results are listed
in Table 2 (spectra
shown in Supporting Information, Figure S5). Samples carbonized at 300 °C show a large oxygen content
(≈29 atom %) with a C1s/O1s atomic ratio close to 2, decreasing
to ≈11 atom % at 1000 °C (C1s/O1s ratio close to 8). Likewise,
the N atomic concentration decreases gradually from 7 atom % (300
°C) to 3 atom % (1000 °C). These reductions confirm the
almost complete removal of functional groups as the pyrolysis temperature
is increased. To gain further insights into the structure, the C1s
peak was deconvoluted into five contributions using Gaussian–Lorentzian
functions: sp2-hybridized carbon (centered at ≈284.6
eV), sp3-bonded carbon (≈285.3 eV), C–O (≈286.5
eV), epoxy and hydroxyl groups, C=O carbonyl groups (centered
at ≈287.7 eV), O—C=O carboxyl groups (∼288.7
eV), and π–π* shake-up line (≈291 eV).84 Results of these fits are shown in Supporting
Information (Figure S5). From this data,
the ratio of sp3 to sp2 contributions was estimated
to decrease from 0.36 at 300 °C to 0.26 at 1000 °C due to
the nickel-assisted graphitization, in agreement with our interpretation
of the Raman spectra.

2.3 Electrochemical Characterization
The electrochemical performance of MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C
as a supercapacitor electrode was evaluated in a symmetrical two-electrode
setup. Figure 6 summarizes
the main results. CV curves (Figure 6a) at different sweep rates exhibit a roughly rectangular
shape with small deviations at ≈0.8–1 V, suggesting
a dominant double-layer formation mechanism. Slight differences in
CV curves in terms of curve shape and area were observed when increasing
the sweep rate from 5 to 200 mV·s–1. Consistent
with these results, the galvanostatic potential profiles (Figure 6b) also show an almost
linear charging/discharging behavior, indicating little pseudocapacitive
effects.

two-electrode cell setup of MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C. (a)
Representative CV curves at different sweep rates ranging from 5 to
200 mV·s–1. (b) Typical galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves at different specific currents. (c) Variation of specific capacitance
as a function of specific current from 20 mA·g–1 to 100 A·g–1. (d) Variation of specific capacitance
as a function of cycle number, measured up to 10,000 cycles at a rate
of 2 A·g–1.

Figure 6c summarizes
the specific capacitance calculated from the GCD curves as a function
of the specific currents, ranging between 0.02 and 100 A·g–1. At the lowest studied specific current, 20 mA·g–1, a specific capacitance of 72 F·g–1 was achieved. Interestingly, the sample still shows a capacitance
of ≈55 F·g–1 at a current density of
100 A·g–1, meaning a retention of ≈75%
of their maximum capacitance even at such a high current. The small
increase in capacitance at high current densities can be attributed
to slight overshooting of the potentiostat. This can result in hydrogen
evolution that can be stored in the pores and introduce a small amount
of pseudocapacitance, overestimating the cell capacitance.85,86 More than 96% of the original capacitance was retained after long-term
cycling experiments of 10,000 charge/discharge GCD cycles (Figure 6d), indicating good
cycling stability.

Although the experimental conditions (either
in material preparation,
heat-treatment temperature, or electrochemical studies) are difficult
to compare, Table S1 (Supporting Information)
gives a comparison of previous electrochemical studies on biomass-derived
carbon electrodes for EDLC applications. For a fair comparison, data
selection of this table was based on carbon materials with similar
surface areas (below 1000 m2·g–1). The obtained capacitance values in this work at low current densities
are not impressive compared to other biomass-derived carbon materials
due to our limited surface area (≈333 m2·g–1). However, MDF Ni H2O shows good rate
capability and long-term cycling stability on account of the hierarchical
open and porous carbon structure obtained from the explosion-assisted
activation strategy.

To further investigate electrochemical
properties, the synthesized
porous nanosheets were also evaluated as an anode for LIBs, focusing
on the rate capability compared to that of commercial graphite anodes.
The electrochemical performance was assessed in a half-cell setup
(three-electrode configuration) by galvanostatic charge/discharge
experiments at a specific current between 37.2 and 3720 mA g–1 using lithium metal as a CE and RE. Figure 7a shows the delivered specific capacities
of MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C carbon at different specific
currents. The rate performance of a commercial graphite material for
LIBs was also measured for comparison purposes. Figure 7b shows the capacity retention of these anode
materials (considering that the maximum capacity (100%) is the one
achieved at a specific current of 37.2 mA·g–1) as a function of specific current to better compare the rate capability.

Figure 7 (a) Discharge
capacities of MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C
carbon electrodes compared to one commercial graphite (SMG A4) during
cycling at different specific currents. (b) Capacity retention as
a function of specific charge/discharge current. Rate performance
investigations: Cycles 1–3: 37.2 mA·g–1; Cycles 4–30: 372 mA·g–1; Cycles 31–70:
specific currents of 37.2, 74.4, 186, 372, 744, 1166, 1860, and 3720
mA·g–1 for each step (five cycles); Cycle 70
onward: 372 mA·g–1.

As can be seen, the commercial graphite exhibits
the highest achievable
capacity at a specific current of 37.2 mA·g–1 (capacity, Q ≈ 338 mAh·g–1), lower than the theoretical capacity of the maximum intercalation
stage LiC6 (≈372 mAh·g–187). The MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C sample
only reaches a maximum capacity of ≈204 mAh·g–1, related to the less graphitic structure that decreases the storage
capacity.16 However, the commercial graphite
anode shows a very poor rate capability: increasing the current up
to 744 mA·g–1 leads to a significant capacity
drop (≈137 mAh·g–1), and the capacity
retention amounts to only 40%. Furthermore, the maximum achievable
capacity at the maximum studied current of 3720 mA·g–1 is only ≈14 mAh·g–1 (4%). Such strong
capacity fading has also been reported previously by Cheng et al.88 for other commercial graphites due to the limited
and rather slow diffusion as Li+ ions intercalate via the
prismatic plane of graphite and move between adjacent graphene sheets.
In contrast, the capacity of MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C only
drops to 154 ± 4 and 72 ± 2 mAh·g–1 when increasing the specific current up to 744 and 3720 mA·g–1, retaining 35% of the maximum capacity at the highest
specific current. This good rate capability is attributed to the presence
of an interconnected and open porous structure, which allows faster
Li+ insertion/de-insertion during charge/discharge processes.
Apart from good rate capability, electrodes also show good long-term
cycling stability (Figure S6): after 200
cycles at a charge/discharge current of 372 mA·g–1, a capacity retention of 97% was maintained, while commercial graphite
only retains 75% of the capacity achieved at the beginning of the
test. However, it has to be kept in mind that reactions at the Li
metal CE might also influence the cycling performance in this cell
setup. To confirm the long-term stability, it would be necessary to
assemble LIB full cells using state-of-the-art layered oxide cathode
materials.

Although MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C exhibits
good rate
capability compared to a commercial graphite and good long-term stability
as anode for LIBs, its main drawback is related to its high specific
surface area and presumably also surface heterogeneity (cf. ref (89)) that results in a low
first cycle Coulombic efficiency (CEff90,91) of only 27 ± 1%, while the graphite electrode
exhibits an efficiency of 85% (Figure S7).

Based on these results, it is clear that, as-synthesized,
these
materials have some limitations for their application in both supercapacitors
and LIBs. However, this work serves as a preliminary study to assess
its electrochemical performance in two applications that require very
different material characteristics. From this point on, strategies
required to improve the performance in one application would result
in worse properties for the other one.

On the one hand, for
supercapacitor applications, the low surface
area (≈333 m2·g–1) limits
the capacitance value. It is expected that the larger the accessible
surface to the electrolyte, the higher the reachable capacitance.
However, our materials exhibited a limited specific surface because
our main goal was to study the effect of carrying out a simple process
of catalytic graphitization and subsequent acid washing. To improve
the surface properties, we propose a simultaneous catalytic graphitization
and chemical activation by impregnation with both a graphitization
catalyst and an activation agent, such as zinc chloride, potassium
chloride, or potassium hydroxide.92−95 This combination could allow
to achieve much higher specific capacitances compared to what was
obtained by each method separately. It is important to note that,
although the increase in the specific surface would be beneficial
for supercapacitors, it would also be detrimental for LIBs, as it
will be discussed below.

On the other hand, the low CEff obtained
in LIB experiments hinders the practical use of these anodes in an
LIB full-cell configuration (where the amount of lithium is limited
by the positive electrode material) due to the irreversible consumption
of Li ions when the SEI is formed. Viable and low-cost prelithiation
strategies (chemical, electrochemical, or prelithiation in direct
contact with metallic lithium15) could
be used in the future to compensate the active lithium losses in the
first charge/discharge cycles, therefore achieving a higher CEff. The simplest strategy to simultaneously
improve the specific capacity while decreasing the surface area would
be to increase the starting catalyst concentration. Numerous papers
have confirmed that the extent of graphitization within the carbon
material can be enhanced through an increase in the starting catalyst
concentration.96−99 Furthermore, the higher the starting catalyst loading, the lower
the surface area after acid etching due to a coarsening effect of
catalyst particles upon heating, thus allowing an increased first
cycle Ceff.96,98 An increase
in the degree of crystallinity of the samples could directly lead
to an enhanced capacity due to the intercalation of the ions into
more ordered, stacked graphene sheets. Nevertheless, it is also possible
that the higher degree of graphitization would worsen the rate capability
due to the slower kinetics of the lithium intercalation reaction.

3 Conclusions
A graphene-like porous
carbon framework was synthesized from a
recycled biomass resource by a novel, simple, and cost-effective strategy:
a modified catalytic graphitization process using a saturated nickel
nitrate water-based solution to impregnate the raw precursor. After
pyrolysis, the microstructure of the original material undergoes a
morphological transformation, resulting in randomly stacked, wrinkled
graphene-like nanosheets covered by nickel nanoparticles. By acid
etching with HCl, nickel particles were fully removed, leaving in-plane
pores into the sheets. The thermal analysis of the pyrolysis process
revealed that the raw impregnated precursor undergoes a self-propagating
exothermic reaction, which causes a fast thermal decomposition at
only 150 °C. We propose that the fast thermal decomposition at
this temperature is promoted by the high content of nitrate groups
after impregnation of the cellulosic precursor. The massive release
of the volatile matter and nitrogen functional species gases upon
thermal decomposition leads to a sudden increase in pressure, which
causes the rearrangement of the structure. In addition, nickel particles
act as a catalyst to induce graphitization at lower than usual temperatures,
resulting in highly crystalline sheets at only 1000 °C, as confirmed
by both Raman and XPS studies.

The electrochemical properties
of the carbon material as an electrode
for supercapacitors and as an anode for LIBs were investigated. The
MDF Ni H2O 1000 °C sample showed interesting rate capability
as a supercapacitor electrode in aqueous media, retaining ∼75%
of the capacitance at a specific current of 100 A·g–1 when compared to the capacitance at 20 mA·g–1. In addition, a capacity retention of ≈35% was reported when
applied as an anode for LIB cells at the highest specific current
of 3720 mA·g–1 compared to the capacity achieved
at 37.2 mA·g–1.

Although the electrochemical
properties are not impressive, it
is important to highlight the simplicity of the synthesis method.
Findings of this work suggest a novel and promising way for developing
three-dimensional graphene-like scaffolds but using a simpler, cheaper,
and eco-friendlier process than other previously reported synthesis
routes. This method requires comparatively low temperatures and is
amenable to large-scale production while using a sustainable and inexpensive
starting raw material such as recycled fiberwood. However, some strategies
should be addressed to improve the electrochemical properties of these
materials for energy storage applications, depending on the targeted
device. For its application in supercapacitors, the specific surface
area should be increased to increase the cell capacitance. However,
for application in lithium batteries, the specific surface area must
be reduced to improve the Coulombic efficiency in the first cycles.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
An industrially manufactured
wood precursor, cellulose-based medium-density fiberboard (MDF), was
chosen as the starting material.14 Prior
to pyrolysis, as-received wood pieces were first cut and then dried
for 48 h at 80 °C and later impregnated with a 3.0 M nickel nitrate
solution in deionized water (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O; purity: 99.99%; Panreac) under reduced pressure to evacuate
air and ensure full impregnation. Afterward, the samples were dried
at 40 °C for 1 week. The impregnation step helped disaggregate
the cellulose fibers so that the MDF lost its integrity. The mass
gain after impregnation was ≈25 ± 6%.

Pyrolysis
was subsequently carried out in flowing nitrogen under a heating ramp
of 5 °C·min–1 up to the desired peak temperature
followed by a holding time of 30 min and then cooling down to room
temperature. Peak temperatures used in this study were 300 and 1000
°C; however, as it was shown, a highly exothermic reaction takes
place between 150 and 200 °C, meaning that for samples heated
to a furnace temperature of 300 °C, actual temperatures can be
much higher. This exothermic reaction also helped to further disaggregate
the fibers, resulting in a loose powder as the final product.

For the development of porosity, remaining nickel particles were
removed by ultrasonic stirring in hydrochloric acid (HCl; 37%, Panreac)
followed by intensive washing in deionized water until neutral pH.
These samples are labeled as “MDF Ni H2O”
followed by a number that describes the pyrolysis temperature. MDF-derived
samples prepared through the same route but using isopropanol as the
solvent (labeled as “MDF Ni isop”) and carbon samples
prepared without a catalyst (labeled as “MDF”) were
also synthesized for comparison purposes.

4.2 Characterization
Thermal behavior
during heating in an inert atmosphere was studied by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments
(SDT-600, TA Instruments) using a nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL·min–1 and a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 up to 1000 °C. Calibration tests were periodically performed
using a standard sapphire sample. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy measurements (Two spectrophotometer, Perkin-Elmer) were
performed using the attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique, which
allows direct measurement of the as-received material without any
further preparation.

Morphological and structural characteristics
of the carbon samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM; Hitachi S5200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Talos
F2000S, FEI). Compositional analysis distribution was analyzed by
combining high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in the scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) mode. For sample preparation, carbon materials were first ground
with a mortar and pestle and then dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic
stirring. Then, a drop of the resulting dispersion was deposited on
a copper grid with a reticulated amorphous carbon film.

The
mass loading of the nickel catalyst in the carbon precursor
before and after acid etching (representative carbonization temperature
of 1000 °C) was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; SpectroBlue, Spectro).

The structural
order was characterized by Raman spectroscopy measurements
(LabRam Jobin Yvon, Horiba) using a green excitation wavelength of
532 nm. To quantify the extent of the graphitization, Raman spectra
were fitted to pseudo-Voigt line shapes, with special interest in
the integrated intensities and widths (FWHM) of the D1 (≈1350
cm–1), G (≈1580 cm–1),
and 2D (≈2700 cm–1) bands. The degree of
graphitization (α) was calculated from the integrated intensity
area of the G and D1 bands as follows: 1  The degree of graphitization
ranges in absolute values from 0 to 1. For an ideal graphite structure,
only the G band should be detected, and thus α should be 1.

X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8I-90 diffractometer) measurements
with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation within
a scanning angle (2θ) range 10–70° were used to
further assess the crystallinity of the samples. Surface properties
were determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at
77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 analyzer. Specific surface area
and pore size distributions were determined by applying Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) models to
the adsorption/desorption isotherms.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were carried
out on a Leybold-Heraeus LHS10/20 spectrometer (Al Kα1 monochromatic radiation) to study the elemental surface composition.
The binding energy was calibrated against the 1s line of carbon (284.6
eV), and after deconvolution of the C1s spectra, the sp3 to sp2 bonding ratios were determined. Curve fitting
was performed using CasaXPS software.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
4.3.1 Supercapacitor Cells
The working
electrodes (WEs) were obtained by preparing a slurry of 80 wt % carbon
as an active material, 10 wt % carbon black as a conductive agent
(Super C65, Imerys Graphite & Carbon), and 10 wt % of polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) as a binder (60 wt % dispersion in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich).
The above electrode paste was first homogeneously coated on a nickel
foam current collector (12 mm diameter, bulk density 0.45 g·cm–3, porosity: 95%, Goodfellow) and then dried at 80
°C overnight. The active mass loading for each electrode was
≈5 mg.

Symmetric supercapacitors were assembled and studied
in a two-electrode setup using Swagelok-type laboratory cells, that
is, two equal carbon electrodes and a fiberglass filter (Whatman)
as a separator. Total active mass in the device was ≈10 mg,
following best practices in the field.100 An aqueous 6 M KOH solution (85% pellets, Panreac) was chosen as
an electrolyte. In order to ensure a constant pressure between both
electrodes, a stainless steel spring was incorporated into the cell.
All experiments were carried out on a Solartron 1287A potentiostat/galvanostat
with a 1260A frequency response analyzer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
experiments were carried out at scanning rates from 1 to 200 mV·s–1 within a voltage range between 0.0 and 1.0 V. Galvanostatic
charge/discharge (GCD) experiments were performed at specific currents
from 2 × 10–2 to 100 A·g–1 in a voltage window between 0 and 1 V. Long-term cycling stability
was evaluated by 10,000 GCD cycles at a specific current of 2 A·g–1. The specific capacitance was calculated following
the equation: C = 2·I·Δt·(ΔV·m)−1, where C (F·g–1) is the specific capacitance, I is the applied
current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the voltage window, and m is the active
mass of the WE.

4.3.2 Lithium-Ion Battery Cells
The carbon
sample graphitized using nickel as acatalyst at 1000 °C was also
studied as an anode material in a half-cell configuration for LIB
cells in Swagelok-type cells. The electrode composition was 90 wt
% active material, 5 wt % Super C65 (Imerys Graphite & Carbon)
as a conductive agent, and 5 wt % sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC;
Walocel CRT 2000 PPA 12, Dow Wolff Cellulosics) dissolved in water
as a binder. The electrode paste was cast on dendritic Cu foil by
means of a laboratory-scale doctor-blade technique. The mass loading
of the active material in each electrode was ≈1.7–1.9
mg·cm–2.

Three-electrode cells were assembled
using high-purity lithium metal foil of 12 and 6 mm in diameter (Albemarle
Corporation) as the counter (CE) and reference (RE) electrodes, respectively,
and the carbonaceous electrodes as WE. GCD experiments were carried
out in a potential range between 0.02 and 1.5 V versus Li/Li+ at specific currents between 37.2 and 3720 mA·g–1: first three formation cycles at 37.2 mA·g–1 followed by 20 cycles at 372 mA·g–1 and each
five cycles at specific currents of 37.2, 74.4, 186, 372, 744, 1116,
1860, and 3720 mA·g–1, and finally, long-term
cycling performance was evaluated over 200 cycles at 372 mA·g–1. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved
in a mixture of ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/EMC, weight ratio of 3:7; supplied by BASF SE; purity:
battery grade) solvents was chosen as the electrolyte plus 2 wt %
vinylene carbonate (VC) as a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) forming
additive.101 At least three cells were
evaluated for each sample to ensure a high reproducibility of the
results, and the associated standard deviation is represented as error
bars in the figures.

For comparison in terms of rate capability,
a commercial anode
graphite (SMG A4; active mass loading of 2.3 mg·cm–2, Hitachi) with the same electrode composition was also considered
for LIB cell investigations. The BET surface area of this graphite
(data not shown here) was assessed by N2 adsorption isotherms
to be 1.58 m2·g–1. Particle size
measurements were performed by laser scattering (Cilas 1064, Quantachrome)
with a powder dispersion in water. Four repetitions were carried out,
yielding values of d0.1 (μm) = 1.78
± 0.01; d0.5 (μm) = 4.26 ±
0.02; and d0.9 (μm) = 6.81 ±
0.07; average value of 4.32 ± 0.04 μm.
