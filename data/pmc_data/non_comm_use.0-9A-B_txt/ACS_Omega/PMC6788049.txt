In this study, a
simple and facile approach was proposed to synthesize silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) loaded cation-exchange membranes (CEMs). A wide analytical
study involving scanning electronic microscopy, X-ray diffraction,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was accomplished to corroborate
that the in situ generated AgNPs were uniformly dispersed in the polymer
matrix. In addition, as a result of the proposed synthesis strategy,
the cross-linking structure inside the membrane was formed. The proper
particle size and dispersibility of the AgNPs improved the mechanical
properties of the membranes. Besides, the optimal AgNP-loaded CEM
exhibited excellent bacterial killing activities against Gram-negative
bacteria and showed a controlled improvement in the electrochemical
performance of the prepared membranes. These effects were caused by
the obtained distribution of AgNPs near ion-exchange groups that increased
the aggregation of water molecules around them, improving the efficiency
of ion transport due the formation of array broad ion-transport channels.
The optimized CEM [sulfonated polysulfone (60SPSF)-C3#-Ag-2] exhibited
an enhanced NaCl removal ratio of 67.5% with a high current efficiency
(96.9%) and a low energy consumption (5.84 kWh kg–1). The distance of the inhibition zone from the boundary of the membrane
of SPSF-C3#-Ag-2 reached 4.8 mm. These results led us to suggest that
the proposed synthesis strategy may have potential applications in
the field of antibacterial and desalting ion-exchange membranes.

1 Introduction
One of the most pervasive
challenge afflicting researchers around
the world is the deficient access to prevent biofouling when using
membrane technology.1−4 Taking into account their intrinsic physicochemical
surface characteristics,3,5 traditional cation-exchange
membranes (CEMs) are highly prone to biofouling even in humid air
conditions. By secreting extracellular polymers, the bacteria will
adhere to the surface of the membrane, resulting in an increase in
membrane resistance, reduction in ion-transport efficiency, increase
in energy consumption (EC), and restriction of useful membrane life,
which dramatically affect the membrane performance in industrial application.
Although adding buffer to the stack for the cleaning or replacement
of the membranes is a valid method to solve the above problems, it
will eventually increases the operating costs.4,6−10

Addressing the
problem attracts a numerous amount of research to explore methods
of purifying water using membrane technology at lower cost and with
less energy while minimizing the use of chemicals and impact on the
environment.

Besides, to mitigate the membrane bacterial fouling
from the water source, modification of membrane material itself is
still one of the most effective methods. The presence of agents such
as chitosan, capsaicin, nanosilver, nanocopper, nanozinc dioxide,
graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc. embedded in the polymer matrix improves
the antibacterial and conductivity properties of doped membranes.11−13 Among them, silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) are widely used as a metal-type antibacterial agent in electronic
products, biosensors, food industry, cosmetics, medical equipment,
and other industries.14 Zhang et al.15 successfully immobilized nanosilver particles
(AgNPs) on the surface of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane
using poly(acrylic acid). The static contact angle test showed that
dispersed AgNPs provide a significant improvement to the hydrophilic
character of membranes. Besides, antibacterial experiments confirmed
that the modified PVDF membranes exhibit good bioflocculation resistance.
Eribo et al.16 integrated polystyrene sulfonate
(PSS), polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, and AgNPs as stable thin
(15 nm) layer into polyethers. The results showed that the combination
of AgNPs and PSS increased the hydrophilicity and enhanced the biocidal
property of the modified membranes.

However, the traditional
method for preparing AgNPs is complicated, and the chemical reagents
used are mostly toxic and not eco-friendly.

Thus, in situ synthesis
methods have emerged in recent years. Shen et al.17 coated a polydopamine (PDA) layer on the surface of pristine
anion-exchange membranes, and then Ag was reduced by PDA with 2,5-diaminobenzene
sulfonic acid grafted onto PDA layer. The modified AEMs exhibited
a significant inhibition effect on Escherichia coli. Besides, Shen et al.18 fabricated a
“sandwich”-like structure [composed of PDA and poly(sodium
4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS)/hydroxypropyltrimethyl
ammonium chloride chitosan–nanosilver particles (HACC-AgNP)
on a commercial AEM]. The results are indicative of the available
antibacterial activities of E. coli. However, in general, the in situ synthesis methods for fabricating
AgNPs are limited by the attachment of Ag+ and reductant,19,20 which results in AgNPs being only modified on the membrane surface,
such as surface grafting, layer-by-layer assembly, in situ covalent
surface functionalization, and so on.15,16,19,21−38

In addition to surface modification, known for the combination of
the advantages of polymer and inorganic materials, incorporation of
nanomaterials into matrix of ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) have drawn
a lot of interest for offering IEMs with new remarkable properties.11,12

However, as for traditional mixed matrix membranes, AgNPs
should be prepared first19,39−41 and then blend with the casting
solution during the process of fabrication, which is complex and not
effective in dispersing nanoparticles uniformly in the membrane (Scheme 1a). Therefore, it
is worth exploring to find a simple process for preparing AgNPs to
modify the membrane.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram of (a) the Process of
CEMs Formation
in This Study Compared with (b) the Traditional Method of Mixing AgNPs
into the Casting Solution to Form Doped Membranes
The photon quantum reduction method is
to reduce silver ions by the electrons generated in the solution after
ultraviolet light irradiation.41 During
the reaction, less Ag nucleus are initially produced, and the reduced
Ag is continuously deposited to form a cluster of atoms with uniform
particles. Furthermore, it will be more efficient to reduce AgNPs
by combining the chemical method with the UV induction.39,42 In this study, a simple method based on UV radiation technology
is accomplished to directly synthesize AgNPs while cross-linking structure
is formed in the polymer matrix. Through the ion-exchange process,
Ag+ is absorbed near the −SO3–. After UV treatment, the in situ generated AgNPs are uniformly dispersed
in the polymer matrix, avoiding the problem of agglomeration caused
by the postmixing procedure (Scheme 1b). The prepared CEMs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX). Besides, their physicochemical, electrochemical, and
antibacterial properties were also investigated. The chosen optimal
silver nanoparticle-loaded cross-linked membranes have a lower electrical
resistance, higher current efficiency (CE), and lower energy consumption,
with potential applications in the field of antimicrobial membranes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of in Situ
Synthesis of AgNPs in the Prepared CEMs
It is observed from Figure 1a,b that AgNPs were
successfully synthesized in the sulfonated polysulfone (60SPSF)-C3#-Ag-3
CEMs, and their uniform dispersion and nanometric size (about 20 nm)
were competent to access a good coordination with membrane matrix.
As can be seen from Figure S1, when the
addition amount of AgNO3 was low (60SPSF-C3#-Ag-1), fewer
AgNPs were generated. As the addition of AgNO3 increased,
consequently the amount of generated AgNPs was higher. The 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2
and 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-3 samples exhibited uniform NP distribution characterized
by a good dispersion without aggregation and with a narrow size distribution.20,29−31,43 The presence AgNPs dispersed
not only onto the surface but also inside of the membrane, determining
the surface hydrophilicity and induced microphase structure of hydrophilic/hydrophobic
separation in CEMs, which was crucial for the ion-transport behavior
in the performance of IEMs.43,44 The optimized sample
with excellent dispersion and decoration was 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2. Figure 1c exhibits the diffractograms
of the prepared CEMs with different amounts of AgNPs [60SPSF, 60SPSF-C3#
and 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-X (X = 1–3)].
The plane located observed at 20° was ascribed to the polymer
structure. The diffractograms associated to AgNPs exhibited peaks
at 38, 45, 65, and 78°, which were associated with the crystalline
planes 111, 200, 220, and 311, respectively.43 Besides, strong silver signals of the nanoparticles were detected
from XPS (Figure 1d).
As expected, the binding energy peaks at 368 eV (Ag 3d5/2 orbital) and 374 eV (Ag 3d3/2 orbital) were obviously
observed in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ag peaks, further
affirming the successful formation of AgNPs.20Figure 2 illustrates
the mechanism of the preparation of AgNP-loaded CEMs and their digital
pictures.

2.2 Mechanical
Properties of Membranes
The mechanical properties of polymer
nanocomposites depended on the dispersion of nanoparticles within
the polymer matrix and the interfacial bonding established between
the nanofiller and the polymer matrix,44,45 which was suitable
for AgNP-loaded CEMs. To investigate the effects of loaded AgNPs in
the polymer matrix on membrane’s mechanical properties, the
analysis of the tensile strength and elongation at break properties
was carried out. Table 1 summarized the tensile strength and elongation at break of the prepared
CEMs. As expected, the tensile strength was enhanced after cross-linking
(60SPSF-C3# compared with 60SPSF). Furthermore, it was observed that
the incorporation of AgNPs to the polymer structure improved the membrane’s
mechanical behavior to some degree. As the addition of AgNO3 increased, and consequently the amount of loaded AgNPs was higher,
the mechanical properties of the cross-linked membranes were accordingly
improved. The tensile strength and elongation at the break of 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-1
reached 21.85 MPa and 22.35%, respectively, better than that of 60SPSF-C3#
(18.46 MPa, 23.25%), whose pliant mechanical structure was formed
because of the cross-linking. Besides, the mechanical properties of
60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2 were better than those of 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-1 as a consequence
of a more uniform distribution of AgNPs with moderate size. However,
the performances of 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2 and -3 were almost the same because
of the limitation of the amount of light energy and the cross-linking
agent, which acted as a reducing agent, causing the saturation of
the amount of AgNPs generated. This effect also revealed the successful
synthesis of AgNPs inside the membrane structure. This method, which
did not require postphysical mixing, has simple operability and uniformity.

60SPSF-C3#-Ag-3	23.87	25.97	
2.3 Determination of Ion-Exchange
Capacity (IEC), Water Uptake (WU), and Linear Expansion Ratio (LER)
IEC, WU, and LER of the prepared membranes were strongly affected
by AgNPs at room temperature. It was observed that the IEC of AgNP-loaded
CEMs strongly decreased compared to that of the primary sample (Figure 3), which was likely
due to the formation of AgNPs and the addition of cross-linking agents.46,47 Moreover, both WU and LER significantly decreased after cross-linking
as shown in Figure 4. Besides, the WU and LER of AgNP-loaded CEMs increased compared
to that of 60SPSF-C3# due to the presence of AgNPs, which promoted
changes in the internal humidification. However, the cross-linking
structure significantly decreased the free volume, thus water molecules
were hindered by the membrane inside, suppressing the effects of hydrophilicity
of AgNPs to a certain extent, which was particularly effective at
higher temperatures. Besides, all of the samples have higher WU and
LER, exhibiting a positive correlation with the increasing temperature
(Figure 4). The most
significant changes in the WU and LER values for the selected temperature
interval (from 20 to 70 °C) were observed for 60SPSF-C3# in comparison
with the pristine membrane. The successive incorporation of NPs into
the membrane structure slightly alters both WU and LER for modified
membranes, but both are evidently, showing an apparent increasing
trend as the added amount of NPs is increased. AgNP-loaded cross-linked
membranes may offer an effective application in electrodialysis (ED)
considering its appropriate WU (25–50%) from 20 to 60 °C.48

2.4 Determination of Membrane’s Electrochemical Properties
Area resistance and transport number of the prepared CEMs were compared
with those of commercial membranes (Figure 5). It was observed that the conductive performance
of CEMs decreased after cross-linking. The explanation can be associated
to the effects promoted by the cross-linking structure formed, which
efficiently diminished the free volume and resulted in a higher hydrophobicity,
restricting the ion transport and hence causing the area resistance
to increase.49−51 The
values observed for modified CEMs decreased in the following order
60SPSF-C3#-Ag-1 > 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2 ≈ 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-3 (from
1.58 to 1.42 and 1.39 Ω cm–2, respectively).
As the AgNPs are loaded, the membrane surface resistance was reduced
and the transport number increased. The AgNPs near the sulfonate ion
increase the hydrophilicity, promoting the adsorption of water, improving
the internal humidification, broadening the ion-transport channels,
and forming an adequate connection of internal channels.43,49,52 The cation transport mechanisms
in CEMs before and after AgNP loading can be demonstrated in Figure 6. Donnan exclusion
was enhanced and the permselectivity significantly improved due to
the effects mentioned above, which promoted the transport of counter
ions through the internal phase.

Figure 6 Schematic representation
of the cation-transport mechanism
in CEMs without (a) and with (b) AgNP loading.

In ED application, when the
applied current reaches a certain value, concentration polarization
is generated, where transfer of ions is depleted at the interface
between the membrane and the solution. As a result, the voltage across
the boundary layer will be extremely increased, resulting in water
splitting and causing a higher energy consumption as well as a lower
current efficiency. To operate electrodialysis under suitable condition,
the limiting current density of ED-fabricated CEMs needs to be tested.
As Figure 7 shows,
the curves directed by the test all show three regions: one Ohmic
region and two non-Ohmic regions;53 the
second indicated that the water began to dissociate. After cross-linking,
the limiting current density of the CEMs decreased; however, as the
AgNPs were loaded, the value was increased. It can be explained that
the lower membrane resistance and suitable ion channels reduced the
difference of ion-transport velocity between the membrane inside and
the solution, thereby increasing the limiting current density. The
AgNP-loaded CEMs showed a higher limiting current density than the
commercial membrane. The result suggested that 15 mA cm–2 was suitable for application in desalinating experiment.

2.5 Antibacterial Properties
of Prepared CEMs
The AgNP-loaded membranes have antibacterial
properties, so bacteria cannot grow in their vicinity. As can be seen
from Figure 8, the
bacteria
adhered to the membrane surfaces of 60SPSF (Figure 8a) and 60SPSF-C3# (Figure 8b), around which was full of bacteria. On
the other hand, the inhibition zone appeared around 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-X (X = 1–3), and its size increased
with the increase of Ag loading. The distance of the inhibition zone
from the boundary of the membrane of SPSF-C3#-Ag-X (X = 1–3) reached 2.5 mm (Figure 8c), 4.8 mm (Figure 8d), and 4.9 mm (Figure 8e). The reason why the distances
of 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2 and -3 were similar was because the amount of reduction
of AgNPs in this experiment reached extreme value. This suggested
that silver ions were possibly released from the membranes when ionized
in aqueous medium.19,26,32,40 Increasing the concentration of AgNPs significantly
enhanced the antibacterial property. While the similar loaded amount
of AgNPs in SPSF-C3#-Ag-2 and -3 resulted in their bacteriostatic
effect per unit time to be similar, leading to similar diameters of
the inhibition zone. It was worth noting that the largest total antimicrobial
diameter of the sample in this study was 2.4 times the width of the
sample itself, with the performance better than that of the surface-modified
AgNP membranes in our previous work (about 2 times).17 The above results indicated that the AgNP-loaded membranes
exhibited excellent antibacterial properties.

and (e) 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-3.

2.6 Electrodialysis
According to the
observed results (Figure 9a,b), there was a possible tread that the AgNP-loaded CEMs
have excellent ion transport properties. During the experiment, the
conductivity in the dilute chamber became less and less, which means
that the ions gradually migrate into the concentration chamber. Besides,
the ion migration in the dilute chamber lacking the load current caused
the voltage to gradually rise. After a certain time, the AgNP-loaded
CEMs began to show their intrinsic properties: the conductivity of
the dilute chamber decreased more quickly compared with the ED fabricated
with other kind of CEMs. Among them, as indicated by the previous
results, 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-1 and -2 exhibited the best performance. This
was because the proper connection structure brought by AgNPs increased
the speed of ion transport.43,54,55 After 2 h of experimentation, the salt removal ratios of 60SPSF-C3#-Ag-1,
-2, and -3 were 65.1, 67.5, and 68.1%, respectively, all of which
were higher than that of 60SPSF without any modification (Figure 9c). In the case of
60SPSF-C3#, despite the ameliorative three-dimensional structure,
the increase of the charge density improved the desalination performance
to some degree. The presence of AgNPs further enhanced the ion removal
ratio, which was in agreement with the filler content. The 60SPSF-C3#-3
exhibited the highest current efficiency but the lowest energy consumption
(Figure 9d), which
was associated with its moderate water absorption, swelling ratio,
electrical resistance, and higher transport number. In addition, the
performance of all AgNP-loaded CEMs surpassed that of the commercial
CEM (NEOSEPTA CMX), indicating a good option for commercial application.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a simple and facile approach has been explored to
fabricate AgNP-loaded CEMs. Through the ion-exchange process and UV
induction, the in situ generated AgNPs were uniformly dispersed in
the polymer matrix, avoiding the problem of agglomeration caused by
the postmixing common procedure. The incorporation of AgNPs into the
polymeric CEMs combined the advantages of the both materials. The
proper particle size and dispersibility of the AgNPs improved the
mechanical properties of the membranes. The AgNPs synthesized near
the ion-exchange groups increased the aggregation of water molecules
and broaden the ion-transport channels, contributing to an adequate
connection of ion channels. The chosen optimal AgNP-loaded CEM exhibited
excellent bacterial killing activities against Gram-positive bacteria
and offered a controlled improvement in electrochemical performance.
The optimized CEM (60SPSF-C3#-Ag-2) exhibited enhanced NaCl removal
ratio of 67.5% with a high current efficiency (96.9%) and a low energy
consumption (5.84 kWh kg–1). The distance of the
inhibition zone from the boundary of the membrane of SPSF-C3#-Ag-2
reached 4.8 mm. This study provided a practicable strategy for the
in situ AgNP generation and potential applications of membranes in
the field of antibacterial materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Sulfonated polysulfone
(60SPSF, designated in our previous work, Mw = 86 000, polydispersity index = 2.24) was provided by Yanjin
Technology Co. Ltd. (China). The purification process was as follows:
the raw material was first dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), filtered through a sand core
funnel (G4), precipitated, and vacuum dried at 120 °C for 24
h. Besides, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (97%) was purchased from
Macklin, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-diphenyl-phosphine oxide (TPO, 97%)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and silver nitrate (99.8%) and sodium
nitrate (99.0%) were provided by Aladdin. Organic solvents N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and ethyl
alcohol (99.7%) were provided from Lingfeng Reagent Co. Ltd. and Anhui
Ante Food Co. Ltd., respectively. Reagents used in the test including
sodium chloride (99%), potassium chloride (99%), and sodium sulfate
were from Aladdin (China). Commercial IEMs including AEMs (type I,
Fuji film, Japan) for electrodialysis test and CEMs (NEOSEPTA CMX,
Asahi Kasei Corporation, Beijing) for performance comparison were
used in this study.

4.2 Preparation of the Cross-Linked CEMs with in Situ AgNPs
The cross-linked CEMs with in situ AgNPs were synthesized by solvent
evaporation inversion initiated by UV radiation method. The AgNPs
were simultaneously generated when three-dimensional network structure
of polymer was formed. For the in situ anchoring of AgNPs in the blend
of CEMs, 1 g of 60SPSF (sufficiently decontaminated) was stirred in
10 mL of DMAc at 60 °C until completely dissolved. And then,
the additives containing 0.05 g of silver acetate, 0.25 g of ethylene
glycol diacetate, and 0.05 g of TPO were added to the solution at
room temperature with continuous stirring for another 3 h to allow
the exchange of Ag+ with dissociated K+ from
−SO3– groups (SPSF membrane matrix).
Ultimately, the casting solution was pour onto a self-made mold and
exchanged Ag+ was further reduced into the metallic state
(Ag) due to the presence of electron and reducing radical group induced
by UV treat (Scientz03-II). The ultraviolet wavelength used was 365
nm, and the power of the UV lamp was 40 W. All samples were treated
for 20 min and then immediately placed in a vacuum drying oven to
evaporate solvent. After the dry samples were washed with ethyl alcohol
for three times, the samples were soaked into 0.5 M sodium nitrate
solution for 24 h to exchange unreacted Ag+. The CEMs using
AgNO3 with 0.125, 0.250, and 0.500 g were designated as
60SPSF-C3#-Ag-X (X = 1–3),
respectively.

4.3 Membrane
Characterization
4.3.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS),
and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The results of XRD
were characterized using an X’Pert PRO (PANalytical, Netherlands)
instrument with Cu Kα radiation with a 0.02° step at room
temperature. The prepared CEMs were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD, Japan). Also, the anode
was mono [Al (Mono)] (45 W). The morphologies of the prepared CEMs
were characterized using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi
S-4800) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.

4.3.2 Mechanical Properties Measurement
Tensile strength and elongation at break of membrane samples (2 ×
6 cm2) were determined by automatic mechanical analyzer
(CTM2050).47

4.3.3 Ion-Exchange Capacity (IEC)
Ion-exchange
capacity refers to the amount of ions that can be exchanged per unit
volume or mass of ion-exchange material, which determines the ion-transport
rate during electrodialysis to some extent. Before testing, 1 M HCl
aqueous solutions were prepared with samples soaked for at least 24
h to ensure that the counter ions were totally converted to H+, followed by three rinses with deionized water to remove
excess H+. Subsequently, 1 M NaCl aqueous solution was
prepared where the samples were soaked for 24 h. Ultimately, potentiometric
titration (T50) purchased from Mettler Toledo was utilized to titrate
the concentration of H+ in the solution. Also, the IEC
was measured from eq 1(42) 1  where V, cH+, and Wdry represent the volume of NaCl solution, the concentration
of H+, and the dry weight of samples, respectively.

4.3.4 Determination of Water
Uptake (WU) and Linear Expansion Ratio (LER)
WU reflected
the intrinsic water combined with the reactive group in the membrane,
and linear expansion ratio referred to the change of the area before
and after the membrane sample was soaked into the solution under certain
conditions. In the process of testing, deionized water was first prepared
with the samples soaked in until an equilibrium was obtained at distinct
temperature. Also, then a filter paper was used to remove moisture
outside the samples. After accurate values of weights and sizes were
recorded immediately, the samples were dried in a vacuum drying oven
to evaporate water. Ultimately, the parameters of the samples (both
weight and sizes in wet and dry conditions) were recorded. WU and
LER were measured from eqs 2 and 3(47) 2   3  where Wwet and Wdry are the weight of the samples in wet and
dry conditions, respectively. Lwet and Ldry are the average length  of the
samples in wet and dry conditions, respectively; Lwet1, Lwet2 and Ldry1, Ldry2 are the lengths
and widths of the samples in wet and dry conditions, respectively.

4.3.5 Membrane Surface
Area Resistance
Membrane surface area resistance depended
on the electromigration velocity of the counter ions in the membrane
and provides some information for the microstructure. Two compartments
were designed in the testing device, between which is fixed a membrane
container filled with 0.5 M NaCl solution. Also, 0.3 M Na2SO4 solution was circulated in electrode cells. The applied
current was 0.05 A. Before testing, 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solutions were
prepared with samples soaked for at least 12 h. The voltage between
two silver chloride electrodes (V) was determined by a digital multimeter.
Ultimately, membrane surface area resistance was measured by the following
equation (eq 4) 4  where Em (with sample assemble) and E0 (without sample assemble) are the testing voltage (V)
between two silver chloride electrodes; I is the
operating current (A); and S is the testing CEM’s
valid area (cm2).

4.3.6 Determination of Transport Number and the Limiting Current Density
The transport number characterizes the selective permeation performance
of the membrane for counter ions. Before testing, 0.15 M KCl solutions
were prepared with samples soaked for at least 12 h. During the test,
two middle compartments were filled with two kinds of KCl solutions
(0.1 and 0.2 M, respectively). The voltage between two silver chloride
electrodes (V) was determined by a digital multimeter. The transport
number t̅ was measured from eq 5 5  where Em is the the testing voltage (V)
across the membrane and E0 is the voltage
between two kinds of KCl solutions (0.1 and 0.2 M, respectively).

The polarization current–voltage curves of ED stack fabricated
with the prepared CEMs were measured by an electrochemical workstation
(Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N). In this test, 0.2 M NaCl aqueous solution
was used as a feed solution and 0.3 M Na2SO4 was used as an electrode solution, which was circulated using a
pump.

4.3.7 Antibacterial
Properties
Gram-negative E. coli was selected as the model bacteria in this test. The inhibition
zone method was used to measure the antibacterial activity of the
prepared membranes. Before testing, Luria–Bertani (LB) agar
plates (containing 10 g L–1 of peptone, 5 g L–1 of yeast extract, 10 g L–1 of sodium
chloride, and 16 g L–1 of agar at pH of 7.0) were
prepared, on which sterilized samples were placed. Also, then the
LB was cultivated with E. coli (concentration
of 106 cfu mL–1) and incubated at 37
°C overnight. The distance of the inhibition zone from the boundary
of the membranes in the sample disks were measured finally.

4.3.8 Electrodialysis
A four-cell device was used to evaluate the desalting performance.
The four cells include a concentrate cell, a dilute cell, and two
electrode cells. The volume of the two middle cells was 80 mL and
NaCl solution (0.5 M) was filled in at the beginning of the test.
At the start of the test, 0.3 M Na2SO4 solution
was circulated in electrode cells, and the conductivity of the solution
in two middle cells and the stack voltage were recorded every 10 min.
The testing CEM’s valid area was 19.625 cm2, and
the applied current was 0.3A (15 mA cm–2). The NaCl
removal ratio (%), current efficiency (CE, %), and energy consumption
(EC, kWh kg–1) of ED with CEMs were measured from eqs 6 to 8(47) 6   7   8  where δ0 and C0 are the content and concentration
in dilute cell (0.5 M NaCl in this experiment), respectively; δt, Ct, and Vt are the content, concentration, and volume
in dilute cell at time t, respectively; I is the operating current value and U represents
the voltage of the ED stack; Z, F, and N represent the absolute valence of Na+, Faraday constant, and number of repeating units (N = 1), respectively. Besides, Mb is the molecular weight of NaCl.
