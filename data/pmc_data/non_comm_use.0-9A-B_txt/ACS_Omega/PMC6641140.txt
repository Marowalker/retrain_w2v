Lipid rafts and membrane-active
peptides are attracting attention
because they help understand basic membrane functions. In addition,
we focus on flavoproteins playing some physiological roles and explore
the model compounds. In this study, we demonstrate that a new flavin
probe, composed of palmitoylated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and its
complementary PNA labeled with flavin, targets the liquid-ordered
(lo) microdomains and disrupts its interfaces to liquid-disordered
(ld) microdomains of giant unilamellar vesicles and can be visualized
by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Surprisingly, as shown
in time-lapse images, vesiculation and probe aggregations appear in
the lo–ld interfaces, which leads to local disruption of the
membrane. We discuss a possible interpretation of the data based on
a comparison with control experiments.

1 Introduction
Membrane-active
peptides are attracting attention because their
study helps increase our understanding of basic membrane functions
such as transport and signaling and because of the potential applications
of such peptides in biomedicine.1−5 Peptide–membrane interactions have been investigated, and
some peptides have been shown to initiate pore formation and to disrupt
membrane structures.6−12 Cell membranes are known to form microdomain structures (lipid rafts)
that serve as platforms for specific recruitment of proteins related
to transportation and signal transduction.13,14 Many attempts have been made to explore model membrane systems constructed
from liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) domains, and a
mimic of a raft domain of the former has been developed.15−18 Recent advances in the development of fluorescent probes and the
use of confocal microscopy have enabled visualization of micrometer-sized
lo and ld domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).19−24 Indeed, remarkable fluorescent probes that exploit the self-assembly
properties of complementary oligonucleotides, lipophilic nucleic acids,
allow controlled targeting and immobilization of specific molecules
and liposomes on membranes.25−28 Membrane-anchored peptide nucleic acid (PNA) (in
a defined sequence of PNA_C16 in the literature: Pal-Lys(Pal)-Gly-Glu2-Gly-ttc ttc tcc tt-Glu2-Gly-CONH2,
in which Pal refers to a palmitoyl chain) partitioning exclusively
into lo domains of model membranes and visualization by hybridization
with the fluorescently labeled complementary DNA strand have been
reported.25,26

In this study, we demonstrate a new
flavin probe that can be used
to target lo domains and disrupt lo–ld interfaces of GUVs and
that can be visualized by using confocal laser scanning microscopy.
The flavin probe is composed of PNA_C16 and its complementary PNA
labeled with flavin (Flavin–PNA) (Scheme 1). We focused on this probe as we explored
the model compounds for flavoproteins playing some physiological roles.
Here, we report the design of a Flavin–PNA, PNA_C16/Flavin–PNA
hybrid, the preparation of GUVs using an electroformation method,
the observation of domain distribution, and its time-lapse features.
The findings suggest that the labeled PNA duplex has the potential
to be used in the elucidation of membrane-active peptides and for
application in medicine, especially in acting at the interface between
lo and ld domains of a cell.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Flavin
Probe Partitioned into the Lo
Domains of GUVs
Palmitoylated PNA (PNA_C16) and
its complementary PNA labeled with flavin (Flavin–PNA) partition
preferentially into the lo microdomain of the lipid raft model membrane.
This scheme corresponds to the situation immediately after the addition
of Flavin–PNA.

2 Results
and Discussion
Initially, to assess the partitioning into
the lo domain of the
flavin probe, the sample was observed immediately after the addition
of Flavin–PNA by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Figure 1 shows the confocal
fluorescence images of GUVs composed of micrometer-scaled domains
with an incorporated PNA_C16/Flavin–PNA hybrid. According to
the red fluorescence image, Texas Red–1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (TR–DHPE) almost
exclusively partitioned into the ld domain (Figure 1b). In contrast, the green fluorescence of
flavin on the PNA_C16/Flavin–PNA hybrid was observed in the
opposite domain, that is, the lo domain (Figure 1a). This result is consistent with the reported
preference of the hybrid,25 although in
previous studies, the GUVs were prepared from different lipid mixtures
and rhodamine-labeled DNA was used.

Figure 1 Confocal fluorescence and differential
interference contrast images
of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)/cholesterol (Chol) GUVs
with incorporated PNA_C16 and recorded immediately after the addition
of Flavin–PNA. The distribution in the lo domains of GUVs is
verified by the green fluorescence of flavin (a). The opposite ld
phases are labeled by TR–DHPE as red fluorescence (b). From
the differential interference contrast image (c) and the merged image
(d) of (a) and (b), the domains remain stable. Scale bars are 10 μm.

To gain insight into the influence
of the PNA_C16/Flavin–PNA
hybrid flavin probe on GUV domains, we observed the sample as time
elapsed. Figure 2 shows
the differential interference contrast image and the merged fluorescence
images of flavin and TR–DHPE in the GUV domains at 10 min after
the addition of Flavin–PNA. The results demonstrate a significant
disruption of the lo domain, especially at the boundary between lo
and ld domains, which appears as irregular regions in Figure 2a and corresponds well to the
yellow parts as a partition of both flavin and TR–DHPE probes
in Figure 2b. Elaborating
on the irregular regions, the flavin probes are distributed slightly
on the inside of TR–DHPE, and the regions are brighter than
the natively structured lo domains, which indicates that PNA_C16/Flavin–PNA
may favor self-assembly and the redistribution process (leading to
large aggregations) rather than the remaining heterogeneous distribution
with DPPC and Chol in the lo domains. Almost coincidentally, the TR–DHPE
probe seems to adhere to the exterior of the GUVs at around the ld–lo
interfaces. At 30 min after the addition of Flavin–PNA, the
aggregated structure covers a large area of the GUV, which disrupts
the lo–ld interfaces, although the membrane is resistant as
a whole (as shown in Figure 3). Additional images of different GUVs and time-lapse images
focused on a GUV are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S4), which also demonstrate
the behavior of the flavin probe targeting the lo domains and disrupting
the lo–ld interfaces in about 30 min.

Figure 2 Differential interference
contrast image and merged image of fluorescence
by flavin and TR–DHPE in the GUV domains at 10 min after addition
of Flavin–PNA. The images exhibit a significant disruption
of the lo domain as small pores in (a) corresponding to yellow parts
in (b). Scale bars are 10 μm. Additional images are shown in Figure S2.

Figure 3 Differential interference contrast images and merged images of
fluorescence by flavin and TR–DHPE in the GUV domains at 30
min after the addition of Flavin–PNA. (c) and (d) are 3D images
corresponding to (a) and (b), respectively. The natively structured
lo domain was nearly abolished. Scale bars are 10 μm. Additional
images are shown in Figure S3.

To clarify the origin of the observed behavior,
control experiments
were performed; the results are provided in the Supporting Information. The control experiments were performed
simultaneously to reflect only the difference between labeled DNA
(with Alexa Fluor 488, AL488–DNA) and Flavin–PNA. Confocal
fluorescence and differential interference contrast images of GUVs
for the control experiments are shown in Figure S5, which indicate that the lo domains remained stable at 30
min after the addition of AL488–DNA. Furthermore, testing of
PNA labeled with AL488 (AL488–PNA) revealed the same behavior
as that of Flavin–PNA (Figures S6–S8), which suggests that the disruption was derived from the PNA duplex.
For confirmation, the conditions both before the addition of labeled
PNA and with replacement of a flavin molecule, such as riboflavin
tetrabutyrate, were also examined, which showed negative results for
disruption and supported the disruption by the PNA duplex (Figures S9 and S10). The partial disruptions
were observed not only in the lo–ld interfaces but also in
the single-phase (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,
POPC) membrane (Figures S11–S14).
The POPC membrane also shows brighter spots, most likely aggregates
of the labeled PNA duplex. Therefore, the PNA_C16/labeled PNA duplex
incorporates into the membrane where it causes aggregation leading
to local disruption. Consequently, a possible interpretation for DOPC/DPPC/Chol
GUVs is that after the PNA_C16 distributed in the lo domains forms
a duplex with the labeled PNA, its redistribution into the lo–ld
interfaces is induced favorably by the compatibility with the local
membrane curvature, whose processes may contain self-assembly, bending,
and folding of the PNA duplex like a protein. Inversely, the interfaces
are affected by the PNA duplex and take on larger differences in membrane
curvatures, which may lead to vesiculation (according to some differential
interference contrast images), and subsequent adhesion and aggregation
of TR–DHPE on the generated vesicles.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel fluorescent probe including a flavin moiety
was demonstrated to partition preferentially into the lo microdomains
of a lipid raft model membrane and disrupt the interfaces between
lo and ld domains. The probe was composed of palmitoylated PNA (PNA_C16),
and its complementary PNA labeled with flavin (Flavin–PNA)
was used to reveal its location. Surprisingly, the probe disrupted
the lo–ld interfaces as shown in the time-lapse images, in
which vesiculations and aggregations of both probes, the labeled PNA
duplex and TR–DHPE, appeared. From the control
experiments with labeled DNA instead of labeled PNA showing that the
lo domains remained stable, the vesiculations and probe aggregations
may be induced by the redistribution of the PNA duplex and its forming
large curvatures in the lo–ld interfaces. The imaging described
here has potential for the future development of identification and
characterization of membrane-active peptides acting at the interfaces
between lo and ld domains due to ease of chemical use and modification.

4 Experimental Section
GUVs were prepared from a mixture
of DOPC, DPPC, and Chol in a
2:2:1 mole ratio and produced by an electroformation method. To the
lipid mixture, 0.05 mol % (relative to the lipid mixture) of TR–DHPE
was added, which is known to be a probe with a preference for the
ld domain.20,21 After the formation of GUVs,
ca. 0.1 mol % (relative to the initial amount of lipid mixture) of
PNA_C16 was added to the vesicle suspension, which was incubated at
40 °C for 1 h, and then Flavin–PNA was added. By using
time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy, the GUVs were observed
after the addition of Flavin–PNA (see the Supporting Information).
