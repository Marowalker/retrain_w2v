Bacterial
multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious healthcare issue
caused by the long-term subtherapeutic clinical treatment of infectious
diseases. Nanoscale engineering of metal nanoparticles has great potential
to address this issue by tuning the nano–bio interface to target
bacteria. Herein, we report the use of branched polyethylenimine-functionalized
silver nanoclusters (bPEI–Ag NCs) to selectively kill MDR pathogenic
bacteria by combining the antimicrobial activity of silver with the
selective toxicity of bPEI toward bacteria. The minimum inhibitory
concentration of bPEI–Ag NCs was determined against 12 uropathogenic
MDR strains and found to be 10- to 15-fold lower than that of PEI
and 2- to 3-fold lower than that of AgNO3 alone. Cell viability
and hemolysis assays demonstrated the biocompatibility of bPEI–Ag
NCs with human fibroblasts and red blood cells, with selective toxicity
against MDR bacteria.

Introduction
Pathogenic bacteria
with acquired resistance are responsible for
millions of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide.1 In the United States alone, annually 2 million
patients are victimized by hospital-acquired infections with 99 000
annual deaths, causing economic burden of $35 billion a year.2,3 Significantly, ∼60% of nosocomial (hospital-related) infections
in the United States are caused by multidrug resistance (MDR) bacteria.4,5 Recently, in developing countries like Pakistan, 71% infections
of newborn babies are caused by MDR bacteria. Initially, the development
of new antibiotics2 and antibiotic combinations
was sufficient to address different pathways of resistance simultaneously.3 However, these strategies are changing the pattern
of antibacterial resistance in a predictable manner, resulting in
the loss of efficacy of current clinical treatments.6

The prominent clinical reason for the development
of MDR bacterial
strains is the long-term, subtherapeutic exposure of microbes to antibiotics.7,8 Multidrug-resistant “superbugs”, both Gram-positive
(such as Enterococcus faecium) and
Gram-negative (including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter) species,
lead to serious community health hazards. However, continuous rise
of multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains drives the search
for new antimicrobial agents and methods to control the growth of
MDR bacterial strains. The eventual goal of these studies is to develop
cost-effective, potent, safe, readily available, and easily synthesized
alternatives to the conventional antibiotics that are increasingly
becoming ineffective against MDR pathogens.9−11

Targeting
bacterial membrane using cationic, hydrophobic nanoparticles
(NPs); peptidoglycan-recognizing agents; metals; and inhibitors of
ATPase can provide an efficient strategy to control these superbugs.12−14 Nanoparticles provide an efficient platform to target MDR bacteria
owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio, facile surface modification,
and controllable size.15,16 The nature of the core material,
size, and surface chemistry play significant roles in the antibacterial
properties of nanoparticles. Metals, especially silver (Ag), have
promising antimicrobial potential arising from dissolved Ag+ ions that are effective against a wide range of MDR strains.17 Decreasing the size of NPs improves their surface-to-volume
ratio, leading to an enhancement in their dissolution and hence antimicrobial
activity.18−20 Surface charge is also important, with cationic nanoparticles
serving as efficient self-therapeutic antimicrobial candidates that
induce cellular membrane disruption.21,22 This ability
to lyse bacteria with reduced mammalian cell toxicity involves the
adjustment in the proportion of surface charge and hydrophobicity.12,21,23 Increasing the biocompatibility
of cationic antimicrobial agents through a rational design by encapsulating
bioactive molecules using biocompatible polymers24 like polyamidoamine,25 chitosan,
and branched polyethylenimine (bPEI)26 is
an attractive research direction in this regard.27,28

Combinations of antimicrobials can synergistically increase
the
therapeutic efficacy.29 We therefore set
out to use a combination of PEI and silver in the form of silver nanoclusters
(Ag NCs) to target MDR bacteria.30 In this
work, we synthesized blue fluorescent cationic silver nanoclusters
coated with low molecular weight bPEI (bPEI–Ag NCs) and characterized
these polymer-coated nanoclusters using optical measurements and electron
microscopic techniques. The prepared nanoclusters demonstrated pronounced
antibacterial activity against 12 multidrug uropathogenic (pathogens
associated with urinary tract infections) strains of bacteria. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and the live/dead bacterial staining
assay showed that bPEI–Ag NCs target bacteria through the membrane
disruption mechanism. Significantly, these nanoclusters exhibited
minimal hemolysis toward red blood cells and low toxicity against
mammalian cells, making them promising therapeutics for bacterial
infections.

Results and Discussion
The bPEI–Ag NCs were
synthesized through a one-pot, single-step
reaction (Figure 1)
and were further characterized for their absorption and photoluminescence
properties, sizes, and morphologies.

Figure 1 General scheme for the synthesis of bPEI-coated
Ag NCs (bPEI–Ag
NCs) and their antibacterial action.

The solutions of bPEI–Ag NCs were light yellow under
visible
light and displayed blue fluorescence under UV illumination at 365
nm. The absorption spectrum showed two absorption bands at 268 and
354 nm (Figure 2a).
The absorption peak at 354 nm corresponds to the oligomeric silver
species. The absence of the surface plasmon resonance band of larger
Ag NPs between 400 and 500 nm indicates the formation of smaller Ag
nanoclusters.31 The maximum fluorescence
emission of bPEI–Ag NCs was 430 nm at an excitation wavelength
of 365 nm, which confirms the synthesis of silver nanoclusters (Figure 2b).32 The hydrodynamic size of these nanoclusters was found to
be ∼3 nm (Figure 2c) with a ζ-potential of +30 mV (Figure S1). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
analysis revealed isotropic and spherical morphology of Ag NCs with
an average core diameter of ∼2 nm (Figure 2d). The amount of elemental silver in the
bPEI–Ag NC solution was determined to be 8.95 μg/mL (Supporting Information) using inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry.33 This estimation
will be helpful to target concentrations of controls to make the antibacterial
assay more reproducible.

acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.0–9.0). (b) Photoluminescence spectrum

and emission at 430 nm. (c) Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis

The antibacterial activity of cationic bPEI–Ag NCs
was explored
against lab strains of P. aeruginosa (ATCC 19660, Gram-negative) and Amycolatopsis azurea (Gram-positive) and 12 uropathogenic clinical MDR isolates (Table 1). The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of bPEI was 32 nM, whereas that of AgNO3 was around 2–0.125 nM against different lab strains. The
MIC of bPEI-coated Ag NCs was, however, found to be 2- to 3-fold better
than that of AgNO3 alone (Figure S2). bPEI–Ag NCs could selectively suppress the growth of these
pathogens, with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 0.015 nM. Functionalized
bPEI–Ag NCs could inhibit the growth of resistant superbug
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at a concentration as low as 0.015 nM. Similar MIC values
for clinical MDR and lab strains suggest that bPEI–Ag NCs could
possibly share the common mechanism of targeting bacterial resistance.34,35 The antibacterial activity of bPEI–Ag NCs can be attributed
to the cationic nature of surface ligands composed of hydrophobic
segments that facilitate the contact of bPEI–Ag NCs with bacterial
cells that causes membrane damage, as well as the release of Ag+ ions from the bPEI–Ag NCs. The increased surface area
of the bPEI–Ag NCs could increase the sustained dissolution
of the Ag+; a process distinctively different from a burst
release of Ag+ ions when directly used in the form of AgNO3.36 The bactericidal activity of
PEI due to its cationic nature adds to the bactericidal activity along
with Ag+, resulting in the observed broad-spectrum antibacterial
activity of bPEI–Ag NCs.37,38

The selectivity of antimicrobial
agents to bacteria as opposed
to mammalian cells is essential for their therapeutic efficacy.39 bPEI–Ag NCs showed low dose-dependent
cytotoxicity against fibroblasts. IC50 for bPEI–Ag
NCs against fibroblasts was 38 nM (Figure 3), indicating their safe therapeutic window.

Figure 3 Cell viability

NCs) to test their cytotoxicity against fibroblasts.

Hemolysis assays were performed to examine the
biocompatibility
of bPEI–Ag NCs with human red blood cells, as RBCs are highly
susceptible to lysis upon systemic administration of nanomedicine.33 In the complete range of MIC concentrations
of bPEI–Ag NCs against bacteria (0.25–0.015 nM) (Figure S3), silver nanoclusters showed minimal
hemolytic activity. HC50, the concentration of Ag NCs required
to lyse 50% of RBCs, was much higher than ∼500 nM, with the
resulting therapeutic index (HC50/MIC) > 2000 (500/0.25).
This indicates that these Ag NCs can be injected safely through blood
without causing hemolysis of the RBCs. Previous studies on hemolysis
by PEI and silver ions indicate that the polymer shows high hemolytic
activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations, whereas bPEI–Ag
NCs show minimal hemolytic activity, as shown in Figure 4, further corroborating the
biocompatibility of Ag NCs.40 The observed
high selectivity of bPEI–Ag NCs against bacterial cells may
be attributed to the bacteria having more negatively charged surface
than that of the mammalian cells. Moreover, mammalian cell membranes
are highly stabilized because of the presence of cholesterol that
makes them less vulnerable to antimicrobial metal NCs.41,42

NCs) to test their compatibility with red blood cells.

After establishing the biocompatibility of Ag NCs
with RBCs and
mammalian cells, we further probed the bactericidal nature of Ag NCs
using the live/dead assay. In this experiment, E. coli cells (1 × 108 cfu/mL) were incubated with bPEI–Ag
NCs to a final concentration of 40 nM for 2 h at 37 °C, followed
by staining with live/dead assay reagents. Confocal laser microscopic
images (Figure 5) showed
bacterial cells with compromised membranes of dead bacterium. Calcein
acetoxymethyl ester crosses the intact membranes of live cells and
is converted into calcein, a green fluorescent molecule, inside the
viable cells as in (a), whereas propidium iodide (PI) can only enter
the cells with compromised membranes, resulting in red florescence.
The strong red florescence of cells (b) treated with bPEI–NCs
indicated compromised bacterial membranes. The simultaneous monitoring
of viable and dead cells is shown in Figure 5c.

and propidium iodide
(PI). (a) E. coli as control: viable
cells emit green fluorescence at 490 nm λex and 515
nm λem. (b) E. coli incubated for 2 h with polyethylenimine silver nanoclusters (bPEI–Ag
NCs): dead cells emit red fluorescence at 535 nm λex and 617 nm λem. (c) Merged image of viable and
dead cells.

Next, we studied the
interaction of bPEI–Ag NCs with the
bacterial membrane; the morphology of Ag NC-treated bacteria was studied
using TEM. Microscopic observation of E. coli cells treated with bPEI–Ag NCs clearly revealed their abnormal
morphology, whereas untreated bacterial cells as control appeared
normal (Figure 6a).
bPEI–Ag NC-treated cells appeared to be stressed, and membrane
distortion was observed. The probable mechanism for the interaction/penetration
of bPEI–Ag NCs through the bacterial membrane is the formation
of breaks called pits.30 The pit formation
has been observed for E. coli using
scanning TEM (STEM) (Figure 6b).43,36 The morphology was completely
changed with total loss of integrity after 8 h (Figure 6c).44 These Ag
NCs act by forming a direct contact with the bacterial membrane, without
penetrating deep into their cells, resulting in the failure of antibiotic
resistance of bacteria, and are thus potential candidates to address
serious global healthcare challenges like MDR because they might be
less prone to resistance than antibiotics.45

Conclusions
In
summary, branched polyethylenimine silver nanoclusters were
synthesized by a chemical reduction method and are found to be potential
candidates to target MDR in various pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains
of bacteria. They showed multiple-fold improved bactericidal effects
compared to those of controls, which is attributed to their smaller
size, surface chemistry, and cationic nature. The bPEI–Ag NCs
act as broad-spectrum antibiotics by targeting bacteria using the
membrane disruption mechanism with limited toxicity against mammalian
and red blood cells. They have broader implications of crafting nanocapsules
to carry and deliver drugs against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections,
in vivo, because of the combinatorial effect. These bioinorganic bPEI–Ag
NCs, therefore, have the potential to provide therapeutics for antibiotic-resistant
pathogens.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Hyperbranched
polyethylenimine (bPEI) (Mr 800, 99%),
silver nitrate, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), formaldehyde (30 wt %), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS
7.4 pH), and dialysis membranes (molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 1
kD) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the solvents used in
this study were of analytical grade. Millipore water with a resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ was used to prepare all of the aqueous formulations.
All bacterial strains were harvested in the Cooley Dickinson Hospital
Microbiology Laboratory (Northampton, MA). NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658)
and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (DMEM;
ATCC30-2002) were purchased from ATCC, and fetal bovine serum (SH3007103)
was purchased from Fisher Scientific.

Characterization
A UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu; UV-1800) was used to measure UV–visible absorption
spectra of bPEI–Ag NCs in 200–800 nm range. Fluorescence
measurements of bPEI–Ag NCs were carried out using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplate reader (PerkinElmer; Enspire
2300). Transmission electron microscopic analysis was performed using
a JEOL 7C transmission electron microscope operating at 80 keV. The
sample for TEM was prepared by slowly evaporating a dilute drop of
clean bPEI–Ag NCs onto a 200-mesh carbon-coated copper grid.
The interaction of bacteria with Ag NCs at different time intervals
was studied using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI;
Nova Nano SEM-450) equipped with a STEM detector operating at 10 kV.
The samples for SEM were prepared by placing a drop of a dilute solution
of bPEI–Ag NCs, incubated with bacteria, on carbon-coated copper
grids, followed by air-drying. The bacteria on copper grids were then
fixed using 2.5% solution of glutaraldehyde (prepared in normal saline),
followed by subsequent dehydration using a series of acetone dilutions,
i.e., 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100% for 10 min each.46 The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of bPEI–Ag
NCs were performed using a Zetasizer system (Malvern, Nano ZSP).

Synthesis of Polyethylenimine Silver Nanoclusters (bPEI–Ag
NCs)
bPEI–Ag NCs were prepared using a modified silver
mirror reaction. Briefly, 1 mL aqueous solution of PEI (0.094 g),
50 μL of HEPES (1 M), and 950 μL of H2O were
vigorously stirred for 2 min followed by a dropwise addition of 2.5
mL of AgNO3 (0.01 M). Silver ions were first sequestered
in bPEI forming a bPEI–Ag complex, which is resistant against
reduction under basic conditions (pH 9.0) even with NaBH4. The pH was adjusted to 7 with the HEPES buffer, resulting in a
change of solution color from colorless to light yellow because of
the formation of a complex. At neutral pH, the reduction potential
for the Ag+/Ag system is 0.799 V, whereas that for Ag(NH3)+/Ag is 0.379 V.26,47,32 Formaldehyde (100 μL) (30%) was then slowly
added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min at 70 °C.
PEI can etch the larger Ag NPs to smaller Ag NCs; hence, upon prolonged
incubation of the reaction mixture (24 h), polyethylenimine silver
nanoclusters (bPEI–Ag NCs) were obtained.48 The bPEI–Ag NCs were purified by dialysis in deionized
water using a 1 kD (MWCO) membrane for 24 h and stored in the dark
at 4 °C for further use. UV–vis absorption spectra of
bPEI–Ag NCs show absorption peaks at 268 and 354 nm, which
correspond to Ag NCs; however, pure PEI shows only one absorption
peak at 260 nm, which overlaps with that of the absorption of glass
cell. The Ag NCs were synthesized at 70 °C, and the absorption
peaks at 268 and 354 nm due to Ag NCs were disappeared upon further
increasing the temperature and a new absorption peak emerged at 400
nm (surface plasmon resonance), which corresponds to silver nanoparticles.
The complete wavelength scan showed that the corresponding excitation
and emission wavelengths for bPEI–Ag NCs were 375 and 430 nm,
respectively. Pure PEI also displayed similar excitation and emission
peaks, but the fluorescence intensities were about 1/60th of those
exhibited by bPEI–Ag NCs.

In Vitro Studies
The antibacterial activity of bPEI–Ag
NCs was measured as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) through
the broth dilution method. MIC is the minimum concentration of the
chemical required to prevent visible growth of bacterium. For this
purpose, different bacterial strains (Table 1) were grown overnight in the lysogeny broth
and their optical density (OD) was measured at 600 nm after washing
them with PBS to separate viable bacteria. bPEI–Ag NC solutions
of eight different concentrations in the range of (16–0.03
nM) were prepared by serial dilution. The Ag NCs were incubated with
5 × 105 cfu/mL bacteria for 16 h in an incubator at
37 °C and 275 rpm. The media and bacteria without bPEI–Ag
NCs were employed as negative and positive controls, respectively.
Finally, after 16 h, the OD was measured again at 600 nm to check
the concentration of living bacteria.12,49

Cell Viability
Assay
A total of 20 000 NIH 3T3
(ATCC CRL-1658) fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% bovine calf serum (BSA) and 1% antibiotics
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for
48 h. Old media was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) before the addition of bPEI–Ag NCs in prewarmed
10% BSA in media. The silver nanoclusters and cells were then incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell viability was determined using the alamar blue assay
following the manufacturer’s protocol.50 Briefly, cells washed with PBS were treated with 220 μL of
10% alamar blue in BSA serum containing media and incubated at 37
°C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 3 h.
After incubation, 200 μL of solution from each well was transferred
into a 96-well black microplate. Red epifluorescence intensity, resulting
from the alamar blue solution, was measured (excitation/emission:
560/590 nm) using a Spectro Max M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices)
to determine the cellular viability. Cells without bPEI–Ag
NCs were considered as 100% viable. Each experiment was performed
in triplicate.

Hemolysis Assay
Citrate-stabilized
human whole blood
(pooled, mixed gender) was purchased from Bioreclamation LLC, NY,
and immediately processed. For this purpose, 10 mL of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) was added to the blood (2 mL) and centrifuged at 5000
rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully discarded, the red blood
cells (RBCs) were dispersed in 10 mL of PBS, and the solution was
kept on ice during the procedure. The RBC solution (0.1 mL) was added
to 0.4 mL of the bPEI–Ag NC solution in PBS in a 1.5 mL centrifuge
tube (Fisher) and mixed gently by pipetting. RBCs incubated with PBS
and water were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.
All bPEI–Ag NC samples as well as controls were prepared in
triplicate. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with
gentle shaking at 150 rpm. After incubation, the solution was centrifuged
at 4000 rpm for 5 min and 100 μL of the supernatant was transferred
to a 96-well plate. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured
at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Spectra Max M2, Molecular Devices)
with absorbance at 655 nm as a reference.44
