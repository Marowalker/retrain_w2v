The pH dependence
of the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine p-nitroanilide has been studied at
25 °C. kcat/KM was maximal at alkaline
pH values but decreased with decreasing pH. kcat/KM was dependent on free enzyme
pKa values of 6.75 ± 0.09 and 4.10
± 0.13, which were assigned to the ionization of the active site
histidine-57 and aspartate-189, respectively. Protonation of either
group abolished catalytic activity. kcat is shown to equal the acylation rate constant k2 over the pH range studied. k2 decreased on the protonation of two groups with pKa values of 4.81 ± 0.15 and 4.23 ± 0.19. We
assign the pKa of 4.23 to the ionization
of the aspartate-189 residue and the pKa of 4.81 to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate formed during
acylation. We conclude that during acylation, breakdown of the catalytic
tetrahedral intermediate is rate-limiting and that there is a strong
interaction between the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 and the oxyanion
of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate, which perturbs their pKa values. From the pH dependence of k3, we conclude that deacylation depends on a
pKa of 6.41 ± 0.22 and that the ionization
of the carboxylate group of aspartate-189 does not have a significant
effect on the rate of deacylation (k3).
A catalytic mechanism is proposed to explain the pH dependence of
catalysis.

1 Introduction
Trypsin and trypsin-like serine proteases specifically catalyze
the hydrolysis of peptide bonds involving the carbonyl carbon of the
α-carboxylate group of the positively charged amino acid residues
lysine or arginine. Trypsin is a serine protease involved in protein
digestion. Due to its high specificity for positively charged amino
acid residues trypsin is widely used for peptide sequencing in proteomics.1,2 Trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in a range of biological
processes and diseases, e.g., the trypsin like enzyme urokinase plasminogen
activator plays an important role in both fibrinolysis3 and cancer progression.4,5 In this study,
we utilize pH studies to investigate the catalytic mechanism of trypsin.

Catalysis by the serine proteases can be described by the minimal
three-step kinetic mechanism (eq 1) below 1  where ES is the
Michaelis complex and ES′
is the acyl intermediate. Ks is the disassociation
constant of the Michaelis complex (Ks = k–1/k+1 =
[E][S]/[ES]). k2 and k3 are the first-order rate constants for acylation and
deacylation, respectively. Catalysis obeys the Michaelis–Menten
equation (d[P]/dt = kcat[E0][S0]/([S0] + KM)). The Michaelis parameters are complex assemblies of
rate constants with kcat= k2k3/(k2 + k3) and KM = k3[(k–1 + k2)/k+1]/(k2 + k3), and if k–1 ≫ k2, then KM = k3Ks/(k2 + k3) and kcat/KM = k2/Ks. Therefore, the mechanistic significance of the pH dependence
of these Michaelis parameters is often not clear. However, pioneering
studies with chymotrypsin at pH 76 have
shown that with ester substrates with good leaving groups (P1) deacylation (k3) is rate limiting and
so  while with amide and anilide substrates with
poor leaving groups (P1), acylation (k2) can be rate limiting with  Therefore, with highly reactive ester substrates,
it should be possible to determine k3 from kcat values, while with less reactive amide or
anilide substrates, it should be possible to determine k2 and Ks values from kcat and KM, respectively.

At pH 2.66, the reaction of trypsin with the reactive ester substrate
Z-lys-pnp was slow enough for both k2 and k3 to be measured and it was shown that acylation
was much more rapid than deacylation (k2/k3 = 27.6).7 However, it was found that at higher pH values, the ratio k2/k3 decreased and k2 was not much greater than k3.8,9 Therefore, it cannot be assumed
that k2 is always very much greater than k3 with reactive ester substrates and so pH studies
are essential if we are to fully understand the kinetics of catalysis
at different pH values. The less reactive para-nitroanilide substrates
are thought to be better models than the more reactive para-nitrophenol
ester substrates for natural peptide substrates. However, a detailed
kinetic analysis of the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the equivalent
less reactive para-nitroanilide substrate Z-Lys-pna has not been carried
out.

Therefore, in the present study a detailed study of the
trypsin-catalyzed
hydrolysis of the anilide substrate Z-Lys-pna has been undertaken.
The effect of pH on the ratio k3/k2 and on values of KM and Ks has been quantified. Also, the
effect of pH on kcat/KM and on the rates of acylation (k2) and deacylation (k3) has been
determined. From these studies, the pKa values affecting catalysis in the free enzyme as well as during
acylation and deacylation have been determined. In any pH study, it
is difficult to dismiss the possibility that ionizations outside the
active site can also affect catalytic activity. However, in this study,
there is no evidence of this and all observed ionizations are assigned
to active site groups.

The mechanistic significance of these
results are discussed and
a catalytic mechanism is proposed, which explains the pH dependence
of catalysis. The mechanistic proposals and their background are briefly
summarized in the following paragraph.

Some earlier studies10−14 have suggested that the pKa of the catalytic
histidine is decreased during acylation (pKa < 7), while more recent studies15−23 have suggested that the histidine pKa must be raised (pKa > 11) so that
it
can be an effective general base catalyst during acylation and that
the pKa of the oxyanion of the catalytic
tetrahedral intermediate (THI) is lowered so that trypsin can be an
effective enzyme at physiological pH values. In the present work,
pKa values of 4.8 and 4.2 were detected
from the pH studies of the acylation step of catalysis (k2 in eq 1). The pKa of 4.8 is assigned to the
oxyanion of the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate formed during acylation
and not to the pKa of the catalytic histidine
that is assigned a pKa > 11 in ES and
the tetrahedral intermediate. Aspartate-189 that binds the ε-amino
group of the substrate in the S1 specificity pocket is
assigned a pKa of 4.1–4.2 and is
not significantly perturbed on substrate binding or on tetrahedral
intermediate formation during acylation.

2 Results
2.1 Determination of the Catalytic Parameters kcat, kcat/KM, and kcat/KM at Different pH Values
The Michaelis
parameters kcat,KM, and kcat/KM for the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna were determined
by computer-fitting the initial rate data obtained at a given pH to
the hyperbolic form of the Michaelis–Menten equation (d[P]/dt = Vm·[S0]/([S0] + KM)) using the method of Wilkinson.24

Examples of the experimental data and the fitted
lines are given in Figure 1. The trypsin concentrations were increased at lower pH values
to compensate for the decreases in kcat and kcat/KM. KM values increased as the pH decreased,
and so higher substrate concentrations were used for determining KM values at lower pHs (Figure 1).

0.005 μM s–1, 463 ± 34 μs–1, 0.394 ± 0.027 mM.

2.2 Effect of pH on kcat/KM for the Trypsin-Catalyzed Hydrolysis
of Z-Lys-pna
kcat/KM values were determined by dividing Vm/KM values by the enzyme
concentration in the reaction mixture. kcat/KM values were dependent on the sequential
ionization of two groups (kcat/KM = (kcat/KM)max/(1 + [H+]/Kb + [H+]2/Ka·Kb)): one with a pKa 6.75 ± 0.09 and the other pKb = 4.10 ± 0.13 (Figure 2). The pH dependence of kcat/KM reflects ionizations
in either the free enzyme or the free substrate. Previous studies
with other substrates have detected similar free enzyme pKa values of ∼7 and ∼4.9,25−30

6.75 ± 0.09.

2.3 Calculation
of k3 for the Trypsin-Catalyzed Hydrolysis
of Z-Lys-pnp and Z-Lys-pna
The trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis
of both Z-Lys-pna and Z-Lys-pnp
proceeds via a common acyl intermediate (Z-Lys-trypsin, ES′
in eq 1 and structure
d1 in Scheme 1). Therefore,
both will have the same deacylation rate constant (k3). Using pre-steady-state kinetics, the k2 values for the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pnp
have been determined.25 Steady-state kinetics
have been used to determine kcat values
for Z-Lys-pnp.25kcat = k2k3/(k2 + k3), and this equation can be rearranged to give the equation, k3 = k2kcat/(k2 – kcat), which has been used to calculate the k3 values (line 1 in Figure 3A) for Z-Lys-pna and Z-Lys-pnp from the experimentally
determined values of k2 and kcat for Z-Lys-pnp.25 The experimental
data was fitted to the equation, k3 = k3max/([1 + [H+]/Kb]), assuming k3 was dependent
on a single ionizing group (AH = A– + H+) and the fitted values were k3 = 561
± 104 s–1 and pKa = 6.41 ± 0.22 (Figure 3A, line 1).

0.014. s–1, pKa = 4.23
± 0.19 and pKb = 4.81 ± 0.15.
(B) The ratio k3/k2 was calculated using the fitted values for k2 and k3 determined in (A).
For k3, k3max = 561 s–1, pKa = 6.41.
For k2, k2max = 0.517 s–1, pKa =
4.23, pKb = 4.81.

enzyme and
substrate. ES is the enzyme substrate complex or the Michaelis complex.
THI is the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate, and ES′ is the
acyl enzyme intermediate. P1 (R′NH2)
and P2 (RCOOH) are the first and second products, respectively,
of the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptide RCONHR′.

2.4 Determination of kcat and k2 for the
Trypsin-Catalyzed Hydrolysis
of Z-Lys-pna
In the present work, kcat values have been determined for Z-Lys-pna from pH 3.1–9.8
(Figure 3A, line 2). kcat = k2k3/(k2 + k3), which can be rearranged to give k2 = k3kcat/(k3 – kcat). As k3 is the same for
both Z-Lys-pnp and Z-Lys-pna, we can use the fitted parameters obtained
from the pH dependence of k3 for Z-Lys-pnp
to calculate the value of k2 for Z-Lys-pna
for each value of kcat determined for
Z-Lys-pna from pH 3.1–9.8. Therefore, as k3 and kcat are known for Z-Lys-pna, k2 values could be calculated for Z-Lys-pna.
However, this calculation was not necessary to calculate k2 because k3 was 2–3
orders of magnitude greater than k2 (Figure 3B) and so within
the experimental error (<2%) kcat = k2. Therefore, kcat values for the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna can be
assumed to equal k2 (Figure 3A, line 2). Experimental kcat data (kcat = k2) was fitted to the equation kcat = (kcat)max/(1 + [H+]/Kb + [H+]2/Ka·Kb) assuming kcat was dependent
on the sequential ionization of two ionizing groups (line 2 in Figure 3A). We conclude that k2 has a maximal value of 0.517 ± 0.014
s–1 and is dependent on the sequential ionization
of two ionizing groups (line 2 in Figure 3A) with pKa values
of 4.81 ± 0.15 and the 4.23 ± 0.19 (Table 1).

2.5 Effect of pH on the Ratio k3/k2 for the Trypsin-Catalyzed
Hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna
The fitted values of k2 and k3 (lines 1 and 2 in Figure 3A) were used to calculate
the ratio of k3/k2 from pH 2.6 to 9.8 (Figure 3B). The ratio k3/k2 was dependent on pH having a minimal value
of ∼55 at pH 4.5 but reaching values of 1200 and 1080 at pH
2.6 and 9.8, respectively (Figure 3B). Therefore, for the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis
of Z-Lys-pna, k3 ≫ k2 from pH 2.6 to 9.8 and so k2 is rate limiting for Z-Lys-pna and the expression for KM (KM = Ks·k3/(k2 + k3)) simplifies to KM = Ks from pH 2.6
to 9.8. Therefore, for Z-lys-pna, KM values
are equal to Ks values.

2.6 Determination of Ks and its pH Dependence
Analyzing the KM versus pH data for
dependence on one pKa (equation Ks(obs) = Ksa/(1
+ Ka/[H+])
+ Ksb/(1 + [H+]/Ka)) gives a minimum Ks value
of 0.333 ± 0.025 mM and a maximum Ks value of 23.5 ± 1.9 mM, with a pKa of 5.12 ± 0.17 (Figure 4A). For optimal accuracy when determing KM using the Michaelis–Menten equation, substrate
concentrations should ideally be in the range KM/5 to 5 × KM to optimize
accuracy. However, the maximum concentration of Z-Lys-pna was ∼20
mM and so at low pHs, substrate concentrations were similar to the KM values and therefore accurate KM values could not be determined (Figure 4A). In contrast, the experimental data for kcat/KM (Figure 2) and kcat (k2 in Figure 3) were both in good agreement
with the fitted lines. This is because both kcat and kcat/KM decrease rapidly and do not level off like KM values to a fixed value. Consequently, kcat and kcat/KM values cover a larger range of values than KM values. The log plots of kcat/KM and kcat will reflect two pKa values, pKE1 and pKE2 for kcat/KM and pKES1 and pKES2 for kcat. In contrast, a plot of KM versus pH should give pKa values of 4.2 and 4.8 (Table 1). However, the experimental KM data (Figure 4A)
is not good enough to resolve these two pKa values and determine the pH-independent values of Ks.

Figure 4 Effect of pH on Ks. (A) Ks values are the experimentally determined KM values determined by fitting initial rate
values to
the Michaelis–Menten equation, as described in the Experimental Section. The solid line was calculated
using the equation Ks(obs) = Ksa/(1 + Ka/[H+])
+ Ksb/(1 + [H+]/Ka) and the fitted values of Ksa = 23.5 ± 1.9 mM, Ksb = 0.333 ±
0.025 mM, and pKa = 5.12 ± 0.17.
(B) Ks values (solid circles) were calculated
at 0.1 pH intervals by dividing the fitted values for k2 (Figure 3A) by the fitted values for kcat/KM (Figure 2), kcat/KM = k2/Ks. The solid line was calculated using the equation Ks(obs) = (Ksa·[H+]2 + Ksb·Ka·[H+] + Ksc·Ka·Kb)/([H+]2 + Ka[H+] + Ka·Kb) and the fitted values Ksa = 24.0 mM, Ksb = 32.2 mM, Ksc = 0.373 mM, pKa = 4.23, pKb = 4.82. (C) 1/Ks values (solid circles) were calculated at 0.1 pH intervals
using the values of Ks in (B). The solid
line was calculated using the equation (1/Ks(obs)) = {(1/Ksa)·[H+]2 + (1/Ksb)·Ka·[H+] + (1/Ksc)·Ka·Kb}/([H+]2 + Ka·[H+] + Ka·Kb) and the fitted values Ksa = 24.0 mM, Ksb = 32.4 mM, Ksc = 0.372 mM, pKa = 6.75, pKb = 4.10.

Therefore, to obtain KM (KM = Ks) values consistent
with the fitted values of kcat (solid
line 2 in Figure 2A)
and kcat/KM (solid line in Figure 1), KM values were calculated using these
fitted values and the equation KM = kcat × KM/kcat. The values of Ks (Ks = KM) were calculated at
0.1 pH intervals from pHs 2.6–9.8 (solid circles in Figure 4B).

To determine
the pH-independent Ks values
(Ksa, Ksb,
and Ksc in Scheme 1), Ks values
(Ks = KM)
were fitted (Figure 4B) to the equation for a doubly ionizing system (Ks(obs) = (Ksa·[H+]2 + Ksb·Ka·[H+] + Ksc·Ka·Kb)/([H+]2 + Ka·[H+] + Ka·Kb)) and this gave three pH-independent Ks values of 24 mM (Ksa), 32.2 mM (Ksb), and 0.373 mM (Ksc) (Scheme 1 and Table 1). The fitted values of pKa and
pKb determined from the pH dependence
of Ks had values of 4.23 and 4.82, in
good agreement with the pKa values obtained
from the pH dependence of k2 (Table 1). This is expected
as the pH dependence of Ks (or KM) like kcat reflects
ionizations within the ES complex or THI intermediate (Scheme 1). The pH dependence of 1/Ks like that of kcat/KM reflects ionizations in the free
enzyme. Fitting the 1/Ks values (Figure 4C) to a doubly ionizing
system gave pKa values of 6.75 and 4.1,
which, as expected, were the same as observed for the pH dependence
of kcat/KM (Table 1), which
also reflects ionizations in the free enzyme. The agreement of the
pKa values determined from the pH dependence
of Ks and 1/Ks with the pKa values obtained from the
pH dependence of kcat and kcat/KM, respectively, confirms
that this approach should allow the determination of estimates of
the pH-independent Ks values Ksa, Ksb, and Ksc that are consistent with the experimentally determined
values of kcat and kcat/KM used to calculate the Ks values used. This is supported by the fact
that the pH-independent Ks values Ksa, Ksb, and Ksc obtained from the pH dependence of Ks and 1/Ks were
essentially the same (Table 1).

3 Discussion
The pH
dependence of kcat/KM showed that the active group was A2– in eq 2 and that it
was inctivated by protonation to form AH– and AH2 (eq 2) 2  The free enzyme pKa values
6.75 ± 0.09 and pKb = 4.10
± 0.13 obtained from the pH dependence of kcat/KM and 1/Ks (Table 1) have been attributed to the trypsin residues histidine-57 and aspartate-189,
respectively.9,25−30 In both cases, it is the ionized form of these groups that are catalytically
active (structure a1 in Scheme 1). Histidine-57 is part of the catalytic triad and its ionized
form acts as a general base catalyst during catalysis (b1 in Scheme 1). Once it is protonated
(AH–, eq 2), it can no longer act as a general base catalyst for tetrahedral
intermediate formation (b1 in Scheme 1) and so catalysis is inhibited. However, if the histidine
pKa is raised in the ES complex to a value
>11 (structures b1 and b2 in Scheme 1) so that it can be an effective general base catalyst
for tetrahedral intermediate formation (structures b1 to c1 in Scheme 1), then this pKa will not be observed in our pH studies from
pH 3–10. Protonation of histidine-57 in the free enzyme (structures
a1 to a2 in Scheme 1) is also known to decrease substrate and inhibitor binding and so
this should also contribute to substrate catalysis being inhibited
with a pKa of 6.75.22,31,32

The negatively charged side chain
carboxylate group of the aspartate-189
residue is located at the bottom of the S1 specificity
site where it can form an ion pair with the positively charged side
chains of lysine or arginine substrates. pKa values of 7.1 and 4.55 have been obtained from the pH dependence
of k2/Ks for
the p-nitrophenol substrate Z-Lys-pnp with trypsin.25 With the neutral substrate Z-Ala-pnp, no substrate
interaction with aspartate-189 is expected and so the fact that only
one pKa value of 6.9 was obtained from
the pH dependence of k2/Ks with this neutral substrate25 confirms the assignment of the pKa value
of ∼4 to aspartate-189 in the free trypsin. Likewise, the fact
that pH studies of k2 showed that the
pKa of ∼4 was detected with the
lysine substrate Z-Lys-pnp but not with the neutral substrate Z-Ala-pnp
also confirms the assignment of pKa of
∼4 to aspartate-189 in the trypsin ES complex with Z-Lys-pnp.25 Therefore, the pKa values of 4.1 and 4.23 obtained from the pH dependence of kcat/KM and k2 in the present study with Z-lys pna are assigned
in the same way to apartate-189 in free trypsin and to the trypsin
ES complex or the trypsin tetrahedral intermediate (THI in Scheme 1), respectively (Table 1).

The protonation
of a group with a pKa of 4.1 in the free
enzyme and 4.23 in ES and or the trypsin tetrahedral
intermediate (THI in Scheme 1) decreases the Ks from 32 to
24 mM (Table 1). Therefore,
if this pKa of 4.10–4.2 is due
to ion pair formation between the substrate’s lysine side chain
and aspartate-189, then ion pair formation does not increase substrate
binding but instead leads to a small decrease in binding by increasing Ks from 24 to 32 mM. Small positively charged
guanidines or alkylamines inhibit the hydrolysis of positively charged
substrates by trypsin and they enhance the hydrolysis of neutral substrates
by increasing kcat while KM undergoes minimal perturbation.25,33,34 This led to the suggestion that positively
charged ligands and substrates activate trypsin by binding in the
S1 specificity site.33 Structural
studies have confirmed that positively charged ligands binding to
aspartate-189 in the S1 specificity pocket induce conformational
changes that activate trypsin.35−38 Replacing aspartate-189 with serine resulted in a
a small 2–6-fold change in KM but
a much larger, ∼100 000, decrease in kcat/KM, confirming that the
primary role of lysine and arginine substrates binding to aspartate-189
is to activate trypsin.39 Therefore, these
results show that the binding energy between the carboxylate group
of aspartate-189 and the positively charged side chains of lysine
or arginine substrates is mainly used to activate trypsin and has
a minimal effect on Ks. This explains
why protonation of aspartate-189 (pKa 4.1–4.2)
has such a small effect on Ks (42.4–24.0
mM, Table 1) and yet
such a large effect on k2, resulting in
the stoichiometric inhibition of trypsin (line 2 in Figure 3A).

With the positively
charged Z-Lys-pna substrate, an additional
pKa of 4.81 was obtained from the pH dependence
of the acylation rate constant k2 (eq 1). Protonation of this
group led to an ∼86-fold increase in Ks from 0.37 to 32.4 mM (Table 1). A similar ∼86-fold increase in Ks was observed when histidine-57 was protonated in the
free enzyme with a pKa of 6.75 (Table 1), which would appear
to suggest that the pKa of histidine-57
changes from 6.75 in the free enzyme to 4.82 in the tetrahedral intermediate
adduct (pKTHI1 in Scheme 1) and that the ∼86-fold decrease in KM is due to binding energy being used to lower
the pKa of histidine-57 from 6.75 to 4.82.
It also shows that the protonation state of histidine-57 has a major
role in substrate binding. An ∼3-fold increase in KM below pH 7 was also observed with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-arginine-p-toluidide
and trypsin,40 but in this case, the decrease
in histidine pKa was much smaller (pKa 6.38). Larger 13-fold increases in KM values have also been observed when histidine-57
in chymotrypsin is protonated with hydrazide substrates.41 It has been suggested that these decreases in
binding were due to the positively charged histidine-57 interacting
with the leaving group amine.13 As expected
with trypsin and neutral p-nitrophenol substrates
that do not have a leaving group amine, there is no increase in Ks when histidine-57 is protonated.25 However, with chymotrypsin, decreases in inhibitor
binding at low pH have also been observed with 2-p-toluidinylnaphthaline-6-sulfonate,32 proflavin,31 and peptide-derived glyoxal inhibitors.22 This suggests that a neutral imidazole group
of the histine-57 residue is required for optimal binding of these
substrates and inhibitors.

There is a considerable body of evidence
that shows that the serine
proteases stabilize zwitterionic tetrahedral adducts that mimic the
the catalytic zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate. These zwitterionic
tetrahedral adducts refer to the negatively charged oxyanion of the
tetrahedral intermediate and the positively charged imidazolium ion
of histidine-57 and ignore all other charged groups on the enzyme.
In these zwitterionic tetrahedral adducts, the pKa of the majority of histidine-57 (analogous to pKTHI2 in Scheme 1) is raised16,18,20−22,42 and the pKa (analogous to pKTHI1 in Scheme 1) of the majority
of the oxyanion is lowered.16,18,19,22,43,44 Specific peptide-derived glyoxal inhibitors
are tightly bound as neutral zwitterionic tetrahedral complexes (structure
c1 in Scheme 1), which
are thought to mimic the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate.22,43,45 In these zwitterionic glyoxal
complexes, 1H NMR and 13C NMR have been used
to show that the pKa of histidine-57 is
>11 and the oxyanion pKa is ∼4.22,43 The increase in Ki values at low pH
was dependent on a pKa of ∼4, and
this pKa was assigned to protonation of
the oxyanion in the glyoxal-chymotrypsin tetrahedral adduct.22 Therefore, if the breakdown of the zwitterionic
tetrahedral intermediate in the acylation step of the trypsin-catalyzed
hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna (species c1 in Scheme 1) is rate-limiting, then the pKa of 4.81 (Table 1) in trypsin catalysis should be assigned to protonation of
the oxyanion in the catalytic zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate
(pKTHI1 in Scheme 1). It also shows that tight binding of inhibitors
and substrates is possible when histidine-57 is protonated provided
the oxyanion is also present to neutralize the charge on the imidazolium
ion of histidine-57 (ImH+ O–). If the
oxyanion is protonated (ImH+ OH), the charge on the protonated
imidazolium ion will no longer be neutralized by the oxyanion and
so the positively charged imidazolium ion of histidine-57 will inhibit
binding. Therefore, Ki values will increase
as the oxyanion is protonated, as observed with peptide glyoxal inhibitors
that bind to chymotrypsin as zwitterionic tetrahedral adducts mimicking
the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate.22 This also explains why Ks values with
trypsin increase by essentially the same amount when histidine-57
is protonated (1/Ks in Table 1) in the free enzyme (a1 to
a2 in Scheme 1) and
also in the acylation complex (Ks in Table 1) when the oxyanion
of the zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate is protonated (structures
c1 to c2 in Scheme 1).

It is generally accepted that the nucleophilicity of the
hydroxyl
group of serine-195 is enhanced by the imidazole group of histidine-57
acting as a general base catalyst (structure b1 in Scheme 1). It has been argued that
as the pKa of the serine hydroxyl group
is ∼15,15,16,22,23,42,46 then for general base catalysis by histidine to be
effective (structure b1 in Scheme 1), its pKa should raised
to a similar value of ∼15 on forming the enzyme substrate complex
(ES in Scheme 1)15,16,22,23 and not lowered to a value <7.

Earlier studies on the pH
dependence of chymotrypsin catalysis
appeared to contradict these results as it appeared that the pKa of histidine-57 had been decreased to a value
<7 within the ES complex.10−14 The reassignment of this pKa to the
oxyanion in the present work resolves this contradiction. As protonation
of the oxyanion inhibits catalysis, it is essential that the oxyanion
pKa is reduced to ensure the enzyme is
catalytically active at physiological pH values. This therefore explains
why the serine proteases have evolved to lower the oxyanion pKa so effectively.16,18,19,22,43

When an interaction occurs between two ionizing groups, four
species
would be formed with four microscopic pKa values (c1, c2, c3, c4 in Scheme 1). So, for example, if in Scheme 1 the concentrations of all species (c1, c2,
c3, c4 in Scheme 1)
are equal, then 50% of histidine-57 (pKTHI4 in Scheme 1) and
50% of the oxyanion (pKTHI1 in Scheme 1) will both have
pKa values of 4.8. Likewise, 50% of histidine-57
(pKTHI2 in Scheme 1) and 50% of the oxyanion (pKTHI3 in Scheme 1) will have pKa values of >11.
So this interaction could explain how histidine-57 could have microscopic
pKa values of both ∼4.8 (pKTHI4) and >11 (pKTHI2) in the THI (Scheme 1). Likewise, the oxyanion could have microscopic pKa values of ∼4.8 (pKTHI1) and >11 (pKTHI3) in the THI (Scheme 1). However, the serine
proteases preferentially stabilize zwitterionic terahedral intermediates
(structure c1 in Scheme 1) and so it is expected that at least 99% of the oxyanion and the
imidazolium ion of histidine-57 will have pKa values of ∼4.8 and >11, respectively.

The
deacylation rate constant (k3,
in eq 1) was dependent
on a singly ionizing group (AH = A–) with a pKa = 6.41 ± 0.22, which we assign to histidine-57.
Therefore, we can conclude that the ionization of aspartate-189 does
not appear to have a significant effect on the pH dependence of deacylation.

3.1 Mechanism for the pH Dependence of the Trypsin-Catalyzed
Hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna
The proposed mechanism is summarized
in Scheme 1. In the
free enzyme (a1, a2, and a3 in Scheme 1), the imidazole group of histidine-57 has a pKa of 6.75 and the carboxylate group of aspartate-189
(Scheme 1) that binds
the side chains of the lysine or arginine residues of substrates or
inhibitors has a pKa of 4.1. Binding of
the substrate to form the enzyme–substrate complex (ES in Scheme 1) causes a strong
interaction between the carboxylate group of aspartate-102 of the
catalytic triad and the imidazolium group of histidine-57,16,18,22,47 which perturbs the pKa values of these
groups to values <3 and >11, respectively, so they are no longer
detected in pH studies. This increase in the pKa (pKa > 11) of the imidazolium
group of the histidine-57 enables it to act as an effective general
base catalyst (structure b1 in Scheme 1) for deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic
serine group (pKa ∼ 15), promoting
its reaction with the substrate to form a zwitterionic tetrahedral
intermediate (structure c1 in Scheme 1). The positively charged imidazolium group of histidine-57
helps lower the pKa of the oxyanion stabilizing
the zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate. A small reorientation the
imidazole ring48 will then allow histidine-57
to act as general base catalyst for breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate
(structure c1 in Scheme 1) to form the acyl intermediate (structure d1 in Scheme 1). The rate-limiting step in
acylation (k2) is this breakdown of this
zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate (structures c1 to d1 in Scheme 1). Protonation of
the oxyanion with a pKa value of 4.8 (pKTHI1 in Scheme 1) will decrease the concentration of the catalytic
zwitterionic intermediate (c1 in Scheme 1), inhibiting catalysis, and so k2 decreases with a pKa of
4.8. Protonation of aspartate-189 (pKTHI2 in Scheme 1) with
a pKa of 4.2 disrupts its ion pair interaction
with the ε-amino group of the substrate deactivating trypsin
and promoting substrate disassociation from trypsin. This inhibits
catalysis, and so k2 also decreases with
a pKa of 4.2.

Deacylation (k3 step in Scheme 1) like acylation is also expected to proceed via a
tetrahedral intermediate(not shown in Scheme 1). The imidazole group of histidine-57 has
the potential to act as a general base catalyst for formation of the
zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate and as a general acid catalyst
for its breakdown. As the rate of deacylation (k3) increases with increasing pH with a pKa of 6.4 (Figure 3A), this suggests the imidazole group is acting as a general base
catalyst for tetrahedral intermediate formation. However, as water
has a pKa value of 15.74, an imidazole
group with a pKa of 6.4 would not be expected
to be an effective general base catalyst. Aldehyde inhibitors of chymotrypsin
form zwitterionic tetrahedral adducts with chymotrypsin where the
oxyanion has a pKa ∼ 7 and histidine-57
has a pKa ∼ 8.49 It has been argued that the histidine pKa of ∼8 can be explained by the fact that these
inhibitor adducts of chymotrypsin-like acyl intermediates do not have
a large leaving group that can fix the catalytic histidine in position
and raise its pKa > 11.49 If breakdown of this zwitterionic tetrahedral
intermediate
is rate limiting for deacylation, then another possibility is that
the pKa of 6.4 reflects formation of the
oxyanion of the zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate as proposed
for the acylation reaction. However, as the carboxylate group of the
product of deacylation (P2) is a good leaving group, formation
and not breakdown of the zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate is
expected to be rate limiting in the deacylation reaction. Also, as
there is a very good leaving group in the deacylation step, a concerted
reaction becomes a possibility.17

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Trypsin
(type III, 2×
crystalized, salt free from bovine pancreas) and all other reagents
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Gillingham, Dorset,
U.K. Trypsin was 72% fully active by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl p-guanidobenzoate,50 as described by Malthouse et al.19 Z-Lys-pna was synthesized as described by Mackenzie
et al.51

4.2 Kinetic
Studies
The trypsin -catalyzed
hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna was studied at 25 °C in 3 mL volumes
and 0.1 M ionic strength buffers.52 The
buffers used were pH 3.13–4.38 (sodium formate), pH 4.40–5.49
(sodium acetate), 5.98–7.72 (potassium phosphate), 7.76–8.68
(Tris–HCl), pH 9.05 (sodium borate), and pH 9.76 (sodium carbonate).
pH measurements were made either with a Radiometer combination electrode
(GK 2401C) or by using a Beckman combination electrode model number
39522. Stock solutions of Z-Lys-pna were made up in 1 mM HCl (maximum
solubility ∼18 mM) and quantified using E314 = 13 900 M–1·cm–1, as described by Mackenzie et al.51 Primary
stock solutions of ∼1 mM fully active trypsin were prepared
in 1 mM HCl, and this solution was diluted in 1 M HCl to prepare appropriate
concentrations for the pH studies. A typical assay contained 1 mL
of buffer (I = 0.3 M), 1.9–x mL of 1 mM HCl, and x mL of substrate in 1 mM HCl.
Different substrate concentrations were obtained by adding different
amounts of the stock substrate (x mL). Catalysis
was initiated by adding 0.1 mL trypsin in 1 mM HCl. The concentration
of trypsin was kept constant when determining the catalytic parameters
at a given pH. However, fully active enzyme concentrations were increased
(0.35–83.6 μM) as the pH was decreased to help compensate
for the decrease in kcat and kcat/KM as the pH decreased.
The fully active trypsin concentrations used in the assays were 11–84
μM (pH 3.1–5.0), 3.7–4.4μM (pH 4.4–5.5),
and 0.35–0.39μM (pH 6.0–9.8). Initial rates of
hydrolysis of Z-Lys-pna were followed by determining the amount of p-nitroaniline (E410 = 8800
M–1·cm–1) released over a
5–15 min period. It was ensured that there was always at least
a 15-fold excess of the substrate over enzyme when initial rates were
determined. kcat/KM data at pHs 3.56 and 4.38 were determined from initial rates
obtained when [S0] ≪ KM. The effect of pH on the catalytic parameters was determined by
fitting experimental data to the appropriate function as described
by Cleland.53
