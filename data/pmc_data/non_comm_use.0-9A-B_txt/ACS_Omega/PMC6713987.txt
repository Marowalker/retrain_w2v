The
selective synthesis of mono-N-methyl aromatic
amines was achieved by the reaction of aromatic nitroso compounds
with methylboronic acid promoted by triethylphosphite under transition
metal-free conditions. The target compounds are constructed efficiently
without overmethylation, under environmentally benign reaction conditions
that do not require bases or reductants and therefore are of interest
in pharmaceutical, agricultural, and chemical industries.

==== Body
Introduction
Mono-N-methyl aromatic amines are common scaffolds
among pharmaceutical, dye, and agrochemical compounds.1 Despite the apparent simplicity of the NHMe functionality,
the synthesis of this motif is far from easy.

Most general methods
to prepare these compounds rely on the use
of free amines as starting materials (Scheme 1, strategies A and B). Strategy A is centered
on the construction of the C(sp2)–N bond. The most
frequent approaches make use of methylamine and functionalized aryl
electrophiles under transition-metal catalysis.2 Specific Pd-based3 (Buchwald–Hartwig
amination) and Cu-based4 (Ullmann–Goldberg
reaction) systems have been developed for the coupling reactions of
methylamine with aryl (pseudo)halides, while only some scattered examples
under Ni catalysis have been reported.5

Scheme 1 Previous Strategies and This Work
The Cham–Evans–Lam reaction using arylboronic
acids
has also been used for the construction a few examples of mono-N-methylaniline derivatives.6 Methylamine is a particularly challenging amine to monoarylate by
these procedures due to its tendency to diarylate because of its small
size. Apart from the use of toxic and expensive metals, most of these
transformations require complicated ancillary ligands and/or the presence
of strong bases. In limited cases, transition-metal-free reactions
between methylamine and activated substrates are possible by SNAr or via benzyne intermediates.7 The Umpolung strategy, ie. the use of aryl organometallics together
with nitrogen electrophiles, has scarcely been used for the direct
introduction of an NHMe group.8

Strategy
B (Scheme 1) is based
on the construction of the N–Me bond by making
use of primary arylamines as starting materials. The reactions of
primary arylamines with SN2-methylating agents9 are usually hampered by overmethylation, as a
consequence of the increased nucleophilicity of the monomethylated
secondary aromatic amine in comparison to the nonmethylated starting
material, and the small steric hindrance of the methyl group. Reductive
amination approaches for methylation require the use of formaldehyde
as a carbon source together with a reducing agent.10 Also, the reduction of carbamates11 or formamides12 is feasible. However,
some of these reduction procedures may be incompatible with the presence
of other labile functional groups. To control over-reaction, the use
of acyl13 or sulfonyl14 derivatives of the starting amines as precursors is frequent,
even though this requires the inclusion of protection/deprotection
steps in the reaction sequence, which may be cumbersome. More recent
approaches have been developed to circumvent some of these issues,
such as the use of carbon dioxide15 or
MeOH16 as C1-building blocks. Even so,
these methods require high temperatures and the use of expensive transition
metals and complex ligands. In addition to these procedures, the alkylation
of (hetero)arylamines can also be accomplished by the Cu-catalyzed
Chan–Evans–Lam reaction using alkylboronic acids.17 However, when applied to methylation, the method
requires overstoichiometric quantities of copper salts and methylboronic
acid and a basic medium.18 Dimethylation
is frequent under these reaction conditions.

In many occasions,
the primary arylamines used as starting materials
in strategy B are prepared in advance by the reduction of other nitrogen-containing
functional groups. Therefore the direct engagement of these functionalities
in amine formation has emerged as a relevant strategy (Scheme 1, strategy C) for the synthesis
of secondary arylamines because it eliminates the previous reduction
step, and avoids protection of functional groups that may be labile
to the reduction conditions. In this realm, nitro compounds19 have been used most frequently. Nitroso compounds,20 although less popular, can be used similarly.21,22 Although successful for the synthesis of various alkylarylamines
and diarylamines, this sort of strategy has been elusive for the particular
case of the NHMe group.19 In the present
paper, we have addressed this issue and developed conditions that
permit the transformation of nitrosoarenes into mono-N-methyl arylamines easily.

Results and Discussion
We started
our research by adjusting the reaction conditions for
the reaction of nitrosobenzene 1a with methylboronic
acid 2a towards the direct synthesis of N-methylaniline 3 (Table 1). Based on our previous experience in the synthesis
of diarylamines,21 we tested different
P(III) species as oxygen scavengers.

b Isolated yields.

When using
PPh3 or dppe in toluene, we observed extensive
formation of the azoxybenzene 4 (entries 1, 2).23 On the other hand, the use of P(OEt)3 (1.1 equiv) in toluene significantly increased the ratio of 3 (entry 3). Taking into account the balance between the amount
of methylboronic acid 2, the 3/4 ratio, and the isolated yield in 3 (entries 3 and 4),
the best conditions were found when using 1.1 equiv of P(OEt)3 in toluene (entry 4). The reactions in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
or dichloromethane (DCM) afforded more azoxybenzene 4 and lower yield in 3.

Under optimum reaction
conditions for the synthesis of 3 (Table 1, entry 3),
we carried out the transformation of a variety of nitrosoarenes into
the corresponding N-methyl derivatives (Scheme 2), testing for compatibility
with labile functional groups such as carbonyls or unprotected OH
and NH groups. We observed that nitrosoarenes carrying electron-donating
or electron-withdrawing groups were selectively monomethylated to
form the corresponding N-methylarylamines 5 in good yields. In general, electron-donating substituents, such
as methyl, methoxy, isopropyl, or phenyl (5a–5f) performed well. Sterically demanding ortho-substituted nitrosoarenes
(5c–5f) were also efficiently monomethylated.
This constitutes an important feature, because sterically demanding
substrates are in general less active in N-methylation
processes compared to para- or meta-substituted ones.24 However, double ortho substitution by methyl was not permitted
(5g). Notably, the reaction could also be applied to
substrates bearing reactive functional groups such as cyano, ester,
ketone, as well as aldehyde in ortho-, meta or para-positions (5h–5n). Mono or disubstituted aryl halides were also
well tolerated (5o–5r), thus opening the possibility
of further functionalization of the resulting methylamines by conventional
cross coupling reactions of the aryl halide. Furthermore, N-methylarylamines containing NHAc (5s), unprotected
phenolic OH (5t), and compounds with alcoholic OH groups
(5u, 5v) were synthesized in good yields,
thus avoiding protection/deprotection reactions that are frequent
among other syntheses of N-methylanilines. Finally,
the reaction could be extended to the monomethylation of heterocyclic
nitroso compounds as well (5w, 5x).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Mono-N-Methyl Aromatic Amines 5a–x
In addition to methylation, we were also pleased to find
that this
procedure was also useful for the transformation of the nitroso group
into other mono-N-alkylamines 6 different
from N-methyl (Scheme 3). We tested the reaction of different alkylboronic
acids 2, using nitrosobenzene (1a) as a
reagent. Under optimum reaction conditions for the synthesis of 3, mono-N-alkylaryl amines were obtained
in good yields with primary linear and branched alkyl boronic acids
(6a–6c). However, the reaction with a secondary
alkyl boronic acids gave a lower yield (6c). On the other
hand, the use of cyclic boronic acids such as cyclopropyl (6d), cyclopentyl (6g), cyclohexyl (6h), and
cycloheptyl (6o), permitted the synthesis of mono-N-alkylaryl amines with a good yield. This is an important
issue especially for the sometimes challenging synthesis of N-arylcyclopropylamines (6d).25 For completeness, some additional new cases were included
in the study with differently functionalized nitrosoarenes 1 using cyclopropyl (6e, 6f) and cyclohexylboronic
acids as reagents (6i–6n), including examples
with cyano, ester, ketone, and halogens, among others. All reactions
took place in good yields, including those carrying ortho-substituents.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Mono-N-Alkylanilines 6a–o
In order to test the scaling
possibilities, we have carried out
the 1 g-scale synthesis of the benzothiazole-aniline derivative Pittsburgh
compound B (PiB) 8 (Scheme 4). 11C-PiB is currently the most studied
radio ligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cerebral
amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits by PET for investigational studies
of Alzheimer’s disease. The functionalization of its hydroxyl
group has permitted the synthesis of a variety of other derivatives
with improved pharmacokinetics useful as probes for Aβ by different
imaging techniques.26 Compound 8 was prepared directly from 1 g of hydroxylamine 7 in
a 47% overall yield without purification of intermediates. Thus, hydroxylamine 7 was converted with K3Fe(CN)6 into
the corresponding nitroso compound. Without purification, methyl boronic
acid 2a and P(OEt)3 were added to obtain the
corresponding N-methylarylamine, and the phenolic
methyl group was removed in situ using BBr3.

Scheme 4 Synthesis
of 2-(4-(Methylamino)phenyl)benzo[d]thiazol-6-ol 8
Based on previous
considerations,21 the
reaction can be understood (Scheme 5) by the formation of a key arylmethylaminoboronate
from the nucleophilic attack of P(OEt)3 to the starting
nitrosobenzene followed by borylation of the resulting intermediate
(either the initial tetravalent phosphorous species or a nitrene,
the latter generated by unimolecular extrusion of triethyl phosphate).

Scheme 5 Proposed Reaction Course
Conclusions
In summary, the results presented in this
paper permit the synthesis
of mono-N-methyl aromatic amines (25 examples, 31–82%
yield) and other mono-N-alkyl aromatic amines (15
examples, 50–78% yield) directly from nitroso compounds and
boronic acids without overfunctionalization to secondary amines or
ammonium salts. The reactions promoted by P(OEt)3 are transition-metal-free
and take place in only 20 min at rt, without the need of specially
dried solvents, anhydrous conditions, reducing agents, bases, or other
additives. The subproducts of the reaction, triethyl phosphate and
boric acid, are of low toxicity, thus minimizing the generation of
hazardous substances, as required in contemporary industrial applications.
