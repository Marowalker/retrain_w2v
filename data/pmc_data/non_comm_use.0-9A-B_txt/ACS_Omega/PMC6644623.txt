Silicon
is an attractive anode material for lithium-ion batteries.
However, silicon anodes have the issue of volume change, which causes
pulverization and subsequently rapid capacity fade. Herein, we report
organic binder and conducting diluent-free silicon–carbon 3D
electrodes as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, where we replace the
conventional copper (Cu) foil current collector with highly conductive
carbon fibers (CFs) of 5–10 μm in diameter. We demonstrate
here the petroleum pitch (P-pitch) which adequately coat between the
CFs and Si-nanoparticles (NPs) between 700 and 1000 °C under
argon atmosphere and forms uniform continuous layer of 6–14
nm thick coating along the exterior surfaces of Si-NPs and 3D CFs.
The electrodes fabricate at 1000 °C deliver capacities in excess
of 2000 mA h g–1 at C/10 and about 1000 mA h g–1 at 5 C rate for 250 cycles in half-cell configuration.
Synergistic effect of carbon coating and 3D CF electrode architecture
at 1000 °C improve the efficiency of the Si–C composite
during long cycling. Full cells using Si–carbon composite electrode
and Li1.2Ni0.15Mn0.55Co0.1O2-based cathode show high open-circuit voltage
of >4 V and energy density of >500 W h kg–1. Replacement
of organic binder and copper current collector by high-temperature
binder P-pitch and CFs further enhances energy density per unit area
of the electrode. It is believed that the study will open a new realm
of possibility for the development of Li-ion cell having almost double
the energy density of currently available Li-ion batteries that is
suitable for electric vehicles.

1 Introduction
US
Department of Energy (DOE) and the United States Advanced Battery
Consortium LLC (USABC)’s 2020 roadmap or the next-generation
lithium-ion batteries target electric vehicle pack energy density
of 275 W h kg–1 or 550 W h L–1 at a cost of $125/kW h or below.1 This,
if achieved, would enable a large market penetration of pure electric-driven
vehicles. Besides, the lithium-ion batteries should have improved
safety and cycle life. Therefore, current research emphasis is given
to develop high energy-density cathodes and high voltage electrolytes
coupled with high capacity silicon anodes for increasing the energy
density in Li-ion batteries.2−8 Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion cells use layered transition
metal (TM) oxide cathodes (e.g., LiCoO2, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.15O2, and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2), or phosphates (e.g.,
LiFePO4), Mn-based spinels (LiMn2O4, LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4), and graphitic
carbons as anodes.2 The useable capacity
of most of these cathode systems is in the range between 140 and 180
mA h g–1 when cycled up to 4.2 V, whereas the most
commercially used anode, graphite, is around 350 mA h g–1.2 Thus, there has been an intense research
activity during the last couple of decades to develop high capacity
or high energy cathodes and anodes for lithium-ion batteries. Li–Mn-rich
(LMR)-based compounds, such as Li1.2Mn0.55Ni0.15Co0.1O2, lithium, and manganese-rich
TM oxide (LMR–NMC) composite cathodes, promise almost double
the capacity (372 mA h g–1 for 1.2 Li transfer)
of currently available cathodes that have been investigated as a promising
cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.3−6 To enhance the performance of
anodes which meet the requirement of the automotive industry, researchers
have been investigating materials which form alloys with lithium to
generate anodes that have specific capacities on the order of magnitude
higher than graphite.7,8 Silicon is an attractive anode
material for Li-ion batteries mainly because of its very high theoretical
charge capacity of 4200 mA h g–1 (Li4.4Si) and natural abundance.7−14 However, despite such potential, silicon has a number of fundamental
materials challenges that has impeded its growth toward commercialization.
First, it undergoes tremendous volume changes under lithiation (and
delithiation), which can be as high as 310% for the maximum lithiated
phase of Li3.75Si (at room temperature).7−14 This phenomenon leads to constant formation and reformation at the
interface creating new solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer during
each cycle amounting to loss of lithium inventory to capacity fade.
Further, Si surface has inevitably a native oxide layer and has different
surface reactivity and passivation (with respect to the electrolyte)
that significantly affect the electrochemical reversibility.7−14 These combined challenges make pure silicon anodes almost impractical
for any near-term application unless the fundamental issues are addressed.10−12 There has been an intense research to mitigate volume change during
cycling, such as producing Si-nanoparticles (NPs),7,10,13−15 aligned Si-nanowires/nanotubes,9,16−19 dispersing silicon into an active (such as carbon)/inactive (e.g.,
SiO2) matrix,20−29 silicon-based thin films,30−34 free standing Si–C electrodes, and different morphologies
of silicon.35−41 Taking benefit of high conductivity of carbon and high-capacity
silicon, recent reports demonstrate that carbon–silicon nanocomposites
can circumvent the issues associated with silicon and improve the
overall electrochemical performance of Si-anode for Li-ion batteries.20−34 This is because silicon–carbon nanocomposites can accommodate
a huge strain with reduced pulverization, provide good electronic
contact, and exhibit short diffusion path for lithium-ion insertion.

Another interesting approach of silicon–carbon composite
free-standing electrodes (binder less and current collector less)
which are flexible is used to create thin and flexible lithium-ion
batteries.35−41 Self-standing anodes consisting of molecular precursor-derived silicon
oxycarbide glass particles embedded in a chemically modified reduced
graphene oxide matrix show reversible capacities of ∼702 mA
h g–1 at the 1st cycle and ∼588 mA h g–1 at the 1020th cycle, respectively without any mechanical
failure.35 Composites of Si-NPs and graphene
accommodated on a three-dimensional (3D) network of graphite exhibited
high Li-ion storage capacities of >2200 mA h g–1 after 50 cycles and >1500 mA h g–1 after 200
cycles.36 Freestanding macroporous silicon
film in combination
with pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile composite anode shows a discharge
capacity of 1260 mA h g–1 for 20 cycles.37 Light-weight free-standing carbon nanotube–silicon
films prepared by sputtering method shows a specific charge-storage
capacity (∼2000 mA h g–1) for 50 cycles.38 Binder and additive-free 3D porous nickel-based
current collector coated conformally with layers of silicon delivers
high capacity of 1650 mA h g–1 after 120 cycles
of charge–discharge.39 Overall,
silicon–carbon composite free-standing electrodes prepared
by various synthesis approaches show a capacity between 700 and 2200
mA h g–1 for about 100–500 cycles. Free-standing
electrodes have an overall limited cell capacity because of low loading
of active masses (1–2 mg cm–2, submicron
thickness); expensive techniques are employed for synthesis; and most
importantly, free-standing paper electrodes show high irreversible
capacity loss (∼50%), low cycling efficiency (95–98%),
and poor capacity retention at high current densities and so forth.

Here, we present a unique organic binder-less, additive free 3D
electrode architecture of silicon–carbon NPs on carbon fiber
(CF) current collector which replaces usual copper foil current collector.42,43 Petroleum pitch (P-pitch) is used as a carbon source which makes
a good electrical contact between the CF current collector and Si-active
particles at high temperatures >500 °C. CF mat has numerous
advantages
over copper current collector such as incorporation of large amount
of active material into the 3D CF network and provides high interfacial
contact of active material to the conductive network. Besides, the
CFs are more flexible, having good mechanical strength and can accommodate
the volume change of silicon. However, the silicon NPs will lose the
contact from CF because of the absence of binder. Therefore, there
is need of a material which supports the volume change, improves conductivity,
and binds silicon on to CF. Petroleum pitch which is a complex mixture
of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, derived from heat treatment
of coal and petroleum tars, can be used as a high-temperature binder
to bind Si-NPs on to CF. Pitch undergoes carbonization above 500 °C
to form a conducting carbon through mesophase (liquid crystalline
state).44 Therefore, annealing mixture
of P-pitch and silicon NPs coated on to CF current collector at high
temperatures ≥500 °C melts the P-pitch and allows the
conformal coating throughout the silicon and CF which enables to have
a conductive network and enough space for the volume expansion and
contraction without undergoing pulverization. In addition, the binding
strength of carbonized pitch with silicon and CF is influenced by
temperature. In this work, we have studied the effect of different
annealing temperatures (700, 900, and 1000 °C) on the electrochemical
performance of silicon–carbon 3D electrodes. Electrodes developed
by this method provide enough space for silicon surrounded by carbonized
pitch on CFs which support the volume expansion and contraction during
cycling, thus reducing the pulverization of the silicon. In this type
of electrode, all of the active material is exposed to electrolyte
which implies that the entire silicon is electrochemically active,
whereas in conventional composite electrode in which copper foil is
used as current collector, interior part of the electrode is electrochemically
inactive because of lack of access to electrolyte. Moreover, polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVdF) binder in the composite electrode causes impedance
rise, leading to detrimental in the electrochemical performance. In
addition, copper foil adds extra weight to the electrode. However,
3D Si–C free-standing CF electrodes do not contain any organic
binder and less weight. Besides, carbonized pitch delivers capacity
of about 10% to the total capacity of the electrode. This would further
enhance energy density. The electrode fabrication process is similar
to a solid-state method, which is inexpensive and scalable.

2 Results
The diffraction patterns of Si-NPs are shown
in Figure 1. The diffraction
planes (111),
(220), and (311) at Bragg positions of 28.66°, 47.57°, and
56.39° correspond to pure silicon (face-centered cubic lattice,
space group: Fd3m, JCPDS no. 895012).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Si–C composite electrodes fabricated
at different temperatures shows the corresponding peaks of carbon
and silicon suggesting the successful blend of Si–C composite.
The weak and broad peak between 20° and 30° of (002) plane
indicates the formation of amorphous carbon. As annealing temperature
increases, there is an increase in the intensity of carbon peak, which
indicates the increase in crystallinity. The d-spacing
values of broad peak in Si–C composite formed by annealing
at 700, 900, and 1000 °C are 3.65, 3.57, and 3.52 Å, respectively.
The decrease in d-spacing value with increase in
temperature clearly indicates the increase of ordering of carbon.45

3D Si–C
free-standing composite electrodes annealed at (b) 700, (c) 900, and
(d) 1000 °C.

Si-NPs synthesized by
magnesiothermic reduction are of typical
spherical morphology having particle sizes in the range of 50–100
nm (Figure 2a). Three-dimensional
Si–C composite free-standing electrodes fabricated at temperatures
of 700, 900, and 1000 °C are shown in Figure 2b,c. At high temperatures >700 °C,
P-pitch
coats on to the fiber and Si-NPs and makes a good electronic contact
along and between the fibers and on to the particle. Typically, pitch
forms about 6–14 nm of C coating onto Si-NPs when annealed
at the temperatures between 700 and 1000 °C (discussed later
in Figure 3). The 3D
electrode architecture of Si-NPs on CF electrode shows a uniform distribution
of silicon and carbon throughout the CF. The high-resolution image
(Figure 2c) indicates
the good binding of Si–C composite on CF with enough space
for free expansion and contraction of silicon during alloying and
dealloying with lithium. Si–C composite annealed between 700
and 1000 °C (Figure 2d,e) shows a partial increase in particle size of Si-NPs because
of the coalescence or nucleation of particles leading to agglomeration
compared to pristine silicon (Figure 2a).

indicating carbon coating, lattice fringes, and atomic layers (scale
bar: 5 nm).

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of
Si–C composites were found to be 105, 46, and 15.8 m2 g–1 annealed at 700, 900, and 1000 °C. As
expected, SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
pure Si-NPs converge. Si-NPs have 50–100 nm in size (Figure 3a). Si–C composite
electrodes annealed between 700 and 1000 °C show Si-NP particles
covered by a thick carbon film about 14 nm. The crystallites have
a typical, well-defined face-centered cubic symmetry, and the atomic
layers are also clearly observed. The d-spacing values
of about 0.315 nm correspond to 111 reflections in the XRD pattern
of Si. Si–C composite electrodes annealed between 900 and 1000
°C show about 8 and 6 nm of thick carbon coatings, respectively,
onto Si-NPs. The thickness of carbon coating decreases with increase
of temperature. At a high temperature of 1000 °C, the carbon
coating becomes more compact because of which carbon layer binds strongly
to silicon NPs and carbon fibers because of which the thickness of
carbon coating decreases. This implies that with increasing temperature,
the carbon coatings sinter, allowing to gain more mechanical strength.
This increase in mechanical strength helps in increasing the physical
binding of carbon, silicon, and CFs. The carbon coatings are stronger
and compact on increasing the temperature, allowing the silicon volume
change during cycling without undergoing pulverization.

Raman
spectra (Figure 4)
of silicon–carbon composite fabricated at different
temperatures correspond to Si–Si stretching (peak at 512 cm–1), and D-band (disorder band) and G-band (graphitic
band) at 1355 and 1597 cm–1, respectively. The presence
of silicon and carbon peaks indicates the successful formation of
Si–C composite. The integral intensity ratio of D to G bands
for the Si–C composite samples annealed at 700–1000
°C was estimated to be 1.4 and 0.785, which indicates the formation
of disordered carbons. The decrease of D/G ratio with an increase
of temperature in Figure 4 suggests the increase in graphitic nature with increase of
temperature. This, in turn, increases the conductivity of the electrode
material.

at different temperatures 700, 900, and 1000 °C for 5 h under
argon atmosphere.

Reversible capacity and
cycle stability of silicon anodes significantly
reduce upon cycling at deep cutoff potentials. Cycling silicon anodes
above 50 mV reduce the formation of crystalline phases and result
in good electrochemical performance.46,47 Thus, galvanostatic
charge–discharge cycling of our Si-NPs was carried out in the
potential range between 1.2 and 0.05 V. The 3D Si–C composite
electrodes annealed at different temperatures show higher reversible
capacity (Figure 5a)
compared to conventional silicon composite electrode which suggest
3D electrode architecture and enables the complete utilization of
active material coated onto the CF compared to conventional silicon
electrode. The conventional silicon composite electrodes show a high
irreversible capacity of 48% with an initial lithiation capacity of
3201 mA h g–1. High irreversible capacity is attributed
to the high intake of Li during the formation of SEI in the conventional
Si composite electrode. The low conductivity of the composite electrode
and pulverization lead to rapid capacity fade of Si-NPs in conventional
composite electrode.

Figure 5 (a) Comparison of cycle life of 3D Si–C composite
electrodes
prepared at 700, 900, 1000 °C, and conventional electrode (as
indicated), (b) voltage profiles during lithiation process for the
freestanding electrode annealed at 700 and 1000 °C, (c) C-rate
performance for the Si–C composite free-standing electrode
annealed at 1000 °C, and (d) capacity vs cycle number for the
pitch-coated CFs (no Si-NPs) annealed at 700, 900, and 1000 °C
(as indicated).

The initial lithiation
capacity of 3D Si–C free-standing
composite electrodes annealed at 1000, 900, and 700 °C were 2193,
2712, and 3533 mA h g–1 and that for conventional
electrode was 3201 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C rate, and the
corresponding irreversible capacities were 11, 16, 18, and 48% during
1st cycle. The improvement in irreversible capacity of 3D Si–C
free-standing composite electrodes during first cycle is due to the
coating of carbon onto silicon NPs which reduces the side reactions
of silicon with electrolyte; this in turn reduces with an increase
in the annealing temperature (Figure 5b). Si–C composite annealed at 700 °C shows
an initial high discharge capacity than that of the Si–C composite
electrodes annealed at 900 and 1000 °C; this is due to the high
surface area of Si–C composite annealed at 700 °C than
that at 900 and 1000 °C. In discharge voltage profile, there
is a plateau below 1 V (Figure 4b and Supporting Information Figure
S3) which is due to the alloying of Li+ with silicon and
the plateau from 0.25 to 0.5 V during charging (Supporting Information Figure S3) and dealloying of Li+ with silicon. All of the 3D Si–C free-standing electrodes
annealed between 700 and 1000 °C show similar voltage profiles
(Figure 5b and Supporting Information Figure S3). The 3D Si–C
free-standing composite electrode shows an enhanced electrochemical
performance than that of the conventional silicon electrode. In this
architecture, coating of carbonized pitch onto silicon NPs efficiently
prevents the direct exposure of Si-NPs to electrolyte which helps
in maintaining the interfacial and structural stability. In addition
to this, the 3D CF and carbonized pitch effectively accommodate the
volume expansion and contraction, thus enabling the electrical and
structural integrity of the electrode. Figure 5a shows that the 3D Si–C electrodes
at 700 °C show a high initial stable discharge capacity (∼2600
mA h g–1) than that at 900 °C (2220 mA h g–1) and 1000 °C (2060 mA h g–1) which is due to the high surface area (105 m2 g–1) of Si–C composite. However, the Si–C
composite annealed at 700 °C shows a rapid capacity fade with
a progress of cycling (after 25 cycles), whereas Si–C composite
electrodes annealed at 900 and 1000 °C show enhanced electrochemical
performance in terms of capacity retention and cyclability (Figure 5a). The 3D Si–C
composite electrodes annealed at 1000 °C show very stable capacity
of about 2000 mA h g–1 for over 130 cycles with
little loss in capacity (∼5%), whereas about 25% capacity loss
was observed for the electrodes annealed at 900 °C. High capacity
retention is because of the high conductivity of 3D Si–C composite
electrodes annealed at 1000 °C compared to 900 °C. The C-rate
performance of Si–C free-standing electrodes annealed at 1000
°C shows ∼1000 mA h g–1 capacity at
5 C rate which could be achieved, and these cells cycle very well
for over 250 cycles with little loss in capacity. We have further
evaluated the capacity contribution from the carbon derived from pitch
and CFs used in this study. The pitch-coated carbons on CF annealed
at 900 and 1000 °C show very stable capacities between 250 and
280 mA h g–1 (Figure 5d). The pitch-coated carbons on CF annealed at 700
°C with a high initial capacity of >300 mA h g–1, and the capacity reduces to 225 mA h g–1 in 60
cycles.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) behavior
of Si–carbon
composite 3D electrode architectures annealed between 700 and 1000
°C before and after cycling have been investigated to further
understand the kinetics of electrochemical processes which influence
the electrochemical performance. The impedance spectra of Si–C
composite 3D electrodes were measured in equilibrium conditions using
lithium reference electrode, as shown in Figure 6. The impedance of 3D Si–C composite
electrode annealed at 1000 °C has a low Ohmic (2.07 Ω cm2) and charge-transfer resistance (151.45 Ω cm2) before cycling and that of the electrode fabricated at 700 °C
shows 10.14 Ω cm2 and 183.46 Ω cm2 (Figure 6a). The
electrode fabricated at 900 °C shows intermediate resistances
(6.50 and 156.67 Ω cm2) (Figure 6a). The Ohmic resistance of the electrode
fabricated at 900 °C increases to 17.14 Ω cm2 and a charge-transfer resistance increases to 158.57 Ω cm2 after 100 cycles, whereas the electrode fabricated at 700
°C shows high an Ohmic resistance of 39.96 Ω cm2 and a charge-transfer resistance of 366.18 Ω cm2 after 60 cycles (Figure 6b). The impedance analysis shows the contribution of both
surface resistance and solid-state diffusion through the bulk of the
Si-NPs. The surface process is dominated by an SEI layer consisting
of an inner, inorganic insoluble part and several organic compounds
at the outer interface. The surface resistivity, which seems to be
correlated with the coulombic efficiency of the electrode, grows at
very high lithium contents because of an increase in the inorganic
SEI thickness. EIS illustrates that on increasing the annealing temperature,
there is an improvement in conductivity which in turn helps in improving
the electrochemical performance.

CF electrodes annealed
at 700–1000 °C (as indicated) in the frequency range between
1 MHz and 10 mHz during (a) before cycling at OCV and (b) after 60
cycles delithiation for 700 °C and after 100 cycles for 900 and
1000 °C.

Postmortem analyses of
active materials after 60 cycles for Si-NPs
annealed at 700 °C and after 100 cycles for Si-NPs annealed at
900 and 1000 °C are shown in Supporting Information Figure S4a–c; respectively. From SEM images of Figure S4a, it is observed that the electrode
annealed at 700 °C shows the cracks and complete degradation
of the material leading to the failure of electrochemical performance,
whereas the electrode annealed at 900 °C presented in Figure S4b shows a dispersed carbon-coated silicon
NPs and less cracks and less degradation compared to 3D-Si−C
annealed at 700 °C. Si–C electrodes annealed at 1000 °C
(Figure S4c) show particles similar to
pristine particles, as shown in Figure 2f with very less change in morphology even after cycling
compared to other temperature 3D electrodes. From the above observation,
it is clear that the mechanical strength of Si-NPs increases with
increase of temperature and maintains the integrity of the particles
during cycling which attributes to the improved electrochemical performance.

To characterize the performance of Si–carbon composite 3D
electrode as an anode, the electrochemical performance of Si–C-composite
anode and Mg–F-doped LMR–NMC (Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.55Co0.1Mg0.02O2–xFx)
composite cathodes was tested in a full-cell configuration.48 The Mg–F-doped LMR–NMC cathodes
deliver as high as 300 mA h g–1 capacity (Supporting Information Figure S5) and cycles
very well.48 Coin cells fabricated using
Si–carbon composite 3D electrode and Mg–F-doped LMR–NMC
cathode shows a high open-circuit voltage of >4 V (Figure 7) and a high energy density
of >500 W h kg–1 (calculated from the integration
of discharge capacity) in the voltage range between 4.6 and 2.0 V,
as shown in Figure 7. The irreversible capacity for these cells was less than 10%. These
coin cells show stable cycling for 50 cycles with little loss in capacity.
Further improvements in electrochemical performance in full cells
in pouch-type configuration are underway.

3 Discussions
The
3D electrode architecture of Si-NPs on CF allows the continuous
conducting framework having excellent electronic properties, adaptable
and flexible medium (carbon formed from the pitch and CF) which accommodates
the volume change of silicon during lithiation and delithiation. Further,
increasing the temperature from 700 to 1000 °C increases the
structural ordering of carbon and silicon, which allows coating of
carbon layers throughout Si-NPs. The carbon coating increases the
contact strength of carbon with silicon and CF, thereby increasing
the mechanical strength of 3D-Si–C composite electrode. The
integrity of the Si–C composite material is well-maintained
largely because of the mechanical strength of the CF and pitch. When
the electrodes are fabricated with CFs coated with pitch and Si-NPs,
the pitch improves the connectivity between fiber–fiber and
fiber–Si active material contacts, thereby reducing the total
internal impedance of the cell. During lithiation and delithiation,
carbon strongly holds silicon and allows expansion and contraction
without undergoing pulverization. In addition, the improvement in
conductivity with an increase of temperature also enhances the electrochemical
performance. The 3D electrode CF architecture with pitch controls
the degradation of the Si anode. All of these features offer ample
opportunities for modifying toward better Si-anode materials for an
optimal cell performance.

4 Conclusions
Organic
binder and conducting diluent-free 3D silicon–carbon
free-standing electrodes prepared at 1000 °C shows excellent
electrochemical performance. Reversible capacities over 2000 mA h
g–1 at C/10 rate and ∼1000 mA h g–1 at 5 C rate could be obtained for these electrodes for 250 charge–discharge
cycles. Pitch provides a very thin layer of coating between 6 and
14 nm (annealed at temperature between 700 and 1000 °C) onto
Si-NPs and improves the connectivity between fiber–fiber and
fiber–Si active-material contacts, thereby reducing the total
internal impedance of the cell. During insertion and extraction of
Li, carbon strongly holds Si NPs and allows the expansion and contraction
without undergoing pulverization. The 3D CF electrode architecture
with pitch controls the degradation of Si anode and improves the overall
electrochemical performance during cycling. Besides, usual copper
foil current collector is replaced by CFs which in fact contributes
about 10% capacity of Si–C composite electrodes. Besides, carbonized
pitch delivers a capacity (260–280 mA h g–1) to the total capacity of the electrode. The Si–C composite
electrodes do not contain any organic binder such as PVdF, which does
not contribute to the capacity. All of these factors contribute toward
improved energy density of Si–C composite electrodes. Unlike
other expensive methods used for the fabrication of free-standing
electrodes, the electrode fabrication process presented here is inexpensive
and scalable. Full cells fabricated using Si–carbon composite
electrode and Mg–F-doped LMR–NMC cathode shows a high
open-circuit voltage of >4 V and a high energy density of >500
W h
kg–1 in the voltage range between 4.6 and 2.0 V.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Synthesis and Structural
and Morphological
Characterizations
Silicon NPs are synthesized by magnesiothermic
reduction of fumed silica.15,47 In brief, 1:2 mol ratio
of fumed silica and magnesium powder are mixed thoroughly in a mortar
pestle for 1 h, followed by annealing at 700 °C under argon gas
for 2 h. The obtained product was treated with 1 N HCl solution to
eliminate MgO and Mg2Si-producing pure Si-NPs. Powder XRD
patterns of Si-NPs, CFs, and so forth were performed by using a PANalytical
X’Pert Pro diffractometer (The Netherlands) [reflection θ–θ
geometry, Cu Kα (1.54 Å) radiation]. The diffraction data
were collected at 0.02 step widths over a 2θ range from 20 to
60°. The surface morphologies of the composite powders were measured
by a scanning electron microscope (Carle Zeiss SUPRA 40, field emission
scanning electron microscope) coupled with Thermo NORAN EDS system
for surface element analysis, TEM (JEOL-JSM-700F), and the physical
properties by Raman spectroscopy using a micro-Raman spectrometer
HR800 (Jobin Yovn Horiba, France), with He–Ne laser (excitation
line 632.8 nm) and a microscope objective (50×, Olympus Mplan,
0.4 mm working, numerical aperture 0.75 in backscattering configuration).
The surface area of the Si–C composites annealed at 700, 900,
and 1000 °C are measured by BET experiment (Quantachrome instruments,
USA). Mg- and F-doped (0.02 mol % of Mg and 1:50 wt %—LiF:LMR–NMC)
LMR–NMC material was synthesized, as described in our earlier
report.48

Mg- and F-doped LMR–NMC
composite cathodes are chosen as they deliver stable energy over cycles
compared to pristine LMR–NMC.48 LMR–NMC
composite cathodes have significant energy loss during cycling.6,48

5.2 3D Electrode Fabrication
CF mats
having diameter in the range between 5 and 10 μm (Supporting Information Figure S1a) are obtained
from advanced fiber nonwovens (Hollingsworth & Vose Company, MA,
USA) and are mostly nongraphitic in nature (only disordered carbons)
(Supporting Information Figure S1b). Graphitic
CFs are not used as they are very brittle. The current CFs have a
good mechanical strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity
on the order of 104 S cm–1. A 1:1 wt
ratio of Si-NPs and P-pitch isthoroughly mixed with the required amount
of N-vinyl pyrrolidone to make slurry followed by
coating on CF mats. The coated mats are dried at 90 °C under
vacuum overnight followed by punching, calendaring, and carbonizing
the electrodes at 700–900–1000 °C for 5 h under
argon atmosphere (hereafter, the electrodes are called Si–C
composite electrodes on 3D CF). At a temperature of ≥700 °C,
P-pitch forms a foamlike structure (Supporting Information Figure S1c) and coats on to Si-NPs and along CFs.
Thereby, P-pitch makes a good electronic contact between Si-NPs and
CFs. The electrode structure of 700 °C annealed sample is shown
in Supporting Information Figure S1d. The
complete scheme of electrode fabrication is presented in Supporting Information Figure S2. The loading
of Si–C composite on CF was between 6 and 10 mg cm–2, which is much higher than the reported value.35

5.3 Electrochemical Performance
Studies
The electrochemical performance of the samples comprising
pristine
silicon NPs, on copper foil (conventional electrode) and only pitch-coated
CF, and finally silicon–carbon composite on CF as active masses
were measured by using Solartron cell test system consisting 1470E
multichannel potentiostats and multiple 1455A series frequency response
analyzers (driven by Corrware and ZPlot software from Scribner Associates)
and Arbin battery cycler (Arbin BT2000—battery test equipment,
USA). The impedance measurements were carried out in a frequency range
between 1 MHz and 10 mHz before cycling on an open-circuit condition
(OCV) and in full charged condition after 100 cycles. The conventional
electrodes were prepared by making the composite of 60% active material,
10% PVdF (Kynar), and 30% carbon black (Super C65, Timcal; Nanoshell,
USA) in N-methyl pyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich) coated
on to the copper foil (>99.9%, Strem chemicals, Inc., USA) current
collector by using the doctor blade technique. All of the composite
electrodes were dried under vacuum at 90 °C, followed by punching
them into 1 cm2 area circular discs. The cells were fabricated
in a glovebox (M-Braun, Germany) filled with ultrahigh purity argon
(99.999%). The moisture and oxygen content of the glovebox was less
than 0.1 ppm. CR2032 coin-type cells (MTI, China) were assembled using
lithium foil as a counter electrode, polyethylene–polypropylene
trilayer (Celgard Inc.) as a separator, and conventional silicon electrode
or silicon–carbon composite on CF or only CF as working electrodes,
and 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 ratio of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl
carbonate as the electrolyte. Charge–discharge cycling was
carried out in the potential range between 1.2 V and 50 mV using constant
current. Full cells are assembled with Mg–F-doped LMR–NMC
composite cathodes and current silicon anodes (developed at IIT Hyderabad)
and cycled in the potential range between 2.0 and 4.65 V.48 All electrochemical tests are a conducted set
of at least four cells at each temperatures and are reproducible.
