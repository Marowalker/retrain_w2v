Structures
of different solvates and solute–solvent interactions
of 4-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)urido)benzoate (L1) and methyl-4-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)thiourido)benzoate (L2) with different solvents are analyzed.
The solution of L1 with tetrabutylammonium
acetate (TBAA) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is colorless, but a similar
solution of L2 with TBAA is orange.
On the other hand, respective solutions of these urea and thiourea
derivatives with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in DMSO are orange.
Urea derivative L1 facilitates
the reaction of TBAF with glass to form tetrabutylammonium hexafluorosilicate,
which on further interaction with L1 forms cocrystal 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6. Reorganization of hydrogen-bonded self-assembly
of 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 in DMSO caused by water is established by a dynamic
light scattering study. With an increase in the amount of water in
the solution, visual color changes from orange to colorless, and the
color changes are reversed upon the addition of a dehydrating agent
such as molecular sieves. Solvates of L1 with DMSO, dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylacetamide
are quasi-isostructural. The respective self-assembly of these solvates
differs due to orientations of aromatic rings and the carbomethoxy
group across the thioamide/amide bond. Significant differences in
self-assemblies of the respective DMSO solvate of L1 and L2 are
observed; self-assembly of the former has dimeric subassemblies as
repeat units, whereas the latter has monomeric subassemblies. DMF
solvates of L1 and dimethylacetamide
of L1 are built by dimeric subassemblies
to form self-assembled structures, but these subassemblies differ
in the orientation of the carbomethoxy group across the urea units.

Introduction
Urea- and thiourea-based
molecules have a special status to form
anion-guided noncovalent assemblies.1−4 A thiourea derivative noncovalently bound
to anions has higher stability than the corresponding urea derivative
bound to the same anion.5 Ability of an
anion to deprotonate urea and the solvent-guided deprotonation and
conformational changes of a urea derivative are the key factors in
anion recognition.6,7 Certain anion-guiding chemical
reactions of thiourea derivatives such as hydrolysis and bromination
are useful in anion detection.8 With the
aid of a syn or anti conformer of a thiourea derivative, distinction
of acetate and fluoride ions is possible.9 On the other hand, conformations play an important role in self-assemblies
of urea10−12 and thiourea13−15 derivatives. The specific ability
associated with a particular conformation to bind an organic substrate
has impact on organocatalysis.16−18 Lesser numbers of conformers
of symmetric urea and thiourea derivatives in comparison to unsymmetrically
substituted ones ease their structural study. In general, conformational
changes in solution and the solvent-guided stabilization of conformers
are independent issues. The first one is a dynamic process mentioned
in literature, which is highly dependent on continuously available
energy to cause rotation across a bond by crossing a rotational activation
barrier, and such conformational changes can be frozen. However, the
latter aspect is due to solvation or self-assembly for stabilizing
a conformer in the solid state which may not be the stable one present
in solution.19 Such a conformational adjustment
may not necessarily be yielding a thermodynamically stable conformer
but may lead to a kinetically stable one that can be obtained by self-assembly
or solvation.20 It was earlier shown that
depending on the metal ion different conformations of urea can be
stabilized;21 hence, an integrated approach
dealing with the consequent effects of solvents and anions on conformations
is required. Solvents generally play an important role in guiding
stabilization of a particular conformer of a urea derivative.22,23 The present literature is not suggestive enough to provide integrated
details regarding the differences in structures of solvates and their
respective assembly in solution. Furthermore, self-assemblies formed
by anions such as hydroxide acetate and fluoride show color changes
in specific solvents through deprotonation,3,4 which
leaves scope to study their assemblies under different conditions.
Thus, we have taken up an integrated approach to understand the structure
and properties of unsymmetrical urea or thiourea derivatives methyl
4-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)urido)benzoate (L1) and methyl-4-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)thiourido)benzoate (L2); each having identical substituents.
The chosen examples have the urea/thiourea part attached to a nitrophenyl
group and a carbomethoxy-phenyl group at two different sides (Figure 1a). Such compounds
would show syn–syn or syn–anti conformers as illustrated
in Figure 1b. The stabilization
of different conformationally adjusted molecules (Figure 1c) in the solvate may replicate
the solvent–urea/thiourea interactions in solution. In these
examples, the carbomethoxy group has also a provision to adopt different
orientations, with either of such conformations leading to a conformational
polymorph in the solid state. Conformational polymorphs arising from
orientations of the ethyl part of the carboethoxy group are available
in the literature.24,25 It is also interesting to note
that quasi-structural polymorphs in molecular crystals are obtained
through crystallization from different solvents.26 Thus, we have investigated self-assemblies of L1 and L2 in solution and in the solid state and have studied the consequences
of their interactions with solvents and anions.

derivatives. (b) Syn–syn and syn–anti
conformers and (c) different conformers with respect to orientations

Results and Discussion
Interaction of Solvents with L1 and L2
UV spectra
of the compounds L1 and L2 in different solvents show nonoverlapping
spectra, reflecting characteristic shifts in the absorption maxima.
Compounds L1 and L2 dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) show
sharp absorbance at 347 and 331 nm, respectively. These absorptions
are solvent-dependent; compound L1 dissolved in solvents such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, acetone,
and 1,4-dioxane shows absorptions at 334–337 nm range, whereas
the same compound dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) or DMSO shows
absorption at 345–347 nm (Figure 2a). These shifts observed in the UV spectra
recorded for solutions of L2 in
different solvents (Figure 2b) do not follow a trend to relate with solvent polarity.
As a result of the differences in hydrogen bonding of these compounds L1 and L2 with solvents in different ways, the gap between n−π*
differs in each case in different solvents, which contributes to the
positions at which UV-absorption maximum of these compounds would
occur in different solvents.

Figure 2 UV absorption of (a) L1 and
(b) L2 in different solvents
(10–5 M).

1H NMR spectra of L1 and L2 in different deuterated
solvents as shown in Figure 3 clearly show that solvents (a) affect the chemical shifts
of the aromatic protons of the carbomethoxyphenyl ring, (b) have the
exchangeable N–H signals, and (c) have the least effect on
the chemical shifts of protons on the nitrophenyl ring. Depending
on the aprotic solvent, N–H protons appear at different chemical
shift positions, whereas solutions of the compounds in methanol-d4 show complete exchange of N–H protons
with O–H protons of the solvent. Among the deuterated solvents,
1H NMR spectra recorded in acetone-d6 shows
chemical shifts in the 1H NMR of L1 and L2, which
are distinctly different from those signals obtianed in other deuterated
solvents. In this particular case, the e and f protons of L1 are shifted downfield (Figure 3a); in the case of L2, the e proton is shifted downfield and
overlaps with the signal from d protons as depicted in Figure 3b. This is attributed to the
syn–anti conformer (I and II of Figure 1b) stabilized in acetone-d6 over the syn–syn conformer observed in other
solvents. 2D-HOMOCOSY 1H NMR spectra of L2 in DMSO-d6 and acetone-d6 establish the assignments of the chemical
shift positions of the aromatic protons from their respective coupling
schemes (Figure S1 and S2). It may be noted
that the syn–anti conformer of the thiourea derivative forms
an adduct with acetone.27 The gas-phase
density functional theory B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level shows that the
syn–anti conformer of L2 forms a stable adduct with acetone, which has 98.42 kJ mol–1 lower energy as compared to that of the adduct with the syn–syn
conformer of L2 and acetone (Figure S3). The N–H bond present next
to the nitrophenyl group of the more stable form projects away from
carbonyl of acetone, whereas the N–H next to the carbomethoxyphenyl
unit has a suitable projection for the hydrogen bond with acetone.
Thus, one possible reason for a nominal change in the chemical shift
positions of the 1H NMR signals of the nitrophenyl group
in these compounds in acetone is due to the delocalization of electrons
over the nitrophenyl group. Due to such delocalizations, this N–H
group adopts a partial double bond character on the C–N bond.

Figure 3 Solvent-dependent 1H NMR spectra of (a) L1 and (b) L2 in (i) DMSO-d6, (ii) acetone-d6, (iii) acetonitrile-d3, and (iv) methanol-d4.

A possible conversion of a syn–syn to syn–anti
conformer
using the acetone solvent is confirmed by recording the 1H NMR spectra of L2 proportions
of acetone-d6 and DMSO-d6 as a mixture of solvents (Figure 4). Spectramarked as (v) in Figure 4 are less symmetric in the
acetone-d6 solvent as signals from the
protons on the two aromatic rings that are clear A2B2 patterns in other cases are not very clear in this case and
suggest them to be more closer to the AA′BB′ pattern.
In comparison to signals d and f, signals assigned for c and e are
insignificantly affected upon the increase in the ratio of deuterated
acetone in the mixed solvent. As the concentration of acetone-d6 increased, the overlap of the signals from
d and f took place; thus, the signal f moved drastically downfield.
As a result of the change of the conformation, the proton marked as
f gets deshielded.

ratios (v/v)

Variable temperature 1H NMR in the temperature
range
280–292 K (Figure S4) and concentration-dependent 1H NMR (Figure S5) of L2 in acetone-d6 did not show notable changes, except for the slight change observed
in chemical shifts of N–H protons. This suggests that there
is no free rotation for conformational changes but the solvent forms
assemblies with spontaneously formed conformation-adjusted molecules.

Crystallization of L1 and L2 from solution in different solvents
yielded crystals of three solvates of L1 suitable for X-ray analysis; they are L1·DMF, L1·DMA,
and L1·DMSO and one for L2, namely, L2·DMSO. Urea or thiourea derivatives adopt the
syn–syn or syn–anti conformer28−31 across the C=O/C=S
bond. Hence, these examples provide a way to make a systematic structural
study.

An asymmetric unit of each solvate contains one parent
molecule
with a solvent molecule except in L1·DMF, which has a pair of parent molecules and DMF molecules.
Thus, this is an example of multiple numbers of symmetry nonequivalent
molecules in the unit cell. Symmetry nonequivalent molecules in the
asymmetric unit of the solvate of amide-containing compounds are not
an exception.32 In the present examples of solvates, each adopts a syn–syn
orientation across the urea portion of the solvate. This is due to
the locking of the conformer by the solvent molecule in each case
through bifurcated hydrogen bonds. This is also another reason that
none of the solvate has conventional urea tape motifs.33

Generally, self-assemblies of urea derivatives34,35 are relatively straightforward to respective assemblies of substituted
thioureas;the latter are more sensitive to interplay of weak interactions.36 In the crystal structure of L1·DMSO solvate, two urea molecules form a
dimeric subassembly by bridging DMSO solvent molecules. Such dimers
are formed as a consequence of contribution from C–H···O
bonds (Figure 5a).
In such a subassembly, oxygen atoms of urea and nitro functional groups
are the hydrogen bond acceptors. Oxygen atoms of DMSO are engaged
with two NH of thiourea in bifurcated hydrogen bonds, and also the
two oxygen atoms of the nitro group of L1 form a bifurcated hydrogen bond with a C–H bond of
DMSO. These bifurcated hydrogen bonds are responsible for holding
two independent neighboring solvates as illustrated in Figure 5b.

(b) L2·DMSO solvate. (c)
Overlaid diagram of DMSO solvates of L1 and L2 and (d) bifurcated
hydrogen bonds in L1·DMSO
and L2·DMSO.

Noncovalently linked subassemblies within the self-assembly
of
thiourea solvate L2·DMSO
are different from the one present in the assembly of the corresponding
urea solvate L1·DMSO. In
the former case, the oxygen atom of urea and nitro groups is the hydrogen
bond acceptor, but in the latter case, only the oxygen atom of the
nitro group is the hydrogen bond acceptor. Hydrogen bonds between
the DMSO molecule and L1 or L2 that is responsible to hold a particular
form of the conformer of urea/thiourea are shown in Figure 5d. Each has a similar geometry,
but the difference in bond parameters arises from the differences
in the ionic radii of sulfur and oxygen atoms. This causes distinction
between crystal packing of these DMSO solvates (Figure S6). Details of hydrogen bond parameters of the two
DMSO solvates are given in Table 1, and the rest are listed in Table S1. Orientations of the phenyl rings in two solvates are shown
in the overlaid diagram Figure 5c, and the corresponding torsion angles are listed in Table S2.

DMSO solvates, L1·DMSO
and L2·DMSO, show S=O
IR-stretching at 1017 and 1026 cm–1, respectively
(Figure S7). IR stretching at 1725 and
1708 cm–1 from the solvate L1·DMSO originates from the carbonyl of urea and
ester functional groups. Solvate L2·DMSO has C=O stretching from the ester group at
1710 cm–1. Solvate L2·DMSO has a sharp C=S stretching at 1593 cm–1.

The hydrogen-bonded dimeric subassemblies
within self-assemblies
of L1·DMF and L1·DMA solvates shown in Figure 6a,b have clear differences
in the orientation of the respective carbomethoxy group. Carbonyl
of the carbomethoxy group is involved in bifurcated hydrogen bonds
with two C–H bonds in L1·DMA, whereas there is no such hydrogen bond in the assembly
of L1·DMF solvate. Oxygen
atoms of solvent molecules are hydrogen bond acceptors forming N–H···O
bonds in each case. Packing diagrams of the two solvates differ, which
are shown in Figure S8. The carbonyl group
of the carbomethoxy part of L1·DMA projects in the same direction as that of carbonyl of urea
[(i) of Figure 6c],
whereas in L1·DMF carbonyl
groups project away from each other [(ii) of Figure 6c]. Gas-phase density functional theory B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p)
level calculations show that the two conformers arising from orientations
of the carbomethoxy group of L1 have comparable energy (Figure S9). Thus,
differences in the orientations of the ester group in the two solvates
are due to the consequence of packing requirements. The weak interactions
are analyzed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. Hirshfeld surfaces of
different solvates highlighting different weak interactions present
in each crystal packing are shown in Figure S10. Fingerprint plots (Figure S11) with
O···H interactions and relative contributions of various
interactions expressed as percentages are tabulated in Table S3. Contributions from O···H
interactions in thiourea solvate L2·DMSO are 4.6–5.9% lower as compared to that of
urea solvates. The higher contributions of O···H interactions
in L1·DMSO, L1·DMF, and L1·DMA solvates are obviously due to the movement
of the sulfur atom of thiourea to the oxygen atom of urea derivatives.

Interactions of TBAA and TBAF with L1 and L2
Interactions
of anions with receptors based on urea and thiourea
are well-studied.35 A solution of urea
derivative L1 does not show color
change (Figure 7a)
on the addition of tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA), whereas a solution
of compound L2 in DMSO shows
a yellow-orange color upon interaction with TBAA (Figure 7b). Compound L1 is selective to show the color change with
only tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) among several other tetrabutylammonium
salts (Figure S12a). The inherent basicity
associated with certain anions such as hydroxide or acetate causes
noticeable spectral changes of solution of L1 in a similar wavelength as apparent in their respective
spectra. However, such changes are insignificant to cause visual color
changes or intensities that are comparably low to make a comparison
with the drastic changes observed from interactions with a fluoride
anion. The binding constant of L1 with TBAF is 2.49 × 105 M–1, whereas
those of chloride, bromide, and acetate salts are 0.12 × 105, 0.15 × 105, and 0.55 × 105 M–1, respectively. L2 shows color changes identical with TBAF, TBAA, or hydroxide
but does not show color change with other salts (Figure S12b). In this case, the binding constants are 4.52
× 105 , 0.25 × 105, 0.16 × 105, and 3.98 × 105 M–1 for
tertrabutylammonium fluoride, chloride, bromide, and acetate, respectively.
These clearly establish the selectivity of binding of L1 as fluoride ≫ acetate > chloride
≈ bromide and of L2 as
fluoride ≥ acetate > chloride > bromide. The gradual
addition
of TBAA to L2 shows a red-shifted
absorption at 416 nm which develops through an isobestic point at
378 nm (Figure S12c). Thus, it is possible
to distinguish compounds L1 and L2 independently in DMSO solution
by adding TBAA. Differentiation of urea and thiourea derivatives38,39 by an acetate anion is due to the higher acidic character of thiourea
in DMSO.

Figure 7 Color changes observed by naked eye in solution (i) without and
(ii) with TBAA (in DMSO 10–3 M) of (a) L1 and (b) L2.

1H NMR titration spectra
of L1 and L2 (aromatic
region is shown for clarity) with TBAA in DMSO-d6 are shown in Figure 8. Clear changes in the chemical shift positions of proton
signals appearing in the aromatic region are observed, in addition
to the changes imparted on the exchangeable protons. In the case of L1, a half equivalent of TBAA shifts
the f signal downfield (Figure 8a) and the signals d and e are slightly shifted, which is
due to the hydrogen bonding of L1 with the acetate anion to form adduct A as illustrated
in Figure 8a. Upon
the increase of TBAA concentration to 1 equiv, there are no further
changes in the chemical shifts of aromatic protons. Two N–H
hydrogen atoms become more acidic upon the formation of A′ (Figure 8a) as reflected
in their chemical shifts, and these signals appear at 13.0 and 13.3
ppm. This indicates that there is no deprotonation to generate anionic
species, so the color of this solution is unaffected by TBAA. The
situation with L2 is quite different.
In this case, deprotonation takes place with half equivalent of TBAA
which bridges two thiourea molecules forming B. Upon
formation of anion B, the signals d and f merge as there
is an exchange of protons from N–H with an acetate ion (Figure 8b). Also, on further
addition of TBAA to this solution, a stable 1:1 adduct B′ is generated (Figure 8b). These solution studies suggest that the interactions of the acetate
with urea and thiourea derivatives differ. This is attributed to the
fact that in the case of urea, there is a competition for retaining
tape-like structures by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and urea binding
with acetate anion to form cyclic hydrogen-bonded subassemblies, which
is illustrated as A′ in the right side of Figure 8a. Hence, such a
competition does not allow a higher intake of acetate to the hydrogen-bonded
assembly more than 1 equiv nor deprotonates the urea. By contrast,
in the case of the thiourea derivative, the softer sulfur atoms of
the thiourea derivative allow deprotonation to form B′ as shown in the right side of Figure 8b. Because of such effects, color differences arise
in the two solutions.

Figure 8 Aromatic region of 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) spectra during titration of (a) L1 and (b) L2 with
(i) 0.0, (ii) 0.5, and (iii) 1 equiv TBAA.

Because of the presence of such an anion, the color of the
solution
turns yellow-orange, which is usual due to the interactions of TBAF
with urea and thiourea derivatives;37 for
which L1 and L2 are no exceptions. UV–visible titrations
of L1 as well as that of L2 with fluoride ions show isobestic
points at 370 and 378 nm, respectively (Figure S13). Hence, on interaction of L1 or L2 with TBAF, one
product is formed. Compound L2 shows color change with TBAF, acetate, or hydroxide in an identical
manner but does not show color change with other salts (b of Figure S12). Similar spectral changes of L1 or L2 occur in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide which
is suggestive of deprotonation of urea or thiourea derivatives (Figure S14). The interactions of L1 or L2 with TBAF are tested in different solvents such as acetonitrile,
tetrahydrofuran, acetone, 1,4-dioxane, DMF, and DMSO. The absorption
maxima of L1 or L2 showed greater shifts in the DMSO solvent
compared with other polar aprotic solvents (Figure S17). This result is reflected in the 1H NMR titration
of L1 with TBAF. Shifts in the
positions of signals of aromatic protons close to the urea part are
observed, whereas the protons present at the meta-positions are magnetically
equivalent, which are less affected (Figure S18). This is due to binding of urea N–H of L1 and TBAF in the DMSO solvent.

1H NMR spectra of L2 with half
equivalent of TBAF shifts the signal e of L2, and it overlaps with the signal from d
proton, whereas the signals c and d are not significantly shifted
and signal f is nominally shifted downfield from 7.71 to 7.73 ppm.
These results suggest that half equivalent of TBAF forms an assembly
between the monoanion of L2 and
neutral L2. TBAF initially forms
a dimeric assembly similar to the one with TBAA, but dianion of L2 is formed upon the addition of
more amount of TBAF. For such a dianion, only two aromatic signals
in the aromatic region (Figure 9) are observed. UV–visible spectra of L2 with excess amounts of fluoride shift the
absorption maximum toward a higher side eventually to 450 nm. Dianions
(III) shown in Figure 9 have an amino-quinone backbone with a flanking C=S bond and
are self-assembled by an H2F+ cation. No HF2– anions are isolated during interactions
with TBAF that was reported with related substrates.40 This suggestion is based on the observed overlapping of
two aromatic signals, which is likely to be from a resonance-stabilized
structure suggested in spectra (iii) of Figure 9. 4-Nitrophenyl containing symmetric thiourea
derivatives form dianions by interacting with fluoride ions;6 in the present example, the ester containing
a phenyl ring is similar to the nitrophenyl group as an electron-withdrawing
group that adopts a similar resonance structure.

Cocrystals of thiourea with TBAF are well-known.41 Attempted crystallization to obtain crystalline
adducts
of L1 or L2 with TBAF yielded crystals only in one case; that
is crystals of product of L1 reacting
with TBAF in a glass vessel. In this particular case, the cocrystal
of L1 with tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorosilicate having a composition 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 (1) was obtained. The crystal structure of this cocrystal has four L1 molecules, two SiF62– anions and two TBA counter cations, in an asymmetric
unit. One SiF62– anion is held by N–H···F
and C–H···F hydrogen bonds (Figure 10a). Fluorine atoms of the
SiF62– anion act as a hydrogen bond acceptor.
SiF62– anions are formed by the reaction
of liberated hydrofluoric acid from the reaction of urea with TBAF
and the silica of the glass vessel. Reactions involving fluoride ions
to generate hexafluorosilicate using a neutral receptor in a glass
vial is of interest to dissolve silica to an easily transformable
substrate. Such a condition was observed earlier with a tripodal ligand
which is much complex to be synthesized.42 Alternatively, hexafluorosilicates generated by fluoride on reaction
with the glass vessel are known.43−46

Figure 10 (a) Hydrogen bonds between L1 and SiF62– anion and (b) CPK model
showing the surrounding of the SiF62– anion.

Two L1 molecules and two tetrabutylammonium
cations encapsulate one SiF62– anion
through hydrogen bonds as shown in the space-filling model (Figure 10b). Furthermore,
the neutral cocrystal shows color change upon dissolution, which is
not the case with other cationic receptors containing hexafluorosilicate
salt.43−46 Thus, we clearly show that neutral hydrogen-bonded species has a
role in the activation of urea, leading to deprotonation of urea.

The present cocrystal 1 is interesting: it does not
have an intense color in the solid state and appears as a light yellow
crystal. Once the cocrystal is dissolved in DMSO, it shows absorption
at 481 nm, which is the characteristic absorption maxima of the L1 generated upon interaction with
fluoride or hydroxide. Thus, this cocrystal is an intermediate neutral
complex, which in solution in DMSO forms deprotonated species of the
host to exhibit a color. In fact, the compound L1 provides colorless solution in the presence
of TBAF in 1,4-dioxane, and this particular solvent has established
literature to form a stable solvate with urea derivatives.47

Furthermore, the assemblies formed between L1 and hexafluorosilicate anion in
DMSO solution can
be disassembled by adding water reversibly. In UV–visible spectroscopic
titration of L1 with TBAF, the
changes in absorptions pass through an isobestic point, showing that
only one type of species is formed (Figure S13a). Because we could not isolate the fluoride cocrystal but could
isolate hexafluorosilicate cocrystal 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6, we studied the UV–visible
absorption of 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 in DMSO solution by adding water and removing
the added water by a dehydrating agent.

The presence of water
in the solution shows a decrease in absorption
at 481 nm, a peak characteristic of the deprotonated form of L1 and an increase in absorption at
347 nm which is due to neutral L1. A similar result was found when we recorded the UV–vis absorption
of 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 at different time intervals on moisture absorptions
or addition of water (Figure S20). When
the added water was removed by a molecular sieve, a colorless solution
is formed. Such a process can be repeatedly done as shown in Figure 11. This observation
suggests that the DMSO solvent facilitating the assembly of deprotonated L1 with hexafluorosilicate is opposed
by water to show deprotonation–protonation equilibrium.

Figure 11 Changes in
UV–visible absorption of 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 at 481
nm in the absence and presence of water in DMSO upon alternative addition
of water and a molecular sieve.

To differentiate energies associated with an encapsulated
structure
where (TBA)2SiF62– is held
between two L1 or it would remain
as a discrete cocrystal with composition 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6, optimization
of these compositions was carried out by DFT and was found that inclusion
is favorable (Figure S19). The dynamic
light scattering study has shown that in solution, 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 (Figure S21) remains as an aggregate with an average
size of 218.9 nm. Upon addition of water, such an aggregation changes
to form a new aggregation with an average size of 279.9 nm. Thus,
this shows that water molecules reorganize the self-assembly of the
cocrystal by changing the hydrogen-bond schemes to cause the color
change by influencing the aggregation-induced absorption property.

Conclusions
Stabilizations of syn–syn and syn–anti
forms of L1 and L2 in solution are dependent on solvents.
DMSO prefers the stabilization
of syn–syn geometry, whereas acetone favors the syn–anti
forms of L1 or L2. As a packing requirement, orientations
of carbonyl groups of esters in DMF and DMA solvates of L1 differ in their respective solvate, but
in solution, the study of these solvents could not differentiate such
orientations. The specific ability of acetate to deprotonate thiourea
but not urea provides means for visual distinctions. The intensification
of color upon dissolution of cocrystal of L1 with a hexafluorosilicate anion provides the evidence
about the existing difference between its self-assemblies in solution
and in the solid state and the participation of the solvent in changing
assemblies. This aspect is further reflected in the difference in
the aggregation size in the DLS study of DMSO solution with or without
water. In DMSO solution, equilibrium between anion-assisted deprotonation
of urea or thiourea derivative can be reversibly tuned by adding water
followed by removing water from the solvent. Replica self-assemblies
present in solution are reflected in the solid state in certain solvates,
but the number of issues related to the interplay of weak interactions
makes the necessity to deal each assembly independently. On the basis
of low temperature and concentration-dependent study, it is clear
that the signatures of the orientations of carbomethoxy groups or
the overall conformation stabilized by the solvent in particular solutions
do not necessarily get reflected in solid-state structures of solvates.
The observed differences in orientations in the solid state relate
to the propensity of the crystals to form tightly packed structures.
A similar aspect is reflected in the self-assembly of cocrystal 1 and its changes in dissolution as in solution, the participation
of the solvent and water molecules matters. Such processes resulting
in reversible assembly and disassembly in solution as demonstrated
may be tuned to show properties and reactivity related to aggregation
that may in turn have practical utilities in delivery, detection,
signal transduction, and chemical reactivity.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
and Characterization
To a solution of methyl-4-aminobenzoate
(0.151 g, 1 mmol) in diethylether (30 mL), 4-nitrophenylisocyanate
(0.164 g, 1 mmol) or 4-nitrophenylisothiocyanate (0.180 g, 1 mmol)
was added and stirred at room temperature overnight. A yellow precipitate
was formed; the filtered and dried samples were L1 or L2.
Different solvates of L1 and L2 were obtained by slow evaporation
of the respective solution in the corresponding solvent.

Crystallographic Study
X-ray single-crystal
diffraction
data for L1 and L2, solvates, and cocrystals were collected
at 298 K with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) with
the use of a Bruker Nonius SMART APEX CCD diffractometer equipped
with a graphite monochromator and an APEX CCD camera. For data collection,
indexing, and determination of the unit cell parameters, SMART software
was used. SAINT and XPREP software were used in data reduction and
cell refinement, and finally, structures were solved by the direct
method and full-matrix least-squares on F2 approximation with the aid of SHELXL-14. All nonhydrogen atoms were
refined in anisotropic approximation against F2 of all reflections. Hydrogen atoms were placed at their geometric
positions and either set to be “fixed” or “riding”
and refined with isotropic approximation. Crystallographic data are
tabulated in Table 2.

UV–Visible Experiments
Stock solutions of L1 and L2 (1 × 10–3 M) and different tetrabutylammoinum
salts were independently prepared in DMSO. All UV–vis measurements
were recorded in a 3 mL quartz cell with a 10 mm path length at room
temperature. UV–vis spectroscopic titrations were recorded
by adding different amounts of anion solution to L1 or L2 DMSO
solutions. The effect of water on 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 was studied by recording
the UV–visible spectra of 2.5 mL (1 × 10–5 M) cocrystal 2L1·(TBA)2SiF6 DMSO solution. To this solution, water (1.6
wt %) was added, and UV–visible spectra were recorded. After
recording the UV–visible spectra of such a solution after the
addition of water, the solution was kept with molecular sieve (200
mg, average size 0.5 nm) for 1 h and decanted. The UV–visible
spectrum of the decanted solution was taken again. The process was
repeated three times.
