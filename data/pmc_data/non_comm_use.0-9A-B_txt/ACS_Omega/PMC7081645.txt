New self-assembled
hydrogel materials of poly(vinyl alcohol)/cyclodextrin-modified
poly(acrylic acid)/azobenzene-modified poly(acrylic acid) (PVA/PAA-CD/PAA-Azo)
were successfully prepared via host–guest interactions and
hydrogen bonds. The as-prepared hydrogel materials were characterized
by various techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet
spectroscopy, and specific surface area tests. The prepared hydrogels
with different concentrations of PVA exhibited different network structures.
In addition, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation and temperature change
induce a gel–sol phase transition in the hydrogel materials.
The obtained hydrogel materials could be used as good adsorbents for
two model organic dye molecules, which was mainly due to electrostatic
interactions between methylene blue/rhodamine B (MB/RhB) and the gels
in the adsorption process. In particular, the adsorption processes
of the as-prepared hydrogel materials conformed to the pseudo-first-order
model with a high correlation coefficient, which indicates that gel
has a potential application in the field of wastewater purification.

1 Introduction
Hydrogels have been widely researched in material fields, such
as drug delivery systems,1,2 biosensors,3 tissue engineering,4 and wastewater treatment.5,6 The mechanical properties
and stimulus response of hydrogels play a key role in their application.7,8 By designing unique structures or introducing reversible bonds into
the hydrogel network, the practical application of hydrogels can be
greatly improved.9,10 It is difficult for conventional polymer network
hydrogels to achieve stimulus response because they do not re-form
covalent bonds. One of the most facile methods for preparing supramolecular
hydrogels is the formation
of a noncovalent system using host–guest interactions,11 hydrogen bonding,12 π–π stacking interactions,13 or ion interactions.14 In all
noncovalent interactions, the host–guest interaction has been
widely used to prepare supramolecular materials.15−18

In host–guest systems,
cyclodextrins (CDs) are ideal host
molecules because they have a conical hollow special structure with
a hydrophilic exterior edge and a hydrophobic interior cavity.19 Cyclodextrin is composed of six, seven, or eight
repeated monomers of glucopyranose units linked by α-1,4-glycosidic
linkages, called α-, β-, and γ-CD, respectively.20 β-CD, as one of the most commonly used
derivatives, has attracted much attention due to its easy acquirement,
moderate internal diameter, and good modifiability. In addition, a
well-controlled clathrate can be easily obtained by the modification
of azobenzene to an ideal guest of β-CD. Azobenzene has cis
and trans spatial structures with significant differences in molecular
size and dipole moment. Reversible cis–trans isomerization
of azobenzene is induced based on light irradiation at different wavelengths,
leading to the reversible assembly of clathrates, which may affect
the macroscopic behavior of the material.21,22

Recently, supramolecular gels have received much attention
as highly
efficient and economical adsorbents for adsorbing harmful contaminants.23,24 For example, Thakur and coworkers reported a sodium alginate-based
organic/inorganic superabsorbent composite hydrogel for the adsorption
of methylene blue (MB).25 The porous three-dimensional
(3D) network structure inside the hydrogel provides a large surface
area and a large number of channels, thereby providing abundant channels
and numerous adsorption sites for the dispersion of dye solution.26−29 For example, Pandey et al. reported natural locust bean gum-based
hydrogels as good adsorbents for the removal of dyes from an aqueous
solution.27 Marandi and coworkers reported
a poly(AA-co-VPA) hydrogel as a potent adsorbent
for the adsorption of dye.30 Hu et al.
reported a PAA-based superadsorbent hydrogel for the removal of MB.31 In general, most of the previously reported
dye adsorbent materials exhibit some disadvantages, such as complicated
preparation, toxic raw materials, poor stability, and weak adsorption
capacity.23,32 Therefore, in practical applications, it
is still a challenge to manufacture an adsorbent highly efficient
and capable to rapidly remove dyes, with good mechanical stability
and ecofriendly preparation.

In this study, we designed and
synthesized a novel hydrogel material
using poly(vinyl alcohol), azobenzene-modified poly(acrylic acid),
and cyclodextrin-modified poly(acrylic acid) (PVA/PAA-CD/PAA-Azo).
The formations of hydrogels were mainly driven by host–guest
interactions and hydrogen bonding, as shown in Figure 1a. Moreover, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation
and temperature change induce a gel–sol phase transition in
the hydrogel material. In addition, the obtained hydrogels show excellent
adsorption performance and potential application in removing organic
dyes and wastewater purification.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization
of Hydrogel
Herein, the inset of Figure 1b shows a photo of the hydrogels. It can
be seen that the
four sets of hydrogels show excellent gel stability, and with the
increasing concentration of PVA, the hydrogel becomes more and more stable (Table 1). Figure 1b–e shows the microstructures of the freeze-dried
samples. According to SEM, it can be observed that all xerogels exhibit
a three-dimensional porous network structure. The pore sizes of the
network are in the range of nanometers to several micrometers, and
the interconnected
porous represent areas filled with water. On comparing the xerogels,
it could be seen that the size of pores and the cross-link density
vary with the PVA concentration. Due to the increase in the concentration
of PVA in hydrogels, the cross-link density in the gel increases.
To further explore the microstructures of the gel, Gel-D was analyzed
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SEM combined with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the elements
present in the hydrogel, as shown in Figure 2. The obtained TEM images of the hydrogel
further indicated that porous 3D network nanostructures were formed
by the self-assembly process. It could be seen that the formed gel
was a slit pore material composed by the accumulation of platelike
particles with pores in several nanometer sizes. The corresponding
elemental mapping analyses of Gel-D are shown in Figure 2b–d. EDS elemental maps
reveal that the compositional distributions of the two elements (C,
N) in Gel-D are uniform. It can be seen that the N element mapping
is weak due to the small amount of 4-aminoazobenzene- and NH2-β-CD-modified PAA (0.05 equiv of the acrylic acid unit). The
element mapping images demonstrate that the pore walls consist of
thin layers of PAA-CD, PAA-Azo, and PVA, due to the host–guest
interaction between CD and Azo, which results in hydrogel formation.

electron microscopy (TEM) images of Gel-D; (b)
EDS elemental maps of Gel-D (b–d).

and PAA-Azo in Hydrogels
 	PAA-CD concn [mg/mL]/volume [mL]	PAA-Azo concn [mg/mL]/volume [mL]	PVA concn [mg/mL]/volume [mL]	
Gel-A	20/0.5	20/0.5	12.5/1	
Gel-B	20/0.5	20/0.5	25/1	
Gel-C	20/0.5	20/0.5	37.5/1	
Gel-D	20/0.5	20/0.5	50/1	
To characterize
structural changes in the gels, Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of PAA-CD, PAA-Azo, PVA, and four sets of
hydrogels (Gel-A, Gel-B, Gel-C, and Gel-D) were further collected,
as shown in Figure 3a. For PVA, the absorption band at 3431 cm–1 is
ascribed to the hydroxyl group (O–H) stretching vibration.
For the PAA-CD, the characteristic peaks at 1730 cm–1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group.
Moreover, for the hydrogel, the absorption band at 1730 cm–1 assigned to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group in PAA
shifts to around 1722 cm–1 in the gel, suggesting
the formation of relatively weaker C=O---H–O hydrogen
bonds between PVA and PAA chains.12 The
peak at 1038 cm–1 was ascribed to the vibration
of the C–O–C bond. Furthermore, the peak at 1095 cm–1 was attributed to C–OH bonds. The absorption
peak at 2920 cm–1 represents the antisymmetric absorption
of the −CH2 group.

and hydrogels; (b) X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns PVA, PAA-CD, PAA-Azo, and hydrogels.

Next, the obtained PAA-CD, PAA-Azo, PVA, and four
sets of hydrogels
(Gel-A, Gel-B, Gel-C, and Gel-D) were characterized by the XRD pattern
in the 2θ range of 0–60, and the results are shown in Figure 3b. The XRD pattern
of PAA-CD and PAA-Azo has a broad peak with a position of 19 and 21°,
respectively, which is mainly attributed to the alkyl main chain in
the PAA molecule; PAA-CD and PAA-Azo were in an amorphous state. In
the XRD pattern of PVA, a sharp crystalline peak at a 2θ value
of 19.31 and a shoulder peak at a 2θ value of 22.61 correspond
to the (101) and (200) planes of PVA crystallites.33 All hydrogels show sharp diffraction peaks at a 2θ
value of 19.31, and the crystallinity of the hydrogel gradually increases
with the increase of the PVA concentration, suggesting that the introduction
of PVA chains into gels can increase the crystallinity of the gels.

Furthermore, the porous microstructure of the obtained xerogels
was further investigated by utilizing the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms, as shown in Figure 4a. The experimental data of the samples are shown in Table 2. The adsorption isotherms
of xerogels are S-type, which means that the adsorption process occurs
on macroporous solids. Within the pressure range tested, the hysteresis
loops of xerogels are type IV isotherm curves observed at a higher relative pressure (P/P0 = 0.80–0.95), indicating
the presence of a macroporous structure. These two hysteresis loops
can be divided into H3 or H4 hysteresis effect, indicating that the
formed gel adsorbent is a slit pore material formed by the accumulation
of platelike particles. In addition, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method was also used to calculate the pore size distribution
of the gel and the results can be seen in Figure 4b. Gel-D has a higher BET specific surface
area of 29.96 m2/g, while Gel-A has an area of 27.77 m2/g. The order of the pore volume and average pore diameter
was Gel-A > Gel-D, which indicated that as the amount of PVA increased,
the cross-linking density of the hydrogel became larger.

size distribution of the obtained hydrogels.

It is well known that
azobenzene compounds exhibit typical trans–cis
isomerization under ultraviolet irradiation and show unfavorable cis–trans
isomerization under visible light.32,34 β-CD
and its derivatives can only form inclusion complexes with trans Azo
molecules, which are mainly governed by hydrophobic interactions.
The photoisomerization performances of the azobenzene group were studied
using Gel-D, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5c shows the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption
spectra of Gel-D with the irradiation time of 0 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 1 min, and 5 min. The major absorption
peak at 348 nm was assigned to the π–π electronic
transition of the azobenzene trans-isomer, whereas that at 438 nm
was assigned to the electronic transition of the cis-isomer. With
the increment of ultraviolet irradiation time, the π–π
transition peak intensity gradually decreases and the n−π
transition peak intensity gradually increases, which confirms the
trans-to-cis isomerization of the azobenzene group. Therefore, supramolecular
hydrogels undergo gel–sol transitions under UV light (λ
= 365 nm). When excluded from the CD cavity, the cross-linked inclusion
complex dissociated within a certain time. After leaving the sol state
in visible light (λ = 450 nm for about 24 h), the conformation
of the azobenzene unit was slowly isomerized from cis to trans in
the complex, which induced the reconstruction of the cross-linked
network and the coagulation gel recovery.21 Finally, we investigated the effect of temperature on the phase
transition of supramolecular hydrogels, as shown in Figure 6. When the gel is heated to
90 °C, hydrogen bonds are broken and the bonding strength between
the host and the guest is impaired, resulting in the formation of
a liquid solution. Once gradually cools to room temperature, the supramolecular
cross-linked network slowly regenerates and restores the solution
to a gel state.

2.2 Adsorption Performances in Dye Removal
The porous microstructure of the currently prepared hydrogel provides
it with excellent mechanical strength and large specific surface area,
which are advantageous for adsorption experiments. The pH of the dye
solution plays an important role in the adsorption process. By controlling
the pH value of the dye solution, we can understand the effect of
electrostatic interactions on the adsorption behavior of dyes. Therefore,
using NaOH or HCl solution to adjust the pH value in the range of
3–11 at room temperature, the adsorption behavior of the hydrogel
adsorbent for dyes was studied (Figure 7a). In acidic solutions (pH < 5), the adsorption
capacity of the hydrogel for MB and rhodamine B (RhB) was weak, but
when the pH value increased from 7 to 11, the adsorption capacity
of the hydrogel adsorbent gradually increased for MB and slightly
reduced for RhB. The pH sensitivity was mainly attributed to two factors:
at acid conditions with pH values 3–5, the protonation of COO– to COOH groups of the polymer and the surface charge
of the hydrogel adsorbent were reduced, which were unfavorable for
the removal of positively charged ionic dyes. Under pH values 9–11,
some of the COOH groups in the hydrogel ionized to COO– and the surface negative charge of the gel adsorbent increased,
which were beneficial for the removal of MB because the electrostatic
attraction to the positively charged MB was enhanced. Some COOH groups
of RhB molecules ionized to COO–, which reduced
the positive charge of dyes, which is disadvantageous for the removal
of RhB. In addition, the swelling behavior of Gel-D in aqueous solution
at different pH values is shown in Figure 7b. The swelling rate of Gel-D changes with
the pH values of the solution, and when the pH value is increased
from 2 to 10, the swelling rate of Gel-D gradually increases, indicating
that the cross-linked structure of the hydrogel changed at different
pH values. Considering the practical application, the adsorption capacity
of the hydrogel was further tested using two organic dye molecules
(MB and RhB) with pH 7. As shown in Figure 8, the prepared hydrogel shows a continuous
adsorption process for MB and RhB. The adsorption equilibrium times
of MB and RhB were about 8 and 30 min. The typical kinetic models
were further utilized to explore the adsorption kinetics.

capacity of Gel-D. (b) Swelling kinetics of Gel-D.

Figure 8 Adsorption kinetics (a) qt versus t plots and (b) t/qt versus t plots for MB and
(c) qt versus t plots
and (d) t/qt versus t plots for RhB.

The pseudo-first-order model is 1  The pseudo-second-order
model is 2  where qe represents
the adsorption capacity at equilibrium time, qt represents the adsorption capacity at time t, and k1 and k2 represent kinetic rate constants. The adsorption fitting results
are listed in Table 2. The fitting data show that the gel conformed to the pseudo-first-order
model with a high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.996) in both MB and RhB adsorption processes, which
was
more accurately described than the pseudo-second-order model. Comparing
Gel-A and Gel-D, the adsorption capacity of Gel-A was 25.86 mg/g for
MB and 11.64 mg/g for RhB. On the contrary, the adsorption capacity
of Gel-D only reached 23.02 mg/g for MB and 7.98 mg/g for RhB. The
larger specific surface area provided adsorption sites, which facilitates
the adsorption of dye molecules. However, the obtained Gel-A exhibited
better dye adsorption capacity than Gel-D, which was possibly attributed
to the electrostatic interaction between MB/RhB and the gel, which
is considered to be the main factor in the adsorption process.31,35 On the other hand, the regeneration of the absorbent material is
also one of the important factors. For the obtained hydrogel adsorbents,
the hydrogel component during regeneration showed a slight loss after
washing with a strong acid solvent, and the reusability performance
does seem less optimistic (Table 3).

and Gel-D for MB and RhB Removal at 298 K
 	pseudo-first-order model	pseudo-second-order model	
qe (mg/g)	R2	K1 (min–1)	qe (mg/g)	R2	K2 [g/(mg min)]

Gel-D	19.44	0.998	0.3761	23.02	0.992	0.0170	
RhB	Gel-A	9.43	0.996	0.0914	11.64	0.987	0.00796	
Gel-D	6.12	0.998	0.0827	7.98	0.988	0.00935	
As we all know, the
adsorption mechanism between adsorbents and
pollutants includes chemical bonds, electrostatic interactions, ion
exchange, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic attraction, van der Waals
forces, and physical adsorption.36−38 In our work, MB and
RhB are positively charged organic molecules, and the −COOH
group in PAA in the gel can anchor MB and RhB molecules via electrostatic
force and hydrogen bonding. Figure 9 illustrates the adsorption mechanism of a hydrogel.
The hydrogel has −OH, −COOH, and other hydrophilic functional
groups and facilitates rapid penetration of dye solutions into the
hydrogel network, which proves the removal efficiency of the prepared
hydrogel. On the other hand, as the anionic structure is composed
of carboxyl and amide groups in the hydrogel and as MB belongs to
a positively charged organic molecule, it interacts with the −COOH
group of the PAA molecular skeleton in the obtained gel through electrostatic
interactions and hydrogen bonds.39−48 In addition, from a practical point of view, the structural stability
of the adsorbent is critical for water purification and environmental
engineering. The microstructure after MB adsorption by Gel-D was further
investigated via SEM, as shown in Figure 10. It can be seen that due to the swelling
of the gel, the cross-linked structure of the gel is slightly deformed
after adsorption. The corresponding element distribution images of
Gel-D-MB are shown in Figure 10b–f. It can be observed that S and Cl elements appear
uniformly in Gel-D-MB, which means that a large number of MB molecules
are adsorbed into the cross-linking network of the hydrogel. It is
expected that the obtained hydrogels can be used to adsorb other cationic
dye molecules, which demonstrates a new clue for the synthesis of
self-assembled nanomaterials and composites.49−58

3 Conclusions
In summary,
new supramolecular hydrogels were designed and prepared
by taking advantage of the self-assembly process. The hydrogels can
form good cross-linked structures without any cross-linking agent
or monomer. The gel materials have porous structures, which is beneficial
to increase the adsorption site of the adsorbent. The UV light irradiation
experiment demonstrated the gel–sol conversion process of the
supramolecular hydrogels due to the cis–trans isomerization
of the azobenzene group. The prepared hydrogels showed the outstanding
adsorption capacity for removing organic pollutants from wastewater.
The adsorption of MB and RhB on the hydrogel adsorbent is consistent
with the pseudo-first-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity
can reach 25.86 mg/g for MB and 11.64 mg/g for RhB. It could be expected
that other cationic dyes could also be removed by the obtained hydrogel
materials. Meanwhile, this work also provides a new clue for developing
self-assembled hydrogels as an efficient adsorbent for wastewater
treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
β-Cyclodextrin (98%,
abbreviated as β-CD), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA, MW = 450 000),
and 4-aminoazobenzene (abbreviated as N-Azo) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and TCL Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
(analytical reagent grade, Shanghai, China). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC-HCl) and N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine
B (RhB) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (analytical
reagent grade, Shanghai, China). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (degree
of polymerization was 1750 ± 50) was purchased from Tianjin Kaitong
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Water used for the preparation of the aqueous
solutions was purified with a two-stage Millipore Milli-Q water purification
system. Other reagents were analytically pure and used without further
purification.

4.2 Synthesis of PAA-CD and
PAA-Azo
The
amine-modified β-CD derivative (abbreviated as NH2-β-CD) was synthesized according to the reported literature.39 PAA-CD was synthesized by the reaction between
the amino group of NH2-β-CD and the carboxyl group
of PAA according to the reported previous studies.59,60 Briefly, PAA (1 g, 1 equiv) was dissolved in water and NHS (3.4
g) and EDC-HCl (5.7 g) were then added under ice bath. The mixture
was further stirred powerfully for 2 h, and then NH2-β-CD
(0.78 g, 0.05 equiv) was added. After stirring under ice bath for
12 h and at room temperature for the next 2 days, the solution was
dialyzed in ultrapure water for 7 days with a dialysis tube (MWCO
= 12 400). After dialysis, a white solid PAA-CD was obtained
by freeze-drying. Following similar dehydration reaction procedures
reported in the previous literature,39 polyacrylic
acid modified with 4-aminoazobenzene (PAA-Azo) was prepared.

4.3 Preparation of the Supramolecular Hydrogels
The dissolved
PAA-CD and PAA-Azo solutions (20 mg/mL) were prepared
by sonication for 5 min. PVA aqueous solutions with various concentrations
(12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg/mL) were prepared and constantly stirred
at 90 °C for 30 min. Then, the PAA-CD solutions (0.5 mL) and
PAA-Azo solutions (0.5 mL) were mixed with the different concentrations
of PVA solutions (1 mL) in a thermostatic bath at 80 °C for 10
min. Then, the mixture was kept at room temperature for 2 h, and the
hydrogels were successfully prepared. The samples were named Gel-A,
Gel-B, Gel-C, and Gel-D, and other details are shown in Table 1.

4.4 Swelling
Behavior Experiments
To
investigate the swelling behavior of the hydrogel at different pH
values, the dried Gel-D was immersed into aqueous solutions (500 mL)
of different pH values at room temperature until the hydrogel reached
equilibrium swelling. During this experiment, water was periodically
replaced several times. The swollen gel was weighed at each predetermined
time. The average of three measurements was taken as the final result.
The swelling ratio (SR) was calculated as follows  where ws and wd represent the weight of the swollen hydrogel
and the weight of the dried hydrogel, respectively.

4.5 Adsorption Test for Dye Removal
Adsorption
experiments were performed by the adsorption of two organic molecules,
methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB). The hydrogel samples (20
mg) were added to each dye solution (MB, 100 mL, 5 mg/L; RhB, 50 mL,
5 mg/L). These dye solutions were stirred slowly at a constant rate
at room temperature in the dark. The supernatants were taken at different
time intervals for further testing using a UV–visible spectrometer.
The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded for the adsorption
stage at wavelengths of 670 nm (MB) and 554 nm (RhB) to determine
the concentration of dyes in the solutions. To determine the adsorption
effect of dye solutions at different pH values (3–11), the
initial pH values of dye solution were adjusted by using 1 M HCl and
NaOH solutions.

4.6 Characterization
The xerogels used
in the present study were acquired using a lyophilizer at −50
°C with an FD-1C-50 lyophilizer instrument from Beijing Boyikang
Experimental Instrument Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) to completely remove
water over 2–3 days. The microstructure of the xerogels was
observed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800II,
Hitachi, Japan) with 0.5–30 kV accelerating voltage as well
as transmission electron microscopy with 20 kV accelerating voltage
(TEM, HT7700, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan). X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (SMART LAB, Rigaku;
Rigaku D/MAX-2500/PC) with Cu Kα X-ray radiation. The infrared
spectra were characterized by Fourier infrared spectroscopy (Nicolet
Corporation) by the KBr sheet method. UV–vis absorption spectra
of the samples were recorded on a 752-type UV–vis spectrometer
(Sunny Hengping Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).
The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined
using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (ASAP
2460).
