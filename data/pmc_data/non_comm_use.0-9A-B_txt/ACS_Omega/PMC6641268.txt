Enhancing the activity
and stability of catalysts is a major challenge
in scientific research nowadays. Previous studies showed that the
generation of an additional pore system can influence the catalytic
performance of porous catalysts regarding activity, selectivity, and
stability. This study focuses on the epoxide-mediated sol–gel
synthesis of mixed metal oxides, NiAl2O4 and
CoAl2O4, with a spinel phase structure, a hierarchical
pore structure, and Ni and Co contents of 3 to 33 mol % with respect
to the total metal content. The sol–gel process is accompanied
by a polymerization-induced phase separation to introduce an additional
pore system. The obtained mixed metal oxides were characterized with
regard to pore morphology, surface area, and formation of the spinel
phase. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area ranges
from 74 to 138 m2·g–1 and 25 to
94 m2·g–1 for Ni and Co, respectively.
Diameters of the phase separation-based macropores were between 500
and 2000 nm, and the mesopore diameters were 10 nm for the Ni-based
system and between 20 and 25 nm for the cobalt spinels. Furthermore,
Ni–Al spinels with 4, 5, and 6 mol % Ni were investigated in
the dry reforming of CH4 (DRM) with CO2 to produce
H2 and CO. CH4 conversions near the thermodynamic
equilibrium were observed depending on the Ni content and reaction
temperature. The Ni catalysts were further compared to a noble metal-containing
catalyst based on a spinel system showing comparable CH4 conversion and carbon selectivity in the DRM.

==== Body
Introduction
In the last two decades,
mixed metal oxides with a spinel structure
(AB2O4) have considerably gained importance
as thermally stable pigments,1−3 cathode materials,4 and catalysts.5−7 Three types of spinels are known,
whose structure results from the different atomic radii and lattice
energies.8 The normal spinel consists of
a cubic closely packed primitive cell of O2–, where
one-eighth of the tetrahedral voids are filled with A2+, whereas half of the octahedral voids are filled with B3+, as found for CoAl2O4, Mn3O4, and ZnAl2O4.8,9 In
the inverse spinel, for example, Fe3O4, CoFe2O4, and NiFe2O4, A2+ fills the octahedral voids, whereas half of B3+ is shifted
to the tetrahedral voids.8 The third type
is the disordered spinel (NiAl2O4), in which
A2+ and B3+ are statistically allocated to the
octahedral and tetrahedral voids.8

Regarding the implementation of spinels in the field of heterogeneous
catalysis and possible industrial applications, several studies have
evaluated the activity of spinel-based materials in catalytic test
reactions. Although these studies were restricted on a laboratory
scale, the high potential as catalysts offered by these systems was
illustrated. Table 1 gives an overview of spinels evaluated in catalytic test reactions.

Within these
examples, the dry reforming of CH4 (DRM)
takes a special role because the spinel acts as a precursor for the
catalytically active NiO formed via reduction. Moreover, catalysts
based on NiAl2O4 or CoAl2O4 could represent a low-cost alternative to commonly used DRM catalysts
based on noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Rh).10−12

The solid-state
chemistry represents a simple approach to spinels
and mixed metal oxides.19 Usually inorganic
metal salts or metal oxides are mixed and treated thermally at temperatures
between 773 and 1773 K. However, this method suffers from weak reproducibility,
generation of multiphase systems, very low specific surface areas,
and long reaction times because of the slow solid-state diffusion
processes. To generate materials with higher specific surface area,
approaches based on wet chemistry are more promising. Coprecipitation,20 sonochemical methods,21 and especially the sol–gel route result in high surface area
particles that can exhibit spinel structures. Previous studies described
the sol–gel process as an efficient way for the synthesis of
mixed metal oxides with a high surface area, high purity, and good
chemical homogeneity.22

However,
the conventional sol–gel method is based on metal
alkoxides as precursors, which is not straightforward for the preparation
of mixed metal oxides. The difficulty results from the different susceptibility
to hydrolysis for most alkoxide precursors, resulting in inhomogeneous
morphologies and a nonuniform metal distribution.

Metal salts
(e.g., chlorides or nitrates) that can form complexes
of the type [M(H2O)6]n+ after dissolution in an aqueous solution offer an alternative
to alkoxides. Their usage as precursors for the sol–gel process
was first described by Gash et al.23 Gelation
was induced through the addition of “proton scavengers”
such as epoxides that cause the deprotonation of the aqueous complex
while undergoing an irreversible ring opening reaction itself. Whereas
the slow increase of the pH value causes uniform hydrolysis, the deprotonated
metal complexes undergo condensation reactions via oxolation and olation,
forming dimers. These are followed by trimers that can further condense
to form larger ionic structures.24

In general, the sol–gel synthesis leads to the formation
of mesoporous mixed metal oxides with a high surface area. However,
an important feature of solid catalysts is the cooperation of high
surface area and efficient mass transfer. To enable this interaction,
the creation of a hierarchical pore structure by incorporating an
additional macropore system is a promising technique.25 Nakanishi et al. first reported the polymerization-induced
phase separation during gelation as an approach to obtain an additional
macropore system.26 A polymeric component
[polyethylene oxide (PEO)] is added to the initial sol, which forms
a second, separated phase during the gelation. The driving force of
the phase separation is an increased Gibbs free energy resulting from
a compositional change due to the increased condensation of the inorganic
species (sol) during the sol–gel transition. The subsequent
loss of mixing entropy results in a decreased stability of the entire
system. As a consequence, a phase-separated system with two interconnected
phases is formed, consisting of the condensed inorganic phase and
the organic polymer phase, while the solvent is homogeneously distributed
in both phases.27 A macroporous interconnected
network of mesoporous struts is obtained after the thermal removal
of the polymeric phase.

Such a hierarchical pore structure based
on a macroporous network
formed by the phase separation and the mesopores that are formed during
the sol–gel-transition are highly advantageous in the field
of heterogeneous catalysis.28 The small
mesopores can act as reaction pores and thereby increase the specific
surface area significantly. Because of the larger macropores, a very
efficient mass transfer to and from the reaction pores can be achieved,
which can suppress diffusion limitation often present during catalytic
reactions.29

The combination of epoxide-mediated
sol–gel synthesis and
polymerization-induced phase separation establishes access to various
different mixed metal and nonmetal oxides with a hierarchical pore
structure. Preceding studies featured the preparation of macroporous
Al2O3 doped with Cr3+ and hierarchically
structured Mullite (3Al2O3·2SiO2).30,31 Most recently, iron-based aerogels with
a spinel structure (ABET = 150 to 270
m2·g–1) were successfully prepared
starting from chloride salts of the first row d-block elements (Co,
Ni, Cu, and Zn).32 Ferrite spinels with
different spinel structures (inverse spinel: CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4; normal spinel: ZnFe2O4; mixed spinel: CuFe2O4) were detected via X-ray diffraction (XRD). The preparation of hierarchically
structured iron-based xerogel monoliths by the addition of poly(acrylamide)
(PAAm) as a porogen was first described in 2013 and later extended
to the preparation of macroporous zinc ferrite.33,34 Depending on the solvent composition and PAAm concentration, well-defined
macropore morphologies were obtained with pore sizes between 1300
and 1900 nm for iron oxide xerogels and between 550 and 1290 nm for
zinc ferrite xerogels. Furthermore, additional micropores were generated
by removing fine carbon particles formed during calcination under
an argon stream. The iron oxide monolith’s Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area was found to be between 5 and 262 m2·g–1.

However, to the best of our knowledge,
to this day, there are no
reports of hierarchically structured spinel systems composed of NiAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 and their
applicability. Herein, we report the preparation of NiAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 by the epoxide-mediated
sol–gel synthesis accompanied by polymerization-induced phase
separation. Furthermore, the catalytic properties of NiAl2O4 in the DRM were investigated.

Results and Discussion
Modification
of the Synthesis Procedure
The preparation
of hierarchically structured alumina materials with adjustable macropore
sizes, based on the method of Tokudome et al.,37 was only possible for a small amount of PEO in the reaction
mixture. Higher amounts of PEO led to the absence of an interconnected
structure and a particle-like morphology in the final product. The
synthesis, as described by Tokudome et al.,37 was carried out at room temperature, at which the pH increased rapidly
from 0.5 (solution of AlCl3·6H2O in EtOH/H2O) to 2.5. Hence, gelation was completed within 3 min after
the addition of propylene oxide (PO) (Figure 1). In contrast to that, aluminum hexaqua
complexes were stable up to a pH of 3.38 Therefore, the complete gelation of the Tokudome-based system at
pH < 3 can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperature
up to 313 K because of the exothermic ring opening of PO during hydrolysis.
The rapid gelation fixes the system (sol–gel-transition) prior
to the complete phase separation. Consequently, the macropore morphology
cannot be controlled exactly.

Figure 1 Behavior of pH (black) and temperature (red)
over the reaction
time for the AlCl3·6H2O sol–gel
system (without addition of NiCl2·6H2O
or CoCl2·6H2O) without cooling, as suggested
by Tokudome et al.,37 and with cooling
of the initial sol to 278 K prior and during the addition of PO.

The gelation process was decelerated
by cooling the system to 278
K prior to the addition of PO, thus leading to a pH of 2.5 after 15
min and a completed gelation after an elongated time of 25 min at
pH 2.9 (Figure 1).
This difference in the gelation time to the original protocol37 is significant to control the development of
the macropores.

A prolonged gelation time leads to a fully phase-separated
system
and the possibility to control the macropore morphology by variation
of the polymer content. The so-called interconnected structures of
the macropores and the mesoporous alumina skeleton can be achieved
over a wide range of the PEO content. Mercury porosimetry (not shown)
indicated no altering effect on the mesopore structure; the pore diameter
remains constant at 8 nm. The modification of the procedure (cooling)
has nearly no effect on the macropore size, which can be varied between
500 and 2000 nm depending on the PEO content. The extended gelation
time increases the number of generated macropores and mesopores, which
is indicated by the pore volume that is twice as large as observed
by Tokudome.37

Ni–Al System
The measured contents of Ni and
Al are in good agreement with the calculated Ni and Al contents from
the initial mass of NiCl2·6H2O and AlCl3·6H2O [inductive coupled plasma-optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) results shown in the Supporting Information, Table S1]. For all samples, the deviation is ≤
6%, at which an increasing Ni content results in a smaller deviation.
A linescan during the scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) measurement (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1) shows a similar intensity
profile for the Kα1 emission of Ni and Al atoms over
the surface. This indicates a homogeneous distribution of Ni in the
Al2O3 matrix.

The Ni–Al system
underwent several color changes during the synthesis. Prior to gelation,
the solution of NiCl2·6H2O and AlCl3·6H2O had a clear green color, which changed
to blue during gelation and back to green for the dried monolith.
The intensity of the samples’ color depends on the Ni content;
hence the green color of the samples with 33 mol % Ni was more intense
than that of the samples with 3 mol % Ni. Finally, the monoliths exhibited
a blue color after calcination at 1223 K for 12 h, which is typical
for NiAl2O4.

SEM images were recorded
to investigate the morphologies. Thereby,
a well-defined interconnected alumina network (Figure 2 left) was found for the samples with 3 mol
% Ni (3Ni-1, 3Ni-2). With increasing Ni content, the macropore structure
is maintained but exhibits a more particulate shape, as seen for 22Ni
and 33Ni (Figure 2 middle
and right). Because of an increased amount of PEO (3.5 × 10–6 mol %) in the second synthesis approach of 3Ni-2,
22Ni-2, and 33Ni-2, the phase separation is promoted,37 and consequently, the resulting macropores are enlarged
in contrast to the samples from the first synthesis approach with
2.8 × 10–6 mol % PEO (3Ni-1, 22Ni-1, and 33Ni-1).
This behavior is the most notable on comparing the SEM images of the
3Ni samples (Figure 2 left). The morphology of the macropore system of the samples with
the highest Ni content (33Ni-1 and 33Ni-2) exhibits a pure particulate
structure.

Figure 2 SEM images of samples with increasing Ni content (left to right)
and increasing PEO content (top to bottom).

The effect of Ni and PEO contents on the pore morphology
was investigated
with mercury porosimetry (Table 2). An increased PEO content at a constant Ni content
leads to larger macropores because the tendency toward phase separation
is increased.37 The pore diameter of 3Ni
increases from 1040 nm for 3Ni-1 to 1396 nm for 3Ni-2. Nevertheless,
the volume of the phase separation-based pores (macropores) is nearly
unaffected by an increasing PEO content and ranges between 0.59 and
1.17 cm3·g–1 for all samples. The
macropore size decreases significantly with increasing Ni content,
while keeping the PEO content stable. As can be seen in Table 2, the macropores shrink, for
example, from 1040 nm (3Ni-1) to 547 nm (33Ni-1) and from 1396 nm
(3Ni-2) to 662 nm (33Ni-2). Thereby, the macropore volume increases
with increasing Ni content from 0.76 to 1.17 cm3·g–1 (3Ni-1 and 33Ni-1) and from 0.59 to 1.15 cm3·g–1 (3Ni-2 and 33Ni-2).

This
behavior is based on the influence of Ni on the sol–gel
process: because the Ni precursor (NiCl2·6H2O) exhibits a different hydrolysis and condensation behavior compared
to the Al precursor (AlCl3·6H2O), the sol–gel-transition
and the resulting phase separation are affected by the amount of Ni
in the sol. The macropore morphology can further be affected by the
formation of Ni–PEO complexes that can delay the onset of the
phase separation.39 Thus, at the point
of the sol–gel-transition, the system is fixated in an early
stage of phase separation, with smaller pores, higher pore volume,
and higher number of pores. Regarding the mesopore morphology, there
is no distinct tendency for the pore diameter. The differences are
in the range of the methodical error. However, a decreasing mesopore
volume at elevated Ni contents reflects an interference of Ni on the
sol–gel-transition. Nevertheless, a higher degree of Ni integration
into the Al2O3 network can be observed with
increasing Ni concentration.

Besides mercury porosimetry, nitrogen
sorption was applied to investigate
the pore structure of the samples and to determine the BET surface
area. Nitrogen sorption reveals type IV isotherms with a H1 hysteresis
loop for all samples, as can be seen in Figure 3. In accordance with the results from mercury
porosimetry, the pore volume ranges from 0.3 to 0.4 cm3·g–1. Furthermore, a decreasing specific surface
area from 138 to 74 m2·g–1 at a
constant polymer and increasing Ni content (Table 2) can be observed. This behavior directly
correlates with the decreased mesopore volume in 33Ni-2 compared to
3Ni-2. The decrease of the pore volume by 33% together with a nearly
unchanged mesopore diameter indicates a higher porosity in 3Ni-2,
which results in a higher BET surface area. Furthermore, the increase
of PEO as a porogen and a subsequent enlargement of the macropores
do not influence the BET surface area significantly.

of the Ni–Al samples at different
Ni contents (●, ■, and ▲: adsorption branch;
○, □, and △: desorption branch).

The materials’ crystal phases were studied
by XRD with respect
to a varying Ni–Al molar ratio (Figure 4). The material with the lowest Ni content
(3Ni) features solely γ-Al2O3 reflections,
which is characterized by a defective spinel structure. Here, several
tetrahedral and octahedral voids are vacant compared to the normal
spinel structure.8 Therefore, the reflections
of γ-Al2O3 are similar to the reflections
of NiAl2O4, but shifted by 2° to higher
2θ values. In the case of 22Ni, the reflections are slightly
shifted to lower 2θ values and lie between the typical reflections
of NiAl2O4 and γ-Al2O3. This indicates that a mixed phase exists, containing NiAl2O4 and γ-Al2O3. The assumption
is confirmed by the disappearance of the typical γ-Al2O3 reflection at 37.6° 2θ with increasing Ni
content. The slight shift between the typical reflections may result
from the integration of Ni in the γ-Al2O3 network. At the hypostoichiometric Ni contents (22 mol %), Ni occupies
the defects in the defect spinel structure of γ-Al2O3 and forms the spinel. The integration of Ni results
in a distortion of the γ-Al2O3 structure
and the shift toward lower 2θ values. In the case of the exact
spinel composition of 33 mol % Ni (33Ni), the reflections can be attributed
primarily to the NiAl2O4 phase. The ratio of
the reflection intensities of 37° and 45° 2θ further
proves the presence of the spinel phase. In γ-Al2O3, the intensity ratio is 1.6:1 for the aforementioned
reflections, whereas it is 2.6:1 for NiAl2O4. The latter ratio was found in the XRD pattern of the exact spinel
composition with 33 mol % Ni. Still, this sample features additional
reflections at 43.3°, 62.8°, and 75.4° 2θ, which
can be attributed to the formation of NiO. “Excess”
Ni that was not integrated into the structure accumulated on the surface
of the sample and was oxidized during calcination, which is manifested
by the formation of a green layer on the outside of the sample.8

Figure 4 XRD patterns of Ni–Al samples with Ni contents
of 3, 22,
and 33 mol % (bottom to top).

The existence of NiAl2O4 rather than
a mixture
of NiO and Al2O3 was further confirmed by ultraviolet–visible
(UV–Vis) spectroscopy. Bands from 360 to 380 nm and from 550
to 700 nm (Figure 5) were detected. These bands were shifted toward higher wavelengths
with increasing Ni content. Additionally, the intensity of the absorption
bands becomes more pronounced with increasing Ni content. Here, 3Ni
features only weak bands between 550 and 650 nm, which are more dominant
for 22Ni and 33Ni. The recorded spectra are in good accordance with
the literature.40,41 Nevertheless, additional bands
are described at 260, 325, and 710 nm.41 As can be seen in Figure 5, these bands are visible as shoulders at 320 and 720 nm for
22Ni and 33Ni, respectively. According to the literature,8,40,41 the bands can be assigned to
different electron transitions in the ligand field. The bands at 380
nm [3A2g(F) → 3T1g(P)] and 715 nm [3A2g(F) → 3T1g(F)] can be assigned to the octahedral coordination
of Ni2+. But the doublet at 600 and 640 nm, as visible
in Figure 5, indicates
Ni2+ in a tetrahedral coordination.40,41 The existence of Ni2+ in both octahedral and tetrahedral
coordinations further proves the presence of NiAl2O4 and confirms a disordered spinel structure.8

Co–Al System
The ICP-OES
(see the Supporting Information, Table
S2) results reveal
a deviation of only 2% between the measured and calculated Co and
Al contents from the initial mass of CoCl2·6H2O and AlCl3·6H2O. The good agreement
between both values indicates that nearly no Co species was extracted
during the washing process of the gelated bodies. Furthermore, the
small deviation and the uniform color of the calcined samples denote
that Co is homogeneously distributed in the Al2O3 network, without the occurrence of the clustered Co species. Additionally,
the distribution of Co and Al was investigated by SEM-EDX linescans
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). As
it was found for the Ni–Al system, the emission profiles of
Kα1 radiation for Co and Al over the scanned surface
are comparable, indicating a homogeneous distribution of both species.

Similar to the Ni–Al system, the samples in the Co–Al
system underwent several color changes during the synthesis. Prior
to gelation, the solution of CoCl2·6H2O
and AlCl3·6H2O had a dark blue color. The
intensity of the color thereby depended on the Co content, being more
intense for higher Co concentrations. The addition of PO caused a
slow color change from blue to purple and eventually to pink. Drying
at 323 K and calcination at 1323 K finally led to a color shift back
to blue. In analogy to the Ni–Al system, the calcined sample
with the highest Co content (33Co) exhibited a dark olive colored
layer on the outside that indicates the existence of additional cobalt
oxide species. The specific color corresponds to the coordination
of Co2+. Tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ exhibits
a blue color, as seen in the solution of CoCl2·6H2O, whereas an octahedral coordination of Co2+ is
indicated by a pink coloration,8 comparable
to the color of the observed gel body. In an aqueous ethanol solution
of CoCl2·6H2O, an equilibrium of cobalt
exists, consisting of the hexaqua complex [Co(H2O)6]2+ (octahedral) and the tetrachloro cobaltate(II)
complex [CoCl4]2– (tetrahedral). A slow
increase of the pH value was achieved after the addition of PO, and
a subsequent consumption of Cl– occurs because of
the irreversible ring opening and formation of 1-chloro-2-propanol.23 The consumption of Cl– results
in a shift of the equilibrium toward octahedrally coordinated Co2+ (pink color). During calcination, the typical cobalt blue
spinel CoAl2O4 is formed in which Co2+ now occupies the tetrahedral voids.8

As seen in the SEM images (Figure 6), a change of the alumina network comparable to those
of the Ni–Al system can be observed. The addition of Co2+ influences the morphology of the macropore structure: low
Co contents (3Co-1, Figure 6 left) result in a well-defined interconnected structure with
distinct struts. In case of higher Co contents (33Co-1 and 33Co-2),
an interconnected structure with a more particle-like shape (Figure 6 right) is obtained.
Besides higher Co contents, increasing the PEO content to 3.5 ×
10–6 mol % resulted in a particular shape of the
macropore structure (Figure 6 bottom row) because of an increased tendency toward phase
separation.

Figure 6 SEM images of samples with increasing Co content (left to right)
and increasing PEO content (top to bottom).

Mercury porosimetry (Table 3) of the Co–Al system reveals tendencies in
the macropore
morphology similar to the Ni–Al system: at a higher PEO content,
the macropore size increases, whereas the pore volume shows no specific
tendency and ranges for all samples between 0.80 and 1.30 cm3·g–1. A decreasing macropore size to less
than the half of the width was observed on increasing the Co content
from 3 to 33 mol % and keeping the PEO amount constant. Hence, no
effect on the pore volume was found. The integration of Co into the
Al2O3 network can influence the sol–gel-transition
and subsequently the phase separation because of the different hydrolysis
and condensation behavior of the Co precursor (CoCl2·6H2O) compared to the Al system (AlCl3·6H2O). This effect is only reflected by a sharp decrease of the
mesopore volume by 79–80%. However, regarding the mesopore
diameter, there is no tendency observable. The Co system is more sensitive
and susceptible to system changes, which leads to stronger deviations
under slightly varying synthesis conditions (temperature) or Co precursor
masses. The result is a higher variation of the mesopore diameter
compared to the Ni system.

Nitrogen
sorption of the material reveals type IV isotherms, as
shown in Figure 7.
The BET surface area, also obtained from the nitrogen sorption measurements,
shows a direct correlation with the Co content. The sample 3Co-2 exhibits
a specific surface area of 94 m2·g–1, whereas 33Co-2 exhibits a surface area of only 25 m2·g–1. The structural change of the macropore
morphology from an interconnected to a particle-like structure plays
just a marginal role in the decrease of the surface area. Hence, the
significant reduction of 65% at higher Co concentrations can be correlated
with the strongly decreasing mesopore volume. Here, a loss of ∼80%
from 0.46 cm3·g–1 (3Co-2) to 0.09
cm3·g–1 (33Co-2) was found. The
loss of mesopore volume is sharper compared to that of the Ni–Al
system, and therefore, the reduction of the surface area is more pronounced
in the Co–Al system. These findings indicate a strong interference
of Co2+ during the sol–gel-transition. Another reason
for the decreasing BET surface areas at high Co concentrations could
also be the nonporous Co species enriched at the monoliths’
outer layer.

toward lower 2θ values. In the case of the Co-poor sample (3Co),
two different alumina species, namely γ- and θ-Al2O3, can be found (Figure 8 bottom). Whereas all reflections are shifted
to lower 2θ values with increasing Co content (22Co and 33Co),
the θ-Al2O3 phase cannot be detected anymore.
The intensity of the reflections at 45°, 60°, and 66°
is changed from γ-Al2O3 in favor of CoAl2O4. Furthermore, the position and intensity of
the reflexes at 31.2°, 36.8°, 59.2°, and 65.1°
can be clearly assigned to the spinel phase, thus indicating a mixture
of γ-Al2O3 and CoAl2O4 in 22Co and primarily CoAl2O4 in 33Co. An
additional XRD pattern of the dark olive green layer deposited on
the outside of the 33Co monolith was recorded. A close-up look at
the reflections at 2θ = 31.2°, 36.8°, 55.5°,
59.2°, and 65.1° indicates the presence of an additional
crystal phase formed during calcination (Figure 9). It can be assumed that the double reflections
originate from CoAl2O4 and because of an excess
of Co (also Co3O4). The latter are shifted by
0.2° to higher 2θ values. In case of the reflections at
31.2° and 36.8° 2θ, Co3O4 only
appears as a shoulder of the typical CoAl2O4 reflection. Looking back at the nitrogen sorption results, this
nonporous Co3O4 phase, enriched on the outer
layer of the monoliths, might promote the effect of the decreasing
surface area for Co rich samples.

Co contents of 3, 22,
and 33 mol % (bottom to top).

Figure 9 Magnified XRD pattern of the outer layer of 33Co with CoAl2O4 and Co3O4 reflections.

In the cobalt aluminum spinel,
Co2+ can exist in both
tetrahedral and octahedral coordinations. In the octahedral field,
both high- and low-spin configurations occur. Nevertheless, Co2+ prefers the tetrahedral coordination because of the weak
octahedral stabilization energy and the high energetic stabilization
of the half- and fully occupied orbitals of this (high-spin) coordination.8 In the UV–vis spectra (Figure 10), three distinctive bands
at wavelengths between 500 and 700 nm as well as two smaller bands
between 400 and 500 nm can be identified. With increasing Co content,
the intensity of the band at 480 nm increases, whereas the intensity
of the band at 408 nm decreases. Furthermore, the bands at 550 and
580 nm and their corresponding transitions [4A2(F) → 4T1(P) and 4A2(F) → 2T(G)] are shifted to higher wavelengths
and can be assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+.3,42,43 An additional band between 300
and 400 nm, visible as a shoulder, was recorded for 33Co. This band
can be attributed to Co2+ occupying octahedral voids and
forming a partially inverse spinel3,44,45 or to the Co3O4 phase formed
from excessive Co2+.

samples.

DRM
It was investigated
whether the hierarchical pore
structure of the Ni spinel-based materials leads to an enhanced catalytic
activity in the DRM with CO2 compared to a Ni catalyst
with a monomodal pore structure.46 Recently
published articles suggest that the CH4 conversion using
sol–gel-based NiAl2O4 is higher compared
to catalysts prepared by other methods (e.g., impregnation).47−49 The sol–gel synthesis leads to a higher dispersion of the
active phase and prevents the formation of agglomerates.50 No NiO reflections were observed in the XRD
patterns at lower Ni contents, and Ni was integrated into the alumina
matrix during preparation. Thereby, the Ni spinel is formed, which
on comparison to bulk NiO is only hardly reducible because of very
strong metal-support interactions. As can be seen in Figure 11, NiO is primarily present
in the spinel phase (Tred > 1000 K).
Bulk
NiO (Tred = 600 K) was not observed and
only traces of NiO were detected by temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR). These NiO traces show weak interactions to the γ-Al2O3 phase and are not bound to the spinel phase.

Figure 11 TPR
profile of 4Ni–H.

In a first step, DRM was studied over the hierarchical structured
catalyst containing 4 mol % Ni (4Ni–H). The reaction temperature
was varied in steps of 50 K from 1023 to 1123 K at an overall gas
hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 6000 h–1. As can
be seen in Figure 12 (left), the catalyst containing 4 mol % Ni shows a high activity
without the occurrence of an activation period, as it is often observed
for other Ni-containing catalysts.35,51 Because of
the endothermic nature of the reaction, increasing CH4 and
CO2 conversions at elevated reaction temperatures can be
observed. Therefore, the CH4 conversion of 62% at 1023
K increases to 80% at 1073 K and even to 90% at 1123 K. The catalytic
conversion is near the thermodynamic equilibrium (XCH4 = 94.6%) at 1123 K. Only sample 4Ni–H
shows a decreasing CH4 conversion over the time-on-stream
(TOS) of 15 h at the lowest reaction temperature, indicative of catalyst
deactivation.

Figure 12 CH4 conversion in the dry reforming over 4Ni–H
(4 mol % Ni) at 1023, 1073, and 1123 K (left) and CH4 conversion
at 1123 K over 4Ni–H, 5Ni–H, and 6Ni–H (4, 5,
and 6 mol % Ni) (right) (because of the higher magnification in the
right graph, the decrease at ∼2 h becomes more evident).

To investigate the effect of the
Ni content on the catalytic activity,
catalysts with slightly varying Ni contents were investigated in the
DRM at 1123 K (Figure 12 right). The catalysts 4Ni–H, 5Ni–H, and 6Ni–H
(4, 5 and 6 mol % Ni) all had a high initial activity, whereas the
CH4 conversion increases with increasing metal content
(88.5% for 4Ni–H to > 90% for 6Ni–H). But in all
cases,
the CH4 conversion goes through a slight minimum at ∼2
h TOS with a decrease of 0.2–0.5%. This behavior is often observed
for Ni-containing DRM catalysts.51,52 Nevertheless,
after 15 h TOS, 4Ni–H and 5Ni–H show a nearly identical
CH4 conversion of around 89%, whereas a slightly increased
Ni content of 6 mol % (6Ni–H) results in a CH4 conversion
of 90% after 15 h TOS. Therefore, the effect of the metal content
on the hierarchical catalysts is negligibly low and well within the
experimental error.

During the dry reforming, undesired side
reactions occur; whereas
the reverse water gas shift reaction causes a syngas molar ratio of
< 1, CH4 decomposition and Boudouard reaction often
result in the deactivation of the catalyst because of the extensive
carbon formation on the surface of the active phase. With focus on
the amount of deposited carbon, 4Ni–H (4 mol % Ni) accumulates
less carbon than both the other catalysts. Still, values of ≤
0.1 g·g–1 carbon per catalyst mass for all
three samples show the high potential of the hierarchical catalysts
toward carbon suppression. The amount of carbon deposited via CH4 decomposition was summarized as carbon selectivity (Csel), as can be seen in Figure 13 for several samples. Here, the effect of
the reaction temperature was also taken into account (reduction temperature
1023 K). As expected, the Csel directly correlates with
the reaction temperature because DRM is a highly endothermic reaction,
and the side reaction cannot be suppressed below 1023 K. The exothermic
Boudouard reaction is most prominent at lower temperatures, whereas
endothermic CH4 decomposition occurs at elevated temperatures.53 The Csel is significantly decreased
if the reaction temperature is elevated by 50 K. Besides the effect
of the reaction temperature, elevated Ni contents enhance the carbon
formation tendency. When the Ni content is increased from 4 to 6 mol
%, the Csel is raised from 0.02 to 0.04% (Figure 13), which can be attributed
to a larger number of active sites on the catalyst with the higher
Ni content.

Figure 13 Csel for 4Ni–H and 6Ni–H at temperatures
of 1023, 1073, and 1123 K.

Generally, noble metal-containing catalysts show high conversions
and a low tendency to deactivate. To compare the pure Ni catalysts
to a noble metal catalyst, a spinel containing 0.5 mol % Rh and 3
mol % Ce as promoters in addition to 4 mol % Ni was prepared.

Figure 14 shows
an increased conversion over the complete TOS for 4NiRh–H and
4Ni–H compared to 4NiRh–M, which is only mesoporous.
In the presence of additional macropores, the conversion is higher
by 3%, that is, ∼90%. This shows the potential of DRM catalysts
with a hierarchical pore structure. Furthermore, under equivalent
reaction conditions (1123 K, GHSV = 6000 h–1), the
direct comparison between the hierarchical Rh-containing catalyst
4NiRh–H and the noble metal-free catalyst 4Ni–H shows
the absence of a conversion minimum and a higher conversion of 4NiRh
H during the first 4–5 h TOS. After 5 h TOS, 4NiRh–H
and 4Ni–H show comparable CH4 conversions of ∼90%.
Both catalysts have a hierarchical pore structure and comparable specific
surface area (> 150 m2·g–1) and
yielded equivalent CH4 conversions and molar ratio of the
resulting syngas. Because of an already high level of DRM activity
and low carbon formation tendency, it can be assumed that the influence
of the noble metal and promoter can be neglected. The hierarchical
spinel containing only Ni can be seen as a promising alternative to
the more expensive noble metal catalyst. Even though the syngas molar
ratio (not shown) was comparable for 4NiRh–H and 4NiRh–M,
nearly double the amount of carbon and twice as high Csel were found for the monomodal, mesoporous catalyst 4NiRh–M
(Figure 15).

Figure 14 XCH4 at 1123 K over TOS
of 15 h for 4Ni–H (4 mol % Ni, meso- and macroporous), 4NiRh–H
(4 mol % Ni, 0.5 mol % Rh, meso- and macroporous), and 4NiRh–M
(4 mol % Ni, 0.5 mol % Rh, mesoporous).

Figure 15 Csel for 4NiRh–H, 4NiRh–M, and 4Ni–H
at 1123 K.

Comparing 4NiRh–H
and 4Ni–H, it needs to be mentioned
that the noble metal-containing hierarchical catalyst accumulated
less carbon compared to the noble metal-free catalyst. This is indicated
by a Csel, which is decreased by a factor of 3.5 for 4NiRh–H
compared to 4Ni–H. But looking at 4NiRh–M, a comparable
tendency to deposit carbon was found, similar to the hierarchical
catalysts with only 4 mol % Ni. Hence, the addition of the macropore
network allows the noble metal-free catalyst to challenge the mesoporous
Rh-containing catalyst. Nevertheless, elevated CH4 conversions
and negligibly low carbon formation tendency (< 0.1 g·g–1 carbon per catalyst mass), without significant deactivation,
was found for all studied (hierarchical) catalysts during the DRM
over 15 h TOS.

Conclusions
Here, the preparation
of hierarchically structured spinels of the
type MAl2O4, based on Ni and Co, via an epoxide-mediated
sol–gel synthesis is reported. The addition of PEO leads to
a polymerization-induced phase separation and the formation of macropores
in the range of 547 to 1396 nm for the Ni–Al system and 547
to 1311 nm for the Co–Al system. A variation of the macropore
size is possible by either changing the polymer and/or metal (Ni or
Co) concentration. Generally, controlling the macropore structure
was achieved with a modification of the original synthesis procedure37 because the step of initial cooling of the synthesis
solution increased the gelation time significantly. The mesopores
resulting from the sol–gel process exhibit diameters in the
range of 11 to 16 nm. XRD and UV–vis spectroscopy proved the
existence of the spinel phase and showed that the obtained NiAl2O4 systems are characterized by a disordered spinel
structure, whereas the new CoAl2O4 materials
have a normal spinel structure.

Furthermore, we report on the
applicability of the hierarchical
NiAl2O4 spinel as a high surface area catalyst
for the DRM. Over the Ni spinel-based catalysts, CH4 conversions
of up to 90% are reached. The catalyst, containing 4 mol % Ni and
with a hierarchical pore structure, shows a comparable performance
to a noble metal-containing analogue. Especially at a reaction temperature
of 1123 K, the feed gas conversions and syngas molar ratio are near
the thermodynamic equilibrium while only traces of carbon are deposited.
On comparing 4NiRh–H and 4NiRh–M, it can be assumed
that the low Csel is promoted by the hierarchical pore
structure, as already suggested in the literature. The obtained results
of NiAl2O4 as DRM catalysts show the potential
of hierarchical Ni spinels in catalytic gas-phase reactions at elevated
temperatures. Still, further investigations on the role of the macropores
during the DRM reaction need to be conducted.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Starting Composition
Metal chlorides
as precursors, namely AlCl3·6H2O (97%,
Alfa Aesar) and NiCl2·6H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar)
or CoCl2·6H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar), were dissolved
in a mixture of distilled water and ethanol (100%, Bioenergie Icking
GmbH). Polymerization-induced phase separation was achieved by the
addition of PEO (MW 900 000, Acros Organics) as a porogen,
whereas PO (99.5%, extra pure, Acros Organics) was used as a gelation
agent. The molar ratios of the composition are shown in Table 4.

Regarding the
samples investigated in the DRM, the Ni contents
differed from the contents described in Table 4. As shown by Stolze et al.,35 a Ni content of 5 mol % proves to be suitable regarding
the activity and carbon formation tendency. Therefore, samples investigated
in the DRM had Ni contents of 4 mol % (4Ni–H), 5 mol % (5Ni–H),
and 6 mol % (6Ni–H). The molar ratios of Ni–Al were
0.04, 0.05, and 0.06. Nevertheless, the molar ratios between the metals
(Al + Ni) and EtOH (5.4), H2O (18.1), PO (3.1), and PEO
(3.5 × 10–6) as well as the synthesis procedure
were unaltered. Besides the Ni catalysts, samples containing noble
metal promoters in addition to Ni were prepared. These were either
mesoporous or hierarchically structured with a meso/macroporous network
and contained 0.5 mol % Rh and 3 mol % Ce as promoter and additionally
4 mol % Ni. The samples were labeled 4NiRh–H for the hierarchical
meso- and macroporous catalyst and 4NiRh–M for the mesoporous
catalyst. The addition of the respective amounts of Rh and Ce was
proved to enhance the CH4 conversion while decreasing the
C-selectivity.36 The synthesis procedure
remained unchanged, except for the addition of the respective amounts
of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.5%, Acros)
and Rh(NO3)3·6H2O (p.a., Alfa
Aesar) to the water–ethanol solution of NiCl2·6H2O and AlCl3·6H2O. The molar ratios
between the metals and the residual components (EtOH, H2O, PO, and PEO) were maintained.

Synthesis
The
applied synthesis protocol represents
a modified version of the epoxide-mediated sol–gel route developed
by Tokudome et al.37 AlCl3·6H2O, MCl2·6H2O (M = Ni, Co), and
PEO were dissolved in a water–ethanol mixture and stirred thoroughly.
The solution was cooled below room temperature. Afterward, PO was
added quickly and stirred vigorously under cooled conditions for several
minutes. In the next step, the mixture was stirred at room temperature
for a certain period of time and finally transferred to a water bath.
Gelation and gel aging took place at 313 K for 24 h. The obtained
gel bodies were washed with ethanol and air-dried at 323 K for 7 days.
Finally, the dried monoliths were calcined under an air atmosphere
in a muffle furnace (Nabertherm N7/H) for 12 h at 1223 K (Ni–Al
system) and 1323 K (Co–Al system) separately at a heating rate
of 5 K·min–1 to obtain the hierarchically structured
spinel-containing alumina network.

Characterization
SEM images were obtained using a DSM
940 and LEO GEMINI 1530 (Zeiss Germany) microscope. The samples were
placed on a carbon conductor, and a layer of gold was deposited on
them.

EDX was utilized to examine the homogeneous distribution
of the different metals in the samples. For this procedure, the samples
were embedded in epoxide resin (G1-GATAN), ground, and polished using
an alumina suspension (Buehler, MasterPrep Polishing Suspension).
Furthermore, the samples were etched using an argon ion beam. The
samples were covered with carbon via the vapor deposition process
to avoid charging effects during the experiments.

Mercury porosimetry
was used to examine the pore morphology, especially
the pore diameter and the pore volume. Prior to the measurements,
the samples were activated at 393 K for 24 h. The characterization
was conducted using a PASCAL 440 porosimeter (Fisher Scientific) with
a maximum pressure of 400 kPa. A contact angle of mercury of 141.3°
was applied, and the surface tension of mercury was set at 0.484 N·m–1.

Nitrogen sorption (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics)
was used to determine
the specific surface area (ABET), pore
volume, and pore diameter, primarily for the mesopores generated during
the sol–gel process. Prior to the examination, the samples
were dried and activated at 523 K under ultrahigh vacuum. The determination
of the specific surface area was conducted using the linearized form
of the BET equation in the range of 0.05 ≤ p/p0 ≤ 0.30. The determination
of the pore volume was carried out at a relative pressure p/p0 of 0.99.

The crystal
structures of the samples were examined using an X-ray
powder diffractometer (BRUKER D8 DISCOVER, Bruker). The samples were
homogenized via ground milling. To examine the transition metal species,
UV–vis spectroscopy (LAMBDA 650S, PerkinElmer) was used.

The resulting composition of the samples was characterized by ICP-OES.
Prior to the examination on an OPTIMA 8000 system (PerkinElmer), the
samples were solubilized in a solution of nitric, hydrochloric, sulfuric,
and phosphoric acid using a microwave reactor for 100 min.

Catalytic
Experiments
Selected materials were studied
as catalysts in the DRM with CO2. Experiments were performed
using a cylindrical fixed-bed reactor made from quartz glass at an
ambient pressure. The reactor was filled with 100 mg of the catalyst
(ABET > 150 m2·g–1, particle size between 500 and 1000 μm) and
diluted with α-Al2O3 (Elektroschmelze
Zschornewitz) to a volume of
1 cm3. The catalysts were reduced using a gas flow (100
mL·min–1) of 5 vol % H2 in argon,
while heating the reactor at the rate of 10 K·min–1 to the reduction temperature of 1023 K, which was then held for
1 h. The catalytic reaction took place under isothermal conditions
at temperatures of 1023, 1073, and 1123 K for 15 h with a feed gas
flow of 100 mL·min–1 (GHSV = 6000 h–1) consisting of 47.5 vol % CH4, 47.5 vol % CO2, and 5.0 vol % Ar. The concentrations of CH4, CO2, and CO in the product gas flow were continuously analyzed
using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (URAS26, ABB
Instruments). Gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu) was applied to
determine the amount of hydrogen formed. The water amount was determined
using a dew point hygrometer (Optidew Vision, Michell Instruments).

After 15 h TOS, the reactor was flushed with argon before the deposited
carbon residues were removed via thermal treatment in an air flow
(10 mL·min–1) at 1123 K for 2 h. During carbon
removal, the emerging gases were analyzed via FTIR for carbon quantification,
assuming that the elemental carbon is oxidatively converted to CO
and CO2 only. The C-selectivity (Csel) is defined
as the amount of carbon relative to the carbon converted from CH4 after 15 h on-stream. The experimental error for the conversions
of CH4 and CO2 and nH2/nCO was ≤ 3% and
that of the C-selectivity (Csel) was ≤ 10%.
