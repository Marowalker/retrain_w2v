Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)
and perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA) are two perfluoroalkyl substances that have been shown to result
in several adverse health effects, including birth defects, kidney/testicular
cancer, as well as liver and thyroid damage. The surfactant nature
of PFOS and PFOA in water makes these compounds extremely difficult
to remove from drinking water. In this paper, an efficient method
to remove PFOS and PFOA from drinking water using linear fluorinated
silane-functionalized aluminum oxide hydroxide (γ-AlOOH) nanowhiskers
was developed. Filters functionalized with linear fluorinated silanes
containing 13–17 fluorine atoms were able to remove >90%
of
the PFOS/PFOA at a very high flux of 1223 L/m2·h.
However, due to the hydrophobicity of these linear fluorinated silanes,
high pressure drop was also noted across the membrane thickness during
the filtration process. To reduce the back-pressure drop, linear fluorinated
silanes with appended hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) units were
synthesized, and it was further demonstrated that the new hydrophilic
linear fluorinated silane dramatically reduced the pressure drop of
the γ-AlOOH filter while maintaining 99.9% PFOS and PFOA reduction.
Adsorption tests were performed to understand the removal mechanism.

Introduction
Clean water is a vital resource for life.
This need has been realized
since ancient times where civilizations would emerge and settle near
sources of clean water. With the growth of industrial, materials,
and agrochemical production, the contamination of aquatic sources
is becoming more prevalent worldwide. Many contaminants have been
reported in water, including pesticides, heavy metals, biological
species, pharmaceutical residues, and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).1−6 In particular, PFAS (formerly known as perfluorochemicals) have
emerged as an increasingly common contaminant in drinking water that
are very difficult to remove and persist in the environment.7,8

PFAS are synthetic compounds with multiple C–F bonds
that
are used in industrial processes for the preparation of fire-resistant
foams, protective coatings, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) products.
Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
are two eight-carbon PFAS that are widely observed in water supplies
(Figure 1).7 Both PFOS and PFOA are employed for a wide range
of applications, including aqueous film-forming foams for firefighting,
nonstick cookware, and water-resistant coatings for carpets, leather,
and furniture. Due to the long human body accumulation times for PFOS
(5.4 years) and PFOA (3.8 years),8 both
chemicals have been linked to obesity, cancer, hormone disruption,
and high cholesterol levels.9

Figure 1 Structures
of PFOS and PFOA.

PFOS and PFOA are typically
introduced into the environment from
the waste streams of industrial, military, or urban regions. The current
state-of-the-art techniques for PFAS removal are adsorption on porous
media, membrane filtration, or chemical degradation.9−19 Adsorption on highly porous-activated carbon is the most commonly
used method today; however, this approach is both nonselective for
PFAS and expensive to implement, which limits its application for
large-scale filtration.20

Previously,
we developed a cost-effective technology for removing
heavy metal ions from drinking water using a thiol-functionalized
porous aluminum oxide hydroxide (γ-AlOOH) filter media.21−23 In this work, we utilized the same γ-AlOOH filtration media
and investigated the feasibility of fluorinated surface functionalization
for PFOS and PFOA removal from contaminated water. The γ-AlOOH
substrate was chosen due to its high specific surface area as well
as its unique surface characteristics upon contact with water.24 That is, in aqueous solutions, the aluminol
group on γ-AlOOH leads to the formation of (Al(OH))2+. As a result, γ-AlOOH carries a high level of positive charge
and is commonly used to sequester negatively charged microbes from
water.25,26 Thus, our ultimate goal is to develop a
multifunctional filtration media that can simultaneously remove toxic
heavy metal ions, biological species, and PFOS/PFOA from drinking
water.

Results and Discussion
Our initial approach for the
removal of PFOA and PFOS was based
on the hypothesis that the perfluorinated side chains would have a
favorable fluorophilic C–F···F–C interaction
and adsorb onto a surface functionalized with perfluorinated chains
(Figure 2). Using commercial
perfluorinated silanes, 4603 filters were functionalized and tested
for the removal of PFOA and PFOS. The silanes utilized to functionalize
the 4603 filters were (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl) trimethoxysilane
(F13), (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl) trimethoxysilane
(F17), and (perfluoro(polypropyleneoxy))methyoxypropyl trimethoxysilane
(F133–283) (Figure 3). Several functionalization conditions for the functionalization
of 4603 filters with fluorinated silanes include solvents, temperatures,
and reaction times. We found that using previously optimized functionalization
conditions (95% EtOH, cat. AcOH)23 resulted
in filters that performed poorly on these substrates, presumably due
to the aggregation of the silanes in solution, which prevented efficient
functionalization of the substrate. As perfluorinated compounds are
often soluble in fluorinated solvents, we tested trifluoroethanol,
trifluorotoluene (TFT), and Novec 7700 for filter conjugation. We
found that using TFT as the solvent yielded filters with the highest
removal of PFOA and PFOS. Functionalization using Novec 7700 yielded
filters with the second best removal.

substrate.

Figure 3 Structures of commercial fluorinated silanes.

A silane concentration screen
of the F17-functionalized filters
was tested under dynamic filtration conditions at silane concentrations
of 0.1, 0.5, and 1%, and the results are shown in Table 1. PFAS removal improved with
increasing silane concentration but also resulted in a large pressure
drop. This is most likely due to the increased hydrophobicity of the
filters. These fluorinated silane-modified filters performed better
than a filter loaded with a cake layer of granular activated carbon
(GAC) Filtrasorb 300. Compared to the F13 silanized filter, the F17
silanized filter displayed almost quantitative removal at a similar
silane loading. Note that the higher performance of the fluorinated
silane-modified filters in this test may have been due to faster kinetics
rather than higher capacity since the empty bed contact time of 1
s is less than the typical GAC empty bed contact time for PFAS (>10
min).27

Encouraged by our initial data using commercial silanes,
we focused
on improving the filter performance by reducing the back pressure
under increased flux. The highly fluorinated surface produced high
back pressure and prevented efficient filtration. It was hypothesized
that a silane containing a polar poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) terminus
and a perfluorinated region would effectively reduce any associated
pressure drop while maintaining the effective removal of PFAS. The
structure of this amphiphilic silane is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Structure of amphiphilic
silane.

A series of silanes with varied
perfluorinated chains were prepared
according to Scheme 1. The MPEG-4-OH (2) was activated using tosyl chloride.28 The diol (4a–c) was deprotonated
using sodium hydride and alkylated with the tosylate (3) to provide alcohol (5a–c) in modest
yields. Alcohols 5a–c were activated as the triflate
using trifluoromethane sulfonyl chloride and displaced with 3-aminopropyl
trimethoxysilane at 50 °C to give the desired products (1a–c) in good yields. Analogs were prepared with 4-,
6-, and 8-perfluorinated carbons giving 8, 12, and 16 fluorines, respectively.
Compounds 1a−1c were used directly
for the filter conjugation reaction without further purification.
Interestingly, these products were soluble under our initial conjugation
conditions (95% EtOH, cat. AcOH) and did not require the use of fluorinated
solvents.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of PEG-4-Fluorosilanes
Gratifyingly, the PEG-substituted fluorosilanes
proved highly effective
in removing PFOA and PFOS with no increase in pressure drop (Table 2). Overall, the PEG
silanes with fluorination lengths of F8–F16 were highly effective
in removing PFOS/PFOA with the F16–PEG silane (1c) performing the best overall.

Batch-Mode Adsorption for PFOA and PFOS
A static batch-mode
adsorption experiment was performed at 25 °C with PFOA and PFOS
challenge solutions and the 4603 control, F17-functionalized 4603,
and 1c-functionalized 4603 (F16–4PEG), using a
challenge solution with 15 000 ppt PFOS and 8800 ppt of PFOA.
The total time of the experiment was controlled to be 48 h. The results
are shown in Table 3. Functionalization with silane 1c resulted in the highest
adsorption of PFOA under the batch-mode conditions, and the F17 had
the highest adsorption of PFOS with almost complete removal from the
challenge solution. The high adsorption capacity of PFOS is believed
to be due to the extra fluorine atoms, which can lead to more fluorine–fluorine
interactions, and the results are consistent with our molecular dynamic
(MD) simulation. Preliminary data suggests that adsorbed PFOS and
PFOA do not leach out of used filters when flushed with deionized
water; however, more experimentation is needed to confirm this result.
The MD simulation, as well as the leaching of the adsorbed PFAS on
the membrane, will be reported in future reports.

Conclusions
Filters
functionalized with commercial fluorinated silanes proved
highly effective at removing PFAS contaminants from the challenge
water, however, resulting in a large pressure drop. To improve the
performance of these filters, a series of modified amphiphilic silanes
were synthesized and evaluated under dynamic and static filtration
conditions. Gratifyingly, these silanes provided excellent PFAS removal
with no increased pressure drop. The amphiphilic silanes have a high
capacity for PFAS removal under static adsorption conditions. Evaluation
of these filters under realistic water conditions is currently underway.

Experimental
Section
Materials
A commercial γ-AlOOH filtration media
4603 was provided by Ahlstrom Filtration LLC (Mt Holly Springs, PA).
The filter media was used without further pretreatment. Oxygen plasma
treatment was accomplished using a Harrick Plasma Cleaner PDC-001.
Commercial perfluorosilanes and 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane were
obtained from Gelest Inc. (Morrisville, PA) and used in the as-received
form. PFOS, PFOA, trifluorotoluene, Novec 7100, and ethanol were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used without any further purification.
Reagents for synthesis were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Oakwood
Chemicals and used as received. Anhydrous solvents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Filtrasorb 300 granular activated carbon was obtained
from Calgon Carbon Corporation (Moon Township, PA).

Surface Functionalization
Two functionalization procedures
were developed for filter functionalization. All silane functionalization
reactions were performed in plastic containers.

Fluorinated Silane Functionalization
The base filter
is 4603, which consists of γ-AlOOH nanowhiskers sintered onto
fiberglass and forming a nonwoven filter. The effective pore size
in these filters is around 1 μm. All filters were subjected
to an oxygen plasma treatment for 20 min. The filters were then placed
in a 1% (v/v) solution of silane in trifluorotoluene with 0.1% (v/v)
acetic acid and placed on a shaker table for 24 h (150 rpm). The filters
were collected by vacuum filtration, washed with trifluorotoluene
and isopropanol, and dried under vacuum.

PEG-Fluorinated Silane
Functionalization
The 4603 filters
were subjected to an oxygen plasma treatment for 20 min. The filters
were then placed in a 1% (v/v) solution of silane in 95% ethanol with
0.1% (v/v) acetic acid and placed on a shaker table for 24 h (150
rpm). The filters were collected by vacuum filtration, washed with
ethanol, and dried under vacuum.

Water Filtration Tests
Artificial water solutions containing
PFOS and PFOA were prepared with deionized water spiked with a target
860 ppt of PFOS and 390 ppt of PFOA according to the NSF method 53.
The pH of the water was controlled to be around 7.5. Two types of
filtration testings were performed: (a) dynamic filtration test: a
previously developed set was used for this study.23 Briefly, a filter with a diameter of 25 mm, a thickness
of 0.67 mm, and an average weight of 120 mg was encapsulated inside
a 25 mm filter holder made of polycarbonate. A flux of 1223 L/m2·h was selected using the recommended flow rate based
on NSF protocol P248 (Military Operations Microbiological Water Purifiers)
as well as NSF P473-2016 (drinking water treatment units, PFOA and
PFOS). Prior to collecting the sample, the filter was flushed with
the challenge water for 100 mL, and then a total of 200 mL sample
was collected. The total filtration time was around 30 min. To avoid
any cross-contamination, all testing tubing was fluorine-free. (b)
Batch-mode filtration test: this test was performed by soaking three
filters (the same size as used in the dynamic filtration process)
in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 15 000 ppt PFOS and 8800 ppt
PFOA in deionized water. The flask was then placed on a shaker table
for 48 h operated at 200 rpm at room temperature. After the desired
duration, the concentration of PFOS and PFOA of the water was then
analyzed and the adsorption capacity was then calculated.

For
relative comparison, the GAC was ground to less than 250 μm
in particle size to fit inside the polycarbonate filter holder. Approximately
60 mg of F400 was supported onto the 4603 base membrane for the dynamic
state testing. The empty bed contact time was around 1 s using the
empty bed divided by the flow rate of 10 mL/min. The bed volume after
the sample collected was around 0.16 mL.

PFOS and PFOA Testing
FFOS and PFOA were analyzed using
solid phase extraction (SPE) and LC/MS/MS according to the EPA method
537 version 1.1 (2009). Briefly, the C13 labeled analogs of the target
compounds were added to the sample container. The container was agitated,
and then the contents of the container (water sample) were passed
through a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge with a weak anion
exchange (WAX) sorbent. Once the PFAS compounds were adsorbed onto
the WAX cartridge, the cartridge was eluted with the solvent and the
solvent solution was reduced in volume. An aliquot of the final volume
was then injected onto an LC/MS/MS operated in electrospray ionization,
negative ion mode. Target analytes were then quantified off of a primary
transition ion used to generate a calibration curve of relative response
(target/isotope) versus concentration. The minimum reporting levels
(MRLs) for PFOS and PFOA are 0.4 and 0.2 ppt, respectively.

Synthesis
of PEG Silanes
Compounds 3, 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b were
prepared according to literature procedures.28 Briefly, a solution of tetraethyleneglycol monomethyl ether (10.0
g, 48.0 mmol) and triethylamine (6.8 mL, 48.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) was treated with p-toluenesulfonyl
chloride (8.70 g, 45.6 mmol) portionwise at 20 °C under nitrogen.
The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at 20 °C.
The reaction was diluted with water (200 mL), and the aqueous layer
was extracted with CH2Cl2 (150 mL × 2).
The combined organic fractions were dried (MgSO4) and concentrated
under reduced pressure to yield tosylate 3 (15.2 g, 41.9
mmol, 87%) as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz; CDCl3): δ 7.80 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 2H), 7.34

General Procedure for the
Alkylation of Fluorinated Diols 4a–c with 3 To Give 5a–c
A solution of diol 4a–c (14.5 mmol) in dry dioxane (50 mL)
was treated with sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 10.4
mmol) under nitrogen, stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and
warmed to 90 °C for 2 h. A solution of tosylate 3 (6.90 mmol) in dry dioxane (19 mL) was added dropwise and the mixture
was stirred at 90 °C overnight. The reaction was cooled down
to room temperature and quenched with 1 M HCl (2 mL), and the solvent
was removed under reduced pressure. The crude compound was dissolved
in dichloromethane (200 mL), and a white precipitate was removed via
filtration. After solvent removal, the crude product was purified
by chromatography on SiO2 (2:1 ethyl acetate/hexanes) to
yield 5a–c as the monosubstituted alcohols.

−123.5 (s), −122.4, −122.0, −119.8.

General Procedure for Triflation and Aminolysis of Alcohols 5a–c To Give Silanes 1a–c
A solution of PEG-fluorinated alcohol 5a–c (2.41 mmol) in dry THF (5 mL) was cooled to 0 °C and treated
with trifluoromethane sulfonyl chloride (4.83 mmol) followed by triethylamine
(6.03 mmol) under a N2 atmosphere. The reaction was stirred
for 30 min at 0 °C and allowed to warm to room temperature overnight,
diluted with EtOAc, and washed with water. The organic extract was
dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to give
the crude product. The crude product was purified by chromatography
on SiO2 (1:1 to 4:1 ethyl acetate/hexanes) to give the
intermediate triflate as a tan, oily liquid. The intermediate triflate
(2.41 mmol) was dissolved in 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane (7.25
mmol) and heated to 50 °C overnight. The reaction was concentrated
to a viscous oil, and silanes 1a–c were carried on directly for the functionalization of the membranes.
