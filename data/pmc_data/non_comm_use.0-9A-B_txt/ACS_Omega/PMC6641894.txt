A single-stranded
DNA-based (ssDNA) dyad was constructed comprising
15 silver atoms stabilized by a ssDNA scaffold (DNA-AgNC) and an Alexa
546 fluorophore bound to the 5′ end. The Alexa 546 was chosen
to function as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor
for the AgNC. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments
allowed unraveling the excited-state relaxation processes of the purified
DNA-AgNC-only system. The TCSPC results revealed slow relaxation dynamics
and a red shift of the emission spectrum during the excited-state
lifetime. The results from the model systems were needed to understand
the more complicated decay pathways present in the collected high-performance
liquid chromatography fraction, which contained the dyad (37% of the
emissive population). In the dyad system, the FRET efficiency between
donor and acceptor was determined to be 94% using TCSPC, yielding
a center-to-center distance of 4.6 nm. To date, only limited structural
information on DNA-AgNCs is available and the use of TCSPC and FRET
can provide information on the center-to-center distance between chromophores
and provide positional information in nanostructures composed of AgNCs.

Introduction
DNA-stabilized fluorescent
silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) are a relatively
new class of emitters that have found applications in sensing and
fluorescence imaging.1−8 Unlike larger silver nanoparticles that are characterized by plasmon
absorption bands, these AgNCs consist of a limited number of atoms
(usually below 25 atoms)9 and display emission
throughout the visible and near-infrared (NIR) parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum.10−13 The emission can be tuned by changing the stabilizing scaffold.14−17 Progress has been made in the preparation and study of DNA-stabilized
AgNCs by purifying the as-synthesized samples using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC).11,18−20 This opens up the possibility to use DNA not only as the scaffold
that stabilizes the fluorescent AgNC, but also to integrate the emitters
at specific positions in nanoscale DNA assemblies.21,22 HPLC-purified samples, combined with mass spectrometry, allows linking
the amount of silver atoms attached to the DNA to the spectral properties,
and X-ray based techniques can provide further structural details.11,20,23−28 Despite the boom in AgNC-fluorescence-based applications, fundamental
studies that investigate the individual spectral properties of the
purified emitters are limited. Even more limited are studies on the
interaction with other classic organic fluorophores (e.g., as a Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair).21,29 FRET pairs
have been used to study protein structure and provide positional information.30 By constructing a dye–AgNC FRET pair
with a controlled position of the dye, positional information on the
AgNC could be unraveled, providing valuable information in the field
of DNA-AgNCs until full structural elucidation by X-ray techniques
is available. In this article, we study the spectroscopic properties
of a red-emitting AgNC that was purified by HPLC and investigate the
effect of the presence of an organic fluorophore (Alexa 546) linked
to the 5′ end of the DNA scaffold (5′-CACCGCTTTTGCCTTTTGGGGACGGATA-3′).
The latter creates a DNA-based FRET pair with Alexa 546 as the donor
and the AgNC as the acceptor, which we will refer to as the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC
dyad (see Scheme 1).
An AgNC encapsulated in the same DNA sequence with an additional TTTT
linking sequence and a rhodamine attached to the 3′ end was
previously studied by Gwinn et al.21 Their
deduced value of R0 = 7.2 nm together
with FRET efficiency ≥67% implies a dye–cluster distance
of ≤6.4 nm. Because these values were based on intensity measurements
and not from time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements,
it can only provide a lower limit estimate for the FRET efficiency
because the presence of a donor-only fraction cannot be excluded.
We demonstrate that the use of TCSPC allows discriminating the dyad
from the donor-only fraction and calculating the true FRET efficiency
of the dyad. Our study with Alexa 546 at the 5′ end provides
additional information that can help to ultimately pin down the position
of the AgNC in the DNA strand. The goal here is to determine the FRET
efficiency of the pure dyad and hence determine the center-to-center
distance between the donor and acceptor using Förster’s
point dipole approximation.31 The latter
has so far not been done experimentally and will provide important
information regarding future nanoscale assemblies using AgNCs and
in determining the actual position of the AgNC in the stabilizing
DNA scaffold. To fully disentangle the photophysical properties of
the dyad, we first investigate the two subsystems individually. These
two model systems are DNA-Alexa546 and DNA-AgNC (see Scheme 1). Particularly, the understanding
of the TCSPC behavior of the AgNC fluorescence was found to be important.
The solvatochromism of DNA-AgNCs has been discussed recently in the
literature together with the potential use of the fluorescence sensing
in DNA studies.32−34 It has been shown (and in particular for this sequence
of DNA) that nonspecific solvent interaction models are not applicable
to DNA-AgNCs. Instead, solvent-induced structural changes and/or dielectric
changes in the local vicinity of the clusters have been proposed as
plausible explanations.34 Furthermore,
the refractive index sensitivity of these DNA-AgNCs tested in glycerol/water
mixtures was suggested to reflect local dielectric variations.32 Additionally, time-dependent spectral shifts
on the nanosecond time scale have been studied via time-resolved emission
spectra (TRES) by Hsu et al., suggesting solvation dynamics near the
DNA bases.33 The later was done however
on as-synthesized samples without purification. Besides these relaxations
on the pico- and nanosecond time scales, the ultrafast relaxation
from the absorptive state to the emissive state of NIR-emitting DNA-AgNCs
was shown to occur within 140 fs.35 The
characterization of the relaxation dynamics and the interpretation
of the TCSPC data will help future studies and the use of DNA-AgNCs
in FRET applications.

Results and Discussion
DNA-Alexa546
We start our investigation by looking
at the steady-state and time-resolved photophysical properties of
Alexa 546 linked to the DNA sequence that will later be used to stabilize
the AgNC in the dyad system (see Scheme 1). The absorption and emission spectra of
DNA-Alexa546 can be found in Figure 1A. DNA-Alexa546 has an absorption maximum at 555 nm
and an emission maximum at 571 nm in 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer
(NH4OAc). These values are similar to the values provided
by the manufacturer of Alexa 546 (556 and 573 nm, respectively).36 A two-dimensional (2D) excitation versus emission
plot of DNA-Alexa546 can be found in Figure S1. The fluorescence quantum yield of DNA-Alexa546 was measured to
be 0.84 using Rhodamine 6G in absolute ethanol (fluorescence quantum
yield = 0.95) as a reference.37−39 This value is also similar to
the value of the succinimidyl ester derivative in aqueous solution
reported by the manufacturer (0.79).40 TCSPC
experiments show that the fluorescence decay curve of DNA-Alexa546
excited at 507 nm and detected at 570 nm can be best fitted with a
biexponential model (see Figure 1B). Fractional intensities of 99% (3.87 ± 0.01
ns decay component) and 1% (1.37 ± 0.48 ns decay component) were
found, indicating that the fluorescence can be considered to be mainly
coming from one emissive species with a decay time of 3.87 ns, which
is similar to the decay time of 4.1 ns reported by the manufacturer.40 Analyzing decay curves over the whole Alexa
546 emission range allows constructing TRES. The TRES in Figure S2 shows no shift on time scales slower
than the instrument response function (IRF). The steady-state and
time-resolved experiments on DNA-Alexa546 show that the fluorophore
behaves as expected and no unwanted quenching or spectral changes
occurred upon conjugation to the DNA. During the cluster formation
process in the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad, NaBH4 is used for
reduction of the silver cations. We tested whether addition of NaBH4 to DNA-Alexa546 has an effect on the chemical stability of
the fluorophore. Figure S3 shows that addition
of similar amounts of NaBH4 used for the reduction of the
silver cations has a neglectable effect on the UV–vis absorption
spectrum of DNA-Alexa546.

was fitted with a biexponential decay model (red curve). The green
curve is the IRF. The biexponential model had a reduced χ2 of the fit of 0.899.

DNA-AgNC
In a next step, we studied the photophysical
properties of the DNA-AgNC in detail. The sequence was investigated
previously and has been reported to stabilize 15 Ag atoms.21,22,26,27,32,34,41 After synthesis, the DNA-AgNC sample was purified
by HPLC. For this, the fraction
around 7.7 min that shows absorption at 600 nm (see Figure S4) was collected. Figure 2A shows the absorption, excitation, and emission
spectra of DNA-AgNC. The absorption maximum is at 603 nm, whereas
the emission maximum is at 672 nm. Recording an excitation spectrum
monitoring the emission at 700 nm reveals that most of the features
of the absorption spectrum can be found in the excitation spectrum
as well. The main difference is the peak around 510 nm (indicated
by a blue arrow), which is absent in the excitation spectrum, indicating
that this absorption feature is not related to the emissive AgNC with
a maximum at 672 nm. Additionally, the absorption spectrum has a broader
tail in the 650–700 nm region. The latter indicates that besides
the main emissive species at 600 nm, even after HPLC purification,
a number of additional absorbing species are present, both blue- and
red-shifted. Upon closer investigation of the absorption spectra recorded
during HPLC purification, it can be seen that these additional species
are more pronounced in the tail of the peak of the fraction collected
around 7.7 min compared to the maximum (see Figure S5). Figure S5 indicates that it
is possible to increase the purity by avoiding the tail fraction.
However, Figure 2B
shows that the purified DNA-AgNC fraction can still be described as
mainly one single emitter and that these other absorbing species do
not contribute significantly to the fluorescence. Additionally, photobleaching
experiments show that even if one collects a single pure fraction,
this fraction can be photoconverted into the other species (see Figure S6). The fluorescence quantum yield of
the AgNC with an emission maximum at 672 nm was measured to be 0.68
using cresyl violet in ethanol as a reference.37,39,42 This is in good agreement with the value
of 0.75 reported by the group of Gwinn et al.21,26 Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to estimate
the molar extinction coefficient of the DNA-AgNC.43 A value of 1.5E5 M–1 cm–1 was found using Atto633 as a reference dye for volume estimation
(see Figure S7). Although this value, determined
by FCS, should be considered an estimate, it matches well with the
estimate provided by Gwinn et al. of 1.4E5 M–1 cm–1, which was based on purity estimation and comparison
to the estimated DNA molar extinction coefficient.21,44,45

561 nm) spectra of the DNA-AgNC. The blue arrow indicates the absorption
feature that is not present in the excitation spectrum. (B) Two-dimensional
excitation vs emission plot of the DNA-AgNC.

After having analyzed the steady-state properties, we performed
TCSPC experiments on the DNA-AgNC sample. Despite the fact that steady-state
2D plot indicates a single emitter, the fluorescence decay curves
when excited at 561 nm do not fit satisfactory to a monoexponential
decay model. At least a triexponential model is needed to get a satisfactory
global fit of decay curves at different emission wavelengths. Figure S8 shows the decay-associated spectra
(DAS) of the three decay components. A dominant component of 3.95
ns is present that has DAS similar to the steady-state spectrum. The
two additional decay components have DAS with blue-shifted maxima
and positive amplitudes at short wavelengths and negative amplitudes
at long wavelengths. The DAS in Figure S8 represent the typical signature of a time-dependent relaxation during
the excited-state decay.46−48 As a result of the relatively
slow relaxation, the emission red-shifts during the time that it takes
for the AgNCs to decay back to the ground state. To illustrate this
point better, the same data can be plotted in TRES form. Figure 3A shows the TRES
at different points in time after excitation. A clear red shift can
be observed as indicated by the black arrow. This phenomenon can also
be clearly seen in the average decay time spectrum49 and results in an increase in the average decay time with
increasing emission wavelength (see Figure 3B). So, despite the apparent complicated
multiexponential decay behavior, the system can be satisfactorily
described as one emissive species that displays excited-state relaxation
and hence red-shifts on the time scale of the fluorescence decay time.
A similar behavior was also reported by Hsu et al. for a green-emissive
AgNC.33 To investigate this relaxation
in more detail, we fitted the TRES data points with a Gaussian function
and plotted the evolution of the emission maximum as a function of
time. The latter can be seen in Figures S9 and S10. The shift in the position of the emission maximum can
be satisfactory fitted by a biexponential decay model with time constants
of 0.2 and 4.1 ns. The similarity to the results reported by Hsu et
al. could indicate that this is a universal feature of the DNA-stabilized
AgNC, potentially linked to relaxation dynamics of the DNA scaffold.50,51 It is also interesting to point out that Andreatta et al. showed
that for a Coumarin chromophore that was embedded in the DNA structure,
the solvation dynamics stretched well into the nanosecond range, whereas
for the same chromophore, this was done in 10 ps in pure water.50 We found a time-dependent Stokes shift of ca.
160 cm–1, which is shorter than the value of ca.
700 cm–1 in water found by Hsu et al. The latter
could be due to the different DNA sequence used and to the higher
purity of our sample. Experiments on purified samples would minimize
the contribution of multiple species to the energy shift. Further
detailed TCSPC experiments changing temperature or viscosity of the
solvent could provide valuable insight.

DNA-Alexa546-AgNC Dyad
Now that the Alexa 546 donor
and AgNC acceptor have been photophysically characterized, we synthesized
the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad. Details of the synthesis can be found
in the Materials and Methods section. After
HPLC purification, the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad was retrieved, but the
sample still contained other components (see Figure S11, the broad 555 nm absorption with a peak maximum at 13
min is also present at 10 min, where the dyad fraction that absorbs
at 625 nm is collected). Figure S12 shows
the absorption spectra at 10 and 13 min elution times, where the spectral
feature of the dyad can be seen at 10 min. The fraction eluting at
13 min contained the spectral features of DNA and Alexa546 and most
likely has a number of silver atoms bound to the DNA (however nonemissive
and without significant absorption features in the visible range)
because the elution time is different from that of the DNA-Alexa546
starting compound without silver (see Figure S13). Figure 4A shows
the absorption, emission, and excitation spectra of the collected
DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad fraction. The absorption spectrum (black curve)
shows the presence of the two absorption features of Alexa 546 and
the AgNC with maxima at 555 and 603 nm, respectively. The excitation
spectrum (green curve), monitoring predominantly the AgNC emission
at 710 nm, also indicates that there is energy transfer from Alexa
546 to the AgNC. The emission spectrum (red curve), exciting predominantly
Alexa 546 at 510 nm, also indicates energy transfer because significant
emission from the AgNC is present. The presence of the energy transfer
can also be seen in the 2D plot in Figure 4B, where excitation of the donor at 560 nm
leads to significant emission of the AgNCs at 670 nm. The choice of
Alexa 546 gives a less congested 2D excitation versus emission map
due to the lower overlap between donor emission and acceptor emission
compared to the rhodamine used in a previous study.21 Similar to what we observed for the pure DNA-AgNC, exposure
to light leads to a reduction of the AgNC emission at 670 nm in the
dyad system (see Figure S14). A 2D plot
like Figure 4B can
show the presence of FRET but cannot be used to determine the efficiency
because one cannot exclude the presence of a donor-only fraction and
an acceptor-only fraction (the latter is unlikely as Figure S13 indicates that there is no significant amount of
DNA without Alexa 546).21

Figure 4 (A) Absorption (black

and emission (red curve, right Y axis, excited at
510 nm) spectra of the dyad. (B) Two-dimensional excitation vs emission
plot of the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad.

We therefore performed TCSPC experiments, exciting the Alexa
546
at 507 nm (at this wavelength, there is very little direct excitation
of the acceptor; see green curve in Figure 2A and Supporting Information). The TCSPC data for the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad fraction could be
best fitted with a triexponential model. The DAS of the three components
can be found in Figure 5A. Of the three decay components, two were globally linked, whereas
one decay component, tau 1, was kept variable. The evolution of tau
1 as a function of emission wavelength can be seen in Figure 5B. As discussed in the previous
sections, the decay time of Alexa 546 is 3.87 ns and that of the DNA-AgNC
is wavelength dependent, roughly between 3.2 and 4 ns. Because the
fluorescence lifetimes of the donor and the acceptor are so similar
and thus very hard to separate in a data fit, we took the approach
not to link tau1 globally so that this decay term could represent
both the decay of the Alexa 546 in the absence of a FRET acceptor
and the AgNC emission. Linking tau 1 globally gives unsatisfactory
fits, so does a four exponential globally linked fit. The latter is
due to the changing decay time of the AgNC emission as a function
of wavelength and the similarity in the decay times of Alexa 546 and
AgNC. However, the model that we used here represents the fluorescence
decay behavior of the dyad system well. In the wavelength range of
540–610 nm, tau 1 is fairly constant around 3.82 ns, representing
predominantly the Alexa 546 donor-only decay. This must come from a fraction of DNA-Alexa546 that has silver atoms
bound to it but did not form a cluster that is able to quench the
emission of the Alexa 546 fluorophore. Figure S13 indicates that it is unlikely that we collect the DNA-Alexa546
starting compound at these elution times. From 610 to 720 nm, the
decay time steadily increases as was also observed for the DNA-AgNC
in Figure 3B. For the
last three points from 730 to 750 nm, the decay time drops again slightly.
The reason for this is not clear at the moment. Looking at the DAS,
we can confidently attribute tau 1 to the combination of the decay
of two compounds: one is from an Alexa 546 without an AgNC acceptor
and the other is AgNC emission from a DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad excited
through FRET. The FRET from Alexa 546 to the AgNC is evidenced by
the 0.24 ns decay component, which for the positive amplitude part
has the spectral shape of the Alexa 546 and for the negative amplitude
part has the spectral shape of the DNA-AgNC. The fact that Alexa 546
decays with a time constant of 0.24 ns and the emission of the AgNC
rises/appears with the same time constant proves without any doubt
the presence of the FRET process (see Figure 5A).52 On the basis
of the energy-transfer decay time and the decay time of DNA-Alexa546,
a FRET efficiency of 94% for the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad can be calculated.
Due to the fact that the energy-transfer time is approaching the IRF’s
full width at half-maximum (FWHM), one could also consider it as a
lower limit; however, we used numerical reconvolution analysis of
the decay curves, which can resolve features well below the IRF’s
FWHM.53 The molar extinction coefficient
determined from the FCS can be used to calculate the spectral overlap
between the Alexa 546 donor and the AgNC acceptor. An R0 value of 7.34 nm is found using a κ2 value of 2/3. The value of 2/3 is a good estimate looking at the
anisotropy in the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad in a 95% glycerol solution
at room temperature, where the mobility of the dyad should be severely
limited by the high viscosity of the solvent. Figure S15A shows that a value of 0.06 was found in the donor
excitation region, which is close to 0 and hence the relative orientation
of the donor and acceptor dipoles can be considered close to random.
We note that the random relative orientation of the dipoles is due
to the ensemble averaging of the different orientations and not due
to fast segmental rotation of the donor and acceptor because the anisotropy
is measured in glycerol. Indeed, a value of 0.37 is found in the acceptor
region (close to the maximum value of 0.4 indicating virtually no
depolarization). In water, segmental rotation of the donor and acceptor
would be enabled, justifying even more the use of κ2 = 2/3.46 We note that the long linking
chain between the Alexa 546 chromophore and the DNA strand should
provide conformational flexibility (see Scheme S1). The emission anisotropy, exciting the AgNC in the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC
dyad, is around 0.38 and constant over the emission range (see Figure S15B). On the basis of the efficiency
of energy transfer and the R0 value, we
can estimate the center-to-center distance of the FRET pair.46 This leads to a value of 4.6 nm. Overall, we
can conclude that very efficient energy transfer from Alexa 546 to
the AgNC is present in the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad and that they are
4.6 nm separated from each other. Follow-up FRET experiments increasing
the distance and hence lowering the energy-transfer rate would be
interesting to test the accuracy of our distance determination. The
third decay component in Figure 5A has a decay time of 1.3 ns, and the DAS has the spectral
shape of Alexa 546. This decay time seems to be related to an Alexa
546 chromophore that has a reduced decay time but does not transfer
energy to another emissive state because no negative amplitude is
observed at long wavelengths. The origin of the reduced decay time
is not clear. Two possible explanations can be proposed. One is the
quenching of Alexa 546 by silver ions or nonemissive silver nanoclusters
in the DNA scaffold. Another explanation could be quenching by a specific
DNA base. We noticed that DNA-Alexa546 has a minor fractional intensity
contribution of 1% of a 1.37 ± 0.48 ns decay component. One could
speculate that the binding of silver to DNA could change the conformation
of the DNA and force the Alexa 546 in a position where it is on average
more often in proximity to a quenching DNA base. Previous results
have shown that Alexa 546 is most efficiently quenched by guanine.54 Exciting at 507 nm and looking at the decay
amplitudes at 570 nm, we can determine three decay pathways in the
collected DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad fraction. A proportion of 49% of
the excited Alexa 546 chromophores decay with the normal decay time
around 3.82 ns, indicating that no AgNC acceptor is present, and 37%
of the Alexa 546 chromophores undergo efficient FRET (94% efficiency)
to the AgNC acceptor. The remaining 14% Alexa 546 chromophores decay
with a reduced decay time of 1.3 ns. Despite the presence of a mixture
of compounds in the collected fraction, TCSPC can untangle the components
and determine the efficiency of the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad fraction.

Tau 2 and 3 were globally linked in the fit. The dashed black line
is a guide showing the zero line. (B) Decay time value of tau 1 as
a function of emission wavelength. Tau 1 was not globally linked in

At the moment, we cannot resolve
the degree of folding of the DNA,
but this study opens the possibility of deducing it by pinning down
the center-to-center value with further FRET studies. The most accurate
distance determination would be for a FRET pair with a distance difference
of R0, where the change in energy-transfer
efficiency is most sensitive to the donor acceptor distance.46 For the same DNA-AgNC, this can be achieved
using a different donor dye with a worse spectral overlap. Another
different/complementary approach would be adding a longer rigid linker
with a short flexible end between the same DNA sequence and donor
dye.

Conclusions
In this study, a detailed analysis of the
decay pathways of the
collected DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad fraction after HPLC purification
is presented. For the Alexa546-AgNC dyad, efficient FRET (94% efficiency)
is present and a center-to-center distance between the two chromophores
of 4.6 nm was calculated. This study demonstrates the possibility
of determining the average center-to-center distance between the AgNC
and another fluorophore attached to the DNA. In the future, systematic
variations of the distance between donor and acceptor (by varying
the number of bases in the stabilizing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)),
or changing the donor dye (and thereby the spectral overlap), could
lead to an accurate position determination of the AgNC chromophore
inside the DNA.30 Additionally, we show
that the AgNC emission displays a shift in the emission spectrum on
the time scale of the excited-state decay time. This leads to multiexponential
decay behavior at fixed emission wavelengths and complicated DAS.
However, a simpler picture emerges when the same data are analyzed
using TRES. In this way, the emission spectrum can be seen shifting
and the emission maxima can be fitted with a biexponential shift model
with shift times of 0.2 and 4.1 ns. Further follow-up experiments
changing temperature or viscosity of the solvent could provide insight
into the origin of these relaxation dynamics, which could be related
to the DNA scaffold.33,34,50

Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation
DNA-AgNC and
the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC
dyad were synthesized by mixing hydrated DNA or DNA-Alexa546 (both
from IDT technologies) with AgNO3 (99.9999%, Sigma-Aldrich)
in a solution of 10 mM ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) in nuclease-free
water from IDT technologies. After 15 min, the silver ions were reduced
with 0.5 equiv of NaBH4 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich). The concentration
ratio of ssDNA/AgNO3/NaBH4 (in μM) in
the final mixture was 15:187.5:93.75. The samples were left at room
temperature overnight and were concentrated ∼8× using
spin filtration (Amicon Ultra-2 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-3
membrane) before injection in the HPLC system. After HPLC purification,
all samples were solvent-exchanged by spin filtration into 10 mM NH4OAc before any measurements. HPLC-purified ssDNA with an Alexa
Fluor 546 linked at the 5′ end (NHS ester linking) was purchased
from IDT technologies (see Scheme S1 for
details on the linker structure).

HPLC Purification
HPLC purification was done using
a preparative HPLC system from Agilent Technologies with an Agilent
Technologies 1260 infinity fluorescence detector and a Kinetex C18
column (5 μm, 100 Å, 50 × 4.6 mm2) and
a linear gradient flow of 35 mM triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) in
water/MeOH. For DNA-AgNC (eluting at ∼21% TEAA in MeOH), the
gradient was varied from 15 to 30% TEAA in methanol in 15 min and
fractions were collected using the absorbance signal at 600 nm. For
the DNA-Alexa546-AgNC dyad (eluting at ∼39% TEAA in MeOH), the gradient
was varied from 35 to 50% TEAA in methanol in 30 min and fractions
were collected using the absorbance signal at 625 nm to diminish signal
from Alexa 546. The flow rate was 1.5 mL/min in both cases. All HPLC
gradients were followed by 6 min of washing with 95% TEAA in methanol
to remove any remaining sample from the column.

Steady-State
Absorption and Emission Spectroscopy
All
absorption measurements were carried out on a Lambda1050 instrument
from PerkinElmer using a deuterium lamp for ultraviolet radiation
and a halogen lamp for visible and near-infrared radiation. Steady-state
fluorescence measurements were done either using a FluoTime300 instrument
from PicoQuant with a 507 nm laser or a 561 nm laser as excitation
source or using a QuantaMaster400 from PTI with a xenon arc lamp as
excitation source. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for the
wavelength dependency of the detector system.

Anisotropy Measurements
Steady-state anisotropy measurements
were carried out in a solution of 95% glycerol and 5% 10 mM NH4OAc at room temperature. The polarization of the excitation
light and collected fluorescence was controlled with a set of manual
polarizers in the PTI QuantaMaster400 system.

Time-Correlated Single
Photon Counting
Time-resolved
fluorescence measurements were conducted using the FluoTime300 instrument
from PicoQuant with a 510 nm laser (actual wavelength, 507 nm) or
a 561 nm laser as excitation source. All time-resolved data were analyzed
using FluoFit version 4.6 from PicoQuant.

Fluorescence Correlation
Spectroscopy
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was performed by focusing in
a droplet on a cleaned coverslip on top of a confocal microscope.
The excitation source was 600 nm pulsed light (77 MHz) selected from
a continuum laser (SuperK Extreme EXB-6 with a SuperK SELECT wavelength
selector from NKT Photonics, 290 nW measured on the objective). A
600 nm band-pass filter (Semrock FF01-600/14-25) was used to clean
up excitation light. The laser beam (a round-top-hat-like beam profile
was used) was focused through an Olympus IX71 microscope by the oil
immersion objective (Olympus UPLFLN 100×, 1.3 NA). Scattering
from the excitation source was removed using a dichroic mirror (Semrock
LPD01-633RS) and a long-pass filter (Semrock LP02-633RU-25). The fluorescence
signal was collected through a 100 μm pinhole by an avalanche
photodiode (APD, PerkinElmer CD3226). The signals from the APD were
recorded by an SPC-830 card (Becker & Hickl). Purified DNA-AgNC
solutions were diluted in deionized water to cover a wide range of
concentrations. Atto633 (BioReagent, Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in
deionized water (concentrations ranging between ∼5.7 and ∼0.63
nM) and used as a reference dye for excitation-volume determination.
All of the FCS measurements were performed at room temperature.
