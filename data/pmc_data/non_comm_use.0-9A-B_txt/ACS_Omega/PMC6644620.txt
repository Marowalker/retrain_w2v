Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) contains various bioactive
compounds, with benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) as one of the
major groups. The biosynthetic pathways of two major bioactive BIAs
in this plant, nuciferine and N-nornuciferine, are
still not clear. Therefore, several genes related to BIA biosynthesis
were searched from the lotus database to study the role of key genes
in regulating these pathways. In this study, the expression profiles
of NCS, CNMT, 6OMT, CYP80G2, and WRKY TFs were investigated in mechanically wounded lotus leaves. It was found
that the accumulation of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine
significantly increased in the mechanically wounded lotus leaves in
accordance with the relative expression of putative CYP80G2 and one WRKY transcription factor (NNU_24385), with the coregulation of CNMT. Furthermore, the role of methyltransferase-related genes in this
study suggested that methylation of the isoquinoline nucleus to yield
a methylated-BIA structure may occur at the N position before the
O position. Altogether, this study provides improved understanding
of the genes regulating BIA biosynthesis under stressed conditions,
which could lead to improvements in BIA production from the commercial
lotus.

==== Body
Introduction
The content of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) in plants is known
to be closely related to their pharmaceutical values, such as analgesics,
morphine, and codeine from Papaver somniferum, berberine from Coptis japonica,
and the antibacterial agent sanguinarine from P. somniferum and Eschscholzia californica. Similarly,
lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.), which
contains BIAs, has also been reported to possess interesting biological
activities. For example, nuciferine and N-nornuciferine
from lotus provide antidiabetic agents, anti-HIV agents, and melanogenesis
inhibitory activities.1−3 An
aquatic perennial lotus plant is distributed throughout Asia and Oceania
and is used as a raw material in folk medicine.4 Phytochemically, N. nucifera has been shown to contain several bioactive alkaloids, with the
majority being two aporphine-type BIAs in the leaves: N-nornuciferine and nuciferine.1,2,5 Other BIAs, such as lotusine, liensinine, isoliensinine, and neferine,
have been found in trace amounts in the leaf sap, seed, embryo, and
tender rhizome.6 Biosynthetically, the
pathways leading to the formation of many BIAs in various alkaloid-producing
plant species have been successfully elucidated, with identification
of the corresponding genes for the purpose of pharmaceutical usage;
however, little is known about the biosynthetic pathways of aporphine-type
BIAs in plants, including bioactive nuciferine and N-nornuciferine in lotus.5,7,8 Recently, two aporphine-type BIAs, corytuberine from C. japonica and magnoflorine from Magnolia grandiflora, have had their possible biosynthetic
pathways documented in C. japonica and P. somniferum, respectively.9,10 CYP80-based
reactions have been employed in many steps of simple BIA production.8−11 In
this pathway, CYP80G2 is responsible for hydroxylation and phenol
C–C coupling. It has been reported that CYP80G2 catalyzes the
phenol C–C coupling reaction, by which (S)-reticuline
is converted to (S)-corytuberine.10−12 The presence of aporphine-type BIAs in lotus
suggests that it possibly possesses a CYP80G2 analog that catalyzes
the formation of the aporphine backbone.10,13 In
this study, we predicted that this putative CYP80G2 sequence would
be involved in this reaction. The putative CYP80G2 was then searched for in the lotus database.

In
the literature, apart from their chemical structures, nuciferine and N-nornuciferine biosynthetic pathways have not yet been
reported. It would be interesting and useful for more attention to
be given to their biosynthetic pathways. Thus, we gathered this information,
along with the reported structure of various aporphine-type BIAs from
lotus organs, to draw a proposed biosynthetic pathway of nuciferine
and N-nornuciferine (Figure 1). Generally, the BIA biosynthetic pathway
begins with the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde
catalyzed by norcoclaurine synthase (NCS). Then,
a series of subsequent enzymes, including S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases 6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT), 7-O-methyltransferase
(7OMT), coclaurine-N-methyltransferase (CNMT), and
P450 C–C phenol-coupling enzyme (corytuberine synthase (CTS)
or CYP80G2), probably perform catalytic activity to yield nuciferine
and N-nornuciferine structures.10,11,14

Figure 1 Proposed biosynthetic pathway of nuciferine
and N-nornuciferine. Target genes and products examined
in this study are highlighted in red. (A) Possible biosynthetic pathway
of BIAs in lotus mapped with various related enzymes and reported
BIA structures found in lotus. (B) Possible pathway to nuciferine
and N-nornuciferine synthesis in lotus drawn following
relative gene expression patterns from the mechanical wounding experiment
where CYP80G2 showed the first response to wounding, followed by CNMT
and 6OM.

In addition, BIA-related genes are
regulated by specific WRKY transcription factors (WRKY TFs), which
have multiple functions in response to biotic and abiotic stresses,
such as pathogens, drought, and wounds.15,16 There is evidence
suggesting that wound-induced WRKY TF1 could subsequently regulate
BIA pathways in P. somniferum.17 Similarly, WRKY TF1 from C. japonica has been found to induce the biosynthetic gene expression of berberine,
which results in significant increases in berberine production in
its tissues.15,18 In this study, we isolated and
investigated the expressions of some biosynthetic genes, including NCS, CNMT, 6OMT, and CYP80G2, and the WRKY family of TFs in
response to a mechanical wounding stress, along with quantitative
analyses of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine accumulation
in lotus leaves. Our findings could provide information on the regulation
of key enzymes in BIA biosynthetic pathways and be helpful for developing
lotus varieties with high levels of bioactive BIAs.

Results
Isolation of
Genes Encoding BIA Biosynthetic Enzymes and Transcription Factor
Most of the BIA-related biosynthetic enzymes in lotus, except NCS,
are predicted to be present. Recently, five isoforms of NCS have been
isolated from the lotus genome and found to be related to the total
content of alkaloid in lotus organs,19 and
therefore these were used in this study. Results from amino acid sequence
alignment indicated that the five identified NnNCS shared a conserved
region in the glycine-rich loop (GDTGVGT), which was also shared with
known NCS from other plant species retrieved from GenBank (Figure 2A). Searching for
candidate 6OMT genes in the lotus genome led to the
finding of four genes closely related to the 6OMT of C. japonica (accession no. BAB08004)
(Figure S3). They were isolated from template
sequences of NNU_19035, NNU_03165, NNU_03166, and NNU_23168 presented in the
lotus genome and were hence named as NnOMT35, NnOMT65, NnOMT66, and NnOMT68, respectively. They shared 61, 63, 67, and 69% identity in amino
acid sequence, respectively, with Cj6OMT. Sequence analysis suggested that they contained 1056, 1044, 1041,
and 1041 base pairs, which encode 351, 347, 346, and 346 theoretical
amino acids with deduced isoelectric points (pI) at pH of 3.53, 5.85,
5.26, and 6.07, respectively.

Asterisks in all highlighted regions indicate conserved amino acid
residues.

Three putative NnCNMT sequences were isolated using NNU_11880 as template
and named as follows: NnCNMT1, NnCNMT2, and NnCNMT3. They shared 51% amino acid sequence
identity with CjCNMT (accession no. BAB71802) and
contained 1074, 1388, and 1224 base pairs, respectively (Figure S3). A stop codon influenced by alternative
splicing was found in NnCNMT2, resulting in premature
protein termination; therefore, NnCNMT2 was not used
for gene expression analysis. NnCNMT1 and NnCNMT3 encoded 358 and 408 theoretical amino acids with
a deduced pI at pH of 7.03 and 7.55, respectively.

The coding
sequences of isolated NnOMT35, NnOMT65, NnOMT66, NnOMT68, NnCNMT1, and NnCNMT3 were deposited in GenBank with accession
nos MG517490, MG517491, MG517492, MG517493, MG517494, and MG517495,
respectively. Amino acid sequence alignment of all isolated 6OMT presented
a conserved region as reported in Cj6OMT, indicated by the motifs
A, B, and C of a conserved S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding domain located at the C-terminal end containing
three conserved glycine residues (Figure 2B). However, the isolated CNMT gene possessed motif A alone (Figure 2C).20,21

One putative CYP80G2 gene
from this study was named NnCYP80G2. It contained 1,458 base pairs that encode 519 theoretical amino
acids, with a deduced pI at a pH of 5.70, and possessed conserved
eukaryotic P450 regions consisting of a helix K region, an aromatic
region, and a heme-binding region at the C-terminal end (Figure 2D). It shared over
80% amino acid similarity to known CYP80G2. The highest similarity
(%) was to corytuberine synthase (CTS) from Podophyllum
peltatum (accession no. AJD20230).10,11

For the WRKY transcript factors, all selected WRKY TFs presented the WRKY TF conserved region, as shown in Figure 2E, in which the β-sheet
WRKY DNA binding domain (DBD) is highlighted. WRKYGQK and WRKYGKK,
which are primary motifs of the DNA binding domain, were present in
eight sequences.15,17,22 The
other two putative WRKY TFs isolated from two identified
regions (NNU_11881RA and NNU_05136RA) were found to possess an unlikely
WKKY anomaly of the primary WRKYGKK motif of DBD.15

Increased BIA Content and
Related Gene Expression in Mechanically Wounded (W) Lotus Leaves
Plants have evolved defense mechanisms to respond to wounds and
pathogen infection by releasing endogenous molecules from wounded
areas. Consequently, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
activate the plant innate immune system and the expression of defense-related
genes.17 Defense responses mediated by
wounding are similar to those mediated by DAMPs or microbe-associated
molecular patterns. Thus, mechanical wounding has become a powerful
method used to study cellular activity in plants.23 In this study, four structural genes were found to display
quite different expression patterns during observation after wounding. CYP80G2 apparently responded first to mechanical
wounding, with an over 10-fold increase in its relative expression
level on day 0. NCS and CNMT slightly
increased on day 2, while 6OMT expressed a low and
late response. It is worth noting that CNMT and CYP80G2 shared parallel expression patterns
during days 2–7 (Figure 3A).

real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of wounded lotus leaves collected
on various observation days. (A) Bar graph shows the relative expression
of putative norcoclaurine synthase (NCS), norcoclaurine

TFs. (C) Sum of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine
contents in the wounded lotus leaves. Error bars show the standard
deviation (SD) of the mean. The different lowercase letters indicate
significant differences at p < 0.05.

Apart from the structural genes, WRKY TFs also showed promising behavior in this mechanism. Regarding the
predominantly detectable signal from qRT-PCR analysis, five putative WRKY TFs (NNU_09891, NNU_02028, NNU_05834, NNU_24385, and NNU_12194) were selected for this study. On day 0, their
relative expression levels in the wounded leaves were elevated by
over 10-fold compared to the control group. Two putative WRKY
TFs (NNU_09891 and NNU_24385) were recognized to have the greatest response, while other
candidates displayed small changes throughout a week of observations
(Figure 3B). Overall,
the order of BIA-related gene expression after wounding was as follows:
WRKY TFs (NNU_24385), CYP80G2, NCS, CNMT, and 6OMT.

Based on these results, CYP80G2 and WRKY TFs (NNU_24385) were deemed
to be the most sensitive wound-responding genes (Figure 3A,B). However, NCS and CNMT probably played an important role on day
2 because they increased in accordance with the significant increase
of the total BIA content (Figure 3C). The expression of both genes was correlated well
with the accumulation of nuciferine, which appeared to be about 3
times higher than that of N-nornuciferine. For the
two WRKY TFs, the fluctuation in their expression
patterns between days 0 and 3 in the wounded leaves suggested that
there was a limitation in the BIA production. Consequently, analysis
of the events in the neighboring, nonwounded (NW) tissues was conducted
to better understand these results.

Wounding Effects on Gene Expression and Bioactive Compound Accumulation
in Neighboring Tissues
Wound responses are known to occur
in both the wounded leaves (local response) and nonwounded leaves
(systematic response), which are generated by hormones such as jasmonic
acid or typical signaling of wounding, such as cell wall-derived oligogalacturonides
and so on.24 Therefore, the results obtained
from the wounded leaves were combined and analyzed here. The relative
expression levels of the structural genes and WRKY TFs in the nonwounded leaves exhibited massive, significant differences
compared to those in the wounded and control leaves (Figure 4A,B). It was also found that
variegated gene expression patterns of structural genes were observed
during days 0–4, whereas similar expression patterns of all
structural genes were observed on day 7. The structural genes in the
wounded leaves seemed to play a more sensitive role in this response
over those in the nonwounded leaves, as was suggested by the increase
of NCS and CNMT on day 2 in the
wounded leaves (Figure 4A). The transcript levels of WRKY TFs in the nonwounded
leaves apparently displayed enormous increases over those in the wounded
and control leaves; they also remained relatively high throughout
the observation period. NNU_24385 was again recognized
to be the predominant WRKY TF. It increased considerably
on day 0 after wounding, reached its highest transcript level on day
3, and then gradually increased until day 7 (Figure 4B). Taken together, all target genes exhibited
the same expression order as what was observed in the wounded leaves,
but they performed their roles at different time points in the nonwounded
leaves. Interestingly, the increases in CNMT and NNU_24385 on day 3 in the nonwounded leaves correlated well
with the highest total alkaloid accumulation (Figure 4A–C). Moreover, we could observe the
fluctuating accumulation of total alkaloid content between days and
leaves, as was clearly seen on days 2 and 3 (Figure 4C).

Role
of BIA-Related Genes in Normal and Abiotic Stress Conditions
To better understand the role of BIA-related genes in mechanical
wound response, we also studied the relationship between nuciferine
and N-nornuciferine accumulation and the expression
levels of their corresponding genes in normal leaves of commercial
lotus used in a previous study and also in nine varieties of wild
Thai lotus. Size-matched leaves were used, and wild lotuses were classified
based on their flower morphology (Figure 5A). The results suggested that, in normal
conditions, all subjected lotuses maintained high relative expressions
(%) of CYP80G2 and NCS and had quite low proportional expressions of the two methyltransferases
(Figure 5B). Interestingly,
WRKY TFs (NNU_24385) were a major component of the
transcripts, as was also found in the mechanical wounding experiment
(Figure 5C). Altogether,
the relative expression levels (%) of NCS and WRKY TFs (NNU_24385) seemed to correlate well with the accumulation of target compounds,
as shown in Figure 5D.

Discussion
In this
study, we isolated the sequences that were deemed to encode 6OMT,
CNMT, and CYP80G2 from lotus cDNA and retrieved five putative sequences
that were proposed to encode NCS from the GenBank database. Results
from amino acid sequence alignment of all isolated CNMT genes showed that they possessed a conserved region, as documented
in CjCNMT. This was indicated by the motif A of a conserved S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding domain,
located at the C-terminal end containing three conserved glycine residues.20,21 Unlike CNMT, all isolated 6OMT possessed motifs A, B, and C, with their conserved amino acid residues
(Figure 2B).25 This may suggest that 6OMT and CNMT can be easily
classified by the presence of these motifs. Phylogenetic analysis
also clearly indicated that Cj6OMT belongs to a different branch from
that of CjCNMT (Figure S3). The lotus 6OMT
shared a close relationship to Cj6OMT, while the lotus CNMT shared
a close relationship to CjCNMT. The putative NnCYP80G2 shared over 80% amino acid identity with corytuberine
synthase (CTS or CYP80G2) from P. peltatum. These possessed conserved eukaryotic P450 regions consisting of
a helix K region, an aromatic region, and a heme-binding region at
the C-terminal end (Figure 2D).10,11 Thus, NnCYP80G2 in this study was deemed to be involved in BIA biosynthesis.

WRKY transcription factors (TFs), which control overall BIA biosynthetic
pathways, were also characterized. Generally, WRKY TFs contain approximately
60 amino acids with four-stranded β-sheet WRKY DNA binding domains
(DBDs) and zinc-finger motifs. WRKY TFs are divided into three groups:
group I (2 WRKY DBDs), group II (single DBD with different C2H2 zinc finger), and group III (single DBD with C2HC zinc finger) (Figure 2E).15 All putative WRKY
TFs in this study possessed a single DBD together with a zinc-finger
motif; thus, they are characteristic of the group III type of WRKY
proteins. Such a characteristic has been reported in other alkaloid-producing
plant species, including AtWRKY70 in Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank accession no. AF421157), GmWRKY58 in Glycine max (GenBank
accession no. EU375357), and NtWRKY3 in Nicotiana tabacum (GenBank accession no. AF193770).15

All of the above sequences were used to
study their role in mechanically wounded lotus leaves. Overall, we
observed an enormous difference in the transcript level between the
control and the wounded leaf. According to the previous study of the
wound-associated signaling pathway in Arabidopsis leaf, it was found that the wounding alerted the intra- and interdefense
mechanism in leaves on the same plant.24 Thus, we designed to separately collect the control leaf from the
different plant to avoid this mechanism. The control leaf used in
this study represented normal growth condition with a normal transcript
level of all target genes. As a result, the gene expressions in the
control leaf maintained quite low transcript levels when compared
with those in the wounded leaf. Among the target genes, the putative CYP80G2 and one candidate WRKY TF, NNU_24385, were identified to be promising genes because
they clearly exhibited the most sensitivity in the wound response
system, as indicated by their massive transcript levels immediately
after wounding. Interestingly, increases in the expression of three
structural genes, NCS, CNMT, and CYP80G2, on day 2 correlated well with
BIA accumulation in wounded lotus leaves. NCS might
have both a major and a minor role in the accumulation of target compounds
because it is located in the initial step of the BIA pathway, providing
a simple BIA skeleton as a precursor for various BIA structures in
the complex array.26 This was clearly demonstrated
in the day 2 wounded leaves, in which NCS performed
its role in the initial days after wounding and then maintained high
transcript levels until day 7. The downstream methyltransferase enzymes
CNMT and 6OMT then subsequently took on the role for the modification
step on either the same or the following days. CNMT performed well
as a cofactor with CYP80G2, as indicated by the rapid formation of
nuciferine and N-nornuciferine products. We suggest
that coexpressions of CNMT and CYP80G2 in plant or bacterial systems would clarify
the collaboration of these genes. Moreover, a slight increase of 6OMT
during days 3–7 may suggest two possibilities. (1) Conversion
of N-nornuciferine and nuciferine to dehydronuciferine:
this compound presents in lotus leaf and is structurally formed via
dehydroxylation reaction as proposed in Figure 1B.5 This could
result in the decrease of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine
contents. (2) Migration of compounds to neighboring organs: high accumulation
of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine after mechanical
wounding might be toxic to the leaf tissues. The presence of these
compounds in their petiole may support that these overproduced metabolites
translocate to the petiole to decrease the chance of toxicity in the
leaf tissues.24,28 Further investigations on these
events are interesting.

Mechanical wounding affected related
gene expression and BIA accumulation not only in the wounded tissues,
but also in the neighboring tissues. Briefly, two structural genes
(CYP80G2 and CNMT) and one putative WRKY TF (NNU_24385) played an
important role on day 3 in the nonwounded leaf when the highest total
BIA content was detected, particularly nuciferine. The normal behavior
of CNMT in the mature leaves of all studied wild
Thai lotuses may support the conclusion that CNMT is another key gene for nuciferine production. Similarly, CNMT has
been reported to maintain low transcript levels in alkaloid-producing
plant species and is also involved in the bottleneck step of alkaloid
biosynthesis.21,26 The results herein underlined
the fact that CNMT is a promising gene, which may
have a potent role in nuciferine accumulation in lotus leaves.

Besides the biosynthetic genes, TFs are known to play an important
role in the regulation of BIA production. Molecular study showed the
regulation of WRKY TFs on secondary metabolite production, such as
that of phenolic compounds and alkaloids.15 Therefore, additional studies of transcript levels of WRKY
TFs along with other biosynthetic genes will be helpful for
the improvement of alkaloid production. We found that NNU_24385 seemed to be a predominant WRKY TF among all
those examined because its expression level was related to the highest
accumulation of target compounds in both wounded and nonwounded leaves
(Figure 4B). According
to our phylogenetic analysis, NNU_24385 shares the
highest percent similarity in amino acid sequences with CjWRKY1, which regulates BIA biosynthesis in C. japonica.18 WRKY1 from alkaloid-producing species,
including C. roseus, C. japonica, and A. thaliana, has been reported to have potential function in BIA biosynthesis,
and wounding could also induce the WRKY TF expression,
which subsequently regulates the BIA pathway in P.
somniferum.15,17 In addition, WRKY1 from Arabidopsis triggered the transcript level of the cytochrome
P450-dependent oxidase berbamunine synthase (CYP80A1), leading to increased alkaloid production in callus
culture of California poppy.10 Likewise, NNU_24385 was found to be the most active transcript in
the mature leaf of most selected wild Thai lotuses (Figure 5A,B). This may suggest that NNU_24385 is a wound-related WRKY TF and is responsible
for BIA accumulation in lotus leaves. Additionally, metabolite translocation
may occur in the tissues as a result of the fluctuation in BIA content
among days because high quantities of secondary metabolites can be
toxic to plant tissues themselves.24,27,28

Our study provides some insight into the biosynthetic
pathway of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine in lotus.
To date, the chemical structures of various BIAs have been reported
in Nelumbo organs, for example in the embryo, rhizome,
flower, and leaf; however, their biosynthesis pathways are not yet
documented.1,3,29−31 Accordingly, we mapped
the reported BIAs’ structures elucidated from those organs
and known BIA-related enzymes together, as shown in Figure 1A.1,10,11,14,29 Normally, the order of structural enzymes in simple
BIA complex arrays occurs with the use of NCS, 6OMT, and CNMT to generate
norcoclaurine, (S)-coclaurine, and methylcoclaurine,
respectively.29,32,33 We
further predicted that CYP80G2 might later occupy the BIA backbone
to yield lirinidine, and then 7OMT will form nuciferine (Figure 1A). Alternatively, N-nornuciferine might be constructed via a different array
by CYP80G2, 7OMT, and 6OMT, respectively (Figure 1B). The roles of CYP80G2 and CNMT in the mechanically wounded lotus leaf suggested that C–C
coupling and methylation at the N position of the isoquinoline nucleus
may occur before O-methylation; thus, the proposed
biosynthetic pathway following these results has been drawn (Figure 1B). Determining the
structures of asimilobine and O-nornuciferine could
support the results from our mechanical wounding experiment and lead
to clarification of the possible pathway of nuciferine. Nuciferine
is probably produced via CYP80G2, CNMT, and 6OMT, respectively. Similarly,
nuciferine could be directly generated from asimilobine and N-nornuciferine via CYP80G2, 6OMT, and CNMT, respectively.
Our findings on asimilobine, O-nornuciferine, and N-nornuciferine structures suggested that methylation on
the N or O position of the isoquinoline nucleus might not occur sequentially;
hence, we proposed two possible pathways that lead to the formation
of nuciferine. Our results of relative gene expression using the mechanical
wounding method provide information on some parts of this mechanism.
Further study on the function of these genes is required for better
understanding and confirmation of the pathways.

Methods
Plant Materials
Commercial lotuses purchased from a well-known market in the Bangkok,
Thailand, area were used for the mechanical wounding experiment on
lotus leaves. A total of nine wild Thai lotuses were collected from
the germplasm located in the collection of Rajamangkala University
of Technology Tawan-ok, Chonburi, Thailand, and used to study gene
expression profiles and BIA accumulation in lotus leaves under normal
conditions. According to the taxonomic description retrieved from
The Botanical Garden Organization, Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (http://www.qsbg.org/webBGO/database.html),
the commercial lotus is classified as Album Plenum, while the wild
lotuses were classified into three groups: Album Plenum, Rosem Plenum
lotus, and Bua Khem Chin.

Gene Isolation
Using Specifically Designed Primers
Four structural genes,
including NCS, 6OMT, CNMT, and CYP80G2, as well as alkaloid-related
WRKY TFs were targeted in this study. Five amino acid sequences of
NnNCS were accessed from the GenBank database with accession nos ANI26411,
ANI26412, ANI26413, AND61511, and AND61512.19 Meanwhile, target genes that are related to 6OMT, CNMT, and CYP80G2
were isolated from lotus cDNA by specific primers designed based on
predicted nucleotide sequences accessed for the lotus (Table S1). These were subsequently used in quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which was carried out
as described in a previous study.19 The
amplified cDNA fragments were inserted into pEASY-T1 vector (TransGen
Biotech, Beijing, China) and subsequently sequenced. Meanwhile, a
total of 60 deduced amino sequences of lotus WRKY TF were retrieved
from the lotus genome (http://lotus-db.wbgcas.cn) using
the BLAST analysis against C. japonica WRKY1 (GenBank accession no. AB26740).34 Due to the close relationship among known WRKY TFs in BIA-producing plant species, only 10 out of 60 sequences were
selected for qRT-PCR analysis (Figure S1).

Phylogenetic Tree Analysis
Translated amino acid sequences of all target genes retrieved from
the Expasy translate tool (http://web.expasy.org/translate/) were aligned with MUSCLE alignment, and they were further analyzed
for their phylogenetic relationships using MEGA7 program.35 The resulting data matrix was analyzed using
equally weighted maximum parsimony. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
using a maximum likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model.
The topology with the most superior log-likelihood value was selected.
The bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1000 replicates, and
branches with less than 50% bootstrap support were collapsed.

Expression Profile of BIA-Related Genes Using
RT-PCR
Approximately 100 mg of each sample was finely ground
in liquid nitrogen and then subjected to total RNA isolation and genomic
DNA removal using an RNA prep pure kit for polysaccharides and polyphenolics-rich
plants (TIANGEN China). cDNA synthesis was conducted in one step using
ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (NEB England). Next, 500 ng of
each cDNA template was then mixed in 10 μL total of real-time
PCR reaction mixture in the presence of 5 μL of 2 × iTaq
Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD) and 0.2 μM of each primer
(Tables S2 and S3). Lotus actin gene (accession
no. XM_010267617) was used as a constitutive control. The amplification
program was set as described in a previous study.19 The samples were prepared in triplicate, and procedures
were performed in a BIO-RAD T100 Thermal Cycler (BIO-RAD).

Wounding Experiment
Fully opened leaves
from lotus shoots with sizes of 11 cm × 13 cm were chosen for
use in three treatments as follows: control leaf, wounded (W) leaf,
and nonwounded (NW) leaf. The control leaves were selected separately,
whereas the W and NW leaf treatments were separately performed on
two abaxial sites of the same leaf lined by the midrib. Mechanical
wounding was performed by making several parallel cuts on the wounded
leaves using a sterile surgical blade no. 21 (Skidmore Instruments,
England) (Figure 4D).
The W and NW treatments were observed at the following set observation
days: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days after treatment.

Identification and Measurement of Alkaloid Composition by HPLC
Analysis
Alkaloid extraction and separation methods used
herein were the same as those described in a previous study.5 Separation and detection were performed by HPLC-DAD
(SHIMADZU) using a TOSOH C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3.5 μm
diameter). Nuciferine and N-nornuciferine alkaloid
contents were determined against the linear standard curves of nuciferine
(Yuanye Biotechnology Shanghai, China) as a representative aporphine-type
alkaloid (Figure S2). The peak areas of
nuciferine and N-nornuciferine were pooled to calculate
the total content of major BIAs.

Validation
of HPLC Assay
Six concentrations of nuciferine standard,
including 5, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 μg/mL, were prepared in
extraction buffer to make a calibration curve of aporphine-type BIA
standard for HPLC analysis and to measure the recoveries of alkaloids
from the assay using a standard addition method. They were then subjected
to alkaloid extraction and separation following the reference protocol
mentioned above. Their recoveries at each concentration listed above
were 65.75, 97.40, 103.15, 103.07, 103.44, and 96.38%, respectively.
The relative standard deviation of interday injection repeats was
0.26%. These values suggested that the HPLC system was reliable.36,37

Statistical Analysis
Triplicates
of each alkaloid standard and samples were subjected to analyses to
determine statistical significance in SPSS software version 21 with
one-way analysis of variance methods. Significant differences were
defined as those with p < 0.05.
