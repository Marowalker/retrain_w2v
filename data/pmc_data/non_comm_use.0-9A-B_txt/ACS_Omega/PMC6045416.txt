Chemical modification with specific
functional groups has been
the conventional method to develop bone-bonding bioactive organic–inorganic
hybrids. These materials are attractive as bone substitutes because
they are flexible and have a Young’s modulus similar to natural
bone. Immobilization of sulfonic acid groups (−SO3H) onto the polymer chain is expected to produce such hybrids because
these groups induce apatite formation in a simulated body fluid (SBF)
and enhance the activity of osteoblast-like cells. Sulfinic acid groups
(−SO2H), which are derivatives of −SO3H, can also induce apatite nucleation. However, the structural
effects of such sulfur-containing functional groups on apatite formation
have not been elucidated. In the present study, apatite formation
on Ca2+-modified copolymers containing −SO2H or −SO3H was investigated in a simulated body
environment. The copolymer containing Ca2+ and −SO3H promoted Ca2+ release into the SBF and formed
apatite faster (1 day) than the copolymer containing Ca2+ and −SO2H (14 days). In contrast, when they were
not modified with Ca2+, the copolymer containing only −SO2H deposited the apatite faster (7 days) than that containing
only −SO3H (>7 days) in the solution with Ca2+ concentration 1.5 times that of SBF. The former adsorbed
larger amounts of Ca2+ than the latter. The measured stability
constant of the complex indicated that the interaction of −SO2–···Ca2+ was more
stable than that of −SO3–···Ca2+. It was found that both the release and adsorption of Ca2+ governed by the stability played an important role in induction
of the apatite formation and that the apatite-forming ability of sulfur-containing
functional groups drastically changed by the coexistence of Ca2+.

1 Introduction
Modifying with specific
functional groups on the surface of implant
materials to repair bone defects provides the implants with bone-bonding
ability (i.e., bioactivity). Bone bonding is required for the longevity
of the implant. Hench first showed that Bioglass bonds to the living
bone without a foreign body reaction.1 Subsequently,
the glass ceramic A-W2 and sintered hydroxyapatite3,4 were developed as bioactive ceramics. When glass-based bioactive
materials are implanted, the formation of low crystalline apatite
induced by the surface Si–OH group and the release of Ca2+ is an important factor in their bonding to the living bone.5

Research has revealed that functional groups
other than Si–OH
allow the bonelike apatite formation on the material surface. Ti–OH,6 Zr–OH,7 Ta–OH,8 carboxyl (−COOH),9 phosphate (−PO4H2),9 and sulfonate (−SO3H)10 groups induced heterogeneous nucleation of apatite in a
simulated body fluid (SBF). SBF contains inorganic ions similar to
those found in human blood plasma but does not contain the proteins.11,12 Modifications of these functional groups have been used to fabricate
bioactive metals,13,14 organic–inorganic hybrids,15,16 and polymer materials.17 In particular,
bioactive organic–inorganic hybrids and organic polymers are
expected to be good bone substitutes as they can form into a defect
shape and have a Young’s modulus similar to the living bone.

To improve the biological compatibility of the hybrids and polymers,
the effects of sulfonic acid group modification on apatite formation
in SBF and activity of osteoblast-like cells on the surface have been
examined. Miyazaki et al. created organic–inorganic hybrids
consisting of poly[vinylsulfonic acid-co-2-hydoxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA)] and Ca2+.18 These hybrids formed apatite within 7 days in SBF and exhibited
plastic deformation under mechanical property tests. Chaterji and
Gemeinhart demonstrated that the increased sulfate group content in
the poly(sulfopropyl acrylate-co-acrylamide) hydrogel
improved the adhesion and proliferation of MG-63 osteoblast-like cells
as a result of increased serum protein uptake.19 Modification by plasma treatment also increased the activity
of the osteoblasts on the scaffold because it allowed vitronection
adsorption.20 Therefore, incorporating
sulfonic acid groups is potentially a way to prepare bioactive flexible
materials.

We previously reported the apatite-forming ability
of copolymers
modified with Ca2+ and the sulfinic acid (−SO2H) group in SBF.21 The copolymers
formed apatite, and its morphology was significantly different by
the existence of −SO2H. These results mean that
the −SO2H group also induced heterogeneous nucleation
of the apatite in SBF. Although both −SO3H and −SO2H consist of the same elements, the number of bonding oxygen
atoms in the structure is different. It is assumed that the structural
differences affect the stability of the interaction with Ca2+ because the large number of oxygen atoms leads to stable ionized
acidic functional groups because of the delocalization of the negative
charge.22 In fact, our previous research
revealed that the stability of the interaction between the Ca2+ and −PO3H2 groups significantly
changed the apatite-forming behavior of the Ca2+-modified
copolymers in SBF, depending on the chemical structure of the phosphate.23 However, the structural effects of sulfur-containing
acidic functional groups on the apatite-forming ability of the copolymers
remain unclear.

In this study, we prepared copolymers consisting
of Ca2+ and an organic matrix modified with −SO3H or −SO2H groups using sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate
(NaVBSO3) or sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfinate (NaVBSO2) and
HEMA. The mineralization behavior on the surface of hybrids was examined
to determine the structural effects using analytical and surface chemistry
techniques.

2 Results
Figure 1 shows the
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of different copolymer
specimens before being soaked in the CaCl2 solution. The
HEMA peak in both spectra was observed at 1072 cm–1, which was attributed to stretching vibration of the O–C
bond for alcohol.24 In addition, peaks
corresponding to the vibration of CH3 and torsion of the
OH groups of HEMA were observed at 1146–1148 cm–1. For both specimens, in-plane deformation vibrations of C–H
and stretching vibration of S=O bonds were observed at 1030
and 1008 cm–1,25 respectively.
They were derived from both types of monomer-containing sulfur. VBSO3 displayed a peak corresponding to the antisymmetric stretching
vibration of O=S=O at 1122 cm–1,26 but VBSO2 did not.

specimens. VBSO2 and VBSO3 contained nearly
equivalent levels of each group. However, the content of Ca in VBSO3 2.5Ca was slightly lower than in VBSO2 2.5Ca. Figure 3 shows the change
in Ca concentration in the tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)–NaCl
buffer after soaking the different specimens treated with the CaCl2 solution as a function of soaking time. The Ca concentration
increased up to a soaking time of 1 day, slightly decreased, and then
became almost constant for both specimens. The Ca concentration of
VBSO3 2.5Ca after soaking was higher than that of VBSO2 2.5Ca regardless of soaking time.

3 Discussion
Copolymers with nearly equivalent amounts of different acidic functional
groups were successfully obtained using the same method (Figure 2A). This was confirmed
by FT-IR spectra showing that only VBSO3 displayed the
O=S=O peak characteristic to −SO3H
(Figure 1). The apatite
formation in SBF was faster on VBSO3 than on VBSO2 when they were treated with CaCl2 solution (Figure 4). This means that
−SO3H on the copolymers was more effective for apatite
formation than −SO2H with coexistence of Ca2+.

The induction of the apatite formation on a substrate
depends on
the surface conditions and supersaturation degree with respect to
apatite in SBF.27 The release of Ca2+ from the surface is especially effective for increasing
the supersaturation degree.5 VBSO3 2.5Ca was able to release larger amounts of Ca2+ than
VBSO2 2.5Ca (Figure 3), meaning that the former provided more favorable conditions
for the apatite formation in SBF. However, the Ca content in VBSO3 2.5Ca was lower than that in VBSO2 2.5Ca after
soaking in CaCl2 solution (Figure 2B). The Ca2+ release from the
copolymers into the SBF is expected to be governed by the initial
Ca content and its binding with surrounding anionic functional groups.
It has been reported that Ca2+ release is inhibited by
the increased −SO3H content in the copolymers via
formation of a complex such as (−SO3–)2···Ca2+.18

In this study, the copolymers were composed of functional
groups
with different structures. The change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) during the formation of the complex is related to the
stability constant of the complex (β) as shown in eq 1 1  where R is the gas constant
and T is the temperature of the solution. On the
basis of the measured stability constant of the Ca2+ complex
(Table 1), the formation
of (−SO2–)2···Ca2+ gave a lower negative value of ΔG than (−SO3–)2···Ca2+ at the same temperature. The difference in ΔG value indicates that the interaction of (−SO2–)2···Ca2+ was thermodynamically more stable than (−SO3–)2···Ca2+ under
physiological conditions. Thus, it is assumed that the ability of
−SO3H to trap Ca2+ in the copolymers
is weak, which results in the enhancement of the Ca2+ release.
Modification with −SO3H has the advantage of apatite
formation on the hybrids.

In contrast, −SO2H in VBSO2 0Ca induced
the apatite formation faster than −SO3H in VBSO3 0Ca under the condition in which Ca2+ was not
released to keep the supersaturation degree constant with respect
to the apatite (Figure 5A,B). This phenomenon is opposite to what happens to the present
copolymers modified with Ca2+. Dey et al. observed the
mechanism of apatite formation on the monolayer of arachidic acid
in SBF using cryo-TEM.28 They showed that
50–80 nm diameter spherical nodules of amorphous calcium phosphate
were formed by the aggregation of the calcium phosphate complex on
the monolayer, resulting in conversion to apatite. Habraken et al.
determined that the composition of the amorphous phase is [Ca2(HPO4)3]2–, which
grows into Ca-defected octacalcium phosphate as a precursor of the
apatite in the solution.29 In the present
study, both VBSO2 0Ca and VBSO3 0Ca also initially
formed particles on their surfaces with diameters similar to the above
reports (Figure 6).
Moreover, Ca and P consumption in SBF1.5Ca within 5 days suggested
calcium phosphate formation on VBSO2 0Ca and VBSO3 0Ca (Figure 7). Thus,
it is assumed that −SO2H could induce formation
of a larger amount of calcium phosphate as a precursor of the apatite
at an earlier stage of soaking than −SO3H.

According to previous reports on the heterogeneous nucleation process
of apatite, bioactive materials initially adsorb Ca2+,
and then phosphate ions on their surface form calcium phosphate in
the SBF.30,31 Yamashita et al. reported that hydroxyapatite
subjected to electric poling had a highly negatively charged surface
and promoted apatite formation because the amount of adsorbed Ca2+ increased on its surface.32 However,
ion–ion interactions with Ca2+ were also considered
as a factor of the Ca2+ adsorption for apatite formation.9 Judging from the higher rate of decrease in Ca
concentration at the initial stage of soaking (Figure 7), it is assumed that VBSO2 0Ca
had a more favorable surface for Ca2+ adsorption compared
with VBSO3 0Ca. There was no significant difference in
the zeta potential on each specimen (Table 1). Therefore, the different stability constants
of the two complexes should be the main factor affecting the apatite-forming
ability, although statistical significance remains to be confirmed
in the future.

On the basis of the discussion described above,
the detailed mechanism
of apatite formation on the copolymer in SBF1.5Ca is expected to progress
as follows. (1) Chemical interaction of −SO3–···Ca2+ or −SO2–···Ca2+ was constructed
on the surface of each specimen at initial stage of soaking. (2) HPO42– in SBF1.5Ca was adsorbed on the surface
because the surface potential increases from negative to positive
after the initial adsorption of Ca2+.30,31 (3) HPO42– reacted with the Ca2+ bonded to the functional groups to form the spherical particles
of amorphous calcium phosphate (Figure 6). (4) The amorphous particles transformed and grew
into apatite (Figure 5) because of the consumption of the ions in SBF1.5Ca (Figure 7). Regarding the reaction in
the process (3), our previous research suggests that formation of
Ca2+···HPO42– interaction increases the concentration of the calcium phosphate
complexes which aggregate to the [Ca2(HPO4)3]2– cluster on the copolymer.23 Moreover, Kawai et al. reported that the crystal
growth of apatite is governed by the supersaturation degree regardless
of the type of anionic functional groups on the surface in a simulated
body environment.27 It means that difference
in the chemical structure of functional groups changes the behavior
of apatite formation during the process of (1–3) without Ca2+ release from the copolymer. Therefore, it is assumed that
−SO2H adsorbed a large amount of Ca2+ and accelerated the Ca2+···HPO42– formation and the subsequent aggregation, resulting
in enhancement of the apatite deposition on VBSO2 0Ca.

In conclusion, it was found that the apatite formation induced
by various sulfur-containing functional groups was significantly altered
by the coexistence of Ca2+. Namely, the low stability of
−SO3–···Ca2+ improved the apatite-forming ability of the Ca2+-modified copolymers, although −SO3H by itself
had a lower ability of inducing heterogeneous apatite nucleation than
−SO2H. This is because Ca2+ released
from the −SO3–···Ca2+ decreased the activation energy for heterogeneous nucleation
and increased the rate of crystal growth on the copolymers. It has
been reported that apatite growth on the polymer substrate is also
related to the supersaturation degree in the simulated body environment.27

The Ca2+ bound to the material
surface can adsorb the
proteins, leading to the osteoblast adhesion and osteoconductivity
of the titanium.33,34 In addition, it has been reported
that suitable Ca2+ concentration in the medium impacts
osteoblast differentiation.35 Consequently,
it is expected that the structural differences of these functional
groups affect the osteoblast activities and the bone-bonding ability
through the state of binding with Ca2+. To confirm this,
the behavior of protein adsorption and the activities of the cells
on the different hybrids should be investigated.

4 Conclusions
The apatite-forming behavior of copolymers modified with −SO2H or −SO3H was examined in a simulated body
environment. When they were modified with Ca2+, −SO3H formed apatite on the surface faster than −SO2H. It was assumed that the low stability of −SO3–···Ca2+ had the
advantage of Ca2+ release, which promoted both heterogeneous
nucleation and crystal growth of the apatite. In contrast, the opposite
phenomenon was observed when they were not modified with Ca2+. High stability of the −SO2–···Ca2+ interaction enhanced the heterogeneous
nucleation of the apatite on the copolymers. It was found that the
stability of the interaction with Ca2+ depended on the
structure of these functional groups and was an important factor governing
the apatite formation.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Specimen Preparation
NaVBSO2 (90%, Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and NaVBSO3 (90%,
Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, USA) were used to incorporate
the −SO2H and −SO3H groups, respectively,
into the copolymer. A total of 1.0 mmol of NaVBSO2 or NaVBSO3 and 9.0 mmol of HEMA (95%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries
Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were dissolved in ultrapure water. Furthermore,
5.0 × 10–4 mol of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (99%, Wako Pure Chemical
Industries Ltd.) and 1.5 × 10–5 mol of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (98%, Wako Pure Chemical
Industries Ltd.) and 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride
(95%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) were added. The mixture
of these regents was adjusted to a total volume of 10 cm3 in a volumetric flask. To copolymerize these monomers, 1 cm3 of the resulting solution was put in a polyethylene cup at
60 °C for 1 day.

The obtained copolymers were cut into
ϕ 5 × 1 mm cylinders. They were soaked in 1 kmol·m–3 HCl solution for 1 day to remove the unreacted reagents
and sodium ions, soaked in ultrapure water for 1 day, and then dried
in vacuum. The obtained copolymers were then soaked in 30 cm3 of 0 or 2.5 mol·m–3 CaCl2 solution
at 36.5 °C for 1 day. The copolymers prepared from NaVBSO2 and NaVBSO3 were abbreviated as VBSO2XCa and VBSO3XCa,
respectively, where X indicates the concentration
of the CaCl2 solution used. VBSO2 and VBSO3 indicate the specimens without CaCl2 treatment.

5.2 Soaking Specimens in SBF and SBF1.5Ca To Evaluate
Apatite-Forming Ability
The cylindrical VBSO2 2.5Ca
and VBSO3 2.5Ca specimens were soaked in 30 cm3 of SBF (Na+ 142.0, K+ 5.0, Mg2+ 1.5, Ca2+ 2.5, Cl– 147.8, HCO3– 4.2, HPO42– 1.0,
SO42– 0.5 mol·m–3, pH 7.40) for various time intervals. In addition, 9 mg of powdered
VBSO2 0Ca and VBSO3 0Ca specimens was soaked
in SBF1.5Ca, which has Ca2+ concentration 1.5 times that
of the normal SBF36 with a pH 7.25 at 36.5
°C for various time intervals. The powder was prepared by cooling
the bulk specimen using liquid N2 and pulverizing it with
a porcelain mill and agate balls.

SBF and SBF1.5Ca were prepared
by dissolution of NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl, K2HPO4·3H2O, MgCl2·6H2O, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 (Nacalai Tesque,
Inc., Kyoto, Japan) in ultrapure water in that order. The pH for each
resulting solution was adjusted by the addition of 1 kmol·m–3 HCl solution and Tris (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.).

5.3 Soaking Specimens in Tris–NaCl Buffer
To Measure Ca2+ Release
The hybrid specimens were
soaked in 30 cm3 of Tris–NaCl buffer (NaCl 142,
Tris 50 mol·m–3, pH 7.40) at 36.5 °C for
various time intervals to measure the amount of released Ca2+. The Tris–NaCl buffer was prepared by the addition of NaCl
and Tris in ultrapure water, and the pH was adjusted with the addition
of 1 mol·m–3 HCl.

5.4 Specimen
Characterization
The chemical
structure of the different copolymers was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy
(FT/IR-6100, JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan) using an attenuated total reflectance
method. The content of acidic functional groups in the specimens was
measured by neutralizing titration. A 30 cm3 of 0.16 kmol·m–3 NaCl solution with specimens soaked without Ca2+ was titrated with 10.0 mol·m–3 of
the NaOH solution. The point of neutralization was determined by the
change in pH of the solution measured by a pH meter (F-23IIC, Horiba
Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). To determine the Ca content in the specimens,
the decrease in Ca concentration in the CaCl2 solution
after soaking of specimens was measured using inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES; ICPE-9820, SHIMADZU
Co., Kyoto, Japan).

After the specimens were soaked in SBF or
SBF1.5Ca, they were analyzed by TF-XRD (MXP3V, Mac Science Co., Yokohama,
Japan) and EDX (EMAX Energy, Horiba Ltd) equipped with a scanning
electron microscope (S-3500N, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan). In the TF-XRD
analysis, the incident X-ray (monochromatic Cu Kα radiation)
was fixed at 1° relative to the specimen surface with a scan
rate of 0.02°·s–1. After the immersion
in SBF1.5Ca, the powder specimens were deposited onto a Cu grid with
250 mesh (ELS-C10, Okenshoji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Ultrapure water
was then added several times to remove the SBF1.5Ca from the grid.
The surface was then observed with a transmission electron microscope
(JEM-3010, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

The surface zeta potential
of the powdered copolymer specimens
was measured by the zeta potential analyzer (ELS-Z, Otsuka Electronic
Co., Osaka, Japan). The Tris–NaCl buffer with soaked specimens
was injected into the quartz cell, and the electrophilic mobility
was measured by the laser Doppler method to calculate the zeta potential.
The Ca concentration in the Tris–NaCl buffer and Ca and P concentrations
in the specimens soaked in SBF1.5Ca for various time intervals were
measured using ICP–AES.

5.5 Determination
of the Stability Constant of
the Complexes
The stability constant of the complexes, which
consisted of Ca2+ and the ligand of ionized p-toluenesulfinic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid,
was determined to compare the thermodynamic stability of the interaction
between Ca2+ and each acid group. A 3.0–4.2 mmol
of sodium p-toluenesulfinate (98%, Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd.) or p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate
(99%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) was dissolved in 30 cm3 of mol·m–3 CaCl2 solution.
The ion strength and pH were adjusted to 0.16 and 6.4–6.7,
respectively, by the addition of NaCl and Tris. The free Ca2+ concentration in the solution was measured using a Ca2+-ion-selective electrode (6583-10C, Horiba Ltd.). The stability constant,
β, of the Ca2+ complex was calculated with eq 2 2  where [L2···Ca2+], [L], and [Ca2+] are molar concentrations of
the complex, free ligand, and free Ca2+, respectively.
[L]total and [Ca2+]total are the
total concentration of ligand and Ca2+ in the solution,
respectively.
