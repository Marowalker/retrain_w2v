Formation of biological
materials is a well-controlled process
that is orchestrated by biomolecules such as proteins. Proteins can
control the nucleation and mineralization of biomaterials, thereby
forming the hard tissues of biological organisms, such as bones, teeth,
and shells. In this study, the design and implementation of multifunctional
designer proteins are demonstrated for fluorescent silica micro/nanoparticle
synthesis. The R5 motif of silaffin polypeptide, which is known for
its silicification capability, was fused genetically into three spectrally
distinct fluorescent proteins with the intention of forming modified
fluorescent proteins. The bifunctional R5 peptide domain served as
a tag to provide silica synthesis at ambient conditions. Three functional
fusion constructs have been prepared, including GFPmut3-R5, Venus
YFP-R5, and mCherry-R5. Recombinant fluorescent proteins were purified
using silica-binding peptide tag through silica gel resin. Purified
proteins were tested for their binding affinity to silica using quartz
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring to make sure they
can interact strong enough with the silica surfaces. Later, engineered
fluorescent proteins were used to synthesize silica nano/microparticles
using silica precursor materials. Synthesized silica particles were
investigated for their fluorescence properties, including time-resolved
fluorescence. Additionally, elemental analysis of the particles was
carried out using electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy-filtered
transmission electron microscopy. Last, they were tested for their
biocompatibility. In this study, we aimed to provide a biomimetic
route to synthesize fluorescent silica nanoparticles. Recombinant
fluorescent proteins-directed silica nanoparticles synthesis offers
a one-step, reliable method to produce fluorescent particles both
for biomaterial applications and other nanotechnology applications.

1 Introduction
Biological
synthesis and assembly of inorganic solid nanostructures
are performed by most organisms in nature.1,2 Many
organisms are capable of synthesizing materials to form hard tissues,
such as bones, teeth, and shells.3 These
structures are synthesized by controlling many different protein cascades.
For instance, biological apatite crystals possess well-defined elemental
compositions and crystal structures that are responsible for imparting
hard tissues such as bone and teeth with their characteristic properties.
Extracellular matrix proteins regulate the nucleation and growth of
these biological apatites during hard tissue development.4−6 The formation of the layered shell structure of mollusks is also
regulated by peptides and proteins. Inorganic CaCO3 and
organic biopolymers provide the toughness and fracture strength of
nacre.7,8 Diatoms are microscopic unicellular algae
that can synthesize silica nanostructures around the cell membrane
to keep themselves protected from external threats. Silica cell walls
(frustules) of diatoms have intriguing shapes and enhanced optical
properties that help in the light harvesting process of photosynthesis.
Newly divided diatom cells retrieve half of the old frustule from
the mother cell, whereas the other half is produced from silica precursors.9 Frustules are composed of hierarchical nanostructured
species-specific patterns. Frustule structures have been shown to
enhance the conversion of light to chemical energy by increasing the
interaction of photons with light harvesting molecules and focusing
light onto chloroplasts.10,11

Although well-established
chemical and physical methods exist for
nano/micromaterial synthesis,12 these approaches
are often obliged to use environmentally harmful substances in greater
amounts and reactions generally take place in extreme conditions in
terms of the solution pH, humidity, environmental pressure, and temperature.
On the other hand, biological synthesis generally happens at ambient
conditions and involves harmless substances in minute quantities,
which is better for the environment.13,14 Until this
time, mimicking of frustules by biological synthesis methods has been
limited largely to the replication of processes that have already
been achieved by chemical and physical methods. Living biohybrids
refer to systems involving the encapsulation of yeast or bacterial
cells that maintain their metabolic activity, as well as conceptual
whole cell biosynthesizers that can perform biomineralization at ambient
conditions.15,16 However, bottom-up biosynthesis
of complex, hierarchical silica nanostructures depends on the development
of strict temporal and spatial control on a genetic multi-input biosystem.

Although frustules are composed almost entirely of silica, silicifying
peptides and polysaccharides contribute to the three-dimensional (3D)
organization of silica.17,18 Among diatom silica
cell wall-related proteins, silaffins are central as a template for
the synthesis and hierarchical order of frustules. R5 peptide is a
well-studied subunit of the silaffin protein of Cylindrotheca
fusiformis and has been shown to induce silica structure
formation from silica precursors like silicic acid.19 Studies also show that bacteria-synthesized R5 peptide
can induce the synthesis of silica nanoparticles from precursor molecules.20 Several studies have demonstrated the potency
of R5 peptide in synthesizing silica nano/microstructures capable
of encapsulating protein cargo.21−24 Additionally, fusion of R5 with green fluorescent
protein (GFP) was shown to induce the formation of silica nanoparticles
while allowing protein purification by histidine tagging or S-tagging.25,26

Fluorescent nanoparticles have been of great interest for
many
applications because of their unusual stability and optical properties
(such as narrow emission spectrum etc.). Among the fluorescent nanoparticles,
quantum dots have been investigated and developed for many applications.
They have excellent optical properties that are useful for applications
in physics, but a major drawback for their use in humans is their
inherent toxicity.27,28 Therefore, development of biocompatible
fluorescent particles having optical properties that are comparable
to quantum dots is of great importance for applications in biomedicine.
When fused to a fluorescent protein (FP), R5 can nucleate silica around
the FP in a manner analogous to the formation of diatom frustules.
The resulting hybrid dots can increase the optical properties of FPs
and serve as a candidate for the development of optically superior
fluorescent modules exhibiting low toxicity profiles, which is of
substantial importance for their biomedical applications.

Affinity
tags have found much use in biology to recover proteins
from whole cell extracts in high purity.29 Rapid and cost-effective methods for protein affinity purification
have been developed using silica tags.30,31 Silica tags
such as ribosomal protein L2, CotB1p, and Car9 are utilized as silica-interacting
molecules and show affinity for silica gel matrices or surfaces due
to their positively charged (R or K-rich) compositions.32 The majority of affinity tags must be cleaved
by enzymes from the target protein to ensure the latter’s function,
avoid immune response, or allow crystallization.33 However, tag removal causes an increase in the total cost
and prolongs the process.

In this study, to further increase
the potency of silica tags in
silica biohybrid synthesis studies, R5 peptide is used as a fusion
tag for fluorescent proteins (FPs) prior to the synthesis process,
enabling both the purification of the fusion protein in a silica gel
matrix and formation of silica particles from precursor molecules.
Final particle silica entrapment does not affect the fluorescent lifetime
of the synthesized fluorescent proteins and they are found to be biocompatible.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Genetic Constructs and
Heterologous Expression
of FPs
The position of the R5 tag may dramatically change
the function of fluorescent proteins. To test whether this effect
altered peptide function under the present design, R5 tag-coding sequence
was placed on either the 5′ or the 3′ end of the genetic
constructs. Although fluorescence microscopy results have given positive
green fluorescence for both of the constructs, fluorescence spectroscopy
results reveal that the excitation–emission maxima shifted
for R5-GFP, where the silica tag-coding sequence was added to the
upstream of the GFP-coding sequence (Figure S1). To avoid excitation–emission shifts, the remaining constructs
were designed to attach the R5 tag-coding sequence to the 3′
end of the fluorescent protein-coding sequence in all genetic designs
(Figure 1A). Two different
approaches were included while adding R5 tag-coding sequence to the
end of each fluorescent protein DNA sequence. The first approach involves
the addition of the R5 tag-coding sequence by successive extension
polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). We also synthesized the R5 tag
DNA sequence to use it as one of the fragments for the Gibson assembly
reaction. Both approaches were proven to be successful by Sanger sequencing
(.A). Constructs were ligated into an aTc-inducible vector. The inducible
vector also includes a tightly regulated synthetic riboregulator system
(taRNA–crRNA) to inhibit possible leakage.34 The genetic system leaks very little or not at all when
the inducer is absent (Figures S3 and S4).

Binding kinetics to the silica quartz surface is shown as a resonance
frequency change. Protein solutions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
are sequentially administered in increasing concentrations (shown
by arrows). Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
(QCM-D) experiments ran for other protein constructs too, adsorption
isotherms can be found in Supporting Information.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells that are transformed
with GFP-R5,
R5-GFP, mCherry-R5, and YFP-R5 have been shown to express FPs by fluorescence
microscopy (Figure S4). Emission maxima
of the GFP and YFP are relatively close (511 nm for GFPmut3 and 528
nm for Venus YFP),35,36 such that the same filter set
is used to visualize the fluorescence of both FPs. However, fluorescence
characteristics of these genetic constructs can be clearly discriminated
by fluorescence spectrometry.

2.2 Silica
Resin Purification of Hybrid Fluorescent
Proteins
Whole cell lysates of R5 peptide-conjugated FPs
were bound to the silica gel in buffer A, which was then washed to
remove unbound residues and loosely attached fusion proteins. Elution
was accomplished by a positively charged small molecule (1 M l-lysine in phosphate buffer) that replaces fusion proteins bound
to the resin. R5-tagged FPs bind to the resin with moderate affinity
(kd = 1.09 μM) and after repeated
washing steps (>10 resin volume), wash fractions do not yield a
qualitative
fluorescence signal (Figure 1B,C). The elution of fluorescence proteins was confirmed by
SDS-PAGE analysis. Gel bands corresponding to conjugate fluorescent
proteins were consistent with theoretical predictions (≈29
kDa) (Figure 1B, lower
gel).

His-tagged FPs for each FP were also designed to compare
the quality of the silica-binding tag. The proposed silica-binding
tag was outperformed by commercial Hispur cobalt resin in terms of
the purity calculated from total bands in the same lane. However,
improvements in the target band purity were comparable between cobalt
resin and silica tags (Table S4). Our data
suggests that the silica-binding tag approach can be useful for further
applications following protein purification. However, compared to
other highly specific purification techniques, the silica tag-based
approach needs to be improved if higher purity is needed. Resin retrieval
yields were calculated using protein concentrations before and after
the purification protocol. Yields from the Hispur cobalt resin were
around 10–12% for 6x-His-tagged FPs, whereas FP-R5 constructs
retrieved from the silica resin were with a yield of 15–18%.
Although the R5-based purification tag offers a higher purification
yield, the purity of the final eluate can be improved by adjusting
physicochemical conditions during protein elution. However, for our
purpose, in this study, purity of the fusion proteins is good enough
to induce silica formation, as can been seen from the silica particle
formation assays in Figures 1B and 3B.

2.3 Characterization
of FP-R5 Fusion Proteins
The binding strength and affinity
of silica nanoparticles to the
R5 peptide is measured quantitatively by QCM (quartz crystal microbalance)
(Figure 1D).37 Adsorption isotherms of the FP-R5 proteins were
recorded as a function of time. Correlations between the applied protein
concentrations to the sensor surface with resonance frequency shifts
show the strength of binding, predominantly resulting from the protein
itself (Figure 1D,
inset). Data collected from the QCM-D-binding experiments were utilized
to calculate the desorption constant (kd) of the YFP-R5 protein. The calculated desorption equilibrium constants
for the constructs can be found in Table 1. However, compared with the available desorption
constants of designer proteins for the formation of nanoparticles
in the literature,38 the values for our
proteins are moderate. QCM experiments were also conducted with other
R5 and His-tagged FPs (Figure S5, Table 1). Similar desorption
constants were found for other R5 constructs, whereas His-tagged FP
constructs resulted in a frequency change only at the highest protein
concentration and desorption constants were in the millimolar range.
As stated previously in the literature, proteins can control nanoparticle
formation kinetics and size by interacting with precursor molecules.39−41

2.4 In Vitro Silica Synthesis with Hybrid Fluorescence
Proteins
Silica nanoparticle synthesis was performed according
to the protocol suggested by Betancor et al.42 with slight modifications. Before silica nanoparticle synthesis,
fluorescent proteins that are encapsulated by silica (Figure 3A) exhibit similar excitation–emission
maxima with unmodified FPs (Figure 2A). Excitation–emission spectra were also analyzed
for His-tagged versions of FPs, excitation–emission peak wavelengths
of which deviated no more than 1 nm from their R5-tagged counterparts.
Excitation–emission pairs were expected to stay similar because
the covalently attached chromophore is embedded within the barrel-shaped
3D structure43 and the GS-linker provides
spatial freedom to the fusion partners to fold properly and independently.

characteristics of designer proteins. Left panel (A)
shows the excitation–emission spectra pairs for GFP-R5 (exc:
501 nm, emis: 509 nm), YFP-R5 (exc: 514 nm, emis: 527 nm), and mCherry-R5
(exc: 587 nm, emis: 610 nm) constructs. Right panel (B) shows time-resolved
fluorescence measurements and fluorescence decay characteristics for
GFP-R5, YFP-R5, and mCherry-R5 proteins before and after SiO2 encapsulation.

Some of the defining
characteristics of fluorescent materials are
their fluorescence decays and lifetimes, which are shown in Figure 2B. Encapsulation
into silica nanoparticles did not cause any obvious change in the
fluorescence lifetimes of the fusion proteins. The fluorescent lifetime
values are summarized in Table 2.

The silica nanoparticle
dispersity increases as the amount of protein
added to the solution decreases, as suggested by fluorescence microscopy
and SEM studies (Figures 3B and S6B). Initial
parameters used in silica nanoparticle synthesis resulted in agglomerated
particles of various sizes. Therefore, nanoparticle synthesis optimization
was necessary for efficient synthesis. Previously, the concentration
of ingredients and solution pH were used for the optimization of the
silica nanoparticle synthesis process.19 We decreased the concentration of TMOS added to the reaction mix
for YFP-R5 construct to one-fourth of the initial concentration and
observed that the number of freely formed silica nanoparticles, not
as in aggregates, was improved as a result (details of the TMOS-based
silica particle synthesis can be found in the Methods section). In addition, diluted reaction buffer was used to wash
the reaction solution to remove unreacted chemicals; therefore, we
have compared the single-washed reaction mixture with triple-washed
samples. The quality improved by additional washing but the concentration
of nanoparticles had decreased in each washing step, making additional
washing steps inadvisable. Therefore, three washing steps appear to
be adequate for improved quantity and yield.

silica particle synthesis by R5 peptide conjugated to fluorescent
proteins. Optimization of parameters (protein concentration, tetramethylorthosilicate
(TMOS) concentration, and washing of the unreacted species) for silica
nanoparticle synthesis, as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM)
imaging (B).

Synthesized particle
fluorescence was examined for all samples
involved in the optimization process, which exhibited similar particle
characteristics under electron microscopy. Higher protein concentrations
during the synthesis process result in the production of larger particles
(Figure S6A). Similar observations were
made previously.44,45 The particle size distribution
remains moderate (with a diameter of ∼100–200 nm) and
was similar across different designer protein concentrations (Figure S7). Proteins are expected to control
the growth of the nanoparticles by interacting with the precursors
and modulating the nucleation process. As the particles start to grow,
proteins are adsorbed on growing particles. This event prevents the
attachment of the additional seeds and precursor materials, resulting
in restricted growth of the final particles.46

However, in our case we observed that particles tend to grow
as
a function of protein concentrations. This may indicate that the proteins
are encapsulated within the particles instead of attaching to particle
surfaces and restricting their growth. Additional proteins induce
the formation of additional layers on preformed particles, as explained
in the model in Figure 3A. Fluorescence of silica particles is shown for each of the constructs
in Figure S8.

The particles that
are seen in the SEM and TEM images are in the
nanometer range (Figures 3B and 4). However, we may have caused
the partial aggregation of the particles during sample preparation,
as large structures containing nanoparticles have been observed under
SEM. When FP-R5 was not added to the reaction mix, silica nanostructures
were not visible (Figure S9). It is important
to note that the particle shape is not perfectly spherical, and we
observed a greater number of aggregates for unwashed samples: fluorescent
proteins used in this study are expected to be about 4.2 nm in length
and 2.5 nm in width, and surface roughness of the particles would
be in proportion with these values. Silica particles also tend to
form small aggregates, which may increase effective sizes.47−49

The particle origin has been shown by several methods. Energy
dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and energy filtering TEM (EFTEM) results
clearly show that silicon atoms are present in the synthesized particles
and atoms belonging to organic molecules (C, O, and N) have likewise
been observed for genetic construct-functionalized particles (Figure 4A,B). Fluorescence microscopy results support this trend (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The energy
spectrum shows other signal peaks that would be attributed to the
composition of the grid (in the case of Ni and Cu) or staining method
that is preferred (in the case of U and Mg).

2.5 Effects of the Silica Nanoparticles on Cell
Viability
One of the application areas for biodots is biomedical
imaging. In terms of imaging, cancer cells are good candidates to
test. The cell viability assay was performed to check the toxicity
values for the designed genetic constructs. MCF-10A is a normal human
breast cell line, whereas MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 are human breast
adenocarcinoma cell lines. The silica concentration was measured as
the total weight of the dried sample, neglecting the concentration
of proteins, which are about 4 orders of magnitude less than that
of silica. Results indicate that the nanoparticles do not exhibit
differences between normal and cancerous cell lines in terms of cellular
toxicity (Figure 5).
Overall, the toxicity was comparably low, whereas the effect of toxicity
was observed both visually and enzymatically only at the highest silica
concentration. Silica fluorescent particles designed in the present
study are generally smaller than the particles used to study toxicity
in the literature.50,51 Contamination by a lower variety
and concentration of chemicals would decrease the toxicity while decreasing
size, which could significantly contribute to the reactivity of silica
particles with subcellular components.

lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436) and normal breast cell line (MCF-10A).

Diatom frustules can be considered
as an inspiration for the development
of nanosized biohybrid materials. Their ability to synthesize silica
nanostructures at ambient conditions with great precision is still
unsolved, but many studies prove that the degree of control in diatom
silica biomineralization is intriguingly high. Coyle et al. and others
have previously shown that silica-binding tags can be used as an effective
protein purification tool.52 R5 tag facilitates
the purification of proteins without the need for other affinity tags
and thereby produces significantly less impurities after purification.
R5 peptide tag was used in two different operations as a bifunctional
system. The first is to elute the protein of interest from the vast
mixture of cellular extracts by utilizing the affinity of the tag
to silica. The second is to help the synthesis of silica micro/nanostructures
by nucleating hydrolyzed silica ions. It has been reported that sol–gel
processing silica is a convenient material for producing fluorescent
nanoparticles by the incorporation of organic dyes during production,
whereas the brightness and emission of organic dye molecules can be
enhanced for silica-based nanoparticles.53 During the design process of recombinant protein expression, the
strategy of elution should be carefully selected.54 Bifunctional tags help in the handling and increase the
speed and robustness of the whole process. Bifunctional tags are also
proposed to be utilized in various applications of silica in biotechnology,
such as carrier drug–gene delivery systems and biosensing.55,56 Fluorescent silica biodots can be utilized in biomedical applications
not only for imaging purposes but also can be designed as a drug and
gene carried with real-time monitoring capabilities. Given the wide
range applicability and biocompatibility of silica nano/microparticles,
biodots can find a wide range of applicability. The protein-based
nano/microparticle synthesis is a promising approach in terms of lower
toxicity, ease of tunability, and modularity.

3 Methods
3.1 Cloning of Fluorescent Proteins
GFP-R5
and R5-GFP fusion cassettes were produced by four successive PCRs
using GFPmut3 as a template. R5 peptide (H2N-SSKKSGSYSGSKGSKRRIL-CO2H) coding DNA sequence is added to the 3′ and 5′
end of the FP coding DNA sequences. GS flexible linkers are motifs
of glycine and serine that are used in varying numbers and allow the
separated folding of adjacent parts. Three repeats of GGGS were inserted
between the FPs and R5. PCR was performed using Q5 DNA polymerase
(NEB), and the reaction mix was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Primers are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Tm (melting
temperature) was calculated using IDT oligo analyzer software. The
PCR reaction setup is as follows: initial denaturation (98 °C,
30 s), 5 cycles of amplification for the primer-binding region of
DNA through denaturation (98 °C, 10 s), primer annealing (binding Tm, 30 s) and extension (72 °C, 30 s/kb),
30 cycles of amplification for the total primer length through denaturation
(98 °C, 10 s), primer annealing (total Tm, 30 s) and extension (72 °C, 30 s/kb), and final extension
for 5 min. The resulting amplicon and the vector were KpnI and MluI (NEB)-digested; gel was extracted and
ligated by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

To produce YFP-R5 and mCherry-R5 cassettes, E. coli codon-optimized R5 peptide-coding sequence
was artificially synthesized (Sentegen, Turkey). Each genetic part
was then PCR-amplified to include homologous regions. These parts
were then ligated into an anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible pZA
vector using the Gibson Assembly protocol.57 To amplify the DNA sequence of the YFP and mCherry, pZS2-123 plasmid
was utilized (Addgene #26598).58

Ligated plasmid constructs were then transformed into chemically
competent E. coli DH5α PRO strain
by the standard heat-shock transformation protocol. Colonies growing
on antibiotic agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol (35 μg/mL)
were chosen, and all FP-R5 constructs were verified by DNA sequencing
(Figure S2). Amino acid sequences of proteins
and nucleotide sequences of DNA are listed in Table S2.

3.2 Overexpression of the Fusion
Proteins
Following DNA sequence verification, E. coli DH5α PRO strains that contain FP-R5
expression constructs
were grown in low-salt lysogeny broth medium (tryptone 10 g/L, NaCl
5 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L) supplemented with chloramphenicol. At
an OD600 of 0.6, aTc (100 ng/mL) was added to each bacterial culture.
Following induction, the cultures were incubated for 8 h in a 30 °C
(20 °C for mCherry-R5) shaker at 200 rpm and the cultures were
then harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 15
min at 4 °C and suspended in extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, 2
mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH: 7.5). Total protein extraction
was performed by probe sonication for 5 min (10/10 s on/off regime).
Then, extracts were centrifuged at 15 000g for 1 h and the supernatant was retrieved for later use.

3.3 Purification of Tagged Proteins via Silica
Resin
The purification of R5-tagged proteins was performed
according to the protocol by Coyle et al.,52 with modifications. The silica gel matrix was prepared by washing
silica microspheres (Sigma) having the sizes of 60–220 mm with
protein extraction buffer. Protein extracts were incubated with the
silica gel overnight at 4 °C while being agitated, and the gel
was then washed several times with 10 mM l-lysine solution
in protein extraction buffer to remove excess R5-FPs and unbound solutes.
Elution was performed by adding 1 M l-lysine containing 2%
glacial acetic acid to the silica gel/total protein mixture. Elution
fractions were collected for SDS-PAGE gel analysis. Purified protein
concentrations were determined by bichinconinic acid assay (BCA, Pierce).
Bifunctional protein molecular weights and pI values were calculated
using ExPASy online tool (Table S3). 6x-His
tagged experimental control samples were purified by Hispur cobalt
resin (Thermo Scientific). Purified proteins were visualized by 10%
TGX SDS-PAGE using Mini-Protean Handcast System (Biorad). The purity
of SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to the fusion proteins were calculated
by quantification of protein bands by ImageJ program. Fold change
values were calculated as a ratio of purity of the target band in
the same lane, before and after the purification.

3.4 Silica Nanoparticle Synthesis
Chemical
synthesis of silica nanoparticles is generally achieved by modified
versions of the Stöber process.42 In this study, tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) was used as the silica
precursor and prepared as 1 M in ddH2O and 1 mM HCl is
added to hydrolyze the TMOS by stirring. Twenty five microliters of
200 μM eluted proteins are added to 0.1 M phosphate citrate
buffer (pH: 8), and 50 μL of 1 M TMOS is added slowly into the
reaction solution to bring the total volume to 1 mL. Then, resulting
mixtures are vortexed and washed several times with 0.025 M phosphate
citrate buffer (pH: 7.5) to remove unreacted ingredients. Resulting
solutions are then probe-sonicated for 5–10 min (10/10 s on/off
regime). Polyethyleneimine (10%) was used as a positive control.

FP-R5 protein-mediated silica nanoparticle synthesis is optimized
by changing the concentration of proteins used to induce the initialization
of silica nanoparticle formation. Serial dilutions of the proteins
are used to determine the optimal parameters for the successful synthesis
of FP-containing silica nanomaterial.

Concentrations of the
ingredients were optimized for efficient
and stable synthesis of the nanomaterials. Nanomaterial synthesis
protocols generally suggest addition of ingredients at low rates usually
by help of a peristaltic pump. In our case, we added TMOS in five
equal volume shots (5 × 10 μL) to increase particle quality.59

3.5 Fluorescence Measurements
To detect
potential shifts in the peak values or emergence of new peaks of fluorescence
excitations and emissions of purified recombinant fluorescent proteins,
iterative excitation and emission scanning is performed. Spectral
data has been collected for those optimized wavelengths using fluorescence
spectrometry (Agilent Cary Eclipse).

Samples were prepared on
glass slides for fluorescence microscopy imaging. GFP-R5, R5-GFP,
and YFP-R5 were visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Scope A1
Zeiss, Germany). Approximately 10–15 μL of samples were
dropped on a microscopy glass slide and covered with a coverslip.
Filter sets were chosen according to the excitation–emission
pairs for each of the FPs. fs20 is selected for detecting red fluorescence,
whereas fs38 was chosen for green and yellow fluorescence.

Fluorescence
lifetimes and decay kinetics were measured by time-resolved
fluorescence analysis (Pico-quant, Germany). Emission wavelengths
of FPs were previously determined by fluorescence spectrometry data.
Fluorescent decay tail fit was performed by Fluofit software.

3.6 Quartz Crystal Microbalance Experiments
Quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D)
quartz sensors were purchased from Biolin Scientific, Sweden. The
sensors were cleaned by UV–ozone and 2% SDS treatment according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sensor surfaces were prewashed
with 1× PBS for 1 h. Protein samples were prepared in 1×
PBS solution at concentrations of 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 nM
and administered from the lowest to highest concentration. After each
protein administration, 1× PBS washing was performed until frequency
change values reached a plateau. Measurements were performed in the
Q-sense QCM explorer equipment. The data selected for calculations
was from three consecutive overtone orders n = 3,
5, and 7. The Langmuir equilibrium model was utilized to estimate
the adsorption characteristics of the FPs to the silica sensor surface.
In this model, frequency change is related to the desorption strength
by the equation Δf = (fmax x C)/(kd + C), where C is the concentration of the
protein. fmax value was estimated by the
Langmuir isotherm, and kd value was determined
by least squares fitting accordingly.38

3.7 Cellular Toxicity of Fluorescent Silica Particles
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and MCF-10A cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured
in 100 mm Petri dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential
amino acids was used for culturing of the cells. To examine the effect
of silica particles on cell viability, cells were seeded (6000 cells/well)
in 96-well plates with 100 μL of media. Silica particle treatment
was performed 24 h after seeding. Five silica particle concentrations
were prepared with serial dilutions (10-fold per dilution) for toxicity
experiments. Four replicates were used for each condition. Following
treatment, cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability Kit was used to examine the
effect of the particles on cell viability. At the end of the 72 h
silica particle incubation period, cells were removed from the incubator
and incubated at room temperature along with CellTiter-Glo reagent
for 30 min. After reaching the temperature equilibrium, CellTiter-Glo
reagent was administered to each well in a volume of 30 μL.
Then, the plate was placed on a shaker for 10 min to facilitate cell
lysis. Finally, medium–reagent mixture from each 96-well plate
was transferred to corresponding wells of opaque white flat bottom
96-well plates, and the luminescence signal was measured using Biotek
Microplate reader.

3.8 Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM
studies were performed either with unmodified silicon wafers or 40
μm of gold deposited by thermal evaporation on glass substrates.
A microliter of the 1× PBS-washed sample was drop cast on the
surface and air-dried for 30 min. Samples were then sputter-coated
with gold–palladium to obtain small grain sizes for high-resolution
images. The thin-film coating thickness was around 3–5 nm.
Thin-film coating significantly reduces electron energy absorption-related
burns (charging) on the sample. SEM (FEI Quanta) images were taken
at varying forward voltages for electron energy (5–20 keV).

3.9 Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM studies
were conducted to visualize the particles at a higher
magnification. Fifteen microliters of samples were put on a parafilm
surface, and an EMS Ni grid with formvar/C support (300 mesh) was
placed on the sample with the carbon-coated surface facing the sample.
After 1 min of incubation, excess fluid that is adhered to the surface
was removed by letting the side of the grid touch a tissue paper.
Three rounds of distilled deionized water cleaning were performed.
Samples were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s to improve the
image contrast. The samples were then analyzed on TEM (FEI Tecnai).
TEM electron acceleration power was 200 keV. Energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was also performed to identify material
composition (EDAX).
