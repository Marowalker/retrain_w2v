An environmentally
benign highly atom-economic protocol for the
construction of the C–C bond has been developed under catalyst-
and solvent-free conditions. This protocol involves the efficient
coupling of 2-methyl quinazolinones with isatin for the highly diastereoselective
access of schizocommunin derivatives in excellent yields (up to 97%).
Furthermore, the preliminary cytotoxicity screening of selected schizocommunin
analogues displayed promising anticancer activity against human cancer
cell lines, and the cytotoxic potential of active compound 12ac was also validated by in silico molecular docking simulation studies.

Introduction
C–H
bond functionalization via direct coupling strategy
and installing a new C–C bond is considered as an attractive
research area in organic synthesis.1 Development
of such methodologies not only facilitates the sustainable requirement
of organic transformations but also found omnipresent applications
in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex natural products.2 Over the years, the transition-metal-catalyzed C–H bond functionalization via simple coupling
reaction gained significant attention and several promising catalytic
systems have been developed,3 but the apparent
drawbacks cannot be ignored anymore. This includes, high cost for
the catalyst synthesis, severe toxicity of the metal salts, anhydrous
conditions, and toxic solvents. In contrast, an eco-friendly coupling
under metal-free condition is still scarce.4

Natural products have been widely demonstrated to be the rich
source
of bioactive lead compounds according to their potential biological
activity, good structural diversity, and compatibility with the environment
and nontoxic potential.5 Because of the
versatile application in medicinal chemistry as well as in allied
fields, the construction of natural products and their analogues with
the direct coupling strategy without using any toxic metals has always
been a keen research area for organic and medicinal chemists and in
great demand.5d

Additionally, there
has been a paradigm shift from traditional
organic chemistry to the one that assigns green chemistry values.
Various simple metrics that include the principles of green chemistry
such as atom economy, step economy, mass intensity, and E factors
are essential parameters to the sustainable development of organic
chemistry.6 Moreover, the replacement or
complete removal of hazardous solvents and catalysts in chemical transformations
has required urgent attention by chemists toward the synthesis of
active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In this context, the organic
reactions without hazardous solvents, metal catalysts, and additives
can eliminate the contamination of APIs as well as it can curb the
environmental pollution.7 Therefore, considering
the potential of the greener approach in organic synthesis, the development
of new strategies via improving the atom economy of chemical processes
and simple and efficient coupling under solvent- and catalyst-free
approach for the construction of natural products and their analogues
is a challenging task and are in great demand.

Schizocommunin
is a natural product isolated from liquid culture
medium of Schizophyllum commune strain and exhibits significant cytotoxic
activity against murine lymphoma cells.8a The biological studies on schizocommunin and its synthetic analogues
were less explored because of the lesser availability from natural
resources. Chemically, the revised structure of schizocommunin 1 comprises 2-substituted quinazolinone connected by exomethylene-linked
oxindole skeleton (Figure 1).8b On the other hand, the functionalized
quinazolinones are present in several bio-active natural products.9 Amongst the quinazolinone class of bioactive
compounds, the 2-substituted quinazolinone-based natural products
such as schizocommunin,8c piriqualone,10a isaindigotone,10b CP-465022,10c ipsinesib,10d idelalisib,10e balaglitazone,10f asperlicin C,10g and benzomalvin A10h (Figure 1) have attracted considerable
interest because of their broad spectrum of biological activities.
The syntheses of schizocommunin and its analogues via direct functionalization
at the 2-position in quinazolinones were previously reported but these
methodologies have apparent drawbacks, such as acid solvents, toxic
catalysts, tedious reaction setup, recovery of intermediates, and
purification process.8b,8c Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop a direct, metal free, environmentally benign route
to access the schizocommunin analogues along with avoidance of the
aforementioned drawbacks. Herein, as a continuation of our ongoing
interest in the development of a “green and sustainable”
novel catalytic methodology for biologically privileged heterocycles,11 we wish to disclose an efficient, eco-friendly
direct approach to access the schizocommunin analogues under catalyst-
and solvent-free conditions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first report of the environmentally benign scalable approach for the
efficient construction of schizocommunin analogues under catalyst-
and solvent-free simple conventional heating conditions.

and other 2-substituted quinazolinone-based natural
products and bio-active molecules.

Results and Discussion
With an intention to obtain schizocommunin
derivative 12a under the environmentally benign approach,
the precursor 10a was first synthesized and screened
the catalytic activity of different
acid catalysts for the C–C bond formation. All the results
are summarized in Table 1. In an initial attempt, 10a and 11a were
used as model substrates for the screening of various Brønsted
as well as Lewis acids in eco-friendly solvents EtOH, ethylene glycol,
and water. However, acids used in the reaction did not give promising
results and the isolated yields of desired schizocommunin derivative 12a were poor (<30%, entries 1–8, Table 1). Moving toward greener acid
catalysts, that is boric acid, and greener solvents like ethylene
glycol as well as water did not give promising results (entries 9–11, Table 1). We further continued
our screening under catalyst- and solvent-free conditions, but the
result was not improved (entry 13, Table 1). However, when we increased the temperature
to 140 °C, surprisingly, we obtained the product 12a in higher amounts (53%) compared to other previous conditions (entry
14, Table 1). Therefore,
we further performed a set of the reaction under solvent- and catalyst-free
conditions at elevated temperatures (entries 15–18, Table 1). To our delight,
on only increasing the reaction temperature and time, the better yield
of desired product 12a was obtained (yield = 93%, entry
16, Table 1). Further
increasing or decreasing the reaction time diminishes the yield of 12a (entries 17–18, Table 1). Therefore, the reaction of 10a with 11a at 180 °C under solvent- and catalyst-free
conditions for 6 h was the optimized eco-friendly reaction condition
for the synthesis of schizocommunin derivative 12a (entry
16, Table 1). It is
important to note that purity of the product 12a was
high enough for the direct spectroscopic analysis without any further
purification. In general, reaction temperature is crucial to directly
influence the molten condition and for the uniformity of the reactants
under solvent-free conditions. Thus, the solvent-free coupling of 10a with 11a in an equimolar ratio under elevated
temperature offers an efficient eco-friendly approach to synthesize
functionalized schizocommunin analogues. It is important to note that,
reaction is highly diastereoselective having exclusive formation of
the (E)-isomer and this stereochemistry was well
confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 12a and 12c (Figure 2).

of 12a (CCDC-1902044) and 12c (CCDC-1893810)

Next, we started exploring the scope of the reaction using various
substituted quinazolinones and isatins under the optimized reaction
conditions (Table 2). Isatins bearing electron-withdrawing functional groups such as
CN, Cl, Br, COCH3, and CF3 afforded corresponding
products 12a–12ae in almost quantitative yields
(up to 97%). It is notable that the iodo-functionality also survived
in the optimized reaction conditions (12ab) and provides
further possibilities of the diversification, which otherwise would
be challenging by the transition-metal-catalyzed methodologies. The
overall yields were excellent in all the cases and no column chromatography
was required for the purification of the schizocommunin derivatives
(12a–12ae).

Additionally, various green chemistry parameters were
investigated
and demonstrated by the green assessment diagram for the synthesis
of schizocommunin derivatives (Figure 3). Our developed methodology has remarkable advantages
in terms of several green parameters, for example, atom economy of
the synthesis of 12a was reached 96.51%; carbon efficiency
of the reaction was 100%; reaction mass efficiency was observed up
to 89.74%; and most importantly the E-factor was
reduced to 0.11 (Figure 3). Besides aforementioned improvements in the synthesis of schizocommunin
derivatives, no need of the purification by column chromatography
was the additional advantage associated with the developed method.

derivative synthesis.

Because of the potential cytotoxicity profile of the natural
product
schizocommunin against murine lymphoma cells,8,9 it
was anticipated that the analogues of schizocommunin would display
promising cytotoxic activity. Thus, the selected synthesized Schizocommunin
analogues were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against three
human cancer cell lines, that is, A549 (lung cancer), MCF-7 (breast
cancer), and PC-3 (prostate cancer) using an azolium-based colorimetric
cytotoxicity assay (MTT assay).12 Compounds 12i, 12p, 12ac, and 12ae exhibited above 50% cytotoxicity at 10 μM concentration. These
compounds were further selected to evaluate concentration-dependent
responses and displayed promising antiproliferative activity with
IC50 values ranging from 3.21 ± 0.21 to 14.56 ±
0.17 μM (Table 3). The compound 12ac displayed significant antiproliferative
activity against all the screened cancer cell lines. This exciting
preliminary antiproliferative activity profile of this series of schizocommunin
analogues further opens a new way to get a novel drug lead in cancer
treatment.

In order to understand the mechanism of anticancer activity of
the inhibitor (12ac), molecular docking study was performed
on the protein structure of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) enzyme
(Figure 4).13a,13b Prior docking, the molecular structure of the ligand 12ac was energy minimized with the aid of the MMFF94x force field to
attain the low-energy conformation. The free energy binding score
of the compound 12ac was −6.99 kcal/mol and was
very close to the binding energy value (−8.19 kcal/mol) of
the reference drug sunitinib. An analysis of protein–ligand
interactions showed that the −C=O group and nitrogen
atoms in the quinazolin-4(3H)-one and oxoindolin-3-ylidene
moieties are strongly interacted electrostatically with the acidic
and basic amino acid domains of Glu8, Asp86, Lys88, Gln131, Lys9,
Lys20, Lys89, and Gly11. The 3-chlorobenzyl group at the quinazolin-4(3H)-one ring interacted by means of hydrophobic domains of
Leu134, Leu298, Val18, Phe82, Ala31, and Leu83. The benzyl moiety
and 5-chlorophenyl at 2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene moieties are completely
exposed to the solvent area of the protein. This indicated that, such
types of projective groups are not important for the inhibition of
the CDK2 enzyme. This study strongly demonstrated the key features
responsible for the inhibitory activity as well as design of analogues
against the CDK2 target.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
described an environmentally benign, straightforward
access for the synthesis of diastereoselective schizocommunin derivatives
in the absence of catalyst and solvent in excellent yields. The advantages
of the developed methodology are experimental simplicity, easy work-up,
and excellent yields of products. Additionally, the product isolation
does not require purification by column chromatography. This eco-friendly
methodology also eliminates toxic metal catalyst-related environmental
hazards and pollutions along with increase in atomic economy. Furthermore,
the preliminary cytotoxic activity of selected compounds revealed
that the promising cytotoxic profile in A549, MCF-7, and PC-3 human
cancer cell lines. The in silico molecular docking simulation studies
of compound 12ac effectively validated the in vitro experimental
results and worthy of further structural optimization for the development
in the anticancer drug discovery process.

Experimental Section
General
All reactions were carried out in oven- or
flame-dried glassware unless otherwise noted. Except as otherwise
indicated, all reactions were magnetically stirred and monitored by
analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using precoated silica
gel glass plates (0.25 mm) with the F254 indicator. Visualization
was accomplished by UV light (254 nm). Column chromatography was performed
using a silica gel 100–200 mesh. Yields refer to pure compounds,
unless otherwise noted. Commercial grade reagents and solvents were
used without further purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
using CDCl3/DMSO-d6 as a solvent
for deuterium locking with temperature 298 K. Chemical shifts are
given in ppm with TMS as an internal reference. J values are given
in Hertz. High-resolution mass spectra were determined with a quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
