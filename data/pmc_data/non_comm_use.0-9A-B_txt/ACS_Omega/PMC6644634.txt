There is strong demand for achieving
morphological control of conducting
polymers in its many potential applications, from energy harvesting
to spintronics. Here, the static magnetic-field-induced alignment
of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
particles is demonstrated. PEDOT:PSS thin films cast under modest
mT-level magnetic fields exhibit a fourfold increase in the Seebeck
coefficient and doubled electrical conductivity. Atomic force microscopy
measurements confirm the presence of conducting islands that exhibit
a 10-fold increase in the local charge carrier mobility and threshold
behavior that is associated with phase separation. High-resolution
scanning electron microscopy identifies a consistent structural coil-to-rod
transition, and three-dimensional time-of-flight secondary-ion mass
spectrometry imaging shows that the rodlike structures coincide with
PEDOT domains that generally align with the magnetic field and cluster
on the outer surface. Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering,
Raman spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance, and circular dichroism
spectroscopy point to the physical nature of the magnetophoretic alignment,
which is expected to occur via magnetic coupling of PEDOT domains
with polaron modes. Because casting under mT-level magnetic fields
increases the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:PSS
thin films without additional dopants that commonly limit the thermoelectric
performance, our research reveals that low-field magnetophoresis significantly
influences the structure and corresponding physical properties of
PEDOT:PSS. Our results also point to concerns that the presence of
small external magnetic fields in laboratory settings may appreciably
and inadvertently influence the PEDOT:PSS morphology during settling,
drying, or annealing processes.

Introduction
Conducting polymers (CPs) have attracted
extensive attention as
thermoelectric materials for low-grade waste heat recovery because
of their low intrinsic thermal conductivity,1 large-area solution processability, and low processing cost for
device fabrication. The mechanical toughness, flexibility, and elasticity
of CPs point to an exciting range of heat-recovering applications
for both soft and lightweight electronic devices. Moreover, CPs offer
new routes to optimize thermoelectric efficiency2 because they are not limited by the Wiedemann–Franz
law that dominates for inorganic materials, namely, that correlation
between electrical and thermal conductivities are weak.3 Among CPs, significant attention is focused on
poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT), which shows a relatively
high thermoelectric figure of merit.4 The
polymerization of PEDOT using the water-soluble polyelectrolyte poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PSS) facilitates the formation of a stable, aqueous dispersion
of colloidal polymer particles, which has further advantages: in the
colloid form, CPs may be inexpensively processed with industry-ready
large-area methods such as inkjet printing, silkscreening, and spin-coating
in ambient air.2,5,6 Moreover,
the processing of PEDOT:PSS in aqueous dispersions avoids the environmental
issues associated with volatile chemical emissions from organic solvents.7 Deeper understanding of the aggregation and phase
separation of PEDOT:PSS is necessary to improve the control of colloid-to-bulk
material properties for future polymer technologies.

Although
commercial PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersions are widely used,
challenges remain in optimizing charge transport in solid-state structures.
In PEDOT:PSS, electrical charges hop between the PEDOT-rich phases
across the insulating PSS phase8 so that
high variability in the processed morphology and physical properties
of PEDOT:PSS leads to high variability in the electrical behavior.9,10 Solvent additives and film post-treatment with secondary dopants
have been shown to improve the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS
by aligning PEDOT centers.1,11−13 However, this approach also decreases the effective Seebeck coefficient
of the resulting CP.14 In order to enhance
both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, top-down approaches
involving serial processes and advanced microprocessing methods, such
as etching and photolithography, have been employed.15,16

Here, we show that the alignment and aggregation of PEDOT:PSS
particles
are influenced by the presence of low-level magnetic fields and that
the magnetophoresis coincides with dramatic increases of the electrical
conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and PEDOT:PSS paramagnetic response.
The low-level magnetic-field-induced alignment that is demonstrated
here improves the physical properties of PEDOT:PSS, with the improvement
being greater than that previously reported using secondary dopants.
Along with the problems associated with the instability of the doping
level, secondary dopants lead to a trade-off relationship between
conductivity and Seebeck coefficient because the high doping levels
move the Fermi level closer to the conduction band edge, thus reducing
transport energy of charge carriers;14 as
a result, the population of charged carriers increases, whereas the
average mobility decreases, resulting in a net decrease in the Seebeck
coefficient. As an alternative to secondary dopants, magnetic assembly
has been observed with high-level magnetic fields in PEDOT17 and block copolymers.18 The magnetophoresis of CPs remains underexplored; even though there
is good understanding of the paramagnetic centers of PEDOT, morphological
control with low-level magnetophoresis has not been studied.

Our results show an unusually low threshold for observing the onset
of magnetophoresis: mT-strength magnetic fields lead to morphological
changes in PEDOT:PSS that are identified by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)
imaging, which coincide with a dramatic fourfold increase in the Seebeck
coefficient and doubling of the electrical conductivity. We verify
that the magnetophoresis arises from a paramagnetic response measured
by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and show that the change
in morphology coincides with enhanced circular dichroism (CD) in the
plane of the substrate or film, which may be useful in monitoring
the changes in the nanocrystal morphology. The PEDOT:PSS colloids
in films exhibit CD at oblique incidence to a larger degree after
the films are prepared in magnetic fields. Our results not only show
that applied magnetic field alters the spatial distributions of PEDOT
and PSS but also suggest that the magnetophoretic alignment may occur
via coupling of the paramagnetic moments of PEDOT centers because
of the presence of polarons on PEDOT backbones. This investigation
provides initial data, demonstrating critical properties to be further
explored. Our work may be relevant to the magnetophoretic crystallization
that is observed with organic materials and proteins.19

Results
Thin films prepared under magnetic fields perpendicular
to the
film surface (“surface-perpendicular”) exhibit through-plane
agglomeration of PEDOT phases and dispersed rodlike PEDOT phases (Figure 1). The thin films
prepared under magnetic fields parallel to the film surface (“surface-parallel”)
are also composed of rodlike PEDOT phases. However, with surface-parallel
samples, the PEDOT rod phases are generally concentrated on the top
surface and substrate surface. SEM images of the top surface show
that in the absence of a magnetic field, PEDOT:PSS is composed of
amorphous grains, which are replaced with rodlike structures when
the thin films are exposed to magnetic fields of a few mT (Figure 1). Substrate-parallel
samples are composed of rodlike PEDOT phases that are aligned in the
direction of the applied magnetic fields under which the samples are
dried. Substrate-perpendicular samples also exhibit rod patterns;
however, in these samples, as could be expected by symmetry, the PEDOT
phases appear dendritic from the top view and randomly dispersed.
On the basis of coarse inspection of 100 imaged locations and 20 samples,
the rodlike structures are approximately 5–10 μm in length.
Moreover, on the outer surface, the presence of the rodlike phases
appears to be as prominent in the substrate-perpendicular samples
as in the substrate-parallel samples. Figure 1c,e is representative of the surface of the
exposed film, though moderate variations in dendritic and random patterns
appear across substrate-perpendicular samples.

Figure 1 Experimental setup with
deposited PEDOT:PSS (blue) showing control
samples heated on a Peltier module and substrate-perpendicular and
substrate-parallel alignments of the magnetic field. In three-dimensional
(3D) TOF-SIMS images (300 × 300 × 4 μm3), the fragments of PEDOT [red, molecular weight (MW) = 41] are distinguished
from the PSS and indium tin oxide (ITO) coating (green, MW = 115).
SEM micrographs depict morphology of the top surface.

The surface morphology correlates with experimentally
measured
changes in the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS. We analyze the
directionality of in-plane charge transport across the thin films
by measuring the Seebeck coefficient S and conductivity
σ as a function of θ (Figure 2). That is, we compare the direction of the
electrical conductivity and thermoelectric effect as it relates to
the direction of the applied magnetic field. The S of 10 μV K–1 for control samples is consistent
with values reported by previous groups.21 Higher magnetic fields produce higher measured values in both S and σ, as indicated by the colormap that distinguishes
values measured for samples cast under 10 and 20 mT. Our experiments
are limited by the strength of the magnetic fields produced by a Helmholtz
coil. When a PEDOT:PSS sample is dried adjacent to a permanent magnet
with a maximum magnetic field of B = 1 T, we subsequently
measure values of S ≈ 100 μV K–1. Unfortunately, because the magnetic field from the permanent magnet
is not uniform across the sample, we are not able to correlate the
parallel and perpendicular components of the magnetic field with the
anisotropy induced in the measured values of the samples.

Figure 2 Electrical
conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) as a function of measurement angle on the sample θ
(deg) for (a,b) substrate-perpendicular and (c,d) substrate-parallel
samples. In the substrate-parallel case, θ = 90° and θ
= 270° correspond to electrical measurements in the direction
of the applied magnetic fields.

For substrate-parallel samples, we consistently measure peak
values
in S and σ when the thermoelectric and electrical
measurements are aligned in the direction of the applied B-field or at θ = 90° and θ = 270° (Figure 2). For substrate-perpendicular
samples, as expected, the measured values of S and
σ do not depend significantly on θ. We did not measure
the samples at other angles regularly because the thermoelectric measurements
appear to be sensitive to sample geometry. At measurement angles of
θ = 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°, or corner-to-corner
angles, the measured values of S and σ on substrate-perpendicular
samples appear slightly higher than the control but the uncertainty
in these measurements is considerably larger. We attribute the larger
error bars for corner-to-corner measurements to drying dynamics, as
colloidal PEDOT:PSS drop-cast on glass tends to form deposits around
the edges and corners of a sample.22

Positive polarons or bipolarons present in the samples are the
sources of the EPR signal.23,24 The narrower part of
the control spectrum may be attributed to the presence of spinless
bipolarons. The presence of 1/2 spin polarons in magnetic-field-treated
PEDOT:PSS causes the broader line shape. These EPR measurements show
that substrate-perpendicular samples have the highest radical concentration.
The g values of ∼2.0038 ± 1 obtained
for the samples here (Figure 3a) are comparable to those measured in previous studies done
on PEDOT:PSS. The line width (Bpp) of
the control sample is found to be 6 Gauss which increases to ∼17
Gauss for magnetically treated samples. The EPR intensity (Figure 3b) is proportional
to the corresponding radical concentrations. Through normalization
with a standard 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl/toluene
sample containing a known number of spins, the radical concentrations
(spins/g) are computed. The radical concentration of PEDOT:PSS is
larger for samples fabricated within the magnetic field (Table 1). We ascribe EPR
differences to the changes of the thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS.

The enhanced paramagnetic response shown in the EPR
spectra is
consistent with the CD measurements, where magnetically aligned films
exhibit enhanced CD associated with polarons on the PEDOT backbone
(Figure 3c–e).
The control samples exhibit appreciable CD of one handedness when
samples are tilted at 45° to the incident light. The magnitude
of the CD at 45° increases by almost 30% with surface-parallel
and surface-perpendicular samples. At normal incidence for the control
samples, the CD is negligible. In contrast, there is a consistent
and non-negligible CD at normal incidence with the magnetically treated
samples, which is larger for the surface-perpendicular samples. The
CD measurements indicate that PEDOT:PSS exhibits a handedness, which
is intrinsic to the PEDOT:PSS polarons, and as such, the CD signal
is only subtly enhanced after fabrication under magnetic fields. We
expect that the PEDOT backbones disentangle and rearrange to form
rods under the magnetic field, undergoing a coil-to-rod transition
of PEDOT while preserving the helicity of the PSS moiety. Circularly
polarized light does not fully couple into the handedness when light
is directed perpendicular to the rods, evidenced by the significantly
enhanced CD signal when the sample is tilted from normal incidence.
It appears that a small portion of the rods may also be perpendicular
to the substrate because there is non-negligible CD in the samples
at normal incidence.

The mechanisms pinpointed by EPR and CD
are physical in nature,
as the Raman peaks do not shift for magnetically treated samples (Figure 4a). Rather, the magnetic
fields affect the orientation and arrangement of the molecules, but
not their chemical bonds or molecular structures. Grazing-incidence
small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is used to measure the structural
order averaged over wide film areas. The GIWAXS scattering patterns
exhibit several scattering features characteristic for PEDOT:PSS (Figure 4b–d),21,25 including a diffuse isotropic rings at q ≈
1.8 Å–1, that is ascribed to the chain packing
distance (aromatic ring stacking of PSS at q ≈
1.3 Å–1, and PEDOT at q ≈
1.7 Å–1), and broad peaks oriented out-of-plane
(qz ≈ 0.3 Å–1) arising from lamellar ordering. The scattering patterns
for control and magnetically ordered materials are broadly similar,
with minor intensity variations that are roughly similar to the intensity
variation that was measured on nominally identical samples. The variation
in overall scattering intensity likely arises from small differences
in sample preparation (e.g., film thickness) or sample measurement
(e.g., the grazing-incidence alignment). The features within scattering
patterns, including peak positions and angular distributions, are
nearly identical for control and magnetically ordered samples, suggesting
broadly similar structural ordering in these different samples. We
note that GIWAXS measures the overall/average molecular structural
order, and the signal is thus dominated by the preponderant structural
motif. In combination with the results presented above, this suggests
that the role of the magnetic field is to reorder the microscale morphology
of the material (as imaged by TOF-SIMS) without significantly altering
the local molecular packing motifs (as probed by GIWAXS).

samples.

Although chemical and morphological
differences between control
and magnetically treated samples appear subtle, the electrical mobility
of the conducting agglomerations is dramatically elevated in the magnetically
treated samples (Figure 5). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) current maps indicate that the maximum
current for a fixed bias voltage is 10 times greater for the magnetically
treated samples (Figure 5). The AFM-measured enhanced conductivities, measured perpendicular
to the PEDOT:PSS film, are consistent with the enhanced two-point
probe measurements made along the film surface (Figure 2).

Figure 5 AFM topography maps, current maps at a bias
voltage of 3 V, and I–V curves
for elevated particles/aggregations
in yellow squares. In all samples, the I–V plots are not retraced when the voltage is swept right
(blue) and left (red).

AFM measurements also point to nonlinear electrical behavior
of
the PEDOT:PSS samples, which warrant further study (Figure 5). The local through-plane
charge carrier behavior of the PEDOT-rich phases is shown. The I–V curves are dependent on the
direction of the swept voltage bias, and the behavior is also distinctly
different for magnetically treated PEDOT:PSS. The magnetically treated
samples exhibit breakdown behavior characteristic to p–n junctions,
whereas the control samples exhibit linear I–V characteristics that are resilient to breakdown. For the
magnetically treated samples, the breakdown voltage is different depending
on the direction swept. We expect that the strong threshold behavior
in the magnetically treated samples is associated with phase separation
of conducting PEDOT and insulating PSS domains. The electrical current
is expected to simultaneously produce and be influenced by the paramagnetic
response.

Discussion and Summary
We anticipate that the imaged
rodlike microscale PEDOT domains
correspond to the conformal coil-to-rod transition, phase separation,
and aggregation of PEDOT:PSS via magnetophoresis. The PEDOT microstructures
coincide with increased values of S and σ on
the outer surface, particularly when the rodlike formations are aligned
in the direction of measurement. However, our results may not be surprising
because other groups have observed a magnetophoretic effect coinciding
with enhancements of the electrical conductivity, only at higher field
strengths (>0.5 T).26 Magnetic assembly
has also been demonstrated by the template approach with iron oxide
nanoparticles.27

We anticipate that
there are two stages of the magnetic field on
the assemblies of polymer particles. In one stage, which is more established
and more easily understood, polymer complexes respond to the applied
magnetic field because of their paramagnetic susceptibilities derived
from polarons. The PEDOT:PSS phases align and migrate in order to
minimize their energy E = −μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment of the dipole and B is the magnetic flux density. Indeed, the molar paramagnetic
susceptibility of PEDOT:PSS is small but significant and has been
estimated with EPR to be 6.0 × 10–3 emu mol–1.28

In another stage,
PEDOT:PSS reduces its polymeric magnetoresistance
and energy via changes in shape/morphology. Previous groups have proposed
that the electronic origin of nT-level changes in magnetoresistance
in PEDOT:PSS stems from the electronic structure and electron-reaction
pathways.29,30 Our hypothesis is that the excitation of
paramagnetic polarons leads the originally curled polymer colloid
to become elongated and rodlike. Because of the delocalization of
electrons along π-orbitals, the planar backbones PEDOT cause
PEDOT:PSS complexes to behave more rodlike during structural rearrangements
than traditional polymers, which often behave as flexible coils.31,32 With AFM current maps of the outer surface, we verify that the rodlike
formations observed under SEM exhibit reduced magnetoresistance by
an order of magnitude.

It is valuable to compare the measured S and σ
values of substrate-parallel and substrate-perpendicular samples in
the context of the imaged rodlike formations. The prominence of rod
structures on the outer surface is greater in surface-parallel than
in surface-perpendicular samples, and the rod alignment direction
varies appreciably. In surface-parallel samples, the rods align in
the in-plane on the outer surface and appear randomly dispersed in
the bulk, whereas in surface-perpendicular samples, the rods align
in the through-plane and form random and dendritic patterns on the
outer surface. By symmetry, we expect that if thin films would carry
the same composition of anisotropic rodlike PEDOT domains whose conductivity
was solely determined by the rod alignment, then substrate-parallel
samples and substrate perpendicular samples should exhibit the same
average values of S and σ across all angles.
However, this is not the case: values of S and σ
in the surface-perpendicular samples are lower than expected, suggesting
that the dendritic assemblies of PEDOT rods suppress in-plane hopping
mechanisms and charge transport. It is not only the direction of the
rodlike domains that determine macroscopic electrical properties but
also their relative clustering and network across the top surface.

The high anisotropy of the Seebeck coefficient due to domain orientation
does not contradict findings of previous groups. Although the Mott
equation suggests that the Seebeck coefficient is independent of grain
orientation,33 the Seebeck coefficient
shows substantial spatial dependence in anisotropic systems of gold
nanowires,34 bismuth telluride,35 and tin selenide.36 For conjugated polymers, charge mobility is highest along the chain
direction and the π-stacking direction and negligible along
the alkyl side chains. When the semiconducting backbone aligns with
the magnetic field, mobility is suppressed perpendicular to the backbone
in the direction of the insulating alkyl side chains. Furthermore,
for substrate-parallel samples, the rodlike PEDOT domains in the in-plane
direction may lead to a carrier localization length larger than the
molecular spacing, which would result in a high in-plane conductivity.

Evidence of the conformational changes in shape/morphology is supported
by the increased spin concentration and excitation and shown in EPR,
CD, and AFM measurements. Our experimental PEDOT:PSS samples exhibit
broadly negative CD at non-normal incidence, which is derived from
the polaron band and the partially coiled or helical structure of
PEDOT:PSS.37,38 We expect that the CD is only
visible at non-normal angles of incidence because the polymer rods
are aligned largely parallel to the plane of the substrate; therefore,
in order to excite the polarons and tune into the handedness of the
PSS moiety, light needs to illuminate the sample at an oblique angle.
With magnetically treated samples, we observe a stronger CD measurement,
indicating that strong paramagnetic polarons on the PEDOT chains are
excited. AFM I–V measurements
point to nonlinear electrical behavior of the PEDOT:PSS samples associated
with the mobility-coupled paramagnetic response and PEDOT:PSS phase
separation, which warrant further study.

SEM, TOF-SIMS, and
GIWAXS data indicate that the low-level magnetic
fields induce the strongest morphological changes at the surface of
the polymer thin film. The structural ordering of conducting PEDOT
domains observed under SEM appears to be concentrated on the top surface
from the 3D TOF-SIMS images. The complementary GIWAXS measurements
average over the entire film thickness. The strong similarity of GIWAXS
data for control and magnetically ordered samples suggests that the
changes in molecular packing induced by a magnetic field are small
compared to the bulk ordering. The results indicate that the magnetophoresis
takes effect from the outside and propagates inward. Magnetophoresis
with CPs may occur more readily in the absence of surface pinning
effects, when viscosity is lower, or when the colloidal diffusion
is higher. Further research into the magnetophoretic spatiotemporal
dynamics may provide new approaches for large-area nanostructuring
and microstructuring of PEDOT:PSS.

It is important for us to
mention that we conducted experiments
at a variety of temperatures with different home-made Helmholtz coils
and comparable-temperature control samples. Given that similar morphological
effects are observed when PEDOT:PSS samples are dried on a permanent
magnet, for example, we confirm that the coil-to-rod transition is
not a thermal effect. The magnetophoretic behavior of CPs remains
largely overlooked and underexplored; however, several connections
between prior efforts and our preliminary measurements are made. The
helicity of PEDOT:PSS is associated with the broadly negative CD and
paramagnetic response that we measure,37−39 which depends on and
is controlled by processing techniques. The connection to and relation
between these properties and low-level magnetophoresis deserve further
study.

The PEDOT aggregation induced via magnetophoresis appears
distinctly
different from the morphological changes that are induced via chemical
additives. Those chemically induced changes in PEDOT:PSS, which have
led to improvements in the thermoelectric response comparable to what
we measure, have been successfully correlated with Raman scattering
and GIWAXS data. However, Raman scattering measurements pumped at
532 nm currently do not discern distinct chemical changes, and GIWAXS
does not indicate new crystal structures that are not previously present
in the control samples. Because TOF-SIMS data show that the alignment
of PEDOT-rich domains are dramatic with magnetically treated samples,
we infer that the effect of the magnetic field is to rearrange and
separate PEDOT and PSS phases in randomly dispersed aggregations at
the nanoscale.

In conclusion, low-level magnetophoresis is demonstrated
as a viable
bottom-up approach to assemble PEDOT:PSS thin films. Overall, a fourfold
increase in the thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient and doubled measurements
of the electrical conductivity is achieved. It appears from the TOF-SIMS
images that the PEDOT phase may separate more distinctly from the
PSS phase when the CP settles in the presence of the applied magnetic
field. We furthermore attribute coil-to-rod alignment and aggregation
into channels because of the CP paramagnetic centers. The alignment
and aggregation of PEDOT into channels result in an anisotropic enhancement
of the electrical conductivity. The conductivity increases in the
direction of the applied magnetic field. Because the Raman and GIWAXS
measurements do not identify the presence of new spatial or spectral
features, we expect that the effect of the applied magnetic field
is to rearrange intermolecular bonds that are already present in a
manner that improves charge transport. The transport appears to be
nonlinear and influenced by the magnetophoretic alignment because
AFM measurements indicate that the current depends on the direction
of the electrical bias. We speculate that higher magnetic fields will
lead to deeper morphological changes that others have observed.17 The enhancement of electrical transport properties
in the direction of the previously applied fields points to magnetic-field-induced
alignment, phase separation, and aggregation within PEDOT:PSS, which
are strongest at the thin-film surface.

Experimental Section
Fabrication
of Thin Films
The aqueous dispersion of
PEDOT:PSS (Sigma-Aldrich electronic grade in water, 0.5% PEDOT, 0.8%
PSS wt) is placed in a glass vial, sealed with a parafilm, and sonicated
for 10 min. Plastic substrates (Pella 2225, 22 × 22 × 0.18
mm, polyvinyl chloride) are rinsed with deionized water, blown dry
with nitrogen, and plasma-cleaned in a vacuum chamber (Harrick PDC-326)
for 5 min. The substrate is placed in the center of a Helmholtz coil
with field lines oriented perpendicular or parallel (Figure 1) to the substrate and a strength
of 10 or 20 mT. A glass volumetric pipette is used to deposit 400
μL of PEDOT:PSS on the center of the substrate. Because of resistive
heating of the Helmholtz coil, the air temperature 1–2 mm above
the sample surface is approximately 25–27 °C (time-averaged),
measured with two thermocouples (Omega HH309a Datalogger Thermometer).
Control samples are produced at ambient air conditions with heated
Peltier tiles to provide equivalent conditions of 25–27 °C
1–2 mm above the sample surface (Figure 1). All samples are thermally annealed at
50 °C for 1 h in an oven to remove residual water (Hotpack Vacuum
Oven).

TOF-SIMS Measurement
3D chemical distribution maps
of PEDOT:PSS films are obtained by TOF-SIMS imaging (nanoTOF II, Physical
Electronics). The MW of PEDOT is estimated to be 41 g/mol. The primary
analysis ion is 20 kV Ga+, and the depth profile sputtering
gun is a giant cluster ion beam (Ar+ 2500, 20 kV). During
SIMS measurement, the surface charge is neutralized with low-energy
electron gun and gas gun (Ar+). The analysis area is 300
× 300 μm2, and the sputtering area is 500 ×
500 μm2 to ensure that the analyzed area is uniformly
sputtered. The measuring pressure is under ultrahigh vacuum (∼10–6 Pa). The thickness of the film is measured by a stylus
profiler (Bruker Dektak-XT) to be 4 μm, and the sputter rate
is back-calculated with the thickness. The ITO coating is grounded
to the metal sample holder with silver paste.

Electrical Conductivity
and Seebeck Coefficient Measurement
The electrical sheet
resistance R of the PEDOT:PSS
films is determined using gold point probes as electrodes and a Keithley
2611A Sourcemeter. The electrical conductivity (σ) is given  where the sample has
a resistance R, thickness t, length L, and width W.20 The
average t of the samples is determined from cross-sectional
views under SEM to be 200 ± 5 μm. The Seebeck coefficient
(S) of the PEDOT:PSS film is obtained from the slope
of the graph of ΔV as a function of ΔT  

The temperature
difference ΔT is produced across the sample
by two Peltier modules and
measured by two thermocouples (Omega HH309a Datalogger Thermometer).
The induced voltage difference ΔV is measured
by two probes of a fixed distance (Keithley 2182A Nanovoltmeter).

EPR Measurement
The samples are cut in small rectangular
pieces (∼100 × 30 mm2) and packed in 4 mm quartz
tubes to perform EPR measurements. Spectra are measured at room temperature
with a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer operating at X-band frequency (9.74
GHz), modulation frequency of 100 MHz with an amplitude of 3 G, 81.92
ms conversion time, and 20.48 ms time constant. The background effect
of the glass substrate has been removed in the given spectra. The
modulated and phase-sensitive-detected output signal is the first
derivative of the absorption spectrum. Spin concentrations are therefore
computed as the double integral of the output signal.

CD Measurement
CD measurements of the PEDOT:PSS films
are performed with white light from a Newport xenon solar simulator.
The circularly polarized light is generated with an achromatic linear
polarizer and a broadband quarter-wave plate (λ/60 retardance
accuracy) that is connected to a Thorlabs motorized rotation stage
(PRM1Z8). The samples are also connected to a motorized rotation stage
to control the motion within 10–3 degrees. The transmitted
light is captured via a CCD, fiber-coupled spectrometer (Filmetrics
F20-UV).

Raman Spectra Measurement
A Renishaw InVia micro-Raman
system is used to measure the Raman spectra of the PEDOT samples.
The laser excitation is at 532 nm, and the laser is linearly polarized.
The focused laser spot size is 1 μm in diameter after a 50×
objective and has a laser intensity less than 8000 W/cm2 in order to avoid sample damage. Raman spectra are centered at 1300
cm–1 and are measured with 1 s integration time,
averaging every minute.

Samples are placed perpendicular to
the laser pump and angled 45° with respect to the input laser.
Samples are tested with different orientations with respect to the
laser pump polarization. Substrate-parallel samples are rotated so
that the laser polarization is characterized both parallel and perpendicular
to the direction of the applied magnetic field used to cast samples.

GIWAXS Measurement
GIWAXS experiments are performed
at the complex material scattering (11-BM) beamline at the National
Synchrotron Light Source II. An X-ray energy of 13.5 keV (X-ray wavelength
0.9184 Å) is selected using a multilayer monochromator; a beam
size of 200 μm (horizontal) by 50 μm (vertical) is obtained
using a two-slit system. Two-dimensional X-ray scattering data are
collected on a fiber-coupled CCD area detector positioned 230 mm downstream
of the sample. Conversion of data into reciprocal space is accomplished
by measuring a silver behenate powder as a calibration standard. In
the presented data, the qz direction is defined to be the film normal direction, whereas qx is the orthogonal direction
within the film plane. Data presented here are collected at an incidence
angle of 0.2°, which is above the critical angle of the PEDOT:PSS
materials and thus probes the entire thickness of the polymer films.

AFM Measurement
Surface topography and conductivity
(current) maps of the PEDOT:PSS films are measured using AFM (Multimode
8, Bruker) in the conductive (C-AFM) mode. In brief, a conductive
AFM probe (SCM-PTSI, Bruker) is scanning and in contact with the sample
surface at a constant force, whereas a constant voltage bias is applied
to the sample. The height and current signals are recorded by the
conductive probe simultaneously. The local I–V curves are measured with the same conductive AFM probe
under the same constant-force contact at single individual positions
on aggregations and uniform flat surface.
