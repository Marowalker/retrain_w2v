Hydride transfer reactions are very important chemical reactions
in organic chemistry. It has been a chemist’s dream to predict
the rate constants of hydride transfer reactions by only using the
physical parameters of the reactants. To realize this dream, we have
developed a kinetic equation (Zhu equation) in our previous papers
to predict the activation free energies of various chemical reactions
using the activation free energies of the corresponding self-exchange
reactions and the related bond dissociation energies or redox potentials
of the reactants. Because the activation free energy of the hydride
self-exchange reaction is difficult to measure using the experimental
method, in this study, the activation free energies of 159 hydride
self-exchange reactions in acetonitrile at 298 K were systematically
computed using an accurately benchmarked density functional theory
method with a precision of 1.1 kcal mol–1. The results
show that the range of the activation free energies of the 159 hydride
self-exchange reactions is from 16.1 to 46.6 kcal mol–1. The activation free energies of 25 122 hydride transfer
reactions in acetonitrile at 298 K can be estimated using the activation
free energies of the 159 hydride self-exchange reactions and the corresponding
heterolytic bond dissociation free energies of the reactants. The
effects of the heteroatom, substituent, and aromaticity on the activation
free energies of hydride self-exchange reactions were examined. The
results show that heteroatoms, substituents at the reaction center,
and the aromaticity of reactants, all have remarkable effects on the
activation free energy of hydride self-exchange reactions. All kinetic
information provided in this work on the hydride self-exchange reactions
in acetonitrile at 298 K should be very useful in chemical labs and
chemical industry.

1 Introduction
Hydride transfer reactions (eq 1) are very important organic chemical reactions and
have been widely used for the mutual conversion between organic unsaturated
and saturated compounds1−3 as well as the preparation and conversion of hydrogen
gas as green energy.4−8 It is well-known that if a hydride transfer reaction can be used,
there are two most fundamental scientific problems that need to be
solved first: one is the thermodynamic problem, that is, how much
is the thermodynamic driving force of the hydride transfer reaction,
ΔGo(XH/Y+)? The other
is the kinetic problem, that is, how much is the activation free energy
of the hydride transfer reaction, ΔG⧧(XH/Y+)? As to the thermodynamic problem of hydride transfer
reactions, as long as the molar free energy change of the hydride
donor (XH) to release hydride anions, ΔGo(XH), and the molar free energy change of the
hydride acceptor (Y+) to accept
hydride anions, ΔGo(Y+), are available, the thermodynamic driving force of the hydride
transfer reaction, ΔGo(XH/Y+), can be obtained by using eq 2. Because the ΔGo(XH) values of many important organic hydride donors9−13 and the ΔGo(Y+) values
of many important organic hydride acceptors, such as olefins,14,15 imines,16 and carbonyl17 compounds have been determined in acetonitrile at room
temperature in our lab, the thermodynamic problems of many important
organic hydride transfer reactions, in fact, have been well-solved
in our previous work. However, unlike the thermodynamic driving force
of hydride transfer reactions, ΔGo(XH/Y+), the activation free energy of hydride transfer
reactions, ΔG⧧(XH/Y+), cannot be predicted using the related physical parameters of reactants
up to now. The main reason is that the factors affecting the kinetics
of reactions are much more complicated and diversified than those
affecting the thermodynamics of reactions. In fact, it has been a
chemist’s dream to predict the activation free energy of hydride
transfer reactions only by using the physical parameters of reactants.

In our previous work,18 we reported
a new kinetic equation (eq 3 and named as Zhu equation) to quantitatively estimate the
activation free energy of various chemical reactions using the activation
free energies of the corresponding self-exchange reactions and the
related bond dissociation energies or redox potentials of the reactants.
The validity of the Zhu equation has been verified by predicting the
kinetic isotope effect values of 4556 hydride transfer reactions18 and the activation free energies of 5886 hydrogen
atom transfer reactions19 in acetonitrile
at 298 K.

For hydride transfer reactions, in eq 3, ΔG⧧(XH/Y+) and ΔGo(XH/Y+) are the activation free energy and thermodynamic driving force
of the hydride transfer reactions, respectively. ΔG⧧(XH/X+) and ΔG⧧(YH/Y+) are the activation free energies
of the corresponding hydride self-exchange reactions for reactant XH and reactant Y+, respectively.
Because the thermodynamic driving forces of many hydride transfer
reactions, ΔGo(XH/Y+),
have been measured in our lab, evidently, as long as the activation
free energy of the corresponding hydride self-exchange reactions is
available, the activation free energies of the hydride transfer reactions
can be obtained by using eq 3. Because the activation free energy value of hydride self-exchange
reactions, ΔG⧧(XH/X+), like the molar free energy change of the hydride donor (XH) to release hydride anions, ΔGo(XH), is also the characteristic parameter of the hydride
donor (XH) or the hydride acceptor (X+), it is clear that as long as the ΔG⧧(XH/X+) values of the reactants
(XH and X+) are
available, the chemist’s dream that the activation free energy
of hydride transfer reactions can be predicted only by using the characteristic
physical parameters of the reactants can be realized. However, since
the activation free energy values of hydride self-exchange reactions
in solution have so far been scarce,20 there
is an urgent need in chemical labs and chemical industries to determine
these values in the same solvent and at the same temperature. 1   2  

Zhu equation 3  

It is well-known that for electron-,21−24 proton-,25−28 and hydrogen atom-29−31 self-exchange reactions, the activation free energy values can be
directly measured using dynamic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
or dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques because the
rates of these self-exchange reactions are generally fast enough to
meet the requirements of dynamic EPR or dynamic NMR techniques. However,
for hydride self-exchange reactions, the reaction rates are generally
too slow to be measured using dynamic NMR techniques (requiring k2 to be within 102–106 M–1 s–1).20 To the best of our knowledge, except some indirect
experimental methods,20 no direct experimental
methods were reported in the literature to accurately determine the
activation free energy of hydride self-exchange reactions in solution.

Owing to the development of density functional theory (DFT) in
recent years and the large enhancement of computational capability,
the activation free energies of many organic reactions in solution
can be computed by employing suitable density functionals, which means
that the activation free energy values of hydride self-exchange reactions
in solution could also be obtained by the DFT method. In this work,
we try to use a suitable DFT method to estimate the activation free
energies of hydride self-exchange reactions in acetonitrile at room
temperature. Because dihydropyridine, dihydroquinoline, dihydroarcridine,
and dihydroimidazole as well as their various derivatives are all
well-known good hydride donors and many of them have been extensively
applied as efficient reducing agents in reductions of various organic
unsaturated compounds,32−35 159 hydride self-exchange reactions involving dihydropyridine, dihydroquinoline,
dihydroarcridine, and dihydroimidazole as well as their various derivatives
and analogues as hydride donors are examined in this work. The parent
structures and marks of the 159 hydride donors are shown in Scheme 1.

2 Results
Because it is the first time to systematically compute the activation
free energies of various hydride self-exchange reactions in acetonitrile
at room temperature by using the DFT method, it is necessary to examine
the reliability of the computational method by comparing the computational
results with the corresponding experimental results. In this work,
six hydride cross-transfer reactions (eqs 4–9) were selected
because they are all well-known hydride transfer reactions, and the
activation free energies values in acetonitrile at 298 K can be directly
measured using the conventional experimental methods18,20,36 (see Table 1). 4   5   6   7   8   9

b Computational activation free energies
by using different methods to compute the gas-phase electronic energy
(method 1: M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP; method 2: M06-2X-D3/def2-QZVP; method
3: M06-2X-D3/MG3S; method 4: M06-2X/def2-TZVPP; method 5: B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPP;
and method 6: BMK-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPP).

c MAD, mean absolute deviation; RMSD,
root-mean-square deviation.

Because optimization by using M06-2X/6-31+G** can give reliable
geometries for organic compounds37 and
also it has been proved that the solvation energy computation protocol
M05-2X/6-31G*/SMD can achieve the smallest error for general computation,38 we only need to evaluate the reliability of
different methods to compute the gas-phase electronic energy for the
six hydride cross-transfer reactions (eqs 4–9). Three different
density functionals (M06-2X, B3LYP, and BMK) were compared in the
evaluation with or without Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction
in combination with the def2-TZVPP basis set, and the optimal density
functional was further evaluated in combination with MG3S and def2-QZVP
to test the basis set effect on computational performance. The detailed
results of different methods are listed in Table 1 (and Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

Without D3 correction, the performances of B3LYP and BMK in combination
with def2-TZVPP were extremely poor with the MAD value up to 16.3
and 10.3 kcal mol–1 (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), whereas the MAD of B3LYP-D3(BJ)
and BMK-D3(BJ) were 2.6 and 6.1 kcal mol–1 respectively.
M06-2X gave a comforting result (MAD 2.3 kcal mol–1) because of its parameterization against barrier heights and noncovalent
interactions, but the deviation exceeds 2 kcal mol–1 in four reactions. After D3 correction, M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP reduced
the MAD to 1.1 kcal mol–1, and its estimation error
exceeded 2.0 kcal mol–1 in one reaction, indicating
the importance of including dispersion description in these reactions
with rings. As for the basis set, in combination with the optimal
M06-2X-D3 density functional, Ahlrichs basis set (def2-TZVPP) outperformed
the Pople type basis set (MG3S) a little, and there is no improvement
from def2-TZVPP to def2-QZVP in these reactions. Therefore, the method
of M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP was chosen in this work to compute the gas-phase
electronic energies for the 159 hydride self-exchange reactions (XH/X+). We chose the
same method as the optimal method for the computation of reaction
Gibbs free energy change. To be concise, the assessment of different
computational methods on the computation of reaction Gibbs free energy
change are provided in the Supporting Information (Table S2). The final computed activation energies of the 159 hydride
self-exchange reactions in acetonitrile at 298 K are listed in Table 2. To examine the contributions
of activation enthalpy and activation entropy to the activation free
energy and the effect of the heterolytic bond dissociation free energy
of the hydride donors on the activation free energy, activation enthalpies
and activation entropies of the 159 hydride self-exchange reactions
as well as the heterolytic bond dissociation free energy of 159 hydride
donors (XH) in acetonitrile at 298 K were also computed
and are provided in Table 2.

3 Scale of ΔG⧧(XH/X+)
From Table 2, it
is clear that although the thermodynamic driving forces of the 159
hydride self-exchange reactions in acetonitrile at 298 K, ΔGo(XH/X+), are all equal to zero,
the activation free energy values of the 159 hydride self-exchange
reactions in acetonitrile at 298 K, ΔG⧧(XH/X+), are all quite different and range
from 16.1 kcal mol–1 for 41H/41+ to 46.6 kcal mol–1 for 36H(tBu)/36+(tBu). Such a large range
of ΔG⧧(XH/X+)
not only indicates the mistake of linear free energy relationship
between ΔG⧧ and ΔGo for various chemical reactions but also shows
that the activation free energy of hydride self-exchange reactions
is strongly dependent on the structure and composition of the reactants.
To elucidate the main factors in structure and composition of the
reactants that affect ΔG⧧(XH/X+), a plot of ΔG⧧(XH/X+) values with 53 typical hydride donors (XH) are
presented in Figure 1. From Figure 1, it
is clear that the magnitude of ΔG⧧(XH/X+) depends not only on the structure but also on
the composition of reactants, and no main structural factors can be
easily found, which means that the factors affecting ΔG⧧(XH/X+) are quite complex.
There is no doubt that the intrinsic logic relations between ΔG⧧(XH/X+) and the structure
and composition of the reactants (XH and X+) should be
one of the most important issues in physical chemistry for further
investigations. However, several main factors that affect ΔG⧧(XH/X+) for some special
reactants can still be examined here.

4 Main Factors Affecting ΔG⧧(XH/X+)
4.1 Heteroatom Effect on the Activation Free Energy
It is well-known that if heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen,
sulfur, and so forth, are used to replace the carbon atom in a chemical
compound, the heteroatom can not only change the physical property
of the compound but also change the chemical property of the compound,
which means that the heteroatom in the reactants should have great
influence on the activation free energy of the hydride self-exchange
reactions. From Table 2, it is clear that when the carbon atom at the para position to the
reaction center of the reactant (9H) is replaced by nitrogen
(1H), oxygen (5H), and sulfur (7H), the activation free energy values of the corresponding hydride
self-exchange reactions (9H/9+, 1H/1+, 5H/5+,
and 7H/7+) are altered,
as shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2a,
it is clear that the heteroatoms, especially the nitrogen atom (1H) and the oxygen atom (5H), can significantly
increase the activation free energy of the corresponding hydride self-exchange
reactions, and the increase order is that N atom (24.2 kcal mol–1 for 1H/1+) > O atom (21.8 kcal mol–1 for 5H/5+) > S atom (19.5 kcal mol–1 for 7H/7+) ≥ C atom (19.5 kcal mol–1 for 9H/9+). In the same way,
if the carbon atom at the ortho position of the reactant (15H) is replaced by nitrogen (12H), oxygen (13H), and sulfur (14H), it is found that the heteroatoms
at the ortho position to the reaction center can also significantly
increase the activation free energy of the hydride self-reactions,
and the increase order is N (25.0 kcal mol–1 for 12H/12+) > O (24.2 kcal
mol–1 for 13H/13+) > S (23.1 kcal mol–1 for 14H/14+) > C (18.1 kcal
mol–1 for 15H/15+) [Figure 2b]. Because the activation free energy changes of 14H/14+ (5.0 kcal mol–1), 13H/13+ (6.1
kcal mol–1), and 12H/12+ (6.9 kcal mol–1) from
that of 15H/15+ are
all larger than the corresponding activation free energy changes of 7H/7+ (0.01 kcal mol–1), 5H/5+ (2.3 kcal mol–1), and 1H/1+ (4.7 kcal mol–1) from that of 9H/9+, respectively, it is clear that the effect of heteroatoms at the
2-position on the activation free energy is much larger than that
of the heteroatoms at the 4-position. The main reason is that the
position of the heteroatom at the 2-position is closer to the reaction
center of the reactant than that of the heteroatom at the 4-position.

Figure 2 Heteroatom effect on the activation parameters of 1,4-dihydrobenzene
and 1,2-dihydro-isomer (energy unit: kcal mol–1).

If the activation enthalpy and activation entropy for the hydride
self-exchange reactions with 1,4-dihydro-compounds as hydride donors
(9H/9+, 7H/7+, 5H/5+, and 1H/1+) as well as 1,2-dihydro-isomers as hydride donors
(15H/15+, 14H/14+, 13H/13+, and 12H/12+) are examined together, it is
found that for the hydride self-exchange reactions with 1,4-dihydro-compounds
as reactants, the activation entropies have no significant change,
but the activation enthalpies have a significant change: 12.9 kcal
mol–1 for 1H/1+, 10.4 kcal mol–1 for 5H/5+, 7.9 kcal mol–1 for 7H/7+, and
7.7 kcal mol–1 for 9H/9+, which indicates that the effect of the
heteroatoms at the 4-position on the activation free energy is mainly
due to the activation enthalpy change. Little or no effect of the
heteroatom at the 4-position on the activation entropy is found; the
main reason could be that the position of the heteroatom at the 4-position
in the molecule is further from the reaction center in the reactants
than that at the 2-position.

Because the activation entropy change of reactions mainly depends
on the conformation change of the reactant system from the initial
state to the transition state (TS) and the activation enthalpy of
reactions mainly depends on the bond energy change of the reactant
system from the initial state to the TS, it is conceived that for
the 1,4-dihydro-compounds as hydride donors, the conformation change
of the reactant system from the initial state to the TS should be
similar for each other, but for the 1,2-dihydro-isomer as hydride
donors, the conformation change of the reactant system from the initial
state to the TS could be a little different from each other.

In addition, from Figure 2, it is interesting to find that ΔGo(XH) values of the hydride donors decrease in the following
order: 9H (90.5 kcal mol–1) > 5H (76.5 kcal mol–1) > 7H (75.9
kcal mol–1) > 1H (52.5 kcal mol–1) for the 1,4-dihydro hydride donors and 15H (89.6 kcal mol–1) > 14H (77.2 kcal
mol–1) > 13H (74.4 kcal mol–1) > 12H (49.0 kcal mol–1) for the
1,2-dihydro hydride donors, but the corresponding activation free
energy changes decrease in the opposite direction. The smaller the
heterolytic bond dissociation free energy of the reactants, the greater
the activation energy of the corresponding hydride self-exchange reactions;
what is the reason for this anomaly?

In our previous paper,19 we reported
a new version of Zhu equation (eq 10) from eq 3, the purpose of which is to realize chemists’ dream that
the activation free energy of a chemical reaction can be directly
estimated only using the corresponding characteristic physical parameter
of the reactants. In eq 10, ΔG⧧o(XH) and ΔG⧧o(X+) are called the thermo-kinetic
parameters of reactants XH and X+, respectively, because
both the physical parameters are made of the thermodynamic parameter
of the reactants, ΔGo(XH), and the
kinetic parameter of the reactants, ΔG⧧(XH/X+), (see eqs 11 and 12, respectively).
The physical meanings of ΔG⧧o(XH) and ΔG⧧o(X+) are shown in Scheme 2 and Figure 3. Because
ΔG⧧o(XH) is the free energy
absorbed by XH from the initial state of the reaction to the TS of
the reaction and ΔG⧧o(X+) is the free energy released by X+ from the initial
state of the reaction to the TS of the reaction, obviously, ΔG⧧o(XH) is the real resistance of the
reaction, and ΔG⧧o(X+) is the real power of the reaction. Because the magnitudes
of ΔG⧧o(XH) and ΔG⧧o(X+) not only depend on
the heterolytic bond dissociation free energy of the reactants, ΔGo(XH), but also depend on the activation free
energy of the hydride self-exchange reaction, ΔG⧧(XH/X+), we should not be amazed at
the anomaly that the greater the heterolytic bond dissociation free
energy of the reactant, the smaller the activation free energy of
the hydride self-exchange reaction. To elucidate the reason for the
anomaly, the thermo-kinetic parameters of 159 XH to release the hydride
ion and the thermo-kinetic parameters of 159 X+ to capture
the hydride ion in acetonitrile at 298 K were calculated according
to eqs 11 and 12, respectively, and the results are listed in Table 3. 10

X+ and XH, described by two reverse Morse-type free energy
curves: the left one (red) refers to the chemical process of XH to
release the hydride ion; the right one (black) refers to the chemical
process of X+ to capture the hydride ion; the intersecting
point refers to the TS.

Definition 11   12  

From Table 3, we
can find that the thermo-kinetic parameters of XH in
acetonitrile at 298 K are 55.0, 47.7, 49.2, and 38.4 kcal mol–1 for 9H, 7H, 5H, and 1H, respectively; and the thermo-kinetic parameters
of X+ in acetonitrile at 298
K are −35.5, −28.2, −27.4, and −14.1 kcal
mol–1 for 9+, 7+, 5+, and 1+, respectively.
Although the thermo-kinetic parameters of 9H, 5H, 7H, and 1H decrease successively as the
ΔGo(XH) values of 9H (90.5 kcal mol–1), 5H (76.5 kcal
mol–1), 7H (75.9 kcal mol–1), and 1H (52.5 kcal mol–1) decrease,
the thermo-kinetic parameters of 9+, 7+, 5+, and 1+ increase successively as ΔGo(XH)
decreases, and the values of the latter ones increase relative to
that of 9+ (7.3 kcal mol–1 for 7+, 8.1
kcal mol–1 for 5+, and 21.4 kcal mol–1 for 1+, respectively) are all larger than the values
of the corresponding former ones that decrease relative to that of 9H (−7.3 kcal mol–1 for 7H, −5.8 kcal mol–1 for 5H, and
−16.6 kcal mol–1 for 1H, respectively).
It is this reason that leads to the anomaly that the greater the heterolytic
bond dissociation free energy of reactants, the smaller the activation
free energy of the hydride self-exchange reactions.

4.2 Substituent Effect on the Activation Free
Energy
It is well-known that the substituent effect is the
thermodynamic and/or kinetic parameter change of a reaction when one
atom or atom group in the reactants is substituted by another atom
or atom group. For a bimolecular reaction, when one reactant is modified
by a substituent, the substituent effect (electronic effect and steric
effect) on the reaction rate can be used to rationalize the reaction
mechanism. However, for a hydride self-exchange reaction, as both
the reactants carry the same substituent, the substituent effect on
the reaction rate could become more complex. To elucidate the effect
of the substituent nature, position, and size on the rate of hydride
self-exchange reactions, the activation free energies of hydride self-exchange
reactions, with 2H(Me), 3H(Me), 1H(H), 1H(Me), and 4H(Me) as hydride donors
[Figure 4a], and the
activation free energies of hydride self-exchange reactions, with 2H(CN), 3H(CN), 1H(H), 1H(CN), and 4H(CN) as hydride donors [Figure 4b], as well as the activation free energies
of hydride self-exchange reactions with 1H(H), 4H(Me), and 4H(tBu) as hydride
donors [Figure 4c]
are compared together.

Figure 4 Effects of nature, position, and size of the substituent groups
on the activation free energy (energy unit: kcal mol–1).

From Figure 4a,
it is clear that the effects of the substituent at 1-, 2-, and 3-positions
are all quite small, but the effect of the substituent at the 4-position
is prominent; the reason is that the substituent at the 4-position
is closest to the reaction center. However, when the activation enthalpy
and activation entropy of the hydride self-exchange reactions for
the 4-substituted reactants are compared, an unexpected finding is
that the main change is enthalpy rather than entropy.

When Figure 4a and 4b are compared, it is found that although CN is
a strong electron-withdrawing group, its effect does not make the
hydride self-exchange reaction much slower. The reason is that although
CN reduces the hydride-donating ability of the hydride donor, at the
same time, CN can also enhance the hydride-accepting ability of the
hydride acceptor. The cancelation leads to the fact that the electronic
effects of the substituent is not a major factor to affect hydride
self-exchange reactions (eq 13).

From Figure 4c,
it is clear that when the hydrogen atom at the 4-position in 1,4-dihydropyridine
is replaced by different bulky substituents (Me and tBu), the activation free energy increases significantly as the size
of the substituent increases. If the activation enthalpy change and
the activation entropy change are compared, it is surprising to find
that the main cause of the bulky effect of the substituent is the
activation enthalpy change rather than the activation entropy change. 13  

4.3 Aromatization Effect of the Reactant on the
Activation Free Energy
From the structure of the hydride
donors examined in this work (Scheme 1), it is clear that the 159 organic compounds are mostly
heterocyclic compounds. Because the aromaticity of the heterocyclic
compounds is an important component of the thermodynamic driving force
for the heterocyclic compounds to release hydride ions, obviously,
the aromatization of heterocyclic compounds should be an important
factor to affect the activation free energy values of the corresponding
hydride self-exchange reactions. To elucidate the dependence of the
activation free energy of hydride self-exchange reactions on the aromatization
of heterocyclic compounds, some related physical parameters of 1H, 16H, and 35H for their corresponding
hydride self-exchange reactions are compared together in Figure 5. From Figure 5, it is interesting to find
that the greater the aromaticity of the hydride acceptor, the smaller
the activation free energy of the corresponding hydride self-exchange
reaction.

Figure 5 Aromatization effect of the reactants on the hydride self-exchange
reaction activation free energy.

5 Application of ΔG⧧(XH/X+)
5.1 Prediction of the Activation Free Energy of
Various Hydride Transfer Reactions
Because the thermokinetic
parameters of the 159 hydride donors [ΔG⧧o(XH)] and 159 hydride acceptors [ΔG⧧o(X+)] in acetonitrile at 298 K can
be obtained from the activation free energy of the corresponding 159
hydride self-exchange reactions and the molar free energy change of
the 159 hydride donors to release hydride ions in acetonitrile at
298 K (Table 3), the
activation free energy values of 25 122 (A1592 = 25 122) hydride transfer reactions
in acetonitrile at 298 K can be estimated from these thermo-kinetic
parameters of hydride donors (XH) and acceptors (X+), according
to the new version of Zhu equation (eq 10). Because of the limitation of the paper space, the
detailed results of the 25 122 activation free energy values
are not provided in this paper. However, to verify the 25 122
predictions, the activation free energies of 41 representative cross-reactions
among them were examined by DFT computation, and the results are provided
in Table 4. As we can
see, the activation free energies derived from Zhu equation (eq 10) are all quite close
to those directly computed by the benchmarked DFT method.

Because compounds XH or corresponding compounds X+ in Scheme 1 can all be extensively
used as hydride donors or acceptors, it is clear that the activation
free energy values of the 25 122 hydride transfer reactions
in acetonitrile at 298 K should be very useful in chemical labs and
in chemical industry.

5.2 Quest for the Oxidation–Reduction Center
Structure of Nicotinamide Coenzyme
It is well-known that
nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide coenzyme (NADH and NAD+) plays a vital role in bioreductions in living bodies by cycle transfer
of an apparent hydride ion (eq 14). In the past decade, studies on the oxidation–reduction
center structure of NADH have been an interesting issue. In the early
days, the oxidation–reduction center structure of NADH was
generally believed to be 1,2-dihydropyridine.40,41 Until the late 1950s, the center structure of NADH was unambiguously
identified to be 1,4-dihydropyridine rather than 1,2-dihydropyridine.41,42 This naturally introduces an interesting question: why NADH coenzyme
chooses 1,4-dihydropyridine rather than the corresponding 1,2-dihydroisomer
as its redox active center structure in the hydride transfer cycle?
The reason is obviously related to the thermodynamic and kinetic difference
between 1,4-dihydropyridine and 1,2-dihydropyridine in their hydride
transfer cycles. To elucidate this question, in this work, we used
1,4-dihydropyridine (1H) and 1,2-dihydropyridine (12H) as the models of NADH and its 1,2-dihydroisomer and chose 80+ as the hydride acceptor for 1H and 12H. At the same time, we chose 2H(NH2) as the hydride
donor for the regeneration of 1H and 12H from 1+ and 12+, respectively. The two hydride transfer
cycles for 1H and 12H are constructed in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Hydride Transfer Cycles between 1,4-Dihydropyridine and Its 1,2-Dihydroisomer
(Energy Unit: kcal mol–1)
From Scheme 3, it
is clear that during the hydride transfer from 1H or 12H to 80+, the activation
free energy of the hydride transfers from 1H to 80+ (15.5 kcal mol–1) is greater than that of the hydride transfer from 12H to 80+ (14.1 kcal mol–1), which means that the hydride transfer from 1H to 80+ is more unfavorable than that
from 12H to 80+.
But during the regeneration of 1H or 12H by hydride transfer from 2H(NH2) to pyridinium salt, the activation free energy of
the hydride attacking the 4-position on the pyridinium ring is smaller
than that of the hydride attacking the 2-position on the pyridinium
ring by 2.1 kcal mol–1, which indicates that the
pyridinium cation formed from 1,2-dihydropyridines cannot return to
the original reduced form, 1,2-dihydropyridine, by hydride transfer
cycle, that is, 1,2-dihydropyridines cannot regenerate from the corresponding
cation by the hydride transfer cycle. Obviously, the much more negative
thermo-kinetic parameter value of 1+ to yield 1H (−14.1 kcal mol–1) than that of 12+ to yield 12H (−12.0 kcal mol–1) should be
a key reason that makes NADH coenzyme choose 1,4-dihydropyridine rather
than 1,2-dihydropyridine as its redox active center structure in vivo. 14  

6 Conclusions
In this work, the activation free energies, activation enthalpies,
and activation entropies of 159 hydride self-exchange reactions as
well as the heterolytic bond dissociation free energies of the corresponding
159 hydride donors in acetonitrile at 298 K were systematically computed
by the DFT method: M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP//M06-2X-D3/6-31+G**/SMD with
solvation energy computed at M05-2X/6-31G*/SMD level of theory. After
analysis of the activation free energies scale of the 159 hydride
self-exchange reactions in acetonitrile at 298 K and examination of
the effects of the heteroatom, substituent, and aromatic property
of reactants on the activation free energies of the hydride self-exchange
reactions, the following conclusions can be made: (i) The activation
free energy values of the 159 hydride self-exchange reactions range
from 16.1 to 46.6 kcal mol–1, which strongly indicates
the incorrectness of the linear free energy relationship between the
activation free energies (ΔG⧧) and the corresponding thermodynamic driving forces of reactions
(ΔGo) for chemical reactions. (ii)
For the 159 hydride self-exchange reactions, the activation free energy
differences among them are mainly due to the differences in the activation
enthalpies. (iii) Heteroatoms (N, O, and S) in the reactants can effectively
change the activation free energies of hydride self-exchange reactions.
In general, the order of decrease of the activation energy as heteroatoms
change is N > O > S > C. (iv) The effects of substituents on the activation
free energies of hydride self-exchange reactions are generally quite
small (smaller than 1 kcal mol–1), except the substituent
at the position of the reaction center where both electron-withdrawing
and electron-donating substituents significantly increase the activation
free energies of hydride self-exchange reactions. The steric substituent
at the reaction center can also effectively increase the activation
free energies of hydride self-exchange reactions. In general, the
larger the substituent size, the larger the activation free energy.
(v) The substituent effects on the activation enthalpy are much larger
than those on the activation entropy. (vi) The aromatization of reactants
also has an evident effect on the activation free energies of hydride
self-exchange reactions. In general, the larger the aromaticity change
from the hydride donor (XH) to the hydride acceptor (X+), the smaller the activation energy of the corresponding hydride
self-exchange reaction. It is evident that these important and hard-to-get
activation free energies of various hydride self-exchange reactions
in acetonitrile and the conclusions on the effects of heteroatom,
substituent, and aromatic property of reactants on the activation
free energies of the hydride self-exchange reactions could provide
very important clues to choose a suitable reducing agent from Scheme 1 and predict the
reaction rate of various hydride transfer reactions.

7 Computational Method
All structures were optimized by using M06-2X43-D344/6-31+G**45,46 in acetonitrile with the SMD solvation model38 accounting for solvent effects. Each optimized structure
was confirmed to be a real minimum for a reactant or a first order
saddle point with only one imaginary frequency corresponding to the
hydride transfer process for the TS by frequency analysis at the same
level of theory as optimization. Electronic energies were computed
in the gas phase at M06-2X/def2-TZVPP,47 M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVPP, M06-2X-D3/MG3S,48 M06-2X-D3/def2-QZVP,47 B3LYP49/def2-TZVPP, B3LYP-D3(BJ)50/def2-TZVPP, BMK51/def2-TZVPP,
and BMK-D3(BJ)50/def2-TZVPP levels. Solvation
energies were computed on the optimized structures in acetonitrile
at M05-2X52/6-31G* level with the SMD solvation
model. The thermal corrections to the Gibbs free energy were obtained
at 298.15 K with a vibrational frequency scale factor of 0.967,53 whereas entropic contributions to the free energy
were calculated using Truhlar’s quasi-harmonic correction54 by setting all vibrational frequencies less
than 100–100 cm–1 to reduce errors arising
from treating low frequency vibrations as harmonic oscillators. The
reference state for gas-phase computation is 1 atm, whereas for solution
phase, it is 1 M. The ultrafine integral grid was used throughout
the study. All computations were performed by using Gaussian 09 program
package.55

The activation free energy of a hydride self-exchange reaction,
ΔG⧧(XH/X+), is
defined as the Gibbs free energy difference between TS and isolated
reactants (XH and X+) by eq 15. The Gibbs
free energy of each species (XH, X+, and TS) in solution is calculated by eq 16, where Egas is the gas phase electronic energy, ΔGsol is the solvation energy, ΔGcorr is the thermal correction to Gibbs free
energy, and the last term 1.9 kcal mol–1 accounts
for the change of reference state from 1 atm to 1 M. 15   16  

The heterolytic bond dissociation free energy of hydride compound
(XH), ΔGo(XH), is defined in this
work as the molar Gibbs free energy change of XH releasing the hydride
ion (H–) in acetonitrile
at 298 K. The isodesmic reaction (eq 17) is constructed to compute ΔGo(XH) to avoid the inaccuracy in directly computing the
energy of a hydride ion in acetonitrile. A reliable experimental ΔGo(XH) value (76.2 kcal mol–1) of 10-methyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (AcrH2) in acetonitrile20 was used in the computation. ΔGo(XH) of XH in acetonitrile is computed by eq 18. 17   18
