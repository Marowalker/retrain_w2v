The
chemical and electronic structure of MoO3 thin films
is monitored by synchrotron-based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
while annealing from room temperature to 310 °C. Color-coded
2D intensity maps of the Mo 3d and O 1s and valence band maximum (VBM)
spectra show the evolution of the annealing-induced changes. Broadening
of the Mo 3d and O 1s spectra indicate the reduction of MoO3. At moderate temperatures (120–200 °C), we find spectral
evidence for the formation of Mo5+ and at higher temperatures
(>165 °C) also of Mo4+ states. These states can
be
related to the spectral intensity above the VBM attributed to O vacancy
induced gap states caused by partial filling of initially unoccupied
Mo 4d-derived states. A clear relation between annealing temperature
and the induced changes in the chemical and electronic structure suggests
this approach as a route for deliberate tuning of MoO3 thin-film
properties.

Introduction
It has been demonstrated
that molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is an excellent (inorganic)
hole transport material (HTM) in optoelectronic
devices, such as solar cells and/or organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs).1,2 Due to its large work function, MoO3 generally has a favorable energy level alignment with the
active materials and the anode in these devices.3−5 For example,
in organic solar cells (OSCs), after replacing the (organic) HTM PEDOT:PSS
with inorganic MoO3, mainly to improve long-term stability,
the efficiency remained unchanged or was even improved.6−8 However, for perovskite-based photovoltaic devices, it has been
suggested that the deep valence band of MoO3 blocks the
hole transport.9 One proposed solution
to overcome this problem is to create states within the band gap above
the valence band maximum (VBM), also called gap states.10 Gap states in MoO3 thin films can
be created through, for example, exposure to a reducing atmosphere,11 ion bombardment,12 thermal annealing,13,14 etc. The induced (defect) states
in the band gap are suggested to generate conduction paths, enhancing
hole extraction.10 For device optimization,
Vasilopoulou et al.15 studied the correlation
between the electronic structure and the composition of MoO3 films and reported the improvements of OSCs and OLEDs performance
upon creating oxygen vacancies or inserting hydrogen atoms into the
employed MoO3. A more favorable energy level alignment
was suggested as an explanation, reducing voltage loss and facilitating
barrier-free hole extraction. Sample annealing treatments are a common
way to introduce oxygen vacancies to tune the electronic structure
of metal oxides.16,17 With increasing annealing temperature,
defect states are proposed to form due to oxygen escaping from the
sample (surface); this process in principle allows deliberate modification
of the material’s electronic structure. Dasgupta et al.18 reported a MoO3 annealing temperature
of 250 °C in the N2 atmosphere to be ideal, resulting
in an improved charge transport yielding a 50% solar cell performance
enhancement. In contrast, Lee et al.19 demonstrated
that an annealing-induced reduction of MoO3 is detrimental:
They reported a reduced OSC efficiency independent of whether the
MoO3 was annealed in N2, mixed H2/N2 atmosphere, or ambient air at 200 or 400 °C,
compared to using as-prepared MoO3 films. It was suggested
that for the as-prepared MoO3, in this particular case,
the intrinsic oxygen vacancies and, thus, the already present gap
states provided sufficient hole transport, while annealing led to
further reduction and detrimental metallic behavior. Note that in
this case, the (surface) stoichiometry can be expected to significantly
deviate from the nominal [O]:[Mo] = 3:1 composition. These seemingly
inconsistent results might be attributed to the different initial
(i.e., as-prepared) states of the studied MoO3 materials
in terms of oxygen vacancy/gap state density.

In order to systematically
study the impact of annealing on the
[O]:[Mo] composition and the presence and density of gap states, we
have in situ monitored the changes in the chemical and electronic
structure of MoO3 thin films by hard X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (HAXPES) while annealing in vacuum. This will establish
a sound base for the deliberate tuning of the gap states density via
the [O]:[Mo] composition in molybdenum oxides.

Results and Discussion
The survey spectra of the as-prepared and annealed MoO3 films (i.e., before and after in situ annealing, respectively) are
shown in the Supporting Information (see Figure S1). All expected core level lines of Mo and O atoms are detected.
In addition, a small C 1s peak can be observed that might indicate
the presence of surface contaminants formed on the sample during sample
transport (in inert gas) and/or sample mounting (in ambient conditions).
Note that the incorporation of (some) carbon in the MoO3 material during PVD processing under high vacuum conditions can
also not be excluded. At first sight, the spectra are very similar
before and after annealing, for a more detailed discussion of the
annealing-induced changes, we will focus on the detail spectra in
the following.

In order to better follow the changes of the
Mo 3d and O 1s detail
spectra during in situ annealing, the individual spectra are summarized
as 2D maps in Figure 1a,b, respectively. The x axis shows the BE region
of the spectra; the color code indicates the spectral intensity (normalized
to the intensity in the BE range of 227.5–228.5 eV for Mo 3d
and 524–525 eV for O 1s to exclude intensity variations due
to fluctuating photon flux); and the y axis represents
the annealing temperature (and thus also annealing time). The 2D maps
(in particular of the Mo 3d line) clearly show a redistribution of
spectral intensity indicating annealing-induced changes of the MoO3 chemical structure. However, also distinct spectral changes
in the O 1s line (i.e., emergence of peak at BE ∼533.1 eV)
induced by the annealing treatment are observed. The top panels in Figure 1 show respective
(a) Mo 3d and (b) O 1s sum spectra derived by adding individual spectra
in the temperature ranges of 30–100 °C and 240–310
°C.

Figure 1 Evolution of the (a) Mo 3d and (b) O 1s spectra upon in situ annealing
in vacuum presented in 2D intensity maps, where the x axis represents the binding energy region of the spectra, the y axis shows the annealing temperature (and thus also annealing
time), and the color code indicates the normalized spectral intensity.
The upper panels show respective sum spectra recorded in the stated
temperature regime.

From RT to around 100
°C (i.e., the temperature range highlighted
by the blue box and represented by the blue spectrum in the top panel
of Figure 1a), little
or no change is detected in the Mo 3d 2D map. Increasing the annealing
temperature from 100 °C to around 240 °C, in contrast, causes
obvious changes of the Mo 3d spectra. The 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks undergo significant asymmetric broadening, and the
peaks gradually shift to lower BE values. A further increase of the
annealing temperature to 310 °C seems to result only in comparatively
minor additional peak broadening. This is somewhat different to what
can be observed for the O 1s spectra, here the most pronounced change,
indicated by an asymmetric narrowing of the main peak and a broadening
of the minor contribution toward high BE values, can be observed for
temperatures below 100 °C and above 200 °C, respectively,
with only minor changes in the intermediate temperature regime. Overall,
the spectral changes are less pronounced for the O 1s, compared to
the Mo 3d spectra, but can clearly be observed in the top panel of Figure 1b.

MoO3 is known to suffer X-ray beam-induced changes,20 however, measurement parameters have been optimized
at the beginning of the experiment to minimize these effects. In fact,
after this optimization, no indication of beam damage was observed
before and after the measurement sequence (see Figure S2) and thus, we clearly attribute the observed redistribution
of spectral intensity to the annealing (and not due to X-ray irradiation).

To quantitatively analyze the annealing-induced changes, the individual
spectra have been fitted (see Supporting Information for details and Figure S3 for selected fit spectra). For the
as-prepared MoO3 film, the spectrum can be reasonably fit
by a single spin-orbit doublet (Mo 3d5/2 located at BE:
232.5 ± 0.05 eV). Thus, the main oxidation state of molybdenum
in our sample is +6,21 which is in line
with a stoichiometric MoO3 film. However, the nonzero residuum
of the fit (see top left panel of Figure S3) suggests that the presence of a small amount of lower oxidation
state Mo cannot be excluded, in accordance with refs (18) and (22). At 120 °C, an additional
doublet located at lower BE (Mo 3d5/2 at BE: 231.6 ±
0.05 eV, see Figure S3) appears, which
increases in intensity with annealing temperature. This doublet is
ascribed to the +5 oxidation state of Mo.15 For annealing temperatures above approximately 200 °C, a third
doublet (again at a lower Mo 3d5/2 at BE: 230.7 ±
0.05 eV, see Figure S3) is required to
properly fit the Mo 3d line, which is ascribed to the Mo oxidation
state +4.23 In Figure S3, it can be observed that the Mo 3d contributions that represent
high Mo oxidation states gradually shift to higher BE values with
increasing annealing temperature, likely due to the gradual appearance
of the additional low oxidation state contributions at lower BE values.
At the same time, the spectral intensity of the low oxidation state
(i.e., Mo5+ and Mo4+) contributions increases
at the expense of the high oxidation state (i.e., Mo6+)
components. The most common explanation for the appearance of low
Mo oxidation states is the creation of oxygen vacancies and a related
charge transfer upon vacuum annealing.16

Based on the Mo 3d fits, the Mox+/Mototal intensity ratios are derived. As shown in Figure 2a, the Mo oxidation
state +6
contribution decreases with increasing annealing temperature from
almost 100% (at RT) to 65.4% (at 200 °C). At the same time, the
Mo oxidation state +5 contribution increases, explaining the gradual
broadening of Mo 3d spectra in this temperature regime. At even higher
annealing temperatures, additional Mo oxidation state +4 contributions
can be identified increasing to 23.1% at 310 °C. The fact that
the Mo oxidation state +5 contributions start to plateau at 240 °C,
while the slope of the Mo oxidation state +6 contribution decrease
is rather constant, indicates that in this temperature region, the
reduction process is dominated by the direct +6 → +4 oxidation
state conversion or the dynamic balance between the conversion of
+6 → +5 and + 5 → +4 oxidation states. Our finding is
in agreement with previous reports on MoO3 films annealed
in the N2 atmosphere.23 The
degree of reduction can be expressed by the [O]:[Mo] (surface) composition.
The [O]:[Mo] ratio derivation is based on the oxidation state contributions
to the Mo 3d spectra assuming a [O]:[Mo] = 3 for the oxidation state
+6 (i.e., MoO3), [O]:[Mo] = 2.5 for the oxidation state
+5 (i.e., Mo2O5), and [O]:[Mo] = 2 for the oxidation
state +4 (i.e., MoO2). From RT to 240 °C, the [O]:[Mo]
ratio changes from 3.0 (stoichiometric MoO3) to 2.7 (see
blue line in Figure 2a). Note that a similar loss (−10%) of oxygen is derived when
the O 1s (Figure S4) and Mo 3d (Figure S3) lines are used for quantification
and that our result is similar to that reported by Zhang et al. for
annealing in N2. They found that the [O]:[Mo] ratio also
decreases from 3.0 to 2.7 when raising the annealing temperature from
RT to 250 °C.23 It is observed that
below 100 °C (see Figure 2a), neither the [O]:[Mo] ratio nor the predominant Mo oxidation
state +6 changes significantly; most likely because the thermal energy
(even in combination with vacuum conditions) is insufficient to break
O–Mo bonds.

Figure 2 (a) Mox+/Mototal ratios
(left y axis) and the [O]:[Mo] ratio (right y axis) and (b) relative contribution to the O 1s line of
the studied MoO3 thin films as function of annealing temperature
as derived from the data in Figure 1.

For the curve fit analysis
of the O 1s spectra (see Supporting
Information, Figure S4), at low annealing
temperature, two spectral components are sufficient to get a reasonable
fit. The dominant peak at 530.54 ± 0.05 eV is in the BE range
that generally can be attributed to metal oxides, that is, MoO3.15 The smaller high binding energy
contribution O1 at 531.69 ± 0.05 eV is in a BE range that is
usually ascribed to (surface) −OH groups.15,24 As the temperature increases from RT to approximately 100 °C,
it can be observed that the high binding energy contribution gets
smaller (see Figure S4 and also indicated
by the narrowing of the O 1s peak visible in the 2D map in Figure 1b). Increasing the
temperature further, starting from approximately 200 °C, a third
contribution (O2) at 533.09 ± 0.05 eV is required for a reasonable
fit and component O1 increases again. This is accompanied by a widening
of the O 1s peak (see 2D map in Figure 1b). While the initial decrease of component O1 with
increasing temperature agrees with the attribution to −OH groups
(due to annealing-induced dehydration or desorption of surface −OH
groups), the subsequent O1 increase at higher temperatures indicates
oxygen in another chemical environment. Indeed O 1s contributions
of molybdenum oxide in this BE range are also often related to oxygen
present in molybdenum suboxides and the related distorted chemical
environment due to oxygen vacancies.13 The
spectral fraction of all oxygen components as derived from the spectra
in Figure 1b are displayed
in Figure 2b. While
the O-metal contribution to the O 1s line continuously decreases with
annealing temperature, the spectral fraction of O1 shows a shallow
minimum around 100 °C and a slight but steady increase at higher
temperatures. Thus, at low temperature, we suggest the O1 component
of the O 1s line to be mainly due to −OH groups, which dehydrate
or desorb with increasing temperature. The increase of the O1 spectral
fraction can then be explained by an enhanced presence of molybdenum
suboxides (or oxygen vacancies) increasingly formed at temperatures
>100 °C. This model is corroborated by the finding of increased
Mo5+ at annealing temperatures of 100 °C and higher
(see Figure 2a). The
onset of increased O2 component intensity of the O 1s line and the
appearance of Mo4+ in the Mo 3d spectra coincide (see Figure 2a,b), and so, we
speculate that the O 1s component O2 can be ascribed to (another)
chemical oxygen environment distorted by an even higher amount of
oxygen vacancies. The presence of different chemical oxygen environments
that appear at different concentrations of oxygen vacancies can be
explained as being due to the differing coordination of the oxygen
atoms at a molybdenum oxide surface. According to Tokarz-Sobieraj
et al.,25 three types of oxygen exist at
the surface of a molybdenum oxide: singly, doubly, and triply coordinated
oxygen. The limited surface sensitivity of our HAXPES measurements
and relaxation processes at the molybdenum oxide surface upon formation
of oxygen vacancies (as suggested in ref (28)) can lead to scenarios that would be in agreement
with the observed behavior.

The valence band (VB) region (Figure S5) was recorded during the in situ annealing
experiment. Due to the
low photoionization cross section of the VB states, the data has a
significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio than the 2D intensity maps
of the Mo 3d and O 1s lines in Figure 1. At first sight, no distinct spectral changes with
annealing temperature can be observed. However, close inspection of
summations of spectra derived by adding individual spectra in the
temperature ranges of 30–100 °C and 240–310 °C
depicted as blue and red spectra, respectively, in the top panel of Figure S5, reveals small but significant differences.
In the above-VBM region between 0 and 2.8 eV BE, increased spectral
intensity can be observed in the high-temperature sum spectrum (red
spectrum) compared to the low-temperature sum spectrum (blue spectrum).
A detailed evolution of these above-VBM (or gap) states is presented
in Figure S6 (left panel). Despite the
low signal-to-noise ratio, it seems that these states are not present
until the annealing temperature exceeds 165 °C, confirmed by
the quantified spectral intensity in the region between 3 and −2
eV (Figure S6, right panel), for which
an increase can be identified in spite of considerable variation.
At approximately this temperature, we start to find evidence for the
presence of Mo in an oxidation state of +4 (see Figure 2a). However, due to the insufficient signal-to-noise
ratio (in particular in the above-VBM region) of the data acquired
in the fast in situ measurement mode, it is not possible to exclude
the presence of above-VBM spectral intensity also for lower annealing
temperatures (see discussion below).

High-quality VBM spectra
of the as-prepared and annealed MoO3 film recorded before
and after the in situ experiment are
shown in Figure 3.
The individual regions in these spectra are discussed in detail in
our previous publication.20 The majority
of the spectral intensity (in particular between BEs of 10 and 2.5
eV) has O 2p character. Under both conditions, the VBM position as
derived by linear approximation of the leading edge is determined
to be 3.00 ± 0.10 eV below EF independent
of annealing, which is in agreement with VBM values reported for (nearly)
stoichiometric MoO3 films.15 Above-VBM (defect) states in the band gap are detectable but very
weak in the as-prepared MoO3 film. Greiner et al. suggested
that, from a thermodynamics perspective, even stoichiometric MoO3 can contain some defect concentration.21 After annealing, two pronounced above-VBM features with
local maxima at BE of ∼0.8 and ∼1.8 eV are detected
(indicated by the blue arrows). In transition metal oxides, these
(defect) states can generally be attributed to the partially filled
metal d band (in our case, the usually unoccupied Mo 4d-derived states).
However, the origin of these defect states is still under debate.
Many studies suggest that oxygen vacancies are the main reason for
these defect gap states. Greiner et al.,16 for example, differentiate between dilute (i.e., low) and nondilute
(i.e., very high) O vacancy defect concentration scenarios and attribute
d1 and d2 to singly and doubly occupied d bands
of Mo5+ and Mo4+ cations, respectively. While
our data of the annealed MoO3 sample seems to agree with
the nondilute O vacancy defect concentration scenario, close inspection
of the above-VBM region of the as-prepared MoO3 on a magnified
(×10) scale in Figure 3, showing spectral intensity in the d2 region,
however, contradicts the corresponding dilute O vacancy defect concentration
scenario. This points to a more complex explanation. The defect states
in MoO3/organic material structures, for example, are typically
explained by the charge transfer from the organic materials to the
MoO3 film or by interface states, rather than by the intrinsic
property of MoO3.26,27 Additional high-quality
spectra of particularly the above-VBM region as a function of O vacancy
defect concentration (i.e., Mox+/Mototal ratio) would be required to ultimately resolve this issue,
in the future.

maximum
(VBM) region of the as-prepared and annealed MoO3 thin
film. The above-VBM region of the as-prepared MoO3 thin
film is also shown on a magnified (×10) scale for comparison.
The linear approximation of the leading edges to derive the VBM position
is also depicted.

Experimental Section
Thin films of 50 nm MoO3 were deposited onto Au (100
nm)/glass substrates by physical vapor deposition (PVD) in high vacuum
condition (∼10–7 mbar) as in our previous
study of MoO3.20 For the transport
to the analysis tool, the MoO3/Au/glass samples were sealed
in the N2-purged glovebox directly connected to the PVD
system.

The HAXPES measurements were conducted at the high kinetic
energy
photoelectron spectrometer (HiKE) endstation located at the BESSY
II KMC-1 beamline at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materalien
und Energie GmbH (HZB).28,29 During the sample mounting
and loading into the analysis system, air exposure was limited to
<10 min. HiKE is equipped with a Scienta R4000 electron energy
analyzer and is operated in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions: base
pressure in the analysis chamber is ∼10–9 mbar. For the HAXPES measurements, the excitation energy was set
to 2003 eV (henceforth simply called “2 keV”). The pass
energy and energy step width were 200 eV (500 eV) and 0.1 eV (0.5
eV) for all the core levels (survey) scans, respectively. The binding
energy (BE) scales of the HAXPES spectra were calibrated using Au
4f reference measurements of a clean Au foil, setting the Au 4f7/2 core level line to be at 84.00 eV. The total energy resolution
of the core level spectra was approximately 0.25 eV. The inelastic
mean free path of the photoelectrons depends on their kinetic energy
and is around 3 nm in MoO3 for the considered photoemission
lines and excitation energy, that is, the signal contribution exponentially
decreases to <5% for 8 nm (for the O 1s line) and 10 nm (for the
valence band) from the sample surface for the measurement geometry
used here.30,31

First, high-quality HAXPES
data were taken on the as-prepared MoO3 film. Then, the
O 1s, Mo 3d, shallow core level, and valence
band energy regions were measured consecutively in a fast in situ
measurement mode while heating the sample at a rate of approximately
2 °C/min in UHV, covering a temperature (pressure) range from
25 °C (∼10–9 mbar) up to 310 °C
(∼low 10–7 mbar range) as measured by a type
N (Nicrosil-Nisil) thermocouple connected to the sample stage. This
in situ annealing was controlled by a resistive heater controller
(ZRHCN RHC, Vacuum Generator) unit, which regulates the current applied
to the resistive heater below the sample stage based on the thermocouple
feedback. For the acquisition of one Mo 3d spectrum, the total measurement
time is 36 s. Because the heating rate is rather slow (2 °C/min),
we consider the change in temperature over the course of the collection
of one spectrum to be negligible. Data acquisition continued after
turning off the heater until the sample cooled down to room temperature.
Finally, a full set of high-quality HAXPES data of the annealed MoO3 sample was collected. Note that at this point, the [O]:[Mo]
composition does significantly deviate from the 3:1 stoichiometry
of the as-prepared MoO3. We will nevertheless refer to
this sample as “annealed MoO3” in the following.

Conclusions
In this work, the chemical and electronic structure of MoO3 thin films has been in situ monitored by hard X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy during vacuum annealing. The VBM position was found to
be independent of annealing at 3.00 ± 0.10 eV below EF. However, broadening of the Mo 3d and O 1s spectra with
increasing annealing temperature is attributed to the formation of
Mo5+ and (for >165 °C) Mo4+ states.
At
the same time the [O]:[Mo] ratio decreases from 3.0 to 2.7. As a consequence
of the significant annealing-induced formation of Mo5+ and
Mo4+, an increasing above-VBM spectral intensity can be
observed attributed to O vacancy related gap states due to partial
filling of (initially unoccupied) Mo 4d-derived states. Therefore,
vacuum annealing is suggested as a simple approach to deliberately
tune the properties of MoO3 thin films.
