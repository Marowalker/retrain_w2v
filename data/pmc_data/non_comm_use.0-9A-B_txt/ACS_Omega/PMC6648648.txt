The discovery of borospherene B40 leads to a new beginning
for the study of boron chemistry and may lead to new boron-based nanomaterials.
Based on density functional theory, the structures, electronic properties,
infrared and Raman spectra, photoelectron spectra, and electronic
absorption spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) are
investigated. It is found that H2, HF, and H2O monomers can form stable endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O).
In addition, the calculated results indicate that the doped molecule
at the off-center location can relax to the center location within
the cage and the symcenter of the doped molecule is almost located
in the center of the cage. Unlike endohedral metalloborospherene Ca@B40, which is a charge-transfer complex between Ca2+ and B402–, natural population analyses
and chemical bonding analyses reveal that there is no significant
charge transfer of the doped molecule. The calculated spectra indicate
that doping of a molecule (H2, HF, or H2O) in
borospherene B40 can change the photoelectron spectra and
doping of a polar molecule (HF or H2O) in borospherene
B40 can change the spectral properties. For instance, the
addition of a molecule can increase infrared and Raman-active modes
and cause a red shift or blue shift of electronic spectra. These spectral
features can be compared with future experimental values of endohedral
borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O).

1 Introduction
After
the discovery of C60,1 boron
clusters have been investigated by many researchers and research
results show that boron clusters favor quasi-planar or planar structures.2−14 Furthermore, a lot of experimental research works and theoretical
calculations have been reported to investigate the electronic and
structural properties of different boron carbide nanoclusters, boron
clusters, tubular boron clusters, and boron sheets.15−29 In 2014, a B40– cage with D2d symmetry was produced via laser vaporization.30 The first B40– cage
is named “borospherene”. This experimental research
has aroused attention in boron clusters31−48 and doped boron clusters49−59 such as the experimental study of borospherene B39–;31 structural and chemical
properties of a B40 dimer and trimer,32 doped boron clusters (MnB16– and CoB16–),50,51 and anionic boron clusters Bn– (n = 11, 26–29, 33–34, 37–38);33−39 structures and properties of borospherenes (B40+, B42+, B440/–, and B46);40−44 structures and properties of metalloborospherenes (Ta@B23, Ag&B40, and Th@B38);52,53 and studies of small doped boron clusters.55−59

The cavity of C60 with a diameter
of 7.1 Å provides
a suitable environment for encapsulating the monomer. Endohedral fullerenes
based on C60 have attracted great attention due their potential
applications in superconductivity and materials science.60−63 The properties of the outer cage can be controlled by means of the
inner small molecule or atom.64 Based on
the arc-discharge method, endohedral fullerenes encapsulating a nitrogen
atom and rare gas have been synthesized.65,66 In addition, based on the molecular surgical method, endohedral
fullerenes M@C60 (H2O, HF, and H2) have been successfully synthesized.64,67−69 Similarly, can endohedral borospherene also show new properties?
The diameter of borospherene B40 is 6.2 Å, and it
is about 1.0 Å smaller than that of C60 (7.1 Å).
Similar to the endohedral M@C60, borospherene B40 can encapsulate a single atom or a small molecule to form endohedral
borospherenes M@B40. Endohedral metalloborospherenes have
been investigated by several theoretical studies.70−77 Theoretical calculations of M@B40 (M = Ca and Sr) indicate
that Sr@B40 possesses a perfect endohedral metalloborospherene
structure with the Sr atom at the center, whereas the Ca atom is slightly
off the cage center by 0.27 Å. Theoretical research works on
endohedral M@B40 (M = Sc, Y, La, Na, and Ba) indicate that
Sc, Y, Na, and La atoms all favor the off-center location in B40, whereas Ba favors the center location within the B40 cage.

It is worth noting that the hexagonal and heptagonal
rings of B40 provide the possibility to encapsulate a single
atom or
a small molecule inside B40. In addition, the successful
synthesis of (H2O)@C60, (HF)@C60,
or (H2)@C60 provides the first light of morning
to synthesize endohedral borospherenes M@B40. Herein, with
the aim to obtain a quantum chemical prospect of endohedral borospherenes
M@B400/– (M = H2O, HF, and
H2), the comparative studies of electronic structures and
spectral properties have been performed. The aim of the present work
is to provide a theoretical research of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2O, HF, and H2) in which the H2O, H2, or HF monomer
is encapsulated in the cage. The endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2O, HF, and H2) studied in this paper are, of course, merely model systems,
which may or may not be made experimentally. However, the calculated
results of these model systems can provide useful data to assist further
synthesis and applications of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2O, HF, and H2).

2 Computational Methods
Endohedral structures of M@B400/– (M
= H2O, HF, and H2) were obtained by two steps.
First, geometry optimizations were performed using the doped molecule
(H2O, HF, or H2) as a probe to be placed in
the cage. Considering the molecular symmetry, different positions
and directions of the doped molecule in the cage were selected. The
first geometry optimizations were performed using the PBE0, M06-2X,
and TPSSh levels with the 6-31G basis set. After the first step, the
last geometry optimizations and frequency analyses were performed
at the PBE0/6-311+G* level. Electronic absorption spectra and photoelectron
spectra (PES) were simulated with the time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-DFT) calculations.78 Adiabatic detachment energy
(ADE) was calculated as the energy difference between the optimized
anion and neutral endohedral structures. The vertical detachment energies
(VDEs) were simulated via ΔSCF-time-dependent density functional
theory (ΔSCF-TD-DFT).30,31,78 Chemical bonding analyses were performed using the adaptive natural
density partitioning (AdNDP) approach at the PBE0 level.79 All computations were carried out using the
Gaussian 09 software package.80

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structures and Electronic
Properties
Figures S1–S3 (Supporting Information)
present results of first geometry optimizations by placing the doped
molecule in the cage with different positions and directions. Computed
energy values of M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) show that the endohedral structure I is lower in energy than other endohedral structures. For
endohedral M@B400/– (M = H2 and HF), after geometry optimizations, the initial endohedral structures
can relax to corresponding structures I–V. For endohedral H2O@B40 and H2O@B40–, after geometry optimizations,
the initial endohedral structures can relax to corresponding structures I–IX. After geometry optimizations, the
doped molecule at the off-center location can relax to the center
location within the cage (the symcenter of the doped molecule is located
almost in the cage center).

To gain further discussions about
the endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O), further structural
optimizations and frequency analyses of endohedral structure I were performed. Optimized structures of endohedral borospherenes
M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and
H2O) are displayed in Figure 1, and ground-state parameters are summarized
in Table 1. It is worth
noting that symmetries of M@B400/– (M
= H2, HF, and H2O) reduce to D2 (H2@B400/–), Cs (HF@B400/–),
and C2 (H2O @B400/–), respectively. Frequency calculations confirm
the stabilities of these endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O)
by showing no imaginary frequencies. As given in Tables S1–S3, the bond length of the doped molecule
shows no change compared to that of the single molecule. However,
the B40 cage reduces the ∠HOH of the H2O molecule. Unlike Ca@B40, which is a charge-transfer
complex between Ca2+ and B402–,70 natural population analysis calculations
(Tables S1–S3) reveal that there
is no significant charge transfer of each doped molecule. However,
as shown in Tables S1–S3, the B40 cage causes weak electronegativity of the doped molecule
(the total charges on encapsulated H2O, HF, and H2 are negative) compared to that of the single electroneutral molecule
(the total charges on single H2O, HF, and H2 are zero). The slight electronegativity of the doped molecule is
the result of weak interaction between the outer borospherene cage
and the inner molecule.

The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and
the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) (see Figure S4) of endohedral M@B40 (M = H2O, HF,
and H2) distribute in the B40 cage. The HOMO–LUMO
energy gaps (Eg) of H2O@B40, HF@B40, and H2@B40 are
3.10, 3.10, and 3.13 eV, respectively. The Eg of B40 was simulated as 3.13 eV along with LUMO
(−3.27 eV) and HOMO (−6.40 eV).30 As shown in Table 1 and Figure S4, Eg of borospherene H2@B40 is evaluated
as 3.13 eV along with LUMO (−3.27 eV) and HOMO (−6.40
eV), which is the same as that of borospherene B40. However,
encapsulation of HF lowers the LUMO orbital energy level by 0.03 eV
and encapsulation of H2O lowers the HOMO and LUMO orbital
energy levels by 0.02 and 0.05 eV, respectively. Overall, the addition
of a H2O or HF molecule leads to a slight lowering of Eg of B40 by 0.03 eV. It indicates
that the addition of a polar molecule (HF or H2O) can decrease
the Eg and enhance the chemical activity
of the B40 cage. Similar to endohedral fullerenes; the
slight changes of energy gap for endohedral borospherenes are due
to the weak interactions between the outer borospherene and the inner
molecule.

To gain further insight into the stabilities of M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O), we analyzed
the chemical
bonding in the closed-neutral endohedral borospherenes M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O) via the AdNDP analyses,79 which were performed using Multiwfn software
version 3.4.81 For borospherene B40, AdNDP reveals 40 3c–2e σ bonds, 4 5c–2e π
bonds, 4 6c–2e π bonds, 8 6c–2e σ bonds,
and 4 7c–2e π bonds on the B40 cage surface.30 Similar to borospherene B40, for
endohedral borospherenes M@B40 (M = H2, HF,
and H2O), no 2c–2e bond is found on the B40 cage surface. However, encapsulation of object causes some changes
in the bonding pattern of the cage. AdNDP analyses (see Figure 2a) reveal 1 2c–2e bond
on the H2 and 40 3c–2e σ bonds on the 40 B3 triangles on the B40 cage surface. The remaining
20 bonds contain 12 π bonds and 8 σ bonds, which are readily
classified into 3 sets: 8 5c–2e π bonds at the top and
bottom of the cage (distributed symmetrically around the 2 6-membered
rings), 4 6c–2e π bonds on the waist (each 6c–2e
π bond on the 6 atoms between 2 7-membered rings, as shown in Figure S5b), and 8 7c–2e σ bonds
(each 7c–2e σ bond on the quasi-planar close-packed B6 triangles plus an adjacent boron atom, as shown in Figure S5c). AdNDP analyses (see Figure 2b) reveal 3 lone pairs and
1 2c–2e bond on the HF and 40 3c–2e bonds on the surface
of B40 cage. The remaining 20 bonds contain 12 5c–2e
π bonds and 8 7c–2e σ bonds, which can be classified
into 2 sets: 12 5c–2e π bonds (8 5c–2e π
bonds distributed symmetrically around the 2 6-membered rings that
are the same as the 5c–2e π bond distribution of H2@B40, and the other 4 5c–2e π bonds
on the waist that are similar to the 4 6c–2e π bonds
of H2@B40) and 8 7c–2e σ bonds
that are the same as 8 7c–2e σ bonds of H2@B40. Single 5c–2e π bond and a 7c–2e
σ bond of HF@B40 are shown in Figure S6. AdNDP analyses (see Figure 2c) reveal two lone pairs and 2 2c–2e
bonds on the H2O and 40 3c–2e bonds on the surface
of the B40 cage. The remaining 20 bonds contain 12 π
bonds and 8 σ bonds, which are the same as those of H2@B40. Single 5c–2e π bond, 6c–2e π
bond, and 7c–2e σ bond are shown in Figure S7. Overall, the 12 delocalized π bonds also
cover the cage surface, which is similar to D2d B40. It is similar
to D2d B40 in that there exists double (σ + π) delocalization
of the electron clouds on the cage surface, which renders stability
to the endohedral borospherene. Unlike Ca@B40,70 the bonding patterns further reveal that there
is no significant charge transfer. However, doping with the H2O, HF, or H2 molecule causes some changes in the
bonding pattern on the cage surface, especially causing the eight
6c–2e σ bonds to disappear and simultaneously increasing
eight 7c–2e σ bonds. Encapsulation of H2 and
H2O increases four 5c–2e π bonds and simultaneously
makes four 7c–2e π bonds to disappear. Encapsulation
of HF increases eight 5c–2e π bonds and simultaneously
makes four 7c–2e π bonds and four 6c–2e π
bonds to disappear. Such changes in the bonding patterns further reveal
that the perturbations of bonding patterns on the cage surface are
due to the weak interactions between the outer borospherene and the
inner molecule. AdNDP analyses reveal that doped molecules fail to
bond effectively with atoms on the surface of the cage and their interactions
show nonbonding properties. Their interaction mainly includes electrostatic
interaction and the interaction caused by electron cloud overlap.
According to the previous results, there is no significant charge
transfer of the doped molecule, resulting in weak electrostatic interaction.
Thus, the interaction caused by electron cloud overlap plays an important
role in the interactions between the inner molecule and the outer
borospherene cage.

3.2 Photoelectron Spectra
Photoelectron
spectroscopy (PES) is a useful detection technique to understand the
electronic structure of the cluster. Boron clusters and other clusters
have been successfully probed via PES and theoretical calculations.30,31 To facilitate future identifications of M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O), the adiabatic detachment
energies (ADEs) for endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) were simulated,
and then, we simulated the vertical detachment energies (VDEs) and
PES for M@B40– (M = H2, HF,
and H2O) via the TD-DFT method.30,31,78 ADE of anionic endohedral borospherene represents
the electron affinity of the corresponding neutral endohedral borospherene.
The neutral endohedral borospherene with large electron affinity can
easily capture an electron. ADEs of endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) are 2.29 eV (H2@B40–),
2.35 eV (HF@B40–), and 2.35 eV (H2O@B40–). Among the endohedral
borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O), H2@B40– and B40– have the same ADE (2.29 eV);
however, HF@B40– and H2O@B40– have the same ADE (2.35 eV). The calculated
results suggest that doping of polar molecules (HF and H2O) in B40 can cause a slight increase of the ADE.

The simulated photoelectron spectra (Figure 3) of endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) appear
similar to the simulated spectrum of D2d B40–,
except for the strong band at about 5.2 eV. The predicted photoelectron
spectra show that H2@B40– and
B40– have the same lowest first VDEs.
For M@B40– (M = H2O, HF, and
H2) and B40–, the energy gap
between the first and second bands is about 1.85 eV. The first several
bands of PES were used to distinguish boron clusters,30,31 so it is important to discuss these bands. The first weak peaks
originate from the simulated ground-state VDEs of H2@B40–, HF@B40–, and H2O@B40– at 2.39, 2.46,
and 2.45 eV, respectively. The simulated ground-state VDEs of M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) originate from the detachment of the electron from the α singly occupied
molecular orbital (α-SOMO). The second peak of each endohedral
borospherene comes from the second and third simulated VDEs at 4.28
and 4.36 eV for H2@B40–, 4.28
and 4.37 eV for HF@B40–, and 4.30 and
4.37 eV for H2O@B40–. The
second calculated VDE of each endohedral borospherene originates from
the detachment of the electron from β-HOMO – 1, resulting
in the first triplet state. The third calculated VDE of each endohedral
borospherene originates from the detachment of the electrons from
β-HOMO – 2. The 5th strong bands (5–5.4 eV) of
these endohedral borospherenes largely consist of the 20th to 30th
simulated VDEs. These calculated VDEs of each endohedral borospherene
originate from the detachment of the electrons from α singly
occupied molecular orbitals. The fifth band can be used to distinguish
the endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M
= H2, HF, and H2O) and borospherene B40–.

borospherene B40–. (a) D2 H2@B40–, (b) Cs HF@B40–, (c) C2 H2O@B40–, and (d) D2d B40–. The simulations were done by
fitting the distributions of calculated vertical detachment energies
at the PBE0 level with unit-area Gaussian functions of 0.05 eV half-width.

Figure 3a–c
and PES of borospherene B40– (see Figure 3d)30 indicate that encapsulation of a molecule hardly changes
the first to third bands of borospherene B40–. However, the simulated results show that encapsulation of a polar
molecule in borospherene B40– can increase
the ground-state VDE compared to that of B40–. The simulated theoretical spectra in Figure 3 are useful for the identification of endohedral
borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) by means of combined experimental and theoretical
comparisons. Like borospherene B40–,
if the photoelectron spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) are
measured, these simulated data are useful for the identification of
endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M =
H2, HF, and H2O).

3.3 Infrared
Spectra
Infrared spectra
of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M
= H2, HF, and H2O) are displayed in Figure 4; these spectral
bands can be classified into three regions: low-frequency band (0–1000
cm–1), middle-frequency band (1000–1600 cm–1), and high–frequency band (160–4500
cm–1). The highest frequency of each endohedral
borospherene is 4368 cm–1 for H2@B40, 4369 cm–1 for H2@B40–, 3704 cm–1 for HF@B40, 3591 cm–1 for HF@B40–, 3847 cm–1 for H2O@B40,
and 3828 cm–1 for H2O@B40–. These vibrational modes come from the stretching
vibrations of the doped molecule and are Raman-active modes. Among
these vibrational modes, the vibrational modes at 4368 cm–1 (H2@B40) and 4369 cm–1 (H2@B40–) are IR-inactive modes
and other four vibrational modes are infrared-active modes. However,
intensities of the four IR-active modes are very weak. The lowest
vibrational frequency for each endohedral borospherene is 161 cm–1 for H2@B40, 185 cm–1 for H2@B40–, 165 cm–1 for HF@B40, 181 cm–1 for HF@B40–, 129 cm–1 for H2O@B40, and 129 cm–1 for H2O@B40–. The lowest
vibrational mode at 161 cm–1 (H2@B40) originates from the bending vibration of the doped molecule
and is infrared inactive. The lowest vibrational mode at 185 cm–1 (H2@B40–)
originates from the bending vibration of boron atoms and is also infrared
inactive. The lowest vibrational modes at 165 cm–1 (HF@B40) and 181 cm–1 (HF@B40–) originate from the bending vibration of the
doped molecule and boron atoms and are infrared active. The lowest
vibrational modes at 129 cm–1 (H2O@B40) and 129 cm–1 (H2O@B40–) originate from the bending vibration of the
doped molecule and are infrared active.

Figure 4 Computed infrared spectra
of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M
= H2, HF, and H2O)
by the PBE0/6-311+G* method. (a) D2 H2@B40, (b) D2 H2@B40–, (c) Cs HF@B40, (d) Cs HF@B40–, (e) C2 H2O@B40, and (f) C2 H2O@B40–. The disconnected shaded
part represents the omitted frequency interval (without spectral data).

The sharpest peaks of H2@B40, H2@B40–,
HF@B40, HF@B40–, H2O@B40, and H2O@B40– are at 1273, 1284, 1268, 1280,
1265, and 1277 cm–1, respectively. These strongest
active modes of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) come from stretching
vibrations of boron atoms and are at about 1270 cm–1, which is almost same as that (at 1274 cm–1) of
the B40 cage.48 Due to the high D2d symmetry, B400/– cages have doubly degenerate vibrational
modes. Encapsulation of a molecule leads to the lower symmetry of
endohedral borospherene, and simulated results show that there are
only nondegenerate vibrational modes for endohedral borospherenes
M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and
H2O). The B40 cage encompasses 43 IR-inactive
modes. However, the D2 H2@B40 encompasses 33 IR-inactive modes and the D2 H2@B40– encompasses
32 IR-inactive modes. In addition, other endohedral borospherenes
M@B400/– (M = HF and H2O)
have no IR-inactive modes. These simulated results indicate that encapsulation
of a molecule can increase IR-active modes.

Figure 4a,c,e shows
that endohedral borospherenes M@B40 (M = H2,
HF, and H2O) have similar infrared spectra except for the
region at 1600–4500 cm–1. In addition, Figure 4b,d,f shows that
the main peaks for anionic H2O@B40– and HF@B40– are weaker compared to
those of H2@B40–. It is worth
noting that the infrared spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O) are quite similar
to those of B40 (see Figure S8a).48 However, Figure 4b,d,f indicates that only the spectral feature
for endohedral borospherene H2@B40– is quite similar to that of the B40– cage (see Figure S8b). These spectral
characteristics suggest that the polarity of the doped molecule has
an effect on infrared spectra and also give some information about
the identification and confirmation of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O).

3.4 Raman Spectra
Figure 5 depicts the Raman spectra of endohedral
borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O), the sharpest peaks of H2@B40, H2@B40–, HF@B40, HF@B40–, H2O@B40 and H2O@B40– are
at 1323, 1233, 1322, 1220, 1318 and 1105 cm–1, respectively.
These strongest vibrational modes originate from stretching vibrations
of boron atoms. Among the Raman-active modes, the typical radial breathing
modes of H2@B40, H2@B40–, HF@B40, HF@B40–, H2O@B40 and H2O@B40– are at 180/429, 185/434, 192/429, 181/432, 193/432,
and 198/438 cm–1, respectively, which are similar
to that (at 170/427 cm–1) of the B40 cage.82 The breathing modes are used to identify the
hollow structures in nanotubes. The small change of typical radial
breathing modes indicates that encapsulation of a molecule just induces
a small change in the B40 configuration. The borospherene
B4047,48 has 14 Raman-inactive modes;
however, there are 3 Raman-inactive modes in endohedral H2@B40 and other endohedral borospherenes have no Raman-inactive
modes. Figures 5a,c,e
and S6a show that endohedral M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O) and B40 have
similar spectral features. In addition, Raman spectra of endohedral
H2@B40– are similar to that
of dianion B40– (see Figure S9b). However, Raman spectra of endohedral HF@B40– and H2O@B40– are different to that of B40– (see Figure S9b). It indicates that doping
of a polar molecule in the B40– cage
can influence the Raman spectra of the B40– cage such as enhanced or weakened spectral bands.48

Figure 5 Computed Raman spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O)
by the PBE0/6-311+G* method. (a) D2 H2@B40, (b) D2 H2@B40–, (c) Cs HF@B40, (d) Cs HF@B40–, (e) C2 H2O@B40, and (f) C2 H2O@B40–. The disconnected shaded
part represents the omitted frequency interval (without spectral data).

Raman spectra, as a supplement
of infrared spectra, are useful
for the basis of identification of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O). The simulated spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O)
show that some vibrational modes have strong infrared activity or
strong Raman activity. However, some vibrational modes are weak (or
inactive) infrared-active modes or weak (or inactive) Raman-active
modes. Infrared activity is related to |∂μ⃗/∂Qi|2;83,84 here, Qi is the normal-mode coordinate and μ⃗ is the dipole moment. Raman activity is related to the polarizability
of the molecule. If the vibrational of a normal mode cannot cause
a change of dipole moment, the information for this mode cannot be
obtained in the infrared spectra. However, it may cause the change
of polarizability and we can obtain the information in Raman spectra.
The simulated Raman spectra can provide useful information to vibrational
assignments and spectral interpretation.

3.5 Electronic
Absorption Spectra
Finally,
electronic absorption spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) were simulated, as displayed in Figures 6 and 7 and 7. The B40 cage has only UV–vis
spectral bands (see the black line in Figure 6);47,48 similarly, one can
observe only UV–vis spectral bands of endohedral borospherenes
M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O). However,
the simulated results show that endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) have
several near infrared spectral bands between 800 and 4000 nm (see Figure 7). Figure 6 shows that endohedral borospherene
H2@B40 and B40 cage have the almost
the same spectral features; however, endohedral borospherenes HF@B40 and H2O@B40 have the same spectral
features. The results show that doping of polar molecules (HF and
H2O) in B40 can cause a slight red shift of
electronic spectra. Red and blue lines in Figure 6 represent the electronic spectra of H2@B40 and HF@B40; the largest excitation
wavelengths are 537 and 543 nm for H2@B40 and
HF@B40, respectively. The maximum absorption wavelength
comes from the electron transitions from HOMO to LUMO. The green line
in Figure 6 represents
the electronic spectra of H2O@B40. The maximum
absorption wavelength is 543 nm that originates from the electron
transitions from HOMO/HOMO – 1/HOMO – 2 to LUMO. The
black line in Figure 6 represents the electronic spectra of B40. The maximum
absorption wavelength is 535 nm that originates from the electron
transitions from HOMO to LUMO. The maximum band (500–600 nm)
of B40 contains the first four excited states that originate
from the electron transitions from HOMO to LUMO, HOMO – 1 to
LUMO/LUMO + 1/LUMO + 2 coupled with HOMO – 2/HOMO –
3 → LUMO. The computed results indicate that the maximum band
(500–600 nm) of each endohedral borospherene also contains
the first four excited states that originate from the electron transitions
of HOMO to LUMO, HOMO – 1 to LUMO/LUMO + 1/LUMO + 2 coupled
with HOMO – 2/HOMO – 3 → LUMO. Other absorption
bands of endohedral borospherenes M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O) originate from the higher excited states
that arise from the electron transitions of corresponding orbits.

Figure 6 Computed
electronic absorption spectra of endohedral borospherenes
M@B40 (M = H2, HF, and H2O) and borospherene
B40. The red line represents D2 H2@B40, blue line represents Cs HF@B40, green line represents C2 H2O@B40, and black line
represents D2d B40.

Figure 7 Computed electronic absorption
spectra of endohedral borospherenes
M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) and borospherene B40–. The
red line represents D2 H2@B40–, blue line represents Cs HF@B40–, green line represents C2 H2O@B40–, and black line represents D2d B40–.

For the closed-shell endohedral borospherenes M@B40 (M
= H2, HF, and H2O), the maximum excitation wavelength
(minimum excitation energy) mainly originates from the electron transition
from HOMO to LUMO. HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg) reflects the probability of the transition from the
ground state to excited state. The molecule with larger Eg can induce larger excitation energy and is difficult
to jump to the excited state. On the contrary, the molecule with smaller Eg can induce smaller excitation energy and can
easily perform electron transition. The simulated values of Eg are 3.13, 3.10, and 3.10 eV for H2@B40, HF@B40, and H2O@B40, respectively. Encapsulation of a polar molecule (HF or H2O) in B40 can increase the probability of the transition.
In addition, the same Eg of HF@B40 and H2O@B40 just reflects the same largest
excitation wavelength (543 nm).

Figure 7 presents
the electronic spectra of endohedral borospherenes M@B40– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) and
B40–. Like the neutral H2@B40, endohedral H2@B40–, and B40– have almost the same spectral
features; however, the simulation results show that encapsulation
of polar molecules (HF and H2O) can cause a significant
blue shift of the maximum absorption band. The maximum absorption
band (1500–4000 nm) of B40– comes
from the first two excited states that originate from the transitions
from α-SOMO to α-LUMO coupled with α-SOMO to α-LUMO
+ 1. Similarly, the computed results indicate that the maximum absorption
band (1500–4000 nm) of each endohedral borospherene also comes
from the first four excited states that originate from the transitions
from α-SOMO to α-LUMO, coupled with α-SOMO to α-LUMO
+ 1. The calculated electronic spectra of endohedral borospherenes
M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and
H2O) are useful for the electronic structure analysis.

4 Conclusions
The structures, electronic properties,
Raman and infrared spectra,
photoelectron spectra, and electronic spectra of endohedral borospherenes
M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and
H2O) have been investigated by the DFT and TD-DFT methods.
The calculated results suggest that H2, HF, and H2O molecules can form stable endohedral borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O).
In addition, structural research works suggest that the doped molecule
at the off-center location can relax to the center location within
the cage and the symcenter of the doped molecule is almost located
in the cage center. Unlike endohedral metalloborospherenes Ca@B40, natural population analyses and chemical bonding analyses
reveal that there is no significant charge transfer for the doped
molecule. In addition, natural population analyses and chemical bonding
analyses reveal the existence of weak interaction between the inner
molecule and outer borospherene cage. The calculated spectra suggest
that doping of a molecule (H2, HF, and H2O)
in borospherene B40 can change the photoelectron spectra
and doping of a polar molecule (HF and H2O) in borospherene
B40 can change the electronic, Raman, and infrared spectra.
For instance, the calculated photoelectron spectra show that doping
of a molecule (H2, HF, and H2O) in borospherene
B40 can lead to more bands. In addition, the addition of
a molecule can increase Raman- and infrared-active modes and cause
a red shift or blue shift electronic spectra. These simulated spectra
can be compared with experimental data of M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O). The borospherenes M@B400/– (M = H2, HF, and H2O) are useful for the applications of borospherenes such as molecular
device.
