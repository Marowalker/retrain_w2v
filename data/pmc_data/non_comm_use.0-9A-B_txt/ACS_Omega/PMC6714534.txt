In
the present exploration, a few Si–B–N derivatives
are derived to adsorb Li ions and CO2 gas molecules for
the potential application of metal–air batteries. The newly
derived structure’s bond lengths are as follows: Si=Si,
2.2 Å; Si–B, 1.9 Å; Si–N, 1.7 Å; and
B–N, 1.4 Å, consistent with the experimental results of
relevant structures. The stability of the newly derived structures
is examined by the atom-centered density propagation study by varying
the temperature from 270 to 400 K, and no structural variations are
observed throughout the dynamics. Li adsorption on the Si4B2 ring has the maximum binding energy of −3.9
eV, and the result is consistent with the previous results. The rings
with the 2:1 silicon–boron ratio provide strong adsorption
for Li atoms. The calculated maximum electromotive force of the newly
derived sheets is 0.56 V with the maximum theoretical density of 783
Wh/kg. Similarly, the maximum adsorption of CO2 on the
sheet is −0.106 eV, which is considerably higher than that
on graphene and its derivatives. CO2 adsorption has been
carried out in the presence of water molecules to investigate the
change in CO2 adsorption with the moisture (water) content,
and the results show no significant change in the adsorption of CO2 with moisture. However, water has a strong interaction with
the maximum interaction energy of −0.72 eV. Further, to explore
the potential ability of the sheets, each sheet’s edges are
examined as hydrogen storage expedient and the surface as an artificial
photosynthesis platform. The Si4B2 ring is more
favorable for the adsorption of H atom with the chemisorption of −7.138
eV. Similarly, all of the major UV-absorption spectral peaks fall
between 450 and 800 nm, which shows that the sheet can be used as
an artificial photosynthesis platform.

1 Introduction
The need for rechargeable batteries emerged in the early 1970s
when the oil crisis exposed the vulnerability of U.S. society, when
nonrechargeable batteries of a lithium anode and an organic-liquid
electrolyte were known.1 However, nowadays,
life on earth is probably inconceivable without rechargeable batteries;
still, plenty of quests and challenges are forbidden in energy storage
technology. The major challenges in developing rechargeable batteries
are high power and energy capacity with rapid charging/discharging
rates for several cycles.2 On the other
hand, abundance, low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness
are the main objectives to be kept in mind while designing a rechargeable
battery. Over the last decade, the word “environmental friendly”
has attracted increasing attention from the researchers due to the
human-forced climate changes by increasing the concentration of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. Every year, fossil fuel combustion alone
produces thousands of tons of CO2 in the atmosphere.3 Reduction of the CO2 level in the
atmosphere is as important as the social and economic development;
however, capturing and converting CO2 into a fuel is a
better idea to reduce fossil fuel consumption and consequently lessen
the global warming. This is not the first time that the word “metal–CO2 battery” is used, lithium and sodium have also been
examined in metal–air batteries.4 A primary Li–CO2 battery has high discharge capacity
of ∼2500 mAh/g at room temperature,5 and the Li–CO2 battery can be discharged and charged
reversibly for seven cycles with a capacity cutoff of 1000 mAh/g at
30 mAh/g.6

In recent decades, two-dimensional
(2D) graphene has attracted
researchers to work on new 2D electrode materials for energy storage
applications. The hallmark features of two-dimensional materials are
slit-shaped ion diffusion channels that enable fast movements of ions
through the membrane.7 In addition to that,
Li et al.6 have used graphene8 and carbon nanotubes9 as an air electrode, which enhances the discharge capacity above
14 000 mAh/g over 20 cycles. Further results showed that the
performance of battery increased with conductivity, large surface
area, and high electrochemical stability of graphene and carbon nanotubes.
Long Qie et al.10 have reported that boron-
and nitrogen-doped holey graphene electrode exhibits high reversibility,
low polarization, excellent rate of performance, and superior long-term
stability over 200 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A/g in
a Li–CO2 battery. These excellent properties shown
by two-dimensional graphene encourage the researchers to explore a
new class of graphene-like two-dimensional materials.

Besides
graphene, several classes of two-dimensional materials
have been widely explored and reported with high capacity as an electrode
material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The class of two-dimensional
materials comprising transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS21111 and VS211 has been reported
with high capacities of 335 and 466 mAh/g, respectively. Similarly,
transition metal dicarbides,12 metal nitrides,13 and metal oxides14 were also examined as electrode materials. In addition to that,
an anisotropic two-dimensional material called phosphorene, which
has been successfully isolated from phosphorus, has been proved as
a potential electrode material with ultrafast ionic diffusion and
low barriers.15 The two-dimensional counterpart
of boron called borophene16 and the hydrogenated
counterpart of borophene known as borophane17 are investigated as anode materials for LIBs. These kinds of fascinating
results are encouraging the researchers to explore a new class of
two-dimensional materials toward energy storage applications.

Analogous to graphene, Andriotis et al.18 designed Si2BN two-dimensional sheets based on extensive
ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulations. A monolayer
Si2BN sheet has a hexagonal lattice with sp2 hybridization and consists of Si, B, and N atoms in plane buckling.
The authors have reported that the Si2BN sheet has high
flexibility, high electron mobility, tunable band structure, and high
thermal conductivity. Further, the stability of the structure is examined
by molecular dynamics simulation, and the results confirmed the structural
stability up to 1000 K. Followed by this report, the Si2BN material has been computationally investigated as a hydrogen storage
substrate19 and high-capacity anode material
for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries.2 Both
authors highlighted the superior structural stability of the Si2BN material. Similarly, the optical properties of hybrid nanostructures
made by Si2BN have been explored in another study.20

Here, the Si2BN sheet is terminated
with hydrogen on
the edges and the structural modifications are carried out by rearranging
the structure of the atom in the hexagonal lattice. Symmetrically,
the Li-ion and CO2 gas adsorption behaviors of the Si2BN sheet and modified sheets are investigated. Further, moisture
is taken into account by adding H2O with CO2 to mimic real circumstances. The present predictions with the help
of density functional theory (DFT) show that the structural rearrangements
induce interesting electronic properties and adsorption properties.
This piece of work is fundamentally important as there are no known
precedents of CO2 adsorption on a Si2BN sheet,
structural modifications, and hydrogen termination in favor of metal–CO2 battery applications. To make the work more interesting,
the modified sheets are investigated as a hydrogen storage and artificial
photosynthesis platform. Interestingly, the obtained results show
that the modified sheets have the compatibility to work as a multi-energy-harvesting
device.

2 Result and Discussion
2.1 Geometrical
Investigation of Electrodes
The optimized structures of different
Si–B–N combinations
are shown in Figure 1, and the structural stability of each structure is confirmed by
frequency results, where no imaginary frequency has been found in
the graph, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting
Information). The proposed structures, denoted O (here, the original
structure of Andriotis et al.18 is denoted
O and modified structures are denoted M), have lack of in-plane isotropy
under threefold rotational symmetry. However, the structures keep
considerable amount of stress and distorted hexagonal symmetry due
to the particular decoration of lattices with three different types
of atoms.2,18 Both O1 and O2 sheets are those Si2BN sheets predicted by Andriotis et al.,18 whereas each Si4–B–N ring in O1 consists of either
N–N or B–B alternatively with the sequence of A–B–A
and O2 has a reciprocal sequence of B–A–B, as shown
in Figure 1. The average
bond lengths of O1 and O2 sheets are as follows: Si=Si, 2.20
Å; Si–B, 1.97 Å; B–N, 1.42 Å; and Si–N,
1.77 Å. A quick visual examination of M1 and M2 in Figure 1 can suggest the difference
between O1 and O2, where the neighbors across the Si–Si strip
are now B–N and N–B instead of B–B and N–N.
This alteration in the rings increases the electrostatic interaction
between B and N atoms, which would likely increase the stability of
the structure by reducing the total energy. Generally, the molecule
with the lowest total energy has the highest chemical bond energy.21 As expected, the DFT results have shown that
the total energy has reduced by 1.25 eV due to swapping of atoms and
the stability of the structures M1 and M2 has increased by ∼35
meV/atom. The results are consistent with the reports of Sandoval
et al.,22 and the reported higher stability
in the structure is 42 meV/atom. The average bond lengths of M1 and
M2 sheets are as follows: Si=Si, 2.22 Å; Si–B,
1.96 Å; B–N, 1.44 Å; and Si–N, 1.76 Å.
Similar to O1 and O2, M1 and M2 scuffle with two sequences, such as
A–B–A and B–A–B. Further, the Si–B–N
composition has been edited and named M3 and M4.

Figure 1 Optimized structures
of H-functionalized Si, B, and N derivatives
with different sequences, where M and O stand for modified and original
sheets, respectively. (a) Each Si4 ring consists of either two N or
two boron alternatively with the sequence Si4BN–Si2B2–Si4BN.
(b) Si2BN sheet with the reciprocal sequence of (a) such
as Si2B2–Si4BN–Si2B2. (c) Each Si4 ring consists
of boron and nitrogen with the sequence Si4BN–Si2B2–Si4BN.
(d) Reciprocal sequence of (c). (e) New sequence has been introduced
in the sheet, which consists of Si2BN–Si2B2N2–Si3B2N1&Si3BN2–Si2BN.
(f) Defect has been created in the Si2BN sheet, which results
in two pentagonal and two octagonal rings resembling the Stone–Wales
defect on a graphene sheet.

In the M3 sheet, a new sequence is included in the parent sequence,
where Si atoms do not direct form bonds with each other. Each included
formation consists of three silicon atoms, two boron atoms, and one
nitrogen atom;, similarly, the adjoining ring has three silicon atoms,
two nitrogen atoms, and one boron atom as shown in the Figure 1 (M3). The inclusion of new
rings in the structure did not change the planar nature of the sheet.
These kinds of structures are theoretically reported previously.22,23 To include more variety of Si–B–N combinations, the
exotic motif has threefold coordinated atoms, and it is connected
to pentagonal and octagonal rings as shown in Figure 1 (M4). The M4 structure is slightly bent
(nonplanar) because the nonvalance silicon atoms in the defective
rings have a stronger attractive nature that pulls the other atoms
strongly toward it and creates the structural stress. The bond lengths
of all of the structures are summarized in Table 1, where the bond lengths of Si–Si,
Si–B, Si–N, and B–N are consistent with previous
results.2,18,22 Especially,
the experimentally reported bond length of B–N is 1.45 Å24 and present investigation reports in Table 1 are exactly the same.
The parameters such as the area and perimeter of the rings play a
vital role in the adsorption mechanism. In the present investigation,
the calculated average area and perimeter of each ring in all six
sheets are summarized in Table S1. On the
hexagonal rings in O1, O2, M1, M2, M3, and M4 sheets (Si4BN: area (a), 9.9 Å2; perimeter
(p), 11.7 Å; Si2B2N2: a, 7.6 Å2; p, 10.3 Å; Si3BN2: a,
8.4 Å2; p, 10.8 Å; Si3B2N: a, 8.8 Å2; p, 11.1 Å; Si4B2: a, 10.6 Å2; p, 12.2 Å; and Si4N2: a, 9.5 Å2; p, 11.5 Å), the rings with more boron atoms and less
nitrogen atoms have the larger area and perimeter due to the larger
radius of the boron atom. As expected, the Si4B2 ring has the largest area and perimeter among the rings and the
Si2B2N2 sheet has the smallest area
and perimeter. The defective rings in the M4 sheet have Si2B3N3 octagonal rings with the area of 12.8
Å2 and perimeter of 13.1 Å; similarly, SiB2N2 pentagonal rings have the area of 4.4 Å2 and perimeter of 8.1 Å. To use the sheets in real-time
applications, the H atom has been terminated on the edges for the
prevention of edges from environmental radicals. Hydrogen is the simplest
atom in the known world, and capping on graphene has been proven as
a potential addition to adsorb other molecules. Thus, this is sufficient
to justify the hydrogen termination of edges in the sheets. The formation
energy of each ring is calculated by both Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE0) and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) levels of
theories, which are summarized in Table S2. The obtained results for Si–B–N rings are consistent
with the previous results.2,22

The atom-centered
density propagation (ADMP) matrix study has been
carried out to confirm the dynamical stability of each structure at
270.0, 300.0, 350.0, and 400.0 K temperatures. The total energy versus
time trajectories are plotted for 100 fs as shown in Figure 2. The obtained results from
the ADMP calculation show that there is no significant change in the
bond length of each atom in the different sheets at each temperature.
In the present study, an energy versus time graph is plotted for 400.0
K as shown in the Figure 2. The obtained energy versus time graph shows significant
energy fluctuations for all of the sheets, but the corresponding energy
fluctuations in the graphs are between 0.0001 and 0.00001 hartree,
which are well shown in the Y axis of the graph.
Corresponding geometrical variations in the sheets are not observed
throughout the simulation, and the negligible deviations in the energies
as shown in the graphs are due to the small fluctuation in the bonds
of edge-hydrogen atoms. These results show that the newly modified
sheets are stable within the temperature range of 278–400 K,
and they can be examined as an electrode material.

during the course of molecular dynamics, which confirms the stability
of the structures at 400 K. The lines and the respective Y axis scales are represented by the same colors.

2.2 Electronic Properties of Monomers
Due to
the absence of hexagonal symmetry in the originally reported
Si2BN sheet, π bands near the symmetry points are
degenerated.18 Further, p-orbitals of Si
and N atoms are the main contributors of (Fermi energy) EF states.18,19 From the previous reports, one
can understand the significance of investigation on p-orbitals in
the present discussion, and Figure 3 shows the contribution of p-orbitals to the total
density of states (TDOS) of each sheet. The band gap energies of the
O1 structure of 0.671 eV and of the O2 structure of 0.637 eV show
the sequential change as shown in Figure 1. A–B–A (O1) and B–A–B
(O2) have two different band gaps. Even though both O1 and O2 have
similar number of atoms present in the unit cell, sequential changes
imply different band gaps. Both O1 and O2 have the dominant contribution
of Si pz orbitals near the Fermi level,
but the difference is accumulated by the presence of B py orbital at −0.1 eV in O2, whereas O1 does
not have that influence of B py orbital,
clearly shown in Figure 3. The presence of B py orbital shifts
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) by 0.143 eV in the
O2 sheet. Similarly, shifting the B and N atoms in M1 and M2 pushes
the P states down around the Fermi level by deepening the density-of-state
(DOS) valley. Both the M1 and M2 TDOS approach zero near the Fermi
level, and this is clearly visible in Figure 3. A similar effect has been observed by Sandoval
et al.22 Stability of a structure can be
confirmed by the placement of Fermi level near the bottom of DOS,
and this confirms that M1 and M2 are more stable than O1 and O2. Results
in Section 2.1 are
in good agreement with this result. Like O1 and O2, M1 and M2 have
different band gaps due to the swapping of sequences. Unlike M1, DOS-M2
in Figure 3 shows the
dominant presence of Si py, Si pz, and N py orbitals
near the Fermi level. The M1 Fermi level is completely dominated by
the presence of the N py orbital alone.
The inclusion of new atomic formations in the structures M3 and M4
results in different kinds of electronic properties. The sheet M3
has four Si atoms with no direct Si–Si bond formation, and
these atoms dominate the LUMO level of the sheets, as clearly shown
by the frontier molecular diagrams in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). This domination reduces the band gap to
0.557 eV, which is the lowest among all six sheets; thus, it has the
highest conductivity among the sheets. Formation of pentagonal and
octagonal rings as shown in M4, Figure 1, pushes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and LUMO apart from each other to open up the band gap. In the pentagonal
rings, B and N are a bit closer than normal, causing strong electrostatic
interaction between them, which is sufficient to open up the band
gap. In other words, the stability of the structure is increased due
to the strong electrostatic interaction of B and N atoms.

Figure 3 Comparative
DOS diagram of the presented 2D materials reveals the
contribution of p-orbitals in each atom. Colored lines in the graph
show the particular orbital explicitly. The DOS and partial density
of states (PDOS) values along the x axis are given
in the same scale.

To deeply explore the
electronic properties of each structure,
frontier molecular orbital analysis is carried out. The HOMO and LUMO
values of each structure are summarized in Table 2. The O1 sheet has the HOMO and LUMO values
of −4.369 and −3.698 eV, respectively. The p-orbitals
of the boron atoms are the main contributors of HOMO (99.9%) and LUMO
(99.9%). In both HOMO and LUMO, the contribution of s-orbital is 0.07%.
HOMO – 1 and LUMO + 1 states are largely dominated by the p-orbitals
of Si atoms. In the case of the O2 structure, the p-orbital of the
Si atom contributes 99.8% to LUMO and the p-orbital of the B atom
contributes 99.9% to the HOMO. HOMO + 1 and LUMO – 1 states
are contributed by B atoms. The major contribution of B atoms in the
O2 structure slightly narrows the band gap. In the M1 sheet, the HOMO
and LUMO values are −4.881 and −3.517 eV, respectively.
The p-orbitals of B atoms are the major contributors in the HOMO and
LUMO. Similarly, HOMO + 1 and LUMO – 1 are contributed by the
p-orbitals of N and Si atoms. However, in the case of M2 sheet, the
p-orbitals of B and Si atoms are the major contributors in the HOMO
and LUMO. Similarly, HOMO + 1 and LUMO – 1 are contributed
by the p-orbitals of Si and B atoms. The M3 sheet has the HOMO and
LUMO values of −4.248 and −3.963 eV, respectively, where
the p-orbitals of B and Si are the major contributors of HOMO and
LUMO. LUMO – 1 and HOMO + 1 are contributed by p-orbitals of
Si atoms. The M4 structure has the HOMO and LUMO values of −4.963
and −3.693 eV, respectively. The p-orbitals of B and N are
the major contributors, and LUMO – 1 and HOMO + 1 are dominated
by p-orbitals of B atoms. From the obtained results, it can be concluded
that the major contributions in the HOMO and LUMO are from p-orbitals,
and the results are well correlated with the DOS and partial density
of states (PDOS) results. Interestingly, O2 (having a smaller band
gap than O1), M2 (having a smaller band gap than M1), and M3 have
small band gaps and all O2, M2, and M3 sheets’ HOMO and LUMO
contributions are made by p-orbitals of Si and B atoms.

Chemical reactivity, charge transfer,
and partial charge transfer
between the materials can be identified by the global indices such
as chemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity. The
feasibility of the system to exchange electrons with the environment
can be measured by calculating the chemical potential. The chemical
potential can be stated as the rate of change in energy with respect
to the electron number when the external potential is fixed.25 1  Here, μ is the chemical potential, EHOMO is the energy of the highest occupied molecular
orbital, and ELUMO is the energy of the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. Hardness is a measure of stability
in the presence of electricity or resistance of a molecule to exchange
electrons from the environment, whereas softness is the reciprocal
of hardness.26 2  where ņ
is the hardness, and it is
derived from Koopman’s theorem.27 3   4  S is the
softness and ω
is the electrophilicity of the materials.

Similarly, electrophilicity
is a tool to measure the reactivity
of the material. Hardness and softness are the parameters that can
explain the change of the chemical system with respect to electron
density, where the increase in hardness of a molecular cluster indicates
an increase in band gap and the increase in softness of a molecular
cluster indicates the decrease in band gap.28 In other words, electrophilicity and electron affinity are the most
anticipated parameters that can explain the capability of the material
to accept electrons. Specifically, electron affinity shows the capability
of the material to accept only one electron from the environment,
whereas electrophilicity is the measure of energy when the electron
flows between a donor and an acceptor.29 From the calculated parameters, as shown in Table 2, it is easy to conclude that M3 has the
highest electrophilicity of 28.1 eV and the smallest hardness of 0.27
eV. Similarly, M1 has the lowest electrophilicity of 12.9 eV and the
highest hardness of 4.1 eV. In other words, the material with small
band gap has higher electrophilicity and the material with large band
gap has smaller electrophilicity.

The two-dimensional structures
like graphene and silicene are homogeneous
and isotropic materials. Thus, it does not make sense if the sequence
of sheets is shuffled because the properties will not change. However,
the sheet that is examined has three different atoms buckled together
to form a two-dimensional sheet so that the sequential changes will
provide different properties, which are confirmed by the results in
the above discussion.

2.3 Adsorption of Li Ions on
Sheets
The
binding character of the Li ion on the surface of six sheets is determined
at eight different possible ring sites. In each ring, one Li adatom
is placed to check the binding energy and find out the most favorable
site of adsorption as shown in Figures 4 and S3. The adsorption
energies are calculated using the formula30 5  Here, Ea is the
adsorption energy, Ecomplex is the total
energy of the Li-adsorbed complex, Emonomer is the energy of the sheet, and ELi is
the energy of the lithium adatom. Adsorption energies of the Li ion
on the sheets are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The calculated adsorption
energies in Tables 3 and 4 are negative (E <
0), showing an exothermic reaction, indicating the attractive nature
of each surface toward the Li ion. Tables 3 and 4 show that adsorption
of Li adatom on the top of the Si4B2 ring is
more favorable for Li adsorption with the adsorption energies of −2.9
and −3.9 eV, which is comprehensively shown in Figure 5. The van der Waals radii of
boron and silicon atoms are 192 and 210 pm, respectively, which are
larger than those of the nitrogen atom (155 pm),31 which is the reason behind the strong adsorption of Si–B
rings than Si–N rings. These results are consistent with the
results of Shukla et al.,2 and the reported
adsorption energy on the Si4B2 site is −3.03
eV.

Figure 4 Adsorption of Li atoms on M3 and M4 sheets at two different positions
is shown (the other positions are shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information). The smallest distance between
the sheet and Li atoms is marked in the figures. It is visible that
Li adsorption on the M4 sheet bends the structure.

Figure 5 Comprehensive graph between adsorption energy of Li vs no. of atoms,
which exhibits the change in adsorption energy with respect to the
particular combination of Si–B–N. The maximum adsorption
energy has been found in 4-Si and 2-B atoms in the hexagonal ring.

a Each ring has been separately taken
into account to understand the adsorption energy of Li on a particular
combination of Si–B–N.

The adsorption energy of Si4B2 is higher
than that of the recently reported 2D borophene (with the adsorption
energy of −2.58 eV), where the adsorption energy is higher
in the presence of four silicon atoms in the ring buckled with two
boron atoms because of an increase in the strong electrostatic radius
compared to borophene. Similarly, P-doped borophene has −3.42
eV adsorption energy as reported by Chen et al.32 Silicene sheets have adsorption energies of −2.233 and −2.41 eV.34 Two-dimensional (2D) sheets like MoS2 and graphene have
adsorption energies of −1.75,35 −2.6,36 −2.5,37 −2.01,38 and 1.41 eV.39 By
comparing these previous results, it can be concluded that the Si–B–N
derivatives have the potential to be a good electrode material. Typically,
the stronger binding leads to a rapid loading process of ions with
small barriers. To study the barrier height, a graph has been plotted
using a localized molecular orbital locator, and it is shown in Figure 6. The localized orbital
locator (LOL) reveals the features of bonding as a function of electron
density, and it has the potential ability to distinguish atomic interactions
(such as covalent, ionic, and van der Waals) in the solid state.40 It is visible from Figure 6 that adsorption of Li on the O2 sheet center
(Si4B2 ring) has the minimum barrier height
of 13.4 eV among the other sheets, and the result is in good agreement
with present adsorption energy results. Further, a color-filled map
is plotted, using the localized orbital locator (LOL), in Figure 7, showing the delocalization
of electrons underneath the Li atom due to adsorption. The blue color
shows the presence of charge, and the dark blue color shows the depilation
region of charge. Mulliken charge analysis provides a good view on
charge transfer between the sheets and Li; from Figure S6, it is easy to conclude that the negative value
on the Li ion is due to the transfer of charge from sheets to Li and
the positive value on Li shows the transfer of charge from Li to the
sheet. The Li atoms on position 1 (P1, adsorption takes place on the
pentagonal ring) of O2, M2, and M4 sheets have charges −0.23e, −0.29e, and −0.29e, respectively. Similarly, Li atoms on P4 (on the octagonal
ring) of the other O1, M1, M3, and M4 sheets have charges 0.27e, 0.63e, 0.77e, and 0.23e, respectively. When adsorption takes place in the presence
of two silicon and two nitrogen rings, charges have been pulled from
the Li atom to compensate the electron deficiency in the ring.

Figure 6 Comparative
profile of the localized orbital locator between the
nearest atom of the sheets and the Li atom. The sharp peak on the
right side indicates the Li atom, and the sharp peak on the left side
indicates the nearest atom of the sheet. The in-between wide maxima
are due to the physisorption, and the maximum of the wide peak is
the barrier height, which is mentioned above each graph.

Figure 7 Projection of the localized orbital locator (LOL) on the surface
of Li-intercalated complexes. The dark blue region shows an electron
depletion region, and the red region shows the electron-concentrated
regions. The presence of light blue color in-between sheets and the
Li atom confirms the week interaction.

The stability of the lithium-intercalated complex sheets is examined
with global indices such as chemical potential, hardness, softness,
and electrophilicity, which are summarized in Table 5. The electrophilicity of sheets is changed
with the intercalation of Li atoms, where except for M3-P1 and M3-P2,
the entire sheet’s electrophilicity has increased and hardness
has decreased. The decrease in hardness shows that the Li atoms can
be easily detached from the sheets by applying an electric field.
The changes in electronic properties are due to the presence of Li
atom near the Fermi level, confirmed by the PDOS, as shown in Figure 8. This intercalation
of Li reduces the band gap, which is well exhibited by Figure 8.

of Li-adsorbed complexes and partial density
of states of the Li atom. In M3 + Li and M4 + Li, the Li atom is placed
at three different positions, and TDOS and PDOS have been plotted
for each position, with respective colors shown in the graph.

The parameters like specific capacity,
electromotive force (e.m.f)
or open-circuit voltage, and theoretical energy density of the battery
are very important to spell the electrode as a potential electrode
material. It is important to stress that the specific capacities of
the rings are comparatively higher than those of the recently reported
2D materials. The theoretical specific capacity is calculated from
the formula 6  Here, x is the number of
electrons involved in the electrochemical relation and F is Faraday’s constant with the value of 96 485.332
C/mol, and the value 3.6 is used to convert C/mol into mAh/mol. The
calculated values are summarized in Table 4. The calculated Si2BN specific
capacity is 1158.5 mAh/g,2 the considered
unit cell has Si4B2N2 and present
results in the Table 4 are consistent with that result. These values are higher than the
recently reported results of graphite (372 mAh/g),41 MoS2 (335 mAh/g),11 Ti3C2 (447.8 mAh/g),42 VS2 (466 mAh/g),11 black phosphorus
(432 mAh/g),43 borophene (620 mAh/g),44 P-doped borophene (1732 mAh/g),32 borophane (504 mAh/g),17 bco-C16
(558 mAh/g),45 TiO2 (200 mAh/g),46 silicene (954 mAh/g),47 and MgI2 (211.2 mAh/g).48

The electromotive force and theoretical energy densities are calculated
from the formula 7  where V is the open-circuit
voltage, Ea is the adsorption energy of
the lithium atom, n is the number of electrons involved
in the electrochemical process, and F is Faraday’s
constant. 8  Here, E is the energy density
of the battery and M is the mass of the electrodes.48 The results are summarized in Table 4, and these results are in good
agreement with the previous theoretical result.2 The results listed in the table show that the Si4B2 ring has the maximum open-circuit voltage of 0.56 V
with the theoretical energy density of 783 Wh/kg. The adsorption energy
is directly proportional to the electromotive force; hence, there
is no surprise that the Si2B sheet has the maximum electromotive
force among others. Similarly, the Si3B2N sheet
has the theoretical capacity of 0.41 V with the theoretical energy
density of 649 Wh/kg. Even though the SiB2N2 ring has the maximum theoretical density of 787 Wh/kg, it has 0.33
V due to the low adsorption (adsorption energy, −2.2 eV) of
Li atoms. From the results, it can be concluded that stronger adsorption
energy leads to higher electromotive force. Further, the rings with
boron and silicon provide considerably larger adsorption than silicon
with nitrogen rings. The silicon–boron ratio of 2:1 in that
ring provides good results, but there is a probability that 1:1 (Si3–B3) may be more effective than this one,
which is not examined in the present study.

2.4 Adsorption
of CO2
The
adsorption of CO2 has been carried out in two different
aspects. First, the CO2 molecule has been placed on each
sheet in perpendicular orientation and vertical orientation. Second,
moisture is taken into account by adding H2O molecules
on the sheets for a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism
in the environment. The adsorption height is calculated from the minimum
distance between the gas molecule and sheets. The adsorption energy
is calculated from the formula49 9  Here, Ea is the
adsorption energy of the molecule, Esheet+CO2 is the energy of the complex for the first aspect, Esheet+CO2+H2O is the energy
of the complex with moisture, Esheet is
the energy of the monomer, ECO2 is the energy of the CO2 gas molecule, and EH2O is the energy of the water molecule (used
for the second aspect).

The CO2-adsorbed sheets are
shown in Figures 9a
and S7, where all of the CO2 gas molecules prefer parallel orientation and slightly upward orientation
but none of the CO2 molecules have preferred perpendicular
orientation. This shows the attractive nature of sheet toward CO2. The C=O bond length in the CO2 gas molecule
has changed slightly, and the changes are around 1.55–1.60
Å. The adsorption energy of each sheet and its position are summarized
in Table 6. The adsorption
height of CO2 on each sheet varies from 3.0 to 3. 8 Å.
The maximum CO2 adsorption energy has been found at position
2 (P2) of M3, where the oxygen atom is attracted by the silicon atom
on the hexagonal ring. The CO2 atom on that particular
ring is attracted with the adsorption energy of −0.106 eV,
and the CO2 molecule is approximately 45° upward from
the plane of the M3 sheet. To find weak dispersion interactions between
the CO2 molecule and sheets, DFT-D3 corrections are carried
out at the PBE0/6-311+g* level of theory and the corresponding results
are summarized in Table 6. Adsorption energies calculated for all sheets increase and corresponding
adsorption distances are found to be decreased with the dispersion
corrections, but the obtained results in both DFT and DFT + D3 calculations
show that the M3 (DFT (−0.106 eV), DFT + D3 (−0.283
eV)) and M4 (DFT (−0.089 eV), DFT + D3 (−0.318 eV))
sheets have higher adsorption energy than the other sheets. The physisorption
energies calculated in these studies are approximately equal to the
adsorption energy of CO2 on graphene and its derivatives.
For the sake of comparison with the available literature, the adsorption
energy of CO2 on graphene and its derivatives by various
researchers are as follows: −0.269 eV (at graphene),50 −0.036 to −0.33 eV (on H-functionalized
pristine graphene),47 −0.04 to −0.05
eV (on H-functionalized Stone–Wales defective graphene sheet),51 −0.055 eV (on H-functionalized 555–777
graphene sheet),52 and −0.064 eV
(on the fluorine-functionalized graphene sheet).53 Two-dimensional (2D) materials like germene, silicene,
and borophene have the adsorption energies of −0.1154 and −2.31 (lithium-functionalized germene),54 −0.707,25 −0.11,25 and −0.96 (N-doped germene),29 and −0.15,55 −0.19,55 −0.59,56 and −0.7 eV (armchair silicene), respectively.56 The charge transfer between the sheets and gas
molecules is calculated from the Mulliken charge analysis, and it
provides a clear picture of donation and back-donation of charge between
CO2 and sheets. The positive values of the Mulliken charge
on CO2 as shown in Table 6 indicate that charges are transferred from CO2 to sheets. The molecular electrostatic potential difference
map in Figure 9b shows
a red color on CO2, which confirms the donation of charge
from CO2 to sheets.

Figure 9 (a) Optimized adsorption structure of
O1 with CO2 and
M1 with CO2. (b) Their respective electrostatic potential
difference maps are shown. Here, the red region shows the positive
and the blue region shows the negative Mulliken charges. Similarly,

respective electrostatic potential difference maps.

The comparative density-of-state
diagram in Figure S9 shows the contribution
of CO2 to the
total density of the sheets. For a proper understanding of the weak
interaction between the sheet and CO2 molecule, a partial
density of states of p-orbitals beneath CO2 sheets is plotted. Figure S9 shows that the total density-of-state
graphs near the Fermi level are broadened due to the intercalation
of CO2. Also, these p-orbitals are the main contributors
of the HOMO level. Similarly, very slight overlapping of the energy
states of p-orbitals and CO2 molecules at around −9
eV is visible in the graph. The small overlapping confirms the weak
interaction between the sheet and CO2.

The increase
in band gap between monomers and CO2-adsorbed
complexes is confirmed by comparing Tables 2 and 7. The band gaps
of CO2-adsorbed complex sheets O1, O2, M1, M2, and M3 are
increased 65, 19, 8, 2, and 10 meV, respectively, but the band gap
of the M4 sheet is reduced to 2.6 eV. Logically, an increase in the
band gap shows the structural stability of the CO2-adsorbed
complexes. M4 sheet’s stability has decreased when CO2 adsorbed on the defects and this is because the defective-ring bond
length has elongated beneath CO2 while adsorption has taken
place. Band-gap-dependent parameters “softness and electrophilicity”
are decreased and “hardness” of the material is increased,
and this shows the stability of the structure in the presence of an
electric field. From the obtained results, one can strongly conclude
that the Si2BN sheet and its derivatives have the potential
to adsorb CO2 gas molecules in an efficient way like graphene.
Further, Si2BN and its derivatives have the potential capability
to be used as an air electrode material for metal–air battery
applications and it can be used as a potential CO2 Sensor
too.

2.5 Adsorption
of CO2 in the Presence
of H2O
The H2O molecule is placed next
to the CO2 molecule, and both are placed parallel to the
sheets as shown in Figures 9c and S8. The presence of H2O with CO2 does not influence the adsorption of
CO2 considerably, and the H atom of the water molecule
forms a weak interaction with the oxygen atom in CO2. However,
compared to CO2, H2O is slightly deeper toward
sheet the, and this shows that H2O has a stronger attraction
toward the sheets. The adsorption energy, distance, and net charge
of H2O and CO2 are summarized in Table 8, and the table shows the positive
net charge transfer of both molecules, which confirms the electron-accepting
character of sheets. The calculated adsorption energies of CO2 and H2O together are summarized in Table 8. To analyze the exact interaction
energy of CO2 in the presence of H2O, two-body
counterpoise calculations are performed, and the results are summarized
in Table 9. The calculated
interaction energies of CO2 with the O1 and O2 sheets are
−0.032 and −0.033 eV, respectively. When adsorption
takes place, the adsorption distances between the O1 or O2 sheet and
the CO2 gas molecule are 3.62 and 3.60 Å, respectively.
Similarly, the interaction energies of CO2 on the M1 and
M2 sheets are −0.030 and −0.028 eV, respectively. Among
the six sheets, the M3 and M4 sheets have slightly higher interaction
energies of −0.040 and −0.046 eV, respectively. Further,
the adsorption heights of CO2 on M3 and M4 sheets are 3.01
and 3.72 Å, respectively. The obtained results show that the
sheets have higher interaction energy of −0.7 eV for H2O molecules. The molecular electrostatic difference map in Figure 9d confirms the charge
transfer between the sheets and gas molecules. The comparative density-of-state
diagram in Figure S10 shows the strong
interaction of H2O molecule delocalize the p-orbitals,
especially, the closest approach of H2O with O1 and M1
sheets (with the bond distance of 1.998 and 2.004 Å) enlarge
the beneath rings that compress the band gap. The interactions are
enforced by the Si4BN ring, where the p-orbitals of silicon
attract the oxygen of the H2O molecule strongly than other
rings. It has been confirmed by Figure S10, where the band gap is narrowed due to the major contribution of
p-orbitals near the Fermi level. Except for O1 and M1, the band gaps
are widened with the adsorption. At the same time, hardness increases
with the reduction of electrophilicity and softness.

the counterpoise
two-body correction with the formula EI = Ecorrected energy + EA + EB, where EI is the interaction energy, Ecorrected energy is the counterpoise corrected energy, EA is the corrected energy of the first element, and EB is the corrected energy of the second element.

From the obtained results, it can
be observed that the presence
of H2O did not influence the adsorption of CO2 molecule. One cannot compare CO2 adsorption energies
given in Tables 6 and 9 because Table 6 consists of basis set superposition error corrections,
but it is fair to compare CO2 adsorption distances between
both tables. Comparing Tables 6 and 8, it is easy to conclude that
the adsorption height of CO2 remains the same with and
without H2O. This highlights the adsorption capability
of Si2BN and its derivatives. Another conclusion from these
results is that Si2BN and its derivatives can adsorb H2O very strongly and that this material can also be used as
a potential H2O adsorbent.

2.6 UV-Absorption
Spectra: A Possible Artificial
Photosynthesis Medium
Mother nature has shown a way to devise
a system that has the capability of producing energy through the Sun.
Plants generate O2 and carbohydrates using sunlight, water,
and CO2,57 and the process of
splitting is shown in the equation below 10  In the plant’s photosynthesis system,
a pair of chlorophyll molecules excite and transfer an electron to
the acceptor, which reduces CO2.58 This type of mechanism can be used to produce two kinds of artificial
splitting. The first one is to split CO2 into O2 and carbohydrates (such as HCOOH, HCHO, and CH3OH) using
visible photons, which is performed by Inoue and co-workers.66 The second one is to split H2O into
molecular oxygen and hydrogen for renewable hydrogen energy, as shown
in the below equation 11   12   13  The
first conversion of water into molecular
H2 has been done by Yanagida and his co-workers in 1985.60 The primary goal of the artificial photosynthesis
system is to convert CO2 and H2O into solar
fuel within a single integrated system by the principle of photoconversion.61 Plenty of nanomaterials such as silicon nanowires,62 CdS nanodots,63 peptide
nanotubes,64 and graphene65 have been used as a photocatalyst system, but an efficient
photosynthesis system is still a concern. The electronic and optical
properties of the material can be tailored by reducing the dimensionality,
and it will induce the quantum confinement effect. Further, nanosheets
and nanoparticles have a high surface-to-volume ratio that provides
more chemically activated59 sites and more
light absorption through the separation of electron–hole pairs
as compared to their bulk counterparts.67 Another important character of an artificial photosynthesis device
is that the device should absorb visible photon from the Sun58 to produce induced-electron transfer.52 Thus, in the present study, CO2-
and H2O-adsorbed Si–B–N derivative’s
light absorption properties have been investigated by the time-dependent
(TD) DFT study.

The UV-absorption spectra are calculated for
ten states, whose dominant absorption wavelengths, oscillator strengths,
and excitation energies are summarized in Table 10. All of the absorbed wavelengths fall within
the visible regions, which shows that the sheets are capable of absorbing
the sunlight. The M1 sheet in the presence of CO2 has shown
the highest absorption peak at 562 nm with the maximum absorption
energy of 2.2 eV, and this shows that the sheet has a larger band
gap, which is confirmed from Tables 7 and 11. When the M1 sheet adsorbs
CO2 and H2O together, the absorption wavelength
further reduced to 550 nm with the absorption energy of 2.2 eV. This
shift toward the blue region shows that the sheet shows the hypochromic
effect when it adsorbs CO2 and H2O together.
Except for O2 and M2 sheets, all other sheets show the hypochromic
effect when they adsorb CO2 and H2O together,
whereas M2 and O2 sheets show the bathochromic effect when they adsorb
CO2 and H2O together. Figure 10a,b shows the shift toward the blue and
red regions when the sheets adsorb CO2 with and without
H2O. The Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn rules relate
the integrated oscillator strength of a material to the sum of electrons
in the structure. Further, the chromophores operate with the theoretical
oscillator strength limit of 1%.68 In other
words, stronger oscillator strengths show stronger absorption of UV–visible
light and the magnitude of oscillator strength approaches unity. The
oscillator strengths of M4 sheets are 0.44 (presence of CO2) and 0.524 (presence of CO2 and H2O), and
nearly more than 50% of electrons are transferred due to the impact
of photons, which indicates that the sheet with defects shows stronger
absorption of photons. Obtained UV-absorption results show that the
Si–B–N and its derivatives can be used as an artificial
photosynthesis platform. Further, small sequential changes between
O1 and O2, and M1 and M2 show different kinds of absorption mechanisms
with the presence of CO2 as well as CO2 and
H2O together. To understand the electron transition dynamics,
the transition density matrix (TDM) been has plotted in Figures 10c,d and S11 for the CO2- and H2O-adsorbed sheets. TDM images with higher diagonal values show the
charge variance and with higher off-diagonal values show the strong
coherence of the electron–hole pair. More spreading in the
charges is due to the delocalization of π electrons in Si, B,
and N.

2.7 Possible Hydrogen Storage
Expedient
Hydrogen fuel cells are the most efficient energy
carriers with 3
times more energy than that in liquid hydrocarbons.55,56 This significant character of hydrogen fuel cells to produce hazard-free
energy in a consistent manner enforces us to investigate them. In
the process of hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen storage is the important
phenomena and it has plenty of quests in it. The United States Department
of Energy (USDE) has set a target of 6.0 wt % gravimetric densities,69,70 and it is set to achieve the targets in light-duty vehicles with
0.040 kg H2/L with the volumetric capacity and the net
useful energy per system mass of 1.8 kWh/kg.71 Hydrogen can be adsorbed and stored on the surface of solid materials
such as graphene nano, nanotubes and etc. Physisorption of hydrogen
on nanoporous solid materials is advantageous because of reversibility
of the process and desorption kinetics. However, the major disadvantage
of physisorption is that it requires extreme conditions such as low
temperature (around −196 °C) and high pressure for high
quantity of storage. On the other hand, chemisorption is a formation
of strong bonds between the hydrogen atom and the adsorbent, which
is more suitable for hydrogen storage and transport for longer distances.72 Thus, in the present study, Si–B–N
and its derivatives are examined as hydrogen storage materials. The
nonhomogeneous structures of O1, O2, M1, M2, and M3 sheets have six
types of rings as shown in Table 12 and each ring’s edges are investigated as a
hydrogen binding site as shown in the Figure 11. The average bond lengths between each
atom and hydrogen atoms are as follows: Si–H, 1.5 Å; B–H,
1.19 Å; and N–H, 1.01 Å, respectively. Normal bond
distances of Si–H (1.48 Å),73 B–H (1.19 Å),74 and N–H
(1.01 Å) show that the bond distance of Si–H is slightly
enlarged when the silicon atom is bounded in the aromatic ring in
the presence of B and N. Logically, an increase in the bond length
shows the weak interaction of H atoms on the Si atoms. The binding
energy of hydrogen on each ring is calculated from the equation49 14  Here, BE is the
binding energy per hydrogen atom, Ecomplex is the energy of the complex, n denotes the number
of particular atoms, EB is the energy
of the boron atom, ESi is the energy of
the silicon atom, EN is the energy of
the nitrogen atom, EH is the energy of
the hydrogen atom, and nH is the number of hydrogen
atoms present in the system. The calculated binding energies are summarized
in Table 12, and it
shows that the Si2B2N2 ring has the
largest binding energy of −8.7 eV and the Si4B2 ring has the lowest binding energy of −7.1 eV. Further,
a comprehensive probability graph is plotted between the binding energy
of H and the number of atoms, shown in Figure 12, to exactly know the combination of Si–B–N
that produces minimum as well as maximum binding energy. From the
relation between recovery time and adsorption as shown in the below
equation 15  (where τ is the recovery time),
one
can conclude that the Si4B2 ring is more favorable
for the adsorption of H atom. Deobrat sing et al.19 show the physisorption of H2 molecules, with
the binding energy of 1.8 eV, on the surface of Si2BN.
In the previous work,49 graphene edges
are examined as hydrogen binding sites and the average binding energies
are higher than −25 eV. This shows that the edges of Si–B–N
derivatives are more suitable for hydrogen binding and storage than
graphene.

Figure 11 Each different ring edge is taken as a possible hydrogen chemisorption
expedient.

energy of H and the no.

to the particular combinations of Si–B–N. The maximum
adsorption energy has been found in 2-Si, 2-B, and 2-N atoms in the
hexagonal ring.

2.8 Gravimetric
Density
The gravimetric
density of each ring is explored to estimate the maximum storage capacity
of CO2, Li, and H adsorbed on the surface and edges. Nonhomogeneous
Si–B–N sheets have six different rings, and each ring
has a different combination of Si–B–N. Thus, each ring
is considered to examine the gravimetric density for CO2, Li, and H atoms. The gravimetric density is calculated from the
equation 16  Here, W is the gravimetric
density, MCO2/H/Li is the mass
of CO2/H/Li gas molecules, and Mcomplex is the mass of CO2/H/Li-intercalated structures. The
calculated results are summarized in Table 13, which shows that the ring consisting of
two silicon, two boron, and two nitrogen (Si2B2N2) atoms has the maximum gravimetric densities for CO2 (22.705 wt %), Li (5.798 wt %), and H (5.407 wt %) atoms.
For the adsorption of CO2, metal–organic frameworks
have been regarded as the best candidates with the weight of 48 wt
% at 298 K and 14 bar pressure.75 Similarly,
graphene derivatives have the maximum gravimetric uptake of 37.9 wt
% at 195 K and pressure of 1 atm.76 Other
graphene-like materials such as MoS2 have the CO2 uptake of 42 wt %,77 and Ca-embedded
C2N has the CO2 uptake of 50 wt % at 30 bar
and 23 wt % at 1 bar.78 In comparison,
Si–B–N derivatives show a good amount of CO2 uptake at room temperature and 1 atm pressure. The highest gravimetric
density of H atoms on the edges of defective and boron-doped graphene
is 3.145 wt %49 and Si–B–N
derivatives are far better than graphene defects. Other experimental
results of H uptake on the graphene sheets are 0.4 and 0.2 wt % at
77 K and 1 bar pressure79 and graphite
oxide and reduced graphite oxides show 3.1 and 2.7 wt %, respectively.76,80 Further, results in this investigation are approaching the USDE’s
minimum criteria for the hydrogen storage.69,70 The overall results of gravimetric density calculations show that
the derivatives of Si–B–N have the potential to store
CO2, Li, and H efficiently.

3 Conclusions
The Si2BN sheet predicted by
Andriotis et al.18 is modeled into four
different types. A slight
rearrangement of B and N in the sheets increases the stability of
the sheet. To understand the temperature-dependent structural stability
of the sheets, ADMP calculations are carried out at 270.0, 300.0,
350.0, and 400.0 K temperatures, respectively. The geometrical variations
in the sheets are not observed throughout the simulation, and the
results confirm the stability of the structure at 400 K. The electronic
properties of the sheets suggest the semiconducting nature of the
sheets, and the obtained results are consistent with the Andriotis
et al.’s result.18 To understand
the potential of the derived sheets to be used as an electrode material,
the adsorption properties of Li ion, CO2, H2O, and H are studied. From the obtained results, rings containing
B–Si are strongly attracting, especially, the Si4B2 ring attracts Li atoms with the adsorption energies
of 2.9 and 3.9 eV, respectively, and the results are in agreement
with the results of Shukla et al.2 The
Si4B2 ring has the maximum electromotive force
of 0.56 V with the theoretical energy density of 783 Wh/kg. Further,
the adsorption of CO2 molecule is studied using PBE0, HSE06,
and PBE0-D3 levels of functionals, and the results show that both
PBE0 and HSE06 results are similar. From the obtained results, it
can be concluded that, like graphene sheets, Si–B–N
and its derivatives have shown strong attraction toward CO2 with the maximum adsorption energy of −0.106 eV in PBE0 and
HSE0, but −0.381 eV in DFT + D3 calculations. From the results,
it is very clear that the PBE0-D3 results are considerably higher
than in the other two cases, and it seems that the D3 corrections
slightly overestimate the results. When CO2 is adsorbed
by the sheets, the C–O bond length slightly increases, and
they can be used as an artificial photosynthesis platform. Thus, UV-absorption
studies are carried out to understand the photon absorption properties
of the sheet, and the results show that the major absorption peaks
fall within the visible region (450–800 nm). Further, it is
very essential to understand the CO2 adsorption in the
presence of moisture for real-time applications, so the H2O molecule is added to the system. The addition of H2O
does not influence the adsorption of CO2, and interestingly,
H2O adsorbed well by the sheets with the adsorption energy
of −0.72 eV. Since H2O is a polarized molecule,
it is well adsorbed by the sheets, and the sheets could be used in
water purification and water splitting applications like graphene.
Finally, the H adsorption properties of the sheets are examined by
introducing H atoms in the edges of the sheets, and the edges are
highly reactive to chemisorb H atoms. From the interesting results
in this work, it can be concluded that there are plenty of probabilities
to rearrange Si–B–N on the rings, but in the present
study, very few fragments are chosen for the investigations. Up to
this point, this Si–B–N has the potential to work as
a sorbent material for both Li ions and CO2 gas molecules.
With tunable geometrical and electrical properties, the Si–B–N
has plenty of quests and exciting features to be examined in the future.

4 Computational Methods
Phenomenal upsurge on the experimental
frontier, on a parallel
track, computational predictions of materials has provided valuables
guideline for the experimentalist. The experimental verification has
preceded computational predictions of two-dimensional borophene,81 hexagonal-BCN,21 and
blue phosphorous,82 which can be regarded
as an illustrative example, which shows the importance of the first
principle predictions. In recent times, computational methods in terms
of formulating admirable predictions of energy materials have been
firmly established due to their consistency.83 Galvanized by the above results, all of the geometrical optimization
and electronic structure calculations performed in the present work
have employed the density functional theory approach with PBE084 and HSE0685 levels
of theory with the 6-311+G* basis set. The basis function Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE0) possesses 25% of exchange correlation and 75% of weighting
correlation, which are well suited for physisorption and weak and
nonbonded interactions.86 The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06) function includes a short-range exchange correlation, which
makes the system efficient for a larger molecular system with diffusion
function.85 Further, with PBE0, overestimation
of the band gap has been reported by many authors,87 whereas HSE06 has good agreement with the experimental
values. Thus, in the present investigation, all of the monomers are
optimized with both PBE0 and HSE06 levels of theories. To understand
the stability of each structure, atom-centered density matrix propagation
(ADMP)88 has been performed at the 6-31g
level of theory at four different temperatures (270.0, 300.0, 350.0
K, and 400.0 K). The adsorption simulations of Li and CO2 are optimized at the PBE0 level of theory. To find weak dispersion
interactions between the CO2 molecule and sheets, DFT-D389 corrections are carried out at the PBE0/6-311+g*
level of theory. The density functional theory (DFT and DFT + D3)
calculations in the present work are carried out by the GAUSSIAN software
package.90 Charge transfer calculations
are carried out by Mulliken charge91 analysis,
and a recent study92 revealed that Mulliken
charge analysis is as consistent as Bader charge analysis.81 A multiwave function source code is used to
calculate the density of states, partial density of states, and local
orbital locator diagrams.80
