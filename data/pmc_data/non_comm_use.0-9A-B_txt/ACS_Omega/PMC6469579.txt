Technologically
useful and robust graphene-based interfaces for
devices require the introduction of highly selective, stable, and
covalently bonded functionalities on the graphene surface, whilst
essentially retaining the electronic properties of the pristine layer.
This work demonstrates that highly controlled, ultrahigh vacuum covalent
chemical functionalization of graphene sheets with a thiol-terminated
molecule provides a robust and tunable platform for the development
of hybrid nanostructures in different environments. We employ this
facile strategy to covalently couple two representative systems of
broad interest: metal nanoparticles, via S–metal bonds, and
thiol-modified DNA aptamers, via disulfide bridges. Both systems,
which have been characterized by a multitechnique approach, remain
firmly anchored to the graphene surface even after several washing
cycles. Atomic force microscopy images demonstrate that the conjugated
aptamer retains the functionality required to recognize a target protein.
This methodology opens a new route to the integration of high-quality
graphene layers into diverse technological platforms, including plasmonics,
optoelectronics, or biosensing. With respect to the latter, the viability
of a thiol-functionalized chemical vapor deposition graphene-based
solution-gated field-effect transistor array was assessed.

1 Introduction
Whilst pristine graphene
is one of the most relevant materials
of the decade, several important shortcomings must be overcome before
it may step from fundamental physics to applied technology.1 In particular, the absence of an electronic band
gap and its extreme chemical inertness undoubtedly compromise its
use as an active element in electronic devices or hybrid structures.
Molecular functionalization of graphene can provide singular and advantageous
properties, and there have been many attempts via nondestructive methodologies
to furnish graphene with surface modifications whilst attempting to
preserve its extraordinary properties.2−5 Evidently for technological applications
in environmental operating conditions, such as those related to biosensing,
strong and stable molecular links are required, preferably via covalent
functionalization. The most common covalent functionalization methodologies
for graphene are chemical routes,6−8 mainly based on the reaction
between free radicals or dienophiles and the C=C bonds of pristine
graphene.9 However, although well-developed
wet chemistry routes may succeed to link many interesting functional
groups to the graphene surface, they usually fall short in their usefulness
either due to a low degree of functionalization or to extreme disruption
of the surface due to the harsh nature of the reaction conditions,9,10 resulting in graphene platforms where excessive defect concentrations
degrade the outstanding properties of graphene, thus limiting its
applicability.

Here, we use a new, recently reported strategy11 for the selective functionalization of graphene
based on
the controlled formation of atomic vacancies in order to obtain a
uniformly covered surface with a covalently bound spacer molecule
that is formed from the spontaneous bonding of p-aminothiophenol (pATP)
molecules at the vacancies. This results in the controlled decoration
of the graphene surface with active thiol moieties that can be directly
used to bond diverse nanoarchitectures to graphene. We show that although
the functionalization protocol is undertaken in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV),
the thiol functional moiety is robust and stable in different environments.
As a consequence, it can be used, for example, for the immobilization
of metal nanoparticles (NPs), particularly gold NPs (Au NPs) which
are known to show a high affinity toward the thiol group.12 The deposition of NPs on graphene sheets has
become a valuable strategy for coupling graphene with plasmonic nanostructures13 and shows promise for optoelectronic materials14,15 or in (bio)sensing16 or energy storage17 applications. The initial graphene substrate
generally employed is graphene oxide (GO), which although it is significantly
more reactive than pristine graphene, allowing the chemical binding
of the NPs to the surface via reduction of the GO and the metal salts,
this is at the expense of significantly degraded electrical and electronic
properties. Although recently a nonchemical Au NP decoration method
using laser ablation in liquids was reported,18 a GO substrate was still required to efficiently bind the NPs to
the surface.

On the other hand, thiol chemistry is an ideal
tool to couple a
wide range of molecular architectures, in particular biomolecules
through the formation of strong sulfide bridges.19 One example is nucleic acid aptamers,20 which comprise RNA or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides
selected in vitro from a vast library of synthetic random oligonucleotides21 that can bind with high affinity and specificity
to a given target molecule. Aptamer-based biosensors have recently
emerged as improved biorecognition elements and are increasingly used
in biotechnology, biomedicine, and environmental control.22,23 Moreover, several are the advantages of using graphene-based platforms
for biointerfaces,24,25 among them low noise, flexibility,
and more interestingly, that because of the electronic nature of graphene,
sensing and actuator materials are on the same device. This work opens
the door toward the integration of graphene as a sensing platform.

Finally, it is important to remark that whilst the UHV environment
provides highly controlled preparation of functional material surfaces,
these generally fail when exposed to the atmosphere. The 13 orders
of magnitude difference in pressure, commonly known as the pressure-gap
that separates the real world from the artificially defined world
of surface science, is a very difficult barrier to overcome. In this
work, both worlds are successfully combined. UHV protocols and characterization
techniques for covalent attachment and characterization of the process
are employed, and solution-based and atmospheric protocols are used
to incorporate technologically important nanoarchitectures (see Figure 1). These conjugated
NPs and biomolecules are representative examples of nanobiohybrid
nanostructures that may provide excellent platforms with wide applicability
in diverse scientific and technological fields.26

2 Results and Discussion
The mechanism mediating the functionalization of graphene has been
understood in terms of the extra charge accumulated in the broken
dangling bonds around the single atomic vacancies that selectively
oxidize any molecule containing an amino moiety (Figure 1, step1). When pATP molecules
are injected into the chamber in the gas phase (Figure 1, step 2), the N atom from the primary amino
group is incorporated into the graphene network (Figure 1, step 3). The nature of the
molecular bonding to the surface is covalent, as confirmed by the
S 2p and N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) core-level peaks
(Figure 2b) and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. The N 1s core level peak can
be fitted with a single component at 400.09 eV, in good agreement
with the values reported for N within the graphene network and with
a radical.11,27 The calculations show that the
molecule strongly binds within the surface lattice with an anchoring
energy (energy gain due to the saturation of the C dangling bonds)
of 12.21 eV after the reaction is produced, yielding a highly stable
final structural configuration (depicted in step 3 of Figure 1). The result of this process
is that the free thiol group of the pATP is exposed to the medium.
This is opposite to the process that occurs in thiol–ene click
chemistry routes, where the thiol group binds to the pristine graphene
surface.28−30 In our case, the wide and rich chemistry of the thiol
groups can be used to further attach other relevant structures and
molecules to the graphene sheet, either via S–metal bonds or
by the formation of disulfide bridges.20

(g) Top (inset) and perspective views of a computed 3D density-charge
redistribution function isosurface (with a positive value of |ρredist(r)| = +10–4 e– a.u.–3) for
the functionalized system. The density-charge redistribution function
is defined as ρredist(r) = ρtot(r) – [ρgr(r) + ρmol(−2H)(r)], where ρtot(r) is the total
electronic spatial density charge for the whole, once formed, molecule(−2H)@graphene
system, and ρgr(r) and ρmol(−2H)(r) are the total electronic
spatial density charges for the graphene with the single atomic vacancy
and the pATP(−2H) molecule in the geometric configuration they
adopt in the whole system, respectively.

The existence of a stable thiol group after steps 1–3
has
been verified by XPS spectra recorded on the same experimental system
where the functionalization was performed that means without exposure
to air. The S 2p core level peak, shown in Figure 2a, appears at 163.9 eV, confirming the presence
of the thiol moiety, which is easily differentiated from S dimers,
sulfur oxides, or other S-containing species. The XPS spectrum can
be fitted with a unique component with a spin-orbit splitting of 1.15
eV, indicating that all of the molecules are at the same chemical
state. Furthermore, these molecules were observed by scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) (on the same system where functionalization was performed)
to be well dispersed over the surface, Figure 2c, where the molecules appear as bright bumps
in the images with typical apparent heights of 2.1 ± 0.5 Å
(statistics over 150 protrusions), a value similar to that reported
for aminophenol.11

Figure 2d presents
a representative Raman difference spectrum recorded from a flat graphene
terrace of graphene on 4H–SiC, where the second-order modes
of SiC31 have been subtracted to reveal
the characteristic graphene bands. In the upper trace, which represents
the graphene surface prior to functionalization, very little evidence
for defect-induced modes was found, confirming the high quality of
the as-grown graphene layer, where G, 2D, and 2D′ bands appear
at Δν = 1585, 2680, and 3232 cm–1, respectively,
and the 2D/G ratio of ∼3.2 correlates very well with quasi-free
standing monolayer graphene.32,33 In the lower trace,
which corresponds to a pATP-functionalized surface, the defect-induced
bands D and D + D′ clearly emerge at around 1362 and 2962 cm–1, respectively, because of the included N atom of
the pATP that is sp3 coordinated inducing a distortion
of the graphene sheet. However, the 2D/G ratio remains little changed
at >3, attesting the structural integrity of the graphene sheet,
and
the incorporation of the N atom into the basal plane is an essential
part of this process.

In order to assess the effect of functionalization
on the electrical
properties, the pristine graphene and G-pATP surfaces were compared
via a magnetotransport method.34−36 The results indicate that the
density of carriers does change because of the charge redistribution
after bonding and mobility is reduced by a 24% (Figure 2f). At room temperature, there is a striking
change in the slope of Rxy resistance versus magnetic field when data from the pristine sample
are compared with data taken immediately after the production of G-pATP
(Figure 2f). This change
in the slope plot at low fields (±1 T) corresponds to a change
in the sign of the charge carriers from holes (with an estimated density
of 5.2 × 1014 cm–2) in the pristine
sample to electrons (with a density of 1.3 × 1014 cm–2) in the functionalized sample. These experiments
were performed on an epitaxially grown single-layer graphene surface;
therefore, the sign of doping is as expected. The effects of functionalization
are also visible in the highest level of noise apparent in the Hall
channel for the functionalized sample data. There is also a decrease
in the estimated mobility (2390 cm2 V–1 s–1 in the pristine sample and 1600 cm2 V–1 s–1 after functionalization).
Further, the G-pATP sample was measured again after 1 year storage
under ambient conditions, and the electrical properties, in terms
of charge carriers and density, were essentially preserved.

At such low surface coverage, neither Raman nor infrared spectroscopy
could detect the thiol functionalities; thus, their presence was assayed
in a liquid environment by dipping a functionalized graphene surface
for 1 h into a DTP solution.37 The free
thiol groups react with DTP forming 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide
and releasing 2-mercaptopyridine that quickly tautomerizes into 2-thiopyridone
(top part of Figure 2e). The formation of these compounds indicates the presence of free
thiols on the graphene surface giving a UV absorption maximum at λ
= 343 nm (molar extinction coefficient at 343 nm = 8080 M–1 cm–1), as shown in Figure 2e. The peak observed at 269 nm is associated
with unreacted DTP.38 Thus, we can confirm
that the pATP molecules are covalently anchored through the amine
group to the graphene surface exposing free thiol groups, which are
stable in air and available for subsequent reactions.

Figure 2g presents
the computed 3D isosurface for a positive value of +10–4 e a.u.–3 of the density-charge redistribution
function (defined in the figure caption) for the G-pATP system and
shows how the incorporation of the pATP molecule, via the doubly dehydrogenated
N atom within a single atom vacancy (SAV) of the graphene lattice,
induces a strong electronic charge spatial localization in the surroundings
of the incorporated N atom in a third-order symmetrical way (see the
circular inset in Figure 2g), which has been quantified by a Bader population analysis
to comprise 0.96 e–. This electronic charge accumulation
comes from both the rest of the anchored molecule (around 0.5 e–) and from charge depletion in graphene regions outside
the functionalization centers (around 0.56 e–).
Interestingly, the electronic charge depletion and redistribution
within the rest of the molecule breaks down the aromatic resonance
of the ring, and some electronic charge seems to accumulate in the
S atom of the thiol group. This charge accumulation potentially enhances
the reactivity of this group, thus positively favoring reaction at
the SH site of the anchored molecule. The effect of the solvation
has also been studied by DFT calculations. We have repeated some calculations
having into account the water solvation influence by the polarizable
continuum model (PCM) within the default self-consistent reaction
field method as implemented in Gaussian09.39 For this purpose, we have computed again the total energy of the
full molecule (−2H)@graphene system and of the graphene with
the single atomic vacancy and the pATP(−2H) molecule subsystems
by separate within the PCM model under water solvent conditions. The
result of the calculations yields an anchoring energy of 11.82 eV,
to be compared with the value of 12.21 eV without accounting the water
solvation environment. This small energy difference does not alter
substantially the robustness scenario of the bonding after the functionalization.

Once confirmed the robustness of the thiol-functionalized graphene
upon exposure to both air and liquid environments, we focus on its
capacity for conjugation to metal NPs or biomolecules.40

In order to couple metal NPs, we take
advantage of the strong and
well-studied S–metal bond that forms spontaneously and allows
to strongly and easily link any noble metal NP to the functionalized
graphene surface.41 For the technological
use of graphene/NP assemblies, the NPs need to be securely anchored
to a particular surface. The versatility of the present methodology
is well suited to this purpose, and many different types of NPs can
be robustly coupled to graphene. To demonstrate this, two types of
Au NPs of different origins were employed, described in Figure 3: NPs produced in a gold-salt
solution and capped with citrate and NPs produced using a multiple
ion cluster source (MICS) in UHV.42,43

showing Au NPs prepared by wet chemistry; (b)
size distributions, with the corresponding log-normal fits, of Au
NPs prepared under wet chemistry and UHV conditions obtained from
the heights of the corresponding dynamic-mode AFM images; (500 nm
× 500 nm) of the Au NPs deposited on graphene via (c) wet chemistry
and (d) under UHV conditions. Insets correspond to characteristic
surface profiles of Au NPs. Note that the lateral sizes of the NPs
are increased because of tip convolution effects.

Both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 3a) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images
(Figure 3c) of particles
prepared by wet chemistry methods show that these have a tendency
to aggregate, whereas those prepared in UHV (Figure 3d) remain completely isolated, with a low
diffusion on this substrate. In the latter case, no organic shell
or surfactants are required to avoid NP aggregation, which may prove
advantageous for some plasmonic or optoelectronic applications.

The particle size and size distribution also vary for both types
of NPs, as obtained from the AFM height measurements, undertaken in
order to avoid tip convolution effects that coarsen the lateral image
size. After measuring more than 50 Au NPs from each sample type, the
size distribution histogram in Figure 3b was obtained. An average NP size of 5.7 ± 0.6
nm was found for Au NPs prepared under UHV conditions and 14 ±
2 nm for those prepared by wet chemistry.

With regard to the density of NPs deposited, the top row of Figure 4 presents large-scale
AFM images for three different cases: Au NPs deposited on pristine,
nonfunctionalized graphene (column A), and Au NPs deposited on G-pATP
surfaces, following either the wet chemical (column B) or the UHV
physical (column C) route. The figure shows that more NPs are seen
in the functionalized surface, with 1.2 × 1010 cm–2 and 3 × 1010 cm–2 for chemical and physical deposition, respectively, than that for
the pristine G/Au system, with 4 × 109 cm–2, suggesting that the deposition of Au NPs is relatively enhanced
by the presence of pATP.

SiC/H/G-pATP substrate following the UHV physical route (see text).
Top row: as-deposited; Bottom row: after 1 washing cycle. Note that
the image sizes in (c) are smaller because of the lower Au NP size.

In most studies of decoration
of high-quality graphene with NPs,
these are simply deposited on the surface from solutions,44,45 although a recent study shows −COO–-modified
Au NPs electrostatically linked to graphene surfaces functionalized
via thiol–ene click chemistry, but NP stability or resistance
was not addressed.29,46 To test the binding strength
of the Au NPs to the G surfaces, the respective samples are subjected
to a washing cycle, the corresponding images being displayed in the
bottom row of Figure 4. Clearly, in the case of the pristine G surface, almost all of the
NPs were removed from the surface. However, for the G-pATP surfaces,
the density of NPs does not appear to change, within the statistical
error, after washing for both chemical and physical routes. This is
due to the high strength of the covalent link between the thiol group
and the Au NPs.

Furthermore, an important advantage of our methodology
is that
the number of available thiol moieties on the surface can be relatively
easily tuned up to a maximum estimated density of approximately 8
× 1012 cm–2, which would correspond
to approximately 0.1–1% thiol-functionalized surface.11 Thus, it is easy to control the typical average
separation between immobilized NPs. Finally, it is important to point
out that we have successfully linked Au NPs to graphene surfaces that
were functionalized 5 months earlier and stored under ambient conditions,
showing a high resistance of the G-pATP surface to ageing.

With
regard to the development of biohybrid interfaces, we have
also explored the suitability of the G-pATP surfaces to immobilize
an in vitro selected thiol-derived ssDNA aptamer with high specificity
for the recognition of a target protein, where we explored the possibility
of forming a stable disulfide bridge bond between the S atom of the
free thiol group of the pATP molecule linked to the graphene surface
and a terminal S atom present in the thiol-modified aptamer molecule.
In this respect, we employed a previously obtained 76 nucleotides-long
ssDNA aptamer with selectivity for the protein PCBP-2, a pleiotropic
protein that participates in a number of cellular processes including
transcriptional and translational regulation. We use the protocol
described in the experimental part to first produce an aptamer-modified
graphene surface and, second, to expose it to a solution containing
target protein molecules. The final dried surfaces are studied in
air using AFM, and a typical AFM image of the G-pATP/aptamer/PCBP-2
system is shown in Figure 5. Here, two different types of rounded and compact structures
were observed: some small ones with sizes in the 16–20 nm range
and a more reduced number of large protuberances with lateral sizes
in the 28–32 nm range, albeit the lateral sizes of all of these
features may be coarsened by tip convolution effects as well as by
the tip load. The different heights observed in the surface profiles
corresponding to the path 1-2-3 in the AFM image are shown in Figure 5b. Clearly, the smaller
structures show heights in the 0.5–1.5 nm range and likely
correspond to free aptamers bound to the G-pATP surface, whereas the
larger structures reach heights of 3 nm and can be assigned to aptamer/PCBP-2
complexes. Analysis of the heights of 400 features (not shown) like
those shown in Figure 5a presented two maxima at around 0.9 and 3.1 nm, corresponding to
aptamer and aptamer/protein structures, respectively. These data are
consistent with our experimental conditions in which an aptamer/protein
ratio of 10:1 was employed, and only a limited fraction of the aptamers
is expected to be bound to the target PCBP-2.

Figure 5 (a) 500
nm × 500 nm AFM image taken in dynamic mode in air
of G-pATP/aptamer/PCBP-2, after a washing step with selection buffer
(SB). The line profile connecting points 1, 2, and 3 in the image
is shown in panel (b). The image displays 0.5–1 nm-height and
16–20 nm-wide features (that can be assigned to free aptamers),
as well as a smaller number of 1.5–3 nm-height and 28–32
nm-wide features (corresponding to aptamers bound to the target protein).

It should be pointed out that
one of the added values of using
a biosensing system based on aptamers instead of antibodies is their
reversibility with temperature.22 The denaturing
temperature used for our aptamer (with a length of 76 nucleotides)
without compromising its integrity is 95 °C. Unlike antibodies,
which undergo irreversible denaturation above 37 °C, aptamers
can refold into their original, active conformations when optimal
temperature (in our case, 25 °C) is restored. Therefore, the
aptamer is fully denatured at 95 °C, and the target molecule
(in this case, the protein PCBP-2) is completely released, and then
the surface immobilized aptamers can be reused. The G-pATP system
is perfectly capable of resisting this temperature level, which allows
repeated reutilization of the same G-pATP/aptamer sensing platform.
It is important to note that the developed chemistry in this work
is perfectly capable of resisting this denaturation temperature.

The binding mechanism is different in both cases. In the case of
metal NPs, they are based on the strong affinity of the sulfur-containing
compounds for noble metal surfaces, specifically gold. The mechanism
of binding NPs to the functionalized G surface consists of a reductive
elimination of hydrogen of the S–H bond by the metal surface.
However, in the case of G-pATP functionalization with the thiolated
aptamer, it relies on the oxidation of both sulfhydryl groups reaching
a disulfide bridge.47 Gold-thiolate and
disulfide bond cleavage occur via reduction. Hence, the solvent would
only affect if it contains reductant agents, which is not our case.
Additionally, because basic pH could also promote gold-thiolate dissociation,
we employed pH 7.4 for the functionalization process.48 Finally, the strong affinity between gold and the thiol
group and the S–S bond strength guarantee the robustness of
the functionalization and binding processes, leading to the stability
of the different platforms developed in this work under the different
experimental conditions.11

2.1 Perspectives, a Platform for gFET
As it has been shown,
the presented methodology exhibits potential
applicability in two systems of broad interest, namely, metal NPs
and (bio)sensing. The use of gFET as sensing devices has shown certain
advantages in biomedical applications, such as described for PoC (point
of care) biosensing of biomolecules49 or
electrical brain recording.50 However,
for using the gFET as biosensors, the graphene channel has to be chemically
modified to graft bioreceptors that will detect the specific biomarkers.
In this specific application,50 keeping
the electrical performance after the functionalization procedures
is really important to ambition dual sensing applications, recording
and sensing biomolecules in parallel.51

In order to advance toward the implementation of these functionalized
graphene surfaces into devices showing electrical read out for (bio)sensing
applications, the impact of this controlled surface functionalization
methodology on the electrical properties of graphene needs to be evaluated.
For this purpose, we have fabricated and characterized prototypical
graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFET),52 which were measured before and after functionalization
with pATP.

Figure 6a shows
an optical image of a device consisting of a 25-transistor array,
where a series of single-layer chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-graphene
channels are connected by two metallic contacts, the drain and the
source, with a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) immersed in an electrolyte
solution, which is used as the gate terminal that modulates the conductivity
of the graphene channel. The image in Figure 6b shows a close up of one of the graphene
channels and the gold contacts of the transistor corresponding to
the area marked by a red cross in Figure 6a. A schematic representation of the device
is shown in Figure 6c. The standard electrical characterization is derived from the gSGFET
transfer curve (Figure 6d), where the drain–source current, Ids, is obtained as a function of the gate–source voltage, Vgs (−0.2–0.6 V), for a fixed drain–source
voltage, Vds (0.1 V). From this curve,
both the charge neutrality point (CNP), corresponding to the voltage
at the minimum Ids current and minimum of the curve, and the transconductance
(gm), corresponding to the slope of the I–V curve, can be evaluated. The latter, which is the derivative
of the Ids versus Vgs (Figure 6d), is related to the geometrical parameters of the transistor (width
to length ratio) and the graphene charge mobility. Further, the CNP
can be related to the doping of the graphene: a p-doped surface shifts
the CNP to more positive values of Vgs, whereas an n-doped surface shifts to more negative ones.53 This doping arises principally from the nature
of the molecules attached to the surface and the charges trapped near
the graphene lattice. The transfer curves (Ids vs Vgs) obtained before and
after functionalization for a 40 μm long gSGFET are shown in Figure 6d, where it can be
observed that the functionalization mainly affects the CNP, shifting
it to lower potentials, whereas the other parameters remain constant.
In Figures 6e–g,
the values of CNP and gm obtained before and after functionalization
are shown, as well as the variation evaluated for each transistor
before and after functionalization. The average variation in CNP observed
over the 25 transistors is 45.7 ± 9.8 mV, suggesting that the
molecular coverage on the surface does not induce a large doping in
the graphene lattice. The broad dispersion in gm observed in the measurements
before and after functionalization is due to the different channel
lengths of the transistors. From the results obtained, the gm after
functionalization is slightly reduced to a nonrelevant value of 0.401
± 0.340 m S, suggesting that the charge mobility in the graphene
lattice is unaffected by the process. Indeed, the small gm reduction
could be attributed to variations in the coupling capacitance, although
further evaluations need to be undertaken to fully assess this behavior.
Thus, it can be concluded that this is a valid functionalization strategy
to tailor the CVD graphene surface in a device with thiol-terminated
moieties, and it opens the door to versatile thiol chemistry to a
broad range of biosensing experiments using this type of devices.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we present
here a facile and controllable methodology
to decorate a graphene surface with covalently linked organic spacers
containing exposed thiol functionalities that can be employed in diverse
chemical linking strategies. In particular, we illustrate the linking
of metal NPs and aptamers, bisensor-relevant biomolecules, to a graphene
surface. This methodology opens the door to the growth of controllable
and stable nanobiohybrid structures on graphene platforms, with a
broad applicability in plasmonic, biotechnology, and biomedicine.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Graphene Surface Functionalization
Although we have employed several types of graphene surfaces, all
with similar results, most of the experiments reported were performed
on high-quality graphene layers epitaxially grown on 4H–SiC(0001)
by CVD with or without H under the superficial graphene layer. These
surfaces behave as quasi free-standing monolayer graphene, with Hall
mobility values above 8 >000 cm2 V–1 s–1.54 On the other
hand, the immobilization protocol has also been performed directly
on devices, where CVD graphene sheets were obtained by electrochemical
delamination and transferred onto SiO2 wafers.

The
main steps in the functionalization process are illustrated in Figure 1. The strategy used
to covalently link thiol moieties to the graphene basal plane was
adapted from a recently reported protocol used to couple para-aminophenol
molecules.11 It begins in the UHV chamber
by creating a network of single atomic vacancies on the surface via
gentle Ar+ sputtering of the graphene surface (Figure 1, step 1).55,56 The functionalization experiments were performed in situ in UHV
with a base pressure below 2 × 10–10 mbar.
In the first step, the substrate was degassed, followed by an annealing
cycle at 250 °C for 15 min to remove any physiosorbed contamination
from the surface. Vacancies were created in the graphene lattice by
bombarding with argon ions (Ar+) for 90 s using an electron-impact
ion gun. The acceleration energy of the ions inside the ion gun was
140 eV, the sample current was 1 μA, and the gas pressure during
this process was maintained at 1 × 10–7 mbar.
The sample was then annealed at 500 °C for 5 min. Before dosing
pATP molecules (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%), these were purified by
pumping with a turbomolecular pump (P = 10–8 mbars) for >6 h to eliminate any impurities. Subsequently, the
ion-treated
graphene surface was exposed to about 10 Langmuir of pATP (1 L = 10–7 mbar s). The G-pATP surfaces were either maintained
in UHV for further in situ reaction with Au NPs or removed from the
chamber and stored under ambient conditions for ex situ reaction with
Au NPs or aptamers.

4.2 NP Fabrication
Citrate-stabilized
gold NPs were synthesized according to the Turkevich method.57 The Au content in the samples was determined
by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES,
PerkinElmer Optima 2100 DVICP) after digestion of the Au NP suspension
with a mixture of HNO3:HCl (1:3 ratio v/v) and dilution
with ultrapure water. Graphene (1 cm2) functionalized with
pATP was placed into a small plastic vial containing 2.5 mL of the
aqueous suspension (0.1 mg Au/mL) of Au NPs and left, without agitation,
for 15 h. Next, the graphene sample was introduced into a Petri dish
in the presence of 5 mL of water and stirred in an orbital shaker
for 15 min. Subsequently, in order to eliminate any residues of unconjugated
Au NPs, the graphene surface was thoroughly washed with ultrapure
water. Finally, the washed sample was dried in an oven at 50 °C
for 2 h. The same procedure was applied to pristine, nonfunctionalized
graphene. The NPs on the graphene surfaces were observed by TEM and
AFM.

Au NPs were fabricated in UHV via a gas-phase synthesis
route using a MICS,43 equipped with three
1″ magnetrons. In this case, one of the magnetrons was loaded
with an Au target (99.99% purity). To ensure minimal contamination,
all gas pipes used to inject Ar (95.5% purity) are made of stainless
steel and vacuum-sealed. The MICS is connected to the main UHV chamber,
where the substrate is located, through a small orifice with a nozzle.
The distance of the sample to the MICS exit during deposition is 200
mm. The working parameters employed in the MICS for Au NP fabrication
were a power of 8 W; an aggregation distance to the exit slit of 70
mm; and total Ar flux of 100 sccm with an Ar flux through the Au magnetron
of 30 sccm. Once formed, the Au NPs travel through the vacuum to the
main chamber where they soft land on the surface of the substrate,
ensuring the absence of deformation of the Au NPs due to their low
energy.58 The base pressure in the system
was below 5 × 10–10 mbar.

4.3 Binding of Aptamers to G-pATP and Target Protein
Recognition
Aptamers are RNA or ssDNA oligonucleotides that
are selected in vitro from a vast library of synthetic oligonucleotides
(in general, from 1013 to 1015) with random
sequence21 using an amplification-selection
method termed “systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment” or SELEX,59 which can
bind with high affinity and specificity to a given target molecule.
Aptamers possess a specific three-dimensional structure in solution
that depends on their sequence and on the physicochemical features
of the folding buffer, including temperature, pH, ionic strength,
and concentration of divalent cations.

We have used a 76 nucleotides-long
ssDNA aptamer specific to the protein PCBP-2 (also known as hnRNP
E2 or CP-2), which is a member of the cellular heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein family that mediates relevant biological processes
including mRNA stabilization, transcriptional regulation, translational
control, and apoptotic program activation.60−62 Among the PCBP-2-specific
aptamers previously obtained and analyzed by means of a variant of
the SELEX process,63 we selected the ssDNA
aptamer with the highest affinity for the target protein, with a dissociation
constant Kd of 8.4 nM. It is termed 05DS10-21,
and its nucleotide sequence (5′ thiol-modified, purchased from
IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) is 5′-GCGGATCCAGACTGGTGTGGAGGTTAGCCGAAACACGTATACGCGTATTTATCCTCGGGCCCTAAAGACAAGCTTC-3′.
The recombinant protein PCBP-2 used as the target in this work (purchased
from Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) is a 362 amino acids-long globular protein
that includes a GST-tag at its N-terminal end (MW of 65.56 kDa).

The 5′ thiol group of the aptamer was introduced to establish
a disulfide bond with the free thiol group of the G-pATP. The terminal
sulfur atoms of thiolated DNA have a tendency to form dimers in solution,
especially in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, dithiothreitol (DTT)
was used as a reducing or “deprotecting” agent for thiolated
DNA. Typically, a 10 mM DTT solution in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 8.3) was mixed with a 100 μM thiolated aptamer solution
and allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature. Then, DTT was removed
by filtration using a 3 K Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter. Subsequently,
30 μL of the thiolated ssDNA aptamer (at 1 μM concentration
in selection buffer, SB, composed of 100 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4) was renatured (by incubation at 95 °C
for 10 min, and then at 37 °C for 10 min). The renatured, thiolated
ssDNA was deposited onto the G-pATP surface and left to react via
disulfide bridge47,64,65 in a humidity chamber for 20 min at controlled temperature (25 °C).
Then, the G-pATP/aptamer surface was gently washed with ultrapure,
DEPC-treated milliQ water, and finally air-dried. The aptamer-functionalized
graphene samples were subsequently incubated with 30 μL of a
100 nM solution (in SB) of recombinant PCPB-2 protein for 20 min,
in a humidity chamber at 25 °C. Then, the sample was gently washed
with SB to discard the protein molecules that could have nonspecifically
bound to the surface. Finally, the G-pATP/aptamer/protein samples
were AFM imaged in air, as previously described.66

4.4 Characterization Techniques
XPS was
undertaken at the PEARL Beamline of the Swiss Light Source. The beamline
produces a photon flux of 2 × 1011 ph/s at 1 keV on
sample. XPS spectra were fitted with an Igor Pro macro using Voigt
(Lorentzian and Gaussian) curve profiles. In all cases, a Shirley-type
background was subtracted from the raw data.

Raman spectra were
obtained in the Raman laboratory of the characterization service of
the ICTP–CSIC employing a Renishaw inVia Reflex-dispersive
Raman spectrometer incorporating a Leica microscope, using a 100×
(N.A. = 0.85) objective with a 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) laser power of approx.
2 mW at the sample surface, and multiple scans in order to obtain
adequate signal-to-noise ratios.

The in-air AFM measurements
were performed in the dynamic mode
with a Nanoscope IIIA (Veeco) system, an Agilent 5500 PicoPlus, and
a Cervantes system from Nanotec Electronica S.L. under ambient conditions.
We employed silicon tips with nominal force constants of 40 N/m and
softer silicon cantilevers of 2–4 N/m for imaging the aptamer/protein
complexes.

TEM measurements were performed using a JEOL JEM
1011 with a Gatan
ES1000Ww camera. TEM samples were prepared by placing one drop of
a dilute suspension of Au NPs in water on a carbon-coated copper grid,
and the solvent was slowly evaporated at room temperature.

Magnetotransport
was investigated over macroscopic dimensions (10
mm × 10 mm) in the square van der Pauw configuration using a
Quantum Design 9T PPMS (R) and press-on contacts from Wimbush Scientific
(R). Resistance measurements were collected in helium atmosphere (5
Torr) along the sample edges (xx and yy) and diagonal (xy) directions.

4.5 Theoretical Computational Methods
Physical and electronic
properties of the pATP molecules incorporated
within a SAV created in the graphene were using a set of accurate
DFT-based calculations by the plane-wave scheme implemented in the
QUANTUM ESPRESSO simulation package.67 All
calculations accounted for dispersion forces within the DFT + D approach
via an empirical efficient vdW R-6 correction.68,69 The revised version of the generalized gradient-corrected approximation
of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (rPBE) has been used to account for
the exchange–correlation effects,70 and Kohn–Sham equations were solved using a periodic supercell
geometry. Rabe–Rappe–Kaxiras–Joannopoulos ultrasoft
pseudopotentials71 have been adopted to
model the ion–electron interaction in the H, C, N, and S atoms.
The Brillouin zone was sampled by employing an optimal [4 × 4
× 1] Monkhorst–Pack grid.72 One-electron wave functions were expanded on a basis of planewaves
with energy cutoffs of 450 and 550 eV for the kinetic energy and the
electronic density, respectively, which have been adjusted to achieve
sufficient accuracy to guarantee a full convergence in total energy
and density.

4.6 gSFET Device Fabrication
and Testing
CVD graphene transistors were fabricated using
graphene layers grown
by a CVD process using a 25 μm thick copper foil of 99.8% metal
basis obtained from Alfa Aesar. The copper foils were cleaned with
acetic acid, then rinsed with deionized (DI) water, followed by cleaning
cycles with acetone, DI water, and isopropyl alcohol. The sample dimensions
were 6 × 5 cm2, and the growth conditions were 10
min at 750 °C, 2 sccm H2 and 5 min at 800 °C,
25 sccm CH4/H2. A 700 nm poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) layer was deposited on top of the graphene surface. The graphene
layer was separated from copper using an electrochemical delamination
process following the procedure described by Rosa et al.73 without the use of a frame. After transfer,
the layers were baked at 180 °C for 2 min and the PMMA was subsequently
removed by rinsing with acetone and isopropanol.

A Si/SiO2 wafer was used as a substrate. The first layer of Ti/Au metal
contacts was deposited by electron-beam vapor deposition and subsequently
structured by optical lithography. Then, CVD graphene was transferred
to the wafer using the process described in the previous section.
The graphene active area W = 40 μm × L = 2.5/5/10/20/40
μm of the sensors was then defined by oxygen plasma in a reactive
ion etching system. A second metallization layer of Ni/Au was then
evaporated and lithographically defined, followed by a lift-off step.
To electrically insulate the device, a 2 μm thick SU-8 epoxy
photoresist (SU-8 2005 Microchem) layer was spin-coated on top and
defined in such a way that only the graphene area was left uncovered.
The chips were finally individually cut.52

The electrical characterization was performed using a PA Suss
wafer
prober with an Agilent 41000 semiconductor analyzer. The graphene
transistors were in contact with an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M
KCl in phosphate-buffered saline solution. A reference electrode Ag/AgCl
was used as a gate.
