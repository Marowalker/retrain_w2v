Understanding metal oxide MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and Ir)–water interfaces is essential
to assess the catalytic behavior of these materials. The present study
analyzes the H2O–MO2 interactions at
the most abundant (110) and (011) surfaces, at two different water
coverages: isolated water molecules and full monolayer, by means of
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof-D2 static calculations and ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Results indicate that
adsorption preferably occurs in its molecular form on (110)-TiO2 and in its dissociative form on (110)-RuO2 and
(110)-IrO2. The opposite trend is observed at the (011)
facet. This different behavior is related to the kind of octahedral
distortion observed in the bulk of these materials (tetragonal elongation
for TiO2 and tetragonal compression for RuO2 and IrO2) and to the different nature of the vacant sites
created, axial on (110) and equatorial on (011). For the monolayer,
additional effects such as cooperative H-bond interactions and cooperative
adsorption come into play in determining the degree of deprotonation.
For TiO2, AIMD indicates that the water monolayer is fully
undissociated at both (110) and (011) surfaces, whereas for RuO2, water monolayer exhibits a 50% dissociation, the formation
of H3O2– motifs being essential.
Finally, on (110)-IrO2, the main monolayer configuration
is the fully dissociated one, whereas on (011)-IrO2, it
exhibits a degree of dissociation that ranges between 50 and 75%.
Overall, the present study shows that the degree of water dissociation
results from a delicate balance between the H2O–MO2 intrinsic interaction and cooperative hydrogen bonding and
adsorption effects.

Introduction
Rutile-like TiO2, RuO2, and IrO2 are isostructural metal
oxides with a large number of applications. As an example, they have
all been studied for energy conversion and storage from water oxidation
either photo- or electrocatalytically.1−6 Many of these applications imply the existence of a material–water
interface, whose understanding is crucial for the rationalization
of the global catalytic process. Therefore, the knowledge of the intrinsic
water–MO2 interaction as well as how this interaction
varies when increasing the water coverage is of high importance. In
this context, several works dealing with H2O–TiO2,7−17 H2O–RuO2,12,13,18−23 and H2O–IrO213,24,25 interfaces have been reported in the literature.
The obtained results allowed determining the different behaviors as
a function of the material and the exposed surface. However, some
controversy still exists on the amount of water that dissociates after
adsorption on the different surfaces and materials.7

Among the three materials, titanium oxide is the
most intensively explored
one. The most stable (110) surface has centered most of the available
investigations, which mainly focused on understanding whether water
adsorption on this surface dissociates generating H+/OH– species.7,9 The O-defective surfaces
have been observed to favor water dissociation, and thus, surface
preparation appears to be extremely delicate to determine the intrinsic
water–surface interface.14−16,26 Moreover, results are also sensitive to the experimental conditions
and techniques used for the analysis.9 In
this context, several contributions based on high-resolution electron
energy loss spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, infrared
reflection absorption spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) data are in agreement with water adsorbed molecularly on (110),27−31 particularly at low water coverages. Other experiments performed
at higher coverages with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
photoelectron diffraction techniques suggest that water partially
dissociates.32,33 The reader is referred to the
excellent review of U. Diebold for a detailed survey
of water adsorption on TiO2 surfaces, the performance of
different techniques, and surface preparation.34 On the other side, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
show that the energy difference between the molecular and dissociative
adsorption forms is very small and sensitive to the surface model
and level of theory used, particularly, the thickness of the slab
model, which exhibits an even–odd behavior, the DFT functional,
or the inclusion of the U Hubbard correction.9,10,13,28,35−40 This turns several contributions in favor of one or the other situation.
The influence of water coverage on the degree of water dissociation
on the (110)-TiO2 surface has been less addressed and most
of the calculations including a water monolayer or more suggest that
water adsorbs mainly in its molecular form.41,42

Although the interaction between water and the (011) surface
of titania has been much less studied, water adsorption at this surface
is also relevant because of its large contribution to the Wulff construction.
STM, X-ray diffraction measurements, and DFT calculations have shown
that the (011) surface suffers an important reconstruction when prepared
in ultrahigh vacuum conditions.11,43−45 This reconstruction is, however, reversed when exposing the distorted
(011) surface to liquid water and the original facet is recovered.11,45 From a computational point of view, calculations suggest that water
adsorption at low coverages occurs through the dissociative mode,
although increasing the water coverage to the full monolayer seems
to decrease the preference for the dissociative form.11,45−47

Ruthenium oxide has also been largely studied
and again most studies focus on the (110) surface.12,13,18−23,48 For this (110) surface, it is
accepted that at very low coverages, single water adsorbs on unsaturated
Ru centers, establishing an equilibrium between molecular and dissociated
water molecules.18−20 Moreover, STM and DFT calculations also indicate
that increasing the water coverage allows the formation of water dimers
that are adsorbed in contiguous unsaturated Ru centers.18,19,22 These dimers enclose one molecular
and one dissociative water, leading to the formation of H3O2– motifs or hydrogen-bonded (H3O2–)n chains at higher water coverages. The other (011), (100), and (001)
surfaces have only been studied in detail very recently.21,22 XPS, in situ surface diffraction, and DFT calculations suggest a
mixed molecular/dissociative arrangement at high coverages, the ratio
between the two forms varying depending on the surface. The two most
stable surfaces [(110) and (011)] are more prone to dissociate the
adsorbed water, whereas the (001) and (100) surfaces mostly present
the molecular form. In our previous paper,22 observed trends were rationalized by the combination of three factors:
(i) the intrinsic acid–base properties of each surface; (ii)
the presence of strong cooperative effects; and (iii) an increase
of the surface oxygen bridge (Obr) basicity by the adsorption
of water.

Finally, H2O–IrO2 interaction
has been much less studied.13,24,25 To our knowledge, only the adsorption of water on the most stable
(110) facet has been addressed by means of DFT calculations. Results
suggest that the interaction energy between H2O and IrO2 is significantly stronger than in the other two materials
and that the adsorbed molecules tend to dissociate.

With the
aim of analyzing how the nature of the metal oxide influences the
water adsorption and, in particular, the degree of dissociation, we
studied the rutile-like H2O–MO2 interaction
(M = Ti, Ru, or Ir) at the (110) and (011) surfaces, the ones that
contribute the most in the Wulff construction of the three materials,
considering two different water coverages: isolated water molecules
and full monolayer. Moreover, thermal effects and proton mobility
on the surface are analyzed by performing ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) of the full monolayer coverage. Results show that there are
three key factors for determining the degree of dissociative water
over the surface: (i) the H2O–MO2 intrinsic
interaction, (ii) the different octahedral distortion of TiO2 with respect to RuO2 and IrO2, and (iii) the
presence of hydrogen bonding and adsorption cooperative effects.

Results
and Discussion
As mentioned above, the main goal of this
paper is to compare the properties of MO2 (M = Ti, Ru,
and Ir) upon interacting with water. For that, we first addressed
the structural and electronic properties of the bulk and main crystallographic
surfaces. Second, we considered the adsorption of one single water
molecule at each of the two selected surfaces, with the ultimate goal
of comparing the intrinsic water interaction among the three metal
oxides. Third, we studied the water monolayer adsorption and evaluated
the degree of deprotonation in each case. For that, we carried out,
in addition to static calculations, AIMD simulations to address the
influence of thermal effects.

MO2 Bulk and Surfaces
All three considered metal oxides MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and
Ir) crystallize in a rutile structure, tetragonal with space group P42/mnm (see Figure 1a).49 Titanium dioxide exhibits two other (thermodynamically metastable)
crystalline phases in nature: anatase (tetragonal, I41/amd) and brookite (rhombohedral, Pbca). However, for comparison, the present work will only
consider the water adsorption on the rutile polymorph of TiO2. In the bulk structure, metal cations, M4+, show a distorted
octahedral coordination and O2– atoms display a
trigonal planar environment. Main distances, cell parameters, and
computed net charges of the metal and oxygen atoms for the three metal
oxides are given in Table 1.

Concerning the bulk, it can be observed
that both M–O distances and cell parameters are in very good
agreement with the experimentally determined values,49 deviations being less than 1.5%. The M–O distances
range between 1.95 and 2.01 Å, and the largest ones correspond
to IrO2, as expected. As found experimentally, Ti4+ exhibits a distorted octahedral environment with four shorter Ti–O
distances in the equatorial plane and two longer Ti–O axial
distances (tetragonal elongation), whereas the opposite situation
with four longer equatorial M–O distances and two shorter axial
ones (tetragonal compression) is observed for RuO2 and
IrO2. These differences may be related to the electronic
configuration of the metal in each metal oxide. That is, the electronic
configuration of Ti is 4s23d2, that of Ru is
5s24d6, and that of Ir 6s15d8. Although the metal ion can be formally considered as M4+ and thus there are no d electrons in Ti4+, Ru4+ has four d electrons, and Ir4+ has five d electrons,
there is a certain covalent character, and in an octahedral ligand
field, this can lead to different geometrical distortions for early
and late transition metals. Furthermore, for both RuO2 and
IrO2, spin-polarized Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)-D calculations indicate that magnetization of each metal ion
is equal to zero, as found previously at this level of theory.50−52 Finally, and as expected, computed charges indicate that TiO2 is significantly more ionic than RuO2 and IrO2.

Slab models for different crystallographic orientations
[(110), (011), (100), and (001)] were built cutting out the slab from
the optimized bulk structure. Surface energies, main M–O distances
of the outermost layer, and net atomic charges are given in Table 2. Values corresponding
to the internal layers are very similar to the bulk values and thus
have not been included and will not be discussed further.

In all cases, bulk cutting
to generate slab models leads to two-coordinated bridging oxygen Obr at the surface, as well as five-coordinated M5c sites for (110), (011), and (100) and four-coordinated M4c for (001). The vacant site of M5c in the (110) and (100)
surfaces is axial, whereas the vacant site of M5c in the
(011) surface is equatorial. For the M4c sites in the (001)
facet, both vacant sites are equatorial. Surface M–O distances
corresponding to unsaturated M sites vary depending on the coordination
environment, the shortest values being found for the axial M4c–O bonds of the (001) surface. M–M distances largely
vary depending on the crystal facet and range between 3 and 4.5 Å.
For all materials, the shorter values are found in the (110) and (100)
surfaces, whereas the larger ones are found for (001).

Computed
values for the surface energies are similar to those previously reported
in the literature and follow the same trend.53 That is, the smallest surface energy corresponds to the (110) facet,
whereas the largest one corresponds to the (001) one with M4c unsaturated metal centers. The remaining two surfaces show intermediate
values, and their relative order depends on the material. For TiO2, (100) is more stable than the (011) one, whereas for RuO2 and IrO2, the relative stability is reversed.
Despite that, the contribution of the (100) surface to the TiO2 Wulff shape is zero, whereas (011) accounts for 29.3% because
of symmetry equivalences. Overall, it can be observed in Figure 2 and Table 2 that the (110) and (011) facets
contribute by more than an 80% of the total surface, and thus, these
two surfaces are the ones considered to analyze the water adsorption.

Ti, Ru, and Ir).

Adsorption of Isolated
Water Molecules
As mentioned above, the aim of the present
work is to get insights into the different behavior of MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and Ir) upon interacting with water. For that, we first
studied the adsorption of a single water molecule onto the two surfaces
that contribute the most to the Wulff shape (Figure 2): the (110) and (011) surfaces (Figure 1B). This corresponds
to a water coverage of 1/4 for (110) and of 1/8 for (011). The preferred
adsorption configuration at the (110) and (011) surfaces of MO2 is that in which the water molecule binds through its O atom
with the undercoordinated M5c sites.10 This interaction increases the water acidity, leading to
the formation of a hydrogen bond between one H atom of the water molecule
and the nearest undercoordinated Obr. This interaction
can also lead to a dissociative OH–/H+ adsorbed form, with water deprotonated and the Obr protonated.
Thus, both adsorbed forms, molecular (mol) and dissociative
(diss), have been considered in each of the two surfaces
(see Figure 3). Adsorption
energies, relative stabilities between the two forms, and main structural
parameters are given in Table 3.

Regarding the (110) surface, both the molecular and
dissociative minima were localized for TiO2 and RuO2, whereas only the adsorbed dissociative form was located
in the case of IrO2 in agreement with previous calculations.9,13,18 Indeed, all attempts to optimize
the molecular adsorbed minimum collapsed to the dissociative adsorbed
species. Furthermore, results show that while the molecular form is
more stable for TiO2, the dissociative form is more stable
for RuO2 and the only minimum for IrO2. This
is related to the strength of the M–H2O interaction,
which follows the trend: H2O–TiO2 <
H2O–RuO2 < H2O–IrO2; that is, the adsorption energy increases (in absolute value)
from TiO2 to IrO2. As a consequence, the acidity
of the water molecule upon interacting with the undercoordinated M5c sites of the surface exhibits a larger increase when it
is adsorbed on IrO2 than on RuO2 or on TiO2. This is in agreement with the computed charge of the water
molecule in H2O–MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and
Ir), which increases from M = Ti to Ir. Thus, despite the higher basicity
of Obr in TiO2, as indicated by the net atomic
charge of Obr (Table 3) and the density of states (DOS), which shows that
p bands of Obr in TiO2 lie at higher energy
(see Figure 4), the
increase of water acidity upon adsorption is not sufficient to favor
the dissociative form.

Figure 4 Projected DOS (pDOS) associated with the Obr 2p bands and metal d bands.

The computed preference of a single water to be molecularly
adsorbed form on (110)-TiO2 is in agreement with the recent
carefully conducted molecular beam/STM experiments by Wang et al.,9 which determine that molecular adsorption is
preferred by 0.035 eV. It should be noted that whether or not water
adsorbs in a molecular or a dissociative form on a defect-free TiO2 (110) surface has been a subject of intense debate.7 From a computational point of view, different
works agree with the fact that the energy difference between mol and diss is small and sensitive to
the computational approximation.9,10,36,37

A significantly different
behavior is observed for the (011) surface. At this surface, the diss form is the most stable adsorbed species on TiO2, whereas the mol form is the preferred one
on RuO2 and IrO2. This can be related to the
different behavior observed regarding the water adsorption energies
on (110) and (011). The interaction energy of water on TiO2 (110) is smaller than on TiO2 (011), whereas for RuO2 and IrO2 the reverse trend is observed. Such differences
arise from the nature of the vacant site (axial or equatorial) on
each surface and on the octahedral distortion observed in the bulk
of each material: tetragonal elongation for TiO2 (axial
bonds are larger than equatorial ones) and tetragonal compression
for RuO2 and IrO2 (axial bonds are shorter than
equatorial ones). As mentioned above, the vacant site of M5c in the (110) surface is axial, whereas the vacant site of M5c in the (011) surface is equatorial. Thus, for TiO2, interaction of water with the axial vacant site of M5c in (110)-TiO2 is smaller than the interaction with the
equatorial vacant site of (011)-TiO2, whereas the opposite
is observed for RuO2 and IrO2. The larger the
interaction is, the larger the increase of acidity of the water molecule,
which would explain that the proton transfer to Obr occurs
more easily on (011) than on (110) for TiO2 and on (110)
than on (011) for RuO2 and IrO2. Among these
latter materials, relative energies indicate that deprotonation on
(011), although unfavorable in both cases, is less difficult on IrO2 (7.0 kJ mol–1) than on RuO2 (12.6
kJ mol–1) as found for (110).

Differences
in structural parameters and net atomic charges are consistent with
this explanation. For TiO2, M–Ow and
Obr–Hw distances are larger on the (110)
surface (2.251 and 1.794 Å) than on the (011) one (2.103 and
1.510 Å). In line with these findings, the net charge of the
water molecule when adsorbed in (110)-TiO2 is 0.069 a.u
and 0.075 in (011)-TiO2. In contrast, for RuO2, the values of these distances follow the opposite trend; that is,
M–Ow and Obr–Hw distances
on the (110)-RuO2 surface (2.172 and 1.588 Å) are
shorter than on the (011)-RuO2 one (2.177 and 1.615 Å)
and the net charge of water is 0.104 when adsorbed on (110)-RuO2 and 0.076 on (110)-RuO2. For IrO2,
we could not locate the mol form on the (110) surface.
The trends observed on the electron transfer from water to the metal
oxides are in agreement with the fact that metal d-bands above the
Fermi level are higher for TiO2 than for RuO2 and IrO2 (see Figure 4), which would explain the smaller electron donation
from water to the metal and weaker bond in the former case.

Overall, the ability of (110) and (011) surfaces to induce dissociation
of an interacting water molecule seems to be ultimately related to
(i) the kind of octahedral distortion observed in the bulk of these
materials (tetragonal elongation for TiO2 and tetragonal
compression for RuO2 and IrO2) and (ii) the
different nature of the vacant sites created (axial or equatorial)
on these surfaces.

Adsorption of Water Monolayer
Previous
section has shown that the relative stability between the mol and diss adsorbed forms of water on
the (110) and (011) surfaces of MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and Ir)
depends on the increase of water acidity upon adsorption and on the
basicity of Obr. These factors depend on the metal oxide
and on the different nature of the M5c vacant at each surface.
At higher water coverages, however, cooperative H-bond interactions
can come into play in determining whether deprotonation occurs or
not. Thus, we have analyzed the structure of a water monolayer on
each surface and metal oxide. For that, we have added one water molecule
at each of the unsaturated metal centers; that is, four molecules
per unit cell at the (110) surface and eight water molecules at the
(011) one. We considered all possible combinations of mol and diss water molecules as initial structures.
For instance, for the (110) surface, we considered seven possible
structures: (i) 4 undissociated (molecular) water molecules (4mol), (ii) 3 molecular and 1 dissociated (3mol/1diss), (iii) 2mol/2diss, (iv) 1mol/3diss, and (v) 4diss. Note that for the 2mol/2diss configuration three different starting situations are possible,
two in which the two equal molecules (mol or diss) are neighbors and another one in which they are not.
All possible combinations were also considered for the (011) surface.
Adsorption energies per water molecule and structural parameters of
main configurations are given in Table 4. Figure 5 shows the optimized structures of the most stable configuration
of each material and surface.

First of all, it
can be observed that the adsorption energy per water molecule in the
monolayer is in all cases except (110)-IrO2 and (011)-TiO2 larger (in absolute value) than that of a single water molecule,
which indicates the presence of cooperative effects as a result of
the formation of H-bond chains of moderate strength. Indeed, Figure 5 shows that two parallel
H-bond chains separated by Obr are formed for both the
(110) and (011) surfaces. Increases on the adsorption energy per water
molecule range from 10 to 30 kJ mol–1 and result
from a subtle balance between the changes induced on the water–surface
interaction, which decreases as indicated by the increase of the M–O
distance, and the stabilizing H-bond interactions between the water
molecules in the monolayer. At the (110)-IrO2 surface,
the adsorption energy per water molecule is essentially the same than
that obtained for the isolated water molecule because the H-bonding
at this surface is the weakest one; that is, the Ow1–Hw2 distance (2.350 Å) is the largest one. At the (011)-TiO2 surface, the adsorption energy is smaller in the monolayer
because there is a significant increase of the M–O distance
(see Tables 3 and 4).

Most stable monolayer configuration depends
on the material and on the surface. For (110)-TiO2, the
most stable arrangement is that in which no water molecules are dissociated
(4mol), whereas for (110)-RuO2, the preferred
configuration has a 50% degree of deprotonation (2mol/2diss) and for (110)-IrO2, the only
configuration located exhibits a 100% degree of deprotonation (4diss). This trend is in agreement with what was found for
the adsorption of a single water molecule, which showed that the preference
for dissociation increases from TiO2 to RuO2 and to IrO2. Indeed, for the latter material only the
dissociated form was localized (see Table 3). For RuO2, the 2mol/2diss situation is more stable than the 4diss, despite the dissociation of a single water molecule
being the preferred situation (Table 3), because it allows forming very stable H3O2– species. That is, this 2mol/2diss configuration encloses two H3O2– species resulting from deprotonation
of two water molecules to two Obr. This deprotonation leads
to OH– species that, due to their higher basicity,
establish strong hydrogen bonds (∼1.7 Å) with the undissociated
water molecules. Furthermore, as already seen previously for H2O–RuO2,21 the
M–OH interaction involves a significant electron donation to
the surface that accumulates on the Obr so that the charge
of the H3O2– species is smaller
than 1. For IrO2, the water–surface interaction
dominates, in agreement with its much larger interaction energy (see Table 3) and higher surface
energy (Table 2) and
all water molecules dissociate. In this situation, H-bonding between
metal-coordinated OH– is very weak, and thus, adsorption energy
per water molecule is essentially the same as that of an isolated
molecule.

For the (011) surface, we observe similar trends;
that is, the most stable arrangement (011)-TiO2 is that
in which no water molecules are dissociated (8mol), whereas for (011)-RuO2 and (011)-IrO2, the
preferred configurations exhibit a 50% (4mol/4diss) and 75% (2mol/6diss) degree of deprotonation, respectively. In this case, the observed
trends are not in agreement with that found for the adsorption of
a single water molecule, which shows that the dissociated form is
the preferred situation for TiO2 and the molecular form
the preferred one for RuO2 and IrO2. This is
due to the fact that the presence of the monolayer modifies the water–surface
interaction as compared to that with a single molecule. For TiO2, the adsorption energy per water molecule in the monolayer
is smaller than in the single water adsorption. Indeed, the Ti–O
distance is significantly larger in the former (2.24 vs 2.10 Å).
Such an increase in the M–O distance is produced to establish
an efficient H-bond network but weakens the water–surface interaction,
leading to a smaller increase of water acidity that hinders deprotonation.
Still, the configuration with 50% dissociation, that is, with two
H3O2– and two protonated Obr, is only 3 kJ mol–1 less stable than the
fully undissociated one (Table 4), and thus, the present results are not conclusive about
whether water monolayer at the (110)-TiO2 surface is dissociated
or not. Furthermore, thermal effects need to be taken into account.

For (011)-RuO2, the most stable configuration encloses
four molecular and four dissociated waters; that is, it shows a 50%
degree of deprotonation, as in the (110) surface. Note that we have
not been able to localize a minimum corresponding to the fully undissociated
monolayer. Attempts to optimize such a structure collapsed to (6mol/2diss), the second most representative
structure. This behavior is in contrast with the fact that isolated
water prefers a molecular adsorbed form. However, formation of H3O2– species, with a strong H-bond
between the OH– and the undissociated water molecule,
is particularly favorable. A 50% deprotonation is the preferred situation
as it maximizes the number of H3O2– units and hence H-bond cooperative effects.

For (011)-IrO2, the preferred configuration shows a 75% deprotonation (2mol/6diss), despite the molecular form
being the most stable for the isolated water molecule, although with
a lower relative energy as compared to RuO2. This 75% deprotonation
does not maximize the number of H3O2–, as one would expect, because water surface interaction dominates
over H-bonding. Furthermore, as already seen for RuO2,21 adsorption cooperative effects may induce deprotonation.
That is, deprotonation of one water molecule favors deprotonation
of a neighbor adsorbed water because of the increase of the metal
Lewis acidity as a result of the protonation of Obr. Overall,
the degree of deprotonation results from a subtle balance between
H-bond cooperativity and adsorption cooperativity. In the case of
IrO2, the latter effect is larger because of the larger
interaction with the metal sites.

Present results show that
relative energies corresponding to lower mol/diss configuration arrangements per water molecule are small
(3–16 kJ mol–1) and thus may contribute to
the behavior of the water–metal oxide interface. On the other
hand, thermal effects may modify the relative stability of these configurations.
Because of that, we have run AIMDs up to 8 ps (1 ps equilibration)
for all metal oxides and the two surfaces starting from the most stable
monolayer obtained with static calculations. Figure 6 shows the H-bond distances corresponding
to two interacting water molecules and those between these water molecules
and Obr along the simulation. M–O distances are
reported in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Table 5 shows the
frequency of each possible configuration, considering that proton
transfer to an Obr occurs if the H-bond distance is smaller
than 1.2 Å.

For (110)-TiO2 and (110)-RuO2, the most stable configurations (4mol and 2mol/2diss, respectively) remain along the
7–8 ps simulation. For (110)-TiO2, the Obr–Hw H-bond distance oscillates around 1.7
Å, whereas the H-bond distance between the two water molecules
oscillates around 2.1 Å. In the latter case, oscillations are
larger because of the weaker H-bond. For (110)-RuO2, H-bond
distances are consistent with the presence of H3O2– species and a protonated Obr almost
all along the simulation. Note that the frequency of the 2mol/2diss is 99.9% and only the 1mol/3diss arrangement appears in 0.1%.
For IrO2, we observed a larger proton mobility. As predicted
by static calculations, the main configuration is a fully dissociated
monolayer (4diss) with an 84% frequency. Noticeably,
there is a non-negligible frequency of the 1mol/3diss (11.4%) and of the 2mol/2diss (4.8%). This indicates that thermal effects disfavor deprotonation,
because of the increase of the M–Ow distances, which
reduces the water–surface interaction and thus the water acidity.

The (011) surface shows a larger proton mobility compared to the
(110) one. For TiO2 and RuO2, most stable configurations
(8mol and 4mol/4diss, respectively) obtained from static calculations remain the most
frequent arrangement (94 and 72%). However, for IrO2, the
most stable configuration (2mol/6diss) is no longer the main one when including thermal effects. Indeed,
three configurations account for a frequency of 95%: 4mol/4diss with 33%, 3mol/5diss with 43%, and 2mol/6diss with 19%. Note that the most frequent configuration (3mol/5diss) does not correspond to the most stable one
obtained from static calculations (2mol/6diss). These results again show that thermal effects tend
to decrease the M–OH2 interactions, thereby increasing
the percentage of molecular water.

Conclusions
The
present study analyzes the H2O–MO2 (M
= Ti, Ru, and Ir) interactions by means of periodic DFT (PBE-D2) calculations.
Adsorption of both an isolated water molecule and a full monolayer
on the two surfaces that mostly contribute to the Wulff shape, the
(110) and (011) surfaces, has been addressed. Results indicate that
the adsorption of a single molecule preferably occurs in its molecular
form on the (110)-TiO2 surface and in its dissociative
form on (110)-RuO2 and (110)-IrO2. However,
the opposite trend is observed on the (011) surface; that is, water
prefers to adsorb in its dissociative form on (011)-TiO2 and in its molecular form on (011)-RuO2 and (011)-IrO2. This is related to the kind of octahedral distortion observed
in the bulk of these materials (tetragonal elongation for TiO2 and tetragonal compression for RuO2 and IrO2) and to the different nature of the vacant sites created
on these surfaces, axial on (110) and equatorial on (011). Thus, water
adsorption on TiO2 leads to longer M–O distances
on (110) than on (011), and consequently, the increase of water acidity
(and possible dissociation) is larger on (011). The opposite is observed
for RuO2 and IrO2 with longer M–O distances
on (011). Furthermore, adsorption energies (in absolute value) increase
from TiO2 to RuO2 and IrO2, along
with the electron transfer from the water molecule to MO2.

For the monolayer, in addition to the intrinsic water adsorption,
other effects such as cooperative H-bond interactions, particularly
the formation of H3O2– species,
and cooperative adsorption come into play in determining whether deprotonation
occurs or not. Furthermore, thermal effects seem to favor configurations
with a smaller degree of dissociation because of an enlargement of
M–O distances, which leads to a smaller increase of water acidity.
For TiO2, water monolayer is fully undissociated on both
(110) and (011) surfaces, whereas for RuO2, water monolayer
exhibits a 50% dissociation, the formation of H3O2– motifs being essential. Finally, on (110)-IrO2, the main monolayer configuration is the fully dissociated
one, whereas on (011)-IrO2, it exhibits a degree of dissociation
that ranges from 50 to 75%. Overall, the present study shows that
several effects, in addition to the intrinsic water adsorption, are
responsible for the degree of dissociation of adsorbed water on MO2 (M = Ti, Ru, and Ir), IrO2 being the one more
prone to induce dissociation.

Computational Details
Periodic boundary
DFT calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP) code.54,55 All calculations were performed
with the GGA PBE functional56 plus D2 Grimme’s
correction57 for dispersion and using the
projector augmented wave pseudopotentials58,59 to describe ionic cores and valence electrons through a plane wave
basis with a kinetic energy cutoff equal to 500 eV. The above computational
parameters ensure a good agreement with experimental cell parameters
of the bulk structures for all the studied materials (TiO2, RuO2, IrO2). Moreover, the inclusion of dispersion
corrections is essential to describe properly adsorption processes60 and bulk water.61,62 Bulk calculations
were performed considering a K-point mesh for the
Brillouin zone of (8,8,8), (15,15,15), and (9,9,9) for TiO2, RuO2, and IrO2, respectively, employing the
Monkhorst–Pack (MP) grid,63 whereas
slab calculations were performed considering a MP K-point mesh of (3,3,1), (6,6,1), and (4,4,1) for TiO2,
RuO2, and IrO2, respectively. The cutoff and K-point mesh were chosen according to the best cost/accuracy
strategy of both cell parameters and surface energies. The energy
convergence criteria for electronic and geometry relaxations were
fixed to 10–5 and 10–4 eV, respectively.

Because the water adsorption mode on TiO2 has been controversial
and sensitive to the computational approach,7,10 we
have performed additional calculations for this system with a hybrid
functional PBE064 and considering the D3
correction for dispersion65 (see Table
S1 of the Supporting Information). Results
obtained at the PBE0-D2 and PBE-D3 levels of theory show that although
adsorption energies can vary up to 13 kJ mol–1 with
respect to PBE-D2, relative energies between the molecular and dissociative
forms follow the same trend and vary less than 3.5 kJ mol–1, which shows the robustness of the chosen approximation.

Surface
models of the main crystallographic orientations were built by cutting
out the slab from the optimized bulk structure. Slabs were constructed
considering a (2 × 1) supercell and a four-layer thickness, the
minimum one for a reasonable converged surface energy (see Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information). The
c value was set to 35 Å ensuring an interlayer distance of at
least 21 Å to minimize the interaction between replicas in the
(h k l) perpendicular direction. Atom positions were
fully relaxed in the optimization process. Surface energies of the
(110) and (011) facets were computed through the following equation: 1  where Eslab is the energy corresponding
to the relaxed surface without optimizing the bulk cell parameters; Ebulk is the fully relaxed bulk energy; N is the number of formula units in the slab per units in
the bulk unit cell; and 2A is the corresponding two
cross-sectional area of the slab.

Water adsorption on the two
most stable facets of the rutile polymorph, that is, (110) and (011),
was simulated with a (2 × 2) supercell in both the low and high
coverage regimes. The low coverage regime corresponds to the adsorption
of only one water molecule per unit cell, whereas in the high coverage
regime, all the outermost (undercoordinated) metal atoms were saturated
with water molecules, leading to a water monolayer. Reported adsorption
energies are normalized per water molecule, according to the following
equation: 2  where E(hkl)+H2O is the total energy
of the slab with the adsorbed water, E(hkl) is the total energy of the slab model, EH2O is the total energy of an isolated
water inside a 15 × 15 × 15 Å3 cubic box,
and n(H2O) is the number of
adsorbed waters onto the surfaces. The properties of these materials
and their propensity to induce water deprotonation are discussed in
terms of pDOS and Bader charge analysis.66−68

At this
point, it is worth mentioning that TiO2 is particularly
sensitive to the computational model used.7 Concerning the slab thickness of the (110) surface, our calculations
show, as found previously,36 an even odd
oscillation on the water adsorption energy with the number of TiO2 layers (see Table S2 of the Supporting Information). Most accurate results, given by a six- or seven-layer
TiO2 slab, provide the molecular form as the more stable
one, as found experimentally.9 Because
of computational reasons, and for consistency with RuO2 and IrO2, present calculations correspond to a four-layer
TiO2 slab. This model provides the correct relative stability
between the molecular and dissociative forms, although with a relative
energy (34.7 kJ mol–1) that is significantly higher
than that recently determined by combining supersonic molecular beam,
STM, and AIMD (3.5 kJ mol–1).9 Regarding the (011) surface, it is worth mentioning that
depending on the number of layers, the surface may present a significant
reconstruction, as observed experimentally.11 This involves the cleavage of two internal Ti–O bonds to
strengthen the Ti–O bonds with the surface undercoordinated
Ti5c sites (see Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). The energy difference between the non-reconstructed
and the reconstructed one is small (Figure S4), and the former surface has a higher surface energy.

AIMDs
were carried out on the most stable water monolayer structures (i.e.,
the one with the most stable deprotonation degree) for both (110)
and (011) surfaces for all the materials. The energy convergence criteria
were fixed to 10–4 eV. AIMDs were carried out considering
an equilibration period of 1 ps (1000 steps of 1 ft) and a production
period of 7 ps (7000 steps of 1 ft) in the NVT ensemble.
During both the equilibration and the production periods, only the
water monolayer and the first layer of the surface were allowed to
move according to the motion’s equations, while atoms of the
remaining surface layers were maintained at fixed positions. This
option was chosen in order to avoid unrealistic deformation of the
structure of the slabs and to simulate the actual rigidity of the
material.
