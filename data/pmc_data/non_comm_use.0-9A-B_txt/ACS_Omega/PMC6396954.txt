The
mycobacterial outer membrane, or mycomembrane, is essential
for the viability and virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related pathogens. The mycomembrane is a dynamic structure,
whose chemical composition and biophysical properties can change during
stress to give an advantage to the bacterium. However, the mechanisms
that govern mycomembrane remodeling and their significance to mycobacterial
pathogenesis are still not well characterized. Recent studies have
shown that trehalose dimycolate (TDM), a major glycolipid of the mycomembrane,
is broken down by the mycobacteria-specific enzyme TDM hydrolase (Tdmh)
in response to nutrient deprivation, a process which appears to modulate
the mycomembrane to increase nutrient acquisition, but at the expense
of stress tolerance. Tdmh activity thus balances the growth of M. tuberculosis during infection in a manner that
is contingent upon host immunity. Current methods to probe Tdmh activity
are limited, impeding the development of inhibitors and the investigation
of the role of Tdmh in bacterial growth and persistence. Here, we
describe the synthesis and evaluation of FRET-TDM, which is a fluorescence-quenched
analogue of TDM that is designed to fluoresce upon hydrolysis by Tdmh
and potentially other trehalose ester-degrading hydrolases involved
in mycomembrane remodeling. We found that FRET-TDM was efficiently
activated in vitro by recombinant Tdmh, generating a 100-fold increase
in fluorescence. FRET-TDM was also efficiently activated in the presence
of whole cells of Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, but the observed
signal was predominantly Tdmh-independent, suggesting that physiological
levels of Tdmh are low and that other mycobacterial enzymes also hydrolyze
the probe. The latter notion was confirmed by employing a native protein
gel-based fluorescence assay to profile FRET-TDM-activating enzymes
from M. smegmatis lysates. On the other
hand, FRET-TDM was capable of detecting the activity of Tdmh in cells
when it was overexpressed. Together, our data demonstrate that FRET-TDM
is a convenient and sensitive in vitro probe of Tdmh activity, which
will be beneficial for Tdmh enzymatic characterization and inhibitor
screening. In more complex samples, for example, live cells or cell
lysates, FRET-TDM can serve as a tool to probe Tdmh activity at elevated
enzyme levels, and it may facilitate the identification and characterization
of related hydrolases that are involved in mycomembrane remodeling.
Our study also provides insights as to how the structure of FRET-TDM
or related fluorogenic probes can be optimized to achieve improved
specificity and sensitivity for detecting mycobacteria.

==== Body
Introduction
The
mycomembrane is a glycolipid-rich outer membrane that is recognized
as the defining ultrastructural feature of mycobacteria and related
species in the Corynebacterineae suborder.1,2 These
bacteria, which include the devastating intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),3 rely on the mycomembrane to permit
entry of nutrients into the cell while also providing defense from
environmental assaults, such as the host immune response and antibiotic
treatment.4−8 Understanding how mycobacteria modulate their
mycomembrane to balance nutrient acquisition, stress tolerance, and
immunoactivity will provide insight into how these pathogens thrive
in the host at different stages of infection, potentially informing
the development of new strategies for tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment.

The mycomembrane is composed of structurally heterogeneous lipid
entities including glycolipids, among which sugar esters of branched
mycolic acids (C30–C100, depending on
the species) are predominant (schematic shown in Figure 1A).9 The inner leaflet of the mycomembrane is composed of mycolic acids
that are ester-linked to arabinofuranosyl units of the underlying
arabinogalactan (AG) layer, which in turn is covalently linked to
the peptidoglycan layer.10 The outer leaflet
of the mycomembrane is thought to be composed of noncovalently associated
lipids and glycolipids, including trehalose dimycolate (TDM), which
has mycolic acids esterified to both 6-positions of the disaccharide
trehalose (Figure 1B).10 TDM is an abundant mycobacterial
glycolipid, and it has an intriguing dual biological role: it is a
major component of the cell envelope that confers structural integrity
and stress tolerance to the bacterium, while also serving as a potent
immunostimulant that drives key aspects of the host immune response
to Mtb infection, including granuloma
formation.11−16

of TDM. TDM is synthesized by Ag85-mediated transfer of a mycoloyl
group from one molecule of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) to another.
Ag85 also synthesizes AGM using TMM as a mycoloyl donor and AG as
an acceptor. TDM is degraded by Tdmh-catalyzed hydrolysis to produce
free mycolic acid and TMM (shown) and/or trehalose.

Mounting evidence suggests that, to provide an
advantage in certain
environments, mycobacteria remodel their mycomembrane by adjusting
TDM levels. Known TDM biosynthesis and degradation pathways are depicted
in Figure 1B. TDM is
biosynthesized by the antigen 85 (Ag85) complex, which consists of
several mycoloyltransferase isoforms that catalyze the transfer of
mycoloyl groups from TMM to acceptor molecules, including a reaction
in which two TMM molecules combine to generate one molecule each of
TDM and trehalose.17−19 While the only established role of Ag85 mycoloyltransferases
in vivo is in the synthesis of TDM and AG-linked mycolate (AGM), Ag85-catalyzed
breakdown of TDM, via both acyltransferase and acylhydrolase activity,
has been observed in assays utilizing purified Ag85 enzyme.20 Ojha and co-workers recently discovered a dedicated
TDM-specific hydrolase (Tdmh), which degrades TDM to release free
mycolic acid.21−23 Studies using Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg) and Mtb mutants lacking Tdmh have provided insights into how TDM levels
are regulated to alter mycobacterial physiology and pathogenesis.
In nonpathogenic Msmeg, Tdmh releases
free mycolic acid from TDM during the formation of drug-tolerant biofilms,
and the genetic removal of Tdmh retards Msmeg biofilm formation.21 In pathogenic Mtb, Tdmh is induced during nutrient deprivation
and degrades TDM to increase permeability of the cell envelope toward
nutrients, while concomitantly lowering the bacterium’s defenses
and sensitizing it to stress (Figure 1A).23 It is proposed that
this adaptive response mechanism may allow Mtb to advantageously balance its growth in nutrient-limiting intracellular
environments (i.e., within macrophages) in a manner that is contingent
on host innate immunity.23

Given
the nongenetically encoded nature of carbohydrates, lipids,
and their conjugates, there is considerable experimental difficulty
associated with investigating mycomembrane remodeling and its contributions
to the complex and dynamic host–pathogen interactions that
underlie Mtb infection. To date, such
studies have mainly been restricted to the use of mutant strains along
with radiolabeling and cellular fractionation techniques, a combined
approach that has various experimental and practical limitations.
In the past few years, the development of chemical probes has enabled
tagging and analysis of various mycomembrane components in living
mycobacterial cells.24,25 Fluorescent, clickable, and radiolabeled
trehalose analogues have been developed by various labs, including
ours, and have permitted metabolic labeling of TMM and TDM.26−32 We also recently developed TMM analogues that exploit Ag85 activity
to label TDM, AGM, or proteins that are post-translationally modified
with mycolates.33−44 The Kiessling group recently expanded upon the TMM
probe concept with a FRET-based fluorogenic TMM analogue (QTF), which
generated fluorescence upon Ag85-mediated separation of its trehalose-linked
quencher and lipid-linked fluorophore.35 QTF was used to perform real-time fluorescence imaging of Ag85 activity
during mycobacterial growth and division, which highlighted the complementarity
of fluorogenic probes that report directly on enzyme activity as opposed
to metabolically tagging the products of enzymatic reactions.35 While significant effort has been put forth
to develop probes of Ag85-catalyzed reactions and their cellular products,
to date there is a lack of probes that are designed to report on TDM
breakdown, which, as described above, is a critical stress-responsive
mycomembrane remodeling mechanism that may be conserved across mycobacteria.
Here, we describe the development of FRET-TDM, which is a synthetic
fluorescence-quenched TDM analogue that fluoresces upon hydrolysis
by Tdmh and potentially other mycomembrane-remodeling enzymes. Our
studies demonstrate the utility and limitations of this fluorogenic
probe in various assays, as well as offer insights for future optimization
of probe structure and applications in mycobacteriology.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic FRET-TDM Is a
Fluorescence-Quenched TDM Analogue
As a first-generation
fluorogenic probe for detecting TDM breakdown,
we designed FRET-TDM (1), which consists of a TDM-mimicking
core bearing two linear 10-carbon acyl chains functionalized at their
termini with fluorescein as the fluorophore and dabcyl as the quencher
(Scheme 1). In a fully
extended conformation, FRET-TDM’s fluorophore and quencher
are separated by a maximum of ∼40 Å, so we expected that
these moieties were far enough away from the TDM core to allow recognition
and processing by TDM-degrading hydrolases, but close enough together
in the esterified state to provide efficient fluorescence quenching.
Although native TDM possesses α-branched, β-hydroxyl mycolate
groups (Figure 1B),
we chose to install more synthetically tractable linear chains, which
our prior work on TMM-based probes showed can still be tolerated by
mycoloyl ester-processing enzymes.33−44 The synthesis of FRET-TDM
(Scheme 1C) was initiated
by diacylation of diol 2(36) with 10-azidodecanoic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), followed by acid-mediated
desilylation and Pd-catalyzed azide reduction to give symmetrical
diamine 3 in 96% yield over three steps. Diamine 3 was desymmetrized via reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC), giving intermediate 4 in 30% yield, with the
other major reaction components being unreacted 3 and
the doubly FITC-modified molecule. Compound 4 was subsequently
reacted with the activated NHS ester of dabcyl to deliver FRET-TDM
in 81% yield following purification on a preparative C18 column. This
synthetic strategy is modular, as diamine 3 can be sequentially
reacted with any pair of amine-reactive fluorophore and quencher to
obtain different FRET probes.

Next, we evaluated the quenching efficiency of FRET-TDM. For comparison,
we synthesized one of the possible esterase-cleaved fluorescent byproducts
of FRET-TDM, a fluorescein-modified TMM derivative (FITC-TMM, Scheme S1). Evaluation of concentration-dependent
fluorescence of FRET-TDM and FITC-TMM in the concentration range used
for biological experiments demonstrated that FRET-TDM had a quenching
efficiency of 98.7% (Figure 2A). Thus, in its intact form, FRET-TDM was confirmed to be
in an “off” state, which, upon enzymatic separation
of the fluorophore and quencher, would be converted to a brightly
fluorescent “on” state. FRET-TDM also exhibited good
hydrolytic stability in various buffers and media in the absence of
enzyme (Figure S1). It is notable that,
in its quenched state, FRET-TDM exhibited variable background fluorescence
in different types of buffers and media (Figure S1), underscoring the importance of using the same matrix for
comparison of FRET-TDM activation between samples.

FRET-TDM Is Activated by Purified Mycomembrane-Remodeling Enzymes
As Tdmh and Ag85 are, in principle, both capable of breaking down
mycoloyl trehalose linkages, we tested recombinant Tdmh from M. smegmatis and a representative Ag85 isoform, Ag85C
from Mtb, for hydrolytic cleavage of
FRET-TDM. Following optimization of probe and enzyme concentrations
(Figure S2), reactions were performed with
FRET-TDM (10 μM) in the presence of 10 μg/mL of purified
Tdmh, Ag85C, or their corresponding inactive catalytic serine mutants
TdmhS124A and Ag85CS124A (or in buffer without
enzyme). Fluorescence was monitored continuously using a plate reader
(excitation/emission 485/535 nm) over 16 h. Both Tdmh and Ag85C showed
time-dependent activation of the probe, with Tdmh showing faster probe
turn-on than Ag85C; the catalytic mutants and buffer control showed
virtually no increase in fluorescence over 16 h (Figure 2B). For both Tdmh and Ag85C,
a maximum fluorescence value was reached, which then gradually dropped,
possibly due to the relatively low photostability of fluorescein.
At the 90 min time point, Tdmh and Ag85C treatment led to approximately
100- and 25-fold fluorescence turn-on, respectively (Figure 2C). Consistent with these results,
Michaelis–Menten kinetic analysis of FRET-TDM hydrolysis by
Tdmh revealed Km and kcat/Km values of 1.99 ±
0.42 (μM) and 0.22 ± 0.05 (min–1 μM–1), respectively, whereas for Ag85C these parameters
were 0.71 ± 0.07 (μM) and 0.10 ± 0.01 (min–1 μM–1) (Figure 2D,E). These data indicate that while Ag85C
binds slightly more tightly to FRET-TDM, Tdmh catalyzes its hydrolysis
more rapidly and is generally more efficient at activating the probe,
as anticipated. The ability to capitalize on FRET-TDM’s fluorogenic
design to define the kinetic parameters of hydrolase-catalyzed probe
activation will facilitate future structural optimization efforts
aimed at enhancing probe specificity for mycobacterial enzymes.

Next, we used mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the reaction
products of Tdmh-catalyzed FRET-TDM breakdown. Previous work established
that Tdmh catalyzes the release of free mycolic acid from TDM,21 but to date it has not been determined whether
the reaction products are TMM and one mycolic acid (as shown in Figure 1B) or trehalose and
two mycolic acids. FRET-TDM was incubated in the presence or absence
of Tdmh for 24 h, and then the reaction mixtures were analyzed by
ESI-MS. In the no-enzyme control sample, only unreacted FRET-TDM was
observed, whereas in the sample exposed to Tdmh, peaks were observed
for unreacted FRET-TDM and the four possible products of single-chain
cleavage, including FITC- and dabcyl-modified TMM and 10-carbon fatty
acid derivatives (Figure 3). These results confirmed that Tdmh indeed degrades FRET-TDM
by hydrolyzing the 6-position ester bonds. No obvious preference of
the enzyme for hydrolyzing the FITC- or dabcyl-modified acyl chain
was observed, which is not surprising given that these modifications
are distant from the reaction site. Furthermore, free trehalose was
not observed in the Tdmh-treated sample by ESI-MS. Assuming comparable
detection efficiency for the relevant product ions, this result suggests
that Tdmh produces TMM and one mycolic acid but does not further degrade
TMM to trehalose, supporting the model shown in Figure 1B. Taken together, the in vitro fluorescence
and MS evaluation data demonstrate that FRET-TDM is a fluorescence-quenched
TDM analogue which can be used to monitor the hydrolytic activity
of purified TDM-degrading hydrolases involved in mycomembrane remodeling,
including Tdmh.

FRET-TDM Is Activated by
Live Mycobacterial Cells
Having
confirmed that FRET-TDM can be turned on by purified Tdmh, we proceeded
to test whether the probe was activated by whole mycobacterial cells
(see Table S1 for mycobacterial strains
used in this study). First, we evaluated the kinetics of FRET-TDM
activation by live Msmeg strains growing
logarithmically, as assessed by continuous fluorescence monitoring
during an overnight culture experiment (Figure 4A). Wild-type Msmeg mc2155 elicited rapid fluorescence turn-on and the signal
plateaued at approximately 6 h with a >100-fold increase in fluorescence
relative to the initial time point. To assess the contribution of
Tdmh to the observed fluorescence signal, we evaluated FRET-TDM activation
in a strain devoid of Tdmh (ΔMSMEG_1529) and
in a complemented strain that overexpresses Tdmh under the control
of the hsp60 promoter (ΔMSMEG_1529comp).21 The fluorescence values for ΔMSMEG_1529 tracked very closely with those from wild-type Msmeg, with perhaps slightly slower probe activation. Thus, although wild-type Msmeg triggers efficient turn-on of FRET-TDM, it
occurs in a predominantly (if not completely) Tdmh-independent manner.
This suggests that, under the conditions tested, physiological levels
of Tdmh in Msmeg are too low to be
detected by FRET-TDM, and thus other more abundant mycobacterial hydrolases
may be responsible for the cumulative signal from probe cleavage.
On the other hand, the Tdmh-overexpressing strain, ΔMSMEG_1529comp, activated FRET-TDM more rapidly than wild-type Msmeg and clearly resulted in higher overall fluorescence
intensities, indicating that the probe is capable of reporting on
Tdmh activity in cells if the enzyme is sufficiently abundant.

Probe activation by attenuated Mtb (mc27000), Tdmh-deficient Mtb (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb), and its complement (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:p5152). (C) Probe
activation by a Tdmh-deficient Mtb strain
expressing Msmeg Tdmh under the control
of an acetamide-inducible promoter (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pAO10) and its corresponding empty plasmid control strain (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pLAM12), both in the presence of acetamide. For (A), Msmeg strains were cultured in the presence of FRET-TDM
(10 μM) and fluorescence was monitored continuously in a plate
reader over 15 h. For (B,C), Mtb strains
were cultured in the presence of FRET-TDM (10 μM) over 24 h
and fluorescence was analyzed at the time points indicated. Mean values
from three replicate experiments are shown for (A–C) and error
bars in (B,C) represent the standard deviation. All experiments were
performed alongside a probe-only control consisting of FRET-TDM (10
μM) in the appropriate medium. See Table S1 for strain descriptions and references.

Next, we evaluated FRET-TDM activation in Mtb mc27000, which is an attenuated strain
of Mtb.37 As with Msmeg, Mtb mc27000 showed time-dependent FRET-TDM turn-on, registering
an
8-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity after 24 h compared to
the initial time point (Figure 4B). The lower efficiency of probe activation in Mtb versus Msmeg is
likely due to the former’s exceptionally slow growth rate,
but could also be affected by factors such as lower permeability of
the probe. No changes in fluorescence were observed in an Mtb mc27000 mutant lacking Tdmh (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb) or its complement (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:p5152),23 demonstrating that the signal detected in the
parent strain was produced in a Tdmh-independent manner, which is
consistent with the results from Msmeg (Figure 4A). As with Msmeg, we also evaluated whether overexpression of
Tdmh could trigger FRET-TDM activation in Mtb by testing probe turn-on in a modified strain of mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb expressing Msmeg Tdmh under the control of an acetamide-inducible
system (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pAO10) compared to its corresponding
empty vector control (mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pLAM12).23 FRET-TDM was indeed activated by Tdmh-overexpressing
mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pAO10 more efficiently than under control
conditions (Figure 4C). This result, which is consistent with the data from Msmeg, suggests that FRET-TDM is capable of reporting
on Tdmh activity in live Mtb cells
if the enzyme activity is induced.

Our results in Msmeg and Mtb suggest
that basal levels of Tdmh are too low
to be detected by FRET-TDM, but that the probe may detect Tdmh when
its expression is elevated (e.g., through genetic overexpression,
as shown above). Because Tdmh-mediated mycomembrane remodeling is
reportedly induced under nutrient-limiting conditions,21,23 we hypothesized that cell starvation would induce Tdmh expression,
leading to Tdmh-dependent FRET-TDM activation. To test this hypothesis, Msmeg or Mtb strains
were incubated in either nutrient-rich medium or starvation conditions
(PBS) and FRET-TDM activation was assessed. Regardless of whether
FRET-TDM was added to cells at the onset of PBS starvation or after
a period of up to 4 days of starvation, we did not observe Tdmh-dependent
probe turn-on in Msmeg or Mtb (Figures S3 and S4). The efficiency of FRET-TDM activation was
also significantly lower in starved cells. Thus, at least under the
culture conditions tested and the assay used here, FRET-TDM did not
report on physiologically relevant Tdmh activity in whole mycobacterial
cells. This result is probably due to the low abundance of Tdmh in
cells, which has been noted in earlier reports. Prior work showed
that when recombinant Tdmh was exogenously added to cells, TDM was
degraded to the point of cell lysis, implying that mycobacteria must
tightly regulate the concentration of active Tdmh to avoid autolysis
while also allowing for beneficial mycomembrane remodeling to occur.22 Consistent with this explanation and with our
data, Yang et al. previously reported that physiological levels of
Tdmh could not be directly detected by western blot using an anti-Tdmh
antibody, supporting the conclusion that Tdmh is a low-abundance enzyme.23 Overall, while FRET-TDM is an excellent fluorogenic
reporter of Tdmh activity in vitro and it is capable of reporting
on Tdmh activity in vivo, the probe may have a limited capacity at
its current level of sensitivity to monitor mycomembrane remodeling
mediated by low-abundance levels of Tdmh in live cells.

Native PAGE
Fluorescence Assay Reveals Multiple FRET-TDM-Activating
Enzymes in Mycobacteria
We were intrigued that FRET-TDM was
activated by Msmeg and Mtb cells in a Tdmh-independent manner, which implied
that other enzymes were cleaving the probe and thus may be candidate
mycomembrane-remodeling enzymes. To test this possibility, we established
a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)-based hydrolase
profiling assay that capitalized on the fluorogenic design of FRET-TDM.
This assay, which was inspired by prior work deploying other fluorogenic
esterase probes in mycobacteria,38,39 involved the
separation of protein samples (either purified proteins or cell lysates)
on a native polyacrylamide gel to retain their activity, then bathing
the gel in FRET-TDM and performing in-gel fluorescence scanning to
detect FRET-TDM-degrading enzymes. To verify the assay, we first evaluated
purified Tdmh and its active site mutant TdmhS124A. In
agreement with the data shown in Figure 2B,C, wild-type Tdmh generated a strong fluorescence
band, whereas the mutant enzyme did not produce fluorescence (Figure 5A). Next, we tested
whether the assay could specifically detect Tdmh activity in more
complex cell lysate samples. Escherichia coli strains21,22 engineered to produce either wild-type Tdmh
or its catalytic mutant TdmhS124A were induced to express
these proteins by treatment with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG), or left unexposed to IPTG as controls, then lysates were collected.
Analysis of the E. coli cell lysates
using the FRET-TDM native gel assay showed a major fluorescence band
corresponding to Tdmh in the IPTG-treated sample and a minor Tdmh
band in the IPTG-untreated control, the latter likely due to leaky
expression (Figure 5B). For the TdmhS124A mutant samples, no fluorescence
signal was detected in the Tdmh migration area. The specificity of
FRET-TDM for Tdmh activity in an E. coli lysate background was exceptional, as only a single faint band was
observed that appeared to be a non-Tdmh protein endogenous to E. coli (band marked with an asterisk in Figure 5B). These experiments
showed that FRET-TDM can be coupled with native PAGE to detect TDM-hydrolyzing
enzymes in complex cell lysates.

by native PAGE in parallel gels, one of which was Coomassie-stained

for fluorescence (right). (A) Analysis of purified Tdmh and TdmhS124A (1.5 μg loaded into each lane). (B) Analysis of
lysates from induced (+IPTG) or uninduced (−IPTG) Tdmh- or

in all Msmeg lysates.

Next, we applied the native gel fluorescence assay
to profile FRET-TDM-activating
proteins in cell lysates obtained from Msmeg strains, including the aforementioned Tdmh mutant (ΔMSMEG_1529) and overexpression (ΔMSMEG_1529comp) strains (Figure 5C). The wild-type Msmeg sample (lane
1) showed several fluorescent bands (marked as bands 1–7),
including one dominant band (marked as band 4), but none appearing
to co-migrate with a purified standard of Tdmh (lane 4). The mutant
banding pattern (lane 2) was identical to the wild type, whereas the
Tdmh-overexpressing strain ΔMSMEG_1529comp (lane
3) clearly revealed a new band co-migrating with Tdmh (marked with
an arrow). Lysates from Msmeg starved
in PBS did not exhibit a detectable Tdmh band (data not shown). Together,
these results mirrored our observations from the cell assays, namely
that: (i) FRET-TDM can detect Tdmh activity if the protein level is
sufficient; and (ii) other mycobacterial enzymes with hydrolase activity
likely have significant contribution to probe activation. A likely
candidate is Ag85C or other Ag85 isoforms, which are abundant in mycobacteria
and therefore may produce a strong signal despite weaker activity
relative to Tdmh (Figure 2). The identities of the unknown bands observed in the mycobacterial
lysates (Figure 5C,
lane 1) are of high interest, as they could possibly include novel
hydrolases involved in mycomembrane remodeling. FRET-TDM coupled with
native PAGE can potentially be used as a tool to facilitate the identification
and characterization of these types of enzymes. Future work in this
area will focus on combining FRET-TDM assays with MS, genetic, and
biochemical techniques to elucidate the identities and functions of
these candidate mycomembrane-remodeling enzymes.

FRET-TDM Exhibits
Partial Selectivity for Mycobacterial Hydrolases
Fluorogenic
probes that target mycobacteria-specific pathways could
eventually aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and related diseases
by improving the detection of pathogenic mycobacteria (e.g., Mtb) in patient samples.30,40 Fluorescence-quenched TDM analogues are a new entry into this probe
category, so we sought to evaluate their selectivity for mycobacterial
enzymes. The low background fluorescence of FRET-TDM in E. coli lysates was a preliminary indication of its
selectivity (Figure 5B). To further investigate FRET-TDM’s selectivity, we tested
its activation by purified Tdmh, Ag85C, and a panel of commercially
available hydrolases, which included several prokaryotic and eukaryotic
esterases and lipases (all tested at 10 μg/mL enzyme concentration).
The relative efficiency of probe turn-on by Tdmh and Ag85C was the
same as our prior experiments (Figure 2B,C), while mixed results were obtained from the other
enzymes (Figure 6A;
see Figure S5 for fluorescence intensities
plotted vs time). While hydrolases from yeast, porcine, and Pseudomonas cepacia showed virtually no increase
in fluorescence versus the probe-only control, Bacillus
subtilis esterase and Candida rugosa lipase activated FRET-TDM with approximately the same efficiency
as Tdmh. Next, we tested the selectivity of FRET-TDM activation by
whole cells of different bacterial types, including Msmeg and the related organism Corynebacterium
glutamicum, which also has a mycomembrane-like outer
membrane that is rich in TDM,41 as well
as E. coli and B. subtilis, which are representative Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,
respectively. Logarithmically growing cells of each species were washed,
normalized to the same density, re-suspended in PBS with FRET-TDM,
and incubated at 37 °C while monitoring fluorescence over approximately
14 h. All four types of bacteria activated the probe, with B. subtilis and C. glutamicum giving the highest fluorescence, followed by Msmeg and then E. coli (Figure 6B; see Figure S6 for fluorescence intensities plotted vs time).

activation by panels of hydrolases and bacteria. FRET-TDM
(10 μM) was incubated in the presence of (A) 10 μg/mL
of hydrolases from various sources or (B) different types of bacteria.
Mean values from three replicate experiments are shown and error bars

activation.

Taken together, these
results show that although FRET-TDM is activated
by mycobacterial Tdmh and Ag85, which act on trehalose mycoloyl esters,
some non-mycobacterial hydrolases and cell types also turn on the
probe. Thus, the probe design, which is based on a trehalose diester
scaffold that occurs almost exclusively in the Corynebacterineae suborder,
does confer a measure of mycobacterial selectivity to FRET-TDM, but
only partially so. Perhaps replacing the naturally occurring α-branched,
β-hydroxylated mycolate groups of TDM with more synthetically
accessible linear chains rendered FRET-TDM’s ester linkages
susceptible to cleavage by a broader range of hydrolases. Native mycolates
feature an unusual amount of steric bulk and a secondary hydroxyl
group near the ester bond (see Figure 1B), which, if present in FRET-TDM, may deter much of
the observed nonspecific probe activation. For instance, recent work
by Goins et al. suggested that the β-hydroxyl group of mycolates
plays an important role in Ag85 catalysis.42 Thus, the first-generation FRET-TDM probe reported here needs to
be optimized to improve: (i) its specificity for TDM-related metabolic
pathways and (ii) its ability to discriminate mycobacteria from other
cell types. Optimization of the FRET-TDM structure should initially
focus on the inclusion of acyl chains that more closely resemble native
mycolates. Previously reported trehalose ester-based probes—including
our clickable TMM analogues33−44 and the Kiessling group’s
FRET-based TMM probe QTF35—also
contain simplified linear acyl chains, which may present comparable
specificity challenges that could be similarly addressed for improved
mycobacterial detection. In the meantime, the limited specificity
of FRET-TDM can be exploited to identify and facilitate the characterization
of novel enzymes, which may also be involved in mycomembrane remodeling,
as noted above.

Conclusions
In summary, we chemically
synthesized and performed in vitro and
in vivo evaluation of FRET-TDM, which is a fluorescence-quenched analogue
of the virulence-associated mycomembrane glycolipid TDM. In designing
the probe, we exploited the FRET phenomenon by placing the large fluorophore
and quencher groups at the ends of the linear mycolate-mimicking acyl
chains—putting them in close enough proximity to each other
to allow for efficient fluorescence quenching while still being distal
from the ester linkages, so as not to interfere with enzymatic cleavage.
The success of this design was borne out by in vitro evaluation experiments,
which demonstrated that FRET-TDM, while non-fluorescent in the absence
of enzyme, was efficiently activated by the mycobacteria-specific
enzyme Tdmh, which is a TDM hydrolase known to be involved in stress-induced
mycomembrane remodeling. FRET-TDM was also efficiently activated in
the presence of whole cells of Msmeg and the global pathogen Mtb. The
fact that the prevailing mechanism of probe turn-on in vivo was Tdmh-independent
is consistent with the low physiological levels of this enzyme in
mycobacteria. This Tdmh-independent behavior of FRET-TDM in cells
led us to develop a native gel fluorescence assay to allow profiling
of FRET-TDM-activating enzymes in whole-cell lysates. Several such
proteins were detected in Msmeg lysates,
revealing a number of candidate hydrolases to be further characterized
in future studies. It is expected that this native gel assay, which
enlists FRET-TDM as a key tool, will be valuable for elucidating mycomembrane-remodeling
processes in mycobacteria and other members of the Corynebacterineae
suborder. Although FRET-TDM was designed to target a mycobacteria-specific
pathway, our data suggest that—in its current form—the
probe has only partial selectivity for mycobacterial enzymes and cells.
Structural optimization efforts emphasizing the inclusion of more-native
acyl chains and improved FRET pairs into next-generation FRET-TDM
(and related FRET probes) are currently underway in our lab. Building
on our prior work, this study further underscores that trehalose ester-based
probes, which target mycobacterial pathways that are distinct from
those targeted by trehalose-based probes, are emerging as a complementary
class of tools for studying and targeting mycobacteria. The latest
additions to the trehalose- and trehalose ester-based probe toolbox
include a solvatochromic trehalose probe (DMNTre) by the Bertozzi
group,30 a FRET-based TMM probe (QTF) by
the Kiessling group,35 and the FRET-based
TDM probe (FRET-TDM) described herein. Together, these recent studies
represent a shift toward probe molecules that feature no-wash, real-time
fluorescence turn-on resulting from mycobacteria-specific metabolic
events. Given the value of such probes for investigating cell envelope
metabolism and their potential to aid in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis
or other mycobacterial diseases, continued research to improve and
expand upon these molecules is of interest.

General
Methods for Synthesis
Materials and reagents
were obtained from commercial sources without further purification
unless otherwise noted. Anhydrous solvents were obtained either commercially
or from an alumina column solvent purification system. All reactions
were carried out in oven-dried glassware under inert gas unless otherwise
noted. Analytical thin-film chromatography (TLC) was performed on
glass-backed silica gel 60 Å plates (thickness 250 μm)
and detected by charring with 5% H2SO4 in EtOH.
Column chromatography was performed using flash-grade silica gel 32–63
μm (230–400 mesh). 1H NMR spectra were recorded
at 500 MHz with chemical shifts in ppm (δ) referenced to solvent
peaks. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 125 MHz. NMR spectra
were obtained on a Varian Inova 500 instrument. Coupling constants
(J) are reported in hertz (Hz). High-resolution electrospray
ionization (HR ESI) mass spectra were obtained using a Waters LCT
Premier XE using either raffinose or reserpine as the lock mass.

acid (1.900 g, 8.908 mmol), followed by slow, dropwise addition of
a freshly prepared solution of 2,3,4,2′,3′,4′-hexakis-O-(trimethylsilyl)-α,α-trehalose36 (2, 1.00 g, 1.29 mmol) in anhydrous
CH2Cl2 (15 mL). After 24 h, TLC (hexanes/ethyl
acetate 5:1) showed generation of the diester product (Rf = 0.65). The reaction was quenched by addition of excess
CH3OH and concentrated by rotary evaporation. After resuspension

product was concentrated by rotary evaporation and purified by silica
gel chromatography (hexanes/ethyl acetate 8:1 containing 1% Et3N) to give the diester intermediate. The intermediate was
dissolved in anhydrous CH3OH (80 mL) and placed under a
nitrogen atmosphere. Dowex 50WX8-400 H+ ion-exchange resin
was added and the reaction was stirred for 1 h at room temperature,
after which TLC (CH2Cl2/CH3OH 5:1)

FRET-TDM
General Storage and Use
Synthetic FRET-TDM
and FITC-TMM were typically stored as a 1 mM stock solution in DMSO
at −20 °C. Enzymatic and cellular assays utilized FRET-TDM
at final concentrations of 1–10 μM, with the final concentration
of DMSO being 1% in all samples and controls.

Commercial and Recombinant
Proteins
Msmeg Tdmh and its
catalytic mutant TdmhS124A carrying His6 tags
were expressed and purified from E. coli as previously reported by Ojha.21,22Mtb Ag85C and its catalytic mutant
Ag85CS124A carrying His6 tags were expressed
and purified from E. coli as previously
reported by Ronning.42 Purity of recombinant
proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Commercially available hydrolases
from yeast, P. cepacia, B. subtilis esterase, and C. rugosa were obtained from Sigma. Porcine pancreas lipase was obtained from
MP Biomedicals. Enzymatic activation of FRET-TDM was typically performed
using 10 μg/mL of enzyme in HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM
NaCl, pH 7) or Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% glycerol,
pH 7.4).

In Vitro Evaluation of FRET-TDM with Tdmh, Ag85C, and Commercial
Hydrolases
FRET-TDM quenching efficiency, activation by purified
enzymes, and Tdmh/Ag85C kinetics were evaluated by fluorescence assays
using a Tecan F200 or M200 multimodal plate reader. Excitation and
emission wavelengths of 488 and 525 or 535 nm were used, respectively.
Fluorescence measurements were performed in black 96-well plates.
The gain setting was optimized to wells containing the fluorescent
standard FITC-TMM. Fluorescence was monitored continuously and mean
fluorescence intensities are reported in arbitrary units (a.u.).

For the quenching efficiency experiments, varying concentrations
of FRET-TDM (0.1–10 μM) and the fluorescent standard
FITC-TMM were prepared in Tris buffer with a final DMSO concentration
of 1% in a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence measurements were taken
as described above and fluorescence versus probe concentration plots
were used to calculate quenching efficiency as described previously.43

For evaluation of FRET-TDM activation
by commercial and recombinant
enzymes (acquired as described above), 10 μg/mL of enzyme was
incubated in the presence of FRET-TDM (10 μM) in Tris buffer
at 37 °C in black 96-well plates. The final concentration of
DMSO was 1%. Reactions were initiated by addition of the enzyme to
a mixture of buffer and FRET-TDM. After thorough mixing, fluorescence
was monitored continuously as described above, typically over 12–16
h.

For determination of kinetic parameters, recombinant Msmeg Tdmh or Mtb Ag85C
(each used at 500 nM) was incubated in the presence of varying concentrations
of FRET-TDM (0.01–50 μM) in HEPES buffer at 37 °C
in black 96-well plates. The final concentration of DMSO was 1%. Reactions
were initiated by addition of the enzyme to a mixture of buffer and
FRET-TDM. After thorough mixing, fluorescence was monitored continuously
as described above over 5 min, during which the fluorescence signal
increase was linear. Relative fluorescence units were converted to
FITC-TMM concentration values using a standard curve constructed from
a dilution series of the fluorescent standard FITC-TMM measured in
the same microplate. Product concentration versus time plots were
constructed and initial velocities at each tested probe concentration
were determined. From these data, GraphPad Prism v. 6.02 was used
to obtain Michaelis–Menten plots and kinetic parameters.

For MS analysis of FRET-TDM hydrolysis by Tdmh, FRET-TDM (670 μM)
was incubated in the presence or absence of Tdmh (10 μg/mL)
in Tris buffer at 37 °C for 24 h. The sample and control were
treated with an equal volume of cold acetone and then centrifuged
at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were diluted 10-fold with
CH3CN/H2O 1:1 (v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid
and analyzed by ESI-MS in positive mode using a Waters LCT Premier
XE mass spectrometer.

Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and
FRET-TDM Cellular
Assays
See Table S1 for mycobacterial
strains used in this study. Msmeg mc2155 strains were cultured in M63 medium (0.5% casamino acids,
2% glucose, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.7 mM CaCl2) with 0.05%
Tween-80 or Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium supplemented with albumin-dextrose-catalase
(ADC), 0.5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween-80. For attenuated Mtb mc27000 strains, ADC was replaced
with OADC (contains oleic acid), and 100 μg/mL pantothenic acid
was added in 7H9 broth or plate cultures. When necessary, hygromycin
and kanamycin were added at 50–150 or 20 μg/mL to culture
mutants and the complemented strains, respectively. Other bacterial
strains used included C. glutamicum 534, E. coli K12 MG1655, and B. subtilis 168. Msmeg wild type stocks were from the Swarts lab. C. glutamicum, E. coli, and B. subtilis stocks were from the Siegrist lab (University of Massachusetts,
Amherst). C. glutamicum, E. coli, and B. subtilis were cultured in LB liquid medium.

For FRET-TDM experiments
in Msmeg mc2155, ΔMSMEG_1529, and its complementary strain ΔMSMEG_1529comp, bacteria from a freshly streaked plate were
inoculated in 7H9 with ADC or M63 medium, with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80
present in both conditions. After reaching exponential phase, cultures
were harvested and washed with PBS 1× containing 0.5% bovine
serum albumin (PBSB). Cells were resuspended in fresh medium (7H9
with ADC or M63) and normalized to OD600 = 1.0. 198 μL
of cultures were mixed with 2 μL probe (giving a final probe
concentration of 10 μM and a final DMSO concentration of 1%)
in black 96-well plates and fluorescence was continuously monitored
at 37 °C (excitation 488/emission 535) using a Tecan F200 or
M200 multimodal plate reader. For assays with starved cultures, exponential
phase cultures grown in M63 with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80 were harvested
and washed once with PBS and then starved in PBS for the desired time
before the assay process was initiated.

For FRET-TDM experiments
in Mtb mc27000 (a severely
attenuated derivative of H37Rv lacking panCD and RD1 loci) and its associated
strains, bacteria were inoculated in Sauton’s medium with 0.05%
(v/v) Tween-80 and 100 μg/mL pantothenic acid. Exponential phase
cultures were harvested and washed once with PBS 1× containing
0.05% Tween-80 (PBST). Cells were resuspended in fresh Sauton’s
medium with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80 and 100 μg/mL pantothenic acid
and normalized to OD600 = 1.0. 198 μL of cultures
were mixed with 2 μL probe (giving a final probe concentration
of 10 μM and a final DMSO concentration of 1%) in black 96-well
tissue culture-treated plates (Falcon #353219) and fluorescence reads
were collected using a BioTek Ultra microplate reader FLx800 with
excitation 485 nm and emission 540 nm. For assays involving induction
of TdmhMsmeg in mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb, 0.2% succinate and
0.2% acetamide were added to exponential phase cultures of mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pAO10 or its corresponding empty vector control
strain mc27000:ΔtdmhMtb:pLAM12 to induce TdmhMsmeg expression for 4 days before the assay process
was initiated. For assays with starved cultures, exponential phase
cultures grown in 7H9 with OADC were harvested and washed once with
PBST, then starved in PBST for the desired time before the assay process
was initiated.

FRET-TDM Native PAGE Assays
Msmeg strains were cultured in M63 medium until exponential
phase and
then pelleted by centrifugation (cells pellets were stored at −80
°C if needed). Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100). The resuspended cells were then
transferred to screw-top microcentrifuge tubes containing ∼0.25
mL of 0.1 mm silica beads. The cells were mechanically lysed with
an MP Biomedicals FastPrep-24 bead beater, three times at 5.0 m/s
for 20 s. Between each cycle, the cells were cooled on ice for 5 min.
The lysates were transferred into 15 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged
at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and transferred
to new tubes, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford
assay using BSA as a standard to facilitate equal protein loading
onto native gels.

For gel electrophoresis, 5–10 μg
proteins were resolved on a 7.6% Tris-native gel containing 25% glycerol
with no SDS. Protein samples were mixed with 3 μL of 6×
sample loading buffer without SDS (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 60% glycerol,
0.02% w/v bromophenol blue). The sample volumes were adjusted to 25
μL with Milli-Q water and loaded onto the gels. The proteins
were resolved by electrophoresis using 1× Tris-glycine running
buffer without SDS at constant voltage of 100 V for 4 h in a cold
room (4 °C). The running buffer was kept cold by using an ice
pack. After electrophoresis, the gels were rinsed with prechilled
Milli-Q water and then treated for less than 30 s with 500 μL
of 10 μM FRET-TDM in 1× PBS (prepared from 1 mM DMSO stock).
In-gel fluorescence was detected with a Typhoon FLA 7000 (GE Healthcare
Life Science) using the fluorescein excitation/emission filter. Identical
gels run in parallel, but not treated with FRET-TDM, were fixed for
15 min (40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid in water), washed three times,
5 min each with Milli-Q water, and then stained overnight at room
temperature with gentle agitation in QC Colloidal Coomassie stain
(Bio-Rad). The gels were destained in water for 3 h, changing the
water each hour. The Coomassie-stained gel was imaged using a ChemiDoc
Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and processed by Image Lab software
version 6.0 (Bio-Rad).
