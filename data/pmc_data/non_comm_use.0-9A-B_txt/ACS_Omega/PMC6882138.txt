Deintercalation of carbonate from
layered double hydroxides (LDH)
followed by intercalation of another anion (decarbonative intercalation)
is a good method for the synthesis of crystalline LDH with different
intercalated anions. We have carried out decarbonative intercalation
of halides, nitrate, acetate, and sulfate by refluxing the carbonate-LDH
with the corresponding ammonium salt in 1-butanol to obtain ordered
LDH incorporating the desired anion. The crystallinity of the precursor
LDH is retained in the anion-exchanged products, making this reaction
a useful tool to prepare ordered LDH containing various anions. In
addition, the morphology of the LDH is also retained after the exchange,
making the reaction morphotactic. As the reaction is facilitated by
the weak acidity of the ammonium salt, just grinding the carbonate-LDH
with the ammonium salt of the desired anion also results in anion
exchange. However, while the crystallinity of the LDH is retained,
the morphology changes possibly due to breaking up of the crystals
during the reaction.

Introduction
Layered double hydroxides (LDH) or hydrotalcite-like
compounds
(HTLC) can be represented by the general formula [M(1–x)2+M(x)3+(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n·mH2O, where M2+ is a divalent metal ion, M3+ is a trivalent metal ion,
and An– is the charge-balancing
interlayer anion.1 These compounds find
applications in varied fields, including sorption, catalysis, electrochemistry,
and drug delivery.2−10 Naturally occurring mineral hydrotalcite,11 whose formula is Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3)·4H2O, belongs to this class and has carbonate
in its interlayer as the charge-balancing interlayer anion. Carbonate
anions are known to be held tenaciously in the interlayer, which restricts
its use in the synthesis of LDH with other interlayer anions, and
thus, chloride- or nitrate-containing LDH are generally preferred
as the starting precursors for the synthesis of other derived LDH
through anion exchange.12 However, this
results in products with low crystallinity and the products are generally
subjected to postsynthesis hydrothermal treatment to obtain better
crystallinity. Also, synthesis of LDH with anion other than carbonate
requires prevention of contamination due to carbonate from atmospheric
carbon dioxide by a suitable method. Intercalation of a suitable anion
into a layered solid depends upon its selectivity/affinity for the
layered solid. There have been various studies on selective intercalation
of organic13−15 or inorganic16 anions
in layered solids, but it is well known that the selectivity of carbonate
toward LDH is very high, due to which its removal or intercalation
of ions other than carbonate in its presence becomes difficult.

Various methods for the deintercalation of carbonate ion to obtain
another anion-intercalated LDH with higher crystallinity have been
reported. It was observed that when takovite was treated with cold
dilute HCl, interlayer carbonate could be deintercalated and chloride
anions got intercalated.17 Decarbonative
intercalation of chloride could also be achieved by passing a stream
of water vapor and gaseous HCl through hydrotalcite sample maintained
at 140–160 °C in a glass tube.18 It was found that the decarbonation was better in the presence of
a salt with a common anion as that of the dilute acid used.19 It was proposed that deintercalation is enhanced
due to the protonation of carbonate ions in the interlayer space and
subsequent ion exchange of bicarbonate ions with a large excess of
Cl– ions present in solution. However, here the
decarbonated product showed small peaks due to carbonate ion in the
IR spectrum. It was found that decarbonation of CO3-LDH
is highly enhanced by adding NaCl to a dilute HCl solution to obtain
chloride-intercalated LDH and that 0.005 N HCl with 13 wt % NaCl was
required to obtain a pure chloride-intercalated LDH.20 It was easier to decarbonate Mg6Al2(OH)16(CO3)·mH2O compared to carbonate-richer Mg4Al2(OH)12(CO3)·mH2O. While
the decarbonation of the former could be achieved with a NaCl concentration
of ∼2 mol L–1, the latter required a NaCl
concentration of >4 mol L–1, and it proceeded
slower
than in the case of the former.20 When
using a salt–acid mixed solution for decarbonation, almost
complete substitution of carbonate ions was possible for the Cl– and Br– ions but not with I–, NO3–, and ClO4– ions even at high salt concentrations.21

Subsequently Iyi’s group used acetate
buffer/NaCl mixture
to obtain good-quality Cl– LDH.22 Later, they studied the decarbonation of carbonated LDH
using acetate buffer/salt mixture in a closed vessel and under N2 flow.23 It was found that N2 flow gives better decarbonation and requires lower concentration
of the salt for complete decarbonation. It has also been shown that
acid–alcohol mixed solutions could be used for decarbonation
of LDH to form the LDH intercalated with the corresponding conjugate
base of the acid used.24

Although
there have been quite a few methods for the ion exchange
of carbonate-LDH by other ions, many of them are limited to few anions,
and in the methods involving acids, the yields would be low due to
the dissolution of the LDH. Hence, it is important to find a universal
method that could be employed to exchange the interlayer carbonate
of LDH with a variety of anions.

In the IR spectrum of MgAl–CO3 LDH heated to
100 °C, the water–carbonate IR absorption appearing around
3165 cm–1 disappears and the antisymmetric stretching
mode ν3 of carbonate appearing at ∼1365 cm–1 splits into two bands at 1357 and 1391 cm–1 and a sharp band around 1538 cm–1 appears, which
indicate a change in the carbonate symmetry upon dehydration of the
hydrotalcite at 100 °C.25 The loss
of water molecules breaks the H-bonding network and weakens the bonding
of interlayer carbonate with the layers. Olanrewaju et al. reasoned
that the presence of ammonia in solution prevents carbonate from getting
intercalated into the interlayer of LDH, as seen by them during their
modified synthesis of nitrate-LDH.26 Iyi
et al. showed that chloride ion can replace the interlayer carbonate
when the LDH is reacted with ammonium chloride or amine salts of HCl
in methanol/ethanol.27 Keeping these in
mind, we have carried out decarbonative anion exchange using ammonium
salt of the anion of interest at 120 °C in 1-butanol. This procedure
is shown to be a general method for the synthesis of desired LDH with
better crystallinity from carbonate-LDH in a single step. We have
also carried out the reaction between carbonate-LDH and ammonium salt
under solvent-free mechanical grinding.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of MgAl LDH, Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O and
NiAl LDH, Ni2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O
The crystalline carbonated
LDH, Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O, was prepared by modifying
the method reported by Rao et al.28 A 50
mL aqueous solution containing 5.13 g of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, 3.75 g of Al(NO3)3·6H2O, and 9.12 g of urea was subjected to hydrothermal treatment
at 180 °C for 2 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.
The product was separated by centrifugation, washed with water, and
dried at 65 °C in an air oven to constant weight. Ni2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O LDH was prepared by adding a solution containing 0.03
mol nickel nitrate, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.015 mol aluminum nitrate, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, into 50 cm3 of a solution containing
0.11 mol sodium hydroxide and 0.05 mol sodium carbonate. The material
obtained was hydrothermally treated at 130 °C for 48 h.29 The product was then washed with deionized water
and dried at 65 °C in an air oven to constant weight.

Anion
Exchange Reactions of Carbonate-LDH with Various Anions
in 1-Butanol
For achieving nitrate exchange in hydrotalcite,
300 mg of the Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O LDH was dispersed
in 100 cm3 of 1-butanol containing 150 mg of ammonium nitrate
(1.87 mmol, 3 times the anion exchange capacity) in a round-bottom
flask and the mixture was refluxed for 24 h. The product was separated
by centrifugation, washed with acetone, and dried in an air oven at
65 °C to constant weight. Same procedure was followed for the
exchange by bromide and acetate ions [180 mg of ammonium bromide (1.84
mmol) and 140 mg of ammonium acetate (1.82 mmol) were used for bromide
and acetate exchange, respectively]. For iodide exchange, the procedure
was same except for the amount of ammonium salt used [368 mg (2.54
mmol), 6 times the anion exchange capacity]. For chloride and sulfate
exchange, in addition to increased amount the ammonium salt (6 times
the anion exchange capacity), the duration of refluxing was also doubled.
The product after sulfate exchange needed additional washing by decarbonated
water after acetone wash. Similar exchange reactions of NiAl LDH were
also carried out.

Mechanochemical Anion Exchange Reactions
For achieving
nitrate exchange in MgAl LDH, a mixture containing 300 mg of Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O LDH, 320 mg of ammonium nitrate (3.98 mmol,
∼6 times the anion exchange capacity), and a few drops of cyclohexane
was ground in a pestle and mortar for 45 min. The product was washed
with ethanol followed by water to remove excess ammonium salt and
dried at 65 °C. Halide and sulfate exchanges were also carried
out by the same procedure.

Characterization
The chemical composition
of the precursor
MgAl LDH was arrived at by wet chemical analysis and thermogravimetry
(TGA). Mg and Al contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry
(AAS) using a Varion AA240 spectrometer, and the water content was
estimated by TGA using a PerkinElmer STA 6000 thermal analyzer (30–900
°C, 10 °C/min). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
were performed on a PANalytical X’pert Pro X-ray Diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV, at a scanning
rate of 1° min–1. The infrared (IR) spectra
of samples were collected using a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FT-IR spectrometer
operated in ATR mode, in the range 4000–550 cm–1 with 4 cm–1 resolution. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images were recorded using a Zeiss, Ultra 55 SIRION field emission
microscope.

Results and Discussion
The chemical
composition of the precursor carbonate-intercalated
MgAl LDH is as expected from the nominal formula Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O. The mass percentages of Mg, Al, and water in the sample
are 20.1 (expected: 20.3), 11.6 (expected: 11.3), and 13.5 leading
to the formula Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·1.8H2O. The slight excess of water is possibly
due to adsorbed moisture. The net mass loss 44.6% (expected 45.2%)
observed in TGA also matches with this formula.

We carried out
the reaction between carbonate-intercalated MgAl
LDH and ammonium chloride in 1-butanol for 8, 16, and 24 h to optimize
the reaction time. Figure 1 compares the XRD patterns and IR spectra of the products
obtained in these reactions. The basal reflection increases (Figure 1A) and the carbonate
content decreases (Figure 1B) with reaction time. Based on the intensities of the carbonate
absorption in IR spectra (Figure 1B), it is estimated that the reaction is ∼90%
complete in 8 h. The exchange is ∼97% complete when the reaction
was carried out for 24 h. There was no appreciable improvement when
the reaction time was further increased. To optimize the amount of
ammonium salt, the reaction was carried out for 24 h with the amount
of ammonium nitrate varied from 1× to 6×, with × being
twice the no of moles of carbonate in LDH. The evolution of XRD pattern
with the amount of ammonium salt (Figure 2) suggests that complete exchange is achieved
when the amount of ammonium salt is 3×. Thus, all of the reactions
were carried out for 24 h with the amount of ammonium salt being 3×.

of ammonium chloride with Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O.

on the reaction of 1× (a), 2× (b), and 3× (c) of ammonium
nitrate with Mg2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·mH2O (× = twice the
number of moles of carbonate in LDH).

Success of the decarbonative anion exchange in LDH under the optimized
reaction conditions could be corroborated from the changes observed
in basal spacing along with the IR spectra of the final products.
In Figure 3, the XRD
pattern of the starting carbonate-intercalated MgAl LDH is compared
to that of the products obtained on decarbonative anion exchange with
halides. The starting carbonate-intercalated MgAl LDH with a basal
spacing of 7.5 Å is crystalline and its set of reflections in
the range 2θ = 30–65° suggests that the LDH is the
3R1 polytype.30 The halide-exchanged
LDHs show modified basal spacings −7.7 Å for MgAl-chloride,
7.8 for MgAl-bromide, and 8.2 Å for MgAl-iodide obtained through
decarbonation of the starting carbonate-intercalated LDH using the
corresponding ammonium salts—confirming the conversion of the
carbonated LDH to the desired anion-intercalated LDH. The XRD patterns
of all of the halide-exchanged products could also be indexed to 3R1 polytype, suggesting a topotactic transformation. In the
halide-exchanged products, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of
the 003 reflections of the products remains the same as that of the
precursor carbonate-LDH (Table 1), suggesting that the platelet thickness and ordering along
the layer stacking direction are not altered during the anion exchange
reaction. The FWHM of 01 and 11 reflections
of chloride- and bromide-exchanged
samples are also comparable to that of the precursor LDH (Table 1) suggesting that
the ordering along the a and b directions
are also retained in the anion exchange reaction. In the case of iodide-exchanged
product, the pattern could be indexed to a three-layer polytype,30 but some of the prominent reflections of the
3R1 polytype are missing. In addition, the reflections
due to planes in which h or k ≠
0 are broadened, indicating lower crystallinity compared to the precursor
LDH. This may be attributed to the larger size of the iodide ion.
There are also three weak reflections at 11.1, 5.5, and 3.7 Å
(marked with a red star in Figure 3d) due to a possible layered impurity, the nature of
which is unclear.

In Figure 4, the
XRD patterns of the nitrate-, acetate-, and sulfate-exchanged products
are compared to that of the precursor carbonate-LDH. The pattern of
the nitrate-exchanged product could be indexed to 3R1 polytype,30 and the FWHM values of the Bragg reflections
(Table 1) suggest retention
of crystallinity. In the case of acetate-exchanged product, the pattern
could be indexed to 3R1 polytype,30 but the non-hk0 reflections are broadened, suggesting
disorder along the a and b directions.
The crystallinity of the sulfate-exchanged product is quite poor compared
to the precursor LDH. The pattern could be indexed to 3H1 polytype.30 The loss of crystallinity
here can be attributed to the polytypic transformation that would
demand reorganization of the crystal through rotation of the metal
hydroxide slabs.

its nitrate-
(b), acetate- (c), and sulfate (d)-exchanged products. The expanded
pattern in the region 2θ = 30–65° has been overlaid
in each case.

The extent of carbonate exchange
can be quantitatively observed
from the IR spectra of the ion-exchanged products shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the characteristic IR absorption
observed around 3070 cm–1 for the carbonate-intercalated
LDH is due to the −OH stretching of interlayer water arising
from the strong interaction between interlayer water and the carbonate
ion.31 The band around 1365 cm–1 is due to the antisymmetric stretching mode ν3 of
carbonate, and the bands observed around 870 and 678 cm–1 are attributed to the weak nonplanar bending mode ν2 and the angular bending mode ν4 of carbonate, respectively.
In the IR spectrum of bromide-exchanged product (Figure 5b), the characteristic bands
due to carbonate are totally absent, confirming 100% exchange by bromide
ions. The acetate-exchanged product shows characteristic bands due
to acetate ion, and the bands due to carbonate are absent (Figure 5c). The IR absorption
observed in Figure 5d at 1126 cm–1 can be attributed to stretching
mode ν3 of sulfate, and the weak bands observed around
614 and 981 cm–1 can be attributed to bending modes
ν2 and symmetric stretching mode ν1, respectively, for the sulfate anion.31

(b), acetate- (c), and sulfate (d)-exchanged products.

If the anion exchange reaction occurs by a topotactic mechanism,
the morphology of the starting carbonate should be preserved. In Figure 6, we compare the
SEM images of the anion-exchanged products with that of the precursor
carbonate-LDH. The precursor LDH (Figure 6a) presents a near-uniform morphology with
the crystallites being hexagonal platelets of near-uniform dimensions.
The diameters of the platelets range from 1.5 to 2 μm. In the
bromide- (Figure 6b)
and nitrate (Figure 6c)-exchanged samples also, the hexagonal platelet morphology is retained,
and the average diameter of the platelets is the same as that of the
precursor LDH. Thus, the anion exchange reaction here is morphotactic.

of carbonate-intercalated MgAl LDH (a); its bromide-
(b) and nitrate (c)-exchanged products; and MgAl carbonate-LDH obtained
by reexchanging of bromide-exchanged LDH (d).

To check if the crystallinity of the LDH would be retained if we
reexchange the anion with carbonate, we carried out carbonate exchange
on the nitrate- and bromide-exchanged LDH by stirring the anion-exchanged
LDH in sodium carbonate solution for 24 h. The XRD patterns of the
reexchanged products match that of the precursor LDH, and the FWHM
values of the Bragg reflections are comparable (Figure 7, Table 1). In fact, even after a few cycles of carbonate-to-bromide-to-carbonate
exchanges, the crystallinity is intact (Figure 7d,e). The hexagonal platelet morphology of
the platelets is also retained after four cycles of anion exchange
(Figure 6d).

MgAl carbonate LDHs obtained by reexchange of nitrate (b) and bromide
(c) LDH. XRD patterns of MgAl carbonate LDHs obtained after two (d)
and four (e) cycles of carbonate-to-bromide-to-carbonate exchange.

Once we ascertained the versatility with respect
to the incoming
anion, we wanted to check if the method works well for LDH other than
MgAl LDH. When the decarboxylative anion exchange was carried out
for NiAl–CO3-LDH, we obtained similar results. In Figure 8, XRD patterns of
carbonate-intercalated NiAl LDH and its ion-exchanged products are
shown. The basal spacing of 7.6 Å for the starting carbonate
NiAl LDH changes to 8.9 Å for nitrate, 7.8 Å for chloride,
and 8.7 Å for sulfate-exchanged products, confirming anion exchange.
The absence of characteristic absorptions of carbonate in the IR spectra
of the anion-exchanged products (data not shown) suggests complete
exchange in all of the three cases. This indicates that the method
could be used for all LDH.

LDH (a); its nitrate-
(b), chloride- (c), and sulfate (d)-exchanged products.

Although the exchange method does not involve an acid, the
exchange
is probably facilitated by acids produced when the ammonium salt undergoes
hydrolysis. The adsorbed and interlayer water released by LDH on heating
hydrolyzes the ammonium salt. The mechanism of the exchange reaction
may be represented in the following reaction sequence    The formation of
NH3 and CO2 in the reaction was confirmed by
passing the vapor generated
during the reaction through Nessler’s reagent and lime water,
respectively. The ammonium ion hydrolyzes to form H3O+. The carbonate-intercalated LDH reacts with H3O+ and A– to give the anion-exchanged
product. The fact that there is no anion exchange when the reaction
is carried out at room temperature or at 60 °C suggests that
there is no solvolysis of the ammonium ion by 1-butanol.

If
the mechanism of the reaction is as described above, there is
no major role for 1-butanol except providing a medium for reaction
at an elevated temperature. Hence, it should be possible to obtain
similar results when the reaction is carried out between carbonate-LDH
and ammonium salt of the desired anion in the absence of a solvent.
Such a reaction could be carried out mechanochemically—simply
by grinding the reactants together. Mechanochemical synthesis and
anion exchange reactions of LDH are known.32,33 However, no attempts have been made so far to use carbonate-intercalated
LDH as precursors for mechanochemical anion exchange. XRD patterns
of the products obtained on the mechanochemical reaction of MgAl carbonate-LDH
with ammonium salts of different anions are shown in Figure 9. Anion exchange occurs in
all of the cases as evidenced by the change in basal spacing 7.7,
7.7, 8.3, 8.8, and 8.8 Å for the products obtained on reaction
with NH4Cl, NH4Br, NH4I, NH4NO3, and (NH4)2SO4, respectively.
The IR spectra of the halide-exchanged products (Figure 10) show trace amounts of carbonate
unlike in the 1-butanol medium synthesis. The fwhm of the XRD peaks
of the products is similar to that of the precursor carbonate-LDH,
indicating retention of crystallinity. The SEM images of the products
(Figure 11) indicate
that the morphology is not retained. Possibly, the LDH crystallites
break into smaller ill-defined pieces during the mechanochemical reaction.

Conclusions
Carbonate could be deintercalated
from MgAl/NiAl LDH and quantitatively
replaced by a variety of monovalent anions such as chloride, bromide,
iodide, nitrate, acetate, and a divalent sulfate anion by treating
the carbonate-intercalated LDH with the corresponding ammonium salt
in 1-butanol at 120 °C. The method does not use acid, and the
products obtained retain the crystallinity and morphology of the precursor
LDH in most cases. The versatility and quantitative exchange for all
of the anions makes this method a useful tool in the preparation of
crystalline LDH with anions other than carbonate. The same reaction
could be carried out in the absence of 1-butanol under mechanochemical
condition. The products retain the crystallinity of the precursor,
but the morphology is lost. If one is not particular about the morphology
of the products, the mechanochemical method is good enough for the
exchange of carbonate ion by other anions in LDH. The mechanochemical
method is greener (as it involves no solvent), faster, and simpler.
