Emerging point-of-care diagnostic
tests capable of analyzing whole mammalian cells often rely on the
attachment of harvested cells to glass surfaces for subsequent molecular
characterization. We set out to develop and optimize a kit for the
diagnosis of lymphoma in low- and middle-income countries where access
to advanced healthcare testing is often absent or prone to error.
Here, we optimized a process for the lyophilization of neutravidin-coated
glass and cocktails of antibodies relevant to lymphoma diagnosis to
establish long-term stability of reagents required for point-of-care
cell capture technology. Lyophilized glass slides showed no decline
in their performance compared to freshly prepared neutravidin glass
and preserved capture efficiency for 5 weeks under easily attainable
storage conditions. We demonstrate the successful performance of the
low-cost, lyophilized kit in a cell capture assay to enable true point-of-care
analyses under adverse conditions. We anticipate that the strategy
can be expanded to other cancer cell types or cell-derived vesicle
analysis.

Introduction
Global healthcare is
slowly becoming a reality given significant advances in bioengineering,
miniaturization, affordable manufacturing costs, and the rising socioeconomic
status of many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, significant
hurdles persist, particularly in the development of cell-based assays.
Such assays are of particular importance in global oncology, where
they would allow healthcare providers to establish the diagnosis and
subtype of cancer1−4 as well as enhancing the diagnosis of communicable diseases, particularly
those where tissue or biofluid sampling is often required (i.e., Legionella,5 mycobacteria, or Pneumocystis species6). For many
of these applications, it is often necessary to capture cells onto
glass slides for subsequent interrogation by plasmonic, fluorescence,
holographic, or other means of imaging. Yet, adverse environmental
conditions in primary care settings, paired with a lack of reagents
and a scarcity of highly trained specialists, have made such evaluations
difficult and prone to error.

We have previously developed a
holographic method to diagnose lymphoma in LMIC; the device uses contrast-enhanced
microholography and a deep-learning algorithm to directly analyze
percutaneously obtained fine-needle aspirates.1 Lymphomas constitute a heterogeneous collection of diseases with
diverse natural histories and treatment responses. Clinical prognostication
and selection of appropriate therapeutic options for each subtype
require accurate classification, based, in developed countries, on
review of cellular markers, histology, and molecular analysis by specialized
hematopathologists. In our prior work, we demonstrated the feasibility
and high accuracy of the holographic device in characterizing cells;
we also developed a concise algorithm to classify benign vs malignant
and low-grade vs aggressive cellular populations from clinical biopsies,
based on a tailored panel of cell markers.1 The diagnostic accuracy of this approach was prospectively validated
in 40 patients referred for image-guided aspiration of nodal mass
lesions suspicious for lymphoma. The studies, however, were conducted
with freshly prepared reagents in fluid-based form and required multistep
protocols for the preparation of the analytical toolkit at the time
of analysis, which is exceptionally challenging in sub-Saharan countries.
In the current study, we thus extended these proof-of-principle experiments
to develop glass capture technology and experimental conditions that
are suitable for long-term storage, single-step point-of-care reconstitution,
and more resistant to heat and humidity. Specifically, we optimized
a capture technology for cells onto lyophilized neutravidin-coated
glass slides and developed quality control procedures to assure uniformity.
We show that these improved methods are superior compared to commercially
available reagents and enable true point-of-care analyses under adverse
conditions in highly reproducible form. Finally, the methods may be
extendable to vesicles7 and other biomarkers.

Results
Figure 1 provides
an overview of the three experimental aspects: (i) glass activation,
for deposition of a high-density neutravidin monolayer; (ii) kit preparation,
incorporating both biotinylated antibodies for cellular capture and
fluorescently labeled imaging probes; (iii) cellular analysis. Because
the stringent storage and handling conditions specified by the manufacturers
of commercially available streptavidin-coated glass slides—shipped
on ice or dry ice, stored in sealed packaging at −20/–80
°C—were poorly suited for assay implementation in the
LMIC context we sought, we optimized our own approach for the preparation
and long-term storage of capture slides (Figure 1a). Antibody cocktails containing both biotinylated
antibodies for cell capture and labeled antibodies as additional markers
were also lyophilized in a single kit with trehalose and other excipients
(see Materials and Methods) to prevent protein
denaturation (Figure 1b). Finally, cells stained with the antibody kit are captured onto
the reconstituted neutravidin glass for imaging and analysis (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 Glass chemistry and schematic
overview. (a) Glass coverslips modified with a high-density layer
of neutravidin are lyophilized for long-term storage stabilized by
trehalose. (b) Cells are immunostained with a lyophilized antibody
cocktail that contains both capture and staining antibodies. (c) Cells
are captured via biotinylated antibodies in a flow-cell cartridge
containing rehydrated neutravidin glass for analysis.

Freshly cleaned glass coverslips in a multislide
holder (50 coverslips per batch) are silanized with 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES) followed by treatment with glutaraldehyde.1,8 Serial
preparations demonstrated that rigorous stirring of the reaction mixture
at each stage was necessary to produce a homogeneous surface. In the
final step, reductive amination chemistry conjugates lysine residues
on neutravidin to the aldehyde-functionalized surface, yielding high-density
neutravidin-coated glass (Figure 1a).

To explore the preservation of the neutravidin
activity after long-term storage, the glass slides were lyophilized
in a range of buffer (succinate, histidine, phosphate), pH (5–7),
and lyoprotectant (sucrose, trehalose) conditions (data not shown).
We found that the presence of trehalose as a lyoprotectant (Figure 1a) in Milli-Q water
provided optimum reconstitution, as buffer salts deposited on the
glass surface during the lyophilization process made the recovery
of an optically clear substrate challenging within the planned LMIC-compatible
assay techniques. Subsequent experiments (vide infra) were conducted
to define the relationship between the trehalose concentration and
slide durability in storage.

Methods to measure the surface
density of coated glass or silica surfaces have frequently relied
on highly specialized techniques such as atomic force microscopy and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.9,10 We sought
to benchmark the neutravidin functionalization of the glass surface
by more readily available fluorescence imaging. To that end, we first
assessed the ability of a direct biotin-fluorophore conjugate (AF594-biotin)
to optically interrogate neutravidin/streptavidin density. The signal/background
of the resulting images was poor, even at 3 s exposure times (Figure S1). We thus implemented a secondary antibody-based
amplification step to indirectly visualize the neutravidin surface
layer. Functionalized and blocked protein-coated surfaces were incubated
with the biotinylated mouse anti-CD20 capture antibody used in our
cellular assays, followed by a suitable fluorescent secondary antibody
(AlexaFluor647 goat anti-mouse). The resulting signal amplification
enabled us to readily quantify the surface coating density and visualize
defects in the surface, whether mechanical (e.g., pipette tip scratches)
or chemical (from inhomogeneous labeling). The surface of neutravidin
coverslips showed approximately 10 times higher fluorescence intensity
over background than a commercial streptavidin glass slide (Figure 2a). Control images
with no primary antibody were equivalent to the no-coating control,
verifying the specificity of staining. Comparative fluorescence images
demonstrate the lower surface modification density of the commercial
glass and comparably low spatial heterogeneity (Figure 2b). Both commercial streptavidin glass and
our neutravidin coverslips revealed a susceptibility to mechanical
damage to the protein layer that was readily visualized with our imaging
method, highlighting a need for gentle handling.

and cell capture efficiency. Surface modification of prepared neutravidin
glass and a commercial streptavidin slide was analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy after staining with biotinylated antibody and secondary
antibody fluorescence amplification. (a) Fluorescence intensity plot

comparison of lyophilized neutravidin glass and a commercial streptavidin
slide. The prepared neutravidin glass showed a greater modification
density than commercial streptavidin glass. Scale bar = 200 μm.
(c) Capture efficiency of lyophilized neutravidin glass by biotinylated
antibodies was compared to freshly prepared neutravidin glass and
commercial streptavidin glass with a B-cell lymphoma cell line (DB)
and a nonspecific T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat). p = 0.98 between fresh and lyophilized glass capture, p < 0.0001 between both fresh/lyophilized and commercial glass
capture.

Reconstitution of the lyophilized
neutravidin glass was tested by comparing B-cell capture efficiency
to that of freshly prepared neutravidin glass. We used B-cell lymphoma
cell lines (Daudi and DB) and the Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell line
to create a standardized panel that encompasses the key positive/negative
markers for clinical biopsy samples.1 CD19/20+
DB cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-CD19 and anti-CD20
antibodies (Table S1) and then rigorously
washed to remove any excess/unbound antibody, which can markedly inhibit
capture. Cells in suspension were pipetted into a 1 mm adhesive silicone
flow cell applied to the neutravidin coverslips, incubated for 10
min with rotatory rocking, imaged to quantify baseline density, and
then washed with a syringe pump (see Materials and
Methods for further details). Capture efficiencies were defined
by the number of cells retained in the postwash image per field of
view and found to be 85–90% for both fresh and lyophilized
glass, indicating no loss in neutravidin functionality post-lyophilization
(Figure 2c). DB cells
stained with matching concentrations of a biotinylated isotype control
antibody exhibited capture efficiencies of less than 12% for both
fresh/lyophilized glass. Lyophilized neutravidin glass did not show
an increase in nonspecific capture of CD19/20 negative Jurkat cells
compared to fresh neutravidin (18% for lyophilized neutravidin, 23%
for fresh neutravidin). The performance of the high-density prepared
neutravidin glass was far superior compared to a commercial streptavidin
slide, which demonstrated only 5% mean capture efficiency (Figure 2c).

Given these
encouraging results, we next attempted to define the importance of
lyoprotectants in the slide preparation and to quantify effects of
temperature and storage conditions on the cell capture (Figure 3). Stabilization of the neutravidin
surface by trehalose for long-term storage was investigated and optimized
by soaking the neutravidin glass in various concentrations of trehalose
prior to lyophilization at room temperature overnight. The surface
chemistry stabilization of the lyophilized slides was examined with
the B-cell capture protocol (as above) upon reconstitution with PBS
(Figure 3a). When neutravidin
was stabilized with 1% trehalose solution, DB cell capture efficiency
was equivalent to that of the fresh neutravidin glass. In the absence
of trehalose, capture efficiency was markedly reduced (38%) compared
to the fresh glass. At higher trehalose concentration, capture efficiency
decreased to 82%. Based on these results, 1% trehalose was used for
further neutravidin glass stability kinetics.

Figure 3 Optimization and stability
of lyophilized neutravidin glass. (a) Capture efficiency of lyophilized
neutravidin coverglass stabilized with different concentrations of
trehalose (p = 0.99 between fresh and 1% trehalose).
(b) Capture efficiency was stable after 24 h at 4–37 °C
(p ≥ 0.6 for all comparisons). After 1 week
of storage, a decline in capture efficiency was observed for cells
stored at 30 °C (p = 0.49) and 37 °C (p < 0.01). (c) Slides stored at 4 °C for 5 weeks
performed equivalently to the freshly prepared glass (p = 0.86).

Batches of stabilized, lyophilized
neutravidin glass were stored under desiccated conditions at a range
of environmentally relevant temperatures and serially tested for B-cell
capture. Lyophilized glass could withstand temperatures up to 37 °C
for 24 h with no decrease in cell capture efficiency (Figure 3b). Only minor declines in
cell capture were observed after 1 week in storage at room temperature
(96%). However, after 1 week at higher temperatures, capture efficiency
decreased to 81% with storage at 30 °C and 40% with storage at
37 °C. Lyophilized neutravidin slides stored at room temperature
still maintained 85% capture efficiency after 4 weeks, consistent
with a decay t1/2 of ≥10 weeks,
more than sufficient for brief interruptions in refrigeration during
shipping or transit to remote sites (e.g., satellite hospitals or
remote clinics). Appealingly, the lyophilized neutravidin glass stored
at 4 °C demonstrated capture efficiency equal to that of freshly
prepared neutravidin glass even after 5 weeks (Figure 3c).

To extend a lyophilized kit to
the full ensemble of reagents for molecular cell labeling, we also
lyophilized biotinylated anti-CD19 and anti-CD20, anti-kappa light
chain, anti-lambda light chain, and anti-Ki67 antibodies in a custom
formulation containing trehalose, polysorbate 20, and succinic acid
as stabilizers (see Materials and Methods),
which we arrived at after iteratively screening a range of buffer/excipient
compositions for each antibody individually. This antibody cocktail
contains the most relevant molecular markers to distinguish between
aggressive and indolent lymphoma subtypes in clinical lymphoma diagnosis.11 Optimization of the lyophilization conditions
revealed that pH and buffer composition had a large impact on the
activity of the lyophilized antibodies as certain antibodies had markedly
poorer staining performance in particular buffers (Figure S2). Successful lyophilization of the antibodies was
validated by flow cytometry quantification of the corresponding targets
in Daudi (CD19/20+, kappa+), DB (CD19/20+, lambda+), or Jurkat cells
(CD19/20–, Ki67+) before and after lyophilization. The fluorescence
signal of the lyophilized antibodies showed little to no change compared
to the fresh antibody staining (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Biological characterization of the lyophilized antibody
panel. Flow cytometry validation of the activity of lyophilized antibodies
(gray) compared to fresh antibodies (red).

To demonstrate the performance of the capture assay with
the full array of lyophilized materials, lymphoma cells stained with
lyophilized/reconstituted fluorescently labeled kappa light chain,
lambda light chain, and Ki67 were imaged after capturing by lyophilized/reconstituted
biotinylated anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 antibodies onto lyophilized/reconstituted
neutravidin glass (Figure 5). Daudi and DB cells showed efficient capture, as expected,
relative to low levels of nonspecific binding for Jurkat cells. All
cells were DAPI stained for visualization. As expected, kappa and
Ki67 expressions were high in Daudi cells, whereas lambda and Ki67
expressions were high in DB cells; Jurkat cells were positive only
for Ki67, completing the panel and verifying capture and immunostaining
of cancer cells with the lyophilized kit and functionalized glass.

show high capture, whereas Jurkat cells (CD19/20−) show low
capture, as expected. All cells are positive for Ki67. Scale bar =
50 μm.

Discussion
The
analysis of human cells immobilized on glass slides represents the
mainstay of modern, nondestructive cytoanalysis. Typically such studies
are performed in well-equipped laboratories and clinical facilities
specialized in immunolabeling. However, bringing these technologies
to point-of-care sites has been far more challenging, especially in
LMIC where additional hurdles and adverse environmental conditions
exist. Here, we show that glass slides can be activated, lyophilized,
and used for immunocapture and subsequent analysis, all in kit format.
As a part of NCI’s Center for Global Health and their Affordable
Cancer Technologies program (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cgh), we are preparing to use the developed technology to perform clinical
trials in Africa with previously developed analysis techniques for
cell capture such as artificial intelligence diffraction analysis4 and a low-cost contrast-enhanced micrography
device that has been validated in a clinical trial for the molecular
diagnosis of lymphoma.1 The trials will
be conducted in Botswana in both hospital and rural health center
settings. Refrigeration (4 °C) is available for longer-term storage
at a central facility but not readily maintained during periods of
shipping or transport to rural locations for on-site use. The major
advantages of this approach are manifold including: (i) more efficient
use of expensive specialty reagents; (ii) expanding the shelf-life
of “kits” from hours to weeks or months; (iii) simplification
of multistep procedures so that they can be performed by a less skilled
workforce, and (iv) reduction in assay cost. The capture of the cells
to the durable neutravidin surface via CD19 and CD20 enriches the
bulk fine-needle aspirate for the relevant B-cell subpopulation, enabling
the three-channel analysis of clonality (kappa, lambda) and proliferation
rate (Ki67) for diagnostic classification. Immunophenotypic isolation
thus reduces the number of independent channels required for imaging,
a key technical challenge for portable, low-cost fluorescence microscopes
and/or smartphone-based imaging systems.12

Extensive optimization of the stabilization of individual
monoclonal antibodies by sugars and other excipients during lyophilization
has been achieved in the pharmaceutical industry for antibodies licensed
as lyophilized powders.13−15 Nevertheless, only a few commercial
methods are available for lyophilizing multiple-antibody cocktails
for diagnostic assays, all of which rely on proprietary buffer formulations
and techniques.16,17 Here, we demonstrated a simple,
low-cost strategy for preparing lyophilized, ready-to-use antibody
cocktails containing up to five different antibody markers, stabilized
with only common laboratory reagents.

Several previous studies
have used glass activation for biosensors18 and cell capture applications.19 Although
these laboratory-specific approaches for the preparation of monolayer
functionalized glass (e.g., aminosilanes, aldehydes) have an extended
track record,20−22 the methods have been tailored for on-demand preparation,
precisely the scenario we set out to avoid. In keeping with the objective
of procedural simplicity at the point of analysis, the lyophilized
neutravidin glass and antibody cocktail require only rehydration (≤5
min) to be ready for use. Moreover, our approach is unique in that
it tackles the clinical problem of lymphoma diagnostics in LMIC. The
most common lymphoma subtypes in sub-Saharan Africa are diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, classical Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.23,24 Optimal standard therapies differ for the various subtypes of lymphoma,
as does the expected clinical course across a broad spectrum of outcomes
(i.e., from indolent and non-life-threatening to rapidly progressive
and potentially fatal); the current lack of new technology to facilitate
correct diagnosis/prognosis is thus a major problem.25,26 Immunohistochemical studies and other key elements of molecular
pathology continue to have very limited availability in the LMIC of
Africa.27 We hope that the approach here
is a first step toward triaging patients with suspected lymphoma to
the most appropriate treatment and/or clinical observation strategy.
Beyond the tested antibody cocktails, we anticipate that the strategy
can be expanded to other cancer cell types (e.g., breast, melanoma,
or lung cancer) or cell-derived vesicle analysis.7 Initial optimization experiments for the lyophilization
of breast cancer antibody cocktails are currently underway for clinical
applications.

Materials and Methods
Neutravidin Glass Preparation/Lyophilization
For reagents and supplies, see Table S1. Glass coverslips (22 mm × 22 mm, Gold Seal) were loaded into
coverslip racks (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and activated by immersing
the glass in 10 M NaOH for 20 min followed by 5 min sonication in
Milli-Q water 2 times. Coverslips were treated by immersion in a large
beaker with 2% (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) in 95:5 EtOH/H2O for 30 min with stirring, then rinsed 3 times with fresh
washes of 95% ethanol. The ethanol-washed slides were then submerged
in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2.5 h and then rinsed with a 5 min
sonication in Milli-Q water 2 times. Neutravidin (ThermoFisher) was
reconstituted from the lyophilized powder to prepare a stock solution
of 0.1 mg/mL in PBS and was deposited onto the glutaraldehyde glass
via reductive amination with 4.5 mM NaBH3CN by soaking
the coverslips in the reaction mixture in a shallow Petri dish for
2.5 h, followed by three washes with PBS. For long-term storage, neutravidin-coated
slides were soaked in 1% trehalose in Milli-Q water for 30 min. Excess
water was removed, and slides were lyophilized overnight at room temperature
on a VirTis FreezeMobile 25L freeze dryer (SP Scientific).

Neutravidin
Surface Fluorescence Imaging
Commercial and prepared neutravidin
glass was first blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS
for 1 h at room temperature. Glass slides were incubated with biotinylated
anti-CD20 capture antibody (15 μg/mL) for 30 min, washed, then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody (4 μg/mL)
for 30 min followed by washing with PBS. Fluorescent images of the
stained surfaces were acquired on an Olympus BX-63 upright automated
epifluorescence microscope excited with a Cy5 filter cube at 1 s exposure
time.

Antibody Lyophilization
Solutions containing 1 mg/mL
antibody, 60 mM trehalose, 0.01% polysorbate 20 in 5 mM succinate
buffer at pH 5 were frozen by immersing in liquid nitrogen, then lyophilized
at 4 °C for 5 h followed by lyophilization at room temperature
overnight on a VirTis FreezeMobile 25L freeze dryer (SP Scientific).

Assay Procedure
B-cell capture assay was performed as before.1 Briefly, lyophilized antibody cocktails containing
biotinylated anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 and either kappa light chain,
lambda light chain, or anti-Ki67 antibodies were reconstituted (10
μg/mL) and incubated with fixed, permeabilized (0.005% saponin)
cells for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 4 times with
the assay buffer to remove any unbound antibody. Lyophilized neutravidin
coverglass was reconstituted for 5 min in PBS, then incorporated into
a flow-cell cartridge consisting of a sticker-type hybridization chamber
(9 mm diameter and 1 mm depth, Grace Bio-labs), and blocked with 1%
BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody-labeled cells (10 000
based on a hemocytometer count of cell culture suspensions) were introduced
into the flow cell and incubated for 10 min on a variable speed nutating
mixer (Fisher Scientific, 30 rpm) to prevent nonspecific settling
onto the glass. CD19/20+ cells were captured by the neutravidin surface,
and unbound cells were removed by washing with 1 mL of total buffer
volume, delivered at a rate of 40 mL/h with a syringe pump and flexible
1 mm tubing. Pilot experiments demonstrated an important correlation
between chamber depth and appropriate flow rate for optimum differential
capture, with lower flow rates required for shallower chambers. The
assay buffer consisted of PBS supplemented with 2% BSA and 2% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Images were taken before and after washing (Figures S3 and S4) and quantified by first applying
a global threshold followed by automatic particle counting in ImageJ
to determine capture efficiency.

Flow Cytometry and Cell
Imaging
To validate the activity of the lyophilized antibodies,
flow cytometry was performed in lymphoma cell lines. Cells (500 000)
were stained with lyophilized antibody cocktails containing anti-CD19,
anti-CD20, and either anti-kappa light chain, anti-lambda light chain,
or anti-Ki67 (10 μg/mL). Alexa Fluor 405-conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (for kappa, lambda, and Ki67) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody (for CD19 and CD20) were used. Fluorescent
signals were measured with a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter)
and compared to fresh antibody cocktails and cells with no primary
antibody staining as a negative control (Figure S5).

Fluorescent images of captured cells were acquired
on an Olympus BX-63 upright automated epifluorescence microscope.
All cells were stained with DAPI and visualized post-capture with
a DAPI filter cube. Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-kappa light chain,
Alexa Fluor 532-conjugated anti-lambda light chain, and Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated anti-Ki67 markers were excited with traditional Cy5,
Cy3, and FITC filter cubes, respectively.

Cell Culture
Daudi
(Burkitt’s lymphoma), DB (germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL),
and Jurkat (T-cell leukemia) cell lines were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin at 37
°C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell lines
were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).

Statistics
Statistical
analyses and data plotting were performed in GraphPad Prism 7. Error
bars represent the standard deviation. A one-way analysis of variance
(Tukey correction for multiple comparisons) was used to determine
statistical significance.
