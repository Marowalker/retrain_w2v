Nearly
50 years have passed since the classic studies by Larson and Lister [Larson D. W. ; Lister M. W.  Can. J. Chem. 1968 , 46 , 823 ]and Hay and Leong [Hay R. W. ; Leong K. N.  J. Chem. Soc. A 1971 , 0 , 3639 ]on the copper-catalyzed decarboxylation
of acetonedicarboxylic acid (H3Acdica). Although the authors
laid the foundations for what we know about this reaction; still very
little information exists regarding the underlying aqueous metal-enol(ate)s
of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper. In this study, UV–visible
titrations revealed three pK values, pK[Cu(H2A)], pK[Cu(HA)], and
pK[Cu(A)]. We associated the first two
with ionization of α-carbon CH2 groups in [CuII(H2Acdica)keto]1+ and [CuII(HAcdica)keto]0 to form unstable metal-enolates,
{[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} and {[CuII(Acdica)enolate]}, which through β-carbonyl oxygen
protonation can form metal-enols [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ and [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0. The square-planar CuII center (electron
paramagnetic resonance results) plays a dual role of stabilizing negative
electron density at the β-carbonyl oxygen and as an electron
sink in [[CuI(HAcdica)enolate]0]‡ and [[CuI(Acdica)enolate]1–]‡ (confirmed through cyclic voltammetry
as two single 1e– transfers). The
π → π* transition associated with [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 was used to determine pK[Cu(A)] (deprotonation of enol OH) and enolization
rate constant (stopped-flow spectroscopy) but also exhibited a time-dependent
decrease in absorbance (on the order of min–1),
suggesting a new method to possibly obtain experimental values for
the estimated “kCuL” decarboxylation
rate constant of metal-enolate [CuL]1– calculated
by Larson and Lister. On the basis of our results, we postulate that
decarboxylation takes place primarily through {[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} and [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0. These results add to our understanding of aqueous metal-enol(ate)s,
which contain underlying CuII/I redox chemistry, “active
methylenes” and enol tautomers and enolate anions, which play
roles in many catalytic reactions of interdisciplinary importance.

Introduction
Naturally occurring
1,3- and 1,3,5-β-keto(carboxylic) acids
rely on β-carbonyl/α-carbon CH2 resonance to
form keto-enol tautomers and enolates with transition metals and have
remained as an area of continued research due to their wide importance
across chemical disciplines.1 Although
fundamental research studies, such as the metal-ion-catalyzed decarboxylation
of oxaloacetate,2−10 have provided detailed information on reaction mechanisms, other
studies seek to broaden our understanding of the biochemical significance
of metal-enol(ate)s. For example, in active sites of enolases, Serratia endopeptidase, dioxygenase, and in β-keto
acid cleavage enzymes, transition metals have been shown or postulated
to induce enolization and stabilize reactive enolates, which otherwise
do not exist at significant concentration at circumnetural pH.11−15 At physiological pH, deprotonation of β-keto acid α-carbon
CH2 is generally unfavorable in the absence of metal ions
or metalloenzymes, but in their presence, pathways for enol and enolate
formation open up.16 Copper exhibits some
of the strongest effects and has been shown to dramatically shift
the pKa of α-carbon-associated enol
and enolate species by an astonishing 10–12 pKa units.17 Metal-enolates are
also important in C–C bond forming reactions,18,19 during Cu/O2-catalyzed aliphatic oxidation of C–C
bonds, and include CuI/II redox chemistry, important to
understanding electron transfer mechanisms in catalytic copper cycles.20−22 In water treatment, environmental engineers have also indicated
the possible role of copper-enol(ate)s in catalyzing increased levels
of hazardous halogenated disinfectant by-products following chlorination.23

Despite a significant body of published
literature on β-keto(carboxylic)acid
copper complexes, we were surprised to find very little recent information
on the copper complexes associated with the copper-catalyzed decarboxylation
of acetonedicarboxylate. Acetonedicarboxylate is a naturally occurring
oxidative decarboxylation product of citric acid and is the much lesser
known “1,3” β-ketoglutarate isomer of krebs cycle
intermediate α-ketoglutarate.24,25

In its
ketonic form, acetonedicarboxylate has two acid dissociation
constants, that is, pKa1 = 3.23 and pKa2 = 4.27 at 0.01 M ionic strength and 25 °C.26 Although the keto forms are generally favored
in aqueous solution, the keto-enol tautomer equilibria may be dependent
on forward “enolization” (kE0, kE1, kE2) and reverse (kK0, kK1, kK2) “ketonization”
or deprotonation at the β-carbonyl oxygen (pKa3, pKa4) to form enolates
(shown in Scheme 1).
Although UV–visible spectroscopy has been used to confirm the
π → π* transition of the αβ carbonyl
π-system associated with “H3Acdica(enol)” (242 nm, ε = 294 M–1 cm–1) and enolate anion “Acdica3–” (268
nm, ε = 346 M–1 cm–1), a
significant increase in the decarboxylation rate constant of H2Acdica1– (2.90 × 10–3 min–1) in comparison to that of H3Acdica
(1.25 × 10–3 min–1) and HAcdica2– (0.10 × 10–3 min–1) led the authors to suggest a six-membered enol transition state
to explain the increase.26,27 There is no mention
in the current scientific literature on the possible (kE0, kE1, kE2) and (kK0, kK1, kK2) values and pKa’s (pKa3, pKa4) for acetonedicarboxylate (shown
in Scheme 1), but we
mention them here because the enol and enolate forms of the ligand
play a strong role in coordination to metal ions.8

Scheme 1 Structure of the Acetonedicarboxylic Acid Ligand Keto,
Enol, and
Enolate Species
Equilbria include acid dissociation
constants (pKa1, pKa2, pKa3, pKa4), ketonization rates (kK0, kK1, kK2), and enolization rates (kE0, kE1, kE2).

Without discussion of these possible equilibria in classic studies
on copper-catalyzed decarboxylation of acetonedicarboxylate, accurate
assignment of underlying metal-enol(ate)s would be difficult. Despite
this impediment, studies by Larson and Lister (1968), Hay and Leong
(1971), and Yerhoff and Larson (1972) left a significant legacy toward
our knowledge on metal-ion-catalyzed decarboxylation of acetonedicarboxylate.6,26,27 Larson and Lister determined
rate constants for copper-catalyzed decarboxylation of acetonedicarboxylate
(kCuA and kCuL for [CuA]0 and [CuL]1– complexes, respectively,
and kCu for overall), verified kCuA through monitoring absorbance at 400 nm,
the [CuA]0 stability constant (log KCuA = 2.049), and enolic proton dissociation constant (pKCuA(1968) = 3.81).27 They noticed that the level of enolization (Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) and acid/base behavior results) seemed much higher with CuII than with CoII, NiII, and ZnII complexes and postulated that decarboxylation active species involved
a six-membered enolate ring state (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Proposed Structures for [CuA]0 “[CuA(H2O)2]0”
and [CuL]1– “[CuL(H2O)2]1–“, and Key Results from Classic Studies
on the Copper-Catalyzed Decarboxylation
of Acetonedicarboxylate
Hay and Leong accepted the enolic dissociation constant
(pKCuA(1968) = 3.81), but bell-shaped
pH rate profiles
led them to postulate displacement of another proton at a higher pH
either from copper-coordinated H2O or a kinetically stable
copper-enolate (e.g., [CuL(H2O)2]1– shown in Scheme 2) to explain the rate decrease.26 Although
placement of the enolic C=C bond in [CuL]1– “[CuL(H2O)2]1–”
differed between that reported by Larson and Lister and that by Hay
and Leong, coordination through the Acdica3–(enolate) species was confirmed by Yerhoff and Larson through
isolation of a bright green metal-bridged polymer compound (NaCuL·XH2O, thermogravimetric analysis, FTIR, and powder
X-ray diffraction analysis).6 This verified
the existence of a metal-enolate but could not explain the chemistry
of any potential overlooked enol or enolate copper complexes in aqueous
solution or resolve which complexes were responsible for decarboxylation.

To address the unresolved issues brought up by these studies and
provide much needed insight into the aqueous metal-enol/enolate complexes
associated with the copper-catalyzed decarboxylation of acetonedicarboxylate,
we undertook the present study. Through our results, analysis, and
discussion, we were able to uncover the underlying chemical properties
of aqueous metal-enol and metal-enolate complexes that help in explaining
their reactivity in regard to catalyzing decarboxylation.

Results and Discussion
Electronic
Spectra and UV–Visible Spectral Titrations
for pKa Determination
We conducted
acid–base titrations (Figure S1),
but besides the readily discernable first derivative final equivalence
point (Figure S2), pKa values could not be determined with high accuracy. Before
pH 4.0, the (acetonedicarboxylato)copper solution was clear but became
light green between pH 4.0 and 4.5 and then the green color intensity
increased up to a pH of 7.00 where precipitates were visible (see Figures S1 and S3 for visual). Because of the
limitations of acid–base titrations, we turned to UV–visible
spectral titrations. In classic studies, only one band (400 nm) was
mentioned over the visible wavelength range and was used to conduct
a continuous method of variation plots and calculate the apparent
molar absorbance values of [CuA]0 (205 M–1 cm–1) and [CuL]1– (30 M–1 cm–1) from nonlinear regression
fitting to absorbance data.27 Additionally,
previous studies employed relatively large concentrations (on the
order of 10–3–10–2 M). Although
a high concentration would be beneficial to measure rates of decarboxylation,
higher concentrations may not be needed to analyze the UV region.
In our analysis of (acetondedicarboxylato)copper solution, we chose
concentrations of 14, 1.4, and 0.1 mM and scanned a wavelength range
from 190 to 900 nm. UV–visible spectral studies served a dual
purpose: (1) to further explore copper-based bands and intraligand
transitions and (2) to obtain new pKa values
through titrations. Visible spectra and titration of 14 and 1.4 mM
(acetonedicarboxylato)copper solutions are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 UV–visible spectral
titration of the (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
solution at different pH values: (a) 14 mM and (b) 1.4 mM. At 25 °C,
μ = 0.01 M (NaCl) and pH increments = 0.25. Spectral titration
curves plotted as a function of pH: (c) 14 mM solution titration data
used to find pK[Cu(H2A)] at 400 and 757
nm and (d) 1.4 mM solution titration data used to find pK[Cu(HA)] at 400 and 757 nm. Curve-fitted lines represent
the Henderson–Hesselbalch equation.

At pH 5.75 and above (14 mM solution), there was significant
formation
of green hydrolyzed solids, inhibiting further UV–visible spectral
analysis, but in 1.4 and 0.1 mM solutions, only a small portion of
hydrolyzed products appeared between pH 6.5 and 7.0. The two main
bands associated with copper complexes were at 400 nm (151 M–1 cm–1) and 757 nm (60.7 M–1 cm–1) (shown in Figure 1a,b). The molar absorbance in our study differed from
the apparent molar absorbance value for 400 nm (205 M–1 cm–1) calculated by Larson and Lister, primarily
due to differing methods of calculation. Following a short recalculation
to account for the difference in calculation methods and assumptions
(see Additional Experimental Methods section
of the Supporting Information), we obtained
a value much closer to ours (155.2 M–1 cm–1). Converting to energy, the 400 nm band (25 000 cm–1) is significantly higher than the weak transition at 757 nm (13 210
cm–1) and falls within the 20 000–25 000
cm–1 range associated with electronic charge-transfer
transitions in copper complexes.28,29 We associate
these bands with an enolic oxygen ligand-to-metal charge transfer,
(O)π → CuII transition, and d–d transition,
respectively. The 2p → d charge transfer between ligand oxygen
2px/2py π-orbitals
and the copper 3d electron shell and the 757 nm d–d transition
are largely Laporte forbidden, but d–p mixing helps in relaxing
Laporte rules, giving the observed spectra.30 These results are in agreement with the accounts in the literature
of significant overlap between the π-system (β-carbonyl/C=C)
of similar-structured 1,3-, 1,3,5-β-keto acid, β-diketone,
and α-hydroxy carboxylic acid ligands with copper or transition-metal
orbitals.7,31−35 Nonlinear fits to determine pKa in the 14 mM solution returned values of pK[Cu(H2A)] = 3.88 ± 0.02 at 400 nm and pK[Cu(H2A)] = 3.85 ± 0.02 at 757 nm (see Figure 1c). In the 1.4 mM solution,
nonlinear fits revealed pKa values of
pK[Cu(HA)] = 4.78 ± 0.03 at 400 nm
and pK[Cu(HA)] = 4.71 ± 0.05 at 757
nm (see Figure 1d).
The reason for obtaining different pKa values by switching the concentration 14 versus 1.4 mM may be due
to changes in the concentration of free and complexed ligands in solution
brought about by underlying equilibria and pH effects. The first step
in copper catalysis at acidic pH is “ketonic” complex
formation, [CuII(H2Acdica)keto]1+, with pK[CuH2A]]ave = 3.865
associated with ionization of the α-carbon CH2 group
to form an unstable metal-enolate {[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} (shown in Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Newly Proposed Equilbria for (Acetonedicarboxylato)copper Solutions
Associated with pH Values Close to pK[Cu(H2A)]
The metal-enolate species can
undergo fast protonation to form
a metal-enol, [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+, which is far more stable at acidic pH than the metal-enolate.
At pH 3.5, H+ concentrations of the 1.4 and 14 mM (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
solutions are 4.4 and 44 times higher than [H+] = 3.14
× 10–4 M and increase to 14 and 140 times at
pH 4.0 ([H+] = 1.0 × 10–4 M), respectively.
At similar or comparable concentrations of [Cu(HxAcdica)] and [H+], it is possible that protonated
species H2Acdica1–(enol) and
H2Acdica1–(keto) will be preferred
over copper complexes. Evidence of this could be found in Larson and
Lister, where at pH below pKCuA(1968) =
3.81 (pK[Cu(H2A)] in this study), rates
of decarboxylation in (acetonedicarboxylato)copper solutions were
only 20% higher than those in acetonedicarboxylate solutions without
copper, indicating a marginal increase in reactivity.27 Competition between H+ and CuII ions
for ligands and catalyzed enolization reactions at acidic pH has also
been found in studies on oxalacetate, 2-oxalopropionic acid, and acetylacetone
metal-enol(ate)s.2−5,7,37 An
inflection point over the pH range 3.0–4.0 of the pH-dependent
bell-shaped copper-catalyzed decarboxylation rate constant profile
in Hay and Leong happened to coincide with pK[Cu(H2A)], which falls between those two pH values. This inflection
point may therefore provide a previously overlooked hint toward the
underlying reaction mechanism. The location of the C=C bond
in {[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} (Scheme 3) would assist the drive for
the electron shift needed to induce decarboxylation at the terminal
carboxylic group. The formation of the C=C bond outside the
six-membered ring transition state in {[Cu(n–1)(HAcdica)enolate]} would lead to a “kinetic
enolate” effect as opposed to a “thermodynamic enolate”
effect with a C=C bond inside the six-membered ring (Scheme 4).36

Scheme 4 Proposed Decarboxylation Active Species Associated
with kCuA
Invoking this knowledge
may help in explaining why the kCuA decarboxylation
rate constant (201 ×
10–3 min–1) is 36 times faster
than the estimated rate constant for kCuL (5.6 × 10–3 min–1).27 This would make unstable {[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} associated with pK[Cu(H2A)] and subsequent {[Cu(n–1)(HAcdica)enolate]} responsible for decarboxylation.

At a lower
metal/complex concentration (1.4 mM), protonated species
H2Acdica1–(enol), H2Acdica1–(keto), and HAcdica2–(keto) are favored over {[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} and [Cu(H2Acdica)enol]1+. At pH beyond ligand pKa2 =
4.27, the HAcdica2–(keto) concentration
increases, allowing the formation of a ketonic [CuII(HAcdica)keto]0 species (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Newly Proposed Equilbria for (Acetonedicarboxylato)copper
Solutions
Associated with pH Values Close to pK[Cu(HA)] and pK[Cu(A)]
The [CuII(HAcdica)keto]0 species
undergoes deprotonation at α-carbon (pK[Cu(HA)]) to form unstable metal-enolate {[CuII(Acdica)enolate]} (Scheme 5), which can be protonated at the β-carbonyl oxygen
to form metal-enol [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the ionized carboxylic group
of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 may help
in stabilizing the enolic proton in a configuration that still allows
charge transfer from the oxygen to the copper center to initiate catalysis
(Scheme 6).38

Scheme 6 Proposed Decarboxylation Active Species
Associated with kCuL
At pH range 6.0–7.0, the H+ concentration is
low and deprotonation of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 becomes favorable. This manifest itself as pK[Cu(A)] between [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 and [CuII(Acdica)enolate]1– and is supported by the ability of Yerhoff and Larson
to isolate a NaCuL·2H2O species. The
possible explanations why previous studies may not have found pK[Cu(HA)] are as follows: the higher concentrations
employed, use of different analytical methods, and the presence of
acetate/chloroacetate buffers, which could interact with (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
complexes.26,27

At 0.1 mM concentration
of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper, we could
examine the UV range during titrations in considerable detail (see Figure 2). The spectral titration
spanned from pH 1.5 to 7.25 and had three bands of interest. We assigned
the main band at 246 nm (6970 M–1 cm–1) to the π → π* transition of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 based on the molar absorbance
of roughly the same order of magnitude as that of the acetonedicarboxylate
enol in 95% EtOH (2713 M–1 cm–1).26 The lowering of energy between wavelengths
242 nm (41 322.3 cm–1) and 246 nm (40 650.4
cm–1) implies increased stabilization of the copper-enol(ate)
complexes compared to that of the free acetonedicarboxylate enol and
[CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+.

Figure 2 UV–visible spectral titration of the (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
solution at different pHs: (a) [(acetonedicarboxylato)copper] = 0.1
mM, μ = 0.01 M (NaCl), and temperature = 25 °C and (b)
spectral titration data points at 246 nm with nonlinear curve fitting
between pH 3.0 and 7.0 to determine pK[Cu(A)].

We associate the 242 nm band shown
in the inset of Figure 2a with the π →
π* transition of H2Acdica1–(enol) and [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+, which may occur together in (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
solutions. An isosbestic point (Ip1) at pH 4.25 separates the 242 nm band associated with H2Acdica1–(enol) and [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ from the broad
246 nm band associated with the [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 complex. Nonlinear fits to absorbance data at 246 nm
(Figure 2b) returned
pK[Cu(A)] = 6.23 ± 0.04. This value
is somewhat close to the pKa value of
Cu(H2O)n2+ hydrolysis
(pKa = 6.8 at 25 °C) and was also
postulated by Hay and Leong to possibly lie somewhere between pHs
6 and 7.26,39 Instead, we associate this with deprotonation
of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 at the enolic
oxygen to form [CuII(Acdica)enolate]1– because metal-enol(ate)s can be deprotonated at the α-carbon
or β-carbonyl oxygen (Scheme 5).8 To confirm the stoichiometry
of aqueous complexes at different pHs, we used the method of continuous
variation (Figures S6 and S7). At pHs 4.8
and 5.5, data points were symmetric with a peak at χ = 0.5,
indicating a 1:1 complex stoichiometry for the 246 nm band associated
with [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 (shown
in Figure S6b,d). Using the absorbance
at 400 nm for the continuous method of variation plots at pH values
3.6, 4.2, and 4.7, Larson and Lister showed that all exhibited a maximum
at 0.5, indicating 1:1 complexes.27 Following
suit, we analyzed copper-based bands 400 nm (and
757 nm) at pHs 4.0, 5.5, and 6.5 (shown in Figure S7a–c, respectively). At pH 4.0, the 757 nm band was
unsymmetrical, whereas the 400 nm absorbance had a maximum at roughly
χ = 0.5–0.6. At pH 5.5, both 400 and 757 nm had a maximum
at χ = 0.5, indicating 1:1 ligand-to-copper stoichiometry. At
pH 6.0, both 400 and 757 nm had maximum absorbance at χ = 0.5–0.6,
indicating nearly 1:1 stoichiometry (Table 1).

Copper-Catalyzed
Enolization Kinetic Rate Constant Determination
Copper-catalyzed
enolization is generally presumed to be greatly
favored over the reverse ketonization rate constants, with the exception
of acidic pH where the H+ concentration is high enough
to compete with CuII ions for ligand coordination.37 At [CuII(HxAcdica)] ≫ [H+], [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ formation is favored (eq 1) and is supported by our
ability to determining pK[CuH2A] only in the 14 mM solution (Figure 1a,c). 1  But
when [CuII(HxAcdica)] ≤
[H+], ketonic complex [CuII(H2Acdica)keto]1+ and protonated
species are favored, which allowed the detection of the second (pK[Cu(HA)]) (Figure 1b,d) and subsequent formation of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 through enolization
of [CuII(HAcdica)keto]0. This is
illustrated below in eqs 2–4. 2   3   4  where kE3 and kE4 are the
enolization
rate constants and kK3 and kK4 are the ketonization rate constants.
The forward rate constants (kE3 and kE4) include intermediate
steps of α-carbon deprotonation, metal-enolate formation, and
finally protonation at the β-carbonyl oxygen (Schemes 3 and 5). The equilibria involving CuII may be related to the
log KCuA = 2.049 stability constant determined
by Larson and Lister. To determine forward copper-catalyzed enolization
rate constants, we conducted stopped-flow kinetics experiments in
acetate-buffered solutions (pHs 3.50, 4.40, 4.97, and 5.50) and monitored
UV absorbance changes at either 242 or 246 nm. Stopped-flow kinetic
traces at pH 3.50 measured using 242 nm absorbance changes (not shown)
were used to try to obtain kE3 for the enolization reaction, CuII + H2Acdica1–(keto) “[CuII(H2Acdica)keto]1+” = [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+, but fits to data returned
low R2 values (R2 = 0.50–0.63 with kE3 ≈ 0.05–0.07 s–1). We attributed
this to somewhat poor buffering at a lower pH and competing reactions
in eqs 2–4. Kinetic runs at pH 5.5 (shown in Figure 3) were assigned to the enolization
reaction, CuII + HAcdica2–keto “[CuII(HAcdica)enol]0”
= [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0, in which
we obtained R2 = 0.99 with kE4(ave) = 0.213 ± 0.001 s–1.

Figure 3 First-order kinetics of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 complex formation at pH 5.5. [CuII] = 0.5
mM, [acetonedicarboxylate] = 0.5 mM, μ = 0.01 M (NaCl), and
temp. = 25 °C, where kE4-1–kE4-4 represent
rate constants from four independent kinetic runs (n = 4).

The enolization rate constant
for [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 formation
was on the same order as that of
the copper-catalyzed enolization of oxaloacetate “oxac2–”, that is, [Cu(oxac)keto] ⇆
[Cu(oxac)enol] with kenol =
0.41 s–1 and ketonization kketo = 0.04 s–1.34,37kE4(ave) is 3–4 times
higher than kE3, indicating
that formation of the acidic [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ complex takes place at a significantly lower
rate than that of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0. At the 0.5 mM concentration employed in the stopped-flow experiments,
the low kE3 may represent additional
evidence in support of competition between CuII and H+ for ligands at acidic pH, as we mentioned earlier. In [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0, the enolic C=C
bond is most likely formed within the six-membered ring transition
state, as evidenced by a shift in wavelength to 246 nm and significant
increase in molar absorbance, indicating increased bond conjugation
(Schemes 5 and 6). Although we did not measure
ketonization rates (kK3 and kK4) in the current study, analysis
in a future study might be beneficial (Table 2).

Electrochemical Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
Over the −0.6
to +0.6 V scan range, in total there were three cathodic peaks (I = Epc1, II = Epc2, III = Epc3) and three anodic peaks (IV = Epa4, V = Epa5, VI = Epa6) corresponding to redox couples I–VI, II–V, and III–IV (see Figure 4 and Table 3). Although there are three redox couples,
the spectra are indicative of primarily two single 1e– transfers.40 The first
is redox couple I–VI (present from
pH 3.0 to 6.0/6.5), and the second is redox couple III–VI (present from pH 3.0 to 7.0). Redox couple II–V also represents a 1e– transfer but is a minor species because it appears
at pH 5.5. Redox couple I–VI had
|Ipa6/Ipa1| ≠ 1.0 and peak splitting ΔEp (Epc1–Epa6 = 0.214–0.250
V vs Ag/AgCl) larger than that of both II–V and III–IV redox couples
(Epc2–Epa5 = 0.154–0.153 V vs Ag/AgCl and Epc3–Epa4 = 0.067–0.091 V vs Ag/AgCl, respectively)
(shown in Table S1).

d Eo′
was calculated only at pHs 3.5 and 4.0 because these had |Ipa4/Ipc3| ≈ 1.0 (see Table S1) for data.

The large difference
in size between I and VI suggests that reduction
in I may be associated with
an electron transfer from the acetonedicarboxylate ligand to the copper
center, resulting in decarboxylation and consequently an “irreversible”
reaction. Plotting the current of I (Epc1) as a function of pH yielded a curve similar
to UV–visible spectral titration curves with a large ∼30
μA drop in current between pHs 4.0 and 4.5 (Figure S8a). Below that pH range, the complexes in the solution
are [CuII(H2Acdica)keto]1+ and [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ (Scheme 3). Although
Hay and Leong proposed that a “keto” complex (e.g.,
[CuL(H2O)2]1– as shown in Scheme 2) was responsible
for the large increase in rate constant for copper-catalyzed decarboxylation
of acetonedicarboxylate and has been supported by oxaloacetate studies
pointing toward a highly reactive acidic keto complex, we propose
instead that unstable {[Cu(n–1)(HAcdica)enolate]} (Scheme 4) provides the additional “push” for
catalysis.8,26 On the basis of this and information in Scheme 3, the reduction I and oxidation VI peaks of redox couple I–VI can be represented as eqs 5 and 6, respectively 5   6  The pH behavior of redox couple III–IV helped considerably in the assignment of
the reaction associated with the second 1e– copper center reduction. Peak splitting, ΔEp (Epc3–Epa4 = 0.067–0.091 V vs Ag/AgCl),
was the smallest compared to that for redox couples I–VI and II–V. We also noticed that redox couple III–IV is reversible only at a very limited pH range. At pHs 3.5
and 4.0, |Ipa4/Ipa3| = 1.027 and 1.076 but decreased to 0.640,
0.591, 0.422, 0.362, and 0.362 at pHs 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5,
respectively (see Table S1). With |Ipa4/Ipa3| ≈ 1.0 at pHs 3.5 and 4.0, we could calculate
the formal reduction potential, Eo′,
as 0.353 and 0.351 V versus SHE, respectively (see Table 3). Because pK[Cu(H2A)] is in very close proximity to this pH range,
it is highly likely that the reversible 1e– transfer of III–IV at acidic pH
(3.5–4.0) may be associated with interconversion between [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ and [[CuI(HAcdica)enolate]]‡. The current
of anodic peak IV (Ipa4) plotted as a function of pH exhibited an approximate inflection
point at pH ∼4.75 (shown in Figure S8b). To explain the proximity to pK[Cu(HA)] and departure from unity (|Ipa4/Ipa3| ≠ 1) at
increasing pH, we return to Schemes 5 and 6 where deprotonation at α-carbon CH2 in [CuII(HAcdica)keto]0 prior to ring closure
in {[CuII(Acdica)enolate]} shows that electron
density can be shifted from the β-carbonyl oxygen onto the copper
center. This similar type shift in electron density from the ionized
α-carbon “CH2” group in (pentane-2,4-dione)copper
allowed the copper center to act as an electron sink.2,5,22,41 A similar phenomenon was found in 23 aliphatic/aromatic substituted
1,3-diketo copper chelates, but they had mostly negative potentials
+0.038 to −0.687 V versus SCE (+0.238 to −0.487 V vs
SHE) in comparison to those for III (+0.401 to +0.377 V vs SHE) found in our
study (Table 3).42 Even though acetonedicarboxylate has two carboxylic
groups that are moderately electron-withdrawing, the high favorability
of CuII coordination to RCOO– may help
in neutralizing this effect.43 A reduction
potential higher than standard reduction potentials of CuII → CuI (+0.153) and CuII → Cu0 (+0.337)
indicates the favorability of the copper center in III–IV as an electron acceptor.44 On the basis of the aforementioned data, “reversibility”
in III–IV can be shown as eq 7, whereas “irreversibility”
in III and IV at a higher pH is shown in eqs 8 and 9 below:

“kE4” leading
to [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 formation
is finished on the order of s–1 (see Figure 3) while
the decarboxylation reaction is on the order of min–1. To confirm [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 instability, we monitored the absorbance of 246 nm of a 0.11 mM
solution of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper as a function of time at
pH 7.0 (shown in Figure S5). Although formation
of {[CuII(Acdica)enolate]} is possible over
the 4.5–7.0 pH range, formation of protonated metal-enol [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 is significantly more
favorable due to the increased stability imbued through β-carbonyl/terminal
COO– group hydrogen bonding or hydrogen bonding
with solvent H2O (Scheme 5). To make an assignment for the II–V redox couple, we once again relied on a plot of V (Ipa5) current as a function
of pH (Figure S8), which showed a sigmoid
curve with midpoint between pHs 6.0 and 6.5, which would be in direct
accordance with the pK[Cu(A)] value from
UV–visible spectral titrations. The II–V redox couple appeared at pH 5.5, and by pH 7.0, I–III are almost completely gone, with V increasing in current from pH
5.5 to 7.0, indicating only reoxidation (Figure 4 inset) of the copper center. To explain
the irreversibility of II–V, II can be associated with the formation of an aqueous and
solid hydrolyzed metal-enolate most likely similar in structure to
the NaCuL·2H2O solid isolated by Yerhoff and Larson,
which may aggregate as a metal-bridged polymer (Scheme 2). This is shown below in eqs 10 and 11 10   11  

Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance (EPR) Spectra of (Acetonedicarboxylato)copper
Low-temperature
(100 K) EPR X-band scans were conducted at pHs
4.0, 4.5, 4.75, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 (shown in Figure 5). The four-peak hyperfine splitting corresponded
to the magnetic moment between 63/65Cu isotopes with I = 3/2 and spin of CuII 3d9 (S = 1/2).

Figure 5 X-band EPR spectra of 1.0 mM (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
and 10%
v/v glycerol solution at different pHs. X-band ∼9.437 GHz,
module frequency = 100 kHz, power = 10.02 mW, μ = 0.01 M (NaCl),
and temperature = 100 K.

The spectra exhibited normal anisotropy with g|| > g⊥ > 2.0023,
indicating
a 3dx2–y2 ground state (Table 4) implying an elongated octahedral, square pyramidal
or square-planar geometry.46 On the basis
of the isolated compound, NaCuL·2H2O, where L = C5H3O5, we could infer some information
about the coordination structure.6,27 A hydration
number of 2 would most likely agree with a square-planar structure,
that is, copper-coordinated to the β-carbonyl oxygen, carboxylate
group oxygen, and neutral H2O ligands opposite to the other
coordinating oxygen atoms on the x–y plane (i.e., a [Cu(Acdica)(H2O)2]1– complex). In the EPR spectra of copper-citrate,
Malmstrom and Vangaard assigned a CuO2 chromophore with two oxygens on the xy plane
based on g|| = 2.349 and g⊥ = 2.074 to a d–d band at 13 700
cm–1, whereas in the work of Dunhill and Vangaard
(g|| = 2.37 and g⊥ = 2.07), copper-citrate was assigned a distorted octahedral geometry.47,48 The g-factors
of g|| ≈ 2.403 and g⊥ ≈ 2.077 (Table 4) and the d–d transition of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
(13 210 cm–1) are close to these values,
so binding to at least two oxygens on the xy plane
is a reasonable assignment. However, solvent H2O could
presumably take the remaining coordinating positions on the xy and z axes, which may lead to an overall
distorted octahedral geometry in solution. To further confirm either
a CuO2 or CuO4 chromophore with (acetonedicarboxylato)copper,
we converted A|| to mK to compare with
that from Peisach and Blumberg.49 Converted A|| values
were 11.36, 11.15, 10.94, 11.44, and 11.71 at pHs 4.0, 4.5, 4.75,
5.5, and 6.0, respectively, and fell at the lower range of ∼12
mK for nonblue type 2 copper complexes with a CuO4 chromophore. The parallel hyperfine splitting
(A||) of type 2 copper complexes is also
known to resemble aqueous copper ions, that is, [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (124 × 10–4 and/or 127
× 10–4 cm–1).50−52 At pHs 4.0, 5.5, and 6.0, parallel hyperfine splitting values were
very close with 121.48 × 10–4, 122.38 ×
10–4, and 125.30 × 10–4 cm–1, respectively. The decrease at pHs 4.50 and 4.75
to 119.30 × 10–4 and 117.05 × 10–4 cm–1 is close to pK[Cu(HA)] and may indicate a change in the copper coordination sphere. Assuming
the CuO4 square-planar chromophore,
the ratio g||/A|| indicates the amount of tetrahedral distortion in square-planar
complexes, with very low distortion at 105–135 cm and increasing
distortion at 220–700 cm.53 The
values at pHs 4.50 (215.44 cm) and 4.75 (219.63 cm) fall closest to
this range, thus indicating significant tetrahedral distortion. The
metal-enol complexes of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper start in the
CuII oxidation state, but CuIIL-type complexes
can undergo tetrahedral distortion to approximate the preferential
geometry of aqueous CuI and metastable CuIL
type complexes, which are not as constrained by specific geometric
coordination modes.54 As the pH is increased
to 7.0, the four hyperfine splitting peaks become undetectable and
the EPR spectral intensity decreases, indicating the formation of
an “EPR-silent” species at pH 7.0 (see Figure 5). The presence of the d–d
transition (757 nm) at pH 7.0 would seem directly in opposition to
the EPR spectra because diamagnetic (3d10) species would
be colorless over the visible wavelength range. However, the disappearance
of CV “reduction” peaks I–III at pH 7.0 leaving only the anodic “oxidation”
peak V (Figure 4) indicates that unstable [CuI(Acdica)enolate]1– (aq) is easily reoxidized to [CuII(Acdica)enolate]1– (aq), which is more
stable in aqueous solution (eqs 10 and 11). On the basis of these
findings, actual reasoning for the broadening and loss of hyperfine
structure in frozen glassy state may therefore be due to exchange
between the paramagnetic and diamagnetic species in aqueous solution.55 This paramagnetic/diamagnetic copper center
exchange might also explain the reasoning behind the metal-bridged
polymer solid structure (Scheme 2) proposed by Yerhoff and Larson because a metal-bridged
polymer might have copper in both CuII and CuI oxidation states. To obtain additional information on the covalency
or ionic nature of in-plane σ-bonds and out-of-plane π-bonding,
we calculated corresponding α2 and β2 values, respectively, where unity means primarily ionic σ-bonding
or π-bonding and α2 or β2 =
0.5 corresponds to primarily covalent bonding.56,57 For calculation of α2, we used eq 12 12  where α2 is the covalency
of in-plane σ-bonds. Parameters A||, g||, and g⊥ are taken from Table 4; “ge” is the free electron
value (ge = 2.0023) and “P” is the dipolar interaction term (0.0360 cm–1).56 To calculate β2, we employed eq 13, which can be rewritten as eq 14 13   14  where β2 is the covalency
of out-of-plane π-bonds. Parameters g|| and α2 were taken from Table 4, ge is the value
for the free electron, and λ is the spin-orbit coupling constant
of free copper (828 cm–1). Finally, ΔE is the crystal field splitting energy in cm–1 for the d–d transition at 757 nm (i.e., 13  210.04
cm–1). At pHs 4.0, 4.5, 4.75, 5.5, and 6.0, α2 = 0.78–0.80, which is roughly halfway between unity
and 0.5, indicating that there is significant covalency in the Cu–O
in-plane σ-bonds on the x–y axis and in the range similar to that for other oxygen-bonded copper
carboxylic complexes in the literature. For the β2 values, out-of plane π-bonding is strictly ionic (β2 = 1.00–1.03).

Conclusions
In this study, we employed UV–visible spectra and spectral
titrations, stopped-flow kinetics, CV, and EPR to uncover new important
details on the aqueous metal-enol(ate)s associated with the copper-catalyzed
decarboxylation of acetonedicarboxylate. Spectral titrations revealed
pK[Cu(H2A)] and pK[Cu(HA)] (ionization of β-carbonyl adjacent αCH2 groups) and pK[Cu(A)] (enol “OH”
ionization in [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 to form metastable {[CuII(Acdica)enolate]}).
Ionization in pK[Cu(H2A)] and pK[Cu(HA)] is followed by a shift in electron
density to the β-carbonyl oxygen, forming unstable metal-enolates,
{[CuII(HAcdica)enolate]} and {[CuII(Acdica)enolate]}. The unstable metal-enolates can proceed decarboxylation
(through CuII acting as a catalytic electron sink prior
to the decarboxylation step) but can also form metal-enols [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ and [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0. Preliminary results
monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 246 nm (associated with [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0) at pH 7.0 at various
times (Figure S5) suggest that this wavelength can be used to monitor “decarboxylation”
in this complex. Not only does this permit access to experimentally
determined decarboxylation rate constants in the near future for the
metal-enol but would prove “kCuL” estimated through calculation by Larson and Lister. Metal-enolates
[CuII(Acdica)enolate]1– and
[CuI(Acdica)enolate]1– associated
with redox couple II–V had significantly
lower potentials than those of the metal-enol species [CuII(H2Acdica)enol]1+ and [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 associated with III–IV, indicating higher favorability of copper
center reduction through metal-enols instead of metal-enolates. This
finding differs significantly from previous studies on (oxalacetato)copper
metal-enol(ate)s, where authors considered metal-enols to be inactive;
could this be related to the six-membered intramolecular hydrogen-bonded
structure of [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0 versus a possible five-membered structure in (oxalacetato)copper
or some other mechanism? Despite electron transfers (CV) and the coordination
geometry of the copper center (EPR) in β-keto carboxylic acid
complexes, playing an important role in these reactions, surprisingly
few studies have compared/contrasted these properties. Therefore,
future metal-enol(ate) studies may choose to include CV and EPR analysis.
Follow-up studies on acetonedicarboxylic acid may focus on obtaining
enol/enolate pKa values and enolization
and ketonization rates, as well as confirmation of pKa’s from this study using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Having access to other acetonedicarboxylic acid pKa’s would also allow researchers to gauge
by just how much copper coordination reduced the original ligand α-carbon
pKa values.

Experimental and Analytical
Methods
Chemicals
Acetonedicarboxylic acid (purity >95%)
was
purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. CuCl2·2H2O, glacial acetic acid, sodium acetate, NaOH, HCl, and NaCl
were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Beijing.
All reagents were of analytical grade, and Millipore Milli-Q water
was used in all experiments. The pH in all experiments was monitored
using an Orion 3-STAR pH meter with Gel pH electrode (Thermo Scientific)
and calibrated using NIST pH standards (pHs 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0). To
minimize decarboxylation of stock solutions through nonmetal-catalyzed
reactions, each set of experiments required freshly prepared stock
solutions of acetonedicarboxylic acid; (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
refers to a 1:1 molar ratio of [CuII]/[acetonedicarboxylate].

UV–Visible Spectra and Spectral Titrations
The
low-concentration spectra (0.1 mM, Figure 2a) and high-concentration spectra (1.4 mM, Figure 1b and 14.0 mM, Figure 1a) were recorded by making separate
solutions (pHs 1.5–7.5, at 0.25 increments; pHs 3.0–7.5
for 14 mM) with the same concentration of μ = 0.01 M (NaCl).
Milli-Q water was N2-gas-sparged 2 h prior to experiments,
which was continued
during pH adjustment and dilution to the final volume of 45 mL. pH
was adjusted using 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH (0.1 and 1.4 mM solutions),
and 0.5 M NaOH (14 mM solution). Aliquots were removed from centrifuge
tubes and placed into a 1 cm quartz cuvette for analysis using a Hitachi
dual-beam U-3010 UV-spectrophotometer (Hitachi High-Technologies Co.,
Japan). The path length was 10 mm, and slit width was 2 nm at a wavelength
scan rate of 600 nm min–1 from 190 to 900 nm. UV–visible
batch titration spectral pKa’s
were estimated by nonlinear least-squares regression using the Henderson–Hesselbalch
equation, eq 15, and
fit to experimental data using the reconfigured form shown in eq 16 in the nonlinear fitting
module of Origin 8.5. 15   16  where Aobs is
the curve fit-calculated observed absorbance at wavelength X, Abase is the absorbance at
basic pH, Aacid is the absorbance at acidic
pH, and A1 is the absorbance of points
near the pKa to be determined.58

Stopped-Flow Kinetic Experiments
Briefly, 50 mL centrifuge
tubes were filled with solutions of 0.5 copper or 0.5 mM 3-oxopentanedioate
followed by addition of acetate buffer (total concentration was [CH3COOH] + [CH3COO–Na+] = 50 mM) with subsequent pH adjustment (pHs 3.50, 4.40, 4.97, and
5.50) and dilution to a final volume of 50 mL. μ = 0.01 M (NaCl)
was used as a background ionic strength, and temperature was 25 °C.
Copper solution and acetonedicarboxylate solutions were withdrawn
using 5 mL syringes and placed at the drive syringe locations of an
Applied Photophysics Ltd. SX20 stopped-flow reaction analyzer. Contents
were mixed using a 1:1 ratio, and the UV absorbance was measured at
either 242 nm (pH 3.50) or 246 nm (pHs 4.40, 4.97, and 5.50) with
15 s monitoring time and collection of 1000 data points per run. Because
246 nm is correlated with [CuII(HAcdica)enol]0, we could assume a first-order reaction in which the
change in absorbance as a function of time is proportional to that
species. For first-order kinetic fittings, we employed the “ExpDecay1”
module in Origin 8.5 to determine enolization rate constants kE3 and kE4.

CV Experiments
Solutions of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
(1.0 mM) were prepared by adding aliquots of copper and acetondicarboxylate
to 50 mL polyethylene centrifuge tubes with 0.1 M NaCl as an electrolyte.
During dilution to the final volume of 45 mL, we adjusted the pH (3.0,
3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0) using 0.1 M HCl or NaOH. Milli-Q
water for stock solutions and experimental solutions was sparged with
N2 gas for 2 h prior to experiments and during pH adjustment
to remove dissolved oxygen. The 50 mL glass beaker used in CV experiments
was left open to the laboratory atmosphere. Electrochemical measurements
were conducted using CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation (CH Instruments,
Inc.; Shanghai, China). CV scans employed a three-electrode system
of a 3 mm GC working electrode (0.07 cm2), a platinum auxillary
electrode, and a (3 mol KCl) Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Using NaCl
electrolyte concentration of ≥0.1 M with copper complexes,
we compared our CV peaks to the standard potential for CuCl(s) formation, E° = +0.538 V versus normal hydrogen electrode to ensure
no interference.30

EPR Experiments
Solutions of (acetonedicarboxylato)copper
(1.0 mM) were prepared by adding aliquots of copper and acetonedicarboxylate
to 50 mL centrifuge tubes with μ = 0.01 M (NaCl). During dilution
to the final volume of 45 mL, we adjusted the pH (4.00, 4.50, 4.75,
5.50, 6.00, and 7.00) using 0.1 M HCl or NaOH and added glycerol (10%
v/v) as a glassing agent. Control experiments at 100 K without glycerol
and at 298 K are shown in Figures S9 and S10. Samples were withdrawn and placed into standard 3 mm quartz tubes
for EPR analysis. For analysis, we employed a Bruker EMXplus-10/12
EPR spectrometer at X-band (9.437 ± 0.008 GHz) and 100 K temperature
controlled using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled sample cavity. Instrument
settings were as follows: power = 10.02 mW, center field = 3100 G,
sweep width = 2600 G, receiver gain = 2.52 × 104,
module frequency = 100 kHz, module amplitude = 1.0 G, time constant
= 327.68 ms, conversion time = 60 ms, and sweep time = 61.44 s. The g-tensors (g|| and g⊥) were calculated as the average between +1/2
and −1/2 hyperfine splitting peaks of the derivative spectra
and the largest peak in the integrated EPR spectra, respectively.
The parallel hyperfine splitting constant (A||) was determined by taking the difference between −3/2
and −1/2 peaks, as indicated in the inset of Figure 5.
