We have combined
results from several spectroscopic techniques
to investigate the aerobic reactions of Rh2(AcO)4 (AcO– = CH3COO–)
with l-cysteine (H2Cys) and its derivatives d-penicillamine (3,3′-dimethylcysteine, H2Pen), with steric hindrance at the thiol group, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (H2NAC), with its amino group
blocked. Previous investigations have shown that antitumor active
dirhodium(II) carboxylates may irreversibly inhibit enzymes containing
a thiol group at or near their active sites. Also, cysteine, the only
thiol-containing proteinogenic amino acid, interacts in vivo with
this class of antitumor compounds, but structural information on the
products of such reactions is lacking. In the present study, the reactions
of Rh2(AcO)4 and H2L were carried
out in aqueous solutions at the pH of mixing (acidic) and at physiological
pH, using the different mole ratios 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6, which resulted
in the same products in increasing yields. Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) indicates formation of dimeric [RhIII2Pen4]2– or oligomeric
{RhIII2L4}n (L = Cys, NAC) complexes with bridging thiolate groups. Analyses
of Rh K edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data
reveal 3–4 Rh–S and 2–3 Rh–(N/O) bonds
around six-coordinated Rh(III) ions at mean distances of 2.33 ±
0.02 and 2.09 ± 0.02 Å, respectively. In the N-acetyl-l-cysteine compound, the RhIII···RhIII distance 3.10 ± 0.02 Å obtained from the EXAFS
spectrum supports trithiolate bridges between the Rh(III) ions, as
was also found when using glutathione as ligand. In the cysteine and
penicillamine complexes, double thiolate bridges join the Rh(III)
ions, with the nonbridging Cys2– and Pen2– ligands in tridentate chelating (S,N,O) mode, which is consistent
with the ΔδC = 7.3–8.4 ppm shift of
the COO– signal in their carbon-13 cross polarization
magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectra. For the penicillamine complex,
the 2475.6 eV peak in its S K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES) spectrum shows partial oxidation, probably caused by peroxide
generated from reduction of dissolved O2, of thiolato to
sulfenato (S=O) groups, which were also identified by ESI-MS
for all three {RhIII2L4}n compounds.

Introduction
The antitumor activity
of neutral dirhodium(II) complexes with
bridging carboxylate groups in a cage structure, Rh2(μ-RCOO)4 (R = CH3, C2H5, and C3H7), was initially reported in 1972 by Bear and
co-workers.1−3 They observed that the survival time of mice bearing
Ehrlich ascites or leukemia L1210 tumors increased when they were
treated with dirhodium(II) carboxylates. The treatment was also effective
against leukemia P388 and sarcoma 180 tumors. This class of compounds
could inhibit in vivo DNA synthesis of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells,
and in vitro DNA and RNA polymerase from Escherichia
coli.4−6 The metabolism of dirhodium(II) tetraacetate was
explored by injecting 14C-labeled Rh2(AcO)4 in tumor-bearing Swiss mice, which exhaled 14CO2 within 2 h after injection, indicating breakdown of the cage
structure into carboxylate and rhodium ions. The rhodium was mainly
deposited in the liver, with only ∼5% excreted through urine
within the first 24 h after administrating the drug.7 A similar structural breakdown was observed when reacting
dirhodium(II) tetraacetate (1, Rh2(AcO)4) with cysteine in the mole ratio 1:4 at pH = 7.5, which resulted
in an insoluble Rh(III)–cysteine complex, protons, and free
acetate groups.7,8 In vitro studies showed that human
serum albumin maintained the cage structure of Rh2(AcO)4 by binding to its axial positions via the N-imidazole moieties of its histidine residues.9 Although enzymes containing thiol (−SH) groups at
or near their active site were irreversibly inhibited by dirhodium(II)
carboxylates, other enzymes without free −SH groups, or those
containing thiol groups away from their active site, were not affected.8,10 Inhibition was proposed to involve reactions of protein–thiol
groups with dirhodium(II) carboxylates, leading to breakdown of their
cage structure, oxidation of Rh(II), and tight binding of Rh(III)
ions to the active site of those enzymes. The results were then correlated
to the limited excretion of rhodium from mice treated with dirhodium(II)
tetraacetate, indicating that rhodium probably binds to thiol-containing
proteins at the cell membrane.7,8 Bear et al. suggested
that the antitumor efficiency of this class of dirhodium(II) carboxylate
compounds could be enhanced by increasing their resistance toward
reaction with −SH groups, for example, by blocking the axial
positions (assumed as the initial −SH coordination sites) with
stronger ligands such as polyadenylic acid.11 They also proposed that as a detoxification step after administering
a large dose of a dirhodium(II) carboxylate drug, treatment with a
nontoxic thiol-containing molecule such as glutathione should be considered.11

In 1980, Pneumatikakis and Psaroulis reported
the reactions of
[Rh2(AcO)4(CH3OH)2] with
cysteine, penicillamine, or cysteine methylester (1:4 mole ratio),
which produced precipitates characterized as mononuclear paramagnetic
square-planar Rh(II) complexes with (S,N)-coordinated ligands.12

Two decades later, the reactions of [Rh2(AcO)2(N–N)2(CH3CN)2]X2 {N–N = 1,10-phenantroline (phen) or
2,2′-bipyridine
(bpy), 2; X = PF6 or BF4, respectively},
among other Rh complexes,13 were investigated
with 2-aminothiophenol (at mole ratios of 1:10 and 1:4) under aerobic
conditions as models for how antitumor active dirhodium(II) bis-polypyridine
compounds react with thiol-containing biomolecules. Reaction products
included mononuclear [RhIII(S,N-C6H6NS)(S-C6H6NS)2(phen)] or binuclear [RhIII(μ-S,N-C6H6NS)(η1-S-C6H6NS)(bpy)]22+ (3a) with
mononuclear [RhIII(S,N-C6H6NS)2(bpy)]+ (3b) cocrystallized in the same unit cell (Scheme 1).14 With excess sodium benzene-thiolate (Na+C6H5S–) in dry degassed methanol, the
bipyridine complex 2 generated the dark red binuclear
[RhII(μ-S-C6H5S)(η1-S-C6H5S)(bpy)]2·CH3OH crystalline complex (3′) with two bridging and two terminal thiolates.15 This complex was considered as a model for a
reactive intermediate that, in the presence of oxygen, could produce
Rh(III) species that were similar to those formed with 2-aminothiophenol.14 Dark blue precipitates were obtained by reacting 2 with cysteine and glutathione (at a mole ratio of 1:4) under
anaerobic conditions, but these were not structurally characterized.15

Scheme 1 Structures of [RhII2(AcO)4] (1), [RhII2(AcO)2(bpy)2(CH3CN)2]2+ (2), and Its Reaction Products with Thiolates:
[RhII(μ-S-C6H5S)(η1-S-C6H5S)(bpy)]2 (3′), [RhIII(μ-S,N-C6H6NS)(η1-S-C6H6NS)(bpy)]22+ (3a), and [RhIII(S,N-C6H6NS)2(bpy)]+ (3b) Reported in Refs (13−15)
Here, we report the results of our characterization of
the reaction
products from Rh2(AcO)4 (1) and
the thiol-containing amino acids l-cysteine (H2Cys), d-penicillamine (3,3′-dimethylcysteine, H2Pen), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (H2NAC), using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS),
solid state carbon-13 cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS)
NMR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The choice of these
biologically relevant ligands was based on their potential to form
S,N-chelates (H2Cys and H2Pen), or to act solely
as a monodentate thiol ligand (H2NAC). Moreover, penicillamine
probes the influence of increased steric hindrance in the vicinity
of the thiol group. The results reveal the nature and structure of
the decomposition products that were previously reported but not identified,7,8 and increase our understanding of the fate of dirhodium(II) carboxylates
in vivo in the presence of thiol-containing proteins and enzymes.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
l-Cysteine, d-penicillamine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and sodium hydroxide were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and dirhodium(II) tetraacetate (pure;
47% Rh) was obtained from Pressure Chemical Company; all were used
without further purification. Degassed water and D2O were
prepared by bubbling argon through boiled distilled water or D2O for 3 h until they had cooled down to room temperature.
Sephadex G-15 was obtained from VWR International.

A calibrated
Thermo Scientific Orion Star semi-micro electrode was used for pH
measurements. Thermogravimetry (TG), to measure water content, was
carried out using a Netzsch STA 409 instrument, and a Johnson Matthey
magnetic susceptibility balance was used to analyze the magnetic properties
of the solid samples.

Solid {Rh2III(HCys)2(Cys)2·4H2O}n (4)
To a completely dissolved solution
of dirhodium(II)
tetraacetate (0.1123 g, 0.254 mmol) in 40 mL of oxygen-free water,
solid cysteine (0.1234 g, 1.018 mmol) was added under a stream of
argon to prevent oxidation of the ligand to cystine. The solution
color gradually changed from emerald green to orange-brown and a precipitate
was formed (pH = 3.2). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature
under aerobic conditions. The precipitate was filtered, washed with
methanol and ether several times and dried under vacuum in a desiccator.
Elemental analysis: calcd for {Rh2III(HCys)2(Cys)2·4H2O}n, (Rh2C12H30O12S4N4): %C 19.05, %H 4.00, %N 7.41 (9.5% H2O); found: %C 19.30, %H 4.06, %N 6.86 (TG: 9.9% H2O); yield = 91%. Magnetic susceptibility measurements showed the
solid bulk, which is insoluble in solvents, to be diamagnetic.

Aerobic
Reaction of Rh2(AcO)4 with Thiol-Containing
Ligands H2L (pH = 7.4)
An emerald green suspension
of 0.100 g (0.226 mmol) of dirhodium(II) tetraacetate in 30 mL of
degassed water was added dropwise to colorless solutions containing
one of the following H2L ligands (0.909 mmol of H2Cys, or 0.905 mmol of H2Pen, or 0.906 mmol of H2NAC) dissolved in 90 mL of degassed water. The reactions were carried
out under a stream of argon to prevent formation of disulfides by
oxidation of the ligand −SH group. When adding 1.0 M NaOH dropwise
to adjust the pH of the solutions to 7.4, their color turned to dark
red/orange. The reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature
(RT) for 2 h under argon flow, and then exposed to air for another
46 h, while regularly adjusting the pH by adding 1.0 M NaOH. ESI-mass
spectra were measured at different time intervals (30 min, 2 h, 24
h, and 48 h after pH adjustment). A rotary evaporator was used (at
RT) to reduce the volume before passing the solution through a Sephadex
G-15 size exclusion chromatography column with water as eluent. ESI-mass
spectra were measured for different parts of the orange band, which
was separated and concentrated. A portion of the concentrated solution
was set aside for extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
spectroscopic measurement, and the remaining part was evaporated to
dryness and further dried in a desiccator under vacuum. Elemental
analyses of the solid products from the three reactions are as follows:

Calcd for {Na2[Rh2(Cys)4]·5H2O}n (Rh2C12H30N4O13S4Na2) (5): %C 17.61, %H 3.69, %N 6.85
(11.00% H2O); found: %C 17.93, %H 3.69, %N 6.82 (TG: 10.57%
H2O); yield = 72%. Calcd for Na2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O (Rh2C20H45N4O14.5S4Na2) (6): %C 25.19, %H 4.76, %N 5.87
(8.50% H2O); found: %C 25.22, %H 4.72, %N 5.76 (TG: 8.12%
H2O); yield = 67%. Calcd for {Na2[Rh2(NAC)4]·4.5H2O}n (Rh2C20H37N4O16.5S4Na2) (7): %C 24.57,
%H 3.81, %N 5.73 (8.29% H2O); found: %C 24.21, %H 3.41,
%N 5.45 (TG: 7.99% H2O); yield = 76%.

These solid
samples, which were all diamagnetic and water soluble
(only partially soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and insoluble in other
common solvents), were used for 13C CPMAS NMR, ESI-MS,
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Rh K edge EXAFS, and S K edge
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic measurements.

NMR Spectroscopy
Carbon-13 cross-polarization magic
angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectra were measured for solid compounds
at room temperature using a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer with
high power proton decoupling, setting α-glycine carbonyl at
176.50 ppm as reference.16 The ground solids 1, 4–7, and the H2L compounds used as ligands were packed separately into a 4 mm zirconia
rotor spinning at an magic angle spinning rate of 12 kHz, collecting
∼100 scans with a 10 s recycle delay for each sample.

ESI-Mass
Spectrometry
An Agilent 6520 Q-ToF instrument
was used to measure ESI-mass spectra both in positive (+) and negative
(−) ion modes. Voltages for capillary, skimmer, and fragmentor
were set at 4000, 65, and 80 V, respectively. Solid samples were dissolved
in water, and methanol was used as the mobile phase with a continuous
injection flow rate of 0.2 mL min–1 and a drying
gas flow rate of 7 L min–1 at 200 °C. For voltage
variable measurements, the fragmentor voltage varied between 0 and
80 V. The nature of the mass ions and their corresponding m/z values were confirmed using the isotope
distribution calculator from Agilent, and a high resolution calculation
method chosen from Scientific Instrument Services (SIS).17

Electronic Spectroscopy
UV–vis
absorption spectra
were measured at RT using a Cary 300 UV–vis double-beam spectrophotometer.
Samples were measured in quartz cells with 1 mm path-length, using
water in the reference position.

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Data Collection
Rh K
edge EXAFS spectra of the solid {Rh2III(Cys)2(HCys)2·4H2O}n (4) precipitated at pH = 3.2, the concentrated
solutions (pH = 7.4), and corresponding solid compounds {Na2[Rh2(Cys)4]·5H2O}n (5), Na2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O (6), and {Na2[Rh2(NAC)4]·4.5H2O}n (7) were measured
at room temperature at BL 7–3 (500 mA) at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) operating under 3 GeV. Higher-order harmonics
were rejected by detuning the Si(220) (ϕ = 0°) double-crystal
monochromator to 50% of maximum intensity at the end of the Rh K edge
scan range. The X-ray energy was internally calibrated by assigning
the first inflection point of the absorption edge of a Rh foil placed
between the ion chambers I1 and I2 to 23 219.80
eV. Three ion chambers (I0, I1, and I2) were filled with nitrogen (N2). Four to ten scans were
collected for each sample in transmission mode and compared prior
to averaging to ensure that no radiation damage occurred during measurement.

S K edge XANES spectra of the solid compounds 5–7 were measured at BL 4–3 (SSRL), equipped with a Si(111)
double-crystal monochromator, a harmonic rejection mirror, and a Vortex
fluorescence detector. The solid samples were finely ground, dusted
on Mylar tape, and placed in a sample chamber filled with helium.
Two scans collected in fluorescence mode were averaged. Energy calibration
was achieved by setting the first peak maximum in the S XANES spectrum
of Na2S2O3·5H2O to
2472.02 eV.

XAS Data Analysis
The WinXAS 3.1
program18 was used for first order polynominal
pre-edge
background subtraction and normalization of the Rh K edge XAS spectra,
followed by subtraction of a seven segment cubic spline in the post-edge
region to extract the EXAFS oscillations. The first inflection point
of the absorption edges varied over a narrow range (E0 = 23 226.3–23 226.7 eV). To simulate
theoretical EXAFS oscillations, the atomic coordinates of ΔΛ-[Rh{Ir(aet)3}2]3+ (Haet = 2-aminoethanethiol) with
the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) code AQUVOX,19 were used for the ATOMS and Feff 7.0 programs,20,21 replacing Ir with Rh, as the ionic radii of Rh3+ and
Ir3+ ions are very similar (0.665 and 0.68 Å, respectively).22

Least-squares curve-fitting of the theoretically
simulated EXAFS oscillations to the experimental EXAFS spectra was
performed over the k-range ∼2.8–18.2
Å–1. The wide k-range EXAFS
data of good quality allowed simultaneous refinement of the coordination
numbers (CN), bond distances (R), and the Debye–Waller
factor parameters (σ2), unless otherwise stated.
The ΔE0 was allowed to float as
a common value for all scattering paths involved in the fitting. The
amplitude reduction factor (S02) was set at 0.92, as obtained from the EXAFS data analysis of solid
Rh2(AcO)4.23 The
accuracy of the bond distances, σ2 (mean square of
the variation around the mean distance), and refined CN values is
within ±0.02 Å, ±0.001 Å2, and ±10–15%,
respectively. The residual () from the
least-squares curve-fitting in k-space is defined
as  where yexp and ytheo denote experimental and theoretical data
points, respectively.

Results
Dirhodium(II) tetraacetate,
Rh2(AcO)4 (1), has limited solubility
in water. When a completely dissolved
aqueous solution of 1 (emerald green) is mixed with a
fourfold amount of cysteine under aerobic conditions, a red-brown
precipitate is formed after 5 min (pH = 3.2), whereas similar reactions
with N-acetylcysteine or penicillamine result in
clear emerald green solutions. When adjusting the pH to 7.4, the reactions
proceed quickly with a color change to orange-red (see Experimental Section). To monitor the early stages of the
reaction for the solutions containing N-acetylcysteine
or penicillamine, we measured, over a period of time, their ESI-MS,
UV–vis, and/or 1H NMR spectra at the pH of mixing
(acidic) at which the reaction is relatively slow. The majority of
these results are presented in Appendices 1 and 2 in the Supporting Information (Figures S-1–S-5, Tables S-1, and S-2),
including the ESI-mass spectra of pure Rh2(AcO)4 in water (Figure S-6).

The UV–vis
spectrum of a solution containing Rh2(AcO)4 and
H2NAC (C1 = 1.0
mM, mole ratio of 1:4) at the pH of mixing (2.8)
initially displayed a broad peak around 340 nm, which gradually red-shifted
with time while gaining intensity, with its highest intensity at λmax = 367 nm observed after 48 h (see Figure 1, left). ESI-mass spectra of the same UV–vis
samples showed peaks associated with [Rh2III(AcO)4(HNAC)2 ± H+]+/– (m/z = 764.90 and 766.91) and
the corresponding Na+ mass ions (+m/z = 788.90 and 810.88) as well as intense peaks assigned
to unreacted Rh2(AcO)4 (+m/z = 459.90, 464.85, and 505.88); see Figures 1 (right) and S-3, and Tables 1 and S-1. No mass peak was related to the mononuclear
Rh(III) complex. When the pH of the solution mixture was adjusted
to 7.4 after 48 h, the peak intensity at λmax = 367
nm substantially decreased within a few minutes. This peak does not
appear in the UV–vis spectra when adjusting the reaction pH
to 7.4 directly after mixing the reactants (see Figure S-7).

Reaction of Rh2(AcO)4 with Thiols at Physiological
pH
The results presented below refer to the aerobic reactions
of Rh2(AcO)4 with thiol-containing ligands (H2L) in the mole ratio of 1:4. Other mole ratios (1:2 and 1:6)
led to the same products (5–7) in
different yields (44–49 and 77–96% for mole ratios of
1:2 and 1:6, respectively); see Appendix 3 in the Supporting Information, where
an image of the size exclusion chromatography purification column
is shown for a solution containing Rh2(OAc)4 and H2NAC (mole ratio of 1:4).

ESI-Mass Spectrometry
The most intense peaks in the
ESI-mass spectra (− ion mode, fragmentor voltage 80 V) of the
products obtained from the reactions of 1 with cysteine
(5), penicillamine (6), or N-acetylcysteine (7) at pH = 7.4 were associated with
[RhIII2L4]2– ions
that had satellite peaks with (−)m/z +8 and +16; see Figure 2 and Table 2. In all mass ions, the oxidation state of the rhodium ions
is +3, except for [RhII2(NAC)3]2– (−m/z =
344.43). On the basis of the observed isotopic patterns, tri-, tetra-,
or hexanuclear mass ions were also detected, but no mononuclear rhodium
mass ion was observed in the spectra shown in Figure 2. ESI-mass spectra of reaction mixtures with
Rh2(AcO)4/H2L in a mole ratio of
1:2 showed the same mass ions, together with large peaks related to
unreacted Rh2(AcO)4 (see Appendix 3 in the Supporting Information for H2Pen reaction).

oxidized form of N-acetylcysteine with a S–S
bond.

When setting the fragmentor
voltage at 0 V, the main mass peaks
observed for the Rh–penicillamine reaction product 6 were those of [RhIII2(Pen)4 + H+]− (−m/z = 794.96), [RhIII2(Pen)4 + H+ + O]− (−m/z = 810.95), and [RhIII2(Pen)4 + H+ + 2O]− (−m/z = 826.95), indicating that the dinuclear
species dominate in 6; see Figure S-8. For the Rh–N-acetylcysteine reaction
product 7, the majority of the mass peaks at 0 V were
those of the tetranuclear RhIII4(NAC)8–10 species with an added O atom or H+/Na+ ions,
with only a few peaks detected for the dinuclear RhIII2(NAC)4 species (see Figure S-9 and Table S-3).

The lowest fragmentor voltage that
could generate mass peaks for
the Rh–cysteine reaction product 5 was 10 V; however,
no isotopic pattern could be observed (Figure S-10 and Table S-4). Similar to Rh–penicillamine 6, peaks were assigned to the dinuclear species [RhIII2(Cys)4 + H+]− (−m/z = 682.83), [RhIII2(Cys)4 + H+ + O]− (−m/z = 698.83), and [RhIII2(Cys)4 + H+ + 2O]− (−m/z = 714.81),
assuming the charge −1. In addition, two less intense peaks
were detected at (−)m/z =
803.84 and 819.85 for [RhIII2(Cys)5 + 3H+]− and [RhIII2(Cys)5 + 3H+ + O]− ions,
respectively. Because the reaction of Rh2(AcO)4 with cysteine was carried out at the mole ratio 1:4, the presence
of such a Rh/Cys 2:5 complex may indicate fragmentation of higher
complexes, for example with a Rh/Cys 4:8 ratio, as observed in the
ESI-mass spectrum measured at 80 V (see Table 2).

In summary, analyses of the ESI-mass
spectra show formation of
a dinuclear [RhIII2(Pen)4]2– complex in 6, dinuclear [RhIII2(Cys)4]2– or tetranuclear {RhIII2(Cys)42–}2 complexes
in 5, and oligomeric {RhIII2(NAC)42–}n species
in 7 (with 1–2 added O atoms), and exclude formation
of mononuclear Rh complexes.

Sulfur K Edge XANES Spectroscopy
To examine whether
the detected mass ions with 1–2 added O atoms correspond to
sulfenato (S=O) or sulfinato (O=S=O) groups,
S K edge XANES spectra of the Rh–cysteine (5),
Rh–penicillamine (6), and Rh–N-acetylcysteine (7) solid reaction products were measured.
The spectra and their corresponding smoothed second derivatives are
shown in Figure 3.
There are four distinct absorption features for 6, and
only two absorption peaks at 2472.0 and ∼2474.0 eV for 5 and 7.

Figure 3 Sulfur K edge XANES spectra (left) and the corresponding
smoothed
second derivatives (right) of the solid products obtained from the
reactions of Rh2(AcO)4 with cysteine (5), penicillamine (6), or N-acetylcysteine
(7) at a mole ratio of 1:4 at pH = 7.4.

In the spectrum of the nickel(II) cysteinate complex
with 3d8 low-spin configuration and square-planar coordination,
K2[Ni(S,N-Cys)2], the distinct pre-edge feature observed at 2471.1 eV and the main
peak at 2472.8 eV correspond to S 1s transitions to an unoccupied
frontier orbital with S 3p and Ni 3dxy character, and to a σ*(C–S) orbital, respectively.24 For the Rh–cysteine reaction product 5 with Rh(III) low-spin d6 configuration, it seems
likely that the peaks at 2472.0 and 2474.0 eV correspond to the S(1s)
→ lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (with S(3p) and
Rh(4d) character) and S(1s) → σ*(C–S) transitions,
respectively. The additional feature appearing in the spectrum of
the Rh–penicillamine reaction product 6 at 2475.6
eV (less pronounced or absent for 5 or 7) is probably due to a sulfenato (S=O) group bound to the
Rh(III) ion, that is, a SS=O (1s) → σ*
(C–SS=O) transition. The assignment is based
on the peak at 2475.9 eV in the S XANES spectrum of methionine sulfoxide.25 The low-energy shoulder at 2470.6 eV in the
spectrum of 6 can then be tentatively assigned to SS=O (1s) → LUMO (with SS=O (3p)
and Rh(4d) character).24,26

Rh K Edge EXAFS Spectroscopy
Because no single crystals
could be prepared, we used Rh K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy
to determine the local structure, that is, nature/number of the nearest
neighbors and bond distances, around the Rh(III) ions in the solid
reaction products 5–7. The k3-weighted Rh K edge EXAFS spectra and the corresponding
Fourier transforms (FTs) for the solids 5–7 are shown in Figure 4 with the least-squares curve-fitting results presented in Table 3. For comparison,
EXAFS data for a concentrated solution of the related Rh–glutathione
compound 8, {Na2[RhIII2(HA)4]·7H2O}n (H3A = glutathione), have also been included.23 For all three H2L ligands, the EXAFS
spectra collected from the solid Rh products (5–7) overlapped with those of the corresponding solution (Figure S-11), whereas the EXAFS spectra of 5–8 did not completely match (Figure S-12).

the dinuclear Rh-glutathione reaction product (8) (see Table 3).

The curve-fitting
results in k-space revealed
that the mean Rh–(N/O) and Rh–S distances vary over
a narrow range of 2.08–2.10 and 2.315–2.34 Å, respectively,
with reasonable σ2 values (0.003–0.005 Å2). The Rh···Rh scattering path included in
the fitting models for the Rh–N-acetylcysteine
reaction product 7 resulted in the Rh···Rh
distance 3.10 ± 0.02 Å (σ2 = 0.0047 ±
0.001 Å2), which is similar to that of the Rh–glutathione
reaction product 8.23 For
the Rh–cysteine (5) and Rh–penicillamine
(6) reaction products, the introduction of a Rh···Rh
scattering path to explain the small FT features at ∼3.0 and
∼2.8 Å, respectively, did not yield conclusive results
for such a long and diffuse interaction (see Table S-5).

13C NMR Spectroscopy
To find out whether
the carboxyl group in the thiol-containing ligands is bound to the
Rh(III) ions, carbon-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS)
NMR spectra of the solids 4–7 were
measured, and are compared with those of the pure ligands and Rh2(AcO)4 in Figure 5. We previously assigned the peaks for 0.1 M alkaline
solutions of these ligands (calibrated relative to the CH3OH signal at 49.15 ppm).27−29 The sets of doublets observed
for solid d-penicillamine can be attributed to polymorphs,
that is, two nonequivalent molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit,30,31 although only the structure of crystalline racemic dl-penicillamine
is known.32 Similarly, the crystal structure
has been reported for dihydrated Rh2(AcO)4,33 but not for anhydrous Rh2(AcO)4. The broad peaks at δCOO– = 191.7 and 193.3 ppm observed for Rh2(AcO)4 powder could be due to the presence of two different acetate groups,
with O atoms of some acetate ligands in one molecule coordinated to
the axial positions of another molecule, as in crystalline Rh2(CF3COO)4.34,35

Figure 5 Solid
state 13C CPMAS NMR spectra obtained for Rh2(AcO)4 and its reaction products at a mole ratio
of 1:4 with the ligands cysteine (4, pH = 3.2; 5, pH = 7.4), penicillamine (6), and N-acetylcysteine (7), and for the pure solid
ligands.

The features in the 13C NMR spectra of the diamagnetic
solids 4–7 are broad. However, an
EPR spectrum of 7 showed only trace amounts of paramagnetic
species, making this an unlikely cause of the broadness (see EPR Spectroscopy
section in the Supporting Information).36 Although only one set of broad 13C NMR features is observed for the N-acetylcysteinate
compound 7, there are two sets of NMR signals for 4–6, probably due to two types of binding
modes for the coordinated cysteinate and penicillaminate ligands.
Also, different stereoisomers could lead to some splitting of the 13C NMR resonances into different sets, as for the [CoIII{Rh(N,S-Cys)3}2]3– complex with three possible isomers
(ΔΔ, ΛΛ, ΔΛ) with slightly different
chemical shifts.37 However, the 13C NMR signals for 4–6 in Figure 4 are too broad to
recognize separate stereoisomers.

The 13C NMR resonances
associated with the carboxyl
groups in the H2L ligands (173.6–175.4 ppm) are
generally deshielded in the spectra of their Rh(III) compounds (4–7). For the Rh–penicillamine
reaction product 6 there are two NMR resonances at 176.1
and 181.4 ppm, with the latter ∼7.3 ppm deshielded relative
to that of the pure ligand (average ∼ 174.1 ppm). Also, for
the Δ-fac-H3[Rh(N,S-Cys)3] complex crystallized from a
HCl(aq) solution, the chemical shift δC = 181.0 ppm
has been reported,37 with the deshielding
probably due to weak forces between −COO– and the counter H+ ions.

Previously, we observed
a similar shift of Δδ (13C) = 6.0 ppm for the
carboxylate group in a Pb(II)–penicillamine
solution (CPb(II) = 10 mM, CH2Pen = 20 mM, pH = 9.6), which was then attributed
to the tridentate coordination of a (S,N,O)-Pen2– ligand to the Pb(II)
ion.27 Therefore, we assign the resonance
at 181.4 ppm to a (S,N,O)-Pen2– ligand bound to a Rh(III) ion in 6. The other peak at 176.1 ppm is shifted only ∼2.0
ppm downfield relative to penicillamine, which indicates a penicillaminate
ligand with a COO– group that is not bound to Rh(III).
The small shift could be due to ionic interactions of the COO– group.

For the Rh–cysteine reaction product 4 that
precipitated at pH = 3.2, there are three peaks in the carboxylate
region at 174.0, 182.0, and 194.3 ppm. The latter peak was attributed
to a protonated, noncoordinated carboxyl group (−COOH). This
peak, which disappears in the Rh–cysteine reaction product 5 at pH = 7.4, is ∼1.0 ppm deshielded relative to that
of Rh2(AcO)4 at δC = 193.3
ppm, and could not be related to unreacted dirhodium(II) tetraacetate.
The peak at 182.0 ppm (182.3 ppm in 5), which is shifted
downfield by ∼8.4 ppm relative to that of cysteine (173.6 ppm),
could again be related to a tridentate (S,N,O)-Cys2– ligand bound
to the Rh(III) ion. This peak has lower intensity relative to the
corresponding resonance in the spectrum of the Rh–penicillamine
reaction product 6 (181.4 ppm). The more intense peak
at 174.0 ppm (176.3 ppm in 5) is probably related to
a cysteinate ligand with an uncoordinated COO– group.

Discussion
Aerobic Reaction of 1 with Penicillamine
Within the first few hours after mixing the reagents Rh2(AcO)4 (1) and penicillamine at a mole ratio
of 1:4 (initial pH 4.1), the species [Rh2II(AcO)4(H2Pen)1–2] (Scheme 2a) and [Rh2II(AcO)3(HPen)] (+ or −H+) with a Rh2(II, II) core could be detected with
ESI-MS. Oxidation of the rhodium ions was observed when two deprotonated
penicillamine ligands were present, as in the [Rh2III(AcO)4(HPen)2] complex (Scheme 2b). [Rh2III(Pen)4]2– was detected within the first
10 min of reaction (see Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). The reaction occurs
much faster at pH = 7.4.

Scheme 2 Proposed Pathway for Aerobic Reaction of
Rh2(AcO)4 with Penicillamine: (a) [RhII2(AcO)4(H2Pen)], (b) [RhIII2(AcO)4(HPen)2], (c) H2[RhIII(Pen)4], and Its Oxidized Form (d) H2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2], All
Detected by ESI-MS at Acidic pH
The
reactions occur much faster
at pH = 7.4, leading to compound 6, Na2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O, with a structure similar to (d).

The ESI-mass
spectrum in the – ion mode of the Rh–penicillamine
compound Na2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O (6) dissolved in water
was dominated by mass peaks for [RhIII2Pen4 + H+]− (−m/z = 794.96) at fragmentor voltage = 0 V, and [RhIII2Pen4 ]2– (−m/z = 396.98) at 80 V, and their m/z +8 and +16 satellites. An absorption
peak at 2475.6 eV in the S K edge XANES spectrum of 6 further revealed the presence of a sulfenato group (S=O)
bound to Rh(III); see Results section.

Oxidation of metal-bound thiolates by peroxides to sulfenato groups
has been previously reported for thiolato Co(III)38,39 and thiolato Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes,40 as well as for glutathione-bound Ru(II)-arene and organo-Ir(III)
anticancer compounds.41−43 Liu and Sadler proposed that hydrogen peroxide (detected
by a H2O2 test stick), formed from O2(g), provides the sulfenato (S=O) oxygen atom,42 as previously suggested by the Dunbar group.15 Here, we also propose that oxidation of the
Rh24+ core in 1 to Rh26+ in 6 occurs by reduction of oxygen (O2) to peroxide (eq 1), which in turn may oxidize a coordinated penicillamine thiolato
to a sulfenato (S=O) group (eq 2). Formation of peroxide in the reaction mixture was
confirmed by an iodine test (see Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information).44 1   2  The structure of the Rh–penicillamine
compound 6 was probed by Rh K edge EXAFS, complemented
by 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, which revealed 3.1 Rh–(N/O)
and 3.2 Rh–S distances at 2.09 ± 0.02 and 2.32 ±
0.02 Å, respectively (Figure 4 and Table 3). The observation of two 13C NMR signals at 181.4
and 176.1 ppm for this solid (Figure 5) provides evidence for two types of carboxylate groups,
and thus supports two coordination modes for the Rh(III)-bound penicillamine
ligands: tridentate (S,N,O-Pen) and bidentate (S,N-Pen); see Results section. Compound 6 is expected to have a similar structure as that shown in Scheme 2d.

Scheme 2 displays
our proposed pathway for the aerobic reaction between Rh2(AcO)4 and penicillamine (mole ratio of 1:4). In the proposed
structure for Na2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O (6), the O atom is bound
to the S atom of a tridentate (S,N,O-Pen) ligand because in Rh–S–C,
the S atom, with bonds to two other atoms, is sterically less hindered
for nucleophilic attack by peroxide than the bridging S atom in Rh–Sbridge–Rh with three bonds (Scheme 2).38,39

In our CSD survey,
only three crystalline dithiolato-bridged binuclear
Rh(III) complexes were found, for which the average Rh···Rh
distance is 3.54 ± 0.03 Å (see Table S-6a–c in the Supporting Information). In the binuclear [RhIII(μ-S,N-C6H6NS)(η1-S-C6H6NS)(bpy)]22+ complex with a similar (S,N)-donor ligand as that in the Rh–penicillamine
compound 6, the Rh···Rh distance is 3.51(3)
Å.14 The contribution of Rh···Rh
scattering to the overall Rh K edge EXAFS spectrum of 6 would be insignificant for a long nonbonded distance (with high
σ2), and does not appear as a well-resolved peak
in the EXAFS Fourier transform in Figure 4.

Aerobic Reaction of 1 with Cysteine
The
aerobic reaction of Rh2(AcO)4 with cysteine
at a mole ratio of 1:4 differs from that with penicillamine. The diamagnetic
precipitate gradually formed at pH = 3.2 was separated and analyzed
with the empirical formula {Rh2III(HCys)2(Cys)2·4H2O}n (4). When raising the pH of the reaction mixture,
the precipitate dissolved completely at pH = 3.9. The solid product
obtained after initially adjusting the pH of the reaction mixture
to 7.4 (see Experimental Section) empirically
corresponds to the formula {Na2[RhIII2(Cys)4]·5H2O}n (5).

The Rh K edge EXAFS spectrum of this solid
was identical to that of 4 (Figure S-13), but had a different phase and amplitude when compared
with that of the Rh–penicillamine compound 6 (see Figure S-12, top). Least-squares curve-fitting
of the EXAFS oscillation for the solid 5 revealed contributions
from 2.0 Rh–(N/O) and 4.1 Rh–S bond distances at 2.10
± 0.02 and 2.34 ± 0.02 Å, respectively (see Figure 4 and Table 3).

The 13C
CPMAS NMR spectrum of the solid 5 displays a main peak
at 176.3 ppm and a shoulder at 182.3 ppm (Figure 5) assigned to bidentate
(S,N-Cys) and tridentate (S,N,O-Cys), respectively
(see Results section). The different relative
intensity of these two peaks, as compared with the 13C
NMR spectrum of the Rh–penicillamine compound Na2[Rh2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O (6), implies that the bidentate (S,N)-mode
of the cysteinate ligands in 5 dominates.

The weak
absorption at 2475.6 eV in the S K edge XANES spectrum
of the Rh–cysteine compound 5 shows a significantly
smaller amount of sulfenato (S=O) groups than that in 6 (Figure 3). However, in the ESI-mass spectrum of 5 (dissolved
in water), the m/z +8 and +16 satellites
for the peaks at (−)m/z =
340.91 and 682.83 correspond to one or two additional oxygen atoms
to the [Rh2(Cys)4]2– and [Rh2(Cys)4 + H+]− mass
ions (Figure 2 and Table 2), respectively, indicating
that ESI-MS is a more sensitive probe for detecting small amounts
of additional O atoms. Even at the low fragmentor voltage of 10 V,
intense m/z +8 and/or 16 peaks were
identified for the mass ions [Rh2(Cys)4 + H+]− (−m/z = 682.83) and [Rh2(Cys)5 + 3H+]− (−m/z = 803.84);
see Figure S-10 and Table S-4. It is unlikely
that the added O atoms are generated from oxidation in the ESI-MS
instrument because, for example, no m/z +8 and/or 16 satellites were observed for [RhIII2(AcO)4(HNAC)2 + Na+]+ (+m/z = 788.90) or N-acetylcysteine [H2NAC – H+]− (−m/z = 162.02) in Figures S-2 and S-6, respectively.

At the fragmentor voltage of 80 V, additional mass peaks corresponding
to tri- and tetranuclear species appeared, such as: [Rh3(Cys)6]3– (−m/z = 340.91), [Rh3(Cys)6 +
H+]2– (−m/z = 511.87), [Rh3(Cys)6 + H+ + O]2– (−m/z = 519.87), [Rh4(Cys)8 + H+]3– (−m/z =
454.89), and [Rh4(Cys)8 + 2H+ + O]2– (−m/z =
690.83). The ESI-MS analysis of the Rh–penicillamine reaction
product 6 also shows minor amounts of similar tetramers
{Na2[Rh2(Pen)4]}n (n = 2), based on the isotopic patterns of
the peaks (−)m/z = 794.96
and 810.95 for the [Rh4(Pen)8 + 2H+]2– and [Rh4(Pen)8 + 2H+ + O]2– ions, respectively (see Table 2). Although some cluster
formation could also be observed in the ESI-mass spectra of pure Rh2(AcO)4 in water (Figure S-6), the difference between the EXAFS spectra of 5 and 6 (Figure S-12) can only be explained
by the presence of oligomeric species in 5.

On
the basis of the combined results, we conclude that in the reaction
product 5 of Rh2(AcO)4 and cysteine
(pH = 7.4), the Rh(III) ions are connected via double thiolate bridges
probably in at least up to tetrameric species, although some dimeric
Na2[Rh2(Cys)4] complexes, similar
to those found for the Rh–penicillamine compound 6, cannot be ruled out. Scheme 3 displays our proposed structure for a tetramer {Na2[Rh2(Cys)4]}n (n = 2) and its oxidized form, as identified by ESI-MS.

Scheme 3 Proposed Structures for a Tetrameric {Na2[Rh2(Cys)4]}2 Complex in Compound 5
The lower image is its oxidized
form, detected by ESI-MS, with sulfenato (S=O) groups.

In a large oligomeric structure for 5, there are four
Rh–S and two Rh–(N/O) bonds around the Rh(III) ions
(except for the terminal units), as indicated by the EXAFS data analysis
(Table 3). Only the
S atoms with two bonds in the terminal tridentate (S,N,O-Cys) ligands are expected
to be oxidized by peroxide to sulfenato (S=O) groups because
the bridging thiolate groups with three bonds are less susceptible
to nucleophilic attack by peroxide.38 The
number of unbound COO– groups is considerably higher
than that of the bound terminal COO–, which gives
rise to a small shoulder at δ = 182.3 ppm in the 13C CPMAS NMR spectrum of 5 (Figure 5). The close overlap of the EXAFS spectra
(Figure S-13) indicates that the structures
of the Rh–cysteine precipitate 4, {Rh2(Cys)2(HCys)2·4H2O}n from acidic (pH = 3.2) media, and 5 are similar, apart from the protonated −COOH groups in 4, shown by the 13C NMR resonance at δ =
194.3 ppm (Figure 5).

The chiral [Rh(S,N-Cys)3]3– complex readily functions as a S-donating
ligand
to form linear S-bridged trinuclear [M{Rh(S,N-Cys)3}2]3–/4– complexes with various metal ions (M = CrIII, CoII or III, and NiII) with MS6 coordination,37,45,46 as well as in the T-cage S-bridged polynuclear complex [{Rh(S,N-Cys)3}4Zn4O]6–, which has been studied for decades.47 Polynuclear S-bridged structures such as the
tetranuclear one proposed in Scheme 3 for the {[RhIII2(S,N-Cys)4]2–}n (n = 2) complex are other examples
of this type of multinuclear compound, formed in absence of a different
metal ion (M).

Such oligomers could be formed with morphologically
similar but
not identical Rh(III) centers, for example, with different orientations/conformations
of Cys2– or Pen2– rings. The variations
in the local environment of the carbon atoms in these ligands would
result in broad signals in the 13C NMR spectra in Figure 5.48−52 Recently, a 1H NMR spectrum was reported
for a D2O solution of S-methylcysteine
coordinated to the axial position of Rh2(AcO)4 (mole ratio of 1:1); the broad signals observed in this spectrum
were attributed to J(H,H) coupling.53

Aerobic Reaction of 1 with N-Acetylcysteine
Monitoring the slow reaction of
Rh2(AcO)4 (1) with N-acetylcysteine (mole ratio
of 1:4) at the pH of mixing (pH = 1.9) with ESI-MS revealed that species
with one N-acetylcysteine ligand (in protonated or
even fully deprotonated form) still keep the RhII–RhII core, as in [RhII2(AcO)4(H2NAC)] and [RhII2(AcO)3(HNAC)] (with ±H+ or +Na+) as well as
[RhII2(AcO)2(NAC)]. Similar to the
penicillamine reaction, oxidation to Rh(III) is observed in species
with two deprotonated N-acetylcysteine ligands:
[RhIII2(AcO)4(HNAC)2]
and [RhIII2(AcO)3(HNAC)2]+ (see Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information).

Following the
reaction in acidic solution with UV–vis spectroscopy showed
after 48 h, an intense absorption peak at λmax =
367 nm (Figure 1, left),
which is attributed to a S– → RhIII ligand-to-metal charge-transfer band of the [RhIII2(AcO)4(HNAC)2] complex, which is the
main Rh(III) complex according to the ESI-mass spectrum (+m/z = 766.91, 788.90, and 810.88 for +H+/Na+ ions, Table 1 and Figure 1 right). The EXAFS spectrum of this complex could not be obtained
due to the presence of unreacted Rh2(AcO)4 (see 1H NMR and ESI-mass spectra in Appendix 1).

The solid reaction product at pH = 7.4, purified
by size exclusion
chromatography, has the empirical formula {Na2[Rh2(NAC)4]·4.5H2O}n (7), based on elemental analysis. The Rh K edge
EXAFS spectra of 7 and of the corresponding Rh–cysteine
reaction product 5 show main FT peaks of similar magnitude,
but with an additional feature at ∼2.7 Å for 7, as also found for the Rh–glutathione reaction product 8 (Figure S-12).23 Its EXAFS oscillation was best modeled with 2 Rh–O,
4.6 Rh–S, and 0.8 Rh···Rh interactions at mean
distances of 2.09 ± 0.02, 2.32 ± 0.02, and 3.10 ± 0.02
Å, respectively, which are similar to those obtained for 8 (see Figure 4 and Table 3). The
Rh–O scattering contribution is better resolved for 8, appearing as a shoulder in the main FT peak, probably due to less
noise in its EXAFS oscillation. Simultaneous refinement of the Rh–O
coordination number for 7 resulted in an unreasonably
high value (5.7) for the Rh–S coordination number, and very
small σ2 for Rh–O (see Table S-5). In the trimeric ΔΛ-[Rh{Ir(aet)3}2]3+ complex (CSD code: AQUVOX), the
central Rh(III) ion is surrounded by six bridging thiolate groups
with the average Rh–S distance 2.381 Å,19 which is longer than the refined mean Rh–S distance
in 7. Therefore, a model including two Rh–O and
four Rh–S scattering paths seems reasonable. The RhIII···RhIII distance in 7 is
comparable with the RhIII···IrIII distance of 3.0199(3) Å in the [Rh{Ir(aet)3}2]3+ complex with three bridging thiolate groups
between the Rh(III) and Ir(III) ions in N3Ir(μ-S)3Rh(μ-S)3IrN3 coordination.19

The 13C CPMAS NMR spectrum
of 7 only shows
one set of broad peaks for the coordinated N-acetylcysteine,
with the COO– group resonating at δ = 177.1
ppm, shifted downfield only by Δδ (13C) = 1.7
ppm relative to that of the pure ligand (Figure 5), indicating that the carboxylate group
is not directly bonded to the Rh(III) atoms in 7. The
ESI-mass spectrum of this product in water at fragmentor voltage 0
V was dominated by mass peaks for tetranuclear RhIII4(NAC)8–10 (m/z = 850.87, 932.39, and 1024.88) or dinuclear RhIII2(NAC)4 species, and their m/z +8 satellites for one added O atom (see Figure S-9 and Table S-3).

The EXAFS results show that
{Na2[Rh2(NAC)4]·4.5H2O}n (7) contains triply
S-bridged RhIII···RhIII units
with a well-defined distance of 3.10 ± 0.02
Å that gives rise to an extended EXAFS oscillation (Figure 4). A single or double
thiolate bridge connecting those dimeric units into an oligomeric
structure, as proposed in Scheme 4, would be consistent with the refined coordination
number of 4.6 for the Rh–S scattering path. The scattering
contribution from Rh(III) ions bridged by one or two thiolate groups
(as in compound 5) at Rh···Rh distances
>3.5 Å would be damped in the EXAFS oscillation.

Scheme 4 Proposed
Oligomeric Structures for the {Na2[Rh2(NAC)4]·4.5H2O}n (Compound 7)
An oligomeric structure
for 7 would justify the Rh4(NAC)8–10 and Rh6(NAC)10–12 mass ions in the
ESI-MS spectra (Tables 1 and S-3). In
such an oligomeric structure, only the terminal thiolate can be oxidized
by peroxide to a sulfenato group. In the ESI-mass spectrum of 7, just one added O atom was observed as an m/z +8 satellite for the dimeric (−m/z = 866.87) or tetrameric (−m/z = 858.87) Rh–N-acetylcysteine species (see Tables 1 and S-5), indicating that
there are more bridging than terminal thiolate groups.

Conclusions
Aerobic reactions of Rh2(AcO)4 with the thiol-containing
amino acid cysteine (H2Cys) and its derivatives penicillamine
(H2Pen) and N-acetylcysteine (H2NAC) in different mole ratios (1:2, 1:4, and 1:6) at pH = 7.4 result
in the formation of the diamagnetic compounds {Na2[RhIII2L4]·xH2O}n (L = Cys and NAC; x = 4.5–5) and Na2[RhIII2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O. The complexes were structurally characterized by combining the
results from Rh K edge EXAFS, S K edge XANES, and solid state 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopic techniques. In the binuclear penicillamine
complex, the thiolate groups of two (S,N-Pen) ligands bridge the Rh(III) ions and the other two terminal
ligands bind in tridentate mode (S,N,O-Pen); the bond to the COO– group
was evidenced by a change of chemical shift ΔδC = 7.3 ppm relative to that of the pure ligand. Oxidation of Rh24+ to Rh26+ occurs through
oxygen (O2) that is reduced to peroxide, which in turn
can partially oxidize terminal thiolate (S–RhIII) to sulfenato (O=S–RhIII) groups. The presence
of sulfenato groups in Na2[RhIII2(Pen)2(Pen(SO))2]·4.5H2O was
confirmed by a peak at 2475.6 eV in its S K edge XANES spectrum.

The high Rh–S coordination number obtained from the EXAFS
data analysis of the compound {Na2[RhIII2(Cys)4]·5H2O}n is consistent with oligomeric species in which dithiolate
bridges of chelating (S,N-Cys) ligands
connect the Rh(III) ions. In comparison with the dimeric penicillamine
complex, there are fewer terminal tridentate (S,N,O-Cys) ligands that can then be oxidized
to sulfenato groups (O=S–RhIII), which could
only be detected by ESI-MS.

In the compound {Na2[RhIII2(NAC)4]·4.5H2O}n, N-acetylcysteine behaves
similarly to glutathione and acts
as a monodentate S-donor ligand, forming a triple (S-NAC) bridge between two Rh(III) ions with a well-defined Rh···Rh
distance of 3.10 ± 0.02 Å, according to the Rh K edge EXAFS
data analysis. Those dimeric units are probably linked together into
oligomeric complexes by single or double thiolate bridges. The bridging
thiolate groups, sterically hindered by bonds to three atoms, are
not oxidized by peroxide, leaving only the terminal thiolates (S–RhIII) exposed to oxidation to sulfenato groups.

The results
of this study reveal the structure of products that
could form when antitumor active rhodium(II) tetraacetate, Rh2(AcO)4, interacts with thiol-containing proteins
and peptides, whether acting like N-acetylcysteine
or glutathione as a monothiolate entity, or as the (S,N-) chelate
cysteine in an N-terminal site of a protein.
