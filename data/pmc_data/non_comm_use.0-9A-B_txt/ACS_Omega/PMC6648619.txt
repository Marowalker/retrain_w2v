Tyrosine-based
dipeptides self-assemble to form higher order structures.
To gain insights into the nature of intermolecular interactions contributing
to the early stages of the self-assembly of aromatic dipeptides, we
study the dimers of linear dityrosine (YY) and tryptophan–tyrosine
(WY) using quantum-chemical methods with dispersion corrections and
universal solvation model based on density in combination with energy
decomposition and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses. We find that
hydrogen bonding is a dominant stabilizing force. The lowest energy
structure for the linear YY dimer is characterized by Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr. In contrast, the lowest energy
dimer of linear WY is stabilized by Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp and πtyr···πtyr. The solvent plays a critical role as it can change the
strength and nature of interactions. The lowest energy for linear
WY dimer in acetone is stabilized by Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr, πtrp···H(C), and πtrp···H(N). The ΔG of
dimerization and stabilization energies of solvated dipeptides reveal
that the dipeptide systems are more stable in the solvent phase than
in gas phase. NBO confirms increased magnitudes for donor–acceptor
interaction for the solvated dipeptides.

1 Introduction
Noncovalent
interactions (NCI), although not as strong as covalent
bonds, are essential for some of the most basic biological and chemical
phenomena. They are found in a wide variety of biological, chemical,
organic crystal, and organic materials assemblies and are essential
to their form and function.1−3 Perhaps most important to life,
NCI hold together and stabilize the double strands of DNA and the
secondary structures of proteins. They also play a crucial role in
protein–protein interactions, protein–DNA interactions,
and protein recognition and signaling.4−6

Aromatic peptides,
in particular, can come together to form higher
order discrete structures, such as micelles and vesicles, or continuous
structures, such as fibers, ribbons, and tapes.7 Dipeptides self-assemble even more readily into three-dimensional
structures,8 and the type of structure
that forms is dependent on many environmental factors, including solvent
choice, dipeptide concentration, and temperature, but one of the most
common structures are nanotubes. Dipeptide nanotubes have an attractive
set of physical and chemical properties useful for many potential
applications such as biological grafts, drug delivery tools, vaccine
carriers, biosensors, antibiotics, microelectronic devices, transmembrane
ion channels, matrices for chromatography, and self-cleaning surfaces.7−15 They are readily available, easily customizable, and environmentally
and biologically safe. They also tend to be robust in heat, pH, and
enzymatic degradation. For instance, diphenylalanine (FF) nanotubes,
the most common and widely studied dipeptide nanotube, are stable
in temperatures up to 150 °C.8,16,17

The FF nanotube structure has been well elucidated.9,14−18 The FF monomer has two aromatic rings, stabilized by NCI, and the
FF nanotube is made up of symmetric six-membered rings stacked via
NCI.14,17,18 The outer
diameter of the tube ranges 10–100 nm, whereas the inner diameter
is only around 10 Å.9,13 Within the nanotube,
the monomers are uniform in their structure, which allows for uniform
head to tail alignment.9,15 The FF molecules are in the trans
position, and the L configuration of phenylalanine is used.15,16 An investigation of the isolated dipeptides showed that the peptide
plane has less than a 20° variance from the 180° peptide
plane.20 The most favorable backbone conformation
was found to be folded up such that (NH)H···Ocarboxyl hydrogen bonding between the two exposed termini is formed.21,22 If this conformation was not assumed, a fully outstretched backbone
was the next most stable form.

Although the FF nanotube structure
has been successfully elucidated,
the mechanism of self-assembly remains elusive. Currently, there are
three proposed mechanisms of self-assembly of dipeptides. First, the
dipeptides come together to form two-dimensional β-sheets, which
then roll up into tubes. This “rolling up” process is
proposed to be driven by side chain π–π interactions
and hydrogen bonding.16,23 Second, hydrophobic interactions
cause the dipeptides to form small vesicles to protect their hydrophobic
motifs from the environment. Once a high enough concentration of these
vesicles accumulates, they are thought to fuse into tubes.7,11,18 Finally, the nanotube comes together
in a more piece-wise cooperative manner. It suggests that the side
chains of adjacent FF dipeptides “zipper” together to
form ringlike structures while stacking up into a tube.13,17

Each of these mechanisms demonstrates the well-known importance
of NCI in the self-assembly of dipeptide nanotubes.7−10,18,23,24 Computational
and laboratory studies of FF nanotubes have proven the presence of
electrostatic interactions between charged residues or the carboxylic
acid and amine termini, π–π stacking between aromatic
side chains, hydrophobic interactions to protect the peptide backbones,
and directional hydrogen bonding networks.7−11,18,24 A laboratory-based comparison of FF nanotubes made with modified
monomers revealed that FF monomers with high hydrogen bonding capacity
readily self-assembled into ordered nanostructures, whereas FF monomers
with poor hydrogen bonding capacity only self-assembled into random
β-sheets.11 Additionally, more extensive
hydrogen bonding was found to allow for high-aspect-ratio packing,
further stabilizing the nanotubes.11 A
similar study of phenylalanine–alanine nanotubes confirmed
the presence of both (NH)H···Ocarbonyl hydrogen
bonding.16

There has been little
research on nanotubes made from other aromatic
peptides, such as tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W). These two dipeptides
share many of the same characteristics of phenylalanine but have been
suggested to involve stronger NCI.1,2,12 When comparing the binding of aromatic dipeptides
with nucleosides, it was found that both tyrosine and tryptophan formed
more energetically stable complexes than phenylalanine.1,2 Also, peptides containing a hydroxyl group form more ordered structures
than peptides which do not, suggesting that tyrosine-based nanotubes
would have an even higher aspect ratio than phenylalanine-based nanotubes.12

Our previous work on the conformational
and vibrational analyses
of the isolated linear dityrosine (YY) and tryptophan–tyrosine
(WY), which we refer to as monomers in this paper, showed that the
most stable conformers are characterized by hydrogen bonding
between the carboxylic hydroxyl group and the carbonyl of the amide.50

In this paper, we present our computational
study on the noncovalent
dimers of linear YY and WY toward understanding the early stages of
self-assembly of dipeptide nanotubes. We investigate the types and
magnitudes of NCI, specifically the aromatic interactions and hydrogen
bonding, that are implicated in providing the order and directionality
needed for the self-assembly process. The orbital interactions were
examined in detail. The understanding of such interactions would provide
insights into the aggregation of peptide-based nanostructures.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Full Optimization Dimers
The lowest
energy noncovalent dimer of linear YY, YYd1, as calculated by the
dispersion-corrected third-order density functional-based tight binding
method (DFTB3-D),26 is characterized by
two intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic
group of one dipeptide and the tyrosine hydroxyl group of the other
dipeptide (Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr), each within 1.94 Å (Figure 1). YYd1 has a relatively low dipole moment of 1.50
D. Four other YY dimers are within 4.54 kcal/mol of YYd1; some of
their properties are given in Table 1. YYd2 is 0.48 kcal/mol higher than YYd1 and is stabilized
by two Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr within
1.88 and 2.11 Å and a weak π–π stacking between
two tyrosine rings (πtyr···πtyr) separated by ∼3.94 Å. The Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr is a recurring structural motif,
present in YYd1, YYd2, YYd3, and YYd5, whereas YYd4 has Ocarboxyl···H(O)carboxyl with a distance ∼1.86
Å. Also, YYd5 has NH···πtyr within
2.94 Å. These results imply that hydrogen bonding is an important
NCI between dimers, in agreement with studies focused on the structure
of FF nanotubes.7,9,10

In contrast,
for linear WY dimers, the lowest energy WYd1 is stabilized
in such a way that the carboxylic acid terminal of one monomer interacts
with the other monomer’s tryptophan amine group, resulting
in two Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp within
∼2.02 Å. In addition, WYd1 has πtyr···πtyr stacking interaction within ∼3.58 Å (Figure 2). WYd1 is quite
polar with a dipole moment of 5.02 D. Eight more WY dimers are within
4.33 kcal/mol of WYd1 (Table 1). WYd2, which is 1.05 kcal/mol higher than WYd1, is stabilized
by Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr within
1.95 Å as well as πtrp···H(C)
within 2.98 Å. WYd3 and WYd4 are both stabilized by one intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp. WYd5 is
mainly stabilized by intermolecular Ocarboxyl···
H(O)carboxyl. WYd6 is governed by Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr and πtyr···πtyr. WYd7 and WYd8 are both stabilized by Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp. WYd7 and WYd8 are further stabilized
by πtrp··· H(N) ∼2.88 Å
apart and πtrp···H(C) in around 2.91
Å, respectively. Finally, WYd9 is mostly stabilized by intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr.

Figure 3 shows the
calculated IR spectra for the most stable YY monomer (YY1) and five
lowest noncovalent dimer structures shown in Figure 1 at the DFTB3-D level of theory. For YY1,
some of the representative peaks include free hydroxyl groups (OHtyr) on each of the phenolic rings of dityrosine (3657 and
3671 cm–1), peptide N–H stretching (NHpep, 3316 cm–1), the intense carboxyl O–H
stretch (OHcarboxyl, 3244 cm–1), the
carbonyl of the carboxyl group (COcarboxyl, 1745 cm–1), and carbonyl peptide stretching vibrations (COpep, 1628 cm–1), the peptide N–H in-plane
bending vibration (NHipb, 1526 cm–1),
and carboxyl O–H in-plane bending vibration (OHipb, 1290 cm–1). The characteristic peaks that are
present in the monomer are also present in the dimers. Some peaks
occurred twice in the dimers since there are two monomers in each
dimer, which are in slightly different chemical environments. The
dimers consistently have more intense peaks than the monomers, especially
for the functional groups which participated in hydrogen bonding such
as OHtyr and COpep. In particular, for the lowest
dimer YYd1, the OHtyr occurs at 3663 and 3470 cm–1, the latter a red-shift of about 200 cm–1 with
respect to the monomer YY1, which is a characteristic of intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr. The intense
OHcarboxyl peaks at around 3002 cm–1,
also a red-shift of about 200 cm–1. Other notable
difference is the COcarboxyl, which appears at 1690 and
1684 cm–1, a red-shift of 50 cm–1. The rest of the YYd1 spectrum has similar characteristics as YY1.
For YYd2, one of the OHtyr also shifts to about 3493 cm–1; COcarboxyl is also red shifted. The OHcarboxyl shows at around 3085 cm–1 but not
as strong as YYd1, which has two of this type. YYd3 has distinct peaks
at around 3533 and 3100 cm–1 for intermolecular
and intramolecular OH bonding, respectively. Similarly, YYd4 shows
intermolecular OHtyr and intramolecular OHcarboxyl around 3420 and 3150 cm–1, respectively. YYd5
shows intermolecular OHtyr at 3488 cm–1 and intramolecular OHcarboxyl around 3251 and 3161 cm–1.

YY dimers at DFTB3-D level of theory.

Figure 4 shows
the
calculated IR spectra for the most stable WY monomer (WY1) and the
nine lowest WY noncovalent dimers, and the corresponding frequencies
are summarized in Table S1. For WY1, the
representative peaks include OHtyr (3658 cm–1), N–H stretching of the tryptophan group (NHtrp, 3361 cm–1), NHpep (3305 cm–1), OHcarboxyl (3223 cm–1), COcarboxyl (1742 cm–1), COpep (1626 cm–1), NHipb (1519 cm–1),
and OHipb (1266 cm–1). The lowest dimer
WYd1 has very similar spectra compared to WY1, and the main differences
are the presence of Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp at about 3299 cm–1 and the red-shift
of intramolecular OHcarboxyl to about 3120 cm–1. For WYd2, the intermolecular Ocarboxyl···OHtyr shows at 3549 cm–1 and one of the OHcarboxyl shifts to 3020 cm–1. For WYd3, the
intermolecular Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp peaks at 3325 cm–1 and one of the OHcarboxyl shows at 3100 cm–1. For WYd4, both peaks of OHcarboxyl are red shifted to 2992 and 3094 cm–1 and the intermolecular Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp peaks at 3323 cm–1. For WYd5, the OHcarboxyl shows at 3138 and the intermolecular Ocarboxyl···H(O)carboxyl peaks at 3430 cm–1. For WYd6, the intermolecular Ocarboxyl···OHtyr shows at 3550 cm–1, and one of the OHcarboxyl shifts to 3130 cm–1. For WYd7 and
WYd8, one of the OHcarboxyl shows at 3144 and 3129 cm–1, respectively. For WYd9, one of the OHcarboxyl shows at 3184 cm–1 and the intermolecular Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr peaks at 3509
cm–1.

and the nine lowest
WY dimers at DFTB3-D level of theory.

The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest
unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of the most stable noncovalent dimers YYd1
and WYd1 consist of π and π* orbitals, respectively (see Figure S1). The YYd1 HOMO is localized around
one of the tyrosine rings of each dipeptide, whereas the LUMO is localized
around the other tyrosine ring on each dipeptide. In contrast, the
WYd1 HOMO is localized around both tryptophan rings, whereas its LUMO
is localized around both tyrosine rings. The difference in localization
between the HOMO and LUMO demonstrates the importance of charge-transfer
interactions in the stabilization of each dipeptide dimer.

Table 1 also shows
that the more negative the binding energy, the more stable the dimer
is. YYd1 has a binding energy of −18.48 kcal/mol, whereas WYd1
has a slightly lower binding energy of −17.71 kcal/mol. Such
a result implies that the stability of aromatic dipeptide dimers is
dependent on the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr vs Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp). Table 2 shows the thermodynamic properties of YYd1
and WYd1 dimerization, which indicate that the dimerization of each
dipeptide is thermodynamically favorable at room temperature.

The pair interaction energy decomposition analyses (PIEDA)27 using fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method28 at the second-order Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory (FMO-MP2) and natural bond orbital (NBO)29 analysis were used to investigate the nature
of the NCI present in each lowest energy dimer in more detail. Consistent
with the binding energy trend, WYd1 has less total interaction energy
compared to YYd1. As shown in Figure 5 and in agreement with the findings of Lee and co-workers30 and Karthikeyan and co-workers,3 electrostatic is dominant in YYd1 due to two intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr hydrogen
bonds. In contrast, for WYd1, both electrostatic and dispersion are
important because of the presence of two Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp and πtyr···πtyr stacking interactions with donor–acceptor (DA) stabilization
energies of 6.55 and 0.47 kcal/mol, respectively.

dimers YYd1 and WYd1 at FMO-MP2/6-31G*.

2.2 Constrained Optimization of the Dimers
To deconstruct the nature of interaction for each specific functional
group present, we performed constrained optimization of the dimers
in such a way that the functional groups were oriented in either parallel
displaced (PD) or T-shaped configurations instead of the full optimization
employed in the previous section. The details are described in the Supporting Information. For linear WY, three
functional group combinations were evaluated: W−W, Y−Y,
and W−Y. The PD and T-shaped orientations were considered.
For the PD orientation, two configurations for the carboxylic group
are shown in this paper: on the opposite side (a-PD) and the same
side (b-PD).

In PD constrained functional group dimers, each
functional group combination has a ring–ring distance within
3.45–3.67 Å, as shown in Table 3, consistent with the studies on peptide-like
systems that the characteristic distance between PD aromatic rings
ranges from 3.3 to 3.7 Å.2,4,30,31 The ring–ring distance
is found to be closer to 3.7 Å if the monomers are small, as
demonstrated by the Y−Y ring–ring distance of 3.67 Å
for a-PD and 3.81 for b-PD, whereas closer to 3.3 Å for
heterofunctional group, as supported the W−Y ring–ring
distance of 3.45 Å for a-PD and 3.53 Å for b-PD.2,32Figure 6 shows that
for each functional group dimer, the HOMO and LUMO are made up of
mainly π and π*, respectively. Y−Y has the largest
HOMO–LUMO gap, whereas W−W has the smallest. W−W
also has the most negative interaction energy for a-PD configuration,
whereas W−Y for b-PD configuration.

dimers of linear WY, describing the W—W, Y−Y, and W−Y. The
a-PD orientation is when the carboxylic groups are on the opposite
sides of the dimer while b-PD is when they are on the same side.

The T-shaped
orientation constrained dimers have ring–ring
distances within 6.3–7.8 Å (Table 3). Studies on peptide-like systems have shown
that T-shaped orientations between aromatic rings typically range
from 4.9 to 5.5 Å, a shorter range than observed for these WY
dimers.6,30,33 Studies thus
far have been on isolated functional rings. For example, to model
tryptophan, a single indole ring would have been used. The uses of
entire dipeptide molecules and the resulting longer ring–ring
distances demonstrate that the ideal ring–ring distance between
T-shaped aromatic rings is influenced heavily by the chemical environment. Figure 7 shows that for T-shaped
orientations, the HOMO is mainly made up of π orbitals localized
around the tryptophan ring of one dipeptide, whereas each LUMO is
mainly made up of π* orbitals localized around the second dipeptide’s
tryptophan ring. This suggests that for T-shaped orientations, charge
transfer plays a role in stabilizing the linear WY dimer. As shown
in Table 3, the W−W
has the lowest HOMO–LUMO gap and is the most reactive. FMO-MP2
PIEDA results also show that W−W has the most negative interaction
energy.

Figure 7 HOMO (bottom) and LUMO (top) of the T-shaped orientation constrained
dimers of linear WY, describing (a) W−W, (b) Y−Y, and
(c) W−Y.

Figure 8 shows that
dispersion is dominant for both PD orientations of the constrained
dimers. W−W has the most negative dispersion energy since its
tryptophan has a larger area for delocalization. W−Y has more
negative dispersion energy than Y−Y suggesting that having
the tryptophan ring increases dispersion interactions. Furthermore,
W−W also has the most positive exchange energy, exhibiting
more π–π orbital repulsion. On the other hand,
T-shaped constrained dimers showed that in addition to dispersion
energy, electrostatic interactions are also significant which can
be attributed to polarized (X)H···π interaction
between the two monomers.2,5,6,34 Similar to the PD counterparts,
W−W has the most negative dispersion energy and the most positive
exchange energy; Y−Y has significantly less interaction energy
of every type, likely because the tyrosine functional groups were
farther away from one another.

W−W, Y−Y,
and W−Y in a-PD, b-PD, and T orientation constrained dimers
of linear WY as calculated by FMO-MP2/6-31G* PIEDA level of theory.

Table 4 shows that
each interaction is stabilized by π from one monomer to π*
of another monomer. This interaction occurs between the edges of the
rings, which are closest to one another. W−W is stabilized
by 0.51 and 0.34 kcal/mol for a-PD and b-PD, respectively. For W−Y,
aside from π to π*, which is stabilized by about 0.3 kcal/mol
for PD, π to σ* is also a factor in its stabilization.
The interactions in T-orientations are stronger, W−W is stabilized
by π donation from one tryptophan ring to σ* C–H
in the other tryptophan ring by about 0.78 kcal/mol. W−Y is
stabilized by π of tyrosine ring to σ* C−H of the
tryptophan by 0.95 kcal/mol.

2.3 Solvation Effects
In the presence
of acetone, the range of the relative energies is much closer, about
2–3 kcal/mol for five lowest energy YY and WY dimers compared
to 3–5 kcal/mol for the gas-phase dimers (Table 1). The ordering of the dimer
conformers did not change for the solvated linear YY. The lowest energy
structure for the solvated linear YY dimer is referred to as
sYYd1. In general, the presence of acetone in the system makes the
dipeptide monomers closer together. For example, the intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr for sYYd1
occurs at about 1.89 Å compared to 1.94 Å of the unsolvated
YYd1. In contrast, the lowest energy structure for the solvated linear
WY is not the same as that in the gas phase. Instead, the lowest is
sWYd2, which showed closer Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr and πtrp···H(X) [X = C
and N]. Solvation with acetone has little geometric effect on sWYd2,
which has a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.27, with respect
to WYd2 but has more effect on the YYd1 dipeptide system, which has
an RMSD of 0.69 (Figure S3). Similarly,
the IR spectra show that when solvation is added, the peaks become
typically more intense due to their greater polarity (Figure 9), and the peaks
are also slightly red shifted, particularly for the intermolecular
OHcarboxyl by about 100 cm–1 to about
2900 cm–1. Table 2 shows the ΔG of dimerization
and stabilization energies of solvated dipeptides indicating that
the dipeptide systems are more stable in the solvent phase. NBO confirms
increased magnitudes for DA interaction for the solvated dipeptides.

3 Summary and Conclusions
Analysis of
the lowest energy noncovalent dimers of linear YY and
WY dipeptides demonstrated that hydrogen bonding is a major stabilizing
force. The most stable dimer of linear YY is stabilized by two intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(O)tyr hydrogen
bonds, whereas the linear WY dimer is stabilized by two intermolecular
Ocarboxyl···H(N)trp and πtyr···πtyr stacking interactions.
The interactions πtrp···H(C) and πtrp···H(N) are important in the solvated linear
WY. The different types of intermolecular hydrogen bonding were
all confirmed in the calculated IR spectra and NBO results. For the
higher energy dimer configurations, when hydrogen bonding is present,
electrostatic energy makes up a majority of the interaction energy
within the dimer. The presence of tryptophan in linear WY indicates
greater propensity for dispersion compared to linear YY. Exchange
and charge-transfer interactions are consistently found to have slightly
lower but important contributions to the total interaction energy.
Analyses of PD and T-shaped constrained functional group dimers showed
that the favored orientation is dependent on the functional group
and chemical environment. The most favorable functional group interaction
is Y−Y for linear YY and W−Y for linear WY. The addition
of solvent stabilizes the dipeptide dimers and results in red-shift
and higher IR intensities. The understanding of such interactions
would provide insights into the aggregation of self-assembled structures
from peptide-based molecular frameworks.

4 Methods
We use the structures of the lowest energy monomers (YY1 and WY1)
as determined in ref (25). Three commonly reported dimer orientations were employed: (i) side
by side, where the monomers are adjacent to one another, (ii) parallel
displaced (PD), and (iii) T-shaped, where monomers are oriented perpendicularly.1,4,35,36 The monomers were also flipped around within these orientations
to capture all possible functional group interactions. All dipeptides
employed the LL configuration. Each dimer was then optimized using
DFTB3 employing the parameter set, which is specifically designed
for organic and biological systems (3OB).26,37 The dispersion effects were accounted for by using the universal
force field dispersion model.38 This parameterized
variation of density functional theory (DFT) has decent accuracy for
estimating the geometry of noncovalent systems and reducing overbinding
between monomers, and computational efficiency is two or three orders
faster than conventional DFT methods. FMO-MP2 at 6-31G* basis set39 was used to perform PIEDA.38 NBO39 analysis was also employed
to study the type of donor–acceptor (DA) relationship between
dimers. The solvation model based on density (SMD)40 was used to study the influence of the solvent. Acetone
was chosen as a solvent because it has a dielectric constant (ε)
similar to hexafluoroisopropanol, which was used in typical experiments
of self-assembly of dipeptides. The default values for the atomic
radii were employed. Vibrational frequencies were computed to ensure
that each stationary point is a local minimum, and reaction energetics
were corrected for zero-point energy differences. All quantum-chemical
calculations were performed using GAMESS41 program.
