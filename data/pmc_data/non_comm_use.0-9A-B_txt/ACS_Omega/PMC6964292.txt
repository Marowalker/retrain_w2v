Cannabis sativa is a medicinal plant
having a very complex matrix composed of mainly cannabinoids and terpenoids.
The literature has numerous reports, which indicate that tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) is the only major psychoactive metabolite in C. sativa. It is important to explore other metabolites
having the possibility of exhibiting the psychoactive character of
various degrees and also to identify metabolites targeting other receptors
such as opioid, γ amino butyric acid (GABA), glycine, serotonin,
and nicotine present in C. sativa,
the smoke of C. sativa, and other phytocannabinoid
matrices. This article aims to achieve this goal by application of
batteries of computational tools such as machine learning tools and
multivariate methods on physiochemical and absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) descriptors of 468 metabolites
from C. sativa, its smoke and, other
phytocannabinoids. The structure–activity relationship (SAR)
showed that 54 metabolites from C. sativa have high scaffold homology with THC. Its implications on the route
of administration and factors affecting the SAR are discussed. C. sativa smoke has metabolites that have possibility
of interacting with GABA, and glycine receptors.

Introduction
Globally, mortality
due to narcotic drugs increased by 60% from
2000 (105 000) to 2015 (168 000).1 World consumption of narcotic drugs was estimated to be
275 million in 2016, reporting the use at least once in the earlier
year. Of 275 million, cannabis accounted for 192 million, and some
large countries do not report the true statistics on the use of drugs.2 Many states in the US, Canada, and Uruguay have
legalized cannabis
for medical and recreational purposes. Over the last few decades,
the exploration into the application of cannabis and the derived drugs
to various disorders has been carried out by an increasing number
of research groups in the world.3−6 It is shown to be effective in treatment for schizophrenia,7 epilepsy,8 Parkinson’s
disease,9 brain tumor,10 brain injury,11 oxidative stress
and inflammation,5 inflammatory bowel disease,12 and multiple sclerosis.13 Cannabis-based treatment for chronic neuropathic pain has been studied
in detail14 by several groups. Apart from
cannabis in natural form, a few synthetic drugs such as dronabinol
and sativex have been approved by USFDA for controlling nausea15 and cancer pain,16 respectively. In spite of the use of cannabis and its products for
therapeutic use, scientific evidence is yet to be generated for its
widespread application for the general public.

Cannabis has three species such as Cannabis indica, Cannabis sativa, and Cannabis ruderalis.(17) Small
and Beckstead classified three different
chemophenotypes.18 Chemotype I contains
>0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and <0.5% of cannabidiol
(CBD)
of the total dry plant material, whereas chemotype II has predominantly
CBD and varying quantities of THC. Chemotype III has low THC content.
The main difference between these two species is that indica has higher
cannabidiol (CBD) content and sativa has a higher content of tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC).19 THC has psychoactive properties
resulting in “highness” on consumption, and CBD lacks
any of the psychoactive characteristics. Commercially, C. sativa is cultivated for medical and recreational
purposes. Cannabis is a very complex matrix of 568 compounds, and
the final output depends on the route of administration such as ingestion,
smoking, and vaporization. C. sativa has two phenotypes: one has a high content of THC and another has
a high content of fibers called hemp and its THC content is less than
0.3%. Fiber-rich cannabis plants showed cannabionic acids such as
cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) followed
by their decarboxylated forms, namely, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol
(CBG).20C. sativa has several natural product classes such as terpenes, carbohydrates,
fatty acids, and their esters, amides, amines, phytosterols, phenolic
compounds, and cannabinoids.21 Cannabinoids
bind to cannabinoid receptors, CB1R and CB2R, which are similar to
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family of receptors.22 CB1R encoded by the CNR1 gene consists of 472
amino acids in humans and displays a high degree of sequence homology
(97–99%) with other species.23 CB1R
has three isoforms showing differences in the N-terminal region due
to alternative mRNA splicing patterns.24 The isoform CB1R is expressed predominantly in the brain and skeletal
muscles, and CB1Rb is expressed in liver and pancreatic islet cells
mainly involved in metabolic functions.25 CB2R is encoded by the CNR2 gene and comprises 360 amino acids in
humans. It displays only 44% sequence homology with CB1R and shows
higher diversity among the species.26 CB2R
has two isoforms, and one isoform is expressed in testis and the other
is highly expressed in spleen and the brain regions.27

Chemoinformatics plays a vital role in all stages
of drug discovery.
Drug target identification,28 virtual screening
and structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis,29 hit/lead identification and optimization,30 and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,
and toxicity (ADMET)31 prediction are different
areas of drug discovery, where chemoinformatics is widely applied
with high success. Analysis of drug-like space is important to filter
the molecules from larger databases using chemoinformatic methods32,33 and further taking them to the next step of identification of lead-like
compounds.34 Data mining using machine
learning methods such as support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and neural network algorithms is used in
the virtual screening stage of the drug discovery process.35 The goal of this article is to identify the
THC- or opiate-like candidates from the database of metabolites from C. sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids,
based on the physiochemical descriptors and predicted clinical ADMET
properties using machine learning methods such as naïve-Bayes
(NB), support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and hierchirarchial
clustering methods. Our results identified the possible candidates
having similar physiochemical and ADMET properties to THC by machine
learning, multivariate, and structure–activity relationship
methods, and its consequences on the consumption of cannabis are also
discussed in relation with receptor types in the brain.

Results and Discussion
Drug-like chemical space based on Lipinski’s rule of five
for drug candidates is explored to improve its pharmacokinetic properties.36 Five physiochemical descriptors covered under
Lipinski’s rule of five are shown for all of the metabolites
along with reference psychoactive compounds in Figures 1−6. The molecular
weights of the 468 metabolites from C. sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Molecular weights of
metabolites from C. sativa, its smoke,
and other phytocannabinoids.
Orange circle solid represents metabolite, yellow circle solid reoresents
psychoactive reference compound, green circle solid represents endocannabinoid,
black circle solid represents THC, and black and red lines represent
Lipinski’s and the central nervous system (CNS) cutoff, respectively.

With Lipinski’s
rule of five, only 13 metabolites violated
the cutoff scale of 500 and all of the Schedule I−IV drugs
were well below the Lipinski’s cutoff (black line) for molecular
weight. Pajouhesh et al.37 in the analysis
of physiochemical descriptors for drugs, which include CNS acting
drugs, reported the new cutoff values for physiochemical descriptors
for CNS-targeted drugs. The CNS cutoff (red line) for molecular weight
was 310, and when it was applied to the 468 metabolites, it showed
a significant number of outliers, which include 53% of Schedule I−IV
substances. Endocannabinoids except oleamide, which are natural agonists
for cannabinoid receptors, display molecular weight above the CNS
cutoff value. It is important to mention that THC has the molecular
weight (314) that is closer to CNS cutoff having a psychoactive property
in C. sativa.

In the case of M log P data shown in Figure 2, Lipinski’s
rule of five cutoff is 4.15 (the black horizontal
line in Figure 2) and
CNS drug cutoff is 2.08 (red line).

Figure 2 M log P of metabolites
from C. sativa, its smoke, and other
phytocannabinoids. Orange circle solid represents metabolite, yellow
circle solid represents psychoactive reference compound, green circle
solid represents endocannabinoid, black circle solid represents THC,
and black and red lines represent Lipinski’s and the CNS cutoff,
respectively.

Most of the metabolites along
with Schedule I−IV drugs obey
Lipinski’s cutoff and showed deviation from the CNS drug cutoff
value of 2.08. Cannabinoids from C. sativa, phytocannabinoids, and the volatile products derived from C. sativa showed moderate hydrophobicity.

Total
polar surface area (TPSA) controls the absorption property
of the drugs,38−40 and Lipinski’s cutoff is 140 Å2. Any drug above this value shows poor absorption into the intestines.
TPSA for all of the metabolites, endocannabinoids, and Schedule I−IV
substances is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 TPSA of metabolites from C. sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids. Orange circle solid represents
metabolite, yellow circle solid represents psychoactive reference
compound, green circle solid represents endocannabinoid, black circle
solid represents THC, and black and red lines represent Lipinski’s
and the CNS cutoff, respectively.

The cutoff value of TPSA for CNS drugs is 70 Å2,
and surprisingly the majority of metabolites from C.
sativa have TPSA lower than 70 Å2.
THC showed a TPSA value of 29 Å2, and the highest
TPSA value among endocannabinoids is 69 Å2. Cannabidiol
(CBD), which does not have a psychoactive property, showed a TPSA
value of 78 Å2, and lower TPSA is pronounced in the
case of cannabinoids having a psychoactive property. TPSA may be one
of the best filters to identity the metabolites from cannabinoids
having psychoactive properties.

H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor
properties determine the mode
and strength of ligand–receptor interaction through hydrogen
bonds. As per Lipinski’s rule of five, the permissible number
of H-bond donors is 5 and H-bond acceptors is 10 for a successful
drug. However, in the case of CNS drugs, the cutoff is reduced to
1.5 for a H-bond donor and 4.32 for a H-bond acceptor. As shown in Figure 4a, the majority of
metabolites and endocannabinoids have maximum of 3 H-bond donors.
In the case of Schedule I−IV substances, 95% are shown to have
only 2 H-bond donors.

Figure 4 (a) H-bond donors of metabolites from C.
sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids. Orange
circle solid represents
metabolite, yellow circle solid represents psychoactive reference
compound, green circle solid represents endocannabinoid, black circle
solid represents THC, and black and red lines represent Lipinski’s
and the CNS cutoff, respectively. (b) H-bond acceptor of metabolites
from C. sativa, its smoke, and other
phytocannabinoids. (Orange circle solid) metabolite, (yellow circle
solid) psychoactive reference compound, (green circle solid) endocannabinoid,
(black circle solid) THC, black and red lines represent Lipinski’s
and the CNS cutoff, respectively.

It is clear that CNS drugs and Schedule I−IV substances
interact with their target receptors through hydrophobic interaction
and less dependent on the H-bond network. THC showed only one H-bond
donor and CBD had three H-bond donors. The CDK molecular descriptor
tool calculates H-bond acceptors for the molecule when an oxygen or
a nitrogen in the molecule has formal charge equivalent to or less
than zero (formal charge ≤0). Figure 4b shows that the majority of cannabinoids,
endocannabinoids, and the Schedule I−IV substances showed four
H-bond acceptors.

Effect of the H-bond acceptor on drug efficacy
is less pronounced
from Lipinski’s point of view, and Figure 4b shows that Schedule I−IV substances
having the H-bond acceptor value between 5 and 7 are able to penetrate
the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and exhibit excellent psychoactive
activity.

The number of rotatable bonds affects the molecular
conformational
freedom, and a molecule having less number of rotatable bonds has
structural rigidity. It is important to freeze the bioactive conformation,
and it is achieved by reducing the number of rotatable bonds.41Figure 5 shows the number of rotatable bonds for metabolites from
cannabis, endocannabinoids, and the Schedule I−IV substances.

Figure 5 Number
of rotatable bonds of metabolites from C.
sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids. Orange
circle solid represents metabolite, yellow circle solid represents
psychoactive reference compound, green circle solid represents endocannabinoid,
black circle solid represents THC, and black and red lines represent
Lipinski’s and the CNS cutoff, respectively.

Compliance with Lipinski’s rule of five with a number
of
rotatable bonds (<10) is high for most cannabis metabolites and
the Schedule I−IV substances. All of the endocannabinoids violate
Lipinski’s rule with regard to the number of rotatable bonds
being in the range of 15–19. It is to be noted that endocannabinoids
are lipid moieties having a high number of freely rotatable bonds,
they are synthesized and metabolized in the brain, and moreover they
do not have to cross the blood–brain barrier.

Machine
learning methods are recent tools in identifying the receptor
targets based on structure- and ligand-dependent approaches in the
drug discovery process.42 In this study,
four classifiers, namely, multilayer perceptron, naïve-Bayes,
support vector machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor were
used to identify opiate- and THC/endocannabinoid-like molecules. Initially,
the results of cross-validation performed on the reference candidates
consisting of Schedule I−IV substances, THC endocannabinoids
agonists, and negative controls provided the results shown in Table 1.

a TP: true positive; FP: false positive;
MCC: Matthews correlation coefficient; ROC: receiver operating characteristic;
PRC: precision recall.

The
performance of four classifiers for three types of data was
assessed based on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC area,
and F-measure values. Accuracy quantifies the efficiency
of each classifier to predict the true values. The Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) allows one to judge the performance of a given classifier.
MCC ranges from −1 to +1, where −1 indicates that it
is a wrong binary classifier and +1 is the indication of the correct
classifier. High positive values of ROC and PRC indicate that the
classifier shows high performance for a given data set. Accuracy ranged
from 85 to 99% for different classifiers with three data types. Sensitivity
and specificity quantify the proportion of true positives and negatives,
respectively. Both sensitivity and specificity ranged from 77 to 100%,
where 77% was shown by the NB classifier with CDK–ADMET hybrid
data type.

Diagnosis of Data Overfitting and Subsequent Data Analysis
Accuracy results in the training, cross-validation, and test for
three data types (CDK, CDK–ADMET, and ADMET) using four classifiers
on three unique datasets on reference candidates (training, validation,
and test sets) are given in Table 2a–c.

kNN	100	100	85.71	
Overfitting
of data is diagnosed on the fact that whenever there
is overfitting, the accuracy drastically reduces from training to
test sets. Our results showed that for CDK data type, accuracy was
significantly reduced for NB and kNN classifiers from training to
test sets. In the case of CDK–NB combination, the training
set was observed to be 98.64% and it was reduced to 57% for the test
set. Similarly, in the case of CDK–kNN combination, the accuracy
of 100% observed for the training set was reduced to 57% for the test
set. It can be concluded that NB and kNN classifiers overfit the data
for CDK data type and hence these two classifiers were not included
for analysis involving CDK data type.

The list of candidates
classified as a drug by all four classifiers
from three data types is given in Supplement 1. The four classifiers eliminated 138 candidates from the original
database based on the comparison of predicted physiochemical and clinical
descriptors of Schedule I−IV drugs, endocannabinoid agonists,
and negative controls. In the remaining 330 candidates, about 41%
of the candidates in the list belong to volatile metabolites, and
these volatile compounds gain importance, as smoking is the most common
route of consumption of cannabis products. Smoking is the quickest
way to have a rapid onset of psychoactive effect due to the high bioavailability
of THC in the systemic circulation. Interestingly, three alkanes,
namely, 3-methyl heptane, 4-methyl decane, and nonane were also found
in the volatile mixture of cannabis smoke. Alkanes possess anesthetic
effect, and the anesthetic potency decreases with increasing chain;
moreover, no anesthetic effect is observed from n-undecane (C-11).43

As a next step
of filtering the psychoactive cannabinoid candidates,
nonmetric multidimensional scaling was performed on 330 molecular
candidates obtained from machine learning methods. Multidimensional
scaling (MDS) is a valuable tool to obtain a degree of similarity
among the members of a group in a given data set.44−46 MDS has two
methods, that is, metric and nonmetric MDS. Metric MDS measures similarity-based
interpoint distances between the members of the group and nonmetric
MDS operates by the relative ordering of similarity in an ensemble
of data points. Nonmetric MDS has the advantage over metric MDS as
the magnitude of similarity of input data points is unreliable or
sometimes difficult to measure with high accuracy. MDS has been applied
to analyze the patterns of gene expression47 and evolutionary pathways of GPCR.48 Nonmetric
MDS was performed on 330 candidates using physiochemical molecular
descriptors and later using ADMET descriptors. In the NMDS map, the
outliers were excluded and the remaining candidates were retained
for further analysis. NMDS on physiochemical descriptors resulted
in 165 candidates (Supplement 2), and the
subsequent NMDS using clinical descriptors provided 112 candidates
(Supplement 1). NMDS maps for CDK and ADMET
are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

in 330 dataset. C, P, E, and T denote metabolite, opioid reference
drug, endocannabinoid, and THC, respectively.

in 165 dataset generated by NM-MDS on the CDK dataset. C, P, E, and
T denote metabolite, opioid reference drug, endocannabinoid, and THC,
respectively.

Structure–Activity
Relationship of Cannabinoids
A common scaffold of THC was
compared by three-dimensional (3D) alignment
with every candidate in the group of 112 members from NM-MDS analysis,
and the score obtained for 3D alignment was listed from the highest
to lowest value. The minimum cutoff value of 0.5 was fixed for 3D
alignment, as the cannabidiol having less psychoactive character compared
to THC has a homology score of 0.558, and hence it is taken as the
baseline for assessing the structure–activity relationship.
The candidates having 3D homology till 0.5 were selected for study
on the structure–activity relationship and scaffold homology
of each metabolite with THC, and changes in pharmacophores of each
metabolite in comparison to THC and their corresponding chemical structures
are given in Tables 3A and 3B. In addition, 3D-aligned structures
of each metabolite with THC are provided in Supplement 4.

Table 3B Chemical Structures of 54 Metabolites
Having High 3D Homology with THC
The metabolite having the highest scaffold homology
(0.95) is 8a-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
As shown in Supplement 4-1, it has an additional
hydroxy
moiety at 8th position in the cyclohexene ring and it makes the molecule
more hydrophilic than THC. THC is highly lipophilic and the hydrophobic
regions such as cyclohexene ring, C-5 chain on the phenolic moiety,
and pyran ring interact with membrane lipid hydrophobic acyl chains
and hydrophobic amino acids in transmembrane helices VI and VII of
GPCR as reported in the literature.49 Introducing
an OH group at 8th position on the cyclohexene ring reduces the partition
distribution into the membrane, and it causes unfavorable energy of
the OH group interacting with hydrophobic membrane lipids and the
amino acids in the receptor. Liposome-mediated delivery and masking
the OH group by alkylating with a methyl or an ethyl group may increase
the log P value, thereby increasing membrane
solubility and favorable interaction energy with the receptor. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-C-4
(Supplement 4-2) has homology score of
0.945 and C-5 chain at position 3 of the phenol group is reduced to
C-4 and any decrease in hydrophobic chain length reduces the affinity
with the receptor and potency, as the hydrophobic interaction of C-5
chain with membrane lipids and receptor is vital for receptor activation.
Delta-9-cis-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Supplement 4-16), apart from cis configurational change at
9th position in cyclohexane ring, has a propyl group instead of pentyl
at C-3 position of the phenolic group, which reduces its affinity
for the receptor. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabiorcol (THC-C1) (Supplement 4-35) has a methyl group instead of
pentyl at the C-3 position of the phenolic group, and it reduces the
affinity for the CB1 receptor significantly.

Epoxide ring derivatives
such as 9β,10β-epoxyhexahydrocannabinol
(Supplement 4-4), 9α,10α-tetrahydrocannabinol
epoxide (Supplement 4-5), and 9,10-anhydrocannabitriol
(Supplement 4-7) have epoxide rings at
positions 8–9 in the cyclohexene ring, this epoxide ring is
highly susceptible to hydrolysis under acidic conditions existing
in the stomach, and the end product 8,9-dihydroxy THC is more polar
than THC and hence it may have lower capacity to cross the blood–brain
barrier and partition into the membranes is reduced similar to 8-hydroxy
THC.

The metabolite 7,8-dihydrocannabinol (Supplement 4-6) has an additional double bond at 10–6a position
in the cyclohexene ring and makes it more reactive to undergo metabolism
in the liver. Otherwise, it may be expected to have bioactivity equivalent
to THC. In 10-hydroxy-9-oxo-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Supplement 4-8) and 10-oxo-delta-6a-tetrahydrocannabinol (Supplement 4-9)
(OTHC), additional OH and carbonyl groups at positions 10a and 9 in
the cyclohexene ring make the overall molecule more polar having one
more H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor. The extra OH and carbonyl groups
may result in dimerization by head-to-tail mode of interaction. An
increase in polarity reduces the partition distribution into the membrane
to interact with GPCR.

Delta-8-THC (Supplement 4-11) is an
isomer of THC, which differs only in the position of double bond in
the cyclohexene ring. Delta-8-THC is less psychoactive than delta-9-THC,
and it may be due to low solubility of delta-8-THC in water.50 Isocannbitrol (Supplement 4-12) having two additional OH groups at 8, 9 positions in
the cyclohexene ring makes it highly hydrophilic, and similar to 8-hydroxy-THC,
isocannbitrol may have lower partition distribution into the membranes
for receptor activation. Similarly, 10-hydroxy-delta-9,11-hexahydrocannabinol
(Supplement 4-13) has an extra OH group
in the cyclohexene ring and is more polar than delta-9-THC.

Delta-9-nor-tetrahydrocannabinol (Supplement 4-20) has an ethylene group in the cyclohexene group and the
alkyl chain at C-3 of the phenolic group is reduced to butyl instead
of pentyl group. Dramatic reduction in the scaffold homology (0.647)
with the introduction of the ethylene group at position 8 of the cyclohexene
group generates steric hindrance, and reduction in chain length at
the C-3 position of the phenolic group decreases the affinity for
the receptor. In 2-formyl-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Supplement 4-21), the formyl group at position
2 in the phenolic group may form intra or intermolecular H-bonding
with OH group and may lead to dimerization. As the phenolic OH group
may be engaged intra- or intermolecularly in 2-formyl-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
its involvement with receptor activation may be affected. In addition,
the ethylene group at position 8 of the cyclohexene ring may generate
steric effects similar to delta-9-nor-tetrahydrocannabinol. With 8-oxo-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(Supplement 4-23), the introduction of
the oxo group increases the polarity and hence it reduces the partition
distribution into the membrane to interact with the receptor.

Hexahydrocannabinol (Supplement 4-24)
has a reduced cyclohexane ring instead of a cyclohexene ring, which
alters the orientation of this ring inside the membrane on receptor
interaction due to conformational flexibility.

In cannabinol
(Supplement 4-26), 7-hydroxy
cannabinol (Supplement 4-28), and cannabinol
methyl ether (Supplement 4-33), replacement
of the nonplanar cyclohexene ring with a benzene ring abolishes the
bioactivity, but its affinity for receptor increases, leading to the
antagonistic mode of interaction with GPCR. The aromatic ring in cannabinol
has π-electron cloud, which may interact with positively charged
amino acid Lys or Arg due to cation−π interaction, resulting
in deviation from bioactive conformation. Cation−π binding
in cannabinol and 7-hydroxy cannabinol renders a stronger affinity
for the receptor.

Bis-nor-cannabitrol (Supplement 4-25) and 10-ethoxy-9-hydroxy-delta-6a-tetrahydrocannabinol
(Supplement 4-31) have hydroxyl groups
at positions 9 and 10 in the cyclohexene ring, which makes it highly
hydrophilic and hence its partition distribution into the membrane
reduces significantly. 10-O-Ethyl bis-nor cannabitriol
(Supplement 4-37) has a hydroxyl group
at position 9 in the cyclohexyl ring, which makes it more hydrophilic,
and reducing the chain length from a pentyl to a propyl group at the
C-3 position of the phenolic group leads to low partition distribution
into the membrane and reduces the affinity for the CB1 receptor.

In the case of cannabicycloic acid (Supplement 4-22), delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Supplement 4-3), THCA-A (Supplement 4-32), THCA-B (Supplement 4-15), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid-C-4 (THCA-C-4) (Supplement 4-40),
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabiorcolic acid (THCA-C1) (Supplement 4-42), and delta-9-nor-tetrahydrocannbinolic acid
(Supplement 4-34), the COOH group at various
positions of the phenolic group results in negatively charged species
under physiological conditions. Generally, charged species have a
lower blood–brain barrier,51 and
our predicted ADMET values are in good agreement with the introduction
of the carboxylic group in the phenolic group.

The five metabolites
from cannabis such as compound-2 (Supplement 4-17), compound-3 (Supplement 4-14), 6a-R-cannabichromanone
B (Supplement 4-27), 7-hydroxy cannabichromane
(Supplement 4-29), and bis-nor-cannabichromanone
(Supplement 4-38) lack the cyclohexene
ring and substituted ketones occupy position 3 in the benzopyran ring.
As per the structure–activity relationship rules of cannabinoids,
a nonplanar cyclohexene ring is important but not essential for bioactivity.
When the nonplanar cyclohexene ring is replaced by a bulky substituent
attached to positions 3 and 4, still the molecules can show bioactivity.
However, in the above five metabolites, no bulky substitution is attached
to occupy positions 3 and 4 in the benzopyran ring and hence all of
these five metabolites may not show bioactivity as THC.

Cannabichromanone
(Supplement 4-10)
has a fused tetrahydrofuran ring connecting phenolic OH and the benzopyran
ring. It replaces the cyclohexene ring, and the 2-butanone group is
attached to the C-3 position of the benzopyran ring. It is more nonpolar
than THC, and the missing OH moiety at the phenolic group may reduce
the favorable interaction energy, thereby reducing the affinity for
the CB1 receptor.

In the case of delta-7-trans-isotetrahydrocannabinol
(Supplement 4-30), the benzopyran ring
is broken and as per SAR rules, the loss of benzopyran ring results
in the absence of any bioactivity. Cannabichromanone D (Supplement 4-18) has a ring fused at position
3 of the benzopyran ring and the OH group of the phenolic group. It
also has a carbonyl group at position 4 of the benzopyran ring. SAR
rules of cannabinoids state that even with substitution of the hydroxyl
group of phenolic pharmacophore, the molecule retains bioactivity.
Hence, cannabichromanone D may show bioactivity, as three out of four
pharmacophores may be enough to elicit receptor activation.

In all three metabolites, anhydrocannabimovone (Supplement 4-36), cannabielsoin (Supplement 4-39) (CBE), and cannabiglendol (Supplement 4-51), the 6-membered benzopyran ring is replaced by a 5-membered
tetrahydrofuran ring. As the benzopyran ring is essential for bioactivity,
its replacement may result in loss of bioactivity.

Delta-7-cis-isotetrahydrocannabivarin (Supplement 4-48) has bulky fused cyclohexyl and
cyclopropyl groups that are attached to phenolic OH and C-6 position.
The missing pharmacophore, benzopyran group, and propyl group at C-3
of the phenolic group instead of the pentyl group that reduces the
affinity for the receptor and leads to complete loss of bioactivity.

In O-propyl-cannabidiol (Supplement 4-43), cannabidiol (CBD) (Supplement 4-44), and cannabidiol monomethyl ether (CBDM) (Supplement 4-52), the important pharmacophore benzopyran ring is opened,
and it results in loss of bioactivity.

In the 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-7-hydroxy-a,a-2-trimethyl-9-n-propyl-2,6-methano-2H-1-benzoxocin-5-methanol (Supplement 4-46), the absence of an important pharmacophore benzopyran
ring results in loss of bioactivity. In addition, the pentyl group
at the C-3 position of the phenolic group is replaced by a propyl
group, and it reduces the affinity for the CB1 receptor.

Cannabicyclovarin
(CBLV) (Supplement 4-41) has bulky fused
cyclopentyl and cyclobutyl groups on the benzopyran
ring, it is well tolerated for replacement of the cyclohexene group,
and it has a propyl group at C-3 of the phenolic ring, which reduces
the affinity for the CB1 receptor.

In 3-hydroxy-delta-4,5-cannabichromene
(Supplement 4-45) and 4-acetoxy cannabichromene (Supplement 4-53), the basic cannabichromene has a missing cyclohexene
ring, and the absence of bulky groups at 3, 4 positions in the benzopyran
group makes it biologically inactive. Moreover, in the case of 4-acetoxy
cannabichromene, it can undergo hydrolysis in the stomach giving rise
to a hydrophilic 4-hydroxy phenolic group derivative. The hydroxyl
group in 3-hydroxy-delta-4,5-cannabichromene and post-metabolic 4-acetoxy
cannabichromene may have reduced partition into the membrane for receptor
activation.

In cannabidivarin (Supplement 4-50)
and cannabinodivarin (Supplement 4-49),
the benzopyran ring is opened and it is similar to cannabidiol. The
difference between cannabidivarin and cannabidiol is that the pentyl
group is present at C-3 of the phenolic group in cannabidiol, and
it is replaced by a propyl group in cannabidivarin. Hence, cannabidivarin
is expected to have less affinity for the CB1 receptor than cannabidiol.
Cannabidivarin resembles cannabinol, in which both have benzene rings
instead of the cyclohexene ring. They differ with respect to the benzopyran
and pentyl groups at C-3 of phenolic pharmacophore.

7-R-Cannabicoumarononic acid (Supplement 4-54) has an additional COOH group at position
2 in the phenolic group and the benzopyran ring is replaced by a 5-membered
tetrahydrofuran ring. The introduction of the COOH group at position
2 of the phenolic group decreases the BBB, and the replacement of
benzopyran by a THF ring results in complete loss of bioactivity.

Metabolites Detected in the Cannabis Smoke Activating Other
Receptors
To find the metabolites in cannabis smoke having
the possibility of activating other receptors in the brain, a hierarchical
cluster analysis was performed using the positive reference drugs
and 112 metabolites obtained from MDS analysis. The resulting dendrogram
is presented in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Dendrogram from hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showing 112
metabolites obtained from nonmetric MDS analysis on the ADMET descriptor
of 165 metabolites. (A) Region highly populated with metabolites having
THC-like scaffold. (B) Region with metabolites having no THC-like
scaffold. (C) Endocannabinoids. (D) Region having metabolites with
less populated THC-like scaffold.

The dendrogram shows that there are two major clusters I and II.
Cluster I has 3 subclusters A–C and II has subcluster D. Subcluster
C has all of the endocannabinoids, and they do not cluster with any
reference drugs. The reference drugs clustered with metabolites are
shown in Table 4.

Subcluster A showed
that only one reference drug (P60) clustered
with cannabicoumaronone (C193) and 7-R-cannabicoumarononic
acid (C84). In the subcluster B, ethanol (P18), the most abused addictive
substance matches its physiochemical descriptors with five metabolites,
propofol (C427), thymol (C455), 3-methyl acetophenone (C45), 2-chloroacetophenone
(C19), and cuminaldehyde (C268). Ethanol exerts its neurophysiological
effects through γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors.52 Propofol is an established anesthetic used for
surgical applications.53 Propofol, a well-known
anesthetic used for regular surgeries, interacts with the GABA receptor.54 Carbofuran is the carbamate insecticide used
to control pests that infect C. sativa, and it is shown to bind melatonin and serotonin receptors, which
affect biorthyms55 and metabolic and psychological
processes,56 respectively. Thymol, a natural
monoterpene, is isolated from Thymus vulgaris. Thymol, a monoterpene compound, is found to possess neuroprotective
properties.57 It is used as an antimicrobial
agent58 Thymol has been reported to bind
with GABA receptors on its allosteric site.59 In the case of acetophenone derivatives, the basic acetophenone
scaffold itself is reported to have slight narcotic properties on
smelling its vapors.60 Both 2-chloroacetophenone
and 3-methyl acetophenone have very high predicted blood–brain
barrier values of 0.995 and 0.981, respectively. Combining both high
BBB and basic scaffold acetophenone with narcotic properties, both
the derivatives may have protein targets in the brain and exhibit
psychoactive effects. Cuminaldehyde has a BBB of 0.951, and its parent
compound cumene has a narcotic property and is aproven CNS depressant
and hence the aldehyde derivative of cumene may bind to the GABA receptor
and exhibit psychoactive property. It is very interesting to note
that the correct selection of physiochemical and ADMET descriptors
has enabled us to predict the metabolites from smoke activating GABA/glycine
receptors by comparison with ethanol having no structural homology
with the metabolites.

Tetrahydrozoline is a nasal solution and
highly toxic causing sedation
and muscle weakness on ingestion.61 Tetrahydrofuran
interacts with α-1-adrenoreceptors,62 whereas its reference counterpart nicotine interacts with the nicotine
receptor. Similarly, carbofuran, an insecticide used during horticulture
of the cannabis plant, contaminates the product and is reported to
interact with the melatonin receptor,63 whereas its counterpart reference drugs mescaline and midomafetamine
interact with opioid and serotonin receptors, respectively. Remaining
metabolites are cannabinoids, their scaffold homology with their opioid
reference drug counterparts is much smaller, and their potential of
interaction with opioid receptors is low to consider in this study.

In the identification of psychoactive metabolites from C. sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids,
apart from SAR, there are four control points, which clearly have
deciding factors with the exhibition of psychoactive character for
metabolites. The first control point is the plasma protein binding
(PPB), which controls the quantity of free available metabolite in
serum for biological action. The second control point resides in the
liver and the extent of metabolic changes it undergoes in the liver.
The third control point is at the entry of the blood–brain
barrier and finally its partition coefficient into the membrane to
interact with the receptor. In the case of oral administration of
cannabis products, the second control point is more important than
for the smoking route of inhalation. Some of the metabolites may preserve
the THC scaffold, but the functional group modification may affect
the four control points depending on its polarity. More polar molecules
would have less PPB, high metabolic activity, less BBB, and lower
partition distribution into the membrane. On crossing overall four
control points, the molecule must have functional groups giving rise
to favorable interaction energy with the receptor for optimal binding
and eliciting functional response. The scaffold homology factor calculated
for 54 metabolites may directly correlate with the strength of the
CB1 receptor binding and degree of psychoactive character. Orally
administered cannabis has less psychoactive effects than the smoking
route as the oral route64 produces metabolites
by the action of liver enzymes such as CYP450 and resulting in modification
of the scaffold leading to less psychoactive effects. Preservation
of the cannabinoid scaffold has a much higher probability with the
smoking route than the oral route of administration. Cannabinol and
delta-8-THC are classified as psychoactive,65 and cannabidiol is considered nonpsychoactive in both oral and intravenous
administrative routes. This observation correlates well with scaffold
homology, as delta-8-THC (0.722) and cannabinol (0.63) have higher
scaffold homology than cannabidiol (0.539). The relative proportion
of each metabolite is an important factor in exerting the psychoactive
character, as THC is the only metabolite present in the highest proportion
in C. sativa.65 It will be interesting to test this cannabinoid scaffold homology
factor in ranking the psychoactive character with more in vitro and
in vivo experiments with various proportions or pure substances of
each metabolite. If the cannabinoid scaffold theory is true, the metabolic
engineering on cannabis plant can produce the product rich in metabolites
with more medicinal benefits and less harmful effects of THC in the
future.

Conclusions
Machine learning tools
combined with multivariate methods applied
to physiochemical and ADMET descriptors of metabolites of C. sativa, its smoke, and other phytocannabinoids
lead to the following conclusions. First, computational tools identified
psychoactive metabolites by comparing with agonists of various receptors
such as cannabinoid, opioid, GABA/glycine. Second, this study showed
that scaffold homology of cannabinoids may correlate well with the
degree of psychoactive character. Third, some of the metabolites present
in the smoke such as propofol and thymol have the possibility of interacting
with GABA and glycine receptors. More in vitro and in vivo studies
are required to understand the structural, physiochemical, and clinical
parameters controlling the psychoactive character of cannabinoids
present in C. sativa. Better understanding
will lead to C. sativa plants with
a new set of metabolite matrix having beneficial medicinal properties
in the future.

Experimental Section
Database
The database
containing 468 metabolites was
generated from peer-reviewed articles on chemical constituents of C. sativa. It is comprises phytocannabinoids66−70 and noncannabinoids71 from C. sativa, phytocannabinoids from higher plants,
liverworts, and fungi,72 and volatile compounds
derived from C. sativa.73 Positive controls (74) were Schedule I−IV
substances collected from the Yellow list of narcotic drugs under
International control,74 the endocannabinoid
agonists acting on CB1 and CB2 receptors.75 Eighteen negative controls were the small molecule metabolites found
in the human serum having no psychoactive property. THC was added
to the positive control list, as it is a psychoactive drug representing
the cannabinoid category.

Physiochemical and ADMET Descriptors
For data mining
and multivariate analysis, 32 physiochemical descriptors were calculated
using the CDK molecular descriptor calculator.76 Twenty nine ADMET properties were predicted using the online
platform from ADMETlab based on the comprehensive database of about
300 000 compounds.77 All of the
physiochemical (Supplement 1) and ADMET
descriptors (Supplement 2) of the entire
database are provided in Supplements 1 and 2. Chemical structures of all of the 468 metabolites
are provided in Supplement 3.

Computational
Strategy
The computational strategy for
classification and prediction is outlined in the TOC Figure. Initially,
classification was performed by using four classifiers, namely, naïve-Bayes,
multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor. Open-source application, Weka 3.8.3 from The University
of Waikato, New Zealand, was used for this purpose.78 All of the members of the database were classified as drug
(psychoactive) or no drug (not psychoactive) by all four classifiers
using CDK (purely physiochemical), hybrid CDK–ADMET, and ADMET
(purely predicted clinical descriptors) descriptors separately. Cross-validation
(10-fold) was performed using all four classifiers on the training
set having positive and negative controls under the same testing conditions
for test candidates. The test candidate was classified as a “drug”
when all four classifiers predict the test candidate as a drug for
all three descriptor combinations (CDK, CDK–ADMET, and ADMET).

Detection of Overfitting of Data
To diagnose the overfitting
of data, the training data was divided into 80% training set, 10%
validation set, and 10% test set. All of the training, validation,
and test sets had unique positive and negative controls, and each
set had 6 unique negative controls. Training, validation, and test
sets had 74, 11, and 7 unique candidates, respectively. The test set
was designed to be tough having six negative controls and THC as positive
control where it is only the psychoactive substance in the C. sativa. Training, validation, and test were performed
for CDK, CDK–ADMET, and ADMET data types for all four (NB,
MLP, SVM, and kNN) classifiers.

Nonmetric Multidimensional
Scaling (NM-MDS)
Nonmetric
MDS was executed for each set of 15 metabolites along with 74 reference
drugs using Orange software (version 3.15.0) developed by Bioinformatics
Lab at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, in collaboration with
the open-source community.79

Scaffold Homology
Analysis
Scaffold homology analysis
was performed using the Marvin sketch 18.20 module from ChemAxon software
solutions. The common scaffold of structures free of explicit hydrogen
was compared with THC by 3D alignment option in the accurate mode,
and the resulting pictures were extracted in PNG format.

Cluster Analysis
The final list of 112 predicted drug
candidates was made to go through cluster analysis using CDK descriptor
combinations. From the dendrograms, the predicted drug candidates
clustering with positive controls were analyzed for possible respective
receptor activation.
