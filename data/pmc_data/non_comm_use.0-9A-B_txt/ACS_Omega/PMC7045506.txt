A simple two-step approach has been
employed to synthesize a cobalt–nickel–copper
ternary metal oxide, involving electrochemical precipitation/deposition
followed by calcination. The ternary metal hydroxide gets precipitated/deposited
from a nitrate bath at the cathode in the catholyte chamber of a two-compartment
diaphragm cell at room temperature having a pH ≈ 3. The microstructure
of the ternary hydroxides was modified in situ by two different surfactants
such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide in the bath aiming for enhanced storage performance in the
electrochemical devices. The effect of the surfactant produces a transition
from microspheres to nanosheets, and the effect of micelle concentration
produces nanospheres at a higher ion concentration. The ternary hydroxides
were calcined at 300 °C to obtain the desired ternary mixed oxide
materials as the electrode for hybrid supercapacitors. X-ray diffraction
analysis confirmed the formation of the ternary metal oxide product.
The scanning electron microscopy images associated with energy-dispersive
analysis suggest the formation of a nanostructured porous composite.
Ternary metal oxide in the absence and presence of a surfactant served
as the cathode and activated carbon served as the anode for supercapacitor
application. DTAB-added metal oxide showed 95.1% capacitance retention
after 1000 cycles, achieving 188 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g,
and thereafter stable until 5000 cycles, inferring that more transition
metals in the oxide along with suitable surfactants at an appropriate
micellar concentration may be better for redox reactions and achieving
higher electrical conductivity and smaller charge transfer resistance.
The role of various metal cations and surfactants as additives in
the electrolytic bath has been discussed.

1 Introduction
In the ever-increasing
trend of industrialization, the prevalent
demands and applications of electrochemical energy storage devices
such as batteries and supercapacitors are unavoidable. Day to day
a new quest for an energy material has been showcased that can increase
the utility and capacity of the energy storage devices in a more economic
and ecofriendly way. The performance of energy storage devices is
governed by certain key parameters such as power density, energy density,
specific capacitance, and cycle life stability.1 Typically, supercapacitor electrodes should possess certain
key features such as high power, fast charge–discharge kinetics,
and long cycle life, making it an attractive and most demanding energy
material.2 Amid the two categories of supercapacitors
such as electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and the faradaic
redox reaction pseudocapacitors, the latter one draws much attention
as it offers high capacitance and high energy density than the former.3−9 Asymmetric supercapacitors fall under “faradaic redox pseudocapacitors”
which are in high demand because of their wide electrochemical window
with high specific capacitance possessing a battery-type behavior,
and these key features make them seemly candidates to fulfill the
needs of the incipient energy storage applications in the market.10,11

The specific capacitance basically depends on the choice of
chosen
pseudocapacitive behavior in the nature material or the intrinsic
behavior of the active material. Hence, the selection of an electrode
material should satisfy several parameters including high specific
surface area, nanostructured morphology, controlled porosity, enabling
the system to have improved specific capacitance, high electronic
conductivity, and high power as well as energy density of the capacitor.2,9

Various conducting polymers and metal oxide composites are
well
known candidates for pseudocapacitance behavior that has attracted
researcher’s attention.12,13 However, at present,
the environmental friendly transition-metal oxides such as NiO, Co3O4, and MnO2 have been found to exhibit
superior redox activity with large natural abundance and simplistic
and scalable synthesis delivering high capacitance at a relatively
low cost than conducting polymers and rare earth oxides. Although
Ni, Co, and Mn share common merits, each transition metal oxide differs
in their crystal structures and redox behaviors.14−17 Several limitations such as slow
diffusion rate and low electronic conductivities restrain the materials
from their high performance for supercapacitor applications.18 Considering the above drawbacks, binary or ternary
metal oxides have been proposed, which offer the synergistic effect
of individual metal ions that can ameliorate the capacitive performance
with a widened potential window, superior conductivity, and more active
sites with improved stability.19 Several
works are carried out on binary metal oxides20−27 that were found to exhibit excellent electrochemical performance
over monometallic transition metal oxides due to multiple oxidation
states in the mixed oxide materials.28−30

Although several
studies have been carried out on binary mixed
oxide materials, but only limited works are available on the ternary
oxides (TO). Among the reported data, nanostructured Mn–Ni–Co
oxide,31 Mn–Ni–Co TO nanowires,32 and Zn–Ni–Co TOs18 show much improved capacitance for supercapacitor applications.
On comparing with pure oxide or binary oxides, the TOs showed better
performance in terms of cost and specific capacitance. However, a
facile electrochemical deposition to synthesize TOs is not widely
reported. The synergistic effect consists of high capacity attributed
by Ni leading to improved active site density, conductivity, and roughness,
while the presence of Co leads to increased electronic conductivity,
and the role of Zn is attributed to good electrical conductivity that
results in the overall improvement of the capacitance in the energy
storage device.5,7 Furthermore, TOs offer abundant
structural defects due to the presence of multiphase metal oxides
by several metal ions leading to a stable and improved cycle life.18 On the other hand, in the field of electrodeposition,
it is well known that the nucleation and growth of the crystal structures
of the internal active oxide materials can be altered by various structure-directing
agents/surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),
cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC),33−35 tetraethylammonium bromide,
tetrapropylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide,36 tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide,37 sodium lauryl sulphate,38 and sodium dodecyl sulfate.38 Therefore,
it is imperative to use organic additives as surfactants in the electrolytic
bath to improve the structural and morphological properties of the
oxide deposits. The outcome of these surfactants revealed that they
modified the morphology of the crystals that significantly influenced
the storage property when they were tested as an electrode for energy
storage devices. Still, several surfactants are unexplored in this
field. However, identifying a suitable surfactant for a specific application
(like energy storage), one can achieve an improved storage performance.
To this end, we have adopted this concept and validated the role of
surfactants and the micellar concentration in depositing ternary metal
oxides such as cobalt, nickel, and copper as cations.

In this
work, using a facile electrochemical approach, ternary
metal oxide has been synthesized, and their microstructures are tweaked
with in situ addition of surfactants such as CTAB and dodecyl trimethyl
ammonium bromide (DTAB) at an appropriate amount. In the literature,
the electrochemical synthesis of oxides is predominantly based on
the potentiostatic technique, which are suitable for thin film formation
or obtaining a product in a small scale. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no reported work is yet available on the galvanostatic
technique for synthesizing TO materials and its structural modification
by an in situ addition of the surfactant in the bath. This approach
of electrodeposition can lead to a large-scale production of the requisite
material in a more cost-effective and ecofriendly manner, avoiding
unwanted reactions.

Owing to excellent advantages offered by
ternary metal oxides with
the limited research available in this field, an attempt has been
made to synthesize cobalt–nickel–copper (Co–Ni–Cu)
mixed oxides and modified mixed oxide with surfactants as additives
by a novel galvanostatic technique in a two-step route comprising
electrodeposition followed by calcination. The Ni and Co oxides possess
high redox activity but their capacitance decay could be inevitable
because of their phase transformation during cycling. However, the
addition of Cu may act as a pillaring effect to stabilize the cycling
behavior. To examine this, the obtained TOs are tested as electrodes
for supercapacitor applications, and their capacitance is found to
be enhanced in the presence of DTAB as an additive at critical micelle
concentration (cmc) and above. It has been shown in this work that
the obtained specific capacitance value (188 F/g at 0.1 A/g) for the
modified ternary metal oxide exceeds the previously reported values
for ternary metal oxides,31,32 which is attributed
to the role of additives and CuO.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Preparation of Ternary Metal Hydroxides and
Modified Ternary Metal Hydroxides by Electrodeposition
All
the chemicals used in the present work were of pure analytical grade
and were used as received. Electrodeposition was carried out in a
two-compartment diaphragm cell. Current was supplied from a constant
current dc source (Aplab) in the galvanostatic mode. Details of the
experimental setup was described elsewhere ref (39). Mixed Co–Ni–Cu
ternary hydroxides (TH) were deposited from their nitrate bath containing
30 g dm–3 Co(NO3)2·7H2O + 30 g dm–3 Ni (NO3)2·7H2O with varying concentrations of Cu (NO3)2·3H2O (5, 10, 15 g dm–3) as their respective metal ions. The cathodic reduction of Co2+ to Co(OH)2, Ni2+ to Ni(OH)2, and Cu2+ to Cu(OH)2 were carried out on a
stainless steel cathode placed in parallel to an iridium oxide-coated
titanium (IrO2–Ti) anode at a cathodic current density
of 200 A m–2.

Modified Co–Ni–Cu
hydroxides were synthesized exactly to that of ternary metal hydroxides
from a nitrate bath with fixed a electrolyte concentration of 30 g
dm–3 Co(NO3)2·7H2O + 30 g dm–3 Ni (NO3)2·7H2O + 10 g dm–3 Cu (NO3)2·3H2O but with varying amounts of two
different surfactants, namely, CTAB and DTAB. For cationic surfactants,
such as CTAB and DTAB, pH values of the aqueous solutions are 5.6
and 5.5, respectively. Three sets of experiments were carried out
for each surfactant. Each surfactant were added as per their cmc,
below the cmc, and above the cmc value. The values of the cmc for
CTAB and DTAB are 14.4 and 1 mM, respectively. The below and above
cmc values for CTAB and DTAB are 0.1, 10 and 1.4, 140 mM, respectively.
All the experiments were carried out for 2 h at room temperature.
After which the deposited materials were removed from the cathode
and washed thoroughly with deionized water before drying in an oven.
Subsequently, the dried materials were cooled in a desiccator and
subjected to physical tests such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform
Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), porosity, and other microscopy analyses.

2.2 Calcination of Hydroxide to Form Oxide and
Sample Labelling
THs samples were calcined at 300 °C
for 2 h to convert them to their respective oxides. Then, the calcined
materials were subjected to physical and electrochemical characterization.
Co–Ni–Cu mixed THs deposited from a nitrate bath with
a respective concentration ratio of 30:30:10 (g dm–3), and the corresponding oxides obtained after calcination at 300
°C were labeled as TH and TO, respectively.

The modified
THs deposited from a mixed bath containing CTAB, DTAB at cmc, below
the cmc, and above the cmc are labelled as THCBCMC, THCBLCMC, THCBHCMC, THDBCMC, THDBLCMC, and THDBHCMC. Modified TOs calcined at 300 °C for
CTAB and DTAB at cmc, low cmc, and high cmc are labelled as TOCBCMC, TOCBLCMC, TOCBHCMC, TODBCMC, TODBLCMC, and TODBHCMC respectively.

2.3 Material Characterization
Different
physicochemical characterization was carried out to identify the phase,
bonding, surface morphology, and chemical composition of the THs and
calcined oxide materials. Phase analysis was carried out using a Phillips
powder diffractometer (PANanalytical PW 1830) using Cu Kα radiation.
FT-IR spectroscopic analyses were carried out by using a Nicolet 6070
spectrophotometer at room temperature. The surface morphology of the
samples was determined using scanning electron microscopy (FESEM,
ZEISS SUPRA 55) together with energy dispersive analysis. Nitrogen
adsorption–desorption studies were carried out using Quantachrome
(Autosorb-iQ) surface area and porosity analyzer. Before analyzing,
the samples were degassed at 100 °C overnight. Chemical analysis
was carried out by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) to
determine the composition of the synthesized materials.

2.4 Electrochemical Characterization
The electrodeposited
oxide materials were coated on a graphite substrate
in the area of 1 cm × 1 cm. Graphite was chosen as the substrate
because of its low cost and can be used multiple times. The chosen
substrate was polished with an emery sheet and thoroughly washed with
deionized water and dried before using. The working electrode was
prepared by mixing the active material (metal oxide), carbon black,
and polyvinylidene fluoride in a 75:15:10 wt % ratio. All ingredients
were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (250 μL)
to make a slurry which was coated on a graphite substrate. The coated
electrode was then dried on a hot plate (at 40 °C for an hour)
to evaporate the solvent before any electrochemical testing. The mass
of the coated sample was determined from the weight difference before
and after the coating.

The electrochemical behavior of metal
oxide materials was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and impedance
spectroscopy using an SP-150, Bio-Logic instrument controlled by EC-Lab
software, and galvanostatic charge–discharge and rate capability
measurements by using a battery analyzer (MTI corp, USA) operated
by a battery testing system. Electrochemical behavior of ternary metal
oxides was investigated by using three-electrode cells using 2 M NaOH
as an electrolyte, and Pt wire and Hg/HgO were used as the counter
and reference electrodes, respectively, over a potential range from
0.0 to 0.6 V at different sweep rates. Galvanostatic charge–discharge
in the potential range of 0.2–1.6 V at various current densities.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with
an amplitude of 5 mV over a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz
at open circuit potential. The specific capacitance (Csp), energy density (Esp),
and the power density of the device were calculated using the following
equations 1   2   3  where Csp is the
specific capacitance (F g–1), I is the current (A) imposed to the cell for charge–discharge,
Δt is the time taken to discharge in seconds
(calculated from the discharge curves), m is the
weight of the active electrode (TOCBCMC, TOCBLCMC, TOCBHCMC, TODBCMC, TODBLCMC, and
TODBHCMC) in grams, and ΔE is the
voltage window (E). For a hybrid cell, the two-electrode
configuration, activated carbon is used as the anode with TOCB (or)
TODB as the cathode within the voltage range of 0.0–1.6 V using
2 M NaOH as an electrolyte. The mass of a typical electrode is between
20 and 25 mg. In order to maintain the charge conservation between
the two electrodes, the mass ratio was calculated using eq 4 4  where m represents the mass
in g. Csp– and Csp+ represent the specific capacitance for the ac (125
F/g) and metal oxides (525 F/g), respectively (calculated from eq 1). ΔE– and ΔE+ are the discharge–charge
potential range for the ac and TOCB and TODB electrodes, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Electrodeposition
of Ternary Metal Hydroxide
The present synthesis is based
on electrochemical deposition. In
this work, nitrate solutions of three transition-metal cations such
as Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ at different
concentrations were taken as electrolytes for the synthesis of mixed
TH. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature maintaining
the solution pH at 3 at a current density of 200 A m–2. Generally, mixed hydroxide of cobalt and nickel is deposited from
their mixed nitrate bath at a solution pH of 4.39 However, after mixing copper nitrate to the mixed nitrate
bath of cobalt and nickel, precipitation starts at pH 4; thus the
solution of the ternary metal nitrate electrolyte bath was maintained
at pH 3 before taking it for electrodeposition.

During the electrolysis,
nitrate ions from the bath play a vital role in the deposition of
metal hydroxide such as cobalt hydroxide from cobalt nitrate solution.40 Initially, when potential is applied to the
electrolytic cell, the reduction of nitrate ions take place and hydroxyl
ions are formed. The standard reduction potential (E0) of nitrate ion is −0.31 V versus saturated calomel
electrode. The process during reduction is given as 5  

Hydroxyl groups formed via electrochemical reduction are expected
to react with M2+ ions present in the electrolyte. As a
result, cobalt hydroxide is deposited or electrochemically precipitated
on the substrate according to the reaction in eq 5 6  

Nickel and copper hydroxide are also
deposited in a similar manner 7   8  

In general, the cathodic deposition/precipitation
mechanism from
an electrolyte containing a single metal M with valency m is as follows. 9  

However, if the solution
contains multiple metals such as M1, M2, and
M3 with valances +m, +n, and
+p, respectively, the probable mechanism for electrochemical precipitation/deposition
may be as follows. 10  

The schematic diagram of the probable mechanism of electrochemical
precipitation/deposition TH is shown in Figure 1. The electrodeposited THs samples were calcined
at 300 °C for 2 h to obtain TOs.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the general mechanism
of electrochemical precipitation/deposition
of TH from nitrate bath.

3.2 Physico
Chemical Characterization
To verify the obtained electrodeposited
Co–Ni–Cu mixed
TH and its calcined form, structural elucidation and determination
of the surface morphology of the synthesized materials were carried
out using XRD, FTIR, and FESEM coupled with EDS and BET analyses.
Chemical analysis by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS)
was also carried out to quantify the composition of the material.

3.2.1 XRD Study
Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of the electrodeposited
TH materials from baths containing cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate,
and copper nitrate mixed solution. The diffraction pattern revealed
that in all the cases, the composite of ternary mixed hydroxide was
obtained. The XRD pattern revealed the formation of mixed phases of
Co(OH)2, Ni(OH)2, and Cu(OH)2 with
a hexagonal crystal structure, with reference to JCPDS card nos.:
02-0925, 06-0075, 35-0505. Figure 3 shows the mixed TO phases consisting of cobalt, nickel,
and copper. The XRD pattern of ternary cobalt–nickel–copper
oxide (TO) with diffraction peaks of 32.48, 36.56, 58.49, and 65.05
(JCPDS card no. 80-1537) corresponds to the Co3O4 crystal lattice. However, diffraction peaks at about 43.68 and at
75.15 corresponds to the planes of NiO crystal lattices (JCPDS card
no. 22-1189), and the peaks at ∼35.57, 39.01, 48.65, and 61.67
corresponds to the planes of CuO (JCPDS card no. 05-0661), respectively.
These results suggest that TO comprising of Co–Ni–Cu
contains the phases of Co3O4, NiO, and CuO,
respectively.

3.2.2 FTIR Analysis
FT-IR spectroscopy,
being an important tool for detecting the presence of hydroxyl ions
and water molecules in the electrodeposited samples, was employed
for the analysis of the TH and oxide materials. Figures 4 and 5 show the typical
IR spectra of the THs and oxides, respectively. The presence of OH– groups in Figure 4a implies that water molecules are associated as bound
water within the crystal structure, which is as expected for hydroxide
samples. For the sake of simplicity, only TH samples synthesized at
optimized conditions from an electrolytic bath of 30 g dm–3 Co + 30 g dm–3 Ni + 10 g dm–3 Cu and its corresponding oxide form after calcination at 300 °C
were selected, and the results were compared with the modified samples
having surfactants CTAB and DTAB at the aforesaid optimized conditions.
For all the samples studied, the strong peak observed at 3400–3450
cm–1 are attributed to the stretching vibration
of the O–H group of molecular water and hydrogen-bound O–H
groups.41−44 The weak band at the 1625 cm–1 region is due to
the bending mode of water molecules.45 The
peak present between ∼500 and 600 cm–1 are
described as Ni–O–H and/or Co–OH bending vibration.46 The absorption band at 666 cm–1 can also be ascribed to Co–OH vibrations.47 The spectrum also shows a peak at 1366.58 cm–1 indicating the presence of a Cu–OH bond,48 and the peak at 881.41 cm–1 indicates
Cu–OH vibrations,49,50 indicating the hydroxide
form of transition metal cations.

Figure 5 shows the
FT-IR data of the calcined form of ternary metal hydroxides, which
are TO and TODBCMC. The peak positioned at 3483 and 1637
cm–1 for all the oxide samples are attributed to
the adsorption of water on the surface of pellets because the FTIR
sample were prepared in an ambient atmosphere.51 The shoulder-like peak located at 1318 cm–1 is attributed to the interaction of the synthesized material with
KBr.51 The peak in the regions ∼500–700
cm–1 corresponds to the Co–O and Cu–O
stretching vibration.52 The absorption
bands at 686 and 681 cm–1 are due to Co–O
stretching vibration for the samples in the absence and presence of
DTAB, respectively.53

3.2.3 Surface Morphology and EDS Analysis
The surface morphologies
of the TO and modified TOs (TOCB, TODB)
are shown in Figures 6–8. The SEM images
show significant variation in the surface morphology and orientation
of the crystals depending on the electrolytic bath in the absence
and presence of surfactants and its micellar concentration. The nature
and the concentration of the surfactant influence the microstructure
of the electrodeposited product. Figure 6 shows the typical SEM images of TO at different
magnifications with an energy-dispersive analysis data. The results
revealed that TO showed a hierarchical architecture with microspheres
within the range of 500 nm to 1 μm compactly arranged with no
major detectable voids. However, the corresponding magnified image
shows a porous nature of the material having tiny voids, with a natural
sponge-like interconnected crystallite pores within the crystallite
size of 100–200 nm. This will allow an easy penetration of
ions from the electrolyte, facilitating the versatility of the material
for storing energy reversibly. The relative intensities of the energy-dispersive
spectral (EDS) analysis showed (in Table 2) that the TO material comprises
of an approximately equal metal molar ratio of cobalt to nickel and
copper ions present in the crystal lattice. The quantification of
elements present at detectable concentrations represents 19, 17, and
8% for Co, Ni, and Cu, respectively.

form of ternary metal

The SEM image of TOCBCMC (Figure 7) exhibits a flower-like porous
structure
with an ununiform agglomeration of microspheres within the size ranging
from 1 to 3 μm. At a higher magnification, the individual petals
in the flower-shaped structure shows interconnected pores within the
crystallite size ranging from 200 to 300 nm. A very similar results
has also been observed for another surfactant DTAB, labelled TODBLCMC (shown in Figure 8a,b) and TODB CMC (Figure 8c,d) with a little variation of having a
nanosheet-like orientation and pore structure. TODBLCMC shows more bigger pores than TODBCMC. However, in both
the cases, pores are widely opened than those observed in the TOCBCMC sample (shown in Figure 7). The crystallite size is observed to decrease up
to 100 nm or below in TODBCMC, which increases the porosity
in the material, resulting in better redox behavior of the material
(discussed in the next section), supported by the porosity analysis
in Section 3.2.4. Figure 8e–h
shows the morphology of the TODBHCMC sample, where the
higher concentration of the surfactant resulted in different particle
shapes, more evenly distributed. At higher magnifications (Figure 8g,h), well-connected
hierarchical nanospheres ranging from 200 to 400 nm are obtained with
a less compact arrangement as compared to the TO sample (Figure 6), which may give
more flexibility to the material to avail an easy transport of ions.

3.2.4 Porosity Analysis
To study the
pore-size distribution of ternary metal oxides and modified TOs, nitrogen
adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out. The adsorption–desorption
isotherms and the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore-size distribution curves of TO and the modified TO with
the surfactant DTAB at high cmc (TODBHCMC) are shown in Figure 9a,b. Both the samples
corresponds to the type IV isotherm with a H2-type hysteresis loop,
endorsing the meso porosity of the synthesized materials.54 Sample TO showed the loop shifted to a higher
relative pressure approaching P/P0 = 0.99, suggesting the fact that the number of mesopores
present is higher compared to that of TODBHCMC. However,
the loop of TODBHCMC at lower relative pressure may suggest
the fact that the modified samples contain mesopores along with nanopores.

Figure 9 (a) Nitrogen
adsorption–desorption and (b) pore-size distribution
plots of (i) TO and (ii) TODBHCMC composites.

The BJH pore-size distribution curve showed a significant
difference
between TO and TODBHCMC. Sample TO showed a narrow pore-size
distribution curve with two peaks centered at about ∼3 and
∼4 nm; however, TODBHCMC showed an uniform broaden
pore-size distribution curve with a peak centered at about ∼4
nm suggesting larger pore size with easy transfer of the electrolyte
through the modified TO TODBHCMC. This makes the electrode
feasible to accommodate host ions on the surface of the material.
The mixed nanopores and mesopores in TODBHCMC could reduce
the diffusion distance for the electrolyte ion transport, increase
the surface area, and enhance the adsorption of ions, making it an
excellent material for the plausible electrochemical energy storage
application.55,56

3.2.5 Chemical
Analysis (AAS)
Tables 1 and 2 compare the composition of the
metals present in the sample
Co + Ni + Cu ternary metal hydroxides before (TH) and after (TO) calcination.
The data were obtained by the wet chemical analysis of the electrodeposited
sample using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The result
revealed that with increasing copper concentration in the electrolytic
nitrate bath, the percentage of copper in the uncalcined sample increases
from 8.51 to 28.81% with a significant decrease in cobalt and nickel
concentration. This may be due to more noble copper which get deposited/precipitated
electrochemically faster than cobalt and nickel at it is in a favorable
condition. Therefore, 10 g dm–3 Cu has been used
throughout the studies. Table 2 shows the composition of TO synthesized after the calcination
of TH obtained from the bath of 30 g dm–3, Co +30
g dm–3, and Ni +10 g dm–3 Cu,
which showed that the composition of each metal increases after calcination.

3.3 Electrochemical Characterization
Apart from various metal oxides, carbon materials and conducting
polymers are widely used in electrode fabrication for supercapacitors,
the proposed ternary metal oxides present another alternative. The
electrodes with poor electronic conductivity hamper the fast surface
reaction at the interfaces, particularly for the pseudo-capacitors
with redox-type reactions. Therefore, in the proposed ternary metal
oxide, nickel and cobalt possess high electronic conductivity and
redox behavior, while copper provides structural stability; consequently,
ternary metal oxide is shown to enhance the electrochemical performance
of the electrode. Additionally, the role of surfactants and the micelle
concentrations on the energy storage is reported. Among the samples
tested, TODBHCMC is shown to exhibit high specific capacitance
and low resistance, making it viable to construct supercapacitors
with high energy and power densities. To verify, ternary metal oxides
in the absence and presence of surfactants and the micelle concentration
have been investigated as promising electrode materials.

3.3.1 Ternary Metal Oxides
The electrochemical
capacitance of the ternary metal oxide Co + Ni + Cu (optimal value
of 30:30:10) was determined from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic
(charge–discharge) studies carried out between 0.0 and 0.6
V (for three-electrode configuration) and 0.0–1.6 V (two electrode
configuration) at a specified sweep rates indicated in the figure.
The working electrode (ternary metal oxide) was cycled between 0.0
and 0.6 V at scan rates 2, 5, and 10 mV/s. On each cycle, the potential
started at 0 V, moving initially in the anodic direction to 0.6 V
and then subsequently, reversing it back to the original potential.
Typically, 25 cycles have been performed to activate the material,
and then the data have been collected.

Figure 10a displays the cyclic voltammetric (CV)
profiles under the conditions noted in the figure. As can be seen
in Figure 10a, the
CV profile at a higher scan rate (10 mV/s) is well-defined consisting
of a reduction peak at 0.3 V versus Hg/HgO region and a corresponding
oxidation shoulder-like curve at a potential 0.5 V region. In a fixed
potential window, the oxidation peaks would be incomplete for the
curves scanned at higher sweep rates, implying the potential for this
measurement is not sufficiently positive enough.57 However, there is no clear indication of individual redox
peaks to the respective cations (Co, Ni, and Cu), this could be due
to their redox potentials being close to each other and inseparable.57 The shape of the CV appears like a quasi-rectangular
profile that exhibits near symmetry in shape, suggesting a pseudocapacitor
behavior.39 The corresponding charge–discharge
curves (Figure 10b)
show asymmetric (pseudocapacitive) behavior with near distortions,
exhibiting a charge plateau at 0.5 V versus Hg/HgO and a discharge
plateau-like curve at 0.3 V versus Hg/HgO, indicating that redox reactions
occur.58 The discharge specific capacitances
of the ternary metal oxide corresponds to 185, 175, and 145 F/g at
1, 2 and 5 mA, respectively. The decrease in specific capacitance
with an increasing current rate is due to the limited transfer of
ions to the pores, leading to unused pores of the electrode surface
at 5 mA. However, the achieved high specific capacitance of 185 F/g
is attributed to the porous nature of the microspheres with well interconnected
crystallites (seen in Figure 6c SEM) attributed to the three metals that participated in
the oxide. A hybrid device based on activated carbon as the capacitive
negative electrode and ternary metal oxide as the pseudocapacitive
positive electrode was made. The optimized potential window for the
hybrid device was determined by measuring the suitable potential window
for the positive electrode studied by three-electrode system in Figure 10a,b, which is 0.6
V. For the negative electrode (activated carbon) as reported by us
earlier,39 the operating voltage is 1.0
V, which is totally comprising 1.6 V. The CV curves (Figure 10c) exhibited a capacitor-like
behavior while maintaining the shape with no distortion but the area
under the curve (i.e. current response) increases on the higher sweep
rates. In addition, the charge–discharge curves (Figure 10d) show a highly
symmetric shape, suggesting a high reversibility. The hybrid device
shows a specific capacitance of 145, 103, and 85 F/g at the discharge
current of 1, 3, and 5 mA, respectively.

(CV) curves and (b) charge–discharge
behavior of ternary metal oxides (unmodified) in three-electrode configuration.
Panels (c,d) are in two-electrode (hybrid cell) configuration. Sweep
rates (mV/s) and charge–discharge current (mA) are shown in
respective figures. The respective current densities are 0.03, 0.05,
and 0.15 A/g.

3.3.2 Modified
Ternary Metal Oxides
To
achieve one of another objectives, such as to enhance the faradaic
reactions and attain better specific capacitance, ternary metal oxides
in the presence of various surfactants with different micellar concentrations
are tested. The presence of transition elements along with surfactants
is expected to increase the capacitive behavior due to redox reactions.
This is mainly because the obtained morphology for these samples is
shown to play significant roles on the electrocapacitive performance
of the electrodes.

The CV curves for the CTAB surfactant at
the cmc level (shown in Figure 11a) indicate faradaic behavior within the voltage window
tested, and the shape of the curves is like those of unmodified ternary
metal oxide (in Figure 10a,b). However, the area under the curve is different, implying
that more redox reaction occurred for the CTAB-modified sample. The
corresponding charge–discharge curves (Figure 11b) show asymmetric (pseudocapacitive) behavior
with near distortions and remain almost unchanged to that observed
for the unmodified sample. Notably, the specific capacitance of the
CTAB-modified sample delivered higher specific capacitance of 340,
235, and 210 mA h/g at a current density of 1, 3, and 5 mA, respectively.
The obtained values are about two times higher than that of the performance
shown in Figure 10. The modified ternary metal oxide presents a well-defined bent sheet-like
structure grown in a random direction relating to the enhanced performance.
A hybrid device performance constituting an activated carbon coupled
with modified ternary metal oxide is shown in Figure 11c. The CV curves of the electrodes in Figure 11c show a potential
of 1.6 V at sweep rates from 2 to 10 mV/s. It is found that the CV
profiles are well maintained, indicating the high transport rate of
electrons and its corresponding charge–discharge curves (Figure 11d) show 180, 122,
116 F/g at a current of 1, 3, and 5 mA revealing an excellent rate
capability. The addition of CTAB amphiphilic surfactant composed of
positively charged head and carbon tail acts as crystal growth modifiers33,59 and their cmc level was vital for the formation of the obtained
deposits.

Figure 11 (a) Cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves and (b) charge–discharge
behavior of modified ternary metal oxides (CTAB cmc) in three-electrode
configuration. Panels (c,d) are in two-electrode (hybrid cell) configuration.
Sweep rates (mV/s) and charge–discharge current (mA) are shown
in respective figures. CTAB at a cmc is termed as “CTAB cmc”.
The respective current densities are 0.03, 0.05, and 0.15 A/g.

To gain more insights, another cationic surfactant
with a less
hydrophobic chain, DTAB has been examined. A modified ternary metal
oxide synthesized in the presence of a DTAB surfactant at three different
micellar concentrations (below the cmc, cmc, and above the cmc level)
had been used as an electrode and tested in a three-cell configuration.
Obviously, the CV curves for the DTAB high micellar concentration
(DTABHCMC) showed a very well-defined peaks with larger
integrated area becoming more prominent at higher sweep rates from
5 to 10 mV/s, as shown in Figure 12a–c. The corresponding symmetric shape of the
charge–discharge without any distortions (Figure 12d–f) relates to a maximum
specific capacitances 525, 475, 455 F/g at a discharge current of
1, 2, and 5 mA. Both the CV and CD curves (Figure 12a–f) clearly show that using DTAB
as a surfactant improves the capacitance compared to the unmodified
and CTAB surfactant material, with the high cmc addition (Figure 12c,f) achieving
the maximum discharge capacitance. When an increasing amount of DTAB
is used in the electrolytic bath during electrodeposition, the areas
under the peaks are larger for the high cmc than the low cmc (Figure 12a,d) and cmc levels
(Figure 12b,e). The
higher amount of the surfactant may reduce the surface tension of
the cathode during electrodeposition, which inhibits the formation
of hydrogen in the bath and enhanced the quality of the ternary metal
oxide deposits. This illustrates that the hierarchical nanosphere
like the microstructure is formed (as shown in Figure 8) that can accelerate the electron transport
and contribute to the formation of multiple active sites during the
electrochemical reaction process, resulting in improved performance
of energy storage. For hybrid device performance, activated carbon
coupled with modified ternary metal oxide, remarkably, the integrated
area of the CV curves (shown in Figure 12h,k) for the DTABHCMC is larger
and near rectangular in shape than that of DTABCMC, indicating
a higher specific capacity for the former. This effect is clearly
identified by increasing the amount of added DTAB in the bath which
produces a better leveling effect at the electrodeposited surface.
Moreover, the Nyquist plots for the modified TO material is shown
in Figure 12i. The
addition of DTAB in the modified oxide reduced the solution resistance
(Rs) two times, not only that but also
attained the smallest charge transfer resistance (Rct) value of about 0.5 Ω. This result suggests that
the DTABHCMC material enhanced the electrical conductivity
for the electrode, and Rct is related
to the unique hierarchical morphology of the oxide material. The charge–discharging
behaviors of the modified TOs (Figure 12j,k) exhibit symmetrical and nearly linear
characteristics, implying a capacitor nature. Indeed, the CV (Figure 12g,h) and CD (Figure 12j,k) curves (in
a two-electrode system; hybrid cell) for DTABHCMC further
confirm that the voltage window of 1.6 V is safe and delivered a maximum
capacitance of 188, 157, and 145 F/g at a current density of 0.03,
0.05, and 0.15 A/g. The hybrid device indicates 95.2% retention of
the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles delivering 179 F/g, as shown
in Figure 12l. Interestingly,
after 5000 consecutive cycles, the capacitance retention remains 98%
delivering 177 F/g. The role of Cu in the electrodeposited ternary
metal oxide provides an excellent cycling stability of the electrode.
However, an initial increase and then decrease in capacitance could
be attributed to the activation process of the TO electrode during
the initial cycles. The electrochemical performance of the ternary
metal oxide reported in this work compares well and exceed the values
to similar materials reported in the literature such as Co3O4 (57 F/g),60 NiCo2O4 (64 F/g),61 Co–Ni
oxides (82 F/g),62 Ni0.8Mn0.2Fe2O4 (147 F/g),63 NiMoO4 (100 F/g),64 and other ternary metal oxides.57 The
obtained specific capacitance value (188 F/g at 0.1 A/g) for the modified
ternary metal oxide exceeds the previously reported values for ternary
metal oxide ZNCO18 and MNCO.32 This is shown to be attributed to the role of
surfactants at the appropriate concentration. Furthermore, we have
summarized the supercapacitor materials with the synthesis techniques
employed, and the obtained storage performance has been compared with
reference to our current work. The performances are shown in Table 3. Energy density and
power density parameters are shown through the Ragone plot of the
hybrid cell based on a two-electrode configuration in Figure 13. The performance data of
the available capacitors in the market and few typical examples reported
recently in the literature were also provided for comparison. The
hybrid cell of the ternary metal oxide shows a maximum energy density
of 61.6 W h/kg at 200 W/kg. With the power density increasing to 1500
W/kg, an energy density of 10 W h/kg can be maintained. These results
confirm the electrochemical synthesis of ternary metal oxides and
its role of surfactants and the CuO on the energy storage device.
Overall, the obtained performance of this ternary metal oxide is higher
than those of EDLC and Na-ion based symmetrical supercapacitors and
comparable to that of asymmetrical supercapacitors previously reported.37,65−69

4 Conclusions
Facile
synthesis of a ternary metal oxide, Co–Ni–Cu
mixed oxide, is achieved by the electrodeposition/electrochemical
precipitation technique using a diaphragm cell comprising a nitrate
bath with a pH of ∼3 of the mixed electrolyte, followed by
calcination at 300 °C. The in situ effect of two different surfactants
CTAB and DTAB at various concentrations on the surface morphology,
crystal structure, and the electrochemical performance of the synthesized
materials for energy storage devices was investigated. The ternary
metal oxide electrodes showed significant differences in the morphologies
in the absence and presence of surfactants in the bath, which played
a crucial role in determining the overall capacitive behaviors. The
nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm and pore size analysis provides
strong evidence about the porous nature of the materials. The contributions
of ternary metal oxide in the presence of a surfactant at a suitable
micellar concentration on the electrocapacitive ability have never
been discussed earlier. Among the samples studied, DTABHCMC showed the maximum specific capacitance 188 F/g at a current density
0.1 A/g with a capacitance retention of 95% after 1000 cycles. The
available capacitance was found to be stable thereafter until 5000
cycles. Choosing suitable metals and amount of surfactants to incorporate
in the oxide through facile electrochemical synthesis is thus of a
great importance to attain efficient energy storage with a high capacitance
retention.
