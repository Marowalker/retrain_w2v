Because of their
large surface area and conductivity, some inorganic
materials have emerged as good candidates for the trace-level detection
of pharmaceutical drugs. In the present work, we demonstrate the detection
of an anticancer drug (regorafenib, REG) by using an electrochemical
sensor based on a nanocomposite material. We synthesized a zirconia-nanoparticle-decorated
reduced graphene oxide composite (ZrO2/rGO) using a one-pot
hydrothermal method. Reduction of the graphene oxide supports of the
Zr2+ ions with hydrazine hydrate helped in preventing the
agglomeration of the zirconia nanoparticles and in obtaining an excellent
electrocatalytic response of the nanostructure ZrO2/rGO-based
electrochemical sensor. Structural and morphological characterization
of the nanostructure ZrO2/rGO was performed using various
analytical methods. A novel regorafenib (REG) electrochemical sensor
was fabricated by immobilizing the as-prepared nanostructure ZrO2/rGO on to a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The resulting
ZrO2/rGO/GCE could be used for the rapid and selective
determination of REG in the presence of ascorbic acid and uric acid.
The ZrO2/rGO/GCE showed a linear response for the REG analysis
in the dynamic range 11–343 nM, with a remarkable lower detection
limit and limit of quantifications of 17 and 59 nM, respectively.
The newly developed sensor was used for the accurate determination
of REG in both serum samples and pharmaceutical formulations, with
satisfactory results.

==== Body
Introduction
Regorafenib [4-(4-(3-(4-chloro-3-(trifluromethyl)
phenyl)-3-flurophenoxy)-N-ethylpicolinamide] (BAY
73-4506) is an orally bioavailable
multikinase inhibitor (MKI), which also obstructs multiple tumor pathways,
inhibiting targets in the receptors of the vascular endothelial growth
factor 1–3 (VEGF 1–3), fibroblast growth factor, and
platelet-derived growth factor, including the mutant oncogenic kinesis
c-KIT, RET, and B-RAF.1,2 This MKI generates dynamic metabolites,
which could become agglomerated, particularly in elderly, malnourished
patients or in patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma, as in
the case of other MKIs.3 Oral drugs present
high protein binding and poor bioavailability and are effectively
metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 in the liver.4,5 Regorafenib
(REG), being orally administrated, may lead to drug interactions and
major toxicities that may lead to early termination of the treatment
and thus diminish its chances of success. It is important to maintain
the benefits of these treatments, particularly in the elderly or in
patients treated for metastatic colon cancer and gastrointestinal
tumors, which is approved by FDA.6−11 The most serious adverse reaction was drug-induced hepatotoxicity,
and a black box warning has been indicated by the US-FDA.12 Thus, the detection of this anticancer active
drug is extensively important and a universal challenge. Some of the
sophisticated analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC),13 liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS),14−19 and spectrophotometry20 are used for
the detection of REG in urine, plasma, and other biological samples.
However, the aforementioned methods are highly expensive, time-consuming,
difficult procedures and require skilled personnel for the specimen,
which restricts their particle application. To mitigate these issues,
as revealed earlier, much effort has been made to develop novel substituted
methods. In this concern, the electrochemical technique is one of
the best methods due to its easy operation, spontaneous detection,
excellent sensitivity, inexpensiveness, simple pretreatment procedure,
and short analysis time for monitoring of bioelectroactive molecules
and pharmaceutical drugs. However, for the detection of bioelectroactive
molecules, these electrochemical methods have some analytical complications
like high overpotential requirement, the reversible process at the
bare and carbon paste electrode, GCE, and by-products that may be
deposited on the electrode surface, which decrease its activity. Nevertheless,
a familiar approach to triumph over these issues is electrodes’
surface modification with various materials, like polymers,21−23 carbon materials, and metal-oxide nanoparticles.24−27

For the last few decades,
graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) have received significant interest owing to their excellent
properties in electrochemical applications, such as good electric
conductivity, large surface area, high chemical activity, and wide
electrochemical window.28,29 Moreover, chemically,
rGO is established as a promising supporting material for the uniform
distribution of metal-oxide NPs.30−34

In recent years, various metal-oxide-doped
graphene oxide composites
have been widely used in electrochemical devices and electrocatalysis.
Metal oxides, particularly, transition-metal oxides have various physicochemical
properties, such as morphological structure, oxygen stoichiometry,
good electrochemical conductivity, and interfacial microenvironment
of the reaction. Among the transition-metal oxides, zirconium oxide
nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs) show excellent electrochemical
properties, including nontoxicity, thermal stability, wide band gap,
and good electrical and surface properties and are one of the most
abundant metals.35,36 A critical issue in utilizing
bare ZrO2 nanoparticles is that they tend to aggregate
and form large clusters during their synthesis.37,38 In this connection, rGO is an excellent material to mitigate the
agglomeration of ZrO2 NPs and subsequently enhance the
electrochemical properties. Therefore, researchers have been giving
dedicated extensive efforts to synthesize and explore ZrO2 decorated on rGO sheets, for example, Pt/ZrO2-RGO/GCE
for significant enhancement of the catechol and hydroquinone oxidation,39 ZrO2/rGO-based biosensor for detection
of the oral cancer drug,40 and Meth/ZrO2/rGO-based immunosensor.41

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of electrochemical
REG sensing in human blood serum and pharmaceutical formulations using
ZrO2/rGO/GCE. In this work, we tried to validate such a
voltammetric sensor for the detection of REG. The prepared ZrO2/rGO/GCE can resolve overlapping signals from REG, uric acid
(UA), and ascorbic acid (AA). In addition, the present work showed
that this sensor possesses an excellent linear dynamic range (LDR)
and limit of detection (LOD) for the novel REG determination (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
ZrO2/rGO Nanocomposite for the Electrochemical
Sensing of REG
Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the ZrO2/rGO Nanocomposite
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM),
and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses were conducted
to examine the morphology and structure of the synthesized nanocomposite.
The TEM images of the pristine ZrO2, GO, and ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite are shown in Figure 1. Pristine ZrO2 nanoparticles
(Figure 1a) are nearly
spherical with a uniform size of size of 6–9 nm, which is in
good agreement with the calculated values based on the powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) result. Moreover, the displaced-lattice spacing
of 0.291 nm, determined from the HRTEM images (blue circles in Figure 1b) is consistent
with the (111) plane of ZrO2. The pristine GO nanosheets
are highly wrinkled, and the ZrO2 nanoparticles (blue circles)
are well decorated and uniformly distributed on the surface of the
wrinkled rGO (Figure 1d–f). The SAED patterns for ZrO2 (Figure 1c) and the ZrO2/rGO
nanocomposite shown in Figure 1f (inset) illustrate the crystalline dots instead of amorphous
rings, which indicate the polycrystalline nature of the ZrO2 nanoparticles and nanocomposite. To further confirm the formation
of the nanocomposition, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
analysis was employed. The presence of carbon, zirconium, and oxygen
elements confirms the presence of ZrO2 on to the GO surface
(Figure S3).

Figure 1 TEM, HRTEM, and SAED
images of (a–c) pristine ZrO2 and (d–f) ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite.

The phase purities of the as-synthesized GO and the ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite were examined using PXRD. Figure S4a shows a diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.7°,
corresponding to the (001) planes of GO. The peaks of the ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite, in Figure S4b, show the existence of both tetragonal and monoclinic mixed phases,
which coincide with the standard cards (JCPDS card nos. 49-1642 and
37-1484, respectively) and also show that the peak at 2θ = 10.7°,
in Figure S4a, has shifted to 22.4°
(002), indicating that GO has been reduced after treating it with
the ZrO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the particle size
of the ZrO2 nanoparticles was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer
equation (D = 0.89λ/β cos θ),
where D, λ, β, and θ are the average
particle size, wavelength of the Cu Kα irradiation, intensity
at the full width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak, and diffraction
angle of the (111). The average particle size of pristine ZrO2 is about 7 nm, in good agreement with the TEM result. These
results clearly confirm the formation of the ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the GO and ZrO2/rGO samples were recorded at wave numbers 500–4000
cm–1. Pristine GO has a large number of surface
functional groups, as shown in Figure S5a, such as O–H, C=O, C=C, and C–O, which
are confirmed by the IR bands at 3320, 1700, 1604, and 1009 cm–1, respectively. In the ZrO2/rGO sample
shown in Figure S5b, the hydroxyl, carbonyl
and epoxide functional groups had disappeared and also overall peak
intensities decreased significantly, which confirm reduction of pristine
GO leads to the formation of ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite.

The chemical composition was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectrometry (XPS). The wide-survey scan spectrum of the ZrO2-doped rGO nanocomposite (ZrO2/rGO) is shown in Figure S6. The major peaks at 182.5, 284.9, and
530.2 eV are attributed to Zr 4p, C 1s, and O 1s, respectively. In
addition, the peaks at 27, 333, and 433 eV attributed to Zr 4p, Zr
3p, and Zr 3s, respectively. The deconvolution spectrum of the Zr
3d peak, Figure S6 (inset), shows binding
energies at 182.4 and 184.9 eV attributed to Zr 3d5/2 and
Zr 3d3/2, respectively, which can be assigned to the Zr(IV)
oxidation state. On the basis of these results, we confirmed that
ZrO2 is well embedded into the wrinkled rGO.

Electrochemical
Behavior of REG
Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms for the electrocatalytic
oxidation of REG on the bare and modified GCE electrodes, recorded
in the supporting electrolyte solution (phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) 0.1 M, pH 7.0) in the presence of 0.01 mM REG at 50 mV s–1. The voltammograms recorded on the bare GCE in the
absence of REG did not show any redox peaks (Figure 2a), indicating that no faradic reactions
occurred on the surface of the unmodified GCE electrode. Figure 2b shows that the
addition of 0.01 mM REG to the supporting electrolyte solution results
in the GCE exhibiting a lowest sensitivity reversible couple peak
of high separation; ΔEp = 208 mV,
which suggests a slow electron transfer. Figure 2c,d shows the recognizable electrochemical
response of the ZrO2/GCE and ZrO2/rGO/GCE, respectively,
during the oxidation of 0.01 mM REG, which is interpreted as a result
of the enhanced sensitivity, electrode surface area, and improvement
of the electrochemical activity of the GO support with ZrO2 NPs. Figure 2d shows
the ZrO2/rGO/GCE and reveals well-defined reversible couple
peaks at about Epa = 275 mV and Epc = 306 mV, attributed to the high catalytic
effect during the oxidation of 0.1 mM REG. The ZrO2/rGO/GCE
remarkably improved the reversible couple peaks and it should be emphasized
that the peak-to-peak separation, that is ΔEp, decreased to 31 mV. Finally, the results confirmed
that the prepared ZrO2/rGO/GCE significantly improves the
electrocatalytic ability to oxidize REG.

(d) ZrO2/rGO/GCE in the presence of 0.01 mM REG.

Effect of pH
The
significant effects of the electrolyte
pH on the determination of REG by electrocatalysis of ZrO2/rGO/GCE were studied for both current and potential. Figure 3 shows the effect of different
pH values, in the range 5.5–8.0, investigated by differential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) in a 0.01 mM REG solution and the relationship
between Ipa and Epa (anionic peak current and potential, respectively) with
the buffer pH. Figure 3b shows that the anodic peak current of the REG electro-oxidation
increases until the pH value becomes 7.0 and then decreases until
the end of the experiment (pH 8.0). For this reason, the electrolytic
solution with pH 7.0 was chosen for the complete electrocatalytic
study. Figure 3b also
shows that the formal REG potential shifts toward lower values with
the increase in the supporting electrolytic solution. A better correlation
coefficient was obtained for the pH vs Epa, which was confirmed by a slope of 0.053 09 V/pH (R2 = 0.9621), in the range 5.5–8.0. According
to the linear regression analysis, the slope of the dEp/dpH being close to the theoretical value of 0.059 V/pH
indicates that the irreversible couple peaks involved the transfer
of the same number of electrons and protons,42 in agreement with literature data.43 The
ZrO2/rGO/GCE responds to the oxidation of REG according
to the mechanism presented in Scheme 2. Thus, REG-keto oxidizes to REG-enol (the amide derivative)
after an exchange of one electron and one proton via ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite.36

mV s–1.

Scheme 2 Electrochemical Redox Process of REG by ZrO2/rGO/GCE
Influence of the Scan Rate
Figure 4a shows
the influence of the scan rate, from
10 to 100 mV s–1, on the cyclic voltammetry (CV)
peak potential and current of 0.01 mM REG in the presence of 0.1 M
PBS, pH 7.0, at the ZrO2/rGO/GCE. The REG reversible couple
peak current increases gradually with an increase in the scan rate.
In addition, the REG oxidation and reduction peak currents (Ipa and Ipc) showed
good linear correlation coefficients (R2) as a function of the square root of the scan rates of the anodic
and cathodic peaks with 10–100 mV s–1 changing
scan rates (Figure 4b), obeying the following linear regression equations    These results indicate that the electrochemical
reactions of REG on the ZrO2/rGO/GCE are diffusion-controlled
processes. The estimation of the REG electrochemical parameters, at
different scan rates, was made with Laviron’s eqs 1–3.44 1   2   3  where α is the electron transfer coefficient
(0.76), n is the number of electrons, F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C mol–1), R and T are the universal gas
constant and temperature (K), respectively, and ks is the standard heterogeneous rate constant (1.18) determining
the slowest step of the REG electrochemical oxidation.

peak currents versus the square root of the scan rate, during the

Analytical Performance
of ZrO2/rGO/GCE for REG Detection
The ZrO2/rGO/GCE was tested by differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV), to investigate the sensitivity of its response to various REG
concentrations in the linear dynamic range of 11–343 nM REG
in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0, at pulse height 60, pulse width 10, and scan
rate 100 mV s–1, as shown in Figure 5a. The intensity of the anodic peak current
increased with the REG concentration. Figure 5b shows the linear dynamic-range plotting
of the anodic peak current (Ipa) versus
the REG concentrations and its linear regression equation Ipa = 9.4911(REG) + 3.434, (R2 = 0.9963). The limits of detection and quantification
can be calculated according to eqs 4 and 5(45,46) 4   5  where SD is the standard deviation
and B is the slope of the calibration plot. From
the calibration
plot, a detection limit of 11 nM and quantification limit of 59 nM
were calculated, on the basis of S/N = 3 (signal to noise). These
results confirmed that the ZrO2/rGO/GCE is a promising
platform for the electrochemical determination of ultratrace of REG
concentration.

Simultaneous Detection of REG, AA, and UA by ZrO2/rGO/GCE
The main objective of this study was sensing of
REG, AA, and UA in a mixture. REG, AA, and UA mixture solution with
different concentrations in 0.1 M PBS with pH 7 was prepared. DPV
result for the simultaneous detection of REG, AA, and UA is presented
in Figure 6. The oxidation
peak current increased synchronously on increasing the concentration
of REG, AA, and UA. The DPV signal shows the linear relationship between
the oxidation peak current and REG concentrations (Figure 6 inset) with LDR 0.32–0.66
μM and the linear regression equation as follows: Ipa (μA) = 15.46CREG +
0.5232 (μM) (R2 = 0.9943). The oxidation
current increased parallel AA and UA concentrations with LDRs 0.58–1.26
and 0.08–0.52 μM, respectively, and the linear regression
equations as follows: Ipa (μA) =
3.92CAA + 2.417 (μM) (R2 = 0.9749) and Ipa (μA)
= 15.85CUA + 4.97 (μM) (R2 = 0.9795). This result indicated that the
proposed electrochemical sensor enables the synergetic and sensitive
detection of REG in the presence of AA and UA without significant
interference from each other.

determination of 0.32–0.66 μM REG, 0.58–1.26 μM
AA, and 0.08–0.52 μM UA in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0. Insets:
plots of the anodic peak currents against concentrations of REG, AA,
and UA.

Effect of Interference
Compounds
The effect of interferences
for the determination of REG, AA, and UA mixture solution was investigated
in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) electrolyte solution in the presence of a possible
interfering factor such as metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+), glutathione, folic acid, or l-cysteine.
The observed results are summarized in Table S1. No significant signal intensity change (less than 5% difference
from their original signal intensity) was observed in the presence
of interfering ions and molecules. The results indicate that the designed
ZrO2/rGO/GCE displays good ability for simultaneous sensing
of AA, UA, and REG in a matrix mixture, without any interference of
the above-mentioned species.

Real-Sample Analysis
The real-sample
monitoring of
the performance of the ZrO2/rGO/GCE was validated by the
DPV determination of REG in human blood serum samples. To determine
the accuracy of the results, 1.0 mL human blood serum samples were
diluted 50 times with PBS to prevent the matrix effects of analytical
determinations. The human blood serum samples were centrifuged before
the measurements; the results are summarized in Table 1. The recovery rates for the different volumes
of the samples ranged between 96.5 and 101.9% and the relative standard
deviations were in the range 0.3–2.4%, showing the accuracy
and efficiency of the constructed electrochemical sensor. Therefore,
the ZrO2/rGO/GCE can be applied to real bioclinical samples.

Comparison with Other Established Methods
The sensitivity
of the developed electroanalytical method was compared to that of
some of the chromatography and spectrophotometry methods. Recently,
Fujita et al., reported one method using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) for simultaneous quantitative determination of REG in the human
plasma and achieved LOQ of 10 ng mL–1. In addition,
Erp et al., reported liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) can achieve LOQ of 100 ng mL–1 for REG.
The other spectroscopic method can analyze REG with an LOQ of 290
ng mL–1. Compared with the reported methods, the
presented method shows a better limit of detection and limit of quantification
limit (Table 2). Due
to its low cost, simplicity, high sensitivity, and rapid analysis
time, the presented method has advantages over the other analytical
methods.

Conclusions
Inorganic metal-oxide nanoparticles have been enormously employed
as electrode material for a developed efficient electrochemical sensor.
A simple one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite
was successfully synthesized. The pristine ZrO2 nanoparticles
are about 7 nm and uniformly dispersed on the reduced graphene oxide
sheet. Due to reduced graphene oxide support, the ZrO2 metal-oxide
nanoparticles illustrate excellent electrocatalytic performance toward
REG anticancer drug. The developed ZrO2/rGO nanocomposite
was characterized by TEM, EDX, PXRD, FT-IR, and XPS measurements.
TEM images clearly show the zirconia nanoparticles have uniform size
and uniform distribution on the surface of rGO. The inorganic nanocomposite-based
electrochemical sensor was successfully applied first time for the
detection of REG anticancer drug. The fabricated ZrO2/rGO
nanocomposite exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity toward
REG, with a linear dynamic range of 11–343 nM and the detection
limit as low as 17 nM toward the detection of REG drug. The ZrO2/rGO/GCE was applicable for the joint determination of REG
and a commonly reported interference AA and UA at pH 7.0. The calculated
LOD/LOQ values by the present electrochemical method are better than
those from chromatography and spectrophotometry methods. This electrochemical
sensor shows promise for future exploration of rapid detection of
other anticancer drugs in human blood serum and pharmaceutical formulation.

Experimental
Section
Modification of the Glassy Carbon Electrode
Preparation
of the ZrO2/rGO/GCE: prior to use, the bare GCE was polished
with alumina powder (1, 0.3, and 0.05 μm) and washed with an
ethanol solution, followed by Millipore water under ultrasonication.
For the preparation of the electrochemical sensor, 3 mg of the prepared
ZrO2/rGO was dispersed in 3 mL of Millipore water with
0.3 mL of Nafion solution and then ultrasonicated for 30 min until
a uniformly dispersed ink was obtained. The ZrO2/rGO ink
(7 μL) was drop cast onto the clean GCE surface and allowed
to dry for 15 min at room temperature. The ZrO2/GCE was
fabricated in a similar manner.

Reproducibility and Stability
of the Modified Electrode
Reproducibility and stability are
key elements for electrode performance.
To evaluate the reproducibility of the ZrO2/rGO/GCE, we
made five sensing electrodes and used them to investigate their CV
current response on 1 μM REG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
pH 7.0, as shown in Figure S1a. The calibrated
histograms in Figure S1b show a relatively
standard deviation (RSD) of 0.54%. The repeatability of the modified
electrochemical sensor values was obtained for the detection of 1
μM REG in presence of the supporting electrolyte, PBS (pH 7.0).
The ZrO2/rGO/GCE average voltammetric response for seven
successive determinations was 3.34% (Figure S2a). Moreover, the stability of the ZrO2/rGO/GCE was verified
by the daily detection for 7 weeks of 1 μM REG solution in presence
of the supporting PBS electrolyte (pH 7.0). After each test of stability,
the electrode was washed with deionized water, dried under an argon
stream, and kept in empty glass tubes at room temperature. The electrochemical
oxidation of the 1 μM REG solution, in presence of the supporting
PBS electrolyte (pH 7.0), using the ZrO2/rGO/GCE diminished
by about 9.6% of their initial response during the 7 weeks, as shown
in Figure S2b. Hence, the proposed method
and the modified electrochemical sensor determined REG with higher
reproducibility and stability than the ZrO2/GCE sensor.

Preparation of Real Samples for Analysis
A powdered
Stivarga tablet (Nexus Lifecare Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) containing
40 mg of REG was dissolved by ultrasonication in 25 mL of 0.1 M PBS
buffer solution at pH 7.0. This solution was filtered and quantitatively
diluted with buffer solution to get 0.1 mM REG solution that was used
for the analyses. Fresh human blood serum samples were collected from
healthy volunteers (S. V. University Health Center, S. V. University,
Tirupati, India). Approximately, 2.0 mL of human blood serum was diluted
with 100 mL of 0.1 M PBS, at pH 7.0, and the solution thus prepared
was used for analysis, without any further treatment.
