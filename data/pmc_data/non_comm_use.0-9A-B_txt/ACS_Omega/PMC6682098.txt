Accurate
depiction of the adsorption capacity of supercritical
CO2 (ScCO2) by existing adsorption models is
an important focus for deep coal seams in CO2-enhanced
coalbed methane (CO2-ECBM) recovery. To investigate the
applicability of different adsorption models for the adsorption isotherms
of ScCO2, the validities of 10 different adsorption models
were analyzed, based on analyses of the adsorption characteristics
of ScCO2 from deep coal seams of the Southern Qinshui Basin,
China. These models include the Langmuir (L) model, two-parameter
Langmuir (TL) model, Toth (T) model, Langmuir–Freundlich (LF)
model, extended Langmuir (EL) model, double parameter Brunauer–Emmett
Teller model, three-parameter BET (TBET) model, Dubinin–Radushkevich
(D–R) model, Dubinin–Astakhov (D–A) model, and
Ono–Kondo lattice (OK) model. These models were tested for
both the excess and absolute adsorption capacities of ScCO2 under various temperatures and pressures. The simulation accuracy
of the different adsorption models was analyzed. The optimal models
for the adsorption of ScCO2 in deep coal seams were selected
based on a comprehensive analysis of the simulation parameters, standard
error, and residual sum of squares. There were obvious differences
in the validity of the different adsorption models in terms of the
excess adsorption capacity and absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2. The D–A and D–R models are the optimal adsorption
models for the adsorption isotherms of the excess adsorption of ScCO2 for the whole tested pressure range. The T, TL, and D–R
models are the optimal adsorption models in simulation of the excess
adsorption capacity of ScCO2 for the selected adsorption
models when the equilibrium pressure is divided into two sections
at the point of 8.13 MPa. In simulation of the absolute adsorption
capacity of ScCO2, the TBET and LF models are the optimal
adsorption models among the selected models when the equilibrium pressure
is less than or equal to 8.13 MPa. The linear, exponential, logarithmic,
power function, and polynomial adsorption simulation all have good
precision in the simulation of the absolute adsorption capacity of
ScCO2 when the pressure is beyond 8.13 MPa.

1 Introduction
Deep coalbed methane (CBM) is a clean energy source and is considered
as one of the primary natural gas resources in China.1,2 Compared with shallow CBM reservoirs, deep-CBM formations have some
unique reservoir properties because of the greater burial depth. For
example, deep-CBM formations commonly have high gas content with high
initial reservoir pressure, ultralow permeability, and high-stress
conditions. These combined reservoir characteristics pose challenges
for CBM exploration and development.2−4 Enhanced CBM production
through sequestration of CO2 in deep coal seams is one
attractive alternative to increase gas recovery and simultaneously
reduce greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere.3,5−13 CO2-enhanced CBM technology appears to be a “win–win”
innovative technology for environmentally friendly energy production.
However, there are key technical challenges to be solved before it
can be commercially implemented, including injection optimization,
methane–CO2 counter-diffusion quantification, multicomponent
gas adsorption and competitive adsorption, and phase modification
of CO2 under in situ reservoir pressure and temperature
conditions, among others.14−21 Thus, supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) adsorption
behavior under the in situ conditions of deep coal seams needs to
be investigated in detail for reservoir assessment and evaluation
of enhanced gas production potential.

Adsorption isotherms of
CO2 in coal are the effective
method for estimating the capability and potential of enhanced coalbed
methane recovery with CO2 injection (CO2-ECBM).9,22−25 Many adsorption models have previously been employed to evaluate
the excess adsorption capacity of coals. These models include the
Freundlich model, Langmuir (L) model, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) model, Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) model, Dubinin–Astakhov
(D–A) model, and Ono–Kondo (OK) model.26−30 In addition, the ideal adsorbed solution model and the two-dimensional
equation of state have been applied to determine mixed-gas adsorption.31−34 To compare the validity of different adsorption models, some previous
studies were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the various models.33,35 For a wide pressure range of CO2 adsorption, the L model
was found to be ineffective in modeling high-pressure CO2 adsorption because of the unique phase change behavior of CO2 at high pressures, which does not occur for either CH4 or N2.36 Commonly,
all adsorption models used to depict gas adsorption behavior in most
previous studies have been applied for bituminous coal reservoirs
in relatively shallow coal seams.34,37,38 Thus, the validity of these models has been limited
for the simulation of gas adsorption behaviors from deep-CBM reservoirs,
under the conditions of high and ultrahigh pressure and temperature.

Because deep-CBM formations are normally associated with high temperature
and pressure, CO2 usually exists in a supercritical condition
during injection. It is essential to investigate the validity of the
different adsorption models used for modeling ScCO2 adsorption
in deep coal seams. The Southern Qinshui Basin (SQB) in China is a
mature CBM development with a deep-CBM reservoir,39−41 with semianthracite
and anthracite. In this study, 10 different models were tested and
compared based on semianthracite and anthracite from the SQB. These
models are the L model, two-parameter Langmuir (TL) model, Toth (T)
model, Langmuir–Freundlich (LF) model, extended Langmuir (EL)
model, double parameter BET (DBET) model, three-parameter BET (TBET)
model, D–R model, D–A model, and OK model. These models
were used in simulation studies to investigate the accuracy and reliability
of adsorption modeling in reservoir simulation results and to optimize
the appropriate model for ScCO2 adsorption through comparative
analysis. The obtained results lay the foundation for deep-CBM reservoir
development and CO2-enhanced CBM production optimization.

2.1 L Model
and Its Derivative Models
The L model assumes that the surfaces
of the adsorbent are homogeneous
and that adsorption occurs on a flat surface. The adsorption is local,
specific, and occurs at a limited number of sites under a monolayer
of adsorbate, and each localized site can accommodate only one adsorbate.42 Based on the above assumptions, the L model
can be derived as 1  where V is the adsorption
volume (cm3/g), VL is the Langmuir
volume (cm3/g), p is the pressure of adsorption
equilibrium (MPa), and PL is the Langmuir
pressure (MPa).

The TL model was established by introducing
the density of the free phase and density of the adsorbed phase in
conjunction with the L model; the TL model can be defined as 2  where nexcess is
the excess adsorption capacity (mmol/g), ninf is the absolute adsorption capacity when the pore surface is fully
covered by CO2 (mmol/g), p is the pressure
of adsorption equilibrium (MPa), ρCO2 is
the density of the free phase (g/m3), KL is the Langmuir coefficient simulated by the adsorption
model, and ρsorbed is the density of the adsorption
phase.43

The T, LF, and EL models
were established by adopting three parameters:
the binding constant Kb, model parameter n, and the Langmuir pressure PL, based on the L model.

Tóth formulated a three-parameter
equation. Although the
use of the Langmuir’s isotherm implies a homogeneous surface,
the choice of the isotherm suggests a heterogeneous surface if n ≠ 1 (0 < n ≤ 1).44 The T model (eq 3), LF model (eq 4), and EL model (eq 5) can be derived, respectively, as 3   4   5  where p is the pressure of
adsorption equilibrium, MPa; PL is the
Langmuir pressure (MPa); V is the adsorption volume
when the pressure reaches equilibrium (cm3/g); VL is the Langmuir volume (cm3/g); Kb is the binding constant (m3·[t·(MPa)n]−1); and n is a model parameter associated with the temperature and the distribution
of coal pores.

2.2 BET Model
Brunauer
et al. established
poly-molecular layer theory based on the Langmuir adsorption theory
by modifying the monolayer assumption into multilayer sorption potential.45 Following Brunauer et al.’s work, the
DBET model (eq 6) and
TBET model (eq 7) were
derived, respectively, as 6   7  

In eq 7, p0 can be obtained as
follows 8  where pc = 7.38
MPa is the critical pressure of CO2; p0 is the saturated vapor pressure (MPa); Tc = 304.25 K is the critical temperature of CO2; Vm is the adsorption capacity parameter
of the monolayer (cm3/g); C is a constant
associated with the adsorption heat and the liquefied adsorbate; p is the pressure of adsorption equilibrium (MPa); and n is a model parameter associated with the temperature and
the distribution of coal pores.

2.3 D–R
Model and D–A Model
The D–R and D–A
models were developed based on the
adsorption potential theory.46,47 The D–R model
can be derived as 9  and the D–A model can be derived as 10  where V0 is the
micropore volume (cm3/g), D is a constant
associated with the net adsorption heat, P0 is the saturated vapor pressure (MPa), and n is
a model parameter associated with the temperature and distribution
of coal pores.

2.4 OK Model
The OK
model is based on
lattice theory and was originally proposed by Ono and Kondo and extended
by Sudibandriyo et al.48,49 11  where Γ is the total
adsorption capacity of each layer (mmol/g), Γ0 is
the theoretical monolayer saturation adsorption density (mmol/g),
ρ∞ is the density of CO2 ontology
phase (mmol/L), ρmc is the density of the adsorbed
phase, taken as 23.3636 mmol/L, εs is the contact
potential energy between adsorbate molecules and the micropore surface
(J), k is a constant of 1.38065 × 10–23 J/k, and T is the experiment temperature (K).

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Origin
and Characteristics of Coal
The coal in the SQB is mostly
semianthracite and anthracite. In this
study, fresh coal samples from coal seam no. 3, named the Yuwu, Sihe,
and Chengzhuang samples, were collected from the Yuwu, Sihe, and Chengzhuang
coal mines in the SQB, respectively; the characteristics of these
coal samples are shown in Table 2. The samples were collected by columnar sampling according
to Chinese National Standard GB/T475-200850 and were prepared into pulverized coal samples by crushing and screening
fresh air-dried grains to the particle size range of 0.18–0.25
mm, according to Chinese National Standard GB/T16773-2008.51 Coal petrography, proximate analyses, and specific
surface analyses were conducted according to Chinese National Standards
GB/T8899-2013, GB/T212-2008, and GB/T21650-2008.52−54 An AXIO Imager
M1m microspectrophotometer made by Zeiss, Germany, was used for coal
petrography measurements (maceral composition and Ro,max), and a TriStar II3020 made by Micromeritics Instrument
Corporation, USA, was used for measurement of specific surface area.

Mercury
intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was conducted to analyze the
pore size distribution for all coal samples, using the Autopore IV
9500 made by Micromeritics Instrument, USA, at pressure up to 60 000
psia (413.7 MPa) following ISO 15901-1-2016.55 The pore surface areas of all coal samples were analyzed by applying
the BET theory, which is a multilayer adsorption theory (Gregg and
Sing, 1982).56 Micropore observations and
mineral quantitative analyses of anthracite samples were performed
on a ZEISS Sigma field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM
operating at 20 kV, equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer
for analysis of minerals composition) and abided by Chinese Petroleum
and Natural Gas Industry Standards SY/T 5162-2014 and SY/T 6189-1996,
respectively.57,58

3.2 Experimental
Apparatus
The CO2 adsorption isotherm was measured
using the volumetric method
and we followed the recommended procedure of Chinese National Standard
GB/T 19560-2008.59 An independent high-pressure
isotherm adsorption instrument DXF-II was developed in-house; the
system is shown in Figure 1. The system includes a vacuum-pumping system, isothermal
adsorption system, gas supercharging system, computer-control system,
and a gas cylinder of CO2. A schematic diagram of the experimental
apparatus was previously reported in the corresponding research.60

3.3 Experimental
Procedure and Measurement Conditions
In this study, pure
CO2 adsorption experiments were
conducted at 45, 62.5, and 80 °C, respectively (Table 3). The temperatures and pressures
were selected according to the corresponding coal burial depths of
1000, 1500, and 2000 m. The adsorption isothermal experiment of ScCO2 was carried out after equilibrium moisture treatment of all
coal samples.

Helium as a reference gas
is widely used to determine the free
volume of sample cells in adsorption experiments, regardless of the
low-pressure and high-pressure conditions, because helium is non-adsorbing
and inert, according to published references internationally.22,61,62 A complete experiment for ScCO2 adsorption consists of five consecutive steps: (1) checking
system airtightness; system airtightness, including the reference
cell, sample cell, and tubing, was checked with helium at 10 MPa.
If the system pressure remained constant for 6 h, the system was regarded
to have good airtightness.51 Then, the
system was degassed under a high vacuum of 10–3 Pa
for at least 24 h prior to beginning the measurements. (2) Setting
experimental conditions; CO2 and helium were injected into
reference cells at high pressure (above 10 MPa). The temperature of
the sample cell and gas reference cells was set to 45 °C. The
confining pressure and the opening pressure of the liquid-displacement
valve were set to 10 MPa using a Gilson pump. The equilibrium time
for adsorption was beyond 12 h. After temperature and pressure equilibrium
were achieved, tubing and sample cells were degassed once again. (3)
Calibrating errors; measurements of free-space volume calibration
and pore pressure-induced water displacement were conducted using
helium at pressures between 2.0 and 9.5 MPa. (4) Adsorption measurements
were run by increasing the CO2 injection pressure in a
step-wise manner to a maximum of 10 MPa. CO2 was injected
into the sample cell by a booster pump until the sample reached adsorption
equilibrium. The variations of pressure and temperature of the sample
cell and gas reference cells were continuously monitored by an online
data acquisition system.

After measurement of ScCO2 adsorption at the temperature
of 45 °C, the same sample cell and pipelines were degassed once
again. The experimental temperature was reset to 62.5 °C, CO2 and helium were injected into the cells at high pressure
(above 16 MPa), and the confining pressure and opening pressure of
the liquid-displacement valve were set to 16 MPa using a Gilson pump.
After the temperature and pressure of the apparatus reached equilibrium,
the measurement procedures (3) and (4) were repeated. At 62.5 °C,
the adsorption measurements were run to the final pressure of 16 MPa.
After this, the temperature was increased to 80 °C, and the adsorption
measurements were run by increasing the CO2 injection pressure
to 20 MPa.

3.4 Calculation of Adsorption
Capacity
Adsorption capacity can be determined according
to the manometric/volumetric
method and the gravimetric method.22,26,32,38,61,62 The gravimetric method requires
a very accurate balance to determine the amount of gas sorbed at a
constant pressure, the volumetric method requires very accurate determination
of cell and free-space volumes, and the manometric method can determine
the amount of the gas sorbed by means of pressure readings.

The excess (Gibbs) adsorption capacity obtained in the experiment
is distinguished from the actual adsorption capacity, especially in
a state of high pressure; therefore, the excess adsorption capacity
and the absolute adsorption capacity were calculated, respectively.
The density of the adsorbed phase for CO2 was calculated
according to the van der Waals equation of ideal gas.43

Based on the equilibrium pressure and experimental
temperature
from the reference cells and sample cells, the excess adsorption capacity
under different equilibrium pressures was calculated according to
the manometric method.

3.5 Simulation Method
During the simulation,
the pressure of adsorption equilibrium was selected as the independent
variable, the adsorption capacity was selected as the dependent variable,
and the simulation parameters were calculated by the Newton iterative
method. Based on the obtained simulation formulas, the simulation
model values could be calculated from the different adsorption models.
The regression coefficients (R2) and correlation
coefficients (R) of the simulation formulas were
calculated based on the experimental values and simulation values
of the adsorption capacity.

4.2 Pore Size Distribution

Pores
The pore size distribution curves determined using
MIP show that the incremental pore volumes with pore diameters lower
than 100 nm comprise a considerable proportion (Figure 2). Tables 5 and 6 show the pore volumes
and their percentages for different types of the pores and the surface
areas and their percentages for different types of the pores.

surface area; S1/St to S4/St, percentage of surface area from macropore, mesopore, transitional

According to Tables 5 and 6, the proportions
of transitional pores
and micropores in terms of the total pore volume and surface area
are dominant, which indicates that transitional pores and micropores
play the dominant role in gas adsorption. In addition, the pore volumes
and surface areas from all coal samples indicate that the Chengzhuang
sample has the highest values of pore volume and pore surface area,
the Yuwu sample has the lowest value of surface area from transitional
pores and micropores, and the Sihe sample has the lowest pore volume
from transitional pores and micropores, which suggest that the growth
of transitional pores and micropores in the Sihe sample is better
than that in the Yuwu sample and will be beneficial to ScCO2 adsorption.

The genetic types of pores in coal from the SQB,
China have been
discussed in the relevant work63,64 and include gas pores,
shrinkage-induced pores, and mineral-related pores. Figure 3 shows the pore types and mineral
compositions in all coal samples. The pore types in all coal samples
include gas pores (Figure 3a,d,e), shrinkage-induced pores (Figure 3b), and mineral-related pores such as intercrystalline
pores and dissolution pores (Figure 3b,d,f); the types of minerals include kaolinite, pyrite,
and barite (Figure 3b–d,f).

4.3 Experimental Results of
CO2 Adsorption
The excess adsorption isotherms
of pure CO2 from the
Yuwu, Sihe, and Chengzhuang coal mines at temperatures of 45, 62.5,
and 80 °C are plotted in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4, the excess adsorption capacity generally increases
with increase in pressure. However, the excess adsorption capacity
starts to decrease after a certain pressure is reached for different
temperature conditions, that is, the excess adsorption capacity exhibits
a maximum around the critical pressure.65,66 The higher
the operating temperature, the higher the pressure where the excess
adsorption starts to decrease, as shown in Figure 4. This decrease of excess adsorption is expected
as the adsorbed phase volume is not yet corrected.67 Meanwhile, variation of the excess adsorption capacity
under low pressure calculated based on the free volume determined
with helium is different from the excess adsorption capacity under
high pressure calculated based on the free volume determined with
helium, and there is a negative adsorption phenomenon, that is, the
excess adsorption capacity shows a decrease when the pressure reaches
a peak, caused by the density of the adsorbed phase, based on the
synthetic measurement of the free volume.67,68 The cause of the negative adsorption is controversial, but it does
not affect the work described in this paper.

Figure 4 Excess adsorption isotherms
of ScCO2 adsorption at temperatures
of 45 °C (318 K), 62.5 °C (333.5 K), and 80 °C (349
K) from Yuwu coal mine (a), Sihe coal mine (b), and Chengzhuang coal
mine (c).

Figure 5 presents
the absolute adsorption capacities of pure CO2 for the
Yuwu, Sihe, and Chengzhuang coal mines at the temperatures of 45,
62.5, and 80 °C. As shown in Figure 5, the absolute capacity increases with the
increase of pressure. Based on comparison with the excess adsorption
capacities (Figure 4) and the absolute adsorption capacities (Figure 5) of ScCO2, the absolute capacity
of ScCO2 is always higher than the excess adsorption capacity
of ScCO2 at all equilibrium pressures. The comparison results
indicate that there are significant differences between the excess
adsorption capacity of ScCO2 and the absolute adsorption
capacity of ScCO2 for the tested deep coal samples. Moreover,
the variation of the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 or the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2 has similar
features at different temperatures. The different adsorption capacities
of ScCO2 from deep coal seams demonstrate that accurate
adsorption modeling requires proper model screening.

temperatures of 45 °C (318 K), 62.5 °C (333.5 K), and 80

coal mine (c).

4.4 Modeling
of Coal Sorption with Different Models
and Their Comparison
Taking the Sihe sample as an example,
comparison of the experimental and modeled results at the temperatures
of 45 °C (318 K), 62.5 °C (333.5 K), and 80 °C (349
K) is shown in Figures 6–8. Because the
unit of adsorption capacity in the TL and OK models is mmol, which
is different from the other adsorption models, the figures showing
adsorption capacity are plotted separately (Figures 6–13). The R2 and R of the
simulation results from the different adsorption models are listed
in Table 7.

As shown in Figures 6–8 along with data in Table 7, most of the adsorption models
can describe the variational characteristics of the excess adsorption
capacity of ScCO2, and the simulation degree for the excess
adsorption capacity of ScCO2 at a relatively low temperature
is higher than that at a relatively high temperature. At each temperature,
the modeled results at low pressure are superior to the modeled results
at high pressure. As shown in Figures 6–8, the modeled values
of excess adsorption capacity deviate from the experimental values
at a certain value of equilibrium pressure, and the trend becomes
more obvious with the increase of the experimental pressure; the simulation
accuracy in Table 7 also demonstrates this point, that is, that the regression coefficients R2 and the correlation coefficients R of the simulation formula decrease with increase of the experiment
temperature. There is an inflection point of the excess adsorption
capacity when the equilibrium pressure is 8.13 MPa, the first value
beyond the critical pressure 7.38 MPa. When the equilibrium pressure
exceeds 7.38 MPa, the modeled results start to deviate from the experimental
data and the deficiency increases with increased pressure. Based on 1, in the L, T, LF, EL, and DBET models, the excess
adsorption capacity is a monotonous increasing function of equilibrium
pressure. The excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 should
always increase as the pressure increases, and no inflection points
exist for the L, T, LF, EL, and DBET models. The excess adsorption
capacities of ScCO2 can show inflection points for the
TL, D–R, D–A, TBET, and OK models, and this means that
these models are capable of modeling excess adsorption capacity of
ScCO2. According to Figures 6–8, not all adsorption
models can model the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 across all pressures and temperatures, especially high temperatures
and pressures.

To analyze the validity of the adsorption models
at low and high
pressures, the Sihe sample at a temperature of 80 °C was chosen
as an example. Figures 9 and 10 demonstrate the comparison of the
experimental and modeled results with equilibrium pressure less than
or equal to 8.13 MPa and greater than 8.13 MPa, respectively. The R2 and R values of the regression
values are listed in Table 8.

As shown in Figures 9 and 10 and Table 8, when the equilibrium pressure is less than
or equal to 8.13 MPa, the modeled results agree well with the experimental
data for the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2. When
the equilibrium pressure is greater than 8.13 MPa, the results from
most of the adsorption models agree reasonably with the experimental
data. In contrast, the T, D–A, TL, and OK models have more
deviations than the other adsorption models.

Based on analysis
of Figures 4 and 5, the absolute adsorption
capacity of ScCO2 is higher than the excess adsorption
capacity of ScCO2. To simulate the absolute adsorption
capacity of ScCO2, Figure 11 presents a comparison of the experimental and modeled
results of the adsorption capacity of ScCO2 with different
models at the temperature of 80 °C for the Sihe sample. The R2 and R of different models
are listed in Table 9.

As shown in Figure 11 and Table 9, most
of the adsorption models have relatively high precision for the absolute
adsorption capacity of ScCO2. However, there is relatively
larger deviation for the D–R and D–A models. Because
of the model assumptions and functional properties, the absolute adsorption
capacities of ScCO2 show a turning point when the TL, D–R,
D–A, TBET, and OK models are adopted, which is inconsistent
with the characteristics of increasing absolute adsorption capacity
of ScCO2 with the increase of equilibrium pressure.

To analyze the difference between the absolute adsorption capacity
of CO2 at low equilibrium pressure and that at high equilibrium
pressure, a sectionalized simulation for the absolute adsorption capacity
of ScCO2 is shown in Figures 12 and 13. Table 10 presents the R2 and R of the regression results
for various models and pressures.

As shown in Figures 12 and 13 and Table 10, most of the adsorption models
have great
precision for modeling absolute ScCO2 capacity, but the
D–A model is not suitable for modeling absolute adsorption.

Based on the above analysis, most of the adsorption models can
be reasonably used to model the excess and absolute adsorption capacities
of ScCO2. It was found that these models are applicable
for low pressure (≤8.13 MPa). A good match of the modeled and
experimental results does not mean that the modeled results are valid;
the model parameters obtained by a simulation must be analyzed further,
and the suitability of the adsorption model must be thoroughly evaluated
and assessed.

4.5 Comparison and Model Screening
for ScCO2 Sorption
An appropriate adsorption model
should
meet the following criteria: (1) the regressed parameter must have
physical significance; (2) the modeled results must be in accordance
with the adsorption characteristics of ScCO2 for deep coal
seams; (3) the modeling precision should be high enough for accurate
prediction.

Based on the above criteria, in comparing the 10
adsorption models in the previous analyses, the regressed modeling
parameters VL, PL, ninf, KL, Kb, n, P0, Vm, C, Vb, D, and Γ0 must all have positive values. Moreover, n in the exponential function, which appears in the T, LF, EL, TBET,
and D–A models, must be a positive nonzero integer.

The
results for the simulation parameters with different adsorption
models for the excess adsorption capacities of ScCO2 from
the Sihe sample at the different temperatures are summarized in Table 11.

As shown in Table 11, the parameter n simulated by the
EL model and
the parameters Vm and P0 simulated by the DBET model are less than 0 and thus
have no physical significance; therefore, the EL and DBET models are
not suitable to simulate the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2. In addition, the parameter VL in the EL model for the different coal samples is obviously abnormal.
When the TBET model is used to simulate the excess adsorption capacity
of ScCO2, the parameters C and P0 are less than 0 for the Sihe sample at temperatures
of 45 and 80 °C and thus have no physical significance. These
results show that the stability of the TBET model is poor when it
is used to simulate the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 for a deep coal seam. Based on the above analyses, the L, TL, T,
LF, D–A, D–R, and OK models are effective and can be
used to model the adsorption isotherms of the excess adsorption of
ScCO2 in the scope of the whole equilibrium pressure range
for deep coal seams.

Table 12 summarizes
the results for the regression parameters with different adsorption
models for the excess adsorption capacities of ScCO2 from
the Sihe samples at a temperature of 80 °C and different ranges

Based
on Table 12, when
the sectionalized simulation for the excess adsorption capacity
of ScCO2 is adopted, most of the parameters lose physical
significance, such as PL in the L model, Kb in the LF model, VL and n in the EL model, Vm, C, and P0 in the DBET
model, C in the TBET model, and D in the D–A model. In addition, VL in the EL model is obviously abnormal. When the equilibrium pressure
is lower than 8.13 MPa, most of the adsorption models have reasonable
accuracy in modeling the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2, except the EL and DBET models. However, when the equilibrium pressure
is higher than 8.13 MPa, most of the adsorption models are not applicable
to describe the excess adsorption capacities of ScCO2,
except the TL, T, D–R, and OK models. Above all, the TL, T,
D–R, and OK models are effective and can be used to simulate
the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 when sectionalized
modeling for this capacity is adopted.

Table 13 demonstrates
the results for the simulation parameters with different adsorption
models for the absolute adsorption capacities of ScCO2 from
the Sihe sample at a temperature of 80 °C under different ranges
of equilibrium pressure.

As shown in Table 13, when the equilibrium pressure varies from
0 to 20 MPa, the parameters ninf and KL in the
TL model, n in the T model, Kb and n in the LF model, VL and n in the EL model, C and P0 in the DBET model, and Vm and P0 in the
TBET model are all less than 0 and thus lose physical significance.
In addition, the parameter VL in the EL
model is obviously abnormal. According to the above analysis, the
L model, D–A model, D–R model, and OK model are effective
and can be used to model the adsorption isotherms of the absolute
adsorption of ScCO2 for the whole pressure range.

Based on Table 13, when the equilibrium pressure is less than or equal to 8.13 MPa,
parameters such as n in the EL model and C and P0 in the DBET model are
all less than 0 and lose their physical significance. In addition,
the parameters VL in the T model and VL in the EL model are obviously abnormal when
the equilibrium pressure is less than or equal to 8.13 MPa. Therefore,
the L model, TL model, LF model, TBET model, D–A model, D–R
model, and OK model are effective in modeling the absolute adsorption
capacity of ScCO2 when the equilibrium pressure is lower
than 8.13 MPa. However, when the equilibrium pressure is higher than
8.13 MPa, a portion or all of the parameters in all adsorption models
lose physical significance. In this work, the linear simulation, exponential
simulation, logarithmic simulation, power function simulation, and
polynomial simulation were conducted when the equilibrium was higher
than 8.13 MPa. Figure 14 shows the modeled results from the linear simulation, exponential
simulation, logarithmic simulation, power function simulation, and
polynomial simulation for the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2.

Figure 14 Simulation results of absolute adsorption isotherms of ScCO2 adsorption using the linear function (a,b), the exponential
function (c,d), the logarithmic function (e,f), the power function
simulation (g,h), the polynomial function (i,j) with the equilibrium
pressure beyond 8.13 MPa and at a temperature of 80 °C (349 K)
from Sihe coal mine; units of absolute adsorption capacity adopted
by cm3/g and mmol, respectively.

Figure 14 shows
that the linear simulation, exponential simulation, logarithmic simulation,
power function simulation, and polynomial simulation all have good
precision; the R2 values are 0.973, 0.9872,
0.9282, 0.9576, and 0.9959 respectively. The simulation results suggest
that these five types of functions all can meet the needs for simulation
of the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2 when the equilibrium
pressure is higher than 8.13 MPa. However, the results for R2 show that the polynomial simulation, exponential
simulation, and linear simulation are superior to the logarithmic
simulation and power function simulation.

All selected models
in this paper are nonlinear, so R2 and R cannot be used as effective standards
for evaluating the superiority of the models. In this paper, the standard
error S (eq 12) and the residual sum
of squares SSE (eq 13) are defined to evaluate the simulation effectiveness of the model
simulations. Smaller S and SSE indicate higher model
accuracy 12   13  where S is the standard error,
SSE is the residual sum of squares, n is the number
of data points, and Vi and Ve are the experimental value and
simulated value of the adsorption capacity of each pressure spot,
respectively.

According to eqs 12 and 13, the units of the excess
adsorption
capacity in the TL model and OK model were converted to the same units
of the excess adsorption capacity in the other adsorption models.
The values of S and SSE for the seven selected adsorption
models were calculated for the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2; the results are shown in Table 14.

As shown in Table 14, when the experimental
temperature was 45 °C, for the Sihe
sample, the order of superiority of the seven types of adsorption
model for the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 is as
follows: T model = LF model > D–R model > D–A
model
> L model > TL model > OK model. When the experimental temperature
for the Sihe sample was 62.5 °C, the order of superiority of
the seven types of adsorption models for excess adsorption capacity
of ScCO2 is as follows: D–R model > D–A
model
> T model > LF model > L model > OK model > TL model.
When the experimental
temperature for the Sihe sample was 80 °C, the order of superiority
for the seven types of adsorption model for the excess adsorption
capacity of ScCO2 is as follows: D–R model >
D–A
model > T model > LF model > TL model > L model > OK
model.

To verify the above results, the Yuwu sample was taken
as a further
example; the results of S and SSE for the different
adsorption models for the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 at different temperatures are shown in Table 15.

As indicated in Table 15, for this sample,
the order of the superiority of the seven
types of the adsorption model for the excess adsorption capacity of
ScCO2 is as follows: D–R model > D–A model
> T model > LF model > L model > TL model > OK model,
when the experimental
temperature from the Yuwu sample was different.

Based on a combination
of Tables 14 and 15, the D–R and
D–A models had the best precision during the simulation of
the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 for the whole equilibrium
pressure range. The T and LF models had moderate precision among the
seven adsorption models, and the L, TL, and OK models had relatively
low precision. Of these seven adsorption models, the D–R, D–A,
TL, and OK models all can represent the inflection point of the excess
adsorption capacity of ScCO2. Therefore, the D–R
and D–A models are the optimal adsorption models for simulation
of the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 for the whole
equilibrium pressure range.

Table 16 shows
the results of S and SSE for the four selected adsorption
models for the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 at a
temperature of 80 °C and at different ranges of equilibrium pressure.

As shown in Table 16, when the equilibrium pressure was less than or equal
to 8.13 MPa,
the order of priority of the four types of adsorption model in the
simulation of the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 is
as follows: T model > TL model > D–R model > OK model.
The
order of priority for the four types of adsorption model in the simulation
of the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 when the equilibrium
pressure was beyond 8.13 MPa is as follows: D–R model >
T model
> TL model > OK model. Moreover, the results for the priority
of the
four adsorption models are in accordance with the adsorption characteristics
of ScCO2 under different ranges of equilibrium pressure.
Given the above, the T, TL, and D–R models are the optimal
adsorption models for the sectionalized simulation of the excess adsorption
capacity of ScCO2 under different scopes of equilibrium
pressure.

Table 17 shows
the results of S and SSE for the four selected adsorption
models in the simulation of the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2 at the temperature of 80 °C and across the whole equilibrium
pressure range. Table 18 shows the results of S and SSE for the seven selected
adsorption models for the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2 at the temperature of 80 °C and equilibrium pressure
of less than or equal to 8.13 MPa.

As shown in Table 17, when the equilibrium pressure is the whole pressure
with a range
of 0–20 MPa, for the Sihe sample at a temperature of 80 °C,
the order of superiority of the four types of adsorption model for
the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2 is as follows:
L model > OK model > D–R model > D–A model.
Moreover,
the results for the order of priority of the four adsorption model
are in accordance with the adsorption characteristics of ScCO2 under different ranges of equilibrium pressure. When the
equilibrium pressure is less than or equal to 8.13 MPa, the order
of superiority of the seven types of adsorption model for the absolute
adsorption capacity of ScCO2 is as follows: TBET model
> LF model > L model > D–A model > TL model >
D–R model
> OK model, again for the Sihe sample at the temperature of 80
°C.

According to the results in Table 18, the values of S and SSE
from the
TBET and LF models are far lower than those from the other adsorption
models. Therefore, the TBET and LF models are the optimal adsorption
models for simulation of the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2 when the equilibrium pressure is less than or equal to 8.13
MPa. When the equilibrium pressure is higher than 80 °C, the
linear simulation, exponential simulation, logarithmic simulation,
power function simulation, and polynomial simulation can be used to
simulate the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2.

5 Conclusions
This article investigates the sorption
characteristics of ScCO2 for deep coal seams of the SQB,
China. Ten different adsorption
models were considered to model the excess and absolute adsorption
capacities of ScCO2 under various temperatures and pressures.
The optimal adsorption models were selected by parametric comparison
and analyses based on the standard error and the residual sum of squares.
The conclusions can be summarized as follows:(1) The excess adsorption
capacity of
ScCO2 has a common turning decline point at different pressures
under different temperatures. The absolute capacity of ScCO2 always increases with the increase of injection pressure. It is
higher than the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 at
each equilibrium pressure.

(2) Most of the adsorption models can
describe adsorption characteristics and have good agreement with the
experimental results when the pressure is less than 8.13 MPa for excess
and absolute adsorption capacities. When the pressure is greater than
8.13 MPa, deviations of the modeled results are observed for most
of the models.

(3) The
analytical results of the adsorption
model parameters reveal that there is an obvious difference in the
validity of the different adsorption models for the excess adsorption
capacity and the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2.
The L, TL, T, LF, D–A, D–R, and OK models are effective
in the simulation of adsorption isotherms for the excess adsorption
of ScCO2 in the scope of the whole equilibrium pressure
range. The TL, T, D–R, and OK models are effective when sectionalized
simulation is adopted. In representation of the absolute adsorption
isotherms of ScCO2, the L, D–A, D–R, and
OK models are effective in the scope of the whole equilibrium pressure.
The L, TL, LF, TBET, D–A, D–R, and OK models are effective
when the equilibrium pressure is lower than or equal to 8.13 MPa.
All adsorption models lose physical significance when the equilibrium
pressure is higher than 8.13 MPa.

(4) The calculation results from the standard
error S and the residual sum of squares SSE show
that the D–R model and D–A model are the optimal adsorption
models in the simulation of the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 with the condition of the whole equilibrium pressure range.
The T, TL, and D–R models are the optimal adsorption models
in the simulation of the excess adsorption capacity of ScCO2 in the selected adsorption model when the equilibrium pressure is
divided into two sections at the point of 8.13 MPa. In the simulation
of the absolute adsorption capacity of ScCO2, the TBET
model and LF model are the optimal adsorption models for selection
when the equilibrium pressure is less than or equal to 8.13 MPa. The
linear simulation, exponential simulation, logarithmic simulation,
power function simulation, and polynomial simulation all have good
precision and can be used when the equilibrium pressure is beyond
8.13 MPa.
