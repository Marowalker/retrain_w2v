Supramolecular peptide nanofibers
are attractive for applications
in vaccine development due to their ability to induce strong immune
responses without added adjuvants or associated inflammation. Here,
we report that self-assembling peptide nanofibers bearing CD4+ or
CD8+ T cell epitopes are processed through mechanisms of autophagy
in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Using standard in vitro antigen
presentation assays, we confirmed loss and gain of the adjuvant function
using pharmacological modulators of autophagy and APCs deficient in
multiple autophagy proteins. The incorporation of microtubule-associated
protein 1A/1B-light chain-3 (LC3-II) into the autophagosomal membrane,
a key biological marker for autophagy, was confirmed using microscopy.
Our findings indicate that autophagy in APCs plays an essential role
in the mechanism of adjuvant action of supramolecular peptide nanofibers.

Introduction
Biomaterials constructed
from de novo designed peptides that assemble
into supramolecular nanofibers and hydrogels have enormous potential
for applications in biology and medicine.1,2 Self-assembling
peptide biomaterials have been used as multivalent scaffolds for applications
in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery due
to their biocompatibility, ease of synthesis, and the rich chemistry
with which the primary sequence can be manipulated to impart structure
or function.3−5 In recent years, β-sheet rich peptide nanofibers
have attracted considerable attention as immune adjuvants for applications
in vaccine development and immunotherapy due to their ability to induce
strong antibody and cellular responses to conjugated antigens.6,7 Unlike traditional depot-forming adjuvants (alum or Freund’s),
peptide nanofibers are noninflammatory and vaccination does not lead
to inflammation at the injection site (recruitment of neutrophils,
eosinophils, monocytes, etc.).8 Several
studies have confirmed the efficacy of peptide nanofiber-based vaccines
in animal models of infectious disease, cancer, and drug addiction;
however, the immunological mechanisms that drive the adjuvant potential
have not yet been elucidated.9−14 In this study, we investigated intracellular mechanisms in macrophages
(MΦs) and dendritic cells (DCs) that are involved in processing
of peptide nanofibers and presentation of antigens to CD4+ and CD8+
T cells.

Previous studies have shown that changes in physicochemical
properties
of peptide nanofibers could lead to loss or gain of adjuvant function.
Targeted amino acid substitutions (F → P) in the core of the
self-assembling peptide Q11 (QQKFQFQFEQQ) led to loss of self-assembly
and Ab responses, confirming that supramolecular assembly is required
for adjuvant activity.12 Recently, Wen
et al. designed Q11-based peptides with a broad range of physicochemical
properties and found that despite presenting a competent epitope,
negatively charged nanofibers were not taken up by antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages and lacked
adjuvant activity.15 In comparison, positively
charged nanofibers significantly enhanced uptake by APCs and immune
responses.15 Our lab reported that changing
the chirality of the self-assembling domain KFE8 (FKFEFKFE) from the
natural l-form to protease-resistant d-form did
not impact self-assembly but significantly enhanced in vivo persistence
and the Ab response, suggesting a role for intracellular proteases
in the processing of nanofibers.16 Taken
together, these studies suggest that innate cellular mechanisms in
APCs involved in the clearance and degradation of cytoplasmic contents,
and immune recognition and antigen presentation, possibly play a role
in the mechanism of action of peptide nanofibers.

An evolutionarily
conserved mechanism that cells use to degrade
cytoplasmic proteins and organelles and maintain cellular homeostasis
is “autophagy”.17 Autophagy
is crucial for the clearance of fibrillar protein aggregates implicated
in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s18,19 and a component of innate immunity that is involved in host defense
elimination of pathogens.20 Autophagy has
been identified as a route by which cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens
are delivered to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules
for presentation to CD4+ T cells and MHC class I cross-presentation
of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells.21 Macroautophagy,
a general form of autophagy, targets the clearance of damaged organelles,
cytosolic proteins, and invasive microbes by sequestering them within
cytosolic double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes.17 Autophagosomes then deliver the cytoplasmic
components to lysosomes, which degrade the contents through proteolysis
and antigens loaded onto MHC class II molecules for presentation.21 This presumably explains why the antibody response
to peptide nanofibers is completely abolished in the absence of CD4+
T cells (which help B cells that have encountered the same antigen
to make antibodies).12 In this study, we
investigated and confirmed a role for autophagy in the mechanism of
adjuvant action of peptide nanofibers.

Results and Discussion

significantly higher in MΦs treated with KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers
compared to that in MΦs treated with soluble Ag85B at two different
doses tested (E). *p < 0.05 using Student’s t-test (n = 4 per group).

To assess MHC class II antigen presentation, we
used a peptide
fragment from Ag85B protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
a well-known immunodominant protein, which induces cell proliferation
and production of IL-2 and interferon-γ in lymphocytes from
Mtb-infected C57BL6 mice. Kariyone et al. used a series of 15-amino-acid
peptides that overlapped each other by five amino acids and identified
an immunodominant MHC class II antigenic epitope FQDAY-NAAGGHNAVF
(aa 240−254) that requires processing by antigen-presenting
cells (referred to as Ag85B peptide here).23 Further transgenic CD4+ T cells that recognize Ag85B peptide are
available (BB7 hybridoma) for use in in vitro antigen-presentation
assays. Similarly, MHC class I epitope OVA (SIINFEKL) and its cognate
OT-I cells (CD8+ T cells with receptors specific for OVA) were used
to gain potential insights into differences in antigen presentation
between soluble and fibrillized antigens.

The amphipathic peptide
KFE8 (FKFEFKFE) was used as the self-assembling
domain because it is the most studied and well characterized with
abundant data pertaining to sequence length and pattern variation
of amino acids on self-assembly.22 Also,
we have previously shown that KFE8 is a powerful immune adjuvant
in mice, raising robust antibody and cellular immune responses.9,10,12,16 The fusion peptide KFE8-Ag85B was synthesized by linking the epitopes
using a proteolytic amino acid spacer (GGAAY). Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) data indicated that KFE8-Ag85B assembled into robust
fibrillar architectures with shorter morphology compared to that of
KFE8 (Figure 1B,C).
Interestingly, a structural shift was observed from cross-β
secondary structure with signals at 218 (β-sheet) and 205 nm
(from π−π effects) for KFE8 to a pure β-sheet
structure (220−230 nm) for KFE8-Ag85B (Figure 1D) and KFE8-OVA (Figure S6). This is not surprising because conjugation of an epitope
to the N- or C-terminus of a self-assembling domain could potentially
impact its assembly and spatial organization, and such transitions
have been reported before for other epitope-bearing peptides.16

In an in vitro antigen presentation assay,
BB7 or OT-I cells release
IL-2 in response to Ag85B–MHC II recognition or OVA-MHC I recognition
on MΦs, respectively, which can be quantified using ELISA (Figure 1A).24 To investigate the effect of self-assembly on antigen processing
and presentation of CD4+ T cell epitopes, bone marrow-derived MΦs
from wild-type (WT) mice were first treated with BCG, which leads
to the rapid expression of intracellular antigen processing and presentation
machinery. The cells were washed and overlaid with medium containing
soluble Ag85B or KFE8-Ag85B, and the amount of antigen (Ag85B) was
kept constant in both groups. Following overlay with BB7 cells, IL-2
production was found to be significantly higher in MΦs treated
with KFE8-Ag85B compared to that in MΦs treated with Ag85B at
two different concentrations tested (Figure 1E). A similar effect was also observed in
bone marrow-derived DCs (Figure S1). To
confirm that BCG-derived Ag85B was not a confounding factor in the
observed IL-2 response, we conducted the assay without first infecting
MΦs and observed similar results (Figure S2). However, an overall decrease in the amount of IL-2 was
observed compared to that in BCG-treated groups, presumably due to
the lack of pattern recognition receptors that activate additional
innate immune mechanisms. In MΦs treated with bare KFE8 nanofibers,
IL-2 production was negligible, suggesting that the nanofibers did
not induce any bystander activation and that IL-2 production by BB7
cells was antigen-specific (Figure S2).
These data indicate that self-assembly into supramolecular nanofibers
imparts physical properties to peptides that enhance antigen processing
and presentation by MΦs and DCs.

To assess whether pathways
of autophagy were involved in the processing
and presentation of KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers, MΦs were pretreated
with pharmacological modulators before incubation with nanofibers
and loss or gain of IL-2 was measured. Data indicated significant
loss of IL-2 in MΦs pretreated with the autophagy inhibitor
3-methyl adenine (3MA),25 which blocks
the formation of autophagosomes by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol
3-kinases (PI3K) (Figure 2A). IL-2 levels from 3MA-treated MΦs were comparable
to those of soluble Ag85B (Figure 2A), and addition of 3MA did not impact IL-2 production
by MΦs treated with soluble Ag85B (Figure S3). Also, addition of bafilomycin to MΦs, an inhibitor
of vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase)26 (prevents fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes) also resulted
in reduced IL-2 production (Figure S3).
Interestingly, bafilomycin also caused loss of IL-2 production in
MΦs treated with soluble Ag85B (Figure S3). On the contrary, higher levels of IL-2 were detected in MΦs
treated with rapamycin, a direct inhibitor of mTOR, which is a major
negative regulatory axis of autophagy (Figure 2A).27 The addition
of rapamycin has been shown to enhance the presentation of soluble
antigens and is approved by the FDA for clinical use. These findings
demonstrate a role for macroautophagy in processing of peptide nanofibers
in APCs and presentation to CD4+ T cells.

Figure 2 Autophagy is essential
for antigenic-processing and presentation
of self-assembling peptide nanofibers. IL-2 production by MΦs
treated with KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers was significantly reduced in the
presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3MA, whereas treatment with rapamycin
(inducer of autophagy) enhanced IL-2 production (A). Data demonstrating
that IL-2 production is significantly impaired in WT MΦs treated
with the autophagy inhibitor 3MA and Atg5–/– MΦs treated with KFE8-Ag85B (B). Addition of 3MA or rapamycin
to Atg5–/– MΦs treated with KFE8-Ag85B did not impact IL-2 production
(B). *p < 0.05 by analysis of variance (ANOVA)
using Tukey’s post-hoc test (n = 3 per group,
data representative of two experiments with similar results). Representative
fluorescent microscopy images (C). Macrophage lysates tested for microtubule
associated with light chain (LC3B) using western blot (day 1 post
treatment) also demonstrated increased expression of the lapidated
form of LC3 (LC3B-II) by bare as well as Ag85B conjugated nanofiber,
hence further confirming the induction of autophagy by nanofibers
(D). Quantification of autophagy in WT or Atg5–/– MΦs (E), indicating significantly more LC3B puncta in WT MΦs
treated with KFE8-Ag85B compared to that in WT MΦs treated with
soluble Ag85B. Data shown is the average of five fields from each
group.

The execution of autophagy involves
a set of evolutionarily conserved
gene products, known as the autophagy-related (Atg) proteins.17 To further confirm our findings with pharmacological
modulators of autophagy, the involvement of Atg proteins that play
a role in the formation of the isolation membrane and the autophagosomes
was investigated. One of the key autophagy proteins that controls
autophagosome formation is Atg5.28 Using
a fully reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicle system and recombinant
proteins, it has been shown that the conserved Atg5–Atg12/Atg16
complex is essential for autophagosome formation and that membrane
binding is mediated by Atg5.28 We cultured
bone marrow-derived MΦs from Atg5–/– mice and conducted in vitro antigen presentation assays using soluble
Ag85B or KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers, as described above. Data indicated
significantly lower levels of IL-2 in Atg5–/– MΦs treated with KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers and was comparable
to WT MΦs pretreated with 3MA or soluble Ag85B (Figure 2B). Addition of 3MA or rapamycin
to Atg5–/– MΦs cultured with KFE8-Ag85B
nanofibers did not result in loss or gain of function, as expected
(Figure 2B). Further
studies were conducted in Atg7-deficient DCs to exclude the possibility
that impaired antigen presentation of peptide nanofibers was not limited
to MΦs or Atg5. Data indicated significantly reduced IL-2 production
in Atg7–/– DCs treated with Ag85B nanofibers;
however, a similar loss of IL-2 was also observed in DCs treated with
soluble Ag85B (Figure S4). Although the
exact mechanism of Atg7–/– in processing
and presentation of soluble or fibrillized antigens is beyond the
scope of this study, the data clearly indicate that MΦs and
DCs deficient in autophagy-related proteins exhibit impaired antigen
processing and presentation of peptide nanofibers. To confirm whether
autophagy is triggered only by peptide nanofibers that are phagocytosed/endocytosed
from the environment or also by nanofibers that form within the cell,
we used a second self-assembling domain NapFFKYp (Nap = napthylalanine,
Yp = phosphotyrosine). Unlike KFE8, which assembles in the presence
of salt-containing buffers, assembly of NapFFKYp (referred hereafter
as NapFFK) is triggered by the cleavage of the phosphate group on
the tryptophan side chain by intracellular phosphatases.29 Therefore, NapFFK nanofibers form inside the
macrophages and allow investigation of autophagy in response to intracellular
aggregates. Interestingly, IL-2 production in Atg5–/– MΦs was also impaired when treated with Ag85B-NapFFK peptide,
which suggests that autophagy is engaged by peptide nanofibers acquired
from the extracellular environment and also intracellular peptide
aggregates (Figure S5).

The key biological
marker to identify autophagy in mammalian systems
is the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain-3 (LC3).30 During autophagy, the C-terminal glycine of
cytosolic LC3-1 is lipidated to form LC3-II, which is then recruited
and tightly bound to the autophagosomal membrane.30 To visually confirm autophagic processes in MΦs treated
with Ag85B nanofibers, WT or Atg5–/– MΦs
were first treated with soluble or fibrillar Ag85B, stained with LC3-II
antibody, and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy to detect autophagosomes.
Data indicated numerous green fluorescent punctate structures in WT
MΦs treated with KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers but none in WT or Atg5–/– MΦs treated with soluble Ag85B (Figure 2C). To further confirm
the effect of nanofibers on autophagy, we measured the levels of microtubule-associated
light chain-3 (LC3B) protein in mouse macrophages after treatment
with soluble Ag85B, bare KFE8 nanofiber, and KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers.
During the induction of autophagy, a cytosolic form of LC3B (LC3B-I)
is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine
conjugate (LC3B-II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes.
When analyzed through western blot using antibodies against LC3B,
both bare KFE8 nanofiber and KFE8-Ag85B nanofibers showed increased
lipidation of LC3B in mouse macrophages as compared to that of soluble
Ag85B (Figure 2D).
Detection and the number of LC3-II-positive punctate structures in
the cell are considered to be an accurate autophagosome number and
marker for autophagy. Quantification of puncta showed significantly
higher numbers of LC3IIB puncta in WT MΦs treated with KFE8-Ag85B
nanofibers compared to controls (Figure 2E). Some puncta were also detected in Atg5–/– MΦs treated with Ag85B nanofibers,
presumably due to other ongoing cellular processes that involve Ag85B
nanofibers (Figure 2E). This is evident from the fact that IL-2 production was not fully
abrogated either in WT MΦs treated with autophagy inhibitors,
Atg5–/– MΦs, or Atg7–/– DCs, suggesting alternate mechanisms could be engaged in the intracellular
processing of peptide nanofibers.

Emerging evidence suggests
that macroautophagy could contribute
to antigen processing for MHC class I presentation. Using virus-infected
MΦs, it was demonstrated that viral proteins are not processed
only by the “classical” MHC class I presentation pathway
involving the proteosome.30 In late stages
of infection, autophagosomes form from the membrane of the outer nuclear
leaflet around virus particles and inhibition of Atg5 by siRNA leads
to loss of virus-specific CD8+ T cell stimulation.31 This suggests that macroautophagic cargo can gain access
to MHC class I presentation. To assess a role for macroautophagy in
MHC class I presentation of peptide nanofibers, we used the OVA peptide
(SIINFEKL, chicken egg ovalbumin 257–264) linked to the self-assembling
domain KFE8 and T cells from OT-I transgenic mice (receptors specific
for OVA). Data indicated significantly higher IL-2 production in MΦs
treated with KFE8-OVA compared with soluble control and was significantly
reduced in the presence of 3MA or Atg5–/– MΦs (Figure 3). This suggests a role for macroautophagy in the processing of peptide
nanofibers and MHC class I presentation, and presumably peptide fragments
resulting from macroautophagic processes are further degraded in the
proteasomes prior to MHC-loading and presentation. This was confirmed
using the proteosomal inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ), which led to a significant
reduction in IL-2 in MΦs treated with nanofibers compared to
that in MΦs treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3MA (Figure 3). No differences
in IL-2 levels were detected in WT or Atg5–/– MΦs treated with soluble OVA or in Atg5–/– MΦs treated with 3MA, BTZ, or rapamycin (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Autophagy is involved
in the processing and presentation of MHC
class I antigens linked to self-assembling peptides. Significantly
higher levels of IL-2 are detected in cultures treated with KFE8-OVA
compared to those in cultures treated with soluble OVA peptide. No
loss of IL-2 is observed in Atg5–/– macrophages
compared to that observed in WT when treated with soluble OVA, but
in the presence of 3MA or in Atg5–/– macrophages
treated with OVA-KFE8 a significant drop in IL-2 is observed. Also,
treatment with proteasome inhibitor BTZ also leads to loss of IL-2
in OVA-KFE8 treated macrophages. Addition of rapamycin to Atg5–/– macrophages treated with OVA-KFE8 does not
enhance IL-2 production as expected. *p < 0.05
by ANOVA using Tukey post-hoc test (n = 3 wells/group,
data representative of two experiments with similar results).

Normally, autophagy always occurs
at low basal levels to maintain
metabolic homeostasis in the cells.17 However,
under stressful situations, this process may be upregulated whereby
the occurrences of diseases like diabetes, neurodegeneration, myopathies
etc.19 is prevented. It has been demonstrated
that vaccines that engage autophagy are essential for the generation
and survival of influenza virus-specific memory B cells in mice and
triggering autophagy in APCs to process and present pathogen-derived
MHC II-restricted antigens that can stimulate cell-mediated immunity
in the host.24,32 Enhancing basal autophagy using
FDA-approved pharmacological interventions (rapamycin) or inducing
cytosolic aggregation of antigens (Ag85B in BCG) has been shown to
enhance T helper type 1-mediated host protection against M. tuberculosis (Mtb).24 On the basis of our data, we believe that following uptake by antigen-presenting
cells, nanofibers are readily sequestered into the phaghophores, which
expands to form a double-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome.
The autophagosome eventually fuses with the lysosome, resulting in
the formation of an autolysosome, where the sequestered nanofibers
are degraded by lysosomal proteases, leading to MHC class II presentation
and activation of CD4+T cells (Figure 4). We are tempted to hypothesize that similar processes
are involved in MHC class I presentation and that following macroautophagy
and lysosomal degradation, the vacuolar contents are further processed
by the proteasome to generate peptides for loading onto MHC class
I molecules (Figure 4). However, further studies are required to verify the exact mechanism.

Figure 4 Schematic
shows autophagy mechanisms involved in the processing
of peptide nanofibers in antigen-presenting cells and MHC class I
and MHC class II presentation.

Future studies aim to investigate how self-assembly can be
controlled
to vary physicochemical properties (size, shape, and stability) of
peptide nanofibers and how changes in physical properties of peptide
nanofibers influence autophagy-mediated adjuvant potential and immunogenicity.
Other pathways of autophagy in antigen-presenting cells remain to
be investigated and an extended understanding of how peptide nanofiber
vaccines are processed and presented in vivo will be crucial for their
clinical translation in the near future. Further, triggering other
immunological pathways in conjunction with autophagy through incorporation
of TLR agonists could boost the immune response and vaccine efficacy.

Materials
and Methods
Peptide Synthesis
Peptides KFE8 (FKFEFKFE), NapFFK
(NapFFKYp, Nap = napthylalanine, Yp = phosphotyrosine), Ag85B (FQDAYNAAGGHNAVF),
OVA (SIINFEKL), KFE8-Ag85B (KFE8-GGAAY-Ag85B), KFE8-OVA (KFE8-GGAAY-OVA),
and NapFFK-Ag85B (NapFFK-GG-Ag85B) were synthesized on a CEM Blue
(Matthews, NC) microwave synthesizer using standard solid phase Fmoc
chemistry on Rink amide resin. Fomc-protected amino acids with standard
side chain protecting groups, fluorescent dyes, and resins were purchased
from Novabiochem (Billerica, MA). Peptides were cleaved using cleavage
cocktail containing 95% TFA, 2.5% water, and 2.5% triisopropyl silane
for 90 min at room temperature (RT) and precipitated in ice-cold diethyl
ether. Crude peptides were purified by reverse phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a water/acetonitrile gradient on
a C18 column (∼80% purity) and confirmed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Figure S7). All peptides were stored at −20
°C until further use.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Stock solutions
of 1 mM peptides were allowed to fibrillize in water overnight at
room temperature, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 0.2
mM, and applied to 200 mesh copper grids with carbon support film
(Quantifoil). The grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate,
and imaged on a JEM1400 TEM (JEOL) equipped with LaB6 electron
gun and Ultrascan 1000 camera (Gatan).

Circular Dichrosim Spectroscopy
A Jasco 815 circular
dichroism spectropolarimeter was used with 0.1 cm path length quartz
cells. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the peptides in
ultrapure water (2 mM) and further diluting to a working concentration
(0.25–1 mM) in PBS buffer. The wavelength range was 190–260
nm, the scanning speed was 0.5 nm/s, and the bandwidth was 0.5 nm.
Each spectrum is the average of three scans. Under the solution conditions
described, adequate signal strength was observed at wavelengths up
to 200 nm. The solvent background was subtracted and resultant CD
signals plotted.

Mouse Primary Bone Marrow-Derived MΦs
and DCs
C57BL6 mice (wild type) were purchased from Jackson
labs. Autophagy-deficient
mice (Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre) and their corresponding wild-type controls (Atg5flox/flox) (generated by
Dr. Noboru Mizushima, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,
University of Tokyo) were a kind gift from Dr. Rong Fang at UTMB.
Dr. Jin Wang at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston) provided the
murine Atg7–/– dendritic cells. To generate
BMDCs, femurs and tibias from mice were flushed using Iscove’s
modification of Dulbecco medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, gentamycin, and 20 ng/mL mouse recombinant
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Following
RBC lysis with ACK buffer, the cells were cultured for a week in IMDM,
with medium changed every 2 days. On day 8, cells were harvested and
fractionated using anti-CD11c magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) to
separate DCs from MΦs according to manufacturer protocols. MΦs
were then plated onto 24-well plates or eight-chambered slides (for
microscopy) in IMDM (with GM-CSF) for an additional 4 days, after
which the medium was replaced (without GM-CSF). Cells were rested
and used as well-differentiated monolayers.

Antigen-Presentation Assays
This protocol has been
extensively described in our previous publication in detail.21 Briefly, M. tuberculosis Ag85B epitope-specific T cell hybridoma (BB7) (a kind gift from
Drs. Harding and Boom, Case Western Reserve University) was maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone Labs), 50 μM 2-mecaptoethanol,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES buffer,
10 μg/mL penicillin, and 5 μg/mL gentamicin. MΦs
were plated in 24-well plates and used as naive cells or were incubated
for 16 h with peptides Ag85B or KFE8-Ag85B. The peptide concentration
in the medium was adjusted so that all groups received 25 nmol of
Ag85B. MΦs were then washed thrice with PBS and overlaid with
BB7 T cells at a ratio of 1:10 (MΦs:BB7 cells). The supernatant
was collected 24 h later. IL-2 levels were quantified using a sandwich
ELISA kit (R&D Systems). For loss and gain of function studies
3-methyl adenine, bafilomycin, or rapamycin were added 30 min prior
to incubation with peptides. Inhibition of Lamp2A was carried out
by incubating the MΦs in siRNA duplex solution (30 min), followed
by siRNA (5 h) and knock down was allowed to progress for 24 h before
addition of peptides.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Immunostaining
was performed
using chamber slides, as described in detail elsewhere.24 Briefly, MΦs were incubated with peptide
solutions for 16 h, washed 3 times with PBS, and fixed in 4% fresh
paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin
and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS (supplemented with 2% normal mouse serum)
and stained with primary LC3B antibody for 18 h at 4 °C (1:500,
Cat # 3868; Cell Signaling). MΦs were then counterstained with
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (#711-095-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch)
for 2 h, washed, fixed with methanol, and examined for LC3B puncta
using a fluorescent microscope.

Western Blot
Soluble
Ag85B, bare KFE8 nanofiber, and
KFE8-Ag85B treated (24 h) primary mouse macrophage lysates were subjected
to western blotting using antibodies specific for mouse LC3-I/LC3-II
(Cell Signaling # 3738). Blots were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody (Cell Signaling # 7074) and
assessed via chemiluminescence. A protein loading control of β-actin
(Cell Signaling # 4967) was also included.

Statistical Analysis
All experimental data were plotted
using GraphPad Prism software and represented as mean ± SEM,
and statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with Tukey or Bonferroni
post-hoc test. Statistical significance was assigned at p values <0.05.
