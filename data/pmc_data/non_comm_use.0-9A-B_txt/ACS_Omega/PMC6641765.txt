In
this study, the effects of ligand phase, morphology, and temperature
on the elastic modulus of free-standing alkanethiol-capped gold nanoparticle
membranes are reported. Langmuir films of 2.5 nm gold nanoparticles
capped with tetradecanethiol were prepared at temperatures above and
below the phase transition temperature (Tm) of the ligand shell and transferred to holey carbon grids (containing
1.2 μm holes) to form free-standing membranes. Force–indentation
measurements are used to measure the elastic modulus of the membranes
using an atomic force microscope in the temperature range 10–40
°C. These films are compared with membranes of dodecanethiol-capped
gold nanoparticles, which do not undergo a ligand order–disorder
transition in the temperature range investigated. The ligand phase
effect is observed in the tetradecanethiol-capped gold nanoparticle
films, where an abrupt change in the elastic modulus is seen near Tm. The temperature (relative to Tm) during the fabrication of the films is determined to
play an important role in tuning the mechanical strength of these
films in this temperature range by both changing the nature of the
interparticle interactions and by affecting microscale film morphology.

Introduction
Nanoparticle films,
often made from metallic core nanoparticles
surrounded by an organic ligand shell, have been of interest in a
wide range of applications. Recent experiments have shown that freely
suspended membranes formed from these films, held together purely
by van der Waals interactions, exhibit remarkable mechanical stability
with large elastic modulus similar to that of glassy polymers.1−3 Simulation studies4−6 have shown that the ligand–ligand van der
Waals interactions play a dominant role in defining the mechanical
strength of these films. The ligands therefore cannot be merely treated
as spacers counteracting the core-to-core attraction but rather the
key strength-building components to these films. Most of the experimental
studies on suspended nanoparticle membranes have been carried out
at room temperature. To date, the effects of temperature, and thus
ligand dynamics, on the mechanical stability of these films have not
been explicitly measured. When measured as a solid-state powder, n-alkanethiol ligand shells on the nanoparticle core transition
from an ordered state, where the ligands are primarily in all-trans configuration, to a disordered state, where there
are more gauche conformers, at a characteristic chain-melting transition
temperature (Tm).7 This chain-melting transition depends on the shape and size of the
nanoparticle core as well as the carbon chain length of alkanethiol
molecules.7,8 Comeau and Meli have reported a significant
decrease in collapse pressure of nanoparticle monolayers formed and
compressed as temperature is increased beyond the reported Tm of the ligand shell.9 There are a number of simulation studies on the effects of varying
temperature10,11and ligand end group6,10 on the mechanical properties of these membranes. Landman and Luedtke
have shown from molecular dynamics simulations that for temperatures
below the estimated Tm, the moduli of
three-dimensional (3D) superlattices of dodecanethiol-capped gold
particles (AuNPC12, ∼3 nm size cores) are on the
order of several gigapascals (GPa), comparable to those of plastics.5 They also show that there is an abrupt decrease
in Young’s modulus when temperature exceeds the transition
point.

To investigate the role of ligand phase in the mechanical
strength
of these films both during and postfilm assembly, we fabricated tetradecanethiol-capped
gold nanoparticle (AuNPC14) membranes at temperatures above
and below the reported7Tm (22 °C) and determined their elastic moduli by
atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation as a function of temperature
following the method established by Jaeger and co-workers.1 Membranes were prepared according to established
procedures using the Langmuir film balance9 followed by horizontal transfer12 to
a holey carbon grid as a membrane support. Films of ∼2 nm nanoparticles,
as opposed to larger nanoparticles (>4 nm), formed using the Langmuir
balance have been shown to contain numerous void spaces which, along
with the microscale film morphology, can vary as the spreading conditions
change (i.e., with spreading solvent, temperature).9,13,14 Unlike nearly defect-free nanoparticle lattices
observed in other preparation methods,1 preparation of the membranes by transfer from a Langmuir film offers
the advantage of a characteristic surface pressure versus area isotherm
prior to deposition as well as a defined surface pressure prior to
deposition. Furthermore, preparation at different temperatures may
result in different film morphologies and properties, which may shed
further light upon the temperature dependence of the film strength.
Through comparison with membranes formed from dodecanethiol-capped
gold nanoparticles (AuNPC12), which have a reported7Tm of 3 °C and
thus remain in a ligand-disordered phase throughout the temperature
range measured, we determine the extent of ligand phase effects on
the temperature dependence of the film strength.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
topography of these membranes suspended on the holey carbon support.
The line profile (in red) indicates that the membranes drape over
the holes but recess below the carbon film to a depth of around 30
nm, as has been observed for membranes prepared from other methods.1,2 AuNPC14 films were prepared at two temperatures spanning
their expected Tm (10 and 30 °C,
which will be represented as AuNPC1410 and AuNPC1430, respectively) whereas films of AuNPC12 were prepared at 25 °C.

The membrane indentation was carried out in the temperature
range
10–40 °C in increments of 5 °C. The membranes were
first indented at 25 °C followed by higher temperatures, and
for each temperature, the grids were left to equilibrate on the temperature
stage for an hour before measurements. After the indentation measurements
at 40 °C, the grids were allowed to cool to room temperature.
The remaining temperature measurements were carried out the next day
starting again at 25 °C and going down to 10 °C in decrements
of 5 °C. The 25 °C measurement was repeated again the next
day. Indeed, the multiple measurements on the films at 25 °C
yield similar elastic modulus values, indicating that these films
are robust and the temperature effects on these films are reversible
in this temperature range.

The AuNPC12 membranes,
indented at 25 °C, yield
an elastic modulus, E, of 0.33 ± 0.03 GPa. The
variation of modulus as a function of temperature for the film is
shown in Figure 2 (right-most
bars). With increasing temperature, a decrease in the value of E was seen, with the highest value of 0.82 ± 0.11 GPa
at 10 °C and the lowest value of 0.19 ± 0.03 GPa observed
at 40 °C. Simulations by Landman and Luedtke5 of 3D superlattices of ∼3 nm dodecanethiol-capped
gold particles show that at temperatures greater than the Tm the elastic modulus has little dependence
upon temperature; however, the modulus increases up to several gigapascals
with decreasing temperature when below the estimated Tm. We observe a decrease in E with increasing T in a smooth manner, as predicted by Salerno and Grest,6 though the values of E obtained
for our system are lower than the values predicted by both the Grest
and Landman studies. This difference cannot likely be associated with
the difference in core–core interactions arising from different
nanoparticle sizes as a number of studies1,4,5 have shown that core–core interactions
account for less than 10% of the observed strength for nanoparticles
in the 2–6 nm range. It is more likely that core size differences
would manifest in other ways that are of consequence to the cohesive
strength in the membranes, such as altering the ligand dynamics,8 as well as forming a hole-ridden film morphology,9 as seen in our films, which may in fact offer
other attractive attributes to the film properties.

for AuNPC1430 (left), AuNPC1410 (middle), and AuNPC12 (right). The error bars in the
figure represent the standard error of 15–20 membrane measurements.

In the case of AuNPC1410 and AuNPC1430 membranes,
the temperature dependence of E differed markedly
from that for the AuNPC12 membranes.
With increasing temperature, an abrupt decrease in E was observed in both of the former near the Tm, whereas the latter varies smoothly throughout. This abrupt
decrease occurs around 15–20 °C for the AuNPC1430 membranes and
between 10 and 15 °C for AuNPC1410. From Figure 2, it can be seen that the AuNPC1430 membranes have the highest
strength at 10 °C and the lowest strength at 40 °C and thus
a more dramatic temperature dependence than that for the other two
membranes.

The organization and dynamics of nanoparticle alkylthiol
ligand
shells on gold nanoparticles has been the subject of renewed interest
in light of bundling,15 variations in ligand
density/surface coverage,16,17 interesting solubility,18 and composition-based ligand phase separation
phenomena.19 The ligand density is expected
to play a significant role in determining nanoparticle interactions
as has been shown for 2–3 nm core Au nanoparticles with ligand
densities similar to those of the particles used here (i.e., 3.9 nm–2 by our estimation).16,20 However, given
the reversible nature of our measured E values, we
expect that ligand density is not varying in this experiment. Rather,
the extent of bundling of the alkane chains, expected for isolated
nanoparticles at temperatures below the order–disorder transition,
is the key parameter determining the prominence of inter- versus intraparticle
ligand interactions in these films. Molecular dynamics simulations
suggest that by unbundling at elevated temperatures, the ligand chains
stretch out increasingly radially to maximize their accessible volume.6,15 With more radial extension, the ligand packing density also decreases
radially from the nanoparticle surface.21

Our experimental observations suggest that the method of film
preparation,
in particular the temperature during film formation, affects the temperature
dependence of the resulting film elastic modulus. The greater moduli
obtained for the AuNPC1430 films at lower temperatures indicate that more van der Waals
attractive forces are present. As the AuNPC1430 film is formed at T > Tm, the extended ligand chains
(as
opposed to closely packed bundles) may enable interdigitation between
adjacent particles during film formation and compression, forming
a closer-packed state compared to that of the AuNPC1410 film. Indeed, the surface
pressure versus area isotherms of the Langmuir films (Figure 3) show that film formation
at the elevated temperature leads to less area per nanoparticle at
the point of transfer (15 mN/m). As the film is cooled to lower temperatures,
the interdigitated ligands can order without necessitating the degree
of chain tilt seen in two-dimensional alkanethiol monolayers or bundling,
as expected on the nanoparticle facets in isolation. In contrast,
when the film is formed at T < Tm (AuNPC1410), chain bundling within facets of the nanoparticle surface
may be dominating the nature of nanoparticle–nanoparticle interactions,
limiting attractive van der Waals interactions to occur around the
edges of the Au core where there is free volume and around the edges
of the ligand bundles. Such ordering within facets and their van der
Waals interactions are similarly expected to be present in the dry
AuNP powders, which give rise to the measured transition temperatures.7 If the nanoparticles in the AuNPC1430 films are more
interdigitated and closely packed during their formation, lowering
the temperature can give rise to a more tightly packed ligand structure,
resulting in a stronger membrane (1.20 ± 0.17 GPa at 10 °C
vs 0.84 ± 0.29 for AuNPC1410).

Figure 3 Isotherms of AuNPC1430 (left), AuNPC1410 (middle), and AuNPC12 (right).

Once past the Tm, the elastic moduli
decrease in a smooth fashion (Figure 2). However, the AuNPC1410 and AuNPC12 films approach similar
values of elastic modulus at temperatures around 30 °C and up,
whereas that of the AuNPC1430 film continues to drop (Figure 2). This may be understood again
by considering the difference in the film morphology and the nature
of the nanoparticle–nanoparticle interactions as a result of
different film formation conditions. For example, as the temperature
is increased past the Tm, the ligand bundles
start to disorder and stretch radially. The highly interdigitated
AuNPC1430 films
would be driven to expand, given their closer-packed state during
formation, to alleviate steric repulsions and accommodate greater
conformational degrees of freedom as the temperature continues to
increase. Improved membrane expansion has been predicted in simulations
of spherical membrane formation from similar gold nanoparticles when
their ligands are extended radially from the gold surface.20 Such a membrane expansion would thus continue
to lower the elastic modulus in the AuNPC1430 membranes compared to that in the others,
as seen in Figure 2. Simulations by Salerno and Grest6 also
suggest that lattice expansion occurs rapidly with increasing temperature
once the ligands unbundle and begin to disorder. However, the driving
force for membrane expansion is much less in the AuNPC1410 membrane system
due to the lesser degree of interdigitation in these films when they
were formed.

Interestingly, the elastic moduli of the AuNPC1410 membranes have
a similar temperature
dependence as that of AuNPC12 membranes at T ≫ Tm. The horizontal offset in
the isotherms shown in Figure 3 suggests that the spreading conditions during film formation
lead to significant changes in both the nanoparticle packing and microscale
film morphology. The AFM images of the film morphologies (Figure 4) indicate that the
AuNPC1430 film
has smaller void spaces that are more evenly distributed throughout
the film compared to those in AuNPC1410 and AuNPC12, which contain fewer but larger holes. Further
imaging of the films at the top and bottom ends of the temperature
range show no qualitative change in the film morphologies (provided
in the Supporting Information, Figure S3), yet subtle changes in packing parameters would not be readily
obtained from such images. The greater distribution of void spaces
in the AuNPC1430 films most likely enables greater lattice expansion, resulting in
a less dense film and the significantly lower elastic moduli observed
at the highest temperatures.

Conclusions
The
cohesive film strength (via elastic modulus) of gold nanoparticle
monolayer membranes was found to decrease with increasing temperature.
The measurements are reversible throughout the temperature range measured,
suggesting that the ligand surface coverage of the nanoparticles remains
constant during the measurements. The ligand order–disorder
phase transition clearly affects the temperature dependence of the
elastic modulus, where it was observed to increase by as much as 10×
at temperatures below the cited Tm. Moreover,
the method of film preparation was found to tune the temperature dependence,
where membranes prepared at T > Tm have the greatest range in observed elastic modulus,
whereas membranes prepared at T < Tm have approximately one-third of the range. By carefully
considering the compression isotherms, resulting AFM-measured film
morphologies, and comparison with both experimental and simulated
studies of the dynamics of alkanethiolate gold nanoparticles, we propose
that film preparation conditions play a very significant role in the
resulting membrane strength by virtue of altering the degree of interdigitation
during film formation as well as by altering the size and distribution
of defect spaces within the films. In particular, smaller and well-distributed
defects appear to improve the range of elastic moduli possible from
these films.

Experimental Section
Materials
Gold(III)
chloride trihydrate (>99.9%), sodium
borohydride (NaBH4, reagent grade), tetraoctylammonium
bromide (98%), chloroform (HPLC grade), dodecanethiol, and tetradecanethiol
(reagent grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Canada. Anhydrous
ethanol was obtained from Commercial Alcohols, Canada. Toluene (99.5%)
was purchased from ACP Chemicals Inc., and benzene (99%) was obtained
from Caledon Laboratory Chemicals. All chemicals were used as received.
Deionization of distilled water was performed using a Millipore filtration
system to yield water with 18.2 MΩ resistivity. QUANTIFOIL holey
carbon grids (orthogonal array of 1.2 μm diameter holes separated
by 1.3 μm, mounted on a 300 mesh Ni TEM grid) were purchased
from Ted Pella, Inc.

Gold Nanoparticle Synthesis
A modified
Brust–Schiffrin
two phase synthesis was followed, as outlined in detail previously.9,22 Briefly, a toluene solution of tetraoctylammonium bromide (0.05
M, 80 mL) was added to an aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (0.03 M, 30 mL) and stirred until the aqueous phase
remained colorless (approximately 25 min). The desired thiol (0.84
mmol) was added, and the solution was stirred 2–4 h. Once the
organic phase turned colorless, a fresh aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.4 M, 25 mL) was added dropwise at a rate of 2–3
drops/s. The solution quickly turned dark brown and was left to stir
in an open flask for 2–3 h. The organic phase was separated,
concentrated to <10 mL, diluted with approximately 200 mL of anhydrous
ethanol, and kept at 4 °C overnight. The particle aggregates
were collected using centrifugation and washed repeatedly with anhydrous
ethanol. Washing was repeated until the product no longer revealed
unbound thiol by 1H-NMR using a 200 MHz Varian Oxford spectrometer.
The nanoparticles were imaged using a JEOL 2011 scanning transmission
electron microscope (200 keV, Gatan 4 k × 4 k Ultrascan digital
camera) and determined to have an average core diameter of 2.5 nm,
with standard deviation of 0.4 nm, and a size distribution typical
for this synthetic preparation (Supporting Information Figure S2).

Membrane Preparation
Nanoparticle films were prepared
using a NIMA trough filled with 18.2 MΩ deionized water. The
trough and barriers were wiped with chloroform and rinsed twice with
water. Nanoparticle solutions (0.6 mg/mL) were freshly prepared with
chloroform, and 180 μL of the solution was added dropwise to
the surface of the water in ca. 3–5 μL drops every 15
s. The solution was left for 20 min to allow for solvent evaporation
and equilibration. For comparison, films were prepared where the temperature
of the water subphase was maintained at either 10 or 30 °C using
a Julabo F25 water circulator. A 1 cm wide filter paper was used as
a Wilhelmy plate to detect the surface tension of the subphase, and
film compression was performed at a rate of 10 cm2/min.
Surface pressure versus area/nanoparticle isotherms were obtained
prior to transfer, for which we estimate the number of nanoparticles
spread at the air–water interface by assuming 1:3 thiol/surface
Au atoms on a sphere of equivalent diameter. Similarly, we estimate
the ligand density at the nanoparticle surface to be 3.9 nm–2, in agreement with experimentally determined values obtained by
Torelli et al.23

The holey carbon
grid was secured to a freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG) substrate using small pieces of double-sided tape.
The substrate was then secured to a clean glass support to raise the
grid to within 2 mm of the air–water interface. The entire
system was placed in the trough prior to filling with water and spreading
the nanoparticle solution. Horizontal film transfer (from below the
interface12) was achieved by stopping the
compression and maintaining a surface pressure of 15 mN/m, then suctioning
off the water from beyond the barrier, thus allowing the nanoparticle
film to settle on the grid. Often the films would fracture upon drying;
however, there remained many membranes intact within the many mesh
spaces of the grid. The grids were left to dry in vacuum for about
an hour and then imaged by atomic force microscopy.

AFM Imaging
and Force–Indentation Measurements
AFM imaging and
nanoindentation experiments were performed using
a Park Systems XE-100 AFM mounted on a vibration isolation system
(Minus K technology). The spring constant of the AFM cantilever was
determined using the dimensional method,24 where the length and width of the tips were obtained from scanning
electron microscopy images. Silicon cantilevers with conical tips
(NSC36, Mikromasch) and spring constants in the range 0.8–2.2
N/m were used for indentation. The membranes (1.2 μm diameter)
were first imaged in noncontact mode to position the tip near the
geometric center of the membranes (to within approximately 100 nm)
before switching to contact mode to perform force–indentation
measurements. The loading velocity of the AFM tip was set to 1 μm/s.
The membrane deformation, δ, was calculated by subtracting the
tip deflection from the ZPiezo displacement: , where k is the cantilever
spring constant.25 The force versus indentation
data was recorded for about 15–20 membranes for each film at
each temperature, and at least five sets of indentation data were
collected for each membrane. Films transferred to silicon substrates
for assessment of film morphology were imaged within 15 min of transfer
in noncontact mode using silicon probes (Park Systems, PPP-NCHR) with
a resonant frequency of 320–350 kHz and a tip radius <10
nm and reimaged after 1–2 days to verify stability.

To
measure the variation of mechanical strength of these membranes with
temperature, force–distance curves of these membranes were
obtained at various temperatures using a LDT-5948 temperature control
system (ILX Lightwave). As HOPG has a low out-of-plane thermal conductivity,
colloidal graphite was used to make thermal contacts between the grid
and AFM temperature stage. Grid temperatures were verified independently
using a thermocouple placed in direct contact manually, and a variation
of less than ±2 °C was found across the temperature range
used.

All indentation curves were analyzed using the classical
circle
plate theory26 to determine the film elastic
modulus, E. In this model, force can be expressed
as a function of indentation, as F = aδ3 + bδ, where δ is
deformation due to the applied force, F. Parameter a can be defined as , where E is Young’s
modulus and h and R are the thickness
and radius of the membrane, respectively. The thickness, h, is defined as h = r + 2l, where r represents the mean nanoparticle
diameter (2.5 nm), l represents the length of all-trans
alkanethiol ligands (∼1.1 nm), and R, the
radius of membrane, was 0.6 μm as defined by the holey carbon
supports and verified by AFM. Parameter b is defined
as b = σ0πh, where σ0 is the prestrain in the film introduced
due to the boundary conditions imposed on the membrane due to the
supports. This term dominates the force–displacement curve
in the linear regime (low values of δ), and for higher values
of deformation, the cubic term dominates the curve and prestrain becomes
negligible.1 A typical force–indentation
curve with the model fitting is provided in the Supporting Information. By fitting the indentation curves
with this model, Young’s modulus, E, is determined
from the cubic regime of the curve.
