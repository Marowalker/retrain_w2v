Splitting of water into hydrogen
and oxygen has become a strategic
research topic. In the two semi-reactions of water splitting, water
oxidation is preferred to the four-electron-transfer process with
a higher overpotential (η) and is the decisive step in water
splitting. Therefore, efficient water oxidation catalysts must be
developed. IrOx and RuOx catalysts are currently the most efficient catalysts in
water oxidation. However, the limited reserve and high prices of precious
metals, such as Ir and Ru, limit future large-scale industrial production
of water oxidation catalysts. In this study, we tune inert Ni-foam
into highly active NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as water oxidation
catalysts via three-step strategy (surface acid-treating, electroplating,
and electrooxidation). NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as water oxidation
catalysts only require η of 257 mV to reach a current density
of 10 mA cm–2, which is superior to that of IrO2/Ni-foam (280 mV). The high electrochemically active surface
area (72.50 cm2) and roughness factor demonstrate abundant
interfaces in NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures, thus accelerating water
oxidation activity. The small value (4.8 Ω cm2) of
charge transfer resistance (Rct) indicate
that fast electronic exchange occurs between NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures
catalyst and reaction of water oxidation. Hydrogen-to-oxygen volume
ratios (approximately 2:1) indicate an almost overall water splitting
by the double-electrode system. Faraday efficiency of H2 or O2 is close to 90% at 2:1 hydrogen-to-oxygen volume
ratio. NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures exhibit good stability. The results
provide significance in fundamental research and practical applications
in solar water splitting, artificial photoelectrochemical cells, and
electrocatalysts.

Introduction
Environmental pollution
and ecological damage has become serious
with large consumption of fossil energy. Development of clean energy
is an effective mean of solving the above dilemma. Hydrogen, as clean
energy, not only gives high calorific value of combustion but also
brings clean combustion product (H2O). Hydrogen can be
produced via various industrial methods, such as water electrolysis
and conversion from coal gasification, heavy oil, and natural gas.

However, the energy consumed by hydrogen-producing reactions is
higher than the energy generated. Hydrogen can be released from water,
which is the most abundant resource on earth. Therefore, water splitting
has become a strategic research topic.

The reaction of water
splitting is H2O → H2 + 1/2O2, ΔrGmθ = 237.18 kJ mol–1. Standard molar Gibbs free energy
of water splitting is much higher
than zero, and the reaction cannot be spontaneous in terms of thermodynamic
analysis. The reaction needs additional electrical work. The least
theoretical voltage for water splitting is V = −ΔrGmθ/nF = 1.23 V. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) cause overpotential (ηOER) when the
current significantly increases in terms of the dynamic perspective.
ηOER not only wastes considerable energy but also
reduces the rate of water splitting. Water can be converted into hydrogen
and oxygen by electrocatalysis,1,2 photocatalysis,3,4 and photoelectrocatalysis.5,6 Of these two semi-reactions
of water splitting, water oxidation (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e–) represents the
four-electron-transfer process with a higher ηOER and is the decisive step. Therefore, efficient water oxidation catalysts
must be developed. IrOx and RuOx catalysts are currently the most efficient
catalysts in water oxidation. However, IrOx and RuOx also present two problems.
First, catalytic performance and long-term stability of IrOx and RuOx electrocatalysts
cannot meet industrialization applications. Second, the limited reserve
and high prices of precious metals, such as Ir and Ru, limit future
large-scale industrial production. The development of efficient, low-cost,
and stable water oxidation catalysts is particularly crucial to solve
the above problems. Three main ways can be considered: the development
of efficient nonprecious metal catalysts (such as Fe, Co, Ni, Mn,
W, and other transition-metal compound catalysts and doped graphene)
to replace precious metal catalysts, increasing utilization of the
unit surface and unit mass of noble metal catalysts (such as catalysts
with single-atom dispersion) by controlling comprehensively the size
and morphology of water oxidation catalysts and enhancing the unit
mass activity of precious metal catalysts by the synergy between other
active components and precious metals.

Nickel (Ni) foam exhibits
excellent corrosion resistance to the
media of carbonate, nitrate, chloride, vinegar salts, other alkaline,
and neutral solutions. On the other hand, Ni-foam is stable in atmosphere,
fresh water, and sea water. In addition, Ni-foam possesses good conductivity
and three-dimensional structure. The above characteristics facilitate
the contact of H2O with Ni-foam, thereby increasing the
contact area and efficiency of water splitting. Therefore, we used
Ni-foam as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation. However, electrocatalytic
activity of Ni-foam is low. Various research groups have loaded different
catalysts, such as transition-metal complexes,7−14 metal–organic frameworks,15 and
trimetallic phytate,16 on Ni-foam. Recently,
studies have shown that the electrocatalytic activity can be improved
by incorporating elements of Fe and Ni.17 In this study, we tuned inert Ni-foam into highly active NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructures as water oxidation catalysts via a three-step strategy
(surface acid-treating and electroplating (EP) and electrooxidation).

Results
and Discussion
In this study, we tuned inert Ni-foam into
highly active NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructures as water oxidation catalysts via a three-step strategy
(as shown in Figure 1). The detailed preparation processes of acid treatment (AT) Ni-foam,
electroplating, and electrooxidation are provided in the Experimental Section. Morphologies of Ni-foam (Figure 2a), Ni-foam-AT 5
min (Figure 2b), and
NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures (Figure 2c) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Figure 2d–f
show that the Ni-foam contain abundant ellipse-like three-dimensional
pores. The size of pore is from 100 to 500 μm. Figure 2e indicates that the specific
surface area of this multipore structure was larger than that of the
flat structure. The multipore structure increased the contact area
between H2O and Ni-foam or active sites. These enhanced
the catalytic activity of Ni-foam. We doubled the SEM magnification
from 160 to 4650 times for precise observation. The Ni-foam surface
is relatively smooth, as shown in the amplified SEM image (Figure 2g). We treated the
Ni-foam with mixed acid to further increase its specific surface area,
as shown in Figure 2e,h. Results show that uneven gaps are formed on the Ni-foam surface
after AT, indicating that the Ni-foam surface after AT became significantly
rough and large. Figure 2f,i depict the NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures surface containing a
layer of particles, which should be FeOOH.

evolution from inert Ni-foam into highly
active NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as water oxidation catalysts via

Surface element distribution was
analyzed by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) to prove the presence of FeOOH on NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructures. A layer of particles was observed again on the NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructure surface, as shown in Figure 3a. Green and purple represent the distributions
of Ni and Fe elements in EDS, respectively. Green (Ni) covered almost
the entire field of view in Figure 3b. However, numerous spots on the Ni-foam surface were
not green, indicating that the Ni-foam surface was decorated with
other elements. A large number of small purple dots are observed in Figure 3c, implying that
the Ni-foam surface was plated with iron. We provide the XRD of NiOOH/FeOOH
on Ni-foam in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Diffraction peaks were not observed except for pattern
of Ni. The result indicated that the phase of NiOOH/FeOOH was amorphous
or the loading quality of NiOOH/FeOOH on Ni-foam is very small. In
addition, the sample was too strong to fall off during ultrasound.
Thus, we have not carried out high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy. XPS has the potential to distinguish between metallic
iron, various iron oxides, and iron hydroxides. Surface chemical state
of pristine Ni-foam was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Ni 2p XPS curve was fitted by the “XPS peak”
software to determine the ascription of peaks, as shown in Figure 3d. The detailed fitting
data are listed in Table S1. Four different
peaks were observed in the Ni 2p XPS curve of Ni-foam. The peak with
45.6% at 852.00 eV corresponded to the low binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 in literature.18

2p XPS curve of pristine Ni-foam. (e) Ni 2p XPS curve of NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructures. (f) Fe 2p XPS curve of NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures.

The peak with 15.0% at 858.60
eV corresponded to the high binding
energy of Ni 2p3/2 in literature.19 The peak with 21.6% at 870.17 eV corresponded to the low binding
energy of Ni 2p1/2 in literature.20 The peak with 17.8% at 877.65 eV corresponded to the high binding
energy of Ni 2p1/2 in literature.20 The above results indicated that Ni on the Ni-foam surface was mostly
Ni 2p3/2. Surface chemical states of NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures
electrocatalyst were analyzed by XPS. Ni 2p XPS curve was fitted by
the XPS peak software, as shown in Figure 3e. The fitting data are listed in Table S2. Four different binding energy peaks
were observed in the Ni 2p XPS curve of NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures.
The peak with 37.0% at 855.60 eV corresponded to the low binding energy
of NiOOH 2p3/2 in literature.21 The peak with 26.9% at 861.40 eV corresponded to the high binding
energy of NiOOH 2p3/2 in literature.21 The peak with 17.0% at 873.10 eV corresponded to the low
binding energy of NiOOH 2p1/2 in literature.21 The peak with 19.1% at 879.70 eV corresponded
to the high binding energy of NiOOH 2p1/2 in literature.21 Comparison between fitting results of pristine
Ni-foam and NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures proved the existence of NiOOH
on the NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures. Surface chemical states of Fe
on NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures electrocatalyst were analyzed by XPS.
The Fe 2p XPS curve was fitted by the XPS peak software, as shown
in Figure 3f. The detailed
fitting data are listed in Table S3. Three
different peaks were observed in the Fe 2p XPS curve. The peak with
49.9% at 711.50 eV corresponded to the FeOOH 2p3/2 in literature.22 The peak with 48.8% at 724.30 eV corresponded
to the FeOOH 2p1/2 in literature.22 The peak with 1.3% at 707.00 eV corresponded to the low binding
energy of O2/Fe 2p3/2 in literature.22 Comparison of fitting results of pristine Ni-foam
and NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures implied that FeOOH existed on the
surface of NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures. The O 1s peak of the XPS
spectrum has been discussed as shown in Figure S2. Two different peaks at 527.1 and 529.2 eV are observed
in the O 1s XPS curve of Ni-foam, which corresponded to the binding
energy of adsorbed oxygen on Ni-foam. The peak is observed in the
O 1s XPS curve of NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures, which can be fitted
into two peaks at 530.6 eV for NiOOH and 531.5 eV for FeOOH.23 We further verify the successful synthesis of
NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures by photoelectric response. An obvious
photocurrent response is observed when NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures
are illuminated under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100
mW cm–2 (Figure S3).

Figure 4a shows
the OER characteristics of different electrodes in 1 M NaOH at a scan
rate of 1 mV s–1, with the scan direction from positive
to negative on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. For
comparison, pristine Ni-foam, Ni-foam-AT 1 min, Ni-foam-AT 2 min,
Ni-foam-AT 5 min, Ni-foam-AT 8 min, Pt on Ni-foam (Pt/Ni-foam, made
by chemical reduction), and IrO2 on Ni-foam (IrO2/Ni-foam, made by hydrothermal method) electrodes were also studied.
In a three-electrode configuration, pristine Ni-foam, Ni-foam-AT 1
min, Ni-foam-AT 2 min, Ni-foam-AT 5 min, Ni-foam-AT 8 min, Pt/Ni-foam,
and IrO2/Ni-foam electrodes required ηOER of 580, 390, 430, 430, 410, 410, and 280 mV, respectively (as shown
in Table 1), to reach
a (projected geometric area) current density of 10 mA cm–2. The ηOER value of IrO2/Ni-foam was
the smallest. The results showed that the ηOER of
Ni-foam-AT 1 min was 130 mV more than that of the IrO2/Ni-foam
electrode. The ηOER of the Ni-foam-AT 1 min electrode
was nearly the same as that of Pt/Ni-foam for OER. All AT-electrodes
showed improved OER performances compared with that of pristine Ni-foam.
The reason of reductive peaks observed in the linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) curves of all tested samples except Ni-foam is the reduction
of oxidation state of Ni-foam by mixed-acid treatment and electrooxidation.
Pure Ni is not an oxidation state and its surface is not oxidized,
so we did not observe a reduction peak. Figure 4b provides the corresponding Tafel plots.
We fitted the linear regions in the LSV curves of all samples to the
Tafel equation to measure the corresponding Tafel slopes. The Tafel
slopes of pristine Ni-foam, Ni-foam-AT 1 min, Ni-foam-AT 2 min, Ni-foam-AT
5 min, Ni-foam-AT 8 min, Pt/Ni-foam, and IrO2/Ni-foam electrode
are 242.9, 231.3, 230.2, 239.4, 197.8, 267.0, and 194.1 mV dec–1, respectively.

ηOER of 390, 330, 300, 290, 290, 257, and 280 mV,
respectively, to reach a (projected geometric area) current density
of 10 mA cm–2. The Tafel slopes (Figure 4d) of Ni-foam-AT 1 min, Ni-foam-AT
1 min/electroplate 1 min, Ni-foam-AT 1 min/electroplate 2 min, Ni-foam-AT
1 min/electroplate 4 min, Ni-foam-AT 1 min/electroplate 5 min, Ni-foam-AT
1 min/electroplate 5 min-electrooxidation, and IrO2/Ni-foam
are 231.3, 233.3, 104.0, 112.2, 113.0, 112.1, and 194.1 mV dec–1, respectively. The electrodes were scanned at 1 mV
s–1 from negative to positive potential on the RHE
scale to measure the catalytic activity of HER. Performances of Ni-foam
after AT were similar to those of pristine Ni-foam (Figure 4e). Performances of NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructures were high for OER and common for HER in basic solutions.
Therefore, NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures were not exceptional bifunctional
catalysts. Overall water splitting in a two-electrode configuration
was investigated to estimate the performance in real applications
(Figure 4f). The two-electrode
configuration fabricated by pristine Ni-foam and Pt/Ni-foam electrodes
was applied with a voltage of 1.85 V to achieve a 10 mA cm–2 water-splitting current. The two-electrode configuration fabricated
by NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures and Pt/Ni-foam electrodes was applied
with a voltage of 1.72 V to achieve a 10 mA cm–2 water-splitting current, which showed the same performance as that
fabricated by Pt/Ni-foam and Pt/Ni-foam (1.70 V), as previously reported
in literature.17

The electrochemically
active surface area (ECSA) for Ni-foam and
NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures were estimated from the electrochemical
double-layer capacitance of the catalytic surface. The electrochemical
capacitance was determined by measuring the non-Faradic capacitive
current associated with double-layer charging from the scan-rate dependence
of cyclic voltammograms (as shown in Figure 5a–c). The double-layer charging current
(ic) is equal to the product of the scan
rate, v, and the electrochemical double-layer capacitance, CDL, as given by eq 1 1  Thus, a plot of ic as a function of v yields
a straight line with
a slope equal to CDL (Figure 5d). The values of CDL measured from the scan-rate-dependent cyclic voltammograms
for Ni-foam, electroplate 5 min after Ni-foam-AT 1 min, and NiOOH/FeOOH
heterostructures are 0.82, 2.69, and 2.90 mF, respectively. The ECSA
of a catalyst sample is calculated from the double-layer.

voltammograms for Ni-foam. (b) Cyclic voltammograms
for electroplate 5 min after Ni-foam-AT 1 min. (c) Cyclic voltammograms
for NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures. (d) The capacitive currents with
a scan rate of 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mV s–1 in

NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures; cathode: Ni-foam) recorded at an applied
potential of 2.1 V with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.05 Hz in 1
M NaOH.

Capacitance according to eq 2 2  where Cs is the
specific capacitance of the sample or the capacitance of an atomically
smooth planar surface of the material per unit area under identical
electrolyte conditions. General specific capacitances of Cs = 0.040 mF cm–2 in 1 M NaOH were used.
Thus, the values of ECSA for Ni-foam, electroplate 5 min after Ni-foam-AT
1 min, and NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures are 20.50, 67.25, and 72.50
cm2, respectively. The roughness factor (RF) is calculated
by taking the estimated ECSA and dividing it by the geometric area
of the electrode 1 cm2. Thus, the RF of Ni-foam, Ni-foam-AT
1 min/electroplate 5 min, and NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures are 20.50,
67.25, and 72.50, respectively. The heterostructures contain abundant
interfaces, which synergistically favor the chemisorption of hydrogen
and oxygen-containing intermediates, thus accelerating the water oxidation
activity of NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures. We measured the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy to study the kinetics in two-electrode electrolyzers
(Figure 5e). In the
circuit diagram, Rs originates from the
resistor of two-electrode electrolyzers. Rct comes from the charge-transfer resistance between catalyst and reaction
of water splitting. The electrochemical impedance parameters were
obtained by using Z-View software: Rs =
22.8 Ω cm2, Rct = 4.8
Ω cm2. The small value of Rct indicates that fast electronic exchange occurs between catalyst
and reaction of water splitting. We did not observe diffusion resistance.
The result indicates that the three-dimensional porous electrode is
beneficial to the diffusion of electrolyte (H+ and OH–).

We desiged a modified device to collect and
measure hydrogen and
oxygen according to the device of collecting hydrogen and measuring
gas constant (Figure 6a). The specific experimental principles and steps are given in the Experimental Section. Experimental results of gas
constant demonstrated that the relative error of the value of gas
constant was less than 2% (as shown in Table S4), indicating that the device was accurate in collecting and measuring
gas volume. We integrated the device and an H-model electrolytic bath
to collect and measure hydrogen and oxygen in the two-electrode system,
as shown in Figure 6b. Figure 6c illustrates
that (the anode was NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures, and the cathode
was Ni-foam) the volume ratio of hydrogen-to-oxygen is approximately
2:1. Thus, the double-electrode system presented almost overall water
splitting. Figure 6c also indicates that Faraday efficiency of H2 or O2 was close to 90% when the volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
was 2:1. We also tested the Faraday efficiency of evolved O2 at 10 mA cm–2 (Figure S4). The Faraday efficiency (O2) of approximately 100% is
achieved, which demonstrated that the current density was totally
derived from the OER process and not from other side reaction. The
stability is also important for practical applications. We studied
the stabilities of tested two-electrode electrolyzers (the cathode
is Pt/Ni-foam for hydrogen evolution, the anode is NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures
electric catalyst for oxygen evolution, and the electrolyte is 1 M
NaOH solution, 1.85 V of bias voltage). The result is shown in Figure 6d. We can see that
the current density did not decline significantly during 10 h. Thus,
the stability of the NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures is generally good.
This material features low cost, high activity, and good stability,
making it highly competitive in potential large-scale industrial applications.
This catalyst also proposes a feasible scheme for the current energy
shortage.

Conclusions
Highly active NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as
water oxidation catalysts
were prepared via three-step strategy (surface acid-treating, electroplating,
and electrooxidation). This process is simple, green, and low cost.
NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures as water-oxidation catalysts only require
η of 257 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm–2, which is superior to that of IrO2/Ni-foam (280 mV).
Abundant interfaces in NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures increased the
highly electrochemically active surface area, roughness factor, and
pulled water oxidation activity up. Hydrogen-to-oxygen volume ratios
(approximately 2:1) indicate almost overall water splitting by the
double-electrode system. The robust NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures exhibit
good stability.

for 30 min and immersed in 100 mL 0.02 M NaBH4 alcohol
solution for 10 min. Finally, above foam was dried at 120 °C
for 30 min once again.

above three solutions were mixed and transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave. The Ni-foam was immersed in Teflon-lined autoclave containing
the mixed solution. The Teflon-lined autoclave was heated at 200 °C
for 15 h.

voltage range was 2–0 V for OER; scanning speed was 0.001 V
s–1, with the scan direction from positive to negative.

For dual-electrode LSV test, NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures were
used as anode electrode, Ni-foam as cathode electrode, and 1.0 M NaOH
solution as electrolyte. Test conditions were as follows: voltage
range of 2–1 V and scanning speed of 0.001 V s–1, with the scan direction from positive to negative.

Principle of
Measuring the Gas Constant
The gas constant R = PV/nT on the basis
of the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. Under certain temperature and pressure, we can measure the volume
of the hydrogen produced in the reaction of magnesium (Mg) and dilute
sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The mole of hydrogen
is obtained through the quality of magnesium. The resulting hydrogen
is saturated with water vapor. Therefore, the pressure of hydrogen
can be obtained by the principle of partial pressures ([P(H2) = P – P(H2O)], P is atmospheric pressure). The measurement
process of gas constant is as follows: (1) the experiment device is
shown in the section of Results and Discussion; (2) the gas tightness of the device was checked: when the funnel
was pulled down distance, there was a liquid-level difference between
the rubber tube and eudiometer, which indicate that the gas tightness
of the experimental device was good; (3) 0.025–0.03 g magnesium
strips were attached to the top of the reaction tube. Four milliliter
of 0.2 M sulfuric acid was injected into the reaction tube from the
bottom of the test tube. The position of the rubber tube was adjusted
so that its level was the same as that of eudiometer. (4) After the
reaction stopped, the gas was cooled down to room temperature. The
liquid level of the rubber tube was adjusted to make it equal to that
of eudiometer. The volume of hydrogen was recorded. The experimental
temperature and pressure were measured and recorded.

H2/O2 Collection and Measurement
NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructures
were used as working electrode and pristine
Ni-foam was used as auxiliary electrode. The H-type electrolyzer is
connected to the collection device. The i–t test was then performed on the above two electrodes (applying
2.1 V for 400 000 s). The volume of O2 was recorded
when the volume of H2 was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 mL.
