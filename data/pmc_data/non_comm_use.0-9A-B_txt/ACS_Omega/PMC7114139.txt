Over
2.7 billion liters of pot ale is produced annually as a co-product
of Scottish malt whisky, and apart from evaporation to pot ale syrup
as a feed, it is primarily treated by anaerobic digestion or land/sea
disposal. The aim of this study was to assess pot ale components and
their potential applications. The insoluble solid fraction, mainly
consisting of yeast, contained 55% protein, and as a protein feed
ingredient, this could yield 32,400 tons of feed per annum, although
the Cu content of this fraction would need to be monitored. The liquid
fraction could yield 33,900 tons of protein per annum, and an SDS-PAGE
profile of this fraction demonstrated that the proteins may be similar
to those found in beer, which could extend their application as a
food ingredient. This fraction also contained phosphorus, potassium,
and polyphenols among other components, which could have added value.
Overall, fractionation of pot ale could offer an alternative to evaporation
to pot ale syrup while retaining the protein fraction in the food
chain.

Introduction
Scotland is famous for its malt whisky,
and production is protected by the Scotch Whisky Regulations (2009)1 with malted barley, water, and yeast being the
sole ingredients. Production is closely linked to a comprehensive
environmental policy with the Scotch Whisky Association’s environmental
strategy, updated in 2016, setting ambitious targets governing energy,
water, and packaging sustainability.2 Integral
to this is the generation and use of co-products. The main co-products
from malt whisky are draff, the residual starch-depleted grains remaining
after the mashing step, pot ale, the liquid residue from the first
distillation step, and spent lees from subsequent distillations. An
overview of the malt whisky production process including generation
of co-products is illustrated in Figure 1. For every 1 L of alcohol produced, approximately
2.5 kg of draff, 8 L of pot ale, and 10 L of spent lees (and washings)
were the resulting yield.3 Scottish distilleries
have the capacity to produce over 400 million liters of alcohol per
annum,4 which would yield almost 850,000
tons of draff, 2,720,000 tons of pot ale, and 3,400,000 tons of spent
lees, assuming 85% production capacity as based on a 10 year average
to 2017.5

Figure 1 Malt whisky production and co-product
generation. Co-products marketed as feeds are highlighted in bold.

The applications and disposal route for whisky
co-products are diverse. Spent lees, a dilute solution of organic
acids and alcohols with a low pH and biological oxygen demand (BOD)
of 1500 mg/L,6 is generally treated by
a conventional biological effluent treatment. It has significant levels
of Cu in the range of 15–25 mg/L,7 and novel methods for Cu removal such as electrocoagulation or use
of spent grain as an adsorbent have been suggested.7,8 Draff
can be used directly as a feed or dried with pot ale syrup to form
distillers dark grains, both of which are primarily used as cattle
or sheep feed.9 Distilleries have also
invested in combined heat and power plants with pressed draff co-combusted
with wood. An example of this is the Rothes CoRDe facility in Speyside,
which processes co-products from a number of surrounding distilleries
and operates a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) process
with an annual input of 130,000 tons of wet draff and 40,000 tons
of wood chips.10

Pot ale consists
of yeast, yeast and barley residues, soluble protein and carbohydrate,
and variable copper levels, and there is no single preferred application.
As a feed, pot ale was traditionally fed to pigs with the earliest
distilleries closely linked with agriculture6 and can be concentrated by evaporation to pot ale syrup, a nutrient-rich
and palatable ruminant feed, listed under number 1.12.16 in the EU
catalogue of feed materials.11 Pot ale
syrup is typically 42% dry matter, 13.4% protein, and 41 mg/kg copper,
according to commercial datasheet for pot ale syrup from Scottish
malt whisky distilleries.12 The high copper
content restricts its use in sheep, and the difficulties associated
with handling and storing the highly viscous syrup means that it is
not always an attractive option for farmers. Pot ale syrup currently
sells at ∼£60/ton, and coupled with the high-energy demands
in evaporation, it has a low return for distilleries (personal communication
from distillers and feed merchants). There are 10 facilities now licensed
for pot ale syrup feed production, according to the Agricultural Industries
Confederation (AIC) trade insurance scheme checker, the official certification
scheme for operating feed production facilities in the United Kingdom.13 This includes Tomintoul, Ardmore, Aberlour,
Dalmunach, Glenlivet, Blair Athol, Dufftown, and Aberfeldy distilleries
along with pot ale syrup production at the Glenlossie Dark Grains
Plant, which processes pot ale from a number of Diageo-owned distilleries
and Rothes CoRDe Ltd.

The other main uses of pot ale are consented
land and sea disposal and treatment in anaerobic digestion (AD). Land
spreading is at a cost to the distillery with a paid-for third party
disposal. Consented discharge to the sea is permitted in certain circumstances,
but this is only an option for coastal distilleries where specific
discharge licenses are granted. For example, on Islay, an island off
the west coast of Scotland with eight distilleries, pot ale from a
number of the distilleries is discharged via Caol Ila distillery,
which is located on the shore of the Sound of Isla. There are currently
eight AD plants that the authors know of that are located at Scottish
malt whisky distilleries, at Bruichladdich, Balmenach, Dailuiane,
Glendullan, Roseisle, Glenmorangie, Alisa Bay and Glenfiddich distilleries,
with two further distilleries (Dalmore and Tamnavulin) planning to
send their pot ale to a new AD plant at the Invergordon grain distillery.
With a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and BOD, reported in the
regions of 47 and 25 g/L, respectively,14 energy generation by anaerobic digestion is an attractive option.
However, the drive toward energy generation, with CHP for draff and
anaerobic digestion for pot ale, has met with resistance from Scottish
farmers, with whisky co-products making an important contribution
to local farming and economy.9 However,
the two options are not necessarily incompatible with protein extraction
from pot ale having a positive effect on the AD startup.15

The number of malt whisky distilleries
in Scotland and capacity of existing distilleries are expanding with
an increase from 234 to 362 MLPA between 2007 and 2017.5 This has led to increased volumes of pot ale
and the drive for alternatives to current end routes. The first step
in identifying new feed production methods is understanding the composition
of pot ale, particularly with regards to the distribution of components
between the solid and liquid fractions. There is a lack of consistent
data on pot ale composition, and the main information is elucidated
from commercial particulars of pot ale syrup products or studies on
anaerobic digestion of pot ale. In the latter case, the focus is mainly
on water quality parameters from a wastewater treatment point of view.
The variation in BOD, COD, pH, volatile acids, and Cu in a distillery14 and impact of solid–liquid separation
and pH adjustment on COD, phosphorus, ammonia, Cu, Ca, and Mg removal16,17 have been reported. However, the nutritional benefits are often
overlooked, and further insight into this would expand the feed application
options of this protein-rich co-product. The continued application
of distillery co-products in feed is also important in satisfying
the increasing demand for protein for animal and fish feeds. For 2017/2018,
the European Union reported that 85 million tons of protein was used
as feed of which 15% was sourced from soya bean meals.18 Soya bean meal is mainly imported with only
2% self-sufficiency on a protein basis, corresponding to annual imports
of over 12.7 million tons of protein originating from soya bean meal.
Similarly, the United Kingdom used 102,000 tons of soya cake and meal
in animal feed in 2017.19 The continued
use of pot ale in feed has the potential to provide nearly 36,000
tons of protein (estimated based on 33% protein on a dry matter basis
and 2.7 million tons of pot ale with 4% dry matter produced per annum).
In this study, the pot ale from a single distillery was assessed in
terms of nutritive parameters and the implications for use in animal
feed are discussed. Pot ale has two distinct fractions—an insoluble
solid fraction, which mainly consists of yeast, and a fraction containing
soluble carbohydrate and protein. The main aims of this study were
to compare the distribution of components between the solid and liquid
phases and to examine the protein fraction in more detail with particular
focus on extending feed applications beyond the pot ale syrup for
cattle and pigs.

Results and Discussion
Pot Ale Composition and
Distribution of Components between Yeast and Supernatant Fractions
Pot ale appeared as a brownish liquid and had two distinct layers
with an insoluble solid, yeast fraction forming at the bottom of containers
with settling as per previous descriptions (Table 122). The pH varied
between 3.6 and 4.1, which is in line with a previous report where
pH varied between 3.3 and 4.1 and was attributed to the concentration
of volatile acids.14 The yeast content
was approximately 2.9 × 108 cells/ml, and the total
dry matter was 5.1% (Table 1). The concentration of yeast cells is as expected with pitching
at 3–4 × 107 cells/ml, typically leading to
approximately 2 × 108 cells/ml in the washback at
the end of the fermentation,23 and this
yeast would be concentrated up to 2-fold in the wash still. The dry
matter content is typically between 4 and 4.5%,6 although the yeast settles out quite quickly, so batch
variation would be expected depending on sampling procedures. The
insoluble dry matter is not solely due to yeast concentration with
other insoluble components such as grain particles and bacterial cells
mainly from lactobacilli being present, in addition to precipitated
protein.

Table 1 Characterization of Pot Ale from a Malt
Whisky Distillerya
a The image on the
left is pot ale in a collection container after the yeast and other
insoluble solids have settled out. A mean of six independent samples
are shown with SEM in brackets.

The crude protein content of pot ale varied between 14.6 and 20
g/L with a mean of 33% on a dry matter basis (Figure 2). This is similar to a commercially available
pot ale syrup where the protein content of the Spey syrup from the
AB Agri group is quoted between 30 and 35%.12 The distribution of dry matter and protein between the insoluble
solids (pellet) and soluble (supernatant) fraction of pot ale is shown
in Figure 2. The total
dry matter varied between 47 and 58 g/L with 35–43 g/L soluble
solids in the supernatant and 8–18 g/L as insoluble solids
in the pellet fraction. The majority of the protein was in the supernatant
fraction compared to the pellet (9.7–11.7 g protein/L compared
to 4.5–9.2 g/L), although this was reflected by the variation
in total dry matter. If these fractions were separated and dried separately,
then this would yield products with 28 and 55% protein in the supernatant
and yeast fractions, respectively. Separation of the yeast from a
similar co-product stream from wheat bioethanol production has been
suggested,24 and the potential of malt
distillers yeast as a feed ingredient is explored in the following
section.

Figure 2 (a) Dry matter and (b) the crude protein content of pot ale samples
(1–6) collected at different times from a malt whisky distillery
and distribution between yeast solid (pellet) and soluble supernatant
fractions. The mean of three determinations with SEM for the total
sample are shown.

There is little information on
the amino acid composition of pot ale and the contribution of yeast
and soluble protein. For the commercial pot ale syrup, data for lysine,
methionine, histidine, cysteine, and threonine is available with feeding
recommended for cows, horses, and pigs but not sheep due to the copper
content.12 For the pot ale samples analyzed
here, lysine, and threonine were present in lower concentrations (4.1
and 3.1 compared to 6.5 and 5.6% crude protein, respectively), while
histidine and methionine were present at a concentration similar to
the pot ale syrup (3.5 compared to 3.2% and 0.9 compared to 1.1%)
(Table 2). Cysteine
was not analyzed in this study. The concentration and variability
in amino acid components has implications for use in feed with animals
and fish feed having specific minimal requirements for essential amino
acids depending on age and species.25,26 For nonruminants,
of the 22 amino acids, 12 are synthesized by the animal; the other
10 (arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) must be provided
in the diet for normal growth. The amino acid requirements of animals
and fish is specific to species and stage of growth. A comparison
of the amino acid profile of pot ale with requirements for Atlantic
salmon and pigs is provided in Table 2. Inclusion of all animals and stages of growth are
outside the scope of this report, and selected data for grower category
of Atlantic salmon26 and mean data for
pigs between 5 and 100 kg are provided.27 From Table 2, it
is clear that most of the amino acids in the pot ale are present at
less than the minimal concentration of requirements for Atlantic salmon
and pigs. Arginine, methionine, and phenylalanine was less than required
for both salmon and pigs, while isoleucine, leucine, lysine, and threonine
were also below the minimal requirement for pigs. This would have
implications for marketing the protein in pot ale as a complete animal
or fish feed; however, as it only comprises a fraction of the total
diet, other amino acids can be supplemented with other feeds, although
this would impact on the economic value of pot ale as a feed ingredient.

The
concentration of minerals in pot ale has implications for its use
either in feed or for disposal. For the macroelements, minimum feed
requirements are often identified but upper levels are not necessarily
set, whereas for trace elements, maximum allowable concentrations
are controlled by regulations such as EC no. 1334/2003.28 The recommended levels of macroelements depend
on species, stage of growth, and level of other dietary minerals.
In terms of disposal, discharge of particular elements in to waterways
or on land is governed by environmental regulations. Also, particular
minerals can impact on process equipment; for example, calcium oxalate,
calcium phosphate, and magnesium salts cause fouling of evaporators
used for pot ale syrup production.29 Here,
Ca, Mg, K, Na, and P were measured at mean values of 1.3, 6.2, 23.1,
0.7, and 13.4 g/kg dry matter, respectively, and the microelements
at 101.4, 37.0, 13.6, and 24.6 mg/kg dry matter for Cu, Fe, Mn, and
Zn, respectively (Table 2).

The concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Na were within the same
range as that reported for Spey syrup (Table 2). However, P and K were 5 and 10 times that
of Spey syrup with averages of 13.4 and 23.1 g/kg for P and K, respectively.
Concentrations reported here are more in line with that of thin stillage
(or distillers solubles) from corn bioethanol plants with 12.9 g/kg
P and 17.6 g/kg K reported.30 The total
P is similar to that previously reported for pot ale (0.7 g/L total
P with 0.5 g/L as free P in the soluble fraction).16 The high P concentration is of particular concern, with
excess P in the diet being excreted with subsequent pollution issues
and accumulation in the environment, and there is also the wider question
of P sustainability with future shortages as highlighted by the European
sustainable phosphorus platform.31 For
example, fish farming impacts phosphorus dynamics in lake sediments,32 one of the research areas of the European sustainable
phosphorus platform is inefficient P cycling, and the environmental
challenges of excess P in manure and potential to recover P from sewage
or manure are well recognized.33

If new feed applications for pot ale are to be developed, then it
is important to identify whether any process can be used to reduce
the concentration of deleterious minerals in the final feed and to
assess whether these elements are concentrated in the solid or liquid
fractions. The distribution of Ca, K, Mg, Na, and free and total P
between insoluble yeast and soluble, supernatant pot ale fractions
were compared (Figure 3). There was very little variation in the P content between three
distillery samples, and over 90% of it was associated with the supernatant
fraction (Figure 3).
This has implications for the use of this supernatant fraction as
a feed component as, on a dry weight basis, the total P is 16.3 g/kg
with 13.1 g/kg as free P. This makes the yeast fraction more attractive
for feed applications. For the supernatant fraction, a process to
reduce the P content may be required to extend feed applications and
also to recover P as a potential product. Extraction of P from the
supernatant has been demonstrated with a process using pH balancing
to separate the Ca, P, N, and Mg as a solid precipitate with potential
use as fertilizer16,17 and may offer an alternative
to pot ale feed applications.

Figure 3 (a) Ca, (b) Na, (c) M, (d) K, (e) total, and
(f) free P of pot ale samples (1–3) collected at different
times from a malt whisky distillery and distribution between yeast
solid (pellet) and soluble supernatant fractions. The mean of three
determinations with SEM for the total sample are shown. The total
and supernatant fractions were analyzed with the pellet fraction estimated
by difference.

Calcium, at 0.07 g/L, is similar
to that of pot ale syrup, which has 1.5 g/kg on a dry matter basis
corresponding to 0.06 g/L, assuming pot ale with 4.2% dry matter for
the commercially available Spey syrup. This is sufficient for pigs,
while for fish, Ca is often absorbed directly from the environment
and minimum feed levels are not set.34 However,
the high P compared to Ca may cause a Ca:P ratio imbalance in pot
ale for feed applications, although most research is focused on the
impact of high Ca on P bioavailability.35

Potassium was much higher at 1.19 g/L compared to 0.09 g/L
quoted for pot ale syrup. Over 80% of this K was associated with the
supernatant fraction, with 26 g/kg on a dry matter basis for this
fraction. High levels of K have been implicated in negative impacts
of increasing concentrations of corn steep liquor in liquid diets
fed to pigs.36 In this case, K would be
an issue for the supernatant fraction if used as a feed and would
be expected to face the same issues as the corn steep liquor, which
can be regarded as a similar by-product stream from corn-based distillery
processes.

In terms of trace elements, Cu is the most problematic
in the use of pot ale syrup in animal feed. The maximum permitted
levels of trace elements in feeds is controlled by EC regulation 2831/2003
on feed additives with the maximum content of Cu, as mg/kg of complete
feedingstuff (with 88% dry matter) listed in regulation EC no. 1334/2003
and amended in 2112/2003.28,37 Maximum Cu levels in
complete feedingstuff for pigs is 25 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg for bovine (15
mg/kg before the start of rumination), 15 mg/kg for ovine, 50 mg/kg
for crustaceans, and 25 mg/kg for fish and other species. In the pot
ale tested here, the Cu content was quite variable, 1.7–15.3
mg/L, corresponding to an average of 101 mg/kg pot ale. This is similar
to previous reports where the Cu content of pot ale varied between
2 and 6 mg/L over an 8 week period.14 Cu
in pot ale originates from the distinctive pot still, which is composed
of copper and has an essential role to play in whisky aroma.38 The Cu content in feed is controlled particularly
for sheep where feeds must include the following label when copper
exceeds 10 mg/kg: “the level of copper in this feedingstuff
may cause poisoning in certain breeds of sheep”.28 The copper level in pot ale on a dry matter
basis exceeds the maximum allowable level for all animals if used
as a complete feedingstuff, and the variability in the content is
of concern when predicting how much to mix with rations. With this
in mind, separation processes that can reduce the Cu content of the
feed fraction would be particularly desirable. Cu was predominantly
associated with the yeast fraction. With approximately 80% of the
Cu, this fraction contained 410 mg/kg, whereas the supernatant fraction
contained 20 mg/kg on a dry matter basis. In all cases, the content
in the yeast fraction was higher than recommended feed levels, and
this would impact on the proportion of yeast that could be incorporated
into feed. Separation of the yeast fraction automatically removes
Cu from the supernatant fraction, and this may open up new applications
for the use of the supernatant fraction. Binding of Cu to the yeast
cell wall is expected with the action of yeast as a metal biosorbent
being well known.39

The concentrations
of Fe and Mn were less than the maximum allowable levels in feed according
to EU regulations.28,37 Fe ranged from 0.6 to 3.9 mg/L
(11–83 mg/kg on a dry matter basis) and was mainly associated
with the yeast fraction with an average of 81% located in this phase.
The concentration of Fe in pot ale was well below the maximum allowable
level for feed, which ranges from the lowest level of 500 mg/kg for
ovine to the highest level of 1250 mg/kg for pet animals.37 Mn ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 mg/L (7.7–21.6
mg/kg on a dry matter basis) in the total pot ale, which is less than
the maximum allowable level of 100 mg/kg for fish and 150 mg/kg for
other species.

The EU has recently reduced Zn levels in feeds
for farmed animals (EU regulation no. 2016/1095) due to concerns about
elevated Zn in drainage systems and surface water.40 This regulation sets the upper limit for a complete feed
at 180 mg of Zn per kg of complete feed for salmonids and calf milk
replacers; 150 mg/kg for piglets, sows, rabbits, and other fish; and
120 mg/kg for other species and classes of animals. On a dry matter
basis, the Zn content ranged from 15.7 to 35.6 mg/kg in the pot ale,
which is less than the maximum allowable levels. For the supernatant
fraction, the Zn concentration was less than the regulated levels
with an average value of 18.2 mg/kg. The Zn content of the yeast fraction
was higher and ranged from 18.0 to 108.8 mg/kg, although this is still
less than the maximum allowable level.

One of the main issues
with the use of distillation residues for feed is the inherent variation
in the composition.41 One way to enhance
the quality and composition of pot ale-based feed products would be
to separate the feed-valuable components. Separation of the yeast
would address the variability in yeast concentration and the greater
value, and expanded applications may result from using individual
ingredients rather than concentrating all the components as seen with
products such as pot ale syrup. Separation of yeast as a product from
bioethanol distilleries has been suggested with the yeast tested as
a feed ingredient for nonruminants.24,42,43 However, such processes will only truly be economically
viable and sustainable if all fractions are valorized and have an
end route. From the data in Figures 2 to 4, the composition of insoluble
solid and liquid fractions from pot ale was calculated and potential
applications assessed.

Figure 4 (a) Cu, (b) Fe, (c) Mn, and (d) Zn content of pot ale
samples (1–6) collected at different times from a malt whisky
distillery and distribution between yeast solid (pellet) and soluble
supernatant fractions. The mean of three determinations with SEM for
the total sample is shown. The total and supernatant fractions were
analyzed with the pellet fraction estimated by difference.

Characterization of the Insoluble Solids and Supernatant Fractions
and Potential Applications
On average, 1.2% of pot ale was
insoluble solids on a weight volume basis. This fraction mainly consists
of yeast and yeast debris and also contains some lactobacilli and
cereal residues, including proteins precipitated during distillation.
The yeast fraction contained 55% protein on a dry matter basis. Based
on Scottish malt whisky distilleries having the capacity to produce
2.7 million tons of pot ale per annum, this would yield 32,400 tons
of dried yeast (corresponding to 17,820 tons of protein) per annum.
Scottish malt whisky distilleries do not currently separate the yeast
fraction from pot ale for utilization as a feed ingredient. There
is the potential to separate this fraction as a slurry and use as
is, for example, as a pig feed as per brewer’s yeast44 or dried and used as a component in other feeds.

To assess the value of pot ale yeast, the amino acid profile of
the pellet fraction was analyzed and additional composition was estimated
based on the data in Figures 2 to 4 and Table 1, and compared to that of dried brewer’s
yeast, a yeast protein concentrate from a wheat-based bioethanol plant
and a single-cell protein product, Feedkind, from Calysta, Inc. (Table 3). For pot ale yeast
amino acid analysis, two batches were analyzed. Overall, the pot ale
yeast had a similar profile to the brewer’s yeast. Surprisingly,
it had a lower protein concentration compared to the bioethanol yeast
(55% compared to 67.6%, respectively), although this may be related
to the fact that, in this report, the pellet fraction was washed with
water before analysis and would have only reflected the protein in
the yeast and other centrifuged solids in pot ale. The concentration
of essential amino acids in pot ale yeast, apart from methionine,
was in excess of that required for salmon and pig feed, as indicated
in Table 1. In particular,
lysine concentration, which is regarded as one of the limiting amino
acids in plant-based proteins, was present at similar concentrations
to the brewer’s dried yeast and soya bean meal at 6.4% and
well in excess of lysine concentration of YPC and bacterial protein
meal. Cu was concentrated in the pot ale yeast fraction with 107–340
mg/kg, which is over 10 times that allowed in animal feed, including
fish.28 Based on this, inclusion of pot
ale yeast in feeds would be restricted to a maximum of 10% of the
feed ration. The Zn content of the pot ale yeast varied between 18
and 109 mg/kg. A higher Zn content may be attractive for feed applications
with the use of Zn supplementation in EU feeds by addition of salts
such as zinc oxide being recently restricted. In this case, being
able to add a feed ingredient with an elevated Zn content, which is
still below the recommended levels, would be attractive. Supplementation
of pig diets with zinc and copper has been suggested as an alternative
to antibiotics.45 Similarly, copper supplementation
also plays an important role in egg-laying hens and may contribute
to lower egg yolk cholesterol.46 It may
be that the pot ale yeast could have additional benefits, although
the bioavailability of the mineral components would need to be confirmed.

One issue
with the use of yeast as a feed product is the variation in amino
acid profile with components varying with strains, growth conditions,
and additional process steps. It would be expected that the pot ale
yeast would be suitable as a feed ingredient similar to brewer’s
yeast, which is used for pigs, ruminant, poultry, and fish.44 However, there are a number of inherent differences
that may be advantageous to the use of the distillery yeast. Scottish
malt whisky distilleries typically use four types of Saccharomyces cerevisae—distillers M and MX
yeast, Pinnacle Yeast, and DistilaMax yeast.47 In contrast to breweries where different yeast strains may be used
depending on beer style, a distillery will tend to utilize the same
yeast strain and propagation strategy, so variation within a distillery
would be reduced. Also, compared to brewer’s yeast, the pot
ale yeast would not have the bittering effect, originating from hops,
which causes issues with palatability.48 Another difference is that brewer’s yeast is still viable
and needs to be inactivated, either by heating or acid treatment,
whereas distiller’s yeast is already inactivated after distillation.
However, the effect of distillation on yeast integrity and quality
is unknown, although based on the research on bioethanol yeast,24,42 there is the potential to use yeast from pot ale from malt whisky
as feed ingredients.

If yeast is separated from pot ale as a
feed ingredient, then new end routes for the resulting supernatant
fraction also need to be realized. On average, 3.8% of the pot ale
was solids in the supernatant fraction and it contained 28% protein
on a dry matter basis. For the pot ale supernatant analyzed here,
it had particularly high concentrations of Mg (6.6 g/kg), P (16.2
g/kg), and K (25.5 g/kg). With high COD (values between 46 and 54
g for centrifuged pot ale from different distilleries),15 it is suitable for anaerobic digestion, although
the high phosphorus concentration in particular can be problematic,
remaining in the treated water after digestion and requiring an additional
treatment step.49 The insoluble yeast fraction
is often seen as deleterious to anaerobic digestion, with yeast settling
out at the bottom of reactors,22 and enzymatic
pretreatment is suggested for lysing cells to improve AD.50 Separation of the yeast fraction as a feed ingredient
may therefore improve anaerobic digestion or even open up new application
routes for the soluble pot ale fraction.

As discussed previously,
the elevated P and K levels may impede the application of this fraction
as a feed ingredient. In addition, the majority of the supernatant
fraction is carbohydrates and it can be assumed that it is a complex
mixture of nonfermentative dextrins remaining after yeast fermentation
in addition to solubilized fiber components (originating from cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin), organic acids such as acetic and lactic
acid, polyphenols, and glycerol. For the pot ale assessed in this
report, the carbohydrate fraction was not characterized. However,
this fraction would be deleterious for new feed applications such
as the use in aquaculture, with carbohydrate levels minimized for
salmon feed in particular with a maximum level of 10–12% carbohydrate
and 2–3% max fiber.26 The use of
the supernatant fraction as a fermentation medium for ethanol production
by Kluyveromyces marxianus has been
suggested, although without prior concentration or addition of other
components, yields are low, impacting on the potential to commercialize
such a process.51,52

Additional value may be
added by separating individual components. For example, research has
focused on a pot ale supernatant as a source of polyphenols as assessed
under the EU-sponsored project “Process for Upgrade and recovery
of polyphenol extracts”(PUReOPE) and also on separation of
the nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium as fertilizer with evaporation
of the remaining fraction to produce a concentrate for anaerobic digestion.17 In addition, the protein component of this fraction
may also be of value. The pot ale supernatant contains approximately
33% protein on a dry matter basis, and based on 2.7 million tons of
pot ale per annum of which 3.8% is the supernatant fraction, this
would indicate that this fraction from malt whisky distilleries in
Scotland could yield approximately 34,000 tons of protein per annum.
The authors have developed a process to separate this protein from
pot ale,53 and if linked with other valorization
steps, then it could be applied as a biorefinery process for whisky
co-products. In addition, there is considered to be an urgent need
for diverse sources of protein as a raw material for bioplastic production54 to further reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based
materials.

In addition to the application of protein from the
supernatant fraction as a protein feed ingredient, it may also be
assumed that the proteins are similar to those present in beer, which
are involved in foam formation and stability55 and therefore may have interesting characteristics. The soluble
proteins in pot ale were assessed by SDS-PAGE with pot ale either
analyzed directly or after concentration using 3 or 10 K NMWL tubes
(Figure 5). For the
direct pot ale sample, a band at 12–14 kDa was apparent. This
band was also present in retentate samples with an additional band
at 38–42 kDa visible for all dilutions. The two bands are within
the size range of LTP1 and protein Z as reported for beer samples.56 It should be highlighted, however, that the
molecular weights reported here are only approximations as a prestained
protein marker was used. In addition to these two bands, two other
protein bands were also visible at the higher protein loading levels;
one at 72–80 kDa and the other with a molecular weight higher
than the largest Mw marker (175 kDa) were
visible at higher protein loading (lanes 2 and 7). Proteins with a Mw higher than protein Z have not been routinely
reported in beer. This is mainly due to the fact that large proteins
are often precipitated and removed during wort preparation. It is
also possible that these are of yeast origin and may correspond to
one of the proteins detected in malt beer.57 It is difficult to conclude whether hordein-derived bands, as reported
for beer between 15 and 32 kDa,56 are absent
in pot ale. The high concentration of the low Mw protein resulted in quite a dark-stained broad band on the
gel, and this may have masked other proteins. It may be that the additional
value can be exploited from pot ale proteins if individual proteins
such as LTP1 and protein Z can be separated and tested for potential
application as functional proteins in food or feed.

Figure 5 SDS-PAGE of pot ale proteins
separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel. Samples were either
run directly without treatment (lanes 1 and 6) or after concentration
using either 3 (lanes 2, 3, and 4) or 10 K (lanes 7, 8, 9, and 10)
nominal molecular weight tubes. The protein concentration (μl)
in each sample is shown, and a broad range prestained molecular weight
ladder was in lane 5. The arrows indicate the main bands that were
visible on the gel.

Overall, there are a
number of components in pot ale that can be valorized. Overall, approximately
2.7 million tons of pot ale is produced per annum by the malt whisky
industry in Scotland. If the insoluble solids and supernatant fractions
are separated, then this has the potential to yield 32,400 tons of
dry yeast containing 17,820 tons of protein as a product stream. If
protein is recovered from the supernatant fraction (102,600 tons of
total dry matter), then 33,858 tons of protein could be obtained for
food or feed, while minerals such as 2616 tons of K, 1662 tons of
P, and 677 tons of Mg can also be reutilized and the remaining stream
is concentrated or used as is in biological processes. Any system
developed for pot ale valorization may also be applicable to other
similar co-product streams. In particular, they may be applied to
liquid fraction from other whiskey distilleries and grain bioethanol
plants where thin stillage/solubles is one of the main products and
typically concentrated by evaporation and added to spent grains to
form dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). With approximately
40% of the energy use of a bioethanol plant used in producing DDGS,58 processes that reduce the energy requirements
of DDGS production or add value to the co-products are required to
ensure the continued sustainability of co-product markets.3

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Storage
Pot ale was collected from a Scottish lowland malt whisky distillery
on six different occasions over a 3 year period (2012–2015).
In Scotland, two-row Spring malting barley is the only cereal used
for malt whisky production, and in this case, the pot ale samples
would have been sourced from three different harvests. Samples were
refrigerated and analyzed within 1 week or stored at −20 °C.
For analysis, either the total sample was analyzed or it was separated
into a supernatant and pellet fractions by centrifuging at 4000 rpm
for 5 min (Heraeus Multifuge 3SR). For nitrogen and amino acid analyses,
samples were freeze-dried and stored in a dessicator. Both total aliquots
and centrifuged solids were freeze-dried (Edwards Super Modulyo Freeze
Dryer) to less than 15% moisture. It was not possible to freeze dry
the supernatant fractions as these remained quite viscous and syrup-like,
and in this case, where freeze drying was required for analysis, only
the total and centrifuged solids were analyzed and the supernatant
composition was determined as the difference between these two samples.
In all cases, results were reported as a mean of three independent
analyses unless otherwise stated.

Dry Matter, pH, and Yeast
Content
The dry matter content (total solids) of pot ale
samples was determined by drying preweighed samples in an oven at
105 °C for 24 h and expressing the dry weight on a % (w/w) basis.
The solid content of the centrifuged solids and supernatant was also
determined and expressed as % (w/w) of the original pot ale. Where
the concentration refers to % (w/w) of the individual fraction, that
is, solids or supernatant fraction, this is specified. The concentration
of intact yeast cells in pot ale was determined by direct counting
using a hemocytometer following suitable dilution in water. In all
samples, rod-shaped bacteria in long chains, assumed to be lactobacilli,
were visible, but these were not quantified. The pH was analyzed directly
using a pH meter (Hanna Instruments, pH 201 microprocessor pH meter).

Micro- and Macroelement Characterization
Flame atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS) (PerkinElmer AAnalyst 200) was used to determine
the concentration of Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn. Total pot
ale samples were digested with nitric acid, whereas supernatants were
acidified with 200 μL of 69% nitric acid added to 10 mL of samples
prior to analysis. For nitric acid digestion, 0.4 mL of 69% HNO3 was added to 0.6 mL of pot ale in a boiling tube and heated
on a heating block at 105 °C for 1 h. After cooling, 6 mL of
distilled deionized water was added. Samples that were diluted with
water were required. For Ca and Mg analysis, La was added to 1% (from
a 50 g/L La stock solution prepared using La2O3) and Cs was added to 0.1% (from a 10 g/L Cs stock solution prepared
using CsCl) for K and Na analysis. Metal concentrations were determined
with reference to the corresponding standards, prepared by diluting
commercial AAS standard stock solutions available from Sigma-Aldrich
(1000 ppm in all cases apart from 10 g/L Na; TraceCERT AAS, Sigma-Aldrich
Co. LLC., Dorset, England). The metal concentrations of the pellet
fraction were calculated as the difference between the supernatant
and total fractions.

Phosphorus (Total and Available) Analysis
Free and total phosphorus were analyzed using the Megazyme phytic
acid (Phytate)/Total phosphorus kit (K-PHYT, Megazyme, Co. Wicklow,
Ireland). The total phosphorus was measured as phosphorus released
by phytase and alkaline phosphatase with free phosphorus determined
before enzyme treatment. Total and supernatant fractions of pot ale
were analyzed, according to the instructions provided with the kit
with pellet determined by difference. Samples were extracted prior
to analysis by mixing 10 mL of total pot ale or supernatant samples
with 33 mL of 1 M HCl and 7 mL of distilled deionized water in a 100
mL duran bottle and incubating on a shaker overnight. After extraction,
1 mL of the extract was added to a 1.5 mL of a microcentrifuge tube
and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 0.5 mL of the supernatant
was added to a microcentrifuge tube and neutralized by addition of
0.5 mL of 0.75 M NaOH. The enzymatic dephosphorylation reaction was
followed as per the Megazyme standard assay procedure according to
the instructions and reagents provided with the kit. Subsequently,
the phosphorus content of free and total samples were analyzed using
the colorimetric method outlined in the kit with reference to a phosphorus
calibration curve prepared at the same time.

Protein and Amino Acid
Analysis
Crude protein of freeze-dried samples (total and
pellet, with supernatant determined by difference) was determined
by combustion using an Exeter CE-440 elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical
UK Ltd., Coventry, UK). Crude protein was calculated as N × 6.25.

Total amino acid analysis of freeze-dried samples (total and pellet,
with supernatant determined by difference) was conducted by acid hydrolysis
followed by ion exchange chromatography with ninhydrin detection and
was conducted by AltaBioscience Ltd., Redditch, UK. For this method,
asparagine and glutamine are converted to aspartic and glutamic acid,
and tryptophan and cysteine need to be determined separately as they
are destroyed during the acid hydrolysis step. The content of specific
amino acids was reported as the percentage of the crude protein.

SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis
Pot ale from a single batch was
centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min (Heraeus Multifuge 3SR), and the
protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford
Assay.20 The supernatant was either analyzed
directly by SDS-PAGE or concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal
filter tubes (3 and 10 K devices, UFC900308 and UFC901008, Merck Millipore
Ltd. Cork, Ireland) where 15 mL of the supernatant was added to the
filter cup of either 3 or 10 K tubes and centrifuged at 4000g and 4 °C. After 3 h, the volume of retentate (the
fraction retained in the filter cup by the ultrafiltration membrane)
was reduced by over 90%. The concentrated protein sample in the retentate
was further dialyzed by adding 15 mL of water to the filter cup and
centrifuging at 4000g for 3 h at 4 °C. The retentate
was then transferred to an eppendorf tube, the filter cup was washed
with 200 μL of water, and this wash fraction was combined with
the retentate. The protein concentration was determined before diluting
samples with distilled water and analyzing by SDS-PAGE.

For
SDS-PAGE analysis, samples were mixed with equal volumes of the Laemmli
sample buffer (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Dorset UK) heated at 90 °C
for 5 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged prior to loading on to 4–20%
precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN Tris-glycine (TGX)
precast gels, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Herts, UK). Gels were run using
a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN Tetra cell system for mini precast gels with
Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer (10× Tris/glycine/SDS running
buffer, Bio-Rad Laboratories). A prestained, broad range (7−175
KDa) protein marker (P7708 New England Biolabs Ltd. Hertz., UK) were
run with all gels to estimate the protein molecular weight. Electrophoresis
was at 180 V for approximately 40 min and stopped when the dye front
reached the bottom of the gel. After electrophoresis, gels were rinsed
with water and stained overnight with a Colloidal Coomassie Blue stain21 consisting of 5% (w/v) aluminium sulphate hydrate,
10% (v/v) ethanol, 0.02% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, and
8% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. Gels were rinsed and destained (10%
ethanol and 2% phosphoric acid) for 1–2 h and rinsed with water
until the background stain was removed. The SDS-PAGE gels were scanned
with a Bio-Rad GelDoc EZ imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and
images were analyzed using the Bio-Rad’s Image Lab software
program to estimate the molecular weight of protein bands.
