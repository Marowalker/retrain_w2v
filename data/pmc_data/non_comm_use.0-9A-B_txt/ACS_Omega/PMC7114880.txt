We
investigated the structural and electronic/spin configurations
of a film of the Co tetrakis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) porphyrazine (CoTTDPz)
molecule adsorbed on the Au(111) surface by a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM). CoTTDPz has a structure similar to that of the Co phthalocyanine
molecule, but the benzene ring of the isoindole of the phthalocyanine
molecule is replaced by the pentagon moiety of 1,2,5-thiadiazoles
that has an S atom at the apex. We find an ordered molecular lattice
with a threefold symmetry where a nearest-neighbor distance of 1.30
nm was measured, which is significantly smaller than that observed
for the metal Pc molecule. The unit cell of the lattice contains two
molecules that are rotated by 60° relative to each other. With
the configuration achieved by this rotation, the neighboring molecules
can form a stronger interaction through bonding between the S atom
at the apex of one molecule and the N atom of the other (the N atom
that is bridging the thiadiazoles). The strong interaction between
the molecule and the substrate appears in the spin state examined
by the detection of the Kondo resonance, which is formed by the screening
of an isolated spin by the conduction electron. Even though the existence
of the spin was confirmed for the bulk and thick films of this molecule,
no Kondo features are detected for the molecules in the first, second,
and third layers of the films. However, the isolated molecule in the
third layer showed an intriguing combination of the Kondo feature
and an inelastic excitation feature caused by a spin-flip process.

Introduction
Due to the wide applications of organic
molecules to the electronics
devices, the control of the interface between the molecule and the
metal surface attracts attentions.1−4 Especially, the understanding of the film
growth at the initial stage has fundamental importance over the final
properties of the organic devices, which has been studied energetically
in recent decades.5,6 Among such studies, metallo-phthalocyanines
(MPcs) and their derivatives are the most well-studied molecules due
to not only their thermal stability but also tunable electronic properties
and adsorption configurations with the change of the metal atom at
the center. In addition, several double-decker Pc molecules possess
an intriguing property of the single-molecule magnets (SMMs), which
makes them good candidates for advanced quantum computing materials.7−10 Despite such importance, most of the works for the control of molecule–molecule
and molecule–substrate interaction are restricted to the cases
governed by their weak interactions including the van der Waals forces.

In the control of such interactions, the property of the outer
perimeter of the molecule (or the ligand) plays a critical role. In
that sense, the modification of the perimeter of MPc family molecules
might be able to tune the molecular interaction with the surroundings,
while the molecule keeps the intriguing properties of the MPc. Stuzhin
and their co-workers synthesized metallo-tetrakis(1,2,5-thiadiazole)
porphyrazines (MTTDPz),11,12 in which the benzene
ring in the Pc ligand is replaced with the reactive moiety of 1,2,5-thiadiazoles,
which has an S atom at the apex. This S atom interacts with the N
atom of the neighbor molecule, which is bridging the thiadiazoles.13,14 Our previous works on vanadyl tetrakis(thiadiazole) porphyrazine
(VOTTDPz) show that the substituted ligands give a large effect on
the stacking and the magnetic properties.15

In this article, we report a low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscope (LT-STM) study of cobalt TTDPz (CoTTDPz) molecule adsorbed
on the Au(111) surface. The chemical structure of CoTTDPz is shown
in Figure 1a. We performed
STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments to characterize
the bonding configuration and electronic properties of CoTTDPz. In
addition, we examine the spin property of the molecule by detecting
the Kondo resonance near the Fermi level, which is caused by the screening
of the spin of the molecule by the conduction electrons.

Results and Discussion
We start with the description of
the first layer of the CoTTDPz
film on Au(111), which we call as phase I hereafter. We show the topographic
image of the phase I film in Figure 1a,b obtained with the occupied and unoccupied states,
respectively. As can be seen in the inner structure of the molecule
in both images, the molecule shows a symmetric four-lobe shape, indicating
flat-lying adsorption on Au(111). This configuration can also be seen
in the first layer of MPc16−22 and VOTTDPz15 films on Au(111). Herringbone
of Au(111) under phase I can be clearly distinguished in a large-scale
image (not shown here), indicating that molecules do not change the
conventional 22 × √3 reconstruction of Au(111). The molecular
lattice of phase I can be described using the unit cell shown as a
green parallelogram in Figure 1b. The unit cell can be constructed by two vectors a1 and a2. It contains two molecules that are not equivalent because the azimuthal
angles of them are rotated by ∼60° relative to each other.
Thus, we can define “row” of the molecules along which
the molecules have an identical azimuthal rotation angle and the molecules
in the next row are rotated by 60°. The unit cell can be expressed
with the unit vectors a1 and a2, whose lengths are 1.30 and 2.60
nm, respectively, and are rotated by 60° relative to each other.
They are commensurate with Au(111) and can be expressed by unit vectors
of the nonreconstructed Au(111) surface (here called α and β) as follows  

The model is illustrated in Figure 1c.

The lattice shows a significant difference
from the molecular lattice
reported for the film of the MPc molecules formed on Au(111). When
the coverage was close to the monolayer, they often show the quasi-square
lattices that were reported for the CoPc,16,17 VOPc,18,19 FePc,20,21 and H2Pc22 molecules. The pseudo-square unit cell can be
expressed as follows  

The reported nearest-neighbor
distances (nnd) of the Pc molecules
for these cases are close to 5 times of the nnd of the Au(111) surface,
which corresponds to 1.44 nm. Thus, the nnd of 1.30 nm observed for
the CoTTDPz molecule in this experiment is significantly shorter than
those reported for MPc and H2Pc cases.

It is intriguing
to notice that the topographic image shows a large
change when the polarity of the tunneling bias voltage is reversed.
Although the molecule appears as the cross with almost equal heights
at the center and the perimeters in the unoccupied state image of Figure 1b, the central part
of the molecule is much enhanced in the occupied state image in Figure 1a. This phenomenon
is attributed to the shift of Co d state on the surface. The singly
occupied orbital in vacuum becomes fully occupied due to charge transfer
and shows an enhanced signal when occupied states are imaged by negative
bias.23,24,30

The
difference in the adsorption configuration of CoTTDPz from
the MPc molecules can also be found in other features. Figure 1d shows molecules adsorbed
near the step edge. It has been discussed that the molecule adsorbed
at the step edge tends to have a canted bonding configuration; that
is, a part of the molecule is bonded on the upper terrace and the
other is bonded on the lower terrace of a step edge. Zhao and co-workers
showed that, for the CoPc molecule adsorbed on the Au(111) surface,
more than 75% of CoPc molecules at the step edge have one or two lobes
anchoring on the higher terrace.25 However,
for the current system of the CoTTDPz molecule on Au(111), only ∼30%
of the molecules were confirmed to have the tilted configuration (the
raised lobes are marked by red arrows in the figure). We speculate
that a strong lateral thiadiazole–Au bonding is the underlying
mechanism for the suppressed appearance of the tilted configuration.

STS (dI/dV) spectra measured
for the isolated molecule and the molecule in the phase I film are
illustrated in Figure 1e,f, respectively, and we show the spectra obtained both at the center
and the ligand positions in both panels. The condition of the STM
tip was checked by confirming the surface state of the bare part of
the Au(111) surface before taking the molecular spectra, which is
shown by the plot in red.

For the spectrum of the isolated molecule
shown in Figure 1e,
we identify the features
at ∼−0.36 V (blue curve) and ∼−0.54 V
(green curve) together with a common feature at ∼0.13 V. In
addition, a weak feature can be identified at ∼+0.65 V on the
ligand position.

It is interesting to notice that we can find
the corresponding
features in the spectra obtained for an isolated CoPc adsorbed on
Cu(100) if we ignore the shift of the bonding energy.26 However, the STS obtained for the CoPc molecule adsorbed
on Au(111) is much different and has no corresponding features. Moreover,
there appeared a feature near the Fermi level for the former case,26 which is missing for the latter. This feature
is interpreted as the adsorption-induced states (AISs) formed by the
hybridization of the electronic states of the substrate and the molecule.26 It is well known that the Cu(100) substrate
has a stronger bonding with the CoPc molecule than Au(111) does, which
is supposed to be the origin of differences in the STS of the two.

We can find the AIS at 0.13 V in the spectrum of Figure 1e. Combined with the similarity
in the STS features, we consider that the electronic structure of
the CoTTDPz molecule on Au(111) is similar to that of CoPc on Cu(111)
rather than that on Au(111), which is due to the strong bonding of
the CoTTDPz molecule with the Au(111) substrate with the presence
of reactive species of S and N atoms.

The spectra shown in Figure 1f are obtained for
the molecule in the lattice of the phase
I film. The green curve shows a similar shape to the corresponding
one in Figure 1e, but
the peak position is shifted to −0.31 V in (f) from −0.56
V in (e). We also see another new peak at −0.53 V in (f). The
differences are derived from the formation of the molecule–molecule
interactions.

After the completion of the first monolayer, the
second layer was
formed with subsequent deposition of the molecule of the CoTTDPz molecule,
in which two types of adsorption configurations labeled phases IIa and IIb were observed.

We first examine
the bonding configuration of phase IIa. Figure 2a shows
the topographic image of phase IIa of the second layer.
Unlike the symmetric four-lobe feature observed in phase I, a single
lobe out of four lobes is highlighted in an asymmetric manner. This
is illustrated in the magnified image in the inset of Figure 2a, where the enhanced lobes
are marked by blue dots. To demonstrate that this was not caused by
the tip effect, we show the area where both phases I and IIa are visible in Figure 2b. In this image, while four lobes appear with an equivalent contrast
in phase I, one particular lobe possesses a highlighted contrast in
phase IIa.

20 nm2, 0.5 V, 100 pA); b1 and b2 are vectors of
unit cell (green
parallelogram). (Inset) Magnified image of the film where the elevated
lobe is marked by blue dots. (b) Surface areas where phases I and
IIa coexist (14 × 14 nm2, 0.5 V, 100 pA);
highlighted lobes are labeled by blue dots. (c) Comparison of the
unoccupied state image (upper panel, Vs = +0.5 V) and occupied state image (lower panel, Vs = −0.5 V) of phase IIa. Molecule position
is illustrated by a simplified cross, and the center and highlighted
lobe are marked by red and blue dots, respectively. (d) Top view of
the model of IIa; molecules in film I are colored in light-blue.
(e) Model of IIa in a side view. (f) dI/dV on highlighted lobe in IIa (I = 0.1 nA, Vs = 0.5 V, Vrms = 20 mV). (g) dI/dV on the center in IIa (I =
0.1 nA, Vs = 0.5 V, Vrms = 20 mV).

When the polarity of the tunneling bias was reversed, this asymmetric
height distribution among the ligand is enhanced. We show the change
of the topographic image with the reversal of the bias-voltage polarity
in Figure 2c in which
the upper half corresponds to the unoccupied state, while the lower
corresponds to the occupied one. In the occupied state image of phase
I shown in Figure 1a, the central part of the molecule is highlighted. Similarly in
the lower half of Figure 2c, we see that the central parts of the molecules marked by
red dots are bright. However, the bright spot is seen not only at
the center but also at one of the lobes that are marked by blue dots.
By comparing the unoccupied and occupied state images of the molecule,
we can identify the relation between the molecule structure and the
height distribution. The result is schematically shown by superimposing
the skeleton of the molecule on the topographic image. The structure
and contrast distribution can be summarized as follows: (1) the molecules
in the neighboring rows have different azimuthal rotation angles as
in phase I and (2) one of the four lobes is highlighted whose position
appears in an alternative manner in the neighboring row.

We
show the temporal model for this film with a top view in Figure 2d and with a cross-sectional
view in Figure 2e.
We consider that the asymmetric height distribution among the four
lobes is deduced from the canted bonding of the molecule, as indicated
in Figure 2e. The direction
of the tilt is identical among the rows that are twisted if compared
with the one of the neighboring rows.

The stacking of the second
layer on the first layer is depicted
in the model of Figure 2d. We found that the unit cell of phase IIa is skewed
from that of phase I (the length from 1.30 × 2.60 to 1.22 ×
2.77 nm2 and the angle from 60 to 64°). The structural
change from phase I to IIa should be related to the relaxation
of the film structure due to the decreased interaction with the substrate.

The tilt angle of the molecule can be roughly estimated by considering
the height difference of the two lobes along the canted direction,
measured as 0.18 nm, and the size of the molecule of 1.30 nm. This
yields arcsin(0.18/1.3) ≈ 8° for the estimated tilt angle
from the flat-lying configuration. A similar tilted configuration
was reported for MPc. For the CoPc molecule, they found a tilted stacking
in the second layer in which the tilt angle has been estimated as
3°.16 The authors claim that the canted
configuration observed in the second and higher layers is due to the
polymorphs of the crystal of the MPc molecules. We can find a case
where a further canted bonding configuration in the second layer of
the FePc molecule film grown on Au(111), in which the inclination
has been claimed to be about 40°.21 In the estimation of the angle, the authors observed an isolated
FePc molecule in the second layer since the height difference between
the lobes can be measured more precisely for the isolated molecule
compared to the case for the one in the film.

Figure 2f illustrates
dI/dV spectra measured on the lobe
of the molecule of phase IIa; two sharp features are observed
at −1.0 and −0.7 V together with weak features at 0.77
and 1.1 V. The sharp peaks in the occupied state are obviously corresponding
to the features of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO-1
observed in Figure 1f, which are remarkably enhanced and the shift to the lower energy
after partially decoupled from the Au substrate due to the presence
of the first layer. We also see that the weak features in the unoccupied
state in Figure 1f
shift to higher energy without a large change in their intensity.
However, these features develop into a strong peak as lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) at 0.79 V in the spectrum obtained on the
center of the molecule (Figure 2g), while HOMO and HOMO-1 are depressed with a little change
in energy position. We measured spectra on the nonhighlighted lobes
of the molecule in the phase IIa film, which was similar
to those obtained on the center of the molecule in the same film.

Next, we discuss another phase of the second layer labeled IIb. Figure 3a
displays the surface area where two phases of IIa and IIb coexist. These two types of the second layers were formed
on different domains of the first layer of phase I and not found next
to each other. The height difference between the layers of phase IIb and phase I is ∼230 pm, which was higher than that
between IIa and I.

layer; phase IIa and phase IIb (50 × 50

c2 are unit vectors. Skeleton of two molecules are marked by crosses;

marked by white circles. (c) Top view of the model of IIb; molecules in phase I are colored in light-blue. (d) Side view of
IIb and I. (e) dI/dV

I and IIb (30 × 10 nm2, 0.5 V, 90 pA).
(h) dI/dV measured at the center
of the molecule in phase III (I = 0.1 nA, Vs = 0.5 V, Vrms =
20 mV).

The lattice and the azimuthal
angle of the molecule can be observed
in the magnified image of Figure 3b. For an eye guide, the molecular model is superimposed
on the topographic image by a simplified cross representing the two
symmetry lines of the molecule.

We should note that, unlike
the cases of phases I and IIa, the molecules are directing
to a single direction and the alternative
rotational angle between the neighboring molecules is no more observed.
The unit cell is defined by c1 and c2, which have the sizes of 1.23 and 1.43 nm, respectively,
with an angle of 63°, in which c1 is
rotated ∼10° from the [−110] direction of the Au
lattice. Thus, the unit vector of c2 is almost
half in the length if compared with a2 due
to the absence of the azimuthal rotation. Similar structures can be
seen in the previous works for CoPc/Cu(111),23 SnPc/NaCl,27 and FePc/Ag(111).28

If we assume a flat-lying bonding configuration
with the lattice
parameters and rotation angles given above, the molecule alignment
is like the model illustrated in Figure 3c. In this configuration, the overlap of
the S atoms is expected at the site marked by the blue and white circles
in Figure 3b, which
causes a large steric repulsion. One way to avoid this repulsion is
to tilt the molecules, which increases the vertical gap between sulfur
atoms, as illustrated in Figure 3d. In Figure 3b, only two lobes out of the four lobes can be clearly seen
and the others are almost invisible, the former of which is marked
by blue dots and the latter by white dots in Figure 3b. The contrast variation indicates that
the molecule is titled where the blue lobes are lifted and the white
lobes are closer to the substrate. To estimate the tilt angle quantitatively,
we like to observe an isolated molecule as discussed for the FePc
molecule in the previous paragraph.

For this purpose, we employ
the third layer grown on the second
layer of phase IIb. We consider that the bright molecules
observed in Figure 3b are the isolated molecules of the initial stage of the third layer.
The bright molecule is observed at the on-top site of phase IIb, and the intramolecular structure looks similar to that of
the second layer. However, there is an intriguing difference in the
electronic states in the dI/dV spectra
obtained at the lower molecule (second layer) and at the higher molecule
(third layer), which are shown in Figure 3e,f, respectively. The features corresponding
to HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO + 1 are observed at the energies of
−1.30, −0.81, 0.71, and 1.1 V for the second layer molecule
in Figure 3e and at
−1.23, −0.99, 0.41, and 0.79 V for the third layer in Figure 3f, respectively.
In the latter case, the energy separation between the occupied states
becomes smaller and the intensive HOMO-1 peak is remarkably weakened,
as shown on the left side of Figure 3f. On the other hand, the energy gap between LUMO and
LUMO + 1 has an almost constant value of ∼0.38 V for both the
second and third layers but the peak position is shifted toward the
Fermi level for the third-layer molecule.

The evidence that
the bright features in Figure 3b correspond to the third-layer molecule
can be obtained by comparing the STS spectrum obtained on each of
them. As shown in Figure 3h, STS on the third-layer molecule is almost identical to
that of the bright molecules shown in Figure 3f. In addition, the height of this film from
the IIb phase is 0.23 nm, the same as that observed for
the bright molecules from phase IIb. These features support
that the bright spots in Figure 3b are the molecules in the third layer.

The molecular
lattice in Figure 3g is identical to that of phase IIb, except
the appearance of pairing of the two rows of molecules and a gap between
the pairs. Combined with the observation that the third-layer molecule
is found at the on-top site on the film of phase IIb, we
consider that the molecules in phase IIb and in the third
layer have a similar bonding configuration. Following the method shown
for the FePc on Au(111),21 we can calculate
the most accurate tilt angle from the isolated molecule. Thus, we
focus on the bright molecule in the image of Figure 3b, which is the isolated molecule in the
third layer. We can estimate the tilt angle from the height difference
between the two lobes, which indicates a height difference of 250
pm and an angle of ∼11°. The tilt angle is large enough
to make an enough space to avoid the steric repulsion between the
blue and white parts of Figure 3b.

Now, we discuss the magnetic property of the CoTTDPz
molecule on
Au(111). The magnetic properties of the molecule in the bulk and thick
film were reported by our group;13,14 the results
show a weak antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic ordering, respectively,
and the spin is located on the Co atom at the center.

We examine
the STS spectrum near the Fermi level for the isolated
CoTTDPz molecule on the Au(111) surface shown in Figure 4a. Although we expect that
the spins are at the center of the molecule, the obtained spectrum
illustrated in Figure 4b shows no Kondo resonance. The absence of the Kondo feature suggests
that the molecule spin is quenched due to a molecule–substrate
interaction.

at the center of molecule shown in (a), I = 80 pA, Vs = 80 mV, Vrms =
1 mV. (c) Image of molecules adsorbed at perimeter of IIb (20 × 20 nm2, 0.7 V, 320 pA); tip positions for
spectra in (d) are illustrated in the upper right panel. (d) dI/dV measured on target molecules shown

(d). (f) Schematic model of molecules at the perimeter; tip positions
for spectra are illustrated by triangles.

A similar case has been investigated for the CoPc molecule. The
CoPc molecule has a spin of S = 1/2 in vacuum,29 which is located in the dz2 orbital. Zhao et al. examined
the Kondo state of CoPc adsorbed on Au(111). No Kondo feature is observed
for the CoPc deposited on the Au(111) surface.30 Nonmagnetic Co2+ for the nondistorted CoPc molecule
adsorbed on Au(111) was confirmed by other experimental24 and theoretical31 studies. In these reports, the disappearance of the spin is explained
by the filling of the dz2 state as a result of charge transfer from the substrate.

For the molecule in the multilayer film, it is expected that the
molecule–substrate interaction is weakened by the presence
of the underlying film, which makes the spin return to the Co atom.
Stepanow et al. examined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray
magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) for the same system.32 They showed that three-dimensional (3d) magnetic
moment exists in the dz2 state for the
multilayer film of CoPc. Chen and co-workers demonstrated the Kondo
resonance for the CoPc molecule in the second layer.33

Although we expected a similar behavior for the CoTTDPz
molecule
on Au(111), the dI/dV spectra near
the Fermi level obtained at the molecules of phase IIa,
IIb, and III did not show any feature of the Kondo resonance.
The absence of the Kondo resonance indicates that the quenching of
the Co spin by charge transfer is active on phase III.

Nevertheless,
we detected the Kondo resonance at the isolated molecules
in the third layer on phase IIb. We show the topographic
image of such molecules in Figure 4c together with the obtained Kondo peaks in Figure 4d, where the colored
circles in Figure 4c indicate the positions where the spectra plotted with the same
color in Figure 4d
were obtained. At the ligand position of the isolated molecule adsorbed
at the edge of the film of phase IIb (dark-blue circle),
we obtained a sharp Kondo peak, whose width is 7.6 mV. On the other
hand, the lobe at the green position provides a wider peak with a
width of 24 mV. In addition, we see a characteristic dip at the Fermi
level. For the right-hand molecule, the lobe marked by the red circle
shows a peak with a further wide peak width.

Nagaoka et al.
introduced a formula for the temperature dependence
of the Kondo peak width, Γ(T)  where Γ is the width of the Kondo peak, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and TK is the Kondo temperature. The fitting of the dark-blue
plot of Figure 4d yields Tk = 31 K, while the green curve gives Tk = 98 K for the Kondo part of the deconvoluted
peak.

It is well established that Tk is strongly
affected by the distance between the spin and substrate; the stronger
the interaction, the higher the Kondo temperature.25,34,35 In our case, the dark-blue lobe of the left
molecule in Figure 4c was at the perimeter of IIb and fuzzy in the image.
Since molecules in IIb were tilted, the target was most
likely separated from the layer of phase IIb which induces
a weak coupling with the substrate followed by the recovery of the
spin to the Co atom.

On the other hand, the green lobe is attached
to the layer of phase
IIb, whose schematic model is shown in Figure 4f. The higher TK observed for the green curve reveals this difference.

In addition, the green plot of Figure 4e has a sharp dip at the Fermi level, a ladder-type
change of the conductance at the symmetric positions around the Fermi
level forming a diplike feature near the Fermi level. The dip feature
in the dI/dV plot at the Fermi level
was observed in the conductance plot for the atom/molecule on the
insulating layer or in the multilayer film; examples of the former
can be seen for the system of Mn atom on Al2O3/NiAl,36 FePc molecule on the Cu(111)(2
× 1)–O surface,37 and the ones
for the latter are the organic radical molecule (C28H25O2N4) on Au(111),38 the TbPc2 molecule of the multiple layer on
Ag(111),39 and CoPc on Pb.33 For the former two cases, the conversion of the Kondo peak
in the dI/dV spectrum to dips is
a characteristic of the inelastic process. The origin of the dips
is attributed to the inelastic spin-flip process in which the tunneling
electron excites spin states appearing as inelastic components in
the dI/dV spectrum. The experiment
on the CoPc molecule was executed in its multiple-layer film (third
to fifth layer) grown on the lead surface at the sample temperature
at 0.4 K and with a magnetic field of 11 T. The inelastic feature
appeared at ∼18 meV. The energy is much higher than that expected
for the excitation of the 1/2 spin. Instead, it is considerably due
to a collective spin excitation of the chain of −Co–N–Co–.
This chain is formed in the surface-normal direction by the stacking
of multiple CoPc layers where the Co atom is located at the on-top
position of the N atom of the inner circle. The collective spin excitation
of this antiferromagnetic chain forms the IE feature.

We consider
that the green curve is composed of the Kondo peak
and the IETS dip. The dip has a width of ∼ 6 meV, which is
much larger than that expected from the spin excitation of the 1/2
spin in the magnetic field of 3 T. Similar to the CoPc case mentioned
above, we should consider the chain formation for the CoTTDPz molecule
in the surface-normal direction, and larger energy is needed for the
spin-flip due to the collective spin excitation.

The dI/dV spectrum obtain at
the red point of Figure 4c shows a broad feature corresponding to TK of ∼165 K, which suggests a stronger bonding with the substrate
than that obtained at the edge of the islands.

Summary
In summary,
we investigated the structure and electronic/spin configuration
of the film of the Co tetrakis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) porphyrazines (CoTTDPz)
molecule adsorbed on the Au(111) surface. CoTTDPz has a similar structure
to the Co phthalocyanine molecule except that its perimeter is terminated
with S and N atoms instead of C–H. The active nature of the
S and N atoms compared to that of the C–H species should form
enhanced molecule–substrate and molecule–molecule interactions.
We investigate their effect on the structural and electronic properties.

In the first layer, we find an ordered molecular lattice with a
threefold symmetry where a nearest-neighbor distance of 1.30 nm was
measured, which is significantly shorter than that observed for the
metal Pc molecule. The unit cell of the lattice contains two molecules
that are rotated by 60° relative to each other. The azimuthal
rotation is considerably due to the stronger interaction between the
S atom at the apex of the ligand and the N atom in the inner ring.
By this rotation, a compact lattice can be realized compared to MPc
molecules on the Au(111) surface.

In the second layer, we found
two types of bonding configurations.
The first one, phase IIa, shows a similar structure to
that of the first layer. However, the molecules are tilted from the
flat-lying configuration and the tilting direction alternatively changes
neighboring molecules. The other phase of the second layer, phase
IIb, shows the absence of the azimuthal rotation between
neighboring molecules. Instead, they show a higher tilted angle to
avoid steric repulsion. Apparent stronger interaction between the
molecule and the substrate can be seen in the STS, including the finding
of the adsorbate-induced state near the Fermi level that was observed
previously for CoPc on the Cu(111) surface, in agreement for the weak
interaction case on Au(111).

In addition, the STS spectra observed
in the second and third layers
show a significant change, indicating that the effect of the substrate
is not completely shielded in the second layer. In both phases IIa and IIb, the Co d state arises a sharp peak as
LUMO at around 0.8 V, but the HOMO peak from the molecule ligand is
much stronger in IIb; this result is reproducible, and
the source of the enhancement remains a mystery. The HOMO features
are weakened in the third layer (both protrusion and film), while
a LUMO + 1 peak arises at the position that is 0.4 V higher than LUMO;
this peak is more likely due to the vibrational mode on the molecule,
as reported before.27 The strong interaction
between the molecule and the substrate also appears in the spin state
examined by the detection of the Kondo state. Even though the existence
of the spin was confirmed for the bulk and thick films of this molecule,
no Kondo features are detected for the molecules in the first, second,
and third layers except for the isolated molecule in the third layer.

Experimental
Section
Experiments were carried out using a Unisoku LT-STM
operated at
∼4.7 K with a base pressure of 10–8 Pa. The
Au(111) substrate was prepared by repeated cycles of Ar+ sputtering and annealing in ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions. The
CoTTDPz molecule was deposited onto the Au substrate held at room
temperature by heating a Ta boat. The STS measurement was carried
out using the lock-in amp technique in which modulation voltage, Vrms, was superimposed on the tunneling voltage.
