In
this study, we explored the dyeing behavior of cotton with reactive
dyes in poly(ethylene glycol)-based reverse micelle system in nonaqueous
alkane medium of nonane (C9H20). Calibration
of dyeing databases for both conventional aqueous-based dyeing method
and nonaqueous nonane reverse micellar dyeing method was initially
established, along with simulated dyeing of standard samples with
known concentrations. Several color difference formulae were used
to conduct computer color matching (CCM), by matching the color between
batch samples and the standard samples, for both dyeing methods. Excellent
color matching results were achieved as both dyeing methods showed
that the CCM-predicted concentrations were nearly the same as the
known concentrations. It indicates that utilizing nonane as a solvent
to facilitate reverse micellar dyeing of cotton can achieve good color
matching when compared with that of the conventional aqueous-based
dyeing system. Relative unlevelness indices were used to evaluate
the evenness of the dyed samples. Good to excellent levelness results
were obtained, comparable to that of the conventional aqueous-based
dyeing system. Color fastness to laundering of nonane reverse micellar
dyed samples was found to be good for industrial applications. In
addition, during the reverse micellar dyeing process, only very low
level of volatile organic compound content was detected and 98% nonane
could be recovered simply by fractional distillation. The results
in this study explored the practical usage of nonane nonaqueous reverse
micellar approach on the dyeing of cotton with the use of reactive
dyes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cotton dyeing with the
use of reactive dyes requires enormous amounts
of salt to facilitate dye exhaustion and absorption1 and after dyeing, large amounts of water are required for
cleaning the dyed fabrics, which increases the need for effluent treatment
before discharging.2,3 As the effluents discharged affect
the ecological system adversely and the environmental cost of effluent
treatment is huge, many alternative ways, such as dyeing with low-salt
or salt-free content,4−6 natural mordants dyeing,7−10 reusing wastewater as one of
the water source for dyeing,11 and supercritical
fluid dyeing using carbon dioxide,8,12−14 have been proposed. Despite these proposed methods, the use of reverse
micelles as the medium for nonaqueous textile dyeing has been considered
for achieving ecological friendliness, energy saving, and safety in
the working environment.15,16 Reverse micelles, spherical
aggregates in nanoscale, are self-assembled and formed by the use
of certain surfactants in nonpolar medium.17,18 They are able to solubilize small amounts of water in their interior
regions, providing a stable aqueous microenvironment, named water
pool, in nonaqueous dyeing medium. Although many research studies
have investigated the dyeing of cotton fiber with the use of nonionic
reverse micelles in nonaqueous medium,16,19−21 all of them focused on primary colors. In industrial production,
a variety of colors are produced with the use of primary colors (red,
yellow, and blue) as the base, and the aesthetic appearance of most
textile products is a mixture of colors rather than a single color.
Thus, color matching is an important aspect in industrial dyeing applications.22,23

In our previous research, we successfully dyed cotton fabric
with
reactive dyes of primary colors (red, blue, and yellow)16 with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based reverse
micelle system in nonaqueous alkane medium of heptane and octane.
Computer color matching (CCM) has also been conducted with the use
of decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane24 and
octane.25 In this study, we explore the
PEG-based reverse micelle system in nonane (which has less harmful
effect than heptane and octane) for dyeing cotton with reactive dyes
of primary colors. To meet the requirements of the industrial application,
we also study the possibility of applying CCM system on nonane reverse
micellar dyeing system of cotton and finally assess the levelness
of dyed samples. Color fastness of the nonane reverse micellar dyed
samples is investigated. To investigate the environmental issues of
the reverse micellar dyeing process, volatile organic compound (VOC)
content and the solvent recovery efficiency would be studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Reflectance Curves of Batch
and Standard Samples
Figure 1 shows the
reflectance curves of red (Figure 1a), yellow (Figure 1b), and blue (Figure 1c) color batch samples, respectively. The results show
that reflectance values, from 400 to 700 nm wavelength, of the batch
samples dyed in nonane medium at each dye concentration (0.1, 0.5,
1.5, 2.5, and 3.5%) are lower than batch samples dyed in water medium.
This indicates that in nonane reverse micellar dyeing system, the
absorption of dye in the fiber and the color yield of the dyed batch
samples are higher with darker shade in appearance than that of the
dyed batch samples in water medium. Concerning reflectance curves
of three colors (red, blue, and yellow), the red color at each dye
concentration had the most significant reflectance value difference,
whereas the differences in reflectance values of yellow color and
blue color are less significant. This indicates that using nonionic
PEG-based reverse micelle nonane-assisted dyeing approach can enhance
color yield of fabrics even though same dye concentration is used.

Figure 1 Reflectance
curves of (a) red; (b) yellow; (c) blue; and (d) mixed
color.

Figure 1d shows
the reflectance curves of color mixture of the standard samples. The
reflectance values of the nonane-dyed standard samples at dye concentration
from 0.3 to 3.0% are also lower than that of the water-dyed standard
samples. No overlap is found in reflectance curves. This indicates
that the color yield of the nonane-dyed standard sample is higher,
with higher dye absorption and fixation in fiber, and the shade thus
appears darker in comparison with the water-dyed standard samples.

The results illustrate that the shape of the reflectance curves
of the water-dyed and nonane-dyed batch and standard samples are similar
to each other. No peak-shifting of the curves is observed even though
reflectance values of the dyed samples are not the same. This indicates
that the use of nonane as the medium for dyeing of cotton fiber caused
no chromatic change to the color of the dyed samples, and it also
proves that using nonane solvent to facilitate the preparation and
formation of PEG-based reverse micelles and as the medium for nonaqueous
dyeing of cotton can be an alternative way for achieving water-saving
and salt-free dyeing of cotton fiber and for computerized color matching
with no chromatic shift.

2.2 Calibration Results
The calibration
curves of three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) of water-dyed
and nonane-dyed batch samples are shown in Figure 2. The calibration curve is plotted with K/Stotal value against the concentration
of dye (% owf). The results from Figure 2 reveal that K/Stotal values of three colors of the nonane-dyed batch
samples in reverse micelle approach are higher than that of the water-dyed
batch samples. This indicates that using reverse micelle nonane nonaqueous
dyeing approach can gain a better color yield than using conventional
aqueous-based dyeing approach, and the use of nonane solvent does
not have any adverse effects on covalent bonding between reactive
dye and cotton fiber. The possible reason to explain is the utilization
of PEG-based reverse micelle in nonaqueous dyeing, reducing the ionization
effect between the dye molecules and the fiber. It also enhances the
swelling of the cotton fiber.16,20 Another reason is the
utilization of PEG-based reverse micelle in nonane-assisted dyeing
approach, which minimizes the effect of hydrolysis of reactive dye
in the dyeing process and enhances the adsorption behavior of the
reverse micelles onto the fiber surface.27−29

Figure 2 Plotted calibration curves
of three colors of water and nonane-dyed
batch samples.

The linearity of the
calibration curves is expressed in terms of R-square
(R2), a commonly used
method for the measurement of goodness-of-fit of a regression.30R2 values are between
0 and 1, in which 0 means nonlinear in structure and 1 means linear
in structure. Figure 2 revealed that R2 values of fabrics dyed
in water medium were between 0.9948 (water yellow) and 0.9998 (water
blue), whereas R2 values of fabrics dyed
by reverse micelle in nonane medium were between 0.9959 (nonane yellow)
and 0.9995 (nonane red and blue). This indicates that calibration
curves of water-dyed and nonane-dyed samples are linear in structure,
which is ideal for CCM.22,23

2.3 CCM-Predicted
Recipes
The CCM-predicted
recipes of water-dyed and nonane-dyed standard samples were illustrated
in Table 1, and the
results reveal that the CCM-predicted recipes generated by using different
color difference formulae for standard sample 1 are nearly the same
(yellow: 0.10, blue: 0.09, and red: 0.08). The CCM-predicted recipes
generated for standard sample 3 are also constant (yellow: 0.88, blue:
0.76, and red: 0.83) except FMC2 (yellow: 0.78, blue: 0.81, and red:
0.84). However, the CCM-predicted recipes generated by standard sample
2 are divided into two groups. One group includes CIEL*a*b*, ANLAB,
HunterLab, and CIE94 1.0 (yellow: 0.50, blue: 0.44, and red: 0.44),
whereas results of the others are yellow: 0.42, blue: 0.48, and red:
0.50. These results indicate that CCM-predicted recipe variations
are higher for standard sample 2 (water color mixture 1.5%), followed
by standard sample 3 (water color mixture 3.0%) and standard sample
1 (water color mixture 0.3%).

Table 1 shows the
CCM-predicted recipes of standard samples dyed by nonane reverse micellar
approach with the use of different color difference equations. The
CCM recipes generated for standard sample 5 (yellow: 0.52, blue: 0.49,
and red: 0.52) and standard sample 6 (yellow: 1.02, blue: 1.03, and
red: 1.03) are consistent, although different color difference formulae
are used. For standard sample 4 (0.3%), the CCM-predicted recipes
generated by using different color difference equations are also constant
(yellow: 0.10, blue: 0.11, and red: 0.09) except FMC2 (yellow: 0.07,
blue: 0.08, and red: 0.09). These results indicate that the CCM recipes
predicted for samples dyed in nonane solvent medium have smaller variations
than in conventional water-based medium.

2.4 Levelness
Table 2 summarizes
the relative unlevelness indices
(RUIs) value and the visual assessment of the levelness of cotton
fabrics dyed in water aqueous medium and in nonane nonaqueous medium.
The RUI of fabrics dyed in water medium varies from 0.02 to 0.34,
whereas the RUI of fabrics dyed in nonane medium varies from 0.02
to 0.38. It means that both water-dyed and nonane-dyed standard and
the batch samples can gain good to excellent levelness, which indicates
that in reverse micellar nonane-assisted dyeing system, most dye molecules
are in nonaggregate form and are well-dispersed in the fabric to avoid
unlevelness. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the water-based and reverse micelle dyed samples,
and it is obvious that the color developed in both types of samples
has good levelness.

micellar
dyed fabric (below).

2.5 Color
Fastness
The washing wetfastness
results of color change and staining of dyed samples are examined.
It shows that the color-retaining effect of nonane-reverse micellar
dyeing is comparable to that of water-based dyeing in all color depth
with a rating of 4–5. In the case of staining, nonane-reverse
micellar dyed fabrics have the color fastness similar to laundering
as water-based dyed fabrics in all color depth with a rating of 4–5.
On the basis of the color fastness to laundering results, it can be
concluded that nonane-reverse micellar dyeing system can provide dyeing
properties similar to the conventional water-based dyeing system.

2.6 VOC Content
The detection of VOC
leakage during the reverse micellar dyeing process was performed every
20 min. The VOC content was detected from 0 to less than 2 ppm in
the first 20 min. Until approximately 105 min, the VOC content reaches
a steady level (2.4 ppm). The nonane leakage is in the range of 2–3
ppm during the reverse micellar dyeing process, which is at the low
and acceptable level.

2.7 Recovery of Solvent
From the collection
of distillate, the percentage of solvent recovery is based on the
ratio of the amount of recycled solvent to the theoretical prediction
of solvent volume used before dyeing. The nonane (98%) can be recovered
for further use after the reverse micellar dyeing progress, and the
percentage of recovery of nonane can be high in efficiency.

2.8 Surface Morphology
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) has been applied to observe the surface characteristics
of cotton fibers. Observation by SEM helps in distinguishing between
reverse micellar dyed and water-based dyed samples at the fiber level.
One can demonstrate the existence of a coating through pictorial evidence
and obtain further structural information at micrometer and submicrometer
length scales.31Figure 4 shows the SEM images before and after water-based
and nonane-based dyeing processes. The surface of the untreated cotton
(Figure 4a) reveals
its characteristic natural and regular ridges with smooth surface.
The water-based dyed samples under both 0.1 and 3.5% dyes do not show
any fine structure on the fiber surface (Figure 4b,c). For cotton samples dyed in reverse
micellar dyeing system (Figure 4d,e) under both 0.1 and 3.5% dyes, some filamentous structures
are observed on the surface of most fibers in large dimension. The
surfaces appear rougher overall with fiber surface dyed in water.
For both cases, the surface features of reverse-micellar dyed cotton
are clearly different from those of the water-based dyed and untreated
cotton. The regularity of natural stripes along cotton fabric surface
had almost vanished in the reverse micellar dyed cotton. This indicates
that, after treatment with reverse micelle encapsulated dye in nonane,
irregular stripes and rough surfaces can significantly increase the
surface energy of cotton fabric, which is favorable for better diffusion
into cotton matrix and interaction of dye with the cotton surface.
The results of the reflectance curves indicated that the lower reflectance
values obtained from reverse micellar dyed cotton reveal relatively
more dye molecules adsorbed on the fiber surface than that in water-based
dyeing process.

0.1% dye
in water; (c) 3.5% dye in water; (d) 0.1% in nonane; and (e) 3.5%
in nonane.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the possibility of using PEG-based
reverse micelle in nonane medium for dyeing cotton with reactive dyes
with three primary colors as well as mixed colors. The reflectance
percentage (R %) of the reverse micellar dyed samples
in nonane medium was measured. No chromatic change was noted when
compared with water-based dyed samples. The calibration dyeing databases
for both dyeing approaches were setup, and the calibration curves
of nonane-reverse micellar dyed samples are linear. The values of R2 are between 0.9959 and 0.9995. The values
of K/Stotal of nonane-dyed
samples were generally higher than that of water-dyed samples for
each primary color. CCM was initiated with the use of several color
difference equations. The results revealed that the predicted concentrations
were similar to the known concentrations for both approaches. These
indicates that dyeing of cotton using reverse micelle approach in
nonane medium can achieve excellent color matching. RUI has been used
to evaluate the levelness of the dyed samples. The results indicate
that nonane-dyed samples can achieve good to excellent levelness,
comparable to the conventional aqueous-based dyeing approach. In addition,
color fastness to laundering results of the nonane-reverse micellar
dyed samples was found acceptable in comparison with the water-dyed
samples. Meanwhile, low VOC content but high solvent recovery efficiency
could be achieved for the proposed reverse micellar dyeing process
in nonane nonaqueous medium.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fabric
Pure-cotton interlock-knitted
fabrics with fabric structure of 40 wales per in. (wpi) and 40 courses
per in. (cpi) were initially cleaned with a solution, which contains
2 g/L soda ash and 2 g/L soap in a shaking water bath at temperature
of 70 °C for 45 min. The cleaned fabrics were then cold-rinsed,
tumble-dried, and conditioned in a room set at relative humidity of
65 ± 2% and temperature of 20 ± 2 °C for approximately
24 h before further experiments.

4.2 Reagents
PEG (12) tridecylether (C13H27(OCH2CH2)nOH) (n ≈ 12) (PEG-12), a
nonionic PEG-based surfactant, and n-octanol, a cosurfactant,
were used to facilitate the formation of reverse micelles. Nonane
(C9H20), an alkane solvent, was used as the
nonaqueous dyeing medium for reverse micellar dyeing, whereas deionized
water was used as the aqueous dyeing medium in conventional dyeing
process. Sodium chloride (NaCl), an inorganic salt, was used as an
exhausting agent in conventional aqueous-based dyeing only, whereas
soda ash (Na2CO3), an alkali commonly used in
conventional dyeing, was used as a color fixation agent for both dyeing
methods. They were of reagent grade. Reactive dyes of three primary
colors (Levafix Yellow CA, Levafix Red CA and Levafix Blue CA) used
were provided by DyStar from China, and they were directly used with
no further purification.

4.3 Cotton Dyeing in Water
for Establishing Calibration
Curves
To ensure good levelness, liquor-to-goods ratio of
50:1 was used for calibration dyeing, and the dyeing recipe (dye concentration,
amount of auxiliaries) was shown in Table 1. On the basis of the dye concentration (percentage
on weight of fabric, % owf), the corresponding amount of NaCl was
added during the dyeing process. To carry out the calibration dyeing
in aqueous medium, cotton fabric was initially immersed in the dye
liquor containing salt and dye. The prepared dye liquor was then put
into the shaking water bath set at 30 °C. The dyeing process
was launched at 60 °C for 40 min, followed by color fixation
by adding the corresponding amount of Na2CO3 (Table 3) into the
dye liquor at 60 °C for an hour. To remove the unfixed dye and
auxiliary residues in the fabrics, soaping treatment, which immerses
the dyed cotton fabric in soap solution (2 g/L) and rinses for 15
min at 60 °C for 2 times, was conducted after the fixation process.
The cleaned fabrics were then cold-rinsed, tumble dried, and conditioned
in a room set at a relative humidity of 65 ± 2% and a temperature
of 20 ± 2 °C, for approximately 24 h before further experiments.24,25 The dyed fabrics are termed as batch samples for establishing the
calibration curves.

4.4 Cotton Dyeing in Reverse Micellar System for
Making Calibration Curves
PEG-based nonionic reverse micelles
were simply prepared by injection at room temperature. The PEG-12
nonionic surfactant and cosurfactant (n-octanol)
were first premixed in a surfactant to cosurfactant ratio (1:7 in
mole ratio) with agitation. The mixture was then dissolved in nonane
to facilitate the self-assembly of PEG-based reverse micelles. Solvent-to-cotton
weight ratio (v/w) used was 8:1. Reactive-dye aqueous solutions of
controlled amount were injected dropwise into the PEG-based reverse
micellar system and were then stirred vigorously for 2 min until the
solutions with reverse micelle, encapsulated reactive dye, were well-dispersed24,25 (Table 4).

Micelle Solution per gram of Cotton

(g)	1.56

Calibration dyeing was initiated at surfactant to water ratio of
1:20 mole ratio. The reverse micellar dye liquors were first prepared
by the addition of corresponding amounts of surfactant, cosurfactant,
dye solutions, and nonane solvent. The whole dyeing and fixation processes
were conducted without addition of electrolytes [salt, (NaCl)]. To
carry out the dyeing, the cotton fabric was first immersed in the
dye liquor containing reverse micelle encapsulated reactive dye (in
a stoppered flask) and was then put into the shaking water bath. The
dyeing of cotton was conducted at 70 °C for 40 min. After that,
fixation of dye was conducted by the addition of soda ash (Table 1) into the dye liquors
at 70 °C for an hour. After fixation, soaping treatment, which
immerses the dyed cotton fabric in soap solution (2 g/L) and rinses
for 15 min at 60 °C for two times, was conducted after the fixation
process. The cleaned fabrics were then cold-rinsed, tumble dried,
and conditioned in a room set at relative humidity of 65 ± 2%
and temperature of 20 ± 2 °C for approximately 24 h before
further experiments.24,25 The dyed fabrics are termed as
batch samples for establishing the calibration curves.

4.5 Calibration Curves Setup
The color
yield of the batch samples was obtained by using a Macbeth Color-Eye
7000A spectrophotometer (X-Rite, USA) to measure the reflectance (R %) and K/S values on
the face side of the dyed fabrics. The measurement was set according
to the following parameters: (i) specular included; (ii) large aperture
(30 mm); (iii) folding the samples two times to ensure opacity; (iv)
illuminant D65 light source; and (v) 10° standard
observer. The calibration curves were plotted with K/Stotal value against concentration of
dye on the weight of fiber (% owf). K/S values at specific wavelengths were calculated by eq 1. In this study, the color yield,
expressed in terms of K/Stotal value, was calculated by the summation of each K/S values between 400 and 700 nm wavelength, within
the visible spectrum with data taken at 10 nm intervals. The higher
the K/Stotal value, the
more will be the dye uptake by the dyed fabrics and the better will
be the color yield. After inputting K/Stotal values and the related concentration into the spectrophotometer,
calibration curves could be established in the spectrophotometer for
computerized color matching. 1  where K is the absorption
coefficient depending on colorant concentration; S is the scattering coefficient caused by the dyed sample; and R is the reflectance of the dyed sample at a specific wavelength.22,23

4.6 Simulated Dyeing with Known Dye Concentration
To prepare samples for CCM, simulated dyeing with a known concentration
of dye was launched to produce color mixture for both conventional
aqueous-based and nonane-assisted reverse micellar methods. The cotton
fabrics were dyed as the standard samples. The mixture of color of
the standard samples was produced based on the dye concentration presented
in Table 5.

4.7 Dye Recipe Prediction with
Color Difference
Formulae
Different color difference formulae, which include
CIEL*u*v*, CIEL*a*b*, HunteLab, ANLAB, FMC2, JPC79, BFD 1.0, CMC 1.0,
and CIE94 1.0, were used for predicting the dye recipe for the standard
samples; the standard samples were prepared by mixing the known concentration
of dye in the dye recipe (Table 3). The K/Stotal of the dyed standard samples was measured by Color-Eye 7000A spectrophotometer
(X-Rite, USA) using light source illuminant D65 under specular
included condition. Standard observer of 10° with a large aperture
(30 mm) was used. By obtaining the K/Stotal value and using the established calibration curves
in the spectrophotometer, the concentration of dye in the recipe to
produce the standard samples could be predicted by different color
difference formulae. As a result, the known dye concentration (termed
as “known concentration”) and predicted dye concentration
(termed as “predicted concentration”) obtained from
CCM in conventional aqueous-based and nonane-reverse micellar dyeing
methods could be compared for accuracy.

4.8 Levelness
Evaluation
The RUIs were
used for the evaluation of the levelness of the dyed batch and standard
sample and were calculated through the use of reflectance values of
four randomly selected spots on the dyed standard and batch samples
within the visible spectrum (λ = 400–700 nm) with data
taken at 10 nm intervals. The apparatus used was Macbeth Color-Eye
7000A spectrophotometer (X-Rite, USA) using the following parameters
as the condition of measurements: (a) illuminant D65 light
source; (b) specular included; (c) standard observer of 10°;
and (d) large aperture (30 mm). The RUI was composed of four main
equations. It includes (a) the standard deviation (sλ) of reflectance measured at a specific wavelength
(eq 2); (b) the uncorrected
RUI (RUIu) derived by the sum of standard deviations for
all wavelengths (eq 3); (c) corrected RUI (RUIc) derived by the sum of coefficients
of variation of reflectance values (eq 4); and (d) RUI derived by multiple coefficients of
variation of reflectance by the photopic relative luminous efficiency
function (Vλ) (eq 5).26 The interpretation
of RUI values as suggested is (i) excellent levelness (unlevelness
not detectable) (RUI < 0.2); (ii) good levelness (noticeable unlevelness
under close examination) (RUI = 0.2–0.49); (iii) poor levelness
(apparent unlevelness) (RUI = 0.5–1.0); and (iv) bad levelness
(conspicuous unlevelness) (RUI > 1.0). 2   3   4   5  

4.9 Color
Fastness
The color fastness
to laundering of the batch samples was evaluated by AATCC Test Method
61-1A (2013) (color fastness to Laundering: Accelerated). The color
change of the dyed fabric and staining of adjacent multifiber fabric
were evaluated, and the rating of 5 is the excellent rating whereas
1 is the poorest rating.

4.10 VOC Content
A
GX6000 gas detector
(range 0–6000 ppm) was used for detecting the VOC content during
the reverse micellar dyeing process.

4.11 Recovery
of Solvent
After reverse
micellar dyeing, 40 mL of the dyeing solution was placed into 100
mL round-bottom flask with magnetic stirring for distillation. The
round-bottom flask was immersed in an oil bath and connected with
a thermometer and a condenser tube via a three-way adapter. The distillation
process was controlled at a rate of 1 drop per s under appropriate
heating power. The temperatures measured at the intersection region
of the three-way adapter was 149 °C for nonane. The distillate
was completely collected when the temperature starts to drop and no
further distillates were collected after condensation. The collected
distillates were then transferred into a separatory funnel and two-phase
layers can be observed. A small amount of water was at the bottom
layer, and the upper layer was the recycled solvent.

4.12 Surface Morphology
SEM was used
to observe the surface textures of untreated, water-treated, and nonane-treated
cotton fiber samples. The SEM used is a JSM-6490 field-emission scanning
electron microscope (JEOL, Japan), accompanied with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy system at 20  kV accelerating voltage. The
samples were sputtered with a layer of thin conductive gold, prior
to the observation.
