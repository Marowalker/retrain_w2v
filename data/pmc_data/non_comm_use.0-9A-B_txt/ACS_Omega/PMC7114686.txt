Sustainable resource recovery is
the key to manage the overburden
of various waste entities of mining practices. The present study demonstrates
for the first time a novel approach for iron recovery and biodiesel
yield from two acid-adapted microalgae, Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp.
MAS3, grown in synthetic acid mine drainage (SAMD). Virtually, there
was no difference in the growth of the strain MAS3 both in Bold’s
basal medium (control) and SAMD. Using the IC50 level (200
mg L–1) and a lower concentration (50 mg L–1) of iron in SAMD, the cell granularity, exopolysaccharide (EPS)
secretion, iron recovery, and biodiesel were assessed in both the
strains. Both cell granularity and accumulation of EPS were significantly
altered under metal stress in SAMD, resulting in an increase in total
accumulation of iron. Growth of the microalgal strains in SAMD yielded
12–20% biodiesel, with no traces of heavy metals, from the
biomass. The entire amount of iron, accumulated intracellularly, was
recovered in the residual biomass. Our results on the ability of the
acid-adapted microalgal strains in iron recovery and yield of biodiesel
when grown in SAMD indicate that they could be the potential candidates
for use in bioremediation of extreme habitats like AMD.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
heavy global demand for minerals over the years led to the
depletion of their resources, and the intensive mining resulted in
several hazards from derelict mines.1,2 The environmental
challenges from the mining process are also of great concern.3 The acidic effluent produced from the rock interaction
or oxidation of iron sulfide (FeS2), termed as acid mine
drainage (AMD), is the most hazardous form of post-mining activity.4 The environmental impact of AMD is very high,
contributing to the bioavailability of heavy metals (HMs) principally
in water and soils. Because of the widespread occurrence of AMD, nearly
19,000 km of streams and 72,000 ha of lakes and reservoirs are affected
throughout the world.3 The water from Maurliden
mine in Sweden contains high concentrations of iron (400 mg L–1) and zinc (450 mg L–1) besides
the presence of other metals such as Mn and Cd in trace concentrations.5 In South Africa, the iron concentration in acidic
effluents (pH 2.1–3.1) from coal and gold mines was >800
mg
L–1.6 At the mining-impacted
area of Iberian pyrite belt in Spain, the iron concentration in water
samples collected at different locations varied from 21.8 to 2000
mg L–1.7 The above reports
imply that iron is the most predominant metal in AMD irrespective
of the conditions at geological strata of the mining areas.

Current mining waste management practices are aligned toward linear
economic thinking (take-make-waste), necessitating the implementation
of sustainable approaches to reuse and efficiently manage the resources.8 The recovery of metals like iron from AMD is
a valuable approach to meet their discharge limits while maintaining
sustainable economic approach.9 Limestone
drains, open limestone channels, and limestone diversion wells are
the standard options in the passive treatment AMD.3 Hammarstrom et al.10 reported
that the use of pulsed limestone bed systems for treating AMD reduced
the formation of coatings besides hindering treatment efficiency.
On the other hand, the active treatment processes generate copious
sludge volumes enriched with various metals thus requiring further
treatment.9 Also, the recovery of metals
from AMD using chemical precipitation produces sludge, and the metal
recycling is not a sustainable process.11 Adsorption,12 coagulation,13 chemical precipitation,14 and integrated filtration and chemical precipitation15 are some of the other techniques used for iron
recovery from AMD. Though biological methods for recovery of metals
through passive bioreactors are promising viable alternatives, they
require electron donors or substrates to promote and sustain the process.16,17 Microalgae that thrive in any extreme habitats from desert to AMD
by their ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions are implicated
in a wide array of biotechnological applications.18−21 Most studies on metal recovery
from synthetic solutions used dead algal biomass as the adsorbent,22,23 but the potential of acidophilic microalgae in metal recovery from
AMD has not been understood so far. The approach of biofuel production,
especially as an alternative to other fossil fuels, cannot compete
with the conventional technology due to the costs associated with
the yield of biomass and biofuel.24,25 However,,
the “green technology” involving microalgae is significant
in circular economy related to bioremediation, resource recovery,
and generation of value-added products.19 Very recently, we identified two strains of acid-tolerant microalgae, Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp. MAS3, that can grow well at pH 3.5 and remove HMs and sustainably
produce biomass for the yield of biodiesel.26−28 In the present
study, for the first time, we tested whether these acid-tolerant microalgal
strains upon prolonged adaptation for over 100 generations to acidic
conditions at pH 3.5 have the potential for sustainable iron recovery
and biodiesel production for
appropriate bioenergy feedstock when grown in a synthetic AMD (SAMD).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Growth of Acid-Adapted
Microalgae in SAMD
The acid-adapted microalgae, Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp.
MAS3, were grown in SAMD that contained 50% of phosphates originally
present in AMD (Table 1). In fact, this reduction in phosphates in SAMD is to avoid complexation
in the culture medium and increase iron bioavailability as determined
by Visual MINTEQ modeling (Table S1). Initially,
the growth of the microalgal strains in Bold’s basal medium
(BBM) and SAMD, in terms of chlorophyll, was compared (Figure 1a). Overall, the growth of
the strain MAS1 in SAMD was significantly more than that of the strain
MAS3. The calculated doubling time for the strain MAS1 was two-fold
higher in BBM compared to SAMD. Interestingly, no such difference
in generation time was observed for the strain MAS3, indicating its
better tolerance to the elevated concentrations of metals in SAMD.5 The growth inhibition in the microalgal strains
in SAMD could be due to the competition between H+ and
metal ions for cell surface binding sites, especially under acid pH.29 In the presence of a mixture of metals such
as Cu and Ni and standard BG11 phosphates, Rugnini et al.30 reported significant inhibition in the photosynthetic
activity of Desmodesmus sp. and Chlorella vulgaris. Under balanced growth conditions
at pH 2.6, the energy balance, based on amount of absorbed energy,
and the pigment content per cell were reduced in an acidophilic microalga, Chlamydomonas acidophila, due to changes in the environmental
conditions that force the microalga to adapt by reorganizing photosynthetic
apparatus and metabolic pathways.31 Concentration-dependent
growth inhibition observed at the end of 96 h by using Fe concentrations
ranging from 25 to 800 mg L–1 in both the microalgal
strains revealed an IC50 value of 200 mg L–1 (R2 = 0.94; 0.97 for MAS1 and MAS3,
respectively) (Figure S1). Spijkerman32 suggested that high concentrations of iron in
the medium tend to limit the phosphate uptake that is essential for
acidophilic algae. Especially higher concentrations of iron decrease
the bioavailable fraction of phosphates by complexation or lowering P uptake rates due to adsorption process, a phenomenon that
is common in iron-rich acidic lakes.33 Also,
ferric ion concentration exceeding 5 mmol L–1 was
too toxic for phytoplankton in an acidic river in Spain, leading the
algae to consume more ATP resulting in growth inhibition.32,34 Moreover, Visual MINTEQ data (Table S1) revealed that iron complexation with phosphates is about 0.26 and
0.32% at 50 and 200 mg L–1, respectively. Based
on the above observations, only the two concentrations, 50 and 200
mg L–1, were used in further experimentation.

2.2 Microalgal Response to Iron Levels in SAMD
Cell granularity, measured through side scatter (SSC) following
flow cytometry, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) accumulation by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were determined to assess the
microalgal response to iron at 1 mg L–1 as contained
in SAMD (Table 1) and
higher supplemental levels of 50 and 200 mg L–1 (Figure 1b). The cell granularity,
attributed mostly to intracellular changes under stress, was very
less when the microalgal strains were grown in SAMD that contained
1 mg L–1 of iron. Increased iron concentrations
in SAMD (50 and 200 mg L–1) decreased the SSC signal
in both the strains, indicating significant intracellular changes.
However, the change in granularity was significant in strain MAS3
as compared to strain MAS1. Such a decrease in cell granularity in
response to metals such as Cu and Ni was also observed in a microalga, Chlorococcum infusionum.35 Metals in high concentrations alter the cell membrane by increasing
permeability leading to enlargement of cells due to the accumulation
of photosynthetic products.36 Also, increased
cellular granularity may be due to changes in the ultrastructure as
observed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii when exposed to Cd.29 At high concentrations
of Zn (4.4 mM) in the presence of Mn and Ni at pH 3.5, Ulothrix sp., an acidophilic alga isolated from AMD, exhibited completely
disoriented thylakoids in chloroplasts.37 The secretion of EPS, as determined from FTIR peak area (arbitrary
units, au), increased at higher concentrations of iron in both the
strains of microalgae (Figure 1b). The strain MAS3 exhibited 5–10% increase in EPS
accumulation at 50–200 mg L–1 of Fe than
MAS1. Notably, MAS1 showed a significant reduction (20%) in EPS accumulation
at 50 mg Fe L–1 as compared to 1 mg L–1 but was increased subsequently at higher Fe concentrations (Figure 1b). Strains of microalgae
are known to produce more EPS under stress conditions imposed by environmental
pollutants, especially HMs,38 thus corroborating
with the present results observed at 200 mg L–1.
Likewise, Palma et al.39 reported an enhanced
EPS secretion in Chlorella sp. when
grown in mine tailing water contaminated with HMs wherein the iron
concentration was less than 1 mg L–1, indicating
the influence of other metal like Mn.

2.3 Sustainable
Iron Recovery and Biodiesel Yield
by Microalgae
Total accumulation (both external and internal)
was considered for the extent of iron recovery by the microalgal strains
grown in SAMD supplemented with 50 or 200 mg L–1 of iron. Increased Fe concentrations enhanced its total accumulation
in both the strains of MAS1 and MAS3 (Figure 2). While the extent of iron uptake is less,
the intracellular accumulation was higher which accounted for 80%
of the total accumulated iron, at 50 mg Fe L–1 in
strain MAS1. However, the extracellular accumulation was very significant
(90% of the total) when this strain was grown in the presence of 200
mg L–1 of Fe. The increase in total accumulation
of iron in strain MAS1 when iron concentration in SAMD increased from
50 to 200 mg L–1 was 3-fold, whereas the corresponding
increase in MAS3 was only 1.2-fold. Interestingly, the extracellular
accumulation of iron was significantly higher in strain MAS3 grown
in the presence of 50 or 200 mg L–1 of iron in SAMD.
The mode of adsorption and accumulation of iron is not understood
although iron uptake in microalgae is likely to include one of the
two pathways (i) active surface adsorption and passive intracellular
accumulation or (ii) passive surface adsorption and active intracellular
accumulation.41 In the presence of Fe and
Zn that are essentially involved in photosynthesis, Euglena gracilis (an acidophilic alga) accumulated
60% of Cd in chloroplasts,40 but Ni accumulation
was limited in the presence of other essential divalent metals such
as Zn, Mn, and Cu.42 Nearly 80% of total
accumulated iron accounted for extracellular accumulation in MAS1
grown in SAMD with 200 mg L–1 of iron. In fact,
higher EPS secretion associated with elevated concentrations of iron
(Figure 1b) resulted
in increased external accumulation of iron. García-Meza et
al.42 also observed significant extracellular
metal accumulation in photosynthetic biofilms from mine tailings facilitated
by more EPS secretion. Similarly, in AMD environments that contained
mixed metals, the increased accumulation of EPS was attributed to
the alleviation of metal toxicity in microalgae present in biofilms.39

Figure 2 Iron recovery (mg Fe g–1 dry wt of biomass),
in terms of accumulation (total, extracellular, and intracellular),
by strains MAS1 and MAS3 grown in the presence of 50 and 200 mg Fe
L–1 in SAMD for 96 h. The mean values (n = 3), related to a microalgal strain, carrying the same letter on
the bars are not significantly (P ≤ 0.05)
different from each other according to DMR test.

Biodiesel was extracted after in situ transesterification of the
biomass collected from the microalgal cultures grown in BBM (control)
and SAMD containing 1, 50, or 200 mg Fe L–1 (Figure 3a). In all, the biodiesel
yield increased significantly when the strains were grown in SAMD.
Among three concentrations of iron included in SAMD, 50 mg L–1 was significantly effective in yielding biodiesel. Again, it is
quite interesting to note that particularly 50 mg L–1 of iron in SAMD significantly enhanced biodiesel yield in strain
MAS1. Thus, the per cent biodiesel yield in strain MAS1 grown in 1,
50, and 200 mg Fe L–1 was 13, 20, and 15, whereas
the corresponding values for MAS3 were 12, 16, and 14. Evidently,
there was an 18–25% decrease in biodiesel production in cultures
grown in SAMD supplemented with 200 mg L–1 of iron
when compared with the concentration of 50 mg L–1. Laurens et al.43 also observed that
the biodiesel yield determined following in situ transesterification
in Chlorella and Nannochloropsis was only 9–10% of the biomass (based on dry wt). Lipids,
primarily triacylglycerols (TAGs), are synthesized under unfavorable
conditions as energy storage molecules in microalgae.44 The significant enhancement in intracellular accumulation
of iron and increased biodiesel production in MAS1 when grown in the
presence of 50 mg Fe L–1 clearly support the likely
triggered accumulation of TAGs which are the precursors for biodiesel
enhancement.27 We observed earlier that
the same strains MAS1 and MAS3 when grown in BBM supplemented with
20 mg L–1 of Fe at pH 3.5, the yield of fatty acid
methyl esters was ∼25% on dry wt basis.27 Obviously, the observed lower yield of biodiesel in this
study could be due to the presence of toxic HMs in SAMD. Concas et
al.45 suggested that increased iron concentration
could trigger oxidative stress in microalgal species, resulting in
enhanced accumulation of lipids. Also, Ren et al.46 reported that higher iron concentrations in the culture
medium induced lipid synthesis through metabolic alteration in Chlorella vulgaris.

wt of biomass) in strains
MAS1 and MAS3 grown in BBM (control) and SAMD at concentrations of
1, 50, and 200 mg Fe L–1 for 96 h; (b) iron recovery
(mg Fe g–1 dry wt) from residual biomass obtained
after extracting biodiesel. The mean values (n =
3), related to a microalgal strain, carrying the same letter on the
bars are not significantly (P ≤ 0.05) different
from each other according to DMR test.

Although iron was supplemented even at 200 mg L–1 in SAMD, no traces of iron or any other HM were detected in biodiesel
obtained from both the microalgal strains, indicating that the biodiesel
is of good quality and can be safely used as an energy source. Raikova
et al.47 determined bio-oil production
by hydrothermal liquefaction from metal-grown Spirulina biomass and observed that metals were accumulated in biomass residue
than in oil. Similarly, biodiesel obtained from microalgal biomass
cultivated in metal-contaminated flue gas showed no traces of metals.48 Interestingly, a major portion of iron that
accumulated inside the microalgal cells remained in the residual biomass
recovered after extraction of biodiesel (Figure 3b). In fact, the iron content in residual
biomass collected from both the cultures grown in the presence of
50 mg L–1 was significantly more as compared to
the higher concentration used in SAMD. For instance, the recovery
of iron from the residual biomass was 75% of the amount accumulated
intracellularly in strain MAS1 grown in SAMD with 50 mg Fe L–1, and the corresponding value for strain MAS3 was 98%. Our data demonstrate
that most of the iron accumulated in microalgal strains could be recovered
from the residual biomass left after extraction of biodiesel. Also,
the present study indicates the great potential of the two acid-tolerant
microalgae in resource recovery and biodiesel production while remediating
an AMD.

3 Conclusions
Identifying
suitable microorganisms for metal recovery and biodiesel
yield is of utmost importance in bioremediation of extreme habitats
like AMD. Two acid-tolerant strains of microalgae, Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp. MAS3, grew well in SAMD samples that contained iron at 200 mg
L–1, a concentration close to that present in real
AMD. While growing in SAMD with higher concentrations of iron (200
mg L–1), both the strains could remove significant
amounts of the metal and this recovery was directly related to the
altered cellular granularity and increased secretion of EPS under
the conditions of stress imposed by metals. Growth of both the strains
at 200 mg Fe L–1 resulted in an enhanced extracellular
accumulation of iron facilitated by increased production of EPS. In
situ transesterification of metal-enriched biomass yielded 12–20%
biodiesel at high concentrations of iron in SAMD. The entire amount
of iron in the biomass was recovered from the residual biomass left
after solvent extraction for biodiesel. This is the first study that
demonstrated the great potential of acid-tolerant microalgae in sustainable
recovery of iron and biodiesel yield when grown in extreme conditions
as exist in AMD, thus paving for the green circular economy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Microalgae and Analysis
of Growth Response
The acid-tolerant microalgal strains, Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp.
MAS3, initially maintained in BBM, were adapted to acidic conditions
for more than 100 generations by growing in BBM at pH 3.5 under the
culture conditions described earlier.26,27 The microalgal
cells growing at log phase were centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min and washed with ultrapure water twice, and the pellet
was resuspended either in BBM or SAMD (Table 1). The composition of metals used in SAMD
is based on our earlier studies related to toxicity and uptake of
HMs26,27 and wherever necessary the concentrations
of HMs in SAMD were changed. The microalgal suspension was added to
20 mL of sterilized BBM or SAMD samples contained in 50 mL Erlenmeyer
flasks to obtain a final density of 5 × 105 cells
mL–1 for initially determining the relative growth.
Varying concentrations of Fe were prepared using a stock solution
of FeSO4·7H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in ultrapure
water and passed through a sterile 0.22 μm disposable syringe
filter. Initially, the microalgae were tested for their survival in
SAMD composed of higher concentrations of HMs than those in AMD because
they exhibited tolerance to Mn, Cu, Zn, and Cd, but not Fe.27,28 Subsequently, iron concentrations ranging from 25 to 800 mg L–1 were included in SAMD to determine IC50 (the concentration of iron required for 50% growth inhibition) values
for iron in both the strains. Finally, to determine microalgal growth
and their potential in iron recovery and yield of biodiesel, concentrations
of only 50 and 200 mg L–1 of iron that correspond
to a lower and IC50 value, respectively, were used. Each
treatment was replicated thrice, and all of the flasks were incubated
under constant illumination (60 μmol m–2 s–1) with 100 rpm shaking at 25 °C.26

The microalgal growth was determined, in terms of
relative fluorescence units (RFUs) of chlorophyll, in a microplate
reader using 100 μL aliquots of the cultures withdrawn at desired
intervals as described earlier.26,27 After 96 h of growth
at pH 3.5, IC50 values for iron were determined by referring
to the dose–response curve (inhibition) following nonlinear
regression and using GraphPad prism software (version 8, USA). The
content of EPSs in the strains were analyzed by the ATR–FTIR
technique at a wave region of 900–1200 cm–1 following FTIR spectroscopy (Agilent Technologies, USA), and the
peak area was calculated using Resolutions pro software (Agilent Technologies).
Cell granularity was measured by flow cytometry using side scatter
signal collected through autofluorescence laser (695/40 nm band pass
filter) in a BD FACS Canto flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Instruments)
as described previously.26

4.2 Iron and Biodiesel Analysis
Ten milliliters
of the microalgal cultures, in triplicates, from each treatment were
withdrawn for iron analysis only after 96 h for iron analysis. The
iron content in the samples was analyzed in inductively coupled plasma–mass
spectrometer (ICP-MS, Agilent technologies, USA) as described earlier.27,28 The total, intracellular, and extracellular concentrations of iron
accumulated in the biomass were determined to account for the extent
of iron recovery from SAMD, and the values were expressed as mg g–1 of biomass (dry wt).

For analysis of biodiesel
after 96 h, 10 mL of culture suspensions were centrifuged and washed
twice with 0.025 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to remove
EPS together with metals adsorbed onto the cell surface. Following
solvent extraction using HCl–MeOH mixture and in situ transesterification,
biodiesel was then extracted with hexane. The hexane layer was removed
for quantification of biodiesel gravimetrically, and the yield values
were expressed as percentages on the basis of dry wt of biomass.28 The leftover aqueous phase together with the
residual biomass was then concentrated in a vacufuge concentrator
(Eppendorf) at 60 °C for 2 h. The biomass pellet was digested
and the digest was diluted 10 times with 5% nitric acid and used for
iron analysis in ICP-MS (Agilent technologies, USA). The biodiesel
obtained was also analyzed for iron after diluting with 5% nitric
acid. The values for iron partitioned in biodiesel and the residual
biomass were expressed as percentages.

4.3 Statistical
Analysis
The standard
deviations for the experimental data means (n = 3)
were calculated using GraphPad Prism V.8 software, and the statistical
significance (P ≤ 0.05) of the means was determined
following one-way ANOVA analysis and Duncan’s multiple range
test using IBM SPSS statistical software (version 24, USA).
