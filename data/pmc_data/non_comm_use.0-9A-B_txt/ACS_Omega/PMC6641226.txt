for the NDDO-based methods is relatively modest due to the random

Introduction
Computing accurate
reaction enthalpies for large molecules represents
a significant challenge to computational chemistry. Sengupta and Raghavachari1 recently demonstrated that their connectivity-based
hierarchy (CBH) protocol2 can be used to
compute reaction enthalpies that, on average, are within 1–2
kcal/mol of G4 theory,3 using density functional
theory and triple-ζ basis sets (DFT/TZV). Although encouraging,
the computational cost of the DFT/TZV calculations is still too high
to be routinely applied to large biomolecular systems. Here, we test
the accuracy of the CBH approach using computationally more efficient
methods, such as DFT/DZV, minimal basis set Hartree–Fock, tight-binding
DFT, and neglect-of-diatomic-differential-overlap (NDDO)-based semiempirical
methods, using the Sengupta and Raghavachari1 data set. As part of the work, we have completely automated the
CBH approach so that it only requires a SMILES string representation
of the molecule, which is easily generated using chemical drawing
programs, such as ChemDraw.

The paper is organized as follows.
We first present the computational
methodology including a brief description of the CBH approach. Next,
we discuss the accuracy of the predicted reaction enthalpies as compared
to G4 reference values for the 25 reactions used by Sengupta and Raghavachari1 and perform an error analysis of outliers by
comparing heats of formation (HOF) of the CBH fragments to G4 values.
Finally, we summarize our conclusions and discuss their potential
implications for parameterization of semiempirical methods.

Results
and Discussion
Table 1 shows the
mean unsigned error (MUE) relative to G4-reaction enthalpies for the
parent reaction (Dev-0) and the CBH-1 (Dev-1) and the CBH-2 (Dev-2)
correction schemes. In addition, the maximum absolute error for the
CBH-2 scheme is also listed. As observed in the Sengupta and Raghavachari1 study, CBH-1 correction scheme provides only
a modest improvement in accuracy and for many of the semiempirical
methods, the error actually increases. We will return the source of
the error increase in the next subsection, but for now we will focus
on the accuracy of the CBH-2 results.

a +/– signifies
the uncertainty
associated with MUE.4 Reaction 19 is excluded
for HF-3c, and reaction 23 is excluded for PM6 and PM7. The last column
lists the maximum absolute error for Dev-2.

The MUE of PBEh-3c, which is a dispersion-corrected
hybrid DFT/double-ζ
valence method, is 1.9 kcal/mol, which is very similar to the 1.3–2.1
kcal/mol MUE values obtained by Sengupta and Raghavachari1 for dispersion-corrected DFT functionals using
the much larger 6-311++G(3df,2p) basis set and B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)
geometries and frequencies. This is consistent with Sengupta and Raghavachari1’s observation that the Dev-2 error is
fairly insensitive to basis set size. Similarly, the MUE of HF-3c,
which is a dispersion-corrected HF/minimal basis set method, is 2.4
kcal/mol, which is only 0.3 kcal/mol higher than the value obtained
by Sengupta and Raghavachari1 using HF/6-311++G(3df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p).
The MUE is computed without reaction 19, which is a clear outlier
and will be discussed in detail in the next subsection. For comparison,
the STO-3G MUE is 3.0 kcal/mol, so empirical corrections (most likely
dispersion) contribute to accuracy of the HF-3c method.

GFN-xTB
and DFTB-D3 are the most accurate semiempirical methods
with MUEs of 3.9 and 3.7 kcal/mol, respectively, followed by DFTB
(4.5 kcal/mol) and PM3 (4.8 kcal/mol), with both pairs of methods
being statistically identical (Table S1). The good performance of GFN-xTB and DFTB-D3 is especially remarkable
because they are not specifically parameterized against any reaction
energies. Comparison of the MUEs for DFTB-D3 and DFTB shows that dispersion
corrections lead to noticeably more accurate reaction enthalpies for
DFTB, consistent with previous findings.5 The remaining NDDO-based methods have statistically identical accuracy,
with MUEs in the range of 5.2–5.9 kcal/mol, with the exception
of PM6-D3H+, which has an MUE of 6.5 kcal/mol. The MUEs for PM6, PM6-DH+,
PM6-D3, PM6-D3H4X, and PM7 are computed without reaction 23, which
is a clear outlier and will be discussed in detail in the next subsection.
Furthermore, reactions 16 and 22 are omitted for OM2 because it is
not parameterized for fluorine. We note that PM6-D3H+ has an Dev-2
error of 15.0 kcal/mol and is therefore not considered an outlier.
Although the MUE for PM6-D3H+ is higher than that for the other PM6-based
methods, it does not lead to any outliers using the Dev-2 method.
For the semiempirical methods, there is little correlation between
the MUE for parent reaction and the CBH-2-corrected values. Similarly,
with an MUE of 6.8 kcal/mol, OM2 performs reasonably well for the
parent reactions but worst with CBH-2.

Error Analysis
We start by considering the PM6 result
for the first reaction (R1), where the PM6 error is −0.3 kcal/mol
for the parent reaction and the CBH-1 correction is −12.7 kcal/mol.
PM6 error is quite low for the parent reaction so, ideally, the CBH-1
correction should be close to zero but is in fact quite large in magnitude.
To understand the source of this error, we reformulate the (ΔCBH-n(G4)-ΔCBH-n(LL)) correction in terms
of errors in heats of formation (HOF, ΔHf°).

R1
is a Diels–Alder reaction, where two double bonds are converted
into four single bonds (Figure 1). The CBH-1 reaction is thus 1  and 2  Therefore the CHB-1 correction is 3  where, for example 4   5   6  The errors in the HOFs for
PM6 (and all other
methods) relative to G4 are listed in Table S4 and show that the error in the HOFs relative to G4 are CH4: −5.6, CH2=CH2: −3.3,
and CH3CH3: −4.1 kcal/mol. So, the CBH-1
correction is 4(−4.1) – 2(−3.3) – 4(−5.6)
= 12.6 kcal/mol and the CBH-1 correction is large in magnitude because
the HOF error for CH4 is somewhat larger than that for
CH3CH3 and, especially, CH2=CH2. These errors also show that the low error for the parent
reaction is clearly fortuitous. If the errors in the HOFs of the reactants
and products are similar to those observed for CH4, CH2=CH2, and CH3CH3 then
one would expect an error in the reaction enthalpy of about 3–6
kcal/mol because you go from 2 to 1 molecule.

Figure 1 Three of the 25 reactions
considered in detail in this paper. The
remaining reactions are shown in the Supporting Information (SI).

In contrast, the PBEh-3c error for the parent reaction is
9.0 kcal/mol,
which decreases to −4.5 kcal/mol with the CBH-1 correction.
The error in the HOFs relative to G4 are CH4: 8.5, CH2=CH2: 6.0, and CH3CH3: 14.9 kcal/mol. So the CBH-1 correction is 4(14.9) – 2(6.0)
– 4(8.5) = 13.6 kcal/mol, which when subtracted from 9.9 lowers
the error in reaction energy to −4.5 kcal/mol. Clearly, the
errors in HOFs are much larger than those for PM6, yet most of the
error cancels. The reason is that the magnitude of the HOF error tends
to scale with the number and types of bonds in the molecule for ab
initio methods. For example, the HOF error of CH2=CHCH3 is 13.7 kcal/mol, which is approximately the sum of the HOF
errors of CH3CH3 and CH2=CH2, minus the error for CH4: 14.9 + 6.0 –
8.5 = 12.4 kcal/mol. This type of error scaling makes ab initio results
very amenable to improvement using the CBH approach.

We now
perform similar analysis of the outliers we removed when
computing the Dev-2 MUEs in Table 1, namely, R19 for HF-3c and R23 for PM6, PM6-DH+, and
PM7.

For R23, the PM6, PM6-DH+, and PM7 errors for the parent
reaction
are 0.6, 0.6, and −1.6 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the
Dev-2 errors are 44.8, 45.0, and 45.7 kcal/mol, much larger in magnitude
than other Dev-2 results for these methods. The reaction corresponding
to the CBH-2 correction 7  and the corresponding errors in HOFs
(Table S4) show that the magnitude of the
CBH-2
correction derives from the HOF error of CH2=C=CH2 (7.7 kcal/mol), which is considerably larger than, and opposite
in sign from, the errors in HOF of the remaining fragments (−1.1
to −4.1 kcal/mol).

For R19, the HF-3c Dev-2 error is
−33.5 kcal/mol, much larger
in magnitude than other Dev-2 error for HF-3c. For comparison, the
corresponding value for HF/STO-3G is −12.0 kcal/mol. In R19,
an oxirane ring is formed, which may pose a special challenge to minimal
basis sets that may not offer sufficient flexibility to describe the
ring strain. Indeed, the Dev-2 errors for the first reaction shown
in Figure 2a are −14.6
and −12.6 kcal/mol for HF-3c and HF/STO-3G, respectively. Although
these errors are similar to the HF/STO-3G Dev-2 error for R19, they
are still significantly smaller than the HF-3c Dev-2 error for R19,
so we performed similar calculations for the second reaction shown
in Figure 2a, which
is more similar to R19. The HF-3c and HF/STO-3G errors are −16.4
and −11.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The source of this increased
difference in error between HF-3c and HF/STO-3G can be understood
by decomposing the Dev-2 error into contributions from the two “half-reactions”
(Figure 2c). The HF-3c
and HF/STO-3G Dev-2 errors for the “product reaction”
are very similar (−12.5 and −11.5 kcal/mol), whereas
the HF-3c error is 4.0 kcal/mol higher than that for HF/STO-3G for
the reactant reaction. Thus, the higher Dev-2 error observed HF-3c
is primarily due to a higher error for the reactant. So, one possible
explanation for −33.5 kcal/mol error for HF-3c is that roughly
13 kcal/mol comes from the oxirane ring in the product, whereas the
remaining error comes from the four rings in the reactant (4(4.0)
= 16 kcal/mol).

Figure 2 (a) Two model reactions related to reaction 19. Dev-2
values (in
kcal/mol) are given on the right hand side, and Dev-2 values for the
two half-reactions (shown in (b)), giving rise to the ΔCBH-2
reaction used to compute Dev-2, are at the bottom.

HF-3c differs from HF/STO-3G in several ways: HF-3c
uses the MINIX
basis set instead of STO-3G and has three empirical corrections accounting
for dispersion (Edisp), basis set superposition
error (EBSSE), and bond length errors
(ESRB). These three corrections contribute
1.1 and 4.8 kcal/mol to the errors in the product and reactant half-reactions,
respectively. Thus, the larger error compared to HF/STO-3G for the
product half-reaction is primarily due to the difference in basis
set. This observation is also consistent with the fact that the HF/MINIX
Dev-2 error for the R19 is −24.8 kcal/mol.

Conclusions and
Outlook
The connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) protocol for
computing accurate
reaction enthalpies developed by Sengupta and Raghavachari1 is tested for fast ab initio methods (PBEh-3c,
HF-3c, and HF/STO-3G), tight-binding DFT methods (GFN-xTB and DFTB),
and NDDO-based semiempirical methods (AM1, PM6, PM6-DH+, PM7, and
OM2) using the same set of 25 reactions as in the original study.
As observed by Sengupta and Raghavachari,1 the CBH-1 correction scheme, which reflects the change in bonding,
provides only a modest improvement in accuracy and for many of the
semiempirical methods the error actually increases. For the CBH-2
scheme, which reflects the change in the immediate chemical environment
of all of the heavy atoms, the MUE relative to G4 of PBEh-3c is 1.9
kcal/mol, which is very similar to the 1.3–2.1 kcal/mol MUE
values obtained by Sengupta and Raghavachari1 using various DFT functionals and triple-ζ basis sets. The
MUE for HF-3c, which is a dispersion-corrected HF/minimal basis set
method, is 2.4 and 3.0 kcal/mol for HF/STO-3G. The MUE for HF-3c is
computed without reaction 19, a clear outlier primarily due to a relatively
large error for rings for the HF/MINIX basis set. GFN-xTB is the most
accurate semiempirical method with an MUE of 3.9 kcal/mol, followed
by DFTB (4.5 kcal/mol) and PM3 (4.8 kcal/mol). The remaining NDDO-based
methods, AM1, PM6, PM6-DH+, PM7, and OM2, have statistically equal
accuracy with MUEs in the range of 5.2–5.9 kcal/mol. The MUEs
for PM6, PM6-DH+, and PM7 are computed without reaction 23, which
is a clear outlier due to an unusually large error in the heat of
formation (HOF) compared to G4 for one of the components in the correcting
reaction.

Although the accuracy is lower for the minimal basis
set and semiempirical
methods are lower than for PBEh-3c, they are significantly more computationally
efficient with HF-3c and HF/STO-3G being roughly 10–50 times
faster and the semiempirical methods being roughly 1000 times faster,
depending on system size. It is worth noting that GFN-xTB is roughly
10 times faster than the other semiempirical methods, which can lead
to significant time savings when dealing with thousands of molecules.
However, significant changes in bonding and/or unusual bonding still
present challenge to these faster methods, as evidenced by the presence
of outliers.

More generally, our analyses show that although
the errors in HOF
computed by ab initio and tight-binding DFT methods tend to be larger
in magnitude than those for the NDDO-based semiempirical methods,
the magnitude tends to scale systematically with the number and types
of bonds in the molecule, which make them very amenable to improvement
using the CBH approach. The NDDO-based semiempirical methods are optimized
by reducing the absolute HOF error independent of system size and,
as a result, the HOF error of an individual molecule tends to be relatively
random both in sign and magnitude, which makes it less amenable to
improvement using the CBH approach. A better approach may be to parameterize
the semiempirical methods by minimizing the CBH-corrected error and
presenting the CBH-corrected energies to the user. For example, although
NDDO-based methods would parameterize by minimizing the HOF error
of propane (ΔHOF(propane)), a CBH-1-based scheme would minimize
[ΔHOF(propane) – ΔHOF(ethane) – ΔHOF(methane)]
and present the CBH-1-corrected HOF to the user. This approach might
make it easier to find more generally applicable parameters that better
and systematically minimize the error because the underlying HF approach
“naturally” gives larger errors for larger systems,
and we are no longer asking the parameters to “undo that”
by searching for small errors independent of system size.

We
implemented the CBH-1 and CBH-2 correction schemes in a program
called fragreact, which identifies the appropriate fragments for a
given parent reaction, generates input files for the fragments (if
needed), determines the balanced equation for the correction reaction,
and, in general, automates the entire process.

Computational Details
The connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) protocol has been described
in detail elsewhere1,2 and is only summarized here. The
aim of the method is to approximate the reaction enthalpy of a reaction
(the “parent reaction”) at a high level of theory (here
taken to be G4) by computing the reaction enthalpy using a faster,
lower level method (“LL” in the equations below) and
subtracting a correction. 8  Here, ΔCBH-n(G4) is
the G4-reaction enthalpy computed for a reaction involving smaller
fragments that reflect the change in bonding of the parent reaction
where the size of the fragment is defined by n and
similarly for ΔCBH-n(LL). For ΔCBH-1,
the reaction involves fragments made of two heavy (nonhydrogen) atoms
and reflects the change in bonding, whereas for ΔCBH-2, reaction
involves fragments made from 3 to 5 heavy atoms and reflects the change
in the immediate chemical environment of all of the heavy atoms.

Following Sengupta and Raghavachari,1 we
evaluate the error relative to the parent reaction using G4-reaction
energies as reference. 9   10   11  We use the G4 reference energies
for 25 reactions
from the study of Sengupta and Raghavachari1 (referred to as R1–R25). Note that for R19, R20, and R22,
DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ is used instead of G4.

We implemented
the CBH-1 and CBH-2 correction schemes in a program
called fragreact,6 heavily depending on
RDKit,7 which identifies the appropriate
fragments for a given parent reaction, generates input files for the
fragments (if needed), determines the balanced equation for the correction
reaction, and, in general, automates the entire process.

Although
our fragreact results generally agree with those of Sengupta
and Raghavachari,1 we did obtain slightly
different ΔCBH-2 correction reactions for R18, R19, and R23,
but the effect on the mean unsigned error computed at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)
level of theory is 0.1 kcal/mol, as described in SI. All fragment G4 energies were recomputed as part of this
study.

In this study, we test the accuracy of the CBH-1 and
CBH-2 schemes
for PBEh-3c,8 HF-3c,9 HF/STO-3G,10 GFN-xTB,11 DFTB,12 DFTB-D3,13 AM1,14 PM3,15 PM6,16 PM6-DH+,17 PM6-D3,18 PM6-D3H+,19 PM6-D3H4X,20 PM7,21 and OM2.22,23 In the study of Sengupta
and Raghavachari,1 all results are based
on single-point energy calculations based on structures optimized
with B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and corresponding rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator
enthalpy corrections. We used geometries optimized at the respective
levels, where the geometry optimizations of the parent reaction molecules
are initiated from the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) geometries supplied by Sengupta
and Raghavachari1 (some molecules related
to R2, R5, and R16 were missing and build from scratch). Enthalpy
corrections are not included for the NDDO-based methods because they
are parameterized to reproduce enthalpies of formation. We computed
enthalpies of formation, for analysis purposes, using the method outlined
by Curtiss et al.24 The PBEh-3c and HF-3c
are performed with ORCA,25 the DFTB calculations
with GAMESS,26 the xTB calculations with
the xTB program,11 the OM2 calculations
with MNDO,27 and the remaining NDDO-based
calculations are performed with MOPAC.28
