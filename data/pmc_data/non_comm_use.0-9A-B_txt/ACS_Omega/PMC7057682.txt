Despite the increasing prevalence
of overweight or obesity in the
global population, most of the approved drugs for obesity are still
not ideal for long-term use due to severe cardiovascular and/or neurological
side effects. Therefore, we designed a library-implemented virtual
screening (VS) approach to discover new anti-obesity agents without
significant toxicity. The Bayesian classification and 3D pharmacophore
model for the VS process were built by using the screening results
of our in-house library of natural piper amide-like compounds, which
possess a wide range of biological activities and relatively low toxicities.
The VS process identified six compounds of different classes with
enhanced inhibitory activities against lipid accumulation and without
toxicity. Moreover, the most active compound with an oxadiazole scaffold
resulted in weight loss and improved the fatty liver condition of
mice with overnutrition in animal experiments.

Introduction
Obesity is defined
by the World Health Organization as abnormal
or excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissue.1 This abnormality is one of the most common global health
problems for all age groups. The increase in the prevalence of obesity
threatens individual health by exposure to the risk of associated
complications, including type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
gallbladder disease, and certain types of cancers.2 Accordingly, several pharmacotherapies have been developed
for the prevention or treatment of obesity by targeting a variety
of receptors and enzymes, such as intestinal lipase, 5-HT2C receptor, β3 adrenergic receptor, GLP-1, and many other gut-derived
peptides.3 At present, five drugs are approved
by the FDA for the treatment of obesity: orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate,
bupropion/naltrexone, and liraglutide.4 However, only orlistat and lorcaserin are approved for long-term
use due to the severe adverse effects of the other drugs, such as
cardiovascular and/or neurological side effects.5,6 In
this regard, the development of new anti-obesity agents without adverse
side effects is still highly desirable.

Computer-based virtual
screening (VS) has become a powerful technique
for accelerating the drug discovery process and identifying new classes
of drugs.7,8 A large number of informatics tools and
methods have been utilized for VS and can be classified broadly into
two categories: ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) and structure-based
virtual screening (SBVS).9 LBVS methods
use ligand fragments and patterns from the known structure–activity
data set to select candidates by similarity searching, pharmacophore
mapping, quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR)
modeling, or machine learning methods. On the other hand, SBVS involves
protein–ligand docking with the 3D structural information of
the biological target followed by ranking the ligands based on their
corresponding docking score. Because of the great versatility of VS
approaches, both LBVS and SBVS campaigns have been applied for the
discovery of obesity-related bioactive molecules.10 Several types of hit compounds against 13 obesity-relevant
targets have been identified via LBVS or SBVS campaigns. Nevertheless,
novel VS approaches are still necessary for seeking an unprecedented
class of anti-obesity drugs and targets to cope with the complex molecular
mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of obesity.11

Hence, in this manuscript, we present the library-implemented
discovery
of anti-obesity agents by a combined VS process. For the design of
the VS filters, a natural piper amide-derived in-house library12 and its screening results were utilized. Piper
amide natural products might be a promising resource in the search
for novel anti-obesity agents owing to their broad spectrum of biological
features related to metabolic homeostasis and relatively low toxicities.13 For instance, piper amides from Piper retrofractum Vahl. have been reported to regulate
lipid metabolism-related proteins and reduce weight gain in a high-fat
diet (HFD)-induced mice model.14 Thus,
we envisioned that our in-house library compounds with natural piper
amide scaffolds could be an excellent tool for discovering new anti-obesity
agents because structurally similar compounds tend to have similar
biological activity.15 The presented VS
approach implemented on a natural product-like library provided basis
for finding next-generation weight reducing agents, and further in
vitro and in vivo biological evaluation indicated that compound 6 (PubChem_CID, 6005418) has a great potential as a lead scaffold
for a new class of anti-obesity agents.

Results and Discussion
Screening
a Piper Amide-like Compound Library for Anti-Obesity
Using
the constructed natural piper amide-like compound library,
which featured an α,β-unsaturated amide scaffold,12 the lipid accumulation inhibitory effects of
228 compounds were tested on 3T3-L1 cells at 50 μM. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
have been extensively used in the study of adipocyte differentiation
and lipid production. To rule out false positives and compounds with
cellular toxicity, the cell viability rate was also examined by performing
MTT assays. The resulting lipid reduction data (x axis) were plotted against cell viability (y axis)
as a two-dimensional scatter plot (Figure 1).16 The majority
of the compounds exhibited relatively low toxicity even at a relatively
high concentration of 50 μM, which might result from the natural
product likeness of our library compounds.

and active compound range of Bayesian modeling.
Cell viability and anti-adipogenic effects of 228 compounds were tested
on 3T3-L1 cells at 50 μM. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated
into adipocytes by day 8. Eight active compounds (NED-109, NED-223,
NED-240, NED-241, NED-242, NED-262, NED-275, and NED-278) that were
utilized in 3D pharmacophore modeling are shown as red dots.

Generation of the Bayesian Model
The Bayesian classification
was primarily employed to identify the crucial structural elements
of piper amides that contribute to anti-obesity activity.17 Based on the library screening results shown
in Figure 1, compounds
exhibiting greater than 60% inhibitory activity against lipid accumulation
with cell viability >50% were designated as “active”,
and the rest were designated as “inactive”. All 228
data set molecules were divided randomly into the training set (181
compounds) and test set (47 compounds) by using the random percent
filter (training:test = 80:20). Additionally, the following nine descriptors
were calculated by Pipeline Pilot 201618 and selected to construct a reliable model: AlogP, molecular weight,
number of rotatable bonds, number of rings, number of aromatic rings,
number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors,
molecular fractional polar surface area, and ECFP_6 (extended-connectivity
fingerprints at maximum diameter 6).19 The
constructed model was validated by a leave-one-out cross-validation
process, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve for the score in the training set was found to be 0.838,
indicating the “good” accuracy of the model (the ROC
plots are shown in Figure S1).20 For the test set validation, the best split
was calculated by selecting the split that minimized the sum of the
percentage misclassified category members and nonmembers using the
cross-validated score for each compound. A contingency table (Table 1) was generated containing
the numbers of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), false positives
(FP), and true negatives (TN).

accuracy, Q = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN).

A test set consisting of 47 compounds
was applied to validate the
Bayesian classification model. The ROC score in the test set was 0.992,
which indicates that our model is excellent at distinguishing between
the active and inactive. Furthermore, the calculated sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy for the test set were increased compared
to those of the training set (Table 1). These outcomes demonstrated that the established
classification model has good performance in identifying the vital
fragment present in library compounds with the anti-obesity effects.

Generation of the Field-Based Common Pharmacophore Model
To improve the accuracy of VS, we generated a field-based common
pharmacophore model, which included 3D structural features of ligands.
In this study, we chose the eight active compounds NED-109, NED-223,
NED-240, NED-241, NED-242, NED-262, NED-275, and NED-278 (Figure 2) from the results
of inhibitory activity in lipid accumulation (%) with cell viability
(%) values among all 228 compounds. The 3D conformations of each eight
active compound were generated using FieldTemplater (Forge v.10.3),21 and the conformers of each compounds were populated
using Xedex,22 a component of Forge. Each
conformation was exhaustively compared pairwise until the field point
pattern became common for active compounds as many as possible. After
scoring the 760 generated template models, we selected the best model
by consensus alignment based on the three-dimensional field point
patterns. The selected best model mapped six compounds (NED-240, NED-241,
NED-242, NED-262, NED-275, and NED-278) out of eight active compounds,
and the field and shape similarity scores were 0.746 and 0.832, respectively.
Through analyzing the common field point patterns, we recognize that
the positive and negative electrostatic fields near the amide bond
are mostly consistent because all active compounds share the amide
scaffold. Additionally, hydrophobic fields are prevalent along the
α,β-unsaturated aromatic or heteroaromatic rings of the
active compounds. This indicates that hydrophobic aromatic groups
adjacent to the double bonds are favorable for anti-adipogenic activity.
The additional negative field points surrounding the phenolic moieties
of NED-242, NED-275, and NED-278 are observed only in those three
molecules but possibly correlate with the inhibitory activity. With
this in mind, we performed VS to seek new classes of active compounds.

(NED-223, NED-240, NED-242, NED-262, NED-275, and NED-278) on the
basis of field points. Field-based template models containing a single
conformation of compounds NED-223 (sky blue), NED-240 (pale pink),
NED-242 (purple), NED-262 (pink), NED-275 (lime green), and NED-278
(teal green). Negatively charged field points are shown in blue; positively
charged field points are red; van der Waals/shape field points are
displayed in yellow; centers of hydrophobicity are shown in orange.
Larger field points represent stronger points of potential interaction.

Library-Focused Virtual Screening Combined
Bayesian and Field-Based
Model
To discover new scaffolds for anti-obesity compounds,
we conducted VS based on the generated Bayesian model and 3D field
point patterns. We combined the machine learning model and 3D similarity
search to obtain improved performance by analyzing both 2D and 3D
structural properties of compounds. The steps combined 2D fingerprint
classification using naïve Bayesian and 3D VS using ROCS and
EON procedures, as shown schematically in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic of virtual screening.

As the first step of VS, the chemical library of Korea Chemical
Bank was screened virtually using the Bayesian model. Among the 222,960
molecules, 90,459 compounds were predicted by our 2D classification
model to have anti-obesity effects. Then, the selected compounds were
prepared for the 3D similarity search by performing conformational
energy minimization with Omega v.2.5 in the OpenEye package.23,24 Up to 200 conformers for each molecule were generated for the first
90,459 compounds screened. For these conformers, shape-based similarity
searching and electrostatic potential matching steps were conducted
in a process using ROCS and EON tools based on the obtained conformations
of the six active compounds derived from the field-based pharmacophore
model. As a result of the workflow, the top 100 candidates were chosen
from the large compound database. Additional visual inspection was
carried out to exclude false-positive compounds. Accordingly, 50 candidates
were finally selected for examining anti-adipogenic activity in vitro.

In Vitro Screening for Anti-Obesity Effects of the Selected
Compounds
The 50 virtual hits were experimentally evaluated
for anti-obesity effects. To unambiguously identify the compounds
that exhibited inhibitory activity against lipid accumulation, we
examined the effects of compounds on adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 cells
at 5 μM. As positive controls, resveratrol and one of the most
active natural piper amide derivatives, NED-240, were used. Six compounds
were found to inhibit hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation and
lipid accumulation with similar or higher activity than positive controls
(Figure 4). A notable
feature is that the obtained six compounds exhibited no significant
cellular toxicity. Five selected compounds contain an amide group.
Two of them, 1 and 2, have an α-phenoxyacetamide
moiety, and one compound 3 has an α-thioacetamide.
Amide compound 4 contains a pyrazole ring at the β-position.
Compound 5 is the urea derivative with a benzothiazole
ring. Unlike these compounds, compound 6 does not contain
an amide moiety but does have an oxadiazole moiety.

Figure 4 Assay results and chemical
structures of six active compounds 1–6, NED-240, and resveratrol. Cell viability
and anti-adipogenic effects of compounds were assayed on 3T3-L1 cells
at 5 μM. Three independent experiments were conducted. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, significantly different from the induction
group.

The positive control, NED-240,
showed only weak inhibition of lipid
accumulation at a tested concentration of 5 μM. Compared to
NED-240, the structurally similar compound 2, in which
the p-(tert-butyl)pheny group is
still present, considerably suppressed lipid accumulation. Compound 3 with the α-thioacetamide group also suppressed lipid
accumulation to a similar extent to 2. Interestingly,
oxadiazole 6 showed the most significant inhibition of
lipid accumulation. The IC50 of 6 was 0.6
μM, which is much lower than that of resveratrol (29.8 μM).
Accordingly, further biological evaluation of 6 was performed.

Biological Effect of 6 on Adipogenesis and Lipid
Accumulation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes
The inhibitory activity
of 6 in adipocyte induction from 3T3-L1 cells was also
confirmed in a dose-dependent manner by oil red O staining, as shown
in Figure 5. To understand
the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-adipogenic effect of 6, the expression levels of key transcription factors involved
in adipocyte differentiation and adipogenic genes involved in lipogenesis
and metabolism were analyzed. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR)-γ, which is well known to regulate adipogenesis,
lipid metabolism, and obesity,25 was significantly
inhibited by compound 6 in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 6).26

Figure 5 Effect of compound 6 on adipocyte differentiation
from 3T3-L1 cells. Oil red O staining shows significant inhibition
of lipid accumulation by compound 6.

Figure 6 Effect
of compound 6 on the expression of PPAR-γ
and FAS in adipocytes from 3T3-L1 cells. Protein expression was evaluated
via western blot analysis. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, significantly
different from the induction group.

Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is another central enzyme in lipogenesis,
and thus, the increased expression and/or activity of FAS is related
to the development of various diseases, including obesity.27 Indeed, our western blot analysis also showed
that 6 reduced the expression of FAS in a dose-dependent
manner. These results suggest that oxadiazole 6 exerts
an anti-adipogenic effect by inhibiting the expression of master adipogenic
transcription factor and its target genes. The differentiation of
preadipocytes is regulated by a complex network of multiple transcription
factors to modulate the expression of genes that are responsible for
adipocyte development; thus, further investigation is needed to define
how the expression of PPAR-γ is regulated by compound 6, for example, whether it suppresses the upstream transcription
factors directly or not.

In Vivo Investigation of the Anti-Obesity
Activity of Compound 6
To test the anti-obesity
effect of compound 6, C57BL/6 N mice were fed a normal
chow diet (CD) or HFD
for 12 weeks and then treated with vehicle, compound 6, and resveratrol per os (PO) for 8 days. The anti-obesity effect
of resveratrol is one of its very well-known physiological activities,
which also include anti-oxidative, anticancer, and cardiovascular
protective functions, and resveratrol is thus used as a positive control.28 There was no difference in food intake between
the HFD group and the HFD plus compound 6 or resveratrol
groups (data not shown). However, compound 6-treated
mice showed a significantly decreased body weight that was similar
to that of resveratrol-treated mice compared with the HFD group (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Effect of compound 6 on body weight gain in C57BL/6
N mice fed a HFD. Compound 6 or resveratrol was administered
orally at doses of 20 and 35 mg/kg every day for 8 days. The HFD and
CD control groups were administered a vehicle. Data are presented
as the mean ± SEM (n = 5–7). *p < 0.05, significantly different from the HFD group.

Next, to evaluate the effect of compound 6 on fatty
liver formation by HFD, we examined the liver tissue of each group.
The gross morphology of the livers was enlarged, and a yellowish color
was observed in the livers of mice fed with a HFD, indicating accumulation
of lipids compared with that in the livers of CD control mice. However,
this morphological change was reversed by treatment with compound 6 or resveratrol (Figure 8a). Consistently, the liver weight per body weight
was increased in mice with HFD but was significantly reduced to the
normal level by treatment with compound 6 or resveratrol
(Figure 8b).

(B) Liver weight per body weight was measured. Compound 6 or resveratrol-treated groups were administered orally at doses
of 20 and 35 mg/kg every day for 8 days. The HFD and CD control groups
were administered a vehicle. Data are presented as the mean ±
SEM (n = 5–7). *p < 0.05,
significantly different from the HFD group.

Histological analyses of the liver tissues by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining revealed high accumulation of a microvesicular-type
fat in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes in HFD-fed mice compared with
the lean control mice, which was further confirmed by oil red O staining
(Figure 9). Lean mice
fed with the normal chow diet showed little histological evidence
of fat deposition. Furthermore, the administration of compound 6 or resveratrol for 8 days significantly reduced the accumulation
of fat in hepatocytes compared with that in mice fed with the HFD
alone.

Figure 9 Effects of compound 6 treatment on hepatic steatosis
in HFD mice. H&E and oil red O staining of the liver showed significant
improvement of fatty liver formation by compound 6 and
resveratrol.

Our results clearly showed that
compound 6 exhibited
anti-obesity activity in HFD mice, which is consistent with the anti-adipogenic
effect on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.

Conclusions
In this manuscript, we present an efficient VS protocol implemented
on a natural product-like library that combined 2D and 3D approaches
to discover new chemotypes of anti-obesity agents. We developed multistage
VS on the basis of the biological screening results of our in-house
natural piper amide-like library, which enables the time-efficient
prediction of anti-obesity activity. A total of 222,960 commercially
available compounds were applied to the VS procedure, and 50 compounds
were selected for the biological assay. Among the selected compounds,
several different types of compounds were identified as hit compounds.
They showed similar or higher inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation
in 3T3-L1 cells without significant toxicity than the initial hit
natural piper amide-like molecule, NED-240. The hit rate of the performed
VS was calculated to be 12.0%, which suggested that the integrated
natural product-like library-focused VS protocol was quite reliable
for identifying new promising chemical candidates possessing anti-obesity
activity. Moreover, the most potent compound 6 with a
unique oxadiazole scaffold was validated as a potential anti-obesity
agent through in vitro and in vivo biological investigations. Treatment
with compound 6 led to a significant reduction in body
and liver weight and suppressed fatty liver formation, possibly through
modulating the expression or activity of adipogenic transcription
factors and their downstream target genes involved in adipocyte development
and lipogenesis. We believe that compound 6 discovered
in this work can serve as a lead for anti-obesity drug discovery,
although its mechanism of action (MOA) has not yet been clearly elucidated.
Lead optimization and further pharmacological and pharmacokinetic
study of compound 6 are in progress, and these results
will be reported in due course.

Methods
Chemistry
A set of 228 natural product-like library
compounds was prepared from our previous study,12 and 50 selected compounds from VS were provided by Korea
Chemical Bank. The purity of the compounds was stated by providers
to be ≥95%. The purity of the active compounds was also confirmed
by our laboratory Additionally, the most potent compound 6 was synthesized on a large scale in our laboratory for further biological
evaluations according to the following procedure (Scheme 1). All chemicals were of reagent
grade and used as received. All reactions were performed under an
inert atmosphere under dry nitrogen using distilled dry solvents.
Reactions were monitored by TLC analysis using silica gel 60 F-254
thin-layer chromatography plates. Flash column chromatography was
performed on silica gel (230–400 mesh). Melting points were
measured using a Buchi B-540 melting point apparatus without correction. 1H NMR (300 or 500 MHz) and 13C NMR (125 MHz) spectra
were recorded in δ units relative to the nondeuterated solvent
as the internal reference. IR spectra were measured on a Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded
using fast atom bombardment (FAB).

Computational Details
Data Sets
A set
of 228 compounds and their biological
activities expressed in inhibition of lipid accumulation (%) and CV
(%) rate were selected as a data set to perform classification using
2D descriptors. Among them, the top six bioactive compounds were taken
as a template for 3D shape-based VS. The chemical library database
for VS collected commercially available compounds from Korea Chemical
Bank. The 222,960 compounds were obtained from diverse suppliers,
such as Asinex, ChemBridge, ChemDiv, Enamine, and TimTec. All 2D structures
were prepared using Pipeline Pilot 2016.18

Bayesian Classification
A Bayesian model is an effective
machine learning method to classify active and inactive compounds
using 2D descriptors. A total of 228 biaryl amide analogs experimentally
known for their anti-obesity effects were collected in our previous
study. If a compound had lipid accumulation inhibitory effects greater
than 60% with a CV rate of greater than 50%, then it was defined as
active; other compounds were defined as inactive. The descriptors
used include AlogP, molecular weight, number of aromatic rings, number
of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of hydrogen bond donors, number
of rings, number of rotatable bonds, molecular fractional polar surface
area, and extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFP_6). All data were
split randomly into the training and validation sets using the “Generate
Training and Test Data” protocol implemented in Pipeline Pilot
2016.18 Then, the “Create Bayesian
Model” protocol in Pipeline Pilot was employed to perform the
Laplacian-modified Bayesian analysis to build a model, and a leave-one-out
cross-validation ROC curve was obtained. The good and bad features
of training set compounds present in the biaryl amide analogs play
a crucial role in the anti-obesity effect.

Field-Based Pharmacophore
Alignment
The most active
compounds, NED-109, NED-223, NED-240, NED-241, NED-242, NED-262, NED-275,
and NED-278 were selected to create a potential bioactive conformation
model using the shape and field point from the ligands. The conformations
of each eight compounds were collected to a maximum of 200 structures
using Cresset’s Xedex embedded with Forge. The 3D field point
pattern for each conformations of each eight compounds was calculated
and used to cross-compare to each other using FieldTemplater (conducted
within Forge v.10.3)21 as fraction of score
from a shape similarity set of 0.5, that is, default setting. The
minimum molecules per template set are 5 in this case. The top 3D
field alignment model was selected where the resulting templates included
six compounds among eight compounds. The highly active six compounds
in order by lipid inhibition (%) with CV (%) value were included in
the selection model. The proposed templates each consist of one conformation
of six active compounds, which are NED-223, NED-240, NED-242, NED-262,
NED-275 and NED-278.

Shape- and Electrostatic-Based 3D Virtual
Screening
Rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) can
rapidly calculate
potentially active compounds by shape comparison. The generation of
the low-energy conformers of the 90,459 library compounds, which was
preselected using Bayesian modeling, was performed with OMEGA v.2.524 using default settings, thereby generating a
maximum number of 200 conformers for each molecule. The field- and
shape-based aligned conformer of six bioactive compounds that result
from the FieldTemplater calculation were used as query for the 3D
virtual screening using ROCS v.3.2.31 The
best 1000 hits were screened, considering the ROCS_TanimotoCombo score.
Then, we performed an electrostatic comparison for the screened 1000
compounds using EON v.2.2,32 and the only
top 100 hits were selected by the EON_ET_combo score for each six
query. Duplicate compounds among the results from each query were
removed, and 50 compounds were finally selected for in vitro testing.

Biological Details
Cell Culture
3T3-L1 cells were incubated
using a DMEM
media containing 10% FBS at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 3T3-L1
cells were fully grown in a 48-well plate and treated with a hormone
mixture (10 μg/mL insulin, 0.5 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM
IBMX) for 48 h, and then, the media was changed to DMEM media containing
insulin. Then, the cells were treated with test samples for 8 days,
and the differentiation to adipocytes was observed.

Cell Viability
Measurement
After the completion of
cell differentiation, 0.5 mg/mL MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] was added and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The MTT solution
was eliminated; then, 200 μL of DMSO was added, and the absorbance
was measured at 540 nm for cell viability.

Oil Red O Staining and
Quantification
Upon completion
of cell differentiation, the cells were rinsed with PBS twice and
then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells were incubated with oil
red O dye for 1 h, and microscope images were taken to visualize red
lipid droplets staining in differentiated cells. Isopropanol was added,
and the absorbance was measured at 510 nm for quantification.

Western
Blot Analysis
After lysis, the 3T3-L1 cells
were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was collected,
and the protein was quantified using the Bradford (Bio-Rad, USA) reagent.
Electrophoresis for 30 μg of protein was performed using SDS-PAGE
and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then, blotting
was performed using FAS and the PPAR-γ antibody. Then, they
were reacted with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and detected
using ECL.

Animals and Experimental Design
All mouse work was
performed under an approved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Seoul National University. Five-week-old C57BL/6
N mice, with a body weight of around 20 g, were purchased from Central
Lab Animals Inc. and acclimated for 1 week. All mice were randomly
divided into five groups (n = 7 per group): normal
chow diet (10 kcal% fat) control group, high-fat diet (60 kcal% fat)
control group, and high-fat diet with compound 6 or resveratrol
groups. The compound 6-treated group was treated with
compound 6 at a dose of 20 and 35 mg/kg, and the normal
and high-fat diet control groups were given distilled water. Compound 6 or water was orally administered to the mice for 8 days
by gavage every day. Body weight and daily food intake were measured
every day during the treatment.

Liver Weights and Histological
Examination
The liver
tissues from each mouse were removed and weighed. For histological
analyses, liver tissues were fixed in 10% formalin solution and embedded
in paraffin. Sections of 10 mm thickness were cut, stained with hematoxylin
and eosin, viewed under an optical microscope, and photographed. For
oil red O staining, mouse livers were frozen in an optimal cutting
temperature compound, mounted on slides, and dried for 1–2
h at rt before sectioning. The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and stained in 0.5% oil red O solution in propylene glycol
for 30 min. The slides were rinsed in distilled water and processed
for hematoxylin counter staining.
