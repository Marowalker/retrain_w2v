The
components of isotropic Raman and anisotropic Raman for dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) dispersed in cyclohexane and acetone at different
volume fractions were recorded separately. The noncoincidence effects
(NCE) of the ν7(C=O) stretching mode were
calculated accordingly. The NCE values (ΔνNCE) of the ν7(C=O) versus DMC volume fractions
in the DMC/C6H12 mixtures exhibits a convex
(upward) curvature pattern, while the ΔνNCE vs concentration in the DMC/CH3COCH3 mixtures
exhibits a concave (downward) curvature. These different NCE behaviors
in the different binary mixtures may arise from the solvent-induced
aggregation character. Thus, monomer and dimer structures of DMC were
optimized and the vibration spectra were obtained using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. An aggregation model was suggested to expound
the DMC’s characteristic NCE behavior and concentration effect.
We found that the theoretical spectra from DFT/polarizable continuum
model calculation based on the aggregation model is in accordance
with our experimental data. Solvent-dependent experiments show the
ΔνNCE values increase with the decrease of
the solvent dielectric constant under the identical volume fractions.

Introduction
Most of the reactions
take place in the liquid phase in the form
of mixtures, and various molecular interactions like solute–solute,
solute–solvent, and solvent–solvent interactions are
present in the solution.1−3 The competition between these
interactions plays a crucial role in determining ground-state and
transition-state structures,4−6 reaction pathway and kinetics,
activation energy, etc..5−7 For a binary solute–solvent
solution, the dilution process of the solution results in three effects,
i.e., breaking of the solute aggregation structure,8,9 changes
of concentration fluctuation applicable solution theory, and modification
of the local chemical composition.10 These
effects can be efficiently traced by the polarized Raman spectra (i.e.,
isotropic and anisotropic Raman spectra) of the specific vibrational
mode.9,11−13 The phenomenon of the
noncoincidence frequency of the same vibrational mode between isotropic
and anisotropic Raman spectra was named as the noncoincidence effect
(NCE).13,14 The analysis of aggregation complexes in
the presence of the solvent interactions has been discussed by the
dilution process of solution; changes take place in the aggregation
behavior of the solute, i.e., it may either make or break, according
to the Raman NCE behavior.13,14 By Raman NCE behavior
measurements, the molecular interactions in pure liquids (solute–solute
interaction), solutions (solute–solvent interaction), and mixtures
(solute–another solute interaction) have been studied.15−19 It is a useful and reliable tool to study the properties of solutions
of ketone,9,14,17,20,21 amines,17 alcohols22−24 etc.

Vibration spectra
are a useful index to intermolecular interactions.25 Concentration effects and solvent effects mainly
reflect in frequency shifts,22−24 changes in absolute Raman cross
section,11 vibrational line full width
at half-maximum,3 and the value of noncoincidence
effects.13,14 Of course, solvents can also cause more
profound effects, such as solubility, equilibrium geometry structure,
and aggregation behavior in their ground state.26 In this paper, we report the intermolecular interaction
between solute–solute C=O vibration coupling and solute–solvent
interaction of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and their competition behavior
in different concentrations or in various solvents by Raman spectroscopy.
Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the
isotropic and anisotropic Raman spectra assignment, we know that the
interactions that are taking place between dimethyl carbonate and
the solvent mainly come from the C=O group of dimethyl carbonate.
Experiments show that the NCE of C=O stretch mode is a particularly
meaningful index to intermolecular interactions, including transition
dipole–transition dipole coupling (TD–TD) and van der
Waals force, and demonstrate that isotropic Raman and anisotropic
Raman spectroscopy techniques provide dynamic molecular pictures of
the competition between solute–solute and solute–solvent
interactions with different concentrations and different solvents.

Results
and Discussion
The vibrational spectra have been calculated
for DMC using DFT
to assign and describe the molecular spectra obtained by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) and FT-Raman. Figure 1 shows the comparison among the FT-IR, FT-Raman, and
micro-Raman spectra. Table 1 displays the DFT calculated vibrational wavenumbers with
B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d,p) basis set, corresponding to the experimental
vibrational frequencies obtained by FT-Raman and FT-IR accordingly.
The corresponding data between the DFT calculated vibrational frequencies
and the experimental vibrational frequencies is in good agreement.
The dashed lines in Figure 1 illustrate the correlation of the vibrational frequencies
in FT-IR to the corresponding frequencies in FT-Raman and micro-Raman,
respectively. The noticeable frequency difference (17 cm–1 frequency difference) of the C=O stretch mode obtained from
the FT-Raman spectrum and FT-IR measurements is one key character
of the noncoincidence effect. The C=O vibration TD–TD
interaction may account for this noncoincidence effect. The TD–TD
interaction organized the DMC in a short- or long-range orientation
order; we proposed one aggregated dimer model, and the corresponding
DFT calculations based on the DMC monomer and the proposed dimer structure
had been carried out to manifest the rationality of the model. The
comparison between these data and the isotropic and anisotropic Raman
spectra at different concentrations will be discussed later.

Full conformational optimization
for the DMC was performed to establish
the most stable molecule structure as the initial geometry for further
calculations. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) solvent model
at the B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d,p) level of theory was applied to calculate
the vibrational spectra of the DMC monomer and dimer dispersed in
C6H12. Figure 2 demonstrates the calculated most stable structures
of the monomer and dimer of DMC. The dimer geometry adopted a face-to-face,
head-to-tail antiparallel pattern with intermolecular weak interaction.
The as-calculated theoretical vibrational frequencies, their corresponding
depolarization ratios, the assignment of experimental Raman and IR
spectra, and the ZPE-corrected total energy of the monomer and dimer
are given in Table 1. TD–TD interactions drive molecules to reorientate their
alignment, reduce the molecular potential energy, and gain the most
stable conformation. From Table 1 and Figure 2, we observe that the TD–TD coupling of two neighbor
C=O stretching modes from the dimer differentiates the interaction
in two ways. One interaction is synchronous and the second is asynchronous,
which leads to a discrepancy in the C=O vibrational frequency
and depolarization ratio. The synchronous C=O stretching frequency
lies below the asynchronous one.

Figure 2 B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d,p) computed geometry
of DMC and its aggregates.

The DMC dimer has 24 atoms and produces 66 normal modes of
vibration,
in which 60 normal modes arise from the synchronous and asynchronous
coupling between these two neighbor molecules and 6 normal modes come
from the relative translation and rotation of these two neighbor molecules.
The assignment and description of the experimental Raman and IR frequencies
for monomer and dimer structures are listed in Table 1. Synchronous and asynchronous vibration
patterns produce differences in vibrational wavenumbers; the value
of these differences depend on the strength of interaction between
neighbor molecules. The intermolecular interactions between different
parts of the neighbor molecules have different strengths. The computed
frequencies in Table 1 show that the intermolecular coupling in the dimer structure breaks
the degeneracy of the individual vibrational level; however, only
few interaction pairs split distinctly. These splits may still beyond
the Raman resolution limits. Thanks to the prominent difference in
the depolarization ratio of coupled C=O stretching pairs, we
can take advantage of these differences to preferentially collect
parallel and perpendicular polarized Raman spectra separately. With
the parallel and perpendicular polarized Raman spectra, we can get
the isotropic and anisotropic components of Raman spectra using the
equation.27    where IVV(v) and IVH(v) are experimentally collected Raman
intensities of the polarized
and depolarized Raman components, respectively, and v is the frequency in cm–1. For the detailed meaning
of VV and VH, please see the Experimental and Computational
Methods section.

Due to the significant difference in
the depolarization ratio (ρ),
this collected parallel or perpendicular polarized spectra preferentially
get the relative small ρ component or large ρ of the C=O
stretching pairs, respectively; these two ρ components for the
C=O stretching pairs have different frequencies and, thus,
present the noncoincidence effects of these two components, that is
the so-called NCE phenomenon. In other words, only the interaction
pairs with a distinct difference simultaneously in the vibrational
frequency and depolarization ratio present the NCE phenomenon. By
screening the DFT computed data in Table 1, only C=O vibration mode satisfies
these terms. Figure 3 shows the isotropic and anisotropic components of Raman spectra
of DMC for ν7(C=O) vibration. The isotropic
component frequency at 1750.2 cm–1 was ascribed
to the computed frequency at 1793 cm–1. The anisotropic
component at 1754.5 cm–1 was assigned to the calculated
frequency at 1815 cm–1. Their corresponding depolarization
ratios are 0.12 and 0.30. The frequencies calculated using the dimer
model are consistent with the experimentally observed isotropic Raman
and anisotropic Raman spectra.

0.600, 0.500, and 0.400 in the binary mixture (DMC + C6H12).

Noncoincidence effects
always come with the concentration effect. Figure 3 illustrates the
polarized Raman spectra (isotropic and anisotropic parts) of DMC at
various volume fractions in the DMC/C6H12 mixture.
It demonstrates that when the DMC concentration decreases, both of
the polarized Raman frequencies of C=O stretch, including the
isotropic and anisotropic Raman frequencies, increase. The NCE value
(that is, ΔνNCE = νaniso –
νiso) is 4.3 cm–1 for DMC, while
it reduces to 1.9 cm–1 for DMC at ΦA = 0.4 in the DMC/C6H12 mixture. To explore
the relationship between the changes in the frequency and the volume
fraction, both the C=O stretching frequencies of the isotropic
and anisotropic Raman spectra in six volume fractions, 0.900, 0.800,
0.700, 0.600, 0.500, 0.400 in the binary mixture (DMC + C6H12), as well as in pure DMC are abstracted from Figure 3, which were drawn
as a function of concentration, as shown in Figure 4. The ΔνNCE will eventually
becomes 0 at an extreme concentration ΦA. The Raman
frequencies of both components increase with the decrease of solute
concentrations. Especially, the isotropic ν7(C=O)
frequencies for neat DMC and ΦA (DMC in C6H12) of 0.400 are 1750.2 and 1754.0 cm–1, respectively. That is to say, the wavenumbers of isotropic C=O
stretching blue-shifted by 3.8 cm–1 from the highest
to the lowest concentration of DMC, while other vibrational bands
remain the same. The NCE value, that is, ΔνNCE = νaniso – νiso, can be
calculated from Figure 4 and is plotted with volume fractions in C6H12, as shown in Figure 5. The ΔνNCE for the C=O stretching
mode decreases upon dilution with C6H12 from
4.30 cm–1 in neat DMC to 1.90 cm–1 at ΦA (DMC in C6H12) of 0.400.
The change of ΔνNCE with dilution is due to
the decrease in the TD–TD interaction. For the variation of
isotropic and anisotropic Raman peak frequencies of C=O stretching
mode with volume fractions from 0.1 to 1, see the Supporting Information, S1.

Raman peak frequencies of
the C=O stretching mode of DMC as a function of solute volume
fractions (DMC + C6H12).

Figure 5 Variation of NCE of C=O stretching mode of DMC as a function
of solute volume fractions (DMC + C6H12).

The noncoincidence phenomenon
between isotropic and anisotropic
Raman spectra of the C=O mode in DMC implies that there may
exist C=O coupling that degenerated the C=O vibration
frequency by dipole–dipole interactions. Dipole–dipole
coupling inclines to array the molecules to lower its total energy.
During the dilution process, the emergence of a large number of solvent
molecules isolate the reference molecules and weaken the dipole–dipole
interaction, till the C=O coupling between the solute molecules
breaks. In consideration of the low energy barrier (75.46 kJ/mol)
between the DMC monomer and dimer from DFT calculations, it is easy
to transform from dimer to monomer, and vice versa. During the dilution
process, the DMC-aggregated dimer structure gradually separates and
breaks into monomers; accordingly, the pattern of Raman spectra gradually
switches from the dimer feature to the monomer feature. By scrutinizing
the calculated frequencies for dimers in Table 1, only ν7(C=O) coupling
pairs present distinct vibrational frequency difference; moreover,
their vibration frequencies (1815/1793 cm–1) are
all lower than that of the monomer (1825 cm–1).
These computed results are in accordance with the experimental data
that we observed in Figure 3, that is, the frequency of C=O stretching blue-shifted
upon the dilution process (dimer transforms to monomers) and simultaneously
the peak sharpens and become symmetric. The value of ΔνNCE gets smaller and smaller upon dilution.

Until now,
all positive and negative ΔνNCE cases have
been reported, which depend on the orientation of the
dipoles by TD–TD interactions. For the case of DMC, the ΔνNCE is positive and it takes on the antiparallel side-by-side
interaction of the intermolecular C=O dipoles, which is shown
in Figure 2. It is
well known that the NCE phenomenon is a spectroscopic manifestation
of the existence of the resonant intermolecular dipole–dipole
coupling by the TD–TD interaction.28,29 This coupling results in the degeneration in energy of resonant
dipole oscillators by assuming a short-range orientational order.21,28,30 The property and value of ΔνNCE depend on the pattern of short-range orientation and the
strength of the TD–TD interaction. The Born–Oppenheimer
approximation and all quantum chemistry state that the electric dipole
moment remains constant at different concentrations. However, the
fluctuation of the concentration of the reference molecules changes
the relative alignment of the coupling dipoles. The decrease of the
concentration leads to a weakening of the coupling between resonant
dipole oscillators and results in the decrease of the value of ΔνNCE.

To investigate the dependence of NCE behavior on
the solvents properties,
especially on polarity of the solvents, the NCE measurements were
extended to polar solvents such as CH3COCH3 and
a thorough comparison was made between these two different polarity
solvent data.

Similarly, we carried out the concentration dependence
experiments
also. The measured νiso and νaniso components of the C=O stretching mode vs volume fractions
in DMC/CH3COCH3 mixtures are plotted and shown
in Figure 6. From this,
we learn that the νiso of C=O stretching (isotropic
Raman frequency) increases with the dilution of DMC in DMC/CH3COCH3 mixtures, whereas the νaniso component decreases with the dilution of DMC. The fitted curve of
DMC in DMC/CH3COCH3 mixtures displays a downward
(concave) curvature feature, contrary to the upward (convex) fitted
curve obtained for nonpolar solvents, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 6 Concentration dependence
of the isotropic and anisotropic Raman
frequencies for the ν7(C=O) stretching mode
of DMC in the binary mixture (DMC + CH3COCH3).

By drawing the values of νiso and νaniso components of C=O stretching,
shown in Figure 6,
we can calculate
the ΔνNCE values, which are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 clearly shows that the fitted
curve of ΔνNCE vs volume fractions in DMC/CH3COCH3 mixtures presents a downward (concave) curvature
feature. On the contrary, as shown in Figure 5, the upward (convex) curvature was obtained
for the relationship of ΔνNCE vs volume fractions
in DMC/C6H12 mixtures. These results are the
same as the rule found for acetone.31 Moreover,
this rule has been manifested by further MD simulations. They ascribed
the phenomenon to the decrease (or the increase) of the pair alignment
in the acetone/DMSO (or acetone/CCl4) mixtures. When εsolute > εsolvent, a convex curvature of
ΔνNCE with respect to the solute volume fraction
was observed,
whereas a concave curvature was observed for the case of εsolute < εsolvent. Similarly in our study,
because εDMC > εC6H12, a upward (convex) curvature was obtained for the
ΔνNCE in the DMC/C6H12 mixtures, whereas
a concave curvature was obtained for the ΔνNCE in the DMC/CH3COCH3 mixtures. Thus, a similar
conclusion can be drawn that the decrease (or the increase) of the
dimer structure of DMC in the DMC/CH3COCH3 (or
DMC/C6H12) mixture may account for the shift
of peak frequencies.

Figure 7 Concentration dependence of the NCE of C=O stretching
mode
of DMC in the binary mixture (DMC + CH3COCH3).

Figures 5 and 7 show that the
character of ΔνNCE behavior largely depends
on the relative dipole moment of the solute
to the solvent. To further know the effect of dipole moment on ΔνNCE, a series of solvents with different static dielectric
constants were chosen to prepare the same concentration of DMC (ΦA = 0.5) and their isotropic and anisotropic Raman spectra
of DMC (ΦA = 0.5) were collected, as shown in Figure 8. The ΔυNCE vs ΦA is illustrated in Figure 9, which shows that under the
same volume fraction the ΔυNCE increases with
the decrease of the solvent dielectric constant, which is in good
agreement with Logan’s theory.32 Within this theory, the character shown in Figure 10 could be expected, that is, a downward
(convex) curvature for a lower-polarity solvent and an upward (concave)
curvature for a higher-polarity solvent.

To get further evidence on this
property rule and strengthen the
rationality of the dimer model, DFT calculations in association with
the polarizable continuum model (PCM) at the hybrid B3LYP-D3 levels
of theory with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set have been carried out to
obtain the DMC dimer structure using the Gaussian 09 program. The
results are shown in Table 2, wherein the C=O vibrational frequencies, the corresponding
depolarization ratios, and the ΔυNCE of DMC
in a variety of solvents are listed in detail. The calculations show
that with the decrease of the solvent dielectric constant the ΔυNCE increases. This result is based on our proposed dimer model
and is consistent with the conclusion drawn from Figure 9, which further manifests the
rationality of our proposed dimer model.

In an extremely
diluted solution, the ΔυNCE will vanish; this
is independent from the solvent. In sum, our solvent-dependent
experiment shows that, in a given concentration, the value of NCE
increases with the decrease of the solvent dielectric constant. By
extending this rule to the whole concentration, a upward (convex)
fitted curve for a lower-polarity solvent and a downward (concave)
fitted curve for a higher-polarity solvent could be expected, which
conform to the conclusion reported by many scientists.31,33−35

All our experimental spectra and dimer model-based
computational
calculations show a satisfactory relationship between the NCE character
and the resonant dipolar coupling as well as the solute to solvent
polarity in mixtures at molecular resolution.

Conclusions
Experimental
Raman and IR spectroscopy techniques in association
with DFT/PCM calculations have been applied to investigate the NCE
phenomenon of the ν(C=O) band of DMC in the liquid mixture.
The ΔνNCE of the νC=O stretching vs volume fraction exhibits a downward (concave) fitted
curve and an upward (convex) fitted curve in the DMC/CH3COCH3 and DMC/C6H12 mixtures, respectively.
The order of the dielectric constant accounts for this phenomenon,
εCH3COCH3 > εDMC > εC6H12, a solvent
having
a larger dielectric constant can easily destroy the aggregate structure
(short-range dimer structure) of DMC in the mixtures. To explain this
phenomenon, a dimer model was proposed and the vibrational frequencies
have been computed for both the monomer and dimer; NCE concentration
effects can be explained by the transformation between dimer and monomer
forms. During the dilution process, the DMC gradually transformed
from a dimer form to a monomer form, corresponding to the blue shift
of the ν7(C=O) vibrational frequencies. The
solvent-dependent properties of the NCE phenomenon can also been explained
using the dimer model. The experiment shows that the ΔνNCE increases with the decrease of the solvent dielectric constant.
The DFT calculations based on the dimer model give a consistent picture
with the experimental results. Our dimer model provides a satisfactory
explanation of the NCE phenomenon, concentration dependence properties,
and solvent dependence properties.

Experimental and Computational
Methods
The experimental setup of Raman spectroscopy has
been reported
in the literature with modifications.9,36 Briefly, the
experimental apparatus consists of a triple monochromator (TriVista
TR557, Princeton Instruments) equipped with an argon ion laser (Coherent,
CVI MELLES GRIOT) as a source of excitation light at 488 nm (75 mW
output) and with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD array (Princeton Instruments
Inc.) allowing a wavenumber coverage of 1089 cm–1 and a spectral resolution (the instrumental apparatus function,
FWHM) of 2.0 cm–1. The accuracy in the measurement
(the physical matrix pixel of the CCD camera) of the band positions
was 0.45 cm–1. Raman spectra were collected for
DMC at the concentration ranging from 40 to 100% in the DMC/C6H12 mixture. A 488 nm laser was used to produce
the Raman scattering signals, and a backscattering geometry was applied
to collect the Raman-scattered light. The polarized Raman measurements
were carried out using a polarizer and an analyzer in the VV and VH
polarization configurations. First, using a polarizer by vertically
(V) polarizing the exciting laser and then using an analyzer by alternatively
selecting the vertically (V) or horizontally (H) to the polarizer
to collect the VV or VH Raman-scattered signal. The experiments are
carried out with identical environment conditions at room temperature
(298 K) and atmospheric pressure. The obtained Raman frequencies were
plotted and fitted with the polynomial equation y = intercept + ax + bx2.

The FT-IR spectra were obtained with 2 cm–1 resolution
using an FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet avatar 370, Thermo Fisher
Nicolet). The FT-Raman spectra were obtained with an FT-Raman spectrometer
at 1064 nm excitation (Thermo Nicolet 960, Thermo Fisher Nicolet).

Computational density functional theory (DFT) helps to better understand
the characteristic thermally stable structure of the molecule. Herein,
DFT calculations at the B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d,p) level of theory were
carried out to optimize the structure and for the calculation of vibrational
frequencies. DFT calculations are based on a Gaussian program.37
