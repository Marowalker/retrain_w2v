Smartphone-based
fluorescence microscopy has been rapidly developing
over the last few years, enabling point-of-need detection of cells,
bacteria, viruses, and biomarkers. These mobile microscopy devices
are cost-effective, field-portable, and easy to use, and benefit from
economies of scale. Recent developments in smartphone camera technology
have improved their performance, getting closer to that of lab microscopes.
Here, we report the use of DNA origami nanobeads with predefined numbers
of fluorophores to quantify the sensitivity of a smartphone-based
fluorescence microscope in terms of the minimum number of detectable
molecules per diffraction-limited spot. With the brightness of a single
dye molecule as a reference, we compare the performance of color and
monochrome sensors embedded in state-of-the-art smartphones. Our results
show that the monochrome sensor of a smartphone can achieve better
sensitivity, with a detection limit of ∼10 fluorophores per
spot. The use of DNA origami nanobeads to quantify the minimum number
of detectable molecules of a sensor is broadly applicable to evaluate
the sensitivity of various optical instruments.

Introduction
To fulfill the demand
for point-of-need diagnostic devices in global
healthcare, various portable and miniature optical-imaging devices
have been developed.1−9 Point-of-need diagnostics requires robust and easy-to-use handling
as well as sensitive and specific detection with cost-effective equipment.
Smartphones are appealing for such devices10 as they benefit from economies of scale, where it is estimated that
the current number of smartphone users is close to a third of the
world’s population,11 surpassing
the number of digital camera users with digital camera sales reducing
every year.12 This massive market drives
the development of the smartphone camera and computing technologies
and enables the low-cost mass production of its components. As an
example, the whole camera system of a state-of-the-art smartphone
including the optical components and image sensor is commercially
available for less than 20 USD. An additional advantage is that smartphones
can not only be used for digital image recording, processing, and
on-the-spot analysis but also for electronic medical recording and
communication. Recently, portable smartphone-based fluorescence microscopes
(SBFMs) enabled food-allergen testing,13 blood analysis,14 as well as the detection
of single particles,15 cells,14 bacteria,16 and biomarkers13,17 including proteins18 and nucleic acids.19,20 In addition, the diagnosis of infectious diseases was demonstrated
in developing countries.21−25 Although SBFMs are relatively easy to configure to create a low-cost
and field-portable microscope design,10 they exhibit limited detection sensitivity compared with laboratory-based
fluorescence microscopes, which can routinely detect single-molecule
fluorescence. Such a high sensitivity is crucial for an early disease
detection as extremely low concentrations of few molecules per milliliter
have to be detected.26 To date, the fluorescence
detection limit of SBFM designs under low-light conditions has not
been comprehensively characterized. Recent studies using SBFMs revealed
that isolated nano-objects with several hundreds to thousands of fluorophores
per diffraction-limited spot could be detected.15,19 A higher sensitivity, reaching a detection limit of 80 fluorophores
per spot, was also achieved using plasmonic enhancement as a part
of the sample substrate.27

In this
study, we quantify the detection sensitivity of color and
monochrome sensors embedded in smartphones used as a part of an SBFM.
Comparing the imaging performance of cameras including parameters
such as quantum efficiency, dark noise, and saturation capacity is
usually complex. Under low-light conditions, we use the minimum number
of detectable molecules as a central parameter to characterize and
compare the sensitivity of SBFMs. Tracing back the number of detectable
molecules per spot has become possible with the advent of DNA origami
brightness reference samples that show a linear dependence of fluorescence
intensity on the number of fluorophores.28,29 For this purpose, we employed 5 DNA origami nanobead samples with
predefined numbers of fluorophores ranging from approximately 10 to
74 green fluorescent dyes (ATTO542) per nanobead. The choice of this
green fluorescent dye is intended to match the spectral range in which
both monochrome and color sensors embedded in smartphones exhibit
the highest detection sensitivity. We immobilized the samples on glass
coverslips with an average density of less than one structure per
diffraction-limited spot and imaged them using SBFMs. The obtained
smartphone images were compared with the images taken with a specialized
single-molecule wide-field fluorescence microscope (sm-microscope).
Finally, the sensitivity was quantified by calculating the Weber contrast
as CW = (I – IB)/IB, with I and IB representing the fluorescence
and background intensities, respectively. Our results show that, for
smartphone camera modules, monochrome sensors outperform color sensors
for fluorescence detection and can reach a detection limit of 10 fluorophores
per diffraction-limited spot with a mean Weber contrast of 0.2.

Results
The SBFMs used in this work (Figures 1 and SI1) are
based on a previous design.15 It incorporates
only the basic optical elements to function as a fluorescence microscope:
a light source (532 nm continuous wave (cw)-laser), excitation and
emission filters, two mirrors, two lenses (one for focusing the excitation
beam and another for collecting the fluorescence), and a smartphone
camera as the image detector. The excitation occurs in a dark-field
geometry directing the laser beam at a 45° illumination angle
to avoid collection of the directly transmitted beam by the SBFM (Figure 1b). A bandpass filter
is used to spectrally reject the scattered light from the cw-laser
so that only fluorescence light is detected. Samples are mounted on
an xyz-micrometer stage for focusing and sample adjustment. We employed
two different smartphones for our SBFM measurements: the LG V10 and
the Huawei P10 Plus. The choice of smartphone was intended to maximize
the image quality in terms of the light captured and resolution. Therefore,
we focused on smartphones with the highest numerical aperture and
biggest sensor. The LG V10 contains a single back-camera with an aperture
of f/1.8 and a color 16 MP sensor (5312 × 2988
pixel) with a size of 5.96 mm × 3.35 mm leading to a pixel size
of approximately 1.12 μm. The monochrome camera of the Huawei
phone has comparable specifications, the same aperture of f/1.8 and a 20 MP sensor (5120 × 3840), with a size
of 5.12 mm × 3.840 mm leading to a pixel size of 1 μm.
To ensure that the same regions of the sample are imaged with different
microscopes, grid marks were used (Figure S2).

Figure 1 Sketch of our experimental setup for SBFM.

Calibration of DNA Origami Nanobeads
The five different
DNA origami nanobead samples (i.e., samples A, B, C, D, and E, as
obtained from GATTAquant GmbH) were surface immobilized in a flow
cell and characterized with a confocal fluorescence microscope to
determine the average number of fluorophores per nanobead in each
sample. Through a fluorescence intensity comparison with samples,
each containing a single fluorophore, the average numbers of fluorophores
in samples A, B, C, D, and E were measured as 74 ± 14, 49 ±
13, 34 ± 7, 16 ± 5, and 10 ± 5, respectively (see Figure S3). Furthermore, the intensity distributions
reveal that only single fluorescence beads are attached to the surface
(within a diffraction-limited area) with only a small dimer fraction
visible for the nanobeads with a higher loading (Figure S3).

Color versus Monochrome Image Sensor Performance
After
calibration of the DNA origami nanobeads, we focused on a comparison
of the monochrome and color sensor performance. Therefore, the same
area on sample A (74 dye molecules) was imaged with both smartphones
and an sm-microscope. The results (Figure 2a–c) show that sample A can be imaged
by all three microscopes as evidenced by the strong correlation of
spots in all images. As expected, the images obtained with the sm-microscope
exhibit fluorescence spots with a smaller size because of its higher
numerical aperture. Furthermore, images taken with the monochrome
sensor show a higher contrast compared with the color camera (as also
shown by the line intensity profiles across the same spot in Figure 2d–f). Weber
contrasts for the spots marked in Figure 2 were calculated as 3.37 for (a), 0.15 for
(b), and 0.39 for (c). It is worth mentioning that sample A was first
imaged with the color SBFM, followed by the monochrome SBFM, and finally
with the sm-microscope. Therefore, potential bleaching of some of
the fluorophores of each bead in sample A cannot account for the worse
contrast of the color sensor image. We suggest that this is mainly
caused by differences in the light collection efficiency of the smartphone
camera sensors. The color sensor is composed of a Bayer filter30 in which out of four pixels, two have green
filters, whereas the remaining two have a red and a blue filter, respectively,
to generate a color image. In contrast, monochrome sensors have no
color filters and therefore every pixel can collect light in the green
spectral range as opposed to only half the overall number of pixels
in a color sensor. Based on these results, we selected the monochrome
smartphone imager sensor for further SBFM experiments.

Figure 2 Image comparison between
sm-microscope and SBFM. Sample A imaged
with (a) the sm-microscope, (b) the LG color SBFM, and (c) Huawei
monochrome SBFM. Scale bar in (a) applies also to images (b) and (c).
(d–f) represent a horizontal-line intensity profile of the
marked spots in (a)–(c), respectively.

Sensitivity Determination of Monochrome Image Sensors
Next,
we set out to determine the sensitivity limit of the monochrome
SBFM with the fluorescent nanobeads. First, all the samples (A, B,
C, D, and E) were imaged on the monochrome SBFM (see Figure 3k–o respectively). For
visibility, these images were tonal corrected in Adobe Photoshop as
only jpeg files could be exported from the smartphone. The same area
was later imaged on the sm-microscope to verify that the detected
spots represent single nanobeads (see Figure 3a–e). These images (Figure 3a–e,k–o) reveal
decreasing brightness from sample A (74 fluorophores) to sample E
(10 fluorophores) as they are adjusted to the same brightness scale,
respectively. Samples A and B (74 and 49 fluorophores, respectively)
yield similar bright and sharp images when imaged with the monochrome
SBFM (Figure 3p,q).
In contrast, for sample E (10 fluorophores), beads are barely detectable
under the SBFM (Figure 3o). Samples containing a single fluorophore were also imaged with
the SBFM, but no spots could be identified (Figure S4). For better identification of spots and to improve visualization,
the images shown in Figure 3a–e were rescaled with the brightest pixel set to the
highest brightness value resulting in Figure 3f–j. Figure 3k–o were brightness and contrast adjusted
leading to Figure 3p–t.

Figure 3 Images of samples A–E taken with the sm-microscope
(a–j)
and the monochrome SBFM (k–t). (a–e) and (k–o)
reveal a decrease in brightness as the images are adjusted to the
same scale, respectively. For a simplified identification of single
nanobeads, images (f)–(j) were rescaled to the highest brightness
value and images (p)–(t) were rescaled for brightness and contrast.
Images (k)–(o) were tonal corrected to the same value for better
visibility. The scale bar in (a) is applicable to all images.

To compare the image quality,
we calculated the Weber contrast
for each spot from the uncorrected SBFM images (see Materials and Methods). A signal-to-noise ratio analysis based
on the standard deviation of the background signal could not be performed
since images could only be saved in the jpeg format, which smoothens
the background noise significantly. Figure 4 shows histogram plots of the Weber contrast
for each sample and Gaussian fits to the distributions. The Weber
contrast decreases from values of 0.66 ± 0.17 for the bright
samples to 0.20 ± 0.08 for the 10-dye sample E. As the Weber
contrast exhibits an expected strong power-density dependence (Figure S5), imperfect alignment with small variations
of excitation intensity contribute to the error in determining the
Weber contrast.

Figure 4 Distribution of the Weber contrast values (CW) for samples A–E. Gaussian fitting yields the
mean
Weber contrast with its standard deviation.

Finally, we estimate the monochrome SBFM detection limit
to be
around 10 fluorophores. This assessment is based on the fact that,
for sample E, single spots are barely detectable in both the original
image and the contrast-enhanced image (Figure 3o,t). In addition, not all spots present
on the sm-microscope image (Figure 3e) can be identified on their SFBM image counterparts
(see circles in Figure S6) although SFBM
imaging was conducted first to rule out any influence of photobleaching.

Discussion
In conclusion, we employed DNA-origami nanobeads
with predefined
numbers of independently emitting fluorophores to quantitatively study
the detection limit of SBFMs. Our results show that state-of-the-art
smartphones with monochrome sensors exhibit a higher sensitivity and
are thus better suited for fluorescence sensing and imaging applications,
reaching a detection limit of ∼10 fluorescent dyes per diffraction-limited
spot. Further developments in smartphone sensors or the combination
with optical antennas will soon bridge the gap to democratize single-molecule
detection with smartphone microscopes.31−35 Using DNA nanobeads, we introduced the minimal number
of detectable molecules as a simple parameter for precise quantification
of SBFMs, paving the way for the development of diagnostic assays
for point-of-need devices that fully exploit the potential and capabilities
of smartphone-based instrumentations.

Materials and Methods
Sample
Preparation
Custom-built fluorescence beads
(samples A, B, C, D, and E) functionalized with a decreasing number
of ATTO542 fluorescent dye molecules were purchased from GATTAquant
GmbH (Hiltpoltstein, Germany). Folding of DNA origami pillars incorporating
a single ATTO542 fluorophore is described elsewhere.36 Samples were prepared as simple flow cells from a cover
slide and a microscope slide (see Figure S2). The different fluorescence beads were surface immobilized via
bovine serum albumin–biotin–neutravidin as described
previously,36 and the flow cells were sealed
for imaging in the upright position. For the correlation of the SBFM
imaging with the sm-microscope imaging, a grid was hand-drawn onto
the coverslip of the specimen.

Smartphone-Based Fluorescence
Microscopy
The 532 nm
cw-laser (CW532 04 Series, Roithner Lasertechnik GmbH, Vienna, Austria)
employed for the dark-field excitation in the SBFM setup has a measured
mean output power of 64.5 mW. It was cleaned up (HC Laser Clean-up
MaxLine 532/2, AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen, Germany). For
alignment and power-dependent measurements, the laser beam was attenuated
using neutral density filters (Figure 1). A bifocal lens (f = 30 cm) was
utilized to focus the laser beam in a 45° angle onto the sample.
For this lens, we estimate an illumination area of around 1 mm2, leading to a power density of the order of 100 kW/m2, which might vary with every new adjustment. A lens (f = 2.6 mm, LS-40166, UCTronics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China)
mounted on the smartphone holder collected the fluorescence, which
was further cleaned by spectral filtering (582/75 nm BrightLine, Semrock
Inc, Rochester, New York). The smartphones used in our experiments
were the Huawei P10 Plus (Huawei Technologies, Shenzhen, China) and
the LG V10 (LG Electronics, Seoul, Republic of Korea). For camera
comparison, parameters for image recording were set to ISO 800, shutter
speed ts = 1/4 s, infinite manual focus,
and no brightness correction together with 8× and 10× zoom
for the LG V10 and Huawei P10 Plus, respectively. Under these conditions,
we imaged a commercial grid (Thorlabs Grid Distortion Target, 3″
× 1″) to determine that each pixel corresponds to dimensions
of 81 nm (LG) and 64 nm (Huawei) in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
For further measurements with the Huawei P10, the ISO was decreased
to ISO 400 and the shutter speed to ts = 1/15 s. The Huawei P10 Plus does not support RAW-capture, and
so JPG images were recorded. Line profiles were plotted with the ImageJ
software. Tonal correction (levels) as well as contrast and brightness
enhancement were performed using Adobe Photoshop (CS5.5, Adobe Systems
Software Ireland Limited, Dublin, Republic of Ireland).

Single-Molecule
Sensitive Wide-Field Fluorescence Microscopy
For image capturing
with the single-molecule sensitive wide-field
super-resolution microscope (SR GSD, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany) in the TIRF mode, a penetration depth of 179 nm, an exposure
time of tex = 100 ms, and an electron
multiplying gain of 50 were employed. For samples A to D, an excitation
power of 10% was employed, whereas for sample E, the excitation power
was increased to 15%. Brightness scales were adjusted using the associated
software.

Confocal Microscopy
The intensity distributions were
obtained through confocal microscope measurements as described elsewhere.37 Laser intensities were adjusted with ND filters
to avoid saturation effects. Intensities were obtained from scan images
and compared with origami pillars incorporating a single ATTO542 fluorophore.36 Relative intensity distributions were plotted
and fitted with a Gaussian function (Figure S3).

Determination of the Weber Contrast
The Weber contrast
is defined as CW = (I – IB)/IB, with I and IB representing the fluorescence and background intensities, respectively.
It was determined using the ImageJ software as follows: First, the
offset of the smartphone camera was determined from a dark image and
subtracted from all intensity values. For every detected spot, the
integrated intensity I within a circle with a diameter
of 50 px was calculated. For background subtraction, the integrated
intensity of an outer circle around the first one with a diameter
of 70 px was calculated. The intensity of the inner circle was subtracted
from the intensity of the outer circle, yielding the background intensity IB. Spots where circles interlaced with other
spots or where circles were not positioned concentrically with respect
to the spot were not taken into account.
