Plastic products
have brought us great convenience in our daily
life and work. But in the meantime, waste plastics have become solid
pollutants in the environment due to its poor degradability. The resource
utilization of waste plastic can decrease environmental pollution.
Here, a thermal reduction method for the conversion of waste polyethylene
to ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3 in a stainless-steel autoclave
under mild conditions has been reported. X-ray powder diffraction
patterns indicate that the obtained samples are anti-perovskite-structured
ternary carbides (ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3) with good
crystallinity. Moreover, the formation mechanism of ternary carbides
has been briefly discussed. This method can be developed into an effective
method for disposal of other waste plastics.

1 Introduction
Since the remarkable discovery
of superconductivity at 8 K in MgCNi3,1 the anti-perovskite-structured
compounds (ternary carbides and nitrides) have attracted great attention
due to their excellent physical properties such as giant magnetoresistance
effect,2,3 negative thermal expansion,4 nearly zero temperature resistivity coefficient,5−7 giant barocaloric effect,8 magnetostriction,9 spin-glass behavior,10−13 phase separation,14 and magnetocaloric effect.15

Up to now, considerable efforts have been made to
explore new methods
to synthesize ternary carbides with anti-perovskite structure, including
repeated sintering,1 self-propagating high-temperature
synthesis,16 the mechanical alloying method,17 and conventional powder metallurgy.18 Xia and co-workers have synthesized MgCNi3 bulk materials at 850 °C for several tens of minutes
through a hybrid microwave heating method.19 Single crystalline MgCNi3 of several hundred micrometers
in size can also be successfully synthesized by heat treatment of
a mixture of carbon, metallic Mg, and Ni powders under high-pressure
(4.25 GPa) conditions at 1200 °C for 1 h.20 Rana and co-workers have synthesized ternary carbides (MgCNi3 or MgCxCo3) encapsulated
in carbon nanoflasks by using metallic Mg–EtOH powder and Ni(CO)4 or cobalt tricarbonyl nitrosyl as starting materials at 1000
°C for 3 h.21,22 Y3AlCx (x = 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.5) samples
can also be synthesized by arc-melting and subsequent annealing.23 Tong and his co-workers have synthesized a series
of ternary carbides with anti-perovskite structure from the corresponding
elements by a direct solid-state reaction.2,7,12 However, as we have seen, there are few
research studies on the preparation and properties of ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3. In this paper, a facile procedure for the
preparation of ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3 by a chemical
reaction under mild conditions has been reported.

Plastic products
have been used widely in the industrial fields
and in daily life due to their excellent properties such as light,
high transparency, low cost, durability, and good corrosion resistance.
However, solid pollutants caused by waste plastics have become more
and more serious with the increasing use of plastic products. Thus,
resource utilization of waste plastics is helpful for environmental
protection. Recently, some effort has been made to convert waste plastics
into valuable carbon-based materials. Different forms of carbon materials
have been prepared by utilizing waste plastic (poly(ethylene terephthalate),
poly(tetrafluoroethylene), polyethylene (PE), etc.) as a carbon source.24−29 Waste plastic can also be used as a carbon source to prepare carbide
materials (SiC, TiC, ZrC, VC, NbC, Cr3C2, Cr2AlC, etc.).30−36 You and co-workers have synthesized NiO nanorods, monolayer graphene,
and SiC nanowires from waste materials through a green chemical vapor
method.37 The above approaches of converting
waste plastic to valuable materials can deliver important significance
in environmental protection.

Herein, a one-step thermal reduction
process is designed to produce
ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3 by using waste PE as a carbon
source in a stainless-steel autoclave at 800 °C. This study provides
a simple and effective route for converting waste plastics into high-value
carbide materials. The reaction temperature used in our method for
the production of ternary carbides is lower than those of the reported
methods.

2 Results and Discussion
The Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was used to investigate
the chemical structure of waste plastic bags. From the FTIR spectrum
(Figure 1), the main
chemical composition was high-density polyethylene. The phase structure
and purity of the obtained sample were investigated by X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD). Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of the ZnCCo3 sample. Three
diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern located at 2θ = 41.97,
48.91, and 71.61° could be indexed as the (111), (200), and (220)
diffraction planes of the cubic phase ZnCCo3 with a lattice
constant of a = 3.734 Å, which is in agreement
with the reported data (JCPDS cards No. 29-0524, a = 3.730 Å). All of the above results prove that the obtained
sample is anti-perovskite-structured ZnCCo3. The yield
of ZnCCo3 is calculated to be about 56%, according to the
quality of ZnCCo3 and raw material (metallic cobalt).

Figure 2 Typical XRD pattern of
the obtained ZnCCo3 sample.

The morphology, microstructure, and composition of the obtained
ZnCCo3 sample were further investigated with scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The SEM image of the
obtained ZnCCo3 sample is shown in Figure 3a, which reveals that the ZnCCo3 sample is composed of particles with different sizes. A typical
TEM image (shown in Figure 3b) shows that the size of ZnCCo3 particles is in
the range of 50–200 nm. The HRTEM image (shown in Figure 3c) shows that the
crystal lattice spacing of 0.37 nm corresponds to the d spacing values of the (100) and (010) planes of cubic phase ZnCCo3. A typical selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
of the obtained ZnCCo3 particles (inset of Figure 3c) recorded along the ⟨001⟩
zone axis confirms that the obtained ZnCCo3 particles are
well crystalline, and the diffraction spots can be indexed to the
diffractions of cubic phase ZnCCo3, which is close to the
result of the XRD pattern (Figure 2). The EDX spectrum taken from the obtained ZnCCo3 particles is shown in Figure 3d, which shows intense peaks of C, Cu, Zn, and Co.
The Cu signals come from the TEM grid. The EDX spectrum indicates
that the obtained ZnCCo3 particles consist of C, Zn, and
Co.

TEM image of the obtained ZnCCo3 sample; (c) HRTEM image
of the obtained ZnCCo3 sample (inset shows the corresponding
SAED pattern); and (d) EDX pattern.

All of the three diffraction peaks in Figure 4 (XRD pattern of the obtained ZnCNi3 sample) located at 2θ = 42.88, 49.93, and 73.27° could
be indexed as the (111), (200), and (220) planes of anti-perovskite-structured
ZnCNi3 with a lattice constant of a =
3.650 Å, which is consistent with the earlier report by Park
and co-workers (a = 3.660 Å).38 The yield of ZnCNi3 is calculated to be about
68%, according to the quality of ZnCNi3 and raw material
(metallic nickel). SEM image and TEM image are shown in Figure 5a,b, respectively, which clearly
show that the ZnCNi3 sample consists of nanoparticles with
an average particle size of 40 nm.

TEM image of the obtained ZnCNi3 sample.

The magnetic behavior is of great importance for the practical
applications of materials. The magnetic properties of the ternary
carbides were investigated at room temperature. The magnetic hysteresis
curves for the obtained ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3 samples
are shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The hysteresis loop of ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3 exhibits a ferromagnetic behavior. The magnetization, magnetic
coercivity, and remanent magnetization of ZnCCo3 particles
are 2.73 emu/g, 68 Oe, and 0.14 emu/g, respectively. The magnetization,
magnetic coercivity, and remnant magnetization of ZnCNi3 nanoparticles are 0.11 emu/g, 173.9 Oe, and 0.02 emu/g, respectively.
Due to the lack of preparation methods of the anti-perovskite-structured
carbides, the magnetic properties of the pure ZnCCo3 and
ZnCNi3 have not been reported. Therefore, further work
of the magnetic properties is underway to understand the relationship
between nanostructure and magnetism in those materials.

obtained ZnCCo3 sample and (b) the obtained ZnCNi3 sample.

In our present approach to synthesize
the anti-perovskite-structured
ternary carbide, a possible formation mechanism is proposed. With
the temperature increasing, metallic sodium reacts with zinc chloride
to produce nascent zinc (Zn*) and sodium chloride (eq 1) Meanwhile, waste PE decomposed
generating nascent carbon (C*) and H2 (eq 2). The nascent Zn and nascent C
(with high reactivity) can react with transition metal (cobalt or
nickel) to produce ternary carbides (ZnCCo3 or ZnCNi3) at a low temperature of 800 °C [eq 3]. Based on free-energy calculations, reaction 1 is thermodynamic,
spontaneous (ΔrGm = −379.28
kJ/mol), and highly exothermic (ΔrHm = −405.93 kJ/mol). From the ΔrHm value of reaction 1, it can be seen that a large amount of heat
has been generated from reaction 1, which is conducive to the formation of ternary carbides
at low temperature. Therefore, the possible formation process of MgCNi3 can be described as follows 1   2   3  All of the total reaction process could also
be represented as follows  

3 Conclusions
In this study, anti-perovskite-structured
ZnCCo3 and
ZnCNi3 have been successfully synthesized by a facile one-step
chemical reaction at a relatively low temperature of 800 °C.
This work provides an effective method to convert waste PE to valuable
ternary carbide with anti-perovskite structure. The magnetic behaviors
of the obtained samples have been briefly investigated. This synthesis
method can be applied to prepare other ternary carbides.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
Waste
polyethylene used
in our experiments was recovered from plastic bags (main components:
PE). All of the other reagents were of analytical purity and purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

4.2 Preparation
of ZnCCo3 Particles
In a typical synthesis process,
zinc chloride (2.70 g), cobalt
metal (1.80 g), waste polyethylene (1.00 g) and sodium metal (2.00
g) were added into a stainless-steel autoclave of about 20 mL capacity.
After sealing tightly, the autoclave was heated in an electronic furnace
from room temperature to 10 °C/min at 800 °C and maintained
at 800 °C for 10 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled
to room temperature, a black sample was collected from the autoclave
and washed with anhydrous alcohol to remove excess metallic sodium.
The sample was then washed with diluted hydrochloric acid and distilled
water to remove other impurities. Finally, the obtained sample was
dried at 50 °C under vacuum for further identification.

4.3 Preparation of ZnCNi3 Nanoparticles
The
experimental procedure for the preparation of ZnCNi3 is
similar to that employed to produce ZnCNi3, except
that metallic cobalt was substituted by metallic nickel (1.80 g).
The preparation procedures are summarized diagrammatically in Scheme 1.

Preparation of ZnCCo3 and ZnCNi3
4.4 Samples’ Characterization
The phase of the obtained samples was investigated by X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD), using a Philips X’pert X-ray diffractometer
(Cu Kα λ = 1.54178 Å). The microstructures of the
obtained samples were derived from scanning electron microscopy images
(FESEM, JEOL-JSM-6700F). The magnetic hysteresis loop was determined
by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, BHV-55). Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) image, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern,
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis were carried out
on a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscope (at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV). The magnetic properties were investigated on a
SQUID magnetometer.
