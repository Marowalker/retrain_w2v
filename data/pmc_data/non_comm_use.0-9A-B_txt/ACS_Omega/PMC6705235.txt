Clay/polymer nanocomposites
(CPNs) are polymers incorporating refined
clay particles that are frequently functionalized with quaternary
ammonium cations (QACs) as dispersion aids. There is interest in commercializing
CPNs for food contact applications because they have improved strength
and barrier properties, but there are few studies on the potential
for QACs in CPNs to transfer to foods under conditions of intended
use. In this study, we manufactured low-density poly(ethylene) (LDPE)-based
CPNs and assessed whether QACs can migrate into several food simulants
under accelerated storage conditions. QACs were found to migrate to
a fatty food simulant (ethanol) at levels of ∼1.1 μg
mg–1 CPN mass after 10 days at 40 °C, constituting
about 4% total migration (proportion of the initial QAC content in
the CPN that migrated to the simulant). QAC migration into ethanol
was ∼16× higher from LDPE containing approximately the
same concentration of QACs but no clay, suggesting that most QACs
in the CPN are tightly bound to clay particles and are immobile. Negligible
QACs were found to migrate into aqueous, alcoholic, or acidic simulants
from CPNs, and the amount of migrated QACs was also found to scale
with the temperature and the initial clay concentration. The migration
data were compared to a theoretical diffusion model, and it was found
that the diffusion constant for QACs in the CPN was several orders
of magnitude slower than predicted, which we attributed to the potential
for QACs to migrate as dimers or other aggregates rather than as individual
ions. Nevertheless, the use of the migration model resulted in a conservative
estimate of the mass transfer of QAC from the CPN test specimens.

Introduction
Clay/polymer nanocomposites
(CPNs) are polymeric materials incorporating
refined clay particles as fillers. Because of their high specific
surface area, exfoliated clays enhance many of the physical properties
of plastics.1 As such, CPNs have been explored
for applications including flame-retardant textile coatings,2−6 high strength automotive and structural components,7−11 and food packaging.12−14 In the latter case, dispersed clays improve toughness
and tensile strength of the host polymer, and they create a tortuous
path for the diffusion of gasses and other molecules.12 These improvements bring opportunities for better food
quality and safety via shelf-life elongation and cost savings and
reduced environmental footprint via packaging material downgauging.

The introduction of CPNs and other nanocomposites into the marketplace
is not without its challenges. One hurdle is ensuring that CPNs are
safe for humans and the environment throughout product life-cycles,
particularly the use phase. In association with food packaging applications,
studies have explored both the potential toxicity of clay particles15−20 and the release (migration) of substances from CPNs into food simulants.20−30 Most published CPN exposure studies have fixated on the inorganic
clay particles, with less attention paid to the fate of organic surfactant
modifiers, such as quaternary ammonium cations (QACs), used to enhance
the compatibility of hydrophilic clays with the hydrophobic polymer
phase. This constitutes an important knowledge gap in the peer-reviewed
literature, especially given what is known about the potential health
and environmental impact of QACs.31−34

To date, the only experimental
effort to quantify QAC surfactants
migrated from CPNs in a food packaging application and documented
in the scientific literature was undertaken by Xia and co-workers.21,22 These studies provided evidence that QACs migrate from CPNs manufactured
from poly(propylene) and Nylon 6 into ethanol. The quantity of migrated
QACs was found to be significantly higher than the amount of released
inorganic clay, suggesting that QACs may constitute the greater exposure
risk to consumers from CPNs. A dependence of QAC release on the host
polymer, attributed to the strength of interactions between dispersed
clay and the polymer, was also indicated. A broader array of QAC migration
data, however, is still needed to formulate a general understanding
of how embedded clay particles attenuate the QAC migration process.
In particular, it is important to verify that common mathematical
migration models, which were developed for neutral organic additives
to food packaging polymers, provide a conservative estimate of potential
exposure to QACs from CPNs under intended conditions of use.

We incorporated organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) clay
particles into low-density poly(ethylene) (LDPE) cast films at several
weight percentages and used them to evaluate potential human exposure
to QACs from CPNs in a food contact application. LDPE was selected
as a host polymer because it finds broad use as a contact layer in
food packaging, is inexpensive, and possesses low barriers to migration,
which would make it an attractive industry candidate for improvement
with clay incorporation. After fabrication, the CPN films were fully
characterized, and migration of the QACs from these materials into
a series of food simulants was assessed under conditions recommended
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to simulate extended room-temperature
storage.35 The food simulants used were
100% ethanol (fatty food), water (aqueous food), 3% aqueous acetic
acid (acidic food), and 10% aqueous ethanol (alcoholic food). In addition
to the CPNs, LDPE films incorporating the surfactant mixture only
(no clays) were fabricated to evaluate how the presence of clay particles
changes the migration kinetics of the QAC. Finally, we compared the
experimental data to predictive migration models to evaluate the suitability
of these models for conservative exposure assessments of QAC additives
from CPNs.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of OMMT Clay
The
OMMT used in this
study was Cloisite 20. Cloisite 20 is a purified montmorillonite,
a naturally occurring, 2:1 layered aluminum phyllosilicate mineral
in the smectite group, modified with bis(hydrogenated tallow alkyl)
dimethylammonium chloride. This organic surfactant modifier, which
is available under the trade name Arquad 2HT-75, is a mixture of QACs
derived from purified triglycerides in beef tallow. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) revealed that Cloisite 20 powder is composed of <0.5
wt % water and 61.32 (0.41) wt % inorganic clay (Supporting Information, Figure S1 and Table S3). X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis of Cloisite 20 powder (Figure 1A) yielded an interplatelet layer spacing (d001 value) of 3.3 nm, in good agreement with
data supplied by the manufacturer (nominal d001 value = 3.16 nm). In contrast, XRD analysis of an MMT powder
without organic functionalization (Cloisite 116, BYK Additives) possessed
a d001 value of 1.3 nm, demonstrating
that organic surface functionalization of the MMT clay weakens interplatelet
attractive forces and facilitates delamination during CPN manufacture.

CPN film (blue) and a neat LDPE film (black). The approximate interplatelet
spacings (d001 values) are indicated based
on the respective peak maxima.

Fabrication and Characterization of CPNs
Cloisite 20
was incorporated into LDPE via melt processing on a laboratory scale,
twin-screw microcompounder using a masterbatch process. To facilitate
dispersion of the OMMT into LDPE, a compatibilizer (maleic anhydride-grafted
polyethylene, PE-g-MA) was used. CPN films with 1,
3, 5, and 7 wt % OMMT in LDPE were prepared as well as negative (PE-g-MA/LDPE only) and positive (Arquad 2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE) control films. Tabulated nominal compositions for each
CPN and control material are provided in the Supporting Information
(Table S2). For OMMT-containing films,
the OMMT/PE-g-MA mass ratio was kept constant at
1:3. This ratio was chosen to ensure good compatibility of the OMMT
with the polymer.36 In the case of the
positive control film, LDPE was charged with 4 wt % Arquad 2HT-75.
This amount of Arquad 2HT-75 has a similar QAC content to what is
bound to Cloisite 20 platelets in the 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE film (Table S2). Note that two
separate, nominally identical sets of OMMT-containing LDPE films spanning
an OMMT weight range of 1–7 wt % were fabricated to check the
reproducibility of results, and these are referred to as series I
and series II.

After sufficient mixing, the polymer melt was
extruded through a 65 mm film die under constant pressure and rapidly
cooled with a stream of nitrogen to obtain cast thin films of approximately
40–60 μm thickness. A photograph of representative 5
wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE and neat LDPE films is shown
in Figure 2. Both neat
and clay-containing films were slightly hazy, which is typical of
semicrystalline LDPE, but the addition of clay does not result in
additional haze or coloration. TGA of OMMT-containing LDPE films confirmed
that the experimental wt % of OMMT reasonably matched the target wt
% in all cases (Supporting Information, Table S3). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Figure 3) revealed the presence
of OMMT aggregates typically on the order of 20–30 nm thick
and up to 150–200 nm long, although smaller clusters of platelets
and well-separated platelets were also observed. The lateral dimensions
of the clay aggregates and isolated platelets observed in the polymer
are roughly on the same order of what has been found for exfoliated
sodium montmorillonite suspended in water.37

OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE nanocomposites under low (i, iii:
scale bar = 2 μm) and high (ii, iv: scale bar = 0.2 μm)
magnifications.

XRD performed on the OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE film (5
wt % OMMT, series I) shows that the mean interplatelet distance increases
to ∼8.8 nm compared to the ∼3.3 nm that was observed
for Cloisite 20 powder (Figure 1). This finding confirms that mixing OMMT into the polymer
melt using extensional flow screws and a high concentration of PE-g-MA compatibilizer leads to effective intercalation of
polymer strands into the interplatelet gallery volume. We did not
observe a significant difference in the clay scattering peak position
as a function of the clay content (data not shown), but this may be
due to the poor performance of the XRD hardware at such low scattering
angles and/or the low concentration of platelets in films with OMMT
content <3 wt %. For this reason, XRD is a poor method for measuring
OMMT exfoliation when the interplatelet distance exceeds 8 nm.38

Fourier transform infrared-attenuated
total reflection (FTIR-ATR)
spectroscopy provides additional information about the dispersion
of OMMT in the LDPE-based CPNs. MMTs and other layered silicates possess
strong absorption bands in the 1000–1100 cm–1 region that arise from silicon–oxygen stretching modes.39 The silicon–oxygen stretching region
is typically understood to be comprised of four overlapping peaks.
Stretches involving Si–O–Si linkages parallel to the
clay layer surface have their transition moments lying in the plane
of the clay platelet layer (peaks I, III, and IV; in-plane stretches),
whereas stretches involving Si–O bonds directed toward the
alumina octahedra have transition moments oriented perpendicular to
the platelet surface (peak II, out-of-plane stretch).40 Cole has shown that the peak II (∼1080 cm–1) peak max frequency and the peak III/IV (∼1045/∼1024
cm–1) intensity ratio are both sensitive to the
degree of OMMT exfoliation in LDPE-based CPNs, with higher degrees
of MMT platelet delamination favoring shifts of peak II to higher
frequencies and broader bandwidths and larger peak III/IV intensity
ratios.38

Figure 4 shows FTIR-ATR
spectra in the silicon–oxygen stretching region of the series
I OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE films, all recorded with force
settings <1 (minimal compression of the film to enhance contact
of the film with the ATR crystal). The spectra of the Cloisite 20
and Cloisite 116 powders are also provided. Compared to the FTIR-ATR
spectrum of Cloisite 116 (an unmodified inorganic clay), the silicon–oxygen
stretching peak envelope of Cloisite 20 is narrower, although the
out-of-plane stretching peak (II) is still obscured by the in-plane
stretching peaks (III and IV), showing that inorganic platelets are
closely stacked in the organically modified Cloisite 20 powder. In
contrast, the incorporation of Cloisite 20 into LDPE at all concentrations
results in the out-of-plane stretching vibration (II) coming into
clear prominence and narrowing of the peak III/IV spectral envelope.
These changes signify intercalation of polymer strands between OMMT
platelets and are consistent with the XRD measurements. Interestingly,
as the wt % of Cloisite 20 increases from 1 to 7 wt %, the relative
prominence of peak II decreases and shifts to lower frequency (Δν
= 4 cm–1), and the peak III/IV intensity ratio decreases.
These changes mean that OMMT platelets in films with higher total
clay loadings exhibit lower mean separation distances between individual
platelets. FTIR-ATR spectral features associated with the OMMT in
these CPNs are highly sensitive to the pressure used to enforce good
contact between the film samples and the diamond ATR crystal (Supporting
Information, Figure S2). Generally, increasing
the force gauge pressure results in an intensification of peak II
and little change in the peak III/IV intensity ratio. This supports
the conclusion that polymer-dispersed clay platelets are at least
partially aligned with the film plane, probably during the drawing
of the polymer melt through the film die, and they become more aligned
during compression of the film for FTIR-ATR analysis. A more detailed
explanation of these effects is provided in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 FTIR-ATR spectra of the silicon–oxygen
stretching region
of LDPE films containing (a, black) 1 wt %, (b, red) 3 wt %, (c, green)
5 wt %, and (d, blue) 7 wt % Cloisite 20 and of neat (e, teal) Cloisite
20 and (f, orange) Cloisite 116 MMT powders. The spectra have been
offset for clarity. In-plane (I, III, and IV) and out-of-plane (II)
silicon–oxygen stretching vibrations are indicated. All spectra
were recorded with a force gauge setting of <1. The spectrum for
1 wt % Cloisite 20 in LDPE was subjected to a 1% LOESS curve smoothening
function to improve clarity.

The crystalline content and melting behavior of the LDPE phase
in OMMT/LDPE CPNs were also evaluated. Crystallinity values and melting
points are provided in Table 1. XRD curves in the 10–40° 2θ range and
extracted crystalline parameters are plotted in the Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4. As the OMMT content is increased,
the crystallinity of the polymer phase decreases significantly from
47.1% in the neat LDPE film to 33.6% in the film containing 7 wt %
OMMT. It is unclear whether it is the clay particles, QAC surfactants,
or the PE-g-MA compatibilizer that interferes with
LDPE crystallization at higher clay loading. Previous work has shown
that exfoliated clay fillers in polymers may decrease the crystallinity
of the polymer phase by restricting the movement of polymer chains;41 concurrently, we note that the crystallinities
of the control films containing 21/79 wt % PE-g-MA/LDPE
(46.4 ± 1.1%) and 2.8/21/76.2 wt % Arquad 2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE (43.9 ± 2.1%) are only slightly lower than that determined
for neat LDPE, suggesting that the exfoliated clay in the CPNs is
primarily responsible for the decreased crystallinity of the polymer
phase in these materials. Interestingly, the XRD data show that as
the clay content increases, the relative peak area of the 110 and
200 Bragg reflections decreases (Table 1). A lower ratio has been interpreted to signal an
improved alignment of the polymer chains within crystallites with
the drawing direction.42 Since the drawing
torque is nominally the same for all of the films, the enhanced alignment
of polymer crystallites in CPNs with higher clay content must be primarily
related to the change in CPN composition, possibly due to a more strongly
preferred orientation of crystals during growth in close proximity
to clay particle surfaces. A similar effect has been observed for
graphene/PE composites43 and other exfoliated
clay systems.44,45 This would be consistent with
the FTIR-ATR data presented above, which show that clay particles
are at least partially aligned with the film plane during the manufacturing
process, and this alignment apparently defines the anisotropic growth
of polymer crystallites as well.

Characterization of QACs
in Food Simulants
In an early
experiment to ascertain the potential for QACs from Cloisite 20 to
migrate from CPNs to food simulants, 42 mm diameter sections were
punched from a 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE CPN film
(and a neat LDPE control film), and the sections were stored in 100%
ethanol for 30 days at 75 °C. A temperature of 75 °C was
used for this preliminary work to accelerate the migration process
and aid in the initial method development. After the experiment, the
solutions were cooled, upon which a white precipitate formed in the
ethanol contacting the OMMT-containing films that was assumed to be
migrated QACs. Representative mass spectra of these ethanolic solutions
in positive ionization mode over the m/z range of relevance to the target QACs are shown in Figure 5. Spectra over the full m/z range are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S5. Both solutions produced common peaks
in the m/z = 325–375 and
600–700 regions, but the solution stored in the presence of
7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE exhibited additional peaks
in the m/z = 450–560 region.

Figure 5 Representative
high-resolution mass spectra of a 100% ethanol solution
in which a neat 42 mm circular section of (A) neat LDPE or (B) 7 wt
% OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE has been stored at 75 °C
for 30 days. The identified peaks correspond to QACs in Arquad 2HT-75.
The four peaks highlighted in red are the target ions (Table 2), with the major component
ion identified. Other peaks are also QACs but were not analytical
targets. The m/z values have been
rounded to the nearest hundredth to simplify the presentation.

Arquad 2HT-75 is composed of QACs that contain
a central nitrogen
bonded to two methyl groups and a statistically determined pair of
aliphatic carbon chains derived from the lipid profile of beef tallow.
In an earlier methodological paper,46 we
provided a description of the distribution of QACs present in an Arquad
2HT-75 lot that could migrate to food simulants from CPN films fabricated
with Cloisite 20. We have focused our analysis on four ions that together
comprise the majority (>85%) of QACs in Arquad 2HT-75, and their
chemical
identities and molecular weights are summarized in Table 2. Note that these ions correspond to four of the major peaks
in the m/z = 450–560 region
of the mass spectrum of the ethanolic solution that was contacting
the 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE film (Figure 5), and the peak intensities
closely match the corresponding weight-based abundances expected from
a pure sample of Arquad 2HT-75 (Table 2). Based on this preliminary analysis, we concluded
that QACs were migrating from Cloisite 20-containing CPNs in significant
amounts, and we could use the QAC markers at m/z = 466.5, 494.6, 522.6, and 550.6 to quantify this process.
Note that the additional peaks that show up in the mass spectra of
the ethanol solutions stored in the presence of both the OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE and neat LDPE films (Figure S5) correspond to additives (e.g., slip agents, antioxidants)
in the LDPE polymer resin; by cross-referencing the experimental m/z values with tables of common polymer
additives,47 some of them could be identified
(see the Supporting Information, Table S4).

Table 2 Chemical Structures of Target QACsa in Arquad 2HT-75
a Multiple QACs in
Arquad 2HT-75 share
the same mass. For example, C20–C16, C19–C17, and C18–C18
are all in Arquad 2HT-75 and all have the exact same mass of 550.62
g mol–1. Due to certain fatty acids being significantly
more abundant in beef tallow, a single QAC is usually responsible
for most of the peak intensity in the mass spectrum at any given m/z value. To simplify the discussion,
we refer to the peaks by the most statistically abundant isomer giving
rise to that peak, which is indicated in the “major ion”
column.

b The relative proportion
of each
QAC in the sample, calculated by dividing the integrated peak area
at the corresponding m/z value by
the total peak area for all QACs over a range for m/z = 410–590 in the mass spectrum of a 10
ppm infusion of Arquad 2HT-75 in ethanol.46 Note that because of natural variation in the lipid content of beef
tallow, QAC abundances vary slightly for different Arquad 2HT-75 lots.
For simplicity, the Cloisite 20 used for PCN manufacture is assumed
to have a similar QAC profile to the pure Arquad 2HT-75 lot.

Kinetics of QACs Migration from CPNs into
Ethanol
The
kinetics of QAC migration from 42 mm diameter sections of 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE films was measured at 40 °C over a period
of several weeks. Figure 6 plots the sum of the masses of the four target QAC ions migrated
from this CPN (blue line) into 100% ethanol versus immersion time,
as determined by flow-injection mass spectrometry (FI-MS). The migrated
QAC mass has been expressed relative to the initial film section mass
to account for the varying film thicknesses for each of the three
experimental replicates. The amount of QACs migrated from negative
(PE-g-MA/LDPE film, black line) and positive (PE-g-MA/LDPE containing a similar amount of QACs from Arquad
2HT-75 but no clay, red line) control materials is also plotted. Tabulated
migration data for all four tracked QACs are provided in the Supporting
Information, Table S5.

Figure 6 Total mass of QACs migrated
from 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE (blue), 4 wt % Arquad
2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE
(red), and PE-g-MA/LDPE (black) into 100% ethanol
after storage at 40 °C, plotted as a function of storage time.
The total QAC migration is the sum of QACs having molecular weights
of 550.6, 522.6, 494.6, and 466.5 g mol–1, divided
by the initial film mass. Error bars represent the standard deviation
from the mean (n = 3). The gray bar is meant to highlight
migration at 10 days. The dashed blue line shows the 7 wt % OMMT data
multiplied by 5 to highlight the trend.

The kinetic data (Table S5) show that
at the first time point the three heavier QACs are quantifiable in
the simulant stored in the presence of the film containing Cloisite
20, and all four QACs are quantifiable by 1 day of storage at 40 °C.
The summed concentrations of all four QACs continually rise as the
storage time increases and is still rising even at 29 days (696 h),
indicating a kinetically controlled migration process. QACs at the
four target masses migrate at approximately the same rate, as shown
by normalizing the mean released mass of each QAC at each time point
to the average amount released at 10 days (Figure 7). This trend was unexpected, because smaller
polymer additives tend to migrate faster than larger ones. The release
of QACs from the Arquad 2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE film
containing a similar concentration of QACs, but no clay, also increases
over time, but the migrated concentrations are significantly higher
than the amount migrated from the clay-containing film (Figure 6, red line). Unlike what is
observed in the OMMT-containing CPN, no further increase in the amount
of migrated QACs is observed in the Arquad 2HT-75 film after 15 days,
suggesting that equilibrium may be reached sooner for the positive
control film than for the CPN. The longer equilibration time in the
CPN film may be in part due to the tortuous path effect created by
the exfoliated clay particles, which is known to slow rates of molecular
diffusion in CPNs.12 This is consistent
with gas barrier measurements we conducted on an earlier batch of
CPNs, which revealed a reduction in the oxygen transmission rate from
10.96 ± 0.40 × 10–10 μmol O2 @STP m–1 s–1 Pa–1 in a neat LDPE film to 7.32 ± 0.61 × 10–10 μmol O2 @STP m–1 s–1 Pa–1 in a 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE
film.

Figure 7 Mass of QACs with m/z = 550.6
(C18–C18, black square), 522.6 (C18–C16, red circle),
494.6 (C16–C16, red upward triangle), and 466.5 (C16–C14,
blue downward triangle) migrated from a 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE film into 100 % ethanol as a function of time spent at 40
°C, divided by the corresponding amount of QAC migrated at 10
days. Error bars represent standard deviations. A trend line (black)
has been added to guide the eye.

The FDA recommends a standard testing protocol of 10 days at 40
°C to simulate the potential migration during long-term storage
at ambient temperature. This recommendation stems from experimental
studies showing that migration levels under these accelerated conditions
are approximately the same as those observed after extended storage
(6–12 months) at 20 °C (68 °F).35 Therefore, the 10 day time point serves as a suitable benchmark
at which to compare QAC migrant levels from different materials and
into different food simulants. After 10 days at 40 °C, the total
QAC level migrated from the 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE
film was measured to be 998.43 ± 85.36 ng mg–1 CPN material. The four target ions constitute about 89 wt % of all
of the QACs present in Arquad 2HT-75 (Table 2). Assuming the remaining QAC ions not quantitated
by our method also migrate in approximately proportionate amounts,
the total amount of QACs migrated from the CPN material after 10 days
is expected to be ∼1120 ng mg–1 CPN. Because
the CPN contains 2.837 wt % (28.37 μg mg–1) Arquad 2HT-75 (Table S3C), this suggests
that the percent total migration (amount migrated divided by the initial
amount of QACs in the film) was about 3.9% after 10 days storage.
By comparison, the % total migration of QACs from the 4 wt % Arquad
2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE film (red line, Figure 6) was about 66.1%, >16 times
higher. No migration was observed from the negative control film (neat
LDPE with PE-g-MA only).

In organically modified
MMTs, QACs bind to clay particles via strong
ionic interactions between the positively charged QAC head groups
and negatively charged defects in the silicate surface layer.48 We conclude that strong binding of QAC surfactants
by the high surface area clay platelets restricts their release into
the environment from CPNs during prolonged storage. To verify this
hypothesis, we performed aggressive extraction tests of the Arquad
2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE and OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE films into methylene chloride for several days at 50 °C
and again found >90% QAC recovery values from the Arquad 2HT-75
film
but recoveries typically in the range of 3–10% for the CPNs.
Likewise, the extraction of QACs directly from Cloisite 20 powder
into neat ethanol at 40 °C showed recoveries of the different
QAC ions ranging from 10 to 25% and remained essentially unchanged
over 96 h. These experiments confirm that strong binding of QACs to
the clay particles is responsible for the significantly reduced migration
of QACs from the CPN compared to migration from the positive control
material containing Arquad 2HT-75, in which all of the QACs are free
to diffuse out of the polymer matrix.

Modeling Migration of QACs
into 100% Ethanol
To better
understand QAC migration to a fatty food simulant, we compared the
migration data to a diffusion-based theoretical model. Because Arquad
2HT-75 is a mixture of QACs having different sizes, we focused on
QACs with a molecular weight of 550.6 g mol–1, which
are dominated by a single geometric isomer (C18–C18). The key
parameters that determine mass transfer of an additive from a polymer
to a food simulant are the diffusion rate constant, DP, and the relative solubility of the additive in the
two phases, embodied in the partition coefficient, KPF. The amount of QAC migrating from the CPN film into
the surrounding food simulant at time t (MF,t) can be determined from
these two parameters using Fick’s second law, which has the
following analytical solution49,50 1    Here, A is the contact
area
(cm2); cP,t and cF,t are the concentrations
(μg g–1) of QAC in the polymer and simulant
at time t; ρP and ρF are the densities (g mL–1) of the polymer and
simulant; VP and VF are volumes (mL) of polymer and simulant; and dP is the film thickness (cm). Because migration may happen
from either side of the film, the total two-sided surface area is
considered, and the effective film thickness through which migration
occurs is taken as half of the actual thickness. Note that this model
assumes that the food simulant is well-mixed, which prevents locally
high concentrations of the migrant at the polymer–simulant
interface from reducing the concentration gradient that drives the
migration process. Under the assumption that the solubility of QACs
in the CPN and the Arquad 2HT-75 positive control film is similar,
the ratio of cP,∞ and cF,∞ was determined from the kinetic experiment
with the Arquad 2HT-75 film at 29 days (696 h), where no further migration
of QACs into the ethanol was observed. This resulted in an estimated KP,F ∼ 205 and α ∼ 5. Although
a good estimate of initial QAC concentration in the polymer is known,
most of these QACs are unavailable to migrate due to binding through
strong ionic interactions to clay surfaces; for this reason, an upper
limit effective initial QAC concentration was estimated as 10% of
the actual QAC concentration, based on aggressive extraction experiments
in which QAC recovery ranged from 3 to 10%. Additional information
on how these and other parameters were determined is provided in the Supporting Information.

Figure 8 plots experimental migration
data for m/z = 550.6 QACs from the
7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE film into 100% ethanol at
40 °C on a μg cm–2 basis, overlaid with
data simulated using eq 1. An initial estimate of DP was made
using a semiempirical model that was developed specifically for (conservatively)
predicting migration from food contact materials50 and relates the upper-bound diffusion constant, DP*, to the migrant’s molecular weight (Mr), the absolute temperature (T), and a polymer-specific
parameter, (AP) 2  Using an AP value
of 11.5 for pure LDPE49 and an Mr value of 586.85 g mol–1 (to
account for a chloride counterion), DP* = 1.4 × 10–9 cm2 s–1. It is immediately
apparent from Figure 8 that the migration of C18–C18 is slower than what would be
predicted from this estimated diffusion coefficient, in which migration
would reach equilibrium within just a few hours. Via a least square
fit of eq 1 to the experimental
data, the real DP appears to be on the
order of 1.6 × 10–12 cm2 s–1, almost 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that predicted by the
semiempirical model. Although eq 2 is designed to return a conservative estimate of DP to ensure an adequate safety margin for the
predicted migration, (DP*/DP)1/2 tends to be in the range of 2–8.50 Here, (DP*/DP)1/2 ∼ 30. We note that our experimental DP value for the C18–C18 QAC is about three times larger
than that determined by Xia et al.22 in
a poly(propylene)-based CPN (DP ∼
4.8 × 10–13 cm2 s–1); this is consistent with the higher permeability of LDPE in comparison
to poly(propylene).

Figure 8 Experimental data (black squares) for migration of QACs
with m/z = 550.6 (C18–C18)
from a 7 wt
% OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE film along with data simulated
from an analytical solution to Fick’s Second Law (eq 1) for two different diffusion coefficients.
The larger diffusion constant (DP* = 1.4 × 10–9 cm2 s–1) was determined from a conservative
semiempirical model (eq 2). The smaller diffusion constant (DP = 1.6 × 10–12 cm2 s–1) was determined by a least square fit to the averaged experimental
data. Each experimental data point is the mean of three independent
replicates and error bars represent standard deviations. Note that
when using DP* (blue line), equilibrium is predicted to be
reached within a few hours.

It is possible that some of the difference between the estimated
and experimental diffusion constants for QACs in the LDPE-based CPN
may be accounted for by the tortuosity effect of dispersed clay particles,
but this effect is typically modest. Approximations used in the various
input parameters in eqs 1 and 2 (e.g., the AP value, which was determined for pure LDPE) may also account for
some of the discrepancy. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the difference
led us to question the fundamental validity of the diffusion model,
particularly the assumption of the isotropic distribution of QACs
in the polymer that are available for migration. The ionic nature
of QACs implies strong interactions between the polar head groups
when they are dispersed in the relatively hydrophobic polymer interior,
such that individual QACs may not diffuse independently of each other.
This hypothesis is supported by prior work that has shown that QACs
aggregate strongly in nonpolar solvents, typically as dimers when
the QAC side chains are long and the QAC concentration is moderate.51 We note that C18–C18 dimers would have
a molecular weight (with two chloride counterions) of 1172.1 g mol–1, and eq 2 predicts DP* = 3.2 × 10–11 cm2 s–1 for these aggregates. This is in more
reasonable agreement with the experimental data [(DP*/DP)1/2 ∼ 4.5]. The tendency
for QACs to migrate as aggregates is supported by the observation
that QACs with different molecular masses (sizes) exhibit almost identical
migration kinetics (Figure 7): aggregate composition would be determined statistically,
and, thus, the variation in their molecular weights would be smaller
than the variation in the molecular weights of individual QACs. The
aggregation of QACs may also help to rationalize the complex character
of the QAC migration curves observed for the Arquad 2HT-75 positive
control film. Attempts to compare these experimental data to eq 1 were unsuccessful (Supporting
Information, Figure S6), because the functional
forms are quite different. In the positive control film, the “free”
QAC concentration is substantially higher because of the absence of
clay platelets, and it has been noted that as the QAC concentration
increases in nonpolar media, the formation of higher-order aggregates
may be implicated.51 A mixture of different
sized aggregates, not to mention the possibility of blooming (phase
separation) and other interfacial effects that may occur at such high
QAC concentrations, would result in complex migration curves.

Impact
of Simulant Chemistry on QAC Migration
Due to
poor solubility of the tallow-derived QACs in the polar aqueous phase,
it was anticipated that migration into aqueous (100% water), alcoholic
(10% ethanol in water), and acidic (3% acetic acid in water) food
simulants would be negligible, and this is borne out in the experimental
data (Table 3). No
QACs could be quantified in the 10 day, 40 °C samples for any
of these food simulants, suggesting that significant QAC exposure
is only likely when CPNs are in prolonged contact with fatty/oily
foods. Note that quality-control (QC) samples (Arquad 2HT-75 dissolved
in simulant) performed alongside migration tests exhibited low recovery
rates in simulants containing significant amounts of water. Rinsing
the QC sample vials with 100% ethanol and including the rinses in
the QC analysis resulted in recovery rates in excess of 90% (Supporting
Information, Table S8), suggesting that
QACs adhere to the container walls in the presence of aqueous simulants.
There was some concern that the lack of measurable QAC concentrations
in the experimental samples may have been due a similar phenomenon.
Applying similar rinsing steps to the aqueous simulants stored in
the presence of OMMT-containing film samples, however, still resulted
in no quantifiable QAC migration, reaffirming that the lack of quantifiable
QACs in the aqueous simulants is due to slow migration, not an experimental
artifact.

The values in parentheses represent standard deviations of three independent
replicates. Samples with reported values after a less than “<”
symbol had at least one replicate with a concentration below the limit
of quantitation (LOQ). The reported value was determined by assuming
the concentration in these replicates was equal to the LOQ value and
then calculating the mean across the replicates; an upper limit to
the migration is implied by this result.

Impact of OMMT Concentration and Temperature on QAC Migration
Experimental migration data in ethanol for the series of CPNs with
Cloisite 20 content ranging from 1 to 7 wt % are plotted in Figure 9, and the data are
tabulated in the Supporting Information, Table S6. Although it is generally observed that the amount of QACs
released increases as the initial Cloisite 20 concentration in the
films increases, the trend is not exactly linear. Initially, it was
thought that the deviations from linearity may be due to unavoidable
film-to-film variations in the manufacturing processes (e.g., the
cooling rate of the melt), which could impact critical parameters
like crystallinity that affect polymer permeability. However, a second
completely independent series of films (series II, red line) shows
almost an identical relationship between Cloisite 20 content and potential
exposure to QACs. We note that our extensive characterization data
showed that the degree of MMT interplatelet spacing, polymer crystallinity,
and both platelet and crystallite orientation relative to the polymer
machine direction changes in complex ways as the amount of clay content
increases, and each of these factors can play significant and often
conflicting roles in determining the macroscopic barrier properties.52 Additionally, a swell test using thermogravimetric
analysis (100 °C hold for 20 min) to monitor absorbed ethanol
loss showed that although neat LDPE absorbed a negligible amount of
ethanol (<0.1 wt %) during 40 °C storage conditions, the presence
of 21 wt % PE-g-MA in LDPE enabled the polymer to
absorb up to 1.1 wt % ethanol. Although the degree of swelling in
PE-g-MA-containing LDPE is small, it may contribute
to non-negligible changes in the permeability of the host polymer
to migrating QACs. These various complex relationships are likely
responsible for the trends observed in Figure 7, but more systematic study will be needed
to decouple the role of the clay dispersion characteristics and host
matrix polarity/permeability in determining QAC migration levels.

Figure 9 Total
mass of QACs migrated from Cloisite 20/PE-g-MA/LDPE
films, per unit film mass, as a function of the initial
Cloisite 20 mass percentage, after storage for 10 days at 40 °C.
The mass ratio of Cloisite 20 to PE-g-MA was 1:3.
The total QAC migration is the sum of the masses of migrated QACs
having molecular weights of 550.6, 522.6, 494.6, and 466.5 g mol–1, divided by the initial film mass. The red and blue
lines represent data acquired from experiments using two completely
different sets of PNC films, which have been called series I and series
II. Error bars along the y-axis and x-axis direction represent, respectively, standard deviations from
the mean migrated total QAC mass (n = 3) and from
the mean initial Cloisite 20 content in the films (n = 3).

The impact of temperature on the
QAC release from two independent
5 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE films was also investigated.
For both CPNs investigated (one from series I and one from series
II), the amount of QAC migration increased exponentially with temperature,
as expected from an Arrhenius-type process (Supporting Information, Figure S8).

Conclusions
This
study found that QACs migrated from LDPE-based CPNs into a
fatty food simulant (100% ethanol) under simulated long-term storage
conditions. For the CPN incorporating 7 wt % organically modified
clay, the amount of migrated QACs of varying molecular weights was
on the order of 1.12 ± 0.10 μg mg–1 of
the polymer into 100 mL of the simulant with a contact area of 27.7
cm2. The migrated QACs represented only a small (<10%)
fraction of the total QACs initially added to CPNs as components of
organically modified clay filler. Evidently, most of the QACs are
irreversibly bound to the embedded clays and are not available for
migration, a fact that was verified by aggressive extraction tests
into ethanol from the neat OMMT powder. The amount of migrated QACs
scaled with both temperature and the initial clay concentration added
to the CPNs. These trends were complex and likely influenced by such
factors as the crystallinity of the polymer phase, the dispersion
characteristics of embedded clay particles, the amount of PE-g-MA co-compatibilizer added, and the processing parameters
(e.g., melt temperature and spooling conditions). Additional work
will be needed to disentangle the influence of these parameters on
the mass transport. Negligible QACs were found to migrate from CPNs
into acidic, aqueous, and alcoholic simulants due to the poor solubility
of QACs in these solvents.

Migration tests are expensive and
technically challenging, so it
is often desirable to be able to estimate, rather than experimentally
measure, potential exposure to new food contact substances. Mathematical
models currently employed for this purpose usually incorporate a safety
margin to ensure that the projected migration is likely to be less
than the experimental migration. Because CPNs are complex biphasic
materials that possess attenuated molecular diffusion rates, it was
a prime goal of this work to evaluate whether migration models commonly
used to predict exposure to food contact substances from conventional
polymers also provide a similarly conservative estimate of exposure
to additives incorporated in these novel materials.

In the case
of the CPNs studied here, the experimental migration
was less than any migration projection that was made. A summary of
these results for the C18–C18 QAC is shown in Table 4. The crudest estimate was achieved
by assuming all of the QAC initially present in the film ends in the
food simulant (100% migration), but this approach overestimated the
exposure by a factor of nearly 25. Refinements to the model, such
as accounting for the fact that at least 90% of QACs is bound irreversibly
to clay platelets, provides a more accurate, but still conservative,
exposure assessment. Interestingly, the use of a diffusion coefficient
determined by a common semiempirical method and the default partition
coefficient used in migration models for migrants very soluble in
the food simulant (KP,F = 1) did not improve
the accuracy of the migration model compared to simply assuming 100%
migration of the free QAC fraction. This is because the predicted
diffusion coefficient DP* is over three orders of magnitude larger
than the experimental diffusion coefficient DP, which ensures that equilibrium is more or less reached by
the 10 day time point, and at equilibrium, the migration approaches
100% when the simulant volume is large. The discrepancy between the
diffusion constant determined by a fit of the experimental data to
the Fick’s Second Law solution (DP) and that estimated from the QAC molecular weight (DP*) was speculated
to be due to the aggregation of QACs in the hydrophobic polymer phase.
This finding implies that QAC migration in these materials may be
non-Fickian, particularly when the concentration is very high, and
additional factors, such as surface blooming, may play a role in mass
transfer dynamics.

Despite the complexity of clay/polymer
materials and the ionic
nature of QACs, migration models are satisfactorily conservative for
the CPNs evaluated in this study. Of course, because CPNs differ markedly
in their composition, crystallinity, and other properties, it will
be necessary to study additional examples to be confident that these
findings are broadly applicable to this class of materials. We stress
that the experiments described in this study were not intended to
provide any conclusion on the potential toxicological or health impact
of polymer-embedded clays or associated tallow-derived QACs that may
come into contact with foods. All food contact materials in the U.S.
market must be reviewed for safety and approved by the FDA under the
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

grade has a molecular weight of ∼ 8 × 104 g
mol–1. Poly(ethylene) grafted with maleic anhydride
(PE-g-MA) (product # 456632, batch # MKBK3735V and
MKBV7760V) was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cloisite 20 (lot
# 5102006) was acquired from BYK Additives and Instruments. As reported
by the manufacturer, the nominal water content of Cloisite 20 is <3%,
the density is 1.77 g cm–3, and the interplatelet
spacing (d001 value) is 3.16 nm. Arquad
2HT-75 (lot# BCBT6127 and BCBC0749V) was purchased from Millipore-Sigma.
An analysis of a pure solution of the Arquad 2HT-75 revealed that
it is ∼79% QACs by weight based on recovery values, the remainder
being water and inorganic material (e.g., chloride counterion and
other salts).

Solvents and Other Chemicals
Optima
grade acetic acid
used for the simulant media and Optima LC/MS grade acetonitrile, acetic
acid, water, isopropanol, methanol, and ammonium acetate for MS analysis
was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc. (Fair Lawn, New Jersey).
Dimethylsulfoxide (spectranalyzed grade) and glacial acetic acid (ACS
grade) were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc. Dimethyldioctadecylammonium
bromide (96% purity) was purchased from TCI Chemicals (Portland, OR).
Ethanol (99.5% purity, ACS reagent grade) and benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium
chloride (BDMHD-Cl, assay 97% minimum, 10% water weight maximum) were
purchased from Acros Organics (New Jersey). All water was deionized
to 18.2 MΩ cm and dispensed from a Millipore-Sigma MilliQ Direct
Q3 water purification system. BDMHD stock solutions (1000 ppb) were
made by accurately weighing 61.10 mg of neat BDMHD-Cl in a 50 mL class
A volumetric flask and diluting to the mark.

Film Manufacture
A DSM Xplore microcompounder with
a volume capacity of 15 mL was used to mix the organically modified
MMT (OMMT) with the polymer melt and form free-standing cast films.
The microcompounder is a scaled-down version of a conical co-rotating
twin-screw extruder fitted with a 65 mm cast film extrusion die. A
valve controls the flow of the polymer melt to either a recirculation
channel within the mixing chamber or an exit channel.

OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE films were prepared using a two-stage masterbatch
process. The first stage involved the dispersion of OMMT powder into
the grafted polymer compatibilizer (PE-g-MA); the
mass ratio of OMMT to PE-g-MA was 1:3. The second
stage involved dilution of the masterbatch into neat LDPE. The OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE melt was extruded to form CPN films with varying
concentrations of OMMT in LDPE with identical OMMT/PE-g-MA mass ratios. Films containing Arquad 2HT-75/PE-g-MA/LDPE, as well as negative control films with PE-g-MA and LDPE only, were prepared directly using a single-stage process.
Detailed fabrication procedures for all materials are provided in
the Supporting Information section, including tabulated information
on amounts of components added (Table S1) and nominal compositions (Table S2).

Film Characterization
The CPNs and other materials
were fully characterized prior to conducting migration tests. The
wt % of clay and other components was determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). Melting points were determined by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). Crystallinity values were determined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD). Clay dispersion characteristics were further evaluated by scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Fourier-transform infrared
attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. A full account
of the instrumentation and procedures used in these analyses is provided
in the Supporting Information.

Migration Tests
Disks (42 mm diameter) were removed
from sample film rolls with a steel punch, hammer, and cutting board.
Film thickness was measured at 3 points on each disk with a digital
micrometer to the nearest 0.1 μm. The disk weight was measured
on an analytical balance to the nearest 0.01 mg.

Migration tests
were conducted in four food simulants under time/temperature conditions
recommended by FDA for the preparation of premarket submission for
food contact substances.35 A large portion
of the tests was performed with 100% ethanol as a fatty food simulant.
Ethanol was used in lieu of a purified food oil due to the difficulty
of extracting the QACs from food oils for chemical analysis. This
substitution is supported by the FDA Guidance and numerous experimental
evaluations on the use of ethanol in migration testing.53,54

For the migration tests on neat LDPE, 7 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE and 4 wt % Arquad/PE-g-MA/LDPE
films, the
disks were placed in 125 mL glass jars with PTFE-lined screw-caps.
The food simulant (100 mL) was added to the jar, and the caps were
screwed-on tightly. The jars containing film disks and solvent were
placed on a Thermo Max Q4000 shaker set to 100 RPM shaking and a temperature
of 40 °C. At time intervals of 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168,
240, 485, and 696 h, the jars were removed from the shaker and placed
in a cool water bath for approximately 10 min before sampling. This
procedure was used for each of the four food simulants (in a preliminary
experiment used for the method development, ethanol-based samples
were stored in a circulating laboratory oven at 75 °C; all other
kinetic experiments were performed at 40 °C, as outlined above.)
Equivalent volumes of the simulants spiked with Arquad 2HT-75 and
stored under identical conditions served as quality-control (QC) samples.

For the migration tests of 5 wt % OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE
into 100% ethanol at different temperatures and OMMT/PE-g-MA/LDPE samples with different wt % of OMMT, the circular film sections
were stored in 25 mL glass crimp-top vials. The ethanol volume for
these samples was 20 mL. Crimp-top vials were used to reduce evaporation
of ethanol during storage at 66 °C. These samples were agitated
daily by hand. After storage for the appropriate time period, the
samples were cooled for approximately 10 min before decrimping and
sampling.

Quantitative measurement of the QAC concentrations
in food simulants
was carried out by flow-injection mass spectrometry (FI-MS; Acquity-TQD,
Waters Corporation) using a published method.46 The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 5 μg L–1 in the solution. A brief description of sampling methods and instrument
run parameters is provided in the Supporting Information. High-resolution mass spectra of QAC mixtures were acquired on a
ThermoFisher Exactive Plus Orbitrap in the positive ion mode using
the same mobile phase as the FI-MS analysis of migration samples.
