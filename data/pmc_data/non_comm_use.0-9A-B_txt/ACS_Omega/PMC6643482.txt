5-Hydroxymethylfurfural
(5-HMF) can be considered a prominent building
block: because of the presence of the alcohol and aldehyde moieties,
it can be used to generate useful molecules as chemicals of industrial
interest with high added value, monomers for polymers, and even fuels.
This article shows how building up mixed oxides of different complexities
and properties may drive the selectivity toward one of the possible
products generated from 5-HMF. In particular, mixed oxides based on
cerium and other metals abundant on the earth-crust perform the selective
oxidation of 5-HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran (94%), using oxygen as oxidant
and water as solvent. The roles of the reaction conditions (temperature,
reaction time, oxygen pressure, concentration of the substrate), the
chemical composition, the acidic/basic properties, and redox properties
of the catalysts are discussed.

1 Introduction
About 90% of synthetic
organic materials used in everyday life
are derived from oil. Replacement of fossil carbon with second-generation
biomass (cellulose) is a key factor in boosting the sustainability
of the chemical industry,1 as it avoids
fossil-CO2 emission and provides a diversity of raw materials.2 The challenging task is to develop new catalysts
that may selectively convert cellulose-derived polyols into useful
products.3 Particular attention has been
received by 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) (Figure 1), used as the source of several products,
each with peculiar properties. We have recently developed a process
for the production of pure 5-HMF4,5 used for the selective
synthesis of each of the products shown in Figure 1.6,7 Among the products of
oxidation of the pending arms of 5-HMF, particular attention has been
received by FDCA (1,5-furandicarboxylic acid) as it has been used
as co-monomer with etheneglycol for the production of poly(ethenefuranoate)
as substitute for poly-ethene terephthalate originated from oil.8

Figure 1 Products of side-chain oxidation of 5-HMF.

2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) (Figure 1) is another platform molecule, from which
fine chemicals
and drugs can be derived.9 Usually, DFF
is synthesized in organic solvents,10 because
of its scarce stability in water in the presence of bases, using precious
(gold) or expensive metals, such as ruthenium. Of the selectivity,
64.2% was achieved with 30.2% conversion, using as catalyst Cu/Cr/V-doped
MnO2 in the presence of oxygen as oxidant, carrying out
the synthesis in organic solvents.11 Even
organic co-catalysts, such as N-hydroxyphthalimide,
have been used with metal systems to produce DFF starting from 5-HMF
in organic solvents.12 Recently, double-layered
hydroxides of formula Mn0.70Cu0.05Al0.25OH, with not fully disclosed structural features, have been reported
to efficiently produce DFF in water.13

We have studied the selective oxidation of 5-HMF using oxygen and
water under nondrastic conditions and developed specialized catalysts
for the various products. Formyl-furan-carboxylic acid (FFCA) was
produced using CuO and CeO2 as catalysts.14 The selective oxidation to HMFCA (2-hydroxymethyl-furan-5-carboxylic
acid) was achieved using the mixed oxide MgO·CeO2.15 The selective formation of FDCA was
achieved using quaternary mixed oxides made of CuO–MnO2 and CeO2.16

In
this article, the selective aerobic oxidation of 5-HMF to DFF
will be discussed, putting emphasis on how combining binary oxides,
each not quite selective toward DFF, it is possible to build up a
catalytic material which produces DFF with over 90% selectivity and
almost total conversion of 5-HMF in water. Noteworthily, in the literature,
promoting preferentially the oxidation of the alcoholic functional
group of 5-HMF over the aldehydic is reported to add external bases.
In our case, the basicity of the mixed oxides is controlled by tuning
the nb/na ratio
(basic to acidic strong sites molar ratio), avoiding, thus, the use
of external bases. This makes the reactive system simpler and produces
less waste.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Single
Oxides: Assessment of the Catalytic
Activity
Binary oxides of available elements on the Earth
crust, such as MgO, MnO2, and CeO2, have been
used. Their choice was dictated by our previous experience.14−16 In a first stage of the work, the catalytic activity of the single
oxides was estimated. Table 1 shows the activity of various catalysts (single oxides) used
in the oxidation of 5-HMF in the presence of O2. We have
already reported14 that by using CeO2 (Table 1,
entry 1) the main oxidation product is FFCA. MnO2, a stronger
oxidant, gives FDCA as the main (75.5%) oxidation product, accompanied
by 23.5% of FFCA and a minute amount of levulinic acid (LA) (Table 1, entry 2). MgO is
not a redox catalyst but is used in mixed oxides for tuning their
basic properties: by using MgO alone, formic acid (FA) and humins
were detected because of thermal 5-HMF decomposition (Table 1, entry 3).

MPa.

b Not effective at 383
K. At T > 403 K, degradation products were formed.
LA is levulinic
acid.

MnO2 has
the drawback of its water solubility that makes
it not appropriate as a heterogeneous catalyst: EDX (Energy Dispersive
X-rays) measurements did show that 75% of the original solid was dissolved
in water.

2.2 Characterization of the Single Oxides
Table 2, entries 1–3,
reports the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area and the
ratio between (weak and strong) acid and (weak and strong) basic sites
for single oxides. The latter were calculated from the NH3/CO2 thermo-desorption curves. The strength of different
basic/acidic sites is categorized as:17(i) weakly basic because of the presence
of hydroxyl groups on the surface; the desorption occurs in the range
of 290–430 K;

(ii) Medium basic attributed to the M=O
moieties; the desorption occurs in the range of 430–670 K;

(iii) Strong basic because
of isolated
oxide species; the desorption occurs above 670 K.

As the weak acid/basic
sites do not have an active role in catalysis,
in this work we have considered only basic sites with medium and strong
properties. Analogously, acidity is classified as weak (because of
the protons of the surface OH-functionalities) and strong acidity
(Lewis acid metals, Mn+).18

Table 2 shows that
the single oxides have different acidic/basic properties. In our previous
studies, we have correlated the “ratio of strong basic/acidic
sites (nb/na)” to the activity of the catalysts used and, in part, for
tuning their activity and selectivity, supposed that the mixed oxides
had the correct potential for the targeted oxidation.14−16 Looking at Table 2, it is clear that depending on the single oxides used different
products are obtained: CeO2 affords mainly FFCA, MnO2 affords FDCA as the majoritary product, but, as said earlier
has the drawback that it dissolves in water under the reaction conditions.
MgO is not able to produce any selective oxidation of the arms of
5-HMF and only affords destructive ring oxidation to FA. Therefore,
none of the oxides affords DFF, the product of selective oxidation
of the alcoholic arm of 5-HMF, in good yield. Such properties are
visualized in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Ratio nb/na and oxidation capacity of single oxides.

The BET surface area (Table 2, entries 1–3) varies in the order MgO <
MnO2 < CeO2 and the trend is not correlated
to the
specific activity of the catalysts, as also shown by other authors.19

The H2-Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) (Figure 3) shows a profile
associated to the different redox property of the single oxides: CeO2 shows a reduction peak at a much higher temperature than
MnO2. A low reduction temperature implies a higher O-transfer
potential: MnO2 is a better oxidant than CeO2. MgO does not show any reduction peak in a reasonable temperature
range, as expected. Table 1 shows that single oxides do not promote high (>90%) selectivity
toward any of the oxidation products of 5-HMF. However, we have synthesized
various mixed oxides so as to have stable heterogeneous catalysts
capable of enhancing the selectivity toward DFF.

MnO2 (blue line).

2.3 Evaluation of the Activity of the Ternary
Mixed Oxides
To avoid misunderstandings, it is worth to emphasize
that the IUPAC Nomenclature (2005) was used for the definition of
binary, ternary, or quaternary oxide. Therefore, considering the number
of different elements, an oxide of the type MO and M2O
is named binary, MM′O is a ternary oxide, and so on.

Table 3 shows the
analytical data (theoretical and experimental) of the mixed oxides
used. The BET surface area and the strength of the acid and base sites
are shown in Table 2 (entries 4–7). As we have already reported, when CuO·CeO2 is used as catalyst14 5-HMF is
converted with high selectivity (90%) to produce FFCA at 99% conversion,
whereas MgO·CeO215 shows
a high selectivity toward HMFCA (97%) and the quaternary oxide CuO·MnO2·CeO2 affords FDCA with >90% selectivity
at
a total conversion of 5-HMF.16

Mixed Oxides

2	MgO·MnO2·CeO2	18.35	46.80	8.11	17.99	46.25	8.74	
Considering the above evidence, we
have investigated first the
behavior of MnO2·CeO2, and then of MgO·MnO2·CeO2. The activity and selectivity of the
used catalysts were evaluated considering the influence of different
parameters such as the dependence on the oxygen pressure, the temperature,
and the initial concentration of 5-HMF. Furthermore, the effect of
the calcination temperature was also evaluated.

2.4 Influence of Calcination Temperature on the
Activity of MnO2·CeO2
MnO2·CeO2 was calcined at different temperatures
such as 723, 823, and 923 K and then was used as catalyst in the oxidation
of 5-HMF (Figure 4).
The analyses of the liquid phase were carried out after 3 h (plateau).
As Figure 4 shows,
the DFF yield was increased by 10 times with respect to single binary
oxides (see Table 1) and was maximized with the solid calcined at 825 K. As reported
in Figure 5, it is
clear that the calcination temperature affects the ratio of acid/basic
sites and the increase of temperature favors the acidity. As a matter
of fact, most acidic catalysts (Mn/Ce)923K produce FA.20 Considering the value of the nb/na of MnO2·CeO2, we decided to modulate its properties by adding a basic
oxide to it in order to increase the ratio nb/na and try to promote the oxidation
of the alcoholic functionality of 5-HMF. MgO was selected as the third
oxide.

Figure 4 Oxidation of 5-HMF: comparison of the activity of CeO2·MnO2 mixed oxide calcined at different temperatures.

Figure 5 Change of the acidic/basic sites for MnO2·CeO2 with the change of the calcination temperature.
The Y-axis gives the strong absorption of NH3 or
CO2 as mL/gcat. Increasing the temperature of
calcination causes a decrease of nb/na from 0.57 to 0.13.

2.5 Evaluation of the Activity of the Quaternary
Mixed Oxide MgO·MnO2·CeO2
Table 4 (entries 1
and 2) shows the results relevant to the use of a quaternary mixed
oxide in catalysis. As a comparison, we report the data relevant to
the quaternary oxide CuO·MnO2·CeO2.16 The MgO-based quaternary oxide MgO·MnO2·CeO2 afforded 94.9% selectivity toward DFF
at a conversion close to 70% (entry 1) after 6 h of reaction and 98.8%
conversion at 95.2% selectivity after 10 h. The CuO-based quaternary
oxide produced mainly FDCA.16Table 4 clearly shows the
effect of a third oxide on the couple MnO2·CeO2: whereas the basic oxide MgO addresses the reaction toward
the oxidation of the −CH2OH moiety that is converted
into the −CHO moiety, such effect was expected as the basic
conditions to favor the deprotonation of the alcoholic moiety and
its oxidation; the addition of CuO, an oxidant, promotes the complete
oxidation of both pending arms of 5-HMF into the carboxylic group–CO2H. It worth to emphasize that a maximum temperature of 383
K was used in the case of the MgO·MnO2·CeO2 (see the following paragraph for explanation). Table 4 shows the product distribution
at two different times of reaction. Noteworthily, the further oxidation
of the formyl moieties was not observed with the MgO·MnO2·CeO2 quaternary catalyst even at longer reaction
times.

2.6 Characterization of the Quaternary Mixed Oxide
MgO·MnO2·CeO2 before and after Catalysis
We have investigated how the properties of the quaternary oxide
are affected during catalysis. At the end of the catalytic test, the
catalyst was separated by filtration from the reaction mixture and
washed with distilled water (2 × 3 mL) and dried in vacuo at
370 K. The ratio nb/na and the value of BET are not affected (variation of
1%) by the use in catalysis. The recovered catalysts were analyzed
by EDX and leaching of metals was not observed.

H2-TPR analysis of the mixed oxides was performed to understand how
the properties of the starting oxides were modified in the mixed oxides.
It is interesting to note that, considering the quaternary mixed oxide
MgO·MnO2·CeO2, one can find that even
if MgO does not present a reduction peak in a reasonable temperature
range, it influences the redox properties of the ternary MnO2·CeO2 oxide. The profile (Figure 6) shows that the two reduction peaks for
Mn/Ce are shifted and collapse into one: most probably, the quaternary
oxide shows higher oxidizing power comparing with binary and ternary
oxides with a boosted oxidation of 5-HMF toward DFF. The basic properties
of MgO play a key role in this catalytic material.

2.7 Recyclability of the Catalysts
In
order to clarify whether catalysis occurred on the solid catalyst
or in solution, the reaction solution was filtered and the liquid
phase characterized for its composition. Metals were not detected
if not at a sub-trace concentration (ppm level). Such solution was
anyway used in a separate experiment of oxidation in the same conditions
used with the solid catalysts. No oxidation of 5-HMF was observed.
If the quaternary catalyst was added, 5-HMF was oxidized. This clarifies
that catalysis is really heterogeneous. We have also investigated
how the catalytic run influences the properties of the catalyst by
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique and we have carried out measures before and after
the catalytic test. As a general procedure, after each step, the autoclave
was cooled down and opened to recover the quaternary catalyst. This
latter was filtered, washed with distilled water (3 × 5 mL),
dried in vacuo at 323 K, and analyzed by XPS and XRD. Then, they were
calcined at 823 K and re-used with fresh samples of the substrate.
The recovery process was carried out several times. Figure 7 illustrates the test performed
using MgO·MnO2·CeO2 that was, thus,
obtained in almost quantitative yield with respect to the starting
catalyst.

Figure 7 Recyclability of MgO·MnO2·CeO2 oxide:
after three runs at 403 K, the conversion (blue bar) drops to one-third
of the original value, with DFF being the preferred product. At 383
K, a higher stability is observed over several runs (see text).

A decrease of the activity of
the catalyst was observed when the
tests were performed using Mg/Mn/Ce at 403 K. After the third run,
the conversion (blue bar) was heavily decreased, whereas DFF selectivity
remained high (purple bar). The EDX analysis after the run revealed
leaching of Mg as Mg(OH)2, and the increase of the ratio
Ce/Mg from 5.3 to 6.8.

It is worth to note that when the catalytic
test was performed
at 383 K, the catalyst maintained its activity, stability, and selectivity
for a long time as leaching was prevented. In fact, the recovered
catalyst when re-used in the oxidation of 5-HMF in two more runs gave
the following results: conversion: 99, 98.8%; selectivity: 95; 96.1%,
respectively, for run 2 and run 3.

3 Conclusions
In this article, we have shown that 5-HMF can be converted into
DFF, a platform molecule derived from biomass, with high yield (up
to 99%) and selectivity (95%) in aqueous phase under external base-free
conditions with oxygen as oxidant and in the presence of the quaternary
mixed oxide of formula MgO·MnO2·CeO2. The catalyst at 403 K underwent leaching after the third run. At
383, the stability was much increased and the catalyst performed well
for several runs. Catalysis occurs on the solid catalyst and best
operative conditions are represented by [5-HMF]o = 0.015
M; PO2 = 2 MPa, T = 383 K. The use of the basic component of the catalyst has a key
role in the reaction path and selectivity of the process. In fact,
it favors the deprotonation of the alcoholic functionality of 5-HMF,
improving the H-transfer from such group with respect to the formyl
group, avoiding the formation of carboxylic moiety. It is worth to
point out that the conversion of bio-based 5-HMF into DFF with high
yields in the absence of a base using heterogeneous systems is an
example of a sustainable and ecofriendly process.

4 Materials and Methods
All reagents were ACS grade Sigma-Aldrich
products. 5-HMF was obtained
as described in ref (5).

A high-energy milling (HEM) apparatus Pulverisette 7 Fritsch
was
used to prepare the catalysts.

To measure the 5-HMF conversion
kinetics at a fixed temperature,
a 50 mL stainless-steel reactor equipped with a valve to pick up the
sample at a fixed time and an electrical heating jacket was used.

The conversion of 5-HMF and formation of its derivatives were monitored
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Jasco PU-2089 PLUS)
connected to a Refractive Index (RI) detector. The following HPLC
analysis conditions were used: Phenomenex Rezex RHM Monosaccharide
H+ (8%), 300 × 7.8 mm, 343 K (column); 0.005 N solution
of sulphuric acid (mobile phase); 0.5–0.9 mL/min (flow rate).
Gas chromatography analyses were carried out with Thermo Scientific
equipment by using the following conditions: 323 K (2 min)—7°/min
→ 393 K (8 min)—15°/min → 403 (10 min).

Quantitative oxides analyses were performed by using a Shimadzu
EDX-720/800 HS (5–50 kV Rh target X-ray generator, Si (Li)
detecting system). The analyses were carried out at room temperature
and N2 liquid was used to cool the detector.

A scanning
microprobe PHI 5000 VersaProbe II (Physical Electronics,
Chanhassen, MN) connected with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray
radiation source was used to perform XPS analyses. The registered
high-resolution spectra (Fixed Analyser Transmission (FAT) mode, pass
energy 29.35 eV) were processed by using the MultiPak software package
(version 9.6.1.7).

The measurement of the specific surface area
was performed with
BET technique by using a Micromeritics Chemisorb 2750 equipment. NH3 and CO2 were used as probe gas with 100 mg of
catalyst (pretreated under 30 mL min–1 N2 flow at 823 K) to analyze the acid and basic sites, respectively.
In all the experiments, He was used as carrier gas (30 mL min–1).

The structure of the catalysts was studied
recording powder X-ray
diffraction patterns at room temperature using a Bruker D8-DISCOVER
[Bruker AXS., Karlsruhe, Germany] powder diffractometer connected
with a Göbel Mirror for Cu Kα radiation (λKα1 = 1.54056 Å and λKα2 =
1.54439 Å). The analysis conditions were 40 kV and 50 mA; data
were collected in the 2θ range between 10° and 120°,
with a 0.05° step size and a counting time of 1 s per step, with
2θ/ω scan type.

4.1 Catalyst Preparation
4.1.1 Synthesis of MnO2·CeO2
(NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (1 mmol, 0.54
g) and 0.08 g of MnO2 (1 mmol) were
placed in agate baskets and pulverized in the planetary mill using
the following programme: 790 rpm × 15 min with a 1 min break
for a total of 1 h and repetition inverting the rotation sense. The
black collected powder was calcined for 3 h at 723–923 K. The
solid was then cooled down into a desiccator and transferred into
a test tube and preserved under N2 atmosphere to avoid
any kind of decomposition of the catalyst prior to its use. The data
for the elemental analysis carried out by EDX are shown in Table 3.

4.1.2 Synthesis of MgO·MnO2·CeO2
An equivalent amount of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (1 mmol; 0.54 g), manganese(IV) oxide
(1 mmol; 0.08 g), and the nitrate of the desired metal (1 mmol) were
mixed and pulverized using HEM, calcined, and stored as described
above (a). The data for the elemental analysis carried out by EDX
are shown in Table 3.

4.2 Catalytic Tests and Product Analysis
A solution of 5-HMF (1 mmol, 0.126 g) in deionized water (7 mL) was
prepared in a glass reactor, where 0.05 g of the catalyst under study
and a magnetic stirrer were also added. The glass reactor was placed
into a stainless-steel autoclave that was closed, purged three times
with O2, charged at the proper O2 pressure,
and heated to the specific reaction temperature (see the Results and Discussion section). The reaction was
followed by sampling the reaction mixture at fixed intervals of time
and monitoring, by HPLC, the disappearance of 5-HMF. In this way,
the reaction could be stopped when the concentration of 5-HMF remained
constant or even approached zero. At the end of the reaction, the
autoclave was opened, the reaction mixture recovered and extracted
with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (3 × 7 mL). This operation was useful
to recover the formed DFF which is not very soluble in water and can
precipitate. The EtOAc solutions were collected, washed with water
to extract 5-HMF dissolved into it, desiccated with Na2SO4, filtered, and analyzed by GC. Evaporation in vacuum
of EtOAc gave the pure DFF (98% yield).
