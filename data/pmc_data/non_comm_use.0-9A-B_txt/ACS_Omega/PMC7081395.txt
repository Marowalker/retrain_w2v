The main objective of this study
is to evaluate the effect of the
textural properties and surface chemical nature of silica nanoparticles
obtained from different synthesis routes and silicon precursors, on
their interactions with asphaltenes and further viscosity reduction
of heavy crude oil (HO). Four different SiO2 nanoparticles
were used, namely, commercial fumed silica nanoparticles (CSNs) and
three in-house-synthesized nanoparticles (named based on the silicon
source) modifying the silicon precursor: sodium silicate (SNSS), tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS) (SNT), and rice husk (SNRH). The nanomaterials were characterized
through dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, N2 physisorption (SBET), atomic force microscopy
(AFM), and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption
of asphaltenes over the different nanoparticles was evaluated at a
concentration of 1000 mg·L–1 in toluene. The
asphaltene–nanoparticle interactions are closely related to
several textural properties, such as roughness, surface area, and
hydrodynamic diameter, as well as the surface chemical nature of the
materials. The results in the textural characterization exhibited
that the sizes of the nanoparticles from TEM ranged between 6.9 and
11.5 nm. Nevertheless, the standard deviation of the measurements
showed that the sizes are statistically similar. Inversely, the hydrodynamic
diameter changed, affecting the surface silanol group’s availability
due to a hindering effect on functional groups as the hydrodynamic
size of the material increased. The rheological measurements were
performed at a fixed nanoparticle dosage of 1000 mg·L–1 and showed that the trend of the degree of viscosity reduction (DVR)
was CSN > SNT > SNSS > SNRH with the highest value yielding
at 30%.
The results of DVR are in accordance with the nanoparticles’
adsorptive capacity as higher values were obtained with the material
that leads to a higher amount of adsorbed asphaltenes. Also, the oxygen
amount related to silanol groups, estimated by the XPS analysis, showed
a direct relation regarding adsorption capacity and further HO viscosity
reduction.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
most of the worldwide petroleum reserves are composed
of heavy oil (HO) and extra-heavy oil (EHO).1−3 Although there
is a wide availability of this type of reserves, the vast majority
of these remain underexploited due to the costs and technical challenges
associated with their production and transportation.4,5 The issues presented in these operations are related to the HO and
EHO physicochemical properties, particularly the viscosity, which
hinders the crude oil mobility at surface and subsurface conditions.6−10 It is well known that this reduced mobility is derived mainly from
the asphaltene contents11,12 and their interactions
with the other chemical compounds in the crude oil, which lead to
the formation of complex microstructures.13−19 Thus, different types of nanomaterials have been developed for capturing
asphaltenes through an adsorption phenomenon, inhibiting the aggregation
of these molecules. Different nanoparticles have been evaluated including
alumina,20−23 Fe3O4,24−29 silica,30−35 functionalized materials,22,36−39 and other oxides,20,40−43 which can modify the viscoelastic
networks of HO and EHO and hence reduce their viscosity.29,44

Silica nanoparticles are among the most used nanomaterials
for
these purposes due to their high affinity toward asphaltene adsorption.35 Cortés et al.36 evaluated SiO2 nanoparticles as support for nickel oxide
nanocrystals for improving their adsorption. The high affinity of
these composite materials for asphaltenes leads to the reduction of
asphaltene aggregate sizes, which in EHO and HO causes a reconfiguration
of the microstructure, decreasing the viscosity, and, thus, improving
the mobility.44,45 Taborda et al.44 evaluated the effect of nanoparticles and nanofluids on
the HO rheology and mobility, finding that the performance of viscosity
reduction is directly related to the nanoparticles’ adsorptive
capacity. The authors found that the best results are obtained using
acidized silica nanoparticles with a degree of viscosity reduction
(DVR) of 90% with dosages between 1000 and 10000 mg·L–1.

In further studies, Taborda et al.46,47 found that
the maximum HO viscosity reduction for the evaluated silica nanoparticles
was reached with a concentration near 1000 mg·L–1, with a DVR of roughly 52%. Also, Taborda et al.45 studied the mechanisms leading to HO viscosity reduction
through dynamic rheological tests, establishing that the crude oil
microstructure was altered upon nanoparticle addition, which reduced
the elastic contributions of the viscoelastic fluid after being subjected
to stress, suggesting a disruption in the asphaltene viscoelastic
network. The positive effects of silica nanoparticles on the crude
oil rheological properties and thus in their mobility have also been
evaluated for alternated benefits. Montes et al.48 evaluated the diluent/dispersant ratio for carrier fluid
designing and its synergistic process alongside silica nanoparticles.
The authors found that the viscosity reduction perdurability would
be enhanced with the nanoparticulated system with an increase in viscosity
of just 20% after 30 days compared with an increment of 80% after
10 days in the absence of nanoparticles.

Due to the high performance
of silica nanoparticles in capturing
asphaltenes on their surface, some authors have studied the effects
of different properties on the adsorption phenomenon according to
their nature in terms of the textural properties such as surface area,
particle size, and surface chemical composition.30,33,35,36,49−51 The different values of surface
areas with specific active site availability could substantially change
the effect of the sorbent and its impact on viscosity reduction. For
Poole et al.50 and Doner,49 the asphaltene surface attractive forces of silica nanoparticles
depend on properties such as low particle diameter, high surface area,
and available active sites, specifically Si–OH (silanol) groups
on the surface of nanoparticles, which have a great selectivity for
polar molecules.30 The presence of this
type of structure generates acid–base interactions with the
most polar compounds in HO N-containing functional groups such as
pyridine, quinolone, and pyrrole species.52−54

Furthermore,
recent studies30 aimed
at determining the role of particle size and surface acidity in the
asphaltene–silica nanoparticle interactions with nanomaterials
ranging from 11 to 240 nm. It was found that the lowest nanoparticle
size (S11) generated the highest asphaltene adsorption, which is related
to a higher surface area availability. Moreover, the surface of the
S11 nanoparticles was modified by acidizing (S11A) and basifying (S11B)
treatments, finding that the best performance was obtained with the
S11A material and is narrowly related to the generation of higher
amounts of hydroxyl (silanol) groups. Other authors have also found
that the surface availability of silanol groups has a significant
role in asphaltene–silica interactions.22,36 It is worth mentioning that the surface chemical nature and the
textural properties are the keys to the asphaltene adsorption phenomenon,
which in HO causes changes in its microstructure leading to viscosity
reduction.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are
no studies evaluating
the effects of different textural properties and surface chemical
nature of silica nanoparticles on the viscosity reduction of HO and
EHO based on different silicon sources and synthesis routes. Therefore,
the main objective of this study is to determine the effect of the
textural properties and surface chemical nature of silica nanoparticles
obtained from different sources and synthesis routes on their interactions
with asphaltenes and HO viscosity reduction. Thereby, distinct synthesis
routes and silicon precursors for obtaining silica nanoparticles were
used, ensuring a similar particle size and varying the roughness,
hydrodynamic diameter, and surface area, resulting in a change of
the surface silanol concentration and availability. It is expected
that this work will generate a wider landscape about the role of nanotechnology
to guarantee a cost-effective and better exploitation of heavy and
extra-heavy oils.

2 Results and Discussion
The results are divided into four sections, namely: (i) nanoparticle
characterization including the analysis of textural and surface chemical
nature, (ii) rheological behavior and asphaltene adsorption evaluation,
(iii) assessment of the effect of textural properties on viscosity
reduction, and (iv) effect of surface chemical composition of silica
nanoparticles on HO viscosity reduction.

2.1 Nanoparticle
Characterization
2.1.1 Textural Property Assessment
Figure 1 shows the
textural
characteristics of the four silica nanoparticles in terms of particle
size and visual roundness assessed through the high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) technique. It can be seen in Figure 1a,b that the silica
nanoparticles synthesized from rice husk (SNRH) and silica nanoparticles
synthesized from sodium silicate (SNSS) have an amorphous agglomerate
texture as Musić et al.55 and Ghorbani
et al.56 stated in their respective studies.
In contrast, commercial silica nanoparticle (CSN) and silica nanoparticles
synthesized from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) (SNT) present a spherical
and nonagglomerate shape as Stöber et al.57 suggested. Additionally, the nanoparticles’ mean
particle size was calculated through HR-TEM by analyzing the images
using ImageJ—Fiji software.58 In
brief, the images that were considered as a representative bulk sample
were selected, and a negative photographic image was generated. The
contrast and brightness were adjusted to improve the image quality,
and finally, after selecting the color target, the software reproduces
the nanoparticles’ size histogram. The obtained results are
shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 alongside the standard
deviation of the measured sizes. The results indicate that silica
nanoparticles are restrained in the range from 6.9 to 11.5 nm approximately,
and as observed from the standard deviation, the sample sizes are
statistically similar, as it is also shown in the box plot in Figure 2.59 The aforementioned fact was also validated with the skewness
and kurtosis values, which are shown in Table S1 of the Supporting information. It can be seen that the values
for both parameters tend to 0, and it can be established with sufficient
confidence that the particle size distribution is Gaussian, and thus
the standard deviation alone is adequate for stating that all of the
distributions are statistically similar.

Also, in Table 1 are
presented the BET surface area (SBET)
and mean particle size (dp50) results obtained by N2 physisorption and DLS analysis, respectively. It is observed
from Table 1 that SNSS
and CSN have the highest SBET values,
while the medium and low surface areas represent SNRH and SNT, respectively.
The four samples of silica evaluated are nonporous materials based
on the SBET values reported in Table 1. Moreover, the SNRH
sample has a higher hydrodynamic diameter compared to the one reported
with HR-TEM, which is mainly due to a higher aggregation of the nanoparticles
in the aqueous suspension used. This phenomenon affects the hydrodynamic
diameter of the nanomaterials according to the Stokes–Einstein
equation (eq 2), which
is used for DLS equipment for the indirect measurement of the hydrodynamic
diameter. In this sense, when the hydrodynamic diameter increases
for the nanoparticle cluster, the movement of nanoparticles is reduced
and then diffusivity also decreases.

Equation 2 is the
Stokes–Einstein equation,60 used
for determining the hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticles through
DLS measurements, where KB (1.98 ×
10–23 m2·kg·s–2·K–1) is the Boltzmann constant, T (K) is temperature, η (cP) is the viscosity of the medium,
and D (m2·s–1)
is the nanoparticle diffusion coefficient. It is observed that as
the diffusivity of the particles in the suspension decreases, the
hydrodynamic size increases (Table 1) 2  

Moreover, as the HR-TEM images just provide visual insights
on
the nanoparticles’ roundness or sphericity, the roughness of
the material was evaluated through AFM analysis, and its results are
also shown in Table 1. It is observed from these results that the roughness trend of the
nanomaterials is SNT > CSN > SNSS > SNRH. An example of the
analyzed
micrographs is observed in Figure 3, where the noncontact micrograph is visible, as well
as the high profiles and three-dimensional (3D) micrographs. Additional
information on the nanoparticles’ textural properties regarding
N2 adsorption isotherms and pore volume can be found in Figure S1 and Table S2 of the Supporting Information,
respectively.

2.1.2 Functional Groups and
Composition
The surface chemical composition of the silica
nanoparticles has
an important effect on the nanoparticle–asphaltenes interactions,30 which lead to viscosity reduction.44 Specifically, siloxane and silanol groups are
of primary importance for governing the adsorption process. A brief
scheme of the commonly found silanol and other Si–O functional
groups in the surface of the nanoparticles is shown in Figure 4, where Figure 4b–d are the structures corresponding
to silanol groups, while Figure 4a represents siloxane groups. To study the effect of
the chemical nature of nanoparticles on HO viscosity reduction, the
nanomaterial surfaces were properly characterized through Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
for determining composition changes and quantifying the presence of
both functional groups’ species.

nanoparticles: (a) siloxane, (b) isolated
silanol, (c) geminal silanols, and (d) associated silanols. Reproduced
with permission from Poole and Riffenburgh.61

Figure 5 shows the
FTIR spectra obtained for the evaluated nanoparticles. From Figure 5, the typical vibrations
of the siloxane and silanol groups can be observed in all of the nanomaterials.
The bands at around 750 and 810 cm–1 represent the
Si–O bond flection, and the wide band between 850 and 960 cm–1 corresponds to the O–Si–O stretching
vibrations. Moreover, the adjacently encountered band between 1000
and 1300 cm–1 denotes the same bonds’ asymmetric
stretching.62,63 On the other hand, the presence
of silanol groups is related to the band centered between 2500 and
3800 cm–1, which is produced by the O–H bond
vibrations. The band centered at 1600 cm–1 shows
hydroxyl scissoring.64 It can be also seen
from Figure 5 that
the bulk intensity of common silanol bands follows the order SNSS
> SNRH > CST > SNT. However, as the FTIR spectra correspond
to bulk
measurements, it is not enough for determining the tested nanomaterial’s
surface activity regarding the attractive forces between these and
asphaltene aggregates. In this sense, a more refined surface analysis
was carried out using the XPS technique.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra for commercial
silica nanoparticles (CSNs) and silica
nanoparticles synthesized from different sources: rice husk (SNRH),
sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT).

Figure 6 shows the
XP spectra, which were carried out for identifying the surface chemical
nature of the four nanoparticles evaluated. Figure 6A represents the survey spectra, in which
it is observed the presence of distinct elements in each nanoparticle
surface. The binding energy (BE) of carbon 1 (C 1s) was taken as a
reference value to perform spectra corrections, and the signals were
decomposed using Gaussian/Lorentzian combination functions. In Figure 6B, the O 1s high-resolution
spectra are shown, which schematizes the total surface oxygen in the
nanomaterials and its different chemical surroundings. The green area
corresponds to the silanol-group-related oxygen (SO, at around 533.7
eV of BE), while the blue one denotes the siloxane-group-related oxygen
(≈532.7 eV). It is important to clarify that Figure 6A shows peaks associated with
the presence of C 1s carbon, which is generated by adventitious carbon
and does not resemble the surface composition of the nanoparticles.

nanoparticles synthesized from different sources: rice husk (SNRH),

decomposed O 1s high-resolution spectra of the different nanomaterials,
where the signal in blue denotes the siloxane-related oxygen (≈532.7
eV), while the green one is associated with the silanols (≈533.7
eV).

It is also observed that SNRH
has sodium and sulfur presence at
the surface, which indicates the presence of sodium sulfate salt from
the synthesis route. The SNSS spectrum presents Cls and sodium characteristic
peaks, indicating the presence of sodium silicate in the sample and
chloride ions from sodium chloride used in its respective synthesis
process. It is also shown in Figure 6B that the curved area of the silanol on the surface
of the nanomaterials has the trend CSN > SNT > SNSS > SNRH.
Presumably,
the asphaltene–nanoparticle interaction forces would have a
similar tendency, as in the silanol groups, and the O–H bond
formed in this type of structure generates a delocalization of the
charge toward oxygen, due to the high difference of electronegativity
of these atoms, causing a greater interaction between these groups
with the polar components of the crude oil.65,66

Table 2 summarizes
the quantified amount of the different elements conforming each nanoparticle
surface as atomic percentages. The total surface oxygen by percentage
has the trend SNSS > SNT > SNRH > CSN. However, it is worth
mentioning
that these quantities are not related to surface SO enrichment, as
different synthesis processes could lead to distinct water chemisorption
degrees on the surface of the nanoparticles, which is narrowly related
to the presence of SO.67 A better approximation
could be obtained by calculating the O/Si ratios for each type of
nanomaterial. Nonetheless, there would be some overestimations related
to Si–O–Si structure existence. Hence, further analyses
were carried out by quantifying the normalized total oxygen conforming
the surface of the nanoparticles and calculating the SO contribution
from Figure 6B.

The
SO amount for each evaluated nanoparticle calculated from the
normalized total oxygen content in its surface is shown in Figure 7. It is seen that
unlike the previous analyses, the higher SO contribution was obtained
for the CSN, with a value yielding 100% of the total oxygen presented
in the nanoparticle surface, while the SNT, SNSS, and SNRH have contributions
of 90, 82, and 53%, respectively. This last analysis would suggest
that the CSN has a higher surface concentration of asphaltene–nanoparticle
interaction points, which may result in higher amounts of adsorbed
asphaltenes that generate further viscosity reduction.45,46 Nonetheless, the silanol active sites available on the surface of
the nanoparticles could change according to the nanomaterials’
textural properties such as surface area and hydrodynamic diameter.

Figure 7 Silanol-group-related
oxygen (SO) amount for commercial silica
nanoparticles (CSNs) and silica nanoparticles synthesized from different
sources: rice husk (SNRH), sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT)
calculated from the normalized total oxygen content on their surface.

Figure 8 shows the
influence of the nanoparticles’ textural properties on the
presence of SO on their surface in terms of their (A) surface area
and (B) the mean hydrodynamic diameter (dp50). No clear
trend is seen when comparing the surface area to the SO, as the SNSS
material, which has the highest surface area, does not have a vast
majority of surface silanol groups as the CNS does. This means that
the availability of this type of active sites is not necessarily related
to a higher area and would not lead automatically to higher adsorption.
On the contrary, a clear correlation is observed between the nanomaterials’
hydrodynamic diameter and the availability of the discussed active
sites, as a decrease in the dp50 value is related to an
increase in the SO. This latter fact could be associated with nanoparticle
agglomeration, as it suggests an important nanoparticle–nanoparticle
interaction, hindering the exposition of active sites for asphaltene–nanoparticle
interactions.

four different nanoparticles are commercial silica nanoparticles (CSNs)
and silica nanoparticles synthesized from different sources: rice
husk (SNRH), sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT).

2.2 Rheological Behavior and Asphaltene Adsorption
Evaluation
The effect of silica nanoparticles on HO rheological
behavior has been widely studied in previous works,44,46,47 where also the mechanisms governing viscosity
reduction have been explored.45 The most
important conclusions regarding these studies indicate that the asphaltene
adsorption over the surface of the nanoparticles leads to an aggregate
size reduction,33,44 producing a modification of the
fluid microstructure, which causes a viscoelastic network disruption.45 Moreover, although the effect of this phenomenon
caused by different nanoparticle surfaces’ chemical nature
has been evaluated, a proper analysis regarding the influence of nanoparticle’s
identified functional groups is yet to be carried out. In this sense, Figure 9 shows the flow curves
for the HO in the absence and presence of the studied nanoparticles
at a concentration of 1000 mg·L–1. The mentioned
dosage is in agreement with other studies, as it is close to the optimum
concentration for obtaining the best viscosity reduction performance.46−48Figure 9 shows the
typical pseudoplasticity of these types of fluids with a shear-thinning
behavior.11,68 Moreover, a viscosity reduction upon nanoparticle
addition to the HO is observed in all of the ranges of the shear rate
used for determining the samples’ rheological behavior. The
highest reduction was observed when using CSN, followed by SNT, SNSS,
and SNRH, which is in agreement with a higher silanol availability
on the surface of the nanoparticles.

Figure 9 Rheological behavior (viscosity vs shear
rate) for the heavy oil
(HO) in the absence and presence of the evaluated nanoparticles at
a concentration of 1000 mg·L–1 measured at
25 °C. The four different nanoparticles are commercial silica
nanoparticles (CSNs) and silica nanoparticles synthesized from different
sources: rice husk (SNRH), sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT).
Error bars represent data ± standard deviation.

Further microstructural changes can be assessed by determining
the effect of nanoparticles on HO pseudoplastic behavior. Rheological
models such as Cross,69 Sisko,70 and Herschel–Bulkley,71 among others, are commonly used for gathering this information.72,73 These phenomenological-like models are useful for obtaining insights
on rheological properties such as thixotropy and elastic responses
to strain. Most of them introduce viscosity plateau terms, in which
the viscosity of the examined sample has a Newtonian behavior at very
low or high deformations, known as the viscosity at zero and infinite
shear rates, i.e., viscosity values at which an asymptotic behavior
is observed regardless of a shear rate increase or decrease. Nonetheless,
these types of models have the restriction that they can be used in
cases in which the experimental data is near the mentioned plateaus
to increase analysis precision for providing phenomenological approaches
instead of mere fitting uses. Since the experimental data does not
approach this asymptotic behavior (in a log-scale plot),74 it was decided to use a simple power-law model
(eq 3) for estimating
the changes in the shear-thinning behavior of the HO upon nanoparticle
addition 3  where η (Pa·s) is the
estimated
viscosity in the shear-thinning region; γ ˙(s–1) is the shear rate; k is the consistency index,
which has the particular unit of Pa·sn; and n is the power-law index, which if it is equal
to 1, denotes Newtonian behavior, while if it is <1, it represents
a shear-thinning behavior.75 The estimated
values for n have the trend of HO-CSN > HO-SNT
>
HO-SNSS > HO-SNRH > HO, being 0.38, 0.36, 0.34, 0.29, and 0.26.
These
results denote that the inclusion of nanoparticles in the HO matrix
modifies the shear-thinning behavior, which would be related to a
microstructure modification,39,44,48 indicating a more Newtonian behavior and possibly lesser elastic
contributions to the stress response of the system.45

The degree of viscosity reduction (DVR) was estimated
from the
flow curves at a shear rate of 7 s–1, as after identifying
the residual wall slip, a shear rate was chosen in which the reported
viscosity would be lesser affected by this phenomenon but also not
as high for not being close to an initial transportation condition
via the pipeline.9 As it was discussed
above, the highest DVR was obtained when adding the CSN with a value
of 30%, and the lowest value (10.3%) was observed when using SNRH.
It is expected that the nanomaterials with a better performance in
viscosity reduction have the highest asphaltene–nanoparticle
attractive forces due to the presence of active sites conformed by
silanol groups. In this sense, the DVR should be related to the amount
of adsorbed asphaltenes in the surface of the nanoparticles as it
has also been suggested in previous studies.44,48

Thus, nanoparticle adsorption was evaluated for different
nanoparticles
at 25 °C and a constant asphaltene concentration in toluene model
solutions of 1000 mg·L–1. H bonds between Si–O–H
and heteroatoms present in asphaltenes, mainly N and S, can explain
the affinity between these molecules and the SiO2 surface,
as well as the increase of the adsorption capacity with the increase
of the silanol surface concentration. Some works have studied the
interaction between asphaltenes and various types of sorbents, in
which five different mechanisms were identified driving asphaltene
adsorption based on the van der Waals forces, π–π
stacking, cation−π stacking, acid–base interaction,
coordination, and H-bonding.51 However,
the significance of coordination, π–π stacking,
and H-bonding is mainly related to the self-association of asphaltene
once an asphaltene monolayer has been previously adsorbed onto the
sorbent’s surface.66 Similarly,
it has been demonstrated that the effect of van der Waals forces on
the adsorption is higher when the asphaltene aggregates are close
to the first layer of adsorbed asphaltenes.76 Nevertheless, a different behavior has been encountered regarding
the acid–base interactions as it has been determined that the
initial attractive asphaltene–adsorbent force is dominated
by the presence of N-containing functional groups,77 i.e., the monolayers formed by the initially adsorbed asphaltenes
contain more polar species, and the additional layers in a multilayer
assembly are formed mainly through van der Waals forces, H-bonding,
and π–π stacking.78

In this regard, sulfur has been established to have a minor role
in asphaltene adsorption compared to other species with oxygen and
nitrogen in their structure65,79 and is mainly related
to the fact that the nitrogen groups, which are partially positively
charged, can produce acid–base interactions with the typically
acidized sorbent surfaces. This behavior leads to an increase in asphaltene
adsorption as the nitrogen content increases in the oil-heavy fractions.20,40,80 This increased adsorption is
derived from the explained acid–base interactions, which in
silica surfaces are enhanced by the presence of hydroxyl Si–OH
functional groups (silanol), as the partially positive charged nitrogen
species are enabled to interact with the negatively charged silanol
groups.52−54

Hence, the measured amount of asphaltenes adsorbed
(Qads) was compared with the DVR and is
shown in Figure 10. Here, a direct
relation between viscosity reduction and the amount of adsorbed asphaltenes
is observed, indicating that the highest DVR was obtained with the
nanomaterials with the highest amount of silanol active sites. Therefore,
it is feasible to establish a direct relationship with silanol-adsorption-viscosity
reduction. Nonetheless, further analyses will be carried out in the
following section for isolating the distinct effects concerning HO
viscosity reduction.

nanoparticles (CSNs) and silica nanoparticles synthesized from different
sources: rice husk (SNRH), sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT).

2.3 Effect of Nanoparticle Texture
Some
authors have studied the effect of the physical properties of different
sorbents in the asphaltene adsorption process, such as surface area,81 pore volume and sizes,82 and particle sizes,83−85 concluding that these textural properties have a
significant role in the asphaltene–sorbent interactions and
subsequent adsorptive capacity.26,86 In the particular case
of silica nanoparticles, the evaluation of different particles with
distinct surface area, size, and surface chemical nature has been
reported, concluding that these textural and chemical properties are
the key variables in the asphaltene–nanoparticle interactions.30,33,49,50 Hence, it is of particular importance for the present study to isolate
the possible effects of the distinct textural characteristics of the
evaluated nanoparticles on asphaltene adsorption and further HO viscosity
reduction.

Figure 11 shows the effects of the nanoparticles’ (A) surface
roughness and (B) surface area on the degree of viscosity reduction
of heavy oil. The roughness was considered as an essential parameter
to be evaluated on asphaltene–nanoparticle interactions as
the adsorption of the monolayer formed by the most polar-heavy fractions
could be affected due to the asphaltene molecules’ adjustment
in the sorbent surface, leading to some surface area blockage produced
by steric effects.87 However, from the
observed results in Figure 11A, there is no clear trend between the surface roughness of
the nanoparticles and the DVR as the SNT deviates from the other particles.
Nonetheless, it can also be said that as the roughness increases,
the DVR increases too, except for a single point. However, this trend
should be corroborated in further studies with more than four particles
with different textural properties. Also, it has been established
that the asphaltene adsorption phenomenon is enhanced with an increase
in the surface area of materials with the same composition.30,81

Figure 11 Effect of the nanoparticles’ (A) roughness and (B) surface
area on the degree of viscosity reduction (DVR) of heavy oil. The
four different nanoparticles are commercial silica nanoparticles (CSNs)
and silica nanoparticles synthesized from different sources: rice
husk (SNRH), sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT). Error bars represent
±data standard deviation.

Nonetheless, as observed in Figure 11B, there is no evidence that a larger surface
necessarily will lead to a higher amount of asphaltenes adsorbed for
the nanoparticles evaluated. In this sense, it is more precise to
conclude that the adsorption is more related to the type of active
sites exposed in the sorbent surface. Further, the effect of the hydrodynamic
diameter in viscosity reduction will be discussed, as it was found
that this property has a significant effect on the amount of exposed
silanol on the surface of each nanoparticle.

Although the textural
properties of sorbents could play an essential
role in the asphaltene–sorbent interactions, the process is
primarily driven by the attractive forces between the asphaltenes
and the sorbent surface.88,89 Thereby, Figure 12 shows the effect
of the nanoparticle’s hydrodynamic diameter effect on the DVR.
It can be seen from Figure 12 that the DVR increases as the hydrodynamic diameter decreases
and is related to a higher exposure of the silanol groups on the surface
of the evaluated nanoparticles. A similar trend is observed as the
one in Figure 8B, which
means that a more significant silanol exposition on the surface of
the nanomaterials would lead to a higher viscosity reduction. Hence,
the chemical surface effect will be analyzed in the next section to
corroborate this hypothesis.

diameter (dp50) on the degree of viscosity reduction (DVR)
of heavy oil. The four
different nanoparticles are commercial silica nanoparticles (CSNs)
and silica nanoparticles synthesized from different sources: rice
husk (SNRH), sodium silicate (SNSS), and TEOS (SNT). Error bars represent
±data standard deviation.

2.4 Effect of Nanoparticle Surface Chemical Nature
According to the results in previous sections, it has been possible
to establish a direct relationship between the exposed active sites
on the surface of the nanoparticles and their performance on viscosity
reduction. To further demonstrate the validity of this affirmation,
the effect of nanoparticle surfaces’ chemical nature on the
DVR will be analyzed in this section. Figure 13 shows the effect of (A) total surface oxygen
(SO and siloxane groups) and (B) solely SO groups on the DVR. From
the obtained results, it is seen that there is no correlation between
the bulk amount of Si–O structures on the nanoparticle surface
and the performance on viscosity reduction. However, a trend between
SO presence and its effect on the obtained DVR is observed, which
proves the importance of the number of exposed silanol groups on the
asphaltene–nanoparticle attractive forces due to their capacity
of generating acid–base interactions with the most polar-heavy
fractions. These results agree with those reported by Pernyeszi and
Dékány82 and Betancur et
al.,30 where it was identified that the
fundamental property that enhances the asphaltene–silica interactions
is the chemical nature of the surface, particularly the silanol groups’
presence.

3 Conclusions
The study of the influence of
distinct silica nanoparticle surfaces,
namely, CSN, SNRH, SNT, and SNSS, in terms of their textural properties
and chemical nature on their interactions with asphaltenes and their
effect on viscosity reduction, was done correctly by assessing different
characteristics such as roughness, surface area, hydrodynamic diameter,
and exposed silanol groups on the surface of the nanomaterials.

It was concluded that some surface textural properties such as
area and roughness, which have been conventionally considered to play
an essential role in asphaltene adsorption, have minor effects on
this phenomenon compared to the availability of surface active sites.
The number of silanol groups on the nanomaterial surface was preliminarily
considered as the driving parameter of asphaltene adsorption and heavy
oil viscosity reduction, and these were quantified by estimating the
surface oxygen related to these groups (SO) through the XPS technique.
The SO amount was identified to follow the trend of CSN > SNT >
SNSS
> SNRH, and the hydrodynamic diameter was observed to affect active
site availability due to hindering effects. The degree of viscosity
reduction (DVR) was observed to follow the same trend, with the highest
DVR being 30%, followed by 18, 14, and 10.3%, respectively. This phenomenon
was explained by the measured adsorption capacity, which showed that
higher availability of silanol active sites enhances the asphaltene–nanoparticle
attractive forces and interactions. Finally, it was established that
the type of chemical structures presented in the sorbent surfaces
had an important role in the process, as no important effects on DVR
were observed when analyzing the bulk or total surface oxygen representing
both silanol and siloxane groups.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Four silica nanoparticles
were used for this study: three of them were in-house synthesized,
while the fourth one was a commercial nanoparticle from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). The synthesis of the in-house-prepared nanoparticles
had three different silicon precursors, namely, tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), sodium silicate (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), and rice husk from a local Colombian mill. The commercial
silica nanoparticles and the synthesized nanoparticles from TEOS,
sodium silicate, and rice husk were labeled as CSN, SNT, SNSS, and
SNRH, respectively. Additionally, reagents such as ethanol (99% purity),
ammonia (25% purity), chloride acid (37% purity), and sodium hydroxide
(98% purity) were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany),
while sodium chloride (99% purity) and sulfuric acid (98% purity)
were obtained from PanReac AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany), and finally,
cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) (99% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) for carrying out the distinct synthesis processes.
A Colombian HO of 11.2° API with saturate, aromatic, resin, and
asphaltene (SARA) contents in mass fractions of 12.8, 30.4, 40.1,
and 16.7%, respectively, was employed for asphaltene isolation and
rheological measurements. API gravity measurement was made according
to the ASTM D 1250 standard, while SARA analysis was carried out through
a micro deasphalting technique coupled with thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) following the IP 469 standard and using a TLC-FID/FPD Iatroscan
MK6 (Iatron Labs Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Nanoparticle Synthesis
The SNT
nanoparticles were synthesized through the sol–gel method.57 Briefly, TEOS/H2O/NH4OH/ethanol
was mixed in a 1:3:0.2:1.1 volumetric proportion; the solution was
stirred for 1 h and then heated at 110 °C for 5 h to remove excess
water. Calcination is not needed as the polymerization process for
obtaining this material is very effective and the nanoparticles precipitate
right after this reaction is terminated, which is why it is feasible
to obtain a clean material just by dehydration as a final synthesis
step.

The synthesis of SNSS nanoparticles was carried out according
to the procedure proposed by Zulfiqar et al.90 with some modifications. Accordingly, a solution of sodium silicate
and CTAB in deionized water was aged for 1 h. Then, HCl at a concentration
of 2.5% (in mass fraction) was added to the solution until a pH of
3 was obtained. Afterward, the solution was centrifuged, and the precipitate
was washed with deionized water to remove impurities. Finally, the
obtained solid was dried at 120 °C and further calcined at 600
°C to obtain the silica nanoparticles.

The SNRH synthesis
using rice husk was carried out based on the
route proposed by Ghorbani et al.56 with
slight modifications. The rice husk was washed with deionized water
to remove soil and dirt and further heated at 90 °C for 1 h to
remove humidity. Then, a treatment with HCl 1 M was used for 2 h at
80 °C. The rice husk was further rewashed to remove heavy elements,
and it was calcined at 600 °C for 6 h. The obtained ashes were
treated with a basic solution of NaOH 0.5 N at 90 °C under vigorous
stirring for 6 h. The solution was filtered and neutralized with H2SO4 15% to reach a pH of 8. The obtained gel was
left to stand for 24 h and further centrifuged at 4500 rpm. The material
was filtered and washed with deionized water to remove the sodium
sulfate salts and finally dehydrated and calcined under the same temperature
conditions of the SNSS to obtain the SNRH material.

4.2.2 Nanoparticle Characterization
The
nanoparticles were texturally characterized by their surface area
(SBET) through the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method,91 by N2 physisorption
at −196 °C using an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was used for determining
the nanomaterials’ mean particle size (dp50) with
a Tecnai F20 Super Twin TMP (FEI Company, Oregon) with a resolution
of 0.1 nm, operated at 200 kV as the accelerating voltage. The hydrodynamic
diameter was obtained in an aqueous phase using a NanoPlus-3 (Micromeritics,
GA). The nanomaterial roughness was assessed through atomic force
microscopy (AFM) using AFM 5500 (Agilent Technologies, Chandler, AZ)
equipment, and the obtained results were analyzed using Gwyddion software.92 An aqueous drop of 10 mg·L–1 of the different silica nanoparticles was deposited over a mica
surface and dried at 50 °C during one night and then measured
into the AFM.

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique63 was used to identify the functional groups in
the surface of the nanoparticles with an IRAffinity-1 FTIR (Shimadzu,
Japan) spectrophotometer. Also, surface groups were determined through
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a PHOIBOS 150 1D-DLD (SPECS
GmbH, Berlin, Germany) photoelectronic X-ray spectrometer (NAP-XPS)
analyzer using monochromatic light of Al Kα (1486.7 eV, 13 kV,
100 W) with 100 and 30 eV energy steps for general and high-resolution
spectra; the values for general and high-resolution spectra were 1
and 0.1 eV, respectively. The spectra were analyzed using CasaXPS
software.93

4.2.3 Asphaltene
Adsorption
The asphaltenes
were isolated from the HO based on their solubility as it has been
accounted for in other studies.32,37 The interactions between
silica nanoparticles and the asphaltenes were evaluated in terms of
the amount of asphaltenes adsorbed (Qads) over the selected nanoparticles using a UV–vis Genesys 10S
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at a wavelength
of 295 nm. The tests were carried out following the procedure proposed
by Guzmán et al.33 with solutions
at an asphaltene concentration of 1000 mg·L–1 prepared from a stock solution of 5000 mg·L–1. A fixed dosage of 10 g·L–1 of nanoparticles
was used in each prepared solution for prompting their deposition
upon asphaltene adsorption and providing a better supernatant analysis.

4.2.4 Rheological Measurements
A sample
preparation protocol was implemented to guarantee proper dispersibility
into HO and avoid experimental errors in the rheological measurements.44,94 For this, the heavy crude oil was weighed, and the silica nanoparticles
were added and further manually stirred for 15 min at 35 °C due
to the high viscosity of the samples that make stirring by other mechanical
methods unfeasible. The HO in the absence of the nanoparticles was
also stirred under the same time and temperature conditions to have
a similar disturbance and precondition regarding the samples with
nanoparticles.94 Later, the samples were
left to rest until the sample temperature was reduced to 25 °C.
A nanoparticle concentration of 1000 mg·L–1 was used as it has been demonstrated in previous studies that it
is close to the optimum dosage for obtaining the highest viscosity
reduction.45,46

The rheological behavior
of the samples was evaluated using a Kinexus Pro (Malvern Instruments,
Worcestershire, U.K.) rheometer equipped with a solvent trap and with
a Peltier cell for controlling the temperature with a precision of
1 × 10–2 °C. The tests were carried out
using a parallel-plate geometry of 20 mm with a GAP of 0.3 mm at a
temperature of 25 °C with a 2 min shear rate ramp starting from
0.01 to 50 s–1. This small GAP is used to reach
high shear values; thus, the misalignment of the instrument and residual
wall slip was checked as these might have an impact on the measured
viscosity. It was found that the viscosity is independent of GAPs
larger than 0.5 mm, while it tends to decrease for lower GAPs. In
this sense, it can be considered that the viscosity of the samples
is underestimated mainly due to an intrinsic instrument misalignment,
which also causes a wall slip phenomenon at low GAPs; however, as
the main objective of this study is to compare the effect of different
surface physicochemical nature of distinct nanoparticles on their
interactions with HO heavy fractions and viscosity reduction, it is
not necessary to adjust the viscosity values through a wall slip correction
as it is considered that the instrument misalignment affects all of
the samples equally.95−97 Furthermore, 2 min was used for increasing the shear
rate from 0.01 to 50 s–1 as it has been reported
by other studies for preventing edge fracture and flow instabilities.10,47 The viscosity reduction obtained by the nanoparticle usage was assessed
by the degree of viscosity reduction (DVR). The DVR was calculated
according to eq 1 1  where μHO and μHO–SNP are the base HO viscosity in the absence and
presence of the different types of silica nanoparticles, respectively.29,44 All of the rheological measurements were carried out by triplicate
to ensure the accuracy of the experiments.
