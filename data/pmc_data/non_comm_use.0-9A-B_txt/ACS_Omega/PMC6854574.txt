Two types of plasmonic metamaterial
absorbers (PMAs) formed from
patterned all-dielectric resonators are designed and demonstrated
experimentally in the terahertz (THz) range. Both PMAs use a simple
grating design on highly N-doped silicon. The first shows broadband
absorption with near-perfect peak absorbance at 1.45 THz and a bandwidth
of 1.05 THz for 90% absorbance, while the second is a dual-band absorber.
Experiments show that the second absorber has two distinct absorption
peaks at 0.96 and 1.92 THz with absorption rates of 99.7 and 99.9%,
respectively. A fundamental cavity mode coupled to coaxial surface
plasmon polaritons is responsible for the characteristics of both
PMAs. Additionally, the optically tunable responses of these all-dielectric
absorbers demonstrate that the absorption behavior can be modified.
The quality factor (Q) values of the dual-band resonances
are 4.6 and 7.8 times larger than those of the broadband PMAs, respectively,
which leads to a better sensing performance. As an example, the two
proposed PMAs act as high-sensitivity sensors and demonstrate considerable
potential for chlorpyrifos detection. These results show that these
PMAs can be used as sensors that can detect the presence of trace
pesticides in adsorption analyses, among other practical applications.

1 Introduction
Metamaterials composed
of artificially constructed electromagnetic
materials have recently attracted considerable research interest because
of their ability to produce unusual engineered electromagnetic responses
that are not available in nature; the electromagnetic properties of
these metamaterials can be described using effective parameters such
as the effective permittivity and effective permeability.1 In electromagnetics, metamaterials are artificially
engineered materials that gain their effective properties from the
metamaterial structures rather than inheriting them directly from
their constituent materials.2 New composite
materials with subwavelength sizes and exotic electromagnetic properties
that are generally unattainable in nature are being designed and produced
for a variety of applications, including perfect lenses,3 cloaking devices,4 resonators,5 and agile antennas.6 Another important application of these metamaterials
is in the development of spectrally selective perfect absorbers that
can be used to develop high-sensitivity detectors for a variety of
security-related applications, along with biosensing7,8 and tunable filter applications.9

In general, traditional perfect absorbers have taken the form of
metallic resonators on a ground plane and are designed to eliminate
reflections and enhance absorption.10 While
major progress has been made in the development of metallic metamaterials
over the past few years that can achieve multiband absorption,11 there have also been some drawbacks, such as
their complex design and challenging fabrication requirements to achieve
broadband operation,12 high material Ohmic
losses, and anisotropic properties.13,14 Recently,
all-dielectric metamaterials have been gaining considerable attention
because of their low intrinsic loss15−18 and tunable19 characteristics. This article presents all-dielectric perfect
absorbers in which the thermal conductivity is approximately 3 orders
smaller than that of metals20 for operation
at terahertz (THz) frequencies, at which silicon with its relatively
limited conductivity can support either bound surface waves or surface
plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The past few years have seen substantial
progress in all-dielectric plasmonic metamaterial-based photonic devices,
and numerous applications, such as plasmonic sensors, have been reported.21−24 For plasmonic sensors, the quality factor (Q) serves
as a measure of sensor performance, which is dependent on the shape,
size, and other parameters of the resonator.25 Reported results have indicated that a narrow linewidth may potentially
be helpful in improving the performance of these sensors.26

Here, we introduce novel Si-based plasmonic
metamaterial absorbers
(PMAs) that are composed of a simple single-layer structure to develop
a broadband absorber and a double-band absorber for use in the terahertz
region. The fabricated broadband absorber shows nearly 99.9% absorbance
at 1.45 THz and a bandwidth of ∼1.05 THz, while the double-band
absorber shows two distinctive absorption peaks at 0.96 and 1.92 THz
with absorption rates of 99.7 and 99.9%, respectively. We show that
these absorbers are dynamically controllable under optical excitation
and that they have significant potential for use in biological monitoring
and sensing applications. The proposed absorbers also have potential
for use in improving the sensitivity of semiconductor devices.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Design
Figure 1a shows
an illustration of
the PMA structure, which consists of a square array of all-dielectric
rings and cylindrical disks. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image of the PMA structure is illustrated in Figure 1b; the grating consists of a ring (r and r1 are the outer and inner
radii, respectively) and a cylinder (the radius is r2), which are deeply etched onto a silicon wafer that
has been N-doped with a carrier density of 4.63 × 1017 cm–3. The repeat period of the grating is p = 200 μm, the dielectric substrate thickness is t1 = 300 μm, and the metamaterial layer
thickness is t2 = 50 μm. Under these
conditions, we design two types of split-ring resonators (SRRs) with
different geometries and the same carrier density in the micrometer
region. We set the parameters of the first grating of the broadband
PMA as follows: the outer radius and the inner radius of the ring
are r = 75 μm and r1 = 60 μm and the radius of the cylinder is r2 = 34 μm. The outer radius and the inner radius
of the ring are r = 90 μm and r1 = 70 μm and the radius of the cylinder r2 = 55 μm for the dual-band PMA. To design
and optimize the grating structures, we used the commercial software
CST (a commercial electromagnetic solver), in which the permittivity
of the highly doped Si is treated using the Drude dispersion model27 1  where ε0 = 11.7 is the intrinsic
silicon dielectric constant, γ = 1.72 × 1013 s–1 is the Drude collision frequency,  is the plasma frequency, n is
the doped carrier density of silicon, and m0 = 0.26me is the effective mass
of the carriers, which includes the contributions from the N-doped
electrons. The unit cell was subject to periodic boundary conditions
in the x and y planes and was open
in the z direction in the free space environment.
To investigate the resonant behavior of these absorbers, we obtained
the reflectance (S11) and transmittance
(S21) parameters of the metamaterials
with the two different geometries and calculated their absorption
(A) values using the equation A =
1 – |S11|2 –
|S21|2(S21 ≈ 0). The results in Figure 1c show that the narrow gap can be used to
achieve double-band absorption, while the broader gap leads to broadband
absorption. The performance of the structure with a periodicity of
200 μm and r = 75 μm has been shown for
the different gap parameters in Figure 1d, which presents the absorption spectrum as a function
of both the gap width between the ring and the cylinder and the frequency.
The dotted black line in Figure 1d indicates how the resonance bandwidth changes as
the gap width increases. We chose a gap width of 26 μm, which
gives rise to a broadband absorption (≥90%) of width of 1.05
THz, corresponding to 72.4% of the center frequency of 1.45 THz. The
results in Figure 1d also show that the double narrow bandwidths absorption can be achieved
by reducing the gap width. From a macroscopic point of view, the metamaterial
layer on a Si substrate realizes the function of antireflection coating,
which can reduce reflection. At the same time, the carrier density
of Si is about 1017 cm–3; such a heavily
doped Si have metallic property. The THz transmittance is almost zero
(Figure 1c). Thus,
it can lead to a perfect absorption.

devices. (d) Absorption spectrum as a function of gap size and frequency.

2.2 Absorption Characteristics
of the PMAs
Left side panels in Figure 2a,b show the unit cell of the PMAs with different
gaps. The
calculated and experimental absorption spectra of the proposed broadband
absorber at a 25° angle of incidence are shown in Figure 2a. The absorber can achieve
more than 90% absorption over the range from 0.95 to 2.0 THz, which
gives a bandwidth of 1.05 THz. The absorption peaks (∼99%)
occur at 1.03, 1.45, and 1.77 THz, and the absorption is nearly 100%
at three resonant peaks. It is obvious from Figure 2b that the dual-band absorber has two discrete
absorption peaks located at approximately 0.96 THz (f1) and 1.92 THz (f2), which
each have absorption values of more than 99.6%. The dual-band PMAs
has Q factors of 1.1 (f1) and 1.88 (f2), which are 4.6 and 7.8
times larger than the Q factor of the broadband PMAs,
respectively. The difference in size caused by the PMA manufacturing
process, or the error caused by the measurement itself, is the cause
of inconsistency between the experimental results and the simulation
results. It is apparent that the change of bandwidth depends on the
gap width. The broadband operation can be obtained by lowering the Q factor value, which can be achieved through overlapping
multiple resonant modes by changing the inner radius of the ring and
the radius of the cylinder.

2.3 Electric and Magnetic Field Profiles
Electromagnetic
simulations are performed to resolve the spatially
distributed losses in the cavity at the resonance frequency. These
simulations can be computed using a frequency-domain solver to simulate
an infinite array. Figure 3 clearly shows that the electric field of the broadband PMAs
reaches a maximum at resonance at 1.45 THz. It can be inferred from Figure 3c that at resonance
most of the incident energy is absorbed by the center pillar because
of the strong current induction associated with the coaxial SPP mode.
A relatively weak electric field can be observed along the narrowed
cavity edges. To provide a clear understanding of the nature of the
dual-band absorption in the designed structure, the calculated electric
field and magnetic field (in the plane where z =
0) distributions corresponding to the two absorption maxima (f1 and f2) are presented
in Figure 4. As shown
in Figure 4a, the distributions
of the electric field in mode f1 are mainly
focused on the dielectric layer of the absorber, which means that
mode f1 is a localized electromagnetic
resonance. Therefore, mode f1 is the fundamental
resonance mode of the proposed structure. For mode f2, we see that the electric field (Figure 4b) is distributed over both the center of
the unit cell area between the units and on the dielectric layer,
where the resonance is weaker than that of f1. Comparing the magnetic field distributions of Figure 4c,d, for a higher frequency
at 1.92 THz, the absorption peaks are derived from the coupling of
multiple modes of the resonator.

THz.

PMA for the 0.96 and 1.92 THz resonance modes.

2.4 Dispersion Behavior of the PMAs
Further
insights into the responses of these cavities can be gained from examination
of the dispersion behavior of coaxial plasmonic waveguides. We derive
an approximate dispersion equation to establish an explicit connection
between a structure with a coaxial cross section, which thus has a
concentric geometry, and a semiconductor–insulator–semiconductor
(SIS) structure with a simpler planar geometry. The proposed method
has broad applicability and can also be extended to provide further
insights into more complex concentric waveguide structures. Consider
a SIS structure that is formed using the same metals and dielectric
materials as the coaxial structure and with a gap (g) ≪ r1,r2; the approximate dispersion model of this structure can be
expressed in the form28 2  where
ε1 = ε1(ω) represents the
dielectric function of the semiconductor
and ε2 is the positive, real dielectric constant
of the insulator. , i = 1, 2, where k0 is
the wave vector of free space. For these
coaxial plasmonic waveguides, we assume that the propagating mode
has a total wave vector that is determined by the SIS dispersion relation
given in ref (29) 3   4  where β is the wave vector
component along the propagation axis (perpendicular to the cross-sectional
plane) and kθ is the transverse
component in the cross-sectional plane. In the above expression, r = (r1 + r2)/2 and μ is an integer that represents the angular
momentum. By combining eqs 2–4, we obtain the dispersion
of the coaxial plasmonic waveguides as follows 5  This expression allows
us to estimate all
features of the dispersion behavior of the deep subwavelength modes
that are supported by the coaxial structure. The condition for plasmonic
resonance can be approximated as βN = (2N + m)π/2td (N = 0, 1, 2, ...), where td is the cavity depth and m represents
the phase change upon reflection at both ends of the cavity (m = {0.9, 1} for the plasmonic and perfect electric conductor
(PEC) boundaries, respectively). Based on the resonance condition
and the dispersion relation, these cavities are expected to exhibit
their fundamental resonance at a wavenumber of β0 = 2.826 × 104 rad/m. Because of the
strong field confinement, the dispersion curve of the plasmonic waveguide
(β) lies to the right of the PEC waveguide
dispersion curve. From Figure 5, the above wavenumber corresponds to a frequency of 1.36
THz, which is in good agreement with the resonance frequency observed
from both the experimental and numerical results. For the absorbers,
resonant frequencies corresponding to eight different thicknesses
are selected to correspond to the theoretically calculated values.
In Figure 5, triangles
represent the resonant frequency of the double narrow-band absorber
and circles represent the results for the broadband absorber. Figure 5 shows that the three
absorption peaks of the broadband device correspond to the lines at
μ = 0, 1 and PEC μ = 1, respectively, while for the narrow-band
absorber, the first absorption peak corresponds to μ1 = 0 and the second absorption peak corresponds to the line where
PEC μ1 = 2. This means that the third peak of the
broadband absorber and the second absorption peak of the narrow-band
absorber have the same resonance mode, similar to metal absorbers.30

the PEC and
the plasmonic coaxial waveguides. These curves were obtained from
the appropriate analytical expression (dotted lines) and from a simulation
method (filled circles and triangles).

2.5 Photoexcitation of the All-Dielectric PMAs
To ease the understanding of the phototunable capabilities of the
proposed absorbers, we perform full-wave electromagnetic simulations.
Analysis of the carrier density distribution indicates that we are
unable to excite the all-dielectric PMA structure homogeneously using
the pump beam, which thus necessitates consideration of the carrier
density gradient in our simulation.31 Therefore,
we divide the grating layer into 10 slices, where each slice has a
thickness of 5 μm, as shown in the graph inset in Figure 6b. The carrier density distribution
in silicon along the z direction is calculated using 6  where α = 1020 cm–1 is the linear absorption coefficient, f0 is the incident fluence when assuming a circular cross-section
shape
for the Gaussian beam, Eph is the photon
energy of the pump beam, and z is the depth in the
silicon, where z = 0 at the top surface. The simulated
results for the broadband absorber and dual-band absorber under optical
excitation are given in Figure 6a,b, respectively. For simplicity, we use the Drude model
to describe the frequency and the carrier density; the carrier density
variation in the top layer is related linearly to the pump fluence,
as illustrated in the graph inset in Figure 6a. Regardless of whether the broadband PMAs
or the dual-band PMAs are considered, the 90% bandwidth and the peak
absorption both show a strong dependence on increasing optical power,
as shown in Figure 6c,d.

fluences. Inset: carrier density at the top surface of the silicon.

fluences. Inset: power loss density distribution for the corresponding
mode. (c) 90% bandwidths of the two PMAs versus the corresponding

versus pump fluence.

2.6 Sensing
Properties of PMAs for High-Sensitivity
Sensors
A schematic representation of the experiments in
which the PMAs operate as sensors is shown in Figure 7a. We measured the changes in the THz radiation
spectra absorbed through the metamaterials following deposition of
chlorpyrifos (CPS) and demonstrated that the all-dielectric metamaterial
absorbers operating at terahertz frequencies act as high-sensitivity
sensors. We now describe the THz absorption experiments when 100 μL
of CPS solution was dropped on the surface of the PMAs at concentrations
ranging from 0.1 to 100 ppm; the solutions were prepared by dissolving
appropriate amounts of CPS powder in a petroleum ether solvent. In
could be found that there was a clear change of spectrum by adding
chlorpyrifos solutions onto the surface of the metamaterial absorber.
Although, as reported, three absorption peaks of chlorpyrifos were
located at 1.47, 1.93, and 2.73 THz,32 they
were not around the peaks of the metamaterial at 0.93 and 1.33 THz.
However, chlorpyrifos located in the gratings induce a change in the
dielectric properties of the metamaterials. As a result, changes of
the amplitude and frequency in the absorption peak could be observed. Figure 7b,c shows the experimentally
measured changes in the CPS (molecular formula shown in the inset
in Figure 7b) solutions
on the PMAs and show that the deposition location can change the absorption
properties of the PMAs. For CPS concentrations ranging from 0.1 to
100 ppm, the peak absorption amplitude increased as the CPS concentration
increased; we attributed this increasing peak absorption amplitude
to the behavior of the antireflection coatings, which reduce the surface
reflection and thus cause increased absorption. To observe these changes
clearly, we partially magnified the absorption of the PMAs, with results
as shown in the insets in Figure 7d–f. As shown in Figure 7d–f, the blue circle indicates the
absorption coefficient detected by the pesticide at each concentration
on the absorber and the red line shows that the resonant absorption
shift can be approximated as a linear response that increases with
the PMAs absorbance increasing. These results showed that the peak
spectral intensity had good resonances with the CPS concentrations
ranging from 0.1 to 100 ppm that were deposited on the surface of
a semiconductor metamaterial. The regression coefficients achieved
at the peak intensity were 0.8437, 0.8966, and 0.9331, as shown in Figure 7d–f, respectively.
The increase in the resonant absorption is observed more clearly in
the narrow-band absorber than in the broadband device because of the
higher Q factors. As a consequence, the Q values for the resonance frequencies centered at f1 and f2 are 4.6 and 7.8 times
larger than those of the broadband PMAs, which solved the problem
of poor sensitivity of broadband PMA.

CPS using the PMAs. (b) Measured
absorption spectra of the broadband PMAs for 0.1–100 ppm of

of the dual-band PMAs for 0.1–100 ppm of CPS. (d–f)
Regression curves established for the broadband PMAs and the first
peak and the second peak of the dual-band PMAs based on spectral intensity
variations, respectively.

To summarize, we have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated
the feasibility of THz-level sensing based on metamaterials for deposition
detection and CPS is selected as an example target substance. THz
metamaterial sensing is a universal method because it is based on
dielectric sensing, while selective detection can also be made possible
by functionalizing the substrates using antibodies that are specific
to the target substances. The approach presented here is likely to
constitute an important step toward the fabrication of high-sensitivity
biosensors and lab-on-a-chip devices, thus enabling high-speed on-site
detection of hazardous substances in a variety of environments.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have proposed
two all-dielectric terahertz plasmonic
metamaterial absorbers that were formed using the same heavily doped
silicon but with different geometric parameters. It was found that
in addition to a broadband perfect absorber with a broad gap, a narrow-band
absorber with dual-band characteristics and high resonance absorption
peaks was also fabricated. When compared with the broadband absorber,
the dual-band absorber has a higher Q factor, which
means that the proposed absorber has significant potential for use
in sensor applications. Using these metamaterial absorbers, we experimentally
observed clear shifts in the absorption following the deposition of
CPS (where concentrations down to 0.1 ppm could be detected). Furthermore,
we proposed and studied the optical tunability of these two types
of absorbers via simulations, which highlighted a new strategy for
control of dielectric metamaterials and demonstrates a potential approach
to achieve device reconfigurability for future applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fabrication of the All-Dielectric
PMAs
The all-dielectric terahertz PMAs were fabricated on
an n-type doped
silicon wafer using conventional photolithography and deep reactive-ion
etching based on the large-scale microfabrication techniques. After
cleaning the silicon wafers with acetone followed by dehydration baking,
a 4 μm-thick layer of photoresist (AZ6130) was spin-coated on
top of the wafer. Photolithography is used to achieve the pattern
of the microstructure after soft-baking on a hotplate. Then, the sample
was exposed to light at an optical density of 10 mJ/cm2 for 3 s. The
exposed wafer was developed for 40 s to create openings for the etching,
and a mixture of SF6 (450 sccm) and C4F8 (190 sccm) gases was alternatively permitted into a high
vacuum chamber and ionized by applying radio frequency power toward
the silicon wafer to create deep and smooth trenches in the silicon
wafer. Finally, the wafer was cleaned with acetone to remove the photoresist
and polymer residue.

4.2 Pesticide Sample Preparation
CPS
standard substances were in the form of solid powder (analytical grade,
≥99.0%), homogenized in an agate mortar, and sieved with 100
mesh; CPS and petroleum ether were used as a solute and solvent, respectively.
Firstl, a CPS sample in solution with a concentration of 100 ppm in
petroleum ether was prepared by mixing 5 mg of solid-state powder
of CPS standard with 50 mL of petroleum ether. Then, the CPS solutions
in concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 were prepared by dilution
with the 100 ppm solvent. Finally, the prepared CPS solutions were
uniformly mixed by a centrifugal oscillator.

4.3 Characterization
of the All-Dielectric PMAs
The THz absorption coefficient
and refractive index spectra in
the frequencies of 0.2–3 THz were characterized using terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) based on photoconductive antennas.
CTT-1800 (China Communication Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China)
consists of an ultrashort pulse fiber laser, a laser-gated photoconductive
semiconductor emitter, and a laser-gated photoconductive semiconductor
receiver. It uses the ultrafast fiber laser sources and semiconductor-based
detection systems. The central wavelength of the ultrashort pulse
fiber laser is 780 nm, the pulse width is 54 ps, and the scanning
precision is 1 μm. Experiments were conducted at room temperature
of 15–30°C, and dry nitrogen was filled into the sample
bin to avoid the influence of moisture. The average spectrum of 900
time-domain scans with PE as a reference is obtained as the spectrum
of the tested sample. PE is an ideal mixture because it has extremely
low absorption of THz radiation and therefore has no effect on the
location of absorption peaks of the pesticides.
