A new class of highly porous organic
sorbents called microporous
humins is presented. These microporous humins are derived from sustainable
and industrially abundant resources, have high heat of CO2 sorption, and could potentially be useful for the separation of
carbon dioxide from gas mixtures. Their synthesis involves the polymerization
of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) in concentrated sulfuric acid and
treatment with diethyl ether and heat. In particular, the porosities
were tuned by the heat treatment. HMF is a potential platform chemical
from biorefineries and a common intermediate in carbohydrate chemistry.
A high uptake of CO2 (up to 5.27 mmol/g at 0 °C and
1 bar) and high CO2-over-N2 and CO2-over-CH4 selectivities were observed. The microporous
humins were aromatic and structurally amorphous, which was shown in
a multipronged approach using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, elemental analysis,
and wide-angle X-ray scattering.

Introduction
The purpose of this
study was to design a new class of organic
microporous sorbents for CO2 removal processes, using only
industrially abundant and sustainable resources. As of today, many
microporous sorbents are derived from petroleum products or include
scarce elements. Consequently, efforts are being made to synthesize
sorbents through more sustainable or renewable means.1−3 It is established that carbon-rich materials can be synthesized
using platform molecules of biorefineries.4 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is such a molecule,5,6 which
could also be used in fuel additives, as a monomer, and in the synthesis
of other chemical derivatives.5−7

When sugars or biomass are
converted to HMF and levulinic and formic
acids, solid side products often form. These side products are called
humins.4,8 They have polymeric structures and their
mechanism of formation has been studied in detail.8 They have been related to the hydrochars or biocarbons
that precipitate during hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) processes,
in which HMF has been shown to be an intermediate reaction product.9 The use of humins is thought to be limited to
the generation of heat or as soil enhancers.8 However, because of the complex, diverse, and relatively unknown
structure8 of humins, we see large potential
in using them in material applications. For instance, humin-containing
foams have been prepared.10

The reactions
of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with
sugars have been studied for decades, and it is well established that
humins form in such reactions.11,12 Another documented
use of H2SO4 is as an activation agent in the
production of activated carbons from biomass.13 Although there are variations to the procedure, typically, biomass
is impregnated with H2SO4 and subsequently heated
in a N2 atmosphere. Mechanistically, H2SO4 has been proposed to act as a dehydration catalyst during
such activation.14 H2SO4 can act as an acid catalyst during synthesis of carbon-based
materials using silica templates. Hard templating of carbons using
silica templates involves multiple steps and high temperatures and
the carbons can have surface areas up to 2200 m2/g.15 Carbon films have also been produced from sucrose
and H2SO4 using polystyrene spheres as templates.16 H2SO4 has also been used
as a reagent in HTC17 of biomass and molecules
and to produce sulfur-doped carbon dots from waste frying oil.18

As HMF could be a future platform chemical
and is a common intermediate
in carbohydrate chemistry, the objective of this study was to derive
highly porous humins from it. We synthesized microporous humins with
large surface areas and high levels of CO2 uptake from
HMF in conc. H2SO4.

Results and Discussion
Microporous
Humins from HMF
Microporous humins were
synthesized by transferring atomized droplets of HMF to conc. H2SO4, subjecting the reactive system to successive
treatment with diethyl ether, and a final heat treatment. The microporous
humin derived from HMF at 400 °C (MHH-4) displayed higher specific
surface area and pore volume than that prepared at 200 °C MHH-2,
as can be seen from Table 1. These differences appear to relate to heat-induced removal
of small molecules. The yield for MHH-4 (40 wt %) was lower than that
for MHH-2 (56 wt %). An additional valuable aspect of the procedure
to synthesize the microporous humins was the high level of reproducibility.
The corresponding CO2 sorption isotherms for replicates
of MHH-4 and MHH-2 are displayed in Figures S1 and S2.

The heat treatment was important
for the microporosity as was the
other steps of the procedure. Treatment or washing with a solvent
is commonly used but seldom discussed and can be considered crucial
for the extraction of molecules, for example, solvents, catalysts,
monomers, dimers, and so forth, from an already formed polymer or
polymer precursor.19,20 However, diethyl ether appears
not only to have extracted small molecules but also to have induced
a phase separation which produced part of the solid phase of interest.

Molecular Analyses Revealed Largely Aromatic Structures
Conc. H2SO4 is an established oxidation and
dehydration agent;18 however, the position
of MHH-2 in the van Krevelen diagram21 of Figure 1 shows that it is
not a direct dehydration product21−23 of HMF and HMF itself
is a dehydration product of fructose/glucose.24 With the approximate chemical formula of C232H141O105S, MHH-2 appeared instead to be a dehydrogenated25 product of HMF having a reduced H/C ratio. This
ratio was consistent with a (partly) aromatic structure. Even though
the O/C ratio of MHH-2 was slightly smaller than that of HMF, it does
not conclusively exclude that oxidation processes had occurred.26 A combination of dehydration and dehydrogenation
processes could also lead to a reduced O/C ratio. In comparison, solid
acids derived from lignin27 showed higher
H/C and O/C ratios than MHH-2, whereas a solid acid produced from
naphthalene28 displayed a lower ratio.
Hydrochars from glucose29 and humins,12,30 on the other hand, displayed lower O/C ratios than MHH-2. The carbon
content of MHH-2 was higher than those in the solid acids produced
from lignin27 and naphthalene28 but lower than those in the hydrochars derived
from lapsi seeds and glucose.29,31 The carbon content
in MHH-2 compared well with humins but the hydrogen content was lower,
except for the product from HMF heated to 190 °C at pH 2.5 (see Table S1), which had comparable values for both
carbon and hydrogen contents. Furthermore, 0.69 wt % of sulfur was
introduced into MHH-2. This amount was much smaller than that in many
other solid acids, which have been shown to contain 3.9–20.0
wt % of sulfur.27−29 Carbonaceous solids with sulfonic acid-based surface
groups, known as sulfonated carbons, are heterogeneous solid acid
catalysts. They are typically synthesized by direct and incomplete
carbonization or postsynthetic modification of carbonized precursors
with H2SO4 or other sulfonating agents.32,33

of glucose, and pure glucose, fructose, cellulose, and HMF (see Table S1). MHH-X denotes microporous humins derived
from HMF at 200 and 400 °C.

The approximate chemical formula of MHH-4 was C470H213O109S (Table S1).
Its higher carbon content and lower H/C and O/C atomic ratios than
those of MHH-2 indicated a higher degree of aromatization. The carbon
content was higher and the hydrogen content was lower than those in
typical humins.34 Its position in the van
Krevelen diagram21 of Figure 1 indicates that it was a dehydration
product of HMF. A similar trend for the H/C and O/C atomic ratios,
as for the HMF-to-MHH-4 transformation, has been observed for glucose
treated with dilute H2SO4 and subjecting the
formed material to a CO2 gas mixture and increasing the
temperature.35 In addition, MHH-4 contained
even less sulfur than MHH-2 and had a similar oxygen-to-sulfur atomic
ratio.

To study the molecular nature of the microporous humins,
solid-state
cross-polarization (CP) 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were recorded for MHH-2. The spectrum in Figure 2 was recorded by using the
total suppression of spinning sideband (TOSS) pulse sequence.36,37 It has broad bands centered at chemical shifts of 128, 153, and
189 ppm. These chemical shifts were assigned to the sp2 carbons of aromatic rings, linked −HC=C–O in furanic rings or phenols, and carbonyls, respectively.
No bands are observed at chemical shifts of 110–118 ppm, corresponding
to C=C–C or O–C=CH– in furanic rings.38,39 Also, the chemical shifts typical for aliphatic 13C are
absent, showing that this synthetic procedure was efficient in removing
aliphatic carbon typically found in other humins.30,39 Consistent with the low sulfur content, the typical bands for sulfonated
aromatics at chemical shifts of about 140 ppm40,41 are not observed in Figure 2. Taken all together, the 13C NMR data indicated
that MHH-2 was mainly aromatic with oxygen heteroatoms and carbonyl
functional groups, likely aldehydes or carboxylic acids, and contained
no detectable amounts of aliphatic carbons.

resonance spectrum of MHH-2 recorded under magic angle spinning with

microporous humin derived from HMF at 200 °C.

Analyses of the vibrational spectra of MHH-2 and
MHH-4 allowed
us to identify certain chemical groups and to recognize features of
the disordered molecular nature. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrum of MHH-2 (Figure S4) has bands
at frequencies of 1600 and 1716 cm–1, indicative
of C=C and C=O bonds, respectively.42 The spectrum of MHH-4 have larger relative absorbance of
these bands, which are consistent with a larger fraction of aromatic
C=C bonds to C=O bonds in MHH-4 than that in MHH-2.
The Raman spectra in Figures S5–S8 show typical disordered carbon structures of the bands;43 however, they varied significantly with the
laser power used. Changes occurred in the spectra already at a low
laser power of 0.056 mW for the 532 nm laser. Less significant changes
were observed in the spectra when using a 785 nm laser. For sample
MHH-4, no visible alteration of the spot on the sample that had been
irradiated with laser light was observed. The damaging effects of
laser irradiation on carbon materials are generally well established.44,45

Thermally Stable and Amorphous Structures
The microporous
humins displayed relatively high thermal stability in an oxidizing
atmosphere. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) traces in Figure S9 were consistent with high stabilities
of MHH-2 and MHH-4 up to temperatures of almost 300 °C in air.
Certainly, the thermal stabilities were lower than those of typical
activated carbons,15,46 but compared well with the solid
acid produced from naphthalene.28 No ash
content was detected after TGA.

As expected, the microporous
humins had an amorphous nature as could be deduced from X-ray scattering
analysis. The wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) curves for MHH-2
and MHH-4 in Figure 3 are similar with broad peaks centered at 42° and 21° (2θ),
respectively. The shoulder peak centered at 10° is slightly more
pronounced for MHH-4 than that for MHH-2. The peaks correspond to q = 2.9, 1.5, and 0.7 Å–1. Various
analyses of WAXS curves of carbon-rich amorphous solids, including
those performed with reverse Monte Carlo routines,47,48 are consistent with sp2-hybridized structures. The relatively
low signal-to-noise ratios of the WAXS data, recorded on an in-house
diffractometer, limited the options for quantitative comparisons.
Furthermore, the measurements were carried out under ambient conditions
and water adsorption is known49 to shift
the peaks to slightly higher q values for activated carbons. Irrespectively,
a qualitative discussion of the WAXS curves in Figure 3 is presented below.

Figure 3 WAXS curves of microporous
humins derived from HMF at 200 and 400
°C (MHH-X).

The broad peaks and absence
of sharp X-ray diffraction peaks50 in the
WAXS curves of MHH-2 and MHH-4 show that
they are X-ray amorphous. Disordered aromatic carbon-rich structures
are likely responsible for the broad peaks at ∼21 and ∼42°
(2θ). For other and possibly related materials, this broadness
has been discussed51 and attributed to,
for instance, distorted graphitic structures52 and carbonaceous structures with differing degrees of crystallinity.50 Furthermore, the peaks centered at 21°
have also been attributed to aliphatic structures in coal,53 which is inconsistent with our findings from 13C NMR analysis (Figure 2). They have also been attributed to disorder in sp2 carbons54 and to stacked aromatic
layers with perpendicular crystallites.55 The shoulder centered at 10° (2θ) or q = 0.7 Å–1 is, to the best of our knowledge,
not usually discussed for porous aromatic carbonaceous solids such
as activated carbons. A peak in that position can result from oxygen
functional groups in (and water between) aromatic carbon layers,56 which is typical for graphite oxide and consistent
with our findings from elemental analysis and FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, amorphous solids, similar to graphite
oxide and more or less reduced graphite oxide, can exhibit WAXS peaks
at similar positions (2θ ≈ 10, 21, and 42°) as observed
for MHH-2 and MHH-4.57−61

Textural Properties Derived from Gas Adsorption/Desorption and
Scanning Electron Microscopy
As mentioned, MHH-4 was more
porous than MHH-2, cf. Table 1, and the corresponding N2 sorption isotherms in Figure 4 show large and steep
uptake of N2 at low relative pressures (p/p0), which is typical for micropores.62 They also display an almost linear region of
adsorption of N2 at intermediate levels of p/p0 and an increased adsorption as p/p0 approaches 1. The adsorption
of N2 does not reach a plateau for increasingly high values
of p/p0, which indicates
that MHH-2 and MHH-4 contained macropores or consisted of small particles.62,63 The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms in Figure 4 show slight hysteresis at p/p0 of 0.8–1 for both
MHH-2 and MHH-4. Hysteresis is typically related to adsorption metastability,
capillary condensation, network effects, swelling, pore blocking,
and the shapes of the pores.62,64 In relation to these
N2 adsorption isotherms, pore size distributions and cumulative
pore volumes were calculated using a density functional theory (DFT)
method. These are presented in Figures S10 and S11. To estimate the volume of small pores, the Dubinin–Radushkevich
(DR) method was used to determine the ultramicropore volumes, using
CO2 sorption data recorded at 0 °C. MHH-4 and MHH-2
had ultramicropore volumes of 0.39 and 0.25 cm3/g (see Figure S12 and Supporting calculations), respectively.
As was expected, the ultramicropore volumes failed to fully agree
with the micropore volumes (as was determined with the t-plot method using N2 adsorption data). CO2 is effectively smaller than N2 within sorbents, and the
models and the pressure ranges used were different.

Figure 4 N2 uptake
at −196 °C on microporous humins
derived from HMF at 200 and 400 °C (MHH-X).

The microporous humins consisted of aggregated and interconnected
particles with characteristic sizes of 10–100 nm as can be
seen from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figures 5, S13, and S14. Cavities and channels had formed among the aggregated
particles, and the interconnections appeared broadly distributed with
respect to size and shape. The particle sizes were significantly smaller
than the droplet size of the atomized HMF. Tentatively, the small
sizes of the particles were assigned to features of the phase separation
induced by the addition of diethyl ether. Carbon-rich solids, produced
in different manners, such as carbon-coated counter electrodes,65 fuel cell cathodes,66 graphene oxide composites,67 carbon black,68 silicon carbide,69 and soot,54 have been shown to have comparable
morphologies to those seen for MHH-2 and MHH-4. Such small and interconnected
particles can, speculatively, enhance the mass transport rates important
to various applications. Note that the SEM analyses of MHH-2 and MHH-4
showed charging, which is indicative of low conductivities.70,71

humins derived from HMF at (a) 200 and (b) 400 °C (MHH-X). The
scale bars at the bottom right of each image correspond to 100 nm.

Gas Uptake and Selectivity
Compared with porous polymers
(Table S372−82), MHH-4 showed the highest reported uptakes of CO2 at
0.15 bar and 0 °C (2.18 mmol/g), as shown in Figure 6. This low-pressure uptake
was also comparable to some of the highest uptakes of activated carbons
(Table S3). The CO2 uptake at
1 bar at 0 °C (5.27 mmol/g) was on par with some of the best
porous polymers but lower than those of certain activated carbons
(Table S3), zeolites, and metal–organic
frameworks.83,84 The uptake of CH4 was
relatively high for MHH-4, with a value of 2.09 mmol/g at 0 °C
and 1 bar. For MHH-2, the corresponding uptakes of CO2 and
CH4 were somewhat lower, with values of 3.20 and 1.06 mmol/g
at 0 °C and 1 bar. The CO2 isotherms for MHH-2 and
MHH-4 displayed slight hysteresis at intermediate pressures, which
closed on high and low pressures of CO2. The uptakes of
N2 at 0 °C and 1 bar were 0.34 and 0.77 mmol/g for
MHH-2 and MHH-4, respectively. The CO2 and N2 sorption isotherms recorded at 50 °C are shown in Figure S15.

Adsorption-driven capture of CO2 could potentially
be
less expensive than scrubbing technologies for CO2 capture
and is hence researched for potential implementation.79 To evaluate the prospects of such capture, it is important
to measure or estimate the binary adsorption of CO2 from
gas mixtures. As it is time consuming and experimentally difficult
to measure binary adsorption isotherms, various methods have been
developed to estimate the binary adsorption from the single-component
adsorption data. The ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST)85 is one of the well-established methods.

The binary selectivites were estimated for the microporous humins
with the IAST method, and the CO2-over-N2 selectivities
in Figure 7a at 0 °C
are higher for MHH-4 than that for MHH-2. At ptot = 1 bar, the selectivity increased from 37 up to 65 for
MHH-4 on increasing yCO2. At ptot = 0.1 bar, the selectivity stayed largely
independent of yCO2. We refrain
from speculating whether this difference is explained by physical
reasons or if it is related to the mechanics of the IAST method. IAST
has several limitations. These include assumptions of ideal mixing
and that the adsorptive uptake of the least interactive gas needs
to be integrated over quite a large pressure range, when the selectivity
is high. Often, the high-pressure uptake of the least interacting
gas is not measured, and hence, regression models are applied to predict
the high-pressure adsorption data. Such regression analyses and integrations
were performed for the IAST selectivities of this study. Consequently,
the binary selectivities presented in Figure 7 at ptot = 1
bar are less robust than those of 0.1 bar. In contrast to the order
observed at a temperature of 0 °C, the selectivity was higher
for MHH-2 than that for MHH-4 at a temperature of 50 °C. At ptot = 1 bar and yCO2 = 0.15 (relevant for postcombustion capture of CO283), the selectivity was ∼19
for MHH-4 (see Figure 7b). MHH-2, on the other hand, had for these p–T–yCO2 conditions
a selectivity of ∼28. The selectivities for MHH-2 and MHH-4
were higher than those for most activated carbons. Related values
for the CO2-over-N2 selectivity for other sorbents
have been discussed elsewhere79,82,86,87 and are presented in Table S3.

°C, (c) CO2-over-CH4 selectivity, and (d)
CH4-over-N2 selectivity at 0 °C. IAST was
used. MHH-X denotes microporous humins derived from HMF at 200 or

Upgraded biogas has the
potential to be amongst the most sustainable
vehicle fuels88,89 if the waste biomass and the
involved processes are selected with care. The main operation of the
upgrading is to remove significant amounts of CO2. Such
CO2 removal can be performed by, for example, adsorption-driven
separation processes.88 Important properties
of the involved sorbents include the CO2-over-CH4 selectivity. Hence, the IAST selectivity was calculated from CO2 and CH4 adsorption data and presented in Figure 7c as a function of yCO2 at ptot = 0.1 and 1 bar. The selectivity for MHH-4 was ∼10, whereas
MHH-2 had higher values of 16–28. In the context of the upgrading
of biogas (and landfill gas), yCH4 is typically between 35 and 70% and yCO2 is between 15 and 40%.90 The reported selectivities of MHH-2 and MHH-4 were larger than those
for regular activated carbons but smaller than those of certain carbon
molecular sieves and zeolites. The CO2-over-CH4 selectivities for other adsorbents have been reviewed or presented
elsewhere.91−93

The CH4-over-N2 selectivity
metric is relevant
in the context of adsorption-driven upgrading of landfill gas and
natural gas, and selectivities for other sorbents have been presented
elsewhere.93,94 This metric was calculated for
MHH-2 and MHH-4 by using IAST and CH4 and N2 adsorption data and is presented in Figure 7d. The CH4-over-N2 selectivity
was between 3.8 and 4.2 for MHH-4 and around 2 for MHH-2. See the Supporting Information for further details.

The isosteric heat of the sorption of CO2 (Qst) is important to adsorption-driven separation of CO2 from gas mixtures. A high Qst value gives a high CO2 selectivity. A high Qst value is related to a strong intermolecular interaction
of CO2 with the electrical field gradients (EFGs) of these
internal surfaces of the sorbent. Hence, Qst of CO2 is connected to the pore size as well as the functional
groups on the surface.95,96 However, a high value of Qst also increases the regeneration cost of the
sorbent.97 Hence, for adsorption-driven
CO2 capture from flue gas mixtures, calculations have indicated
that Qst of 40–60 kJ/mol could
be optimal but other theoretical work has shown vague relationships
between Qst and the cost of CO2 capture operations.98−100 The loading-dependent Qst values for MHH-2 and MHH-4 were determined with differential
methods using temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 sorption
data and are presented in Figure 8. For MHH-4, Qst was 42–44
kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than those typical for microporous
polymers and activated carbons,78,95,96,101 as presented in Table S3. Qst of
MHH-2 was, on the other hand, typical for such sorbents with a value
of 30–34 kJ/mol. The loading dependencies were weak. Qst increased slightly for MHH-4 and decreased
for MHH-2 with increased loadings. This weak dependency indicated
a narrow distribution of EFGs, which is consistent with a low heterogeneity
of the surface structure.102,103 The high Qst values for MHH-4 likely result from narrow pores and,
to some extent, carbonyl functional groups. (See Supporting Information for calculations and Figures S16–S19 for CO2 isotherms determined
at different temperatures and the corresponding isosteres).

Conclusions
A new class of highly porous organic sorbents,
called microporous
humins, was synthesized with a new approach. Tiny droplets of HMF
were added rapidly to conc. H2SO4 and the formed
solids were subsequently treated with diethyl ether and heat. The
microporous humins had high Qst values
for sorption of CO2, large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas, and micropore volumes. The CO2-over-N2, CO2-over-CH4, and CH4-over-N2 selectivities were high and indicate potential usefulness
of the sorbents in gas separation processes. High Qst of sorption of CO2 for MHH-4 could be relevant
to further studies of this composition in relation to CO2 separation processes. The microporous humins contained aromatic
structures with oxygen heteroatoms and carbonyl functional groups
and no significant amounts of aliphatic groups. These structures were
consistent with dehydration, dehydrogenation, and/or aromatization
of HMF. The functional groups could be relevant to further surface
modification. Only small amounts of sulfur were included in the sorbents
and further studies on how to control the sulfur content or doping
with other elements could be warranted. The impact of washing/extraction
is seldom studied in the general class of porous polymers and it could
be relevant to further studies on the synthesis of microporous humins.
We also expect that other molecules than HMF could be polymerized
in a similar manner and that the process methodologies could be further
refined for upscale purposes. Currently, the cost of HMF is significant
but new and improved processes are under the development. This together
with the importance of HMF as a reaction intermediate and a potential
platform chemical give a considerable potential to develop further
the chemistry of HMF, both as a starting material (illustrated by
this work) and with HMF as an intermediate.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Sorbents from HMF
HMF (0.63 g) was heated
to 50 °C and subsequently atomized as tiny droplets (typically
30–100 μm in size, according to the supplier of the device)
and added to 10 mL of conc. H2SO4 under vigorous
stirring at a temperature of 50 °C. The mixture was kept under
vigorous stirring at this temperature for 24 h and subsequently cooled
down to room temperature. Diethyl ether was thereafter added carefully
under stirring to a total volume of 50 mL, while being cooled in a
water bath. The resulting suspension was centrifuged, and the liquid
phase was decanted. The procedure of adding diethyl ether and removing
the liquid phase was repeated twice. The sorbents were dried in a
flow of N2 and subsequently heated to temperatures of 200
or 400 °C, also in a flow of N2. The yields were calculated
by dividing the solid mass after heat treatment by the initial mass
of HMF. All reagents were of a high-purity grade and used as supplied,
unless otherwise stated.

Characterization
For elemental analysis,
combustion
analysis was used, and the samples were assumed to consist entirely
of C, H, N, O, and S. The mass of O was calculated by subtraction.

Solid-state CP 13C NMR spectra of MHH-2 (Figures 2 and S3) were recorded under conditions of magic angle spinning (MAS) using
the TOSS sequence. A Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer operating at a
frequency of 400 MHz for a frequency of 100.6 MHz for 13C was used and a 7 mm probe head was used. The MAS rate was 7 kHz,
and the contributions from 1H magnetization were lessened
by decoupling with 50 kHz during the acquisition of the 13C signals. Ramped CP for 1.6 ms was used to transfer magnetization
to 13C from 1H.

A Varian 670-IR spectrometer
with a Specac Goldengate attenuated
total reflection device was used to record the FTIR spectra. It was
equipped with a room-temperature deuterated triglycine sulfate detector.

Raman spectra were recorded with a HORIBA LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer
equipped with a double-frequency neodymium-doped yttrium–aluminum–garnet
laser (532 nm/50 mW) and an intracavity-regulated laser diode with
point source (785 nm/100 mW). The intensity of the lasers was adjusted
by using a software-controlled filter wheel with six neutral density
filters.

A PerkinElmer TGA 7 device was used for TGA in a flow
of dry air.
Approximately 3 mg of the sample in a platinum cup was placed inside
of the instrument and the weight was allowed to stabilize. Thereafter,
the temperature was raised by 1 °C/min, from 27–900 °C,
and the weight was recorded.

A PANalytical X’Pert alpha1
powder diffractometer was used
to record WAXS data from 2θ = 3.0°–80° in a
reflection mode with a PIXcel detector (Cu Kα1 radiation, k = 1.5406 Å). The q-values were calculated
according to q = (4π/k) sin(2θ/2).

SEM images were recorded using a JEOL JSM-7401F microscope equipped
with an in-lens secondary-electron column detector. A “gentle
beam” mode was used with a negative bias (−2 kV) applied
on the sample stage and a column accelerating voltage of 3 kV, generating
a landing energy corresponding to 1 kV. The powders were fixated by
using an ink. A working distance of 1.5 mm was used.

Adsorption
and desorption isotherms were measured in an absolute
pressure range of 0–101 kPa using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020
device. Prior to sorption measurements, the samples were degassed
at a temperature of 200 or 400 °C under conditions of dynamic
vacuum for 6 h N2 sorption isotherms were measured at temperatures
of −196, 0, and 50 °C. CO2 sorption isotherms
were measured at temperatures of 0, 10, 20, and 50 °C. CH4 sorption isotherms were measured at a temperature of 0 °C.
The BET104 model was used to calculate
the specific surface areas (SBET) using
the low-temperature (−196 °C) N2 uptake at p/p0 values of 0–0.084
for MHH-4 and 0–0.06 for MHH-2. The selected pressure range
assured that n(1 – p/p0) increased with p/p0 and that the BET parameter c was positive. The t-plot method (for carbon black
and p/p0 = 0.2–0.5)
was used to determine Sext and Vmic. Smic was calculated
as the difference between SBET and Sext.105,106Vt was determined at p/p0 = 0.98. Details regarding the calculations can be found
in the Supporting Information. A DFT-based
method, supplied by Micromeritics routines, was used to estimate pore
size distributions using the N2 adsorption data recorded
at a temperature of −196 °C. The ultramicropore volumes
were determined using the DR method and CO2 adsorption
data at a temperature of 0 °C, see Supporting Information for details. The IAST was used to calculate binary
selectivity from single-component adsorption data, see the Supporting Information for details. CO2 sorption isotherms were recorded at a temperature of 0 °C on
Micromeritics Gemini VII to verify the reproducibility of the synthesis.
