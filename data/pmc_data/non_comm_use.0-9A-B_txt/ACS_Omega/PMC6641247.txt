High dielectric constants
(εr) were observed in
two-dimensional composites obtained from stacking of reduced graphene
oxide (RGO) with Ca2Nb3O10 and with
TiO2 nanosheets. The relative dielectric permittivity values
of the composites were found to be higher than 105, an
amazingly high value compared to that of similar GO composites and
other common dielectric materials. As a consequence, we considered
application of the hybrids as super dielectric materials in high capacitance
supercapacitors. The route to high capacitance involves the variation
of oxygen vacancies within the surface and in the closest bulk interior
of the hybrids. The effective charges generated throughout the metal
oxide and carbon–oxygen polar bonding systems within the graphene
skeleton appear to highly influence dielectric polarization. Moreover,
the replenishment of oxygen vacancies at the RGO and metal oxide interface
also contributes to polarizability.

Introduction
Inorganic nanosheets
are attracting ongoing interest as, depending
on their chemical composition, they can behave as semiconductors,
insulators, or even conductors. Nanosheet insulators and semiconductors
possess wide band gap energies (3–5 eV)1,2 with
high thermal and chemical stabilities.3,4 Similar materials
including graphene, perovskites, and other two-dimensional (2D) metal
oxide materials have much appeal for use in electrochemical energy
storage systems,5,6 battery electrodes,7 and supercapacitors.8 The ease of fabrication and device application arises from the exfoliating
nature of oxide-based 2D nanostructures that include boron nitride,
metal disulfides, and so on.9,10 For example, a typical
material, KCa2Nb3O10, has a number
of potential applications that include ion conduction, photocatalysis,
and photoluminescence.11,12 Also, KCa2Nb3O10 is used on a large scale to synthesize 2D [TBAxH1–x]+[Ca2Nb3O10]− nanosheets13 for photochemical water
splitting14 and H2 production15 and as a potential nanodielectric conductor
material16,17 for building multijunction polymer solar
cells.18 In accord with these trends, herein,
we report an investigation aimed at applying a 2D calcium niobate
(CNO) nanosheet and its composites with graphene oxide (GO) and reduced
GO (RGO) as dielectric materials for use in capacitors. In addition,
we also report an investigation of the similar application of titanium
oxide (TiO2) nanosheet employing rutile (rather than anatase
or brookite) as it shows improved dielectric properties relative to
those of the other two forms of TiO2, viz. high dielectric
constant along with low dielectric loss.19 Also, rutile is thermodynamically more stable than the other two
forms.20 Pang et al. reported εr = ∼81 for bulk rutile when considering it for use
as a component in low-temperature cofired ceramics.21 Dielectric constant of organic–inorganic hybrid
composite have also been reported.22,23 As the dielectric
properties of composite materials depend on the dielectric constants
of the components, TiO2 nanoparticles with low disparity
and high dielectric permittivity were chosen for investigation in
the present study. The maximum εr value for TiO2 was found to be 63.7 at 850 °C by Wypych et al.24 A nano TiO2 bulk sample exhibited
a dielectric value in the range of 104 at 10 Hz.25 However, to the best of our knowledge, the dielectric
behavior of 2D composites of GO or RGO with CNO and TiO2 has not been studied so far.

We prepared KCa2Nb3O10-based 2D
nanosheets and TiO2 nanosheets (rather than bulk samples)
using chemical exfoliation and achieved very high dielectric constants
along with super capacitive properties besides obtaining RGO composites
of the above nanosheets for the first time. The choice of GO was based
on its poor electrical conductivity with large specific surface area
but good prospects for energy storage and generation capabilities.26,27 In this context, it is noted that graphene-based materials (graphene
oxide, reduced graphene oxide, and graphene) are receiving considerable
widespread attention due to special properties such as unique charge
carrier rates and/or heterogeneous electron transfer characteristics.28−30 Graphene-based materials have also been widely investigated as electrode
materials for use in supercapacitors. The use of graphene nanosheet
has been shown to yield the highest value of weight-specific capacitance
(550 F g–1), reflecting that the very high specific
surface area of 2675 m2 g–1 can be fully
utilized; the intrinsic capacitance of the graphene nanosheet has
been calculated to be 21 μF cm–2.31 In contrast to the above, in the present study,
we have investigated the use of a 2D graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet
for the first time (rather than graphene nanosheet) to prepare composite
2D metal oxide nanosheets to investigate their dielectric properties.
Enhancement of capacitance following thermal reduction was anticipated
because of the dependency of the specific capacitance of RGO on the
number of oxygen-containing groups on the surface, on the density
of defects present, on the electronic state of the carbon, and on
the electrical conductivity.

Results and Discussion
The scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of the (related)
morphologies of the metal oxide composites with GO and RGO are shown
in Figure 1. The images
show that aggregation of sheetlike structures occurs. The formation
of CNO, TiO2, and GO nanosheets also appears to be visible
in the atomic force microscope (AFM) images displayed in Figure S1. The height profiles show that the
thickness of the sheets lies within nanometer dimensions. Changes
after composite formation were evident from the Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Figure S2) and
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra (Figure S3). FT-IR spectra were in accord with stacking of the C–C,
C=C, and C–H bonds arising from the tetrabutylammonium
hydroxide (TBAH) treatment during exfoliation with nanosheets of TiO2 and CNO, which is the most probable reason for the lower
εr values obtained for pristine TiO2 and
CNO nanosheets when measured under similar conditions. Peaks of medium
intensity were present in both samples at 1655 and 1647 cm–1, respectively, and are assigned to C=C stretches. A band
for the aromatic C=C stretching frequency was present at 1435
cm–1 in the spectrum of the CNO/GO composite. In
addition, a peak at 1365 cm–1 in the spectrum of
CNO is tentatively assigned to the aliphatic C–H bending frequency.
Removal of −OH groups after reduction is indicated by the FT-IR
spectra because the broad peak at around 3500 cm–1 for polar hydroxyl groups disappeared after reduction (Figure S2b,d). As shown in Figure S2a, the strong and broad peaks centered at 3438 and
3409 cm–1 correspond to the O–H stretching
frequencies of polar −OH groups in CNO and CNO/GO, respectively.
The hydroxyl groups occurring in the CNO nanosheet appear to have
been “imported” from TBAH during exfoliation. Peaks
at 1065 and 1069 cm–1 are assigned to the C–O
groups in CNO and CNO/GO, respectively. In the case of the RGO composite
(Figure S2b), the disappearance of the
broad peak at ∼3500 cm–1 indicates the absence
of −OH groups.

Figure 1 Morphologies of (a) CNO/GO, (b) CNO/RGO, (c) TiO2/GO,
and (d) TiO2/RGO composites.

However, the peak at 1165 cm–1 is assigned
to
the C–O stretching frequency, whereas the medium peak at 1521
cm–1 is assigned to aromatic C=C groups.
Hence, some aromaticity may be sustained even after the thermal reduction
of CNO/GO to CNO/RGO. As shown in Figure S2c, the IR spectra of the TiO2 nanosheet and TiO2/GO composite show the presence of broad and strong peaks at 3411
and 3402 cm–1, respectively, for the O–H
stretching frequencies. Bands at 1060 and 1067 cm–1 are assigned to the C–O stretching frequencies. Weak bands
for the aliphatic C–H stretches occur at 2999 and 2988 cm–1 for TiO2 and TiO2/GO, respectively.
Peaks for aliphatic C=C stretching frequencies are present
at 1649 and 1652 cm–1 for the nanosheet and composite,
respectively. For the TiO2/GO composite, the aliphatic
C–H stretching frequency corresponds to the peak at 1387 cm–1. For the RGO composite (Figure S2d), two major peaks at 1573 and 1250 cm–1 arise from the aromatic C=C and C–O stretching frequencies,
respectively. The removal of hydroxyl groups from the surface of GO
and TiO2 nanosheet after thermal reduction is clear from
the absence of a broad peak in the region of 3500 cm–1.

The calculated values of εr (with respect
to frequency)
derived from the capacitance (Cp) values
measured by the LCR meter are listed in Tables 1 and 2 for TiO2 and CNO, respectively. The values of εr were
calculated using  where Cp is the
capacitance in faraday (F), d is the thickness of
the pellet employed in meters (m), A is the area
of the electrode (m2), and the value of ε0 of 8.854 × 10–12 F m–1 is
the dielectric constant of vacuum.

The values of d and A for all
pellet samples are given in Table S1, and
the frequency-dependent values of capacitance are tabulated in Table S2. Like other reported materials, dielectric
constants of the samples decrease with increasing frequency. All samples
show the maximum value of dielectric constant (εmax) at 20 Hz.

The data in Table 1 clearly shows that εr of the composites
is increased
compared to that of their components. The εmax increases
from 481 in TiO2 to 924 in TiO2/GO. Usually,
the relative permittivity of a material increases with increasing
surface charge polarizability, surface area, and confinement of surface
induced by a secondary layer of charge at the nearest bulk interior.
As the increase in εr is directly associated with
the increase in surface area, we carried out a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area measurement, the result of which is presented in Table 3. The surface area
of TiO2/GO at 26.38 m2 g–1 is larger than that of HTiO2 (20.32 m2 g–1). The increase in surface area is likely a consequence
of the weak physical interaction between the two components of the
hybrid. However, this weak interaction is the likely cause of an increase
in the interlayer distances. To investigate this possibility, the
layer separations in the materials were studied by powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) measurements The increase in interlayer distances is evident
from the data in Table 4. The interlayer distance increased from 10.48 Å for TiO2 to 14.43 Å for TiO2/GO. Thus, the surface
area of the hybrids increases significantly compared to that of the
components. Unlike that of pure RGO, the surface area of TiO2/GO dramatically increased and reached a value of 53.32 m2 g–1 after thermal reduction. The related interlayer
distance is 13.16 Å. The PXRD patterns are given in Figure S4. The removal of some extended oxygenated
sites during thermal annealing is responsible for the observed decrease
in layer separation.

As the polar functional groups of GO are lost on its
conversion
to RGO, repulsion between the layers of RGO decreases. But TiO2 itself being polar tends to bind the composite. The interlayer
distance in TiO2/RGO decreases apparently because the attractive
π–π stacking is stronger than the repulsive force
between the nanosheets in the hybrids. As we simply mixed GO and the
metal oxide nanosheet in a 1:1 ratio rather than assembling through
a layer-by-layer deposition method, the π–π stacking
is expected to take place through more open networks, which ultimately
results in the observed increase in surface area and value of εr.

In dielectric materials, electrical potential energy
is dissipated
usually in the form of heat. In a good capacitor made of a dielectric
placed between conductors, losses are very small, and in a poor capacitor,
the losses are large. Because of low band gap energy, single TiO2 layers face large leakage current. We also measured the dissipation
factor (D) related to leakage current by the same
LCR meter mentioned before, and our findings have been tabulated in Table S5. It was found that D values are comparatively lower in higher frequencies by prepared
TiO2 nanosheets and its composites with GO. Lower values
of D for TiO2/GO than those for TiO2 nanosheets at the same frequency depicted that the GO hybrid
could act as better dielectric materials by lower losses in the capacitor.
The RGO composite did not show any D value under
the same conditions, indicating that TiO2/RGO is the better
dielectric with no loss, neither by conduction electrons nor by dipole
relaxation.

Although the surface area of the CNO/RGO composite
was not so high
compared to that of its GO composite, it gave εmax of 6.25 × 105 at 20 Hz, which is 1 order of magnitude
higher than that for the CNO/GO composite (εmax =
2.32 × 104) and 104 times higher than that
for CNO (εmax = 49.52). Relatively lower defects
were found in the CNO/RGO composite on Raman analysis (Table S3), which is in accord with its lower
surface area. From Table 3, it is manifest that the surface area of intrinsic CNO is
lower to a great extent compared to that of intrinsic HTO2, which consequently resulted into CNO/RGO with much lower surface
area than that of the TiO2/RGO composite. Thus, increasing
the surface area of CNO could ultimately result in an increased surface
area of CNO/RGO, and this can be possible by more improved exfoliation
of H+ exchanged (HCa2Nb3O10) into more colloidal porous single layers on the intercalating action
of the tetra(butyl)ammonium ion because by the exfoliation and restacking
process exfoliated coiled nanosheets can show an increased surface
area.32

At higher frequencies, the
εr values of all of
the samples were observed to be lower, and even the εr values of the RGO composites were lower than those for the GO composites
in some cases, reflecting the higher dielectric loss at the higher
frequencies.

Polarizations usually respond to an electrical
field by shifting
masses around, which means masses must be accelerated and decelerated
through an elapsing time interval. Therefore, it is expected that
the mechanical response to a field will depend on the frequency of
the electrical field (i.e., how often per second it changes its sign).
At very high frequencies, all polarization mechanisms “die
out”, i.e., there is no response to an extremely high frequency
field. It is noted that surface charge polarization depends on the
defect and vacancy of charge-bearing groups present.

Large electronic
and ionic polarizations are responsible for the
dielectric behavior of TiO2 nanosheets. Previously, εr was found to decrease due to the oxidation of TiO2 nanoceramics.40 Following reduction,
when an external electric field (E) is applied, a
very strong internal electric field is generated that resulted in
a high value of the dielectric constant through strong deformation
of electric shells as well as strong polarization involving both the
metal centers and the oxygen ions. These can be assigned as space-charge
polarization because under the action of an external electric field,
both the positive and negative space charges on the interface move
toward the negative and positive poles of the electric field, respectively
(giving rise to the space-charge polarization). Polarization mechanisms
that may occur in metal oxide composites are illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Polarization mechanisms
that may occur at the interface of nanosheet
composites.

From the X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) (Figure 3), it is apparent that in the TiO2/GO composite the coordinatively
unsaturated oxygen (Oc) at 532.5 eV and lattice oxygen
(Ol) at 530.4 eV corresponded
to 75.54 and 24.46%, respectively. After reduction, in TiO2/RGO, Oc decreased to 32.65% (more than half), which created
many more interfacial oxygen vacancies. Thus, orientational polarization
of defect dipoles in an applied field is favored.40 In the case of metal ions present in metal oxides, the
oxygen vacancies merge in ionic bond formation, resulting in a change
in the lattice (bond angle, bond lengths) for the ionic bond participating
in orientational polarization. This effect ultimately facilitates
enhancement of dielectric polarization, which leads to a higher εr value.

Figure 3 XPS spectra of (a) O 1s of TiO2/GO, (b) O 1s
of TiO2/RGO, and (c) Ti 2p of GO and RGO composites with
the TiO2 nanosheet.

From the XPS profile, it is also clear that after reduction,
Ti4+ ions and a large number of oxygen vacancies are cogenerated
on the surface. The invariable Ti 2p oxidation state after reduction
(Figure 3c) implies
the loss of oxygen from surface functional groups, whereas the lattice
oxygen content remains almost unchanged. The difference in the extent
of polarization between interfacial and interior oxygenated sites
results in the formation of bond charge or space charge, which may
enhance the polarization through space-charge polarization. It is
noteworthy that ionic space charge is generated fundamentally from
the equilibrium of lattice defects involving the interface of interest.35,36

It was also obvious from our results that because of thermal
reduction
the GO composite was converted into the RGO composite bearing a considerable
number of defects.

Moreover, after reduction, the gross polarization
is enhanced by
introduction of orientational polarization and space-charge polarization
due to the generation of oxygen vacancies and space charges. This
increase in the overall enhanced polarization mechanism pathway possibility
provides an easier and quicker response by the polar ions for alignment
when an external electric field is applied, resulting in εr being raised to a higher value. Classical instances of these
phenomena are given by the low and high εr values
for C (diamond) and water, respectively. The εr value
of C is ∼5.7, where the dominant polarization is electronic.
On the other hand, the εr value for H2O is ∼80, where electronic, dipolar, and ionic polarizations
all contribute simultaneously.

The atomic percentages with corresponding
peak binding energies
from the O 1s scans for the composites are given in Table S3. The XPS profile of the CNO composite almost coincides
with that of the TiO2 composites. The Oc content
decreased in RGO/CNO to 45.1% from 51.6% in CNO/GO (Figure 4b,a and Table S4). The absence of a peak shift for the Nb 3d peaks
after reduction (Figure 4c) indicates an unchanged oxidation state of the metal ion. Compared
to that of TiO2/RGO, almost a 1 order lower εr value for CNO/RGO resulted from the lower atomic percentage
of coordinatively unsaturated oxygen Oc (i.e., oxygen in
functional groups). A lower oxygen vacancy in the RGO composite is
created by the removal of surface functional groups after reduction.

Figure 4 XPS spectra
of (a) O 1s for CNO/GO, (b) O 1s for CNO/RGO, and (c)
Nb 3d for GO and RGO composites with the CNO nanosheet.

In this work, Raman spectra have been utilized
to examine the structural
changes in GO and RGO composites (Figure S5). A band in the region of 1580 cm–1 is generally
assigned to the sp2 carbon bond, and a D band around 1350
cm–1 is ascribed to disordered and local defects,
especially for defects at the edges.31 The
calculated values of the intensity ratios of the D and G bands (ID/IG) are listed
in Table S4. It is well known that if the
defects contain a graphite structure with disorder occurring at the
edges to reduce the size of the sp2 clusters, the ID/IG ratio will
be higher.37 In the case of the CNO composites,
the ID/IG ratio
decreased from 0.89 in the CNO/GO composite to 0.84 in the CNO/RGO
composite in keeping with lower defects in the graphitized structure
containing disorders at the edges and sp2 bonds involving
carbon atoms being increased in the RGO composite. These findings
are in accordance with the formation of aromatic carbon rings.

In the case of the titanium dioxide nanosheet composites, the ratio
increased to 0.91 for the RGO composite, which is marginally larger
than that of the GO composite for which the ratio was 0.86. Thus,
clearly, there are an increased number of defects in the TiO2/RGO composite compared to those in the TiO2/GO composite,
resulting in a decrease in the number of sp2 carbon clusters.

A rectangular shape of the cyclic voltammogram (CV) is a characteristic
of promising materials for use in a super capacitive application,32 and it is clear from Figures 5 and 6 that the CV
curves obtained by us became more “rectangular” during
the gradual conversion: GO → GO hybrid → RGO hybrid.
The insignificant amount of faradic current displayed by the CNO/RGO
samples (Figure 5c)
and TiO2/RGO (Figure 6c) indicates that double-layer capacitance37 is predominating over pseudocapacitance in the
case of the RGO hybrids.

CNO/RGO composite
at different scan rates.

Figure 6 CVs of (a) TiO2, (b) TiO2/GO composite, and
(c) TiO2/RGO composite at different scan rates.

The overall increase in capacitance is a consequence
of the reduction
process on the hybrids. Although thermal reduction of the GO composite
reduced the oxygen functional groups with a loss of pseudocapacitance,
the decrease in oxygen functional groups led to the enhancement of
the electrical conductivity and electrical double-layer capacitance.

The extraordinarily high capacitance was corroborated by repeating
the measurement using a “Solartron 1296 Dielectric Interface”.
Successful reproduction of data was achieved. In a repeat experiment,
the εr of TiO2 was determined without
Pt sputtering to discover the effect of the Pt casting on the measured
εr value. In this case, the area of the pellets was
calculated rather than the area of the electrode. At 10 Hz, the calculated
εr of a TiO2/GO pellet was 6.24 ×
101, whereas TiO2/GO/Pt showed a εr value of 1.11 × 102. This observation indicates
that without Pt sputtering, the εr value for TiO2/GO was 1 order of magnitude lower. In the case of the TiO2/RGO/Pt assembly, this effect is larger. The TiO2/RGO and TiO2/RGO/Pt samples gave ε values of 5.38
× 105 and 5.53 × 107, respectively,
at 10 Hz.

The same pellet of TiO2/GO without Pt sputtering
was
annealed at 300 °C in a N2 atmosphere, and the value
of εr obtained at 10 Hz was 5.38 ×105, which is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that before annealing.
However, the TiO2/GO/Pt pellet under the same conditions
gave 9.29 × 107 after annealing, which is 5 orders
of magnitude higher than that exhibited by the same pellet with Pt
before annealing. It is thus clear that the effect of annealing on
enhancing the dielectric constant of the metal oxide nanosheet composite
with the GO nanosheet predominates over the effect of Pt sputtering
on both major surfaces of the pellet samples. Dielectric properties
of GO and RGO were also measured under the same conditions as a control
experiment. It was found that GO showed a dielectric constant of 1.50
× 103, whereas after annealing (under the same conditions
of metal oxide hybrid with GO), the pellet of only GO (without metal
oxide) detached unlike conversion into the RGO pellet sample of the
hybrid to be able to measure dielectric properties by following similar
conditions. These findings also revealed the importance of metal oxide
to give a good mechanical rigidity to the hybrids even after annealing
with GO. We also confirmed that undertaking the measurement of capacitance
in a vacuum had no effect on the calculated εr values;
moreover, there was no significant difference whether the area of
the pellet or of the electrode was used for the calculation of εr from capacitance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
prepared calcium niobate and titanium dioxide
nanosheet composites with GO and RGO by a very facile method for the
first time as new dielectric materials suitable for use in capacitors.
We found that the maximum value of dielectric permittivity was on
the order of 106 and 105 for TiO2/RGO and CNO/RGO, respectively. These values are extraordinarily
high and to the best of our knowledge higher than those of any other
RGO composite of 2D metal oxide nanosheets reported to date. We propose
that the polar behavior of titanium dioxide and defects as well as
oxygen vacancies on the surface of RGO all played cooperative roles
in increasing the net dipole moments of the RGO composites by providing
more paths for polarization. Present evidence indicates that these
composites are very promising new dielectric materials for use in
energy storage systems including capacitors and as super dielectric
materials.

Experimental Section
CNO was obtained from KCa2Nb3O10. First, bulk KCa2Nb3O10 was prepared
by a minor modification to the method reported by Jacobson and co-workers.31 Nanosheets were obtained using the process reported
by Ebina and co-workers.13 A stoichiometric
mixture of K2CO3, CaCO3, and Nb2O5 (K2CO3 in 10% molar excess)
was ground for 30 min and then heated gradually to 1200 °C and
maintained at this temperature for 22 h. The resulting KCa2Nb3O10 (2 g) was mixed with 5 M HNO3 (200 mL) to obtain the exfoliated nanosheets. The solution was kept
for a week with continuous stirring at 250 rpm, culminating in the
conversion of KCa2Nb3O10 to HCa2Nb3O10·1.5H2O (protonic
oxide), which was isolated by filtration. HCa2Nb3O10·1.5H2O (1.33 g) was dispersed in aqueous
tetra-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) (430 mL) at a molar ratio of
1:1. The solution was stored for 4 days to yield calcium niobate oxide
(Ca2Nb3O10) nanosheets through chemical
exfoliation.

TiO2 was obtained from cesium titanate
(Cs0.67Ti1.83O4). A mixture of Cs2CO3 (4.35 g) and TiO2 (rutile powder)
(5.65 g) was
ground and then heated at 800 °C for 24 h. The calcination procedure
was repeated once after again grinding the initial product for 10
min. The product cesium titanate (2.0 g) was powdered and mixed at
250 rpm with 1 M HCl at room temperature for 2 days to obtain the
protonic form of the titanate (H0.67Ti1.83O4). During this proton exchange reaction, the HCl solution
was replaced with fresh solution after 1 day. After washing (3×)
with distilled water, HTiO2 was dried overnight at 50 °C.
The dry powder (0.5 g) obtained was mixed with 918 mL of 25 mM TBAH
solution and allowed to stand for 2 weeks for exfoliation to occur.
The amount of TBAH employed corresponded to the equivalent quantity
of exchangeable protons in H0.67Ti1.83O4·H2O for effective exfoliation to take place.38

GO was synthesized from graphite powder
by a modification of Hummer’s
method.39 Hybrids of GO were prepared by
simply mixing GO with CNO or TiO2 in 1:1 ratio (by weight).
The HCl (0.1 M) solution was added dropwise to the mixture until the
precipitation of nanosheet composite was completed. The composite
was then freeze-dried overnight. The RGO composites were generated
through thermal reduction by annealing the GO composites at 300 °C
under a N2 flow for 2 h.

The morphologies of the
respective samples were analyzed employing
a JEOL-7600F field emission-SEM. The formation of the nanosheets was
checked by AFM using a LB instrument (model USI-3-22WKI). To determine
interlayer distances, all powdered samples were characterized by PXRD
using a Rigaku, SmartLab X-ray diffractometer, 3 kW ARGI. The surface
areas of the nanosheets and composites were obtained by BET measurement
using a Tri Star II 3020 analyzer through adsorption of N2 gas onto the surface of samples at 50 °C. The capacitances
of the nanosheet compositions were measured at different frequencies
using a precision LCR meter (Agilent E4980A). During the measurement,
Pt electrodes were positioned on both sides of pellet samples of 2
cm diameter using a sputtering procedure by means of an electric sputter
device (Edwards, EXT 75DX 24V dc). Raman spectra were measured on
a Jasco NRS-3100 laser Raman spectrophotometer. XPS measurements were
carried out on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation (Theta Probe
A1472) XPS spectrometer.

All electrochemical investigations
of the composites were carried
out using a three-electrode cell system and a ALS/[H] CHI 1200B potentiostat.
A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were chosen as the counter electrode and reference
electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by “casting”
the sample onto a glassy carbon (GS) electrode. Samples were first
REG in distilled water and then dried under vacuum after casting onto
the GS electrode tip. The measurements were carried out in 2 M H2SO4 as electrolyte. CVs of the samples were performed
on an electrochemical analyzer (ALS/[H] CHI model 1200B) and were
measured to evaluate the capacitive charge–discharge processes.
Before each measurement, the electrolyte solution was thoroughly deoxygenated
by bubbling Ar gas.
