We show that the
use of reversibly connected trialdehyde cores
and diamine hydrophilic/hydrophobic connectors may generate libraries
of dynameric frameworks of variable composition. The dynamic reversible
imine- and trans-imination reactions induce the progressive segregation
of libraries consisting of homo- and heterodynameric frameworks through
the constitutional selection and successive precipitation of low-soluble
hydrophobic films and hydrophilic/hydrophobic core–shell particles.
This “precipitation-driven segregation” results in the
formation of membrane with unique asymmetric morpholgy. Systematic
compositional changes of dynamers, segregating solvents, and casting
surfaces were correlated with the emerged membrane structure, and
NMR/transmission electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray
characterizations mostly supported their hypothesis.

Introduction
Chemical synthesis
by design produces a vast number of complex
materials. Various approaches have been proposed to design self-assembled
materials, and supramolecular chemistry has played an important role
in this exploration.1,2 Constitutional synthesis by selection
provides an evolutional approach for the generation of adaptive materials.
Most scenarios are related to the self- and target driven- selection
of the optimal structures from dynamic libraries. By combining reversible
covalent bonds with supramolecular interactions, constitutional dynamic
chemistry, covering the systems emerging by selection, enables the
synthesis of materials with unexpected topologies and functions.3 However, only very few materials resulted from
the constitutional selection of dynamic phases have been reported
to date. Moreover, the general mechanistic criteria explaining the
emergence of such hierarchical dynamic materials are lacking.

As a result of reversibility, the mixtures of the library can interconvert
to give a complex distribution of components under thermodynamic control.
Addition of stimuli that selectively interact with one component of
the library or irreversible phase change processes will result in
one component at the expense of the others in the mixture. This has
been evaluated at a molecular level, while libraries of polymeric
networks have not been studied yet. Our studies presented here provide
the first insight into the constitutional selection of dynameric frameworks
at a macromolecular level.

Dynamic polymers—dynamers
have emerged as a new class of
materials with adaptive behaviors.4−10 Their responsive features direct the amplification of components
arising from the dynamic libraries of monomers in response to internal
structural pressure or applied external stimuli to give rise to interconnected
domains of specific compositions and properties.

We have recently
discovered that hydrophobic/hydrophilic (HP/HY)
agonist monomers can be used for the preparation of asymmetric membranes
for directional water transport.11 1,3,5-Benzenetrialdehyde 1, core-center, HY 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecane-diamine 2, and HP 1,12-diamino-dodecane 3 have been connected
via reversible amino-carbonyl/imine chemistry, resulting in the formation
of various dynameric frameworks in solution (Scheme 1). This work built on the preliminary observation
showed that the incorporation of both HP and HY is crucial for the
phase-segregation process under the pressure of their internal structural
affinity, while the inclusion of only one HP or HY partly afforded
a membrane of similar sides.11 A solvent
plays an important role in the extent of phase segregation: acetonitrile
(CH3CN) proved to be the most efficient segregating solvent
among others (CHCl3, THF, etc.), leading to asymmetric
membranes. At this point, the overall structural membrane formation
pathways and the mechanism were unknown. In this paper, we give in-depth
understanding of the dynamic phase-segregation mechanism, leading
to the formation of asymmetric membranes.

of a Library of an Exchanging Homodynamers 1·2 and 1·3 and Heterodynamer 1·2·3
Results and Discussion
Within this context, complete investigations on the role of the
component mixture or the nature of the casting surface on dynamic
selection mechanisms have been performed. They are based on sequential
emergence of distinct low-soluble homomeric HP films and heteromeric
HP/HY microparticles from dynameric libraries, followed by the formation
of asymmetric membrane films.

1H NMR spectroscopy
has been used to follow the equilibrium
occurring in CD3CN solution at 60 °C for the formation
of homodynamers 1·2 and 1·3 and of heterodynamer 1·2·3 (Figure 1). A white precipitate began
to form in the NMR tube after 10 min at 60 °C. The experiment
has been followed by the decrease of peaks at 2.5−2.8 ppm,
corresponding to the −CH2NH2 protons
and first monitoring the consuming of 2 and 3, while the emerging imine peaks at 8.0−8.5 ppm end up with
two simplified peaks from 1·2 (Figure S4). The fact that the decreasing rate of the HP 3 peak is faster than that of the HY 2 peak suggests
that HP homodynamer 1·3 precipitates from the solution
prior to HY homodynamer 1·2 or hybrid heterodynamer 1·2·3. It means that coupling of the dynamic exchanges
of dynamers in the library to an irreversible phase change/precipitation
process drives the library out of equilibrium through the progressive
formation of distinct HP and the HP/HY phases until the building blocks
are consumed.12−14

To confirm the hypothesis of precipitation-driven
segregation,
we conducted experiments in CH3CN by casting the solution
on HP Teflon, M1, or HY glass M2 surfaces.
A similar elemental distribution between M1 and M2 in energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was observed
on the two sides of membranes (Table 1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed
compacted dense bottom surfaces obtained by casting on glass, whereas
porous microparticle patterns are obtained by casting on Teflon (Figure S8).

Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) experiments with dynamer 1·2·3 (1:0.75:0.75) in CH3CN solution showed particles of a
diameter of 300 nm, whereas the particle size for dynamer 1·2 (1:1.5) is around 1 μm, and only precipitates were detected
for dynamer 1·3 (1:1.5), suggesting the tendency
of forming core–shell microparticles for the HY part and the
precipitation-driven membrane formation process. Another test was
performed by changing the solvent from CH3CN, M1 to CHCl3, M3 and using a Teflon template.
We observed better solubility of homodynamer 1·3 in CHCl3 that diminishes the segregation effects initiated
via its precipitation. As a result, EDX gave a similar elemental distribution
between the two sides for all the elements for M3 (Table 1). The SEM images
showed completely flat and compact surfaces from both sides (Figure S8). Therefore, the solubility of reversibly
generated dynamers is directly related to the phase segregation, providing
asymmetric membranes with mainly HP dynamers on the bottom side and
HY dynamers on the top side surface.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) has been used for a more
precise EDX elemental distribution analysis. We detected a gradual
decreasing ratio of N/O from 67 to 48% along the cross section of
the membrane M1 (Figure 2), clearly demonstrating the increasing amount of O-containing
HY part (2) from one side to the other side of the film.

elemental distributions of N and O along the cross section of the
membrane. We note that only N and O elements are considered.

After understanding the solubility
effects on the dynamic phase
segregation, the membranes M4–M7 with different
HY·HP 2/3 molar ratios were further
prepared from CH3CN and casted on Teflon. The EDX results
showed that with an increased amount of HP 3, the differences
of the elemental distribution of C % and O % between the two sides
were getting larger and larger as expected: more C % (HP) and less
O % (HY) accumulated at the bottom (Table 2). These results have proven again that the
lower solubility of homodynamer 1·3 induced its
prioritized precipitation at the bottom. The SEM micrographs of M4–M7 showed that the top side of all films was presented
as porous structures, whereas the bottom side surfaces are flat and
dense, containing a higher amount of HP 3 (Figure 3).

Highly regular microparticles
could be observed at the bottom side,
especially when diamines 2 and 3 were both
used. The EDX data indicated that these microparticles contain both
HY/HP. Increasing the amount of HP 3, the diameter of
the microparticles decreases such that the bottom side of the membrane
turned to be more densely packed, resulting in the formation of smaller
pores.

These results have proven that dynamic reversible exchanges
occurred
in solution via reversible imine formation and trans-imination reactions,
with the possibility of forming all potential cross-linked frameworks
(1·2, 1·2·3, and 1·3). This equilibrium occurred in solution until the formation of a
HP low-soluble film 1·3 on the bottom part of the
membrane. Then, the total concentration of 3 decreased,
and the remaining nonprecipitating colloidal particles of 1·3 formed as a nucleation central core, which may further be surrounded
by a HY shell of 1·2 or 1·2·3 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Proposed mechanism
of segregation in a two-component system: the
HP 1·3 dynamers form a low-soluble thin film (red)
on the bottom part of the membrane and of hybrid microparticles, prompting
the self-assembly of the HY units of 1·2 or 1·2·3 (blue corona) around HP (red core) 1·3.

The resulted formation of microparticles
prompted the self-assembly
of the HY units of 1·2 or 1·2·3 around the HP core of 1·3. An average microparticle
diameter do indeed appear to be correlated with the concentration
of 3; as expected, the growth of particles is more efficient
when it is distributed over a smaller number of HP nucleation centers
at the low concentration of 3, producing bigger particles
and higher porosity in M4 (Figure 3a–c), whereas the high concentration
of the colloidal HP core of 1·3 resulted in the
production of smaller HY·HP microparticles and lower porosity
in M7 (Figure 4j–l).

Finally, the membranes M4 and M7 were
further applied to the water transport tests. The water permeabilities
from top to bottom sides of membrane M4 were 1434 and
564 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, respectively, whereas those of membrane M7 were 1854
and 1332 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, respectively. The higher permeability difference, almost triple,
between the top and bottom of membrane M4 may mainly
come from the asymmetric highly porous and dense morphological differences
because their elemental distributions between the top and bottom were
similar. By increasing the amount of HP 3, the top side
of the membrane got less porous structures, whereas the bottom side
was kept as a packed surface, leading to a lower difference for water
permeability, despite the evident difference between the elemental
distributions of the two HP and HY sides of the M7 membrane.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that a library of dynameric HP/HY
agonist building blocks can emerge via phase changes/precipitation
processes, resulting in the formation of asymmetric membranes composed
of bottom HP thin layers and of top core–shell HP/HY microparticles.
Our results were supported by 1H NMR, EDX, SEM, and DLS,
and the uneven elemental distribution of the membranes was confirmed
to come from the synergetic incorporation of HY/HP components, driven
by precipitation rates.

The hierarchical self-assembly process
involves reversible covalent
and noncovalent assemblies. This process is controlled at the molecular
level, leading to a HP/HY gradient from the bottom to the top of the
membrane. Moreover, the membrane porosity can be controlled through
the size of the core–shell HP/HY microparticles, progressively
decreasing with the increasing amount of the HP component. Systematic
modifications on the ratios of the HY/HP components led to the membranes
with controlled but different water permeabilities between the two
sides of the membranes.

This work provided an insight into the
simple and direct formation
of asymmetric membranes with complex hierarchical structures via phase
segregation of dynameric exchanging frameworks.
