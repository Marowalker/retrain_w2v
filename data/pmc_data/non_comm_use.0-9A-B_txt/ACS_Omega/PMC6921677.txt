Diclofenac or 2-[(2′,6′-dichlorophenyl)amino]phenyl}acetic
acid (dcf) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug,
and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) is a well-known enzyme
inhibitor. In this study, three new alkali metal complexes (1–3) containing both phen and dcf were prepared, and their structures were characterized
by a variety of analytical techniques including infrared and UV–vis
spectroscopy, 1H NMR and 13C NMR elemental analysis,
mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
In these complexes, phen binds via a N,N′-chelate pocket, while the monoanionic dcf—ligand remains either uncoordinated (in the case
of 1 and 3) or coordinated in a bidentate
fashion (in the case of 2). All three complexes crystallize
in the triclinic space group P-1. [Na2(phen)2 (H2O)4][dcf]2 (1) is a dinuclear sodium complex, where two
crystallographically identical Na+ cations adopt a distorted
five-coordinate spherical square-pyramidal geometry, with a [N2O3] donor set. [K2(phen)2(dcf)2(H2O)4] (2) is also a dinuclear complex where the crystallographically
unique K+ cation adopts a distorted seven-coordinate geometry
comprising a [N2O5] donor set. [Li(phen)(H2O)2][dcf] (3)
is a mononuclear lithium complex where the Li+ cation adopts
a four-coordinate distorted tetrahedral geometry comprising a [N2O2] donor set. The complexes were evaluated for
their anticancer activity against lung and oral cancer cell lines
as well as for their antibacterial potential. The prepared complexes
displayed very good antibacterial and anticancer activities with an
excellent bioavailability.

Introduction
Cancer morbidity and mortality is a worldwide
phenomenon claiming 70% of the deaths out of 9.6 million deaths worldwide
among low- and middle-income countries.1 More than 60% of new emerging cancer cases are centered in Asian
countries. Besides cancer, emerging antimicrobial-resistant pathogens
are considered to be a major threat. The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant
pathogens is likely to develop into a major health concern by 2050.2 The efficacy of existing drugs is reducing globally
day by day against bacterial pathogens because of the rise of antimicrobial
resistance.3 Different factors play a crucial
role for the development of resistance such as multispecies biofilm
modes of growth, genetic swapping, and mutation.4 The increasing resistance of certain cancer lineages and
microbial pathogens to existing treatments is proving a major challenge.5 This situation requires exploring new stable
chemical entities with better antimicrobial potential and less toxicity.
In this respect, the coordination complexes received considerable
attention because of their potential applications in the field of
medicinal chemistry.6

Metal complexes
interact with intracellular biomolecules and exhibit enzyme inhibition.7 They increase lipophilicity, affect alteration
of cell membrane functions, and arrest cell cycle.8 In cancer chemotherapy, cisplatin and other platinum coordination
compounds are among the most successfully used anticancer drugs.9 Among coordination complexes, Schiff base complexes
with first row transition and inner transition metals have been extensively
studied for their potential in cancer therapy.10 Much effort focused on transition metals, while anticancer
studies on the complexes containing alkali metals are still unknown.
These metal ions play a vital role in various biological pathways
such as cellular diversity, partition, apoptosis, homeostasis, adjusting
electrolyte balances, pH, and nerve impulses.11 The role of potassium and sodium concentration in cancer growth
risk is the most important subject in cancer research.12,13 Significant levels of sodium concentration have been found in cancer
cells as compared to normal cells of the identical tissue,14 while potassium on the other hand can offer
a better solution for cancer immunotherapy.13 Lithium ions are more efficient in facilitating many vital processes
and cellular pathways by efficient penetration through cellular membranes.15 Lithium has been used extensively for the therapeutic
treatment of mood disorders.15,16 Lithium can modify
the biochemical functions of transcription factors, leading to important
physiological or pathophysiological functions in cancer research.17

In the current study, three new alkali
metal complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and {2-[(2′,6′-dichlorophenyl)amino]phenyl}acetate
(dcf) are reported (Figure 1). phen is a well-known N-donor
ligand with predictable coordination chemistry, offering a N,N′-chelate pocket for metal ions
and is often employed with a range of O-donor coligands to produce
a range of complexes with different structural topologies.18−20phen is also a well-known enzyme inhibitor.21−23 The potassium and sodium salts of dcf (commonly known
as diclofenac) are well-known nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs.24 The coordination chemistry of dcf and phen with transition metals is known;25,26 however, to date, no reports are published on alkali metal complexes
with phen/dcf mixed ligand systems. As a
continuation of our search for new potential bioactive compounds,27 we have sought to combine the established enzyme
inhibition properties of phen with the anti-inflammatory
properties of dcf through the development of structurally
well-defined alkali metal complexes of phen/dcf as potentially bioactive compounds. Specifically, we were interested
in the anticancer and antibacterial activities of selected alkali
metal complexes. We have investigated the reactions of phen with dcf–M+ (M = Na, K) and described the structures of the dinuclear complexes
of both [Na2(phen)2(H2O)4][dcf]2 (1) and
[K2(phen)2(dcf)2(H2O)4] (2) (Figure 1), while in the presence of
LiCl, a mononuclear complex {[Li(phen)(H2O)2](dcf)} (3) was isolated. The structures
of 1–3 were analyzed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, and a detailed description of their crystal structures
is described.28 The bulk compositions were
confirmed by 1H NMR, elemental analysis, and infrared (IR)
spectroscopy. The anticancer activities against lung and oral cancer
cell lines and antibacterial activity were also performed to check
their therapeutic potential.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Reactions of phen with dcf–M+ (M = Na, K) in MeOH produced
dinuclear complexes of both sodium (1) and potassium
(2). In the presence of LiCl, a mononuclear lithium complex
(3) was isolated (Figure 1). All three complexes were characterized by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, UV–vis and IR spectroscopy,
and mass spectrometry (MS) (ESI+). Single crystals were
grown directly from the mother liquor.

Analytical Data and Spectral Characterization
Complexes 1–3 were obtained in good yield (80–85%)
in an analytically pure form. Compounds 1–3 melt between 230 and 283 °C. The complexes are soluble
in water, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The crystals of
complex 1 proved slightly hygroscopic, absorbing small
quantities of water upon standing, but otherwise all three complexes
appeared to be air stable. In all cases, the empirical formula and
composition of the products could be easily established from the analytical
data.

Fourier Transform IR
The IR spectra of complexes 1–3 are presented in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, where the broad peaks
(2920–3619 cm–1) are due to the O–H
stretching frequency, which is broadened because of hydrogen bonding.
The carbonyl peaks fall in the range 1590–1650 cm–1, in good agreement with literature examples.36 The peaks in the range 1512–1515 cm–1 reflect the presence of the heterocyclic phen C–N stretching
in the complexes.37

UV–Vis
Attempts to measure the UV–vis
data for complexes 1–3 in noncoordinating
solvents were hampered by insolubility. As a consequence, the UV–vis
data for complexes were measured in water. The UV–vis spectra
of 1–3 are dominated by intense π–π*
ligand-centered absorption bands at 225 and 265 nm, which are attributed
to phen-based transitions compared with that of the free
ligands (Figure S2). The increase of absorption
coefficient (ε) of complexes 1–3 (ε = 54 766–112 845 M–1 cm–1) compared to that of free ligands (εphen = 41 850) at 225 nm supports the suggestion that
these ligands remain coordinated in solution, with metal coordination
enhancing the extinction coefficient.

1H NMR and 13C NMR
NMR spectra
of molecules involved in a self-assembly process usually provide useful
information about the resulting structure of metal complexes in solution
because of upfield/downfield shifts in chemical shifts. In the case
of alkali metals, because of weak interaction with the ligand, this
shift is usually small compared to transition metal complexes. This
could be due to less paramagnetic character associated with alkali
metals. Attempts to record NMR data in noncoordinating solvents were
again hampered by the insolubility of complexes (vide supra); thus, 1H and 13C NMR spectra of free ligands and complexes 1–3 were recorded in DMSO-d6 (Figures S3–S4). On
comparing the peaks of phen and Na(dcf)
with those of complexes 1–3, it was
observed that all the signals of the free ligands are present in the 1H NMR spectra of the complexes, that is, four signals for
the phen and nine more signals for the dcf– protons. Integration assisted in the assignment
of the 1H NMR resonances and predicted that the ratio between dcf– and phen is 1:1. The signals
for the phen protons Ha, Hb, and
Hd are practically unchanged, while there is a small downfield
shift of 0.04–0.05 ppm of the Hc proton (located
at para position to the coordinated phen N-atom) in all
three complexes compared to that of free phen (Figure S3, Table S1) and consistent with metal coordination, supported by MS studies
(below). The resonance for the N–H proton of dcf– becomes either deshielded (in the case of 1 and 2) or shielded (in the case of 3), indicating some binding of the anion to the metal ion in solution.

The 13C NMR of complexes remain unchanged in complexes 1 and 3 compared to that of free ligands; however,
there is an upfield shift of δ = 0.9 ppm in the carboxylate
carbon of dcf–, which indicates that dcf– might be coordinated with K+ in the solution (Figure S4). Another
useful analysis is the 2D NMR experiment where through-space coupling
could provide important structural information in solution. However,
the 2D spectra did not show any coupling (Figures S5–S7) for complexes 1–3, indicating that either dissociation of the ligands from the alkali
metal ions or the coordination environment at the alkali metal precludes
the close approach between phen and dfc– ligands necessary to observe through-space interactions.

ESI–MS
ESI–MS studies were conducted
on all three complexes in MeOH (Figures S8–S10) and all reveal ions corresponding to phen H+, [M(phen)]+, and/or [M(phen)2]+, clearly indicating that the phen remains bound to the alkali metal in solution. While the 1H NMR data clearly point to some ion pairing between the alkali metal
and the dcf– anion, there is scant
evidence for this in the ESI–MS positive ion spectrum, the
exception being a low-intensity peak in the positive ion ESI–MS
spectrum of 1 corresponding to [Na(dcf)
+ H]+, suggesting predominant cleavage of the cation–anion
bond in the MS studies.

Cumulatively, the UV–vis and
MS data reflect coordination of the phen ligand to the
alkali metal ions in solution, while the 1H NMR data indicate
some sensitivity of the N–H proton to the alkali metal reflecting
some form of cation–anion pairing in solution.

Crystal Structure Description
[Na2(phen)2(H2O)4][dcf]2 (1)
The molecular structure
of 1 is shown in Figure 2, and selected interatomic distances and angles are
listed in Table 2. The complex crystallizes in the triclinic space group
P-1 with half of the molecule in the asymmetric unit. The Na+ cations are charge-balanced by two dcf– anions to satisfy the overall charge balance on the complex. Each
Na+ cation is five-coordinated and adopts a distorted spherical
square-pyramidal geometry (vide infra), with the O1 water atom occupying
the axial position. The equatorial sites comprise two chelating phen N (Nphen) atoms (N1 and N2) and two water
O atoms [(O2 and symmetry-related O1i) symmetry code: −x + 1, −y +1, −z + 1]. The Na–Nphen distances [2.491 (2) and 2.433
(2) Å] are consistent with related pentacoordinated Na complexes.38phen ligand molecules in 1 are planar and have similar bond distances and angles compared
to those found in the structure of free phen.39 The two crystallographically identical Na+ are connected to each other via two bridging water ligands
[Na1–O1 = 2.411 (2) Å and Na1–O1–Na1i =
83.50 (7)°], leading to a Na···Na separation of
3.208 (2) Å. The calculation of the degree of distortion of the
[NaN2O3] coordination polyhedron with respect
to an idealized five-coordinate polyhedron by the continuous shape
measure (CshM) theory utilizing SHAPE software28 (vide supra) indicated that the arrangement is closest
to the spherical square pyramidal (SPY-5), with a deviation from the
ideal C4v symmetry of
2.834 (Figure S11 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Sodium complexes containing both phen and dcf are unknown (CSD 2018). A similar complex with
formula [Na2(2-benzoylbenzoato)4 (phen)2(H2O)2]·H2O is reported,40 in which the coordination geometry around Na+ is quite similar to that found in 1; however, 2-benzoylbenzoate is coordinated with Na+, while in 1, the dcf– remains uncoordinated (vide supra).

[K2(phen)2(dcf)2(H2O)4] (2)
The molecular structure
of 2 is shown in Figure 3, and selected interatomic distances and angles are
listed in Table 3.
The complex crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1, with one phen, a dcf–, a K+ cation, and two coordinated water molecules in the asymmetric unit.
The K+ cations are charge-balanced by two dcf– anions, which satisfy the overall charge on complex 2. Each K+ adopts a distorted seven-coordinated
geometry comprising a [N2O5] donor set. The phen ligand adopts a N,N′-chelate mode through the N1 and N2 atoms, making a five-membered
ring, with K–N distances of 2.767 (2) and 2.782 (2) Å.
Like in complex 1, the K+ lies planar to the phen mean planes. The K–N bond lengths lie within the
normal observed range of 2.748(4)–2.872 (2) Å for related
potassium complexes with phen ligands.41dcf– coordinates with K+ using both of its carboxylate oxygen atoms (O2 and O3) with
K–O bond lengths of 2.949 (3) and 3.187 (2) Å. The K1—
Owater (O1, O4) distances are 2.742 (3) and 3.100 (4) Å,
respectively, while K1–O1/O1i–K1i angles are = 87.63
(9)°, leading to K···Ki [symmetry code
(i) = −x + 1, −y +
1, −z + 1] separation of 4.053 (1) Å.
Potassium complexes of phen with carboxylate as coligands
are not common. A CSD search (2018) resulted in only one hit,42 in which the K+ cation appeared to
be eight coordinate and K–Ocarboxylate distances
[2.351 (3)–2.488 (2) Å] are quite lower than those observed
in 2. In addition, the K+ is bridged by carboxylate
oxygen compared to complex 2 where K+ cations
are bridged by water molecules (vide infra). The calculation of the
degree of distortion of the [KN2O5] coordination
polyhedron with respect to an idealized five-coordinated polyhedron
by the CshM theory (vide supra) indicated that the arrangement appeared
to be close to the capped trigonal prism(CTPR-7) with a deviation
from the ideal symmetry of 10.00 (Figure S12 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information).

[Li(phen)(H2O)2][dcf] (3)
The molecular structure of 3 is shown in Figure 4, and selected interatomic
distances and angles are listed in Table 4. The complex crystallizes in the triclinic
space group P-1, with one phen ligand, a Li+ cation, two coordinated water molecules, and a dcf– anion in the asymmetric unit. The Li+ cation
is charge-balanced by an uncoordinated dcf– anion to satisfy the overall charge balance on the complex. The phen ligand molecules are virtually planar, and the values
of the bond distances and angles are comparable to those found in
the structure of free phen.39 The Li+ ion adopts a four-coordinated geometry comprising
a [N2O2] donor set. The bond angles around Li+ are in the range 81.2 (2)–130.6 (3)°. The phen ligand adopts a N,N′-chelate mode through the N1 and N2 atoms, making a five-membered
ring, with Li–N distances of 2.044 (7) and 2.107 (6) Å.
The Li–N bond lengths lie within the normal observed range
of 2.04–2.29 Å for related lithium complexes with phen ligands.18 The Li–Owater distances are 1.921 (5) and 1.936 (7) Å, consistent
with hydrated Li+ complexes reported by others.18 The degree of distortion of the [LiN2O2] coordination polyhedron with respect to an ideal four-coordinated
polyhedron was calculated by the CshM theory, which indicated that
the arrangement is closest to tetrahedron (T-4), with a deviation
from the ideal Td symmetry
of 3.75 (Figure S13 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information). Lithium complexes containing both phen and dcf are unknown. A CSD search (2018) on lithium
complexes with phen and carboxylates resulted in two
hits;27,43 in both cases, unlike complex 3, the carboxylate oxygens are coordinated with Li+ cations.

Bioactivity of Complexes 1–3
For complexes 1 and 3, the dcf– anion is hydrogen-bonded to the cation,
whereas for complex 2, the dcf– anion directly bonds to the K+ cation in the solid state.
In polar solvents and those capable of being involved in hydrogen
bonding, the species present in solution may well be charge-separated.
The solution studies reveal a strong affinity for the phen ligand to remain bound to the alkali metal, and 1H NMR
shows some sensitivity of the dcf- N–H
chemical shift to the metal ion as well. The dominant peaks in the
ESI–MS point to the lower molecular weight species present
in solution, suggesting that the dimeric motifs evident for both 1 and 2 in the solid state may break down in
the presence of donor solvents, with active species being [M(phen)(H2O)n]+ and/or [M(phen)(dcf)(H2O)n]. The complexes’ stability was checked
in solution periodically by 1H NMR in DMSO-d6 solvent and always gave the same data.

Anticancer Activity of Metal Complexes
Complexes 1–3 were evaluated for anticancer potential
against oral (CAL-27) and lung (NCI-H460) cancer cell lines as well
as for cytotoxic activities against normal mouse fibroblast (NIH-3T3).
As a result, all complexes displayed significant anticancer activities
against both cancer cell lines but less cytotoxicity against normal
cell lines (Table 5). Complex 1 showed most potent anticancer activity
toward lung and oral cancer cells with IC50 of 1.69 ±
0.02 and 3.87 ± 0.04, respectively, even better than the standard
5-fluorouracil (Table 5). The other two metal complexes (2 and 3) also showed significant anticancer activity against lung and oral
cancer cells but less toxicity toward normal cells. Complexes 2 and 3 showed comparable activity with standard
5-fluorouracil (Table 5). The cytotoxic activity of complexes was further confirmed by phase
contrast microscopy, which revealed apoptotic cells with a round and
irregular morphology after 48 h (Figures S14–S17).

Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Activity of Metal Compounds
Complexes 1–3 showed antivirulence
properties against Gram-negative strains (Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii) as compared
to Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus). dcf–K+ showed
no activity, while all complexes showed biofilm inhibitory activities
(Table 6). Furthermore,
these complexes have potential to inhibit virulence ability of microorganisms
as well as inhibit cancer cells and are likely candidates for the
development of new drug formulations but will require more detailed
studies to understand their mechanism of action.

Conclusions
We have successfully prepared three new
sodium, potassium, and lithium complexes containing both 1,10-phenanthroline
and diclofenac. In all three complexes, phen coordinates
as a bidentate ligand, while the dcf– ligand either remains uncoordinated (in the case of 1 and 3) or coordinates in a bidentate fashion (in the
case of 2). All complexes showed significant cytotoxic
activity against lung (NCI-H460) and oral cancer cell lines (CAL-27)
when compared to the normal mouse fibroblast (NIH-3T3). The cytotoxic
activity of the complexes was further confirmed by phase contrast
microscopy. The complexes showed significant antibacterial and antibiofilm
activity against Gram-negative strains (K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and A. baumannii).

Experimental Section
General Considerations
Solvents, ligands, and metal
salts were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further
purification.

Physical Measurements
Melting points were determined
using a Stanford Research Systems MPA120 EZ-Melt automated melting
point apparatus. Elemental compositions were determined on a PerkinElmer
2400 Series II CHNS/O Analyzer. UV–vis spectra were measured
on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer using 10–5 to
10–6 M solutions in water in the range 200–400
nm. IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha FT-IR spectrometer
equipped with a platinum single reflection diamond ATR module. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker
600 MHz in DMSO-d6. ESI–MS spectra
were recorded on Agilent Technologies, 6530 Accurate Mass.

X-ray Crystallography
Crystal data are summarized in Table 1. Single crystals
of 1, 2, and 3 were mounted
on a MiTeGen loop with grease and examined on a Bruker D8 VENTURE
APEX diffractometer equipped with a photon 100 CCD area detector at
296 (2) K using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å). Data were collected using the APEX-II software,29 integrated using SAINT30 and corrected for absorption using a multiscan approach (SADABS).31 Final cell constants were determined from full
least squares refinement of all observed reflections. The structure
was solved using intrinsic phasing (SHELXT).32 All non-H atoms were located in subsequent difference maps and refined
anisotropically with SHELXL-2014/7.33 H-atoms
on carbons were added at calculated positions and refined with a riding
model. O–H atoms were located in the difference map and refined
isotropically with U(iso) riding on O with DFIX constraints applied.
The structures of 1–3 have been deposited
with the CCDC (CCDC deposition numbers 1945208–1945210).

Cell Culture
Cell lines NCI-H460 (lung cancer), CAL-27
(oral cancer), and NIH-3t3 (mouse normal fibroblast) were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in our institute
biobank facility (PCMD, ICCBS, University of Karachi). The cells were
grown and passaged in high-glucose Dulbeccos’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 3.7 g of sodium bicarbonate,
2 mM l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% antibiotic
solution. The cells were regularly passaged until reaching 70% confluency.

Cell Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxic capabilities
of complexes 1–3 were evaluated by
the 3-(4′,5′-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay as described previously.34 Briefly, cells (10 000/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate
and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were washed,
and monolayer was treated with different concentrations of metallic
complexes and incubated further for 48 h. After incubation, 10 μL
of MTT dye (0.5 mg/mL) was added in each well and incubated for 4
h. The MTT dye was removed carefully after incubation, and insoluble
formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. Optical density was read
at 570 nm, and percent inhibition of cells was calculated. Ez-Fit
Enzyme Kinetics software (Perrella Scientific Inc., Amherst, NH, USA)
was used to calculate the IC50 value of compounds against
cancer and normal cell lines.

Phase Contrast Microscopy
Phase contrast microscopy
was performed to observe the morphological changes in cells after
treatment with complexes 1–3. Cells
(0.2 million/well) were seeded in a six-well plate and incubated for
24 h to form monolayers. Next day, the monolayer was washed and treated
with IC50 and IC70 doses of compounds. The wells
were photographed at 0, 24, and 48 h of treatment under a phase contrast
microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) using 10× magnification.

Antimicrobial and Biofilm Inhibitory Concentrations
For antimicrobial and biofilm inhibition assays, S.
aureus (NCTC 6571), K. pneumoniae (ATCC 13882), A. baumannii (ATCC
19606), and E. coli (ATCC 25922) were
used. Microorganisms were grown and maintained by using tryptone soya
broth and agar plate (Oxoid, UK). Antimicrobial activity and biofilm
inhibition were determined according to CLSI standards and as described
before.35 Briefly, complexes 1–3 were twofold serially diluted (500–1
μM) in TSB using a 96-well plate. The above-mentioned bacteria
were inoculated at 5 x 105 CFU/mL in each well except the
negative control. After inoculation, the plate was incubated for 24
h at 37 °C. Next day, a clear visible well with the lowest concentration
of the compound was considered as minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC).

For the evaluation of biofilm inhibition capability of
complexes, a crystal violet biofilm assay was used. Plates were prepared
similarly as mentioned in the MIC determination. After overnight incubation,
the used media were discarded, and the plate was washed with sterilized
distilled water to remove unbound cells. Crystal violet (200 μL;
0.1% w/v) was used to stain biofilms for 15 min after compound treatment.
The stain was removed, and the plate was washed to remove excess stain
and plates were air-dried. Bound dye was solubilized by using 30%
(v/v) glacial acetic acid, and the absorbance was recorded at 590
nm. Biofilm percent inhibition was evaluated by using the formula
