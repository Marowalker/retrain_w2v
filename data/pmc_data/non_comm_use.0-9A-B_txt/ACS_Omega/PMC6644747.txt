Various types of acridine were conjugated
to DNA and used for site-selective
RNA scission together with another unmodified DNA and a Lu(III) ion.
The target phosphodiester linkage in the substrate RNA was selectively
and efficiently activated, and was hydrolyzed by the free Lu(III)
ion. Among the investigated 14 conjugates, the conjugate bearing 9-amino-2-isopropoxy-6-nitroacridine
was the best RNA-activator. Systematic evaluation of the RNA-activating
ability of the acridines showed that (1) the acridines act as an acid
catalyst within the RNA activation, (2) the amino-group at the 9-position
of acridine is essential to modulate the acidity of acridine, (3)
the electron-withdrawing group at the 3-position further enhances
the acid catalysis, and (4) the substituent at the 2-position sterically
modulates the orientation of acridine-intercalation favorably for
the catalysis. Moreover, it is revealed that the opposite base of
acridine does not inhibit direct interaction of acridine with the
target phosphodiester linkage.

==== Body
Introduction
To date, various conjugates
of oligonucleotides with intercalating
agents have been prepared, mainly because of their attractive potential
for biological applications (e.g., antisense technology and antigene
technology).1 Acridine is one of the most
studied intercalating agents.2

Recently,
we found a unique function of the DNA conjugates, which
bear a popular acridine derivative, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine
(AMCA), in RNA scission.3 When these conjugates
form a heteroduplex with RNA, phosphodiester linkages on either side
of the nucleoside opposite the acridine are efficiently activated,
and thus are selectively hydrolyzed by lanthanide(III) ions or various
divalent ions (e.g., Zn(II) and Mn(II)), which catalyze RNA hydrolysis.
These metal ions are never covalently bound anywhere, and freely move
around in the solutions, which is unlike common strategies for construction
of artificial ribonucleases, in which the catalyst for RNA scission
is conjugated to oligonucleotides as a sequence-recognizing moiety.4−6 The selective-scission site is strictly limited to the opposite
phosphodiester linkage of the acridine. This most significant advantage
of the system enabled us to clip out desired short RNA fragments from
predetermined positions in long RNA by using a bis-acridine–DNA
conjugate, and to develop a precise single nucleotide polymorphism
genotyping method.7

Previous studies
on site-selective RNA scission by Lu(III) with
a few variations of acridine–DNA conjugates have shown that
the key for RNA scission is the RNA activation induced by the intercalation.3b Intercalation-induced conformational changes
in the RNA backbone have been proposed as a factor that facilitates
intramolecular attack of 2′-O to the scissile phosphorous atom.
Moreover, comparison of the activity of the conjugates bearing 9-aminoacridine,
9-amino-2-methoxyacridine, 9-amino-3-chloroacridine, AMCA, and 9-amino-2-methoxy-6-nitroacridine
suggested that acridines act as an acid catalyst in the reaction,
because more acidic acridine shows higher activity. Both of these
factors are supposed to participate in the RNA activation, although
the details have not been sufficiently clarified. For example, the
acridines employed in previous studies vary in the kind, number, and
position of the substituents, which may affect not only the acidity
of the acridine but also the orientation of the intercalation, as
well as the resulting conformational changes of the complex. In this
study, we synthesized 14 acridine–DNA conjugates by systematically
varying the substituents on the acridines to understand the mechanism
of RNA activation more precisely. The DNA in these conjugates is complementary
with the 5′-side portion of the substrate RNA, and has different
acridine moieties at the 5′-ends (2a–n in Figure 1, combinations of the substituents on acridine are presented in Table 1). For site-selective
RNA scission, they were combined with another unmodified DNA 3, which is complementary with the remaining portion of the
RNA, and a Lu(III) ion as the cocatalyst for RNA hydrolysis.

Results and Discussion
Site-Selective
RNA Scission by Lu(III) in the Presence of Acridine–DNA
Conjugates and Determination of Their pKa Values
RNA cleavage assay of 36-mer substrate RNA 1a was performed by combining acridine–DNA conjugates 2 with another unmodified DNA 3 in the presence
of Lu(III) as cocatalyst. All of the 14 acridine–DNA conjugates
except for 2g and 2n efficiently and site-selectively
activated RNA (Figure 2). Previous studies have suggested that acid catalysis by protonated
acridines takes place in the site-selective RNA activation. If this
is the case, activity of the acridines is proportional to the fraction
of protonated acridines under the reaction conditions (pH 8.0). The
pKa values of the acridines estimated
from the pH dependence of absorption spectra (Figure S1) and the rate constants for the site-selective scission
by Lu(III) are presented in Table 1. The pKa values for the
acridines with 9-amino-group (2a–m) are all within ca. 9–12, which is significantly higher than
those reported for free acridines (ca. 7–10),8 probably because of the polyanionic nature of the conjugated
DNA portion. Observed first-order-rate constants (kobs) were corrected by the fraction of protonated acridines
calculated from the pKa values (kcat). Figure 3 shows the dependence of the efficiency of the site-selective
scission by Lu(III) on the acidity of the acridines.

Lu(III) on the acidity of the acridines. Filled squares, disubstituted
acridines with a methoxy-group at the 2-positions; open squares, disubstituted
acridines with a nitro-group at the 6-positions and a bulky ether
at the 2-positions; filled diamond, disubstituted acridine with a
methyl-group at the 2-position; open circle, the acridine without
substituent; open triangles, monosubstituted acridines at the 2-positions;
filled circles, monosubstituted acridines at the 3-positions. The
slope of the solid fitted line for (2f, 2j, and 2m) is −0.29, whereas that for the dotted
line for (2a, 2e, and 2i) is
−0.21.

Acidity Effect of the Acridines
Plots of the activity
of 2f, 2j, and 2m in Figure 3 (filled squares)
show clear linearity of the RNA-activating ability with the acidity
of the acridine (α ≈ 0.3). This result is in fair accordance
with previously proposed acid catalysis in the reaction. The conjugates 2f, 2j, and 2m possess a methoxy-group
on the 2-position (R2 in Figure 1), and another substituent (chloro-, nitro-,
and methyl-groups, respectively) on the 6-position (R1).
Among them, 2j shows the highest RNA-activating ability
(kcat = 0.082 h–1),
and is 3 times as active as 2f (kcat = 0.027 h–1). This high activity is due to the relatively high acidity of 9-amino-2-methoxy-6-nitroacridine
(pKa = 8.8) compared to that of AMCA (10.7).3c When the electron-withdrawing nitro-group in 2j is replaced with the electron-donating methyl-group (2m), the acidity of the acridine becomes much lower than that
of AMCA (pKa of 9-amino-2-methoxy-6-methylacridine
is 11.9 in the conjugate, Table 1). Accordingly, the activity of 2m significantly
decreases compared to that of 2f. The RNA-activating
activity of the conjugate 2h (filled diamond in Figure 3), on the other hand,
in which the methoxy-group of 2f is replaced by a methyl-group,
clearly deviates from the series of 2f, 2j, and 2m into the negative direction. The methoxy-group
at the 2-position plays a particular positive role in the reaction.

The conjugates bearing mono- or unsubstituted acridines are also
available for RNA activation. The acridines in 2b, 2c, and 2d possess methoxy-, chloro-, and nitro-groups
at the 2-positions (R2), respectively, whereas those in 2e and 2i have chloro- and nitro-groups at the
3-positions (R1). All of them are less active than 2f, which bears AMCA with chloro- and methoxy-groups on the
ring. The activity of the conjugates is in the following order: 2f ≫ 2i ≫ 2d > 2e > 2a, 2b > 2c. When
substituents are introduced to the same position in acridine, more
acidic acridine shows more efficient RNA activation (e.g., 2d > 2c or 2i > 2e), further
confirming the existence of acid catalysis. The line connecting the
plots for 2e, 2i, and 2a (α
≈ 0.2) is not very different from the fitted line to the series
of 2f, 2j, and 2m.

Steric Effect
of the Substituents
The conjugates bearing
substituents at the 3-position (2e and 2i, filled circles in Figure 3) are slightly more active than the corresponding conjugates
bearing the substituent at the 2-position (2c and 2d, open triangles), although the acidity of acridines is
almost the same for each. The position of the substituents in acridine
significantly influences RNA-activating ability. The conjugate 2b can be considered as an element of the series of 2f, 2k, and 2m, because it also
has a methoxy-group at the 2-position (the 6-position is unsubstituted).
However, the activity of this conjugate is far lower than that of
the other conjugates in the series, although this conjugate shows
rather high RNA-activating ability for the 2-monosubstituted conjugate
(compare 2b/2c/2d series with 2a/2e/2i in Figure 3). These facts indicate that the positive
effect of the 2-methoxy-group on RNA activation requires a bulkier
substituent than a proton at the 6-position.

The conjugates 2k and 2l are derivatives of 2j,
which shows the highest RNA-activating ability among the acridines
bearing a 2-methoxy-group and another substituent. These conjugates
bear a nitro-group at the 3-position and more bulky substituents than
the methoxy-group (ethoxy- for 2k and isopropoxy- for 2l) at the 2-position. As shown in Table 1, these conjugates induce quite rapid site-selective
RNA cleavage. The larger the substituent at the 2-position, the higher
the activity. The conjugate 2l with the largest substituent
is about 1.7 times as active as 2j, although the acidity
of the acridines is not much affected by the substitution. The plots
for these conjugates in Figure 3 positively deviated from the fitted line. A steric and positive
effect of the alkyl ether at the 2-position is evident. When acridines
intercalate, these bulky groups cannot enter the space between the
nucleobases, and assumedly modulate the orientation of the acridine.
Interaction between the lone pair of the oxygen and electron acceptors
in the nucleotides is another possibility.

This steric effect
is further confirmed by the cleavage reaction
using another conjugate, 2g. This conjugate has the second
methoxy-group at the 4-position (R3) in addition to the
two substituents of 2f (chlorine and methoxy-group),
and thus has three substituents on the acridine. This conjugate shows
almost no RNA activation, although its acidity (pKa = 10.9) is not much different to that of 2f. The third substituent placed at the flanking position of the ring-nitrogen
is probably disturbing appropriate alignment of the acridine as well
as the interaction between protonated ring-nitrogen and the scissile
phosphodiester linkage, which is essential for the proposed acid catalysis.

Thermodynamic and Electrostatic Properties
To evaluate
the strength of the interaction between the acridine and the substrate
RNA, Tm values of heteroduplexes of 1a with 2 were measured one by one (Table 1). All of the acridines
in the conjugates stabilize the duplex. The stabilizing effect of
the acridines with a 9-amino-group (2a–m) is similar for each (elevation of the Tm values from that of unmodified 2u ≈ 6 °C),
even for 2g, which showed almost no RNA-activation ability
in the Lu(III) system. This large duplex-stabilization is ascribed
to the positive charges on the acridines. Consistently, the stabilizing
effect of 2n, which exists mostly as a neutral species,
or of 2o without ring-nitrogen, is significantly lower
than those of the above conjugates. The similar stabilizing efficiency
of the acridines with the 9-amino-group suggests that all of these
acridines in the conjugates, including 2g, intercalate
into the ternary complex in a similar way, although another unmodified
DNA 3 was not employed in these Tm measurements. The large differences of RNA-activating ability
between the acridines are apparently independent of the strength of
the interaction between the acridine and the substrate.

One
possible factor that determines the manner of intercalation is the
dipole moment of the acridines. Those evaluated for the acridines
employed in this study are presented in Table 1. They are defined mainly by the substituents
on the acridine ring, and vary in magnitude and direction. The series
of three disubstituted conjugates bearing a 2-methoxy-group shows
quite different polarization. The order of the magnitude of polarization
is as follows: 2j (5.4 D) > 2m (1.8)
> 2f (0.8). This order does not match the order of
RNA-activating
ability. Moreover, the directions of the moment for these conjugates
are also different. For 2j, the moment points to the
electron-attracting nitro-group of the 9-amino-group (a in the inset of Figure 1). In contrast, the moment of 2m points to the
2-methoxy-group (b). The trend of RNA-activation
abilities may not be simply attributed to polarization of the acridines.

Conformational Factor in RNA Activation
RNA activated
by acridine–DNA conjugates can be selectively cleaved not only
with Lu(III) ion but also with Zn(II).3a The major scission site is the 5′-side of U19, as in the
reaction with Lu(III). Quite interestingly, a positive correlation
between the RNA-activating ability and the acidity of acridines completely
disappears in the scission by Zn(II) (Table 1). The activity of the scission is simply
related to the number and the position of the substituents on the
acridines. The conjugates bearing two substituents (e.g., 2f, 2j, and 2m) show almost the same activity
as each other, which is 2 times as high as that of the conjugates
bearing only one substituent (e.g., 2c, 2e, and 2i) or unsubstituted acridine (2a), except for 2h with chloro- and methyl- groups. The
activity of 2b for the reaction with Zn(II) is significantly
high for a conjugate bearing monosubstituted acridine compared to
that with Lu(III). Even 2g with three substituents, which
was totally inactive for the Lu(III)-catalyzed reaction yet intercalated
to the heteroduplex according to the thermodynamic study, induced
selective cleavage comparable to that with 2a or 2d. Presumably, the major origin of the RNA activation observed
in the scission by the Zn(II) ion is conformational changes of the
substrate, which is roughly determined by the steric factors of the
substituents, and the acid catalysis closely related to the electronic
effects of the substituents as well as more precise orientation of
the acridine ring does not participate in the reaction here. The quite
contrastive contribution of 2g suggests that the acid
catalysis in the Lu(III) system is the essential factor, whereas the
conformational changes are supplementary.

Effect of Opposite Nucleobase
on Site-Selective RNA Activation
For sufficient RNA activation,
according to the previous study,
the acridine should be introduced in DNA as a substitution, not an
insertion, for the opposite nucleotide to the target one.3a A modified RNA substrate 1b involves
an abasic analogue in place of U19 in 1a (Figure 4), and was used for the reaction
to evaluate how the opposite base affects RNA activation. As shown
in Figure 5, 1b is also site-selectively activated by the acridine–DNA
conjugate, and efficiently cleaved by Lu(III). Site-selective scission
with the use of a conjugate bearing 9-amino-2-methoxy-6-nitroacridine
(4b, lane 2) proceeds more rapidly than that with AMCA
(4a, lane 1). Scission at the 3′-side of the abasic
analogue does not occur because of the lack of 2′-OH in the
abasic analogue. The ratio of the activity of 4b (the
conversion is 29%) to 4a (15%) is not much different
from that in the scission of native substrate 1a. Therefore,
acid catalysis by the acridine takes place almost irrespective of
the existence of the opposite base.

Figure 4 Structures of the oligonucleotides used
in the study of the effect
of the opposite base. The target scission site (the 5′-phosphodiester
linkage of the abasic analogue) is indicated by the arrow.

M, Lu(III) without any additional DNA.

When the substrate is as abasic as 1b, intercalated
acridine can directly interact with the target phosphodiester linkage
for acid catalysis without interference by the opposite base. For
the scission of native RNA, on the other hand, there are two possible
states that the opposite base may take to allow interaction of the
acridine with the scissile linkage: to loop-out or to stack-in.9 The fluorescent nucleotide analogue 2-aminopurine
(AP) is a useful probe to study stacking interactions of bases in
duplexes.10 Its fluorescence is significantly
sensitive to its environment, and exhibits strong quenching when it
is stacked in duplexes. Accordingly, AP-modified 9-mer RNA 5 (Figure 4) was prepared
to examine whether the opposite base of the acridine loops out of
the heteroduplex or stacks in it. When completely complementary DNA 6 is hybridized to 5, 82% of the fluorescence
of AP is quenched compared to that of the single-stranded 5 (Figure 6). In 6/5, AP can form a base pair with the opposite
dT and stacks in the heteroduplex. In another native DNA 7, on the other hand, dA is incorporated into the opposite site of
AP to make a purine–purine mismatch. Previous NMR studies on
an oligodeoxynucleotide containing AP opposite dA have shown that
AP is somewhat pushed out of the helix.11 The quenching is far smaller (30%), in fact, in the heteroduplex
of 7/5 compared to that of 6/5. Between the two contrastive heteroduplexes of 7/5 and 6/5, heteroduplexes
involving acridine–DNA conjugates (8a/5 and 8b/5) behave rather similarly to completely
complementary 6/5. Upon hybridization, about
71% of the fluorescence of AP is quenched in both heteroduplexes.
The acridines in 8a and 8b have quite different
optical characteristics. The absorbance spectrum of the acridine in 8a has two maxima at 428 and 450 nm, and the acridine is strongly
fluorescent (emission maximum at 496 nm). The acridine in 8b, on the other hand, has only one absorbance maximum at 476 nm, and
is not fluorescent. The similar fluorescent behavior of AP between 8a/5 and 8b/5 thus
suggests that quenching of AP can be ascribed simply to the steric
feature of the acridines. These results indicate that, at least for
the sequence employed in this study (AP between C and G), intercalated
acridine does not push the opposite base out of the helix, probably
getting into the space beneath it.

Figure 6 Fluorescence of 2-aminopurine in various
heteroduplexes. The fluorescence
intensities at 370 nm (exited at 303 nm) were normalized by that of
single-stranded 5.

Previous thermodynamic12 or NMR13 studies on single-base bulges in DNA/DNA duplexes
have shown that whether the bulged base flips out or not depends on
the kind of bulged and flanking bases. It should be noted that the
possibility of base flipping in another sequence than that employed
in the present study cannot be completely ruled out, because the scission
efficiency slightly depends on the target sequence (see Table S1), although the present site-selective
RNA scission system can cleave basically any target sequences.

Conclusions
Between the 14 acridine–DNA conjugates investigated in this
study, the conjugate bearing 9-amino-2-isopropoxy-6-nitroacridine
showed the most efficient RNA-activating ability. Acid catalysis by
acridine in site-selective RNA activation is proved by the existence
of clear linearity between the rate constants and the acidity of the
acridines. The conjugates bearing acridines with two substituents,
2-alkoxy and another one on the 6-position, show significantly high
activity, probably due to favorable orientation of intercalation (as
well as resulting conformational changes in the RNA backbone), which
is sterically regulated by the 2-alkoxy-group. Contribution of the
difference in acridine-polarization or stacking interaction to the
difference in activity is improbable, because little relationship
was observed between these factors. The acid catalysis takes place
almost irrespective of the existence of the opposite base, which stacks
in the helix within the heteroduplex of the RNA/acridine–DNA
conjugate. The present study sheds light on the mechanism of site-selective
RNA activation by acridine–DNA conjugates, and paves the way
for future designing of useful tools in biochemistry and biotechnology.

Experimental
Procedures
Preparation of Oligonucleotides
All of the oligonucleotides
were synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA synthesizer in 1 μmol scale.
An extended coupling time of 10 min was adopted for the coupling of
monomers bearing acridines. Unmodified DNA 2u and 3 were synthesized with standard monomers. Acridine–DNA
conjugates 2a, 2c, and 2f were
synthesized by reacting 9-phenoxy acridine derivatives with 5′-amino-modified
oligonucleotide on CPG.3b Other conjugates
were prepared by synthesizing phosphoramidite monomers bearing acridines
as described in previous papers.3b−3e Cleavage from support and deprotection
of acridine–DNA conjugates were carried out with 0.4 M methanolic
NaOH (4:1 MeOH/H2O) at room temperature for 16 h, whereas
native oligonucleotides were treated with conc. aqueous ammonium hydroxide.
Crude products were purified by Poly-PaK II cartridges (Glen Research
Co.), and then by a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) equipped with an RP-C18 column (Cica-Merck LiChroCART 125-4;
a linear gradient of 5–25% acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium formate
over 20 min; flow rate 0.5 mL/min). They were fully characterized
by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry using 3-hydroxypicolinic acid
as a matrix. Their base compositions were further confirmed by HPLC
analyses of the digests with snake venom phoshodiesterase and alkaline
phosphatase.

RNA Scission Assay
The substrate
RNA 1 (5′-end fluorescein amidite-labeled, 4 or
5 μM), modified
or unmodified DNA 2 (10 μM), and another unmodified
DNA 3 (10 μM) were dissolved in pH 8 Tris–HCl
buffer (10 mM) containing 200 mM NaCl. The mixture was heated to 90
°C (for 1 min), and slowly cooled to room temperature. Then,
1/10 volume of aqueous solution of LuCl3 was added to the
mixture (the final concentration of Lu(III) was 100 μM). After
3 h at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched by 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid-2Na solution and analyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (Figures 2 and 5). Imaging and quantification
of RNA cleavage were carried out on a Fuji Film FLA-3000G fluorescent
imaging analyzer. Pseudo-first-order rate constants were calculated
by monitoring the reaction up to 6 h. For the cleavage by Zn(II),
1 mM Zn(NO3)2 was used, and the reactions were
monitored up to 12 h.

Measurement of pKa Values of the
Acridines in the DNA Conjugate
The pKa values of the acridine residues in the conjugates were directly
evaluated by using their absorbances. The pH value of the specimens
containing 2 (10 μM) and NaCl (200 mM) was adjusted
stepwise in the range of pH 4.0–12.0. The absorption spectra
for each pH were obtained on a JASCO V-530 spectrometer in a quartz
cell of 1 cm path length. Curve fitting by the theoretical equation
for the absorbance at the following wavelengths gave each pKa: 2a, 438 nm; 2b,
450 nm; 2c, 446 nm; 2d, 424 nm; 2e, 436 nm; 2f, 451 nm;3c2g, 459 nm; 2h, 442 nm; 2i, 468
nm; 2j, 476 nm;3c2k, 479 nm;3e2l, 479 nm;3e2m, 446 nm (see Figure S1).

Calculation of Dipole Moments
All
calculations were
made using the Spartan ’02 package (Wavefunction, Inc.) using
the HF/6-31G* basic set.

Measurement of Melting Temperature (Tm)
The melting profiles of the duplexes
were obtained on
a JASCO V-530 spectrometer at 260 nm in a quartz cell of 1 cm path
length. The specimens contained 2 (1 μM), the substrate
RNA 1a (1 μM), and NaCl (200 mM) in pH 8 Tris–HCl
buffer (10 mM). The heating rate was 1.0 °C/min.

Measurement
of the Fluorescence of 2-Aminopurine (AP)
AP-modified RNA
(4 μM) and complementary DNA (5 μM) were
dissolved in a solution of 200 mM NaCl and 10 mM Tris–HCl at
pH 8.0. Fluorescence spectra were obtained at 5 °C on a JASCO
FP-6500 spectrometer in a micro quartz cell (the base size 3 mm ×
3 mm) with an excitation wavelength of 303 nm. Fluorescence intensity
at 370 nm was normalized by that at 50 °C (single-stranded).
