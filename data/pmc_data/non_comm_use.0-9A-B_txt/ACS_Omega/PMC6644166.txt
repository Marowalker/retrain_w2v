Polymer–inorganic
semiconducting composite (MCTP–Fe3O4)
particles were fabricated by loading nanosized
Fe3O4 on the microporous covalent triazine-based
polymer (MCTP) through a chemical coprecipitation method and then
applied to an electrorheological (ER) material. The structural and
morphological images of MCTP–Fe3O4 composite
were examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Their magnetic property was also
investigated by vibrating sample magnetometry. The chain structure
formation of MCTP–Fe3O4 dispersed in
silicone oil under an external electric field was confirmed using
an optical microscope. The ER fluid based on MCTP–Fe3O4 was processed by dispersing the composite particles
in an oil medium, and for comparison, an ER fluid based on pure MCTP
was also prepared by the same process. The ER performance of two different
ER fluids was scrutinized by a rotational rheometer, which demonstrated
that MCTP–Fe3O4 showed better ER characteristics
than MCTP-based ER suspension.

Introduction
Electrorheological (ER) fluids are constituted
by suspending electrically
polarizable/semiconducting particles in a liquid medium with a relatively
low permittivity, and the phase change between fluid-like and solid-like
states of ER fluids is tunable by the application and revocation of
an electric field.1−4 When there is no electric field, the ER suspensions demonstrate
a fluid-like phase, where the particles are freely dispersed in a
liquid medium. Under an external electric field, the originally suspended
particles aggregate together to organize into columnar-like structures
in the medium, which stiffens the structure of ER suspensions, thus
presenting solid-like properties. After the electric field is removed,
the ER fluids can be restored to their original fluid-like state.
This tunable phase transition makes ER fluids to have great potential
for applications in various engineering fields.5,6

As for actively electroresponsive ER materials, conjugated semiconducting
polymers have been widely researched as ER materials and have shown
worthy ER properties, which were generally derived from their advantages
of controllable electric conductivity, low density, and fine dispersion
stability.7−10 Furthermore, composites based on conjugated semiconductive polymers
have also been introduced as ER materials.11−14 Especially, polymer–inorganic
composites can not only improve the disadvantages of high density
and low interfacial polarization of inorganic particles but also demonstrate
the synergistic effect of inorganic–organic components.

Very recently, the ER behaviors of semiconducting microporous covalent
triazine-based polymer (MCTP)-based ER fluid have been reported, showing
that the MCTP could be a potential ER material with its proper particle
size, low density, and suitable electrical conductivity.15 Concurrently, magnetic Fe3O4 particles have also been widely applied in many areas because of
their high saturation magnetization (Ms), biological compatibility, low cost, and easy synthesis process.16−18 In addition, their unusual electrochemical properties induced by
the transfer of electrons between Fe2+ and Fe3+ cause electrical conductivity of the Fe3O4, drawing interest from their effect on the synergistic ER performance
along with their magnetorheological (MR) characteristics.19 However, as with most inorganic materials, its
high density and unsuitable particle size on the nanoscale may limit
its application in ER fluids.

Therefore, in this study, we fabricated
polymer–inorganic
(MCTP–Fe3O4) composite particles by synthesizing
nanosized Fe3O4 particles on the MCTP microspheres
via a chemical coprecipitation method. ER properties of MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER fluid were then investigated and compared
with those of MCTP-based ER suspension, finding that the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension showed better ER properties
than MCTP alone, judging by the shear stress curves, shear viscosity
curves, and ER efficiency.

Results and Discussion
Morphological
and structural characteristics of MCTP–Fe3O4 were observed by both SEM and TEM measurements.
The SEM image (Figure 1a) showed that the nanosized Fe3O4 particles
were generated on the surface of the MCTP microsphere, whereas the
TEM image (Figure 1b) revealed that the shape and size of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were spherical and about 10 nm, respectively. However,
the uneven distribution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
makes the morphology and properties of MCTP–Fe3O4 heterogeneous, which is very likely to have an extra effect
on its ER characteristics.

Figure 1 (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of the MCTP–Fe3O4.

The structural formation of the MCTP–Fe3O4 was investigated by FTIR. Similar to the FTIR spectrum
of
MCTP (Figure 2b), MCTP–Fe3O4 (Figure 2a) also shows a series of peaks in the region between 1000
and 1700 cm–1, indicating the characteristic peaks
of the s-triazine-based groups,20,21 and the slight shift of some peaks results from the combination
with Fe3O4. Furthermore, there is a significant
new absorption peak at 586 cm–1 in the MCTP–Fe3O4, corresponding to the Fe—O bond in Fe3O4 (Figure 2c).22,23

MCTP, and (c) Fe3O4.

The MCTP–Fe3O4 particles were
also
examined using XRD, and results are shown in Figure 3c, in which the broad peak below and above
20° (2θ) corresponded to the stacking of aromatic sheets
in the amorphous MCTP (Figure 3a).24 The XRD spectrum of the MCTP–Fe3O4 also revealed relatively sharp peak points at
2θ angles of 30.2, 35.6, 43.1, 53.7, 57.4, and 62.9°, which
matched to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystalline
planes of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Figure 3b), respectively.25

MCTP–Fe3O4 composite particles
were
expected to be magnetic because of the presence of the Fe3O4 component in the composite.26,27 The magnetization curve (Figure 4) of MCTP–Fe3O4 showed
a superparamagnetic behavior, being consistent qualitatively with
that of pure Fe3O4 fabricated via a chemical
coprecipitation process with ferrous and ferric ions.28 The Ms of MCTP–Fe3O4 was 3.3 emu/g, and this very low value compared
with that of Fe3O4 might be ascribed to the
very low content of magnetite in the composite. Because of the extremely
low Ms value, even though the MCTP–Fe3O4 could be magnetized, it was not strong enough
to be used as an MR material.29,30

Figure 4 Magnetic properties of
MCTP–Fe3O4.

Before the rheological tests of the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension by a rotational rheometer, the
buildup
of the chain structure of the MCTP–Fe3O4 suspended in an oil medium (Figure 5b) after the application of an electric field (1.33
kV/mm) was virtually detected using optical microscopy (OM) compared
to that of the randomly dispersed state without an electric field
(Figure 5a). As shown,
without an electric field applied, the MCTP–Fe3O4 particles exhibited a freely dispersed state in the silicone
oil. However, when the electric field is applied, electrostatic interactions
between neighboring particles drive the originally randomly dispersed
particles to form chain-like structures along the direction of the
electric field, indicating the suspension turned into a solid-like
state.31,32

Figure 5 OM images of the MCTP–Fe3O4 suspended
in silicone oil (a) without and (b) with an electric field (1.33 kV/mm).

The ER properties of both MCTP
and MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspensions were
then measured using a rotational
rheometer with concentric-type cylinder geometry (CC17/E). The steady
shear flow tests were performed in controlled shear rate mode for
several electric field strengths for the shear rate covering from
0.1 to 1000 s–1. Figure 6 shows shear-rate-dependent shear stresses
(Figure 6a) and shear
viscosities (Figure 6b) for MCTP (lines)- and MCTP–Fe3O4 (symbols)-based
ER suspensions for different electric field strengths. As presented
in Figure 6a, without
an electric field strength applied, they exhibited Newtonian fluid
behaviors with similar shear stresses. However, they exhibited Bingham
fluid behaviors with a distinct increment of the shear stresses with
increased electric field strengths. In addition, the ER fluid based
on MCTP–Fe3O4 showed higher shear stress
values than those based on the MCTP under external electric field
strengths. However, compared to the MCTP, the shear stress curve of
the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER fluid showed
some fluctuations, which could also be found in many other studies.33−36 For the competition between hydrodynamic and electrostatic forces
in ER fluids in general, if the electrostatic forces prevail, the
chain structure destroyed by the hydrodynamic force can be reorganized
immediately, and the shear stress remains constant. Thus, the fluctuations
in the shear stress curves can be understood that the electrostatic
interaction force does not always prevail; in other words, the hydrodynamic
and electrostatic forces are alternately dominant. In addition, the
fluctuations could also come from various physical conditions of the
ER fluid and dispersed particles. As observed in the SEM and TEM images
from Figure 1, the
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were not uniformly distributed
on the surface of the MCTP, resulting in quite different morphologies
from typical ER materials. This fact would induce nonuniform electric
field responses for each part of the material. The fluctuation of
shear stress may be partly related to this heterogeneity of the ER
material. At the same time, without an electric field, the shear viscosities
presented an almost constant value in the entire shear rate regime,
indicating a Newtonian fluid state. With an external electric field,
they exhibited typical shear-thinning behaviors. The shear viscosities
of MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension were
also larger than those of MCTP-based ER suspension.

Figure 6 (a) Shear-rate-dependent
shear stresses and (b) shear viscosities
of MCTP–Fe3O4 (symbols)- and MCTP (lines)-based
ER suspensions for different electric field strengths.

To examine the ER effects of two ER suspensions
more intuitively,
we calculated the ER efficiency according to eq 1 1  where ηE and
η0 are the shear viscosity with and without an electric
field, respectively. As presented in Figure 7, we plotted shear-rate-dependent ER efficiency
for MCTP–Fe3O4 (symbol)- and MCTP (line)-based
ER suspensions, showing that MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER fluid possessed remarkably higher values than the MCTP-based
ER fluid. This benefit might originate from the fact that the electrical
conductivity of Fe3O4 may also be related to
changes in particle size, morphology, and surface roughness of the
composite particles, which could enhance its ER performance.37

Figure 7 Shear-rate-dependent ER efficiency for MCTP–Fe3O4 (symbols)- and MCTP (lines)-based ER suspensions
for
different electric field strengths.

Note that the Bingham model38 has
been
extensively employed to explain shear stresses of the ER suspensions
under electric field strengths applied, which can be expressed as
follows: 2   3  Here, τs is
the shear stress under an electric field, γ̇ is the shear
rate, and parameters τdy and η∞ represent dynamic yield stress and shear viscosity at an infinite
shear rate, respectively. The fitting results of the Bingham model
are shown as dotted lines in Figure 8. Generally, the Bingham model shows two regions. In
a low shear rate range, the shear stress shows a stable value with
a plateau behavior; at a high shear rate area, the shear stresses
increase with shear rate. However, under the electric fields in this
study, specifically at a high electric field strength region, the
shear stress values for MCTP–Fe3O4-based
ER suspension showed a trend of decline and then rise, in which the
Bingham model could not properly fit the experimental data. Therefore,
a more complex model named Cho–Choi–Jhon (CCJ) model39 with six parameters was developed as shown in eq 4: 4  Here, t1 and t2 are time parameters; η∞ is usually viewed
as the shear viscosity at an infinitely
high shear rate when there is no electric field; an index α
is responsible for the control of the decreased area of the shear
stress; β is for governing the increase of shear stress in a
high shear rate area.40 Fitting results
of the CCJ model are also shown as solid lines in Figure 8. It can be seen that the CCJ
model matched the experimental data better than the Bingham model.
Furthermore, Table 1 shows the fitted parameters of CCJ equation for MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension, where the coefficient of
determination R2 is a measure of goodness
of fit. The closer R2 is to 1.0, the better
the model fits the experimental data. As shown in this table, the R2 are very close to 1.0 when the electric field
strengths are 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kV/mm, which means that the CCJ model
can explain well the experimental data. However, at an electric field
strength of 2.0 kV/mm, the value of R2 is relatively lower. This may be because the high electric field
intensity is close to a critical value for the occurrence of electrical
breakdown, which leads to
a special change in the behavior of the ER suspension; therefore,
the CCJ model does not match it well. The fitting value of η∞ is independent of the electric field strength, similar
to the case of the Bingham fluid model for ER fluids.41 Even though it is defined to be the shear viscosity at
an infinite shear rate in the absence of an electric field, under
a limited maximum shear rate (103 s–1) of our experimental condition, it varied randomly for different
electric fields. This is because, even in the presence of an electric
field, when the shear rate is very high, the chain structure is considered
to be almost completely destroyed and the shear viscosity becomes
close to the viscosity without the electric field, similar to previously
reported studies.42,43

From its dynamic oscillation test, Figure 9 presents storage (G′)
and loss moduli (G″) as a function of strain.
Without an external electric field strength, G″
was larger than G′, indicating the fluid-like
state of the ER fluid. However, with an electric field, G′ became higher than G″, being increased
with an increased electric field strength. This means that the ER
suspension transformed to a solid-like state and the chain-like structure
caused by the electric field became more and more rigid as the electric
field strength increased. In addition, G′
showed stable values in a low strain range (i.e., linear viscoelastic
region γLVE), and it drastically declined when the
strain exceeded a certain value (critical strain γc), indicating that at this moment the breakdown of chain-like structures
began to occur.44 As shown in Figure 9, the critical strain
for MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension was
about 0.05%.

moduli

Elastic stresses were evaluated
on the basis of the relationship
of τe = G′ ×
γ, in which τe is the elastic stress and γ
is the strain. Figure 10 shows elastic stresses as a function of strain, where the red circles
marked the elastic yield stresses, which were presented as a function
of applied electric field strength in Figure 11.

Figure 10 Strain-dependent elastic stress under different
electric field
strengths.

Figure 11 Electric-field-dependent
elastic (closed) and dynamic yield stresses
(open).

Dynamic yield stresses plotted
in Figure 11 were
deduced from Table 1. As shown in Figure 10, both elastic and dynamic yield stresses
were observed to be dependent on the electric field strength applied
for MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension with
the following power–law relationship of eq 5 5  where τy represents
either elastic or dynamic yield stress and E is the
electric field strength. In this work, the exponent equal to 1.5 is
matched with a well-known conduction model.45,46 Therefore, it can be concluded that the behavior of MCTP–Fe3O4 particles in ER fluid was governed by the mismatch
of conductivity between the particles and carrier liquid rather than
the mismatch of dielectric constant.47

Furthermore, the dependence of angular frequency on G′ and G″ for MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension was investigated in a fixed strain
of 0.02%, in which the electric field strength induced columnar formation
will not be destroyed by excessive strains. Without an electric field
applied, both G′ and G″
showed distinct increments with angular frequency (Figure 12). However, under an external
electric field, both G′ and G″ showed mostly stable values in the whole frequency window,
implying that the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER
suspension transformed from a fluid-like state to a solid-like form
by an application of electric field.48

frequency sweep tests: storage (closed) and loss moduli
(open) vs. frequency for different electric field strengths.

To further investigate the phase
transition of the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER
suspension from a fluid-like state
to a solid-like state, we evaluated shear relaxation moduli [G(t)] through angular-frequency-dependent
storage [G′(ω)] and loss modulus [G″(ω)] using the Schwarzl equation49 as shown in eq 6: 6  The value of G(t) was presented
as a function of time in Figure 13, where G(t) dropped
sharply when there was no
electric field, showing a liquid-like state. However, it remained
relatively stable in the entire timescale under an external electric
field, meaning a phase change to a solid-like phase.

relaxation moduli for different electric field
strengths.

In addition, to verify
the stability of the ER fluid, the shear
stress curves of the initial test (closed symbols) and the shear stress
curves remeasured after the steady shear and dynamic oscillation tests
(open symbols) without and with an electric field (0.5 kV/mm) are
shown in Figure 14. Obviously, there is no significant difference between the two experimental
results, indicating that the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER fluid has good stability and the ER performance is not
easily reduced because of the ER tests.

of an initial test (closed) and after the steady
shear and dynamic oscillation tests (open) for MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER fluid.

As known, the dielectric characteristics of ER suspension
were
closely linked with the ER properties, and Figure 15 shows the dielectric characteristics of
the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension, where
the curves were fitted from the following Cole–Cole equation:50 7  Here, ε* is the complex
dielectric constant, ε′ is the dielectric constant, and
ε″ is the loss factor. Δε = ε0 – ε∞ represents the polarizability
of ER suspension, and ε0 and ε∞ are dielectric constant values at frequencies reaching 0 and ∞,
respectively. ω is the angular frequency of applied electric
field; λ = 1/2πfmax is the
relaxation time of interfacial polarization between the particles
and carrier liquid in ER suspension with the electric field, where fmax is the frequency of where the loss factor
is maximal. The exponent (1 – α) reflects the distribution
broadness of the λ, when the α equals 0, meaning a single
relaxation time. Table 2 shows the fitted results of the Cole–Cole equation. It should
be noted that small λ and Δε usually can contribute
to high enhancement of shear stresses of ER suspension under an electric
field.51 As shown, the Δε of
MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension was 2.85,
which is a relatively higher value. However, the λ was 0.135
s, indicating a sluggish polarization under an electric field, which
is most likely the evidence that MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension obeys the conduction model rather than the polarization
model.

Conclusions
MCTP–Fe3O4 composite was prepared
and characterized by SEM, TEM, FTIR, and XRD. The chain-like structure
of the MCTP–Fe3O4 composite dispersed
in silicone oil in the presence of electric field strengths was directly
observed by OM. ER characteristics of MCTP–Fe3O4-based and MCTP-based ER suspensions were tested by a rotational
rheometer, and the ER performance of the former conformed to the conduction
model, which was closely related to its electrical conductivity. In
addition, the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER fluid
showed better ER properties than pure MCTP-based one, being attributed
to the excellent association of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
and the synergistic effect between the two components in the composite.

Experimental
Characterization
The morphological and structural characteristics
of MCTP–Fe3O4 composite particles were
investigated using both high-resolution scanning electron microscopy
(HR-SEM, SU-8010, Hitachi, Japan), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, CM200, Philips), and Fourier transform infrared vacuum spectrometry
(FTIR, Bruker VERTEX 80V, Germany). Their crystalline characteristics
were observed by a multipurpose X-ray diffractometer (MP-XRD, Pro
MRD, Netherlands). The magnetization curve was observed by vibrating
sample magnetometry (7407, USA). The ER tests of the MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension were carried out using a
rotational rheometer with a Couette geometry cell (MCR 300, Anton
Parr, Austria) attached by a high-voltage dc generator.

Synthesis of
MCTP–Fe3O4 Composite
MCTP was
prepared as previously reported.52 First,
cyanuric chloride and 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene were mixed in
dichloromethane (100 mL). Once anhydrous AlCl3 was added
into the mixture under a nitrogen environment, it was refluxed for
16 h using a condenser at 70 °C. Finally, the temperature of
the reacted solution mixture was lowered down to room temperature,
and brownish black product particles were obtained through sequential
processes of filtration, cleaning, and drying under vacuum.

The MCTP–Fe3O4 composite particles were
prepared by introducing Fe3O4 onto MCTP by a
chemical coprecipitation method.53 One
gram of MCTP was dispersed in 100 mL of a solution containing ferric
chloride hexahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and ferrous chloride tetrahydrate
(Sigma Aldrich, USA) in concentrations of 0.02 and 0.01 M, respectively.
The mixture was transferred to a reactor and stirred for 1 h, followed
by adding 1 M NaOH (Sigma Aldrich). The reaction mixture was heated
up to 60 °C and remained for 3 h. The precipitated product particles
were collected by a magnet, cleaned using water and acetone, and dried.

Preparation of ER Fluids
For ER measurements, MCTP–Fe3O4-based ER suspension was fabricated by suspending
MCTP–Fe3O4 in a silicone oil (shear viscosity
= 9.65 × 10–2 Pa s) with a sample volume concentration
of 5 vol %. For a uniform and better dispersion of the particles,
it was shaken (Vortex Genius 3, IKA, Germany) and sonicated (Power
Sonic 410, Hwashin Tech. Co., Korea). For comparison, MCTP-based ER
suspension (5 vol %) with the same concentration was also prepared
similarly.
