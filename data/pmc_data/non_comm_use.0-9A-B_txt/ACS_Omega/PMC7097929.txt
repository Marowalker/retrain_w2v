The Na2UF8 complex is an important intermediate
compound in the purification of UF6 by the adsorption–desorption
process during fluoride volatility of the spent nuclear fuel, and
its decomposition is seriously affected by temperature and atmosphere.
In this study, the thermal stability of Na2UF8 in the argon atmosphere was investigated by the in situ Raman spectroscopy.
The decomposition products of Na2UF8 at different
temperatures were systematically determined by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy
and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The results indicated
that Na2UF8 on the NaF sorbent was stable under
300 °C in the argon atmosphere, and it started to decompose into
UF6 and NaF rapidly when the temperature was above 300
°C. Meanwhile, a small amount of Na2UF8 was converted to Na3UF7, and it was stable
in the temperature range from 350 to 450 °C. The decomposition
mechanism of the Na2UF8 and the formation mechanism
of Na3UF7 on the NaF sorbent were speculated
according to the experimental results.

Introduction
In recent years, the Generation IV reactor systems, with better
economy, safety, and sustainability, represented by the molten salt
reactor, fast reactor, supercritical water reactor, and very high-temperature
reactor, have received much attention in worldwide.1 Because of the high burn-up or special fuel type of such
reactors, the traditional aqueous reprocessing technologies are not
satisfactory for the treatment of the spent nuclear fuel. With the
advantages of high radiation resistance, compact facilities, less
generation of waste, and so forth, pyroprocessing technologies have
been considered as the best choice to treat high burn-up spent fuel,2 and the fluoride volatility process (FVP), based
on the different volatilities between uranium hexafluoride (UF6) and fission product fluoride, has been regarded as a promising
pyroprocessing technology for separating uranium from the spent nuclear
fuel.3−5

The FVP mainly includes the fluorination of uranium compounds and
the purification of the UF6 product. As the most widely
used adsorption material in the purification of the UF6 product, the NaF sorbent can selectively remove impurities from
UF6 through adsorption and desorption processes. The Na2UF8 complex forms during the adsorption of UF6 on NaF sorbent, and the complex can decompose reversibly
to UF6 and NaF with the increase of the temperature. This
reversible reaction between UF6 and NaF is of great significance
for the separation of the volatile impurities from the UF6 product.6−8 Our previous study indicated that Na2UF8 was stable in anhydrous environment, and the obvious desorption
of UF6 from NaF sorbent occurred when the temperature exceeded
200 °C with a maximal desorption rate of UF6 at 330
°C. We also found that the desorption behavior of UF6 from the NaF sorbent in the fluorine atmosphere was similar to that
in the argon atmosphere, while the amount of the uranium residue on
the NaF sorbent after desorption in the argon atmosphere (1.68 mg
U/g NaF) was significantly larger than that in the F2 atmosphere
(0.006 mg U/g NaF).9 Cathers et al.10 speculated that the uranium residue on the NaF
sorbent was the nonvolatile NaF–UF5 complex when
the Na2UF8 complex was heated to 200–450
°C in nitrogen, and the NaF–UF5 complex was
further converted into the NaF–UF4 complex when
the temperature was above 450 °C. By dissolving and analyzing
the spent NaF from sorption columns of Chemical Combine, Gromov et
al.11 proposed that Na2UF8 (UF6·2NaF) was decomposed into UF6 and NaF directly in the range of 300–400 °C, and it
could be transformed into Na2UF7 (UF5·2NaF) in the range of 350–500 °C and then be further
converted into Na2UF6 (UF4·2NaF)
when the temperature increased to 500–600 °C. Above off-line
analysis results indicated that the decomposition of the Na2UF8 complex in the inert atmosphere would lead to the
formation of the uranium residue on the NaF sorbent, and the temperature
also had an important influence on the chemical form of the uranium
residue.

The total desorption of UF6 from the NaF sorbent is
very important for the recovery of U and the reuse of NaF. In order
to elucidate the mechanism of the formation of the uranium residue
on the NaF sorbent, in situ Raman spectroscopy, a very useful in situ
nondestructive assay surface characterization method was used to monitor
the real-time and dynamic microstructure change of Na2UF8 in the decomposition process in argon at different temperatures.
Furthermore, the chemical morphology and the coordination structure
of the uranium residue on the NaF sorbent were determined by X-ray
diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure
spectroscopy (XAFS).

Results and Discussion
Effect of Temperature on Decomposition Behavior of the Na2UF8 Complex
The Na2UF8 complex is an important intermediate in UF6 purification
processes based on adsorption and desorption on the NaF sorbent and
temperature plays an important role in its decomposition behavior.
In order to study the decomposition behavior of the Na2UF8 complex and formation mechanism of the uranium residue
on the NaF sorbent in argon, the in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis
technique was used to monitor the stability of Na2UF8 on the NaF sorbent.

As shown in Figure 1a, there existed several peaks locating at
170, 286, 306, 345, 375, 411, and 609 cm–1 at room
temperature, which was consistent with our previous work.9 The characteristic vibrational frequency at 609
cm–1 was assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration
of the U–F bond of Na2UF8, and it slightly
red-shifted with the increase of the temperature (as shown in Table 1). At the same time,
the peaks below 500 cm–1 gradually widened apparently,
which was because of the increase of the U–F bond length and
the amplitude of the corresponding stretching vibration. In addition,
a new weak band appeared around 818 cm–1 when the
temperature reached 300 °C as shown in Figure 1a. As the temperature continued to increase
to about 320 °C, the intensity of characteristic vibrational
frequency around 603 cm–1 became very weak, and
some new vibrational frequencies appeared at 278, 562, and 818 cm–1, which implied that most of Na2UF8 were decomposed and some new compound formed on the NaF sorbent.

Figure 1 In situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of (a) Na2UF8 and (b) blank NaF.

Table 1 Characteristic Vibrational Frequency
of Na2UF8 at Different Temperatures
temperature (°C)	25	100	150	200	250	300	
wavenumber (cm–1)	609	608	607	606	604	603	
The vibrational frequency of Na2UF8 around
603 cm–1 completely disappeared above 320 °C,
and the vibrational frequencies of the new compound almost remain
unchanged in the temperature range of 350–450 °C, which
means that the Na2UF8 complex was unstable above
320 °C in the argon atmosphere by decomposition to NaF and UF6. Moreover, the new compound might also transform from Na2UF8, and it was stable under 450 °C. As shown
in Figure 1b, the blank
NaF sorbent was tested as the reference under the same conditions,
and no observable band was found in the Raman spectra from 25 to 450
°C.

To further determine the decomposition process of the Na2UF8 complex, the micromorphology of the Na2UF8 complex on the NaF sorbent before and after desorption
at different temperatures was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Merlin compact, ZEISS, Germany). As shown in Figure 2, it was observed that the
Na2UF8 complex coating on the surface of the
NaF crystalline grain was a thick and compact layer (Figure 2a,b) at room temperature. The
complex layer became thin and sparse due to the release of UF6 when the temperature was 300 °C (Figure 2c,d). Compared to the blank NaF sorbent,9 the surface of NaF crystalline grains became
rough and uneven at 350 °C (Figure 2e,f), and the Na2UF8 complex completely disappeared.

Figure 2 Micromorphology of cross sections of the Na2UF8 complex before (a,b) and after desorption at 300 °C (c,d) and
350 °C (e,f).

From the abovementioned results, it can be confirmed that Na2UF8 is relatively stable in the argon atmosphere
below 300 °C; most Na2UF8 were decomposed
into NaF and UF6 when the temperature was above 320 °C;
meanwhile, a small amount of Na2UF8 might transform
into a new compound.

Chemical Morphological Analysis of the Uranium Residue on the
NaF Sorbent
In order to ascertain the chemical morphology
of the corresponding compound formed when the temperature was above
300 °C, XRD characterization of Na2UF8 and
the residues obtained after desorption at 300, 350, and 400 °C
were carried out, respectively.

As shown in Figure 3a,b, the chemical morphology
of the uranium residue on the NaF sorbent after desorption at 300
°C was still Na2UF8. The content of uranium
on the NaF sorbent decreased from 474 mg U/g NaF (as shown in Table 2) to 433 mg U/g NaF
after desorption at 300 °C for 1 h, which indicated that the
desorption of UF6 from the NaF sorbent was slow when the
temperature was below 300 °C, and only a small amount of Na2UF8 was decomposed into NaF and UF6,
which was consistent with the results of Raman spectra analysis.

[(a) Na2UF8, (b,c,d) after desorption at 300,
350, and 400 °C, respectively].

Na2UF8	25	474

As shown in Figure 3c,d, a new compound, namely, Na3UF7 (or UF4·3NaF), formed when the desorption temperature was 350
and 400 °C, and it remained on the NaF sorbent stably; the characteristic
vibrational frequencies at 278, 562, and 818 cm–1 might attribute to this compound. The results of inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis (as shown in Table 2) show that the content
of the uranium residue on the NaF sorbent after desorption at 350
and 400 °C for 1 h was 44.6 and 35.8 mg U/g NaF, respectively,
and on-line analysis of the infrared spectrometer manifested that
the most of uranium desorbed from the NaF sorbent was in the form
of UF6 (characteristic absorption peak at 625 cm–1, as shown in Figure 4).12

desorption.

To further determine the change of the valence state and the coordination
structure, the Na2UF8 before and after desorption
at different temperatures was characterized by XAFS based on Shanghai
synchrotron radiation facility. The near-edge absorption peaks of
U L3 in these samples are shown in Figure 5a. Quantitative information about the local
structures could be extracted by fitting the EXAFS data. The fits
are plotted in Figure 5b,c, and the fitting results are listed in Table 3.

°C.

It can be seen from Figure 5a that the near-edge absorption edges of U L3 of
Na2UF8 and after desorption at 300 °C were
almost identical, and the absorption edges of U L3 after
desorption at 350 and 400 °C were also consistent. The absorption
edge energy of U L3 of the uranium residue after desorption
at 350 and 400 °C (the purple and the green lines) shifted about
2 eV to the low energy when they were compared to that of Na2UF8 before and after desorption at 300 °C (the black
and the red lines), which indicated that the valence of uranium in
the Na2UF8 complex was declined when the temperature
exceeded 300 °C.13−16

The coordination environment of the U atom in Na2UF8 before and after desorption at 300 °C was significantly
different from those after desorption at 350 and 400 °C. As shown
in Figure 5b,c, in
the R-range of 1–3.0 Å, the first two
fitted well with Na2UF8 and the other two fitted
well with Na3UF7. As shown in Table 3, the length of U–F bonds
in Na2UF8 before and after desorption at 300
°C was 2.11 ± 0.01 and 2.12 ± 0.04 Å, respectively;17 the U–F bond lengths after desorption
at 350 and 400 °C in the argon atmosphere were 2.18 ± 0.01
Å.18

The abovementioned results were consistent with the results of
XRD analysis, and it further verified that the valence of uranium
on the NaF sorbent was reduced from U (VI) to U (IV) after desorption.
However, no evidence showed that U (V) existed in the decomposition
process of Na2UF8 in our research, which may
be due to the structural instability of the UF5–NaF
complex. From the above experimental results, it can be concluded
that the Na2UF8 complex was relatively stable
in the range of 25–200 °C, and it began to decompose into
NaF and UF6 at a low desorption rate in the range of 250–300
°C; the desorption rate increased quickly when the temperature
was above 300 °C with most Na2UF8 decomposing
into NaF and UF6, according to eq 1 1  

Meanwhile, a small amount of Na2UF8 was converted
into Na3UF7 when the temperature was above 320
°C; according to eq 2, the Na3UF7 complex was very stable in the
range of 350–450 °C under the argon atmosphere, which
indicated that the desorption of UF6 from the NaF sorbent
should be conducted under the fluorine atmosphere for the purpose
of reducing the loss of uranium on the NaF sorbent and improving the
utilization efficiency of the NaF sorbent. 2  

Conclusions
The present study demonstrated that the thermal stability of Na2UF8 complex and the formation mechanism of uranium
residue during its decomposition under argon atmosphere. The results
obtained from in situ Raman spectroscopy, SEM, XRD and XAFS analysis
showed that the desorption of UF6 from Na2UF8 mainly went through the following stages in argon atmosphere,
Na2UF8 was decomposed into NaF and UF6 rapidly when the temperature was over 320 °C, at the same time,
a small amount of Na2UF8 complex was transformed
to Na3UF7. The Na3UF7 remained
on the NaF sorbent was stable in argon atmosphere even at 450 °C.
The formation mechanism of Na3UF7 was presumed
to be 3Na2UF8 → 2Na3UF7 + UF6↑ + 2F2↑. From the
results of this research, it can be concluded that temperature does
play an important role in the decomposition of Na2UF8, and to avoid the loss of the uranium and improve the reusability
of the NaF sorbent, desorption of UF6 from NaF sorbent
should be carried out under fluorine atmosphere.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Materials
NaF sorbent (φ: 4 ×
4 mm, specific surface area: 0.3–0.4 m2/g, porosity:
40–45%, strength: 6–8 kgf/cm2) was prepared
in our laboratory,19 UF4 was
supplied by North Nuclear Fuel Co., Ltd.; Ar (99.999%) provided by
Shanghai Xiangqun Special Gas Co., Ltd. was used as carrier gas in
the adsorption and desorption experiments; F2/He (20: 80
by volume, >99.99%) was provided by Beijing Hycegas Co., Ltd.

Preparation of Na2UF8 Complex
Na2UF8 complex was prepared on a home-made
experiment setup as shown in Figure 6. The preparation process was as follows: a certain
amount of NaF sorbent and UF4 powder were placed in first
adsorber and fluorinator, respectively; the F2/He gas was
used to pre-treat the fluorinator, pipeline and NaF sorbent to remove
the possible moisture and avoid the hydrolysis of prepared UF6; then, the temperature of the first adsorber and the fluorinator
was set to 100 and 380 °C, respectively; the UF6 produced
by the fluorination of UF4 was adsorbed by NaF sorbent
in the first adsorber, and Na2UF8 complex formed.
The fluorination process was monitored by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Frontier; ZnSe as a reference: 4200–550
cm–1; resolution: 4 cm–1; scanning
frequency: 32; optical path length: 10 cm). The second adsorber was
mainly used to recover UF6 penetrating from first adsorber.
The adsorption capacity of NaF sorbent for UF6 was determined
by electronic balance. The prepared Na2UF8 complex
was stored in a desiccator which was placed in the argon covered glovebox
(oxygen content <1 ppm) for subsequent experiments.

Figure 6 Flow diagram of the experimental setup.

In Situ Analysis of the Na2UF8 Complex
The in situ Raman spectra of the Na2UF8 complex
from 25 to 450 °C in the argon atmosphere were recorded using
a HORIBA Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer which was equipped
with a Linkam TS1000 microscopic heating furnace with a temperature
accuracy of ±1 °C. The test process was as follows: first,
the Na2UF8 complex sample was added into a Pt
crucible, which was placed in the furnace and sealed in the argon
covered glovebox; then, the furnace was connected to the Raman spectrometer
and heated to the setting temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min,
with introduction of pure argon at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The blank
NaF sorbent was also tested as reference under the same conditions.

Preparation of the Uranium Residue on the NaF Sorbent
In order to determine the chemical morphology of the uranium residue
on the NaF sorbent after desorption in the argon atmosphere, the desorption
experiments of the Na2UF8 complex were carried
out on the same experimental setup used in preparation of the Na2UF8 complex. First, the prepared Na2UF8 complex was loaded in the first adsorber, and pure
argon gas with a flow rate of 20 mL/min was inlet as carrier gas.
Then, both adsorbers and the pipeline were heated to 100 °C.
After the temperature reached 100 °C, the first adsorber was
heated to the specified temperature for desorption with the desorption
process being monitored by FTIR. The content of the uranium on the
NaF sorbent after desorption was measured by ICP-AES (Optima 8000,
PerkinElmer, USA).

Morphological Analysis of the Uranium Residue on the NaF Sorbent
The chemical morphology of uranium on the NaF sorbent before and
after desorption at different temperatures was characterized by standard
powder X-ray diffraction with CuKα radiation (XRD, PANalytical
X’Pert Pro MPD X-ray polycrystalline diffractometer, DY3614,
Netherlands) and XAFS. All of the samples were prepared in an argon
glovebox. The sample was wrapped with the polymer film to prevent
the contact with water and oxygen during the analysis process. The
diffraction patterns were obtained over a 2θ range of 10–90°
with a scanning step size of 0.01°.

The XAFS analysis process
was as follows: first, the sample was ground, pressed, and sealed
(to prevent the sample from contacting with water and oxygen in the
atmosphere during the analysis process) in the glovebox; second, the
XAFS analyses were carried out at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(SSRF) and BL14W1 beam experimental station20 with a Si(311) double crystal monochromator in the nonfocusing mode
for U L3-edge. The electron beam energy of the storage
ring was 3.5 GeV, and the maximum storage current was about 250 mA.
The L3-edge EXAFS data of U were analyzed by the standard
procedures in Demeter.21 The theoretical
phase and amplitude functions were calculated with the program FEFF
9.0.22 Finally, the fitting procedure was
performed on the k2-weighted FT-EXAFS
data from 2.2 to 11.5 Å–1. An R window of 1–3
Å was used for the fitting. The amplitude reduction factor S02 was fixed at 1 in the EXAFS fits,
and the shifts in the threshold energy ΔE0 were constrained to be the same value for all fitted shells.
The coordination numbers (N), interatomic distances
(r), and Debye–Waller factors (Δσ2) were left as free parameters.
