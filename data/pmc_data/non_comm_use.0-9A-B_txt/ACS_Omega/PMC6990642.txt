Multidrug membrane transporters can
extrude a wide range of substrates,
which cause multidrug resistance and ineffective treatment of diseases.
In this study, we used three different sized antibiotic drug nanocarriers
to study their size-dependent inhibitory effects against Bacillus subtilis. We functionalized 2.4 ± 0.7,
13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)
with a monolayer of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol and covalently linked
them with antibiotics (ofloxacin, Oflx). The labeling ratios of antibiotics
with NPs are 8.6 × 102, 9.4 × 103,
and 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules per NP, respectively.
We designed cell culture medium in which both BmrA and ΔBmrA
cells grew and functioned normally while ensuring the stabilities
of nanocarriers (nonaggregation). These approaches allow us to quantitatively
study the dependence of their inhibitory effect against two isogenic
strains of B. subtilis, WT (normal
expression of BmrA) and ΔBmrA (deletion of bmrA), upon the NP size, antibiotic dose, and BmrA expression. Our results
show that the inhibitory effects of nanocarriers highly depend on
NP size and antibiotic dose. The same amount of Oflx on 2.4 ±
0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm nanocarriers shows the
3× lower, nearly the same, and 10× higher inhibitory effects
than that of free Oflx, against both WT and ΔBmrA, respectively.
Control experiments of the respective sized AgMUNH2 NPs
(absence of Oflx) show insignificant inhibitory effects toward both
strains. Taken together, the results show multiple factors, such as
labeling ratios, multivalent effects, and pharmacodynamics (Oflx localization
and distribution), which might play the roles in the size-dependent
inhibitory effects on the growth of both WT and ΔBmrA strains.
Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of nanocarriers are independent
of the expression of BmrA, which could be attributed to the higher
efflux of nanocarriers by other membrane transporters in both strains.

Introduction
ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) membrane transporters are one of the
largest membrane transport superfamilies, and they exist in all living
organisms and play highly significant roles in biological functions.1−7 The ABC membrane transporters can selectively transport a wide variety
of substrates across cellular membranes, even though they share a
common modular architecture, two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and
two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). TMDs exhibit variable sequence
and topology and define substrate binding sites and transport passageway,
while the NBDs possess conserved sequences and bind and hydrolyze
ATP to provide the “power-stroke” for the transporters
to translocate the specific substrates across the cellular membrane.7−17 The multidrug ABC membrane transporters can extrude chemotherapeutic
agents out of bacteria or tumor cells, which causes multidrug resistance
(MDR) and ineffective treatment of diseases, underscoring the importance
of understanding their underlying mechanisms to design more effective
therapy.3,18−22

Bacillus subtilis (a Gram-positive
bacterium) is a widely used model organism to study multidrug ABC
transporters. Current studies show that there are 78 ABC transporters
in B. subtilis.23−25 BmrA (YvcC),
the ABC transporter of B. subtilis,
exhibits the highest homology to each half of P-gps (MDR1), HorA (40%
identity), and LmrA (42% identity), which makes it an excellent choice
to study multidrug ABC transporters.26 Fluoroquinolones
(e.g., Oflx, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and gemifloxacin)
are widely used antibiotics to treat a variety of respiratory and
urinary tract infections, which include pneumonia, chronic bronchitis,
and tuberculosis.27,28 The extensive use of conventional
antibiotics has led to the development of multiantibiotics resistance
and the creation of superbugs that cannot be effectively eradicated
by traditional antibiotics; hence, there is an urgent need to design
new types of antibiotics and unconventional drugs (e.g., nanomedicine)
to treat the infections.

Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) possess
unique physicochemical
properties. Their high surface-area-to-volume ratio allows them to
serve as effective drug carriers that offer high payloads, high permeability,
high local target concentrations, and high binding affinity due to
multivalence effects.29−31 Furthermore, the high surface-area-to-volume ratio
of NPs could also lead to high chemical reactivity, and bare NPs themselves
could serve as unconventional drugs to eradicate bacteria.29,31−33 In our previous studies, we found that Ag and Au
NPs at low concentrations do not inhibit cell growth and are biocompatible,
while a higher concentration of NPs was unstable in the buffer or
medium, which led to the aggregation of bare NPs on the surface of
the cellular membrane that causes cell death.30,32−40

We have successfully imaged single Ag NPs in solution, in
single
live cells, and single embryos and used their size-dependent plasmonic
optical properties to study size-dependent efflux functions of multidrug
membrane transporters in single live cells (both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria) in real time at nanometer resolution.33−36,38−51 We have also used their size-dependent plasmonic optical properties
to characterize the mode of action of antibiotics, such as aztreonam
and chloramphenicol, in single live Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells.37,40 Therefore, the plasmonic NP-based drug carriers
can serve as size-dependent photostable-sized imaging probes to study
size-dependent efflux kinetics of multidrug membrane transporters
and size-dependent MDR in situ in real time, while
nanocarriers are inhibiting the bacterial growth.

In our previous
study, we have designed, synthesized, purified,
and characterized three different sized antibiotic nanocarriers and
developed cell culture medium, in which P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) cells grew and functioned normally and
the nanocarriers remained unchanged (stable, nonaggregated).30 We found that their inhibitory effect against
two strains of P. aeruginosa, WT (normal
expression of MexAB-OprM) and ΔABM (deletion of MexAB-OprM),
highly depends upon the NP size, antibiotic dose, and multidrug membrane
transporter (MexAB-OprM) expression. In this study, we used the same
nanocarriers to study the dependence of inhibitory effect of the antibiotic
nanocarriers against Gram-positive bacteria, two strains of B. subtilis (Gram-positive bacteria), WT (normal
expression of BmrA) and ΔBmrA (deletion of bmrA), upon the size of nanocarriers, and dose of antibiotics (Oflx).
Note that MexAB-OprM and BmrA are two completely different types of
multidrug membrane transporters, energized by proton gradients across
the cellular membrane and ATP hydrolysis, respectively. Further, P. aeruginosa are Gram-negative bacteria, while B. subtilis are Gram-positive bacteria, and they
have very different cellular envelop structures. By comparing these
two studies, we aim to understand the dependence of inhibitory effects
of nanocarriers upon the types of multidrug membrane transporters
and the types of bacteria.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis, Purification,
and Characterization of Stable Drug
Nanocarriers
We synthesized, purified, and characterized
2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs. We
used the thiol group of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol hydrochloride (AUT)
to attach a monolayer of AUT (MUNH2) onto surface of NPs
to prepare AgMUNH2 NPs (Figure 1), as reported previously.30 We then used a peptide bond to covalently conjugate the
carboxyl group of Oflx with the amine group of AgMUNH2 NPs
to synthesize antibiotic drug nanocarriers (AgMUNH–Oflx) (Figure 1).30

Figure 1 Chemical reactions for the preparation of antibiotic drug nanocarriers
(AgMUNH–Oflx NPs): attaching monolayer of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol
onto the surface of (A) 2.4 ± 0.7, (B) 13.0 ± 3.1, and (C)
92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs to prepare AgMUNH2 NPs and then
linking the amine group of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol with the carboxyl
group of the Oflx via peptide bonds using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) and sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(NHS) as mediators to generate AgMUNH–Oflx NPs (antibiotic
drug nanocarriers).30

We purified the drug nanocarriers using centrifugation. We then
characterized the sizes of the NPs, AUT (MUNH2) on the
NPs, and conjugation ratios of Oflx molecules per NP for 2.4 ±
0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs as 8.6 × 102, 9.4 × 103, and 6.5 × 105 using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering
(DLS), NMR, and UV–vis spectroscopy, respectively.30

We used DLS and UV–vis spectroscopy
to study the stability
(nonaggregation) of antibiotic drug nanocarriers with desired concentrations
in a commonly used standard Lysogeny broth (LB) medium (1% tryptone,
0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl in deionized (DI) water, pH = 7.2)
in the shaker (MaxQ 5000, 200 rpm, 37 °C) for 12 h. We found
that they were aggregated.30 The aggregation
of nanocarriers would alter their sizes and cause potential precipitation
of nanocarriers from the medium that would reduce their doses and
make the study of dose- and size-dependent unreliable. Therefore,
we modified the cell culture medium by reducing the NaCl concentration
from 0.5 to 0.1% and found that the drug nanocarriers with desired
concentrations in the modified LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast
extract, and 0.1% NaCl in DI water, pH = 7.2) were stable (nonaggregated)
under the cell culture condition and duration, in the shaker (MaxQ
5000, 200 rpm, 37 °C) for 12 h.

Characterization of Cellular
Functions in the Modified Medium
We characterized the viability
and efflux function of the cells
cultured in the modified medium to make certain that the modified
cell culture medium can be used to culture healthy and well-functional
cells as those cultured in the standard cell culture medium. We precultured
the cells (WT-BmrA and ΔBmrA) in the standard medium for 12
h, then cultured the precultured cells in the standard medium and
the modified medium, and followed the cell growth over time. The growth
curves of the cells cultured in the standard medium (Figure 2a) and the modified medium
(Figure 2b) for WT
(Figure 2A) and ΔBmrA
(Figure 2B) are the
same, showing that the cells grow normally in the modified cell culture
medium.

Figure 2 Study of the suitability of the modified LB medium to culture (A)
WT and ΔBmrA: the cellular growth curves of (A) WT and (B) ΔBmrA
cultured in (a) standard and (b) modified LB media over time show
that the growth rates of a given strain in either medium are nearly
identical, which indicates that the modified LB medium can be used
to culture both WT and ΔBmrA cells.

We then used live/dead BacLight assay to determine
the viability of the cells, which had been cultured in the standard
and modified media over 17 h. For live/dead BacLight
assay,52 green fluorescent dye (SYTO9,
λmax = 520 nm) stains only live cells, while a red
fluorescent dye (propidium iodide, λmax = 610 nm)
can only diffuse into the dead cells because of disintegrated cellular
membranes of dead cells. Thus, the live cells exhibit green fluorescent,
while dead cells display red fluorescent. The results in Figure 3 show that more than
97% of the cells cultured in both media over time exhibit SYTO9 green
fluorescence, which demonstrates that 97% of the cells are viable.
The results further demonstrate that the cells (BmrA and ΔBmrA)
cultured in the modified medium grow normally and they are viable.

in (a) standard and (b) modified LB medium using live/dead BacLight assay. (A) Optical and (B) fluorescence images
of the cells (e.g., WT) that were cultured over 12 h and suspended
in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and assayed using live/dead BacLight assay. The cells exhibiting green fluorescence
and red fluorescence are counted as live and dead cells, respectively.
(C) Plot of the percent of the live cells (number of live cells divided
by the total number of the cells) cultured in (a) standard and (b)
modified LB media shows that more than 97% of the cells (WT and ΔBmrA)
are viable, which further demonstrates that the modified LB medium
can be used to culture the cells. The scale bar is 5 μm.

To characterize the efflux function of multidrug
BmrA transporters
of live cells, we studied the BmrA-dependent efflux kinetics of intracellular
Hoechst dye (Hoechst 33342) in both WT and ΔBmrA live cells
using fluorescence spectroscopy.39,51,53−57 Hoechst dye molecules emit weak fluorescent outside the cells, and
their fluorescence intensity increases up to 10-folders as they enter
the cells and intercalate with DNA.26,58 Thus, the
time course fluorescence intensity of the dyes can be used to study
their accumulation kinetics inside live cells in real time. The fluorescence
intensity of the dyes incubated with ΔBmrA (absence of BmrA)
increases with time more rapidly (Figure 4b) than those of WT (Figure 4a), showing that the efflux of the dye molecules
out of the WT cells leads to a lower accumulation of intracellular
dye molecules in the WT than in ΔBmrA cells. The results show
the high BmrA-dependent efflux kinetics of intracellular dye in live
cells that were cultured in both standard and modified cell culture
media (Figure 4A,B),
respectively. The efflux kinetics of cells cultured in the standard
medium (Figure 4A)
are similar to those cells cultured in the modified medium, further
demonstrating that the modified cell culture medium is well suitable
to culture WT and ΔBmrA cells that preserve the efflux function
of multidrug BmrA membrane transporters.

Figure 4 Characterization of the
efflux function of membrane transporter
(BmrA) in WT and ΔBmrA cells cultured in (A) standard and (B)
modified LB medium. Time-dependent fluorescence intensity of 2 μM
Hoechst dye incubated with the cells (OD600 nm = 0.1
in PBS buffer, pH 7.2): (a) WT and (b) ΔBmrA cultured in (A)
standard and (B) modified LB media show nearly identical accumulation
and efflux kinetics, demonstrating that the cells cultured in the
modified LB medium possess well-functional efflux pump and the modified
LB medium can be used to culture the cells for the study of accumulation
and efflux kinetics of B. subtilis.

Study of Antibiotic Dose, NP Size, and BmrA
Expression-Dependent
Inhibitory Effects
We measured minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) of Oflx attached onto the nanocarriers to determine whether
inhibitory effects of antibiotic nanocarriers against the growth of
WT-BmrA and ΔBmrA depend on the NP size, Oflx dose, and BmrA
expression. The cells (WT or ΔBmrA) were cultured in the modified
LB medium containing a dilution series of free Oflx alone, each type
of the given sized drug nanocarriers (AgMUNH–Oflx NPs) and
AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx, control experiment), and
the cell growth was measured over time.

The dilution series
contains 0, 0.055, 0.11, 0.22, 0.42, and 0.72 μM of free Oflx
(Figure 5A,E) or Oflx
carried by the NPs (AgMUNH–Oflx NPs) for WT-BmrA (Figure 5B–D) and ΔBmrA
(Figure 5F–H),
respectively. The corresponding concentrations of nanocarriers (NP
concentration) are (Figure 5B: a–f) 0, 0.06, 0.13, 0.26, 0.49, and 0.83 nM for
(2.4 ± 0.7) nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules per NP; (Figure 5C: a–f) 0, 5.8 × 10–3, 1.2 × 10–2, 2.3 × 10–2, 4.5 × 10–2, and 7.6 × 10–2 nM for (13.0 ± 3.1) nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 9.4
× 103 Oflx molecules per NP; (Figure 5D: a–f) 0, 8.4 × 10–5, 1.7 × 10–4, 3.4 × 10–4, 6.4 × 10–4, and 1.1 × 10–3 nM for (92.6 ± 4.4) nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 6.5
× 105 Oflx molecules per NP, respectively. The control
experiments include the cells cultured with the LB medium alone (blank
control, Figure 5A,E:
a) or the medium containing 0.83, 7.6 × 10–2, or 1.1 × 10–3 nM AgMUNH2 NPs
(in the absence of Oflx, Figure 5B–H: a) for the (2.4 ± 0.7), (13.0 ±
3.1), or (92.6 ± 4.4) nm NPs, respectively. The control experiments
were conducted in parallel with the experiments with antibiotic nanocarriers
and at the same conditions.

Figure 5 Study of the dependence of inhibitory effects
of antibiotic nanocarriers
(AgMUNH–Oflx NPs) against the growth of (A–D) WT and
(E–H) ΔBmrA cells upon antibiotic dose, NP size, and
BmrA expression. Photographs of the LB medium cultured with (A–D)
the WT cells and (E–H) ΔBmrA containing (a–f)
0, 0.055, 0.11, 0.22, 0.42, and 0.72 μM of (A and E) unconjugated
free Oflx alone; (a–f) 0, 0.055, 0.11, 0.22, 0.42, and 0.72
μM of the Oflx conjugated with the Ag NPs of (B and F) 2.4 ±
0.7, (C and G) 13.0 ± 3.1, and (D and H) 92.6 ± 4.4 nm in
diameters, respectively. The concentrations of Oflx conjugated onto
the NPs are determined using their labeling ratios. The blank control
experiments include the concentrations of AgMUNH2 NPs in
(a) of (B–D and F–H) containing 0.83 nM, 7.6 ×
10–2 nM, or 1.1 pM AgMUNH2 NPs (in the
absence of Oflx) for 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, or 92.6 ±
4.4 nm NPs, which are the same concentrations of the NPs of nanocarriers
as those in (f) for each type of NPs (B–D and F–H),
respectively.

We quantitatively measured the
cell concentration over time by
measuring their OD600 nm (optical density at 600 nm)
at 5, 11, and 17 h, as shown in Figures S1 and S2 in the Electronic Online Supporting Information. Since nanocarriers
and NPs possess plasmonic optical properties and molecular absorption
at visible wavelengths, we subtracted the OD600 nm of the nanocarriers or AgMUNH2 NPs in the medium (in
the absence of the cells) from the OD600 nm of the
cell suspension with the nanocarriers or NPs to determine the cell
concentration, respectively. The subtracted OD600 nm of the cell suspension was plotted over time to determine the duration
(17 h) for the cell growth to reach equilibrium. The OD600 nm of the cell suspension at 17 h was then plotted versus the concentration
of Oflx alone or Oflx covalently conjugated with a given sized antibiotic
drug nanocarrier to determine the MIC of Oflx for each cell strain
(Figure 6). The result
shows that the inhibitory effects of Oflx highly depend on the dose
of Oflx and size of the nanocarriers but not on the cellular expression
of BmrA.

Figure 6 Study of dose-, size-, and BmrA-dependent MICs of antibiotic nanocarriers
(AgMUNH–Oflx NPs) against (A) WT and (B) ΔBmrA cells.
Plots of normalized OD600 nm of the cells cultured
for 17 h in the modified LB medium containing (a–c) AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx, control), (d) Oflx alone, and (e–g)
Oflx linked with (e) 2.4 ± 0.7, (f) 13.0 ± 3.1, and (g)
92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs, respectively. The concentrations of AgMUNH2 NPs in (a–c) of (A) and (B) are the same as the given
sized nanocarriers with the highest Oflx concentrations in (e–g)
for each type of NPs in (A) and (B), but without Oflx (control experiments
for the study of effects of NPs), respectively. The experimental data
(points) are fitted with an equation y = a e–bx, solid line as follows: (A): (d) y = 1.12 e–5.02×, R2 = 0.918;
(e) y = 1.10 e–1.964×, R2 = 0.841; (f) y =
1.11 e–6.53×, R2 = 0.881; (g) y = 1.00 e–55.48×, R2 = 1.000. (B): (d) y = 1.12 e–4.55×, R2 = 0.922; (e) y = 1.10 e–1.59×, R2 = 0.712;
(f) y = 1.09 e–7.09×, R2 = 0.906; (g) y =
1.00 e–52.01×, R2 = 1.000. The MICs (IC50) of free Oflx and linked
Oflx were determined at the half of the maximum of the normalized
OD600 nm for each curve (solid line).

Control experiments (Figure 6: a–c) show that the OD600 nm of the
cell suspension incubated with each of three different sized AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx) are nearly independent on the NP concentration
and nearly the same as those cultured in the medium alone. The result
indicates that the given concentration of AgMUNH2 NPs does
not generate significant inhibitory effects against the growth of
WT and ΔBmrA cells. Note that the NP concentration is the same
as that of the highest concentration of the given sized nanocarriers,
respectively. The studies have shown that the bare noble metal NPs
(Ag NPs) themselves can inhibit the growth of bacteria in a concentration-dependent
manner.32,59,60 Notably, the
NPs that are functionalized with the surface molecules (e.g., peptides)
exhibit biocompatibility of the surface molecules, instead of the
bare NPs.41,45,61 Thus, the
biocompatibility of AgMUNH2 NPs that we observed in the
study is most likely attributed to the surface functional molecules
(MUNH2) that are attached on the surface of the NPs.

On the contrary, the OD600 nm of the cell suspension
incubated with Oflx alone or Oflx attached onto the given sized nanocarriers
decrease as Oflx concentration increases, showing that their inhibitory
effects against the growth of WT and ΔBmrA cells highly depend
upon the dose of Oflx and size of nanocarriers (Figure 6A,B: d–f). We fitted the experimental
data with an exponential decay equation (y = a e–bx), which represents the inhibitory effect upon the exponential cell
growth. We define the concentration of Oflx needed to reduce the growth
of the cells in the medium alone to the half as the MIC of Oflx. The
results of MICs are summarized in Table 1, showing that the MICs of free Oflx and
Oflx attached onto the nanocarriers highly depend upon the dose of
Oflx and the size of nanocarriers but not the cellular expression
of BmrA.

a The experimental data was fitted
using the exponential decay equation (y = a e–bx) to determine
the parameters (a and b) with the highest
regression. The MIC of Oflx for each sample was determined at the
half of the cell growth of the blank control experiment (Figure 6).

For free Oflx alone (Figure 6A,B: d), the OD600 nm of the cell suspension
decrease with the Oflx concentration, showing the MICs of 0.16 ±
0.00 and 0.17 ± 0.02 μM Oflx for the WT and ΔBmrA
cells, respectively.

Interestingly, for 2.4 ± 0.7 nm drug
nanocarriers with a conjugation
ratio of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules/NP (Figure 6A,B: e), the OD600 nm of the cell suspension decrease with the Oflx concentration less
rapidly than those of free Oflx and two other larger nanocarriers.
Notably, for 13.0 ± 3.1 nm drug nanocarriers with a conjugation
ratio of 9.4 × 103 Oflx molecules/NP (Figure 6A,B: f), the OD600 nm of the cell suspension decreases with the Oflx concentration are
nearly the same as those of free Oflx, showing the nearly identical
inhibitory and MICs of 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.11 ± 0.01 μM
Oflx for the WT and ΔBmrA cells, as those of free Oflx, respectively.
For 92.6 ± 4.4 nm drug nanocarriers with a conjugation ratio
of 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules/NP (Figure 6A,B: g), the OD600 nm of
the cell suspension decrease with the Oflx concentration the most
rapidly, showing the highest inhibitory effects and the lowest MICs
of 0.012 ± 0.001 and 0.012 ± 0.001 μM Oflx for the
WT and ΔBmrA cells, respectively.

The MICs of either free
Oflx or Oflx attached onto nanocarriers
for WT-BmrA and ΔBmrA cells are the same, suggesting that either
form of Oflx could be extruded out of the cells by other membrane
transporters in both WT-BmrA and ΔBmrA. In other words, Oflx
is not a specific substrate of BmrA, and other membrane transporters
are primary forces to extrude the Oflx out of the cells, which leads
to the insignificant (or masked) contribution of BmrA and the BmrA-independent
MICs of Oflx.

Comparison of Both Studies and Distinctive
Findings
By comparing the results in this study with our
previous study,30 we found that Oflx attached
onto the nanocarriers
retains its efficacy (inhibitory effect) against both Gram-positive
bacteria (B. subtilis) and Gram-negative
bacteria (P. aeruginosa). Inhibitory
effects of nanocarriers against both strains of bacteria highly depend
upon the size of nanocarriers, further demonstrating that the closed-packed
Oflx molecules on the NPs (multivalence) could increase local drug
dose, enhance their binding affinity with the target, and offer higher
potency against both B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa. Notably, the inhibitory effects of
nanocarriers are not linearly proportional to their sizes. For example,
the smallest antibiotic nanocarriers (2.4 ± 0.7 nm) show the
lowest inhibitory effects and the highest MICs against both strains
than free Oflx, while the mid-sized nanocarriers (13.0 ± 3.1
nm) display the nearly identical inhibitory effects and MICs as free
Oflx, and the largest antibiotic nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4 nm)
exhibit the highest inhibitory effects and the lowest MICs against
both strains.

The primary difference between both studies is
their inhibitory effects on two different types of the cells (B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa) and their dependence on the efflux pump. For the previous study,30 the inhibitory effects of nanocarriers highly
depend upon the expression of MexAB-OprM (multidrug membrane transporter)
of P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacterium).
In this study, they are independent upon the expression of BmrA (multidrug
membrane transporter) of B. subtilis (Gram-positive bacterium). Therefore, the inhibitory effects of
nanocarriers against bacteria show the selectivity, suggesting the
possibility of using them as medicines. Notably, all three sized nanocarriers
can enter B. subtilis (Gram-positive
bacteria) and P. aeruginosa(Gram-negative
bacteria), even though B. subtilis (Gram-positive
bacteria) possess a very different envelop structure from P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria), suggesting
potential common applications against bacteria. Further, the results
demonstrate that antibiotic drug nanocarriers show specificity toward
the given membrane transporters and their potentially wide utility
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Summary
In summary, we have successfully used three different sized antibiotic
drug nanocarriers (AgMUNH–Oflx NPs) to study their size-dependent
inhibitory effects against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, WT-BmrA, and ΔBmrA). We
have designed a modified cell culture medium, which enables the WT-BmrA
and ΔBmrA cells to grow normally and the antibiotic drug nanocarriers
to be stable (nonaggregated) in the medium over the entire duration
of cell culture (17 h). Thus, the size and dose of nanocarriers remain
unchanged during their incubation with the cells for 17 h, enabling
us to study the size- and dose-dependent effects of the drug nanocarriers
on the cell growth and efflux function of BmrA. Control experiments
of three sized AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx) show insignificant
inhibitory effects toward WT-BmrA and ΔBmrA, which are likely
attributed to the surface functional molecules (MUNH2)
attached onto the NPs. The significant findings include that (i) the
largest nanocarriers create the highest inhibitory effects, while
the smallest nanocarriers generate the lowest inhibitory effects,
demonstrating that the same number of antibiotic molecules (Oflx)
that are carried and delivered by the larger NPs can produce the higher
inhibitory effects. These results indicate that the closed-packed
Oflx molecules on the surface of NPs might strengthen their binding
affinity with the target (multivalence) and provide larger payload
to increase local targeting dose, leading to the higher potency. (ii)
The inhibitory effects of Oflx depend upon the multivalent local targeting
effects, as well as their intracellular distribution and concentrations.
(iii) Their inhibitory effects do not significantly depend upon the
cellular expression of multidrug BmrA membrane transporter, suggesting
that other transporters in ΔBmrA could effectively extrude the
antibiotic nanocarriers out of the ΔBmrA cells, leading to the
same MICs as WT-BmrA. These findings show that the inhibitory effects
of nanocarriers are not linearly proportional to their sizes, suggesting
the possibility for one to design the optimal-sized nanocarriers to
create the most potent effect of antibiotics against a specific given
bacterial strain and to potentially evade a specific given multidrug
membrane transporter. Efforts are being made to identify the specific
membrane transporters that are responsible for the extrusion of drug
nanocarriers out of WT-BmrA and ΔBmrA cells and to study their
underlying molecular mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Characterization
of Cell Culture
We used two strains
of Gram-positive bacterial cells (B. subtilis): WT (normal expression BmrA) and ΔBmrA previously named as
ΔYvcC (a mutant strain that is devoid of the bmrA, also named as ΔyvcC or ΔbmrA) that were isogenic strains and provided by Jault.26 The cells were first precultured in a commonly used standard
LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl in DI water,
pH = 7.2) in a shaker (MaxQ 5000, 200 rpm, 37 °C) for 12 h. The
precultured cells (20 μL) were then further cultured in the
2 mL standard LB medium or the modified LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5%
yeast extract, and 0.1% NaCl in DI water, pH = 7.2) in a shaker (MaxQ
5000, 200 rpm, 37 °C) for another 17 h. The cell growth curves
were determined by measuring the OD600 nm of cell
suspension in the medium over 17 h of cell culture. The cell suspension
was diluted to the OD600 nm of cell suspension below
0.2 and measured.

By the end of cell culture, we used live/dead BacLight viability and counting assay (Invitrogen) to assay
the viability of the cultured cells.52 We
used dark-field optical microscopy and epi-fluorescence microscopy
to image the cells in a microchamber containing the medium.33,37,39,40,53 We acquired the green and red fluorescence
cell images and counted them as live and dead cells, respectively.

By the end of the cell culture, we used centrifugation to harvest
the cells (Beckman JA-14, 7500 rpm) and rinsed the cells with the
PBS buffer (0.5 mM phosphate buffer, 1.5 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) three times.
We suspended the cells in the PBS buffer and adjusted to a desired
cell suspension concentration (OD600 nm = 0.1) in
the buffer. We continuously measured the fluorescence intensity of
Hoechst 3342 dye (Invitrogen) of the cell suspension (OD600 nm = 0.1) containing 2 μM of the dye at a 3 s time interval for
2 h using a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS50B) with the
excitation and emission wavelengths at 350 and 488 nm, respectively.

Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization of Drug Nanocarriers
We synthesized and characterized the antibiotic drug nanocarriers,
as reported previously.30 Briefly, we synthesized,
purified, and characterized (2.4 ± 0.7), (13.0 ± 3.1), and
(92.6 ± 4.4) nm Ag NPs, as reported previously.39,42,62 We used centrifugation to thoroughly
wash the NPs three times with the DI water immediately after the synthesis.
We used UV–vis spectroscopy (Hitachi U-2010), dark-field optical
microscopy and spectroscopy (DFOMS), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (JEOL, JEM-2100F), and dynamic light scattering
(DLS) (Nicomp 380ZLS particle sizing system) to measure the NP concentrations,
the LSPR images, the spectra of single NPs, and the sizes of single
NPs, respectively.33,36,37,39,42−45,47,49,55,62 We used the
interaction of thiol groups of MUNH2 with the NPs to attach
11-amino-1-undecanethiol hydrochloride (MUNH2, AUT, 99%,
Sigma-Aldrich) onto the surface of NPs to prepare functional AgMUNH2 NPs. We used centrifugation (Beckman Optima L90k, 4 °C)
to wash the AgMUNH2 NPs thoroughly with DI water three
times to remove excess MUNH2. We used a two-step method
via 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)
and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (s-NHS) as mediators
to link the amine groups of each sized AgMUNH2 NPs with
the carboxyl group of Oflx via peptide bonds (Figure 1). We used centrifugation to wash the nanocarriers
with DI water to purify the drug nanocarriers (AgMUNH–Oflx
NPs) and stored them at 4°C for future use. We used UV–vis
spectroscopy, DFOMS, and DLS to characterize the concentrations, optical properties,
and sizes of each sized AgMUNH2 NPs, respectively.

We used UV–vis absorbance spectra of Oflx at 288 nm and the
plasmonic absorption spectra of the NPs to measure the molar concentration
of Oflx and NPs, respectively. We then divided the molar concentrations
of Oflx molecules on the surface of the nanocarriers by the molar
concentration of the NPs to determine the molar labeling ratios of
antibiotics (Oflx) to NPs for each sized drug nanocarriers.30

Study of Stability of Drug Nanocarriers in
Cell Culture Medium
We used UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
DLS, and dark-field
optical microscopy and spectroscopy to characterize the concentration,
size, and optical properties of nanocarriers and studied their stability
(nonaggregation) in the commonly used standard LB medium and the modified
medium over 24 h, respectively. We found that the given concentrations
of 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm nanocarriers
(6.0 nM, 0.8 nM, and 7 pM) are stable (nonaggregated) in the modified
medium over 24 h, but they are unstable (aggregated) in the standard
medium.30

Characterization of Dose-
and Size-Dependent Inhibitory Effects
of Nanocarriers
The cells (WT or ΔBmrA) were precultured
in the standard LB medium overnight and then cultured in the modified
LB medium (2.5 mL) containing a dilution series of free Oflx alone,
given sized drug nanocarriers (AgMUNH–Oflx NPs), and AgMUNH2 NPs (control experiments) by inoculating 104 precultured
cells into the medium in a shaker (200 rpm, 37 °C) over 17 h.

The dilution series of 0, 0.055, 0.11, 0.22, 0.42, and 0.72 μM
free Oflx or Oflx conjugated with the NPs (AgMUNH–Oflx NPs)
were prepared in the modified cell culture medium to culture WT and
ΔBmrA (Figure 5). They are correlated with the drug nanocarrier (NP) concentrations:
(i) 0, 0.06, 0.13, 0.26, 0.49, and 0.83 nM for (2.4 ± 0.7) nm
NPs with a conjugation ratio of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules
per NP; (ii) 5.8 × 10–3, 1.2 × 10–2, 2.3 × 10–2, 4.6 × 10–2, and 7.6 × 10–2 nM for (13.0
± 3.1) nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 9.4 × 103 Oflx molecules per NP; and (iii) 8.4 × 10–2, 1.7 × 10–1, 3.4 × 10–1, 6.4 × 10–1, and 1.11 pM for (92.6 ±
4.4) nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 6.5 × 105 Oflx
molecules per NP. The control experiments include the modified LB
medium only (blank control) and containing 0.83 nM, 7.6 × 10–2 nM, or 1.1 pM AgMUNH2 NPs (in the absence
of Oflx) for 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, or 92.6 ± 4.4 nm
NPs, respectively.

We quantitatively determined the OD600 nm of the
cell suspension in a 96-well plate using a plate reader (BioTek Synergy
HT) equipped with a UV–vis absorption spectral detector at
5, 11, and 17 h. We plotted the OD600 nm of the cell
suspension vs time to determine the duration (17 h) for the cells
to reach the confluence. We then used the plots of the OD600 nm of each cell suspension at 17 h versus Oflx concentration (free
Oflx or Oflx attached onto the nanocarrier) to determine their inhibitory
effects (MIC). Specifically, we normalized the OD600 nm of each cell suspension with the maximum OD600 nm (the cells cultured in the medium alone, blank control), respectively.
We plotted the normalized OD600 nm of the cell suspension
versus the concentration of free Oflx (Oflx alone) or the concentration
of Oflx attached onto a given sized drug nanocarrier. We used the
exponential decay (y = a e–bx) to fit the experimental data and
to determine the parameters (a, b) of the equation with
the highest possible regression. The MIC50 (the concentration
of Oflx at which the cell growth was inhibited to the half of the
cell growth of the blank control experiment) was then determined.
Unlike conventional semiquantitative methods to estimate the MICs
using solid culture plates (a colony-forming unit), we developed this
new approach to quantitatively determine the MIC50 using
the dilution series of antibiotics or antibiotic nanocarriers in the
liquid LB medium and mathematically fitting the experimental data.
Further, the dilution series of antibiotics in the liquid LB medium
enabled the nanocarriers to be well dispersed and avoided the aggregation
of nanocarriers in the solid culture plates and allowed us to characterize
the stability of nanocarriers in the liquid medium in real time at
single NP resolution.
