A high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed
to simultaneously quantify three widely used active substances such
as coenzyme Q10, phosphatidylserine, and vitamin C. This new method
optimizes current timing and costs in the analyses of these three
active substances. Additionally, since the analyzed compounds were
encapsulated on a cutting-edge liposomal formulation, further processing
was necessary to be developed prior to HPLC analyses. The technique
was studied and adequately validated in accordance with the guidelines
of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements
for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) regarding selectivity, linearity,
accuracy, precision, and robustness. After data treatment of results,
linear regressions for all active substances showed an optimal linearity
with a correlation coefficient of >0.999 in the concentration range
between 70 to 130% of the liposomal formulation and less than a 3%
relative standard deviation (RSD) in accuracy and precision.

==== Body
Introduction
During the past years,
science is accomplishing huge advances in
drug discovery through modeling and synthesis toward the treatment
of idiopathic diseases.1−4 However, even if promising molecules are identified and synthesized,
its effectiveness will be reduced or equal to zero if they are unable
to achieve the therapeutic target because of a poor absorption. It
is estimated that, nowadays, 90% of the developed molecules on investigation
are chemically lipophilic drugs or, in other words, insoluble drugs
in water and unable to cross physiological barriers on oral administration.5,6

To enhance drug bioavailability of lipophilic actives, the
liposomal
technology of encapsulation has been a broadly reported vehicle during
the past decades on the literature. Discovered by Bangham and Horne
in 1964,7 this lipid spherical structure
allows the insoluble active substances in water to get intertwined
with the forming phospholipids of the membrane, while hydrophilic
actives can also be encapsulated in its aqueous core. Among many other
benefits, this has converted them in an extensively used and very
versatile drug delivery technology.8−12

Herein, we describe a novel method of analysis
for the simultaneous
quantification of three coencapsulated active substances with very
similar characteristics of hydrophobicity in a liposomal matrix, and
also, we explain the pretreatment procedure for these liposomal samples
prior to analyses. Specifically, the coanalyzed active substances
are the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), 6-O-palmitoyl-l-ascorbic acid (the lipid-soluble vitamin C), and phosphatidylserine
(PS). These active substances are widely used in both basic research
and in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industry, thus having
a high interest and also a huge impact in the economic ambit. In the
past 10 years, 5651 articles related with CoQ10 were published in
scientific journals, 6969 articles related to PS, and 46,079 articles
related with vitamin C, all of them with an exponential tendency of
increase on each year.13 Although many
articles have been published describing analytical methodologies of
each substance in separate, to the best of our knowledge, there is
no published method offering the simultaneous analysis of the three
active substances, and even less coencapsulated within the liposomal
technology and the additional elements, this means to be considered
upon analysis. To the proper determination and quantification of the
active substances, it is important to have clear absorption peaks,
so we can extrapolate the areas to the actual amount we have of each
active substance in the preparation. Since the chemical nature of
all the three actives is very similar, it is actually very tricky
to elucidate the compounds in separated peaks and avoid them to overlap.
Additionally, both coenzyme Q10 and vitamin C absorb at a wavelength
of 275 nm, and all the three substances absorb at 200 nm wavelength
as well, thus making it absolutely necessary to develop a methodology
to separate the peaks for its quantification. With combinations of
the actives in separate, just one article of simultaneous analysis
has been published, reported by Temova-Rakuša et al.,14 with the coanalysis of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin
C. This article provides an interesting method for their quantification
but not valid for the analysis of phosphatidylserine. In the Supporting
Information (Figure S1), we attach a chromatogram
of this reported method with our three active substances, where any
absorption peak can be observed for our third active substance, the
phosphatidylserine, meaning that it is not a suitable analytical method
for this substance or for the simultaneous quantification of the three
active substances. Therefore, our method could be considered as a
unique and interesting contribution with applications in pharmaceutical/cosmetic/food
industry.

After the design and development of the method, a
complete validation
study was meticulously accomplished following the ICH quality guidelines.
It was also used and proved in different real circumstances such as
long-term stability studies at different conditions.

Results and Discussion
Sample
Preparation Strategy
After some assays, results
demonstrated that it is necessary to remove the water from the samples
to allow the elution of substances at the chromatogram and to successfully
analyze and quantify the peaks of the active substances. First, with
any water in the sample, it was almost impossible to correctly solve
all the lipids. Second, being hydrophobic active substances with water,
the peaks were not eluting in a satisfactory peak form or were not
eluting at all. Freeze-drying of samples was carried out. Afterwards,
twenty different lyophilized vials with the liposomal formulation
were injected and analyzed with the developed HPLC method to test
the accuracy of the sample preparation strategy, and the RSD after
the analyses of the all the vials was 2.35% for CoQ10, 2.14% for vitamin
C, and 2.74% for PS, thus showing optimal results of repeatability.

Method Development
The designed HPLC method was meant
to properly analyze the content of CoQ10, vitamin C, and PS from a
liposomal formulation. First, we assayed different mixtures and proportions
between methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, and water buffer. To
choose an adequate buffer, we looked out to the pKa of the three substances and selected buffer at a pH
where all compounds would be in an undissociated form, such as 0.02
M NH4AcO at pH = 6.5. Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of every active
substance, while its corresponding pKa, partition coefficient, and molecular weight are shown in Table 1. The first chromatographic
meticulously tested conditions showed us that for a favorable elution
of CoQ10, a 100% flow of pure methanol or isopropanol is needed, and
any mixture with water made its elution impossible with an optimal
peak shape. On the other hand, for the analysis of vitamin C, a mixture
of organic solvent and water was needed for its proper elution, and
PS was not eluted in any isocratic condition with an optimal peak
shape, considering theoretical plate numbers (N)
and USP tailing factor.

At this point of development, a gradient of NH4AcO buffer
with isopropanol was extensively investigated at different proportions
and with different gradient duration times until we found an adequate
combination that allowed the optimal elution of all the compounds
during the same analysis. An example of the obtained chromatogram
after last optimization is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Chromatographic exemplification of the developed
method with the
three analyzed active substances. The peak with an RT of 12.754 min
corresponds to vitamin C, an RT of 14.892 min corresponds to PS, and
an RT of 17.714 corresponds to CoQ10. The red line is λ = 275
nm, while the blue line is λ = 200 nm.

Method Validation
Before carrying through the validation
assays, the suitability of the equipment with the method was tested. Table 2 shows RSD of retention
times (RT), symmetry of the peak, USP tailing factor, capacity factor,
and N, demonstrating consistency and appropriateness.
The tabulated retention times of the six analyzed samples and symmetry
analyses on each peak of the active substances can be found in the
Supporting Information (Scheme S2 and Figures S3–S5).

Equipment and Data

capacity factor	3.08	2.49	3.85	
plate numbers (N)	40,891	33,327	67,904	
After checking the suitability of the equipment
and before starting
any other validation step, it was necessary to understand for how
long samples are stable above at least 95% of all active substances.
It was determined that, to accomplish this requirement, liposomal
samples could be injected up to 3 h after its preparation in the HPLC
vials without significant degradation of any sample, while for the
standard solution, the time was shortened to 1 h. So, it is highly
recommended to analyze samples right after its solubilization in organic
solvents and preparation for HPLC quantification.

The precision
of the system was also checked before any other validation
step. After five consecutive injections of a 100% concentration of
PS, the area scattered only in a 0.59%, being inside our acceptance
criteria of ≤1.0%, thus confirming its reliability (see the Supporting Information).

Selectivity was
confirmed by overlapping the chromatograms of an
analyzed sample with a standard solution and a third one with the
rest of the substances (Figure 3). Additionally, the purity factor of peaks was studied. In
all cases, purity was above the threshold limit, set at 990.000 (see
the Supporting Information, Table S6 and FiguresS7 and S8).

Through analyzing all seven concentrations between
130 and 70%
of the standard solution, results demonstrated an adequate linearity
in this concentration range. Data is summarized on Table 3, with RSD and correlation coefficients
accomplishing our established limits. Table 3 also shows data regarding precision and
accuracy.

and Accuracy during the Validation of the Method

For the precision of the method evaluated in different
days, we
established a 2.8% RSD and a 3.7% for repeatability (intra-laboratory).
Regarding accuracy, every recovery percentage after the study was
included in our quality specifications. All this data demonstrated
excellent results with respect to the validation of the method and
indicated that this method is precise and accurate.

Table 4 details
the percentage of recovery on the nine analyses at different concentrations
for evaluating accuracy. Every concentration resulted in less than
a 2% RSD, and ANOVA test showed nonsignificant differences on any
active substance at any concentration.

ANOVA test (p-value)	0.98	0.67	0.88	
Lastly, robustness studies revealed that the method
must be controlled
in terms of temperature, injection volume, wavelength detection, and
flow since otherwise results could slightly variate. Being a method
with three analyzed compounds, each parameter resulted in some degree
of retention time differences or peak areas.

Table 5 indicates which
parameter showed significant or nonsignificant differences after deliberated
changes upon its analysis with a one-way ANOVA test. On this table,
although significant differences were shown in many of the deliberated
changes, RSD values were not in any case over 5% but with wavelength
for PS. Since λ = 200 nm is a wavelength where also solvents
have certain absorbance, it is a critical parameter to be controlled.
Specifically, a two-tailed T-student test was carried out to compare
wavelengths 197 nm versus 200 nm and 200 nm versus 203 nm. The first
T-test contained highly significant differences with a p–value of >0.01, but nonsignificant differences were observed
with a p–value of 0.80 between 200 and 203
nm, thus being 203 nm also a suitable wavelength to be used.

Based on the standard deviation of the response and the slope,

Applications
of the Method
Once validated, the proposed
method was used to accurately evaluate the stability of the three
active substances encapsulated on the mentioned liposomal formula
after 3 months of storage at 4 and 25 °C. This study verifies
the applicability of the method in a real case study. Results are
presented in Table 7, while an illustrative chromatogram of each temperature is included
in the Supporting Information (Figures S9 and S10).

Conclusions
The
developed method demonstrated promising results on the simultaneous
analyses of CoQ10, vitamin C, and PS. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first reported method for the determination of these widely
used active substances at the same time. Thus, this method could result
in an ideal analytic method for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and
food supplement industry.

Additionally, the formulation involving
the liposomal technology
may be a tricky challenge to allow a correct quantification and analyses,
especially for very lipophilic active substances to which the presence
of water can signify a complicated limitation for the analyses. The
performed methodology of sample treatment prior to its analyses may
be as well an additional step of valuable interest. The concept may
be applied to any other possible liposomal formulations with highly
hydrophobic active substances.

In terms of validation of the
method, following the ICH guidelines,
the suitability of the equipment, selectivity of the method, linearity,
robustness, precision, accuracy, and stability of the solution during
the analyses were tested with positive and encouraging results.

Lastly, with the purpose of verifying the applicability of the
method, a testing of the method with a real case was carried out.
Samples subjected to stability studies were analyzed, and results
were studied and interpreted, with excellent results.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Chemical Reagents
6-O-Palmitoyl-l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C; analytical standard,
≥99.0%), cholesterol-(polyethylene glycol-600) (Chol-PEG),
and cholesterol (Chol) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt,
Germany). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine sodium salt (phosphatidylserine or PS; analytical standard,
≥99.0%) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(phosphatidylcholine or PC) were purchased from Lipoid GmbH (Switzerland).
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10; United States Pharmacopeia (USP) reference standard
quality, ≥99.0%) was obtained from Vitae Health Innovation
S.L (Spain). Ammonium acetate (NH4AcO) was acquired from
Panreac Quimica (Barcelona, Spain).

Instrumentation
Analyses were carried out with an HPLC
system model 1100 HP from Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
EEUU), composed of a quaternary pump, an automatic injector, a diode
array detector, and a column oven where our column was placed, all
controlled by a ChemStation software version B04.02. For the freeze-drying
of samples, a Telstar Cryodos–50 lyophilizator was used.

Preparation of Liposomes
Liposomal formulations were
prepared using the thin-film hydration method with some modifications.18 Briefly, PC, PS, Chol, Chol-PEG, and CoQ10 were
dissolved in chloroform solutions (100 mg/mL) or chloroform/ethanol
7:3 for vitamin C and mixed afterward at the desired molar. In this
case, the molar concentration was 79 mM, with 30.4% PS, 22.8% PC,
19.0% Chol, 15.3% vitamin C, 8.8% CoQ10, and 3.8% Chol-PEG. The organic
solvent was removed under vacuum and nitrogen to afford a dry lipid
film, which was hydrated with an aqueous solution under vigorous stirring
for 15 min at 40 °C. Under these conditions, the stacks of liquid
crystalline lipid bilayers become fluid and swell, resulting in their
detachment during agitation and their self-closure to form multilamellar
large vesicles (MLVs). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were obtained
by homogenizing the MLV suspension using an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes,
Canada) and a polycarbonate membrane (pore size, 200 nm).

Sample Preparation
Strategy
The treatment and preparation
of samples prior to HPLC analyses were essential for allowing the
quantification of the lipidic active substances. Liposomal formulations
have by definition the characteristic of including both water and
water-insoluble compounds, and this could make any posterior analyses
difficult. Since the presence of water is a very unfavorable condition
to dissolve and allow the flow of the substances through the column
in an appropriate way, a procedure of analysis including the lyophilization
of the samples was carried out: an scheme illustrating the preparation
process of the samples can be found in the Supporting Information
(Scheme S2). For the lyophilization of samples, 1 mL of the
liposomal solution was pipetted on each vial and frozen afterward
at −80 °C on an ultralow temperature freezer for 12 h.
Once samples were completely frozen, they were freeze-dried for 4
days. Lyophilization conditions of pressure and temperature were 1
mbar and −50 °C, respectively.

Once samples were
completely dried, 2 mL of CHCl3 was added to properly solubilize
the very apolar active substances: PS, vitamin C, and CoQ10. After
5 min of slight shaking and only when the sample was completely dissolved,
10 mL of methanol was added, and the final solution was transferred
into 25 mL volumetric flasks. The vials were afterward cleaned with
methanol, which was also transferred to the flasks, making up to 25
mL with more methanol. Lastly, all solutions were filtered with 0.45
μm PVDF filters, and HPLC vials were prepared. The final concentration
of each active compound at the moment of injection to the HPLC system
was 776 μg mL–1 PS, 240 μg
mL–1 CoQ10, and 200 μg mL–1 vitamin C.

To validate the preparation
procedure developed, 20 lyophilized
vials were injected, establishing an RSD limit of 2.7%.

Standard Solution
Preparation
For the preparation of
a standard solution, 19.4 mg of PS, 6 mg of CoQ10, and 5 mg of vitamin
C were accurately weighed and dissolved in the same way than in the
sample preparation procedure, so the final peak areas would be also
the same both in standard solutions and sample solutions.

Chromatographic
Conditions
For HPLC analyses, the employed
column was a C18 Zorbax Eclipse Plus 2.1 × 150 mm (5 μm),
with a constant flow of 0.25 mL min–1 and a controlled temperature of 25 °C. The injection volume
was 10 μL, and the detection wavelengths were λ = 275
nm for vitamin C and CoQ10 andλ = 200 nm for PS since no other
absorbance was found after checking with the diode array accessory.
After 19 min, all the compounds were already eluted, but the stop
time was fixed at 28 min to return to the initial conditions and stabilize
the equipment. The detailed proportions of the two employed solvents
during the time are shown in Table 8.

Table 8 Detailed Gradient of the Developed
Method

5	60	40	
10	0	100	
18	0	100

28	60	40	
A gradient method was developed and is detailed in Table 8. Solvent A in the
table is
isopropanol, while Solvent B is a buffer solution of 0.02 M NH4AcO.

Method Validation
The development
of the method was
followed by validation studies to ensure selectivity, linearity, robustness,
precision, stability of the solution during the analyses, and accuracy
of the method, following the ICH guidelines.19 Prior to any validation test, six injections of a standard solution
were analyzed to ensure the suitability of the equipment. Retention
times with less than 1.0% variations, capacity numbers greater than
2, and symmetry of peaks between 0.7 and 1.2, theoretical plate numbers
(N) above 2000 for any peak, and USP tailing factor
smaller than 1.5 were checked out.

Selectivity is the ability
to assess unequivocally the analyte in the presence of other components,
which may be expected to be present. For this study, both sample and
standard solutions were compared, thus confirming the complete separation
of all compounds with a purity peak test being carried out for each
active substance. Linearity was tested by preparing seven different
concentrations per triplicate between 70 and 30% of the standard solution
at the usual working concentration, studying if the response is directly
proportional within this range. Response factor (RF) was the analyzed
parameter on linearity, being the result of dividing peak areas by
the corresponding concentration. Precision is the parameter that expresses
the degree of scatter between a series of measures. In this case,
the precision of the method and system was evaluated with the injection
of nine standard solutions at different concentrations and with different
analysts and different days of work, studying its repeatability. Robustness
is a measure of the capacity to remain unaffected by small but deliberated
variations in method parameters such as the temperature of the column
(± 3 °C), the analyzed wavelength (± 3 nm), the injection
volume (± 5 μL), or modifications in the flow level of
the pump (± 0.05 mL/min). This study is necessary to understand
the importance of controlling a determinate parameter. Stability of
the active substances in the HPLC vials once prepared is also vital
to understand for how long the solution is stable before injecting.
Lastly, the accuracy of the method was assessed to verify if any of
the lipids of the liposome affect the analyses of the active substances.
To this end, three standard solutions and the other lipids were prepared
at 130, 100, and 70% of the usual working concentration, and real
concentrations were compared with the theoretical ones. According
to the American Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC20), the limits for the RSD (coefficient of variation)
are established in consonance with the concentration of the analyte
in the sample, so it established a limit for the active substances
of 2.7% RSD.
