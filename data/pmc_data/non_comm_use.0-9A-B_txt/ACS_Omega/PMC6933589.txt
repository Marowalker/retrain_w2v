Intermetallic compounds have attracted research attention
in catalysis
because of their unique catalytic properties. Recently, a group of
intermetallic compounds, referred to as Heusler alloys (X2YZ), has been investigated as new catalysts. In this study, catalytic
properties of 14 Heusler alloys with X = Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu; Y = Ti,
Mn, or Fe; Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, or Sn for the steam reforming of methanol
were examined. Co2TiAl and Ni2TiAl alloys exhibited
relatively high H2 production rates because of the formation
of fine particles via the selective oxidation of Ti. X2MnZ alloys exhibited high CO2 selectivity because of a
water-gas shift reaction catalyzed by using MnO that was formed during
the reaction. Crystal phases, surface microstructures, and surface
compositions of most alloys were changed because of the reaction,
and the formation of fine particles possibly assisted in the observation
of catalytic activity. Heusler alloys can be beneficial as catalyst
precursors by the selection of appropriate elemental sets depending
on target reactions.

1 Introduction
Intermetallic compounds
exhibit unique atomic ordered structures
and electronic structures, even at the surface, rendering unique catalytic
properties. Currently, they are gaining increasing popularity as new
catalysts.1−3 Almost all of the reported intermetallic catalysts
are binary systems. However, ternary intermetallic compounds can render
synergistic effects among three elements, which serve as novel catalysts
different from ordinary binary catalysts. Heusler alloys (X2YZ) constitute a group of ternary intermetallic compounds with an
L21 structure (other types are also present).4 Typically, the main element X belongs to groups
8–12, while subelements Y and Z belong to groups 3–8
and 13–15, respectively, which is similar to most of the intermetallic
catalysts reported thus far. Various possible elemental sets of X,
Y, and Z can afford new catalysts, and catalysis can be tuned by utilizing
in-between compositions (e.g., X2YZ0.5Z0.5′). However,
Heusler alloys have not been identified as catalysts until only recently.
Typically, catalysts are prepared by a liquid process in a form of
supported nanoparticles, which requires considerable trials and errors
to establish preparation conditions for each elemental system. This
fact makes it difficult to screen ternary intermetallic compounds,
including Heusler alloys, as catalysts.

Most of the stable intermetallic
compounds, even in ternary (or
higher) systems, can be easily prepared by metallurgical methods such
as arc-melting. By this method, Heusler catalysts in a form of unsupported
powders have been screened by our group.4−6 Previously, the oxidation
of carbon monoxide over Heusler catalysts revealed that X mainly exhibits
catalytic activity and Y and Z modulate the activity and durability.5 Our group has also investigated the selective
hydrogenation of alkynes and reported that unlike practical Pd-based
catalysts, non-noble metal catalysts such as Co2(Mn or
Fe)Ge exhibit high alkene selectivity, and catalysis can be systematically controlled
by elemental substitution (Co2MnxFe1–xGayGe1–y).6

It would be desirable and beneficial to screen these
emerging ternary
intermetallic catalysts for other reactions to develop new catalysts
and gain fundamental knowledge. Hence, the steam reforming of methanol
(SRM) is conducted herein, for which intermetallic catalysts are typically
applied.1−3,7−11 The reaction CH3OH + H2O → 3H2 + CO2 is one possibility for producing hydrogen from
safe storage for use as a clean energy source in society.12,13 The catalytic properties of 14 Heusler alloys with X = Fe, Co, Ni,
or Cu; Y = Ti, Mn, or Fe; Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, or Sn, which were easily
prepared equilibrium phases, and structural changes occurring during
the reaction were examined in this report.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SRM with the Reactant CH3OH/H2O = 2:3
Figure 1 shows production rates of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 for the SRM with the reactant CH3OH/H2O = 2:3 during heating and cooling processes.
For Co2TiAl (Figure 1a), the H2 production rate started to significantly
increase at 500 °C with the heating, but it decreased at 600
°C. A higher H2 rate was observed during cooling than
during heating. Similarly, for Ni2TiAl, the H2 rate suddenly started to increase at 450 °C. Furthermore, the
H2 production rate at ≤400 °C was greater during
cooling than during heating. Studies reported that Ni3Al
and Ni3(Si,Ti) form Ni fine particles on the surface because
of the selective oxidation of Al and Si, respectively, during methanol
decomposition, thereby exhibiting high activity.14−16 Similarly,
after SRM, Ni2TiAl exhibited Ni fine particles, as can
be observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analyses (Figure 2a,b, respectively); these fine particles were probably formed because
of the selective oxidation of Ti as revealed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis summarized in Table 1. The increased H2 production
rate at ≥450 °C and the higher H2 production
rate at 400 °C during cooling than during heating were attributed
to the Ni fine particle formation. SEM images of Co2TiAl
after SRM mainly revealed a number of carbon nanofibers (CNF) with
fine particles, while occasionally observed fine particles on the
surface (Figure 2b).
The crystal structure and composition of these fine particles were
not observed by XRD (Figure 2a) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analyses.
However, the fine particles in Figure 2b (region 2) were probably Co precipitated via the
selective oxidation of Ti; this precipitated Co could serve as active
centers, which produced an increased amount of H2 during
cooling than during heating. This mechanism was deduced from Table 1 and the subsequent
experiments discussed in the next section.

μm. Each data point was obtained after maintaining constant
for 30 min at each reaction temperature.

The decrease in the H2 production rate
at 600 °C
for Co2TiAl was mainly related to the decrease in the methanol
feeding because of the blocking of the extensive growth of CNF (Figure 2b, region 1). Compared
to Ni2TiAl, Co2TiAl exhibited a larger number
of CNF, as indicated by the SEM images and by the higher surface area
of Co2TiAl (3.26 m2 g–1) than
that of Ni2TiAl (0.32 m2 g–1) after the reaction. Compared to Co2TiAl, Ni2TiAl exhibited a smaller decrease in methanol feeding (Figure 2c); therefore, the smaller
H2 production rate at 500 °C in the cooling phase
than in the heating phase for Ni2TiAl (Figure 1b) is related to the coarsening
of Ni particles at ≥550 °C and not to the decrease in
methanol feeding. Besides H2, CO was the main product over
these alloys, which was typical for pure Co and Ni.13 Thus, H2 is predominantly produced by methanol
decomposition (CH3OH → 2H2 + CO), and
most of the methanol is consumed at ≥550 °C for both alloys
as the H2 rates almost reach their ideal maximum values
(assuming decomposition) (Figure 2c). The increase in the CO2 production rate
at high temperatures confirms the growth of CNF via the disproportionation
of CO (2CO → CO2 + C).

Conversely, Cu2TiAl did not catalyze the reaction (Figure 1c). SEM images revealed
homogeneously precipitated fine particles (Figure 3). However, XPS analysis revealed a very
small surface composition of Cu (Table 1), indicating that active fine particles are not formed
by selective oxidation. Co and Ni exhibited similar Gibbs energies
of oxidation, but Cu exhibited a considerably more positive Gibbs
energy (Table 2).17 Fine particle formation by selective oxidation
possibly depended on a balance of component oxidizability; thus, Cu
is probably difficult to precipitate on the surface of alloy with
Ti and Al.

CH3OH/H2O = 2:3.

In case of X2TiSn, Fe2TiSn exhibited
extremely
low activity (Figure 1d) and formed several phases after the reaction (Figure 4a). Co2TiSn and
Ni2TiSn basically exhibited similar production rates although
Ni2TiSn was slightly active compared to Co2TiSn
(Figure 1e,f). In addition,
Co2TiSn and Ni2TiSn exhibited similar structural
changes, affording marginal X3Sn2 (Figure 4a), as well as similar
SEM images revealing fine particles (Figure 4b) after the reaction. EDX analysis indicated
that their alloy compositions are stoichiometric in most areas after
the reaction. Similar to X2TiAl, oxidizability (Fe >
Co
≅ Ni; Table 2) likely played a role in the structural change through the reaction,
consequently dominating the catalytic properties.

Similar to X2TiSn, Co2MnSn
and Ni2MnSn exhibited similar catalytic properties (Figure 1g,h). In addition,
these alloys exhibited
similar structural changes, affording marginal X3Sn2 and MnO (Figure 5a). SEM images after the reaction revealed fine particles
in some parts of Co2MnSn and all parts of Ni2MnSn (Figure 5b).
Even in the case of X2MnSn, X = Co and Ni exhibited similar
results, as well as for X2TiAl and X2TiSn. However,
Co2MnSn and Ni2MnSn mainly produced CO2 besides H2, unlike (Co or Ni)2TiAl and (Co
or Ni)2TiSn. In addition, the main byproduct of Co2MnGe, Co2MnGa, and Co2MnSi was CO2 (Figure 1i–k).
All these Mn-containing alloys formed MnO during the reaction (Figure 6a). Especially, in
Co2MnGe, strong XRD peaks for MnO were observed, and the
formation of MnO fine structures on the surface was observed by SEM,
EDX (Figure 6b), and
XPS analyses (Table 1). MnO catalyzes the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2).18−20 Thus, MnO most
likely catalyzed the reaction between H2O and CO produced
by methanol decomposition in the Mn-containing alloys. The water-gas
shift reaction is less favorable at higher temperature.21 Actually, the CO2 selectivity (molar
ratio of CO2 in all byproducts) decreased with the increase
in the temperature for Mn-containing alloys (Table 3), supporting the proposed mechanism.

Co2TiGe did not catalyze the reaction (Figure 1l). Fine particle
formation
was not observed by SEM (Figure 7b). Only this alloy clearly exhibited TiO2 peaks in the XRD pattern (Figure 7a). The surface Ti composition was considerably greater
than the stoichiometry even before the reaction (Table 1). These facts indicated that
active sites are not formed on the surface covered by inert TiO2.

asterisks represent Co2TiGe peaks, “CoGe?”
peaks were likely CoGe with the C2/m space group, and the “Un” peak was unknown, but possibly
hcp-Co.

Co2FeGe exhibited an unusual change
in the H2 production rate: it increased with heating but
decreased at 550
°C (Figure 1m).
SEM revealed fine particles with diameters of ∼400 nm (Figure 8a: region 1), and
grains with diameters less than 100 nm are apparently precursors of
the 400 nm particles (Figure 8a: region 2). The precipitation of small grains possibly increased
the H2 production rate at 450 °C. XRD and XPS analyses
revealed that most of the surfaces are covered by Fe3O4 (Figure 8b
and Table 1). Thus,
the coarsening of the grains and the formation of Fe3O4 possibly decrease the H2 production rate at 550
°C.

pattern of Co2FeGe after SRM with the reactant of CH3OH/H2O = 2:3. In (b), asterisks and “FO”
represent peaks of Co2FeGe and Fe3O4 with the Fd3̅m space group,
respectively.

All of the alloy powders changed their colors after
the catalytic
reaction, but the metallic gray color of Co2FeGa did not
change, although the color of the bottommost region (ca. 10 vol %)
of the catalyst bed changed to black. XRD (Figure 9a), SEM, and EDX results did not reveal changes
in structures and compositions of the metallic gray powders during
the reaction, except for the presence of minute CNFs in some areas
of SEM images (Figure 9b). However, XPS analysis revealed that most of the surfaces are
covered by Ga oxides (Table 1). Although studies on the SRM and methanol decomposition
over Ga oxides at high temperatures of greater than 500 °C have
not been reported, studies revealed that Ga oxides strongly interact
with methanol molecules at a lower temperature.22 Thus, the H2 production over Co2FeGa
is likely related to the presence of surface Ga oxides. The SEM image
of the bottommost black powders revealed a significant growth of CNF
(Figure 9b). As these
black powders were obtained at the bottommost region and the H2 production rate only exhibited a marginal difference between
the heating and cooling processes, the fine particles on CNFs did
not contribute to the H2 production.

(b) SEM images of Co2FeGa powders

CH3OH/H2O = 2:3. In (a), asterisks represent
Co2FeGa peaks.

2.2 Further Investigation on Co2TiAl,
Ni2TiAl, Co2FeGe, and Co2FeGa
Co2TiAl and Ni2TiAl apparently exhibited high
activity for methanol decomposition, which corresponded to the first
step of SRM, because of the fine particle formation. Pure Co and Ni
powders sieved to 20–63 μm exhibited low activity (Figure 10), possibly related
to the large particle size for methanol decomposition that is structure-sensitive.23 To validate the importance of fine particle
formation, effects of steam and oxygen were investigated. Figure 11 shows the results
of methanol decomposition using CH3OH as the reactant without
H2O, the SRM using CH3OH/H2O = 2:1
as the reactant, and the SRM using CH3OH/H2O
= 2:3 as the reactant after the oxygen pretreatment at 500 °C.
For Co2TiAl, a H2 production rate for 2:1 SRM
was greater than that for methanol decomposition (Figure 11a,b), but it was less than
that for 2:3 SRM (Figure 1a), indicating that active fine particles are formed via oxidation
by H2O. The highest H2 production rate was observed
for 2:3 SRM after the oxygen pretreatment (Figure 11c), indicating that fine particle formation
is considerably enhanced by O2 instead of H2O. Ni2TiAl exhibited a similar tendency with Co2TiAl (Figure 11d–f),
although similar results were obtained for 2:1 and 2:3 SRM reactions
(Figures 11e and 1b).

Figure 10 Production rates of H2, CO, CO2,
and CH4 in SRM with the reactant of CH3OH/H2O = 2:3 during heating and cooling processes for (a) pure
Co (RARE
METALLIC, 99.9%, −100 mesh) and (b) pure Ni (RARE METALLIC,
99.9%, −200 mesh) powders sieved to 20–63 μm.
Circles, triangles, squares, and crosses represent H2,
CO, CO2, and CH4, respectively. LHSV was 20
h–1. Each data point was obtained after remaining
constant for 30 min at each reaction temperature.

and CH4 for (a–c) Co2TiAl and (d–f)
Ni2TiAl in (a,d) methanol decomposition, (b,e) SRM with
the reactant
of CH3OH/H2O = 2:1, and (c,f) SRM with the reactant
of CH3OH/H2O = 2:3 after oxygen pretreatment
during heating and cooling processes. Circles, triangles, squares,
and crosses represent H2, CO, CO2, and CH4, respectively. LHSV of methanol was 13 h–1 in all three reactions, which corresponded to the methanol part
of LHSV (20 h–1) for CH3OH/H2O = 2:3. Each data point was obtained after remaining constant for
30 min at each reaction temperature.

Figure 12 shows
SEM images after these reactions. Co2TiAl exhibited significant
CNF growth in all reactions, where almost all areas were covered by
CNF in case of the methanol decomposition and 2:1 SRM. In case of
the surface after oxygen-pretreated SRM, fine particle formation was
occasionally observed, which was likely enhanced by O2 pretreatment
(Figure 12d), although
the structure of fine particles was not observed by XRD analysis (Figure 13a). As indicated
by SEM and XPS analyses, significant CNF growth likely increased in
the order of methanol decomposition >2:1 SRM >2:3 SRM without
and
with oxygen pretreatment (Table 1), but the H2 production rate followed the
reverse order. Thus, the active centers of Co2TiAl are
likely fine particles formed by the selective oxidation of Ti, not
the fine particles on CNF. For Ni2TiAl, only methanol decomposition
afforded an excess growth of CNF (Figure 12e). After 2:1 and 2:3 SRM, similar surfaces
(Figures 12f and 2b) as well as catalytic properties (Figures 11e and 1b) were observed. After oxygen-pretreated SRM, the surface clearly
exhibited large numbers of fine particles (Figure 12g), which was verified by XRD analysis,
with the strongest intensity peaks observed for Ni in the series (Figure 13b). The H2 production rate clearly depended on the number of fine particles,
indicating that the active centers are fine particles formed by the
selective oxidation of Ti as well as in Co2TiAl. Note that
the topmost region (ca. 20 vol %) of the catalyst bed changed the
color to black after SRM with oxygen pretreatment and revealed significant
CNF growth (Figure 12h, Table 1). However,
our conclusion was not altered as CNFs were apparently not grown at
400 °C during heating, while a higher H2 production
rate was observed during heating than during cooling at this temperature.
Jang et al. reported that the activation of Ni3Al catalysts
by the selective oxidation of Al is enhanced by the addition of some
steam (CH3OH/H2O = 10:1) in methanol decomposition,
but it is significantly suppressed by the addition of more steam (CH3OH/H2O = 2:1 and 1:1).24 The activation of Ni2TiAl was more enhanced by the addition
of more steam and using more severe oxidant (O2). As Ni
fine particle formation required the selective oxidation of Ti in
the presence of Al, more severe oxidation conditions were likely preferred.

regions are shown for (c,d) Co2TiAl, and observations of

respectively, were separately conducted.

of the less black powders (green line) and black powders (yellow line)
at the bottom and topmost regions of catalyst bed, respectively, were
separately conducted. Asterisks represent Co2TiAl and Ni2TiAl peaks.

In terms of application, the activity of oxygen-pretreated
Ni2TiAl is herein compared to those of reported catalysts.
The
turnover frequency (TOF) is often evaluated to compare the activity.
TOF values have been reported for many transition-metal-supported
catalysts, however, strongly depending on surface areas and dispersion
of metals.25,26 Thus, activities cannot be compared
by TOF between supported small catalysts and our unsupported large
catalysts. A H2 production rate per catalyst weight is
crucial for applications. Supported Cu catalysts exhibited H2 production rates of ∼200 μmol g–1 s–1 at ∼250 °C and ∼300 μmol
g–1 s–1 at ∼300 °C.13,27 In our previous study, Raney Pd exhibit a H2 production
rate of 87 μmol g–1 s–1 at
300 °C.28 However, herein, Ni2TiAl exhibited a H2 production rate of 8.6 μmol
g–1 s–1 at 300 °C. Considering
that the size of Ni fine particles was up to 400 nm and that their
precursors were powders sieved to 20–63 μm, a considerably
higher H2 production rate is expected by using, for example,
precursor powders with a diameter of ∼2 μm or foils with
a thickness of ∼2 μm.

Co2FeGe and Co2FeGa exhibited relatively
high H2 production rates for 2:3 SRM (Figure 1m,n). As the main byproduct
was CO, H2 was supposedly produced by methanol decomposition.
Actually, these catalysts were active for the methanol decomposition
without steam (Figure 14). For Co2FeGe, rather than fine particle formation, only
surface roughening was observed in the SEM images (Figure 15a). XPS analysis indicated that the chemical composition
among metals is not changed (Table 1). As H2 was produced in the low-temperature
region of ≤400 °C, metallic Co2FeGe was considered
to be active for methanol decomposition. Lower H2 production
rates observed at ≤400 and ≥550 °C for 2:3 SRM
than those for methanol decomposition (Figures 1m and 14a) were likely
related to the oxidation by H2O at ≤400 °C
and to the significant formation of Fe3O4 at
≥550 °C. Metallic Co2FeGe with a diameter of
20–63 μm was active for the structure-sensitive reaction
possibly due to the specific electronic structure or a specific reaction
field constructed by atomic ordered structures. For Co2FeGa, the H2 production rate was slightly less for the
methanol decomposition than that for 2:3 SRM. SEM only revealed surface
roughening, not fine particle formation (Figure 15b). XPS analysis revealed an increase in
the composition of Ga among metals (Table 1). However, it was less significant than
that observed for 2:3 SRM. Thus, Ga oxides are considered to play
a key role in catalysis of methanol decomposition. By the comparison
of all results, secondary phases that might be FeO for Co2FeGe and Co2C for Co2FeGa (Figure 15c) were not likely to contribute
to the methanol decomposition without steam.

3 Methods
Heusler alloy ingots were prepared
by arc-melting and subsequent
annealing, the conditions of which were described previously.5,6 First, the ingots were crushed using a mortar and pestle. Second,
the obtained powders were sieved to 20–63 μm for catalytic
measurements. The alloys were (almost) a single phase with a highly
ordered L21 Heusler structure,5,6 which
was examined by XRD for powders with a size of less than 20 μm
post-annealed at 600 °C for removing strains.

A catalytic
reaction was conducted in the gas phase using a fixed-bed
flow reactor. A powder catalyst was held on quartz wool fixed in a
quartz tube with an internal diameter of ∼7.5 mm. Considering
formula weights, catalyst amounts were 0.60, 0.75, and 0.90 g for
alloys with Z = Al, Si; Z = Ga, Ge; Z = Sn, respectively, so that
the catalyst layer height was ∼5 mm. The catalyst was preheated
at 600 °C for 1 h under H2 flow for removing surface
oxides and strains introduced because of crushing. A reactant mixture
of CH3OH and H2O with a molar ratio of 2:3 was
fed using a plunger pump at a constant rate of 0.1 mL min–1, where the actual measured rate was typically 0.07 g min–1 corresponding to 0.08 mL min–1 and a liquid hourly
space velocity (LHSV) of ∼20 h–1. In addition
to the reactant, 30 mL min–1 of N2 carrier
gas was introduced during the reaction. The reaction temperature was
controlled using an electric furnace surrounding the reactor. Gaseous
products (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) were
analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC 14A).29 Their production rates were estimated from the analyzed
concentrations and downstream flow rate measured at room temperature
using a flow meter. These analyses were performed 30 min after achieving
the measurement temperatures from every 50 °C from 300 °C
when heating up to 600 °C and every 100 °C when cooling
down to 300 °C.

For selected samples, the effect of steam
was investigated by the
SRM using the reactant CH3OH/H2O = 2:1 and 1:0
(methanol decomposition), with a methanol feeding rate of 0.04 g min–1, corresponding to that in the SRM with the reactant
CH3OH/H2O = 2:3. In addition, the effect of
oxygen pretreatment was investigated by the addition of a heating
process at 500 °C for 1 h under a 100 mL min–1 flow of [1% O2/He balance] gas before the reaction.

The surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method with Kr adsorption (BELSORP-max volumetric adsorption
instrument, MicrotracBEL); the BET surface area was 0.05–0.13
m2 g–1 before the reaction, mainly depending
on formula weights.5,6 Structural changes occurring because
of the reaction were examined by XRD (Ultima IV diffractometer, Rigaku),
SEM (field-emission type, SU6600, Hitachi) equipped with EDX (INCA
x-act, Oxford Instruments), and XPS (PHI 5600, ULVAC-PHI).

4 Conclusions
Fourteen Heusler alloy
catalysts were examined for SRM. Depending
on elemental sets, various catalytic properties were observed because
of structural changes occurring during the reaction; these structural
changes apparently depended on a balance of component oxidizability.
The H2 production rates over Co2TiAl and Ni2TiAl significantly increased because of the formation of fine
particles via the selective oxidation of Ti during the reaction, although
most of H2 was produced by methanol decomposition. H2 production was enhanced by oxygen pretreatment, promoting
fine particle formation. All of the Mn-containing alloys formed MnO,
which catalyzed the water-gas shift reaction and produced CO2 from CO generated by methanol decomposition. Co2FeGa
apparently exhibited activity for methanol decomposition because of
the formation of Ga oxides. By choosing appropriate elemental sets,
Heusler alloys can be good precursors of catalysts that exhibit high
activity and desirable selectivity. On the other hand, Co2FeGe apparently catalyzed methanol decomposition in the initial metallic
states, possibly related to its unique electronic structure or a unique
atomic ordered reaction field.
