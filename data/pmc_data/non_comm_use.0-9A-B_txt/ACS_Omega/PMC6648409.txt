A new type of ternary hybrid, Pd@MCM-Calixox, based
on mesoporous silica, calixarene conjugate, and Pd(0) nanoparticles
(NPs) was synthesized by sacrificial oxidation of allylic calixarene
conjugate eventually functionalized with mesoporous silica without
using any external reducing agent. The role of the calix conjugate
in the formation of Pd@MCM-Calixox has been established.
The hybrid, Pd@MCM-Calixox, was characterized by different
techniques to support the formation of well-dispersed Pd(0) NPs of
12 ± 2 nm size. The catalyst, Pd@MCM-Calixox, has
been proven to be a resourceful one in water in three different types
of reactions, namely, Suzuki C–C cross coupling, reduction
of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nitroaromatic compounds, and reduction
and degradation of cationic, anionic, and neutral organic dyes. The
catalyst exhibited higher turnover frequencies for all these transformations
even when a very low concentration of Pd-based catalyst was used.
The Pd@MCM-Calixox hybrid catalyst can be recycled several
times without experiencing any significant loss in the activity. Also,
the regenerated catalyst showed retention of well-spread Pd(0) species
even after several catalytic cycles. The tetraallyl calixarene, allylCalix,
conjugate acts as a reducing agent, also controls the size, and yields
the well-dispersed Pd(0) NPs. The calix conjugate further provides
a hydrophobic core in assisting the diffusion of hydrophobic substrates
toward catalytic sites.

Introduction
Over the past few decades,
the nanoparticles (NPs) of noble metals
have been noticed to involve richly in the field of organic transformations.1 Owning to their unique structures and high activity,
the development of Pd NPs is of great advantage. Despite wide utility
of Pd-based catalysts in organic synthesis, a major setback has been
the leaching out of Pd and its nonseparability from the product at
the end of the reaction.2 All this poses
a serious issue to the pharmaceutical industry. The Pd supported on
carbon, silica, and zeolites are commonly employed in heterogeneous
catalysis.3−11 However, the Pd NPs supported on such surfaces are prone to aggregate
during the reaction, which leads to the loss of the catalytic activity.12,13 An obvious solution to the issue of Pd contamination is the use
of heterogeneous catalysts instead of their homogeneous counterparts,
wherein the catalyst may be coated with some organic supramolecular
systems not only to prevent the leaching but also to support the organic
transformations.

Hence, controlling the size and aggregation
of the NPs is important
in designing a better catalyst for effective organic transformations.
One of the useful methods for achieving such features for NPs is to
employ a reducing agent that is bound uniformly onto the surface of
the support. The Pd salt is then reduced on the surface, which results
primarily in monodispersed Pd NPs. There are some reports for the
synthesis of supported Pd catalysts on prefunctionalized surfaces
carrying ligands such as carbenes, phosphines, vinyl, and hydride-functionalized
mesoporous silica.14−17 Recently, we have reported a tetraallyl calixarene (allylCalix)
conjugate that is covalently functionalized on to the mesoporous silica
NPs (MCM-allylCalix) and demonstrated its drug storage and delivery
aspects.18 In the present case, the same
MCM-allylCalix is utilized for the synthesis of Pd(0) NPs by sacrificial
oxidation of a calixarene conjugate resulting in Pd@MCM-Calixox. The resulting ternary hybrid possesses a hydrophobic calixarene
conjugate, a heterogeneous surface, and the capability to reduce.
This makes the heterogeneous Pd catalyst as stable, resistant to metal
leaching and sintering, and is useful for carrying out the organic
transformations in water. The synthetic strategy is green and environmentally
benign as it avoids the use of external reducing agents, which is
common among many reports.19−21 The ternary hybrid was successfully
demonstrated in water for causing industrially important Suzuki C–C
coupling, for reducing the nitroaromatic compounds to give industrially
useful amino-based precursors, and for the degradation of the organic
dyes.

Results and Discussion
The MCM-41 has been covalently
attached with the allylCalix derivative
to give MCM-allylCalix and then loaded with Pd(0) NPs by reducing
the Pd(II) salt to result in Pd@MCM-Calixox.

Role of the
AllylCalix in the Reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0)
When Pd(II)
is reduced to Pd(0) by the allylCalix (no external
reducing agent is used), the calix derivative is oxidized, that is,
oxidized calix (Calixox). To prove that the Pd(II) is reduced
to Pd(0) by the allylCalix, an experiment was carried out by refluxing
allylCalix with palladium acetate, and the black colored solid product
(Pd@Calixox) was isolated by centrifugation, washed several
times with water, and characterized thoroughly (Figure 1). The presence of the oxidized calix (Calixox) moiety was identified based on FTIR (νC=O at 1710 cm–1), 1H NMR (disappearance
of allyl protons 5.1 and 5.8 ppm), and ESI-MS (m/z = 649.28, 671.26, and 687.24 corresponding to the Calixox). The presence of the reduced Pd(0) was identified by powder
XRD (2θ = 39.8, 46.3, 67.1°), XPS (334.8 and 340 eV), and
TEM studies (Figure 1). The presence of Pd(0) can be gauged from the darker contrast of
the Pd NPs of 4–7 nm size in their TEM images. The lattice
fringes observed in HRTEM exhibited a distance of 0.230 nm, and this
corresponds to the Pd(111) plane.

Synthesis and Characterization of Pd@MCM-Calixox
MCM-41 anchored to a tetraallyl-calixarene conjugate; MCM-allylCalix
was synthesized according to the procedure reported by us.18 The Pd NPs immobilized on MCM-allylCalix, that
is, Pd@MCM-Calixox, were synthesized without employing
any external reducing agent as given in Scheme 1. The Pd@MCM-Calixox NPs were
characterized by thermal, spectral, and microscopy methods.

Representation for the Synthesis of Pd NPs Immobilized
onto MCM-allylCalix Hybrid
The TGA of Pd@MCM-Calixox hybrid shows 11.5%
weight
loss because of the removal of the adsorbed water followed by 18.2%
loss up to 700 °C due to the condensation of the silanol groups
as well as the combustion of the calixarene conjugate. This data has
been appropriately compared with the TGA data of the control systems,
such as MCM-41, allylCalix, and MCM-allylCalix (Figure 2a). All this corresponds to the presence
of ∼15.5% of calix conjugate in the ternary hybrid. The XPS
elemental analysis supported the presence of C = 24.7%, Si = 16.6%,
O = 54.2%, and Pd = 4.5%. Even the ICP-AES showed the presence of
4.65% of Pd. The formation of Pd(0) NPs onto MCM-allylCalix surface
is evidenced from the appearance of the peaks corresponding to 2θ
= 40, 46, and 68°, which are attributed to (111), (200), and
(220) planes typical for the Pd(0) fcc crystalline structure, and
the corresponding data was compared against control systems (Figure 2b). All this data
is consistent with the reported values.22−24 The XPS of Pd@MCM-Calixox showed two distinct peaks centered at 334.9 and 339.8 eV
for Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively (Figure 2c), which is in agreement
with the data reported for Pd(0).25 The
XPS and XRD data support successful reduction of Pd (II) to Pd(0)
without the use of any external reducing agent. The width and area
under the ν–OH vibrational band of the MCM-allylCalix
hybrid in its FTIR spectrum are dramatically decreased as compared
to that of the MCM-41, suggesting the condensation of several −OH
groups when the hybrid is formed. The FTIR of Pd@MCM-Calixox shows retention of all the bands observed for MCM-allylCalix, suggesting
the retention of the MCM-41 framework and the presence of the calix
moiety (Figure 2d).

The TEM image shows well-dispersed
spherical particles with an
average size of 120–140 nm in case of MCM-41, and the size
is reduced to 50–60 nm when conjugated with allylCalix, where
the mesoporous characteristics are intact (Supporting Information, Figure S1a,b). The TEM of Pd@MCM-Calixox shows the presence of Pd NPs as darker contrast (Figure 3a) with an average size of
12 ± 2 nm (inset Figure 3a). The presence of Pd was supported by linear mapping of
the elements as well by the EDX analysis (Figure 3b). The HRTEM of Pd@MCM-Calixox gives an interfringe distance of 0.228 nm that corresponds to the
(111) plane of Pd(0) (Figure 3c), supporting that the Pd(II) is reduced to Pd(0) on the
hybrid. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of
the Pd@MCM-Calixox (Figure 3d) support the presence of crystallinity in the hybrid.

Catalytic Applications of Pd@MCM-Calixox Hybrid for
Organic Transformations
The synthesized Pd@MCM-Calixox NPs were demonstrated for Suzuki C–C cross-coupling
reaction for the reduction of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nitroaromatic
compounds and for the degradation of organic dyes (anionic, cationic,
and neutral) using NaBH4.

Pd@MCM-Calixox Hybrid for Suzuki C–C Cross
Coupling
Recently, the use of Pd NPs as heterogeneous catalysts
in C–C coupling reactions has emerged as an important frontier
research.26−28 In this context, the applicability of this Pd@MCM-Calixox ternary hybrid was explored for Suzuki C–C cross-coupling
reaction of iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid using K2CO3 as a base in water. The reaction conditions were optimized
and found that 1 mg (0.09 mol % and ∼70 ppm of Pd), 80 °C,
and 6 h as optimum parameters for the catalyst amount, temperature,
and reaction time, respectively, and this results in 96% product formation
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). The
reaction scope was also investigated using a broader range of substituted
phenylboronic acid derivatives (Table 1) under the optimized conditions. It was observed that
the reaction proceeded with electron deficient as well as neutral
phenylboronic acid derivatives (Table 1, entries 1–6) with high conversions and product
selectivity toward cross-coupled products as major ones. However,
the electron rich derivatives showed additionally 10–25% of
homocoupled products (entries 7–10 in Table 1). Thus, it is worthy to note that both the
activating and deactivating substrates showed an excellent conversion
in water. The superior activity of the present ternary hybrid is attributed
to the formation of well-dispersed Pd(0) NPs due to the assistance
of calixarene conjugate and also owing to the hydrophobicity of the
calix conjugate that promotes the adsorption/diffusion of the substrate
molecules in water.

Catalyst
Regeneration and Recycling for the C–C Coupling
Study
The ternary hybrid catalyst, Pd@MCM-Calixox, was regenerated by centrifugation, followed by washing several
times with water and then by acetone, and followed by drying in a
desiccator. The recycling study of regenerated Pd@MCM-Calixox was demonstrated for five cycles of C–C coupling without
losing activity to any significant extent (Figure 4a). The regenerated catalyst was characterized
by XRD, XPS, and TEM to detect any structural and textural changes
occurred in the catalyst due to the reaction. The XRD and XPS of the
recycled catalyst support the presence of Pd(0) even after completing
five consecutive catalytic cycles (Figure 4b,c). The TEM of the recycled catalyst showed
the presence of Pd NPs of 8–10 nm size and did not induce any
aggregation (Figure 4c). The presence of crystalline Pd(0) can be gauged by SAED pattern
(Figure 4d). The stabilization
of Pd(0) and prevention from sintering even after several catalytic
cycles seem to be one of the major contributions of the calixarene
conjugate bound to MCM-41.

Suzuki C–C reaction that is demonstrated for five cycles. (b)

The catalytic efficiency of Pd@MCM-Calixox for the Suzuki
cross-coupling reaction has been compared with that of the reported
one in the literature24 where the studies
were carried out using Pd/MCM-41 but not possessing the calixarene
moiety. The comparison reveals that our system exhibits enhanced C–C
coupling activity and gives a high product yield even at low Pd content.

Pd@MCM-Calixox Catalyzed Reduction of Ar–NO2
The nitroaromatic compounds are few among the most
common organic pollutants and explosives, and hence, their conversion
to some value-added products is of great relevance and importance.29−36 The ternary nanohybrid, Pd@MCM-Calixox, was successfully
explored for the reduction of Ar–NO2 to industrially
important Ar–NH2 compounds as shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Reaction Scheme for
the Reduction of Nitroaromatic Compounds in Water
Using Pd@MCM-Calixox as Catalyst
The details of the study carried out in case of 4-NP are
given
here. The light yellow aqueous 4-NP solution shows an absorption maximum
at 318 nm, which is shifted to 400 nm after addition of sodium borohydride
(Supporting Information, Figure S3a). In
the absence of the catalyst, no change in the absorption spectrum
was observed even after standing for 60 min, indicating that the reduction
does not proceed without the catalyst (Supporting Information, Figure S3b). In the presence of the catalyst,
the reduction of 4-NP is initiated, and the absorption peak at 400
nm gradually decreases in intensity along with an increase in the
absorbance of a new peak at 300 nm, indicating the formation of 4-aminophenol
(Figure 5a). The completion
of the reaction is gauged by the decolorization of the reaction mixture
(Figure S3c of Supporting Information).
With increase in the catalyst concentration from 1 to 3.3 μg/mL,
the time required to complete the reaction was decreased by 20-fold
from 60 min to 3 min (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The observed increase in the rate of the reaction
is attributed to an increase in the number of catalytically active
Pd(0) centers. The plot of ln (Ct/C0) versus time showed a straight line supporting
pseudo first-order behavior of the present catalytic system as shown
in Figure 5b. The rate
constant increases by ∼34-fold from a catalyst concentration
of 1 μg/mL to 3.3 μg/mL (Figure 5c). The catalytic study carried out upon
repetitive use of the catalyst for five successive additions of 4-NP
as an online process (Figure 5d) revealed that the catalyst acts with almost the same efficiency
during every cycle.

of 4-NP

of Pd@MCM-Calixox. (b) Plot of ln (Ct/C0) versus reaction time for

(c) Rate constant for the reduction of 4-NP at different catalyst

at 400 nm before and after catalytic run. The second cycle was initiated
upon subsequent addition of 4-NP when at the first stage, added 4-NP
was converted to the product. This was continued for five consecutive
cycles.

The scope of Pd@MCM-Calixox for the reduction of both
hydrophobic (4-NT, 3-NT, NB, m-DNB, o-DNB, p-DNB, and 2,4-DNT) as well as hydrophilic
(4-NP, 3-NP, 2-NP, 2,4-DNP, TNP) nitroaromatics (Ar–NO2) has been tested under similar experimental conditions (Supporting Information, Figure S5). The ternary
hybrid, Pd@MCM-Calixox, showed an excellent catalytic activity
in the case of all these Ar–NO2 substrates with
higher TOFs and their TOFs follow an order m-DNB > o-DNB > p-DNB > DNT > DNP > 4-NT >
3-NP > 4-NP >
3-NT > NB > 2-NP > TNP (Figure 6). During the reduction, the electron withdrawing
groups impart
more positive charge to the phenyl moiety, thus leading to a rapid
electron transfer from Pd surface to Ar–NO2, whereas
the electron releasing groups do the reverse.37 Among the DNBs, the m-DNB shows 15–20% increase
in the TOF as compared to o-/p-DNB.
Among the DNT and DNP, the toluene derivative exhibited greater TOF
as one would expect due to the presence of the methyl group in the
former. As expected, 4-NT shows higher TOF as compared to 4-NP as
the organic calix conjugate facilitates the diffusion of hydrophobic
moieties to the catalytic center, which imparts greater reducing tendency.
Among ortho-, meta- and para- nitrophenols, the TOF follows a trend
as expected, 3-NP > 4-NP ≥ 2-NP, owing to the presence of
intramolecular
H-bonding in 2-NP. The intramolecular H-bonding capability and the
presence of three nitro groups are responsible for exhibiting least
reactivity in the case of TNP over all the other nitroaromatics studied.

moles of product)/(number of moles of catalyst in terms of Pd X time
in min)

Reductive Degradation of
Organic Dyes
The organic dyes
received particular attention as prominent environmental pollutants
owing to their carcinogenic effect on humans.29 Therefore, the degradation of such organic dyes is of great interest.
In this context, we have demonstrated the utility of the present ternary
hybrid, Pd@MCM-Calixox, for the reductive degradation of
six organic dyes, of which two are anionic (CR, MO), two are neutral
(BBY, NR), and the remaining two are cationic (R6G, MB), using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The main absorption peaks observed at
497, 465, 452, 450, 527, and 664 corresponds to CR, R6G, BBY, NR,
MO, and MB, respectively (Figure 7). The spectral data corresponding to R6G, MO, and
NR dyes are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). Upon addition of the catalyst, Pd@MCM-Calixox, the characteristic absorption band for CR and MO shows
gradual decrease in the absorbance as a function of time, whereas
a rapid decrease was observed in the case of BBY, NR, R6G, and MB
supporting the reductive decolorization of these dyes. The complete
reduction was observed within 45, 40, 4, 3, 1.5, and 1 min in the
case of CR, MO, NR, BBY, R6G, and MB, respectively. The comparison
of the TOF clearly shows that the dye degradation is dependent on
the charge nature of the dye and it follows a trend, namely, cationic
dye > neutral dye ≫> anionic dye (Figure 7d). This is due to the fact that the noble
metal NPs are capable of catalyzing the reduction owing to their ability
of assisting the electron relay from the donor to the acceptor.38,39 As a result, the surface of the NPs becomes partially negative and
hence exhibits greater affinity toward cationic dyes.

Figure 7 Reduction of the dyes
over Pd@MCM-Calixox catalyst in
the presence of NaBH4: (a) CR, (b) BBY, and (c) MB. In
all these three cases, the inset shows the photograph of vials containing
solutions before and after the reaction. (d) Bar diagram of TOF values
for the reduction of different organic dyes using Pd@MCM-Calixox as catalyst. Reaction conditions: organic dyes (MB, CR,
BBY) = 0.01 mM, NaBH4 = 5 mM, and Pd@MCM-Calixox = 1.66 μg/mL. TOF = (moles of product)/(moles of catalyst
in terms of Pd X time in min).

To understand the process of degradation of these organic
dyes,
the reaction mixture has been analyzed by ESI-MS in each case, and
the corresponding data is given in the Supporting Information (Figure S7) for MO, NR, and R6G and in Scheme 3 for CR, MB, and
BBY. The ESI-MS of reduced MB showed the presence of [M]+ for leuco-MB, which agrees well with the literature report.40 The reduced BBY showed the presence of an intensive
peak for [M + H]+, suggesting the reduction of BBY by the
addition of four hydrogens to the two azo groups that destroys the
conjugation in the molecule and results in the loss of the color.
The negative ion ESI-MS of reduced CR showed fragments of the molecule
as given in Scheme 3, suggesting the reductive degradation of CR by Pd@MCM-Calixox in the presence of NaBH4.

Conclusions and Comparisons
The heterogeneous catalyst
based on Pd(0), MCM-41, and calixarene
conjugate has been synthesized and characterized by several physicochemical
techniques to support the formation of Pd(0) species generated via
sacrificial
oxidation of the calixarene conjugate functionalized with mesoporous
silica NPs. The formation of Pd(0) is coupled with the oxidation of
the allylic carbon of the calix conjugate as demonstrated by performing
a reaction between the allylCalix and the palladium acetate. The XRD,
XPS, and TEM analyses of Pd@Calixox supported the reduction
of Pd(II) to Pd(0) whereas, FTIR, 1H NMR, and ESI-MS supported
the oxidation of the allylCalix conjugate.

Similarly, in the
case of Pd@MCM-Calixox, the FTIR supported
the retention of silica framework structure and also the presence
of calix conjugate upon incorporation of Pd(0) species, and the elemental
composition was determined. The TEM (12 ± 2 nm), STEM, HR-TEM
(0.228 nm of line spacing), SAED, powder XRD (fcc lattice), and XPS
all supported the reduction of Pd(II) and confirmed the presence of
Pd(0).

The utility of this ternary hybrid was demonstrated for
Suzuki
C–C cross coupling, for the reduction of Ar–NO2 compounds, and for the degradation of organic dyes, which were all
in water. Industrially important Suzuki C–C cross-coupling
reaction of iodobenzene with phenylboronic acid and its derivatives
was successfully performed over Pd@MCM-Calixox as a catalyst
upon using experimentally determined optimum conditions for obtaining
a maximum product yield. The scope of the catalyst for C–C
cross-coupling reaction was extended to 10 different substituents
on phenylboronic acid using 0.09 mol % of the catalyst that yielded
excellent TOFs specially for electron withdrawing substituents. The
catalyst was further regenerated and reused for demonstrating the
coupling reaction up to five cycles without the loss of much activity.
The ICP-AES data supported only <4% loss of Pd even after five
cycles. Further, the characterization of the recycled catalyst by
XRD and TEM supported the robustness of the catalyst.

The kinetic
study for the reduction of 4-NP over Pd@MCM-Calixox showed
pseudo first-order dependence. The catalyst was effective
in the reduction of different hydrophilic and hydrophobic nitroaromatics
and yielded high TOFs when 0.1 ppm of the Pd(0) catalyst was employed.
The trend in the reducing activity for 12 different Ar–NO2 is as follows: m-DNB > o-DNB > p-DNB > DNT > DNP > 4-NT > 3-NP > 4-NP >
3-NT > NB > 2-NP > TNP. The
same catalyst has been demonstrated for the reduction of organic dyes
in presence of NaBH4 and observed that the reaction conversions
are in the order: MB, R6G > BBY, NR ≫ MO, CR. The positively
charged dyes (R6G and MB) were reduced at least 3-fold better than
the neutral ones (BBY, NR). Meanwhile, the reduction of the dyes in
water in presence of the catalyst is noticed from the decolorization
of the dye solution. The reduced and/or the degraded products of the
dyes were identified from their ESI-MS analysis. Overall, high TOFs
were observed upon using 0.07 ppm of Pd-based catalyst in water, suggesting
that the Pd@MCM-Calixox hybrid is effective in reductive
degradation of different types of organic dyes from water.

The
highlights of the synthesis and catalytic application of the
ternary hybrid, Pd@MCM-Calixox, are summarized pictorially
in Scheme 4. In all
the three catalytic applications, very high activities were observed
with different kinds of substrates by using an extremely low Pd content
and in water as a solvent. The presence of calixarene conjugate plays
an important role in the ternary hybrid system (a) by acting as a
reducing agent, (b) by controlling the size of Pd(0) NPs, (c) by giving
well-dispersed Pd(0) NPs, (d) by preventing leaching and sintering
of Pd(0) NPs, and (e) by providing sufficient hydrophobicity that
drives the substrate molecules toward catalytic centers. The reductant-free
synthesis, extremely low Pd content, use of water solvent, recyclability,
and high TOFs make the present catalytic system greener and environmentally
friendly.

Synthesis and Characterization
of Inorganic–Organic Hybrid
of MCM-41 and AllylCalix (MCM-allylCalix)
The synthesis of
MCM-allylCalix was carried out by following the procedure18 reported by us as given in the Supporting Information SI01. Yield = 378 mg. EDS elemental
analysis: C = 25.9%, O = 53.1%, Si = 21%. The detailed characterization
of MCM-allylCalix was already reported by us earlier.15

Synthesis and Characterization of Pd(0) NPs
Supported by MCM-Calix
Hybrid and Pd@MCM-Calixox
The Pd@MCM-Calixox was synthesized by taking 1.5 mg (6.6 × 10–3 mM) of palladium acetate in 4 mL of (1:1) acetonitrile/water mixture.
To this, 15 mg of MCM-allylCalix was added, and the reaction mixture
was refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The dark colored solid product,
Pd@MCM-Calixox, was separated by centrifugation, washed
with 10 mL of water for five times, and then dried in a desiccator
for 24 h. Yield = 13 mg. The ICP-AES showed the presence of 4.65%
Pd in Pd@MCM-Calixox. The XPS elemental analysis suggested
that C = 24.7%, Si = 16.6%, O = 54.2%, and Pd = 4.5%, and the loading
of calix conjugate based on TGA is 15.5%. The characterization of
the Pd@MCM-Calixox hybrid was carried out by XPS, XRD,
TGA, FTIR, and TEM.

Catalyst Testing
Suzuki Coupling Reaction
To a well-stirred mixture
of iodobenzene (55 μL, 0.49 mM), phenylboronic acid (90 mg,
0.74 mM), and K2CO3 (136 mg, 0.98 mM) in water
(1.5 mL), 1 mg of the catalyst, Pd@MCM-Calixox (0.09 mol%
with respect to Pd) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at
80 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products
were extracted with diethyl ether (15 mL) for two times. The organic
phase was then dried over Na2SO4, filtered,
and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by silica
gel column chromatography using pet-ether/ethyl acetate in 95:5 v/v
ratio.

Reduction of Nitroaromatic Compounds
In the reduction
of different nitroaromatic compounds, Ar–NO2 was
carried out over Pd@MCM-Calixox in water by using NaBH4. The catalytic reduction reaction was carried out in a quartz
cuvette by taking 50 μL of 2 mM of Ar–NO2 and
1000 μL of 0.2 M NaBH4. The concentration of stock
solution of Pd@MCM-Calixox was 0.1 mg/mL in water, and
different volumes of catalyst solution were added for the hydrogenation
reaction keeping the total volume of a reaction mixture constant at
3 mL. The concentration of the reaction mixture in the cuvette was
Ar–NO2 = 0.034 mM, NaBH4 = 68 mM, and
Pd@MCM-Calixox = 1–3.3 μg/mL. Upon addition
of the catalyst, the solutions were quickly subjected to UV–vis
spectral measurements as a function of time to observe gradual changes
in the absorption. The stock solution of hydrophobic substrates, namely,
nitrobenzene (NB), m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB), p-dinitrobenzene (p-DNB), o-dinitrobenzene (o-DNB), 2,4-dinitrotoluene
(2,4-DNT), 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT), 3-nitrotoluene (3-NT) was prepared
in ethanol, and the stock solution for p-nitrophenol
(4-NP), m-nitrophenol (3-NP), o-nitrophenol
(2-NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), trinitrophenol (TNP) was prepared
in water.

Reductive Degradation of Organic Dyes
Reduction of
various organic dyes, namely, methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO),
Congo red (CR), Rhodamine 6G (R6G), neutral red (NR) and Bismarck
brown Y (BBY) was carried out. Briefly, 100 μL of Pd@MCM-Calixox (50 μg/mL in water) was added to a quartz cuvette
containing a mixture of 0.01 mM of organic dye (MB, MO, CR, R6G, NR,
BBY) and 5 mM NaBH4 to achieve a final volume of 3 mL in
water medium. The degradation of organic dyes was monitored by measuring
time dependant UV–vis absorption spectra of the reaction mixture.
