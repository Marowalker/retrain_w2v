Introduction
Difunctionalization
of organic substrates is a powerful tool in
modern organic synthesis, which mainly involves alkynes as well as
alkenes in organic synthesis.1−13 It has been widely studied and utilized in various techniques for
functional group interconversions.14−17 Difunctionalization of alkenes
is an attractive method for introducing a set of groups during a one-pot
reaction process.18,19 Dithiocyanation of alkynes and
alkenes is meaningful as they show fungicidal activity.20 In addition, different sulfur derivatives can
be synthesized from the thiocyanates.21−24 These can be easily converted
to different compounds such as sulfides, disulfides, thioesters, thiols,
thiocarbamates, and many sulfur heterocycles.25−34 Therefore, efficient incorporation of the thiocyano group into organic
molecules has drawn much attention.

Few methods have been developed
for the dithiocyanation of alkenes
using different catalytic systems such as combination of PhI(OAc)2/trialkylsilyl cyanide or potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) reagent,35,36 cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate-mediated thiocyanation of styrenes,37 FeCl3,38 and recently Cu-catalyzed dithiocyanation in the presence of NH4SCN and selectfluor reagent combination.39 However, to the best of our knowledge, dithiocyanation
of alkynes is very rare. Only one method has been reported previously.40 It is worthy to mention that most of the previous
methods suffer from at least one of the following general disadvantages
such as low-to-moderate yields, lengthy reaction time, vigorous conditions,
use of toxic as well as expensive metals, and complex reagent combination.
It should be mentioned that none of these methods are applicable for
dithiocyanation of both alkynes and alkenes under fully similar conditions.
Hence, the development of a new and common reagent system which is
useful for synthesizing dithiocyanate derivatives from alkynes as
well as alkenes is highly desirable. Therefore, in continuation of
our research,41−47 herein we are pleased to report a simple and convenient process
for the dithiocyanation of alkynes as well as alkenes in a short reaction
time in the presence of potassium thiocyanate and sodium persulfate
reagent combination (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Transition Metal-Free 1,2-Dithiocyanation of Alkynes
and Alkenes
Results and Discussion
This study was initiated by observing the reaction of 1 equiv of
phenyl acetylene 1a and 2 equiv of KSCN (2) employing 1 equiv of sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) as the oxidant in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) solvent
at room temperature under ambient air for 30 min. Gratifyingly, the
desired dithiocyanated coupling product, (1,2-dithiocyanatovinyl)benzene
(3a), was obtained in a 55% yield after 30 min (Table 1, entry 1). This result
encouraged us to optimize the reaction in different conditions, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. To interpret the solvent effects, the reaction was
examined in various solvents (Table 1, entries 2–10). To our pleasure, the desired
product was isolated in an excellent yield (90%) in toluene after
30 min (Table 1, entry
7). The yield was not improved significantly by increasing the reaction
time. Other common solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran
(THF), 1,4-dioxane, CH3CN, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-400, and water were
not so effective. Other oxidants such as ammonium persulfate [(NH4)2S2O8], potassium persulfate
(K2S2O8), and di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) were also investigated. These were not so
effective for this transformation (Table 1, entries 11–13). Ammonium thiocyanate
(NH4SCN), as the thiocyanate source, is also not effective
for this transformation (Table 1, entry 14). A higher amount of oxidant loading (2 equiv)
did not improve the yield further (Table 1, entry 15), but on decreasing the amount
of oxidant (0.5 equiv), the yield was decreased considerably (Table 1, entry 16). In addition,
by increasing the amount of KSCN, the yield was not improved (Table 1, entry 17). The reaction
did not proceed at all in the absence of any oxidant (Table 1, entry 18) as well as under
neat condition (Table 1, entry 19). Therefore, on the basis of the series of experiments
(Table 1, entries 1–19),
we considered the optimized reaction conditions by using 2 equiv of
KSCN and 1 equiv of Na2S2O8 in toluene
for 30 min at room temperature under ambient air (Table 1, entry 7).

a Reaction conditions: carried out
with 1 mmol of 1a and 2 mmol of SCN source in 2 mL of
solvent at room temperature for 30 min.

b All are isolated yields.

c Reaction time 12 h.

Considering the optimization of the reaction conditions, we examined
the general applicability by increasing the substrate scope (Scheme 2). A series of 1,2-dithiocyanated
alkenes were obtained in good to excellent yields under the present
reaction conditions (3a–3s). Phenyl acetylenes
with electron-donating substituents on the benzene ring (such as −Me, tert-butyl, and −OMe) afforded the corresponding
1,2-dithiocyanated alkenes in excellent yields (3b, 3c, 3d, and 3e). Electron-withdrawing
substituents on the benzene ring of the phenyl acetylene moiety (such
as −F and −NO2) efficiently reacted with
KSCN to produce the respective 1,2-dithiocyanated alkene derivatives
(3f, 3g, and 3h). Carbonyl
functionality is also well tolerated to afford the desired product
in good yield (3i). Heteroaryl-substituted terminal alkyne
(such as 3-ethynylthiophene 1j) also reacted smoothly
under the optimized reaction conditions (3j). In addition,
aliphatic terminal alkynes were also found to afford the desired products
in high yields (3k–3n). Apart from aryl acetylenes,
alkenyl acetylene (1m) is also a good substrate for the
reaction. Two oxy-substituted terminal alkynes were also tested; they
also furnished the desired products in excellent yields (3o and 3p).

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope for the 1,2-Dithiocyanation
of Various Alkynes
Reaction conditions: 1 (1 mmol) and 2 (2 mmol) in the presence of 1 equiv
of Na2S2O8 in 2 mL of toluene for
30 min at room temperature.

It is worthy to
mention that the present reaction conditions are
equally effective for internal alkynes. We have examined three different
internal alkynes such as oct-4-yne (1q), prop-1-yn-1-ylbenzene
(1r), and ethyl 3-phenylpropiolate (1s);
all of these afforded the desired products (3q–3s) in excellent yields. However, 1-ethynylcyclohexan-1-ol (1t) and 1,2-diphenylethyne (1u) remained unreacted under
the present reaction conditions. During our studies on the substrate
scope, we have selectively found the 1,2-dithocyanation product. Only
the formation of monothiocyanated alkene derivatives (4a and 4b) has been observed in cases of 2-ethynylpyridine
and dimethyl acetylene dicarboxylate in 88 and 89% yields, respectively
(Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Formation
of Monothiocyanated Vinyl Derivatives
Reaction
conditions: 1 (1 mmol) and 2 (2 mmol) in
the presence of 1 equiv
of Na2S2O8 in 2 mL of toluene for
30 min at room temperature.

To explore the
scope of the present methodology, we used styrene
derivatives to synthesize diverse vicinal dithiocyanate derivatives
(Scheme 4). Styrenes 5 with different substituents on the aromatic ring, including
electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, can be transformed
into the corresponding products 6 in good yields. Styrene
having a −Me substituent on the benzene ring reacted with KSCN
efficiently to afford the product with good yield (6b). Halo-substituted styrenes were well tolerated in the dithiocyanation
reaction (6c and 6d). In addition, we are
pleased to notice that 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE) gave the desired
product (6e) with good yields under the stated reaction
conditions. To make the reaction more greener aspect, we tried the
reaction for both alkyne and alkene by light in the presence of a
photocatalyst instead of persulfate. The desirable product for alkyne
was found with low yield, whereas for styrene no satisfactory product
has been isolated (see the Supporting Information).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Diverse Vicinal Dithiocyanate Derivatives from
Styrenes
Reaction conditions: 1 mmol of 5 and 2 mmol of 2 in the presence of 1 equiv
of Na2S2O8 in 2 mL of toluene at
room temperature for 30 min.

As an application,
we observed that this protocol is extendable
for diselenylation of styrenes using KSeCN instead of KSCN with a
combination of similar reagents (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Diselenylation of Styrenes Using Potassium
Selenocyanate
Reaction conditions: 5 (1 mmol) and 7 (2 mmol) in the presence of 1 equiv
of Na2S2O8 in 2 mL of 1,2-DCE for
3 h at room temperature.

All these reactions
are not sensitive to air and moisture and were
performed under an open atmosphere. The reaction conditions are mild
enough and found no decomposition or polymerization of the starting
materials. We have not observed any considerable byproducts for all
reactions studied. All of the synthesized compounds have been characterized
by spectral data and the new compounds by spectral and analytical
data. X-ray crystallographic analysis of ethyl (E)-3-phenyl-2,3-dithiocyanatoacrylate (3s) was performed
to confirm the structure of the product as shown in Figure 1.48 In addition, we have also carried out correlation spectroscopy and
nuclear Overhauser effect NMR experiment of compound 3c where we did not find any cross-peak and trans-conformation was
confirmed. For this present reaction, the workup procedure can be
avoided. The solvent (toluene) was evaporated under rotary evaporator
after completion of the reaction, and the crude reaction mixture was
purified by column chromatography using silica gel.

Figure 1 X-ray crystal structure
of compound 3s.

To get a better understanding of the mechanism of this reaction,
few control experiments were carried out (Scheme 6). In the presence of radical scavengers
such as (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT), no product was obtained, whereas a trace amount
of product was obtained in the presence of 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) and
DPE. These results suggest that the reaction probably proceeds through
a radical pathway.

Scheme 6 Control Experiments
Reaction
conditions: 1a (1 mmol), KSCN (2 mmol), and 3 mmol of
different radical scavengers
in the presence of 1 equiv of Na2S2O8 in 2 mL of toluene for 30 min at room temperature.

In a mixture (1:1) of phenyl acetylene (1a) and DPE
(5e) with 2 equiv of KSCN when subjected to react under
the same reaction conditions, only the DPE (5e) participated
in the reaction to afford the desired product (6e), whereas
compound 3a was isolated as trace amount (Scheme 7). Therefore, the reaction
is selective and shows the high reactivity of alkenes than alkynes.
In other words, we can say that here DPE (5e) acts as
a radical scavenger, which also proves that the reaction goes through
a radical pathway.

Scheme 7 Competitive Reaction between Alkynes and Alkenes
On the basis of the above experimental
results and literature,35−37,49−53 a plausible mechanism is proposed in Scheme 8. Initially, an electrophilic
thiocyanate radical I is generated by the oxidation of thiocyanate
anion by Na2S2O8. Subsequent radical
addition of I to alkyne derivative (1) produces carbon-centered radical
II, which was further oxidized to the corresponding carbocation III
by Na2S2O8. Then, the nucleophilic
reaction of thiocyanate anion (path a) with the carbocation III forms
the desired product 3. Another pathway is possible (path
b), which involves the coupling of thiocyanate radical with intermediate
II to form the desired product 3.

Scheme 8 Proposed Reaction
Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed a mild and metal-free method for
the 1,2-dithiocyanation of alkynes in a short reaction time using
the reagent combination of sodium persulfate and potassium thiocyanate.
A variety of 1,2-dithiocyanated alkene derivatives have been synthesized
with broad functionalities in high yields. The present methodology
is also useful for the dithiocyanation of styrene derivatives to provide
a variety of vicinal dithiocyanate derivatives. We also observed the
formation of monothiocyanated vinyl derivatives in cases of 2-ethynylpyridine
and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. The selectivity of this reaction
was also tested by carrying out the reaction between phenyl acetylene
and DPE. We believe that our present methodology is a meaningful addition
over the existing methods to synthesize important building blocks
of 1,2-dithiocyanated alkene and alkane derivatives.

Experimental
Section
General
All substrates and reagents we have used in
the experiment were purchased from commercial sources and used without
any purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a
400 MHz spectrometer, and CDCl3 was used as the solvent.
Chemical shifts were expressed in parts per million (ppm) (δ)
and coupling constants (J) were given in hertz, whereas
the signals were represented as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
m (multiplet), and dd (double doublet). 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 100 MHz, and 77Se NMR spectra were recorded
at 76 MHz in CDCl3 solution. Chemical shifts as internal
standard were referenced to CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 for 1H and δ = 77.16 for 13C NMR). Precoated silica
gel on an aluminum foil was used for thin layer chromatography (TLC)
with dried and distilled solvent before use.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Compounds 3
A mixture of alkyne
(1, 1 mmol), KSCN (194
mg, 2 mmol), and sodium persulfate (238 mg, 1 mmol) was taken in a
dry sealed tube, and 2 mL of toluene was added to this mixture. The
resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After
completion of the reaction (TLC), the crude product was isolated just
by evaporation of the solvent (toluene) in a rotary evaporator under
reduced pressure. No conventional workup procedure has been followed.
The crude reaction mixture was purified by column chromatography on
silica gel (60–120 mesh) using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate
as eluents.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 6
A mixture of alkene (5, 1 mmol), KSCN
(194
mg, 2 mmol), and sodium persulfate (238 mg, 1 mmol) was taken in a
dry sealed tube. Toluene (2 mL) was added to the mixture, and the
resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After
completion of the reaction (TLC), the solvent (toluene) was evaporated
in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, and the crude reaction
mixture was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (60–120
mesh) using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluents.

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 8
A
mixture of alkene (5, 1 mmol), KSeCN (288
mg, 2 mmol), and sodium persulfate (238 mg, 1 mmol) was taken in a
dry sealed tube. 1,2-DCE (2 mL) was added to the mixture, and the
resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. After completion
of the reaction (TLC), the solvent (1,2-DCE) was evaporated in a rotary
evaporator under reduced pressure, and the crude reaction mixture
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (60–120
mesh) using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluents.
