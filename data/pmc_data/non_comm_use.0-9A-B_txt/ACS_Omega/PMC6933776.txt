This paper reports the results of a spectroscopic study
on the
chemistry of some small papyrus fragments arising from three Egyptian
excavation sites. The aim of this investigation was to verify the
possibility to identify significant differences in ancient Egyptian
papyri using noninvasive analytical methods, that is, ATR (attenuated
total reflection)–FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopic
imaging and scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy. Differences in both lignin and cellulose compositions,
which are difficult to detect with traditional FTIR and FTIR imaging
spectral analysis, were revealed by the multivariate approach, and
the second derivative spectroscopy was applied to enhance the spectrum
resolution. Thus, it has been possible to recognize a fragment characterized
by the presence of lead and of long chain aliphatic organic compound,
which are not present in the other fragments, in the ink region. These
data show not only that the combination of these techniques can provide
important chemical information, such as to evidence the different
compositions and manufacture of each papyrus, but also that metal
inks were probably used also in ancient Egyptian papyri.

Introduction
The application of analytical techniques
to art and archaeological
artifacts can provide information about compositions, structures,
and physico-chemical behavior of objects, which can be useful for
historians, art experts, etc. These data are indeed fundamental to
establish better conservation conditions to test the authenticity
of the artifacts and to perform restoration. The development of sensitive
and nondestructive techniques has favored the study of this kind of
objects that, however, requires the interdisciplinary collaboration
between the scientists, art historians, and archaeologists.

Egyptian papyri are surely one of our most important sources for
understanding the culture and history of the ancient world, having
preserved a wide range of texts, such as literary manuscripts, personal
correspondence, contracts, petitions, census declarations, property
declarations, and tax receipts. Furthermore, for many of them, we
know the date and the place where they were written and/or found,
providing a useful complement to other forms of ancient evidence.

Papyri served as a writing support for thousands of years. The
first evidence for the use of papyrus in the production of writing
substrates dates to the third millennium BCE, in ancient Egypt, and
it remained in use until the Middle Ages. Centuries after production,
the ancient papyri have been excavated or purchased and then stored
in several museums and libraries. Today, hundreds of thousands of
papyrus fragments serve as an important source for philological, literary,
linguistic, and historical studies.

Papyri are generally constituted
of different strips, derived from
the homonymous plant, pressed, and dried in the sun. Their composition
and manufacture techniques have been object of intensive investigation.
Thermogravimetric and elemental analysis have been done on ancient
and modern papyri by Wiedeman et al., showing that they are composed
of lignocellulosic materials (50–60% cellulose and 20–30%
lignin, with traces of silicon, aluminum, and calcium).1 However, different scriptoria or geographical
areas as well as different periods have been characterized by the
use of specific materials and preparation techniques. Furthermore,
lignocellulosic materials can undergo more or less strong oxidation
processes depending on the age of the manuscript, the source of the
plant, the manufacturing processes, and the external environmental
conditions.2 Recently, many analytical
techniques have been used not only to evaluate the chemical composition
of different historical artifacts but also to determine degradation
parameters, that is, the overall oxidation of the lignocellulosic
material, degree of polymerization, and crystallinity of cellulose.3 In particular, spectroscopy has offered the opportunity
for nondestructive characterization of these materials.4,5 Thus, Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared
(ATR–FTIR) spectroscopies have been extensively used to identify
the chemical composition of selected pigments6−8 on manuscripts,
including ancient Egyptian papyri, through determination of the characteristic
vibrational frequencies of specific molecular entities. In the specific
case of ancient papyri and parchments, several studies demonstrated
that black inks were mainly composed of carbon black and arabic gum,
egg tempera, or beeswax as binders,9 without
any kind of added heavy metal (the introduction of these latter is
normally traced to the advent of iron gall).10,11 Nonetheless, heavy metals have been found by modern analysis in
black and colored inks used in various parts of Egypt;11 and recent works by Brun et al. have revealed
the presence of lead also in papyri found at Herculaneum.12−14 Actually, in that work, the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique was
able to detect the presence of metal in the ink. At the same time,
copper has also been found by XRF analysis in Herculaneum papyri by
Brun et al.,12 confirming once more that
in papyri present in Italy, different metals were added in inks.

In recent years, FTIR spectroscopy has been coupled with imaging
techniques, thanks to focal plane array (FPA) detectors, giving the
possibility to obtain with relatively short analysis times spatial
and spectroscopic information about the analyzed sample with minimal
preparation and without destruction: ultrathin samples can be analyzed
without resin embedding. Furthermore, the spatial resolution size
(around 2 μm) characterizing this technique provides high levels
of detail and chemical information and consents the identification
of defects and variations in chemical composition on this scale. Thus,
the FTIR imaging technique was applied to six fragments of ancient
Egyptian papyri. Furthermore, since the analysis of the collected
FTIR spectroscopic data resulted was made complicated by the overlapping
of most of the absorption peaks, second derivative spectroscopy has
been applied to enhance peak separation, and a multivariate analysis
method has been used to evaluate differences in chemical composition,
characterizing the examined fragments. Finally, scanning electron
microscopy–energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDXS)
was carried out on the same fragments to obtain further information
on the composition of papyri and inks.

Results and Discussion
Six small fragments of ancient
Egyptian papyri were purchased from
Istituto Papirologico Girolamo Vitelli (University of Florence). The
six fragments came from three different sites (Antinoupolis, Tebtynis,
and Oxyrhynchus) excavated by the Societá Italiana per la ricerca
dei papiri greci e latini in Egitto during the first half of the 20th
century. No other information about these fragments was available.

Initially, a rough analysis of the papyri fragments was done by
SEM–EDXS and with an ATR–FTIR spectrometer.

As
shown in Figure 1,
the SEM micrograph detail of the surface region of the examined
fragments highlights the multilayer structure characterizing all the
investigated samples: fibers and fractures are moreover evident in
several fragments. Differences in compactness can be also seen in
the region without ink, suggesting different manufacture procedures.
Furthermore, on the surface of some of them, crystals can be also
observed. These “white spots” (i.e., small crystal encrustations,
almost absent in the Tebtynis papyrus fragment), have been identified
on the basis of the EDXS analysis as sodium chloride, silicon, and
calcium depositions. The presence of NaCl as small crystals on papyri
is not unusual although their source is not clear yet. Different hypotheses
have been formulated: NaCl could arise from the papyrus itself, from
the manufactory procedure implying strips rewetting, or from subsequent
contaminations. At the same time, the presence of silicon could also
arise from the plant, whereas calcium origin is probably linked to
the manufacture of the papyrus itself, as other studies already stated.15

Figure 1 Visible and SEM images of six papyrus samples (A and A′:
Antinoe, B and B′: Tebtynis, C and C′: Oxyrhynchus)
analyzed in the region indicated by arrows.

Furthermore, SEM–EDXS spectra (Supporting Information) show that all the examined ancient papyri fragments
are constituted, as expected, by O, C, Ca, and Cl beside variable
amounts of Al, P, S, K, Fe, and Si. Silicon, which is present in different
amounts in all samples, is in the form of quartz grains, arising from
sand (Table 1). Data
that are much more interesting arise, however, by the EDXS analysis
of the regions containing ink. In two samples, indeed, the presence
of relevant amounts of heavy metals, in particular, Pb, was detected.
Whereas most of the examined samples contain only small amounts of
iron both in ink and bulk, sample B (Tebtynis papyrus ink in Figure 2) presents a significant
amount of Pb (around 19%), and, when scanned, the Antinoe fragment
A (Figure 3) shows
that Pb is present at higher concentrations with respect to iron in
the ink zone. The high concentration of Pb in the Tebtynis fragment
seems to exclude contamination due to the water used to prepare the
ink or to the employed inkpot, as the concentration is not only at
a trace level. This might suggest that Pb was used by the scribe to
give a specific effect to the work.

a Quantitative scale

Papyri are quite fragile and sensitive to dryness,
and they are
therefore normally wetted at the moment of finding. However, it is
well-known that the presence of water in cellulosic materials can
affect FTIR analysis of ancient and contemporary papyri, being the
water bending band at around 1640 cm–1 able to shield
the frequency range where we can find vibrations of cellulose products
degradation (carbonyl groups). Thus, samples were gently dried in
vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h, following a previously reported procedure,
with slight modifications.3

As shown
in Figure 4, the desorption
of water from the Antinoe papyrus fragment A′
determines, as expected, a modification of the 1640 cm–1 band and the appearance of two new bands at around 1736 (practically,
a shoulder) and 1618 cm–1, which could be attributed
to aldehydic and conjugated ketonic groups arising from cellulose
oxidation3 or on lignin, the other papyrus
component.

Figure 4 Normalized FTIR spectra of A′ Antinoe papyrus as it is (red)
or after drying (black)

Furthermore, all the collected spectra (Supporting Information) both in the region with and without ink show a
broad peak at around 3330 cm–1, imputable to the
stretching band of cellulose OH and to the presence of water.16 At around 2900 cm–1 are instead
the absorption bands due to aliphatic CH2 and CH stretching
modes, whereas the small absorption bands between 1520 and 1200 cm–1 can be referred to stretching and deformations of
various aromatic components of lignin. The strong absorption at 1000
cm–1 is instead due to the C–O stretching
vibration mode of cellulose. Finally, small absorption bands between
800 and 500 cm–1 characterize all examined samples.

After drying, the more evident differences between fragment regions
with or without ink, as well as among papyri fragments arising from
different sites, appeared localized in the region between 1600 and
1100 cm–1, a region unfortunately characterized
by the presence of a multitude of overlapped medium-weak bands (Figure 5). These FTIR spectra
are removed from the average of about 1000 different spectra analyzed
in regions without ink of papyri A, B, and C. At first glance, however,
slight differences going from one sample to another can be evidenced.

(black), (B) Tebtynis (red), and (C) Oxyrhynchus (blue)

In order to obtain further information about papyri
and ink composition,
the FTIR imaging analysis was performed on the same fragments.

In particular, analyses were conducted with 4 cm–1 resolution and 256 scans, in a range from 3000 to 900 cm–1, with 4 × 2 tiles mosaic, in absorbance mode. This procedure
was applied to all six papyrus fragments. Different wavenumbers (2915,
1630, 1500, 1323, and 1020 cm–1) were monitored
for each fragment in order to identify changes in false color images
thanks to the focal plane array (FPA) detector and to make a comparison
with respect to the visible picture of the papyri. This technique
allowed us to obtain chemical and spatial information at a micrometer
level. In particular, integrating the area of each band (1020, 1323,
1500, 1630, and 2915 cm–1), we obtained the corresponding
false color image, representing the absorption intensity of a peculiar
chemical group.

As expected, cellulose and lignin, characterized
by the absorption
bands at 1020 cm–1 (cellulose) and 1630, 1500, and
1323 cm–1 (lignin), are analogously distributed
in all examined fragments. Generally, similar color variations from
blue to red (blue: less concentrated, red: most concentrated) characterize,
with the exception of B′ Tebtynis, all the fragments when monitored
at 1020 cm–1 or 1630, 1500, and 1323 cm–1.

Finally, it is noteworthy that, whereas in the visible images,
a clear distinction between regions containing or not ink can be immediately
detected, in the false color images, this difference emerges only
in the case of Antinoe sample, in particular when monitored at 2915
cm–1, corresponding to the stretching bands of aliphatic
C–H. This could suggest, in our opinion, the presence in this
region, and therefore in the employed ink, of higher concentrations
of compounds containing long aliphatic chains, for example, the use
of wax as binder could justify this behavior. It is noteworthy that
Antinoe papyrus A contains also relevant amounts of Pb in the ink
region, and the fact that this sample shows a different organic component
associated to the same region might support the hypothesis that a
different ink was used.

Finally, in order to evaluate more accurately
eventual other differences
in the chemical composition characterizing the examined papyri, principal
component analysis (PCA) of the imaging spectra reported in Figure 6 has been performed.
Second derivative spectroscopy was applied to the collected spectra
to enhance resolution, obtaining information from molecular vibration
data.

Figure 6 Visible and FPA images of six papyri (A and A′: Antinoe,
B and B′: Tebtynis, C and C′: Oxyrhynchus) integrating
the band at each indicated wavenumber.

Each recorded wavelength is a variable.17 The spectra has been sampled with a step of
1.93 cm–1, corresponding to a number of variables
ranging from 1100 to 1300,
and each point sampled by the FPA matrix corresponds to a different
value for each variable (from 6500 to 8200 points, depending on sample
size). PCA is indeed widely used when a large amount of data, in this
case thousands of FTIR spectra for each sample, is available.17 A different and independent analysis has been
performed for each sample. For each sample, the first principal component
spectrum has been reported in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Principal component analysis of FPA spectra of the six
papyri.
Wavenumber in cm–1. First principal components are
reported. Transmittance are renormalized as centered unitary scale
(−0.5 to 0.5). The scores are in percentage.

The percentage of information carried by each of
these components
lies in the range of 70–80%. This means that information is
well concentrated, dispensing us from the analysis of further principal
components. Interestingly, the most remarkable difference, as already
noted in the visual analysis of Figure 6, has been found between the two Antinoe fragments:
in the region of aliphatic C–H stretching modes, fragment A
plot is relatively flat, whereas fragment A′ presents a large
negative band. This behavior can be attributed to the presence in
A of the previously mentioned organic compounds presenting long alkyl
chains.

On the other hand, also the comparison of the fingerprint
region
between 900 and 1600 cm–1 for the six examined fragments
shows significant differences that can be attributed to a modified
composition in the species having absorption bands in this region,
that is, to a different cellulose/lignin ratio and/or lignin composition.
Hovewer, given the nature of samples, effects due to different initial
compositions and to aging issues are, obiovusly, indistinguishable.

Conclusions
ATR–FTIR imaging and SEM–EDXS,
when applied together,
are able to provide important information to characterize and distinguish
the ancient Egyptian papyri arising from different geographic areas.
In particular, we have shown that chemometric approach applied to
FTIR spectra can reveal subtle differences between fragments that
are not obvious from simple inspection of the spectra. The possibility
to interpret the loading spectra might provide a powerful tool to
evaluate lignin and cellulose constituents.

Furthermore, SEM–EDXS
analysis has shown the presence of
lead in the ink region of one of the fragments, whereas the ATR–FTIR
imaging has evidenced the presence in the same region of organic compounds
characterized by long alkyl chains, suggesting a peculiar ink composition.

Methods
Papyri Fragments
The six papyrus fragments came from
three different sites but in two distinct excavation campaigns during
the first half of the 20th century, thanks to Societá Italiana
per la ricerca dei papiri greci e latini in Egitto. The first site
is Antinoupolis, an important city founded by the emperor Hadrian
in 130 CE on the east bank of the Nile, about 300 km south of Cairo.
Papyri from this site dated with certitude on the base of contents
range from the 2nd to the 8th century CE. The second site is represented
by Tebtynis, a village in the south part of the Fayyum region (ancient
Arsinoite district). The excavations of this site by the Florentine
mission were focused on the sanctuary of the crocodile god. The already
studied fragments from this site range from the 2nd century BC to
the beginning of the 3rd century CE. The last samples come from Oxyrhynchus,
a city in Middle Egypt built on the West branch of the Nile called
Bahr Jussuf (the canal of Joseph), about 160 km south of Cairo. Datable
papyri from this site range mostly from the 1st to the 6th century
AD.

All the papyri were subjected to FTIR analysis without any
kind of preparation of the samples. Only a gentle drying procedure
was done, in order to remove water. This was possible at a temperature
of 70 °C under vacuum in a period of 24 h.

FTIR Analysis
In the macro-ATR study, each sample was
analyzed thanks to a Cary 660 FTIR spectrometer with a ZnSe crystal
and a DLaTGS detector in the range from 4000 to 500 cm–1, with 32 scans both for background and samples, with a resolution
of 4 cm–1. FTIR spectroscopic imaging was conducted
using an Agilent Cary 620 microscope coupled to the Cary 660 spectrometer
in mosaic mode with a 4 × 2 image tiles and a 64 × 64 Focal
Plane Array (FPA) detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. In this case,
each image pixel corresponds to a unique infrared spectrum, which
allows the determination of chemical composition in an area of 5.5
μm2. The spectral range was from 3000 to 900 cm–1, with 256 scans both for background and for sample,
with a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1. In this last
case, samples were subjected to a drying procedure in order to remove
water at a temperature of 70 °C and under vacuum for 24 h before
the analysis.

The Fourier transformation was conducted using
Agilent Resolution Pro software.

SEM-EDX Analysis
SEM images were acquired on papyri
using a FEI Quanta 450 ESEM FEG from Bruker. Typical imaging conditions
were: magnification 130–180×, horizontal field width 3.19–1.48
mm, working distance 10.3 mm, HV 15.00 kV, and pressure 90 Pa.

PCA Analysis
Due to the very large amount of data that
does not permit the use of statistical packages like R, a FORTRAN
program has been written. BLAS and LAPACK standard routines for matrix
handling and transformations have been used.
