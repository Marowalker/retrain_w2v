There
is a growing appreciation that engineered biointerfaces can
regulate cell behaviors, or functions. Most systems aim to mimic the
cell-friendly extracellular matrix environment and incorporate protein
ligands; however, the understanding of how a ligand-free system can
achieve this is limited. Cell scaffold materials comprised of interfused
chitosan–cellulose hydrogels promote cell attachment in ligand-free
systems, and we demonstrate the role of cellulose molecular weight,
MW, and chitosan content and MW in controlling material properties
and thus regulating cell attachment. Semi-interpenetrating network
(SIPN) gels, generated from cellulose/ionic liquid/cosolvent solutions,
using chitosan solutions as phase inversion solvents, were stable
and obviated the need for chemical coupling. Interface properties,
including surface zeta-potential, dielectric constant, surface roughness,
and shear modulus, were modified by varying the chitosan degree of
polymerization and solution concentration, as well as the source of
cellulose, creating a family of cellulose–chitosan SIPN materials.
These features, in turn, affect cell attachment onto the hydrogels
and the utility of this ligand-free approach is extended by forecasting
cell attachment using regression modeling to isolate the effects of
individual parameters in an initially complex system. We demonstrate
that increasing the charge density, and/or shear modulus, of the hydrogel
results in increased cell attachment.

Introduction
The development of
cell scaffolds that successfully mimic the extracellular
matrix, ECM, is paramount if tissue engineering is to prove to be
efficacious. However, the bulk mechanical properties of many synthetic
polymers, although suitable for osseous tissue, are not suitable for
soft tissues, such as muscle or nerve tissues, because the physical
properties, such as the tensile strength, are not matched.1−3 The use of ECM and ECM-derived proteins also have associated problems:
scaffolds require well-defined microenvironments in which animal byproducts
and contaminants are limited, which is difficult to guarantee with
animal-derived scaffold materials, and ECM-based scaffolds are often
complex, with poorly defined compositions.4

To address these problems, alternative biopolymers that mimic
the
properties of the ECM have been sought. One area of focus is the use
of plant-, algae-, and fungi-derived polysaccharides to mimic the
physical and chemical properties of hyaluronan (the only naturally
occuring glycosaminoglycan that is not sulfated, or bound to a protein-based
core to form a proteoglycan), which is known to be involved in the
regulation of cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, and motility.5 Blends consisting of chitosan and alginate have
been generated and reported to result in improved cell response over
pure alginate (due to the modified chemical properties) and improved
mechanical properties over pure chitosan.6−8 Alginate, cross-linked
with multivalent cations, provides mechanical strength, whereas chitosan
imparts appropriate chemical functionality to the material. However,
alginate consists of homopolymeric blocks of two epimers in an arrangement
that cannot be controlled, and only one of the epimers is involved
in cross-linking with the multivalent cations.9 Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that the mechanical properties
of the scaffold will show batch-to-batch consistency, which could
prove challenging at a commercial level. As an alternative to alginate,
cellulose has been investigated, with cellulose–chitosan composites
generated following codissolution of the polysaccharides in ionic
liquids.10−13 However, discoloration of the composites was reported using the
current methodology,10 indicating the degradation
of one of the polymers, or a (currently unidentified) side-reaction.

Successful scaffold design requires an understanding of cell response
to the interdependent material properties. It has previously been
reported that surface charge,14−16 tensile strength,17−20 and surface topography21−25 affect cell response to a scaffold. Despite this, for the majority
of scaffolds reported in the literature, cell response is considered
with respect to (i) one variable, ignoring others, or assuming that
these are constant;14,16,20,22 or (ii) two or more variables, but without
robust testing of their independence, or determination of individual
effects on cell response.8,15,26 Design of experiments, DoE, based on regression modeling, may be
utilized to enable the effect of individual characteristics to be
discerned in a complex system, even where responses to changes in
individual variables are not independent of each other. However, use
of DoE in tissue engineering has been limited and primarily focused
on the response of cells to multiligand systems,27,28 or to elastic modulus and ligand concentration.29,30

Here, we report on the generation of cellulose–chitosan
scaffolds that enable cell attachment comparable to that on tissue
culture plate (polystyrene) (TCP) under ligand-free conditions.
We use regression modeling to decouple the effects of scaffold surface
charge, surface topography, and mechanical properties on cell attachment.
We avoid the reductionist, one variable at a time, approach, which
can result in the oversimplification of complex systems, potentially
resulting in missed interdependence, thus enabling understanding of
the interaction between properties of the surface that, upon cell
attachment, becomes the cell/scaffold interface, allowing scaffolds
to be designed to maximize cell attachment.

Results and Discussion
The generation of a cellulose–chitosan hydrogel by phase
inversion of cellulose dissolved in an organic electrolyte solution
(OES) comprised of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [EMIm][OAc],
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a chitosan solution (Figure 1A) enables the production of
SIPN hydrogels (thickness: 200 μm), without the degradation
of either polymer. Two different sources of cellulose, i.e., plant
α-cellulose, AC, and bacterial α-cellulose, BC, are tested,
as these are known to provide cellulose polymers with a 10-fold difference
in the degree of polymerization. Cell attachment (MG-63 cells) comparable
to that on TCP is achieved even in the absence of a fetal bovine serum,
FBS, usually added to provide complex protein ligands.

is increased by increasing the chitosan solution concentration from
0.12 to 2.1 wt % (xxxL vs xxxH), and decreasing the chitosan molecular
weight from 109 to 26 kDa (xxMx vs xxLx). No significant difference
is observed between plant α-cellulose, AC, and bacterial α-cellulose,
BC, samples. Error ± SE, N = 3. † p < 0.001 compared to ACML; ‡ p < 0.001 compared to ACLH; ○ p < 0.01

ACLH. (D) Confocal image of BCLL demonstrating the presence of chitosan
layer (brighter, blue region) at the surface of the cellulose hydrogel
(darker, green region). Scale bar 50 μm.

To prove the presence of chitosan within the six hydrogels
(Table 1) and investigate
its penetration, three techniques are employed: Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ninhydrin adsorption, and confocal microscopy.
Deconvolution of the FTIR spectrum in the fingerprint region (1400–1800
cm–1) and comparison with the spectra of pure cellulose
and chitosan indicates that the hydrogels contain both cellulose and
chitosan (Figure 1B).
The free chitosan loading is determined via ninhydrin adsorption,
and no significant difference is observed between samples prepared
from AC or BC (Figure 1C). Confocal microscopy reveals a chitosan-rich region at the surface
of the hydrogel, i.e., chitosan is not homogeneously distributed throughout
the cast film. For the AC samples, increasing the chitosan solution
concentration, and decreasing the chitosan MW, results in an increase
in the chitosan penetration (Figure 1D, Table 2). By decreasing the chitosan MW, an increase in chitosan loading
and penetration is observed due to the lower MW chitosan being able
to access a greater proportion of hydrogel pores, as previously determined
using variable-sized biomolecule probes.31 Differences in the pore structure previously observed between AC
and BC hydrogels may account for differences in the chitosan penetration
between the two.31 Although swelling studies
are not considered here given that the hydrogels are never dried,
a previous study by Liu and Huang suggests that the low chitosan content
will not impact the swelling of the hydrogel.13

a Increased penetration is observed
at higher chitosan solution concentrations, and decreased molecular
weight. Error ± stack depth.

This novel methodology enables the production of SIPN
scaffolds,
as defined by Alemán et al.32 The
highly dispersed chitosan (the autofluorescent signal of which dominates
up to 30% of the scaffold, yet accounts for less than 1.5 wt % of
the biopolymer dry material) with a gradated composition (Figure S3) indicates the penetration of chitosan
within the previously characterized, highly porous cellulose network.31 This provides opportunities for use in applications
where this would be beneficial, such as membranes that require the
material properties of cellulose and the functionality of chitosan.
The dissolution of chitosan from the hydrogels upon exposure to acid
solutions during ninhydrin adsorption experiments confirms that the
polymers are not chemically cross-linked to each other. We therefore
expect the hydrogels to be fully biodegradable when exposed to
cellulases and chitinases.

As the goal is to fabricate scaffolds
that would not require addition
of animal-derived proteinaceous ligands, cell attachment in both the
presence and absence of FBS is tested. No significant difference is
observed between cell attachment in the serum (i.e., protein) positive
and negative media for the majority of the hydrogels (Figure 2A). This demonstrates that
the cells do not require ligands to mediate the cell–material
interface, leading to protein- and serum-free cell attachment. To
establish that the cells are binding directly to the hydrogels, pluronic
F-127 is used to block nonspecific binding on TCP and selected hydrogels
under FBS-negative conditions (Figure 2B). Although a significant decrease is observed on
TCP, no significant difference is observed on the cellulose–chitosan
hydrogels, confirming that the cells are interacting with the hydrogel
surface in a specific manner. Comparison of the hydrogels and TCP
under FBS-negative conditions established that ACLL and ACML are not
significantly different from TCP whereas ACLH and BCLL are not significantly
different from AC (Figure 2C). This indicates that there are differences in the physicochemical
cell–material interfacial properties of the hydrogels, affecting
cell attachment. Cell morphologies are considered after 24 h in FBS-positive
media, and the analysis is included in the Supporting Information
(Figures S4–S7).

was performed in FBS+ (gray bars) and fetal bovine serum negative

hydrogels, indicating that they are suitable for ligand-free cell
attachment. Error ± SE, N = 3. (B) Comparison

and ACMH, and modified using pluronic F-127 to block nonspecific cell

in the properties of the hydrogels. Error ± SE, N = 3. * p < 0.05; ** p <
0.01; *** p < 0.001.

To determine the cause of differences in cell attachment
between
the hydrogels, four properties are measured: surface zeta-potential,
ζ, which is proportional to the total surface charge; capacitive
coupling, dC/dz, which is proportional
to the dielectric constant, a measure of polarizability; shear modulus, G, an indicator of the mechanical properties of the hydrogel;
and surface root mean square roughness, Rq, an indicator of the surface morphology. The incorporation of chitosan
into the hydrogel results in an increase in both ζ (Figure 3A) and dC/dz (Figure 3B) compared to native cellulose, reflecting the pKa of chitosan (6.2–6.5),33 which leads to protonation of approximately 10% of the amine groups
at pH 7.4. A statistically significant increase in G is observed for
ACxL hydrogels (Figure 3C), whereas the xxLx samples are significantly more rough than the
other hydrogels (Figure 3D).

of chitosan results in an increase in ζ compared to pure cellulose.

3.

Cell attachment on the ACxL hydrogels
is not significantly different
from TCP (Figure 2C),
suggesting that G is critical in determining the
extent of cell attachment; G for ACxL hydrogels are
significantly different to the other hydrogel samples (Figure 3C). The promotion of cell attachment
with an increase in G is in agreement with previous
reports.18,19 However, despite G for
ACxH samples being greater than the values for the BCxx samples (Figure 3C), no difference
in cell attachment is discerned (Figure 2C). To understand this, other factors are
considered: Rq is significantly different
for the ACLH and BCLL samples (Figure 3D), suggesting that an increase in Rq negatively impacts cell attachment. The effects of ζ
and dC/dz on cell attachment are
not immediately obvious from direct comparison.

To untangle
the effects of each of the individual properties on
the resulting cell attachment, multivariate regression modeling, using
a “leave-one-out” methodology is employed. All of the
possible models containing four- or five-terms are investigated. Interaction
terms between two of the properties are included. Average constant
values and three coefficients of determination (R2, Q2, and MV) are calculated,
model validity is determined, and selected models are optimized, as
detailed in the Experimental Section.

The four-term model with the additional interaction term ζ2, and without dC/dz, is
determined to be the optimal model to describe cell attachment to
the cellulose–chitosan hydrogels under protein-free conditions; R2 = 0.88, Q2 = 0.90,
and MV = 0.93 (Figure 4A,B, Table S2). The generation of a three-dimensional
contour plot (Figure 4C) enables the effect of each property on cell attachment to be determined.
An increase in G promotes the MG63 cell attachment,
as previously reported for stromal and hematopoietic cell lines.18,19 An increase in Rq results in a decrease
in cell attachment, in contrast to previous reports, in which the
authors suggested that an increase in Rq promotes cell attachment.22,23 Notably, these reports
focus on ligand-positive systems, where increasing the hydrophobicity
of the material, influenced by the surface topography, increases ligand
binding to the scaffold and, therefore, the attachment of cells, which
interact directly with the ligands.34 Indeed,
this is observed here with the two scaffolds that are significantly
more rough than the others; both ACLH and BCLL show a significant
increase in cell attachment in the presence of FBS (Figure 2A). Given the scale over which
the roughness changes, it is hypothesized that there is a trade-off
between the number of adhesion points that a cell can access (presumed
to increase initially with Rq as the surface
area will also increase) against the size of the adhesion points between
cell and substrate, which are directly proportional to the force that
a cell can exert on a substrate.35 It has
previously been demonstrated that the percentage of cells that remain
attached after centrifugation increases with initial cell attachment.22,36 Therefore, as Rq increases, the binding
force between the cells and scaffold decreases, resulting in poorer
cell attachment.

generated using the four-term model. Cell attachment increases as
colored bands change from red to green. Relative positions of hydrogels
investigated are included. The model suggests that cell attachment
increases with increasing ζ and G, which is
expected from the literature. Increasing Rq, within the bounds of the system investigated, results in a decrease
in cell attachment.

As ζ increases,
the cell attachment also increases. Consideration
of the earlier studies on the hydrogels modified using pluronic F-127
(Figure 2B), whereby
the blocking of nonspecific binding did not affect the cell attachment
to the hydrogels, suggests that the cells are binding directly to
the amine groups, which can exhibit a positive charge (as ammonium
groups, −NH3+). Thus, cell attachment
appears to be directly proportional to the number of amine groups
available at the hydrogel surface.

Conclusions
To
conclude, the regeneration of cellulose hydrogels from organic
electrolyte solutions, using a chitosan solution to achieve phase
inversion, enabled the generation of robust, semi-interpenetrating
network chitosan–cellulose hydrogels without the need for chemical
cross-linkers. The presence of the chitosan in the hydrogel scaffold
enabled cell attachment in protein-free growth media, with cell attachment
to the plant α-cellulose with low concentrations of low molecular
weight chitosan hydrogel improved by 3000% compared to pure plant
α-cellulose after 90 min. The physicochemical cell–material
interfacial properties (surface ζ potential, capacitive coupling,
surface roughness, and shear modulus) were modified by varying the
cellulose and chitosan degree of polymerization, and chitosan solution
concentration (used in phase inversion). This, in turn, affected cell
attachment on the hydrogels.

The use of regression modeling
enabled the effects of individual
parameters to be discerned in an initially complex system, and allowed
further development of an understanding of the interaction between
cells and their surrounding environment. The developed regression
model indicated that an increase in the shear modulus and surface
charge, i.e., number of amine groups, and a decrease in the surface
roughness were beneficial for MG63 cell attachment within the bounds
of the experimental data.

Thus, it is demonstrated that a readily
applied procedure for deconvoluting
the effect of changes in individual material characteristics on cell
attachment allows the importance of specific characteristics to be
discerned, thus enabling rational design of these readily fabricated
tissue scaffold materials, prepared from natural biopolymers available
from nonanimal sources, which promote cell attachment even under ligand-free
conditions.

Experimental Section
Materials
1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate ([EMIm][OAc]),
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chitosan (low MW and medium MW), plant
α-cellulose, acetic acid, glucose, yeast extract, peptone, anhydrous
disodium phosphate, citric acid monohydrate, acetate buffer, sodium
acetate, ninhydrin, hydrindantin, 2-methoxyethanol, phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), polystyrene latex particles, Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate,
nonessential amino acids (NEAA), penicillin streptomycin (pen strep),
formalin, and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fluorescein
phalloidin (FITC), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Plant α-cellulose
and [EMIm][OAc] were dried at 60 °C en vacuo overnight; and DMSO
dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves before use.

Bacterial
Cellulose Production
Cellulose-producing
bacteria from Acetobacter culture were grown in the laboratory at
25 °C in deionized water (DI) supplemented with 2 wt % glucose,
0.5 wt % yeast extract, 0.5 wt % peptone, 0.27 wt % anhydrous disodium
phosphate, and 0.15 wt % citric acid monohydrate. The resulting cellulose
pellicle was treated with a solution of 10 wt % sodium hypochlorite
for 1 h before being washed three times with copious amounts of distilled
water and lyophilized.

Hydrogel Generation
Hydrogel codes
consisting of four
letters (xxxx) were generated based on the choice of cellulose (first
two letters); chitosan MW (third letter); and chitosan solution concentration
(final letter) as detailed below, and in Table 1.

Cellulose solutions (4 wt %) were
prepared in an organic electrolyte solution (OES), consisting of 30:70
(wt %) [EMIm][OAc]/DMSO. For example, for a total of 12.000 g of OES/cellulose
solution, 8.064 g DMSO was measured into a vial and 0.480 g α-cellulose
(plant, ACxx, or bacterial, BCxx) was added to this and briefly shaken;
3.456 g [EMIm][OAc] was added to the solution, and the mixture agitated
on a roller table at ambient temperature overnight, to ensure the
complete dissolution of cellulose.

Chitosan solutions (0.12,
xxxL, or 2.1 wt %, xxxH; 26, xxLx, or
109 kDa, xxMx) were prepared in 0.43 M acetic acid aqueous solutions.

To generate the hydrogel, cellulose solutions were tape cast using
an Elcometer 4340 Automatic Film Applicator with 500 μm between
the blade and the glass surface. The resulting film, limited only
by the size of the applicator bed, was regenerated by immersion for
20 min in the chosen chitosan solution and washed twice with copious
amounts of DI H2O to remove excess solvent. The resulting
hydrogel films were stored in a 20 vol % MeOH aqueous solution to
inhibit bacterial growth. For tissue scaffolds based on polysaccharides
to be useful, these materials must remain intact in storage. These
films proved to be stable throughout the period of experimentation,
lasting over one year with no significant differences in cell attachment
noted in experiments conducted 12 months apart.

Chitosan Film
Generation
Chitosan (2.1 wt %, low, or
medium, MW) was dissolved in 0.43 M aqueous acetic acid. These solutions
were then poured into a Petri dish and liquid evaporated at 60 °C.
The resulting films were washed with DI H2O before being
re-dried.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR
spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Frontier FTIR spectrometer
in the attenuated total reflection mode between 600 and 4000 cm–1 using 10 scans with a resolution of 1 cm–1. The curve-fitting software Fityk was used to deconvolute the raw
FTIR data by fitting Gaussian curves to the peaks present in the spectra.37 Original data are presented in Figure S2.

Chitosan Content Determination
The
percentage of free
chitosan in the regenerated hydrogels was measured using a method
modified from that reported by Tan et al. for determining the chitosan
degree of deacetylation using ultraviolet–vis (UV–vis)spectroscopy.38 Solutions of low- and medium-MW chitosan (1
mg mL–1) were prepared by dissolving the polymer
in 0.43 M acetic acid aqueous solution. Calibration solutions (0–200
μg mL–1) were then generated, consisting of
2 mL ninhydrin reagent solution (0.5 mL acetic buffer, 1.5 mL 2-methoxyethanol,
40 mg ninhydrin, 6 mg hydrindantin), 0.5 mL acetic buffer, and 0.5
mL chitosan solution diluted to the required concentration with DI
H2O. The resulting solutions were heated (water bath) at
100 °C for 15 min before being allowed to cool, diluted to 0–20
μg mL–1 with DI H2O, and calibration
curves, linking chitosan concentration to UV–vis absorbance
at 570 nm, generated using an Agilent Cary 100 UV–vis spectrometer.

To determine the chitosan content in the hydrogels, 20 mg of lyophilized
material was added to 20 mL 0.43 M aqueous acetic acid and sonicated
(sonication bath, 30 min, 37 Hz, 50 °C). Experimental solutions
(2 mL ninhydrin reagent solution, 0.5 mL acetic buffer, 0.5 mL hydrogel
solution) were diluted 10-fold and UV–vis absorbance measured
in triplicate. The chitosan concentration was determined from the
calibration curve, enabling the chitosan weight percentage in the
hydrogel to be ascertained.

Confocal Microscopy
Pöhlker
et al. reported
that cellulose and chitosan autofluoresced with different emission
wavelength maxima at 420 and 410 nm under excitation at 335 nm.39 Based on this, 32-emission channel hydrogel
z-stack fluorescence spectra were taken using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal
microscope. Images were obtained using a 405 nm diode laser with a
Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.28 M27 objective. An MBS-405 filter was
used for the invisible light detector. The maximum distance between
slices was 3.6 μm, with a minimum of 20 slices recorded. Hydrogel
samples were placed between a glass slide and coverslip to ensure
a flat surface. Comparison of the intensity at 443 and 478 nm was
used to determine whether chitosan or cellulose was dominant for each
slice, enabling the determination of the thickness of the chitosan
dominant region at the surface of the hydrogel (Table 2, Figure S3).

Surface ζ Potential
The ζ of the hydrogels
were established using a Malvern Zetasizer Surface ζ Potential
Cell. An aqueous suspension of polystyrene latex particles (diameter:
0.3 μm) in PBS (pH 7.4) was used as the tracer solution. Five
measurements, consisting of 15 repeats each, were performed for each
distance for each hydrogel.

Atomic Force Microscopy
Shear moduli
were determined
by AFM as previously described by Bae et al.40,41 Hydrogels were placed in a 35 mm plastic dish, immobilized with
vacuum grease, and submerged in 3 mL PBS. A DAFM-2X BioScope AFM system
(Bruker) in force mode was applied to measure the shear modulus of
the hydrogels. The hydrogels were indented with a silicon nitride
cantilever (spring constant: 0.06 N m–1) with a
conical tip (40 nm in diameter); 8 to 10 measurements of each hydrogel
were collected and analyzed per condition. To calculate the shear
modulus, the first 600 nm of tip deflection from the horizontal was
fitted with the Hertz model for a cone.42 The data were analyzed using custom-built MATLAB scripts.

Scanning

Hydrogel samples were flash
frozen and dried using a mini lyotrap freeze dryer (LTE Scientific).

were obtained using a NX-10 Atomic Force Microscope (Park System)
in an intermittent contact mode.43 PPP-EFM
probes (NanoWorld) were used for measurements (spring constant: 2.8
N m–1, resonance frequency: 75 kHz). Hydrogel samples
were fixed onto metal sample stubs using a double-sided adhesive tape
and topography and electrical images acquired in air by a single-pass
scanning (ambient temperature, humidity 0–5%). Analysis and
processing of the AFM images were carried out with Gwyddion.44 The hydrogel dC/dz signal distribution was calculated from LockIn3 Amplitude data file
using the one-dimensional height analysis function, and the surface
roughness from the flattened height data file using the roughness
parameter function.

Cell Attachment
Hydrogel samples
were prepared from
the generated sheets using a 10 mm hole punch, generating circles
that fitted snugly into 48-well tissue culture treated plates (Costar).
The samples were washed twice under sterile conditions with PBS before
being stored in 1 mL PBS overnight at 4 °C. For the nonspecific
blocking studies, 0.5 mL 0.5 wt % pluronic F-127 in PBS was preadsorbed
onto the samples for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS.

For
cell attachment studies, the PBS was removed under sterile conditions,
and the scaffolds were seeded with MG63 cells (20 000 cells
cm–2) with a total of 0.25 mL protein positive,
or negative, growth media (protein positive: 87% DMEM, 10% FBS, 1%
NEAA, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% pen strep; protein negative: 97% DMEM,
1% NEAA, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% pen strep). Empty wells were seeded
with either protein positive, or negative, cell-containing media for
controls. The samples were incubated (90 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2) before fixation (3.7% formaldehyde, 15 min, room temperature
(RT)). The samples were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,
DAPI, (0.2 ng mL–1, 5 min, RT) before being stored
in PBS. Under low light levels, each sample was removed from its well
and placed cell-side down on a glass microscope slide for viewing
with an EVOS FL digital inverted microscope (objective: 10× Fl,
excitation: 357 nm, emission: 447 nm). At least three images were
acquired per sample repeat, and at least six repeat analyses were
performed per sample. Triplicate tests were conducted using separate
MG63 cell passages. The cell attachment on each hydrogel relative
to the control (protein positive media, tissue culture treated plate)
was determined by comparing the average number of cells imaged on
each.

Statistics
IBM SPSS Statistics software was used for
statistical analysis. For cell attachment and spreading studies, and
hydrogel physiochemical properties, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test was used to determine the statistical differences between
the means of two or more samples, assuming equal variance, with a
Tukey posthoc comparison. The statistical differences between cell
aspect ratio distributions were determined using the Kruskal–Wallis
one-way ANOVA test. The differences were considered significant at
the levels of p < 0.001, p <
0.01, and p < 0.05 with a confidence level of
0.95.

Regression Model
To ensure that the data were suitable
for analysis, a normal probability plot for cell attachment was produced
(Figure S4). The samples were ordered in
increasing value and assigned an increasing corresponding number,
one being assigned to the lowest value. The “z value”, determined from the assigned number using the inverse
of the standard normal cumulative distribution, was plotted against
the sample standard deviation. If the line of best fit for the data
set passed through (0,0) and had a high coefficient of determination,
the model was deemed suitable for analysis.

Development of the
regression model to predict cell attachment was performed using Excel
with the solver add-in enabled. Constants were calculated using the
solver function in Microsoft Excel using the GRG nonlinear solving
method.45 Both the sum of the differences
between the model and real values, and the sum of the squared differences
were minimized. For each potential model, a cross-validation (leave-one-out)
methodology was employed: one result was omitted from the model before
fitting. The coefficient of determination, R2, was calculated from the six included results only, comparing
the predicted value to the actual value, and the constants recorded.
This was repeated six times further, suppressing each result in turn.46 The average R2 and
constant values were calculated from the seven values generated. Two
further coefficients of determination were calculated based on the
averaged constant values: (i) Q2 calculated
from all of the seven results, comparing the predicted value to the
actual value; and (ii) MV for the line of best fit for a plot of predicted
values versus actual values for all of the seven results. To be designated
as valid, the models had to meet four criteria: (i) Q2 > 0.5; (ii) R2 – Q2 < 0.2; (iii) MV > 0.25; and (iv) the
SE
for each constant had to be less than the average constant value (Table S1).47,48

The optimal model
was determined using four additional criteria
to penalize the models: (i) 0.5/Q2; (ii)
(R2 – Q2)/0.2; (iii) 0.25/MV; and (iv) (number of terms)/6. The model with
the lowest sum from these criteria was chosen to be optimal (Table S2).
