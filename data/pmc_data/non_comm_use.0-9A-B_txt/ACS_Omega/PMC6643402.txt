Single-component tunable Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphors
were successfully synthesized at 950 °C. Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+ exhibits two luminescence peaking at 430 and 550 nm, which originated
from the allowed 5d → 4f transition of the Ce3+ ion
and the 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transition of
the Tb3+ ion, respectively. Moreover, by codoping Ce3+ ions in the Li2Ca4Si4O13:Mn2+ system, yellow-red emission from the forbidden
transition of Mn2+ could be enhanced. Under UV excitation,
dual energy transfers (ETs), namely, Ce3+ → Mn2+ and Ce3+ → Tb3+, are present
in the Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ system. The ET process was
confirmed by the overlap of the excitation spectra, variations in
the emission spectra, ET efficiency, and decay times of phosphors.
In addition, quantum yields and CIE chromatic coordinates are presented.
The emission color of these phosphors can be tuned precisely from
blue to green via ET of Ce3+ → Tb3+ and
from blue to yellow via ET of Ce3+ → Mn2+. White light can also be achieved upon excitation of UV light by
properly tuning the relative composition of Tb3+/Mn2+. This result indicates that the developed phosphor may be
regarded as a good tunable emitting phosphor for UV light-emitting
diodes.

1 Introduction
White light–emitting
diode (w-LED), because of its highly
efficient luminance, long service life, improved performance, and
environment-friendly properties, has gained considerable attention
in order to address global energy shortage.1−5 In the generation of white light with LED chips,
basically two methods are used. The first method is by mixing red,
green, and blue (RGB) lights emitted by different LED chips, which,
because of the required complex electro-optical design to control
different colors, is seldom used. The second method is by using UV
or blue LED chips and down-converting phosphors.6−8 To circumvent
the disadvantages of these approaches, researchers have focused on
investigating single-phased phosphors with RGB components, which could
emit white light during energy transfer (ET) between activators in
an efficient and durable way and with excellent color-rendering indices.
Thus, in order to avoid high cost, device complication, and intrinsic
color balance in the use of multiple-emitting components, it is crucial
to find new single-component and UV chip pumped phosphors for w-LED.

Different emission colors can be obtained with single-phased phosphors
by codoping ion pairs through ET, which was investigated extensively
for the pairs of Ce3+ and Mn2+ or Tb3+ among single-component lattices. Li et al. reported on a color-tuning
luminescence of Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2:Ce3+/Mn2+/Tb3+ via
ET,9 whereas Huang and Chen described a
single-composition Ca3Y(GaO)3(BO3)4:Ce3+,Mn2+,Tb3+ phosphor
for UV-LEDs.10 Then, again, Zhang et al.
investigated the ET from Ce3+ to Tb3+ and Ce3+ to Mn2+ in Ca3Gd7(PO4)(SiO4)5O2 host,11 and Lü et al. reported some results on
the spectral properties and ET of a color-tunable CaScAlSiO6:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphor.12 Single-composition trichromatic Sr3.5Y6.5O2(PO4)(1.5)(SiO4)4.5:Ce3+/Tb3+/Mn2+ and NaCaBO3:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphors via ET are also reported by Liu and Zhang et al.13,14 Recently, other researchers have also suggested the ET mechanism
in proper single-host lattices, such as Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ and Ca9ZnK(PO4)7:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+, indicating that the obtained
samples may be a promising candidate for UV-convertible devices.15−18 In these systems, for either Mn2+ or Tb3+ ions,
because of their prohibited 4T1 → 6A1 transition and 4f–4f weak absorption,
respectively, both have weak emissions.15,16 However, in
codoping of Ce3+ with the allowed transition as sensitizer,
ET will occur from Ce3+ to Mn2+ or Tb3+, which allows for efficient emission of Mn2+ and Tb3+ ions and tunability of the emission colors from blue to
orange/red and green, respectively. This feature was used in the development
of new tridoped phosphors.19−30

In this paper, we report our recent results on the photoluminescence
(PL) properties and the ET mechanism of Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphor. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been
conducted on Ce3+/Tb3+/Mn2+ codoped
in the Li2Ca4Si4O13 host.
We generated green/yellow/white lights with high color stabilities
using Tb3+ and Mn2+ at different relative dopant
concentrations. Additionally, we systematically investigated the mechanisms
of ET from Ce3+ to Tb3+ or Mn2+ and
their decay times.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction
We collected and
used X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns to study the samples in order
to identify their compositions and phase purities. The representative
XRD patterns for LCSO, LCSO:Ce3+,Tb3+, LCSO:Ce3+,Mn2+, and LCSO:xCe3+,yTb3+,zMn2+ samples are showed in Figure 1. The selected samples have pure phases, and their XRD patterns
exactly originate from the pure tetragonal phase of Li2Ca4Si4O13 according to JCPDS file
no. 31-0714. No other phase was detected, which indicates that all
of the Mn2+, Tb3+, and Ce3+ ions
are dissolved in Li2Ca4Si4O13.

2.2 Luminescence Properties of LCSO:Ce3+ and ET of LCSO:Ce3+,Tb3+
Both PL
excitation (PLE) and PL spectra for as-prepared LCSO:xCe3+ samples are shown in Figure 2a. Three distinctive bands peaked at 259,
296, and 353 nm (the strongest) were found spanning a broad absorption
from 200 to 400 nm for the PLE spectrum monitored at 420 nm. These
peaks are caused by transitions to 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 state from the lowest 5d state because of
spin–orbit coupling. The PL spectrum extends from 400 to 550
nm and peaks at 450 nm, caused by the 5d → 4f transitions from
Ce3+. Figure 2b shows the concentration dependence of the emitting intensities
of LCSO:xCe3+ with various Ce3+ concentrations. After excitation at 330 nm, the emitting intensities
increase with Ce3+ ion contents until the highest point x = 0.04, after which the intensities decline because of
concentration quench. Between several excitation bands of Tb3+ and the broad Ce3+ emission band, a significant spectral
overlap is observed in Figure 3. Because of transitions from 5D4 → 7F5, a main emission line and well-known green fluorescence
occur in LCSO:0.1Tb3+ at 543 nm. Moreover, several weak
lines appear at 485, 580, and 620 nm, corresponding to 5D4 to 7FJ (J = 3, 4, 5, 6) multiple transitions, respectively. Because
of the prohibited Tb3+ f–f absorbing transitions
in the UV region, LCSO:0.1Tb3+ demonstrates very weak emissions
excited by UV light compared to the PL spectrum of LCSO:0.04Ce3+. An apparent overlap between the Tb3+ PLE and
Ce3+ PL spectra indicates a possible Ce3+–Tb3+ ET in LCSO. The PLE and PL spectra in LCSO:0.04Ce3+,0.1Tb3+ are illustrated in Figure 3c. A profile with similarities to the Ce3+ single-doped samples appears with that of the Ce3+,Tb3+ codoped samples. The Tb3+ emitting intensity
is enormously increased relative to Ce3+ emissions, which
validates a Ce3+–Tb3+ ET.

LCSO:0.04Ce3+ (a), LCSO:0.1Tb3+ (b), and LCSO:0.04Ce3+,0.1Tb3+ (c).

To understand the effect of ET on the luminescent properties
(Figure 4), we studied
PL
spectra dependence on Tb3+ dopant contents for LCSO:0.04Ce3+,yTb3+ phosphors excited by UV
(λex = 330 nm) (y = 0, 0.02, 0.04,
0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12). The PL intensities of Ce3+ decrease
monotonically with increasing Tb3+ concentrations because
of the effective Ce3+–Tb3+ ET. Meanwhile,
those of Tb3+ at 550 nm increase until the y value is above 0.06 when the emission intensities of Tb3+ are saturated. Moreover, the Tb3+ emitting intensities
start to decrease when the Tb3+ dopant content (y) is over 0.06 because of the internal quench of concentrations
of Tb3+–Tb3+.

Figure 4 PL spectra of LCSO:0.04Ce3+,yTb3+ (y =
0–0.12) under 330 nm UV excitation.

The Ce3+ decay curves were measured for the investigation
of the ET processes in LCSO:Ce3+,Tb3+. The Ce3+ decay curves in LCSO:0.04Ce3+,yTb3+ phosphor (y = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06,
0.08, 0.10, 0.12) samples were also collected (Figure 5). The lifetimes can be defined in equation
τD = ∫0∞ID(t)dt, where ID(t) is the decay function of donors in the absence
of acceptors, which have normalized to its initial intensity. The
Ce3+–Tb3+ ET features are reflected by
the fluorescence intensities, which decrease with increasing Tb3+ concentrations.31−33 The efficiency of Ce3+–Tb3+ ET is calculated with the formula 1  where τ0 and τ are
the decay lifetimes of the sensitizer Ce3+ in the absence
and presence of activator Tb3+, respectively. The calculated
value is illustrated in Figure 5, which will increase monotonously with the y values until the highest 45% corresponding to a y value of 0.12.

of the
Tb3+ contents. Inset: The calculated ET efficiency with
different doping Tb3+ contents.

Ce3+ to Tb3+ ET occurs during electric–multipole
interaction and could be determined through spectral overlap method,
as follows, in line with Dexter’s ET expression for multipolar
interactions34−36 2  where I and I0 respectively represent the luminescence intensities
of the samples in the present and absent state of Tb3+,
and C represents total Ce3+ and Tb3+ concentration. The correlation of (I0/I) with Cn/3 with n = 6, 8, and 10 corresponds to a
dipole–dipole, dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole
interaction. The linear fittings of the relationship between Cn/3 and (I0/I) are demonstrated in Figure 6, and a good linear correlation
is obtained at n = 8, indicating a dipole–quadrupole
for Ce3+–Tb3+ ET. According to spectral
overlap theory, RC can be calculated by
the formula 3  where fq represents
oscillator strength in quadrupole transitions, ∫FS(E)FA(E)/E4 dE represents
spectral overlapping among the normalized shape of the Ce3+ emission FS(E) and
the Tb3+ excited FA(E), E (eV) is the energy in the transfer,
and RC (Å) represents the sensitizer–acceptor
average distance. Correspondingly, during the sensitizer’s
emissions, it is approximately 0.0051 eV–5. λS (Å) of the wavelength position. So far, it has not been
obtained for the oscillator strength in Tb3+ quadrupole
transitions (fq). However, Verstegen et
al. suggested that 10–3 to 10–2 is approximately the fq/fd ratio, where fd = 10–6 is the Tb3+ electric dipole transition
strength.36 According to the parameters
mentioned above, RCdq of dipole–quadrupole interactions
is 11.53–15.38 Å.

2.3 Luminescence Properties and ET of LCSO:Ce3+,Mn2+
As a transition metal ion with
3d5 configuration, its position of the broad emitting bands
is largely determined by its host. In LCSO host, the intensity luminescence
of Mn2+ emission is too weak to be detected owing to prohibited
Mn2+ d–d transitions. Thus, the PLE and PL spectra
of a series of Mn2+ and Ce3+ codoped LCSO phosphors
are illustrated in Figure 7. The PLE spectrum of Mn2+ emissions is similar
to that of Ce3+. Thus, Mn2+ ions can be excited
by UV or near-UV light, which strongly verify an effective Ce3+–Mn2+ ET. The effective resonance-type
Ce3+–Mn2+ ET is relatively common and
was observed in several Ce3+ and Mn2+ codoped
phosphors, including Ca3Sc2Si3O12:Ce3+,Mn2+ and Ca9Y(PO4)7:Ce3+,Mn2+.37,38 The PL spectrum demonstrates multicolor emissions consisting of
an orange band excited at 365 nm caused by Mn2+4T1–6A1 transitions and a
blue band caused by Ce3+ f–d transitions, respectively.
Therefore, the red emission in LCSO:Ce3+,Mn2+ phosphors originates from ET from Ce3+ to Mn2+. The detailed PL spectra of the series of LCSO:0.04Ce3+,zMn2+ phosphors are shown in Figure 8, which are excited
by a wavelength of 330 nm, with the z value from
0 to 0.24. With increasing Mn2+ concentration, two broad
bands with emission peaks at 450 and 580 nm are detected. Because
of Ce3+–Mn2+ ET, the emission intensities
of Mn2+ ions increase systematically. Additionally, concentration
quench may induce the decrease in Mn2+ emission intensity.

phosphors excited

In LCSO:0.04Ce3+,zMn2+ (z = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, 0.2, 0.24), the
decay curves
of Ce3+ fluorescence were measured (Figure 9a), which reveals that the Ce3+ lifetime decreases with increased Mn2+ concentrations
and verifies its Ce3+–Mn2+ ET efficiency
(calculated with eq 1; refer to Figure 9b). The efficiency of ET significantly increases, and the maximum
value is approximately 30.4% of Mn2+ concentration at z = 0.24, which clarifies that Ce3+ contributes
to the yellow emission energy of Mn2+. The relationship
of (I0/I) to Cn/3 is shown in Figure 10. Similar to the investigated
and observed results of other research groups, the ET of Ce3+–Mn2+ arises from the dipole–quadrupole
mechanism.39,40

2.4 Quantum Yields and Chromaticity of LCSO:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+
The absolute internal
quantum yield (QY) of the obtained phosphors was measured to explore
the potential of the as-synthesized LCSO:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphors. Upon excitation at 365 nm UV radiation,
the absolute internal QY of LCSO:0.04Ce3+,yTb3+ (y = 0–12%) phosphors are
60.3, 62.1, 64.5, 67.3, 61.7, 55.9, and 47.2%. For LCSO:0.04Ce3+,zMn2+ (z =
0–24%) samples, the absolute internal QY is 65.3, 48.8, 31.6,
27.2, 23.4, 20.9, and 13.1%. The internal QY values decrease obviously
with the increase in Mn2+ concentration, which may be in
relation to two factors: First, the energy should be lost in the Ce3+ → Mn2+ ET process. Second, the internal
quantum efficiency can be expressed as ηin = WR/(WR + WNR), where WR and WNR represent the radiative transition rate and
the nonradiative decay rate, respectively. This suggests that the
nonradiative decay rate is much higher than the radiative decay rate,
leading to low internal quantum efficiency of the Mn2+ ions.
The maximum internal QY in the as-prepared samples can reach 67.3%.
The high QYs of our samples indicate that LCSO functions well to dope
rare-earth ions as a matrix. For LCSO:Ce3+,yTb3+,zMn2+ at varied contents
(y and z), their CIE chromaticity
diagrams is shown in Figure 11. The color point evolves from blue (0.155, 0.112) to white
(0.249, 0.267) by changing the Mn2+ concentrations and
from blue (0.155, 0.112) to green (0.298, 0.524) by changing the content
of Tb3+. The tunable color point results from the ET processes
of Ce3+ → Tb3+ and Ce3+ →
Mn2+, which is deduced from the energy-level model in Figure 12. Upon excitation
at 365 nm, Ce3+ ions can be effectively excited. Then some
Ce3+ ions go back to the ground state of 2F7/2 or 2F5/2 spontaneously by a radiative
process, and other excited Ce3+ ions transfer its energy
to the 5D2/5D3 state of
Tb3+ and 4A1 (4G) state of Mn2+. Finally, Tb3+ and Mn2+ ions will
emit a green and red emission band, respectively. In particular, the
inset in Figure 11 shows a series of digital photos of the selected LCSO:0.04Ce3+,yTb3+,zMn2+ phosphors upon UV lamp excitation at 365 nm. The material
exhibits tunable color emission. LCSO:0.04Ce3+,0.24Mn2+ can emit white light and thus can be used as a single-component
multicolor-emitting phosphor for UV LEDs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized
a series of emission-tunable Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphors
by solid-state reaction.
The ETs from Ce3+ to Tb3+ and from Ce3+ to Mn2+ in Li2Ca4Si4O13 were observed. The ET from Ce3+ to Tb3+ in Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+ phosphors is a resonant type via
the dipole–quadrupole mechanism, and the calculated critical
distance (RC) is 11.53–15.38 Å.
The ET from Ce3+ to Mn2+ was investigated based
on PL and PLE spectra, decay curves, and effect of Ce3+/Mn2+ concentration. Color emission and luminescence internal
QY (13–67%) can be tuned by controlling the contents of Ce3+, Tb3+, and Mn2+. Hence, Li2Ca4Si4O13:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ could be a white light-emitting phosphor
for UV-excited w-LEDs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
Li2Ca4–x–y–zSi4O13:xCe3+,yTb3+,zMn2+ (LCSO:xCe3+,yTb3+,zMn2+) were synthesized
by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts
of starting materials, including CaCO3 (A. R.), Li2CO3 (A. R.), SiO2 (A. R.), CeO2 (99.99%), Tb4O7 (99.99%), and MnCO3 (A. R.), were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar for 0.5 h. The
mixed powders were calcined at 950 °C under a reducing atmosphere
of H2 (5%) and N2 (95%) for 4 h. The samples
were cooled to room temperature to obtain the final products.

4.2 Measurements and Characterization
The structure and
crystallinity of the sample was identified by powder
XRD analysis (Bruker AXS D8, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5405
Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). PL and PLE spectra were collected on a Hitachi
F7000 spectrometer (700 V, 150 W xenon lamp, EX/EM slit of 2.5 nm,
scanning rate of 1200 nm/min). Luminescence decay profiles were obtained
from a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 digital oscilloscope (1 GHz) by using
a tunable laser (pulse width = 4 ns, gate = 50 ns) as the excitation
source (Continuum Sunlite OPO). PL internal QYs were measured by using
the absolute PL QY measurement system (C9920-02, Hamamatsu Photonics
K. K., Japan). All of the measurements were performed at room temperature.
