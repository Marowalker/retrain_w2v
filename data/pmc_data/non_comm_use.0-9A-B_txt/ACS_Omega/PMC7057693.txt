In this work, a new family of fully
biobased thermoplastic polyurethanes
(TPUs) with thermo-induced shape memory is developed. First, a series
of TPUs were successfully synthesized by the one-shot solvent-free
bulk polymerization of bio-poly(1,3-propylene succinate) glycol (PPS)
with various molecular weights (Mn = 1000,
2000, 3000, and 4000), 1,4-butanediol (BDO), and 4,4′-methylene
diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). These polyurethanes (PUs) are denoted
as PPS-x-TPUs (x = 1000, 2000, 3000,
and 4000), where x represents the Mn of PPS in the polymers. To determine the effect of the
molecular weight of the soft segment of PU, all PPS–TPUs were
formed with the same hard segment content (32.5 wt %). The soft segment
with high molecular weight in PPS-4000-TPU caused a high degree of
soft segment entanglement and formed many secondary bonds. PPS-4000-TPU
exhibited better mechanical (tensile strength: 64.13 MPa and hardness:
90A) and thermomechanical properties (maximum loading: 2.95 MPa and
maximum strain: 144%) than PPS-1000-TPU. At an appropriate shape memory
programming temperature, all synthesized PPS-x-TPUs
exhibited excellent shape memory behaviors with a fixed shape rate
of >99% and a shape recovery rate of >86% in the first round
and 95%
in the following rounds. Therefore, these bio-TPUs with shape memory
have potential for use in smart fabrics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays,
significant attention is being paid to the study and
development of “smart” materials or stimulus-responsive
shape memory polymers (SMPs). SMPs reversibly change shape from a
deformed shape to their original shape in response to an externally
imposed stimulus, which may be stress, temperature, light, humidity,
solvent, a change in pH, or an electric or magnetic field.1−5 SMPs have many technical advantages over other shape memory materials
and have an extensive range of applications in high-performance textiles,
biomedical devices, actuators, packing films, heat-shrinkable tubes,
and many others.6−10 Polymers with shape memory behavior must have cross-links at net
points that determine their original shape and switching segments
with a phase transition temperature (Ttrans) that fixes their makeshift shape. The rubber elasticity of the
cross-links that are created by chemical bonds or physical interactions
strongly affects the properties of SMPs and is the key driver of polymer
shape recovery.11,12 Hence, the shape memory behaviors
depend mainly on the microphase separation of the hard and soft segments,
which is determined by molecular properties (the composition of the
hard and soft segments and the molecular weight).

Polyurethanes
(PUs) have been developed as the perfect material
for use in shape memory applications owing to their biocompatibility,
biodegradability (polyester-based), and easy tuning of their structural
properties and Ttrans by manipulating
their segmental composition.13,14 Specifically, shape
memory PUs (SMPUs) that are formed from renewable monomers have attracted
a great deal of interest because of their technological advantages
over petrochemical-based PUs with regard to sustainability, biocompatibility,
and environmental friendliness.15,16 Recently, most bio-SMPUs
have included natural oil-based polyols as their soft segment, and
many research groups have synthesized some plant oil-based bio-SMPUs.17 Remarkably, biopolyols that are derived from
biobased 1,3-propanediol (PDO) monomers seem to be more attractive
because of their affordability because PDO is manufactured from renewable
resources.18 Notably, all renewably sourced
poly(1,3-propylene succinate) glycols (PPS polyols) that are derived
from cornstalk-based PDO and succinic acid have been commercialized
by Tai Chin Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.

PPS polyols are entirely
biobased polyester-based (polyethylene
terephthalate-based) polyols and have well-known advantages of biodegradability,
biocompatibility, and transparency.19−21 The development or application
of conventional organic solvent-based SMPUs involves the acute emission
of volatile organic compounds, so ecofriendly and biobased SMPUs that
are not associated with the emission of volatile organic compounds
have been developed in response to an increasing awareness of conservational
degradation and the need for environmental protection. The solvent-free
synthesis of thermoplastic PUs (TPUs) has been less studied than the
synthesis of solvent-based PUs and waterborne PUs.22 In particular, the synthesis of thermal-responsive shape
memory solvent-free bio-PPS-based TPUs by one-shot polymerization
has never been discussed. Prominently, one-shot polymerization is
commonly used as an industrial application. Solvent-free and one-shot
polymerization synthesis of TPUs has substantial theoretical and practical
value. TPU is a class of PU that is synthesized using polyols as the
soft segment, chain extenders, and diisocyanate as the hard segments.23,24 TPUs have various applications, including those in biomedical devices,
drug carriers, tissue engineering scaffolds, anti-biofouling, and
insulation. Nonetheless, the high flammability of TPUs and its ability
to create large quantities of toxic gases and smoke during its combustion
restrict its widespread application in some aforementioned fields.
However, the aromatic backbone improves the thermal stability and
char formation of TPUs [TPUs based on 4,4′-methylene diphenyl
diisocyanate (MDI)] and reduces smoke production compared to aliphatic
TPUs [TPUs based on hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and pentamethylene
diisocyanate (PDMI)]. This is because HDI and PDMI are more volatile
and can cause lung injury. Rather, MDI is more stable than both owing
to its aromatic structure.25 In addition,
several studies have been published on the development of biodegradable
TPUs with diverse properties despite the fact that SMPUs based on
renewable bio-PPS polyols are rare.

For the abovementioned reasons,
this study focuses on the solvent-free
one-shot synthesis of thermally activated shape memory TPUs (SMTPUs),
PPS-x-TPUs, from 100% renewably resourced PPS polyols
(Mn = 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000), 1,4-butanediol
(BDO), and MDI. The hard segment content was fixed to observe the
effect of the soft segment content on shape memory behavior. A hard
segment of over 50 wt % causes the soft segment to disperse in the
hard segment, affecting the shape memory properties and resulting
in permanent deformation to a degree that increases with its weight
percentage.26 To solve this problem, the
hard segment content of all samples was fixed at 32.5 wt %. Increasing
the mole proportion of the hard segment increased the degree of entanglement
of the soft segment and the strength of the secondary bonds in a manner
that depended on the molecular weight of the soft segment. The effect
of the molecular weight of the soft segment on the mechanical, thermomechanical,
and shape memory properties of these PPS-x-TPUs was
investigated in detail. This study opens up the novel prospect of
the development and extensive use of truly ecologically friendly shape
memory TPUs.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Poly(1,3-propylene succinate)
glycol (PPS) (Mn = 1000, 2000, 3000, and
4000 g/mol) was kindly provided by Tai Chin Chemical Industry Co.,
Ltd., Taiwan. MDI and BDO were kindly provided by Lidye Chemical Co.,
Ltd., Taiwan. Dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL or T12) was purchased from
Alfa Aesar. Dimethylacetamide (DMAC, 99.8%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Synthesis of PPS-x-TPUs
PPS-x-TPUs were synthesized
using a solvent-free
one-shot polymerization procedure. To remove water, PPS polyols and
the chain extender BDO were heated in a vacuum oven at 80 °C
for 4 h. MDI was melted in the oven at 60 °C for 2 h. In a typical
synthesis of PPS-1000-TPU, PPS polyols (Mn = 1000) and the chain extender BDO were thoroughly mixed using a
mechanical stirrer in polypropylene beakers, which were then placed
in the oven to maintain the temperature at 100 °C. Next, MDI
and catalyst T12 were added to the reaction mixture and mechanically
stirred at room temperature for 30 s. The reaction mixture was poured
into a Teflon-coated pan and cured in an oven at 120 °C for 3
h. The final product was dissolved in DMAC and poured into a mold
and evaporated at 80 °C for 24 h to obtain the film. PPS-2000-TPU,
PPS-3000-TPU, and PPS-4000-TPU were synthesized using the same procedure
as for PPS-1000-TPU, mentioned above. Table 1 presents the procedure in detail.

2.3 Instruments
2.3.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry
The chemical
structure of the synthesized PPS-x-TPUs was characterized
by 16 scans using a PerkinElmer Spectrum
One FT-IR spectrometer (ATR testing model) in the transmission mode
in the range 4000–650 cm–1 with a resolution
of 4 cm–1.

2.3.2 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectroscopic Analysis
1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra of the samples were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE-III
400 MHz spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA). The samples were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent, in 5 mm NMR tubes, at room temperature.

2.3.3 Gel Permeation Chromatography
Molecular
characteristics [number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (PDI)] were measured by gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Viscotek GPCmax VE-2001. DMF
was used as a mobile phase solvent at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 at 60 °C. The column was 300 × 810 mm.

2.3.4 Melting Flow Index
Melting flow
index (MI) experiments were performed using a Gotech GT-7100-MI instrument.
The temperature of the MI heater was set to 200 °C, and the samples
were loaded at 2.16 kg. The testing method was consistent with the
JIS-K7210 standard.

2.3.5 Shore Hardness Test
A Shore-A-type
hardness tester (TECLOCK GT-7100-MI) was used to test the hardness
of PPS-x-TPUs. The bulk size of the standard samples
of PPS-TPUs was 30 × 30 × 3 mm.

2.3.6 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry
The melting temperature (Tm) and glass
transition temperature (Tg) were determined
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a HITACHI SIINT SII
X-DSC7000 instrument. The samples (8–10 mg) were sealed in
an aluminum pan, maintained at −80 °C for 10 min, and
then heated to 220 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1. After 3 min, a cooling scan from 220 to −80
°C was performed at a cooling rate of −10 °C min–1. Throughout the process, the samples were in a purging
stream of nitrogen gas. Tm and Tg were measured from the second scan.

2.3.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The
thermal stability of PPS-x-TPUs (samples ranging
from 5 to 10 mg) was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
using a NETZSCH TG 209 F3 instrument. TGA began at 35 °C and
proceeded with heating to 600 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C
min–1. The variation of weight with temperature
was recorded.

2.3.8 Tensile Testing Machine
Tensile
tests of dumbbell PPS-x-TPU samples were carried
out using a Cometech A2 universal tensile testing machine following
the ASTM D412-C standard. Test specimens were strained at a crosshead
speed of 500 mm/min at room temperature until they broke. The test
comprised three specimens, whose tensile strength and elongation at
breakage were recorded.

2.3.9 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
Dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted using a HITACHI DMS 6100 instrument
in the tension mode with a dynamic stretching of 0.5%. The temperature
was increased ranging from −100 to 100 °C at a rate of
5 °C min–1, and the frequency of the instrument
was 1 Hz. The sample size was 40 mm long × 10 mm wide ×
0.25 mm thick.

2.3.10 Shape Memory Property
Testing
A shape memory property test was conducted using
a HITACHI DMS 6100
in the SS-control mode. The PPS-x-TPU film sample
was 40 mm long × 10 mm wide × 0.25 mm thick. The temperature
range for testing shape memory was based on an analysis of E′ (storage modulus), which yielded the temperatures
associated with the glassy state (fixing temperature) and rubbery
state (recovery temperature) of PPS-x-TPUs. First,
the sample was held at the deformation temperature (recovery temperature)
for 5 min; it was then strained to its maximum strain (below the yield
strain) at a strain rate of 300 mN min–1 at the
deformation temperature. When the sample strain exceeded the maximum
strain, nonreversible deformation occurred and the sample did not
recover. Second, the sample was cooled to the fixing temperature at
a cooling rate of 3 °C min–1 under a strain
and the fixing temperature was then maintained for 5 min. Third, the
force was released at a rate of −300 mN min–1 at the fixed temporary shape temperature. Finally, the sample was
heated to the recovery temperature at a heating rate of 3 °C
min–1 and this temperature was maintained for 5
min. This testing cycle was repeated three times for each sample to
determine the reproducibility of the results concerning shape memory
properties. The shape memory is evaluated using the strain fixity
(Rf) and strain recovery (Rr) ratios, which are defined as follows.27−29 1   2  where N is the number
of
cycles; εl is the maximum strain of the loaded sample
at the fixing temperature; εu is the residual strain
of the unloaded sample; and εf is the final strain
when the stress on the sample is zero at the recovery temperature.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Chemical
Structure of PPS Polyols and PPS-x-TPUs
PPS-x-TPUs (x = 1000, 2000, 3000,
and 4000) were synthesized by solvent-free one-shot
bulk polymerization using PPS (Mn = 1000,
2000, 3000, and 4000 g/mol), MDI, and BDO. Figure 1 shows the chemical structures of the PPS
polyol and PPS-x-TPUs, which were confirmed by Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses. Figures 2 and S1 also show
the FT-IR spectrum of the PPS polyols, which includes a bimodal absorption
band at 3750–3250 cm–1, which corresponds
to the stretching vibration of the −OH group. The spectrum
also includes bands at 2950 and 2850 cm–1 due to
the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the −CH2– group, respectively. The absorption bands at 1750
and 1235 cm–1 were ascribed to the C=O and
C–O stretching vibrations of the ester unit, respectively.30,31

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of biobased PPS polyols.

Figures 3 and S1 display the FT-IR spectra
of the synthesized
PPS-x-TPUs. These spectra are very similar because
of the same chemical structure; they exhibit stretching and bending
vibrational −NH absorption bands at 3330 and 1530 cm–1, which are characteristic of urethane groups, and the vibration
band at 2730 cm–1, which is characteristic of N=C=O,
disappears and becomes that of the urethane group, indicating the
successful reaction of the −OH group with the −NCO group.
The appearance of new absorption peaks at 1596 and 1460 cm–1 reveals the presence of a benzene group. The spectrum also includes
absorption bands at 1410 cm–1 due to the stretching
vibrations of the C–C aromatic benzene ring group. All of the
characteristic absorbance peaks of PPS and PPS-x-TPUs
are clearly present. Besides, the chemical structure of the PPS polyols
and PPS-x-TPUs was further scrutinized by 1H NMR analysis (Figures S2 and S3). These
results indicate that all MDI reacted with PPS polyols and the chain
extender.

3.2 Analysis of MI
The MI of PPS-x-TPUs was obtained according to the JIS-K7210 standard.
The melted PPS-x-TPUs passed through a die (diameter
= 2.095 mm) in 10 min at a set temperature of 200 °C with a sample
loading of 2.16 kg. Table 2 presents the MI of the PPS-x-TPUs. The MI
of the PPS-x-TPUs decreased strongly as the molecular
weight of the PPS polyols increased. PPS-1000-TPU had the lowest molecular
weight and PPS-4000-TPU had the highest molecular weight of all of
the polymers. The MI and molecular weight were positively correlated.
PPS-x-TPUs with a high molecular weight were formed,
and they were expected to exhibit high degrees of molecular chain
entanglement. Hence, the MI of PPS-x-TPUs decreased
as the molecular weight increased. Herein, the hard segment weight
percentage of every PPS-x-TPU was fixed at 32.5%.
However, as the molecular weight of PPS polyols increased from Mn = 1000 to 4000, the proportional amount of
the hard segments ([A] and [C]) increased (from 1.60 to 5.97 and 0.60
to 4.97 M ratio). A larger proportional amount of the hard segment
is responsible for a more exothermic one-shot bulk polymerization
reaction, explaining why the molecular weight of PPS-x-TPUs increases with the molecular weight of the PPS polyols. Accordingly,
the MI of the PPS-4000-TPU is 0.5 g 10 min–1, which
limits the polymer processing. A larger hard segment mole ratio is
associated with more secondary bonds (such as interhydrogen bonds,
benzene π–π stacking, and van der Waals’
bonds) and more entanglements, disfavoring flow of the molten PPS-4000-TPU
and resulting in a lower MI.

PPS-x-TPUs	MI (g 10 min–1 at 200 °C)	Mn (g/mol)	Mw (g/mol)	PDI

PPS-3000-TPU	4	124,563	185,757	1.491	
PPS-4000-TPU	0.5	147,247	265,507	1.803	
3.3 Gel Permeation Chromatography
The Mn, Mw, and PDI of
the PPS-x-TPUs were determined by GPC analysis (Figure S4), and the relevant data are summarized
in Table 2. The Mn and Mw of PPS-x-TPUs were in the ranges 94,930–147,247 and 132,546–265,507,
respectively. PPS-4000-TPU has a higher molecular weight than PPS-1000-TPU
because it had a higher hard segment mole ratio ([A] is 5.97 and [C]
is 4.97). The PDI values of PPS-x-TPUs were in the
range 1.396–1.803, which are highly consistent with the molecular
weights. However, all of the PPS-x-TPUs had a PDI
below 2.0, which is nevertheless high enough for polymer processing
(injection and extrusion) and various applications.

3.4 Mechanical Properties
Figure 4 and Table 3 present the mechanical properties and typical
stress–strain curves of the PPS-x-TPUs. From Table 3, the tensile strength
of the PPS-x-TPU samples gradually increases with
the molecular weight of PPS polyol, from 25.88 ± 0.03 for PPS-1000-TPU
to 64.13 ± 4.35 for PPS-4000-TPU, probably owing to many secondary
bonds and the high molecular chain entanglement. However, elongation
at breakage declines from 862.95 ± 18.65 for PPS-1000-TPUs to
783.21 ± 16.14 for PPS-4000-TPU. The decrease in elongation at
breakage with the increasing molecular weight of PPS polyol is attributable
to the many entanglements of PPS polyol soft segments.32 Additionally, as the TPU’s hard segment
mole rate increases, its E100 properties also increase. When PPS-x-TPUs are tensed, the molecular chains become ordered and
crystallization (stretching-induced crystallization) appears. PPS-2000-TPU,
PPS-3000-TPU, and PPS-4000-TPU have a higher hard segment mole ratio
than PPS-1000-TPU, and the hard segments have more strong secondary
bonds to interact with each molecular chain. Therefore, a higher hard
segment mole ratio increases the E100 (modulus at 100% deformation)
values of PPS-x-TPUs. Interestingly, the higher hard
segment mole ration of PPS-4000-TPU exhibits the microphase separation;
therefore, the hard segments will be like fillers in the PPS-4000-TPU
matrix. Therefore, the tensile strength of PPS-4000-TPU is higher
than that of other PPS-x-TPUs. The results of the
tensile testing show that the mechanical properties of the PPS-x-TPUs can be tuned over a wide range and that PPS-4000-TPUs
have the best mechanical properties of the PPS-x-TPUs
herein. Shore-A hardness values (Table 3) varied similar to the tensile strength with increasing
molecular weight of PPS polyol. Intriguingly, all of the PPS-x-TPUs had the same hard segment values (32.5%), but they
exhibited different values of hardness probably because the molecular
weight of the polyols and the hard segment mole ratio increased (A = 1.60–5.97 and C = 0.60–4.97).

3.5 Thermal Properties
3.5.1 Differential Scanning
Calorimetry
Figure 5a plots the
typical second heating DSC curves of PPS polyols. In Figure 5a, no obvious melting peaks
are witnessed because of the amorphous nature of PPS polyols. Because
the chemical structural units of PPS-polyols are odd carbons, the
chemical structure is not easy to crystallize. Therefore, no melting
peaks are observed. Figure 5b plots the typical second heating DSC curves of PPS-x-TPUs. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of PPS-1000-TPU, PPS-2000-TPU, PPS-3000-TPU, and PPS-4000-TPU
are 3, −3, −4, and −4 °C, respectively.
Clearly, the Tg of the PPS-x-TPUs decreased as the molecular weight of the soft segments (PPS
polyols) increased possibly because the free volume increased and
because of the conformation of main chains (−CH2–CH2−). The Tg values of PPS-3000-TPUs and PPS-4000-TPUs did not exhibit such a
huge drop because the higher crystallinity of the hard segment in
PPS-4000-TPU constrains the mobility of the molecular chain of the
PPS soft segment in the amorphous region and so inhibits the decrease
in Tg values.33 Therefore, the Tg of PPS-4000-TPU is
similar to that of PPS-3000-TPU. PPS-1000-TPU did not yield any Tm peak because of the lower mole ratio of the
hard segment. The structure was not sufficiently dense to be crystalline.
Nevertheless, PPS-2000-TPU and PPS-3000-TPU exhibited broad Tm peaks at 124.2 and 122.7 °C, whereas
PPS-4000-TPU exhibited a strong Tm peak
at 143.4 °C because the PPS polyol with the higher mole ratio
of hard segments created more ordered domains and a larger fraction
of ordered crystalline segments. The increase in the hard segment
mole ratio implies a higher molar amount of isocynate, chain extender
(chain extender), and long hard segment units, thus easing microphase
separation and formation of ordered hard domains. PPS-4000-TPU has
the hardest segment mole ratio than other PPS-x-TPUs.
Therefore, the ordered hard domains are easily crystallized, and as
a result, the PPS-4000-TPU shows the Tm peak.

3.5.2 Thermaogravimetric
Analysis
The
thermal decomposition of PPS-x-TPUs was studied by
making TGA measurements. Figure 6 plots the corresponding TGA and derivative thermogravimetric
analysis (DTG) curves. The TGA curves (Figure 6a) show that decomposition occurred in two
steps from 300 to 500 °C. As reported in the literature,34,35 the two-stage thermal decomposition of PPS-x-TPUs
involves the degradation of the hard segments [urethane linkages in
the first stage (Td1)] and soft segments
[PPS polyol in the second stage (Td2)]. Table S1 shows that Td1, Td2, and the 5% weight loss (Td,5%) temperatures hardly varied among the PPS-x-TPUs, revealing that the molecular weight of the PPS polyol
had only a tiny effect on the thermal decomposition of PPS-x-TPUs owing to their similar chemical structures of PPS
polyols with different molecular weights and the same hard segment
weight percentage. Notably, the Td,5% of
all PPS-x-TPUs exceeds 310 °C, indicating that
these polymers have excellent thermal stability and proving that they
can all undergo injection and extrusion processing.

3.6 Shape Memory Properties
3.6.1 Programming
Deformation/Recovery and Fixed
Temperature
The thermal transitions of PPS-x-TPUs were examined using DMA. Figure 7 shows the variations of the loss factor (tan δ)
and storage modulus (E′) with temperature
and composition for the synthesized PPS-x-TPUs. Table 4 presents the Tg values that were obtained from tan δ.
From Figure 7, the Tg of PPS-1000-TPUs that contain the PPS-1000
soft segment was −2.17 °C, whereas that of PPS-4000-TPUs
(with the PPS-4000 soft segment) was −18.25 °C. Tg decreased as the molecular weight of PPS polyols
increased. The Tg values that were obtained
from Figure 7 were
similar to those obtained from the DSC experiments. Tg declined and the tan δ peak became broader as
the molecular weight of the polyols increased. These results suggest
that the mobility of the soft segment increased (free volume increased)
with the molecular weight of polyol. The loss modulus quantifies energy
dissipation: a higher loss modulus corresponds to a greater damping
capacity.30

δ curves of PPS-x-TPUs.

Table 4 Tg Analysis
of All PPS-x-TPUs
PPS-x-TPUs	Tg (°C)	
PPS-1000-TPU	–2.17	
PPS-2000-TPU	–12.45	
PPS-3000-TPU	–19.87	
PPS-4000-TPU	–18.25	
PPS-1000-TPU has the highest
loss modulus, which relates to the
highest tan δ peak intensity compared to other PPS-x-TPUs as shown in Figure 7 and the lowest hardness as shown in Table 3. The maximum peak strength in the tan δ
curves is not only related with the volume fraction of the relaxation
phase during the Tg process but also associated
with the amorphous phase. The low hard segment mole ratio of PPS-1000-TPU
had no improvement in the crystallinity of the PPS polyol and therefore
causes the amorphous phase. Besides, damping capacity is one of the
reasons for this phenomenon because of more viscous dissipation of
the potential energy. The decrease in the tan δ peak intensity
upon the addition of PPS polyol (Mn =
2000, 3000, and 4000) is related to effect of the increase in the
hard segment mole ratio on Tg. A lower
peak intensity in the tan δ curves represents a higher storage
modulus, a lower damping capacity, and a greater hardness as a result
of entanglements of the soft segments. However, soft segment entanglements
can also affect the thermal ability of PPS-1000-TPUs from 55 to 90
°C (Figure 7),
consistent with PPS-1000-TPUs lower than PPS-2000-TPU, PPS-3000-TPU,
and PPS-4000-TPU hard segment mole ratio. The higher hard segment
mole ratio of PPS-2000-TPU, PPS-3000-TPU, and PPS-4000-TPU exhibits
a smooth plateau at 55–90 °C, reflecting excellent thermal
ability because of soft segment entanglements. PPS-1000-TPU has the
highest tan δ peak intensity and lowest E′
(Figure 7) above 50
°C, reflecting the α relaxation phenomenon of the hard
segments.36,37 The synthesized PPS-x-TPUs
can be easily deformed from their temporary shape into a rubbery state,
reducing the entropy of their molecular chains, as follows. First,
freeze the molecular chain and release the stress to cause the PPS-x-TPUs to enter the glassy state; subsequently, increase
the temperature so they enter the rubbery state to initiate recovery
of their original shape because the entropy of elastomers is greater
in the rubbery state. The shape memory test parameters are set based
on all of the abovementioned DMA results considerations.26,27,38

The glassy state and rubbery
state, which are associated with the E′ values,
determine the fixed and recovery temperatures
in the shape memory tests. Figure 7 shows that PPS-1000-TPU is in the glassy state below
−10 °C and in the rubbery state between 25 and 50 °C.
PPS-2000-TPU is in the glassy state below −25 °C and both
PPS-3000-TPU and PPS-4000-TPU are in this state below −30 °C;
they are all similar in the rubbery state between 50 and 90 °C.
The rubber plateaus of PPS-2000-TPU, PPS-3000-TPU, and PPS-4000-TPU
have wider temperature ranges than that of PPS-1000-TPU, so they can
easily adopt a temporary shape. The rubber plateau has an important
role in shape memory. Table S2 presents
the deformation/recovery and fixed temperatures.

3.6.2 Shape Memory Testing
Shape memory
testing debatably has two stages, which are (i) shape fixing and (ii)
shape recovery. In this work, the shape memory properties of synthesized
PPS-x-TPUs are determined by making DMA measurements. Figure 8 presents the three
rounds of cyclic DMA testing of the PPS-x-TPUs, and Table S3 presents the shape fixity and shape
recovery ratios of PPS-x-TPUs. All of the PPS-x-TPUs have outstanding fixity ratios (>99.60%) in the
glassy
state (PPS-1000-TPU at −25 °C and PPS-2000-TPU, PPS-3000-TPU,
and PPS-4000-TPU at −45 °C) because the molecular chains
of PPS-x-TPUs have no mobility in this state, so
their temporary shapes are effectively fixed.26 Some of the molecular chains in PPS-4000-TPU are relaxed and the
associated mobility causes shape recovery, although the temporary
shape of PPS-4000-TPU in the glass transition state is not well-fixed,
as observed in Figure 7. Therefore, the temporary shapes of PPS-x-TPUs
can be fixed well in the glassy state.

Figure 8 Stress–strain–temperature
diagram for three consecutive
shape memory rounds for (a) PPS-1000-TPU, (b) PPS-2000-TPU, (c) PPS-3000-TPU,
and (d) PPS-4000-TPU.

The maximum stress of
PPS-x-TPUs at which the
strain is reversible is determined. From Figure 8d and Table S3, the sample PPS-4000-TPU has very good thermomechanical properties
(maximum stress: 2.95 MPa and maximum strain: 144%). The soft entanglements
and secondary bonds in PPS-4000-TPU form a forced framework that maintains
the temporary shape under massive loading. As shown in Figure 7, the rubbery plateau is extended
as the number of entanglements and secondary bonds increase. Shape
memory testing of PPS-1000-TPU failed (Table S3) possibly because the deformation temperature exceeded the hard
segment α relaxation temperature. Therefore, the permanent shape
of PPS-1000-TPU was disrupted and the strain exceeded the instrument
limit in the first step of the test, so the test was stopped. Table S3 reveals that all PPS-x-TPUs had an impressive shape recovery ratio (>95.00%) in the
second
(Rr (2)) and third (Rr (3)) rounds. In the rubbery state, PPS-TPUs exhibited
physical cross-links as secondary bonds and soft segment entanglements,
so the deformation was reversed, increasing entropy. Nevertheless,
in the first round (Rr (1)), all PPS-x-TPUs permanently deformed, revealing that their recovery
ratios in this round were lower than those in the following two rounds.
PPS-x-TPU molecular chains undergo reorganization,
including orientation and the decoupling of soft entanglements, forming
a nearly ideal elastic network after the first round.15,26 Consequently, all PPS-x-TPUs exhibited similar,
outstanding recovery ratios in the following rounds (Rr (2)) and third (Rr (3)).
Herein, hard domains have an important role in shape recovery.27 The shape recovery ratios of all PPS-x-TPUs were similar because they all had the same wt % (32.5%)
of hard segments.

The shape recovery ratio of PPS-4000-TPU in
the glass transition
state was slightly lower than those of the other PPS-x-TPUs in the series. The lower mobility of the molecular chain yielded
a lower recovery ratio and therefore a longer recovery time to the
original shape. PPS-x-TPUs have great potential to
form compounds with PCL (Tm is 60 °C),
increasing the fixed temperature to the ambient temperature and easily
fixing the temporary shape at room temperature. This technique is
well-known and widely used.38−41

4 Conclusions
In this
work, a series of thermoresponsive shape memory PUs (PPS-x-TPUs) from bio-PPS polyols (Mn = 1000,
2000, 3000, and 4000) were successfully synthesized by solvent-free
one-shot bulk polymerization. All synthesized PPS-x-TPUs underwent two-step thermal decomposition, exhibiting good thermal
stability with a Td,5% above 310 °C. Tg was measured using both DSC and DMA. Both methods revealed
that Tg decreased, as the molecular weight
of PPS polyols increased. The bio-based PPS-4000-TPU exhibits the
impressive mechanical properties (hardness: 90A and tensile strength:
64.13 ± 4.35 MPa) owing to soft segment entanglements and relatively
many secondary bonds. Soft segment entanglements between 50 and 90
°C affect the thermal mechanical properties of PPS-x-TPUs (PPS-2000-TPU, PPS-3000-TPU, and PPS-4000-TPU) but they did
not reduce the modulus. Finally, the shape memory performance of the
synthesized PPS-x-TPUs was assessed. All PPS-x-TPUs exhibited a perfect shape fixity ratio (>99.60%)
and an excellent recovery ratio (>95.00%) in the glass state and
the
rubbery state, respectively, reflecting good shape memory behavior.
In conclusion, the polymers that were synthesized in this work are
suitable for coating clothes. Their recovery temperatures allow them
to be dried in a clothes dryer (45–68 °C) to help them
recover from deformation. Because when using a temperature treatment
to recover the wrinkles of PPS-coated textiles, PPS-x-TPU coating will recover the shape and also help the wrinkled textile
recover the shape. We can use the recovering force of the PPS-x-TPUs at recover temperature (50–75 °C) to
make the textile straight and smooth.
