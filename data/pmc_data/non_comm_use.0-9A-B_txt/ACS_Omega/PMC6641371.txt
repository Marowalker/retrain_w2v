Optoelectronic applications with
transparent conducting oxides
have been made possible by modulating the carrier density of wide
band gap oxides with doping. We demonstrate the modulation of the
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level in nanocrystalline CuAlO2 particles synthesized using a sol–gel technique, as
a function of doping with a magnetic impurity (Ni). This behavior
is directly correlated with structural studies using X-ray diffraction
and magnetic properties which show a similar trend. Our results can
be understood in a picture where charge hopping occurs through surface
or defect states, rather than by direct hopping between the quantum-confined
states of the nanocrystal, and an increase in the DOS at the Fermi
level caused by the substitution of Ni atoms at the Al site.

Introduction
Transparent conducting oxides exhibiting
high electrical conductivity
and transparency to visible light have found applications in window
layers of solar cells, front electrodes in flat-panel displays, defrosting
windows in refrigerators or airplanes, and photovoltaics.1−8 A key route for such applications has been the use of wide band
gap oxides for transparency and doping to modulate the carrier concentration
(n-type or p-type).9,10 The delafossite oxide CuAlO2 is a p-type transparent semiconductor that could be considered
as a candidate material for such applications.11 More recently, they have also found applications as hole
interfacial layers for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.12 However, as a result of the peculiarities of
the crystallographic structure in the bulk form, its electrical transport
can be highly anisotropic and there exists a large scatter in the
literature with regards to the conduction mechanism, ranging from
polaron transport13,14 to variable-range hopping (VRH).15 The anisotropy can be reduced by working with
nanocrystalline samples. Furthermore, doped semiconductor materials
with magnetic impurities, such as Ni, possess tunable optoelectronic
as well as magnetic properties, making them an exciting multifunctional
material to be utilized in various technical applications such as
in diagnostics, imaging, and spintronics.16

In this article, we introduce a Ni dopant into nanocrystalline
CuAlO2 and investigate the modulation of the electrical
and magnetic properties with doping. Structural studies using X-ray
diffraction (XRD) show a shift in the CuAlO2 peaks toward
lower angles with an increase in the dopant concentration. Two-terminal
transport measurements suggest that the conduction mechanism is given
by VRH for all doping concentrations within the temperature range
of investigation (90–300 K). Variations in the density of states
(DOS) at the Fermi level, extracted from transport measurements, show
a peak at 1% Ni concentration. Magnetic data show the improvement
in the ferromagnetic (FM) properties at low doping concentrations
(1%) and are supported by first-principles density functional theory
(DFT) simulations. All the above observations are consistent with
the preferential substitution of the dopant impurity, Ni, at the Al
cation site for low doping concentrations.

Results and Discussion
CuAlO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using a sol–gel
method which requires cheap precursors while offering fine control
of the stoichiometric homogeneity. Al(NO3)3·3H2O (2.62 g, 7 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (1.695 g, 7 mmol) were stirred in 30 mL of methanol for
45 min at room temperature. Citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7H2O) (5.88 g, 28 mmol) was dissolved
in 30 mL of water and then added to the mixture of nitrates. Then,
the whole mixture was again stirred for 1 h at room temperature to
obtain a well-mixed precursor solution. The solution was further stirred
at 70 °C for 24 h. After the formation of gel, it was heated
at 1100 °C for 6 h in a muffle furnace. The use of citric acid
plays an important role in the synthesis of CuAlO2 nanoparticles.
It acts as a fuel for the combustion reaction and prevents the precipitation
of hydroxylated compounds by reacting with metal precursors to form
complexes. It also acts as a growth inhibitor and is responsible for
the smaller size of CuAlO2 nanoparticles. Some impurities
such as CuO and CuAl2O4 are also formed along
with the nanoparticles. To remove the impurities, purification was
carried out using 35% HCl, followed by centrifugation for 3 min at
4300 rpm and an isopropanol wash. This process was repeated twice,
and the obtained powder was dried at 60 °C in an oven for 20
h.

Figure 1 shows
the
diffraction pattern of the prepared solids. The structure has been
indexed to the rhombohedral crystal structure with a space group R3m̅. Mostly, this matches with the
JCPDS pattern #09-0185. Two peaks that cannot be accounted for and
are marked by stars in the figure are due to the presence of a small
amount of CuAl2O4 (JCPDS #78-0556) that could
not be washed away completely. In the rhombohedral structure, the
Cu atom is linearly coordinated between the two oxygen atoms, forming
a dumbbell-like structure. The Al–O coordination results in
an Al-centered edge-shared octahedral structure which separates the
CuO2 dumbbell structure. In the delafossite structure,
there are two cation sites, Cu+ at position 3(a) (0,0,0)
and Al3+ at position 3(b) (0,0,1/2), and one anion site,
O at position 6(c) (0,0,u).17 The peaks show strong intensities, suggesting a high degree of crystallinity.

the shift in the peak positions with doping. (c) XRD patterns showing
the effect of washing on 1% Ni-doped CuAlO2. The dopant
percentages mentioned are nominal. (d) Transmission electron micrographs
of CuAlO2.

Upon doping with Ni2+ ions, a shift of diffraction
peaks
toward lower diffraction angle was observed, as shown in Figure 1b. Upon introduction
of Ni, we observe the presence of CuO phase, as shown in Figure 1c. It could therefore
be concluded that Ni2+ ion is replacing the Cu+ ion which is being pushed out of the lattice in the form of CuO.
The ionic radius of Cu+ (0.46 Å) is smaller than the
ionic radius of Ni2+ (0.69 Å). The larger Ni2+ ion would then be expected to push the Cu+ in an O–Cu–O
dumbbell shape, resulting in the expansion of the lattice parameter
and shift of diffraction peaks toward lower angles, as we have observed
here. The same effect would be observed if Ni2+ replaces
an Al3+ cation that has a 0.53 Å diameter. This substitution
should also be reflected in the electronic properties of the doped
materials as we show below.

The dopant percentages mentioned
were measured presynthesis. We
have further used energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to ensure the presence
of Ni dopant. We find that the dopant percentages postsynthesis are
in good agreement with the amount of Ni dopant used in the synthesis.
We find the atomic concentrations of 1.8, 2.8, and 4.3% corresponding
to the nominal concentrations of 1, 3, and 5%, respectively. No traces
of Ni are observed in the undoped samples. The average size of CuAlO2 nanoparticles was found to be 25–28 nm from XRD measurements
and further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as
shown in Figure 1d.

Transport measurements were performed on pellets made from respective
powders, inside a CTI-Cryogenics closed cycle cryostat using a Keithley
2611 sourcemeter and a Keithley 6485 picoammeter. Electrical contacts
to the pellets were made in a sandwich geometry using a silver paint.
The samples were stored in vacuum and exposed to air to make electrical
contacts. Figure 2 shows
the current (I)–voltage (V) characteristics for the undoped and 1 and 3% Ni-doped samples.
The I–V characteristics are
linear at low bias voltages for all temperatures measured, indicative
of ohmic contact at the interface. For comparable thickness of the
pellets, the current drops by orders of magnitude as the doping concentration
is increased from 0 to 3%. Figure 2a–c shows the current at low bias as a function
of inverse temperature for undoped (filled circles), 1% (filled squares),
and 3% Ni (filled triangles) doped samples. As the samples show Ohmic
behavior near zero bias, the current can be directly related to the
conductivity. For all three samples, we find that the device conductivity
reduces rapidly with an initial decrease of temperature but becomes
weaker as we move to lower temperatures.

at various temperatures (a) 0% Ni, (b) 1% Ni, and (c) 3% Ni.

We investigate the temperature
dependence of the current by analyzing
the temperature dependence of the reduced activation energy, w = T–1∂ρ/∂T–1, following the approach developed
by Zabrodskii and Zinov’eva.18 If
the resistivity follows a power law behavior, ρ(T) ∝ exp(T0/T)x, the power law exponent can be calculated
by exploring in place of ρ(T), the quantity w(T) 1  

To determine
the power law exponent, we plot the logarithm of w as a function of the logarithm of the temperature T, as shown in Figure 3b. We find exponents of 0.24 ± 0.3 and 0.22 ±
0.2 for a voltage of 0.1 and 0.5 V across the undoped sample, respectively.
These are consistent with Mott’s VRH in three dimensions, where
the resistivity scales as 1/T1/4. Although
the data shown in Figure 3b are for the undoped samples, similar exponents are observed
for the doped samples as well.

function of inverse temperature
(1/T) for 0, 1, and 3% Ni-doped nanocrystalline CuAlO2 solids. Lines serve as guides to the eye. (b) Logarithm of
the reduced activation energy, w = T–1∂ρ/∂T–1, as a function of the logarithm of T. Straight lines represent fits to eq 1. (c) Conductivity as a function of 1/T1/4 fitted by the Mott’s VRH model, I = I0 exp(−(T*/T)1/4. (d) Variation of T* (solid line and markers) as a function of nominal dopant concentration.
The right axis shows the DOS at the Fermi level (dashed lines and
empty markers), extracted from the data in (c), assuming a barrier
height comparable to the electron affinity of the nanoparticle.

A log–linear plot of the
current as a function of 1/T1/4 for all
three samples is shown in Figure 3c. As the 1/T1/4 dependence
can fit our data for the temperature
range studied here, the conduction mechanism is consistent with Mott’s
VRH19 2  where 3  Here, a is the localization
length, g0 is the DOS at the Fermi level,
and kB is the Boltzmann constant. We note
that the conduction mechanism does not change with doping.

The
localization length for colloidal nanocrystals of diameter
smaller than the Bohr radius has typically been found to be comparable
to be of the order of the dot radius.20 However, there exists some scatter in the literature for the value
of localization length, and length scales much smaller than the dot
radius have been reported for ZnO nanocrystals.21 Localization lengths of the order of ∼1 nm are typically
reported for amorphous Ge-based semiconductors.22 For our larger nanocrystals, we estimate the localization
length directly from the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin expression
of the tunneling probability, a = 2ℏ/m*Eb, where m* is the effective mass of the charge carrier and Eb is the barrier height. We look at two extreme cases
of the barrier height. If we assume that tunneling only occurs between
the nanocrystals through an insulating medium, it is reasonable to
take a barrier height comparable to the electron affinity of the nanoparticle
(in this case ∼3 eV23). For tunneling
through an insulating barrier of height of ∼3 eV, we obtain
a localization length of 0.17 nm. We may then obtain the DOS at the
Fermi level for each of the samples, assuming that the dopant concentration
does not significantly alter the localization length. The chemical
tendency of Cu to favor higher valence states enables heavy p-type
doping in the material, resulting in holes as majority charge carriers.11,24 Further, hybridization between the Cu d and O p states improves
the dispersion of the valence bands, resulting in an effective mass
of 2.6m0, where m0 is the mass of an electron.11,24

Figure 3d shows
the variation of T*, as a function of the nominal
Ni dopant concentration. Working with a localization length of 0.17
nm, we estimate the DOS at the Fermi level as a function of dopant
concentration, as shown on the right axis of Figure 3d. Although samples prepared in different
batches show different DOS levels for the undoped samples, the general
trend in the variation of the DOS with doping remains unchanged. A
peak in the DOS is observed for 1% Ni doping. As CuAlO2 is expected to have holes as majority carriers, a substitution of
Ni2+ at Al3+ sites would result in an increase
in the density of free holes. The substitution of Ni ions at the Al
site is consistent with diffraction shifts discussed earlier. The
decrease in the DOS with further increase in the Ni concentration
may be caused by the substitution of a larger percentage of Ni atoms
at point defects or vacancies, and possibly at the Cu site as well.
However, the increase in the DOS and the concentration of free holes
would possibly compete with scattering from defects and impurities
to determine the total resistance of the sample. This could explain
the decrease in the current for sample of thicknesses as the concentration
of Ni is increased from 0 to 1%.

The hopping distance, given
by R = 0.75(3a/2πg0kBT)1/4,19 is estimated to be 2.3 nm
at room temperature and 3.1 nm
at 100 K. This is much smaller than the nanoparticle diameter, suggesting
that hopping is primarily between the surface and other defect states,
rather than directly from one nanoparticle to the other. Similar results
have also been reported for ZnO nanocrystals where the defect density
was varied using UV illumination.21 If
the hopping process mainly occurs between the defect states within
nanocrystals, we choose a barrier height corresponding to typical
defect or pinning states in CuAlO2 (0.3 eV).10 The hopping distance is expected to fluctuate
if the localization length changes, possibly because of barrier height
or Fermi level fluctuations. An upper limit to the hopping distance
can be set by assuming a barrier height fluctuation of almost an order
of magnitude, that is, 3 to 0.3 eV. We obtain new hopping distances
of 9.7 and 7.4 nm at 100 and 300 K, respectively, which are still
smaller than the nanoparticle diameter. Therefore, our previous suggestion
that charge transport occurs through hopping between donor or surface
states holds true for longer localization lengths as well. We can
further estimate the critical temperature to observe Efros–Shklovskii
VRH (ES-VRH),25Tc = e4ag0/kB(4πϵϵ0)2. Using a dielectric constant of 7.7 for CuAlO2,26 we obtain a critical temperature of
∼4 K for the undoped sample. This low value for the critical
temperature is consistent with the absence of the ES-VRH regime, characterized
by the T1/2 regime in these samples.

To probe the magnetic properties for Ni doping at the Al site and
correlate the increase in the DOS with doping, we performed first-principles
calculations based on spin-dependent DFT calculations using a standard
plane-wave code Quantum ESPRESSO27 within
the generalized gradient approximation28 for the interaction energy of the electrons. We use ultrasoft pseudopotentials29 to represent the interaction between ions and
electrons. An energy cutoff of 50 Ry on the plane-wave basis was used
in representation of Kohn–Sham wave functions. Most calculations
involved 2 × 2 × 2 supercells with 32 atoms corresponding
to a doping concentration of 12.5%. The Ni dopants were introduced
only at Al sites as the replacement of Cu sites with Ni has been the
subject of multiple theoretical studies.30−32 Slab calculations
were performed with 2 × 2 supercells in the plane of the surface,
after introducing a vacuum of 15 Å and allowing for surface reconstruction.
Brillouin zone integrations were sampled with a 6 × 6 ×
6 Monkhorst–Pack mesh.33 Structural
optimization was carried out with Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
algorithm to minimize energy using Hellmann–Feynman forces.

We study the DOS when Ni is substituted at the Al site for bulk
and slab geometries of CuAlO2. The slab mimics the surface
effects expected from a nanocrystalline sample. Figure 4a shows the orbital-projected DOS for undoped
CuAlO2 (top panel) and with 12.5% Ni doping. The shaded
areas represent the Cu d states and Ni d states in the top and bottom
panel, respectively. The Fermi energy has been set to 0 eV for both
cases. As the replacement of an Al atom by a Ni atom introduces a
hole in the valence band, we can find that the Fermi level falls on
the spin-up states with primary contributions from Ni d states. We
find that the FM state is lower in energy as compared to the nonmagnetic
(NM) state by 0.16 eV. For a slab geometry, we find that the lowest
energy configuration is achieved when an Al atom on the surface is
replaced by Ni, as opposed to an Al site in the interior. In this
configuration, the FM state is lower in energy than the NM state by
1.22 eV. The FM configuration where an Al atom in the interior is
replaced with a Ni atom is lower in energy by 0.08 eV.

Figure 4 (a) Total (solid line)
and orbital-projected DOS (filled) for bulk
undoped CuAlO2 and Ni-doped CuAlO2, with Ni
replacing the Al site. Cu d orbitals (top panel) and Ni d orbitals
(bottom panel) have been shaded. (b) Magnetic moment as a function
of applied magnetic field at 10 K for undoped (black), 1% Ni-doped
(red), 3% Ni-doped (green), and 5% Ni-doped CuAlO2 (blue).

Figure 4b shows
the experimentally observed magnetic moments as a function of applied
magnetic field, H at a temperature of 10 K. The inset
shows hysteresis loops observed at low fields. We find that the undoped
CuAlO2 also shows a finite hysteresis loop. This is consistent
with the previous reports on CuAlO2, where this behavior
is attributed to the existence of point defects which give rise to
magnetic properties even in the absence of magnetic dopants.34 The samples doped with 1% Ni show the maximum
moment and largest hysteresis loop area. However, the FM behavior
decreases with further increase in Ni concentration. This is presumably
due to oxygen-mediated anti-FM superexchange interactions between
the adjacent Ni ions, which suppress the FM coupling.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the modulation of structural,
electrical, and magnetic properties of Ni-doped CuAlO2 nanoparticles.
The transport mechanism is given by Mott’s VRH between the
localized surface and defect states and is robust to doping with Ni.
Structural investigations reveal a shift of diffraction peaks to lower
angles with doping, suggesting the substitution of Ni atoms at Al
sites rather than Cu sites. A modulation in the DOS at the Fermi level
is obtained from transport measurements, with a peak in the DOS at
1% doping concentration, consistent with the replacement of Al3+ cation with the Ni2+ ion for low doping concentrations.
At higher concentrations, the Ni ions possibly replace the Cu+ cations and defect sites, resulting in a decrease in the
DOS at the Fermi level with further increase in the doping concentration.
First-principles DFT calculations support the increase in the DOS
with Ni doping, due to the contribution from Ni d states, and stabilization
of FM order in the system. Magnetic measurements also support improvement
in FM properties at low doping concentrations (1%) and decrease of
FM behavior with further increase in doping.
