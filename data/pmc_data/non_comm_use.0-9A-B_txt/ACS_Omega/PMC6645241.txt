SnTe has been the
focus of numerous experimental and theoretical
studies over the last years owing to its high thermoelectric performances
near 800 K when appropriately doped. Here, we demonstrate that melt-spinning,
an ultrafast-quenching synthesis technique, followed by spark plasma
sintering results in enhanced ZT values in polycrystalline
SnTe. To illustrate the impact of this technique, the results are
contrasted with those obtained on two polycrystalline samples prepared
by direct quenching of molten SnTe and without quenching. SnTe melt-spun
ribbons are characterized by a peculiar columnar microstructure that
contributes to lower the lattice thermal conductivity below 700 K
in pressed samples. More importantly, this technique results in a
significant decrease in the hole concentration, giving rise to enhanced
thermopower values above 500 K. The variation in the hole concentration
is likely due to a slight loss of elemental Te during the melt-spinning
process. Thanks to the decreased hole concentration, the thermoelectric
performances are significantly enhanced with a peak ZT value of 0.6 at 800 K, which represents a 40% increase over the
values measured for samples prepared with and without quenching. These
findings indicate that melt-spinning provides a novel strategy to
improve the thermoelectric properties of SnTe that could be worthwhile
extending to substituted compounds.

Introduction
Thermoelectric modules
provide the remarkable possibility to directly
convert heat into electricity (thermoelectric generators) or vice
versa (Peltier coolers).1−3 Despite its success in space applications,
this technology still remains in its infancy owing to the low efficiency
achieved in current thermoelectric modules.1−3 The dimensionless
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT = α2T/ρ(κL + κe) is the key material parameter that governs the efficiency of energy
conversion.1 A good thermoelectric material
must meet a subtle balance between a large thermopower (α),
a low electrical resistivity (ρ), and low lattice (κL) and electronic (κe) thermal conductivities.
Except for κL which is tied to phonon transport,
all the transport coefficients are interdependent on each other through
the carrier concentration. The best compromise between thermal and
electrical transport is usually achieved in heavily doped semiconductors
crystallizing into complex crystal structures.1−3

Over the
last few years, the thermoelectric properties of the simple
binary SnTe have been revisited, demonstrating that good thermoelectric
performances could be achieved at high temperatures.4−22 This lead-free analogue of the conventional thermoelectric material
PbTe crystallizes in the rock salt structure composed of a face-centered
cubic lattice of Te atoms with Sn filling all of the octahedral voids.23 In addition to being a topological crystalline
insulator,24 the electronic band structure
of SnTe mirrors that of PbTe with the presence of a direct band gap
at the L point in the Brillouin zone (∼0.18
eV) and two nondegenerate valence bands at the L and
Σ points.25−28 These two bands give rise to simultaneous contributions of heavy
and light holes to the transport. The only difference between SnTe
and PbTe is related to the energy separation between these two bands
which is significantly higher in SnTe (∼0.3–0.4 eV)
compared to that in PbTe (∼0.1 eV).26−28 Furthermore,
SnTe is systematically off-stoichiometric because of a large concentration
of Sn vacancies which act as double acceptors resulting in a p-type
carrier concentration on the order of 1021 cm–3 at 300 K.29,30 Hence, the chemical formula of
this compound should be rigorously written as Sn1–zTe with 0.004 ≤ z ≤
0.043 at 873 K (hereafter, we nevertheless keep the formula SnTe to
follow the convention used in the literature).28,29,31 Such large hole concentration leads to metallic
properties that can be tuned by either substitution in the Sn or Te
sites or introduction of an Sn excess, both of which compensate the
Sn vacancies.4−22 The chemical flexibility of SnTe, which can accommodate a large
number of substituting elements,4−22 offers a plethora of possibilities to optimize its thermoelectric
properties, leading to ZT values ranging between
1.0 and 1.5 near 800–900 K.4−22 SnTe exhibits lattice thermal conductivity values on the order of
∼2.5 W m–1 K–1 at 300 K,4−22 which can be further lowered by the formation of nanoprecipitates
in addition to mass fluctuations introduced by substitutions.15,20,22

The melt-spinning technique,
which consists of ultrafast quenching
of molten compounds on a water-cooled rotating wheel, has been employed
to produce ribbons, flakes, or foils with unique nanoscale structures
that can potentially help to reduce significantly the thermal transport.
In particular, this technique has been successfully used to modulate
the thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te3-based
alloys near room temperature or of skutterudites at high temperatures
in the past decades.32−39 Here, we demonstrate that this technique can be equally applied
to produce SnTe ribbons with enhanced thermoelectric properties compared
to samples synthesized by conventional techniques. Our results show
that the hole concentration in SnTe sensitively depends on the synthetic
conditions used. The ultrafast cooling rate achieved in melt-spinning
(estimated to be as high as 104 to 107 K s–1) results in lower hole concentrations with respect
to conventional synthesis techniques and hence in higher ZT values that reach 0.6 at 800 K. These results demonstrate that melt-spinning
is a rapid and efficient technique to produce polycrystalline SnTe
with optimized thermoelectric properties.

Results and Discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns, shown in Figure 1, were collected
on ground melt-spun ribbons and unquenched and quenched samples. The
three patterns can be fully indexed within the space group Fm3̅m of SnTe, indicating the absence
of secondary phases within the detection limits of PXRD. These analyses
further show that SnTe ribbons were successfully produced by melt-spinning.
The comparison of the three patterns reveals clear differences in
the relative intensities of the Bragg reflections between the melt-spun
sample and the two other samples with, in particular, a strong renormalization
of the intensity of the (200) and (222) reflections, indicating that
the melt-spun ribbons are textured.

Figure 1 XRD patterns obtained on ground unquenched
and quenched ingots
and ground melt-spun ribbons. The main reflections are indexed.

The lattice parameters, inferred
from Rietveld refinements, are a = 6.3219(3), 6.3119(4),
and 6.3240(4) Å for the unquenched,
quenched, and melt-spun samples, respectively, which are in good agreement
with the literature data.4−22 A prior study on self-compensated Sn1+xTe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) has demonstrated
a clear correlation between the lattice parameter and the hole concentration,
making the former a sensitive measure of the composition in these
compounds.5 The results showed that the
lattice expands as Sn vacancies are compensated by Sn excess up to x = 0.03, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the hole
concentration.5 Thus, the higher lattice
parameter in the melt-spun sample suggests that the hole concentration
is lower in comparison to that in the two other samples. As we will
see below, this assumption is confirmed by Hall effect measurements.

To gain relevant insights into the microstructure of the melt-spun
ribbons, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed
on a randomly selected ribbon on the surface that was in contact with
the wheel, on the free surface, and on the cross section (Figure 2). The surface in
contact (Figure 1a–c)
consists of micron-sized grains in addition to nano-sized particles,
whereas a different microstructure is observed on the free surface
(Figure 1d–f).
These analyses further reveal the presence of a Sn-rich phase in some
grains of both surfaces (visible as bright spots in Figure 1a,b,c,e,f), which is systematically
observed at the center of the grain (Figure 1a–c). The segregation of elemental
Sn is in agreement with the inherent off-stoichiometry of SnTe owing
to Sn vacancies. While Sn and Te are homogeneously distributed in
all of the pressed samples as indicated by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS) analyses (Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting Information), some weak but discernible
inhomogeneities are present on the ribbon’s surface that was
in contact with the wheel (Figure 3) because of the high quenching rate achieved. This
inhomogeneous distribution is not visible on the free surface of the
ribbons (Figure 3).

surface (a–c), of the free surface (d–f), and of a cross
section (g–i) of SnTe ribbons, revealing the columnar microstructure
induced by melt-spinning.

maps of the contact surface (upper row) and of the free surface (lower

The temperature dependences of the measured electrical resistivity
and thermopower on the three samples are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively. Regardless
of the synthesis technique used, ρ shows a metallic temperature
dependence in the whole temperature range in agreement with the intrinsic
metallic nature of SnTe.4−22 The technique used has virtually no influence on the ρ values
which remain nearly constant to ∼1.8 μΩ m at 300
K. At higher temperatures, however, the ρ values of the melt-spun
sample increase substantially more with temperature than those of
the two other samples. The temperature dependences of α (Figure 3b) are consistent
with the ρ data with the highest values observed in the melt-spun
sample above 500 K. Below this temperature, the α values are
lower in the melt-spun sample than those in the two other samples
which exhibit similar values. Above 650 K, this trend reverses, and
the melt-spun sample shows the highest values at 800 K. Both this
trend reversal and the faster rise in α observed in the melt-spun
sample have been attributed to the subtle balance between the contributions
of the heavy- and light-hole bands with the former manifesting itself
at high temperatures.4−22 The temperature dependences of ρ and α are typical to
those widely observed in pristine and doped SnTe compounds where both
properties increase with increasing either the concentration of the
substituting element or the Sn excess in self-compensated samples
Sn1+xTe.4−22 The trend observed in the electrical properties is thus consistent
with the assumption that melt-spinning leads to a decrease in the
hole concentration with respect to conventional techniques.

In all panels, the solid lines are guides to the eye.

Hall measurements’ data measured at 300
K confirm this scenario
with RH values which are significantly
lower in the unquenched and melt-spun samples than that in the quenched
sample. Within a single-carrier picture, these values yield estimates
of the hole concentration p of 1.2 × 1020, 2.9 × 1020, and 1.1 × 1021 cm–3 in the melt-spun, unquenched, and quenched
samples, respectively. The hole concentration in the melt-spun sample
is equivalent to that obtained in self-compensated compounds where
hole concentrations on the order of 1020 cm–3 have been achieved.5 The influence of
melt-spinning on the hole concentration is possibly due to slight
sublimation of Te that occurs before the molten compound is ejected
through the nozzle. This loss of Te partially compensates Sn vacancies,
thereby decreasing the hole concentration in the ribbons and eventually
in the pressed melt-spun sample. Another possibility is related to
modifications of the Sn–Te phase diagram because of the strong
out-of-equilibrium conditions imposed by this ultrafast quenching
as evidenced in the Bi2Te3–Sb2Te3 solid solution.40,41 The Hall mobility,
μH, increases as p decreases with
values of 50, 150, and 580 cm2 V–1 s–1 for the quenched, unquenched, and melt-spun samples,
respectively, which are in good agreement with prior studies.4−22

The total thermal conductivity κ, shown in Figure 4c as a function of
the temperature,
is significantly lowered by melt-spinning in the whole temperature
range, whereas the difference between the quenched and unquenched
samples is less pronounced. To gain further insights into the influence
of the melt-spinning process on κL requires an accurate
determination of the electronic component κe (see Figure 4c). In the case of
SnTe, the estimation of κe via the Wiedemann–Franz
relation κe = LT/ρ, where L is the Lorenz number, is particularly difficult because L critically depends on the hole scattering mechanisms and
details of the electronic band structure. In self-compensated and
substituted SnTe, the electronic properties have been modeled by considering
both parabolic and nonparabolic bands to describe the heavy- and light-hole
bands, respectively, with acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant
scattering mechanism.4−22 Both the temperature dependence and L values were
found to be highly sensitive to the hole concentration of the sample.
However, we found that this two-band model yields overestimated L values, resulting in unphysical κL values
above 600 K, that is, in the temperature region where the two-band
behavior is more pronounced. To overcome this issue, we considered
a single-parabolic band model that was used in a prior study to estimate
κe in the series Sn1+xTe.5 This model, however, breaks down
for samples with a hole concentration on the order of 1021 cm–3 and also leads to unphysical κL values. The reason behind this failure is probably related
to the multiband electronic structure that governs the transport at
high hole concentrations and to a significant change in the density
of states effective mass of the nonparabolic band, which is not taken
into account in both models. For these reasons, none of these models
could be applied to the quenched sample. As shown in Figure 4c, the κL values
of the melt-spun sample are lower than those derived for the unquenched
sample with a minimum value of 0.5 W m–1 K–1 already reached at 500 K. The increase observed above this temperature
for the melt-spun sample is likely an artifact of the single-band
model used which does not account for the significant contribution
of the heavy-hole band between 600 and 800 K. Keeping in mind the
above-mentioned inherent difficulties in estimating κe, these results nevertheless seem to indicate that the particular
microstructure induced by melt-spinning contributes to limit the phonon
transport in SnTe below 700 K in a way similar to that observed in
samples containing nanodomains.14,15,20,22 At higher temperatures, however,
the influence of this technique is less pronounced because the lattice
thermal conductivity values measured in the melt-spun sample seem
to be higher than those achieved in the unquenched sample.

The
combination of the three transport properties results in ZT values that increase with increasing temperature (Figure 4d). Because of a
decreased hole concentration and steep rise in the thermopower values,
the ZT values of the melt-spun sample rapidly increase
above 500 K to reach a maximum value of 0.6 at 800 K. The peak ZT value obtained in the melt-spun sample is 40% higher
than the maximum values obtained in the unquenched and quenched samples
for which a peak ZT value of 0.45 at 800 K is achieved
in the former. The results obtained on the melt-spun sample are consistent
with prior studies on self-compensated Sn1+xTe compounds where a maximum ZT value of 0.6
has been reported for x = 0.04.5 However, the lower thermal conductivity values achieved
above 500 K in the melt-spun sample contribute to reach higher ZT values between 600 and 800 K than that in the Sn1+xTe samples as a result of a shift of the ZT(T) curve toward lower temperatures.
Our results thus demonstrate that melt-spinning is an interesting
approach to tune the carrier concentration in polycrystalline SnTe
to a level equivalent to that obtained in optimized samples. Although
the peak ZT value achieved in the melt-spun sample
is not enhanced compared to that in optimized samples prepared by
conventional synthetic routes,5 this technique
may open a new avenue for optimizing the thermoelectric properties
of SnTe-based compounds, which warrants further investigations.

Experimental
Methods
In this study, three polycrystalline samples of SnTe
were synthesized
by the direct reaction of stoichiometric amounts of Sn shots (99.999%)
and Te powders (99.999%) in an equimolar ratio in evacuated and sealed
quartz tubes. The ampules were sealed under inert atmosphere, heated
to 1133 K over 10 h in a rocking furnace, and maintained at this temperature
for 5 h. The first sample was quenched in room-temperature water,
whereas the two other samples were furnace-cooled to room temperature.
As a second step, one furnace-cooled ingot was used for melt-spinning.
The melt-spinning process was performed with a melt-spinner (Bühler)
equipped with a copper wheel of ∼20 cm in diameter. The ∼10
g ingot was placed in a quartz tube with a V-shaped end and a nozzle
diameter of 1 mm. No additional elemental Te has been added to compensate
a possible loss of Te during the heating process. The sample was heated
to ∼1133 K under argon atmosphere (0.8 bar) with the temperature
continuously monitored by a digital infrared pyrometer (Maurer). The
molten sample was ejected from the tube on the copper wheel rotating
at 12 m s–1 (linear speed) using an overpressure
of 1.3 bar of argon. Upon contact with the wheel, the melt was instantaneously
cooled, yielding ribbons with dimensions on the order of 7–10
mm in length, 2–3 mm in width, and ∼20 μm in thickness.
All of the three samples (quenched, unquenched, and melt-spun) were
ground into fine powders and loaded in a 10 mm diameter graphite die.
The powders were then consolidated by spark plasma sintering at 773
K for 10 min under a uniaxial pressure of 64 MPa. For all samples,
the relative density was above 97% of the theoretical density from
XRD data. The nature and phase purity of the samples were verified
by PXRD using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE instrument with Cu Kα1 radiation.
The chemical homogeneity of the consolidated samples and the microstructure
of the ribbons were analyzed by SEM and EDXS using a Quanta FEG 650
(FEI).

For transport property measurements, samples with well-defined
shape and dimensions (typically 2 × 2 × 8 mm3 and 10 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness for bar- and disk-shaped samples,
respectively) were cut with a diamond-wire saw from the dense ingots.
Thermopower and electrical resistivity were simultaneously measured
on bar-shaped samples between 300 and 800 K using a ZEM-3 setup (ULVAC-RIKO).
Thermal conductivity was determined in the same temperature range
following the relation κ = aCpd where a is the thermal
diffusivity, Cp is the
specific heat, and d is the experimental density.
Thermal diffusivity was measured on disk-shaped samples by the laser
flash technique using a Netzsch LFA 427 instrument. The specific heat
was measured by differential scanning calorimetry using a Pegasus
403 instrument (Netzsch), while the density was considered temperature-independent.
The Hall coefficient RH was measured at
300 K using the ac transport option of a physical property measurement
system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The Hall carrier concentration p and the Hall mobility μH of the charge
carriers were calculated from the Hall coefficient RH, assuming a single-carrier picture and a Hall factor rH of 1 according to the relations p = rH/RHe = 1/RHe and
μH = RH/ρ, where e is the elementary charge.
