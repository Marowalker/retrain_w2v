We
have evaluated the ability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies to describe the difference
in the folding propensities of two structurally highly similar cyclic
β-hairpins, comparing the outcome to that of molecular dynamics
simulations. NAMFIS-type NMR ensemble analysis and CD spectroscopy
were observed to accurately describe the consequence of altering a
single interaction site, whereas a single-site 13C NMR
chemical shift melting curve-based technique was not.

1 Introduction
Peptides,1−3 β-hairpins in particular,4−8 are common model systems for the investigation of
weak interactions that direct protein folding. Peptide conformational
equilibria in solution is typically evaluated using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy,
differential scanning calorimetry, or by computational analysis.5,7 Many experimental studies apply one of the above techniques,6,9−15 whereas the ability of the methods to describe peptide folding has
scarcely been compared; nor has their ability to detect a slight difference
in folding upon a minor structural change of a peptide been assessed.
Such a comparative evaluation is expected to help the method of selection
for future studies and to provide a basis for comparison of data for
systems whose folding was described using different techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
To evaluate the ability of the
NMR-based ensemble analysis technique
NAMFIS,16 of chemical shift melting curve
analysis and of CD spectroscopy for detecting the influence of a small
structural modification on β-hairpin folding, we have synthesized17 cyclic decapeptides 1 and 2 (Figure 1). These peptides differ only in the availability or absence of a
hydrogen bond donor site, permitting or preventing the formation of
an interstrand hydrogen bond, stabilizing the β-hairpin.18 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used
as an independent, nonspectroscopic method in the benchmarking of
the spectroscopic techniques, suggesting 64% folded β-hairpin
population for 1 and 43% for 2 in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) at 298 K. Here, following a previously established
protocol,19 conformations possessing ≥3
interstrand hydrogen bonds HB1–4 (Figure 1) in the MD trajectory frames were defined
as folded (Table S20). The phi (φ)
and psi (ψ) dihedral angles of the DP5–G6
turn of folded 1 and 2 indicated it to form
a type II′ β-turn (Figure S16), whereas those of the N10–G1 turn segment to adopt a type
II β-turn (Figure S17).20,21 In agreement with the expected formation of an interstrand S(Me)3–S8
hydrogen bond in 1, the bond lengths of HB2 and HB3 were
observed to be shorter in 1 compared with those of 2, whereas their turn regions showed comparable HB1 and HB4
distances (Figure S15).

Figure 1 Structures of β-hairpin
peptides 1 and 2, with the interaction center
encircled and highlighted in
gray. The possible interstrand hydrogen bonds are denoted as HB1–HB4.

Population change maps (Tables S21 and S22), generated by following the
transitions between various hydrogen-bonded
states in the MD trajectory frames, revealed that both peptides fold
by first forming the HB4 hydrogen bond, followed by HB1, and finally
HB3 and HB2, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Folding pathways and populations for peptides 1 (red)
and 2 (blue). The most probable folding route from the
fully unfolded oooo to the completely folded cccc conformation was derived from the population change
maps that are shown in Tables S21 and S22. The probability of each state at room temperature is denoted below
the hydrogen bond schemes, with red and blue indicating 1 and 2, respectively. Probabilities of the less populated
states are given in the Supporting Information.

CD spectroscopy is a widely used
tool for the characterization
of the overall secondary structure of proteins and peptides and is
commonly performed by deconvolution of the spectra into various secondary
structure components.12,22 The spectra of the two peptides
(Figure 3) are remarkably
different. In accordance with the literature, 1 shows
a double minimum at 205 and 223 nm, which is indicative of β-hairpin
possessing a strong type II′ β-turn.23 By contrast, 2, expected to exhibit a lower
β-hairpin content than 1, shows a broad minimum
at 220 nm, characteristic for β-hairpins.23 Accordingly, 1 shows a stronger negative molar
ellipticity in the 216–220 nm interval than 2,
which may reflect a higher stability of its folded structure. However,
these CD features are not directly interpretable as quantitative indicators
for relative folding propensity. For the estimation of the folded
population of 1 and 2, we have obtained
the CD spectra within an 80 K temperature interval at λ = 200–260
nm (Figure 3) and have
deconvoluted the spectra into predominantly β-hairpin and random
coil components via principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure S24).12 With
increasing temperature, the broad negative CD band at 216–220
nm, corresponding to the β-hairpin structure24 of both 1 and 2, loses intensity,
whereas the band at 200 nm, consistent with a random coil component,
gains intensity (Figure 3).
The strong negative CD bands at 205 and 223 nm, observed for 1, qualitatively resembles the CD spectra of the β-hairpins
encompassing a type II′ β-turn described by Gibbs et
al. (Figure S25).23 The isodichroic point observed at 207 nm is indicative of a two-state
system present in both peptides. Tracking the ellipticity at 216 nm
indicates that 1 has a 13% more folded β-hairpin
structure relative to 2. PCA (Figure 4), enabling a direct comparison of the unfolding
pathways of the two peptides, shows that upon increasing the temperature,
the proportion of the random coil structure increases, as reflected
by an increase in component 1 (Figure 4), whereas that of β-turn decreases,
as reflected by an increase in component 2, for both
peptides. At high temperatures, the thermal unfolding of 1 reaches a plateau with no further loss of the β-turn element,
suggesting a more stable folded structure for 1 compared
with 2. The latter continues to increase in component 2 and thus losing β-turn even at high temperatures.
Overall, PCA indicates a more stable folded structure for 1 than 2.

Figure 3 Concentration-corrected CD data obtained for 1 and 2 acquired in the 262–342 K interval for
acetonitrile
solutions (c ≈ 44 μM, b = 2 mm) indicate that both peptides adopt a twisted antiparallel
β-hairpin conformation, with a strongly temperature-dependent
negative band at 216–220 nm, permitting a detailed thermodynamic
analysis of folding. The OH to CH3 substitution causes
a significant change in the CD spectra.

Figure 4 PCA of the CD data of 1 (diamonds) and 2 (circles) undergoing thermal unfolding from 262 to 342 K in 19 steps,
color-coded from cyan to red. The two main components, that is, the
random coil (component 1) and the β-hairpin (component 2), represent 87.2% of the observable variance. At high temperatures,
the thermal unfolding of 1 reaches a plateau with no
further loss of the β-turn element, whereas that of 2 continues to lose the β-turn content, suggesting a more stable
β-hairpin conformation for 1 compared with that
for 2.

Whereas the computational
(vide supra) and NMR spectroscopic (vide
infra) analyses were performed in DMSO, because of the lack of transparency
of DMSO in the wavelength interval typical of amide absorptions, the
CD spectra were acquired in acetonitrile. As both solvents are polar
aprotic and have similar polarity indices (DMSO, 7.2 and CH3CN, 5.8), this solvent alteration was expected to not have any major
influence on the folding of the studied systems. Accordingly, the
conclusions drawn from the CD spectroscopic analysis are in good agreement
with those of the MD and NAMFIS-based NMR analyses. Hence, CD spectroscopy
is capable of detecting the stability difference between two structurally
highly similar peptides. The different solvents used for CD as compared
with MD and NMR may, however, partially explain the slight variation
in the difference in the folding of 1 and 2, as observed using different techniques.

In contrast to CD
spectroscopy that gives one overall signal for
a studied solution, NMR spectroscopy provides detailed, atomic-level
information on the molecular structure. Peptide folding can be assessed
both qualitatively and quantitatively using 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts. 13Cβ and 13Cα structuring shifts, for example, which are defined as chemical
shift deviations (CSDs) from random coil values, are frequently used
for identifying and evaluating β-hairpin folding.13,25−28 The qualitative CSD analysis of 1 and 2 (see the Experimental Section and Supporting Information for details) indicates
β-hairpin conformation for both model peptides (Tables S6 and S7, and Figures S3 and S4). However, because the reference shifts (i.e., δrandom coil and CSD100% folded) that are
available in the literature are for aqueous solutions and/or for vastly
different sequences, they are not fully applicable to 1 and 2. For a quantitative assessment of the β-hairpin
population from structuring shifts (i.e., CSDobs/CSD100% folded), comparison with reference values obtained
for suitable control peptides under identical experimental conditions
would be needed.

Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) and J-couplings
are most commonly used to calculate interatomic distances and dihedral
angles, to describe peptide conformations.
As these are population-averaged observables,29 for the proper description of the structure of flexible molecules,
these have to be deconvoluted into the population-weighted contributions
of the NOEs and J-couplings of individual conformations
available in solution. Molecular ensembles of, for example, peptides,18,29−31 macrocycles,32−34 and drug candidates35 have been successfully identified by deconvolution
of their time-averaged NMR data using the NAMFIS algorithm (for a
detailed description of the method, see ref (29)). It uses a computationally
generated theoretical conformational pool, which covers the entire
conformational space available for a flexible molecule, and experimentally
observed time averaged structural parameters. The latter are used
for the identification of conformers present in the solution and for
the calculation of their probabilities corresponding to their molecular
fractions. Theoretical ensembles for 1 and 2 were predicted in this study using Monte Carlo conformational search
with intermediate torsion sampling, followed by molecular mechanics
energy minimization, as implemented in the software Macromodel (v.9.1).36 To ensure full coverage of the conformational
space, theoretical conformational ensembles were generated using two
different force fields, (OPLS)-2005 and Amber* (developed for peptides).
The conformations within 42 kJ/mol from the global minimum were combined
(Table S13), and redundant conformations
were eliminated using the clustering analysis using a 2.5 Å root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) cutoff for all heavy atom coordinates. These conformational
pools containing 80 and 147 conformations for 1 and 2, respectively, were used as theoretical inputs for the NAMFIS
calculations. Using experimental NOE-based distance and J-based dihedral angle data (overall 36 vs 39 restraints for 1 and 2, respectively, as given in Tables S15 and S16), NAMFIS29 identified 9 versus 11 solution conformations and computed
their molar fractions. Out of these ensembles, 58% versus 29% were
folded β-hairpins for 1 and 2 (Table S14), respectively, indicating a 29 percentage
point increased folding of the peptide capable of forming an interstrand
sidechain-to-sidechain hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond, between
S8 and S(Me)3, was present in 58% probability in the conformational
ensemble, identified on the basis of experimental NMR restraints.
The folded conformations of 1 and 2 are
shown in Figure 5 and
are apart from the presence or absence of the interchain hydrogen
bond between S8 and S(Me)3 highly similar.
The full conformational ensembles are depicted in Figures S10 and S11, with the population of the individual
solution conformers being given in Table S14. The NOE- and J-based ensemble analyses were validated
using standard methods, that is, through evaluation of the reliability
of the conformational restraints by the addition of 10% random noise
to the experimental data, by the random removal of individual restraints,
and by comparison of the experimentally observed and back-calculated
distances and scalar coupling constants as given in Tables S15 and S16.

Figure 5 Folded conformations of peptides 1 (right) and 2 (left), identified by the NAMFIS algorithm
based on an NOE
and J-based selection from a theoretical pool of
conformations generated by a restraint-free Monte Carlo conformational
search algorithm. The interstrand S8–S(Me)3 hydrogen bond was
present in 58% of the conformations of the ensemble for 1, whereas its formation is prevented for 2.

Studying the temperature dependence of NMR chemical
shifts is another
common approach for quantitating the extent of folding. Signal overlaps
and small chemical shift changes over the available temperature range,
yielding an incomplete melting curve, prohibited a detailed analysis
of the 1H NMR data of 1 and 2. Upon 13C-labeling of the A7 methyl group (Figure 1), an amino acid positioned
next to the S8–S(Me)3 interaction site and thus used as a reporter
nucleus, we obtained temperature-dependent 13C NMR data
for 1 and 2 (Figure 6 and Table S8)
and performed thermodynamic analyses, following the literature procedure
of Honda et al.37,38 Analogous to previous studies,
shallow partial thermal transition curves were observed and were analyzed
using a two-state folding model with a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting
procedure (see the Experimental Section and Supporting Information for details).37,38

Figure 6 Best
fitted curves of variable temperature (VT) 13C
NMR data for A7–13Cβ in 1 (blue)
and 2 (cyan) to eq 1 (Supporting Information). The
NMR data were acquired at 299–404 K in the DMSO-d6 solution.

For the estimation of the relative thermodynamic stability
of the
peptides, the ratio of their unfolding constants, KUP1/KUP2, is determined using eq 1. 1  

In eq 1, δU and δF are the chemical shifts of the completely
unfolded and the fully folded states of the peptide, respectively,
whereas δobs is the observed chemical shift at a
given temperature and KU is the ratio
of the unfolding constants of 1 and 2, which
are denoted as P1 and P2. Importantly, the slope of the plot (δUP1 – δobsP1)(δobsP2 – δFP2) versus (δobsP1 – δFP1)(δUP2 – δobsP2) (Figure 7) quantifies the
relative stability, here the ratio of the unfolding constants of 1 and 2. Hence, a slope greater than 1 indicates
a higher stability of 2 compared with that of 1. The plot is nonlinear because of the difference in the folding
enthalpy of the studied systems; yet, its slope can be easily determined.
As eq 1 includes chemical
shifts only, we acquired the 13C NMR shift of A7–13Cβ of 1 and 2 simultaneously
in the same solution, which maximizes the accuracy of the data by
minimizing referencing errors and errors due to differences in the
sample temperature. The obtained slope indicates a 37% higher stability
of 2 compared with that of 1, which is in
disagreement with the MD, CD, and NOE/J-based analyses.
Analysis of the CD data using the method of Honda et al.38 indicates an 8% higher folded population for 1 compared with that for 2. Following the literature,15 here we analyzed folding by following the temperature
dependence of the chemical shift of a single reporter nucleus. The
data of one selected nucleus, however, may better reflect local than
overall conformational changes. This presumption was corroborated
by a modified NAMFIS analysis including only the NOE data of A7, which
also suggested a higher folded population for 2 compared
with that of 1 (Tables S17–S19 and Figures S12 and S13). The latter
analysis indicates that great care needs to be taken when interpreting
the data of a single nucleus in a peptide or protein sequence. With
access to an 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe
with a cooled 13C preamplifier, and thus to supreme 13C NMR sensitivity, we acquired the 13C NMR shifts
of all unlabeled positions of the peptides in the temperature range
of 296–343 K (Figures S5–S7). This narrower temperature range, limited by the hardware, unfortunately
did not permit the acquisition of sufficiently large amounts of data
for a reliable thermodynamic analysis (Figures S22 and S23). No chemical shift changes larger than those observed
for the reporter nucleus of A7 were detected for the α- and
β-carbons of the unlabeled amino acids.

Figure 7 Unfolding ratio of 1 and 2, determined
using eq 1 from the VT 13C NMR measurements acquiring the chemical shift of A7–13Cβ.

3 Conclusions
Overall, the CD and NAMFIS analyses reliably reproduced the MD-predicted
higher stability of 1 compared with that of 2 and thus were shown to be applicable for the detection of changes
in the β-hairpin stability upon a minor structural alteration.
Thermodynamic analysis of the temperature-dependent variation in the 13C NMR chemical shift of a single reporter nucleus, however,
suggested an opposite trend of stability. Whereas the CD and NOE/J-based methods include data reflecting the overall conformation,
the latter chemical shift analysis reports only the changes experienced
by one atom in the peptides and thus predominantly may reflect changes
in the local environment. Our results suggest that great care has
to be taken when selecting the method for the analysis of differences
in the peptide of closely related structures. Preferably, the outcome
of several complementary techniques should be compared, and techniques
reporting the data for only single amino acids should be avoided.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Peptide Synthesis
4.1.1 General Information
Solid-phase
peptide synthesis (SPPS) was performed using an automated benchtop
peptide synthesizer. Analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (RP-HPLC)–mass spectrometry (MS) was performed
on a system with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI+ or ESI–) and a single wavelength UV detector (270
nm), using a C8-EC column (120 Å, 4 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm)
with gradients of CH3CN/H2O (0.1% HCOOH) at
a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Preparative RP-HPLC was performed on a system
with a single wavelength UV detector (220 nm), using a C18 column
(110 Å, 10 μm, 21.2 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 20
mL/min, with gradients of CH3CN/H2O (0.1% HCOOH).
Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a system with a single wavelength
UV detector (220 or 230 nm), using a C18 column (110 Å, 5 μm,
3.2 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min or a C18 column (100
Å, 3 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm) at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min,
with gradients of CH3CN/H2O (0.1% HCOOH). High-resolution
MS analyses [Q-time-of-flight (TOF)-MS] were performed at Stenhagen
Analyslab AB, Gothenburg, Sweden. All chemicals were purchased from
commercial sources and used without further purification.

4.1.2 General Procedure for Peptide Synthesis
and Purification
The linear peptide sequences were synthesized
on a 300 μmol scale following the standard Nα-Fmoc protecting
group strategy39 (Scheme S1). Before the initial coupling, the resin was swollen in
dimethylformamide (DMF) for 3 × 10 min. A mixture of the appropriate
amino acid (2 equiv), TBTU (N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium
tetrafluoroborate) (2 equiv), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA,
4 equiv) in DMF was
added to the resin, and the reaction mixture was agitated by nitrogen
bubbling. For Fmoc-[3-13C]Ala-OH, the number of equivalents
was reduced to 1.3. Double couplings were used for all amino acids
(2 × 1.5 h for Fmoc-d-Pro-OH and Fmoc-Val-OH, and 2
× 1 h for the following amino acids). Capping of unreacted sites
was performed using a mixture of acetic anhydride and DIPEA in DMF
(20 min), and Fmoc deprotection was achieved by treatment with 20%
piperidine in DMF (3 × 5 min). Before cleaving off the linear
peptide sequence, the resin was split into two batches which were
kept separated over the remaining steps (be advised that the overall
yield is calculated and specified only for one of the batches for
each peptide). The resin was treated with 1% trifluoroacetyl (TFA)
in dichloromethane (DCM, 5 × 5 min), and the resultant solutions
containing the cleaved peptide were immediately neutralized with 10%
pyridine in methanol. After evaporation under a steam of nitrogen,
keeping approximately 5% of the initial volume, cold water was added,
and the mixtures were allowed to stand in the freezer overnight. The
precipitate was filtered off, washed with water, and dried under vacuum.
Head-to-tail macrolactamization was performed in solution under dilute
conditions.40 A solution of the linear
peptide (approximately 0.01 M) in DMF and one of HATU (1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid
hexafluorophosphate) (3 equiv, approximately 0.03 M) and DIPEA (6
equiv) in DMF were mixed in a round-bottomed flask by dropwise addition
of the two solutions using a syringe pump. After completion, the reaction
mixture was filtered through a Si-carbonate column (3 equiv relative
to HATU) to remove 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole and then put on an
ice bath and slowly diluted with water to get a 30:70 mixture of DMF/water.
The mixture was passed through an endcapped RP-C18 column conditioned
with water. The column was washed with CH3CN/water at 30:70
to get rid of DIPEA and DMF, followed by CH3CN/water at
85:15 to elute the peptide. The CH3CN/water mixture was
evaporated, and the resultant solid was dried under vacuum. The cyclic
peptide was deprotected using a mixture of TFA/triisopropylsilane/H2O (95:2.5:2.5). After initial cooling on an ice bath, the
reaction mixture was allowed to attain room temperature. In total,
the reaction mixture was stirred for 2–2.5 h and then evaporated
under a nitrogen flush. Cold ether was added, and the precipitate
was filtered off, washed with ether, and dried under vacuum. The crude
peptide was purified using preparative HPLC.

4.1.3 Peptide 1c[Gly1-Gln2-Ser(Me)3-Val4-d-Pro5-Gly6-[3-13C]Ala7-Ser8-Val9-Asn10]
Peptide 1 was synthesized
and purified according to
the general procedure described above. Importantly, the initial 300
μmol was split into two batches before cleavage from the resin
and kept separated for the remaining steps (the 52% batch is reported
here). The product was isolated as a white solid (62.4 mg, 46%). MS
(ESI+) m/z: 912.6 [M
+ H]+. HRMS (ESI-Q-TOF) m/z: [M + H]+ calcd for C37(13C)H63N12O14, 912.4615; found, 912.4687.

4.1.4 Peptide 2c[Gly1-Gln2-Ser(Me)3-Val4-d-Pro5-Gly6-[3-13C]Ala7-Abu8-Val9-Asn10]
Peptide 2 was synthesized and purified according to
the general procedure described above. Importantly, the initial 300
μmol was split into two batches before cleavage from the resin
(the 51% batch is reported here) and before macrolactamization (the
48% batch is reported here) and kept separated for the remaining steps.
The product was isolated as a white solid (6.5 mg, 10%). MS (ESI+) m/z: 910.7 [M + H]+. HRMS (ESI-Q-TOF) m/z:
[M + H]+ calcd for C38(13C)H64N12O13, 910.4823; found, 910.4748.

4.2 NMR Spectroscopy
4.2.1 General
Information
DMSO-d6 was used
as the solvent in all experiments.
Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm and referenced indirectly
to tetramethylsilane (TMS) via the solvent residual signal. For VT
experiments, the chemical shifts (δ) are referenced to the spectrometer
frequency independent of the solvent and the temperature. The NMR
data was processed using the MNova software (versions 9.0 or 10.0,
Mestrelab Research). Relaxation and diffusion studies were performed
for the most concentrated samples to rule out peptide aggregation
(data not shown).

4.2.2 One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional
NMR
Data
Peptide 1 (1.0 or 1.9 mg) and peptide 2 (0.6 mg) were each dissolved in 250 μL of DMSO-d6, and NMR spectra were recorded at 298.15 K
using a 900 MHz spectrometer or at 296.15 K using a 800 MHz NMR spectrometer. 3JHNHα coupling constants
were determined using the 1H NMR spectra measured on a
400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2 were assigned following the sequential resonance
assignment strategy combining information on scalar (J) and dipolar (NOE) connectivities obtained from total correlation
spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy
(NOESY) experiments (Tables S1 and S2).41 Subsequently, the 15N and 13C NMR spectra were assigned from 15N heteronuclear single
quantum correlation(HSQC) and gHSQCAD (gradient heteronuclear single
quantum correlation using adiabatic sweep pulses) experiments,
respectively (Tables S4 and S5). Both peptides
were confirmed to adopt β-hairpin structures in DMSO-d6 on the basis of established NMR parameters
(see Supporting Information for details).

4.2.3 13Cβ and 13Cα
Structuring Shifts
For the qualitative analysis of peptides 1 and 2, 13Cβ and 13Cα CSDs were calculated using random coil values reported for
TFA-Gly1-Gly2-l-X3-l-Ala4-OCH3 tetrapeptides
(X represents one specific amino acid) dissolved in DMSO-d6 (Tables S6 and S7, and Figures S3 and S4).25 Reference values for non-natural amino acids were not available,
and therefore CSDs could not be calculated for S(Me)3 and X8. The
CSDs presented for DP5 were calculated from random coil
chemical shifts for trans proline. Furthermore, no
sequence-dependent δrandom coil values or near-neighbor
correction factors are available for peptides in DMSO-d6, which is believed to contribute to errors in the CSD
analysis.

4.2.4 VT 13C NMR
Data—A7–13Cβ Detection
Peptide 1 (2 mg)
and peptide 2 (2 mg) were each dissolved in 100 μL
of DMSO-d6. The NMR studies were carried
out at 298.98–403.83 K, with ΔT = 4
or 5 K, using a 500 MHz spectrometer (Table S8). The two peptides were analyzed simultaneously using a spinner
that can accommodate two 2.5 mm tubes.

4.2.5 VT 13C NMR Data—13Cα and 13Cβ Detection
Peptide 1 (1.9 mg) and peptide 2 (0.6 mg) were each dissolved
in 250 μL of DMSO-d6. The NMR studies
were carried out at 296.15–343.15 K, with ΔT ≈ 5 K, using an 800 MHz spectrometer (Figures S5–S7).

4.2.6 Amide
Proton Temperature Coefficients
Peptide 1 (1
mg) and peptide 2 (0.6 mg)
were each dissolved in 250 μL of DMSO-d6. Amide temperature coefficients [ΔδNH/ΔT = (δThigh – δTlow)/(Thigh – Tlow)] were determined from the 1H NMR spectra
recorded at 338.15–363.15 K (ΔT = 5
K) using a 500 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts (δ) were
referenced to the spectrometer frequency independent of the solvent
and the temperature. Peak overlapping prohibited the determination
of the coefficients for G6 and V9. Peptides (i.e., systems displaying
conformational averaging) often show exceptions to the general rules
for interpreting amide proton temperature coefficients.42,43 Therefore, great caution should be taken at all interpretations.
If ΔδNH/ΔT > −4
ppb/K, there is a high probability that the amide proton is hydrogen-bonded
(i.e., Q2 and A7, Tables S9 and S10). Plotting
δNH against temperature gave an R2 > 0.98 for A7NH in 2, and R2 > 0.99 for all other amide protons.

4.2.7 NOE Buildup Analysis
Peptide 1 (1 mg)
and peptide 2 (0.6 mg) were dissolved
in 250 μL of DMSO-d6. NOESY spectra
were recorded at 298.15 K using a 900 MHz spectrometer. NOE buildups
were recorded without solvent suppression with mixing times of 100,
200, 400, 500, 600, and 700 ms. The relaxation delay was set to 2.5
s, and 16 scans were recorded with 16 384 points in the direct
dimension and 512 points in the indirect dimension. Interproton distances
for protons i and j (rij) were calculated from the corresponding
NOE buildup rates (σij) and the
NOE buildup rate and the interproton distance for an internal distance
reference (σref and rref), according to the equation rij = rref(σref/σij)1/6. Here, the geminal protons
N10–Hβ1 and N10–Hβ2 were used as the reference
(1.78 Å). NOE buildup rates (σij) were determined using the normalized peak intensities [(cross peaki × cross peakj)/(diagonal peaki × diagonal
peakj)0.5] from the NOESY spectra
at ≥5 mixing times and assuming the initial rate approximation
to be valid. The data are presented in Tables S11 and S12 and in Figures S8 and S9.

4.3 CD Spectroscopy
Peptides 1 and 2 were each dissolved in CH3CN at a
concentration of ≈44 μM and transferred to 2 mm quartz
cuvettes. The spectra were corrected for concentration differences.
The CD spectra were recorded using a spectropolarimeter equipped with
a Peltier temperature controller at 262.15–336.15 K for 1 and 260.15–342.15 K for 2, with ΔT ≈ 5 K. A probe was placed inside of the cuvette
to record the internal sample temperature. The VT CD data are shown
in Figure 3.

4.4 Computational Conformational Analysis
Preferred low-energy
conformations for 1 and 2 were generated
by Monte Carlo conformational searching followed
by energy minimization and clustering analysis to eliminate redundant
conformations. Monte Carlo conformational searches were performed
with intermediate torsion sampling, 50 000 Monte Carlo steps,
and RMSD cutoff set to 2.0 Å and were followed by molecular mechanics
energy minimization using the software Macromodel (v.9.1) as implemented
in the Schrödinger package. Two independent conformational
searches were performed using the OPLS-2005 or Amber* force fields
combined with the generalized Born/surface area (GB/SA) water solvation
model. Energy minimization was performed using the Polak–Ribiere-type
conjugate gradient (PRCG) with maximum iteration steps set to 5000.
All conformations within 42 kJ/mol from the global minimum were combined,
and redundant conformations were eliminated by clustering analysis
using a 2.5 Å RMSD cutoff for all heavy atom coordinates. In
total, 80 and 147 conformers were identified for 1 and 2, respectively (Table S13).

4.5 Ensemble Analysis Using the NAMFIS Software
Solution ensembles were determined by fitting the experimentally
measured distances and coupling constants to those back-calculated
for computationally predicted conformations following previously described
protocols.29 Dihedral angles (φ)
were calculated from the experimental 3JHNHα coupling constants using a Karplus equation
calibrated to peptides.44,45 NOE-derived distances
are presented in Tables S15 and S16, whereas
coupling constants are presented in Table S3. The results of the NAMFIS analysis using all experimental data
are given in Table S14, the experimental
output is given in Tables S15 and S16,
and the conformers selected by NAMFIS are given in Figures S10 and S11. The results of the NAMFIS-analysis using
only the distances and couplings involving A7 are given in Table S17, the experimental output is given in Tables S18 and S19, and the conformers selected
by NAMFIS are given in Figures S12 and S13.

4.6 MD Simulations
All MD simulations
were performed with GROMACS 5.1.146,47 using the
OPLS-all atom (AA) force field.48,49 Force field parameters
for the non-natural amino acid l-2-aminobutyric acid (X8)
were derived from the parameters for leucine Cβ and isoleucine
Cγ. Force field parameters for the methylated serine [S(Me)3,
denoted Z3 in Figure S14] were derived
from serine except for the atoms of the terminal methoxy group. For
the latter, the OPLS force field parameters for ethers were used (OG:
opls_180, CD: opls_181, and HD1-3: opls_185). The charges for the
methoxymethyl moiety (i.e., CH2OCH3) were changed
to −0.4e for O, 0.14e for
C(H2), 0.11e for C(H3), and
0.03e for H, according to Kahn and Bruice.50 The parameters for the solvent DMSO were used
as implemented in GROMACS 5.1.1. Initial coordinates for the backbone
conformations of both peptides were taken from an output structure
of the NAMFIS analysis of solution NMR data of structurally similar
systems [S3 instead of S(Me)3].18 Both
peptides were solvated in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions
and a side length of 40 Å containing the peptide and approximately
440 DMSO molecules. The same MD protocol was used for both peptides.
It is described in detail elsewhere.19 Briefly,
each system was equilibrated (steepest-descend minimization, 100 ps
NVT, and 100 ps NPT equilibration). After that, a 100 ps MD simulation
with position restraints on the peptide heavy atoms was performed,
and coordinates and velocities were extracted every 10 ps. Eleven
starting structures and velocities were then used to start 400 ns
MD production runs (without restraints), yielding a total simulation
time of 4.4 μs for each peptide. MD simulations were analyzed
with a simple on/off scheme for the four backbone hydrogen bonds HB1–HB4
(Figure S14), as described previously.19 Briefly, hydrogen bonds were detected using
the Python package MDAnalysis51 with a
distance threshold of 3 Å and an angle lower limit of 120°
(θ > 120°). If these criteria are met, the hydrogen
bond
is labeled as c (closed); otherwise, it is labeled as o (open). Hydrogen
bond patterns and their percentages are shown in Table S20. All hydrogen bond patterns with three or more closed
backbone hydrogen bonds are defined as a folded structure; the remaining
hydrogen bond patterns are defined as an unfolded structure. In the
previous paper, the average hydrogen bond distance was used as the
criterion, but this would result in defining cooc as folded, whereas
it was defined earlier as unfolded.19 Thus,
the criterion used in this study results in a hydrogen bond pattern
assignment that is consistent with the previous one. In addition to
counting the occurrence of the different hydrogen bond patterns in
the MD trajectories, the transition from one hydrogen bond pattern
to another can be counted. This yields change maps that are shown
in Tables S21 and S22.

4.7 Thermodynamic Analysis
A two-state
thermodynamic equilibrium between a folded and unfolded conformational
ensemble was assumed for the thermal defolding of peptides 1 and 2.

4.7.1 VT 13C NMR
Data—A7–13Cβ Detection
The
VT 13C NMR data
was fitted to eq 2 by
applying the Levenberg–Marquandt algorithm.37,38Equation 4 is derived
from eqs 2 and 3, and describes the relationship between the equilibrium
unfolding constants KU and the observed
and limiting chemical shifts of the folded and unfolded states (δobs, δF, and δU) 2   3   4  

To evaluate the
estimated limiting
chemical shifts of the folded and unfolded states (δF and δU), the transition temperature Tm, and the change in enthalpy at the transition temperature,
ΔHm, Monte Carlo simulated noise
was applied as a noise factor.52 Because
only part of the melting curves for 1 and 2 could be acquired, constraints were added for δU to improve the accuracy of the routine. From a series of calculations
using rational values of δU (i.e., constraints) as
input and 500 MC for each step, a statistical standard deviation minimum
of 16.5 ± 0.5 ppm was determined for δU. The
smallest standard deviation ranges of Tm, which were confirmed on the other parameters as well, are shown
in Figures S18 and S19. To enhance the
statistic deviation for each of the rational values of δU (i.e., constraint), the noise factor was increased. When
data from linear peptides with the same sequence (data not shown)
were fitted to the same equation in the same way, the results were
found to agree with the cyclic peptides (i.e., δU = 16.5 ± 0.5 ppm). Histogram plots of δF,
ΔHm, and Tm, using δU = 16.5 ppm and 1000 MC steps,
are shown in Figures S20 and S21.

In the second step, the ratio of equilibrium unfolding constants
for peptide 1 (P1) and peptide 2 (P2), that
is, KUP1/P2, for the two-state transitions is estimated from the
slope of linear regression analysis of (δobsP1 – δFP1)(δUP2 – δobsP2) versus (δUP1 – δobsP1)(δobsP2 – δFP2). Equation 1 (vide supra) is derived from eqs 5–7 or from eqs 4 and 5.37,38 5   6   7  

4.7.2 VT 13C NMR
Data—13Cα and 13Cβ Detection
Shallow and
partial thermal transition curves were acquired for both 1 and 2. Representative examples are shown in Figures S22 and S23. Thus, the quality of the
VT 13Cα and 13Cβ NMR data for the
strand residues were not sufficient for extracting reliable limiting
shifts using the curve-fitting routine, which are needed to calculate
the ratio of the unfolding constants.
