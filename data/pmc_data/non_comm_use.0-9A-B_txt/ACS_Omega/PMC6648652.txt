In this work, we have calculated
several physical quantities related
to two interacting semiconductor organic molecules to reveal the significance
and the role of the side-chains. The molecular systems of our target
are the geometry-optimized dimer systems: that consisting of two [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester molecules and that consisting
of two peryline diimide-related molecules. The physical quantities
shown in the present work are their relative molecular geometries,
optimized energies, barycentric distances, angles between the two
molecular planes, dipole moments,
and electronic couplings. We have found that these physical quantities
show quite different tendencies among the systems, which results from
the absence/presence of the side-chains in these molecular species.
It is emphasized that the presence of side-chains brings about the
diversity of molecular characteristics in interacting molecules. This
may point out the importance of side-chains in the various organic
materials in general.

1 Introduction
Recently,
organic solar cells have been attracting much attention
in the effort to achieve efficient and low-cost renewable energy supply.
The prototypical organic solar cells consist of two semiconductor
organic molecules: electron-donating (donor) and electron-accepting
(acceptor) molecules. In the past few decades, almost all of the researches
have focused on the donor molecule consisting of a p-type-conjugated
polymer and the acceptor molecules consisting of an n-type fullerene
derivative. However, quite recently, nonfullerene acceptors have emerged
as a promising alternative to fullerene-based acceptor molecules.1 This is due to the diversity, easy functionalization,
low fabrication cost of the formers. Recently, the solar cell efficiency
greater than 13% has been achieved using nonfullerene acceptors,2,3 which exceeds that of fullerene-based solar cells.

In particular,
peryline diimide (PDI) has long been investigated
in detail since before the advent of organic solar cells. PDI has
several prominent features, which fullerene derivatives are devoid
of. The most striking characteristic of PDIs is that there is a strong
intermolecular π–π stacking interaction between
their rigid aromatic cores so that they tend to self-assemble into
various ordered forms.4−14 Other important merits are their low cost, high absorption coefficient,
good photochemical stability, high electron mobility, high electron
affinity, and chemical versatility.15 These
advantageous features make a series of PDI molecules useful for several
materials design.

As far as the organic solar cells nowadays
are concerned, to improve
the solar cell performance of nonfullerene-based architectures, much
endeavor has been paid to making the best of the above-mentioned advantages
as well as to functionalizing16−20 and to twisting the aromatic core plane of PDI molecules.21,22 In fact, we have witnessed the increase of the solar cell performance
utilizing these procedures.21,22 However, quite recently,
the importance of side-chains has gradually been recognized, and several
works on the subject have been published.23−27 In ref (26), it was found that three perylene diimide–spirobifuluorene
derivatives with different kinds of alkyl side-groups showed identical
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) energy levels and very similar optical properties but
different photovoltaic responses.

Using the benefit of the effect
of side-chain, side-chain engineering
has also been proposed.28

In spite
of the seemingly important role of side-chains, the quantum
chemical calculations related to organic solar cells have so far neglected
them in most of the cases, taking into account only the molecular
central core. Much emphasis has been put on the comparison and improvement
of core units of the molecules. For example, Yi et al. studied the
donor–acceptor complexes in α-sexithienyl/C60 and α-sexithienyl/PDI model systems, in which each molecule
is fixed at 3.5 Å apart neglecting the side-chains.29 Nevertheless, the arbitrariness of the values
of the intermolecular distance and orientation and the absence of
side-chains might invoke various artificial errors in the calculations.
Note that not only the intermolecular distance but also the intermolecular
orientation are very important for estimating the photoinduced charge-transfer
kinetics of donor–acceptor arrays.30

Instead, in this work, we have performed the full geometry
optimization
(including side-chains) from a variety of initial guess intermolecular
configurations as a first step using the quantum chemical approach.
Then, we have classified globally and locally stable bimolecular states.
Finally, we have calculated important physical quantities such as
barycentric distances, angles between the molecular planes, dipole
moments, and electronic couplings of two interacting molecules have
been evaluated.

2 Theoretical Details
To obtain the optimized molecular geometries and to evaluate barycentric
distances, angles between the molecular planes, dipole moments, and
electronic couplings of two interacting molecules, the Gaussian16
suite of programs31 was used to carry out
all of the quantum chemistry calculations shown below.

The semiempirical
methods are extremely useful for medium to large
molecules at the sacrifice of the accuracy that is fairly comparable
to any other quantum chemistry methods. It was shown that PM632 predicts gas-phase heats of formation fairly
accurately.33 In connection with the computational
elucidation and numerical design of organic materials, the adequacy
of semiempirical methods was investigated.34 In another report, the performance of semiempirical and density
functional methods (B3LYP, PM6, and PM7) was compared for reproducing
solar cell efficiencies such as open circuit voltages (Voc) of C60 fullerene derivatives, e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).35 In the report, it was shown that although B3LYP showed the best
performance in the principal component analysis (PCA), PM6 and PM7
were satisfactory in PCA. In particular, although PM6 is not recommended
due to the overestimation of Voc, PM7
is suitable for preliminary estimations of Voc and electron binding energies of fullerene derivatives.
Therefore, we adopt the PM7-D method to approximately evaluate all
of the physical quantities related to two interacting semiconductor
molecules in this work as well.

The scheme of our optimization
procedure is demonstrated in Figure 1. Our calculations
start from only one initial arbitrary given relative configurations
of two molecules. Various initial guess internal positions of the
atoms in each molecule are calculated from the initial arbitrary given
relative configurations of two molecules by the relative angles (the
Euler angles) with regard to the line between the barycenters of two
molecules 1  where (x,y,z) is the initial Cartesian coordinate of the atom
calculated from the preliminary optimization of one molecule by PM7-D,
(x0,y0,z0) is the initial coordinate of the barycenter
of the molecule, (xint,yint,zint) is the internal
guess internal coordinate of the atom, and (ϕ,ψ,θ)
is the Euler angle. In other words, various initial guess positions
of the atoms are calculated by the seven parameters: the barycenter
distance between the two molecules, r, and the two
sets of Euler angles for each molecule, (ϕ1,ψ1,θ1), (ϕ2,ψ2,θ2) once the initial arbitrary given relative configurations
of two molecules is chosen.

Figure 1 Geometry optimization of two nonfullerene acceptor
molecules using
the initial guesses of the barycentric distance, three relative angles
for each molecule, and molecular structure of each molecule.

In our present calculations, the
parameters lie in the following
regions 2  In eq 2, r, is
evenly divided into three segments
and the remaining angular parameters into five segments, the geometry
optimizations amounting up to 3 × 53 × 53 = 46 875 for one bimolecular system.

3 Results and Discussion
In this study, we are interested
in the bimolecular systems of
PCBM, PDI, EP-PTC investigated in ref (36) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide
(hereafter, called PDI 1 as in ref (21)). The reason why we have
chosen these systems will become evident from the calculations shown
below.

In Figure 2, the
optimized molecular structures of PCBM, PDI, EP-PTC, and PDI 1 are demonstrated. As is well known, PCBM contains the sphere
composed of C60 as a core and an alkyl and a phenyl side-chains.
Panel (a) actually shows that this is the case. On the other hand,
panels (b)–(d) show that PDI-related molecules have a planar
aromatic core in common. From the completely different forms of the
core of PCBM- and PDI-related molecules, one can imagine that these
two types of molecules will behave quite differently. Therefore, comparing
the results of (a) and those of (b)–(d), the difference between
the fullerene and nonfullerene will become clear.

Figure 2 Geometry-optimized structures
of (a) PCBM, (b) PDI, (c) EP-PTC,
and (d) PDI 1.

On the other hand, panels (b)–(d) differ only in terms
of
the side-chains. PDI (panel (b)) is devoid of alkyl chains, whereas
PDI 1 (panel (d)) has a side-chain longer than EP-PTC
(panel (c)) does. Therefore, comparing panels PDI, EP-PTC, and PDI 1, one can concentrate on the investigation of the effect
of the side-chains.

From Figure 2, another
striking feature worthy of detailed investigation in our molecular
systems is that the side-chains of the PDI-related molecules are directed
almost perpendicular to the plane of the stable aromatic core (panels
(c) and (d)). This is a commonly observed feature in an electron-rich
core with perpendicular side-chains.37 Although
this feature has not been investigated in detail so far, it will be
important to get insight on how this phenomenon takes place.

Figure 3 shows the
dependence of energy on the rotational angle of a side-chain. One
can see that in both panels (a) and (b), as the angle increases up
to around 100 or 120°, the energy increases. As the angle further
increases up to 180°, the energy instead decreases, and the energy
returns to the original stable value at the angle 180°. In fact,
this clearly shows that the configurations with the side-chains perpendicular
to the molecular plane are the most stable in both EP-PTC and PDI 1. This provides one of the examples showing that it is energetically
important at which angle the side-chain is attached to the main part
of the molecule.

Figure 3 Dependence of energy on the rotational angle of a side-chain
for
(a) EP-PTC and (b) PDI 1. The insets show the directional
arrows of the rotations of the side-chains.

Another important characteristic to note is that the rotational
energy barrier is higher in the case of the bulkier alkyl chain (panel
(b)) than in the case of the less bulky side-chain (panel (a)). Because
the differences of the energy barriers in panels (a) and (b) (around
1 eV) are comparable to the stabilization energies in the bimolecular
systems shown below (up around 1–2 eV), the difference of rotational
energy barriers in panels (a) and (b) caused by the different kinds
of side-chains cannot be neglected. In particular, Figure 3 shows that bulky side-chains
may influence the whole molecular characteristics to a large extent.
This provides one of the examples showing the importance of the difference
of the side-chain in a single molecular system although the side-chain
is often overlooked in numerical calculations.29

In general, rotational barriers are originated from
either steric
repulsion or hyperconjugation.38 Because
there is apparently no steric bulkiness between two alkyl groups in
EP-PTC and PDI 1, the rotational barriers in Figure 3 seem to stem from
the hyperconjugation.

For the subsequent calculations of physical
quantities of our interest,
4688, 35, and 1537 converged geometries for PCBM, PDI, and PDI 1 are chosen from the geometry optimizations mentioned at
the end of Section 2. These values already indicate that PDI may contain a small number
of bimolecular configurations, whereas PCBM and PDI 1, a lot of configurations, as shown in detail below.

In Figure 4, we
show the dependence of (a) barycentric distance, (b) angle between
the two molecular planes, (c) dipole moment, and (d) electronic coupling
on the stabilization energy of bimolecular PCBM system. From panel
(a), it is seen that as the stabilization energy (hereafter, note
that the stabilization energy is meant to the absolute value of the
energy value on the abscissa) increases, the barycentric distance
decreases, which shows a large value of the correlation function (0.788;
see Table 1). Referring
to the molecular configurations shown in (i)–(v), one can see
that as the stabilization energy increases, the two molecules approach
each other gradually and they begin to interact with each other via
the van der Waals interactions through the side-chains. The strong
intermolecular interaction via the side-chains is seen for the geometries,
(i)–(iii). For the geometries (iv) and (v), there may be intermolecular
interactions but through seemingly week long-range van der Waals interactions
via the side-chain of one PCBM and C60 of the other PCBM,
which leads to a slight stabilization energy, as shown in panels (a)–(d).

Figure 4 Dependence
of (a) barycentric distance, (b) angle between the two
molecular planes, (c) dipole moment, and (d) electronic coupling on
the stabilization energy of the bimolecular PCBM system. In addition,
representative bimolecular geometries at the corresponding energies
are shown by numbers (i)–(v).

Table 1 Correlation Functions for Figures 4–6a
panel	(a)	(b)	(c)	(d)	
Figure 4	0.788	–0.0508	0.146	–0.300	
Figure 5	0.537	0.440	0.000396	0.133	
Figure 6	0.821	0.551	0.363	–0.613	
a If the value of the correlation
function approaches either −1 or 1, there is a strong correlation
between the two variables. On the other hand, if it approaches 0,
there is no correlation.

On the other hand, from panel (b), in the strong stabilization
energy region (−1.2 to −1.0 eV), there is a slight correlation
between the angle between the two molecular planes and the stabilization
energy (correlation function ∼ −0.304), but in the weak
stabilization energy region (−1.0–0 eV), almost no correlation
(correlation function ∼ −0.00226). This is because the
side-chains interact with each other strongly in the strong stabilization
energy region, which leads to restricted relative molecular configurations
with restricted relative orientation. On the other hand, in the weak
stabilization energy region, the intermolecular interaction is so
weak that the molecules orient themselves rather freely. Therefore,
there are a variety of relative intermolecular orientations in the
weak stabilization energy region.

From panels (c) and (d), we
can see that the correlations smaller
than those shown in panels (a) and (b) in Figure 4 exist between the dipole moment and the
stabilization energy and between the electronic coupling and the stabilization
energy (see Table 1). The dipole moment is a vectorial physical quantity so that the
complicated pattern exhibited in panel (c) reflects the free orientational
dependence of the relative position exhibited in panel (b). Note that
not only the barycentric distance but also the relative orientation
play a pivotal role in determining the electronic coupling, because
the overlap of wavefunctions of the two molecule is important in determining
the strength of the electronic coupling.39 Therefore, a variety of relative orientations shown in panel (b)
leads to various strengths of electronic couplings shown in panel
(d).

One of the interesting features peculiar to bimolecular
PCBM system
is that there is hardly bimolecular combinations between the stabilization
energies of −0.4 and −0.3 eV. Referring to the molecular
configurations of (iii) and (iv), this restriction seems to stem from
the structural hindrance caused by the presence of the side-chain
of one PCBM sandwiched between the two C60 spheres.

Next, in Figure 5,
we show the dependence of (a) barycentric distance, (b) angle between
the two molecular planes, (c) dipole moment, and (d) electronic coupling
on stabilization of bimolecular PDI system. One of the striking features
of this system is that there are much less bimolecular configurations
compared with bimolecular PCBM system shown in Figure 4. This is due to the well-known fact that
there is a very strong intermolecular π–π stacking
interaction between their rigid aromatic cores.4−14 This can also be seen from the relative molecular configurations
(i) and (ii) in Figure 5. In particular, the molecular configuration (i) corresponds to the
most stable configuration, which is reflected in the two neatly matched
parallel molecular planes. The molecular configuration (ii) has a
little bit unmatched staggered molecular planes so that it has a slightly
smaller stabilization energy.

Figure 5 Dependence of (a) barycentric distance, (b)
angle between the two
molecular planes, (c) dipole moment, and (d) electronic coupling on
the stabilization energy of the bimolecular PDI system. In addition,
representative bimolecular geometries at the corresponding energies
are shown by numbers (i)–(v).

Panel (a) shows that as the stabilization energy increases,
the
barycentric distance tends to decrease. Unlike the case seen in panel
(a) of Figure 4, instead
of the influence of the side-chain (in PDI, there is no side-chain),
this is because the strong intermolecular π–π stacking
interaction between their rigid aromatic cores becomes weaker as the
barycentric distance grows.

On the other hand, from panel (b),
unlike the panel (b) of Figure 4, there is a correlation
between the angle between the two molecular planes and the stabilization
energy over a wide range of stabilization energy (compare the value
of the correlation function of −0.508 for panel (b) of Figure 4 and that of 0.440
for panel (b) of Figure 5, as shown in Table 1). This is because the very strong intermolecular π–π
stacking interaction between their rigid aromatic cores restricts
the two molecules to be almost parallel (angle ∼ 0°) until
the intermolecular interaction can be negligible (until stabilization
energy ∼0.5 eV). As the stabilization energy decreases, the
intermolecular π–π stacking interaction becomes
weaker so that the two molecules can take on a variety of relative
orientations at around the stabilization energy ∼−0.4
eV.

From panels (c) and (d), similar to panels (c) and (d) of Figure 4, we can see that
the correlations much smaller than those shown in panels (a) and (b)
in Figure 5 exist between
the dipole moment and the stabilization energy and between the electronic
coupling and the stabilization energy (see Table 1). As mentioned before, the dipole moment
is a vectorial physical quantity. In addition, as exemplified by the
molecular configuration (ii), which has unmatched staggered molecular
planes, there may be a slight change of the direction and/or the strength
of dipole moments among the various bimolecular configurations. On
the other hand, as remarked in connection with panel (4) of Figure 4, the overlap of
wavefunctions of two molecules is determined by relative orientations
of the wavefunctions of molecules. Therefore, a slightly staggered
configuration leads to an electronic coupling quite different from
that of the neatly matched parallel bimolecular systems. From the
above reasons, we can hardly see correlations between the dipole moment
and the electronic coupling and the stabilization energy.

Finally,
in Figure 6, we show
the dependence of (a) barycentric distance, (b) angle between
the two molecular planes, (c) dipole moment, and (d) electronic coupling
on the stabilization energy of bimolecular PDI 1 system.
From panel (a), it is clearly seen that as the stabilization energy
increases, the barycentric distance decreases over a wide stabilization
energy range of −2.2 to −0.5 eV, which shows a large
value of the correlation function (0.821; see Table 1). This is also due to the well-known strong
intermolecular π–π stacking interaction between
the rigid aromatic cores of PDI derivatives. This can also be seen
from the relative molecular configurations (i) and (ii) in Figure 6. In particular,
the molecular configuration (i) corresponds to the most stable configuration,
which is reflected in the two neatly matched parallel molecular planes.
The molecular configuration (ii) has a little bit unmatched staggered
molecular planes so that it has a slightly smaller stabilization energy.
These tendencies certainly resemble those of panel (a) of Figure 5. But it should be
noticed that even if the side-chains of PDI 1 seem to
be very bulky as pointed out in the panel (b) of Figure 3, the bulkiness is not so large
as to distort the most stable bimolecular geometry of (i) in Figure 6 far from that of Figure 5. In fact, in most
of the cases, the bimolecular geometries in the stabilization energy
interval of ∼2.3 to −1.3 eV in panel (a) of Figure 6 and those in the
interval of −1.0 to −0.75 eV in panel (a) of Figure 5 are similar. But
the bimolecular geometries in the stabilization energy interval of
−1.3 to 0.0 eV in panel (a) of Figure 6 are very peculiar to PDI 1.
As can be seen from the bimolecular geometries, (iii)–(v),
these arise from the intermolecular interactions between the molecular
core of one molecule and the side-chain of the other molecule and
from those between the side-chains of each molecule. In fact, these
cannot arise for PDI, which involves no side-chains.

Figure 6 Dependence of (a) barycentric
distance, (b) angle between the two
molecular planes, (c) dipole moment, and (d) electronic coupling on
the stabilization energy of the bimolecular PDI 1 system.
In addition, representative bimolecular geometries at the corresponding
energies are shown by numbers (i)–(v).

On the other hand, from panel (b), there seems to be a correlation
between the angle between the two molecular planes and the stabilization
energy over a wide range of stabilization energy (correlation function
∼ 0.551 from Table 1). This is also because of the very strong intermolecular
π–π stacking interaction between their rigid aromatic
cores over the large stabilization energy region. However, there are
much more bimolecular geometries, i.e., dots in the figures, which
have no counterpart in the panel (b) of Figure 5. This is due to the fact that the presence
of side-chains makes various patterns of intermolecular interactions
to occur, in particular, interactions involving weak van der Waals
interactions via side-chains.

From panels (c) and (d), unlike
panels (c) and (d) of Figure 5, there seem to be
a correlation between the dipole moment and the stabilization energy
and that between the electronic coupling and the stabilization energy
(compare the value of the correlation function of 0.000396 for panel
(c) and that of 0.113 for panel (d) of Figure 5 and that of 0.363 for panel (c) of Figure 6 and that of −0.616
of panel (d) of Figure 6 as shown in Table 1). As mentioned before, the dipole moment and the electronic coupling
are affected not only by the intermolecular distance but also by the
intermolecular orientation. The bulky side-chains in Figure 6 are large and influential
enough to cause a variety of bimolecular distances and orientations
to take place. But in some cases, some geometrical hindrance, e.g.,
the absence of bimolecular PCBM configurations between the stabilization
energies of −0.4 to −0.3 eV, as mentioned before, may
also occur for PDI 1. For example, this seems to be reflected
in the absence of the geometries corresponding to the dipole moment
of 0.0–1.0 Debye in the stabilization energy interval of −1.5
to −0.5 eV in the panel (c) of Figure 6.

All in all, each panel of Figure 6 is an extension
of the counterpart of Figure 5. This points out that the
molecular characteristics of the core play an important role in determining
multimolecular behaviors. However, the prominent feature that cannot
be ignored as much as this is that the presence of the side-chain
brings about the diversity of the multimolecular characteristics that
are absent in the absence of the side-chains. This is reflected in
the much more dots present in Figure 6 than those in Figure 5.

As a final remark, some more general conclusions
from the comparison
of Figures 4–6 will be given:(1) All of the panels (a) show the tendency
similar to that of the panel (b) of Figure S5 of ref (40). This
is quite a reasonable result. In other words, if the barycentric distance
increases, the intermolecular stabilizing interaction decreases so
that the stabilization energy decreases.

(2) From the comparison of electronic
couplings shown in panel (d), the electronic couplings of a series
of PDI molecules (0.0–0.1 eV) are much larger than those of
PCBM molecules (0.0–0.007 eV). This is indicative of the fact
that the formers have much larger electron mobilities than the latter.

(3) As far as the organic
solar cells
concerned, increased complexity of the distribution of the data corresponds
to the increasing number of the amorphous structures with the increasing
complexity of the side-chain in disordered films.41,42 Therefore, it may be no wonder that the introduction of linear alkyl
chains brings about a drastic change in polymer orientation, leading
to the alteration of the charge transport in solar cells.43 In addition, it is clear that the side-chains
serve to avoid the aggregation and crystallization of PDIs at the
interface, which will lead to a better device performance.

(4) As mentioned in Introduction,
in ref (26), it was
found that three
perylene diimide–spirobifuluorene derivatives with different
kinds of alkyl side-groups showed identical HOMO/LUMO energy levels
and very similar optical properties but different photovoltaic responses.
This may be due to the fact that the intermolecular side-chain interactions
bring about a variety of intermolecular configurations as shown in
our calculations and, therefore, the molecular systems in ref (26) have taken full advantage
of the merits both of the fullerene derivatives and of PDI mentioned
in this work.



4 Conclusions
The main purpose of the present work was to point out the effect
of side-chains in the various organic materials in general. To show
that by quantum chemistry method, we calculated several physical quantities
related to two interacting organic semiconductor molecules to reveal
the significance and the role of the side-chains. The molecular systems
of our target were the geometry-optimized dimer systems: that consisting
of two PCBM molecules and that consisting of two PDI-related molecules.
The physical quantities shown in the present work are their relative
molecular geometries, optimized energies, barycentric distances, angles
between the two molecular planes, dipole moments, and electronic couplings.
The emphasis was put on the important influence of the molecular core
and the side-chains on the molecular characteristics of the multimolecular
system. In particular, from our calculations, it turned out that the
presence of the side-chain brings about the diversity of the multimolecular
characteristics that are absent in the absence of the side-chains.
This was due to the intermolecular van der Waals interactions between
the side-chains, which yield various patterns of intermolecular configurations.
This implies the importance of side-chains in the organic materials
in general. For example, as far as organic solar cells are concerned,
a variety of the nonfullerene bimolecular configurations shown in Figure 6 will contribute
a lot in disordered films in organic solar cells.

In fact, it
was pointed out that the molecular orientation is very
important for ultrafast energy transfer at organic semiconductor interfaces.44 Our study showed that one of the reasons for
the determination of relative molecular orientation is how the side-chains
of one molecule interact with those of the other molecule. This has
a great impact not only on the single molecular structure but also
on the molecular packing and the charge transport properties. This
also indicates the importance of the side-chain affecting the solar
cell characteristics.

Finally, as pointed out by Pollino et
al.,45 after the traditional covalent-based
synthetic strategies become
mature, the “noncovalent”-based strategies using the
side-chain interactions will turn out to be an alternative route in
the materials engineering including the organic solar cells discussed
in the present work.
