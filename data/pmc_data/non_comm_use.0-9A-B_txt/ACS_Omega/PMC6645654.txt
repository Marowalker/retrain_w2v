The
distribution coefficients and selectivities required for extraction
purposes were predicted with a thermodynamic equation of state for
the ternary system formic acid/water/extraction solvent. These predictions
were validated with experimental data from the literature and experimental
data from the oxidation of biomass to formic acid process measured
in this work. Extraction solvents discussed in this work are 1-butanol,
1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, ethyl n-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-butyl
ether, benzyl formate, and heptyl formate. The considered temperature
ranged from 273 to 363 K under atmospheric pressure. Perturbed-chain
statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) was used for prediction
purposes applying an approach as simple as possible and as complex
as necessary to achieve trustworthy data for selecting the best extraction
solvent. Using PC-SAFT allowed identifying 1-hexanol as the most promising
solvent out of the 11 extraction agents. The predicted data were in
good agreement with the experimental distribution coefficients and
the selectivities, which are very sensitive to experimental uncertainties.

1 Introduction
The significance of replacing fossil-based energy systems with
renewables has increased considerably in the last few years. The upcoming
requirements for sustainable production of chemicals will lead to
an increasing substitution of fossil fuels by biorenewable feedstock.
This fact makes the research for alternative renewable energy sources
more and more essential.1 In this context,
the group of Wasserscheid and Albert presented a catalytic reaction
system that converts biomass selectively into formic acid (FA), which
is called the “OxFA process”.2−5 This exothermic selective biomass
oxidation process operates under mild conditions below 373 K at typically
20–30 bar oxygen pressure in homogeneous media. As water is
used as green and benign solvent in combination with molecular oxygen
or synthetic air as oxidizing agent, this process is highly sustainable.
Moreover, biomass of different origin, composition, and humidity can
be applied without necessary pretreatment. Furthermore, FA is produced
as the only product in liquid phase at full conversion and therefore
tedious separation processes can be avoided.4,5 The
only side product is pure CO2 that is formed in the gas
phase and can be reused for the production of new biomass substrate,
i.e., algae. The isolated product FA can be used in a broad range
of applications such as platform chemical for transfer hydrogenations,
silage preservation agent in the agricultural industry, additive for
rubber applications, or drilling fluid in fracking.6 Moreover, FA is intensively discussed as a suitable storage
compound for renewable hydrogen as it is liquid, only mildly toxic,
and easy to handle under ambient conditions.7 The unique nature of FA allows either easy
and selective decomposition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) through metal-catalyzed processes under very mild conditions8 or thermally induced decomposition to carbon
monoxide and water at higher temperatures.9

The selective catalytic oxidation of biomass to FA is predominantly
dependent on the selection of the right catalyst. In the previous
studies, Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs) of the series [H3+nPVnMo12–nO40] (also known as HPA-n) have been reported to be appropriate for the reaction under consideration.2,9 Briefly, polyoxometalates (POMs) are well-defined metal oxyanions
linked with oxygen bridges of early transition metals, and they can
also contain heteroatoms to improve their chemical and thermal stabilities.10 POMs are specially resistant against hydrolytic
and oxidative degradations.11

Astonishingly,
Albert et al. could demonstrate that in situ extraction
of the formed FA from the aqueous reaction mixture using long-chain
primary alcohols has a very positive effect on the overall FA yield.12 This very surprising effect can be explained
by a pH drop during the FA formation in the aqueous reaction phase
that lowers the catalyst selectivity. This negative influence can
be overcome by using a biphasic reaction system, where the pH level
of the aqueous reaction phase is kept constant as the formed FA is
partially extracted into the organic alcohol phase. So far, both catalytic
activity and an improved selectivity of the POM-catalyzed reaction
system can be realized using this approach. Using this straightforward
in situ extraction system with 1-hexanol as the best-performing extracting
agent, maximum FA yields of 85% from glucose and 61% from water-insoluble
beech could be realized.12

Besides
a suitable catalyst, finding the best extraction solvent
is a time-consuming task. For that purpose, usually experiments are
designed, which are chosen by experienced engineers. However, the
amount of possible extraction solvents is very large and thus methods
have been developed toward an easier, faster, and less expensive way
of rating extraction solvents. Among such methods, Hansen solubility
parameters,13 Robbins chart of solute–solvent
interaction14 for qualitative indication,
modified separation of cohesive energy density,15 or thermodynamic models can be found.16 The latter are able to correlate or predict liquid–liquid
phase equilibria (LLE), which finally allow calculating distribution
coefficients and selectivity. On the basis of these properties, the
thermodynamically optimal extraction solvent can be found. In recent
years, the LLE of the ternary system FA/water/extraction solvent has
been investigated experimentally and correlated with various thermodynamic
models. Senol17 measured the LLE of FA/water/1-octanol
and modeled the data using the model universal quasi-chemical functional
group activity coefficients (UNIFACs) and solvation energy relation
for liquid-associated system. The model proved to be moderately accurate.
Özmen18 evaluated the universal
quasi-chemical (UNIQUAC) and nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) models for
the modeling of LLE of FA/water/dimethyl maleate, whereas Bilgin and
Birman19 used UNIQUAC to model the system
with the extraction solvent diethyl maleate. Gilani and Asan16 measured the systems FA/water/aliphatic alcohols
(1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-heptanol) and correlated
the experimental LLE using NRTL and UNIQUAC. All previously mentioned
investigations were done at 298 K under atmospheric pressure. Nevertheless,
some temperature-dependent LLE data were measured by Gilani and Azadian20 for FA/water/1-decanol between 298 and 323 K
under atmospheric pressure. However, this is still far off the reaction
conditions obtained in Reichert et al.,12 which are 363 K under 20 bar oxygen pressure. All of these works
have in common that they utilize activity-coefficient models (NRTL,
UNIFAC, UNIQUAC), which are indeed state of the art in chemical industry.
One drawback of these activity-coefficient models is that they require
binary interaction parameters, which are usually fitted to LLE data
of ternary systems. For the solvent-screening process, the experimental
effort for obtaining binary mixture parameters is huge and, as a result,
these activity-coefficient models only allow correlating considered
systems.

To avoid the inevitable requirement of this cost-intensive
and
time-intensive experimental effort, predictive methods have been developed
in the past decades. Examples are conductor like screening model for
realistic solvents21 and group contribution
methods like statistical association fluid theory (SAFT)-γ-Mie.22 In this work, the equation of state perturbed-chain
statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) was used to predict
LLE in the ternary systems FA/water/extraction solvent. PC-SAFT has
shown to be very promising for predicting LLE of ternary systems,
as demonstrated by the work of the group of Held and Sadowski23−27 and others.28−30

In this work, PC-SAFT was used to predict the
distribution coefficients
and selectivities of biogenic FA from the oxidation of biomass to
formic acid (OxFA) process between aqueous reaction media and organic
extraction solvent for one of the following extraction solvents: di-n-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, ethyl n-butyl ether, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol,
1-decanol, benzyl formate, and heptyl formate, according to Reichert
et al.12 All investigations were performed
under atmospheric pressure. The PC-SAFT predictions were validated
with experimental data from the literature and from this work. The
focus was keeping the amount of experimental input data to a minimum
extent while still generating accurate predictions. The work first
compares PC-SAFT predictions with experimental results of artificial
model systems16,20 under isothermal conditions,
prior to evaluating the temperature influence on the system at different
temperatures. Finally, PC-SAFT was applied to predict distribution
coefficients and extraction selectivities of biogenic FA from the
OxFA process between aqueous reaction media and organic extraction
phase. Additionally, the influence of the homogeneous HPA-5 (H8PV5Mo7O40) catalyst (present
in the aqueous phase) on the experimental distribution coefficients
and extraction selectivities was investigated with data stemming from
real reaction mixtures at 363 K and validated with PC-SAFT.

2 Methods
2.1 Distribution Coefficients
and Selectivities
On the basis of experimental LLE data of
ternary mixtures, the
sensitive properties distribution coefficient DFAexp and selectivity SFA,H2Oexp were calculated 1   2  where cFA is the
molar concentration of formic acid in the extraction solvent-rich
or the water-rich phase. The distribution coefficient for water DH2Oexp was calculated as follows 3  where cH2O is the molar concentration of
water in the extraction solvent-rich
phase (“extr”) or the water-rich phase (“aq”).

The intention is to select an extraction solvent with a high miscibility
of FA and a low solubility of water. Consequently, high DFA values and high SFA,H2O values are desired for optimal separation.

2.2 Thermodynamic Modeling Using PC-SAFT
To model phase
equilibrium such as LLE using PC-SAFT, the residual
Helmholtz energy, ares, which serves as
a basis for all calculations, is used. 4  The residual Helmholtz energy in eq 4 is expressed as the sum
of different
Helmholtz-energy contributions caused by hard-chain repulsion ahc, dispersion adisp, and hydrogen bonding aassoc. For further
information, the reader is referred to the original publications by
Gross and Sadowski.31,32 Multipolar and ionic effects
were not considered in this work. Water, FA, and alcohols were modeled
as associating fluids according to the 2B association scheme with
two association sites, which are one proton donor and one proton acceptor,
each. To characterize a self-associating component, five pure-component
parameters are required: segment diameter σi, segment number miseg, dispersion-energy
parameter ui/kb, association-energy parameter ϵAiBi/kb, and association-volume parameter
κAiBi. Components that do not interact via self-association
are characterized with three pure-component parameters σi, miseg, and ui/kb.

The segment diameter and the dispersion-energy parameter
of a mixture were calculated by applying the conventional combining
rules of Lorentz46 and Berthelot.47 5   6  In eq 6, kij is the
binary interaction parameter, which might be used to correct deviations
of the mixture parameters from the means of the pure-component parameters.
The cross-association parameters ϵAiBj and κAiBj were
calculated using the formalism by Wolbach and Sandler.48 7   8  All interaction parameters used in
this work
are only valid with the corresponding pure-component parameters listed
in Table 1.

2.2.1 Liquid–Liquid Equilibria
The LLE of multicomponent
systems was modeled on the basis of solving
the isofugacity criterion between the two liquid phases according
to 9  with the mole fraction xi and the fugacity coefficient φi of component i. PC-SAFT
was applied to predict fugacity coefficients in mixtures, which depend
on the kind of components, mixture composition, density, and temperature.
To calculate the molar fractions of the two coexisting phases at equilibrium, eq 9 was solved iteratively,
which required good starting values. To generate good starting values,
the Gibbs free-energy difference Δg was minimized.
The stability criterion of a heterogeneous system can be formulated
as 10  In eq 10, g describes the Gibbs free energy of the
system, if it stays homogenous; the sum identifies the Gibbs free
energy if the system separates into more than one phase. Thus, if
Δg in eq 10 becomes negative, the system splits into two phases,
where ax,I describes the molar phase fraction of phase I and π denotes the number of phases present.

2.2.2 Distribution Coefficients and Selectivities
PC-SAFT
was used to predict the molar fraction of each component
in the two liquid phases, which were then converted to distribution
coefficients DFAPC-SAFT and DH2OPC-SAFT with 11   12  where xi is the molar fraction of component i in the
extraction solvent-rich phase or the water-rich phase and ρ
is the density of the equilibrium phase, which was predicted using
PC-SAFT in this work. This is a valid method as the accuracy of the
density predictions of liquid equilibrium phases was confirmed by
Reschke et al. for complex systems.33 The
molar mass M̅ of the phases was calculated
by eq 13 using the molar
fraction xi and the molar
mass Mi of each component. 13  The predicted selectivity SFA,H2OPC-SAFT is defined in analogy to eq 2.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 PC-SAFT Results
PC-SAFT was used
to model the LLEs of all binary and ternary systems considered in
this work to predict DFA and SFA,H2O. Prior to predicting the latter, PC-SAFT
parameters were required. All pure-component parameters and their
references are listed in Table 1. Prior to predicting LLE in ternary systems FA/water/extraction
solvent, the LLE between water and each of the extraction solvents
was modeled with PC-SAFT. For this purpose, kij values were fitted to experimental LLE
data of binary systems water/extraction solvent. The deviations between
PC-SAFT-predicted LLE and experimental LLE data were minimized and
evaluated in terms of the average relative deviation (ARD), which
was calculated as 14  where NP is the number of
data points and wi is
the mass fraction of a
component i. To accurately model temperature-dependent
LLE, the binary interaction parameter kij was assumed to depend linearly on temperature 15  The results
for the kij values obtained
by minimizing the ARD in eq 14 using the experimental
data with references are listed in Table 2.

with the pure-component parameters given in Table 1.

Having the pure-component and binary PC-SAFT parameters at hand, DFAPC-SAFT and SFA,H2OPC-SAFT values were predicted.
In the following, the prediction results are divided into artificial
modeling systems FA/water/extraction solvent at 298 K (Section 3.1.1), at temperatures
up to 363 K that also might contain catalyst (Section 3.1.2), as well as for the
real reaction mixture containing catalyst (Section 3.1.3).

3.1.1 DFA and SFA,H2O of the
Artificial Model System
at 298 K
In a first step of this work, the LLE of the ternary
model system FA/water/alcohol was predicted with PC-SAFT at 298 K
under atmospheric pressure. In this artificial system, catalyst was
not present during the experimental measurements. Experimental data
were available from the literature for FA/water/X, with X being one of the extraction solvents (1-butanol,
1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-heptanol) by Gilani and Asan,16 as well as for X = 1-decanol
by Gilani and Azadian.20 It was found that
the LLE of these mixtures were modeled accurately by fitting one binary kij between FA and water to
data of the ternary system FA/water/1-butanol, which thus presents
the reference correlation system. The slope of the tie lines as well
as the equilibrium weight fractions in the nonaqueous phase was modeled
accurately using this approach. The same kij between FA and water was used to predict LLE of
all other ternary systems FA/water/alcohol. For the system FA/water/1-decanol,
an additional immiscibility between FA and 1-decanol was found from
experimental data, which required adjusting one kij between FA and 1-decanol to LLE data
of the binary mixture FA/1-decanol. All of these kij values are given in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the comparison of DFAexp with DFAPC-SAFT. It can be seen that for 1-butanol DFAexp is correlated
well with DFAPC-SAFT and the predicted values of DFAPC-SAFT for the other alcohols are in excellent agreement with the experimental
values. For increasing C-chain length of the alcohols, the DFAexp values are decreasing, which is caused by the decreasing slope of
the tie line from water to the extraction solvent. The decrease of D values with increasing C-chain length has been already
observed in the extraction of acetic acid with 1-alkanols.49 Further, D values of 1-butanol
were found to be much higher than those of 1-pentanol (and of 1-propanol)
in the extraction of paracetamol from aqueous solution under salting-out
conditions.50

acid between extraction phase and aqueous phase in ternary system

various extraction solvents: 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol,
and 1-decanol. Feed composition (FA/water/solvent in wt %) is 10/45/45.

The ternary LLE including tie lines can be accurately predicted
by PC-SAFT. Figure 2 compares SFA,H2OPC-SAFT and SFA,H2Oexp for various alcohols. It can be observed from Figures 1 and 2 that the system with 1-decanol differs significantly from
the systems containing other 1-alcohols under investigation. The selectivity
and distribution coefficients become comparatively small values. This
unexpected experimental behavior can be predicted with PC-SAFT accurately
in the mixture with 1-decanol. The reason behind such experimental
behavior is the fact that among all alcohols studied, only 1-decanol
partially demixes with FA; however, this is accurately described by
PC-SAFT as well.

%) is 10/45/45. Orange represents experimental data,16,20 and green is the PC-SAFT prediction.

3.1.2 DFA and SFA,H2O of Artificial Model System
between 298 and 363 K
In a next step, the temperature dependency
of DFAexp values was predicted with PC-SAFT. The experimental data
used for that purpose were measured for mixtures that contained additional
catalyst in a concentration that was the same as in the real reaction
mixture.12 Nevertheless, the presence of
catalyst was neglected for the DFAPC-SAFT prediction. Further,
prediction of DFAPC-SAFT was in good agreement with the
experimental data by setting kij between water and FA equal to zero at 363 K. Figure 3 compares DFAexp and DFAPC-SAFT for the extraction solvents: 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol,
1-octanol, and 1-decanol. The absence of 1-butanol is due to the fact
that FA/water/1-butanol is a homogeneous mixture at 363 K. It can
be observed that DFAexp decreases over the length of the C-chain,
which is also predicted accurately with PC-SAFT. This means that accurate
predictions are possible with PC-SAFT that do not require binary parameters
except as those between water and extraction solvent. Consequently,
for all systems, the kij values between water and FA were set to zero at 363 K.

Figure 3 Distribution

acid in ternary water/FA/extraction solvent mixtures at 363 K under
atmospheric pressure for various extraction solvents: 1-pentanol,
1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol. Feed composition
(FA/water/solvent in wt %) is 20/40/40. Orange represents experimental
data acquired in this work, and green is the PC-SAFT prediction.

To account for temperature dependency, kij between FA and water was
assumed to decrease linearly
with decreasing temperature according to eq 15. This allowed a reasonably good agreement
between DFAPC-SAFT and DFAexp. Similarly,
also the kij value for
FA/1-decanol was found to be equal to zero at 363 K and to decrease
linearly with increasing temperature. Hence, the DFAPC-SAFT at 363 K is predicted with only the temperature-dependent kij between water and the extraction
solvents, whereas the prediction model is kept as simple as possible. Figure 4 illustrates DFAPC-SAFT and DFAexp and their dependence on temperature considering
various extraction alcohols. At temperatures above 298 K, the mixture
FA/water/1-butanol is homogeneous and LLE was not found with PC-SAFT
as well (no DFAPC-SAFT values above 298 K). The increase
of DFAexp with temperature is predicted also with PC-SAFT.

1-heptanol (green circle and green dash dotted line) and 1-decanol

3.1.3 Predicting the Extraction Using Data from
OxFA Process
In a final step within this work, DFA and SFA,H2O were
predicted with PC-SAFT at 363 K under atmospheric pressure for real
systems. That means these data originated from the OxFA process, where
the homogeneous HPA-5 catalyst converts several biogenic substrates
to FA in aqueous phase. The produced biogenic FA is removed in situ
from the reaction mixture using suitable organic extracting agents.
These data are available in Reichert et al.12 The data measured consequently stem from mixtures that contain biogenic
FA, water, extracting agent, possible side products or nonconverted
substrates, and the HPA-5 catalyst. In this work, DFA and SFA,H2O values
stemming from these complex real systems were predicted with PC-SAFT
assuming only FA, water, and extraction solvents present in the mixtures.
The predictions were based on the pure-component parameters and on
one binary parameter between water and the extraction solvent, as
presented in Tables 1 and 2. This rough modeling approach nevertheless
might yield a good estimation to select the most thermodynamically
promising solvent for FA extraction from aqueous reaction media.

In Figure 5, the comparison
of DFAPC-SAFT and DFAexp is illustrated, and in Figure 6, SFA,H2OPC-SAFT and SFA,H2Oexp are compared for various extraction
solvents. The alcohols 1-hexanol and 1-heptanol show the best DFAexp and SFA,H2Oexp values, and DFAPC-SAFT and SFA,H2OPC-SAFT are slightly overestimated, as
can be seen for DFAPC-SAFT in Figure 3. In contrast to the alcohols, the ethers
(ethyl n-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and di-n-butyl ether) cause smaller values for DFAexp and SFA,H2Oexp. This matches the predicted values for DFAPC-SAFT and SFA,H2OPC-SAFT, whereas DFAPC-SAFT is smaller than DFAexp and SFA,H2OPC-SAFT is
larger than SFA,H2Oexp. SFA,H2OPC-SAFT under the presence of the formates is higher than SFA,H2Oexp. For benzyl formate, DFAPC-SAFT and DFAexp are almost
identical, but heptyl formate shows a larger deviation of the latter
values. Although it is a complex task to predict DFA and SFA,H2O,
it can be seen that on the basis of the prediction of PC-SAFT it is
possible to select the most promising extraction solvents for detailed
investigation in lab experiments.

solvent mixture at 363 K under atmospheric pressure for various extraction
solvents: 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, ethyl n-butyl ether,
benzyl formate, heptyl formate, diisopropyl ether, and di-n-butyl ether. Feed composition (FA/water/solvent in wt
%) is 9/45/46. Orange represents experimental data,12 and green is the PC-SAFT prediction.

To sum up, there is huge potential for saving money by avoiding
costly lab experiments and predicting the selectivities of the extraction
solvent instead. It is important to see that in this work PC-SAFT
is used to get a very good estimation of the potentials of extraction
solvents. The aim is not to have the most accurate prediction, which
implies introducing more binary interaction parameters and fitting
them to experimental data, but to have at least a method in hand that
is able to reliably predict the qualitative behavior of different
extraction solvents and thus can be used as a solvent-screening tool
for FA extraction from aqueous reaction mixtures.

4 Conclusions
In this work, distribution coefficients
and selectivities of the
system FA/water with different extraction solvents were predicted
with PC-SAFT and compared to measured data from this work and from
the literature. The investigated extraction solvents were 1-butanol,
1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-decanol, ethyl n-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-butyl ether,
benzyl formate, and heptyl formate. The predictions were compared
to the data of artificial model systems at 298.15 K (system without
catalyst and side products), data of systems under temperature conditions
near real reaction conditions (up to 363.15 K), and data of systems
from real reaction broth at 363.15 K. All data were determined under
atmospheric pressure. The PC-SAFT model was used to predict the ternary
systems without any knowledge of the latter and with a minimum amount
of data required for binary subsystems. For all predictions, the pure-component
PC-SAFT parameters and the binary interaction parameters between water
and the extraction solvent were required. It was found that these kij parameters were required
between components, which form a miscibility gap. Applying this approach
allowed predicting the LLE and the derived properties distribution
coefficient and selectivity, which are very sensitive properties.
This highlights the advantage of using physical-based models over
correlations as it means a significant reduction of required experimental
data and further explains the occurrence of unexpected behavior of
distribution coefficient and selectivity with respect to the chain
length of the extraction solvent.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Experimental Determination of Extraction Parameters
All chemicals were obtained commercially and used without further
purification. The HPA-5 catalyst H8[PV5Mo7O40]·12H2O was synthesized according
to the literature.4,34 The characterization via inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) resulted in
a P/V/Mo ratio of 1/4.93/7.05. ICP-OES measurements were conducted
on a PerkinElmer Plasma 400 instrument, and NMR spectra were recorded
on a Jeol ECX-400 MHz spectrometer. Gaseous sample analyses were performed
using a Varian GC 450 equipped with a 2 m × 0.75 mm ID ShinCarbon
ST column.

5.2 Catalytic Oxidation Reactions
(Monophasic
OxFA Process)
The oxidation reactions were carried out in
a 600 mL Hastelloy C276 autoclave equipped with a gas entrainment
impeller. Water (100 g), 0.5 mmol (0.91 g) HPA-5, and 10 mmol (1.80
g) glucose were charged into the vessel. The system was purged three
times with oxygen, the stirrer was set to 300 rpm, and heating was
started. When the desired temperature of 363 K was reached, the oxygen
pressure was increased to 20 bar and the stirrer was set to 1000 rpm.

5.3 Ex Situ Extraction
After oxidizing
a solution containing 1.80 g of glucose, 0.91 g of HPA-5, and 100.0
g of H2O for 6 h at 363 K under 20 bar oxygen pressure,
FA formation was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The
extraction solvent (100.0 g) was preheated to 363 K and then added
to the reaction mixture, resulting in a liquid–liquid biphasic
mixture that was stirred for 1 h at 363 K under ambient pressure.
The biphasic solution was separated, and a sample of each phase was
taken and analyzed by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine
the FA concentration.

5.4 Oxidation Experiments with
in Situ Extraction
(Biphasic OxFA Process)
For the oxidation experiments with
in situ extraction, substrate (1.80 g glucose), 0.91 g of HPA-5 catalyst,
100.0 g of H2O, and 100.0 g of extracting agent were charged
into the reactor. The system was purged three times with oxygen and
then the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature with stirring
at 300 rpm. When reaching 363 K, oxygen pressure and stirrer speed
were set to the desired values. After the experiments, both liquid
phases were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine
their FA content.
