Introduction
Resistance switching
memory devices have gained increasing attention
as a promising candidate for the next generation of nonvolatile memories
owing to their stable performance, high storage density, low power
consumption, and good scaling capability.1−5

So far, various kinds of materials such as
inorganic materials,
inorganic/organic hybrid materials, organic small-molecule compounds
and polymers have already been demonstrated to exhibit switchable
resistance performance.6−9 Extensive studies on the applications of memory devices based on
organic small-molecule and polymeric materials have been carried out
because of the advantages such as low cost, three-dimensional stacking
capability for high-density data storage, and the possibility of modulating
their properties through the molecular design and chemical synthesis.10−12 However, the relatively low thermostability and chemical resistances
of organic materials make them susceptible to damage and difficult
to show good data-storage performance in harsh environment such as
high temperature and solution processing.13 In order to improve the device switching performance and enhance
the applicability, large numbers of functional materials, including
conjugated polymers, vinyl polymers with specific pendant groups,
polymer/organic molecule blends, polymer/metal complexes, and so forth
have been tested, and they achieved good results.

Metal polyphthalocyanines
(PPcs), known for many unique properties
such as great environmental stability and good conductivity, have
attracted attention of researchers.14−17 However, the applications of
PPcs have been hindered by the poor processability because of the
insolubility in any organic solvent, and high melting/boiling point
makes them difficult to be fabricated into thin film devices.18 Most reported synthetic methods for PPcs are
based on the solid-phase reaction of metal salts with pyromellitic
dianhydride, but the bulk PPcs synthesized generally have low polymerization
degree and poor structural uniformity.19−21 In order to achieve
more applications, it is necessary to prepare two-dimensional (2D)
PPcs in the form of thin films on arbitrary substrates. In a previous
work, the researchers showed that through a surface reaction between
1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) molecules and Mn atoms on Ag(111),
a 2D phthalocyanine polymer can be obtained.22 However, the experimental steps were complicated (ultrahigh vacuum
conditions and atomically clean surfaces were needed) and only nanoscale
domains were obtained, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements
for the preparation of electronic devices. At present, chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) has emerged as a scalable and controllable way to
prepare 2D materials in large area, such as graphene, transition-metal
dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, and so forth.23−25 In comparison with evaporation and solution processing, the CVD
method is beneficial for large-scale fabrication, and the obtained
materials are easier to transfer onto the required substrate for device
fabrication.

In this communication, we report the CVD growth
and characterization
of copper PPc (CuPPc) thin films and the fabrication and performance
of nonvolatile memory devices based on it. The obtained CuPPc films
with high polymerization degree and crystallinity were confirmed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and UV–vis studies. Also, the devices show obvious nonvolatile
rewritable memory performance, with a large ON/OFF current ratio of
103 and a retention time of 1.2 × 103 s.

Results
and Discussion
The CuPPc thin film was synthesized by CVD
setup, following the
protocol as reported in the literature.26 A schematic illustration of the synthetic process and experimental
setup are shown in Figure 1a,b. The reaction was carried out in a two-zone oven. TCNB
was evaporated in the first zone at 110 °C and deposited onto
the electrochemically polished Cu foil that was placed in the second
zone.

of the CVD system.

The obtained CuPPc thin
films were transferred to a 300 nm SiO2/Si substrate with
a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-assisted
transfer process.27 Under the optical microscope,
in most areas, the color of the film is uniform, which indicates that
the film thickness has high uniformity (Figure 2a). Also, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) further confirms the uniform distribution of elements in the
film (Figure S1). The thickness and surface
roughness of the CuPPc thin films were characterized by an atomic
force microscope (AFM). As shown in Figure 2b, the thin films have a thickness of 106
± 6 nm. AFM characterization reveals a total surface roughness
of 25.8 ± 0.8 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study
shows that the CuPPc thin films have a polycrystalline structure with
the characteristic crystallite size of at least several tens of nanometers
(Figure 2c and inset).
The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns exhibits a
four-fold symmetry which agrees well with that expected from the chemical
structure of CuPPc. The lattice spacing is 0.260 ± 0.003 nm.
Under a polarized microscope, the color of the CuPPc film changed
simultaneously from bright to dark when rotating the substrate, which
is caused by the crystallinity of the film (Figure S2). XPS was used to further characterize the chemical composition
of the films and confirmed the successful formation of CuPPc. As shown
in Figure 2d, the XPS
spectrum of the Cu 2p core level has two obvious peaks at 935.4 and
955.3 eV, respectively, which correspond to the electron state of
Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, demonstrating the existence
of Cu(II).28,29 The Cu(II) is located at the
ligand environment of the nitrogen-enriched structure of the phthalocyanine
ring. The N 1s spectrum of CuPPc can be separated into two components,
the lower binding energy component centered at 398.7 eV can be attributed
to pyridinic-N and the one at 399.8 eV is from pyrrolic-N, which clearly
confirms the presence of Cu–N4 moieties in the CuPPc
films (Figure 2e).22 The C 1s spectra can be fitted with bands at
284.6, 285.8, and 288.4 eV, which are attributed to aromatic C–C
bonds, N–C=N and C=O, respectively (Figure S3a).30 The
UV–vis absorption spectra of CuPPc are shown in Figure 2f. A strong absorption peak
around 200 nm is observed, and there is a certain degree of absorption
after the wavelength greater than 800 nm reaches the infrared region.
The results show that the absorption of the CuPPc films continues
far beyond the monomeric CuPc absorption threshold (700 nm), confirming
the extended π-conjugation of CuPPc. Another important observation
is the absence of the 740 nm absorption band, which is associated
with monomeric CuPc and oligomers with low polymerization degree.31 The 700 nm band is attributed to the lowest
energy electronic transition of the CuPc, while in CuPPc, high conjugation
leads to merging of molecular orbitals into valence bands and conduction
bands, and the small band gap results in absorption extended to the
infrared region. The absence of 740 nm band for the polymer provides
extra evidence of a high polymerization degree.

The memory device with a sandwich
structure of Au/CuPPc/indium
tin oxide (ITO) was fabricated and the performance was investigated
under ambient conditions. The electrode material Au with high work
function was used as the top electrode instead of the commonly used
Al, which is sensitive to oxidation, contributing to a better long-term
stability of the device. As shown in Figure 3a, the CuPPc thin film-based memory device
exhibits a nonvolatile rewritable memory performance, with a turn-on
voltage of +1.34 V and an ON/OFF current ratio of about 103. When the voltage swept positively from 0 to +8 V, current through
the device rapidly changed from 10–5 to 10–3 A at the turn-on voltage of +1.34 V (sweep 1), implying that the
device was switched from the OFF state to the ON state. This switch-on
process is also called as the writing process. The ON state could
be kept unchanged during the second sweep (sweep 2, from +8 V back
to 0 V) and even after cutting off the electricity supply, demonstrating
that the device possesses a nonvolatile memory characteristic. When
the negative voltage was applied to the device (sweep 3), the device
still remained in the ON state until reaching the turn-off voltage
of −0.79 V, where the device current decreased abruptly from
10–3 to 10–6 A. This indicates
that the device has returned to the OFF state with low conductivity.
This process corresponds to the erasing process. A relatively high
ON/OFF current ratio of about 103 was obtained. The memory I–V loops are reproducible and of
16 consecutive cycles are shown in Figure S4 without clear degradation of the ON and OFF states, which was also
reflected from the changes of the resistance values in the high resistance
state (HRS)/low resistance state (LRS). To explore the uniformity
of the switching of the as-prepared device, I–V curves of 200 devices were measured. The device-to-device
distributions of the HRS resistance and LRS resistance range from
8.2 × 106 to 6.2 × 104 Ω and
1.3 × 103 to 4.7 × 101 Ω (read
at −0.1 V), respectively, are shown in Figure 3b. To evaluate the persistence of the ON/OFF
states of the Au/CuPPc/ITO devices, the retention characteristic was
measured under −0.1 V read voltage at room temperature, as
shown in Figure 3c.
The resistance of both the states showed no obvious change for 1.2
× 103 s, indicating that our devices have a relatively
good stability.

current of 10 mA is used to prevent the breakdown of the device in

where the results are obtained under −0.1 V read voltage from
200 devices. (c) Retention characteristics of both the resistance
states under a continuous −0.1 V readout voltage at room temperature.

Because the Au electrode is passive,
the electrochemical metallization
memory mechanism can be ruled out. In order to explore the conduction
mechanism of resistive switching, the typical I–V curve of the devices was plotted using a double-logarithmic
scale, as shown in Figure 4a. The I–V characteristic
of the LRS showed a linear plot with a slope of 1, indicating the
Ohmic behavior. However, the I–V characteristic of the HRS was more complicated and could be divided
into two regions. In the low voltage range from 0 to 0.56 V, the lg I–lg V characteristic showed a linear
relation, corresponding to Ohmic behavior, whereas in the high voltage
region of the HRS (0.56 V to Vset), the
lg I–lg V curve showed a
nonlinear relation, suggesting a different conducting mechanism. Further
analysis indicated a linear relation between ln(I) and V1/2, as shown in Figure 4b, suggesting that Schottky
emission is the dominant conduction mechanism in the high voltage
region of the HRS.32,33

scale. (b) Typical ln(I) vs V1/2 plot for the high voltage region of the HRS.

Figure 5a shows
the cross section high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Au/CuPPc/ITO
device in the ON state. One conductive filament (CF) (marked with
red rectangle) is observed in the HRTEM image, as shown in Figure 5a,b. The elemental
mapping images of In, Cu, and Au are shown in Figure 5c, indicating that the CF is composed of
Cu elements. It can be concluded that the CF is formed at the LRS
for the device, which is in agreement with that deduced from the I–V fitting. Therefore, we suppose
that in the SET process, the Cu2+ ions located at the phthalocyanine
ring were reduced to Cu atoms at the CuPPc/ITO interface. The process
would continue until the entire filament is formed. When a negative
voltage was applied to the top electrode in the RESET process, the
Cu atoms were oxidized into Cu2+ ions, and the filament
was ruptured.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized CuPPc thin films
through a CVD
method and studied their composition and structure via TEM, XPS, and
UV–vis, which confirms the successful formation of CuPPc with
high polymerization degree and crystallinity. This film was used as
the active layer for the memory device with sandwich structure Au/CuPPc/ITO,
and the devices showed nonvolatile rewritable memory performance,
with a large ON/OFF current ratio of 1 × 103 and a
retention time of 1.2 × 103 s. Both the I–V analysis and HRTEM and EDX mapping of
the cross section of a device in the ON state suggest the formation
of conductive metal filaments.

Experimental Section
CVD Growth of CuPPc Films
CVD growth of CuPPc was carried
out in a quartz tube reactor, placed in a two-zone oven. TCNB was
grounded and pressed into tablets. Then, it was evaporated in the
first zone at 110 °C with a flow of Ar (15 sccm), while a Cu
foil was placed in the second one. Reaction temperature was 350 °C
and the reaction time was 2.5 h. The temperatures in the two zones
were controlled by thermocouples. Before the growth reaction, the
Cu foil was annealed at 1050 °C in the atmosphere of Ar (200
sccm)/H2 (50 sccm) to remove organics and oxides on the
surface. After reaching the reaction time, the sample was cooled to
room temperature and then the Ar flow was shut off.

Memory Device
Fabrication and Measurements
The memory
device with sandwich structure ITO/CuPPc/Au was fabricated. The ITO
substrate (10 mm × 10 mm) was precleaned sequentially with acetone,
isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath
for 12 min. The PMMA/CuPPc films were transferred onto the ITO substrate,
followed by the removal of PMMA in acetone overnight. The thickness
of the active layer was about 106 nm. Finally, the Au top electrode
(50 nm in thickness) was deposited onto the polymer film by E-beam
evaporation using a shadow mask under ultrahigh vacuum. The performance
of the device was characterized with a Keithley 4200 semiconductor
parameter analyzer. All measurements were carried out at room temperature
under ambient conditions.
