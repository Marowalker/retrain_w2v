Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPNs) have been considered
as
one of the most studied nanomaterials for subsurface applications,
including in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), due to their unique physicochemical
properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of
surface functionalization on the ability of the nanoparticles to improve
secondary and tertiary oil recoveries remains unclear. Therefore,
investigations on the application of bare and surface-functionalized
SPNs in EOR using a sand pack were carried out in this study. Here,
the as-prepared SPNs were functionalized using oleic acid (OA) and
polyacrylamide (PAM) to obtain several types of nanostructure architectures
such as OA-SPN, core–shell SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM. Based on the
result, it is found that both the viscosity and mobility of the nanofluids
were significantly affected by not only the concentration of the nanoparticles
but also the type and architecture of the surface modifier, which
dictated particle hydrophilicity. According to the sand pack tests,
the nanofluid containing SPN-PAM was able to recover as much as 19.28%
of additional oil in a relatively low concentration (0.9% w/v). The
high oil recovery enhancement was presumably due to the ability of
suspended SPN-PAM to act as a mobility control and wettability alteration
agent and facilitate the formation of a Pickering emulsion and disjoining
pressure.

Introduction
The rapid increment in global population
has led to a growing need
for petroleum products, not only as fuels but also as an essential
raw material for many industrial processes. Although recent drops
in oil price due to the high supply of crude oil have hampered the
exploration of new oil reserves, the application of enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) methods is still desired to improve the production of oil from
matured fields.1−3 In a typical matured oil field, more than 50% of
original oil in place (OOIP) is still unrecovered, and EOR via chemical
injections is among the most applied methods to harvest the remaining
oil.4,5 Traditionally, various types of chemical
injections can be used to recover oil from matured fields, i.e., polymers,
surfactants, alkalis, or their binary/ternary mixtures.6−8 In general, the objective of these chemical injections is primarily
to reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water. By
having an ultralow IFT, the residual oil trapped in the porous media
can easily be mobilized due to the generation of moving displacement
front.9 Furthermore, chemical injection
is also carried out to alter the wettability of the reservoir rock
surface from oil-wet to water-wet. Mohammed and Babadagli reported
that this alteration of rock properties could significantly reduce
or even eliminate the capillary forces that retain oil in porous media
and enables them to be recovered during the EOR process easily.10 However, the utilization of certain types of
surfactants and polymers was sometimes unable to effectively attain
the required ultralow IFT and sufficient wettability alteration due
to extreme reservoir conditions. Besides, most of the currently used
surfactants and polymers are made of environmentally unfriendly substances,
which require additional cost for postproduction treatment.

Injection of nanoparticle suspension, as opposed to surfactants
and polymers, has attracted vast attention as it offers many benefits,
such as the ability to significantly improve secondary and tertiary
oil recoveries, low cost, excellent stability at extreme reservoir
conditions, and environmental friendliness.11 Many works have reported that various types of inorganic nanoparticles
such as SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, and NiO have successfully been applied in EOR.12−16 Besides, nanoparticle injection is also preferred due to its intrinsic
physicochemical properties, depending on the type of the nanoparticles,
such as large specific surface area, excellent thermal and electrical
conductivities, and the ability to penetrate into remote regions inside
the porous media. It is reported that the superiority of these nanoparticles
in EOR could be associated with its ability to significantly reduce
the IFT and to efficiently alter the wettability of porous media.17,18 Suleimanov and co-workers reported that the drastic reduction of
IFT due to the presence of metal nanoparticles (size: ∼70–150
nm) could result in alteration of the rheological behavior of the
fluid from a Newtonian to non-Newtonian state.19 Recently, a new additional mechanism for the improvement
of oil recovery using a nanoparticle-based EOR process has also been
reported elsewhere.20,21 Using experimental and theoretical
approaches, it is reported that the injection of nanoparticles causes
the formation of a two-dimensional layered structure in the space
between the oily soil and rock surface, creating a disjoining pressure
between them. This pressure becomes more significant as more nanoparticles
are injected during EOR and move forward to occupy the rock surface
and ultimately detach the oily sands from it. Zhang and co-workers
reported that the magnitude of this pressure is significantly affected
by the type, size, charge, polydispersity, and volume fraction of
the nanoparticles.21

Very recently,
the potential of superparamagnetic nanoparticles
(SPNs) for subsurface applications has substantially increased due
to their unique physicochemical properties. Among various types of
SPNs, magnetite (Fe3O4) has been considered
as one of the most studied due to its high chemical stability, low
cost, nontoxicity, and ease of fabrication in a controlled fashion.11 Similar to their applications in MRI, SPNs could
potentially be employed for oil field magnetic-field-based reservoir
imaging via magnetomotive acoustic imaging and cross-well electromagnetic
tomography.22,23 Furthermore, the high magnetic
susceptibility also enables them to be quickly recovered and reused
for further EOR injections. Nevertheless, the harsh conditions in
the oil reservoirs can sometimes hinder the mobility and distribution
of the nanoparticles inside porous media. It is reported that high
reservoir salinity (up to >1 M of monovalent and divalent salts)
and
high temperatures (up to more than 150 °C) could induce the agglomeration
and aggregation of the nanoparticles.24 Besides, the mobility of certain types of nanoparticles with high
surface energy such as metal oxides in porous media could also be
disturbed by their strong attachment to the surface of minerals.25,26

Tremendous efforts have been carried out to avoid the potential
aggregation of nanoparticles and their attachment to the surface of
minerals during the subsurface injection. One of the simplest potential
ways is via surface functionalization. Recently, Khalil and co-workers
highlighted that several types of organic acids and polymers could
be used as surface modifiers for different types of nanoparticles
in oil and gas applications.11 In general,
depending on the nature of the nanoparticles, these surface modifiers
can be attached via the formation of coordination interaction due
to the presence of functional groups such as thiols, carboxylic acids,
phosphonic acid, amines, silanes, and alcohols.27−30 Nevertheless, the investigation
of the surface functionalization of SPNs and the ability of surface
modifiers to improve their colloidal stability at extreme subsurface
conditions have received little attention. Therefore, the study on
the influence of the surface functionalization of SPNs on their ability
to improve secondary and tertiary oil recoveries in EOR was carried
out. Here, oleic acid (OA) and polyacrylamide (PAM) were used as surface
modifiers to fabricate three different types of surface-functionalized
SPN composites with various architectures, i.e., OA-SPN, core–shell
SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM, characterized using various methods. In addition,
the ability of these surface modification techniques to improve the
colloidal stability of SPNs was also evaluated by measuring the ζ-potential
of each sample at various concentration of NaCl. Furthermore, the
performance of the as-prepared surface-functionalized SPN composites
in enhancing oil recovery during EOR was also assessed using a home-made
sand pack.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of Bare and Surface-Functionalized
SPNs
In nanofluid flooding, surface properties of the injected
nanoparticles play a vital role in improving the recovery of oil.11 Here, oleic acid (OA) and polyacrylamide (PAM)
were utilized as modifiers to fabricate surface-modified SPNs with
different architectures. Figure 1a shows the schematic illustration of the surface-modified
SPN used for EOR in this study. Furthermore, several investigations
were also carried out to study the physicochemical properties of the
as-prepared nanostructures. Figure 1b presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the samples. Based on the result, it is apparent that all of the samples
could be unambiguously ascribed as magnetite (Fe3O4). This is true since the obtained Bragg’s peaks were
in a good agreement with characteristic peaks of the inverse cubic
spinel phase of Fe3O4 in database (JCPDS card
no. 85-1436) and other reports.2,22,29,31 Results also suggest that the
surface modification using OA and PAM has no effect on the crystal
structure of the SPN.

(b) XRD patterns, (c) Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, (d)
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms, and (e) magnetization
curves of the as-prepared nanostructures.

FTIR spectroscopy was used further to confirm the
surface functionalization
of SPN using OA and PAM. The obtained FTIR spectra could be used not
only to confirm the presence of surface modifiers but also to study
the interaction between the modifiers and the surface of SPN. Figure 1c shows the FTIR
spectra of SPN before and after surface modification. According to
the result, it was evident that all of the as-prepared nanostructures
show sharp absorption peaks in the range of 520–610 cm–1 known for the iron oxide Fe–O stretching backbone
vibrations at tetrahedral sites.32 Nevertheless,
it is also noticed that the peak was shifted to shorter wavenumbers
as the SPN was surface functionalized. FTIR spectra revealed that
the Fe–O peak for bare SPN was observed at 543.88 cm–1. Meanwhile, the Fe–O peaks for OA-SPN, SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM
were found at 534.16, 524.45, and 514.73 cm–1, respectively.
This suggests that the interaction between OA or PAM and SPN could
result in the weakening of the Fe–O bond, which is possibly
due to chemical bonding. For OA-SPN, this bonding formation was also
proven by the absence of the C=O stretch peak of OA for the
carboxyl group at 1710 cm–1, which was replaced
by the appearance of two new peaks for the symmetric (νs) and asymmetric (νas) peaks of COO– at 1545.26 and 1688.76 cm–1, respectively.33 In addition, the presence of OA was also confirmed
by the presence of two CH3 stretching peaks at 2913 and
2837 cm–1. For the case core–shell SPN@PAM
and SPN-PAM, the presence of PAM was proven by the appearance of strong
peaks at 1640.65 and 1612.99 cm–1, which can be
attributed to amidic C=O stretching vibration and N–H
bending vibration, respectively.34 Additionally,
the broad peak at 3000–3500 cm–1 due to the
stretching vibration of N–H groups also indicated the presence
of PAM.

Surface functionalization of SPN using OA and PAM was
also proven
by TGA analysis. In Figure 1d, TGA thermograms revealed that a weight loss was observed
in the surface-functionalized SPN samples due to the decomposition
of modifiers at high temperature. However, no significant weight loss
was found in the corresponding pristine SPN. According to the result,
the organic coating (OA) was decomposed at a reasonably low temperature
(below 300 °C), whereas the polymeric modifiers (PAMs) started
to decompose at a higher temperature (>400 °C). Furthermore,
results from VSM analyses also suggested that surface functionalization
with OA and PAM did not significantly alter the magnetic properties
of the nanoparticles (Figure 1e). Based on the result, it is clear that all samples exhibited
a superparamagnetic behavior. This is proven by the shape of symmetrical
sigmoidal magnetization with the lack of a hysteresis loop in the
magnetization curves.35

Additional
investigation using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was also conducted to study further the morphology of the as-prepared
nanostructures. Figure 2 shows the micrographic images of the samples obtained from TEM and
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses as well as their particle size
distributions. According to the result, it is apparent that the co-precipitation
method was successfully used to fabricate SPNs with a polyhedral shape
(Figure 2a). It is
also revealed that surface modification has very small influence on
the morphology of the nanostructures (Figure 2b–d). Further analyses using HRTEM
and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses have also provided
additional insights into the crystal structure of the nanoparticles.
In Figure 2e–h,
it is obvious that all of the as-prepared nanostructures were well-faceted
and exhibited the unique lattice fringes at 0.29 and 0.25 nm for magnetite
(220) and (311) crystal planes, respectively. This result was also
further supported by the corresponding SAED analyses (the inset).
Besides, the result from particle size distribution analyses has demonstrated
that the as-prepared nanoparticles had a fairly uniform particle size
distribution (Figure 2i-l). Based on the estimation, the average size of the pristine SPN
particles was around 12.74 ± 3.59 nm. Meanwhile, the corresponding
OA-SPN, core–shell SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM had the average particle
sizes of 10.74 ± 2.98, 15.38 ± 6.56, and 15.34 ± 7.57
nm, respectively.

(inset:
SAED analyses), and (i)–(l) particles size distributions of
SPN, OA-SPN, SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM, respectively.

Colloidal Stability of Bare and Surface-Functionalized SPNs
To further investigate the influence of surface modification on
the colloidal stability of the nanoparticles, both bare and surface-functionalized
SPN nanoparticle samples were dispersed in water, resulting in dark-black
suspensions. Based on the result in Figure 3a, it is apparent that all of the as-prepared
nanostructures could be efficiently dispersed in water and exhibited
no sign of severe particle agglomeration. It is also found that no
particle sedimentation was observed even after seven days (Figure 3b). This high colloidal
stability is desirable in many applications since it is essential
to preserve the high surface area of the nanoparticles. Unlike ferromagnetic
nanoparticles, which tend to lose their colloidal stability caused
by magnetic dipole–dipole interaction, superparamagnetism in
SPNs allows the particles to avoid rapid agglomeration due to their
zero coercivity (Hc) in the absence of
an external magnetic field. This superparamagnetic state is mainly
obtained when the size of particles is smaller than the zero-coercivity
diameter (Dp).11 At this stage, the presence of single domain magnetism causes all
of the magnetic spin in the same direction.36 Nevertheless, the nanoparticles can show an excellent magnetic response
when subjected to an external magnetic field (Figure 3e). As shown in Figure 3c, both bare and surface-functionalized SPNs
could easily be separated from the suspension using a permanent external
magnet.

after (a) 10 min and (b) 7 days; (c) separation of the nanostructures
using a permanent magnet; and (d) ζ-potential (ζ) of the
nanostructures at different concentrations of NaCl.

In addition, further investigations were also carried
out to study
the influence of surface modification on the colloidal stability of
the nanostructures in artificial brine. Here, the colloidal stability
of the samples was studied by measuring the ζ-potential of the
nanostructures at various concentrations of NaCl. In general, a stable
colloidal system can be indicated by its high absolute value of ζ.
Typically, nanoparticles with ζ value higher than +25 mV or
lower than −25 mV have a high degree of colloidal stability.37,38 Meanwhile, nanoparticles with low value of ζ are more likely
to aggregate due to van der Waals interaction. Figure 3d shows the result from the measurement of
ζ for both bare and surface-modified SPNs.

Based on the
result, even though no specific correlation between
ζ and concentration was observed, it is apparent that surface-functionalized
SPNs had substantially larger ζ value than bare SPNs. Results
showed that the unmodified SPNs tend to aggregate in artificial brine
since the absolute ζ values were found to be less than 20 mV
(Figure 3d). This colloidal
instability is believed primarily due to the strong Van der Waals
interaction as a result of free hydroxyl groups in the crystal edge
of the bare SPN surface. Nevertheless, a significant increase in electrostatic
stabilization was obtained when SPN was functionalized with OA and
PAM. According to the result, the increment in colloidal stability
can be indicated by the large value of the negative ζ obtained
for the surface-functionalized SPN, i.e., 30.6, −28.3, and
−31.9 mV for OA-SPN, core–shell SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM,
respectively. Although no adequate models to accurately estimate such
effect and its magnitude exist, it is believed that the presence of
surface modifiers is responsible for increasing the electrical double
layer repulsion and ultimately avoiding aggregation and sedimentation.
The presence of a long-chain hydrocarbon tail of OA and amine residues
in the PAM backbone is presumed to be one of the main factors responsible
for the increment of the colloidal stability of surface-functionalized
SPNs. A similar phenomenon was also reported elsewhere when SPN was
coated with SiO2.39 It is also
argued that polymeric steric stabilization could also contribute to
the stabilization of core–shell SPN@PAM and SPN-PAM colloidal
systems.40

Mobility Ratio of Nanofluids
Typically, an excellent
displacing fluid for EOR should have a higher viscosity value than
oil. Figure 4a shows
the viscosity of the colloidal suspension of the as-prepared nanostructures
at various concentrations. Based on the result, it is apparent that
the viscosity of the nanofluid increases with its loading concentration.
This is true for both bare and surface-functionalized SPNs. In most
cases, a nanofluid behaves as a Newtonian fluid and increasing the
concentration of disperse particles gives rise to the increment in
viscosity. However, many classical analytical models, such as Einstein
(1906), Brinkman (1952), or Batchelor (1977) models, failed to accurately
estimate the effect of concentration on the viscosity when the size
of the solute particles is in the range of nanoscale.41−43 Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to understand the relationship
between the loading concentration of nanoparticles and the viscosity.44,45

Figure 4 (a)
Viscosity and (b) mobility ratio of the colloidal suspensions
of the as-prepared nanostructures at various loading concentrations.

In general, most of the currently used viscosity
models are based
on the Brownian motion of the nanoparticles.46,47 Udawattha and co-workers suggested that the Brownian motion occurs
when nanoparticles are suspended in the base fluid as the result of
the relative viscosity of the base fluid and the nanoparticles.48 It is also reported that the magnitude of this
motion is highly affected not only by temperature but also by the
loading concentration of the nanoparticles. At low concentration,
particle aggregation due to van der Waals attraction forces is minimum,
making the suspended nanoparticles experience less resistance to flow.
This will lead to a lower viscosity value. However, when the mass
fraction of the nanoparticles is increased, the particles are inclined
to aggregate due to the reduction of the average distance between
them. As a result, the van der Waals interaction becomes more prominent,
causing an increase in shear stress within the nanofluid and making
it harder to flow (Figure 4a).

Interestingly, it is also noticed that the type
and architecture
of the surface modifiers have a different effect on the viscosity
of the resulting nanofluids. At low loading concentration (0.1% w/v),
surface modification caused the viscosity of nanofluids to increase,
regardless of the type and architecture of the modifiers. However,
the viscosity seemed to behave differently when more nanoparticles
were suspended in the base fluid (loading concentrations of 0.5 and
0.9%). As shown in Figure 4a, the viscosity values of OA-SPN and core–shell SPM@PAM
were found to be lower than that of the colloidal solution of bare
SPN. On the other hand, SPN-PAM was found to render a more viscous
nanofluid. It is assumed that such a phenomenon occurred mainly due
to different hydrophilicities of the nanoparticles. According to Zhang
and Han, hydrophilic nanoparticles tend to exhibit higher viscosity
than hydrophilic–lipophilic nanoparticles.49 It is believed that water molecules can easily be absorbed
and form a water layer around the nanoparticles, causing an increase
in their average equivalent radius. This can cause the formation of
high interfacial resistance, which can hamper the mobility of nanoparticles
in the base fluid and ultimately increase the overall viscosity value.
Meanwhile, less hydrophilic nanoparticles (OA-SPN and SPM-PAM) tend
to exhibit better colloidal stability in aqueous and brine suspensions
(Figure 3d). Therefore,
the nanoparticles experience lesser van der Waals interaction between
them and smaller restriction to flow.

Recently, it has been
reported that the mobility of the nanofluid
in porous media (λd) has also known to be one of the major factors
in enhancing oil recovery.11,21 This value is highly
dependent on the viscosity of the nanofluids. Furthermore, it is also
believed that the ratio between the mobility of the nanofluid and
oil, commonly referred to as mobility ratio (M),
should also be made as low as possible to ensure the optimum sweep
efficiency of the displaced oil. In general, M <
1 is required to obtain optimum secondary and tertiary oil recoveries
during EOR.50Figure 4b presents the value of M for the nanofluids at various concentrations. Based on the result,
it is apparent that the value of M decreases with
nanoparticle loading concentration. This is true since, at high concentration,
the nanoparticles tend to have more prominent van der Waals interaction,
causing the fluid to have a higher viscosity value. Additionally,
results also demonstrated that the mobility of the nanofluid was significantly
affected by the hydrophilicity of the nanoparticles due to the presence
of a surface modifier and its architecture. As shown in Figure 4b, at high loading concentration,
hydrophilic SPN and SPN-PAM nanofluids exhibited a significantly lower M value than the hydrophilic–lipophilic OA-SPN and
SPN@PAM due to their high viscosity values. In addition, the presence
of a large PAM polymeric chain in SPN-PAM might also contribute to
the further increment of its viscosity and thus reduce the mobility
of the nanofluid in porous media.

Nanofluid Flooding
To further investigate the application
of both bare and surface-functionalized SPNs in EOR, nanofluids with
three different nanoparticle loading concentrations were prepared
for sand pack tests. Figure 5 presents the oil recovery performance of nanofluids made
from the as-prepared nanostructures at various concentrations. As
shown, it is clear that the majority of the oil production was obtained
during the initial primary water flooding. During this initial water
flooding injection, water is believed to be moving rather uniformly
throughout porous media and tends to be imbibed in small- and medium-sized
pores and displaces oil to larger pores.51,52 As a result, the remaining oil is trapped and immobile. However,
when the nanofluid was injected, the suspended nanoparticles could
interact with the trapped oil droplets and mobilize them for secondary
recovery. Finally, almost no further significant oil production was
observed when additional chasing brine was injected since all of the
remaining oil was already mobilized by the nanofluid. Table 1 shows the summarization of
sand pack test results.

Over the past several years, tremendous efforts have
been made
to understand the mechanism of the efficient enhancement of the oil
recovery during EOR by nanofluids.11 One
of the reasons was their excellent ability in changing the rock wettability
from oil-wet to water-wet. This wettability alteration ability is
believed primarily due to high surface energy of nanoparticles, which
enables them to be strongly adsorbed on the rock surface and change
its wettability.53 In other reports, the
enhancement in oil recovery due to nanofluid flooding is often associated
with the ability of nanoparticles to significantly reduce the interfacial
tension (IFT) between the oil and water.21 Furthermore, nanoparticles can also facilitate the generation of
a Pickering emulsion, which unlike classical emulsions formed in the
presence of surfactants tends to have greater stability against coalescence
at reservoir conditions.54−56 Additionally, the formation of
structural disjoining pressure between crude oil–brine–rock
during the injection of nanofluids has been considered as one of the
most dominant mechanisms in oil displacement.57 According to the literature, this disjoining pressure can be formed
at the space between oil droplets and the rock surface as the result
of formation of a wedgelike nanoparticle film at the wetting wedge.58 Zhang and co-workers reported that this disjoining
pressure is greater at the wedge tip and its magnitude is significantly
affected by the nanoparticle size, charge, volume fraction, and surface
properties.21

Further investigation
of the result from sand pack tests also reveals
that the ability of the nanofluid to recover oil was found to increase
with nanoparticle loading concentration. A similar observation was
also reported elsewhere.59,60 Such an increment was
anticipated since the mobility of the nanofluid with larger content
of nanoparticles was relatively smaller than the mobility of the oil.
Hence, this would result in better oil displacement efficiency. In
addition, the greater amount of loading concentration also contributed
to the increment of disjoining pressure in the wetting wedge between
oil droplets and the rock surface. Moreover, results also demonstrated
that the largest oil recovery was obtained when the nanofluid containing
SPN-PAM was injected into the sand pack. Based on the result, an additional
19.28% of oil could be extracted during secondary recovery (Table 1). This is consistent
with the results obtained from both viscosity and mobility ratio measurements,
where SPN-PAM had the highest viscosity value and the lowest mobility
ratio (Figure 4).

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that such a phenomenon is absent
when the SPN was modified with OA. It is observed that the secondary
oil recovery was rather constant even though the amount of OA-SPN
was increased to 0.9% w/v. This might be due to the lipophilicity
of the surface of the nanoparticles, which originated from the presence
of the long hydrocarbon tail of OA. It is suspected that, when in
contact with oil, some part of the suspended OA-SPN particles might
be transferred from the aqueous phase to the oil phase. As a result,
the ability of the nanoparticles to form the disjoining pressure and
mobility control would be lower than expected. In general, the schematic
illustration of the mechanism for the oil displacement by the nanofluid
is depicted in Figure 6.

oil recoveries during nanofluid flooding injection.

Conclusions
Three types of surface-functionalized superparamagnetic
nanoparticles
(SPNs), i.e., OA-SPN, core–shell SPN@PAM, and SPN-PAM, were
successfully prepared, and their abilities to improve oil recovery
were compared with that of bare SPN using a sand pack. According to
the result, it is revealed that the viscosity value of all nanofluid
types increased with the loading concentration of suspended nanoparticles
due to the strong van der Waals interaction between each particle.
Based on the estimation of the mobility ratio between the nanofluid
and oil, it is also found that higher nanoparticle loading concentration
was desired to obtain smaller fluid mobility, which is essential for
EOR applications. However, it is also observed that both the viscosity
and mobility of the nanofluid could also significantly be affected
by nanoparticle hydrophilicity, especially at high concentration (0.5–0.9%
w/v). Among the as-prepared nanostructures, results demonstrated that
SPN-PAM exhibited the highest viscosity value (1.1 cP) and the smallest
mobility ratio (0.74). This is consistent with the result obtained
from the sand pack tests. The investigation of the application of
nanofluid injections revealed that the highest secondary oil recovery
(19.28% of OOIP) could be achieved when SPN-PAM was used as the nanofluid.
It is believed that the nanoparticle was able to not only control
the mobility of the injected nanofluid and alter the wettability of
the rock surface but also facilitate the formation of a Pickering
emulsion and disjoining pressure.

Here, 1.7 g (0.008 mol) of FeCl2·4H2O and
3.6 g (0.01 mol) of FeCl3·6H2O were dissolved
in 100 mL of deionized water in a three-necked flask. The mixture
was then mixed using a magnetic stirrer under a nitrogen atmosphere
while being heated to 80 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 20 mL of
NH4OH was slowly added into the mixture, and the reaction
was continued for another hour. After the reaction, the black precipitate
was then collected using an external magnet and washed using deionized
water and ethanol. Finally, the precipitate was dried in an oven at
60 °C for 24 h, and the resulting black powder was collected
and used for further investigations.

Synthesis of OA-SPN
To prepare the OA-SPN, we employed
similar co-precipitation protocols with slight modifications. Typically,
1.8 g (0.009 mol) of FeCl2·4H2O and 4 g
(0.015 mol) of FeCl3·6H2O were mixed with
100 mL of deionized water in a three-necked flask. The mixture was
then heated to 80 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere while
being vigorously mixed using a magnetic stirrer. Afterward, 20 mL
of NH4OH was slowly added into the mixture and let to further
react for 1 h until the color of the mixture was turned into black.
Into the mixture, 0.6 mL of OA was then added while being vigorously
mixed for another 1.5 h. After the reaction, the mixture was then
cooled to room temperature and the precipitates could be collected
using an external magnet. The obtained black precipitate was then
washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove the remaining unreacted
precursors. Furthermore, the precipitate was then dried in an oven
overnight at 60 °C, and the resulting product was used for further
characterizations.

Synthesis of Core–Shell SPN@PAM
Core–shell
SPN@PAM was fabricated according to a method reported by Song and
co-workers with a slight modification.31 In this method, 1 g of the as-prepared SPN and 0.5 g of acrylamide
were mixed with 50 mL of deionized water under ultrasonic irradiation
for 40 min. Then, 0.1 g of K2S2O8 was added dropwise into the mixture while vigorously stirring using
a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was then further mixed for another
24 h at 50 °C to let the polymerization reaction occur. After
the reaction, the resulting products were separated using an external
magnet and washed with deionized water and acetone. Finally, the obtained
final product was dried in an oven overnight at 60 °C and used
for further analyses.

Synthesis of SPN-PAM
In this study, SPN-PAM was made
by incorporating SPN into the PAM polymer matrix. Here, 0.1 g of PAM
was diluted in 30 mL of deionized water while vigorously mixing at
800 rpm using a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. In a separate flask, 0.5
g of the as-prepared SPN was dispersed in 20 mL of deionized water
using ultrasonic irradiation. The SPN colloidal solution was then
slowly added to the PAM mixture, which was then stirred at 1000 rpm
at 45 °C for 8 h. Afterward, the precipitate was then collected
using an external magnet and washed with deionized water and ethanol.
Subsequently, the resulting black powder was dried in an oven at 60
°C for 24 h and collected for further investigations.

Characterization
Various types of characterization
methods were employed to study the physicochemical properties of the
samples. Here, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to
determine the crystal structures of the as-prepared SPN using PANanalytical
X’Pert Pro MPD (PANanalytical B.V., Amelo, the Netherlands)
and Cu Kα as the X-ray source. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR Spectrometer and
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using TA Q500 (TA Instrument) were
also carried out to study the attachment of surface modifiers on the
surface of SPN. Besides, the magnetic properties of the samples ware
also studied using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (OXFORD VSM
1.2H).

Measurement of Colloidal Stability
To evaluate the
effect of surface functionalization on the colloidal stability of
SPN, we measured the ζ-potential of each sample using an SZ-100
Nanoparticle Size and Zeta Potential Analyzer (Horiba Scientific).
In this study, the measurement of ζ was carried out by dispersing
0.05 g of the as-prepared samples into 10 mL of artificial brine at
different concentrations of NaCl ranging from 5000 to 30 000
ppm.

Estimation of Mobility Ratio
The potential application
of the as-prepared nanoparticles in EOR was first evaluated by estimating
the mobility of the nanofluid in porous media. According to the literature,
the mobility of the fluid in porous media (λ) can be estimated
as the ratio between the effective phase permeability (k, Darcy) and the viscosity of the fluid (μ, cp), according
to the following equation.50 1   2  Furthermore, to study the sweep efficiency
of the nanofluid to displace hydrocarbons, mobility ratio (M) was estimated by comparing the mobility of the nanofluid
(λd) and the mobility of the oil (λD), according to eq 2. In this study, the viscosity of both the nanofluid and the
oil (n-decane) at different concentrations was measured
using a Brookfield Thermosel viscometer.

Sand Pack Design and Nanofluid Flooding
A home-made
sand pack was fabricated to investigate the performance of the as-prepared
nanofluid samples in improving the oil recovery. In this study, the
flooding was done at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Here,
sand with an average particle size of 100 mesh (0.150 mm) and primarily
composed of SiO2 and CaO was utilized. The sand was packed
in a glass holder (32 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter), equipped
with stainless steel sieves to avoid any sand invasion out of the
glass holder. Figure 7 presents the experimental setup of the sand pack design.

Figure 7 Schematic diagram
of the sand pack experimental setup.

In this work, the efficiency of the nanofluid in
improving oil
recovery was initiated by injection of 2 pore volume (PV) of artificial
brine (5000 ppm of NaCl), followed by the injection of 2 PV of n-decane as the oil model to reach  water and oil saturation.
For the primary oil recovery, 1 PV of artificial brine was injected,
and the recovered oil was collected in the sample collector. Subsequently,
2 PV of the nanofluid was injected for the secondary recovery, which
was prepared by dispersing the as-prepared nanoparticle samples in
artificial brines at various concentrations, i.e., 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9%
w/v. Finally, the sand pack was further flooded with additional 3
PV of brine for the tertiary oil recovery. Here, the injection flow
rate was fixed at 0.83 mL/min (2 ft/day) to mimic the real field injection
rate.61−63 The summary of the sand pack properties and flooding
experiment is listed in Table 2.
