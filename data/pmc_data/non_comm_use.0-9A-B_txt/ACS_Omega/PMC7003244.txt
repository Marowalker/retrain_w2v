Transparent
wood (TW) was prepared by directly impregnating
the wood cell wall and cavity with index-matched prepolymerized methyl
methacrylate (MMA). In this process, lignin is retained compared with
the preparation of transparent wood in the past, making the production
faster and more energy-efficient. The innovation lies in that the
prepared transparent wood retains the natural color and texture of
the wood while transmitting light, especially under the illumination
of a specific light source, which exist as the special visual effects.
In order to enhance the practicality of the research and effectively
expand the types of home decoration materials, six common wood species
with different densities were selected in the experiment. Then the
characteristics and mechanisms of wood, that is, color difference,
light transmittance, microstructure, changes of chemical functional
groups, and tensile strength, before and after PMMA impregnating were
compared and analyzed. It is concluded that the light transmittance
and mechanical properties of the wood have been improved, and a good
synergistic effect between wood and PMMA has been confirmed by the
analysis of scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.
The above highlights make pervious to transparent wood, which has
the potential as an excellent functional decorative material.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Wood is a widely used
structural material with excellent mechanical properties due to its
unique natural growth structure.1 At the
same time, wood is also a good home decoration material owing to its
natural texture and color. Because of its many advantages, powerful
functions, and wide applications, wood attracts people to explore
and study its mechanism, including its modification, in order to broaden
more functions and uses. Among them, transparent wood as an emerging
result of wood modification is entering the people’s field
of vision with the advantages of light weight, environmental protection,
and light transmission.

Li et al.2 removed the strongly light-absorbing lignin component from the balsa
wood and obtained a nanoporous wood template. Optically transparent
wood with transmittance as high as 85% and haze of 71% was obtained
by bulk infiltration of refractive-index-matched, prepolymerized methyl
methacrylate (MMA) in the above wood template. Based on good synergic
action between the delignified wood template and PMMA, transparent
wood has high transparency, strength, and modulus; meanwhile, transparent
wood is lightweight and has low cost, so it is a potential material
for light-transmitting buildings and transparent solar cell windows.
In the same year, Zhu et al.3 fabricated
the transparent wood with a high optical transmittance (up to 90%)
and a high haze (up to 80%) by removing lignin contents from basswood
and immersing wood in PVP solution under a range of conditions. Then
they attached the transparent wood to the GaAs cell firmly. This attachment
contributed to the effective light scattering and increased light
absorption in the solar cell, so the total energy conversion efficiency
increased by 18%. In the latest research, in order to make transparent
wood to be better used in buildings and optical devices, researchers
continue to give transparent wood multifunctionalities: functional
nanoparticles are added to the polymer, which is used to fill the
nanoscale wood template. For example, Gan et al. added γ-Fe2O3@YVO4:Eu3+ nanoparticles
to a polymer to form a new type of luminescent transparent wood composite.
This material has great potential in applications including green
LED lighting equipment, luminescent magnetic switches, and anticounterfeiting
facilities.4 In the same year, Yu et al.
dispersed CsxWO3 nanoparticles
in a prepolymerized resin and filled them in the nanopores of delignified
wood to obtain transparent wood. The wood-based composite exhibits
excellent near-infrared shielding capability and high light transmission,
which is also a potential material for smart window applications.5

In recent years, the process of preparing
transparent wood has become more mature, and the performance test
has been comprehensive and meticulous. Through the study of the domestic
and foreign literature, it is found that most of the current research
directions are based on the concepts of reducing energy consumption,
paying attention to energy conservation, and environmental protection.6 Then, based on the inspiration of the frontier
topic of transparent wood, if we change the angle, for the home industry,
in the face of the continuous expansion of the field of household
materials and the demand for new materials in the home decoration
design, wood with translucency is also an excellent functional decorative
material.

The transparent wood mentioned in the above literature
is delignified; however, Li et al.7 stated
that lignin accounts for about 30% of wood and cross-links with different
polysaccharides in wood to give structural support. The removal of
lignin weakens the wood structure to a certain extent, limits the
fabrication of large structures, and also limits the choice of tree
species for the preparation of transparent wood.8 For example, pine, poplar, and other low-density tree species
are easily broken after lignin removal.9 At this time, Li et al.10 proved that
delignification is not the necessary step to fabricate transparent
wood products. Therefore, inspired by this conclusion, in this study,
all sample preparation retained lignin. Retaining lignin not only
makes the production process faster and more energy-saving but also
enriches the color and texture of home decoration materials. At the
same time, in order to enhance the practicality of the research and
effectively expand the types of home decoration materials, six common
tree species with different densities were selected in the experiment,
and transparent wood with different colors and patterns was prepared
for all tree species (not necessarily completely transparent). Besides,
a series of performance studies and comparative analysis were carried
out on them.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The samples used were six
kinds of wood veneers obtained from Yihua Lifestyle Technology Co.,
Ltd., China. These six species are Betula alnoides (Betula, A), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia
konishii Hayata, B), basswood (Tilia, C), New Zealand pine (Pinus radiataD.Don, D), oguman (Aucoumea klaineana, E), and black walnut (Juglans nigra, F). The samples were cut to 20 mm × 20 mm with a thickness
range of 0.15–0.51 mm and are shown in Figure 1. In order to facilitate the interpretation
of the article, the above six tree species are denoted as A, B, C,
D, E, and F from left to right. For these tree species, the original
wood before the experiment was collectively referred to as OW. The
air-dry densities and relative water contents of the six wood species
are shown in Table 1. Chemical reagents (analytical grade) used are the following: ethanol
absolute was produced by Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. Azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN) was supplied by Tianjin Benchmark Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Methyl methacrylate (MMA) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were all supplied
by Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd.

2.2 Fabrication of Transparent Wood
First
of all, six different kinds of wood veneer samples were heated in
an oven at 103 °C for 24 h and then stored in a drying dish.
In further experiments, in order to avoid the mutual influence between
different tree species and errors in the results of the experiment,
the sample impregnation test for each wood species was done independently
(the fabrication of transparent wood for six wood species is consistent).

As shown in Figure 2, before impregnation, the dried wood was placed in the ethanol absolute
solution to displace the moisture inside, which greatly enhanced the
permeability of the wood.11,12 NaOH solution was used
to remove the polymerization inhibitor inside the pure MMA monomer.
Then the MMA monomer was prepolymerized in a water bath at 75 °C
for 15 min with 0.35 wt % AIBN as the initiator. After 15 min, the
prepolymerized MMA solution was cooled to room temperature in an ice
water bath to terminate the reaction. Next, the wood in the ethanol
absolute solution was taken out and immersed in the prepolymerized
resin solution prepared above for half an hour under vacuum, and then
the infiltrated wood was stood for a period of time to ensure that
it was completely wetted. At last, the infiltrated wood was clamped
between two glass slides and packaged in aluminum foil before further
polymerization. The further polymerization reaction was finished by
putting the infiltrated wood sample in an oven at 70 °C for 5
h.2 For the above six tree species, the
transparent wood after the experiment was collectively referred to
as TW. If it refers to a wood species specifically, taking the B. alnoides as an example, it is called OW-A before
the experiment and TW-A after the experiment, and so, tree species
Chinese fir (B), basswood (C), New Zealand pine (D), oguman (E), and
black walnut (F) are called OW-B, OW-C, OW-D, OW-E, and OW-F before
the impregnation and TW-B, TW-C, TW-D, TW-E, and TW-F after the impregnation.

of transparent wood fabrication.

2.3 Color Difference Test
A color reader
(CR-10) was used to test the color difference between the original
wood (OW) and the transparent wood (TW). For each tree species, the
average values of five samples were tested before and after the experiment.
Moreover, the sample color selection of each tree species should be
as consistent as possible, reducing experimental errors. Here, the
material was selected from the same part of the tree species. The
color reader uses the L, a, and b three parameters for the sample readings. The L value reflects the brightness (0 means black, 100 means
white); the larger the L value is, the higher the
brightness is. The a value reflects the red-green
degree (positive value is red, negative value is green), and the b value reflects the orange-blue degree (positive value
is orange, negative value is blue). The color is deeper with the greater
absolute value of a or b.13

2.4 Light Transmittance Test
Light transmittance
of samples was measured by an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer
(Shanghai Yoke UV1900PC) under light of 350–800 nm wavelength.

2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
An FEI
Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe
the surface topography of OW and TW samples. In the experiment, the
samples were cut longitudinally along the trunk, which was a chord
section. In the microscopic structure, the inner fiber was parallel
to the plane direction of the wood. In order to observe the tightness
of the interface between the polymer and the wood fiber more clearly,
the samples were cut flat with a glass knife along the thickness direction
and adhered to the copper sheet. After spraying gold, the samples
were observed and measured by electron microscopy.

2.6 Fourier Infrared Test
Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to obtain the infrared absorption
spectra, and then the characteristic absorption peaks of OW and TW
were compared to analyze the characteristics and causes of group and
color changes before and after the OW and TW.

2.7 Mechanical
Performance Test
The tensile
properties of the wood samples before and after impregnation were
measured. At least three repeats were tested for each wood species.
The tensile properties of OW and TW were measured by using a computer-controlled
electronic universal testing machine (SANS-CMT6104). The machine stretched
in the direction of the wood grain, and the speed was set to 2 mm/min.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Color
Difference Classification and Analysis
For the three variable
values L, a, and b involved in the color difference test, the
samples OW of different wood species are first divided into two categories
based on L. The species with L values
of 45–55 are group X: black walnut (F), Chinese fir (B), and B. alnoides (A); the species with L values of 65–85 are group Y: oguman (E), New Zealand pine
(D), and basswood (C). It can be intuitively found that the wood color
of group X with lower L values is darker than that
of group Y. As shown in Figure 3, before and after the impregnation, the a and b values of the TW samples showed irregular
changes, among which L values changed regularly.
The L values of all samples decreased, and the brightness
decreased. The numerical analysis shows that, after experimental modification,
the values of the three parameters have changed, and there is no constant
quantity. It can be seen that only light and shade will change in
the end, and the hue will not change dramatically.14 The reason for the decrease in brightness is that, in the
colored phase, the brightness of yellow is high, the brightness of
red and blue is low, and the main chromogenic substance in wood is
lignin. The higher the content of lignin, the more inclined to yellow,
the higher the brightness.15 Because the
filling and aggregating of resin reduced the proportion of original
lignin in the sample, the brightness of the sample decreased after
the impregnation test. The above reflects the variation law and trend
of color differences before and after impregnation of different tree
species.

Figure 3 Surface colors of the OW and TW ((A) L value; (B) a value; (C) b value).

3.2 Light Transmittance Analysis
As can
be seen from Figure 4, the light transmittance of TW significantly improved at the wavelength
range of 400–800 nm by experimental modification; especially
for the tree species with low density and light color, such as C,
D, and E, the maximum increase of transmittance can reach 13–14%.
For F, the light transmittance increased only slightly at the wavelength
range of 500–800 nm because of the high density of the tree
species and the deep color of the wood.16 It can be seen that the light transmittance of TW prepared by light-colored
tree species increased more significantly. Since the light-transmissive
wood (TW) prepared in this paper is intended to retain the color and
texture of wood to a certain extent, lignin or other chromophoric
substances are not removed, and thus, the transmittance values of
the modified samples are lower than those of some completely transparent
woods. As shown in Figure 5, although these samples including TW-A, TW-B, TW-C, TW-D,
TW-E, and TW-F do not show high light transmittance or high haze in
daylight (samples were placed on paper printed with ″NJFU″),
these woods exhibit unique advantages and aesthetics under specific
light conditions: they can transmit light and have the natural color
and texture of wood, which is innovative and shows the potential to
be an excellent functional decorative material.

TW-C,

light conditions.

3.3 SEM Analysis
Figure 6a–d
shows the SEM images of OWC and
TWC at different magnifications. SEM showed that OW had honeycomb-like
holes, and there were obvious gaps between cell walls.17,18Figure 6c,d shows
that the holes of wood such as conduits and pits were filled with
resin and the surface was smooth and flat. Because of the filling
and polymerization of resin, the interfacial gap between PMMA and
wood fibers was reduced, and the cell walls fit snugly to each other.
Meanwhile, the porous structure of wood was almost eliminated. In
addition, other tree species were consistent with this phenomenon.
These results demonstrate that PMMA and wood template are successfully
aggregated and interact with each other. Because the wood cell wall
is similar to the refractive index of the impregnated resin (≈1.5),
according to the theorem the closer the refractive index of the two
media is, the smaller the reflectance is, the larger the transmittance
is, so the light-transmissive composite material can be obtained with
the resin curing in the wood template.19

images of OWC (a,b) and TWC (c,d).

3.4 Fourier Infrared Analysis
Figure 7a shows the infrared
spectrum of OW. The characteristic absorption peaks presented include
3330 (O–H stretching vibration), 2930 (C–H stretching
vibration), 1740 (C=O stretching vibration), 1735 (acetyl site of
hemicellulose), 1700 (fatty acid in extract), 1505 (aromatic nucleus
skeleton of lignin), and 1034 cm–1 (ether bond of
cellulose). The above is consistent with the research in the existing
literature.20,21 For A–F, although the
tree species are different, as wood, the main components are similar,
so the main stretching vibration points of the spectrum are basically
the same. The absorption peaks that exist have differences in the
degrees of height due to different contents of components at the same
point for A–F, but it does not affect the judgment of components.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra
of OW (a) and TW (b).

The infrared spectrum
of the TW after resin impregnation
polymerization not only retains some characteristic absorption peaks
of the OW but also has the characteristic absorption peaks of PMMA
(2992 and 2950 cm–1 for C–H, 1740 cm–1 for C=O, and 1191 and 1145 cm–1 for C–O),22 as shown in Figure 7b. It shows that
PMMA and wood have an excellent polymerization effect, and although
A–F are six different tree species, the changes of characteristic
peaks tend to be consistent under the same experimental conditions,
indicating that this experiment can be applied to many tree species.

3.5 Mechanical Performance Analysis
The
tensile strength was calculated by the following equations: 1   2  where σ (MPa) is the
tensile strength, which represents the maximum load carrying capacity
of the sample under static tensile conditions, F is
the maximum force that the sample is subjected to when it is broken, S is the original cross-sectional area in the tensile direction
of the sample, b is the initial width of the tensile
section of the sample, and h is the initial thickness
of the tensile section.16,23

Figure 8 shows a mechanical tensile
load–displacement diagram: during the stretching process, the
sample underwent an elastic deformation stage, a yield stage, and
a plastic deformation stage and broke finally. Because of the load
dropping sharply at the moment of the fracture and the displacement
stopping at the same time (the displacement that stopped at the moment
of force disappearance was the setting of the testing machine before
the experiment), the F value of the sample should
be at the highest point of the curve. Each sample was tested three
to five times, and the mean value of F was calculated.
Then a series of σ values were obtained according to the formula.24

Figure 8 Mechanical tensile load–displacement diagram.

The σ values of OW and TW for different tree
species are plotted as images for comparative analysis. As can be
seen in Figure 9, the
tensile strengths of all tree species increased significantly, but
the tree species were different and the increase was different. The
most notable is that of A; TW has a 40% improvement in mechanical
performance compared to OW; the smallest increase is B, and the mechanical
performance of TW is 9% higher than that of OW. Therefore, according
to the data analysis, compared with OW, TW generally has higher strength
and ductility after PMMA penetration. It also shows macroscopically
that resin and wood have a good synergistic effect, thus improving
the overall mechanical properties.

Figure 9 Tensile strengths of OW and TW.

4 Conclusions
Both
microscopic analysis
and mechanical testing revealed a good synergistic effect between
wood and PMMA. The light transmittance and tensile strength of some
tree species increased by 14 and 40%, respectively. Although the specific
values are different, the multiple species show the same trend, indicating
that this experiment is widely applicable to various kinds of wood.
The lignin is retained during the experiment so that the transparent
wood has the color and texture of natural wood, while producing is
faster and more energy-efficient. In the past literature, based on
the perspective of energy saving and consumption reduction, transparent
wood can be used as optical and electrical devices; here, for the
home industry, which has been constantly expanding in the field of
materials, it is found that transparent wood is also a highly potential
functional decorative material. Finally, the difference in color and
light transmittance of transparent wood prepared by dark and light
tree species may be caused by different factors such as lignin content,
pigment group, and extract type. The study of these blocks will be
discussed in detail in future experiments.
