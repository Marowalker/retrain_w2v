With more than a third of the genome
encoding for metal-containing
biomolecules, the in silico prediction of how metal ions bind to proteins
is crucial in chemistry, biology, and medicine. To date, algorithms
for metal-binding site prediction are mainly based on sequence analysis.
Those methods have reached enough quality to predict the correct region
of the protein and the coordinating residues involved in metal-binding,
but they do not provide three-dimensional (3D) models. On the contrary,
the prediction of accurate 3D models for protein–metal adducts
by structural bioinformatics and molecular modeling techniques is
still a challenge. Here, we present an update of our multipurpose
molecular modeling suite, GaudiMM, to locate metal-binding sites in
proteins. The approach is benchmarked on 105 X-ray structures with
resolution lower than 2.0 Å. Results predict the correct binding
site of the metal in the biological scaffold for all the entries in
the data set. Generated 3D models of the protein–metal coordination
complexes reach root-mean-square deviation values under 1.0 Å
between calculated and experimental structures. The whole process
is purely based on finding poses that satisfy metal-derived geometrical
rules without needing sequence or fine electronic inputs. Additional
post-optimizations, including receptor flexibility, have been tested
and suggest that more extensive searches, required when the host structures
present a low level of pre-organization, are also possible. With this
new update, GaudiMM is now able to look for metal-binding sites in
biological scaffolds and clearly shows how explicitly considering
the geometric particularities of the first coordination sphere of
the metal in a docking process provides excellent results.

==== Body
Introduction
With more than 30%
of the genome encoding for metal-containing
biomolecules, the study of the interactions between metal ions and
proteins bares a fundamental role in biology, pharmacy and medicine.1 Metals provide life with unique structural and
catalytic properties for transport, storage, or enzymatic functions.
Humans have taken advantage of this complementarity and now apply
it in many fields like therapy (metallodrugs) and diagnosis (biosensors)
of many diseases ranging from cancer to ulcer.2

Experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography or NMR
spectroscopy
can provide accurate or partial three-dimensional (3D) information
of the metal-bound structure of a protein, but when those data are
unreachable, the determination of the region where a metal ion could
bind must be addressed computationally.3 A complete simulation of the metal-binding process should take into
account: (1) the vast conformational space that must be explored to
detect metal-binding sites in a protein; (2) the intrinsic properties
of the first coordination sphere of the metal during binding, i.e.,
the directionality of the metal–ligand interactions or the
possible changes in the number of chemical groups bound to metal.
Nowadays, the panoply of molecular modeling methods struggles for
this kind of predictions.

To the best of our knowledge, the
available methods for predicting
metal-binding sites are based on sequence analysis or structural motif
analogies between the query and well-characterized metal-binding in
proteins.4 Those relying on sequence homology
tend to be limited to a specific subset of metal elements and protein
residues, e.g., MetalDetector v2.05 considers
transition metals and Cys or His residues; MetalPredator6 is focused on iron–sulfur proteins; SeqCHED
Server7 supports Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Mn,
Mg, and Ca, and Cys, His, Glu, or Asp residues; and ZincFinder8 is available for Zn–proteins only. Structural
motif analogies have been used by software such as mFASD,9 FINDSITE-metal,10 MIB,11 TEMSP,12 and FEATURE
metal scanning,13 the latter two limited
to Zn; however, they are restricted to a reduced subset of all possible
metal elements.

To design a metal-binding predictor with a broader
scope, we thought
of using a strategy inspired by protein–ligand dockings, since
these are designed to explore wide conformational spaces and provide
fast predictions of ligand-binding modes to proteic receptors. Although
docking is mainly focused on small organic species,14 in principle, the simplified force fields make the modifications
of energetic terms (scoring functions) more approachable than in Molecular
Mechanics, which opens some opportunities for metal implementations.
However, attempts to predict metal-binding sites with protein–ligand
dockings have only reached partial success.3c,15 Some stand on pure electrostatic models, which, despite their step
forward, fail to respect coordination rules (e.g., providing the metal
with an octahedral environment). Others, like those we recently developed
inside the GOLD framework, stand on introducing some directionality
to the vacant sites of the metal by explicitly simulating coordination
bonds but are still restricted in terms of first coordination sphere
description.16 Indeed, the user needs to
define how the metal–protein interaction should take place
in terms of angle and direction.

Here, we present a completely
different approach to the problem.
It is a new molecular descriptor (or objective) for our GaudiMM platform,25 which reproduces coordination geometries of
metal moieties. Unlike existing strategies, this objective does not
rely on structural templates extracted from large protein data sets
but on pure coordination rules (mainly geometrical) that are structure
agnostic. A benchmark of 105 structures shows that the algorithm can
find the correct binding site in 100% of the entries of the data set
and generate 3D models with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values
under 1.0 Å from the crystallographic pose. The best solutions
are always in the top 5 results, according to the coordination score
detailed below. Post-analysis including protein flexibility maintains
an excellent trend.

Computational Section
Data Set
To validate
the new GaudiMM objective,25 a data set
of 105 high-quality X-ray structures
was built. All were selected via the MetalPDB web server17 and downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).18 They feature a bare metal cation bound to one
or more side chains of a proteic host. Whereas the objective supports
any arbitrary geometry that can be provided as a set of origin-centered
vectors, the data set is focused on octahedral or derived geometries
(i.e., square pyramidal or T-shaped) having at least one vacant coordination
position (to consider possible water occupancy). Tetrahedral geometries
are easier to model: a single angle can be used for all four vertices.
Our chosen subset includes nontrivial coordination geometries commonly
found in biological scaffolds. The vacancies could be already present
in the original crystallographic structure or correspond to nonproteic
ligands (e.g., water or carbonate), which are removed before running
the calculation. The rationale behind this decision is to develop
a general method able to find any potential coordination sites with
a minimum number of donors and a compatible orientation according
to the chosen geometry. Labile ligands like water molecules are, therefore,
considered implicitly. Two additional criteria were taken into account
to select the entries: (1) it must be a high-resolution structure
(<2.0 Å when possible) and (2) no co-factors are bound to
the metal. The resulting data set includes a wide range of biologically
relevant metals (Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and donor types (NHis, –SCys, –OSer, –OTyr, –OOCAsp, –OOCGlu, SMet, OCamide, –Namide, etc.;
see Table S1 of the Supporting Information
for further details).

Setup
All structures of the data
set were prepared
using a PyChimera19 script with the following
instructions: (1) remove water and other nonproteic molecules present
in the PDB structure, (2) add hydrogen atoms with UCSF Chimera v1.1114a (“addh” command), and (3) extract
the coordinates of the bare metal ions and proteins in new, separate
Mol2 files. It must be highlighted that for the largest proteins only
one subunit chain, the one containing the binding site, was chosen
for the simulation.

Calculation Protocol
GaudiMM provides
a modular optimization
framework for molecular modeling in which multiple competing evaluation
criteria can be set up simultaneously. In GaudiMM, each iteration
of the optimization is divided in two stages: exploration and evaluation.
In the exploration stage, genes generate new possible solutions by
assigning different values to the structural properties. In the evaluation
stage, one or more objectives compute a score for each of those candidate
solutions.

The GaudiMM genes used for this benchmark were (1)
a molecule gene for the isolated protein structure, (2) another molecule
gene for the isolated metal ion, and (3) a search gene instructed
to move the metal ion within 20 Å of the crystallographic binding
site position. This search radius covers, on average, ca. 55% of the
volume of the selected proteins.

The objectives to be minimized
were (1) the evaluation of clashes
(interatomic unfavorable contacts) and (2) the coordination evaluator
set to identify any possible binding site of the ion, with at least
three donors within 3.5 Å of the metal, compatible with an octahedral
geometry. The possible donor atom types considered by the coordination
objective were Npl (trigonal planar sp2 nitrogen with a lone pair, e.g., His), O3 (tetrahedral sp3 oxygen, neutral with two lone pairs or negatively charged
with three lone pairs, e.g., R–OH/R–O– of Tyr, Ser, or Thr), O2 (trigonal sp2 oxygen with two lone pairs, e.g., ketone group of the backbone),
O2– (trigonal sp2 negatively charged
oxygen in a carboxylic group, e.g., COO– of Asp
or Glu), and S3 (tetrahedral sp3 sulfur,
neutral with two lone pairs and negatively charged with 3, e.g., R–S–R/R–S– of Met or Cys). All calculations were performed with
150 generations and an initial population size of 100 individuals.
The complete input configuration used in our benchmark can be found
in the Supporting Information. The bare
ions, extracted from the crystallographic structure, were re-docked
to reproduce the experimental binding sites without any kind of geometrical
constrains or energy restrains. The protein was treated as a rigid
body. The GaudiMM solutions were analyzed by means of GaudiView,25,20 a UCSF Chimera extension developed to browse through docking solutions
coming from GOLD, GaudiMM and others.

Coordination Objective
The coordination objective discovers
sets of donor residues able to coordinate a metal ion (bare in this
study, but it could be complexed by some ligands, if desired). Based
on an early work,21 the method evaluates
the immediate surroundings of different metal ion positions, both
chemically and geometrically, as generated by the exploration stage
of the algorithm. For each candidate, this GaudiMM objective first
analyzes the presence of suitable donor atom types within a user-defined
distance (3.5 Å by default) from the metal ion; if the number
of atoms found is high enough to fulfill the minimum number of atoms
requested (three, at least), a series of geometrical aspects are also
calculated.

First, a RMSD calculation between the ideal polyhedron
and the one obtained from the candidate’s coordination sphere
is performed with a 3D rigid implementation of the Coherent Point
Drift (CPD) algorithm.22 This term tells if the positions of the potential coordinating ligand
atoms are adequate: a value of zero will report a perfect overlap
of the atoms with the chosen coordination polyhedron. However, the
directionality of the neighbor bonds is equally important. To account
for that, for each donor found, the angles and dihedrals formed by
(1) the metal center (probe), (2) the donor atom (donor), (3) its
immediate neighbor (1st_neighbor), and (4) a nonterminal neighbor
of 1st_neighbor (2nd_neighbor) are computed and the absolute sines
of the difference between the found angles and the expected ideal
values (as calculated out of the ideal atom positions suggested by
the chimera.bondGeom module) are summed (see Figure 1). Thus, a sum equal to zero would correspond
to an ideal directionality. Since the CPD algorithm scales the ideal
polyhedron to fit the candidate vertices, the hypothetical coordination
bonds can end up being accidentally larger or shorter than expected.
We add one more term to control this error by computing the ideal
distance deviation as the absolute difference between the ideal element–element
distance reported by the chimera.bondGeom routine and the calculated
probe–donor distance. It must be noted that no assumptions
are made on the coordinating structure: the algorithm simply looks
for suitable coordinating atoms arranged in a particular geometry;
the atoms can belong to protein residues, but this does not constitute
a requirement.

Figure 1 Given a metal ion M, potential donors (D) are searched
in its surroundings.
If the distance M–D is smaller than the r threshold
for more than three potential donors, the RMSD between the donor atom
positions and the chosen ideal polyhedron (an octahedron in this figure)
is computed. If the test is successful and D is bound to another atom
(1st_neighbor), the M–D–1st_neighbor angle α is
computed. If 1st_neighbor has another nonterminal neighbor (2nd_neighbor),
the M–D–1st_neighbor–2nd_neighbor dihedral angle
θ is also computed. The absolute sines of the differences between
the calculated angles and their ideal counterparts (according to chimera.bondGeom
routines) are then calculated. Since the polyhedron matching procedure
is scalable, the absolute difference between the M–D distances
and the expected ideal coordination distances for those elements are
also computed. All the obtained terms are then summed together, and
the sum should be zero for an ideal coordination geometry.

Finally, the total score (Coord_Fitness) is calculated
by summing
the RMSD, distance deviation, and directionality terms. Smaller values
will correspond to better geometries (closer to the ideal polyhedron).
A more detailed description of the algorithm, along with discarded
alternative strategies, can be found in the Supporting Information
(Figure S1).

Results and Discussion
The capabilities to predict metal-binding sites with our upgraded
GaudiMM with coordination-aware docking features were evaluated considering
the Coord_Fitness value and computing the RMSD of each docked metal
ion versus the crystallographic coordinates. The binding site was
considered fully reproduced if the Coord_Fitness value is below 5.0
and the obtained RMSD is below 1.0 Å. In the docking benchmarks
reported in literature, the RMSD threshold applied to identify a successful
solution usually ranges from 2.0 to 3.0 Å.3c,14b,23 In our case, working with a single atom,
it is more appropriate to consider a smaller value. In combination
with the Coord_Fitness score, this criterion can help avoid false-positive
geometries. Steric clashes, measured as the volumetric overlap of
the van der Waals spheres of close atoms by the contacts objective,
were always below 3.0 Å3.

A detailed analysis
of the GaudiMM solutions for the entire data
set is summarized in Table 1, which shows that the crystallographic binding sites are
reproduced with a success rate of 100% with a RMSD ≤ 1.0 Å
by structures contained in the top 5 results. The mean of the Coord_Fitness
score is close to 4.0 units. The mean RMSD was 0.519 Å, with
an associated standard deviation value of 0.175 Å, highlighting
an error distribution very close to the mean of the set. In Figure 2, as an example,
a comparison between three simulated structures is reported.

Although for each structure, the
solution with the best value of
the coordination objective (lowest Coord_Fitness score) correctly
predicts the metal binding site, only in 86.7% of the cases the same
solution presented the best RMSD value of the run. The polyhedron
models considered in our objective are likely too ideal when it comes
to cases where the metal geometry is skewed or lacks one or more coordination
vertices. Also, the ideal distances and angles parametrized in chimera.bondGeom
are measured for generic element atom types and do not account for
partial charges, polarizabilities, etc. Since some ligands were removed
prior to the calculation (e.g., water or carbonate ions, see Computational Section), deviations from the ideal
polyhedra are expected in these systems and can explain why low-RMSD
solutions can exhibit relatively high Coord_Fitness scores (see Table 1). Even so, the proposed
geometric terms are enough in most situations: they still reach a
100% prediction power within the top 5.

To conclude this part
of the study, our updated version of GaudiMM
with metal coordination prediction capabilities provides the correct
binding site of the ions with an average success rate ranging from
ca. 87 to 100% (best RMSD value in top 1 or top 5 scores, respectively),
even if not all the coordination positions are occupied.

Dealing with
Receptor Flexibility and Rearrangement
The previous benchmark
successfully reproduced the coordination geometries
of the metal ions after exploring a rigid protein structure. Even
if the possibility of vacant sites of the metal is considered, it
could be argued that the calculation benefitted from the existing
structural pre-organization of the protein. In this second assessment,
we studied the performance of the coordination objective when considering
full side-chain flexibility. Since this obviously implies tremendously
wider computational time, we limited the test to a subset corresponding
to the highest coordinated entry for each metal, for a total of eight
structures from the complete data set (1AVW, 1AX1, 1B8C, 1B71, 1FX7, 1J5Y, 1XJS, and 3AWS). Moreover, we slightly changed the search
strategy to save the computational time and avoid possible bias (i.e.,
starting the search too close to the X-ray structure). To do so, we
applied an automated, structure-agnostic strategy that first locates
potential metal-binding sites by probing the protein space for accessible
regions in which the center of mass has β-carbon of three or
more potential coordinating amino acids (Glu, His, Asp, etc.) within
a threshold distance of 3.5 Å. The resulting script, called multisite.py,
and the accompanying documentation are included in the Supporting Information.

The three best
ranked metal-binding sites predicted with the multisite.py script
were consequently processed with GaudiMM exploring the rotameric states
of the surrounding amino acids (using the Dunbrack rotamer database24 included in the rotamers gene) and using two
objectives: clashes and coordination. It is important to highlight
that (1) from the three best ranked metal centers, the crystallographic
one was systematically identified, showing that the multisite.py script
could already be used in a standalone manner and (2) prior to the
rotameric exploration, the orientation of all residues of the potential
binding sites were randomly modified to avoid any possible bias in
the pre-organization of the receptor.

The results, detailed
in Table 2, successfully
found 87.5% of the metal centers of
this reduced data set with RMSD ≤ 1.2 Å. In 85.7% of the
correctly found sites, three coordinating donors were correctly described,
with a mean RMSD of 0.79 ± 0.34 Å.

The high success rate of this reduced data set indicates
that the
coordination objective in our metal docking approach has an excellent
predictive power even for explorations accounting for the flexibility
of the receptor. The slightly worse result with respect to the rigid
receptor exercise is likely related to the wider search space dimensionality
of considering side-chain flexibility. Improving the exploration algorithm
could potentially improve this success rate, and we are now working
at possible updates. We mainly aim to implement a smarter search procedure
and a heuristics-guided side-chain exploration gene.

Conclusions
The in silico prediction of the binding sites of metal ions in
proteic scaffolds offers many possible applications at the chemical
biology interface, like decoding the molecular processes that allowed
life to take advantage of the inorganic realm or generating alternative
metal-binding sites in proteins to provide them with novel functions
or activities (e.g., artificial enzymes). Despite its interest, standard
molecular modeling approaches fail to generate ab initio prediction
of 3D models for metal-binding poses. Conceptually, the multiobjective
genetic algorithm at the core of GaudiMM presents a suitable environment
to advance along this line: each important descriptor involved in
metal–protein interactions could be encoded as an objective.
This work presents a new objective designed to reproduce geometric
features without explicitly resorting to fine electronic details and
offers an encouraging degree of predictiveness. We believe that this
approach provides computational chemists and molecular modelers with
a novel tool to handle metal ions in their computational workflows.
