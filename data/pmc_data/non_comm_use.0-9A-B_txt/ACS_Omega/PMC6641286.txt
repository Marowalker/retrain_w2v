In the last two decades, many experiments
were conducted in self-organization
of nanocrystals into two- and three-dimensional (3D) superlattices
and the superlattices were synthesized and characterized by different
techniques, revealing their unusual properties. Among all characterization
techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the one that has allowed the
confirmation of the 3D superlattice formation due to the presence
of sharp and intense diffraction peaks. In this work, we study self-organized
superlattices of quantum dots of PbS prepared by dropping a monodispersed
colloidal solution on a glass substrate at different temperatures.
We showed that the intensity of the low-angle XRD peaks depends strongly
on the drying time (substrate temperature). We claim that the peaks
are originated from the 3D superlattice. Scanning electron microscopy
images show that this 3D superlattice (PbS quantum dots) is formed
in flake’s shape, parallel to the substrate surface and randomly
oriented in the perpendicular planes.

Introduction
Materials with dimensions
in the nanometer scale present important
changes in their physicochemical properties,1−4 being the origin of new phenomena
with important applications.5−10 More than two decades ago Ashoori11 pronounced
a commencement of a new age of science at which structures with essentially
atomic properties can be created by humans. The main feature of these
structures was a discreet electronic energy spectrum. The “artificial
atoms” that he brought to attention are also called quantum
dots (QDs). By the analogy with real atoms that can be arranged into
a periodic structure forming a crystal, these artificial atoms can
also be arranged in so called superlattices.

Simultaneously,
with the investigation of properties of single
quantum dots, the process of formation of superlattices and their
collective properties were studied. In 1995, 1 year before the existence
of artificial atoms was declared, Murray et al.12 reported on the organization of CdSe nanocrystallites into
three-dimensional (3D) quantum dot superlattices.

Soon after
the pioneering works, it became clear that unlike unorganized
particles, nanocrystals arranged into superlattices can have unusual
collective properties that were demonstrated on magnetic nanoparticles,
where energy exchange in exchange-spring magnets (structures composed
of magnetically hard and soft phases) exceeded by over 50% of the
predicted theoretical limit.13

After
more than a decade of the study of superlattices, Nie et
al.14 differentiated four different strategies
of the self-assembly of nanoparticles: in solution, using templating
methods, at interfaces, and assisted by different factors. Here, in
this work, we will focus on the evaporation-induced self-assembly
superlattices based on quantum dots at the liquid–solid interfaces.15−17 Using this strategy, different types of nanoparticles were organized:
3d-transition metal nanoparticles (Co, Ni, and Fe),12,18,19 magnetic,20 and
semiconductor.14,15,21−23 The superlattices were formed by monodispersed12,24 and bidispersed nanoparticles15,21−23,25,26 (nanoparticles of two distinct sizes). Recent works conducted by
Weidman et al.27,28 allowed to see the process of
formation of superlattices of PbS monodispersed quantum dots in situ
and showed that during this process, different structural transformations
can occur.

Similar to atomic crystalline lattices, these superlattices
can
diffract light with wavelengths comparable with the period of the
arrangement of the dots. Quantum dots consist of hundreds of atoms
and can have different shapes,29,30 as well as their sizes
can vary significantly in the range up to 100 nm. Investigation of
the superlattices that are formed by nanocrystals with diameters up
to 10 nm with conventional X-ray diffraction and scattering techniques
(XRD,12,22,23,25 small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),18,19 and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS)24,27−29,31) that utilize light
generated by X-ray tubes (W, Mo, Cu, Ag, Ga, and In) and synchrotron
radiation19 reveal a constructive interference
of the light in the region of the low angles up to a few degrees.
These peaks that appeared at a specific angular region carry information
about the quantum dot arrangement, like interplanar distances and
type of crystalline lattice.

Real atoms can form both glassy
(amorphous) and crystalline solids,
and the crystallization process depends on the cooling rate: lower
the rate, higher the level of the crystalline order. By analogy with
this natural process, we proposed a hypothesis that for the colloidal
quantum dots, the level of organization will depend on the drying
time. In this work, by changing the temperature of the substrate and
setting the drying time, we show that the intensity of the XRD peaks
in the low-degree region increases as the drying time is increased.
This reflects the organization of quantum dots. Moreover, the decay
rate of the intensity of these peaks as a function of the diffraction
angle (order of diffraction) is also indicative of ordering and size
of the quantum dots’ superlattice size in the direction perpendicular
to the sample surface.

Experimental Section
Materials
Lead(II)
oxide (PbO, yellow powder 99.99%),
hexamethyldisilathiane (synthesis grade), trioctylphosphine (90% technical
grade), toluene (laboratory reagent, ≥99.3%), tetrachloroethylene
(>99%), chloroform (≥99.8%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90% technical
grade), oleic acid (technical grade 90%), and n-octane
(anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased by Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Synthesis of PbS Nanocrystals
The synthesis of PbS
nanocrystal stock solution was performed following a procedure from
the literature.32 In a typical synthesis,
360 mg of PbO and 3380 mg of oleic acid were added to 10 mL of 1-octadecene
(1-ODE), a non-coordinating solvent, and stirred under vacuum at 110
°C for 6 h, with the formation of a transparent solution. Thereafter,
this lead oleate solution was heated until 150 °C and then the
solution of sulfur precursor, bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (160 μL)
in 1-ODE (2 mL), was rapidly injected. At this stage, it was observed
that there was formation of a dark brown solution, which corresponds
to oleic-acid-capped PbS quantum dots. Subsequent to synthesis, the
nanocrystals were purified by precipitating in a nonsolvent. This
was performed by adding 25 mL of acetone to the reaction product,
followed by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 5 min. With an
aim to remove the excess of oleic acid and impurities, three centrifugation
steps were executed. The supernatant was discarded, and the obtained
precipitate was dried under nitrogen flow and redispersed in toluene,
with a final concentration of 50 mg/mL.23

Self-Organization of PbS Nanocrystals
The initial colloidal
solution of PbS quantum dots in toluene (with a concentration of 50
mg/mL) was precipitated by centrifugation and dried and diluted to
5 mg/mL in n-octane, and 100 μL of the new
solution was dropped on round microscopy cover slips (0.17 mm thickness,
24 mm diameter) and placed on hot plates at four different temperatures,
room temperature (RT ∼ 25 °C), 60, 100, and 140 °C.
Because of the different temperatures, the dropped solutions dried
for different times: RT, 300 s; 60 °C, 110 s; 100 °C, 50
s; and 140 °C, 45 s. As a result, grayish black inhomogeneous
films were formed on the glass substrates (Figure 1a).

range (blue lines indicate position and relative intensity of the

Characterization
The PbS quantum dots and the formed
films were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM), absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.

After preparation of the films of PbS quantum dots, the XRD patterns
were recorded in the range of 1–50° using a Rigaku RINR2000
Series diffractometer. SEM was performed on FEI Helios Nanolab 660.
HR-TEM analysis was conducted in a TEM-HR Jeol 3010 electron transmission
microscope. The microscope was operated at 300 kV, with a point resolution
of 0.17 nm. To conduct size distribution analysis of the quantum dots,
one separate sample with a lower concentration (less than 0.1 mg/mL)
was dropped onto carbon-coated copper grids. A histogram was obtained
by a manual measurement of the particle size on bright field TEM images
and by automatically counting the particles using free software (Gwyddion
and ImageJ). Around 500 particles were analyzed. Absorption spectra
were recorded using an Ocean Optics NIRQuest 256 spectrometer. Photoluminescence
(PL) measurements were performed using a He–Ne laser (632.8
nm, 1 mW, beam diameter 4 mm) as the excitation light and detected
by an Imaging spectrometer iHR320 (Horiba) coupled with a InGaAs-CCD
(Andor) cooled by liquid nitrogen (DSS-IGA020L). Room-temperature
PL was analyzed from initial colloidal solution of the PbS quantum
dots (in a quartz cuvette) and from the dots self-organized on the
substrates.

Results and Discussion
Quantum Dots of PbS
Figure 1b shows the
size distribution of the prepared
quantum dots revealed by HR-TEM (HR-TEM image of individual quantum
dots used to extract size distribution is presented in the Supporting Information). The calculated mode
(most frequent) diameter of the nanocrystals was 4.3 nm and experimental
data were well fitted by the Gaussian function, with a standard deviation
of 0.6 nm (23%).

Figure 1c shows an excitonic peak in the absorption spectrum at 1160
nm and the PL peak at around 1270 nm. The peak in the absorption spectrum
confirms the presence of quantum confinement, and in PL spectrum,
a stabilization (passivation) of the surface of quantum dots is caused
by oleic acid. We also estimated the mean particle diameter using
a model proposed by Moreels et al.33 On
the basis of the model, a solution of the equation: 0.0252d2 + 0.283d – 1/(Eg – 0.41) = 0 gives the mean diameter d of quantum dots. From the absorption spectrum, we estimated
the optical band gap Eg to be 1.07 eV,
chose 0.41 eV as a bulk band gap, and solved the equation obtaining
the mean diameter to be 3.96 nm, which is in a good agreement with
HR-TEM and XRD results.

Figure 1d shows
an XRD pattern of the quantum dots, which revealed a PbS face-centered
cubic (fcc) arrangement of the lattice. We indexed peaks that correspond
to the next planes: 25.99° to (111); 29.89° to (200); 42.90°
to (220); 50.50° to (311); 53.30° to (222); 62.30°
to (400); 68.40° to (311); 70.30° to (420); 78.60°
to (422), and 84.50° to (511). The peaks are in good agreement
with the previously reported values,34 proving
the formation of quantum dots of PbS. Using Scherrer’s formula,35 with coefficient K = 0.9 for
spherical particles, we calculated an average size using a width of
the (111) and (200) peaks and found that their values are 3.46 and
3.39, respectively, which are about 1 nm less than those found by
analyzing TEM images. The reason for this can be explained by the
presence of oleic acid molecules (length 1.98 nm) around the dots
that provokes an additional contrast on the TEM images increasing
the actual size of individual quantum dots.

Films Made from PbS Quantum
Dots
Figure 2a shows the low-angle XRD region (up to 15°)
of the XRD spectra at which a set of intense sharp peaks spaced at
∼1.78° are observed for the film prepared at longest drying
time, 300 s (Table 1 summarizes the position and relative intensity of observed peaks).
The analysis of the position of the peaks reveals that there is only
one reflecting plane that results in the formation of the peaks and
the positions of the peaks obey Bragg’s law 2d sinθ = nλ, with increasing order
of diffraction n.

These peaks become weaker for the films deposited
at shorter time
(110 and 55 s) and completely disappear for the film deposited during
45 s. Similar peaks were previously observed for films of PbS quantum
dots by Altamura et al.22 and Corricelli
et al.23,25 and for 4.8 nm (estimated by TEM) CdSe quantum
dots.12,36 The authors have attributed these peaks
to the ordered arrangement of nanocrystals perpendicular to the substrate
plane. In our experiment, each film had the same amount of material
and the intensity of the peaks of PbS in the region from 20 to 50°
remained the same for all four samples, as displayed in Figure 2b. On the basis of these results,
we were able to compare the intensity of the low-angle XRD peaks between
the samples. The inset in the Figure 2a shows the peak’s intensity plotted as a function
of the diffraction angle. One can observe that the intensity of the
sharp peaks decreases considerably as the drying time decreases, which
indicates a lower organization (3D superlattice) in the planes parallel
to the substrate surface. The exponential decay fittings (I(2θ) = I0 e–λ·2θ, where λ is the exponential
decay constant expressed in degree–1) show a quicker
decay as the drying time decreases (for the samples found to be λ300s = 3.94, λ110s = 3.68, and λ50s = 3.31). Decrease of the exponential decay rate, λ,
indicates that the superlattice organization in the perpendicular
direction to the sample surface is also lower as the drying time decreases.
We also plotted the 3rd peak at 5.24° for all of the samples
(Figure 2c) and show
that its intensity monotonically increases with the drying time (Figure 2d).

The spacing
(1.78°, 2θ) between these sharp peaks reflects
an interplanar distance of 5.02 nm according to Bragg’s law
(λKα = 0.15418 nm, n = 1).
This distance is different from the size of the quantum dots (estimated
by XRD, 3.4 nm), together with the length of the molecule of oleic
acid (1.98 nm). Zherebetskyy et al.37 demonstrated
that oleic acid molecule links weakly to the apolar PbS (001) surface
by the carboxylic acid group, coordinating the hydrogen on the S2– species and the oxygen on the Pb2+ species,
whereas the oleate and hydroxylate anions link strongly to the polar
PbS (111) by carboxylate groups on the Pb2+ species. Thus,
the calculated size of the quantum dot together with oleic acid molecule
will be 3.4 nm + (2 × 1.98) nm = 7.36 nm, which is much higher
than the distance observed by XRD. We can explain this by intercalation
of the molecules of oleic acid from the adjacent quantum dots such
that the distance between the dots will be calculated as 3.4 nm +
(2 × 1.98) nm/2 nm = 5.38 nm. This value is similar to the one
retrieved from XRD measurements. Another explanation could be that
this difference can be a result of the inducted attractive force between
the quantum dots, which should predominate over the repulsive force
for this short distance (5.02 – 3.40 = 1.62 nm). Thereby, a
compression of the oleic acid, placed between QDs, is expected. A
similar relation between PbS quantum dot size estimated from Scherrer’s
formula and a distance calculated from the peak position in SAXS was
observed by Baranov et al.:38 for the PbS
quantum dots with diameter 3.2 nm, interdot spacing was around 5.4
nm. This difference also was attributed to the presence of the oleic
acid molecule between quantum dots, whereas the presence of the peak
itself was assigned to the quantum dot superlattice.

To observe
a constructive interference of X-ray light, the probing
system should have reflecting planes perpendicular to the plane formed
by the incident and reflected light. From this perspective, the presence
of only one peak attributed to the superlattice, which is a three-dimensional
arrangement of the quantum dots and does not look very consistent.
To better understand the origin of these peaks, we obtained SEM images
of the samples for different drying times. Figure 2e,f shows images of the sample dried for
300 s. SEM images of the samples prepared at lower drying times can
be found in the Supporting Information.
For the sample dried for 300 s, we observed that quantum dots precipitated
in the form of flakes, with a thickness/width ratio higher than 10.
These flakes should be oriented randomly in the planes perpendicular
to the substrate surface, and formation of such an organized structure
may perfectly explain the presence of only one interferential peak
in XRD spectra. From the SEM images, we estimated a thickness of the
flakes between 20 and 40 nm, which would correspond to 5–8
layers of quantum dots (5–8 sharp peaks in XRD spectra). With
decreasing of the drying time, the sizes of flakes decrease and they
become fractured, indicating an evidence of diminish in the degree
of the quantum dots’ organization (see SEM images in the Supporting Information). The precipitation process
of PbS QDs should be governed by the increasing of QDs concentration
during the drying process, which would provoke the QDs’ coalescence
and its precipitation onto the substrate surface. Note that the electrostatic
and steric forces dominate the stability of colloidal suspension.39 Therefore, a great decrease of the distance
between QDs during the drying process must provoke the inductive electrostatic
force (attractive) to overcome the steric force, causing the QDs’
coalescence. Thereby, the equilibrium between the attractive and repulsive
forces between quantum dots determines the formation of the organized
lattices similar to the crystal formation.

We paid special attention
to the fact that during the formation
of quantum dots together with the passivation of dots’ surfaces,
a separate phase of lead oleate can be formed. In 1949, Vold et al.40 showed that during drying of different metal
soaps, the metal ions can be arranged in parallel planes separated
by a distance somewhat less than twice that of the fatty acid radical
that results in the appearance of the X-ray diffraction pattern. Robinet
et al. studied lead palmitate, stearate, and oleate phases and showed
that a set of sharp peaks appear in their low-angle X-ray pattern.41 To avoid a possibility for these peaks to be
originated from the lead oleate phase, we specially washed a sample
four times by centrifugation and separated the precipitated quantum
dot phase from the supernatant and redissolved it again in a fresh
solvent four times. Also, we separately prepared a solution of lead
oleate in n-octane and dropped the same amount of
it on the glass substrate at RT and at elevated temperatures. We observed
a set of sharp peaks similar to that from the literature,41 but the peaks did not diminish in their intensity
when we shortened their drying time, similar to that observed in the
X-ray pattern of the quantum dots (from 20 to 50°). We also mentioned
that low-angle XRD peaks of lead oleate rapidly disappear with time
(1 week) when the sample is stored at RT in the laboratory, whereas
peaks of the quantum dot films remain unchanged for months (peaks
were repeatedly recorded from the same samples 4 months after the
fabrication).

Figure 2g shows
PL spectra of the films of PbS quantum dots deposited during different
drying times. Even though a significant change in the XRD spectra
of the films was observed (Figure 2a,c,d), their PL spectra does not have any notable
changes. The shift was only observed between quantum dots in solution
and deposited on a substrate, which is similar to that observed by
Choi et al.,42 where the authors also showed
that the position of the PL peak depends on the distance between dots,
and moreover, the exciton dissociation is attributed to the resonant
energy transfer rather than to the direct charge transfer. Our results
suggest that the average distance between the quantum dots remains
approximately the same but the level of organization changes with
the drying time.

Conclusions
We prepared a colloidal
solution of PbS quantum dots and deposited
it on a glass substrate at different temperatures. We showed that
by varying the temperature of the substrate and setting the drying
time, we can control the level of the ordering of quantum dots. We
associated the intensity of low-angle XRD peaks with the level of
ordering and showed that the intensity increases as the drying time
is increased. The decay rate of intensity (sharp peaks) as a function
of the diffraction angle also indicates the level of ordering in a
perpendicular direction to the sample surface, revealing an increase
as the drying time increases. SEM images of the films of precipitated
PbS quantum dots reveal the formation of flakes in parallel orientation
to the sample surface and randomly oriented in perpendicular planes.
For the sample dried for 300 s, the thickness of these flakes is estimated
between 20 and 40 nm, corresponding to 5–8 layers (PbS quantum
dots), which is attributed to the sharp peaks (low-angle XRD) observed
with appreciable intensity. PL measurements showed that even though
the quantum dots get more organized during longer drying time, the
position of their PL peak remains unchanged, suggesting that the proximity
between quantum dots is approximately the same. A detailed study of
the formation of 3D superlattice, varying the drying time at the same
temperature, is necessary to understand better the complex process
of ordered precipitation of nanostructures.
