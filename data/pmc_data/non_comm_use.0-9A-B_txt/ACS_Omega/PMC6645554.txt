The synthesis of
microgels with pH-tunable swelling leads to adjustable
and pH-responsive substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS)-active nanoparticles (NPs). Sterically stabilized and cross-linked
latexes were synthesized from random copolymers of styrene (S) and
2-vinylpyridine (2VP). The pH-dependent latex-to-microgel transition
and swellability were tuned based on their hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic
content established by the S/2VP ratio. The electrostatic loading
of polystyrene/poly(2-vinylpyridine) microgels [PSxP2VPy (M)] with anions such as
tetrachloroaurate (AuCl4–) and borate-capped
Ag NPs was quantified. The PSxP2VPy (M) can load ∼0.3 equiv of AuCl4– and the subsequent photoreduction results
in Au NP-loaded PSxP2VPy (M) with NPs located throughout the structure. Loading PSxP2VPy (M) with
borate-capped Ag NPs produces PSxP2VPy (M) with NPs located on the surface of the
microgels, where the Ag content is set by S/2VP. The pH-responsive
SERS activity is also reported for these Ag NP-loaded microgels. Analytical
enhancement factors for dissolved crystal violet are high (i.e., 109 to 1010) and are set by S/2VP. The Ag NP-loaded
microgels with ∼80 wt % 2VP exhibited the most stable pH dependent
response.

Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) is a highly sensitive
spectroscopic technique for analyzing and detecting simple to complex
collections of molecules or biological structures.1,2 The
sensitivity arises from a SERS effect that results from a large enhancement
of the Raman scattering cross section of molecules that are in close
proximity to metal surfaces.3,4 Many theoretical and
experimental studies indicate that the excitation of surface plasmons
in such metals leads to a localized electromagnetic field that greatly
enhances the sensitivity in SERS measurements.5−9 The excitation of surface plasmons depends on factors
such as metal type, surface roughness, and for nanostructures, their
size, shape, proximity, and packing architecture.10,11 In certain static arrangements with nano- to molecular-scale interparticle
gaps, “hot spots” have been reported which have extremely
high SERS sensitivity12−15 and the ability to detect single molecules.16−18 The concept
of a SERS substrate capable of dynamically tuning SERS-active particle
distances is, therefore, attractive. Example systems include the following:
the swelling of gels with embedded nanoparticles (NPs),19−21 mechanical stretching of elastomeric substrates bearing silver (Ag)
NPs,22 wrinkling of metal and composite
films on thermally contracting polymers,23−25 inducing morphology
changes of interparticle ligands through pH adjustments,26,27 and aggregation of NPs within magnetic fields.28,29

The simplest SERS experiments are performed by delivering
analytes
to a suspension of metal NPs of Ag or gold (Au). The main drawback
for such experiments is that the NPs are prone to aggregation, which
reduces the reproducibility of the SERS effect. Accordingly, anchoring
SERS-active NPs to water-dispersible polymer substrates has been explored
as a mode for stabilizing the SERS sensitivity. Platforms based on
polystyrene (PS),30 polyurethane,31 polyacrylic acid, and polyallylamine32 have shown promise in this regard. Loading stimuli-responsive
microgels with NPs has resulted in interesting composites with new
properties such as catalytic activity, optical, magnetic, and pH response.33−43 The use of microgels to stabilize the SERS activity of Ag NPs is
less well-explored.44 Previously, Armes
and Nakamura et al. have studied the pH-responsiveness and Au NP loading
of lightly cross-linked and sterically stabilized poly(2-vinylpyridine)
(P2VP) microgels.45,46 The Au NP-loaded P2VP microgels
studied in their work demonstrated a reversible pH-sensitive plasmon
absorbance. Homopolymers, block copolymers, and random copolymers
of 4-vinylpyridine and 2VP are widely exploited for their ability
to carry a positive charge at a pH lower than 5.0.47−49 Microgels of
P2VP are promising candidates for such a role owing to the multifunctionality
of the pyridine residues located throughout the macromolecular network.
Aqueous protonation of pyridinylenes in lightly cross-linked P2VP
results in significant polymer solvation and swelling, while electrostatic
and ligand coordination to metal ions can also occur in P2VP materials.50

We present herein the synthesis of sterically
stabilized latexes
consisting of random copolymers of PS and P2VP [PSxP2VPy (L)]. The dimensions of the
latex and its transition to a microgel are studied by titration with
monitoring by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The loading of the microgel
state with Au ions for subsequent Au NP synthesis is explored. The
loading of the copolymer microgels with borate-capped Ag NPs is also
described. The Ag NP-loaded microgels exhibit SERS activity demonstrated
by detection of pyridinyl groups in the polymer support as well as
the detection of a dissolved analyte, crystal violet (CV). A reversible
pH-dependent response for the intensity of the SERS spectra for CV
is found. The most pH-responsive Ag NP-loaded microgel contains nominal
P2VP and PS content values of 80 and 20%, respectively, and operates
with a high analytical enhancement factor (AEF) of 1.08 × 1010 and a greater stability than the analogous microgel that
lacks the PS content.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of PSxP2VPy Latexes
An emulsion polymerization approach
was selected for the synthesis of sterically stabilized pH-responsive
microgels45,46,51 with a tuned
hydrophilic: hydrophobic ratio. Scheme 1 outlines the emulsion polymerization that leads to
a copolymer latex of S, 2VP, divinylbenzene (DVB), and poly(ethylene
glycol)methyl methacrylate (PEGMA). Previous reports have shown that
analogous latexes without the PS component are water-dispersible over
a large pH range because of the PEGMA-derived PEG-corona on individual
particles.45,46 This PEG corona stabilizes the
latex and any resulting microgels from aggregation or precipitation
by providing a steric repulsion between particles.46 At 60 °C, the monomer reactivity ratios (r) for styrene and 2VP are rs = 0.55 and r2VP = 1.14, respectively.52 The product of rsr2VP is 0.63. Commonly, the range for r1r2 is 0–3, with an
ideal copolymerization having r1r2 = 1. The copolymerization of S and 2VP is
therefore classified as moderately ideal.53 Also, because the two r values are similar, the
two different monomers can be expected to show equal reactivity toward
the propagating radical chain ends in the latex.53 Because the reactivity of the monomers is relatively equivalent,
the S/2VP ratio in the latex should closely match the nominal S/2VP
monomer synthesis ratio, and these two units will likely be randomly
included during polymerization.54 Entries
1–5 in Table 1 outline the effect of varying certain synthetic parameters on the
mean DH and polydispersity as determined
by DLS. Solvent-free diameters, as determined from scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analyses are also reported in this table. Generally,
as the nominal weight percent of 2VP is tuned from 40 to 100%, the DH values of the latex (DH,L) at a pH condition of approximately 5 are found to increase
from ∼400 to ∼540 nm, while the polydispersity values
remained within the range of 0.017–0.063. The increase in diameter
with increasing 2VP content suggests that the polarity of neutral
P2VP units, and any conjugate acids (P2VP+) units, require
additional volume in the colloid to hydrate and accommodate additional
counter ions. The DH,L and polydispersity
values for these entries in Table 1 are also in agreement with previous and analogous
sterically stabilized P2VP latexes.45,46 An interesting
deviation in the trend of increasing DH,L with increasing nominal P2VP content was found for the PS40P2VP60 latexes [PS40P2VP60 (L), Table 1, entry 3], which
may be because of a latex with polymer chains in an unrelaxed conformation
owing to the kinetic conditions of the polymerization. After a transition
to a microgel, the diameter of the PS40P2VP60 particle is in agreement with the observed trend for others in the
series. The SEM images of solvent-free packed colloids [some exhibiting
face-centered cubic (FCC) packing] for the PS0P2VP100 (L), PS20P2VP80 (L), PS40P2VP60 (L), PS50P2VP50 (L), and
PS60P2VP40 (L) are shown in Figure 1a–e. The characteristic
for low polydispersity in the diameter of the particles is also evident
in these images where efficient hexagonal packing of highly uniform
particles occurs for all of the materials in this series. Because
latex particles are known to pack in an FCC arrangement, the layers
in Figure 1a–e
represent a (111) plane of the FCC lattice. The number average diameters
for the dried latexes (DN,L) were obtained
from the SEM images by averaging 5 separate distance measurements,
which came from five different and central particles in a close packed
seven-particle hexagon. This value is, therefore, determined by measuring
the distance between contact points between particles that were in
the same plane and row in the packed arrays. In an FCC lattice, these
measurements are along the ⟨110⟩ direction (or other
geometric equivalents), and hence we provide diameter measurements
along this direction with a DN,L,⟨110⟩ label. As expected, the DN,L,⟨110⟩ values were lower than the DH,L values
found by DLS. The trend for increasing DN,L,⟨110⟩ with increasing P2VP content was also found in these data (Table 1).

pH-Responsive Latex from a Random Copolymer of Styrene and 2-Vinylpyridine
[PSxP2VPy (L)]

In this work, the molar amounts
of the PEGMA steric stabilizer, Aliquat 336 surfactant, and the DVB
cross-linker were held constant and in proportion to the total molar
amount of the remaining monomers, styrene (S) and 2VP. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic
ratio is tuned by adjusting the molar amounts of S and 2VP in the
emulsion polymerization.

a All latexes were
nominally synthesized
with additional PEGMA (9.0 wt %), Aliquat 336 (3.1 wt %), and DVB
(1.0 wt %).

b The values were
estimated by averaging
5 particles in an SEM image. In the case of entries 1–5, the DN,L values correspond to the diameter along
the ⟨110⟩ direction of an FCC lattice (DN,L⟨110⟩) and were determined by averaging
five central and hexagonally packed particle diameters along the ⟨110⟩
direction of an FCC lattice.

c The values were estimated from DLS
measurements at 20 °C. The polydispersity = |μ2/Γ2|, where μ2 is the second cumulant
and Γ is the average decay rate determined by the CONTIN analysis.

d The values were estimated from
the
char mass at 775 °C in the TGA plot. In the case of Au- and Ag
NP-loaded microgels, the mass is assumed to represent the metal-loading
values for the composites.

The balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic (PS and P2VP units,
respectively) properties control the water content in the latex particles
and consequently may lead to plastic deformation in the dried particles.
Cross-linked latexes rich in PS retain their spherical shape when
dried because they do not incorporate significant amounts of water
at a neutral pH. Latex particles rich in P2VP incorporate small amounts
of water that act as a plasticizer to permit polymer flow. This polymer
flow can cause a distortion from a spherical shape during the drying
process. Inspection of the SEM images in Figure 1 reveals an interesting trend in the evolution
of the shape of the solvent-free PSxP2VPy (L). These images depict near-monodisperse
particles from dried latexes that were synthesized with a similar
amount of PEGMA and Aliquat 336 (9.0 and 3.1 wt %, respectively).
As the nominal weight percent of 2VP is tuned from 40 to 100%, the
dried and hexagonally packed particles evolve away from a spherical
morphology and take on a distorted shape that arises from gradual
occupation of the octahedral and tetrahedral void space in the packed
monolayer lattices. This distorted shape is a common characteristic
of soft or low glass transition (Tg) polymer
latexes that dry in packed arrays.55 It
is clear that as the nominal weight content of the P2VP increases,
the extent of distortion of the spherical latex also increases. This
distortion is greatest along the direction that extends from the center
of a particle and points toward the voids (for FCC-type packing, the
⟨121⟩ direction bisects octahedral and tetrahedral voids).
Conversely, the distortion is minimal along the ⟨110⟩
direction of the lattice where packed spheres contact each other.
The distortion is assumed to arise from strong capillary stresses
acting on the colloids as water dries from unoccupied space between
3-D packed colloids. The ratio of DN,L,⟨121⟩ to DN,L,⟨110⟩ represents
a metric for quantifying the extent of distortion in the packed spheres.
The DN,L,⟨121⟩ to DN,L,⟨110⟩ ratio is plotted versus
the nominal P2VP weight content and shown in Figure 1f. The trend suggests that when the nominal
P2VP content exceeds 60 wt %, distortion along the ⟨121⟩
direction becomes significant and can be tuned according to the P2VP/PS
ratio. The uniform trend in the DN,L,⟨121⟩ to DN,L,⟨110⟩ ratio suggests
that the synthesis of the copolymer latex is one that permits a high
degree of stoichiometric control, which can be used to adjust the
ability of the particles to undergo plasticization by water.

pH-Response
of the PSxP2VPy Latex Particles
The tuned content of pyridine
groups in the latexes contributes to the amount of pH-triggered swelling
in these lightly cross-linked materials. Protonation of these groups
can result in significant electrostatic forces and an increased volume
due to solvation of water and ions within the polymer particles. A
representation of the molecular transformation that results from the
treatment of the highly neutral PSxP2VPy (L) with a general Brønsted–Lowry
acid (HX) is shown in Scheme 2. Measurements by DLS were used to monitor the DH of selected PSxP2VPy (L) in water with 0.1 M NaCl over the course
of a titration with 0.1 M HCl. These DH versus pH titration curves are found in Figure 2a. The initial DH values of the latexes are largely in agreement with data reported
in Table 1. Most latexes
exhibited stable DH values until pH ∼4.
Each PSxP2VPy (L) eventually underwent a significant size change upon treatment
with acid and consequently transitioned to a microgel state with a
larger diameter. The diameter of the microgel also appears to be independent
of pH. Previous work has shown that analogous P2VP latexes undergo
this swelling transition very rapidly, roughly requiring only 100–150
ms.46 The polydispersity values for the
resulting microgels all remained within a range of 0.028–0.876
(Table 1). The DH associated with the microgel state is listed
as DH,M in Table 1, where P2VP-rich microgels had the largest DH,M and those that were more PS-rich had the
smallest DH,M. A linear correlation was
found between the DH,M and the nominal
P2VP weight content of the microgels (Figure 2b), which emphasizes the degree of synthetic
control for generating a uniform distribution of P2VP+ units
throughout the microgels. It is also evident that as the P2VP content
in the latex is increased, the degree of change in DH of the resulting microgel also increases. The evolution
in the DH,M to DH,L ratio versus the nominal weight percent of P2VP in the
latex is reported in Figure 2c. Again, a linear correlation was found for this plot, further
emphasizing the degree of synthetic control on the swellability in
the microgels made possible by including tailored amounts of PS in
the macromolecular network. A volumetric swelling ratio can be calculated
from the DH,M and DH,L values to quantify this characteristic. The volumetric
swelling factor for the latex with no PS content (PS0P2VP100) was 140, while that for the most PS-rich in the series
(PS60P2VP40) was 2.5. The titration curves in Figure 2a can also be used
to determine an average pKa value for
the pyridinyl groups in each microgel. All pKa values were found to be less than those for P2VP homopolymer
(pKa ≈ 4.92).56,57 Armes et al. have previously observed a linear dependence for the
pKa of P2VP with a DVB cross-linker.46 The decreasing pKa with an increasing cross-linker content was suggested to arise from
a combination of the “polyelectrolyte effect” and macromolecular
swelling strain.58 Unique to this work,
we have observed that the pKa of the P2VP
can be tuned by adjusting the content of hydrophobic PS. Shown in Figure 2d is the plot for
the dependency of the pKa versus the nominal
weight percent of P2VP in the latex. In this case, a linear trend
was found for the correlation of pKa with
P2VP content. Enthalpic penalties associated with exposure of PS segments
to water are reflected in the overall pKa of the microgel. Utilizing hydrophobic PS content for tuning the
pH-responsive properties of pyridinyl groups in microgels represents
a novel method and one that may allow for better matching of the conditions
and specificity needed for various applications such as pH-reporting,59,60 catalysis,61−63 and molecular detection via SERS.44,64

Loading of PSxP2VPy Microgels with AuCl4– Ions
The electrostatic loading of the selected PSxP2VPy (M) with anionic species
such as AuCl4– and borate-caped Ag NPs
was investigated. Experiments were designed to probe the effect of
loading anionic materials in an aqueous condition with a pH below
the pKa values of the microgel. Two routes
to metal NP microgels (e.g.,, PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs and PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs) are possible,
and these are distinguished in Scheme 3. To achieve PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs, aurate-loaded microgels (e.g.,
PSxP2VPy (M)/AuCl4–) were prepared using acidic conditions.
Solutions of PS20P2VP80 (M) and PS40P2VP60 (M) had their pH set to 2.5 using 0.1 M HCl, while
that for PS60P2VP40 (M) required a pH of 1.2.
Measurements by DLS were used to monitor the size of the PS20P2VP80 (M) as the solution was titrated with KAuCl4. In this experiment, the pH of the KAuCl4 was
adjusted to match the pH of the PSxP2VPy (M) solution. The plot in Figure 3a reports the evolution in
the DH of PS20P2VP80 (M) as increasing amounts of KAuCl4 are introduced (shown
as equivalents of KAuCl4 to 2VP units). The initial DH of the microgel was ∼1980 nm and was
found to decrease exponentially. The introduction of only 0.05 equiv
of KAuCl4 results in a decrease in DH to ∼1420 nm, which corresponds to a volume that is
only 37% of that of the initial state. This dramatic contraction confirms
a strong electrostatic cross-linking throughout the macromolecular
network. This volume contraction continues as more KAuCl4 is delivered, with an ultimate plateau value for a DH of 960 nm once ∼0.30 equivalents are bound (DH,M in entry 6 in Table 1). The final pH of the PS20P2VP80 (M)/AuCl4– solution was similar to that of the initial
condition. McPhee et al. have also found that an ultimate DH is achieved in the titration of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels with a sub-equimolar amount
of sodium dodecylsulfate.65 Stable PS40P2VP60 (M)/AuCl4– and PS60P2VP40 (M)/AuCl4– were also produced from the introduction of 0.3 molar equivalents
of KAuCl4. The DH values of
these samples were also observed to decrease in a similar manner as
the KAuCl4 is incorporated into the microgels (entries
7 and 8 in Table 1).
The polydispersity values of the PSxP2VPy (M)/AuCl4– samples
remained relatively low. Conversion of the aurate-loaded microgels
to their latex state [termed PSxP2VPy (L)/AuCl4–]
was investigated by raising the pH with 0.1 M NaOH. Only modest adjustments
in the DH values were found (Table 1, entries 6–8),
further confirming the extensive electrostatic cross-linking present
in the samples.

Scheme 3 Loading of the PSxP2VPy (M) with (i) KAuCl4 and the Subsequent Photoreduction
(Top Pathway), or (ii) Loading with Borate-Capped Ag NPs (Bottom Pathway)
Suspensions of all PSxP2VPy (M)/AuCl4– were purified
by dialysis and subsequently studied using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)–Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The TGA data for the
unloaded microgels (solid traces in Figure 3b and the Supporting Information, Figure S1a–c) largely exhibit similar mass
loss profiles with a single dominant mass loss event at 420 °C
and other characteristics such as a temperature for 5% mass loss (TD5%) in the range of 360–380 °C
and a char mass at T = 775 °C (M775°C) of ∼0% for the PS20P2VP80 (M). The mass loss at 420 °C arises from a depolymerization
degradation mechanism for the PS and P2VP components in the random
copolymer network.66,67 The TGA of a AuCl4– compound has been previously published68 and exhibits a single mass loss event at 245
°C with a TD5% of ∼240 °C
and a M775°C of ∼35%. The
corresponding TGA data for the AuCl4–-loaded microgels are different and are a function of the nominal
P2VP weight content (Figures 3b and S1a–c). These PSxP2VPy (M)/AuCl4– materials exhibit a two-step mass-loss
profile with main degradation events at ∼260–280 and
400–405 °C. It is expected that as the microgel is enriched
in P2VP content that the capacity for loading KAuCl4 should
increase. As the nominal P2VP content in the microgel increases in
the series of samples, and consequently as the amount of AuCl4– increases, the mass loss associated with
the first degradation event increases. On the basis of the mass loss
data, and the close correspondence in the temperature of this event
to that of the native AuCl4– material,
we assign the first degradation event as a mass loss associated with
incorporated aurate ions. The second mass loss event would, therefore,
correspond to the depolymerization mechanism mentioned above. The M775°C of the AuCl4–-loaded microgels was also found to increase linearly with the nominal
P2VP weight content (see inset plot in Figure 3c). The inorganic content of the AuCl4–-loaded microgels is largely responsible
for mass at 775 °C.68 The inorganic
content of the AuCl4–-loaded microgels
is listed in Table 1 (entries 6–8). As the P2VP content is tuned from 40 to 80%,
the inorganic content increases from ∼20 to 43%. The high inorganic
content and the linear relationship in M775°C with P2VP weight content suggests that the electrostatic binding
of aurate into the network proceeds efficiently and utilizes most
P2VP+ sites in the microgel. Furthermore, the uniformity
in the trend also speaks to a highly uniform distribution of PS and
P2VP residues throughout the polymer network.

Microgel Au NP Composites
Prepared from AuCl4–-Loaded PSxP2VPy Microgels
The AuCl4–-loaded microgels were investigated
as precursors for the preparation
of Au NP-loaded PSxP2VPy microgels [termed PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs]. Previous investigations on
the chemical reduction of similar aurate-loaded P2VP-based microgels
using dimethylamineborane as a chemical reducing agent led to microgels
with only surface-loaded Au NPs.45 The
method of photoreduction of metal ion/polymer solutions takes advantage
of ligands coordinated to the metal cation for rapid reduction and
NP growth and is, therefore, a reduction method that is not limited
by the mass transport of a chemical reducing agent.69 Solutions of yellow AuCl4–-loaded microgels were exposed to 254 nm UV light and produced pink
to purple colored solutions, which is indicative of the formation
of Au NPs. A control sample of PS20P2VP80 (M)
was treated to the same UV exposure and showed similar characteristics
to that of the native microgel, confirming that the polymeric scaffold
is stable to the UV treatment (see Figure S1d; and later FTIR discussion). The recovered PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs were purified
by dialysis prior to characterization. The DLS studies revealed that
the DH,M values of PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs are similar or
smaller than the starting PSxP2VPy (M)/AuCl4– materials.
Both the PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs and the PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs contracted to 29 and 26% of
the original volume, respectively. The PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au NPs had a similar volume to the precursor microgel. We hypothesize
that the lower aurate loading and the lower pKa of the PS60P2VP40 (M) is responsible
for the different degree of volumetric change when compared to the
other two Au NP-loaded microgels. For PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs, the
decrease in DH,M is likely the result
of the reduction of Au ions to neutral Au(0). The presence of Au(0)
reduces ionic solvation and electrostatic repulsion forces previously
at play in the larger DH,M values found
for the aurate loaded precursors. Access to the equivalent latex state
[termed PSxP2VPy (L)/Au NPs] was attempted with a pH-adjustment using 0.1 M
NaOH. Similar to the parent aurate-loaded microgels, relatively small
changes in DH were found. A more detailed DH versus pH titration curve for PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs was performed and monitored by DLS,
which confirmed this observation (Figure S2a). Riedinger et al. have studied the volume change associated with
the latex-to-microgel transition for poly(2-vinylpyridine-co-divinylbenzene) polymer spheres loaded with Au NPs and
reported similar stability in DH.70 It was proposed that the NPs induced steric
hindrance in the spheres and led to stable diameter values in the
more rigid structure. The SEM investigations on PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs and PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au NPs
demonstrated that the shape of the Au NP composites were spherical
and indicated that the Au NPs were ∼7 nm in diameter (Figure S2b,c). The DN,L values for the solvent-free PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au
NPs and PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au NPs samples are also
reported in Table 1 (entries 10–11). Similarly, these DN,L values were smaller than any DH value for the Au NP-loaded particles, confirming solvent-based swelling
in the Au NP-loaded latex and microgel states.

The TGA mass
loss profile for PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs is shown
in Figure 3b (dotted
trace), and several differences are apparent when the data for the
PS20P2VP80 (M)/AuCl4– are compared to that for the parent PS20P2VP80 (M) (dashed and solid traces, respectively). Generally, all Au NP-loaded
microgels show a single mass loss event at ∼390–395
°C, which can be assigned to the depolymerization of the microgel
polymer network. In NP-loaded samples, the amount of mass loss due
to degradation of AuCl4– was negligible
(previously discussed mass loss event at ∼T = 250 °C), suggesting that the aurate ions have successfully
reduced into the more thermally stable Au(0) metallic state. The exposure
of 254 nm UV light to AuCl4– causes multiple
electron transfer steps from chloride ligands to the Au(III) center,
resulting in a reduction to Au(0) and the liberation of chloride ligands
as a byproduct.71,72 In all cases, the char mass of
the Au NP-loaded microgels, indicated herein by the M775°C, was found be less than that of the metal anion-loaded
precursor. The decrease in char mass can be attributed to the successful
reduction of AuCl4– ions to Au NPs and
the associated loss of Cl– ions. The TGA mass loss
profiles for PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs and PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au NPs are shown alongside that of
the PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs in Figure 3c for comparison. As the nominal
P2VP weight content increases, no significant differences in the TD5% were found, yet the M775°C increases linearly from 19 to 38% for the Au NP-loaded
microgels (see the inset in Figure 3c). The evidence for the loss of Cl– supports the assignment of the M775°C as mass derived primarily from Au NPs and hence inorganic-loading
entries 9–11 in Table 1 equate to the Au NP mass content of PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs samples. The increasing
linear trend in M775°C with increasing
P2VP content in the microgels (see the inset plot in Figure 3c) confirms that the P2VP content
specifies the ultimate Au NP loading in the PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs composites.

The size, location, and the Au-oxidation state of the Au NPs were
determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XPS. The
charge-corrected HRXPS plots for the 4f region for Au acquired for
PS20P2VP80 (M)/AuCl4– and selected PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs are shown in Figure 3d. For the aurate-loaded microgel, the plot reveals
two peaks for the 4f core electrons of Au with peak binding energy
values for the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks at 89.8
and 86.1 eV, respectively, and with a peak separation of 3.7 eV. These
values confirm that the Au in the ion-loaded microgels has an oxidation
state of (III).73 Corresponding plots for
PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs, PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs, and PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au
NPs reveal the peak binding energy values for the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks at 87.6 and 84.0 eV, respectively, with
a peak separation of 3.6 eV, all of which confirm that the Au in these
systems has an oxidation state of (0).74,75 The tomography
video (Movie S1) and TEM images (Figure S3a) identify Au NPs in the PS0P2VP100 (M)/Au NP sample. The TEM-estimated diameter for
the Au NPs is 7 nm, where ∼150 Au NPs are present in a PS0P2VP100 (M)/Au NP nanosphere. Frames from the 3D
tomography dataset have been extracted (Figure S3b) and used to determine that the Au NPs are located throughout
the P2VP microgel, not just on their surfaces as previously seen by
others.45

To probe at the nature
of the bonding associated with pyridinyl
groups in PSxP2VPy (M)/AuCl4– and PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs, TGA–FTIR
studies were conducted. The intensity maps from FTIR for temperature
versus wavenumber of the TGA–FTIR datasets are shown in Figure S4a–n. In comparing the data from
PS20P2VP80 (M), PS20P2VP80 (M)/AuCl4–, and PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs, all samples show evidence for a methyl-containing
volatile (νCH3 = 2973 cm–1) that is liberated with the onset and peak temperatures of 465 and
480 °C, respectively. Similarly, each sample evolves an ether-containing
volatile (detected with a νCO at 1136 cm–1; likely from the PEGMA stabilizer) with the onset and peak temperatures
of 450 and 475 °C, respectively. Volatiles associated with a
νaromatic CH at 3048–3111 cm–1 are liberated at similar onset and peak temperatures (∼445
and ∼480 °C, respectively) as well. The notable differences
in the TGA–FTIR studies are found for the vibrational ring-stretching
modes for phenyl and pyridinyl groups that are associated with evolved
gases from the samples. The intensity tracer plots from the FTIR data
relate the intensity of absorbance for the phenyl ring stretch of
PS (νbenz = 1635 cm–1) and the
pyridinyl ring stretch of P2VP (νpyr = 1585 cm–1); they are reported in Figures S4o and 3e, respectively. For the inert
conditions applied, the thermal degradation of PS and P2VP proceeds
by a depolymerization mechanism that evolves S and 2VP monomers at
temperatures of 436 °C.76 The signals
shown in Figures S4o and 3e can therefore be assigned to specific degradation products
for PS and P2VP, respectively. From the data in Figure 3e, the flux of pyridine-containing volatiles
from PS40P2VP60 (M) occurs with an onset and
peak temperature of 410 and 478 °C, respectively. This same flux
of pyridine-containing volatiles from PS40P2VP60 (M)/AuCl4– and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs occurs at lower temperatures (top two traces
in Figure 3e). For
PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs, the onset and peak temperature
(Tonset = 390 °C and Tpeak = 455 °C, respectively) were also ∼20
°C lower than the metal-free analogue. The profiles of the flux
of pyridine-containing volatiles from PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs and PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au NPs were
also the same as that for PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au
NPs (Figure 3f). A
control experiment where unloaded PS40P2VP60 (M) was treated to the photoreduction step (bottom trace in Figure 3e) indicates that
the chemical changes in the macromolecular network are likely trivial
and are not responsible for the decrease in temperature required to
volatilize pyridinyl compounds. The decreased thermal stability of
P2VP in the aurate- and the Au NP-loaded microgels suggests that there
is relatively weak bonding to these pyridinyl groups, which permit
a volatilization of the depolymerization products at a lower temperature.
However, it is possible that other kinetic factors are at play as
well. For example, it is possible that more efficient heat transfer
into the microgel network arises from an increase in the thermal conductivity
in the samples imparted by the presence of metallic species.77 The temperature required to volatilize degradation
products from PS, indicated by the signal associated with the phenyl
ring stretch, was also reduced by ∼20 °C (Figure S4o). The lack of significant bonding
interactions between pyridine rings, which would have otherwise increased
the temperature required to volatilize pyridine-containing molecules,
suggests that the surface of the Au NPs is only weakly bonded to the
microgel network and is, therefore, available for the binding of analytes
for SERS detection.

SERS from PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs
The high loading
of Au NPs in PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NP composites
and the relatively uncoordinated Au surface suggest that the samples
may be a candidate material for SERS detection. Figure S5a,b shows the SERS spectra acquired on solutions
of PS20P2VP80 (M)/Au NPs, PS40P2VP60 (M)/Au NPs, and PS60P2VP40 (M)/Au
NPs using 633 nm excitation. The data suggest that the Raman active
vibration modes in the microgel network cannot be excited and/or detected
under the conditions tested. Similarly, when the soluble and representative
CV analyte was introduced, the SERS spectra did not show any detectable
signals for this molecule. The high-resolution TEM data (Figure S3) indicated that the diameter of the
Au NPs in this system was ∼7 nm, and hence, their plasmon-excitation
absorbance, a requirement for the SERS technique, may be unlikely
with the excitation conditions used herein.78 We have further confirmed this by showing that free Au NPs are SERS
active for the detection of CV using our experimental conditions provided
that the Au NP diameter is greater than or equal to ∼30 nm
(Figure S5). While no SERS spectra were
acquired using PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs, it is possible that the composites would be excellent
SERS substrates, provided that a correctly matched plasmon excitation
source was employed or that a secondary growth step was used to enlarge
the Au NPs. The SERS-activity study that focuses on the application
of PSxP2VPy (M)/Au NPs is a topic of future work and is beyond the scope of
this current report.

Ag NP Microgel Composites from Loading Borate-Capped
Ag NPs
onto PSxP2VPy Microgels
The low-sensitivity SERS detection nanocomposites
from aurate-loaded microgels led us to consider larger, Ag-based NPs
that exhibit a red-shifted absorbance instead. The immobilization
of Ag NPs onto PSxP2VPy (M) was designed to utilize the cationic sites that are generated
at the protonated pyridinyl residues. Ligand-based pyridine–Ag
interactions that stabilize bound Ag NPs at the microgel are also
possible.79 Borate-capped Ag NPs were selected
because of their ease of synthesis, stability, and an inherent negative
surface charge.80Figure 4a shows the SEM image of the borate-capped
Ag NPs that were used in this work. The Ag NPs are roughly spherical
in shape and have a diameter of ∼55 nm, a value that agrees
with the DLS data (see the Experimental Section). As described above, the pH of the solution of PSxP2VPy (M) was adjusted below that
of the pKa. Introduction of a dilute solution
of borate-capped Ag NPs to a solution of PSxP2VPy (M) at pH = 1–2 resulted
in the self-assembly of the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NP composite. The PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NP composites
were purified by dialysis prior to characterization. The SEM images
in Figure 4b–d
depict the PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NPs, respectively. Inspection of these images confirmed that
the immobilization procedure led to a single nanostructure composite
in each case with neither free Ag NPs on the underlying SEM substrate
nor any unloaded PSxP2VPy (M). The SEM-estimated number of Ag NPs per PSxP2VPy (M) was determined
by averaging five different PSxP2VPy (M) in each corresponding SEM image (any
Ag NPs beneath the colloids are, therefore, omitted). The average
number of Ag NPs per PS0P2VP100 (M), PS20P2VP80 (M), and PS40P2VP60 (M) sphere was 29 ± 12, 15 ± 5 and 4 ± 3, respectively
(see inset in Figure 5b). On the basis of the diameter values for the Ag NPs and those
for the dried latexes, and ignoring any NP–NP overlap, the
Ag NP footprints are ∼17, 13, and 9% on the surface of their
polymer colloid substrates. This correlation confirms that adjusting
the S/2VP ratio at the synthetic stage is a means for controlling
the number of Ag NPs per microgel and, therefore, the surface density
of Ag NPs for SERS.

Further quantification of the
Ag content for the immobilization
of borate-capped Ag NPs on PSxP2VPy (L) was conducted using TGA. Figure 5a shows the overlaid mass loss
profiles for PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (L)/Ag NPs. Each dataset shows that the char plateau is less well-defined
relative to the parent and unloaded microgel analogues. Previous TGA
analyses on the related borate-loaded polymers attributed the more
gradual mass loss in the char region to a slow breakage of B–O
bonds for the mass loss.81 Nonetheless,
the M775°C metrics can still be extracted
from the plots for the Ag NP composites and used for further discussion.
The M775°C values for PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag
NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (L)/Ag NPs were 40, 25,
and 15%, respectively, and based on the near-zero M775°C values for the parent microgels can be assigned
as inorganic mass due to Ag. These data are also found in entries
12–14 in Table 1. Figure 5b shows
the plot for the M775°C versus the
nominal mass percent of P2VP. The increasing trend in Ag mass with
P2VP content correlates with conclusions based on the SEM where increased
Ag loading occurred as the P2VP content increased. On the basis of
the TGA-mass estimate for Ag, the spherical shape and diameter information
gleaned from SEM, and the bulk density of Ag,82 the number of Ag NPs per microgel sphere can be calculated using eq 1 1  where the mass of a single PSxP2VPy colloid (massPSxP2VPy)
was determined from the DN,L of the
PSxP2VPy (L)
and the weighted-average of the bulk density of PS and P2VP;83 the mass of a single Ag NP (massAg NPs) was determined using the SEM estimated diameter for the Ag NPs
and the bulk density for Ag. As such, the number of Ag NPs per microgel
sphere for PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NPs was found to be 26, 12, and 5, respectively (see the
inset in Figure 5b).
These values are in agreement with those determined by SEM particle-counting.
The controlled loading of Ag NPs onto sterically stabilized PSxP2VPy (M) offers
a potential advantage for tuned SERS activity. Contrary to the Au
NP-loaded samples, the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs analogues exhibit increased pH sensitivity
as characterized by DLS (Table 1, entries 12–14). The DH,M of the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NP samples are less than the values of their metal-free
parent microgels (Table 1, entries 1–3), possibly indicating a contraction due to bonding
to the Ag NPs. Interestingly, the DH,M and DH,L for the PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs subtly deviate from the expected trend of decreasing
values with decreasing P2VP content. It is possible that the PS content
in this system allows for a reduction in the number of contacts between
bound Ag NPs and allows for more flexibility in the polymer network,
thus favoring a subtly larger size than the PS0P2VP100 (L/M)/Ag NPs. This effect may be offset by energetic penalties
for PS-contacts with water that may dominate the PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NP sample. The volumetric swelling factors for the
series of samples, however, followed a similar and expected trend
to the parent microgels, where the values for PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs,
and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NPs, were 7.9, 3.3, and
1.8, respectively. The combination of the tuned Ag NP content and
the high pH-sensitivity in the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs series offer a unique experimental
landscape to maximize SERS properties such as sensitivity and stability.

The immobilization of SERS-active NPs onto a polymer structure
suggests that a Raman spectrum of that polymer substrate could be
acquired. Previous studies on the Raman spectrum of copolymers of
PS and P2VP have been reported.79,84 Solutions of dispersed
PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag
NPs were studied using a Raman spectrometer, and the baseline-corrected
633 nm excitation SERS spectra are presented in Figure 5c. The most prevalent peaks in PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NP spectra are found at (i) 1224, (ii)
1049, (iii) 1011, (iv) 751, and (v) 629 cm–1. These
correspond to modes relating to (i) the stretching of the C–C
bond between the pyridine ring and the P2VP backbone, (ii) a mode
for the in-plane C–H bending P2VP, (iii) a symmetric ring breathing
mode in P2VP, (iv) the B–O–B bending mode in the borate
anions, and (v) in-plane bending of the pyridine ring, respectively.84−86 The signal for the ring-breathing mode at 1011 cm–1 indicates a high content of coordinated pyridine at the silver surface
due to the adsorption through its nitrogen atoms.84 The confirmation of the Raman spectra from the PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs further supports the structure proposed
that is shown in Scheme 3. The SERS spectra for PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs
and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NPs are very similar in
composition to that of PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs.
The signal at 1049 cm–1 represents a composite C–H
bending signal for PS and P2VP. Notably, the signal for the ring-breathing
mode in P2VP shifts subtly to 1002 cm–1 once the
nominal P2VP is decreased to 60%. This suggests that there is less
N-coordinated-pyridine and more free pyridine sites in the P2VP in
this system. Figure 5d shows the plot for the intensity for the signal at 1011 cm–1 versus the nominal mass percent of P2VP in the microgel.
The exponential decrease in the signal with decreasing P2VP content
also reflects this diminished N-coordination. These data suggest that
by tailoring the P2VP content in this system, a balanced amount of
free P2VP results, which may favor improved acid-based swelling performance
in the Ag NP-containing composites.

To assess the potential
for PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs to act as substrates for SERS-based
detection, CV was used as a model analyte.87Figure 6a (entry
i) shows the 633 nm excitation Raman spectra for CV (1.1 × 10–5 M in water) acquired without a SERS method. Because
CV has electronic transitions at 633 nm, the observed CV spectra contain
an additional resonance Raman enhancement contribution. The spectrum
is consistent with previous literature studies88 and consists of five main peaks at (a) 795, (b) 905, (c)
1175, (d) 1385, and (e) 1620 cm–1, which correspond
to (i) out-of-plane phenyl C–H bending, (ii) ring-breathing,
(iii) asymmetric in-plane phenyl C–H bending, (iv) asymmetric
phenyl C–N stretching, and (v) asymmetric phenyl C–C
stretching modes for CV, respectively.89 Many of these signature peaks for the analyte do not overlap with
those for the PSxP2VPy (M) and, therefore, the background interference is minimal
(top most spectra in Figures 5c and S6 in for comparisons). Previous
SERS studies with CV under similar conditions concluded that the molecule
is normally bonded to the Ag surface by Coulombic and van der Waals
interactions.90,91 The Ag NPs used in the synthesis
of the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs are good substrates for SERS-based detection and as such,
the 633 nm excitation SERS spectra of 1 × 10–9 M Ag NPs with 1.1 × 10–8 M CV in water are
also included in Figure 6a (entry ii). Entries (iii–v) in Figure 6a represent the 633 nm excitation SERS spectra
for CV acquired for 1.1 × 10–8 M CV exposed
to 1 × 10–10 M PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NPs, respectively. After comparing
these spectra to that acquired using only Ag NPs (entry ii), it is
apparent that the Ag NP-loaded microgels function with a similar bonding
mode for CV but are more sensitive. Comparison of the intensity from
the spectra for the Ag NP-loaded microgels shows that the SERS intensity
increases with P2VP content. This increased intensity is presumably
due to the increased Ag NP loading that was correlated from TGA and
SEM investigations. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for the peak found
at 1620 cm–1 was used to further characterize the
correlation in intensity with P2VP content, where the S/N value for
this peak is plotted versus the nominal P2VP mass percent in the microgel
(Figure 6b). A linear
dependence of the S/N at 1620 cm–1 with P2VP content
was found. Under the conditions investigated herein, the linear trend
suggests that the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs are uniform in their sensitivity and
enhancement mechanism. AEFs were calculated using eq 2(87) where 2  ISERS and IRS are the intensity
of the 1620 cm–1 peak for the background-corrected
SERS spectra and the non-SERS
spectra of CV only, respectively. Parameters cSERS and cRS are the associated
concentrations of CV for each test. For free Ag NPs, the AEF value
was calculated to be 5.21 × 109. The AEF results are
outlined in Figure 6c for the three PSxP2VPy (L)/Ag NP nanocomposite systems (Table 2 also lists the calculated AEFs for the PSxP2VPy (L)/Ag
NPs). The highest AEF value was found for the PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs whose value of 1.11 × 1010 is
similar to other systems,87,92,93 but 2.1 fold higher than that found for the control sample containing
only Ag NPs (bottom entry in Table 2). As the P2VP content of the system decreased, the
AEF values decreased marginally, but remained higher than that of
the control sample containing only Ag NPs (Figure 6c). The AEF for the PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs was 1.08 × 1010, while that for
PS40P2VP60 (L)/Ag NPs was 7.08 × 109. Previous work for Au NP-decorated P2VP microgels reported
an enhancement factor of 1.3 × 106 for CV with an
excitation source of 532 nm.50 The high
AEF values reported herein are a consequence of the application of
the more SERS-sensitive Ag NPs, additional resonance Raman enhancement
at 633 nm excitation for CV, and the controlled loading of these NPs
onto well-defined copolymer microgels.

The demonstration of a successful transition of the
PSxP2VPy (M)
hybrids to
their latex-like state suggests that the sensitivity of the SERS-substrate
may be pH-tuned. Previous work on Au NPs immobilized on grafted P2VP
brushes correlated the pH-dependent SERS activity to the interparticle
spacing.94 The SERS-based spectra for CV
were therefore iteratively acquired using PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs, PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs, and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NPs upon shifting the pH of the
media from values of 7 to 2. We, therefore, define a pH cycle value
to track the performance of the SERS substrate. Integer values for
the pH cycle value represent the number of times that a PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NP sample
was cycled back to pH = 7 for the acquisition of the SERS spectra
of CV. Half-integer values of the pH cycle value represent intermediate
experiments where the SERS spectra of CV were acquired at the intermediate
condition of pH = 2. In all cases, the average intensity of the spectra
increased with an increase in pH. The S/N value for the asymmetric
phenyl C–C stretching modes at 1620 cm–1 was
used as a representative metric for this intensity change and is plotted
against the pH cycle number, n, (Figure 6d). During the period of n = 0–4, the PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag
NP system showed an overall evolution to a condition where the sets
of S/N values become more self-consistent for the high and low pH
conditions. After this 4 cycle break-in period, the S/N values alternate
between ∼35 and ∼20 for high and low pH, respectively.
Interestingly, the PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NP and
PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NP systems function with a
reduced break-in period (Figure 6d). The number of pH cycles required to stabilize the
S/N at 1620 cm–1 for the SERS spectra of CV for
PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NP and PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NP systems was 1.5 and 2.5, respectively. After break-in,
the S/N values for the SERS spectra of CV for PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs alternate between ∼77 and ∼30 for
high and low pH, respectively. The corresponding values for the PS40P2VP60 (M)/Ag NP system were 44 and 18, respectively.
The PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NP system, therefore,
appears to have the greatest sensitivity for pH-tuned SERS activity
and operates with the least amount of break-in.

The stability
of the intensity of the SERS spectra of CV was evaluated
using PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs and PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs. Spectra were acquired over a multiday
period with pH cycling on each day, and the value of the S/N for the
1620 cm–1 vibration mode is plotted versus time
and reported in Figure S7. When PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs were employed, the S/N for the
1620 cm–1 for CV dropped from ∼50 to an ultimate
value of 4 over three days. The corresponding CV SERS signal derived
from the PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs statistically
increased during the first 3 days (from 82 to 237) followed by a decline
to ultimate values within the range of 13 to 30 after 1 week. The
observation that the CV SERS signal derived from PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs is greater than that derived from PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs further emphasizes the importance of
the PS component in the microgel/latex. We hypothesize that the decline
in the CV SERS signal in the PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag
NP system is due to oxidation of the Ag NPs with ongoing exposure
to the ambient atmosphere. Confirming this and further stabilizing
the SERS active NPs by way of the addition of secondary metals and/or
refining the size and shape control of the NPs represents the subject
of current work in this area.

We hypothesize that the inclusion
of some PS into the structure
of the PSxP2VPy (M)/Ag NPs improves the pH-sensitive SERS performance by balancing
swellability with interfacial bonding strain. By reducing the number
of pyridine sites in the microgel, the swellability is reduced (Figure 2b) and the bonding
strain is reduced at the Ag NP–microgel interface during the
pH-triggered iterative expansion and contraction is reduced. If this
interfacial bonding strain is too high, the bonds to the Ag NPs break
and the SERS activity and pH-sensitivity will decrease because of
the loss of Ag NPs and an overall loss in the number of SERS-active
interparticle gaps. Figure S8 shows the
STEM images of the PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NPs and
PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs prior to any pH cycling
and after 3 pH cycles, respectively. It is clear that the number of
Ag NPs on the PS0P2VP100 (M)/Ag NP sample decreases
during the first 3 pH cycles, a finding that explains the decrease
in the intensity of the Raman spectra (i.e., the decrease in the S/N
at 1620 cm–1 in Figure 6d). The population of Ag NPs on the PS20P2VP80 (M)/Ag NPs after 3 pH cycles is similar
to that of uncycled analogue. This supports the theory that a composite
with balanced swellability and a high number of pyridine sites for
anchoring Ag NPs will exhibit improved pH-sensitive SERS performance.
To further confirm the relationship between the change in the SERS
signal and a related variation of the distance of the gap between
Ag NPs, a UV–vis study was also conducted. The UV–vis
spectra for PS0P2VP100 (M/L)/Ag NPs and PS20P2VP80 (M/L)/Ag NPs in Figures S9 and S10 were acquired over the course of the first three
pH cycles. In the initial microgel condition (spectra I), both materials
only show a broad plasmon absorbance band at ∼405 nm that is
derived from roughly spherical and nonagglomerated Ag NPs. Upon treatment
with acid, the latex condition (spectra II) evolved and included an
additional plasmon-coupled absorbance feature at ∼610 nm because
of a decreased distance between the Ag NPs for both the PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs and PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs. In both systems, the plasmon-coupled absorbance value
reversibly alternates in size as the two PSxP2VPy (M/L)/Ag NP samples are taken
through pH cycling until the final test with n =
3 (spectra VI). This strongly suggests that the alternating SERS signal
intensity reported in Figure 6d is related to the number and the size of the nanoscale gaps
between the Ag NP. Additionally, it is also apparent that the ultimate
plasmon-coupled absorbance for PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag
NPs is stronger than that found in PS0P2VP100 (L)/Ag NPs (spectra VI in Figures S9 and S10). This finding also confirms that the PS20P2VP80 (L)/Ag NPs are the more SERS-sensitive material after break-in.

Conclusions
A controlled methodology for the synthesis of
microgels with programmed
properties such as pH sensitivity, swellability, and capacity for
metal-loading is of great importance to many fields. In this work,
sterically stabilized and covalently cross-linked latexes based on
random copolymers of S and 2VP are synthesized. The latexes were found
to be monodisperse by DLS and by SEM and exhibited a pH-triggered
latex-to-microgel transition in the range of pH = 1.2–3.8,
a characteristic that is set by the S/2VP ratio that is defined at
the synthesis stage. The volumetric swelling factor was tuned from
2.5 to 140 with this ratio. The charged PSxP2VPy (M) was loaded with metal-containing
anions such as AuCl4–- and borate-capped
Ag NPs. Loading of PSxP2VPy microgels by DLS with KAuCl4 showed a
diameter reduction with increased binding where a loading limit of
∼0.3 molar equivalents of AuCl4– to pyridinyl groups was determined. The aurate-loaded PSxP2VPy (M) was converted
to Au NP-loaded PSxP2VPy (M) by photoreduction. Tomography by TEM showed that Au NPs
were located throughout the microgel structure. The loading of PSxP2VPy (M) with
borate-capped Ag NPs produced PSxP2VPy (M) with surface-located Ag NPs. The Ag
NP content of this nanocomposite was determined by the molecular ratio
of S/2VP corresponding to a range of ∼5–30 NPs per microgel
particle when the P2VP content ranged from 60 to 100%. The Ag NP-loaded
PSxP2VPy (M)
composites exhibited SERS activity for the macromolecular structure
in the microgel, as well as for the representative solution-phase
analyte, CV. A pH-responsive SERS activity for the Ag NP-loaded PSxP2VPy (M) was
found where the AEF for dissolved CV was tunable from ∼5.21
× 109 to 1.11 × 1010. The Ag NP-loaded
PSxP2VPy (M)
with ∼80 wt % P2VP exhibited the most stable pH response and
a high AEF of 1.08 × 1010.

Experimental Section
Materials
Styrene (S; 99% purity), 2VP (97% purity),
and 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA;
98% purity) were acquired from Acros Organics. PEGMA (average Mn = 2000, 50 wt % in H2O) and DVB
(55% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N-Methyl-N,N,N-trioctyloctan-1-ammonium
chloride (Aliquat 336) was used as received from Alfa Aesar. Potassium
tetrachloroaurate (KAuCl4), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate
(HAuCl4), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), silver
nitrate (AgNO3), and dry alumina oxide were obtained through
Fischer Scientific, Inc. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used as received
from Macron Fine Chemicals. Ultrapure water was produced using a Barnstead
Nanopure water purifier and had an overall resistivity of 18 MΩ·cm.
Regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing with a MWCO of 8000 or 12 000–14 000
were used as received from Fisher Scientific, Inc. The purification
of S, 2VP, and DVB was done under Schlenk conditions by passing each
monomer through dry alumina oxide powder to remove the polymerization
inhibitors. The purified monomers were used within 24 h, and if short-term
storage was required, they were sealed in round bottom flasks with
an inert atmosphere and stored in the dark at −18 °C.

Synthesis of PSxP2VPy Latexes
The preparation of latex particles
based on random copolymers of PS and P2VP (PSxP2VPy) follows a modified procedure
outlined by Dupin et al.46 The emulsion
polymerization was carried out in a 100 mL single-necked round-bottom
reaction flask. The PEGMA stabilizer (0.420 mL) and Aliquat 336 surfactant
(0.15 g) were both dissolved in ultrapure water (40.00 g) in the reaction
flask and sealed with a rubber septum. The reaction flask contents
were deaerated with 30 min of nitrogen bubbling or five freeze, pump,
thaw cycles. The flask, containing an inert atmosphere, was placed
in a hot oil bath, and the contents stirred at 500 rpm until the temperature
stabilized at 60 °C. The monomer mixture of 2VP (2.00–5.00
g), S (0.00–3.00 g) and DVB (0.03 g) was added to a scintillation
vial under inert atmosphere for a total targeted amount of 5.03 g.
The contents of the monomer vial were transferred to the reaction
flask using a syringe equipped with a filter (PTFE, 0.45 μm,
Millex). An emulsified condition was established by continual stirring
(500 rpm, 60 °C) for approximately 30 min. Deaerated, ultrapure
water (5.00 g) was used to pre-dissolve the AIBA initiator (0.050
g) in a separate scintillation vial with an inert atmosphere. Once
dissolved, the AIBA solution was rapidly delivered to the reaction
flask via a syringe to initiate the polymerization reaction. Stirring
continued for 24 h. Purification of the resulting latex was achieved
by centrifuging the crude latex for 15 min at 19 000 rpm in
high-density polycarbonate tubes (Thermo Scientific). After decanting
the supernatant liquid, an addition of ultrapure water was made to
bring the volume of the latex solution back to its original level.
Redispersion was carried out by sonication and/or stirring until the
solution appeared uniform. This centrifugation/decanting process was
repeated a minimum of three times. The final solution contained 8–9
wt % solids (with yields of 72–81%).

Preparation of Au NP-Loaded
PSxP2VPy Microgels
The procedure for the
preparation of Au ion-loaded colloids was adapted from Nakamura et
al.45 The pH of the PSxP2VPy (L) was adjusted to transform the latex into its microgel
state, (i.e., to pH = 2.5 for PS0P2VP100, PS20P2VP80, and PS40P2VP60,
and pH = 1.2 for PS60P2VP40) using 0.1 M HCl(aq). The PSxP2VPy (M) was further diluted with HCl(aq) (1:20) using
the appropriate HCl solution. The KAuCl4 was dissolved
in 0.0032 M HCl(aq) (i.e., pH = 2.5 for PS20P2VP80 and PS40P2VP60) and 0.063
M HCl(aq) (i.e., pH = 1.2 for PS60P2VP40) to make a 24 mM KAuCl4 solution. This pH-matched KAuCl4 solution was added slowly to the diluted PSxP2VPy (M) until the desired level
of ion-loading was achieved. In some cases, the loading was monitored
by DLS. The final solution was stirred for 30 min and purified by
dialysis with a MWCO of 8000 for 48 h. This afforded the ion-doped
colloidal microgels. The ion-doped microgels were subjected to photolysis
with stirring (500 rpm) for ∼18 h using a Rayonet model RPR-600
UV photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Inc.)
equipped with eight light sources, each with a 253.7 nm maximum emission
and a power of 8 W. The resulting Au NP-loaded PSxP2VPy (M) were purified by three
sequential 8 h dialysis steps using a MWCO of 12 000–14 000
membrane and fresh ultrapure water.

Synthesis of Borate-Capped
Ag NPs
The borate-capped
Ag NPs were synthesized according to modified procedures.80,95 The reducible Ag ion solution (5 mM) was prepared by dissolving
21.2 mg of AgNO3 in 25 mL of ultrapure water. This solution
was added to an ice bath-chilled 75 mL aqueous solution of NaBH4 (2 mM) and stirred for a minimum of 1 h. The reaction mixture
gradually turned yellow-green over the first hour. This solution was
aged in the dark for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to use. An average
diameter of 59.8 nm (polydispersity = 0.361) for a pH = 8 solution
of borate-capped Ag NPs was determined by DLS.

Complexation of PSxP2VPy Microgels
with Ag NPs
A 10 μL volume
of the purified PSxP2VPy (L) was diluted to a final volume of 10 mL with ultrapure
water. The latexes were converted to the microgel state as indicated
above. The borate-capped Ag NP solution was evaporated to half the
volume (3 mL) and then was added slowly to the stirred microgel solution.
The pH of the final solution was adjusted back to the starting value
with the addition of HCl(aq). The Ag NP-loaded PSxP2VPy microgels were
purified by three consecutive 8 h dialysis steps using a MWCO of 12 000–14 000
membrane and fresh ultrapure water.

Particle Size Characterization
by DLS
DLS measurements
were conducted using a DelsaNano HC instrument (Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
Fullerton, CA) equipped with a 658 nm laser diode. The photomultiplier
and aperture attenuator were set to collect scattered light at an
angle of 15° with a photon counting rate of ∼10 kcps.
Size measurements were conducted on ∼2–3 mL of the sample
in disposable PS cuvettes (4 mL capacity). The properties of pH-adjusted
solutions were assumed to be the same as water (n = 1.3329, η = 0.890 cP at 25 ± 1 °C). Samples (0.2
wt % solids) were filtered using 5 μm cellulose syringe filters
(Millex) and allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C for ∼5 min
before each measurement, followed by a 35–60 s acquisition
time (1 s per acquisition). The calculation of the particle size and
size distribution was performed using CONTIN particle size analysis
routines. The intensity distribution plots were averaged, and the
data are reported in Table 1 as the average hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of the particles. A DLS-monitored titration with 0.1 M HCl
was conducted on diluted PSxP2VPy colloids (original solution/ultrapure water = 1:20
v/v), with DLS size measurements occurring every 0.2 pH units after
1 min of equilibration.

Thermal Analysis
A TA Instruments
Q500 TGA instrument
equipped with an inline Thermo Scientific iS10 FTIR gas cell spectrometer
was used for both the TGA and TGA–FTIR experiments.96 To monitor the mass changes during thermal degradation
and to determine the NP-loading, TGA experiments were conducted with
a 15 min isotherm at 100 °C followed by a 20 °C/min ramp
from 100 to 800 °C. An isotherm before and after this temperature
program was held for 5 min to monitor the background signal of FTIR
spectra. The effluent from the sample was carried to the FTIR spectrometer
via an isothermal transfer line (225 °C) with dry nitrogen gas
flowing at 90 mL/min. The FTIR spectra (4 scans at 8 cm–1 resolution per spectra) were acquired at a 2.7 s interval for the
duration of the TGA and were corrected using a background dataset
created from a time averaged signal (5 min) from the blank nitrogen
carrier gas.

General Instrumentation
XPS data
were acquired using
a Kratos M-Probe instrument equipped with an Al Kα monochromatic
X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer (with an outer diameter
of 145 mm and an inner diameter of 88 mm). The analysis spot size
was 15.71 μm2 in area and the take-off angle was
55° with respect to the vertical direction of samples. The spectra
were fit using 30% Gaussian–Lorentzian components and a Shirley
background subtraction. All binding energies were corrected to the
C 1s peak for the background hydrocarbon component (C–C/C–Hx) at 284.9 eV.97 Electron tomography was conducted using a Talos F200X transmission
electron microscope. The tilted view inspections of the samples were
conducted with Inspect 3D software. SEM images were acquired using
either Vega TS 5136MM operated with an accelerating voltage of 15
kV or JEOL JSM-7200F/LV operated with an accelerating voltage of 30
kV. With an exception of the Ag NPs, samples for SEM analysis were
coated with a thin layer of Au and palladium (Pd) to dissipate charge
(nominal thickness ≈ 1 nm). Scanning TEM (STEM) images were
acquired with the JEOL JSM-7200F/LV instrument. Samples investigated
by STEM were applied to a lacey carbon copper grid (Ted Pella) and
not coated with charge dissipation materials prior to microscopy.
The UV–vis spectroscopy was performed with a JASCO V670 spectrophotometer.
The wavelength resolution was set to 1.0 nm and the scan speed was
400 nm/min. Absorbance was monitored for Ag-loaded PSxP2VPy solutions following
dialysis and a 1:50 v/v dilution with pH = 2.5 aqueous HCl. The UV–vis
spectra were acquired at each pH condition for a total of three pH
cycles. The pH was cycled with the addition of either 82 μL
of 3.0 M NaOH or 41 μL of 1.71 M HCl to 2.5 mL of the diluted
Ag-loaded PSxP2VPy. The UV–vis spectra were normalized to their peak maxima.

Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering
The SERS data were
acquired using a DeltaNu Advantage 200A spectrometer equipped with
a 633 nm helium–neon laser (5 mW). The spectral acquisition
time was 60 s. The system was calibrated using bulk PS and neat cyclohexane
as standards for the Raman frequency shifts (peaks for PS at 1001
and 621 cm–1; peaks for cyclohexane at 1444 and
1266 cm–1). All of the spectra were interpreted
after background correction to exclude interference due to fluorescence.98 Error bars correspond to the 95% confidence
interval for 4–5 replicates.
