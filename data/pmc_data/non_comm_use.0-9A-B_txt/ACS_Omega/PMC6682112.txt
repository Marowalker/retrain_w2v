We discuss here a solution-processed
thin film of antimony trisulphide
(Sb2S3; band gap ≈ 1.7 eV; electronic
configuration: ns2np0) for applications in planar
heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells. An alternative solution processing
method involving a single-metal organic precursor, viz., metal–butyldithiocarbamic
acid complex, is used to grow the thin films of Sb2S3. Because of excess sulphide in the metal complex, the formation
of any oxide is nearly retarded. Sb2S3 additionally
displays structural anisotropy with a ribbon-like structure along
the [001] direction. These ribbon-like structures, if optimally oriented
with respect to the electron transport layer (ETL)/glass substrate,
can be beneficial for light-harvesting and charge-transport properties.
A PHJ solar cell is fabricated comprising Sb2S3 as the light absorber and CdS as an ETL coated on to FTO. With varying
film sintering temperature and thickness, the typical ribbon-like
structures predominantly with planes hkl: l = 0 stacked horizontally along with respect to CdS/FTO
are obtained. The morphology of the films is observed to be a function
of the sintering temperature, with higher sintering temperatures yielding
compact and smooth films with large-sized grains. Maximum photon to
electricity efficiency of 2.38 is obtained for PHJ solar cells comprising
480 nm thick films of Sb2S3 sintered at 350
°C having a grain size of few micrometers (>5 μm). The
study convincingly shows that improper grain orientation, which may
lead to nonoptimal alignments of the intrinsic structure with regard
to the ETL/glass substrate, is not the sole parameter for determining
photovoltaics performance. Other solution-processing parameters can
still be suitably chosen to generate films with optimum morphology,
leading to high photon to electricity efficiency.

1 Introduction
Rapid
technological advancements in the 21st century has led to
a drastic rise in energy demand and consumption. To meet the growing
energy demands, harnessing energy from alternative renewable sources
has become increasingly important. It has been already forecasted
that mankind’s entire energy requirements will be met by technologies
harnessing energy derived from nonconventional renewable sources.
Photovoltaics (PV), which involves direct harness of energy of the
sun to electricity, is highly promising as it can provide abundant
clean energy at an affordable cost. Diverse materials ranging from
crystalline (including nanoparticles) to amorphous systems, small
organic molecules to polymers have shown great promise in conversion
of the solar photon to electricity.1−3 Polycrystalline silicon,
cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide, gallium
arsenide (GaAs), and gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) semiconductors
are some of the widely studied materials and few of these have made
their way in to practical solar cells.2 However, high processing and fabrication cost as in the case of
silicon, poor availability of rare earth elements such as indium and
gallium, and severity of environmental implication (e.g., toxicity
of Cd) pose a formidable hurdle toward large-scale deployment of solar
cells.4,5 Therefore, research has focussed on seeking
for alternative light-harvesting materials. In this context, low-cost
semiconductors like copper zinc tin sulfide, cuprous oxide (Cu2O), copper tin sulfide (Cu2SnS3), iron
sulfide (FeS2), zinc phosphide (Zn3P2), and cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) are promising light absorbers.6−10 However, undesirable implications due to copper defects, multiple
phase crystal structure, and low optical band gap are additional drawbacks
and pose formidable challenges toward maximization.11−13 Recently, organic–inorganic
hybrid methyl ammonium lead halide (MAPbX3) semiconductors
have attracted widespread attention because of achievement of record
breaking efficiency of photon to electricity conversion efficiencies.14,15 However, commercial applications of organic and inorganic hybrid
materials are presently limited because of drawbacks, for example,
chemical instability, phase transitions, and chemical compositions
comprising toxic elements.

To circumvent all of the above detrimental
features, sustained
efforts are necessary to develop stable ecofriendly and low-cost alternative
light absorbers. Binary metal sulphide semiconductor, antimony(III)
sulphide (Sb2S3), is an attractive light absorber
material because of its high chemical stability and is composed of
earth abundant elements. Moreover, antimony sulphide is relatively
less toxic compared to extensively studied Cd- and Pb-based sulphides
in the field of PV.5,16 Antimony sulphide has an optimal
indirect optical band gap of 1.7 eV and possesses high optical coefficient
(≈105 cm–1). This makes it an
ideal solar photon harvesting material.17,18 Reference (19) highlights that the ns2np0 class of semiconductors also posses large dielectric
constant, small charge carrier effective mass, antibonding states
placed under the valence band states, and high defect tolerance, which
are expectedly going to enhance the optoelectronic performances. We
expect that the antimony sulphide discussed here will also possess
similar beneficial properties. Unlike other conventional solar absorber
materials which possess the cubic crystal structure, orthorhombic
Sb2S3 is known to form infinite (Sb4S6)n ribbon-like structures
along the c-axis and very low dangling bonds at the
surfaces perpendicular to (001) plane.20 This exhibits the highly anisotropic charge transport properties
along the ribbon structure. The anisotropic nature of this material
provides unique challenges for fabrication of devices, and the performance
is inevitably linked to the orientation of the planes.21 This is reflected in the solar photon to electricity
conversion efficiencies where Sb2S3 has been
employed as a light absorber. In recent times, solar photon to electricity
conversion efficiency of 6.35 and 5% have been reported for mesoscopic
solar cells (with organic hole conductor) and Schottky-type planar
heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, respectively.21,22 Though mesoscopic cells show high efficiency compared to the PHJ
type, it has an additional hole conductor. Organic-based molecular
semiconductors are generally, unstable under ambient conditions and
cost intensive. Therefore, development of PHJ with a high photon to
electricity conversion efficiency is necessary to develop sustainable
technologies in the PV industry for long-time applications.

Rapid thermal annealing, thermal evaporation, and atomic layer
deposition are some of the processing techniques which have been used
to fabricate the Sb2S3 PHJ solar cell having
the efficiency 3.5, 1.27, and 5.77%, respectively.22−25 However, these methods involve
dedicated fabrication facilities with vacuum and high temperature
to form highly crystalline large-sized grains. Chemical bath deposition
is a low-temperature process. However, with this process, there is
always a possibility for the formation of Sb2O3 along with Sb2S3 thin films with small grains.26,27

We demonstrate an alternative metal–organic precursor
to
fabricate both CdS (electron transport layer ETL) and Sb2S3 (light absorber material) for PHJ solar cells. Compact
and uniform layers of ETL and light absorber have been achieved using
a low-cost metal–organic precursor (metal–butyldithiocarbamate)
and spin-coating technique at different sintering temperatures (275–350
°C). Because of the structural anisotropy in Sb2S3, which may have a detrimental effect on electronic transport,
the processing parameters influencing the crystallinity and thickness
are studied in detail to optimize the PV performance.

2 Results and Discussion
The reaction between butylamine and
carbon disulphide in ethanol/toluene
results in the formation of the butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA). BDCA
efficiently solubilizes most of the added metal oxide by forming a
metal–butyldithiocarbamate complex.28−30 The stable
metal carbamate complex is then cast on the CdS/FTO substrate and
heated at moderate temperature to convert it to the metal sulphide
in amorphous form. Further sintering at high temperatures leads to
pure crystalline (thin film) metal sulphides. The thickness of the
film is varied by varying the spin rate, and it will be discussed
in later section. The crystallinity and orientation of the Sb2S3 thin films are studied using X-ray diffraction
(XRD). Figure 1a shows
the XRD pattern of Sb2S3 films (sintered at
350 °C) on CdS-coated FTO glass along with the powder Sb2S3 sample. Based on the Scherrer formula, the crystallite
size of Sb2S3 thin film at 350 °C is approximately
56 nm. The XRD pattern of the powder Sb2S3 is
in good agreement with the standard pattern as per JCPDS no. 00-042-1393
(space group: Pbnm; a = 11.2390
Å; b = 11.3130 Å; c =
3.8411 Å and α = β = γ = 90°). This strongly
suggests that the powder form of Sb2S3 prepared
using the adopted method is in single phase with high crystallinity.
The XRD pattern of the thin film of Sb2S3/CdS/FTO
sample is observed to be different from that of the powder sample.
In general, the intensity of a few planes is lower for the thin film
sample compared to the powder sample. This is attributed to the oriented
growth on the substrate (vide infra). Bulk crystals of antimony chalcogenides
(sulphide, selenide) consist of strongly (chemically) bonded 1-D ribbons
of [Sb4S6]n units
along the [001] direction as shown in Figure 1b–d. However, in the [100] and [010]
directions, the ribbon structures are held together by weak van der
Waals forces.31 The intrinsic morphology
of Sb2S3 in the thin film changes significantly
by varying the sintering temperature (250–400, 280–350,
500–550 °C).22,32,33 In some cases, the orientation of the thin film depends on the nature
of the substrate. For instance, the bare glass and CdS-coated FTO
substrates grow preferentially displaying, respectively, (hkl): l ≠ 0 and (hkl): l = 0 planes in the diffraction pattern.32 From the XRD pattern of the Sb2S3 on CdS/FTO substrate (Figure 2a), it is observed that intensity of (hk0) planes (020), (120), (130) is higher in comparison to (hkl) planes (211), (221).

Figure 1 (a) XRD pattern of Sb2S3 in powder form,
thin film of Sb2S3 on CdS/FTO glass. The pattern
in red shows the reference pattern (JCPDS no. 00-042-1393). (b) Unit
cell of Sb2S3 while viewing along the c-axis, (c) single unit of [Sb4S6]n and (d) the ribbon structure of Sb2S3 viewing along the a-axis (red sphere:
Sb, yellow sphere: S).

For preferential orientation growth, texture coefficient
(TC) of Sb2S3 thin
film
samples at various sintering temperatures are calculated and displayed
in Figure 2b by using
the following equation: , where parameters I, Io, and n are the measured diffraction
peak intensity, diffraction peak intensity of reference pattern, and
total number of selected diffraction peaks taken in the calculation.
Larger TC value for particular diffraction
peaks indicates the preferred orientation along the particular plane
of the thin film. From the texture coefficient (TC) values, the (hk0) planes were higher
than (hkl) planes. This confirms that in general,
the (hk0) planes are highly textured in the Sb2S3 thin films formed from the metal organic single-source
precursors and growth is oriented at [hk0]. While
increasing the sintering temperature from the 275 to 350 °C,
the TC values remain higher for (hk0) planes than those of the (hkl) planes
as shown in Figure 2b. From this, we conclude that the orientation of the thin film growth
is not affected by the sintering temperature. Figure 2c depicts the (hk0) plane
orientation of Sb2S3 thin film on the CdS/FTO
glass substrate.

film at different temperatures. (c) Schematic presentation of horizontal
packing of [Sb4S6]n ribbon structure on the CdS/FTO substrate while viewing along the c-axis. Rectangle strips represent the planes [green: (020),
red: (120), blue: (130)].

Trap and surface states in the semiconductor are generated
by the
covalent bond breaking (dangling bond) at the surfaces.34−37 The 1-D ribbon structure Sb2S3 has the advantage
that there are no dangling bonds along the (hk0)
plane surfaces.38 Absence of dangling bonds
and hence the defects are manifested via high intensity of diffraction
peaks from (hk0) crystal planes. This will expectedly
lead to lower charge trapping in the optoelectronic devices. In general,
the (hk0) oriented growth of antimony chalcogenide
semiconductors shows a decrease in photon to electron conversion efficiency
because of significant increase in the series resistance.38 We anticipate here that the optimally thick
crystalline Sb2S3 films will bypass this problem
and expectedly enhance the efficiency in PHJ solar cells. As shown
in Figure S1, the TC values of the Sb2S3 films of varying
thickness (at constant temperature) also follow the same trend with
the (hkl): l = 0 planes showing
higher value compared to (hkl): l ≠ 0. Therefore, there is no texture difference observed at
the Sb2S3 morphology by varying the film thickness.
Thus, it is important to note that a highly crystalline film with
an optimum thickness is an important parameter for the development
of high-efficiency PHJ solar cells. From the observation of the cross-sectional
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Figure S4), the thickness of the Sb2S3 layer is found to be 270, 360, 480, and 630 nm for
spinning speeds at 5000, 4000, 3000, and 2000 rpm, respectively, at
sintering temperature of 350 °C.

Figure 3 shows the
optical absorbance spectrum of Sb2S3 films of
varying thickness grown on the CdS/FTO substrate along with the amorphous
Sb2S3 film formed prior to the sintering process.
The CdS (Eg = 2.5 eV) thin film on FTO
glass absorbs slightly in the visible light region,39 compared to other wide band gap metal oxide (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, SnO2) ETLs used in optoelectronic devices.40 Additional absorption of light by CdS along
with Sb2S3 would be beneficial as this effectively
increases the absorption of the visible light. The amorphous Sb2S3 on CdS starts to absorb light at around 570
nm. Once the film is sintered above the 275 °C, Sb2S3 becomes crystalline in nature and the visible light
absorption region increases and extends up to the IR region and exhibits
an indirect band gap of 1.7 eV (estimated using Tauc plot, Figure 3b). From Figure 3a we can conclude
that when the thickness of the light absorber Sb2S3 increases by decreasing spinning speed from 5000 to 2000
rpm, the optical absorption range in the visible wavelength region
gradually increases. There are no notable changes in the absorption
spectrum of Sb2S3 because of different sintering
temperature processes.

Figure 3 (a) UV–visible light absorbance spectrum of Sb2S3 at different spin rates and final sintering
temperature
of 350 °C. UV–visible spectrum of the films sintered at
200 °C (amorphous) is also shown in the same plot and (b) Tau
plots to measure the indirect band gap.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and FESEM are used to characterize
the roughness and morphology of the Sb2S3 layer
on the CdS/FTO glass surface. In Figure S2, FESEM images of CdS-coated FTO glass show the uniform coverage
of CdS (layer thickness ≈ 120 nm) on the rough FTO surface.
The root mean square (rms) roughness of CdS on FTO glass is around
5.15 nm, which has a lower rms value compared to the bare FTO glass
of 29.2 nm (Figure S3). Generally, the
morphology of the absorber layer in PHJ depends on the sintering temperature
and nature of the substrate used in the devices. In this study, growth
of Sb2S3 layers at various temperatures has
been done by keeping the CdS layer on FTO constant. At 4000 rpm, the
deposited Sb2S3 on CdS/FTO is annealed for a
few minutes at 200 °C followed by sintering at various temperature
(275 to 350) °C for 15 min. The rms value of Sb2S3 on CdS/FTO is around 27 nm for the 275 °C sintered sample,
as shown in the Figure 4e–h. At 300 °C, the roughness decreased to 18 nm. With
further increase in the sintering temperature, the roughness decreased
to 11 nm (at 325 °C) and 8 nm at 350 °C along with gradual
increase in the size of grains (Figure 4e–h).

(d) 350 °C. All SEM images are having a scale of 1 μm.

(h) 350 °C.

At 275 °C, the particles
in the Sb2S3 film are agglomerated. The agglomerates
are separated by large amounts
of voids. With the increase in temperature, the particles start to
grow in size, leading to the elimination of the voids. This is observed
in the SEM images of Sb2S3 on CdS/FTO shown
in Figure 4a–d.
At 300 °C, the calculated average crystal size is nearly 54 nm
as obtained by Scherrer equation and agglomerated grain size is >2
μm with some remnant voids, as observed from the FESEM. At 350
°C sintering temperature, the film shows a glassy texture with
an average agglomerate grain size larger than 5 μm with nearly
no visible voids on the surface. This ensures that the roughness at
the surface is low and this will decrease the short circuit contact
between the CdS ETL and gold counter electrode. The larger grain size
with high crystallinity will enhance the recombination resistance,
leading to better PV performances.41 The
elemental ratio between S and Sb are obtained using EDS measurements,
and the values are shown in the Table S1. No drastic changes are observed in the roughness of Sb2S3 films of varying thicknesses (at constant sintering
temperature).

Because of multiple valence states present in
the Sb-based compounds,
it is necessary to examine using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) the oxidation states of the various elements constituting Sb2S3. The high-resolution core spectrum of the individual
elements is fitted with Lorentzian to estimate the binding energy
and oxidation states of Sb and S as shown in the Figure 5a,b.

Figure 5 High-resolution core
level XPS of Sb 3d3/2 (a), S 2p
(b). Experimental data are shown in red circle, and solid lines represent
the fitted values.

The binding energy of
Sb+3 oxidation state consists
of two main peaks because of spin orbital coupling in the Sb 3d orbitals.42 In general, the surface adsorbed oxygen 1s peak
at around 530 eV, which overlaps with the Sb 3d5/2 peak
in the range 529–530 eV.21,42−44 Therefore, Sb 3d3/2 is only considered for the analysis
of the oxidation state of Sb. From the Figure 5a, 538.8 eV pertains to the Sb trivalent
state. The Sb–O peak at around 540 eV is observed to be insignificant. Figure 5b shows the core
spectrum of S. The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 stated differently
is 1.2 eV which confirms the minus two oxidation states present in
the Sb2S3 layer. No extra peak is observed at
around 168 eV, which refers to the S in the oxidized form. For Sb2S3 prepared using other solution based protocols,21 additional sulfurization processes are required
to remove oxide layers from the Sb2S3 layer.
However, in the case of the present metal organic precursor protocol,
a nearly oxide-free Sb2S3 layer is formed without
the necessity of any postsintering processes. This is primarily due
to the in situ formation of the BDCA complex in the solution which
is rich in the sulphide group hindering the formation of the oxide
layer.

In general, specific device parameters are affected because
of
elemental loss, microstructural changes, crystal phase, and orientation
of growth of the light absorber. The characteristic current density
versus voltage behavior of the solar cells under 100 mW cm–2 illumination is shown in Figure 6. The specific parameters of the devices are summarized
in Table 1. The power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of Sb2S3 PHJ incorporated
with ETL (CdS) sintered at 275, 300, 325, and 350 °C temperatures
is obtained as 0.78, 1.28, 1.50, and 1.70% respectively.

versus voltage curve of the best performance Sb2S3/CdS PHJ solar cell fabricated at various sintering
temperatures.

Table 1 PV Parameters
of Solar Cells Fabricated
with Sb2S3 Films Sintered at Various Temperatures
sintering
temperature (°C)	VOC (V)	JSC (mA cm–2)	FF	PCE (%)	RSh (Ω cm2)	RS (Ω cm2)	
275	0.42	5.23	0.35	0.78	162.8	41.7	
300	0.52	6.68	0.37	1.28	195.4	41.5	
325	0.52	7.40	0.39	1.50	197.2	30.8	
350	0.52	8.44	0.38	1.70	233.0	34.3	
When the sintering temperature increased from 275
to 300 °C,
the corresponding open circuit voltage (VOC) increased from 0.42 to 0.52 V, and it reached a stable value of
0.52 V at 325 and 350 °C. As discussed earlier, the change in
sintering temperature of Sb2S3 affects the microstructure
with the crystal structure remaining constant. The lower value of VOC for the device having Sb2S3 sintered at 275 °C compared to the other devices is
attributed to the large amounts of voids present in the Sb2S3 light absorber layer which leads to pin hole formation.
High degree of roughness (rms = 27 nm estimated from AFM) and pin
hole formation in Sb2S3 materials leads to considerable
amount of recombination at the CdS buffer layer interface. At elevated
temperatures (325 and 350 °C), the VOC becomes constant because of the lower roughness and larger grain
size. On the other hand, the JSC value
increased from 5.24 at 275 °C to 6.68, 7.40, 8.44 mA cm–2 for 275, 300, 325, and 350 °C, respectively. This can probably
be attributed to the reduction in the void volume fraction with increase
in temperature. The grains increase in size effectively, leading to
percolative charge transport.

The increase in temperature also
leads to dense packing of the
layer along with lower rms values. Though the obtained crystal orientation
in the films may not present the best situation for electron transport
from the light absorber to the CdS ETL (and hole transport to the
metal contact), the well-developed grains along with lower roughness
of the film still enhance the efficiency of the PHJ solar cells. The
energy is generally dissipated via the two resistance parameters viz.
series (RS) and shunt resistance (RSh). For ideal rectification, the shunt series
should be maximum and series resistance should be minimum in value.45−47 Based on the linear approximation method,48 the two resistances are calculated from respective device I–V plots as shown in Table 1. The solar cell with PCE 1.70%
shows a high shunt resistance of 233 Ω cm2. With
the increasing annealing temperatures, the RSh increases because of improved film microstructure and high
packing density. This decreases the recombination of the photogenerated
charge carriers at the CdS interface. With regard to RS, the higher the sintering temperature, the lower is
the RS value. The device fabricated at
275 °C recorded the highest value (≈41.7 S cm2); the lowest value is obtained at 325 °C (≈30.8 S cm–2). Better connectivity between the grains results
in decrease in the RS value.49,50 The RS increased from 30.8 S cm2 at 325 °C to 34.3 S cm2 at 350 °C. This
is attributed to large grains obtained at 350 °C as observed
from SEM. We propose that because of optimum roughness of the Sb2S3 film at 325 °C, the gold layer fused better
with the light absorber, thus forming a better contact with the former.
The better contact with Sb2S3 leads to lower RS values at 325 °C. The Sb2S3 surface is smooth (low rms value) for the films sintered
at 350 °C. This leads to some degree of physical mismatch of
the gold with the Sb2S3 film sintered at 350
°C, thus leading to the higher contact resistance. Based on the
above discussion, we can easily conclude that the 350 °C is optimum
temperature for high efficient device fabrication, and the average
PV device parameters are obtained at 350 °C and displayed in Table S2.

The morphology and optical density
of light absorber materials
play an important role in the performance of PHJ solar cell.51−53 In this context, the performance of PHJ solar cells with the Sb2S3 film sintered at 350 °C and with varying
thickness (obtained via varying the spinning speed) are studied. The
current density versus voltage plots are shown in Figure 7. The best efficiency is obtained
for the device with Sb2S3 thickness of around
480 nm, exhibiting an efficiency of 2.38% (VOC = 520 mV, JSC = 9.52 mA/cm2, FF = 48%), and the average device parameters (480 nm thickness
device) are shown Table S2. The optical
absorbance density, pin hole formation, and charge carrier transport
is strongly influenced by the thickness of the light absorber.54 The VOC value shows
a drastic change from the 0.46 to 0.52 V when the thickness increases
from 270 to 360 nm. The VOC became nearly
constant for the films with thickness of 480 and 630 nm. This can
be accounted on the basis of very high possibility of pin hole formation
in the PHJ solar cell. When the light absorber material is thinner
than the optimized film thickness, higher recombination will take
place between the metal contact and ETL.55 This proposition is supported by the estimated RSh values, where the thinner film shows a lower shunt
resistance (151.5 Ω cm2) value compared to the thicker
film as shown in Table 2. The value of the fill factor for the films of varying thickness
shows a trend similar to the VOC.

rates [5000 rpm: 270 nm, 4000 rpm: 360 nm, 3000 rpm: 480 nm, and 2000
rpm: 630 nm].

The JSC values as a function of the
film thickness are shown in Table 2. JSC of 8.93 and 9.52
mA cm–2 are obtained for 630 and 480 nm, respectively.
For the 360 and 260 nm thick films, the JSC values are, respectively, 8.83 and 7.00 mA cm–2. The changes in JSC can be accounted
on the basis of the combined effects of optical density and charge
carrier transport properties in the Sb2S3 layer.
The UV–visible light absorbance spectra in Figure 3 support the proposition of
the increase in the optical density with increasing thickness of Sb2S3 in the devices. This shows that to obtain high
optical density and photocurrent, an optimal film thickness, desired
diffusion path length, and crystal orientation is absolutely essential.
In case of Sb2S3, the reported diffusion lengths
vary from (290 to 900) nm depending on the light intensity.56 In this study, film thickness of 480 nm provides
the optimal condition for solar cell operation. The effect of film
thickness is reflected in the shunt and series resistances as well,
as shown in the Table 2. Under the conditions presented here the optimal values of RS (17.4 Ω cm2) and RSH (431.6 Ω cm2) are obtained
for the film of thickness 480 nm.

3 Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated here fabrication of highly crystalline,
plane-oriented growth of Sb2S3 with controlled
morphology starting from a metal–organic precursor. We believe
that this work will pave the way for the development of metal sulphides
from simple alternative synthesis protocols, such as single-source
precursor solution methods to fabricate to PHJ solar cells. By understanding the crystal orientation growth
in films obtained from single-source method will provide feasible
ways to fabricate other 1-D, 2-D based light absorbers for optoelectronic
devices. Our studies convincingly show that sintering temperature
and thickness are essential parameters for the final film morphology
and crystal orientation which eventually have a significant effect
on the solar cell performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Metal Organic Precursors
Toluene (5
mL) and of 1-butylamine (C4H9–NH2) (3 mL) are taken in a 25 mL glass vial. This is kept inside
an ice bath. To the above mixture, 1.5 mL of carbon disulphide (CS2) solution is added slowly dropwise under gentle stirring.
The solution changes from colorless to slightly yellow. This confirms
the formation of BDCA. Following this, 1 mmol of antimony(III) oxide
is added to the BDCA solution. The mixture is heated at 70 °C
for 30 min until the metal oxide is completely dissolved, and the
solution turns dark yellow. This solution is further heated to remove
unreacted butylamine and CS2. After removal of unreacted
chemicals, the solution becomes highly viscous. The viscosity of this
solution typically depends on the added metal oxide concentration.
Trace amounts of insoluble metal oxide particles are removed by centrifugation
(speed: 8000≈ rpm) and stored in a closed glass vial at room
temperature for further use. The CdS precursor solution is also prepared
by the protocol as discussed above. Instead of toluene, ethanol is
used as the solvent. This resulted in better adhesive films on the
fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (Sigma-Aldrich FTO glass—sheet
resistance—8 Ω/sq, thickness ≈ 550 nm) substrate
compared to when films are cast using toluene.

4.2 Device
Fabrication
Before deposition
of the CdS ETL, the FTO glass substrate is cleaned with detergent,
acetone, and ethanol in a sequential way and dried by blowing N2 gas. CdS metal organic precursor was added dropwise on to
clean FTO glass, which is rotated at a speed of 6000 rpm for 60 s.
The CdS/FTO is then baked on the hot plate at around 200 °C for
2 min, followed by sintering at 450 °C under an inert atmosphere
for 15 min. The Sb2S3 absorber layer of varying
thickness is deposited at various spinning speeds viz. at 2000, 3000,
4000, and 5000 rpm. Following this, the sample is annealed at 200
°C for 2 min in a hot plate to remove the organic byproducts.
This is followed by sintering the Sb2S3 at 275,
300, 325, and 350 °C to convert the amorphous metal sulphide
(orange color) to crystalline Sb2S3 thin films.
Following the sintering process, the film is cooled down to room temperature
under the same inert atmosphere to avoid the formation of metal oxide
layer on the surface. Finally, the gold counter electrode is deposited
by a sputtering unit (JEOL JFC-1100E ion sputtering device) for 15
min at an applied current of 15 mA under vacuum. The active area of
each solar cell device is kept nearly constant at approximately 0.04
cm2 (0.2 × 0.2 cm).

4.3 Characterization
The powder XRD pattern
of thin film Sb2S3 is recorded using the PANalytical
Empyrean X-ray diffractometer; Cu Kα radiation, 1.5418 Å
with a nickel filter source operating at 45 kV with 30 mA at a step
size and scan speed of 0.026° min–1 and 0.033°
s–1, respectively. The powder form of the metal
sulphide is collected from the thin film. UV–visible spectrum
of Sb2S3 coated on to the CdS/FTO glass is recorded
using solid-state Shimadzu MPC3600 equipped with an integrating sphere
for the UV–visible data. Surface morphology and thickness of
each layer in the solar cell is examined using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Ultra55 FESEM Karl Zeiss) with the help of inlens detector
and secondary electron detector facility, respectively. The oxidation
states of the elements present in the thin film are obtained using
XPS. The XPS data are recorded with AXIS-Ultra using monochromatic
Al Kα radiation (225 W, 15 mA, 15 kV). The Sb2S3 sample is scratched out from the FTO glass substrate for
the XPS analysis. A Keithley source meter unit (model 2400) is used
to perform the current versus voltage (I–V) characterization under a simulated 1.5 AM solar irradiation
with the power of 100 mW/cm2. Sciencetech 300 AAA solar
simulator (xenon source) is used to generate radiation, and power
of the lamp is calibrated using monocrystalline silicon reference
cell from NREL. All I–V measurements
are carried out in room with controlled atmosphere (humidity >
70%
at room temperature).
