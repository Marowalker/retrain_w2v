We would like to correct a figure
shown in our original paper. On page 3385 of the original paper, in Figure 3, the units are mg/mL.
The correct units are μg/mL, and the revised Figure 3 is plotted here. This erratum
does not affect any of the results or conclusions described in the
text. We apologize for the mistake.

Figure 3 Kinetic cell adhesion curves recorded
by Epic BT. The plotted lines
represent the averaged values of the three parallel experiments. For
obtaining these data, the cells were preincubated with solutions having
different EGCG concentrations. After, these treated cells were pipetted
into the biosensor wells and cell adhesion was monitored for 2 h.
It is clearly seen that increasing the EGCG concentration decreases
the sigmoidal character of the kinetic curves. For the highest EGCG
concentrations, the sigmoidal character is completely missing and
adsorption-like curves are recorded.
