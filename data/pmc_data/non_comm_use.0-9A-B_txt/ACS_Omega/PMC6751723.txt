Gold
nanostructures absorb visible light and show localized surface
plasmon resonance bands in the visible region. Semiconducting ZnO
nanostructures are excellent for ultraviolet detection, thanks to
their wide band gap, large free exciton binding energy, and high electron
mobility. Therefore, the coupling of gold and ZnO nanostructures represents
the best-suited way to boost photodetection. With the above perspective,
we report on the high photocatalytic activity of some Au_ZnO core–shell
nanoparticles (NPs) recently prepared by a one-pot synthesis in which
a [zinc citrate]− complex acted as the ZnO precursor,
a reducing agent for Au3+, and a capping anion for the
obtained Au NPs. The overall nanostructures proved to be Au(111) NPs
surrounded by a thin layer of [zinc citrate]− that
evolved to Au_ZnO core–shell nanostructures. Worthy of note,
with this photocatalyst, sun light efficiently decomposes a standard
methylene blue solution according to ISO 10678:2010. We rationalized
photodetection, reaction rate, and quantum efficiency.

Introduction
The
need for clean water is fundamental to humanity. Typical wastewater
management (filtration, chlorination, desalination, reverse osmosis,
etc.) suffers from severe limitations because of the ineffective decontamination
and/or elevated related costs. In this context, the peculiar properties
of some new nanostructures may overcome these issues and promote unconventional
water purification methods.

From this perspective, the ZnO-based
photocatalyst has attracted
great attention because of the low cost of ZnO and its excellent stability,
abundance, and photoactivity. The main disadvantage of ZnO is its
wide band gap that makes it promising for ultraviolet (UV) detection
but less efficient for sun-driven applications. In fact, ZnO is a
semiconductor with a wide band gap (3.37 eV), a large free exciton
binding energy (60 meV), and a high electron mobility (∼400
cm2 V–1 s–1).1,2

However, noble-metal–ZnO composite nanostructures may
overcome
this problem as noble-metal nanoparticles (NPs) absorb visible light
and generate localized surface plasmon resonances suitable to enhance
photodetection of visible light.3 Therefore,
the conjugation of gold NPs and the wide band gap ZnO semiconductor
is one of the most suitable ways to improve ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) photodetection.4−6

In this context, there have
been many reports concerning the photocatalytic
activity of Au on ZnO materials, useful in many different technological
fields.7−22

Conversely, a few studies of Au_ZnO having a core–shell
structure (ZnO shell on Au NPs core) have been reported. Between them,
the optical properties of ZnO shell grown on Ag and Au nanoparticle
cores by a solution method have been investigated.23 It was found that both ZnO/Ag and ZnO/Au show strongly
enhanced near-band-edge UV exciton emission from the ZnO shells because
of coupling with surface plasmon resonance of the metal NPs. These
observations suggested the suitability of metal NPs for improving
optical detection.

In another study, Au/ZnO core–shell
NPs with different shell
thicknesses were obtained by chemically depositing zinc oxide on gold
NP surfaces.24 A significant effect on
the photoluminescence intensity and shortening of the decay time of
the rhodamine 6G dye in the presence of Au/ZnO core–shell NPs
was observed. The current–voltage curve of hybrid Au/ZnO exhibited
a rectifying nature and represented the n-type Schottky diode behavior
with a typical turn-on voltage between 0.6 and 1.3 V. It was also
found that the rectifying ratio increases with decreasing thickness
of the ZnO shell, whereas the electrical transport through the core–shell
was similar to what was observed for pure ZnO sample NPs. Also, the
nature of the O vacancy in graphitic-like ZnO bilayer films supported
on Cu, Ag, and Au(111) surfaces was studied by quantum mechanical
calculations.25 Furthermore, hybrid semiconductor
plasmonic nanostructures of zinc oxide on gold NPs were synthesized
by the addition of ZnO quantum dots to a suspension of Au NPs of different
sizes and so forth.26

Recently, we
obtained some core–shell Au_ZnO NPs by reacting
zinc citrate Zn3(C6H5O7)2·2H2O and HAuCl4·3H2O in a one-pot synthesis in which the [zinc citrate]− complex acted as the ZnO precursor, a reducing agent for Au3+, and a capping anion for the obtained Au NPs.6 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements provided evidence of Au(111) NPs
with a mean radius of about 5 nm, surrounded by ∼2 nm layer
of [zinc citrate]− that evolved in Au_Zn(OH)2 and then in Au_ZnO.

Therefore, in the present investigation,
we report on the photocatalytic
activity of the above-mentioned Au_ZnO core–shell NPs, prepared
by a one-pot synthesis, toward a standard methylene blue (MB) solution,
according to ISO 10678:2010. Worthy of note, sun light was used as
the irradiation source, and we observed a fast and efficient MB decomposition.
Finally, we accurately calculated the number of adsorbed photons,
the reaction rate, and the quantum efficiency.

Results and Discussion
Semiconductor photocatalysts are a class of emerging nanomaterials
that show many applications comprising the degradation of toxic pollutants.
When the photocatalytic semiconductor is exposed to photons having
energy equal to or higher than its band gap, the generated electron–hole
pairs can react with atmospheric oxygen and produce highly reactive
oxygen species suitable to promote oxidation processes for the degradation
of many organic compounds. The coupling of surface plasmon resonance
of Au NPs with the exciton emission in the ZnO shells induces enhanced
absorption. With this aim, Au NPs (core) capped with ZnO (shell) were
prepared in a single-step (one-pot) synthesis and characterized, and
their photocatalytic behavior was exploited.6

XPS
Results
The electronic study of the Au_ZnO nanostructure
is fundamental to investigate the Au–ZnO electron interactions,
which are the basis of the coupling of the plasmon Au resonance with
the ZnO exciton emission, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
represents the most suited tool to accomplish this task.27,28Figure 1a shows the
XPS spectrum of Au_ZnO in the Au 4f–Zn 3p binding energy region.
A careful deconvolution of this experimental profile reveals that
the Au 4f7/2,5/2 spin–orbit components lie at 83.8
and 87.6 eV (3.8 eV spin–orbit coupling), thus indicating the
presence of Au0 states, usually expected at 84.0 eV (4f7/2).29 The Zn 3p spin–orbit
components lie at 88.9 and 91.9 eV with a 3.0 eV spin–orbit
coupling. These 3p levels are a couple of tens of eV at higher binding
energy with respect to those previously reported for ZnO.30

°C,
in the Au 4f–Zn 3p binding energy region. The black line refers
to the experimental profile. The blue line represents the background;
the magenta line refers to the Au 4f spin–orbit components;
the green line refers to the Zn 3p spin–orbit components; the
red line superimposed on the experimental profile refers to the sum
of the Gaussian components. (b) Al Kα excited XPS of Au_ZnO,
dried at 130 °C, in the Zn 2p binding energy region.

Figure 1b
shows
the XPS of Au_ZnO in the Zn 2p binding energy region. The 2p3/2,1/2 spin–orbit components have been observed at
1023.7 and 1046.7 eV, respectively. These values are about 2 eV at
higher energy with respect to typical values observed for pure ZnO
materials31−33 but almost identical to those previously reported
for some Au–ZnO architectures.34 This observation strongly confirms the electronic communication
between ZnO and Au in a way that ZnO electrons are supplied to Au.

Finally, the XPS atomic concentration analysis revealed an Au/Zn
percentage of 0.6, roughly corresponding to half of the nominal Au
concentration. This result is acceptable since XPS probes only the
surface of the Au_ZnO material whose composition is 98.5% in Zn.

TEM Measurements
TEM/scanning (STEM) microscopy (Figures 2, S1) shows the presence of NPs having a mean radius of about
5–10 nm. In addition, we noted that the Au NPs are oriented
toward the (111) plane with the measured interplanar distance of 2.36
Å (Figure 2, right).
EDX analyses clearly demonstrated that the experimental composition
of the Au_ZnO nanostructures is identical to the nominal 1.5% of Au
in ZnO (Figure S2).

Au, and the surrounding shell represents the Zn complex; right: high-angle
annular dark field-STEM at atomic resolution showing a representative
Au NP highly oriented toward the (111) plane with an interplanar distance

XRD Measurements
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
were performed on both ZnO and core–shell Au_ZnO samples. The
obtained patterns, shown in Figure 3, have multiple contributions that have been attributed
to different phases. The Au NPs provide clear and intense 111, 200,
and 220 reflections of the face-centered cubic lattice with Fm3̅m symmetry (PDF 00-04-0784).
Besides the gold contributions, the two patterns share common phases
mostly ascribed to orthorhombic (PDF 00-020-1435) and tetragonal (PDF-00-38–0356)
sweetite structures with stoichiometry Zn(OH)2. The additional
reflections 100, 002, and 102 (space group P63mc, COD ID 00-101-1258) and 101 and 110 (space
group P63mc, PDF 01-075-1533)
belong to the ZnO hexagonal zincite structure.

(black line) and core–shell Au_ZnO
(red line). The 100, 002, 102, 101, and 110 reflections belong to
the ZnO hexagonal zincite structure. The 220 reflection belongs to
the orthorhombic Zn(OH)2 sweetite structure (indicated
with the symbol O), whereas the 224, 215, and 314 reflections belongs
to the tetragonal (indicated with the symbol T) Zn(OH)2 sweetite structure.

Optical Measurements
UV–vis experiments were
performed by suspending 0.2 mg of ZnO or Au_ZnO in 3 mL of water.
A small magnet was used to stir these solutions that remained clear
during UV–vis measurements. The absorbance spectra (Figure 4) show a stronger
absorption for the Au_ZnO system with respect to the ZnO counterpart
in the whole 200–900 nm range, and this is certainly due to
the additional presence in the spectrum of Au_ZnO of the surface plasmon
of the Au NPs. In fact, it is well known that the surface plasmon
of Au NPs appears as a broad band peaked in the 500–600 nm
wavelength region depending on their size and shape.35−42 Thus, the absorption of the solution containing Au_ZnO is also due
to the presence of the Au NP plasmon resonance, thus confirming that
the coupling of Au NPs with ZnO enhanced the UV–vis photodetection.

absorption spectra of the water solutions obtained
by suspending 0.2 mg of ZnO (black line) or Au_ZnO (red line) in 3
mL of water. These solutions have been stirred during UV–vis
measurements. Inset: expanded scale of the UV–vis Au_ZnO absorption
spectrum.

Photocatalytic Experiments
Starting UV–vis spectra
of the two aqueous solutions, each containing 3 mL of 1.44 ×
10–5 M MB and 0.2 mg of ZnO or Au_ZnO powders, significantly
differ in the wavelength region below 600 nm, since in the spectrum
of the solution containing Au_ZnO, there is the presence of the Au
NP plasmon resonance hidden under the MB absorbance band.

For
both MB solutions, we observed an evident and monotonic absorbance
decrease, consistent with the decomposition/decoloration of the dye
(Figure 5a,b) upon
irradiation. This evidence confirms the ability of both our oxides
to act as efficient photocatalysts for water decontamination. A careful
inspection of Figure 5a,b also indicates that Au_ZnO is more effective than ZnO, and this
behavior is well evident in Figure 5c. In fact, Figure 5c shows that the MB concentration decreases as a function
of the irradiation time for all samples with a first-order kinetic
law. The curves were fitted in the range between 0 and 6 h with the
following decreasing exponential formula: ln C/C0 = −kt, where k is the discoloration rate constant. The values of the
discoloration rate obtained by using sun light are 0.566 and 0.712
h–1 (±0.01) for the MB solution in the presence
of pure ZnO and core–shell Au_ZnO, respectively, with an increase
of 26% in the latter case. These results are in agreement with the
best, already reported, similar data for ZnO catalysts.43

from absorbance measured at 662.2 nm (band maximum) for 1.44 ×
10–5 M water solutions of MB exposed to solar light.
Black and red lines are related to the MB with pure ZnO and Au_ZnO,
respectively. In both cases, the fit goodness was 99%.

The procedure to measure the efficiencies of MB decoloration
for
ZnO and Au_ZnO samples is described in the following. We started from
the tabulated solar irradiance (Figure S3): the maximum sun irradiation is 1.32 W/m2/nm at 522
nm, and ∼0.86 W/m2/nm is observed at both 400 and
800 nm visible limits. Integrating in the 300–2500 nm wavelength
range, the solar intensity is calculated to be 830 W/m2 (less than 1 kW/m2). Nevertheless, during our discoloration
experiments, we measured an integrated irradiance of 70 mW/cm2 = 700 W/m2, about 84% of the total tabulated sun
irradiance (integrated over 300–2500 nm). In order to calculate
the solar spectrum hitting the sample during our experiment, we rescaled
the tabulated spectra, taking into account the effective measured
intensity. Dividing this solar spectral irradiation by the photon
energy at each wavelength and taking into account the exposed surface
of the cuvette, we are able to calculate the number of photons/m2·nm·s (N) hitting our cuvette. The number of photons
adsorbed (Nass) by the oxides is calculated
by using the formula Nass = N·(1 – 10–absorbance), where the absorbance
spectra are reported in Figure 4 (absorbance of ZnO or Au_ZnO). The number of absorbed photons/m2·nm·s is showed in Figure 6 at each wavelength.

Figure 6 Calculated absorbed solar
photons for ZnO (black line) and Au_ZnO
(red line) catalysts.

According to the absorbance
spectra reported in Figure 4 and in agreement with our
expectation, Au_ZnO (pale gray) absorbs an order of magnitude more
photons than ZnO (white) itself. The total number of photons/m2·nm·s between 300 and 2500 nm is calculated by integrating
the curves showed in Figure 6 and are reported in Figure S4.
The quartz cuvette contained 3 mL of 1.44 × 10–5 M (2.60 × 1016 MB molecules) water solutions of
MB, and only one side of it was exposed to sunlight so that the total
exposed surface was 3 cm2. Therefore, after 4 h of solar
irradiation (14 400 s), 9.9 × 1019 and 5.7
× 1020 photons are absorbed by each solution, containing
ZnO or Au_ZnO, respectively. By using the data of Figure 5a,b, after 4 h, 2.34 ×
1016 and 2.45 × 1016 MB molecules were
decomposed by ZnO and Au_ZnO, respectively. By dividing each of these
values by the appropriate number of absorbed photons (2.34 ×
1016/9.9 × 1019 × 100 = 0.024% and
2.45 × 1016/5.7 × 1020 × 100
= 0.0043%), we got the quantum efficiency values for the two catalysts
(0.024% for ZnO and 0.0043% for Au_ZnO). Therefore, it is evident
that Au_ZnO, with respect to ZnO itself, shows an order of magnitude
increased absorption (5.7 × 1020), 26% increased discoloration
rate (0.712 h–1), and nevertheless lower quantum
efficiency (0.0043%).

Concerning the MB photodegradation mechanism,
the irradiation of
a semiconductor moves electrons from the valence to conduction band.
The excited electrons and the resulting holes have strong reductive
and oxidative powers, respectively, and produce reactive oxygen species.
In this context, it has already been reported that the energy edges
of valence and conduction bands of semiconductors determine the type
of generated reactive oxygen species.21 Thus, in ZnO, holes react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals,
and electrons react with dissolved oxygen to yield superoxide anions.
Moreover, superoxide anions can react with holes to form singlet oxygen
during irradiation of ZnO/Au NPs. The reaction of MB with these reactive
oxygen species results in N-demethylation of its
auxochromic dimethylamine groups plus water and carbon dioxide.

In general, photoactivity is a rather complex behavior that involves
several steps: (i) generation of the electron–hole pairs (related
to photon absorption), (ii) separation and diffusion of the charge
carriers to the active surface sites, (iii) reaction of holes with
defects or with the MB on the surface-solution interphase, and (iv)
electron scavenging. Therefore, the observed different quantum efficiencies
could be due to the different lifetimes of the electron–hole
pairs generated by the photons impinging on the two ZnO and Au_ZnO
catalysts. The inset reported in Figure 4 shows the expanded scale of the absorbance
spectrum of Au_ZnO and clearly indicates a small but significant feature
at about 300 nm, consistent with the presence of states in the band
gap, absent in the present ZnO system.

It is important to mention
that our present study does not really
allow to recognize the nature of compensating defects as cation vacancies,
interstitial oxygen, or more complex defect clusters.44 Nevertheless, it has already been reported that some defect
states associated with the presence of zinc hydroxide Zn(OH)2 layers on the surface of ZnO nanocrystallites should enhance the
photocatalytic activity, and by XRD measurements, we revealed some
Zn(OH)2 in the Au_ZnO core–shell NPs.45,46

In addition, we cannot exclude the role of other defects at
the
grain boundaries as partially responsible for the lower quantum efficiency
found using the present Au_ZnO catalyst. In fact, it could also be
possible due to the presence of a few Au3+ ions as dopants
that substitute for Zn2+ in the zincite ZnO structure.
In this case, the extra electron provided by Au3+ could
go in the 4s–4p hybrid empty conduction band or, more likely,
form a localized state deep in the band gap, as it seems evident in
the inset of Figure 4. These states could be traps for the electrons of the electron–hole
pair and be responsible for the decreased quantum efficiency of the
Au_ZnO catalyst.

Conclusions
In the present study,
the UV–vis photodetection of ZnO was
enhanced by about 1 order of magnitude by obtaining Au_ZnO core–shell
nanostructures, prepared by a one-pot synthesis in which the [zinc
citrate]− complex acted as the ZnO precursor, a
reducing agent for Au3+, and a capping anion for the obtained
Au(111) NPs. An increased absorption was observed in Au_ZnO because
of the additional presence of the surface plasmon resonance of the
Au NPs. As already reported for similar systems, electronic interactions
between gold and n-type semiconductor ZnO at their interfaces allows
the generation of superoxide species.15 In fact, using this Au_ZnO photocatalyst, sun light efficiently
decomposes a standard MB solution, according to ISO 10678:2010, with
a better photocatalytic activity (increased of 26%) than that observed
using ZnO, even though the decomposition rate did not increase by
an order of magnitude because of the lower quantum efficiency observed
for the Au_ZnO system.

Experimental Details
Synthesis of Au_ZnO Core–Shell
NPs
The synthesis
of Au NPs capped with ZnO NPs was performed as previously reported.6 In particular, an appropriate quantity of zinc
citrate Zn3(C6H5O7)2·2H2O [hereafter Zn3(Cit)2] was introduced into a three-necked flask and kept in the refrigerator
at 5 °C. After 1 day, the mixture was totally clear (zinc citrate
is more soluble in cold water than in warm water), and the measured
pH was 6.50. Then, we brought this solution on a heating plate and
slowly added aliquots of a HAuCl4·3H2O
solution in order to have a final 1.5% Au3+ concentration
in Zn2+. Then, the solution was left to cool, thus leaving
Au NPs as a consequence of the reducing power of the [ZnCit]− complex.6 Afterward, we dropwise added
conc. NH3 to obtain a white gel of Au_Zn(OH)2 at pH = 8.9. Finally, the overall gel was dialyzed with deionized
water, left to evaporate up to a few mL, and dried at 130 °C.
A similar synthetic procedure was used to synthesize ZnO without any
addition of HAuCl4·3H2O. In the present
study, we are dealing with ZnO and Au_ZnO dried at 130 °C since
the photocatalytic behavior of the materials obtained at this temperature
is better than that observed for the same materials sintered at higher
temperatures (up to 1000 °C). At this temperature (130 °C),
we observed the presence of some hydrated ZnO (vide infra), but for
convenience, we will refer to ZnO throughout the paper.

TEM Measurements
TEM measurements were performed by
means of a JEOL ARM200F atomic resolution analytical microscope. A
Cu/C TEM grid represented the sample holder. A 60 K eV electron beam
was used for STEM and EDX analyses.

X-ray Photoelectron Data
XPS spectra were collected
with a PHI 5600 instrument (base pressure of the main chamber 3 ×
10–8 Pa) using the Al Kα X-ray radiation and
a pass energy of 5.85 eV.27,28 Under these conditions,
the instrumental energy resolution was better than 0.5 eV. Al Kα
X-ray satellite structures were subtracted before to process the data.
A Shirley background was removed from the XPS peaks. The main C 1s
peak at 285.0 eV was used to calibrate the spectra.27 XPS was performed on samples dried at 130 °C. The
instrumental atomic sensitivity factors were used to get the atomic
concentration analysis. The fitting of the Au 4f–Zn 3p spectrum
was performed with symmetrical Gaussian envelopes.

XRD Analysis
XRD data were obtained with a D8 Discover
Bruker AXS diffractometer (Cu Kα source) equipped with soller
silts and operating in 2θ–Ω geometry. The patterns
were acquired with a 0.01° step size and a step time of 10 s/step.
The powder compounds were pelletized between tungsten carbide dies
at 500 kg/cm and then loaded on the sample holder.

UV–Vis
Spectra
UV–vis data were obtained
using a UV–vis V-650 Jasco spectrometer at 0.2 nm resolution
at room temperature.

pH was measured with a standardized Metrohm
E 654 glass microelectrode (pH uncertainty = ± 0.01).

Photocatalytic
Behavior
Photocatalysis experiments
were performed using two quartz cuvettes, each containing 3 mL of
1.44 × 10–5 M MB aqueous solution, in which
we added 0.2 mg of ZnO or Au_ZnO powders. The cuvettes were covered
with lids to preclude solvent evaporation during the experiment and
left in the dark for 60 min to permit the adsorption of the dye on
the oxides to reach equilibrium. The measured pH of both solutions
was 7.6. UV–vis spectra before and after being in the dark
for 60 min were identical. Then, we added a small magnetic stir bar
in each solution, placed them on a magnetic stirrer, and left them
covered with lids under the sun light for up to 300 min. The solar
irradiation, measured using a Thorlabs power meter was 70 mW/cm2. Initially, the cuvette solutions were subjected to fast
UV–vis absorbance measurements after cycles of 10 min irradiation.
After 90 min of sun light irradiation, UV–vis measurements
were performed every 30 min.
