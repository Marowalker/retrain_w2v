Voltage fade significantly
hinders the practical use of Li-rich
Mn-based layered oxides (LLOs) as cathode materials for next-generation
high-energy-density Li-ion batteries. Therefore, an in-depth understanding
of the factors influencing the LLO voltage fade during cycling is
fundamentally important for tailoring the structure and thus improving
the electrochemical performance of the corresponding electrodes. Herein,
we compare the electrochemical performances of LLOs with different
particle size and conduct in situ high-pressure response measurements
to determine the effects of particle size on voltage fade, demonstrating
that small particles can undergo a reversible layer-to-spinel phase
transition that results in improved voltage stability during cycling.
The above finding provides a novel paradigm for the development of
high-capacity LLO electrodes and thus contributes to the establishment
of a more energy-efficient and green society.

Introduction
The high reversible specific capacity,
low cost, environmental
friendliness, and facile processing of Li-rich layered oxides (LLOs),
which exhibit a layered structure similar to that of other conventional
layered transition metal oxides, make them promising cathode materials
for next-generation high-energy-density batteries.1−4 Despite the ongoing debate on
whether LLOs form intermixed nanodomains of separate LiMO2 (M = Ni, Co) and Li2MnO3 phases or are homogeneous
solid solutions featuring a Li2MnO3 superlattice,
the abnormally high capacities of LLOs are thought to be related to
the activation of the LiMn6 ordering component5−7 involving redox reactions of transition metal cations and the oxygen
anions.8−10 The reversible formation of O2n– peroxo-like species is expected to be accompanied
by a massive migration of transition metal cations to Li-depleted
layers, inducing a layered-to-spinel phase transition and hence resulting
in voltage fade.11−14 To overcome this problem, many studies have been performed to understand
the process of Li insertion/desertion and optimize the electrochemical
behavior of electrode materials.15−19 Voltage fade can be mitigated in a number of ways,
including the use of new electrolytes and binders,20,21 coatings,22−25 doping,26−30 and optimized synthesis conditions.31−34 However, the mechanism of voltage
fade suppression is still not fully clear because of the variability
of the utilized compositions, morphologies, and electrochemical parameters.
Thus, the intrinsic relationship between material structure and voltage
fade-governing properties must still be deeply understood from different
angles.

Li-ion insertion/desertion during prolonged charge/discharge
results
in the formation of local stress points in the corresponding intercalation
compounds,35 and the concentration of such
stress may result in strain.36 For example,
the shear stress associated with layered Li intercalation compounds
results in plane gliding and induces the migration of transition metal
ions during cycling.37,38 Material cracking is observed
when the stress exceeds the yield strength, resulting in significant
electrode performance deterioration.39 However,
to the best our knowledge, previous studies investigating the mechanical
behavior of electrode materials mostly focused on purely physical
calculations,40 whereas only few reports
dealt with the mechanical behavior of as-prepared cathode materials
to understand voltage fade in LLOs.

The high-pressure stability
and bulk compressibility of a given
material are directly related to its response to stress during charge/discharge.14 Herein, the mechanical properties of electrode
materials were analyzed using a high-pressure method that allowed
the modulation of the Li-ion-extraction/insertion-induced stress to
avoid the interference of other factors and more precisely characterize
the intrinsic performance of these materials. Previous works revealed
that Co- and Mn-based Li-rich materials suffer from more serious voltage
fade and capacity decline than other Li-rich materials.41 During Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation,
coarser-grained electrode materials are expected to be exposed to
a larger stress than finer-grained ones because a larger amount of
Li is removed in the former case. Herein, we prepared coarse- and
fine-grained Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2 as a model Li-rich layered oxide and characterized sample
structure evolution by high-pressure in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD),
exploring the effect of particle size on voltage fade during cycling.
Therefore, the insights into the voltage fade mechanism described
herein are expected to serve as a guide for high-capacity cathode
material optimization.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of B- and
S-LLO, demonstrating that both materials contained nonagglomerated
particles with uniform size (∼500 and 100 nm, respectively),
good dispersion, and smooth surface.

Figure 1 SEM images of B-LLO (a) and S-LLO (b).

Figure 2 shows that
the XRD patterns of B-LLO and S-LLO were almost identical, exhibiting
well-defined peaks indicative of a highly crystalline nature and thus
suggesting that the corresponding lattice parameters were also similar.
The main diffraction peaks were assigned to a NaFeO2-type
layered structure of an R3̅m space group, whereas the minor peaks at 20–25° were
attributed to the LiMn6 ordering reflection.42 The (003)/(104) intensity ratio was approximately
equal to 1.2, and (006)/(102) and (018)/(110) adjacent peak separations
could be clearly observed, which indicated that both samples featured
well-developed layered structures. Rietveld refinements performed
in the R3̅m space group without
including the superlattice peak region (20–25°) showed
that the obtained lattice parameters of B-LLO and S-LLO (a = 2.8261 Å and c = 14.1453 Å; a = 2.8263 Å and c = 14.1458 Å,
respectively) were almost identical within the range of allowable
error. This finding indicated that the overall compositions of both
samples were very close, as confirmed by the results of inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometers analysis, which allowed the composition
of these samples to be identified as Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of B-LLO and S-LLO. The *
peak is assigned to the
attribution of binder poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE).

The surface compositions and structure of B-LLO
and S-LLO were
elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 3) analysis, which demonstrated
that the two samples featured identical spectra comprising a Mn4+ 2p3/2 peak at ∼642 eV and a Co3+ 2p3/2 peak at ∼780 eV. Because XPS is a surface-sensitive
analysis technique, the above finding implied that B-LLO and S-LLO
exhibited identical surface states.

for S-LLO and B-LLO.

Subsequently, the electrochemical performances of the above
materials
were investigated in a voltage range of 2.0–4.8 V at a current
density of 300 mA g–1 (Figure 4). Figure 4a,d shows cycle number-dependent specific discharge
capacities for each sample, revealing that B-LLO and S-LLO could deliver
reversible capacities of 190 and 210 mAh g–1, respectively,
i.e., the fine-grained sample outperformed the coarse-grained one. Figure 4b,e shows the cell
voltage as a function of specific capacity after normalization. After
50 cycles, the average discharge potential dropped from 3.28 to 3.14
V in the case of B-LLO, corresponding to a 0.14 V voltage fade and
being in agreement with a previous report,11 whereas a much smaller voltage fade of only 0.08 V was observed
for S-LLO. Figure 4c,f shows differential capacity as a function of cell voltage for
cycles 10–50, revealing that for B-LLO, the discharge peak
area decreased between 3.45 and 4.35 V but increased in the low-voltage
region of 2.45–3.05 V. Thus, the relative contribution of low-voltage
capacity to the total capacity and the voltage fade increased with
increasing number of cycles, which was previously ascribed to the
conversion to a spinel-like phase.13 In
contrast, the voltage fade was much smaller for S-LLO, which indicated
that the use of fine-grained materials could enhance the stability
of the layered Li-rich oxide phase and achieve a more stable average
discharge voltage.

cycles performed

mA g–1. (b, e) Voltage profiles of the 1st, 10th,
20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th cycles for S-LLO and B-LLO, respectively.

Figure 5 shows
the
XRD patterns of B-LLO and S-LLO subjected to 100 cycles. The * peak
is assigned to the attribution of binder PTFE. Significant peak broadening
was observed for B-LLO, which was ascribed to an increased structural
strain, whereas the disappearance of the (006) peak and the merging
of adjacent (018) and (110) peaks suggested that the sample underwent
a conversion to a spinel-like phase.43 This
conversion was expected to result in voltage fade and capacity decline,
in agreement with the results of electrochemical testing. In contrast,
no significant differences were observed between the XRD patterns
of S-LLO recorded before and after 100 cycles, which demonstrated
the superior structural stability of the latter sample upon cycling
but was not consistent with the results of Dahn et al.44 In the present work, the particle size refers
to the size of a primary particle and the primary particle shows a
good dispersion.

mA g–1.

To gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of particle size
influence
on the evolution of structure and voltage fade during cycling, we
evaluated the high-pressure stability of Li[Li0.2Co0.4Mn0.4]O2 because the high-pressure
stability and compression response of host materials are directly
related to the response of solids to stress. Moreover, because the
magnitude of voltage fade is closely related to the degree of delithiation14 and increases with the increasing amount of
Li accessed upon charging, two lithiation states were characterized,
namely, fully and half-lithiated ones.

Figure 6 shows the
integrated in situ synchrotron XRD patterns of fully lithiated B-LLO
recorded at different pressures. The pattern obtained at ambient pressure
corresponded to a highly crystalline material with a NaFeO2-type layered structure of the R3̅m space group. As the pressure was increased from 2.47 to
35.7 GPa, the (003) peak of fully lithiated B-LLO monotonically shifted
to higher diffraction angles, concomitantly losing the intensity and
becoming broader (Figure 6a). Interestingly, the above peak retained its symmetry throughout
the process. At pressures above 37.39 GPa, all of the diffraction
peaks disappeared, indicating the occurrence of a pressure-induced
disorder. After decompression to ambient pressure, the sample remained
amorphous (Figure 6b), which was indicative of a totally irreversible structure destruction.

Figure 6 (a) In
situ high-pressure XRD patterns of fully lithiated B-LLO
and (b) expansion of region A showing the (003) peak.

Figure 7 shows the
XRD pattern evolution of the half-lithiated B-LLO, demonstrating that
the (003) reflection also exhibited a shift to higher angles, broadening,
and intensity loss with increasing pressure. However, in this case,
the above peak was markedly asymmetric. Upon further compression to
47.73 GPa followed by the release to 11.81 GPa and then to ambient
pressure, the above peak recovered its original lattice position but
remained asymmetric, in stark contrast to the behavior of the fully
lithiated sample, which turned amorphous. This asymmetric peak was
fitted by TOPSWARE, which revealed the emergence of a shoulder peak
to the right of the main (003) peak (Figure 8). The appearance of this new peak agreed
well with a previous report,45 wherein
it was attributed the layered-to-spinel phase conversion responsible
for voltage fading.

B-LLO
and (b) expansion of region A showing the (003) peak.

Figure 8 (a) Fit of the (003) peak observed after decompression
to ambient
pressure and (b) graph showing fitting residues.

Figure 9a
shows
that the structural evolution of the fully lithiated S-LLO with increasing
pressure was similar to that observed for the fully lithiated B-LLO,
but much slower, e.g., the former sample remained crystalline at ∼30
GPa. Similar behavior was also observed for the half-lithiated S-LLO
(Figure 10a), which
indicated that S-LLO was more stable than B-LLO. Importantly, for
the fully lithiated S-LLO, no new peaks were observed to the right
of the (003) peak at 0–30 GPa, and the above peak maintained
its symmetry when pressure was released, which indicated that the
high-pressure structure of the fully lithiated S-LLO could be reversibly
transformed into the initial structure (Figure 9b). At pressures of 10 and 20 GPa, which
were applied to mimic the stress during shallow charging, no new peaks
were observed. For the half-lithiated S-LLO, a new peak to the right
of the (003) peak emerged when pressure was increased to 47.73 GPa.
After decompression, this new peak disappeared, and the (003) peak
regained its symmetry (Figure 10b), i.e., for half-lithiated S-LLO, the high-pressure
structure could be reversibly converted to the initial structure.
Therefore, the results of in situ high-pressure XRD analysis demonstrated
that the fine-grained sample had a greater ability to bear stress
than the coarse-grained one at the same lithiation state, and the
migration of transition metal ions occurred reversibly in the grains
of the former sample.

S-LLO

Conclusions
Herein, we observed
unusual mechanical responses of Li-rich layered
oxides (Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2) in different lithiation states. Specifically, S-LLO maintained
its layered structure upon compression to 40.32 GPa, whereas B-LLO
underwent a stress-induced conversion to a spinel-like phase. After
the subsequent pressure release, S-LLO recovered its initial structure,
whereas an irreversible structure destruction was observed for B-LLO,
suggesting that the layered-to-spinel phase transition was dependent
on particle size. Thus, these findings are expected to benefit the
optimization of high-capacity cathode materials and show that the
use of fine-grained LLOs facilitates the accommodation of electrode
stress and improves the long-term stability of electrodes for Li-ion
battery operation.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2
To prepare
the coarse-grained (large-particle-size)
sample, stoichiometric amounts of citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O), LiCH3COO·2H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O,
and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O were dissolved
in distilled water, and the solution pH was adjusted to 7 by aqueous
ammonia. The obtained solution was concentrated on a rotary evaporator
at 80 °C to obtain a homogeneous colloidal precursor, which was
subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 150 °C and annealed at
900 °C to afford a product labeled as B-LLO.

The fine-grained
(small-particle-size) sample (S-LLO) was prepared similarly to B-LLO
using citric acid and glycol as both complexing and esterification
reagents.

Characterization
Conventional XRD analysis (Bruker
D8 X, Germany) was performed using a Cu Kα radiation at 40 keV
and 40 mA. Sample morphologies were characterized by cold-field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi, S-4800, Japan) and transmission
electron microscopy (FEI, TECNAI F20). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS; Axis Ultra, Kratos Analytical Ltd., England) measurements were
conducted at the Analytical Instrumentation Center of Peking University.
All of the spectra were calibrated using the C 1s photoemission peak
at 284.8 eV. In situ high-pressure synchrotron radiation powder XRD
measurements were performed at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(beamline 4W2). High pressure was applied at room temperature in a
diamond anvil cell using Ar gas as a pressure-transmitting medium.

Electrochemical Testing
Electrochemical properties
were evaluated employing a charge/discharge tester (Neware, China).
Coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox using glass microfiber
separators (Whatman, U.K.) and Li metal anodes. High-pressure in situ
XRD measurements were carried out after one cycle of performance testing
at a rate of 2C and for fully or half-discharged states (Li content
was determined from specific capacity). The cathode was fabricated
by mixing B-/S-LLO, poly(vinylidene difluoride) binder, and Super-P
conductive carbon black (80:10:10, w/w/w) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
and coating the obtained slurry onto Al foil. The thus-prepared cathode
was dried for 2 h in air and subsequently for 12 h in a vacuum oven
at 120 °C. The electrolyte was purchased from the Beijing Institute
of Chemical Reagents (composition not disclosed).
