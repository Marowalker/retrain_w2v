A conceptually new polymer electrolyte
for dye-sensitized solar
cells is reported and investigated. The benefits of using this type
of electrolyte based on ionic liquid mixtures (ILMs) and room temperature
ionic liquids are highlighted. Impedance spectroscopy and transient
electron measurements have been used to elucidate the background of
the photovoltaic performance. Even though larger recombination losses
were noted, the high ion mobility and conductivity induced in the
ILMs by the added polymer result in enhanced overall conversion efficiencies.

Introduction
Due to the constantly
increasing global energy demand, much attention
has been devoted to the conversion of the abundant solar energy to
electricity. In this context, another vital motive to pursue research
on renewable energy sources is the ambition to reduce the environmental
hazards associated with today’s predominant energy technologies.
Direct conversion of solar energy to electricity, for example, by
photovoltaic devices, constitutes an attractive alternative for the
future. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were converted into a promising
and alternative green technology for renewable energy in 1991 through
a seminal paper by Grätzel and O’Regan, with the main
advantages being potential cost-effective fabrication and good conversion
efficiencies.1,2 In recent reports, photoconversion
efficiencies over 12% have been obtained by using organic solvent-based
electrolytes together with a liquid electrolyte based on the ubiquitous
iodide/triiodide redox couple.3−5 The use of biosourced aqueous
gel electrolytes and newly designed bifacial quasi-solid state electrolyte-based
DSSCs were also reported.6,7 Even higher conversion
efficiencies have been obtained by use of metal-complex redox systems
approaching 15%.5,8

Room temperature ionic liquids
(ILs) present some very promising
features that make them highly attractive for DSSC applications. ILs
have been widely promoted as “green solvents” mainly
because of their typically extremely low vapor pressures and have
recently attracted considerable attention also because of their excellent
chemical and electrochemical stability, nonflammability, and high
ionic conductivity.9−17 A recent report shows that mixtures between molten salts and molecular
solvents exhibit unique physical and chemical properties differing
from their component properties. They also contribute new properties,
such as low molecular vapor pressure, wide electrochemical window,
and low viscosity. This type of fluid is denoted “incompletely
solvated ionic liquid mixtures (ILMs),” or simply “ionic
liquid mixtures” (ILMs), and are characterized by the molecular
component being present in such low ratios that there is not sufficient
number of molecules to completely solvate the ions of the salt. Of
course, any such mixture may have complex structures on the nanometer
scale, but nonetheless they contain too few molecules to physically
separate the ions from each other.18,19

As reported
elsewhere, the strategy to achieve an ionically highly
conductive electrolyte is to dissolve a suitable polymer in electrolyte
salts yielding high conductivity as compared with their parent components.
In this work, we have chosen poly(vinylidine fluoride) (PVDF) as the
polymer dopant due to its favorable chemical properties, such as chemical
stability, high dielectric constant, and resistance to UV radiation.
The above polymer in electrolyte salts, also known as polymer-in-salt
electrolytes (PISs), typically increases the ionic mobility and the
number of carrier ions.20 This effect can
be traced to an increase in ion-pair dissociation, although the exact
mechanism is currently unclear.

In the present work, we aim
to harvest the beneficial effects of
the ILs, ILMs, and PISs to prepare a conceptually new class of electrolyte
for DSSCs. The ion-conducting salt plays an important role for the
ionic conduction and a polymer matrix works as a rigid framework,
also promoting ion dissolution or ion polarization.20 The resulting new type of electrolyte shows many desirable
properties, such as low vapor pressure, chemical stability, low viscosity,
and high number of ionic charge carriers. In this work, the main focus
has been to investigate and compare this new type of electrolyte to
those based on ILs or ILMs in DSSC devices.

Results and Discussion
Photovoltaic
Performance
Figure 1 shows the I–V curves
of the DSSCs containing the electrolytes IL, IM,
and IP, displaying efficiencies of 3.6, 6.6, and 6.9% at 1 sun light
intensity, respectively. The I–V characteristics of the respective cells are given in Table 1. The cells containing the electrolytes
IM and IP show considerably higher current than those containing the
IL electrolyte. The slope of the I–V curve from the photovoltage axis can be used to estimate
the cell series resistance (and thus conductance), and from this the
total number of available ions for charge transport in the cells can
be estimated; hence, more ions are available for charge transport
in the IM- and IP-based cells, and consequently these cells show higher
photocurrents. The fabricated cells were stable without any notable
degradation even after 1000 h storage (dark conditions), which is
an indication that they at least are chemically stable.

curves of the IP-, IM-, and IL-based solar
cells.

The incident photon-to-current conversion
efficiencies (IPCEs)
for the IL-, IM-, and IP-based cells are shown in Figure 2. The IPCE spectrum for IP-based
cells shows a maximum value of 81% just below 450 nm. The IL- and
IM-based cells display a maximum value from 375 to 550 nm. The light
absorption by triiodide at shorter wavelengths can be noted as a dip
in the IPCE spectrum.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Studies
The
Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on the electrolytes IP, IM,
and IL are shown in Figure 3 and selected characteristics are assembled in Table 2. The complex impedance is defined
as Z*(ω) = Z′(ω)
– jZ″(ω), where Z′(ω) = |Z|cos θ and Z″(ω) = |Z|sin θ
are the real and the imaginary parts of the complex impedance, respectively,
and ω = 2πf is the angular frequency.
The impedance spectra were recorded for the DSSCs under open-circuit
condition with an applied bias voltage. The curves were fitted by
an electrochemical circuit model with the help of the ZView software.21 The three types of DSSCs displayed the resistance
of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) films (Rs) and external effects as a serial resistance. Going from
the left to the right (from high frequency to low frequency) in Figure 3, the typical interpretation
of the features involves a first semicircle that represents the interface
resistance (Rct) corresponding to the
charge transfer between the counterelectrode and the electrolyte in
the high-frequency region from 100 kHz to 550 Hz. As seen in the zoomed
plot, the resistance (Rct) for the IL-based
cells is comparatively small, whereas it is considerably larger for
the IM-based cells, almost by a factor of 2. The presence of 3-methoxypropionitrile
in the electrolyte IM and PVDF in the electrolyte IP influences the
electrolyte–electrode interface, as inferred by the higher Rct for the IM-based, slightly lower value for
the IP-based, and very low for IL-based cells. Interestingly, the
IP-based DSSCs show a lower Rct than the
cells based on IM. Similar observations were reported in our previous
work,22 where the Rct for DSSCs containing the solvent-containing electrolyte
(CM1) is comparably higher than those containing the added polymer
(CP1). It is clear that dilution of the ionic liquid retards the charge-transfer
process at the counterelectrode.

IM-, and IL-based cells.

The second semicircle in
the middle frequency region, from about
550 to 4 Hz, offers information about the electron recombination loss
resistance (Rrec) corresponding to the
charge transfer at the working electrode and electrolyte interface,
and the chemical capacitance produced by the accumulation of electrons
in the TiO2 film and cations at the TiO2–dye
interface (Cμ).23 The Rrec of the DSSCs decreases in the
order IL ≫ IM ≈ IP, but they are all very similar and
there should be no significant difference in electron recombination
loss for the three types of electrolytes in the DSSCs.

The resistance
in the low-frequency region (Rd), from
4 Hz to 10 mHz, relates to the diffusion impedance
of the electrolyte. The diffusion resistance decreases in the order
IL ≫ IM ≈ IP. This clearly indicates that the ionic
mobility is lower in the IL electrolyte than in the other two. Another
way of presenting the complex impedance is by displaying the frequency
response of the modulus of impedance and phase angle, as shown in
the Supporting Information (Figure S1), for the DSSCs based on the IL, IM,
and IP electrolytes. The conductivity (σ) and electron lifetime
(τ) were calculated according to the procedures described in
an earlier report22 and the values were
tabulated (Table 2).
The conductivity of the electrolyte solution is proportional to the
number of charge carriers and also inversely proportional to the medium
viscosity,24 relations that match well
with our viscosity studies (Table 2). The difference observed between IP- and IM-based
cells is difficult to distinguish from the above results and further
analysis based on alternating current (AC) conductivity was used to
identify the different conduction mechanisms in the DSSCs.

Transient
Measurements
The electron lifetime (τe)
is shown as a function of voltage in Figure 4. The electron lifetime was determined at
open-circuit conditions using a modulated light source. The changes
in electron concentration are mainly affected by recombination because
the current and bias light are fixed. The time constant found by the
voltage decay can be used to calculate the electron lifetime.25 At zero current, the IM- and IL-based cells
show similar behavior, whereas the IP-based cells show shorter electron
lifetimes, indicating faster electron loss reactions. These results
are consistent with the EIS data, where the IP-based cells display
larger recombination losses. However, because of the higher electrolyte
conductivity, the cells anyhow are the ones performing the best in
overall conversion efficiency.

Figure 4 Electron lifetime as a function of open-circuit
voltage for the
IP-, IM-, and IL-based cells.

The extracted charge Qoc as a
function
of Voc for the DSSCs based on the IL,
IM, and IP electrolytes are shown in Figure 5. It is clearly noted that cells based on
the IM and IP electrolytes exhibit very similar extracted charges
at higher voltages, whereas the IL-based TiO2 films are
slightly less charged. At lower voltages (essentially corresponding
to lower light intensities), the IP-based cells clearly outperform
the others, which is in accordance with the electron lifetime results.
These results also match the higher Jsc obtained in the I–V measurements.

Figure 5 Extracted
charge as a function of open-circuit voltage for the
IP-, IM-, and IL-based cells.

The electron lifetime (τe) is shown as a
function
of total charge in Figure 6. The IP- and IM-based DSSCs show longer electron lifetimes
than IL-based ones. This is in good agreement with the EIS studies,
which indicate slightly larger recombination losses for the IP- and
IM-based cells. Transport times are nearly the same for all types
of cells at lower current, which indicates that the three electrolytes
have the same effect on TiO2 with respect to the electron
conduction processes. The transport time with respect to short-circuit
current for the IP-, IM-, and IL-based cells are shown in Figure S5.

Figure 6 Electron lifetime as a function of total
charge for IP-, IM-, and
IL-based cells.

The overall beneficial
factor of the addition of polymer to this
type of electrolyte is that it very clearly yields an increase in
photocurrent. This increase is likely to be caused by an increase
in the ion mobility in the bulk electrolyte.

Conclusions
In this present work, we investigated the merits of using a conceptually
new electrolyte. The IM-based cells rendered a conversion efficiency
of 6.6% and those of IP-based cells 6.9%. The use of both ILMs and
polymer addition gives a boost in conversion efficiency. This new
electrolyte, in spite of larger recombination losses, offers an overall
higher ion mobility and thus photocurrent, which, in turn, results
in higher conversion efficiencies. The current results encourage further
studies on the effects of polymer addition for enhancing the DSSC
efficiency.

Experimental Methods
Materials and Methods
All of the
chemicals were used
without further purification. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) (Alfa
Aesar), ionic liquid (ethyl-methyl-imidazolium dicyanamide (EMIDCA))
was obtained from Merck, methyl benzimidazole and 3-methoxypropionitrile
from Sigma-Aldrich, and guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) and 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium
iodide (PMII) from Alfa Aesar. The dye D35 was obtained from Dyenamo
AB, Sweden. The TiO2 pastes (DSL 18NR-T and WER2-O) were
obtained from Dyesol, Ltd.

Electrolyte Preparation
Poly(vinylidine
fluoride) was
dissolved in 3-methoxypropionitrile (1.5 wt %) and stirred at 100
°C for 2.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the following
recipes were employed for the preparation of the electrolytes for
comparative studies, where the polymer solution is used in the third
recipe:

Recipe 1: ionic liquid (EMIDCA) 200
μL, I2 0.2 M, GuSCN 0.1 M, PMII 1 M, and 0.5 M methyl
benzimidazole (IL).

Recipe 2: ionic liquid
(EMIDCA) 100 μL,
I2 0.2 M, GuSCN 0.1 M, PMII 1 M, and 0.5 M methyl benzimidazole
in 100 μL 3-methoxypropionitrile (IM).

Recipe 3: ionic liquid (EMIDCA) 100 μL,
I2 0.2 M, GuSCN 0.1 M, PMII 1 M, and 0.5 M methyl benzimidazole
in 100 μL in PVDF–MPN solution (IP).

The viscosities
of the electrolytes were determined using a Brookfield
(CAP 2000+) viscometer.

Electrode Preparation
The glass
substrates with a transparent
conductive film (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), TEC15; Pilkington)
were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath following the consecutive steps
soap water, acetone, and ethanol; 20 min in each step. Then, the FTO
substrates were pretreated by immersion into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed using water
and ethanol. The TiO2 screen-printing employed a DSL 18NR-T
(Dyesol Ltd.) paste, and after the screen-printing procedure, the
glass electrodes were stored in an atmosphere of EtOH for 5 min and
then dried at 120 °C for 5–6 min. Finally, the procedure
was repeated for a second time to obtain a uniform film. Areas of
0.25 cm2 of photoactive TiO2 films were screen-printed.
After cooling of the electrodes, a light-scattering TiO2 layer (WER2-O; Dyesol Ltd.) was printed. Thereafter, the electrodes
were gradually fired in the ambient atmosphere in three steps of temperature
increase; 180 (10 min), 325 (10 min), 420 (10 min), and 450 °C
(30 min). After sintering, the electrodes were again treated with
a 40 mM TiCl4 solution in water at 70 °C for 30 min
and washed according to the previously described process. The substrates
were again sintered at 500 °C (30 min; thickness 13 μm,
Veeco Dektak 3). After the final step of sintering, the electrodes
were allowed to cool to 80 °C and directly immersed into a bath
of dye at 0.25 M D35 in ethanol and left over night. Platinized counterelectrode
substrates (TEC15; Pilkington) were prepared by deposition of 20 μL
of 4.8 mM H2PtCl6 2-propanol solution to a predrilled
FTO glass substrate; the platinized electrodes were sintered in ambient
atmosphere at 400 °C for 30 min.22

Solar Cell Assembly and Characterization
The working
electrodes and the counterelectrodes were combined into a sandwich-type
device by a 25 μm thick Surlyn thermoplastic frame (Solaronix),
and the electrolyte was immersed via a predrilled hole through the
glass plate of the counterelectrode. Finally, the hole was sealed
using Surlyn and a glass coverslip.

A Keithley 2400 source meter
was used to record the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics in combination with a Newport solar simulator
(model 91160) based on AM 1.5 G spectral distribution. Calibration
was based on a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) at
an intensity of 1000 W m–2, alternatively using
a neutral density filter at 100 W m–2. Scattered
light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer was reduced using a mask of the size 7 × 7 mm2. This procedure also reduces the contribution from light outside
the active area. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies
(IPCEs) were monitored by monochromatized light from a system comprising
a xenon lamp, monochromator, suitable filters, and a potentiostat.
A certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) was used for calibration.
Electron lifetimes for fully operational solar cells were determined
using a green light-emitting diode (1 W; Luxeon) as the light source.
A 16 bit data acquisition board (DAQ National Instruments) combined
with a current amplifier (Stanford Research SR570) were used to record
the voltage/current traces. Charge extraction was determined following
a procedure in which the solar cell was illuminated during 5 s under
open circuit, after which the light was switched off and the voltage
decay was monitored to a specific voltage V. At this
voltage V, the cell was short-circuited, and the
current was recorded during 10 s. Integration provided the charge, Qoc (V). Electron lifetimes were monitored following
the photovoltage response after a small perturbation of the light
intensity.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
An Autolab
PGstat12 potentiostat was used to record the electrochemical impedance
spectra (EISs). The potentiostat was with equipped with an impedance
module allowing a frequency range of 10–2 to 106 Hz, at 20 mV AC bias under light illumination in combination
with an applied bias potential.22 The ZView
program was used to model the experimental data.21
