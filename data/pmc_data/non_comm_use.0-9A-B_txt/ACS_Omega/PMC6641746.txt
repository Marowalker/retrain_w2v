Superhydrophobic
and oleophilic sponges have been demonstrated
as promising candidates for oil/water separation. However, there are
still challenges in large-scale fabrication of superhydrophobic sponges
with low cost and feasible method for industrial applications. Herein,
we report a superhydrophobic and oleophilic melamine sponge functionalized
by a uniform polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film that can be easily coated
onto the sponge skeleton through UV-assisted thiol–ene click
reactions. The PDMS films are characterized by a hierarchically striped
microstructure with an average distance less than 2 μm. Because
of the striped microstructure and the hydrophobic property of silicone,
a high contact angle of 156.2° was achieved. Importantly, the
interconnected open-cell structure of the melamine sponge was preserved
by adapting the thickness of the PDMS film. The PDMS-coated melamine
sponge exhibited a desirable absorption capacity of 103–179
times its own weight with oils and organic solvents. The excellent
mechanical properties of melamine and the flexibility of PDMS enable
the PDMS-coated melamine sponges to be squeezed repeatedly without
collapsing. This study offers a robust and effective approach in large-scale
preparation of a superhydrophobic sponge for large-scale oil spill
containment and environmental remediation by the inexpensive commercial
polymethylvinylsilicone and facile dip-coating/UV-curing method.

Introduction
Oil spills and industrial
organic pollutants have resulted in severe
water pollution that threatens every species in the ecological system
from low-grade algae to higher mammals, including human beings.1 For example, 4.9 million barrels of crude oil
was released in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in catastrophic damage
to marine and aquatic ecosystems.2 Concurrently,
oily water in inland water has significant impacts on public health.
Therefore, efficiently separating the oil from the water is a trending
environmental concern. Traditional methods of oil separation include
physical methods, chemical methods, and biological methods for recovering
spilled oil on water. However, these traditional methods such as skimming
systems, in situ burning, dispersants, and sorbents can have limitations.3 High cost, oily water collection, and less than
ideal marine climate often limit the use of these traditional methods.4 Fortunately, the rapid development of interface
science has offered brand-new solutions for separating oil/water mixtures
including simple oil/water layered mixture and oil/water emulsion.5−7 Superhydrophobic and porous interfaces, including two-dimensional
meshes8−11 and three-dimensional sponges, can efficiently achieve the remediation
of water system polluted by oil. However, two-dimensional membranes
and meshes need to collect the oily water prior to disposal, resulting
in energy consumption and lack of efficiency. Three-dimensional superhydrophobic
porous materials offer a promising solution with low energy. Until
now, graphene and graphene oxide sponges,12 silicone sponges,13−15 porous nanocellulose aerogels,16,17 carbon nanofiber aerogels,18 cotton fabric,19,20 Janus polymers,21 and carbon soot sponges22 have been developed for oil absorption without
energy consumption. Accordingly, superhydrophobic three-dimensional
materials are typically fabricated using one of the two strategies:
the first is to construct porous sponges with superhydrophobic materials
and the second is to modify chemicals with low surface energy on a
porous sponge frame. The second method is simpler and cheaper in application.
On the other hand, some sophisticated hierarchical surface topologies
with superhydrophobicity have been fabricated following the biomimetic
principles.23−25 Two key factors that dominate the wettability of
the surface are surface chemical composition and surface topography.26 Lotus leaves have superhydrophobicity properties
because of their micropapillae nanostructure, and lotus leaf-inspired
materials have been prepared as superhydrophobic coatings for different
applications.26−28 However, previous processes for fabrication of biomimic
superhydrophobic surface are complex and restricting their scale preparation
and industrial applications.29

A
powerful strategy for modern materials science called click chemistry,
coined by Sharpless and colleagues in 2001, describes organic reactions
with highly selective, simple orthogonal reactions and exhibits high
efficiency under a variety of mild conditions.30 Several processes, such as the nucleophilic ring-opening
reactions, the non-aldol carbonyl chemistry, the additions to carbon–carbon
multiple bonds, and the cycloaddition reactions, were identified.
The radical-mediated thiol–ene reaction proceeds rapidly to
a high yield with high efficiency; this is typical for a click reaction.
Furthermore, the thiol–ene reaction is photoinitiated for functional
polymers.31 As a second-order reaction,
the conversion of thiol groups increases rapidly during the initial
stage of UV-curing.32 Therefore, the thiol–ene
click chemistry has been used in numerous applications, such as optical
components, adhesives, and high-impact energy-absorbing materials.31,33 In addition, thiol–ene chemistry is also a popular surface
modification reaction by “grafting-from” and “grafting-onto”
approaches. Typically, thiopropionic acid and thiol alkanes were attached
to polymethylvinylsilicone by thiol–ene reactions to adjust
the surface wetting property.34 Advincula
fabricated a highly efficient mesh with superhydrophobic coating by
thiol–ene reaction.35 When compared
with tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane, polymethylvinylsilicone is seemingly
an idyllic choice for preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces by
the click reaction method. First, the polysilicone backbone exhibits
a low surface tension value of around 21 mN/m, which is suitable for
water repellency.36 Second, the rich vinyl
group pendant from the backbone can be cured by multithiol cross-links.
The UV-induced curing process and commercial polysilicone provide
a unique opportunity to scale the preparation of extremely hydrophobic
surfaces in an eco-friendly and economically friendly fashion.

Here, we report a simplistic and inexpensive two-step procedure
to produce polysilicone-coated melamine sponges, which involves dip-coating
of polymethylvinylsilicone (PMVS) with a multithiol cross-linker onto
the melamine sponge, followed by UV-curing. The efficient click chemistry
of the thiol–ene reaction results in a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS)-coated melamine sponge with superhydrophobicity for oil/water
separation. Surface topography, oil/water separation efficiency, and
thermal stability were studied.

Results and Discussion
The overall fabrication process of PDMS-coated melamine sponges
consisted of two main steps. First, the linear PMVS and the cross-linker
pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate) (PETMP) were coated onto
the melamine skeleton by the dip-coating method. The thiol–ene
cross-linking reaction was then performed under UV light. The click
reactions between rich vinyl groups and multithiol PETMP resulted
in the cross-linked PDMS network uniformly covering the melamine skeleton
(Figure 1a). The PMVS
concentration was well-controlled in order to adjust the thickness
of the coated PDMS film. The successful fabrication of the PDMS-coated
melamine sponge was evident from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman spectra,
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs.

Figure 1a shows
the photoinitiated thiol–ene click reaction leading to cross-linked
PDMS. The successful coating of cross-linked PDMS onto the sponge
frame was confirmed by XPS, FTIR, TGA, EDS, and Raman spectra. Figure 1b shows the typical
XPS survey spectra of pristine melamine sponge and PDMS-modified melamine
sponge. Both samples exhibit a C 1s peak at 284.8 eV and an O 1s peak
at 531.7 eV. Si 2s and Si 2p peaks were found at 151.8 and 102.1 eV,
respectively. This evidences that PDMS was successfully attached to
the sponge frame during the dipping-coating process. The N 1s peak
located at 397.7 eV was detected on the pristine melamine surface
and disappeared in the PDMS-modified sponge spectrum. This indicates
that the small amount of nitrogen species was completely covered by
the PDMS layer. These XPS results are consist with those of PDMS-modified
sponges by Sylgard 184.37 The XPS S 1s
peak was not found because of the low content of the S element and
the immigration of Si–CH3 groups to the surface
of PDMS. However, the existence of sulfur can be easily confirmed
by the corresponding EDS spectrum. As shown in Figure 1e, despite sulfur being detected by EDS,
there was no significant change of the peak intensity of the sulfur
element with sulfur content. This is further evidence that the immigration
of silicone chains leads to the difficulty in the detection of sulfur
and nitrogen because XPS and EDS are surface-sensitive spectroscopic
techniques. As expected, silicon was detected by EDS spectra in each
PDMS-modified melamine sponge surface, and its intensity increased
significantly with the PDMS concentration. This result indicates that
the thickness of PDMS coating can be adjusted by the concentration
of the PMVS solution. Figure 1c shows the ATR–FTIR spectra of the pristine melamine
sponge and PDMS-coated melamine sponge. Absorption peaks at 809, 1546,
and 3359 cm–1 were assigned to C=N stretching
in the triazine ring, C–H stretching, and N–H and −OH,
respectively. The peaks at 1338 and 1481 cm–1 are
attributed to the stretching of C–N. The spectrum of the PDMS-coated
melamine sponge was similar to that of the pristine melamine sponge.
The characteristic absorption peaks of silicon–oxygen–silicon
at 1260, 1157, and 1102 cm–1 were observed, indicating
that PDMS coating has been successfully coated onto the melamine sponge
skeleton. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peak of SH at 2571
cm–1 disappeared and the peaks at 1629 and 1410
cm–1 (Figure S1), which
are attributed to C=C in PMVS, also disappeared. These results
indicate that most vinyl groups and SH groups were exhausted by the
thiol–ene click reaction. The rapid reaction proceeding with
high curing efficiency under mild conditions exhibits the characters
of the thiol–ene click reaction. This robust UV-curing method
provides the feasibility for large-scale production, that is, both
low cost and eco-friendliness. The successful coating of PDMS on the
sponge frame was further investigated by TGA (Figure 1d). Both pristine melamine sponge and PDMS-coated
melamine sponge exhibited three stages of weight loss under a nitrogen
atmosphere from 20 to 800 °C. The first mass loss at a temperature
of 120 °C is primarily attributed to the evaporation of the absorbed
water in sponges, which is about 5–7 wt %. There is no effect
of PDMS coating on the thermal decomposition temperature of the melamine
skeleton at 379–420 °C (38 wt %), but it is obvious that
the mass loss of the PDMS-coated melamine sponge (27 wt %) decreased
because of the thermally stable PDMS coating not decomposing under
a nitrogen atmosphere. The Raman spectra patterns of the melamine
sponge and PDMS-coated melamine sponge are presented in Figure 1f. Compared to the spectrum
of the pristine melamine sponge, the spectrum of the PDMS-coated melamine
sponge exhibits three remarkable bands at around 486, 706, and 2907
cm–1, which correspond to the Si–O–Si,
Si–CH3, and CH3 vibration, respectively.
XPS, FTIR, TGA, EDS, and Raman spectra results confirmed the successful
coating of PDMS on the sponge framework.

Morphology of Sponges
SEM, as shown in Figure 2, examined the morphologies
of the pristine melamine sponge and PDMS-coated melamine sponges.
The pristine melamine sponge comprised a three-dimensional porous
structure with concave triangular fibers. The skeletons of the melamine
sponge are smooth with an average diameter of ∼7.6 μm.
Compared to the pristine melamine sponge, the PDMS-coated melamine
sponges have unique morphologies. First, a thin, uniform layer of
PDMS film was coated onto the sponge skeleton. Each melamine skeleton
was covered continuously with PDMS without defect. PMVS and multithiol
cross-linker solution can be adsorbed evenly on the melamine skeleton
because of the amphiphilic property of melamine. Second, interesting
regularly arranged resembling strips were observed throughout the
whole sponge skeleton. Curing-induced shrinkage and migration of silicone
result in undulating wrinkles with an average distance between these
strips less than 2 μm, and the width of these strips is about
0.8 μm. Finally, the average diameter of the sponge skeleton
fibers was increased to 8.4, 9.4, and 9.9 μm with the increase
of the PMVS concentration as 1, 5, and 10 wt %, respectively. Importantly,
small amounts of closed cells appeared (Figure 2g, inset) when the PMVS concentration increased
to 10 wt %, which would be hazardous to the absorption capacity of
the modified sponges. There were nearly no closed cells when the concentration
of PMVS is less than 5% by mass. These results indicated that PMVS
solution can be adhered to the surface of the sponge skeleton fibers
uniformly and thiol–ene click reaction completes rapidly under
UV light.

of PMVS.

Superwetting of PDMS-Coated
Sponges
Wetting properties
of the sponges were explored by analyzing the behavior of water drops
and oil drops on the sponge surface. The pristine melamine sponge
exhibits amphiphilic properties, and the PDMS-coated sponge was oleophilic
(Figure 3a). The difference
in the PDMS-coated sponge is reflected in its wetting property, when
in contact with water (Figure 3b). The PDMS-coated sponge samples show a superhydrophobic
character with contact angles more than 150° (Figure 3f). The surface chemical composition
and surface topography are the main factors that determine the wetting
property of the surface. It is known that a high surface roughness
brings a significant change in the wetting property of the surface. Figure 3c depicts the large
magnifications of the PDMS-coated melamine sponge skeleton, and regular
undulating wrinkles are visible. Thereby, polysilicone ensures the
low surface energy of the sponge skeleton, and surface roughness enhances
the surface hydrophobicity. Compared with a smooth surface, water
drops on the surface with high roughness tend to reflect the Cassie
model, which corresponds to the lowest energy state in the open-air
regime (Figure 3c,d).
The roughness makes water drops have more than one metastable position
of equilibrium, and water drops can transfer from one metastable equilibrium
to the other, resulting in superhydrophobic property.38 Because of the stability of the silicone material, the
PDMS-coated sponge also shows superhydrophobic property against acid,
alkali, and NaCl solutions (Figure S2).
The water sliding angle on the PDMS-coated sponges was tested to be
about 8°. As we know, a superhydrophobic surface with a sliding
angle lower than 10° often indicates that this surface owns self-cleaning
property. The self-cleaning property was also confirmed by antifouling
test. The antifouling test showed that the PDMS-coated sponge remained
very clean against dyed water (Figure S3).

Oil/Water Separation
The superhydrophobic surface property
and a large amount of open cells make the PDMS-coated melamine sponge
a viable material for the rapid removal of various oils and organic
solvents from water. Selective sorption is a crucial property of oil/water
separation materials, particularly for oil spill remediation in aqueous
environments. As shown in Figure 4, both oil-red dyed float hexane and sank chloroform
were removed quickly and completely when the PDMS-coated melamine
sponge was in contact with the oils, and clean water was left in only
a few seconds. The PDMS-coated melamine sponge has different sorption
performances with different oils and organic solvents. Figure 5a shows the maximum sorption
capacity for oils and solvents in the absence of water. The mass-based
sorption capacity for oils was 103–179 times the weight of
the individual sponge. The excellent oil/solvent sorption capacity
is attributed to the highly porous structure as well as the oleophilic
properties. Because of the excellent mechanical strength of the commercial
melamine sponge, the shape integrity and porous structure of the sponges
can be well kept even after 10 sorption/squeezing cycles (Figure 5b). The hydrophobic
property was sustained because of the flexibility of PDMS.

observation of the phenomenon.

Conclusions
In summary, this study put forth a facile
approach for fabricating
superhydrophobic and oleophilic PDMS-coated melamine sponges by dip-coating
and thiol–ene click reaction. The interconnected open-cell
structure was sustained by adjusting the PMVS concentration of the
coating solution. The regularly arranged resembling strips made the
PDMS-coated melamine sponge superhydrophobic and oleophilic. The high
mass absorption capacities toward different oils and organic solvents
demonstrate the new opportunities for fast oil/water separation. Importantly,
not only does our study highlight a convenient method toward engineering
superhydrophobic three-dimensional sponges, but it also provides hopes
to industrial large-scale production in the near future.

Experimental
Section
Materials
PMVS (viscosity ≈ 3000 mPa·s)
with a vinyl content of 10 mol % was obtained from Shin-Etsu Chemical
Co. PETMP was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. (Beijing, China).
Melamine sponges were purchased from a commercial store (7.90 ×
10–3 g/cm3). The solvents and oils used
in the absorption experiments were used as received without further
purification.

Preparation of the Superhydrophobic Melamine
Sponge by Thiol–Ene
Click Reaction
The silanization of the melamine sponges was
performed by the dip-coating process and photocuring. The PMVS sample
(2.56 g, 0.40 mmol C=C groups) and PETMP (1 equiv, 0.10 mmol)
were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1, 2, 3, 5, and 10
wt %). The melamine sponges were cut into 3 × 2.2 × 1.8
cm3 pieces and were immersed in a solution of PMVS and
PETMP in CH2Cl2 (1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 wt %) for
5 min. Subsequently, the sponges were removed from the solution, then
squeezed to extract the absorbed solution, and finally irradiated
at room temperature with a WFH-204B lamp at 365 nm with a light intensity
of 107 mW·cm–2 for 10 min. They were then repeatedly
washed with CH2Cl2 using the sorption/squeezing
process for the removal of any unreacted starting materials. Finally,
they were dried in air for 6 h. The resultant silanized melamine sponges
were denoted as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10% PDMS-coated.

Characterization
TGA was conducted on a TG Q500 thermogravimetric
analyzer under a heating rate of 10 °C/min. ATR–FTIR spectra
were recorded on a Thermo Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrophotometer with a
universal ATR sampling accessory. Surface analysis was performed by
an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with ESCALAB 250Xi apparatus equipped
with monochromator Al Kα as the X-ray source. An energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometer fitted to the scanning electron microscope was
used for chemical elemental identification. The micromorphologies
were observed by SEM with an S-4800 field emission electron microscope
at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The wetting properties of the
PDMS-coated sponge were investigated by static contact angle measurements
at room temperature using a CA 20 contact angle goniometer with a
droplet volume of 5 μL.

Oil Absorption Experiments
The absorption capacities
of the PDMS-coated sponge for various oils and organic solvents were
determined by dipping a piece of PDMS-coated sponge into the liquid
(oil or organic solvent) until the PDMS-coated sponge was saturated
with the liquid and left to drip for 30 s for weight measurement.
Repeated sorption/squeezing processes were used to evaluate the recyclability
of the PDMS-coated sponge.
