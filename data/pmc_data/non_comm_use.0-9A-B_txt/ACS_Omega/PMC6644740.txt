Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8
shares the same topology with
sodalite zeolite but consists of Zn nodes bridged by imidazolate linkers
to form a neutral open-framework structure. ZIF-8 has been recognized
as a unique molecular sieving material with a flexible framework enabling
interesting “gate-opening” functionality. Controlling
the crystal size and shape is crucial for regulating the structural
flexibilities and mass transport properties. The present study demonstrates
that an aqueous-system-enabled spray-drying process enables the shape
engineering of ZIF-8 with a hollow polycrystalline structure. It is
notable that our synthesis route produces an amorphous zinc complex
compound, which possesses a continuous random network partially with
crystalline fillers, after spray drying followed by an amorphous-to-crystal
transition via activation treatment using polar organic solvents.
The size of primary ZIF-8 crystals consisting of secondary polycrystals
depends on the kind of the organic solvent. The macro-/microscopic
structures of hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8 significantly structurally
enhanced the adsorption capacity and uptake rate. The large-scale,
rapid production and enhanced adsorption performances make this continuous
method a very promising candidate for industrial applications and
shaping of MOF.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs)1−4 offer many interesting opportunities
in adsorption technology, with unprecedented capacities and chemical
and structural tunabilities. Among the many MOFs, zeolitic imidazolate
framework-8 (ZIF-8, Zn(2-methylimidazole)2) is undoubtedly
the most extensively studied because of its facile synthesis coupled
with its exceptional chemical and thermal stabilities.5−7 ZIF-8 is crystallized into the sodalite topology, forming large
cages (a diameter of 11.6 Å) interconnected via narrow six-ring
windows (3.4 Å). Such a framework structure gives ZIF-8 particularly
interesting “gate-opening” functionality. Numerous experimental
and computational studies have revealed that the pore apertures swing
open by the reorientation of imidazolate linkers and expand when probed
with guest molecules.8−15 More recently, the influences of the crystal size and shape on the
adsorption-induced structural transition and framework flexibility
have been recognized.16−18 To take advantage of this unique adsorption property
for adsorption, control in the framework flexibility is of crucial
importance. Besides the nanostructure control, the control of the
crystal size and shape is a key breakthrough toward the development
of practical applications.

A great deal of effort has been made
to develop a method of synthesizing
MOFs, including solvothermal, microwave-assisted,19 sonochemical,20,21 mechanochemical,22,23 and electrochemical24 techniques. Recently,
spray-drying technique has been demonstrated as a continuous and scalable
process.25 However, most of these methods
share a conventional method that MOFs are crystallized in organic
solution using N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) and methanol. On the other hand, aqueous synthesis has opened
up environmental friendly and efficient ways to synthesize MOFs.26−28 Compared with the crystallization in organic solutions, the aqueous
synthesis of ZIF-8 has particular advantages in terms of operation,
economy, and high-yield production. However, the aqueous synthesis
requires excessive 2-methylimidazole for the synthesis of ZIF-8 than
the stoichiometric proportion of Zn(2-methylimidazole)2. In the aqueous synthesis of ZIF-8,28 free Zn2+ ions are easily complexed with OH to form solute
species of type Zn(OH)i2–i with i = 1–4 and then byproducts
such as zinc hydroxide are yielded. For the crystallization of phase-pure
ZIF-8 in water, it is necessary to increase the population of free
deprotonated 2-methylimidazole by increasing its concentration.

Herein, we describe an aqueous-system-enabled spray-drying method
for the synthesis of ZIF-8. It is notable that our synthesis route
produces an amorphous zinc complex compound, which possesses a continuous
random network with crystalline fillers, after spray drying followed
by an amorphous-to-crystal transition via activation treatment using
polar organic solvents. Our spray-drying method is a rapid, continuous,
and organic solvent minimization technique, enabling not only large-scale
production but also the formation of unique hollow polycrystalline
particles with several micrometers in diameter. This method is advantageous
for avoiding the use of large excess of 2-methylimidazole and allowing
the synthesis of ZIF-8 in stoichiometric proportion. Furthermore,
it is found that the polycrystalline micron-sized particles consisting
of primary ZIF-8 nanocrystals clearly show the advantages of bulky
rhodamine B adsorption capacity and uptake rate and hexane uptake
rate over ZIF-8 monocrystals.

Results and Discussion
The coordinated
reaction occurred immediately after the precursor
solution was stirred for 1 min before feeding to the spray dryer.
Therefore, the obtained white suspension was continuously fed and
spray-dried, and the white powdery SD-asmade was obtained. On the
other hand, nonSD-asmade was collected from the precursor solution
by centrifugation. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of initial
efforts to characterize SD-asmade are shown in Figure 1. To the best of our knowledge, such a crystal
structure of nonSD-asmade has been unreported. The reflection peaks
cannot be correlated with those of basic zinc hydroxides. Although
the crystal structure of the nonSD-asmade remains unknown, the structure
was found to have high density (on the order of decreasing of the d spacing: 7.3, 5.1, 4.8, 3.6 Å, and so on). The PXRD
pattern of SD-asmade shows some reflection peaks attributed to the
nonSD-asmade. On the other hand, the decrease in the nonSD-asmade
peak intensity and broad band at around 2θ = 15°, visible
for the SD-asmade, indicate the conversion from the crystalline to
the amorphous form and/or crystal downsizing in the process of spray
drying.

Figure 1 PXRD patterns of nonSD-asmade, SD-asmade, and SD-x.

Figure 2 shows the
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the SD-asmade and nonSD-asmade
particles. It is interesting to note that the shape of the particles
differs greatly between the SD-asmade and the nonSD-asmade. The nonSD-asmade
particles are cross-shaped crystals. On the other hand, the SD-asmade
particles show a smooth spherical shape with an average diameter of
3.9 μm. The diameter of spray-dried particles is directly related
to the spray droplet size. The TEM images suggested that both SD-asmade
and nonSD-asmade have a dense solid structure. Both of them hardly
adsorbed nitrogen, as shown in Figure S1. Combining PXRD and TEM results, these results reveal that the SD-asmade
and nonSD-asmade possess a dense framework.

Figure 2 FESEM (left, scale bar:
1 μm) and TEM (right, scale bar:
500 nm) images of the nonSD-asmade and SD-asmade.

When particles are prepared from spray drying of a precursor
containing
colloidal particles, the colloidal particles are included in the spray-dried
particles. With the cross-shaped nonSD-asmade contained inside, the
surface of the spherical spray-dried particles should become irregular
because of the dispersion of the nonSD-asmade and heterogeneous shrinkage
of the droplet. However, in our case, the fact that the SD-asmade
has a smooth spherical shape may be caused by the shape/structure
evolution of the nonSD-asmade including amorphization and crystal
downsizing during the spray-drying process.

Figure 3 shows the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the SD-asmade and nonSD-asmade
particles with a comparison to monocrystalline ZIF-8. The FTIR spectra
confirmed that the bands of the SD-asmade were same as those of the
nonSD-asmade, with the exception of a broad band at around 3200 cm–1 observed in the spectra of the SD-asmade. The broad
band is assigned to the physically adsorbed water and Zn–OH
groups. The narrow band observed at 3650 cm–1 is
assigned to the free Zn–OH groups. The presence of these bands
indicates that both SD-asmade and nonSD-asmade are in the hydrated
form. In addition, the bands of the SD-asmade and the nonSD-asmade
at 500–550 and 900 cm–1 are attributed to
the presence of acetic acid. On the other hand, the convoluted bands
of ZIF-8 at 420, 700–750, 1000–1300, 1350–1500,
1580, and 2929/3135 cm–1 are ascribed to Zn–N,
out-of-plane bending and in-plane bending of the imidazole ring, entire
ring stretching, C=N, and aliphatic/aromatic C–H bonds
of the imidazole ring, respectively. Although the spectral intensity
loss of Zn–N coordination bond is realized for the SD-asmade
and nonSD-asmade compared to ZIF-8, both of them possess a Zn–(2-methylimidazole)
coordination framework.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of nonSD-asmade, SD-asmade, and
ZIF-8.

The thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and TGA–mass spectrometry
(MS) curves of the SD-asmade and nonSD-asmade are shown in Figure 4. TGA performed on
the nonSD-asmade revealed structural stability up to 400 °C,
which is comparable to ZIF-8. The weight loss in the temperature range
400–500 °C can be mainly attributed to the decomposition
of 2-methylimidazole strongly coordinated with Zn. On the other hand,
for the SD-asmade, two weight loss peaks centered at around 200 and
400 °C were observed. The weight loss at around 200 °C accompanied
the evolution of species with m/z of 59.6 (probably for acetic acid) and 80.6 (probably for 2-methylimidazole).
These results indicate that the SD-asmade possesses two types of 2-methylimidazole
in the structure: (1) coordination state with Zn and (2) relatively
“free” state. Pure ZIF-8, Zn(2-methylimidazole)2, is decomposed and oxidized to pure ZnO, resulting in 65%
of the starting weight loss.23,28 The total weight loss
was 54% for the nonSD-asmade, indicating that 2-methylimidazole is
insufficient for the formation of open-framework structure with sodalite
topology. On the other hand, the SD-asmade showed a 75% total weight
loss because it contains 2-methylimidazole coordinated with Zn, free
2-methylimidazole, water, and acetic acid in the structure. Therefore,
the SD-asmade is hydrophilic and can be easily dispersed in polar
solvents.

Figure 4 TGA curves (top) of nonSD-asmade, SD-asmade, zinc acetate, and
2-methylimidazole. TGA–MS curve (bottom) of SD-asmade.

In a general spray-drying process,
the solvent evaporates, forming
a layer of higher concentration of the precursor at the outer boundary
of the particle.29 During this process,
hollow superstructures can be formed by a nonlinear change in precursor
concentration at the droplet and subsequent formation of an impermeable
shell and generation of gas at the core.30,31 However, in our case, the SD-asmade was dense spherical particles
with a smooth surface. The spray-drying process starts with atomization
injection of the precursor solution into a formation of microdroplets
including the nonSD-asmade particles. Thus, the droplets contact a
gas stream heated at 150 °C, causing the solvent to begin evaporating.
The rapid solvent evaporation enhances the reaction between residual
Zn2+ ions and 2-methylimidazole or water. Zinc acetate
reacts with 2-methylimidazole and/or water, releasing acetic acid
as a byproduct. As the evaporating droplet shrinks, its receding droplet
surface leads to increasing particle density of the nonSD-asmade in
the droplet. On the other hand, the increasing concentration of the
byproduct acetic acid in droplets induces the dissolution/amorphization
of the nonSD-asmade particles and rearrangement of Zn–(2-methylimidazole)
and Zn–(water) coordination bonds, resulting in the formation
of amorphous dense spherical particles with nanosized nonSD-asmade
fillers. Consequently, the droplet including the nonSD-asmade particles
changes its shape into dense spheres with a smooth surface.

Surprisingly, such an amorphous zinc complex compound was converted
into ZIF-8 by contact with polar organic solvents. Figures 1 and S2 show the PXRD patterns of SD-x. After contacting the SD-asmade with
a polar organic solvent, new reflection peaks appeared, which correspond
to a family of lattice planes of sodalite ZIF-8. The changes in the
PXRD patterns revealed the conversion from the amorphous to the sodalite
crystalline form in the organic solvent. In addition, the reflection
peaks of SD-methanol are broader than those of SD-butanol (Figure 1), suggesting that
the crystallite size varies depending on the kind of the organic solvent,
as discussed in more detail later. On the other hand, apolar solvents,
such as toluene, benzene, and hexane, cause little or no change in
structural transition. In SD-water, the structure was converted from
amorphous to the same crystal similar to the nonSD-asmade (Figure S3). 2-Methylimidazole is highly symmetric
and exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms because the proton can
be located on either of the two nitrogen atoms. The formation of ZIF-8
involves the coordination of Zn2+ ion with the electron-deficient
pyridinic nitrogen of 2-methylimidazole. This coordination polarizes
the proton of the pyridinic group, then allowing another Zn2+ ion to coordinate with the other nitrogen of 2-methylimidazole.
In polar organic solvents capable of generating hydrogen bonding,
a destabilization of the pyridinic proton could induce, facilitating
the evolution of coordination bond relocation. The interaction between
the amorphous zinc complex compound and the polar solvent provokes
the structural rearrangement and amorphous-to-crystal phase transition.

The SD-asmade particles hardly adsorbed nitrogen, indicating a
nonporous structure. On the other hand, the type-I adsorption isotherm
behavior for all of the products, except for SD-hexane and SD-water,
revealed their microporous nature (Figure S4). Table 1 summarizes
the results of the structure analysis. Combined with PXRD results,
these results strongly suggest that the obtained ZIF-8 possesses an
open-framework structure with sodalite topology. It was found that
intracrystalline microporosity was developed in our spray-drying-mediated
process. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas
and the micropore volumes amounted to ∼1440 m2/g
and ∼0.52 cm3/g, respectively. The experimentally
determined surface areas reported for ZIF-8 range from ca. 530 to
1700 m2/g, whereas the majority of the values are around
1200 m2/g.5,26 Therefore, the porous structure
of the ZIF-8 prepared in this study is comparable to that of conventional
ZIF-8.

Of particular interest is that the
SD-x particles converted using
alcohols have a hollow polycrystalline shape, as shown in Figures 5 and S5. The macroscopic particle size was preserved
during amorphous-to-crystal phase transition. The secondary particle
size of hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8 particles is comparable to that
of the SD-asmade particles. On the other hand, the primary crystal
sizes varied according to the kind of the organic solvent (Figure 6). In particular,
in the case of alcohols, the primary crystal size did increase with
increasing carbon chain length.

The proposed structural transition steps are as follows:
(i) penetration
and diffusion of the solvent molecules into the SD-asmade particles,
(ii) interaction between solvent molecules and water (and acetate)
coordinated with Zn, leading to coordination bond breaking and dissolution
of water and acetate in the organic solvent, (iii) interaction between
solvent molecules and 2-methylimidazole molecules, leading to re-forming
new coordination bonds and rearrangement of Zn–(2-methylimidazole),
and (iv) nucleation and crystal growth, yielding polycrystalline ZIF-8.
It is considered that highly diffusive solvent molecules for the hydrophilic
SD-asmade particles induce nucleation at a high density. The higher
the polarity and hydrogen bond donating ability of organic solvents,
the higher the nucleation density and the smaller the primary crystal
size. This crystallization process contains two competitive processes:
(1) nucleation and crystal growth and (2) the dissolution of unnecessary
components, water and acetate, for ZIF-8 formation at the interface
between the solvent and the SD-asmade particle. Such a mass transfer
from the core to the outer surface and preferential nucleation and
crystal growth near the surface of particles associated with the dissolution
process may result in the formation of a hollow superstructure.

Comparing our findings with the literature, structural transition
in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks from ZIF-L to ZIF-8 can be discussed.
ZIF-L is a two-dimensional layered structure that is composed of the
same building blocks as ZIF-8.32−34 The layers are stacked onto each
other via hydrogen bonds between free 2-methylimidazole molecules.
The close similarity between ZIF-L and ZIF-8 offered new insights
concerning the crystallization mechanisms of zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks. Low et al. demonstrated that the crystal transition of
ZIF-L to ZIF-8 occurs in ethanol.34 Their
results show that ZIF-L undergoes structural transition to form ZIF-8
upon heating at 60 °C and it takes at least 72 h for complete
structural transition. On the other hand, in our case, the SD-asmade
undergoes structural transition to form ZIF-8 at room temperature
within 10 minutes. It is believed that such an ease of structural
transition is allowed by high coordination substitution and rearrangement
abilities due to the amorphous structure of the SD-asmade.

ZIF-8
has been recognized as a unique molecular sieving material
with a flexible framework. It is interesting to note that ZIF-8 can
adsorb molecules with a kinetic diameter larger than its window size,
such as propane, butanol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (4.0 × 7.6 ×
9.1 Å3), and so on.8−10,35,36 This unexpected adsorption behavior
has been speculated to be due to the flexible apertures that swing
open by the reorientation of imidazolate linkers enforced by guest
adsorption. Our previous results revealed that such flexible functionality
and transport property of ZIF-8 are strongly affected by the crystal
size,17 suggesting a high potential for
the control of adsorption performance with crystal size. An interesting
approach is to utilize the crystal size dependency of flexible functionality
and adsorption dynamics of ZIF-8. Further studies are under way to
control the grain size of polycrystalline particles over a wide range
from nanometer to micrometer size for the development of adsorption
performance.

The above properties would make hollow polycrystalline
ZIF-8 an
attractive candidate for applications in adsorption. Herein, we discuss
the adsorption performances of the dye pollutant on the developed
hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8, SD-methanol, to demonstrate its potential
as a liquid-phase adsorbent for pollutant removal in practical environmental
remediation. We take the bulky basic dye rhodamine B (4.3 × 9.8
× 15 Å3)37 as an example
to demonstrate the enhanced adsorption performance of the macro-/microscopic
structures of hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8. Note that the apertures
of the six-membered ring of ZIF-8 are 3.4 Å. It is apparent that
the rhodamine B molecules hardly enter the pore cages through the
narrow apertures. Therefore, adsorption should occur mainly on the
external surfaces of ZIF-8.

All adsorption measurements were
performed at 25 °C. Rhodamine
B was initially dissolved in distilled water to obtain solutions with
different initial concentrations. According to the Beer–Lambert
law, the maximal absorption wavelength for the detection of rhodamine
B is 554 nm. A measure of 10 mg of SD-methanol was added to each solution
(10 mL) with agitation and maintained for enough time to reach adsorption
equilibrium. For comparison, rhombic dodecahedral ZIF-8, 12ZIF-8 (0.90
μm) (Figure S5), was also tested
as an adsorbent. On the other hand, the average secondary particle
size of SD-methanol is 3.9 μm.

Let us begin by discussing
the adsorption kinetics. Figure 7 shows the uptake curves of
rhodamine B by the ZIF-8 samples. Furthermore, it was found that the
kinetic adsorption performance of rhodamine B on the ZIF-8 samples
can be well-described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model,38,39 where qt and qeq are the transient and equilibrium adsorption amounts, respectively,
and k is the pseudo-second-order rate constant. The
constant k can thus be obtained from the intercept
of the plot t/qt against t. Figure 7 shows a good linear relationship between t/qt and t, indicating that the
kinetic adsorption behavior is well-correlated with the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model.    

Figure 7 Uptake curves (left)
and plots of the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model (right) of rhodamine B on 12ZIF-8 and SD-methanol.

The initial adsorption rate, H, can be estimated
as follows  

The initial adsorption rate of rhodamine
B on SD-methanol was determined
to be 17.2 μmol/(g·min), which is much higher than that
[2.70 μmol/(g·min)] of rhodamine B on 12ZIF-8 at the same
initial concentration of 100 μM. The higher adsorption rate
of SD-methanol demonstrated it as a better adsorbent for bulky dye
pollutant removal than 12ZIF-8, which was likely due to the limited
contact time in the water treatment processes, achieving more efficient
elimination by hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8.

The isothermal
adsorption curves revealed that the macro-/microscopic
structures of hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8 significantly structurally
enhanced the adsorption capacity of the dye pollutant (Figure 8). Surprisingly, the saturated
adsorption amount of rhodamine B on SD-methanol (285 μmol/g)
is about 20 times higher than that on 12ZIF-8 (14.7 μmol/g),
indicating relatively favorable affinity to rhodamine B for the polycrystalline
grain boundary structure compared with a monocrystalline surface structure.
Note that the only adsorption isotherm for 12ZIF-8 can be successfully
correlated with the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity, q0, and Langmuir constant, KL, were determined to be q0 = 14.7 μmol/g and KL = 10.9 L/μmol,
respectively. The high correlation is due to the adsorption behavior
used only on the external surface of 12ZIF-8 monocrystals. On the
other hand, it is suggested that the intercrystalline interfaces of
hollow polycrystals involve the multiple adsorption processes instead
of monomolecular adsorption.

Figure 8 Adsorption isotherms of rhodamine B on 12ZIF-8
and SD-methanol.
The insets show the structures of rhodamine B and part of six-ring
aperture.

Furthermore, we investigated the
vapor-phase adsorption performances
of the developed hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8, SD-methanol, as compared
with 12ZIF-8 and cubic hexahedral ZIF-8, 6ZIF-8 (0.16 μm) (Figure S5). Our approach to highlight the effect
of particle shape on intrinsic uptake kinetics is based on the selection
of a fast diffusing and apolar adsorbate, n-hexane
(a kinetic diameter of 4.3 Å). We then measured the adsorption
equilibrium data of isomeric 2,3-dimethylbutane, 2,3-DMB, coupled
with n-hexane, on SD-methanol at 25 °C.

As a result of the rotational freedom of the linkers that constitute
the ZIF-8 apertures, n-hexane is capable of being
adsorbed in the pores of ZIF-8 in spite of its kinetic diameter (4.3
Å) being larger than the aperture size of ZIF-8 (3.4 Å). Figure 9 shows that SD-methanol
adsorbs n-hexane selectively. The adsorption capacity
of n-hexane on the hollow polycrystalline ZIF-8 is
comparable to that on conventional ZIF-8.40

SD-methanol (upper). Uptake curves of n-hexane by
6ZIF-8, 12ZIF-8, and SD-methanol at P/P0 of 0.01 (lower).

Along with the elucidation of equilibrium adsorption properties,
the understanding of mass-transfer mechanisms is essential toward
the development of separation technologies. The accurate characterization
of mass transfer is, however, a very challenging task because it may
be severely affected by extracrystalline resistances, including thermal
effects and bed diffusion. In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM) technique was employed for nanogram-order resolution. We then
confirmed that the thermal effect and bed diffusion are negligible.
In addition, it was also proven that no significant mass-transfer
resistances might result from an external fluid film. Surprisingly,
despite the largest particle size (3.9 μm), the kinetic adsorption
performance of n-hexane on SD-methanol is better
than that on 12ZIF-8 (0.90 μm) and almost same as that on nanosized
6ZIF-8 (0.16 μm) (Figure 9). Besides the nanostructure control, the shaping of the adsorbent
is a key breakthrough toward the development of practical applications.

Conclusions
We describe a highly versatile and effective strategy to produce
ZIF-8 with a hollow polycrystalline structure. This method also enables
large-scale, rapid, and continuous production. The polycrystalline
structure, the crystallite size, and the grain boundary phase may
be important factors for the application in adsorption and separation.
The products developed in our spray-drying-mediated process possess
the combined architecture of the secondary agglomerates formed by
polycrystalline ZIF-8 with a controllable primary crystal size. Further,
controlling the macro-/microscopic structures of hollow polycrystalline
ZIF-8 opens new opportunities for numerous applications, including
adsorption, drug delivery, catalysis, contrast agents, and sensing
devices.

Experimental Methods
A precursor solution of 0.025
M zinc acetate and 0.05 M 2-methylimidazole
in 300 mL of distilled water was stirred and spray-dried using a two-fluid
nozzle at a feed rate of 5 mL/mim, a spray air pressure of 70 kPa,
and an inlet temperature of 150 °C, using an SD-1000 spray dryer
(Tokyo Rikakikai). The spray-dried sample referred to as SD-asmade
was then dispersed in a pure organic solvent at room temperature and
then collected by centrifugation. The immersion time in the pure organic
solvent was 20 min including centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min). The
products were then dried at 40 °C under vacuum overnight. The
resulting samples are designated as SD-x, where x denotes the organic
solvent. For reference, the product collected from the precursor solution
by centrifugation is designated as nonSD-asmade.

Conventional
ZIF-8 samples were prepared according to the literature17 for the comparison of adsorption test with SD-x.
Briefly, rhombic dodecahedral ZIF-8 (0.90 μm), referred to as
12ZIF-8, was prepared in water at a molar ratio of 1.0 zinc acetate/80
2-methylimidazole. Cubic hexahedral ZIF-8 (0.16 μm), referred
to as 6ZIF-8, was prepared in water at a molar ratio of 1.0 zinc nitrate/60
2-methylimidazole using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as a surface-specific
capping agent. The products were collected by repeated centrifugation,
washed three times with fresh methanol, and then dried at 40 °C
under vacuum overnight.

PXRD patterns were recorded on a MiniFlex
600 (Rigaku) by using
Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.5418 Å; the copper anode
was operated at 30 kV and 15 mA. FESEM images were recorded on an
S-4800 (Hitachi High-Tech). The diameters of more than 200 particles
in the FESEM images were measured to determine the average particle
size. TEM images were recorded on a JEM-2010 (JEOL) at an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured
at 77 K using a BELSORP-max (MicrotracBel, Japan). The samples were
degassed at 200 °C under vacuum. TGA was carried out with a DTG-60H
(Shimadzu) under air flow at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The
combination of TGA with MS was carried out with a TG8120 (Rigaku)/GCMS-QP2010SE
(Shimadzu) system to analyze the gases evolved during TGA analysis
under helium flow.

Liquid-phase batch adsorption experiments
were carried out by agitating
10 mg of sample in 10 mL of dye solution with different initial concentrations.
After adsorption, the dye concentration was determined using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer UV-2450 (Shimadzu). Vapor-phase adsorption experiments
were performed on an environment-controlled QCM, BELQCM (MicrotracBel,
Japan). During the measurements, the total pressure was constant at
atmospheric pressure and the adsorbate partial pressure was controlled
by independent mass flow controllers with regulating the saturator
temperature. The Au-coated QCM substrates were dipped in the ZIF-8
colloidal solution. The quantity of ZIF-8 sample was controlled by
the particle concentration of the colloidal solution. After achieving
the desired sample loading of several tens to hundred nanograms, the
sample was dried at 200 °C under helium flow. Quantitative mass
change of the sample mounted on the QCM substrate was obtained from
the frequency change according to the Sauerbrey equation.41
