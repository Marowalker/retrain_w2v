A series
of Triton surfactants with increasing number of ethylene
oxide (EO) groups were applied to investigate thermal-driven surface
flow. It was found that the thermal gradient is proportional to the
number of EO groups on the surface. This correlation leads to the
linear correlation between the surfactant structure and the driving
force of the surface flow. The friction force, in contrast, follows
a monotonic but nonlinear correlation with surfactant’s EO
groups. The results demonstrate the possibilities to manipulate the
surface flow, with potential applications in multiple-phase systems.

Introduction
The non-homogeneity
of a surface, which can be easily created through
a chemical/physical factor, can generate a surface flow.1 The surface phenomena include the well-known
Marangoni’s and Bernard’s effects.2 Despite being weaker than the bulk flow, the surface flow
can move floating objects such as an immiscible liquid drop.3 While the surface flow can be visualized at the
macroscale, such as Bernard’s effects, the molecular nature
remains unclear. However, it is generally agreed that the behavior
of molecules near the air/water surface is different to that of solid/water
during liquid flow.4 Recently, a novel
experimental study has been able to demonstrate that the surfactant
layer remains immobile in the presence of an electro-osmotic flow
underneath the surface.5 We have found
that thermal gradient on the air/water surface can generate a surfactant
flow.6 A similar study has shown that a
nanoparticle can be moved on the surface of a polymer solution via
thermal gradient.7 Furthermore, it has
been found that thermal surface gradient can deform the surface8 and bubble shape.9 The surface flow can counter gravitational drainage and stabilize
foam films in microfluidic devices.10 Collectively,
these results indicated that there is a significant friction between
the hydrophobic layer and the liquid underneath the surface. The friction
should originate from the hydrophilic attraction between surfactant
heads and the water molecules near the surface. While the surfactant
flow on the surface can vary with concentrations,11 the molecular nature of the friction force and the role
of the surfactant structure remain unclarified.

This study quantitatively
explores the molecular origins of the
phenomena by employing three Tritons with increasing hydrophilicity:
Triton X-100, X-405, and X-705 with the number of ethylene oxide (EO)
of 9.5, 35, and 55, respectively. The increasing number of EO will
quantitatively increase the hydrophilicity and EO–water bonding
of the surfactant layer. The controlled hydrophilicity of these surfactants
has been utilized in many industrial applications.12−14 The variation
in hydrophilicity expectedly results in quantifiable changes in the
friction coefficient and thus provides new insights into the molecular
nature of the surface flow.

The study consists of two interconnected
parts. First, the surface
tension (ST) of the solution was experimentally measured at different
temperatures. The results were then used to verify the relationship
between the surfactant structure and the ST–temperature gradient.
Second, the surfactant flow was experimentally monitored and modeled.
The modeling parameters were then used to deduce the molecular impact
on thermal and mechanical responses of the surfactant layer. Consequently,
the surface flow of these surfactants can provide a quantitative description
of the surfactant layer movement.

Theory
Impact of Temperature on
ST
From the literature, it
is well-known that both ST15 and H-bonds16 are linearly varied with the temperature, from
0 to 40 °C (Figure 1). In the presence of surfactants, the water–water H-bond
network near the surface is disrupted by surfactant molecules.17 In case of non-ionic Triton surfactants, the
H-bond network at the surface is dominated by the water–EO
H-bonds.18 As the temperature increases,
it is expected that the bonding network is reduced linearly as with
water–water H-bonds.

Figure 1 Influence of temperature on ST15 and
H-bonds fraction16 of water.

Mathematically, the impact of temperature on ST
will be proportional
to the number of EO 1  where ε is energy per EO group (J/mol),
Γs is the surfactant concentration at the interface
(mol/m2), and nEO is the number
of EO groups per surfactant molecules.

In this study, the slope
of dγ/dT can be
experimentally obtained for each surfactant. The data will be used
to validate the thermal linearity as well as eq 1. Subsequently, the slope will be employed
to model the ball movement.

Driving Force of the Floating Object Movement
The ball
movement was studied using a previous setup (Figure 2a).6 In this setup,
the heat source is from a thin tungsten wire, which allows a precise
one-dimensional heat transfer (Figure 2b). Once a ST gradient is generated around the ball,
the surface drives the ball toward the higher tension area. Similar
phenomena have been reported with a floating liquid droplet.3,19 In these instances, the driving force is proportional to dγ/dy, as presented in Figure 2. For a spherical solid ball,3 the driving force is given by 2  where γ(y) and Aa (mm2) are the local ST at position y and the surface area of the contacting surface between
ball and water, respectively. In the above equation, β is the
contact angle between the air/water surface and horizontal axis. The
angle is given by20 3  where θa is the contact angle
between air/water surface and the solid material and φ is the
“immersion” angle. Because the ST gradient is very small
(<1 mN/m), the contact angles, β and θa,
are assumed the same between the left- and right-hand sides of the
ball.

Figure 2 (a) Ball motion experimental setup; (b) elemental force analysis
of movement; and (c) schematic illustration of floating ball on surfactant
solution.20

Because air/water ST is linearly dependent on temperature,15,21 the local ST is associated with the local temperature 4  where A1 and A2 are surfactant-dependent
constants.

The value of A2 varies
with the molecular
nature and adsorbed concentration of the surfactants and can be determined
by eq 1.

As the
hotwire generates the uniform heat flux in all direction
on the xy-plane, the temperature gradient is given
by 5  where CT (K) is
a constant accounting for the heat transfer in the air and r is the distance from the wire. The temperature gradient
along the water surface is given by 6  where ho is the
vertical distance from the wire to surface, which remains constant
throughout the experiments.

Hence, eq 2 reduces
to 7  While Fa is the
driving force, the friction slowed down the movement of the ball.
Previously, we have validated that a “dry” friction
mechanism, in which the friction is independent on the velocity, is
applicable to the ball motion.6,22 A constant deceleration, afi (m/s2), is acting against the motion. Consequently, the
total acceleration of the ball is given as 8  where ma is the
mass of the ball and Eff is the motion
coefficient, which is defined as 9  

Hence, the motion is fully described by a system of two ordinary
differential equations and can be solved numerically via the Euler
method.6

It should be noted that Aa (m2) and β are varied with
surfactants and are determined experimentally.
The value of A2 (mN/m/K) is also determined
independently from the slope of ST-versus-temperature profile. Consequently,
the motion of the ball is experimentally monitored on different surfactant
solutions. The motion is then modeled to get corresponding values
of Eff and af. Hence, the influence of the surfactant structure on both driving
and friction forces will be examined.

Results
Influence of
the Surfactant on ST
The ST of three systems
was measured up to the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and is
presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Equilibrium ST of three Triton surfactants up to the cmc.

The data were combined with the Gibbs equation
to get Γs (as showed in Table 1) using the common procedure.23 Previously, it has been showed that below the
cmc, the surfactant
flow is controlled by both adsorption and surface gradient.11 In this study, we used twice cmc to ensure the
saturation of the surface layer. Hence, the ST at this concentration
was used for temperature analysis.

Response, and

As shown in Figure 4a, the ST of all solutions followed the linear
reduction as expected.
In the other words, A2 is a positive constant
for all surfactant solutions. In comparison to pure water, all three
Triton solutions have a lower value of A2. Furthermore, A2 is linearly correlated
with the product of ΓsnEO (as shown in Figure 4b). The results validated the linearity of eq 1.

Surface Temperature and
Bulk Convection
The thermal
images (Figure 5) indicated
a small gradient in temperature: the local temperature of the surfactant
surface near the wire was just 8 °C higher than room temperature.
It has been reported that the convection near the surface is significant
when contacting with a cool air.24 However,
when a cool water contacting a warmer air, as in our setup, the thermal
stratification was stable and no organized fluid motion was formed.25 The simulations showed that both horizontal
and vertical velocities were insignificant, even at 15 °C difference
between hot air and cool water. On our system, the maximum difference
was ∼8 °C and localized near the center. It should be
noted that the bulk water in our
system is more than 2 cm deep, comparing to 770 μm in the laser-induced
thermal surface flow (Figure 6).7

(in both cases, the wire was at the left side of the image, and the
Teflon ball moved from left to right). Recordings are in Supporting Information.

Figure 6 Thermal images of surface temperature: (a) spot temperature near
the wire position and (b) spot temperature at ∼5 mm from the
wire position.

To validate the influence
of the bulk convection on the surface
flow, the liquid motion was recorded for two scenarios: with wire
over the water surface (as in Figure 1) and wire under the water surface. These two scenarios
corresponded to the heating from the air phase and from the water
phase, respectively. For these movies, iron(II) oxides particles,
with an average diameter of ∼8 μm, were suspended in
the solution as tracers. In case 1, no organized motion was observed
until the ball started moving. Between 2 and 4 s after the ball motion,
an organized motion was observed, moving to the opposite direction
(as demonstrated in Figure 5a). As the ball sped up, from 5 to 9 s, complicated convection
was observed. In contrast, when heating under water (Figure 5b), an organized and strong
motion was clearly observed as soon as the power was turned on. The
convection was in the same direction of the ball motion throughout
the experiment. The recordings can be viewed in the Supporting Information. The observations indicated that the
surface motion was driven by the bulk convection in case of heating
from below. When heating from the air phase, the ball motion generated
a liquid flow in bulk depending on its velocity. This visual observation
confirmed our model assumption that surface flow in Figure 1 configuration was not originated
from the bulk convection.

Influence of the Surfactant on Ball Floating
Position
The equilibrium position of the ball is dependent
on the ST and contact
angle.20 For all systems in this study,
the ball always floated. However, the position changed slightly with
different surfactants (Figure 5). Qualitatively, the ball position is lower with the decreasing
length of surfactant, which decreased the air/water ST (as evidenced
in Figure 4a).

From the images, the contact radius Ra (Figure 2c) was determined
manually. Consequently, the contact angle (φ) and the contacting
area (Aa) were calculated for each of
the conditions. Consequently, the value of β was calculated
from eq 3. The value
of θa for Teflon is well-reported in the literature
as 108°.20,26,27 Furthermore, the contacting area of the submerged part of the ball
underwater, As, was also calculated and
used for quantifying the friction coefficient in the following section.
The shape parameters (Aa, As, and β) are included in Table 1 for the three surfactants, with the adsorption
and thermal parameters. These parameters were fixed in the motion
model.

Influence of the Surfactant on Ball Movement
Figure 7 exhibits ball motion
on different surfactant solutions. It is noteworthy that the motion
was faster with a higher number of EO group. However, the ball stopped as the shortest distance at the highest EO groups
(Triton X-705). The previous numerical model was applied, using Euler’s
method with a step-size of 0.03 s, to obtain Eff and af (as tabulated on Table 2). The model fitted
all three motions successfully. It can be seen that both driving and
friction forces increased with increasing hydrophilicity. The values
will be used to explore the molecular origin of the phenomena.

Discussion
To explore the molecular
nature, the values of Eff and af were evaluated against
the molecular structure of the surfactant layer. From eq 9, Eff is a function of various constants. Amongst these constants, the contact
area (Aa) and contact angle (β)
varied with the surfactants, as tabulated in Table 1. The other parameters (ma, CT, and dε/dT) are independent of the surfactant. To highlight the role
of surfactant hydrophilicity, the values of Eff/Aa/cos(β) were plotted
against ΓsnEO (Figure 8). It should be noted
that the data in Figure 8 were obtained by all modeling steps (Figures 3, 4, and 7). However, the correlation was almost linear, which indicated that the number of EO groups
is the driving factor of the motion (Figure 9).

Figure 8 Ball movement on different solutions.

Figure 9 Correlations between driving/friction factors
and the number of
EO groups.

On the other hand, the friction
is determined by the contact area
(As) and the friction coefficient between
the ball and aqueous solution. It has been demonstrated that the adhesion
force between Teflon and surfactant solutions are independent on composition
and concentration of surfactants.28 Consequently,
the friction coefficient is correlated with the viscosity of the surfactant
layer and thus is also dominated by the bonding of EO groups. In the
literature, it has been verified that the viscosity of poly-ethylene
oxide solution increased nonlinearly with the increasing number of
EO groups.29 The higher number of bonds
will increase the viscosity and friction coefficient. The viscosity-versus-molecular
length should follow a power law,30 as
with common polymers. The data of af/As are consistent with a power relationship between
bond density and viscosity.

In summary, both driving force and
friction are governed by EO
bonds and thus are functions of nEO in
the surfactant. The driving force is proportional to dγ/dT, which is a linear function of the number of EO groups
on the surface. The friction coefficient correlation with nEO follows a power-law. Qualitatively, Triton
X-705, with the highest number of EO groups, increases both driving
and friction forces. As the result, the ball moved faster but stopped
at the shortest distance. The experimental and analysis also give
a good estimation of the friction coefficient between the EO-based
surfactant layer and underneath solution.

Conclusions
The
thermal-driven surface movement was investigated with three
Tritons, with increasing number of EO groups. It was found that the
thermal gradient of ST is proportional to the hydrophilicity, which
is determined by the number of EO groups. The EO groups correspondingly
governed the surface flow, by controlling both driving and friction
forces. The driving force is proportional to the number of EO groups.
In contrast, the friction coefficient was increased, monotonically
but nonlinearly, with the number of EO groups on the surface layer.
Both correlations are consistent with the thermal and rheological
rule of EO bonding network. The results confirm the underpinning principles
of thermal-surface flow and molecular origin of the friction between
surfactant layer and liquid bulk. Furthermore, the new insights open
a possibility to optimize the surface flow via changing the surfactant
structure.

Experimental Section
Materials
Triton X-100, X-405, X-705
(70 w/w % in water),
and sodium chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A Teflon-coated
tungsten wire, with an inner diameter of 0.2 mm, was provided by SDR
Scientific, US. The Teflon ball with a diameter of 0.794 mm was purchased
from the Hobby & Engineering Supplies, Australia.

Surface Tension
The ST measurement consists of the
two parts. First, the equilibrium ST was determined by applying the
Wilhelmy plate method on a KSV Sigma 701 tensiometer (KSV Instruments
Ltd., Finland) with an automatic microdisperser.31 The adsorption density was then obtained by the Gibbs adsorption
isotherm. Second, the ST was measured at different temperatures ranging
from 20 to 40 °C by using the maximum bubble pressure method.32 Three Triton solutions with adding NaCl were
utilized in this paper.

Surface Flow
The previous setup6 was employed and is illustrated in Figure 2a. A series of Triton X solution
with twice
cmc and 3.5% NaCl were employed. A Teflon-coated tungsten wire was
then placed above the surfactant layer to generate the thermal field.
The position of the Teflon ball was tracked as a function of time
by applying the edge detection function in MATLAB.6 All experimental data were analyzed subsequently to obtain
the average fitting value and the standard deviation.

Thermal Imaging
The temperature profile of the surface
was captured via a Seek Compact Thermal camera (Seek Thermal, USA).
