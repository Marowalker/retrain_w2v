In this study, feedstock interaction
of cow manure and digested
sewage sludge on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of loblolly pine
(LP) was evaluated. Noncatalytic HTL experiments were performed at
reaction temperatures of 250, 275, and 300 °C at a constant reaction
time of 30 min. Cyclohexane and acetone were used for biocrude extraction
separately. The study focuses on the characteristics of the produced
biocrude, and thus, physicochemical properties of biocrudes were examined
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, density, and viscosity measurements, in addition
to comparing mass and energy yields. On a LP basis, the biocrude yield
reached as high as 30 and 17% for acetone and cyclohexane extraction,
respectively, at the highest reaction temperature. Elemental carbon
and energy contents increased with increasing HTL temperature for
all cases. Alkalinity of the HTL process liquid (aqueous phase) increases
from the HTL of sludge, and thus, it favored the formation of nonpolar
compounds in biocrude. On the other hand, acidity of the reaction
medium increases with the HTL of manure and pine, and thus, phenolic
compounds in biocrude were increasing. Cyclohexane was more effective
for sludge/LP biocrude extraction, whereas acetone was effective for
manure/LP. Density of cyclohexane extracted sludge/LP biocrudes at
300 °C was less than 1000 kg m–3, whereas acetone-extracted
biocrudes had densities greater than 1000 kg m–3. For all the biocrudes, viscosity was reduced considerably for the
mixtures when compared to biocrudes from LP alone.

1 Introduction
In
2007, approximately 77.6 million animal units of cattle (dairy,
beef, and other) produced 921 million metric tons of wet manure in
the US.1 Although manure application to
soil is a traditional and suitable method for manure management, it
can contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly
the release of methane.2 Furthermore, improper
management of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) can result in nutrient
runoffs that can severely affect the water quality (eutrophication
and harmful algal growth) and organisms of surrounding ecosystems.3,4 Similar to manure, hundreds of million tons of sewage sludge were
produced from wastewater treatment facilities, which raise concerns
regarding necessary handling and disposal.5 Like manure, sludge can be land-applied for beneficial use, but
increasing urbanization and increasingly stringent environmental regulations
are causing this to become a nonviable option. Alternative methods
for sludge disposal require hauling and transportation, followed by
land-filling or incineration, which leads to high costs and are considered
unsustainable practices.6 Hydrothermal
liquefaction (HTL) can utilize these abundant, wet feedstocks to produce
biocrude which can then be used as liquid fuels or additional upgraded
products.

HTL converts biomass, like sludge and manure, to biocrude
in subcritical
water, which can then be upgraded to liquid fuel.7,8 The
reaction medium for the HTL process is water at high temperature,
subcritical conditions (and water saturation pressures) ranging from
250 to 373 °C (4 to 22 bar). In addition to being an environmentally
friendly solvent, water creates a favorable reaction medium because
of its solvent properties at subcritical conditions. At the temperature
range of interest, water’s dielectric constant decreases to
values similar to organic solvents such as ethanol and n-butanol, thus making it suitable to dissolve nonpolar compounds.9,10 Additionally, acid- and base-catalyzed reactions that break down
biomass polymers occur at HTL conditions due to 2–3 orders
of magnitude increase of ionic product of water compared to ambient
conditions.11 Moisture contents of both
cow manure and sewage sludge are often higher than 80%, which is ideal
for HTL; however, there is a lack of high carbon content for higher
throughput.12,13 In contrast, woody biomass [e.g.,
loblolly pine (LP)] has a higher carbon content but contains relatively
low moisture and requires additional water for HTL.

Various
studies have been reported on biocrude yield and quality
affected by HTL reaction conditions for single feedstocks.14−16 Yin and Akhtar examined optimal reaction temperatures and times
for HTL; it was reported that generally 300–310 °C and
residence times of less than 15 min allow for maximum biocrude production
before repolymerization and condensation reactions begin to dominate
and start forming more solid char and gaseous products.14,17 Lignocellulosic feedstocks with high lignin content require higher
reaction temperatures to reach the highest biomass-to-biocrude conversion
because of lignin’s low reactivity.15 HTL has been applied to various individual lignocellulosic feedstocks.
The diversity of biomass feedstocks results in different biocrude
conversions; the varying components that make-up biomass can have
different reaction pathways that result in different conversion yields.
Overall, biomass with higher make-ups of hemicellulose and cellulose
allow for a larger biocrude conversion, whereas biomass with higher
lignin content yields lower amounts of biocrude.14,16 HTL at 280 °C and 15 min of either sawdust or rice husks yielded
approximately 8% biocrude, whereas the HTL of cattle manure at 310
°C and 15 min and that of swine manure at 300 °C and 30
min, which have 2–3 times less lignin content, reached yields
of 48.8 and 30.2%, respectively.18,19

Similar
to feedstock compositions, the yield of produced biocrude
also varies with different solvents used for biocrude extraction.
The solvent can affect biocrude yield and composition as the solvent
extracts certain compounds over others. For example, Valedez et al.
showed how certain nonpolar solvents (hexadecane, decane, hexane,
and cyclohexane) produced higher biocrude yields with lower carbon
contents, while polar solvents [methoxycyclopentane, chloroform, and
dichloromethane (DCM)] produced lower biocrude yield that had higher
fatty acid composition.20 The solvent chosen
for extraction should be taken into consideration for analysis and
not just as a means of collecting and separating biocrude.

A
review of the literature shows that less extensive research investigation
has been reported on the effects of treating mixed biomass feedstocks
under HTL conditions. Pedersen et al. recently examined the coliquefaction
of crude glycerol and aspen wood at reaction temperatures of 380,
400, and 420 °C.21 The study found
char formation was significantly reduced from 18.3% to as low as 3.42%,
which suggested that the additional glycerol aided the suppression
of lignin repolymerization, thus resulting in increased biocrude yields
(at higher mass loadings). The varying reaction temperatures did not
show a statistical significance in biocrude yield and the overall
biocrude quality. Gai et al. applied HTL to a feedstock mix of microalgae
(Chlorella pyrenoidosa) and rice husk
in an attempt to examine synergistic effects to help promote higher
rice husk conversions, as microalgae has been shown to be an excellent
feedstock for HTL.22,23 Biocrude yields of feedstock
mixtures (i.e., containing both microalgae and rice husk) were higher
than that of the HTL of only rice husks. Additionally, 300 °C
and 60 min were found to be the optimal reaction parameters for a
50:50 feedstock mixture which resulted in approximately 37.5% biocrude
yield. Pedersen et al. and Gai et al. show the potential and positive
effects that can be further studied and evaluated by treating different
mixed biomass feedstocks under HTL conditions.

Therefore, the
aim of this study was to evaluate the HTL of LP
in the presence of sewage sludge or cow manure on the characteristics
of biocrude that was produced. Manure and sludge are expected to provide
an aqueous environment required for HTL, while LP will contribute
additional carbon content. The effects of using a polar solvent versus
a nonpolar solvent for extraction were also compared.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Mass and Energy Yield of
Biocrude
Biocrude yields from different reaction temperatures
and extraction
solvents are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a,b
shows biocrude yields calculated on a dry, mass-basis using acetone
and cyclohexane as solvents, respectively. In general, biocrude yields
from acetone extraction show higher yields for manure-containing runs
than sludge-containing runs (as shown in Figure 1a). For instance, at 250 °C manure/LP
has a yield of 12.0%; at the same reaction temperature, sludge/LP
has a yield of 5.5%. Biocrude yields from cyclohexane extraction show
higher yields for sludge-containing runs than manure-containing runs
with increasing reaction temperature. Figure 1b shows that manure/LP and sludge/LP at 250
°C have yields 0.8 and 4.4%, respectively.

Figure 1 Biocrude yields from
(a) acetone extraction, (b) cyclohexane extraction,
(c) acetone extraction on a LP basis, and (d) cyclohexane on a LP
basis. Yields in (a,b) are calculated on the basis of total dry biomass.
Yields shown in (c,d) are calculated on the basis of mass of LP only
and show the contribution of biocrude from the simultaneously treated
feedstocks.

Manure-containing HTL
runs have higher biocrude yields in acetone
extraction than cyclohexane extraction, which suggests that the HTL
of manure-containing slurries contain more polar compounds because
acetone is a much more polar solvent than cyclohexane (a nonpolar
solvent). Cow manure was also HTL-treated by Theegala and Midgett
between temperatures of 250 and 300 °C for a reaction time of
15 min; yields of 16–18% were presented which corroborate manure-extracted
biocrude favoring a more polar solvent.24 A shorter residence time of 15 min indicates the varying biocrude
yields compared to 30 min residence time used in this study. Others
have shown that a longer residence time can result in biocrude having
more condensation reactions and yielding more char products, thus
decreasing biocrude yield.17,25 HTL runs involving
sludge, however, showed higher yields from cyclohexane extraction
than acetone extraction, which indicates that the reacted biomass
slurry contains more nonpolar compounds in its biocrude. Those nonpolar
compounds have higher solubility in nonpolar solvents (e.g., cyclohexane).20 This is supported by Vardon et al., who reported
a similar yield of 9.4% for digested anaerobic sludge biocrude extracted
with DCM at 300 °C and 30 min.19 Biocrude
yield from acetone extracted sludge in this study was approximately
9.0%. Both acetone and DCM are polar solvents and show that sludge
extraction, instead, favors nonpolar solvents as shown from the higher
yields.

Figure 1a also shows
the higher yield obtained from the HTL of manure and LP, when using
acetone. At 300 °C, yields of biocrude from LP alone and from
manure alone are around 11.8%. A theoretical yield (a linear average)
is expected to be 11.8% when treating the mixed feedstock if there
is no interaction between the two feedstocks, however the mixture
has a yield of 14.6%, which indicates additional interaction between
feedstocks. This can be attributed to the organic acids produced from
LP which then interact with the manure (further discussed in section 2.2). To further
observe the additional interaction that occurs when LP is mixed with
manure or sludge, biocrude yield on a basis of LP mass was calculated
and presented in Figure 1c,d. Biocrude yield on a LP basis shows how much biocrude yield is
affected with respect to LP (i.e., how much one constituent of the
treated biomass slurry mix contributes to the overall yield of the
biocrude). Yields on a LP basis were as high as 29.3% for manure/LP
with acetone extraction and 17.0% for sludge/LP with cyclohexane extraction.

Overall, the highest biocrude yields were found at 300 °C.
HTL of feedstocks with LP has yields that initially increase but show
no substantial differences for the last two reaction temperatures.
Conversely, they also stay leveled over the first two reaction temperatures
but increase for the last two reaction temperatures. For example,
manure/LP biocrude extracted with acetone remains relatively constant
at approximately 12% for 250 and 275 °C but increases to 14.6%
at 300 °C. The increase in the biocrude yield could be attributed
to the increase in the breakdown of biomass constituents. Initial
conversions of hemicellulose and cellulose into biocrude occurred
at approximately 250 °C and continued to increase with increasing
temperature.17,19 Although lignin also becomes
reactive at 250 °C and has been found to decompose vigorously
and react at 300–315 °C, it has also been shown to successively
repolymerize, which can result in decreasing yield, thus having a
conversion and yield that do not vary considerably.26

Table 1 shows the elemental compositions,
higher heating values (HHVs), and composition of biocrudes obtained
from HTL of LP, manure, sludge, sludge/LP, and manure/LP from 250
to 300 °C. The lower yields produced from the sludge/LP acetone-extracted
run and the manure cyclohexane-extracted run yielded insufficient
samples for certain analyses (e.g., HHV requires approximately 0.5
g of sample), thus they were not shown in Table 1. Elemental carbon and oxygen contents of
biocrude are considered, because the energy content of the fuel is
a function of the composition.27 Carbon
content increases with increasing HTL temperature for all samples
except those produced from manure/LP with acetone and biocrudes from
sludge with cyclohexane. The expected trend of increasing carbon content
for these two cases falls within the experimental error determined.
However, the carbon content of the mixture does not necessarily fall
within the range of manure or LP alone. This difference can similarly
be related to the organic acids produced by LP interacting with the
manure.

Hydrogen content
for samples produced with acetone changes insignificantly
with increasing temperature. The hydrogen contents were also higher
for biocrudes extracted with cyclohexane than for those extracted
with acetone, except for sludge samples which exhibited similar compositions.
Nitrogen content remains nearly constant for acetone-extracted biocrudes
except for sludge which decreased from 4.7 to 2.9% from 250 to 300
°C. Increases in nitrogen for biocrudes extracted with cyclohexane
were seen for the mixtures of manure/LP and sludge/LP. Oxygen content
decreases with increased temperature for most samples, and the oxygen
contents for biocrudes extracted with cyclohexane are lower than for
those extracted with acetone. Under HTL conditions, oxygen is expected
to be removed as CO2 during decarboxylation and as H2O during dehydration reactions.28 Manure/LP extracted with cyclohexane increased in oxygen content
from 7.6 to 8.9%. This suggests interaction between organic acids
and manure forming a greater percentage of nonpolar oxygen containing
molecules or more oxygenated compounds getting extracted from the
mixture. The oxygen content of sludge and manure biocrude was lower
than that for the digested sludge (18.9%) and swine manure (15.6%)
biocrude reported in the literature.19 Nitrogen
compositions of the manure/LP mixture in acetone were between the
levels produced from the manure and LP individually. Nitrogen compositions
of the sludge/LP mixture produced with cyclohexane were closer to
the composition of sludge biocrude than LP alone, under similar conditions.

2.2 Chemical Characterization of Biocrude Using
Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry and Fourier-Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) was used to identify compounds making up the biocrude
obtained at 300 °C (as carbon and energy contents were the highest
at this temperature) and were categorized into organic acids, alcohols,
hydrocarbons (HCs), phenols, or other compounds (Figure 2). A list of significant compounds
identified in biocrude produced from 300 °C HTL reactions can
be found in Table S1. The “others”
category consists of identified compounds with small or nonreoccurring
peak areas. Additionally, the maximum column temperature of gas chromatography
(GC) reached to 260 °C, and thus, compounds with higher boiling
points (e.g., long-chain HCs, etc.) were not identified. Physical
observations of the biocrudes showed that sludge–cyclohexane-extracted
HTL runs were less viscous than acetone-extracted HTL runs (discussed
further in section 2.3.2). Thermal decomposition and hydrolysis of macromolecules
produce monomer fragments. This is observed with the production of
organic acids (acetic acid, fatty acids, etc.) from the degradation
of fructose and glucose.29 In addition
to producing organic acids, the hydrolysis of fatty acids produces
alcohols.30Figure 2 shows that phenols and HCs were the most
produced compounds in all the biocrudes. The hydrolysis of lignin
can be considered a main source of phenols, while the decarboxylation
and hydrothermal decomposition of fatty acids have been shown to produce
HCs.31,32 Following monomer fragmentation, reformation
by dehydration and decarboxylation occurs (and polymerization for
the formation of solid chars). Varying pH of the hydrothermal medium
has been shown to result in different reaction pathways being favored
for biocrude formation.33 It should be
noted that hydrothermal treatment of LP and the hydrothermal treatment
of dairy manure had produced acidic process liquids as result of produced
organic acids, while the hydrothermal treatment of digested wastewater
sludge had become more basic.34−36 This can further explain the
more significant phenolic peak area present in the manure- or LP-containing
runs, as furfural intermediates can degrade into phenols and furfural
formation is more favored during acidic conditions.37 More HCs were detected for sludge/LP HTL runs than manure/LP
HTL runs. Watanabe et al. showed that increased alkalinity in hydrothermal
media resulted in higher fatty acid decarboxylation, which yielded
higher HC formation.38

Figure 2 Percentages of compounds
identified by GC–MS.

Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the different chemical
bonds in the various biocrudes; wavelength identification for bonds
is based on previous hydrothermal studies and HTL literature reviews.19,39,40Figure S1 shows the chemical bands for the man-LP HTL runs extracted with
acetone at all three reaction temperatures. In general, carbon and
hydrogen bands can be observed at frequencies of 2840–3000,
1510 cm–1, and various bands less than 1000 cm–1, all of which correspond to aliphatic carbon groups,
unsaturated aromatics and unsaturated aliphatic groups, and aromatic
compounds, respectively. These bands are indicative of fatty acids
and HCs, phenolic compounds detected by GC–MS. Additionally
confirmed by GC–MS, alcohols and organic acids produced are
also shown by bands at 1150, 1220, 1700, and 1350 cm–1. The increase in the reaction temperature results in higher band
intensity at 1220, 1350, 1700 cm–1 and more distinct
peak formations for bands between 700 and 800 cm–1; which suggests more alcohol, carboxylic acid, and aromatic formations
as a result of further fragment degradation. Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) plots for manure/LP runs extracted with cyclohexane
at minimum and maximum reaction temperatures are presented in Figure S2. Aliphatic, aromatic, organic acid,
and alcohol bands observed for manure/LP acetone were also observed
for manure/LP cyclohexane extraction in addition to an alkane band
at 1450 cm–1. However, the intensities for the aliphatic
bands (2840–3000, 1510 cm–1) and the aromatic
bands (bands less than 1000 cm–1) are of much higher
suggesting cyclohexane as a better solvent for the extraction of nonpolar
compounds as is also provided by the GC–MS. Figure S3 shows the FTIR plots of the sludge/LP runs at 275
°C using both solvents and the sludge/LP 300 °C run with
acetone extraction. Although the sludge/LP HTL runs in Figure S3 share the same bands as the manure/LP
runs, with respect to extraction solvent, band intensities could vary.
Sludge/LP with cyclohexane extraction has high intensities for aliphatic
groups and alkane groups. For cyclohexane extraction, the aromatic
bands (<1000 cm–1) for manure/LP are of higher
intensity than that of sludge/LP. To the author’s knowledge,
FTIR plots of biocrude produced from the HTL of these mixed feedstocks
have not been examined; however, the FTIR plots of the biocrude produced
by individual feedstocks (LP, dairy manure, and digested sludge) share
common bands for aromatics, alkanes, alcohols, and organic acids found
throughout Figures S1–S3.19,24,41

2.3 Physical
Properties of Biocrudes
2.3.1 Density
The
density of all sludge
HTL biocrudes at 300 °C are presented in Figure 3. For cyclohexane extraction, sludge/LP 300
°C had a density of 972.4 ± 16.5 kg m–3, whereas sludge-only 300 °C had a density of 903.7 kg m–3. For acetone extraction, sludge/LP 300 °C and
sludge-only 300 °C had densities of 1113.3 and 1052.5 kg m–3, respectively. Sludge/LP runs had higher bulk densities
than the sludge-only run, with respect to the extraction solvent,
which can be due to the extraction of additional compounds provided
by the LP and the higher density of woody biomass biocrudes.42 Additionally, acetone-extracted biocrudes are
shown to have higher viscosities than cyclohexane-extracted biocrudes.
Aromatics have been shown to have higher densities than HCs like alkanes
and alkenes.43 Thus, extraction of heavier
molecular weight compounds by acetone, as shown in section GC–MS/FTIR
by the increase in phenolic compounds, can result in higher density.

Figure 3 Biocrude densities of sludge-involved runs at 300 °C.

2.3.2 Viscosity
The complex viscosities
at 10 rad/s of the biocrude produced from 300 °C HTL are presented
in Figure 4. Complex
viscosity indicates the total resistance to dynamic shear, including
both viscous resistance and elastic resistance. The behavior of these
biocrudes was Newtonian or close to Newtonian. Complex viscosity is
the same as Newtonian viscosity for the samples extracted with cyclohexane,
which showed Newtonian behavior. The samples extracted with acetone
showed some shear-thinning behavior, but each reached a Newtonian
plateau by 10 rad/s.

Figure 4 Complex viscosities at 10 rad/s of the biocrude produced
from 300
°C HTL: (a) sludge-involved runs–cyclohexane extraction,
(b*) manure- and sludge-involved runs–acetone extraction, (c)
manure-involved runs–cyclohexane. (*) Manure-only biocrude
at 25 °C was not measurable, so it was portrayed as the maximum
value on the chart.

Sludge/LP biocrudes extracted
with acetone were quasi-Newtonian,
with higher complex viscosity values seen at low frequency and a greater
difference between measurements. This quasi-Newtonian behavior is
probably due to higher molecular weight and polar compounds being
extracted compared to cyclohexane, which extracts more nonpolar compounds.
These higher molecular weight substances can be entangled causing
some elastic component to the viscoelastic properties. More polar
compounds tend to have attractive interactions that increase viscosity.
The viscosity for the acetone-extracted sludge biocrude was several
orders of magnitude higher than that of the sludge and sludge/LP biocrude
extracted with cyclohexane. Even so, for sludge/LP biocrude extracted
with acetone, a Newtonian plateau appears to be reached at a frequency
of 10 rad/s.

Figure 4a shows
sludge/LP biocrude viscosity values for cyclohexane extraction. Sludge/LP
300 °C had an average viscosity at 25 °C and 10 rad/s of
0.1285 ± 0.001 Pa·s, whereas sludge-only 300 °C had
an average viscosity at 25 °C of 0.2638 ± 0.015 Pa·s.
For cyclohexane extraction, sludge/LP 300 °C had an average viscosity
at 50 °C and 10 rad/s of 0.03841 ± 0.002 Pa·s, whereas
sludge-only 300 °C had an average viscosity at 50 °C of
0.07341 ± 0.006 Pa·s. Lower viscosity at higher temperatures
is expected for any liquid, which suggests that handling of these
kinds of biocrudes may be facilitated by increasing temperature. There
was about 50% reduction in viscosity (at both temperatures) in biocrudes
obtained from the mixed sludge/LP feedstock when compared to that
for sludge-only, suggesting that mixing of biomass materials may be
a valuable technique for improving viscosity. One underlying cause
is probably the fact that the different biomass yields different molecular
weight compounds. The lower weight chains can serve as lower viscosity
lubricants for the higher molecular weight compounds. A wide molecular
weight distribution tends to lower viscosity. Another possible cause
for lower viscosity for biocrude from mixtures is that the two compounds
react during the HTL process to form lower molecular weight substances.

For acetone extraction (Figure 4b), sludge/LP 300 °C had an average viscosity
of 298.95 ± 94 Pa·s at 25 °C and 10 rad/s. The viscosity
of biocrude from sludge-only produced at 300 °C was highly viscous,
hence the viscosity could not be measured at either temperature. For
acetone extraction, LP-alone 300 °C biocrude had an average viscosity
of 5908 ± 64 and 284 ± 124 Pa·s at 10 rad/s for temperatures
of 25 and 50 °C, respectively. For acetone extraction, sludge/LP
300 °C had an average viscosity of 170 ± 36 Pa·s at
50 °C and 10 rad/s. These viscosities suggest that extraction
with acetone gives an essentially solid product. Higher handling temperatures
than 50 °C would be required for handling this biocrude as a
liquid. Nevertheless, the addition of sludge to the LP for acetone-extracted
biocrude reduced viscosity to values lower than that for LP-alone
biocrude.

The biocrudes from manure, LP, and their mixtures
were all shear-thinning
or pseudo-plastic with yield points. These biocrudes also appear to
reach a Newtonian plateau at 10 rad/s. They were found to have very
high viscosity and were essentially solid at 25 °C. For acetone
extraction (Figure 4b), manure/LP 300 °C biocrude had an average viscosity at 25
°C and 10 rad/s of 1350 ± 70 Pa·s, whereas manure-only
300 °C biocrude was solid at 25 °C. As described above,
LP-alone viscosity for these conditions was 5908 ± 64 Pa·s.
At 50 °C and 10 rad/s, for acetone extraction, manure/LP 300
°C had an average viscosity of 152 ± 18 Pa·s, whereas
manure-only 300 °C had an average viscosity at 50 °C of
4477 ± 175 Pa·s. As described above, LP-alone viscosity
for these conditions was 284 ± 124 Pa·s. As found for the
other mixtures, manure/LP 300 °C biocrude’s viscosity
was lower than that of the single component biocrudes.

For cyclohexane
extraction (Figure 4c), manure/LP 300 °C biocrude had an average viscosity
at 25 °C and 10 rad/s of 3948 ± 2483 Pa·s, whereas
manure-only 300 °C had an average viscosity at 25 °C of
8980 ± 190 Pa·s. At 50 °C and 10 rad/s, for cyclohexane
extraction, manure/LP 300 °C had an average viscosity of 7.354
± 0.61 Pa·s, whereas manure-only 300 °C had average
viscosity at 50 °C of 27.37 ± 1.49 Pa·s. The change
in viscosity was orders of magnitude lower with an increase in temperature
of 25 °C. This unusual finding suggests that future work on the
viscosity of these biocrudes and their microstructure should be pursued.
The overall finding is clear: using a mixture of manure and LP to
produce biocrude reduces viscosity considerably compared to using
manure alone. Again, this effect may be due to a greater molecular
weight distribution from the varied substances. The heterogeneous
nature of these biocrudes likely caused the differences seen between
samples. As biodiesel is expected to have a viscosity of 0.0017–0.0053
Pa·s, obviously these biocrudes will require further upgrading.8 Even so, using mixtures for HTL may be an important
first step to reducing the extent of upgrading required to produce
a low enough viscosity.

2.4 Experimental
Reproducibility
Because
of the long duration of the HTL experiments, all 30 runs were performed
once. However, because of the quantitative nature of the data presented,
insights into deviation and variance are important. Thus, an individual
run, sludge/LP run at 300 °C extracted with cyclohexane, was
performed in triplicate to examine reproducibility and deviation.
Mass and energy yields for each trial are presented in Table 2 and averaged 7.7 ± 1.2%
and 40.1 ± 1.2 MJ kg–1, respectively. For chemical
characteristics, FTIR plots of each sample produced are presented
in Figure S4 and the peak areas of pertinent
bands from those plots are presented in Table 2. The FTIR plots were not only shown to share
common peaks for each trial but also share similar peak intensities.
The same aliphatic groups, aromatic bonds, and carboxyl groups were
found in each plot. This commonality in peak consistency was further
presented by quantifying peak areas, which had low standard deviations.
Physical property consistency is shown by density in Figure 3, which averaged 972.4 ±
16.5 kg m–3. Overall, intrinsic physical and chemical
properties were found to be consistent for the runs. The nonhomogeneity
of waste feedstocks can result in the variable extraction yield. Because
of the phase separation of cyclohexane and the process liquid, mass
transfer consistency should be considered, which can be done with
additional solvent usage and better mixing/stirring mechanisms.

3 Conclusions
Physical and chemical characteristics of biocrudes produced by
the HTL of mixed feedstocks were compared to biocrudes produced by
single-feedstock HTL. Specifically, when using mixed feedstocks, HTL
of dairy manure and sewage sludge was shown to have additional interactions
with LP on the biocrudes produced. This was shown by biocrude yields
reaching as high as 30% for both acetone and cyclohexane extraction
on a basis of LP. In terms of yield and HC extraction, cyclohexane
is more effective for sludge/LP biocrude extraction. Carbon and oxygen
content reached values greater than 75% and less than 5%, respectively,
for cyclohexane-extracted sludge/LP. Carbon content reached values
higher than 80% and oxygen content reached values lower than 5%, resulting
in HHVs greater than 40 MJ kg–1. For all the biocrudes,
viscosity was reduced considerably for the mixtures, compared to biocrudes
from a single biomass. For sludge-involved feedstocks treated at 300
°C, cyclohexane-extracted biocrudes had densities of less than
1000 kg m–3, whereas acetone-extracted biocrudes
had densities greater than 1000 kg m–3 because of
the fact that cyclohexane extracted lighter molecular weight compounds
while acetone extracted heavier phenolic substances. More HCs were
detected for the sludge/LP biocrude than manure/LP biocrude for both
solvents.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Feedstocks
Three different biomass
samples were used in this study. The first was milled LP, acquired
from Alabama. The second biomass used was digested sewage sludge,
obtained from Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility (Reno, NV).
Lastly, cow manure was obtained from University of Nevada Reno’s
Agricultural Experimental Station (Reno, NV) and used. Untreated feedstock
characterization can be found in Table 3.

4.2 HTL
HTL was performed in a 1900 mL
Parr benchtop reactor—model 4520 (Moline, IL). The temperature
of the reactor was controlled using a model 4848 Parr proportional-integral-derivative
controller, and the reactor pressure was not controlled but was monitored.
Five different groups of experiments were each run at three different
temperatures of 250, 275, and 300 °C. The first three groups
of experiments consisted of base cases for the individual biomass
(LP, manure, and sludge); for each run, 68 g of dried biomass sample
was used with an additional 440 g of deionized water. The last two
groups of experiments were blends of LP with manure or sludge (50:50
mass basis); for each run, 68 g of each dried sample was used with
an additional 440 g of deionized water. Once the desired reactor temperature
was reached, it was held for 30 min, followed by reactor cooling.
After reactor cooling, the gases produced were vent-out through the
gas valves. The heating time and cooling time was approximately 30
and 20 min, respectively. Depending on which solvent was used, the
contents were filtered as described below; the solid was dried and
stored. This procedure was followed for two different solvent extractions,
so there was a total of 30 runs, 15 for each solvent.

4.3 Solvent Extraction
Each set of experiments
were performed twice: one set using acetone as the solvent for biocrude
extraction and the other using cyclohexane, to evaluate extracted
biocrude with respect to the choice of solvent.

4.3.1 Cyclohexane
Extraction
For all
the cyclohexane experiments, the contents of the reactor were mixed
with 300 mL of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade
cyclohexane (Macron Fine Chemicals) for 45 min. The solid was then
separated from the liquid using a vacuum flask with a size one Whatman
filter paper, and the liquid (cyclohexane–biocrude and water
mixture) was transferred to a separatory funnel and held for 30 min
to allow for phase separation between the cyclohexane–biocrude
and the water phase. The separated cyclohexane–biocrude nonpolar
phase was then placed in a BÜCHI RotoVap (model R-205) to distill
cyclohexane at 65 °C. The recovered biocrude was transferred
to a 20 mL glass vial with a screw cap, weighed, and stored in a cool
desiccator until further analysis.

4.3.2 Acetone
Extraction
After HTL reaction,
the solid products were separated from the liquid products in a vacuum
flask using a size 1 Whatman filter. The biocrude was then extracted
from the solid by mixing the solid with 300 mL of HPLC grade acetone
(Macron Fine Chemicals) for 45 min. Then, the solid and acetone slurry
was transferred to a vacuum flask to separate the liquid (acetone
and acetone-extracted biocrude) from the solid. Acetone was separated
from the acetone–biocrude mixture with a BÜCHI RotoVap
at 60 °C. The recovered biocrude was transferred to a 20 mL glass
vial with a screw cap, weighed, and stored in a desiccator until further
analysis.

4.4 Analytical Methods
Biocrudes produced
by the HTL of manure/LP mixture and the HTL of sludge/LP mixture were
physically and chemically characterized to evaluate the effects of
treating the mixed feedstocks.

4.4.1 Chemical Characterization
The biocrudes
were characterized by an Agilent 6890 series GC–MS equipped
with an Agilent DB5-MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm
film thickness) and an Agilent 5973 mass spectrum detector. Samples
for GC analysis were prepared by dissolving 10–50 mg of sample
in a 1.5 mL GC vial filled with 10% acetone in n-hexane
solution. Further details of the GC–MS method are provided
elsewhere.44 A Nicolet 6700 FTIR-ATR with
a SmartiTR diamond ATR (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) was also
used for spectral analysis to examine the chemical bonds in the biocrude.
Finally, elemental analysis was performed to determine the carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen compositions of the biocrude by using
a Euro EA3000 CHNS-O analyzer (Eurovector). The latter two characterizations
are similar to the methods used in previous literature.35 Fiber analysis was performed for untreated lignocellulosic
biomass and was performed using a method previously used in the literature.39

4.4.2 HHV
The HHV
of the biocrude samples
produced were measured in a Parr 1241 adiabatic oxygen bomb calorimeter
(Moline, IL) connected to a resistance temperature detector temperature-recording
probe following the ASTM D4809 method. All HHVs were reported on a
dry, ash-free basis.

4.4.3 Density Measurement
Densities of
five biocrude samples were measured in a 2 mL Corning PYREX borosilicate
glass Gay-Lussac specific gravity vial, also known as a pycnometer.
The entire vial was filled with the sample and then capped with a
capillary infused glass cork. Any sample overflowing from the capillary
was wiped off. Because of the highly viscous nature of the biocrude
samples, the vial was first filled with the sample and then placed
in an oven (at 45 °C) for 5 min to allow the sample to settle
in the bottom of the vial. Once the warm biocrude settled, the vial
would be taken out of the oven and cooled to room temperature. Additional
sample would be added, and the warming process would be repeated until
the vial and capillary were completely filled.

4.4.4 Viscosity Measurement
Viscosity
of biocrude samples was measured using a rotational/shear AR 1500ex
rheometer (TA Instruments) using a cone and plate configuration. The
rheometer was equipped with a Peltier plate for heating and a TC-202
water bath for cooling. Viscoelastic properties were studied at 25
and 50 °C in a range of 0.1–10 rad/s. Two measurements
were taken for each sample at each temperature.

4.5 Experimental Reproducibility
A reproducibility
study used by Theegala et al. was similarly conducted for the data
in the present study; sludge/LP at 300 °C extracted with cyclohexane
was performed in triplicate to examine reproducibility of certain
properties of the biocrude production.24 This specific run was chosen as it was one of the biocrudes produced
from mixed feedstocks and also provided enough sample (due to its
higher yield) for various analytical testing and characterizations.
HHV, FTIR, and density were measured and compared for each repeated
run and were performed using the same methods mentioned above.
