Velocity
and amplitude are two basic characteristics of any autowave,
and their relationship reflects the internal regulation of the autowave
system. This study proposes an approach to approximately estimate
steady velocity–amplitude (VA) relation without deriving separate
formulas for V and A. The approach
presumes constructing an ansatz which represents
the “petal” form of phase trajectory and contains V, A, and a free parameter (parameters).
After substituting this ansatz, integration of model
equations leads to a VA relation analytically. A free parameter (parameters)
can be determined by comparing the analytical VA relation to the numerical
data. As an example, we used the simplest autowave model possessing
threshold, that is, the Gray–Scott model (cubic autocatalysis
with linear inhibition) in isolated conditions with an immobilized
precursor and a diffusible reactant. For all values of the inhibition
rate constant allowing autowave solution (i.e., except approaching
zero), the free parameter of ansatz belongs to a
narrow interval has little effect on VA relation and can be regarded
as fixed. Assumption of precursor immobilization does not influence
the results qualitatively. This approach will be useful in investigations
of more complex active media systems in biochemistry, combustion,
and disease control.

1 Introduction
Active media can be generated
from coupling positive feedbacks
with mass transfer. They belong to the list of the most intriguing
themes in chemical kinetics1−4 and biology.3−7 One of the most potent ways to theoretically investigate continuous
active media systems is to use reaction–diffusion (RD) mathematical
models of the least possible complexity. Such models give insights
into the basic, qualitative properties of the system. Low-dimensional
models can be either obtained by reducing large-scale detailed ones
(usually comprising dozens of variables) or constructing phenomenologically
from known/assumed general properties and/or (bio)chemical organization
of the system. In this study, we focus on a special class of solutions
of such equations, using the term “autowave” to refer
to an active wave travelling in the form of self-sustaining pulse
(with front, top and back), to distinguish it from a travelling front
(backless).

Two basic characteristics of an autowave are velocity
and amplitude.
Generally, velocity and amplitude differently depend on parameters
of reactions and diffusion. Thus, different systems should have different
velocity–amplitude (VA) relations, and VA relation may be considered
as a characteristic of the internal regulation of the system. This
view poses the question of how VA relation can be derived from model
equations.

The specific form of kinetic terms in RD equations
(namely, nullclines’
shape, number and types of steady-states) largely determines properties
of the system and suitable investigation approaches.1−10 Nonlinearity of equations usually prevents their explicit analytical
integration except for the simplest models which have travelling front
solutions such as reduced Nagumo (or, purely cubic autocatalysis)
and Kolmogorov–Petrovskii–Piskunov–Fisher (quadratic
autocatalysis) models.1,2,5−7,10 Interestingly, in the
latter case, the explicit solution is known only for the special front
velocity.7,11 Even slightly more complex models are usually
studied numerically or approximately. Approximate solutions are acceptable
in mathematical biology and biophysics because models and their parameters
are not exact, and qualitative properties of solutions are of greater
interest.

Various analytical approaches have been developed
for obtaining
approximate solutions of RD equations and studying their properties:
narrow reaction zone method (neglecting some reaction and diffusion
terms in different space regions),1 piecewise-linear
approximation (replacing non-linear kinetic terms by some piecewise-linear
function),5−7 singular perturbation, or time/length scale separation
analysis (investigating the limits of small parameter(s) tending to
zero),4,5,8,9 using ansatz (guessing the structure
of a solution either in space or in a phase plane)2,5,7,10,11 and their combinations. In most cases, these approaches
were applied to study travelling fronts and autowaves with saturated
amplitude. So far, general methods to estimate the VA relation for
autowaves do not exist, to the best of our knowledge.

In this
article, we propose the new, to the best of our knowledge,
analytical–numerical method for estimating the VA relation
in autowave systems. The method is based on approximating the phase
trajectory of the system by an ansatz—single
smooth function rendering solutions in all space regions and containing V, A, and a free parameter (parameters).
After substituting this ansatz, integration of model
equations leads to a VA relation analytically. A free parameter (parameters)
of the ansatz can be obtained by comparing this VA
relation and direct numerical solution data. As an example, we take
the simplest autowave model with threshold properties: a two-component
system with precursor (v) conversion to the autocatalyst
(u), obeying cubic kinetics, followed by a linear
inhibition of the autocatalyst, see Scheme 1. Sometimes it is referred to as the Gray–Scott
(GS) model. We suppose that the system is isolated (i.e., the influx
of components is absent).

Scheme 1 Kinetic Scheme of the two-Component System
with Cubic Autocatalysis
and Linear Inhibition (GS Model)
Various complex systems can be studied after reducing their kinetic
scheme to the GS model.2 Examples include
glycolysis,12 catalytic chemical reactors
and cold flame propagation,1,9,13−17 fungal mycelia growth,18 and disease
spreading.19 However, available studies
in the spatial-distributed conditions are almost always limited to
open conditions,9,17−20 the dependence of autowave velocity
on parameters in isolated conditions is rarely studied,13,16 and the VA relationship in the GS model in isolated conditions has
never been reported, to the best of our knowledge. Here, we study
this relation by the proposed analytical-numerical approach which,
as we suggest, can be further adapted for more complex autowave models.

2 Description of the Model and the Analytical
Approach
2.1 Model Assumptions
We consider the
GS model (Scheme 1)
under the following assumptions:1 Geometry and boundaries: The system
is one-dimensional and isolated (there is no volume influx of components),
and boundary influence is absent or negligible.

2 Reaction kinetics: All reaction kinetics
are subjected to the law of mass action. Inhibition rate of the autocatalyst
is nonzero, so the shape of its concentration profile is pulse (see Figure 2A, thick
line).

3 Initial
conditions: Initially, the precursor
is uniformly distributed throughout the space, and the autocatalyst
is absent everywhere except the “seed” quantity localized
near one of the boundaries (for Figure 2A, near the left boundary).

4 Steady-state regime: The system has
enough time to transit to the steady travelling wave regime, and transient
process is not considered in this study.

5 Diffusion: Precursor diffusion may be
neglected as qualitatively unimportant process provided the ratio
of diffusion coefficients of precursor and autocatalyst is not large.
Actually, the main effect of precursor diffusion is some decrease
of its concentration compared to the initial finite value in front
of the autowave front (in contrast to the autocatalyst diffusion which
enables medium activation and wave propagation). The effect of this
simplification will be addressed at the end of this article (see the Discussion and Figure 4A,B). This assumption is a fortiori valid
for systems with an immobilized precursor.



2.2 Governing Equations
The standard
form of RD equations corresponding to the Scheme 1 in isolated spatially-distributed conditions
and at neglected diffusion of v, is 1  with
boundary conditions  and initial conditions  Here, u and v are concentrations of the autocatalyst and
its precursor, k and h are the activation
and inhibition
rate constants, D is the diffusion coefficient of
the autocatalyst, v0 is the initial uniform
precursor concentration, and u0(x) is the initial autocatalyst concentration, which is supposed
to be nonzero only in the small but finite spatial domain. If both u and v diffuse, the equation for v in eq 1 should
be appended by the Dv·vxx term.

The nondimensional form of eq 1 can be obtained defining t̃ = t/kv02, ũ = u/v0, ṽ = v/v0, , and h̃ = h/kv02. Omitting
tildes gives 2    

Boundary
conditions remain the same, and δ0(x) ≈ 1 in the finite spatial domain and zero elsewhere.
Here, F(u,v) = v·u2 – h·u. Note that Fu′(u = 0) = −h < 0, which
gives threshold properties to the system.8,21 Typical
solution of these equations is shown in Figure 2A. Finally, to study solutions travelling
with a steady velocity, c, that is, stationary in
the moving frame x̂ = x̃ – c·t̃ so that
(u,v)(x̃,t̃) = (u,v)(x̂), eq 2 can be rewritten as 3  

In this eigenvalue problem
for c, prime (′)
denotes the derivative with respect to x̂,
and below x̂ will be referred to as x.

2.3 VA Relation from the Homoclinic
Orbit Approximation
In this article, we suggest the following
approach to estimate
the VA relation for autowave systems that are qualitatively similar
to the GS model. Let us denote  and m = max(u) in the solution
of eq 3. In the (v,u,p) phase space, this
solution is a heteroclinic orbit connecting steady
states (1,0,0) and (v2,0,0), corresponding
to x → +∞ and x →
−∞, respectively. Projection of the orbit to the (u,p) plane is a homoclinic orbit starting
from (0,0) and returning to (0,0), see Figure 2B, for example. The homoclinic orbit intersects
the 0u axis in the point (m,0) with
the slope . If we construct the formula (ansatz) approximating the shape of the orbit and containing c and m, then after integration, we will obtain an
approximate VA relation.

(a) At x →
±∞, we have: u → 0 and vu2 ≪ hu. Thus, u approximately obeys the homogeneous equation not containing v 4  

The characteristic equation and its roots are   5  

Solution
of eq 4 is  

Thus, the orbit at
the origin has tangents (in the (u,p) plane, see straight lines in Figure 2B) 6  

(b) At 0 ≤ u ≤ m, we suggest that the ansatz approximating half-orbits
at p > 0 and p < 0 has the
form 7  so that these halves smoothly join at the
point (m,0). To do this, we need functions gi(u) with
properties 8  

The last
condition guaranties smoothness of the junction. In this
study, we use the specific form of gi(u) that fulfills all these conditions 9  

At n = 2, this equation defines an ellipse
arc
(Figure 1A). We assume
that ni > 1, and that ni may depend on h. With the above g(u) form, the
equation for v in eq 3 can be integrated     10  where v = v1 at u = m. The integral In can be taken 11  Here, , n ≡ n2, Β and Γ are beta and gamma functions, I1 = ∞, and I2 = 1. Equation 11 uniquely
binds n and In (Figure 1B, solid line). In practice, it is convenient (but not necessary)
to use a simpler approximate formula. All In values in this study are well below 10 (see Figure 3B, gray line), and for In ∈
[1,10], the following relation takes place 12  

Figure 1 (A) g(u) function (eq 9) at different n values. (B) In found
numerically from eq 11 (black solid line) and approximated by eq 12 with a = 0.15 (gray dashed line).

(Figure 1B, dashed line). The value a ≈ 0.15
was obtained by numerical minimization of the integral of the absolute
difference between In given by eqs 11 and 12 for n ∈ [n*,2], where n* ≈ 1.093 is the numerical solution
of the equation In(eq
11) = 10.

(c) Another relation between v1 and m can be found by considering the equation
for u in eq 3 13  at u = m. At this point, u′ = p =
0, v = v1, and g = 0. To find the value u″ = p′p = ∞·0, we should
calculate      

Substituting u = m and g(m) = 0 gives p′p = 0 –
λ2m·g(m)2–n, which is 0 if n < 2. Thus, eq 13 becomes the simple equality of
the inhibition and production rates   14  

(d) The c–m relation can
be found by equaling the expressions for ln v1 from u- and v-kinetics,
namely eqs 14 and 10 15     16  

This relation can be rewritten as 17  

From eqs 16 and 12, we can find In and n2 as functions of autowave
velocity and amplitude 18  

2.4 Reduced Nagumo Approximation
Another
way to analyze eq 3 is
to reduce them to a simpler model which is unique in that it has exact
analytical solution. This model is known as the cold (isothermal)
flame model,1,13 purely cubic autocatalysis model,2,10 or reduced Nagumo model.5,6 In the region of steepest
gradients, the rate of v → u reaction prevails over those of u inhibition and
diffusion, thus v + u ≈ 1.
More accurately, this first integral can be obtained by summation
equations for u and v in the limit Dv/D →
1 and h → 0. Setting v ≈
1 – u gives 19  where    

Equation 19 describes the travelling front connecting
two stable steady states, 0 and u3. This
equation can be solved explicitly by guessing that the phase trajectory
is u′ = p(u) = A·u·(u – u3).1,2,5,7,10 Substitution of this guess into eq 19 gives that , and front velocity equals to 20  

3 Results
3.1 Overall View of Numerical
Solution
The representative numerical solution of eq 2 (for h = 0.04) is shown
in Figure 2A. The autowave travels from left to right with steady
velocity and shape. The v(x) profile
has a switch-off type (thin curve), and the u(x) profile has a pulse type (thick curve). The same data in the u–p plane are shown in Figure 2B (black solid line), and solutions
at several h-values are also shown in Figure 2C (solid lines). All solutions plot nearly homoclinic orbits starting from (0,0)
to the bottom quarter-plane, intersecting the 0u axis
from below and tending to (0,0) from the top quarter-plane. Ingoing
of orbits to (0,0) ceases at low h (Figure 2C) because of finiteness of
spatial interval of numerical integration, but this region of wave
tail does not influence wave behavior, and increase of spatial interval
should make all orbits definitely homoclinic (not shown).

GS autowave model. (A) v(x) and u(x) profiles found by solving eq 2 at h =
0.04. Steady autowave velocity and amplitude are c = 0,70 and m = 0,725. From eq 5, λ1(c,h) ≈ 0,053 and λ2(c,h) ≈ −0,75, and from eq 18, In(c,m,h) ≈ 2.90 and n2(c,m,h) ≈ 1.31. (B) Same numerical
data in the u–u′ plane

±5% variation of n2 (dashed
half-orbits), and tangents given by eq 6 with the same λ1,2 (dash-dotted straight lines). (C) Numerical solutions of eq 2 at three h-values (solid lines). Analytical half-orbits (p < 0) given by eqs 7 and 9 with λ2(c,h) from eq 5 and n2(c,m,h) from eq 18 at the same h-values (dashed lines).

3.2 Comparison
of Numerical Solution and Analytical
Orbit Approximation
Surprisingly, an ansatz constructed in eqs 7 and 9 gives very good approximation of numerical
orbits for every h when parameters λi, ni, and m are varied just to get the best fit. Gray solid lines in Figure 2B show fitting example for h = 0.04,
and dash-dotted lines show tangents (eq 6). Parameters λ2 and n2 of these fittings at different h values are plotted in Figure 3A (closed
squares and closed circles). Obtained λ2 and m are close to those calculated from
numerical solutions (see gray squares vs gray lines for λ2). That is why similar
fittings were obtained when only n2 was
varied but λ2 and m were fixed to
values obtained from numerical solutions (Figure 3A, open vs closed
circles). Thus, the constructed ansatz represents
the shape of orbit well and may be used to study general properties
of the system.

bottom half-orbit λ2 (left axis, gray) and n2 (right

obtained orbits at simultaneously varying λ2, n2, and m. n2 (open circles) from varying of this
parameter solely (while λ2, eq 5, and m were taken from numerical
results). λ2 and n2 (gray and black lines) calculated by eqs 5 and 18 from the numerically
obtained c and m, which are plotted
in Figure 4. (B) In(h) and n2(h) (gray and black
lines) found from numerically obtained c and m (Figure 4) using eq 18. For comparison, n2 found by
fitting of orbits is also shown (closed circles). Rectangle shows h and In bounds used in Figure 4B to plot the analytical VA relation.

3.3 Sensitivity of the Orbit
Shape to the Parameter n2
Equations 7 and 9 mean that the
orbit trajectory at x → ±∞ and u → m is mostly linked to velocity
(through λi) and amplitude, respectively.
To check that ni influence
is localized only in the intermediate zone, two dashed half-orbits in Figure 2B show
the effect of ±5% change of the n2 value. Indeed, the effect of variation of n2 is maximal between points (0,0) and (m,0),
in the region of the steepest u(x) gradient. However, there is no any “hypersensitivity”,
as 10% change of n2 leads to ∼11%
change of |p|max.

3.4 Ansatz Shape Parameter n2 can
be Estimated from the Numerical Velocity
and Amplitude
The next aim is to obtain the ansatz shape parameter related to autowave velocity and amplitude using
model equations (rather than by orbit fitting). Numerical values of c and m in the entire range of h values are plotted in Figure 4A (solid
lines). Expectedly, the steady autowave solution only exists
at h below some threshold value, h*. We have found that h* ≈ 0.07. At h > h*, the wave does not survive irrespective
of the triggering stimulus, δ0(x), and c = m = 0 are plotted. The
same data in the c–m coordinates
are plotted in Figure 4B (bold solid line), considering h as a parameter. Because of threshold, the c–m line does not reach the origin. Assuming that the derived
analytical VA relation (eq 16) may be applied to these data, In(h) and n2(h) were found using eq 18 (Figure 3B, gray and black solid lines). The
principal difference between these n2(h) (black line) and n2 found above by simply fitting the u–u′ half-orbits (circles) is that
we derived eqs 16–18 taking into account model equations for both u and v, and that we used the computed
autowave velocity in eq 18. Half-orbits with parameters λ2 and n2 calculated from numerically obtained c and m (eqs 5 and 18) are plotted in Figure 2C (dashed lines). They do not match numerical orbits precisely but at x → +∞ and at u → m they do.

Figure 4 Numerical and analytical VA relations in the GS autowave model.
(A) Dependences of autowave amplitude and velocity in the numerical
solution of eq 2 on the
inhibition rate constant (solid lines). Results with
added vxx term to the
equation for v are plotted by dashed lines. Dotted line shows c(h) in the reduced Nagumo approximation, eq 20. (B) Same numerical data in the c–m coordinates (bold solid
and dashed lines). Thin gray lines show
the analytical c–m approximation, eq 17, with parameters: dotted line, (h,In) = (0.01,3.7); solid line, (h,In) = (0.04,2.9); dash-dotted line, (h,In) = (0.07,2.6). The
area formed by the first and the last of these (h,In) pairs is depicted
by rectangle in Figure 3B.

Obtained In(h) and n2(h) dependences are sloping quite mildly except for the region h → 0 (Figure 3B). Because at h = 0, the u(x) profile in solutions of model equations has
a shape of travelling front but not pulse, below we only consider
nonzero h values.

3.5 Analytical
VA Relation Weakly Depends on Particular
(h,In(h)) Values
Figure 3B shows that at almost all h (except h → 0), the values of In(h) and n2(h) are bounded in the narrow ranges.
For example, 2.6 ≤ In ≤ 3.7 and 1.24 ≤ n2 ≤ 1.34 at 0.01 ≤ h ≤ 0.07
(shaded rectangle). Substitution of these h and In bounds
into eq 17 gives the
narrow corridor bounded by the dotted and dash-dotted gray lines in Figure 4B, which contains almost all numerical c–m results (bold solid
line). Thus, any line passing through this corridor is an
appropriate approximation of the c–m relation in the selected range of h values.
For example, solid gray line in Figure 4B is plotted for intermediate
values (h,In(h)) = (0.04,2.9). The deviation is small
even for h → 0 (m →
1 in Figure 4B).

4 Discussion
VA relation is an important but
underestimated characteristic of
any autowave system. Usually, velocity is the only autowave property
under consideration: first, nonzero velocity shows the very possibility
of signal propagation, and its value gives the time required for a
signal to cover the distance; second, the biological system response
is usually regarded as a Yes/No (All/Nothing) type, so the precise
value of autowave amplitude looks somewhat unimportant. However, autowave
amplitude can be of major interest in various situations, such as
the following:1 The main outcome of a system is determined
by autowave amplitude. For example, in blood clotting, the thrombin
autowave leaves behind the polymerized fibrin mesh.22,23 The fate of clot (to reside competing with blood flow or to embolize
partly or wholly) depends on its physical, that is, rheological, properties
such as storage and loss shear moduli. These macroscale properties
depend on microscale characteristics of fibrin mesh (fibers’
diameters, lengths, density, branching density, and cross-linking),
which are determined mainly by the local transient thrombin concentration.24−26

2 Autowave amplitude
has great value in
the economic, humanistic, and so forth, sense. For example, it designates
the number (or fraction) of infected persons during spatial spreading
of a disease.6,19

3 The amplitude is easier to measure then
the velocity, or the velocity is too low/too large to measure it correctly.
In this case, the VA relation (like eq 17 for the GS model) can be used to estimate the velocity
from the measurements of amplitude.



In
this study, we propose an approach to investigate VA relation
in autowave systems in steady travelling regime. The key distinction
of this approach is that it does not regard derivation of separate
formulas for velocity and amplitude as functions of model parameters.
Instead, it presumes the following steps:1 Approximating the
orbit shape in the
phase space by a “petal” or “arc” nonlinear
function (ansatz), which contains wave velocity and
amplitude as well as a free parameter of orbit curvature.

2 Substituting the ansatz into model equations and integration of equations
all along the
wave front to the wave maximum; after some algebra, this gives an
analytical VA relation.

3 Calculating dependence of the curvature
parameter of the ansatz on model parameters from
the derived analytical and numerical VA relations.

4 Checking whether the curvature parameter
of ansatz has little effect on VA relation and may
be regarded as fixed.



In our study, the
free parameter, n2, and its function, In (eq 11), turned out
to be bounded within the narrow ranges for all values of the model
parameter h, allowing travelling wave solution (i.e.,
except for h → 0), see rectangle in Figure 3B. Any
(h,In(h)) pair from this range can be used in the analytical
VA formula (eq 17) to
well match the numerical results for all h (Figure 4B). This agreement
in VA relation did not require perfect matching between analytical
and numerical orbits (see Figure 2C), suggesting that the orbit shape is the “finer”
property of the system compared to the more “robust”
VA relation property.

Moreover, the orbit shape may be approximated
in numerous ways,
and the choice of the function g(u) looks arbitrary. Indeed, g(u)
in eq 9 may be multiplied
by, for example, 1 – αu2 or exp(−αu2), still fulfilling the required conditions (eq 8) but introducing an additional
free parameter, α. For the model system considered in this study,
this complication looks unnecessary. Another advantage of the chosen g(u) form (eq 9) is the integrability of In (eq 11), although this is not strictly necessary for the method, as eqs 16 and 17 contain In but
not n2. The question of the preferred
choice of g(u) functions at different
kinetic schemes will be addressed in a separate study.

Ansatz construction is a powerful but unformalized
approach to obtain approximate and exact solutions of nonlinear differential
equations.7 The idea is to “guess”
the structure of a solution basing on the knowledge of its general
properties, and to test this guess by substituting it into the model
equations. For example, the generalized Kolmogorov–Petrovskii–Piskunov–Fisher
(KPPF) equation, that is eq 19 with F = u·(1 – uq), can be solved by constructing
an ansatzu(x)
inspired by the main term of the approximate solution of the “classical”
KPPF equation having q = 1.7 Another example is suggestion of the polynomial form for the heteroclinic
phase trajectory, p(u), if the reaction
term in eq 19 is polynomial.7 For cubic kinetics, this means that the phase
trajectory can be the second order parabola, which is often used as
a “guess”, allowing an exact solution.5 However, for autocatalytic systems with two variables (Scheme 1), this approach
can only be used in case of approximately equal diffusion coefficients
and zero inhibition rate, allowing to reduce a model to one equation
(like eq 19).1,2,10,13 Thus, all that has been said above applies to the models which are
reducible to one equation and have front-like solutions. So far, there
has not been constructed an ansatz for a model with
two variables and nonzero inhibition rate of the autocatalyst.

Cubic autocatalysis with linear inhibition is a well-known model
system arising in numerous chemical and biological tasks, from flame
propagation to glycolysis. Even in the homogeneous case, this model
was shown to have “exotic” (for chemistry) properties
such as bistability and time-periodic solutions, provided there exists
a continuous influx of the first component, that is, the conditions
are open.12,14,15 After the
last articles, this model is sometimes called the GS model. The spatially
distributed GS model was studied in several articles,9,17,18,20 again in open conditions. In short, Petrov et al.17 studied regimes of autowave propagation, reflection from
boundaries, and from each other in the presence of influx of both
components; Davidson et al.18 studied fungal
mycelia growth at the continuous influx of v (replenishment
of the substrate); Hale et al.20 derived
the formula for the orbit at the large influx rate of v, equal to (v0 – v)hDv/D (in notations of eq 1); Muratov and Osipov9 used the singular
perturbation technique to estimate autowave amplitude and velocity
at the nonzero influx/removal rate, k0; and their solutions diverge at k0 →
0. Equations similar to the GS model emerged in the susceptible-infective
model with the nonlinear infection rate,19 with the only difference that the precursor influx is replaced by
the reproduction rate of susceptibles. However, in isolated conditions,
the GS model was considered only in two available studies.13,16

Novozhilov and Posvyanski theoretically studied the cold flame
propagation experimentally observed earlier by Voronkov and Semenov in the 0.03% CS2 burning in the excess of
oxygen, outside the ignition peninsula.1,13 Considering
the branched chain reaction scheme, they derived RD equations similar
to the eq 3 (but with
both components diffusible) and solved them numerically. Merkin and
Needham16 studied the same system analytically
and numerically. In both studies, solutions existed only for h < h**, and the c(h) dependences were similar to that obtained in this study
(Figure 4A, gray solid line). To make the direct comparison, the vxx term was added into the
equation for v in eq 2. Results of numerical integration of the “extended”
system are also shown in Figure 4A (dashed lines). Solution exists
for h < h** ≈ 0.045, in
agreement with h** = 0.0461113 and 0.0465.16 At the zero inhibition
rate, velocity c(h = 0) ≈
0.7 also agrees with the published results13,16 and with the reduced Nagumo approximation,  (eq 20, dotted line in Figure 4A).

Comparison
of solution with and without diffusion of v (Figure 4A,B, dashed vs solid curves) shows that diffusion
of v, at least in the range 0 ≤ Dv/D ≤ 1, affects
properties of the system quantitatively but not qualitatively: it
reduces autowave velocity and amplitude as well as h* but does not disrupt V(h), A(h), and VA relations. Novozhilov and
Posvyanski obtained similar V(h)
curves when varied the ratio D/Dv in the range 0.5–2.13 Qualitative unimportance of diffusion of v (at not very high ratio Dv/D) can be well understood as it
acts to smooth the v(x) profile:
to decrease v at the wave front (where v ≈ 1) and to increase v in the wave tail
(where v ≈ 0). Some decrease of v compared to v ≈ 1 at the wave front can
indeed decrease the velocity, but the wave tail does not influence
the system behavior. On the contrary, diffusion of u is a qualitatively important process as it brings u to the region where u ≈ 0, and the medium
is activated in front of the front (see Figure 2A, x ≳ 85). Relative
(qualitative) unimportance of v diffusion is the
main reason we neglected it in this study. Another reason is that
it makes equation for v ordinary and thus easier
to integrate. Similar simplifications are used in other systems with
low-mobile precursors, such as disease spreading (for susceptibles),6,19 predator-prey (for pray),6 resource-consumer
(for resource),7,27 and so on.

5 Numerical
Methods
To integrate eq 2 numerically,
we used the Störmer–Encke method for space discretization
(uniform mesh with N = 401 nodes, zero Neumann boundary
conditions at x = 0 and x = 100)
and the embedded Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method of order
2(3) with automatic step size control for integration in time (mixed
local error estimation with max norm, tol = 0.01, fac = 0.8, facmax
= 5).28 Increasing N and
decreasing tol had negligible influence on c and m.
