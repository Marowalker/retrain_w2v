A material design
approach was taken for the preparation of an
organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC)-polymer electrolyte material
that exhibited both good mechanical and transport properties. Previous
attempts to form this type of electrolyte material resulted in the
solvation of the OIPC by the ionomer and loss of the plastic crystal
component. Here, we prepared, in situ, a macrophase-separated OIPC-polymer
electrolyte system by adding lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI)
to a (PAMPS–N1222) ionomer. It was found that an
optimal compositional window of 40–50 mol % LiFSI exists whereby
the electrolyte conductivity suddenly increased 4 orders of magnitude
while exhibiting elastic and flexible mechanical properties. The phase
behavior and transport properties were studied using differential
scanning calorimetry and 7Li and 19F solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This is the first example
of a fabrication principle that lends itself to a wide range of promising
OIPC and ionomeric materials. Subsequent studies are required to characterize
and understand the morphology and conductive nature of these systems
and their application as electrolyte materials.

Introduction
The development of
new solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for application
in lithium ion batteries and for the next generation of high-capacity
lithium metal-based devices is currently an intense area of research.
The ability to utilize a lithium metal anode would increase the storage
capacity owing to the high theoretical capacity of lithium, 3860 mAh·g–1. However, there are many issues associated with the
reactive lithium metal surface, including dendrite formation and propagation
that can result in a fire hazard.1,2 Additionally,
the low conductivities of SPEs at practical operating temperatures
have, to date, impeded widespread SPE uptake in commercial Li ion
devices, while the mechanical properties of the SPE also need to be
considered for applications in lithium metal-based devices to impede
dendrite propagation.3,4

One avenue of material research
has focused on tethering the anion
to the polymer backbone, essentially creating an ionomer (also known
as single-ion conductor when associated with an alkali metal counterion).
With such materials, the issues with concentration polarization are
overcome, as the only mobile ion is the ion of interest. Despite having
an alkali metal transport number of unity by design (tLi+ = 1.0), ionomers typically still suffer
from poor alkali metal ion dissociation from the anionic polymer backbone,
resulting in lower ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance
when used as a single-component polymer system. To overcome this,
an ionomer block is generally coupled with an polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based
block as either a random or block copolymer to improve ion dissociation.5−10 However, the lithium ion mobility in a PEO-based single-ion conductor
is still bound to the local motion of the PEO chain, resulting in
poor ionic conductivity at temperatures below the melting point of
PEO (65 °C).5,6,9,10

Alternatively, Colby and co-workers
have recently demonstrated
that the ion motion in ionomers can be significantly enhanced by substituting
the alkali metal counterion with a bulky organic cation.11 The increase in ion motion in these systems
is mainly due to the plasticizing effect from the bulky organic cation,
effectively lowering the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the ionomer. Additionally, we have previously studied
the use of random copolymer ionomers based on 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane-sulfonate
triethylmethylammonium (N1222AMPS) and sodium vinyl sulfonate
(NaVS) monomers as solid-state Na ion conductors.12 Significant enhancement of the ionic conductivity, by 3–5
orders of magnitude, was observed when the molar fraction of N1222AMPS monomer was increased from 0 to 80–90 mol %.12 However, the Tg in
these systems remained relatively unaffected when varying the N1222AMPS mole fraction, suggesting a progressive decoupling
of the conductivity from the Tg of the
polymer as the N1222AMPS content is increased. To further
understand how the decoupling of the ion dynamics occurs in ionomers,
a series of random PAMPS-based copolymer ionomers with a lithium counterion
and different quaternary ammonium-based cations were also studied
in various molar ratios.13,14 In these studies, clear
decoupling behaviors were observed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy
for the Li-based copolymer ionomer containing a triethylammonium cation
((N1222)1–x-Lix-PAMPS).13,14 It was hypothesized
that the introduction of a bulky ammonium cation favors a Li ion hopping
transport mechanism, thereby decoupling the Li ion motion from the
polymer segmental mobility.13,14 Interestingly, the
introduction of an ether containing moiety in these Li-based copolymer
ionomers by either ammonium cation modification or the addition of
tetraglyme plasticizer induced a recoupling of the ionic conductivity
back to the polymer segmental motion.14

In parallel work, our group has previously shown that maintaining
a very high mole fraction of alkali metal salts (Li or Na) in an ionic
liquid solvent can also result in a Li ion hopping transport mechanism,
which promotes excellent lithium transport properties (tLi+ ≥ 0.4 as measured by the Bruce–Vincent
method) and good cycling performance.2,15−19

In the present work, we have studied the behavior of the N1222-PAMPS ionomer mixed with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
(LiFSI) in various molar ratios, whereby the ionomer essentially acts
as the solvent for the LiFSI salt. Figure 1 shows the chemical structure of the N1222-PAMPS ionomer and LiFSI salt. While these systems are
not considered as single-ion conductors, the aim of this study was
to investigate if a decoupling behavior could also be achieved by
the use of high lithium content in the lithium salt/ionomer system.
Two distinct regimes were observed in N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
mixtures. At low LiFSI contents, a typical salt-in-polymer behavior
was observed, where the LiFSI salt was fully solvated by the polymer
chains. At high LiFSI contents, an unexpected macrophase-separated
system was observed. The thermal behavior of these mixtures changes
drastically with the formation of a plastic crystal phase, which results
in a significant enhancement in both ionic conductivity and mechanical
properties. This behavior represents a simultaneous improvement in
both mechanical and transport properties without the use of any additional
plasticizing additives.

Results and Discussion
A series of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures were prepared
with various LiFSI molar ratios, ranging from 0 to 75 mol % LiFSI.
The SPE membranes made of the pure N1222-PAMPS ionomer
are quite brittle, limiting their implementation from a device perspective.
Increasing the LiFSI content to 40 mol % results in a drastic change
of the physical properties of the SPE membrane, going from glassy
PAMPS-like behavior to a film that is flexible, strong, and elastic.
These physical properties, which are favorable characteristics for
application in a device, were observed across an optimal compositional
window of 40–50 LiFSI mol %.

DSC measurements were performed
to characterize the phase behavior
of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI systems and better understand the
changes observed in the physical properties of the resulting SPEs.
The DSC profiles of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures shown in Figure 2a reveal some remarkable
behaviors as the composition is varied. Pure N1222-PAMPS
undergoes a glass transition at 89.9 °C, while for the 80/20
and 70/30 compositions, this Tg is increased
to 102.0 and 116.2 °C, respectively. Recently, our group reported
the synthesis and characterization of a series of random copolymer
PAMPS ionomers, varying the molar ratio of quaternary ammonium ion
to lithium ion (as the PAMPS counterion). In this study, random copolymer
ionomers based on N1222-Li-PAMPS were synthesized.14 Increasing the molar ratio of the lithium counterion
from 10 to 50 mol % resulted in an increase of Tg from 105 to 171 °C. This difference in Tg was attributed to the cation size difference, with the
larger N1222 cation suggested to disrupt to a greater extent
the polymer chain interactions. Therefore, the increase of the glass
transition temperature as LiFSI is first introduced into the N1222-PAMPS ionomer (up to 30 mol %) can be likely attributed
to the strong association of the Li ion with the sulfonate anions
of the polymer backbone, resulting in the formation of dynamic ionic
interchain cross-links.11,14 Although the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system studied here has some similarities
to the previously reported N1222-Li-PAMPS ionomer,14 it is important to note that in the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system, LiFSI also contributes a large FSI anion, which
is likely to further disrupt the polymer chain interaction and thereby
enhance ion dynamics when compared to the previously reported N1222-Li-PAMPS copolymer ionomer.14

and (b) room temperature XRD patterns of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
mixtures as a function of LiFSI molar fraction.

Interestingly, the 60/40 and 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
systems show unexpected phase behavior with the appearance of a solid–solid
transition at −9.3 and −7.8 °C (Ts-s) and a melting transition at 101.0 and 121.6
°C (Tm). As the LIFSI molar fraction
is increased from 40 to 50 mol %, both the solid–solid and
melting transitions become sharper and more pronounced. The appearance
of the solid–solid transition for the 60/40 and 50/50 compositions
suggests the formation of a macrophase-separated system with the presence
of a plastic crystal phase in the temperature range between Ts-s (e.g., −7.8 °C) and Tm (121.6 °C), which agrees with the room
temperature physical property observations. The enthalpy associated
with these transitions, as well as the temperature at which these
transitions occurs, does not match with that of the pure LiFSI salt
(solid–solid transition: 331 vs 953 J·mol–1 for LiFSI and 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system, respectively),20 suggesting that this new plastic crystal phase
is not from the LiFSI salt precipitating out. On the other hand, the
temperatures at which the solid–solid and melting transitions
are observed for the 50 mol % sample are very similar to those reported
for the pure N1222FSI organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC)
(see Figure S1). OIPCs are analogous to
ionic liquids but are in the solid state and have pliable (or plastic)
mechanical properties.21 Previous attempts
to combine both OIPC and polymer electrolyte properties into SPE have
failed primarily due to the OIPC being solvated by the polymer chains.22 To our knowledge, this is the first time that
the properties of an OIPC and polymer electrolyte have been combined
successfully to give a true OIPC–polymer electrolyte. However,
it is worth mentioning that the enthalpy associated with the melting
transition for the 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system suggests
that only ∼21% of the total mole amount of N1222FSI is macrophase separated (solid–solid transition: 5402
vs 953 J·mol–1 for N1222FSI and
50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system, respectively), indicating
that the remaining ∼79% of N1222FSI in mole is still
likely solvated within the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI ionomeric
matrix. The glass transition of the remaining N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
ionomeric matrix is not observable in the temperature range studied.
Indeed, we previously reported a glass transition temperature of 171
°C for a (N1222)0.5-Li0.5-PAMPS
random copolymer ionomer.14 An attempt
to extend the temperature range studied fails in detecting the glass
transition of the remaining N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI ionomeric
matrix of the 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system, due to the
presence of a broad exothermic peak (∼179–223 °C),
related to early decomposition processes of FSI anions20 (see Figure S2).
Interestingly, further increase of the LiFSI content to 75 mol % results
in the disappearance of the melting transition associated with the
OIPC phase, while the solid–solid transition is consequently
shifted to a lower temperature and becomes broader. Additionally,
a glass transition at 119.0 °C is now observed, suggesting that
most N1222FSI is now solvated by the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
ionomeric matrix. All of these suggest that the macrophase separation
observed in the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system is only favorable
in a compositional range of 40–50 LiFSI mol %. Table 1 summarizes both the physical
and the thermal properties of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures.

To better
understand the macrophase separation that occurs in the
N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system, XRD analysis was also performed,
and the results are presented in Figure 2b. As can be seen in Figure 2b, three diffraction peaks are observed for
the pristine N1222-PAMPS ionomer at a diffraction angle
2θ of ∼7.5, 12.8, and 17.9°, strangely characteristic
of amorphous PAMPS.23 The addition of 30
mol % of LiFSI to the N1222-PAMPS ionomer results in a
significant broadening of the diffraction peaks associated with N1222-PAMPS, likely due to the presence of LiFSI salt disrupting
the original polymer chain packing and thus promoting disorder. Interestingly,
the opposite trend is observed at 50 mol % of LiFSI, where the diffraction
peaks from the PAMPS become sharper. This coincides with the formation
of a plastic crystal phase, as suggested by the DSC results, supporting
the presence of a macrophase separation between the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI ionomeric matrix and the OIPC phase. The macrophase
separation likely results in a reduction of the total amount of N1222FSI solvated by the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI ionomeric
matrix (e.g., 79% according to DSC results), thus promoting the packing
of the polymer chains in a more ordered manner. Further increase of
the LiFSI content to 75 mol % results, this time, in a broadening
of the diffraction peaks of N1222-PAMPS, indicating again
that the macrophase separation observed in N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
system is only favorable in a compositional range of 40–50
LiFSI mol %. Both DSC and XRD data indicate that the formation of
a macrophase-separated system is likely due to the strong interactions
between the sulfonate anions of the polymer backbone and the lithium
ions from the LiFSI salt, as suggested by the progressive increase
of the glass transition for the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI compositions
when LiFSI concentration is increased from 0 to 30 mol %. Additionally,
these strong interactions also likely trigger a rearrangement of the
polymer chains in a more ordered manner (i.e., close to the pristine
polymer), as observed by the XRD data when the molar ratio between
the lithium ions and sulfonate groups of the polymer backbone is close
to unity. Further increase of the LiFSI concentration results in the
disordering of the polymer chain packing, which is not favorable for
the formation of a macrophase-separated system.

The ionic conductivity
of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures
was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine
how the ion dynamics are affected by LiFSI content. Figure 3 shows the ionic conductivity
of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures, from 30 to 110 °C.
These data, like the DSC traces, show that there is a distinct difference
in the ion dynamics of the 60/40 and 50/50 compositions compared to
the other compositions. While the conductivity of the other compositions
varies from 10–10 to 10–6 S·cm–1, these two compositions possess conductivities that
are several orders of magnitude higher, ranging from 10–6 to 10–5 S·cm–1. The higher
ionic conductivity observed for the 60/40 and 50/50 compositions coincides
with the formation of a plastic crystal phase, as suggested by DSC
data.

Figure 3 Temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
mixtures as a function of LiFSI molar fraction. Solid lines are fitted
functions based on Arrhenius equation.

To better understand the transport mechanism present in these electrolytes,
an analysis of the temperature-dependent ionic conductivity was performed
using the Arrhenius model. All N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI systems
obey an Arrhenius behavior, which is to be expected since the temperature
range studied is mostly below the glass transition temperature of
all N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI systems. The activation energy (Ea) and the pre-exponential factor (σ0) extracted from the Arrhenius fitting are summarized in Table 2. Increasing the LiFSI
concentration, from 20 to 30 mol %, results in a decrease in the activation
energy, going from 110 to 69 kJ·mol–1. For
a LiFSI concentration, ranging from 40 to 50 mol %, the activation
energy reaches a minimum of around ∼34 kJ·mol–1. This minimum in activation energy coincides with the formation
of a macrophase-separated system. Further increase of the LiFSI concentration,
from 50 to 75 mol %, results, on the contrary, in an increase of the
activation energy, going from 33 to 110 kJ·mol–1. Overall, the analysis of the activation energy as a function of
LiFSI concentration suggests that the presence of the N1222FSI plastic crystal phase (i.e., macrophase-separated system) plays
a significant role in lowering the displacement potential barrier
and thus promoting ion conduction. On the other hand, the trend of
the pre-exponential factor (σ0) as a function of
LiFSI concentration does not show any minima, but rather, follows
an exponential decay trajectory, reaching a plateau of around ∼1
S·cm–1 for LiFSI concentration above 40 mol
%. This suggests that the high ionic conductivity observed for the
macrophase-separated N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI systems, containing
40–50 mol % LiFSI, is likely not the result of an increase
in the number of charge carriers, but rather, in a change of the transport
mechanism, likely induced by the formation of a plastic crystal phase.

Although EIS gives detailed
insights into the overall ion dynamics
of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures, it does not differentiate
as to which ions are contributing to the conductivity. Therefore, 7Li and 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy experiments were performed to probe ion-specific
dynamics as a function of temperature. Figure 4 shows the 7Li and 19F NMR line widths of the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures as
a function of temperature.

Figure 4 (a) 7Li and (b) 19F static
solid-state NMR
line widths at 7.05 T as a function of temperature for the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures. The dashed lines are fitted functions based
on BPP theory (see the Experimental Section
for details).

At 20 °C, the 7Li NMR line width for the 70/30
composition is around 5 kHz, which indicates that the Li ions are
most likely immobile due to strong interactions with the sulfonate
anion of the polymer backbone. Thus, the broader line width below Tg suggests a coupling of the ion dynamics to
the macroscopic SPE dynamics.24,25 This is also consistent
with the low ionic conductivity observed for this composition, in
the order of 10–10 S·cm–1 at room temperature. At temperatures above Tg, the 7Li line width significantly decreases and
reaches 2.5 kHz at 140 °C, suggesting an increase in the Li ion
dynamics. The decrease in 7Li NMR line width starts just
before the Tg of the system, suggesting
that the Li ion dynamics are only somewhat decoupled from the polymer
segmental mobility in this composition.13,14,26

Additionally, since the 7Li NMR
line widths are in the
order of kHz over the temperature range studied, it can be assumed
that this narrowing is only due to translational dynamics (i.e., translational
jumps). A similar trend is observed in the 19F NMR line
width for this system, with a sharp decrease of the 19F
NMR line width as the temperature is increased. The onset temperature
of the 19F NMR line narrowing also occurs slightly below
the Tg of the ionomer, suggesting that
the FSI ion motions are only partially coupled to the polymer mobility.
The narrowing of the 19F NMR line width is more pronounced
than that of the 7Li NMR line width, likely due to additional
relaxation processes inherent to the FSI anion, which increase the
FSI ion mobility, such as rotational motion. Upon increasing the LiFSI
content to 50 mol %, the evolution of both the 7Li and 19F NMR line widths shows clear differences, with no sharp
decrease as the temperature is increased, but rather a relatively
linear decrease with increasing temperature. In the temperature range
studied for NMR line width measurements (i.e., from 0 to 140 °C),
only one endothermic transition at 121.6 °C, associated with
the melting of the plastic crystal phase, is observed in the DSC traces
of the 50 mol % N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system. Since no sharp
decrease in both 7Li and 19F NMR line widths
is observed around this temperature, it could be concluded that both
Li and FSI ion mobilities are not closely coupled to the dynamic of
the plastic crystal phase, likely suggesting that the Li ions are
closely associated to the sulfonate anions of the polymer backbone.
The glass transition temperature of the remaining N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI ionomeric matrix of the 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
system could not be observed by DSC, but as previously mentioned,
can be estimated from previous work to be around 170 °C,14 which is outside the temperature range studied.
Therefore, the coupling of Li ion mobility to the segmental motion
of the remaining N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI ionomeric matrix cannot
be fully probed. Further increase of the LiFSI concentration, from
50 to 75 mol %, results in a trend of the 7Li NMR line
width similar to the 30 mol % LiFSI system, suggesting a coupling
of the Li ion dynamics to the macroscopic SPE dynamics. 19F NMR line width of the 75 mol % N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI system
could not be measured due to the slow dynamics of the system.

A more in-depth analysis of the 7Li and 19F
NMR line widths was also performed using the Bloembergen, Purcell,
and Pound (BPP) model (see the Experimental section for more details).27 From this
analysis, the activation energy, EA, and
the temperature-dependent correlation time, τ, which corresponds
to the minimum energy required to induce a jump (or hop) and the inverse
of the ion jump frequency at a defined temperature, respectively,
can be determined. Table 3 also summarizes the measured EA, τ0, and some temperature-dependent τ for
70/30, 50/50 and 25/75 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
mixtures. Some degree of uncertainty is expected for these fitting
parameters as both 7Li and 19F NMR line widths
do not cover the full sigmoidal decay. However, these results obtained
can be discussed qualitatively in relative terms and compared to the
activation energy determined from the temperature-dependent ionic
conductivity.

Activation energy of 28.8 kJ·mol–1 was measured
for the Li ion dynamics in the 70/30 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
mixture. This activation energy is slightly lower than the one reported
for the random N1222-Li-PAMPS ionomer with a lithium molar
ratio of 10 mol % but still higher than those reported for traditional
Li salt/uncharged polymer systems, where EA of 34.5 and 20–23 kJ·mol–1 were measured,
respectively.13,28 The relatively high value of
the EA (30–35 kJ·mol–1) previously observed in random copolymer ionomers was attributed
to a strong association between the Li ion and the polymer sulfonate
groups and the formation of ionic aggregates. In the case of the 70/30
N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixture, the slightly lower EA could suggest that the association between the Li ion
and the polymer sulfonate groups is weaker, likely due to the presence
of the FSI ions. Interestingly, an EA of
14.0 kJ·mol–1 was measured when the LiFSI content
is increased to 50 mol %. This value is significantly lower than those
reported from either random copolymer ionomer or traditional Li salt/uncharged
polymer systems. Such low activation energy could be due to the formation
of a plastic crystal phase, as suggested by DSC results. Organic ionic
plastic crystal electrolytes are known to exhibit high ionic conductivity
due to enhanced translational motion.21,29 These translational
motions are allowed due to rotational or reorientational short-range
motions within the long-range ordered plastic phase.29 Therefore, this could suggest that the enhanced dynamics
observed for the Li ion in the 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
mixture may be due to some short-range jumps occurring within the
plastic crystal phase. At a LiFSI concentration of 75 mol %, activation
energy of 43.9 kJ·mol–1 was measured. This
increase of activation energy, going from 14 to 43.9 kJ·mol–1, when increasing LiFSI concentration from 50 to 75
mol %, coincides with the loss of the plastic crystal phase. The trend
in activation energy from the 7Li line width measurements,
with the observation of a minima at a LiFSI concentration ranging
from 40 to 50 mol %, is in agreement with the activation energy extracted
from the temperature-dependent ionic conductivity measurements.

Figure 5 shows the 7Li and 19F correlation time as a function of temperature
for the N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures. As can be seen in Figure 4, the temperature-dependent
correlation times allow us to clearly see the enhancement in ion motions
observed for the 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixture. 7Li correlation times of 4.5 and 0.9 ms were measured at 20
°C for the 70/30 and 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures,
respectively. This corresponds to a 4-fold increase in Li ion jump
frequency, when the LiFSI content is increased from 30 to 50 mol %.
Increasing LiFSI concentration to 75 mol % results in a decrease of
the 7Li correlation time to 7.0 ms. In contrast, the 19F correlation times measured at 20 °C for the 70/30
and 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures are very similar,
with a correlation time of 0.014 and 0.016 ms, respectively. Interestingly,
the 19F correlation time at a higher temperature is significantly
higher, being almost 2 orders of magnitude greater for the 50/50 N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixture when compared to the 30 mol % sample.
Overall, the 7Li and 19F correlation time results
clearly suggest that the formation of a plastic crystal phase observed
at a LiFSI content of 50 mol % significantly enhances Li translational
dynamics at room temperature, while decreasing the FSI ion translational
motion.

Conclusions
The phase behavior and
ion dynamics of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI
systems were characterized by means of DSC, EIS, and solid-state NMR
spectroscopy as a function of LiFSI concentration. Two distinct regimes
are observed in N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI mixtures. At low LiFSI
content, a characteristic salt-in-polymer regime is observed, in which
the Li mobility is only partially decoupled from the polymer segmental
motion as suggested by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. A macrophase-separated
system is observed at 40–50 mol % LiFSI, with the formation
of a plastic crystal phase, likely from the precipitation of some
amount of the N1222FSI OIPC. The presence of a plastic
crystal phase results in the enhancement of both ionic conductivity
and mechanical properties. Such improvements are unusual, as generally
both mechanical properties and ionic conductivity decrease with increasing
lithium salt content. Additionally, 7Li and 19F solid-state NMR spectroscopy shows a clear improvement of the Li
ion mobility across an optimal compositional window of 40–50
LiFSI mol %. This is the first time we have observed such a microstructure
for an OIPC–ionomer system that exhibits both promising ionic
conductivity and mechanical properties. This new type of electrolyte
material offers great scope for further optimization and investigations
using a wide range of promising candidate materials. Further studies
will focus on characterizing the microstructure of these materials
and understanding how the choice of materials can affect the relationship
between the microstructure and transport properties. The application
of these materials in battery or capacitor systems will be presented
in subsequent studies.

Experimental Section
Materials and Sample Preparation
A detailed experimental
procedure for the synthesis of N1222-PAMPS has been published
previously.26 Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
(LiFSI, ≥99.0%) was purchased from CoorsTek Fluorochemical.
Films of N1222-PAMPS:LiFSI were solvent cast from methanol
solution, which was evaporated for 1 h at 300 mbar and 40 °C
using a rotavapor. The film was then dried under a high vacuum for
72 h at 80 °C.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC measurements
were performed on a Netzsch DSC 214 Polyma instrument, which was calibrated
using cyclohexane. Approximately 8–10 mg of the prepared electrolyte
sample was tested over a temperature range of 233–423 K at
a scanning rate of 10 K·min–1. The glass transition
temperature was determined from the midpoint of the heat-capacity
change on heating.

Ionic Conductivity
Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was performed on a Solartron Modulab 1296 impedance analyzer,
equipped with a Eurotherm 2204 temperature controller. The sample
was placed between two stainless steel electrodes and then sealed
inside a custom-built barrel cell (Advanced Industrial Services, Moorabbin,
Australia). EIS measurements were performed over a temperature range
from 30 to 110 °C, in 10 °C intervals. An isothermal step
of 20 min for each temperature was used. A frequency range from 1
MHz to 1 Hz and an amplitude of 100 mV were used. Two heating scans
were conducted and the data shown in this study were extracted from
the second heating scan.

Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Spectroscopy
Solid-state NMR experiments were recorded on
a Bruker Avance III
wide-bore spectrometer at a Larmor frequency of 282.4 and 116.6 MHz
for 19F and 7Li, respectively. All 19F and 7Li spectra were referenced to trichlorofluoromethane
and a 1 M lithium chloride aqueous solution, respectively. A 5 mm
static variable-temperature NMR probe was used to record the NMR spectra.
Spectra were acquired with a single pulse experiment using a 90°
pulse length of 8.5 μs and a recycle delay of 15 s. Temperature
was calibrated using lead nitrate to an accuracy of ±2 °C.30 Reported line widths correspond to the full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) intensity of the spectral peak and were
measured as a function of temperature from 0 to 140 °C in 20
°C intervals, allowing 15 min for the sample to equilibrate at
each temperature. The correlation time, τ, was determined by
fitting the NMR line widths as a function of temperature using the
following equation  where Δν and δω0 are the line width and the rigid lattice line width in Hz.
The temperature-dependent correlation time (τ) was then fitted
with the following Arrhenius equation  where EA is the
activation energy in J·mol–1, k is the Boltzmann constant in J·K–1, τ0 is the correlation constant (i.e., the inverse of the ion
jump frequency at infinite temperature), and T is
the temperature in K.
