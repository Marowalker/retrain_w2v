Synthesis
of 50 analogues of the natural insecticide synergists,
dillapiol and sesamol, is reported. These were evaluated as potential
insecticide synergists based on their inhibition of human CYP3A4.
The most potent inhibitors have a relatively large hydrophobic substituent
at either position 5 or 6 of these molecules. For example, 5-(benzyloxy)-6-(3-phenylsulfonyl)propyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxole (18) and the diphenyl acetate
of (6,7-dimethoxybenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)propan-1-ol
(5n) show inhibitory concentrations for 50% activity
IC50 values of 0.086 and 0.2 μM, respectively. These
compounds are 106 and 46 times more potent than dillapiol whose IC50 for the inhibition of CYP3A4 is 9.2 μM. The ortho-chloro analogue (8f), whose activity
is 86 times the activity of dillapiol, is the most potent of the fourteen
5-(benzyloxy-6-(2 propenyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxoles
prepared for this study.

Introduction
In our study of Mesoamerican
and African traditional medicines,1,2 we have observed
the use of plants including the genus Piper as nontargeted adjuvant agents combined with
other targeted plant therapies. Extracts of these plants were found
to be a potent inhibitor of enzymes of metabolism including CYP3A4,
3A5, and 3A7, which suggests that they could inhibit the metabolism
at phase I of conventional drugs in vivo as well as act as pharmacoenhancers
in herbal mixtures. An active inhibitory principle of the neotropical Piper aduncum was identified as the neolignan dillapiol.
Dillapiol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4.3 Pharmacoenhancement by dillapiol was demonstrated in mice
acutely infected with Piper berghei, where we found that dillapiol has no antimalarial activity but
greatly enhanced the plasma levels and efficacy of the antimalarial
compound gedunin.4 The synergistic potential
of dillapiol combined with pyrethroids against mosquitoes had also
been described.5

Dillapiol has also
been long known as an insecticide synergist.
A recent study reported that dillapiol effectively synergized the
efficacy of pyrethrin in resistant strains of Colorado potato beetle.6 A pilot study of a small set of dillapiol analogues
with the botanical larvicide, α-terthienyl, showed that modification
of the molecule could lead to more effective synergists, but the quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models were not very
robust because of uncertainties in the LC50 (lethal concentration)
values.7

Piperonyl butoxide (PBO)
has been used as an insecticide synergist
for more than 60 years and is today by far the most commonly used
insecticide synergist. Typical databases indicate that it is a component
in more than 1500 products where the active ingredient is either a
synthetic or naturally occurring insecticide.8 The ratio of PBO to active ingredient is variable depending on the
application. It can range from 3:1 to 20:1 with the typical ratio
being 5:1. Although PBO is generally viewed as nontoxic to humans
and assigned to category IV by the US EPA, recent reports focusing
on neurological developments indicate that potential problems have
generated some concerns.8−10

The European Union has
recognized the need for improved insecticide
synergists and announced in 2013 an award of 1 million Euros to a
consortium of companies and research organizations to “develop
insecticide synergists for agricultural, household, and public health
use based on the knowledge of the interaction of PBO with metabolic
enzymes in the insect pests”.11

To gain further insight into dillapiol and its analogues as insecticide
synergists, an expanded series of dillapiol analogues have been prepared
for the present study by exploring a range of modifications of the
parent molecule. Sesamol was also used as a starting material for
the preparation of related derivatives missing one of the two methoxy
groups present in dillapiol and its analogues. All analogues were
evaluated in a CYP3A4 inhibition assay using a highly uniform and
purified cloned commercial enzyme preparation. The inhibitory concentrations
for 50% activity (IC50 values) obtained from this method
had tight confidence intervals (CIs). As the human CYP3A4 enzyme has
considerable similarity with the insect versions,12 the results from these studies should be translatable to
the application of these compounds as potential insecticide synergists.
Indeed, we have shown this to be the case.13 A number of ethers derived from sesamol which are significantly
more potent CYP3A4 inhibitors than dillapiol have been evaluated as
potential insecticide synergists of different insecticides by BASF
scientists in various locations throughout the world. The results
were sufficiently promising and have prompted a European patent application.14

Materials and Methods
CYP3A4 Inhibition Assay
Enzyme inhibition assays were
conducted with cytochrome P450-BD Gentest CYP3A4 (City, State) with
the CytoFluor 4000 fluorescence measurement system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) as described by Budzinski et al.7 Briefly, assays were performed in clear-bottom, opaque-welled,
96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) using dibenzyl
fluorescein (DBF, Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) as a substrate. Wells
were designated as either “control”, “control
blank”, “test”, or “test blank”.
Control wells consist of ddH2O and β-nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) solution; control blank wells
consist of H2O and buffer solution; test wells consist
of the dillapiol analogues at a particular concentration and NADPH
solution; and test blank wells consist of the corresponding analogue
compounds and buffer solution. Enzyme solution was added to all wells.
Fluorescence was measured at 485 nm excitation with a 20 nm bandwidth
filter. All measurements were carried out in triplicate.

Statistical
Analysis
Percent inhibition values were
calculated based on differences in fluorescence between the control/control
blank wells and test/test blank wells by the formula  where t = X and t = 0 are the reading values of the control/control
blank/test/test blank wells at the end and beginning of running X min, respectively.

The median inhibition percent
(IC50) of each analogue was determined with logarithmic
curves plotted by different concentration and percent inhibition.
The dillapiol relative inhibition activity was obtained by the formula  

As the aim of the research
was to find the analogues possessing
significantly higher CYP3A4 inhibition activity than dillapiol (positive
control), the analogues which showed more than two times the IC50 value higher than dillapiol were labeled as “/”
and no data are shown for such compounds in Tables 1 and 2. Statistical
analysis of CIs and range of IC50 values observed were
carried out using GraphPad Prism 5; these are shown in the table of
the Supporting Information.

Synthesis of Dillapiol and Sesamol Analogues
Dillapiol
was obtained via steam distillation of the fruit of P. aduncum collected in the Sarapiqui region of Costa
Rica. A typical distillation of 3 kg of fruit when steam distilled
with 3 L of water yielded between 30 and 35 g (1 to 1.2%) of essential
oil whose proton NMR indicated dillapiol with more than 95% purity.
This material was considered sufficiently pure for transformation
to the various intermediates and final products. Dillapiol can also
be isolated by steam distillation of the leaves and branches of P. aduncum; the typical yields were in the 0.3 and
0.15% range for leaves and branches, respectively. The latter materials
tended to have greater amounts of impurities relative to dillapiol
compared to that obtained from the fruit. It is well recorded in the
literature15 that the composition of the
essential oil obtained from P. aduncum varies greatly for different geographical locations. The dillapiol
content of our Costa Rican sample was as high as that obtained from
one of the samples [sample G, collected at Road Manaus-Caracarao,
km 30 (AM), 97.3%]. Our yield of oil was only 1–1.2% versus
3.0% reported by Maia et al.15 Sesamol
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as such. Standard, well-known
chemical transformations were employed to produce various analogues.

A group of 17 esters was prepared via Scheme 1. Hydroboration of dillapiol, 1, with borane-dimethyl sulfide in tetrahydrofuran gave, after reductive
workup, mainly the expected primary alcohol 2 along with
minor amounts of the secondary alcohol 3. These isomers
were separated via flash silica gel chromatography. Both isomers were
esterified with different-sized aliphatic and aromatic acids either
by reaction with the respective acid chloride or by coupling the acid
and alcohol with the help of the coupling reagent DCC. An additional
10 esters and 14 ethers were prepared starting with sesamol in order
to investigate the importance of the 4-methoxy group in dillapiol.
Sesamol, 6, was O-allylated by the reaction
with allyl bromide in the presence of potassium carbonate. The resultant
allyl ether underwent a clean Claisen rearrangement upon heating to
190 °C in decalin to give the ortho-allylated
phenol 7. Subsequent O-alkylation provided
ethers 8. Hydroboration of 8b (R = CH3) and 8d (R = CH2Ph) yielded the primary
and secondary alcohols 9 and 10, respectively.
Acylation of these gave compounds with the general formula 11 and 12, Scheme 2. All compounds were characterized by both 1H and 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry, which assured
their structure assignments (see the Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Preparation of Esters Starting with Dillapiol
Scheme 2 Preparation of Sesamol Derivatives
The above compounds were tested
in the CYP3A4 assay. The results
are presented as inhibition activity relative to dillapiol activity
= 1. The primary data set including mean IC50 values and
95% CIs for esters, 17 prepared from dillapiol and 10 from sesamol,
are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Although the raw IC50 values of 27 ester analogues showed a lower trend (i.e.,
higher inhibition) than that of dillapiol (9.2 μM), statistical
analysis revealed that only 15 analogues possessed significantly greater
CYP3A4 inhibition activity than dillapiol (df = 47,
96; F = 106.5; P < 0.05). These
are highlighted with * in these tables. For the remaining compounds, Tables 3–5, only their inhibition activity
relative to dillapiol is presented. To ensure consistency, dillapiol
was included as the standard in each set of measurements, typically
5 to 8 compounds. The IC50 value for dillapiol was consistent
in the 8.9–9.2 μM range.

Results and Discussion
Much of the impetus of this research came from an earlier observation
by our group that the tertiary alcohol 13 obtained by
condensation of the allyl anion derived by the reaction of dillapiol
with n-BuLi in THF at −78 °C with benzophenone
strongly inhibited CYP3A4.16 The synthesis
of 13 was repeated, and its CYP3A4 inhibition was found
to be 5.8 times more potent than that of dillapiol. The hydrogenolysis
product 14 and the alkene metathesis product 15 had similar potency, while the dillapiol dimer 16 was
13 times more potent than dillapiol17 (Table 3).

Both the
alcohols 2 and 3 were less potent
than dillapiol in inhibiting CYP3A4. The data in Table 1 show that for the esters derived
from the primary alcohol 2, an increase in size of the
R group, particularly if near the ester function itself, resulted
in increased CYP3A4 inhibition. For example, the acetate 4a (R = CH3) has essentially the same inhibitory effect
as dillapiol. The change in R from CH3 (4a) to nC5H11 (4d) to cyclohexyl (4e) to But(4a) resulted in increased inhibition by factors of
2.8, 3, 4, and 4.8, respectively. The benzoyl ester (4h) is 4.4 times more potent inhibitor than the methyl ester. Chlorine
substituents on the aromatic ring further increase the potency of
these compounds to statistically significant values of greater than
6 (4h, 4i, 4j). The greatest
change was observed when a hydrogen in the benzyl group (4m) was replaced by a second aromatic ring to yield R = benzhydryl
(4n, 5n). This increased inhibition by a
factor of 5 makes 4n 23 times more potent than dillapiol.
The benzhydryl ester, 5n, of the secondary alcohol 5 is twice as active as 4n (46 times dillapiol).
On the basis of this result, several other benzhydryl esters were
prepared. The esters of the secondary alcohol were more potent than
those of the isomeric primary alcohol. The benzhydryl ester 12, derived from the secondary alcohol 10 (R
= CH2Ph) (Scheme 2), gave an IC50 value of 0.16 μM making it
almost 60 times more potent than dillapiol. It is among the most potent
CYP 3A4 inhibitors reported in this study (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Benzhydryl Esters Synthesized and
Tested for CYP3A4 Inhibition, Dillapiol
= 1
Comparison of the same esters
derived from dillapiol and sesamol
suggests that the removal of the 4-methoxy group in dillapiol does
not have a significant effect on the inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme.
For example, the benzoyl esters 4g and 9a inhibit this enzyme to essentially the same extent. The same conclusion
can be drawn when one compares data for the benzhydryl esters 4n and 9f; each of these compounds is approximately
20 times as effective as dillapiol. The replacement of the 5-methoxy
group in the sesamol derivatives by benzyloxy groups (Scheme 4) (9b and 9g) lowers the inhibitory activity of these compounds by a
factor of 2–3. This is opposite to the results observed for
the corresponding 6-allyl derivatives where the benzyl ether 8c was significantly more active than the methyl ether 8b.

Scheme 4 Esters from Dillapiol and Sesamol
CYP3A4 inhibition, dillapiol
= 1.

The in vivo bioassays reported by Liu13 showed that only the highly hindered benzhydryl
esters had good
synergistic activity as anticipated by their in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition.
The less hindered esters such as the methyl ester 4a and
the benzoyl ester 4g showed no insecticide synergism
of pyrethrum against the Colorado potato beetle likely due to insect
esterase activity, which would convert these compounds back to the
inactive alcohols 2, 3, 9,
and 10. The metabolically more stable ethers, for example, 8b showed the increased in vivo synergism relative to dillapiol
expected on the basis of its increased inhibition of CYP3A4.

A series of benzylic ethers 8b–8o were prepared
from sesamol via the allylated phenol 7 (Table 5). A number of these compounds
where R is C6H13 and CH2Ph showed
modest enhancements in potency in comparison to dillapiol with the
hexyl ether showing 4.8-fold and the benzyl ether 6.8-fold increases,
respectively. Most of the other analogues had similar CYP3A4 inhibitory
activity with values ranging from 0.9 times the activity of dillapiol
for the O-methoxy derivative 8g to 8
times for the O-methyl compound 8e.
Several derivatives stood out, in particular, the O-chloro analogue 8f and the 1-naphthyl ether 8m, which inhibited CYP3A4 86 and 26 times more effectively than dillapiol.
These compounds have inhibitory activity comparable to the most potent
benzhydryl esters 5n and 11i and the sulfones 18 and 19. The benzyl ethers 8n and 8o, which have 2-methylpropenyl and 2-chloropropenyl side
chain at C6, respectively, were 15 and 12.6 times more potent inhibitors
than dillapiol, suggesting that a combination of a more hindered side
chain at C6 coupled with appropriate ortho-substitution in the 5-benzyloxy
moiety could lead to even more potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Replacement
of the benzoyl ester function in 4g by a benzyl ether
yielding 17a and 17b resulted in a decrease
of the in vitro potency (Table 4).

A group of benzylic ethers 8 were selected
by BASF
for evaluation as insecticide synergists against economically important
insects in combination with common insecticides and their potential
to be registered by Environmental Protection agencies. The initial
results are encouraging and will be reported when the evaluation is
complete.18

Conclusions
Qualitative
analysis of the inhibition data for a variety of esters
indicates that the larger acyl group attached to alcohols 4, 5, 11, and 12 gives higher
in vitro inhibition of CYP3A4. Additionally, it appears that the same
esters derived from the secondary alcohols, for example, 5n and 12, are approximately twice as potent as those
obtained from the isomeric primary alcohols, for example, 4n and 11i. In the case of ethers 8b–8o, the replacement of the remaining 5-methoxy group by other larger
substituents such as O-hexyl, O-benzyl,
in particular, several ortho-substituted benzyl analogues, and O-1-naphthyl resulted in significant increases in the inhibitory
property of these compounds relative to dillapiol.

The replacement
of the diphenylacetic acid moiety in compounds
such as 10i and 12 by a phenylsulfonyl group
resulted in the most potent CYP3A4 inhibitors we have produced thus
far with 18 and 19 (Scheme 5) having IC50 values of 0.086
and 0.13 μM, respectively. Thus, 18 is 107 times
and 19 is 70 times more potent than dillapiol as inhibitors
of this CYP 3A4 enzyme. The sulfones, unlike the esters, are not subject
to esterase metabolism in the insects and therefore more likely to
be effective in field trials.

Scheme 5 Preparation of Sulfones 18 and 19
Additional structure modifications, potentially guided
by a QSAR
developed from the available data,16,17,19 designed to enhance the potency of sesamol and dillapiol
derivatives as CYP3A4 inhibitors, in particular, various ether and
sulfone analogues, and the testing of these compounds in in vitro
and the field will be reported in the future.
