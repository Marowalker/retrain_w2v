Introduction
Most chemotherapeutic
and macromolecular anticancer drugs are designed
to interfere with cell proliferation and are inherently nondiscriminating
in nature. They nonspecifically
affect both the highly proliferative cancer cells and the normal fast-dividing
cells, leading to acute and sometimes potentially chronic side effects.1 For this reason, a class of anticancer agents
that utilize targeting moieties for their selective delivery to malignant
cells is highly desirable.2 A common strategy
involves targeting moieties that specifically bind to receptors overexpressed
on cancer cells being conjugated either directly to the drug or to
a nanoparticle (NP) drug carrier for targeted therapy. NP-based delivery
offers both the possibility of multifunctionality and higher targeting
potential via a multivalent binding process owing to tuneable ligand
density on their surface.3 In the case
of polymeric NPs, targeting ligands can be conjugated to the polymer
before emulsification or to the surface of an emulsified colloidal
polymeric NP. The latter approach is preferable because the former
alters the polymer lipophilicity and, consequently, the drug encapsulation
efficiency.4 The former method is also
susceptible to ligand entrapment within the NP core post emulsification,
resulting in insufficient availability for receptor interaction on
the cell surface.4 Indeed, the more efficient
approach of attachment onto the NP surface will permit targeting moieties
to be deposited only on the surface.5 However,
ligand attachment on colloidal NPs using conventional chemical conjugation
approaches is limited by the possibility of NP instability and aggregation.
Most of the conventional coupling strategies are nonspecific in nature.
This can lead to undesired interactions of the targeting ligand with
the NP payload (drug, imaging agent, etc.) causing loss in functionality
of either or both.6 Additionally, modification
strategies on colloidal NPs suffer from poor control of reaction yields,
difficulty in purification of NPs from byproducts, and difficulty
characterizing the resulting NP conjugates.5 Furthermore, biomolecules such as vitamins, proteins, peptides,
and antibodies are the most commonly used targeting moieties. These
molecules are sensitive to denaturation and degradation in nonphysiological
reaction conditions such as the presence of organic solvents or exposure
to heat and light, compromising their biological function and affinity
for the receptor. Additionally, they are required to be conjugated
in a particular orientation for their receptor recognition. For these
aforementioned reasons, newer and better bioconjugation approaches
such as “click” chemistry have been recently adopted.7 Click reactions are high-yielding, stereospecific,
wide in scope, and generate either no byproducts or byproducts that
can be easily removed by nonchromatographic methods.8 The processes use simple reaction conditions and a solvent-less
approach or benign solvents such as water.8 However, using click chemistry for bioconjugation reactions requires
prefunctionalization of the starting materials to make them amenable
to click reactions, resulting in a tedious multistep process.

Herein, we demonstrate the use of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA)-based
NPs as versatile platforms for facile click-assisted conjugation of
targeting ligands. In this work, the targeting ligand—folic
acid (FA)—was conjugated on colloidal PGMA NPs via two simple
steps: first, an epoxide ring-opening reaction followed by a copper-catalyzed
alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reaction, both using
only mild aqueous conditions (Scheme 1). We further demonstrate that conjugating FA to NPs
using this strategy can efficiently direct the NPs to bind selectively
to folate receptor-α (FRα)-overexpressing ovarian cancer
cells in vitro.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Reactions
(i) Propargylation of rhodamine
B-labelled PGMA NPs (RhB-PGMA NPs) using epoxide ring-opening reaction
and (ii) the CuAAC click reaction, leading to the synthesis of fluorescent
folic acid-functionalized PGMA NPs (FA-RhB-PGMA NPs).

FA was chosen as a model system in the present study because
it
is an essential vitamin that plays a central role in DNA synthesis,
repair, and methylation; therefore, the proliferation and maintenance
of all cells.9 FRs are upregulated in cancer
cells, resulting in elevated receptor-mediated uptake of FA. This
in turn enables highly proliferating malignant cells to compete more
aggressively for the vitamin.10 Importantly,
the FRα isoform is well known to have elevated levels of expression
in various human malignancies of the epithelial lineage, particularly
in 82% of ovarian cancers.11 The high nanomolar
affinity of FA for FRα12 (Kd < 10–9 M) along with
relatively high storage, stability, availability, cost effectiveness,
and ease of chemical attachment and characterization makes FA a pertinent
ligand for conjugation. For this reason, a large number of FA-functionalized
polymeric NPs for application in tumor-targeted therapy and imaging
have previously been reported.13

Recent determination of the crystal structure of the human FRα
in complex with FA confirms that the carboxylate groups in FA are
the optimal regions for its conjugation to NPs without affecting its
receptor affinity.14 In addition, the greatest
degree of FR binding has been noted for an optimal FA surface density
on NPs compared with higher or lower density variants.15 A carbodiimide reaction [N-hydroxysuccinamide/N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (NHS/DCC)]
that facilitates condensation of amino and carboxylic groups giving
rise to a stable amide linkage is the most commonly used methodology
for FA conjugation to the aforementioned polymeric NPs.4 This approach has its drawbacks, which include
difficulty in purification from byproducts and multistep isolation,
leading to NP agglomeration. Overall, this process results in poor
control of the ligand density and low ligand-binding efficiency on
the NPs.4,16 Herein, we propose the utility of colloidal
PGMA for facile click-assisted ligand conjugation.

Results and Discussion
The reactive epoxide functionalities make PGMA a very versatile
polymer that is ideal for both synthesis of NPs and their facile modification.
The PGMA NPs were synthesized using an oil-in-water emulsification
process (Supporting Information). The polymer
was modified with a fluorescent dye, rhodamine B (RhB), using a previously
reported procedure to render the colloidal system suitable for fluorescence
imaging in vitro.17 The attachment occurred
via an epoxide ring-opening reaction between the freely available
carboxyl group on RhB and the epoxide group on PGMA, which was confirmed
using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrometry (Supporting Information).17 To make the NPs amenable to the CuAAC click reaction, it is necessary
to functionalize the polymer either with an azide or alkyne functionality.
Herein, the presence of epoxide groups in PGMA facilitated the introduction
of terminal alkyne functionalities on NPs via a single-step nucleophilic
substitution ring-opening reaction with propargylamine [Scheme 1(i)]. Alternatively, the surface
of an assembled NP can be azide-functionalized for the CuAAC reaction
with alkyne-functionalized FA.18 However,
to minimize the possibility of alkyne homocoupling side reactions,19 a sterically bulkier base, that is, the NP surface,
was preferred for the introduction of the alkyne functionality in
this work. Excess propargylamine was washed with water, yielding propargylated
fluorescent PGMA NPs (Prop-RhB-PGMA NPs). The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrum for rhodamine-labelled PGMA NPs (Figure 1a) shows characteristic absorption
bands for symmetric and asymmetric epoxide ring () deformations at 908 and
847 cm–1, respectively. Propargylamine has the characteristic
C–H bend (−C≡C–H) peak at 636 cm–1 (Figure 1b). A corresponding
band at 652 cm–1 appeared as shown in Figure 1c, confirming the introduction
of a terminal alkyne on the polymer. Conversely, the bands at 908
and 847 cm–1 were distinctly reduced in intensity
upon propargylamine attachment (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of (a) RhB-PGMA NPs, (b) propargylamine,
(c) Prop-RhB-PGMA
NPs, (d) azido-folic acid, and (e) FA-RhB-PGMA NPs.

An azide functionality was introduced in FA according
to a previously
reported method.20 Briefly, this involved
a carbodiimide cross-linking reaction with the formation of an NHS
ester of FA, followed by the addition of 3-azido-1-propylamine. The
primary amine on 3-azido-1-propylamine coupled with the activated
glutamate moiety on FA produced the desired azido-folic acid product
in 72% yield. The final product was confirmed using FTIR (Figure 1d) and proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) (Supporting Information) spectra.

The azide-functionalized FA was
attached to the colloidal surface
using the CuAAC click reaction. The reaction was performed under an
atmosphere of argon under weakly basic conditions (NH4HCO3 buffer, 10 mM, pH 8.0) at room temperature for 12 h [Scheme 1(ii)]. These conditions
are advantageous in maintaining the biological activity of FA because
it is sensitive to heat, light, and acidic pH. The copper(I)-catalyst
was generated in situ by reducing copper(II)-sulphate using a freshly
prepared sodium l-ascorbate solution. Post reaction, NPs
were extensively washed to remove unreacted azido-folic acid and further
dialyzed to remove the trace amounts of copper. Successful conjugation
of the FA moiety onto NPs was confirmed using FTIR spectroscopy, wherein
a new peak appeared at 1607 cm–1 (Figure 1e) corresponding to the −C=N–
stretch of the 1, 2, 3 triazole ring, formed as a result of the CuAAC
cycloaddition. Furthermore, the peak corresponding to the azide functionality
(−N=N+=N–) at 2100
cm–1 appearing in Figure 1d was absent in Figure 1e, indicating the absence of any reactant
residue. However, a residual peak for free terminal alkyne groups
(652 cm–1) in Figure 1e indicates incomplete reaction that could either be
due to the early termination of reaction or the steric hindrance between
FA functionalities on the NP surface. FA attachment to the NPs was
also confirmed using UV–vis absorption spectra of FA-RhB-PGMA
NPs containing characteristic peaks for both FA and RhB at 358 and
564 nm, respectively (Supporting Information).

Synthesis and purification of RhB-PGMA and FA-RhB-PGMA NPs
were
followed by their physicochemical characterizations. As shown in Figure 2a, analysis of the
average hydrodynamic diameter of NPs revealed a shift from 193 nm
[polydispersity index (PDI): 0.074] to 223 nm (PDI: 0.121) following
FA attachment. This ∼20 nm increase in the average hydrodynamic
diameter could presumably result both from the presence of an additional
FA layer on the NPs and importantly from the resultant more solvated
NP surface. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 2b) suggests a spherical
morphology for FA-RhB-PGMA NPs. The zeta potential for the NPs changed
at each of the two steps leading to FA conjugation. Interestingly,
there was an increase in the surface potential from near-neutral to
+29.4 mV on attachment of neutral alkyne functionalities (propargylation)
on the NPs. This reversed to a final negative surface charge (−33.4
mV) on FA-RhB-PGMA NPs (Figure 2c), confirming the presence of an anionic layer of FA on NPs
at physiological pH and suggesting colloidal stability.21 The amount of FA attached to the NPs calculated
using UV–vis spectrometry was found to be 14.8% (w/w) (Supporting Information). FA density on NPs can
potentially be optimized in future by varying the reaction parameters
and studying the effect of ligand density on their uptake in target
cells.

100 μg/mL in (d) SKOV-3, (e) HAL-15, and (f) A549 cells following
a 72 h incubation period.

Following the synthesis and physicochemical characterizations,
the toxicity of the NPs was assessed in both human cancer and normal
human cell lines. Briefly, three different cell lines—(1) HAL-15,
primary cells from human liver, (2) SKOV-3, ovarian cancer cells,
and (3) A549, lung adenocarcinoma cells—were incubated for
72 h with RhB-PGMA and FA-RhB-PGMA NPs in cell-culture media at the
NP concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μg/mL. Cell viability was
tested using an MTS assay. As shown in Figure 2d, neither RhB-PGMA nor FA-RhB-PGMA NPs displayed
any significant toxicity [analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s
post hoc, p > 0.05, n = 3] in
SKOV-3
(Figure 2d), HAL-15
(Figure 2e), and A549
cell lines (Figure 2f).

Before assessing the active targeting capability of FA-RhB-PGMA
NPs for ovarian cancer cells, the relative overexpression of FRα
on the chosen SKOV-3 cell line was confirmed. A flow cytometric analysis
of FRα expression (Supporting Information) showed that the receptor was overexpressed in the SKOV-3 cell line
relative to A549 and HAL-15 cells. The targeting ability of FA-RhB-PGMA
NPs was confirmed in vitro using fluorescence confocal laser scanning
microscopy. Briefly, FRα-overexpressing SKOV-3 cells and FRα-deficient
A549 cells were incubated with fresh cell culture media containing
either 10 μg/mL RhB-PGMA NPs or 10 μg/mL FA-RhB-PGMA NPs.
After a 12 h incubation period, the cell samples were fixed and stained
for α-tubulin and cell nuclei followed by microscopic analysis. Figure 3 shows the extent
of cellular uptake of FA-conjugated and unconjugated NPs (NPs stained
red for RhB) in FRα-overexpressing SKOV-3 cells and FRα-deficient
A549 cells.

Figure 3 NP uptake in FRα-overexpressing and FRα-deficient cell
lines. (a) RhB-PGMA NPs and (b) FA-RhB-PGMA NPs uptake in SKOV-3 (top)
and A549 (bottom) cells (scale bar, 100 μm; on the left, images
of cells stained green for α-tubulin, and on the right, images
of cells with cell nuclei stained blue and NPs fluoresce red due to
the presence of RhB).

The cellular uptake profiles of RhB-PGMA NPs suggest that
both
SKOV-3 and A549 cells are capable of internalizing a small amount
of NPs via non-FRα-directed mechanisms (Figure 3a). However, there is a clear positive correlation
between the presence of FA on NPs and their higher uptake in FRα-overexpressing
SKOV-3 cells (Figure 3b). On the other hand, NP uptake in A549 cells remains unaffected
by FA conjugation, which suggests that the enhanced uptake of FA-RhB-PGMA
NPs in SKOV-3 can be attributed to the FRα-mediated uptake mechanism.

Conclusions
We report PGMA NPs as a colloidal polymeric platform for facile
click chemistry-assisted ligand functionalization and receptor targeting.
FA attachment on PGMA NPs was performed using a clean two-step process
wherein only an aqueous solvent and ambient conditions were required
and no side products were generated. The presence of a large amount
of epoxide functionality on PGMA NPs facilitated a single-step prefunctionalization
of NPs, making them amenable to click-facilitated attachment of FA
in the second step. The resultant biocompatible FRα-targeted
NPs demonstrated active targeting capability by enhanced accumulation
in ovarian cancer cells in vitro, thereby confirming an orientation-controlled
attachment of the targeting ligand using this approach.

Materials
PGMA
(Mn = 220 515
g/mol, Mw = 433 730 g/mol, PDI
= 1.97) was a generous gift from Prof. Igor Luzinov and Dr. Yuriy
Galabura (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Clemson University,
Clemson, SC, USA). RhB (>95%, Kodak), ethyl methyl ketone (MEK)
(>99%,
Sigma Aldrich), chloroform (>99%, Chem-Supply), propargylamine
(>99.8%,
Sigma Aldrich), Pluronic F108 (Sigma Aldrich), 3-azido-1-propylamine
(>99.7%, Alfa Aesar), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99%, Sigma
Aldrich),
FA (>97%, Sigma Aldrich), DMSO-d6 (99.9%,
Sigma Aldrich), NH4HCO3 (>99%, Sigma Aldrich), l-sodium ascorbate (>98%, Sigma Aldrich), CuSO4·5H2O (>98%, Chem-Supply), NHS (98%, Sigma Aldrich),
and DCC (≥98%,
Sigma Aldrich) were all used as received.

Synthesis of Fluorescent
PGMA NPs (RhB-PGMA NPs)
A
solution of RhB (20 mg) and PGMA (100 mg) in MEK (50 mL) was heated
at 70 °C for 5 h. This solution was then reduced in vacuo. The
resultant RhB–PGMA polymer was precipitated in diethyl ether
and washed three times with ether to remove ungrafted RhB. The polymer
was then dried and weighed. For NP synthesis, RhB–PGMA (100
mg) was dissolved in a 1:3 mixture of CHCl3 and MEK (8
mL) to make up the organic phase. NPs were prepared by nonspontaneous
emulsification of the organic phase in an aqueous solution of Pluronic
F108 (1.25% w/v, 60 mL). The emulsion was homogenized using a probe-type
ultrasonicator for 1 min at low power. Organic solvents were allowed
to evaporate under a slow flow of N2(g) with stirring at
125 rpm overnight. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 3000g for 30 min to remove the excess polymer. The supernatant
was collected and centrifuged at 20 000g for
30 min to collect the NPs, which were resuspended in 10 mL of Pluronic
solution (0.125% w/v) for storage till further use. The equivalent
dry mass of NPs was determined following freeze-drying of a known
volume of NP suspension.

Synthesis of Propargylated NPs (Prop-RhB-PGMA
NPs)
NPs prepared as above were resuspended in MilliQ water
at a final
concentration of 2 mg/mL. Propargylamine (90 μL, 2 equiv) was
added dropwise to 50 mL of the NP suspension under stirring. The reaction
mixture was left stirring under an atmosphere of argon for 24 h at
room temperature. Unreacted propargylamine was removed by repeated
washing and centrifugation (×4, 35 mL of MilliQ water each wash)
at 20 000g for 30 min. The equivalent dry
mass of NPs was determined after freeze-drying. Successful propargylamine
attachment was confirmed using FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum
One instrument with an ATR attachment).

Preparation of Azide-Functionalized
FA (Azido-Folic Acid)
A terminal azide functionality was
introduced onto FA utilizing
a previously reported method.20 FA (500
mg) was dissolved in DMSO (20 mL) containing 250 μL of triethylamine.
To this solution, 260 mg of NHS (2.2 equiv) and 250 mg of DCC (1.1
equiv) were added and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Then,
0.24 g of 3-azido-1-propylamine (2 equiv) was added to the reaction
mixture, which was stirred for another 24 h. The precipitated side
product, dicyclohexylurea, was removed by filtration, and the crude
product was precipitated in ethyl acetate. The crude product was dried
overnight under vacuum. It was then dissolved in 1 M NaOH, precipitated
in 1 M HCl, and purified by repeated washing and centrifugation (×4,
ethanol/water = 1:1, 30 mL each wash). The obtained final product
was dried under vacuum, and its identity was confirmed using FTIR
(Perkin Elmer, Spectrum One instrument with an ATR attachment) and
NMR (1H, DMSO-d6, 399.868 MHz,
Varian 400 WB spectrometer) spectroscopy. The yield was 72%.

Synthesis
of FA-Conjugated NPs Using the Click Chemistry Approach
Dispersions
of propargylated NPs (12 mL, 2 mg/mL) and azido-folic
acid solutions (5 mL, 9 mg/mL) were separately prepared in freshly
made NH4HCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) and mixed
together while stirring. A freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution
(50 mol % to the azido group, in NH4HCO3 buffer)
followed by a CuSO4·5H2O solution (20 mol
% to the azido group, in NH4HCO3 buffer) was
added, and the mixture was left to stir at room temperature for 12
h under an atmosphere of argon. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was
centrifuged at 20 000g for 30 min to collect
the pelleted NPs. The NPs were repeatedly washed to remove unreacted
azido-folic acid (×4; 30 mL NH4HCO3 buffer,
10 mM, pH 8.0) and dialyzed (Spectra/Por Float-A-Lyzer MWCO = 100
kDa) for 24 h against a solution of 0.125% (w/v) Pluronic F108 dissolved
in 2 L of NH4HCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). Successful
attachment and the presence of FA were confirmed using FTIR and UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy. The amount of FA present per unit mass of
NPs was calculated from a FA standard curve prepared previously.

NP Characterization
NP samples were prepared at 0.20
mg/mL in Pluronic F108 (0.125% w/v in MilliQ water) for size and zeta
potential measurements. Both size and surface charge were measured
in triplicate using the Zetasizer Nano series ZEN 3600 (Malvern Instruments).
Each measurement was averaged over 12 runs for size and 100 runs for
zeta potential. Samples for TEM were prepared by deposition and drying
of 10 μL of the NP dispersion onto carbon-coated grids. TEM
images were taken at 120 kV on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope.

In Vitro Testing
Cell Culture Materials
SKOV-3 cells
(HTB-77, passage
81) and A549 cells (CCL-185, passage 27) were purchased from ATCC
(American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA 20108 USA). HAL-15,
a primary cell line isolated from normal human liver, was a kind gift
from Prof. George Yeoh, the University of Western Australia. All cells
were maintained in folate free RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (GIBCO)
supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL streptomycin
(Sigma Aldrich), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence,
the primary antibody used was an α-tubulin (DM1A) mouse mAb
(Cell signalling technologies) and the secondary antibody used was
an AlexaFlour 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes).
DAPI was used for nuclei staining. Antibodies used for the flow cytometry
analysis of receptor expression were allophycocyanin (APC) human FOLR1
mAb (FRα) antibody (R&D systems) and APC-tagged mouse IgG1
K Isotype control (R&D systems). The antibody diluent used was
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 10% normal goat serum (Invitrogen)
and 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma Aldrich).

Flow Cytometric Analysis
of FRα (FOLR1) Receptor Expression
Cells were harvested from
an ongoing subculture flask (75 cm2 surface area, canted
neck, Greiner cell culture flask supplied by Sigma Aldrich, Australia)
and grouped into two sets of 5 × 105 cells in triplicate
in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, supplied by Sigma Aldrich,
Australia). The cell samples were washed with fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4 with 2% FBS) and resuspended
in 40 μL of the FACS buffer. APC-tagged human FOLR1 mAb (FRα)
antibody (10 μL; for test samples) and 10 μL of APC tagged
mouse IgG1 K Isotype control (for control samples) were added and
mixed into each of the cell samples in the two sets, respectively.
The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the dark.
Post incubation, the excess antibody was removed by washing (2×)
with 500 μL of FACS buffer followed by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 200 μL
of FACS buffer and kept on ice until analysis. Analysis was done using
a BD LSRFortessa SORP cell analyzer (BD Biosciences) within one hour
of sample preparation. APC fluorescence was detected using a 660/20
band pass filter. A total of 80 000 events were recorded and
further gated for single cells that were analyzed for FOLR1 expression.
Data were analyzed using the FlowJo Analysis software.

Toxicity
Studies
SKOV-3 (passage 83), A549 (passage
31), and HAL-15 cells were separately seeded in 12-well plates (Greiner
Bio-One Cell star, supplied by Sigma Aldrich) at a density of 50 000
cells per well with 2 mL of folate-free RPMI 1640 culture medium (GIBCO;
supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
and 10% fetal bovine serum). After overnight incubation at 37 °C
in 5% CO2, the cells were washed with prewarmed Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and incubated with RPMI 1640 culture
medium [GIBCO; supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)]
containing RhB-PGMA NPs or FA-RhB-PGMA NPs at the concentrations of
1, 10, and 100 μg/mL. Control cells were incubated with culture
media only. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2, 200 μL of MTS reagent was added into each
well and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Absorption was read at 492
nm using an Enspire 2300 multimodal plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Experiments
were conducted in triplicate, and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
test at 95% confidence level was applied post hoc to compare unpaired
means of absorbance values (n = 3).

NP Uptake
Studies
SKOV-3 (passage 81) and A549 cells
(passage 27) were plated at a density of 50 000 cells per well
on poly-(l-lysine)-coated glass coverslips placed in a 12-well
plate. After 24 h of incubation in 2 mL of folate-free RPMI 1640 culture
medium (GIBCO; supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin and 10% FBS), the cells were incubated for 12 h with
either 10 μg/mL RhB-PGMA NPs or 10 μg/mL FA-RhB-PGMA NPs
prepared in culture media. After incubation, media and NPs were removed,
and the cells were washed 3× with DPBS and fixed using a paraformaldehyde
solution (4% w/v in MilliQ water). The fixed cells were washed 3×
with PBS and further incubated with α-tubulin (DM1A) mouse mAb
(1:4000 in antibody diluent) for 30 min at room temperature. The unattached
antibody was removed by washing 2× with PBS. These cells were
further incubated with AlexaFlour 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG antibody
(1:400 in antibody diluent) for 30 min at room temperature. The unattached
antibody was removed by washing with PBS (×2), and the cells
were incubated with a Hoechst solution (1:10 000 in PBS) for
5 min. The cells were finally washed with PBS (×2), and the samples
were mounted onto glass slides using fluoromount gold mounting media
for analysis using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Nikon A1Si).
