Au–FexOy nanocomposites with a variable
gold-to-iron ratio were stabilized with l-tryptophan. The
synthetic methodology is based on the facile redox reaction between
Au(III) and Fe(0) in the presence of gold nanoparticle as a seed at
room temperature in an aqueous medium. The synthesis results in the
deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of iron oxide layers.
Composition variation in the nanocomposites was obtained by controlling
the seed amount and reducing agent. These nanocomposites are used
as electrocatalysts for the thermodynamically unfavorable oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) from water. Among the nanocomposites, the most efficient
OER activity was observed from the nanocomposite 12.
The content of iron with respect to gold is at the maximum in the
nanocomposite, which was obtained from the reaction with a minimum
seed concentration and maximum reducing agent.

Introduction
Electrochemical splitting
of water into hydrogen and oxygen is
no doubt a matter of significant interest for the scientific community
recently because of its potential applications in renewable energy
technology.1 Water oxidation reaction is
mainly controlled by the oxygen generation step; a four electron transfer
process, which is thermodynamically less favorable.2 Therefore, devices or materials capable of generating oxygen
from water are the current forefront research area.

In this
regard, metal nanocomposites have attracted considerable
attention because of their tunable physical and chemical properties.3−8 So far, the combination of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) with three first
row transition metal oxides (Co, Ni, and Mn) has been reported to
exhibit promising OER activity in recent literature.9−14 To the best of our knowledge, Au–FexOy nanocomposite has been explored only once by Jaramillo’s
group as an OER catalyst.13 However, a
handful of Au–FexOy nanocomposites with
interesting catalytic and magnetic properties has been well explored
recently.14−20

Syntheses of Au–FexOy nanocomposites
usually involve the attachment of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles
with organic or inorganic polymeric support followed by modular surface
modification.21−23 In situ preparation of Au–FexOy nanocomposites generally involves the reduction of Au(III)
on the FexOy core as the platform followed by
stabilization with an appropriate stabilizing agent.24 Alternate routes include the use of iron oxide pentacarbonyl
or iron oleate as the iron source at elevated temperature in an inert
atmosphere along with the gold nanoparticle as the core in the composite.25 Despite having handful of literature resources
for the synthesis of Au–FexOy nanocomposites,
there is a paucity of generalized methodology at ambient reaction
conditions.

This work demonstrates the establishment of the
one-pot seed-mediated
synthetic method for Au–FexOy nanocomposites
at room temperature in an aqueous medium using l-tryptophan
as a stabilizing agent and iron powder as the reducing agent (Scheme 1). It is noteworthy
to mention that tryptophan has been used for the first time to stabilize
transition metal oxide and noble metal nanocomposites, considering
its strong electron donating properties and water solubility during
the stabilization of gold nanoparticles.26−28 The synthesized
Au–FexOy nanocomposites have been successfully
used as electrocatalyst for the OER. The OER activity of the nanocomposites
has further been correlated with the variation of iron amounts in
these materials.

Synthetic Process with a Variable Au:Fe Composition Ratio for OER
Activity
Results and Discussion
In the current syntheses of Au–FexOy nanocomposites, iron powder has been used as the reducing agent
for Au(II) reduction because of its comparable reduction potential
[E0Fe(II)/Fe = −0.45
V] to that of hydroquinone.29 Although
the redox reaction between Au(III) and Fe(0) is favorable as per their
redox properties, a successful reaction requires AuNP (16 ± 3
nm) as the seed and stabilizing agent for the nanocomposites.

The seed-mediated synthesis of the Au–FexOy nanocomposites has been performed in the presence of highly
water-soluble l-amino acids to investigate their role as
a stabilizing agent for the nanocomposites. Among the 16 different
amino acids, only the solution-containing tryptophan develops a violet
color accompanied by the formation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
band at 556 nm, indicating the formation of gold nanomaterials (Figure 1). Out of 21 essential
amino acids, 5 amino acids could not be utilized because of their
poor solubility in an aqueous medium. Under the same reaction condition,
other 15 amino acids except tryptophan do not show any color change
even after prolong reaction time, demonstrating the function of tryptophan
as the stabilizing agent for the nanomaterial. The indole moiety of
tryptophan, which is absent in other amino acids, creates the difference
in the interaction with gold nanoparticle. The oxygen of carboxylic
acid group and nitrogen of indole are responsible for the additional
stabilization of gold nanomaterial.30 Moreover
the other amine nitrogen of tryptophan, which generally does not interact
with gold, can interact with iron oxide for the stabilization of nanomaterial.

Figure 1 Selectivity
of tryptophan as a stabilizing agent: absorption spectra
after the redox reaction between Au(III) and Fe(0) in the presence
of AuNP as a seed and different l-amino acids as the stabilizing
agent.

To find out the threshold amount
of tryptophan required for nanomaterial
formation, absorption experiment has been performed with varying tryptophan
concentrations (Figure S1). Absorption
profile shows that a threshold amount of 2 μmol (0.2 mM) tryptophan
is required for the development of the characteristic plasmonic band
for the nanomaterials. Furtherly, increment in the tryptophan concentration
up to 8 μmol does not show any significant alteration in the
SPR band.

We have then investigated the role of seed solution
for syntheses
of the nanomaterials (1–8) by varying
seed amounts from 90 × 109 to 720 × 109 mL–1 (Figure S2) during
the reduction of Au(III) in the presence of a constant amount of the
reducing and stabilizing agent. With increasing seed amount, the intensity
of the SPR band increases with a slight blue shift. The absorption
intensity remains almost unaltered after 540 × 109 mL–1 of seed solution. The surface charge (ζ
potential) from 1 to 8 increases (Figure S3) with the increase in the concentration
of seed. The polydispersity index (PDI) trend (Figure S3) suggests monodispersity increases with the seed
concentration. The same redox reaction in the absence of seed solution
does not show the appearance of the SPR band. This observation confirms
the requirement of the AuNP seed in the nanomaterial synthesis.

The gold nanoparticles have been deposited on the iron oxide layer
in the Au–FexOy nanocomposites 1 and 6 (seed 90 × 109 and 540
× 109 mL–1, respectively, Figure 2a) as confirmed by
TEM, FE-SEM images (Figure 2b–e). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) analyses
of FE-SEM images confirm the presence of iron in both of the nanocomposites 1 and 6 (Figure S4). The chemical components within the nanocomposites have been also
confirmed from the EDXS mapping and EDXS line scan profile (Figures S5–S8). These results clearly
show that the metal powder, which has participated in the redox reaction,
serves the role of reagent in the nanocomposite formation. The presence
of nitrogen confirms the participation of tryptophan in the nanocomposites.
This EDXS analyses show the poor incorporation of iron in the respective
nanocomposites (5% for 1 and 16% for 6).

with seed variation methodology with a low amount
of iron powder; TEM and FE-SEM images of (b, c) composites 1 and (d, e) 6. Scale bars in TEM: 200 nm and FE-SEM:
500 nm.

Furthermore, the effect of variation
of iron powder compared with
the iron amount used for 1 and 6 nanocomposite
syntheses has also been explored with two different seed concentrations
(Figure 3a). In the
absence of iron powder, no amino acids develop the characteristic
SPR band, confirming the vital role of metal powder in the reduction
process (Figure S9 for tryprophan). With
a fixed seed and a tryptophan amount, increasing the iron amount (from
18 μmol to 90 μmol) results in the formation of nanocomposites,
exhibiting clear SPR peak at 555 nm (Figure S9). With 90 × 109 mL–1 of seed amount,
the addition of a different iron amount results in the formation of
nanocomposites 1, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and 540 × 109 mL–1 of seed nanocomposites 6, 13, 14, 15, and 16 (Figure S9). ζ potential and monodispersity
increases from 9 to 12 (Figure S10) with the increase in the concentration of iron
amount in the presence of low seed concentration. However, in the
case of higher seed concentration, surface charge densities and polydispersity
are almost constant from 13 to 16 (Figure S10) with the increasing concentration
of the iron amount. Nanocomposites 12 and 16 have been taken as representative materials for further characterization
purpose. The TEM and FE-SEM images (Figure 3b–e) clearly confirm the deposition
of gold nanoparticles on the iron oxide layer.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic representation
of Au–FexOy nanocomposites with seed
variation methodology with a high amount
of iron powder; TEM and FE-SEM images of (b, c) composites 12 and (d, e) 16. Scale bars in TEM: 200 nm and FE-SEM:
500 nm.

The EDXS mapping and EDXS line
scan profile (Figures S11–S15) also
indicate the formation of tryptophan
stabilized Au-FexOy nanocomposites. According
to EDXS analysis of FE-SEM images, a higher amount of iron incorporation
with respect to gold takes place in the case of nanocomposite 12 (26%) compared to the nanocomposite 1 (5%).
This enhancement of iron content within these two nanocomposites in
the presence of lower seed concentration can be correlated to the
amount of iron used in the syntheses. However, the iron content with
respect to gold shows slight enhancement in nanocomposite 16 (20%) compared to the nanocomposite 6 (16%), where
the syntheses have been performed with the higher seed amount.

XPS measurements have been carried out to further investigate the
chemical compositions and elemental valence states for nanocomposites 1, 6, 12, and 16. The
survey spectra confirmed the presence of gold, iron, carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen atoms in the nanocomposites (Figure S16). The detailed scans for N 1s (Figure S17) for 16 show two peaks around 398.3 and 401.0
eV after deconvolution due to the presence of the indole-based nitrogen
atom and amine nitrogen of tryptophan. From high resolution scans
for 2p of Fe, two distinct peaks can be identified at 709.88 and 723.3
eV, which can be assigned to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 electrons, respectively (Figure S17).31 The Fe 2p3/2 has associated
the satellite peak around 719 eV, indicating the predominance of Fe2O3 in these samples.32

The broad peak in IR spectra (Figure S18) with maximum peak intensity at 3423 cm–1 is due
to the stretching vibration of amine group from tryptophan.27 The small peaks around 2925 cm–1 are due to methylene protons of tryptophan. The position of carbonyl
frequency has been shifted to 1615 cm–1 because
of the interaction of carbonyl oxygen with the gold nanoparticle.27 In addition to the XPS, the IR spectra within
a part of the finger print region (400–600 cm–1) suggest the formation of γ-Fe2O3 in
samples 1 and 6 and α-Fe2O3 in samples 12 and 16 (Figure
S18).33 In PXRD, only the peaks due to
Au(0) has been observed (Figure S19). The absence of diffraction pattern
for iron oxide suggests the similar amorphous nature in the nanocomposites.
The 2θ values at 38.3, 44.5, and 64.7 angles are due to (111),
(200), and (220) planes, respectively, according to the JCPDS (Joint
Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) no. 04-0784, USA for Au
nanoparticles. The crystallite size from XRD using the Scherrer equation
for gold has been found to be 15 nm, which is in good agreement to
the size of gold nanoparticles obtained from TEM images.

To
investigate the electrocatalytic behavior of the synthesized
Au–FexOy catalysts, cyclic voltametric
scans for the nanocomposites (1, 6, 12, and 16) have been executed in a 1.0 M KOH
solution at 50 mV s–1 scan rate. The oxidation and
reduction peaks in all the cases correspond to a Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple (Figure S20). The
OER activities of the synthesized Au–Fe2O3 nanocomposites have been investigated by LSV in an alkaline aqueous
solution at pH 13.0 with the FTO glass plate coated with different
nanomaterials as a working electrode.

The polarization curves
in Figure 4a demonstrate
the comparative OER activity of the nanocomposites
(1, 6, 12, and 16) and the mixture of seeds with commercially available Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 mixtures. In both these
mixtures, we have used 26% iron oxide with respect to gold amount.
It has been found that all the nanocomposites show better OER activity
with respect to control materials. The significant enhancement in
the OER activity of the composites is probably due to strong-localized
interfacial interactions between Au and FexOy and the increase in the active surface area after composite formation,
which has been observed in the case of gold–manganese oxides.34 For oxygen evolution reaction, the overpotential
at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 is commonly used as a
figure of merit for the catalysts. The overpotential values are 0.53,
0.52, 0.45, and 0.47 V for nanocomposites 1, 6, 12, and 16, respectively. Therefore,
compound 12 can be considered the best electrocatalyst
among these four Au–FexOy nanocomposites
for OER activity. Overpotentials of the controlled materials are greater
than 0.65 V at 10 mA/cm2 current density. The overpotential
values in the presence of gold in the nanocomposites are similar to
the reported observation.13 The observed
maximum enhancement in the OER activity of 12 is due
to the presence of the highest Au:Fe ratio among the Au–FexOy nanocomposites. The better OER activity of nanocomposites
in comparison to individual gold or iron oxide nanomaterial might
be due to the local interaction of Au through its dissolution and
deposition onto FexOy sites. This is similar
to the reported case of Au/MnOx OER activity.34

and commercially available FexOy nanoparticles
at pH 13.0. (b) Tafel plots obtained from the corresponding LSVs.
(c) Impedance spectra of the nanocomposites 1 (black), 6 (red), 12 (blue), and 16 (green).

To analyze the comparative electrocatalytic
behavior, Tafel slope,
which is an important parameter, has been calculated (Figures 4b and S21). It is well-known that the smaller the Tafel slope, the
higher the charge transfer coefficient, resulting in lowering of energy
barrier of the electrochemical reaction.35

Tafel slopes obtained from the four nanocomposites, 1, 6, 12, and 16, from
the
plot overpotential (η) versus the logarithm of current density
are 210, 198, 132, and 159 mV/dec (Table 1), indicating the better electrocatalytic
efficacy of 12 and 16 compared to 1 and 6 (Figure 4b). These Tafel slopes are significantly smaller in
comparison to the commercially available iron oxide nanomaterials
(Figure S21). However, the Tafel slopes
for the nanocomposites 1, 6, 12, and 16 are higher in comparison to the core–shell
Au–FexOy nanoparticles13 of a much smaller size. The Faradic efficiencies during
OER are 84, 86, 93, and 91% for the nanocomposites 1, 6, 12, and 16, respectively. The
nitrogen-containing aromatic indole group in tryptophan shows a different
one-electron oxidation potential at a different environment.36 Tryptophan might be also effective in the catalytic
activity as it can modulate the electrochemistry of nanocomposites
at different concentrations.37 The nitrogen
of indole may contribute in the charge separation38 because of the electronegativity differences between iron
and the nitrogen. This charge separation may enhance the OH– adsorption on the nanomaterial surface, which eventually results
in the increase of the OER activity.

To
investigate the electron transfer kinetics, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements have been performed with
the four nanocomposites. Figure 4c describes the Nyquist plots acquired for the nanocomposites
at their overpotentials. The charge transfer resistances for 1, 6, 12, and 16 nanocomposites
are 298, 250, 78, and 110 Ω (Table 1), which is again consistent with the OER
activity of the catalysts. The electrocatalytic trend of the catalysts
may be explained in terms of the iron content in the composites. The
order of iron content in the catalysis is 12 > 16 > 6 > 1, which resemblance
the
order of their catalytic activity, that is, the turn over frequency
of the catalysts (Table 1). Increase in the iron content might result in the increment of
the active sites in the catalysts, which causes enhancement in the
OER activity. To check the stability of the materials, a chronoamperometry
test (Figure S22) has been carried out
for the nanocomposites at their corresponding overpotentials for 5
h, and the current densities have been found to be extremely stable
for nanocomposites 1 and 16, indicating
a long-term viability of these materials. Ratios of gold and iron
in the nanocomposites after electrochemistry have been analyzed with
the EDXS analysis of FE-SEM images (Figure S23 and Table S1). Slight losses of iron (within 0.5–5%)
with respect to the gold amount have been observed in all the nanocomposites
probably because of the formation of FeO42– as reported.13 Because the loss of iron
is less than 5%, these materials are sufficiently stable after their
electrocatalytic performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a facile room temperature synthetic
route for tryptophan-stabilized Au–FexOy nanocomposites. These nanocomposites were obtained in the presence
of gold nanoparticle seed after the redox reaction between Au(III)
and Fe(0). The variation of seed and iron amounts in the reaction
mixture leads to form Au–FexOy, having
a different Au:Fe ratio. These Au–FexOy nanocomposites were explored for their role as electrocatalysts
during the OER from water in a basic condition. The OER activity of
the catalysts has been rationalized on the basis of their overpotentials,
and we have seen that the catalytic performance directly depends upon
the amount of the iron content in the nanocomposites. The stabilities
of the materials have been monitored by chronoamperometry test and
the FE-SEM analysis of the nanocomposites after OER performance. The
environmentally friendly synthetic modification of Au–FexOy nanocomposites with lower overpotentials and
Tafel slopes is currently ongoing in our laboratory.

Materials
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Trisodium citrate dehydrate was purchased from
Merck chemicals. Iron powder was purchased from SISCO Research Laborites. l-amino acids were purchased from Himedia Laboratories Pvt.
Ltd. The preparation of the seed solution and concentration per milliliter
calculation was performed as per literature methods.39,40 All the synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by absorbance
spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), powder
x-ray diffraction (PXRD), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

General Syntheses of Nanocomposites in the Presence of Amino
Acids as Stabilizing Agent
For gold–iron oxide nanocomposites
stabilized with different l-amino acids, 16 different solutions
were prepared. Each solution contains 10 mg (25 μmol) HAuCl4, 450 × 109 AuNP seed mL–1 in 100 mL of Millipore water. To these solutions, 5 μmol of
16 different amino acids were added. Finally, 10 mg (18 μmol)
of iron powder was added to all the solutions for the syntheses of
nanocomposites. The generation of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
peak was studied in each case to monitor the formation of nanocomposite-containing
gold.

Syntheses of Nanocomposites: 1–8
For gold–iron oxide nanocomposites with variable
seed concentration, nine different solutions were prepared. Each solution
contains 10 mg (25 μmol) HAuCl4 in 100 mL Millipore
water. To these solutions, eight different seed amounts, 90 ×
109, 180 × 109, 270 × 109, 360 × 109, 450 × 109, 540 ×
109, 630 × 109, and 720 × 109 mL–1 were added for the syntheses of nanocomposites 1–8, respectively. In each of these solutions,
an additional 50 μL solution of tryptophan (5 μmol in
1:1 mixture of water and ethanol) and 10 mg (18 μmol) iron powder
were added. All these reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature
for 60 min and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated by evaporation
and 1–8 nanocomposites were obtained
as solid materials from the filtrate after 3 days. After discarding
the supernatant solutions, the solid nanocomposites were further dried
under vacuum before characterization. One-negative control reaction
was prepared without any AuNP as seed.

Syntheses of Nanocomposites 9–12
For gold–iron oxide
nanocomposites with variable
iron concentration, five different reactions were prepared. Each solution
contains 10 mg (25 μmol) HAuCl4, 90 × 109 AuNP seed mL–1, and a 50 μL solution
of tryptophan (5 μmol in 1:1 mixture of water and ethanol) in
100 mL Millipore water. Iron powder amounts of 20 mg (36 μmol),
30 mg (54 μmol), 40 mg (72 μmol), and 50 mg (90 μmol)
were added for the syntheses of nanocomposites 9–12, respectively. All these reaction mixtures were stirred
at room temperature for 60 min and then filtered. The filtrate was
concentrated by evaporation, and 9–12 nanocomposites were obtained as solid materials from the filtrate
after 3 days. After discarding the supernatant solutions, the solid
nanocomposites were further dried under vacuum before characterization.
One-negative control reaction was prepared without any iron powder.

Syntheses of Nanocomposites 13–16
For gold–iron oxide nanocomposites with variable
iron concentration, five different reactions were prepared. Each solution
contains 10 mg (25 μmol) HAuCl4, 540 × 109 AuNP seed mL–1, and a 50 μL solution
of tryptophan (5 μmol in 1:1 mixture of water and ethanol) in
100 mL Millipore water. Iron powder amounts of 20 mg (36 μmol),
30 mg (54 μmol), 40 mg (72 μmol) and 50 mg (90 μmol)
were added for the syntheses of nanocomposites 13–16, respectively. All these reaction mixtures were stirred
at room temperature for 60 min and then filtered. The filtrate was
concentrated by evaporation, and 13–16 nanocomposites were obtained as solid materials from the filtrate
after 3 days. After discarding the supernatant solutions, the solid
nanocomposites were further dried under vacuum before characterization.
One-negative control reaction was prepared without any iron powder.

Characterizations
Absorbance spectroscopy of gold–iron
oxide nanocomposite solutions was characterized using a Synergy micro
plate reader (BIOTEK, USA). Absorbance spectra were taken within the
400–800 nm wavelength range. The solid sample was dispersed
in Millipore water and drop casted on a Carbon-coated 200 mesh TEM
grid. The TEM images were taken by FEI, Technai G2 20 S-TWIN. The
solutions were drop casted on a silicon wafer for FE-SEM experiments
and air dried for analyses. The FE-SEM images (Carl ZEISS Ultra plus
Gemini, Germany) was employed to analyze the morphological features,
Energy dispersive X-ray (EDXS) and EDXS mapping, and line scanning
of the nanocomposites were performed. The PDI and ζ potential
of the nanocomposites were measured using Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern
Instruments). DTS application 7.03 software was used to analyze the
data. All PDI reported here were based on intensity average. For each
sample, three DLS measurements were conducted with a fixed 11 runs,
and each run lasts 10 s.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical experiments
were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell at room temperature
with a 660D CH Instrument potentiostat. A Standard calomel electrode
(SCE) was used as the reference electrode. The working electrode was
nanomaterial-coated FTO plates. Pt wire was used as the counter electrode.
A KOH amount of 1.0 M (pH ∼13.0) was used as the electrolytes.
The nanomaterial/FTO working electrode was prepared as follows: 1
mg of nanomaterials was added into 0.2 mL EtOH; 0.2 mL water and 0.06
mL 5% Nafion solution and ultrosonicated for 30 min to prepare the
ink; and then 20 μL of ink was loaded onto the FTO plate. The
catalyst loading area was maintained as ∼1 cm2.
Then, the plate was dried at room temperature for 24 h. Linear scan
voltammograms (LSV) were recorded at a scanning rate of 50 mV/s. The
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out
in a N2-saturated 1 M KOH (pH ∼13.0) solution at
0.5 V (vs SCE). Potentials were converted to RHE for comparison. The
EIS spectra were obtained in a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an amplitude value of 5 mV. The charge transfer resistance
(Rct) was determined by fitting the Nyquist
plot to a Randles equivalent circuit. Faradaic efficiency was calculated
on the basis of the volume of the oxygen collected per area of electrode
at their corresponding onset potentials for 5 h (Figure S24a), and the theoretical number of moles of the gas
per area of electrode was calculated using the ideal gas law (nO2 = PV/RT). Finally, the nO2 was converted to photocurrent
density (using photocurrent density = 4 × nO2 × F, where F is the Faraday constant, which
is 0.096487 C/μmol). Amounts of oxygen produced were 45.3, 47.4,
60.3, and 56.3 mmol for 1, 6, 12, and 16, respectively (after blank subtraction), which
was obtained from the calibration curve in Figure S25. The total accumulated charge during 5 h of electrolysis
was found to be 20.8, 25.3, 25.3, and 23.9 C (after blank subtraction)
for 1, 6, 12, and 16, respectively (Figure S24b).
