The fabrication of organic optoelectronic devices integrating asymmetric electrodes
enables optimal charge injection/extraction at each individual metal/semiconductor
interface. This is key for applications in devices such as solar cells,
light-emitting transistors, photodetectors, inverters, and sensors.
Here, we describe a new method for the asymmetric functionalization
of gold electrodes with different thiolated molecules as a viable
route to obtain two electrodes with drastically different work function
values. The process involves an ad hoc design of electrode geometry
and the use of a polymeric mask to protect one electrode during the
first functionalization step. Photoelectron yield ambient spectroscopy
and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry were used to characterize the
energetic properties and the composition of the asymmetrically functionalized
electrodes. Finally, we used poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based organic
thin-film transistors to show that the asymmetric electronic response
stems from the different electronic structures of the functionalized
electrodes.

Introduction
Surface functionalization
is widely used in organic electronics
for modulating interfacial properties at the micro- and nanoscale.1 Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of molecules
with a thiol head group enable chemical and supramolecular functionalization
of gold electrodes in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs).2 Such functionalization of the Au electrodes is
of pivotal importance for controlling the charge injection at the
organic–semiconductor interfaces,3 balancing hole and electron injection, thus lowering the interfacial
resistance at contacts.4 Furthermore, the
possibility of grafting specific functional units on Au electrodes
is key for applications in (bio)sensing and multifunctional devices.5 An SAM induces a shift of the Fermi level by
chemisorption and introduces a dipole facing the metal surface, each
contributing to an increase or decrease of the metal work function
(WF) depending on the sign of the shift and the dipole orientation,
respectively.6 As a consequence, it is
possible to tune the WF of an electrode to match the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital -LUMO)
of a p-type (n-type) semiconductor, thus enabling the fabrication
of devices with ohmic contacts at the metal–semiconductor interfaces.7 The direction of the WF shift depends on the
nature of the substituent group inserted at the ω-position of
the thiolated molecule.8 Alkanethiols are
known to lower the WF, whereas halogenated terminated thiols are known
to increase it.9 The insertion of an SAM
at the metal–semiconductor interface also has more subtle effects
on the charge injection, distinct from the WF shift. In particular:
(i) it may affect the wettability of the electrode and the packing
motif that the organic semiconductor adopts on surfaces and in the
bulk,10 and (ii) it introduces a nonconductive
barrier that must be overcome or crossed by the charge carriers to
be injected from the electrode into the semiconductor.11 The tunneling resistance increases exponentially
with the length of the thiolated molecule, whereas it decreases with
their degree of conjugation.2b In addition,
the molecular details of the moieties forming the SAM bring into play
on some finer aspects, such as the emergence of odd–even effects
in the effective charge mobility versus chain length.12 During the last decade, the research endeavor has been
mostly focused on the symmetric functionalization of the source–drain
electrodes, that is, with one molecular function exposed equally on
the surface of the electrodes. In 2010, Liscio and co-workers have
proposed a bottom-up technique for achieving asymmetric electrode
functionalization.13 It consisted of a
four-step procedure, which started with the symmetric SAM growth on
both electrodes, followed by the electrochemical desorption of the
SAM from only one of the two electrodes, followed by the chemisorption
of a second thiolated molecule on the previously uncoated electrode.
Asymmetric electrodes have already a wide range of applications. They
are currently developed by employing different metals and are successfully
used to enhance extraction of holes and electrons for application
in solar cells,14 light-emitting transistors
(LETs), inverters, photodetectors, and sensors.15 However, the molecular approach, via the asymmetric functionalization,
presents the distinctive advantage of using electrodes of the same
metal (Au in this case), thus making the fabrication easier and quicker.
Being based on the broad arsenal of thiolated molecules available
possessing distinct characteristics, it also represents a versatile
solution. Moreover, such specific functionalization allows one to
control the interfacial properties, like wettability and the tunneling
barrier of each electrode, thus enabling the tuning of the properties
of each individual electrode. Unfortunately, the fabrication method
proposed by Liscio et al. has some drawbacks. It involves the use
of strong alkaline solutions that enhance bias stress during operations
and may lead to the delamination of the electrodes from the substrate
during the SAM desorption step. Because of these difficulties, asymmetric
electrodes via SAM chemisorption of different thiols have not been
proposed in the literature for a working device. More importantly,
a fundamental piece in the field of nanotechnology applications, that
is, a working asymmetric functionalized OFET, has not been reported
to date.

Results and Discussion
In this work, we propose a robust
and reliable approach to the
asymmetric functionalization via SAM of interdigitated electrodes
by exploiting different microfabrication techniques. The process relies
on the ad hoc design of the electrode shape and geometry. In this
way, it is possible to fabricate a protective mask to cover just one
of the two electrodes during the first SAM functionalization step.
It requires precise microcutting and microalignment of the substrates
but does not involve any step of photolithography. The proposed procedure
is simple, is promptly implemented in any laboratory, and does not
require further (electro)chemical desorption procedure.

For
our purpose, we have chosen two thiolated molecules forming
SAMs that induce a substantial energy asymmetry between the Au electrodes
on which they chemisorb: decanethiol (DT) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol
(PFDT). Their SAMs lead to the change of the WF of the electrodes
in opposite directions due to the surface dipole moments that arise
from the opposite polarity of the linear chains: the alkyl chain is
weakly positively polar, with respect to thiol head, whereas the halogenated
chain is strongly negatively polarized with respect to the thiol head.
This yields a strong asymmetry of the charge injection in the target
device. Because the SAM thickness is the same (differing less than
0.1 nm),16 the tunneling barrier will have
the roughly the same geometrical length scale at both electrodes.
Tunneling resistance is characterized by the exponential inverse decay
length, β, of the tunneling probability. The reported β
values for fluorinated chains are slightly larger than those for alkyl
chains.17 In the present work, we will
show that despite the difference in β values, the asymmetry
in the electrical properties of the OTFTs can be ascribed mostly to
the change in WF at the zero-th order, with higher-order contributions
from other electronic effects (energy of the localized states assisting
through-bond tunneling, polarization effects, and vibrations).

For this work, we have designed a contact mask for patterning interdigitated
electrodes by thermal evaporation on target substrates. The masks
were fabricated using laser scan lithography. The laser scan marker
Marko (Laserpoint SRL, Milan, Italy) has a pulsed (10 ps width, 20
kHz repetition rate, 50% duty cycle) Nd:YAG infrared (IR) laser centered
at λ = 1064 nm. Nickel plates, 1 mm thick, were cut with the
laser, while freestanding on the Marko’s stage. A schematic
drawing of the masks is shown in Figure 1a. They were designed with a channel width
(W) of 150 mm and a channel length (L) of 500 μm, yielding a W/L = 300. A typical functionalization and fabrication procedure starts
by employing the evaporator masks to evaporate onto the n++-Si/SiO2 substrates first a 5 nm thick Cr adhesion layer and then
a 45 nm thick gold film (Figure 1b).

OTFT. (a)
Evaporation mask is cut on a nickel plate. (b) Mask is used to evaporate
the electrode on a SiO2 substrate. (c) Protective mask
is placed on top of one electrode. (d) Electrode with the protective
mask is placed in the solution and the nonprotected electrode is functionalized
with DT. The polymeric mask is then removed by mechanical peeling.
(e) Sample is placed in the PFDT solution to functionalize the second
electrode with the fluorinated thiol. Finally, (f) poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT) is spin-coated on top to finalize a bottom-gate, bottom-contact
asymmetric OTFT.

A polymer mask was designed
with the aim of completely protecting
one of the two electrodes. The selected material for the polymeric
mask fabrication is a laminated multilayer (poly(ethylene terephthalate)/acrylic),
which guarantees a perfect adhesion and avoids leakage of the solution
over the protected electrodes. The mask was laser-cut with Marko starting
from the drawing of the evaporation mask. The protective mask was
planned to perfectly cover the electrode with a margin of 250 μm
on each side. The electrodes were ozone cleaned, and the mask was
optically aligned on top of one of the electrodes (Figure 1c). The protective mask avoids
the solution to enter in contact with the electrode. Such protective
masks are not reusable, but their cost can be estimated at about 0.01€.
The sample was immersed for 36 h in a 1 mM solution of DT in EtOH
to grow the SAM on electrode 1. The sample was cleaned with warm EtOH,
CHCl3, and 2-propanol. The polymer mask was then removed
by mechanically peeling it off with tweezers (Figure 1d), and the sample was cleaned again with
2-propanol. After drying under N2, the sample was put for
36 h in a 1 mM solution of PFDT in EtOH to functionalize electrode
2 (Figure 1e). To rinse
all physisorbed thiolated molecules, the sample was cleaned by successively
squirting warm EtOH, CHCl3, and 2-propanol and drying under
N2 flow. To ensure complete removal of eventual mask residues,
the sample was sonicated in toluene for 10 min at 60 °C.

The decision of functionalizing first with DT and then with PFDT
was taken after analyzing the effect on the final WF of gold. Thiols
with longer chains typically exhibit greater affinity for gold with
respect to shorter ones, and usually this criterion is applied to
decide which thiol should be used first.13 In our case, having the two thiols of the same length, we performed
photoelectron yield ambient (PEYA) spectroscopy measurements to gain
insight into the substitution process occurring at the electrode surface.
A surface of 1 cm2 of Au has been functionalized with the
procedure described above. In Figure 2a are reported the spectra recorded with the PEYA technique.
A difference exceeding 1.2 eV is obtained by functionalizing Au with
DT and PFDT. Such marked difference is expected to yield a strong
asymmetry in the OTFTs. When DT was employed in the first step, we
measured the WF of the SAM-functionalized electrode as being 4.25
± 0.05 eV. Such a low value is in good agreement with previous
studies.18 In contrast, Au functionalized
first with PFDT exhibited an effective WF value of 5.60 ± 0.05
eV, the higher value being expected from perfluoro-methyl terminated
moieties.4a Those samples were then immersed
into EtOH solutions of PFDT and DT, respectively, as second functionalization,
and their effective WF was measured again. In dotted lines (Figure 2a) are reported the spectra
obtained after an already functionalized gold surface was placed in
a solution of the other thiols. A slight shift is observed in both
cases. This can be due to a partial exchange reaction between the thiols
occurring at the interface and to the second thiol filling eventual
defects occurring during the first SAM functionalization step. The
sample first functionalized with DT and then PFDT presented an effective
WF of 4.50 ± 0.05 eV, which implies a downward shift of 0.25
eV of the surface vacuum level. The sample first functionalized with
PFDT and then DT exhibited a WF value of 5.40 ± 0.05 eV, with
a shift of 0.15 eV upward of the surface vacuum level. These shifts
are due to ligand exchange at the electrodes occurring during the
second functionalization, when the protective mask is removed. Pristine
gold showed a WF value of 4.95 ± 0.05 eV (see the Supporting Information for complete details).
Our target device was based on an active layer of P3HT. When spin-coated
from chloroform, the HOMO level of P3HT is centered at around 4.8
eV.19 The energy levels of our system are
depicted in Figure 2b. Hence, at a first glance, the DT-functionalized electrode will
present, with respect to P3HT, an injection barrier for holes due
to the lower WF, whereas for the PFDT-functionalized electrode no
injection barrier should occur. Electrodes first functionalizing with
PFDT and then DT will produce an asymmetry of (1.15 ± 0.05),
whereas proceeding the other way around would lead to a (1.10 ±
0.05) asymmetry. All of the extracted data are summarized in Table S1. It is evident that any order of functionalization
would lead to the same outcome (dashed levels in Figure 2b), that is, an electrode with
a lower WF with respect to the HOMO of P3HT and the other one with
a higher WF value. Therefore, a different electronic response should
be observed when injecting from the DT-functionalized electrode (higher
injection barrier for hole carriers, else lower injection barrier
for electron carriers) or from the PFDT-functionalized electrode (no
injection barrier for hole carriers, else higher injection barrier
for electron carriers).

Photoelectron yield spectrum of pristine gold is reported in violet.
(b) Energy levels extracted from (a) of the studied system. Meshed
levels indicate the values measured on devices upon the second functionalization
step. P3HT HOMO level and gold WF are also reported.

As aforementioned, we started with DT first. This
choice has been
made to evaluate the different functionalization of the interdigitated
electrode by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) through the survey
of C–F and F signals. XPS spectra have been recorded in the
six central fingers of the device, that is, three belonging to electrode
1 and three belonging to electrode 2. As displayed in Figure S2, the S–Au bond is present in
each of them, confirming the successful functionalization of the electrodes
via chemisorption. The C–F signal is relatively stronger in
the fingers not covered by the mask, with respect to the ones protected
by the mask. This confirms the successful asymmetric functionalization
of the electrodes. The small amount of F signal in the even electrodes
should be ascribed to a partial exchange between DT and PFDT, as discussed
previously in the PEYA measurements (see the Supporting Information for details).

Once having verified the proper
asymmetrical functionalization
of the electrodes, we fabricated OTFTs using P3HT as a semiconductor.
A 5 mg mL–1 P3HT solution in chloroform was spin-coated
over the electrodes in a nitrogen atmosphere. We obtained a homogenous
film completely covering the electrodes’ area (see the Supporting Information). The sample was annealed
at 50 °C for 2 h to ensure complete evaporation of the solvents.
Such low-temperature annealing is of fundamental importance to preserve
the functionalization of the electrodes.20

We have tested our devices under a nitrogen atmosphere to
avoid
the occurrence of doping of P3HT. The devices were tested first connecting
one electrode to the source and then the other one. The results of
the electrical characterization are reported in Figure 3. We started by keeping the DT electrode
grounded and therefore the polarization was applied to the PFDT-functionalized
electrode. In this configuration, the charges are injected from the
PFDT electrode and collected by the DT electrodes in a stepwise configuration.21 The output curves (Figure 3a) show a perfect separation between each
different gate polarization. A small S-shape is observed close to
the 0 V drain voltage, indicating the presence of a small contact
resistance in the device.10 Such a shape
has already been reported in the literature for thin-film transistors
based on source and drain electrodes functionalized with chemisorbed
monolayers of thiolated molecules.3a,22 It can be
attributed to the fact that we introduced a barrier at the interface
that must be overcome by tunneling.

Figure 3 Output characteristic of the OTFT device
when injecting from (a)
the PFDT-functionalized electrode and (b) the DT-functionalized electrode. Id–Vd curves
are on the same scale so that differences in the drain current between
the two different configurations can be better highlighted. Transfer
characteristics are reported with Ids in
the llin scale (c) at Vds = 0.3 V and
(d) at Vds = 0.7 V. Curves obtained when
DT is injecting are reported in blue and those obtained when PFDT
is injecting are reported in red. In the inset, the area close to Vth is reported magnified to appreciate better
the threshold voltage shift.

Figure 3b
portrays
the output characteristic recorded with inverted connections, that
is, with the charges injected from the DT electrode (source) and collected
by the PFDT one (drain). A lower current is observed together with
an imperfect spacing of the curves. Again, a small S-shape close to
0 V drain voltage is present. We ascribe the lowered current to a
less favorable injection of holes, due to the low-injecting WF of
the DT-coated electrode, which leads to an energy barrier that must
be overcome by the injected holes. Transfer characteristics are reported
in Figure 3c,d at linear
(high Vds = −10 V) and saturation
(low Vds = −40 V) regimes, respectively.
In both cases, a lower current is observed when injecting from the
DT electrode (blue) together with a small shift toward more negative
values of the threshold voltage (Vth,
highlighted in the insets). The negative shift of Vth indicates that the DT-functionalized electrode effectively
acts as a trap for carriers. Thus, a higher (in magnitude) voltage
is needed for charges to be injected into the semiconducting active
layer, due to the increased energy barrier. In addition, it is possible
to notice in the positive part of the transfer curve that the current
is larger when injecting from DT electrodes, as expected from the
energy level alignment at the interface. In Table 1 are reported the extracted Vth and mobility values when injecting from DT and PFDT,
respectively, and the difference in the values (μPFDT – μDT and Vth,PFDT– Vth,DT) between the two configurations
averaged on over six samples.

a In the last row, the (μPFDT –
μDT and Vth,PFDT – Vth,DT) average
difference calculated on at least six samples in linear and saturation
regimes are reported.

The
difference between mobility values in the two configurations
is about 30% higher for injecting from PFDT, whereas the threshold
voltage shift is 2–3 V toward more negative values for injecting
from DT. It must be noticed that all the devices injecting from PFDT
always yielded higher hole mobilities compared to those injecting
from DT. Moreover, Vth was always more
positive with injection from the PFDT/Au electrode. This demonstrates
a perfect reproducibility of the asymmetric transistors. In addition,
leakage current was always at least 1 order of magnitude lower than
the source–drain current (Figure S9), proving the robust approach to the device fabrication employed.

Such differences, albeit being significant, are not as marked as
one could expect. To rationalize the results, we consider the total
resistance, RTOT, of the transistor as
given by 1  Rch is
the resistance
of the channel and Ri is the interface
or contact resistance. When the channel length is short, usually below
10–20 μm, Ri becomes dominant
in devices with bare Au electrodes.23 For
longer channels, Rch becomes increasingly
more important. However, our results show that even with a channel
length of 500 μm, the interfacial resistance, Ri, is sizable with our functionalization. Then, we discuss
the factors that may justify our observation. Wetting of the channel
material on electrodes may play a role. Surfaces with a lower surface
energy and matching that of P3HT lead to better packing, favorable
orientation, and less energy disorder10 of the semiconductor at the interface.18a In the present case, the DT-functionalized electrode exhibits a
water contact angle of 105.5 ± 0.7°, whereas the PFDT-coated
one is 103.5 ± 0.7° (see Figure S8 for data on extracted contact angle). We estimated that the two
functionalized surfaces exhibit very close surface free energy values
(see the Supporting Information). This
strongly hints that surface tension should not significantly affect
the morphology of the P3HT film at the two electrodes. This is in
agreement with the homogenous film we obtain also on the electrodes
(see the Supporting Information). Hence,
we believe that surface energy cannot justify the experimental difference
observed. As previously discussed, the larger inverse decay length,
β, of the fluorinated chains might partially mitigate the enhancement
effects due to the more favorable energy alignment between HOMO of
P3HT and the Fermi level in the case of PFDT electrodes. This may
partially compensate the WF difference leading to the significant,
albeit not extraordinary in magnitude, mismatch between the two different
injection schemes. In addition, the presence of the SAM at the interface
can affect the electrical output. The monolayer is electrostatic and
chemically bound at the surface so there is a thiol–gold dipole
and a dipole due to the head group of the monolayer.2b,24 This can generate low-lying trap states at the Au/SAM/P3HT interface1b as in the case of PFDT electrodes, which can
also partially hinder the asymmetric outcome of the device. For the
sake of completeness, we have performed all possible control experiments.
The pristine Au electrode presented better performances due to the
ohmic contact between the bare metal and P3HT. The observed response
is symmetrical to the reversal of injection by inverting the source
grounding. Devices with the electrodes both functionalized with the
same molecules, being either DT or PFDT, were also prepared. In this
case, a large shift toward negative values of Vth was observed for devices bearing DT molecules on the electrodes.
This is expected due to the large injection barrier induced by SAM.
All those configurations presented no asymmetry when the ground source
was swapped (see Figures S4 and S5). Finally,
partially functionalized electrodes, that is, just one electrode coated
with a chemisorbed SAM, have been prepared. Here, a similar behavior
to the asymmetric configuration performance was measured. Devices
with a DT electrode and a bare gold electrode showed a similar performance
as the previously discussed asymmetric DT/PFDT devices. This finding
is in agreement with the energetic alignment at the interface reported
in Figure 2 because
the gold has an ohmic contact with P3HT, whereas the DT electrode
gives rise to an energy barrier. This result paves the way for a smart
level alignment, with just one electrode functionalized without the
need of an electrochemical process. The other asymmetric devices,
with one electrode coated with PFDT and the other one with bare gold,
also showed a small asymmetry. In particular, when injecting from
gold, a 15% increase in mobility is observed. Such a difference can
be attributed to the fact that on the Au electrode the contribution
to the interfacial resistance is smaller. All of the curves and extracted
values are reported in Figures S6 and S7. The results from the control experiments, together with the ones
discussed here, support the fact that the mask strategy is effective
for the asymmetric functionalization of electrodes. They also show
that with the fine tuning of single electrodes it is possible to obtain
asymmetric electrical behavior even with just one electrode functionalized.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have devised a new method for the asymmetric
functionalization of gold electrodes with two different thiolated
molecules for applications in optoelectronic devices. Our technique
is robust and does not involve any electrochemical process. It made
possible to individually tune the WF of the source and drain electrodes,
yielding a significant asymmetry in the electrical characteristics
of the tested OTFTs depending on the polarization of the source and
drain. Recent improvement in laser processing made it possible to
scale down patterning resolution to the 100 nm scale.25 Such innovation paves the route toward the design of masks
and their alignment with such a spatial resolution, ready for device
integration. In a broader view, having an electrode with a favorable
injection for holes and the other one for electrons sets the grounds
for a platform to further develop more complex electronic devices
and functions. Our method opens the possibility to enhance the response
of large-area device architectures through interfacial tailoring of
single electrodes, for applications in LET, OTFTs, inverters, solar
cells, and sensors.

Materials and Methods
Mask for the Evaporation
Fabrication Procedure
A nickel
plate was used to fabricate the evaporation mask. The mask was cut
with the laser marker Marko. It has a short-pulsed Nd:YAG IR laser
centered at λ = 1064 nm. Typical cutting parameters were a laser
power of 8 W and a frequency of 20 kHz. The nickel plate was put freestanding
on the Marko’s stage using four magnets (Figure S1). The stage was moved by the software, which can
move it in the X–Y directions.
The focus was controlled by moving the laser head in the Z direction. The movement was controlled with an accuracy of less
than 1 μm in the X–Y–Z directions. The laser beam was moved over
the surface according to the design input to the software. The optimal
cutting speed was found to be 20 μm s–1. A
total of 25 passages were needed to achieve a complete cut of the
metal plate. A 10 min timescale was necessary to obtain the mask.
The mask was then polished with a polish paste and cleaned with water
and soap. Finally, a sonication in ethanol for 10 min was performed
to ensure complete removal of all the remaining metallic powder and
polish paste.

Protection Mask for the Electrode Fabrication
Procedure
A polymeric laminated film with glue on one side
was purchased from
3M (product ID 3M-UU003122981). The polymer was put stretched on the
Marko’s stage and cut with a power of 3 W, 20 kHz at 20 μm
s–1. All other details have been described in the
previous paragraph. Two scans were needed to obtain the cut, in a
process lasting 2 s for each mask.

Electrode Fabrication and
Functionalization
First,
5 nm of Cr and then 45 nm of gold were evaporated through the evaporation
mask on a n++-Si/SiO2 substrate (Fraunhofer IPMS). They
consisted of n++-Si substrates with 230 nm of thermally grown SiO2 as the gate dielectric (15 nF capacitance). The doped silicon
layer can act as a gate electrode, whereas the silicon oxide layer
can act as a dielectric. They were ozone cleaned for 5 min, followed
by 25 min of incubation. The protective mask was placed over one of
the two electrodes covering it completely. The mask was manually placed
on it, with the help of a long focal microscope. In a cylindrical
weighing bottle, 3 μL of DT (Sigma) was dissolved in 20 mL of
EtOH. Then, the sample was placed in the solution. After 36 h, it
was cleaned with warm ethanol, chloroform, and 2-propanol. The mask
was then removed, and the sample was cleaned again with 2-propanol.
In another cylindrical weighing bottle, 5 mg of PFDT (Sigma) was dissolved
in 10 mL of EtOH. The sample without any protective mask was placed
in the solution for 36 h. The sample was then cleaned by squirting
warm ethanol, chloroform, and 2-propanol. To ensure complete removal
of the mask residues, the sample was sonicated in toluene for 10 min
at 60 °C. The final sample was then cleaned with 2-propanol,
followed by drying under nitrogen flow.

OTFT Fabrication
A 5 mg mL–1 solution
of P3HT in chloroform was prepared and continuously stirred for 1
h at 35 °C to ensure complete solubilization. A volume of 150
μL of the solution was spin-coated (3000 rpm, 1500 rpm s–2, 60 s) on the samples and annealed at 50 °C
for 2 h.
