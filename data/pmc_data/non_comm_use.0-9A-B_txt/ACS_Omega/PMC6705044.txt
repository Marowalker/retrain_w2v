A periodically
precipitating system wherein interband distance
successively decreases is known as revert Liesegang banding. The phenomenon
is rare, and the underlying mechanism is implicit. In the present
paper, the Liesegang system comprising of AgNO3 and KBr
as the outer and inner electrolyte pair showing revert banding in
agar gel by employing a 1D experimental setup is studied under varying
concentrations of participating species. Revert banding was observed
under all the experimental conditions. The concentrations of inner
and outer electrolytes were found to play a major role in reverting
since they build the ionic strength inside Liesegang tubes. We hypothesize
that the band reverting is the interplay of van der Waals and electrical
double-layer interactions, and hence classical DLVO (Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek)
theory can be applied to interpret reverting. We propose that revert
deposition of precipitates is the outcome of flocculation and peptization
of sols, which is the manifestation of balancing attractive and repulsive
interactions acting on colloidal particles responsible for band formation.

Introduction
Self-assembled (SA)
patterns are widely distributed in the living
and nonliving world. Many of these phenomena are periodic in nature.
Some of the examples of periodic formation are concentric orbits of
the planets in the solar system (physical), protein crystallization
(biological),1 stratification of minerals
in rocks (geological),2 and periodic self-assembly
of nanomaterials (chemical).3 The underlying
mechanism of many of these formations is explicit, although many of
them still remain a mystery. One of the most fascinating SA patterns
that can be easily exhibited in a laboratory is the periodic precipitation
in gels called Liesegang banding. The Liesegang pattern is a spontaneous
self-assembly of precipitates in the form of discs or bands at regular
spaces in gel due to Brownian motion of the diffusing species.4 The bands are formed as a result of reaction–diffusion
interactions at the interface. The patterns appear as concentric rings
in a circular (2D) geometry and bands in a linear geometry (1D). One-dimensional
(1D) Liesegang patterns can be obtained by immobilizing one of the
reactants (inner electrolyte) in the gel supported in a glass tube
of appropriate dimensions held in a vertical position. The other reactant,
namely, the outer electrolyte, is poured from the top of the glass
tube and is allowed to diffuse through the gel. As the diffusion front
proceeds, the precipitate is deposited in the form of bands at specific
distances.5,6 A large number of Liesegang systems consisting
of hydroxides,7,8 sulfides,9 chromates and dichromates,10 and phosphates11,12 are reported.

It has been explicitly shown that Liesegang
patterns obey few generic
spacio-temporal laws related to interband spacing, widths of the bands,13 and time of their formation.14 The most common being the spacing law15 is given by  where x is the
distance
of the band from the gel–outer electrolyte interface, n is the band number, and p is the spacing
coefficient. It has been observed that, under a given set of experimental
conditions, the spacing coefficient is the function of the initial
concentrations of the inner and outer electrolytes (a0 and b0, respectively) as
shown by the Matalon–Packter law16,17 given by  where F and G are the decreasing functions of the initial concentrations. It is
observed that two types of Liesegang patterns are experimentally observed:
(1) direct ring formation in which the gap between two successive
bands go on increasing and (2) revert or inverse banding wherein the
gap between two successive bands would decrease in the downward direction
of diffusion. While the experimental and theoretical studies on the
former are overwhelming, comparatively much less attention has been
given to the latter as reverse patterns are rarely observed. Liesegang
systems consisting of precipitates of Ag2CrO4,18 AgI,19 CuS,20 HgS,21 and PbCrO422,23 have been reported to exhibit revert banding.

There are three prominent theories to explain the Liesegang phenomenon,
namely, the supersaturation theory, the adsorption theory, and the
coagulation theory.24 A few theories based
on adsorption of precipitating ions on the precipitate itself were
proposed to explain revert banding. In order to explain revert patterns,
it was thought that the diffusing electrolyte renders a high peptizing
influence or dissolves the precipitate formed as a result of a reaction
between the two participating ions. The decrease in the concentration
of the peptizing ion along with the diffusion path results in “reverting”
the system of rings.18,25 Kanniah et al.19 obtained the revert patterns followed by a direct one in
a single experiment using various concentrations of KI and AgNO3 as inner and outer electrolytes, respectively. They proposed
that Ag+ ions are adsorbed on AgI creating a positively
charged sol, Ag+@AgI. This leads to the formation of an
electrical double layer implicating that the Ag+ ions peptize
the sol. The peptizing capacity is directly proportional to the concentration
of Ag+ ions. As the diffusion progresses in the downward
direction, the peptizing ability decreases the sol leading to reverting
of the system of bands. Molnar et al.26 provided the theoretical model and corresponding simulation for
the adsorption theory of reverting.

The Liesegang system consisting
of chromates of lead and copper
showed the revert banding due to a photochemical process. Authors
of this study proposed that exposure to electromagnetic radiation
led to photoactivation of AgCrO4 resulting in a high degree
of ionization. The charged atmosphere inside the Liesegang tube was
responsible for high nucleation rates and hence revert banding.27,28 It was thought that an autocatalytic process due to adsorption of
diffusing ions of the outer electrolyte can lead to a revert periodic
precipitation of lyophilic CdS.29

The most intriguing consequence of revert banding is the challenge
for universal applicability of the Matalon–Pacter law to Liesegang
banding. It is understood that the spacing coefficients obtained in
revert banding systems do not follow the Matalon–Pacter law,
which has emphasis on the dependence of p on decreasing
functions of the initial concentrations of outer and inner electrolytes.30 Hence, there is a need for a new type of spacing
law that can be applied to both types of patterning. It was observed
that the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) or the flocculation
value of each band in the KI–AgNO3 system decreases
with the band number leading to reverting. However, it was noted that,
from a particular band, the CCC value started to increase.29−31 The region of reversal of the potential is an isoelectric region.
It was pointed out that, from this region onward, a direct pattern
formation is observed.31

A few experimental
studies were also performed to propose the mechanism
of revert spacing in a PbCrO4 system, It was concluded
that adsorption of diffusing CrO4– ions
on the precipitate of PbCrO4 is responsible for reverting.22 It was observed that the extent of adsorption
increases with the band number while it decreases in the direct type
of the Liesegang system.23,32

Therefore, essentially,
almost all the available reports on the
revert periodically precipitating systems support the mechanism of
specific ionic adsorption of diffusing ions on the sol/precipitate
leading to a decrease in the band gap. However, the following facts
remain to be explained: (1) the layered/continuous adsorption of the
ions on the precipitate should lead to thickening of the band as there
is extra precipitate deposition thereby changing the morphology (bandwidths)
of the system irrespective of the concentration of ions in the band.
No reports are available on the width law of the revert banding system.
(2) The most common systems, namely, those of AgI and PbCrO4, form negative and positive sol, respectively; therefore, the adsorption
of diffusing Ag+ and CrO4– on AgI and PbCrO4, respectively, is predicted. Such deposition
leads to the formation of an electrical double layer around the precipitate,
and as all the species taking part in the adsorption are charged,
the electric double layer interaction should influence banding. (3)
As early coagulation of the sol particles is responsible for revert
banding, the attractive van der Waals (vdW)33 interactions may also be playing a role in the sol stability. vdW
interactions are not considered in the adsorption mechanism, and (4)
the role of the gel in the reverting is not considered; however, it
is realized that its concentration changes the band gaps.22

In view of this, it is important to understand
the role of operating
interactions among the sol particles in band reverting. If attractive
vdW interactions are dominant over repulsive double-layer interactions,
then there will be coagulation, and the result is a continuous band
formation inside the tube rather than stratification. Also, if repulsive
forces are dominant over attractive forces, then the molecules of
the precipitating substance do not form sol particles. In the case
of dominant repulsive interactions, the molecular species formed as
an outcome of a chemical reaction between inner and outer electrolytes
also diffuses in the downward direction along with the ions of the
outer electrolyte. If their concentration reaches the threshold, then
there is a formation of direct bands as predicted by ion-product supersaturation
theories, which propose that the supersaturation of diffusing ions
triggers nucleation.34−37 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that revert banding is the
outcome of the balancing of these two types of interactions. The individual
interactions can be determined on the basis of DLVO theory. In the
present paper, we report detailed experimental investigations on the
Liesegang system consisting of AgNO3 and KBr as the outer–inner
electrolyte pair. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed
on this system exhibiting revert banding. An attempt is made to unravel
the mechanism of reverting on the basis of attractive and repulsive
interactions among the sol particles.

Results and Discussion
Evidence
for Revert Spacing in the AgNO3 + KBr System
Effect of
Outer Electrolyte Concentration
Concentrations
of outer and inner electrolytes were carefully chosen for the experiments
as it is known that excessive ionic strength will lead to continuous
precipitation and, with lower concentrations, band formation is difficult.7 Therefore, we have chosen the inner and outer
electrolyte concentrations in such a way that the ionic strength inside
the diffusion tube remains in the range of 0.20 to 0.60 M. The concentrations
were below the critical coagulation concentration, CCC (0.900 to 1.000
mol L–1) as determined by using DLVO theory neglecting
the contribution due to gel counterions if any, and with the above
CCC, the continuous precipitation is expected. The CCC will be determined
later.

Figure 1a shows the photographs of revert bands of AgBr when the concentration
of the outer electrolyte is varied in the range of 0.30 to 0.50 M.
It can be seen from Figure 1a that the bands are curved up in the top and curved down
in the bottom portion of the tube as the CCD camera was placed near
the tube while the photograph was being taken. However, this does
not affect the “distance analysis” as the traveling
microscope was focused on the band center while locating the band.

of the outer electrolyte concentration. For (i), (ii), and (iii),
AgNO3 concentrations were (i) 0.500, (ii) 0.400, and (iii)
0.300 mol L–1. The inner electrolyte and gel concentrations
were 0.005 mol L–1 and 1.000%, respectively. (b,
c, d) Interband distance and U values calculated
for each band. The decreasing trend indicates revert banding. The
error bars shown in the figure indicate the standard deviation obtained
from measurements.

The concentrations of
the inner electrolyte (KBr) and the gel were
0.01 M and 1.00% w/v, respectively. The AgBr bands are gray in color
due to photochemical decomposition of AgBr to Ag0 as shown
in the following reaction: 2AgBr →hν
2Ag0 + Br2.38Figure 1b–d shows
the interband distance and a new parameter defined as U = (Δx + W)/2 where Δx is the interband distance and W is the
band width, plotted against the number of rings showing a decreasing
trend confirming revert periodic precipitation.22 However, it should be noted that the confirmation of revert
banding based on U and Δx values
may be erroneous as determination of the exact band width is often
difficult due to diffused band boundaries.

Effect of Inner Electrolyte
Concentration
Figure 2a shows the photographs
of Liesegang bands obtained by varying the concentration of KBr in
the range of 0.005 to 0.015 M. The concentrations of AgNO3 and the gel were 0.500 M and 1.000%, respectively. Figure 2b–d shows the interband
distance and U as defined earlier and interband distance
(Δx) versus band number plots indicating the
revert banding under this condition also.

Liesegang patterns showing the effect

KBr concentrations were 0.005, 0.010, and 0.015 mol L–1 respectively. The outer electrolyte and gel concentrations were
0.500 mol L–1 and 1.000%, respectively. (b, c, d)
Plots of the interband distance, U value, and band number. The decreasing
trend in the value indicates revert banding. The error bars shown
in the figure indicate the standard deviation obtained from three
measurements.

Effect of Gel Concentration
Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the photographs of the bands
by varying the concentration of the agar gel in the range of 0.50
to 1.50% (w/v). The concentrations of outer and inner electrolytes
were 0.50 and 0.05 mol L–1, respectively. Previously,
it was observed experimentally that the gel concentration has a considerable
effect on revert spacing as it offers obstruction for the diffusion
of the outer electrolyte.39 This process
causes the bands to precipitate further away from the preceding one.
In present studies, the gel plays no role in the reverting of the
bands unlike as observed by Sultan et al.22 in their system of revert banding. It is known that ionic strength
directly affects the pore size distribution of the agar gel. We have
calculated that the mean ionic strength in our experiments lies in
the range of 0.30 to 0.60 M, indicating the average gel pore size
of 500 to 700 nm.40 The diameters of Ag+ and NO3– ions are 230 and 330
pm, respectively.41 With the gel concentration
in the range of 0.5 to 2.0%, the gel pore size remains in the same
range; hence, as far as our system is concerned, it has a very small
effect on band location. However, it should be noted that, with larger
ionic sizes, the gel obstruction effect may play a significant role
in band location. It is also possible that gel counterions also play
a role. The small variation observed in the spacing pattern with the
gel concentration needs further mechanistic investigations, which
is being studied in our laboratory.

Effect of Light on the
Banding Pattern
As silver halides
are photosensitive, a control experiment, which was performed in the
absence of light, also showed revert banding, but the color of the
bands was different from that observed in the experiments performed
in the presence of light due to a photochemical process (see the Supporting
Information, Figure S2). Das et al.27 found that photoactivation of chromate ions
is essential for the reaction to take place and further band formation;
however, in the present study, the reactor ions are not photosensitive,
but the product is. Hence, revert bands are formed first followed
by photodecomposition to Ag0. Hence, it can be inferred
that revert banding is observed in the presence as well as in the
absence of light.

It can be observed from Figures 1 and 2 and Figure S1 that revert banding is obtained under
all experimental conditions; however, a number of bands formed depended
on the concentration of participating species. The bands formed in
all the systems were well resolved. The reaction mechanism for band
formation involves the following steps according to Ostwald’s
sol-coagulation theory.16,26,31 The floc formed in the final step deposits in the tube as bands. 1   2   3  

Step 1, shown in the above reaction sequence,
is instantaneous
as AgBraq is formed when the concentration product of Ag+ and Br– exceeds their solubility product.
However, steps 2 and 3 are comparatively slow; hence, deposition of
the precipitate as bands depends on the ionic strength inside the
column.7,42 All the steps leading to Liesegang bands,
such as sol formation, their flocculation to deposit as bands, and
the distance between bands, should be discussed in the view of interactions
among the precipitated colloidal particles. In the present work, we
have determined values of the attractive van der Waals (EvdW) and repulsive electrical double layer (EDL) energies under the premises of classical DLVO theory
to explain stability (or instability) of the sols responsible for
resultant reverting of the Liesegang bands.

van der Waals Interaction
Energy (EvdW)
Unceasing movement
of charges associated with atoms, molecules,
and bulk materials give rise to van der Waals forces. Being attractive
in nature, they are considered to be responsible for flocculation
of colloidal particles. In the present system, the AgBr colloid is
assumed to be spherical in nature. Therefore, it can be imagined that
two colloidal spheres interact with each other with nonretarding van
der Waals forces. The interaction energy, EvdW, is given by 4  where AH (=
30 × 10–20 J for silver) is called the Hamaker
constant, R1 and R2 (= 5 ×
10–9 m) are the radii of colloidal particles, and h is the distance between the two interacting particles.43,44 The h values were taken in the range of 0.10 to
2.00 nm. The effect of h on EvdW is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Interaction energies among the particles calculated using van der
Waals energy, eq 4 (EvdW), electrical double layer energies with
varying ionic strengths, eq 5 (EDL-1 to 3),
and DLVO energies calculated using eq 7.

Electrical Double Layer
Interaction Energy (EDL)
It is
known that the AgBr sol particles are
negatively charged; hence, positive ions available in the vicinity,
that is, Ag+ and K+, would adsorb on the sol
surface. This gives rise to electrical double layer interactions (EDL). These interactions are repulsive or attractive
depending on the nature of the surface potential. The value of EDL depends on the properties of the surrounding
medium such as ionic strength, pH, type of metal ions, etc. It should
be noted that the movement and concentration of charged particles
can be very influential during colloidal flocculation and peptization.
The EDL in the present work is calculated
using the equation39 5  where ε0 is
the relative permittivity of the medium, R is the
radius of the colloidal particle (= 5 nm), ψs is
the surface charge, and κ is the Debye screening length. In
the present work, the value of the surface potential, ψs, was taken to be 50 mV,45,46 and κ
for the 1:1 symmetric electrolyte (AgNO3 in the present
case) is calculated using the equation 6  where [I]
is the ionic strength in the medium.39,40

According
to classical DLVO theory, the net interaction energy (ED) among the colloidal particles is given by 7  Figure 3 shows the ED, EvdW, and EDL as
functions of interparticle distance. It can be seen that the
primary minima is observed at smaller h values (0.10
to 0.12 nm). At h values beyond 0.70 nm, EvdW saturates around −1 × 10–20 J. Values of EDL are
calculated using the ionic strengths for the electrolyte concentration
values in the range of 0.3 to 2.0 M. Using the surface potential of
50 mV, it can be seen that the double layer energy values decrease
monotonically with interparticle distance and also decrease with the
increase in the electrolyte concentration. The net interaction energy, ED, peaks at 0.30 to 0.40 nm. It can be observed
that the critical coagulation concentration (the electrolyte concentration
at which the peak barrier has ED = 0 and
also dED/dh = 0) is in
the range of 0.900 to 1.000 mol L–1 electrolyte.
In our studies, the chosen electrolyte concentrations were in the
range of 0.30 to 0.60 mol L–1, which is less than
that of theoretically determined CCC (which is 0.90 to 1.00 mol L–1); hence, spontaneous coagulation of the precipitate
to form a continuous band is not possible. The energy barrier value
for the lowest electrolyte concentration is 1.05 × 10–20 J at 0.30 nm corresponding to 2.56 kT.

It is established that
coagulation and peptization behavior of
an aggregate can be explained within the DLVO framework. According
to this theory, coagulation of the sol and its peptization can be
understood from the viewpoint of competition between EvdW forces that are attractive in nature and EDL forces among the sols that are repulsive in nature.
If the EvdW exceeds the EDL, the sol coagulation takes place, and if the EDL exceeds EvdW, peptization is triggered. For smaller inter-sol
particle distances, the aggregates experience more EvdW forces; however, when the aggregate becomes larger
and deposits in the medium as a band, the EDL forces due to the presence of ionic strength inside the medium lead
to a large surface charge density triggering peptization. This process
makes the diffusing ions thermalize and cross the Stern barrier.

Mechanism of Band Reverting in the AgBr System
The
underlying mechanism of revert Liesegang banding has been under intense
research for many years.18−22 The earliest explanation is on the basis of the zeta potential (ζ).
It is known that if the ζ-potential is lowered below a certain
critical value, agglomeration of colloidal particles is triggered.
Distortion of the electrical double layer formed around sol by altering
the medium condition such as adsorption of diffusing ions can lead
to lowering of the ζ-potential. Although ζ-potential is
inversely correlated with coagulation, it does not represent the surface
potential (ψs) as shown in eq 5. According to Mathur and Ghosh,18 the decreased concentration of diffusion ions responsible for rendering
peptization along with the diffusion front leads to band reverting.
However, the mechanism of peptization was not clearly discussed. In
the present study, we assume that the flocculation and peptization
is the outcome of interactions among the sol particles, which depend
on surface charges. Hence, DLVO theory is appropriate to explain the
band patterns of the AgBr system. We propose the following mechanism
for the revert system of bands.

Let us consider experiment employing
varying concentrations of AgNO3. At the interface of the
gel–outer electrolyte (i.e., at x = 0), Ag+ ions (consider an experiment in which their concentration
is 0.5 M) are simple Brownian particles, which move in the downward
direction because of thermal motion with kinetic energy (kT) (≈
4.11 × 10–21 J at 298 K). With Ag+ ions, the diffusion front proceeds through the gel, and they meet
Br– ions of the inner electrolyte leading to the
formation of AgBr molecules at a certain distance from the gel–outer
electrolyte interface. If the distance between them is approximately
equal to the first minimum as shown in Figure 3, then attractive van der Waals forces start
operating between the AgBr molecules. We have calculated the net DLVO
energy and van der Waals energy at this stage in the range of −2.34
to −1.70 × 10–20 J using eq 4. These attractive forces enable
AgBr molecules to flocculate triggering the formation of AgBr sol.
The flocculation process continues, and the aggregate deposits at
a specific position. In this way, the first band of the AgBr floc
is deposited. As the AgBr floc formed in first band is negatively
charged, Ag+ ions get adsorbed on its surface. Adjacent
sol particles also having net positive charges repel each other, and
if the distance between them becomes equal to that corresponding to
the energy barrier as shown in Figure 3, Ag+ peptizes the sol. The peptizing Ag+ start to diffuse in the downward direction but with a smaller
number density.

The DLVO theory predicts that the number density
of ions (i.e.,
concentration) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the
surface potential. Hence, as the surface potential decreases, the
repulsion between two sol particles decreases leading to the band
formation, which is nearer the previous one. The above process continues,
and the distance between successive bands decreases with the decrease
in concentration of diffusing Ag+ ions leading to revert
banding. This ion number density or concentration after each band
formation should correspond to a critical coagulation concentration.

Therefore, we propose that the first band is the irreversible deposition
of sol due to van der Waals forces where the distance between the
sol particles corresponds to that of the first minimum shown in Figure
6. The successive bands are formed nearer the previous one due to
the decrease in the concentration of peptizing Ag+ ions
leading to a negative value of the spacing coefficient. It is observed
that the values of the spacing coefficient are directly proportional
to electrolyte concentration. Therefore, obviously, if the concentration
of Ag+ is low, then the number density of peptizing (and
diffusing) ions is smaller, and the band formation would take place
closer to the previous one. We have observed the same trend in all
the experiments performed in the present work. It should also be noted
that the effect due to the inner electrolyte will not affect the revert
band trend as its concentration is the same for all the experiments,
and we have assumed that the K+ and Br– ions are
uniformly distributed inside the diffusion medium.

It is mentioned
previously that the role of counterions present
in the system such as K+, Br– (before
reaction), NO3–, and that originating
from whatever small dissociation of agar gel is negligible. It is
known that the role of any ion that is responsible for flocculation
should be seen from the viewpoint of the Hofmeister series.22,23 According to this series, the coagulating power of cations varies
as Al3+ > Ca2+ > Ni3+ >
Zn2+ > Co2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = Na+. Therefore, obviously, K+ ions
have a minimum coagulation
capacity, and in addition to that, as an inner electrolyte, their
concentration is negligible compared to Ag+. Therefore,
in the present study, we have neglected the role of counterions in
reverting; however, at high concentrations, they may play an important
role in pattern formation.

In the present work, we have attempted
to apply DLVO theory to
understand the mechanism of revert bands of the AgBr system. We have
proposed the reaction mechanism of the AgBr floc formation and its
deposition as bands through series of reactions including the primary
reaction followed by nucleation and finally coagulation of the precipitate.
The coagulation and peptization can be the interplay of van der Waals
and electrical double layer energies based on where revert banding
can be explained; however, explaining direct bands on the basis of
DLVO theory (coagulation theory) needs to be explored. If the band
formation (revert or direct) is believed to be the outcome of supersaturation
or adsorption (and not of nucleation followed by coagulation) of participating
ions at specific locations where the solubility product or electrostatic
interactions are responsible for band formation, then DLVO explanation
needs further investigations.

Conclusions
We
have studied one of the most intriguing self-assemblies of periodic
precipitation where the precipitate of AgBr is deposited in a revert
fashion using a 1D experimental setup. We observed that, under all
three experimental conditions described in the study, the system preserves
revert banding. Theoretical calculations of interacting energies based
on classical DLVO theory could successfully explain the underlining
mechanism of the reverting system. We found that EvdW dominates at the start of band formation (coagulation),
whereas EDL is responsible for the formation
of a new band nearer the previous one due to the peptizing effect
of diffusing ions of the outer electrolyte. This led to the reverting
of system morphology as the threshold concentration (CCC) required
for the next band is reached early. The increase in the spacing coefficient
value is attributed to the ionic strength inside the experimental
tube created by the reactants themselves. However, whether the same
morphology is retained by externally provided ionic strength needs
to be explored.

Experimental Section
An experimental
assembly to obtain Liesegang patterns consists
of a glass tube of known dimensions containing a gel, an outer electrolyte,
and an inner electrolyte. In the present studies, agar gel with a
known weight-per-volume concentration along with AgNO3 and
KBr as the outer and inner electrolyte pair with predetermined concentrations
was used. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without
further purification. Three sets of experiments were performed in
a sequential manner by varying concentrations of the outer electrolyte,
inner electrolyte, or gel. The experimental conditions are summarized
in Table 1.

Typically, the
agar gel was prepared by slow addition of 2 g of
agar powder into 200 mL of boiling water. The required amount of KBr
(as the inner electrolyte) was added to boiling agar solution so that
its final concentration is in the desired range. The boiling liquid
was immediately poured into hard glass tubes with sealed bottoms having
an inner diameter of 7.5 mm and length of 150 mm. Two-thirds of the
glass tube was filled with agar solution. The tube was allowed to
stand vertically overnight at 297.0 ± 0.2 K in a water bath for
gel formation. Next day, after ensuring gel formation, a solution
of AgNO3 (as an outer electrolyte) of known concentration
was poured from the top to fill the remaining one-third of the glass
tube. The open top of the tube was covered with aluminum foil to avoid
concentration change due to solvent evaporation. After pouring AgNO3, a yellow-colored line, which on exposure to light turned
gray, appeared at the gel–outer electrolyte interface indicating
the start of formation of the AgBr precipitate. This line was marked
as the line of contact between gel–outer electrolyte interfaces
(x = 0) for further observations. The tube was allowed
to stand for 10 days. After the observation period, the glass tubes
were photographed using a digital camera. The distances between successive
bands, distances of the band from x = 0, and the
widths of the bands were measured using a traveling microscope within
the accuracy of 0.001 cm7.
