Lanthanide-containing polyoxometalates
(POMs) can be used to detect
various materials, but their luminescence in water has suffered enormous
limitations due to the strong fluorescence quenching. Herein, to resolve
this problem, three-dimensional nanoparticles built by mixed Weakley-type
europium-containing POMs (Na9[EuW10O36]·32H2O, abbreviated to EuW10) and tetra-n-alkyl ammonium (TA) with enhanced fluorescent properties
have been designed in aqueous solution using an ionic self-assembly
(ISA) technique, which is mainly driven by the electrostatic interaction
between EuW10 and TA. The morphology and fluorescent properties
of the system as well as some influencing factors (alkyl chain length,
amino group, and inorganic salt concentration) were systematically
investigated. The results indicated that the fluorescent intensity
of EuW10/tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB) composite increased
about 14 times, whereas the extent of increase of fluorescence for
EuW10/tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) and EuW10/tetrabutylammonium bromide (TMAB) composites gradually decrease
due to the bulkier steric hindrance of the longer alkyl chain. Besides,
the luminescence of EuW10/TMAB nanoparticles is pH responsive,
and the reversibility of their structures and luminescence can be
realized upon the addition of NaOH/HCl. Moreover, the EuW10/TMAB system also shows great fluorescence-sensing behavior, which
could detect Cu2+ with a detection limit of 0.15 μM.
Our work provides a facile construction strategy for a functional
fluorescent complex via POMs-based supramolecular self-assembly in
aqueous solution, which will be further used in biomarkers and sensors.

Introduction
The detection of biologically
and environmentally related heavy
metal ions (Cd2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, etc.)
is crucial due to their important roles in biological processes and
hazard to the environment.1 Among various
heavy metals, copper is an essential trace element for living systems.
The excess of unbound Cu2+, the natural form of free copper
in biological media, is quite harmful and can even cause various neurodegenerative
diseases. Meanwhile, Cu2+ may be a common pollutant of
drinking water that affects water quality and leads to multifarious
infections.2,3 Until now, the approaches for Cu2+ ion detection reported are inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES), atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively
coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and voltammetry. However,
these approaches are time consuming, expensive, and quantitative;
thus, it is necessary to develop a new method for the detection of
Cu2+ ions.

For the past few years, the development
of a range of smart fluorescence
materials including transition-metal complexes,4,5 organic
dyes,6 inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals,7,8 carbon dots,9,10 and lanthanide-doped upconverting
nanoparticles11,12 have attracted particular attention.
These fluorescent compounds have great demand in optoelectronics,
lighting, and so forth;13,14 especially, fluorescent
probing or sensing is now becoming an effective detection modality.
Fluorescence detection is a highly versatile spectroscopic method
with a short response period, high sensitivity, technical simplicity,
and extensive applicability, which can be widely used at real time
and in situ.15 Therefore, it is a vital
challenge to explore a robust fluorescent material with excellent
sensitivity, selectivity, and a rapid response time for Cu2+ ions.

Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a well-known class of environment
friendly
and structurally well-defined nanosized metal-oxide clusters with
significant applications in optics, catalysis, electronics, magnetics,
and biomedicine.16−23 Especially, lanthanide (Ln) group element-doped polyoxometalates
are of great importance in the fluorescence field because of their
excellent photoluminescence properties, such as narrow emission bands,
long lifetime, large Stokes shift, tunable emission, and abundant
valence electrons in f orbitals.24,25 Thus, Ln3+-doped nanoscale POM composite materials are suitable as
fluorescent sensors to detect heavy metal ions.26

Although lanthanide-containing POMs (such as Na9[EuW10O36]·32H2O, abbreviated
to EuW10) have excellent fluorescent properties,27 the biggest problem is the quenched emission
in water solution
due to the ubiquitous O–H vibrations.28,29 To solve this problem, using the concept of self-assembly to suppress
such quenching is a powerful methodology. Self-assembly is one of
the advanced nanotechnologies used to design novel nanostructures,
which is driven by noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding,
electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, steric effect,
van der Waals force, and π–π stacking,30−33 and can efficiently enhance the fluorescence property. Thus, it
is attractive to improve the fluorescent properties and construct
novel supramolecular nanostructures of lanthanide-containing POMs
through the self-assembly of POMs with other components.

With
these issues in mind, we reported a new aggregate that comprises
Weakley-type lanthanide-containing POMs (EuW10) and tetra-n-alkylammonium (TA), which form well-defined hybrid nanoparticles
with enhanced emission. Moreover, our results further demonstrate
that the fluorescent nanoparticles showed a pH-responsive behavior
and can selectively detect Cu2+ in water with the detection
limit of 0.15 μM, suggesting the potential of the fluorescence
materials for optoelectronic applications and sensing device fabrication.

Results
and Discussion
Phase Behavior of the EuW10/TA
System
First,
the complexes of EuW10 with four different chain lengths
of tetra-n-alkyl ammonium (TA) (n = 1, 2, 4, 6) were constructed. The concentration of EuW10 is maintained at 0.6 mM, whereas that of TA is gradually increased. Figure 1f displayed the phase
behavior of EuW10/TA systems as a function of cTA. It can be observed that all of them share the same
phase behaviors in that the solution phase gradually turned to the
precipitate phase with increasing −cTA, which may be induced by the electrostatic interaction of the oppositely
charged EuW10 and TA. Nevertheless, the difference between
them was that the concentration of TA, the inflection point from solution
to precipitate, was going down with the increase of chain lengths.
It could be explained by the reason that TA with a longer alkyl chain
owns poor flexibility and higher hydrophobicity, which induced the
faster appearance of the precipitate.

Characterization and Analysis of EuW10/TMAB Nanostructures
For the pellucid EuW10/TMAB solution, there was a typical
Tyndall phenomenon when a laser goes through the solution, indicating
the existence of aggregates. Hence, taking the sample of 0.6 mM EuW10/30 mM TMAB as an example, we carried out electron microscopic
research to study the morphology of the aggregates in the EuW10/TMAB system. Nanoparticles with diameters varying from 90
to 300 nm were clearly detected in the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Figure 2a,b. The structure of the nanoparticles
was clearer with atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses (Figure 2c), which implied
that their corresponding diameters are larger than their vertical
heights (20–150 nm) by three to five times, indicating an oblate
sphere structure. Besides, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of EuW10, EuW10/TMAB, and TMAB were
analyzed to explain the atomic interaction vibration, and the results
are shown in Figure 2d. The bands at around 2960, 2914, and 1486 cm–1 are assigned to asymmetric stretching vibrations, symmetric stretching
vibrations, and C–H bending vibrations of the methyl groups
in TMAB, respectively.35,36 The bands in the low-frequency
region are attributed to the vibrations of EuW10 (Figure 2e); to be specific,
the characteristic vibration bands are listed as follows: ν
(W = Od, 943 cm–1), ν (W–Ob–W, 844 cm–1), and ν (W–Oc–W, 784/703 cm–1), where Ob represents the bridged oxygen of two octahedra with a shared corner,
Oc is the bridged oxygen of two octahedra with an edge
shared, whereas Od is the terminal oxygen.37 These peaks moved to 921, 833, 789, and 671 cm–1 for the complex after the assembly with TMAB, confirming that electrostatic
interaction and hydrogen bonding may be the main driving forces for
successful hybridation.38

(c) AFM images of 0.6 mM EuW10/30 mM TMAB nanoparticles;

cm–1) spectra of (d). (f) Zeta potential (ζ)
of the aqueous solution with different cTMAB, while cEuW10 = 0.6 mM.

To further verify the existence
of electrostatic interaction, the
ζ-potential of the EuW10/TMAB system was measured
to further study the evolution of the assembly behavior. The results
in Figure 2f revealed
that the ζ-potential values of EuW10/TMAB system
increased from −35.6 to −11.2 mV when the concentration
of TMAB increased. The increasing trend of the ζ-potential confirmed
that electrostatic interaction between EuW10 and TMAB was
the dominant interaction of self-assembly. Moreover, the negative
value of ζ indicated that the interaction of POMs and TA is
weaker than that with other surfactants, and thus the cationic TA
did not displace all countercations of the EuW10, and the
EuW10 was located in the shell of the nanoparticles’
structure.39 Moreover, as the UV–vis
absorption spectra show (Figure S1A), the
absorption peak value at 260 nm of EuW10/TMAB decreased
compared with pure EuW10, which further proved the formation
of small and dense aggregates.40

Fluorescence
Behavior of the EuW10/TMAB System
POMs with rare
earth elements doped have more prominent photoluminescent
advantages than other inorganic fluorescent nanomaterials.41 In our system, although EuW10 powder
has excellent fluorescence property in the solid state, the emission
of EuW10 in aqueous solution is quite weak. Hence, it would
be significant if the fluorescence of the EuW10/TMAB system
can be improved compared with pure EuW10 aqueous solution.
Then, taking the EuW10/TMAB system as an example, we conducted
a series of measurements to study its fluorescence performance. The
photographs of 0.6 mM EuW10 aqueous solution and EuW10/TMAB with varied cTMAB under
254 nm UV light are shown in Figure 3A; it can be found by the naked eye that the luminescence
of EuW10/TMAB enhanced obviously as cTMAB increased gradually, and the confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) image (Figure 3B) exhibiting red shining dots further verified the great fluorescence
performance of the EuW10/TMAB system.

solutions of ratio-dependent complexes
with EuW10 fixed at 0.6 mM under 254 nm UV irradiation
(from a to g, cTMAB/cEuW10 = 0, 1, 9, 20, 30, 40, and 50). (B) CLSM

and (D) the corresponding intensity ratios of 594–621 nm (I594/I621) of EuW10 (0.6 mM) with different concentrations of TMAB. (E) Time-resolved
fluorescence decay curves of EuW10 (0.6 mM) before and
after binding with TMAB. The experiment was performed at 25 °C,
and the samples were excited at 265 nm.

Figure 3C presents the emission spectra of
EuW10 and EuW10/TMAB in aqueous solution with
excitation wavelengths at 265 nm. The emission spectrum of pure EuW10 aqueous solution displayed four main characteristic transitions
of Eu3+ ions from 570 to 720 nm and were ascribed to 5D0 → 7Fj (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions at 594, 621, 651,
and 699 nm, respectively, caused by intramolecular energy transfer
from the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band of O →
W to the photoluminescent Eu3+ core, and the emission originated
from the 5D0 excited states relaxing to the 7Fj ground state eventually.42,43 As the TMAB was added to the EuW10 solution, the fluorescence
intensity enhanced significantly, whereas the emission bands remained
unchanged, corresponding to the phenomenon observed under UV lamp.
It is worth noting that the maximal luminescence of the EuW10 composite was observed in the sample with 30 mM TMAB, and the intensity
of the 5D0 → 7F1 transition band increased by about 14 times compared with the discrete
EuW10 solution. Hence, the remarkably enhanced fluorescence
demonstrated that for the EuW10/TMAB system, EuW10 was located in a comparatively hydrophobic microenvironment where
the cationic TMAB exhibited powerful affinity to the anionic EuW10 to take the place of water ligands by electrostatic interaction,44 and thus enhanced the energy of the LMCT to
Eu3+.45

In addition, to
the best of our knowledge, the relative intensity
ratio of 5D0 → 7F1 transition to 5D0 → 7F2 transition is often applied to assay the symmetry variation
degree of the Eu3+ coordination microenvironment of different
systems.46 As shown in Figure 3D, the ratio of I594/I621 for EuW10 alone was calculated to be 0.87, whereas for the EuW10/TMAB mixed system, it improved to 1.62 at 30 mM TMAB, suggesting
that the Eu3+ in complexes is located at a higher symmetry
microenvironment.47 What’s more,
the time-resolved fluorescent spectra of EuW10 before and
after binding with TMAB were analyzed to gain an in-depth insight
into the mechanism of fluorescence enhancement. Figure 3E illustrates the luminescence decay curves
of the fluorescence intensity monitored at 594 nm, which was a biexponential
decay and showed two different lifetimes and proportions as summarized
in Table S1.48 It can be found that the measured lifetime was gradually longer
in the wake of the increase of the TMAB proportion. Compared with
pure EuW10 (τave = 2.051 ms), the longest
average lifetime of EuW10/TMAB (1:50) reached 2.582 ms,
and these observed results confirmed the formation of compact self-assemblies
because of strong electrostatic interactions between TMAB and EuW10, and replacing the water ligands of Eu3+ by TMAB
is the main contributor to the emission enhancement of EuW10.49

Influencing Factors for
the Fluorescence Behavior of the EuW10/TA System
The factors of alkyl chain lengths, amino
group, and inorganic salt have a certain effect on the fluorescence
behavior. Replace TMAB to TEAB and TBAB with longer alkyl chain lengths,
the emission intensity decreased gradually as shown in Figure 4A,B. The lower luminescence
enhancement for longer alkyl chains suggested weaker electrostatic
interaction and looser aggregation of the EuW10/TA system.
The corresponding ratio of I594/I621 for EuW10/TA also decreased and
the measured lifetime became shorter as the alkyl chain lengths increased
(Figure 4C,D). In addition,
the relevant electrical conductivity and ζ-potential values
in Figure S2 decreased clearly. All of
these demonstrated that the Eu3+ in a longer alkyl chain
system was located in a lower-symmetry microenvironment. This may
be because the steric hindrance effect as well as nonpolarity of alkyl
chains increase as the cationic alkyl chain length increases, which
hinders the electrostatic interaction between EuW10 and
TA and induces less fluorescence enhancement consequently.35,50 Above all, the formation mechanism of EuW10/TA nanoparticles
in the presence of different alkyl chain lengths of TA are summarized
in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Formation Mechanism of EuW10/TA Nanoparticles in the Presence
of Various Alkyl Chain Lengths of TA
What’s more, the effects of the amino group and
inorganic
salt on the fluorescence behavior were also studied. As shown in Figure 4E, the luminescence
of EuW10/TMPB had increased in comparison with pure EuW10 solution, but the intensity was much lower than that of
EuW10/TMAB. It illustrated the existence of the more ordered
arrangement between N+ and EuW10 than P+ and EuW10 in the self-assembly atop the active
layer.51 As for the sensitiveness of EuW10/TMAB system to ionic strength, it can be seen that for the
same ratio of EuW10/TMAB and EuW10/NaBr solution,
the latter emission intensity is lower, but is higher than that of
pure EuW10 solution (Figure S3A,B). However, when NaBr was added to the EuW10/TMAB system,
the fluorescence intensity became weaker than that of EuW10/TMAB (Figure 4F),
which proved that the increase of ionic strength destroyed the original
assemblies. This is because the added salt might compress or shield
the electrical double layer and weaken the electrostatic interaction
of EuW10 and TMAB.24

Response
to pH of the EuW10/TMAB System
Stimuli-responsive
POM-based supramolecular materials with multiple
functions like reversible photoluminescence and self-assembly behavior
in aqueous solution will broaden the potential applications of these
materials. In case of the 0.6 mM EuW10/30 mM TMAB system
(pH = 6.3), the fluorescent property at different pH adjusted by HCl
or NaOH was also analyzed. The fluorescence of the system could be
completely quenched at pH 7.4 and then recovered at pH 6.3 (Figure 5a); in the meantime,
the phase behavior transfers from clear solution to precipitate with
pH from 6.3 to 7.4 and this procedure can reverse over four cycles
with only little loss of fluorescence intensity (Figure 5b). The morphological evolution
by alternating the pH was also investigated in detail. When the pH
increased to 7.4, the nanoparticles disassembled into a disordered
network structure (Figure S4a,b), whereas
the nanoparticles rebuilt when the pH of the system recovered to 6.3.
It has been proved previously that TMAB acts as the cation and can
interact with the EuW10 cluster through electrostatic interaction;
thus, upon treatment with NaOH, the deprotonated amino group weakened
the electrostatic interaction between EuW10 and TMAB and
induced the breakout of nanoparticles.52

Fluorescent Detection of Cu2+
Lanthanide-containing
polyoxometalates are sensitive to ambient chemical environments and
widely used in luminescent sensing or probing.53 In our work, the strong fluorescence intensity of the Eu3+ ions is hypersensitive to the microenvironment. Thereby,
a series of metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Al3+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+) were added to the EuW10/TMAB aqueous solution to explore the possibility of fluorescence
detection. It is obvious from the fluorescence spectra (Figure 6A) that only Cu2+ led to drastic quenching of the fluorescence (95%), which suggested
that the nanoparticles can selectively detect Cu2+ ions.
Aiming to assess the performance of the sensor, the selectivity for
Cu2+ over other metal ions was also studied by competition
experiments in the presence of 30 μM Cu2+ mixed with
other equimolar interfering metal ions (Figure 6B). The results indicated that Cu2+ still induced strong quenching of EuW10/TMAB in the presence
of other tested metal ions.

Figure 6 (A) Fluorescence spectra of 0.6 mM EuW10/30 mM TMAB
with different metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Al3+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, and cmetal = 30 μM). (B) Selectivity of 0.6 mM EuW10/30 mM TMAB toward Cu2+: gray bars denote the
solutions with metal ions and pink bars denote the succedent mix of
Cu2+ to the above solutions (λex = 265
nm, λem = 594 nm, cmetal = 30 μM, cCu2+ = 30
μM). (C, D) Fluorescence spectra of the sample with different
contents of Cu2+.

To further study the sensitivity of the fluorescence sensor
for
Cu2+ ions, the fluorescence spectra as a function of Cu2+ ion concentration were measured. In Figure 6C, the fluorescence intensity of Eu3+ ions gradually decreases with the increase of cCu2+, which can be found by the naked eye under
UV light (inset of Figure 6C). An approximately linear relationship between fluorescence
intensity (λem = 594 nm) and cCu2+ can be obtained when cCu2+ is in the range of 0.2–1.0 μM
(Figure 6D). Thus,
the detection limit was calculated to be ca. 0.15 μM for Cu2+ through the 3σ method, which was much lower than the
EPA-defined safety level of Cu2+ in drinking water (20
μM).54 Moreover, the 1/(I0 – I) value as a function of
1/[Cu2+] displayed a wonderful linear fit (R = 0.998) based on the emission intensity changes, and the binding
constant (K) calculated according to the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation was close to 4.65 × 103 M–1 (Figure S5).55

To explore the nature (static or dynamic) of the fluorescence
quenching
of Cu2+, the relationship of the plot of I0/I (I0 and I, fluorescence intensity of EuW10/TMAB with
and without Cu2+) with Cu2+ concentration was
studied and it showed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9815) (Figure S6). Based
on the modified Stern–Volmer relationship (I0/I = KSV [Cu2+] + C) in which KSV is the Stern–Volmer’s constant and [Cu2+] is the concentration of Cu2+, the dynamic nature
of the fluorescence quenching in our system can be proved.56 Hence, the mechanism of the fluorescence quenching
was speculated to be energy transfer.57 Then, the reversibility of the quenching upon addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution (2 mM, 30 μL) to the Cu2+-quenched
EuW10/TMAB solution was checked. The initial fluorescence
can recover in the presence of EDTA solution, suggesting the formation
of a strong complex of Cu2+ with EDTA. Besides, TEM and
FT-IR of EuW10/TMAB before and after the addition of Cu2+ were further compared to investigate the mechanism of the
fluorescence detection of Cu2+ ions (Figure S7). The results showed that both the morphology and
structure were barely affected by Cu2+, indicating that
the energy release from the O → W LMCT excited state transferred
to Cu2+ rather than the 5D0 emitting
state of Eu3+ is the possible reason for the fluorescence
quenching.58 Specifically,
as Cu2+ diffused into the solution and came close to the
Eu3+ ion surface, the energy transfer was more efficient
for the smaller sized nanoparticles and externally distributed EuW10.59

Conclusions
In
our work, the design of notably fluorescence-enhanced solutions
by a cationic component (TMAB) and an anionic cluster POMs (EuW10) by the ionic self-assembly strategy was presented. The
fluorescent emission of the EuW10/TA system revealed a
downward trend as the alkyl chain length of TA increased, which can
be attributed to electrostatic interaction and steric hindrance effect.
What’s more, the EuW10/TMAB complex showed excellent
responsiveness to pH and, most importantly, EuW10/TMAB
composites can act as sensitive fluorescence sensors for Cu2+ in water, providing an environment friendly and real-time rapid
detection method. Our results further proved that the fluorescent
functional materials have unlimited potential in optoelectronic applications
and sensing.
