A comparative
binding interaction of toluidine blue O (TBO) and
methylene blue (MB) with lysozyme was investigated by multifaceted
biophysical approaches as well as from the aspects of in silico biophysics.
The bindings were static, and it occurred via ground-state complex
formation as confirmed from time-resolved fluorescence experiments.
From steady-state fluorescence and anisotropy, binding constants were
calculated, and it was found that TBO binds more effectively than
MB. Synchronous fluorescence spectra revealed that binding of dyes
to lysozyme causes polarity changes around the tryptophan (Trp) moiety,
most likely at Trp 62 and 63. Calorimetric titration also depicts
the higher binding affinity of TBO over MB, and the interactions were
exothermic and entropy-driven. In silico studies revealed the potential
binding pockets in lysozyme and the participation of residues Trp
62 and 63 in ligand binding. Furthermore, calculations of thermodynamic
parameters from the theoretical docking studies were in compliance
with experimental observations. Moreover, an inhibitory effect of
these dyes to lysozyme fibrillogenesis was examined, and the morphology
of the formed fibril was scanned by atomic force microscopy imaging.
TBO was observed to exhibit higher potential in inhibiting the fibrillogenesis
than MB, and this phenomenon stands out as a promising antiamyloid
therapeutic strategy.

Introduction
Binding interaction
of various photoactive organic small molecules
with proteins has evoked great interest in medicinal chemistry. The
nature of protein–ligand binding effects, delivery rate, and
therapeutic efficacy are important information for drug-design and
development. Detailed biophysical studies on the dye–protein
interaction help in understanding the structural features in terms
of the bioaffinity and pharmacokinetic behavior of the dyes on the
protein domain.1−3

Lysozyme (N-acetylmuramide
glyconohydrolase, lyz),
the protein present in abundance in various protective fluids and
lymphatic tissues of most animals, has antimicrobial properties with
the potential to destroy the bacterial cell wall. Lyz has wide utility
as a food preservative also.4,5 Anti-inflammatory, antiviral,
antiseptic, antihistamine, and antineoplastic properties of the protein
are also known. Lyz is a low-molecular (∼14 kDa) globular protein
having α-helix, β-sheet turns, and disordered structural
elements. Its primary structure has 129 amino-acid residues, including
six tryptophan (Trp) and three tyrosine (Tyr) residues and four disulfide
bonds. Six Trp residues are located at the substrate-binding sites,
among these two are located in the hydrophobic matrix box. Studies
have speculated Trp 62 and 108 to be the most supreme fluorophores
in lyz.6−8 Hen egg white lyz shares around 60% homology with
its human counterpart, which is included in hereditary nonneuropathic
systemic amyloidosis.9 Lyz has been used
as a model protein because of its natural abundance, high stabilization,
and compact size for studying the protein-structure principles, function,
dynamics, ligand bindings, and aggregation properties.

It is
necessary to have correctly folded structure of protein for
their biological action to be normal. Most of the diseases, for example,
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Senile
systemic amyloidosis, type II diabetes, and so forth are the root
of abnormal function of proteins, which occurs because of the aggregation
of proteins.10,11 In agreement with various studies,
lyz aggregates under some destabilizing conditions, such as low pH
(pH 2.0) and high temperatures (>50 °C) to form amyloid fibrils.9−12 Recent reports demonstrated that the synthetic lyz fibrils exhibited
nonenzymatic cytotoxicity, including inducing aggregation and hemolysis
of human erythrocytes, triggering intermolecular cross-linking of
cytoskeletal proteins, and reducing the viability of neuroblastoma
cells through apoptotic and necrotic pathways.13,14 Under in vitro conditions amyloid fibrils are produced by generating
harsh conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, acidic or
alkaline pH, or mixing of cosolvents, metal ions, lipid assemblies,
and surfactants.15−17 The rupture of fibrillar assemblies and inhibition
of amyloid formation are the therapeutic blueprint recommended for
the treatment of amyloid-related diseases. Enzymatic inhibitors, antagonists,
antibodies, hormones, small peptides, synthetic ligands, and natural
polyphenols have been probed to be used as antiamyloidogenic agents.
In this context, various polyphenolic compounds reportedly demonstrated
the potential to inhibit the amyloid formation.18,19 Most importantly, lyz protein has effective potential to carry drugs
to the target receptors, and the efficacy of such drug targeting depends
on their binding capacity. For this strategy, interaction of small
organic molecules such as toluidine blue O (TBO) and methylene blue
(MB) with lyz which inhibit the fibril formation have been studied
and have gained great interest.

Toluidine blue O (2-methyl-3-dimethylamino-7-amino-phenothiazin-5-iumchloride)
(Figure 1A) is a phenothiazinium
group planar cationic dye that has anti-tumor activity.20 TBO has some activity on selective cancer cells
and has the potential to be developed as an anticancer drug.21 TBO is widely known to have antimicrobial properties
when used as photosensitizers.22 TBO is
an effective photosensitizer against planktonic bacterial and fungal
growth, which has shown to reduce the cell viability of many microorganisms.23 It has great applications in the field of gynecology
during colposcopy and detection of oral premalignant and malignant
lesions.24,25 It is also used as sensors, biosensors,
polymerization inhibitors, staining agents, photosensitizers to determine
the action of photoactivated microorganisms, and so forth.26−28

Methylene blue (3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-phenothiazin-5-ium
chloride)
(Figure 1B) is also
a phenothiazinium cationic aromatic dye, which has the potential to
stain the nucleic acids and has antimalarial activity. Methylene blue
is widely used as a photosensitizing agent for photodynamic inactivation
of RNA viruses including HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus
in plasma.29,30 Contemporary studies have suggested
that dengue virus can be inactivated by the MB/narrow-bandwidth light
system.31 Also, MB produces singlet oxygen
(1O2) from triplet molecular oxygen in the presence
of light.32

In this work, we have
evaluated the binding interaction of TBO
and MB to lyz using various spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques
and performed molecular docking to predict the binding sites on lyz.
Furthermore, a detailed molecular study of the dye-induced fibril
inhibition in lyz has been characterized. The amyloid fibril formation
from the lyz was investigated by various spectroscopic tools such
as thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence spectroscopy, congo-red (CR) absorption
spectroscopy, and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Conformational
properties of amyloid lyz were analyzed by far UV CD spectroscopy.
Furthermore, a structural and morphological view of lyz fibril was
examined by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) study.

Thus, understanding
the binding characteristics of small molecules
to lyz may provide an insight to develop some new small molecular
inhibitors in the therapy of amyloid diseases.

Results
Fluorescence
Quenching of Lyz Induced by Dye Molecules
Fluorescence studies
are used to evaluate the binding interaction
of small molecules to proteins33−36 because of the influence of photophysical sensitization
of protein fluorophores to surrounding polarity. Lyz contains six
Trp residues at positions 28, 62, 63, 108, 111, and 123 (Figure 1C).33 The residues at positions 28, 108, 111, and 123 are located
in the α-domain and those at positions 62, 63, and 108 are located
in the substrate-binding cleft. Trp-62 and 63 are situated in between
the hinge regions of α and β domains. From the literature
studies, it has been demonstrated that Trp-62 and 63 are the most
exposed residues located at the solvent site and therefore highly
susceptible to chemical modifications.35,37 When lyz is
partially unfolded, Trp-62 and 63 become more exposed to light, consequently
enhancing the intensity of the protein. Trp 62 and 108 residues are
mainly responsible for fluorescence emission of lyz, whereas the residues
at positions 28, 63, 108, 111, and 123 are less emissive. The Trp
63 residue resides closely to the active-site and is not buried in
the hydrophobic core. However, Trp-62 is fully exposed to the solvent
site and Trp-108 is away from the hydrophilic environment.37 Consequently, more exposed Trp-62 and 63 residues
are the main moieties to be affected or quenched by the interaction
of the ligand. Hence, spectral variations of intrinsic fluorescence
characteristics of lyz with TBO and MB dyes may give the finding of
mode of binding interaction. The fluorescence study suggested the
information about the surrounding environmental domain of lyz. For
this purpose, fluorescence experiments were performed with excitation
wavelength at 295 nm, where only Trp residues of lyz are excited,
and it provides the emission spectrum maximum around 336 nm. Figure 2 depicts the intrinsic
fluorescence of Trp moieties of lyz accompanying quenching with the
progressive addition of the dyes, TBO and MB, respectively. In the
titration of TBO and MB with lyz, quenching was observed accompanying
the formation of a new peak at 348 and 347 nm, respectively.

28.03, 33.54, and 50.05 μM of (A) TBO (curves 1–12) and
0, 0.17, 1.20, 3.95, 6.71, 9.46, 14.96, 20.47, 25.97, 31.48, 42.48,
and 53.49 μM of (B) MB (curves 1–12).

Fluorescence quenching occurred mainly by two processes,
static
quenching by complex formation or dynamic quenching due to the collisional
process during photoexcitation.38 In static
quenching, an increase in temperature reduces the stability of the
formed complex, consequently lowering the static quenching constant.
On the other hand, with the increase of temperature, in the case of
dynamic quenching, the number of colliding photoactive molecules is
increased as well as larger the diffusion coefficient, resulting in
the increase of the quenching constant. Therefore, to reaffirm the
quenching mechanism, the fluorescence experiment was done at three
variable temperatures, viz at 288.15, 298.15, and 308.15 K. The quenching
phenomenon was analyzed by the well-known Stern–Volmer equation.38 1  where, Fo and F signifies the fluorescence intensities of lyz (mainly
Trp moiety) at wavelength maxima with and without the presence of
quencher (dyes), respectively. [Q] represents the quencher concentration, Kq denotes the biomolecular quenching constant,
and τo (it is taken to be 108 s–1) is the average lifetime of lyz without the quencher. KSV is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant.

The resulting linear relationship of Fo/F against [Q] primarily shown in Figure 3 suggests that the quenching
is either static or dynamic. Furthermore, the values of Kq and KSV (Table 1) decreased as the experimental
temperature was increased; this result legitimate supported the fact
that the quenching is being governed by the static mechanism. Moreover,
the magnitudes of the Kq values were greater
than 2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1, and this finding also reinforces the prevalence of the static mechanism.33−35

plots at three different temperatures for lyz
quenching by (A) TBO and (B) MB, respectively, are presented.

a All the
data in this table are the
average of four determinations.

The phenothiazinium dyes TBO and MB are highly fluorophore compounds.
Therefore, the effect of lyz on the fluorescence emission of the dyes
was also examined, and the spectra are represented in Figure S1. In both cases, the quenching of emission
spectra also suggested the complex formation at the ground state.

Fluorescence Lifetime Study
Fluorescence lifetime measurements
were performed to distinguish whether the quenching is static or dynamic.39 In static quenching, the measured fluorescence
lifetime values were invariant with the concentration of a quencher,
whereas in dynamic quenching there was a noticeable variation in fluorescence
lifetime data.39 Fluorescence lifetime
measurements along with their amplitudes for free and dye-(TBO/MB)
bound lyz were deduced from their respective time-resolved fluorescence
decay profiles to interpret the dynamics of lyz in the presence of
the dyes. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to be 280 and
337 nm, respectively. The light signal scattered from LUDOX provided
the instrumental response function which was utilized for the deconvolution
of the fluorescence signals. Decay curves of lyz and its complexes
with TBO and MB were fitted with a biexponential function and the
goodness of the fits were evaluated from both the χ2 values and the residuals of the function fitted to the data. Fluorescence
decay is given by40 2  where F(t) = fluorescence intensity
at time t and αi = preexponential factor with respect to
the ith decay time constant, τi. For multiexponential decay, the average lifetime
τavg is given by 3  where τi = fluorescence lifetime
and αi = relative amplitude with i ranging between 1 and
2. For free lyz, the fluorescence lifetimes were deduced to be τ1 = 1.07 ns and τ2 = 2.54 ns, whereas the
fluorescence lifetime were τ1 = 1.11 ns and τ2 = 2.63 ns in the presence of TBO. In the presence of MB,
the fluorescence lifetime values were τ1 = 1.14 ns
and τ2 = 2.88 ns. The Trp residues divulge multiexponential
decays;35 therefore we have not assigned
independent components but the average fluorescence lifetime values
have been reported to obtain a qualitative analysis. Average fluorescence
lifetime of lyz was 1.93 ns, whereas its complexes with TBO and MB
had average fluorescence lifetime values of 1.94 and 1.95 ns, respectively.
Hence, time-dependent fluorescence experiments revealed that the fluorescence
lifetime of free and lyz complexes with the dyes were not significantly
changed. These studies suggested that the quenching of lyz fluorescence
is static in nature and is due to ground state complexation.

Absorbance
Titration
Absorbance spectral titration
was also performed to support the static quenching mechanism and the
absorption changes were recorded in the visible region, that is, in
the 450–800 nm wavelength region. The absorption maxima of
TBO and MB dyes are 633 and 664 nm, respectively. The interaction
of lyz with these dyes is presented in Figure S2. The spectral changes of dye–protein composite systems
supported the argument of dye–protein complex formation in
the ground state.

Binding Parameter Elucidation
Besides
determining the
Stern–Volmer quenching constant (KSV), we can also evaluate the apparent binding constant (KA) and the number of binding sites (n) by the given equation as 4  

From the plot of log[(Fo – F)/F] versus
log[Q], the apparent binding constants (KA) and number of binding sites (n) were calculated
at three variable temperatures and the data are depicted in Table 1. With the increase
of temperature, weakening the apparent binding strength (KA) revealed the static quenching statement as discussed
earlier. The calculated number of binding sites “n” obtained from the above equation was nearly about unity,
indicating only one type of binding site for the binding interaction,
most likely around the Trp residue of the protein.

The quenching
data were quantitatively calculated by the double
reciprocal plot dictated by the Lineweaver–Burk equation33 5  where KLB is the
quenching constant calculated from the ratio of the intercept to the
slope of the Lineweaver–Burk plot, presenting the efficacy
of quenching at the ground state. At three variable temperatures,
from the plot of protein–dye interactions, the data were calculated
and presented in Table 1, and it is revealed that TBO has greater affinity toward lyz than
MB. Moreover, the variation of KLB with
increasing temperature was similar to that of the KSV values. All these results supported the static quenching
phenomenon, which is the driving force for the fall in Trp residual
emission with the increment of the ligand concentration.

Anisotropy
A steady-state anisotropy result implies
the degree of rotational restriction of small molecule binding with
macromolecules. Any modulation in the flexibility or tumbling motion
of the immediate surroundings of the fluorophore probe can be examined
by the anisotropy plot. The anisotropy technique was based on the
principle that larger molecules tumble slower than the smaller molecules,
resulting in an increase in the anisotropy values that correspond
to the increased rotational restriction. From Figure 4, it is shown that binding of dye molecules
to lyz resulted in an increase in the anisotropy value. This indicated
that motional restriction is increased because of strong binding.
Furthermore, the anisotropy value is increased from 0.109 to 0.118
upon binding of TBO to lyz. However, the change in anisotropy is marginal
upon binding of MB to lyz. This observation indicated that rotational
rigidity imposed a larger increase of TBO than MB, resulting in the
stronger binding interaction of TBO with the protein. Moreover, the
binding constant (K) can be measured from the results
of anisotropy (r) of dyes with the binding to lyz
according to Ingersoll and Strollo’s postulate34,41

incremental concentration of lyz. Inset diagram represents corresponding
double reciprocal plots of 1/fb vs 1/[L]

Ingersoll and Strollo describes the following equation as 6  where 7  Here, R is the correction
fraction which is calculated by the ratio of fb to ff, and fb and ff indicate the fractional
fluorescence intensities of the bound and free forms of dyes, respectively. rb and rf are their
corresponding anisotropy. [L] represents the lyz protein concentration
in mM. Using the above relationship, double reciprocal plots of 1/fb versus 1/[L] are plotted and the corresponding
binding constants were calculated from the slopes. The calculated
binding constants of TBO and MB to lyz are deduced to be 1.06 ×
105 and 6.75 × 104 M–1, respectively; these values are in close agreement with those obtained
from spectroscopy measurements.

8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic
acid (ANS) Displacement Study
The ANS displacement study
was performed to locate the preferred
binding region of dye molecules on lyz protein. ANS was used as a
potential probe for getting the information about the hydrophobic
binding sites on the protein.42,43 Studies on binding
of dye molecules to lyz were performed in the presence of ANS keeping
the lyz to ANS ratio as 1:0, 1:1, and 1:10, and the relative intensity
of fluorescence (F/F0) was plotted as a function of concentration of dye molecules. From Figure 5, it is shown that
dye molecules moderately compete with ANS for the hydrophobic binding
region of lyz, and it is higher in TBO than in MB. Thus, TBO binds
more strongly in the hydrophobic site of lyz by displacing the ANS
molecules.

by (A) TBO and (B) MB at various lyz/ANS ratios (1:0, 1:1 and 1:10).

Conformational Changes
of the Protein from Synchronous Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
The ligand binding to lyz causes conformational
changes that can be analyzed by synchronous fluorescence.44 Miller proposed that, if the excitation and
emission wavelength difference (Δλ) are set to be at 15
or 60 nm, the synchronous fluorescence spectra of the protein revealed
a scenario in the polarity change around the Trp and Tyr amino acid
moieties.45 In the binding of lyz to dyes,
there is a systematic decrease in the emission spectra with a large
red shift (8 nm for TBO) and a small blue shift (5 nm for MB) of emission
maxima when Δλ was set to be 60 nm (Figure 6). This is governed by the postulate that
there is a change in the Trp moiety toward the hydrophilic environment
exposing more to the solvent site in the case of TBO, and the corresponding
blue shift signified the reverse phenomenon for Try moieties in MB.46 On the other hand, there is less change in the
emission maxima when Δλ was set to be 15 nm, indicating
that there is little transformation occurred in Tyr moieties. This
finding reinforced that binding of TBO and MB with lyz causes the
change in polarity around the Trp residues and most likely around
Trp-62 and Trp-63. This observation suggested, unequivocally, the
participation of the Trp moieties in the binding process.

of (C) TBO (curves 1–11) and (D) MB (curves 1–11) when
Δλ = 15 nm.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectral Study
CD spectroscopy
is extensively employed to scan the structure, conformation, and stability
of proteins in solution.47 Though CD could
not represent a specific structure of proteins as CD spectroscopy
is considered as a “global reporter”, but it can provide
a guesstimate of fraction of the residues in the lyz protein containing
α-helix, β-sheet, and random coils. Chicken egg white
lyz is an α + β protein with a large α-domain incorporated
with four α-helices and a 310-helix and a smaller
β-domain involving a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet,
and an irregular loop containing two disulphide bridges. Therefore,
lyz contains mostly of α-helix domains. To examine the α-helical
characteristics of lyz, the far UV CD spectrum of native lyz was recorded. Figure 7A,B shows that lyz
contains two minima at 208 and 222 nm, which mainly occurs because
of the α-helical domain.33−35 The 208 nm band occurred because
of the π–π* transition of the α-helix and
the 222 nm band corresponds to the n−π* transition for
both the α-helix and random coil. From the CD spectra, it is
evident that with the increase of dye concentration the CD signals
decreases systematically, suggesting the alteration in the secondary
structure of lyz upon interaction with these dyes. The lowering of
the negative ellipticity values suggested the rupture of the α-helix
content, indicating unfolding of the peptide strand of native protein
on interaction with the dyes. The helical content of the free and
bound lyz molecules was measured in terms of mean-residue ellipticity
(deg cm2 dmol–1) as reported
earlier.48,49 8  where C represents the lyz
concentration at molarity, n is the number of amino-acid
residues, and l denotes the cuvette path length.

Figure 7 Far-UV
spectral changes of lyz (10 μM) with the addition
of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 25 μM of (A) TBO (curves 1–5) and
0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 μM of (B) MB (curves 1–5). Near-UV
spectral changes of 0, 6, 14, 30, and 64 μM of (C) TBO (curves
1–5) and (D) MB (curves 1–5), respectively.

The α-helical values of free lyz and the
corresponding protein
bound by dyes were calculated from the relation as 9  

From the above equation, it was calculated that lyz contains
33.48%
of the α-helix character, which is in good agreement to literature
values.33−35 The α-helical character on dye binding was
reduced and deduced to be 20.25 and 25.36%, respectively, for TBO
and MB. Both the dyes induced strong secondary structural changes
manifested by the loss of α-helix stability. The binding also
caused the unfolding in lyz with the extended polypeptide chains,
revealing the hydrophobic cavities with concomitant exposure of the
aromatic amino-acid residues.

Near-UV CD spectral (Figure 7C,D) experiments
were conducted to decipher the tertiary structural
changes in lyz induced by binding with dyes. In the 250–300
nm region, the CD spectral changes of lyz occurs because of the existence
of Trp, Tyr, and Phe residues and disulphide bonds. The CD spectrum
exhibits three positive peaks near 283, 289 and 295 nm, which corresponds
to the transitions of Trp moieties in lyz.33−35 There were
no drastic changes in this region of CD spectra on interaction of
dyes, indicating that dye molecules do not have much effect to induce
major tertiary structural changes as no break of disulphide bonds
occurred. Though the inference is not conclusive, the CD spectra provide
us an overall estimation of structural changes of protein with the
interaction of dye molecules. Overall, CD spectroscopy and steady-state
fluorescence measurements supported the strong binding interaction
of TBO and MB with lyz protein.

Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) Study
Binding
of small molecules to macromolecules generally alter their thermal
stability by increasing or decreasing their transition temperature Tm (thermal denaturation temperature). To record
the DSC transition temperature (Tm) of
lyz protein in the absence and the presence of TBO/MB, DSC was performed.
DSC also enables the detection of the energetics associated with the
temperature-dependent protein folding–unfolding process.50,51 The DSC transition profile of lyz showed a single endothermic peak
at 339.85 K, and upon complexation with TBO and MB, the transition
temperatures of lyz yielded to be, respectively, 338.0 and 339.3 K
(Figure S3). Therefore, the DSC result
suggested that there is little destabilizing effect of dye molecules
when it binds with lyz.

ITC Study
A quantitative estimation
of the drug–protein
interaction is essential because of its binding propensity, and its
effect on its stability will govern the therapeutic efficiency of
the drug. The ITC thermograms of lyz–TBO and lyz–MB
are presented in Figure 8. In the top panel, each heat burst spikes of raw ITC profiles signifies
single injection of lyz into dye solutions. The bottom panel corresponds
to the actual corrected heat of reaction of lyz–dye binding
after subtracting the heats of dilution. Here, the points manifested
the experimental heats of injection, and the solid lines correspond
to the best fitted isotherms.33−35,52,53 Both the ITC thermograms revealed exothermic
reaction. The ITC data of these dye–protein interactions are
depicted in Table 2. The summarized thermodynamics data and their sign provided a way
to estimate the binding forces of dye–protein interactions.
It is shown from the ITC data that electrostatic interactions are
dominant in the lyz–TBO/MB binding as ΔH < 0 and ΔS > 0.54 In both cases, the interactions are spontaneous in nature
as ΔG < 0. However, TBO is more appropriate
for ionic interactions
as the size and substitutions are comparable with the H-bonding and
induce higher binding affinity in the lyz–TBO interactions.
Thus, the ITC data corroborated the steady-state fluorescence data.
Both the dyes, TBO and MB, bind in a 1:1 ratio as observed from N values (Table 2). Both the bindings were driven by positive entropy changes
with minimum favorable negative enthalpy changes. It is assumed that
large positive TΔS° values
are the outcome of perturbation, release of counter ions, and release
of solvated water molecules from the lyz–dye binding site.55 Moreover, the calculated positive ΔS° and negative ΔH° values
are accountable for the specific electrostatic interactions of TBO/MB
with lyz in aqueous medium.56

a All the data in this table are the
average of three determinations.

At three different temperatures, ITC experiments were performed
to know the nature and vector of forces governing the binding reactions.
From the temperature-dependent ITC experiments, the standard molar
heat capacity changes (ΔCp°) can be determined using
the standard relation as 10  

Binding affinity of dye–protein
interactions decreased with
the increment of temperatures, suggesting that lyz–TBO/MB complex
formation is destabilized at higher temperatures. The variation of
ΔH° against T yielded
ΔCp° for the interactions, which is depicted
in Figure S4. From the slopes of ΔH° versus T, ΔCp° values
are calculated as −4.78 and −2.9 cal/mol K for TBO and
MB, respectively. Negative ΔCp° values are the characteristic
features of many biomolecular interactions.33−35,52,53,57

The nonzero negative ΔCp° values imply
specific changes
involving hydrophobic or polar group hydration on binding of these
dyes to lyz. It is also suggested that the shift of the nonpolar surface
area also contribute to the observed ΔCp° value.58,59 A relatively higher value of ΔCp° indicated
a much higher extent of hydrophobic desolvation effects and conformational
changes in lyz to TBO in conformity with the CD results. The hydrophobic
contributions of binding of TBO and MB to lyz were determined from
the equation, ΔGhyd° = (80 ± 10) × ΔCp°.60 The ΔGhyd° values
are −334.6 and −203.0 cal/mol K, respectively, for TBO
and MB.

Molecular Docking and Dynamic Simulation Study
Our
docking experiments were performed with lyz as the candidate protein,
and the TBO and MB were considered as candidate ligands. The ambient
temperature chosen for the docking studies was 298.15 K. The binding-site
dynamics study revealed that there exists three binding pockets in
lyz (Figure 9A). Among
these, two pockets (green and fade-pink pocket) is of prime importance
in the context of binding to both of the above-mentioned ligands.
One of these pockets consist of both the Trp residues 62 and 63 (green
pocket). Another amino-acid residue Trp 108 is enclosed within another
authoritative pocket (fade-pink pocket). From Figure 9B,C, it was observed that in the most prominent
ligand-bound states, both the ligands have strong interactions with
the above-mentioned two pockets.61 Furthermore,
they were found to be well-organized inside the cleft formed in between
the two pockets. Trp residue 123 lies within another pocket (light-blue)
that barely has significant impact on ligand binding. From Figure 9B,D, it can also
be inferred that TBO has strong interaction with the green pocket
zone because almost all the immediately near residues of this candidate
ligand belong to that pocket. Similarly, Figure 9C,E manifests the interaction of MB with
the residues in or near to the pink pocket when it is embedded into
the cleft. From the protScale output plot, we could infer that in
both the cases, the immediate interacting residues are hydrophobic
in nature. Thus, it can be inferred that the hydrophobic core is masked
when the candidate protein is in interaction with the two ligands.

Figure 9 (A) Probable
binding pockets in lyz as predicted by the FT algorithm.
Green, blue, and fade pink meshes represent the potential binding
sites, which may control the internal dynamics of the protein. Panels
B and C represent binding pockets of toluidine blue O (shaded in violet
mesh) and methylene blue (shaded in green mesh), respectively, in
lyz as obtained as the docking output. Panels D and E depict the nearest
binding sites of TBO and MB in lyz, respectively.

In the case of TBO, the residues within 2 Å of the ligand
are Trp 108, Trp 62, Trp 63, Val 109, Asn 59, and Asp 48. These are
those residues which have an immediate interaction with the ligand
when the ligand approaches the cleft of the receptor protein. The
protScale output plot shows a hydrophobic propensity from residue
110 to 115 (Figure S5). These are those
residues which remain at a distance greater than 2 Å but not
more than 5 Å. The residues within 5 Å distance from the
ligand are 35, 44, 47, 48, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 101, 102,
103, 110, 112, 113, and 114, among which residues 44, 47, 48, and
101 are hydrophilic in nature. This reflects that TBO has a significantly
higher propensity to bind to hydrophobic residues as only four out
of 19 residues are hydrophilic. On the other hand, when MB binds to
lyz, residues Trp 62, Trp 63, Val 109, and Arg 112 happen to be those
residues lying with 2 Å distance from the bound ligand. Furthermore,
the residues within 5 Å from MB are 34, 35, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50,
52, 56, 57, 75, 108, and 110. Residues 44, 45, 47, 48, and 50 are
hydrophilic in nature.

According to our docking experiments,
lyz–TBO and lyz–MB
associations correspond to the change in free energy −6.93
and −6.58 kcal mol–1, respectively. Using
these values, for both the acceptors, we have calculated the binding
constants, shown in Table 3, which almost merge with the experimental values. Here, we
used the following equation 11  where
ΔG is the change
in the Gibbs energy, T refers to the temperature
in kelvin (K), and KD represents the binding
constant of the ligand with the protein.

Inhibitory Effect on Lyz Fibrillogenesis
Monitored by ThT and
CR Assay
At low pH and high temperatures, amyloid fibrillogenesis
of lyz occurred. The parameters such as temperature, ionic strength,
and concentration of lyz effect the lag time of fibril formation.13,19,62,63 In this article, the inhibition of fibrillogenesis was examined
by the presence of TBO and MB with lyz. For this reason, lyz was dissolved
(10 mg/mL) in glycine–HCl buffer of pH ∼2.20 and heated
at 333.15 K with continuous stirring in the presence and absence of
40 μM TBO and 60 μM MB. To observe the formation and growth
of amyloid fibrils, ThT fluorescence and CR absorption spectroscopy
experiments were performed.

ThT fluorescence spectroscopy is
based on the notable feature of this dye as it forms highly fluorescent
complexes with amyloid and amyloid-like fibrils.64,65 ThT does not interact with globular proteins in a native state.
It also does not interact with molten globules and unfolded states
or amorphous aggregates of proteins. Therefore, the spectral property
of ThT depends on the fibril formation. It is believed that a notable
enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield or fluorescence intensity
was observed when the dye is incorporated into the highly ordered
linear array of the β-sheet structure of amyloid fibrils. Therefore,
ThT shows a sudden spectral enhancement when it binds with fibrils,
and this phenomenon can be used to monitor the fibrillogenesis kinetics.66,67

The ThT fluorescence intensity at 485 nm for the lyz sample
increased
sharply by attaining an equilibration plateau (Figure 10A). To examine the inhibitory effect of
TBO/MB on fibrillogenesis, the ThT fluorescence intensities of lyz
samples in the presence and absence of the dyes were compared. Figure 10A represents the
sigmoidal curve of the varying ThT fluorescence intensities as a function
of time. Each curve represented a lag phase (no significant change
in fluorescence intensity) followed by a growth phase (sudden notable
increment in fluorescence) and finally, the saturation phase where
ThT fluorescence reaches a plateau. From Figure 10A, it was observed that there is a notable
delay in fluorescence increment from 7 to 8 h for TBO and 6 to 7 h
for MB, suggesting that both dyes effectively delayed the growth of
amyloid fibrils. However, the influence of TBO is more in inhibiting
the fibrilogenesis. For lyz the lag phase was observed until 5 h,
whereas for lyz samples in the presence of TBO and MB, the lag phase
lasted till 7 and 6 h, respectively. This lag phase was accompanied
by a growth phase in the range 5–6, 7–8, and 6–7
h for lyz and lyz coincubated with TBO and MB. The growth phase was
followed by an equilibration plateau in all the cases. Hence, from
the detailed results, it can be concluded that coincubation of lyz
with TBO (40 μM) and MB (60 μM) resulted in the reduction
of ThT fluorescence, suggesting both the dyes had an inhibitory effect
on fibrillogenesis. The percentage of ThT fluorescence reductions
at 9 h incubation were calculated using the following equation 12  where, Io and I denote the ThT fluorescence
of lyz fibrils in the absence
and presence of TBO/MB. TBO and MB reduced the ThT fluorescence of
mature fibrils by 80 and 76%, respectively, at 9 h incubation.

Figure 10 Variation
of (A) fluorescence intensity of ThT at 485 nm and (B)
absorbance of CR at respective absorption maxima at different time
intervals for lyz samples (■) in the absence and presence of
TBO (●) and MB (▲).

The CR binding assay is a complementary path to identify
the amyloid
fibril formation in lyz protein. Amyloid fibrils showed apple-green
birefringence in cross-polarized light when it was stained with CR.12,68,69 Moreover, a significant reduction
in the absorption spectra along with a bathochromic shift at the maximum
of CR to ∼540 nm was observed, when lyz fibrils binds with
CR. The variations in CR absorption spectra (at respective absorption
maxima) for lyz in the absence and presence of TBO and MB at different
time intervals were plotted in Figure 10B. From the plot, it is was noticed that
there is a significant increment in the absorption of lyz samples
stained with CR along with a concomitant red shift in the absorption
maxima. This observation suggested the presence of an ordered fibrillar
structure of β strands in the lyz protein. Binding with TBO
and MB, there was a decrease in absorption maxima, which revealed
the inhibition in the formation of amyloid fibrils associated with
the cross-β-pleated sheet. These dyes also delayed the time
of fibril formation in lyz (Figure 9). Therefore, the ThT fluorescence and CR absorbance
technique unequivocally elucidate that both the dyes have a concentration-dependent
mitigating effect on the aggregation/fibril formation of lyz.

Conformational
Changes in Lyz in the Presence of TBO/MB
To monitor the effect
of TBO/MB on the changes of secondary structures
associated with the fibril formation in lyz, the far-UV CD spectra
were obtained. Initially, the CD spectra of lyz without and with TBO/MB
showed minima at 209 and 222 nm, which are the characteristics of
the α-helix structure (Figure 11). However, upon prolonged heating and continuous stirring,
the far-UV CD spectrum of lyz exhibited a noticeable structural transition
of α-helix to a highly amyloidogenic β-sheet-rich conformation.
The conformational transition was arrested by a characterized minimum
at 218 nm. The conformational transition in lyz arose at 6 h (Figure 11A), but in the
presence of TBO and MB, the structural transformations were delayed
at around 7.3 h (Figure 11B) and 6.5 h (Figure 11C), respectively. From the figures, it can be seen that in
the presence of TBO, the α-helix conformation was intact even
at 7 h of incubation, but in the presence of MB, the incubation was
at 6 h. Therefore, the outcome of the observation revealed that the
TBO delayed the α-to-β transition of lyz more potently
than MB.

Figure 11 Far-UV CD spectra of (A) lyz at 1 (curve 1), 6 (curve 2), 7 (curve
3), and 8 (curve 4) h of incubation. Panels B and C denote far-UV
CD changes of lyz in the presence of 40 μM of TBO and 60 μM
of MB, respectively, at 1 (curve 1), 6 (curve 2), 7 (curve 3), and
8 (curve 4) h of incubation.

With the binding of phenothiazinium dyes, the minima of CD
spectra
varied in the region of 216–220 nm, depending upon the incubation
time, nature, and concentration of the dyes used (Figure 11).

AFM Imaging of Fibrils
AFM imaging was performed to
investigate and gather further insights into the inhibitory effect
of the dyes on fibrillogenesis. AFM imaging suggested morphological
changes of lyz in the absence and presence of dyes at different incubation
time intervals. Figure 12A shows a bunch of matured and dense fibrils at 9 h of incubation
in lyz, but in the presence of TBO (Figure 12B) and MB (Figure 12C), the fibrils were found to be less-populated,
broken, and shorter in length and height.

Figure 12 AFM images of lyz in
the absence (A) and in the presence of TBO
(B) and MB (C) after 9 h of incubation.

Thus, AFM imaging unequivocally concluded that TBO and MB
inhibits
the amyloid fibril formation effectively.

Conclusions
The
binding interactions of TBO and MB to the protein lyz were
studied by experimental and theoretical biophysical approaches under
physiological conditions. Spectroscopic, calorimetric, as well as
molecular docking suggested that TBO possesses higher binding affinity
toward lyz than MB. Both dyes induced microenvironmental changes of
lyz, but the induced alteration was found more in Trp moieties than
in Tyr. On the other hand, the intrinsic fluorescence experiment suggested
the static quenching in lyz–TBO/MB-binding interactions, and
the phenomena were legitimated by the result of lifetime measurements.
Both the dyes induced strong secondary structural changes by the loss
of α-helix stability. From the ITC experiment, the binding constant
was found in the order of 105 M–1 in
both the cases, but the higher binding of TBO may be due to the large
hydrophobic contributions and H-bonding, which were also observed
from the molecular docking study. Moreover, TBO inhibited lyz fibrillogenesis
at 40 μM concentration, and for MB, it was 60 μM. Also,
TBO delayed the lyz fibril formation in large time-scale than MB.
From the study, we can conclude that both dyes strongly bind with
lyz and have inhibitory effects on amyloid fibrillogenesis; moreover,
TBO showed higher binding affinity as well as greater inhibition on
lyz aggregation than MB. Therefore, the current study provides an
insight into the antiamyloidogenic role of phenothiazinium dyes and
also shed light on the rational design of novel antiamyloidogenic
therapeutics.

Materials
MB (>95% pure, Riedel-de
Haën, GmBH, Germany) was bought
from Sigma-Aldrich GmBH. Hen egg white lyz (purity ≥98%, M = 14.3 kDa) and TBO (CAS no. 92-31-9, purity 80%) was
bought from Sigma-Aldrich. The commercial sample of lyz was purified
as previously reported.70 The sample was
then desalted on a Sephadex G-50 column, dialyzed in the cold (Spectra/Por
MWCO, 3500 membrane), and freeze-dried. Na-phosphate buffer (10 mM
Na+, 5 mM Na2HPO4) of pH 7.2 was
used to carry out all the studies. Sartorius (GmBH, Germany) PB-11
high-precision pH meter was used to measure the pH of buffer solutions.
Buffer solutions were filtered with the help of Millipore filters
(Millipore Bangalore) of 0.22 mm. TBO was purified by column chromatography
on neutral alumina using ethanol/benzene (7:3 v/v) containing 0.4%
glacial acetic acid. The fractions were pooled, concentrated under
vacuum, and crystallized. The crystals were dried in a vacuum desiccator
at room temperature to give spectrally pure dye.71 The purity of the MB solution was checked by measuring
the ratio of the absorbance at 665 nm to that at 610 nm, which was
always greater than 2.1, indicating the absence of any demethylated
dye in the sample.72 The concentration
of lyz, TBO, and MB was calculated by measuring the absorbance using
a molar absorption coefficient (ε) values of 37 750 M–1 cm–1 (280 nm),33−35 30 000
M–1 cm–1 (633 nm),52 and 76 000 M–1 cm–1 (664 nm),72 respectively.
The dyes obeyed Beers’ law in the concentration range used
in the experiment. Stock solutions of the dyes used in this study
are freshly prepared and placed in the dark to protect from photochemical
changes.

Methods
Steady-State Spectroscopic Study and Lifetime
Measurements
A JASCO V660 spectrophotometer (Hachioji, Japan)
was used to carry
out the absorption study, and the instrument was attached with a thermo
electrical controlling cell holder. The experiments were conducted
in quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Germany) of 1 cm path length at (293 ±
0.5) K. The titration procedures are described in detail previously.33−35

Steady-state fluorescence titrations were conducted either
in PTI QM-400 (HORIBA Canada) or using a RF5301-PC spectrofluorimeter
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in fluorescence-free quartz cuvette (1 cm)
as described.33−35,52 All titrations were
executed setting excitation and emission band passes of 5 and 5 nm,
respectively. For synchronous fluorescence, the excitation range was
220–340 nm and Δλ was set at 15 and 60 nm, respectively.

Lifetime measurements were performed using PTI QM-400 instrument.

Circular Dichroism Study
The JASCO spectropolarimeter
J-815 equipped with a temperature controller was used to perform the
CD experiments. The experiment was directed by the thermal programmer
(425L/15) of JASCO software at 293.15 ± 0.5 K.33−35,52,73 The CD spectra were
recorded at a scan speed of 50 nm min–1 along with
a step size of 0.5 nm. The sensitivity of the CD was 10 millidegree,
and the bandwidth was 0.2 nm. To modify the signal to noise ratio,
about 15 accumulations were carried out, and the spectra were smoothed
within permissible limits.

Moreover, far UV spectra of lyz fibrils
in the absence and presence of dyes were also recorded in the 190–250
nm region to monitor the conformational changes. For this purpose,
100 μL of the sample solution was diluted with 200 μL
of glycine–HCl buffer, and then the CD spectra were recorded
at different time intervals using a 0.1 cm path length cuvette.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Isothermal titration
calorimetry measurements were carried out on a VP-ITC MicroCal (MicroCal)
instrument at 293.15 K. The revolving syringe was loaded with lyz
solutions, and 10 μL of lyz was injected each time into the
cell containing dye solutions. The syringe rotation was set to be
at the speed of 307 rpm, and the spacing of the injections was 240
s. Control experiments were executed in which lyz solutions were titrated
into the buffer solutions under the same conditions. These reference
heats of dilution were subtracted from the corresponding dye–lyz
complex reactions to obtain the exact heat of the binding processes.
The heat of the reaction of dye–lyz binding was evaluated by
integrating the area under each heat burst curve.33−35 The ITC data
were analyzed by Microsoft Origin software and fitted with “one
site binding model” to get the standard thermodynamics parameters.
Binding constant (K), binding stoichiometry (N), standard molar enthalpy change (ΔH°), standard Gibbs energy for the complex formation (ΔG°), and the changes of entropy (TΔS°) were derived from standard relationships,
ΔG° = −RT ln K (R = 1.9872 cal/mol K, T = 298.15 K) and ΔG° = ΔH° – TΔS°. Temperature-dependent
ITC were conducted by varying the temperature, and it gave the information
about the standard molar heat capacity changes (ΔCp°). The
calorimeter was calibrated with water–water dilutions as described
by the manufacturer so that the mean energy <1.30 μcal for
each injection, and the standard deviation was <0.015 μcal.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
The residual heat
capacities of the protein and its dye complexes were estimated from
the DSC study. It may also be used to measure thermal melting transition
temperatures for the compounds. The experiment was performed on a
MicroCal LLC, VPDSC unit, USA (now Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK).
By repeating the buffer scanning, the instrument was settled thermally
stable with a scanning rate of 333.15 K per hour and at 25 psi pressure.
The baseline was deducted from the complex thermograms. The DSC profiles
were scanned by Origin 7.0 software to provide the model independent
calorimetric transition enthalpy (ΔHcal).52,53

Molecular Docking
With an objective
to have a mechanistic
insight into the protein—ligand association we resorted to
theoretical approaches. We went on to have the docking output by resorting
to molecular docking. The co-ordinate information of lyz was retrieved
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (PDB ID: 1DPX). The energy structure of the candidate
ligand molecules (toluidine blue O and methylene blue) was minimized
using the Avogadro 1.1.1 molecular editor, and the MOL2 format was
used as the ligand input for docking analysis. The predock processing
of the lyz co-ordinate file which was involved in the removal of water
molecules and all bound ligand molecules was executed using the Dock
Prep plugin of UCSF Chimera molecular viewer. Protein–ligand
docking was performed with SwissDock, which relies on the back-end
software EADock DSS in the CHARMM force field. The lowest binding
energy was chosen from among the most possible 10 top order docking
conformations. The result was analyzed by DockView plugin of UCSF
Chimera.

Binding-Site Dynamics
The virtual study involving the
FT algorithm was resorted to predict the probable binding sites of
lyz. The study was pertinent as it could help unveil the mechanistic
mode by which TBO and MB can dock them over the lyz-binding cleft.
The solvent-mapping algorithm in FTSite is actually a direct computational
analog of these screening techniques. In this approach, a computational
mapping is implemented that actually controls the individual placement
of each of the 16 disparate small molecular probes over a dense grid
around the protein. It in turn finds the favorable positions employing
empirical free energy functions. For each probe type, the individual
probes are then clustered and the clusters are also ranked on the
average free energy. Then, consensus clusters are recognized as sites
in which different probe clusters overlap. Depending upon the total
number of nonbonded interactions present between the protein and all
probes in the cluster, the consensus clusters are ranked. Here, the
consensus cluster in which the highest number of contacts is present
is ranked first, also nearby consensus clusters are joined with this
cluster. The top ranked predicted ligand binding site comprises those
amino acid residues that are in contact with the probes of the newly
defined cluster. Clusters with fewer contacts represent lower ranked
predictions.

Lyz Fibrils Formation
In glycin–HCl
buffer lyz
samples (10 mg/1 mL) were dissolved at pH ∼2.20, containing
100 mM Na-chloride and 1.54 mM NaN3.12 For preparation of amyloid fibrils, 2 mL of lyz stock solution
was transferred to a 25 mL glass tube, diluted to 20 mL by glycine–HCl
buffer, and then stirred with polytetrafluoroethylene-coated microstirring
bars at 220 rpm and at 333.15 K temperature.12,74,75 The glass tubes are vortexed gently to homogenize
the samples at a required time gap, and then 1 mL aliquots of the
sample were taken for the following experiments.

ThT Fluorescence
Experiments
ThT fluorescence experiments
were conducted on a Shimadzu spectrofluorimeter (RF-5301 PC). ThT
stock solution was prepared, and its concentration was measured by
the procedure reported in the literature.12,76 For this purpose, 150 μL of lyz aliquots in the absence and
presence of TBO/MB were diluted with 760 μL of buffer at desired
time intervals. Then, an appropriate amount of ThT was mixed to the
solution to make the total ThT concentration to 20 μM. Fluorescence
intensities at 485 nm were recorded in slow-speed by exciting the
resultant mixtures at 416 nm.

CR Binding Assay
The CR binding experiment was performed
to detect the fibril formation in lyz in the absence and presence
of dyes. For this purpose, CR was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
to prepare 1 mM concentrated solution. 50 μL of lyz solutions
were diluted with 1 mL of buffer solutions followed by the addition
of CR solution so that the final concentration of CR in the total
solution was 10 μM. Then, the solution mixtures were incubated
at room temperature for 30 min. The absorption spectra of lyz in the
absence and presence of TBO/MB were recorded in the 400–800
nm region. The absorbance value at corresponding absorption maxima
of the dyes were recorded and plotted against the corresponding time
intervals.

AFM Imaging
For the AFM imaging
study, the solutions
of lyz fibrils were diluted to 100-fold with water. Then, around 5
μL of this sample solution was adsorbed onto a freshly cleaved
muscovite ruby mica sheet (ASTM VI grade Ruby Mica from Micafab, Chennai,
India). Thereafter, the mica sheet was dried for 30 min in vacuum
in an inert atmosphere. The complexes were incubated for 15 min prior
to adsorption onto the mica sheet. AFM was performed in the AAC mode
on PicoPlus 5500 ILM AFM (Agilent Technologies, USA), which was attached
with a piezo-scanner of a maximum range of 9 μm. Here, microfabricated
silicon cantilevers of NANOSENSORS (USA) were used. The resonance
frequency of the cantilever oscillation was 146–236 kHz, whereas
the force constant was 21–98 N/m. The rate of the scan speed
was 0.5 lines/s while taking the images (256 by 256 pixels). All the
images were processed by flattening using PicoView software (Agilent
Technologies, 1.1 version), whereas their manipulation was conducted
by Pico Image Advanced version software.
