Pt
nanoparticles were loaded on Y2WO6:Eu3+ phosphor microspheres to enhance hydrogen sensitivity at
low temperatures through turn-off luminescence. Mesoporous Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres were synthesized first
by a hydrothermal method. Pt loading on the surface of the Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres was then carried out
by a method of the self-regulated reduction of surfactants using aqueous
K2PtCl4 solutions. Structural and morphological
properties of unloaded and Pt-loaded Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres were investigated by various techniques such
as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The relative photoluminescence
intensity of the Pt-loaded Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres, due to 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3,
4) electronic transitions of doped Eu3+ ions, was found
to decrease as low as 22% after the microspheres were kept in the
hydrogen gas atmosphere at a low temperature of 150 °C for 15
min. Meanwhile, mechanisms underlying this turn-off luminescence of
the Pt/Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres in
response to hydrogen gas are illustrated in detail.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen
fuels are a clean and sustainable energy source, which
have been expected to replace the fossil energy source in future.
However, hydrogen is an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas and
has a wide explosion concentration range.1 In order to solve safety issues of hydrogen gas, the gas sensor
is very important. In recent years, various types of hydrogen gas
sensors have been developed, such as a semiconductor type,2 an electrochemical type,3 and an optical type.4

The semiconductor-type
sensors measure changes of electrical resistance
upon exposure to reducing gases. Both the detection limit and the
response time can be tuned by selecting the kinds of metal oxide semiconductors
(SnO2, ZnO, WO3, Ga2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, etc.) and catalytic
metals (Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, etc.).5 The operation
of the semiconductor-type sensors generally needs high temperatures,
typically between 180 and 450 °C, to promote the reaction with
reducing gases.1 For detecting hydrogen
gas, however, the high temperatures are not desirable because they
can possibly trigger off the explosion.5 The electrochemical-type sensors use proton-conducting electrolytes
or hydrogen-sensitive electrodes. The operation temperature of the
electrochemical-type sensors depends on the kinds of electrolytes:
as low as room temperature for liquid electrolytes and as high as
1000 °C for solid electrolytes. Both the lower and the upper
limits of the hydrogen detection are also determined by the structures
and materials used for the electrochemical-type sensors.3 The optical-type sensors are based on fibers
or thin films coated with materials, which undergo drastic changes
of their structures or optical properties by reacting with hydrogen.1 Compared to the other two types, the optical-type
sensors have much less variety in materials of practical use. However,
the optical-type sensors utilize light as a raw signal and work stably
at low temperatures even under explosive dangerous environment.6−8 The optical-type sensors are therefore still being explored because
of their inherently safe detection.1

Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is one of the promising optical
sensing materials because of its high reactivity with hydrogen.6,8 Metal tungstates doped with trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) have been demonstrated to show excellent luminescence properties
for applications in various fields.9−11 However, there have
been few reports on luminescent tungstates employed for optically
detecting or sensing hydrogen gas so far. We have recently reported
turn-off luminescence (quenching) of CaWO4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ and Tb3+) phosphor
particles treated at 600 °C in the regulated 4%H2/96%N2 atmosphere.12 The quenching of
the Ln3+ emissions was associated with the nonradiative
decay because of the increased oxygen vacancies following a change
of the W6+/W5+ redox states in the CaWO4 host. A problem of using CaWO4:Ln3+ is that the substitution of Ln3+ for Ca2+ is
inevitably accompanied by lattice defects in CaWO4, leading
to lower luminescence intensity. Furthermore, it is not easy to monitor
the reduction-induced turn-off luminescence during heating at 600
°C because of the occurrence of temperature quenching. To overcome
these disadvantages, it is necessary to design a highly luminescent
tungstate material which is responsive to hydrogen gas at lower temperatures.

Y2WO6 is one of the important types of the
tungstates because it has been attracting attention widely because
of its self-activating luminescence properties and high chemical and
thermal stability.13,14 An Eu3+-doped Y2WO6 (denoted as YWE, hereafter) phosphor exhibits
red luminescence under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation because of the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions. It has been
proven to exhibit interesting luminescence properties with potential
applications in various fields. For example, Llanos et al.15 fabricated a YWE/TiO2 composite photoelectrode
for the use in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Because the luminescent
YWE could convert UV radiation from the sun to the visible radiation,
the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSC was higher than
that using pure TiO2. Chen et al.16 fabricated a composite bulk where carbon dots/YWE was embedded in
a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix for a color-tunable luminescent
material.

Here, we attempted to use YWE as a hydrogen gas sensing
material.
The Eu3+ ions would partly occupy the crystallographic
sites of Y3+ in Y2WO6, and better
luminescence properties than those of undoped Y2WO6 would be expected. In our study, first, the YWE phosphor
was fabricated as mesoporous microspheres by a hydrothermal method.
After that, because the platinum (Pt) catalyst is considered to improve
the sensing characteristics for hydrogen gas, Pt-loaded YWE microspheres
were synthesized by a method of the self-regulated reduction of the
surfactant.17 In this method, we used a
surfactant of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the reductant and the
protective agent for precipitating the Pt metal on the surface of
the YWE microspheres in aqueous K2PtCl4 solutions.
Finally, turn-off luminescence properties of the unloaded and the
Pt-loaded YWE microspheres were examined, and their low-temperature
response was compared in the H2/N2 atmosphere.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Microspheres
The structure of pristine and Pt-loaded YWE microspheres was examined
first. A sample having the largest amount of Pt nanoparticles (YWE-P20;
see the Experimental Section for designation)
was chosen for analyzing the Pt-loading state on the YWE microspheres.
The crystalline phase of the pristine YWE and the YWE-P20 microspheres
was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). From Figure 1, both the microspheres exhibit
a pattern that can be indexed to the tetragonal Y2WO6 structure,18 and no other oxide
phase is detected. The tetragonal structure of Y2WO6 is a metastable phase below 800 °C. It is related to
the ABO4 scheelite-type crystal structure where the A site
is occupied with Y3+ and the B site is occupied statistically
by a mixture of (1/3)Y3+ and (2/3)W6+.18 This structure appeared in the present study
because the YWE microspheres were obtained by finally heating at 750
°C. Diffraction peaks of Pt nanoparticles are not seen in the
pattern of YWE-P20, mainly because of an extremely small size of the
nanoparticles dispersing well on the surface of the respective YWE
crystallites.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the pristine YWE and the Pt-loaded YWE-P20
microspheres.

From a field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image
of the pristine YWE microspheres (Figure 2a), the spherical particles with a size up
to 10 μm are observed, and their surface appears to be relatively
smooth. In contrast, YWE-P20 exhibits the rough surface, although
the particle size is almost unchanged (Figure 2b). This indicates that Pt nanoparticles
could be loaded on the surface of the YWE microspheres.

Figure 2 (a,b) FE-SEM
and (c–e) FE-TEM images of the (a,c) pristine
YWE and (b,d,e) Pt-loaded YWE-P20 microspheres together with a (f)
corresponding FFT pattern for Pt.

An FE transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) image (Figure 2c) reveals that a
size of primary particles, which aggregate to form the large secondary
spherical particles, is approximately 50–60 nm in the pristine
YWE microspheres. An adsorption–desorption isotherm plot for
the nitrogen sorption (77 K) of the pristine YWE microspheres is shown
in Figure S1a (Supporting Information).
The shape of the plot corresponds to the “type IV” isotherm
in the Brunauer classification.19 An observed
hysteresis loop is associated with the filling and emptying of mesopores
by capillary condensation. Actually, the pristine YWE microspheres
have a peak of around 40 nm in the pore size distribution, as shown
in Figure S1b. The hysteresis loop of the
isotherm is classified as “type H1”, which is attributed
to pores within aggregates of uniformly sized spherical particles.19 The pristine YWE microspheres also possess macropores
because the plot rises rapidly at higher relative pressures. A Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area of the pristine YWE microspheres was determined
to be 18.6 m2 g–1.

The surface
of the primary particles of the pristine YWE microspheres
is free from any precipitates. On the other hand, an FE-TEM image
(Figure 2d) of the
YWE-P20 microspheres shows clearly that nanoparticles are attached
uniformly to the surface of their primary particles. A high-resolution
image of the nanoparticle (Figure 2e) and a corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT)
pattern (Figure 2f)
confirm that it is Pt metal. The mean size of the Pt nanoparticles
is approximately 2.9 nm. The FE-TEM images and the size distribution
of the Pt nanoparticles of YWE-Px (x = 5, 10, 15, or 20 as a reacting volume of a 0.01 mol L–1 aq K2PtCl4 solution in mL) samples indicate
that both the diameter and the amount of the Pt nanoparticles increase
as the reacting volume is increased during the Pt-loading procedure
(Figure S2). This suggests that the larger
amount of the Pt2+ ions in the solution leads to the more
frequent heterogeneous nucleation and growth of the Pt nanoparticles.

A result of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis
of a P20 sample (Figure 3a), which was obtained from a simple mixed SDS and K2PtCl4 solution (20 mL), confirms the appearance of peaks at 2.05,
9.44, and 11.1 keV corresponding to X-ray energies of Pt Mα1, Pt Lα1, and Pt Lβ1, respectively.20 Thus, the method of the self-regulated reduction
of surfactants is useful to precipitate the Pt metal. In an EDS spectrum
of the YWE-P20 microspheres, the similar peaks are observed because
of the Pt nanoparticles attached on their surface (Figure 3b). A high-angle annular dark-field
scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image of the YWE-P20 microspheres is shown
in Figure 3c, together
with elemental mappings for Pt, Y, and W. They clearly indicate that
Pt is present on the surface of the YWE particles.

Figure 3 EDS spectra of the (a)
P20 sample and (b) YWE-P20 microspheres
and an (c) HAADF-STEM image of the YWE-P20 microspheres together with
corresponding elemental mappings.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to
examine further the Pt nanoparticles loaded on the surface of the
YWE microspheres. In Figure 4a, there appear no peaks related to Pt metals in a Pt 4f region
for the pristine YWE microspheres. On the other hand, a spectrum of
the YWE-P20 microspheres (Figure 4b) contains two peaks of Pt(4f5/2) and Pt(4f7/2) at 74.58 and 71.51 eV, respectively. These peaks are consistent
with those of metallic Pt (Pt0) attached on the surface
of metal oxides.21 It can be judged from
the above FE-TEM, EDS, and XPS results that the metallic Pt nanoparticles
could be loaded on the surface of the YWE microspheres successfully.

in the Pt 4f region.

2.2 Luminescence
Properties of Microspheres
A YWE-P0.5 sample was chosen for
examining luminescence properties
and H2 response of the Pt-loaded YWE microspheres because
it had a minimum influence of the Pt loading not only on initial photoluminescence
(PL) intensity before the H2 gas treatment, as described
below, but also on the surface microstructure. As shown in Figure S1c,d, the YWE-P0.5 sample has the nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution
similar to those of the pristine YWE microspheres. The BET specific
surface area of the YWE-P0.5 sample was 22.2 m2 g–1.

Figure 5 shows
PL excitation and emission spectra of the pristine YWE and the Pt-loaded
YWE-P0.5 microspheres. The excitation spectra were monitored at an
emission wavelength of 612 nm. For both the microspheres, a broad
and intense band peaking at about 300 nm is observed because of overlapping
O2––Eu3+ and O2––W6+ charge-transfer transitions in the Eu3+-doped Y2WO6 crystal. There also appear
weak f–f transitions of Eu3+ at about 382 (7F0 → 5G3), 394 (7F0 → 5L6), and 414
nm (7F0 → 5D3).
The PL emission spectra show line emissions because of transitions
from the excited 5D0 state to the ground 7FJ states (J =
0, 1, 2, 3, 4) for the 4f6 configuration of Eu3+ under the 302 nm excitation. The forced electric dipole transition
of 5D0 → 7F2 around
612 nm is observed prominently in the Y2WO6 host
crystal.22

Figure 5 PL excitation (an emission wavelength,
λem, of
612 nm) and emission (an excitation wavelength, λex, of 302 nm) spectra of the pristine YWE and the Pt-loaded YWE-P0.5
microspheres.

Next, the effects of the Pt loading
on the PL intensity of the
YWE microspheres were examined in detail. PL excitation and emission
spectra of the pristine YWE and the Pt-loaded YWE-Px microspheres are shown in Figure S3.
Apparently, the intensity is decreased with the increasing x value. The relative PL intensity was then determined quantitatively
by integrating spectral peaks for the Eu3+ emissions in
the range between 400 and 750 nm for all the samples; the intensity
of the pristine YWE microspheres was normalized to 100% and that of
the YWE-Px samples was calculated as the percentage. Figure 6 shows the relationship
between the reacting volume (x mL) of the K2PtCl4 solution and the relative PL intensity of the respective
YWE-Px microspheres. A rapid decrease in the PL intensity
is observed with the reacting volume up to 2 mL. The intensity is
then gradually decreased to 1% with the volume of 15 mL or more. This
result is explained by the increasing amount of the Pt nanoparticles
deposited on the surface of the YWE microspheres. That is, the presence
of the Pt nanoparticles disturbs both the incident of the excitation
light and the extraction of the emitted light for the microspheres.
The other Pt-loading conditions, namely, reflux temperature and time
of the K2PtCl4 solution, were also examined,
and an optimal condition was found to be 100 °C and 2 h (Figure S4), respectively, as described in the Experimental Section. Accordingly, the YWE-P0.5
sample, which maintained the sufficient PL intensity (83% of the pristine
YWE sample), was chosen for further experiments including the H2 gas treatment.

Figure 6 Relative PL intensity (λex =
302 nm), integrated
between 400 and 750 nm for the Eu3+ emissions, of the YWE-Px microspheres. The reaction for the Pt loading was carried
out at 100 °C for 2 h under reflux for all the samples.

2.3 H2 Gas Response
of Microspheres
The YWE-P0.5 microspheres were exposed to
the 4%H2/96%N2 atmosphere with a flowing rate
of 0.1–0.2 L min–1 at a temperature range
between 100 and 300 °C
for 15 min. PL excitation and emission spectra of the YWE-P0.5 microspheres
after the H2 gas treatment at the respective temperatures
are shown in Figure S5a, and the relative
PL intensity is plotted against the temperature in Figure 7a. Note that the relative PL
intensity (integrated between 400 and 750 nm with the excitation at
302 nm) for the YWE-P0.5 microspheres before the treatment was normalized
to 100% and that of the treated samples was calculated as the percentage.
The H2 gas treatment at 100 °C leads to a decrease
in the PL intensity to 64%. A further decrease to 22% is observed
at 150 °C. The extent of decrease is then lowered to 13% at the
higher temperatures up to 300 °C. Figure 7b shows the dependence of the relative PL
intensity on the H2 gas treatment time (5, 10, or 15 min)
at 150 °C (see Figure S5b for PL excitation
and emission spectra). It is observed that the intensity decreases
to 45% after 5 min, indicating that the YWE-P0.5 microspheres are
highly responsive to H2 at the low temperature. The intensity
is then decreased with the increasing treatment time.

Figure 7 Relative PL intensity
(λex = 302 nm), integrated
between 400 and 750 nm for the Eu3+ emissions, of the YWE-P0.5
microspheres with the H2 gas treatment (a) at temperatures
between 100 and 300 °C for 15 min and (b) at 150 °C for
5, 10, or 15 min. The percentage of the relative PL intensity is indicated
in parentheses.

It is supposed that the reason
for turn-off luminescence observed
for the present Pt/Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres
upon the H2 gas treatment is associated with the lattice
defects formed in the Y2WO6 host crystal. In
our former study, CaWO4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ or Tb3+) phosphor particles underwent
the PL quenching of the doped Ln3+ ions when they were
heat-treated at 600 °C for 10 min in the 4%H2/96%N2 atmosphere.12 Note that CaWO4 has the scheelite-type crystal structure similar to the present
tetragonal Y2WO6 as explained for Figure 1. Among the possibilities of
the Ln3+ valence change, the partial W6+/W5+ valence change, or the formation of oxygen vacancies, the
PL quenching was assumed to be related to the nonradiative decay because
of the increased amount of oxygen vacancies. In that case, the absorption
of the visible light of CaWO4 was enhanced by generating
defect levels within the band gap. Figure 8 then compares diffuse reflectance spectra
of the present YWE-P0.5 microspheres before and after the H2 gas treatment at 150 °C for 5, 10, or 15 min. The reflectance
decreases monotonically at wavelengths longer than 360 nm with the
increasing treatment time. This decrease is attributed mainly to an
increase of the W6+–W5+ intervalence
charge-transfer (IVCT) absorption.23,24 Thus, the
partial reduction of W6+ to W5+ and the simultaneous
formation of oxygen vacancies are promoted by the H2 gas
treatment, as expressed below 1  

Figure 8 Diffuse reflectance
spectra of the YWE-P0.5 microspheres before
and after the H2 gas treatment at 150 °C for 5, 10,
or 15 min.

As a result, the PL emissions
of the Eu3+ ions are considerably
quenched. The reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ is much
less possibly because Eu3+ is located stably at the isovalent
Y3+ site. No emissions related to allowed 5d–4f
transitions of Eu2+ were observed in the present study.

Another important finding is that the Pt loading can largely enhance
the H2 gas response. Figure 9 compares the relative PL intensity of the pristine
YWE microspheres before and after the H2 gas treatment
under various conditions. The intensity is almost unchanged after
the heat treatment at 150 °C for 15 min, indicating that the
YWE microspheres do not react with H2 at such a low temperature.
This is in sharp contrast to the case of YWE-P0.5 also shown in Figure 9 for comparison.
The elevation of the treatment temperature can promote the decrease
of the PL intensity when the treatment time is simultaneously prolonged
to 2 h. Almost the same extent of the decrease is achieved for the
pristine YWE microspheres only after the H2 gas treatment
at 700 °C for 2 h. It should be mentioned here that the decreased
PL intensity can be recovered by heating the reduced YWE microspheres
at 700 °C for 2 h in air, which is regarded as turn-on luminescence.
The switchable turn-off/turn-on luminescence would be expected if
we could recover the PL intensity at much lower temperatures. In any
case, the mesoporous structure of the microspheres is of prime significance
for the gas responsivity as we confirmed that nonporous micrometer-sized
YWE particles synthesized by a solid-state reaction method did not
show turn-off luminescence after the same H2 treatment
(Figure S6).

Figure 9 Relative PL intensity
(λex = 302 nm), integrated
between 400 and 750 nm for the Eu3+ emissions, of the pristine
YWE microspheres with the H2 gas treatment at temperatures
between 150 and 700 °C for 15 min or 2 h. The data for the Pt-loaded
YWE-P0.5 microspheres are also shown for comparison. The percentage
of the relative PL intensity is indicated in parentheses.

We discuss the above enhancement based on the currently developed
Pt/WO3 hydrogen gas sensors, in which many models have
been proposed to explain the gasochromic color reaction of WO3.8,25,26 As depicted
in Figure 10, when
the YWE-P0.5 microspheres are put into the H2 gas atmosphere,
the H2 molecules will be dissociated into H atoms by the
Pt catalyst on the surface of the YWE microspheres. Subsequently,
H atoms lose electrons to form protons and enter the YWE lattice.
Then, W6+ ions are reduced to W5+ ions by electrons
in the YWE lattice. Protons can also generate oxygen vacancies through
the Pt-catalyzed reaction 1. As a result, the turn-off luminescence observed in YWE-P0.5 has
the complex mechanisms of the W6+–W5+ IVCT absorption and the nonradiative decay by oxygen vacancies caused
by the Pt-catalyzed reaction with H2. Such an interesting
phenomenon is expected to be a new technology of luminescence sensing
of hydrogen gas.

the Pt/Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres.

3 Conclusions
The
mesoporous Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres
were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The platinum nanoparticles
were homogeneously dispersed on the surface of the Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres successfully using a method
of self-regulated reduction of surfactants. The Pt/Y2WO6:Eu3+ (YWE-P0.5) microspheres exhibited a large
degree of turn-off luminescence in the H2 gas atmosphere
at a low temperature of 150 °C for a relatively short time of
15 min. The mechanisms of the H2-responsive turn-off luminescence
were supposed to be the W6+–W5+ IVCT
absorption and the nonradiative decay by oxygen vacancies caused by
the Pt-catalyzed reaction with H2. The Pt/Y2WO6:Eu3+ microspheres are then expected to
be applied to a novel optical hydrogen gas sensor.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Y2WO6:Eu3+ Microspheres
The Y2WO6:Eu3+ (YWE) microspheres were fabricated
by a hydrothermal method.
Y(NO3)3·6H2O (0.73 g, 99.9%
purity, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and 0.045 g of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (99.95%, Kanto Chemical)
were added into 8 mL of deionized water using nitric acid (1.38) at
pH 2.7 (Y/Eu = 0.95:0.05 in mol). H2WO4 (0.25
g, 99.9%, Wako) and 0.38 g of citric acid (98.0%, Wako) were dissolved
into 22 mL of a 0.4 mol L–1 aqueous NaOH solution.
The two resultant solutions were mixed at pH 3.1 and stirred for 30
min. The mixture solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined
stainless autoclave for the hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for
6.5 h. The as-prepared samples were collected and washed three times
with deionized water, dried in air at 60 °C for more than 12
h, and finally annealed at 750 °C for 2 h in air to obtain the
YWE microspheres.

For comparison, the YWE particles were also
synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Y2O3 (0.47 g, 99.99%, Wako), 0.039 g of Eu2O3 (99.9%, Wako), and 0.51 g of WO3 (99.9%, Soekawa
Chemical) were mixed and ball-milled for 2 h using 20 mL of ethanol
as a milling medium (Y/Eu/W = 1.9:0.1:1 in mol). The resultant mixture
was dried at 80 °C, heated to 1200 °C at a heating rate
of 5 °C min–1, kept there for 5 h, and cooled
naturally to room temperature to obtain the YWE sample.

4.2 Pt Loading on Y2WO6:Eu3+ Microspheres
The Pt-loaded YWE microspheres (YWE-Px) were fabricated
by the method of the self-regulated reduction
of surfactants. The YWE microsphere (0.461 g) was placed into 25 mL
of a 0.04 mol L–1 aqueous SDS solution. The resultant
solution was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h so that the microspheres
could be completely dispersed. Immediately after that, the SDS/YWE
solution was refluxed in an oil bath at 100 °C for 2 h to decompose
SDS into 1-dodecanol, whose process was expressed in the following
reaction 2(17) 2  

Subsequently, x mL
(x = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, or 20) of a 0.01
mol L–1 aqueous K2PtCl4 solution
was added dropwise into the SDS/YWE solution, which was refluxed at
100 °C for another 2 h. The Pt2+ ions were reduced
by 1-dodecanol to the Pt metal, as expressed by the following reaction 3, forming the Pt nanoparticles on the YWE microspheres 3  

Then, the reacted samples were filtered, washed three times with
deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The YWE-Px samples were obtained after annealing at 300 °C for
2 h to remove the residual SDS on the surface of the microspheres.

Separately, the precipitation behavior of the Pt metal from the
SDS and K2PtCl4 solution (20 mL) was examined
without adding the YWE microspheres. The Pt sample thus obtained was
designated simply as P20.

4.3 H2 Gas Treatment
The YWE
microspheres (0.05 or 0.10 g) were placed into the alumina boat to
reduce at 150, 300, 500, or 700 °C for 15 min or 2 h in the 4%H2/96%N2 atmosphere with a flowing rate of 0.1–0.2
L min–1. The YWE-P0.5 microspheres (0.05 g) underwent
the same H2-reducing treatment at 100, 150, 200, 250, or
300 °C for 5, 10, or 15 min.

4.4 Characterization
The crystalline
phase of the samples was identified by the XRD analysis using a Bruker
AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation (λ =
1.5418 Å). The morphology and microstructure of the samples were
observed by FE-SEM (Inspect F50, FEI), FE-TEM (Tecnai G2, FEI), and
STEM (Tecnai Osiris, FEI). EDS was also performed using FE-TEM and
STEM. The BET specific surface area and the pore size distribution
of the samples were determined from nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm at 77 K with a MicrotracBEL BELSORP-mini II analyzer. XPS
was performed on a JEOL JPS-9010TR spectrometer using Mg Kα
radiation for elemental analysis. The PL spectra were recorded on
a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a xenon lamp
(150 W) as a light source at room temperature. The diffuse reflectance
spectra of the samples were recorded on a JASCO V-670 UV–vis
spectrophotometer using a JASCO ISN-723 integrating sphere unit.
