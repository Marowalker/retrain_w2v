A three-dimensional
(3D) dysprosium(III) metal-organic framework
with nicotinate N-oxide (NNO–)
and squarate (C4O42–) mixed
bridging ligands, [Dy(NNO)(C4O4)(H2O)]n (1), has been hydrothermally
synthesized. The dysprosium(III) ions are linked to each other by
the squarate anions to form a unique dysprosium(III) squarate double-layered
network; the NNO– anions then bridge such layers
to complete the 3D framework. Complex 1 exhibits a two-step
relaxation of magnetization under a dc field of 1000 Oe, with effective
energy barrier values of 8.5 and 14.3 K, respectively.

Introduction
Recently, lanthanide(III)
ions have been widely used to design
and construct metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) not only due to their
higher coordination numbers with respect to those of transition metal
ions but also due to their unique 4f electrons, which may create structural
diversity and result in interesting optical and magnetic properties.1,2 First, photoluminescence is the main subject of a study of lanthanide
MOFs (LnMOFs); the interest stems from the fact that most lanthanide(III)
cations display characteristic narrow fluorescent emissions in virtue
of the ligands’ antenna effect.2 Further, single-molecule magnet (SMM) behaviors have also been observed
in some LnMOFs, especially Dy(III) MOFs quite recently, because most
lanthanide(III) ions have big magnetic moments and an obvious magnetic
anisotropy, which meet the two corresponding prerequisites for an
SMM.3,4 SMMs are characterized by slow magnetic
relaxation and magnetic bistability, making them potential molecular
materials in high-technique areas, such as quantum computing, high-density
information storage devices, and spintronics.5−7 Only limited
LnMOFs showing SMM behaviors have been explored,8−27 although a great advantage has been shown by 2D and 3D LnMOFs in
which the lanthanide(III) ions, each of which corresponds to a single-ion
magnet, are arranged as highly ordered “nanoscale-separation
dots”. This is very useful for molecular devices of density
information storage and quantum computer. Therefore, there is increasing
interest in exploring new LnMOF systems behaving as SMMs.

Organic
carboxylates, especially binary carboxylates, are often
adopted as organic linkers to assemble LnMOFs because they show rich
binding patterns and the oxygen atoms have a high affinity to the
lanthanide(III) cations. Notably, the second bridging ligand is extensively
used along with the main bridging ligand to construct LnMOFs; this
improved approach can increase the flexibility and diversity of assembly,
producing more LnMOFs with beautiful structures and interesting properties.
Notably, oxalate (C2O42–)
has been successfully utilized as the second bridging ligand to assemble
many novel LnMOFs.28−40 In contrast, LnMOFs with a noncarboxylic acid type of organic polyacid
as the second bridging ligand are documented rarely in the literature.
For example, the squarate anion, which can be considered as an analogue
of the oxalate anion (Scheme 1),41−43 is seldom chosen as the second bridging ligand to
construct LnMOFs. Nevertheless, both the carbonyl oxygen atom and
the hydroxyl oxygen atom can bind to lanthanide(III) ions easily,
which makes the squarate anion have rich coordination modes and show
excellent bridging ability. In this regard, we have used nicotinate N-oxide (NNO–) as the main bridging ligand
and squarate as the second bridging ligand to construct LnMOFs recently.
In this article, we report the preparation, X-ray crystal structure,
and properties of such a three-dimensional (3D) LnMOF, [Dy(NNO)(C4O4)(H2O)]n (1; C4O42– =
squarate). Complex 1 contains a unique dysprosium(III)
squarate double-layered network, showing an interesting 3D topological
structure. Notably, it exhibits a two-step magnetic relaxation under
a dc field of 1000 Oe.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and XRD Spectrum
Similar to the preparation
of LnMOFs with the second bridging ligand oxalate,28−40 the hydrothermal reaction technique was utilized to avoid yielding
the lanthanide(III) squarate precipitate directly, and the lanthanide(III)
starting materials may react with squaric acid and nicotinic acid N-oxide synchronously under hydrothermal conditions. Complex 1 was hydrothermally prepared by the reaction of squaric acid,
nicotinic acid N-oxide, Dy(NO3)3·5H2O, and 15 mL of H2O at 170 °C
for 5 days; only one crystalline phase was formed; the same product
was obtained if double the quantity of nicotinic acid N-oxide was utilized, but the yield became smaller. The purity of
the as-synthesized crystalline-phase product was examined by comparing
its XRD spectrum with the ideal patterns simulated from the single-crystal
structure (Figure S1); their peaks match
well with each other.

Crystal Structure
As shown in Figure 1, the 3D framework
of complex 1 comprises dysprosium(III) squarate double
layers and antiparallel
NNO– double bridging ligands, whereas water molecules
just act as terminal ligands binding to dysprosium(III) atoms. There
is only one crystallographic independent dysprosium(III) atom, which
adopts an eight-coordinated geometry, completed by four oxygen atoms
from four squarate anions, two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate group
of one NNO– anion, one oxygen atom from the N-oxide group of the neighboring antiparallel NNO– anion, and one oxygen atom belonging to the water terminal ligand.
The Dy1–O bond distances [average 2.374 Å] are in accord
with the normal values.4 The exact coordination
geometry of the Dy1 atom was analyzed in detail using the Shape software.44 The results indicate that it mostly belongs
to the biaugmented trigonal prism, in which the deviation value from
the standard C2v symmetry is only 1.230
(Table S1).

environment of the Dy1 atom in 1: symmetry codes: a:

along the [001] direction.

The most fascinating structural feature of 1 is that
the Dy3+ ions are connected to each other by the 4-connected
squarate bridges, generating a unique dysprosium(III) squarate double-layered
network along the bc plane (Figure 2). Each squarate anion bridges two Dy3+ ions from the above layer and two Dy3+ ions from
the bottom layer, adopting the coordination mode shown in Scheme 1e. These squarate
anions link to the Dy3+ ions along the short diagonal line
and long diagonal line of the bc plane, forming a
double-layered network similar to the famous single-layered (4, 4)
network. Notably, such a double-layered network has never been observed
in the LnMOF system before;41−43 it thus represents a new structural
paradigm of lanthanide squarate, although the single-layered structure
of lanthanide squarate has been recently observed in a 2D LnMOF displaying
a large magnetocaloric effect, [Gd(C4O4)(OH)(H2O)4]n,43 in which the squarate anion adopts the 3-connected bridging
mode shown in Scheme 1d. In the dysprosium(III) squarate double-layered network of 1, the Dy···Dy separation within each plane
layer is 6.064 Å, whereas the shortest Dy···Dy
separation between two plane layers is 6.041 Å.

Figure 2 Dysprosium(III) squarate
layer viewed along the (a) [100] direction
and (b) [001] direction.

Interestingly, several 3D Ln(III) MOFs with both the NNO– bridging ligand and oxalate bridging ligand have also
been reported
recently.45 In all of these compounds,
each oxalate anion just links to two opposite lanthanide(III) cations
as a bisbidentate ligand; this 2-connected coordination mode is quite
different from the 4-connected coordination mode observed in 1, so it is impossible to generate the similar “dysprosium(III)
squarate oxalate layer network” in these compounds.

To
complete the 3D framework of 1, the dysprosium(III)
squarate layers are linked to each other through the bridging of NNO– anions, which always appear in pairs, forming antiparallel
double bridges. The corresponding Dy···Dy distance,
separated by the NNO– double bridges, is 8.169 Å.
Taking the squarate ligand as a 4-connected node and the antiparallel
NNO– double bridges as a single linker, this 3D
topological structure may be simplified into a (4, 5)-connected network,
which was then analyzed by the Olex program, giving the long topological
(O’Keeffe) vertex symbol of 4.4.4.4.4.4.6.6.6.6 and the short
(Schläfli) vertex symbol of 46.64 (Figure 3). As far as we know,
complex 1 is the first LnMOF with both the heterocyclic
carboxylate bridging ligand and the squarate bridging ligand.

structure of 1: the long link represents
the double bridging NNO– ligands, whereas the Dy(III)
ion and the squarate ligand serve as the 5-connected and 4-connected
vertices, respectively.

Magnetic Properties
As shown in Figure 4, the magnetic susceptibilities determined
in a dc field of 1000 Oe indicated that the room temperature χT value of 14.15 cm3 K mol–1 is in accordance with the theoretical value of 14.17 cm3 K mol–1, corresponding to one isolated Dy3+ ion (6H15/2, S = 5/2, L = 5, and g =
4/3). Upon cooling, the χT product placidly
decreases upto around 50 K and then drops sharply to reach 12.16 cm3 K mol–1 at 2 K. The Curie–Weiss
equation was utilized to fit the magnetic susceptibility data for
2–300 K; the C and θ values of 1 were calculated to be 14.19 cm3 K mol–1 and −1.15 K, respectively (Figure S2). The small negative θ value suggests that the χT decline with a decrease in temperature mainly results
from thermal depopulation of the Dy3+ ions of the excited
Stark sublevels, which is generally induced by crystal-field perturbation.3,4 The dipole–dipole antiferromagnetic interactions among the
Dy3+ ions, if existent, will be very weak owing to the
large Dy···Dy separations, as mentioned above. The
field-dependent magnetization of 1 was measured at 2–6
K; nonsuperimposed M versus H/T plots
are clearly presented as the inset of Figure 4, indicating the existence of magnetic anisotropy
in 1.

Figure 4 Curve of χT vs T for 1. Inset: M vs H/T plots
of 1 measured at 2–6 K.

Ac magnetic susceptibilities of 1 were also
recorded
to probe the dynamic magnetic properties. The out-of-phase (χ″)
signals are almost negligible when the dc field is zero (Figure S3). However, these signals become significantly
intense and strongly frequency-dependent under a dc field. The field-dependent
ac susceptibilities recorded at 997 Hz and 2.5 K (Figure S4) indicate that the optimum field is 1000 Oe, which
may suppress the quantum-tunnelling effects; with this dc field, the
susceptibility peaks could be seen obviously when the frequency was
greater than 165 Hz (Figure 5a). These results suggest that there exist quantum-tunnelling
effects; such effects can be decreased by applying a dc field of 1000
Oe to eliminate the Dy(III) ion’s ground-state degeneracy.46,47

Plots of χ″ vs T under a dc field
of 1000 Oe for 1 (Hac = 2.5
Oe). (b) Plots of ln(τ) vs 1/T for 1, with the best fitting lines.

The Arrhenius law, τ = τ0 exp(Ueff/kT) (τ is the relaxation
time of the magnetization), was adopted to calculate the effective
thermal barrier. As shown in Figure 5b, the ln(τ) versus 1/T plots,
which are based on the χ″ peak temperatures at different
frequencies, could be fitted by the Arrhenius law, affording two effective
energy barrier values, Ueff/k = 8.5 K (τ0 = 1.2 × 10–5 s) and Ueff/k = 14.3
K (τ0 = 7.8 × 10–7 s), for
the fast relaxation phase (FR, in the low-frequency region) and slow
relaxation phase (SR, in the high-frequency region), respectively.
The τ0 values coincide with the expected values for
SMMs/SIMs (10–5–10–11 s).
The Ueff/k values of 1 are in the normal range for high-dimensional carboxylate-bridged
Dy(III) MOFs,12 but they are not remarkable.
There are several factors related to the effective energy barrier.
As shown in Table 1, the carboxylate-bridged Dy(III) MOF with the largest Ueff/k value contains the hydroxyl anion
bridging ligand, suggesting that the use of mixed carboxylate/hydroxyl
bridges yields high Ueff/k values, but this type of compound is rare. Another favorable factor
is ferromagnetic interactions between Dy(III) ions. However, complex 1 does not show any ferromagnetic interactions. The third
favorable factor is the high ligand field symmetry of the Dy(III)
ion.50 For complex 1, the
ligand field symmetry of the biaugmented trigonal prism for the Dy(III)
ion (C2v) is not as high as that of the
square antiprism (D4d),8,9 the
pentagonal bipyramid (D5h),16 and the octahedron (D8d),14 so the Ueff/k values of 1 are not large. In addition,
the degree of dependence of the χ″ peak temperatures
on frequencies could be assessed by the parameter Φ = (ΔTf/Tf)/Δ(log f) (f is the frequency).51 The Φ value of 1 is 0.52, which is in
good agreement with the Φ value of the superparamagnet (Φ
≥ 0. 1), but it is much larger than the Φ value (Φ
≤ 0.01) of spin glass,51 confirming
the SMM behaviors of 1.

To better understand the relaxation
characteristics of magnetization,
the isothermal frequency-dependent ac susceptibilities of 1 were also measured under a dc field of 1000 Oe. Five χ″
versus χ′ plots at 2.0–2.8 K are presented in Figure 6; all of them show
hooklike shapes, confirming a two-step relaxation process. Obviously,
the left and right parts of the hook-shaped curves are ascribed to
the FR and SR phases, respectively. All of these hook-shaped curves
might be fitted utilizing the sum of two modified Debye functions52−55 1  Table S2 lists
seven calculated parameters, χ0, χ1, χ2, τ1, τ2,
α1, and α2, at 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6,
and 2.8 K. The best fitting results are also visually presented in Figures 6 and S5–S9. The α1 values,
0.35–0.46, are somewhat smaller than the α2 values, 0.61–0.76, but all of these values are not small,
indicating that the relaxation time distribution is not narrow not
only for the FR phase but also for the SR phase. As mentioned above,
complex 1 has only one crystallographic independent dysprosium(III)
atom; therefore, the two-step thermal magnetic relaxation of 1 is ascribed to the field-inducing role.11,12,48,56−58 Notably, such a dc field-inducing two-step relaxation of magnetization
is seldom observed in high-dimensional Dy(III) MOFs, only two 3D Dy(III)
MOFs12,49 and two 2D Dy(III) MOFs behave similar multiple
relaxation of magnetization.11,48 Additionally, no any
magnetic hysteresis of 1 could been seen at 1.9 K (Figure S10).

Figure 6 Cole–Cole plots for 1 under a dc field of 1000
Oe at 2.0–2.8 K (Hac = 2.5 Oe),
with the best fitting lines.

Because the magnetic interactions among the Dy3+ cations
are almost negligible in 1, its magnetic properties are
mainly ascribed to single-ion behaviors. If we assume existence of
a Ising ground state in 1, which is very frequent for
low symmetry Dy3+ complexes, the electrostatic model installed
in the Magellan program59 could be applied
for estimating the magnetic anisotropy in 1. The calculated
results are shown in Figure 7, the magnetic axis directionality of the dysprosium(III)
ion is very close to the Dy1–O3 bond, with a small separation
angle of 6.67°.

Figure 7 Magnetic axis of the Dy3+ ion in 1, calculated using
an electrostatic method.

In summary, we have hydrothermally prepared a 3D LnMOF comprising
a novel dysprosium(III) squarate double-layered network. It shows
a (4, 5)-connected 46.64 topological structure.
Magnetic investigations reveal that it displays field-induced two-step
magnetic relaxation under a dc field of 1000 Oe, with Ueff/kB values of 8.5 and 14.3
K for the FR and SR phases, respectively. Such a field-induced multiple
thermal magnetic relaxation is rarely found in high-dimensional Dy(III)
MOFs. Our work demonstrates that noncarboxylic acid type of organic
polyprotonic acids can be also used as second bridging ligands to
construct mixed-bridge LnMOFs with novel structures and interesting
physical properties, like SMM behaviors; more such molecular materials
may be explored.

All chemicals are commercially
available. The elemental analyses were carried out using a FLASH EA1112
elemental analyzer. The infrared spectrum was determined on a BRUKER
TENSOR-27 spectrophotometer with a pressed KBr pellet. The X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Rigaku D/max 2500 diffractometer
with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. The magnetic
susceptibility measurements were performed using Quantum Design MPMS-XL5
with polycrystalline samples. Diamagnetic corrections were evaluated
from Pascal’s constants of all constituent atoms.

1.0 mmol of nicotinic acid N-oxide, 1.0 mmol of Dy(NO3)3·5H2O, and 15 mL of H2O was mixed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (25 mL) and
maintained at 170 °C for 5 days. After the reactor had cooled
to room temperature overnight, colorless block crystals of 1 (35% yield on the basis of Dy) were collected as the only crystalline

X-ray Single-Crystal Crystallography
A carefully chosen

× 0.11 mm3, was fixed on a Bruker SMART APEX-CCD diffractometer
with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) for collecting
diffraction data at 173(2) K. The φ scan was applied for empirical
absorption corrections. Cell parameters were calculated by global
refinement of the positions of all collected reflections. The direct
method was used to solve the crystal structure of 1,
and a full matrix least-squares technique based on F2 was applied to refine this structure using the SHELXL
97 program. All hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically, but all
nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The main crystallographic
data and structure determination parameters are reported in Table S3.
