Knowing the charge-transport
properties of molten oxides is essential
for industrial applications, particularly when attempting to control
the energy required to separate a metal from its ore concentrate.
Nowadays, in the context of a drastic increase of computational resources,
research in industrial process simulation and their optimization is
gaining popularity. Such simulations require accurate data as input
for properties in a wide range of compositions, temperatures, and
mechanical stresses. Unfortunately, due to their high melting points,
we observe a severe lack of (reproducible) experimental data for many
of the molten oxides. An alternative consists in using molecular dynamic
simulations employing nonempirical force fields to predict the charge-transport
properties of molten oxides and thus alleviate the lack of experimental
data. Here, we study molten alumina using two polarizable force fields,
with different levels of sophistication, parameterized on electronic
structure calculations only. After validating the models against the
experimental sets of density and electrical conductivity, we are able
to determine the various ionic contributions to the overall charge
transport in a wide range of temperatures.

Introduction
Molten
oxide systems, commonly referred to as slags, are of critical
importance particularly in the domain of metallurgy. Indeed, slags
are involved not only in the production of both ferrous and nonferrous
metals but also in refining technologies, coal gasification, and continuous
casting, to mention a few. A good knowledge of the thermodynamics,
physical, charge-transport, and thermal transport properties of slags
is needed for optimizing the industrial processes. Nowadays, due to
economical as well as environmental issues, reducing the energy consumption
of electric smelting processes and aluminium electrolysis is one of
the most important challenges of the metallurgical industry. The energy
needed for such processes is directly related to the partial ionic
conductivity of each charged species within the slag. Unfortunately,
there is a severe lack of experimental data for partial charge transport
properties of slags, even for key industrial systems. Of course, this
is detrimental when designing low-energy smelting processes. If we
take the specific case of aluminium: despite the fact that it is the
most abundant metal on earth, it is expensive, largely because of
the amount of electricity used up in its extraction process. Indeed,
aluminium is produced by the electrolysis of alumina, which is first
dissolved in a molten cryolite-based electrolyte. Designing processes
aimed at minimizing the overall energy consumption requires an accurate
knowledge of not only the total conductivity molten Al2O3 but also the partial conductivity of all charges involved
in the alumina electrolysis process as a function of temperature and
composition. For molten alumina, many experimental data of total ionic
conductivity are reported in the literature.1−6 Yet, all these results were obtained via the 4-point probes method.7 As pointed out by Schiefelbein et al.,8 this technique is inaccurate and consequently
large discrepancy is observed between each data set. For example,
close to the melting point (2327 K), the total conductivity reported
by Arkel et al.6 is about 20 times larger
than that reported by Wray and Neu.5 As
these data were measured with the same experimental method and in
the same period (1960s–1970s), it is difficult to critically
assess the total ionic conductivity by rejecting one or several data
sets. The temperature dependence of the total ionic conductivity of
molten Al2O3 is also in conflict. According
to Elyutin et al.4 and Wray and Neu,5 the total conductivity increases very slightly
with temperature, contrary to Arkel et al.,6 who observed a significant temperature dependence of the conductivity.
In principle, for molten oxides, the capillarity method would be the
most accurate experimental technique,8 but
it was applied on some slags with a melting temperature much lower
than that of alumina.9−12 Partial conductivity is a key property to characterize current efficiency
within an electrolysis cell. Unfortunately, no experimental data are
reported either for Al3+ or for O2–. Partial conductivity is a contribution of each
ion to total conductivity. The ratio between partial and total conductivity
is called the external transport number or transference number. The
external transport numbers of ionic molten systems are in general
measured via the Hittorf method13 and occasionally
with the so-called Moving boundary method.14 The Hittorf method has been successfully applied to measure the
cation external transport numbers for several pure molten salt compounds
and some binaries.15,16 For most molten oxides, due to
their high melting points, the external transport numbers have never
been measured. Note that most of the time, the external transport
numbers are estimated from the diffusion coefficient via Nernst–Einstein
(N–E) relationship. However, Nernst–Einstein equation
is only valid when the ion cross-correlations can be neglected.17 This is not the case for systems with strong
short-range ordering leading to the formation of coordination complexes.
In other words, Nernst–Einstein equation may be valid only
for simple and fully dissociated oxides like MgO and CaO.

To
alleviate conflicting and missing data on total ionic conductivity
and the lack of experimental data on partial conductivity, with this
work, we propose to predict the charge-transport properties of molten
alumina by equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD).

In prior works,18−24 we have already demonstrated that EMD, using interaction potentials
fitted from first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations
only, can predict the thermodynamic, dynamic, charge-transport, thermal
transport, and structural properties of molten salts and oxides with
appreciable accuracy. In a recent work,25 we have proposed a new formalism to extend the EMD capabilities
for the prediction of partial charge transport properties of molten
salts. Considering the same formalism, we propose to study the partial
charge transport properties within molten Al2O3. The predicted total ionic conductivity and density are compared
with the available experimental data to evaluate the reliability of
the EMD simulations, even if a large dispersion is observed between
different data sets. Furthermore, to explain the microscopic aspect
of the charge-transport properties, we focus on the correlation between
the total and partial conductivity, the local structure, and the charge–charges
effect.

Methods
Molecular Dynamic Simulations
The
simulations are performed
with the PIM code. Details on PIM can be found in.26,27 The procedure employed to perform the EMD simulations is the same
as that in our prior work.25 Two sets of
interionic potentials are used in this work. The first one (EMD-1
in the following) is taken from Machado et al.28

The interionic potentials consists of a Coulombic
repulsion term coupled with a Born–Mayer type interaction term,
together with dispersion and polarization interaction terms29 1  Vdisp describes
the dispersion interactions, with Cij6 and Cij8 as the dispersion coefficients. It accounts
for the short-range penetration correction to the asymptotic multipole
expansion of dispersion through Tang–Toennies damping functions, fij(n), expressed as30 2  Vpol is a polarization
term describing the distortion of the electronic density in response
to electric fields due to all other ions. The dipoles are determined
at each simulation time step by minimizing the total polarization
energy. The potential parameters are found ab initio by fitting the
dipoles and forces to those obtained by DFT calculations. The second
interionic potential (EMD-2) is taken from Ishii et al.31 It differs from the first one in two aspects.
First, it includes many-body effects on the short-range repulsion
between Al and O ions through the introduction of additional degrees
of freedom that mimic the change of radius and shape of the electronic
cloud of the oxide ion. Second, the parameters were derived from a
different set of DFT calculations (albeit conducted at the same level
of approximation). Note that the inclusion of additional many-body
effects is expected to improve the predictive ability of the potential,
but it comes at a cost: the simulations are slower by a factor 3–4
with respect to EMD-1. With both potentials, the simulations were
carried in the range of 2050 ≤ T ≤
3050 K by varying the temperature by a step of 100 K. The total number
of ions in the simulation box is, for all temperatures, 540 (216 Al3+ and 324 O2–). The
volume of the system was determined by a prior simulation in the isobaric–isothermal
statistical ensemble (NPT) at the corresponding temperature and at P = 105 Pa. Then, starting with a thermally equilibrated
initial configuration (generated by NPT simulation), another series
of simulations was performed on the canonical statistical ensemble
(NVT). The volume of the simulation box for NVT simulations was fixed
to the average volume determined by the NPT simulations. The temperature
was controlled with Nosé–Hoover thermostat32 for both NPT and NVT simulations. For the NPT
simulations, the pressure was controlled by an extension of the Martyna
barostat.33 The thermostat and barostat
relaxation times were both 0.5 ps. The equations of motion were integrated
using the velocity Verlet algorithm,34 with
a time step of 1 fs. The total simulation time was 1.5 ns for EMD-1
and 0.75 ns for EMD-2 for the NPT and 5 ns for both potentials for
NVT simulations. Lastly, all simulations were performed using periodic
boundary conditions and minimum image convention.

Theory
From the simulated phase trajectory, we calculated
first the self-diffusion coefficient under periodic boundary conditions
from the slope of the mean-squared displacements (MSD) versus time 3  where δra is the displacement of a given
ion of species i in time t. This
value depends on the box size,
so the correction proposed by Yeh and Hummer35 was included to obtain the correct self-diffusion coefficient Di0. To do so, it is necessary to estimate the
shear viscosity of the fluid, which can be obtained from the integral
over time of the autocorrelation function of the anisotropic elements
of the stress tensor σαβ 4  where β = 1/kBT (kB being the Boltzmann
constant) and V the equilibrium volume. An average
over five independent components of the stress tensor is performed
to improve the statistics. The MSD was fitted in the long time motion
region (t ⩾ 10 ps) to ensure linearity of
the MSD with time and thus avoid collision-free motion.

The
total ionic conductivity is obtained from the slope of the total MSD
of the charge density versus time36 5  where Zi is the formal charge of ion i. The most important
aspect of this paper is the study of the partial ionic conductivity
of molten oxides. The partial ionic conductivity, σi, results from the decomposition of the total ionic
conductivity into individual ion’s contribution, i.e.,: σ
= ∑iσi. Most of the time, in the literature, instead of the partial
conductivity, the external transport number ti = σi/σ
is used to quantify the relative contribution of each ion to the total
conductivity. The partial conductivity of i can be
formulated as25 6  where  and ωi–jj quantify the interferences from other species
on
ion i, i.e., the mutual effect upon the total conductivity
generated by various i – j pairs. Note that the ωi–j parameters are subjected to the constraint: ωi–ji + ωi–jj = 2. Similar to the
case of conventional solvents, for simple molten ionic compounds,
we have shown that the anion–cation interferences help to increase
only the external transport number (partial ionic conductivity) of
the cation at the expense of the anion. Indeed, in conventional solvents,
the transport numbers are defined in the framework of the solvent,
which is usually considered immobile in the presence of an electric
field. If there is no solvent, it is rather natural to confer an equivalent
role to the anions, since it is the cationic composition that mostly
varies. When ions are strongly correlated and form coordination complexes,
both cation and anions have similar interference contributions upon
the partial conductivity and thus25 7  It is important to note that the specific
case of ωi–jj = 0
is not equivalent to Nernst–Einstein approximation because
it accounts for correlations that may occur between same type of ions.
Indeed, Nernst–Einstein (N–E) approximation assumes
that the motion of ions within an electrolyte are uncorrelated. In
this case, the ionic mobility is proportional to the self (tracer)
diffusion coefficient and the partial conductivity of species i can be written as 8  where ρiis the density number of
the species of type i. Then, the total ionic conductivity
in Nernst–Einstein
approximation is given by σN–E = ∑iσiN–E. The calculated density
and the total and partial charge transport properties of the Al2O3 molten system are provided in Tables 1 and 2 for the EMD-1 and EMD-2, respectively. The standard error associated
with each property is calculated by the error block averaging method.37,38 A total of 15 blocks were considered for NPT simulations and 25
blocks for NVT. The number of blocks is proportional to the simulation
time and obtained after a convergence test. In the following, for
clarity purposes, the errors are only displayed on the figures if
they are significant.

Results and Discussion
In Figure 1, the
calculated density as a function of temperature is compared with the
available experimental data and the recent CALPHAD assessment proposed
by Robelin and Chartrand.39 The agreement
obtained with EMD-2 is overall very good, particularly with respect
to the most recent experimental data sets, which are the ones by Paradis
et al.41 and Langstaff et al.46 The predicted thermal expansion, which is 6.5
× 10–5 K–1 for this potential,
is also in good agreement with these data. The values are also consistent
with the ones obtained from the analysis of the density of multicomponents
molten oxides systems via interpolation methods.48,49 In the case of EMD-1, the density is overestimated by ≈4%
over the whole temperature range. Such an error is of the same order
of magnitude as the larger discrepancies between the various experimental
data, which shows that this potential remains almost quantitative.

Figure 1 Calculated
density of molten Al2O3 with the
potential 1 and 2 (solid squares and solid diamond connected with
dashed lines) as a function of temperature in comparison with the
experimental data (open symbols) and CALPHAD assessment39 (dash-dot line). Experimental data are referenced
as follows: Stankus and Tyagelsky40 (open
squares), Paradis et al.41 (open up-triangles),
Shpil’rain et al.42 (open down-triangles),
Rasmussen43 (open diamonds), Rasmussen
and Nelson44 (open stars), Hara et al.45 (open left-triangles), Langstaff et al.46 (cross), and Kingery47 (open hexagon). The melting temperature of alumina is indicated
by a vertical dashed line. The statistical error of EMD simulations,
obtained via block method, is found to be negligible, about 0.1%;
they are thus not reported in the figure.

The experimental and simulated viscosities are displayed
in Figure 2. As for
the density,
strong discrepancies are observed between various experimental data
sets. In particular, the data from Bates et al.52 clearly differ a lot from those of others. We observe that
above the melting point, the EMD-2 gives values that lie within the
other experimental data, showing that this model predicts correctly
the fluidity of the melt. The EMD-1 values seem to be slightly large,
an effect that may arise from the discrepancy already observed for
the density. At temperatures lower than the melting point, in the
supercooled regime, the EMD-2 deviates substantially from the only
available data from Langstaff et al.,46 but this may be due to the sampling of different structures, since
the system is metastable in this range.

experimental data (open symbols). The top (a) represents the viscosity
of both stable and supercooled molten Al2O3 at
a temperature up to 350 K below melting, whereas the bottom (b) represents
the viscosity of stable molten Al2O3 only, i.e.,
above the melting temperature. Experimental data are referenced as
follows: Glorieux et al.,50 Elyutin et
al.,51 Langstaff et al.,46 Bates et al.,52 and Blomquist
et al.53 The melting temperature of alumina
is indicated by a vertical dashed line. The statistical error of EMD
simulation is found to be negligible and not reported in the figure.

The calculated ionic conductivity
as a function of temperature
is represented in Figure 3, where it is compared with the available experimental data.
As for the other physical properties, a very large discrepancy is
observed between different experimental data sets (more than 1 order
of magnitude in the case of molten alumina). Of course, this is due
to experimental limitations when measuring electrical resistivity
at high temperature. From a practical point of view, it is precisely
in such situations that first-principles-based EMDs take their full
meaning. Indeed, given the apparent large discrepancy between each
data set, it is at first glance difficult to discuss the reliability
of EMD calculations. Nonetheless, here we clearly claim that in such
situations, EMD data should be considered as a reference, as the method
has already proven its high predictive capability for several dynamic
and transport properties for both simple and complex molten ionically
bonded systems.18−22,25 Our calculated ionic conductivities
are in good agreement with those of the two models. Both agree well
with some data sets for both liquid and undercooled Al2O3: specifically, those reported by Shpil’rain et al.1 from melting temperature up to 3000 K, and those
reported by Elyutin et al.4 below the melting
temperature as low as 2050 K. Experimental data reported by Aleksandrov
et al.2 and Arkel6 are much higher than the other data sets and EMD calculations as
well. The experimental data reported by Wray and Neu5 are very close to those of Elyutin et al.4 in the vicinity of the melting temperature, and thus in
good agreement with our EMD predictions, but they are almost temperature
independent, leading to a large discrepancy between EMD and Shpil’rain
et al.’s1 data at higher temperature.
The predicted temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of
molten Al2O3 follows a linear Arrhenius behavior,
i.e., σ ∝ e–Ea/RT, with an activation energy of Ea = 153.7 kJ mol–1, as determined
from EMD-1. The ionic conductivity of molten Al2O3 is relatively small in comparison that observed for simple oxides
such as MgO, CaO, or MnO;54 it can differ
by at least 1 order of magnitude. This large gap is clearly due to
differences in the local structure of the liquid: simple molten oxides
consist of fully dissociated ions, whereas molten alumina O2– and Al3+ form structural
complexes that would drastically decrease the ion’s mobility.
To put it in a nutshell, in the case of molten Al2O3, and more generally for slags, the reliability of the predictions
of ionic conductivity goes hand in hand with the accurate description
of the local structure. Few experimental data characterizing the local
structure of Al2O3 liquid are reported in the
literature. In fact, only the total structure factor was experimentally
determined by Ansell et al. via X-ray synchrotron radiation55 and by Landron et al.56,57 In addition to the structure factor, the average coordination number
of oxygen for aluminium was also measured by NMR technique.58−60

In Figure 4, the
calculated X-ray and neutron-weighted structure factors are compared
between the interaction potentials EMD-1 and EMD-2. They are determined
using 9  where k is the scattering
vector magnitude, cα is the atomic
fraction (of chemical species α), and wα is the atomic form factor in the case of X-ray or the
coherent neutron scattering length. Sαβ is the partial structure factor, obtained from the partial radial
distribution functions by performing a Fourier transform 10  where ρ is the atomic number density
of the glass. The similarity between the structure factors obtained
for EMD-1 and EMD-2 shows that the two models yield very similar structures
for the liquid. The results are in good agreement with previous experiments55,56 and simulations performed with a previous polarizable model, which
was also fitted on DFT reference data (albeit in the local-density
approximation approximation).61−63

The calculated and experimental average coordination numbers
of
Al about Al, nAl–Al, are almost
identical: 9.87 and 9.60 for EMD-1 and EMD-2, respectively vs 9.47
for the experiments. [The average coordination number is calculated
by the integration of RDF: nij = 4πρj ∫0rmingijr2 dr, where ρ
is the number density and rmin is the
position of the first minimum.] Similarly, the coordination number
of oxygen for aluminium nO–Al is
4.9 and 4.7 for EMD-1 and EMD-2, respectively, which compares well
with the experiment-derived values of 4.2 ± 0.3 reported by Landron
et al.,56 4.4 ± 1.0 reported by Ansell
et al.55 and 4.5 from NMR work of Florian
et al.58 It is important to note that a
strong charge ordering is apparent in molten Al2O3. From the simulations, a closer look at the local structure within
molten alumina can be obtained through the analysis of the distribution
of coordination numbers. The calculated probabilities of coordination
numbers of O2– about Al3+ are represented in Figure 5. According to our EMD-1 simulations, molten Al2O3 has 28% 4-fold coordinated, 53% 5-fold coordinated,
and 19% 6-fold coordinated aluminium atoms. This contradicts the generally
accepted consensus where the mean coordination number is dominated
not by 5-fold but rather 4-fold coordinated Al3+ leading to a local structure mainly formed of a tetrahedral network.
This consensus originates from the interpretation by Ansell et al.55 of their total structure factor measured by
X-ray synchrotron radiation. The NMR experiments are less categorical
about the Al3+ coordination number, suggesting
the presence of 4-, 5-, and 6-fold sites with an average coordination
number estimated close to 4.5,58,59 whereas our calculated
Al3+ average coordination is 4.9. However, the
present EMD calculations tend to overestimate the amount of 5-fold
coordinated Al3+ at the expense of 4-fold coordinated
Al3+.

and σiN–E/σi are known, respectively, as
the total and the partial Haven ratios (H); they
account for multiple-ion correlation effect64,65 upon the ionic conductivity. Haven ratios equal to 1 mean that the
ions are noncorrelated and therefore the charge transport should strictly
obey Nernst–Einstein law. In molten alumina, the ions are strongly
correlated, leading to a collective ion migration, which explains
why in the present work the total Haven ratio is found to deviate
from unity (see Tables 1 and 2). However, the total Haven ratio is
found to be less than one (about 0.75 for EMD-1 at 2050 K).

Contrary to the total Haven number, the partial haven number is
closer to unity and the external transport number of both O2– and Al3+ is close to 0.5,
indicating that they are evolving within coordination complexes, with
a negligible amount of free ionic species. To validate the ansatz
formulated in our previous work,25 given
in eq 7 for systems showing
a strong short-range ordering, let us consider the inverse situation
and calculate what would be the external transport if O2– and Al3+ were not complexed.
In this case, the interference coefficients are written as25 11  i.e., the interference only increases the
cations’ mobility at the expense of anions’. In this
case, we found that tAl3+ ≃
0.74 for all temperatures (EMD-1). This value matches exactly the
external transport number expected for fully dissociated mixtures
given by16 12  where r+(−) is the cation (anion) radius (rO2– = 1.26 Å and rAl3+ = 0.67 Å66) and z the ion charge. This confirms not only the ansatz proposed in our
previous work25 for both complex and dissociated
systems (eqs 6 and 8) but also the reliability of EMD calculations in
predicting external transport numbers.

Finally, it is worth
noting that the two models (EMD-1 and EMD-2)
provide similar electrical conductivities, whereas EMD-2 yields a
significantly lower conductivity. This also reflects on the diffusion
coefficients of both species, which are larger for EMD-2. This result
suggests that the correlation may differ in magnitude between the
two potentials. To test this, we followed the analysis of Kashyap
et al.,67 in which the total conductivity
is split between all its various contributions. First, two Nernst–Einstein
terms σiN–E terms, which reflect the uncorrelated
diffusion of the ions, and then three contributions arising from the
correlations 13   14   15  These five quantities are shown for all temperatures
in Figure 6. First,
we observe that they follow the same trend as in the case of room-temperature
ionic liquids and molten salts discussed in the work of Kashyap et
al.,67 i.e., large cancellations occur
between the self terms and the ones arising from correlations. Second,
from the quantitative point of view, the magnitude of the terms varies
consequently between EMD-1 and EMD-2. Indeed, the term arising from
the correlations between O and Al atoms (green line) is the only one
to take similar values between the two models. All other partial terms
are increased by roughly 50%. As a consequence, similar ionic conductivity
between the two models can be seen as a coincidence rather than a
generic future.

Figure 6 Comparison between partial conductivities: σAld, σOd, and σO–Ald with
Nernst–Einstein partial conductivity for O (σON–E) and
Al (σAlN–E) simulated with both EMD-1 and EMD-2 potentials.

Conclusions
In summary, the partial
charge transport properties of molten alumina
were studied via first-principle-parameterized equilibrium molecular
dynamics. The EMD predictions for both total and partial ionic conductivities
were found to be reliable. Although the polarizable model correctly
predicts the properties, the agreement is further improved by introducing
additional many-body effects in the short-range repulsion potential.
A correlation between the local structure and the total and partial
transport properties has been clearly established. Hopefully, this
work will open doors to the study of partial charge transport properties
within complex slag systems, for which experimental data are desperately
lacking.
