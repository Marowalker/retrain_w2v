The
present study focuses on the effects of nitrogen (N) ion implantation
in vertically aligned ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) and the photocatalytic
degradation of acetaminophen. The X-ray diffraction of these NRAs
exhibit a wurtzite structure with a predominant (002) diffraction
peak that shifts slightly after N-ion implantation. The field emission
scanning electron microscopic images of as-prepared NRAs show a length
of ∼4 μm and diameter of ∼150 nm. UV–visible
spectroscopy reveals that the band gap of pristine ZnO NRAs decreases
from 3.2 to 2.18 eV after N-ion implantation. Under visible irradiation,
the N-ion-implanted ZnO catalyst exhibits significant enhancement
of the photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen from 60.0 to 98.46%
for 120 min.

==== Body
Introduction
Acetaminophen is one
of the main active pharmaceutical components
of several commercial flu and cold medicines. Acetaminophen is also
used in analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory drugs for animals
and humans. It is also one of the most detectable pharmaceuticals
and emerging pollutants in various aqueous environments.1 It was found that 58–68% of acetaminophen
was extracted from the body after therapeutic use.2 Acetaminophen has been identified worldwide with 6 μgL–1 in a European sewage water treatment effluent,3 6.8 μL–1 in a wastewater
management plant in Korea,4 and more than
65 μL–1 in the Tyne River in the UK.5 When acetaminophen is used in excess, it leads
to death and liver failure.6 To remove
acetaminophen in the wastewater environment, innovative and dominant
oxidation techniques are required.

In recent years, visible
light catalytic degradation is an effective
method for the removal of organic
pollutants to resolve the above environment problems.7 Semiconductor-based oxides show excellent photocatalytic
activities for the degradation of pollutants in wastewater. Hence,
researchers are focusing on visible-light-driven photocatalysts.8 Semiconductors such as TiO2,9 ZnO,10 Fe2O3,11 WO3,12 and CdS13 are popular
photocatalysts that are used for the degradation of organic pollutants.
Among these materials, ZnO has created great interest because it has
a wide band gap energy (3.2 eV), high exciton binding energy of 60
meV, higher mobility, high stability, and it is environmentally friendly
and nontoxic.14 As ZnO absorbs UV light
owing to its wide band gap, efforts have been made to enhance its
photocatalytic activity under visible light by doping metal, nonmetal
ions, co-doping, and coupling with metal or semiconductors.15

ZnO has native defects because of Zn interstitials
(Zni) and O vacancies resulting in n-type semiconducting
behavior. Doping
nonmetal ions such as N, C, and S modifies the ZnO nanostructures
and shows the promising physical properties especially in the optical
properties. It is observed that the band gap reduces with N-ion implantation.16 Such a reduction is favorable for visible photocatalytic
activities. Apart from this, ion implantations are known to create
defects and also anneal the oxygen defects depending upon the energy
and ion fluencies. Modifications of the ZnO surface through the defect
states lead to band narrowing or defect band level to absorb the visible
energy. This also induces the different surface defective functionalities
in controllable depth and leads to the transformation of effective
surface features. Moreover, small formation energy is required for
the substitution of O in ZnO and hence N-ion is the most suitable
dopant.16

There are different chemical
and physical methods to prepare N-doped
ZnO, such as chemical precipitation,17 molecular
beam epitaxy,18 atomic layer deposition,19 hydrothermal,20 magnetron
sputtering,21 and ion implantation.22 Among these, ion implantation is a typical engineering
process and commonly used to alter the chemical and physical properties
of semiconducting materials. Compared to other doping methods, ion
implantation is also a reliable method to introduce impurities into
the ZnO. This study reports the synthesis of vertically aligned ZnO
nanorod arrays (NRAs) by a simple aqueous solution method and the
effect of low-energy N-ion implantation in ZnO. In addition, visible
light photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen in the presence
of N-ion-doped ZnO NRAs has been investigated.

Results and Discussion
Structural,
Surface, Morphological, and Optical Studies
The N-ion doping
on ZnO NRAs was performed by a low-energy ion beam
implantation of 100 keV. The ion fluences implanted in ZnO NRAs are
5 × 1014, 1 × 1015, 5 × 1015, and 1 × 1016 ions/cm2 and these
samples are hereafter referred to as N–ZnO1, N–ZnO2,
N–ZnO3, and N–ZnO4, respectively. Figure 1a displays the X-ray diffraction spectra
of pristine and N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs samples. The diffraction
peak at around 34.5° is attributed to the (002) crystal plane
of a wurtzite hexagonal ZnO. Absence of additional peaks in the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) show that N ion implantations do not form new phases
or modify the crystal structure. This implies that the N-ions are
either doped in place of O ion sites or occupy the vacancies of O
sites without modifying the crystal structure. This is consistent
with other studies.16 However, N-ion implantation
is expected to modify the crystallite size, surface morphology, and
optical properties.16Figure 1b represents a closer view
of the (002) plane of all the samples and the intensity of (002) peak decreases with increasing ion fluences. Moreover,
the peak position shifts slightly and this indicates doping of N-ions
on the ZnO NRAs. As the atomic radii of N (0.146 nm) are higher than
those of O (0.138 nm) but smaller than Zn, N ions substitute in the
O sites of ZnO. The N-ion substitution increases the lattice distance,
which is evident from the XRD. At higher ion fluences, N-ion concentration
increases and creation of defects also increases, which result in
reduction in the crystalline nature as evident in N–ZnO4. The
full width at half-maximum (fwhm) also changes with N-ion implantations.
As the defects density increases with ion fluences, strain is caused,
which disturbs the long-range order and eventually reduces the crystalline
nature manifesting as a reduction in integral peak intensity of the
XRD pattern and also change in fwhm. The peak shift reflects the strain
caused by ion implantation because of bond expansion or compression
and modifies the spacing between the crystallographic planes. Hence,
a compressional stress would result in the shift of the peak toward
higher 2θ value and tensile stress toward lower 2θ values.
The (002) peak shifts toward a higher diffraction angle as the ion
influence increases up to N–ZnO3 and decreases for N–ZnO4.
This is due to the defect creation over the different ion influences.
At a low ion fluence, the implantation leads to bonding of nitrogen
with Zn and reduces the lattice distance of ZnO. On increasing the
ion fluence, the implantation favors the creation of the Zn intestinal
states coupled with oxygen defect sites with loss of crystallinity.
Because of the high structural damage in high fluences and the high
interaction of N with Zn ions, the peak position blue shifts for the
N–ZnO4 samples as compared with N–ZnO3. The change in
defect states are confirmed through the photoluminescence (PL) measurements
(discussed in the latter part). At a higher ion fluence, N ion concentration
increases and the creation of defects also increases, which result
in the reduction in crystalline nature. Ion implantation causes the
defects and thus modifies the crystalline nature. It also relaxes
or anneals the defects, depending upon ion fluences. This small shift
in the XRD peak is related to the doping effect and results in defect
creation. This shows that the peak position in N–ZnO4 shifts
toward a lower 2θ value, which is a signature of the generation
of tensile strain.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns and (b) closer view of the (002) plane
of N-ion-implanted
ZnO NRAs.

The top view field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM)
images (Figure 2) clearly
show uniform vertically aligned ZnO NRAs for all the samples. From
the cross-sectional images, the average length and diameter of the
ZnO NRAs are found to be ∼4 μm and 200–250 nm,
respectively.

with various
fluences (insets show the cross-sectional images).

Figure 3 represents
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (a,d) and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) (b,e) images of pristine ZnO and N–ZnO4. The TEM
image of pristine ZnO exhibits a smooth surface. However, N–ZnO4
shows change in the surface roughness produced by ion implantation.
By increasing the N-ion fluences, the surface roughness increases
and reduces the crystalline nature of ZnO, which is consistent with
the XRD pattern reported above. A selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) shows a clear ring pattern of pristine ZnO NRAs (Figure 3c), indicating the crystalline
nature. In the case of N–ZnO4 (Figure 3f), the crystallinity decreases because of
the ion implantation. Further, the presence of N on the ZnO NRAs lattice
is evident from the PL and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
studies, which is discussed in the following sections.

Figure 3 TEM, HRTEM, and SAED
patterns of pristine ZnO (a–c) and
N–ZnO4 (d–f).

Figure 4a
represents
the UV–vis spectra of pristine and N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs.
The band edge of pristine ZnO is observed at 380 nm and this optical
edge shifts toward a higher wavelength, which clearly indicates that
the absorption shifts from the UV to the visible region. The band
gap energy was calculated by using a K-M (kubelka-munk) plot. The band gap energy of N–ZnO1, N–ZnO2, N–ZnO3,
and N–ZnO4 samples are 2.57, 2.28, 2.25, and 2.14 eV, respectively.
The band gap energy decreases with increasing the N-ion fluences.

and (b) PL spectra of pristine ZnO and N-ion-implanted
ZnO NRAs with different fluences, (c) XPS core-level spectra of Zn
2p, (d) O 1s, (e) N 1s of N–ZnO4, and (f) VB spectra of ZnO
and N–ZnO4.

The PL analysis of pristine
ZnO and N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs at
room temperature are shown in Figure 4b. The spectra consist of two dominant emission peaks
around 365–385 nm and 500–650 nm corresponding to electron
recombination from the near band edge to the valence band (VB) and
oxygen vacancies, respectively.24,25 The near band edge
emission intensity was found to decrease with increase in N-ion fluences.
This may be attributed to change in the unit cell upon N ion implantation
as evidenced from XRD analysis (decrease in intensity and increase
in fwhm (Figure 1b).
On increasing the N implantation to 1 × 1016 ions/cm2 (N–ZnO4), new emission peaks emerge at 415 and 440
nm because of formation of Zni levels below the conduction
band (CB).25 The defect emission of around
500–650 nm was also found to decrease with increase in N implantation.
The decrease in defect emission intensity represents substantial decrease
of electron recombination in oxygen vacancies. Figure S1a–e shows the possible mechanism of charge
transfer and separation in the ZnO and N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs. When
light is incident on ZnO, excited electrons transfer from VB to CB
and these electrons can recombine with holes quickly, which is shown
in Figure S1a. With the increasing of N-ions
in ZnO NRAs, a Zni state is formed below the CB and an
N state is formed above the VB because of the incorporation of N ions
in ZnO NRAs (Figure S1b–e). The
defect emissions of around 500–650 nm are also found to decrease
with increase in N-ion implantation. The decrease in defect emission
intensity represents the substantial decrease of electron recombination
in oxygen vacancies. The N-ions implanted are expected to occupy the
O vacancies and also bond with the Zn ions.

The PL lifetime
spectra of ZnO and N–ZnO4 NRAs are shown
in Figure S2. The decay plot was fitted
by the biexponential kinetics function26 1   2  where A1 and A2 are the corresponding amplitudes, τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow decay times,
and τavg is the average lifetime.

PL carrier
lifetime spectra for the pristine and N–ZnO4
samples were measured with excitation wavelengths of 395 and 460 nm
and are presented in table S1 in the Supporting
Information. PL carrier lifetime spectra show that the average lifetime
of ZnO and N–ZnO4 NRAs are 0.98454 and 0.0827 ns, respectively.
These results clearly show that the average lifetime was found to
decrease for the N-ion-implanted ZnO sample.

XPS measurement
was carried out to know the chemical state of Zn,
O, and N species in N-ion-implanted samples. Figure 4c represents the individual Zn 2p XPS spectra
of pristine ZnO and N–ZnO4. Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 binding peaks are observed at 1019.41 and 1042.41 eV, respectively.27,28 This result indicated the existence of a divalent oxidation state
in both pristine and N-implanted ZnO samples. For the N–ZnO4
sample, the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2 peaks showed
a slight chemical shift in binding energy compared to pristine ZnO
because of N-ion implantation.

Figure 4d illustrates
the O 1s core-level spectrum fit in three peaks.29 The peaks at 529.9 eV were mainly assigned to the oxygen
coordinated with Zn atoms (Zn–O). The peak at 531.1 eV was
attributed to the oxygen adsorbed on the sample surface and the peak
at 532.2 eV corresponds to the water molecules on the surface.

Figure 4e shows
the N 1s spectra of the N-ion-implanted ZnO sample. In the spectra,
the binding energy of 404 eV was not observed, which clearly suggested
that Ns molecules were not incorporated with ZnO crystal
by the ion implantation method. In N 1s spectra, the binding energy
was observed at 399.8 eV, which suggests that the N atom was partially
replaced with the oxygen atom in the ZnO crystal.30 The binding energy of N in zinc nitride at (396–397
eV), the greater binding energy at 398.8 eV should be related to the
formation of N–Zn–O bonds. Hence, it
is reasonable that the N 1s binding energy at 399.8 eV was observed
(O–Zn–N bond), which is higher than that at 396–397
eV (N–Zn–N bond).31

The VB values of pristine ZnO and N–ZnO4 are calculated
as 2.89 and 2.36 eV, respectively, using the VB XPS spectra as shown
in Figure 4f. After
N-ion implantation, the VB value decreases to 2.36 eV extended defect
states because of N implantation. The CB values have been calculated
from the following equation 3  where EVB is the
value of VB, ECB is the value of CB, and Eg is the band gap energy of the material.

Photocatalytic Activity
Figure 5a shows the photocatalytic degradation of
acetaminophen (20 ppm) under sunlight for 120 min using pristine ZnO
NRAs and N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs with various fluences. Before photocatalytic
degradation, the suspensions are placed in the dark for 20 min to
ensure adsorption/desorption equilibrium. The calculated degradation
efficiency of pristine ZnO NRAs is 41.53%. On the other hand, the
N-ion-implanted samples such as N–ZnO1, N–ZnO2, N–ZnO3,
and N–ZnO4 exhibit degradation efficiencies of 60, 90.61, 94.6,
and 98.46%, respectively. The degradation efficiency increases by
increasing the N-ion doping concentration in ZnO. Figure 5b shows a linear relationship
between degradation rate versus irradiation time, indicating that
the degradation of acetaminophen follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics.1The pseudo-first-order equation can be represented as 4  where C0 is the
initial concentration of acetaminophen, C is the
final concentration after photo-irradiation, t is
the photodegradation time, and k is the first-order
rate constant. The N-ion-implanted samples exhibit excellent photocatalytic
activities. The calculated apparent rate constants are 0.008, 0.02
, 0.024, and 0.038 min–1 for N–ZnO1, N–ZnO2,
N–ZnO3, and N–ZnO4, respectively. Moreover, the rate
constant of N–ZnO4 NRAs is 10-fold higher than that of pristine
ZnO NRAs (0.0045 min–1), indicating that N–ZnO4
shows a better photocatalytic activity than pristine ZnO.

Figure 5 (a) Photocatalytic
degradation efficiency of acetaminophen under
sunlight irradiation, (b) plot of irradiation time vs ln(C0/C), (c) reusable performance of N–ZnO4,
and (d) effect of scavengers on the photocatalytic degradation of
acetaminophen in the presence of N–ZnO4.

Reusability is a major factor in photodegradation as it is
difficult
to separate a powder-like catalyst from the pollutant. Instead, using
a film-like catalyst makes removal from the pollutant relatively easy. Figure 5c presents the reusable
performance of N–ZnO4 NRAs. The degradation efficiency decreases
from 98.46 to 97.63% after five repeated cycles. The slight decrease
in the photocatalytic activity during the recycling process may be
due to the small amount of residual acetaminophen present on the catalyst
surface.

Effect of scavengers on acetaminophen degradation in
the presence
of N–ZnO4 catalyst is shown in Figure 5d. Mainly, the reactive species involved
in the photodegradation process are superoxide anion radicals (O2•–), hydroxyl radicals (OH•–), electrons (e–), and holes (h+). Benzoquinone
(BQ, 1 mmol), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1 mmol), and
methanol (1 mmol) were used as O2•–, h+, and OH•– scavengers.32 Without adding a scavenger, the degradation
efficiency is 98.4%. After adding scavengers such as BQ, EDTA, and
methanol, the degradation efficiencies decrease to 28.52, 65.6, and
78.36%, respectively. These results clearly reveal that O2•–played a major role in acetaminophen degradation.

Semiconducting materials such as TiO2 and ZnO have been
widely studied for their photocatalytic activities. Owing to their
wide band gaps, these materials are inactive in the visible region.
The doping of nonmetals such as N, S, and F with ZnO shifts the light
absorption from the UV region to the visible region. Figure 6 shows the schematic diagram
of the mechanism of acetaminophen degradation under visible light
in the presence of N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs. The N-ion implantation
in the ZnO lattice leads to the formation of a new energy state, that
is, the N 1s band is observed above the O 1s of VB and shifted the
band gap to the visible region, which is evident from the absorption
spectra (Figure 4a).

Figure 6 Schematic
representation of the mechanism of acetaminophen degradation.

The degradation efficiency of
pristine ZnO NRAs was 41.53% and
those of N-ion-implanted samples such as N–ZnO1, N–ZnO2,
N–ZnO3, and N–ZnO4 were 60, 90.61, 94.6, and 98.46%,
respectively. ZnO NRAs possess a higher band gap (3.17 eV) and are
only active in the UV portion of sunlight. Photo (UV)-generated electrons
excited to CB and recombine quickly to the VB as indicated by the
carrier lifetime measurement. Some of the electrons from CB (band
edge) transfer to dye molecules and favor dye degradation (Figure
S1a in the Supporting Information).

N-ion implantation in ZnO NRAs creates localized states closer
to the VB associated with implanted N-ions (Figure S1b in the Supporting Information). These states are active
under the visible region of sunlight. Thus, N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs
are active in both UV and visible regions of sunlight and relatively
more numbers of electrons (compared to pristine ZnO NRAs) are excited
to CB and get transferred to dye molecules, resulting in faster degradation.

On further increasing the N-ion implantation dosage (N–ZnO4),
the localized donor state associated with the N-ion transferred into
extended states and shifts the VB position and reduces the band gap
as seen from VB spectra (Figure 4f). These defect states (N and Zni) reduce
the band gap substantially down to 2.14 eV and transform the N–ZnO4
sample to highly active under the visible region (Figure S1e in Supporting Information). Further, high N-ion
implantation favors formation of zinc interstitial levels formed below
the CB. PL carrier lifetime measurement carried out at 390 and 460
nm revealed that both the transition from VB to CB and Zni and vice versa are faster in the range of 0.0827 ns, which rules
out the involvement of charge traps in the carrier decay process.
As N–ZnO4 is highly active under the visible region, relatively
more numbers of electrons transfer to the dye molecule via band edge
and Zni levels (Figure 6). These results are well in correlation with reactive
oxygen species (ROS) (O2•–) production
as the generated O2•– radicals
were found to increase with N-ion implantation owing to enhanced supply
of electrons to the surface.

Conclusions
Vertically
aligned ZnO NRAs were synthesized by a chemical bath
deposition method and implanted with a low energy of 100 keV N-ions
at various fluences. These N-ion-implanted ZnO NRAs exhibit significant
visible light absorption owing to the presence of Zn–N bonding
and defects. This enhances the photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen,
attributed to the effective separation of photoinduced electrons and
holes. After five repeated cycles, there is no substantial decrease
in the degradation efficiency, indicating the high stability of the
catalyst. These results infer that O2•– is the main reactive species for effective acetaminophen degradation.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Zinc nitrate (Zn (NO3)2) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without
any further purifications.

Fabrication of Vertically Aligned ZnO NRAs
A two-step
process was adopted to synthesize ZnO NRAs.23 In the first step, a ZnO seed layer (buffer layer, thickness 150
nm) was deposited via DC sputtering on a precleaned glass substrate.
In a second step, to grow vertically aligned ZnO NRAs, aqueous solutions
of Zn(NO3)2 (25 mM) and HMTA (25 mM) were mixed
in an experimental flask. The seed layer-deposited substrate was submerged
into the flask, sealed, and maintained at 95 °C for 24 h. Finally,
the ZnO NRAs grown on the substrate were rinsed with distilled water
and ethanol and then dried at 100 °C in the air for 60 min.

Fabrication of N-Ion-Implanted ZnO NRAs
The N-ion doping
on ZnO NRAs was performed by using the low-energy ion beam facility
at the Inter University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi. This experiment
was carried out at room temperature with an ion energy of 100 keV
and ion fluences of 5 × 1014, 1 × 1015, 5 × 1015, and 1 × 1016 ions/cm2 and the samples are referred to as N–ZnO1, N–ZnO2,
N–ZnO3, and N–ZnO4, respectively. These N-ion-implanted
ZnO-NRAs are not subjected to the annealing step to recover the crystalline
damage or anneal the defects as defects play a major role in the photocatalytic
properties of the material.

Characterization
An XRD analysis
was performed using
an X’Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical) using Cu Kα
radiation. FESEM pictures were obtained using an FEI-Quanta-FEG 250
microscope. A Philips Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope was
used to record the images of the samples. XPS was performed using
a Thermo Scientific instrument equipped with an Al K Alpha X-ray source.
The PL spectra of the ZnO NRAs were measured with an excitation wavelength
of 325 nm. UV–vis spectra were obtained using a JASCO-V660
spectrophotometer.

Photocatalytic Experiment
In a typical
procedure, vertically
aligned ZnO NRAs (10 × 10 mm) are immersed in a 20 ppm acetaminophen
solution (5 mL). The solution is kept in the dark for 30 min in order
to attain adsorption/desorption equilibrium and irradiated under visible
light for various time intervals. The acetaminophen degradation is
determined by using UV–vis analysis. The degradation efficiency
is calculated by the following equation. 5  where C0 is the
absorption at zero time and Ct is the
absorption at a given time t.14
