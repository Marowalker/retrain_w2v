The
morphology and band gap of silver oxide thin films have been
tuned by radio frequency reactive magnetron sputtering to deposit
transparent, visible-light-activated photocatalytic biomaterials with
excellent antimicrobial properties. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 binding energy peaks have been used to study
the chemical composition of the films, and the deposition of two antimicrobial
phases of silver oxide, namely, Ag2O and Ag4O4 was confirmed. The optical band gaps of the films were
determined by optical spectroscopy and are in the range 2.3 eV (539.6
nm) to 3.2 eV (387.8 nm). Strong transmission of up to 80% was observed
in the visible region around 650–750 nm. Silver ion release
on the surfaces of the films was monitored using atomic absorption
spectroscopy, and sustained silver ion release in both water and saline
solution for 24 h was confirmed. Nanocrystallites of sizes between
2.45 and 31.30 nm were observed on the surfaces. The films were challenged
with two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and
two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) during
antimicrobial activity tests using killing curve analysis with 100%
contact killing recorded in 25 and 5 min, respectively. The mechanism
of antimicrobial efficacy is suggested to be due to silver ion release,
small crystallites, and the ease of ligand replacement in the silver
oxide stoichiometry, their exchange and interactions of ligands in
the microbe’s biological systems. Our current finding opens
the door to furthering the development of visible-light-activated
antimicrobial surfaces.

1 Introduction
The sustained fight against pathogenic microorganisms due to their
negative effect on living matter has been on for ages. Scientists
and researchers from different fields are engaged with this process,
and several tools have been used over the years to offer a solution
to this problem. The introduction of antibiotics in the early 20th
century was a major game changer in the fight against microorganisms.
Recently, however, resistance of microbial infections to multiple
antibiotic treatments has been reported. Resistant bacterial species,
also referred to as superbugs, are classified into three categories,
namely, the critical, high, and medium resistance groups. This situation
has therefore led to the need to develop antimicrobial thin film coatings
that can effectively deal with this problem especially on surfaces
in hospital environments like medical textiles, medical equipment
like catheters, and medical implants under visible-light-activated
photocatalysis.1 The most promising materials
evaluated to date for this application include silver nitride and
oxynitride films prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering and activated
with indoor visible light photocatalysis reported by Rtimi et al.2,3 Leyland et al.4 have also recently (2017)
reported doping titanium dioxide coatings with copper and fluorine
using sol and dip coating to prepare a visible-light-activated antimicrobial
coating.

Metals play vital roles in the structure, function,
and dynamics
of biological systems.5−7 Phosphorus is essential in both the DNA double helix
and cell energetics in adenosine triphosphate.8−12 The electrical flux generated due to the movement
of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane transmits information
in the nervous system.6,7 Metals were extensively used for
disinfection and antimicrobial treatment before the advent of antibiotics.13,14 Metals can be replaced with coordination complexes of biological
systems and therefore used to alter their structure, function, and
dynamics.

Transition metals such as gold, silver, copper, and
titanium have
been used as antimicrobials either as metals, alloys, or oxides due
to the peculiarity of their chemistry.15 Copper and its oxides have demonstrated good antimicrobial properties
being reported as effective antimicrobials with the capacity of killing
up to 99.9% of bacteria in contact with them in approximately 2 h.16,17

For an antimicrobial material to be effective, it must have
the
ability to cause multiple attack on microbes. A simultaneous attack
on the cell wall, DNA, and protein synthesis destroys the bacteria’s
defense, leaving little room for resistance.18−20

The generation
of electron–hole pairs in semiconductors
through the photocatalytic process provides potent antimicrobial properties.
In addition, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydroxyl
radicals as well as metal ion release provides the necessary tools
for killing microbes.21

Titanium
dioxide has been extensively researched and used as a
photocatalyst due to its low cost, easy availability, and photochemical
stability.22,23 It however has a band gap of
about 3.1 eV and is excited using ultraviolet light, which imposes
a limitation in its utilization for some applications.24 Some of the approaches used to obtain visible-light-activated
photocatalysts include doping of titanium dioxide and dye sensitization.25−28 The development of a photocatalyst that is an undoped single compound,
cheap enough, and activated using visible light has remained a major
challenge to date.

The band gap and morphology of semiconductor
thin films can be
tuned using deposition parameters such as oxygen flow rate, forward
power, and chamber temperature during deposition. In this investigation,
the band gap and morphology of a multiphase but undoped single compound
silver oxide thin film was varied using reactive magnetron sputtering
and two parameters, the forward power and oxygen flow rate, during
deposition using the conditions shown in Table 1, to obtain a semiconductor biomaterial that
is optically transparent, photocatalytic under visible light, and
has antimicrobial properties. The previous investigations on photocatalytic
silver oxide films were based mainly on the dissociation of dyes,26−28 while our present investigation is focused on their antimicrobial
killing effect on the microbes investigated in this paper.29 Silver oxide photocatalysts have been investigated
and reported to be very stable after eight cycles of use on methyl
orange, phenols, and methyl blue.30

2.1 Deposition Conditions
The deposition
conditions used to produce the silver oxide thin films are presented
in Table 1

The
thickness of the silver oxide films deposited increased with deposition
power. The average thicknesses of a selection of films were measured
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and are presented in Table 2. The rate of deposition
of the oxides of silver varies with forward deposition power, and
typical values are presented in Table 2.

coli, (B) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (C) Staphylococcus aureus, and (D) Staphylococcus epidermidis on silver oxide surfaces.

2.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Analysis
The XRD spectra for the as-deposited thin films
are shown in Figure 2A.

Figure 2 (A) XRD spectra of silver oxides deposited at different oxygen
flow rates at 300 W forward power and (B) Raman spectrum of silver
oxide deposited at 100 W power and 10 sccm oxygen flow.

Both silver and its oxides AgO and Ag2O previously
reported
in the literature are observed in our analysis.14,29 Dellasega et al.31 also previously reported
observing tetragonal and monoclinic antimicrobial phases of Ag4O4 in their silver oxide films. We observed the
Ag4O4 phase in our XRD spectra of the films
deposited at a forward power of 100 W and an oxygen flow rate of 10
sccm as reported by Dellasega.32 We also
detected Ag2O in our films produced at 400 W forward power.33

The crystal sizes of the deposited silver
oxide thin films were
calculated using the Schuler formula34 1  where D is the crystal size,
λ is the wavelength of X-rays (Cu Kα = 1.54 Å), θ
is calculated from the 2θ angle, and β is the full width
at half-maximum (FWHM). The full width at half-maximum was obtained
by Gaussian–Lorentzian fitting of the XRD spectra using Magic
plots software. The crystallite sizes are presented in Table 3.

2.4 Raman Spectroscopy
The details of
the phases observed in our Raman analysis for films prepared at 100
W forward power are shown in Table 4.

100	423	29.06	Ag2O, Ag4O4	
100	477	32.06	Ag2O, Ag4O4	
The major phases in our deposited films are
AgO, Ag2O, and Ag4O4 for the films
prepared at 100
W forward power. The same phases were observed for all of the films
we prepared between 100 and 400 W forward power, although additional
Raman peaks associated with these phases were observed. A typical
Raman spectrum obtained in our investigation is shown in Figure 2B. The irreducible
representation from group theory was used to predict vibrational modes
that are Raman-active. The irreducible representation of silver oxides
indicates that Ag2O has the following vibrational modes33 2  The analysis predicts three active modes like
the prediction for the Cu2O structure. The 3T1u modes are infrared-active, while the T2g mode is Raman-active.
The T1u symmetry infrared-active modes are due to relative
motion of the silver and oxygen lattices and are responsible for the
asymmetric Ag–O stretching mode as well as the asymmetric O–Ag–O
bending mode vibrations observed. The T2g Raman active
mode about the symmetry center at Ag(I) is generated by the O2− ions and is assigned to Ag−O stretching
vibration. The Ag2O phase of silver oxide does not display
Raman and infrared activity due to its inversion symmetry.

The
nature of the optically active vibrational modes for monoclinic
AgO was established using factor group analysis. The C2b factor group and the two Ag(III) and two Ag(I) ions in the primitive
cell sites of C1 symmetry and four O2– ions in the C1 sites are used for establishing
the vibrational modes of silver oxide.33 The vibrational modes resulting from the analysis are 3  Monoclinic AgO is found to have 21 optically
active modes, 15 of which are infrared-active and 6 are Raman-active.33

2.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS)
The XPS survey and deconvoluted high-resolution spectra
for the deposited
samples are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 XPS binding energy spectra of samples deposited at 300 W power
and 10 sccm oxygen: (A) survey, (B) oxygen high-resolution, and (C)
silver Ag 3d spectra.

The XPS analysis of the
samples indicates the presence of mixed
phases of silver oxides Ag2O and AgO in silver, which agrees
with both XRD and Raman analyses conducted on the samples. The XPS
core-level binding energies of around 374 eV35 corresponding to silver were observed to be present in all of the
samples, confirming the observation of strong absorption spectrum
of the sample reported at about 370 nm in optical spectrophotometry
of the samples. The silver associated with AgO was observed to be
at a binding energy of 367.1 eV,36 suggesting
the presence of a mixture of Ag and AgO (Figure 3C). Silver associated with Ag2O is reported at a binding energy of 367.7 eV, implying the mixture
of the two in the sample. The O 1s binding energies in the high-resolution
spectra of oxygen are reported in the literature to belong to AgO
and Ag2O, while some are assigned to superoxide, hydroxyl
and carbonate groups. The presence of superoxide and hydroxyl groups
confirms the antimicrobial properties of the oxides since the presence
of these groups is very potent against bacteria.37 The O 1s peak in AgO was observed at 530.1 eV, in agreement
with earlier literature report,38 confirming
the presence of this phase in the sample, while the binding energy
observed at 528.6 eV is due to Ag2O39,40 in the sample as shown in Figure 3B. The presence of the O 1s peaks at binding energies
between 530 and 532 eV is indicative of the presence of carbonates,
superoxide, and hydroxyl group.41,42

2.6 Optical
Transmittance, Reflectance, and Band
Gap
Optical transmittance and reflectance for the as-deposited
silver oxide thin films were measured in the 350–1100 nm wavelength
range using the Aquila nkd-8000 spectrophotometer. The Aquila optical
spectrophotometer was calibrated using fused silica, which also served
as the reference for the optical measurements. A plot of absorption
and transmittance spectra as well as the absorption coefficient versus
wavelength or photon energy for direct band gap for each sample was
generated for silver oxide. The thicknesses of the deposited films
were measured using an image analysis software attached to the scanning
electron microscope. The optical spectrophotometer measurements on
our prepared silver oxide thin film samples indicated that the silver
oxides transmit up to 80% of light incident in the wavelength range
between 650 and 750 nm, which is in the visible region as presented
in Figure 4A–C.

Figure 4 (A) Tauc
plot for silver oxide deposited at 100 W power and 6 sccm
oxygen flow, (B) transmittance spectrum of silver oxide deposited
at 400 W and 10, 8, and 6 sccm oxygen flow, and (C) absorption coefficient
as a function of wavelength for silver oxides deposited at a power
of 400 W and varied oxygen flow rates of 10, 8, and 6 sccm.

The transmission spectrum was generated from the
equation43 4  where I0 and I are the intensities of the incident
and transmitted light
beams, respectively. The absorption coefficient was plotted using
the relationship44 5  which links the optical absorption
coefficient
(α) and thickness (d).

Tauc’s
relation45 expressed in eq 6 was used to determine
the band gap of the thin films 6  where h is Planck’s
constant, ν is the photon frequency, and Eg is the optical band gap.

Tauc plots were generated,
and the linear portion of the curves
was extrapolated to the hν axis to give an
estimate of the band gap. The direct optical band gap to the first
approximation is a straight line, which when extrapolated touches
the photon energy axis at the band gap value. The typical plot obtained
is as shown in Figure 4A. The band gap values obtained were between 2.3 eV (539.6 nm) and
3.1 eV (387.8 nm) depending on deposition conditions used for preparing
the silver oxide films and span both the ultraviolet and visible ranges
of the solar spectrum, consistent with other reports in the literature.46−48 The silver oxides can therefore be activated as photocatalysts using
visible light and thus eliminating the use of ultraviolet radiation
for activation. It was also observed that the silver oxides deposited
absorbed solar radiation at about 370 nm as shown in Figure 4C.

2.7 Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy
Silver
ion release was observed in both water and saline solution as shown
in Figure 5A,B.

Figure 5 Silver ion
release from silver oxide deposited at 200 W power and
10 sccm oxygen flow in (A) water and (B) saline solution.

The ion concentration in water was observed to be higher
than that
in saline solution. The lowest concentration of 0.5343 ppm was recorded
for silver oxide deposited at 400 W power after exposure for 12 h,
and the highest value of 33.0152 ppm was observed for silver deposited
at 300 W after exposure for 24 h. The silver oxide deposited at 200
W showed a low ion release in the first 1 h, which builds up to higher
values after 6 and 12 h. The results indicate that silver ions are
released in both water and saline solution and that the release is
sustained for 24 h, which confirms that the silver oxide thin films
can function as antimicrobial material surfaces. The availability
of silver ions on the surfaces to both initiate and sustain antimicrobial
activity in water or saline solution is guaranteed. The silver ions
released in water and saline solutions can then attach to bacteria
or penetrate the bacteria, leading to a disruption of the chemical
structure and function of the biochemical components inside the bacteria.

2.8 Results of Antimicrobial Tests and Killing
Curves for Microbes
The results obtained are as shown in Figure 6A–D representing
the killing curves for the microbes we investigated after the exposure
of bacteria at different time intervals to silver oxide, silver, and
microscope glass slide control surfaces, respectively.

and 400 W forward powers each at 10 sccm oxygen flow, silver at 300
W, and glass slide for (A) E. coli,
(B) P. aeruginosa, (C) S. aureus, and (D) S. epidermidis.

2.9 Statistical
Analysis
A Student’s t-test statistical
analysis was performed with the surfaces
as independent variables while the log of colony forming units (CFUs)
was the dependent variable, and the result is presented in Tables 5 and 6 for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively.

No statistically significant differences in the means of the log
of colony forming units was observed between the silver oxide surfaces
prepared at 100, 300, and 400 W forward power during deposition for
all of the four microbes under study. There was no statistically significant
difference in the mean of log of the colony forming units as indicated
below(1) E. coli: 100 vs 300 W (p > 0.991);
100 vs 400 W (p > 0.969); 300 vs 400 W (p > 0.978).

(2) P. aeruginosa: 100 vs 300 W (p > 0.965); 100 vs 400 W (p > 0.809);
300 vs 400 W (p > 0.842).

(3) S. aureus: 100
vs 300 W (p > 0.494); 100 vs 400 W (p > 0.419); 300 vs 400 W (p > 0.913).

(4) S. epidermidis: 100 vs 300 W (p > 0.884); 100 vs 400 W (p > 0.906); 300 vs 400 W (p > 0.978).



Statistically significant differences were
observed between the
means of the colony forming units for each of the four bacteria on
all silver oxide-coated substrates compared with the control silver-coated
and the uncoated glass substrates over the time considered. The details
of the findings for each microbe are as follows:(1) E. coli: All comparisons between silver oxides (prepared at 100, 300 and
400 W) at 10 sccm oxygen flow and the control surfaces (silver, glass)
indicated a statistically significant difference in the means of the
colony forming units, and all were at p < 0.05
level of significance.

(2) P. aeruginosa: A similar pattern observed
in E. coli was observed for this microbe.
All comparisons between silver oxides
(prepared at 100, 300, and 400 W) at 10 sccm and the control surfaces
(silver and glass) indicated a statistically significant difference
in the means of the colony forming units, and all were at p < 0.05 level of significance.

(3) S. aureus: The
microbial colonization levels for the silver oxide-coated substrates
compared to the silver-coated and uncoated glass substrates were all
at p < 0.001 level of statistical significance.

(4) S. epidermidis: The microbial colonization levels for the silver oxide-coated substrates
compared to the silver-coated and uncoated glass substrates were all
at p < 0.001 level of statistical significance.



One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
conducted on the data
obtained from the killing curve measurements to test whether there
was any significant difference between the means of the log of colony
forming units with time at different time intervals on samples at
different deposition conditions. The level of significance was set
at 0.05 or 5%. The null hypothesis set was that there is always no
significant difference between the means of the log of colony forming
units for bacteria in contact with surfaces. Results obtained from
the ANOVA test indicate that the p values for all
of the four microbes were less than 0.05, implying that at least there
is a pair of data set whose means are significantly different from
each other, thus justifying the conduct of the post hoc Tukey test
to find out which pair has statistically significant difference in
the means of log of colony forming units. A post hoc Tukey test was
therefore conducted, which confirmed that the means of their colony
forming units on the tested surfaces were statistically significantly
different (p < 0.05). Our investigation shows
that the silver oxide surfaces are antimicrobial with the capacity
to kill the microbes examined in this investigation within a maximum
of 20 min of exposure to the silver oxide surfaces as shown in Figure 5a–d. E. coli and P. aeruginosa are unable to survive on the silver oxide surface for more than
5 min, S. aureus survives between 10
and 15 min, and S. epidermidis survives
up to a maximum of 20 min. The microbes however continue to grow on
both the silver and the uncoated microscope glass slide control surfaces
up to 60 and 90 min after exposure, respectively.

3 Discussion
Wang et al.46 and
other researchers30,47,48 proposed the following basic
reaction mechanisms for the photocatalytic dissociation of chemical
dyes using Ag2O in the visible light regime on different
chemical dyes including methyl orange. The process starts with the
irradiation of Ag2O with light energy lower than or equal
to its band gap energy of 1.9 eV, leading to the generation of electron–hole
pairs that migrate to the surface, i.e. 7  In an aqueous
environment, the electron–hole
pairs will react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS),
hydroxyl radicals •OH, and superoxide anions as
indicated below 8   9  The photocatalytic dissociation of chemical
dyes through the above reaction mechanisms will involve the following
reactions 10   11  The above reaction pathways for silver
oxide
exposed to an aqueous environment are also supported by density functional
theory calculations.30 The above photocatalytic
dissociation in combination with silver ion release in solution confirmed
by our atomic absorption spectroscopic measurements and the nanosized
particles evaluated from X-ray diffraction analysis provides the necessary
chemical entities for the antimicrobial interaction of silver oxide
with microbes as discussed below.

These results from the antimicrobial
tests agree well with the
earlier results from ion release, XPS, Raman, XRD, and optical characterization
measurements, which confirmed that the silver oxides are photocatalytic
and contain antimicrobial silver oxide phases and crystallite sizes
between 2.45 and 31.30 nm. The results also indicate potentially that
the silver oxides are better antimicrobial materials compared to silver,
which is also reported to be antimicrobial. The nanocrystallites are
small enough to pass through the pores in the bacterial cell membrane,
which are 2–3 nm,49,50 resulting in a simultaneous
attack on inner biochemical components such as DNA/RNA and proteins,
while the other crystallites attack the cell membrane. This multiple
attack does not permit the bacteria to develop resistance against
the attack. The band gap of the mixed-phase silver oxide materials,
which ranges between 2.3 and 3.1 eV, is also in the visible region
of the solar spectrum, suggesting that the material can be activated
using sunlight. Our antimicrobial tests were carried out under ordinary
sunlight under room conditions in the absence of ultraviolet lamps,
and the killing effect was quite pronounced for both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria.

The killing mechanism of the bacteria
exposed to silver oxide films
in our investigation is believed to be affected by an initial photocatalytic
dissociation into silver ions, reactive oxygen, superoxide, and hydroxyl
radicals. The presence of these radicals and silver ions confirmed
by our ion release measurements in solution in an aqueous environment
leads to ligand and metal complex replacements in the cell membrane,
DNA, and proteins in the bacteria and the killing of the bacteria
as previously reported.29

It has
been established that silver ions interact with the cell
wall, resulting in antimicrobial activity. The interaction with the
cell wall paves the way for penetration of silver-containing species
into the interior of the cell to interact with biochemical components
such as DNA and enzymes. Holt and Bart51 reported that E. coli when exposed
to silver ions permitted 60% transportation of the ions into the interior
of the cell, while 40% interacted with the cell membrane. This interaction
causes lysis and detachment of the cell membrane from the cell wall
as well as creates an electron-light region, which originally was
dense, resulting in loss of replication ability of the bacteria.52

Atomic silver (Ag0) is inert,
but the ionic forms Ag+ and Ag2+ are reactive.
The Ag+ ion
with its d10 electronic configuration has zero-ligand field
stabilization energy and readily forms labile complexes in which there
is rapid exchange of the original ligand set for new ligands available
from the surrounding system. Ligand-exchange reactions have suggested
the relative order of Ag+ bond strength to be52−58  The mechanism
of the antimicrobial activity
of silver is observed to involve three interactions, namely,(1) the inhibition of
transport functions
in the cell wall, which affects respiration

(2) the interruption of cell metabolism
by changing the enzyme structure, and

(3) inhibition of cell division in its
interaction with DNA.52−58



This multiple attack of silver ions
on microbes is very effective
and unique and reduces the possibility of resistance development by
microbes.52−58 Several significant structural and morphological changes occur in
bacteria after exposure to silver ions such as an electron-light region
observed in the center of the cell containing a tightly condensed
substance twisted together, a big gap between the cytoplasmic membrane
and the cell wall, and the presence of some electron-dense granules
around the cell wall.52,54 The DNA is effectively replicated
when DNA molecules are in a relaxed state, but the replication ability
is lost when DNA cells are condensed, and this happens when silver
ions penetrate the bacterial cell wall. This subsequently results
in the death of the bacterial cell. Protein groups are also inactivated
when heavy metals react with proteins by attachment. In this interaction,
silver inhibits the uptake of phosphate and the release of phosphate
mannitol, succinate, proline, and glutamine in E. coli. The antimicrobial activity of the silver(I)-based complexes is
controlled by the weak binding property of the Ag–O bond and
accounts for the ease of ligand replacement in the complex. In biological
system, the ease of ligand replacement in the silver (I) complexes
would result in further replacement with biological ligands. Ligand
replacement is observed for O–, N–, and S– donor atoms. The weak Ag–O and
Ag–N bonds exhibit antimicrobial and antifungal activities,
while the major inhibitors of bacteria and yeast growth are the sulfur
atoms in proteins. The silver(I) ion freely interacts with ligands
in proteins, enzymes, and cell membranes, which have a rich supply
of the donor atoms replacing them and resulting in the antimicrobial
activity of the complex.53 Silver(I) ions
are released into the biological system by coordinating ligands in
the silver(I) complex. The efficacy of the antimicrobial activity
of the complex is defined by the ease of ligand replacement in the
complex. According to Tajmir-Riahi et al.,55 Ag(I) binds very strongly with nucleic acids, resulting in the formation
of many complexes with the DNA. Type I complexes result when silver
binds with guanine and adenine at the N7 site at low and high concentration
ratios of Ag and nucleotide. Type II complexes are formed between
the Ag(I) ion and G–C and A–T base pairs. The antimicrobial
and other desirable properties of the complexes can be changed by
varying the type and number of ligands coordinating with the Ag(I)
ion in the complex.56 Some of the key factors
used in the design of silver-based antimicrobial complexes are as
follows:56(1) The type of atoms bound to the Ag+ ion.

(2) The ease of
ligand replacement and
control of Ag+ ion release.

(3) Chemical and photostability.

(4) Cost.



The bonding
between the silver ion, Ag+, and enzymes
available in the bacterial respiratory chain initiates the production
of reactive oxygen species in large quantities due to inefficient
electron passage at the terminal oxidase, providing an explanation
as to why the silver(I) ion is toxic to bacteria. The rate of metal
ion release and the relative stability of any silver complexes can
be controlled using variations in the ligand architecture and the
overall structural motif of the compound.

Izatt et al.57 further confirmed that
three modes of binding are distinguishable in the silver–DNA
binding. The guanine N7 site is a major binding site at Ag/nucleotide
concentration ratios between 0.2 and 0.5, while type II involves A–T
and G–C base pair sites and often results in proton liberation.
Type III is observed when the major binding sites for type I and type
II complexes are saturated. Wu et al. also reported58 that the silver–DNA binding causes the DNA to switch
from its B-form structure, which originally is twisted to a flat base
pair structure for type I complexes. In type II complexes, the flat
base structure switches back to the propeller base pair structure.
In their report, Arya and Yang59 observed
that type I complexes are formed from a mixture containing Ag(I) and
calf-thymus DNA at a molar ratio of 1:5 and that Ag(I) binds to guanine
but not to adenine, cytosine, thymine and the backbone phosphate groups.

Although silver ions bind readily with ligands and molecules as
well as proteins in the human body, including albumins and metallothioneins
and interact with trace metals in metabolic pathways, silver release
occurred at such a relatively slow rate and low concentrations that
it does not pose a threat to the human body. Ag+ has been
reported to lead to the uncoupling of the respiratory chain from oxidative
phosphorylation, a collapse of the proton motive force across the
cytoplasmic membrane, and the interaction with thiol groups of membrane-bound
enzymes and proteins.60−62 The cytoplasmic membrane contains proteins and enzymes
vital to the respiratory chain and key transport channels and has
been severally suggested as a primary target site for biocidal activity
of the silver ion at low concentrations.60−63 Silver ions interact with cytoplasmic
components inside the cell at higher concentrations.62,63

The effectiveness of the antibacterial activity of silver
ions
even when present in low concentrations has been further highlighted
in the literature by Rtimi et al.,64 who
explained E. coli inactivation in Zr–NO–Ag
co-sputtered surfaces through the oligodynamic effect.

We believe
that a similar or related mechanism may be operating
in the recently described “Zombie killing effect” induced
by silver ions in bacteria,65 also expressed
through the equation 12  Our current finding on visible-light-activated
undoped antimicrobial silver oxide coatings also provides the additional
advantage of an improved simple integrated fabrication route based
on reactive magnetron sputtering, alongside other significant recent
advances based on doped silver nitrides and complex silver oxynitrides,
as well as doped titanium dioxide coatings with copper and fluorine
using sol and dip coating to prepare a visible-light-activated antimicrobial
coating.2−4 The silver oxide coatings can also be considered
for application as a top layer antimicrobial coating for orthopedic
implant coatings prepared by magnetron sputtering66 or other preparation methods.

Clinical microbiologists
have observed that bacteria are resistant
to silver in a variety of environments and circumstances.67 The environments include chronic wounds and
burns, dentistry, occupational silver exposure, and water systems.67,68 Evidence of bacterial resistance to silver is provided by mutagenic
changes within the bacterial genome.67 Bacterial
resistance to silver can arise due to intrinsic natural properties
or through DNA mutations in the plasmid and the transposons.67 Silver resistance is also transmissible to susceptible
bacterial strains. Reports in the literature confirmed the prevalence
of epigenetic mechanism during the application of silver nitrate,
silver sulphadiazine, or a silver dressing67 for treatment of wounds indicate that silver ions when present at
a concentration lower than 60 ppm preferably bind to albumins, macroglobulins,
protein cell membranes of the host, and inorganic anions in the microenvironment
and therefore are not available for antimicrobial action.

Silver
ion release both in water and saline conducted during this
research indicated that the concentrations were lower than 60 ppm,
yet Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria could not survive on
the surfaces for more than 25 min, as observed in the antimicrobial
tests conducted. The efficacy of the killing ability in addition to
the silver ion release is attributable to the generation of reactive
oxygen species, as confirmed by XPS analysis, from photocatalysis
and the small sizes of the nanoparticles as evaluated using XRD analysis,
which could freely pass through the pores in the bacterial cell membrane
resulting in attack on the DNA/RNA, proteins, and the cell membrane
simultaneously. This new development in the nanostructured, visible-light-activated
photocatalytic silver oxide biomaterial will certainly reactivate
further interest of clinicians in managing wound infections and other
antimicrobial applications since the multiple and simultaneous attack
caused by the biomaterial does not give the bacteria time to adjust
and initiate resistance when attacked.

4 Summary
and Conclusions
We prepared an optically transparent mixed-phase
but single compound
silver oxide thin film biomaterial through the variation of two deposition
parameters, namely, the oxygen flow rate and forward power, during
reactive magnetron sputter deposition. The undoped silver oxide films
can be activated through photocatalysis since their band gap can be
tuned to be within the visible range of the solar spectrum, by varying
the deposition parameters appropriately. We confirmed the release
of silver ions into water and saline solution when our prepared silver
oxide films were exposed to these environments. The silver oxide films
also displayed antimicrobial properties through rapid bacterial contact
killing. The rate of metal ion release and the relative stability
of any silver complexes can be controlled using variations in the
ligand architecture and the overall structural motif of a silver compound.
We observed that there is a significant statistical difference between
the logs of colony forming units for each of the Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria on the silver oxide-coated substrate compared
to that on the two control surfaces of silver-coated and uncoated
glass substrates used in this investigation over the time periods
considered, implying that the exposure of the microbes to the silver
oxide surfaces has an antimicrobial effect on them.

There was
however no statistically significant difference in the
logs of colony forming units of all four bacteria on the silver oxides
deposited at different forward powers used during reactive magnetron
sputtering, and all of the silver oxide coatings showed an antimicrobial
effect on bacteria exposed to them. The mechanism of antimicrobial
activity of the aqueous silver ions released from our silver oxide
thin film and the rapid killing of microbes are proposed to take place
in three ways, namely, the interference with electron transport, binding
to DNA, and interaction with the cell membrane. The coordination of
donor atoms to the silver(I) center and the ease of ligand replacement
appear to be the key factors leading to a wide spectrum of antimicrobial
activities and to be the primary targets for the inhibition of bacterial
survival and growth. We believe that the above mechanisms are responsible
for the rapid death of bacteria reported in our killing curve investigation
on microbes when they are exposed to silver oxide films. A recent
(2017) investigation by Rtimi et al.69 has
also confirmed the multiple channels of silver–copper ion bacterial
inactivation involving a predominant ionic diffusion route through
cell wall porins and surface-effect-dominated cell wall damage in
genetically modified bacteria that were free from cell wall porins.
The ability of the silver oxide films to also transmit visible light
opens the potential for their application beyond the development of
antimicrobial surfaces in a hospital environment into other areas
like contact lenses and in application areas where both optical transparency
and antimicrobial activity are required.

5 Experimental
Methods
5.1 Deposition of Silver and Silver Oxide Thin
Films
Thin films of silver oxide were deposited using a cryopumped
vacuum chamber by a reactive magnetron sputtering unit. Glass microscope
slides were used as substrates for deposition. The glass slides were
cleaned ultrasonically using isopropyl alcohol and then washed with
deionized water before the deposition of the thin films. A solid silver
target of very high purity supplied by PI-KEM (99.99%) was used for
deposition, while the sputtering and reactive gases were argon and
oxygen, respectively.

5.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
A Hitachi
S4100 field emission scanning electron microscope was used to obtain
the scanning electron microscope micrographs during investigation.

5.3 X-ray Diffraction Analysis
A Siemens
D5000 X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation of wavelength
1.54 nm with Powder Cell software was used for X-ray diffraction analysis.
The 2θ angle was varied between 5 and 155°.

5.4 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy,
using a laser source of wavelength 532 nm at an energy of 2 mW, was
conducted on the deposited samples using a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman
microscope spectrometer interfaced with a computer with OMNIC spectra
software to obtain the Raman spectra of the as-deposited silver oxide
thin films.

5.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy used for this investigation
was performed using a Scientia ESCA300 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)
provided by the National EPSRC User’s Services at the University
of Newcastle Upon Tyne, U.K. The excitation source is Al Kα
with an excitation energy of 1.5 keV and a current of 3 mA. Survey
scans were obtained at 200 eV, while 40 eV pass energy was used for
the high-resolution regions at 120 and 60 s sweep times. Three different
spots of sizes 800 × 400 μm2 were selected and
scanned on each sample. A base pressure of 8 × 10–10 Torr was maintained in the chamber during analysis. Casa XPS software
was used for curve fittings. The background subtraction was conducted
with the Shirley method. The shapes of the Ag 3d5/2 and
Ag 3d3/2 peaks were fitted with a Gaussian (30%)–Lorentzian
(70%) peak function for all of the spectra analyzed.

5.6 Optical Transmittance, Reflectance, and Band
Gap
The optical characterization of the deposited thin films
was performed using an Aquila nkd-8000 spectrophotometer. This facility
simultaneously collects both transmittance and reflectance spectra
using Pro-Optix software. The silver oxides used for this characterization
were deposited on glass slides at varying oxygen flow rates and deposition
powers each at a deposition time of 2 min. The experiments were carried
out in the wavelength range of 350–1100 nm at an incidence
angle of 10° for spectral analysis.

5.7 Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy
Silver
ion release was monitored using an AAnalyst 300 flame atomic absorption
spectrophotometer manufactured by PerkinElmer. All of the operations
of the instrument are computer-controlled through a software. Selected
samples deposited at 100, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 W powers and
a 10 sccm oxygen flow rate were used in the study. Each glass microscope
slide coated with the silver oxide films was cut into four equal portions;
then, an equal amount of either water or saline solution was measured
into bottles and each of the pieces was dropped in the bottles and
sealed. The silver oxide surfaces were removed after 1, 6, 12, or
24 h contact with water and saline solution and used to evaluate silver
ion release.

5.8 Antimicrobial Tests and
Killing Curves for
Microbes
Four microbes were selected for conducting the antimicrobial
tests in this research, namely, E. coli and P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative)
and S. epidermidis and S. aureus (Gram-positive). Overnight bacterial cultures
were grown in Luria broth (LB) media. Ten milliliters of the LB was
pipetted out into sterile bottles into which bacteria were inoculated
using an inoculation loop sterilized by Bunsen flame and shaken at
a speed of 150 rpm at 37 °C overnight. Then, 4.8 g of agar powder
was measured and out into a bottle. Furthermore, 10 g of Luria broth
powder was measured and added into the same bottle containing the
agar. Then, 400 mL of distilled water was used to prepare a solution
after gentle shaking. The bottle and contents were autoclaved at 121
°C for 15 min. The prepared nutrient agar was cooled slightly
to the handling temperature of the plate. The agar was plated in the
Petri dishes and allowed to cool and dry to be ready for culturing
bacteria. The inoculation loop was sterilized using the Bunsen burner
blue flame before and after use. Tips and other containers used during
the preparation of the material and testing were autoclaved at 121
°C for 15 min before further using them.

Silver oxides
were deposited at different conditions of forward power and oxygen
flow rate on glass microscope slides to test their antimicrobial activity.
A pure silver thin film prepared by magnetron sputtering at 300 W
forward power and glass microscope slides, both washed ultrasonically,
were used as control samples.
The bacterial cells were harvested from the overnight culture that
was incubated at 37 °C and suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Then, 10 mL of the cell suspension was pipetted out
into an Eppendorf tube and vortexed after washing twice in PBS. The
optical density of the microbes was measured at 570 nm, and the suspensions
were diluted using PBS to desired values (0.15 for E. coli and 0.2 for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. aeruginosa). Furthermore, 20 μL of the bacterial
suspension was pipetted out and dropped on the silver oxide, silver,
and glass slide surfaces and allowed to interact with the surfaces
for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, and 90 min. After each time interval,
sterile swaps were used to remove the microbes from the surfaces and
added into 1 mL of PBS within 10 s. The microbes were removed from
the swaps by vortexing for 20 s and sonicating for 5 min. A serial
dilution of the bacterial suspension was done using sterile distilled
water, and 50 μL of the desired diluent’s (first, second,
third or fourth, fifth and sixth) of the bacteria were dropped at
three points on each portion of the Petri dishes on which agar has
been prepared. The plated Petri dishes were cultured overnight in
an incubator at 37 °C, and the colony forming units (CFU) were
counted using the Miles and Misra method. The log of CFU was plotted
against time to present the killing curves.

5.9 Statistical
Analysis
The IBM SPSS
statistics software package, version 24 (IBM Corp, New York), was
used for data analysis with the results expressed as mean ± standard
deviation. The microbial colonization on the surfaces is expressed
in terms of the colony forming units (CFU) as log10 CFU
for the four microbes tested. The Student t-test
was used to compare the effects of the variations in the conditions,
i.e., forward power during reactive magnetron sputtering used to prepare
the silver oxide-coated substrate surfaces (p <
0.05) and the microbial colonization over time. A one-way ANOVA test
was used to compare the microbial colonization over time on the silver
oxide-coated substrate surfaces with that on the two control surfaces
of silver-coated and uncoated glass substrates. The post hoc Tukey
test was used to determine the statistical significance of the test
(p < 0.05). The Levene test for equality of variance
was used to determine which data set should be used to interpret the
results obtained in each case.
