Hydrophobically modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (hm-PVA)
films with
various alkyl chain lengths were prepared. Their surface/mechanical
properties, cytocompatibility, and porcine skin adhesion strength
were evaluated. hm-PVAs had 10 °C higher glass transition temperature
than poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (33.4 ± 2.5 °C). The water
contact angle of the hm-PVA films increased with alkyl chain length
and/or hydrophobic group modification ratio. The tensile strength
of the hm-PVA films decreased with increasing alkyl chain length and/or
hydrophobic group modification ratio. hm-PVA with short chain lengths
(4 mol % propanal-modified PVA; 4C3-PVA) had low cytotoxicity compared
with long alkyl chain length hm-PVAs (4 mol % hexanal and nonanal-modified
PVA; 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA). The 4C3-PVA film had the highest porcine
skin adhesion strength. Thus, the 4C3-PVA film is promising as an
adhesive for wearable medical devices.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Wearable sensors are integrated
into soft materials. They directly
contact the body to monitor the health condition and provide clinically
relevant data.1 Most research in this field
has involved testing rigid electronic devices developed by the semiconductor
industry.2 Recently, the research focus
has shifted toward wearable sensing platforms with stretchable and
flexible electronics and excellent mechanical properties. A typical
method of fabricating soft sensors consisted of integrating conducting
material patterns into a stretchable substrate.3−6 However, these materials do not
adhere to skin and must be affixed with commercially available adhesives.

Commercially available acrylic-based medical bandages are currently
used to affix wearable sensors.7 Acrylic-based
adhesives have high adhesion strength. Nevertheless, they may cause
massive exfoliation of the stratum corneum and severe pain.8,9 Moreover, the chemical residues they leave on the skin surface may
induce allergic and inflammatory reactions.10 Pressure-sensitive silicone-based adhesives were developed. They
have a low propensity for inducing exfoliation of the stratum corneum.11,12 On the other hand, their skin retention is weak and they shift easily.13 Furthermore, they are relatively expensive.
Bioinspired skin adhesives with various multiscale architectures were
recently reported. They include patches simulating gecko feet,14,15 microneedles,16 octopus suckers,17 and mussel.18 However,
their fabrication processes are complex and impractical for mass production.

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a hydrophilic, biodegradable, and
biocompatible polymer. It has been widely used in biotechnology and
biomedicine as it has excellent physicochemical properties, is easy
to process, and is highly cytocompatible.19−21 PVA has been
used to fabricate contact lenses, wound dressings, and suture and
catheter coatings.22 It has excellent film-forming
and adhesive properties on soft tissues.23 It is, therefore, biocompatible and non-irritating to skin.24 However, the skin adhesion strength of the PVA
film is low relative to commercial adhesives as it is highly hydrophilic
and water soluble. Various techniques for insolubilizing PVA have
been reported. One method is applying a cross-linking agent to the
hydroxyl groups in PVA.25,26 Another involves serially
freeze-thawing the PVA to form hydrogels with strong hydrogen bonds.27−29 An insoluble PVA film was also produced by modifying a hydrophobic
functional group.30

In our previous
studies, we used hydrophobically modified biopolymers
to prepare surgical sealants,31−33 films,34,35 porous membranes,36 and nanoparticles37 for adhesion to soft biological tissues. Hydrophobic
modification enhances bonding strength even to wet soft tissues. The
most important factors increasing the interfacial strength are the
anchoring effect of the hydrophobic groups to phospholipid membranes38 and enhancement of the interactions between
amphiphilic polymers and extracellular proteins.31 We hypothesized that the hydrophobic modification of PVA
should strengthen its adhesion to soft tissue such as skin. The hydrophobic
group could anchor phospholipid membranes of corneocytes on stratum
corneum and enhance the interactions with keratinocyte lipids (ceramide,
fatty acid, and cholesterol).

Here, we synthesized hydrophobically
modified PVA (hm-PVA) with
various alkyl chain lengths (3, 6, and 9 methylene carbons). We tested
the theory that PVA with alkyl groups will be adhesive. Bonding, shearing,
and peeling of hm-PVA and cell adhesion to hm-PVA films were also
evaluated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of hm-PVAs
The chemical structures of hm-PVAs with various alkyl chain lengths
(C3, C6, and C9) are shown in Figure 1a. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images,
it was indicated that the light transmissive hm-PVA films were flat
(Figure S1). The hm-PVAs were prepared
via the reaction between the hydroxy groups of PVA and aldehydes (Figure 1b) according to a
previously reported procedure.25,39 Under acidic conditions,
aldehydes react with hydroxyl groups by nucleophilic substitution
and rapidly form stable hexagonal ring structures.39Figure 1c shows the 1H NMR spectra for hm-PVAs with different
numbers of methylene carbons. The chemical shifts at 0.85 and 1.26
ppm were assigned to the CH3 and αCH2 protons,
respectively, in the hydrophobic groups of the hm-PVAs. Thus, the
aldehyde groups were successfully introduced into the PVA molecules.
The hm-PVA structure was also analyzed by Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra (Figure 1d). The peak at 2930 cm–1 was attributed to the
C–H stretching vibration of αCH2 in the acetal
groups of the hm-PVAs. Therefore, hm-PVAs with different numbers of
methylene carbons were successfully synthesized. The modification
ratios of the hydrophobic groups (Table 1) were calculated from the 1H
NMR data.

2.2 Glass Transition Temperature of hm-PVAs
The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the hm-PVAs were determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) as previously reported.40 The results
shown in Figure 2b,d
were obtained from the thermal analysis curve (Figure 2a,c). In Figure 2a, Tg is represented
by the intersection of the two dotted lines. In general, Tg of the polymer increases with an increase of molecular
weight.41 The Tg of PVA (Mw = 89 000–98 000;
saponification degree = 99%) is 28.9 °C.40 This result is close to the Tg (33.4
± 2.5 °C) of unmodified PVA (Mw = 88 000; saponification degree > 98.5%) measured in this
study. However, the Tg of PVA (Mw = 115 000; saponification degree =
100%) increases to 80 °C due to higher molecular weight.42 Interestingly, the unmodified PVA had the lowest Tg, whereas the Tg for 4C3-PVA, 4C6-PVA, and 4C9-PVA rose to 47.1 ± 0.3, 45.7
± 2.2, and 44.5 ± 3 °C, respectively (Figure 2b). However, there were no
significant differences among the hm-PVAs of varying alkyl chain lengths
in terms of Tg. In contrast, the Tg of 12C3-PVA and 23C3-PVA were 43.8 ±
0.6 and 51.3 ± 0.7 °C (Figure 2d). The Tg of
the hm-PVAs was 10 °C higher than that of PVA as a consequence
of hydrophobic modification resulting from alkyl chain (C3, C6, and
C9) aggregation. These findings also confirmed the successful integration
of the alkyl groups into the PVA molecules.

temperatures of C3-PVAs with various hydrophobic modification ratios.
Data are mean ± SD (**P < 0.01, n = 3).

2.3 Tensile Strength of hm-PVA Films
Figure 3a shows the
tensile strengths of hm-PVA films with various alkyl chain lengths.
The tensile strengths decreased with increasing alkyl chain length.
The stretching strength of the original PVA film was 105.5 ±
6.7 MPa. The tensile strength of the pure PVA film is reported to
be 40–90 MPa.43,44 These values are lower than the
PVA film used in this study. The reason for this phenomenon is that
PVA (saponification degree > 98.5%) used in this study has a higher
saponification degree compared with previous reports (88–98%).
For the 4C3-PVA film, it was 96.9 ± 4.3 MPa, and the values for
the 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA films were 66.0 ± 7.7 and 51.5 ±
9.8 MPa, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the Young’s
moduli of various films. For the PVA and 4C3-PVA films, the Young’s
moduli were 4.5 ± 0.22 and 4.6 ± 0.56 GPa, respectively.
In contrast, they were 3.7 ± 0.08 and 2.0 ± 0.24 GPa for
the 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA films, respectively. Long alkyl chains in
the PVA molecule inhibit intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Figure 3b shows the ratios
of hydrophobic modification to tensile strength. Here, C3-PVA with
various modification ratios were used as typical hm-PVA films. The
tensile strengths of the C3-PVA films decreased with increasing hydrophobic
modification ratio. Relative to the 4C3-PVA film, the tensile strengths
of the 12C3-PVA and 23C3-PVA films were much lower (47.4 ± 1.6
and 24.3 ± 2.1 MPa, respectively). A similar trend was observed
for the Young’s moduli of the C3-PVA films with various hydrophobic
modification ratios. The Young’s moduli for 4C3-PVA, 12C3-PVA,
and 23C3-PVA were 4.6 ± 0.56, 2.5 ± 0.09, and 1.8 ±
0.04 GPa, respectively. Higher hydrophobic modification ratios inhibit
intermolecular hydrogen bonding in C3-PVA.

lengths. (b) Tensile strengths of C3-PVAs films with various hydrophobic
modification ratios. (c) WCAs of hm-PVA films with different alkyl
chain lengths. (d) WCAs of C3-PVAs films with various hydrophobic
modification ratios. Data are mean ± SD (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n =
3).

2.4 Surface Wettability of hm-PVA Films
The surface wettability of the films differs between the side exposed
to air and that in contact with the substrate.45 Here, we measured the WCA of hm-PVA films exposed to the
air. Figure 3c shows
the WCA of hm-PVA films with various alkyl chain lengths and modification
ratios. The WCA for the original PVA film was lower (59.4 ± 6.8°)
than those of the hm-PVA films with different alkyl chain lengths
(62.8 ± 4.9–83.3 ± 0.6°). The WCA of the hm-PVA
films increased with alkyl chain length. The longer alkyl chains incorporated
in the PVA molecule integrated on the surfaces of the hm-PVA films. Figure 3d shows that the
WCA of the hm-PVA films increased with the hydrophobic modification
ratio. Film surface hydrophobicity increases with the number of alkyl
groups introduced into the PVA molecule.

2.5 Cytocompatibility of hm-PVAs
To evaluate
hm-PVA cytocompatibility, NHDF cells were cultured under various concentrations
of hm-PVAs. Figure 4 shows cell viability and conditions after 24 h incubation. Figure 4a indicates that
the NHDF cells spread over the tissue culture polystyrene surfaces.
Cell density decreased with increasing hm-PVA concentration. However,
the morphology of the surviving cells did not change. Figure 4b shows cell viability at various
hm-PVA concentrations. NHDF cell viability was over 80% in medium
with low (0.1 mg mL–1) concentrations of all hm-PVAs
except 4C3-PVA. Cell viability decreased with increasing hm-PVA concentration.
In contrast, NHDF viability was highest at all 4C3-PVA concentrations
(0.1–10 mg mL–1). The hm-PVAs with comparatively
longer side chains (4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA) were more toxic than that
those with no or shorter side chains (PVA and 4C3-PVA). Thus, 4C3-PVA
is relatively nontoxic to skin cells.

2.6 Adhesion Test of hm-PVA on Porcine Skin
We determined the adhesive properties of hm-PVA films by measuring
bonding, lap-shear, and T-peel strength. Bonding strength was evaluated
according to ASTM F2258-05 (Figure 5a). Figure 5b shows the force–distance curve used to calculate
bonding strength. Bonding energy of the hm-PVA films on porcine skin
was calculated from the area under the force–distance curve
(Figure 5b). The bonding
energy of the 4C3-PVA film (5.50 ± 1.45 J m–2) was nearly five times higher than that of the original PVA film
(1.10 ± 0.23 J m–2) (Figure 5c). The 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA have longer side
chains than those of 4C3-PVA. Nevertheless, the bonding energies of
the 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA films were 1.94 ± 0.46 and 1.09 ±
0.15 J m–2, respectively, which were closer to that
for PVA. The 4C3-PVA film had high wettability and penetrated the
gap on the skin surface. Moreover, the tensile strength of the 4C3-PVA
film was as strong as that of the original PVA film. Thus, the 4C3-PVA
film also had high bulk strength. This property substantially enhances
the adhesion of the film to the surface. The modified alkyl groups
(C3) readily anchored to the skin cell membranes and had strong interfacial
adhesion. However, interfacial peeling occurred between the porcine
skin surface and the PVA film as the latter has no alkyl side chains.
The 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA films were anchored by their alkyl groups
to the surfaces. Nevertheless, they had low adhesion strength as their
wettability was weak and their skin surface gap penetration was poor.

(*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n = 3).

Figure 5d–f
shows the effects of alkyl chain length on hm-PVAs lap-shear strength.
This parameter was measured according to ASTM F2255-05 (Figure 5d). Figure 6e shows the force–distance curve for
the lap-shear strength measurement. Figure 5f shows the lap-shear strengths of the hm-PVA
films on porcine skin. These values were calculated from the force–distance
curve (Figure 5e).
The results indicated that hydrophobic modification enhanced lap-shear
strength. The lap-shear strength of the 4C3-PVA film was 2.53 ±
0.71 kPa which was over two times higher than that of the original
PVA film (1.12 ± 0.10 kPa). However, the lap-shear strengths
of the 4C6- and 4C9-PVA films were comparatively lower than that of
4C3-PVA (2.24 ± 0.17 and 1.72 ± 0.21 kPa, respectively).
The anchor effect of the alkyl groups (C3, C6, and C9) drew the hm-PVA
films into close contact with the porcine skin surface. Thus, the
hm-PVA films had significantly greater resistance to transverse stress
than the original PVA film.

Figure 6 (a) Bonding strength measurements for hm-PVA
films (scale bar =
5 mm). (b) Histology of the hm-PVA film-porcine skin interface after
bonding strength measurement. The yellow arrow indicates stratum corneum
exfoliation site (scale bar = 100 μm).

Figure 5g–i
shows the T-peel strength of hm-PVAs after adhesion to porcine skin
according to ASTM F2256-05. Figure 5h shows the force–displacement curve for the
T-peel strength measurement. The T-peel strengths of the hm-PVA films
on porcine skin were calculated from this curve (Figure 5h). The T-peel strength of
4C3-PVA film was 10.4 ± 1.4 N m–1 which was
nearly twice that of the original PVA (5.6 ± 1.5 N m–1). However, the peeling force decreased with increasing alkyl chain
length. The values for the C6-PVA and the C9-PVA were 9.1 ± 0.7
and 8.4 ± 1.9 N m–1, respectively. Figure 3c indicates that
film surface wettability increases with decreasing alkyl chain length.
Enhancement of the peeling strength is determined by the balance between
surface wettability and alkyl chain anchoring.

Figure 5j–l
shows the influences of the hydrophobic modification ratio on the
bonding and lap-shear strength. Bonding strength decreased with the
increasing hydrophobic modification ratio because of low wettability
(Figure 5k). Moreover,
shearing strength decreased with the increasing hydrophobic modification
ratio because of weak hydrogen interactions among hm-PVA molecules
(Figure 5l).

Debonding occurred after the hm-PVA films were applied to porcine
skin. Figure 6a shows
that the PVA film peeled off the entire porcine skin surface. Therefore,
interfacial adhesion between the original PVA film and the skin tissue
is weak. In contrast, the 4C3-PVA film strongly adhered to the upper
and lower skin surfaces. Thus, the alkyl groups (C3) of 4C3-PVA were
well anchored to the stratum corneum of the porcine skin. Peeling
of the 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA films from the film–skin interfaces
increased with the hydrophobic modification ratio. The 4C6-PVA and
4C9-PVA films had low wettability and, by extension, poor affinity
for the porcine skin. Figure 6b shows the histology of the hm-PVA film-porcine skin interface
after bonding strength measurement. No stratum corneum exfoliation
was observed on either tissue surface when the original PVA film was
applied. Thus, interfacial adhesion between the PVA film and the skin
was quite weak. High stratum corneum exfoliation rates were confirmed
for both skin surfaces when the 4C3-PVA film was applied to them.
Therefore, this type of film adhered strongly to porcine skin. This
finding was consistent with Figures 6c and 7. For the 4C6-PVA and
4C9-PVA films, there was partial stratum corneum exfoliation. For
this reason, adhesion and penetration of these materials on porcine
skin were lower than those for 4C3-PVA. These findings are consistent
with those shown in Figure 6a.

Figure 7 Bonding strength mechanism of hm-PVA films adhering to porcine
skin.

Based on the foregoing results, we proposed a bonding
mechanism
for hm-PVA films on porcine skin and illustrated it in Figure 7. During bonding, the PVA and
4C3-PVA films readily penetrate the gap on the skin surface. However,
the 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA films have low wettability and their penetration
in the skin surface is weak. The alkyl groups (C3, C6, and C9) easily
anchor to the stratum corneum. The 4C3-PVA film has a large contact
surface and numerous alkyl group anchor points. After measuring the
bonding strengths, we determined that the PVA film readily peels off
the skin surface and causes no stratum corneum exfoliation as it lacks
an anchor effect. In contrast, the 4C3-PVA film tightly adheres to
the skin surface and induces stratum corneum exfoliation as it has
a strong alkyl group anchor effect. However, the 4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA
films partially peel off the skin surface and promote relatively little
stratum corneum exfoliation as they have low wettability.

3 Conclusions
We prepared hm-PVA films
and evaluated their surface properties,
mechanical strength, and adhesion to porcine skin by measuring their
bonding, lap-shear, and T-peel strengths according to ASTM methods.
We assessed the cytocompatibility of hm-PVAs in physical contact with
skin cells. The water contact angles (WCAs) of the hm-PVA films increased
with alkyl chain length and/or alkyl group modification ratio. The
tensile strengths of the hm-PVA films decreased with increasing alkyl
chain length and/or alkyl group modification ratio. The 4C3-PVA film
showed excellent cytocompatibility compared to other hm-PVAs with
long alkyl chain lengths (4C6-PVA and 4C9-PVA). When it was applied
to porcine skin, it exhibited the highest bonding/lap-shear/T-peel
strengths. Therefore, 4C3-PVA film may be an effective adhesive or
bonding material for wearable medical devices.

4.2 Synthesis of hm-PVA
The hm-PVAs were
prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction between aldehydes and
the PVA hydroxyl groups following a previously reported procedure.25,39 PVA (10 g) was dissolved in 98 mL H2O at 80 °C for
60 min. Then, 100 mL DMSO and 2 mL of 1 N HCl were added to the solution
to form a 200 mL solution comprising 5% (w/v) PVA and 1% (v/v) 1 N
HCl. Various amounts of aldehyde groups (C3, C6, and C9) were added
to the solution, and the mixtures were stirred at 50 °C for 1
h. A reflux condenser was used in all processes. The hm-PVA [H2O/DMSO = 50/50 (v/v)] product was added to 600 mL cold ethanol,
and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The precipitated hm-PVAs were
washed at least thrice with 300 mL EtOH to remove any unreacted aldehyde
and DMSO. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to obtain purified
white hm-PVAs crystals which were then finely ground in a mill (Wonder
Crusher WC-3; Osaka Chemical, Osaka, Japan).

4.3 Characterization of hm-PVAs
The chemical
structures of the hm-PVAs were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectroscopy (AL300; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
using a 0.5% (w/v) hm-PVA/DMSO-d6 solution
at 25 °C. Each sample was scanned eight times. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR; 8400S, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan)
was conducted to confirm the presence of acetal groups in the hm-PVAs.
The scan range was 700–4000 cm–1, and each
sample was scanned 64 times. The hydrophobic group modification ratios
of the hm-PVAs were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The modification ratios were calculated as follows 1  where the integral area (αCH proton)
is the area of the peak at 3.87 ppm, corresponding to the αCH
proton in the PVA and hm-PVA backbones, and the integral area (CH3 proton) is the area of the peak at 0.85 ppm assigned to the
CH3 proton in the hydrophobic groups of the hm-PVAs.

4.4 Glass Transition Temperature of hm-PVAs
In this study, PVA and hm-PVAs powders were dried at 40 °C
under vacuum for 24 h before DSC measurement. The glass transition
temperatures (Tg) of the hm-PVAs were
determined by DSC based on the technical standards established by
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E1356-03.40 Briefly, approximately 15 mg of each hm-PVA
was placed in an aluminum pan and sealed with an autosealer. Thermograms
were recorded in the range of −50 to 100 °C by DSC (Thermo
Plus EVO 8230; Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at a heating rate
of 10 °C min–1 under a N2 atmosphere.

4.5 Preparation of hm-PVA Films
hm-PVAs
were dissolved in 40% (v/v) aqueous EtOH to obtain a 1% (w/v) solution.
The hm-PVA solutions were then poured into silicone molds of 1 mm
thick. These were dried on a clean bench (As One, Osaka, Japan) at
25 °C overnight. The dry hm-PVA films were peeled off from the
silicone sheets. Surface morphology was observed by SEM (S4800, Hitachi
Co., Tokyo, Japan). The thickness of hm-PVA films was measured with
a coolant proof micrometer (MDC-MX, Mitutoyo Corporation, Kanagawa,
Japan). The average thickness of each film was shown in Table 2.

4C6-PVA	13.4 ± 1.3	
4C9-PVA	13.6 ± 1.9	
4.6 Tensile Strength of hm-PVA Films
The tensile strengths of the hm-PVA films were determined according
to the Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) K 7161. Briefly, hm-PVA
films (thickness was mentioned in Table 2) were cut into standard rectangles 150 mm
long and 15 mm wide. The tensile strengths of the hm-PVA films were
measures with a texture analyzer (TA-XT2i; Stable Micro Systems, Godalming,
UK) at a tracking speed of 5 mm min–1.

4.7 Surface Wettability Measurement of hm-PVA
Films
The WCAs of the hm-PVA films were measured with a contact
angle meter (sessile drop method) (CAM; DM700; Kyowa Interface Science,
Saitama, Japan). The hm-PVA films were placed on a glass sheet and
deionized water was added to them dropwise to evaluate their water
wettability.

4.8 Cytocompatibility Test of hm-PVAs
NHDFs were cultured in Medium 106 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) supplemented with 10% (w/v) LSGS (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St.
Louis, MO, USA) under standard cell culture conditions (sterility;
37 °C; humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere). One hundred
microliter culture medium containing 5 × 103 NHDF
cells was placed in each well of 96-well plates and incubated for
24 h to ensure cell adhesion to the polystyrene surface. The culture
medium in each well was then removed. Then, 100 μL culture medium
aliquots containing various hm-PVA concentrations were added to each
well. After incubation for an additional 24 h, 10 μL cell count
reagent (WST-8) was added to each well followed by incubation for
2 h. The absorbances of the well contents were measured at 450 nm
in a microplate reader (Spark10M; Tecan, Osaka, Japan). All operations
were conducted on a clean bench (As One, Osaka, Japan). The actin
cytoskeletons of the NHDF cells were stained with phalloidin–tetramethyl
rhodamine B isothiocyanate peptide, and their nuclei were stained
with DAPI. Briefly, the media was removed and the wells were washed
with PBS solution. Then, 100 μL of fresh fixative solution (4%
(v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS) was added to each well and the cells
were fixed at room temperature for 15 min. The fixative solution was
then removed, and the wells were washed with PBS. Then, 0.2% (v/v)
Triton X-100 solution was added to each well and left for 10 min at
room temperature. The Triton X-100 was then removed by washing thrice
with PBS. Blocking solution [1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS] was added to each well and left for 1 h. After removing the blocking
solution, 400 μL of phalloidin–tetramethyl rhodamine
B isothiocyanate peptide in 1% (v/v) BSA (1:100 dilution) was added
to each well and left for 1 h. Each well was then washed at least
thrice with PBS. DAPI in PBS (1:100 dilution) was added to each well,
left for 10 min, and washed thrice with PBS. The stained cells were
then observed under an inverted fluorescence phase contrast microscope
(BZ-X700; Keyence Co., Tokyo, Japan).

4.9 Bonding Strength Measurement of the hm-PVA
Films
Bonding strengths of the hm-PVA films on porcine skin
were determined according to ASTM F2258-05. Briefly, porcine skin
was cut into 25 mm × 25 mm squares and placed on the surface
of a heater set to 37 °C. A sterile cotton surgical gauze was
used to remove excess moisture from the skin surfaces. The hm-PVA
films (thickness was mentioned in Table 2, 25 mm × 25 mm) were applied to the
skin, and 50 μL of 40% (v/v) EtOH was dropped on the film surfaces
to induce them to swell. The bonding energy of hm-PVA films was measured
by the texture analyzer (TA-XT2i; Stable Micro Systems, Godalming,
UK) at 2 N applied force, 3 min waiting time, and 10 mm min–1 tracking speed.

To elucidate the adhesion mechanism, a cross-section
of the porcine skin was observed after the bonding test. It was fixed
in 10% (v/v) formalin neutral buffer solution, stained with hematoxylin
and eosin, and examined under an inverted fluorescence phase contrast
microscope (BZ-X700; Keyence Co., Tokyo, Japan).

4.10 Lap-Shear Strength Measurement of hm-PVA
Films
The lap-shear strengths of the hm-PVA films were evaluated
according to ASTM F2255-05. Briefly, porcine skin was cut into 50
mm × 25 mm rectangles and placed on the surface of the heater
set to 37 °C. A sterile cotton surgical gauze was used to remove
excess moisture from the skin surfaces. The hm-PVA films (thickness
was mentioned in Table 2, length is 25 mm, and width is 10 mm) were applied to skin rectangles.
Then, 20 μL of 40% (v/v) EtOH was dropped on the film surface
and other pieces of skin were superimposed on them. A 200 g weight
was placed on each composition and left there at 37 °C for 3
min. The lap-shear strengths of the hm-PVA films were measured by
the texture analyzer at 5 mm min–1 tracking speed.

4.11 T-Peel Strength Measurement
The
T-peel strengths of the hm-PVA films on porcine skin were determined
according to ASTM F2256-05. Briefly, porcine skin was cut into 150
mm × 15 mm rectangles and excess moisture was removed from them
with a mesh. The hm-PVA films were applied to the skin rectangles,
and 40% (v/v) EtOH was sprayed onto them. After drying at 25 °C
for 1 h, the peeling strengths of the hm-PVA films (thickness was
mentioned in Table 2, 150 mm × 15 mm) were established by the texture analyzer at
200 mm min–1 tracking speed. The average values
of the peeling force were calculated over a 40–100 mm displacement
range.

4.12 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was carried out using the Tukey–Kramer test with KyPlot
software. Statistically significant differences were accepted when p < 0.05. Data are presented as means ± standard
deviations (SD).
