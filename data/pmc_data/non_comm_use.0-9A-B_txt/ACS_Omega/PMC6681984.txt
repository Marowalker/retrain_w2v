Biowaxes synthesized
from vegetable fatty acids are an alternative
to petrochemical paraffins. A simple way of access to these compounds
involves Fisher-type esterification of long-chain acids and alcohols
under acidic conditions, but long reaction times and harsh conditions
are commonly required. In this study, for the first time in the literature,
biowax esters are prepared under flow conditions cutting dramatically
both reaction times (from 12 h to 30 min) and temperature conditions,
with respect to batch procedures (from 90–120 °C to 55
°C). This approach brings substantial improvements to the biowax
synthesis process from an economic and environmental point of view,
thus making the method up-scalable to the industrial level.

Introduction
The term “wax”
concerns to naturally solids and amorphous
substances at room temperature that become liquid quite easily around
50 °C. The waxes are essentially based on alkanes C20–C30
and represent the 70% of the market.1 These
waxes can also be obtained through industrial synthetic processes;
for example, polyethylene waxes, which are made by low molecular weight
chains (Mn less than 10,000 Da), are prepared
by either high-pressure or by Zeigler-type polymerization,2 while Fischer–Tropsch wax is produced
by carbon monoxide polymerization under high pressure.3 Waxes are usually employed as component in lubricants,
adhesives, foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceutics.4

In recent years, the focus has raised to the study
of bio-based
waxes obtained essentially from the structural modification of triglycerides
of vegetable oils5 carried out by partial
or full hydrogenation of fatty acid chains or by interesterification
to achieve the desired physical properties.4,6 Several
functional groups are commonly introduced on the acyl chains to improve
cohesiveness and tune the wax physicochemical properties, such as
hydroxyl or branched alkyl groups and short-chain fatty acids.7,8 Another possible approach to prepare biowaxes is the direct esterification
of long-chain acids with fatty alcohols4 to produce wax esters with chains longer than C30 that are normally
harder, less greasy, and more brittle than those obtained by the abovementioned
transesterification processes.6,9

These waxes are
commonly achieved with numerous homogenous catalysts,4,10−12 mainly Brønsted acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid13 and H2SO4,14 that are difficult to
be removed, thus creating environmental problems such as the large
amount of waste generated and reactor corrosion.15,16 In addition, other severe limitations such as high temperatures
and long reaction times are associated with these processes. Ionic
liquid17 and enzymes18 are also used as catalysts in these direct esterifications.

Likewise, a number of heterogeneous catalysts have been used for
wax ester synthesis, for example, Amberlyst-15,6 porous meso carbon,16 and sulfated
zirconia,19 getting the undoubted advantages
of facile catalyst recovery and reduced waste production, but also
in these cases, temperatures over 100 °C and long reaction times
were necessary to achieve satisfactory conversions.

In recent
years, flow chemistry has rapidly gained interest due
to the numerous improvements introduced in synthetic processes such
as automation, safe reproducibility, improved safety, and process
reliability.20−22 Additionally, reaction parameters settled for laboratory-scale
fluidic processes can be used in the up-scaled flow reactors without
the need for special optimization procedures.23

Several studies concerning the preparation of vegetable oil
derivatives
under continuous flow conditions have been reported, for example,
the epoxidation of soybean oil,24 the transesterification
to biodiesel,25 and the glycerol oligomerization.26

In our efforts aimed at developing green
synthetic procedures using
green catalysts27 and natural compounds,28−30 we recently reported the application of the fluidic approach to
the oxirane ring opening of epoxidized soybean oil with methanol,31 which improved the analogous process conducted
in batch in terms of TONs (turnover number), solvent consumption,
and reaction times. Following these successful results, we decided
to extend the continuous flow strategy to the esterification reaction
of fatty acids with long-chain alcohols to prepare biowax esters (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Synthesis
of Biowaxes with the Esterification Reaction
With the goal of obtaining a suitable method for industrial
applications,
we have developed herein, unprecedented in the literature, the flow
chemistry procedure for the esterification of margaric, stearic, oleic,
and palmitic acids with an array of alcohols to produce the corresponding
ester waxes.4,6,18,32 Optimization of reaction conditions has
been performed by response surface methodology (RSM).

Results and Discussion
Fisher-type esterification of margaric acid (1) with
stearyl alcohol (2) to octadecyl heptadecanoate (3) (wax C35) was chosen as the model reaction. This wax ester
has received little attention until now, being still prepared with
an old procedure,32 which starts from acyl
chloride and alcohol in the presence of quinoline, thus generating
large amounts of by-products. Direct esterification can be the solution
to the waste formation, and flow chemistry can be used to circumvent
the problem of low reactivity of the carboxyl group.

Based on
a known procedure with an heterogeneous acid catalyst,6 a series of preliminary experiments, carried
out in a batch mode, enabled us to set the starting conditions to
be used in the flow mode statistical optimization (see Experimental Section): acid–alcohol equal to 1.1:1
molar ratio, catalyst loading (CH3SO3H) 5% (w/w
with respect to acid), temperature of 95 °C, and reaction time
of 12 h. The wax (3) product showed the identical physicochemical
features as those described in the literature.32

Optimization of Esterification Parameters with the DOE Method
The three reaction factors (temperature, residence time, and wt
% of catalyst) were optimized by means of 15 experiments as statistically
required by the Box–Behnken design (Table 1). Based on instrumental limits and literature
evidences,4,6 the ranges of 55–95 °C (for T), 30–90 min (for RT), and 5–10% (for wt
% of catalyst) were chosen for applying the DOE method.

a Reaction conditions as reported
in Experimental Section.

Based on literature evidences, CHCl3 was used as the
solvent.4,10,12 In addition,
the acid–alcohol ratio was excluded from the statistical treatment.
Indeed, this factor has been already explored in reactions conducted
in batch,4 with ratios ranging from equimolar
amounts, for example, used with sulfonic-based heterogeneous catalysts
(Amberlyst),6 to large excesses of carboxylic
acid (5.10:1).14 Being the conditions adopted
in this work, more similar to the former case, with methane sulfonic
acid used as the catalyst, a quite similar acid–alcohol molar
ratio (1.1:1) was chosen for carrying the DOE method.

Statistical
Analysis of Experimental Design
Table 2 reports the analysis
by the ANOVA method of the experiments described in Table 1 to evaluate the “grade
of fitting”. From statistical parameters obtained, it clearly
emerged that parameters B, C, BC, and CC (reported in bold) are statistically
significant at a confidence level of 95% (since they have a P-value less than 0.05). Therefore, the ANOVA table shows
that the significant variables affecting the response are the residence
time, amount of catalyst, and their interaction.

Due to the high P-values (greater than 0.05),
parameters such as temperature, interaction temperature–residence
time, interaction temperature–catalyst, and quadratic terms
of temperature and residence time were not found to be significant.

The effects of each factor can be visualized graphically in Figure 1 where the reaction
time clearly emerged as a crucial parameter that affected dramatically
reaction yields, showing a highly negative slope. Indeed, when the
time was prolonged to 90 min, yield of 3 dropped drastically
to 31% (run 3, Table 1), thus indicating that for long time reverse reaction of hydrolysis
becomes predominant, similarly to what reported in the literature
for the synthesis of methyl laurate.33

Figure 1 Main effect plots
for reaction yield.

Two control experiments
were carried out to ascertain this assumption,
conducting reactions under optimized conditions of temperature (55
°C) and wt % of catalyst (9.54%) and monitoring conversions at
60 and 90 min.

As expected, the starting stearyl alcohol increased
with prolonged
times while simultaneously decreased the wax C35 (3)
yield. A different mode way of depicting the influence of the three
variables studied and their mutual influence was given by the Pareto
chart (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Standardized Pareto
chart.

Using Statgraphics Centurion XVII
software, a quadratic model was
found to be appropriate for accounting experimental results in agreement
with the following equation (R2 = 0.944595):  

The software also provided the response surface graph according
to the quadratic model, together with the optimized parameters (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Response
surface graph and optimized parameters.

As the temperature did not have a significant effect in the
range
studied, for the successive experiments, the lowest value of 55 °C
was employed. To validate results obtained with the DOE method, a
control experiment was performed using the optimized parameters of
temperature, 55 °C; residence time, 30 min; and wt % of catalyst,
9.54%. Reaction yield obtained under these conditions was 80 ±
1%. On the other hand, when these conditions were applied in a batch
mode, a yield of 17 ± 1% was obtained.

Substrate Scope
After achieving the optimal reaction
conditions, a substrate scope was conducted for preparing, for the
first time under flow conditions, biowax esters 3–8 coming from margaric, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids
and an array of alcohols.

Results in Table 3 show from good to excellent yields in the
range of 67–92%, with the sole exception of 4-hydroxybutyl
stearate 5 (run 3), which was obtained in modest yield
probably due to the higher polarity of the starting diol.

c Selectivity was found to be 100%

d Acid–alcohol
= 2:1 molar
ratio.

To verify this latter
hypothesis, 1,4-butanediol was replaced with
the less polar monoalcohol having the same alkyl chain 1-butanol,
thus obtaining the corresponding n-butyl stearate
(6) with a 68% of isolated yield, demonstrating that
the high polarity of starting materials represents a limit for this
protocol (run 4).

Further evidences on the influence of polarity
came from the reaction
of diol with excess amounts of stearic acid where the exclusive formation
of diester 5′ was detected, again in modest yield
(40%), but without any trace of monoester 5 (run 5).
In this case, monoester 5 intermediate, once formed,
competes favorably with the less soluble butanediol for carboxylic
acid, thus shifting reaction completely toward the formation of diester.

Both stearyl stearate (4) and 4-hydroxybutyl stearate
(5) (Table 3, runs 1 and 2) are useful waxes employed for producing corrugated
coatings.6

They are prepared in higher
yields in a batch mode but require
very long reaction times and higher temperatures, thus rendering a
less sustainable esterification process.6,11,34−37

Dodecyl palmitate (7) and n-octyl
oleate (8), suitable compounds for the formulation of
cosmetics,18 were obtained in high yields
under flow conditions (Table 3, runs 4 and5), thus making this method more convenient than
the previously reported processes based on biocatalysts (lipase),38,39 scCO2 as the reaction medium,40 and organocatalysts
supported on N-doped graphene oxide.41 Most
of these latter procedures are not useful for industrial applications
because of the high cost of catalysts or the hard experimental condition
requirements.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the replacement
of the batch process with continuous
flow synthesis in the preparation of wax esters from long-chain alcohols
and fatty acids resulted in a remarkable process improvement. Compared
with the batch reaction, the flow mode enabled (i) to cut the reaction
time from 12 h to 30 min, (ii) to lower temperature (55 °C) with
respect to literature procedures (90–120 °C), and (iii)
to reduce quantities of solvent (half amounts with respect to the
batch mode). All these milder conditions brought significant benefits
in terms of energy consumption, cost efficiency, and ecosustainability.
Notably, when flow conditions were applied to the batch mode synthesis
of waxes 3–7, reaction yields did
not exceed 20%.

All these benefits indicate that this new procedure
of biowax ester
synthesis, which has no precedent in the literature, has a good potential
for industrial applications.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
A Vapourtec R-series flow reactor
was used in the synthesis of biowaxes. The reactor consists of a 10
mL PFA tube, inserted inside a quartz enclosure and wrapped in spire,
for temperature monitoring. The “reagent in” port of
the reactor coil was connected to the pump with a length of PFA tubing.
The “reagent out” port was then directly interfaced
with an 8 bar back pressure regulator after which there is a PFA tube
connected to a collection vial. The instrument has several digital
control displays for physical parameters, such as the residence time
(flow rate) and temperature.

In particular, the residence time
can be varied from 2 to 200 min, while the temperature can be controlled
in the range of room temperature to 150 °C.

NMR spectra
were recorded on an Agilent Technologies 500 MHz spectrometer;
the 1H resonance signals were referenced to residual isotopic
impurity of CDCl3 (7.26 ppm). The 13C resonance
signals were referenced to residual isotopic impurity of CDCl3 (77.00 ppm). GC–MS experiments were run on a Shimadzu
GLC 17-A instrument connected with a Shimadzu QP5050A selective mass
detector using an SLB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; film thickness,
0.25 μm). Mass spectra were performed in an EI mode (70 eV).
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a Shimadzu
LCMS-IT-TOF instrument with the following settings: mass range 50–1000 m/z, ionization system electrospray ion
source in the positive ion mode, nebulizer gas nitrogen at 1.5 L/min,
dry gas nitrogen at 1.2 MPa, and collision gas argon at 250 °C.

General Batch Mode Synthesis of Wax C35 Octadecyl Heptadecanoate
(3)
Preparation of 3 was performed
according to an analogous procedure for the synthesis of wax esters:6 in a 25 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a
condenser, 110 mg of margaric acid (0.407 mmol), 100 mg of stearyl
alcohol (0.369 mmol), and 3.72 μL of methanesulfonic acid as
the catalyst (d = 1.48 g/mL; 0.057 mmol) were dissolved
in 5 mL of chloroform and heated under stirring at 95 °C for
12 h. The reaction progress was monitored by GC–MS analysis.
Next, the reaction mixture was washed consecutively with aqueous solutions
of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 to remove the
excess of heptadecanoic acid and the catalyst and finally washed with
deionized water until neutrality. Then, the organic phase was dried,
and the solvent CHCl3 was evaporated under vacuum. The
crude ester was recrystallized from ethanol affording 68 mg (70%)
of octadecyl heptadecanoate (3) in high purity (mp 60–63
°C, lit. 61.1 °C32). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 4.05 (t, J = 6.5 Hz, 2H), 2.28 (t, J = 7.5, 2H), 1.61 (broad
m, 2H), 1.25 (m, 58H), 0.88 (t, J = 7.0, 6H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz): δ 174.0, 64.4, 34.4,
31.9, 30.9, 29.7, 29.6, 29.5, 29.4, 29.3, 29.1, 28.6, 25.9, 25.0,
22.7, 14.1. GC–MS (EI) (70 eV) m/z (%): 522 (M+, 29), 271 (100), 57 (43) 43 (40). HRMS (ESI-TOF) m/z [M + Na]+: calcd for C35H70NaO2+: 545.5284; found,
545.5224.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Wax C35 (3) in Flow Conditions
Two milliliters of a chloroform solution
of margaric acid (14.8 mg, 0.054 mmol) was injected in the loop A
(Scheme 2), and 2 mL
of a chloroform solution of stearyl alcohol (13.4 mg, 0.049 mmol)
and methanesulfonic acid (1.0 μL, 10 wt %) were injected in
the loop B. Both bottles were labeled as S contained chloroform, which
is the solvent of the reaction. Two pumps were charged using the start-up
sequence suggested from the equipment manufacturer. Initially, chloroform
was pumped inside the reactor heated to 55 °C at a flow rate
of 0.5 mL/min. Then, by means of switches on the unit, both the reagent
in loop A and loop B were flowed simultaneously at a flow rate of
0.334 mL/min, which corresponds to a calculated residence time of
30 min. When the reagents had been processed from the loops, the flow
was switched back from loops to solvent, and the reaction product,
obtained at the exit of the reactor coil, was extracted with the same
procedure adopted in the batch mode.

Scheme 2 Representative Scheme
of the Continuous Flow Reactor
Experimental Design and Data Analysis
The three specific
reaction parameters “temperature, residence time, and wt %
of catalyst” were studied through the experimental optimization
design (DOE) method, applying the Box–Behnken design elaborated
by Statgraphics Centurion XVII software. Fifteen experiments were
carried out in order to study the effects of three factors (reported
in Table 1). The runs
were conducted in a single block, and the order of the experiments
was completely randomized to eliminate the effects of latent variables.
DOE allows evaluating the influence of the temperature, residence
time, and amount of catalyst and any interaction between the factors,
according to a quadratic polynomial model with a general formula  where x1, x2, and x3 are the
experimental variables (T, RT, and wt % of catalyst,
respectively), while β0, β1, β2, β3, β12, β23, β13, β11, β22, and β33 are the coefficients of the polynomial
model, and Y is the response (reaction yield).
