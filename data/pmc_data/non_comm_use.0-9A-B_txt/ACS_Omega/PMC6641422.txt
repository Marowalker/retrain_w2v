Nitrosocarbonyl
intermediates, generated at room temperature by
oxidation of nitrile oxides, undergo clean ene reactions with trisubstituted
cycloalkenes. Nitrosocarbonyl benzene follows a Markovnikov orientation
and abstracts preferentially the twix hydrogens over the lone ones.
With the more sterically demanding nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene in the
presence of 5- and 6-membered ring olefins, the Markovnikov directing
effect is relieved, and twix and lone abstractions are observed. Endocyclic
allylic hydrogens on the more congested side of the alkene are exclusively
abstracted (the “cis effect”) resembling the singlet
oxygen behavior. The balance between steric and conformational factors,
as well as the acylnitroso generation conditions, dictates the regioselectivity
in some cases. Larger ring olefins undergo selective twix allylic
hydrogen abstraction. The photochemical generation of nitrosocarbonyl
is totally selective according to the Markovnikov orientation. The
synthetic utility of the ene compounds is also accounted.

Introduction
Nitrosocarbonyls 1 (RCONO) are highly reactive intermediates
discovered by Kirby and traditionally generated by periodate oxidation
of hydroxamic acids 2.1 Alternative
methods for their generation have been recently proposed and reviewed,1b where the hydroxamic acids (R-CONHOH) can be
easily oxidized with air or oxygen and Cu(II) metal catalyst in the
presence of a 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline ligand or with a photoredox catalyst
such as the inexpensive and common Rose Bengal.2 Moreover and in particular, the mild oxidation of nitrile
oxides 3 with tertiary amine N-oxides
easily leads to a variety of aromatic and aliphatic nitrosocarbonyls.3 The generated intermediates can be efficiently
trapped with dienes to afford the corresponding hetero-Diels–Alder
(HDA) cycloadducts 4 in very good yields (60–80%)
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Generation
and Trapping Methods of Nitrosocarbonyl Intermediates1b,2
Nitrosocarbonyls 1 also behave as “superenophiles”
in ene processes with a variety of olefins affording the ene adducts 5.4 Periodate oxidative conditions
are detrimental for ene adducts, but these reaction products are stable
under the milder oxidation of nitrile oxides and were obtained in
excellent yields (up to 99%) with tri- and tetra-substituted olefins.5 With less substituted ethylenes, which display
some 1,3-dipolarophilic activity, the ene route is still active, but
mixtures of cycloadducts and ene products are formed. To escape from
this competition, nitrosocarbonyls 1 can be generated
by the soft and clean photochemical6 fragmentation
of 1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxides 6, which represents the
best method for nitrosocarbonyl generation and was used also for their
detection by Toscano and co-workers.7

The studies of regioselectivity provided relevant insights on the
mechanism of chemical reactions; in the case of ene reactions,8 they became established as valuable experimental
tools to access the trajectory of the enophile attack. Recently, we
have reported the intriguing and remarkable changes in the regioselectivity
of the ene reactions of trisubstituted alkenes upon variation of the
nitrosocarbonyl substituent as well as the remarkable “cis”
selectivity of these ene reactions,9 with
important applications in the design and synthesis of N,O-nucleoside analogues.10

We showed that the ene reaction of nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A, generated through the mild oxidation of benzonitrile oxide
(BNO), with 2-methyl-2-butene 9a afforded a single ene
adduct 10Aa in an almost quantitative yield.4 Other isopentenyl derivatives 9b,c were also tested and were found to behave similarly,
and the results are reported in Scheme 2.9

Scheme 2 Ene Reactions of
Aromatic Nitrosocarbonyl Intermediates with Trisubstituted
Olefins
In fact, compounds 10Aa–c derive
from the addition of nitrosocarbonyl 1A to the less substituted
carbon atom of the C=C double bond, in nice keeping with the
prevailing HOMO(olefin)–LUMO(nitrosocarbonyl) interaction that orientates the nitrosocarbonyl electrophilic nitrogen
addition to the alkene in a Markovnikov (M) fashion.1b,4,9

Extending our investigations
to nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1B, generated from mesitonitrile
oxide 8 by addition
of NMO, comparable amounts of the M adducts 10Ba–c and the anti-Markovnikov (AM) adducts 11Ba–c were isolated. As shown in the Scheme 2 the M selectivity is fully relieved and
even slightly reversed in the ene additions of mesityl nitrosocarbonyl 1B.

Further insights on the origin of this variable
M selectivity were
obtained by investigating the ene reactions with the stereoisomeric
(E)- and (Z)-3-methyl-2-pentenes 12E and 12Z: they allowed for defining the stereochemical
paths and assessing the intriguing phenomenon known as the “cis
effect”.8,9 Typically, the “cis effect”
occurs in singlet oxygen 1O2 ene reactions and
refers to the neat preference of 1O2 for the
abstraction of the twix and lone allylic hydrogens from the more congested
side of an olefin (Figure 1, see inset).11 Other enophiles
display different selectivities: aromatic nitroso compounds (Ar–NOs)12 and triazolinediones (TADs)13 favor the M “end” selectivity but differ
in the “cis” preferences. The Ar–NOs maintain
some “cis” selectivity favoring the twix over the twin
abstraction; on the other side, TADs do not discriminate between the
two sites.

(in the inset). Arrows indicate the preferred sites of H abstraction
of the different enophiles. Comparison of regioselective outcome in
ene reactions of enophiles in the presence of olefins 12E,Z. Numbers represent percentage of H abstraction.

Addition of nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A to olefins 12E,Z afforded exclusively
the “cis”
ene adducts with a less strict M control with respect to the analogous
addition to olefins 9a–c (Figure 1). The dominating
path involves twix abstraction in both cases, while the minor products
derive from different reaction routes, nitrosocarbonyls being inclined
to the AM lone and Ar–NOs to the M twin routes. The experiments
performed with nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1B and olefins 12E,Z confirm the neat “cis effect”
as well as the relief of M control previously observed (see Scheme 2).

The results
show the impressive influence of the nitrosocarbonyl
substituent on the selectivities: the reactions are “cis”
specific and differ for the “end” selectivity. Nitrosocarbonyl
benzene 1A gives mainly the M twix adducts, while the
bulkier nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1B affords mixtures
of M twix and AM lone adducts. The comparison of these results with
those of other enophiles,11 such as 1O2, Ar–NOs, and TADs, locates nitrosocarbonyls
between the unselective 1O2 and the regiospecific
Ar–NO and TAD in ene reactions. The severe differences in the
attack trajectories for these four isoelectronic enophiles are the
more intriguing mechanistic puzzle that pushes for further experimental
and theoretical elucidations.

On pursuing our efforts and investigations
in this field, we have
chosen some 1-methylcycloalkenes,1413a–d, as suitable cyclic trisubstituted
olefins to investigate the balance between steric and conformational
factors dictating the regioselectivity in the ene reactions of nitrosocarbonyl
intermediates. These cyclic olefins served also as models for more
complex systems to be used as spacer in the construction of carbocyclic
nucleoside analogues.1b

Results and Discussion
Addition of benzhydroximoyl chloride 6 to a stirred
CH2Cl2 solution of NMO (1.2 equiv), Et3N (1.1 equiv), and excess of olefins (10 equiv) at room temperature
afforded the ene adducts of the alkenes 13a,c,d from moderate to high yields (see Experimental Section), along with small amounts of the corresponding
1,3-dipolar cycloadducts (2–8%). The reaction with the 1-methylcyclohexene 13b did not give any ene adduct, but a significative amount
(50%) of the benzoyl benzhydroxamic acid was isolated as the product
of nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A dimerization,1b,11 which strongly competes with the ene path (Scheme 3).

Table 1 reports
the regioisomeric ratios of the ene adducts in the reactions of nitrosocarbonyl
benzene 1A with 1-methylcycloalkenes 13a–d; the structures of all the isolated ene adducts
are based upon the corresponding analytical and spectroscopic data.

and NMO; [hν], from the 3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxide 6A or from 3,5-dimesityl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxide 6B.

Compounds 14Aa,c,d derive
from the addition of nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A to the
less substituted carbon atom of the double bond in nice keeping with
the M orientation and abstraction of the endocyclic twix allylic hydrogen
(red dot).

Adduct 14Aa shows the olefinic proton
(1H NMR spectra in DMSO) at δ 5.59 as a singlet, 14Ac at δ 5.65 as a triplet (J = 6
Hz), and 14Ad at δ 5.40 (t, J =
8 Hz). The CH–N
protons are shown as broad singlets at δ 5.44 and 5.00, while
the methyls are found at δ 1.66 and 1.72, respectively for 14Aa,c. The CH–N proton of adduct 14Ad is however shown as double doublet at δ 5.18 (J = 12, 3 Hz), and the methyls are at δ 2.30 due to
different conformational arrangement and consequent dihedral angles
between the coupled protons. Ene adducts 15Aa,d also derive from the M addition upon abstraction of the exocyclic
twin allylic hydrogens (red triangle). These compounds have not been
isolated but were detected in an inseparable mixture with the main
adducts 14. Identification and regioisomeric ratios rely
upon the 1H NMR spectra; the methylene protons of adduct 15Aa were found as singlets at δ 4.97 and 5.08, while
the same protons in adduct 15Ad are singlets at δ
4.96 and 5.12. Traces of the AM ene adduct 16Aa were
detected in the reaction mixture in the case of the reaction with
1-methylcyclopentene 13a where the nitrosocarbonyl 1A abstracts the allylic hydrogen marked with the red square
affording a cyclopentene derivative with two coupled vinyl protons
as multiplets at δ 5.79 and 6.05. Ene adduct 14Ab could not be obtained from the oxidative protocol, and its characterization
became possible by performing the reaction under photochemical conditions.
The reaction in fact affords the ene adduct 14Ab in 48%
yield corresponding to 100% abstraction of the allylic hydrogen according
to the M orientation (red dot). The structure of 14Ab relies upon the analytical and spectroscopic data and shows the
olefinic proton (1H NMR spectra in DMSO) at δ 5.63
as a singlet and the CH–N proton as broad singlet at δ
5.04, while the methyl is found at δ 1.63.

The experiments
performed with nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1B and olefins 13a–d were
conducted by adding mesitonitrile oxide 8 to a stirred
CH2Cl2 solution of NMO (1.2 equiv) and an excess
of the 1-methylcycloalkenes 13a–d (10 equiv) at room temperature. Different selectivities are observed
with respect to the olefin ring size. With the 5- and 6-membered ring
alkenes 13a,b, the M selectivity is relieved
when the aromatic substituent on the nitrosocarbonyl moiety turns
from the phenyl to the bulkier mesityl group. The structures of ene
adducts 14Ba,b, isolated in good yields
(44% and 62%, respectively), rely upon the spectroscopic data and
derive from the abstraction of the twix allylic proton (red dot).
In the 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO) of adduct 14Ba, the presence of a singlet at δ 5.62 indicates the presence
of the olefinic proton, while the broad signal at δ 4.20 corresponds
to the CH–N one. The methyl group is also found at δ
1.71. The 1H NMR spectrum of adduct 14Bb shows
the presence of the olefinic proton as a singlet at δ 5.67 and
the CH–N proton as a broad signal at δ 5.07, while the
methyl group is found at δ 1.69. The AM ene adducts 16Ba,b derive from the abstraction of the lone allylic proton
(red square) and were isolated in fair yields (42% and 18%, respectively).
In the 1H NMR spectrum of adduct 16bA, the
coupled signals of the olefinic protons are found at δ 5.83
and 6.10 as multiplets. Similarly, in adduct 16Bb, the
olefinic protons are found at δ 5.68 (dt, J = 10, 3 Hz) and 5.93 (d, J = 10 Hz). These selectivities
are in full accordance with the “cis effect” that is
in action for olefins 13a,b. With the 7-
and 8-membered ring alkenes 13c,d, the M
selectivity is totally restored even in the presence of the bulkier
mesityl group on the nitrosocarbonyl moiety. The ene adducts 14Bc,d are isolated in excellent chemical yields
(88% and 94%, respectively) with abstraction of the twix hydrogen
from the olefinic ring. The 1H NMR spectrum of adduct 14Bc shows the olefinic proton at δ 5.68 (t, J = 7 Hz) and the CH–N proton at δ 5.14 (d, J = 9 Hz), while the methyl group is at δ 1.75. Similarly,
the spectrum of adduct 14Bd shows the olefinic proton
at δ 5.26 (t, J = 7.5 Hz) and the CH–N
proton at δ 4.90 (dd, J = 12, 4 Hz), while
the methyl group is at δ 1.68. The observed selectivities from
7- and 8-membered ring olefins seem to be governed not only by the
electronic factors of the addends but also by conformational effects
orienting specifically the hydrogen abstraction toward the M pathway.

Table 1 also reports
the results obtained from the reactions between the 1-methylcycloalkenes 13a–d and the nitrosocarbonyls 1A,B generated from the photochemical cleavage of the
3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxide 6A and the 3,5-dimesityl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxide 6B. The values of the abstraction percentage are reported
in brackets and clearly indicate the total preference in these reactions
for the M pathway and the ene adducts 14 were the sole
isolated product, suggesting different topology and structures of
the first step TSs determining the selectivity outcome (vide
infra).

The results obtained from the oxidative method
confirm the remarkable
influence of the nitrosocarbonyl substituent on the selectivities
in the ene reactions with trisubstituted 1-methylcycloalkenes under
the required experimental conditions. Comparing these results with
those of the three isoelectronic enophiles 1O2, Ar–NO, and TAD (Table 2), some similarities and differences can be noted.15 As previously shown for the stereoisomeric pentenes 12E and 12Z (Figure 1), the new results confirm the location of
the nitrosocarbonyl intermediates between the unselective 1O2 and the regiospecific Ar–NO and TAD.

of allylic hydrogen abstraction.

Nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A strongly resembles the
Ar–NOs, showing a high twix preference with no lone abstraction
from 5- to 8-membered ring olefins 13a–d (or at least a tiny lone abstraction in 5-membered ring olefin).
An exception is represented by the results obtained with the 1-methylcyclooctene 13d, where the twix and twin hydrogens are abstracted by 1A, the twix hydrogen however being the major one, nicely
resembling the behavior of both TAD and Ar–NO, mainly the latter.

The bulkier nitrosocarbonyl mesitylene 1B affords
mixtures of M twix and AM lone adducts in the cases of the 5- and
6-membered rings in close similarity to the selectivities of the 1O2. As the ring size of the cyclic alkenes increases,
the twix abstraction by 1B becomes exclusive, and the
M selectivity is restored with cycloalkenes 13c,d at variance with the case of the 1O2.

A brief comment is here deserved on the results from the
photochemical
reactions reported in Table 1, which indicate the absolute M twix preference for both of
the nitrosocarbonyl intermediates 1A,B;
clearly the reaction conditions are not “bystanders”
in determining the selectivity. The electrophilic power of these fleeting
intermediates seems to be enhanced when they are photochemically generated.
Conversely, the origin of nitrosocarbonyl from nitrile oxide oxidation
by NMO, as well as the presence of the acid/base couple Et3N·HCl/Et3N due the nitrile oxide generation, could
have an unpredictable role in determining the selectivity, modifying
the true nature and structure of the enophile during the addition
step to the ene partner. On the other hand, the photochemical generation
of nitrosocarbonyl intermediates, being cleaner and milder and avoiding
the presence of extra chemical species, respects the electronic behavior
of both the addends, relieving the steric and conformational effects.
Nevertheless, the mechanism of fragmentation of the 1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxides
may deeply influence the selectivity outcome, that is, the method
of nitrosocarbonyl generation and its structure may differ from the
oxidative generation from nitrile oxides.

Trying to give a firm
reference point on this matter, we have already
detailed the mechanism of the ene reactions of nitrosocarbonyls1b in the light of recent mechanistic and kinetic
isotope investigations that provided evidence for the formation of
intermediates in the ene reactions of Ar–NOs.9 The stepwise mechanism involves a side-on attack at the
least substituted double bond carbon similar to the nonlinear approach
of carbene cycloadditions.16 The addition
leads to unsymmetrical polarized diradicals,12 which can rearrange to the ene adducts by H transfer or cyclize
to the aziridine N-oxide.9 The preference for the twix over the twin abstraction is due to
the “cis effect” because of the two favorable allylic
CH···O interactions assisting the initial approach
of the addends and comparable partitioning of the intermediates.9,12b,12c

To account for the convergence
of the selectivities of nitrosocarbonyl 1B and 1O2 and of nitrosocarbonyl 1A and Ar–NOs,
we have performed theoretical calculations
on the reaction of 1A,C (2,6-dimethylphenyl
nitrosocarbonyl 1C was used as model in DFT calculations)
with 1-methyl-cyclopentene 13a and 1-methyl-cyclohexene 13b, and the lowest M06/6-31G(d,p)17 transition structures (TSs) of the initial addition step for both
reactions are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

Figure 2 Side view of the M06/6-31G(d,p)
TSs for the reactions of [1A + 13a] and
[1C + 13a]. Activation energies are given
in kcal/mol. Bond distances are
in Å. The dotted lines indicate the N–C and O–H
contacts, and the steric clashes are shown (in red).

of [1A + 13b] and [1C + 13b]. Activation energies are given in kcal/mol. Bond distances
are
in Å. The dotted lines indicate the N–C and O–H
contacts, and the steric clashes are shown (in red).

Figure 2 shows the
typical side-on attack of the nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A at the C=C double bond of olefin 13a with extraction
of the allylic protons according to the three reported pathways. The
twix pathway passes through the more stable TS although the twin one
is only slightly higher in energy. The lone pass has to be reached
at higher energy, in nice keeping with the experimental results.

In the reaction between the 2,6-dimethylphenyl nitrosocarbonyl 1C and olefin 13a, Figure 2 shows the expected three TSs having slightly
different energies. In particular, the steric clashes evidenced by
the twix and twin approaches raise energetically the TSs making the
lone attack of comparable energy and thus favoring the AM selectivity.
Similarly, we have also located the TSs for the reactions with the
1-methyl-cyclohexene 13b that are shown in Figure 3. The TSs correspond to the
cyclohexene ring in a chairlike conformation that was found more stable
than the boat-like.

In spite of the fact that the reaction between 1A and
olefin 13b could be performed only under photochemical
conditions and looking at the TSs, the twin and lone attack gave less
stable TSs of about 2 kcal/mol and a complete M selectivity favors
only the twix extraction, following the electronic orienting factors,
ignoring any other route. Analogously, we have located the TS for
the reaction with the model nitrosocarbonyl 1C and olefin 13b; again the steric effects determine a slight diversion
of the selectivity. The twin and lone pathways are slightly less stable
than the twix; the twin path is somewhat disfavored for steric reasons,
and the twix is still preferred on the basis of electronic factors.

The TSs shown in Figures 2 and 3 are part of more complex mechanism
already accounted in previous works.9,10 The addition
step leads to polarized diradicals, which readily undergo H abstraction
to yield the ene adducts (Figure 4). The polarized diradicals are also connected through
a cyclization TS to the aziridine N-oxides, but the
cyclization path is more difficult than H-transfer, presumably because
the N-acyl substituent substantially destabilizes
the aziridine N-oxides, which bear a positive charge
on the nitrogen atom.

Figure 4 General enthalpic profile of the reactions of 1A,B with olefins 13a–d.

The consistency of the TSs shown
in Figures 2 and 3 was verified
through DFT IRC calculations, and the found trajectories correctly
connect reactants to products through the reported TSs.

Conclusion
The results point out that the ene reactions of nitrosocarbonyls
follow a nonlinear “cis” route because of the two favorable
CH···O interactions assisting the twix and lone approach.
In the reactions of 1-methylcycloalkenes the M twix path is favored
in the case of nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A, while steric
hindrance in the twix approach of 1B compensates its
electronic preference, and mixtures of twix and lone adducts are formed
with 5- and 6-membered rings, only. At variance with the 1O2 case, nitrosocarbonyls adopt side-on approaches like
Ar–NOs and TADs.

With larger rings (7- and 8-membered)
where the conformational
equilibria determine an increased mobility, the steric clashes are
presumably but reasonably relieved, and the M path is solely followed
by the reactions. The extension of the conformational analyses to
7- and 8-membered ring systems was also tried, resulting into an extremely
complex conformational ensemble quite difficult to be handled to give
a clear and reasonable explanation for the experimental results. In
addition to this, the reaction between nitrosocarbonyl benzene 1A and 1-methylcyclohexene 13b remains a unicum
in this panorama making the nitrosocarbonyl dimerization more competitive
than the ene reaction. The balance between steric and conformational
factors dictates the regioselectivity in the reaction between nitrosocarbonyl 1B and 1-methylcycloheptene 13c and 1-methylcyclooctene 13d; the increased ring size more than compensates the steric
hindrance effects of the mesityl group, making the M path the sole
reaction route.

These observations do not apply to the photochemical
reactions
that follow the single M pathway, indicating the need for a totally
different type of theoretical investigation. In fact, when generated,
nitrosocarbonyl intermediates are located at 1.90 Å distance
from the aromatic nitriles that are the second moiety deriving from
the heterocyclic fast fragmentation, thus suggesting a presumably
different approach to the ene partner, hence determining the selectivity
of the reactions (Scheme 4).18

of Nitrosocarbonyl Benzene from 3,5-Diphenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxide
Cycloreversion
Moving to the synthetic
point of view, unquestionably, trisubstituted
1-methylcycloalkenes provide valuable mechanistic information on nitrosocarbonyl
reactivity in view of their potential synthetic applications and in
particular in the preparation of nucleoside derivatives having small
or large carbocyclic rings as spacer between heterobases and hydroxy
functionalities (Scheme 5).19 Since the mesylate derivatives 17 can be easily prepared from literature protocols20 and functionalized with purine and pyrimidine
heterobases to afford the cycloalkane compounds 18, we
are planning thermal or photochemical generation of suitable nitrosocarbonyl
intermediates that will furnish the diastereomeric nucleoside analogues 19 through ene reaction, to be evaluated as potential antiviral
compounds. More over the double bond located on the carbocyclic spacer
represents a valuable functionality due to its double role: first,
it is able to reduce the conformational mobility of the spacer fixing
the nucleoside structure for an easier conformational analysis with
suitable receptors; second, the double bond is suitable for further
functionalizations, such as addition and cycloaddition reactions to
introduce other functional groups for the modulation of the structure–activity
relationship.

General Procedure
for Ene Reactions of Nitrosocarbonyl Mesitylene 1B
A solution of 1.61 g (10 mmol) of mesitonitrile
oxide 8 in 30 mL of CH2Cl2 was
added dropwise to a stirred solution of NMO (1.2 equiv) and excess
of olefins 13a–d (10 equiv) in 100
mL of CH2Cl2 at room temperature. After stirring
overnight, the reaction mixtures were washed twice with water (2 ×
50 mL), and the organic phases were dried on Na2SO4. Column chromatographic separations afforded the ene adducts 14Ba–d and 16Ba,b, which were isolated and crystallized.

General Procedure for Ene Reactions of Nitrosocarbonyls 1A,B Photochemically Generated
To a
solution of 2.42 g (25 mmol) of 3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-4-oxide 6A or 1.53 g (19 mmol) in 75 mL of MeOH, 25 mmol of the desired
olefins 13a–d were added. The solutions
were gently bubbled with nitrogen to get rid of the dissolved oxygen
and then irradiated in the sun or alternatively with two 310 nm lamps
for 4 h. The reaction mixtures were then evaporated to dryness, and
the residues were submitted to chromatographic separation to purify
the ene adducts. Ene adducts 14Aa,c,d and 14Ba–d were obtained
as single products in the following chemical yields: 14Aa, 69%; 14Ac, 84%; 14ad, 80%; 14Ba, 45%; 14bb, 47%; 14bc, 97%; 14Bd, 99%. They were found to be identical to the previously obtained
adducts. Adduct 14Ab was obtained in 48% yield as single
product, fully characterized.
