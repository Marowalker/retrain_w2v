The focus of the
work is the synthesis of SnS2 nanomaterials
with (peg-SnS2NF) and without (sf-SnS2NR) the involvement of the organic template and the
comparative study of their catalytic activities. The synthesis of
these materials was achieved in a single-step procedure aided by hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS). These nanoparticles were subjected to X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
and UV–vis spectroscopy analyses to investigate their structural,
topographical, surface, and optical properties. The present work suggests
that the surfactant-free SnS2 nanoring (sf-SnS2NR) catalyst has lower surface area compared to the
poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized SnS2 nanoflower (peg-SnS2NF) catalyst but shows high activity under
visible light for the photoreduction of Cr(VI) and the photocatalytic
degradation of organic dyes. The work exposed the importance of the
clean surfaces on the catalyst and is expected to have a high impact
on the photocatalytic activity of the SnS2 nanomaterial.
The study also endorses the utility of the HMDS-assisted synthetic
method for the production of multifunctional semiconductor tin disulfide
nanomaterials with multiple potential applications.

Introduction
The scientific community
is always working for the development
of an efficient and economical method for the elimination of pollutants
such as organic dye molecules and heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions.1 Among the heavy metal ions, especially, hexavalent
chromium compounds Cr(VI) are highly lethal, carcinogenic, and pollutants
found recurrently in wastewater from industrial processes.2−4 The semiconductor-based photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and disintegration
of organic pollutants have gained importance due to its remarkable
advantages, such as direct use of clean and safe solar energy, reusability,
and low cost.5−8 The multifunctional materials possessing more than one property
are more attractive for potent technological applications.9

Among the semiconducting metal sulfides,
tin disulfide (SnS2) can harvest visible light, which makes
them promising sensitizers
for wide band gap semiconductors and photocatalysts.10 Until now, numerous morphologies of SnS2 nanostructures,
such as fullerene-like nanoparticles,11 nanobelts,12 nanosheets,13 and nanoflakes,14 have been
produced successfully. Synthesis of these materials was achieved by
adopting various methods such as laser ablation,15 template-assisted solvothermal processes,12 coevaporation,16 and the sol–gel
synthetic route.17 However, almost all
these materials were covered by either organic surfactant molecules
or other inorganic materials. Such a covering of the surfaces precludes
any interaction that supposed to happen on their surfaces and thus
leading to the reduced catalytic activity compared to the potential
expected from the materials. There are efforts to increase the activity
and performance of the SnS2 catalyst by modifying their
properties with dopants and by making nanocomposites.10b−10h However, there are no reports on synthesizing and using SnS2 nanomaterials with unhindered free surfaces.

Herein,
we report the synthesis of surfactant-free SnS2 nanorings
(sf-SnS2NR) having free surfaces
by adopting a modified HMDS-assisted chemical synthetic procedure.
The systematic studies on the effect and importance of the clean surface
on the catalyst and morphology-controlled synthesis of SnS2 at nanolevel are also being performed. The unique multifunctional
ability of the tin sulfide nanorings as photocatalysts in both removals
of organic dyes, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO), and the
reduction of the polluting inorganic system like Cr(VI) are explored.
We have also produced SnS2 nanoflowers (peg-SnS2NF) with the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) template,
carried out a comparative study, and explained the superiority of sf-SnS2NR over peg-SnS2NF toward the reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of organic dye molecules.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis, Characterization, and Morphological
Analysis
For the present study, we have synthesized SnS2 nanostructures
without any organic surfactant molecules covering their surfaces as
well as the particles with a known amount of polymer (PEG) covering
the surfaces of the particles. Simple reactants/reagents were used
to synthesize these materials by single-step procedures to minimize
residuals and impurities (Scheme 1). The hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-assisted method
yielded sf-SnS2NR where there were no surfactant
molecules and yielded peg-SnS2NF where PEG
was used in the reaction. In these reactions, the role of HMDS was
multiple since it acted as the solvent, reducing agent and also provided
surroundings like the capping agent during the reaction. In the presence
of metal sources and thiourea, HMDS led to the formation of a polymeric
network by preventing the aggregation of the nanostructures. After
completion of the reaction, by applying high vacuum, HMDS was removed,
and finally, SnS2 nanostructures were obtained. In these
reactions, the HMDS molecules involved in the reaction but not a part
of either source materials or the product, and therefore, the reaction
was termed as the HMDS-assisted synthesis.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of Synthesis of sf-SnS2 NR and peg-SnS2 NF
The typical X-ray
diffraction patterns aided us to explore the
structural properties of the as-synthesized SnS2 nanostructures
(Figure 1a). The peaks
were indexed according to JCPDS data card no. 23-0677, and the corresponding
peaks confirmed the formation of the hexagonal structure of SnS2.18 No impurities were identified
in the XRD pattern demonstrating the phase purity of nanostructures.
The samples were further investigated by Raman spectra (Figure 1b) for the signature of vibrational
modes of the SnS2 material. The spectra of both samples
showed the strong characteristic peaks at 313.78 and 313.56 cm–1 for the sf-SnS2 NR and peg-SnS2 NF samples, respectively, which could
be assigned to the A1g mode of SnS2.19

Figure 2a displays
optical absorption by SnS2 nanostructures within the UV
and visible light spectra of wavelength ranging 250–700 nm.
The absorption maximum of the materials was around 385 nm.20 The broad spectrum in the visible region suggested
that both the SnS2 nanomaterials described here have the
capability of harvesting visible light and hence can act as the photocatalyst
while exposed to visible light. The band gap of both the SnS2 nanostructures by the Tauc method was found to be around 2.50 eV
predicting its ability to work as the photocatalyst on irradiation
of visible light. The band gaps determined from DRS spectra recorded
both the nanorings and nanoflowers were 2.55 and 2.45 eV, respectively.21

The morphology of the
resulting powdered sample from the reaction
was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The typical low-magnification
FESEM image of the sf-SnS2 (Figure 3a and Figure S1) revealed clearly that the sample has consisted of nanorings
(sf-SnS2NR) with an average diameter of 50
nm. Further, a high-magnification FESEM image was recorded (Figure 3b), which highlighted
the ring pattern of the sf-SnS2. The low-
and high-magnification FESEM images of the as-synthesized peg-SnS2 (Figure 3c,d, and Figure S1) showed the nanoflower
(peg-SnS2NF) morphology with an average diameter
of 100 nm. Even after the vigorous ultrasonic treatment, the hierarchical
structures maintained their integrity showing the structural stability
of the products.

Analysis by TEM also confirmed the formations of nanorings of the sf-SnS2 and nanoflowers of peg-SnS2 nanostructures (Figure 4 and Figure S3). A diffraction
pattern (Figure 4c)
consists of polycrystalline rings that can be indexed to the SnS2 phase (standard diffraction file no. 23-0677). The rings
were continuous and devoid of any separate bright spots indicating
the crystalline nature of sf-SnS2NR. A diffraction
pattern (Figure 4f)
for peg-SnS2NF showed the amorphous ring pattern
indicating that the PEG had indeed stabilized the SnS2NF.

(c, f) selected area diffraction pattern for both SnS2 nanostructures.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was
recorded to conclude
the chemical composition and bonding configuration of the as-synthesized
materials. The XPS spectrum (Figure 5) revealed the presence of Sn and S elements only,
and no other elements like N or Si were noticed. These findings showed
that as-synthesized materials were free from the surfactant on the
surfaces of the catalyst. The obtained results were in consistent
with the XRD and EDS results. Characteristic high-resolution XPS spectra
of Sn 3d and S 2p are shown in Figure 5b,c. The binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 (487.66
eV), Sn 3d3/2 (496.12 eV), and S 2p3/2 (163.30
eV) in SnS2 nanostructures were in agreement with the reported
characteristic values of Sn4+ and S2– in SnS2.22

synthesized sf-SnS2NR for the elements: (a)
survey spectrum, (b) Sn 3d, and (c) S 2p.

The broad band peak at 545 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum
of sf-SnS2NR was due to the vibration of Sn–S
bands (Figure 6). The
absence of any peak related to HMDS in the FTIR spectrum of Figure 6a confirmed
the complete absence of the capping agent on the surfaces of SnS2 nanorings.23 The presence of the
signature of PEG (Figure 6b) in the FTIR spectrum confirmed that PEG has effectively
worked as a surfactant to stabilize SnS2NF.

(a) sf-SnS2NR and (b) peg-SnS2NF.

The photocatalytic application
is mainly dependent on surface contact,
and hence, the surface area of the materials is an essential factor.
We have determined the surface area by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm for both the SnS2 nanostructures (Figure 7). It was observed clearly
that both the materials were mesoporous, and the BET surface areas
for sf-SnS2NR and peg-SnS2NF were 26.33 and 33.60 m2 g–1, respectively. The surface area of the flower-like nanostructures
was found to be higher than that of the ring-like nanostructure. This
observation was quite the opposite of the catalytic activity performance
(vide infra).

Photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
The results displayed
in Figure 8 elucidate
the photocatalytic reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) (at pH 3) using sf-SnS2 NR and peg-SnS2 NF as catalysts under visible light irradiation. Few controlled reactions
wherein (Figure S7) the direct photolysis
(in the absence of catalyst) or catalysis (in the absence of light)
alone could not drive the reduction of Cr(VI). Therefore, the reduction
of aqueous Cr(VI) was the photocatalytically driven reaction completely
rather than simple physical adsorption of Cr(VI). The formation of
photoreduced product Cr(III) from the toxic Cr(VI) in all these reactions
was confirmed by coordinating it with PDCA (Figure S8).23

absorption spectra showing a gradual decrease in the typical peak
intensity at λmax = 350 nm, by using sf-SnS2NR, corroborating 99% reduction of Cr(VI) in 10 min
and by using peg-SnS2NF, 84% reduction of
Cr(VI) in 18 min. (c, d) The recyclability of the SnS2 nanostructures.

In the presence of the sf-SnS2NR catalyst,
the toxic Cr(VI) reduction happened swiftly with a reaction rate of
0.244 min–1, approached 99% reduction, and reached
the equilibrium in 10 min. While in the case of peg-SnS2NF, a reaction rate of 0.0982 min–1 was observed and approached only 84% reduction in 18 min. Hence,
the sf-SnS2NR acts as a more active photocatalyst
for the reduction of Cr(VI) compared to photocatalysts in earlier
reports (Table 1).
Interestingly, in the case of catalytic decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide, Zboril and co-workers also noticed high catalytic activity
of iron(III) oxide nanoparticles having relatively lesser surface
area.24 All these results supported our
assumption clearly on the importance of clean surfaces on catalysts
rather than the larger surface area.

Effect of Amount of Catalyst and Pollutant
Cr(VI)
It
was necessary to understand the catalyst loading parameters after
the results above of stable and rapid photocatalytic activity of the sf-SnS2NR toward the reduction of toxic Cr(VI).
Therefore, the effect of the concentration of Cr(VI) and the amount
of catalyst on the rate of the reaction were studied while keeping
the other parameters constant. Figure 9 shows the reduction of Cr(VI) when the catalyst (sf-SnS2NR) quantities were varied. The irradiation
time required for the complete reduction of Cr(VI) decreased with
increasing initial dosage of the SnS2 photocatalyst. It
was observed that kapp depends on the
concentration of the Cr(VI) solution and the amount of catalyst added.
When the amount (between 0.15 and 0.60 g L–1) of sf-SnS2NR catalyst was varied, there was an incremental
change in the photocatalytic performance. The rate constant of the
reduction reaction had the linear relationship (from 0.01507 to 0.81122
min–1) with the amount of catalyst dosage. The increase
of the efficiencies of Cr(VI) reduction with the increase of the initial
amount of SnS2 can be ascribed to the increase in both
absorbed light and the numbers of surface active sites. These results
suggested that the photocatalytic activity of sf-SnS2NR could be improved by increasing the amount of catalyst.

Figure 9 Influence
of amount of catalyst on the photocatalytic reduction
of toxic Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III) using sf-SnS2NR as the photocatalyst. Catalyst dosage had a linear relationship
with the rate constant.

Furthermore, Figure 10 depicts the effect
of initial concentration of Cr(VI) aqueous
solution on the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) while keeping the
catalyst dosage (sf-SnS2NR) constant. It was
clear that the efficiencies of reduction of Cr(VI) in photocatalytic
systems consisting of 100 and 200 mg L–1 Cr(VI)
were observed to be 99 and 81%, respectively. (Rate constants were
0.244 and 0.088 min–1.) The decrease in the efficiencies
of the reduction reaction with the increase of initial Cr(VI) concentration
can be attributed to the following two aspects. First, since the reaction
occurs on the surface of the photocatalyst, the limited surface active
sites of the photocatalyst are not sufficient at higher Cr(VI) concentration.
Second, Cr(VI) in a high concentration can absorb the visible light
(420–480 nm), thus decreasing the proportion of light received
by the SnS2 photocatalyst.

of Cr(VI) (catalyst dosage constant,
0.03 g) on the photocatalytic reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to nontoxic
Cr(III) using sf-SnS2NR as the photocatalyst.
(a) 0.10 g of Cr(VI) and (b) 0.20 g of Cr(VI). Concentration of Cr(VI)
had an inverse relationship with the rate constants.

Effect of pH on Cr(VI) Reduction
The effect of pH on
the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) in the presence of sf-SnS2NR was examined by keeping the photocatalyst dosage
constant and varying the initial pH from 3 to 5. It was noticed that
the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) was retarded with increased
pH (Figure S4). There was a gradual decrease
in the rate constant: 0.24475 min–1 at pH 3 and
0.09406 min–1 at pH 5. It was witnessed that the
Cr(VI) reduction at low pH was much higher than that in a high pH
condition. It was assumed that the increased dissolution of sf-SnS2NR and along with lower concentration of
H+ in high pH was responsible for the decreased photocatalytic
activity.

Stability and Reusability
The stability and reusability
of any photocatalyst during the photocatalytic reaction are critical
factors for its industrial usage. Therefore, it is necessary to study
the stability of the as-synthesized sf-SnS2NR in the photocatalytic reduction reactions involving aqueous Cr(VI).
The recyclability of the catalyst for photocatalytic reduction of
Cr(VI) is illustrated in Figure 8c. The performance of the sf-SnS2NR photocatalyst did not show any significant loss up to 10 cycles.
This revealed the durability of sf-SnS2NR as
the photocatalyst in the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI). While checking
the reusability of both the SnS2 nanostructures for 10
cycles, it was observed that there was only 5% efficiency loss for sf-SnS2NR, whereas, in the case of peg-SnS2NF, the efficiency loss was 5–10% (Figure 8c,d).

We have
analyzed the catalyst after completion of the 10th cycle using SEM
and EDX to identify the accumulation of Cr on the catalyst surface.
There are no adsorbed chromium ions found over the catalyst surface
(Figures S2 and S6). The XRD pattern of
the materials was recorded after photocatalytic reduction, and no
change in the XRD pattern occurs after the reduction process (Figure S5). It implies that the sf-SnS2NR had high stability and did not corrode during the
photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), which showed its potential applications
for the treatment of polluted water.

Morphology Effect and the
Importance of Clean Surface on the
Catalyst
In the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), the ring-like
nanostructure was more efficient than nanoflower-like morphology (Figure 8). The rates of photocatalytic
reduction of Cr(VI) by sf-SnS2NR and peg-SnS2NF were compared by varying the quantity
of the catalysts (Figure 9). In every case, the sf-SnS2NR showed
superior photocatalytic activity than the peg-SnS2NF. The variance in the photocatalytic activity of both the
SnS2 nanomaterials may be explained by the collective action
of several factors. Except the specific surface area, almost all the
factors were the same as revealed by the various characterization
techniques, and it can be said that the difference in photocatalytic
activity of SnS2 nanomaterials was influenced exclusively
by a single parameter, that is, clean surfaces and morphology.

It is known that the adsorption and desorption of molecules on the
surface of catalysts directly affect the photocatalytic process. Thus,
the clean surfaces on the catalyst and relatively higher surface area
of the porous sf-SnS2NR allowed more number
of surface coordination sites exposed to the solution than the peg-SnS2NF. Moreover, the presence of clean surfaces
on the catalyst surface helped more efficient transportation of the
reactant molecules to the active sites and, thus, enhances the efficiency
of photocatalysis. The low surface area and surfactant-free surfaces
of the sf-SnS2NR make nanorings a better material
for the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) compared to the PEG-coated
nanoflower, that is, peg-SnS2NF.

SnS2 having a central metal ion with the d10 configuration
favors the separation of photogenerated charges due
to the highly dispersive conduction band. Afterward, the capture photoexcited
electron at the conduction band takes place. In this process, the
separated electron involves in the reduction of Cr(VI) to generate
Cr(III).34 As an evidence of the photoinduced
interfacial charge transfer process, the photoluminescence (PL) and
time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of sf-SnS2NR were recorded and compared with those of peg-SnS2NF (Figure 11).

Figure 11 (a) Steady-state PL spectra of sf-SnS2NR and peg-SnS2NF. (b) Time-resolved
transient
PL decay of sf-SnS2NR and peg-SnS2NF.

The sf-SnS2 NR showed a less intense PL peak compared
to the peg-SnS2 NF (Figure 11a). This observation suggested that the
interfacial charge transfer on sf-SnS2 NR inhibited the
recombination of photoinduced charge carriers.35 Afterward, the time-resolved transient photoluminescence
decay (TRPL) spectrum was recorded to understand this process (Figure 11b). The average
lifetime (⟨τ⟩) of sf-SnS2 NR (1.30
ns) was found to be less than that of peg-SnS2NF (2.49 ns). This drop in the lifetime points to the effective carrier
separation in clean surfaces of sf-SnS2NR.
When the transient photocurrent responses are studied, the sf-SnS2NR showed a good response compared to the response
of peg-SnS2NF (Figure S9). This phenomenon occurs because of the smooth transfer
of generated electrons from the conduction band (CB) to the valence
band (VB) of sf-SnS2NR, and this assumption
was validated with the quenching of emission.

The clean surfaces
remarkably enhanced the separation efficacy
of photoinduced charge carriers on sf-SnS2 NR through the photoinduced interfacial charge transfer Figure 9. In the photocatalysis
progression, the photogenerated holes were trapped by the hydroxyl
groups (or H2O) on the surface to yield OH· radicals. Meanwhile, the dissolved oxygen molecules react with electrons
and yield superoxide radical anions, O2·–, which on protonation generate the hydroperoxy,
HO2, radicals. This radical forms the hydroxyl radical
OH·, which involves the decomposition of the organic
dye. Altogether, the efficient charge separation on the clean surfaces
affords the enhanced photocatalytic activities. Therefore, all these
findings undoubtedly express the importance of clean surfaces on catalysts
to achieve high catalytic performance.36

Photocatalytic Degradation of Dyes
Apart from toxic
Cr(VI) reduction reactions, the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized sf-SnS2NR was found to have practical application
in the degradation of some water pollutants like organic dyes (RhB
and MO). Figure 12 reveals the results of the degradation of RhB by visible light irradiation
(sunlight) in the presence of the sf-SnS2NR. In the controlled reactions, no reaction happened in the absence
of light and SnS2 catalyst samples, indicating the importance
of the photocatalyst for the degradation of the dye (Figure S7). After addition of the photocatalyst, a rapid decrease
in peak intensity was observed. The complete degradation of 60 mL
of 5 mg L–1 RhB with 30 mg of sf-SnS2NR was observed in only 12 min. The apparent rate constant
(kapp) calculated from the linear plot
of ln[At]/[A0] versus time was found to be 0.1744 min–1. While
in the case of peg-SnS2NF, it took nearly
36 min to degrade the dye, and the rate constant (kapp) was calculated as 0.04695 min–1 (Figure 12a,b).
The decrease in absorption intensity of RhB at λmax with progression of the reaction time without any shift of the absorption
wavelength suggested complete cleavage of the RhB chromophores.

Rh B using sf-SnS2NR and peg-SnS2NF as the photocatalyst. (c, d) The recyclability of
the SnS2 nanostructures.

The efficiency of the sf-SnS2NR photocatalyst
for the degradation of the MO dye was also tested (Figure 13). Exceptional efficiency
was observed in the case of MO with a rate constant (calculated from
the linear plot of ln[At]/[A0] vs time) of 0.06752 min–1 and dye
degradation time of 30 min for 60 mL of 5 mg L–1 MO dye with 30 mg of sf-SnS2NR (Figure 13a,b). While in
the case of peg- SnS2NF, it took nearly 48
min to degrade the dye, and the apparent rate constant (kapp) was calculated as 0.03313 min–1. In these cases, no noticeable degradation and no shift in peak
positions were observed in the absence of the SnS2 catalyst
under the same experimental conditions. Hence, we found that the sf-SnS2NR is the best photocatalyst for the photocatalytic
reactions.

The mechanism of photoreduction
of Cr(VI) and degradation of pollutants
like RhB and MO is illustrated in Figure 14. Due to the narrow band gap, the sf-SnS2NR can be excited by sunlight efficiently
to produce electron–hole pairs. Due to the availability of
free and clean surfaces on the catalyst, the generated charges will
quickly be promoted to the excited state. Simultaneously, the recombination
of electron–hole pairs was suppressed owing to the direct oxidization
of pollutants.

Figure 14 Schematic representation of mechanism of the SnS2 photocatalyst.

The catalysts were reused
in the water purification to determine
the durability of the photocatalyst. For this purpose, the reaction
mixture was centrifuged after each run of the reactions to separate
the catalyst. Then, the regenerated catalyst was reused with the fresh
reactants in the subsequent cycle of the photocatalytic reaction under
the same experimental conditions. The results showed that the sf-SnS2NR could be used repeatedly for at least
10 times without significant deactivation. However, the peg-SnS2NF displayed a gradual decrease in dye degradation
after five cycles. The peg-SnS2NF was not
robust since it contained big-sized SnS2 nanoflowers that
may perhaps be leached easily in the liquid phase reaction.

Conclusions
By the simple wet chemical approach, surfactant-free SnS2 nanorings (sf-SnS2NR) and PEG-stabilized
SnS2 nanoflowers (peg-SnS2NF) were
prepared at gram scale. The developed semiconductor tin disulfide
nanomaterials showed multiple potential applications, especially in
photoreduction and photodegradation. It was emphasized that as-synthesized
SnS2 nanostructures exhibited great photocatalytic activity
in the reduction of carcinogenic Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III) under
ambient conditions. The SnS2 nanostructures efficiently
degraded mutagenic dyes (MO and RhB) to nontoxic products in a shorter
period. The improved photoactivities are ascribed to the effective
charge transfer across the clean surfaces of the catalyst, as evidenced
by the electron microscopic analyses and steady-state and time-resolved
transient photoluminescence decay studies. In all cases, the reusability
of the sf-SnS2NR photocatalyst was excellent
over many cycles.

The excellent photocatalytic behavior of SnS2 can be
credited to the following factors. (i) The clean surfaces on the catalyst
enhanced electron mobility in the nanorings. (ii) The specific 2D
morphology of the ring structure also contributed to the efficient
charge carrier separation in the material. Therefore, the present
work provides new insight into developing photocatalysts with clean
surfaces for the effective charge separation and photocatalytic remediation
of pollutants from wastewater.

Experimental Section
Materials
Tin(IV)
chloride (SnCl4·5H2O, 99%), hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS, 99%), and thiourea (TU)
(99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Potassium dichromate
(K2Cr2O7, 99%), RhB (99%), and MO
(99%) were obtained from Merck, India. All chemicals were used without
any further purification.

Instrumentation
XRD patterns of
the products were collected
at room temperature using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with
a scan rate of 1° min–1 in a 2θ range
from 10° to 80° (Cu Kα = 1.54 Å; operating current
= 30 mA; operating voltage = 40 kV). Surface morphology, particle
size, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were studied using
an Ultra 55 Carl Zeiss instrument (operating voltage = 10 kV). To
do TEM measurements, the as-synthesized nanomaterials were suspended
in isopropanol followed by sonication for 3 min and then dispersed
on carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh). Images were acquired using
an FEI Technai G2 20 STEM with a 200 kV acceleration voltage.

The Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw microscope at
a wavelength of 632 nm. A JASCO 5300 spectrophotometer was used to
record the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra on the KBr pellet
containing the samples. Solid-state UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV–vis spectrometer.
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-synthesized SnS2 materials were recorded and transformed into the absorption
spectra using the Kubelka–Munk function. The direct band gaps
of SnS2 nanostructures were obtained from the Tauc plot
(where n = 1/2). Solution-phase UV spectra during
photocatalysis reactions were recorded using a JASCO-V770 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. Surface area and pore size analyses were determined
from the BET studies, and BET analysis was recorded by the Quantachrome
Instruments.

Synthesis Section
Synthesis of Surfactant
Free-SnS2 Nanorings (sf-SnS2 NR)
Surfactant-free tin disulfide
(sf-SnS2) nanomaterials were prepared by a
one-pot approach using standard Schlenk line techniques under an inert
atmosphere. The typical procedure is as follows. The precursors of
tin (SnCl4·5H2O = 0.200 g, 0.57 mmol) and
sulfur (thiourea = 0.086 g, 1.14 mmol) were added in a 1:2 ratio and
were mixed with excess hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) (5 mL, 23.85 mmol)
in a 100 mL two-necked flask under a N2 atmosphere (Table 2). The temperature
was raised and refluxed for 3 h to complete the reaction. After cooling,
the obtained yellow particles were collected by centrifugation and
washed with abundant deionized water and methanol to remove unreacted
starting materials. Finally, the product was dried under vacuum at
120 °C for 3 h before further analysis.

Synthesis of PEG-SnS2 Nanoflowers
(peg-SnS2 NF)
To prepare peg-SnS2NF, we have followed the same experimental procedure
as mentioned above.
Additionally, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-400) (10 mL) was added to
the reaction flask containing other reactants: tin and sulfur
sources, (Table 2)
and HMDS. After completion of the reaction, the resultant yellow powder
was isolated and washed many times with deionized water (3 ×
20 mL) followed by methanol (3 × 20 mL) repeatedly, separated
by centrifugation, and dried at 120 °C for 3 h for analysis.

Photocatalytic Activity
General Description of Photocatalytic Activity
Test
The photocatalytic activities of both sf-SnS2NR and peg-SnS2NF were assessed
from the experiment
of degradation/reduction of different pollutants. All of the photocatalytic
tests were performed under standard conditions at room temperature
with exposure to natural sunlight, which covered the entire wavelength
distribution of the light in the visible region.

The photocatalyst
(SnS2 or peg-SnS2; 30 mg) was added to 60 mL
of either Rh-B (5 mg/L), MO (5 mg/L), or Cr(VI) (100 mg/L of pH 3)
aqueous solution separately. Then, the reaction mixtures were stirred
under dark for 1 h under the open environment at room temperature
to ensure the formation of the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
between the catalyst and reactants. Then, from the stock solution,
60 mL of suspension was positioned inside a beaker and irradiated
with the sunlight. After regular intervals of time, 3 mL of a sample
was taken and centrifuged at 3000 rpm to remove the catalyst. The
concentrations of the reaction mixture in the supernatant solution
were determined by recording absorption spectra. A gradual decrease
in the characteristic absorption peak at 550 nm (Rh B), 450 nm (MO),
and 350 nm (Cr(VI)) was noted, and each experiment was repeated twice.

The reduction and degradation efficiency was calculated by using
the following eq 1: 1  The photocatalytic
degradation
rate of Cr(VI) and organic dyes followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood eq 2 2  where kapp is the apparent rate constant of the pseudo-first
order, t is the irradiation time, and C0 and C are the initial and instant residual
concentrations
of the Cr(VI), Rh B, and MO solution. Reduction and degradation experiments
were carried out on a recycled SnS2 sample to study the
stability of the SnS2 photocatalyst.

Cr(VI) Reduction
Test
The photocatalytic reaction was
performed at room temperature. In a beaker, 30 mg of photocatalyst
and 60 mL of 100 mg L–1 K2Cr2O7 aqueous solution (pH = 3) were stirred for a sufficient
amount of time to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium.
Then, it was exposed to sunlight to initiate the reaction.

To
confirm the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), we have performed
few controlled reactions by following our previous article.23,25 The reduced product Cr(III) was confirmed by forming a metal complex
with 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid (PDCA). The controlled reactions
were monitored by UV–vis spectra, and the results are displayed
in Figure S8.

Degradation of Organic
Dyes
The photocatalytic dye
degradation experiments were performed by measuring the optical absorption
of the organic pollutants. By determining the peak intensity of the
dye against time in the presence of catalyst under visible light irradiation,
the photocatalytic activity was studied. Thirty milligrams of sf-SnS2NRor peg-SnS2NF was utilized for the degradation of 60 mL of 5 mg L–1 solutions of RhB and MO, respectively.

Catalyst
Reproducibility and Stability
Initially, the
stability of synthesized SnS2 nanostructures was checked
by execution of XRD studies on the samples stored up to 1 month. All
the photocatalytic experiments were repeated several times by varying
the amounts of catalyst and concentrations of the substrates. The
reduction of Cr(VI) and dye degradation were carried out up to 10
times with the recycled SnS2 catalyst to check the stability
of the catalyst and reproducibility of the obtained results. After
completion of each cycle, the photocatalyst was recovered by centrifugation,
washed with 1 M nitrite acid solution and deionized water to diminish
the amount of Cr(III) deposited on the surface of the catalyst, and
dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 4 h.
