The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor
(GRPR), a G protein-coupled
receptor, is overexpressed in solid malignancies and particularly
in prostate cancer. We synthesized a novel bombesin derivative, [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1, evaluated its pharmacokinetics and potential
to image GRPR expression with positron emission tomography (PET),
and compared it with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1. ProBOMB1 (DOTA-pABzA-DIG-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-ψ(CH2N)-Pro-NH2) was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The polyaminocarboxylate
chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid
(DOTA) was coupled to the N-terminal and separated
from the GRPR-targeting sequence by a p-aminomethylaniline-diglycolic
acid (pABzA-DIG) linker. The binding affinity to GRPR was determined
using a cell-based competition assay, whereas the agonist/antagonist
property was determined with a calcium efflux assay. ProBOMB1 was
radiolabeled with 68GaCl3. PET imaging and biodistribution
studies were performed in male immunocompromised mice bearing PC-3
prostate cancer xenografts. Blocking experiments were performed with
coinjection of [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14). Dosimetry calculations were performed with
OLINDA software. ProBOMB1 and the nonradioactive Ga-ProBOMB were obtained
in 1.1 and 67% yield, respectively. The Ki value of Ga-ProBOMB1 for GRPR was 3.97 ± 0.76 nM. Ga-ProBOMB1
behaved as an antagonist for GRPR. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was
obtained in 48.2 ± 10.9% decay-corrected radiochemical yield
with 121 ± 46.9 GBq/μmol molar activity and >95% radiochemical
purity. Imaging/biodistribution studies showed that the excretion
of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was primarily through the renal pathway.
At 1 h postinjection (p.i.), PC-3 tumor xenografts were clearly delineated
in PET images with excellent contrast. The tumor uptake for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was 8.17 ± 2.57 percent injected dose
per gram (% ID/g) and 9.83 ± 1.48% ID/g for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1,
based on biodistribution studies at 1 h p.i. This corresponded to
tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios of 20.6 ± 6.79
and 106 ± 57.7 for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 and 8.38 ±
0.78 and 39.0 ± 12.6 for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1, respectively.
Blockade with [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14) significantly reduced the average uptake
of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 in tumors by 62%. The total absorbed
dose was lower for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 in all organs except
for bladder compared with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1. Our data suggest
that [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 is an excellent radiotracer for
imaging GRPR expression with PET. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 achieved
a similar uptake as [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 in tumors, with enhanced
contrast and lower whole-body absorbed dose.

Introduction
Gastrin-releasing
peptide receptor (GRPR) is a G protein-coupled
receptor of the bombesin (BBN) receptor family.1−3 Together with
its endogenous ligand, gastrin-releasing peptide, GRPR is involved
in synaptic plasticity, emotional, and feeding behavior, hormone secretion,
smooth muscle contraction, and cell proliferation.1−3 In normal conditions,
the expression of GRPR is restricted to the central nervous system,
pancreas, adrenal cortex, and gastrointestinal tract.4 GRPR is also implicated in neoplastic progression, with
overexpression of GRPR having been reported in many cancer subtypes
including lung, head and neck, colon, kidney, ovarian, breast, and
prostate cancers.5 This ectopic expression
in cancers makes it an attractive target for personalized therapies.

BBN (Pyr-Gln-Arg-Leu-Gly-Asn-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) derivatives have been radiolabeled for imaging with single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission
tomography (PET) and for therapy with beta and alpha emitters.6−8 The minimum sequence required for GRPR binding is BBN(7-14).9 Often, the radiolabel complex is appended directly
onto the structure or via a linker at the N-terminus, while modifications
at the C-terminus dictates agonist/antagonist properties. For targeting
GRPR, antagonists are preferred because agonists have been shown to induce gastrointestinal adverse
events.10 Examples of GRPR antagonists
evaluated in the clinic include [68Ga]Ga-RM2, [68Ga]Ga-SB3, [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1, [68Ga]Ga-RM26,
[18F]F-BAY-864367, and [64Cu]Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06.9,11−16

Coy et al. reported that reduction of the peptide bond between
residues 13 and 14 of BBN to −CH2–NH–
can yield potent antagonists.17 On the
basis of this work, the Schally group reported a series of pseudononapetide
BBN antagonists with a reduced bond (CH2–NH or CH2–N) between residues 13-14 (Leu13ψAA14).18 Several of those exhibited
picomolar binding affinity for murine GRPR and some were able to inhibit
growth of prostate, breast, colon, lung, liver, pancreas, ovary, kidney,
and glioma cancers in preclinical models.5,19−23 Despite their high binding affinity and antitumor activity, to the
best of our knowledge, no radiolabeled [Leu13ψAA14]BBN derivative has been reported for cancer imaging. We
report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel BBN antagonist,
[68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (68Ga-DOTA-pABzA-DIG-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-ψ-Pro-NH2), based
on the sequence of the previously reported RC-3950-II (d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-ψ-Tac-NH2; Tac: 4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid; Figure 1).

Results
Chemistry, Radiolabeling, and Hydrophilicity
The radiolabeling
precursors ProBOMB1 and NeoBOMB1 were obtained in 1.1 and 39% yields,
respectively. The nonradioactive standards Ga-ProBOMB1 and Ga-NeoBOMB1
were obtained in 67 and 38% yields, respectively. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
was obtained in 48.2 ± 10.9% decayed-corrected isolated yield
with 121 ± 46.9 GBq/μmol molar activity and 96.9 ±
1.4% radiochemical purity (n = 6). [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 was obtained in 34.0 ± 11.8% decayed-corrected
isolated yield with 239 ± 87.3 GBq/μmol molar activity
and 96.4 ± 0.8% radiochemical purity (n = 3).
log D7.4 values of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
and [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 were −2.34 ± 0.05 and
−0.88 ± 0.02 (n = 3), respectively.

Binding Affinity and Agonist/Antagonist Characterization
The binding affinities of [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14), Ga-ProBOMB1, and Ga-NeoBOMB1
for GRPR were measured in PC-3 cells (Supporting Information Figure S1). The compounds successfully displaced
binding of [125I-Tyr4]bombesin in a dose-dependent
manner. Ki values for [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14),
Ga-ProBOMB1, and Ga-NeoBOMB1 were 10.7 ± 1.06, 3.97 ± 0.76,
and 1.71 ± 0.28 nM, respectively. Differences in binding affinity
were statistically significant between compounds (p < 0.05).

Intracellular calcium release of PC-3 cells was
measured for Ga-ProBOMB1 (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S2). Bombesin (5 and 50 nM) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
(50 nM) induced calcium release corresponding to 535 ± 52.0,
549 ± 58.7, 511 ± 45.5 RFUs, compared with 18.3 ± 5.4
RFUs for buffer control. Differences were statistically significant
(p < 0.001). For [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14) (5 and 50 nM), 22.3
± 16.8 and 42.0 ± 20.4 RFUs were observed, while 22.3 ±
14.4 and 16.0 ± 3.7 RFUs were observed for Ga-ProBOMB1 (5 and
50 nM). Differences compared with buffer control were not statistically
significant.

PET Imaging, Biodistribution,
and Stability
Representative
maximum intensity projection PET/CT images (1 and 2 h p.i.) are shown
in Figure 3. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 and [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 enabled clear
visualization of PC-3 tumor xenografts. [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1
was excreted via both the hepatobiliary and renal pathways, while
[68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was primarily cleared through the renal
pathway. For [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1, the highest activity was
observed in bladder followed by tumor. For [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1,
activity was observed in tumor, liver, pancreas, bowel, and bladder.
Faster clearance of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 compared with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 led to higher contrast images. Co-injection
of [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14) decreased the average uptake of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
in tumors by 62%.

[68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 and (B) [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
acquired at 1 or 2 h p.i. in mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts. Blocking
was performed with coinjection of 100 μg of [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14).
Color bar is in units of % ID/g from 0 to 15. t = tumor; l = liver;
p = pancreas; b = bowel; bl = bladder.

For biodistribution, uptake (% ID/g) of selected organs for
[68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 and [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 were
compared
(Figure 4). Thirty
minutes p.i., the PC-3 tumor uptake was lower for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
(4.62 ± 2.13) than for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 (9.60 ±
0.99) (p < 0.001). The tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was 8.17 ± 2.13 at 60 min and 8.31 ± 3.88
at 120 min and that of [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 was 9.83 ±
1.48 at 60 min and 12.1 ± 3.72 at 120 min (not significantly
different). Uptake of blood, liver, pancreas, and kidney for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was lower than that for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1
at all time-points (p < 0.05). In particular,
pancreatic uptake was markedly lower at 30, 60, and 120 min for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (respectively: 10.4 ± 3.79, 4.68 ±
1.26, 1.55 ± 0.49) compared with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1
(respectively: 95.7 ± 12.7, 122 ± 28.4, 139 ± 26.8).
Muscle uptake was only significantly lower in [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
versus [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 at 60 and 120 min (p < 0.01). For all other collected organs (Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2), with the exception
of seminal vesicles at 60 min, there was less uptake with [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 than [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1, although that was
not always statistically significant. When co-injected with [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14)
(Figure 5), tumor uptake
of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 at 60 min was significantly reduced
to 3.12 ± 1.68 (p < 0.01). Injected radiolabeled
peptide mass for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 (6.01 ± 2.89 pmol)
and [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (20.24 ± 12.9 pmol) was different
(p < 0.001) but had overlapping ranges at 30 and
60 min.

The stability of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was measured
in plasma
at 5 min postinjection (p.i.). According to high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) results (Figure 6), [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (tR = 8.84 min) was 96.3 ± 2.7% intact. A minor metabolite
peak was observed at tR = 2.72 min.

Dosimetry
The absorbed doses in mice are shown in Figure 7 and Supporting Information Table S3, based on kinetic
curves derived from biodistribution data (Supporting Information Figures S3 and S4). The organ that received the
highest dose from [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was the urinary bladder
(10.00 mGy/MBq). Besides the urinary bladder, all other organs received
less than 1 mGy/MBq. Higher doses were observed for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 in most organs including pancreas (8.00 mGy/MBq),
kidneys (3.29 mGy/MBq), and large and small intestines (3.24 and 3.15
mGy/MBq).

The estimated absorbed whole-body dose for an average
adult human
male was also computed (Table 1). Consistent with the mouse model, higher doses were obtained
for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 than [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
across all organs except for bladder (5.69 × 10–2 vs 6.59 × 10–2 mGy/MBq). Notably, the pancreas
is expected to receive 2.63 × 10–1 mGy/MBq
for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 versus 1.44 × 10–2 mGy/MBq for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1. The kidney is expected
to receive 1.69 × 10–2 mGy/MBq for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 versus 4.32 × 10–3 mGy/MBq
for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1.

Discussion
There is longstanding
interest in the development of radiopharmaceuticals
targeting GRPR, because of overexpression of this receptor in cancer.
The overexpression is strongly correlated with estrogen receptor positivity
in breast cancer,24 and cohort studies
have shown GRPR antagonists to be effective in detecting primary and
metastatic lesions in patients.12,25 There is extensive
literature supporting the use of GRPR radiopharmaceuticals for prostate
cancer in patients.6,9,26 Because
of tumor heterogeneity, it has been postulated that GRPR radiotheranostics
can complement prostate-specific membrane antigen agents to improve
prostate cancer management.27,28

We synthesized
[68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 based on the sequence
of RC-3950-II, a [Leu13ψAA14]BBN derivative.17 We replaced the last amino acid Tac14 with Pro14, as proline shows good structural homology
(Figure 1) and is readily
available from commercial sources. Following the conjugation of Pro14 to the rink-amide resin, we conducted reductive amination
on solid-phase to form Fmoc-Leu-ψ(CH2N)-Pro-resin.
The low isolated yield of ProBOMB1 is likely because of the low yield
of this reductive amination step. While sufficient precursor was obtained
for preclinical studies, further optimization will be required for
clinical translation. For example, it may be better to first couple
Leu to Pro via reductive amination in solution phase before coupling
onto the resin. Compared with the native BBN sequence, RC-3950-II
also has a d-Phe6 substitution which enhances
binding potency29 and is present in other
antagonists such as RM215 and NeoBOMB1.13,30 The radiometal/chelator complex ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA) was appended
at the N-terminus of the GRPR-targeting sequence and separated by
a pABzA-DIG linker, a modular design that parallels that of [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1. Recently, Nock et al. presented the first-in
man study in four prostate cancer patients.13 [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 was well-tolerated and generated high-contrast
PET images. The tracer successfully localized to the primary prostate
tumor and distant metastatic sites (lymph nodes, liver, and bone).
The authors are exploring the use of 177Lu-labeled NeoBOMB1
for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.

The Ki value of Ga-ProBOMB1 for GRPR
(3.97 ± 0.76 nM) was approximately twofold higher than Ga-NeoBOMB1.
It was also higher than the reported value for RC-3950-II (0.078 nM);
however, the latter value was determined using murine Swiss 3T3 cells.17 We proceeded to study the agonist/antagonist
properties of Ga-ProBOMB1 using a calcium efflux assay (Figure 2). While BBN and ATP significantly
induced intracellular calcium release (>500 RFUs) compared with
buffer
control (18.3 ± 5.4 RFUs), Ga-ProBOMB1 behaved as an antagonist
and did not significantly induce calcium release (16.0 ± 3.7
RFUs). For GRPR, this property is important for tolerability in humans.
Moreover, for selected peptide-receptor systems such as somatostatin,
there is a paradigm shift, favoring the use of antagonists over agonists
for tumor targeting.31

PET imaging
demonstrated that [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 and
[68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 were able to detect GRPR-expressing PC-3
prostate cancer xenografts (Figure 3). [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 cleared rapidly through
the renal pathway to yield high-contrast images at 1 h p.i. We noted
that tumor uptake was retained at 2 h p.i. for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1,
in conjunction with a further reduction in background activity. This
suggests the optimal imaging window can be extended beyond 1 h timepoint
without compromising sensitivity or contrast. Target specificity was
confirmed with successful tumor blockade with [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14).

Our biodistribution data were in agreement with PET imaging studies
(Figures 4 and 5). The uptake of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (%
ID/g) in tumor increased from 4.62 ± 2.13 at 30 min to 8.31 ±
3.88 at 2 h. Similarly, the uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1
in tumor increased from 9.60 ± 0.99 at 30 min to 12.1 ±
3.72 at 2 h. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 showed slower tumor targeting
and accumulation but faster clearance from blood (0.13 ± 0.01
vs 0.45 ± 0.10 at 2 h) than [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 had better contrast ratios at 1 h p.i.: tumor-to-blood
(20.6 ± 6.79 vs 8.38 ± 0.78), tumor-to-muscle (106 ±
57.7 vs 39.0 ± 12.6), tumor-to-kidney (6.25 ± 2.33 vs 1.66
± 0.26), and tumor-to-liver (7.33 ± 2.97 vs 2.00 ±
0.55). The slightly lower uptake of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 in
tumor xenografts can be explained by its lower binding affinity to
GRPR, whereas the better contrast can be attributed to differences
in hydrophilicity. Interestingly, we observed significantly lower
pancreas uptake for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (4.68 ± 1.26
and 1.55 ± 0.49% ID/g at 1 and 2 h) compared with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 (123 ± 28.4 and 139 ± 26.8% ID/g at 1 and
2 h). The results obtained for [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 were comparable
to those presented by Dalm et al.,30 with
the exception of the higher pancreas uptake noted in our study. The
high pancreas uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 can potentially
be attributed to differences in molar activity and/or mouse strain.
Dalm et al. injected 250 pmol of [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 for
biodistribution studies, and uptake in tumor and pancreas was approximately
∼10 and 15% ID/g, respectively, in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumors.30 From the same paper, when greater mass of peptide
was injected for [177Lu]Lu-NeoBOMB1 (200 vs 10 pmol), pancreas
uptake was reduced.

A general limitation of BBN-based radiopharmaceuticals
is their
metabolic stability, as BBN is susceptible to enzymatic cleavage by
neutral endopeptidase.32,33 [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
was >95% stable in plasma at 5 min p.i. While a minor hydrophilic
metabolite peak was observed, its identity was not interrogated in
this study. The stability of the compound is promising for translation
or for repositioning as a radiotherapeutic agent. The 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid (DOTA) chelator can form stable complexes with therapeutic trivalent
radiometals such as 90Y-yttrium or 177Lu-lutetium,
to create a theranostic pair.

Dosimetry was calculated for mice
and extrapolated to the adult
human male. When compared with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1, the absorbed
dose for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 in mice was lower across all
organs except for urinary bladder (9.33 vs 10.00 mGy/MBq). With [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1, mice received approximately one-sixth and
one-tenth the estimated absorbed dose for kidneys and pancreas. For
the human model, lower doses were also obtained for [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1. Accordingly, the average adult male is predicted
to receive approximately one-quarter and one-twentieth the absorbed
dose for kidneys and pancreas, respectively.

Conclusion
We
synthesized a novel GRPR imaging agent, [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1,
based on the [Leu13ψAA14]BBN family. The
radiopharmaceutical exhibited nanomolar affinity for GRPR and high
stability in vivo. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 was able to generate
high-contrast PET images with good tumor uptake in a prostate cancer
model. [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 had a better dosimetry profile
compared with [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 and warrants further translational
studies.

Materials and Methods
General Methods
All reagents and
solvents were purchased
from commercial sources and used without further purification. [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14) and bombesin were purchased from Bachem and AnaSpec,
respectively. Other peptides were synthesized on an AAPPTec Endeavor
90 peptide synthesizer. HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1260 infinity
system (model 1200 quaternary pump, model 1200 UV absorbance detector
set at 220 nm, Bioscan NaI scintillation detector). HPLC columns used
were a semipreparative column (Luna C18, 5 μm, 250 × 10
mm) and an analytical column (Luna, C18, 5 μ, 250 × 4.6
mm) from Phenomenex. Mass analyses were performed using an AB SCIEX
4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI)
ion source. 68Ga—gallium was eluted from an iThemba
Labs generator and purified according to previously published procedures
using a DGA resin column from Eichrom Technologies LLC.34 Radioactivity of 68Ga-labeled peptides
was measured using a Capintec CRC-25R/W dose calibrator, and the radioactivity
in tissues collected from biodistribution studies were counted using
a PerkinElmer Wizard2 2480 gamma counter.

Synthesis of
Fmoc-p-aminomethylaniline
FmocOSu (10.12
g, 30 mmol) in 60 mL acetonitrile was added dropwise
to a solution of 4-aminobenzylamine (3.67 g, 30 mmol) and triethylamine
(2.79 mL, 30 mmol) in 30 mL acetonitrile and stirred overnight. Water
(100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the precipitate was
collected after filtration. The precipitate was washed thrice with
ethanol/ether (1:1, 50 mL) and dried under vacuum to obtain the product
as white powder (yield: 5.5 g, 53%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 7.89 (d, J = 7.4
Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.70 (d, J = 7.4 Hz,
2H, Ar), 7.42 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.32 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H, Ar), 6.89 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 2H, Ar),
6.50 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 2H, Ar), 4.94
(s, 2H, NH2), 4.31 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H, OCH2), 4.21 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 1H, CH2CH), 4.00
(d, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H, NHCH2). ESI-MS: calculated [M + H]+ for Fmoc-p-aminomethylaniline C22H20N2O2, 345.2; found, 345.2.

Synthesis of Fmoc-p-aminomethylaniline Diglycolate
Diglycolic anhydride
(1.09 g, 9.4 mmol) was added to a suspension
of Fmoc-p-aminomethylaniline (2.94 g, 8.6 mmol) in
dichloromethane (30 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h
and filtered. The collected solid was washed thrice with dichloromethane
(50 mL) and dried under vacuum to obtain the product as white powder
(yield: 2.87 g, 73%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 9.87 (s, 1H, NH), 7.89 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.80 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 1H, NHCH2), 7.69 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.57 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.42 (t, J =
7.3 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.32 (t, J = 7.3
Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.15 (d, J = 8.4 Hz,
2H, Ar), 4.35 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H,
OCH2), 4.27–4.22 (m, 1H, CH2CH), 4.22–4.19 (m, 2H, NHCH2), 4.18–4.08 (m, 4H, O(CH2)2). ESI-MS: calculated [M + H]+ for Fmoc-p-aminomethylaniline diglycolate C26H24N2O6, 461.2; found, 461.3.

Synthesis of ProBOMB1
ProBOMB1 was synthesized on solid-phase
using Fmoc-based approach. Rink amide-MBHA resin (0.3 mmol) was treated
with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) to remove Fmoc protecting group. Fmoc-Pro-OH pre-activated with
HATU (3 equiv), HOAt (3 equiv), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, 6 equiv) was coupled to the resin.
After removal of Fmoc protecting group, Fmoc-Leu-aldehyde synthesized
per published procedures (10 equiv), was coupled to the resin by reductive
amination in the presence of excess sodium cyanoborohydride (33 equiv)
in 5 mL DMF (1% acetic acid). Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH,
Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-d-Phe-OH
[pre-activated with HATU (3 equiv), HOAt (3 equiv) and DIEA (6 equiv)],
Fmoc-protected pABzA-DIG linker [pre-activated with HATU (3 equiv)
and DIEA (6 equiv)], and DOTA [pre-activated with HATU (3 equiv) and
DIEA (6 equiv)] were coupled to the resin sequentially. The peptide
was deprotected and cleaved from the resin with a cleaving cocktail
of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 81.5%, triisopropylsilane 1%, water
5%, 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) 2.5%, thioanisole 5%, and phenol 5% for
4 h at room temperature. After filtration, the peptide was precipitated
by addition of cold diethyl ether, collected by centrifugation, and
purified by HPLC (semi-preparative column; 23% acetonitrile and 0.1%
TFA in water, flow rate: 4.5 mL/min). The isolated yield was 1.1%.
Retention time: 11.0 min. ESI-MS: calculated [M + H]+ for
ProBOMB1 C79H113N20O19, 1645.8; found, 1645.8.

Synthesis of NeoBOMB1
NeoBOMB1 was
synthesized on solid-phase
using Fmoc-based approach. BAL resin (1% DVB, 0.3 mmol) was swelled
in DMF, drained, and activated by shaking for 10 min in 4 mL of 47.5:47.5:5
methanol/DMF/acetic acid solution. 2,6-Dimethylheptane-4-amine (10
equiv) in 2 mL of 1:1 methanol/DMF solution was added and the mixture
was shaken for 1 h. Sodium cyanoborohydride (10 equiv) was added,
and the mixture was shaken for 16 h. The reaction vial was drained
and washed with dichloromethane and DMF. Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH (3 equiv)
preactivated with HATU (3 equiv), HOAt (3 equiv) and DIEA (8 equiv)
in DMF (6 mL) was then added to the reaction vial and shaken for at
least 1 h. Fmoc-deprotection was performed using 20% piperidine in
DMF. Using a similar procedure, Fmoc-Gly-OH (HATU and HOAt substituted
by HBTU and HOBt), Fmoc-Val-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH,
Fmoc-d-Phe-OH, Fmoc-protected pABzA-DIG linker, and DOTA
were subsequently coupled to the peptide sequence. The peptide was
cleaved with a mixture of 82.5/5/2.5/5/5 TFA/water/EDT/thioanisole/phenol
and purified by HPLC (Agilent 1260 Infinity II Preparative System)
using the preparative column (Gemini 5 μm NX-C18 110 Å,
LC column 50 × 30 mm; 29–30.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA
in water in 10 minutes and held at 30.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA
afterward; flow rate: 30 mL/min). The isolated yield was 39%. Retention
time: 9.0 min. ESI-MS: calculated [M + H]+ for NeoBOMB1
C77H111N18O18, 1575.8;
found, 1576.0.

Synthesis of Nonradioactive Standards
A solution of
ProBOMB1 (1.3 mg, 0.79 μmol) and GaCl3 (0.284 M,
13.9 μL, 3.90 μmol) in 500 μL sodium acetate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 4.2) was incubated at 80 °C for 15 min and purified
by HPLC using the semipreparative column (23% acetonitrile and 0.1%
TFA in water; flow rate: 4.5 mL/min). The isolated yield was 67%.
Retention time: 15.7 min. ESI-MS: calculated [M + H]+ for
Ga-ProBOMB1 C79H110N20O19Ga, 1711.8; found, 1711.7. A solution of NeoBOMB1 (2.0 mg, 1.17 μmol)
and GaCl3 (0.265 M, 47 μL, 12.46 μmol) in 460
μL sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.2) and 60 μL acetonitrile
was incubated at 80 °C for 15 min and purified by HPLC using
the preparative column 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in water; flow
rate: 30 mL/min. The isolated yield was 38%. Retention time: 13.0
min. ESI-MS: calculated [M + H]+ for Ga-NeoBOMB1 C77H109N18O18Ga, 1643.7; found,
1644.0.

Radiolabeling
Purified 68GaCl3 (289–589 MBq, in 0.6 mL water) was added to 0.6 mL of HEPES
buffer (2 M, pH 5.3) containing ProBOMB1 or NeoBOMB1 (25 μg).
The mixture was heated by a microwave oven (Danby DMW7700WDB; power
setting 2; 1 min). HPLC purification was used to separate 68Ga-labeled product from the unlabeled precursor (semipreparative
column; 23% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in water for ProBOMB1; 35% acetonitrile
and 0.1% HCOOH in water for NeoBOMB1; flow rate: 4.5 mL/min). Retention
times: 23.7 min ([68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1); 11.0 min ([68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1). The fraction containing [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1
or [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 was collected, diluted with water
(50 mL), and passed through a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. The [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 or [68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1 trapped on the cartridge
was eluted off with ethanol (0.4 mL) and diluted with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Quality control was performed using the analytical column:
24% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in water ([68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1);
35% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in water ([68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1);
flow rate: 2 mL/min. Retention times: 7.9 min ([68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1);
9.4 min ([68Ga]Ga-NeoBOMB1).

log D7.4 Measurements
log D7.4 values of radiolabeled peptides were measured
using the shake flask method as previously reported.34

Cell Culture
The PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma
cell
line (ATCC-CRL-1435) was cultured in a humidified incubator (5% CO2; 37 °C) in F-12K medium (Life Technologies Corporations)
supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 I.U./mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies).

Competition Binding Assay
The in vitro competition
binding assay was modified from previously published procedures.35 PC-3 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24 well poly-d-lysine plates 18–24
h prior to the experiment. The growth medium was replaced by 400 μL
of reaction medium. Cells were incubated for 30–60 min at 37
°C. Nonradioactive peptides in 50 μL of decreasing concentrations
(10 μM to 1 pM) and 50 μL of 0.011 nM [125I-Tyr4]bombesin were added to wells. The cells were incubated with
moderate agitation for 1 h at 27 °C, washed thrice with ice-cold
PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and measured for activity on the
gamma counter. Data were analyzed using nonlinear regression (one
binding site model for competition assay) with GraphPad Prism 7.

Fluorometric Calcium Release Assay
Calcium release
assays were performed using a FLIPR Calcium 6 assay kit (Molecular
Devices) according to published procedures.36 Briefly, 5 × 104 PC-3 cells were seeded overnight
in 96-well clear bottom black plates. The growth medium was replaced
with loading buffer containing a calcium-sensitive dye and incubated
for 30 min at 37 °C. The plate was placed in a FlexStation 3
microplate reader (Molecular Devices) and baseline fluorescent signals
were acquired for 15 s. Five or 50 nM of Ga-ProBOMB1, [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14),
bombesin, ATP (positive control), or PBS (negative control) was added
to the cells, and the fluorescent signals were acquired for 105 s.
The relative fluorescence unit (RFU = max – min) was used to
determine the agonistic/antagonistic properties.

Animal Model
Animal experiments were approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of the University of British Columbia. Male
NOD.Cg-Rag1tm1Mom Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NRG) mice
obtained from an in-house colony were subcutaneously inoculated with
5 × 106 PC-3 cells (100 μL; 1:1 PBS/Matrigel),
and tumors were grown for 2–3 weeks.

PET/CT Imaging
PC-3 tumor-bearing mice were sedated
(2.5% isoflurane in O2) for i.v. injection of radiotracer
(4.67 ± 0.91 MBq) with or without 100 μg of [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14).
Mice were sedated and scanned (Siemens Inveon microPET/CT) with body
temperature maintained by heating pad. The CT scan was obtained (80
kV; 500 μA; 3 bed positions; 34% overlap; 220° continuous
rotation) followed by a 10 min static PET at 1 or 2 h p.i. of the
radiotracer. PET data were acquired in list mode, reconstructed using
three-dimensional ordered-subsets expectation maximization (2 iterations)
followed by a fast maximum a priori algorithm (18 iterations) with
CT-based attenuation correction. Images were analyzed using the Inveon
Research Workplace software (Siemens Healthineers).

Biodistribution
PC-3 tumor-bearing mice were anesthetized
(2.5% isoflurane in O2) for i.v. injection of radiotracer
(1.84 ± 0.99 MBq) with or without 100 μg of [d-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14]bombesin(6-14).
The mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at 30 min, 1
h, and 2 h p.i. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Organs/tissues
were harvested, rinsed with PBS, blotted dry, and weighed. The activity
in tissues was assayed by gamma counter and expressed as the percentage
injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g).

In Vivo Stability
[68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1 (16.1
± 2.9 MBq) was intravenously injected into two male NRG mice.
After a 5 min uptake period, mice were sedated/euthanized, and blood
was collected. The plasma was isolated and analyzed with radio-HPLC
(24% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in water; flow rate: 2.0 mL/min) following
published procedures.36 Retention time
of [68Ga]Ga-ProBOMB1: 8.8 min.

Dosimetry
Biodistribution
data (% ID/g) were decayed
to the appropriate time-point and fitted to monoexponential or biexponential
models using a Python script developed in-house (Python Software Foundation,
v3.5). The choice of fit was based on R2 and residuals. The resulting time–activity curve was integrated
to obtain the residence time which, multiplied by the model organ
mass (25 g MOBY mouse phantom), provided OLINDA (Hermes Medical Solution,
v2.0) with input values to calculate dosimetry.37,38

Statistical Analysis
The binding affinity was analyzed
with one-way ANOVA with a post hoc t-test on GraphPad
Prism 7. Statistics for biodistribution data were computed using R
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, v.3.4.2). Outliers were identified
with one round of Grubbs’ test (threshold: p < 0.01). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine if
distributions were normal (threshold: p > 0.05);
if they were, Welch’s t-test was used, or
Wilcoxon’s test otherwise. Multiple comparisons were corrected
by Holm’s method.
