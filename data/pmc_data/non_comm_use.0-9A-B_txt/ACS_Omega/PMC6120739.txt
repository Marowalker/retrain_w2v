Poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are targeted therapeutics
with enhanced selectivity and cytotoxicity in BRCA1/2 mutant cancer
cells. AZD2461, a congener of FDA approved olaparib, is a potent PARPi
with high affinity for PARP-1 and nonsubstrate for P-glycoprotein
(P-gp), an attractive characteristic for cancer therapeutics. Analogues
of AZD2461 were synthesized and profiled in BRCA1 functional and nonfunctional
cell lines, revealing compounds (2, 3, and 5) of low cytotoxicity and excellent PARP-1 affinities (∼4–8
nM). In comparison to AZD2461, these agents were found to be less
stimulating of P-gp, suggesting that these compounds may be excellent
candidates for neurological applications where blood brain barrier
penetrance is sought.

Introduction
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
(PARP-1) is an essential nuclear
protein that orchestrates the DNA damage response pathway, making
it an attractive target for cancer therapy, although therapeutic indications
in other disease states are on the horizon.1−3 PARP-1-mediated
cell death, parthanatos, has been defined as a hallmark signature
of neuronal cell death in Parkinson’s disease.4 Additionally, PARP-1 has been shown to propagate the inflammatory
cycle when hyperactivated by reactive oxygen species-induced DNA damage
by rapidly catalyzing PAR which promotes NF-κB signal transduction.4 For these reasons, pharmacological inhibition
of PARP-1 may serve as a therapeutic strategy for slowing disease
progression of inflammatory related illnesses.

While there is
a strong rationale for the development of PARP inhibitors
(PARPi) as anti-inflammatory agents for neurodegenerative disorders,
there lacks reports of drugs within this class that are central nervous
system (CNS) penetrant and noncytotoxic. Currently, three PARP inhibitors,
olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib (Figure 1), are FDA approved to treat patients with
ovarian or breast cancer expressing BRCA mutations or as maintenance
therapy in platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients.1,5,6 However, these drugs are not CNS
penetrant and are also cytotoxic because of the respective intrinsic
anticancer mechanisms of each compound.3 Recently, we demonstrated how the cytotoxic properties of olaparib
can be greatly reduced when replacing piperazine with a 2,6-diazaspiro[3.3]heptane
core;7 however, the CNS uptake of this
analogue is still under investigation. Therefore, it is important
to understand why PARPis are not CNS penetrant and whether PARPis
can be developed with reduced DNA damaging properties.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
known PARPi.

In 2008, Jonkers and
co-workers reported tumor-bearing mice to
be nonresponsive to long-term treatment with olaparib because of upregulation
of Abcb1a and Abcb1b, genes responsible for encoding P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) drug efflux pumps.8 This acquired
drug resistance was reversed through administration of tariquidar,
a P-gp inhibitor, illustrating a potential strategy to combat P-gp-related
resistant mechanisms observed with anticancer agents. AstraZeneca
then developed AZD2461 (Figure 1), a structurally similar analogue of olaparib with lower
enzyme–substrate affinity for P-gp.3 Oplustil O’Connor and co-workers identified AZD2461 to be
less sensitive to drug resistance mechanisms than olaparib, as AZD2461
was more tolerable when combined with chemotherapeutics in mice, suggesting
that this compound may be a promising anticancer agent in future clinical
applications.9 Akin to veliparib and BGB-290,10 AZD2461 is considered a poor substrate for P-gp,
a desirable characteristic for CNS penetrating drugs, and can also
be evaluated in various neurological applications associated with
PARP-1 hyperactivation such as neuroinflamation,11 neurodegeneration,12 neuroimaging,13,14 and even drug addiction.15−17

Because of the unique pharmacological
profile of AZD2461, we set
out to investigate if incorporating other nitrogen-containing and
cycloalkyl ring systems with a methoxy functional group into the phthalazine
architecture would result in a PARPi with increased PARP-1 affinity,
reduced cytotoxicity, or decreased P-gp activity. Here, we report
the synthesis, PARP-1 binding profiles, cell kill properties in using
BRCA1-functional, and nonfunctional cell lines, as well as P-gp interactions
of AZD2461 analogues 2–10. Select compounds appear
to behave less as P-gp substrates than AZD2461, affording potential
therapeutics for neurological applications related to PARP-1 overexpression.

Results
and Discussion
Compounds 2–10 were readily
synthesized through
amide coupling with commercially available precursor 1 and the respective amines, outlined in Scheme 1. It should be noted that compound 1 can also be accessed following previously reported literature
conditions.18−20 In most cases, the illustrated reaction conditions
afforded good-to-moderate yields of the desired products. The trans
and cis steroisomers (7 and 8, respectively)
of compound 6 were also synthesized to examine the pharmacological
properties of each isomer.

Amine, HOBt Hydrate, Triethylamine,
Ethylcarbodiimide Hydrochloride, Tetrahydrofuran, 60 °C, 12 h
Following our previously reported
PARP-1 radioligand binding protocol,21 compounds 2–10 were evaluated
for enzymatic inhibition with BRCA1 methylated ovarian cancer cells
(OVCAR8), outlined in Table 1. In comparison to both AZD2461 and olaparib, a slight decrease
in PARP-1 affinity was observed when incorporating 3-methoxyazetidine
(2), asymmetric ring systems 3-methoxypyrrolidine (3), and 4-methoxyazepane (5) into the phthalazine
ligand scaffold. PARP-1 inhibition was further reduced when examining
cycloalkyl systems in scaffold 6–10, affording
PARP-1 IC50 values between 20 and 226 nM. Compound 6, identified by 1H NMR (see Supporting Information) as a 1:5 mixture of stereoisomers 7 (trans) and 8 (cis), was the most promising
PARPi in this cycloalkyl series, with a PARP-1 IC50 of
43.8 nM. Thus, we evaluated each geometrical isomer of 6 and identified trans congener (7) be the more active
species with a PARP-1 IC50 value of 20.8 nM, compared with
the 107.2 nM enzyme affinity of 8. Although the six-membered
ring, 4-methoxypiperidine, in AZD2461 results in a potent PARPi (4, PARP-1 IC50 = 2.8 nM), we found 4-methoxycyclohexan-1-amine
to be a poor substitute, affording the least potent analogue in this
study (10), with a PARP-1 IC50 value of 226.3
nM.

our previously reported radioligand-binding methodology.21 Dose–response curves were produced to
calculate 50% maximum inhibition values (IC50) where n = 3.

Computational
modeling was conducted with olaparib, 4, 2, 7, and 8 inside the PARP-1
catalytic domain. These in silico studies indicated a clear trend
between the binding profiles of the selected compounds, and the distance
between the methoxy oxygen atom of the ligand and the ARG878 residue
in the PARP-1 binding pocket (Table 2). For example, the oxygen atom in ligand 7, which exhibited a PARP-1 IC50 value of 20.8 nM, had
a calculated distance of 3.9 Å from ARG878, compared with the
5.4 Å value observed with the cis-isomer (8), a
compound with a binding profile of 226.3 nM. The average binding energies
of the compounds were also found to be consistent with the enzymatic
inhibition data observed in vitro as well. This docking study provides
insight into the contrasting PARP-1 binding properties obtained in
vitro with 7 and stereoisomer 8, despite
the similar ligand architectures of these compounds. Docking poses
illustrated in Figure 2 further highlight the unique chemical space the nitrogen ring in
ligand 8 occupies in the binding pocket of the enzyme,
compared with the nitrogen rings of the more potent PARPi in this
study which are found to be more proximal to ARG878.

Anti-proliferative properties of
olaparib, and compounds 2–10 were then analyzed
in BRCA1-null/restored
UWB1.289 isogenic cell lines (Table 3). In the BRCA1-null model, a highly
sensitized cell line for PARPi, we found 2, 3, and 5 to be less cytotoxic than both AZD2461 and olaparib,
despite the comparable PARP-1 IC50 values of each agent.
Surprisingly, all compounds reported showed decreased cytotoxicity
to olaparib and AZD2461. This is consistent with the PARP-1 trapping
theory where PARPis have differential ability to trap PARP-1 irregardless
to high catalytic inhibitory properties.22−24

After restoring
the BRCA1 deficiency in the UWB1.289
cell line, all agents, including olaparib and AZD2461, were found
to be much less cytotoxic when compared with the antiproliferative
properties of these compounds in the in BRCA1-null
model. The general increase in EC50 values observed for
these compounds, including olaparib and AZD2461, with UWB1.289 BRCA1-restored cells, highlights the synthetic lethality
of PARPi in repair-deficient BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated cancers.25−27

Overexpression of multidrug resistance pumps,
such as the drug
transporter P-gp, has been shown to be a possible PARPi resistance
mechanism in cancer cells.3 This also prevents
PARPis from being used as anti-inflammatory agents in neurodegenerative
disorders. Because AZD2461 is described as a non-P-gp substrate, we
evaluated each compound for P-gp activity to assess if decreasing
or increasing the ring size in the AZD2461 ligand architecture could
further alleviate interactions with the plasma membrane protein. This
study was conducted by incubating each compound with recombinant human
P-gp, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent drug efflux pump.
Compounds acting as substrates for P-gp, such as positive control
Verapamil, result in lower signal intensity because of an increase
of ATP consumption by P-gp ATPase (Figure 3). In contrast, inhibitors of P-gp, such
as Na3VO4 (sodium orthovanadate), afford an
increase in luminescence because of the light-generating reaction
from the unmetabolized ATP and firefly luciferase. Our data suggest
that olaparib acts more of a P-gp ATPase activator, than 4, coinciding with previous reports illustrating AZD2461 to be a poorer
substrate of P-gp, when compared with the FDA-approved congener.

Figure 3 Luminescence
generated with olaparib, 2–10,
Na3VO4, and Verapamil. Verapamil, a substrate
for P-gp that stimulates P-gp ATPase activity resulting in decreased
luminescence, was utilized as a positive control. Increase in luminescence
results from the light-generating reaction from luciferase and unmetabolized
ATP. Unconsumed ATP indicates a decrease in P-gp ATPase stimulation,
rendering the compound as a P-gp inhibitor. Data are normalized to
known P-gp inhibitor Na3VO4.

An increase in luminescence was observed with AZD2461
analogues
containing nitrogen ring systems (2, 3,
and 5), suggesting that these compounds can be suitable
candidates for neuroinflammation investigative studies, where blood–brain-barrier
(BBB) penetrance is sought. Compounds 3 and 5 were the weakest activators of P-gp ATPase, suggesting that these
poor cytotoxic PARPi can be useful for neurological applications,
such as neuroinflammation, where PARP-1 inhibition and brain penetrance
are more desirable than cell kill. Compound 6 was identified
as the only P-gp substrate in this study, resulting in luminescence
that was comparable to known P-gp substrate Verapamil. Similar to 3, compound 9 also appeared to be a poor activator
of P-pg ATPase, suggesting that P-gp interactions may be less-favorable
with five-membered ring systems in the AZD2461 ligand architecture.

Conclusions
In summary, we identified three AZD2461 analogues which exhibited
impressive PARP-1 IC50 values of less than 10 nM (2, 3, and 5), which however exhibited
poor antiproliferative effects in BRCA1-restored
UWB1.289 cell lines, in contrast to olaparib and AZD2461. Nitrogen-containing
ring systems in 2–5 afforded PARPi with increased
PARP-1 affinity, compared to the decreased enzymatic inhibition observed
with ligands containing cycloalkyl rings systems (6–10). In silico studies revealed a clear correlation among the binding
profiles of the ligands and distance calculated between the methoxy
oxygen atom in the ligand and the ARG878 residue in the PARP-1 binding
pocket. These data provide reasoning to the contrasting PARP-1 IC50 values obtained with 7 and geometrical isomer 8. Compounds containing five-membered methoxy rings (3 and 9) were found to be the least activating
agents of P-gp ATPase in this study, suggesting that these PARPis
may be less prone to drug efflux in cells. Furthermore, these compounds
may also be interesting candidates for therapeutic applications in
neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration where cytotoxicity is not desired
and minimal P-gp interactions are needed to cross the BBB.
