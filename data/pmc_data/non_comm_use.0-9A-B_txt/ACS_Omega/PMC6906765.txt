Printed systems spark immense interest in industry, and for several
parts such as solar cells or radio frequency identification antennas,
printed products are already available on the market. This has led
to intense research; however, printed field-effect transistors (FETs)
and logics derived thereof still have not been sufficiently developed
to be adapted by industry. Among others, one of the reasons for this
is the lack of control of the threshold voltage during production.
In this work, we show an approach to adjust the threshold voltage
(Vth) in printed electrolyte-gated FETs
(EGFETs) with high accuracy by doping indium-oxide semiconducting
channels with chromium. Despite high doping concentrations achieved
by a wet chemical process during precursor ink preparation, good on/off-ratios
of more than five orders of magnitude could be demonstrated. The synthesis
process is simple, inexpensive, and easily scalable and leads to depletion-mode
EGFETs, which are fully functional at operation potentials below 2
V and allows us to increase Vth by approximately
0.5 V.

Introduction
Because of an increasing interest in printed devices utilized in
a variety of applications for the “Internet of Things”,
research efforts in this field have been rapidly growing in the last
decade leading to substantial advances in the field. Several components,
such as printed radio frequency identification (RFID) antennas, printed
organic light emitting diodes, printed displays, or printed solar
cells, have already been in use for many years by now or are on the
verge to replace their traditionally produced analogs. For other components
and devices, especially printed logics, it has not yet been possible
to fulfill the requirements in synthesis and processing and in properties
of the printed materials for a transfer to industrial use.1 There are many issues in the way of reaching
this level, including low-temperature processability, use of low-cost
materials, applicability to flexible substrates, tailorability of
properties of the active materials, long-term stability, and reliability
of yield and properties, to name a few. The complexity of printed
field-effect transistor (FET) devices and the sensitivity of their
properties with printing process changes can be seen as a major hurdle
when it comes to the last point: the necessity to print many devices
with predictable and reliable performance parameters as the basis
for circuits. Therefore, on a device level, the active and passive
parts would greatly benefit from a possibility to be individually
tailored toward their performance parameters to adapt to the complete
printed device or circuit. One of these performance parameters is
the threshold voltage (Vth), which indicates
the transition of an electrically insulating channel (off-state) to
an electrically conducting channel (on-state) after a sufficient gate
potential is applied. To tailor the semiconducting channel regarding
a defined Vth, several approaches can
be used, including the utilization of different channel materials,
different thicknesses or permittivities of the dielectric, organic
monolayered dielectrics, adjusted surface carrier densities, or channel
layouts, that is, aspect ratios.2−7 Another prominent method to control the Vth is chemical doping of the channel material in order to change its
electronic band structure.8−10

To adapt to the demands of low power applications, printed electronic
circuits, which are operational at low potentials, are required. Printed
electrolyte-gated FETs (EGFETs) can fulfill such specifications because
the electrolyte gating paired with an indium oxide semiconducting
channel renders the device operational at working potentials below
2 V. These inorganic printed transistors have been proven to be reliable
and to show remarkable performances.11 Additionally,
studies on indium tin oxide (ITO) have shown that the electrical properties
of In2O3 can be well adjusted using dopants.
Doping In2O3 with chromium is known to form
a stable single-phase system in thin films for up to 15 at. % of Cr
(relative to In).12,13 In addition Cr:In2O3 has been intensively studied as a possible dilute magnetic
semiconductor candidate material.14−16

In the present work, we report on wet-chemistry processing of Cr:In2O3 channels in EFGETs and demonstrate that the Vth of single transistors can be tailored. The
new and simple processing technology toward printed electronics provides
the basis for more complex circuit designs. The doping concept has
been applied to a well-established production process for the preparation
of in-plane, indium oxide-based, EGFETs resulting in a reliable and
predictable increase of Vth from −0.63
to −0.15 V with increasing dopant concentrations.

Results and Discussion
The focus of the current research is on the tailoring of Vth in FET devices by doping of the In2O3 channels with chromium. A series of six different chromium
dopant concentrations, listed in Table 1, was examined.

Table 1 Cr-Doping Contents as Atom Percentage
of Cations in the Channel Material
composition	dopant content (corresponding sample names) (%)	
In2O3	0	
In1.95Cr0.05O3	2.5	
In1.90Cr0.10O3	5.0	
In1.85Cr0.15O3	7.5	
In1.80Cr0.20O3	10.0	
In1.75Cr0.25O3	12.5	
The experiments were performed using in-plane EGFETs with displaced
gate design and channel lengths and widths of 50 μm and approximately
100 μm, respectively. The preparation followed an established
process for pure In2O3 channels, simply replacing
pure In2O3 by the doped compounds.17 The doping was performed by creating mother
solutions of pure In(NO3)3, pure Cr(NO3)3, and pure solvent mixed in the appropriate volume ratios.
The gating relies on a composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE),
well-known and thoroughly examined by our group, and electrical testing
has been performed at room temperature and constant humidity.18 Detailed descriptions of each production step
and the measurements can be found in the experimental part. A schematic
of the overall process and a microscopic view of a typical FET are
shown in the Supporting Information (Figures
S1 and S2).

To ensure a controlled doping process, the as-synthesized materials
were characterized via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As can be seen
in the XRD-patterns (Figure 1a), a single-phase is observed even at higher dopant concentrations.

Figure 1 Powder XRD patterns of the channels for 0–12.5% Cr:In2O3, (a) patterns in the range of 20° to 55°,
and (b) magnification of the (222) reflexes in the range of 28°
to 33° for better visibility of the shifts; reference pattern
of In2O3: ICSD 169420.

While the positions of reflexes for the pure In2O3 sample match the database reference pattern, shifting of
all reflexes toward larger angles is observed with increased Cr-concentrations,
which indicates a smaller lattice parameter coinciding with the decreased
ionic radius of Cr3+ and Cr2+ compared to In3+ (Cr3+ ≈ 62 pm, Cr2+ ≈
80 pm, and In3+ ≈ 92 pm).19 In Figure 1b, this
shift is clarified for the (222) reflexes. With this continuous shift
and no secondary phase found in any of the doped samples, a homogeneous
substitution of In by Cr in the crystal system can be assumed. Consequently,
any changes in electrical behavior are most likely resulting from
doping effects.

For each doping concentration, ten FETs were produced and device
characteristics were measured for all functional devices. Nonfunctional
devices arose from printing errors, leading to the channel material
short circuiting with the gate electrode. Final set sizes range from
5 to 10 devices. To exclude any electrochemical side reactions and
to show the functionality at low voltages, both gate (VGS) and drain (VDS) voltages
were kept below 2 V. In Figure 2, output and transfer curves of both an FET with an undoped
and one with a highly Cr-enriched channel, respectively, are shown.
We assume the hysteresis behavior to arise from mainly two factors,
surface trap states and the comparably slow ion mobility in the CSPE
lagging behind the VGS sweeping speed.
Notably the negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior, that
is, visible bumps, in the output characteristics increases. Imperfect
contacts between the channel and leads or internal material defects
are often assumed to be the cause for trap states resulting in NDR.20 Because of the production approach, the channel
films are not monocrystalline, so many grain boundaries which are
prone to lattice defects—and thus resulting trap states—exist.
Additionally, the Cr-atoms can be assumed to further disturb the lattice
and add more trap states. In both cases, diode behavior becomes apparent
at VDS > 1.5 V. As the output currents
saturate before that and good ID,on is
given at VGS = 1.5 V in the transfer curves,
limiting the operation voltages to 1.5 V in future applications should
be considered.

Figure 2 (a,b) output and transfer curves for undoped indium oxide and (c,d)
output and transfer curves for 12.5% Cr-doping; transfer curves are
measured at VDS = 2 V.

The device characteristics for other dopant concentrations can
be found in the Supporting Information (Figures
S3–S6): in all cases a typical FET-behavior is given. Notably
all gate (leakage) currents (IG) are in
the range of −11.0 to 7.0 nA and doping has no systematic influence
on their behavior, as shown in Figure 3 by an overlay of leakage currents for FETs with different
Cr-doping concentrations. Most importantly, Vth levels continuously shift to higher values.

Figure 3 Overlay of leakage behavior for devices at each doping concentration.

An extensive study on Cr:In2O3 has been done
by Wang et al. showing that Cr is mostly present in the Cr2+-state and as such compensates the oxygen vacancies, which leads
to lower carrier concentrations effectively being a hole doping process.21 A direct influence of carrier concentrations
on the threshold voltage has been observed in many FETs with metal
oxide channels.22−24

Threshold voltages Vth of all devices
have been extracted exploiting the direct correlation ID1/2 ∝ (VGS – Vth) given in eq 2 as derived from the standard metal-oxide
semiconductor field-effect transistor equation eq 1 in the saturation regime (i.e. VDS > VGS – Vth), where VDS and VGS are drain and gate voltages, W and L, the gate width and length, Cch,ar, the areal capacitance of the channel, and ID the drain current, respectively. Vth is given as the value of VGS at ID = 0 for the fit to the linear
region of the square rooted output currents in the transfer curves
(Figure 2b,d). In all
cases, the forward curves of the transfer curve hystereses have been
used. 1   2  

The obtained values for Vth are shown
in Figure 4a. As can
be seen, the threshold voltages linearly increase with increasing
dopant concentrations, and the regression coefficient of the linear
fit is close to 1, that is, a direct correlation between Vth and Cr-doping is observed. The increase in Vth at each doping step has been statistically
analyzed, as described in the experimental part, and all neighboring
sets are independent at a 95% confidence interval. On average, the
threshold voltage is shifted by approx +0.5 V from −0.63 to
−0.15 V between 0 and 12.5% Cr-doping. Along with this, ID,on and ID,off show
a general decrease but not with as strict linearity as for the threshold
voltages. This can be explained with a larger variation in the channel
widths arising from different spreading behavior of the ink between
the source and drain leads, as can be seen in the two example devices
in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. In general, the on-currents for the highest doped samples are approximately
reduced to 40% relative to the undoped samples. All but three devices
span five orders of magnitude in the ID,on/ID,off-ratio. A full list of all values
for Vth, ID,on, and ID,off of each device can be found
in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Substhreshold slopes for all devices have been determined as the
maximum slope below these Vth. They are
in the range of 90–210 mV/dec without any systematic dependence
on the doping.

Figure 4 (a) Values for Vth for all devices
with insets (b,c) as magnifications of the sets with 0 and 10% doping,
respectively and (d) corresponding values of ID,on and ID,off.

In Figure 5a, a
comparison of the output curves for one device from each doping concentration
at a gate bias of 2 V is shown on a linear scale. As can be seen,
the currents decrease with increased doping of the channel material
but are still in the same order of magnitude. The trend in the currents
can mainly be traced back to two aspects: on the one hand eq 1 can be regarded. With Vth increasing, the factor (VGS – Vth)2—and thus ID—will be reduced.
With the average Vth change from −0.63
to −0.15 V and the given gate voltage of 2 V, this factor alone
can account for a 33% decrease in ID,on between the undoped and 12.5% Cr-doped samples.

Figure 5 (a) output curves at VGS = 2 V and
(b) field-effect mobilities for different Cr-doping concentrations;
the samples in (a) are identical to the ones in Figures 2 and S3–S6.

On the other hand, the increasing dopant concentration will introduce
more scattering centers into the semiconductor, well known from the
literature to lower the field-effect mobility μFET.12,25,26 To prove this
effect in our devices, the field-effect mobilities of two transistors
of each doping batch have been determined using eq 3 which is derived from eq 1.27x is already given in eq 2 as the slope of the linear fit used for determining Vth. This approach is numerically more stable in comparison
to using extracted values for ID,sat and Vth in eq 1 because instead of numerically finding two single point values,
the slope relies on a fit to a large range of measurement points and
a least squares optimization. The specific areal channel capacitances
have been extracted from capacitor measurements with source and drain
(short circuited) on the one side and gate on the other side as electrodes.
The approach is explained in detail in the Supporting Information. 3  

In Figure 5b, the
trend of decreasing mobilities with increasing Cr-content is clearly
visible. Mobilities shrink by about 60% between the samples with 0
and 12.5% Cr-doping and add another major factor to the loss in ID,on.

When considering applications in larger logical arrays using FETs
with different Vth-values, the simplest
application would be an NMOS-inverter with a load transistor. The
respectively necessary printed FETs with indium oxide channels and
positive threshold voltages are well known systems.17,28 Our approach allows the precise predefinition of the threshold voltage
with very good accuracy.

Outline
Tailoring of the Vth of Cr:In2O3 channels for EFGETs could be achieved by adjusting
the chromium concentration between 0 and 12.5%. A clear trend toward
increased Vth with increased chromium
concentration has been observed, accompanied by a saturation current
decrease of about 60% at the high chromium concentrations. Despite
the limitations of the printing technique, a clear change of Vth with a highly linear character was obtained.
The doping process was conducted using a wet chemical approach, which
can be directly applied in ink-jet printed electronics. Our approach
allows us to almost pinpoint Vth, and
thus, a central parameter in circuit design could be well managed.
On the other hand, the advantage of tailoring Vth occurs at the cost of ID,on;
however, that loss assumingly could be made up by design changes,
for example, increased channel widths. The major advantage of the
current approach is its simplicity, which is of direct interest for
low-cost printed electronics. With the vast variety of possible dopants
for In2O3, this approach promises a full branch
of tailored FET properties in inorganic printed electronics using
simple wet chemical methods.26

Experimental Section
Channel Ink Preparation
Three parent solutions of 0.1
M In(NO3)3·xH2O (99.99% Sigma-Aldrich), 0.025 M Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), in a 4:1-mixture of deionized water
and glycerol, and a solvent-only solution with the same makeup have
been prepared by applying 5 min of ultrasonication (salt solutions
only) followed by at least 30 min of stirring. The final printing
inks have been obtained by mixing the indium parent solution with
varying amounts of the chromium and solvent-only parent solutions
followed by at least 30 min of intense stirring to ensure a homogeneous
distribution of the dopant according to Table 2.

Table 2 Volume Ratios for Different Doping
Concentrations
ink	VIn [mL]	VCr [mL]	Vsolvent [mL]	doping ratio [In:Cr]	nCr/(nCr + nIn) [%]	
1	1	0	1	40:0	0	
2	1	0.1	0.9	40:1	2.5	
3	1	0.2	0.8	40:2	5.0	
4	1	0.3	0.7	40:3	7.5	
5	1	0.4	0.6	40:4	10.0	
6	1	0.5	0.5	40:5	12.5	
Effectively, 2 mL of each ink with a fixed indium concentration
of 0.05 M and varying amounts of the Cr-dopants have been made. The
indium concentration and the solvent mixture has been successfully
applied earlier. The preparation route is a variation of an established
method for undoped In2O3 channels.17

Device Production
For creating the passive structures,
commercially available glass substrates with sputtered ITO coating
(pgo GmbH, R ≤ 20 Ω/□) were taken
as the basis and structured using a TRUMPF TruMicro 5000 laser ablation
system. Coating removal was done at a laser frequency of 800 MHz and
a power of 3 W in a grid pattern. Before printing, all substrates
were thoroughly cleaned by 5 min of ultrasonication in iPrOH followed by rinsing twice with water and iPrOH
and blow-drying.

The channel inks were applied with a Dimatix
DMP 2831 materials printer system using cartridges with 10 pL nozzles.
Printing was done on the day of ink preparation using four layers
of ink at a drop spacing of 30 μm. Annealing was done in a box
furnace. During this process, the devices were heated to 400 °C
within 2 h, kept at this temperature for 2 h, and cooled down to room
temperature overnight.

The substrates of reference samples without a channel for capacitance
measurement underwent the same temperature treatment before being
printed with the electrolyte.

In the last step, eight layers of the CSPE were applied with the
same printing system, and the FETs were allowed to dry for about 2
h before measurement.

Composite Solid Polymer Electrolyte
The CSPE was prepared
using an established method of this group:18 0.3 g of poly(vinylalcohol) is dissolved in 6 g of DMSO under stirring
at 80 °C. A separate solution of 70 mg of LiClO4 was
solved in 0.63 g of propylene carbonate under stirring. Once fully
dissolved, the polyvinyl alcohol solution is added to the salt solution
and stirred overnight at 60 °C. The resulting clear liquid is
filtered through 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filters and then directly
used in the printing.

Reference Powders and XRDs
Approx. 1 mL of each solution
was placed in glass Petri dishes and received the same temperature
treatment as the channels: heating to 400 °C in 2 h, level keeping
for 2 h, and cooling down overnight. After cooling, the powders were
scratched off and powder XRD-patterns were measured with a Bruker
D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using copper Kα radiation.

Device Characterization
Electrical measurements were
done on a SUSS MicroTec MLC-150C probe station with an Agilent 4156C
precision semiconductor parameter analyzer as a measuring unit. Transfer
curves were measured at fixed drain voltages of 2.0 V and a gate voltage
sweep of −1.0 to 2.0 V, and output curves at fixed gate voltages
of −0.4 to 2.0 V in 0.4 V steps and a drain voltage sweep of
0.0–2.0 V. Capacitances have been measured by short-circuiting
the source and drain leads and keeping them at 0.0 V, while sweeping
the gate voltage from −1.0 to 2.0 V.

Statistical Analysis
Shapiro–Wilk tests for
normal distribution have been performed on each set and F- and t-tests for neighboring sets, where the t-test has been chosen according to the result of the F-test. All tests were run as implemented in the R programming
language version 3.5.2 with a confidence level of 95%.29

The correlation coefficient has been extracted
with gnuplot, which was also used for creating all graphs in this
work.30
