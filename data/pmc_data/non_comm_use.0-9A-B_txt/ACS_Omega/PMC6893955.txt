Here,
we have studied, with a combined experimental and computational
approach, the effect of the crystal environment and aggregation on
the electronic properties of Pigment Red 179, which affect both its
color and optical energy gap. Spectra acquired in the near-infrared
and visible range of energies suggest that this molecule is indeed
a “cool” dye, which can be employed as a red pigment
that provides effective color coverage to different substrates without
contributing to their heating during light irradiation. Spectra acquired
on different polymer mixtures at different pigment concentrations
(i.e., 2.5–10 wt %) suggest that absorption features depend
on chromophoric arrangements promoted by the strong intermolecular
π–π interactions. Calculations, performed at the
time-dependent density functional theory level, allowed to both attribute
the nature of the electronic transitions causing the observed spectra
involved and understand the effect of the environment. Indeed, the
visible spectra of the pigment is dominated by two localized transitions,
with negligible charge transfer for both a dye monomer and dimer either
in vacuum or acetonitrile solution. Instead, models including the
crystal environment of the pigment show the presence of a high-wavelength
S1 ← S0 charge transfer transition between
two adjacent molecules, in quantitative agreement with the experimental
absorption energy of the crystal pigment.

==== Body
Introduction
Nowadays, it is widely
accepted that human activities strongly
contribute to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, with metropolitan
areas significantly warmer than surrounding country areas.1−3 Urban areas are densely populated, thus contributing to average
and peak energy demands especially during summer and straining energy
resources mainly based on fossil fuels still today. In EU countries,
buildings account for 40% of final energy demand and 32% of CO2 emission, including residential, industrial, and service
sectors.4 With the stringent need for increasing
energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emission, improving
the energy performance of Europe’s building stock is mandatory.
Nevertheless, the EU renovation rate (1.2% in EU) is slower than expected
and Kyoto and Paris agreement targets reasonably appear out of reach
as also mentioned in the 2010/31/EU Directive, which states that each
new building should be made “nearly zero energy” from
2020 onward. An accessible solution to comply with the EU regulation
and to mitigate the UHI effect is mimicking the NIR transparent and
reflective features of plants and leaves by coating the building surfaces
with cool pigments.5,6

When the sunlight shines
onto a material, part of the radiation
is absorbed, thus heating its surface. This is caused by 52% of the
electromagnetic spectrum of light composed by the near-infrared (NIR)
window (i.e., from 700 to 2500 nm) that promotes chemical bond vibration,
thus provoking temperature increase.7 Heat
is then transported by conduction into the material, elevating the
temperature of the internal side by convection. It is already reported
that cool pigments and coatings are able to reduce the heating effect
of sunlight with corresponding temperature differences > 10 °C,
therefore reducing the electricity demand and saving energy required
to downgrade the UHI phenomenon.8,9 Cool surfaces are measured
considering the amount of NIR radiation they reflect (solar reflectance)
and how rapidly and efficiently they dissipate heat (thermal emittance).10 NIR reflective pigments are categorized as cool
pigments, which are nowadays dominated by inorganic compounds such
as chromium and rare-earth oxides, thanks to their higher refractive
indexes, but affected by evident toxicity issues.8 Titanium dioxide is also reported as an effective reflector
of vis–NIR light but it strongly absorbs UV light, thus also
promoting potential degradation of the organic coating. Therefore,
organic cool pigments are an object of growing interest owing to their
safe properties, low cost, and very good processability and dispersibility
in most of the polymeric formulations.

Among all available organic
pigments, perylene bis-imide derivatives
represent the most investigated cool components of organic coatings
thanks to their light and thermal stability, dispersion properties
in polymers, and color modulation in the visible region thanks to
the different functionalizations at the peripheral positions of the
perylene nucleus.11−16

The NIR transparent and potential reflective properties of
perylenes
have been investigated in the literature and attributed to different
parameters, such as pigment particle size, crystallinity, and dipole
moment of the chromophoric supramolecular structure.17,18

Nevertheless, certain cool perylene bisimide pigments still
lack
full investigation aimed to determine the influence of their aggregation
extent on the vis–NIR optical features of the derived polymer
coatings. These properties are thus of paramount relevance for current
and prospective applications and are deeply rooted into the molecular
geometry, environment, and electronic structure of ground and excited
states. Color, in particular, may depend in general on the molecular
environments around the chromophores and, as it has been shown, on
their aggregation state.18 Therefore, a
deep understanding of the effects induced by the aggregation on the
optoelectronic properties of dyes is needed to fine-tune them for
application where light–matter interactions are relevant. In
this regard, computational modeling at the quantum level (QM) can
give unique insights on the mechanism behind aggregation-induced optical
processes, both qualitative and quantitative.19,20 However, most investigations of periodic molecular crystals performed
at the QM level are limited to the simulation of the electronic ground
state, while excited states are often simulated using a user-defined
cluster of molecules extracted from the solid-state structure and
treated often at the time-dependent (TD) density functional theory
level (DFT). This approach, while at times successful, does not consider
the effect of an extended periodic environment properly, thus resulting
in limited predictive and explanatory power. To properly include short-
and long-range electrostatic effects, recently some of us developed
a charge embedding technique enabling to take into account the effect
of the exact Madelung crystal field potential on a small region of
interest treated at the quantum mechanical (QM) level, by a finite
array of fitted point charges. This computationally affordable model
has been proven to correctly simulate the environmental effects in
absorption and emission spectra of molecular crystals.

In this
work, we have combined these theoretical tools with experimental
investigations to understand the optical features upon aggregation
of the N,N′-bis-(methyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyldiimide
dye (hereafter called Pigment Red 179 or PR179, see Figure 1), a perylene-derivative dye
of significant current and prospective relevance. Different coatings
were prepared as a function of the pigment content and their vis–NIR
optical features studied in terms of their supramolecular structure.

We have organized the
paper as follows. In the Experimental Details section, we report the experimental optical
setup used to probe of PR179 in both solution and solid states. In
the Computational Details section, we describe
the adopted DFT and TD-DFT procedure. In the Results
and Discussion section, we present the collected chemical and
physical data analyzing and commenting them. Finally, in the Concluding Remarks section, we discuss the main
findings of this paper and how they can be relevant for the field
of light–matter interaction.

Experimental Details
Materials
Pigment Red 179 was obtained from BASF and
utilized as received. Disperbyk 2015 (solution of a structured acrylate
copolymer with pigment-affinic groups) was obtained from BYK USA Inc.
Polidisp (acrylic acid esters and styrene copolymer dispersion, 50%
solid content, glass transition temperature of 18 °C) was received
from Resiquimica. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE, Dowlex SC
2107, Melt flow index, 190 °C/2.16 kg, 2.3 g/10 min, d = 0.917 g/cm3) was supplied by Dow Plastics.
The remaining chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Coating Preparation
To a desired amount of Pigment
Red 179, Disperbyk 2015 (1:1 by weight with respect to the pigment)
and 2 g of the Polidisp acrylic dispersion polymer were added and
mechanically mixed at room temperature until a homogeneous mixture
was obtained. After the addition with 500 μL of deionized water,
the resultant paint was applied to Leneta checkerboard charts or to
cellulose acetate films (3 M AF4300, Write-on Transparency Film) using
a ZUA 2000 Universal Applicator (Zehntner Testing Instruments) to
obtain 60–70 μm thick films after complete water evaporation.
In the case of coatings based on linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE),
a desired amount of Pigment Red 179 was dispersed under vigorous stirring
in a 5 wt % LLDPE solution in toluene. After evaporation of the solvent,
the blend was compression-molded at 180 °C for 5 min into a thin
film of about 200 μm thickness.

Methods
UV–vis–NIR
reflectance measurements
of black- and white-coated surfaces were recorded over the wavelength
range of 300–2500 nm by using an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer
equipped with a 150 mm integration sphere and according to ASTM E903-12
(the standard test method for solar absorptance, reflectance, and
transmittance of materials using integrating spheres). NIST standards
were utilized as primary standards for the calibration of instrument.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D2
Phaser diffractometer (30 kV, 10 mA) operating in Bragg–Brentano
geometry (θ–θ scan mode) and equipped with a one-dimensional
Lynxeye detector. Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation was used. Data
were collected in the scan range of 4–70° in 2θ,
with a scan step of 0.018° and count time of 0.5 s/step. Data
were processed through the software Diffrac.Eva (Bruker AXS).

The thickness of the coating layer was measured with a CM1S dial
indicator (Borletti, Milan, Italy) with ruby movement bearing.

A commercially available 100 W IR lamp (Kerbl, Buchbach, Germany)
was used for the heating tests. The specimens were irradiated at a
distance of 20 cm for 15 min, and then the temperature measured by
means of an FLIR E6 infrared thermocamera (FLIR, Wilsonville, OR).

The optical microscope analysis was accomplished on a Reichert
Polyvar optical microscope with crossed polarizers. Particle analysis
was performed using the public domain ImageJ 1.52k software version
image analyzer program developed by the National Institutes of Health
and available on the internet at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html.

Computational Details
Nonembedded Calculations
PR179 has
been studied here
by means of DFT structural ground-state optimization in vacuo with
the B3LYP21,22 functional using the Gaussian software (development
version: ES64L-GDVRevI.12+23). To model
dispersion forces, we adopted Grimme’s D3-BJ correction24 (keyword GD3BJ in the Gaussian software). All
relaxed structures are actual potential energy minima, as checked
by harmonic frequency calculations (i.e., all normal modes have a
positive frequency). Using the relaxed ground-state structure, vertical
excitations have been computed at the TD-DFT level, with the PBE0,25,26 LC-PBE,27 and CAM-B3LYP28 functionals: these exchange-correlation functionals have
been chosen to span both global hybrid (PBE0) and range-separated
hybrid ones (LC-PBE, CAM-B3LYP), which often provide a more reliable
description of through space charge-transfer excitations. Calculations
at the PBE0 and LC-PBE level are reported in Figures S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information. These calculations
were performed both in vacuum and simulating interactions with the
nonprotic polar solvent (acetonitrile, ACN), using an implicit solvent
model (polarizable continuum model, the Gaussian default IEFPCM).29 The results of solvent calculations are reported
in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information.

Periodic and Embedded TDDFT Calculations
All periodic
calculations have been carried out with the Crystal 1730 code at the B3LYP-D3 level, as for the isolated
species, along with a modified all-electron 6-31+G(d,p) basis set
omitting the most diffuse functions. Numerical DFT integration has
been performed considering 75 radial points and 974 angular points,
ensuring an error on the integrated electron density to an accuracy
of 10–5 e per unit cell. The Coulomb and exchange
series were truncated with threshold values of 10–7, 10–7, 10–7, 10–7, and 10–21. A tolerance of 10–7 au has been used for the convergence of the self-consistent field
procedure. Cell parameters and atomic positions have been relaxed
during geometry optimization. Convergence was determined from the
root mean square and absolute value of the largest component of the
forces and displacements, considering default values (0.00045 and
0.00067 au for the forces, and 0.0018 and 0.0027 au for the displacements,
respectively). The crystalline structure of PR179 belongs to the monoclinic P21/c space group, with flat perylenetetracarboxylicdiimide
portions packed in stacks through π–π interactions,
with experimental lattice parameters of a = 3.874(1)
Å, b = 15.580(2) Å, and c = 14.597(2) Å, β = 97.65(2)°. The optimized lattice
parameters obtained are a = 3.715 Å, b = 15.535 Å, c = 14.193 Å, and
β = 100.50°. In addition, the flat portions of neighboring
molecules are found 3.75 Å apart, with respect to an experimental
value of 3.87 Å. To create a more cubiclike box, we adopted a
4 × 1 × 1 monoclinic supercell, resulting in a simulation
box of volume ∼14.9 × 15.5 × 14.2 Å3, shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information.

Starting from the optimized crystal structure obtained,
a large supercell was built and partitioned into three zones, according
to the SC-Ewald approach.31 At the inner
first zone treated at the QM level, four different clusters with either
one, two, three or four PR179 molecules have been considered. The
intermediate second zone consisted of point charges fixed at the value
of the Mulliken atomic charges of the periodic calculation, while
the point charge values of the outer third zone have been adjusted
to impose the exact Madelung potential of the infinite periodic system
on the first two zone sites. Further details are available in ref (20) as well as in some of
our previous works.32−36 Vertical TD-DFT calculations with the aforementioned models (embedded
monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer of PR179) have been carried out,
thus including the effects of the crystal environment. The embedded
dimer model was also used to test the dependence of computed spectra
on the intermolecular distance. All calculations (both embedded and
nonembedded) have been carried out using the Pople’s 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set, and dispersion forces were modeled employing Grimme’s
D3-BJ correction.24

Results and Discussion
Experimental
Investigations of Pigment Red 179 (PR179) Dispersions
Properties
of PR179 Dispersions on Opaque Substrates
Vis–NIR
reflectance spectra recorded on PR179 dispersion over
the white portion of Leneta (L) checkerboard chart (Figure 2a) display a reflectance pattern
affected by pigment content, i.e., particularly pronounced up to 1200
nm, and in agreement with the absorption characteristics of the chromophoric
unit.12 Notably, the 10% of reflectance
reduction due to the pigment coating was more pronounced by increasing
the pigment content from 2.5 to 5 wt %. Conversely, no evident variations
actually occurred for the coating containing the highest PR179 content
(10 wt %), thus suggesting that a sufficient coverage of the white
checkboard was reached with the intermediate 5 wt % concentration.

Figure 2 Vis–NIR
reflectance spectra of Pigment Red 179 dispersions
over white (a) and black (b) Leneta (L) checkerboard charts.

Moreover, reflectance values as high as 80% recorded
from white
substrates suggested that Pigment Red 179 is relatively NIR transparent.37−39 This characteristic was confirmed by inspecting the reflectance
behavior of pigment coatings over black substrates (Figure 2b). Relatively low reflectances
were recorded in agreement with the NIR transparent features of Pigment
Red 179. Nevertheless, a worthwhile increase of the overall reflectance
in the 700–1600 nm wavelength window occurred with pigment
concentration. Notably, on passing from 2.5 to 10 wt % of the pigment
concentration, 75% of light reflection was recovered. This behavior
suggests that Pigment Red 179 could also behave as an NIR reflective
molecule, in agreement with certain symmetrically substituted perylene
derivatives.11

NIR reflectivity was
also associated to a cooling effect of the
surface by monitoring the temperature enhancement of the black coated
and uncoated substrates after irradiation with an IR lamp for 15 min
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 Thermographs
of the (a) uncoated, (b) 5 wt %, and (c) 10 wt % Pigment
Red 179 coated black checkboards with the maximum temperature reached
after irradiation with a 100 W IR lamp for 15 min.

It was worth noting that the maximum temperature reached
by the
uncoated black surface (Figure 3a) was recorded as the highest at 61.5 °C, i.e., 2.7
and 4.9 °C higher than those coated by the 5 wt % (Figure 3b) and the 10 wt % (Figure 3c) Pigment Red 179
dispersions, respectively. This performance, while on one hand appears
less pronounced than that of ultimate paints with chilling effects
higher than 10–15 °C, on the other hand confirms the cooling
characteristics of the investigated symmetrically substituted perylene
bisimide derivative.

Aimed at determining the origin of the
cool features of Pigment
Red 179, the dispersions were analyzed by XRD investigations at room
temperature (Figure 4).

Figure 4 XRD spectra of the Pigment Red 179 dispersions at different dye
concentrations.

The XRD pattern of the pigment
dispersions displayed sharp reflections
attributed to the crystalline content that is dominated by an evident
elevation caused by the amorphous phase contribution, which appears
predominant at the lower θ region and mostly attributed to the
acrylic amorphous polymer coating. Notably, the diffraction profiles
in the higher θ regions (θ > 25°) showed crystalline
contributions that are attributed to self-assembled and well-ordered
microstructures promoted by the formations of intermolecular π–π
interactions.16,19 It is worth noting that a considerable
fraction of crystalline Pigment Red 179 is present at all investigated
concentrations with an evident and progressive increase of the reflection
intensities particularly evidenced on passing from the 2.5 to the
5 wt % pigment concentration. Unfortunately, the presence of the strong
amorphous contribution provided by the polymer covered most of the
crystalline peaks of the pigment at the θ region lower than
22°. This issue flanked by experimental systematic errors made
a quantitative assessment of the crystalline degree inaccurate. Nevertheless,
the favorable morphology and crystallinity of π–π
pigment stacked structures possibly explain enhancement in the NIR
reflectivity.

Properties of PR179 Dispersions on Transparent
Substrates
Pigment Red 179 dispersion was also deposited
on transparent cellulose
acetate polymer films aimed at determining the morphology of the pigment
aggregates as well as the spectroscopic features in the visible region.
Optical micrographs reported in Figure 5 show the presence of a broad distribution of microsized
pigment particles and large aggregates.

Figure 5 Optical micrographs of
Pigment Red 179 dispersions over cellulose
acetate films at different pigment contents. Scale bar = 350 μm.
(a) 2.5 wt %; (b) 5 wt %; (c) 10 wt % pigment.

The average diameter calculated on passing from 2.5 to 10 wt %
solid dispersions remained almost unchanged (about 3–5 μm),
whereas the variation of light intensity and sample color appeared
evident for pigment concentrations higher than 5 wt %. This behavior
agreed with the results gathered from reflectance experiments of pigment
dispersions over white substrates (Figure 2a), whose coverage resulted mostly complete
by using the dispersion with 5–10 wt % Pigment Red 179 concentration.
It is also well reported that diffuse reflection intensity depends
on the number of particle boundaries.40 By increasing pigment concentration, the coating layer contains
a large number of small micrometer-sized particles with high surface
area that possibly contribute to the higher NIR reflectance due to
the enhanced number of boundaries.

The color of the Pigment
Red 179 is mostly addressed to its planar
conjugated π-electron system, which causes strong absorption
in the visible region. The methyl substituent at the periphery of
the molecule is reported to be responsible for the energetic position
of the absorption maximum.41

Perylene
bisimides exhibit the electronic 0–0, 0–1
vibrational peaks and high energy 0–2 featureless shoulder
peaks in the region of 410–450 nm, which are usually fused
together in a broadened absorption band in chromophoric aggregates
in solution or in the solid state. In the case of Pigment Red 179
dispersions over cellulose acetate films, this broad absorption band
is located at about 480–490 nm and flanked by more growth of
shoulder peaks at the longer wavelengths of 570–580 nm. This
feature is in agreement with the formation of the typical face-to-face
chromophoric arrangements promoted by the strong intermolecular π–π
interactions, as analogously reported in the main literature.42−45 Notably, the ratio between the absorbances of these two contributions
did not seem affected by pigment concentration, thus suggesting that
the formation of large aggregates already occurred at the lowest 2.5
wt % content, as also evidenced by optical microscopy in Figure 5a. The band at lower
energies did not prevail over the molecular one even in a polyethylene
matrix (Figure 6, yellow
curve), which is considered the less compatible one with organic pigments
and its apolar and aliphatic nature is well known to strongly promote
the formation of large-scale chromophoric aggregates.46−50

Computational Analysis of Pigment Red 179 (PR179) Assemblies
Aimed at understanding the effect of the aggregation extent of
Pigment Red 179 molecules on their optical characteristics, a computational
analysis was carried out. We report in Figure 7 (left) the computed absorption spectrum
for an isolated PR179 molecule. The effect of solvent on the band
shape profile and transition character is negligible, as clearly shown
by comparison with calculations in ACN reported in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 7 Computed UV–vis
spectra of PR179 monomer (left) and isolated
dimer (right). Vertical red spikes represent computed vertical excitation
transitions, while blue lines are spectra obtained by Gaussian convolution
using a full width half-height of 0.33 eV. The orbitals involved in
transitions I and II are reported for CAM-B3LYP. No energy/wavelength
scaling has been employed.

The spectrum is dominated by two main transitions, all of a localized
character with a negligible intramolecular charge-transfer character.
Both transitions are basically π–π* excitations
corresponding to a HOMO → LUMO excitation for transition I
and to a HOMO – 1 → LUMO for II (see bottom left side
of Figure 7). This
assignment is consistent among the three levels of theory tested here,
with only a shift in energy in the computed spectra due to their different
Hartree-Fock exchange contents (up to 100 and ∼63% for long
interelectronic distances in LC-PBE and CAM-B3LYP, respectively, and
25% for the global hybrid PBE0). To model the effect of π–π
intermolecular interactions, a minimal model represented by a dimer
of PR179 molecules (refer to Computational Methods
section for details) was first considered and the results are
reported in Figure 7 (right side). As can be seen in Figure 7, bottom right panel, the nature of the main
transitions changes (I of the HOMO → LUMO type, and II of the
HOMO – 1 → LUMO + 1 type) but retains their localized
character, without any significant charge transfer, neither intra
nor intermolecular. To have an estimate of the charge-transfer distance
associated to these transitions, we employed the Dct index,51 which is basically
a measure of the hole–electron distance due to the photoexcitation.
We found Dct values of 0.06 and 0.09 Å
for excitations I and II, respectively: these small values, much smaller
than an average covalent bond distance, are fully consistent with
the notion of a localized transition (i.e., a transition with no charge
transfer involved).

CAM-B3LYP vertical excitations show absorption
in the blue-cyan
region of the visible spectrum (for the isolated pigment and dimer
model), while the absorption energies computed at the PBE0 level of
theory are significantly red-shifted with optical gaps in the orange
region of the visible spectrum, as expected due to the reduced amount
of Hartree-Fock exchange.52−56

The spectrum of the isolated dimer computed at CAM-B3LYP and
LC-PBE
levels shows no qualitative difference with respect to that of the
monomer but a slight red-shift of around 50 nm. The PBE0 spectra show
larger differences.

Nonetheless, to correctly simulate the crystalline
environment
effect on the optical spectra, as mentioned in the introduction, long-range
electrostatic effects have to be included. To this end, embedded TD-DFT
calculations were performed and the corresponding simulated spectrum
at the CAM-B3LYP level is reported in Figure 8 in the case of the dimer model, the minimal
one to check the existence of intermolecular CT transitions. The orbital
component of the first (I) and the second (II) transitions are reported
in Figure 8. Contrary
to the calculations performed in the absence of the crystalline potential,
here we can clearly see the presence of a transition (I at low energies
in red region when using the CAM-B3LYP functional), which shows a
clear intermolecular charge-transfer character (the Dct index51 estimates a charge-transfer
distance of ∼3.91 Å, consistent with the intermolecular
distance between PR179 molecules). This transition involved the HOMO
and LUMO orbitals localized on different molecules, whereas the second
one (II) is of the HOMO → LUMO + 1 type and does not show any
charge-transfer character. The predicted transition energies (at TD-CAM-B3LYP
level of theory) are λI = 605 nm and λII = 448 nm, corresponding to energies of 2.04 and 2.77 eV.
These absorption energies are in good agreement with the experimental
ones (2.13 and 2.69 eV, respectively, see Figure 6).

Figure 8 Computed UV–vis spectrum of PR179 dimer
embedded in the
electrostatic field of the crystal. Red spikes represent actual transitions,
while the blue line is the spectrum obtained by Gaussian convolution
using a full width half-height of 0.33 eV. The orbitals involved in
transitions I and II are reported for CAM-B3LYP. No energy/wavelength
scaling has been employed.

Calculations performed on embedded trimer and tetramer clusters
confirm the intermolecular charge transfer nature of the 1st transition:
the orbital involved in it belongs to two adjacent molecules, without
the creation of an extended exciton: these are reported in the Supporting
Information (Figures S4 and S5).

To investigate how both energies and intensity of the two bands
are affected by packing, we decided to monitor the variation in oscillator
strength and transition energies of the two bands as a function of
the intermolecular distance in the presence of the embedding potential.
Changing the intermolecular distance significantly affects the oscillator
strength of transition I, as reported in Figure 9. Here, it has be pinpointed that distances
much smaller than the experimental equilibrium value (of about ∼3.86
Å) might have little physical meaning, for at least two reasons:
(1) it is experimentally unfeasible to compress the crystal system
so far as to reach such short intermolecular contacts; (2) for very
short intermolecular distances, the orbital character of the S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 transitions may change drastically, giving rise to a discontinuous
behavior of both energy and oscillator strength; considering this
caveat, we report them anyway in Figure 9 (from 2.5 to 4 Å) for the sake of completeness.
When the distance decreases to about 15% with respect to the equilibrium
one, the UV–vis peak due to transition I matches the absorption
of transition II. To match the relative height of the two peaks, as
observed experimentally in Figure 6, a shrinkage of the intermolecular distance of about
6% is needed. The oscillator strength of a transition is in fact proportional
to its probability of occurrence, and, consequently, the calculations
show that the intensity of the intermolecular charge transfer increases
when the intermolecular distance decreases.

Figure 9 Oscillator strength (CAM-B3LYP
level of theory) and energies of
transitions I and II, as a function of the intermolecular distance.

While the energy of transition I remains remarkably
stable when
passing from intermolecular distances between ∼3.1 and ∼4.0
Å (corresponding to energy values of 1.85 and 2.06 eV, respectively),
the energy of transition II is instead more affected by the change
in this parameter, and, in particular, has an abrupt change between
3.2 and 3.1 Å. In fact, the energy of transition II decreases
significantly with compression of the embedded dimer model, with values
spanning the interval between 2.37 eV (d = 3.1 Å)
and 2.76 eV (d = 4.0 Å). This can be qualitatively
related to the experimentally observed red-shift of the band ascribed
to transition II from ∼460 nm (2.69 eV) to ∼490 nm (2.53
eV) when increasing the pigment concentration, as shown in Figure 6. The combined rise
of transition I and red-shift of transition II make the pigment darker
when the concentration is increased corresponding to a locally more
dense (closer) packing of the dimers. The results gathered from the
computational investigations strictly evidence how the optical features
of Pigment Red 179 are strongly affected by its aggregation extent.
As far as concentration increases in the supporting polymer matrix,
a compact and crystalline-like structure governed by π–π
stacking interactions grows, thus inducing the progressive emersion
of the low-energy absorption CT band that, in turn, contributes to
the overall color of the pigment.

Concluding Remarks
In this work, we investigate, by means of a combined approach of
density functional theory calculations and vis–NIR experiments,
the effects due to aggregation on the optical properties of Pigment
Red 179, particularly on its color and NIR reflective features. Experimental
spectra show that the pigment coverage and NIR reflective features
are strongly dependent on the chromophore content. Notably, on passing
from 2.5 to 10 wt % pigment concentration, 75% of light reflection
was recovered in the 700–1600 nm wavelength window, which,
in turn, produces a cooling effect of about 5 °C of the black
coated surface. Calculations addressed this evidence to be due to
an intermolecular charge-transfer excitation, which becomes more probable
as the molecules get closer in agreement with their X-ray diffraction
spectra. This work provides new insights on the aggregation-induced
absorption and on the development of modern paints that offer a colored
coverage to the different substrates without contributing to their
heating during light exposure.
